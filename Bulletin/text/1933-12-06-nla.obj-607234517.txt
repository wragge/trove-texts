Propaganda Novels
The propaganda classics of the nine-
teenth century were written with inside
knowledge. Before Dickens attacked,
say, the Poor Laws he made a point of
learning about them and their implica-
tions. Whether he was assailing work-
houses, child labor, slums or the Came
Laws he not only took care to find out
what was wrong, he also formed a clear
idea of what was needed to put things
right. So he got results. The literary
reformers of to-day are as distressed as
he was by the sorrows of the poor, but
they have no constructive remedies to
offer. Also, the Jingo press seems to
have cowed them. The social novelists
and >ets of the Victorian era did not
r : . J being called Radicals; the social
r? of to-day are terrified of being
called Bolsheviks. As a result their
works ,'v: e riddles without answers.
Mr. Priestley’s latest book is an
. - another kind of propaganda
>. v* ** L is also inspired by indigna-
* «te indignation is of an ignoble
.nr. ;,c These books resemble lampoons,
ud women do them best. No man could
have drawn the husband of “The Cara-
vanners”; Elinor Mordaunt wrote a
novel about a novelist (said to be Somer-
set Maugham) which was so hurtful that
the publishers had to withdraw it, and
many other cases may be cited. There
is internal evidence that John Lovegood,
the writer of a remarkable novel about
Westralia, is a woman..
“ Willing to Wound ; Afraid to Strike”
Wonder Hero (Heinemann ; Dymocks ;
7s. 6d.) is Charlie Habble, of Associated
Coal Products, Utterton. Charlie is the
working-lad of every sentimentalist’s
dream ; as incredibly well-behaved and
dull as Eric of “Little by Little.” He
isn’t a hero ; the title is ironical. It was
conferred on him by a “Daily Tribune”
sensation-monger for allegedly extin-
guishing a fire at the A.C.P. works. The
fire was actually extinguished by a young
Bolshevik on the run from the police.
The “Tribune” booms Charlie in Lon-
don, and Mr. Priestley uses his experi-
ences as texts for diatribes against the
English social system. Most of those
whom the lad meets are familiar. The
despicable stunt editor; the still more
despicable tyrant who employs him ; the
patrons of the Cafe Pompadour (“a
place where a lot of rich fashionable
fools know they’ll see a lot of other
rich fashionable fools”); the guests at
Lady Catterbird’s cocktail party —all have
been held, up to the scorn of honest men
and women by hundreds of democratic
writers. Charlie wanders smugly among
them making inane remarks about their
behavior, and then his creator transfers
him to Slakely, described sardonically as
“This Other Eden.”
Factory chimneys with no smoke com-
ing out of them. Charlie’s under-
nourished uncle and aunt. The usual
shouting, cursing, noble old doctor whom
nobody can afford to pay. Stunted, C. 3
unemployables everywhere. “If I thought
it would get us out of this I’d turn
Bolshie to-morrow,” roars the doctor;
but he is careful to add that he “doesn’t
like Bolshevism.” Neither does Charlie’s
fine old uncle, but he has some bitter
things to say about capitalism.
“How in the name of thunder can them banks
afford to build places like that? If they’re on
our side, an’ muckin’ in wi’ us, then they ought
to be having a slump, too. Instead o’ that
they’re building marble palaces.”
The doctor states what appears to be
Mr. Priestley’s economic policy (“If I’d
my way I’d give every unemployed man
four pounds a week to-morrow, and
make him spend every penny of it”),
and Charlie, like the dummy he is, stam-
mers fatuous objections. But both doctor
and author warily leave it at that. No
attempt is made to show how the Govern-
ment would raise the necessary billions,
how the unemployed would spend the
money, or how those in work would
react to the spec-
tacle of others
being prodigal at
their expense.
Charlie wins
the love of a nice
girl, and the
young Bolshevik already mentioned —a
genuine hero —begins a prison sentence,
inflicted by a class-biassed, doddering
qld magistrate, as the story ends.
Hate
There are only three characters who
matter in The Partners (Gollancz;
Dymocks; 7s. 6d.): Vera, an English
shop-girl; Sam Lawson, a Westralian
profiteer Who has just married her.; and
Tim Kennedy. Vera asks about Tim in
the train on the way to Geraldton.
“Oh, Tim, he’s a sort of partner of mine,”
said Sam scornfully. “He’s the man I’ve come
yall this way north to see. You’ll see him for
yourself to-morrow. He and I have been
running a little show of our own on the strict
q.t. for the last eight months.”
Tim has found gold. He is waiting for
them at Geraldton. Tall, lean, bronzed,
shy; Vera rather likes him. Sam wants
to take her to Whelarra next day, but
she develops a headache and stays be-
hind. She runs across Tim during the
day and spends the night with him.
The two men are seen throughout with
her eyes, and she knows them, and their
innermost desires and ways, as only such
a woman could. She hates Sam —a hard,
gross sensualist without a redeeming
spark of kindness or pity—and she
doesn’t care for Tim, who is a fool; yet
physically both appeal to her. Sam re-
turns, he and Tim set out for the reef,
and the best and most hideous part of
the book begins.
The description of the partners’ ride
across the parched red desert; the
analysis of their thoughts about Vera
and each other (Sam wonders if he can
swindle Tim, Tim if he can leave Sam
to die without incurring suspicion); the
account of their subsequent agonies—it is
all done with consummate skill. Every
sentence they utter, every obscene
thought that passes through their minds,
every action they perform, is in character.
They are held up to scorn with zest, and
their sufferings are recorded in much the
same spirit. It is easy to picture John
Lovegood hovering over them in spirit
and remarking complacently that they
deserved it.
An attempt is made to justify Vera ;
it is perhaps the one definitely weak
feature of the book. No esoteric in-
fluences were at work in her case. She
is a fairly common female type ; as cold-
blooded and sensual as Sam, and equally
selfish and untrustworthy. Sam knows
all about her. The only essential dif-
ference between them is that, being
quarter of a century younger, she is less
hardened and cynical.
A masterly study of the darker places
of human nature. If John Lovegood is
an Australian, then this country has at
least one writer with vision, however
morbid, and supreme powers of self-
expression.
RED PAGE.
Two Poets
It is not important that Mary Lang is
only 17. Her vision goes far beyond the
range of the prodigy ; her verse has none
of the prodigy’s cleverness, his conscious
music. Certainly, in Strange Battalion
(Dent; Angus and Robertson) she re-
joices in the faults of youth; porten-
tousness, over-decoration, the melo-
dramatic line, the sudden defiant collo-
quialism, the echo. But her faults have
their own individuality and should in
time bear rich fruit.
For example,
Come, love me while you may;
Perhaps we’re only here to-day. -
There are so few hours we can bless
With all our happiness..,.
An echo of Herrick, but an echo of his
sweetness as well as his skill.
For the moment her stage is held by a
sweeping eloquence of image at times
remarkable in glow and intensity, by
delight in mass and volume, and by a
potent tenderness for tangible everyday

rheumatic twinges, bladder disorder, it is certain

The kidneys are not carrying out their work properly,
and poisons such as uric acid in excess and other impurities,
instead of passing out of the body, accumulate in the systenj.

irritable, weak and worn-out.

of that pain."

things. This is all in flux, sometimes very
unwieldy, sometimes clear and firm, as in
COWS.
I love cows; they are so calm and solid
and so untemperamental. Cows are kind;
they glow and steam with rich attractive smells,
and chew a placid cud and are content.
They stand and dream in lush grass to the knees,
with horny hoofs deep-bedded in the slime
that lies below. They dream in other worlds
and do not heed the nagging gnats that swarm
around their straight, broad backs. I have
known calves
awkward and gaping like blank idiots,
yet I have bowed before the age-old wisdom
which sent them running to their mothers
at my approach, for fear I’d steal their birth-
right. , .
Oh, to be born with peace for heritage!
I know there is some peace still in the world;
perhaps the cows have all of it. And Man
still slides and scrambles after shadow things,
and grasping all, still loses more; and so
I have not known the happiness of cows.
In Wardens of the Seas (Endeavour
Press) we listen to E. J. Brady’s fine
resonant voice in swinging sea-songs. The
measured rhythm marches on, the song
reaches its climax, the music fades,
ceases. Mostly in the timeless dream, the
ancient song of the sea.
The chantey pattern is traditional, no
doubt; a hundred singers have used it
well or ill, and here and there a master,
such as Brady. Many a year his voice
has sounded now, always rich, full of
music, clear and satisfying ; and his voice
is enough for our enjoyment. Sometimes
he adds an extra depth to the pattern: —•
Out, let us out on the roads once more
That circle the North away,
To eat our curry in Singapore
And chatter in Straits Malay. _
From Darwin down to the Philippine,
From Rabaul round to Rangoon,
A siren sits in her sarong fine,
And this is the siren’s tune:
“/ am the lady who lives by Achen,
Come ye, my children, oh, come ye, my men !
Kayoh, laju —
I am the maiden who sleeps by Sulu —
Come you again, oh, my lover untrue !
Kayoh, laju —
Spelled by my voice and adream of my charms.
Come you again, oh, my love, to my arms !
Kayoh, laju-laju”
Sometimes the resonant voice falls to
a simpler, sweeter cadence:' —
Long mute are woman voices
That prayed their safe return,
Long since the votive candles
On altars ceased to burn ;
And hearts that nightly listened

HILARY LOFTING.
More Sand and Sob Stuff
Twenty-five years ago it was an axiom
that nothing written in Australia was a
book unless it dealt with Dad and Dave.
Then the Nat Gould tradition had its
turn. Since Lasseter’s Last Ride after
the Lost Reef Central Australia has be-
come the popular background. A dozen
publishers seem to be turning out books
about that arid spot by people who have
never been there and feel that it
is a sort of second Eden or by people
who have and wish to capitalise their
consequent dejection, or somebody else’s.
Ungamillia, by Stuart McDonald (Dea-
ton and Spencer; 65.), is a little of
each. It begins with the “sun glaring
with white-hot intensity on an expanse
of yellow, sandy earth —devoid of vege-
tation.” (The prevailing Centralian color,
by the way, is salmon pink.) Then it
proceeds through “grime, caked blood
even,” to “Ah, God-have-you-no-pity,”
as the poor woman “threw herself
prostrate across the child’s body, shelter-
ing it as best she could from the wither-
ing rays of the sun.” Of course, from
this stepping-stone it is easy to reach the
handsome anthropologist and the beauti-
ful native-nurtured girl and the happy
ending.
The time is coming when a Herod
will be badly needed to specialise
in destroying the first-born of Centralian
romanticists. Otherwise a few decent
booksellers will be smothered under their
fast-multiplying works.
“X.”
This Imperfect Country
Jean Irwin (R.P. 22/11/’33) utters a
bitter plaint because Australia is full of
cricketers and footballers and their fans
and not of intellectuals. What does she
expect otherwise? Plato doesn’t give
the impression that Socrates walked
about an Athens crammed with poets,
artists, philosophers and heroes, even in
the Golden Age of Greek civilisation.
On the contrary, he moved among people
who misunderstood him. Eventually
they poisoned him, and quite rightly,
from their point of view. If they had
adopted his views the State would have
flown to pieces.
Nature does not strive after the excep-
tional and the particular. It seeks to per-
petuate mediocrity. The unusual it casts
forth.
Miss Irwin quotes with approval Prof.
Allen as saying that “if a man has ability
to follow a profession he will forsake
literature, and if he has not the ability
to forsake literature he will forsake Aus-
tralia.” It is just the foolish sort of
thing a professor who indulges in the
foolish job of book censorship would
say. If a man has the ability to follow
literature he will follow literature. If
he abandons it for a profession, that is
a sure indication that he hasn’t the par-
ticular ability— i.e., the knowledge—for
following literature. The implication
that a profession is necessarily a lower
form of activity is also a form of intel-
lectual snobbery.
If a good literary man forsakes Aus-
tralia that does not necessarily indicate
that good literary men can’t function in
Australia. Mark Twain functioned in
America at a time when that country was
in much the same parlous intellectual con-
dition as Australia. Nietzsche produced
immortal work at a time when, accord-
ing to his own depositions, Germany was
sunk in the deepest moral and mental
turpitude, so much so that he dared to
print only six copies of one of his most
important books and got rid of only
three of them. It was precisely that
moral and mental turpitude which gave
him his subject matter. If Australia is
in the dreadful state described by Jean
Irwin, what a golden opportunity for a
literary man to do what Nietzsche did —
or what Sinclair Lewis did for America
with “Babbitt”! If there is no literary
man doing this in Australia, that is be-
cause there is none with the necessary
ability— i.e., courage ; i.e., knowledge
Australia, like every other country, is
full of people doing ignoble things and
telling themselves that they could do
really noble things. “I could do big
things,” they say, “if only” The “if
only” shows that they can’t do the big
things, they can only yearn to do them.
The flapper yearns to be a great lover, the
commercial artist to be a Rembrandt, the
journalist to write a Shakspearean
drama. There is great comfort in yearn-
ing for things, whereas doing them in-
volves discomfort and hardship.
If Australia were entirely populated by
intellectuals it would be a terrible place.
We should all be agreeing with one an-
other. There would be nothing to write
about. Miss Irwin would have no justi-
fication for writing jeremiads. Prof.
Allen would be out of the job of book
censorship. That is, if a community of
intellectuals meant perfect wisdom. For-
tunately it wouldn’t. It would be just
as imperfect a community as the present
one of footballers and cricketers. For
the literary artist to complain because
Australia is so infinitely varied, so com-
plex, so full of different sorts of people
would be folly. The painter does not
complain because Nature doesn’t solve
his problems for him. He gets to work
on them.
The craving for “comradeship, under-
standing, kindred enthusiasm” i,s, of
course, natural. We all like to be appre-
ciated. It is the gregarious instinct speak-
ing. If the great literary artist Miss
Irwin longs for doesn’t get appreciation
from this generation it is a pity;
but it needn’t stop him working. The
next generation will erect the statues to
him, and hold annual pilgrimages to his
grave, and moan about the absence of
great guns like him in their own age.
F. S.
Publisher and Bookseller
I talked to a publisher recently who
was full of complaints about booksellers.
The bookseller, he seemed to think, was
an avaricious monster who did his
damnedest to prevent books being sold
in large numbers. The publisher declared
that but for the bookseller and his re-
cognised commission of 33 1-3 p.c., it
would be possible to sell books at much
lower prices than is at present the case,
and lower prices would, of course, mean
greater sales.
The blame seems to me to lie with
the publisher rather than with the book-
seller. At first glance a commission of
2s. for selling a 6s. book may seem exor-
bitant, but, since the bookseller has to
accept all the risks, it isn’t a profiteering
charge. The bookseller has to order his
stocks largely on the advance publicity
of the publisher, and not only does he
have to pay for them before he sells
them, but he isn’t permitted to send back
unsaleable copies. He must carry a large
stock and cater for all tastes. Naturally,
he can’t avoid losses. Taking those
things into consideration, a commission
of one-third the published price is a fair
enough thing.
But if it wasn’t for the publisher the
bookseller could probably afford to
charge less. It’s the number of books
published annually that keeps prices up,
the bookseller being required to stock
more than is economically profitable.
And then there’s the question of reprints ;
of cheap editions which follow hard
upon the heels of the higher-priced
editions.
If ever there was an industry that
needed rationalising it is publishing, and
the first step should be the imposition
of a limit on the number of books to be
published annually. Next, publishers
should contract not to issue a cheaper
edition until a sufficient period has
elapsed since the publication of the high-
priced edition. Those two decisions
alone would make a tremendous differ-
ence, not only to the bookseller, but also
to the publisher.
HENRY BATESON.
A Satchel of Books
The Fanatics, by Charles Bonner, Jun.
(John Heritage ; 7s. 6d.). A period novel
which carries the story of an American
family, the Canterburys, through the
years of American expansion between
1897 and modern times. The rise of
U.S.A. industry coincides with the decline
of the family, which is painted against a
vivid but somewhat ugly background of
teeming life and ceaseless struggle. The
characterisations are good, and the book
is something more than a novel.
Pack horse and Water hole, by Gordon
Buchanan (Angus and Robertson;
7s. 6d.). A plain, straightforward bio-
graphy of Nat Buchanan, Australia’s
greatest drover, by his son. The title is
appropriate. The tale smells of camp
life throughout and sounds like a yarn
told beside a drover’s fire. The author’s
unassuming literary style and modesty
are object-lessons for writers of family
biographies, and the book has a special
historical value in that it embalms stories
—never before told authoritatively—
of some of the greatest pioneering feats
accomplished in North Australia.
Walk With Care, by Patricia Went-
worth (Cassell; 7s. 6d.), is one of those
mystery yarns in the writing of which
women novelists seem to excel. The
beautiful blackmailer, the disappearing
publicist, the faithful secretary and the
almost incredible sleuth grow in profu-
sion in the pages. Mystery, thrills, crime,
love, potential murder light the path along
which the young hero walks to hear the
fatal words of acceptance which entitle
him to keep the heroine in bread and
butter and lingerie for ever. It is typical
Patricia Wentworth stuff —but the lady’s
technique seems to improve with prac-
tice, of which she has had a great deal
in mystery-story writing.
The Man from Scapa Flow, by “Taff-
rail” (Hodder and Stoughton; 7s. 6d.).
This is a good type of sea-mystery yarn
based on the salvaging of the German
Fleet interned in the Flow. There is a
mysterious German, one Herman Bauer,
ex-German R.N., who shows an inordi-
nate anxiety to recover the contents of
a safe in the sunken Prinzregent
Rudolph, and there are two brave British
naval officers who plan successfully with
others to circumvent the villain’s machi-
nations.- It is an exciting yarn and easy
to read. Everything ends satisfactorily,
too. Mr. Bauer goes over a cliff, and the
heroes, having done the decent thing by
his widow, are discovered drinking coffee
and liqueurs with their wives as the cur-
tain falls. What would the English
novelists do for a living if there were no
such function as dinner?
In the Midst of the Years, by Joan
Sutherland (Cassell; 65.), belongs to the
private-secretary-heroine school of Eng-
lish novel, written for the 20-year-old
public whose sophistication is of the
modern sort, and whose ambitions have
been nurtured in public schools and uni-
versities. The hero is, of course, a poli-
tician who suffers from an excess of pas-
sion which he proceeds to expend in
marriage with a young lady with a figure
like a Hollywood brunette and a mind
like a bit of badly-burnt cork. Natur-
ally, he turns from her shortcomings to his
politics for solace, but, instead of raising
his own salary and getting tangled up in
wheat subsidies and appointing the
wrong people to Leg. Councils, he sets
out to fight the wicked press lords of
the country, to their complete discom-
fiture. If one feels that anybody who
fights press lords is not a genuine poli-
tician, allowances must be made. This
M.P. had a perfect private secretary, and
nobody can marry perfect private secre-
taries without doing something unusual
first.
The “Telegraph ” Christmas Pictorial
(the “Telegraph,” Brisbane ; Is.) is com-
posed almost entirely of a fine selection of
photographs dealing with the varied
beauty spots and phases of life in
Bananaland. An interesting publication
for presentation to friends here and
abroad.

FIVEPENCE A LOAF.
Let us rejoice, for the cost of living is
down! The fall can’t be seen with the
naked eye, but the statisticians assure us
that the price-levels of food and groceries
respectively declined 0.5 p.c. and 0.4 p.c.
in 30 towns for October as against Sep-
tember figures.
Their calculations did not apply to
staple articles like bread and meat and
sugar, of which the average Australian
eats more than any other commodities.
Flour certainly did weaken a little (only
to rise again in November), but flour
prices are not re-translated into bread
prices unless the rise in the former is
equal to £1 per ton. However, acces-
sories like eggs, potatoes and tinned
fruits have had their price-edges rubbed
off—for the consumer, that is ; the pro-
ducer wonders whether the corpus of his
price may not disappear altogether.
This question of food prices is co..
plex. It matters more than wages. A
permanently high level of wages means
an equally high level of demand ; and
strong demand almost always generates
buoyancy beyond economic price-levels.
Whereupon wages have to be raised
again to take care of the surplus over
true value, and that makes more buoy-
ancy. But a permanently low level of
prices (with plenty of allowance for
buoyancy) is another story altogether.
Why we have not been able to obtain
it is one of those mysteries which give
economists headaches.
Several inquiries have been held into
the price of bread. A. B. Piddington,
who has always been a patient investi-
gator of facts, though his opinions are
not widely shared, presented a report to
the N.S.W. Parliament on the subject in
1932. Dealing with the bakery business,
he said:
No industry is so simple and constant in
the main economic features of demand and
supply The amount of bread consumed
per head in Australia is constant at 41b. per
head per week. Being immediately consumable,
the necessary output limits itself for each
factory to a quantity that is known almost with
exactitude from day to day.
There is no appreciable waste, no
scarcity of raw material, no change
of fashion —to-day’s loaf varies little
from the loaf of 1914. The industry
is one of the most peaceful known.
Moreover, the basis of all baking be-
comes cheaper instead of dearer. But the
price of bread seems able to move only
in one dimension: it can and does float
upwards whenever opportunity offers,
but downward it rarely goes, and then
with a slothful and reluctant step.
The Inter-State Commission at the end
of the war vetted existing conditions and
appeared to think 3id. to 4d. a fair price
for a 21b. loaf. Wheat was then 4s. 9d.
per bushel; flour was £lO 17s. 6d.
in some capitals and up to £ 12 in others.
Day baking, of course, was in operation
in some States, as later. The basic wage
in the industry was, perhaps, 15 per cent,
less than at present. Wages now, on that
basis, should represent about one-sixth
of the cost of producing a 41b. loaf
against one-seventh then. The commis-
sion calculated that with flour at its then
current price a fall in wheat of 13.2 d.
per bushel should mean a fall of Id. in a
41b. loaf. Twelve years later, a Vic-
torian Commission, which examined 150
witnesses, found that the flour in a 41b.
loaf, which cost 6.502 d. to
accounted for 4d. or 4£d. with wheat at
£ll per ton. It calculated that a decline
of £1 7s. 6d. in the cost of flour per ton
should bring the 41b. loaf down 4-d. in
price.
But where is the response to these prin-
ciples? It was certainly evident when,
between 1919-21, flour rose from £ll to
£l9 a ton and wheat from 4s. 9d. to 9s.
per bushel. Bread went up then from
34d. minimum and 4d. maximum in the
various capitals (21b. loaf) to sd. min.
and 6d. max. But when flour came down
to £l6 7s. in 1925 bread was still around
for the 21b. loaf; and in 1932, with
flour at £lO and wheat completely in the
doldrums, that price was unchanged
materially. In 1933, with wheat still
lower —under 3s. in Sydney against the
4s. 9d. which it cost at the time of the
Inter-State Commission inquiry, when the
21b. loaf was 4d. or less —the price of
bread still hangs round 5d., though flour
has responded to the wheat-price reduc-
tion and is £7 10s. to the baker in Mel-
bourne, £8 15s. in Brisbane —where the
wheat price is artificial —and £9 in Sydney,
where the State flour-tax is included.
The N. S. Wales tax is to come off.
Even allowing for the wage increase, the
loaf price should be nearer 3d. than its
present level; but let anybody try to
reduce it at his peril!
The flour and bread interests brook no
price-cutting. That Victorian commission
found that, though the Vic. Master
Bakers’ Association had several objects,
Its chief function is undoubtedly to aim at
maintaining fixed prices for bread Such is
the influence of bakers that there are cases where
the miller has taken the extreme action of re-
fusing to supply the offender with flour.
In N. S. Wales, any member of the
public who learns anything of the millers’
financial position must feel as the Antarc-
tic explorer does when he sees his first
Aurora Australis. Detailed figures are
not published. Shares are never quoted
on the Stock Exchange. During the
depression, while the value of N.S.W.
mill plants and buildings has been
written down about £140,000 —say 8 p.c.—
their average number of employees has
increased substantially and they have
treated 22.5 per cent, more wheat.
At the Piddington inquiry it came out
that the master bakers owed millers
£BOO,OOO, which seemed to smack of a
system of “tied houses” and subsidised
businesses in the light of the short-term-
credit habits of the trade. However, case
after case showed that, whatever their
relations, millers and bakers were at one
in thought and action when price-cutting
was in the wind:
Evidence was voluminous and convincing that
millers refuse to supply flour to the under-
cutter The compilation of a black list was
proved.
Letters like the following were pro-
duced :
On turning up our records we find you have
fallen foul of the Master Bakers’ Association.
Can you tell us the reason? Otherwise we are
afraid we cannot supply y0u....
The recipient went in vain from mill to
mill. He had tried to give cheaper
bread and he was doomed. Even his
supply of yeast was cut off.
It has been said openly by master
millers that the sales tax on flour which
is to save the struggling wheat-farmers
must be passed on to the master bakers.
The master bakers are just as frank that
they will pass it on to the public in the
shape of an increase in the price of bread.
Lyons and the State Premiers have a duty
in the matter. Present wage-rates can-
not stand a further rise in the price of
bread, and there is no justification for it.
If the price moves at all it should, in
the light of every finding on the industry
since the war, be reduced. Not nearly
enough daylight has been shed on the
doings of the trade which supplies our
most universally used commodity.
CHURCH AND STATE.
The world is rarely free from quarrels
between Church and State. This century
has witnessed many, and is going to wit-
ness more. True, the old dispute between
the Vatican and the Quirinal has been
settled —it is one of Mussolini’s outstand-
ing achievements —but in France, Russia,
Mexico and Spain the supremacy of the
civil power over the spiritual power has
been asserted in our time ; in at least
two cases, violently. In other countries
conflicts of a kind unknown to former
generations are arising, and Australia is
sure to be involved.
The Great Powers, Japan and the
U.S.A. excepted, came out of the war
with a great preponderance of females
and an increased proportion of C 3 per-
sons—feeble-minded, degenerate. During
the four years of fighting, the fit perished
on the battlefields, millions of them ; the
unfit remained at home and multiplied. It
has been estimated that every tenth in-
habitant of Britain is subnormal. Be this
as it may, the 1931 census showed that
British females outnumbered British
males by 1,870,568 ; the figures were
23,401,726 and 21,531,158. In Germany
the excess of females is upwards of
2,000,000. For roughly 9 p.c. of British
women and 7 p.c. of German women,
marriage is out of the question. The
position is made more difficult by the
fact that the Established Church of Eng-
land and the Catholic Church, which pre-
dominates in South Germany, are against
divorce. Judge Parry has argued that
there is no warrant in the English Bible
for the attitude of the Anglican bishops ;
but they persist in it, refusing to marry
divorced persons or to recognise what
the State, within narrow limits, permits.
A royal commission composed of some
of the most eminent men in the realm
went into the matter of the British
divorce laws before the war, and a majo-
rity recommended that they should be
liberalised. Anglican and R.C. Church
•influence was thrown against the majority
report, and no Government has dared to
introduce legislation on the lines pro-
posed. This is perhaps not to be wondered
at; in Australia, which has no established
church, we have seen one Common-
wealth Government after another, fear-
ful of the church vote, refuse to bring
in uniform marriage and divorce laws,
although the necessary power was en-
trusted to the Commonwealth Parliament
by the people, and although the existence
of six sets of divorce laws, each insisting
on a local domicile, has notoriously in-
flicted hardship on great numbers of
persons, particularly poor persons.
The question whether Parliament is to
be the- acknowledged legislator in the
field of divorce, or whether the Estab-
lished Church is to remain an unacknow-
ledged legislator, is about to be tested in
Britain. A group of private members—
responding, consciously or unconsciously,
to the demand of unmated womanhood
for a less restricted marriage market—has
introduced a bill providing that divorce
may be granted to either party to a mar-
riage on the following grounds:
Adultery, desertion for three years, cruelty,
lunacy, incurable drunkenness, imprisonment
under a commuted death sentence, and absence
without cause or explanation for seven years.
The lunacy clauses go far beyond what
A. S. Henry proposed in the measure
which the N.S.W. Leg. Assembly flat-
tened out on the second reading by 50
to 8, and what Attorney-General Men-
zies proposes in Victoria.
Nullity is to be obtainable on the grounds of
unsound mind at the time of marriage, the
development of mental instability within six
months and liability to fits of insanity and
epilepsy.
Oddly enough, while Anglican bishops
are so set against divorce, many of them
are strongly in favor of sterilisation of
the unfit. The new rulers of Germany
propose to practise what these prelates
preach. They bluntly declare that Ger-
many cannot afford, in any sense of the
term, to pay human refuse to bring more
human refuse into the world. So they
have passed a sterilisation law, which is
to come into force on the first of January.
The Nazis recently arranged a concor-
dat with Rome. Although they made no
secret of their sterilisation plans, which
extend to the cases of those who, for one
reason or another, are willing to undergo
the operation, they could scarcely look for
approval in that quarter. Nevertheless,
it is improbable that they expected that
their law would be resisted. Resisted it
is evidently to be. The Pope, in an
Encyclical, declares that “public authori-
ties do not possess power over human
bodies, and may not directly damage
their integrity for eugenic or any other
reasons.” The Vatican newspaper has
gone further:
Governments are not sociological inspec-
torates, and nations cannot be changed into
breeding studs.
It is now given out that Catholic
doctors are forbidden to sterilise patients
and Catholic nurses to assist at such
operations ; and that those persons who
have been voluntarily sterilised “cannot
contract valid marriage.” So a great
struggle is impending between the church
to which so many Germans belong and
the new German State; and no other
country will be able to contemplate it
with the comfortable feeling that it is
“above the battle.”
Mankind is born to trouble as the
sparks fly upward ; and in the clash of
beliefs held by good people, who all aim
at promoting individual happiness and
the improvement of the race, it is apt to
come in strange and difficult forms.
“THE SPEEDWAY TO
PROSPERITY.”
The Commonwealth Parliament is put-
ting the finishing touches to a melancholy
chapter in the history of loan-settlement.
The last act in the matter, except for the
signing of a cheque, is a bill to legalise
the payment of £lOO,OOO, of which the
Commonwealth is in sore need, to deluded
Britons who were induced to come to
Victoria by the flattering tales of Govern-
ment propagandists.
Every settler who decides not to go on
wrestling with his holding is to be freed
of all liability to the Crown and local
authorities and to receive monetary com-
pensation. The amounts range from £2OO
for a single man or widower to £3OO for
each married man, with an additional £5O
for each child now dependent on the
claimant who came to Australia with him,
no total to exceed £5OO. Exchange is to be
paid on amounts sent abroad. Personal
debts, also, are to be met in certain cir-
cumstances. One settler in every three
has elected to take cash. The balance
remain on their farms, at a cost to Vic-
toria of £350,000. It is a costly admis-
sion of misrepresentation in disgraceful
circumstances. Those who stay on their
blocks will have their liabilities and
charges drastically reduced.
The trouble arose out of agreements
entered into between the British Govern-
ment and the Commonwealth and between
the Commonwealth and Victoria under
the Empire Settlement Act of 1922. The
Commonwealth undertook to borrow
£3,000,000 to put Britons on Victorian
farms. Each migrant was to receive
£3OO on loan from Britain, and the
State was to provide the land, improve it,
organise the training of the would-be
farmers and, if the need were shown, add
£2OO to the original loan. On the aver-
age, loans and advances were not ?o
exceed £l5OO, which was to be paid back
by half-yearly instalments over 36| years
at the rate of 6 p.c. p.a., inclusive both
of interest and redemption.
The agreement was signed in April,
1923. Immediately recruiting of migrants
began in London through the Agent-
General’s office. The first pamphlet
issued informed would-be immigrants that
the scheme “would appeal to the middle
classes.” Says the Royal Commission,
headed by Chief Arbitration Judge
Dethridge, which inquired into the
matter last year:
Assurances were given to the intending
settlers that if they worked hard they would,
after the first few years, be receiving net
incomes ranging from £4OO a year upward, with
a fair prospect of reaching an independent posi-
tion in 15 or 20 years.
And while the Commissioners did not
think they could be taken as guarantees,
such statements were
positive anticipatory estimates which were
intended to raise, and did in fact raise, the
expectations of those to whom they were given
so high as to induce them to abandon their
positions and prospects elsewhere and go to
Victoria.
A second pamphlet was issued: “Victoria,
the Speedway to Rural Prosperity.”
To quote the Commissioners again:
Much of the “speedway” consisted of such
turgid panegyrics or farming. conditions in Vic-
toria—somewhat like the salesman’s puffing
generalities which most people have learned to
discard largely when not uttered on behalf of
Governments —that the expectations of intend-
ing settlers were almost certain to be unduly
inflated.
Contemporaneously, the Commonwealth
was at work. Its splurges were equally
extravagant. It said, for instance, that
“the Mallee held no fear for the settler,”
and that wheat-growing there had “ceased
to be a gamble with nature and become
a clear-cut business proposition.”
Over some of the subsequent pro-
ceedings it is as well to draw a veil.
Settlements were to be at Katandra,
where within 10 years 2016 migrants
without capital (as well as some with
capital) were to be absorbed, and at
Maffra, where 2705 unendowed migrants
were to settle. Luckily, the quotas were
far from filled.
In 1930, 233 settlers were on their
blocks, but 95 had left after six months’
occupation. The Commission believed
that the migrants themselves had no con-
tractual rights, but the British Govern-
ment had. However, in “nearly every
case” the settlers had a “just claim,” and,
though the State was liberal with ad-
vances, having a plentiful supply of easy
money, conditions were not such as to
“provide a living and all commitments.”
The opportunity generally fell far short
of what the settler was entitled to expect.
The business should be a lesson to
Government propagandists; but in all
probability it won’t be. If untravelled
Australians could see the shocking mis-
representations of Australian official pub-
licists in London —as well as the equally
shameful ignorance of some of them —it
would give them palpitation of the heart.
Summed up, this latest of many loan-
settlement fiascos is costing Australia
£lOO,OOO in cash and £350,000 in cancel-
lation of liabilities. And, apparently, not
a penny can be recovered from the guilty
parties, nor can anyone be put in gaol.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Double Number Next Week.
Next week’s Bulletin will be a .blend
of the customary issue and the Christmas
Number. It will include stories by Nor-
man Lindsay (with two typical Lindsay
illustrations), Henrietta Drake-Brock-
man, Randolph Bedford, Harold Mercer,
Roderic Quinn and the new South
Australian humorist J. B. Blair. Nor-
man Lindsay, Scorfield, B. E. Minns and
a host of others provide the art. There
will be 68 pages, and all for sixpence.

Legalised Robbery.
Spooner, the N.S.W. Assistant-Treasurer,
has said so many wise things about the
Douglas social credit scheme, the poli-
tical control of banking and the absurdi-
ties of the Lang plan that perhaps an
occasional foolish utterance may be for-
given. He made a very stupid remark
when Lazzarini raised the question of the
rise in the price of milk, cynically an-
nounced during Health and Milk Week.
“The Sydney public is being exploited,”
said the member for Marrickville ; “and
it will be a scandal and a disgrace if the
Government permits it.” “Why waste the
time of this House,” Spoonef interposed,
“simply because you have to pay an
extra penny a quart?”
Lazzarini did not waste the time of
the House, nor should Spooner’s Govern-
ment, which is responsible to the people
for the control system, tolerate the ex-
tortion of 7d. a quart—Bd. in some places,
and more delivered in bottles —from a
public which should be paying no more
than sd.
As a Royal Commissioner has shown,
Sydney, if trade were permitted to take
its natural course, would get two or three
times the quantity of milk to which it has
been restricted since the board was set
up. North and south of the city there
is some of the finest dairying country in
the world. A North Coast member of
the Ministry has pointed out that the
cow-farmers engaged in this restricted
trade are, under the control system, get-
ting twice as much for their milk as
farmers who send their milk to butter
factories and whose produce is so largely
exported. And vendors, some of whom
are the board’s agents, are receiving
more than the farmers. Agents who
buy at Is. Id. a gallon and sell
at 2s. Bd. and more are on about
the best wicket in the world.
In August it was reported that the
N.I.R.A. people in America were having
some difficulty in adjusting the price of
milk in Chicago. An association con-
trolling about 75 p.c. of the milk drunk
in that city was selling at nine cents a
quart, whereas independent dealers buy-
ing from 2000 farmers were charging
6{ cents. Certainly the American gallon
is smaller than our imperial gallon, con-
taining 231 cubic inches as against
277.274; all the same, these Chicago
prices are astounding, especially as on
a gold basis the dollar has fallen as low
as 2s. 6d. as against the old equivalent
of 4s. 2d. Chicago is roughly three times
Ihe size of Sydney, and Illinois has three
times the population of N. S. Wales. The
“Statesman’s Year-Book” gives the num-
ber of cattle in Illinois as 2,401,000,
whereas N. S. Wales has three million.
If milk can be sold at 6} cents a
“wine” quart in Chicago, 7d. a quart in
Sydney is legalised robbery.

“Reliability Before Speed.”
Hudson Fysh lectured in Sydney the
other day on the proposed London-
Australia air service, and sought to
justify the 17-day schedule. He is a
director of a co. which has advised the
Commonwealth Government, so he had
to justify it.
According to Mr. Fysh, what is aimed
at is “reliability before speed.” There
are other excuses —such as “lots of stops
on the way.” Why there should be lots
of stops on an expensive express service
no man knoweth. If they are actually
made most of them will be in Qantas ter-
ritory, thus giving back-country Queens-
land a service subsidised on an Imperial
basis. Perhaps the Qantas people deserve
it, seeing that they pioneered rural
aviation in Queensland, but it will be
hard on country through which the
service does not pass. The Civil Aviation
Department, however, does not suggest
that there will be lots of stops.
Mr. Fysh’s figures, in any case, don’t
hold water. He calls the service a 15-
day service to Sydney, but the Civil
Aviation Department says explicitly that
it is to be a “16-17 day service to Coota-
mundra.” He scouts, as an exaggera-
tion, statements about the 200-m.p.h.
services. It is definite that they are being
inaugurated in U.S.A. The timetable
which he approves from Singapore to
Sydney he places at 5 days 23 hours to
cover 4300 miles. The timetable which
the Los Angeles-Kansas City-N.Y. ser-
vice has found too slow is 19 hours
(daily) for 2567 miles. Even at that rate
the Singapore-Sydney route should be
covered in 30 hours ; and, if it is argued
that part of the service is overseas and
through monsoon weather, it must be
remembered that the Americans cross the
Rocky Mountains and regions where
there are winter blizzards and the tem-
perature gets down to 40 below zero
occasionally.
The Dutch service to Batavia, which
is being discarded because of its sloth,
is 164 m.p.d. faster than the proposed
Singapore-Sydney service, and over a
much longer distance. Paris-Saigon is
200 m.p.d. faster.
What Mr. Fysh and his friends pro-
pose to do is to traverse in six days one-
third of the London-Sydney route which
Ulm and his crew traversed in six days
17 hours in a machine which every big
mail service in the world would consider
to be out of date.

Big Things.
A chromium-plated effigy of Lenin,
180 feet high, is shortly to be hoisted to
the top of the 800-foot Palace of the
Soviets at Moscow. It is natural that a
new young civilisation —the U.S.S.R. is
a new kind of civilisation —should have
a craving for the Big. In the ardor of
its adolescence America went the same
way. It talked big, it built big and it
thought big. It acquired an enormous
idol for New York Harbor and called it
Liberty, though there is probably less
liberty in the U.S.A. than there is in
Europe.
Now the Americans have discovered
that they have built their country so big
that they can’t take it all in at one glance.
If they could they would find that they
built it in bits, and portions of the ana-
tomy are out of proportion in relation
to other parts. For instance, they have
a huge productive system capable of sup-
plying every man, woman and child with
a higher standard of living at a lower
expenditure of work, yet they have 10
million unemployed. They built the
production limb well and strong and left
the consumption limb to look after itself,
and it has withered through envy and
disappointment.
The people who made the Russian
Revolution were struck by the Big
Things they saw in America, and started
to build big themselves. They have a
big army, a big air force, a big statue
of Lenin, a big foreign debt and a grow-
ing internal one ; and they have a bright
prospect of having a big war with Japan.

Parkhill’s Greek Gift.
Concessions to telephone subscribers repre-
senting a loss of revenue of more than £40,000
were announced by the P.M.G. (Mr. Parkhill)
on Wednesday.
That is how it appeared in the daily
newspapers, and “S. M. Herald” indulged
in headlines which suggested that any
concession from the telephone branch —
which refuses to render its customers
details of accounts except under pressure
and at high cost, and which fines a house-
holder ss. 3d. if he happens to be away
on holiday when his bill comes in and he
does not pay six months’ rent in advance
on 14 days’ notice —should be thankfully
received. Generosity in an ordinary con-
cern and generosity in one which cuts off
its ’phones as a method of settling all dis-
putes and charges its victims rent while
they are prevented from using the in-
struments may be two different things.
Concessions are at any rate. Con-
sider Mr. Parkhill’s surrender of re-
venue : —•
In conjunction with the reduction of the
annual rental by £l, it is proposed that the
fee for the first 960 calls be decreased from
Hd. to lid., and that a charge of lfd. a call
be imposed for calls during the remainder of
the same year The revised arrangement
will benefit 70,000 subscribers who make fewer
than 960 calls annually.
And consider how it works out for any-
body who makes 960 calls in the year,
2.6 per day:
Old Rates. New Rates.
Rent .. £5 10 0 £4 10 0
Calls .. 5 0 0 6 0 0
Totals .. £lO 10 0 £lO 10 0
Still, any frugal householder who limits
himself to one call per day will save
a whole 2.8 d. per week. This, it is con-
fidently expected, will induce thou-
sands of the ’phoneless to rush to the
G.P.O. and fill in an order for one of
the obsolete instruments with which the
branch is overstocked.
It is proposed to form a Telephone
Development Association. What is needed
more is a Telephone-users’ Association
which would vet the department’s rates
and scrutinise and expose its monstrous
accumulation of regulations, some of
which, a barrister assures The Bulletin,
would be laughed out of the High Court.
*
Shipping Subsidies.
The Commonwealth Government still
wrestles with the question of shipping
competition in the Pacific, but, although
the matter has been a live one since the
advent of the big, heavily-subsidised
Matson liners, it seems to get no further.
It has asked the Maoriland Government
to co-operate, and has had conversations
with a representative of the U.S.A.
Meanwhile the Americans get the traffic,
and Washington carries the baby to the
tune of about 125,000 dollars of subsidy
for every 81b. of mail carried.
Subsidies are matters of discussion the
world over, and it is significant that some
of the smallest countries with the biggest
shipping businesses manage to carry on
without them. At the London Economic
Conference the delegations of Norway,
which owns 4000 vessels of 2,500,000 net
tons and has gross earnings from
foreign traffic of about £20,000,000 ster-
ling p.a., and of Holland proposed the
abolition at the earliest possible moment
of all shipping and shipbuilding subsi-
dies except those necessary to national
communications and the promotion of
trades vital to the State concerned.
The proposers argued that,
in view of the disastrous loss of equilibrium
between world tonnage and world traffic which
has resulted from a policy of subsidies, the only
alternative to the re-establishment of the in-
dustry on an economic basis must be a grant
of more subsidies.
And so, of course, round the vicious
circle.
Non-competitive services, the pro-
posers of abolition added, could not
satisfy the demands of international
trade, to which indeed they created a
“formidable barrier.”
The United Kingdom delegates backed
the viewpoint of the smaller countries,
remarking that the bounty system would
presently “deprive international trade of
the most efficient and cheapest sea trans-
port.” But the U.S.A. representatives
stood out for subsidies, and said their
country would permit no interference
with its policy.
If Norway can maintain its shipping
by sticking mainly to the fast, econo-
mical 10,000-tonners, other countries
ought to be able to do the same, Aus-
tralia included. Australia has an advant-
age over Norway that it has a regular
seasonal tide of primary-produce cargo
which might be carried in its own bot-
toms. As things go, however, Australia
not only has no overseas ships of her
own, but it is allowing foreigners to push
British shipping out of its trade. And
if there is one vital essential to Aus-
tralian defence in case of sudden emer-
gency it is to have an adequate number
of British ships in the merchant-cruiser
class in the Pacific handy to our coasts.

Retaining Walls.
When the doting children of some
Queenslanders ask their parents as they
sit at night conning the lottery lists:
Daddy, what did you do in the Great Depres-
sion?
the answer will come pat:
My son, I built retaining walls.
Retaining walls, as the report of the
Queensland Under-Sec. for Labor and
Industry just issued testifies, are the great
stand-by with Mr. Hynes, the Minister,
and his merry men. They have built
miles of them feet high along the Sand-
gate waterfront, where the landscape has
done without them for about a million
years—the water trickles up to the shore
there over the flats about an inch and a
half deep. They have built them yards
high in other seaside places near Bris-
bane, and when they have got tired of
walls they have resorted to footpaths.
Mr. Hynes’s own admirers in Towns-
ville did better than any others in the
expenditure of intermittent relief money.
Rockhampton and Ipswich, which are
pleasingly loyal to the Forgan Smiths,
were not forgotten—these three cities had
66 per cent, of the “intermittent” vote
and Mackay had a nibble at the balance.
During the year the Unemployment
Fund spent £1,771,000 out of a total of
£1,806,000 collected, but, as its income
has grown from £700,000 in 1930-31, the
Minister’s pride in his surplus seems
scarcely justified.
Queenslanders were taxed about £3
10s. per elector for unemployed-relief,
and most of the money went into
non-productive work. As the average
of unemployed persons was about 36,000
during the year, it works out at about
£5O per average head. If this had been
lent to private landowners to improve
their properties or cut off taxation to
give industry a chance, the results might
have been salutary. The Lands Depart-
ment did succeed one year in getting a
quarter of a million or so for the former
purpose, and, as experience shows, it pro-
vided work for 11,000 men and most of
the money is being paid back.; This,
however, was not true socialism, and the
Ministry stopped it. Instead it enabled
Brisbane aldermen to build 58 miles of
new streetway, 35 miles of concrete water
channel and acquire new park improve-
ments, other towns sharing in proportion.
However, the printers and the P.M.G.
did well —documents, stationery and
stamps came to nearly £BOOO in this small
department during the year.
The Beef Industry.
The beef industry is all-important to
north-west Queensland, so the Forgan
Smith Government has appointed a com-
mittee to solve its problems. It is the
Australian politician’s way. The chair-
man of the Meat Industry Board is a
member, but he is subordinated to a pro-
fessor of economics, who may know B
from a bull’s foot. Then there are three
members nominated by the Graziers’
Association. The übiquitous civil ser-
vant, of course, is there.
The committee will get nowhere. The
experienced members could tell the Gov-
ernment in ten minutes what it wants
to know. These are the essentials: —:
Encourage the breeders to mature their stock
at 18 months instead of five years. Breed an
even beast, so that carcasses may be standard-
ised. Away with the grass-fed animal and let
us have the corn-topped youngster full of bloom
and bred from the best Scotch and Scotch-
mated bulls that money can buy.
Breed with an eye on the British market. The
ideal of the British buyer is British beef; there-
fore, if we are to succeed it must be made easy
for breeders to import a continuous stream of
British bulls to imitate British carcass standards.
Remember that it isn’t so much a matter of
quality—we can produce that even from cattle
lines which have been in the country a cen-
tury—as economical meat type of the conforma-
tion and size which suit the British buyer.
A carcass is just as much crop as a bag of
wheat. The same profit factors operate in the
meat business as in growing grain. The more
wheat you raise on an acre at a minimum cost
for labor and fertilisers, the bigger the profit. >
The more choice meat he can pack on a steer
in a minimum time, the richer the meat-pro-
ducer will be.
Better bulls are the keynote of improvement.
Every scrub bull in the country should be
wiped out within five years. The scrubber is as
dangerous to the prosperity of the meat-raiser as
the prickly-pear is to the farmer, or the burr
to the sheepman. Compulsion would need to be
only partial—special reduction of taxation and
rent rebates should be made to the small man
who buys first-class Scotch sires of the right
type.
Lastly, quick transport is an asset. Argentina
has sent its meat to Britain in 19 days, chilled;
ours has gone, frozen, in 45. It is idle to say
that 45 is still all right because of the new
chilling processes. There is a time factor in
freight costs as well as in steer-raising costs.
A basic need in national beef export trade is
direct, fast-steamer service from North Aus-
tralia, landing meat in London in three weeks.
Let Forgan Smith grip these facts and
the commission may save its brains and
breath.
A Devouring Element.
“El V.”: “S. M. Herald” has given a
contributor a slab of its most sacred
page to propound a scheme for raising
an aboriginal army to defend the North
against the foreign foe. He says that in
three generations Binghi can be educated
to do most of the things which any white
does ; and there are possibilities in the
scheme.
Binghi, of course, could never be de-
pended on to fight. Most abo. wars boil
down to a lot of howling, terrific cam-
paigns of decoration and individual
spear-throwing; when a few people
get accidentally hit and killed Binghi goes
home sheepishly to talk about it loudly
for six weeks on end. It is true that as
a black policeman he proved himself a
good shot sometimes, but if it had not
been for his tracking ability he would
not have been much in vogue. He didn’t
mind shooting a few times, but he pre-
ferred to do it with long intervals of in-
ertia and food in between.
My proposal is that when the black
has been enlisted in the First Division of
Mataranka Terribles he should be asked
not to fight but to eat. In the Palmer
days, no Chinaman was safe when Binghi
was about. Urquhart, in command of
the Black Police, once lost his Chinese
cook and found but two of his feet boil-
ing in his own billycan, with his own
sweet potatoes for flavoring. If all the
inhabitants of Arnhem Land could have
their chewing gifts trained they would
be an asset were the Territory invaded.
Forty-five thousand stealthy abos. with
wives and children should be able to
account for one invader per family per
day. As an enemy who came by Darwin
to attack civilisation in the South would
be at least three months or so on the track,
4,050,000 would be accounted for in
90 nocturnal sneaks by our dark and
gallant army. But care would have
to be taken in choosing white com-
manders. People like Bull Ryrie are too
succulent to be trusted out at night with
a cannibal army. Billy Hughes would be
a success. No cannibal would imagine
that he was comestible, even in the dark.

“AMD IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS”
“Kaloa”: The Lord Mayor of Lon-
don’s kindly offer to reciprocate for our
gift of 8000 Christmas lambs with a pre-
sent of 8000 young Englishmen sounds
as if he has been reading the latest com-
munique from Arnhem Land, in the
nether parts of which his bounty would
be appreciated. Possibly the local
inhabitant would prefer 8000 young
“Your wife’s telling everybody you can’t keep her in clothes.”
“That’s nothing! Bought the hussy a home and can’t keep her in that.”
Chinamen, but I should say the English-
men would win easily if they were early-
matured at Eton, grazed in the older uni-
versities and topped off in the West End.
A bit of propaganda among the abori-
ginals, whom some of the English people
believe to constitute 90 p.c. of the Aus-
tralian population, on “Buy British” lines,
with historical publicity (“Harpagus ate
his son and liked him.... why not
you?”) and allusive window signs (“Best
Oxford Fellow stocked here —better than
Chow dog which the Cantonese adore”),
would help to dispose of the gift. It
would lend to the new commodity the
same sort of exotic air which leads Lon-
doners to buy Paris models and go
to the Riviera for the winter instead of
to Falmouth.

“Binduli”: Prof. Heinze, of Melb. Con.,
says the most talented and brilliant musi-
cal students in Australia come from Kal-
goorlie, which ought to please the West-
ralian goldfields capital. He suggests, as
a reason, that the youthful Kalgoorlieite
has less to attract him outside his home
than the children of cities where amuse-
ments are more readily found, and hence
are thrown back upon music, a proposi-
tion that won’t be nearly as pleasing
and indeed is quite untenable.. Haven’t
the mining fields of Australia always ex-
celled in music? And is there any need to
look for an explanation beyond the fact
that the Welsh and Cornish element has
always been stronger there than else-
where and that the Celts are one of the
most musical of races? Mining towns have
mostly supplied the best bands as well
as individual instrumentalists, and in
the main they continue to do so. Kal-
goorlie, by the way, has already pro-
duced a world champion at billiards;
Professor Heinze’s theory might perhaps
have some application in his case.

“Avon”: “Tamornie’s” criticism (B.
22/11/’33) of Rod Quinn’s description
of the sound of distant surf as “low, in-
sistent and ever-even” doesn’t apply.
“Tamornie” refers to the rhythmic varia-
tion of breakers —a big one every seventh
or ninth time —but has he never noticed
that on various parts of a long beach
the sequences are not synchronous? At
a distance of two or three miles the sound
is perfectly even, as Quinn describes it.
I lived for 40 years within three miles of
a long beach that fringes the eastern
coast of M.L. and can testify that when
the surf could be heard —which wasn’t
very often —it was a constant, even
murmur.

“Cauboy”: Fact is always stranger
than fiction. In a movie released in Mel-
bourne, a gangster cornered by armed
villagers makes his way to his armored
car by holding the heroine as a shield
in front of him. A recent cable from
Minneapolis relates that 12 bandits in-
vaded the town of Racing and robbed a
bank of £BOOO. Before they had finished
the job a large crowd had gathered, and
the police were pointing artillery from
every window in the surrounding build-
ings. Selecting three girl employees, the
thugs marched out of the bank with this
flesh screen before them and regained
their vehicles. In the screen story, of
course, the hero plunked the crook over
the girl’s shoulder, but in the Racing
incident the gang got away and didn’t
even marry the girls in gratitude. They
dumped them on the roadside 40 miles
out of the township,

“Cendre”: Since the last Armistice ser-
vice in Sydney there have been many
complaints about the polished condition
of the bronze statues in Martin-place. It
recalls the experience of an artist cobber
of mine. Touring Europe after the war
he picked up a beautiful miniature of
Cellini’s “Perseus.” It had that grey-
green patina which is the sure sign of a
fairly old work, and he treasured it grate-
fully. Returning to Australia he became
engaged, and for a wedding gift presented
“It’s no good, George—l won T quarre!
with you till after Christmas.”
his bride with his precious statuette. After
the ceremony he surveyed the array of
presents and came close to fainting. His
statuette was well to the front, but had
been assiduously polished by his bride’s
family and friends to the tint of a new
penny.

“Eureka”: Some of these competitions
conducted in the name of charity strike
me as the limit. Recently I entered
for a jumbled-letter contest, the entrance
fee being sixpence and the prize-money
£25. After considerable delay I received
a circular stating that 7600
competitors had succeeded,
and as the money could not
be divided I might (1) send
a stamped envelope for the
refund of my sixpence, or (2)
give it to the hospital. As
it would have cost me four-
pence in stamps to get my
sixpence refunded I took the
latter alternative, and so, I
suppose, did most of the
others. It seems a good safe
method of collecting money
for hospitals.

“Bunyip”: Manufacturers
of corsets and other devices
for decreasing feminine girth
have turned their attention to
the opposite sex. An adver-
tisement in an English paper
is headed, “Do not let your
middle age,” and goes on to
emphasise that years have
very little to do with it.
“Slim muscles taut you
are young. Fatly curved,
sagging—you are old,” and
so on. One features success-
ful business men eyeing the
waistbands of their trousers
and dashing out for one of
these reducing garments,
from 355. (standard model)
to six guineas (de luxe).
To take 10 years or so off your age by
some kind of belt as effective as a beauty
cream may be an attraction to many,
but I suggest it would rob the world of
much of its beauty to remove from our
streets and homes that happy, contented,
* well-fed air that a gently undulating
waistcoat gives.

“Bumpkin”: Two events in Melbourne
on the same day—the tennis champion-
ships and Henley—inspire thoughts on
the Australian temperament. The Eng-
lish tennis players all show degrees of
vivacity ; Lee indulges in transports of
gloom and jubilation, Perry hops about,
metaphorically pats himself on the back
and occasionally allows himself a bit of
slapstick. Similarly we have had Ameri-
cans here whose stuff on the courts would
make a good comedy short, and Borotra,
the Basque, was as tempestuous as
Wilkie’s Macbeth. But Crawford and
Hopman are as imperturbable as Chinese
idols. Although Crawford looks a decid-
edly nervous type, he allows himself not
the slightest outlet for his emotions. Much
the same gravity was a feature of the
Henley show. Thousands of girls paraded
up and down the lawns and I looked in
the faces of some of them. They were
preternaturally solemn, as if they were
engaged in a sacred rite, as indeed they
were —the exhibition of their sartorial
skill. Some of them were acutely con-
scious of the fact that they were fashion
innovators in trousers or short pants. A
few young men in straw hats instead of
Akubras also felt the eyes of the world
were on them. Nobody looked at the
aquatic events and nobody laughed or
sang or threw up his bonnet or behaved
like a carefree kid. The most exciting
spectacle of an unofficial sort provided
was that of two unemployed youths in
rags. One crooned a lugubrious ditty
about having been crossed in love while
the other passed round a battered hat and
explained that he was the sole support of
a stricken mother. If the centenary com-
mittee want to give visitors an impression
that Melbourne is not celebrating its own
funeral it ought to start right now re-
hearsing a couple of hundred unemployed
actors in spontaneous jollity and unpre-
meditated bliss. They could be placed at
strategic points at all functions requiring
an emotional element.

“Belar Stump”: Touching poor Hugo
Throssell, V.C., the regimental poet
who wrote “And though we got it in the
Nek” (B. 22/11/’33) was not Olden, of
the 10th L.H., but Lieut. Gates, of the
3rd L.H.B.T. The verses were written
at Heliopolis racecourse camp in Novem-
ber, 1915, in response to an appeal for a
brigade song to the tune of “Marching
Through Georgia.” The prize was one
guinea. The play on the word “Nek”
was quite unintentional on the part of
Gates, as in his entry he spelt it “neck.”
I was one of the judges ; the other two
were Captain Gibbs, afterwards killed on
the Menin-road, and Elliot Murray, also
deceased.

“Wagga”: An old journal which I
came across the other day referred to
a visit from the first Anglican Bishop of
Australia and mentioned that the bishop’s
registrar had presented to the Church of
St. John the Baptist, Sydney, a “sera-
phine.” The word sent me to the diction-
ary, where I discovered that a seraphine
was a musical instrument of the har-
monium type, invented in 1833 and im-
proved upon in 1841. I can’t help won-
dering what has become of that parti-
cular seraphine.
THE SEDENTARY SNIFTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“In New York State, when Prohibition ends, drinks
in saloons will have to be taken sitting; standing at
bars, it has been decided, makes it too easy to
‘have another.’ ”
Who gulps his grog uprightly
Will find, as like as not,
He’ll all too soon be slightly
Or noticeably shot.
Less chance of misadventure
And its attendant censure
Waits on the resting quencher,
The sedentary tot.
Back to the thirsty Yankee
Comes Bacchus in his car,
With spirits, wines and swanky
In bottle, cask and jar,
In barrels and in cases.
Old Time his steps retraces,
Save that, in certain places,
One may not breast the bar.
His elbow may not polish
Grained oak or marble pale,
Where he was wont demolish
In days of old his ale;
His cherished right it will be
No more to sip his Gilbey
Or Scotch with careless trilby
Upon the shining rail.
To bootleggers beholden
No whit, henceforth he’ll drowr
His cares in wine that’s golden
Or beer that’s bravely brown;
And fear no perils looming
Ahead, or coppers fuming
Around —that is, assuming
He sinks it sitting down.
When once securely anchored
To table and to chair,
New York may drain the tankard
Or nip the highball rare,
But not round counters milling—
The game becomes too willing,
The pace a bit too killing,
It’s estimated, there.
The demon in the flagon
He challenged, Uncle did;
He fought in vain the dragon
That in the bowl is hid.
Experience for his tutor,
He’s hit on ways acuter
To keep in bounds the pewter
And circumvent the tid.
He rules it more befitting
The human brotherhood
Should take its liquor sitting,
From bottle or from wood.
Here’s wisdom warrants handing
Around and worth expanding:
The more men tipple standing,
The faster drinks are stood.

T. THE R.


“Hamer”: When legal drinking is
resumed in the U.S.A., it will be subject
to a medley of regulations passed by
various States. In lowa, for instance,
drinking licenses will be issued, which
can be cancelled or suspended if the
owner exceeds the speed limit. There
will be drinkers, of course, without
licenses ; but they and the people who
serve them will take a risk. Perhaps it
won’t be much of a risk, though, judg-
ing from Australia’s experience with
prohibition orders. One was issued
against a literary figure in Sydney
and resulted in his most irrigated
period. Sympathetic friends used to
invite him to wait in some side lane
whilst they brought beer to him from an
adjacent hotel. Even when he had a
tendency to decline, the invitation was
pressing. “I wish,” said the poet at last,
“that this prohibition order would run
out, so that a man would have a chance
to get sober!”

“R.M.O. 35th”: The par. about Mel-
bourne gutters running champagne (B.
15/11/’33) reminds me that I once saw
the same happening in France. In Vil-
lers Bretonneux on April 4, 1918, there
was a store stacked to the roof with the

exhilarating wine. Fifth Army men
had got at it, and it was thought
our fellows should not be subjected
to the same temptation. So the
j or( iered it to be broken up.
And many a heart grew sad that day
That so much good liquor was thrown
away.” Truth compels me to add, how-
ever, that I managed to Salvage four
cases before the axe fell, and many a
WOU nded Digger passed On from my aid
post that day with a glass of champagne
inside him as well as a dose of morphia
under his skin.

“Oxmead”: In justice to aggrieved
members of Parliament it has to be ad-
mitted that the nature of running com-
ment from the press gallery has altered
more in the last few years than in the
preceding 70. I think H. W. Lucy (as
“Punch’s” “Toby, M.P.”) was the founder
? f *5 Practice of describing Parliamen-
tary doings and sayings m a sprightly,
flippant, jocular style. He poked fun at
Ministers and members, but it was mild,
almost affectionate, fun that nobody
could take offence at. He fastened nick-
names on to them, but they were always

matter of taste, I suppose, but the change
f ro m the old style to the new has been
effected with almost startling sudden-
ness‘ * * * *
“Slushy”: The Imperial Navy is to try
a new me thod of preparing meals. To
date t^e CU stom has been to have separate
galleys for the lower dec k, the warrants’
mess an d the gun- and wardrooms—the
old Man, of course, eats in splendid iso-
]ation. The new scheme introduces a
g enera [ messing system, the meals
j n a ]j cases being identical. As far as
j ssue rations are concerned the plan
should work well But all the mess es,
f rom the wardroom downwards, are
accustomed to add to the regulation

pockets, as is also the case in the Army,
There is likely to be trouble if, say, the

room find their way to the stokers’ mess,
or t h e railway duff—a raisin at every
stat ion along the line—is served up to
the indignant snotties and other inhabi-
tants of the gunroom. I am of the
opinion that such tragedies are not un-
likely—that is, if naval cooks have any-
thing in common with the Army variety,
* * * *
“Ex-P.8.1.”: My experience of battle-
noises is that bullets which pass quite
close to the head invariably make a dis-
tinct “crack” in the air, whereas “whizz-
spits” are well off the target. Another
thing I noted was that when a bullet
fired from fairly close range (under 400
yards) hit a man the noise of the impact
was very similar to that made by a solid
body-punch. “Hamer” (B. 15/11/’33)
didn’t mention the most terrifying war-
noise of all—the last split-second scream
of a five-nine as it lobbed almost on
you. The ear-splitting crash of the ex-
plosion didn’t matter, if you were as
close to it as that. Gas shells passing
overhead had a peculiar sort of jerky
“Didn’t she marry a big wool man?”
“No —only a black sheep.”
sound, almost as if they were progress-
ing in a series of spasmodic leaps.
Troops that bivouacked in the open fields
round Dickebusch in the summer of ’l7
will remember another unpleasant sound
—the “eugh-ee-eugh-ee” of Fritz’s “grass-
cutter” aerial bombs.
* * . * *
“St. Silene”: A once-popular conven-
tion among the scatterbrained was
’ecalled when two youths appeared
in a Sydney police court
charged with pretending to
be drunk. The arresting Hon
said that he had come on
them in a suburban street
late at night apparently hope-
lessly “shot” and going
going through all the motions,
including singing raucously
and the carrying of a cray.
Closer inspection showed the
pair were stone-sober, and
the constable, indignant at
having been so mercilessly
hoaxed, carried out the joke
to its logical conclusion—in this case
10s. or “the rising.”
* * * *
“Torts”: Comment was made in the
Sydney Divorce Court on the careless
drawing up of an affidavit from West-
ralia; a certificate of judgment from
the same source was stigmatised as
“a very curious affair.” “They should
see the affidavits prepared in our
courts,” remarked ’Sonah severely. It
would be strange if there weren’t some
difference. In N. S. Wales, as in most
States, a solicitor is a solicitor and a
barrister a barrister, whereas in Westralia
the same man has to be both. A
few years ago a Westralian lawyer (he
subsequently became Attorney-General)
on a visit to Sydney remarked to the
writer that the clean-cut difference
between the two branches of the profes-
sion was a great advantage for both and
their clients as well; in his own State a
man might have to turn from a bit of
conveyancing to argue a case in court.
It is little wonder if legal documents
drawn up in Perth occasonally fall short
of the Sydney standard.
* * * *
“El V.”: Last week a small boy
was found by the police in Sydney with
a fully-loaded revolver and an avowed
ambition to become a gunman, and the
usual erudite person has risen to say that
a “more intensive psychological training
to direct the moral thought of delinquent
juveniles is needed.” I quite agree. I
am not a gunman, because I had a course
of education which taught me the dis-
advantages of both sloth and crime. The
professor who operated on my mind
( et al .) was my male parent, an ex-Innis-
killing Dragoon, six feet high, with a
twelve-foot reach when he had a dog-
whip in his hand. His methods were
objective, and the marks of the lessons
which he taught me—when, for instance,
I stole a box of gelignite to ease the
labor of firewood-getting which filled
too much of my Saturdays—are still with
me, though I may not contemplate them.
The memento of the happy inspiration
which led me to put a half-frozen carpet
snake in the teacher’s desk is, however,
more available. I suppose I should have
been brutalised by the old gentleman’s
attentions, but I don’t think I was, and
I certainly have what most of these
softly-bred psychologised youngsters
have not —a distinctly traceable record
behind me and some vivid memories.

“Cubberlie”: Nelson did leave an un-
finished letter to Lady Hamilton, and
it may have found its way to M.L. (B.
29 /11 / ’33). The following extract is
from “Nelson’s Hardy,” by Broadley and
Bartelot:
It was apparently Hardy’s task to convey to
Lady Hamilton the incomplete letter begun by
Nelson before the commencement of the battle.
It is endorsed in her handwriting: “This letter
was found open on his desk and brought to
Lady Hamilton by Captain Hardy.”
Evidently the authors had seen the letter,
but it is not stated where. The book was
published in 1909.
* * * *
“Selma”: Some years ago, when the
only daughter of the wealthiest people
in our unfashionable subbub was to be
married, her doting parents took the local
hall and invited our social lights to a
splendid feast. Unfortunately, when the
company arrived at the hall the elaborate
supper, all arranged and set with decora-
tions, was a scene of devastation. The
ruin had extended to the dance-floor,
over which were strewn portions of fruit-
salad and trifle, varied by patches of
salad and blobs of jelly. The place was
so uninhabitable that the company turned
regretfully away and sought the pictures,
while a hysterical damsel was led home
by her groom-to-be and given two
aspirins and a whisky to soothe her
nerves. No trace of the miscreants was
discoverable, and the affair became a vil-
lage legend. It remained so until re-
cently, when a matron whose name had
been omitted from the invitation list was
arranging a festal gathering for her en-
gaged daughter, and the girl, stirred by old
memories, revealed that she and her twin
brother had been responsible for the
famous upheaval. Goaded by their
mother’s disappointment they had
clambered in through a tiny unfastened
window, and ten minutes’ self-expression
did the rest. The confession was kept a
family secret.

POLITICA L POINTS
It looks as if Roosevelt is paying too
high a price for higher prices.
The world is becoming more and more
interdependent. In matters of trade and
commerce no country can now afford to
act regardless of its relations with another.
When Britain went off gold, the French
put a 15 p.c. surtax on British goods.
They were recently notified that unless
they took it off the Old Man would re-
taliate. It is to be taken off.
From the “Argus” of November 30:
The House of Representatives is the predomi-
nant partner, no matter what the Constitution
may say.
And that very day “the predominant
partner” yielded to the “requests” of the
Senate for lower duties on dates, spray
pumps and rabbit traps—in spite of
Tariff Board recommendations, as Forde
pointed out. Latham pleaded that, if the
House tried to assert its alleged pre-
dominance, the Senate might “continue
indefinitely to press its requests.” On
this point, as on so many others, the
blessed Constitution is as clear as mud.
B. B. O’Conor, the veteran Chairman
of Committees, is one of the 15 six-year
men who will go into the N.S.W. Leg.
Council as a result of the third ballot,
unless a protest against the rejection of
one of the informal votes (14 this time)
is upheld. But Ryan, the Honorary Min-
ister, again failed of election, though
Donald Grant, of I.W.W. notoriety,
squeezed in. The chucking-out of Ryan
and the chucking-in of Grant are two
more nails in the coffin of election of
members by members; and Stevens
must now wish he had never heard of
the blessed thing.
Collings, the Queensland Senator, was
moved to wrath last Thursday by what
he described as “the most disgraceful
thing that has happened in Parliament of
recent months.” The salary grab? No :
The small number of Senators present this
evening. Over and over again the bells were
rung for a quorum. It shows there are Sena-
tors utterly impervious to the needs of the
country.
But they were nearly all on hand when
the grab was put to the vote. There
were 19 ayes and 9 noes, and six paired,
leaving only two unaccounted for; one
—Kingsmilf—was away ill. So there are
Senators who are not “impervious” to
their own “needs.”
The final patchwork plan to aid wheat-
growers makes one long for a Prime
Minister with the gift of swift decision.
There is to be a flour tax of £4 ss. a ton,
estimated to yield £1,600,000 by next
June ; another £1,400,000 is to be raised
by increasing the import duty on tobacco
and by repudiating portion of the
income-tax reductions granted in the
Budget. If Lyons had tackled the ques-
tion two months ago, when it should
have been handled, flour tax at £4 ss.
would have yielded at least £2,000,000
instead of the sum now anticipated ; and
if he had made it £6 ss. instead of £4 ss.
it would have produced the £3,000,000
which he believes to be required without
resort to other sources. But Niggle
and Giggle seem to be the un-Homeric
gods of Australian politics.
Westralia’s Leg. Council jibbed on
constitutional grounds at the measure
shielding Clydesdale, M.L.C., who was
held to have rendered himself liable to
forfeiture of his seat and substantial
penalties by accepting a salaried post on
the Lotteries Commission. The Govern-
ment came back with another bill amend-
mg the Constitution to admit of Clydes-
dale and any other member, Councillor
or Assemblyman, taking and holding any
such office of profit under the Crown.
When it comes to increasing the privi-
leges of politicians, Labor and National-
ist are very much alike.
N. S. Wales Taxation Department
seems to be dogged by the shadow of
Lang. Eighteen months ago Labor’s
Greatest Leader had a band of sturdy
fellows, hired at £6 a week, guarding its
portals in Warwick House. Now it has
moved into Lang’s Monument, which, in
turn, housed the Government Savings
Bank he shut and his lottery. It is a
fit building to collect taxes in. It cost
something like a rriillion (but what’s a
million?), and from the outside it looks
like a movie magnate’s dream.
Maoriland’s policy in regard to Upper
House reform seems to be to let the
institution gradually fade away. James
Parr’s acceptance of the High Commis-
sionership reduces the membership to 20.
Five members are due to retire next year,
and so long as the present Coalition Gov-
ernment remains in power reappoint-
ments and new appointments are likely
to be scarce. Since it arrived in 1931
ANOTHER PUNITIVE EXPEDITION.
“The San José lynching has sent a thrill of horror through the U.S.A. New York and
Chicago are especially indignant.”
“Say, bo, this kinda gets the Amurrican nation in wrong, besides musclin’ in on us.”
“You’ve said it, buddy. What about sendin ’ a gang o’ the boys to Cal. an’
puttin’ some of them buttinskys on the spot?”
the Chamber has lost 18 members by
death or retirement, and only three have
been reappointed.
Peace continues to rage everywhere.
Reports from China are to the effect that
civil war has started between the Nan-
king Government and Fukien —the south-
ern province from which large numbers
of coolies fare forth to Malaya and used
to fare forth to Australia. The new
revolution calls itself Social Democratic.
The Nanking Government is regarded
as bourgeois. Its war-lord, Chiang Kai-
shek, is somewhere in the vast interior
struggling desperately with Communists.
The Fukien business may bring Japan
into the picture. Formosa is a handy
stepping-stone, and Fukien has always
been regarded as a Jap “sphere of influ-
ence” —at any rate, in Tokio.
Vic. Leg. Assembly got itself properly
stirred up over the bill to prevent the
sale of liquor on Good Friday. Second
reading was postponed to allow the Gov-
ernment to consider a compensation-
clause amendment. After it had been
shown that the average profit of Vic.
hotels was £270 p.a. per publican, and
Tunnecliffe had pointed out that last
year Bung had contributed £729,937 to
State revenue, and the opinions of all the
archbishops had been aired, and the
amendment had been carried against the
Government, the measure was dropped.
So, as Attorney-General Menzies re-
marked, “The hotels will be open next
Good Friday.”
N.S.W.’s State lottery paid the hospi-
tals £820,000 in 1932-33 out of a total
revenue of £2,054,000. The public got
£1,304,100 back in prize-money. As
illustrating the casualness of the Austra-
lian inside and outside the lottery office,
£11,610 of unclaimed prize-money re-
mained in the kitty at the end of the
year, and £lB7 13s. 6d. had to be pro-
vided to replace bad coins palmed off on
the staff. Travelling expenses ran to £35.
Where does a lottery official travel to?
It is no use spending two millions on
bulk handling of wheat, as Victoria pro-
poses to do (though Argyle is not enthusi-
astic), unless there will be a clear saving
for the farmer. The attitude of wharf-
laborers and Arbitration Court Judges
renders this more than doubtful. In
Westralia, where a big co-operative
organisation has arranged for the financ-
ing of a bulk-handling scheme designed
to save the farmer 3d. a bushel, the
wharfies’ union is demanding a tax of at
least Id. a bushel to compensate mem-
bers who may lose their work ; and the
Labor Government is sympathetic. And
Beeby, J., has ruled that lumpers load-
ing wheat in bulk are entitled to addi-
tional pay. This he has fixed at 6d. an
hour for handling from silos at ports,
2|d. for stowing in holds and 4d. for
all other operations.
It was supposed that lynching in the
U.S.A. was restricted to southern States
and reserved for niggers, but California
has been the scene of a frightful case
in which two white men were the
victims. Awaiting trial for the murder
of a young man whose body was fished
out of San Francisco Bay, they fell into
the hands of a mob which, in spite of
guards and gas, stormed San Jose Gaol.
Then, the narrative says,
Their clothes were stripped from them, they
were beaten and kicked till every part of them
was tom and bleeding, ropes were put round
their necks, and they were hung from a near-
by tree, while men, women and children
howled with glee.
So even Californians can behave like
wild beasts when they have lost faith in
the administration of justice. Whatever
our political differences, we must never
let that happen in Australia.
Moroney, secretary of the Queensland
A.R.U., told the A.R.U. Council gather-
ing in Melbourne that Queensland un-
employed were better off under Moore
than they are under Forgan Smith ; and
that the same is true of the State railway-
men. So the Labor Government didn’t
order out the State band when Moroney
returned to Brisbane.
Australia paid £6,925,830 in war pen-
sions last year. The average fortnightly
allowance was 19s. 6d. per head ; admin-
istration of Repat. cost 2 p.c.-odd of pen-
sions paid. There are 269,810 pensioners
on the r 011—75,244 Diggers, 164,268 of
their dependants and 30,398 who lost
breadwinners in the war.
The A.I.F. has been modest in its
demands on the nation compared to the
U.S.A.’s G.A.R. Fourteen years after the
Civil War, with 242,000 pensioners, Uncle
Sam was paying out about as much as
Australia is at present; but by the time
the Spanish-American War broke out
soldier pensioners alone numbered
750,000, there were over 215,000
pensioner widows and payments
amounted to about £26,000,000 per
annum. Even to-day, 68 years after the
war, Sam has 39,426 Civil War veterans
and 153,000 war widows on his hands.
Maoriland’s Reserve Bank Bill was
passed by the Leg. Council without
amendment. The directorate is to con-
sist of the governor, the deputy-governor
(appointed for seven years) and five other
members. The five other members are
to be named by the Government in the
first instance. One retires each year,
commencing 1934, and all subsequent
appointments are to be made by vote
of the shareholders.
The best bit of political news of the
week in N. S. Wales is that the wages-
tax reductions have taken effect. Toilers
in the £2 to £2 10s. class found Is. 3d.
more in their pay envelopes on Friday
(or Saturday), and plutocrats with £lO
p.w. had a whole 2s. Bd. more. The
Government might have made it 2s. 9d.
—the price of half a State lottery ticket
got from an agent—while it was on the
job.
Trolley ’buses have arrived in Perth,
and local opinion is emphatic that they
are superior in every way to the noisy
and jerky old trams. London has a
trolley-’bus system which operates over
18 miles of routes in the south-western
suburbs, and a bill to provide for the
replacing of trams on 90 miles of routes
is on the stocks. Leaving out company
expenditure, it cost 25 millions to con-
struct Australian tramways. The time
is coming when most of the 25 millions
will have to be written off as a dead loss.
A G.P.O. regulation declares that de-
tails of the number of calls used by a
telephone subscriber may be supplied at
a cost of 6d. for each period not exceed-
ing one day, or Is. for the total daily calls
in any one month. The exaction in the
case of a man questioning an account
for 180 calls would amount to 31.5 p.c.
of the bill. Is there any other concern
in the world which charges its customers
for establishing its own honesty by send-
ing in an itemised bill when requested to
do so?

torical students. W. D. Forsyth is one of
them. Forsyth’s latest contribution to the
literature of early Australia is a book on
Governor Arthur’s Van Diemen’s Land
convict system, which has so impressed
Melbourne University and the Imperial
Studies Committee of the Royal Empire
Society that he has received substantial
grants from both to support the book’s
publication. He is a master at Sale (Vic.)
High School and a brother of Christopher
Forsyth, a Victorian Rhodes scholar now
at Oxford.
Frederick Waley, the coal knight who
died in Sydney last week, was a good
friend to Diggers and to a lot of other
people who needed one. During the war
he commanded the Naval Coal Transport
Battalion and controlled the Federal coal
stocks. In 1919 he and his wife gave
their home, Mowbray Park, at Picton as

friend to Diggers.
a permanent haven for shell-shocked and
permanently injured sailors and soldiers.
Also, he helped equip the Discovery
before Scott’s last dash to the South Pole.
Besides being a K.B. he was a member of
the Order of St. Olav (first class), a dis-
tinction which recognised his many years
service as Vice-Consul for Norway.
James Sherlock, a Sydney bookmaker
with an artistic soul, has won a film
competition with a 15-minute reel en-
titled “I Bequeath.” Early in the year
Sherlock read two sketches written by
Ralph Maynard in the “S. M. Herald”
and dramatised them so successfully that
a coveted prize comes to Australia.
S. Australia’s deputy P.M.G., E. P.
Ramsay, is held out to all as an example
of how one may rise in the service. He
started half a century ago as a messenger
in East Maitland (N.S.W.) at a salary of
£26 p.a., and hasn’t looked back since.
There’s very little of the continent he
doesn’t know either —he was relieving
officer in N.S.W. for three years, learnt
Victoria like a book as Melb. Supt. of
Mails, and travelled over Westralia when
he was deputy there. Ramsay reached the
E. P. RAMSAY, Deputy P.M.G. in
South Australia.
Torrens city in 1928 after a trip through
Centralia from Darwin. But he’s not a
postman all the time ; when in Sydney
a rather musical voice used to be in much
demand, and lately he’s been dividing his
time between a garden and —when a big
cricket match is on —the Adelaide Oval.
J. K. Small, who died in the Sydney
War Memorial Hospital suddenly last
week, was one of the hereditary aristocrats
of the printing trade. He was in the third
generation in the “S. M. Herald” office,
the family connection having existed for
75 years. There was one short and tur-
bulent interlude in his professional life
when he served as head of the old “D.T.”
composing-room during that paper’s ex-
piring years. A quiet, equable man, reli-
gious and kindly, he had friends scat-
tered among the cases in a hundred print-
ing offices throughout the Common-
wealth.
Poor C. D. Patterson, who was found
dead in his Seaforth (Sydney) home on
Saturday night with a gas-ring on his
chest, had done more for Sydney’s
beach-loving generation than any other
man. He was a member of the
Surf Life-Saving Commission appointed
by the N. S. Wales Government in
1910, when a bathing-suit was still
something between a tent and an
Arab’s blanket, and for 21 years as a
zealous chairman of the Surf Life-Saving
Association he organised the regiments
of succor on the big beaches which have
done so much to advertise Australian
manhood abroad. Latterly he had been
a sick man. He was Gordon and Gotch’s
advertising manager for 15 years.
Rev. T. C. Ewing, who labored in the
vineyard at Wollongong (N.S.W.) long
ago, had three remarkable sons. All
three went into public life —though not
as professional politicians—and made
good there. Tom was for 16 years a
Ma State Assemblyman, and for nine a
member of the House of Reps.; he was
in one of Deakin’s Ministries. Nor-
man went to Westralia, where he was
an Assemblyman and one of the original
Senators ; migrating to Tasmania, he be-
came Assemblyman, leader of the Oppo-
sition, Supreme Court Judge and
Administrator. John accompanied his
younger brother to Westralia,. where he
served in both Houses and reached
Cabinet rank under Mitchell. All three
are now dead ; John joined his brothers
in the Silent Land at Perth last week.
The death of J. S. Love at 71 leaves
a big gap in N.Q. life. He had seen most
of the cities of the North grow out of a
few casual shanties. Born at Stirling in
sight of the field of Bannockburn, he
came to Australia at 16 and almost at
once was taken by his relative, Dr.
Robert Logan Jack, on his journey of ex-
ploration through Cape York., Jack, in
his “Northmost Australia,” refers to
Love’s services and adventures more than
once. Afterwards, he went into pastoral
life, became a great station owner, a
judge of horses second to none and one
of the biggest exporters of wiry northern
nags to India. He was a well-known
racing man, took part in most worth-
while Townsville movements and had an
army of friends. He died on the Changte
as he sat quietly in a chair after lunch.
A. G. Berg, son of the late P. M.
Berg, has been appointed Aircraft Super-
intendent of the Civil Aviation branch. A
Croydon (N.Q.) native and B.G.S. boy,
passing on to Queensland Uni., where he
took his M.E. with honors. In 1927 he
joined the Brisbane City Council, but
left for the General Electric Co., Sche-
nectady, where he specialised in mechani-
cal engineering. He became assistant
engineer to Mohawk Aircraft Corpora-
tion in Minneapolis, designing light air-
craft. Proceeding to England, he joined
the Fairey Aviation Co. staff, where he
spent three years designing and manu-
facturing. He returned to Brisbane this
year, and was engaged with Snashall,
Anthon Pty., Ltd., in general engineer-
ing. He is an associate member of the
Royal Aero Society and I.E.A.

regatta in the face of the uncertainty of
the Melbourne weather no man deserves
more credit than organising sec. E.

dice that Melbourne’s waterway is a one-

in-two solution of dead cats. Kenny is
well known to the rowing men of two
States. He is an ex-member of the
Mosman (N.S.W.) and a life member of
the Leichhardt R. C.; he secretaries for
the Aust. Amateur Rowing Council and
at one time did the same for the Rowing
Association of N.S.W.
Harold Nelson is distinguished among
politicians —he has a salary like the rest
of them, but no vote in the Reps., where
he sits for the largest constituency in the
world, the Northern Territory. He has,
however, a voice, and since 1922, when he
was first elected, it has been heard almost
every week. He is a genial chap, bred a
union official but with kind thoughts for
HAROLD G. NELSON, the Northern
Territory’s voteless (but not voice-
less) member.
everybody who lives north of 22 south.
Sometimes his sympathy for the bush
people carries him away and he says more
than he means, but his adversaries always
forgive him. They know that he regards
Australia as a camel which he intends
to ride to the goal of N.T. prosperity,
and they understand very well that you
can’t drive the oont with soft words.
Vic. ex-Justice Schutt, who died after a
fall on a returning English liner, had pro-
bably more of the milk of human kind-
ness in him than most. It is generally
conceded that he resigned in 1926 be-
cause he didn’t want to repeat the ex-
perience of having to sentence a fellow-
countryman to death. Perhaps to brighten
a murky job he developed more than the
usual amount of forensic wit. A gent,
one once' remarked concerning a col-
league, “It’s a bald argument, y’Honor.”
“Not bald,” said Schutt, J., “airy.”
Senator Bob Elliott has Northcliffian
as well as other ambitions. He has long
been the active man behind the scenes
in the running of the “Sunraysia Daily,”
one of the De Garis Mildura ventures.
This gave him an entry into the Vic.
Provincial Daily Newspapers’ Assoc.,
which he now controls, and also a
powerful influence in Australian United
Press, both of which are linked in
the maintenance of news services for
city and country newspapers all over
Australia. Not long ago the long and
shrewd Senator picked up the Castle-
maine paper, and now he has secured
control of another at Shepparton. There
is, too, the matter of a Melbourne
weekly.
Percy Marks, who has just presented
Australia with a “national monument”
done in opal, has a mania for giving the
iridescent things away. Once he used to
make a gift of one or two to everybody
responsible who came into his shop, but
latterly public museums have benefited.
The Sydney Mines Museum has a col-
lection which he presented to it, and he
is giving others to the N.S.W. Techno-
logical Museum and the newly-opened
Armidale Museum. A dozen museums
or so in France also have received his
gifts—Paris, Bordeaux, Lyons, Lille,
Toulouse, Marseilles, Nancy, Nantes and
Strasbourg —in token whereof the French
Government has decorated him as an
officier de l’instruction publique.

Approximately half the business, which is
spread all over the Commonwealth and
Maoriland, is done in the bank’s home
State. Last term an expansion of
£2,374,096 in deposits and of £1,154,564
in bills payable was accompanied by a
growth of £2,881,247 in low-interest-bear-
ing deposits and a net addition of
£685,051 to advances. Borrowers on over-
draft were somewhat shy, but the im-
provement in the volume of business
handled, especially in the exchange
market, where the Wales does a large
turnover, was better than the movement
in advances suggests. Certainly the dis-
count rate for Treasury bills dropped
from 4 p.c. to 2\ p.c., and the charge for
overdrafts was lowered to a minimum 54-
p.c.—a 1 p.c. cut in the previous term left
the average rate at 6 p.c. or more. On
the other hand, the proportion of interest-
bearing deposits decreased, and, with
maturity of some of the old high-rate
contracts, the margin between borrow-
ing and lending rates moved more in
the bank’s favor. Also, the tax bill
(£289,038 = 3.2 p.c. on capital) was
£34,821 lighter.
Declared net earnings shrank £23,351,
due, apparently, to provision for con-
tingencies, leaving enough to show only
a trifle over 5 p.c. on the £8,780,000 of
capital as against 5.3, 7.5, 9.8, 13.3, 15.8
and 17.3 p.c. back to 1927. The £439,616
of profit was no more than 2.8 p.c. on
capital and visible reserves combined.
The div. was kept at 5 p.c., to which
figure it had been lowered early in 1932.
Until a little over two years ago the co.
had never paid less than 9 p.c. since the
old copartnery closed its existence in
1850.
Declaration of a lower profit surprised
the market, and the price of the £2O paid
shares, which had risen from £3O ss. a
year ago to £34 12s. 6d. early in
November, dropped to £32 last week.
The return at £32 is 3.1 p.c. on a 5 p.c.
div. basis ; thus the investor who looks
for 4.3 p.c. on his money counts on a
7 p.c. div., which would call for a wink
over 4 p.c. on total funds.

Absorption of the Australian Bank of
Commerce was mainly responsible for
movements in the 1932 figures, and, in-
cidentally, for a large addition to inner
reserves. The banking averages for Sep-
tember show that 72 p.c. of the co.’s
Australian deposits was interest-bearing
as against 73.1 p.c. a year earlier. Over
the 12 months to Sept. 30 the ratio of
advances to deposits fell from 76.8 p.c.
to 75.5 p.c., and the ratio of liquids to
liabilities rose from 42.3 p.c. to 43.8 p.c.

Of the shrinkage of £3,278,960 in
Treasury bills, which are mortgages upon
the future capital resources of a country,
£2,320,000 was in respect of Australian
paper, and the balance in respect of
London, where call money (up £1,730,000)
offered a low but slightly better return.
Most of the money which became avail-
able was put into Government securities,
up £4,009,025. The growth of £1,275,272
in bills receivable reflects brisker export
business.
The rise in the price of wool and tax
remissions should mean much to the co.,
which is well equipped and anxious to
extend its lending connections as oppor-
tunity offers.

Progress has become more definite. Cer-
tainly the amount of new business written
slipped £305,718 in the Industrial sec-
tion (£5,131,867), but it improved by
£1,200,063 in the Ordinary branch
(£6,381,585). Also, in the two depart-
ments combined, surrenders (£472,428)
were £150,831 lighter. Including Acci-
dent figures, the year’s net premiums
(£3,052,254) sprang £92,441, and interest
and rents (£840,986) were up £15,707;
the previous year’s figures showed con-
tractions of £13,079 and £110,121 re-
spectively. Outgoings (£2,516,188) were
£161,685 lighter. So, after striking
£50,000 off the book value of premises,
and sending a like amount to the
contingency reserve (now £475,854),
£1,277,052, as against £907,219 in the pre-
vious year, was added to the Life fund,
raising it to £18,689,965 at Sept. 30.
The surplus available for distribution
amongst policy-holders (£691,609) was
£11,469 better:
1930. 1931. 1932. 1933.
Net surplus:—
Ordinary .. £398,612 £389,768 £393,592 £400,640
Industrial .. 190,059 237,111 286,548 290,969
Total . . £588,671 £626,879 £680,140 £691,609
After reserving a further £50,000 for
contingencies, reversionary bonuses on
the same scale as for the previous term
are to be distributed. The office assumes
that its funds will earn a uniform 3 p.c.
After deducting taxes (£147,672, down
£32,495), the net return on mean funds
last year was £3 16s. lOd. as against
£3 16s. Id. for the previous one, and
recently announced remissions in taxation
will, when put into force, further widen
the margin available for policy-holders.
The most heartening feature of the
business is the development in the
Ordinary branch:

Excluding taxation, exes, got way with
17.4 p.c. of the year’s net premiums as
against 17.1, 18.8 and 19 p.c. for the
three preceding years.
In the Industrial section exes, took
35.6 p.c. of the net premiums (£1,711,782,
up £20,385) as against 34.9 p.c. and 35
p.c. in ’32 and ’3l respectively.
Accident business totalling £4,911,800
was written as against £1,386,750 in the
previous term. In addition, 8114 ordi-

risks, assuring £1,411,708 as against

This solid and prosperous Australian
fire and marine office was founded by
the far-sighted James Burns 48 years
ago. Of its half-million of capital,
£425,000 has come from reserves, which
were still visibly £246,901 in excess of
capital at the end of September. For
the 12 months to that date, net earnings
sprang £14,005, reaching 20.6 p.c. on
capital as against 17.8, 15.1, 12.4, 20.5
and 28.1 p.c. back to 1927. Still, the
div., which was sweetened with a 2\
p.c. bonus for 16 years to the close of
accounts in ’29, was kept at 10 p.c.
The improvement last year was due
to a better underwriting surplus, follow-
ing withdrawal from the American field
(the New York and Montreal offices, set
up in ’24 and ’25 respectively, were
closed before the books were ruled off
in ’3l) and curtailment of the unsatis-
factory London marine business. Though
the Sino-Japanese war and currency de-
preciation affected the figures for Eastern
Asia, the co. picked up on the swings
whatever it lost on the roundabouts:

Claims made off with £3 10s. less of
each £lOO of net premiums, and exes,
were reduced 6s. per cent., leaving the
underwriting surplus £16,788 better at
£38,829 as against £22,041 and £3077 for
the two preceding terms. Interest and
rents (£64,529) fell away £2783; still,
subject to taxation, they turned in
enough to show 12.8 p.c. on capital.
All this, together with the improve-
ment in the outlook generally, including
reductions in taxation, makes share-
holders’ prospects look as bright as any-
thing of the kind can under existing
conditions. The market lifted its bid
for the pound shares from 565. a year
ago to 60s. 6d. or thereabouts at last
week-end. At 60s. 6d. the return is 3.3
p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis, or 4.1 p.c.
should the 2\ p.c. bonus be restored.
Visibly the net tangible cover is 495. lOd.
per share.
Policy-holders are well protected ; they
could see net tangibles equal to 286 p.c.
of the year’s net premiums, whereas 150
p.c. is usually considered adequate. And
assets can be taken as well worth their
book value:

Paid capital is £1,430,173, and there was
£9040 coming to sundry creditors and
£212,377 to associated cos. at Oct. 31.
The lot, together with reserves, was in-
vested in a group of jam- and fruit-can-
ning and -preserving subsidiaries, scat-
tered all over Australia and Maori-
land, and extending to England and
S. Africa as well. The co. was
formed in 1909 (with a half-million of
capital) by Henry Jones and his able
lieutenant, Arch Palfreyman, who is now
at the helm. Over the 20 years to the
close of accounts in ’29, divs. average
a wink under 11 p.c. p.a., sweetened with
£455,492 of bonus scrip in ’27, though
share premiums (£59,040) take a bit of
the gilt off the gingerbread.
•Then slump and other things brought
a contraction of 59.1 p.c. in visible net
returns from the co.’s Australian invest-
ments over the two years to the close
of accounts in ’29. During the same
period income from abroad shrank 20
p.c.:
1929. 1931. 1932. 1933.

Total ..£160,637 £91,554 £171,066 £111,413
In ’32 the subsidiaries’ experience in re-
spect of bad debts was reported to be
almost normal, and the Australian figures
sprang £79,512. During the last term
£59,595 of the gain was lost, due to
overproduction of canned fruits, fol-
lowed by local price-cutting and an un-
satisfactory volume of export sales.
There was little change in returns from
the co.’s overseas investments. The net
return from all sources was 7.7 p.c. on
capital as against 11.9, 6.4, 8.3, 11.3 and
11 p.c. back to 1928. So points were
knocked off the div., reducing it to
p.c.
On the market the pound shares fell
from 395. in 1928 to 17s. lOd. a couple
of years ago, and then rose sharply to
395. 4d., notwithstanding the chairman’s
statement that the assets of the sub-
sidiaries, if generously valued, would not
equal 395. 4d. Since publication of the
’33 figures, buyers have shortened their
bid to 335. 3d.; the return at that price
is 3.7 p.c. on a p.c. div. basis.
During the last three years there has
been a marked increase in the output

The contract with the Westralian Gov-
ernment for the supply of 10 miles of 24-
inch pipe between Perth and Kalgoorlie
put the spring in last year’s figures.
Only two-fifths of the work was
completed when the books closed ; the
other three-fifths is expected to be fin-
ished about the end of Dec., a new fac-
tory having been put up at Victoria Park
(W.A.) for the purpose. The plants at
Lane Cove (N.S.W.) and Footscray (Vic.)
worked to about one-third capacity ; yet
all contracts filled showed a profit.
Though the £4153 of profit claimed
was no more than 3.9 p.c. on capital as
against 1.8 p.c. in the previous term,
the div. was doubled, making 5 p.c. for
the year, the average over the last decade
being 5.9 p.c. To pay the 5 p.c. reserves
were tapped for £1097, reducing the lay-
by to £4llB in excess of the £B2OO at
which rights, etc., appear.
Prospects are said to be brightest in
Westralia, and Government and local
government bodies elsewhere propose to
spend a bit more on water-supply
schemes, etc. Competition, of course,
remains keen, and that means narrow
margins; still, the wood pipe has its
special advantages, and thus far its own
particular market. On ’Change the
pound shares advanced from 10s. to
15s. 9d. over the last 12’months; the
return at the higher figure is 6.3 p.c.
on a 5 p.c. div. basis. The cover is
20s. 9d. in net tangibles, mainly plant,
etc., worth what it can earn.
Here is the position as balance-sheet
figures show it:

Burma Malay’s Purchase
Burma Malay Tin has bought 834
acres of alluvial, estimated to contain
45,000,000 c.y. of payable dirt, at Ban-
grin, Western Siam, for £15,000 (sterling)
plus £BOOO in paids in Renong Consoli-
dated, a subsidiary. The area, which
contains the Thalang property, formerly
owned by Sydney Siam, has been bored
by A. J. Peterson and H. G. S. Keid. On
a conservative estimate, they figure that
there is 34,000,000 c.y. of .771 b. ground
and 8,000,000 c.y. of .501 b. stuff. Of the
lot the parent has sold about 15,000,000
c.y. to Renong for £lO,OOO in paids. The
net cost of the ground retained by the
parent is £12,000 —£15,000 less 2000
Renong shares sold on the market for
£3OOO. To provide for the equipment of
this ground the parent has issued 50,000
new £1 shares at 265. each (sterling), or
325. 6d. Australian currency. No com-
mission or underwriting fees were
paid in connection with the issue, which
is to be kept olf the market for 12
months. Later a new co. is to be formed
to take over and work the area now held
by the parent.
Burma Malay is also negotiating for
the purchase of a further 2,000,000 c.y.
of .701 b. ground adjoining Renong Con-
solidated’s area. This and the 15,000,000
c.y. already mentioned would give
Renong a life of from 15 to 20 years,
with other extensions in view.
The Croydon Syndicate, a Brisbane
crowd, is negotiating with southern in-
terests for the sale of the old Homeward
Bound, Table Top and Twelve Mile, all
on the outer Croydon field (N.Q.), and
profitable producers in the ’nineties of
last century. Here the shallow-worked
reefs generally run north and south in the
felsites, and the gold is worth around 645.
an ounce (statutory price), as against
about 445. from the nor’-westerly reefs
in the granites of the inner Croydon field.
* * * *
North Queensland G. M. Development
Co. has taken a 12 months’ option over
the Golden Hill area, a large low-grade
proposition covering about eight acres on
the Ravenswood field. The shaft (now
down 140 ft.) is to be dewatered and sunk
a further 100 ft., and levels are to be
driven each way. Cliff Rutledge is super-
vising operations. A number of claims
and leases have also been pegged on the
Bunker’s Hill line of reef at Kirk River.
The Kirk River Mining Syndicate, which
holds two 10-acre leases, has crushed its
first 6 tons 6cwt. at the Towers for 560 z.
18dwt. of smelted gold. A battery is to
be erected.
* * * *
On the old Woolgar goldfield (N.Q.)
54 tons has been put through for 320 z.
of gold. The Aurora got 15oz. from its
first 11 tons 6cwt. Here, in the bottom
of a short trench 10ft. deep, the reef is
2ft. 6in. wide. Near by another small
opencut has exposed a 2ft. reef, carry-
ing lOdwt. Other promising shows are
the Nil Desperandum, Beatrice and the
Peter Pan, where a five-head battery has
been erected. A few hundred tons of
ore at grass is expected to average 1 ldwt.,
with another 7dwt. in the tailings. Gold
was first discovered on the field in 1897,
and early crushings averaged about loz.
* * * *
Hamilton’s mill has treated 125 tons
for Lambert’s Surprise, the original mine
at Cracow (Q.), for 1350 z. of gold, and
it is estimated that nearly as much will be
recovered from the sands. Golden Ridge
is putting through 40 tons, and this will
be followed by 50 tons from Sinclair’s
claim which should go welL over tfie
ounce.
* * * *
Golden Mile, Cracow (Q.), is putting
in a new slimes-treatment plant at a cost
of between £2OOO and £3OOO. The job,
which should be completed in about eight
weeks, is expected to lower recovery costs
to Bs. per ton. Also, enlargement of the
three-million-gallon dam is under con-
sideration.
* * * *
After 30 years the old Jordan goldfield
fN.Q.) is being tried again. Jacobs and
party have struck a rich patch near the
old Wyreema mine, a profitable pro-
ducer in the early days. The new lode has
been traced for about 70ft., and varies
from 3in. to 12in. in width. Two parcels
aggregating 27 tons have returned 158 oz.
of gold. A three-head battery has been
erected.
The Pioneer, at Gaeta (C.Q.), recently
unwatered by Albert Roffey, a local cattle-
man, may become a gold producer after
25 years of idleness. Previously worked
by a Scottish co. to a depth of 180 ft., the
reef yielded average crushings of
and is only half stoped out on the bottom
level, where the lode is 3ft. 6in. wide.
Surface values have been proved for over
3000 ft., and parallel to the reef are a
number of rich leaders.
* * * *
Kamerunga G. M. Co. has taken over
the Queenslander and Australian mines
at Kamerunga (N.Q.). No. 1 shaft is
down 50ft. on from 4ft. to 7ft. of stone,
and values are improving. To date 160
tons of Bdwt. stuff has been crushed.
On the Mount Peter field, a new sin.
reef at the Mountain View is returning
4|oz. stone, while at the Talisman the
last 13 tons yielded 420 z. of gold. The
Golden Bar has been taken up again, and
a 110 ft. tunnel is being driven to crosscut
the reef. The last crushing yielded s|oz.
per ton. A 7in. reef at the Lucky
Wednesday Extended, where the main
shaft is down 40ft., is expected to crush
at least 2oz. to the ton.
* * * *
Some years ago a syndicate took over
the old Airlie mine at Towalla, on the
Russell goldfield (N.Q.). After dewater-
ing funds ran out, and the mine was
allowed to fill up again. Now another
party has installed a pump. Hopes are
that stone from the 120 ft. level and below
will provide funds for development. The
reef is small but rich; early crushings
ranged from 3oz. to 6oz. of gold per ton.
* * * *
A Sydney party, under H. Kearns, has
leased patches of black sands on the
Southport (Q.) beaches, which are to be
prospected for gold and rutile. Coolum
beach, north coast, also holds sands con-
taining rutile and ilmenite, and there is
talk of erecting a treatment plant there
at an early date.
* * * *
Warramulla Gold, which is developing
a line of para”el reefs east of those
worked by Tanami Gold (N.T.), is put-
ting up a battery to treat the stone from
its half-dozen leases. Opencuts have
been commenced along the line of lode,
and water has come in at 180 ft. in Kil-
martin’s shaft. Values remain to be
proved.
* * * *
Euratha Gold, Weethalle, 45 miles west
of Wyalong (N.S.W.), has proved the lode
for over 1500 ft. by seven shafts, down
from 80ft. to 200 ft. The ore-body con-
sists of oxidised black ironstone gossan.
In the n.-w. drive No. 5 shaft (150 ft.
level) 40ft. of ore with 110 ft. of back,
has been disclosed, values ranging from
3oz. to 4oz. There is over 5000 tons of
2oz. stuff available above 100 ft., and a
5000-ton p.a. plant is being erected. Costs
are put at about £3 per ton. The co.’s
two-million-gallon dam is full. Paid
capital is £30,000.

Mineral production in Tasmania for
the September quarter of 1933 was valued
at £291,408, of which copper (3244 tons)
contributed £131,179. Other minerals
were: Tin, 222 tons, £48,098 ; cement,
7006 tons, £24,521 ; carbide, 1134 tons,
£22,689; coal, 28,522 tons, £21,718;
gold, 1910 oz. fine, £12,129; silver,
125,8210 z. fine, £10,274; limestone,
27,469 tons, £8913; lead, 598 tons,
£7447 ; osmiridium, 1650 z., £1477 ; wol-
fram, £2423 ; shale, 974 tons, £448. In
addition the E. Z. Co. recovered 13,442
tons zinc (£298,648) and 41.5 tons cad-
mium (£5820) from other than Tas. ores.

At Norseman (W.A.) sufficient ore has
been mined to keep the completed first
units of the battery and the cyanide plant
running three shifts for the next two
months. The main shaft is to be sunk
another 100 ft., taking it to 700 ft., where
the sixth level will be opened out. Pro-
duction of 5000 tons per month is antici-
pated by the end of 1934, when the main
shaft is scheduled to reach 1000 ft.
Returns during the next couple of months
may not be so good as they were from
earlier development.
Goldfields Australian Development is
reported to be sampling the King of
Creation, Laverton (W.A.), which was

SHADOW SHOWS.
The sort of thing that goes on in
American beauty parlors is the subject-
matter of “Beauty for Sale,” at Melb.
State. “Beauty” is the right word, for
if any establishment of the kind in Mel-
bourne were staffed by such pulchritude
there would be a traffic block for half a
mile round the locality and all the police
would have to be called in from the
suburbs.
It would appear that in these insti-
tutions every employee automatically
acquires a sugar-daddy. The sugar-daddy
lavishes caviare and fur-coats on his
damsel and then leaves her, with a baby
sometimes, but with a broken heart
never. This fact is not lost on Letty
(Madge Evans), who has acquired a sugar-
daddy of her own (Qtto Kruger); but,
then, he really loves her. However, he
can’t marry her —although, contrary to all
the ethics of sugar-daddyism, he wants
to —because he has a wife who loves dogs
better than husbands. So Letty rejects
his proposal to set her up as a sort of
secondary wife and accepts the hand of a
wisecracking young man who is prepared
to lead her to the altar. At the sight
of that old-fashioned institution she
jibs, and goes off in a car, satis-
fied that life has nothing more to
give her and that she is destined to be
a virtuous but uninteresting spinster. At
this point she learns, to her astonishment,
that the dog-loving lady has got her
husband to divorce her because she likes
another man even better than Fido. So
virtue (and patience) is rewarded and
Letty gets a husband who really loves her
and moreover has lots of money and
doesn’t wisecrack.
Madge Evans is outstanding; and
Alice Brady as the wife with a patho-
logical affection for canines is almost a
characterisation.
The second picture, “Central Airport,”
has too much air smash in it, but ends
sensationally when R. Barthelmess re-
turns on a foggy night from rescuing his
best girl’s husband from a flying boat, is
guided to the landing ground by massed
motor-cars, hands over hubby and goes
off, full of gloomy satisfaction at his
own nobility.

“The World’s Greatest Thrills,” at
Sydney Capitol, packs into half an
hour a highly-concentrated essence of
the most sensational actual news-films
recorded in the last decade. Many
of them hadn’t been seen in Aus-
tralia before. Battle, murder and
sudden death are among its common-
places, and the records of a score of
nations have been sifted to provide
purple patches of incident and adven-
ture. Through it all comes a voice dron-
ing the perhaps necessary reminder that
many of the men who photographed
these things risked their lives in devotion
to their duty.
“The Light of Love,” on the same bill,
expounds the natural history of the glow-
worm ; exhibits its various metamor-
phoses, shows how the grub stalks and
devours snails, first paralysing them with
a hypodermic injection, and winds up
with a glow-worm marriage. A magni-
cent example of microscopic photography.
Gettting away from facts the Capitol’s
programme then dips into fiction. Hero
of “Heroes for Sale” is Richard Barthel-
mess, who after helping to win the Great
War becomes a drug addict, gets cured,
enters the steam laundry business, go-
gets, becomes part proprietor of a patent
worth millions, loses his wife (Loretta
Young), goes to gaol wrongly accused,
and comes out to donate the whole of
his wealth to a soup-kitchen. It doesn’t
seem likely.
In “Big Executive” Ricardo Cortez
smiles on pretty ladies and frowns
on financiers. After piling up count-
less millions by speaking tersely
through telephones, shooting his wife
accidentally, escaping a female black-
mailer (Sharon Lynne) and getting en-
gaged to Elizabeth Young, he loses all in
a stock-market flurry. Elizabeth hands
him back his engagement ring so that
he may hock it and start again, making
it clear that he still holds her heart.
Richard Bennett, as a financier of the
old school, wanders through the romance,
but does little to mitigate its many im-
probabilities.

“My Lips Betray,” at the Sydney
Regent, covers much the same ground
as “Adorable,” released a few months
ago. The new film is the better of the two,
the story being more convincing, less senti-
mental and full of surprises. It is Lilian
Harvey’s picture. She plays the part of
a little beer-garden singer, mistakenly
believed to be the ladylove of the mon-
arch of a pocket-handkerchief kingdom.
A joyride in a royal car given to
her by the chauffeur (El Brendel) starts
the rumor. Dismissed by the manager
of the beer-garden (Herman Bing), she
is promptly reinstated when the rumor
reaches his ears. Advertisement-seeking
tradespeople shower the bewildered
maiden with costly presents. Up to this
stage the king (John Boles) has remained
in the background, his time divided be-
tween composing songs and trying to
balance the Budget. Hearing of the
rumor, he goes out incog., makes the
girl’s acquaintance, finds she sings songs
of his own composition, and makes her
his queen. Miss Harvey tempers senti-
ment with humor; Boles uses his light
touch to advantage, and sings effectively.
Second string at the Regent, “The Mad
Game,” has kidnapping for its theme,
and was obviously inspired by incidents
in the Lindbergh case. A crook (Spencer
Tracy) is double-crossed by an associate
and put behind bars. He pleads with
the warder of the gaol to be allowed out
on parole in order to put a stop to a
series of kidnappings. The warder con-
sents. Tracy has his face surgically
altered, and mixes freely with the bad
element of the town without being recog-

nised. With the aid of a girl reporter, he
identifies the kidnappers and gets riddled

The artistic event of the week in Mel-
bourne was the opening of a new picture
theatre in Bourke-street. It used to be
the Strand in a previous existence, and
then it became a shooting gallery. A dis-
tinguished assembly rolled up, dressed
like penguins, the illusion being deepened
by the appearance of the foyer, whose
mural decorations suggested hung dra-
peries of burnished silver against an ivory
background, very like an iceberg. King
Penguin Premier Argyle delivered a
p<ean on the British motion-picture in-
dustry ; an American picture set in
Morocco and spoken through the nose
following. A different item was substi-
tuted for this on Saturday. The second
half was given over to “Falling for You”
—unmistakably British.
Sundry Shows
Why Wagner should be linked with
Brahms in a celebration of the centenary
of the latter’s birth is not very clear. The
A.8.C., which gave a concert of works
by both composers at Sydney Town Hall
on Saturday, says this year is the hun-
dredth since Wagner became a profes-
sional musician. That’s quite true, but
it is also the two hundredth year since
the death of Couperin and the hun-
dredth since the death of Herold, rather
more significant anniversaries. Possibly,
since the music of Brahms is almost as
unpopular to-day as it was in his own
time, it was felt that an all-Brahms pro-
gramme would be impolitic, and the
more exciting composer was pulled in to
make weight. Certainly the honors of
the recital went to the excerpts from
“The Valkyries.” Prof. Bernard Heinze,
of Melbourne, had a practically full-size
symphony orchestra under his baton, but
the performance of the Brahms First
Symphony was uninspiring. Plagiarism,
conscious or unconscious, was Brahms’s
besetting handicap, and where the First
rises to the heights it does so on wings
borrowed from Beethoven. Moreover,
the interpretation : was ungraceful. In
the Wagner section Madame Orff-Sol-
scher made an excellent Brunnhilde and
Walter Kingsley voiced the woes of Wotan
melodiously and with dignity. Both,
however, were occasionally a little over-
weighted by the orchestra, which was too
near the soloists, and the Valkyries, sing-
ing their loudest, were ofttimes drowned
in a blare of brass. However, the fire
music was delivered with enormous
gusto, and wound up the concert in a
blaze of glory.

Dame Clara Butt sat her white and blue
draperies in the mayoral throne decorated
with blue at Melb. Town Hall, and sang
to a crowd that had flocked to see her
on Saturday. Oh, such songs, most of
them! All about old women and little
dogs, and ending up with the one about
the dear little baby ; some were in Ger-
man. Goodness knows what they were
about, but they suited her voice, because
she had a cold ; and she still has that
roguish look in the eye which was there
in the old days when Kennerley Rum-
ford used to chase her round the grand
piano. The Amati instrumental trio did
their best to put the concert back on the
map, musically speaking. Sisserman com-
manded the audience’s strict attention, in
spite of the fact that his facial expres-
sions when playing Faure and Ravel
partook of vaudeville; and one can
always listen with pleasure to Raymond
Lambert because he gives one the impres-
sion that he likes making lovely sounds
on a piano. Philip Cohen, violinist, de-
serves a pat on the back for including
Mozart in the patriotic proceedings, and
the audience had the privilege of sing-
ing the first verse of “God Save” while
the Dame beat time, and she sang the
second herself, and then everybody sang
the third ; and all went home feeling that
they had done their bit towards the wel-
fare of the Royal family.

Respighi’s symphonic work “The Pines
of Rome,” performed by the Sydney Con.
orchestra on a recent evening, demon-
strates how very wise it was for the
musical path-makers of a century or two
centuries ago to eschew programmatic
titles, and to present their finest inspira-
tions without a label. Debussy’s sub-
merged cathedral has justified its nomen-
clature to the imagination of thousands
of hearers, but as there are no submerged
cathedrals —if there were they would
emit no more sound than a lost anchor —■
he might as well have referred to a whale
in a butter-boat. Pines do make music,
as poets by the hundred have testified,
but it wasn’t that sort of music Respighi
had in mind. He endeavored to portray
various scenes associated with the pine-
trees of Rome—the cries of children at
play for an introduction (it isn’t a bit like
children at play), and a finale dominated
by drums and gongs which might repre-
sent a parade of Fascisti, a triumph
staged by J. Caesar or a scene from “Chu
Chin Chow.” The orchestration is for-
bidding, using as staple fare harmonic
combinations of a sort that Bach, Beet-
hoven and Mozart regarded merely as a
spicy condiment. Glazounov’s A Minor
Concerto, an arrangement of Bach airs
by Sir Henry Wood, Mozart’s “Haffner”
symphony and Schubert’s “Rosamunde”
overture afforded grateful relief.

Satisfactory numbers streamed into the
Town Hall, Melbourne, for the popular
concert of the Melbourne Symphony
Orchestra and A.B.C. Two local produc-
tions were shy debutantes on the pro-
gramme. Prelude “Isolt of the White
Hands,” by Fritz Hart, was conducted by
the composer. It proved as vivid, as viva-
cious and as discursive as its author. It
darted from one engaging theme to
another like a bee somewhat distracted by
the riches of a garden, leaving its audi-
ence a trifle breathless. There was such
rare beauty in the tail-end of it that one
would have liked to hear it a third time to
deepen the impression. Followed a
lyrical sketch by Hubert Clifford, the
young Melbourne composer now in Eng-
land, a Fritz Hart pupil. It was a
graceful fragment, obviously flattering
the writer’s mentor. The Mozart Con-
certo in D Major made a bad beginning,
violinist Gertrude Healy being out of
harmony with her instrument. In the
intervals between the next two move-
ments she argued with it and apparently
came to an agreement, for the last move-
ment was sensitively played and was : n
beautiful tone with .the orchestral back-
ground. During the Schumann Sym-
phony in B Flat, Op. 38, present critic
went yogi. Schumann was an excellent
confector of charmingly romantic ballads
and suchlike, but in this symphony he
seems to repeat himself unnecessarily or
couldn’t think of anything fresh to add ;
but the andante was delightful.

Hugo Larsen, just returned from the
Old World, has engaged pianist Leff Pou-
shinoff and singer Horace Stevens, who
will arrive in Australia early in the New
Year. Poushinoff, now that Pachmann
has gone to where harps are the only
musical instruments, is said to be the
world’s leading Chopin exponent.
Stevens, an Australian by birth, won his
laurels in opera and oratorio.

“The Eternal Spring” sprang for four
nights only at the Kelvin Hall, Mel-
bourne. It was nourished by the talents
of the Little Theatre, Brett Randall,
Betty Tait, Frank Nelson and Denise
Finch being better cast than Keith
Campbell, whose juvenile needed the ex-
perience of maturity. Peter Garland’s
comedy is cleverly constructed and has
some of the stuff of humanity in it.

To assist the State Relief Committee’s
Christmas fund, “Baa Baa Black Sheep”
was supplied with the agistment of a fair
audience at the Bijou, Melbourne, last
week. It is a typical P. G. Wodehouse

and the Cairns Memorial players dealt
out justice to it.

ABORIGNALITIES
“Hampstead Hall”: I remember well
my first experience with the N.S.W. flea.
We had not long arrived from England,
and had taken over a farm at Uki. My
mother and I were caught in a fierce
sub-tropical rainstorm (another new ex-
“I’m just about fed up with this tinned stuff.”
perience) and we dashed to the nearest
shelter, which was the stable. After a
few moments there we had tb take off our
stockings—our legs were covered with
a black mass of fleas. We could see the
late tenant, who was staying on for a
while until his affairs were settled, riding
towards us. Both of us felt that some-
thing drastic must be done. Mother was
thinking of the shame, for in England a
woman that finds a flea upon her prem-
ises is adjudged a dirty housewife. But
it was too late to do anything. He dis-
mounted, and the blood rushed to
mother’s face. He was the first to speak,
“Whatever is the matter?” he asked. At
last mother stammered, “Insects.... those
are insects.” “Insects! ” he roared.
“They’re fleas! Hold your legs out in
the rain and wash ’em off!”
* * * *
“Marron”: A Donnybrook (W.A.)
farmer recently shot a fully grown ’roo.
On examination of the carcass it was dis-
covered that a flaxen cord, evidently tied
round its neck when a pet in its joey days,
had bitten half an inch into the flesh,
completely severing the skin all round.
The bullet must have brought merciful
relief, as blowflies had been getting in a
lot of work.
* * * *
“Desert Rat”: When I was clearing in
the Westralian wheat-belt a few years ago
I came across a small insect that repre-
sented perfectly a broken twig—the best
example of insect camouflage I have ever
seen. The body, of a dark grey color,
was cylindrical, about half an inch
long and about the thickness of a lead
pencil. The head end was finished off like
any broken twig and the sides were
cracked into minute squares—the same as
other dead twigs on the branch whereon
I got it. The legs were fitted so as to
give the body an angle of about 45
degrees from any surface it rested on.
Any member of the Council know this
joker’s name?

“L. R. Russ”: Brigadier-General
Crozier is reported to have said: “In the
next war I would take every man between
the ages of 45 and 70, every member of
Parliament, every Cabinet Minister, the
whole of Whitehall and drag them
through it.” Somewhat similar views
were cherished by the Zulu rulers before
the power of the race was broken by the
white invasion. Their method of select-
ing war-drafts was approximately as
follows: First, men between the ages of
45 and 60; second, between 35 and 45 ;
third, between 25 and 35, and those over
60 who were still capable of bearing
arms ; last of all, the young men up to
25 years of age. In this, way men who
already had their families established
bore the first shock of battle and weak-
ened the resistance that could be offered
to the advance of the younger men. The
potential fathers of the succeeding genera-
tion were conserved as far as possible,
only going into the fighting line when it
was unavoidable. We civilised folk sac-
rifice the fittest of the young men in the
first clash of battle, leaving the old men
and the unfit to carry on the race.

“Tea-Tree”: On Maculka station, far
west N.S.W., a valuable blood mare was
being stable-fed. One day a camel that
had strayed sauntered to the sft. gate
of the mare’s loose-box and peered over.
The mare abruptly raised her head, gave
a snort that concluded in a tremulous
whine, and, with terror-dilated eyes star-
ing at the apparition, began to tremble.
Suddenly she lurched forward with a
pitiful moan, rolled over and lay still.
The flies buzzed busily round a defunct
horse, and the dromedary loped away. I
was the unlucky cove detailed to handle
the refractory prads that dragged the
corpse to the cremation-pyre,

“The Antiquary”: “Devil’s advocate”
(B. 15/11 /’33) is one of the few phrases
in which his Satanic Majesty figures that
has survived. I suppose there are still
such things as printers’ devils, and people
still say “the devil to pay” and order
“devilled” kidneys, but most of the refer-
ences to Nick have gone to limbo. Fire-
works, the sharpened anchor used by
trawlers for cutting the nets of drifters in
the North Sea, gin flavored with capsi-
cums, a grilled bone seasoned with mus-
tard and cayenne, a species of firewood
soaked in resin, a sandstorm—all these
have at one time or another been dubbed
devil. The steam whistle or hooter when
first employed at factories was termed
“American devil” ; an indifferent artist
was a “devil-drawer” ; the four of clubs
was “the devil’s fourposter” ; broad
arrows on prison uniforms were “devil’s
claws” ; old cloth shredded for re-manu-
facture was “devil’s dust,” a military
synonym also for gunpowder. “Devil’s
guts” designated a surveyor’s chain, and
“devil’s smiles” betokened weather with
“Now, you aren’t one of those sailors who have a wife in every port, are you?"
“Well, not exactly, missus. F’rinstance, I’ve never bin to Bombay.”
alternations of sunshine and rain. How
many more there have been, the devil
only knows.

“Grandpa Koala”: We bush folk —
birds, beasts, trees and flowers—stand in
need of all our friends as the holiday
season approaches. As the Wild Life Pre-
servation Society points out in a special
appeal, in N.S.W. we have legal protec-
tion; every public-school teacher is a
ranger, and there are scores of honorary
rangers, but the rangers can t be every-
where. great many offences against
us (and don t forget that we bush-dwellers
have a claim to the friendship of every
good Australian) are committed thought-
lessly. Deliberate destructiveness and
enmity are rare, and they ought to be
sternly discouraged to make them rarer.
The society appeals to all its sym-
pathisers to report wilful offenders to
Ihs police or (he nearest ranger. Pre-
venhon of bushflres, too, should receive
special attention. Be careful to put out
campfires and make sure that matches,
cigarette butts and pipe ashes are extin-
guished before they are thrown away.
“Felix”: For some unexplained reason
Melbourne is essentially the City of Cats,
as a walk through its deserted fastnesses
any Sunday afternoon will show. The
hordes of felines which infest the town
and the parks are fast destroying the bird
life in and about Melbourne and are
now sending out patrols to the far-out-
lying suburbs. The Victorian Field
Naturalists’ Club is up in arms about
it. One suggestion is that all cats
be registered: ss. for a gentleman
cat, 10s. for the much more dan-
gerous female of the species. That
seems quite all right as far as the
home-keeping cat with a fixed address is
concerned, but what about the hordes
of Hal o’ the Wynd cats that roam Mel-
bourne, each fighting for its own hand?
Dogs can be pursued and caught with
little difficulty. It would take a thumping
big salary and capitation bonus to make
me accept the job of Government or
municioal cat-catcher.

“Dr. Mivart”: Melbourne, aided and
abetted by its Animal Welfare League,
hitherto, if I am not misinformed, prin-
cipally famous for its clinic for overfed
poodles, has declared war on “stray cats.”
Chatter Page (B. 29/11 /’33) records the
rejoicings of the rats. If Melbourne likes
to indulge in a rat-preservation week let
it, but an order for the wholesale capture
and destruction of cats found at large
without passports or identification discs
gives too wide a roving commission. Most
prized of my many cat acquaintances is
Rozzener. His tail was chewed off (I sus-
pect by a dingo) years before we met. He
has only one eye and his body bears the
scars of a thousand battles. If I se c
him for three minutes once a week I
know he is in an exceptionally sociable
mood. When he wants me he jumps on
to the ledge of my laboratory window
and mews. I let him in ; dry him with
his own towel if he’s wet; give him
surgical aid if he needs it (I once put nine
stitches in his neck, and I have relieved
him of innumerable ticks). In immediate
return he sits and looks at me for two
minutes purring madly. I then give him
a saucer of milk and he departs. But
such is his reputation that no rat or
mouse dares invade my domain ; no
dog dares scratch in my garden plots ;
no cat dares lie in my lavender beds,
He isn’t my cat—l’m just his doctor—but
if harm came to him I’d feel sorry. And
if a cat-catcher went down Sydney’s
Sussex-street and copped the dozens of
yoU ng and friendly kittens that take the
sun on that thoroughfare—progeny of

“Cooramin”: The wanderings of the
Emden bell remind me of the petrified
blackfellow in South Australia. In the
early shepherding days a darky who had
been shot for stealing sheep crawled
down into the limestone caves on Mos-
quito Plains, and there died. When
found long afterwards the body was pre-
served in a stony shroud, formed by
drippings from the roof of the cave,
Geologist Tenison Woods described it as
almost petrified, and lying like one asleep,
Wl m the head resting on one hand. Soon
after its discovery the curio was stolen,
but it was recovered before the thieves
had time to smuggle it away. It was re-
placed in the cave, and enclosed in an
iron palisading. But that didn’t hold it
long; it was stolen again, and this time
taken to Europe—sold, it was believed,
to a German university,
* * * *
“Te Kapo”: Ever hooked a nine-fin
trout? One was recently taken from
the Opihi River (M.L.), and anglers of
the Shaky Isles are now eagerly debat-
ing whether or not it is unique. Self-
respecting members of the Salmonidce
family don’t run beyond dorsal, adipose,
caudal, anal and pectoral fins, but this
fellow had an extra one on the back,
right behind the head. It gave him a
deformed appearance, something like a
hunchback.
THE OLD ACCORDION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the last notes of cicadas in the trees have
ceased to ring,
And the crickets and the bullfrogs in the creek
begin to sing,
When the evening breeze comes rustling
round the chimney and the eaves
And along the, old bush pathway, whisp’ring
secrets to the leaves;
In the dreamy summer evenings when the
shadows start to fall,
And the fire throws its magic, dancing pictures
on the wall,
Then I seem to see a vision of the days that
long are gone,
And hear again the music of an old accordion.
Very smart it sounds and merry, very sharp
and very clear,
And I see the player playing in the shed at
Windeemeer,
Keeping time with swaying body and a wild
outlandish yell,
And the dancing feet enchanted by the music’s
magic spell.
Little Jacky Horner’s bluchers step a stately
measure out
With the prim and proper slippers of Miss
Arabella Clout,
And the tomboy Mary Ellen taps a dainty
foot upon
Some poor heart that’s not as merry as the
old accordion.
Arabella, Arabella now is looking down, I
trust,
On her prim and proper footwear, long since
mouldered into dust;
And the laughing Mary Ellen, with her pranks
and all her boys,
And the hearts that she has broken, is above
the stir and noise
Of the earthly hopes they cherished. I alone
am left to mourn
For the golden hours I knew before the most
of you were born,
When I had a tender sweetheart whose blue
eyes with rapture shone
As we gaily danced to music of an old
accordion.
The accordion has vanished, and its reeds no
more vibrate;
The player is forgotten and his art is out of
date.
But the chirping of the crickets and the fire’s
magic glow
Still recall to me the music and the mirth of
long ago.
And I somehow rather fancy that, when life
for me is o’er,
And I meet my old companions over on the
Golden Shore,
With our riding-tops and haloes and our wings
and bluchers on,
We will dance at night to music of an old
accordion.

“D’Artagnan”: When John Costello,
the pioneer of western Queensland, was
passing through new country near the
Diamantina River in the early ’sixties, he
carved his initials on a lone tree and
passed on. Years afterwards Barcroft
Boake saw the inscription and wrote a
ballad about the man who (he assumed)
had gasped Qut his last breath in the
agonies of thirst. “Out Where the Dead
Men Lie” reached England, and a jour-
nalist wrote a highly-imaginative story
of the unknown hero (who at that time
Was pioneering the Roper River country
in the N.T.). Incidentally, a small town
sprang up near the tree and named itself
“J.C.” The Survey Department has since
changed the name to Canterbury.
* * * *
“Runa”: Improvised bait, is it? We
were running out by the Noisies in the
Hauraki Gulf (M.L.) to a well-known
mussel-bank where snappers congregated,
when it was discovered the bait had
been left ashore. The skipper of the
launch was not perturbed. He cruised
round until he saw a flock of tern harass-
ing a shoal of kahawai, and inquired if
any lady had a brooch. A gaudy belt-
buckle was the nearest thing, and it was
attached to a line, while the launch ran
full-speed through the tern and emerged
with a fine kahawai in tow. We caught
40 large snappers in the next hour.
* * * *
“Spare Sawbones”: “C. Coral’s”
saurian enterolith (B. 8 /11 / ’33) is pro-
bably a gallstone belonging to the pris-
tine owner of the associated bones.
“Madam, I NEVER pay in advance.”
“An’, judgin’ by th’ look of yer, not at no other time.”
Stones form in all sorts of places in the
animal body, and the gallstone is the
most likely of them all to resist the action
of gastric juices. Croc.’s inelegant feed-
ing technique would allow of their fre-
quent ingestion. Similar occurrences are
not at all uncommon in humans. Sur-
geons not infrequently find a bullet in the
appendix of an individual fond of game
foods.
“0.W.W.”: Henare, married 12
months, gave a christening party for his
two-months-old son, and the vicar
addressed the gathering. Concluding a
flowery-worded discourse, he said: “I’ll
now ask the lad’s august father to say a
few words.” Henare was up in an
instant. “August father, me he
roared. “Te poy come in Decemper.”
* * * *
“Moby-Dick”: Re this sturgeon and
whale business, Bracton lays it down
that of all whales captured on the
coast of England (and presumably
British possessions) the King, as Hon-
orary Grand Harpooner, must have
the head, and the Queen the tail
(which means halving the whale). Plow-
don says that a whale belongs to the King
and Queen “because of its superior ex-
cellence” ; and in his treatise on “Queen
pin-money” an old King’s Bench author,
William Prynne, says “Ye tail is ye
Queen’s, that ye Queen’s wardrobe be
supplied with ye whalebones.” The stur-
geon is also included by Prynne in the
King’s right—doubtless also because of
its “superior excellence.” I don’t know
if Queen Mary takes an interest in “ye
whalebones,” but Queen Bess, by all
accounts, used ’em by the bushel.
* * * *
“Pat Bushie”: As the nearest earthly
approach to the Sportsman’s Paradise I
nominate Poole Island, about eight miles
from Bowen (Q.). About 30 acres in
extent, it contains specimens of practi-
cally all wild Australian tropical life.
Kangaroos and all other classes of hop-
pers, brumbies, wild pigs, snakes, lizards,
goannas, wild ducks, wild turkeys, domes-
tic fowls gone bush and capable of flight
like birds, waterhen, geese and all manner
of small birds abound in the scrub. The
waters teem with barramundi (king of
Australian fishes), coral salmon, bril-
liantly-colored parrot-fish, giant trevalli
and kingfish. Oysters, extra-large, crowd
the rocks. Barrier turtles abound, and
during September and October one can
catch king praWns by the million.
* * * *
“L.R.”: Although it’s just December
1 was bitten the other day by a March-
fly. This would seem to indicate that,
unlike birds, flies are seasonally in-
coherent.
* * * *
“Kayeff”: Fabre experimented with the
Chalicodoma, or mason bee, which builds
a cell of mud to hold its honey and egg.
He discovered that the bee could return
to the exact spot occupied by its home,
over unknown terrain, from a distance of
over two miles, yet was unable to dis-
cover its nest if it had been moved 6in.
during her absence. Substituting another
nest for the original, he found that the
bee unhesitatingly dived into the strange
nest and unloaded its cargo, even if a
cell just commenced and poorly stocked
with honey was placed in the position
occupied by one which the bee had
almost filled. Fabre did not confuse
one bee with another. He marked them
before he made the tests.
“Snahhan”: The reference to the late
Dr. Calmette’s endeavors to find a serum
antidote for snake poisons (B. 8/11 /’33)
reminds me that the Hall Institute and the
Commonwealth Serum Laboratories have
made good progress as far as individual
snakes are concerned and are hot on
the trail of a universal serum which will
neutralise the bite of any poisonous
wriggler from a rattlesnake to a coral
snake. Two effective serums have been
proved to date. One is for the poison of
the tiger snake ; but, since it costs £6 a
dose, it is not likely to be stocked by bush
storekeepers. An antidote has also been
found for the venom of the copperhead,
but this is not yet on the market. So
far the poison of the death adder, most
dreaded of them all, has remained
unconquered.
* * * *
“Black Mountain”: I’ve done a fair
bit of rabbit-trapping, but never found
the job as hard as “Dai R.” says it is,
though I was trapping for the carcass.
Like every other trapper of my acquaint-
“Stand back a bit, mister; you're starting to warp.”
ance, I took a mate. On the first day
we set in the morning, and went round
at sundown. We did a round at about
9 p.m., returning at about midnight or
a little after. Away again before day-
light, we had finished the round, break-
fasted and had the catch ready to be
taken to the freezing works or depot by
8 a.m. While one man drove in, the
other set his traps again, cooked dinner
for his mate and then helped him to set.
The next morning it was the other chap’s
turn to drive to the depot, and so on.
This allowed plenty of time for sleep,
made the tasks less irksome and gave a
degree of companionship. The extra
round (midnight) is seldom a paying
proposition, and hundreds of trappers
have discarded it.
* * * *
“Billabong”: Plentiful now in the
Barcoo district (Q.) is an unlovely cousin
of the trap-door spiders, known as Mis-
sulena rubrocapitata. His business end,
the color of a ripe tomato, houses fangs
measuring a quarter of an inch. Red-
head ranges over most of Australia,
though so far very little is known of his
habits. Writer had one of these aggres-
sive fellows in captivity for about a
month in .which time he ate nothing but
remained lively. Can’t say whether he
is poisonous. Nobody round our way
loves the cause of science sufficiently to
submit to being bitten.
* * * *
“Cootparra”: In many years spent in
the north and north-west of Australia
my experience has been that ill-treatment
of natives, either by police or pastoralists,
is almost non-existent. As for police
bringing in natives on the chain from
distant places, it is the only practicable
method. The chains are light and the
men wearing them can walk freely with-
out discomfort. Handcuffs are useless,
as a native’s hands and wrists are prac-
tically the same width. Binghi has the
mentality of a child. If you promise him
anything, never fail to give it, whether
it be a whacking or tobacco and
clothes. Fail, and he will regard you
with suspicion and dislike. As a man-
ager of a Murchison station in W.A.
once said to me, “How can you expect
natives to understand kindness when they
are not kind to one another?” This
man always got good work from his
boys. He treated them with a strictness
that bordered on harshness, but never
broke a promise. They always spoke
of him as “Good pfeller, boss.” Most
of the piffle about ill-treatment of Aus-
tralian natives comes from people who
have rarely seen an abo.
* * * *
“Black Doctor”: The opening of the
trout-fishing season in N.S.W. was
marked by the usual massacre of these
sporting fish. One Sydney journal glee-
fully reported that its information from
the trout waters indicated that a hundred-
weight had been landed in one district in
the one day. This is not fishing in the
sense that to catch fish, especially the
introduced trout, is a sport. It is sheer
fish murder —one might just as well
throw a plug of dynamite into a stream.
Photographs show a horde of people sit-
ting by a trout water with baited lines
chucked in and waiting for a bite. If the
carefully stocked N.S.W. waters are not
to be depleted of trout, the Government
will have to make some drastic altera-
tions in the regulations. Every fisher-
man in trout waters must take out a
license. Hand-line fishing must be wiped
out, and, though the use of the worm on
the rod cannot be barred, fishermen
should be restricted as much as possible
to the fly, dry for preference, with the
spinner recognised but not encouraged.
* * * *
“Macti”: Crocodiles are so numerous
along one part of the n.-e. coast of
Papua, near Gcodenough Bay, that the
natives have difficulty in obtaining fresh-
fish supplies. Shoals of whitebait find
their way to certain parts, however, and
the Boianai natives have worked up a
brisk trade in dried whitebait, which,
packed in bundles, is bartered for other
commodities.
* * * *
“Eucalalie”: The virtues of the Aus-
tralian eucalypts are appreciated in many
countries. The U.S.A. has renamed one
species ( Eucalyptus globulus) the “Cali-
fornian gum-tree,” and in California
there are dozens of cities and towns with
no other sorts of trees in their streets.
One of the most beautiful roads in Egypt
—that leading to the Great Pyramids—
is fringed with eucalypts. In Greece the
railway station of Olympia is fragrant
with the trees, and near the Leaning
Tower of Pisa flourishes a magnifi-
cent blue-gum. In Rome the Pontinian
marshes have been made healthy by
being planted with blue-gums. Miles and
miles of the trans-Siberian railway are
lined with eucalypts. In Algiers exten-
sive malarial swamps have been trans-
formed in a similar manner. Eucalypts
have been adopted for decorative pur-
poses in Abyssinia, Morocco, South
Africa, India (they even flourish in the
Himalayan region), Chile and the Argen-
tine. In Palestine, where a vigorous tree-
planting policy is in force, eucalypts are
being extensively used, and the Monash
Forest, a memorial to the Australian
soldier, consists of 10,000 of the trees,
the gift of Jews in Australia. The forest
is near Megiddo.
THE HUNTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
His body bare, his feet unshod,
Keen-questing over every rod
Where bough and bramble hang,
He treads the bush his fathers trod
With spear and boomerang.
With ears alert for every sound,
His sharp eyes roving round and round,
He roams as dingoes prowl,
And reads the marks on grass and ground
That tell of beast and fowl.
And like some shadow far behind,
O’er tracks that climb and dip and wind
His gin walks warily,
Lest she might scare what he might find
And only he might see.
She gazes ever straight ahead,
Nor worries where her feet may tread,
Though danger may be near,
Her one concern and only dread
The hunter with the spear.
She watches as though stalking him,
Responsive to his every whim.
His stealth or careless slouch,
Anon his manner tense and grim,
Quick pause and sudden crouch.
She sees his body bend and sway,
And knows the game’s not far away
Below the hiding hill;
Nor lets her gaze a moment stray
From where he creeps to kill.
She watches for his one command,
A leg thrust back that bids her stand
Till he has speared his meat,
And a coo-ee or a lifted hand
Tells they may rest and eat.

“The Scot has always had a genius for

True. Take Haggis McWhoosh, whose

proved to be three sizes too small for
him. It was his determination to get
his weight down sufficiently to allow
him to wear them that led to the inven-
tion known (incorrectly) as the Turkish
bath.
Honored also is the mem-
ory of Sporran McSporran.
Visiting a rural district, he
noticed that farm horses
always seemed blown up
after a small feed of . oats,
and. he set to work to evolve
pabulum that would have a
like effect on his boarders.
The result of his labors, as
boardinghouse - keepers the

Scotch oatmeal.
When Angus Mcßagpipe
inherited his uncle’s gramo-
phone he found that it took
him about 20 minutes to get
a good point again on his

FIRST LAWN TENNIS TEST.
[Mr. Lang’s newspaper reports it.]
Yesterday at the White City the repre-
sentatives of effete England—at whose
denial of the charge of debt-repudiation
made by this paper the whole world is
laughing— met the chosen of Australia,
now temporarily in the toils of a vicious
Toryism. The crowd was composed of
silvertails and tall poppies—for how
could the toiling masses, eking out a
bare existence on the miserable pittance
ordained by the present Government of
political nitwits, afford to pay the exor-
, bitant entrance-money arrogantly de-
i manded by the oligarchic L.T.A. ?
The special exhibition court was as
fast as the action of the bunch of super-
annuated political misfits at Canberra in
reducing pensions, and as green as the
now sadly disillusioned voters who put
them in power.
Crawford won the toss —yet the Coun-
cil of Churches, who never tire of attack-
ing the State lottery, inaugurated with
statesmanlike foresight by our great and
fearless leader, remain strangely silent
about this particular gamble—and com-
menced serving to Perry. The English-
man started driving with a vim only
excelled by some unscrupulous sweating
employers. He is obviously glad to be
away from a country which refuses to
concede the unanswerable demands of
President de Valera.
Games went with the services until
Crawford broke through, to win easily
at 6-4 —as easily as the Hon. J. T. Lang
will win the next elections.
In the second set Perry started to chop
heavily—an accomplishment that should
endear him to the minions of the Em-
ployers’ Federation now on the Treasury
benches. Crawford resorted to lobbing
(not to be confused with the practice of
lobbying so favored by the cohorts of
Bligh-street), thus giving the Englishman
“Well, is there any little shellfish you’d
like me to catch for you?”
“No, thanks, sonny. The only thing you
could please me by catching is the
next tram home.”
a chance to smash. In this he proved
as successful as the U.A.P.
At this period a sharp shower drove
the players pavilionwards, where for the
rest of the afternoon they were com-
pelled to gaze at a prospect as dreary
as that of the wageplug who trusted the
saintly Stevens.

THE NEWER FARMING .
I remember, I remember the farm where
.1 -was born,
And when we took a simple pride in
growing pigs and corn.
Now Susan has a fine contempt for cows
and milking-pails,
And Kate’s become a dashing blonde
and tints her finger-nails.
I remember, I remember our Dan was
full of zeal
For field-days—now he kids himself he’s
full of sex appeal ;
And Dave, who used to be so keen on
helping with the hay,
Now waves his hair and says “Ses
you! ” a hundred times a day.
I remember, I remember our Lizzie’s
fancy bread;
She never makes it any more — it’s “film
tests” now instead.
So hip-hip-hooray for whoopee! To
blazes with the plough
Our family’s gone modern — yes, by
cripes it has, and how ! -

into their own again, as in the days of
Goldsbrough, Chester, Grand Flaneur,
Maltster and Wallace. For the present
season Heroic is again at the head of
the list of winning sires ; Windbag has
gained well-deserved fame at the stud :
and in South Australia the progeny of
King of Mirth are dominant as
juveniles. No hardier two-year-old could
be found in the Commonwealth than
Alinura, the beautifully modelled brown
filly that romped home in the second divi-
sion of the handicap for youngsters at
Moonee Valley last Saturday. Though it
was her 11th start since the beginning cf
August the granddaughter of Comedy
King scored, running away, from Triteleia
(by Great Star) and Chamundi (by Con-
stant Son). The hot favorite, Nullden,
ruined his chance by missing the jump
out.
Second division of the Two-year-old
Handicap went to Quarto, owned by J.
Spencer Brunton, of Sydney. Quarto led
almost from end to end and won com-
fortably by a length from Poultry, an
aptly-named filly by Drake. Quarto
comes from the same family as Semper,
the dam of Ruling Light. Quarto and
Ruling Light both won at Flemington
on Melbourne Cup day. Ruling Light
belongs to W. T. Hazlett, a sportsman who
saw the Chief Ruler mare win at Flem-

ington and subsequently returned to M.L.
Preston, the rider of Ruling Light, was
suspended for three months for having
crossed the field too sharply. Preston is
apprenticed to Harry Telford, of Phar
Lap fame.
Titan, after being sold as a two-year-
old for 4600gn5., involved E. G. Brod-
ribb in heavy loss by repeated failures ;
but in new ownership he recovered form
at a later stage and won several good
races when trained by James Scobie at
Ballarat. History appears to be repeating
itself in the case of Dominant. This son
of Saltash was bought by a syndicate
of sportsmen as a yearling for 6750gns.
Original owners burnt their financial
fingers over the transaction. Now raced
by Joseph Fell, of the V.A.T.C. com-
mittee, Dominant went out favorite for
the Welter Plate at Moonee Valley and
staged a one-act victory. His backers
were lucky, as Casque d’Or came from
the clouds to finish less than a length
behind Dominant.
J. M. Niall, of the V.R.C. committee,
has met with poor encouragement in his
effort to make a jumper out of Umber-
tana. Umbertana started at 5 to 4 for the
Hurdle Race at the Valley, but he clouted
one obstacle after another and whipped-in
the field. First place went to Cello-
hurst, who is owned and trained by Pat
Kelly, a brother-in-law of Mick Poison.
Moonee Valley meeting was in aid of
the V.R.C. Benevolent Fund. It received
strong support from members of the
V.R.C. committee as horseowners. Philip
Russell, a veteran member of the com-
mittee, captured a division of the Welter
Purse with Savate, by Great Star —Har-
riet Graham. In 1917 Russell carried off
the Australian Cup with Harriet Graham,
a mare that he imported from England.
* * * *
A.J.C. committeeman Hunter White
was present at Moorefield to see Nipper
(2 to 1 on) and Artful Clare (2 to 1), two
of his breeding, win the first and second
divisions of the Juvenile. Nipper is raced
on lease by Jamieson, who has thus won
two races in succession with the brother
to The Doctor’s Orders. Artful Clare car-
ries Hunter White’s own colors ; she is
a neat brown filly by High Art from Mal-
vina, who was a smart two-year-old.
Tatyoon —bred by Rosehill-trainer
Booth, named after his property at
Canowindra and raced in the colors of
Mrs. Booth and Miss Dot Booth —was
too brilliant for the opposition in the
first division of the Flying Welter. Start-
ing favorite at fours, Tatyoon, a typical
welter candidate, cleared out in the
straight to win from Happyendo (15 to 1)
and the consistent Questionnaire.
Prowler’s withdrawal from the Moore-
field Handicap pointed to 11-year-old
Royal Tune (5 to 1) having an excellent
chance, but Regal Star started favorite.
Darby Munro was seen at his best on the
old Greenstead gelding ; timing his run,
he got up in the last stride to win. by
half a head, with Dilemma a good third.
The Victorian Sanballat was a quiet tip,
but after pulling hard in the early stages
was beaten a long way from home.
Royal Tune looks so well that he may
record the hat trick at his next start.
Minister Jack Dunningham made no
mistake with his Magpie mare Astute (5
to 2) in the second division of the Flying
Welter. With Hall Mark’s pilot O’Sulli-
van in the saddle, Astute came fast in
the last furlong to win comfortably from
Celtic and Alantis, who are trained at
Moorefield. It was thought that Astute
would turn out a stayer ; and perhaps
she will yet.
* * * *
Nardale (5 to 1) has a liking for the
Moorefield track, but Barrier King was
the popular pick for the first division
of the Three- and Four-year-old. Nar-
dale soon got to the front, and won easily
from Raleigh and the unbacked Milan-
theon, who is in the Villiers. In the second
division Narbethong (evens) scored nar-
rowly from The Pinch and Kowulka.
Scone pastoralist Albert Tanner pro-
duced Opulent in fine trim for the
Kogarah Stakes. The Promised Land
gelding was made favorite at fours. He
put up a really good performance to win
from Cordova and Fairoic. Badly placed
early, he was under pressure over the last
half-mile, and never flinched in a tight
finish. By piloting Red Shadow (3 to
1) to victory in the Carlton Mile Ted
Bartle made his score three; he had
ridden Opulent and Nipper.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Australian Joe Dawson proved dis-
tinctly superior to Walter Browning at
Leichhardt, though much the lighter man.
He was a mile ahead on points up to the
fourth round; then, putting plenty of
pressure on a reverse arm-bar, he scored
the first fall with a forward slam. Brown-
ing lay on the mat groaning for many
seconds. He fought viciously in the fifth,
and evened the falls with a Boston crab
in the sixth. But the Aussie was awarded
a very popular decision.
Ins ancf Outs
The Sheffield Shield game between
Queensland and Victoria at Brisbane
began with a surprise for the visitors,
who failed to get rid of the supposedly
weak home side until it had piled up 349,
helped a bit by bad Victorian fielding,
Brew topped the scores with 102, and his
opening partnership with Allen (36)
brought 118 up for the first wicket. Tallon,
Yeates, Tait and Wyeth added over 100
for the last three wickets, Tait getting 61.
Fleetwood-Smith and Alexander each got
three expensive wickets—Ebeling’s con-
tribution was 1-89. Further shocks fol-
lowed when Oxenham sent back Wood-
full, Ponsford (55) and O’Brien for 100.
He then had 3 for 19. At the tea
adjournment on Monday, however, Vic-
*? ria „i^l SCOred 481 (Darli " S B 6) f ° r

Tenth Slip : Cricket has a long his-
tory of casualties. One of the most un-
usual in the chronicles comes recently
from India. A stumper in a Central India
match was standing well back to a fast
bowler. The trundler hit the stumps so
hard that one of the bails knocked out
the ’keeper’s eye, while at the same time
the steel-shod wicket, turning end over
end, pierced his chest, with the result that
the unfortunate lad died soon after.

“Long Leg”: Maoriland has asked the
Board of Control for an Australian team
to tour the Shivery Isles from February 2
to April 4. The selection of the eleven
for England will happen just before the
first date, and until that is done there
can be no nominations for the trans-
Tasmap trip. The board has asked the
All Blacks whether they will be content 10

All Blacks, there should be an enjoyable
tour for the rejects from the Exodus to
England.

“Bramall Lane”: A lot of fuss is being
made about the dependency of many of
the English counties on an Australian
Eleven tour of Britain—it is their meal
ticket, so to speak. That isn’t the opinion
of Yorkshire, the county’s annual report
pointing out that tours of this kind upset
the county season and usually bleed
Yorkshire of her best cricketers, t
away for the Tests. But the Tykes can
chuck a stiffer chest than most of ti
contemporaries. They raked in £12,705

Australia won the first tennis Test with
England at Sydney by 9 rubbers ?2 sets
185 games to 3 rubbers, 12 sets and 145
games—a more emphatic victory than
the most optimistic barracker had ex-
pected, especially after Crawford sue-
cumbed to Lee on the second day. The
champion made amends on Saturday by
downing Perry. Losing the first set, he
finished in a most determined fashion.
Crawford was also off his game in the
first doubles, in which he and McGrath
lost to Perry and Wilde. After that he
was himself again, Hughes and Lee going
down to the Australian combination on
Saturday. Hopman, though beaten by
Perry, won his other singles match against
Lee and showed splendid form in the
doubles with Quist. Quist and McGrath
each won his singles matches, the oppo-
nents in each case being Wilde and
Hughes, and in the doubles made an
even deeper impression. These boys have
been improved out of sight by their Davis
Cup tour.

Ins and Outs
With the Sheffield Shield matches last-
ing until the end of January, it is betting
long to tip the next Australian XI at
this juncture. The second benefit-trial
match in Sydney has given a faint idea
of what its composition may be. The
Rest beat N.S.W. with a sporting knock
of 409 on the last day, Woodfull (129)
replying to Kippax’s fine shot of 111 in
the second innings of N.S.W. (closed at
4-390). The four left-handers on The
Rest’s list did their best performances in
the two matches (O’Brien 44, Darling 77,
Nitschke 76 and Bromley 42). The re-
cognised bowlers of both sides failed to
impress—Kippax (3-10) came out with
the best performance and average.
The games have only disclosed three
possibilities for selection among what we
may call the unknowns. Barnett, of Vic-
toria, proved himself a class left-hand bat
in addition to a capable wicketkeeper.
Ebeling, of Victoria, bowled so well
throughout the trials that his chances
cannot be dismissed. Neither can those
of the forcing left-hander Rowe, of N. S.
Wales. Chilvers’s slows were good in
patches, and he was badly let down by
the fieldsmen, especially those in the slips.
Australia will have to bank chiefly on
the old brigade. A possible 16 are Wood-
full, Ponsford, Bradman, Richardson,
Darling, O’Brien, Bromley, Rowe,
McCabe, Wall, O’Reilly, Ebeling, Grim-
mett, Ironmonger, Oldfield and Barnett.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: Test-match propaganda
is already on the air. A cable from Eng-
land tells me, as I am writing this, that
a new bowling demon has been dis-
covered in the Old Dart. His name is
Nye, and he has confessed to having
spent several years in, the Australian
bush, where he practised “with stick
wickets and wooden bats,” the modern
steel, rubber-tyred variety of bat having
been, apparently, unknown to his rustic
intelligence. When he returned to Eng-
land “he bowled so fast that he was
always hurting somebody.” After that,
it is not surprising to hear that London
“Evening News” has declared that he
will be “as good as Larwood.”
* * * *
“Five Ways”: Queensland has pro-
duced something new in wicketkeepers.
This is a 16-year-old lad from Bundaberg
named Tallon. When he was 14 he came
to Brisbane for the country week tourney
and flabbergasted the old hands with his
uncanny ability. The Queensland selec-
tors told him he would have to stand
down a bit until his hands got set. Now
they are satisfied that this has happened,
for they have dropped that good per-
former Leeson in his favor. Only about
sft. 6in., he is something of a batsman
in addition to his ’keeping, and Alan
Kippax, who saw him while touring
Queensland a year or so ago, rates him
as a cricketer of first-water promise.
* * * *
“How’s That?”: Hans Ebeling has
taken some time to realise the promise
which he showed in 1922 with Caulfield
(Vic.) Grammar School. His first trial
with the Melbourne C.C. was in that
year, when he played with the first eleven
and the V.C.A. included him (though he
was only 18) in its team against Mary-
borough. He got two wickets very
cheaply, and when he commenced the
1923 season in great style many hailed
him as a coming successor to Gregory
and McDonald. Business has kept him
from inter-State cricket, except at occa-
sional intervals. For this reason he had
come to be regarded as just a useful
club bowler.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Tamornie” : Coincidence was working
overtime when one of the foursomes in
the Legacy Club’s day out teed off at
Doncaster (Vic.) links. The first player
pushed out her tee shot and struck a
player in the preceding foursome who
was searching for a ball in the rough ;
it landed on his hat. While he was
pointing out the position of the ball, the
second player hit off and dropped him.
Old Nick was on the job, and the third
player’s drive clean knocked out the
caddie with the human target who had
already been struck twice.
* * * *
“Brassey”: Australia is becoming so
dotted with golf courses that soon the
average wayfarer will leap to safety as
energetically at the cry of “fore” behind
him as he does to-day at the toot of a
motor-horn. One of two new courses
about to blossom into existence is a
£lO,OOO proposition on Sydney Harbor’s
North Head, where once was the quaran-
tine station. W. Corry, well known in
the world of golf, has laid the proposal
before the Manly Council. In Victoria,
the Forests Commission has been asked
for a permissive grant of 70 acres in
the Olinda forest, which was some time
ago cleared by fires and not replanted.
The applicants are undertaking not to
interfere with existing trees or to hamper
the authorities in the work of reafforesta-
tion, while the latter would have the right
to resume the area at any time.
* * * * i
Killara (N.S.W.) golf club, which has
built itself a lordly pleasure house to
replace that destroyed some time ago by
fire, has wetted the new building in pre-
scribed form. Old members eulogised the
younger entry, and the juniors came back
with heartfelt tributes to the spadework
done by the men of long ago, without
which the club would have died untimely
in infancy. The new clubhouse is the
last word in the completeness of its equip-
ment for the comfort of members, and
the beauty of the outward design is re-
peated within doors. The associates have
been specially well looked after. Their
decorative quarters even include a direct
telephone communication with the bar.
* H: * H=
“Cash Amateur”: The announcement
that Bobby Jones is returning to com-
petitive golf has revived the question of
his amateur status. In Yankeeland Bobby
is a pro., under a ruling which visits
disqualification on any amateur lending
his name to advertisement for pay as
the author of books or pictures dealing
with golf which are not really written
or composed by him. Bobby’s famous
talkie on golf has brought him under this
law, which does not exist in St. Andrew’s
list of verboten things. Thus it looks as
if Bobby remains an amateur throughout
the Empire, wherein the St. A. laws of
golf follow the British drumbeat round
the world.
Racquet and Bawl
“Top Spin”: The good start of the
Australians on the opening day of the
first tennis Test with England in Sydney
—all three singles were won by Quist,
McGrath and Hopman before the first
check was administered by Perry and
Wilde beating Crawford and McGrath
in the doubles —was neutralised when the
word went round that the medicoes had
told Crawford he must stay out of the
second and third Tests. His absence will
mean a lot to Australia’s hope of win-
ning the rubber, though he certainly
would be all the better for a rest. In the
second Test, which starts in Brisbane on
December 14, Gar Moon will replace the
champion.
* * * *
“Cut Shot”: An almost unprecedented
recovery was made by Harry Hopman in
his Test match with Lee in Sydney. In
the third and deciding set he was down
five games and 15-40 on his own service.
From this apparently hopeless position he
went on to win the game and six more in
succession, taking the set and match. Only
a pony to look at, Hopman is none the
less in the Poitrel class where tennis
is concerned.
* * • # *
“Farceur”: Most of the tennis teams
to visit Australia of late years have pro-
vided an element of the comic—usually
unconsciously in most cases. Ellsworth
Vines’s muttered arguments with him-
self during a hard game have hitherto
been accorded the bun, but the facial
contortions of Wilde are threatening his
supremacy. Wilde’s quaint habit of puffing
up his cheeks like the frog in the fable
and then letting the imprisoned air go
with a loud puff of satisfaction was the
most popular feature of an attractive
turn at his first Sydney appearance.

“Baseline”: The English tennis players
are this week playing at Dubbo in the
course of a roundabout journey to
Queensland. The visitors are showing a
tendency to depart from the official pro-
gramme where this is possible, and have
consented to visit Newcastle. This will
be some time in January after the short
tour of Tasmania, but actual dates have
yet to be fixed.
“Fitzcray”: Secretary Treloar, of the
Australian L.T.A., released the news the
other night that Australia’s whack of the
profits from the last Davis Cup series
would be a shade under £4OO. Figures
from various countries had yet to come in
but the amount quoted was practically
O.K. In future the L.T.A. will provide
its own insurance against rain. For
championships and Test matches a
deduction will be made equal to the
premium on a policy of £5OO against 10
points of rain within specified hours.
This should build up a fund from which
future insurances will be met.
Car and Cycle
“Whizz”: One of the miracles of
modern motoring is the tremendous
speed attainable by the small-car types
which British designers first put on the
market. Malcolm Campbell, with a
special car of 2300 h.p., has set the
world’s figures at 272.11 m.p.h. At Mont-
lhery a midget consisting of a prepared
Austin 7 chassis with a streamlined body
which was a miniature of that on Mal-
colm’s big car, put up averages of close
on two miles a minute for distances up
to 10 miles, that being covered at a rate
of 119.19 m.p.h. This car, with its four-
cylindered engine of 747 c.c., as com-
pared with Campbell’s huge 12-cylinder
Rolls Royce job, had only one-three-
hundredth the horse power.

“C.Q.”: Victorian light-car owners are
busy preparing their vehicles for the
Phillip Island 100, which comes off on
New Year’s Day. This event has be-
come the mainstay of the island muni-
cipality, even more so than the native
bears. The course has been steadily im-
proved, and there is better accommoda-
tion for the swarms of sightseers and for
the motorists who have to transport their
cars across from Stony Point to Cowes.
This time there will be seven prizes, and
the qualifying laps will be run off on
Monday morning, the day of the race, to
save competitors having to come across
the previous Saturday.
“Fitzcray”: The Phillip Island 100 will
be supplemented on January 30 by the
Grand Prix for motor-cycles. This event
was originally set down for the Bathurst
(N.S.W.) circuit, but the Phillip Island
shire president, A. K. Sambell, threw in
a hundred of the best to be added to the
prize-money, provided the fixture was
shifted to Victoria. The races will be
100 miles senior and junior, 75 miles
lightweight and 50 miles sidecar.
* * * =N
“Kick Starter”: We may look for
something extra-special in motor-cycle
speed records soon if Claude Temple
is right. Henne holds world figures
for the mile with 147.30 m.p.h.,
riding an air-cooled twin. Temple
thinks that cannot be beaten by a
similar type of engine, and he is de-
signing a water-cooled six-cylinder job
to do the trick. With the twin, says
Temple, cylinder diameter is so great
that the heat cannot be carried off
rapidly enough from the middle of the
piston, with the result that trouble is in-
evitable. With the small-diameter cylin-
ders of a six, the problem does not arise,
and power can be obtained which is
right outside the capacity of any twin
engine.
* * * *
“Sprocket”: A good pedal-pushing
performance, and one of more utility
to the community than spinning round
a circular track, was put up by two Perth
boys, Read and Gordon, who finished
up in Martin-place, Sydney, a few days
ago, after shoving a tandem bike across
Australia for 22 days. But for bad luck
with punctures they would have cut their
time considerably—as it was their figures
beat the previous best for a tandem by
four days and five hours. After a spell,
the pair will ride back as far as Adelaide,
taking the steamer there for the rest of
the trip home.
Miscellaneous
“Glenelg”: Adelaide is getting set for
the ninth Australian bowling tourney,
which will blossom towards the end of
the season. The jamboree is held turn
about in the Australian capital cities,
and Adelaide’s turn has been the first
for 12 long years. Organisation is afoot
already, and most of the 30,000 bowlers
who are reputed to devote the St. Mar-
tin’s summer of their years to rolling flat-
tened projectiles from one end of a
lawn to the other, and then going over
to what the golfers call “the 19th” for
“another,” are expected to be there.
* * * *
“Shrewsbury”: Rowing men in Eng-
land are keenly interested in an experi-
ment by a Southampton boat-building
firm which has turned out a steel racing
four for one of the local clubs. If the
ciaft proves successful, it is likely that
there will be a change-over from wood
to steel, since the latter is practically in-
destructible compared with the paper-
thin cedar shells. When metal was sub-
stituted for wood in sailing-ships, the old
hands said it would prove to lack the
“life” which marked the famous wooden
fliers. The opinion was repeated when
the racing yachts followed suit, but in
each case the old brigade was wrong.
* * * *
“Shell”: An interesting bit of un-
authorised arrogance was exhibited the
other day when the British Sculling
Board wrote to Bobby Pearce announc-
ing that he had no right to claim the
world’s championship after beating Ted
Phelps at Toronto, because the conditions
of the race hadn’t been approved by the
board. The so-styled board made no
attempt to interfere with the race
beforehand, and what brought it to
life no one seems to know. I
am personally in accord with the
contention that the race should not
be regarded as a world’s championship.
It was rowed with a turn, and long cus-
tom has demanded that the title which
Australia monopolised for so many years
should be rowed for over a straight pull
of at least three miles. Otherwise, the
reply to the alleged board is a raspberry.
* * *
“Birkenhead Park”: When The Bul-
letin, at the end of the last football
season, tipped Jan McShane, of Sydney
Uni. and N.S.W., to succeed his fellow-
Welshman and Rhodes scholar “Butts”
Lamport behind the Oxford scrum, it
picked a winner. Eight weeks after Jan
left Sydney for Oxford he was given his
blue for the clash with Cambridge, a
record of its kind. He had only one
preliminary gallop in the Freshmen’s
trials, but that seems to have been enough
for the Dark-Blue selectors.


A GALLERY OF GOLFERS.
No. 16.
Commonwealth Club Chaps.
Commonwealth is something of a pup
as Australian imitations of St. Andrews
go. L. J. Wright, C. J. Wild and a few
others were responsible for its start some-
where about 1917. The young show set
in at Waverley—the Melbourne, not the
Sydney, locality of that name, please—
and soon found it needed elbow-room.
Four years later scouts picked on an
area close to the Metropolitan club’s
course at Oakleigh. The ground was a
real wilderness then. Hard-working and
efficient committees deserve all credit for
developing the club and its course to first
rank among its Victorian relatives.
Charles Lane, captain for many years,
should get the hardest pat on the back
for good and unselfish work done for
Commonwealth. In 1926 he put all else
aside to make a tour of British golf
courses. The knowledge he gained
abroad is embodied in the Common-
wealth’s course to-day, full as it is of
subtleties and problems from a golf
architect’s point of view, and of incen-
tives to the average golfer to improve
his game if he doesn’t want to be per-
manently ranked in the dud class.
The eagle-visaged bird gazing into the
far horizons is Frank Roper, one of Com-
monwealth’s most ardent supporters. He
is on a longish mark, but the fact that
he never wins championships for his club
fails to shake his conviction that there is
no other club that matters. Listed second
is J. Northfield, mostly known as “Silent
Jim” because he never uses two words
when one will do. He is an artist, and
considers that professional etiquette
might have induced Frith to have shown
him a little more mercy.
A. J. Ahern is just as affable as he
looks in the drawing, and the fact
that he is a medico has enabled
him to prescribe for many golfing
ills. It has been said that one mem-
ber he handled at the 19th after he had
taken 17 to get out of a sand bunker
actually got home without kicking the
cat at the front gate.
F. C. Wray is manager of Craig, Wil-
liamsons. He is one of those carefree
golfers who extol the game as the only
thing in life worth following—which is
all very well for him; he is right out
on the front mark in the handicaps.
H. G. Adams, who follows, is the
newly-elected president. He is one of
the heads on Melbourne “Herald” and
a pretty useful golfer, as his 9 handi-
cap suggests. J. G. Grainger, coming
after his president, somewhat resembles
Bobby Jones —he wears the same shaped
specs. As a golfer he has some way to
go yet to live up to the picture, having
an 18 handicap. He is a committeeman,
and off the fairway and out of the rough
is manager of Hooper and Harrison.
The pleasant-looking lad whose coif-
fure suggests that he has been experi-
menting with a reafforestation scheme
is Henry, the hotel broker. His immacu-
late attire suggests Savill-row, but he
does not let his immaculateness get in
the way of playing a hot game off 10.
The sardonic-looking gentleman with
the “What th’ do I care?” smile is
Bill Wheildon, manager of Stained Glass
Windows. He has never handed in a
card, and has never won a com-
petition. His ambition is to drive from
the tee over one bunker on the course —
only one. That accomplished, he is
credited with being ready to sing the
“Nunc dimittis” at the 19th.
E. C. Dixon, who comes next, is one
of Commonwealth’s oldest members, and

The obvious wag in the Fair Island
pullover is the life of the Commonwealth
party. Willis by name, he is a con-
firmed mirthmaker with a tendency to
make impertinent references to the han-
dicaps of his fellows. With the grim
smile and the pompadour, behold J. C.
Gamble, a director of Vacuum Oil. He
is an ardent student of golf literature,
and is not such a dusty performer
off 15.
Harry Tarr has the unlucky 13 num-
ber—or the lucky one, as you prefer,
He had a good deal to do with Com-
monwealth’s winning of the 1933 senior
pennant. C. L. Glew is, naturally, known
in ?h niCkna t m t-’ f T h£ a
dour fighter with a reputation for saving
his game on the last green. J. J. Ray-
I s u . motorist ail j- a
golfei to boot, with a 10 handicap. C.
Lane lias already been referred to. He
has abandoned golf temporarily for
sheep-tarming.
Last is secretary Syd Morpeth. A
distinguished Maoriland player, he came
to Australia three years ago, joining up
with Commonwealth in 1930. Since then
he has been a leading figure in big golf
on this side the Tasman,
.. Sandringham ... xhe L . au . has been
accumulating a stocking with a view
to financing the dispatch of a team to
Maoriland or even the importation of
* party of British women golfers! There
is said to be a fair sum socked away,
and it is now proposed that affiliated
dabs shall, at a time to be decided, con-
duct a co^lpetition on their own ’ link3i
forwarding the scores to the L.G.U. The
bes t score will win a cup, and the profits
-will go to the union’s coffers,

“Hoylake”: Enid Wilson has been
knocking back a proposal to curtail the
British women’s championship final to 18
holes of stroke. She shows herself a stout
supporter of the Australian system—a
qualifying round of match play, with 36
holes of medal for the players left in.
The lad Y claims that this checkmates
the fluker who plays wonderful golf
over a few holes, only to crack up as she
gp es on - That is precisely the idea be-
hind the Australian system.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
THE
STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
THE NASAL GRUB.
“Jumbuck”: The sheep bot has made
its presence felt of late in Queensland
coastal districts. Owing to the position
the hatched grub takes up the trouble
is harder to dislodge than either the
horse bot or the ox-warble. The sheep
botfly lays its eggs close to the nostrils
of the sheep, and when hatched the grub
works its way into the nasal chamber.
The presence of a few grubs will make
a sheep lose its condition rapidly.
An injection of turpentine and
glycerine up the nostrils will dislodge
the grubs, but preventive measures are
best. Smear the nostrils with whale oil
or tar to prevent the fly from settling.
Place the salt or other lick in troughs
with a covering lid bored with two-inch
holes. Smear round the holes with tar
or oil, and the sheep cannot get a lick
without being smeared where the bot
lays its eggs. Tar or oil will not prevent
the sheep from having a lick, and those
that do will be immune from attack.
CLASSING THE CLIP.
“Golightly”: A breeder of extra-fine
merinos on the Southern Tablelands
(N.S.W.) didn’t employ a woolclasser for
his 30,000 clip. He was approached by a
young friend who offered to get up his
clip for a reference only. The owner
brought along a stud ewe fleece and a
ration wether fleece, asking how much
more the stud’s wool would fetch per
pound. He was staggered when he was
assured that the wether fleece would
bring pence per pound more on the sale
floor but that the ewe’s fleece was of
the greater commercial value.
A well-known wool traveller boasted
that he could so class any average clip
that its top line would bring more than
the neighboring clips. He did, too, by
understanding and specialising in yield.
“Murrawong”: “Sheepo” has a poor
opinion of woolclassers generally when
he denies the ability of more than 1 p.c.
to “divide the clip into parcels, each for
some particular branch of the textile
trade,” and claims that it would take
a qualified sorter to do the job (B.
22/11/’33). Every reputable classer I
know is a qualified sorter. I meet most
of the well-known woolmen in N.S.W.,
where the shearing season lasts only five
or six months. The average classer
spends the balance of the year, or as
much of it as possible, in city repacking
stores.
Uniform quality is not the rule in
average fleeces, but can be attained. I
could name one Riverina clip whose
owner, by careful breeding to a definite
standard and rigorous culling, has estab-
lished a flock nearly even in quality.
When the fleeces are skirted and the
backs removed, the classer has the
material for lines of fleece that no sorter
would try to improve on. But the credit
belongs to the breeder. Sorting in the
shed will improve the get-up of most
clips, but it is not final. The mill sorters
still have to handle all wools before
manufacture, whether they are sorted or
classed. The first step in economical
handling rests with the breeder.
UNGRADED WOOL.
“Mouton”: Slovenly marketing methods
are adopted by many farmers. Un-
graded clips include rotten, earthy, wasty
backs, and at the same time quite a large
percentage of good sound spinning wool.
Governments and fruitgrowers recognise
the necessity for the correct grading and
packing of dried fruits. Yet wool may
be marketed in any old way. If only
rough grading —the separation of the
tender, wasty, earthy sort from the sound
spinning sorts —were done, farmers would
receive something like value for types
of wool which are bought cheap by
scouring and dealing firms.
FOOLPROOF EARMARKS.
“Sheepo”: “Wen” (B. 1/11 /’33) is cor-
rect when he says that earmarks on
sheep cannot be considered a positive
means of identification. There are too
many owners for the limited number of
registered marks available. The Brands
Department does its best to see that ear-
marks are not duplicated in the same
district. But what about the owner who
buys sheep in another district with an
earmark similar to that of one of his
neighbors? The law will not allow the
ear containing the registered mark to
be mutilated.
It often happens in Queensland that
two or more owners in the same district
will have some sheep of the one earmark.
Tar or fluid brands as a positive means
of ownership won’t count in court.
The registered mark, coupled with a
fluid brand that will last in the wool
until shearing, and placed in a certain
portion of the sheep, should be suffi-
cient proof of ownership. A lot of
unnecessary trouble would be obviated
if owners had their earmarks put in
carefully.
FARM AREAS.
“Jass”: “El V.’s” sweeping statement
(B. 15/11/’33) that “Australian farm
areas are too big” is true, but it may
be challenged by those who blame the
smallness of their blocks for their in-
ability to make good. The large-area
man is part farmer and part miner. In
good seasons the pasture grows rank and
is burnt off. A little fertility is returned
in the ash, but most goes up in smoke.
The plant foods taken from the soil must
be replaced or the land is soon mined
of its wealth. In livestock farming much
of the fertility can be returned to the soil
by farmyard manure. This is only done
where it is properly conserved and sys-
tematically distributed.
The nature of the pasture has much
to do with fertility. Legumes (lucerne,
clovers, peas, beans) can draw their nitro-
gen from the atmosphere. As nitrogen
is an essential ingredient of all proteins,
the economy of growing legumes is obvi-
ous. A good burn-off gets rid of a lot
of rubbish in the form of insect and
other pests, but it also destroys the
organic matter (i.e., humus) without
which no soil can be cropped success-
fully. No artificial fertiliser can give
good results unless the soil contains
enough humus. Where insect pests are
not present, it is usually better to plough
in decaying pasture than to burn it off.
It is wasteful to grow a leguminous crop,
such as cowpeas or soya beans, and
burn it.
A small block, with good stock and
systematic pasture improvement, will
always return more than one twice as
big with double the number of “scrub-
bers,” and will do it at lower capital and
maintenance cost. The ideal area will
naturally vary with the man and the
locality.
IMPROVEMENT OF ROUGH
GRAZING.
“Hatter”: Experiments to improve
rough pastures, undertaken by the plant-
breeding station in Wales, proved inter-
esting. Apart from areas of a decidedly
boggy nature which were not dealt with,
rough grazing may be of three distinct
types:
(1) The agrostic-fescue heath and mountain
pastures.
(2) The mat-weed or nardus pastures.
(3) The flying-bent or molinia pastures.
Grasses that grow slowly (nardus, bent
and sheep’s fescue) are only palatable
when very young. This applies particu-
larly to nardus, which is worthless even
on a sheeprun. Molinia is only slightly
better, as it runs away so quickly in the
spring that it is of little use to sheep.
Bent and sweet vernal are superior in the
scale of values, and Yorkshire fog. ranks
higher still.
It was established that very close
grazing by sheep or drastic defoliation
by cutting tended to a gradual increase
of fescue and bent and to a reduction
in molinia. Where seed and adequate
fertilisers were supplied, however, the
sward quickly improved. Whatever
method of cultivation was employed no
satisfactory result was in any case ob-
tained without adequate manqres, though
the comparatively light dressing of Lfewt.
basic slag and lcwt. or even less of nitro-
chalk gave a highly satisfactory seeding.
Super, would probably yield as good
results in this country as the basic slag,
but the substitution of sulphate of am-
mctiia for nitro-chalk gave a striking
illustration of the different reaction of
fescue and bent to the two manures:
S. of a. with phosphates: Bent, 9 p.c.;
sheep’s fescue, 49 p.c.; molinia, 33 p.c.
Nitro-chalk with phosphates: Bent, 76 p.c.;
sheep’s fescue, 15 p.c.; molinia, 5 p.c.
And, generally speaking, bent is the
most useful grass to encourage.
When better grasses, such as cocksfoot
or crested dog’s-tail, are desired, it may
be necessary to plough ; but “scratching”
is sufficient to establish wild white clover
and Yorkshire fog where the moisture
content is adequate. The scratching must
be either light or thorough. In the first
case, the mat must be sufficiently dis-
integrated to allow the seed and manure
to penetrate to the underlying vegetation.
If given sufficient moisture, clover seeds
will flourish. If the mat is hacked to
pieces and the vegetation destroyed, the
ground below must be in a sufficiently
“arable” condition to cover the clover
seeds with soil. Clovers require more
moisture for germination than grasses,
but the latter require a more earthy seed-
bed.
In one instance a suitable condi-
tion for sowing was brought about by
dragging the trunks of trees, wound
round with wire-rigging rope, across the
rough pastures in wet weather. Besides
breaking down the coarse growth, a cer-
tain amount of levelling of the land was
accomplished by this primitive cultiva-
tor, and a good seeding resulted, soil
having been brought to the surface.
, POTATO CROPS.
“Spud”: The belief of many Victorian
potato-growers that potash as a fertiliser
supplementary to super, and amm. sulph.
was essential to produce increased yields
has been exploded by manurial trials con-
ducted by Vic. Agriculture Department.
In plots in such widely separated parts
as Wheatsheaf, Koroit, Warragul, Mill-
brook and Romsey, potash invariably
produced a depression in yield, the aver-
age reduction being almost 12cwt. per
acre. Super, and amm. sulph. applied
without potash as a “3 -t- 1” mixture,
however, with rare exceptions, produced
the highest marketable yield.
CORKY SCAB IN POTATOES.
“Hatter”: Corky scab appears in its
mild form as rough scabs or small coni-
cal pimples on the skin of the tuber, but
when more severe the flesh of the potato
is destroyed and a canker-like appear-
ance supervenes. The cells of the tuber
decay, and the spore-balls of the parasite
are set free and are visible under a lens
as a brown powder. The plant also
develops small root galls which do not
seriously affect its growth but contami-
nate the soil. No practical way of disin-
fecting the soil has so far been dis-
covered, and the only remedy is a long
rotation to starve the disease out. It
may retain its power of infection for
three years, so probably five years or
more would be required to clean it. In
England 6fewt. flowers of sulphur per
acre has been found helpful, but sulphur
here is at a prohibitive price.
infection is carried from one area to
another mainly by the distribution and
planting of affected tubers. Those
marked with any kind of scab should
not be used for seed. Sound seed from
infected soil can be safely used if dis-
infected by steeping for three hours in a
weak solution of formalin (li pints for-
malin to 15 gallons water).
Corky scab appears in its worst form
in wet districts and in ill-drained soil.
The presence of an excess of lime aggra-
vates the disease. In districts such as
the west of Ireland, where soil and
climate are favorable, it is less prevalent
in dry Reasons.
Chief points to observe in dealing with
it are: (1) Any improvement in the
drainage of the land is beneficial. (2)
Don’t use lime. (3) Take care not to
spread the disease by the use of infected
seed, manure or implements. Thousands
of spores are produced by a single plant,
and these move through the wet soil and
come in contact with the tubers.
LEARN FROM THE POULTRY-
FARMER.
“Bahb Dwyer”: The dairy-farmer can
learn a lot by studying the methods of
the poultryman. Testing and culling go
on continuously in the hen-house, the ob-
jective always being more and larger
eggs, which are only obtainable from
high-class, vigorous stock. The tested
sire is also a feature of high-class poultry-
farming. The cautious breeder uses a
sire sparingly until some of his progeny
have actually proved that his good points
and no undesirable ones have been trans-
mitted.
The poultry-farmer concentrates on
egg-production. Though there may be
one or two sidelines, they are kept strictly
subservient. The dairy-farmer frequently
allows the sidelines, such as pig-raising
or baby beef, to assume too important a
place, resulting in neglect of butter pro-
duction.
Care of growing stock is the poultry-
man’s chief job, and so it should be the
dairyman’s. Feeding must be of the very
best in order that the young stock shall
develop the ability to produce the
maximum amount.
Where rigid culling is necessary, some-
thing is wrong with either breeding or
feeding, or both. Cull where necessary—
never persevere with a runt —but remem-
ber that in the ideal flock culling is
reduced to a minimum. The tested sire
furnishes the clue —the culling is really
done before.
CLEANING UP THE FARM.
“Eureka”: Dairy-farmers in N.S.W.
coastal districts allow old logs and
stumps to remain on property for years.
Their farms would carry more cows if
such were removed ; and it’s not hard.
One South Coast (N.S.W.) farmer
did great work with an auger and two
tins of gunpowder. He used , the timber
for firewood, posts, rails and slabs about
the farm. He dragged the logs to small
creeks and used them to dam aip suitable
places. These formed waterholes which
contain water long after the little creeks
cease to run.
Patches of blackberry-bush and
bracken fern can be removed with per-
severance. One farmer I know fenced
all patches of bracken and blackberry,
cut them down and burnt them and
planted oats. Certainly early crops were
more bracken and blackberry-bush than
oats, but eventually the pests were
beaten.

TENTER FI ELD 1873
B *N Kr
N EVV SOUTH WALES
At Tenterfield in 18/3
Sixty years ago, when the Bank of New
South Wales established its branch at
Tenterfield, wheat-growing was the main
occupation in that area.
To-day, Tenterfield serves one of the
soundest cattle-raising districts in New
South Wales. The well-watered western
portion of the district is devoted mainly to
sheep. Recently tobacco-growing was
successfully introduced.
In Tenterfield and throughout Australia
and New Zealand the Bank of New South
Wales has always provided complete
banking services to settlers and has thus
made an essential contribution to the
development of the natural resources of
these countries.
Bank of New South Wales
(ESTABLISHED 1817)
with which the Western Australian Bank and The Australian Bank
of Commerce Ltd. are amalgamated.
INOCULATING LUPIN SEED.
“Yeoman” : Many disappointments in
growing blue lupins may be due to failure
to inoculate the soil or the seed with the
lupin bacteria. Taking soil from a lupin
field and scattering it over a paddock
which is to be sown with lupins may be
practicable if one is handy to the other.
But when the distance is too great for
this to be done inoculate the seed this
way :
Get some fine soil from a pad-
dock in which lupins have grown well;
then mix sufficient sugar and water to
make a thick sticky syrup. Immerse the
seed in this syrup and while wet roll it
in the soil, which adheres. This trans-
fers sufficient bacteria to the new lupin
field, because they will multiply rapidly
and soon meet the requirements of this
legume.
Sow only the W.A. flat-seeded lupin.
It thrives best on sandy and calcareous
soils where the rainfall is from 14 to 18
inches. It survives frosts, likes a con-
genial climate and seems to do best in
coastal regions, although in W.A. it is
successfully grown inland. If lightly
grazed the first year a lupin field will
carry several sheep per acre thereafter.
For fattening purposes the lupin seed,
which the sheep feed on, has no superior
in the forage line. The blue lupin is
practically unknown in S.A. and Vic.,
although a few farmers are trying it
in a small way. In several instances the
experimenters sowed it too late. Early
autumn is the best time for seeding. And
if the inoculation of the seed, or soil, is
observed considerable areas in both States
could be sown down with this valuable
legume and a new source of profit opened
up to enterprising farmers.
WATER-SUPPLY CONTROL.
“Wen”: The value of controlled
water supply, even in the n.-w. N.S.W.
pastoral country, was shown clearly dur-
ing the recent inquiry at Moree into the
removal of the Raft on the Gwydir
River. Pioneers pointed out that, before
the floodwaters were diverted into other
channels, over 500,000 acres of water-
course land—now valuable sheep land —
was a morass covered with sags (Miranda
reeds) and water, in places stirrup-deep.
By regularly flooding the watercourse
small holdings have developed a carrying
capacity that is the envy of graziers in
drier parts. To send the Gwydir water
further west, it is suggested that channels
be cut below the Raft —a natural dam of
flood debris which started to form in 1889
through a tree falling across the channel.
It is now six miles in extent. The reopen-
ing of the Mehi, which used to be the
main river, and, perhaps, the damming
of the Gwydir are also considered neces-
sary to enable floodwaters to be used to
the best advantage.
ORCHARD SITUATIONS.
“Carben”: An orchard’s situation may
make £lOO per acre difference in the
return. If the aspect is right in regard
to the sun it will be found that land
with some slope is preferable to abso-
lutely flat land. Should the farm offer a
block bounded on the westerly side by
a well-wooded hill and a stream on the
opposite side you have a site for a most
profitable orchard. And orcharding is
still profitable under the right conditions,
but these do not exist in 90 out of 100
sites selected. See that the laying-out
does not crowd the trees, 30 to 40 feet
apart being better than 20.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Gumblegubbin”: Straining too tightly
in hot weather is the cause of many
broken wires found in fences. Wire
expands with the heat and contracts,
tightening, with the cold.
“Rotom”: To whiten the bails and
dairy, instead of using water stir up the
pipeclay or whiting with skimmed milk.
First add to the milk a little melted glue
or size. The whitewash, without any ap-
pearance of peeling or crumbling, will
last for months instead of looking shabby
in a few days.
“Pick”: For stockwhip handles, tools
or furniture made of river oak, myall or
spotted gum, make a simple but very
effective polish by mixing olive oil and
whiting to a thick paste. With succes-
sively finer grades of sandpaper, rub the
timber perfectly smooth. Then apply
the paste with a clean flannel, rubbing
constantly along the grain. Continue
the operation briskly for 45 minutes.
Then with a soft cloth or chamois leather
wipe away all whiting and oil.
“A.C.8.”: For a sowing board, get a
suitable piece of timber, about 4ft. long,
and bore holes every 2in. to accommo-
date wooden teeth which can be arranged
to give the distance wanted between
rows. By using the board to make the
drills the seed can be planted at the cor-
rect depth and the rows kept even. The
board may be attached to a long handle
if desired.
“Carben”: Do not plant out young
tobacco plants until they are quite thick
or stocky. If weather is at all dry, see
that water is placed in each hole a few
hours before transplanting. Firm the
plants in well. Sufficient room should be
left between rows to allow of horse culti-
bation and about Bin. between plants.
“A.C.8.”: Keep French beans well
hilled up ; they are less liable to disease.
Use a rake, holding it so that the soil
is thrown against the plants; chipping
with a hoe often destroys some of the
roots and checks the growth. Heavy
manuring will often cause disease in
beans. Burn all affected plants imme-
diately.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) Cause of orange-trees losing their young
fruit up to three or four months after the crop
has set ? (2) What steps can 1 take to over-
come this? —9011.
Information supplied is not very complete,
but it seems that the most likely cause is too
much water, which produces a vigorous flush of
sap just after the fruit has set. Carry out
watering two or three weeks before the blos-
soms appear, but do not apply it again until
the fruit is well set, and not in big quan-
tities until the fruits are fairly well developed.
(1) What is the correct ration per day (four
feeds) for medium draught-horses in farm work
(no pasture available, except two months in
spring) ? Feed available confined to good oaten
and wheaten hay, cut when the grain is just fully
formed, and milky, chaffed and crushed oats,
barley or wheat. (2) Value of molasses as an
addition ? (3) Would the horses, having very
little green pasture, require minerals, such as
phosphate of lime, added to the ration (sheep
and. cows do here) ? (4) Any preparation in
which balls of twine can be dipped to discourage
mice eating the hay bands of sheaves in stacks ?
—8853.
(1) A suggested ration is 131 b. of oats and 171 b.
of hay, but it is likely that the ration could be
made 101 b. of oats and 201 b. of hay, provided
the hay is of good quality. Considerable varia-
. tion is permissible, and the settler should use
his judgment and knowledge of the individual
horses as to the amounts that he feeds to each
one. Barley could be substituted for oats in
the same proportion. If wheat is fed, it should
be crushed and mixed with the chaff and fed
at first only in small quantities. (2) If the horses
are fed on the lines indicated there would be
no advantage in feeding molasses. It would,
however, increase the palatability of poor-
quality hay. (3) If the ration mentioned is fed
minerals are necessary. If, however, the horses
are restricted entirely to dry-grazing a phosphatic
lick would be beneficial. (4) Know of none.
1 want to send my boy (aged 14) to Hawkes-
bury Agri. College. What scholarships are avail-
able ? Please give details of the following: (1)
The McCaughey Bequest. I fulfil the condi-
tions re “returned-soldier” qualification. Does
this apply to disabled soldiers or sailors only ?
(2) The James Murphy scholarship for agricul-
tural education of R.C. boys. I understand my
boy is eligible for this. What are the educa-
tional qualifications? —BBBB.
Lads must be, at the opening of the first
session, not less than 16 years of age to start
the Agriculture Diploma Course, and not less
than 17 years for admission to the Dairy
Diploma Course. They must have the Inter-
mediate certificate (including English and mathe-
matics) issued by the Department of Education,
or its equivalent. Candidates for the college
scholarships and bursaries must be not less
than 16 years of age and not more than 19
years of age on date of the opening of the
first session, and must be natural-born or
naturalised subjects. They, or their parents,
must have had six months’ continuous residence
in N.S.W. immediately prior to opening of the
first session. (1) Applications are received
only from returned soldiers or sailors who
are in receipt of 100 p.c. pension or greater, on
behalf of their sons, or from sons of deceased
soldiers or sailors whose deaths were due to
war service. Further particulars are obtainable
from the Commissioner, Department of Repatri-
ation, Chalmers-street, Sydney. (2) James
Murphy bursaries are provided by the estate of
the late James Murphy for the sons of R.C.
parents whose means are, in the opinion of the
trustees, not enough to pay for the Dip
Agri. Course. Applications should be lodged
with the manager, Perpetual Trustee Co., Ltd
33-39 Hunter-street, Sydney, not later than
January 5 each year.
(1) After a Queensland shire council has
issued a certificate to a District Court authorising
the sale of land to pay arrears of rates, has the
council power to withdraw such land from the
Court ? If so, how ? (2) Has the Agricultural
Bank power to stop the sale being held other
than by paying arrears of rates ? (3) If the sale
is held, has the Agricultural Bank first claim on
the proceeds of the sale to the value of its
mortgage? (4 ) Can a ratepayer obtain protec-
tion against a shire council under the Mort-
gagors’ Relief Act ? If so, how ? —9069.
(1) The council has power to withdraw the
land from sale; it must notify the Court of its
intention. (2) Bank could apply for an in-
junction to restrain the council from selling land
subject to bank’s mortgage. (3) If sold, State
bank has priority of claim. (4) Act is not
applicable, there being no relationship of mort-
gagor and mortgagee between the parties.
I have been told that a motor-lorry owned
by a primary producer and used solely to cart
his produce to market is entitled to registration
at half the ordinary rate, and that a car used in
the same manner is charged for at the same
rate. Is this correct ? —9023.
Under the N.S.W. Motor Traffic Act it is
provided that the rate for a motor vehicle which
is the property of a farmer and is used solely
for the cartage of his produce and is not let
out on hire shall be at the rate of Is. 9d. per
half-cwt. of its weight. To obtain this con-
cession, application to the Department of Road
Transport, Sydney, is essential.
How big a silo would it take to hold the
quantity of wheat represented by putting two
grains on the first square of a draught-board,
four on the second, eight on the third, and so
on to the 64th ? —9114.
Depends to some extent on the size of the
wheat grains. Taking 800 to the cubic inch
(a very small sample), the silo would have to be
about 80 miles long, 27 miles wide and 220 ft.
high.

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
New Ireland Affairs
“Vic”: Somebody has been telling the
League of Nations that New Ireland is
demanding self-government. Minister
Marr says that the yarn is all moonshine,
and that when he visited New Ireland in
May everything was all right; “the
Administration is not weak, but strong
and sympathetic.” Marr’s visit took him
to Kaevieng, the capital, which sits on the
extreme tip of a 300-mile-long island,
and a little way down Bulowinski’s road,
which runs —with Australian additions —
190 miles or so into Namatanai district,
so that he is scarcely in a position to
judge from personal knowledge. How-
ever, the last report to the League shows
the island as being the only one in the
Bismarcks under complete administrative
control.
If the Administration has become
strong, it is only in recent years.
A few years ago, when I visited the place,
it was notoriously weak and rent by
quarrels, and the natives, who still re-
membered the iron German rule, showed
their sneaking contempt for it by their
insolence. They are the handsomest boys
in the Pacific when their hair is in the
white, frizzed stage, and are regarded as
Don Juans by other islanders. If they
made up their minds to be nasty they
could cause a lot of trouble, though they
are not so turbulent as the independent
Manus kanakas who drove the Govern-
ment police boys into the sea in 1920. In
the old German pioneering days New
Ireland, then Neu Mecklenburg, was the
venue of the German island song “Ein
Pflanzer auf ein Kiistenreis,” which pro-
bably shared with A. B. Paterson’s
“Waltzing Matilda” the honor of being
the most rollicking ditty ever invented in
the Southern Hemisphere.
“Old Mac”: “O’Coen” (B. 29/11/’33)
need not lose any sleep over those wild
tribes which a syndicate desires to take
to Melbourne to exhibit at the centenary
celebrations. Bleakley, the Protector of
Aboriginals, has put his foot down, and
says nobody will be allowed to ex-
ploit the untamed Binghi for gain or
make a show of him. If any niggers do go
south they will probably be gents, from
Yarrabah, more skilled in hymn-singing
than spear-throwing, or nicely-dressed
warriors from Palm Island, who will do
nothing more exciting than carve a few
bad boomerangs and sell an odd pearl-
shell.
* * * *
“Mataranka”: The air expedition
organised by the W.A. Mining Corp. to
explore the Kimberleys is nearly ready
to start. It is the most promising thing
of its sort which has been done, and it
should be able to bring back a fairly
accurate photographic map of part of
the Kimberleys and other country.
About 80,000 square miles will be
covered. The aeroplanes are the most
suitable which have been used in Aus-
tralia for this class of work —two D.H.D.-
Ms., which are so built as to give a
maximum field of vision. They have
been specially fitted for bad landings.
The chief picture-maker will be F. C. V.
Laws, at one time commandant of the
R.A.F. photographic school in London,
and he will have with him Snook, a well-
known Westralian pilot, and S. C. Camp-
bell, who flew Mawson’s ’plane in the
Antarctic. The pictures, taken from
10,000 to 15,000 feet, will not, of course,
show any gold lying about loose, but will
give a clear indication of the geology of
the country and of its water resources.
In S. Africa and Canada the scheme has
been highly successful.
* * * *
“Pneumo Ben”: Those Mt. Isa men will
have to put up a new tale before they
can hope for “victimisation” help from
Broken Hill miners. Their two victims
of a bowelless capitalism were sacked
for firing at the wrong time. On
the Barrier, for the same offence, it
would not be the co. but the miners’
union which would deal with them. But
Mt. Isa has not been going long enough
for the A.W.U. to have a “Red Roll, : ’
nor has it moving in its midst numbers
of compensation beneficiaries. These
lungers provide living and vivid lessons
of why the miners should be the first to
insist on smoke- and dust-free working
places. And such working places cannot
be obtained while men strike for the right
of firing at ail times ■ and so having thd
mine filled at all times with smoke and
dust.
* * * =t=
“Kaloa”: It isn’t only in flying that
the Mandated Territory sets up records.
Its non-indigenous population is 4336,
including 1215 Chinese. Asiatics last year
had an almost clean slate of major crime—
two convicted for forgery ; and there were
only four penal convictions among the
Europeans—one for murder, one for in-
decency, one for obtaining goods by false
pretences, and one for demanding pro-
perty with menaces. In the lower District
Courts the toll was heavier. One Euro-
pean in every 25 was convicted of some-
thing, but, as criminal action is taken
in cases of failing to pay wages or over-
time to natives, it is no wonder. One
Asiatic in every 13 seems to have fallen,
“Look at his hocks, boys Ain’t he the perfect stock horse?”
“How long has the poor cow bin in stock?”
but how the recruited native keeps
out of the calaboose at all is a marvel.
Almost everything he does except live is
punishable. He gets hauled before the
Court of Native Affairs for such crimes
as disobeying lawful orders to tend crops,
spreading false reports, enticing wife
from companionship of her husband,
adultery—and no wonder, since the poor,
bemused fellow doesn’t know what a
wedding is according to European ideas.
Refusing to be medically examined and
gambling both bring him within the
ambit of the law. But there is one awful
offence which a single villain committed
last year of which no civilised European
ever heard —especially in Manly and
Redcliffe: Unlawfully wearing clothing
on the upper part of the body !
* * * *
“Mulyan”: There are better ways of
finding a house on a dark night in the
bush than by coo-eeing. And it was very
dark when Kenny and I pulled up at a
wet gully on the road to Woodford (Q.).
We were out of tucker, and on a strange
track, but knew there were selectors
somewhere about. After shuffling around
and kicking against enough wood to
make a fire, Kenny turned his face sky-
wards and uttered a dismal dog-howl.
Nothing happened. “No dogs about,” he
commented ; and after a pause he assailed
the welkin with a loud “cock-a-doodle-
do.” In a few seconds, beyond a low
hill, we heard the answering crow of a
rooster. “There’s the house,” said Kenny ;
“ ’bout a mile from here.”
* * * *
“Wandi”: While Queensland maple
and walnut are now fashionable and
highly-valued timbers, I doubt if any
tree anywhere has ever reached the price
paid for red cedars. Some years ago a
mate of mine took up a selection on the
Atherton Tableland (N.Q.), and soon
afterwards sold a cedar-tree as it stood
in the scrub for £250. The purchaser,
after felling and sawing it into lengths,
had to cut a bullock track through the
jungle to haul the logs out. But he made
a hundred pounds on the deal. Another
tree from the same scrub, after being cut
up, realised £4OO. At Weerimbah (Ather-
ton), another selector was offered £365
for a standing giant that was estimated
to contain 33,000 super, feet. Red cedar
has greatly increased in value since then,
and trees that were wasted in the big
scrubs would be worth fortunes to-day.
At one time the Chinese gardens, like
the Richmond dairy farms, were fenced
with it.
* $ $ #
“Mundowie”: One of the first big
cattle stations taken up on Leichhardt’s
track, the historic Juandah, between
Miles and Taroom (Q.), is now only a
selector’s homestead, nearly all the run
having gone over to small holders.
Juandah used to be famous for its horse-
men, among them the Lawton brothers,
champion buckjump riders, well known
to the Abo. Council; it was a run
that required daring horsemen—some of
the Upper Dawson country is wild even
to-day. The first mob of cattle that was
put on it was scattered by the blacks, the
men in charge were driven away and the
huts burnt. Horses were also sent bush.
From these lost mobs originated the
herds of wild cattle and the brumbies
that for years afterwards roamed the
land from above Hornet Bank down to
the headwaters of the Dee and the Don.
* * * *
“X.”: The calumny that Labor Gov-
ernments never do anything for die
graziers is refuted by a bill pushed
through Queensland Parliament last week.
This enjoins that a compulsory bonus of
ss. must be paid on all dingo scalps, the
powers once held by the Dingo and Dis-
trict Improvement ditto being transferred
to the local authorities. It is a fine ges-
ture on the part of the Government, put
a little marred by the fact that the
councils will have to get the money for
the compulsory bonuses out of the pas-
toralists themselves, in addition to the
private funds most of them are already
finding from their own pockets. The
Government isn’t contributing a bean.
* * * *
“Iona”: Minns knows his Binghi. Wit-
ness the sketch (B. 15/11 /’33) wherein the
squatter remarks to Jacky that “yester-
day and to-day are both as close as
blazes.” to which Jacky replies that this
is so, “and to-morrow not so plurry far
off neither.” Reminds me of an occasion
when Eddie Gilbert, the abo. fast bowler
who got Bradman for a blob in Brisbane,
was practising at the nets. An enthusi-
ast said: “Takes the sweat out of a
man, this practice. It was damn close
yesterday, Eddie, wasn’t it?” Gilbert, with
perspiration creeping in runnels down his
swarthy face, grinned in agreement. “It
was close all right,” he declared, “an’
it’s not too far away to-day either!”
* * * *
Queensland employers were set back
in their latest application to the State
Industrial Court for a reduction of the
basic wage. They wanted a cut from
745. a week to 635., on the ground that
the State wage is 7s. 6d. a week higher
than the next highest in Australia —that
of N.S.W. The people opposing the
application said, among other things, that
the difference quoted was not wide
enough to bother about. The Court
agreed with them.
Gals’ Gossip from Brisbane
The T. C. Beirnes’ eldest grandchild, Doreen
Hooper, celebrated her 21st birthday by keep-
ing much of our youth and beauty awake till
the wee sma’ hours. The proud grandparents
lent their house, and twinkling colored bulbs
made the garden a fairyland. Doreen wore
white satin with uncommon touches of bronze.
Mamma was in black taffetas, and grandma’s
black georgette was cunningly frilled with lace.
The Governor’s daughter Marjorie, who
brought Rosemary Fleischmann, chose mignon-
ette-green lace with gold slippers.
Rosemary Fleischmann, who came from
England to spend the winter with her aunt.
Lady Hore-Ruthven, in Adelaide, is the guest of
Sir Leslie Wilson and Marjorie. En route to
Government House, she called on Mrs. Dudley
Persse at Beaudesert.
Dancing on the green was an innovation
suggested by the Lady Mayoress for the Dis-
trict Nursing appeal. Quite a success, too!
The music was provided by massed bands.
Lads and lassies took full advantage of the
novelty, and His Ex. Sir Leslie Wilson lent
his presence for a while.
Our much-starved Art Gallery will benefit by
the generosity of two Sydneyites. John Shorter
has given two Tinworth panels and Mrs. E.
Marie Irvine has lent three very fine etchings.
Poetess and novelist M. Forrest, who has
been on a sick bed Tor over two years, is
having her talent recognised at last. She spent
her early childhood and girlhood in the Queens-
land bush, and many of her works have been
inspired by the gumtips. Several of her novels
have been published in London, and she is
a regular contributor to The Bulletin. Mrs.
Cumbrae Stewart launched the testimonial, and
already she has received generous support.
Teddy, younger chick of the R. C. Hancocks,
of Clayfield, is showing her friends a sparkler
from Henry, only son of the C. H. Nobles, of
Wooloowin.
Cremorne Theatre was packed for the re-
cital given by the pupils of Harry Borrodale
and Peggy Chauncey. Peggy spent a lot of
time studying dancing abroad, and her solo
work was a joy. Sir Leslie Wilson gave vice-
regal approval, and the official party included
the Lady Mayoress, Mrs. A. E. Moore and her
son Euston.
School uniforms and broad smiles invaded
the Esperance Bay the day Mrs. Hartland, head-
mistress of St. Aidan’s College, returned after
six months abroad. She went away to investi-
gate possible avenues of employment for girls,
and found that hundreds were putting aside
office work for nursing and the like. Second-
ary-school teachers here say the same.
Director of Education McKenna is so im-
pressed with the leatherwork done by pupils
of the Haden State school that he intends
to arrange an exhibition.
Back by the Orsova came Chief Scout Com-
missioner Snow and Mrs. Snow. Commandant
of 86 Scouts who attended the jamboree in
Hungary, he speaks with pride of how the
Aussies impressed everyone with their fine
physique and general behavior. A visit to Lord
and Lady Baden-Powell’s home was included
in the trip, Mrs. Snow coming away with a
personal message to the Girl Guides. Also,
she tells us, the Chief Scout and his lady will
bring their daughters Betty and Heather on
their visit next year.

When did a Labor party first come into

The first Labor member,' Allen McDonald,
was returned for Launceston in 1893. In 1903,
three Labor members were returned ; in 1906
seven in a House of 35. The Parliament of
1906-09 reduced the number of members to 30,
and in the 1909 elections Labor secured 12
seats. The Lewis Ministry being defeated on
a vote of censure, John Earle formed the first
Labor Ministry, but could not attract sufficient
outside support to give him a majority, and
Lewis came back to office.

In northern N.S.W. the majority of councils
are employing persons who are in need of food
relief. To be eligible for this employment a
person must be enrolled on a N.S.W. electoral
roll for 12 months, and be a resident of a par-
ticular locality for the preceding three months,
In districts where such employment is available
food relief is not issued to able-bodied men or
their dependants.

Why are the cores of audio frequency trans-
formers in radio receivers laminated instead of
being made of a solid piece of metal ?— 9152.
, To reduce the formation of eddy currents in
the core. These are small whirlpools ot in-
duced energy which produce losses due to the
heat generated. Their paths are restricted to
very narrow limits by making the core of thin
insulated laminations.
/.y there any difference between “resistance,”
“reactance” and “impedance” as applied to an
electric circuit ? 9178.
Resistance is the opposition to the flow ol
electric current caused by the conductor, ihe
opposition to the flow of alternating currents
caused by inductance and capacity is called le-
actance. The combined opposition ot resist-
ance and reactance to alternating currents is
called impedance.
(1) J intend, installing a moving-coil loud-
speaker in a different room from the receiver.
Should the output transformer be located at
t he receiver end or at the loudspeaker end?
(2) Reasons for this ?—\ 9187.
(i) a nd (2) When long connecting leads are
use d between the speaker and the set it is often
preferable to connect the output transformer
t o the receiver end for the following reasons:
the capacity of the extension leads will do less
harm; the leads will be isolated froin the H.T.
voltage, and interference due to hum from local
circuits will be greatly reduced. However, the
ohmic resistance of the leads must be low, as
compared to that of the moving coil of the
loudspeaker.

(1) Comparative literary merits of the works
of Rider Haggard, Jeffery Farnol, Hugh Wal-
pole, John Buchan and J. B. Priestley? (2)
What are their outstanding characteristics ?
8987 , .
(1) In order of merit: Walpole, Priestley,
Haggard, Buchan, Farnol; but it is, of course,
matter of opinion. (2) Walpole, firm, artis-
tic craftsmanship, wide range. Priestley, sub-
stantial, grand-manner novelist of contemporary
English life. Haggard, lurid imagination,
backed by vivid style and anthropological know-
ledge. Buchan, smooth, popular adventure
stories told with charm. Farnol, one book
(“The Broad Highway”) of semi-literary value;
remainder, potboilers.
(1) Are the lion and the unicorn, or is either,
found in the heraldry of Japan or of the
Samurai ? (2) Is the' Mikado regarded as the
son of the rising sun ? —9125.
(1) A unicorn figures in the crest of the
Mikado. Can find no record of the lion.
(2) The Shinto belief is that the gods created
Japan and the sun goddess sent her grandson
to rule it. The grandson of this grandson was
the Emperor Jimmu, who came to the throne
in 660 b.c., and from whom the present
dynasty claims direct descent.
What is the appearance of the green tree-
snake (Dendrophis punctulatus ) ? To what
length does it attain and what does it eat ?
9097.
In repose it is green above, but when angry
flattens its neck and exhibits a peacock-blue
coloring between the body scales. The forepart
of the body below is usually a rich yellow.
This snake is an expert climber, using the
angular keels on its ventral scales in a remark-
able way. It grows to about seven feet, and
feeds on frogs and lizards.
How many species of scrub-robins are there
in Australia, and in what parts do they occur ?
What is their coloring and cry ? What kind of
nest do they build, and how many eggs do they
lay ?— 8733.
Of scrub-robins ( Drymodes ) there are three
species, two occurring in Australia and the
third in New Guinea and the Aru Islands.
They are shy, rather smaller than ground-birds
fCinclosoma), to which they are allied, chest-
nut-brown above and dirty-white below, usually
frequenting stony ground in open scrub coun-
try, and spending most of their time moving
by fits and starts along the ground. They
utter a sharp whistling note. One species,
D. brunneopygius, is found in the inland dis-
tricts of the southern States; the other, D
superciliaris, in the Northern Territory and
northern Queensland. Scrub-robins build open,
cup-shaped nests of sticks, bark and leaves on
the ground, at the foot of a tree or bush, and
lay two or three white or greyish eggs, blotched
with brown.
(1) What are the habits of the rainbow-fish, or
Maori, to be found in N.S.W. waters ? (2)
What food does it eat ? (3) Method of cap-
ture, and is it a sporting fish ? (4) Edible
qualities ? —B7OB.
(1) This fish abounds among the headlands
and reefs. The time and locality of its spawn-
ing are not definitely known. (2) Principally
crabs, prawns and molluscs. (3) Hook and line
are practically the only means employed. The
Maori is of no value as a sporting fish, never
attaining sufficient size or strength to put up a
fight. (4) Like other parrot-fishes, the Maori
is held in varied esteem, some accounting it of
excellent flavor, and others disliking it. Its
gaudy colors prejudice many against it.
(1) Was Mergenthaler the inventor of the
type-setting machine ? (2) Date of invention of
the linotype ? —9027.
(1) No. The first practicable type-setting
machine is ascribed to one Hattersley, an Eng-
lishman. The London “Times” for many years
before linotypes were invented used type-setting
machines (they assembled single types in the
same way as a linotype assembles matrices)
which were an improvement on Hattersley’s
machine, patented in 1872 by Kastenbein. The
ninth edition of the “Encyclopaedia Britannica”
(1888) was partly set up on Fraser machines,
also on the Hattersley principle. All these
machines, and also one invented by Mackie,
which used a perforated roll of paper, were on
the market before the linotype swept them into
oblivion. (2) First patent (U.S.A.) is dated
1885.
(1) How many Fenian prisoners were sent
to Westralia ? (2) Any escape ? (3) If so, did
American friends help them ? —8779.
(1) About 60. (2) and (3) John Boyle
O’Reilly escaped aboard an American whaler,
the captain of which was in league with the
American Fenians, and six other Fenians got
away later with similar assistance.
(1) To what species does the “old man” kan-
garoo belong ? (2) What part of Australia
does he inhabit ? (3) Coloring and size ? (4)
In what class of country is he usually to be
found? (5) Does he move about in organised
herds ? —9141.
(1) Macropus giganteus. (2) All parts of the
mainland except the centre and extreme north.
(3) A full-grown male specimen measures about
Bft. from nose to tip of tail; the tail is about
3ft. long. The fur is short, close and rather
woolly, of a grey-brown color above and almost
white underneath. (4) Usually open eucalypt
forest country. During the extreme heat of
summer it often takes shelter in thicker belts
of timber and scrub. (5) In small parties,
which appear to be casual associations without
leadership or coherency.
Who was the Vicar of Bray? —9113.
He was Simon Alewyn, appointed Vicar of
Bray, in Berkshire, during the reign of Henry
VIII. He maintained his position during the
reigns of Edward VI., Mary and Elizabeth by
accommodating his religious principles to those
in power. It was his aim to live and die
Vicar of Bray, an ambition which he achieved.
The vicar is made to live through the reigns
of Charles TI., James 11., William 111., Anne
and George I. in the ballad beginning “In
good King Charles’s golden days.”
fl) Date of arrival in Sydney of Charles
Godfrey, a singer on the Harry Rickards cir-
cuit? (2) Date of his death? —8952.
(1) Made his first Sydney appearance on
May 9, 1896, at the Tivoli. (2) Exact date un-
known. It occurred some time before 1906.
Recipe for (1) a mouthwash, and (2) a tooth-
paste of a saponifying nature ? —8735.
(1) Put 3 pints rather hot water into a large
screw-top jar and shake in 2oz. finely-powdered
borax from the chemist. Allow to cool, but
before it is quite cold add 1| teaspoons tinc-
ture of myrrh and 1| teaspoons spirits of
camphor. Stir well, and keep covered. May
be used pure or slightly diluted with water.
(2) Finely scraped or powdered white Castile
soap, 4 drachms; heavy carbonate of magnesia,
loz.; precipitated chalk, 30z.; oil of pepper-
mint, 10 drops; glycerine, loz.; rosewater,
enough to make a stiff paste. Mix the soap,
magnesia and oil in a mortar, then add the
glycerine, and finally the rosewater. But you
can buy both preparations ready-made cheaper
than you can make them.

into the temple of Kali Durga, near Cal-
cutta, and got away with all the lady’s
ornaments, valued at £IO,OOO. Thirty
years or so ago you might have combed
all India to find a man game to tackle
this formidable dame, the spouse of
Shiva, for whom I have had a lingering
sympathy ever since I first met his better
half in idol form. Black as soot, six-
armed, and holding severed heads, with
noose, swords and other appurtenances
to justify her claim to be the goddess of
destruction, her crowning beauty was an
immense scarlet tongue reaching down
to her equator. When I last saw her at
Dakshineswar the string of skulls about
her neck was pure gold, each skull about
the size of a cricket ball. The floor of
Kali’s abode is always knee-deep in the
sacred cowdung, which is only removed
when visitors to the temple take it away
on their feet and clothes.
“Youngest Inhabitant”: The earliest
memorial to Captain Cook (B. 8/11 /’33)
was erected by Lord Byron and the
officers of the Blonde in 1825 ; it stands
on the place of the great seaman’s death.
Two years later one was erected at Great
Ay ton, Yorkshire, where Cook was partly
educated. Not until 1914 could London
boast a Cook statue, although several
years earlier a commemorative tablet
had been affixed to 88 Mile End-road,
where he once lived. The most famous
memorial of all is in the church of St.
Andrew the Great in Cambridge—a
monument commemorating Cook, his
widow and every member of the family.
When Mrs. Cook died she left £1000 for
the upkeep of this monument, stipulating
that the residue should go to five poor
aged women. Another comparatively
unknown memorial is in the Stockton
parish church; This was dedicated in
1927, and has an engraving of the Reso-
lution on one side and Cook’s crest and
the globe on the other.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
The strong, silent business men of the
city handed their crown of sorrows over
to the typist last Friday, and rushed
the stands at Rushcutter Bay. Mother
and the girls and the family thermos also
arrived. It was one of those hot days
with a grey-smeared sky, from behind
which the sun sneaks out and crimsons
the nose and the chest of the unwary
who have wandered forth small-hatted
and uncreamed. “Mixed grills” might
have been the sign run up half-way
through the afternoon above the un-
covered stands. But the Sydney girls in
their prints and simple tennis frocks, their
arms and throats bare and brown, looked
like Arcadian shepherdesses out on the
spree. Banners and flags fluttered fresh
and free above the stands ; the courts
were green ; so were the chairs in the
members’ stand; gay little flapjack
cushions were sold by enthusiasts of the
Kindergarten Union and netted a bob
apiece for the cause ; one wag of a news-
boy pushed an early edition forward with
the words “To sit on.” Everybody was
as merry as a locust in the sun —especi-
ally when Australia took the hat trick
in the singles; but the long and the
short of it in the Hopman-Lee match
was that the bare knees of Harry wrested
the victory, though the legs of his Eng-
lish opponent were more admirable.
The Jack Crawfords’ arrival caused a
stir ; English player F. J. Perry and movie
star Joy Howarth were with them. Mrs.
Crawford was smartly tailored in choco-
late tones ; Joy flew a tiny white toque
above her grey suit. Government House
was represented by Commander Gifford,
who brought mother, Mrs. Rayner, and
sister Joan;' Mollie Street’s navy silk
wore white polka dots; Philippa
Stephen’s pink Shantungs and shady hat
caused a flicker of interest; so did the
passing of Joan Hartigan and Harry
Hopman’s mother. Mrs. Reg Bettington,
of tennis and golf fame, very vivid in
white and red, was another who stayed
till stumps were drawn.
The many Australian friends of Mrs.
J. S. Lyster will hear with regret of her
death in Guernsey, where she had been
living since she left this country with
her husband, the late Colonel J. S. Lyster,
some 10 years ago. Though her hus-
band’s duties took him from State to
State at different times —he was com-
mandant in Queensland, N.S.W. and
South Australia after Federation —most
of Mrs. Lyster’s Australian life was spent
in Queensland, whither the pair came
many years ago from India. A woman
of infinite charm and wit, she made for
herself a wide and devoted circle of
acquaintances.
Minister Jack Dunningham was not in
his office on Thursday afternoon ; he was
at the wedding of William Edward Kelso
and Edna Weeden at St. Jude’s, Rand-
wick, and the reception at Orville. The
charming bride wore a tailored frock
of ash-blue flat crepe, with a match-
ing jacquette and picture hat of the same
material; the ’maid, Enid Parker, wore
blistered crepe in a soft beige shade, with
a toque of the same material. Canon
Cakebread performed the ceremony, and
the ’groom was attended by his brother
Frank. Mr. Nightingale, an uncle of
the bride, gave her away ; her aunt, Mrs.
Parker, assisted by the ’groom’s mother,
received. Kelsos have been identified
with Randwick almost since there was
a Randwick, and four generations were
at St. Jude’s —the aged Mrs. William
Kelso, her son William, his son Jack and
Jack’s two children.
There was bridge and there was danc-
ing, and you could have whichever you
preferred, at the Royal Empire Society’s
party last week. The dais in the Went-
worth ballroom was decked with flags
and the official table with languishing red
roses, for this was the end-of-the-year
rally and something of an occasion. For
three little women it was a sort of tri-
umphal procession. They were the three
youngsters who had won the prizes in
the society’s annual essay competition.
They had a table to themselves and were
produced at the psychological moment to
receive commendation and cheques from
Chief Justice Harvey. President Hugh
Denison, too, turned his haunting smile
on them, while the tall and decorated W.
G. Layton stood by smiling grave
approval. The Denison lady’s vellum
lace frock was long ; so were her diamond
earrings, and it didn’t need figures to
prove that it is a far, far better thing to
own a newspaper than to write for one.
The C.J.’s lady was prevented from
coming, so daughter Mrs. Jim Litchfield,
from Cooma, partnered dad, and wore a
white chiffon frock befrilled as to cape
and skirt. The Mayoral Hagons gave
civic tone; her cobalt-blue laces were
handsome in quality and design. Mrs.
O. F. Phillips, who came with her Briga-
dier-General, had black ostrich feather
fronds outlining the shoulders of her
black velvet frock ; Olive King brought
her father and' yellow frocking; Mrs.
Roystone Davey sparkled in cherry-red
chiffons ; Mrs. C. V. Potts was there with
daughter Viva, and Mrs. H. W. Potts
was with daughter Una; Mrs. W. H.
Mackay aired a black-and-white cape on
her white laces. The naval Popes, the
Colonel Spains, the banking Riddles and
dozens of others equally well-turned-out
and Empire-minded made a night of it.
Public Librarian Ifould and artist
Norman Carter were speakers at
the opening of the Lloyd Rees show in
the Macquarie Galleries, but the air was
murmurous with admiration long before
the orations. Lloyd’s pencil is forceful
and subtle, and can suggest the most deli-
cate nuances of shade, the vivid rush of
sunlight. Already his fame has gone
abroad, and when the present exhibition
is over one of the drawings will find a
home in a Californian gallery.
The melting eyes in this photograph
belong to Lilian Goldsmith, and behind
them works a very cool legal brain.
Lilian is one of the few women solicitors
in the State, and probably the youngest
—she’s still in the early twenties. She
is on the staff of a Pitt-street law firm,

At the A.B.C. Brahms-Wagner con-
cert there was enough wind blown
through the trumpets, the bassoons, the
oboes and the trombones to send one of
the old tea clippers scudding round the
Horn and back again. But the storm
didn’t intimidate Bernard Heinze, of Mel-
bourne ; though occasionally tossed like
a cork upon his little poop when the
brasses really let themselves go in the
“Tannhauser” overture, triumphantly he
rode the tempest. He deserved a laurel-
wreath for this, but it would certainly
have been blown away in the subsequent
tornado of “The Valkyrie.” The audience
that listened was very swagger half-way
through the alphabet; on the outer posts
of Empire (say about row “Q”) the
dressing fell off.
In splendid isolation the Charlie Lloyd
Joneses awaited in the vestibule the arrival
of the vice-regals. The amazing fairy-
tale chandelier flashed down its broad
white ribbons of light, caught in them
the burgundy tone of Mrs. Charlie’s frock,
turned it amethystine, and made her
string of pearls look as expensive as they
probably are. Both Sir Philip and Lady
Game paid tribute, and Aide Gifford
and J. C. Williamson’s Charlie Westma-
cott were others in an audience that in-
cluded every musicianly somebody in
Sydney from Dr. Orchard down.
There’s no dentifrice smile about this
Dorothy Welding picture of Elsie Wearn,
yet she’s the only woman doctor of den-
tistry in the State. Elsie has just re-
turned to Sydney after taking a post-
graduate course at Toronto Uni. and
putting in a lot of research work in the
clinics of the U.S.A. and England. She
is of the opinion that it is to the foods
the American eats —every meal is pre-
pared with an eye to vitamin values —that
the splendid tooth growth of Uncle Sam’s
children can be attributed. The Eng-
lishman’s home may be his castle, but
so often, alas! his teeth need a crown.
Dr. Elsie resumes her duties this week
at the Rachel Forster, that gallant little
hospital run by women for women and
kiddies; and at the Langton Clinic.
Chippendale went social one afternoon
last week, and car after car softly snored
its way out to the University Settlement.
The Settlement is one of the social wel-
fare movements of the Uni., and the
event which drew the assemblage with
polished nails and polished speech was
the unveiling of a portrait of Mungo
MacCallum’s lady, one of its founders.
Miss Macarthur Onslow, who officiated
in the absence of Lady Game, first of
all read a letter from the latter eulogis-
ing the great humanity of the portrait’s
subject. The educational Miss Fidler
and Miss Mallarky added praises of the
great little professor’s wife. The one
painted a graphic picture of her cutting
the Christmas cakes which she had baked
at the mothers’ club ; the other told of
her foresight in deciding on buying the
Settlement House for £l6OO, though at
the time there was only £lOO in the
treasury. Chancellor of the University
William Cullen and daughter Ailsa added
their congratulations.
The stall piled with bottles of pre-
serves, the flower stall and the stall
whereon the canary in its gilded cage
looked moodily on while a white cocka-
too made searching inventory of its live
stock were as deserted as villages whose
able-bodied are off to the wars. But
thick and clamorous the soldiers of for-
tune clustered around the housie-housie
stalls, the straining dogs who raced madLy
inspired by the band in its green gun-
yah, the monkeys that in super-sports
models spurned a high voltage speed-
way. The city was haying a mad gamble
with its thrippennies in the interests of
the Red Cross, and what mother will do
next week for small silver for the
Christmas puddings doesn’t bear think-
ing of. Another spirited way of spend-
ing your cash was to put it on the
bombers. This was a fleet of aeroplanes
that buzzed overhead, and dropped darts
with a bang. The prize in most cases
was a box of chocolates; but as indi-
cated by the name housie-housie was
more serious-minded, and the glint of
aluminium and tin household gadgets
flashed on the passing gaze.
The Women’s Club buzzed with ex-
citement on Friday, when the Women
Graduates of Sydney Uni. turned their
end-of-the-year meeting into a Christmas
party. Tall lilies and plump roses shed
virginal and roguish smiles from a dais
on which president Marie Bentivoglio, «n
a red backless crepe frock, served hand-
some welcomes to Susie Williams, prin-
cipal of the Women’s College, and
Gladys Marks. Under Faunce Allman’s
expressive eyebrows the Uni. Musical
Society sang student songs, gathered the
world around. Dr. Mary Booth and Dr.
Grace Boelke were among the guests;
Aileen Fitz Patrick rushed about with
coffee and cakes ; Althea Wallace was a
nice-looking girl in white, Joan Mack-
aness was another in blue. There was no
Christmas tree; perhaps the ’ologies jibbed
at that, though a prettier decoration for
one couldn’t be found than Esme Burfitt
with her airy flowered chiffons and her
crystal beads. Among the guests were
Mrs. Von Hein, a recent arrival from
Europe; Miss Short, just back from
Oxford, and Miss Hammond, of Bedford
College, London. Farewells were said to
novelist Flora Eldershaw and Dr. Claire
Weekes, both Europe-bound.
May Matthews, known for her political
activities, was one of those who went to
Norfolk Island and Noumea by the
Strathnaver. For two months this clever
speaker was prostrated by ’flu.
When we first meet them the sun-
brown of the English tennis players
awakes mild wonderment. Then we re-
member that the first layers or two were
probably acquired sunbaking on their
journey through the tropics. Anyway,
their teeth flashed very white in the tan
of their faces last week when the Tennis
Association introduced them to Sydney
over the teacups. There was only stand-
ing room in the clubhouse at Rushcutter
Bay, and the visiting players, who had
been loosening up on the courts, must
have felt on entering that all the world’s
a smile. The Dussaps, Consular repre-
sentatives of the land that has given the
world the Lenglen and Borotra, naturally
came along to pay their respects to the
sport; also present were America’s
Consul-General and Mrs. Caldwell,
whose own countrymen have some repu-
tation. The Jack Crawfords were stars
of the afternoon, and Viv. McGrath,
Harry Hopman, Quist and Dunlop were
bright constellations revolving around
the English comets. The presidential
Frank Peaches were the receivers, she
very vivid in a red ensemble.
The cricket Xls. of the future will
have to include some girls if they’re to
bring home the Ashes. Crossing King-
street the other afternoon, this Letter saw
one of the neatest bits of fielding. A
slim girl with a wide white organdie hat,
its crown of the pancake variety, was
turning into Castlereagh-street. A sud-
den spurt of wind sent the hat soaring
to the right. The wearer made a Pavlova
hop, flung out her arm, caught the errant
lid and swept it back on to her head in
one graceful curve.

It being near the end of the year, there
is an epidemic of garden parties. M.L.C.
Old Girls had one, with Mrs. Basil
Kilvington as welcomer. The same Mrs.
Kilvington founded the association 30
years ago. On Saturday she carried pink
blooms with the hand which was not
occupied with repeated shakes. Along-
side were the Rev. and Mrs. Grove. Out
of deference to the weather, hon. sec.
Ethel Barker hung a black swagger coat
over her patterned greeny frock. Ena
Bee and Mary Fox provided music.
Special guests were Polly Turnbull, Mrs.
Ewart Moreton, Kathleen Stobie, Mrs.
F. W. Kitchin, Adelaide’s M.L.C. repre-
sentative Mrs. R. S. Oswald, and Miss
Hester.
Girl Guides ran a fete at Roystead,
the home of Mr. A. Macneil. Brownies
spent their saved-up pennies on pony
rides, Rangers bartered their goods from
a bushy tree in the garden, and there
were stalls stocked up with all sorts of
Christmassy wares. Dr. Jessie Simpson
had the unenviable task of judging the
chubby entrants in the baby show. The
opener was Mrs. W. S. Kent Hughes,
who was escorted by Mrs. J. Demaine.
Mrs. John Good, with her daughters,
Mrs. Leviny and Ruth Good, gave an
afternoon party at No. 9. Here the
sheeny furniture reflected a variety of
roses, blushes of peonies and spears of
gladioli. The hottest day we’ve had so
far tempted forth summery apparel. The
hostess’s navy crepe displayed open-work
embroideries, and starched net trimmed
her wide-brimmed hat. Mrs. Leviny’s
sprigged muslin wore a black girdle, and
sister Ruth’s pastel tones merged upon
blistered crepe beneath a wide expanse
of hat-brim. Among those who wielded
teacups and the implements of bridge
were Mrs. Geoffrey Syme, in black
strewn with spring flowers ; Mrs. Edward
Hallenstein, in black and white spots;
Judy Finch, Ina Corbett and Iris Con-
nolly.
On the day this page is wet with
printer’s ink Cynthia Brookes becomes
Melbourne’s Lud Mayoress. She is 21 and
the eldest joy of Mr. and Mrs. Norman
Brookes. She and her two sisters are
much-travelled, their education at
Toorak College being broken into by
trips to Europe and America and surfing
holidays to Honolulu. Bridegroom
Gengoult Smith is in his early forties, a
bachelor who holds a medical degree,
but is too keen on civic and social duties
to practise. He is one of Melbourne’s
best-groomed men. It’s to be an all-
white wedding. The bridal satins will be
swept by a train of rose point lace.
Several hundred yards of tulle will foam
round twelve bridesmaids and one small
trainbearer. Col. Stevenson as best man
will march at the head of the battalion
of groomsmen, and there’s to be a guard-
of-honor culled from a half-dozen of
Navy, Army and Air Force. One thou-
sand guests are each hanging on tight
to their two cards of entree, for they
won’t get into St. Paul’s or be able to
nibble a celebration sandwich in the civic
barn without such an open sesame.
Jewellers’ shops are reaping a succulent
harvest. The presents will be protected
by a squad of C.I.D. sleuths while on
view at the Town Hall. An Esler camera
made the portrait of the bride.
Thronged with invited guests, Mel-
bourne’s newest picture palace, the May-
fair, was opened on Friday night. Shop-
pers pressed their noses to the glass
entrance door, over which a large robin-
redbreasted official presided. Within the
foyer were a map and shield in flowers,
an animal made of carnations, which
looked like a kangaroo with a touch of
native-bear among his ancestors, and a
wave of carbolic. Premier Argyle and
H. L. Setchell did the unlocking. Among
the invited were Stephen Morell and his
lady, the F. W. Thrings, the D. J. and
the Maurice Sloman couples, and Prof.
Osborne. The new talkie-theatre is to be
a British house, but its first film had a
strong Yankee flavor. After the interval
came Jack Hulbert and Cicely Court-
neidge in “Falling for You.”
The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra
puts on its grand finale for 1933 in the
Town Hall. Fritz Hart conducted and
Gertrude Healy was soloist in the Mozart
D Major Concerto for Violin and
Orchestra. Her garb went along the lines
of black velvet skirt and wine-swathed
blouse, and she received such a floral
ovation that friends with cars were called
in to help transport the tributes. In the
audience was every type of garment,
from tiaras to tweedy suits, and from
tails and white ties to the clothes in
which a man loves to do the garden.
Many of the really musical had no make-
up and hair like birds’ nests.
This is one of the tallest ’maids among
the all-white dozen who will figure at
the Smith-Brookes wedding. She is
Nancy, only daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
W. H. Griffiths, of Toorak, and a
second-cousin of the bride. Tennis is
her specialty. Miss Griffiths was born
in Melbourne and is one of the younger
old girls of St. Catherine’s. Snapshot by
Broothorn.
With the meanest kind of thief getting
off with £B-odd, and with persistent
showers, the fete at the Royal Institute
for the Blind suffered an unfair setback.
Helpers scuttled in and out like rabbits,
arranging their wares on the already-
decked stalls and rescuing them when the
drops got big and heavy. But patrons
spent ungrudgingly, for never is the
blessing of good health rammed home
more securely than in such an environ-
ment. The Irvine lady opened the three-
days’ fete. A baby show was included,
and in the evening blind children dis-
played their love of song and dance in
the Ormond Hall. This week the Institute
had a welcome Christmas gift. The
Government has acceded free wireless
licenses to blind persons. For every blind
person has a radio ; among the poorest
folk they are gifts of the Institute, which
has also paid for licenses.
The Albert-street Con. put the lid on
its year’s work with a concert in the
Assembly Hall. White-clad students
trooped one by one on to the dais to
expound what adornments Melba’s
academy had pinned to their voices and
pianoforte talents. Long frocks are a
boon to trembling knees ; also they im-
bue confidence somewhat on the ostrich
principle. When each of the 16 soloists
had had her moment of triumph and
a lone male his (he took part in a piano
concerto) there was a presentation to
Mary Campbell. It was a miniature, a
mark of affection from her present
pupils ; those of the past are scattered
in all sorts of odd corners of the world.
The modest recipient murmured her
thanks in black with transparencies for
sleeve and yoke.
Perth’s pleasant moments:
Mt. Yokine Golf Club smothered its lounges
with flowers and put on a cheery dance at its
made-for-the-purpose clubhouse. Marjorie
Luyer strung a gay trail of green leaves down
the back of her gingernut laces; Molly Lloyd’s
black cobwebs caught flowery flies of black
organdie; Jo Davies’s gardenia satins were
sheath-like ; yards and yards of pink tulle served
to gird Allison Abbott; Mrs. Alex. Kelly’s coffee
angel-skin lace was enviable, and jade-and-white
organdie billowed on Mrs. Hall.
Cecile Scott caught a floating cloud of tulle,
fixed it to her head with orange-blossom and
met Bob Jacka at St. Andrew’s Church. Her
sheaf of Christmas lilies melted into soft swath-
ings of magnolia satin which boasted a little
short coat. Mrs. Hugh Banger, Ena Cockram
and Jessie Hardie comprised the rearguard,
their trained apricot lace draperies being topped
by cartwheel stiffened lace veils held in place
with silver tissue hub caps.
For the garden party at St. George’s College
the lawns donned their greenest robes, flowers
flaunted their brightest petals and the sun shone
on a galaxy of color in feminine raiment.
Warden Law and Sub-Warden Storrs escorted
the v.-r. party to one of the tables' set on the
verandahs surrounding the quadrangle, where
milady sipped tea in navy georgettes flecked
with flowerets. Miniature golf and tennis had
their followers, and the R.S.L. band gave
orchestral selections for those who failed to
secure a pew for the organ recital in the chapel.
Flier A. E. Hadfield took off at St. Mary’s
Cathedral for a matrimonial cruise with Gladys
McDaniell, who started the journey in a trim
oyster craquelle suit, strapped with black cire
satin and worn with an eye-concealing black
Yedda straw head covering. ’Maid Joan
McDaniell’s rigout was a symphony in dawn
pink. Singapore is scheduled for the first land-
ing.
A hundred years ago the families of Lay-
man, Bussell and Abbey brought candlesticks
to W.A. Now they have removed them from
their homes, fixed them to a polished plinth of
iarrah taken from the first lighthouse built at
Busselton and handed them over to the Y.A.L.
The League’s founder, J. J. Simons, and
president Boas went to the old town for the
ceremony, where descendants of the families
lit the candles, which remained burning during
proceedings.
A round of farewells has been the lot of
Y.W.C.A. secretary Miss Tulloch, whose call
tp matrimony takes her to Adelaide. The asso-
ciation’s board of directors decked headquarters
with carnations and Madonna lilies for their
party and pressed a sheaf of gladioli against
the folds of her primrose floral chiffons. Ex-
president Mrs. Ernest Lee Steere, swathed in
burnt-biscuit georgette, gave a rose-fragrant
luncheon at the Karrakatta Club.
The Saw sisters, Elsie, Pat, Isla and Gwen,
gathered a host of young things to dance at
their home and bid bon voyage to yet another
sister, Valma, who is bent on holidaying in
Singapore. Mrs. Saw’s black lace and ninon
fluttered around in the early stages, and Val’s
orange creation stayed the distance.
Mrs. E. B. Sinclair roofed red-and-white
figured silk marocain with oatmeal straw to
launch the Women’s Service Guild bazaar at
National House. Acting-president Mrs. A. E.
Joyner, set about with navy and white, was on
the platform with Mrs. Vallance and Mrs.
Browning-Turner. Ethel Crisp, Georgie Small-
page and Mesdames Nagel and Kershaw gave
items.
Mrs. W. Balston’s floral georgettes were the
only deviation from the officials’ choice of black
furbishings at the Victoria League’s social. The
Karrakatta Club’s white walls made a good
background for secretary Miss Habgood’s
chenille georgettes, Mrs. Davies’s Chantilly and
assistant-secretary Jean Parker’s combination of
lace and chiffon.
Festivities of Adelaide:
Mayor and Mayoress Glover gave their last
reception in an official capacity. Many hus-
bands accompanied their wives to the party,
and the reception-room was crowded. The
overflow had to be accommodated in the
Mayor’s parlor, and it was a cheery cocktail
shivoo. Mrs. Glover wore a smart black lace
toilette and wide-brimmed hat.
The most brilliant private-house party of
the season was the bal masque given by 17
debutantes, and held at Darroch, the beautiful
old home of the J. A. C. Marshalls at Payne-
ham. The broad centre staircase with wide
balcony round the huge hall made an impres-
sive setting. Multicolored balloons and bowls
of mixed flowers provided the decoration, and
the frocking was of the smartest. Peggy, the
Marshalls’ youngest daughter, and one of the
hostesses, went as “The Lacquered Lady,”
gowned in gold tissue, and her pretty, dark
shingle lacquered. Several of the girls wore
the frocks in which they had appeared in the
Queen competition of the Kuitpo Gala. One
of the best impersonations was Frankie Rymill’s
“Alice in Wonderland,” in a short, flowered
voile frock, socks, sandals, and her long fair
hair past her waist.
The annual fete at the Children’s Hospital
was a great success, the weather being perfect.
The wide balcony overlooking the grounds was
crowded with juvenile invalids, watching the
gay scene. Lady Hore-Ruthven launched the
bazaar, and was welcomed by Drs. H. Gilbert
and D. G. McKay, and presented with a
bouquet by a tiny patient. An inspection of
the wards followed, when Lady Hore-Ruthven
was entertained at tea by president Glover and
his wife.
There was a good roll-up at Cheltenham for
the A.R.C. summer meeting. The strong
westerly wind caused several fair ones to sprint
after their wide-brimmed hats. The chairman
(Dr. A. V. Benson) and his wife entertained
at afternoon tea, Mrs. Benson wearing a black
crepe ensemble, a small black straw hat and a

2NK Calling'.
BY JOHN ANDREWS.
/£ X H! Moon of my Dee-light that
/\ know’st no wane”
It is the voice of George
Quixote Perry. “But why does he singV'
you ask. I, too, have asked the ques-
tion ; but I will allow that he has an
excuse.
I met George through his Aunt Phoebe
coming into the offices of 2NK, dressed
in the fashion of 1900, when half a yard
of mesh made a hairnet instead of a com-
plete suit of underwear. She had George
at heel, and had called to tell us that
during a Melbourne programme which
we had relayed she had distinctly heard
the Yarra frogs in full chorus.
As Uncle Ferdie, of 2NK, it fell to my
lot to show her round, and, incidentally,,
to clear up the matter of the frogs. We
had quite an interesting talk, with George
glowering in the background. When
about to depart she promised to bring
him again. “So instructive; it will im-
prove his mind,” she said.
I met George again at a studio party ;
and on that occasion he poured out his
troubles. He told me he had expectations
from Aunt Phoebe. He was used to being
regarded by her as a half-witted child,
but when she proposed to interfere with
his Art he had indignantly left her roof.
His Art, it seemed, was little jokes and
drawings which he sold to unsuspecting
editors. The Proceeds he invested with
bookmakers
Further disaster had overtaken him.
The WQrk of the chap he copied had
f a u en to such an extent that George’s
work was affected in turn ; so much so
that he found himself unable to interest
the most unsuspecting editors. Nor was
he able to find another paragon whose
style so suited his own. In despair
George forsook such meretricious efforts
and turned his attention to Art.
All of this met with Aunt Phoebe’s
disapproval. He stood to come into a
good round sum when she decided that
he had attained years of discretion, but
discretion and senility were synonymous
in the opinion of George. However, his
need at the moment was a studio. Fool-
ishly, I suggested that he take the vacant
apartment next to mine,
On the following day I introduced
him to Alice, the. charlady and caretaker.
George and I got to know each other
thoroughly. It was no time at all before
j was hiding my socks and ties under
the mattress and keeping a watchful eye
on m y wardrobe, although not before
George had “borrowed” my pearl-grey
f e h with the snap brim (18s. lid. at
Schwingheimer’s—mention 2NK). Of
course, he could not return it covered
with paint. It is still covered with
paint.
During these visits George would go
into his troubles, wondering how he
could reconcile Aunt Phoebe with his A rt.
George had reached the point where he
had to have money. It was the land-
lord’s opinion, at any rate.
“What’s to stop you from sending your
aunt a little present?” I brightly sug-
gested.
“The Poisons Act,” George replied
morbidly.
“You don’t follow me. I mean an art
outfit. You say she has a birthday
shortly. Send her a Peerless Art Out-
fit ; 12s. 6d. at MacTaggerts’; mention
2NK. ‘From an anonymous well-
wisher.’ ”
“And lose all the credit for the kind
thought?”
“You misunderstand me,” I went on.
“As soon as she gets it she’ll have, the
things out of the box, and, being a
woman, she’s bound to try them. Then,
first thing you know, she’ll be art-con-
scious ! ”
“You don’t know my aunt. The last
thing she was conscious of was the Cri-
mean War. Anyhow, what do I use for
money?”
Intrigued with my idea and naturally
openhanded, I took the plunge. “I’ll
see you through,” I said.
He felt better at this, and presently,
abandoning all pretence of gratitude, he
left with an odd pair of cuff-links. The
next day I had a Peerless Art Outfit dis-
patched to Aunt Phoebe.
Events took a personal turn. I will
ask you to judge charitably. If your
great-uncle did hold up the Glen Innes
mail, whose business is that? Ours. And
if I did love a beautiful girl, whose con-
cern is it? Mine.
Marion Blake it was. She had hair
the color and texture of a thundercloud
with the light behind it, and eyes that
were amber in the sunlight. Apart from
all this, she had an impetuous nature and
was given to fits of temper.
It was inevitable that Marion and
George should meet. One evening while
I was entertaining her in my rooms with
excerpts from my Children’s Hour,
George dropped in to say he had actu-
ally sold a painting.
“Would you like to meet an artist?”
I said to Marion.
“Is he famous?” she asked naively.
“Famous, why he’s infamous,” I re-
plied lightly.
Her interest was immediately aroused.
George had his hair freshly crimped
or marcelled, or whatever these young
bloods do to it, and owing to his recent
period of. enforced abstinence looked
trim and . smart in a superficial way.
Marion always looked her best.
For the rest of thle evening they looked
at each other. When George told her how
an American had made an offer for his
“Delphiniums in a Garden” because it
reminded him of the railroad depot at
Podunk, N.Y., her admiration knew no
bounds. Before the evening had come
to an end George had declared his inten-
tion of painting her, and she had de-
clared herself “thrilled” at the prospect.
My approval was not solicited.
Marion spent hour after hour sitting
for George. I naturally had moments of
uneasiness. For some reason George
had been brought up in the shelter of
Aunt . Phoebe’s home instead of in a
reformatory, and so had little sense of
property. My shirts, my underlinen, I
could afford to lose ; but there are limits.
Of course, I had confidence in his
aunt’s sensible attitude towards mar-
riage. She believed that a man should
have at least thirty years’ experience of
life before contemplating it; and
as she held the purse-strings I felt certain
that George would be unable to enter-
tain any ridiculous idea about Marion.
In fact, I felt that the experience his
company would provide would do her
good.
Being so impulsive, Marion was often
disposed to quarrel with me. In her
company I had become adept in avoid-
ing all subjects of a controversial nature.
Bitter innuendo and direct unpleasant-
ness alike found me slippery as an eel ;
but with George it was otherwise. Tem-
peramental and immature as he was, an
unseemly squabble was the breath of
life to him.
Through the partition I could hear
George entertaining her with amusing
anecdotes and hilarious sallies, and, as
l expected, sporadic bickering grew more
pronounced as the sittings went on. They
might have known each other for years,
so abandoned became their conversa-
tion.
These frequent sittings also deprived
me of Marion’s company. For instance,
when I would have liked to discuss
my plans for interesting my little
radio friends in the new de-luxe Toffee-
suckers she pleaded a prior engagement
with George. At times it seemed that
she took a distinct pleasure in avoiding
me, and often I regretted the many occa-
sions on which I had been of service to
George.
Naturally I refrained from mention-
ing the Peerless Art Outfit I had sent
to his aunt, beyond a casual hint to the
effect that I had actually paid for it. I
preferred to leave it to his conscience
when he received some practical recog-
nition of his Art.
George, I must explain, was a Neo-
Vorticist. I am prepared to believe that
he was influenced by the Surrealists and
perhaps somewhat by the Post-Impres-
sionists also, but on this I do not speak
authoritatively. Let it suffice to say
that a finished work from his brush pre-
sented a mystery so baffling that the
spectator sank all other emotions in vain
speculation as to the why and wherefore.
Whorls, cylinders and geometrical figures
vied for a place in the scheme of things
with disjointed fragments of the human
physiognomy. In this corner might be
a roving eye, cheek-by-jowl with a
shapely polygon, while on the other hand
a human ear consorted artistically with a
length of stovepipe.
I was in my room and standing by the
partition when I heard George declare
the portrait complete. The uproar that
followed made me glad that there was
a knothole between us. Marion, it

Film on teeth is dangerous!
Just look at film under the microscope
Queer germs live on your teeth. Science links them to
tooth decay , gum disorders , and many other troubles.
Germs are glued to teeth by an ever-forming film.
i
k
This is what the scientist finds
when ha analyses film on teeth
■4 A species of Lactobacilli now
* held responsible for tooth de-
cay by many scientists.
t% A species of Streptococcus
“ Pyogenes that may get into
the blood through the tissues
and cause serious infection.
You don’t need a micro-
scope to pick out film-
stained teeth. The naked
eye can’t miss them, for
film is ugly and dis-
gusting.
But where the naked
eye sees ugliness, the
microscope sees danger. Magnify film i ,000 times and
you will see living germs of many kinds. Look
especially at those rod-shaped ones in pairs and
groups—Lactobacilli is their scientific Latin name.
Destroyers of Lovely Teeth
Lactobacilli are the “germs of tooth decay.” They feed on
the particles of food that cling to the teeth. They give
off lactic acid that dissolves the tooth enamel, then devours
the part beneath. Finally the nerve is reached, causing
abscesses and often serious infection.
Lactobacilli appear in countless numbers. In fact, the film
scraped from a single tooth may easily contain millions of
living organisms. The only way science accepts of removing
germs from teeth is to remove the protective film-coat in
which they live and multiply. Film clings stubbornly. It
defies all ordinary ways of brushing. That’s why Pepsodent
laboratories have always centred their attention on the film-
removing properties of their tooth paste. Now these scien-
tific laboratories have developed a new and revolutionary
material for removing ugly, stubborn film. It is radically
different from any found in other tooth pastes —different in
composition and in action.
Some tooth pastes remove film with materials so bard that
they scratch the enamel. But the new material in Pepsodent
is soft —twice as soft as the material commonly used in
dentifrices. What’s more, it shows extraordinary power in
removing film and giving brilliant polish.
This new cleansing and polishing material is contained in
Pepsodent exclusively.

appeared, was seeing triangles and dis-
sected eyebrows for the first time.
George had refused to let her view the
masterpiece until it was finished.
He described it as a tour-de-force, the
answer for all time to the critics of Neo-
Vorticism. He announced that he would
exhibit it as a portrait of Marion Blake.
For enthusiastic insult, the next few
minutes were a record. I have no doubt
that had not George contrived to protect
his surprise for posterity with his own
body Marion would have ruined it with
a palette-knife.
She left, however, with a few more
remarks about his low nature and the ex-
pressed wish that the next time she came
to see him the cell would be locked and
the key lost.
I made no attempt to see her before
she left. The next day I telephoned her
house and arranged for her to come to
the studio that evening. Much to my
satisfaction, we were broadcasting The
Five Musical Amcebas in several numbers,
a supremely attractive offering.
Later I heard George in Conversation
with the charlady. “Alice,” he was say-
ing, “now that my big effort for the year
is finished, the studio might be improved
by a spring-clean. I’d like you to spend
the morning at it, but be careful of the
tour-de-force. If anything happened to’
that I might just as well jump over the
Bridge for all my career would be
worth.”
“Yes, Mr. Perry,” said Alice dutifully.
“And another thing. Mr. Pillbright, that
American gentleman, will send a man
for his picture—that one against the
wall. He is sailing on the Mongolia to-
day, and is forwarding a special packing
frame for it. He wants to keep it in
his stateroom or something of the kind.
See that he gets it, will you?”
“Very well, Mr. Perry.”
The door slammed.
I want to exonerate Alice from all sug-
gestion of blame. She came to me on
the personal recommendation of Mr. Gus
Machree, the popular wailing tenor
(exclusive to 2NK), and she has proved'
faithful beyond her years. It was Neo-
Vorticism that led to the confusion.
Regard any two Neo-Vorticist works any
way you will —through half-closed eyes,
using both hands as a kind Of funnel, or
with the head on one side—to the layman
they will be equally repulsive. And so
Mr. Pillbright’s man made at the worst
a pardonable mistake.
He took the tour-de-force.
It was mid-afternoon when I learned
of this. As I came in I noticed Alice’s
agitated behavior at the ’phone in the
hallway and stopped to inquire the cause.
“It’s gorn! The tore-de-foss —it’s gorn!
Oh, wot’ll I do?”
I elicited that she had done a good
deal. Unable to get George, she had
rung up numerous people whose names
she had heard him mention as friends,
including Aunt Phoebe and Marion. To
all of them she had repeated, “Mr. Perry,
he’s goin’ to jump over the Bridge. Oh,
wot’ll I do?” The cynical indifference
of some of his acquaintances and the
enthusiasm of others had done nothing
to allay her fears.
I steered her back to the studio and
tried to explain that George had spoken
figuratively, and that anyhow the
steamer had left by this, and no doubt
the picture would be sent back. George
walked in while I was trying to find a
couple of aspirins for her.
He was devastated.
“But surely you can dash off another
one,” I ventured.
“Dash off? Dash” I could see a
maniacal light in his eyes as he ceased
his striding to and fro. His voice took
on a grating note.
“Dash off a masterpiece! I might
expect that kind of thing from the hoi-
polloi”
At that moment the door burst open
and there stood Marion, panting and
wild-eyed. A moment she paused, and
then rushed into his arms. “Oh,
George,” she cried. “To think that you
were going to jump over the Bridge for
me! So wet, so cold” —her voice trailed
away in sobs.
There was not much time for adjust-
ment to this revelation before another,
still more shattering, was thrust upon us.
Again the door burst open.
There stood Aunt Phoebe —and what
an aunt!
A batik scarf of incredible artistry
hung about her shoulders. Gone were
the old-fashioned ringlets ; a wind-blown
bob had replaced them. The volumin-
ous skirt had given place to a form-
fitting garment that reached half-way
below her knees. Basket shoes and a
beret completed the ensemble.
George was patting Marion’s head
foolishly and crooning some drivel over
her, but on seeing his aunt he was
afflicted with a mental paralysis. He
stopped his crooning to mumble two or
three times “We are going to be mar-
ried.” It was left to me to explain the
loss of the tour-de-force and the char-
lady’s panic.
At the mention of the artistic, Aunt
Phoebe brightened. “A similar thing hap-
pened to me with my two best specimens
of pyrogravure. Left ’em in the tram,”
slje said cordially.
“What! You do poker work?” asked
George, who had been letting this new
surprise sink in.
“Pyrogravure,” she corrected him.
“Oh, of course, Aunt Phoebe ; poker
work-pyrogravure. But how did you?
How?”
“How did I find my Art?” she helped
him. “An extraordinary thing. Some
anonymous person sent me an outfit, and
after a little experiment I found I had
a talent for it. You can imagine the
surprise it was to me! That was ages
ago ; lately I have surprised myself even
more. I have the Soul, you know.”
It was clear that it would take George
some time to appreciate the changes
pyrogravure had wrought in his aunt.
“Have a chair?” he said.
She picked up a cushion. “Really, I
am never happier than when sitting
round the floor in my studio kit!” She
threw her beret under the table and
shook out her wind-blown bob. “But —
what were you saying about marriage?”
“We want to get married at once —
that is, with your approval, Aunt
Phoebe,” said George.
“Approval? I suppose so,” she said
vaguely. “I think your Art would benefit
from the experience. Broaden, as it were.
More Soul in it probably. And, after
all, what matters but Art?”
“T-thank you, Aunt Phoebe.”
“You had better see the solicitors.
With my hours occupied with creative
effort, I haven’t the time to look after
your affairs.”
Well, there it is. George is singing
“Ah! Moon of My Delight” and getting
into one of my dress shirts for the wed-
ding in an hour’s time. For the appear-
ance of the thing I bought them a silver
loving-cup tastefully embossed with a
poison-ivy design: £2 2s. at Bergbaum’s ;
mention 2NK.
The Inner Sight.
Unto whom the Sight is given cometh doubt or
sorrow never;
They have seen the truth unshadowed and
the Hidden Things made plain;
They have done with strife and passion and
their hearts are glad for ever:
In the dewtime and the daytime, in the
shadow and the rain.
This gift of God’s bestowing
Came down on us, that we,
From bonds of earth outgrowing,
Might know the Truth, and knowing
The Truth will “make us free,”
Will give to each the power
To reach the soul’s high tower
Of White Tranquillity;
To pierce the hidden wonder
Of all that earth may hold,
Of heavens, black with thunder,
And stormy seas that under
White miles of foam unfold;
Of dewy sheen adorning
The great green woods at morning,
The blue hills massed on gold.
When hope seems dead and ashen
The spirit blessed by Sight
Shall pierce through outward fashion,
Shall conquer sense and passion,
And say “There shall be light,”
As one who waits, unfearing,
To see the grey dusk clearing
For blue and silver night.

NELLIE A. EVANS.
In Hospital.
The dull monotony of endless days
Is broken only by the sound of feet,
And voices dimly heard, the patient’s bell,
The nurse’s coming and her quiet retreat.
Pain makes the silent progress of the dark
A dreaded thing the opiate cannot ease.
The cry goes up “Why didst Thou make the
night
So long, O Lord! Bring soothing daylight,
please! ”
Not mine the faith which clings to smug beliefs
That all is for the best, that God is Love,
Or that this pain which racks my tortured side
Brings tears to an all-seeing Eye above.
Rather I feel my flesh must take its load;
Only my manhood bids me grin and bear.
Easy to slip into the great beyond
And chance what fortune may provide me
there.
Then comes a knock upon my bedroom door:
My wife, my child, some friend, a flower or
two.
Earth calls me back; I smile; I clasp a hand.
What matters pain if I may walk anew!

The Anġel Child.
BY J. H. M. ABBOTT.
WHEN Captain Walter Urquhart, of
Poverty Plains, was killed by bush-
rangers at Fowler’s Crossing in
1838, his widow saw no reason why the
pioneering work he had begun should be
discontinued.
Poverty Plains was a pastoral hold-
ing, consisting of two big grants and a
large area held from the Crown at an
almost nominal rent; and Selina
Urquhart was singularly successful in her
manner of handling it. The first squat-
ters had arrived as landseekers from the
Hawkesbury with inadequate stores. They
had subsisted for months on ’possums
and kangaroos, varied by goanna, and
the hard living they endured had pro-
voked the name bestowed on what be-
came in a couple of decades one of the
finest estates in the Hunter Valley.
Those open grazing lands and river
flats, knee-deep in luscious grasses during
the good seasons, had little of poverty
about them in the worst, so that their geo-
graphical title, as set forth in the maps
prepared by the Surveyor-General’s De-
partment, was and is one of those public
jokes which have earned for Australians
a reputation for inverted humor.
The sole heir to this gracious demesne
with the ungracious name was Walter
Montgomery Urquhart, junior, who was
his mother’s pride and the bogey and
terror of everybody else who dwelt in
the neighborhood. When we make his
acquaintance he was ten years old, well
developed for his age and with the face
of one of those winged and bodiless
child-angels whom Sir Joshua Reynolds
set up as a standard for heavenly chil-
dren as depicted upon Christmas cards.
But most of the inhabitants of the dis-
trict believed that young Walter had him-
self set a standard for all the imps out
of Hell.
Mr. George Augustus Arragon, the
police magistrate at Maitland, rode, one
late afternoon in 1841, up to the front
door of the square sandstone homestead
at Poverty Plains, and handed his reins
to the groom, who had sauntered round
from the stables as the P.M. came pacing
sedately on his big black gelding, top-
hatted and eminently dignified, up the
drive that led to the house from the
Great Northern Road.
“Paddy,” said Mr. Arragon as he
alighted from the saddle, “is that young
devil at home, or is he still at Parra-
matta?”
“Ah, y’r Honor,” replied the man,
shaking his head, “he’s at home, thin,
warse luck. T’ree months he stayed at
Th’ King’s School, an’ thin give th’ place
leg bail. Stowed away in the steam-
packet at Sydney, so he did, and walked
home from Morpeth. Bad luck to th’
little baste—’tis not a moment’s pace
have we had since th’ spalpeen come
back. That lad’ll be hung wan o’ thim
days—an’ th’ sooner th’ betther. But
he’s Angel Child to th’ Madam —God
bless her —jist th’ same as iver he was.”
“Ah, well,” muttered Mr. Arragon as
he mounted the steps leading on to the
wide verandah, “I suppose each one of
us has his cross to bear! Don’t take the
horse to the stables, Paddy. Keep him
here, will you? He doesn’t need a drink
—I watered him at the river. I shall be
returning to Maitland within the hour.”
“Very good, y’r Honor,” answered the
groom. Then, “Why th’ divil d’ye want
to come at this time, an’ me wid a dozen
things to do afore ’tis dark?”
He had been walking the black horse
co and fro for little more than five
minutes when round the corner of the
house came a boy, whistling, who stood
with his hands in his pockets surveying
the groom and his charge with wide and
beautiful blue eyes that had an aspect
in them of almost babyish innocence. A
beautiful boy he was, with a most attrac-
tive air of frank and lovable goodness
about him.
“Whose horse is that, Paddy?” he in-
quired of the groom as the latter turned
and faced him. A sweet and musical
voice the little fellow had, that went well
with his lovely countenance. “Not a bad
sort, is he?”
“ ’Tis th’ Polis Magistrate’s horse—him
bein’ inside, a-callin’ on th’ Madam. See
here, Wally darlint” —a bright idea came
to Paddy the groom —“Misther Arragon’s
not shtoppin’ long, an’ I’ve forty things
wants doin’ this blissed minute. Will ye
not hould him for a while, an’ let me
be off about me worruk? Sure, ’tis him-
self’ll be givin’ ye half a crown whin he
comes out —mebbe half a sov’reign.”
“Last time he was here, he said he’d
give me ad and good lift under the
ear,” replied the boy. “But I’ll hold him,
Paddy—if you’ll let me ride Blue Peter
to-morrow. Is it a bargain?”
“Sure, ye couldn’t hould him.”
“All right, then; you hold this one,
laughed the boy as he turned towards
the verandah. He stopped at the steps
and looked round provokingly. “Well,
what about it, Paddy?”
“Aw —all right! All right! What’s it
to me if ye break y’r precious neck, ye
young divil? But if he t’rows ye, ye must
tell th’ Madam ye tuk him widout per-
mission, else there’ll be hell to nay for
poor Paddy. All right—grab a holt o’
this baste, an’ ye can have Blue Pether.
I’ve no time to waste here. Don’t let
him go, now.”
So Master Walter Urquhart took
charge of Mr. Arragon’s horse, and led
him quietly to the far side of the terrace
in front of the house. Here he halted
and plucked a thorny Scotch thistle,
which he carried in his left hand as he
walked back across the top of the drive,
whistling quietly. He led Mr. Arragon’s
horse out of sight of the drawing-room
windows, round the end of the house._
In the meantime the arbiter of sum-
mary justice in Maitland was alone in
the dark, cool drawing-room with Sally
Urquhart. Obviously he had some stand-
ing at Poverty Plains. This was evident
from the fact that one of his strong arms
encircled her slim waist and his whisk-
ered and handsome face was bent down
to hers, whilst they stood close together
on the hearthrug in earnest and intimate
communion.
The queen regent of Poverty Plains
was a beautiful woman, slim and grace-
ful, with a mass of red-gold hair piled
high above her shapely head. That the
young boy leading Mr. Arragon’s horse
up and down outside the house should
have the features of an angel was easily
understandable by anyone who met his
mother. Only those who had known his
dead father could properly comprehend
why the lad belied his looks.
Mr. Arragon was one of these. He had
no illusions as to the angelic character of
the offspring of the woman he loved.
“Well, then, my dear, ’tis all settled,”
the P.M. was saying. “You will drive
into Maitland to-night and put up at
the Northumberland Hotel, going on
down to Morpeth in the morning to
catch the steam packet to Sydney. I will
board her at Newcastle to-morrow, and
as soon as we arrive in Sydney we will
go straight to St. Philip’s Church and
get married. Do these plans meet with
your approval, my beloved?”
“Perfectly, darling—perfectly. By elop-
ing, as it were, in this way, we will avoid
all the fuss and curiosity I had to endure
when I married poor Walter, and the
affair will be entirely our own. I do
wish, however, that we might take the
Angel Child with us, but I suppose
'twould never do?”
“Of course not, my love. Naturally”
—Mr. Arragon very naturally lied—“I
should be delighted to have the dear
little fellow with us on our honeymoon,
but he would be so dreadfully bored.
’Twouldn’t be a bit fair to the boy. Much
better to leave him here and allow your
housekeeper, Mrs. Simmons, to break the
news to him to-morrow when he misses
you. Much better, I think.”
“You will always be kind to him*
Augustus?”
“How could I help it, my love? The
dear little fellow!”
“He really is a Little Angel!”
“One of the cherubim, sweetheart. But
I must be returning. Until we meet on
board the Shamrock to-morrow at New-
castle. This —and this! ”
“There, that will do! Until to-mor-
row. I’ll watch you ride away from the
window —I love seeing you on that black
horse. Good-bye, my darling. Take
care of yourself until ’tis my privilege
to take care of you.”
During the next few minutes Mr.
George Augustus Arragon was so fully
occupied in taking care of himself that
the bitterness of his temporary severance
from the beautiful creature with whom
he had so affectionately parted in the
drawing-room did not prey upon his
mind. Half a golden sovereign had been
generously bestowed upon the Angel
Child before he took the reins from that
lovely innocent and mounted into the
saddle. Then the black horse had reared,
leaped forward with frenzied energy and
departed down the carriage drive in a
series of energetic bucks that exacted all
the horsemanship the P.M. had at his
command.
The horse then bolted, and was only
brought to a standstill by the high
wrought-iron gates at the side of the
road, a quarter of a mile from the house.
With a breathless “Whoa, lad!” Mr.
Arragon slipped from the saddle he had

experienced such difficulty in sticking to,
and loosened the girths. He lifted the
seat of the saddle. The crushed spiky
head of a Scotch thistle rolled to the
ground.
“Angel Child! ” muttered Mr. Arragon
bitterly. He looked up the slope towards
the house. The dancing figure of a small
boy was discernible upon the verandah,
and he was waving a handkerchief.
“My God! ” cried the angry man. “I’ll
be a father to him! ”
He opened the gate, mounted and rode
away.
Twenty-four hours later the Shamrock
berthed in Darling Harbor, and Mr.
Arragon and his bride walked slowly
up the hill in a transverse direction north-
eastward until they came to St. Philip’s
Parsonage, where they were welcomed
by the Rev. William Cowper, a frail and
benign old man, who was then drawing
towards the close of his long incumbency
of Sydney’s first parish.
“Ah, my dear Mr. Arragon and Mrs.
Urquhart!” He welcomed them with a
smile. “I had your letter, my dear sir,
and everything is ready and prepared
for the ceremony. Including the wit-
nesses. But will you not partake of
some refreshment first of all after your
voyage? No? Well, then, come along.”
It was growing dusk as the three of
them, followed by the parish clerk and
his wife, in the capacity of witnesses to
the impending ceremony, passed by the
queer round tower that stood at the
eastern end of old St. Philip’s. None
of them observed a small boy who
dodged into the entrance that looked
down Church Hill as they turned the
corner of the building.
They went into the silent church, where
the clerk lit a couple of lamps near the
altar, and Mr. Cowper retired to the
vestry to don his surplice and bands.
Bride and bridegroom stood waiting for
the clergyman in the chancel, whilst the
two witnesses seated themselves in pews
near the front of the church.
Mr. Cowper, prayer-book in hand,
had just emerged from the vestry when
suddenly a shrill scream shattered the
silence of the empty church. Out of
the gloom at its western end it echoed
through the building, and the startled
group of three before the altar stood
transfixed with astonishment. Only the
parish clerk was equal to the occasion.
That cool-headed functionary rose to
his feet, stepped out of the pew and ran
swiftly down the aisle. There was a
sound of scuffling in the dark distances
of the sacred building, the noise of a
small boy trying to yell and having his
yells suppressed by a hand over his
mouth. Dimly, they could see the clerk
carrying a struggling body to the door,
with something of difficulty but with
ultimate success. Two minutes he was
absent, and then returned on tiptoe up
the aisle, whilst the amazed wedding-
party waited. In a husky whisper the
clerk reassured the clergyman.
“ ’Tis all right now, sir—you may go
on. I’ve locked him in the toolhouse.”
So, in due form, George Augustus
Arragon and Selina Urquhart were
united in the holy bonds of matrimony.
“And now,” said the bridegroom as
they left the church, “what of our unin-
vited guest? Let us see him, Mr. Clerk,
if you please. But what are you carry-
ing? Surely”
“ ’Tis a loaded pistol, y’r Honor. The
young ruffian was a-going to fire it at
you ! ”
He led them through a gate to a small
shed in a corner of the parsonage garden
and unbolted the door. A small figure
emerged immediately and ran to the
bride.
“My Angel Child!” she screamed as
she clasped him in her arms. “How came
you here, Walter? Oh, my goodness—
how dirty you are!”
“Behind the carriage to Maitland,
mamma, and then I walked to Morpeth.
I came down in the steamboat. I read
a letter you left on your table, so I knew
to come here. I meant to shoot that
man! ”
Mr. Cowper gasped.
“My boy! My boy! What are you
saying?”
“Selina,” said Mr. Arragon gently. “I
can see that your son’s angelic instincts
cannot be denied. We will take him to
Petty’s with us. Come, Walter—come,
my boy. We’ll see —what we’ll see !”
“My Angel Child!” murmured the
mother. “How loving of him, Augustus.
How devoted to me! The darling!
Come, Walter dear. Mr. Arragon will
be a father to you.”
“Yes,” said Mr. Arragon, “and he’ll
begin to-night. With a strap!”

that was), but Rose had told him that
they’d got out and eaten all her young
silver-beet down to the ground Friday.
(Good thing, too.) And there he was,
tapping away there with his bit of a
hammer. And they’d get out again,
Monday or Tuesday, and pull the silver-
beet up by the roots. (Good thing, too.)
Grandfer had offered to make the pen
fowlproof for her ; but she’d said no —
better let Bill be responsible. Bill! A
big overgrown lout of a b0y....
That din back in the house was Rose
and a couple of women magging in the
living-room. Neighbors come to call on
Rose for a bit of a chat. That was the
row you could hear—the bit of a chat.
Presently they’d all have a cup of tea —
no, they wouldn’t. They’d come and yell
for Bill to take ’em all for a run in
the car first (after they’d edged Grandfer
off somewhere else), and they’d all come
back and slosh tea into themselves when
the car-ride was over. But by that time

The door from the living-room opened
with a rush that made him jump in his
chair, and Rose bustled out. (Bustling
sort of woman, Rose, especially when
she was in her Sunday clobber.) She
smiled heartily at him and patted his
shoulder, continuing to smile into his
disgruntled face. (How Bill ever came
to marry a woman like this—you’d think
she’d drive him stone-mad.)
“Now, Grandfer,” she said as if it was
his fault but she forgave him, “isn’t it I
about time for your little Sunday-after-
noon stroll? The sun’s nice and warm
now—just right. But it won’t stay just
right, you know —not for you.”
He got ready to shift out of his chair.
“Shall I take young Rosalie with me, my
dear?” he asked in forlorn hope. “I’d be
careful”....
“Oh no,” she said soothingly. “I
don’t think so, thank you, Grandfer. She
might get away from you”
“I’d hold her hand all the time,” he
promised, the forlorn hope already dead.
“No,” she repeated firmly. “She’s
so quick, you know, dear. And the
roads are always full of rushing cars
on Sunday afternoon. Besides, I think
her daddy’s going to take her and all of
us for a little motor-run before after-

where you could be anything. One time
he’d been a larrikin youth, full of him-
self, cock of the walk ; Sunday arvo was
a great time then. An hour shaving and
getting into your flash clobber; a walk
round the roads with a couple of mates,
maybe a girl or two, a bit of a sing-
song and a bottle or two —who cared?
Again one time, a year or two later,
he’d been king of the world on Sunday
arvo. He cared then all right. That
was Molly. How his heart used to jump
into his throat at the sight of her; and
how the road they walked on was a
soft carpet in Heaven. He couldn’t
believe it was himself; remembering on
this old bench by the waterside he could
hardly believe it yet. Sunday arvos....
no one in the world could show any
Sunday arvos like those. Not with that
kick in them and that wonderful lift.
Molly Molly—he wasn’t edged away
then.
The shadow of a cloud slipped over
the water, came gently to his feet, and
vanished. It wasn’t too bad sitting here
tired out; you got a rest in the silence
and the calm.
Other Sundays crowded in. Himself
a bit quieter, more settled; pushing
young Bill along the road in his pram,
Molly beside him and both of them as
proud as Punch. They were good, those
Sundays ; he had something of his own
then. Life that he’d made —life to go on
after him —life that needed him.
You could get a bit of a sleep here
by the water if you felt like it. The
water and the sky and Mangrove Moun-
tain dark with bush over there —it was
all silent and half asleep already —
Sunday-arvo feeling about it.
Or, later, going for a bit of a stroll
with Molly to shake the Sunday dinner
down. Young Bill would have nicked
off with some mates or on his own, and
a quiet stroll without his clatter was a
let-off. And they enjoyed it, too, Molly
and he —a comfortable talk about old
times and maybe the times to come
Happy, happy Sunday arvos
But it was fair enough. They’d all got
their lives to live —what room in their
lives was there for an old dud living
with his son and daughter-in-law be-
cause there was no other place for him?
Why should they be bothered with him?
Grandfer’s eyes closed a moment.
That flicker in his chest again—queer....
and not so clever. He kept his eyes
closed another moment.
Only—no place: nothing of your own.
Molly was the only one who’d be both-
ered with him year in, year out. And
she was dead these thirty years. You
couldn’t expect much now.
This old cove at the other end of the
bench —funny: he hadn’t seen or heard
him come up And there he was sit-
ting there, looking out across the water
to the further shore.
Presently he turned to Grandfer and
smiled. “Good day,” he said.
Queer. This old cove’s smile —Grand-
fer watched his face—Molly and young
Bill as a baby and Rosalie.... Grandfer
gazed at him a bewildered moment.
“Good day, mister,” he faltered, trying
to withdraw his gaze.
The cove laughed, a gentle, comfort-
able laugh. “What’s up?” he asked.
“You look all bothered and”
“I am bothered,” the cove’s laugh made
Grandfer at home at once, “fair both-
ered I’m stuck out here on me own
on this bit of a bench —and on Sunday
arvo” Grandfer told him his
troubles.
“I don’t know why I should tell all
this to you, mister”
“Why not?” the soothing music of the
cove’s voice asked —queer: you could
swear he was Molly and Bill and Rosalie
and Grandfer’s mother and a whole raft
of happy, peaceful things in seventy-
seven years —the music fell deeper:
“Why shouldn’t you bring it to me?”
He turned and looked across the water
again, to the other shore and the moun-
tain’s heavy shoulders dark with bush.
Tired —tired
“You see,” Grandfer murmured, his
voice thin and sleepy, “it’s having no
place of —of me own”
“What about coming to us?” the music
lapsed softly into its place with the water
and the sky and the mountain. “There’s
a good many of us. But there’s a spare
room. And you’re welcome It’s
a small room. And narrow” —Grandfer’s
head had fallen forward on to his chest;
there was a heavy buzzing in his ears —
“but it’s your own. And quiet and
peaceful”....
“Why, thank ye yes, mister,”
Grandfer roused himself for a last
earthly moment. “I’d be glad— to come.
Real glad”
The flicker in his chest heaved once up
into tumult and was still, the shell of
Grandfer being alone on the bench this
Sunday arvo.
A Song of Sydney City.
[George Cochrane (Grant Hervey ) wrote these
extraordinary lines during one of the experi-
ences that blighted his career. S. H. Prior —
always generous to the man who was down —
accepted them, but decided that publication
would not help the writer, and the MS. was
found among the editor’s papers after his
death. Cochrane himself died in a Melbourne
hospital last month. The verses exhibit his
strength and his weakness.]
She’s a leopard,
She’s a lion.
She’s a tiger,
She’s a cat —
She’s a feline jungle creature, fanged and fear-
less at the core:
In the soul of Sydney city there’s the black-
ness of the bat,
And the leaping forest fierceness of the panther
splashed with gore.
In her boiling blood there’s battle, in her eyes
the primal fire
Of the wild thing, fighting blindly for the safety
of her cubs;
And I’d rather starve in Sydney in the in-
candescent mire
Than be housed in solemn Melbourne in the
toniest of pubs.
I’ve gone back myself to Nature, so I hate
the Yarra-side,
And I loathe those righteous suburbs where
the stupid persons dwell.
Give me gaol at Parramatta —give me
Bathurst, open wide;
For I’d rather be a convict in his Majesty’s
hotel.
Give me Sydney, feline Sydney, all the days
that I exist —•
Thus I conquer thee, O city, where my little
son was born!
Son beloved, son of sadness, son I’ve starved
for, cherished, kissed —
Here I fling your fighting standard to the
everlasting morn.
Little jaguar.
Little giant,
Little wild thing,
Little man —
When you struck this earth, my pocket held a
single lonely “brown”;
Dreadful days we knew together, she who
bore you—for a span
Life was Hell unleashed and awful, and she
wore the martyr’s crown.
Dared to love and cling together! That’s
our unforgiven crime—
Do we care what saints are howling like jackals
outside the door?
There they stuck the tracts, dear Christians,
full of unctuous, pious slime —
Damned, dead souls a dying epoch flings upon
Perdition’s shore!
Days of hunger, days of fighting, hours of
tramping through the night,
When, the rain stabbed down upon me, tramp-
ing homeless through the streets;
Still, we faced, we fought that battle, little
son, and life grew bright
When the beer and beef were stolen, and strong
hands brought home the eats.
We were down-and-out, my baby! We were
outcasts from the pole—
Thus we conquer thee, O city, thus we triumph
in our sin;
For I learned to laugh at prisons—yea, I
laugh to-day in gaol,
And the down-and-out will shortly be the victor,
up and in.
Son most splendid,
Son beloved,
Son of Dearest,
Son of mine —
Live to fight the world and tame it, live to be
a jungle man;
Spurn and mock meek saints and credos —
leave their gospels to the swine—
Ride upon this city’s shoulders and be leader
of the clan.
Sydney owns thee, Sydney bore thee —unto
Sydney be the praise,
Unto thee the plunder-profit in the days that
are to come;
Learn to know this city-panther—thou shall
rule her all thy days—
Wake her pride and lust of battle with thy
detonating drum!
Give her gospels charged with anger, give
her words of sudden ire—
Beat her breasts with fists of , iron and be
ruthless in thy rage;
’Tis a city strange and feral! Whip her well
with whips of wire—
Be the master! That or nothing! She will
bring to thee thy wage.
She’s a city like none other, she’s a city proud
and still —
Thus I conquer thee, O tiger, lying prone
beside thy seas;
And I introduce thy master —learn to know
and do his will —
In this little child now standing like a Viking
’twixt my knees.
City leopard,
City lion,
City tiger,
City cat —
Here’s a man I’ve bred to rule you in the
days that are to come;
Son of passion! Son of suffering! By the
gaols where I have sat,
I proclaim him king and master, and I beat his
battle-drum.
Not from Bethlehem the leader for this city
by the sea—
Not from Nazareth the master, but from prisons
and from gaols;
Never bend to sect or schism, never bend an
humble knee,
For humility is hated on the soil of New South
Wales.
Ere the gates of doom reopen, I would sing
this savage song—
Sing to thee, O feline creature, fanged and
fearless at the core;
I, the convict, give thee Manhood —give my
son, and, right or Wrong,
He shall be thy feudal master, lord of peace
and lord of war.
Take my gift, O jungle city! Draw him
closer to thy heart —
Thus I conquer thee, O Sydney, not with words
of bitter scorn;
Years of sadness, be forgiven! Son of love,
I know thou art
As a flag—a fighting standard flung above the
smiling morn.
N.S.W.
GRANT HERVEY.

* This illustration
explains the Porosity
of the Willard Thread
Rubber Insulator.
Porosity simply means free flow of the bat-
tery acids through the insulator between each
positive and negative plate. The illustration
above shows clearly the tiny threads or wicks
which carry the acid through. There are
5,000 of these wicks to the square inch in the
Willard Threaded Rubber Insulator. This
means easier and quicker starting for you
under all conditions! Practically 85% of all
battery faults are due to the premature
failure of conventional insulators. Buy a
Willard Thread Rubber Battery.
save the life of the
Willard Battery!
INSULATION! . . . that’s the job of the Willard Patented Threaded
Rubber Insulator. It must separate each positivie plate of the battery
from the negative. The better it does this, the longer the battery lives!
That’s why Willard uses rubber as insulation!
When you buy a Willard Thread Rubber Battery you get this Patented
Threaded Rubber Insulator, which has an insulating quality higher
than any other insulator used! This Willard Insulator is so strong
that it actually outlives the plates! Yet is thoroughly porous, allowing
the battery acids to flow freely at all times —which means that the
maximum power supply is always ready.*
A Willard Thread Rubber Battery will give you real economy. You’ll
get quicker starts and better service under all conditions —longer
battery life —and your upkeep will be less! Ask your dealer about
the Willard Thread Rubber Battery!
