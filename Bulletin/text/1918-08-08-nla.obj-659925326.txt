Simple and Effective Methods.
By Olga Amsdell, Special Correspondent,
London, Eng.
To Kill Roots of Superfluous Hair.
Women annoyed with disfiguring growths
of superfluous hair wish to kuow not merely
how to temporarily remove the hair, but how
to kill the hair permanently. For this
purpose pure powdered pheminol may be
applied directly to the objectionable hair-
growth. The recommended treatment is
designed not only to instantly remove the
hair, but to actually kill the roots so that
the growth will not return. About an ounce
of pheminol. obtainable from the chemist,
should be sufficient.
Removing Her Skin.
The quickest and surest way to make a
good complexion out of a bad one is to
actually remove the thin veil of faded or dis-
colored outer skin from the face. This can
be done easily, safely and privately by any
woman. The process is one of gentle absorp-
tion.
Get some pure mercolised wax from your
chemist and apply it at night like cold cream,
washing it off in the morning. In a few
days the mercolide in the wax will have
absorbed the disfiguring cuticle, revealing
the fresh young skin underneath; you will
have a beautiful, clear, natural complexion.
The process is pleasant and harmless, making
the face look brilliantly attractive and youth-
ful. It also effectually removes such blem-
ishes as freckles, tan, moth patches, liver
spots, pimples, etc. Every woman should
beep a little mercolised wax on hand, as this
simple, old-fashioned remedy is the best com-
plexioned beautifler and preserver known.
Blackheads Instantly Go.
A very simple, harmless and pleasant pro-
cess is now used to remove blackheads and
correct greasiness and large pores in the
skin. You have only to drop a tablet of
stymol, obtained from the chemist, into a
glass of hot water and bathe the face with
the liquid after the effervescence has sub-
sided. The blackheads will then come right
off on the towel. The enlarged pores immedi-
ately contract to normal and the greasiness
disappears, leaving the skin smooth, soft and
cool and free from blemish. But to make sure
that, this desirable result is permanent it is
advisable to repeat the treatment several
times at intervals of say about four or five
days.
Grey Hair Unnecessary.
One need not resort to the very question-
able expedient of hair dye in order not to
have grey hair. The grey hair can easily be
changed back to a natural color in a few
days’ time merely by the application of a
simple, old-fashioned and perfectly harmless
home-made lotion. Procure from your chem-
ist: two ounces of tainmalite concentrate and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum. Apply
this to the hair a few times with a small
sponge, and you will soon have the pleasure
of seeing your grey hair gradually darkening
to the desired shade. The lotion is pleasant,
not sticky or greasy, and does not injure the
hair in any way.
Naturally Wavy Hair.
Good stallax not only makes the best possi-
ble shampoo, but has the peculiar property of
leaving the hair with a pronounced natural
“wave,” an effect presumably desired by many
ladies. A teaspoonful of the stallax granules,
dissolved in a cup of hot water, is ample for
a luxurious head wash, and leaves the hair
with a peculiar lustre and fluffiness obtainable
from nothing else as far as known. It is per-
fectly haittnless, and can be obtained from
most chemists, although since it has been but
little used for this purpose it comes only in
lib sealed original packages, enough to make
up 25 or 30 individual shampoos. [2

AFRAID OF FOOD.
Sufferers from Indigestion very often become faddists as regards their food, and find
themselves in time reduced to a very meagre and unsatisfying diet. Hudson s Eumenthol
Jujubes correct acidity of the stomach, and their antiseptic properties prevent abnormal
fermentation of the food, thus allowing the
natural digestive ferments to act, and if
taken regularly after meals they so improve
the digestion that a strict diet becomes
unnecessary. Hudson’s Eumerithol Jujubes
are most useful to those who suffer from
Heartburn. Flatulence and Dyspepsia.

An Irish Heart
If Ireland hadn’t been invented Song
might have run a risk of being homeless.
That was, of course, until Australia was
invented, for this country has been always
willing to give the lady the best seat by the
fire in the short winter and by the ice-
chest in the long summer. David McKee
Wright’s fascinating book isn’t all Ireland
by any means. Some of it is Maoriland.
Some of it is Fairyland. Some of it, being
ocean, may be classed with the Kingdom of
the Sealand which once led a precarious
existence at the head of the Persian Gulf.
There are bits about Lotus Land, and about
the Norland in days when the sign hung up
in front of the smithy: “Thor, late Tubal
Gain, Ironmonger. Repairs Neatly Exe-
cuted.” There is a glance at Creation;
which consisted in the making of Ireland
and its surroundings. Immortality and
Watson's Bay get a mention.
Still the Irish element is strongest. The
country lends itself to poetry, in theory at
least. The grass is green all the year
round, whereas the demand for the poem
about drought and cow’s bones is limited.
The sea is green or blue or grey or any
other good old color, and the shores are
rocky and tall. This is as things should, be,
for the ode to a yellow shore one inch high,
edged by a brown sea one inch deep, is yet
unwritten and deserves to remain so. The
thatched roof is a fitting post of outlook for
the singer, while the hot, greasy, galvanised-
iron roof, with the birds slithering off it in
disgust for lack of a foothold, is accursed.
Even Milton’s epic on a galvanised-iron roof
fell flat. Then Father O’Brien represents
a family that was old before the first Hohen-
zollern left a wavy, footless track in the
dust; also he stands for a Church which has
at least the dignity of age, so much wanting
among the Shaker community.
And David McKee Wright has all these
properties in his soul and at the end of his
pen. He supplies girls—-Roseen, Norah.
Pegeen, Aideen, Rona, Athene, Moincen,
Margaret, Murna, Ilosaleen, also anonymous
girls, likewise other girls ; and they are lov-
able girls every one, with music in their
hearts and their feet and a star in each eye.
Barring Deborah, who is omitted for wearing
goggles, and Jemima, who is naturally an
ungathered middle-aged blossom with large
feet, every kind of maiden seems to be repre-
sented. And the immortals —mostly small
female immortals- —who go about doing good
deeds, would make up for the lack of girls
if there was a lack of girls, which there
isn’t, seeing that there is much girl. These
People of the Hills never came to Australia,
worse luck. They were scared away by the
Public Debt.
A careful search has failed to reveal either
whisky, rum, porter or beer in this volume,
but “Wreckers,” a story of how the wine-
ship came ashore, makes amends. It may
be described as a wholesale order.
The author of “An Irish Heart” doesn’t
exactly aim high. He just gets there.
There are two ways of reaching a mental
height. One is by happening to be born
there, which applies in this case. The other
is by laboriously climbing per ladder, which
may prove too short after all, leaving the
climber marooned in the air half-way up.
David McKee Wright doesn’t seek —at least
he doesn’t seek in this particular volume —
to be the poet of revolution or reconstruc-
tion, to drag the -oppressor and the vampire
down by the feet, to do the flammenwerfer
act on the monstrous but; uninsured edifice
of tyranny, to rebuild fallen peoples or re-
store lost civilisations, or to do extensive
bone-setting repairs on a globe that is out of
joint. .These things are left over till his
busy day. Meanwhile he tries to make the
globe feel happier with visions and dreams
and patches of color and the harmonies of
the clouds and the winds and the sea, and
does the work well. Even the utilitarian
mind can’t call it labor in"vain. If one must
leave the book to return to sordid concerns
like the removal of the Prussian and his
brother the ash-barrel, he will return with
renewed energy and a stronger purpose.
(An Irish Heart, by David McKee Wright,
Angus and Robertson, Sydney.)
Warfare
A neat little pocket-volume of verses, by
OMJara Wood, The Wings of Death and
Other Verses About the War (Specialty
Press, Melb.), commends itself by its dedica-
tion “To my two sons, who have been, for
nearly three years and still are, fighting on
behalf of their mother, of their sister, and of
me, who am ineligible, and of others who
could, but will not, fight.” o’llara Wood’s
songs of warfare have more blood in them
than he used to put into the rhymes of “It.
K. Dee” in his younger days. Take the
latter half of the name-piece in the booklet:
I’m flying a race against Death to-night,
All around are bursting the woolly white shells,
Though they’re seeking my soul ’tis a glorious sight,
A galaxy grand of potential hells.
We do not love the music tiiey sing,
My engine is straining with panting breath,
For she knows full well as a living thing,
They must fly fast who fly against Death.
1 call to my engine, and bid her stay,
For I see the flares near the darkened town,
And she answers my mood as she does alwav,
And is silent whilst we are gliding down.
Then I croon to my ’plane of our good work done,
For she and I in our souls are one
In our wholesome hate of the loathsome Hun.
And we’ll dream our dreams when we’re snugly home
In the cloistered calm of our aerodrome.
The last of the little set of 12 v.erselets is
“Coo-ee,” a wireless from Flanders to the
stay-at-homes :—-
Are they more precious than ours, your lives?
Or are you held in the leading strings
Of mothers, sisters, sweethearts or wives?
Who love you now, but would surely hate
If you suffer them share the Belgians’ fate;
The smallest bird will fight for its mate,
And you—you have eagles’ wings,
Fly straight to our aid, lest it be too late,
This warning my coo-ee brings.

There’s a World of Proof that
“Adamax” is the Best Roofing Value.
Conviction that “Here is the common-sense Roofing” flashes in upon you when you consider how
“Adamax” Roofing is securing the “Plums” of the roofing orders of Australia.
43f miles of “Adamax” Roofing are being used on the Wool=storage
Buildings erected in Wentworth Park, Sydney, by Messrs. Stuart Bros,
for the Central Wool Committee.
13 miles of “Adamax” Roofing have just been ordered by the Imperial
Authorities in Perth for the West Australian Wool Stores.
44,000 sq. yds. of “Adamax” were ordered for use on the South Australian Wheat Board
Buildings.
22,000 sq. yds. were used on the Commonwealth Buildings at Molongo, Canberra.
20,000 sq. yds. on the Leeton Canning Factories.
13,200 sq. yds. on the West Australian Freezing Works at Wyndham.
Think a bit now! We would never have secured these orders unless we had a better roofing to offer
—unless we cmild show the men who placed those orders that they would get their money’s worth
in lnncror QOT'xri n o an rl in err* a a tor* rl r\ m from unlroon
in longer service and in greater freedom from upkeep expense.

can secure such orders in the face of all competition, surely it is worth

Without constant, every-day health, vigour is impossible
your body must be kept to concert pitch. Your mind cannot be
alert and vigorous if your body is slack, listless and enervated.
Every day, as regularly as you wind up your watch, you
must wind up your system, in order that, purified
and vitalized, it shall run smoothly all day long.

Corporal Jones.
Corporal Jones had a friend they say:
Gay Corporal Jones !
They lived together and went aivay
To the Field of War with its blood and its
bones. .
Then somehow it happened that in the end
The General noticed the Corporal’s friend.
He noticed the Corporal’s friend was slow,
So he took him away and away below,
For he breathed with a gasping breath.
Now, the General’s name was General Death,
But the friend didn’t know.
Corporal Jones has a Sergeant now
As a constant friend !
They live alone in the town somehow,
And they’ll live together until the End,
In a little dark house—in a little room
With a wonderful quiet as still as a tomb.
And never a terror the Corporal owns,
Though the Sergeant whispers in terrible
tones
Of the fate of the pal who was slain;
For the Sergeant’s name is Sergeant Pain.
Poor Corporal Jones!

Love o’ the Sea.
“Ob, will you come flitting?” said Someone
to me,
“The moon has poured wine in the bowl of
the sea,
The moon has splashed light on the too
many stars,
Their eyes without number
Are dazzled to slumber;
Soft glories of dusk veil the poor old earth’s
scars ,
And a liouey-gold robe weds the sky and the
sea.
Oh, won’t you come flitting?” sighed Someone
to me.
I gave her my hand and she led me away..
We ran out dry-foot on the chrysolite bay,
We tiptoed the slopes of irresolute Waves
And often peeped under
To kingdoms of wonder .
Where gleaming things writhed in their
watery caves;
And once we stood still on the rippling high-
way ,
While a nautilus fleet shimmered over the
bay.
The sleepy bright moonlights were rocked
on the sea,
And ever her eyes drew the heartstrings ot
me .
As on through the sparkle and spindrift we
fled.
With phantasies thronging
Woke memory and longing:
“Who are you?” I cried, but “I know not,
she said ;
“Am I Joy, or Adventure? ’Tis equal to me;
My lovers have guessed me as Love o’ the
Sea.”
She taught me strange lore ’twixt the day
and the day. „ , . ,
She plied me with vintage of sharp winds
and spray, „ ,
Then back through the torment of madness
divine
She guided me fleetly,
And once, turning sweetly,
She laid for a moment her lips upon mine;
And the kiss of her mouth which is cold to
this day , ....
Was as light and as swift and as bitter as
spray.
Oh, wildly she sighed her farewell on the
shore! . T
“To some I come once, but to none come l
My lovers are goaded by passions like whips
And finding me never
Go thirsting for ever,
The sting of my kiss burning salt on tneir
And 'now' the earth stirs me to gladness no
Dry-hearted in exile, a shell the shore.^
VICTORIA.
ELSIE COLE.
The Loom.
From my unsatisfied desire
I shape the radiance of a rose;
To twisted threads of golden fire
The web that is a love-tale grows.
I pattern colors ripe and rare
On the grey ground of my despair .
Sometimes I note a trembling leaf
That stencils beauty ; on the tree
A poinsiana’s red relief
Against an ochre balcony ;
A thin fine spire upon the blue —
I steal their brave design for you !
The soft monotonies of rain, _
The sun's triumphant ambermg
I rifle these to spin again. .
I blend the winter with the Spring.
A prize for treasure-chest to prove
When placed upon the loom of love!
Men do not guess who see me dream,
And think me diffident or cold,
How in my heart the magics gleam
Of emerald, amethyst or gold :
That these sly pixies of the brain
May take their choice from many a skem.
And all for you, my Secret Love!
The colors on the frame are set
With scarlets, leaping blood to prove,
And passionate tones of violet, •
While mind and sense and soul compete
To weave a carpet for your feet!

THURSDAY, AUGUST 8. 1918.
A HOMELESS, HOUSELESS FOLK.
An uncanny feeling is abroad that this great
country may shortly have to build itself a
gunyali, or else sleep out with its clothes and
furniture and groceries around it and its
money in a bag hanging from a tree. Some-
how it is forgetting how to build houses,
as it forgot bow to build ships. The com-
plaint is heard in various States, but most of
all in N. S. Wales, which leads the way in
so many things. Lithgow, Wagga. Goul-
burn, Lismore, Sydney (most of all) and
quite a number of other places are in dis-
tress. In Sydney the amount spent on new
buildings for the year ended June, 1918, was
rather less than half that spent for the year
to June. 1914, and by reason of the increase
in wages and tlie/vgst increase in the cost of
material the ever-growing city didn't get any-
thing like half the quantity of new house for
half the money. Lithgow, of course, was au
exceptional case. The Commonwealth Gov-
ernment created an arms factory there which
employed a very large number of men until
the' strike promptly came, and then it em-
ployed less men. The Government didn’t
show its faith in the permanence of its fac-
tory by putting up houses for the men itself.
Nobody else had much faith in the perma-
nence of the affair, and there is no joy in
building for a population that is liable to
depart at any moment. In other towns the
house famine simply happened.
House-owning is a business by itself. No
decent intelligent man likes to know on his
death-bed that he has left his wife a few
small dwelling-houses as her sole means of
support. No girl who can make a real
success of collecting rents from a row of
small dwellings is the sort of girl that, an
ordinary man wants to marry. The job is
not very pleasant and is precarious. In bad
times such as those of the bank-smash it is
to a great extent a record of empty premises,
absconding tenants. tenants that don't
abscond but are unfinancial. rates payable
on unremunerative properties, and dilapi-
dations. Therefore building societies per-
ished like structures of cards. The extent to
which an indignant tenant can dilapidate is
wonderful. The large profane tenant who
offers to fight for the rent is an element in
the case. The weeping tenant who has a tale
of woe to relate is another. The grocer or
the meat person can simply say that he re-
gards the old bill as a bad debt, but he won’t
supply any more groceries or meat. The
landlord can cut off the supply of house by
a time-wasting and money-wasting process
of law, and the house inhabitant may do all
sorts of wreckage while the ejectment order
is being procured. Wreckage can only be
recovered by slow legal process, and not often
then. It is possible, of course, to put in a
bailiff and seize the goods, except those’goods
which aren’t .seizable. and unless it is a fur-
nished house* in which case the landlord
would be seizing his own goods. But seizure
of goods doesn’t recover possession of the
premises. And if the tenant knows all the
intricacies of-the law—that is to say, if lie
is a professional free dweller —he can very
often prove that the unpleasant and disre-
spected officer has been illegally inserted, and
recover damages. An amateur inserter of
bailiffs is simply looking for loss and trouble.
It is calculated that a young-married couple
of good dress and good address—the woman
half of the couple especially—can live for
years in furnished houses in a city the size of
Melbourne or Sydney and not pay on an
average more than one week’s rent in four.
In a general way the person who owns a row
of humble dwellings is looked upon as a
species of cormorant, because of his power
to throw the tenant (with some difficulty)
into the street —in other words, to stop the
supply of roof just as another man might
stop the supply of hat, which is a kind of
roof, if prompt payment isn’t tendered or the
last hat is still owing. Therefore he often
employs an agent and disclaims all responsi-
bility. House-agents, needless to say. don’t
go to Heaven. In a general way it might be
said, under the old order of things when rents
fixed themselves, that a thoroughly hard-
hearted proprietor with a good business train-
ing and enough capital to go into the work
on a large scale —one with a swift nose, for
defaulters, a thorough knowledge of the law
and early-rising habits —could make big in-
terest out of house-owning and also get a
great deal of hard-hearted enjoyment. But
an emotional philanthropist seldom, except
by the accident of unearned increment, made
more than could be got out of Government
securities.
Unearned increment —the habit the land on
which the house is built has of increasing in
value with the growth of population—is
really where the residential variety of land-
lord comes in. Incidentally there is a grow-
ing tendency on the part of the State to tax
the unearned increment. There is also un-
earned decrement which isn’t taxed. Un-
earned increment only affects the land save
in unusual cases; the house is getting into
the sere and yellow leaf all the time. Un-
earned decrement may affect the land princi-
pally. When the great boom broke one Vic-
torian institution lost about £4,000,000 in
this way, and it was only one. But if it is
a case of the chief or sole local industry
dying out, unearned decrement may eat up
the house as well as the land. That is how
things happened with the towns on the old
Palmer goldfield (Queensland) ; much land
became mullock worth one copper per acre,
and the dwellings were left behind. The
same thing happened with many lost towns
in Victoria. Dalmorton, Silverton and
Boydtown (it didn’t die, but was killed) are
somewhat similar examples in N. S. Wales.
Bourke is half-dead, so is Birdsville (Queens-
land) and Coolgardie (W.A.). Charters
Towers (Queensland) is departing. In these
and very many other instances the landlord
simply dropped his capital, or is dropping it.
with a thud. Then superannuation is a kind of
moth and rust. Solid stone houses don't
wear out; rather they die of superannuation.
New ideas of sanitation, ventilation, con-
struction, lighting, etc., come along, and the
house that was the last word in luxury
becomes a back-number and a relic of the
barbarous past. Then the Law condemns it
if the Law does its duty. It is different with
a ship. When it lias finished being the float-
ing palace of the Brisbane-Sydne.v-Melbourne-
Adelaide run it can drift into a humbler
trade among the small tropical ports; then
it can drudge among the Islands, and take to
plain cargo trade, and descend to coal, and
end its century earning a crust as a hulk,
and finally sink and collect a trifle of insur-
ance money on its ghost. But houses aren’t
so versatile.
* * * *
The capitalist (of which class the land-
lord, and especially the landlord of mean
streets, has always been quoted as a speci-
men) still goes around like a roaring lion
seeking great profits to devour. According
to current I.WAV. literature he never roared
so much _ since time began. He would
gladly build houses in multitudes if there
was big money in the business, but appar-
ently there isn’t. It used to pay a good
deal better than investments in Government
securities—so much better as to more than
counterbalance the variety of chances in-
volved. An insane rush of borrowing forced
up the interest on Government securities,
which made landlordism not so good by
comparison. Increased wages and costs,
partly the result of the loan boom. made,
building more expensive, and financial cor-
morants hesitated to put up a £lO.OOO build-
ing which would have been a £7OOO building
before Abe great loan madness and might
be a £5OOO building the day after the loans
ceased to float. Then Fair Rents legislation
began to cut rents down and there arose a
fear that a lot more legislation might follow.
So far as things have gone (and they-are
still going strong) it is possible to get
nearly (i per cent, by investing in the public
debt, which means a big sure return with-
out local l’ates to pay or repairs or drainage
or bad debts. That seems to be practically
the finish. The loan madness ended in the
man who had money to invest in houses be-
ing offered an easier job as public creditor
with better pay. so lie took it just as any
preacher or clerk or amalgamated ship-
bottom-maker might take better pay if it
was thrust upon him.
Exactly who should build houses is a moot
point. Even when rents were as much as
anybody could get and taxes were lower, the
trades unions to all appearance would rather
have been poisoned than invest their funds
in dwellings even for their own members,
though they have always stated that there
was great profit to be made as well as a
large field for reform. They seem tp.be
still in that frame of mind. Life assurance
offices and banks dare not go in for the pre-
carious (business, lest they should scare
their clients. Assurance offices certainly did
and still do a mortgage business; that is to
say they seek for a conservative estimate of
the value of the property and then they lend
nr good interest up to say £6O for every
£lOO. Even then losses have been heavy.
A life office that puts an unusually large
proportion of its funds into mortgages is
viewed with suspicion. Banks have gone
out of landlordism as much as possible. The
work of selling the houses and lands that
were left; on their hands in 1893 is just
about finished now, after 23 years of toft
and loss, and that is a solemn lesson. Build-
ing societies specialise in helping the con-
struction of houses not in taking the entire
risk—and their earnings are not dazzling.
Trustee companies avoid landlordism most
rigidly except as regards their own office
properties. Private trustees, unless in the
almost impossible case of direct instruction,
don’t buy or build terraces or cottages for
their clients with their' clients’ money lest
they should be put in gaol for .a breach of
some Act or other. There is a frequent
theory that municipal councils should build
bouses with borrowed money, but borrowed
money is very, very high, and Fair Rents
arc not very high, and three aldermen would
be disliked —the one who couldn’t make the
venture pay, the one who put out the tenant
who didn’t pay, and the one who increased
the rates because the affair didn’t pay. It
is also urged that the State should build
cheap houses with high wages (especially
high in the case of the State, because it has
become a tradition that voters have to be
propitiated) and costly materials and enor-
mously expensive loan money. In fact every-
body holds that someone else should build a
house.
Meanwhile the time comes nearer when
this bright, free young nation will sleep out,
with its clothes and furniture and groceries
around it and its money in a bag hanging
from a tree.
THE SOCIETY FOR THE PREVEN-
TION OF PROMOTION.
“By the term working class I mean those people
who work with their hands for wages. The term
therefore does not include all workers by any means
but only that largest section of the workers called
the manual proletariat whom the conditions of their
employment force into a potentiality of common feel-
ing and thought, and a common indignation, a
source of common needs and a source of power in
common action. Other workers.have not this poten-
tiality of class-consciousness. .. .The farmers imagine
themselves individual units. . . .The clerks all imagine
themselves on the road to be head clerks or even
managers, so cannot league together in comradeship.
The professional worker is dominated by pride in his
individual ability and training. .. .The working-class
then... .means those who are hired in herds mostly
by companies, and mostly to work at machines of
one kind and another. .. .They must resist the pres-
sure of the employing class.” —Letter by an appar-
ently genuine working-man in S. M. Herald.
It is an interesting statement of the case
and a text on which to hang a discourse: —
The manual worker is often hired by companies,
though probably not of.tener than the clerk. Banking,
fire and life insurance,' building society, trustee and
investment and some other varieties of clerks all
work for companies. It doesn’t seem to be any
harder to work for a company than a private
employer. Only the chronic grievance-monger speaks
of working for a company as if it was equivalent to
toiling gratis for a leper.
The manual worker starts, as a rule, with the
same equipment as a clerk or a fanner (not with the
same equipment as a solicitor or a doctor, for these
have to spend much money in buying more mental
equipment and devote unprofitable years to acquiring
it while the manual toiler is earning money). That
is to say, he has a good State-school education. He
begins his working career by learning how to employ
a machine. So does the clerk, though his machine
is a book of the simpler kind in which he enters
figures as any automaton might do, or an implement
on which he copies documents by tapping
keys. If he lacks energy or brains or ambition he
remains a human machine all his days, and is a.
.cheap clerk when he dies.
The manual worker starts, as a rule, with bigger
wages than the teacher, the clerk or the farm-hand
who hopes to farm himself some day.
The manual worker’s prospects are that he may
become a foreman, a manager, a shareholder in a
co-operative enterprise, or may start as an employer
on his own account. In this respect he is better
off than many clerks, for the banking or insurance
employee has no chance to become a bank or an
A.M.F. Society on his own. On the other hand, the
clerk has an advantage. He may grow into an
employer without losing caste or becoming a public
enemy in his own estimation. He hasn't been
brought up to the gospel that the employer is an
unattainable example, to be envied or denounced
afar off.
The manual worker is taught (he is always allow-
ing himself to he taught by somebody) that he
should keep in the narrowest kind of a groove. There
is more difference between the contractor’s clerk and
the fire-insurance clerk or between the hank clerk
and the solicitor’s clerk than between the carpenter
and the slater. Yet the unionist clerk may shift,
round at a moment’s notice front one branch to
another when he sees profit in it, or he may learn and
practise two branches at once without being a glaring
evildoer. If a carpenter is found enlarging his
knowledge and his possibilities by fixing on slates as
a side-line, the slaters' union puts him back in his
proper place. He shows dangerous signs of ambition
or versatility.
The manual worker is taught or ordered by the
implement he has created not to earn more than his
fellows—at least, not so much more as to be con-
spicuous. Piecework, even when a fixed minimum
wage is included so that the inferior worker may
earn as much as he does now while the superior one
may earn a lot more, is generally regarded as
anathema. It might lead to some men developing
into a labor aristocracy, being promoted through
having a chance to display extra ability, or accumu-
lating enough to start for themselves. The tendehpy
is to flatten everybody down as far as possible to the
level of the “herd” about which so much complaint
is made. The “herd” has to be preserved. No head
must appear above the rest except the head of the
person who discourses on the wrongs of the “herd”
from which escape is, so far as possible, prohibited.
There must be no uplifting—except of the person who
discourses and hopes to get into Parliament later on
—unless the whole “herd” is lifted, and some of it
is very hard to lift.
The invariable complaint made by or on behalf of
the manual worker when piece-work is proposed, even
with a minimum equal to the present average rate,
is that the cloven hoof and serpent head of “speed-
ing up’’ is visible behind the scheme. Speeding-up
which, under the circumstances mentioned, consists
in the worker doing more work and gaining by it,
is understood to. he so obviously accursed that it
only needs to be mentioned for the leprosy to be
self-evident. It is a sin that speaks for itself as
heresy or witchcraft used to do, and as treason did
until it became rather a virtue to be pro-Hun and
to be forbearing towards William llohenzollehn,
the great capitalist and slave-driver. Speeding-up
tends to discrimination, to the separation of the
useful from the less useful, to the emergence of
individuals —in short to the disruption of the “herd”
by some of it getting ahead and breaking away
from the carefully preserved grievance.
The general instruction given to the manual
worker (there are so many people who strike the
attitude of a schoolmaster instructing an infant
class and expound thihgs to the worker!) is that
if things are “speeded up” there won’t be enough
work to go round. At present there is far too much
work to go round. The congestion of unperformed
Work is so dreadful that the country spent as much
as £76,000,000 last year in paying outside unionists,
non-unionists, white labor, colored labor, “scabs,”,
capitalists, companies, syndicates, monopolists, etc.,
to do work for us, and borrowed many millions
from usurers, etc., to pay these “scabs,” etfc.
Furthermore, the manual worker has preached to
him (such a lot of people preach to him, and how
patiently he listens!) about the splendid doctrine
of 00-operation. But not one of his leaders comes
forward with a complete plan for starting Labor’s
own coal-mines, or banks, or insurance offices, or
building societies, or factories. There is money in
abundance on which to base the attempt, but it
would require organisers, leaders and constructors,
and if they arose it would spoil the beautifully
flattened, surface of the “herd.” And to ensure
success the new men would have to be obeyed, which
is contrary to the law that an ox-like obedience must
be given to the men who order the “herd” to go
slow. Also it would spoil some of the handy oratory
about the employer, for Labor being its own employer
couldn’t well denounce itself. Furthermore it would
he getting out of the rut, arid the rut is very, vety
deep.
* » * ♦
The problem seems to move around in a
circle. Perhaps a beginning might be made
by the abandonment of the herd idea. No
other set of men call themselves a name like
that. Labor has already proved in politics
that equality is only workable on a limited
scale. A Certain amount of it can be
attained, but still even when the party is in
power it has been found that only one man
can be Premier at £l5OO a year, and that
the whole crowd can’t be Agent-General
simultaneously. It might be well to admit
the fact in other directions. As matters
stand an artisan can’t work outside the
union : that is verboten. Inside it he must
“go slow” a good part of the time, either
through pressure of opinion or by direct
orders from the All-Highest; going ,fast at
these times is verboten. Often there is a
strike, and going of any kind is verboten.
There is little scope for ambition, for amid
the general slow-going individual ability has
small chance to show itself. There is no
chance to develop a talent for organisation
except by organising strikes, grievances and
politics, for the co-operative industries that
might be organised don't exist and appar-
ently aren’t wanted. There is no chance
worth mentioning of becoming an employer.
Wages are good in proportion to the amount
of work that is «?«ne, and in proportion to
the amount and kind of work there is to do
when £76.000.000 a year of jobs, including
most of the higher-class jobs, are left to the
foreigner per medium of his agent the im-
porter, yet these wages don’t allow of any
solid accumulation of capital. So the
business of being an employer—which the
manual worker is assured is an exceedingly
pleasant occupation—is mostly left to a
separate class which is disliked for being
separate. And if the ambitious artisan
takes the road that is onen to him, that of
politics, he has to stick to the text that
the worker, though lie represents the majority
of the community, and has his full share of
voting power, and has made six Federal
Ministries, and a lot of State Ministries,
has splendid intelligence, and is more down-
trodden than ever. For if he said that the
whole system was a muddle, he would be
back among the “herd” very suddenly. So
Labor, which starts life with an expensive
State-school education, and with better pay
than the average kid of its age, and with
the biggest share of the control of a conti-
nent in its hands, except when it wrecks
its own Cabinet, says that it is an oppressed
institution, and sometimes even calls itself
a “herd.”
AN APPEARANCE FOR THE
DEFENDANT.
Prime-Mi n ister-for-the-ti me-beino Watt
has given way to the clamor of Bitnstruggle
the parson, anti Plate the deacon, conse-
quently the idea of some kind of lottery to
aid the public funds and cheer up the popu-
lace is tabooed. The glad assurance was
given to the public by flit' serious Scotch
mouth of Professor MactNtyre, Moderator-
General of the Presbyterian Kirk of Aus-
tralia, and he evidently regarded it as
good tidings. Now. a State lottery
doesn’t lead to bigotry, persecution,
cant, hypocrisy. narrow-mindedness. in-
tolerance, sacerdotal arrogance, self-suffi-
ciency. priggishness, rabid sectarianism,
hatred, uncharitableness or malice. It makes
no man either dogmatic or pupmatlc or
pragmatic. It doesn’t cause him to be an
habitual dodger of the truth through a life-
time spent in sliding out of impossible theo-
logical positions. No lottery is likely to
cause anybody t<L yearn for the high place
at the feast or the front seat in the syna-
gogue. It is impossible to trace in it a basis
of- immorality, evil-speaking, evil thinking,
religious mania, ill-health or the hollow
pretence of spiritual superiority. The win-
ning of a big prize may lead some weak-
minded people to drink or unseemly riot,
but that sort of thing can't be helped so
.long as there are any prizes in life —promo-
tion to a higher billet or a better kirk, sud-
den rise of salary, inheritance, unearned in-
crement of the corner allotment, the appear-
ance of rich gold in the reef, marriage to a
wealthy wife, a wonderful invention such


as a gun or a sewing-machine, or the dis-
covery of a new chemical compound worth
£5 per ounce. A State lottery doesn’t create
a useless, costly parasitic class like racing.
It doesn’t lead to long sittings in a foul
atmosphere. as cards may do. It
causes no waste of time. Some forms
of gambling may tend to dishonesty;
when the cards go wrong there is a breath-
less, illogical tendency to double the stakes
and double them again; and when two horses
lose in succession some folk become wild and
go a. “mucker” on horse No. 3, and having
failed again stake their whole worldly pro-
spects and their shirt on No. 4. But the
lottery is a quiet, slow-going affair, which
leaves plenty of time for reflection between
acts. Nobody can accuse it of being a
wasteful luxury. The State gets something
to help it avoid the shameful fraud and
cowardly sin of pawning posterity to the
money-lender so that this generation may
live at ease and say “dash the children” —a
sin, by the way, against which the Church
isn't very articulate, though it is one which
eats away the soul of a nation faster than
false doctrine. The rest of the money goes
honestly back to the investors, less a very
modest amount—less than the price of a
stained-glass window for the tabernacle of
an upstart false prophet. If there
is any straight-out prohibition of lot-
teries in the Scripture—anything that
speaks for itself and doesn’t require a
whole priesthood to drag out its hidden mean-
ing—it isn’t well known. The characteris-
tic of the much-abused national gamble is
that it creates a warm feeling under the
waistcoat, or the corset, as the case may be—
a sensation of hope that the ticket may win,
which is akin to the hope that the reef won’t
prove barren, or that the drought may break
in time, or that the rich uncle may die, or
that the promise of Heaven may not be illu-
sive. And if a solid assurance was forth-
coming that there was no Heaven —only per-
dition, and that the reef and every other reef
would be lost labor, and that the drought was
permanent, and that every ticket was a blank,
and that the rich uncle would live for
another 500 years, anil that nothing would
ever turn up, but that everything would turn
down, then it would he a bleak thing to be
alive —as bleak as the color of a Moderator’s
coat-tail.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Nebulosities of an Expense
Minister.
Defence Minister Pearce, with the honors
of blistering criticism from numerous Royal
Commissions and followers of the I’hewsion
thick upon him, put it this way • the other
day to Sydney Millions Club: —
It is quite easy to be a critic. Critics could have
won the war in its first year, but unfortunately it
could not be won by criticism. (Laughter.) Some of
the criticism was helpful, some of it ill-informed,
querulous and harmful. In four years he had endured
as much of it as any other man in Australia. P>ut
it had not worried him, because he • felt he was
doing his best under very difficult circumstances.
And he had lived to see spine of the criticism of
the early stages of the war absolutely destroyed by
the experiences of later events, such, for instance,
as the adjuration that Australia should say definitely
that she would 'send only 100,000 men.
This is very characteristic. As ;i matter of
cold ftict it is not easy to be a critic even
of Pearce. The War Precautions Act makes
criticism an exceedingly difficult business,
as Pearce well knows. Further, it may
be true that the war cannot be won by
criticism, though the remark seems so banal
as to be hardly worth making; but what is
unquestionably certain is that without criti-
cism of the manner in which the war was
being conducted the conflict would have
been over long ago and the Allies well licked.
The trouble with Pearce is that, suddenly
pushed into a place of great responsibility,
he was too little a man for the job and
persisted in trying to hide his abbre-
viation behind an assumption of infal-
libility. He treated suggestive, helpful
criticism as if it were mere fault-
finding. So in course of time the aggre-
gation of muddle grew so calamitous that
there was nothing much more for the scan-
dalised looker-on to do than to throw clods
and curses. But it.is not the criticism that
is ill-informed, querulous or harmful which
Pearce stands at the bar for judgment on.
The reports furnish,ed by Royal Commis-
sions in relation to the Defence Department
stand on permanent record to weigh against
any yarn Pearce may put up at a Millions.
Club guzzle or anywhere else about the
critic. Unless Pearce is prepared to charge
the various Commissioners, whose recom-
mendations he has tardily assented to, with
being ill-informed and incompetent the less
he talks kbout the subject the better. In
any case his own recent wail about the sys-
tem he was working under seemed to clinch
the whole business.

The lied Tape Craze.
The Federal Income Tax Department is
accused of being a much more costly outfit
than similar institutions maintained by the
States. One possible explanation of this
may be that the Federal Department is
accumulating experience as well as revenue.
Anyway some recent demands it launched on
taxpayers appear to afford quite a lot of
evidence that the Department has red tape
on the brain. In order to arrive at the tax-
able income derived from property the
owners thereof are allowed deduction for
expenditure on repairs and maintenance.
This has gone on since 1014. Now the
Department is calling for particulars of
every item of expenditure on which claims
had been allowed in previous years. Thus
in the case of an individual who had been
allowed exemption in the T 4 and succeed-
ing assessments of. say, £lOO each year, the
Department now requires him to furnish an
itemised list for every shilling spent in those
years. In many cases it must inevitably
be impossible to-dp this. In other cases the
cost of getting the'work done will be greater
than the allowance of taxation gained by
the deduction. Taken generally it is most
likely that the cost to the Department of
wading through and checking the vast
masses of figures will be a long way greater
than tfye income to be achieved. The Bul-
letin puts it to Treasurer Watt that
this sort of thing is indefensible, and
that it would be just as well if he persuaded
the Department to make up its mind at
once about what it wants instead of several
years later. That the Department should
require details of expenditure on wages and
material for any exemption under these
headings is understandable. But it ought
to say S 4) —make clear the obligation to sup-
ply such details —before the exemptions are
granted instead of sanctioning exemptions
and then getting busy with what looks like
a trick. llow many people who own houses
can remember what they spent on paint and
new taps and little tinpot repairing jobs
after four years’ interval? The mere fact
that they are being asked to do so should
give Watt a sound reason for asking how
much time officialdom has spent in sleep—
why these belated demands were not made
before —and why the Department is not
more explicit and business-like over its job?
There are some quaint features about the
exemptions allowed by the Department. For
instance, if white-ant devours the floor of
a room and the owner puts in a new floor,
the proceedings become incidental to main-
tenance and no exemption is permitted.
But if the ants were interrupted before
digesting the last beam and the sound wood
is incorporated with floor No. 2, then the
affair is regarded as a repair, and a claim
for allowance on the expenditure passes.
Further, if a sanitary cistern becomes de-
crepit it can be patched and re-patched
without taxation. But if the proprietor
drags it out and puts in a new one then he
must either pay or rush to the High Court.
Ali this seems rather weird, not to say silly,
Also it seems to account in some measure
for the high cost of collecting Federal
revenue.
Failures of the Fourth Mailed Fist.
Saving the face of- the royal family is a
costly business for the nation. When Aus-
tria clumped heavily and stupidly into its
war with Prussia in 1866 it was realised at
the last moment that the blue-coat’s breech-
loading rifle fired three times as fast as the
white-coat’s muzzle-loader, and that the cam-
paign was practically all over before it
started. Austria had one really good general,
the Archduke Albert (by some mistake the
loony, decadent Hapsburgs grew a pair of
brilliant soldiers in one century), and he
might by chance have pulled the situation
out of the fire. But considering the old
muzzle-loader, it hardly seemed worth risking
the imperial prestige on the chance, for there
was so little imperial prestige to spare. So
the capable Archduke was sent to gather
assured laurels in the Italian campaign and
gild the crown afresh, while Benedek. a
good enough man but not by any means a
breech-loader, was selected to meet the big
enemy. He failed, though not so very badly,
and a peace was patched up. else the Arch-
duke would have had to risk his fine reputa-
tion against Moltke with the superannuated
gun in his hands (to do him justice, he
badly wanted to try it), and if he had failed
people were just about ready to tell the
Hapsburgs that they were superfluous and
no use. The Prussian gang is now in
an even worse difficulty. The Crown Prince
is to bo emperor in course of time. It is a
tradition that every Hohekzollern is a
great fighter, though only two of the breed
have been specially notable in that way.
William, the first Kaiser, was brave but
ordinary. Frederick, the second one, was
reputedly brave but ordinary. William, the
third and present Mailed Fist, has shunned
the cannon's mouth as if it were a serpent.
Heir-apparent William, who is to be. the
fourth Mailed Fist, simply must do some-
thing to save the family face. But there is
such a large acreage of face to save, and the
Incipient Mailed Fist doesn’ttseem equal to
the work. Twice it has been stage-managed
that that young man with the hen-resembling
countenance was to capture Paris as his
grandfather and great-grandad did. and thus
consolidate the dynasty, which is rather new.
and whoop up the great alleged traditions of
the race. The failures have been large and
dismal. There is more joy in knocking out
William, the Fourth Mailed Fist that is to
be, than in defeating six ordinary generals.
For it is a plain intimation to the Hun
people that something is wrong with the
firm of Me und Gott. In fact, it suggests
that Gott has singled out Me for special
contempt and reprobation ; and this makes it
easier to stipulate in the terms of peace that
the Hoiienzollerns shall lay aside their
crown, all their titles and their estates, and
dwell in a back street.

How the Hun Plays the Game.
“0.K." : As a warmer-up of British feeling
against the Huns W. M. Hughes, from
Australia, doesn’t appeal to me like his
namesake W. H. Hughes, of the R.N. Staff-
Paymaster Hughes told a tale on a London
platform last week which will be cited when
a thousand incidents of Hunnish foul dealing
have gone into the melting-pot of remem-
brance. In this story of the sea the princi-
pal Fritz Tar appears as a perfect devil of
ingratitude, whilst his subordinates count as
silent partners in his cold-blooded fiendish-
ness. A British patrol-boat in the Atlantic
came across a derelict U-boat which had
gone wrong in its internals and could no
longer sink into hiding. So the Britisher
took the Hun crew aboard, before destroying
the submarine. The commander of the patrol-
boat wanted an assurance that all the enemy
seamen were rescued, and the Hun com-
mander called the roll of his crew, who
answered to their names. There came a
sound from the interior of the now crewless
submarine, but the free and breezy German
officer had nothing to say about it. Asked

of the derelict the haughty mariner pro-
fessed to be ignorant of the cause.
Four years ago the word of a Hun
naval-officer would have been accepted
for a lot more than it was worth,
but under present circs, the British captain
decided to suspect his gallant prisoner of
being a liar. Proceeding to search the derelict
prior to blowing it up, he found four Brit-
ish seamen tied up in one of the compart-
ments. The tapping had come from these
hidden men. The rescued Huns had hoped
to be presently chuckling over the destruc-
tion of the four seamen by a British bomb,
though they would doubtless have preferred
to have left them to a lingering deatli in
the depths of their deserted prison. The
average Stop-the-War dullard, who persuades
himself that Germans are not “bad sorts,”
should read this story twice.
A Misguided Party Named Abdul.
The fact seems to be that the Turk is taking
stock. He went into the war in the hope
of recovering direct control of Egypt, and
in doing so he lost the tribute of about
£BOO,OOO a year which the country paid, and
he didn't get Egypt, and the Hun shows
signs of wanting it himself for the sake of
the Suez Canal. If lie doesn’t get Egypt
he can’t recover Tripoli, which lies beyond.
He expected that his share of the loot would
include all or most of his lost provinces to
east and north of the Black Sea, including
the old tributary Mohammedan kingdom of
the Crimea and the magnificent oil deposits
of Baku —a trifle of 250,000 square miles
at least. When Russia collapsed the Hun
was in a position to deliver part of the
goods, but it transpired that the Hun idea
ivas to establish a lot of petty German-
ruled States which would be part of the
Federated German Empire. Then Abdul-
Muixock looked confidently towards recov-
ering the Dobrudja as a sort of outlying
possession, but Bulgaria also wanted the
place with the difficult name, and Bulgaria
got it. Annexations in Persia were barred
because the Hun wants that road to India
for himself: besides, the Persian objected,
and it ivasn’t a time to look for new foes.
Salonika can't be recovered, for that great
seaport is the thing that Austria has been
looking for any time during the last cen-
tury. In fact, the Turk learned that his
reward is to be simply a Hun guarantee of
the integrity of the dominions which be is
steadily losing—the same sort that Belgium
bad. Also the Hun proceeded to borrow
his fleet. Britain and France offered the
same guarantee at the beginning of the
war, not as the price of the Turk's assist-
ance. but in return for his neutrality, and
the Anglo-French guarantee is pretty good
while the Hun guarantee is darned bad.
The Unspeakable was to lie back and make
money by selling goods to the* Allies, and if
Bulgaria attacked him single-handed, which
would lie a poor business for Bulgaria, he
would have a free hand to spank that
ancient enemy. He put his piastre on the
wrong mule, and his prospective losses are
the Egyptian tribute, his protectorate over
Arabia, his provinces of Syria and Mesopo-
tamia. the Caliphate, the bill for war ex-
penses. the indemnity, and anything more
that may happen. Among the Four Huns
the position apart from lost colonies is this:
Germany holds Belgium and bits of France
and Russia ; Austria holds Servia and bits
of Russia, Roumania and Italy; Bulgaria
has the rest of Servia, and a bit of Rou-
mania ; Turkey has a black eye. a contused
ear, a large hole in the pocket, and a sink-
ing of the stomach.
From the Court table: —
Whether there is justification for the opinion of
X. S. Wales Law Institute that the increase of
divorces granted for non-compliance with orders for
restitution of conjugal rights is “a public scandal”
depends upon the further allegation that this is ‘‘a
menace to the well-being of the social life of the
State.” Obviously if it is not a menace to sever the
bonds because one of the parties declines to cohabit
with the other and wants to go and cohabit with
someone else in a perfectly respectable way, the
scandal evades detection. The argument against
severance under these circumstances has only to be
carried beyond the preliminary stage to evolve into a
contention that the State must insist upon Sin
before his Honor can pronounce a decree nisi. Thus
the Divorce Court would be an institution for incite-
ment to what is called immorality. It would accom-
plish its purpose in two ways—first by declining to
annul the marriage of a pair who had become hate-
ful to each other and compelling them to continue
a relationship that must be grossly immoral;
secondly, by offering escape from immorality only by
an avenue which the Law regards as the last word in
moral wickedness. Which is the greater menace to
Society—for the Law to drive a man or woman into
adultery as the only alternative to escape from a
miserable life, or for the Law to permit escape with-
out a proclamation of moral baseness and minus the
stain of impropriety ? The trouble is that the
question is not so easily answered as the average man
supposes, mainly for the reason that in practice the
restitution of conjugal-rights business is just a gag
that affronts the very foundation of Divorce Law. No
one who is familiar with proceedings in the severed
bonds jurisdiction has even a shadow of doubt that
in a large percentage of cases there is collusion —that
175 coaches, tip-drays, bullock-waggons, motor-cars
and locomotives are driven abreast through the Law,
which, if approached from another angle, regards
collusion as an absolute barrier to a decree. Resti-
tution as a cause of divorce is really a fraud on the
Law. Of that no reasonable suspicion is' held by
Parliament, the Bar or Bench. In Maoriland the Diyorce
Law, as amended about 10 years ago, eliminated the
conjugal-rights decree from the procedure, the con-
siderations being principally those which agitate the
N. S. Wales Law Institute. But does this step
amount to anything more than an evasion of the real
question, which is whether there is not something
horribly immoral about legal processes Which compel
people unhappily married to either choose between
conspiracy or becoming adulterous, or to remain
enmeshed in a contract outrageously abominable to
one, or perhaps to both? In the eyes of the State
marriage is a civil contract. When the two parties
are prepared to have it cancelled, the way should
be open to them to do the deed decently.
The “Tame Prophet” orates: —
My opinion is that the Emperor Carl of Austria
will be mysteriously drowned like Ludwio of
Bavaria. Ludwig was an erratic genius, but he had
good points—he was splendidly handsome, he was
kindly to the poor and a dreadful fool in money
matters generally. He loved art, he didn’t drink, he
didn’t run after women, he had no desire for war,
and he hated his Prussian relations with a great
hatred. He wanted to keep out of the war with
France in 1870, but Bismarck’s forged telegram
persuaded him that France was the aggressor and he
drifted in. The big Hun in Berlin promptly
snatched command of the Bavarian army, and Lud-
wig became a cipher. He refused to be a party to
the new German Empire unless the crown was made
elective, as in the early days of the previous empire.
His country in his opinion was as important as
Prussia had been before Bismarck started it on its
career of thieving, and he considered that his family
or any other family had as good a right to nominate
a candidate as the Hohenzollerxs. His plenipoten-
tiaries were bought over by Bismarck and co. —in
fact almost everybody round the suspected and unsus-
pecting monarch was bought over in course of time,
including his valet and his cook and his private
secretary, and they signed the bond which made the
Bill push hereditary kaisers. By-and-bye the lonely
and embittered king tried to break loose, and his
letters revealed that he had attempted to make a
separate agreement with France. As Bismarck had
the complete run of the deluded man’s correspondence
and had bought the Bavarian post and telegraph
department body and soul, things were always re-
vealed. It was recognised that a crisis had arisen,
and the king who had tried to rival the Bill family
w r as found drowned. His doctor, who w r as, of
course, in Prussian pay, was also drowned. It is
supposed that a further crisis had arisen and that
the King committed suicide, taking his medical
attendant into the wafer with him and sitting on
his head in both their last moments. If he did, it
w'as one of the few wise acts in his erratic career.
Carl of Austria shows signs of a desire to break
away from the Prussian alliance, and if I were Carl
I would keep aw'ay from deep water as carefully as
if I had hydrophobia. In a sense, too, Ludwig of
Bavaria recalls the futile Czar, with his German wife
and his entourage of German sympathisers, who was
so carefully shepherded at his country house that the
revolution had, been blooming in Petrograd for 48
hours before he was really aware of the fact.
• : ♦
Probably the Bolsheviks will realise yet
that the obliteration of Nicholas 11. and his
son. if the latter is obliterated, was a mis-
take. The French began to have doubts in
the case of Louis XAT. They had possession
of tliq Lord’s Anointed and the prospective
Anointed: in other*words, they held the
leader of the Opposition. To all intents and
purposes they were the Opposition as well
as the Government. The Anointed, so long
as he was well treated and well fed, would
issue almost any orders that the Government
pleased. His son might have been reared as
a good republican, so that if by ill-luck he
became a king in the end he would be quite
an unusual kind of king with quite an
unusual crowd of friends. The emigrant
nobles might have been kept out of the coun-
try for ever and a day, so that they shouldn't,
have a chance to corrupt the mind of the
h <ir. and go that, if he did recover the
throne and they came back, they would be
complete strangers to him. When the
deposed king and his son passed out there
arose automatically a new Anointed who was
outside the Republic’s jurisdiction, and who
was worse than the old one. Nicholas 11.,
in the same way, was a flabby failure. His
extinction hands over his claims and his
prospects to a younger man with a better
military record who lias the great advantage
of being at large. The one virtue of heredi-
tary despotism is that when the despot is
captured he is a valuable hostage, and the
loss of him to some extent hamstrings his
party. Of course, if he is not killed he may
escape, but then if he is killed he does escape
-that, is tn say. the king escapes though the
man doesn’t.
The Fourth of August.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Four years ago this day to maddened power
We flung the gage of battle. Fear on fear
Filled with loud death each red destroying
hour.
Vast comrade agonies o’er ruin sheer
Moved us from that long peace we held so
dear.
A thousand voices clamored to.our pride
To share their pain lest holy freedom died.
Leaving a wailing memory on our ear.
It was the blind dark of the ages gone,
Lit with the lightnings of man’s newest hell
That surged against the world. No clear star
shone,
No voice of hope cried like a silver bell
Amid the gloom of death that all was well.
We feared, we faced the horror of the day :
And in the awful strife that barred the way
To greater horror our proud legions fell.
So few they were in that wild storm where
rage
Had edged all hate with steel. Thermopylae
It seemed was fought again—a splendid page
Written in noblest blood for men to see
Through the long darkness of the years to be.
Should the fear triumph? Strong our man-
hood rose.
Swiftly our armies mustered. On our foes
The new high valor thundered as a sea.
Proud France, proud Britain —doubly proud
in death —
Grand in advance and grander in retreat—
Filled a world trumpet with their stormy
breath,
Scorning the shadow of their truth’s defeat.
In the far west new drums were heard to
beat,
And over leagues of ocean Freedom's call
Rang to the stern defenders at the wall; —
“We come to make Man’s victory complete !”
Three days Leonidas had held the pass
E'er he and his three hundred fighting fell.
Wetting with Spartan blood the trampled
grass
That had a glory to all years to tell.
Such valor the old earth remembers well:
But who through all the ages shall forget
The wonder of a hundred leagues death-wet
Where Man four years held back the hosts
of Hell?
Four years! And now the grand assurance
grows
Of mightier trumpets pealing victory.
This hour the fear is gripping at our foes.
Earth laughs through all her happy winds
to see
Plataea, from what seemed Thermopylae.
Filling with victor shouts from east to west:
And knows the great red sacrifice was best
That gave Peace room to stand erect and
free.

The excellence of bitro-phosphate in cases}
of sleeplessness and nerve troubles is now
generally admitted by chemists and medical
men. Further proof of its value is found in
the recently-published report of an eminent
specialist, who states that the outstanding
feature of the thousands of cases investigated
was that, in nearly every instance, in addi-
tion to restoration of nei’vous vitality and
mental vigor, the patients reported an in-
crease in physical strength and endurance,
and a great improvement in general health.
In view of the conclusive proof of these
unusual merits, bitro-phosphate is now being
put up in packages of srgr,ain tablets, and
sufferers from nervousness, insomnia, nerve
weakness and lack of strength are strongly
advised to at once obtain a supply of bitro-
phosphate from the chemist and regularly
take one tablet immediately after every meaL

The German Defeat, and To-morrow.
The German shift astern continued all last
week. At time of writing the Marne “pocket”
had been emptied of enemy whose Front ran
practically in a straight line from Rheims
to a little beyond Soissons. This represents
a heavy defeat for Von Hindenberg to ex-
plain. Meanwhile his troops were reported
to be still on the reverse, falling back to
localities they occupied before the first south-
ward advance in May. The tale of German
prisoners taken since Foch hit back is given
at 40,000. Casualties are largely a matter
of speculation. Without a doubt they have
been heavy on both sides, for the fighting
seems at times to have been terrific. As has
been customary since the beginning, there'hits
been a recrudescence of optimistic language
on the side which got the better of the latest
proceedings while the chronicles of the other
party have been afflicted with pessimism.
This is very natural. It happens that in
this case there are many reasons for the Ger-
man to feel unhappy. One of them is that
an American army is pouring into France at
a rate few people, whether German or
otherwise, had ever dreamed about until
lately. Another is that the Kaiser had
confidently assured the Fatherland he has
tortured so long of mighty victories before
Uncle Sam got into his stride. So far the
stupendous preparations made by the Ger-
man to win through to Paris and the sea
during this summer have failed, and the row
he has to hoe is growing harder every
day. But none of us will be outraging
probability if we count on the Ger-
man still being mighty strong and there
being desperate work to do before he is
driven to his natural address. Even this
battle of the Marne shows that in fighting
quality, equipment and tactical efficiency his
armies impose powerful obstacles between the
Allies and final victory. If the fight goes on to
the bitter end it would be as futile to look
forward to termination of the horror either
this summer or next as to look for decisive
victory next week. Whether field hostilities
will go to the final act of bash is another
thing. There is certainly an alternative
possibility, and it is one that the German
people may begin to take seriously before
long.

Australia’s Distant Tin-whistle.
The story of what is happening in London
about “preferential trade” and “development
of the Empire” and “the economic post-war
policy of the Allies” has been reaching Aus-
tralia in a more or less incoherent form.
This may be because nothing coherent has
transpired and nearly everybody concerned
is tootling in vague general terms. British
Ministers appear to be merely sparring for
wind, so to speak—a proceeding which in
the circumstances is not altogether irrational.
Hughes seems to he going the whole hog,
abusing in the most violent terms people
who happen to think differently to himself,
yelling that Britain must at once give the
Dominions a lead, and generally identifying
himself with a particular side in English
politics. The performances of this noisy
person are becoming more and more irritat-
ing. It is clear that he is not speaking
for Australia. By what right—moral,
political or otherwise —does Hughes identify
the Commonwealth with his howls for
fiscal reform in Britain and for “Im-
perial unity” over preference? He has
not a shadow of right, and his con-
duct in pretending that lie has is an abuse of
his position as Prime Minister of Australia
while the guest of the British Government.
If a member of the British Cabinet came to
Australia and publicly blithered hereabouts
after the manner of Hughes over there he
would either be given the tip to go home or
be chased into the interior. The gag about
Australia waiting miserably in the distance
for a declaration of British Customs policy
is grotesque. Britain’s policy is a matter
for the British people to determine. Aus-
tralian policy is for Australians to decide.
There is a vital difference between the
economic position and the necessities of the
two countries. In any case Australians
cannot and will not, unless the population
goes quite mad, listen to projects from
Hughes or anyone else for taking away from
them any part of their absolute authority in
government so far as their own fiscal affairs
are concerned. Tile Canadian Borden has
made the attitude of Canada on this question
plain. It is the attitude of Australia—the
one which Hughes, obsessed by his wild
imaginings about Imperialism, apparently
will not shrink from trying to compromise.
The worst of it is that Australia is not
being heard; that the noise being made,
allegedly for the Commonwealth comes from
a man whom Australians mistrust.
The Hoof of the Daw.
A couple of cases were lately before the
Courts in which it looked as if the Bench
had left its bowels at home. One was of a
woman fined £lO or three months’ imprison-
ment for stealing Sd. worth of biscuits. This
was in Sydney, not Stuttgart. The other
was at Hay, which is in N. S. Wales, not
Hungary, where a woman pleaded guilty to
setting fire to grass. It appeared (1) that
only a small area was burned, (2) that the
accused’s son was suspected, but the mother
had declared herself to be the culprit. Any-
way, she was ordered 12 months in the peni-
tentiary, which appears to this paper an
appalling sentence. Perhaps she was given
the year on account of not having a lawyer,
or because she had what one Judge not long
ago referred to as “a brood of criminals,” or
on account of having an infant in her arms.
Whether the infant is provided with accom-
modation at the penitentiary The Bulletin
does not know, but such information as is
before it suggests that the Minister for Jus-
tice would do no harm if he inspected this
case. This unfortunate woman has a family
of 10 young Australians, ranging from 16
years to as many months. They are a poor,
struggling crowd, and what will become of
them while the mother is undergoing a year’s
imprisonment, the Lord alone knows.

Scare-Headings in the Hun Press.
Our agile Prime Minister, talking in Eng-
land, admits that there is no visible hope of
getting away our accumulated goods to any
serious extent, or preventing a worse accu-
mulation, except by hurrying up with the
construction of our own ships. So the race
has fairly commenced, for instructions have
plainly been issued from Berlin to its agents,
certain men who make a great noise at the
top of industrial affairs, that these ships
must not be hurried. The spectacle of about
400 big shiploads of produce, with possibly
400 more later on, owned by British sub-
jects—produce that the British and their
Allies so badly want—going to waste is so
refreshing that Berlin would gladly pay for
the red flag over Melbourne Trades Hall a
million times over than have it spoiled. It
is like a train-load of iced beer in a thirsty
land. Of course there is no coarse, crude
stoppage of the work. That would be too
obvious, and too much obviousness may lead to
sudden popular fury, and martial law, and
executions by firing-party against a cold wall
on a cold morning. All that is required is
lack of hurry, brought about by natural-look-
ing and accidental-seeming methods. Then
the shipping paralysis may lead to the wheat
industry, for one, closing up for a while.
For if the Government can’t raise money to
make purchases—and its finances, and those
of the banks which carry so much of the
load, are badly strained already-—the article
will be a drug in the market and worth per-
haps one bob per bushel. In this land of
stupendous loans and very few manufac-
tures, and vast expenditure, and compara-
tively little gold and a great deal of paper, a
few more troubles like that might shove us
over the edge into default. Then there would
be glorious material for scare-headings with
which to hearten the Hun: “Britain Gives
Way Under the Strain.” “One Fourth of
the British Empire Files its Schedule.”
“First Time a Continent Has Gone Broke.'*
Of course these scare-headings are in type
already; the attempt made at the Perth
Labor Conference to commit the party —
while so many soldier voters are away—-to
Repudiation, points definitely in that direc-
tion. It wouldn’t be merely a matter of
moral effect. The sudden turning into
waste-paper of the stupendous mass of our
securities held in England wouldn’t make
Bull totter on his basis at ordinary times,
but in these times of stress it would cer-
tainly reduce his punch to some extent. Pre-
sumably the Repudiation would include the
stoppage of the wool and meat and wheat
shipments already contracted for. They have
been paid for in advance, so they form part
of our debt to the Ma Country—debt pay-
able in kind instead of coin. Thus the effect
would be material as well as moral.
' Edwards, of the Labor Opposition in S.A.
Assembly, bombarded the Government with
questions about the knighthood lately given
to Sowden, editor of the Register. He
wanted to know the grounds for it, and on
whose recommendation it was granted; also,
“Is it a fact that, when the Peake Govern-
ment was previously in office, the then
Opposition leader, Crawford Vaughan, was
consulted on the question of such a recom-
mendation. but refused to be a party to it,
for certain well-known reasons?” Peake
parried the first two questions by getting
behind “the veil of secrecy imposed by the
Secretary of State for the Colonies” in such
matters. To the third question he gave a
►plain No —“and I am inclined to think that
the suggestion is an invention.” There would
be some quaint scenes if it became usual for
a Government, before offering an “honor” to
a paper that supported it, to consult the
Oppositionist whom the said paper is every
day abusing. It is only fair to add that
Sowden does a good deal of public work
outside the newspaper office, as president of
various public bodies, notably of the Public
Library and Art Gallery.
“F. Born”: Certain press claqucrs have
been giving Hughes great credit for originat-
ing the cry of a Monroe doctrine for the
Pacific. Hughes did no such thing. General
Smuts, a doer of deeds, in a lecture to the
Royal Geographical Society early this year
pointed out that the young nations who
form the Dominions of the British Empire
“want a new Monroe doctrine for the South,
as there had been a Monroe doctrine for the
West, to protect them against European
militarism. Behind the sheltering wall of
such a doctrine they promise to build up a
new peaceful world, not only for themselves,
but for the many millions of black folk
entrusted to their care.” But Smuts has not
got a publicity outfit working overtime for
him, so you don’t hear much about him.
Major-General Brancker’s recent statement
to the New Yorkers is only moderately
satisfactory:—•
It is certain that the British will be able to bomb
Berlin next Spring. Huge numbers of aeroplanes-are
still required before a great Allied offensive can be
undertaken. Great Britain lacks the capacity of
engine production at present, and therefore she de-
pends on the United States. As the U.S. is unable
to spare Liberty motors, a large proportion of the
British air offensive is delayed seriously.
Why BfiLain should lack capacity of engine-
production for aeroplanes when she is boast-
ing of her productiveness in other war-
munition respects the War Office only knows,
whereas American backwardness is debited to
the awful set-backs due to German traitor-
ism in the factories. Meanwhile the words
of a Dutch merchant are still ringing in the
world’s ears:—
If you want to finish the war quickly, keep on
bombing the Rhine towns. Bomb them to a stand-
still.
Germany can’t afford to lack any capacity
of aviators’ engine production. From the
outset she was the centre of the air war, and
had Russia been urged to develop an aerial
offensive and been assisted by her Allies, the
Iluns would have squealed long before Bol-
shevikism could have turned popular dis-
content to such bad account. Russia,
France, Belgium, Britain, Italy can all
attack Germany from every point of the
compass. To meet combined attacks Ger-
many must spread her defensive forces over
a wide area. An extensive offensive policy at
the same time is not possible to her. So the
utter defeat of militarism by übiquitous
forces of organised bomb-droppers is only a
matter of time, and determination to win the
war by unorthodox means. Militarism every-
where hates the thought of a war being won
by unprecedented means. The fighting aero-
plane is designed by Providence for the final
discomfiture of militarism, and that swank-
ing, gold-laced institution sees the writing
on the wall every time a, bomb falls on an
ammunition dump or troop train.
“Marqui”: The eagle is well represented
among the warring nations. Besides the
Prussian bird there is the white eagle of
Russia, the Austrian eagle and the giant
eagle that belongs to Uncle Sam. Recently
there appeared a great eagle during a bril-
liant and wonderful display of the ’ aurora
borealis in New York, Fort William, On-
tario and Duluth, Minnesota. Both in
New York and in Duluth the Northern
Lights were the most elaborate ever seen so
far south. Though the streamers were vari-
colored, a vivid blood-red predominated.
The Ojibway Indians claimed the apparition
as that of the “Thunder Eagle,” sacred
among them and supposed to have its nest
on the highest peak of the Sleeping Giant,
overlooking Thunder Bay, Lake Ontario.
They said that the fowl had not been seen
for many years and that its appearance
portended startling happenings in the w T orld.
The figure travelled swiftly southward
accompanied by huge, meteoric splashes of
red and green fire. That it was not a cre-
ation of some excited patriotic imagination
was clearly demonstrated, as the morning
papers of Fort William and Duluth of the
same date and of New York, some dis-
tance off. all noted it. Maybe it was pro-
phetic of the bloody but glorious ' part
America is to take in the war.
“Centurion” : “F.G.l.’s” plea for the arm-
ing of everyone with an automatic rifle
sounds well in theory, but has he thought
out a way of keeping the ammunition supply
up to the men? It is not too easy to do
this to fixed positions with good communica-
tions and a well-filled depot handy. On the
move, it is a Sheol of a job chasing up cart-
ridges to the ordinary rifles, let alone the
m.g’s. Even with packhorse transport, the
Light Horse in Sinai and Palestine found
they had to conserve ammunition in every
possible way. Machine-gun belts bulk heavy,
as do the Lewis-gun drums, and even the
flat strips for the Hotchkiss rifle mean great
weight and bulk to keep pace with the rate
at which the gun eats them up. Each of
the Light Horse squadrons were carrying
two Lewis and two Hotchkiss rifles when i
last saw them, and the squadron pack-train
for this lot was a formidable item. What
would it be with, say, 100 Hotchkiss rifles
to feed?
“Richard’s” suggestion :
I have now been for over three months trying to
secure a perfectly simple adjustment of a soldier’s
separation allowance. I am doing this on behalf
of an elderly lady who is quite unable to act for
herself and my unexpurgated opinions of the military
department’s methods are forwarded under separate,
iron, asbestos-lined cover. The lorry will be pre-
ceded by a man with a red flag. I suggest that a
sub-Minis'ter for Defence be appointed for each
State, with a small office at the Barracks. No furni-
ture beyond a square deal table and an upright chair.
There must be no cushions, screens, mirrors or trap-
doors. Luxurious office fixings lead to sloth and
puffiness under the eyes. The under-Ministers could
be chosen from the many unemployed members
of the House of Reps., or the Senate. Having
power to act they should be prepared to dart into
any department and drag out documents, files, offi-
cers, etc. Then a little thing like I’ve been trying
to get fixed up wouldn’t take 15 weeks.
“F.” : It transpires that the collection of pests
in Australia has been added to by the “citrus
canker” arriving in the Northern Territory.
This is a fearsome scourge, for which there
is no known cure except the axe and a con-
flagration. Under ordinary Circumstances
the rabbit, the blowfly, the prickly pear, the
weevil, the tick, the codlin moth, the fruit fly
and the canker would seem to be enough to
go on with and give a fair chance
as an organiser. But N. S. Wales Zoological
Director Le Souef reckons that the time
is ripe for giving the carrion-consuming
vulture a chance. 1 rise wearily to
second the motion with a few additions.
If we could acquire a few million vultures,
start some hyaena kennels, give the tiger,
the puma, the gorilla, the panther, the lion
and the giraffe an opening, and set the
bear and the hippopotamus up in business,
the probabilities are that the blowfly might
be pursued to his lair and devoured, and
the conspiracy to shove up the price of chops
and steak be nipped in the bud.
State Premier Holman (aged 47) had a
birthdav notice and Federal-politician Cook
(aged SS) a notice on his elevation to the
minor peerage on the same day last we.ek.
Holman’s record was something like this,:
Boy orator at 20; labor organiser and im-
passioned public speaker at 21 or there-
abouts; political candidate and burning
Demosthenes at 23; again at 24; fluent
member at 27 and ever since; copious
Attorney-General at 39 ; public cashier with
great rhetoric at 43. Cook’s record: Secre-
tary to a union at 26 or thereabouts; plod-
ding member at 31, and has continued so
ever since; uninspired State . Minister ;it
34; plain ordinary Federal Minister at 49.
The beginning of politics is being organiser
or secretary to a union.
“Quidarn” : In spite of the prevailing high
prices and the heavy expenditure connected
with the Royal Commissions inquiring into
the high price of everything except politics
and Commissions, Australians, so far,
haven’t felt the pinch that has come to so
many other people. One woman, writing
from somewhere, said recently that there
was no white flour obtainable and that the
use of “substitutes” was very disheartening
when, in spite of much care and hard work,
the results turned out almost uneatable. A
little Canadian girl, addressing her grand-
mother in Sydney, stated that white sugar
is so scarce that at a school festivity there
was very little in the cakes and no
sweets. Apparently Australia is about the
only place where one can still eat what he
likes, provided he can pay for it, and no
ships are built to carry the surplus to our
belt-tightened friends. Foreign countries
have already commented on the physique
of the Australians, and if the war
keeps on much longer the disparity between
the next generation of Europe and the popu-
lation of the Commonwealth will be unmis-
takable.


■'Sarto” : The man who committed suicide
in Vic. the other day with a piece of brass
tubing loaded as a gun reminds me of the
impetuous citizen who put his head between
the knives of a hand chaff-cutter, gave the
handle a turn and left his troubles behind
him. It happened quite recently.
Notwithstanding the scarcity of#paper, anti the
natural desire on the part of all publishers to in-
crease the price of their publications, the old estab-
lished Australian Journal is still maintaining its
rate of sixpence per copy. The August number,
which is just published, is as big as the previous
numbers and just as interesting, containing, in addi-
tion to short Stories by well-known Australian authors,
three novels written by Annie S. Swan and Joseph
Hocking. All the other features of the magazine are
well maintained, and certainly at the price of six-
pence the Australian Journal is the cheapest and
best fiction magazine issued in Australia.— Advt.

♦ —.—-
“Business Before Pleasure” brought the
loud laugh to Sydney (Jri. this week. Potash
and Perlmutter are in the film business,
tangled up with jealous wives, promissory
notes, hopes of wealth and dread of bank-
ruptcy, a lady addicted to the Vampire pro-
fession and a vast ignorance of everything
connected with and incidental to the evolu-
tion of flickness. Out of all this is woven a
reasonably coherent story, a comedy with a
plot which manages to keep on its legs
mainly because the two Hebrews hold it up.
But the scheme of the show matters nothing.
It is all Potash and Perlmutter, with
their everlasting squabbles and reconcilia-
tions and queer philosophy; their wrangles
over tlie Vampire and horror at the pay-roll ;
their quaint English, their homely virtues
and their ridiculous humanity. Cut the part-
ners out and there is nothing left. Dump all
the rest overboard and all that is essential
remains, for it is recollection of the two
Yids alone that sticks. Only twice are they
off stage and then only for about HMsec.
They start the laughter by all sorts of de-
vices, some of them frankly banal. Hearing
a Hebrew call the footlights “der feetlight”
is not necessarily wildly comic, and there is
a good deal of that sort of thing ; but not
always. “Der picture pizniss, Abe, is not a
pizniss,” says Mawruss sadly, “it is a dissi-
pation.” There is a good deal of that too ;
and take it on the whole anyone who.refused
to laugh with Potash and Perlmutter might
to take it as a warning against accumulat-
ing bile. “Business Before Pleasure” is
good, clean fun—no more. Waters and
Adams, imported to play the parts of the
Chosen pair, have all the ability required.
They know the job and they do it well.
Maggie Moore, as Rosie Potash, wife of the
much-distracted Abe, gets another notch in
her long score. Rosie Parkes “vampires”
with carmine lips and moderation. The rest
of the cast are not meant to make much im-
pression and they don’t.
* * * *
A feature of “Business Before! Pleasure”
consists of bringing the. film into oneration
for the purpose of maintaining the narrative
of the play. It is possible to conceive a
whole _ series of dramas developing along
these lines, with one scene played in the cus-
tomary way and the next depicted per
camera. Judging by the experiment in this
case, however, the form of such a drama or
comedy has yet to be evolved. In “Business
Before Pleasure” there is supposed to be a
wild rush of several parties by motor to a
country house. This is shown from the film
and the results are nothing to make a
speech over. It is about the only episode
that drags, and the parties projected on the
screen are not the same as started off in
the cars. A different Mawruss and Vampire
are in one vehicle,'and the figure bobbing up
and down on the stern sheets of another
at 75 miles an hour is certainly not the
Potash of'preceding and subsequent acquaint-
ance. A Tew comic remarks projected on
the screen at this stage help to see the break
through. The action of the play resumes
after a scene, that is interestingly tedious
and might as well be shortened by half,
At the Opera House Allan Wilkie is enjoy-
ing life again in “Seven Days’ Leave,” while
his best girl (Marie Ney) is nightly sinking
a German submarine. She does this without
a qualm, while Madame Morel, a German
spy. looks on choking with,, impotent rage or
undigested sauerkraut or something. Sydney
doesn’t seem to tire of the show.
Saturday night brings the end of “The Mas-
querader.” one of the most attractive plays
Sydney lias seen. On Monday Guy Bates
Post starts to say farewell in “The Nigger,”
and the booking indicates that the Palace is
going to fieel sorry that it wasn't born a big
theatre.
A new prancing ballet in which each girl
wears a pair of winkers suits the sporting
surroundings of Act 11. of “Oh. Boy!” at
Her Majesty’s (Sydney). Comedian Alfred
Frith has been given a songandance. but
Connie Ediss still has to get along silently
with two cocktails. Perhaps there is some
difficulty in finding a song suitable for an
elderly Quakeress who has just swallowed
two cocktails.
Sydney James, organiser and director of
many bright shows, has been busy in the
theatrical kitchen, and “Pierrot Pie,” de-
scribed as an extravaganza, will be served
up at The Playhouse (Sydney) for the first
time to-night (Thursday).
“Samples,” now being revived for a limited
season at the Tivoli ( Sydney) is worth see-
ing again, particularly “The Garden of
Eden” ballet, in which Jean Keith is Eve;
the Cretonne Creation, in which dancer Elsie
Parkes stars; the hypnotic farce; and the
dancing Magleys. The Twelve Scotch kids
do the Highland fling and sing their fine
marching song- about the blooming heather
with great spirit, and if Nieman and Ken-
nedy would only trot out their tramp turn
once more with the high-diving announce-
ment the bill would effervesce nicely. Some
new songs have been dropped in (notably
Nellie Leach’s “Roses of Picardy”), and a
new girl, Adrian Ainsworth, attends to some
of the musical jobs formerly done by Marie
Eaton.
Assisted by the Madrigal Society and
accompanied by G. Vern Barnett, Stella
Power sang to an overflow audience in the
Conservatorium (Sydney) just after The
Bulletin had gone to press last week.
Melba’s pet protegee owns a voice of luscious
quality. Round and pure in tone it “pearls”
the trills set before it as easily as a canary
improvises cadenzas after its morning bath,
but, at present, the mechanism, though
moulded on the inimitable Melba pattern is
too evident. Her vocalisation in “Lo ! Hear
the Gentle Lark,” was the youthful soprano’s
triumph. Aided by John Lem monk’s flute
the girl’s facile notes ran up and down tin*
scale with bird-like trills- —and Bishop’s lark
is an agile warbler. Experience and more
study should make this attractive young
songster eminent in lyric music, but, grant-
ing these assets, there is no promise of Aus-
tralia finding a second Melba in Stella Power.
Basso Benham was in the programme.
Too much self-sacrifice is the outstanding
feature of the Strand (Sydney) film, “Her
Decision.” This is the story of an amiable
young woman with a flighty sister, a worthless
lover and a wealthy suitor. No amiable voung
woman could expect more unless she had a
second time on earth. Phillis marries the
wealthy suitor to obtain the wherewithal to
hide her butterfly Sister's singed wings. How-
ever, she manages to find her own happiness
before the final curtain. The Crystal Palace
sets out “The Reason Why,” adapted from
Elinor Glyn’s novel, with Clara Kimball
Young as the chief explanation. The Bul-
letin desires no better explanation. Jane
and Katherine Lee' are the stars in the
Lyceum production, “The Troublemakers,”
These clever youngsters provide lots of fun
“BUSINESS BEFORE PLEASURE,” AT
SYDNEY CRITERION.
Ahe and Mawruss have their usual argument.
and, a happy and exciting ending. At
the Haymarket Douglas Fairbanks is
rescuing another maiden in distress —this
time he is under the disguise of “A Modern
Musketeer”—and Vivian Martin goes quest-
ing for love as “A Fair Barbarian.”
The Waldron-Macdonell season at the Royal
(Adelaide) was a striking succefes, both artis-
tically and popularly. Waldron recalls
Julius Knight at times, but acts with more
ease; he is always delightful to watch. The
lady has the rare gift of sinking her own
identity in the part played; she is a true
worldly woman in “Romance,” and a real
child iu “The Rainbow.” She has some tones-
of Mrs. Brough’s voice of long ago, and her
statue-eome-to-life in “The Willow Tree”
naturally recalled the similar situation in
“Niobe.” A big audience on the final night
broke all local records by refusing to go
away, after a speech from her, until it had
had another from Waldron. Redgrave and
Miss Temple were strong in support all
through, and Eily Malyon and Brampton
increased their reputation by several clever
character-sketches. The Tivoli, in its run of
“KATINKA,” AT HER MAJESTY’S,
MELBOURNE.
Phil Smith and George Welch in a dancing
item.
Andersonian melodramas, has found some-
thing really striking in “Rasputin,” John
Cosgrove having come along specially to play
the alleged monk, to whom the dramatist
does not leave a shred of reputation. A new
comer to the Majestic is Leonard Nelson,
immensely popular as of old. The Walter
Johnson co. shows itself every week in some-
thing fresh which is yet the old thing with
a slight difference. At West’s, the emotional
“Deemster” (which went on to the Pav. for
another run as “continuous”) has made room
for the stirring war-play, “The Belgian” ; and
at Wondergrapli the homely art of George
Behan is for the moment the. brightest thing
in sight.
The Muriel Starr period at the Royal
(Melb.) is nearly ended. On Saturday the
season arrives at its last stage, with a re-
vival of “Bought and Paid For,” wherein
Muriel plays the wife whose bedroom is
burgled by an unsober husband, Frank
Harvey being the intruder who claims pos-
session of the goods. The revival is for a
week only, and then comes Margaret
Wycherly with “The 13th Chair.”
In “Katinka,”" by the way. 13 is the num-
ber of the room allotted to Phil Smith (and
the lady) when he abducts Gladys Monerieff
in the interests of high morality and love’s
young dream. In red-hot irony Philip com-
plains that they “picked a lucky one.”
Touching the managerial choice of “Katinka”
he might say the same thing in all serious-
ness. The opera is now in its ninth week
at Her Majesty’s (Melb.), but its nights
are not yet officially numbered.
“De Luxe Annie,” at Melbourne King’s,
is doing her sixth week, with more to follow.
An air of novelty covers a multitude of
incongruities in melodrama. This one has
the novelty. It keeps you wondering even
when you know the story. For instance,
when Miss Polini says to old Cyrus that
she can see he is a busy man, you wonder
whether Cyrus is really supposed to look
busy, or the designing lady is supposed to he
pulling his rheumaticky leg. His extra-
ordinary upstairs store looks very like a
virgin emporium where the foot of customer
has never trod. Apparently it was readied
up for the sole purpose of entrapping Annie.
A wonderful lot of ingenuity and expense is
lavished on the job of restoring the lady to
her long-lost respectability.
“Time, Please” continues to happen at
the Tivoli (Melb.), and Barry Lupino is
still disturbing the privacy of a little dinner
for two, or expounding the mysteries of poli-
tics to the restful working man.
The Fuller revival of the old-time minstrel
show at the Bijou (Melb.) convinces one
that minstrelsy is a learned profession. Any-
how, none of the co. who during the week
attempted this form of entertainment pos-
sessed the ability to win a diploma in the
business. The eight end-men were mostly
composed of mild young songsters who natu-
rally found a hit of burnt cork destructive of
their identity. Apart from Paul Stanhope,
who turned nigger to perhaps further
blacken the character of the stage Hibernian,
the crowd looked as if it would have been
glad to be somewhere else.
The Chappell concert at the Auditorium
(Melb.) on Saturday was almost engulfed
by the crowd which overflowed on to the
platform. The great attraction, of course,
was Stella Power, who opened with the
familiar “Una Voce,” from “The Barber of
Seville,” and followed it with a choice mor-
sel by Liza Lehmann and Arditi’s waltz-
song, “Se Saran Bose.” Stella’s voice was
particularly suited to the first item, and
revealed glistening surface effects without
quite achieving the peculiar iridescence that
gives the air its popularity. The other num-
bers also shone with a sort of manufactured
excellence which afforded an agreeable sen-
sation to the ear, but never reached the heart
or the head. In Beethoven's “In Questa
Tomba Oscura” Miss Dorothy Murdoch, a
nice mezzo, sang with an effortless accom-
plishment that made every note a surprise.
Henry Lewis, whose whole being is moved
by a tenor voice of seraphic sweetness,
seemed rather uninspiring after another
tenor, Les Pauli, though Pauli’s warble is
operatic in ambition if not in achievement,
and revels in lyrics of a deep Verdian hue.
Miss Margery Grey, violinist, and Miss
Fernie Boyle, pianist, produced tone pearls
from their instruments, whilst Elvins was
the usual unimpeachable.
“Lest We Forget,” filmed at the Town
Hall fMelb.) last Saturday, turned out to
be more melodrama than propaganda, and
only half a programme of both. It hovered
around the war, however, in a pleasingly
anti-llunlike manner, and its riskiest effects
of supernaturalism and picturesque murder
were the most impressive. The orchestral
accompaniment was helpful, and the singing
of Irma Caron was artistic and oppor-
tune. The least realistic feature of tin l
show was the sinking of the (alleged) Lusi-
tania. The same sort of thing was done
with more force and detail in a Mary Pick-
ford drama, which was filmed before America
joined the war and was violently protested
against by local friends of the Kaiser.
** * *
In “Barbary Sheep.” at Hoyt’s Lyceum
(Melb.) this week. Elsie Ferguson is the
taking little titbit who excites a villain’s
fancy. Elsie is the neglected missus who
happens so frequently in the movies and
treads a much-used path to a foregone con-
clusion. At Hoyt’s Bourke-street branch
Douglas Fairbanks and Vivian Martin are
the companion triflers. Fairbanks is the
dinktim Doug, in one of his happiest com-
edies, "A Modern Musketeer.” Vivian is the
mischief in “The Fair Barbarian” who
causes sentimental distress among short-
sighted followers.
“The Sign Invisible,” at the Majestic
(Melb.), shows the soothing effect of soli-
tude on a protracted heart-ache. The hero
is a doctor who is driven to drink by his
disappointments, but rallies marvellously
when he encounters the right scenery anil
realises the virtues of friendship and water.
“The Marionettes,” with Clara Kimball
Young in the limelit spaces, is a tip to young
wives who want their hubby’s wandering
attentions to turn homeward again. The
setting and dresses in this ostentatious film
would make a substantial bank account an
empty void.

During the past half-year the purchase of
the City Bank of Sydney lias been completed
and its assets absorbed. The City’s capital
consisted of 50,000 £lO shares paid to £8
(-£400,000). For each of these shares the
A.B.C. paid £7 ss. and the whole of this pur-
chase money of £302,500 has been paid. The
absorption of the City’ Bank and the half-
year’s operations have brought about these
changes in the A.B.C.’s figures :—•
Dee., 1917. June, 1918.
Paid capital. . ..£1,198,579 £1,198,079
Inscribed deposits. . 1,514,705 1,494,705
All other debts . . 4,280,794 6,880,012
Liquid assets . . 2,142,943 2,788,020
Advances, etc. .. . 4,635,836 6,454,674
Premises . . . . 350,214 494,736
Apart from inscribed deposits, which may be
regarded as a fixed debt, six months ago the
bank owed £4,280,794 to the public and held
£2,142,943 liquid. Thus of every pound it
owed it had 10s. in the till or at short call.
Now its liabilities to the public total
£6,880,012 and it holds £2,788,020, or just
over Bs. of every £l, within easy reach. Thus
the holding of liquid assets (over 40 p.c.) is
still very strong. Regarded from another
point of view, at Dec. 31 last the A.B.C.
owed the public less than £3 ss. for every
£1 of its shareholders’ funds; now the
proportion has been increased to £5 2s. for
every £l of combined capital and reserves.
In Australia liabilities of under eight times
the. total funds is reckoned a safe working
basis. The book value of the old A.B.C. bank
premises at last balance was £350,214. and
those of the City £192.123. total £542,337.
The combined properties are now given a
book value of £494,730. some of the City’s
properties having been written down before
being taken over, and a few superfluous
branch offices having been sold. The item
will be still further reduced by the realisa-
tion of other premises not required.
Roughly, about £2,600,000 has been
tacked on to the A.B.C.’s figures bv the
acquisition of the City’s business. The
bank had previously reached the stage where
it badly wanted to extend ; and to get over
two millions of new business in a lump by the
simple process of buying out a smaller bank
was certainly a fine slice of good luck. It is
not worth while resurrecting the A.B.C.’s
past now except to show the solid progress
it has made. When in 1910 this co. took
over the old Australian Joint Stock Bank
it had over £980,000 of old assets (station
properties, etc.) on its hands. Though
severely written down, they were more or
less a dead weight. Gradually they were
unloaded, sometimes at a loss, and as there
was no contingency fund to meet the losses,
the earlier current profits suffered. By the
end of last year all but £60.895 of these assets
had been disposed of, and the directors stated
their intention of realising on the remnant
“at the earliest possible moment.” The
fact that for about 20 years the old A.. 1.8.
got practically no new customers made the
going difficult at first, but gradually the pub-
lic began to realise the undoubted strength
of the A.8.C.. with the result that in the
seven years prior to the purchase of (lie
City Bank deposits were nearly doubled.
The A.B.C.’s chief difficulty has been to find
profitable and safe employment for this new
money entrusted to its care, and also for the
cash got from tin* realisation of old proper-
ties.
The increase of £14,000-odd in the
past half-year’s profits represents about the
average of the profits that used to be earned
by the City. As a result of these increased
earnings the dividend has been lifted two
points to 5 p.c. The A.8.C., by the way.
has a lot of fairly cheap money in its
inscribed deposits. These deposits, totalling
£1,494,705, carry 4 p.c.; and they are prac-
tically perpetual, for under its articles the
bank is called upon to set aside only £15,000
each half-year to provide for repurchase.

Though the Cold Tea party has, been very
active in Bananaland—only the other day
its lady friends stormed the galleries of
Parliament House demanding six o’clock
closing—the Ryan Government refuses to
restrict pub trading hours. Considering the good
seasons the northern State has been ex-
periencing, and the artificial prosperity cre-
ated by the circulation of War Loan money,
one might reasonably expect the Queensland
Brewery to continue to show good profits.
But the record figures for the past year are
a surprise:—
1916. 1917. 1918.
Gross trading profits . . £45,989 £45,939 £60,433
Management expenses .. 34,934 35,716 46,791
The directors report that “the business has
improved considerably, and there is every
prospect of the improvement being main-
tained.” A plant for manufacturing lager
beer was installed during the year, and it
has produced “satisfactory results.” But
while this explains the leap in gross profits
nothing is said concerning the increase of
£ll,OOO in the item “salaries, wages, office
and other expenses, rents, rates, insurance,
depreciation, bad debts, etc., etc.” In this
way allowance for depreciation is made
behind drawn blinds. Whether, in view of
the record trading profit, considerably more
than usual has been written off for deprecia-
tion Tiie Bulletin does not know. The
question of depreciation brings us back to the
written-off column in the table. These
amounts represent votes to a contingency
account, now totalling £(>ssB. Seeing tfcat
depreciation is .otherwise provided for, there
is some doubt as to whether this sum should
not be included with reserves—particularly
in view of the fact that a couple of- years
ago an accumulation of £19,389 in' this
account was capitalised.
The co. has now been brewing beer for 80
years. Going back 10 years we get this
comparison:—
1908. 1915. 1916. 1917. 1918.
Capital . . £26,685 £60,000 £88,889 £92,185 £93,333
Liabilities 30,075 26,888 23,591 26,855 35,396
Land, plant &
properties 40,964 55,992 56,058 55,873 58,175
Stock .. 8,267 17,617 20,436 24,892 38,654
Book debts 9,521 38.570 35,646 40,183 39,484
Cash, etc... 379 10,030 11,529 12,527 12,997
Since 1908 £37.759 of new capital has been
got in (£28,889 of reserves were capitalised
in addition), and all other liabilities have
increased by £5321. Meantime. £17,211 has
been added to fixed assets; £30,387 to -stocks
arid £42,581 to book debts,and cash. Those
figures show 7 an improvement of over
£47,000 in 10 years. How the co. w 7 ill fare
in the future it is difficult to forecast. The
anti-liquor party may yet succeed in bring-
ing Bananaland into line with the other
States. This, however, is certain: in the
cold times ahead most people will find that
their pocket-money won’t permit them to
quench their thirst so often as formerly.

Rut the directors don’t put tin' 'half-year’s
results that way. They show the net profit
“after maintaining steamers and plant in
thorough order and providing for deprecia-
tion. etc.," as £14.117. which barely covers
the dividend. The difference between the
net profit shown by the c-o. and the figures
shown in table is explained by an addi-
tion of £2750 to the reserve for the equalisa-
tion of dividends, and a further £277 odd to
bring the public risk fund to a round
£14,500. If you looked no further than at
what the directors call the net profits for
the past couple of years you might reason-
ably ask why the J3J p.c. dividend is being
maintained. Accepting the directors’ “net
profits” for the past four terms, it will be
found that the total has been £51,123.
while £56,324 has been distributed to share-
holders. If you dig into the accounts still
further you will find that despite the pay-
ing out in dividend form of more than is
shown as net profit, the cash position has
actually improved in the two years. Here
are the figures, giving alfjo a comparison
over five years:—
, , June,’l3. June,’lo. June,’lS.
Assets other than steamers,
freehold and plant . . £71,243 £108,973 £159,237’
Liabilities 1,724 1,918 1,568
Surplus liquid assets. . £09,519 £107,055
Thus the increase in the surplus of liquid
assets in two years has been £20.614. and
of that improvement no less than £15,921 is
in hard cash at the bank. As previously
stated, net profits are shown after provid-
ing for an unspecified amount of deprecia-'
tion and after deducting maintenance
charges. So the net profit shown for any
particular term is entirely dependent upon
the allowances which the directors make.
The Manly ferry co. has been a remark-
able success. The original capital was
£25,000, and in 1906 £4335 of debentures
were converted: total, £29,335. Present
paid-up capital is £211,212 (281,616 £1
shares paid to 155.), but not one penny of
that added capital has been put up in cash
by shareholders. The whole of the differ-
ence of £181,877 represents capitalised
profits. During the past dozen years this
co.’s customers, besides providing handsome
dividends for shareholders, have presented
it with every one of the splendid steamers
added to the service, and have further
helped it to pile up a cash surplus of
over £125,000. Recent years have not
been quite so glittering as formerly. Dur-
ing the four years 1909-’l3, besides paying
£72,164 in divs., the co. purchased out of
the profits of that period three of its finest
steamers—the Bellubera, Balgowlah and
Barrenjoey—-and was able to accumulate
£24,000 of cash in addition. No new ves-
sel has been built since 1913, but £126,729
has been paid in dividends, equal to 60 p.c.
on the heavily-watered capital, and a further
£57,572 of cash has been accumulated. No
doubt the increased cost of coal and stores
and Wages Board awards have cut into
recent profits.

r lhis co. has a lease of the Melbourne
Theatre Royal, and as the lease is a perish-
able asset, the management has to provide
for the return of the £31.509 of capital
represented by leasehold assets. Probably
more than that amount will need to be
accumulated, for unless the lease is renewed
at the end of tin' 30 years or so it still has
to run, a lot of the plant will also be of
little value. This shows (he progress that
has been made in piling up liquid assets:—

Assets other than buildings,
freeholds, plant, etc. .. £337 £11,600
Less liabilities .. ~ 605 2,844
Excess liabilities .. ..£268
Surplus assets £8,756
The present liabilities include £2OOB ad-
vanced by the bank under tin' last War Loan
scheme, and no less than £11,(116 of the
assets is invested in War Loan. In the
past eight years the co. has thus improved its
cash position by over £9000: or an average of
over £llOO per annum. If the co. can con-
tinue to add to its sinking fund at the
same rate for the next seven years, and an
interest of 44 pa*, can be earned on the lot.
when the lease expires there would be suffi-
cient (o return tip' whole of (lie capital of
£48.000. The co. is at present laying out
£•‘-500 to make the front of the house more,
attractive, but apart from structural altera-
tion. the sub-lessees. ,T. ('. Williamson. Ltd.,
have to provide for all repairs, renewals,
painting and decoration. Incidentally, when
J.C.W., Ltd., in 1912 asked for a further
10 years’ sub-lease, extending it to the
middle of 1925, “considerably increased
rent” was agreed upon. So the eo. is now
benefiting from this added revenue.
Westralia, with seven deficits in succession
and the foundations of the eighth one already
laid, is having a poor time. Here are some
figu res:—
Year Year’s

Other States had their booms one by one, but
Westralia had them all at once—gold boom,
land boom, immigration boom and borrowing
boom. And it borrowed; even in the days
when the great gold output should have made
it independent, of loans, at such a rate that
it advanced from having no debt at all in
1871 and the smallest debt per head in 1891
to having the biggest debt apart from war
debts per head in Australasia, and the big-
gest one on earth and the biggest one on
record in 1917. These are a few samples of
how the Westralian debt went up, and how
it compared with the average of the States:

1911 .. 82 13 0 59 99 23 3 3
1917 . . 132 12 3 76 1 7 56 10 8
There is a sinking fund which reduces the
debt to £ll6 ss. 9d. per head against a
general average of £74 os. 3d.
The gold output was the really solid foun-
dation of the boom, for paper land values
and loans were far from solid. The gold out-
put went something like this (the recorded
output before 188 G was nil) :
1886 .. £1,148 1911 .. £5,823,075
1891 .. 115,182 1914 .. 5,237,353
1901 . . 7,235,653 1915 . . 5,140,228
1903 .. 8,770j719 1916 .. 4,508,532
1904 .. 8,424,226 1917 .. 4,121,645
1905 . . 8,305,654
The present year promises to be at the rate
of about £3,700,000. The three years 1903-
4-5 were the only ones in which the figure
went abdve £8,000,000, and for a population
of about 230,000 it wasn’t bad—about £3O
per head per annum or £.lBO for a family of
five. And if the State hadn’t done the very
biggest borrowing just when it had least need
to borrow all might have been well to-day.
The revenues were wonderful in the roar-
ing days when the State borrowed more than
was ever dreamed of before because it was
rich and didn’t require to borrow. Here are
some samples :
Westralian Average Revenue Westralian
Revenue of Six States excess
per head. per head. per head.
1891 . . .£9 19 1 £7 16 2 £2 2 11

1916 .. 16 16 11 10 2 4 6 14 7
1918 . . 14 18 8 10 14 1 4 4 7
It is still the biggest peace revenue on earth.
Incidentally, the deficit (£2 ss. 7d. per head)
is the biggest peace deficit on earth. The'
great trouble is that the interest on the
public debt absorbs between one-third and
one-half of the revenue. This is an item
that can’t be retrenched. And it is part of
Westralia’s curious luck that the rate of in-
terest it pays is lower than that of any other
State except Victoria, because it did most
of its borrowings with a rush at a time of
cheap money. So if any of its renewals fall
due in the time of dear money that has come
it will have a bigger increase than the aver-
age to' face. Westralia receives a special
allowance from the Commonwealth on a slid-
ing scale—£2so,9oo in 1911, £240,000 in
1912. and so on down to £lOO.OOO in 1920.
when it expires. It shares, of course, in the
general Commonwealth subsidy, which also
expires in 1920. If the war is still going
strong in 1920, these aids may not be re-
newed, and then strange things may happen
to more States than one.

“Drink for the beast is food for thought” is a 20th
century proverb that should interest every stock-
owner —for on the purity of the water they drink
depends in a. great measure the health o 1 your
stock. One pound of aluminoferric will quickly
clarify up to 2000 gallons of water, precipitating all
impurities and leaving the water clear and pure in a
very short time. Use it in your wells or dams •

Farmers aud Settlers’ conference of 1917. It
was formed towards the end of July last
year, and under the Government acquisition
scheme was appointed a receiving agent to
handle 12.2 p.c. of the season's crop. Alto-
gether 1.182.000 bags passed through its
hands, and while the eo. took little risk,
being little more than a receiving agent, it
earned commissions totalling £27.198. After
paying out £12,879 expenses of . handling and
£2883 administration exes, there remained it
profit of £11.480. Out of this the £852 of
preliminary expenses were written off. and
also a further £5302. representing a third of
the total cost of stacking materials. There
thus remained a net profit of £5320.
Considered solely from a co-operative point
of view the operations for the year were not
altogether satisfactory, due entirely to the
Government’s method of restricting the co.
to certain districts. Thus it was unable to
handle the crop of a number of shareholders
outside those centres. ’The idea in a co-
operative concern like this is to pay a decent
rate of interest on capital and distribute the
balance of profits not required for the busi-
ness in the form of bonus on consignments.
A number of shareholders were thus deprived
of participating in any such bonds that
might have been distributed ; so the directors
decided merely to pay a dividend of 10 p.c.
on capital and declare no bonus. This divi-
dend absorbed £1879. and leaves £2948 to
lie carried forward. For the coming season,
however, the Government has abandoned its
allocation scheme, and all the wheat agents
will have to fight for business. The F. and
8. Co-op. is jubilant about this decision,
because now it has got on its feet and
demonstrated that it can save money for the
farmer, it anticipates handling considerably
more of the crop than would come its way
under any allocation scheme. llow the co-
operative idea has caught on is shown by the
applications for shares that are flowing in. At
April 30, 27,581 shares had been allotted;
to the end of July. 12,500 additional shares
had been applied for. Under careful manage-
ment this co. should grow into a very big con-
cern. Its objects are admirable. A co.
which sets out to brighten the life of the
man on the land by securing for him an in-
creased return for his products is doing a
national work. The farmer has been bitten
so often by the city shark that he has grown
exceedingly suspicious of new schemes. In
this case, however, it is his own association
that has launched this co-operative co.
But so many promising co-operative
cos. have come a buster by over-
reaching themselves in their infancy that a
word of caution does not seem out of place.
At the annual meeting the directors asked for
and were given power “to extend co-opera-
tion to other lines as soon as lie necessary
organisation can be completed and permission
obtained from the Federal authorities, to
handle produce, insurance, jute, general stock
agency and the killing and distribution of
meat.’’ The co. is still an infant, and so far
it has been hand-fed by the Government
wheat-acquisition scheme. The right time to
rush into handling live and dead meat and
insurance will be when the co. can show
that it has made a success of its wheat
business under normal conditions, and is
strong enough to fight any competition from
the old-established cos.
Paper Pulp, Ltd.—This co. is being
formed to acquire the assets and rights of
the Cairns Paper Pulp Syndicate, which for
the past IS months has been working on a
small scale on Joseph Campbell’s process of
converting blady grass and other plants into
paper pulp. The limit of the present plant
is a ton per week, and as one mill alone is
prepared to contract to take several times
that quantity regularly, the promoters of the
present co. anticipate for a start installing a
plant capable of 10 tons per week, and to
acquire the rights to all suitable vegetation
on 150 acres of North Queensland coastal
Crown lands. There is no doubt about the
supplies of raw material, and the promoters
say they can get it to the mill at a cost of
255. per ton. The cost of producing pulp
with the existing small plant and with the
present abnormal prices of chemicals is £lO
per ton ; and the syndicate has been receiv-
ing £l5 for its product f.o.b. Cairns. A fur-
ther inducement is the Federal Government’s
bonus of 15 p.c. on sales of local pulp when
50 tons are produced. Experiments with
blady grass have shown it to possess similar
high-class properties as esparto, from which
superior paper is made. The co., which will
have Joseph Campbell as its. mill-manager
and chemist, is setting out to demonstrate
that good paper can be produced on a com-
mercial basis in Australia. Capital is to be
£6000—6000 shares of £1 each; 2000 full-
paids being paid for the syndicate’s outfit,
.‘5OOO being offered to the public (paid to 10s.
on allotment, the remainder being callable at
2s. 6d. per month) and 1000 shares held in
reserve. Thos. M. Shakespeare, secretary of
the N.S.W. Country Press Association, is
attending to the preliminaries.
Broken Hill South shareholders are to
meet in Melbourne on the 30th to discuss the
reconstruction scheme outlined in The
Bulletin some weeks ago. The directors
explain the reasons for reconstruction :
Many shareholders have expressed the wish that
the actual value of each share (generally, as now.
greatly exceeding its nominal or par valjie) should
lie subdivided, so as to be represented by several
shares of collectively the same value, and it lias
been urged that in this form the shares should be a
more attractive investment. Shareholders are aware
that some of the shares in this eo. are fully paid up
to £l, and others are contributing, paid up to
only 9s. (id.—a difference of 10s. 6d. in favor of
the fully paid-up shares. Your directors are advised
that, under the existing circumstances, it would be
impracticable to effect the desired subdivision except
by some process of reconstruction.
Further, they state
The war and other causes have materially en-
larged the scope and the character and the national
importance of the business of most large Australian
mining cos. The South, second to none in import-
ance at Broken Hill, is. however, in an exceptionally
disadvantageous position, for, being incorporated
under the no-liability system, with restricted powers
not capable of expansion, doubts and difficulties con-
stantly arise as obstacles in the way of the co. taking
its proper part in the national and profitable develop-
ment of those metal and allied industries which the
Commonwealth Government has so strongly sought to
encourage.
Present capital consists of 200,000 shares of
£1 each: 1 30,908 fully paids and 69,092 paid
to 9s. Od. The new co. will have an author-
ised capital of £BOO,OOO in 800.000 shares of
£1 each. To bring the paid-lips and contribs.
into line it is proposed to pay the former
10s. (id. per share in cash. Then for every
share in the present co. four fully-paid £1
shares will be issued in the new co. The
usual quarterly 6s. divs. payable in Septem-
ber and December next have been earmarked
from the old co.’s assets. Besides freeing
the South from many of the disabilities it is
now working under as a no-liability co., and
giving the co. power to extend its interests
if considered advisable, the stock will be
much handier from a market point of view.

The preliminary clean-up about the Edna
Deeps mine and management cleared away
most of the mud before the half-yearly meet-
ing was held in Melbourne. It ended in Heal
admitting lie was a bit of an amateur and in
Duff fathering everyone in his big-hearted
way. The net result to the dust-up was the
retirement of Ileal from the Board and the
election of H. W. Marsh, a Sydney man.
Stuckey also intends to stand down perma-
nently, and does so with his colors fixed
fast to the poppet legs he is leaving behind
at Westonia. Rumor is confirmed that one
Campbell Shaw, of the Ida 11., will take over
Stuckey’s old job- His estimate of ore re-
serves will be eagerly awaited. Director
Marsh is giving the new manager a bit to
think over when he throws in a word favor-
able to amalgamation between Edna Deeps
and Edna Central. Vested interests have
their talons firm in both shows. The Deeps
folk certainly don’t want to be submerged
any more by the Central group than they
wish to be flooded out by Edna May water.
The suggestion may account for the yarn
that Giblin was to run both shows, and that
his Board jibbed at the double job.
* -'/r * *
From Westonia :—-
In his report for the half-year ended November 30.
1917, Edna Deep Levels manager Stuckey stated the
ore reserves above No. 3 level were 9520 tons, worth
40s. per ton, and 5000 tons (total 14,520 tons)
valued at 20s. In his report for the following six
months Stuckey reported that only 5000 tons remain
at the No. 3 level. Now, as only about 6000 tons were
treated during the six months, and not a quarter of
that quantity came from the N 0.3 level, how is the dis-
crepancy explained ? Stuckey adds that 12,000 tons
remain at the No. 4 and 20,000 tons at No. 5
level. As the Mines Department will not permit
the 12,000 tons to be mined, what is the value of it?
Regarding the 20,000 tons, the officially reported
widths and length of the ore body do not permit
a result of 20,000 tons being arrived at. What
method of calculation was employed to bring about
a result of 20,000 tons ? The maximum width of
the reef at No. 5 level is stated to be only 13ft.,
but immediately above the level the horizontal width
is stated to be 25ft. over a length of 30ft. The
public is not concerned with the horizontal width,
but the actual width. The manager's report con-
cludes with the statement that there is no geological
change at the bottom of the mine. Possibly not,
but there is a decided change in the nature of the
reef, which has decreased in width to a figure averag-
ing between 3ft. and 13ft. The fact that no
geological change is noticeable appears to indicate
that the reef will continue its recent unsatisfactory
behavior at greater depth.
By crushing ore of higher grade though
of smaller tonnage Golden Horseshoe
(W.A.) last year netted a profit of £lOO,BOO.
compared with £54,500 for the previous 12
months. Two dividends aggregating ss. 6d.
per share were paid. Ore reserves show an
increase both in tonnage and value, and are
now estimated to be over four years ahead
of the mill. The manager writes cheerfully
of the future, and in a word or two about
the past mentions that £3,375,000 have been
paid in dividends since 1899. Though little
more than a skeleton of its former self the
mine is progressing fairly well, and will be
going long after most if not all the shows
now working at Kalgoorlie have passed
away. #
Perth Mining Association, with its usual
assertiveness, is agitating for a bonus of £1
per oz. on gold, and also greater security ot
tenure as an incentive to increased produc-
tion. With the first part of its request
prospectors agree, but they are up against
any attempt to obtain "greater, security of
tenure." What prospectors say is wanted is
the rigid enforcement of present labor condi-
tions. and make certain persons, who it is
believed are egging the Mining Association,
to either work their holdings or make room
for someone else who will.
* * * *
"Edo” : Even if the proposal to subsidise
gold production with a bonus of 20s. per oz.
were given effect to, in many instances the
bonus would not be sufficient. Where ore
bodies are broad, rich and non-refractory, no
assistance is necessary. But take the case
of, say, 7dwt. stuff, which is hard to get in
quantity, and which cannot be easily treated,
in pre-war times it would mostly pay to
handle the rock. Now it costs at least ss.
per ton more to do so, even where there are
well-set-up plants under competent manage-
ments. Thus, for the 7dwt. dirt, allowing
for loss in residues, the really well-equipped
mine would have to handle three tons
to get less than an ounce of metal. The
bonus would just about cover the extra cost
imposed by war conditions, but it is almost a
certainty that labor would claim a share of
the bonus.
Since the Golden Ridge Co. gave up, a
working party of miners who bought the
show for £l7OO have, besides making good
wages, already paid off £l2OO out of gold
won. And they are still on payable dirt.
* * * *
Even with the help of John Friel’s moun-
taineering skill Loch Fyne lingers in the
long list of the Woods Point (Vic.) has-
beens. There is 700 ft. by 240 ft. of a dyke to
poke about in below where the Tricks crowd
snicked so much gold in the 'nineties, but
bad fuel, water troubles and lack of efficient
labor checks development. Friel’s objective
is to get to the south, where the downward
extension of the southern group of reefs
should be got. To the north he has cut some
veins about big enough to inspire a hatter,
but his wood-supply cut out; so opening out
has to be postponed till he can-get out into
the forest. This is only a pastime. The real
game is to get the lower workings going,
which can and will be done directly fine
weather sets in.
The Central Plateau,,, the last show on
the Sebastopol field (Vic.) is realising its
assets. The whole field is waterlogged ; the
great subterranean chambers like reservoirs.
The Sebastopol field, for its size, was pro-
bably as great as any in Australia. From
the Star of the East alone an average of an
ounce to the ton was taken out year after
year. Twenty-two alluvial mining com-
panies operating in the Sebastopol gone
yielded £4,250,927 worth of gold. The
quartz reefs operated by the eight leading
cos. yielded £1,983,000, and returned £422,000
in dividends.
* * * *
Tin at £4OO per ton and plenty of water
is putting most of the Speck's tin shows on
the dividend-list. During July Bischoff
handed out ss. per share; Bischoff Ex-
tended, 6d.; Briseis, 6d.; Arba, Gd.; .Pioneer,
Is.; and quite a host of little shows which
are not on the. list are doing well. Also a
lot of Tongkah Harbor’s 3s. diy. comes to the
Speck. Holders of tin scrip in Tassy cannot
recall a more affluent iftonth.
* -r * *
The old Neville wolfram show in the Chil-
lagoe (Q.) district has crushed 250 tons for
a return, of 30 tons concentrates worth,
roughly, ’£sooo. The Neville was a famous
show in the early days, but the pipe of ore
was of little value near the surface and re-
mained hidden for years. The shaft on the
new shoot is only Gsft. down. Queensland
produced £58,367 worth of wolfram last
year, the bulk of it coming from Chillagoe.
* -if * -X-
Herberton district (N.Q.) is feeding half a
dozen batteries, w’hich crushed 2504 tons of
stone in June for a return of 57 tons tin
concentrates, worth £ll.OBl. There are 71
little claims to divide this amount, and the
best return comes from the old Vulcan at
Irvinebank, which sent 196 tons to the local
mill for seven tons concentrates, worth
£II7G. Prospecting the old workings above
the 300 ft. level resulted in the discovery of a
patch of good ore. The Bischoff mill is now
rented by some Watsonville miners, who
crushed 490 tons of ore for tin worth £l3OO.
# * * *
The New’ Ravenswood, near Charters
Towers, and one of the largest gold shows in
the North, has changed hands, Arthur H.
Ha sell, of Sydney, being the purchaser. For
about 20 years this mine has been worked by
an English co. and has been the mainstay of
the Ravenswood district. Its chief trouble
in recent years has been want of capital for
further exploratory work. Gold was first
discovered on the field in 1868, and the total
output has been worth over four millions.
* * * *
During the years 1914-17 Rand divs. de-
creased from £8.000.000 to £0.500,000 per
annum, although in the same period the out-
put increased from £34,000,000 to £37,000.0UU.
In the last three years costs had increased
by, over £5,000,000 per annum, of which 3[
millions represented increased cost of mine
supplies, £OOO,OOO war bonuses and increases
in wages and £350,000 allowances to em-
ployees on active service.

“Melb" : Carlo Catani, who died this week,
was a native of Florence, Italy ; born 1552
After training as an engineer, he came to
Australia with astronomer Baracchi, and
the singer Oeechi, a tutor of Melba. Catani
entered the Vie. Lands Department, trans-
ferred to the Public Works and displayed his
ingenuity both in harbor works and roads and
bridges. He became Chief Engineer. In
railway work his Italian knowledge was
especially valuable. He also developed
Mount Buffalo as a tourist haunt. Mel-
bourne knew him best as designer of the
improvements on the south bank of the

“The Oldest Inhabitant’s” note
A link with the earliest Australian pioneers passed
out at Epping (N.S.W.) recently. Percival Sydney
Oakes, youngest son of Rowland Hassall Oakes, of
Bathurst, was a Parramatta native and son of Francis
Oakes, Chief Constable of that old town in the lung
ago. In 1796 the Church Missionary Society sent
in the ship Duff a number of missionaries to
Tahiti. Amongst them was Rowland Hassall, his
wife and two small boys, William Shelley and
Francis Oakes. In March, 1798, a number of the
missionaries, including those named, arrived in Port
Jackson in the little ship Nautilus. Francis Oakes
married a daughter of Sergeant Small, who was born
somewhere near old Government House, September 22,
1789, and died January 30, 1883. It was claimed
for this girl that she was the first white child born
in Australia —which is scarcely likely.
11. P. Owen, of Sydney. Master in Equity,
who has resigned the office after 10 years’
service to become legal adviser to a leading
insurance co., is son of Robert Owen, a
former District Court Judge and later an
M.L.C. (1868-78). lI.P. is an East Mait-
land lad, educated at Sydney Grammar, Syd-
ney and Oxford Universities. lie was
called to the Bar at Inner Temple, 1885.
W. A. Parker, a native of Orange, succeeds
Owen as Master in Equity. He is 46 years
of age, was educated at Newington and
Sydney University, and was called to the
Bar in May. 1600. He acted as Master in
1616, while 11. P. Owen was in England.
John Keays passed out last week, and
Daylesford (Vic.) dropped its flag to half-
mast. Keays was a Limerick man who came
to Victoria 60 years ago and ran a Ballarat
line of coaches for Cobb and Co. When the
rush to Jim Crow diggings happened Keays
opened coach roads round about, and when
Daylesford had developed out of the Jim
Crow rush he settled there and was honored
as a father. Early in the century John sold
the Cobb and Cu. business and made his home
in Melbourne.
With the passing of the Central Plateau
Co.. W. M. Acheson. big man of Bal-
larat mining managers, retires, in his
82nd year, after controlling various Sebas-
topol ventures for over half a century. Sixty-
three years ago he was assistant
at Melbourne Public Library,
then he acquired a quartz bat-
tery at Egerton and became
secretary to Ebenezer Syme,
brother of David. Mining soon
absorbed all his energies, and
for many years he looked after
the business side of the Band of
Loch Co.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”:
Apropos Nurse Singleton’s
grandfather (B. 23/7/MS), lie
was a Dublin doctor, born in
1808. A brother, who had been
a curate at Finglas (an historic
suburb of Dublin), a married
man with nine children, finding
that he was starving on his
curate’s stipend, in 1848 emi-
grated to Melbourne in the hope
that Bishop Perry would find
him a payable job. Dr. Single-
ton left Plymouth in the ship
Harpley, and landed on San-
dridge (now Port Melbourne) in
January, 1851. Up to 1858
there was an agitation for an
inquiry into the state of the
prison hulks in Hobson’s Bay,
and Singleton was in the lead.
The Age, then battling for a
living, published all the copy
the agitators liked to send, and
the paper by some means
reached the prisoners on the
hulks. John Price (afterwards murdered
by the convicts) forbade Singleton’s visits to
the hulks and Pentridge Gaol; on the ground
that he was obtaining information from the
convicts which he used against the adminis-
tration.
The Croix de Guerre has been awarded by
the French War Office to Angus Ferguson, an
Adelaide lawyer, and sent on to South Aus.
Ferguson was a quiet citizen who gave up his
commission in the local forces to enlist as a
private for active service, where he soon won
his way up. He was killed at Tillers Bre-
tonneux.

Church, opposite St. Pat’s Cathedral; it is
now run by Heathcote, who discourses on
anti-Romanism and kindred topics. Sin-
claire, always with a kink of the extreme
socialist, found the surroundings little to his
liking. Of late years he has been lecturing
in Melb. Socialist Hall on Sabbath evenings.
A Master of Arts, he was chosen as assistant
lecturer in English to Archibald Strong at
Melb. University. In his youth he was in
the running for the first Maoriland Rhodes
scholarship.

of the State and Federal Houses. The late
T.R. began by sleeper-cutting for the railway
line from Parramatta to Penrith, and later
joined his brother-in-law (the late John
Thurston) as contractor for the Blacktown-
to-Richmond line. He was a partner for
some time of John Woods, ex-Mayor of Syd-
ney, in a carrying and forwarding business"to
the Western districts. As a farmer he leased
1000 acres in the Bathurst district from the
late Edward Coombes, and harvested the first
1000 acres of wheat grown in N. S. Wales,
lie was hotelkeeping at different times,
amongst the various houses kept by him being

C. F. Kummick. just dead at Tweed-
vale (is.A.). was one of the old pioneers of
German stock who came to the State in
such numbers in the eighteen-forties. He
settled at Lobethal. in the Adelaide hills. 70
years ago, has been a good Australian citi-
zen ever since, and leaves about 60 descend-
ents of three generations. He helped to
found the local woollen factory, now famous,
and made a strong, though not yet
thoroughly successful effort to get cricketers
to use bats made of the local willow. lie
had an iron constitution, and boasted of
never having had any use for a doctor. But,
for this he might not have lived to see the 7
old German names regarded with suspicion.
Even the town he helped so greatly to build
up has had its name altered to “Tweedvale,”
which refers to its chief industry.
“Ivolack”: At the recent distribution of
Royal Humane awards in Melbourne, Cap-
tain Bruce, M.C., gave it as his opinion that
‘‘no act required such surpassing qualities of
valor” as that of John William McKenzie,
a farmer of Lambton (N.S.W.), who went
into a well at Warwick (Q.) to try and
rescue two men who had
been overcome by foul air.
McKenzie got the Clarke
Silver Medal, and F. W.
Warr, of Warwick, his
brave assistant, the Society’s
bronze medal. In 1895. be-
fore the war gave various
plucky padres their chance,
one James Tonkin, then a
mine engine-driver at Cali-

When Tom Gumming
passed out at Melbourne the
other day he was holding
down a job on the Licenses
Reduction Board. Seventy-
six years ago he was born
in Melbourne (then Port
Phillip) at the corner of
Flinders and Elizabeth
streets. With brother John
he took up the Mount Vio-
let, Mount Fyans and Stony
Point runs, in the Western
District, and made a name
as a breeder of pure merinos.
Later he acquired an addi-
tional station on the Darling
River and became a founder
of the Australian Sheep-
breeders’ Association, acted
as its secretary, and was
made its only life member.
He was also at various times presi-
dent of the Royal Agricultural Society and
a member of the House of Fat (as a sup-
porter of Duncan Gillies) and of the Closer
Settlement Board.
One of the quietest even of soft-goods men
was J. W. Porter, dead in Adelaide at 08.

man, about 40 years ago, to build up the
great Bundle-street drapery business, which
is now Marshall and Co. His one interest
outside the business was cattle-breeding, and
he made good use of the Holstein strain on
ms country place at Victor Harbor. It is
sa id that he had never in all his life, and
despite all his money, been outside the bor-
ders of S. Aus.
Francis Bligh's (Ilarbottle, Alsop and
Co. ) appointment to' the directorate of Tooths,
Limited, Sydney, recalls the fact that in the
mid fifties the firm established in Melbourne
was Biigli and Ilarbottle (Francis John
Bligh's private residence was at St. Ivilda).
the country-house and stores were on the
west side of South Queen-street, between the
old Wool pack Inn and the Queen's Head
Hotel. A near neighbor was Tom Stubbs,
portly auctioneer, one time of Sydney 7. The
\\ oolpack had a capacious cellar in which,
it was said, the gold stolen from the Nelson,
in 18.»2. was equally divided amongst the
thieves and the “receivers.”
THE BEST ALTERNATIVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
‘Damnation’ is to disappear from the Anglican
1 raver Book and New Testament.” —News item.
Some statements one time held in doubt or fear,
W hieh parsons urged me to my soul to grapple.
Are now but subjects for a passing sneer,
Like Eden and the Eve who ate the Apple:
i lie Serpent wise that tempted Adam’s donah
Seems cousin to the whale that swallowed Jonah.
My faith ih good old yarns 1 had to waive.
My head of fond beliefs was shorn and shaven ;
1 thought Elijah, hiding in a cave,
Deceived liis frugal tucker from a raven:
But now, as sober truth (the first was tipsy),
1 m told Elijah’s raven was a gipsy.
The needle’s-eye, where through the camel sought
\ ainly to pass, in times that seem so olden,
Was not a needle’s eye, as erst 1 thought
But just a gateway in Jerush the Golden;
Ami now, disturbed by honest indignation,
I find the pars'ns have disowned Damnation!
Is (here no 11—1, where certain men may burn
K°r all eternity, and get no quarter,
Whilst we grin down the Pit, and watch ’em yearn
And beg and pray for cooling draughts of water?
I a me it seems the very worst of errors
To rob Eternity of all its terrors.
1 was not ourselves (whose future seemed so fair)
That visions of Damnation had affrighted:
A heaven of perfumed space and ether rare
Was what our optimistic eyes had sighted:
The tire and brimstone, burning blue and yellow,
Were punishments to suit the other fellow.
Denied them half our joy in life is gone:
We talked of wearing wings and singing praises
Amidst the Clouds, but, in an undertone,
We all consigned our foes to Hell and Blazes;
In blissful ignorance, ere J grew wiser,
1 dreamed of endless, torment for the Kaiser.
But since it cannot be that holy mirth
M ill shake our sides in yonder azure crescent,
Fate must decree a perfect hell on earth
For "William, to delight us in the present.
A hope of merry Hell for Bill we cherish,
Where he will wail for Peace, and,' wailing, perish.
VICTORIA.

CLEAR CONSCIENCE.
HUBBY : “Anyone with half an eye could see
you were made up!"
WIFIE : “Really? Well, my consolation is
that I am not wilfully deceiving any-
one."
One man’s meat is another man’s profit.
Bagdad was entered in March, 'l7, and
within a month Arabs were being set to
work clearing out the long-disused Euphrates
and Tigris canals, so that on the ililleh
branch alone nearly 100 silted-up channels
have been brought into use, 300,000 aerosol
irrigable land brought under cultivation, and
this year the biggest harvest since the days
of Nebuchadnezzar is expected. Of course
it isn’t all philanthropy; abundant local
food supplies will largely, reduce the need
for oversea shipping and local railway ton-
nage, besides yielding an appreciable cash
saving. Contrast that with the way the
Hun has “developed” Belgium and Rou-
mania. And the peace prattlers want us
to hand Mesopotamia back to the Unspeak-
able!

“E.”: A Sydney lieutenant, a recent M.C.
and the first member of the A.I.F. to be deco-
rated with the Russian Medal of St. George,
writes home that there isn’t much glamor
surrounding an investiture nowadays at
Buckingham Palace. The ceremony is not
very impressive, he explains, but certainly is
very amusing. On arrival at the Palace the
Staff direct you to your pen by announcing
“Y.C.’s this way; M.C.’s first to the right;
D.S.O.’s second on the left.” You next find
yourself in a huge room with a couple of
hundred of others, all up for M.C.’s. Your
name is checked a few times and another
chap comes in with a large box of hooks
rather like small hooks for hanging pictures.
The Chief Hooker attaches one to your left
breast. Eventually you are lined up in the
order in which your name appears on the
list, and the long queue files out to meet the
King. H.M. stands in a large room with a
big box of medals in front of him. You
march to a point opposite him, halt, left
turn, take two paces forward and stand to
attention. The usual bow and then with a
sweep of the arm the King “lobs” the medal
on your hook with great accuracy. Pie
shakes hands with you, you bow and make
off through a side door. At this stage you
find that all is not yet over. On the track
out you come in contact with more Staff at
another large table, and here you say good-
bye to your hook. It is put away carefully
to be utilised again on some future occasion.
That concludes the business, save that you
have to pass through a huge crowd outside
the Palace.
The high price of meat and the distressing
infrequency of eggs have had a peculiar
effect on the peace of liege subjects in Mel-
bourne, owing to the planting of a lordly
rooster and his seraglio in every second subur-
ban back yard. The result is a cloud-tearing
clamor that has driven the half of the popu-
lation that doesn’t keep chickens to the
columns of the papers in a vindictive frame
of mind, turbulent with protestation.
Authority declares it is not empowered to
suppress the too demonstrative hen’s hus-
band, and in some districts organised
descents upon clamorous fowlhouses have
resulted, and the people have taken the
matter in their own hands and screwed
necks so tight that roosters have died, hope-
less of ever unwinding them. This is the
hour —appears the man. His name is Wright,
and _he produces a patent silencer to be
applied to raucous roosters. His silencer
is described as an effective gag, which en-
tirely suppresses the crowing of the bird,
but permits of its eating. Wright thinks the
use of his gag should be made compulsory.
So it should ; so it should. It is magnificently
adapted for the use of win-by-jaw politicians.

“L.L.W.” : Seems to me that the educational
faddists of N. S. Wales have
excelled themselves in getting
Japanese introduced into cer-
tain Sydney schools. Before
the language can be mastered —
or rather, partially mastered —
the student must swat for eight
years. And its commercial pos-
sibilities are very limited. Yet
N. S. Wales’s Education De-
partment, so far, has refused to
sanction the introduction of
Esperanto, the auxiliary lan-
guage which can be completely
mastered in 12 months. For
commercial purposes, Esperanto
may be used after only three
months’ study. Large classes
of teachers, under the auspices
of the Bananaland Education Department,
are being taught the easy artificial tongue in
Brisbane.

The advantages of a 10-hour working day
may be ascertained from the Mental Hospi-
tal attendants in Victoria. They work 601
hours per week at a nerve-straining and
wearying job, and they receive, warders from
£l2O to £l6B a year, nurses from £7B to
£lOB. Possibly the idea is that they require
less leisure than most workers as they have
so little money to spend.

The Cunard Co. has added two big wooden
steamships, partly oak but mostly pine, to
its fleet, just to keep the pot flying or the
flag boiling or something till times improve.
Many ships of the same sort are building,
but when the solid, unimaginative old Cunard
goes into the business it is plain that the
wooden ark has become respectable. This
country has a fair amount of timber on the
coast or along the rivers—Gippsland, the
N. S. Wales northern rivers, the north-east
of Queensland and the south-west of West-
ralia may be mentioned ; and there are spots
where ships could be built almost at the
foot of the tree instead of dragging the tree
to the biggest possible city. Considering
that all Australia’s external trade is done
by sea, and that we lacked steel plates to
build with, the wooden-ship idea has appealed
to many people. But Hughes, the prophet
who never prophesies till the event is dead
and buried, decided against it in an elo-
quent speech some two years ago. Now no
less than 24 belated wooden craft are on

order, one for each month of lost time, and
they are to be put together on the contract
system which was repudiated so strenuously
in the recent days when it was held that any
old time would be time enough. Incidentally
18 of them are to be built beside the dense
forests of the Parramatta River.

It is complained very reasonably that
there is cause for lamentation in the num-
ber of boys who leave school to rush into
occupations that lead nowhere and leave them
superannuated at the age of 20 or so with-
out trade, profession or habits of steady
industry. Messengers, news-boys and odd-
jobbers of that sort aren’t, as a rule, on the
way to, great wealth or great usefulness.
Perhaps if there were more trades to learn
it might improve things, for there isn’t room
for the whole population at wharf-lumping.
Possibly the street newspaper boy might be
prohibited. The N. S. Wales Education
Minister’s remedy, of course, is to increase
the expenditure of his department by keep-
ing the kids longer at school; but neither
keeping them longer in the nursery, or in
school, or in church, or even in gaol, or in
a state of -unconsciousness through chloro-
form seems to really affect the question.
THE HIDE OF SOME PEOPLE.
“ There's no doubt the poor devils are
scandalously underpaid .”
“Yes, but it’s just like their Up to ask for
more!”
“The Oldest Inhabitant” rattles the chains:
Parramatta Gaol, which is to be converted into
a mental hospital, dates from the seventeen nineties,
though it is not the same building that is to change
its name. The newer gaol, before the one at
Bathurst was erected, held the most noted criminris,
sent there after Cockatoo Island, in Port Jackson, wf;s
abandoned as a prison. The first man hanged on
the “new scaffold” in Darlinghurst Gaol was one
Kelly, for a murderous assault on Mr. McLaren, the
works overseer; and later yet one of “Moonlight’s”
gang, doing a commuted life sentence, was executed
for an assault with a knife on a fellow convict, who
was doing ten years for cutting the throat of a race-
horse out Hay way.

Eusapia Palladino (B. 25/7/T8) was
exposed in New York, and Hugo Munster-
berg gives the facts in his “Problems of To-
day, from the Point of View of a Psycholo-
gist,” published in 1910. One of her feats
was to cause the controlling spirit, “John,” to
move a table in a cabinet 3ft. behind her
and to play on a guitar while her hands
were being held and her feet were resting
on those of the people who were testing her.
It looked genuine; Munsterberg sat one side
of her and another scientist the other, and
they were in contact with her hands and feet
the whole time. But the wily psychologist
was not satisfied, and he prepared another
test unbeknown to the medium. At the
second performance when the lights were
down a man wormed his way snake-like into
the cabinet. Munsterberg told him to 100k 1
out for wires. Judge of his surprise when
he found that the “controlling spirit” was'
the lady’s leg! She freed her foot from her
shoe (probably the pressure was maintained
by a hook from the other shoe) and with an
athletic backward movement of the leg
reached out and fished with her toes for the
guitar and table in the cabinet. This time
the table, though it scratched the floor a
little, did not move and the guitar did not
play, but instead the medium gave a wild
yelling scream that (Munsterberg says) beat
anything Sara Bernhardt could do even at
her most thrilling moment. The unsuspected
intruder had grasped her foot and held
firmly on to her heel, and she knew that her
trick had been discovered at last.

THE HARPIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A spinster grave is Helen Grey,
She bides at fifty-four,
And seventy is she to-day.
For forty years or more
She’s taught the harp to earn her bread.
The pupils come each morn;
Each afternoon they come. ’Tis said
Her finger-tips are worn
Like things of hardest horn
With harping, and the children cry she is the one
who will not die.
She’s made no neighbors. Tall and white
She goes her even way.
But now and then there was a night
When she might sit to play
At others’ festivals. She gave
The laughing girls no glance,
She had no I 'eyes for striplings brave
Revolving in the dance.
From every dear romance
The strings of harps have bound her feet since she
was eighteen, fair and sweet.
They hear all day her thrumming harp,
And far into the night.
There came a winter grim and sharp.
She withered at its bite.
The pastor went from o’er the way.
When told that she must die.
He said: “My sister dear, for aye
With seraphim on high
A golden harp you’ll ply.”
She shrieked to hear what he had said, and rose up
firmly from her bed!
VICTORIA.

“Duglio”: Heard a ding-dong argument
between a Yank and an Aussie last night. It
was too hot to catch all that was said, but
1 heard the Aussie finish up with, “Strike me
pink, I suppose you’ll be telling a bloke in
a minute that you started the —;— war!”
* * * *
“0.L.”: There are all sorts of ways of
going to war. Lately the Defence Depart-
ment called for men to fill clerical jobs in
the A.I.F. abroad. Candidates for a billet
like this have to undergo an examination for
physical fitness, suitable men to be not far
below the field-standard, if at all below.
For these higli-and-dry little positions, far
from the noise of battle and the dirt and
drudgery of the trenches, there were more
than 1000 applicants.
“L.E.” (from London) :
The trial of Pemberton Billing,‘M.P., charged at
the Old Bailey with publishing a false and defama-
tory libel on Maud Allan, the dancer, who onee
gave an unexciting season in Melbourne, and inci-
dentally on J. T. Grein, dramatic critic, was
the most sensational known in London since
the trial of Oscar Wilde. It was a thriller,
not to say a shocker, a “movie,” with
hysterical witnesses, medical experts, moral indig-
nation, high politics, German gold, corruption in
high society, all mixed up With fruity detail, abuse,
recrimination, advertisement and farcical interludes.
Anybody could be in it, for witnesses shouted out
whatever they liked and names of celebrities went
up like fireworks. Justice Darling was the brightest
spot in the proceedings; his sanity is most refresh-
ing. and he cracks his jokes in fine style. In an Aus-
tralian court most of the company would have been
committed for contempt, but Darling was tolerant,
and made only humorous threats to have some heated
orator removed till he cooled down. Nobody would
have thought that such dire events could spring
from a trivial cause like “Salome,” a play one
supposed dead and buried and deservedly forgotten.
THE WAITER’S ORDER .
“ Well, what can I get you now?”
“Please go and get me a jew minutes to
myself .”
The Victorian chess champion, talking of
the strain which that silent, solemn game im-
poses on the nerves of international-tourna-
ment players, stated that Blackburn, at the
age of 78, is still touring England with his
exhibitions of simultaneous play, though the
old chap no longer engages in tournaments.
It must be the spirit of the showman that
keeps Blackburn going, and his powers of
visual memory must be tvonderfully well
preserved. He was
always more of a
memorist than a
great master strat-
egist at the game.
- The writer has a
40-year-old recollec-
tion of Blackburn
sitting blindfolded
in a corner of a
chess club-room, with
his back turned to
12 , tables where
anxious amateurs
were poring each
over his little board.
T h e y announced
their moves in turn,
and the showman,
in his turn, pictured
each board in his
mind's eye and called
liis move, sometimes
adding “Check!” or
“Checkmate!” or
“Checkmate in next
move,” as the case
might be. Then he
would state how the
death knock was to
be administered.
Once in a way he
would affect to be a
little uncertain about
the position of the
men, and would call
out the particulars
to the best of his
recollection, which
would be perfectly
correct and would
bring a round of
applause. Blackburn
would win, say, 10 of
the games and draw
the other two. Perhaps
the veteran doesn't
tackle more than
six games at once
these times.
“DeVonia”: Though the figures quoted by
“Trot” (B. 4/7/T8) in relation to the
vote at the ballot taken among the textile
workers of Lancashire on the question of
whether the school-age should be raised to
14 are unpleasant, it would be wrong to
suppose that they indicate an intention to
rush the polls as anti-educationists. When
among the Lancashire
the suffragists got busy
lassies every girl left
school at the age of
eleven. After a struggle
the age was raised to 32
and later on to 13. It
is the suffragists who
have done most to push
the present proposal for
an extension to 14 for-
ward, but custom and
ignorance among the
older women are hard to
fight. Among a batch of
women sent to gaol dur-
ing the suffragist rumpus
in London in ’O7 was a
delegate of 17, who re-
presented thousands of
Lancashire work girls
and women. The magis-
trate threw up his hands
in horror at the idea of
“a child of 3.7 coming
to London when she
should be at school.” He
didn’t know that in Lan-
cashire the child-woman
left school at 12, and
next morning at dawn
was off to the mill, re-
turning home at night
through slums of which
the haggard realism would
leave an old hand of 17
mighty, little to learn in London. Educated
suffragists in England work tvith heart and
hand and brain for the mill and pit girls,
and their influence on legislation is seen in
the Education Bill now before the House
of Commons.

It takes an Australian country mayor to
patronise France. Sample from the Nepean
Times (N.S.W.) :
The Mayor said they had met there to show their
appreciation of their brave little ally, France—a
little nation who allowed of no distinction, and who
would do its utmost for the Allies.
Perhaps his Rabbitskin was confusing it
with Monaco.
“Bad Bill”: The “Dinkums” in London
are not satisfied that imitation is the sin-
cerest flattery. It was all right to see the
dinky little girls with Billjim hats who
belonged to a section of the “WAACS. and
we didn't even mind the 'bus girls wearing
'em. It was, however, a bit thick when the
Westminster dustmen wore Australian “lids’
with badges on the side, and it touched the
dizzy limit when the blighted Sinn Feiners
wore the same sort of headgear.
HE PAUSED.
“You've been keeping company with, Annie
now for more than ten years. Don't you
think it's time you married her ?”
“Well, I was thinkin' of aski n’ ’er, when all
of a sudden along comes this war an
set me thinkin’ of enlistin' .”
“E.R.”: The “March to Freedom” sol-
diers were in Grenfell (N S.W.) a week or
so back, and in the afternoon, when
recruiting speeches were
being made by returned
men, a few girls were
carrying rifles on their
shoulders. Going up to
an eligible, they would
ask him to take the
rifle from them. One
sunburnt lass rushed
up to a likely-looking
lad whose hair hung
long and straight at the
back and had burrs and
grass-seeds in it: “Here,”
she challenged, “how
about taking this rifle
from me?” “Garn with
yer,” he drawled, un-
comfortably shifting
from one foot to the
other, “ them's no good
fer shootin’ rabbits !”
* *
A cry from Jericho :—■
It is easily seen that the war is to# far from Aus-
tralia’s shores for her people to realise what a
ghastly thing it is, otherwise they would stick a
large-sized pin in themselves and sit up to take
notice. Australians, by their complacence to Fritz
at large in their midst, appear to think that he is a
harmless individual; but here is a sample of his
little ways when the chance comes to him as told
by a Hun camera. During one of the Light Horse
“stunts” in Palestine, a swell Hun officer was cap-
tured by the Billjims, and swung on his shoulder was
a camera. A half-used film was developed, and this
is what it disclosed. Erected near the wall of an
enemy barracks were five beams, each supported by
uprights about 12ft. high. On these beams were the
bodies of five Armenian men, with a length of. rope
around their necks, the rope being attached to block
and tackle which was used to pull the bodies to ttfe
required height. In front of these bodies that were
suspended in mid-air were a dozen Turkish soldiers
and two Turkish and five Hun officers, all of Whom
specially posed whilst this gruesome affair was photo-
graphed! The Armenians were not hanged by the
sudden-death method ; they were just strangled', and
no doubt the poor beggars must have suffered fright-
fully before the end came. I have a print in front of
me at his moment, and would willingly forward it
but am afraid that one of the “full-backs” at the
base might think he has more right to it than 1
and it is impossible for me to obtain another. This
is what the Huns do to the Armenians, and they may
do the same thing in Australia if we lose the war.
Do you wonder that when we read of Germans in
Australia obtaining special permission to return to
their homes from the internment camps that we get
disgusted with our wooden-headed, weak-kneed Gov-
ernment and Australia in general? If we are
unworthy of reinforcements, surely the country we
are willing to shed our blood for can be kept clean
of those Huns, who are a menace to all we have left
behind.
The Allied (mostly British-Australian)
army has only been in Jerusalem a few
months, but already these “six-bob-a-day
murderers” and hired minions of capitalism,
as the pro-Hun party loves to call them,
have cleaned the city, improved the water-
supply, installed a decent Government under
which trade and industry are prospering, and
supervised the laying- of the foundation-stone
of a university. The Hun hasn’t started
any universities during this war, but he has
burned a few.

“Duglio” : The Aussies were being relieved
by the Tommies, and in the course of taking
over our boss was asked if there was any-
thing else to report. The answer was: “No,
that’s the lot. but if you keep peggin’ away
at ’em like Hell, they won't know we have
gone.”

A complaint by clergymen of the Anglican
Church against the Archbishop of Sydney is
that from Bishop Barker’s time through the
terms of all his successors garden parties
were frequently given at Bishopthorpe, Band-
wick, then the Bishop Palace, to clergymen,
their wives and families. The present bisli.
(who thought the old palace too far away
for “his work,” and got into Tom Mort’s old
home, which is still further away) is appar-
ently not keen on garden parties. This
is a serious matter at a time when the
minds of the faithful are otherwise dis-
tracted. Maybe, his Gaiters can’t afford the
expense. His rake-off is merely £2250 a
year.
* * * *
The suspicion that Uncle Samuel’s air forces
are somewhat behind schedule is shown by
the allotment of an order for 14,000 ’planes
in Europe, and the recent advice to hasten
the production of Liberty motors at home.
The latter engine is being completed at the
rate of 100 a week, but this output isn’t all
that Uncle hopes to do in the airplane-
machinery department, especially as his
European Allies have discovered the virtues
of the Liberty and want as many as Sam can
supply. Recently France lodged a request
for 10,000 to be delivered at the earliest
moment.

“T. 0.1.”: Apropos that 30s. a week
granted by the Australian Government to
two female relatives of the late Archivist
THE COLOR QUESTION.
SHE: “I knew a woman whose hair turned
white in a night.”
HE : “My dear, when a woman’s hair changes
as quickly as that it doesn’t run to
white.”
Petherick (B. l/8/’18), “N or M” . surely
forgets the excellent bargain that Petherick
made for himself. He offered Andrew Fisher,
the Prime Minister, his collection conditionally
on his appointment as Commonwealth Archi-
vist at a salary of £7OO, and so jealous was
he that no one has had a complete survey of
the collection. “The public indifference to
the great gift” means that the public has not
had a chance to thoroughly examine it.
THE WAY OF IT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I will not tease you into vows,
Nor tempt you into jealous rows,
I will not flirt nor frown nor fret,
And ii by chance you should forget
'to call on me some weary week,
I’ll bear it smilingly and meek.
And all the things you wish 111 do;
111 wear a thick-soled, flat-heeled shoe;
I’ll buy the plainest little dresses,
And hats that lure no man's caresses.
Since Modesty's the charm in maid,
My hair must stay its present shade.
My ways I’ll mould on what you teach,
111 never contradict your speech,
But grow a soft mush of concession,
My every glance a love confession—
• And when this path I’ve learned to tread,
Some other girl you'll go and wed!

BARNET GLASS
MOTOR TYRES
Economic Tyre Service depends on three things—the quality of
the material put into the Tyre, the care expended in manufac-
turing it, and most important of all, to make a tyre suitable for
the climatic and road conditions.
A Tyre created under the above methods must necessarily mean
QUALITY —and Quality means more MILEAGE.
This is what we claim for BARNET GLASS TYRES—not an
extravagant claim as thousands of Australians can testify.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Australia House in London, the place
with the marble pillars and the carpet that
weighs a ton, approaches completion. It
is the office of the Great High Ambassador
Fisher, and has cost about £850,000. When
everything is completed—unless the Hun
drops a bomb on it and prevents the com-
pletion—it may cost £1,000,000. This repre-
sents about £50,000 a year at current interest
rates, and with £35,500 for staff and £5OOO
for the Tall Commissioner himself, £91,000
a year will cover the lot until interest goes
up or more staff is required. It was
intended that the six State Agents-General
should rent bits of Australia House, so
that they might share the expense and bring
all the country’s business together, and bor-
row postage-stamps from each other. But
the State Agents-General don’t want to be
mistaken for Fisher’s clerk or ottice-boy, so
they hold aloof. Cheops, who built the big
Pyramid, may have been something of a
fool, but at least his structure didn’t require
a staff at £40,000 a year to keep it going.
There was just one big bill and that was
all. Cheop’s work was permanent, too, and
considering the rich tourists it has attracted
and the stupendous advertisement it has
been, it is probably paying 50 per cent, per
annum on its cost even now. In fact, the
far-seeing old Pharaoh created a sinking
fund. Considering the awful state of Aus-
tralia’s public debt this country might do
well to sell Australia House and build three
pyramids at Alice Springs. They would
attract traffic to the Great Central Railway,
and they might also attract rain.
“Mujik”: N. S. Wales railway men are
bringing forward a resolution at this year’s
Trades Union Congress in favor of “the
apropriation of all incomes in excess of
£lOOO a year to defray portion of the w-ar
debt.” And, in spite of the protests of Fat
at any such proposal as this, the railway
men could produce a whole library of politi-
cal economy to justify it. But there are
two angles to look at theories. One has
reference to their practicability and the
machinery available for translating them
into action ; the other is what they lead
to in a practical way. No\V, according to
Knibbs, there are 11,500 persons in Aus-
tralia having incomes of £lOOO and over,
their aggregate receipts being £27,000,000.
Allowing each £lOOO there would be a sur-
plus of £15,500,000 for appropriation. At
present this £15,500,000 contributes not less
than £4,000,000 by way of State and Fed-
eral income tax, and another £1,000,000 in,
other taxation. So the net gain would be
£10,000,000 —on paper. How many of these
people with excessive incomes—surgeons,
lawyers, politicians, business men, loafers,
grafters and sundries —would continue earn-
ing over £lOOO year for the fun of parting
with it, mostly to pay them interest on war
bonds, which in the circumstances wouldn’t
be worth having on the premises because the
revenue therefrom would never arrive? That
is the test of the project. The hypothetical
arithmetic is up to the railway men. Mean-
while I merely want to observe that they are
barking up the wrong tree. None of them
get over £lOOO a year. Most of them get under
£200; not many over £3OO. If they concen-
trated on keeping the raider’s hand off the
little man the way to deal with corpulent
pockets would seem to be up to someone else.
Joseph Cook has taken to preaching in
England. His colleague Hughes has taken
to Protection and compulsory military ser-
vice. So poor eclipsed .Cook, who hasn’t
Hughes’s graces of oratory and is too angu-
lar of mind to revolve quickly on his politi-
cal axis, resumed his old job to fill in time.
The Queensland Government is circulating
a brochure entitled “Socialism at Work.”
Coming on top of a declared deficit of
£409,000 in the whole of the State’s busi-
nesses, and a loss of £1,078,000 on the Bail-
ways, the pamphlet is just out in the nick
of time to explain how Socialism got into
such bad company.
The Legislative Assembly of S. Aus.,
which got together last week, breaks all its
own records for new blood. This is because
the Labor members who had become
“Nationalist” were mostly put out at the
general election last March by fresh Labor
Candidates. There is not one of the late
Vaughan Government left in Parliament. As
against four Labor supporters last session,
THE WICKED STEPMOTHER.
“The first thing is to win the war. And distracting the people with questions like fiscalism would
give no help in that work even if it did not prove a hindrance.”- I —Sydney D.T.
“Never mind those men, sonny; come and lock at the war news!"
Gunn, the new leader, now has a party of
about 17 in opposition (including Denny, an
ex-Attorney General, whose seat is being
kept for him while he is at the war. An-
other ex-A.G., Jim Vaughan, lost his seat
in his absence). The Labor men are nearly
all new to the House, but there is only one
fresh Nationalist, that’s Blackburn, the
lawyer V.C. Including the seven National-
ists,' and a solitary Farmers’ and Settlers’
member, Peake sits as Premier at the head
of a coalition party of 29, as against 40
before the elections.
Since he became a Liberal or an anti-
Laborite or whatever he is these times Pre-
mier Holman seems to have developed a
fine sense of humor, and appears to have a
particular fondness for exercising it upon
the Sydney Telegraph. That organ having
“swallowed” him naturally enough finds its
stomach out of order, and now is in the
wretched position of not being able to get
rid of the swelling. Holman adopts an
attitude of- patronising levity every time the
Telegraph shakes its gamp. Latterly the
paper has been exhorting the Premier to be-
come economical, which in the circumstances
of the case is about the weirdest counsel the
advocate of Big Sydney and Centralisation
ever proffered. Holman, appreciating the
opening for jocularity, after stapdmg the
scolding for a day or two, solemnly inti-
mated that the time was ripe for it to stop.
“We must be united.” he explained. ‘These
references to economy prejudice recruiting.
Let us combine to win the war.” Then he
sat back and waited —and when the Tel-
egraph solemnly explained that it had been
trying to assist recruiting by advocacy of
keeping a few shillings in the cashbox to go
on with in case the receptacle ran dry before
the war finished, Holman’s laugh was heard
at Alice Springs.
“Peter Pan’s” outcry :
A noisy Parliamentary squabble is about to ensue
in the Vic. Assembly over the distribution of
£1,000,000 of accumulated tramway profits. Public
Works Minister Robinson asserts that the Tramway
Bill must go through unimproved and unaltered.
Cabinet is angling for the Country Party’s votes by
juggling with the million, the object apparently being
to put it into a new account and steer it in the
direction of the Country Roads Board. Meanwhile
Melbourne remains one of the few great cities of
the world with an out-of-date tram service. Owing
to lack of power-house development, when half a
dozen extra cars are hung on the cables at the rush
hours the whole show is not far off a breakdown.
At rush houps it is estimated that about a third of
the fares are never collected owing to the overcrowd-
ing. Some of the spare money should be used to
enable trams to be run all night and all Sunday. At
present the cars do not appear in the city on the
Sabbath till nearly 2 o’clock. As the trains are run,
why not the trams? Melbourne, with 708,000 people,
is suffering from a very badly-congested street
traffic, which the aforesaid million pounds ought to
be used to dissolve. It’s a sporting bet that the
Lawson Cabinet will go to its long home over the
tramway question.
If Noah had been a Freetrader there would
be nothing but fish on the face of the earth
to-day. The flood would have come and
drowned the human race while he was wait-
ing for the importer to supply ark-building
material.
Lancelot Stirling, who was re-elected presi-
dent of S. Aus. Leg. Council the other day,
has been in the chair for 17 years, and claims
the astonishing record of never having missed
a sitting.
“Henry Horsecollar” : Sydney Telegraph
(29/7/’18) wagged the importers’ banner
once more, saying that the tariff should
rather be lowered than raised so that
imports might be increased “with a
view of making the Customs, while
the war lasts, as productive of revenue
as possible.” It seems to me very
costly and stupid and circuitous. As
things stand I have to import and pay for
£lOO worth of anchors from a non-British
country to get a chance of helping the rev-
enue with £lO, and thereby I destroy £lOO
worth of local industry and wages and
intelligence. Now if I assaulted the Sydney
Telegraph editor twice and was fined £5
each time I would Contribute just as much
to the revenue and wouldn’t discourage any
Australian industry, nor would I send £lOO
iu gold out of the country. Last year Aus-
tralia exported nearly £12,000,000 of hard
money to pay for anchors and such-like, and
it would be better to assault 12,000 Free-
trade editors than increase the drain.
“P. Pollard’s’’ bird’s-eye view:—
With a general election tacked on to the end of
the present session the Speck’s Nationalist Govern-
ment is beginning to make a noise about war profits
and food prices. Among other things Ministers say
(1) that the pastoralists are not responsible for the high
price of beef; and (2) that more animals must be
grown to bring the price and supply back to normal.
Meanwhile they are in such a hurry to increase the
animal census that they are keeping almost unin-
habited a 274,364-acre fattening paddock capable of
priming two “stores” to the acre in six months.
This is King Island in Bass Strait. The climate is
always Spring, and drought has never left a visiting-
card thereabouts since Flinders dropped in. Although
a “dependency” of Tasmania two-thirds of the island
belongs to Victorians. Getting in early the main-
landers improved the place by the expenditure of
several hundred thousand pounds. By the Speck’s
laws the speculators can send no cattle to their selec-
tions unless the animals do 90 days’ quarantine in
the Yellow Rock reserve. As this will accommodate
only 50 bovines simultaneously, and the fee is 6d.
each per day, the regulation amounts to exclusion.
A. J. Staughton, who owns a vacant 15,000-acrc
paddock on the island, went over to the Speck with
Sid Kidman last year and tried to get the embargo
lifted, but the local beef barons squealed so loudly
that the Government got scared of losing its job and
chased Staughton and Kidman off the premises. The
possibility of importing pleura 'is the excuse. The
amazing part is that pleura is now almost extinct in
Victoria.
“0.K.” : Last week's reference to the long-
deceased Max Hirsch set hie wondering how
Max would have got on had he been living
in Melbourne to-day. A great battler for
the Kaiser’s cause was brother Max, who
talked like a book with his powerful German
accent on the blessings of Freetrade. He
failed in his own candidature for Parlia-
ment, but he put in some fine work on behalf
of other men standing for constituencies
where the Fritz vote was numerous. Max
was the apostle of cheaper “reabers und
binders.” He would promise bucolic German
meetings, in their native tongue if necessary,
that the election of Mr. Bluff would result in
an early reduction of the duty on reabers
und binders. The Fritz of the period had
faith in the promises of compatriot Max, but
it wasn’t implicit. “If der noo man don’t
pring down der brice of reabers und binders
—veil, oud lie go,” said the stodgy German
farmers. Hirsch must have got a good deal
of Hun money to play with. He was one
of the earliest German missionaries to Vic-
toria, and the fattest foreign-traders, German
and otherwise, mourned the loss of him.
GOOD NEWS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Sir Douglas Haig, in an official message to
America, says that the war’s great crisis is now
past.”— Cable.
Here’s the good Spring, the kind Spring, coming up
the land,
Laughter in its merry wind, blossoms in its hand ;
Throw the happy windows wide, hear the lilting song,
The good Spring, the kind Spring, blustering along.
For the wine of an August morning
Is a great, full draught to drink ;
And the blood in my heart is scorning
The thoughts that July could think.
Oh, the world with its wonderful greens and blues
Is full of good news —good news —good news !
Here’s the rich Spring, the wise Spring, tripping
through the trees,
Calling up the yellow moon from the silver seas.
All the sky’s wide meadows gleam lit with starry
Are;
The brave Spring, the warm Spring, brings our
heart’s desire.
For the wine of an August gloaming
Is a great, full draught to drink;
And the fine long thoughts come homing
That never July could think—
Oh, the night, with its wonderful ways to choose
Is full of good news—-good news—good news !

“Dip Famine
Rumor” Unfounded
Many flock owners may have been scared
because of rumours of a “ Dip Famine ” but
such a possibility is without any foundation.
A shortage of imported dips need have no
effect on dip supplies whatever, for Australia
now produces in
POWDER SHEEP DIP
AN ARSENICAL DIP OF THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE QUALITY
chemically and physically equal to the best dip hitherto imported—and which can be supplied to
meet “ a VaUo** dipped flocks are already speaking eloquently as to the reliability of this compound—•
proving by their wool yield, wool quality and all round improved condition that Vallo Powder
Sheep Dip is not oply effective, but longest lasting in its destructive action against Ticks, Lice, and
all an a^so i u t e preventive of Scab, reduces Fly Strike to a minimum, and
makes sheep impervious to contagion from “ dipping ” to next shearing.
“ Vallo ” Sheep Dip is manufactured in Australia by A. Victor Leggo and Co., who own their
own arsenic mines, and themselves produce and prepare the whole of the ingredients used, thus
guaranteeing the most reliable and economical powder dip on the market.

“The Oldest Inhabitant'’: Mrs. Parker,
probably the oldest resident of the Orange (N.S.W.)
district, has died at the age of 95 years. Which
recalls a Parker of ancient residence whose son
settled in Orange. Josiah Parker was an apothecary
in William-street, Bathurst, as far hack as the mid-
’thirties. Prior to that he carried on business in
West King-street, Sydney. In Bathurst in 1851 his
shop was near the spot where later, and may be
to-day, The First Nugget Inn was kept by John Eyers,
a very wealthy old Bathurstian. John named his
pub from the following incident. In 1851 an aborig-
inal shepherd, in the employ of Dr. Kerr, found on
that gentleman’s run at Mcroo Creek a large parcel
of gold weighing, when clear of quartz, 1061 b. trov.
In raising it out of its bed the mass was broken into
three parts. Dr. Kerr brought the find into Bathurst
iii his gig. That day John Eyers named his pub
The First Nugget.

“X.Y.” : The great obstacle to the satisfac-
tory curing of meat is the presence of a “taint” in
the harness cask. If a cask becomes tainted and is
not thoroughly cleansed it will faithfully transmit
that taint through all successive batches of beef
placed in it. It used to be said that a rum-cask
made the best beef cask ; but the fact is no wine or
spirit cask is suited to the purpose. They have
absorbed ethers or ferments, and affect the beef in a
way quite their own. Kauri pine makes the best of
harness casks. The staves should not be more than
an inch in thickness, and the cask should be pro-
vided with a close-fitting lid. A good handy size is
one which will hold about 4001 b. If beef has decom-
posed in a cask the micro-organisms invade the
timber, and will infect sound
meat subsequently interned.
When this occurred the pro-
cedure used to be to make a
fire of straw or shavings
and place the inverted barrel
over the flame. This pro-
cess, while it did not suc-
ceed in sterilising the bot-
tom of the cask, usually
injured the top by charring
it. A safe and sure way
is to sterilise by steam or
boiling water. Steam is the
best and easiest agent, if
there is a boiler under
pressure anywhere handy.
Place a steam pipe, or hose,
in the cask and cover the
same- with a cornsack.
Half an hour would be suf-
ficient with a small jet of
steam, at low-pressure. An
alternative plan is to parti-
ally fill the cask with boil-
ing water. I once used
another system. Large,
water-worn boulders of
diorite from the river-bed
were piled up with iron-
bark timber, and the heap
ignited beside the cask,
which was about half-filled
with cold water. When
the stones were heated
through they were dropped in as required. This
caused the water to boil furiously. The cask was
then covered with a cornsack and allowed to cool
off.

“H.C.D.”: Sixty expert shearers from the
East are having the time of their lives on the Mur-
chison (W.A.). Motor-cars met them with their
cook on their arrival at the railway terminus, and
first-class accommodation was provided everywhere.
They are being paid 31s. a hundred, and when their
last .shed cuts out cars will be waiting to take
them to the nearest railway station. To see these
knuts of the scissors sleeping in tailor-made pyjamas,
using a toothbrush, having their tan boots cleaned,
and dining with the boss has knocked some of the
old-time local shearers band}..
THE OLD UNNECESSARY QUESTION.
HE: “But, tell me, darling, will you be mine?”
“Kola”: Died the other day, in the River-
ina,Austin Mack, aged 79. He was the man respon-
sible for the rabbit thereabouts. -Iri ’5B he was
working for his uncle, Thos. Austin, at Barwon
Park, Winchelsea, near Geelong (Vic.), who had
.been trying hard to establish rabbits, hare’s, part-
ridges and pheasants, as he wished to make Barwon
Park resemble an English estate. But he had no
luck. After a spell Mack decided to return to the
Cold Country on a visit, and Austin commissioned
him to bring out a few wild cotton-tails. He
brought 88 and some hares. They were ail turned
loose in Barwon Park and started to do the wonder-
ful multiplication sum that will never end. The
mistake first made was in using tame rabbits.
“Bill R.” : If “Wart” (B. 4/7/’18) wants
to bomb out the indiscriminate bird-killer, he ought
to first lob a whiz-bang or two among the pigeon-
shooting clubs, whose adherents are the prime
offenders. The pigeon-murderer gets his practice
by traversing the fields and banging two barrels
at every ground bird that rises before him. Slow
birds and fast fliers alike are welcome, and especially
the quiet homestead birds that give an easy distance
rise. To qualify himself for the slaughter of a
dozen birds or so at the trap, this rotter kills
hundreds afield, and this is done in the name of sport!
“F.H.” : Sheepmen on Victoria’s Western
District have been making lamentation about another
imported horror. This is the ordinary European
brown rat, which is now spreading widely over all
the expensive, fertile acres of the State’s oldest
settlements. The vermin are alleged to burrow like
rabbits into the soft ground, coming out when
opportunity offers to gobble the nearest eatables.
During the last drought, Australia having had
nobody in the Joseph-of-Egypt class to prepare for
the inevitable, thousands of tons of fodder were
imported from the U.S. and elsewhere, and the rats,
it is thought, were carted into the country in this
feed. Thus the importing-maniac, a lot of whom is
living on Vic.’s Western District, is being eaten out
by a friend of the family.
“Wee Bobbie” : In my wanderings in Aus-
tralia I never saw the eaglehawk swoop on to fish,
yet fish is chiefly the prey of the bird here in the
Solomons. He is an adept at catching, even beating
the keen-eyed osprey. I shot a couple of the hawks
lately, and their plumpness in comparison with the
others shot in Australia was remarkable, the Solo-
mon Islanders being much heavier. Their length of
wing from tip to tip was 70in.
“Pick”: It’s true that strychnine has no
apparent effect upon pigs, but I would counsel any-
body but a Hun not to pass up his plate when the
porks comes in. Joe Smith, a Bibbenluke (N.S.W.)
shepherd once converted into bacon a pig that some
time previously had dined off the carcase of a sheep
which had been poisoned for the benefit of crows.
When the doctor was called in he found unmistakable
symptoms of strychnine-poisoning pervading the
Smith household. Subsequent analysis brought to
light traces of poison in the bacon.
QUITE EASY.
MAGINNIS : “And tell me, Casey, how the
devil did you manage to get into a pith?”
CASEY: “Sure, by keeping out of 'em."
“Hawkesbury” : In this district (River-
stone, N.S.W.) we have got rabbit-skins showing on
the inner surface a photograph of another rabbit
erect. In color the photo is that of the doe rabbit
on whose skin it is found. A black sample has been
sent to the Australian Museum, Sydney.

AT THE SIGN OF THE ROTTEN EGG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Rotten Egg is a pub condemned for the sake
of the evils it damned,
And ghosts have haunted its gloomy bar since last
the front door slammed —
Cobwebs and dirt and never a sign of cask or bottle or
keg—•
They are going to build a warehouse soon on the site
of The Rotten Egg.
The landlord’s wife was a portly dame, with a hard,
cold eye on the cash,
But a motherly heart for the down-and-out (though
to answer her back was rash).
The boss was a man with a patch on his eye, one
arm and a wooden leg;
An old Imperial pensioner—he was boss of The
Rotten Egg.
The sign outside was yellow and green and a sort
of a sickly blue,
And more than one of the wrecks inside had a
touch of those colors too.
They were bad eggs all, but they heard the call, and
seven put in the peg;
’Twas a sorrowful day when they marched away from
the sign of The Rotten Egg.
The heart of the city is granite hard and the
weather is cold and damp;
So I camped last night in The Rotten Egg (I had
nowhere else to camp).
With a rusty key and a ragged rug and a flask
that was nearly done,
I laid awake till the Ghosts came in; and L
questioned them, one by one:
“Ghost Number One, with the bandaged brow and
the ugly blotch on your breast,
A pace to the right of the khakied shades and two
in front of the rest.
Why did you die?” And the spectre spoke (a ghost
of the hard-faced dead) :
“1 died that the mother, whose heart I broke, might
hold up her old grey head.”
“Pass friend,” I said; “and I’ll say no more. Now,
speak, Ghost Number Two!”
THE LITTLE MISTAKES OF WAR.
NEW SUB: “What's your battalion, my
man?"
OLD HAND: “78th”
NEW SUB.: “Who's the C.O.?”
OLD HAND: “I am.”
“I died for a dream,” the Shade replied ; “and they
say that my dream came true.
Here with a pal and a pot of beer and brooding on
bygone Springs,
I was a drunkard down and out, who dreamed heroic
things.”
“Pass friend!” I cried, “I have had that dream.
Now, speak, Ghost Number Three!” '
“I was a writer who could not live on a writer's
wretched fee.
I died for the sake of a bit of land, with a two-
roomed house and a shed,
IV here the wife and chicks might live at peace from
the rent when I was dead.”
“Pass friend!” I said. “Let those who can and the
others who may forgive.
1 died a death—though another death—that the" wife
and kids might live.
Shall the rentlords die, or their victims die for
the things we still deplore?
Shall the poet or drunkard’s dream come true? Speak
now, Ghost Number Four.”
*
‘No matter my class,” said Number Four; “no
job I followed nor trade.
I died for the sake of the work I’d done; for the
sake of the name I’d made.
I died unknown and I died alone ; and I think that
the death was grand;
A lumper of bombs and the mess-kid scut —a runner
to No Man’s Land.”
T woke; and a beam from the rising sun streamed
in through a broken pane
And gilded a patch on the plastered wall where the
pencilled names were plain—
A sketch of a man with a patch on his eve, one
arm, and a wooden leg—
’Twas the Roll of Honor we wrote the night they
shut up The Rotten Egg.

Stmafib Phonograph
Many people never thought of buying a
Phonograph till they saw the Stew ait.
They knew that a first-class machine cost
a lot of money —more than they could
afford, or cared to pay—and that while
there were some machines low in pi ice
they were likewise low in quality.
Hence Phonographs did not interest them
very much.
It remained for the Stewart to gain their
serious attention. This little Phonograph
made an irresistible appeal to them. It
was unlike any other talking machine they
had seen, and yet, somehow or other, it
seemed to give as good results as the big,
expensive machines.
They studied the Stewart and found it ah
that the makers claimed for it.
Its powerful worm-drive motor ran
smoothly and silently, and with one
winding would play a standard 12-inch
record.
Its tone was first-class, its reproduction
accurate and lifelike. In design it was
neat and attractive.
It was a handy, convenient sort of Phono-
graph, too. You could put it on a chan,
table or box; take into the dining-room
at meat-time, or out on to the verandah.
If you were going out in the motor-car 01
launch the Stewart could go along with •
you.
Then, too, it was a universal Phonograph
—it would play all types of disc records
any make, any size, any price.
1500 Stewart Phonographs were sold in
Australia during the past six months, and
part of that time machines were unobtain-
able owing to the war.

local Music Store or Talking Machine Dealer, write for illustrated pamphlet to any one of the Wholesale Distributors

PRESENCE OF MIND.
MRS. GAYDOG: “Did I hear you speaking of me to that minx as ‘she'?"
MR. GAYDOG : “Certainly, my dear, certainly. Expression of respect, my dear. ‘SHE,’ you
know—short for ‘she who must he obeyed.’”
“Lantana”: The heaviest bullock “off
grass” ever killed in Australia (and probably in the
world) was bred on Monkira station, Western Queens-
land, by Smith, Debney and Co. The live weight
was 30421 b. ; dressed, 22021 b. Monkira station is on
the Diamantina, 270 miles south from Winton, which
is 370 miles from the Townsville meat works.,
“O’Phimerty” : The Rev. Lawrence Tatt’s
parish consisted of three widely-spaced townships
and a large triangle of half-cleared land on which
lived some half-cleared parishioners. Dad Trenton
was the wildest, in a social sense. Dad’s religious
ideas were extremely hazy and his moral notions
were ramshackle. He was always glad to have a
yarn with the parson about the weather, the potatoes
and similar topics, but when the sky-pilot discussed
religion Dad smoked and looked at the distant hills.
Dad lived with his two daughters, his son-in-law and
two grandchildren, a girl of 18 and a boy of 16.
Their manner of life was primitive. The hut that
was their headquarters had one room only, with a
kitchen at the back. In the middle of the room
was a table at which the meals were eaten; and at
either end was a group of rough beds. The women
slept at one end, the men at the other. When the
Rev. Lawrence became aware of this arrangement, his
soul was troubled within him, and he felt that it
was his duty to point out to Dad the irregularity of
the sexes occupying the same sleeping apartment.
“It’s —er —an unusual —er—-way of living, you have,
Mr. Trentop,” he said. Dad slowly emitted three
clouds of vilely-smelling tobacco smoke, withdrew
his pipe from his mouth, and looked at the parson
in the manner of one who awaits further information.
A bead of perspiration broke out on the holy man’s
brow, but he went on pluekily. “I mean boys and
girls sleeping in the same room. You really should
partition the room.” Dad took another long pull
at his pipe. “Never thought of it,” he said laconi-
cally ; “but I’ll tell you what I’ll do, Mister; I’ll
think it over and speak to the girls about ft, and
let you know next time you come.” The Rev. Law-
rence went home feeling that at all events some-
thing had been attempted. About a month later the
parson rode out again. Dad met him a few yards
from the door, full of information and enthusiasm.
“I thought that there matter of the partition out,”
he said. “The girls' reckoned it ought to be done,
so I done it. It’s up now. Come in and see it.”
The churchman stepped in eagerly. “Good Lord 1”
he groaned. The partition was wire-netting.
“Mac Gamba”: The usual crowd was in
train for a country race-meeting. The conversa-
tion drifted to gout and several “sure cures” were
given. Then the bloke with the off-srde moustache
who had listened for 25 miles, piped ,up. “Gout; I
can cure it with kerosene. I cured a fistula on a
flamin’ horse with kero.”
'** * *
“A Soldier’s Wife”: A word or two to
“Assistant Billjim,” who asks how to keep his
kookaburra alive if he takes him abroad. I had
one of the birds as a pet from two days after his
birth until he was two and a half years old. Fed
him mostly with cooked meat (he wouldn’t touch
raw) and occasionally white “woolly” grubs. His
favorite morsel was a locust. One morning he took
a series of fits and in a few days he died. The “dis-
penser” at the Zoo told me I could have kept him
his full span of years by ~ occasionally giving him
mice or rats. The skin of these animals acts as
medicine. Laughing Jack Cannot live long without it.
“Jaymac”: It was late when I arrived at
Lightning Creek, and I went straight to bed without
even asking the publican who my room-mate was,
He arrived later, carrying some whisky internally
and a lamp externally, which he brandished at an
angle of 45 degrees. After some hard thinking he
placed the lamp on the dressing-table, and took his
boots off. Then advancing cautiously to the table
he picked up the alarm-clock and solemnly blew it
out and felt his way back to bed in the apparent
darkness. I doused the glim, and we both passed
an easy night.
* * * *
“Eddyson”: Bell and Wheatfield were
mates working a claim in the shallow alluvial at
Old Crowbar. They were on to a moderately good
thing and naturally eager to tear out as much dirt
as possible for the fortnightly wash; consequently
when they butted right into the deep shaft, the
property of the Claimant Quartz Mining' Company,
the temptation to knock out a couple of slabs and
use the shaft for stowage was not to be resisted.
The Claimant Co. had gone out of action for the
time being, but there were always fond hopes of a
renewal of activities and further developments at
greater depths that would uncover stone matted with
gold and fill shareholders’ coffers and cooking utensils
with spoil. Meanwhile local holders of Claimant
stock were keeping an eye on the company’s property,
but that eye did not penetrate to a depth of 30ft.,
where Wheatfield and Bell had effected a break, and
were pouring into the shaft all their surplus reef,
thereby saving the necessity of hauling to the surface
a large quantity of waste product. The story now
jumps a space of 17 years, and Wheatfield is a miner
in the employ of the Flat Iron Gold Mining Co., No
Liability, working the reef at Crowbar. The Flat
Iron incorporated part of the old Claimant lease,
and was nourishing itself as best it could on 4-weight
stuff in the hope of making 4oz. stone one of
those days. Then came the smash which wrecked the
ambition of Crowbar, and left the Flat Iron Co.
crushed and demoralised. One night, in the course
of the four o’clock shift, the roof of a drive and a
whole stope came in, covering three truckers aud
four facemen. It was thought that there was
just a faint hope for the latter, and the rescue
work had begun at a fearful bat, when an old miner
remembered that in an abandoned cross-cut his pick
had gone through into old Claimant workings. A
party was organised, a windlass was rushed over the
Claimant shaft, and three men went down. They
found, as they expected, the shaft as dry as a bone,
but (what they had not expected) choked with loose
reef to far above the drive. It was still held, how-
ever, that this was the quickest way to the entombed
men, and working like fiends a dozen men got the
mullock up and eventually wound their way into the
Claimant drive. Here, lying face downward on the
reef that had run into the choked drive, they found
the corpse of the only man who had escaped from
the Flat Iron. He had beaten through and made his
way to the shaft only to find it blocked, and he had
died on the barrier set up by his own hands 17 years
earlier. The body was Ephraim Wheatfield.

“Lilly Bluegunv’: I nominate these for
the two best husbands in Australia. Jackson lived
two miles out of town one way, and Johnson lived
two miles out of town the other way. One day they
met at the store. “I’ve been talkin’ to the missus
about that bay mare of yours,” said Jackson. “I
want to know if you’ll sell it and how much you
want for her?” Johnson scratched his head. “Well,
I dunno,” he said doubtfully. “I’ll see what the
wife says about it, an’ let you know.” A fortnight
later the men met again. “About that mare of
mine,” Johnson remarked. “We’v£ decided to let
you have her for a tenner.” “Righto. I’ll see what
the missus thinks of the price,” answered Jackson.
A few days later he stopped Johnson, and said, “I’ll
take the mare. Me an’ the missus will drive out
for it next Thursday.” Johnson stared at the ground.
“Thursday,” he muttered. “I think that’s the wife’s
washin’ day. Anyhow I’ll tell her an’ see what
day’ll suit her best. I’ll send one of the kids to let
you know.” When I last saw the Jacksons they
were pullipg out their sulky, so I suppose that every-
thing was fixed up.
* * *. *
“Gouger”: Underground on the opal-fields
at a depth of over 100 ft. through solid sandstone
I’ve dug out mussel-shells perfectly opalised.. I’ve
seen small fish a glittering, flash of red, green and
yellow, even the scales being perfectly opalised. In
the same way the bones of queer animals are found
embedded in the rock, some with immature opal
colors mixed with the fossilised bone, others with the
bone completely turned to opal. One perfect little
skeleton of a long-extinct marsupial, partly opal-
ised, was bought for a private museum. These relics
are .-valuable mostly as mementoes of a long dead
past, but a few of them are also valuable for the
opal tljey contain.
“Werrimee”: Harry Geriarty, ox-pilot,
recently found one of his leaders at the bottom of
an old 30ft. shaft on the Neardie antimony field
(Q.). He didn’t bother about such things as ropes
and blocking'-tackle. He got a pick and shovel, and
carefully broke and shovelled earth down into the
shaft. The .bullock gradually rose, and finally
walked out, looking very much annoyed at having
so much dust thrown in his eyes.

E.S.S.”: The correa flower (B.
27/6/’18) is commonly known as “correa bells.”
They are red and green and bloom in August. I
don’t know the botanical name, but anxious inquirers
will find some-particulars in Amy Mack’s “A Bush
Calendar.” If you want a hardy Australian flower
that is showy, novel and long-blooming, I can recom-
mend the honey-flower (Lambertia formosa). It is a
thick shrub, with spiky leaves and grows to 6ft.
high. At Undercliff, Sydney, it is very plentiful.
The flower is red and in form resembles a cube of
deep honeycomb.

“Ida D.”: I lately brought two ponies
from a distant part of the district. One of them
has struck up a friendship with my draught, a huge
fellow 17 hands high and with feet like milk-dishes.
The wee Timor can quite easily walk underneath
him. They are a quaint pair. In the paddocks the
two mates are never apart, feeding nose by nose and
always at a distance from the other horses. The
pony has quite given his- little mare the go-by.

A PURGATORY OF WHISKERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My solemn curse on whiskers. Five fierce days
My hedgehog jaws have known no razor’s edge.
My chin is as a hill of cow-trod sedge;
My cheeks a he'dge of bramble-prickles raise.
' Strange and unclean I feel from brow to coat
Since that sure-handed surgeon cut my throat.
It needed cutting; but he left a hole,
A little hole where cold could enter in;
And I to guard that spot from further sin
Must wear this hairy torment on my soul.
In fact, to keep the bandage still in place,
I only wash three-quarters of my face.
Holy is dirt. But saints in olden days
Who added hair shirts to their native fur,
Whose days and dreams were swathed in Bathurst
burr,
Took a rough way to win the heavenly praise.
If any of them felt as I do now
He richly earned that halo for his brow.
Heroes, deep lathered in the Flanders mud,
Have suffered vastly for the Allied cause;
But in the quiet of the battle’s pause
There still is happy soap to make a sud.
Free from these wild jaw-weeds that round me wave,
Like them, to-morrow I shall bathe and shave.

“75” : The Argus is to lose another old-
established member of its literary stall in
Paul Cheyne, who is giving up the job ot
police roundsman and going to Tassy to
become chief-of-stalf of The World, the
voice of local official Labor. In the long-ago
Cheyne was a facile short-storyist. Several
of his yarns appeared in The Bulletin.
At the annual meeting of the Society of
Authors in London Israel Zangwill and
Bernard Shaw indulged in violent and abu-
sive language. The former called Itudyard
Kipling a “literary Esau,” also “a wild ass
of a man,” and castigated the committee for
pocketing what Zangwill called an insulting-
letter from him “even though accompanied
with a cheque for £100,” Shaw inquired
whether any other author was ready to in-
sult the committee with a rude letter
weighted with a cheque for £lOO. He pro-
ceeded to denounce the official controllers of
printing paper, who, he said, were “practical
business men, a familiar phrase that meant
totally illiterate persons quite unconscious of
any intellectual life or activity in the com-
munity.” Valuable works, according to
Shaw, are falling out of print, because no
paper is available for reprinting them,
although for other purposes there appeared
to be an unlimited supply. He declared that
one of his own works, “of the greatest value
to the public at the present time,” was being
ruthlessly barred from reprinting by the
arrogant and ignorant dictators of the paper
supplies. There’ll be another Revolution in
England yet!
Adelaide’s two afternoon papers, the
Journal (which consists half of what the
Register contained in the morning and half
of what it will contain to-morrow morning)
and the Express (which holds the same
position in regard to the Advertiser), came
to a friendly arrangement and reduced them-
selves last week to a single sheet of two
pages. The Herald, the other Adelaide daily,
lias no afternoon edition, and there is no
independent evening paper, except on Satur-
days.
A Satchel of Books
Poems, bv Archibald Strong (James Ingram and
Son, Melbourne). A book of careful and thoughtful
verse which neither adds to‘nor lakes awaj from the
author’s repute. Archibald Strong' delights in the
sonnet and handles it with some dexterity; and the
rather cramped form of the ballade also appeals to
his scholarly mind. Generally speaking, his work
is simple, with a certain Sweetness and smoothness
of rhythm which makes easy reading, lie has good
feeling for words ; but of the emotion which should
give verse its excuse for existence there is a singular
lack. Except for a fine phrase here and there there
is nothing in the book which greatly matters; but,
at the same time, there is nothing to jar or irritate,
as in the works of plain Bill Shakspeare or much-
embroidered Swinburne. A cold book, placid as a
winter pool, and with some of its grey shine.
Art, in Australia (fourth number).- If it had
not already made a high place _ for itself.
Art in Australia, with its present issue, would
arrest attention. It is a permanent and delightful
record of the recent Loan Exhibition of Australian
pictures covering the past 25 years, arranged by
G. V. F. Mann, Director of N. S. Wales National Gal-
lery. Out of the mass of material the editors
selected 37 woi*ks for reproduction, and the printer
and block-makers, as usual, made a fine job of what
was required of them. The review of the exhibition,
by Lionel Lindsay, has been done with characteristic
ability, though it must have been difficult for a
contemporary so well-informed to condense his re-
marks to 2000 words. The historical article scin-
tillates with interest, and should be valuable to
Australian art commentators of the future, as it
accurately places the names and periods that are
the stepping-stones to the position where Australian
art rests now. The book is priced at 7s. Gd., but its
value to the art lover is more than can be judged
from a cash standard. Regarded merely as book-
buving' speculation, the A. in A. publications are
worth while. But let the commercially-minded
be careful. There is always the danger that associa-
tion with tin' gamble will convert the speculator
and make a library miser of him.
Great-heart, by Ethel M. Dell (T. Fisher Unwin,
London). A readable novel by a writer who has
plenty of admirers.
HIS WORKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
For close on four-ancl-thirty years
At books and stories Barder wrote.
With patient zeal and endless cares.
His offerings of verse he brought,
And laid them at the royal feet
Of Demos. Demos thought them neat
On rare occasions. Still to treat
Intricately with purring herds
Of vital words
He bode the waking of the birds.
He wrote a monumental stack
Of stories as the years stole by ;
His labors as a weekly hack
Meant paragraphs to blot the sky ;
And tripping rhymelets, grave and gay,
Dripped from his pen, a yard a day.
Whatever other men might say
To him they were, supremely fine.
“This work of mine,”
Said he, “has e’er the touch divine!”
When looking back he saw a sweep
Of printed matter stretching wide
To far horizon, six feet deep,
And felt a great creator’s pride.
But, in those moments when the hand
Pen-weary fell, his cottage land
He tilled for pastime. From the sand
Coaxed vegetables scant, and drew.
A vine or two,
Of common fruits a Stunted few.
He summed his art accomplishment:
“My,works,” he said, “are all my pride’;
Then felt his powet and spirit spent,
And leaned upon his desk and died.
He up for judgment swiftly spun,
The angel viewed what he had done,
And said: “Go give this little one
Some small reward for two fig-trees,
Few beans and peas,
And cabbages, and works like these!”
VICTORIA.
EDDYSON.
Business, Bobbery, etc.
As a rule, it is best to go the whole hog.
Still, half a pig is better than no swine at
all. Seeing that the demand for ‘ total Pro-
hibition during the war” isn’t getting on very
fast, how about breaking the news gently by
trying total Prohibition of imported drinks
during the war? It would save shipping
space. It would prevent our poor deluded
brother llun making a worse beast of himself
than he is at our expense when lie captures
our ships, laden with cocktails and Old Tom.
And the increased excise revenue would help
to make up for lost Customs duties.
,** * *
Concerning copra:—
A Solomon Islands correspondent told The Bul-
lktix (25/7/’18) how the small copra traders and
settlers have been “severely hit by the war ’ and
how they are being “steadily squeezed in the
economic vycc,” costs having* almost doubled while
they are getting less than the pre-war price for
their product. Burns, Philp and Co., who do a
considerable proportion of the Solomons trade,
forward a statement in which they point out that
the unhappy position of the copra producer is due
entirely to the- state of the overseas markets and
abnormal trading conditions. As for copra fetch-
ing £BO to £lOO a ton in the U.S.A., while the
average price paid to the planter averaged only £lB
last year, 8.-P. state that their 1 shipments to
America have realised less than half these fancy
prices. In fact, the U.S.A. copra market has been
depressed owing to (1) large supplies having been
received from Manila, Celebes and the Dutch East
Indies (the Pacific produces less than one-tentli of
the world’s output) ; (2) large stocks, thrown on the
market which were originally consigned for France ;
(3) the offering of large quantities from Ceylon,
Singapore and Manila at reduced prices—2o p.c.
to 40 p.c. less than the price of the South Seas
product handled by 8.-P. The trad? is now further
affected by the U.S.A. restricting shipping for carry-
ing copra. “Since the war commenced,” say 8.-P.,
“we have had the greatest difficulty imaginable in
securing an outlet for South Sea copra, and it has
only been possible by chartering American lumber
schooners.* Were it not for the fact that the adverse
conditions were being met with indomitable pei-
sistence there would be no market at all.” As it is,
the co. is carrying unsold stocks worth a quarter
of a million. For the current year the co. has
about 50,000 tons offering, but as there is little
likelihood of being able to export more than a very
small proportion, the co. will have to restrict buying.
As a result of the abnormal conditions the Sydney
market has been feeling very sick, and quotations
for sun-dried copra fell from £25 per ton to £2o
at the end of May, and to £2l at the beginning of
last month. By the way, though 8.-P. do practi-
cally the whole of the Solomons carrying trade,
the planters are free to dispose of their produce
through any of the score Of other Sydney firms
handling the stuff. Everything considered, the out-
look for the South Seas trader is certainly cheerless.

“W.” : Once more Australia’s win-the-war
Government comes clown on the unfortunate
rabbiter. After removing for a brief space
the embargo on the free and unrestricted
sale of skins the product is “requisitioned” at
about half the market price. When Such
great care is taken not to requisition the
output of very much larver people in the
commercial world at less than market rates,
the question that naturally arises is why
should the rabbiter be selected to practically
contribute half of his possible income to the
war, in addition to what he bears in regard
to ordinary taxation? The trapper works
hard, about six times as hard as half the
city workers, does much good to the country
by'helping to keep in check a dangerous pest,
relieves the labor market, and, incident-
ally, does much good to the Backbloeks by
making and spending his money there, in-
stead of assisting to congest the cities, let,
in spite of the fact that, as with everyone
else, his living and other expenses have
greatly increased (traps, for instance, that
used to be 7s. or Ss. being now 275.. and
strychnine 21s. instead of its former price of
2s. 6d.), the Government seems to think
that half the ruling price of skins is good
enough for him. Yet, for the public to pay
famine prices for leather when the tanners
say there is a glutted supply of the article
on hand is apparently fit and proper!

“R.8.T.”: The Hun naval officer isn’t
too proud to help boost the Fatherland’s
trade. A year or so before the war 1
travelled in the same cabin from Sydney to
Melbourne with an officer of the now-
vanished cruiser Scharnhorst. Found him
a pleasant chap, and rather admired his
patriotism. His particular brand of hair-oil,
bearing a jaw-dislocating name, aroused my
mild interest. Next time I visited the cabin
I found the detached label awaiting me m
an envelope.
* * * *
“Te Babarantiko”: Charters Towers
(N.Q.) is rapidly melting and on present
indications there will soon be no Towers
loft. Houses are continually being taken
asunder, hauled to Townsville and re-
erected, some of them so ancient that much
of the timber resembles a sponge. The allot-
ment is usually thrown in with the houses
to escape the rates, but no building block
has so far been dug up and carted to Towns-
ville. A good deal of second-hand galvamsed-
iron has come from distant Darwin, where
houses are as good as given away. Only
the roofing iron is as yet considered worth
removing. Carpenters’ wages run __ to 20s.
per dav, brickies from 225. to 255.; but
Townsville has mighty little for them to do.
* * * *
“Counter” : The wonderful uniformity in the
price of olive-oil has set me thinking deeply.
Recently I asked in Sydney for the wholesale
charge for the Australian brand, and was
quoted 455. a gallon, which is only about
1000 per cent, above pre-war prices. Think-
ing I would get it cheaper in South Aus.,
where the oil is grown, I inquired at Adel-
aide, but got the same quote. 455. Curiously
enough the price for the imported oil is also
455. a gallon. But you never hear the
Argus denouncing this as a bit of “the pi ice-
fixing farce” about which it has waxed hot in
recent weeks ; the Tory sheet would probably
call it “a general adjustment of prices made
nef .p SS ary by the heavier working costs ufidei
war conditions.”

ous trade sign of Giovanni Spicane, who is
catering for British custom in Malta: —

A Richmond (Vic.) draper was lately
fined £5 for having sold certain cotton
articles which were labelled “merino.” The
shams came originally from Japan, and were
passed on to the draper from a wholesale
house as merino. “It was a custom of the
trade to describe cotton goods as merino,”
so it was explained. Some day a cheeky
counterfeiter will assure the Court that it
is a custom of his trade to regard forged
notes as genuine. But counterfeiters haven’t
got the nerve of importers yet.
* * * *
“F.N.T.”: The retail price of firewood in
Melbourne is now up to Is. lOd. per cwt.
for “split box blocks.” Black coal is only
3d. a cwt more. Considering that the State
owns most of the raw material, as well as
the means of transport, it seems strange
that the Government. doesn’t wade in and
grab some of the easy money growing on
its own lands for the benefit of profit-
mongers. (P.S.: Kindly print “profit-mon-
gers” in a whisper—the Government doesn’t
like to hear the word.)
* * * *
“Kay Ken” : I was looking for a house
to rent, and after a weary search struck a
likely looking place. Went round to inter-
view' the owner, and found him to be one
of those clerical cranks who have the birth-
rate bee in their bonnets. We discussed
terms and everything was going smoothly
until he asked me if I had any children. I
owned to two small ones, and expected the
population zealot to knock a couple of shil-
lings off the rent. Instead, the negotiations
commenced to show signs of frostbite. I ex-
plained that the kids would not practise
black-and-white drawing on the walls, nor
dig trenches in the asphalted back yard, nor
chop down the rose-bushes, but my observa-
tions, like the mustard seed, fell on stony
ground. The liar recollected suddenly that
his wife had promised to let the place to
some previous applicant, and I had to con-
tinue my search until I found a dinkum Aus-
tralian landlord (there are a few about)
who would suffer little children to come
unto his shelter. A couple of dajs
later I saw by our suburban rag that the
holy hypocrite had been wailing some more
about the birthrate at a Dismal Sunday
afternoon.
* * * *
“Le Noy” : I desire to shake the hand of
our friend from Nippon most cordially. For
some time past Japanese carbide has held the
market in northern Bananaland cities.
Agents will quote nothing else, maybe
because there is no other brand .on the
market. What moves me to cordiality is
this. I had occasion to fill three charges tor
an acetylene gas-generator, and as an im-
portant function was on I relied on the
charges lasting out the evening. To my sur-
prise the lights went off an hour before the
show was ended. Cursing into the darkness
I hurriedly inserted another charge, and pro-
ceeded to make an examination of the used
tins. In the first I found a heavy piece of
iron; in the second, three pieces of copper
ore (low grade) ; and in the third, the butt
ends of two broken bottles intermixed with
the carbide imported from our friendly ally.
Is there no Australian carbide?

Samuel B. Moomaw? representing the
Bureau of Markets run by the IJ.S. Dept,
of Agriculture, is one of the live men who
is being sent over to look into the live-stock
industry' and other rural habits of Australia
and tell the U'.S. all about ’em. He reckons
that if ever peace comes again Australian
wool and likely meat and butter and other
products will get the glad hand from Uncle
Sam. Which will be great—especially about
the wool. If Sam takes our wool and makes
it into cloth for us, it won’t cost nearly so
much in freight to haul it back as it would
if we sent it to England or Germany or
somewhere else where they go in for that
sort of thing.
* * * *
“Canberra. Work at a Standstill,’ was
the title of a recent S. M. Herald item re
the capital of this continent. Naturally.
When the town-planners lay out a new city
which has advantages for manufactures, min-
ing or commerce, or which is even a big rail-
way junction, people go to it, and attend to
the building of the place at their own ex-
pense, and even pay taxes and ground-rents
for the privilege of doing so. When it has
no such advantages nobody goes there except
paid officials, and they have to be brought in
a wheelbarrow at the public cost. Now the
wheel, which was loan money, has come on
the barrow.
* * * *
“0.L.”: There are still a few patriots
prepared to do their bit of profit-making at
the expense of the soldiers’ _ funds. A horse
was lately given to a society engaged in
raising cash for Billjim’s benefit, to be raffled.
A kindly soul offered to graze the prad while
the tickets were being sold, but when the
time came for handing over the P. 1 ' 1 ? 6^ 0 ,,.
winner, the sport who had supplied Dobbin
with his bit of grass came forward with an
agistment-bill for several pounds and refused
to give up the nag until the money was paid.
* * * *
“Bill Bowyang”: Some months back the
Italian match export-trade to Egypt became
the property of a combine, and the price o
an ordinary box of wooden lucifers soared
higher than ever before. Someone in Gairo
then decided to start a match-factory, and
there were plenty of offers of financial assist-
ance to put the project on a solid footing.
But here our old friend Nippon stepped in.
During the past few weeks he has flooded tne
land with lights, and so great has been th
fall in xirices that the proposed factory is
now as dead as Pharaoh’s washerwoman, .six
months back it was also proposed to erect a
paper-mill in Alexandria, aDd just when
things were getting a move on the Jap again
hopped in, and the price of paper fell wallop.

Georges Ohnet, the French dramatist who
died the other month, was one-time a
familiar name on English playbills. Several
of his highly-respeetable dramas were trans-
lated, and one of them, “Le Maitre de
Forges,” made a great success in Britain as
“The Ironmaster.” Pinero adapted it for the
Kendals, and in Australia it was played by
Bland Holt. It was a “classy” story rather
than a democratic lesson. The strongest
play dealing with ironworks and workers
that Australia ever saw was “The Lost
Paradise,” translated from the German. This
was produced by J.C.W. at Melbourne Prin-
cess's, but the stage-manager had so cut it
about that it pleased nobody 27 years ago.
SOME SENSE OF PROPORTION.
STAGE-MANAGER: “Here, what are you doing
with that paint? Do you want to get
it all over those girls’ costumes?”
PAINTER: “Talk sense, guv’nor! If that was
all I wanted to do what would I bring a
tig pot like this down for?”
Lionel Belmore, who is still coming
between Guy Post and his dope at
the Sydney Palace, claims to owe his long
association with Henry Irving to the emo-
tional vagaries of Lily Langtry. Lily en-
gaged Belmore for a job in her company,
but threw up her tour. Belmore snatched
a small part in Irving’s co. lie gradually
soared in Henry’s estimation and finished
up as stage manager and confidential guide.
He alleges that in his later years Irving
always invited him home for special con-
sultations when a new piece was being pro-
jected.
William Cromwell, a favorite with the
Meynell and Gunn Musical Comedy Co. until
his methods (like those of most comedians)
became monotonous, has a good part in
"Violette,” a new comic opera that has
London by the ears.
Melbourne has almost forgotten Beatrice
Miranda, who, like her elder sister Lalla,
learned singing from her widowed mother,
now deceased. Lalla went to Europe and
made a grand-opera position for herself
long before she joined the Quinlan co., with
whom she came back to her native land
the year before the war. Beatrice was a
handsome, dashing young woman with
aspirations. She made one or two appear-
ances in Melbourne before going abroad,
and then Australia heard nothing of her for
years. She is now attached to a Carl Rosa
co. that sang through a season at the Lon-
don Shaftesbury lately. She got the part
of Nedda in “Pagliacci,” and was said to
do it with “grace grid vocal skill.” Which
hardly suggests that her voice is great
goods.
“S.”: They are all alike. I was in com-
pany with a fine young actor who was only
twenty 84 years ago, and we were inspect-
ing tile remains of a once very popular
waxworks gathering when we came upon
a rigid impersonation of King Henry VIII.,
who was utilised to point a moral re the
inadvisability of intemperance in matrimony.
Haresfoot looked him over with marked dis-
dain, sampled the side elevation, and said
“Pooh!” completed the circle, and delivered
judgment. “Rottan !” he said. “You should
have seen me as Henry V.” Which reminds
me that when Maurice, the poddy little
Frenchman, was playing Jules Verne stuff
at Melbourne Royal, one of the smart
young men of the co., on going into the
dressing-room, found a ridiculous wax figure
propped in a corner. “What’s this?” he
demanded. “What oet ees?” snorted Mau-
rice. “What you tink? He ees your under-
study, you tarn fool!”
“T. 0.1.”: Recently got two photographs in
splendid preservation of Henry Squires, the
silvery tenor of Lyster’s opera troupe of 1861.
Squires was husband of the prima donna,
Madame Lucy Escott. whose correct name
was said to be Lucy E. Scott. One of the
photos shows Squires in “Martha” and it
brought back a memory of a night in the old
Theatre Royal, Mel-
bourne, in June, ISGI.
Soon after the arrival
of the company, which
consisted of W. S.
Lyster, his brother
Fred, Henry Squires
and three ladies—
Madame Escott, Miss
Georgia Hodson (Mrs.
W. S. Lyster) and
Miss Rosalie Durand
(Mrs. Fred Lyster),
Henry Squires wrote
a letter to a San Fran-
cisco friend in which
he said: “I like this
shore. Melbourne is
a fine city, but every-
thing and everybody
are blawsted English.”
The friend sent ex-
tracts from the letter
to the San Francisco
Call, and these were
copied into Melbourne
papers, whereupon a
section of the public
became highly indig-
nant that a mere itin-
erant opera singer
should so contemptu-
ously dub the citizens.
The company was
then singing in Ad-
elaide, and threaten-
ings not loud but deep
■were heard as to what
would hgppen to
Squires when he made
his reappearance in
Melbourne. “Martha”
was the opera chosen
for the opening night
of the second season. The house was crowded
from floor to ceiling. I had a seat in the
centre of the stalls, where I had a full view
of the auditorium. The opening scenes were
listened to with impatience, but when Lionel
(Squires) appeared, the house rose at him.
Pit, stalls, upper circle and gallery hissed,
hooted, groaned and interjected. The dress-
circle was on the side of the singer,
the ladies waved their handkerchiefs,
the gentlemen split their kid gloves in ap-
plauding. In moments of pause of the
uproar Squires would essay to speak, but
the attempt caused a fresh outburst. Squires
stood his ground manfully, well backed up
by Farquharson, basso and great favorite,
who placed his right hand on the
shoulder of Squires and made a mute appeal
which had some effect. Squires was
heard to say that what he had written
was really intended as a compliment. This
appeared 'to be adding insult to injury, and
the uproar commenced afresh. Farquharson
gave some advice, a signal was made to*
the orchestra, and Squires commenced to
sing “The Last Rose of Summer.” The
first verse was sung amidst a fearful din.
The singer was in splendid voice and gradu-
ally a hush came over the great audience,
and he was permitted to finish the ballad.
The audience rose with great applause.
Squires had made his peace and he heard
nothing more, at least in Melbourne, about
his “blawsted English.”
Beecham’s Opera. Co., touring England, has
acquired Clytie Hine, the Adelaide singer.
Writing home lately, she said that she had
within a week sung in “Carmen,” “Caval-
leria.” “Figaro” and “The Magic Flute.”
Rosetta in "Boli&me” and Venus in “Tann-
hauser” were in prospect. She gave news of
Bryceson Treharne, released from a German
prison and now doing well in the United
States. The lady herself has a personal in-
terest in the war, in the shape of a husband
(John Monday) at the Front.
Oscar Asche has had a neat new idea for
the latest edition of “Chu Chin Chow.”
Lily Bray ton has throughout the season
sung of a Desert Lover, but he remained a
person of the imagination. Now* he has
been materialised, makes a picturesque
appearance, and sings a duet with her. The
original song said that “his kisses drew
blood,” but they did not prove to be exactly
that kind on the stage.
“Andrew Ralph”: Olive Wilton as Mrs.
Archer in “De Luxe Annie” strikes me
again as one of the most capable all-round
women on the Australian stage. Besides suc-
cess in a variety of parts with William
Anderson and Brandon Cremer, she has given
excellent interpretations in such widely-
different roles as the cripple boy in “The
Confession,” Miladi in “The Three Mus-
keteers,” with Julius Knight, and Black
Meg in “The Christian.” She was equally
effective as Lady Isabel and Barbara Hare
in “East Lynne,” Madame Dupont, sen.,
in “Damaged Goods,” and Queen Gertrude in
“Hamlet.” As the maiden aunt in one of
Hale Hamilton’s comedies she scored a suc-
cess and Idled the place of Frediswyde
Hunter-Watts in Allan Wilkie’s co. in “For
the King.”
“C. Ockney”: Re the rivalry amongst
theatrical showmen, an example of which
is given by “Peter” (B. 25/7/T8), some
amusing yarns are told of the late George
Edwardes, who always “thought imperially”
and spoke similarly regarding his expansive
business. Leaving an opposition show on
the first night of a musical comedy, he was
asked his opinion of the piece. “I am
afraid it is a success,” he replied, adding in
a mournful drawl: “I’m sure I don’t know
why!” A well-known London comedian, who
had once been under the great man’s man-
agement, had found a “backer” and blos-
somed out as a star on his own, exploiting
himself at a theatre near the Gaiety, which
was Edwardes’s headquarters. A lady mem-
ber of the co. supporting the new headliner
one day received a note from the Gaiety boss
offering her an engagement. The star com-
edian was furious and dashed off a letter to
Edwardes, in which he said, “I don’t think
it cricket for one manager to engage an
artist behind another manager’s back.”
Edwardes’s answer ran thus: “Dear Sir, —I
did not know you were a manager, nor do
I believe it now.”
“B. J.”: Mclntosh’s latest catch,' Espinosa,
is scarcely the dancer he once was, but as
a “producer” he takes a heap of beating.
The Tivoli chorus and ballet have improved
greatly under him. Like all good men in his
line, he is a great autocrat during rehearsals.
If even one of the gaudy principals, used to
more free and easy methods, ventures a sug-
gestion he (or more often she) is promptly
squashed with, “Kindly do not talk during
rehearsal.”
“Hamlet, Junior”: During the last per-
formance of “The Willow* Tree” at the Adel-
aide Royal, the curtain fell, or rather, the
screens closed on the first act. a little before
due time owing to Kathlene Macdonell faint-
ing. Quite 75 per cent, of the house thought
it was part of the play, but experienced play-
goers realised that something was amiss
when they heard the “bump,” which was too
loud for a stage fall, and when Waldron
called over his shoulder for the curtain. Miss
Macdonell can add another spray .to her
laurel wreath for the way she pulled off the
rest of the play. It was a plucky achieve-
ment.
“Glen II.”: Congreve’s “The Way of the
World,” revived in London after many years
by the Stage Society, did not fill a long-felt
want. Apparently its wit was never given
a fair chance, owing to the feebleness of the
acting. The principal part was played by
Gilbert Cannan, a clever novelist and drama
tic critic, but, seemingly, a bad actor Ilk
fellow critics gave him beans. “While Mr
Cannan was on the stage.” wrote one “he
succeeded not only in spoiling his own nart
but everybody’s else.” Cannan, whose
methods as a critic are satirised bv Shaw m
“Fanny’s First Play,” in which he is intro-
duced as Mr. Gunn,” was the co-re in
J. M. Barrie’s action for divorce.
“OH, BOY!” AT SYDNEY MAJESTY’S.
Tom Preston , Jack Hooker and Rita Nugent
in the “Rushing Pony Rag."
“Bluebeard”: This yarn is told of Ned
Egan, the ’ late George Lauri’s devoted
dresser. One night in Brisbane the Gov-
ernor paid a visit behind the scenes and
called on the comedian. Egan, who had not
met vice-royalty before, burst into the dress-
ing-room and excitedly announced, “The
Excelsior to see you, Mr. Lauri!”
OUT OF HOURS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
For thirty years I’ve followed Du vine,
An actor stout and stern;
But small attention lie has won,
And little he can earn
For all his worth. To one stale role,
Poor chap, he’s reconciled.
He plays the father, honest soul.
Who through four acts is steeped in dole
And weeps for his lost child.
Or maybe lie’s a cheery dad
Whose fortunes know reverse,
And who upon his wayward lad
Must pile a parent’s curse,
lie’s sometimes weak, he’s often blind,
And, anyhow, ho cries.
The hound who “rooned his gel’’ to find
He rushes through the snow and wind,
And there he often dies.
The other day in Hilling's bar
A pale youth spoke to him.
Dunne waved him off, and stood afar.
His words were cold and grim.
The pale youth said: “I am your son.
I’m sick and needing bread.”
Dunne's anger forced the lad to run.
“And is a man’s work never done?”
The weary actor said.

“K ” : Fred Johns, chief of S. Aus. Hansard,
has lately been attacking the persistent claim of
Vic. to having first introduced vote by ballot.
Johns insists that S.A. was the first part of
the Empire to legislatively affirm the ballot,
and that W. R. Boothby was the father of
the Australian ballot, not Nicholson, of
Vic. The facts appear to be that between
November 2 and 21, 1855, the old Leg. Coun-
cil, in debating the Constitution Bill, favored
the ballot, and later passed an Electoral Law
Bill, simultaneously introduced, making the
ballot a fact. This measure was assented to
on April 2, 1856. There had been opposition
in the ATc. Council to the ballot, but the
Nicholson resolution in favor thereof was
passed on December 19, ’55, and the ballot
became law on March 19, ’56. Vic. was the
first to use the ballot at an election, and its
ballot law came into operation a fortnight
ahead of S.A. These are the facts relied
upon by Johns to demolish Vic. But they do
not seem to demolish anything. AVffiat appears
to be clear is (1) that Vic. got the ballot
going first, and (2) that Boothby was
undoubtedly the father of what has come to
be known as “the Australian Ballot” —the
device of marking the ballot-paper with a
cross opposite the candidate voted for. The
original Vic. law, for which the ballot clauses
were drafted by Henry Chapman, father of
the present Justice Chapman, of M.L., pro-
vided for striking out the name the voter
objected to.
“Tyke”: “Arthur R.” (B. 23/5/T8) is
wrong in saying wireless signals are only
double normal strength at night in spring
and autumn. They are always at least
double at night, and very often quadruple
strength. The reason is that during the day
the wireless waves have resistance from light
waves, and absorption from heat waves
which at night are absent. The intensity of
signals is also influenced by local climatic
conditions, atmospheric temperature, etc.
Humidity causes signals to become dull,
while in intense cold they are sharp and
clear, and in fog very strong. The best time
for working is about two hours before dawn,
when the atmosphere is very favorable, and
all kinds of freak distances are possible, until
the light appears, when signals fade.
How they did it in olden time: —
It was a common thing to see the travelling
carriages of Captain Piper, Sir John Jamison, Mr.
Blaxland, Mr. Cox, Mr. leely and others drawn by
four magnificent horses. Mr. George Palmer drove
a splendid curricle and very many gentlemen drove
tandem, the prettiest style of all. I once saw three
horses driven tandem fashion in Sydney. The horses
were very highly mettled and it seemed a perilous
feat. Mr. W. E. Riley used a drag with postilions
English fashion.
From J. B. Martin’s “Reminiscences, 1532-
83” —a very rare pamphlet.
The largest Australian R.C. parish, and
perhaps the most extensive in the world, is
in the charge of Dean Iviely, Kalgoorlie
(W.A.). It is computed at 165,000 square
miles. Recently Father Lyons, who works
in the “district,” travelled 450 miles to
celebrate a marriage.
“Harrison O.”: The principal Melbourne
cemeteries have lately been invaded on the
Sabbath by representatives of tombstone-
makers, anxious to do business with the
crowds that patronise these places on the
Day of Gloom. Those who have come to
sigh over the last (and possibly only) rest-
ing-place of the dear departed are approached
by smart young canvassers (some of whom
scarcely trouble to camouflage their ulterior
motives beneath an appropriately doleful
exterior) anxious to push a special line in
tombstones, or ready with an offer to repair
the railings round the grave of the late
lamented on ridiculously easy terms. These
pests have become so brazen that the Solici-
tor-General threatens to amend the Police
Offences Act so as to make the ghoulishness
a punishable offence. It is somewhat disturb-
ing that when a person is endeavoring to derive
consolation by asking, “G Death, where is
thy sting?” a commercial traveller should
answer the question by seeking to “sting”
the mourner for the price of a jerry-built
mausoleum.
“Hamer” ; The late “Paddy” MeGirr was
fated never to see the Front. Paddy was
a loquacious cousin of the legislative McGirrs
of N. S. AA r ales. I christened him “The
Colonel” long ago, and his routine orders,
including liberal references to rum issues,
were popular. His first obstacle was an
argument about his age, but he persuaded
the heads he was only a boy. Then came
illness, a discovery of defective eyesight and
reclassification in B class. Medical Boards
discussed him, and MeGirr might have had a
job away from danger —which was just what
he didn’t want. At last, helped by a pair
of. spectacles, he got over the top. But
while his battalion was halted on the edge
of the area known as “the line,” a stray shell
came over. It didn't “lob” very close, but
cheerful MeGirr was its victim.
Victoria, requiring a new Chief Railway
Commissioner, has decided to stick to the
good old precedent and import a man. The
essentials of a railway commissioner are
that he must not know the railways, the
country, the customary wage-rates, the condi-
tions of working, or any other dashed old
thing. That was how Victoria got Speight
and Tait, and how N. S. AVales got Johnson.
“Trot”: Two proposals on the agenda
paper for the Trades Union Congress to be
held in Sydney next month will probably in-
cite the Tory press to mirthfulness. They
are
1. The establishment of a workers’ bank.
2. The inauguration of co-operative trading.
But why not? Trades-union members and
their wives and families have hundreds of
thousands of pounds in the ordinary savings
bank. With that they could do quite a lot
on a banking venture, particularly if co-
operative trading was seriously tackled. And
from co-operative trading enormous advan-
tages could be derived by the average man,
who is now looted at every stage. There are
at least a dozen industries in Australia
which Labor could get absolute control of if
it applied itself to the job of doing things
instead of blathering about them and handing
responsibility on to the unfortunate genera-
tions to come. If democratic control has any
meaning, how is it ever going to be given
practical shape unless a start is made to
show that it is practicable ?


SAUCE BOATS.
SOLID SILVER.
We are showing in one of our windows dozens
of Solid Silver Sauce Boats, at prices that are actually
less than Electro Silver ones can be sold for to-day.
HOW?
Our London buyer made forward contracts, when
silver was only one-half of its present value, for a
given larsre quantity to be delivered monthly.
Those we are selling are some of them, bought by
us at less than one-half present prices, and so we
are able to sell Solid Silver at less than Electro-
plate in the always-useful Sauce Boats. They last
for life. They look good. They are the best, and
they never break. It is a question if they are not
really cheaper than China in actual use.

See that the next suite
you buy it upholstered in
r
Rexine
—the perfect leather substitute.
This is an exact replica of leather, with the same
grains and the same colourings. It has all the charm
of leather but costs only one quarter the price and is
better in every way. It wears better, does not crack or
peel and is unaffected by stains or grease, and is germ and
insect proof. It gives years of service and never gets
shabby, as it can be washed if soiled.
For all upholstering — furniture, motor cars, railway
carriages, etc. —it is the ideal material.
Ask to see samples.

The Latest HUDSON SUPER-SIX is a Speedster
If The newest Hudson Super-Six model is a four-passenger Speedster. Because
of its graceful lines, the beauty of the finish, and the wonderful speed it
possesses we think it rightly expresses “the spirit of youth.” coach
is painted rich cobalt blue, and the wheels are in English vermilion. It is
mounted on the same Hudson Super-Six Chassis that has won so many
notable records for power, speed and endurance. \Go to the nearest Hudson

Gentlemen,
Enclosed herewith please find
cheque in settlement of cost of
Quirk’s Air Gas Plant for lighting
my hotel. I would like to state
how highly satisfied I am with
the working. It has given satis*
faction in every respect. It is
simple to work, in fact a boy can
control it. I may say that I have
carefully checked the cost of lighting
the hotel; the result is simply un-
believable. In November with the
acetylene plant the cost of Carbide
was £l5/2/6 for the month. With
the Quirk’s Gas Plant the cost was
one case of Petrol for the same time.
I will in the course of a few weeks
instal the light in two other hotels
1 control.
You may use this letter in any
manner you please, as I think the
public should know what a saving
it is to them, and I am pleased to
show any one who should like to
see the working of same in this
district.
I remain,
yours respectfully,
(Signed) CHARLES BREWER.

Neurasthenia.
In these war times many people are liv-
ing in an unnatural condition of nervous
excitement. Unless something is done to
correct it the inevitable result will be a
nervous breakdown, an exhaustion ol ner-
vous energy that may take a very serious
and unforeseen turn.
Neurasthenia is one such result, with u s
accompaniment of worry, irritation, ovei-
sensitiveness and severe headache. tt
means that the patient has lost the powei
to recover and store up energy. The condi-
tion will grow worse if not corrected.
The treatment is one of nutrition ot tue
nerve cells, requiring a non-alcoholic tonic.
As the nerves get their nourishment from
the blood the treatment must be directe
towards building up the blood. Dr. '\h'
liams’ Pink Pills act directly on the mood
and, with proper regulation of the diet, have
proved of the greatest benefit in many case,
of neurasthenia. A tendency to anaemia, o
bloodlessness, shown by most neurasthenic
patients is also corrected by these tom
pills. . e

“899” : I propose the health of “Deaf Jack”
Johnson, fighting Australian. How he got
into the first contingent is a mystery, as he
was extremely hard of hearing, stammered a
little and was much under the height stan-
dard. i guess his big heart offset these
things, for he left with the first batch. He
organised donkey races in the main streets
of Cairo and planted the Australian flag on
top of the Second Pyramid, being, I believe,
the first white man to do the full ascent
without assistance. When the time came
for us to go to Lemnos, Jack was kept behind
as hospital orderly on account of his deaf-
ness. Our crowd was unnaturally quiet for
a few weeks, but when the second reinforce-
ments arrived, a few days before the Land-
ing, John was there, all smiles. He had
managed to elude the hospital authorities,
travelled 100 miles by train, stowed away on
board the transport, and finally arrived at
Lemnos without detection. “What does this
mean, Johnson?” roared the sergeant. “I’ve
l-lobbed back,” said Jack. “A fat lot of
use you’ll be,” sneered Stripes. Replied
John: “I d-don’t shoot Turks with my
b-blanky ears, do I?” After a lurid time on
the Peninsula, he was finally knocked and
sent back to Australia. Some of the tales
of his exploits had reached his native village,
and he received an uproarious welcome on
stepping from the train. Jack eyed the fit male
members of the crowd and, in reply to the
speech of welcome, shot back: “If some of
you b-big stiffs thought so much of me, you’d
go, and take my place over there!”
“McNorth”: Why do such a lot of people
“down south” begin perspiring as soon as
the North is mentioned? Up here, which is
as far north as one can get without stepping
off Australia’s uttermost point, the climate
comes to this: If there is wind it is cool; if
there is no wind it is hot. But as the south-
east trades blow with almost unfailing regu-
larity for eight moons and then return from
the north-west with rain, cool days are the
general rule. The average winter tempera-
ture is 79 deg. Eah., while the summer aver-
age is 82 —three degrees of difference only.
The day lengths of the two seasons vary by
about an hour. The climate is almost too
pleasant. Perhaps if the North were climati-
cally disagreeable it would forge ahead.
Alleged civilisation seems to flourish best in
places that suffer from second-hand weather
conditions.
“Camelero”: Let me have a say while my
gun cools about the issue of brass “A’s,”
chevrons and other decorations which Bill-
jim is supposed to wear. The red and blue
service chevrons are not viewed with very
much enthusiasm by our chaps here in
Palestine. It is the story of the “gold”
wounded stripe over again. The average
Billjim has no time for advertisement, and
he does not passionately desire to decorate
his person with sundry devices. I have met
scores of officers and men in the Light Horse
and Camel Corps who simply ignore chev-
rons and the Gallipoli “A.” One (a major)
has been thrice wounded, fought throughout
the Peninsular campaign, and later on in
Sinai and Palestine. “Why should I decorate
myself with things that are worn by fellows
who were on the Peninsula for a week or
two, got a scratch and secured a soft job at
the base?” he said. I know men who came
over here three years ago and who have
never been near a firing-line, yet they are
wearing one red and three blue chevrons.
It’s generally the fellows who have soft jobs
far from the firing-line who display these
decorations. Trooper Billjim, somewhere
beyond the Jordan, with his two and three
years’ service, is too busy biffing Abdul to
trouble about them.
“Solomon M.” sees a vision:—
In my opinion the Face at the Window is the
most sinister feature in politics to-day. I will not
speculate as to who owns the Face, but I have my
own ideas. Its component features and its methods
of operation are matters for individual speculation.
As to its consequences they seem obvious enough.
For instance, John Storey was warmly in favor of
voluntary recruiting, as were most of his friends.
That was their excuse for being against compulsory
recruiting. They brought about the rejection of
compulsory recruiting and then the Face appeared to
them, and they who had been warm grew cold. The
Face howled at them, and they became actively
hostile. Some began to advocate compulsion again—
the compulsory withdrawal of our voluntary recruits.
Storey disclaimed most earnestly all connection with
the criminal and treasonable I.W.W. . organisation.
Presumably he was called to order by the Face,
for he suddenly decided that the 12 incendiaries
who were convicted after open . trial were
“fellow citizens,” to prove whose innocence
Laborites must “never cease their efforts.” In
short, ever since the I.W.W. crowd or its backers
obtained possession of the Face at the Window
Laborites have been busy changing their opinions,
always in a pro-Hun and anti-Australian direction.
This unseen but strongly-felt Apparition at the
Casement ought to be tracked down and hanged, or
marooned on an atoll, or something like that.
The Victorian Assembly commenced busi-
ness with the usual three weeks’ uncivil
conversation about the Address in Reply.
This is not a time (nor is any other time a
time) for useless luxuries (supposing three
weeks of discursive recrimination is a lux-
ury) and the Address-in-Reply is quite super-
fluous. Victoria once did without the
Address; that was when Irvine the Iceberg
and Bent the Hot and Perspiring called a
session at a moment’s notice to break the
railway strike. They established a good pre-
cedent but lacked the sense to keep it going.
“Bill Bowyang”: The average English
Tommy is going to shift the furniture in
his own country when he has finished with
Berlin Bill and Co. When the roof was
lifted off Sheol he came from somewhere in
Berkshire, or nearabouts. Generally he
was a thin, weedy youngster, and very sorry
for himself, but after being in the army a
few months he had inches more of chest
measurement and a lot of new ideas. He
realised that there really were such things
as freedom and independence. Since then
his whole world has been swung round, and
he has been placed amqpgst men of every
kind and class. He will return to civilian
life a totally different being from the chap
who went forth, and that is what Bull and his
papers largely ignore when they talk about
post-war problems. There will be lots of
excitement for the placid Old Country when
Mars dismisses his school.

MILLINERY
Sydney, August 5, 1918.
My Dear Aiuni
Our Town Hall has housed many stirring
scenes, but none more exhilarating than the
huge fourth of August celebration (held on
August 3). With good news coming in from
the Western Front the air was electric with
enthusiasm. Round the galleries were hung
the names of those battles in which Aus-
tralians had plucked a few leaves of laurel,
and if Galliopli reminded us of a magnificent
failure, Pozieres was boldly lettered to recall
the forward push in France. Clad in the
mayoral rabbit-skin, Joynton Smith showed
tags of crimson ribbon from liis waist-line.
Above hung the great gold chain of office. A
municipal father in such splendor makes the
frock-coat and etceteras of a mere Governor
a dull Sabbath-day attire. But there was
nothing dull in his Kx.’s speech. Resonant
and manly in tone and sentiment, it got the
ovation of the meeting from 4000 throats.
“Our inflexible determination to maintain
our ideals of liberty and justice,” was also
joyously acclaimed by Billjim. A gallery of
soldiers, well-groomed to a hair, was the in-
spiration of the best platform speeches—
those by Governor Davidson and the Mayor.
The Cullens were in the front line, amongst
the vice-regal chairs. Behind the army, the
navy and the plain citizen was a choir of
girls from Paddington State School, whose
treble voices pealed national airs. Musical-
director T. S. Tearne directed the baton.
Some day Chief Secretary Fuller may have
recourse to a fan when women’s deputations
raise the blush to his manly cheek. Flattery
is not the usual vehicle of these affairs, but
Mrs. Laura Luffman, who presides over the
resolutions and amendments of the Women’s
Reform League, adroitly served the melted
butter. William McMillan led the ladies,
whose chief prayer was for electoral pro-
portional representation. No, it’s not some-
thing to eat.
The Wattle League (N. S. Wales branch)
last week held its annual clean:-up
of the balance-sheet in the Royal Society’s
House. Governor Davidson held down the
chair, morally supported by the League presi-
dent, J. H. Maiden, of the Botanic Gardens.
Hon sec. Mrs. Agnes Ivettlewell, another
founder of the League, had to whisk her
good man off’ to the bush for a rest cure, but
she left in her place R. H. Cambage, who
read the secretarial report. Learned disser-
tations from president Maiden (elected again
to the chair for the tenth time) were gar-
nished with interludes by the Feldwiek
quartet and John Lane Mullins, M.L.C. The
Governor, after expressing his long apprecia-
tion of the lovely yellow blossoms —he had
the wattle planted on hilltops of Cevlon years
ago—chatted of Arbor Day in S’Africa. In
the gathering was Mrs. Clunies Ross, one of
the little band who assisted at the Wattle
League’s christening in 1909.
“Our Boys at the Front” is the title of a
new series of Australian postcards which
picture the history, week by week, of our
home men’s part in the great war. For Is.
you can buy a set of nine pictures of Billjim
setting the pace as gunner, infantryman,
stretcher-bearer, cook or at any other job
that comes his way. The cards will be
issued monthly. All profits go to the War
Chest.
Sydney remembers the Rev. John Walker
as a youngish Moderator of the Presbyterian
Assembly, and a most determined “beggar”
for charity organisations. When John
Walker (lie wasn’t Moderator then) toured
the Outback in search of help for kirk funds,
he got amazing results in money or kind.
If the farmer couldn’t give a horse, the blithe
Christian would cheerily offer to take, a
sulky or a bullock or £5. He would even
express his readiness to accept the first
fruits of the harvest. For some years he
has been in Ballarat (Vic.). He has given
his five sons to the firing-line. Two had
fallen in action when news came of the
death of the third, J. Stuart Dight (his
mother’s maiden name) Walker, M.C., Cap-
tain A.I.F. This son was an old boy
of Sydney Grammar and an engineering
giaduate of Sydney University. He threw
up a good billet in W.A. as mine manager
to bolt for the danger zone. His bereaved
mother is just home after having a look at
her lads during their occasional week-ends
in London. Daughter Marjorie is on active
service with Australian military nurses.
There’s an evening party at Government
House this week, the first of its kind since
the Stricklands packed up. The guests of
honor will be St. John Ambulancers.
Married in her father’s home, Gladys, a
daughter of journalist W. F. Corbett, to
E. Gawler, of Randwick. The bride’s
mother was one of the founders of the Vol-
untary Workers’ Cafe, and her death- left a
gap in that, busy circle.
At the Presbyterian Kirk, Beecroft,
Flora, a daughter of the David McCalls,
made the expected response when Lieut.
Walter Rogers produced the ring. The
’groom is the only son of Captain Rogers,
of Wellington, M.L. The gill wore a shim-
mer of white satin with a drape of lloniton
lace, and walked up the aisle with a great
sheaf of lilies in her arms. Her sister Agnes
and Madeline McFayden were the brides-
maidens. The cake was cut at Lindisfarne,
the parental nest.
The Choral Society’s war anniversary con-
cert brought a seething mass of humanity to
the Town Hall. In the centre of the hall
pot plants, a carpet square, and the padded
seats of state, warned the company of the
approach of sub-royalty. The society’s
choral work was much better than on some
previous occasions, and hon. conductor
Reginald Gooud shook up his voices in Elgar’s
“The Fourth of August” and in “To Women,”
by the same composer. “For the Fallen,”
included in this Elgar tribute to “The Spirit
of England,” was the most impressive item.
When two A.I.F. buglers sounded the Last
Post, feminine handkerchiefs softly dabbed
wet eyes. Muriel Barton, the soprano solist.
was hardly equal vocally to the heroic music
of the Elgar trilogy. In the second half of
a meaty programme Ella Caspers sang the
classic “Che Faro,” and she is not likely to
sing it better. An almost flawless perfonn-
a nee.
Lionel J. Hurley,
second son of the late
John Hurley, M.L.A.
for Lithgow, was in
London when Ger-
many unloaded more
than the wobbling
dynasty will ever get
back. He offered his
services in any capa-
city, was turned
down for the firing-
line, but got the job
of driving motors or
any wheeled thing
that bustled in the
Mons get-away. For
his work in that
famous action he
wears the enviable
M o n s decoration.
Later he concentrated on ordnance, and put
in 12 months’ work at Woolwich Arsenal,
lie has since been loaned by the British War
Office to the A.I.F. Ordnance. After seeing
the inside of various French and English
hospitals (as a sick man) he is back in his
home-land on furlough. You can salute him
as Lieut.-Golonel in the A.I.F. He collected
a C.M.G. early this year. The photo of this
good Australian is the craft of Judith
Fletcher.
Soldiers’ Day got its big push from
the kiddies. When 12,000 youngsters
march through a city you can allow each
child about three relatives to turn
out with admiring eyes. Mum and the
family congested the pavements and over-
flowed the streets. Wheeled traffic fled to
side lanes to avoid the human flood. In a
crisis of this kind the Sydney horse, accus-
tomed to pageants, can be depended on to
behave like a gentleman. Right under his
nose, and recklessly butting his chin, thou-
sands of women and children moved un-
harmed on Friday. The credit of the big
draw, which resulted in one of the finest
spectacles the old town has seen, is due to
the tireless State-school teachers. The long
line of over three miles of girls’ skirts and
boys’ knickers was admirably managed,
moving forward with gorgeous banners and
the spring of youth in its heels. To the
dominies who had all the hard work in con-
nection with the safe conduct of such a
vast number of little lives mere praise is a
poor expression of the ordinary citizen’s
admiration.
Moore-street and Martin-place were as
full of the faithful Comforts’ Funds and
other tents as on previous Days. The usual
lorries with more or less musical parties,
packed like sardines, rumbled through the
town. At the saluting base in Bridge-street
Governor Davidson hurried into action at
11 a.m., having already wafted the official
opening remarks over Martin-place.
In Moore-street, by the way, the Kinder-
garten, Linion. which had been bought out
at a modest figure by the Soldiers’ League
organisation (President Alex. Jobson was
responsible for the effort), demonstrated.
With the assistance of the invaluable infant
who attends the free schools where babies
are taught by playmg games and having
Froebel’s fun, the long platform became a
miniature school-room. August 2 was oiigi-
nally chosen as the Kindergarten Fay. ri -
ing stepped aside (£2OOO was the price)
the Kindergartens held up their end of the
stick to the best of their powers. A young
spectacled school marm handed out
“tracts” about the hapless child of mean
streets. Maybe the Ford Mayor got
one and will give some thought to
the mean-street evil. Accustomed to
the publicity of back lane or city P a ik>
the Kindergarten infant, going through the
regular routine, was unconscious of a thou-
sand eyes that watched its play-worn.
Washing up tiny cups and saucers, sewing
Lilliputian garments, or reading a nursery
story, they gave the public some of the
happiest moments in a crowded day.
Captain Carol D’Arey Irvine, killed in
France the other day, was a nephew of the
Archdeacon whose millinery is so well
known at Rose Bay. Both his sons are at
the Front, and messages of sympathy
weighted the morning post after Carol s
death was cabled.
The notion of having a conversazione
before the Hospice Concert, on August 15,
has been wisely abandoned. Two bites at a
financial cherry are likely to hit the stone.
A Town Hall musical show is a big under-
taking, and needs all the attention it can
get. That over, the conversazione will
follow as a supplement.
The eloquent Thomas Tait, meenister of
the old Scots’ Church, was the hero of an
evening party to celebrate his third anni-
versary in the historic pulpit on Church Hill.
An acadeitiic chair for his (the place
where the guid man thinks out his sermons)
and a handsome piece of silver for the lady
of the manse were lately handed over by
Dominie Aspinall of Scots’ College. ihe
ancient church on the hill, by the way. was
built in 1N24. and had its pulpit cushion
vigorously thumped for over 50 years by
John Diinmore Lang. The G.-C. Munro
Ferguson unveiled a roll of honor in the
venerable edifice a Sunday or two ago.
From Brisbane
The Town Planning Conference is in full swing.
Delegates from all the States are dividing their time
between the Exhibition Hall, where the display is
being made, and in jaunting round the town. Home
Sec. Huxham and his wife entertained the visitors
at a river trip on Wednesday, and a garden party
is promised for Saturday. Mrs. Ryan is taking the
bunch round our baby clinics and kindergartens per
motor. On Friday morning she gave a tea at the
Belle Vue.
The Governor-General and Lady Helen are with
us, and will stay over Show week.' His Ex. is at
the Queensland Club, and Lady Helen is at Fern-
berg as the guest of their Exes.
Kathleen Mar, daughter of the late Robert Mar,
once Government Analyst, was married in Rock-
hampton last week to William Williams, Inspector
of Mines for the Central district. The bride’s
mother will be remembered as Ada Dean, the con-
tralto. Robert Mar was the Bananaland and Aus-
tralian draughts champion.
The Patriotic Fund wants money badly. A drive
will be held until September 28, and collections
taken up weekly. The money is required chiefly
for relief work among soldiers’ dependants.
The Q.T.C. Red Cross meeting at Eagle Farm last
Saturday gave the funds a welcome lift. The sum
of £lOO was donated by Mrs. Lumley Hill, whose
horse won the big race of the day. Our vice-royalties
were present, with Captain Cosens shadowing.
The Australian
nursing*sister whose
serene and dignified
face looks at you in
his little picture, has
been awarded the
Mons medal. Whether
the rumor that the
King is to pin it on
her uniform shortly is
true, even her own
relatives do not
know at present.
Sister Lilian Suttor
left for England in
the fateful July be-
fore the declaration
of war. She was
at sea on August 4.
Arrived safely in
London she offered
her services to the Australian Voluntary
Hospital, Wimereux, anrl was sent to
France in November. The N. S. Wales
Nightingale remained on at the A.V.H. for
some time, and worked for the wounded in
its wards after it had been taken over by
the British War Office. It then became
No. 32 Stationary Hospital. Writing to
her relatives in Sydney in May of this year,
Sister Suttor says: “The army has added
to and improved the old hospital very much,
but I have never been in any so well
equipped with surgical appliances as the
Australian Voluntary.” In July. 1917, the
lady in the snowy white linen millinery was
transferred to another British hospital in
Rouen, where her photo, by the way, was
taken. This copy of the original was done
by Freeman. Later, she has been moved
on to Etaples General Hospital and reported
“well and safe” after the attentive Him
had bombed it in May of this year. Sister
Suttor, a daughter of the late W. H. Suttor.
M.L.C., and Mrs. Suttor, of Springfield
(Sydney), belongs to the well-known
Bathurst clan. She was a trained nurse of
many years’ experience when the Lid blew
off, and had. been matron both of her home
town district hospital and of the Welling-
ton (N.S.W.) Hospital.
Back in the old dugout on the Tivoli stage
Frank Greene, under a tin hat, ’phones to
Nellie Leaeh on the other side of a paper
wall. Nellie’s blithesome soprano gurgles
sweetly, “Hello, my dearie,” under suitable
millinery—a wisp of tulle that makes believe
to be a sunbonnet.
After a long tramp round every available
and generally unsuitable skyline in the city,
little Mary Edwards has found a studio.
She’s back at the old address in Jamieson-
street. Before setting out to paint black,
brown and piebald society in 1 acific Isles
that’s where her easel used to stand.
Master-mariner Jim Fotheringhame, for
years making his headquarters in Sydney,
has just been promoted by the Admiralty.
Failing to get to the Front in any capacity,
because he was over the age-limit (though
tough as nails and able to see any hardship
through), he went to India, and hadn’t long
to wait before his services were accepted. He
was given command of a big mail-steamer,
and bossed the bridge till the ship was
commandeered by the British Government.
He was highly recommended for his
skill, and passed into the R.N.R. as
lieut. Promotion has since been rapid, for
he is now Lieut.-Commander of a warship
on patrol work. For conspicuous service the
Admiralty passed across to him a cheque
Fotheringhame comes of fighting stock.
A maternal grand-dad, Lieut. Joseph Miller,
has a line in Britain’s history book for
valor. Congratulations on her sailor s suc-
cess are going to the little lady whose busy
pen has recorded Sydney’s social doings for
the last five-and-twenty years.
From “Rosna,” in London: —
One of our gallant Australian girls, Sister Narelle
Hobbs, has overtaxed her strength nursing in Malta,
India and Mesopotamia for more than three years,
and is so seriously ill that the doctors give little
hope of her. She is being sent home to see if the
good Australian air will pull her round. She worked
with Queen Alexandra’s Military Nursing Service.
A “Homes-for-Soldiers’ Day” has suddenly
bobbed up. The date will be the second
Friday in September. The Voluntary W Olli-
ers?’ Association (Elizabeth-street) will supply
details.
There are two things never absent from
any patriotic matinde —the large lady who
sucks peppermint or aniseed lozenges and
digs her elbows into her neighbors’ ribs, and
the casual individual who drops items
of light luggage and expects the best-
mannered man in her vicinity to immedi-
ately scrape around for them and restore
them to her condescending lap. A recent
Gift afternoon found these nuisances and the
busy raffler in their best form.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORTAN.

For t Plates : —British-made.
The Folding Ivlito is without doubt THE Camera for amateurs who require
an inexpensive, compact instrument that will do good work, as it possesses
many advantages which place it absolutely in the forefront of camera values.
mn
It has the advantage over all film cameras that
(1) The cost per exposure is lowc% —a dozen of
the best plates, Imperial, Ilford or AY ellington,
costs 2/'6 as against 3/- for films.
(2) One or two exposures can be made, and
developed; thus, if any error lias been made, it
can be rectified at small cost. \A ith films half a
dozen exposures must be made before one can be
developed.
(3) Every picture can be seen on the ground
glass of the Folding Klito, and focussed to a nicety.
You can thus be certain that what is on the ground
glass will come out clear and sharp on the plate.
It can be used as a hand camera pure and simple,
or with a tripod, and has seasoned wood body,
covered waterproof leatherette, Leather Bellows,
Reversing View Finder, Focussing Scale, Infinity
Catch, Focussing Back, and Ensign Junior Shutter,
giving Time, Bulb and Instantaneous Exposures.

VOCALION
My first impulse was to buy a
“talking machine’’ for the
entertainment of the family.
We met in town, my wife and
I, to make the purchase. 1
knew there were many makes,
but the first I beard seemed
good enough. To humor the
little lady we went to one
place, then to another, yet 1
thought the next instrument
was as good as the last. Then
we heard the VOCATION. . . .
The tone was better, more
musical, than any other I had
heard. At the end of the
selection all was silent, it
had automatically stopped. A
further demonstration of the 'VOCAL! OX'S refinements and
“GRADUOLA” expression control satisfied me-fhat here was the instru-
ment most worthy of a place in my home. I PURCHASED THE
VO CALI OX, SATISFIED THAT IT WAS THE BEST.

My Dear Yarrie, —
The Australian Steeplechase at Caulfield
fell in with a warm day, so the sporting best-
dressers didn’t know what to do. They
wanted to be butterflies and sport in the
sun, but you can’t be a butterfly in winter
furs and dark clothes. The racegoers who
really enjoyed the sun were a dozen or more
cot cases from the local military hospital, who
were wheeled across and set on the lawn near
the bandstand. The convalescents who could
walk about! clustered round bringing tips
and news from the paddock. Mrs. Stuart
Brunton was among the dark-clad army.
Mrs. Alan Tye flew a frivolous bunchy
blue embroidered veil from a tiny hat, and
wore bine serge. Mrs. Rolfe (Warm am bool)
appeared in purple and ermine. Mrs. Frank
Clarke had a Spring-like lingerie brim to
• her white hat and wrapped herself in er-
mine. The latest hat towers 12 or 14 inches
in the air. Muriel Eccles walked with her
father the doctor and supported a sort of
tea-cosy. Mrs. Dan Taylor’s brown hat
peaked up like an Indian’s turban.
Details are to hand about the death of
Coventor-General Ferguson’s mother. She
died at the family estate, Itaith, Kirkcaldy
(Scotland), and was laid to rest in the pri-
vate burial-ground at Castlehill, Raith. Two
pipers led the cortege. Millet said she was
the best amateur artist he had k'noWn.
Although of English origin, she acquired
Queen Victoria’s love of the Highlands,
which were largely illustrated by her brush,
in pictures treasured by the family. As a
raconteur she was peculiarly distinguished
by wit and wisdom.
Handsome old squatter Tom Camming
died during the week. He was the father
of a family of handsome daughters and
good-looking sons. Rupert Clarke became
T.C.’s son-in-law when he married the
daughter who is now Lady Grey-Egerton.
Muriel, a dark-eyed beauty, married an aide
to one of our Governors. He is now
Brigadier-General Buchanan—one of the
youngest of his rank in the army. The
third daughter married St. Leger Robertson.
Gumming was an ardent pure merino man.
There has always been a sort of professional
feud between the pure merino and crossbred
men.
Mrs. Fan Dango Mackay has been
chaperoning two YVestralian nieces and
giving them a good time in Melbourne. The
visitors, Kath and Isabel Cusack, are going
home under Mrs. Mackay’s wing this week.
Mrs. Billy ’Williams gave them all a fare-
well party at her St. Kilda-road house.
City Engineer Morton and his wife (she
was one of the Bond girls of Hawthorn)
have followed the Gaud Mayoral party to
Brisbane. Melbourne Town - Clerk Ellery
has gone also and taken Mrs. Ellery. The
Weedon knight is likewise there.
There are to.be only two women in Cap-
tain Conant’s next movie. Mrs. Maguire is
one. She is the wife of flying-officer
Maguire, the “exchange” warrior from Eng-
land. Miss Foster is the other young woman,
and her new engagement ring is bound to
photograph well.
The Septimus Burts, of Perth, are over
in Melbourne for a holiday. Septimus,
K.C., is the leader of the Westralian Bar,
and his legal connections go back a long way.
The original firm of Stone and Burt was
the first established in the State, and its
offices have been the nursery of much legal
talent. The K.C. himself, who lias had the
refusal of the C.J.-ship more than once, had
his training there, as also did Edward Stone,
Lieut.-Governor arid ex-Chief Justice.
Mrs. Jimmy Dyer is in a private hospital
and likely to stay there for a while. An
operation on her throat has left her very
weak,
Aileen McCance, a sweet young ’Varsity
student of 19, has'followed in the footsteps
of sister Olive by winning the Higgins
scholarship, an interval of three years separ-
ating the triumphs. The girls are sisters
of Norman, a youthful journalist and
treasurer of the A.J.A.
Coldstream has started an Honor Avenue
of gum-trees for soldiers of the district.
Melba planted the first tree in the line for
an old friend, Captain Fitzclarence, who
gave his life at Gallipoli.
Hastening to the bedside of a sick sister in
America, Mrs. Ambrose Pratt took ill herself
and had to leave the boat at Suva to enter
hospital.
Nigel Brock's brother George has been
killed in the relentless war.
Bigjohn Forrest and his wife had two
cabins knocked into one for their journey to
England. Marie Tempest, Graham Browne
and Ada Reeve sailed by the same boat.
Major-General Stanley was also aboard.
Weston Pett’s tall son has just left ordi-
nary school to enter the Point Cook Flying
School.
Two well-known Riverina men will go
into camp as soon as the shearing is over.
They are Simon Fraser, jun., eldest son of
the ex-Senator, and Alick Mcßean, who
gives up management of Mundooran station
to accompany brother-in-law Simon. The
two other Fraser brothers are already in
khaki, one in King Edward’s Horse and the
other with the Light Horse in Palestine.
The Katinka Motor Ball took place under
a tricolor canopy at the Town Hall on Mon-
day of last week. The Tarrants and Katinka
theatricals were responsible. Colonel and
Mrs. Tarrant rested in the balcony, and the
slagefolk grand-marched after their night’s,
work was over at Her Majesty’s. The
floor was crowded.
Lester’s Hotel, in Ballarat, has been
turned into a magnificent rest home for
soldiers.
The returned soldiers call the red-lapelled
home-service men “Rosellas.”
For the Australian Comforts Fund the
bunch of girls who ran the “Our Boys’
Shop” appeal deserve a specal pat on the
back for a good result. A cheque for £1691
was handed Gaud Mayor Stapley. The ex-
penses, were only £2 10s.
Camberwell managed to scrape up about
£lOOO each day for four days during its
carnival.
Mrs. Frank Mitchell is busy founding up
Ricliinondites for a concert on August 28.
The proceeds are to go to the Melba Free
Kindergarten, and Stella Power is to sing
with some of the diva’s students.
The sweet lady of
the silver hair, who
has been pictured
by Mina Moore, is
the wife of Dr. Cri-
velli. With all her
heart in France
(where her sisters,
brothers and other
relations are all in-
volved in war
troubles, and where
her Australian-born
sobs are lighting),
Mrs. Crivelli was
-prime worker in the
big 1 to 31 appeal for
the French during
July. She exults at
the wonderful result
—two million francs
won by a si lont, dignified appeal. There
were no raffles', buttons or sales of goods.
The French women simply took up positions
in the streets and waited for contributions.
Mrs. Crivelli works unceasingly for the Red
Cross and has also a special mission to which
she devotes a lot of time. In conjunction
with her sister. Mrs. Oaubet, in Paris, she
works for the Society Maternelle, which
helps the wives and children of French sol-
diers.
Cousin Adelaide’s notes
The Rejected Volunteers’ Association, with Major
W. Ir. Stuart as its president and E. 0. Evans as
secretary, is making good progress. It has a mem-
bership of 1000, lias decided to raise half a battalion
for the home-defence scheme, and has handed over to
the Cheer-Up Society £2,12 raised by a patriotic
football match.'
Members of the Australian Flying Corps in Pales-
tine are making a name for themselves. Amongst
them tiie Andrew Smiths’ son, Ross, has added the
Distinguished Flying Cross to the M.C. and Bar that
he already had. Also, he has gone up a step in
•rank—if you can speak of steps in the.air. He is
now flight-commander.
An Australian sailor to win distinction is Seaman-
Gunner G. E. Staples, the only South Australian who
was in the Zeebrugge raid, lie and an officer were the
first to land on the Mole, and when the officer was
shot Staples led the bombing party.
The ructions in the ranks of Wattle Day Leaguers
have terminated in the decision of the Motor Ambu-
lance Committee to cut itself adrift from the parent
body and link up with the Red Cross Society.
Minda, the home near Glenelg which does such
excellent work in earing lor the feeble-minded and
epileptics, is to have the foundations of two new
buildings laid by Lady Galway and Charles Goode on
Saturday.
Australia Day's takings in the city reached £16,000,
which topped last •year's figures by £2OOO. The
appeal continues until the middle of this month.
Lieut.-Colonel Charles Birt, who was in England
When war broke out and was one of Kitchener’s
“First Hundred Thousand,” has won the D.S.O. One
sister is administrator of the British Women’s Auxil-
iary Corps in Paris; and another, who learnt her
army nursing in the Boer War, has charge of a
Red Cross Hospital in England. A brother is with
the A.I.F.
The late G. A. Wallman’s estate has been sworn
at £20,700. It goes to his widow and family.
The French people
in Melbourne are
very proud of their
Consul. M. Fliche
is a young man of
distinction and many
decorations, the chief
being the Legion of
Honor, won when
quite a youth. As a
young attache at
the French Legation
in China. Fliche dis-
tinguished himself
by heroic deeds dur-
ing the Boxer rebel-
lion. It was then
that he gained the
neat, narrow little
thread of scarlet rib-
bon that he proudly
wears in his buttonhole. He is a personal
friend of Pichon, Minister of Foreign Affairs
in France, and was attached to his staff in
Tunis. As Consul he could not take an
active part in the French appeal, the famous
1 to 31 effort of July. He could only
.accept with great thankfulness the respon-
sibility of despatching the two million francs
to the help of his gallant countrymen. This
Mina Moore portrait is a speaking likeness.
Mary Foster, the fair young blonde
who romped through the Conant movie, is
among the claimants for congratulation.
Her diamond hoop comes from Lieut. F. N.
Grimwade, son of the Norton Grimwades.
Miss Foster is? a daughter of the late
Ask-in Foster, of Maffra, Gippsland.
Heather Keep, being promised to Lieut.
Edmund Cooke, M.C., the Ernest Keeps
gave a betrothal dinner last week at Witch-
wood, South Yarra. The flanc6 is an Anzac
on furlough. He is a nephew of the Winter
Cookes of the Western District. .
Young Captain Stoddart has won the M.C.
and made fiancee Betty O’Hara a very proud
girl. Betty got .the news and also her
betrothal-ring last week. The ring is the
very latest thing in love tokens —flexible and
Set all round with little diamonds. A flexible
wedding-ring seems up to date, anyhow—
nothing too rigid and settled about it.
Mrs. Mcßride, the young widow, is to
marry Harry Beresford, a Maorilander. She
is thinking of tripping to America before
settling down again.
Editor and Mrs. Schuler are grandparents,
daughter Dorothy (Mrs. Denholm) having
acquired a son last week.
The Ted Taits are starting off to America
again. This is manager Ted’s fourth trip
to Wilsonland within three years.
Her Majesty’s matinee on Thursday for
the sick actors was a moderate success.
Various assortments of Government House
folk had bought seats; but the Exes, are
mostly on tour and the boxes were empty.
The stalls and the gallery were packed; the.
circle looked thin. Some of the patriotic
workers should have helped up this matinee,
for the stage fraternity is always helpful to
them. Still, there were infrequent attacks
on the audience by a handful of sassiety
girls languidly selling programmes and
sweets.
Actress Lilian Birtles, who played here
with Oscar Asohe, is now Mrs. Gerard Max-
well-Willshire. Hubby, as remembered
here, was a tall youth and an indifferent
actor in Asche’s train. He is now a lieuten-
ant in France. Lilian’s father-in-law is
Sir Arthur Maxwell-Willshire, and she will
one day be Lady M.-W.
At thd Actors’ Matinee on Thursday
there was an accident among the “Katinka”
doves, around which the chief song revolves.
The birds fly out into the auditorium some-
times. One. trying to get back on the stage,
was r crushed and killed by the descending
curtain. Its little white mate, perched on a
cornice, mourned drearily all through the
matinee, crooning in a deep ’cello-like note
that even the orchestra couldn’t drown.
Alexander Watson, after 34 recitals, is
devoting a week to the entertainment of the
sick and wounded in the military hospitals.
Eddie Bush, late of Fred Niblo’s combina-
tion, sends word from Toronto that he has
obtained his heart’s desire and is in the
Ganadian army. He left a good part in the
Belasco-Frohman Spring attraction to enlist.
From Louis Esson in London:—
My half-brother, Frank brown, has put in
liis last few weeks in London before going
over to France. The Australians have been
in great form lately, and the French papers
liavy paid them some eloquent tributes. Con-
ditions here, with raids, food shortage, a quarter-
pound limit on the weekly meat, with few substi-
tutes, scarcity of matches, etc., and absurdly high
prices for everything are bad enough blit in no
way desperate. Britain up to the present has never
been seriously threatened; but the many restrictions
make life somewhat depressing.
Sid McCubbin, youngest son of the late
artist Fred, has become a maker of toys.
His orders have brought him in £6 a week,
which represents all the work he can take by
himself and the help of a boy. The manu-
facturer is out now after machinery to
increase his output.
Lady Stanley is opening and blessing the
next Arts and Crafts Exhibition on August
30, in the Fine Arts Galleries, Alfred Place.
An exhibition of pottery will be a feature.
Temple Court, off Collins-street, was fes-
tive in the Bohemian manner last Wednes-
day night to celebrate the return to Australia
of Mrs. Nicholas, who once was Hilda Rix.
Jack Sommers told some of his war experi-
ences; Ethel Murphy (nowadays Mrs. Tobin)
brought along her squatter husband, and
Bertha Merfield was the M.C. x\rtist Mel-
drum dropped in to pronounce his blessing.
Mrs. Griffin (wife of the architect who
drew plans for the forgotten Federal Capi-
tal) is getting up a winter series of talks
ou architecture for women. She is strongly
of opinion that a woman with a bent for
home-building can make a better architect
on the job than a man if she will study
detail. Dr. Helen Sexton has a taste for
architecture, inherited from several ances-
tral architects. She had to give this the
go-by for the sake of her medical work; but
she has just worked wonders, in a practical
amateur way, in the home of the It. 0.
Blackwoods, an ancient, prison-like house of
great solidarity in St. Kilda-road.
After another spell in a private hospital,
tenor Walter Kirby has left for Brisbane, in
the hope of recovering his appetite for tea
and cake.
Last Thursday morning Lady Stanley
visited Melba’s singing-class at the Albert-
street Conservatorium and vigorously
applauded the students. The latest addition
to the class is an Auckland girl, Miss Geddes.
Melba heard her sing aboard the boat on the
way from Honolulu to Maoriland, and
thought her voice good enough to train. A
young blonde, Dorothy Murdoch, has just
been awarded one of the scholarships.
A returned soldier, writing to rationed
mates oversea, enthused over this land of
plenty. “In Melbourne and Sydney,” he
said, “there is absolutely no scarcity of
anything —except, perhaps, tops to girls’
evening dresses.”
Amongst the ex-Australians who are work-
ing for the soldiers in England is Mrs.
Charlie Bridge, who was Georgina Westley
Hall, of Melbourne. She is the wife of
Major Charles Bridge, M.C., only son of
Brigadier-General Sir Charles Bridge.
Georgie has her share of good looks, and
has done many kindly acts for exiled Bill-
jim.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

Fortrait, winner of the Flying in record
time for the course at Rosehill a fortnight before,
annexed the same sort of event at Moorefield (Syd-
ney) on Saturday. This time he carried Bst. 61b.
On each occasion he beat a very fair field. Where-
fore it happens that the fact of Fortrait being bur-
dened with 7st. 21b. in the Epsom hasn’t escaped
attention. The probability of this nag seeing a
mile through is, of course,' only a matter of specu-
lation, but there seem no good reasons for being
doubtful. He is four years old. He has done six
furlongs twice without being winded. He is an
exceptionally smart beginner (an important matter
in an Epsom). He is a half-brother to Wolaroi, by
Flavus. He is a strong, well-turned animal. If
on form, conformation and breeding Fortrait hasn’t
a chance in the Epsom, then these things go for
nothing. Unhappily they often do.
* * * *
The Malster horse Amadis, owned by
Stirton, proprietor of Cetigne and Red Fox, was
produced a good deal above himself for the Flying
at Moorefield, carrying Bst. 31b. There was no rush
for him in the betting, and he didn’t rush very
expeditiously round the track. He finished sixth.
The point about all this is that Ainadis is favorite
for the Epsom (Bst.), and has been well backed for
the Metrop. and the Caulfield. He w 7 ould have won
if he could on Saturday, but because he didn’t will
be no reason for jumping at rash conclusions about
what he can do next time. After another month
or so will be time enough for Epsom trials.
* * * *
The tote was given its first run at a Syd-
ney horse-course free from competition by place-fielders
on Saturday. This was at Moorefield. The machine
turn-over took a big jump upward, reaching over
£ll,OOO. But the manner in which the business
was handled gives the club no cause to chant a
lay about the efficiency of the tote management.
There was muddle in getting the money on, undue
leisureliness in paying out and plentiful ringing up
of investments after starts —even after finishes.
Generally speaking the dividends w'ere fairly good:
but as the public undoubtedly wants a place tote,
how much longer is the Government going to be
making up its mind to get on a more rational basis
than 60, 20, 20? There is nothing to excuse per-
petuation of a system under which a backer gets
back less than he parted with. The thing is foolish-
ness carried to the last possible point.
* * * *
Some horse arithmetic: During the season
which ended last week 442 races were run on Syd-
ney metropolitan courses. These were captured
by 238 horses, of which 164 captured only one
apiece. There were 24 horses noticed in front on
more than two occasions. Winners of less than
£2OO numbered 111 and this page fears that unless
a nag wins a little more than that it isn’t a very
payable proposition at the end of 12 months. The
English bred winners numbered 18. They won 29
races. Maoriland supplied 9 winners. They took
18 times. Winners of over £lOOO numbered 28.
These had 60 wins. Averages: Maorilanders, £2967 ;
English, £2575; Australian, £2072. Aggregate:
£61,107. Some of last season’s winners will win
some more this year. A fairly substantial propor-
tion will never win again. Taken generally it can
be said that of the horses that actually win during
a racing season probably 50 per cent, have been
disappointments. If you add then to the crowd
which battle in the rear it looks as if the best
horse ought to be good enough for anyone —and
the chance of getting it about as big as the
lamented Buckley’s.
Three jumping horses offered for sale in
Melbourne last week had figured conspicuously among
the lights that failed. Bundong was Eric Connelly’s
“dead certainty” last winter, but he never was
quite good enough when the money was piled on
him. Then lie was sold to the Rajah, and had
apparently deteriorated into a duffer. King Movston
could never be depended on to run twice alike, but
he certainly made some amends to some of his
backers last winter when he won the Doutta Gal la
Hurdles at Flemington. Sir Prim, the third of the
trio, was educated for the hurdle business in his
early days. At first it seemed the experiment
would prove a success, and his bit of form as a
three-vear-old caused him to start first favorite, or
thereabouts, for. a Grand National. As he grew
older Sir Prim lost his dash.
* * * *
The wear and tear among Victorian jumping
horses this winter has been unusual, apart from which
the disappointments to punters were exceptionally
numerous. Nominations of well-known flat-racers for
hurdle events are always likely to mislead, but this
time a number of reasonable expectations came to
naught. Several approved jumpers with apparent
chances were missing from the National acceptances,
and by the time acceptances for the Australian
Hurdles came due only a dozen were left in. The
cast-iron Obi was among them. Jumpers come and
go, through misadventure or otherwise, but Obi battles'
on for ever. His record is amazing. Age has
brought the horse down in the weights, but in
ability to get over sticks he seems as strong as when
lie won the National eight years ago. His best
weight-carrying performance was in the big Caul-
field event of 1914, when he ran second to Capin-
testa, giving 391 b. to the winner and 341 b. to the
third horse. He seems to be the only nag left in
the business that claims Coil, long deceased, for his
sire.
Last Saturday at Caulfield was Fastolf's
day out, and he stayed longer than any of his 11
opponents in the Australian Hurdle. Also the natty
son of Bardolph had the advantage of Hugh Cairns
on his back, which counts considerably in a 31-
niile journey. He never was nearer than fourth
until they were approaching the last hurdle; then
he took the lead and won comfortably. Last year
the writer picked Fastolf for the National winner,
but one tires of believing in a nag that is always
having excuses offered for his respectable failures.
Although this particular failure invariably seemed
to be running on at the finish it looked as though
his want of devil was a fatal defect for first-class
hurdle-racing. But in a somewhat fast-run 31-mile
event his stamina pulled him through. The run-
ning of. Narahquong, the National surprise, justified
the popular theory that he is a “one-week” horse,
of the same class as Rathfarham, who romped away
with a National some years ago. On Saturday he
was rushed into the lead ere they had gone half a
mile, and stayed there for about two miles, after
which he steadily lost ground. Compared with his
performance of a month previous Narahquong’s run-
ning was bad, but his jumping was a pleasure. No
horse had jumped so joyously since the days of Leah
Kleshna. Kinlark had staled off more decidedly than
Westendale, who finished fourth behind Pistolier,
whilst the unduly-lean Rosyth was making an unex-
pected final effort to catch the winner. Youth had
a say in the finish. With one exception Fastolf was
the youngest horse in the field, Rosyth being one
of the next youngest. Nevertheless the two ancients
of the party, Obi and Wallalo, headed the proces-
sion round the turn for home, and looked quite likely
to have the finish to themselves. Three or four
years ago, under the same conditions they would
have had it to themselves, but on Saturday they
were decisively beaten in the straight run by old
Father Time. The crowd’s mighty shout of “Obi
wins!” sounded like an echo of the long ago. Like-
wise the rash assertion, “Wallalo’s home and dry!”
based on the recollection of his having won the
Australian Cup 4J years ago.
Lord Cecil, by winning the Steeplechasers' Flat,
paid for his trip from Sydney at first time of asking,
lie won it in champion style, too, covering a lot
more ground than any of the others in the last mile.
If he has quite shaken off the effects of a cold, and
gone on improving during the week, he should bear
his 12st. 711). to the fore in the Australian Steeple,
it promises to be fin interesting affair, after all. Old
Lord Grey showed himself fairly adept at the fences
by running second in the Steeplechase last Saturday,
and the trusty Cobram put in a good run behind
Lord'Cecil, who meets him on 111 b. worse terras in
the Steeple. And there are others. Anything might
win the four-miles race, but top-weight Cecil looks
most likely to be the animal.

For the 43rd time in as many years .T. .T.
Miller’s Sporting Annual comes as a reminder of the
big handicaps that bloom in the Spring. It used to be
called Sporting Pamphlet, but under any other
name it would be the same book of information. All
the performances to date of all the entrants for
Cups and handicaps are given, together with other
information relating thereto. As a text-book of
sporting records the Annual is a handy thing apart
from its horsey character. Three pages and two
photos at the end of the book are devoted to aviation,
a sport that was still in the clouds of prophecy when
.7. J. Miller, the Melbourne publisher, first began to
be a veteran.
* * * *
Sporting writer J. V. Henry, who put
Miller's Sporting Annual through the press this
year, is a young man with a passionate devotion to
accuracy. John’s private workshop, where he salts
down Australia’s horse-performances for , resurrection
when required, is more suggestive of a wholesale-
grocer’s invoicing department than a paragraphing
parlor. Henry has been pigeon-holing times and
places almost. since infancy, with the result that as
a horstatistician he is now notable even among the'
seasoned, hard-bitten elders of the business.
Plenty (Abundance —Style), the 5-year-old
lately bought in Sydney by Timmens, of Adelaide,
continues to win races when the company is not
too good. At the recent Broken Hill meeting he
did nothing, but at Tattersall’s July meeting in
Adelaide he got away with,the July Handicap, with
Bst. 311). A feature of the same afternoon was the
winning of the Juvenile Handicap by Tattersall’s
chairman, H. P. McLachlan. The colt was bred by
himself (Pistol-Nena Bell) and has been called

"Spreader”: The breeding of the Maori-
land ’chaser Master Strowan is interesting inas-
much as he is a direct descendant of Lochiel, whose
Prince Charlie blood will be priceless in a pedigree
a few years hence, when breeders are hunting round
for outcrosses. Strowan would have undoubtedly
given the Lochiel line a fresh start with anything
like decent chances, but the Poverty Bay district of
M.L. didn’t have the class of mares necessary. Yet
from Manutuki he got Pink ’Un, who ran consist-
ently over yonder and wound up as a
high-class performer on this side, Gatenbv
and Sir Daniel were both fair winners too.
Lochiel was got in England and foaled in 1882 in
Canterbury to English time, his dam Nelly Moore
being imported by G. G. Stead. Lochiel was a top-
hole racehorse. At the stud be was a great success,
but for some unaccountable reason bis name is gradu-
ally disappearing as each fresh edition of the stud
book appears.

“Trot”: It was in the Doncaster of ’9G
that the family arrived in a heap—Couralie (-T.
Delaney) 1, True Blue (A. Delaney) 2, Response (W.
Delaney) 3.
N. S. Wales St. Leger, the last “classic”
event of the coursing season was decided at Rooty
Hill last week-end. The entrants for the stake
numbered six. Despite defeat in the Thorne Stakes
the month before Bennett’s puppy Britling was favor-
ite, with Derby Lad next in demand. As was to be
expected this pair met in the final and Derby won
after a first-rate trial. This performance stamps
Derby Lad as the best puppy of the year. He was
unlucky to lose the Derby. Afterwards he won the
Produce Stakps at Liverpool. Britling put up the
more attractive performance. lie is a January
puppy and was the winner four months in age—a
very big handicap.
The Ladies’ Bracelet, also run at the same meeting,
brought out a field of 20. Aberfoys Beauty, the
favorite, was defeated in the first ties after having
run only moderately in the opening round. Wild
Arrow was then made favorite, and he reached the
deciding course only to be beaten pointless by
Bramble, a particularly smart puppy by Benediction
—All British, and consequently full sifter to Britling.
In fairness to Wild Arrow it must be mentioned that
before goin<r to the slips for the final he got into
an argument with another dog and finished with a
bitten foot. Bramble is owned by Bennett, of Booty
Hill, and is the best worker once she reaches the
hare seen thereabouts for many a day. She and
her full brother are the first of Benediction’s get to
chase hares publicly.

When no-side whistle blew on N. S. Wales
Rugby League premierships on Saturday South Syd-
ney barrackers raised tumultuous cheers of exul-
tation. The club had landed the first and third
grades and was runner-up to the unbeaten Glebe in
the second grade. The efforts of the first grade
team had two defeats —by Glebe and Western Sub-
urbs —but they rubbed their opponents to dust in
the other dozen matches. In competition points,
South piled up 257 against 121, the majority of 136
being easily the best among the eight clubs. Only
21 players were called on during the season. Since
the League got on its legs, South has won the
premiership in ’OB, ’O9, ’l4 and ’lB, and were
runners up in ’lO, ’l6, ’l7.
Of the individual players, Harold Ilorder’s
87 points for Souths (21 tries and 12 goals) was
the bulkiest score of the season. The flying three-
quarter played in 11 matches (out of 14), an(l in
all-round form easily stood on the top-rung of the
ladder. Other heavy point-raisers were A. Oxford
(Souths), 75; Frank Burge (Glebe), 72; A. McPher-
son (Western Suburbs), 02; A. B. Burge (Glebe),
58. Little McPherson’s tally of 31 goals was the
best foot effort for the past two years. The previous
best was Wally Messenger's 36 and C. Fraser’s 34 in
1815-16.
* * * *
Prince Alfred and St. Peter’s, Adelaide,
put aside their usual rivalry and got out a com-
bined football team against the University. The
’Varsity has never been first-class at the game. When
times were good the League refused it admission for
fear of damaging the district system, and of course
the war has knocked its team-strength heavily.
Probably it is no stronger than the better of the
schools. The combined teams won comfortably in
spite of some wretched shooting by 8 goals 20 behinds
to 6 goals 8 behinds. Adelaide Mail (27/7/’IS)
remarked that the play “showed that fulsome spirit
which the public schools everywhere breathe into
their students,” whatever that may mean.
Jim Mcßobb, of Hawthorn, put up a good
performance when he won the No. 19 Rifle Union
championship at Port Melbourne on July 27. He
notched 35, 32 and 34 at 500 600 and "700 yards
respectively, a total of 101 out of the possible 105
fpoints. A consistent and first-class marksman,
Meßobb, when not otherwise engaged, swings a pen
at* the Base Records Office.
‘W.J.H.” : S. M. J. Woods, who did good
service in Australia with bat and ball and after-
wards captained Somerset when he settled in the
Cold Country, has been playing well for England
in the Great Game. Though close up to 50 “Sammy”
left his comfortable job of secretarv to the club
three years ago and went as lieutenant to Egypt.
He saw active service on the desert and then
pushed on to France, where he was wounded twice
and won a captaincy. The veteran is now at Salis-
bury Plains Camp, looking after Billjim’s comfort.
Sammy is a son of the late John Woods, one-time
Sydney mayor and old pioneer of Manly.
* * * #
“Camel’s Hump”: Saw Charlie Candy, a
Bislev veteran, put up a string of 39 consecutive
10’s at the Prahran (Vic.) miniature range last
week. This is a good performance, but falls far
short of A. J. Dalton’s 67. A steady hand, sure
eye- and kindly-disposed liver are the essentials for
these endurance feats. Talking of Bisley, Candy
tells a yarn about the late Earl Roberts. A great
sticker for riflemen generally, “Bobs” was a keen
supporter of the Britis# team. In the Kolapore Cup
the Australians had 20 shots to go,and could afford to
drop only two points to tie. “I think we have got you
beaten this time,” remarked Roberts to a Tasmanian
member of the Aussie team. “You well wait
and see,” was the startling answer. When the boys
from down-under made a dead heat of it, the old man
had a laugh and another jeke to tell against himself.
* * * *
“Wandewoi” : These war correspondents
are simple, refined souls. Hamilton Fyfe, in the
Datly Mail, lately described two-up in an article
under the appealing title, “Soldiers at Play”:—
“Yesterday I was among the Australians, and came
across many groups playing their favorite game,
which consists in tossing two coins and seeing
whether they fall on the ground alike or different.”
All our “sway up” artists have become polite since
that appeared.
* * * *
Some of our Aussie farriers are still
blaspheming about it. We “took over’.’ in
January from a “Woodbine” (Tommy) outfit, and
while inspecting the camp saw a corporal-farrier
put the hot shoe on the “floor” and then carefully
put the moke’s hoof on it in order to fit same. Our
farrier nearly dropped dead. Yet the Woodbines
tell us we don’t know how to handle “bronks,” and
can’t ride.
* * * *
“Con D.”: When Jim brought a deck of
cards to light Bill’s face lit up like the door of a
coke-oven. “I’ll poker yer,” he said. “Poker me?”
growled Jim. “We ain’t got no money. What can
we play for?” “Sand,” said Bill. “We’ll play for
grains of Abdul’s sand.” The cards were dealt and
each took up his hand. “It’s up to you to bet,”
muttered Jim. “What yer goin’ to do?” “Oh, I’ll
bet a million,” said Bill carelessly. “Good!” said
Jim. “I’m hoisting it a billion.” Bill made a
mental calculation and bounced it up to a trillion.
Then Jim threw in his hand. “You’ve got me beat
on the flamin’ addition,”, lie sighed. “That's
best of havin’ a good education.”
* * * . *
“Q." : “Surat's” attitude towards the feats
quote'd by, “Pick” and myself leads me to suspect
him of being a mule. But 1 want “CC” (B
l/S/’IS) to understand that my pa didn’t use a cut
cartridge in accomplishing his performance, he havin'-
tried that recipe and found it harmful. At some
stage in the ascending scale of guns we must reach
a weapon which represents perfection—that is a gun
oil which the greatest efforts and the utmost know-
ledge and wisdom of the maker have been exerted
to produce an instrument of the highest value and
efficiency. I have calculated that this stage is
reached in a gun costing about £lO or £ls° All
money above this sum is paid for things which are
superfluous to a gun’s efficiency—call them what you
like, materials or ornamentation, for they all relate
to appearance, convenience and endurance. The
finer material in a costly gun cannot affect its
shooting powers. No one except “Nimrod” (B.
l/8/’IS) would expect a gun .to kill any better after
the addition of ejecting locks costing £lO than it
would without them.
* * * *
“Mopoke”: llow many of the artillery
experts who assassinate ducks' at 100yds. ha\*e
handled a muzzle-loading gun capable of firing four
shots without reloading? Well, J. P. Williams, of
Wingham (N.S.W.) has one—a double-barrelled im-
plement with four hammers, two on each side, con-
trolled by two triggers. The charges are put on top
o-f each other with a thick felt wad between, ami
the mechanical arrangement of the triggers prevents
the back charge being fired until the front one has
gone. The gun is by an English maker and was
designed in the days when a man’s freed.om was
measured by the length of his leg-iron. It was
owned by the skipper of one of the old-time ships
that used to ply between England and Australia
with loads of humanity. This craft was eventually
wrecked off Port Stephens, and the skipper anil
crew landed and reached Stroud in a very emaciated
condition. They were taken in and cared for by
John Williams, grandfather of the present owner of
the gun, who ministered to their wants, and in return
the skipper made him a present of the battery.
The top charge fires all right; but an emu isn’t in it
with tlje kick when the stern ammunition is switched
on.
* # * *
“Pick”: A well-trained setter makes all
the sport in a quail-killing expedition. His sagacity
and eagerness are beautifully interesting. With long
loping bounds he traverses the grassy fields, to and
fro across the guns, with tail busily awag and
nose up greedily sniffing the air. As the scent
comes best, down wind, to give the sport a show the
work should be against the. breeze. The marvel is
that other ground birds or animals have no attrac-
tion for the setter; but immediately the scent of
distant quail is crossed, nose and. tail become stiffly
horizontal, and he- narrows his - ground of search
until he sets rigidly over the covey. Then he squats
out of the way of shot as the guns appear over
his back, and rises again only to join in search for
the wounded and slain. In a hundred acres of stubble,
with one quail and a good dog, a bad shot can have
the day’s enjoyment of a lifetime; but with plenty
of game and deadly shots there’s rather too much
murder about the business.
“0.R.”: Anybody going to an Australian
camp in England can pick the national gamble of
the Aussies in one. But they don’t seem to know
much about it over yonder. One day at Warminster
there was a big school going in the middle of the
road and the local Hops reckoned that headin’
’em was not within the meaning. Anyway, they didn’t
interfere, which may have been just as well. At
every camp school goes in early and comes out late.

The Denby is able to use a smaller motor and save you fuel expense,
because the power losses with the internal-gear axle are so much
less than with any other form of drive.
The only power you are interested in is the usable power delivered
at the wheels. And Denby delivers its greatest power at the slower
speeds, when the load is heavy or the road rough.
That is only one of a score of points of Denby dominance

He swore it wasn’t that at all,
And in reply as to what it was

“Pint Pot”: The report of the British
Liquor Control Board for 31)17-18 lias set
the Cold Country wowser thinking furiously.
Before the war a couple of private cos.
founded by Earl Grey (now deceased) and
the Anglican Gaiters of Chester had started
“reform public-houses,” from which private
profit was eliminated, the managers getting
no commission on the sale of booze; but
“the trade” and the Cold Tea crowd com-
bined against them, and they had to light
both interests every time they tried to
acquire a licensed house. The Liquor Con-
trol Board, with compulsory-purchase power
behind it, dodged that trouble from the star!,
and tried the “reform” policy in two muni-
tion-making areas —Carlisle and Enfield. 111
the former it took over all the pubs. Liquor
advts, both inside and outside, were abol-
ished and plain-curtained windows were sub-
stituted for garish bottle displays. Next,
tlie paternal Board tried to teach the Car-
lisle soaker not to mix his drinks. His
favorite tipple, had been “dog’s-nose”—
whisky or gin neat, with beer as a “chaser.”
The Board refused to take any order for
spirits and beer to he served together. It
didn’t keep Carlisle quite sober; but for the
most part it kept it sober enough to avoid
being lumbered. In 1916, the last year of
Pte. Enterprise’s reign, there were 953 con-
victions for drunkenness; in 1917, under the
Board’s control, only 320 drunks were con-
victed. At Enfield four pubs near the small-
arms factory were taken over and turned
into wet canteens, in which the supply of
meals, washed down with “Government ale,”
is the main business. The four canteens can
servo 1000 cheap meals in 10 minutes, and
are open all night to suit men coming off
shift at. various times. The people who are
trying to foist prohibition on Australia
under war-time camouflage never mention
the Carlisle and Enfield experiments.


STOPAIN
A BOON TO MOTHERS.
After much thought and experiment
we have at last succeeded in completing
what we believe is the most successful
treatment known for toothache. We
have placed it on the market under the
name of
STOPAIN
A Toothache Gum.
Besides being the latest and most
successful treatment for toothache,
Stopain is both simple and economical,
It is in the form of a gum and all you
have to do is to fill the cavity of the
tooth with it. It excludes the air and
stops toothache immediately.
No more burnt gums or blistered
tongues by liquid “cures” and this
alone means a lot to mothers.
Not only does Stopain relieve the pain,
but it also assists to preserve the tooth
until dental aid can be obtained, thus
making it invaluable to families in the
country who are often a day’s journey
from the nearest dentist.
Stopain is a boon to mothers. No
home, should be without Stopain ; it is so
convenient and never fails to bring relief.
Stopain has been tried bv thousands of
people and we have never yet known it
to fail when used according to directions.
Get it now for you never know when it
may be needed.
Stopain is sold by most retailers at Is.
per box, but if yours hasn’t got it in
stock it will be sent, to any address
postage paid, upon receipt of price by
SUNSET DRUG CO.,
Cr. Goodlet & Rilev Streets, Sydney.

Weakness
Every movement of the
body uses up a definite
amount of vitality. That
is why you feel tired at
the end of the day. When
you overtax yourself, or
when your vitality is
undermined by illness,
your whole system be-
comes too exhausted to
recover its lost vitality
without assistance. Your
system is like a plant that
is drooping for want of
water. And just as water
revives a drooping plant—
so ‘Wincarnis’ gives new
life and new vitality to a
weakened constitution.
Because I Wincarnis ’ pos-
sesses a four-fold power.
It is a Tonic, a Restora-
tive, a Blood-maker and
a nerve Food—all in one.
Therefore
iTr
The Wine of Life
creates new strength, new
blood, new nerve force,
and new vitality. The
benefit begins from the
first wineglassful. You
can feel it doing you
good. You can feel every
wineglassful giving you
more strength than you
had before, and surcharg-
ing your whole system
with new vitality. That
is why over 10,000 Doctors
recommend ‘Wincarnis.’

The Conquest
of PAIN
by Natural Heat
THE throbbing of a cut finger is due
to the fact that Nature’s inner
warmth sends an extra stream of
healing, soothing blood to the seat of the
trouble —and the pain soon ceases.
With a continuous ache or pain—Rheu-
matism for instance—the blood is
congested, and natural heat must be gener-
ated to stimulate vigorous circulation.
Thermogene develops the inner warmth of
the natural forces deep in the tissues, with
the result that a healing, soothing, pain-
banishing stream of blood is drawn
directly to the affected part.
Thermogene conquers pain. It thrills
the blood and makes it tingle with new
life. Thus congestion is cleared and in
place of pain the erstwhile sufferer enjoys
a sense of soothed tranquillity.
Theremogene is easy to apply, easy to
keep applied, always beneficial. As suit-
able for children as adults. Thermogene
is sold at all chemists at 1/6 per box.
Look for the familiar Orange-colored
Boxes in the Chemists’ Windows.
Thermogene is and always
has been a product of
British and Allied ownership,
production and management.
Write for the illustrated book on the
Thermogene treatment, which tells how to
get the best results. Send a postcard to-day

The Czar, whose life hasn’t looked like a
good insurance risk for .quite a while, is
dead at last, unless he comes to life again,
and his son, aged 14, has quickly followed
him. The boy’s death is set down to “expo-
sure,” which suggests that he was of a deli-
cate constitution, for George Reid was ex-
posed every time he made a financial state-
ment and is still alive. People of course
draw the familiar parallel between Nicholas
11. and Louis XVI., but though it is good
enough so far as it goes the story isn’t
completq yet. The real parallel case goes
like this: —
King beheaded (Charles I. of England; Louis XVI. of
France).
Temporary Governments (Long Parliament, Kump
Parliament, Convention Directory).
Strong Military Boss (Cromwell; Napoleon).
Period of Temporary Muddle (Second Protectorate
and short-lived Republic in England; first
Restoration, and Hundred Days in France).
Restoration of Middle-aged King who came back
from exile with one fixed idea—that he “didn’t
want to go on his travels again” (Charles II.;
Louis XVIII.).
Succeeded by foolish, elderly, bigoted brother who
had also been in exile but had learned nothing.
Bigoted brother wrecked himself by trying to
restore the old powers and properties of the
Church (James 11. ; Charles X.).
And each time the dynasty lost its job for good.
Though Louis Philippe carried it on for a while in
France and Anne in England they werte only side-
lines, so to speak.
The present war has also furnished a paral-
lel. Twice the Iluns got almost in sight of
Paris. Each time the Crown Hun Prince
was in command. Each time Foch was
waiting, though he wasn’t in supreme com-
mand the first time. And the unlucky Marne
was where the Hun got cold wet feet on both
occasions.
“Elong”: The first public tramway in
N. S. Wales was opened in December, 1861,
from Redfern station to Circular Quay along
Pitt-street. The rails were an inconveni-
ence to ordinary traffic, and the whole sys-
tem proved unsatisfactory, so it was removed
in ’66. Two more attempts were made to
introduce tramways, one in ’73, the other in
’77. The proposal of ’77 hung fire until ’79,
when it was decided to build a line from
IR'dfern station to Hunter-street (one mile
45 chains) for the conveyance of people to
the International Exhibition. Four steam-
motors and six cars were brought out from
America, and these were the foundation of
the present system. In December, ’B5, 271
miles of line was in working order under
steam power. North Shore line was opened
in ’B6 and Watson’s Bay line in ’94, both
being worked by the cable system owing to
the steep grades. The North Shore line was
extended from Falcon-street to Spit-road on 1
September 20, ’93, where the first electric
service in Australia was run.
“Cleveland”; There’s some fine comic-
opera material in the naval records of Tunis.
Some years ago the Navy consisted of four
old steam vessels, a tug or two, seven admi-
rals, 23 captains, a bunch of lieutenants and
12 sailors. But the splendid fighting force
was lost to the nation in one smash. On
the occasion of a big review at Malta the
fleet was despatched to take part, but the
admiral commanding, after cruising about
the Mediterranean for six weeks without be-
ing able to fin-d Malta, decided that that
speck had subsided beneath the ocean; so
he made the coast of Tripoli, sold the squad-
ron and settled down. He is probably the
only man in the Tunisian army or navy who
ever got level with the pay-roll. But, though
the ships and men had vanished, the navy
and its personnel still existed on paper and
was provided for as usual in the estimates.
Tunis also had its politicians.
Quentin Roosevelt, son of the ex-Presi-
dent, who was reported to have been killed
in an aeroplane fight in France, the other day,
is the fourth in the family to shoulder a gun
for Uncle Sam. Two of his brothers are now
in France, whilst the eldest is doing special-
ist work with a British unit in Mesopo-
tamia. A married sister is serving in an
American hospital near the Ifront, and her
doctor hubby is patching up damaged Sam-
mies near by. The Roosevelts have been an
inspiring example to the small village that
clusters around the family mansion at
Oyster Bay. Before the operation of the
draft, Oyster Bay took the prize for enlist-
ment throughout the U.S.
“Dale” : Ever thought that the battle-line
which runs across France and Belgium must
have a beginning and an end? I understand
that it starts right up against the Swiss bor-
der fence and, at the other end, barb-wire
runs out into the sea. Two coves, or maybe
blokes, must face each other at either ex-
tremity as the absolute first and the absolute
last. Any returned Billjim acquainted with
the localities?
This country has house prices (the build-
ing of houses has nearly ceased, because the
business has ceased to be payable), wheat
prices (they are very low, and the N. S.
Wales crop of 2| years ago isn’t fully paid
for yet), and meat prices (sheep wholesale
at Adelaide, 6d. per lb.; scrag neck of mut-
ton retail, 5d.). Now if interest prices'were
fixed all would be well. It seems an outrage
that N. S. Wales should pay for the mere
lease of money in London as much as six
or six-aud-a-quarter, while the adjacent State
gets scrag mutton in fee simple at a point-
less.
It is not often that a school becomes
quarry-owner, but that is what St. Peter’s
College in Adelaide has done. The hills near
by are full of first-class stone, and the school,
contemplating extensive additions, has bought
on the wholesale scale. The material is
much the same as that used long ago in
building the G.P.0., Supreme Court and
Town Hall. Alfred Wells is the architect,
and the contractor is Torode, who built the
Elder Conservatorium and the Cathedral
Towers.
“Moobitta”: What shall we do with our
insufficiently-covered wheat-stacks? Easy. As
the parsons are everlastingly complaining
that the churches are empty, I suggest that
all cathedrals, tabernacles and chapels be
used as granaries, until this world gets
straight again. No Christian worth the
name would object, and a term in the open
air would improve the health of the congre-
gations.

Miss DUDLEY LINDSAY, a charming Rexona Girl (from a photo).
Dear Sirs, —I am sending
you my photograph, as
I want to join your Rexona

I am truly one. I have
been using your Rexona
and Rexona Soap now for
over a year, and consider
them both excellent. I
have found Rexona most
healing and a wonderful
skin remedy.
Rexona Soap is cer-
tainly quite unsurpassed

Soap. I think it is simply
delightful, and would
never consider ever using
any other kind again. 1

Rexona Wrappers, which
I have taken from the
Soap, and wish you would

your Bubble Pipes, which
I notice you advertise to
give with each three Wrap-
pers from Rexona Soap

I hear that Rexona Soap
is now the most used of
any Soap in Australia, and
t am sure it deserves to
be.
Yours truly (Sgd.)

The Wander Men.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BEAR swirl of deep-sea water —the
skyline breaking blue
Where Distance takes the heart-
strings and leads beyond our ken,
By road of prow and counter and lash of
driving screw,
We quest toward the outroads where walk
the wander-men.
Swing high ! dip low ! the brown spars lurch !
the crossheads creak and strain ;
A song is in the funnel stays! the halliards
wail and hum;
The winds climb through the open rails and
lift the tune again;
The tall waves rush to welcome us, hoarse-
shouting as they come.
For we are for the outroads, where all is
strong and clean;
The noise of town is from our ears—the dust
is off our feet,
And we have emptied all our hearts of
vicious things and mean,
That smirch the robes of Commerce, within
the murky street.
For us the wide blue sea-way, the arch of
wider sky,
And stalwart airs that gallop through with
music in their note;
The shouting of the waters and the gulls
that wheel and cry,
And laughter springing from the heart into
an open throat.
Girl with the love within your eyes, the
woman in your face,
We wander-men may love you well yet
never can we bide
When love would bind our beating hearts
within a narrow place
What time within our ears we hear the call-
ing of the tide.
The singing of the big-sea drift, the ground-
er’s roar and race,
The music of the open where the currents
twine and swirl,
The swift white kiss of deep-sea rain that
lingers on the face.
All these are cleanly manly things that prove
our manhood, girl!
Soft snow-white fingers frail enopgh to hold
me to the shore!
Sweet scented love-chains strong enough to
hold me from the sea!
Girl, I who love your womanhood must wor-
ship manhood more,
And go to fuller consecrate the man you love
in me.
Yet oh ! the flying, crying gulls swift-wheel-
ing in our wake.
The drifting spray like bitter tears upon the
weary sight
Each speaks the word of loneliness, and that
a heart may break —
O maiden heart, I seem to hear a sobbing in
the night!
But head seas and heavy seas break wildly
o’er the dream;
Green waters in the scuppers threshing white
to hissing foam!
We challenge all the strength of sea and
spurn it with our beam,
While one by one we break the bonds that
bind our hearts to home.
W e’re driving toward the outer earth where
wander-men must go!
Sing hey ! the merry song, my lads, the gale
is piping hard;
We meet the mad might of the world and
give it blow for blow,
And headlong smash against the sea and win
it, yard by yard.
Dear swirl of deep-sea water —dear beat of
white-sea rains!
We wander-men will greet you well upon the
lonely ways,
For we can feel the wander-thrill within our
pulsing veins.
And seek to live a stronger life more worth
a woman’s praise.
By strength of hand and depth of heart
we’ll quest the outer track
And search the inmost soul of Life till it be
understood;
Then, singing from the splendid seas the
wander-men come back
To proffer perfect manhood for your perfect
womanhood.
AT SEA.
BOYCE BOWDEN.
A Black Plot.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN Mat Conyers wasn’t breaking
his neck after a girl, or brooding
over an ungracious charmer he
had wooed and lost, he was a satisfactory
mate. But these abnormal periods never
lasted long, except when he was on the drov-
ing track; and even this work did not always
keep his heart aloof from feminine influ-
. .. f _
ence. A pretty face or an attractive figure
seemed to work on him as rapidly as an
electric battery. His mate called it girlitis.
They were half-way through a trip from
Logan Valley to Ramornie when a girl rode
f , „ , .. . . . , . ,
® nt l f ron i J a selection to inquire about her
brother Bob, who d gone across the border
r\° f ' 10 . rSe , S - wa ? not
° L bush, but she was nice. Conyers
cfiildn t tell her anjdhing about Bob ; but
when she had gone he told his mate there
i\as good picking near her father s place, and
‘. iey . , K,r f, es t l iei ’ e r, on ,^i e
wa\ ba_c . 1 roughout the he rode
around in an abstracted mood. At times he
mentally lost the cattie, and when he woke
"A;ciilri „“ alon * . At night
L airS an
sang them songs of love; but he didn t care
to talk
' Next day he ascertained from Jim the mail-
man that her name w T as Charlotte Pine.
When the mob had been delivered, Conyers,
with rebellious company pacing far behind
him. made record time back to the beautiful
bend near Pine’s selection. After they had
pitched their tent and made a fire Mat
strolled off up to the house to ask permission
to camp there. He came back near* midnight
in a happy mood, and raised the ire of Murty
Brown by singing softly to the blankets.
“Y’ ought to take that voice outside an
scrape it,” Mr. Brown complained as he
turned grumpily away from it.
For the first time in their travels together
Conyers willingly did all the horse-hunting.
He went hunting early in the morning; he
strolled forth again soon after mid-day, and
he sallied out once more at sundown. His ex-
ertions were not confined to their own horses.
Seeing Charlotte steering for her docile
moke, he fell through the fence in his rush to
help her. The moke was dozing under a
tree, but woke up suddenly and moved away,
and when Conyers ran to block him he shook
his head and trotted down to the bottom
corner. Mat ran after him. He ran after
him for half an hour, by which time the
rogue had got back to where he started from.
Mat hurried up, breathing like a winded
sheep and wiping perspiration from his eyes.
Then Charlotte held out her hand, saying,
‘‘lverp, kerp!” at which he whinnied softly
and walked up to her.
“I could have done that at first if you’d
kept away,” she informed the perspiring
Conyers.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” he humbly pro-
tested.
“You hunted him away,” she said, a laugh
in her eyes; “so I had to wait till you hunted
him back.”
The incident made Conyers feel small.
When he returned to camp and saw Murty
looking unusually happy, he felt worse.
“Long Alex. Raven was here awhile ago,”
said Murty, kicking the fire together.
“Oh ! An’ what’s he got to talk about?”
“Said he could catch Charlotte’s hack any-
where, an’ was laughin’ like a big boy at a
circus.”
“He had a fat lot to laugh at,” Conyers
snarled, and dived into the tent, where he
began to put a fresh polish on his boots,
which the grass had scraped bare.
“He’ll just be in time to escort her down
to the mail track,” Murty threw after him.
“Have you seen the mokes anywhere?”
Conyers asked, as if he wasn’t worrying
about anything else.
“Oh, they’re all right,” said Murty, easily.
“The long ’un said he’d turn them back if be
saw them past the house. He knew you’d be
tired.”
“Pity he couldn’t mind his own business,”
Conyers growled.
Throwing the brushes down he got his
bridle and set off with the long, firm stride
of a man who was going to do something.
Ahead of him he spied a black gin, saunter-
ing along the creek with a dilly-bag slung
over her head. At once an idea came to him,
and he set after her at full speed. Overtaking
her near the crossing, he produced a shilling,
which, after a short confab, he put back in
his pocket. Then the gin sat down at the
crossing, while Conyers planted himself in a
thicket near by.
They had been there half an hour when
long Alex, and the girl came riding back. As
the pair emerged from the creek the gin stood
up with a delighted grin of recognition on her
face.
“Hulloa, Alex.!” she exclaimed. “Where
you been this long time?”
Alex, bent a searching, withering look
upon her as he passed.
“Ugh !” said the gin. “You pflash pfeller
now.”
Alex.’s heels were digging into the horse’s
sides, but he did not speak.
“My word!” the gin called after him,
“plenty you been gib it blanket ’fore you
catch um white Mary.”
The girl looked at her escort with inquir-
ing, horrified eyes.
“The black cow!” muttered Alex. “I never
saw her in my life before.”
“Strange how she knows you,” Charlotte
said in frigid tones.
“She doesn’t know me,” Alex, protested.
“She’s mistaken me for someone else. Don’t
mind her.”
Charlotte sat more upright than usual and
looked straight ahead. Alex. w r as anxious to
get away from the unpleasant subject.
“Th’ dance is on at Harry Batten’s new
house to-morrow night,” he reminded her.
“I’ll call for you”
“Don’t bother ; I’m not going,” she broke
in, speaking in a strangely hard voice. She
shook up her mount and galloped away.
Raven, after watching her awhile, slewed
sharply round and rode back to the crossing,
where he searched up and down muttering
execrations. Finding no one, he departed in
a ferment of explosive wrath.
The gin’s head appeared above a bunch of
ferns as Conyers cautiously emerged from
under a bush.
“My word, saucy pfelMh that one,” the
gin remarked.
Conyers, looking pleased, tossed a shilling
to her, saying as he did so : “You git now,
quick feller.”
Such good use was made of the next 24
hours that Conyers inspected the new resi-
dence, chummed up with Harry Batten, got
an invitation to the dance, obtained an in-
terview with Charlotte and prevailed on her
to go with him.
It was a house-warming, and everybody
in the neighborhood had a part in it. Long
Alex, was among them, lonely and grim-
looking. Mat Conyers, immensely proud of
his new girl, paraded her before vengeful
eyes and talked sentimental incoherencies
into her pink ear. Several aborigines who
had been attracted to the entertainment hung
about the doors and windows. Murty was a
bored spectator—until supper was ready,
when he became an animated participator.
Up to this point Conyers had been moving
in an earthly paradise. He had monopolised
the buxom Charlotte nearly all the evening,
and was definitely matched with her in the
opinions of all the old people present.
Strolling out on to the verandah together
immediately after supper, he and Charlotte
encountered a black gin. with a chubby pic-
caninny waddling about her.
“This one Matty,” volunteered the picca-
ninny’s mother, as she drew the kid tardily
out of the w r ay. “Little pfeller Mat.”
Charlotte stopped short and looked down
with sudden suspicion at the dirty-nosed
toddler. “Why do you call him that?” she
asked.
The gin lqughed and nodded towards
Conyers. “I been name him after Mat Con-
yers.” she said. “Him father belonga this
one.”

Remarkable ZAM-BUK Cure,
NO more remarkable triumph over
Eczema in its worst form has (
been reported than that of (
the case of Mrs. J. Richardson, of j
9 Cowell Street, Fitzroy, Melbourne, |
who says :—“ I suffered dreadfully
from weeping eczema in its worst
form. The disease appeared in the form
of little blisters, which spread into one
another until the whole of my body was
red-raw. The irritation was awful, and
seemed to get worse day by day. I was
confined to bed for some time and the burn-;
ing torture then became terrible.
“Then I remembered hearing about
Zam-Buk’s value for eczema, so began to
use this balm. Zam-Buk was a blessed
relief from the first moment it was applied.
It was most soothing and cooling to my
fiery skin. The irritation ceased, and
Zam-Buk drew all the moisture out and
dried up the disease-stricken surface. It
is wonderful how soon the eczema was
completely healed.
“I have also used Zam-Buk for my
thumb when I severed the top joint of it
whilst chopping wood. The injury was
dressed by a doctor, and I afterwards used
Zam-Buk, which healed my thumb very
quickly. We have always found Zam-Buk
splendid.”

Mrs. RICHARDSON
For the successful treatment of
most forms of Eczema nothing
can be recommended with greater
confidence than Zam-Buk. Zam-
buk has cured completely hun-
dreds of apparently hopeless
cases of Eczema. Apply Zam-Buk by
spreading' the balm on a piece of clean
lint cut to about the size of the affected
area; and then bring the lint gently
over the place and keep there till it is
desired to renew the dressing. Applica-
tions of the balm first soothe the red,
angry skin surfaces, enabling the patient
to enjoy anew all the blessings of
restful sleep. Continued dressings keep
down, and, in the end, entirely dispel
the awful itching and burning inflamma-
tion, and by degrees stop all mattering,
clear away the scabs and pimples, and
promote the growth beneath of fresh
layers of healthy skin.

Charlotte recoiled as though she had been
stung. Conyers was too thunderstruck to
speak. His mouth gaped and he went red
and white by turns. Accepting these signs
for guilt, the girl turned away disdainfully
and rustled back to the dance-room.
Conyers eyed her stiffened back in blank
dismay, conscious that the brand that had
been dabbed on him would be hard to wipe
oil'. Then he turned in spluttering rage to
force the accuser to undo the mischief; but
the gin had discreetly slipped away. It was
useless trying to find her.
The music recommenced indoors. Conyers
moved round to the back to look for Itaven.
lie learned that the lonesome one had gone
home. Conyers went round the house and
got to the front in time to see Charlotte
going away with her arm linked in Murty
Krown’s. lie stared in amazement for a
moment, then propped his back against a
post and twisted his moustache reflectively.
There was nothing sentimental about
Murty; but as Conyers was a great man
with the girls, according to his talk, and
had belittled him so often, Murty felt a
touch of pride on finding himself in posses-
sion of Charlotte. He was not fascinated ;
only flattered. He resolved to make the
best of his advantage, just to show his cobber
what he could do when he liked. It would
take some of the conceit out of him. Murty
explained to Charlotte Pine that Matthew
was a positive disgrace, lie was ashamed
of him.
Conyers mooched dejectedly camp
alone. The fact that Murty Brown had
stepped into the girl’s good graces he re-
garded as more favorable to himself than
otherwise—until that interloper returned to
camp. Murty came with beaming face, sug-
gesting that he had been having a good
time. He peered into his pocket-mirror for
a space before undressing, while remarking
that he’d been invited up to tea at the
Pines’ place on the following evening. lie
chiacked Mr. Conyers in a pleasant way, and
generally acted as if a great happiness had
suddenly befallen him. Conyers went to bed
in a sullenly distracted frame of mind.
In the morliing Murty shaved himself,
scrubbed his blackened teeth with powdered
charcoal and cleaned his boots. He was pro-
ceeding to brush his best suit, when Con-
yers, in exasperation, left the camp. He
rambled over hills and valleys into a virgin
tract that was inhabited only by blacks.
When he returned he looked as if the walk
had greatly improved his constitution and
brightened his outlook on life.
Murty left at sundown, first advising Con-
yers not to sit up for him, as he expected to
be late. Mat - grinned mysteriously as he
stooped to lift the billy off the fire.
Tea was ready at the Pines’ house when
Murty arrived. An inquiry appertaining to
his mate’s location opened the way for some
scurrilous remarks concerning people who
kept such disreputable company as long
Alex. Raven and Mat Conyers appeared to
have been doing. Mr. Pine expressed strong
views upon the matter. Pie said that if such
a low white as Conyers came into his house
he would regard the premises polluted
thereby. Miss Pine, who had made some
tasty scones and patty cakes for the occasion,
was graciously attending on the guest when
there came a knock. She opened the door,
and to her disgust was confronted by an
ugly gin, who was accompanied by seven
half-caste youngsters.
“Good-night,” said the black. “Is Mr.
Brown here?”
“Ye-es,” Charlotte answered, staring at
her.
“I want to see him,” said the visitor. “I’m
Missus Brown.”
“Wha-at!” gasped Charlotte, stepping back.
“Mr. Brown’s wife?”
“Yowie.”
Charlotte drew a long breath and rushed
in to her mother. There was a long, brisk
conversation in shocked undertones, and then
Mrs. Pine acted quickly. She brought the
gin and the pics, to the dining-room, and
broke up the blissful serenity therein with
the abrupt announcement: "“This woman
says she’s Murty Brown’s wife!”
“That’s. right,” the gin asserted, meeting
the astonished looks of the two men with a
broad smile. “Pie marry me long time ago,
an’ all about piccaninny here belonga him.”
“Well, by ci'ipes!” gasped Murty.
Mr. Pine, recovering from his stupefaction,
waved his hands and roared : “Clear them out
o' this ! The idea o’ bringin’ them in here ! Be
off with you !” He leaped up, and clutching
Murty by the collar lifted him out of the
chair. “You, too, you d —d hypocrite! Out
you go!’’
“You keep your hands to yourself!” Murty
remonstrated. “There’s no cause to get
excited.”
“Get out!” Mr. P’ine yelled at him. “Go
an’ catch ’possums.”
Murty protested loud and indignantlv, but
Mr. Pine shoved him into the night and shut
the door. Murty made some caustic com-
ments on the character of Mr. Pine and
plodded back to camp, muttering and scowl-
ing as he went.
“Ilulloa!” said Conyers, who was sewing
on buttons. “Doesn’t take long to spend an
evening at Pines’?”
Murty threw his hat into a corner and
proceeded with unwonted deliberation to
rearrange his bedding. “We’ll be movin’ on
at daylight,” he announced when he had
finished. “There’s too many out-o’-work
blacks about this vicinity.”
EDWARD S. SORENSON.
The Popular Girl.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I SUPPOSE it is a good thing to have a
reputation of some sort to live up to,
but I am dead weary of mine. I am
the Popular Girl. It was a ghastly line to
take up, but, not being remarkable for any-
thing, I soon realised it was The Only
Way for me. And now you can’t teach
me anything about bores. I know them all,
plain and colored. At any sort of gather-
ing to which I am bidden on account of
my one alleged attraction, I am certain to
see the hostess make a bee-line in my direc-
tion with some old blighter clinging round
her. And then my fate is sealed. For the
rest of the evening I am a stodge factory
working overtime, trying to fill it up with
conversation it will understand. And just
when I am listening to the inevitable recital
of its drab youth, I see one of those big,
dark, blackguard-looking men, whose eye-
play seems to fairly rip the tissue-paper off
your soul, leaning against a French window
that simply sighs, “Oh, be sensibly foolish
and come out into the garden!” But you
can’t —you are so good-natured, confound
you for an idiot; so you go on feeding the
blazing bore with scraps and tatters of small
talk, and raking out the ashes of the past.
There are times when I want to get up and
yell and kick out blindly. Then I remember
my star part, and go on doing awful things
with my face, trying to look interested.
When I go away for a change, I always
seem to strike the home when the family is
having an influenza carnival and the poor
red-faced baby is attending to its first lot of
dentistry. Then, of course, there is only one
thing for it. I simply have to love sick-
nursing, and doing the four-step with a fren-
zied infant on cold waxy lino in the watches
of the night is just what I have always
wanted to experience.
I have one or two admirers. They don’t
want to marry me, you know —I am just the
good sort and a real sport—and they are
all safely married. But they are awfully
good at holding my hand very tightly when
they say good-night, and telling me that
anything they can do for me—anything at
all, murdering and picture-hanging not
excepted—l have only to call on them or
send them a post-card. Such devotion
makes me feel quite light-headed, and they
are so fatherly and protecting that one less
stricken in years might be tempted to lay a
powdered cheek on their shoulders (one
shoulder at a time) and give them the shock
of their lives. Sometimes I do want to con-
fide in them, but then they back-pedal and
get behind their certificates, and babble
weakly about “my wife.” Cowards! It’s
funny, but they always seem to slop over
like that when you know you are looking
nicer than usual. No man yearns to be a
big strong brother to a girl with the wrong
sort of dress or a scraggy neck—it wouldn’t
come natural to him.
I am tired of reading, but as I can’t get
round to many of the shows I have to collect
some sort of fuel for light conversation. I
find that if I try to talk books, they offer
me a cigarette with the hope that I will for-
get it. I don’t like smoking—it makes me
deadly ill—but it is Something To Do, and
helps to indicate to him that he needn’t jamb
on the brakes, pull up at the home signal
and whistle. Unfortunately the cigarette
often seems to give them the idea that they
can now run express the rest of the dis-
tance, or hand me an after-dinner story. I
just loathe after-dinber stories, but you have
to learn to giggle when your spine seems
about to shrink.
I did meet a nice man lately—he unfolded
from a huge chair in a secluded corner, and
we were having a real I-think-I-must-have-
met-you-in-another-life talk, when one of my
numerous stage fathers said something
across the room. Of course it was the wrong
thing—so wrong that I could have watched
him drown with pleasure. I just bobbed
down behind a palm and burst out crying!
When I had finished making a fool of
myself, the nice man had been formally
adopted by a female mantrap with red hair
and a wedding-ring. Later on I captured
him again by a glorious bit of cat-strategy,
and I spent the rest of the evening, more or
less in his arms, under a huge pink oleander
tree. And I didn’t care a hang about any-
thing—just wanted to rest my tired head on
that dinner-coat, with its mixed scent of
Russia leather and. camphor. Yes, that’s
another sort of thing my Large Heart drives
me to. It works both ways, you see! I
saw his wife when we were getting away—a
sandy-haired, sharp-nosed little thing, wear-
ing a coat of the most immoral blue ever
invented. She was forcing him to put on
her goloshes, though there wasn’t a cloud in
the sky. A woman like that should be
arrested and deported.
Someone offered me a lift home in an
overcrowded car. I sat humbly on the floor
and swore I thought it fun. But I really
didn't care a bit about anything, and com-
menced to think how funny it would be if
we were all tipped out and killed. I was
glad my hair was long—it would look so
pathetic in two plaits when I was lying
quite quietly for ever. Perhaps the Pink
Oleander man would be sorry and betray
himself at my funeral. I had him planting
flowers on my grave before the motor rushed
me safely up to the door, and I found I had
forgotten the key again, like a fool.
One night lately, when no one required
me to be popular. I took myself to a lecture.
I was received at the door by a mystic-eyed
person in Indian dress, who afterwards lec-
tured before a moving-picture background of
native idiots who were improving the heated
hour by leaping round a fountain and look-
ing very much out of the lunatic asylum.
Assisted only by a glass jug of water, and a
small table with the sort of red cover on
it that makes you come out in heat rash, he
took his audience away with him into the
air and among the intangible, beautiful
visions and things that you can’t grasp
with your hands or prod with your umbrella.
His soothing, golden voice seemed to make
all my nerves go up country. He told us,
among other things, that we —or our souls —
would come back to earth again and again,
and that we would inhabit the bodies of
insects and animals. If he’s right, I would
like to be an angry cow, and then I would
like to be allowed one chance —just one
chance —at the sandy-haired wife of the
Oleander Man. Oh, I tell you I’m going to
be unpopular with some one sometime!

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.
