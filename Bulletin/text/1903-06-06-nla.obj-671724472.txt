NAVAL TRIBUTE.
TH HE abstract of the Colonial Con-
| ference held in London last year has
three impressive lines :
Naval Contributions.— Canada declined to
contribute. Australia undertook to increase her
contribution to £200,000 per annum.
The abstract, of course, is not pre-
cisely accurate. It was not Canada,
but her Prime Minister, that declined.
It was not Australia, but her Prime
Minister, that undertook. And as
Australia’s Prime Minister, before he
went to London, was expressly pledged
to commit this country to nothing at all,
he did commit this country to nothing
at all. He merely committed himself to
advocate Chamberlain’s policy in Aus-
tralia—thus justifying the apprehensions
voiced before be set out.
Presently, it appears, Barton will rise
in the Commonwealth Parlianjent to ad-
vocate the increased naval subsidy. But,
if “ loyal ” Canada can refuse to pay
naval tribute, why should Australia pay ?
jt
One way to ascertain if naval tribute
will profit us in the future, is to study if
it has profited us in the past.
The so-called “ Australasian squadron ”
came here in 1891, as a result of the
dexterous management of Australian
delegates to the Colonial Conference of
1887. The squadron consists of seven
vessels, of which four only are kept per-
manently in commission. The others are
held “in reserve”— i.e., more or less
unready for active service. Not one of the
vessels ranks as first-class.. Not one of
them ranks as second-class. Five of them
are third-class cruisers; two afe torpedo
gun-boats. Exactly what kind of fight
the whole seven, now more or less obsolete
in type, would make against one first-class
Japanese man-of-war, the British Admi-
ralty has never explained. Precisely
how long six of them could sustain their
advertised speed of 19 knots, is a conun-
drum referred to the commanders.
For these vessels Australia and Maori-
land have paid in twelve years, at
£126,000 per year, £1,512,000. Of the
annual £126,000, £91,000 is for mainten-
ance and £35,000 for interest, charged
at 5 per cent, on the £700,000 which the
squadron cost to construct.
“ The vessels have been built by the
British Government; and the Austra-
lasian Governments have no voice what-
ever in their management, nor any control
over their movements. On the termina-
tion of the agreement the vessels will
remain the property of the Imperial
Government.”— The Seven Colonies of
Australasia , 1901-2, p. 741.
je
This is a clear case of taxation without
efficient representation—a clear breach of
the constitutional principle affirmed by
Barton, Reid, and every constitutional
lawyer as essential to the maintenance of
logical and just democracy. Australia’s
right of self-government under the Crown
has been admitted by Britain—separately
for the States, once again for the Com-
monwealth. It is a right most precious,
gained originally with difficulty, and
never to be .relinquished by a self-respect-
ing people. The smallest infraction of
its authority is of the very gravest
moment.
The naval tribute agreement is no
small infraction. In every other depart-
ment of our administration Parliament
controls the expenditure of the money
which it votes. In the case of the naval
subsidy it exercises no control. The
officer in command of the Australasian
squadron is responsible, not to the Aus-
tralasian taxpayers who pay him, but to
the Imperial authorities who do not pay
him.
As constitutional States, Australia and
Maoriland work on constitutional methods.
For every penny of the people’s money
expended, the Parliaments are entitled
to demand an exact account. But, for
the money we pay as subsidy to a British
fleet, we get no account whatever. We
cannot ask how it goes, because the
admiral has nothing to do with us ; he
takes his orders from England. Would
we permit the commander of an Aus-
tralian land force to refuse obedience to
everyone but the British War Office?
On what grounds, then, should the com-
mander of an Australian sea force be
permitted to refuse obedience to every-
one but the British Admiralty 1
Under the old agreement, there was a
British pledge that the fleet should remain
in Australian waters—a safe pledge,
since, without the possibility of Austra-
lian interference, those who made it
could break it when they chose. By the
new agreement even this shred of Aus-
tralian authority is taken away. The
sphere of operations is to include Chinese
and Indian waters. Granting that an
effective blow for Australia may be struck
at Corea or Ceylon: is not the point of
attack the point of danger ? And is it not
common sense and common prudence to
preserve the means of defence at the
point of danger? Hostile fleets have
slipped past guarding fleets in the British
Channel. At the new speed of cruisers,
how easy to slip past a guarding fleet on
the other side of the Indian Ocean. And
then—Sydney ? And then—Melbourne ?
In any case, the judgment should be
an Australian judgment, not a British
judgment. The sea-dog that Britain
feeds bites where he is told. The sea-dog
that Australia feeds should bite where he
is told. If subsidy is granted on the new
terms, it will be a subsidy to the British
navy. The problem of Australian defence
will still confront us.
For £1,512,000 paid away in twelve
years, we can show no permanent benefit
whatever. The vessels remain, but they
are British vessels, not Australian. Yet
it is Australian money that has kept them
in a state of efficiency.
In the ten years currency of the new
agreement, it is estimated that we
shall pay away £2,400,000 (Australia,
£2,000,000; Maoriland, £400,000); and
at the end of the ten years we shall be
able to show no permanent benefit what-
ever. Our shores (or Indian shores, or
Chinese shores) will have been defended
—we trust; but for the payment of
£2,400,000 we shall have not one man-of-
war, not one cruiser, to call our own.
This is what Barton, supported by Reid,
backed by Seddon, tells us is the most
intelligent and the least expensive plan
of naval defence that we can adopt !
Yet the credit of the Commonwealth is
moderately good ; the credit of Maoriland
is fair. The Commonwealth could borrow
money probably at 3 per cent., or a trifle
over. An annual payment of £200,000,
capitalised at 3 per cent., is £6,666,666.
The seven vessels of the existing Defence
Squadron cost £700,000. One second-
class cruiser, better than any of
the vessels of the Defence Squadron,
costs £300,000. If we are to hire a fleet
in perpetuity, would it not be better to
put down the money at once—and own
the fleet, and control the fleet, and man
the fleet as a nursery of Australian
seamen 1
There is no need to put down six
millions. Suppose Australia were satis-
fied with the measure of naval defence
we have had in the last twelve years, and
started with a fleet to cost £700,000 —
but fewer vessels, and better. The cost
of maintaining that fleet is fixed at
£91,000 per annum. Interest at 3 per
cent, would be £21,000. A sinking-fund
payment of less than £68,000 would re-
pay the prime cost in ten years—the
term of the new agreement. So that
we should pay in all £lBO,OOO a year—
£2o,ooo less than is proposed—and at the
end of ten years we would own a small
fleet free from debt. Total of compara-
tive payments for ten years:—£l,Boo,ooo,
defence on the scale of the last twelve
years, and we own the ships; £2,000,000,
defence on a better scale, but we own
nothing.
This is urged to show the financial
absurdity of the hiring agreement. In
practice, since we have to find men as
well as ships, it would be better to start
with one or two cruisers, and add or
replace by degrees. At £200,000 a year,
we shall pay in two years for one second-
class cruiser and her maintenance, and
have nothing to show. Where is the
sense of it ?
There is no sense in naval tribute.
As a matter of fact, the subsidy is not
designed to secure the defence of Aus-
tralia. That is a secondary object. The
prime object is to secure a contribution
to the expense of the British navy, to
relieve the British taxpayer, and to
cement the bonds of empire. But at
whose cost 1 At the cost of Australia,
undoubtedly. As George Reid told
Goschen at the Hotel Cecil, London, on
July 2,1897, there is involved “a latent de-
sign on the Australian purse.” * Australia
is to bleed, in purse and life, that the
British skin and income may be saved
intact. A use has been found for “ the
colonies.” But Britain is still to rule,
though Australia is asked to pay: Aus-
tralia is to maintain the navy, but Britain
to control it—naturally.
The history of British relations with
Australia divides itself into three main
epochs. In each of those epochs British
policy has been guided by British self-
interest. In the first, Australia was seen
as a rubbish-heap at the other end of the
world, where the scum of Britain could
be conveniently thrown and forgotten.
Britain fought hard against the abolition
of transportation, and when she could
fight no longer, Australia ceased to be of
interest except as a barbarous place
where younger sons could be sent with a
chance of making money. British states-
men questioned seriously whether it was
worth while maintaining the bond of
union.
Then came Seeley’s notion that, in
view of the growth of Russia and
America, Britain must expand into an
empire, or risk falling to the rank of a
second-rate power ; and Dailey’s Soudan
contingent set the British pondering.
“ The colonies ” might pay Britain, after
all. Selfishness—neglect—and now the
wheel has turned full circle. The
African war has shaken the dust from
the sleepiest British eyes. What ! “ the
colonies can shed blood and cash to
save the Briton. What ! Australians
are fools who will follow a red herring of
sentiment so far that, though nominally
self-governed, they will cheerfully give
men and money to be spent in British
wars as Britain chooses. That is the
pleasant dream which Britain is straining
to make real.
Much water has passed under the
mill since George Reid defied Goschen in
i'V < ; and there have been many visitors
at the Hotel Cecil. Two „£ Lm w
know—Barton, Australian Premier; For-
rest, Australian Minister of Defence
They rode in British State carriages':
they smoked British State cigars • they
drank British State champagne; gold-
embroidered tapestries hung prominently
outside their British State apartments
British duchesses gave them strawberries
at garden-parties ; and—they saw Mr
Chamberlain. The British taxpayer
smiled, noting these things, confident in
Mr. Chamberlain.
Now Barton and Forrest are proposing
to pay £200,000 annually to the British
navy for ships which Australia does not
own and does not control. The British
taxpayer’s confidence in Mr. Chamberlain
has been justified—it is Australia that is
to foot the bill at the Hotel Cecil. The
persistent backstairs intrigue of the last
twelve years is about to be rewarded
through Barton and Forrest. At one
time there were doubts of Barton. It
was thought that a man who had been
called “ Australia’s noblest son” might
incline to put Australian interests before
British Interests. Plain Bill Lyne
seemed a politician more... amenable. It
is due to Barton to say that he has
banished all doubts. One could scarcely
find a better Imperialist— or a worse
Australian.
After the navy, the army—most as-
suredly. The Australian Army Corps is
already planned at the War Office.
Major-General Hutton spoke too soon
since one thing at a time is a good
maxim ; but the “ force for employment
abroad ” is nevertheless provided for in
Forrest’s draft bill. To what end is
Colonel Clarke—late Special Commis-
sioner of the War Office; author of The
N(ivy and the Nation and Imperial
Defence —governor of Victoria 1 To what
end is Major-General Chermside governor
of Queensland ? To what end is Vice-
Admiral Rawson governor of N.S. Wales 1
To what end is Vice-Admiral Bedford
governor of Westralia 1 To the end that
the governors may be recruiting-officers ;
and that “ Government House ” may be a
centre of influence for securing support
for the British army and navy. Where
the vultures are, there is the carcase.
Australia has tpAdepend upon the
lonest service Commonwealth Par-
. lament. I)g£pite the sinister alliance of
Barton with Reid, the subsidy should not
be granted. In any case, a hired fleet
should be kept for service where it is
hired. And at worst the subsidy should
specifically terminate at the end of ten
years unless fresh legislation renews it.
There is no hostility to Britain in the
creation of an independent Australian
navy, vessel by vessel, as time and money
serve. It is true that our greatest risk
of war comes from the British connec-
tion ; but were there no British connec-
tion we should still have to prepare for
war. That preparation cannot commence
too soon. We cannot'too soon have ships
of our own, and men trained to fight
them. Since there is bound to be an
Australian navy, the nucleus should be
formed at once. The talk of impossible
expenditure is nonsense. It has been
shown that the money that it is proposed
to throw away in hire can be devoted to
ownership, with a defensive result equal
to the existing power of defence. Let
us encourage our seamen.
Edmund Barton says truly that we
stand at a parting of the ways of na-
tional tendency. It is a question of vas-
salage or independence. Only the vassal
pays tribute without exercising rule.
Let us then have independence in amity
with#Britain, not distrust in subjection.
Australia cannot always be sacrificed.
Every jot of liberty that is yielded now
will have to be bought back by-and-by,
and it may be at the price of blood

DOES not every man wish to be strong, to be able to meet successfully the every-day issues of lif e
that occur ? This is impossible when the body is weak, the brain weary, and ability
to concentrate the mind is missing. It is the strong man, the man whose mind is alert,
and who is wide awake, who succeeds nowadays. Be at the top, be as good and better than
the next man. If you feel that you are run down ; that you are weak ;if you have tried the OLD
AND EVER-FAILING DRUG TREATMENT, give it up. Your body is like an engine without
steam, your nerve force is exhausted, you have no energy, you have no steam.
“Electricity is life.” It is the potent factor in the human body. Electricity is the
only rational and certain cure for functional disorders. If your BACK ACHES, if you are
NERVOUS, if you have RHEUMATISM, LUMBAGO, INDIGESTION, STOMACH or
KIDNEY TROUBLES, Electricity, properly applied, will cure you. There is no doubt about
it. It cannot fail. It quickens the pulse, invigorates the blood, puts new life into every nerve.
We have spent over Twenty years in the study and application of Electricity, and the results
have produced the marvellous invention with which we are curing thousands yearly.
Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt
It is simple, but grand. There is nothing so penetrating, nothing so invigorating, nothing that
will relieve weakness and pain as speedily, so surely. It assists Nature by a general reinforcement of
the vital energy by infusing a mild, invigorating current of Electricity into the nerves, and by
supplying the system with the very essence of Nerve Vigor and Nerve Strength.

Nostalgia.
Cold England ! with a white bias*
Shredding the country lane ;
Bowed twigs and wailing alders,
Grey sky and sleet and rain.
And oh ! my thoughts are Southward
On a shining tropic shore
That warm blue ocean kisses.
And I want the sun once more—
The trade wind s scent is in my brain
And I want the sun once more.
Cold London ! as a dead thing
Changeless and hard and stern :
A thousand lonely faces
Flit past and never turn
On me, whose hopeless longing
For a glance and smile is vain ;
And I curse the old conventions
As I dream of the South again,
I seem to olasp a dear friend’s hand
As I dream of the South again.
Cold women ! pale,’disdainful,
With wintry eyes of blue ;
Those pure proud lips, chill moulded,
No passion ever knew.
They bring to my heart, alone here,
In its haunting, beating pain,
A dark-haired girl in the sunshine,
And I want the South again.
Her sweet mouth smiles through a mist of tears,
The boom of our surf is in my ears,
The days seem mouths, and the months are years,
And I long for the South again.
JOHN POLDING.
A Prayer.
Lord, give heed to Thy servant’s plaint,
That he bow to Thy law as just;
Is it well a man should turn to the Deep
In fear lest his soul should rust ?
Is Thy power as strong on the deadened ground
As the power of the unbound Sea ?
Is Thy land but a dusty tomb, O Lord ?
For Thy truth’s sake answer me.
I feel no throb in the pulseless plain—
It lies as Thou made it—dead ;
And it is not fit—Thy pardon, Lord—
That the dead and the live should wed.
I hear low sobbing of waves that plead
To the shore that is but a bier—
Is half of Thy work unfinished, Lord?
Speak out that Thy folk may hear.
And we, who ’re made in Thy image, Lord,
The mould of Thy own good hand,
We chafe at the law—the unclean law—
To crawl on the still-born land.
The Sea’s dread mystery thralls our souls,
Fair souls that are claimed for Thee;
To whom is the ultimate triumph, Lord—
Thyself, or the endless Sea ?
U.L.
J. BARB.
Impenitent.
Give me a lovely soul to kill,
Give me a rousing dream of ill,
And the devils in hell, who work my will,
Re-echo my shout of gladness.
God gave me a soul of my own, they say,
White as the blossoms that rustle and play
In the sweet soft light of a moonbeam’s ray,
Ere dark turneth all to sadness.
But I met One there, where the slow waves fall
On the shimmering sands, with a long, low call
To the silent stars watching over all
This world, with its sin and sorrow.
And I looked deep down in the sleepy maze
Of her wondrous eyes, where the loser pays,
And the winner laughs at the soul she slays
And takes no heed for the morrow.
I have fathomed the depths of thedarkestshame,
On my blackened soul may God place the blame,
And drive it at last to the seething flame
Where I know her soul is burning.
God ! have no pity, I want none here ;
God ! have no pity, I want none there;
Only to be with her dark soul, bare,
In the pit whence there’s no returning.
N.B.W.

The Restless Spirit.
The restless Spirit bruised its wings
Against the bars,
And sought in vain the key of things
Beyond the stars;
Assailed high Heaven, plunged to Hell,
Far spaces trod,
And called upon the snows to tell
The tale of God.
The Great Hierarch on Nature’s throne
The summons heard,
And answered back the mortal groan
With mortal word.
“ A sleepless God keeps up the jest
And shapes the toys,
And envies e’en the little rest
That man enjoys.
Poor fool 1 ’Tis thou hast made the book
And writ the tale,
And when thou wilt thou mayest look
Beyond the veil! ”
The restless Spirit paused—because
He feared to see,
Then looked, and saw, and lo ! there was
No mystery !
In farthest worlds a shining sun,
And nought above,
And nothing ended nor begun,
But Life and Love.

A CASE IN PYRMONT.
A Permanent Recuperation.
The Case of Mr. W. H. ATKINS.
(by our reporter.)
What an easy matter it is for a benevo-
lent being to diffuse pleasure and gladness
around him. In order to do so it is only
necessary to consider what means are pos-
sessed to lighten the burdens of our fellow-
men, and to help in whatever direction the
conscience may dictate. It is evident that
Mr. William Henry Atkins, of No. 211
Crown-road, Pyrmont, shares in this
opinion, for he said in reply to a question
put by our reporter : ,
“ Of course, I will give you any informa-
tion you require, as the knowledge I gained
may be turned to good account by some
poor sufferer in need of good advice. It
has always been my motto to help those in
distress, and I think I can do so by letting
humanity know about the remarkable ex-
perience I had£ I think that worry was at
the back of all my troubles, for after an in-
cident which grieved me greatly, I fell into
bad health. I did not care about anything
to eat, simply because I had no appetite.
The most tasty morsels imaginable failed to
tempt me as a rule, although I had to force
myself to take some nourishment when I
felt that I could not hold out any longer.
Not only was my appetite bad, but I ab-
stained from eating because of the pains
which afterwards appeared.r My stomach
always got full of wind, which shifted about
from side to side, and left cramping pains
in all directions, and heavy pains affected
my chest. Sometimes I felt as if the
breath was being crushed out of me, the
oppression was so great, and I naturally felt
deeply concerned about it. as chest com-
plaints are so serious in their consequences.
As my food was not doing me any good I
lost strength rapidly, and soon I dropped
into that languid state of indifference to
everything which is so disastrous to every
business man’s career. I felt as if I did
not care how things went, and the morbid-
ness of my spirits quite precluded me from
thinking about anything pleasant. ' Haras-
sed as I w T as by depressing headaches, and
with my eyes dim and feeling as if they
were swollen, no wonder that I lost all in-
terest in life, for the average man does not
w ish to live unless he is contented and at
ease.” ;
“ But your lot was not so hard c 6 bear
when night came, for then, I suppose, you
obtained relief in sleep?” remarked Mr.
Atkins’ interrogator.
“Don’t you believe it; if anything, my
nights were more intolerable than the days,
as I could not succeed in getting anything
like a night’s rest. Certainly, I used to
doze off from time to time, but the sleep
was not refreshing, because of the intrusion
of repulsive dreams, and when I got up I
felt as weary as if I had been awake all
night. I could hardly stand the bitter taste
which was in my mouth every morning, and
the unhealthy condition of my stomach
could be detected by the fur on my tongue;
but what I regretted more than all else was
the quick and painful throbbing of my heart.
When I laid down I felt that organ shaking
inside in a way that caused me much alarm,
so that, with every particle of strength
being gradually eaten away by my com-
plaints, Jthere was nothing in my condition
to assist me in entertaining hopes of a re-
covery. The least exertion brought on a
feeling of faintness, and when 1 stood up I
used to get quite giddy, as if everything
was on the move. All this I put down to
my extreme weakness, which was also re-
sponsible for the annoying aches in my legs
and loins From some cause or other my
arms were also intensely painful, and if ever
a nervc>"? system was wrecked it was mine.
On the least provocation I became excited
and irritable, while the trembling of my
nerves served to increase the general misery
of my existence. My body was greatly de-
nuded of flesh, and I can tell you in all
seriousness that my life was a burden which
I would willingly have cast off at any
moment.”
“ I believe you suffered in this way
several years,” interjected the scribe.
“ During the period of your illness did you
ever enlist the services of a medical man ?
“ Considering that I was lingering, wait-
ing, and hoping for years, I should rather
think I did,” replied Mr. Atkins. “ Why,
I consulted dozens of doctors, yet my suffer-
ings grew worse, and I may also state that
I have taken scores of medicines which were
procured at stores and chemists’ shops. It
would have been far better if I had kept
the money in my pocket, for all but one of the
medicines were of no service to me. Ihe
only remedy which suited my complaints
was Clements Tonic, and this was recom-
mended to me by a man living in Harris-
street, who had used it, and knew what it
could do. After taking two bottles of
Clements Tonic I felt "much better, and was
able to get about with much more freedom.
I went, to a chemist to get some more, but
he put me off by saying he could give me
something better, and pointed out the
difference in the size of the bottles, so,
foolishly enough, I bought his medicine in-
stead of Clements Tonic, and in a few days
I was as bad as ever. Then I insisted on
having Clements Tonic, and again I im-
proved under its influence, so that there was
no doubt about its being the best medicine
in the market. I would rather have one
dose of Clements Tonic than a barrelful of
any other medicine, for it proved its supe-
riority in every possible way. The first
thing it did was to make me eat and sleep,
and I was glad of the respite from my
afflictions which I had when resting. Be-
fore long a feeling of animation spread right
through my system, and I then shook off
the yoke of depression which had clouded
my past few years, as I felt assured that
Clements Tonic would pull me through. In
course of time the pains arising from indi-
gestion were quelled; the nauseous taste
left my mouth, and my head was free from
aches. Some of my doctors said my liver
was diseased, while others said my stomach
was extremely weak; but if they had seen
me after a few weeks’ use of Clements
Tonic they would not have known me. My
stomach could then digest and retain any
kind of food, and my liver symptoms were
non-existent. The shaking of my nerves
was promptly checked by Clements Tonic,
and the regulating and strengthening effects
of that medicine on my system generally
were really extraordinary. Every ache and
pain yielded to the pacifying influences of
Clements Tonic, and I am heartily thank-
ful to say that by its exclusive use my
health was re-established. I have lived in
this.house for the past 17 years, and all the
neighbours know that Clements Tonic cured
me ; but for the benefit of those who are
unaware of these facts you may publish
them in any form you like.”

Skin -Tortured Babies
AND TIRED MOTHERS
Find Comfort in Cuticura
Instant Relief and refreshing sleep for Skin-tortured Babies and
rest for Tired Mothers in warm baths with Cuticura Soap, and
gentle anointings with Cuticura Ointment, the great skin cure and-
purest of emollients, to be followed in severe cases by mild doses of
Cuticura Resolvent Pills, to cool and cleanse the blood.. This is
the purest, sweetest, most speedy, permanent, and economical treat-
ment for torturing, disfiguring, itching, burning, bleeding, scaly,
crusted, and pimply humours, eczemas, rashes, irritations, and
itchings, with loss of hair, of infants and children, yet compounded.
MILLIONS USE CUTICURA SOAP
Assisted by Cuticura Ointment, for preserving, purifying, and beautifying
the skin, for cleansing the scalp .of crusts, scales, and dandruff, and the
stopping of falling hair, for softening, whitening, and soothing red, rough,
and sore hands, for baby rashes, itchings, and chafings, in the form of baths
for annoying irritations and inflammations, or too free or offensive perspira-
tion, in the form of washes for ulcerative weaknesses, and for many sanative,
antiseptic purposes which readily suggest themselves to women, especially
mothers, and for all the purposes of the toilet, bath, and nursery. No other
medicated soap ever' compounded is to be compared with it for preserving,
purifying, and beautifying the skin, scalp, hair, and hands. No other
foreign or domestic toilet soap, however expensive, is to be compared with
it for all the purposes of the toilet, bath, and nursery. Thus it combines
in One Soap at One Price, the best skin and complexion soap, and the
best toilet and best baby soap in the world.
CUTICURA RESOLVENT PILLS
(Chocolate Coated) are a new, tasteless,

SATURDAY, JUNE 6, 1903.
Our Naval Policy—and Our Timid
Parliament.
The opening days of the second session of
the Australian Parliament have brought more
than the average amount of disappointment
to those who look to it as a national assembly
—the chosen voice of an Australian as
opposed to a parochial or a foreign sentiment.
True, almost every Parliament is disappoint-
ing. The tradition of public life has grown
to be one of small and grubbing compromise,
of a petty barter between parties, in which
principle is blended with expediency so as to
arrive as nearly as possible at an arrange-
ment which will give offence to nobody. The
politician is thus almost invariably Mr.
Politic, when he is not Mr. Facing-both-
ways, and his real delight is to be known as
a practical politician, which translated
into plain English is equivalent to
a grocer who mixes as much sand
with his sugar as the eyesight of his
customers will allow to pass without detec-
tion. The Australian Parliament is very
much superior to any of the State Parlia-
ments ; it has some ideals ; its debates
are now and again illuminated by the
glimmering of the dawn of a truly national
feeling ; its members boast a higher average
of intelligence, and therefore are somewhat
less disfigured with the stains of petty
cunning. Still it is almost as far from the
ideal Parliament as can be imagined. It
follows the political traditions of compro-
mise and expediency almost always, and at
times is so paltry in its neglects and its acts
as to suggest the miserable little municipal
council in which Aid. Jones, who wants his
allotments kerbed and guttered, is willing to
bargain with Aid. Brown, who wants his
drained, and Aid. Smith, who has a strip of
asphalt or a road-metal contract in his
mind’s eye.
• 9 •
There is nothing more absolutely and
certainly true than that in politics high suc-
cess comes only from courage—courage,
always courage. Where the palterer and
the trimmer gain tolerance, the courageous
man wins a lasting empire over his
countrymen’s minds. That is the sure
lesson of the history of every country.
Now and again its beacon shines through
(he murk of even Australian politics (which
have been of a low grade, mainly because
there has been no great inspiring struggle in
this land, no war of independence, no
desperate resistance of an invasion) to show
a Lalor, a Higinbotham, or a Ballance
winning honor, not by chaffering in the lobby
but by strenuous purpose. In the con-
temporary records, indeed, an instance can
be found in Kingston, who is the one
member of the Federal Government
most truly respected because he is the
one member who has shown some courage,
and has not hesitated to fight dishonesty
openly. It is not complimentary to the
political intelligence that Kingston’s ex-
ample has not been more widely fol-
lowed. There are, presumably, in public
life other men strong enough to stand with
him for absolute principle, and to submit to
the wild abuse of the wrongdoer for the
purpose of winning the sturdy esteem of the
best of the community. One can only be-
lieve that they are so dull as not to see the
opportunity, for certainly Kingston lacks
imitators.

The speech put into the mouth of the
Governor at the opening of the Australian
Parliament by the Barton Government is a
conspicuous proof of the timorousness which
infects our public life as w r ith a palsy. It is,
throughout, couched in the deferential and
politic language of the man who wishes
to offend nobody and to please every-
body. What the Government would like to
do, but dare not, is postponed with a hypo-
critical sigh of regret that “ time will not
allow.” What the Government feels that it
must do, even though it encounters some
opposition, is put forward timidly and apolo-
getically, and in one case under the cover of
a falsehood. That is in the announcement
of the increased tribute proposed to be paid
to the British navy, on the condition that
such shadowy advantages as Australia gets
from its present subsidy are absolutely
withdrawn. The announcement reads :
You will be asked to ratifi' an agreement between the
Admiralty and the Government of the Commonwealth
which secures for the naval defence of Australia the pro-
tection of a powerful and continuously efficient squadron
of warships at a moderate cost.
• •
And it is simply a falsehood. The pro-
posal of the Barton Government is that
Australia shall increase its tribute to the
British navy from £lOO,OOO to £200,000 a
year ; that it shall also disband what little
naval forces it has of its own ; and that it
shall absolutely withdraw the condition of the
present naval agreement with Britain, which
binds that country in some sort of fashion
to keep for Australian protection the fleet for
which Australian money pays. It is true
that the pledge given by Britain in return
for the present subsidy, that the Australian
Squadron shall be kept to the Australian
coast for Australian defence, is one that could,
and probably would, be broken if necessity
arose. But it could only be broken by a breach
of faith. To avoid that unpleasant act
on Britain’s part, Premier Barton pro-
poses now to do away altogether with the
condition that the squadron we pay for
should be kept exclusively for our defence.
We are to pay tribute, and there the matter is
to end. The fleet which we pay for will pro-
bably be kept in our waters in peace time,
so that our idle rich may entertain its officers
and our brewers derive some benefit from its
sailors ; but in war time, it is expressly pro-
vided, the vessels are to be sent wherever
the exigencies of British defence suggest. A
candid statement of the Barton proposals—
proposals which Laurier firmly declined so
far as Canada was concerned—would be :
You will be asked to ratify an agreement between the
British Admiralty and the Government of the Common-
wealth which absolutely does away with any small local
naval defences that Australia now possesses ; which
absolves the British Government of the pledge, that it is
now under, of reserving the squadron paid for by Aus-
tralia for Australian defence ; which secures for Australia
nothing at all in the way of naval defence ; and which,
nevertheless, hugely increases the amount of the subsidy
to he paid by Australia to the British navy.
* • • •
That would be a fair statement of the case.
Premier Barton goes beyond being politic,
and is simply untruthful. He has not even
the courage of his betrayal. Were he to admit
frankly that on his recent visit to England,
dazzled by the rays of a G.C.M.G. decora-
tion ; bewildered by the flattery of London
(the more welcome because he had ceased to
receive the flattery of Australia when he
ceased to earn it) ; misled by banqueteering
speeches and specious arguments—he put
his name to an undertaking which is not so
much pro-imperial as anti-Australian ; and
that, having put his name to it, he expected
Australia to stand to him ; were he to say
these things his attitude would permit of
some sort of apology. But, timid and pal-
tering in the first instance, when he allowed
himself to be beguiled into saying “Yes ” to
an agreement which not only drains Australia
of a large tribute and removes from her
whatever protection the British fleet offered,
but also includes the abolition of any Aus-
tralian naval force which might have been
relied upon in an emergency, Premier
Barton is timid and paltering now, and
seeks to conceal his betrayal of the national
interests by the weak falsehood of the
Governor’s speech.
* * * •
And there was not a whisper of protest in
the Australian Parliament. Government
supporters sat dumb, swallowing the false-
hood as easily as the betrayal. The Oppo-
sition made no move. The Labor party
quietly acquiesced, and devoted its energy
to maundering over the dead-and-buried in-
cident of the Six Hatters who were not ex-
cluded. It might have been a Parliament
of the days of Elizabeth, so deferential was
it. The attitude of Government and Oppo-
sition men is in a measure under-
standable. Most of them cherish a
vague hope that they will be pro-
tected from desecration in their old age by
the hanging of a K.C.M.G. cross on their
breasts, or else have some other motive which
binds them to Britain, or the British
importer, rather than to Australia. But the
Labor party’s treachery to Australian ideals
is not so easy to explain. That party pro-
fesses to be the guardian of the public purse,
and should have protested against £200,000
a year of the country’s money going to no
better use than the securing of decorations
and titles for prominent Australian poli-
ticians. That party professes to be White
Australian and democratic in its ideas, and
should have fought from the first, with
tooth and nail, a scheme which, in the
case of war, might leave the
mercy of the fleet of Britain’s ally, Japan.
Probably, if the truth were known, the old
arguments of “policy ” and “ practical poli-
tics ” were used to nobble the Labor party, so
that it should refrain from dangerous protest;
and for the bait of some measure or other of
labor reform —which would have been won
far more certainly by courage than by bar-
gaining—it agreed to take up the K.C.M.G.
attitude on this question.
* m * *
The Labor party in the Australian Parlia-
ment indeed deserves the highest encomiums
from the Tories for its tame, fed-out-of-the-
hand attitude at the opening of this session.
There were three occasions for earnest pro-
test and hostile action —the presence of
Robert Reid, of the firm of Reid and Co.,
customs swindlers, in the Senate ; the false-
hood in the Address-in-Reply by which a
betrayal of Australia’s naval interests and a
looting of her treasury was made to masque-
rade as a benefit to Australia ; and the law-
less attack, during the recess, of Premier
Irvine on the Federal Constitution. On
each of these points a party with true ideas
of honest democracy and patriotic nationalism
would have divided the House. But the
Labor party, with its notions of being prac-
tical ... politic, took up an intensely lady-
like attitude of indifference. To have
referred to Robert Reid, of the Senate,
would have been “bad form;” to have
accused Premier Barton of putting a mis-
leading statement into the mouth of the
Governor-General would have vexed that
amiable gentleman ; to have impeached
Irvine as an anarchical Jack Cade would
have been going too far out of the beaten
path, and would have exposed the party to
the danger of being left in a solitary
position—the only defenders of Constitu-
tional law and of private liberty. The
Labor party avoided all these pitfalls ; it evi-
dently has its full share of the politic weak-
ness of liking to be “ with the crowd.”
• • • «.
On the present appearance of affairs, the
Australian Naval Tribute Bill will pass
through Parliament without any genuine
hostility. The Government is pledged to it;
the Opposition dare not, even for the sake
of office, go against the British importing
interests which keep it in funds ; the Labor
party may make a show of ladylike disap-
proval, but evidently contemplates no really
active hostility. Still it is a duty to point out
clearly, again and again, what are the conse-
quences of the new agreement which is
falsely described as “ securing for the naval
defence of Australia the protection of a pow-
erful and continuously efficient squadron of
warships at a moderate cost.” The cost will
be very great, more than sufficient to secure
for Australia a squadron of fast cruisers for
coast defence, which is the total of its real
requirements. The only advantage secured
will bethe presence of the warships in times of
peace ; for it is expressly stipulated that in
case of war the British Admiralty may with-
draw the ships to whatever spot it pleases.
For that advantage—purely a “ society ”
one—Australia will sacrifice money sufficient
to secure an efficient fleet of its own
and will also (which is more serious)
have to abandon its own locally controlled
naval reserves, coast-defence ships and
torpedo boats. It will strip herself of
its money and of its rights of local defence.
An equivalent policy in military matters
would be to disband all our local troops, to
pay the War Office an annual subsidy, and to
accept the quartering on our territory of a
number of regiments of British or Indian
troops—withdrawable by Britain in case of
war. Australia is asked to sacrifice its money,
its claim on British protection, and its right
of organising local forces in naval affairs.
It could not be asked to sacrifice more if
it were a subject state at the feet of a
victorious foe.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Freetrader Braddon, the Protectionist.
The following extract from the Australian Parlia-
mentary reports speaks for itself :
Mr. Edward Braddon passed on to the accusation that
he had stated in Tasmania that he was in favor of a duty
on Maoriland oats and potatoes. There was something
in that accusation. He apologised for what appeared to
be a lapse from Freetrade. Tasmania had made many
sacrifices to come into the Federation. Maoriland had
made none, and refused to join. It was not right, then,
to give Maoriland the same advantages as Tasmania.
Therefore, as a matter of high principle, he believed in
retaining the duties referred to.
As a matter of high principle —let it be especially
noted that it is as a matter of high principle—
Braddon, the bogus Freetrader, the sham Cob-
denite, the collapsed supporter of Shoddy, most
cordially believes in heavily protecting the chief
industries of his own State. Braddon, the Free-
trader, holds that because Tasmania has made
certain sacrifices in joining the Commonwealth
its special industries should be protected;
but though N.S.W., Queensland, S.A. and
Victoria have made equal sacrifices in joining
the same Commonwealth on the same terms,
Braddon, the Parochialist, can’t see that their
special industries call for any Protection what-
Bver. Braddon, the man with the parish-pumn
mmd and the local intellect, holds that because
the English-speaking State of Maoriland (whose
products compete especially with those of his own
b lyspeck) is outside the Commonwealth its K oods
should be shut out by a Protective tariff; but when
say Victoria asks that goods of England, America
and Germany, which it finds to be its most dan
gerous competitors, and which are as much outside
the Commonwealth as Maoriland is or even
further outside, should be similarly penalised
Braddon, the Politically One-eyed, is shocked
beyond measure at their ignorance of
all true political economy. Braddon, the
I heorist, says that Protection is injurious
when Victoria or S. A. asks for it, and is grieved
that these illiterate States can’t understand so
simple a proposition ; yet Braddon, the Lopsided
demands Protection for Tasmania’s iron and Tas’-
mania’s produce, and savs Protection is a re
markably good thing for Tasmania. Braddon
the Backslider, lately stumped his island denounc
mg Protection (he was himself for five years
a Freetrade Premier maintaining a Protec-
tive tariff) and bounties and bonuses as unclean
and ridiculous things, and yet, at Emu Bay
Braddon, the Fiscal Renegade, said he enthusias
tically approved of both Protection and bonuses—
for the Tasmanian iron industry, though the system
still remained loathsome and accursed for the N S
Wales boot industry. Why, in Braodon’s own
wild 1 reetrade language, should all the Common-
wealth be taxed in order to prop up Tasmania’s
tottering industries according to the tenets of an
exploded fiscal superstition, &c. ? Will Braddon
the Incoherent, explain ? ’

The Sitting-Down Policy.
Australia has not been doing at all well for a
number of years, as the natural culmination of a
helpless policy of borrowing, cadging, importing
instead of manufacturing for ourselves, borrowing
some more to pay for imports, bragging about the
“ magnificent natural resources of the country,”
and sitting-down to wait for something to turn up.
The press of Australia has been, and still is, the
worst offender in this respect, for it is the
principal expounder of the policy of helplessness
that afflicts this country. It has weird expectancy
in its eye, and melancholy apology in its voice.
The great mass of the city papers have spent
years and years telling the people to wait—till
the drought broke, till the new loan came in, till
the population increased, till the “great natural
resources of the country ” had time to assert them-
selves. Now they say pretty unanimously that
the whole trouble lies in the Immigration Restric-
tion Law, and they urge the public to sit down
and wait till that is repealed ; in fact, the cpat-
tail of the daily press is worn and green with long
sitting down to wait for something. As regards
this latest aspect of the gospel of sitting down,
the following example is cut from Launceston
Examiner, though the same sort of thing can be
found any day in almost any daily paper any-
where :
This small population is endeavoring to open up the
country by building roads and railways, erecting wharves
and bridges, and in doing so has accumulated a large
debt, which is pressing heavily on the taxpayers. Mr.
Green has stated that the two things which the island
most needs are population and capital, and the correct-
ness of the statement will be universally acknowledged.
As Bishop Mercer remarked, in opening the discussion
on the paper, miles upon miles of roads have to be main-
tained by a sparse population, and our railways entail a
loss, roundly speaking, of £lOO,OOO a year, because there
are not sufficient people travelling on" them to make them
pay. If the population were doubled to-morrow the cost
of administration of road and railway maintenance would
be but slightly increased, but we should have twice as
many taxpayers to help us to bear the burden. But any-
thing in the shape of immigration is opposed by the
party who have been dominating Australian politics of
late. Under one plea or another, the doors have been
closed against workers from other States. One of the
leaders of that party has also publicly stated that we can
do without the man with capital. Yet we find that the
State whose progress has been more rapid of late than
any other in the world is receiving immigrants at the rate
of 20,000 a month, and it was estimated that one large
party of yeomen who left England for Canada lately took
with them £500,000 in the shape of capital.
And having thus laid the blame on the other
fellow, the helpless Eat Man of Tasmania feels he
can comfortably sit down and let things slide.
But before be sits down, perhaps he will look at
the other side of the case :
(1) In nine out of the 17 years up to the end of 1901,
Tasmania sent away more people than it received— and
there was no Immigration Restriction Law till 190%. In
the ten years (1592-1901) prior to the beginning of the
Immigration Restriction Law', Tasmania lost 5251 people
by excess of departures. Also from 1860 to 1880 it lost
4655 people by excess of departures. It has been losing
almost constantly for 40 years. Therefore, it is a cowardly
lie to describe the law which shuts out niggers, diseased
persons and lunatics as the reason why there is no
great influx of population.
(2) One visible reason why' artisans don’t flock into
Tasmania, as they do into Canada, is that Tasmania
(unlike Canada with its consistently Protectionist 50 per
cent, tariff) can only say to the average artisan on his
arrival, “ We have no work for you in your own line of
business.” Canada imports to the value of about £6 per
inhabitant annually, and makes the rest of what it wants
itself. Tasmania imports to the value of nearly £l2 per
inhabitant annually, and makes the rest itself. There-
fore, Canada has, on a rough estimate, £6 worth per
annum more work and wages to offer to its people than
Tasmania has.
(3) One visible reason why agriculturists don’t go to
Tasmania is that the V.D.L. Co. is allowed to keep
a huge area of the island roadless and shut up.
Also, the available State lands are roadless and inacces-
sible, and the little private land that is available and
accessible is too dear. A large deputation of Victorian
farmers went over to Tasmania recently looking for land,
and when this influx of desirable settlers with money
turned up, Tasmania really didn’t know what to do with
it.
(4) Tasmania has spent its land revenue as it went
along, instead of using it for public works. It has
borrowed for all its public works, and for almost every-
thing else. Now it spends most of its time scraping up
the interest on its debt. It can’t borrow the money to
open up the great wilderness of the south-west. It
hasn’t courage enough to raise the money by taxation.
It hasn’t courage enough to shift the V.D.L. Co.
So, with a huge proportion of the State quite unin-
habited and inaccessible, it sends away intending settlers,
and says, with tears, that it is the fault of the Labor
party.
(5) In any case, there is not likely to be a rush of
settlers to any State which is notoriously loaded up with
debt, and where every new arrival has to shoulder £5O of
financial dead horse for himself, and £5O for his wife, and
£5O for each of his children. In no part of the world
is there a rush of settlers to a country which is deep
in debt, which imports much and manufactures little,
which has no job to offer to the skilled artisan, and
which can’t offer land to the agriculturist because it
hasn’t the money to make roads to open up the land, or
because it lets a foreign V.D.L. Co. close up a great
extent of country and order the intending settler off.
But, anyhow, why should there be this lamenta-
tion about the non-arrival of new population
when the country fails so utterly to find work
for the population it has already ? This yearning
for more unemployed in order to promote
employment is a ridiculous business. Australia
is overcrowded in the true sense of the word.
Every country which has more peoole than it can
find work for is overcrowded.


Freetrader for Freetrade Newspapers.
That very excitable, not to say hysterical, advo-
cate of Freetrade, the Sydney Daily Telegraph,
has been, during the past week or two, coming out
daily purple with indignation at the cruel conduct
of the See Government in applying to its industry
the great principles of Freetrade and unaided
private enterprise. In its frenzied protests
against the withdrawal of the State subsidy from
the industry of newspaper publishing it has for-
gotten all about Mill and Coboen and Spencer ;
it has also forgotten a good many of the facts
of the controversy. This latter lapse needs to
be corrected in the interests of the public. The
history of the whole matter is, in brief, this :
Some years ago—many years ago in fact—the
Freetrade daily newspapers of Sydney persuaded
a so-called Freetrade Government to enact
free carriage by post of newspapers—N.S.W.
papers only. This amounted at once to an
almost prohibitive postal tariff against outside
newspapers, and an enormous subsidy to local
enterprise in the newspaper publishing line. The
legality of the step was unquestionable; the decency
of it from a “Freetrade” Government for the
benefit of Freetrade newspapers, which savagely
condemned proposals for similarly helping other
and far more deserving industries, is another
matter. Then the law was stretched a little to
provide still further privileges for the Sydney
Freetrade newspapers; an early morning train
service was instituted to carry their goods to
remote centres, where they could compete against
country newspapers. To secure this for the Free-
trade newspapers the Freetrade Government paid
a special subsidy to the N.S.W. Railway Commis-
sioners. With Federation came a new era of com-
parative purity and honesty of administration. The
Australian Government, not being under the thumb
of any coterie of newspapers, imposed postage on
papers—following therein the precedent set by
practically every other Government in the world —
and refused to continue the special subsidy
(about the legality of which there is grave
question) to the N.S.W. railways for carry-
ing newspapers free. This caused a bitter
shriek from the Freetrade papers, but they
were still in this position, that they could distri-
bute the bulk of their newspapers through the
train service by themselves paying the subsidy
originally found by the Government. That was a
half- way house to an equitable arrangement which
obviously could only be temporary. Newspapers
from other States coming to N.S.W. were still
required to pay for rail carriage at a quarter the
usual parcel rate; N.S.W. papers alone were
favored by a rate approximating to one-twelfth
the usual parcel rate. It is a moot point whether
that did not amount to a differential rate con-
trary to the Australian Constitution. It was
also open to question whether the Federal
Post-office could continue to allow the N.S.W.
railways to compete with it on unfair terms
in the carriage of newspapers. The See Govern-
ment settled one part of the difficulty, at any rate,
by applying to N.S.W. papers exactly the same
railway tariff as that paid by Victorian news-
papers : it thus enacted Freetrade within N.S.W.
for Commonwealth papers. As to the absolute
justice of this there can be no question. As to
the brassy impudence of the protests of N.S.W.
I reetrade newspapers, which openly claim pro-
tection against Victorian newspapers in the
Riverina, there can be also no question. The
business of producing newspapers is, on the
whole, a highly profitable one; the dividends
earned by it are large; the natural protection
it has against outside competition puts it in a
uniquely favorable position to stand the open air
of Freetrade. So the fact that they have enjoyed
a high degree of Protection and bonuses in the
past, constitutes no earthly reason why the Free-
trade newspapers should now have Protection
against Victorian competition, and a State sub-
sidy in addition. But the fact that they demand
these aids constitutes an excellent reason why
their pleas for Freetrade for other industries, and
their frenzied denunciations of bonuses for other
enterprises should be very much discounted. It’s
a poor cook who objects to his own victuals.
The Freetrade Federal Programme.
George Reid lias made, in the House of Repre-
sentatives, a solemn exposition of the policy of the
I ederal Freetrade party, and there is little in it
to cheer up this, at present, rather depressed
community. It was partly a looking backward
and a rehash of the old weary battered stock lies
of the Importing Party; and the rest of it was a
looking forward to the good time coming when
local manufactures will be destroyed so that there
may be more imports on which to collect duty.
It was, on the whole, a muddled and dejected
utterance evolved from the tail end of a worn and
weary intelligence. George Reid complained, to
begin with, that the Government should have
made the establishment of a Federal High Court
its first official act, but as he said last session that
there was no need of haste about the establishment
of the Federal High Court, and as he bragged before
several audiences during the recess that he had
successfully blocked the Bill for the establishment
of that court, this was merely the same carping
criticism of the same old useless potterer to which
Australia is now so well accustomed. He again
assured the country that he was against Federal
direct taxation, and that, if the Freetrade party
got into power, there would be no Freetrade, for
going to eat its principles and depend
wholly on customs and excise taxes, just as if Free-
trade had never been heard of. George Reid
was elected on a policy of Federal direct taxation,
but as he is always against the principles on
which he was elected, there is little in that. He
said that he cordially approved of the clause
“ under which the six hatters were kept out ”
they weren’t kept out, but the brazen lie about
the keeping of them out has been told so often
that most people now believe it. Also he said
that he was in favor of the repeal of the clause,
and that to keep out (who was kept out ?)
honest Englishmen, Irishmen, or Scotchmen was
a disgrace. Exactly how much he knew about
the honesty of the men referred to doesn’t
appear, but nowadays the story of the F“ -'leathers
who weren’t kept out, and who were oriiyßllfeiyed
because it was eight days before their bumptious
employer would sink his awful dignity sufficiently
to supply the information required by law, is an
essential item in every Freetrade speech. And in
addition to this George Reid outlined the policy
which he intends to follow when Australia is
cursed with his presence at the head of public
affairs : Although he is allegedly a Freetrader he
is not going to practise Freetrade. Although he
says that customs duties are a ruinous method of
raising revenue, and that a 12£ per cent, duty
adds 25 per cent, to the cost of goods, he is going
to depend on customs duties. After a life-
time spent in shrieking about the blessings of
free ports he isn’t going to make the ports
free. But he is going to reduce the duties in the
hope that imports will increase so enormously that
the people will pay more customs taxation than
they do now. He is confident that if he does this
the people of Australia, in addition to having to
pay more customs taxes than they do now, will
also have to pay many millions more for imported
goods which will, to a great extent, take the place
of local manufactures and throw the Australian
citizen out of a job, and that Reid’s friend, Im-
porter M‘Millan, will then have a good time.
The joy of paying millions more for imported
goods and a good deal more in customs taxes, and
having less local employment (for we can’t import
our boots and manufacture them also), and voting
for Freetrade yet never getting it, constitute the
millenium that Australia is to enjoy when George
Reid gets into office.

Parson Hennessey.
The Rev. N. M. Hennessey, Tremayne Ddnstan’s
successor in ‘‘Mr. James’s ’’church in Pitt-street,
Sydney, having been in Australia quite three
weeks, begins to stroke the fur of the front pews
the right way ; and all the daily papers start to
cheer excitedly—on his reputation, they didn’t
think he was that sort at all. Says the Rev.
Hennessey :
There is a third group, which boasts that it holds the
balance of power, that it can affect legislation either for
the city or the State. Now, I want to put a question to
that party. How is it that, within the small area
bounded by Elizabeth, Campbell, Hay and Market streets,
and Darling Harbor, they allow' 50 public-houses to con-
tinue ? In Woollahra, there are not more than 17. If this
third party have the power they claim, why do thev not
do what the wealthier people of Woollahra—people belong-
ing to a class they sometimes denounce in intemperate
language—have already done ? And when they have
answered that question, I shall have another for them.
The Rev. Hennessey is evidently, after all, only
one of the sort who empty their slops and throw
their sardine-tins into the next person’s yard, and
then pass remarks in public about the filthy
habits of their neighbor, as shown by the quantity
of slops and sardine-tins on his premises.
Another sort of preacher than the Rev, Hen-
nessey’s sort might have looked at the matter in
this fashion :
There are people who sit in the front seats in our
tabernacles when they’re nice, respectable tabernacles,
and drop sixpences in the plate regularly. Now I want
to ask those people a question. I notice that round
their own neighborhood there aren’t any pubs.—they
won’t have them there. In all Woollahra there
are only 17. Yet in the slummy part of the
city there are 50 within a small area; and
as it’s dead-certain that the people in the slums
don’t own those pubs., I want to know who does. You
needn’t tell me—l know. You own them. You, who
are too respectable to have pubs, in your own neigh-
borhood, plant them alongside the miserable hovels of
the poor; and if the miserable and wretched poor, with
no home comforts, throng- these places, and waste their
scanty wages, and ruin even such homes as they have—
you are to blame, you smug hypocrites, you whited
sepulchres!
That’s what the Rev. Hennessey, or any other
rev., might have said, and said with truth. But
he didn’t; he said other things; and so he gets
into the papers, and perhaps the collection will
go up eighteenpence next Sunday.
Put the Shutters Up.
The Charity Organisation Society of N.S.W.
doesn’t sound promising, and its record is as bad
as its name. In the month of April last, when
3000 men and women were crowding the State
poorhouses and 3000 men obtaining out-door
relief, when children were being run in day by
day like strayed sheep, and in hundreds of
“homes” poverty sat black, cold, desolate,
ghastly—in April, the C.O.S. managed to raise
the sum of £29 and to spend £65. One-third cash
and two-thirds loan, according to the established
Geebung policy. Twenty-nine pounds sterling to
deal with whatever distress may exist in the city
and State; for nothing less than this does the
C.O.S. propose. It starts with the assumption
that “private charity is dangerous, if not bad,
and breeds imposters and makes mendicants.”
(Oh, most contemptible spawn of a genera-
tion of hypocrites, and yet lip-pledged to
tbe faith which proclaims charity without
any qualification the foundation item of life
and the main clue on immortality !) Private
charity, therefore, should be discouraged, and
yet, lest want should exist without relief, we shall
form a society, we shall have an honorary
treasurer, and a sec. and an hon. visiting
committee ; and if any fitting cases present them-
selves to us we shall deal with them. In Sydney
they deal to the extent of £29 a month, a sum
which any one of a hundred amongst the mem-
bers must have saved by giving soup tickets when
his conscience, if he had one, must have told him
half-sovereigns would have barely sufficed. It is
a king amongst humbugs, the C.O.S. Melbourne
begat it 30 years ago, and what has it done for
Melbourne, beyond provide an excuse for mean-
ness and furnish billets for mean people ? Who
can ever forget that Melbourne case of the
woman with the sick child referred to the 0.0. S.
on Xmas eve? They would inquire: Yes.
Meanwhile she must wait. She went down
to the Domain to wait, and in the morning—
Xmas morning—walked up to seek a charitable
undertaker, for in the night the child had died.
That is one sort of fruit Charity Organisation
brings forth. But there is another, and without
it in Sydney there would be no 0.0.5. Look up
the list of officials and count the busybodies, the
nobodies, and the gold-bug bodies who figure
there—who get each a little bit of cheap publicity
out of it, and because of that and the fatman’s
necessary excuse they are there. N.S.W. never
has seen—probably never will see—a worse year
than this of 1903. The exigencies strain every
State-kept (which is loan-kept) institution to the
utmost, and it ought to prick these C.O.S. folks
into such action as would justify their existence.
It pricks them to the tune of .£29 per month. It
shows them as they are, stultifiers, not organisers,
furnishers of cheap reasons, fraudulent issuers of
spurious coin as the true gold of charity. Surely
it is time the brass plate came down and the
shutters went up. The spectacle, in this time
of awful poverty and desolation, of an office
and a charity and an Organisation and a blare of
trumpets, and a sec. and an hon. treasurer and an
hon. this and an hon. that—to raise for the actual
purposes of charity £29 a month !
The Price of Small Tariff Concsesions.
Malcolm M'Eacharn told Melbourne Chamber
of Commerce, at its annual meeting, that Vic-
torian imports had lately been increasing largely,
to the great injury of Victorian manufactures.
The Argus ought to have got great joy out of the
fact, and to have shown conclusively that Victoria
was having a far better time than usual. Instead,
however, it proceeded to -be almost violent, and
to say that Malcolm was no gentleman. Why
the Freetraders should have such a horror of
Freetrade triumphs this paper doesn’t know ; it
simply notes the. interesting fact that the Free-
trader nearly always does act violently when
it is pointed out to him that imports
are booming and that our own people
have less work and wages in consequence.
In qrdinary circumstance there certainly should
have been and would have been no such
increase. Practically no loan money has
been coming: into the country, while the
average earnings of the people have, for
the past 18 months, been less than usual.
Notwithstanding these things, many extra
thousands’ worth of foreign goods have been
imported. In other words, at a time when
Victoria was thrown to an unusual extent on its
own resources through the slamming of the money-
lenders’ doors, and at the very time, too, when
the “great natural industries” failed and the
protected industries were consequently more than
ever needed to keep the people employed,
Victoria received far more than usual of foreign-
made goods, and had to find the money to pay for
them, just when it had less than usual to pay
with. As the result of a long-sustained
policy of Protection, the State had practically
shut out foreign boots and shoes ; in 1899 only
£38,483 worth were imported ; all the rest of its
boot requirements its own workmen supplied.
The Federal tariff, however, brought down the
Victorian duty. It had been almost, but not
quite, enough to keep for Victorians the work of
shoeing Victorians; a little whittled off that duty,
already barely sufficient, opened the doors of the
State for £77,154 worth of these foreign goods in
1902. In the furniture trade the position was a good
deal worse, simply because the reduction of duty
was worse. A 30 per cent, duty in 1899 secured
for Victorians the supply of all but £32,568 of
their requirements; 10 per cent, was knocked off
the protection, and in 1902, notwithstanding that
the bootmaker and the farmer had less money to
spend on furniture, £85,487 worth came in from
abroad and had to be paid for. The clothing
trade suffered even worse again than the furniture
trade. With duties ranging from 35 to 40 per
cent, against him, the foreign worker could only
find a Victorian market in 1889 for goods
valued at £186,015; in 1902, when the protection
had been reduced to from 15 to 25 per cent., the
foreigner wrested from Victoria’s own workmen
£254,762 more trade than he had had in the earlier
year. Precisely the same thing happened in
connection with the manufacture of machinery,
brushware, earthenware, matches, and hats—the
protection was reduced, and the foreign imports
increased. More money had to be paid to the
foreigner when there was less to pay him with.
And yet the amount by which the duty was
reduced seemed in most cases small; it was just
the sort of small concession which even the Daily
Syme, when he sent his Freetrade friends, Simon
Frazer and Zeal, to the Australian Parliament,
seemed to think it necessary to make to Free-
trade. If Victoria is Protectionist it must vote
Protection. In the Vic. State Parliament one or
two alleged Freetrade members did not seriously
count. In the Australian Parliament, however,
they do count; there they can join forces with the
Calico Jimmies from other States, and the com-
bination, even if it isn’t strong enough to rule, is
at least strong enough to win concessions—the
concession, say, of a 15 per cent, duty instead of
one of 20 per cent. Victoria ought to know now
what concessions of that kiud cost; and, knowing
the price, it should once and for always resolve to
give up sending any more Frazers and Zeals to
the Australian Legislature.

Treasonable language from Sydney Telegraph’s
London correspondent re the state of Freetrade
England, and how it is being overtaken by its
Protectionist rivals:
England has reached an acute stage in its existence....
The people in the British Isles must think of themselves
first and last and all the time. They must realise that
their commercial supremacy is being challenged by
nations like Germany and the United States, which,
although they have not succeeded in compelling the
English flag to strike, have reduced it to half-mast.
London was, and in a sense still is, the financial centre of
the world, but less so than it was two or three years ago.
England has no war on its hands, it has no foreign com-
plications, it is on the friendliest possible terms with
every nationality in Europe, its rapprochement with the
United States has almost reached the stage of affection •
and yet English consols, the most thickly of
all England's securities, have fallen from 114 to 90. . .
This would not mean much if there was any prospect o
an immediate revival. As a matter of fact, the financial
centre is being shifted to some extent from London to
Paris and New York. London was the financial Green-
wich Observatory of the world. The financial lines Of
latitude and longitude were taken from London* its bank
rate and its market rate governed the Continent and the
United States. It is so still nominally, but not altogether
actually. London is nearly as much governed by Paris
and New York as it governs them. It may regain its
former undoubted ascendancy. Probably it will, probably
also only for a time.

The Unemployed.
Sydney Daily Telegraph, last week, in a sen-
sational four-column article, suddenly discovered
the “unemployed”—discussed the evil at great?
length, made a quotation from Herbert Spencer,
and came at last to the conclusion that the un-
employed exist because our present breed of men
are not like the early colonists, who would “ work
long hours for low wages and poor food.” That,
as far as can be judged, is the D.T. remedy for
the unemployed—longer hours, lower wages,
poorer food for the workers ; and it must be ad-
mitted that, from a Tree trade point of view,
it is the only reasonable remedy that can
be suggested. Our natural “Freetrade” in-
dustries, wool-growing and mining, are not
sufficiently great to maintain the present popula-
tion. It is unreasonable to hope for any great
further development in either ; indeed, the records
of the past few years have been of shrinkages. If,
then, there are to be no unemployed, the other
workers of the community must engage in other
industries. But, in doing so, they come into
competition at once with cheaper workers in
Europe and Asia—the men who work longer
hours for lower wages and poorer food ; if Free-
trade is observed, they have no bulwark against
that competition, and they must come down to
the wage, hour and food conditions of the Russian,
the Hindoo, and the Japanese. And, in practical
working, it would be found that many could not
come down to these conditions and live, as does
an Asiatic coolie, on a diet of rice, houseless,
and almost without raiment. So the unem-
ployed difficulty would not be wholly
(though it would be partly) solved even with
the Freetrade ideal of low wages, poor food and
long hours. There is another way out of the un-
employed difficulty—the way which the D.T. is
wilfully blind to, but which is yet being slowly
taken, and that is the way by which the United
States and Canada have reached to a great pro-
sperity—the way of Protection. Australia imports
from abroad annually £42,000,000 worth of goods,
the major portion of which could be manufactured
here by our own workers—articles of iron and
pottery, textile fabrics, food supplies, meats,
leather in its various forms, wood-work and glass-
ware, printed matter and liquors. If by scientific
Protection every manufactured article which
could be produced locally ynder reasonable
conditions was practically debarred from
entering the Commonwealth, employment of
a . remunerative kind, in iron works, woollen
mills, potteries, food factories, would be found
at once for every man who wants work in
the country, and for many more besides. Then
with a proper administration of the Immigration
Restriction Act, the influx of outside unemployed
of an undesirable class could be prevented, and
the want-of-work problem solved for good, except
in regard to the shiftless, the lazy and the abso-
lutely incompetent—the small residuum of every
social organisation. The remedy for the unem-
ployed evil by the Freetrade plan is long hours
and low wages ; the National Protectionist ideal
is more industries ; and to that ideal we have so far
progressed haltingly, mainly because the Labor
party shows a curious reluctance to come to a
definite choice between the two methods.
Just now, when Australia is ruined by borrowing,
by the repression of manufactures and other
drought-proof industries in order to foster
the attempt to grow wheat in a desert, by the
land sale policy and the chronic refusal of the
wealthy classes to pay taxes, and when the
one great overshadowing problem is to prevent
lack of employment degenerating into wholesale
starvation, almost every Tory is unanimous that
the whole trouble arises because more people
don’t come here. E. B. Forrest, of Queensland,
who was a very mild person when he ran against
Kingston, raged greatly on this subject at the
A.M.P. meeting, where he told the old
distorted yarn of the Six Blathers over again,
and complained that the Federal Government
was “blocking people of British blood.”
If he had said that to Kingston, the
big Minister of Customs would have
asked him to name the British - blooded
person who was blocked, and then Forrest would
doubtless have crawled under the table in his
inability to remember any single instance. The
cheerful impertinence with which the Australian
Tory assumes that people want to come to the
most drought-stricken and debt-laden white man’s
country on this earth—the country which is full
of his decayed banks—and are only prevented by
the fact that certain hatters were delayed for a
few days in landing, is something enormous.
During the 20 years 1881-1901 Queensland only
pained 6429 people (say 321 people per year) by
immigration apart from those whose passages
were paid by the State out of loan funds. When
E. B. Forrest and his friends have made their
country a place so carefully shunned as all that,
the less they say the better.
+. .
Dr. Mackellar, M.L.C., went out of his way, at
Bank of N.S.W. meeting, to make a reference’ to
the Victorian railway strike :
The attempt by a comparatively small section of the
employees of the State to coerce the authorities by a
strike with a view of disorganising the whole railway
traffic of Victoria was well calculated to destroy the con-
fidence of the world in our Parliamentary control, and I
think that the calm and resourceful determination of the
Government can scarcely fail to produce a healthy tone
in the community; for had the attempt to over-ride
Parliamentary authority succeeded, the ultimate effects
would have been fraught with disaster to the best
interests of the whole people.
And he had never a word to say in condemnation
of the “calm, resourceful” Premier who asked the
Vic. Parliament to pass an Act which would have
allowed any body (the Rats Push, for instance)
to break into the Melbourne branch of the Bank
of N.S.W., if it was suspeoted that any cheques'
for the railway strikers were passing through its
hands. Bank Presidents should eschew politics •
when they make ignorant remarks on political
subjects customers are apt to think that they are
equally ignorant on banking matters.
The cause of the loss of the Oaklands, which went
down off Port Stephens (N.S.W.) with such
sacrifice of human life, will probably never be ex-
plained, the chief item of evidence being now at
the bottom of the sea. But there are a good many
vessels on the Australian coast whose prospective
loss is quite explainable, and every time a vessel
goes down, and that futile and slovenly thing
called public opinion turns a little in its sleep as a
consequence, it is well to mention the matter
Anybody who cultivates the acquaintance of the
men who repair ships, and listens to their tales
“Wiser Counsels Will Prevail.”
Lord Onslow, Under Parliamentary Secretary of State,
gaid in a speech at Glasgow that an idea of creating an
Australian navy was noticeable in certain quarters of the
Commonwealth, He hoped, however, that wiser counsels
would prevail. Lord Balfour, of Burleigh, Secretary for
Scotland, stated that the colonies recognised that the
disposition of their naval forces must be directed from
London. — Cablegram.
It were better had you gone slow
With your gospel, noble Onslow,
With your picture of the footman running at the
Empire’s wheel;
It were better had you stated
That this land is animated
With a strong dislike for helotry and manacles of
steel!
When you said, dear Lord, at Glasgow,
That you’d like to see our “ brass ” go
Into British naval coffers, you told but a futile
tale;
But fear not, dear Lord Onslow,
We will keep the cash we’ve won slow—
We will burst it not on Britain; wiser counsels
will prevail!
And 0, noble boss of Burleigh,
Rise and learn this lesson early:
We will run our own sweet navy when we get it
off the stocks,
Lest you man its bridge with princes,
Who —as histpry evinces—
Chiefly shine at piling cruisers high and dry upon
the rocks.
We can do that for ourself, Lord,
Therefore we will keep our pelf, Lord—
When we start our Austral navy we will steer it
through the gale.
Hope not, Burleigh, that we’ll loan it—
We shall keep and run and own it—
We will not sublet to Britain ; wiser counsels will
prevail !
When we get our navy going,
And its furnace-bars are glowing,
We will find the men to steer it —we shall breed
the hearts to drive !
When our own flag bloweth o’er us
We shall hew ourselves a chorus—
We shall write a hymn of battle that shall keep
ourselves alive!
When we’ve hoisted coal and kit in
We will not send home to Britain
For a crew of Hinglish sailors and a British
captain pale;
We will grow the crew and captain,
We will not be Empire trapped in—
We’ll be steersmen, owners, fighters—wiser coun-
sels will prevail!

Patriotism Exalteth a Nation.
♦ ♦
This may not be quite orthodox, but it is nevertheless true. It is also a fact that in N.S.W.
patriotism is sadly lacking in its people. Parochialism and selfishness are rampant eveiy-
where-in Parliament and People. Instead of AUSTRALIAN MANUFACTURED GOODS
of equal merit to the Foreign-made Article being preferred, they are only taken if CHEAPER.
The very men who cry the loudest, “ AUSTRALIA FOR THIS AUSTRALIANS ! ’’—even to
the extent of keeping out the English Hatters—are those who, from pure prejudice, call
for the Foreign-made Article in preference to the Australian production. This is not the
spirit that prevails in America, and which has made it the greatest country on the face of
the earth. There nothing is good unless it is “ ’Murkan,” and so it must be here if we are
to become a Nation. The Rosewarne Packing Co., Limited, have lately added to the other
branches of their canning business the manufacture of Potted Ham and other Meats, m
two and four-ounce tins. The packages are neatly got up, the contents are AT LEASI
EQUAL TO, AND THE PRICE IS LOWER THAN, THE IMPORTED ARTICLE. Be
patriotic enough to give them a trial, and you will find that they are REALLY GOOD.
They may be had from all the Principal Storekeepers and Grocers.
over the long, confidential beer, will understand
this. Their stories are mostly about vessels
which come in for repair with their plates so worn
that anybody can drive his foot through the hull
in many places, and which are patched up with
cement, because cement is cheaper than new
plates, and which cheerfully go to sea
again, presumably having been inspected by
the blind eye of authority, and passed without
question. In extreme old age it seems as if
a vessel’s bottom was liable in Australia to be one-
quarter iron plate and three-quarters cement,
and if the great dead weight and accumulation of
cement cracks badly when the vessel is being
wrenched about in a tumbled sea, then the
bottom might almost as well be made of glass or
ship biscuit or any other breakable. Just a coffin
of rotten plates held together by earthenware
repairs is the fair description of a kind of vessel
which appears to be quite possible on the Aus-
tralian coast. What kind of vessel the Oaklands
was this paper doesn’t know (it hears nothing
against her reputation), but every time it hears
of a wreck it thinks of the craft the dockman
describes over his beer —the one that potters
about small, obscure, out-of-the-way ports, and
“ takes a lunar ” at Providence.

Coming hard upon the abbreviated skirts
of “The Circus Girl,” at Sydney Royal, “San
Toy” shines with a serene, Star-of-Venus-
like refulgence by sheer force of compari-
son. Its dialogue, which, under other cir-
cumstances, might seem thin, looks brilliant,
and the music appears glittersome and as
catchy as a lawyer-vine. It takes more than
gorgeous scenery and a wealth of dresses to make
a successful musical oomedy, and there is in “San
Toy ” some of the genuine flavor, which makes it
all the more regrettable that the pretty, Oriental
extravaganza is this Saturday to give way to the
“ Runaway Girl,” with its unwise school-girl and
its weird assortment of Dagoes. ‘ * San Toy ” suf-
fers from some of the complaints that are common
to this class of work. Encores are allowed to run
the piece on till long after 11 p.m. Encores should
be sternly suppressed. Few musical comedies
manage to make their funny man a coherent part
of the show, and why Li was created, except to
get into ridiculous positions, is a mystery. He
gives one the idea of being dragged into the show
by the pig-tail, though it is here admitted that
Fred Graham drags him in as artistically as
possible. The Mandarin Yen How and President
of the Board of Ceremonies Sing Hi (otherwise
Bantock and Sweeney) are perfect models of dig-
nity, This writer met many mandarins in the
opium-scented town of Lawrence (M.L.), but none
of them were so dignified as Yen How and Sing
Hi. The Confucian repose of the two literati
is a beautiful example to the Emperor of China
(who is Arthur Lissant when off duty) but
that potentate doesn’t live up to the imperial
calm of his rank. Miss Musgrove, as San Toy,
justifies a lot of things, but the Emperor requires
a lot of justification. To Miss Lillian Digges, as
maid Dudley, belongs the distinction of being
the prettiest girl on the stage. This remark
doesn’t disparage the other girls either.

The most recent upheaval of the a layers’
Club was in Pinero’s “Lady Bountiful,” at Syd-
ney Lyceum last Saturday afternoon. That strange
play, grim as a Norse saga and melodramatic
as a penny dreadful, is enough to test the genius
of the finest actors; but the Players managed to
make some of its force hit the audience and drag
heavily on the heart-strings. The sublime selfish-
ness of Roderic Heron was well represented by
Horace de Lissa, and writer heard three ladies
of mature judgment declare sotto voce that
they wouldn’t marry de Lissa: he acted the
part too well to make a good husband. As
the young man of heroic honor, Philip Lytton
was as good as when he acted the part of a poor
parson in the Theatre Royal months ago; and
that was about his high-water mark. Miss Brent
and Camilla Brent were moderately well done by
Misses Holroyd and Ahearn ; but the successful
lady of the afternoon was Miss Oriel Hotson as
Margaret Veale. A humorous side item of the
show was the enthusiastic way the audience ap-
plauded Margaret Veale when she declared that
the common people could never be anything else
than common, despite education, musical accom-
plishments, and all the rest. That applause was
significant of many things.

This paper, which has known Frank
Thornton for a good many years as a comedian
whose business it has been to make people forget
their creditors, now begins to suspect that he has
partly repented. In the fact that, at the end of
a season of fun, at Sydney Criterion, he put on
“ Facing the Music,” it scents a subtle suggestion
to Owe’stralia that that’s just what it will have to
do—it may forget the creditor for a while, but
he’ll have to be faced, after all. So this paper
recommends Thornton’s concluding piece at the
Cri. as a Great Moral Lesson. It also recommends
it as an utterly ridiculous farce-play with a
genuine laugh every two minutes. Besides the
subtle suggestion beforementioned, it has a more
obvious moral, which is that if you’re going to
live in populous residential chambers when you’re
married, it’s a mistake to be born with a common
name like Smith or Brown. “Facing the Music”
is preceded by a one-act piece, “ The Clown,”
which is as bad as the other is good, or more so.
Nevertheless Carden Wilson drags into it some
clever imitations of well-known mummers. After
Friday of this week Thornton will remove hi 3
goloshes and his other jokes to Adelaide, and
thence to the West.

Fitzgeralds’ Circus will pack up its bag of
lions, and put its performing whale away in its
box, and tie the box up with its serpent, and
leave for other scenes at the beginning of next week.
Meanwhile it is making a supreme effort to surpass
itself in these last few days, and the dog which
turns 20 somersaults in 20 seconds is growing giddy
in his determination to give the audience a good
twelve-penn’orth of inverted dog for its shilling.
Fitzgeralds’ on this last visit has come so near to
being the best circus Sydney has ever seen that it
deserves to carry good luck with it wherever it
goes. It struck Sydney at a time when the city
badly wanted cheering up, and the sight of its dog
upside down in the air has done something to
lighten the load. It reminded Sydney of George
Reid’s political somersaults, and though he
struggles over himself in a fat laborious way and
the dog doesn’t, the resemblance was sufficiently
close to recall old times.

The gruesome Face which looks out of the

its mouth an arrangement of sounds which freeze
the marrow of the onlookers, will utter its nine
piercing yells on Friday night for the last time.

remembers aright, is a base aspersion on liquor,

“ Oh What a *Tight ” concludes at Sydney
Palace Theatre this week, and the Giddens co.
takes its fine talent for humor elsewhere. On
Saturday Miss Maggie Moore opens at the Palace

come, it is hoped that she will strike the public
fancy also.

If Sydney Dental Hospital Concert Commit-
tee could see its way to repeat the programme it
lavished on a half-filled hall last Saturday night
this writer thinks it would make something worth
giving to the charity. The night was wet, and the
fact that the programme would be of such excel-
lence had not sunk into the wooden head of the
public. A pupil of Mr. Burnes Walker,
Miss Zara Leston, sang Allitsen’s _ “ Song of
Thanksgiving ” —her first appearance in public—
and created an admiring stir. Miss C. Brandon-
Usher used her magic fingers on the Steinway to
Lisztian magic music. Mr. Weir’s “My Queen”
was warmly encored. Mr. Bertram Flohm, a
new and very harmonious-voiced reciter with an
uncommon repertoire, assisted. Mr. Rivers All-
Sress, Miss Maud Dalrymple, a kiddy named
lay Atkins, and Messrs. Bentley, T. Rainford,
Elijah Thompson, Truman, Atkins, and Mrs.
Woodforde also used their undoubted talents in
the cause of a worthy charity. And the show
they gave was worthy of the charity ; the trouble
is that the audience wasn’t worthy of the show.

“ Bikerena, a new American idea, proved
to be a good and exciting “turn” at Sydney
Tivoli last week. Champion cyclists Gudgeon
and Megson, pedalling furiously on real bicycles,
gave impetus to clock-work machinery which
recorded the strength of their respective efforts.
The machine gives all the effect and excitement of
a real race, responding to every spurt of the riders,
and the “ barracking ” is as lively as at a cycle
meeting. There ought, however, to be some
netting protection to the stage, if the force of
its rider’s efforts carried one of the cycles off the
machine, there would be one or two sudden deaths
in the orchestra or stalls. An attractive addition
to the Tivoli programme is Miss Bella Perman in
an agile dancing turn.

“ Secret Service,” which brought Frawley
and co. to notice, at Her Majesty’s (Melb.), last
Saturday, has the name of its American author,
Gillette, stamped upon every act. More melo-
dramatic and domestic than a play by Sardou, it
is constructed after the method of that French
master-craftsman. There are no cheap sensation
scenes, where the painter and mechanist supply
the success. The strength of the finest situations
lies in their silent effects, whilst the weakness
of the drama is in its comedy episodes and its
occasional redundancy of talk. As a dialogue-
writer, Gillette is far inferior to Sardou, but he
equals the other dramatist in his art of working
up the interest to points of legitimate intensity.
Three plays by Gillette have been staged in Mel-
bourne. The first was “ Held by the Enemy,” a
story of the American Civil War, produced some
16 years ago, at the Bijou, by Nelson Decker;
afterwards revived, at the Opera House,
by William Rignold ; and later, in a
rough but creditable style, by a luckless
management at the old Alexandra. The next
Gillette work to strike Australia was that in-
genious shocker, “ Sherlock Holmes.” Both plays
arc recalled to mind by “ Secret Service ” (which
came between them in America and England),
seeing that its hero is a military Sherlock Holmes
who gets held by the enemy. That is to say, he
loves a female member of the enemy, and acts
accordingly. The author of those three plays
seems to dwell affectionately on the idea of a
calm, brave, resourceful man being unable to
attempt to escape from a girl.
* * * *
It is the time of Civil War in America.
The end thereof is very near. An officer in the U. S.
secret service has bluffed himself into the Con-
federate city of Richmond with a view to making
things easy for the besiegers. His object is to send
a bogus message from the War Dept, telegraph
office, and he gets control of the office through
the daughter of a Confederate general, in whose
house his false, deceitful tongue and restful de-
meanor have made him welcome. But the
chivalrous Sherlock Holmes-like nature of the hero
will not permit him to take professional advantage
of his opportunity. The girl has stood by him
after she knew him to be a spy. He abandons
his designs on Richmond City in consideration of
her kindness, which doubtful virtue proves its
own reward in the 4th act. Not being a human
miracle, same as Sherlock, this audacious schemer
gets cornered at last, and when he is about to be
shot, a benevolent Brigadier-General comes along
and announces that the bogus telegram was not
dispatched. So the nice girl squeezes her hero’s
hand, and her relatives suddenly approve of
him for a reason which is too long to mention, and
the unfortunate villain of the piece is scoffed off
the premises. The villain’s sin is not very
apparent. He also loved the girl, and because she
didn’t reciprocate, he pitted his own secret service
talents against his rival’s, and outwitted him, and
wished to shoot him when he got a genuine patri-
otic excuse for doing so. The drama teaches that
successful patriotism as regards War affairs may
be contemptible villainy, whereas another fellow’s
dereliction from duty may be a noble thing, pro-
vided there’s a lady in the case. Women make a
lot of difference in this world.

If Gillette’s clever drama fails to prosper
at Her Majesty’s, the Melbourne public must
take the blame for their general indisposition to
give their minds to tragic stories, and their
pretty general lack of interest in America’s great
Civil War. There is nothing to draw the multi-
tude except the play as a play. The two scene-
sets are merely passable ; the average quality of
the performance seems just) good enough.
Daniel Frawley treats the leading part as
Cuyler Hastings would treat it, and both of them,
presumably, have formed their quiet method after
the “original” author-actor. Frawley has a
fleshy, Napoleonic face, and a George Rignold
head of hair. Not a magnetic actor, he gets
through this part with ease, and manages to hold
the house in his silent periods, even when a period
lasts more than five minutes. Miss Van Buren,
who plays the heroine, is a buxom charmer, with
an hour-glass figure ; too frilly and affected at
the outset, more convincing when her troubles
come, Plimmer is satisfactory as the “villain.
He has to droop his head and bear a lot of abuse all
the time, and in the 3rd act he is unjustly sat
upon by a fool of an officer; nevertheless he
succeeds in appearing as though his misfortunes
serve him right. Other serious parts fall to Miss
Susie Vaughan, Stanford, and Wallace Shaw, who
wears a black complexion and talks an incompre-
hensible niggah dialect. An old niggah woman,
played by Miss Hill, is an irrelevant comic char-
acter. Also there is much frivolity by Miss Eva
Dennison, as a 16-year-old damsel from across the
street —the counterpart of a character in “Held
by the Enemy.” Miss Dennison plays the part
winsomely in an exaggerated style, whilst Hugh
Ward tries his best to realise the character of a
boy enslaved by the too-coquettish
hoyden. Ward at the age of 19£ is a severe strain
on the imagination of his old admirers.

In an ordinary way, one performance of
farcical comedy sandwiched between two massive
pieces of Shakspeare would probably be a financial
failureandanunpardonableoffence. “OnChange,”
staged at Melb. Princess’s for Saturday night
only, was something out of the ordinary way, and
it scored a particular success. Robt. Court-
neidge, having been brilliantly starred (or
rather cometed) in the advt., was expected
to shine. He shone. He careered across
the firmament for one night only, and was
called upon for a speech at the finish. In days of
yore Courtneidge seemed to get inside the
character of the old Scotch professor without
stretching it to its fullest dimensions, but on
Saturday he made it a great character part. And
there were other reasons why, in the language of
the sometimes truthful daily pressmen, “the fall
of the curtain was the signal for an ovation.”
With the exception of Courtneidge and Mrs.
G. B. Lewis, all the principal performers
were members of the imported Shakspeare co.
This lapse into light up-to-date comedy brought
out the evidence of their versatility. Miss Nora
Kerin, Lathbury, Norman Partridge, Miss
Cynthia Brooke, Croker King, and other people
who helped to play “The Dream” on Friday,
showed talent of quite another sort on Satur-
day. Also Miss Margaret Cellier, who didn’t
get a part in “The Dream,” made a graceful
first appearance in this bright and fleeting show.
When Courtneidge’s speech had been rounded off
by three volleys of “ hooray ” the stage was
cleared for further rehearsal of “As You Like It.”
* * * *
Spectacularly considered the “ As You
Like It ” production at Melbourne Princess’s is a
larger triumph of artistic endeavor than even the
“Dream.” Perhaps Shakspeare’s ill-built poem
hardly deserved such beautiful scenery and so
much pains. The question is not worth discussion ;
so long as there is a demand for gorgeous panto-
mimesand expensive melodramas a manager may be
excused for giving Shakspeare a handsome show.
This production is a feast of stage pictures. The
painting, lighting, and groundwork effects are
fine. The well-dressed figures take their proper
places. Every detail has been thought out. Two
of the finest pictures are the scene of the wrestling
match, in the first act, and the last scene of all,
where Rosalind speaks her epilogue in the fore-
ground of a breezy landscape, which is a master-
piece. Between these, there are five forest scenes,
bolder in design than any previous Forest of Arden
staged in Australia. The acting in this case, as
in the poetic parts of the “Dream,” is specially
likeable. It seems true to the spirit of the play.
The characters, with the sad exception of a
young Messenger who descends upon the final act
like a ton of modern bricks, speak their lines
poetically. Norman Partridge, if sometimes too
assertive in Orlando’s elocution, is always manly
and spirited. Miss Nora Kerin is the prettiest and
youngest we have seen in the part of Rosalind.
She plays it on the sprightly side. The surface
effects of her performance are charming and
would be still more so if she moderated her smile
and walked without bending her knees. Miss
Dora Rignold supplies a grave and sympathetic
Celia, who makes a well-defined contrast to Rosa-
lind. The accent of Miss Maud Milton’s Audrey
is more rustic than her appearance. Touchstone,
who clowns in the flesh of W. H. Denny, is
efficient but not brilliant. B. H. Everard scores
heavily as Jaques in an orthodox style. The
banished Duke (A Croker King) makes a favorable
impression. Small parts of Corin and Phebe are
brightly and youthfully played, and the scenes
between old Adam and Orlando are excellent.

Mark Hambourg’s genius had so impressed
Melbourne that the second Saturday night con-
cert drew a great multitude to the Town Hall.
Some of the people massed themselves at the
back of the platform, and what with the vast
attendance and the immense enthusiasm the
Town Hall didn’t know itself for the same place
where Gerardy froze a year ago. A pianist who
can crowd that building in defiance of the winter
is a magician, with a divine right to look as extra-
ordinary as he pleases. Owing to this full recog-
nition of Mark Hambourg’s merits there are to be
two more Melbourne concerts ere he sails for
Maoriland. On Friday afternoon he will invite
another warm greeting, and on Saturday night
the final rush for seats will eventuate.

At the Royal these are the last nights of
“ The Price of Peace,” unless something happens
to give a new topical interest to Bland Holt’s Par
liamentary drama. What it needs just now is
the kind assistance of a Premier in Australia or
abroad, who would drop dead whilst struggling to
hurl invectives at his honorable friend on the
front Opposition bench. The robbery of a cipher
telegram from Joe Chamberlain to Irvine would
also be a timely advt. for Holt’s show, and the
incident of a society bride-elect refusing to devour
her prey after bringing him to the altar would
keep the “Price of Peace ” on the bill for another
three months. If none of those things occur
Premier Walter Baker will cast off his benevolent
white whiskers, and the discursive drama of
British political life will be succeeded next week
by “The Breaking of the Drought.”

John F. Sheridan, the widow of the late
O’Brien, returns to Melbourne next Saturday
(6th) after a considerable absence. He has hung
out his respected banner at the Bijou, and the

public is “The Lady Slavey,” which musical
comedy has not yet appealed to Melbourne’s
tenderest feelings.

breathing world. Mrs. Palmer, Mdme. Keller-
mann, Hattenback, Rebottaro, and among others
Madame Leon Caron will implore Providence to
bless the Prince of Wales. Also a chorus, and ze
Great Napoleon himself will join in this beautiful
demonstration of French, German, and Italian
loyalty to the personage aforesaid.

At Adelaide Royal the tuneful nonsense
of “The Chinese Honeymoon,” which runs on
aimlessly till the clock strikes eleven, and then
shuts up without coming to any definite end,
seemed to hit the local taste exactly. May
Beatty had six or eight recalls every evening in
“I want to be a Lydy,” and the four statuesque
bridesmaids consistently disregarded Lauri’s gag
that they ought to go and put some Clothes on.
The Chinese princess with the American accent
was also popular. “The Thirty Thieves” is
bringing the Musgrove season to an end. The
Tivoli is to re-open shortly with Willoughby and
Co. in farcical comedy.
Among some bits of parchment, centuries
old, held by a Christchurch (M.L.) resident, is a

of the peace.
“ In China, the Russians and the French

N.S.W. Works Minister Owe’Sullivan
was wanted as a witness in the Melbourne libel-
case, Ogier v. Norton. Owing to pressure of poli-
tical business he wrote to the Judge re a post-
ponement, and the language of the Judge
about the impropriety of this easy and
economical proceeding was withering in its
severity. Owe’Sullivan should have instructed
his solicitor in Sydney, to instruct his agent
in Melbourne, to hire a barrister, with a long
skirt and a lot of hair that didn’t belong to
him on his head, to explain the matter to the
Judge—and then it would probably have been ex-
plained much less lucidly than by letter.
From a Spectator report on the Navuloa
Mission Station, Fiji:—
The subjects taught are all those that will be useful to
students as teachers afterwards. First and foremost has
been put down the life of Christ, of which as complete a
study as is possible in the first year is made. Then comes
theology, which always secures their deepest interest,
though the Fijian has no doubts. And who would disturb
him in his happy faith ? Biblical criticism, of the Old
and New Testaments, finds of necessity a place on the
curriculum, while sermon criticism and homiletics have
a place also. Questions of genealogy are the most
frequent of all questions that are put to the missionary,
for to a Fijian pedigree is important. What was the
name of Lot’s wife or Peter’s mother-in-law are typical
questions, and to one who has no distinct taste or ability
for climbing genealogical trees such questions are often
puzzling and unwelcome. The climax was reached when
the writer was one day asked the depth of the well into
which Joseph was cast.
Why do people not go to church ! Pro-
bably one reason is the Rev. Archdeacon Bartlett,
of Goulburn, who recently denounced the Vic-
torian railway men from the pulpit as being at
the beck and call of a few demagogues who had
but their own ends to serve.” Presumably, the
holy gentleman never looked into the merits of
the case, and just cheered with the rich mans
party, regardless whether, in doing so, he was
helping to circulate a disgraceful slander or not.
The leaders of the Victorian strikers sacrificed
their positions and their pensions on a point o
conscience. Would Archdeacon Bartlett or his
kind do that much? As to why people do no
go to church, it is, at least in part, because there
are honest and upright men in the commum y
who don’t want to be found dead in the same
paddock with that servile, time-serving, t ut ;
hunting institution.

The balance-sheet of the Great Southern Con-
sols G.M. Co. (Vic.) for the last half-year shows that the
underground electric haulage plant, which was supplied
and erected about seven months ago by the Austral Otis
Engineering Coy., South Melbourne, sole representatives
of Ganz and Co. Ltd., Budapest, Hungary, has effected a
saving of 60 per cent, in manual labor required to operate
the mine. This excellent result, and the great satisfac-
tion the plant has given, has influenced the directors of
the Berry Consols Extended Company in placing an order
for a similar plant with the same firm. The plant will
consist of a generating station, three underground loco-
motives, and a complete electric lighting installation.
This order furnishes further evidence of the high esteem
in which Ganz’s apparatus is held in Australia.*

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
What is referred to as “a serious difficulty”
faced the Federal Govt., the other day ; and the Federal
Govt, dodged it promptly. Under the Public Service Act
Federal officers must assure their lives with an “approved”
society ; and the alleged difficulty was to discriminate
between the rotten societies and the sound ones. The
Govt., however, would not discriminate ; it decided to
“ approve ” everything that might come along—from the
best of them down to the Eternal Improvident office that
was started last week or so by some other office's office-
boy. Probably the fact that the Eternal Improvident is
“approved by the Governor-General” won’t get for it a
single civil service policy ; in fact, it won’t get ap-
proved for that purpose at all What it will want
the approval for is to be able to flaunt the fact in
its advts., and use the approval as incontest-
able proof of its soundness when it calls on Mrs.
Rafferty to canvass for a four-penoe-a-week policy.
When the Eternal Improvident fades out of sight Mrs.
Rafferty will probably denounce the Governor-General as
having been in the swindle with the ex-office boy ; and
won’t be so very far wrong. This paper, in fact, has
hopes of seeing the lady waving a heavy fist on the steps
of Govt. House and demanding her money back. When
that happens the Govt, will stop the farce of “ approv-
ing” insurance societies promiscuously. Or if it isn’t
game to approve of some and pass no opinion whatever
about the others, and if Parliament doesn’t think that so
much gameness is called for in a Government, then it
might very well alter the law—it might command the
officers to assure their lives, and stop short at that.
* * * *
Manager Teece, of the A.M.P., writes that it
isn’t possible to get from the society’s report information
as to the average extent of the policies issued last year
in each State. What, however, was shown in this
column last week, was the nett addition made to each
register during the year. Thus the number of policies in
N.S.W., on Dec. 31, 1901, was 45,164 ; on Dec. 31, 1902,
47,796—an increase of 2632. The sum assured on Dec. 31,
1901, was £14,420,956; on Dec. 31, 1902, £14,868,585, or
£447,629 more ; so that each added policy in this State
represented an average addition of £l7O to the gross
amount assured. It isn’t always easy to explain matters
in two or three words at the head of a column ; yet, in
view of the preceding columns, it seemed that the head-
ing “ average amount of new policies ” would be under-
standable. Of course, the total number of policies issued
was much greater—as a matter of fact, while
the nett addition was as shown, 7508, the
gross was 15,591, 8083 policies becoming void. The
distribution of these 15,591 policies it is impossible to
ascertain ; all that can be said about them is that the
average sum assured under them was £237. In the list
of the society’s assets given last week £371,865 was
credited to “ office furniture ” instead of office premises.

The writing-off, it will be seen, was more liberal last year
than in any of the previous periods shown. It’s pretty
depressing, though, to find that, year by year, an
Australian society’s securities become less valuable, instead
of becoming more valuable as securities in a healthy
country should.
The expense rate of the Colonial Mutual, which
had been high hitherto and still is high, nevertheless
shows a considerable improvement, and that at a time,
too, when the movement has generally been the other
way

A weak feature of the Colonial Mutual is its
interest-earning power. The year’s results are a trifle
better than those of two or three years past, but nothing
better than that can be said of them :

The correct course, however, would be to calculate th
interest earnings, not upon the assurance fund alone, but
upon the whole funds—investment fluctuation fund
included. The securities are supposed to be worth
the full amount for which they are included as
assets ; in other words, the society is supposed to
have securities of the full value set out and the
amount to the credit of the fluctuation fund into the bar-
gain. And reckoning on that basis the interest return
was last year at the rate of £3 19s. 4d., against £3 17s. lid.
for 1901, £3 17s. lid. for 1900, £3 19s. 4d. for 1899, and
£4 Is. Bd. for 1898. Why the earnings are so low isn’t
apparent, either, from the accounts as published. The
holding of public securities (which might be expected to
return alow rate of interest) isn’t by any means heavy,
although it is satisfactory, from one point of view, to see
that the amount is steadily increasing ; in 1896 Govt, and
other debentures represented 6J per cent, of the assets,
whereas on Dec. 31 last they represented nearly 12J per
cent. Probably the explanation, or a good part of it, of
the low return lies in the item “freehold and leasehold
property,” which now represents just under 35 per cent.
of the assets. This item is still increasing, but not now
rapidly. In view, however, of the very large amount
(£677,376) even now represented, and in view of the
large capacity of this class of security for fluctuating, it
is by no means certain that the amount now to the credit
of the investment fluctuation account (£85,967) is sufficient
for all purposes.

At Bendigo (Vic.) last week, in an insolvent
estate, a grocer’s retail wine and spirit license was sold
by auction. There are only four such in Bendigo, and
they cannot be increased, though they may be trans-
ferred. The license, after brisk competition, was knocked
down for £6lO. The annual fee is £35. The license
m question is possibly a remnant of Michie’s Single
Bottle Act.

N.S.W. Full Court has sensibly decided that
the protection given to life insurance policies, to a
certain amount, against the bankruptcy laws, does not
apply to a sum borrowed by a bankrupt on the security
of his policy. The protection is given with the idea of
encouraging the citizen to leave some provision for his
wife and children in case of his death ; any act (such as
borrowing on the “surrender value”) which endangers
the continuance of the policy is against the obvious
intention of the law.

The expensive Melbourne libel case of Staines
v. Coombs and Co. (the commercial inquiry agents)
resulted in a strangely illogical judgment by Justice
Hood. Plaintiff Staines, manager of a Melbourne tea-
room, represented the dual grievance of himself and the
lady proprietor of the business. Last year they heard of
damaging rumors in circulation re the financial standing
of the tea-rooms, and they were evidently justified in
believing that the ill report emanated, or got a good deal
of its repetition, from the local private-inquiry firms.
In order to settle this question Staines employed another
man to go in the disguise of an ordinary bona-fide
subscriber and procure a report from Coombs and Co. as
to the “credit” of the tea-rooms. The report stated
that Staines was addicted to betting at pony meetings,
and his alleged reckless expenses were recklessly
defrayed by the lady who employed him. Judge
Hood found that this was an untrue report, but
inasmuch as Coombs and Co. had issued it in good
faith to a person who was conspiring with
plaintiff to get the untruth for libel action pur-
poses, the plaintiff was not entitled to damages. His
Honor dismissed the case without costs to either side.
The air of Melbourne is thick with inaccurate rumors of
the sort this particular tea-shop suffered from, and it
seems, from Judge Hood’s showing, that the law will
give no satisfaction to a victim who traces an injurious
rumor to an authoritative source. A commercial inquiry
agency is a privileged libeller because it is authoritative,
and lives by supplying statements concerning other
people’s business. The libelled trader has no chance of
getting the libel delivered, save by false pretences,
nevertheless the false pretences invalidate the libelled
person’s claim for damages, or even costs, against the
libeller, provided that defendant has, in good faith,
repeated only the hearsay of the man in the street.

Victoria’s railway muddle grows worse every
day that Bent rages at the helm of affairs. Though half
the passenger trains have been abolished, leaving so

the goods traffic has practically reached a deadlock. At

Apparently the variation in the income-tax accounts for
the fact that 20 per cent, means more one year than it
does the next. Since 1897 the profits have fallen from
the stupendous £213,547 of 1898 to a loss of £46,936 last
year—while just as steadily the disbursements to share-
holders have increased from £14,501 to over £35,000.
Even now, with an absolute loss on record, the ex-
travagant dividend of 20 per cent, is maintained. The
explanation offered for this is that the losses were really
the result of unremunerative business accepted prior to
1902. At the best this means that there wasn’t
any real profit for 1901, and that the dividend
in that year was not earned ; and the only amends
the co. could make for that was to either “pass”
a dividend for 1902, when the miscalculation was
discovered, or at any rate reduce it; and it did neither.
In 1898 the co. plunged into a business as to which there
was no experience to serve as a guide. This business was
created by the British Employers’ Liability Act of 1898.
With practically no experience to go upon, most of the
old conservative companies stood off it ; the Ocean, a
comparatively' new concern, and struggling for a front
place, took the new business freely. It says now that it
really didn’t want it, but that it was forced into
taking it by the belief that otherwise the co.’s
chief agents would have transferred the whole
of their business to co.s that would take it. The premium
rates have now, however, been revised, with the result
that, after the struggle, the insurance in respect of over
20 millions sterling of wages has passsd to other co.s.
The gross income will, therefore, probably show a decline
in the future, but as this should Lie the result of the
weeding out of the most unremunerative business, pro-
fits may be expected to revive again. Notwithstanding
the year’s loss, the reserves, considering the co.’s age
and subscribed capital, are unusually large. Of these
reserves £361,788 is represented by British, colonial, and
foreign public securities, and most of the balance by
American and foreign railway bonds.
Broken Hill Prop, put up a record for the
last four weeks : it mined and milled 51,000 tons of ore.
This probably isn’t far from a world’s record for present
production, either. The Alaska Treadwell, the great
’Murkan producer, mills about 30,000 tons a month ; no
Rand mine quite reaches 25,000 tons.
* * * *
he Junction is about the unluckiest of all the
Broken Hill mines. Its ore body is irregular and is diffi-
cult and costly to work, and when, during the recent
lead boom, the co. might have made a haul, it missed it
because, just before, there had been a great fall under-
ground, where a run of good ore had been greedily torn
out and not replaced by timber or refuse. Its record
during that period of rising and high prices was as
follows:

Silver is now 2s. OJd. and lead about £ll 12s. ; so that,
even assuming the way has been prepared for numerous
economies underground and in the mill, the figures don’t
hold out much hope of any profit at anything like present
metal prices. The directors will hardly resume produc-
tive work until lead gets to £l3, and looks like staying
there. The co. has liquid assets valued at £6168, and
current liabilities £ls3B—a surplus of £4630. Last half-
year’s expenses, exclusive of depreciation, amounted to
£4740. Fortunately for shareholders there is no reason
why expenses should continue at this rate.

Cobar Gold Mines (N.S.W.) return for March
was £7154, or £2lOO less than that of February. The
falling off was due to a stoppage of the mill caused by an
accident to some of the machinery. The long-threatened
dividend ought soon to be declared.
* * * *
Mount Boppy (near Cobar, N.S.W.) in March
produced 21320 z. from 2438 tons. It is over twelve months
since a dividend was declared, and as the mine has been a
regular producer all the time something more than Is.
per share ought now to be available for distribution,
unless the money is being applied to the purchase of
additional plant.

Cobar Chesney (Cobar, N.S.W.) is to be
reconstructed. If £50,000 can be raised, it is well
and good. Mine prospects warrant the raising of this
sum to wipe off existing debts and provide for proper
equipment.

The first step towards the completion of the
Great Oobar deal has been taken. The first deposit has
been paid, and it is stated that it will not be long before
the full amount is put up. The purchase price Of the
Great Oobar and allied properties is £1,150,000.
If underwriters part with this amount, the
chances are that the public will be asked to partici-
pate in a “ good thing ” at £2,500,000. A working capital
of £250,000 is talked of. Rumor has it that the trouble
with some dissatisfied shareholders has been overcome,
and that nothing now stands in the way of the comple-
tion of the deal barring the first essential—Bull's cash,
with which he is chary of parting. Sid Joseph is entitled
to all credit for working the deal to the present stage.
Only those who have been behind the scenes can have
any idea of the many difficulties which he had to en-
counter. There were complications within complications,
and every move seemed to suggest more law. Luck has
been with Joseph to some extent. He had the advantage
of a low copper market on which to buy the mine at this
end, and now has the pull of a good copper market to
assist him in selling it at the other end, in addition to
which there have been most important developments at
the mine.

Outside the Westralian goldfields, the develop-
ment of the N.S.W. coke industry has been the most
striking thing in connection with Australian mining
during the.past ten years. The output in 1892 was 7899
tons. Since then :
1893 .. .. 17,858 tons aB9B .. .. 82,222 tons
1894 .. .. 34,458 1899 .. .. 96,530 „
1895 .. .. 27,630 „ 1900 .. ... 126,213 „
1896 .. .. 26,351 „ 1901 128,882 „
1897 .. .. 64,202 „ 1902 .. .. 126,872 „
Ten years ago N.S.W. coal was pronounced unfit for use
in smelting, and probably, as then produced, it was ;
little care had been taken to wash the dirt out, and the
product was heavy in ash. The present Under-Sec. for
Mines (then Govt. Geologist Pittman) did good work in
repeatedly drawing attention to the possibilities of the
industry. Even then, though, N.S.W., so used to
making for itself nothing which it could import, did
little in the matter; the big strides have been
mainly the result of Vic. enterprise, working through the
B.H. Prop., Mt. Lyell, and Sulphide cos. The slight
falling-off in quantity last year doesn’t mean that the
local article is losing ground ; on the contrary, a smaller
proportion than ever of foreign coke was used, and the
stuff will soon be out of the Australian market altogether.
The explanation is that the lower prices of metals have
blown out one or two of the smaller smelting plants,
while—more important still—the developments of the
past 12 months in smelting pyritic copper ores at Mt.
Lyell and in desulphurising Broken Hill silver-lead ores
have been extraordinary. A large part of Mt. Lyell ore
is now made to practically smelt itself ; only about a
tenth of the fuel formerly used is required. The sulphur
in the ore is made to serve as fuel. In connection with
silver-lead the process is different, but the principle is
the same; the ore, concentrate, or slimes are roasted
either in a desulphurising furnace or in an open kiln
before they are put into the smelter. Once set alight
the mineral “cooks” itself, so altering its character that
one smelting furnace now does the work that was
formerly done by two

In his annual report, the N.S.W. Under-Sec.
for Mines makes a slashing attack upon the prospecting
vote, and declares that it does the mining industry no
good. Yet, on top of that, and issued with it, is the
report of the mining inspector in the Oobar district; —
“ The Crowl Creek mine has continued to develop in a
most satisfactory manner. . . . The mine already pro-
vides employment for over 150 men. . . . The discovery
of this mine may also be ascribed to the prospecting vote,
as the first prospectors of this part, Shuttle and party,
received Govt, aid, and the discoverers of the Crowl
Creek were attracted by the small patches Shuttle and
party were finding. Where formerly there was no work,
150 men and their families are now supported.”
* * * *
Considering the all-round laxity of supervision
and the general disregard of regulations exposed by the
report of the Mt. Kembla commission, the surprising
thing is that the butcher’s bill in the N.S.W. coal industry
isn’t larger than it is. Last year it cost one human life
to win every 56,000 tons of coal ; but that was a gloomier
result than usual, in consequence of Mt. Kembla. For
2b years the average has been one victim for about every
165,000 tons. Even this, though, is a good deal less
satisfactory than the English experience ; a 20-years’
average there is about one corpse for every 191,000 tons.
Modern French and Belgian figures are ratherbetter, again,
than these. But, no matter what the supervision may
be, in the experience of most, and probably all, countries,
far more miners die from accident than any other class of
workmen. In England and Wales a small fraction over
every fifth person who is killed is a miner. After the
njiner, but a long way after, come fishermen, cab-drivers,
and painters. Yet, in spite of that, the fisherman’s is
nearly the most healthy of all occupations, being beaten
only by the parson’s, the farmer’s and (on English and
French experience) the grocer’s. Heaven only knows
why it favors the grocer like this, except it be that it is
the grocer’s sand that kills and that the grocer doesn’t
put in the sand for his own consumption.

The old Sydney Harbor Collieries, Md.
(London), is in process of disappearance ; and it is an-
nounced that a new co. with the same name and a
capital of £400,000 in £1 shares has been floated in
Sydney to take over the whole concern. What really has
happened is that a co. has been registered in Sydney,
G. R. Dibbs, Jas. Inglis, and five others having the
necessary one share each to secure registration, the old
co. taking the other 399,993 shares. The English co. had
issued 16,000 ordinary and 18,734 preference shares, £lO
each ; these shareholders will be entitled to take
up the new shares, with a liability of ss. each. The
issue, to the extent of 320,000 shares is guaranteed
by the New Century Trust for a trifle of about
£BOOO. The old co. had about £45,000 of deben-
tures out; the new co. has power to issue up to £130,000,
including the old £45,000. These debentures have a
currency of ten years from this date. The Birthday
shaft has been bricked to the bottom of the sump
2937 ft. —and a pair of parallel drives have been put into
the upper coal seam. The seam consists of an upper and
a lower band, divided by shale. The upper band, from
which, in the course of the driving, nearly 2500 tons of
first class mineral was won, improved from about 2ft. 4in.
to over 2ft. Bin. as the shaft was left, and there was also a
slight improvement in the lower band, which is, however,
under Ift. thick. The object of the reconstruction is to
sink the second shaft, with a view to reach the seam
where it is thicker,
* * * *
As to the profitableness of hauling from great
depths (the problem of most interest in connection with
the Sydney harbor colliery), the 1902 report of the big
’Murkan copper co., the Tamarack, comes opportunely.
It works five shafts —3408 ft., 4356 ft., 4892 ft., 4450 ft.,
4938 ft.—and last year made fair profit on ore that aver-
aged 20‘91b. refined copper per ton of rock hoisted, or,
as we should reckon it, on just less than 1 per cent. ore.

Some of the virtuous utterances of the Mel-
bourne mining conference are calculated to make a cat
smile. At last week’s meeting, a letter from the Gipps-
land Mining Board was read. It condemned “ the system
of floating mining companies in England and elsewhere”
but it omitted to throw light on the location of “ else-
where,” which is presumably far beyond the Mount
Deddick radius. Then ex-Minister Burton complained that
“many ventures are put upon the market by mere
paper men, who care nothing for the real interests of
mining.” Where, O where, are the promoters who study
any real interests of mining outside of their own ven-
tures? All mines have the same title in the sight of
Heaven —“ The Number One Reward.”

King Lansell, of Bendigo, is pulling round again,
so he may yet witness a cherished desire -the discovery
of payable gold at a depth of 4000 ft. It may not be long
before that is an accomplished fact, as the New Chum
Railway shaft is fast approaching that depth, and “ en-
couraging indications ” are being met with. Lansell has
never figured as a philanthropist in the ordinary sense,
but in his pluck and enterprise he has been a public
benefactor of high degree. But for his dogged determi-
nation in testing the deep ground, Bendigo would have
been almost a deserted field by now.

Madame Berry West (Vic.), in its half-year to
May 6, paid £4050 in divs. (4s. 6d. per share). The total
profit was £4662, equal to about 5 2-3dwt. of every loz. of
gold won. The co. has £913 in hand.
Details of Mount Lyell and North Lyell amal-
gamation scheme show that the Melbourne co. has much
the better hand in the deal. The days of Mt. Lyell as a
profit-earner, run on its own, were numbered. Ore has
been consistently decreasing in value, and the quantity
available is certainly measurable Coincident with
decrease in value there has been a decrease in work-
ing costs, thanks to Sticht’s magnificent management,
but they have been practically reduced to a minimum.
North Lyell leases undoubtedly contain the bonanza of
the field. It will now become the copper mine, ai d
Mount Lyell the flux mine. When the combined pro-
perties are in full work there will be an enormous output
of copper, and a drop of £lO per ton in value will not
materially affect profits, as it would do with'Monnt Lyell
solus. North Lyell people were probably eager to accept
any proposal which would extricate them from the quag-
mire of debts and difficulties into which they were
plunged through the mistakes of management and the
interference of theoretical “ experts.” The most gratify-
ing feature of the scheme is the decision to retain Sticht’s
services. He stands to-day without compeer in the Aus-
tralian mining world as an all-round administrator.

Those “spontaneous offers of assistance
from loyal Victorian citizens” during the railway
strike boiled down, when it was all over, to fierce
demands for compensation— for, in many cases,
merely offering to do work the claimants were un-
fitted to perform. Many of the persons who said
they had come to Melbourne to offer their aid
were squared by bonuses of £lO and all expenses,
but some claims are still unsettled. One extra
loyal individual claims £lOO and expenses for
offering to act as fireman and finding his services
unnecessary ; Bent is understood to be lustily, but
so far unsuccessfully, bellowing at this grasping

The other day the Maorilander, who
already had the choice of 213 religions, looked
into the Christchurch police court and caught a
fleeting glimpse of the 214th. It only seemed
like an ordinary maintenance case till the lady
explained to the fatherly beak why she couldn’t
eat the same victuals and shelter under the same
mosquito-curtains as her husband. It was all,
she explained, a matter of affinity ; and her
religion, “Our Father’s Church,” went nap on
affinity every time. She didn’t mind cooking his
chops and sausages for him, she said ; but as her
husband wasn’t her affinity, the relationship
must stop dead at the frying-pan. The husband
didn’t embrace the idea with any enthusiasm ;
whereupon the wife explained that the proper
thing for him to do was to go out and see if he
couldn’t find an affinity of his own. But the plan
of having an affinity and a wife in the house didn’t
appeal to him either. He was a man of small
means, and both of the ladies would want three
meals a day, and there wasn’t any telling when
the affinity might change her mind and join the
wife, whereupon he would have to go out and look
for another affinity ; and it occurred to him that
with an affinity and an ex-affinity and a wife in a
small house there would probably be trouble. Up
to that point the fatherly bench seemed to have
a good deal of sympathy for the husband; but
when the latter proceeded to fire the wife out
(whether to make room for an affinity or not
didn’t transpire), the bench made the usual order
for £1 a week. So “Our Father’s Church”
scores, and its disciple is relieved of the task of
cooking the chops.

A hapless deserted wife, at Port Melbourne,
recently, solved, in the simplest of all fashions,
the great problem of “How to live.” Like a
similarly-situated wife at Richmond (Vic.), she
had lately been refused State help for her large
family of small, deserted children, and, hopeless
and despairing of making a living for herself and
three little ones where, just now, it is hard enough
for a vigorous man to do it, she wrote the local
constable to see to her babies, and took her own
life. Then the State promptly took charge of the
orphans. The woman practically levelled a charge
of constructive murder at the soulless, miserly
Irvine Government, which lately desired magis-
trates to quit mothering so many children on the
State. She practically sacrificed herself to save
her children; but that sort of heroism is wasted
on the Icicle Government. It has as much sense
of shame and as much feeling as the cabbage
Bent grew in his better days.

The past summer has been notable in
Melb. seaside suburbs for the vigorous manner in
which cleanliness has been suppressed by the law.
The early dirty Christians never attacked the
vice more bitterly. Small children of three
have been solemnly arrested and charged
with indecency for floundering in the
waves, and the grown man who dared
to bare his legs to paddle did so only
at the risk of losing his liberty.
The howl of the ancient virgins
who take objection to people
washing themselves is mostly
bogus, even from their own
standpoint, for the regu-
lar bathing places
around the coast are
so secluded that even
the casual visitor
stands very little chance
of being shocked by dis-
plays of manly form unless
she hunts for them. A Brighton con-
stable describes how he was once
approached by two gaunt elderly women who
claimed that he should tramp to Black Rock—three
miles distant—and arrest some men who were
bathing on the beach. “ But they’ll be dressed
by the time I get there,” he pleaded ; “ how will
Ibe able to tell them ? ” The foremost com-
plainant grew earnest. “ I saw their noses above
the water; I think they’re Jews,” she explained.
The dirty Gentile’s anxiety to run in the clean
Jew!

A few days back the new-chum parson of
the fashionable Pitt-street (Sydney) Congrega-
tional pulpit wanted to know what the Labor
party, with all its boasted influence, had done to
improve the social condition of the people; and,
parson-like, he reckoned up the social condition
of the people by the number of its pubs. By
what the parson himself would certainly say was a
special dispensation of Providence, the Attorney-
General’s Department had in hand at that moment
a return dealing with this very subject; and this
return, published three days after the new-chum
had made his foolish remarks and asked his more
foolish question, show that, during the past 20
years, the number of pubs, in the Sydney metro-
politan district have been reduced from one for
every 293 persons to one for every 607 persons. It
seems now to be about up to the Rev. Pitt-street
to refer to himself as a meddlesome blunderer
who, in his blindness, was guilty of attacking the
very party which has been doing the thing that
he says wants doing most.

The 40 odd M.L. legislators, who have been
drifting about for a month in the South Seas,
reached Raratonga on April 24, and some news
about them has come to hand. About three days
out from Auckland they set up a concert com-
mittee with power to murder any music it laid its
hands on, a recreation committee, a cards com-
mittee, and probably a bob-in committee. Every
morning there was a large Sandow class, “ fol-
lowed by cold tub and ‘hosing down.’” “Some
of the members brought works appertaining to
the South Seas and files of Parliamentary papers
dealing with Island questions, and studied them
closely.” This heavy mental exercise enabled the
litterateurs to make a concise summary of their
surroundings when the Mapourika nosed her way
among the coral reefs, and they remarked : “ The
natural resources of these islands are capable of
immense development.” The excursion boat
seems to have had a mixed cargo of champagne
and Maoriland flags. If Mr. C. H. Mills
(Minister of Customs) sighted a native he set sail
after him, ran him down, and “presented him
with a Maoriland flag.” On April 27, during a
heavy gale, “there were several narrow escapes
from falling cocoanuts.” Most of the legislators
were hog-fat when last heard from.

Melb. has an Infectious Diseases Hospital,
but it isn’t working because there is no money to
furnish or maintain it. In the meantime the
Children’s Hospital won’t take infectious cases, so
that all the accommodation for young (and poor)

Even with two or three kiddies to each bed (hideous
overcrowding), this only mops up about 300 cases

An article in Sydney E. News of May 23
on the strongly self-reliant qualities of the Aus-
tralian people is melancholy reading. The doctrine
that we are utterly helpless without foreign loans;
that we can t possibly be expected to pay enough
taxes to keep our accounts square, but must have
deficits and more loans as a matter of course; that
we can’t possibly, by reason of our natural help-
lessness, expect to manufacture our own goods
but must import; that we can’t expect to have
our own navy, being too helpless ; that every
Fat Man must lean on the Government while the
Government leans on Cohen—all this is taught the
Australian people by their papers to a degree un-
known in almost any other civilised country. And
yet there is hardly another country in the world
where the daily paper article and the political
speech about the wonderful self-reliance of the
people recurs so regularly.
The K.O. clan in N.S. W. is much troubled
over the question of the preference given to Hugh
Pollock, “called” in 1890, in his capacity of
Solicitor-General. The K.C.’s appear to be
making a mountain out of a mole-hill. When the
Solicitor-General was a politician —as were
Darvall, Lutwyche, E. Wise, Dailey, Hargrave,
Faucett, Isaacs, Josephson, Salomons, Windeyer,
Innes and Reid—the precedence was admitted and
all these men led in court. Pollock is purely an
official, but it is difficult to see how the fact of his
not being in politics affects his legal billet.
About a recent horror :
Melbourne’s newest sensation was in two sudden acts
On a Tuesday morning Mrs. Stott and her two babies of
3 and Xi years were found dead in their bed, killed with a
tomahawk. Mr. Stott, who had retired with his family
as usual the night before in the single room they rented
was missing. On Thursday evening—6o hours after the
murder—the driver of a Oollingwood train comine
through the Spring-street tunnel, heard a shot and felt a
slight bump. He reported the matter and started on the
return journey. At the first stopping-place (Jolimont)the
guard, noticing a continuous bumping underneath his van
investigated, and discovered the remains of the much-
wanted husband, Stott, entangled in the brake gear
The post-mortem showed the cause of death to be a
half-ounce of lead in the brain from the revolver subse-
quently picked up in the tunnel, the rest being simply an
extra precaution to make sure of death. Stott is said to
have been a reasonably kind and fond husband and
father, but he had had exceptionally hard luck. Coming
to Melbourne from Wood's Point, he got a week’s work— at
14s. a week and his tucker—and probably the hopeless-
ness of his outlook got on his nerves. Also his surround-
ings were calculated to drive any man mad. The family
lived in one room of a four-roomed house in a terrace—
really, a two-roomed house, with two small cupboards at
the back. The front view was a narrow street in
Prahran with similar dens opposite; the rear view
a yard as big as a table-napkin. In this four-
roomed mansion dwelt nine persons. Melbourne
promptly started, in its own quaint way, to assist
the police to find Stott, even if it made a stupendous ass
of itself in the process. Reports poured in wholesale as
soon as it was known Stott had “escaped.” One youth
saw him walking near the Yarra in deep thought, waving
his arms in an aimless manner. Two women over Toorak
way said they saw similar irregular proceedings about
the same time ; they even got a field glass to view the
details of the expected suicide, but before they could
focus it the man disappeared, and then a couple of arms
were extended from the river and a dark objcet was sesn
floating away. They identified this apparition as Stott. A
railway fireman, who knew Stott years ago, travelled to
St. Hilda with him fully six hours after he was alleged to
have floated himself down the Yarra. A Park
employee came along with minute details of an
unkempt individual who had left a bag of scones in his
care on the Tuesday and had promised to return for
them “ God knows when,” and whom he had accidental y
met next day. He then returned the scones, and was
informed the suspect had got a job at a certain factory.
Feeling sure he had got Stott, he followed his man for
several miles, sending cyclists, tram men and others for
the police, but when a constable finally arrived, lo! the
suspect had disappeared. This trail was strenuously
followed up till a thoughtful ’tec dropped in at the
factory the man had said he was working at, and
behold ! the man was there, and he wasn’t Stott at all;
moreover, he wasn’t at all like Stott. There were a lot
more identifications, including one of a suspect at Ballarat
who was actually run in and locked up for the night.
Altogether Melbourne got quite interested in Stott.

Finding that supine State Parliaments
won’t take measures to prevent Australia’s Bung
adulterating Australia’s beer, the Australian
Government has moved in the matter. A pro-
clamation has been issued forbidding the importa-
tion of hop aromas, hop oil, hop extracts, hop
flavors and hop bouquets, whether in their own un-
disguised character, or compounded with other
materials used in brewing processes, or as ad-
ditions to beer. That’s pretty thorough, and if
strictly enforced will do a lot to prevent
Australia’s stomach being corroded before its
time. Australia would be greatly benefited if
similar prohibitions were extended to half-a-
hundred other trades.
THE CAUSE OF DEATH.
MEDICAL EXAMINER : “ And at what age did
your grandfather die? ”
APPLICANT FOR ASSURANCE : “ One hundred
and five."
M.E.: “ And what was the cause of his death?"
A.F.A.: "Well, I suppose he thought it was a
fair blanky thing, anyhow .”
A very gradual lady asked Judge

She was married away back in ’63, and her
husband, a market gardener, went to market one.
day in ’Bl and failed to return. She said he was
such an objectionable husband that she was rather.
glad of his disappearance, and omitted to make
any strenuous efforts for his recovery. She didn’t
want to marry again, but had decided to ask for
a divorce to make sure he wouldn’t turn up and
disturb her old age. She got her decree. The
next petitioner on the list said her 12 years of
married life had been highly unsatisfactory, and
in ’9B her husband also unaccountably disappeared.
He owned the amazing name of Patrick Parsons
Percy Persse, which, perhaps, accounted for his
eccentricities.
IN THE NIGHT-WATCHES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Here in the soft luxurious warmth,
With wifely arms in the dark about me,
I, the faithless of soul, am pressed
To the trusting; heart that could never doubt me.
But, ah ! that other —
The love forbidden,
That Life concealed
And Death has hidden.
Against my forehead her low sighs stir,
Around my shoulders her curls entwine.
Like birds night-blinded her white hands creep
To nest content in the clasp of mine.
But, ah ! that other—
The fingers cold,
The warm fingers
Under the mould.
In murmurs drowsy with love and sleep
Is tenderly whispered a name—my own—
By a mouth of Springtime, a mouth as fair
As a crimson blossom from God fresh blown.
But, ah ! that other —
The ashen lips,
Where wet o’ the grave
For ever drips.
E., M.L.
TRUE CONSISTENCY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I often lie on the sunlit strand,
Stretch’d out at ease upon the sand,
Away from the city’s bustling mart,
From toil and toilers far apart,
With head supported on my hand.
And thus, while listening to the band—
Which comes, I think, from German-land—
With lazy limbs and happy heart,
I often lie.
I am, by trade, of legal brand,
And thus my very work is planned
The same soft pleasure to impart ;
For, practising my lawyer’s art—
As you, of course, will understand—
I often lie !

“Grant Hervey ” : Melbourne girls must
be very languid if there be only two of them
(“F.C.,” B. 2/5/’O3) possessed of the ability to
step off a Bentopolis tram-car whilst same is
in not very violent motion. Melbourne cable-
trains run at a fixed speed of about seven miles an
hour (I nearly said “year”); “F.C.” says 12
miles, but writer doesn’t believe that anything
runs as fast as that in Yarratown, unless it be
Thomas Bent in pursuit of an engine-driver to cut
down his wages. It takes a real smart hand, how-
ever, whether male or female, to alight from a
Sydney electric - tram whilst same is “ all
out” on the down-grade. I knew one girl,
though, who regularly climbed down opposite her
shop-door, midway between King and Market
streets, with the same airy grace with which a
fly steps off an elephant. She always got off on
the wrong side. One day, she forgot the up-car
on the other track, and she died shortly after-
wards in Macquarie-st. hospital. She left no
successor in the business.

“ Cheetah ” : Met an innocent old dame
the other week when journeying per Bent’s
rockibus-cum-puff-creaker to the city. She told
me that she hadn’t seen the metropolis since the
“happening” of her third kid—33 years ago!
I’m afraid I told the poor old soul a dreadful lot
of lies. I know for certain that I told her Bent
was a slender, kind-hearted man about 6ft. high.
When we reached Spencer-street I helped her out
with her carpet-bag (a treasure saved from her
last trip to the city, 33 years ago), and a candle-
box containing three chicken roosters, a present
for her sister’s children. She was being sent,
along with the rest of the starving stock, to
Gippsland, till things improved round the ’Maine,
she said (she hailed from Castlemaine), and was
bound for Wy Yung. Went to send a wire, and
when I got to Collins-street found her looking
very lonely. “I’ve been waiting,” she said, with
a quiver in her voice, “ for them to put the horses
in them carriages, but they whip off without
them!” She’d never seen cable trams before.
Then I took her in hand, and piloted her to the
Victoria Coffee Palace —carpet-bag, roosters and
all, for the night—and left her (4.30 p.m.) on the
steps ringing the bell!

A single man who applied recently to a
Brisbane charity organisation for relief put his
case thus :
(1) He had never been employed by anyone for long.
(2) Whenever he got a job some one would libel him to
his employer. Result —the sack.
(3) A certain gentleman would be willing to give him
regular employment-only he was dead.
When one’s only hope of a regular job is in the
cemetery the case is a hard one.
The Que-en Victoria Memorial in Mel-
bourne is commissioned to James. White, the
Sydney sculptor, on a .£6OOO contract. The
artist’s original design, estimated to cost £BOOO,
will be carried out m cheaper material—copper
repousse instead of bronze for the figure, and
freestone instead of granite for the base. These
proposed economies are a painful reflection on
the sincerity of national “loyalty.” Bobbie
Burns, Scott, and William Wallace (especially
Wallace) have been dead a long time, yet there
is no difficulty in raising a couple of thousand
pounds for a statue to any one of those deceased
Scotsmen nowadays. Queen Victoria’s death
reduced the Victorian community to a state
of mourning some two years back, and a
memorial fund of nearly £6OOO soon resulted from
the appeal of an officially grief-stricken com-
mittee. But already the late monarch is as dead
as Queen Anne. Another .£2OOO would enable
the memorial sculptor to execute his design in
handsome style, yet “it is thought improbable
that the deficit could be raised by re-opening the
subscription list.”

Lyttelton (M.L.) took its sinall-pox visit
very seriously. The State health officer rushed
down from Wellington by special steamer,
arrived about 4 a.m., and got the local paper to
run out a special with a vaccination proclama-
tion. The lumpers at Lyttelton, who had
handled cargo out of the Gracchus, were ordered
to be lymphed, and when they objected were
given the option of 21 days’ quarantine. So they
accepted, and got the sop of three-days’ extra
pay. Their clothes were taken away in a disin-
fected cart, and burned in the furnace at the
waterworks. Disinfecting parties raided the
houses of suspected “ contacts,” smoked out the
inhabitants, commandeered their suits and petti-
coats, and cremated them in the backyards.
Government replaced incinerated costumes at its
own cost. The Gracchus crew, including 72
Lascars, were carted to Quail Island in sterilised
boats. There they had to strip and stack their
garments at a given spot, and run in the nude to
a clothes heap about a quarter of a mile away.
And, after all, that is the best way to treat a
disease such as small-pox—seriously.

In a case where a milkman was charged
with stealing a milk-can at Melbourne t’other day
a rather cool custom came to light. Accused
stated that one of his customers had forgotten to
leave out a can for his morning’s supply, and he
had taken the can from prosecutor’s verandah
rather than awaken the neglectful one and ask for
a vessel. He said that it was quite the recognised
custom for milk-carters to take a non-customer’s
can from the gate or verandah in such cases. His
employer confirmed this statement in all good
faith, and was almost doubled up with amazement
and wrath when an unsympathetic beak fined him
£1 for the theft. Apparently the milkman is
almost like an importer.
BY FAR THE QUICKEST.
THE QUICK ONE : “ How can I get into the
hospital, sir?”
POLICEMAN : “ Well, it all depends. If you want
to get there quick you'd better drop dead —
that's the only way.”
The Australian Tommy (permanent man)

the battery steak for breakfast! On the first
steak morning, the “cook’s mate,” carrying a
glad, proud expression and steak, had just entered
the messroom when 20 hungry men sprang at him.
He dropped the dish and ran, and the men had a
riot on the floor. Penalty—Bread-and-scrape for

Rushcufcter’s Bay Park, Sydney, a portion
of which is now to be
built on, earned an
evil reputation at
the very opening
of the convict era.
The water of the
bay at that time
covered most of
the park, the
place being a
mere swamp
with a fringe
of rushes.
Phillip sent
a party of
convicts to f
cut rushes
there one
day, and
they perpe-
trated acrime '
on five abo-
riginal
women which
ranks as one of
the prize horrors of Austra-
lian history. The next rush-
cutting party, consisting ol
six convicts and two soldiers,
was ambushed and slaugh-
tered by the natives. Then
more soldiers were sent, and the aboriginals
round the bay were butchered promiscuously.
The bay ought to be a ghost-haunted spot; an
awful amount of tragedy was condensed there-
abouts.

Arrangements have been made at the new

preserving the dignity of the “Inner ’’ Bar. The

The Westralian Inner Bar consists of only four

is at present almost out of practice ; Pennyfather,
who got a sort of ex-officio K.C.-ship, as Attorney-

up a pickaxe to her husband when he came home,
the Old Buffer’s severe use of an axe-handle upon
her was held by the Court to be a natural and
proper proceeding. This is a pretty cold world
for the Old Buffer sometimes.

Watching the sunset pass ;

Under our feet the grass.
Down by the pool where waters cool
Mirrored the spangled sky,
Over the sliprails I kissed her then,
Kissed her and said good-bye.
Over the sliprails I lean to-night
Watching the sunset pass ;
By the waters deep she lies asleep,
Over her head the grass.
Over her head the grasses spread
Tangled and rank and dense ;
Ah ! she may not know where she lies below,
Down by the stockyard fence.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, June 2, 1903.
Mr Dear Arini,—
There was a small attendance of women at
A.J.C. Prince of Wales Birthday meetings on
Saturday and Monday. Frocks were mostly of
the hairy zibelines and shaggy skye-terrier tweeds.
Which reminds me of a Great Smoke jokelet.
Motorists there affect overcoats which were first
the property of some animal with hair like Ham-
bourg’s—a Shetland foal, a Persian lamb, or a bear.
A coster, after watching an automobilist getting
into a huge, hairy garment, exclaimed, admiringly,
“ It’s lovely, matey ! Cut us off a pup.” One of
our best known good-dressers wore a big, flat hat
laden with a harvest of scarlet hawthorn berries.
Another good dresser, but a woman of no impor-
tance, carried a facsimile of it, and it is safe to
predict that one at least of those women cast off
her bird-food trimming for some other form of
decoration soon after she got home.
I want to start an association for the Advance-
ment of Assassination, or I desire to be, for one
hour, that Beast in Revelations who had seven
heads and 10 horns. My first midnight dagger,
or my first rush, like a numerous rhinoceros, would
be directed against Mr. O’Sullivan—for one reason
only. He has set his myrmidons on to cut down the
scented scrub, the odorous shrubs, the sapling
gums and native fuchsias that make beautiful the
Spit Road and Middle Harbor foreshores where
the punt punts. The Minister for Works —there’s
no doubt about his thriftiness —will use the cleared
spaces for advertising hoardings to help bring in
revenue. Tenor Edward Lloyd, for instance, said
the Spit Road, with its fine sea view and
its curly descent to Middle Harbor, was
worth the journey to Sydney. Every week thou-
sands of sightseers go down there and pay the
tram and punt fares. But who will do the journey
for pleasure when the route is disfigured by
advertising hoardings ! Why can’t the Minister
spare the scrub and put a tax on feet instead ? A
decimal of a halfpenny on feet —both feet, all four
feet —would bring in millions.
From the time he returns from his cruise, State
Ex. Rawson and wife are booked for engagements
right into September. On the 3rd and 4th of that
month the grounds of Cranbrook will be given
over to the District Nursing Association to run a
charity fete, or some such jamboree.
As to the Canadian actress now visiting us—in
the multitude of (rumored) suitors there is safety.
You hear remarks like this : “ She’s engaged to a
man with a lovely motor-car ! ” “No, it’s not to
that one ; it’s to a man with a little black
moustache.”
Concerning that Sydney small boy who watched
his mate drowning, then walked off and said
nothing to anyone of the tragedy; Solomon left
it on record that there were three things which
were “too wonderful for him ; yea, four, which he
knew not.” Then he propounds his puzzles, which
are not worth guessing. If his “ wonder ” had
gone to five things, and the fifth had been the mind
of a child, it would be worth more consideration
than all the other four together, “He just
splashed about for a bit, singing out,” said the
dead boy’s mate; “then sank.” The boy, when
confronted with the police, said he confided the
story to his mother and that she threatened him
with a beating if he told anyone. The mother
denied all knowledge of it, and those who have
kept any register of the workings of their own
childish minds will believe her. Fear—an obscure
dread of being considered accessory to the boy’s
death and therefore deserving of punishment—
kept the lad silent to the person who might inflict
the punishment. But if he had met another small
boy, a friend of his and of the drowned lad,
he would almost to a certainty have confided the
secret to him. It was too weighty to carry alone
for long. There must have been a keen struggle
between the boy’s physical fear and his natural
childish desire to be the centre of a dramatic
situation. The biographer of the mind of a child
has yet to come.
In a recent visit to a kindergarten, Lady Tenny-
son referred approvingly to the fact that caning
and other forms of physical punishment have no
place in the Froebel kindergarten system. This is
cheerful reading ; we are getting away from the
corrosive belief that the more you wallop your
son the better you work out his salvation.
“The superior quarrelsomeness of women.” An
English Judge used the phrase when commenting
on the number of trumpery dressmaking disputes
brought before him. It was a most unusual thing,
he said, for him to have cases between tailors and
their customers, and he complimented the male
person on his inferior quarrelsomeness. A com-
mentator suggests as a possible explanation the
superior skill of the tailor to that of the dress-
maker. A curious little fact which somewhat
bears out the Judge’s suggestion is the number of
compulsory apologies that appear in the daily
(Sydney) press. Almost without exception women
are concerned : “I, Mrs. Smith, apologise to Miss
Brown for the things I said about her to Mrs.
Jones, the same being without foundation.” Pro-
bably men would settle the slander with their
fists. Women use the tonguwand the “Beak.”
In “Are You a Mason” and “ O, What a
Night! ” (the latter now in its last days at Sydney
Palace) we have two plays in which the central
idea is the deception by their husbands of suspi-
cious, nagging wives. Audiences go into spasms
of laughter at the make shifts, the stratagems
and the cowardice of the male in his efforts to
outwit his worse half. As to the husband being
master in his own house, in comedy that is but a
phrase, with moths, not truth, in it. To see
someone good-naturedly fooled you should see
“ Oh, What a Night! ” Miss Munro’s Xantip-
Seism in her version of the devoted thorn-in-the-
esh wife is so realistic, that one finds oneself
wondering if the old Hebrew who sought one
woman in a thousand and didn’t find her had a
harem of such wives as Mrs. Paillard. As in the
“ Mason,” MissMollison fills in “ What a Night ”
a pretty, yet unimportant role. In appearance
Miss M. reminds me of Julie le Breton, the heroine
of Mrs. Ward’s “ Lady Rose’s Daughter.” Mrs.
Ward constantly reminds you of the incomparable
Julie’s thinness—her “miraculous slenderness.”
She seems to insist upon it as one of the rarest of
charms when associated with grace, and in the
illustration of the story, Julie’s white attenuated
arms and the delicate bones of her chest and neck
are as much in evidence as Miss Mollison’s when
she wears, in the “Night,” an evening dress of
pale-green spindrifty fabric, almost dropping off
her ethereal shoulders.
The four school girls in the “Night,” with
their blue blouses, dark skirts, sailor-hats, satchels
and floating hair, are real chocolate creams. The
tallest of the four is Ethel Gunn, a Melbourne
girl.
Sydney National Gallery trustees hung a new
picture last week. It is one of Alfred East’s
serene, poetic oils, the “Valley of the Lam-
bourne.” A large canvas, soft blue sky with
white clouds, deep blue hills, great trees to left
and right of the sluggish river, a red farm house,
a Riverina-looking gate, and white ducks, not
swans, paddling in the deeply-shadowed water.
The piece has an early-summer afternoon air of
drowsy calm. East was the first English painter
to go to Japan and make extensive studies of the
Jap. national life and landscape.
There have been some inquiries as to the iden-
tity of the Mr. Foster of Sydney who has just sold
areputed Gainsborough in London for 900 guineas.
Trustees of the N.G. say that they had heard, on
good authority, that there was such a picture in
Sydney, but that they had never seen it or its
owner. It is stranger than fiction the way a few
valuable pictures or engravings find their way to
Australia. A well-known Sydney man had re-
cently sent him from Melbourne by one of his agents
a box of “old paper pictures,” bought for a few
shillings in a local auction mart from amongst the
effects of a deceased missionary—a very old man
who had missioned and died on one of the South
Sea Islands. Well, “ the paper pictures ” (there
are about three hundred of them) turn out to be
valuable engravings illustrating the engraver’s art
from the earliest times till now, and covering a
period of four or five centuries. One is by Lucas
van Leyden, and is dated 1494.
“Elamang,” the Milson’s Point estate of the
late James Milson, was auctioned last Saturday.
Fifteen acres of valuable site. It fetched from £6
to £l2 15s. a foot frontage. But the big stone
house was passed at a reserve of £7500. Curiously
enough, an evening paper of the same date as
that of the land sale, in mentioning old time
Sydney memories, chronicles a yacht race of 50
years ago. with James Milson, jun., as umpire.
The “ junior ’’ is identical with the handsome old
man who died lately, aged over 80.
A new disease has fallen upon the life of man,
but only a few will be afflicted with it. 1.5.0. it
is named, and a batch of gentlemen in all States
of the Commonwealth are the first sufferers.
Someone who isn’t tired will soon give it a mean-
ing other than Imperial Service Order. In
S’Africa during the war the C.l.V.’s were known
contemptuously as the “ Can I Ventures.”
A certain Sydney. hostess is qualifying for a
padded cell, so .mad is she at the action of the
young gentleman who quitted her large and
valuable dinner-party at the finger-bowl period in
favor of a Golden Gate contest between the
Terrible Turk and the Speckled Gosling. She
has been trying to induce other hostesses to
boycott him. Very likely, indeed ! Why, he
owns a motor-car.
Such a flax-on-fire state of excitement over an
incident in the honeymoon of a diamond-dusted
Australian bride and groom. Groom jumped or
fell out of an upper storey window what time the
graveyards yawn. Dense shrubs saved him from
death or broken bones ; as it was, he was severely
scratched. His friends say that he is a sleep-
walker.
St. Vincent’s Hospital ball occurs on Tuesday,
the 9th. It promises to be as brilliant as a
meteor. Hon. secs., Mrs. Tom Dalton and Mrs.
O’Gorman-Hughes.
One of the worthiest charities Sydney possesses,
the Montefiore Home for Aged and Infirm Poor,
will help its funds with a ball on June 11; hon.

Melbourne J. Macnamara, whose sudden death
on his way to London last week shocked his many
friends, started practice a quarter of a century
ago at Deniliquin. In 1883 he opened in Sydney,
and in the intervening 20 years got together a fine
practice. He kept away from politics, and left
public questions severely alone; he was tactful
and full of common sense, and the result was
financial success. In nearly all the big trans-
actions of Sydney during the last ten years Mr.
Macnamara had a finger, and he and" his wife
figured at all prominent social functions. Outside
his profession Macnamara found amusement on
the turf, and what he did not know about horse-
racing would hardly be worth troubling about.
One of our society women who has a Napoleonic
talent for making use of other people and their
chattels, came away from a friend’s afternoon
at-home lately, and calmly stepped into a private
carriage which was waiting outside the gate.
Coachman and footman looked at her in amaze-
ment, never having seen her visiting at their
missus’ place, but she drew the rug over her ample
knees and ordered them to drive her to , as
their mistress would not be out for another half-
hour. They did so, but the carriage was scarcely
out of sight when its owner required it. Her
indignation was of the speechless kind, for she
had only a how-d’ye-doing acquaintance with the
carriage-snapper.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ The Cliveden widow, ’tis said, laughs at the
pity lavished on her newly-married daughter by
some of the latter’s dearest friends on the score
of the bride’s probable ‘wiping-out’ when she
comes to spread her plumes (regarded so reveren-
tially here) on the same terrace as the dazzlers of
Russian diplomatic circles. Fears on the new
Mrs. Lindsay’s behalf do seem rather groundless.
Not to speak of her substantial private income,
the Australienne is equipped for the dress-fray
with nearly two thousand pounds’ worth of ex-royal
lace, willed to her by her late father. Her bride-
groom’s people armed her with a tiara of diamonds
and sapphires, necklet of diamonds, and betrothal
ring of ‘ ancestral brilliants,’ while her husband
contributed pearls, and her own mother more
diamonds. A group of Australian kinsfolk
donated cheques, to be spent in impressive furs
when the recipient gets to Europe.
“The adoption of babies by fashionable and
naturally unencumbered dames has proved in
many cases more than a nine days wonder. One
western adopter, who brought her borrowed infant
from the Big Smoke, boasts that she has now spent
£3OO on its swaddling clothes. Friends help to
pamper the child who can only, so far, turn wide
blinking eyes on the corals and the golden baubles
that glitter in its crib and go-cart. It is an
endless source of joy to the sporting dame, and
her dogs are dismissed from heel when nurse and
the London baby come into sight. In another
case, a practical dame is going to bring up the
child by a patent system which is guaranteed to
turn out a perfect article from all points of view.
Poor woman ! Poor infant !
“ An old lady describes our late Jap visitors as
* rather coarse. ’ She had asked several of them,
so she said, how they liked the English style of
evening dress for ladies. In each case the reply
was something like ‘ltch-kuma.’ That is Jap
for ‘very nice,’ I’m told ; but the ancient dame
said the offenders put such stress on ‘ Itch ’
that she was driven to interpret their meaning as
* ticklesome ’ —which would have been blasphemy,
of course, in connection with the shoulders of
women old enough to be the culprits’ grand-
mothers.
“The smart world attended at Her Majesty’s
Salon on Tuesday noon. Miss Van Buren, whose
great round eyes had been gazing solemnly at us
from choice posters all the week, was billed as
guest, and she guested alluringly—in black. The
Melbourne womankind, with its commissariat
department out of the general drawing, was
perturbed at this gathering to see the beauty’s
abrupt bust and twenty-two inch waist. The
smartest snorted, and scorned the idea of any-
thing but the ‘ straight front.’ With the saucy
Van Buren face there was no quarrel. It is too
much one of pretty appeal and a retrousse charm
—a charm that should make her Madam Sans-
Gene role irresistible. The fine nose has an
uplifting, right at the tip. The mouth is soft.
The chin is pert. A good type of imperfect
beauty.
“Another of the co., Miss Denison, is of the
Ruby Madden type of chubby beauty, and her
up-to-date style included a show of much soft
throat, a little chest, and a cavalier feather that
plunged mid-way from the back of the flat hat-
rim. A stout male comedian, with a highly-
polished and rather pinkish pate, was the laugh-
maker of the day. The Misses Young and Carrie
Moore made a pair of richly upholstered host-
esses, Carrie being quite graceful in black
shimmering raiment, while Florence was struc-
tural in a profusion of fine clothes.
“Melbourne’s gilded youth jests in the Ally
Sloper fashion. When half-a dozen of the species
had pressed Carrie Moore in vain to give just one
more tootle, one of the number urged : ‘ Come
along—you can only clear the room.’ And back
came the hot answer, with a head toss : ‘ Thanks,
I’ll not try.’ Strange how the little stars, who
ought to be sated with the flattery of immature
moths, hotly resent a mothly joke at their
expense. Aide Kilpatrick, off duty, frisked
quite recklessly. Plump Guy Madden beat all
his leaner friends easily in persiflage with stage
girls.
“ A remarkable thing about that theatrical
‘At Home’ was the complexion competition.
And in this the society girls carried the palm.
From the loftiest stage-star to the obscurest, the
make-up was deplorable. Some had a complete
cream mash, inches thick; others had a high
cheek bloom that Nature had never planted in
such a spot. A few sported a general pinkish
coating that pointed the finger of reproach at the
chrome-colored neck. None of the Society girls
made such garish mistakes. They all showed
beautifully - balanced complexions—ivory skin,
faint cheek flush, soft eye-glow, defined brow-arch.
Over the dainty work an embellishing veil was
drawn, and Nature itself would be deceived at
the borrowed bloom. One smart dame, Mrs.
Ernest Raleigh, who wears her pallor as Provi-
dence sent it, stood apart from all these tinted
Venuses, and yet looked attractive.
“ The Sultan of Johore lent his dusky presence
to the circle of the ‘ Secret Service ’ show on
Saturday night. With him was his white bride
and an Indian brother. The Sultan’s golden
smiles were “ off ” this night. The audience pre-
sented glasses, but the cave of Aladdin remained
closed. Those advertised molar gems have
annoyed his chicory nibs, and he no longer make*
them the beacons of sociability.
“ At that ‘ Secret Service ’ first night, the great
feature of a large, flash audience was the skv
scraper height of the thatches. Down in the
stalls, the Misses Landale (with an aide in towl
soared hairily with their extension frames, until
their two tall hair-buildings made one dizzy to
view. Several of the same smart clan wore their
stuffed thatches at an aggressive altitude And
from these hard, stiff, false-looking structures one
turned with joy to look on the sweet ringletted
charmers moving through the ‘Secret Service’
scenes. Miss Van Buren wore a pair of finger
curls on each side of her neck, the rest being
bound in a ribbon at the back of the head. This
style matched admirably her Sweet Simplicity
tones and French-Canadian charm. Miss Denison
too, broke up the line of ample chest with
two graceful ingenue ringlets; and a tall, fair
inaudible beauty, who occurred too seldom, like-
wise sported the Romney curl.
“ Leon Caron came m for some farewelling favors
on that Friday night. Florence Young threw
him a rose with deadly aim—it hit the baton-
leader on the first vest button. He was equal to
the occasion and chivalrously pressed the scented
shot to his lips. Then Carrie Moore pelted a
handful of her presentation blooms, and George
Lauri finished the deal with a blow of a bouquet.
“There is plenty of talent among the Jap
middies. Several have sketch-books furnished to
date. One good-looking engineer man has a
charming series of painted views, from a sunrise
in Australian seas to pier-scenes, garden-glimpses,
and 20 color schemes translated to the sketch
E ages during the western trip round. ‘I regret,’
e said, using his English carefully, ‘I cannot
make picturesof Melbourne, where the people are so
kind. Itisacuriousthingllook everywheretomake
a memory-picture of the bay, I cannot. Only in
the Botanical Gardens I see such a pleasant sight
that I have in my heart how to make one picture,
and I will call it, like you poet,
‘The Lady of the Lake.’ You like my idea—is it
not ? Then I shall take much trouble to make it
very, very nice.’ This same Jap sings, dapces,
lectures, and is the poet of the Hashidate.
“At the Wednesday Hambourg matinee, when
a choice audience lent ear to one of the most mag-
netic of all the performances, a stout party was
anxiously guiding Marshall Hall to a coign of
vantage. He lifted his heavy brows in a half-
questioning, half-amused appeal. ‘Why this
trouble?’" *1 want to find a view for the playing.’
He broke out into a huge laugh. ‘Bless you! I
don’t want to see his hands —I want to hear him
play.’ And down he plumped, with his harassed
host, on the nearest perch. But the majority of
the Hambourg devotees showed, at all the con-
certs, an insane desire to pick the seats in view of
the acrobatic hands. I only know one pure wor-
shipper who used to listen with eyes closed, giving
the whole mind to the melodies. The flying
fingers are really a distraction.
“Courtneidge’s one-night resurrection as the
Scotch Professor in ‘On Change’ drew a cordial
crowd. Old admirers came to sample anew the
qualities of their former favorite, while younger
play-goers were interested in the personality of
the manager, who has steered to artistic and
financial success ‘ Midsummer Night’s Dream.’
Mr. Courtneidge, who has not acted these seven
years (since he became manager of the Princess
Theatre, Manchester), seemed nervous enough,
but did not allow his misgivings to dilute the racy
‘ reek ’of his auld Scotch drama. The book-
worm |Dominie (who, when a blatant broker
boasted that he himself would write a book
when he found time, exclaimed in horror:
‘ ‘ Man, ye’re becomin’ blasphemous !”) was
ably supported on Saturday by Nora Kerin
and Cynthia Brooke as giddy, girly wearers
of divers delightful frocks. Miss Cellier, of the
composer’s clan, made her first Melbourne ap-
Searance as a tall, dark stage daughter. Mrs. G.
i. W. Lewis, as usual, made the boards seem
homely and cosy.
“In the d.c. the Cliveden widow headed a
family party, and in her all-white toilette could
only be distinguished from her youngest daughter,
so far as youthfulness of get-up went, by the fact
that Missie’s hair is still hanging down her back.
Mrs. Rupert Carrington sported an impressive
black cloak with chic triple collars of point
lace, gold gimp and black ruching. Barrister
Coldham shared the manager’s box with Mrs.
Courtneidge, her bright, little daughter, and tall,
picturesque Miss Rignold, of the dusky hair and
splendid eyes. Miss Milton, who did Helena in
‘The Dream,’and is regarded by many theatre-
goers as the crack actress of the company, looked
a sensible, blonde lady in sequined wrap of
emerald green and black velvet bow in her
smoothly-coiled fair hair. Her escort was Alfred
Bucklaw, of the Wilson Barrett profile, who, in
‘The Dream,’ took the part of Duke Theseus.
Bottom annexed most notice in the d.c. He’s a
stout, spectacled, reddish comedian—a born
comedian, so far as looks go, with a figure that
looks stiff and stocky with strength.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.


BAD LUNGS.
If your blood is bad, your lungs are bound to suffer. Weak blood means weak lungs—lungs too
feeble to air and purify the blood—too soft and sticky to fight off deadly lung disease.
Then a cold may turn to lung congestion, to pneumonia, pleurisy, influenza or bronchitis—and these
lead straight to hopeless decline and a consumptive’s grave.
Thin blood and bad lungs kill hundreds every Winter. But Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills actually make
new blood pure, warm, rich, red blood. That is the only way to strengthen feeble lungs to fight for life.
Lungs Wrecked Through Pneumonia.. —“ Pneumonia played havoc with my lungs,” says Miss Annie
Morgan, 157 Woolloomooloo-street, Svdne.v. “It robbed me of all my old strength. I was terribly thin, and nothing
seemed able to build me up again. My color vanished, and I grew despondent. I took dozens of emulsions and tonics,
but they all failed to make blood for me At last I tried Dr. Williams’ Pmk Pills, and the first two boxes made me
brighter and stronger and did my lungs a world of good. Three b >xes cured me. Now my lungs are sound and strong.*
Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Queen’s Place, Sydney. 2s. 9d. a box ; six boxes, 15s. 3d. Always in boxes—never in bottles.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
The estate of James Milson, of Elamang,
North Shore, paid £15,634 as probate duty.
Rev. F. W. Macdonald, ex-president of
English Wesleyans, now on his way to Australia
to represent that body in connection with Metho-
dist centenary celebrations, is Blood-bard Kip-
ling’s uncle.
Still attending daily ar his place of busi-
ness, in Adelaide, auctioneer-brewer F. J. Botting,
now 84 years of age. He erected the first wharf
at Port A., and was a director of the first S.A.
building society.
One of the quaintest results of the Yic.
railway strike is the decision of the local Dublin
graduates to have Irvine made an LL.D. “in
recognition of his services.” The idea of an Irish
University honoring a man for coercion is magni-
ficent.
Old Rabbi Davis, a venerable-looking gen-
tleman of 75, who has expounded the law and the
prophets for half-a-century, retired from the
service of the Great Synagogue of Sydney a few
days ago. He has been an eloquent preacher in
Sydney for 41 years.
Four Queensland MinisteTs, Cribb, Leahy,
Philp and Gray (M.L.C.) are registered as share-
holders in the new Brisbane Daily Mail —about
to be launched under the pilotage of Editor
Buzacott. The Courier folks are trying to look
as pleasant as they can.
Gov. Rawson is the first Yice-regal
person to visit Norfolk Island since Hercules
Robinson called in there in ’74. On that occasion
Robinson gained great popularity by reducing the
ruinous fine the men had been called upon to pay
for parentage without marriage.
Solicitor Melbourne J. Macnamara, who
died on the voyage to England, was son of the
Sydney merchant in whose house John Mitchel,
the irreconcilable Irish rebel, found shelter, when
in Sydney, after escaping from Van Diemen’s
Land. Mr. M. J. Macnamara was born in 1853.
The late James Dick, Australian mine-
owner and Glasgow leather-merchant, cut up a
food slice of his million among his employees.
lis managers and clerks got from £3OO to £5OOO
each, his cook £2OOO, every female worker who
had been 30 years in his factory <£3oo, and others
on a scale to correspond. He gave the men who
had been managing his Australian mining inte-
rests the option, in most cases, to purchase them
at a very low price.
THE HUNT COURTEOUS.
“ Well! why do you come home at this time of
the morning? ”
“B’cause ’shtime ’ry ryspechtable poshon washin-
bed!”
A ruffian who received, a long sentence
last week in Brisbane for housebreaking and
stealing, stated proudly that he was a returned
contingenter, and carried a decoration. Strange—
a man gets five years in Queensland for the very
same sort of thing that got him a decoration in
Africa.
N.S.W. Premier See, who has had the
courage to wrest from the daily newspapers the
huge State subsidies they enjoyed so long, is him-
self the largest shareholder in one daily paper
and a considerable shareholder in another, there-
fore he evidently put the public interest before
personal considerations.
Deceased, Mrs. John McPhillamy, of
Mount Tamar, rear Bathurst (N.S.W.), aged 70
years. She was a daughter of the house of
uargin, pioneers of the West with the McPhill-
amys, and was the mother of Mrs. C. E. Pilcher.
Her husband represented West Macquarie in the
reformed Parliament of 1858.
Alleged Freetrader H. J. Saunders, of
Perth, has been appointed by the W. A. Protec-
tionist Premier to the vacancy in the Senate
caused by the retirement of Senator Ewing.
Saunders is generally understood, however, to
have sworn off the fiscal issue till next election, he
being merely a stopgap person.
Democrat Trenwith came well out of the
Vic. strike trouble. After a 30-mile drive from
his Mallee home at Waitchie, and a longer ride on
a railway tricycle, during which he managed to
fall off and damage his back, he reached the
House in time to speak forcibly and vote against
the villainous Strike Suppression Bill.
After all, The Bulletin finds, the parsons
were not so unanimously on the Pontius Pilate
side of the Victorian railway strike issue ; many
of them—a conspicuous example, just brought to
notice, is Rev. W. S. Rollings, of Sale (Vic.)—
spoke out bravely and honestly, but the press, the
lying press, suppressed their speeches.
Mogg, one of the candidates for the late
Capt. Staughton’s seat in Vic. Assembly,
announces himself as a staunch supporter of the
Irvine Government, a protestor against the pie
sent “ high ” rates of income-tax, and Q . strong
opponent of compulsory purchase of land for
closer settlement. And his name is Mogg.
Obit., at Fern Hill, Canterbury, Richard
Smith, late of Sergeant’s Point, Little River,
Braid wood, aged allegedly 107 years. No public
character, whose birth-date can be verified, ever
lives to that age. Among all the sovereigns of
Europe for the last 800 years, among presidents,
peers, people whose lives are insured and so on,
the centenarian is as rare as the dodo.
F. B. Suttor, newly appointed President
of N.S.W. Legislative Council, was, in the 1891
election, returned to Parliament as a Labor can-
didate ! That was the time when Labor looked
like sweeping the polls, and an over-enterprising
election secretary at Bathurst took credit for his
smartness- in securing Suttor’s nomination as a
Labor candidate. The Labor brand was after-
wards repudiated on both sides.
The brutal frankness of Scotland Yard in
describing, for the benefit of the U.S. police,
Whitaker Wright, the Duke of Connaught’s
financial friend, and ex-Westralian boomster :
Charged with fraud, Whitaker Wright, aged about
fifty ; height about sft. 9in. or lOin. ; stout build, large
head, dark hair and moustache, florid complexion, small
chin, with large, fat roll beneath ; wears golden pince-
nez, with gold chain attached ; speaks with slight Ameri-
can accent.
Once more the rumor is being circulated
that S.A. Judge Boucaut, who is 72 years old,
and has held office for a quarter-century, intends
to retire from the Supreme Court bench, but from
the best possible authority comes an emphatio
denial. One S.A. Judge (Bundey) has sat for
over 18 years, and he will not be entitled to a
pension until 20 years are up. Otherwise, he would
step down, for he is always ill.
From John ’Aynes’ Newsletter, pub-
lished by John ’Aynes’ son, about John ’Aynes’
brother :
In a Westralian court, Haynes, K.C., asked a witness
“ Who killed the sheep ? ” “ Oh, ask the sheep,” inter-
jected Mr. Harney, his legal opponent. “ Very well,”
responded Mr. Haynes, who seems to have the ready wit
of the family , and looking squarely at his legal opponent
—“ Who killed the sheep ? ”
And the modesty of the ’Aynes’ family, too !
Augustine Stow, who died at Adelaide
last week, aged 70, was at the time of his death
Registrar of Probates, Commissioner of Inland
Revenue, Public Trustee, Curator of Convicts’
Estates, Deputy Registrar of Customs, and
Chief Clerk of the Supreme Court. He had
also been M.L.A. for three years, M.L.C. for
three years, Chief Secretary (under Premier
Strangways) for 18 days in 1870, the son of a
parson, and the brother of a Judge. Altogether
he had been a great many things—most of them
things with very little remuneration attached.
Nobody’s reputation was more enhanced
by Vic. railway men’s strike than that of Frank
Anstey, Labor M.P. for East
Bourke Boroughs. Unlike
Dr. Maloney, he didn’t stone-
wall Irvine’s Bill; he analysed
it—and that was the cruellest
thing anybody could do to it.
His speech then got very close
to oratory. In some respects
he showed to even better ad-
vantage at the meeting wl ere
the news of the surrender was
given to the men. White
and quivering with emot.on,
he sprang to the platfoim
when a hostile demonstra-
tion against the two leaders
had begun. He frankly
declared that he believed
they had made a mistake;
but with a fine burst of rugged
eloquence he pleaded with
them not to be disloyal to
their leaders. Clean-shaven,
under-sized, a seaman by
trade, Anstey is still well
under 40; with brains ap-
parently as well as a tongue,
he seems marked out to take
a leading place in a party not
too conspicuously well - led
hitherto. He has the further
distinction of having, at the
last elections, scored the greatest
number of votes polled for any
candidate in Vic. His score was 3465.
“ J.S.” meets an old friend :
Met a man just now who thankfully stated that he
had got a Government billet at several shillings a day. A
few years ago he was fairly well-to-do, and purchased
from a well-known politician a bit of land on which to
build a home. When everything was completed and he
had parted with his cash, he found that his new property
belonged to the Grown, and that the vending politician
had not the remotest claim thereto. He was promptly
ejected. He sought the advice of a better-known politi-
cian—a legal one. Politician No. 2 advised costly civil
proceedings against No. 1. After very long litigation,
which exhausted him financially, he got a verdict, but
never managed to collect the money. Politician No. 2
really didn’t know what to do next for his client, beyond
presenting him with a bill for more than twice the sum
originally in dispute. Then plaintiff went bankrupt, and
now in the interval of earning a few shillings a day he
occasionally visits the grave of one of the politicians
above-mentioned —the other is, unfortunately, still alive
—to read the beautiful epitaph.
THE CAPITALIST.
THE WILLING ONE : “ Why, BUI used to say
nothin’ could ever come between you.”
THE UNWILLING ONE : “ Oh, but he’s had half-
a-crown rise since then, an’ now he sez he
can’t be sure a girl loves him for himself
alone.”
F. E. H. W. Krichauff (almost 80 years of
age now) is still to be seen in Adelaide. He was
a member of S. A.’s first State Parliament and 30
years ago was a Minister for 18 solid days under
Premier Strangways. S.A. is full of men who
were once Ministers for a week or a month. Two
notable samples were Henry Gawler and Matthew
Moorliouse who climbed to the dizzy eminence of
“hoffis,” lasted just nine days, and never came
back.
It isn’t very surprising that the Vic.
Opposition can’t be bothered with serious political
business. Its alleged leader, Peacock, besides
being Grand Panjandrum of the Freemasons, is
manager of no less than ten Vic. mining cos., be-
sides other prospecting concerns. He only gives
the tip of the tail of his mind to public affairs,
and it isn’t a very strong mind at best. Peacock
has brains without grit. In the days when his
brains were visible Turner and Isaacs supplied
the grit.
George Allen Mansfield, architect, of
Sydney, in an address before the Institute of
Architects, recently said : “I never expect to see
any Federal capital built in my time.” Mr.
Mansfield is getting well on to being an octo-
genarian. He is the son of the Rev. Ralph
Mansfield, who arrived in Sydney in 1820, and
preached in Sydney, Parramatta, Hobart, and
Windsor until 1828. In 1829 he became editor of
the Sydney Gazette, the first newspaper pub-
lished in the State. In 1831 he conducted the
Colonist, in the absence of Dr. Lang ; and from
1841 until his death in 1880 he wrote for the
S. M. Herald, a journal which always had a han-
kering after clerical editors. Rev. Mr. Mansfield
founded the Australian Gaslight Co. in 1836, and
continued its secretary until a year before his
death, when old age obliged him to retire.
“ J.F.D.” writes :
Grantham, lately ousted from his aldermanic seat in
Hurstville (N.S.W.) Council, has had an unlucky hunt
after laurels. He unsuccessfully contested East Sydney
in ’9O in the Labor interest. Stood again against Barton,
who came for re-election on being appointed Attorney-
General, again defeated. Tried for municipal honors,
and was defeated twice at Hurstville. Then he stood
against ex-Ma.vor Sproule, and at last got in. But to
make his election as sure as possible he cast his own vote,
with the result that the wily Sproule ousted him from
his seat on the grounds that he entered the polling-booth
while the voting was in progress.
“ H.V.” writes :
The Hon. (or moderately Hon.) Thomas Bent, until the
effects of office-holding got him, always boasted of being,
as he termed it, a working man. In the 70’s, Tommy
bragged, in front of a crowd, thus : “Look at me, men •
I’m a market-gardener, and proud of it.” In the 80’s’
when Tommy held office, he went out to some pick-and-
shovel relief works for the unemployed. One man. on
grumbling at the poor pay, had his shovel taken out of
his hand by the Ministerial cabbage-grower, who imme-
diately threw up about a dozen shovelfuls of earth in
double quick time, remarking, “ That’s the way to do it,
my man.” “Yes,” replied the laborer, “That’s all very
well for 30 seconds, Mr. Bent, but how long could you
keep it upTommy walked away.
J. A. Thomson, who has just
refused the vacant W. A. Senatorship,
was for many years one of the
hardest battlers for a Parlia-
mentary position that the
State has known. He always
ran against the strongest men
he could pick out, hence his
ill-luck. In 1899 he fought
an uphill fight with the
late Judge (then bar-
rister and politician)
Moorhead for the North
Murchison seat ; fol-
lowing year, he took
on a hopeless contest
for the Perth Legis-
lative Council seat
with George Shen-
ton, President of
the House of Land-
lords ; in January,
1902, he opposed
George Leake,
when the latter
sought re-election,
after accepting
the Premiership
for the second
time. Same year,
he ran for the
Senate, but “just
missed the ’bus ”
the yelping of the
Yellow Pup and the
Jingo ditto being mainly
responsible for his defeat.
The number of Thomson’s other
election-fights passeth the memory
of the present writer. He arrived at
last, a year ago, and sits in the Upper
House for Central Murchison. The Scotch-
man who doesn’t arrive at last is mostly dead.
The dispute between a member of the
Harris family and the N. S.W. Government, re
the land-tax valuation on a portion of the Ultimo
(Sydney) estate, is not the first of its kind. In
this case the contention is that the property
of Margaret Harris was over-valued by the
Crown, tax being claimed on £40,000 ; but, ordin-
arily, the trouble with the Harris family is the
other way about. When John Lackey was Minis-
ter for Works he resumed a portion of the Harris
estate, and offered compensation. The Harris
family claimed £117,382, but ultimately accepted
£30,000. About the same time Miss May Harris
relinquished a slice for the Darling Harbor rail-
way and demanded £21,912, but consented to take
£5125.
The daily papers ignored a funny speech
made during the strike by a barracker of
Sydney Employers’ Federation. The old man
shouted:— : “The world is governed by the
rule of three. Physicists tell us that every-
thing has length, breadth, and thickness.
Then there is the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost in religion. So it is with commercial
and industrial enterprise. There is the capitalist,
the middleman, and the worker.” This old per-
son deserves to be remembered as the first man
who has had the courage to openly describe ex-
’bus boss Carey and God as two persons who are,
in a manner of speaking, in the same line of
business.
John Perry, recently deceased at Heath*
cote (Vic.), aged 95, had a variegated career.
Born in Essex (England), he became a cadet in
the East India Co.’s service at the age of 14.
Afterwards served in the navy for 30 years, part
of the time under Chas. Hotham before the latter
was made Governor of Victoria. Perry held a
’42 medal for service in the Chinese war, where he
received a musket ball in the thigh. He was on
active service in India, and was presented with a
handsome medal by Pope Pio Nono, who was on
his man-of-war for protection during the Italian
troubles. Old Perry was especially proud of
having borne Queen Victoria in his arms ; he
lifted her out of a boat when she was a little girl.
In ’53 he reached Victoria, and pioneered the
M‘lvor goldfield. He was a postman for 23 years,
and retired on his pension 21 years ago.
There was not an atom of ham-frill about
Judge Williams when he presided over Maori land
Arbitration Court. He sat in ordinary rig-out,
discarding wig and gown, and never troubled
over small points. His successor. Judge Cooper,
is quite another make of bicycle. His freezing
dignity, and his insistence on rigid Supreme
Court etiquette and on the deference due to his
exalted position are really appalling. One day
recently some irreverent individual chipped in
during a case, and wanted to know when on
earth Cooper was going to give his decision on
some malodorous fellmongery biz. The flabber-
gasted Judge sat erect, looked daggers at his
questioner, and said in cold, halting tones that
if counsel were present on the morrow (properly
robed) lie would give it. If they weren’t there
(prooerlv robed), he wouldn’t do so until they
wete. This pronouncement had such an awesome
effect that the chap who was arguing about the
hours in the bread and bun trade couldn’t gather
his scattered wits for at least five minutes.

Aboriginalities.
To Contributors.— In the case of ethnological and
natural history items, etc., always give date and
place of experience ;or as nearly as possible. Thus
many interesting observations will have scientific
value.
This reads like the usual agricultural lie :
The distribution of seed-wheat and fodder to needy
N.S.W. cookies is too much hampered by red-tapeism to
be of much practical aid. A printed form and declaration
is first sent to the applicant; this makes a searching in-
quiry into his circumstances. When returned to the
Department it rests fora couple of weeks, then is sent on
for report to the local “ trap ” who is too tired during the
hot weather to make any inquiry at all. As a rule he
judges the applicant’s opulence by the number of times
he comes to town, say in three weeks —if he comes in
more than twice the “ trap ’’ reckons he can do without
seed-wheat, and so reports. Even if the report is favor-
able the Department forgets all about it, and the appli-
cant gets left in either instance.
Under these circumstances it is obvious that no
seed-wheat at all is distributed. Then where did
all the seed that was distributed go to ?

“T. ” : In the seventies, in a small
mining township on the west coast of Maoriland,
the Argus was run by an enterprising Irish
pressman. As a curiosity I kept a copy!
The proprietor, editor, compositor, printer,
and deliverer of this organ were one and
the same person. He told me he would
have called it the Times, but he had not a
big capital T. It was a single sheet,
printed on the one side, and the price
sixpence. The staff—the proprietor—
called for the paper on Monday, and the
next week’s issue was printed on the
blank side. The orthography was erratic.
Punctuation was ignored. The final letter
of a word, as often as not, was a capital.
Through over-work the editor was occa-
sionally unable to perform his multitu-
dinous duties. On such occasions the
Argus announced in big caps., “ OWING
TO THE INDISPOSITION OF THE
EDITOR THERE WILL BE NO
ISSUE THIS WEEK.” This was
distributed amongst the diggers by
the staff and sixpence paid for it.
" The last I saw of this all-round pre-
ssman was 24 years ago, when he was
wheeling his printing plant in a
barrow across Spooner’s Range to
Motueka, where he sold it for a few
pounds.
“ Deeby ” : The dying-out of the Aus-
tralian aborigines is generally attributed to the
effects of “ civilised ” vices. But most of the
deaths amongst the blacks result from pulmonary
complaints, contracted through having substituted
for the practically non-absorbent native skins the
“ Gov’inent blanket, ” which, when used as bedding
on damp ground, is deadly. Also, many deaths
result from hydatids, due to intimate association
with mongrel dogs.
“Kelm Scott”: Re aboriginal Hebrews
(B. 28/2/’03): In the Roebourne district (W.A.)
circumcision was certainly practised among
several tribes some years ago. I saw two
nigs, on Millstream station (80 miles nor’-east
from Roebourne) who had been circumcised, and
seeing is believing. Lockyer (a half-easte) de-
scribed the ceremony, and informed me that it
was a pretty general thing among four tribes in
that locality when he was a boy. Also, nor’-
west nigs, won’t eat bacon or pork; as a rule
they make a pretence of doing so, but it invari-
ably goes to their dogs. Asked several the
reason, and the usual answer was “No good to
eat.” They couldn’t —or wouldn’t —explain why.
Like Favenc, however, I can’t credit the yarn
about the goats, prayer-book, and Quaker Sunday
business.

From Australian Shooting and Fishing
Annual, 1903:
Those who have travelled much through the country
this last season must have noticed how exceptionally
tame all the little birds were. Starved out, they could
be seen fearlessly seeking food inside houses and in other
unusual places. At one place where I was camped during
the winter quite a bevy of wrens and warblers used to
come about us during meal times, picking the crumbs up
under our feet and hopping on to the table. Before we
left that place we were feeding, besides numerous small
birds, 3 magpies, 2 peewits, and a butcher bird, all of
which had become quite tame.
• * * »
At Milparinka, which is several hundred
miles out at the back of Bourke, and where the
grass is good just now and travelling easy, three
parsons turned up lately on one Sunday. And
the local youngster, who had never seen more
than one at a time before, and then only once
in a year or thereabout, got out into the dust
and stared, and said he didn’t know there
were so many of ’em in the world. He might
have thought it was a circus; only, poor little
beggar, he hasn’t the faintest notion of what
a circus is. Out there, though, when the
parsons do travel in a bunch like that tl.oy
don’t compete. They just parcel out the day—
the morning is Father Hogan’s, and the after-
noon belongs to the pale young man of the
Anglicans, and the Methody fills the even-
ing with warnings of the wrath to come. It’s
a happy arrangement; it allows of each man
taking up a collection from the whole commu-
nity (17, besides dogs). For, of course, the
whole community turns up —and if it likes the
Methody, it’s Methody till the next man comes ;
or if Father Hogan is more persuasive, it’s Holy
Roman.

“ Polstan ” : Tie extermination of black-
fish by perch (“Lin.” B. 7/3/’O2). Only the
common striped perch are so voracious. Writer
has for several years kept gold perch (large ones)
together with blackfish in a pond about 10ft. by
eight, and the blackfish appear to be all there yet.
Striped perch will clean a river out very quickly
by devouring the spawn of the native fish. The
Avoca River is full of very large blackfish and
perch. A small “blackie” is never hooked there
—a sure sign that as soon as the old fish disappear
the river will know no more of them. More’s the
pity. Writer is of opinion that one dish of black-
fish is worth two of perch.

A curious feature in connection with
the earth-eating disease, as noted by Dr.
Macdonald, of Geraldton, is that the adult
victim, with his vitiated appetite, wants, not to
eat dirt, but to drink alcohol. The Bulletin
presents this valuable argument to its Cold Tea
friends. Dr. Macdonald maintains that the dis-
ease, which is due to the presence of a parasite in
the stomach, is already prevalent in N.Q., and is
spreading rapidly.

“C.8.J.”: Can anyone explain what is
the matter with the bees this season? Have
seen dozens of nests, and have found in them
comb only and plenty of bees, lively and in good
working order. No appearance of young bees,
as is usual. Yet the nests are free from moth.
Spencer’s Gulf (S.A.) holds one turtle,
apparently no more—it is quite out of the reptiles’
regular beat. Off and on this lone sample has been
seen for years; he has grown now to be a big
fellow, close on sft. broad. He doesn’t any
longer scurry to get out of the way of passing
vessels as he used to ; so, no doubt, his confidence
and some vandal’s harpoon will be the death of
him before long.

“ Banana ” writes from Ingham, North
Queensland, under date May 10 :
How is this for rain ? From Ist January to date this
year 103£in. have fallen (Bft. 7£in.). March record was
close on 51in. Greatest day’s record (March 27) was
13£in. Geraldton (N.Q.) and Russell River can beat us
easily. Winton and Hughenden have not had sin. yet.
The sugar cookies on the Johnstone last year were
grumbling at only having 74in. for the year. I think
they are satisfied this year.
Charles Kingston’s visit to this piebald land upset all
calculations. The sugar-squeezers and the huge C.S.R.
monopoly were aghast at his splendid reception every-
where. In the big centres of Black Labor he was treated
royally, and Queensland looks on him as the principal
Australian statesman of the day. No politician ever
created a better impression in this land of mongrel races.
Our State Treasurer has been up here on Kingston’s heels,
but the chilling reception he received must have dis-
heartened the lovers of the cheap Kanaka. There are
hundreds of men unemployed walking about the North
who are only too willing to work among the cane, but
the farmers will not give them a show ; they are holding
on like grim death to their pet Asiatic and Kanaka.
These do all sorts of work for the Colonial Sugar Co.,
even to navvying on the line, and about 90 per cent, of
the pubs, in the North employ Japs and Chinese. It is a
pity that white labor should patronise these lovers of the
Yellow Agony.

“ E.S.S.” (of the Richmond River blacks):
Have heard old hands say that, looking up
suddenly while riding, they have seen the trees
black with aborigines, who had a little habit of
perching up in trees like crows, keeping as quiet
as possums, till an unwary whitefellow or a
kangaroo happened along underneath. Either
was game to the watchers.

“ Deeby ” : I met a man the other day
who was travelling through the bush selling
“preventives.” He told me he had met with
some very severe rebuffs, but could put up with
that as he made a good thing out of the business.
When he first started, he said, he used to broach
the subject to men only, but now he generally
avoids men altogether. “ They are too bigoted,”
he explained.

“Weider”: Has any Bulletin reader
ever heard of one calf adopting another. Was
working for a dairyman once, when one of his
cows died from tick fever, leaving a 3-weeks-old
calf. Another calf, a 4-months heifer, thereupon
took charge of the orphan,
which would suck vigorously
at its foster mother’s teats
and bang her about, just as
if it were really getting milk.
The calf is six months old
now, has never been hand-fed,
and is as fat as a pig.
DIFFERENT VALUATIONS.
STRANGER: “I lost a most valuable horse round
here some time ago — er—piebald — er”
SCALPER (abruptly): “That must ’ave bin the
crock Whispering Jimmie shot fer his shoes.”
“Drummer” : What a country of fierce
contrasts it is ! Drove lately from Broken Hill
to Queensland border. For half the way not a
blade of grass; the other half, grass over the
sheeps’ backs. Yet in this latter country the
stock has dwindled from 970,000 to 220,000 in five
years. These three holdings alone—Cobham,
Yancannia, and Wonnaminta—lost 250,000 in one
year. To-day they could run a million and a-half.
This day twelvemonths they may not be fairly
able to run 15,000.

“ Westralian ” : What a farce is our so-
called Government nigger-inspection ! In one
case last year the inspector camped about 10 miles
from the station I was on, and sent along for
some provisions, and to tell the boss that he (the
inspector) would arrive next day. Boss promptly
rounds-up the nigs., gives them “ big pheller tuck-
out,” new pipes, tobacco, dresses, shirts, &c., and
next morning, of course, inspector finds nothing
to reprehend. But no sooner has the official
departed than the clothes, &c., are taken from the
darkies and placed again in the store, to serve the
same purpose at next inspection.
THE LAPSE OF SWIPER JOE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Twas a sawmill in the ranges at the back of old Mirboo,
Where the mountain ash was highest and the mighty
black butt grew,
And the “ circulars ” were buzzing, and the “ verticals "
a-rip,
And death or mutilation only waited for a slip ;
And shakv was the tramway from the siding to the mill,
And the waggons rolled a-down it like loose boulders
down a hill.
But the brakesman was a reckless and a daring sort of
chap
Who for any sort of danger didn’t care a blessed rap.
“Are you ready ? ” “ Right-o I —start’em.” Then we’d
shove and let ’em go,
And the siding—or Gehenna—was the goal of Swiper Joe.
Now, the miller was as grasping and as conscienceless,
I’ll swear,
As anyone that ever sweated toilers anywhere,
And he’d rush us and he’d curse us all the time he
wasn’t boozed,
And wild and weird and blanky was the language that he
used ;
From the sawyers to the pitmen every man was daily
cursed,
But sometimes for variety the order was reversed.
“ Got that blinded order finished? What! condemn yer
lazy souls!
I’d hack ’em with a broad-axe in less time from curly
boles.
Grease them skids, you bloomin’ cows, there 1” and he
kept a-going so ;
But the only man that cursed him in reply was Swiper
Joe.
And when they both got going—well, the engines used to
stop,
And the millmen gape and listen, and the leaves begin
to drop;
And whether these eruptions were the cause I cannot say,
But the scrub around the sawmill had a withered look
and grey.
Joe was sacked and sent a-roaming several times in every
year ;
Then he roamed to the adjacent pub. and sat there
drinking b6er.
And the boss would go a-moping, sulky, silent and de-
pressed,
And fool around at night-time, and he couldn’t eat or
rest;
Then some morning we would miss him and his curses
fluent flow—
And we’d know that he had started on a jamboree with
Joe.
Well, this fighting sort or friendship, or whatever it
might be,
Kept a-growing and increasing both in volume and
degree,
Till a “Simultaneous Mission” drove the devil from
Mirboo;
And among the batch of sinners Swiper Joe was captured,
too.
Then, when the time for cursing in the morning came
around,
And the boss got fairly going, Joseph gazed upon the
ground ;
MIGHT HAVE FINISHED THE JOB.
FARMER DAIRYFED: “Sag, Mister Jinkins; I've
come acrost to ask you to loan me your old
grey mare to finish up my bit of ploughin’.
My old ’oman went and sprained ’er ankle
yisterday, jes’ when we only had four more
acres to finish; an’ I’m a bit too stoutish
myself for anythin’ ’cept drivin'.”
PROOF POSITIVE IN PUSH SOCIETY.
BOTTLE-O GOUDIE: “ I've jest bin dealin ’ out a bit of punch, to me missus.”
BOSS-EYE: “ ’Rout time you did. It’s been gettin ’ round that you two wasn't married at all.”
Not a syllable he uttered till the boss in wonder ceased,
And we saw that he was sobbing, and our interest
increased,
Till the boss in actual trouble showed a heart we didn’t
know,
When he said in shaky accents, “ What’s the bloomin’
matter, Joe?”
But Joseph was repentant, and declared “before his
God ”
That the boss was bound for Sheol, and was “on the
downward road.”
And so skilfully he snuffled, and so saintly he behaved,
That—l’m setting down no fiction—in a week the boss
was “ saved.”
And Joseph kept so holy he w.'.s soon relied upon
As cashier and accountant and paymaster all in one,
While the miller chased the Devil with the parsons round
about,
Till one inauspicious morning he discovered Joe was out,
And had scooted for the regions where the defalcators go.
And now a wicked, cursing boss is on the track of Holy
Joe.

“ Bunny ” : Travelled lately from Broken
Hill to Menindie, Wilcannia, back to Menindie,
down the Darling to Wentworth, 100 miles up the
ana-branch of the Darling, out to Lake Victoria,
partly into Victoria and South Australia, making
numerous trips off the track, then back to Broken
Hill, and saw only one rabbit, no kangaroos, no
emus, no turkeys, and few small birds. The whole
territory is just desert, save for a few deliciously
green patches of warrigal c <bbage, due to an acci-
dental rainfall as unexpected as it was sparse.
THE LATE MAX O’REEL,
Photo, by Falk & Co., Sydney.
Unhappy Broken Hill still has its tongue
hanging out —the rain continues to dodge it merci-
lessly. It has had only one decent sprinkle in
20 months ; for two years its total record is under
7in., and most of that has come in ineffective
driblets of Bor 10 points. There has been m all
this time only enough of a flow into the reservoir
to slightly adulterate the ooze that remains there ;
and even the supply of slightly adulterated ooze
'will give out within about two months if no rain
tomes.

“Z.Z.Z.” (who is “a traveller” by pro-

BUSH STANDARD OF FITNESS.
THE REV. JOSEPH : “ Yes, I heard of Conroy's death. Poor fellow, I'm afraid he was not fit
to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven."
BILLJIM : “Not fit! Great Scot! you should ’o’ seen him sit a bucker!”
Crippa Clarke takes up the brief for the
“ cocky ” :
Hasn’t he any friends ? First, we have “ the ignorant
cocky.” Then “ the unwashed cocky,” and, finally, he
is indignantly described by some hungry bush-drummer
as the “inhospitable cocky.” Well, he may be ignorant
in spots—large spots, if you like. He may be various
other things—but inhospitable? No! So far as his
limited means allow, the average cocky is as hospitable
as the next man. Counted a fair mark for ridicule by
every alleged humorist who is hard up for “copy,” the
cocky is the most misrepresented man in Australia —as
the Punch Irishman is in England. Writer now claims a
free-kick for other side. Cockies’ traducers may be roughly
divided into three classes: (1) The city paragraphist who
has never seen a ‘ ‘ cocky,” but uses the name as local
color for the funny stories he steals from Yankee prints.
He is comparatively harmless. (2) The ultra-democr.ii.ic
swagmen who despise him because he isn’t asquatier,
sponge on him for the meals the squatters often refuse,
and then write to The Bulletin complaining what a
very poor feed it was. (3) The hungry army of bush
“ drummers,” machinery, life and fire insurance agents,
book fiends, sewing machine canvassers, and the gentle-
manly hawkers of alleged tea. On a main road, and off
it for that matter, never a day passes but one to half a
dozen of these uninvited guests drop in for a meal, or a
night’s lodging ; and those on horseback, or in sulkies,
will also require a feed for their mokes. The long-suffering
cocky' is expected to welcome the daily arrival of strange,
non-paying guests with the gratified courtesy of the mana-
ger of the Australia receiving a party of millionaires.
Why, even in Sydney, where it is the recognised custom to
courteously entertain at dinner all the gentlemen who call
during the morning with simples of hearth-stone and
“ wild rabbits,” a citv merchant may occasionally forget
to take home to his table the reduced importer who haunts
his office with bone-studs and shoe-laces, without running
the risk of being held up to public scorn as a degraded
citizen. Why, then, should the humble cocky be always
expected to put aside his work for the day T , and kill the
fatted ’possum for every swivel-eyed book fiend who
wants him to buy “ The Manners and Customs of the
Australian Bull-ant” in 45 vols. And the cheek of some
of these hungry drummers would turn the edge of a meat-
axe. The swagman who asks the charity of a square meal
has quite as good a chance of getting it from the despised
cockv as from any other man ; but hospitality means
more than that, and the bush-dweller, be he cocky or
squatter, reserves that something more for his friends or
for visitors whom he knows by name, at least. Mithin
these limitations, present ivriter, having some 20 odd
years’ experience to guide him, has no hesitation in giving
thelieto those writerswholose no opportunity ofdefaming
a kindly, hard-working class. That there are black sheep,
as in all other grades of society, goes without saying ;
but, taking them by and large, and according to their
limited means, the small farmers of Australia give what
they have to give as freely as any other class. Have
known them, to take the blankets off their own beds in
winter that a guest might lie warm. The man who
accepts the hospitality of a poor man, freely offered, and
then writes to the press about the poverty-stricken ap-
pearance of the table is an unmitigated cad, and gene-
rally a liar to boot.
THE END OF SQUATTER MERINO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A number of persons were fined for failure to send in
their stock returns. Plenty of time has apparently been
given for this purpose, since the time for sin'h returns

The drought was raging fiercely on Merino’s western run,
And the erstwhile rich and mighty Sheeponaire,
When every sheep had perished, and his horses all but
one,
Gave up the hopeless struggle in despair.
“The world is wide, and I have yet my life,” Merino
cried,
“ To measure against Fate and see it through 1
My only one remaining horse,” quoth he, “I’ll mount
and ride,
Into the open world, and start anew.”
Next morning, full of hope, he went to catch his only
steed,
But when, against the homestead paddock gate,
He found that wretched neddv, too, from thirst and
hunger freed,
Merino wept and loudly cursed his fate.
With heart and spirit broken then he slowly staggered
back
Towards his dismal home, and, waiting there,
A-holding up a skeleton that once had been a hack,
He found a man with most officious air.
, 1 You’ll find this summons, sir,” said he, “ for you with-
out a doubt”—
And handed him a bluish document.
Merino asked, in timid tones, what it could be about
Since he had always promptly paid his rent.
“Perhaps you have,” the fellow snarled —"re that I’m
not concerned :
You’ve not sent in your stock-returns this year ;
By way of demonstrating that obedience must be learned
They’ll fine you, sir,'a pound or two, I fear.”
Merino stared and wildly tore the document to bits,
And hurled them at the haughty fellow’s head !
And then he shook and trembled as a man attacked by
fits,
And yelled : " This is too much! ” and then dropped
dead I

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be taken of
communications insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must appear on MS. So liability is under-
taken in any case re contributions voluntanly sub-
mitted, whether sent by post or handed in ; and in
no case will MS. be returned unless stamps (of any
State) accompany.
Penny Winkle : Three different metres in two
verses Pertinax : You say it wasn’t the income-tax
that killed the Lewis Government. Well, vastly worse
Governments than that of Neil Lewis lived many years in
Tas. for no visible reason save that they didn’t levy an
income-tax Uloola : “Cabbages” declined. Will
print “ Tea and Public.” Considering “ Cocky’s Song.”
Phil G. : Not very bad, but still below publication
mark A.T.M. : “Proud Young Lady" no good
Tephi (Toowoomba): The Bulletin doem’t think that, in
the Vic. railway strike matter, its editor is “ the only
educated man in Australia.” Kingston, many members
of the Labor party, Dr. Maloney, the editor of your own
local paper, ditto of the Ballarat paper, and Cardinal
Moran may be set down as educated men. By the way,
you don’t seem educated enough to put sufficient
stamps on your letter, and save us paying 2d. for
a none too legible document. If it was ignorance
we don’t mind; if it was meanness you and your
political friends seem worthy of each other
H.M.P. : The situation is this : Bent says he has dis-
covered through the strike that the Vic. passenger
service can be cut down one-half. Therefore he was
either a fool before who didn’t know he was running twice
as many trains as were needed, or he is a great fool now,
and doesn’t know what he is doing, or he is a medium
sized fool all the time, and rushes from one extreme to
another Jas. N. : Not worth print A.S.M. : Sorry ;
but still unsatisfactory... .Tim D. : Too many syntacti-
cal vicissitudes in it....L0c0: You’re off the track....
Samivel : Condensed to one-third the space, it might go.
.. ..Long Shot : Missed with it, t00....J. M‘C. : Will be
duly returned.... W.M. : Very neat, but tame and blood-
less Warrigal : All third class, except “Venezuela,”
and that’s belated Wun Lung : We couldn’t do any-
thing with it Sairey G. : Construction too flimsy
Robert Emmet : No, thank y0u.... Rei Panes : Will print.
A.U.M. : Your sketch is even worse than the other
man’s verses....R.S. : Autumn poem declined.. .E.M.C.:
“ Soul” is a long metre wail on very conventional lines.
....M.E.L.: Almost undecipherable. Made out “ tomb ”
and “ wine.”.. ..Yanco : The same marks distinguish the
horse-dealer in every part of the world. The horse is a
noble animal, and almost every man who keeps company
with him becomes an unmitigated scoundrel—so far as
his horse-relations go F. : Did Chief Just.ce Madden
ever say anything of the sort? Bitter experience has
taught us not to rely upon anybody’s say-so in such mat-
ters. Send clipping of newspaper report Zingara :
Entirely out of our line, which is not small news long
drawn out T.P.C. : Matter fairly promising; you
should write with ink, not pencil... .Marguerite : You’re
the sort of young lady that should get on : to include in
your first letter a very “ cool ” criticism of The B. and a
description of yourself as a genius points to that
Q.P. : “ Memories ” nearly gets there. “ Amelia ” misses
the target by a hemisphere or two Woodsey : Please
don’t write in dim pencil; use ink J.P.C. : Not a very
promising lot. May use a few Joskin : Clever parody,
but don’t care for parodies as a general thing Muck-
Eater (why such a horrible pen-name ?) : Not good enough
to pyblish ; some signs of merit.... Andy : Certainly.
N.S.W. can borrow from any country that is fool enough
to lend Speewa : The “ photo, of the tree” is just the
natural tree-like arrangement of the branching blood-
vessels A. Roe : Form not bad, but subject hackneyed.
Swod : Neatly told, but not quite in Bulletin line...
Double-F. : Was'ted ingenuity. The “situation” is
almost as old as literature itself... .Anna W. : Graceful
ideas, but verse-skill lacking.... J.B. (Vic.) : Somewhat
improved, but still below mark... Tony :It hasn t a leg
to stand on Will C. : Not wildly enthusiastic about
“Bad Wood.” ...Patric Dare: Will print “Love.”
Gilrooney : “Bushland” accepted... J.G.D. : “Ship of
Liberty” is waterlogged.... D.H.R. : Will print “Night
Riders.”... .F.B. (Woollahra): Both 01d.., .F.B.F. :“A
Reflection ” doesn’t reflect worth a cent, and when a
reflection doesn’t reflect it is just as much good
as an opaque window or a black snowball....
F.N.D. :It very nearly squeezed in Euroa : Nothing
much E.M.C. : Lacks terseness in the telling
Schnee : Not up to the mark S. Burgess :No literary
value. ..Dar Thula: If, as you say yourself, your
“ greatest prison-friend was a man convicted of a revolt-
ing crime,” you would not, of course, be able to sympa-
thise with “ Burglar Bill’s” detestation of foul language.
llex : “H.S.” merely put forward his own impres-
sions. All the arrogant cocksureness appears to be on
your side J.D.M. : For heaven’s sake, cut it short.
That horse-item should have gone in about one-fourth the
words W.B.L. :No use to Bulletin F.H.8.: You
have a glimmer of literary gift, but you lack skill and ex-
perience 0. Wicking : A very juvenile—not to say in-
fantile-production J.J.C. : Two pass out of 21
H.E. : “ Study in Colors” still jolts badly in its
metre....D.M.R.: Not good enough, yet we have met
with much worse.. ..Plymouth Sound: Some humor,
but too crude P. Smith : Too long and too technical..
Tommyjohn : Also tommyrot 1 Sea-weed : Treatment
too ponderous and formal... .Holder: Prose sketches
too illegible for our time. Verses pretty fair, but not
quite up to mark Civis : For one thing we’ll have to
learn to pay municipal officers better. Glasgow’s town
clerk gets £3500 a year C.A.J.T. : Not possible for
Tub Bulletin to embark on that course : but a Sydney
democratic daily on sound lines is now talked of with
much real hope... .Lama: It’s not a point to enlarge
upon M.S.: Don’t like crying out about the poor fight;
the only competent critic on that point is the man
whose job and whose compensation rights were at
stake Veritas : Too ambitious Beth : Well —on
your word—Dungog isn’t a hole, but a Paris and a
Vienna rolled into one. It has to blame its local
correspondents to the Sydney papers for representing
it as a foolish, bumptious little village R.H.B.
(Queensland): Bulletin’s figures were taken from the
latest “ Statistics of the Six States of Australia and
Maoriland ” (published in 1902, page 45). This is a year
later than yours. Despite the “Cash Basis’’, N.S.W.
financial returns are never definitely settled till long
after the year closes, and the latest return has
altered the figures for six years back..
Mulga Tommy : You guarantee the verses Cb be original.
Well, so do we. .. .Georgie Fubr : Too slight, and themes
long ago trodden flat by the large feet of repetition
Fortuna: “Leaves” rather slight Mark Lome:
Metre of “In the Sunshine” rather jagged Charles
K. : Thanks, but we have got all we want.. ..P.B. : De-
clined A.E.1.: Very rocky Solidarity: What’s the
name of the firm ?... .Paddy G. (Cairns) : Glad to hear
that baldness, insanity, and bad teeth weren’t known in
the days before vaccination was invented. Presume you
were there at the time and know.... Hyphen : One may
d0....J.L.: The Jew camped beside the Lebanon range
(10,0')0ft. high); the Carthagenian was between Great
Atlas and the sea, and Great Atlas rises to a height of
15,000 ft. ; the Aztec settled on a table-land about 9000 ft.
high, with a respectable rainfall and little evaporation ;
the Babylonian lived beside two great permanent rivers,
and almost under the shadow of a table-land that rises in
places into mountains 16,000 ft. high. And because agri-
culture prospered in those places you hold that it must
prosper in interior Australia 1

“ Marguerite *’ : Recently attended a de-

of the town struggled with the question :
“Should the sale of intoxicating liquors be pro-
hibited ?” The first young lion got up with a ton
of notes, blushed violently, and spoke :
The lunatic asylums is full of lunatics, the gaols is full
of prisoners, the hospitals is full of sick people—all
through drink. Take up the daily papers every day and
you will find it full of drunkards. A man deserves great
credit for bringing up a large wife and family. If a ipan
stops out drunk all night he does not come home.
Then he sat down, and in his confusion applauded
himself violently.

There is a good deal of talk about the
civil service representatives to be elected for Vic.
State Parliament. Scorer and Hart are bracketted
as likely candidates. Scorer, anyhow, ought to
have a good show. Ex-civil servant Byron Moore
has been suggested, also pensioner Morrah, who
succeeded Moore as Secretary for Lands. But,
after all, the service wants a live man, not a half-
dead pensioner.
Now that Australia is comparatively sober,
will someone draft a Bill providing that all fili-
bustering expenses shall be paid by a direct impost
per head of the whole population, said impost to
be honestly christened “War-tax?” The tax
might be dormant in peace time, but whenever
Australia sends a “contingent” anywhere the
Treasurer should be bound to start collecting it
immediately, without any further Parliamentary
authority, and to keep on collecting it till the
whole war bill is paid.

HOIST WITH HIS OWN PETARD.
A curious instance has recently occurred of how
one is sometimes" hoist with his own petard.”
Some time as:o, the proprietors of Oerebos Table Salt
were prosecuted by the Police Authorities of Paris for
selling salt “ adulterated ” with Phosphates. In order to
settle the legal question definitely, the Company carried
the case right to the highest court of France, the Cour
de Cassation. Having demonstrated there that, far from
being an adulteration, the presence of the phosphates
made Uerebos Salt a valuable addition to the food, the
High Court accorded the Company a triumphant acquittal.
The document upon which the prosecution was based
was the official report and analysis prepared for the police
by the Municipal Laboratory of Paris, and intended to
support the charge of “adulteration.” In a Brochure
just published in French, containing the opinions
of eminent scientists in Paris and elsewhere, the
place of honor is given to this very report, which so clearly
justifies the claim the Cerebos Company make for their
product—though intended to do exactly the reverse—
that they evidently consider they can offer to the public
no better guarantee that their Salt is what it professes to
be, a food as well as a seasoning.*
At the Bar.
It has been the most important event in the
lives of not a few great men when they were called
to the Bar, and to each it has happened but once
in the course of their careers. Thereafter they
have practised at the Bar with honourable dis-
tinction and profit to themselves, as it was fitting
they should do after a long and arduous training
therefor. Another vastly more numerous body of
men also practice at the bar, some very constantly
and with distinction, but always with loss rather
than profit. They do not train for the employ-
ment, nor are they specially “called” to it, but
incline thereto by a sort of natural bias which
they seem powerless to effectively resist. Stay !
What are we discussing? Bars? Why, to be
sure, there are two sorts —one of the law oourts,
another of the hotels.
We once heard a distinguished K.C. assert that
good liquor is better than bad law. We will
concede the point without argument, but are
prepared to maintain that Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup is better than either. Miss
Helena Easton, of 50 Pacific Street, N.S.W.,
found it so. Miss Easton, who has been em-
ployed as barmaid in some of the leading
hotels in the Newcastle district, thus writes on
October 21, 1902: In the summer of 1898, when
residing in Goulburn, my health first gave way. I
lost appetite, and became weak, nervous and
languid. The little food I ate caused dreadful
pains in the chest and stomach, with some other
distressing symptoms. A doctor informed me that
my complaint was acute indigestion, but his treat-
ment did me no good. After a few months I tried
another doctor, with similar result. Then, on the
recommendation of one and another, I took all
kinds of medicines ; but not one of them did me
the least good. For two years I continued to
grow paler, thinner and feebler. The slightest
noise or excitement would cause my heart to pal-
pitate violently, after which it would almost cease
to beat, and I would feel very faint. A lady
friend from Sydney, Mrs. W. Cook, persuaded me
to try Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup, as she knew
several persons who had derived great benefit from
it, and was sure it would do me good. Mrs. Cook
was right. Before I had finished the second bottle
there was a great change in my condition for the
better. I could not only eat, but could enjoy
food ; the roses returned to my cheeks and plump-
ness to my figure. In short, after suffering from
indigestion for over two years, I was completely
cured in five weeks.”

London Truth exposes a new system of
post-mortem blackmail. When some well-to-do
or well-connected person dies a letter is addressed
to him, purporting to come from some woman,
who expresses surprise that she has neither seen
him for some weeks, nor received any money for
household expenses. She trusts he is not ill, and,
with many expressions _of affection, assures him
that our dear baby ”is quite well. Sometimes
it pans out a good deal of money for self and the
dear baby.

“ Yanco ” : A casual Australian strolled
thoughtfully into a wayside pub. and called for
some whisky. On being handed the bottle he
asked for some sugar. While the barmaid was
busy getting this for him he leisurely took a small
parcel from his pocket, carefully unfolded it,
and tenderly placed a great hollow molar
on the bar-counter. He filled his glass with
whisky, filled his one-time tooth with sugar, and,
meditatively at it, said with emphasis,
Now ache, you brute, ache! ” Revenge is
sweet.

One Rogers, a J.P. of Malvern (Vic.),
recently edified Hobart with a lecture on bar-
maids. He was a violent man, and even peaceful
Hobart nearly threw its cobblestones at him
before he was finished. Some extracts from the
Hobart paper report:—
, Some of these hotels employed 12 barmaids. Could
they he properly employed to serve drink—so many of
them? (Interruption.)
He referred to them in many cases as decoys.
(“Shame!”)
The speaker here read a very “strong” letter from an
alleged barmaid, speaking against her vocation and its
temptations. A girl who spent her youth as a barmaid
would probably spend the balance of her life either on
the streets or doing washing. (Interruption.)
He could not repeat the shameful language indulged
in. (Voices: “That’s false. That’s a lie!” And dis-
order.)
The language could not be repeated in that building.
(Disorder.)
Seven-tenths of the barmaids of Launceston lived an
immoral life. (Disorder.)
. It is a fact that in some instances it was made a condi-
tion that the girls should occupy the same bedroom as
the landlords. (A voice : “You ought to be pole-axed.
It is not true.” Disorder.)
Just fancy a Minister of the Crown going round from
house to house with business men of Launceston and
jeering with the girls, and behaving in a most improper
manner. (Loud interruption and cries of “ Who is the
Minister ?”) He would not saj\
About this time several 3 r oung females left the hall.
Mr. Rogers referred to a number of girls in Launceston
who were “nothing better than prostitutes.” (“Oh,”
and great disorder at the back.)
The speaker next told the story of a public servant in
Tasmania W'ho hunted a barmaid from here to Victoria.
He referred to certain barmaids here who went into
certain places where they were confined. (Applause,
and derisive laughter.)
The speaker gave some more anecdotes of a Hawklet
character, and a number of women and girls got up and
precipitately left the hall, amid loud cries from some of
the men to Mr. Rogers of “ You ought to be ashamed of
yourself! ”
Mr. Rogers then told a story about a barmaid “ who
had her fifth child,” etc.
Mr. Blanchard appealed to the chairman, saying he
thought that gentleman ought to ask the young ladies to
go out of the hall, and not listen to such stories as these.
The chairman though the speaker “ should not go so
fully into particulars.” (Applause.)
A number of other girls and women here left the hall.
At this stage more women and girls in large numbers
got up and trooped out of the hall.
The chairman hoped that all the young girls would go
out, and many of them did so, as well as older ones.
The teetotal lecturer at his worst seems about as
morally undressed an entertainment as Australia
possesses.
Anyone that has sore throat
Must know he’s caught a cold,
Our good advice he then should note
And do what he is told ;
Which is—if he has got the sense—

Some Woods’ Great Peppermint Cure.*
Dear Bulletin, —The Brisbane daily
papers the other day contained eulogistic refer-
ences to the test made by the Post Office officials
of an ingenious penny-in-the-slot automatic
stamping machine, invented by a Mr. Holling-
worth and made by a Mr. Jackson. The notices
concluded by the statement that no official decision
had been arrived at, but that the authorities ha,d
erected the machine at the G.P.O. for the public
to decide as to its efficacy or otherwise. The
place where it was to be seen was set forth.
Two days afterwards I went to inspect the
machine. It was not where I expected to find it.
Thought I might have made a mistake, so hunted
all round the buildings—no machine. I had
business at the money order counter, and asked
the cash guardians where I could find the machine.
They were very civil, but did not know—it was
not connected with their department. They
advised me to try at the delivery window. I did.
There they looked for it in pigeon hole M, pigeon
hole S, and pigeon hole P, but could not find it
and said they had never heard of it. They
advised me to try the Dead Letter Office. I
went there and was asked when it was despatched,
and where from, and whether it was sufficiently
stamped, and a lot of other questions. I explained
as well as I could, but it seemed that though the
machine was lost they knew nothing of it in that
branch of the Department. I tried the stamp
issue department but it was not there. The
official in charge had heard of it and did not
think much of it—he did not look as though he
thought much of anything. He could not tell
me where I would be likely to hear of it. I
asked a policeman. He pointed majestically to
a door I had overlooked and said “ You ashk in
there, young mahn, an they’ll be afther tellin yez
ahl about it.” I asked in there and was curtly
told that it was a place from which to send
telegrams, not a public inquiry office. Then I
asked everyone I saw—clerks, accountants,
telegraphists, letter-carriers, mail-cart drivers,
sub-officials, officials, major officials, bosses,
strangers—everybody. No one knew. Finally I
struck a small but intelligent telegraph boy.
“ That penny-in-the-slot merchine ” he said “ Oh,
I’ll shew ’tyer. Come erlonger me,” and he
led me to the spot where I had originally looked
for it, and showed me a mark on the wall and
said “ That’s wher ’twas.” “ But where is it
now ?” I said. “ Lord knows,” he replied.— Ne’er-

The story of creation and destruction and
the beginning and the end of all things :
The Great God rested from His labors, for He had
created many beautiful thing’s and was awearied. On the
high balcony of heaven He rested, smoking His pipe and
contemplating His works. For long mused He ; then*
rising, knocked His pipe on the golden parapet and for a
moment watched the live sparks floating through space
and expiring one by one. And behold, those sparks and
that moment were all of time and the visible universe,
and their burning and dying had compassed the myriads
of generations of men and star-angels—their births ana
deaths—their boundless hopes and fathomless despairs.
And He had seen it all in His glance and felt it all in a
pulse beat And the Great God went again to His labors.

MY HEAVEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
" Our heaven is here, if we only knew
Where to seek for it so a poet said ;
And the bard spoke truth. I have proved it so,
But mine has been here, and it now is fled.
And so little I ask when all is told—
A bridge, a girl, and a moon on high.
So very little, yet all earth’s gold
Will not buy these three, and I’ll tell you why.
There are moons and bridges and girls galore;
There’s but one of each in this heaven of mine ;
The bridge fell a year gone by or more,
And was washed by the floods o’er the border line.
There are moons and girls in abundance still,
But the girl I want in the graveyard lies ;
And a hundred orbs may the domed skies fill,
But the light has gone out of my blinded eyes.

POLITICAL
POINTS
What progress has been made in the
investigation of that alleged gigantic Customs
swindle in New Guinea ?
The dirt-eating disease is said to have
broken out badly in Queensland —just as if our
K.C.M.G.’s haven’t been visibly suffering from it
for the last 30 years.
The most humorous political item wired
from Europe this year is the announcement of
Kaiser Bill’s dismissal of War Minister for
“boundless arrogance.”
A short Bill dealing with rings and trusts
is to be brought forward during the current
session of the Federal Parliament. How the Act
will affect the cable trust of the Australian news-
papers is a question which will be watched with
interest.
If Irvine’s Bill had passed, and Cardinal
Moran had said in Melbourne what he said in
Sydney, Dill Macky might have had the great joy
of seeing Constable O’Hooligan escorting the Red
Hat to Little Bourke st., with no thought of bail
possible.
Owe’Sullivan’s list of the most violent
retrenchers of the House, who are also the most
aggressive cadgers for expensive public works in
their own constituencies, is expected to see the
light during the first night of the forthcoming
censure debate.
The Vic. railway, stationmasters and por-
ters were loyal and didn’t strike. And, after all
Bent’s effusive promises about the reward of
loyalty, almost his first act is to put a large num-
ber of'them on half-pay. Some were only getting
30s. a week, and are now cut down to 15s. ! !
The undignified squabble between the
Federal Representatives and members of the Vic-
torian House of Fat (caused wholly by the inso-
lence of the latter), at the opening of Federal
Parliament, points again to the fact that there is
not room enough in Australia for so many Houses
of Parliament.
Now that the British Tory Government
has declared for old age pensions, Australia’s
ventures in that direction will perhaps cease
to be accounted quite so “ revolutionary ” and
“socialistic”. Surely anyone who calls Balfour
and the Cecil family socialists and red upheavalists
must be off his head.
Chief Commissioner Tait arrived in Mel-
bourne from Canada last week, under the impres-
sion that he had come to be a practical manager
of the Vic. railways. By this time, perhaps, it
has become evident to Tait that a practical
boozer, speechmaker, jobber and hail-politician-
well-met person is the sort of Tait that Bent
wanted.
The height of legal absurdity was nearly
reached, the other day, when a learned counsel
gravely ’asked his Honor to reserve for the Full
Court the point that it had not been proved that
Maoriland was “ a British possession.” And his
Honor, instead of requesting the legal light not to
be a blithering idiot, solemnly noted the point for
future argument.
Melbourne Women’s Political Association
has carried a resolution —
That, being opposed to industrial war, we strongly
urge the passing of an Industrial Arbitration Act.
Same association, which seems to have good,
sound democratic sense, protested against Irvine’s
senseless tyranny in the partial disfranchisement
of the railway servants.
On the N.S.W. railways all manufactured
goods pay an average freight of 14$. per ton for 100
miles while the rate for the farmers’ produce
varies from 3s. to 3s. 8d. On a rough estimate
this is a concession, or grant, or bonus of £800,000 a
year to the farming interest. N.S.W. has always
done this sort of thing, but has always denied that
it protects the farmer in any shape.
Postmaster-General Drake has explained
to a deputation of ex-cohentingenters, doing
temporary duty in the Federal public service,
that even all the hens they stole, and the farms
they burned, and the women and children they
threw out to perish on the cold veldt, don’t con-
stitute reasons why they should be exempt from
the ordinary regulations of the service. Much
dissatisfaction is felt in consequence.
At the Conference of . nagging .. State
Premiers one of the grievances advanced was that
the Australian Government had not yet paid for
buildings and .properties taken over from the
States. The rasping Joe Cook was just
starting to speak about this grievance in the
House, the other day, when Treasurer Turner
flattened him out with the intimation that he had
been asking the States for 12 months to decide
how much they wanted for the properties, and the
bills hadn’t come in even yet.
A point emphasised by the See Govern-
ment in defence of its determination to withdraw
the always illogical and at present illegal subsidy
to the daify newspapers, is that in 1891, when the
Post-office paid the railways for free carriage of
the papers, £2500 a year was fixed upon as the
payment, that being calculated as equivalent to
quarter parcel rates. Since then the railways have
grown and the newspapers have grown, and the
present charge made (£9900 a year) is calculated
on the old basis —quarter parcel rates.
N.S.W. Opposition leader Carruthers
announces that the party he leads is a fresh and
vigorous young party full of life and energy, and
with a great future before it. It may be so, but
to the naked eye it is just the same elderly and
rather slimy Carruthers, the same aged Brunker,
same old Affleck, and Haynes, and Jessep, and
Nelson, and Whiddon, and Young, and Barnabas
O’Conor—same old baldheads and has-beens and
extinct volcanoes.
Ballarat, at the beginning of the railway
strike, raised a huge meeting to denounce
Irvine and Bent. It was the biggest demon-
stration of the strike period, and, in point of
numbers, outweighed almost all the anti strike
demonstrations put together. But the Melbourne
papers suppressed all mention of it, and devoted
the space it should have occupied to relating how
15 sharebrokers met together and approved of
Bent with enthusiasm.
The death of four M.L. Legislative
Councillors—Grace, Swanson, Morris, and Whit-
more—within a few weeks of one another affords
Premier Seddon an opportunity of rewarding
deserving friends. Rumor has it that one or two
promoters of the “national purse” business will
get their reward when the next batch of “lords”
is created. The brewing brotherhood is also
understood to be pressing for more adequate
representation of Beer in the Council.
Dry Dog Reid, throwing his “Yes, Mr.
Watson ” gibe at Premier Barton, says he never
made any bargains with the Labor party when he
was in office in N. S. W. But he was quite willing
to do it, though. When he wanted the tea duty,
and the Labor men didn’t want it, he sent in a
message that he would give them old-age pensions
in 12 months if they would agree to the duty. The
reply was that they would vote for the duty if
their Yes-No friend would give them the pensions
at once, but that they weren’t taking any of his
p.n.’s at 12 months.
Indignant correspondents have been filling
the Perth (W.A.) dailies with wails because none
of the looal Labor members turned up at the
public crawl given to the visiting Jap mariners,
and these absentees are accused of being ignorant
and prejudiced, and are invited to cultivate the
virtues of “their distinguished visitors.” Most
of them, however, are goldfields men, and see so
much of the partially dressed Jap woman as she
leans out of the window and appeals to the passer-
by, that they have little desire to cultivate her
brother’s acquaintance.
NOBODT'S DOG.
Vic. Treasurer Shiels, being urged the
other day to start a public debt sinking fund,
replied : “It is absurd to think that we should
place on this generation the whole burden we incur
on behalf of posterity.” And, on the other hand,
Shiels might note that it is a villainous swindle
for this generation to use up all the public assets
in the shape of State lands, and then leave
posterity to pay the whole bill for public works
that this generation has used till they are worn to
mere scrap iron.
Governor Rawson’s visit to Norfolk Island
was different, in some respects, from that of his
illustrious predecessor, old Governor King.
Almost the first act of King was to order a man
to be led by a halter through the village and given
36 lashes for stealing the doctor’s rum. He
ordered a boy of 15 a hundred lashes, and in-
scribed on the records, “I think it will have a
good effect.” A woman was given 50 lashes for
drink, and 100 lashes next day for stealing shirts,
and another woman got 110 lashes for seditious
language.
“Adelaide”: Curious to see all
the old Female Suffrage jokes and argu-
ments dished up again over the Federal
franchise—all the pictures of women
wearing trousers, and the suggestions
that husband and wife will quarrel
about politics and so break up the
happy home. We went through pre-
cisely the same stage in S.A. about
nine years ago. Women got their
votes, there was the usual difficulty
about enrolment (many of them saying
that they hadn’t asked for a vote, and
wouldn’t use it), all kinds of forecasts
were made as to ultimate results—and
there seems to have been no ultimate
result at all! For several years after
the change the Labor party gained a
few seats; latterly there has been a
slight reaction, but there is nothing to
show that the women’s vote caused
either movement. Woman has got ab-
stract justice in the matter of the
suffrage, and she has got it without _
breaking or losing or demoralising anything.
Though the Vie. railway men’s strike
didn’t cost the unions that were affected a very
great deal of money, it won’t be able to compare
in that respect with the Westralian strike of a
year or two back. The unions that time weren t
called upon for a penny of strike-pay, and the
only expense they had in buying off blacklegs
(which often runs into a lot more money than the
public have any idea of) was that they had to pay
one man’s fare to Bunbury in order to get him out
of the road.
Leader of N.S.W. Opposition Carruthers,
now that the strike is over and sympathy is of no
earthly use: —
He would never deem it necessary nor wise to exas-
perate a body of human beings by doing disagreeable
things in a most disagreeable way, and he thought that
that was a mild way of expressing the opinion of most
unprejudiced men of Mr. Bent’s methods.
When the strike is over and public opinion is
swinging anti-Irvine ! What cowardly minds poli-
tics make.
S.M. Herald the other day assured the
public that next Federal election will be the grave
of the Labor party in Queensland, and that the
party only achieved its successes in 1901 because
of the over-confidence of the other fellows. It
seems just about as probable that the Herald’s
friends will find a grave. McDonald Paterson,
for example, got in at Brisbane by the votes of
2465 people out of 12,980 on the roll, and Edwards
represents 3753 out of a possible 12,277 voters at
Oxley. Such tottering minorities as those are
liable to go at any moment.
Many representatives of the stupid Party
of Fat, who loudly shrieked to the Icicle Govern-
ment to stand firm at all costs during the recent
crisis, are now urging that gang of spoliators and
wreckers to try and close on the funds of the
Drivers’ and Firemen’s Association to compensate
for the loss inflicted on the State when Bent
forced them to strike. Alas ! Another curse come
home to roost! If the Party of Fat had helped
to pass—instead of blocking—an Arbitration Act,
and the enginemen then struck, the Court would
probably have seized the £70,000 as damages—or
a good part of it—as a matter of course.
Bent, it will be remembered, recently
threatened that, if the Victorian railway servants
did not leave the Trades Hall, an order for the
construction of 20 locos.—for which the State
workshops had tendered at the lowest figure—
would be sent abroad. If that threat is fulfilled
now as part of the Government’s revenge on its
servants, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers
(which has branches in every civilised country)
might follow up the order and declare it a
“ black ” job wherever it is sent. The society
could probably block the order at any engine-shop
in the British dominions or in the United States.
Irvine’s infamous Bill, the willingness of
the Vic. Assembly to pass it, and the eagerness of
the Council to rush it through, has thoroughly
alarmed the sleepy democrats of the State.
When they awake they pretty well all go one
way—towards the Labor party. The suburbs are
being dotted with new branches of the political
Labor organisation. If only Syme had not grown
so fat the Liberals might have scored now. But
Peacock stands for Vic. Liberalism to-day—
Peacock ! The man who led the railway men,
not to a compromise, but to an “unconditional
surrender.” Cornelius Job, or Knox of the race-
course hat, or any other obvious Tory could have
done as much for them as that.
“ R.M.,” who is evidently optimistic :
Westralian Labor party proposes running candidates for
all Federal seats except John Forrest’s. The Coolgardie
and Perth representative seats are held with a
firm grip by Mahon and Fowler. Kalgoorlie, which
was lost to the Labor party last election, should
be a safe Labor seat ; and at Fremantle a Labor
man should have no difficulty in ousting the
antediluvian Solomon. The vast extent and scattered
population of Westralia make the Senate seats
a gift to the Labor party. The fattest of fat Senators
couldn’t afford to travel the whole of his electorate, and,
even if he'could, the Federal Electoral Act wouldn’t let
him. The limitation of election expenses makes it im-
possible for a man not backed by an organisation to win
a Senate seat; and, in Westralia, there is only one poli-
tical organisation in sight—and that’s the Labor party.
This (copied from London Daily Mail) is
the sort of thing one finds even in the Common-
wealth’s Foreign-trade press nowadays. (Laun-
ceston Examiner extract):
So far has the fetish of freetrade carried us that in
every walk of life, political, commercial, and private, the
bitter truth is that, in dealing with Britain, you had
better be her enemy than her friend ; that, just as out-
casts of the Fatherland are welcomed in our streets to
make day and night hideous with their music, and all
our best hotels are run by foreigners, so our ships are
largely manned and officered by enemies of the home-
land, who do not scruple to boast openly that their one
end, their one aim, is the downfall of Britain. But since
interference with this undesirable state of affairs means
a tampering with the Shekinah of Freetrade we must
stand aside with bated breath and see our national income
decrease, our expenditure increase, our manufactures
ruined by hostile tariffs, the cream of our trade oversea
filched from us jeeringly. But, unless as a nation we are
doomed, there will be something very like a revolution
before long, when once the significance of present
occurrences has soaked into the minds of our workers.
THE NEXT MOVE—IRVINES REWARD.
The cost of land-stealing ! Britain’s army
and navy cost £35,000,000 in 1895 ; the estimated
cost for 1904 is £64,000,000.
A wearisome cable heading in the Aus-
tralian dailies is—“ Severe strictures by the
Times.” The Vic. engine drivers’ strike was
another occasion for strictures by the pompous
old London journal. Of all newspapers in the
land where the cable liar earns his wages of sin
the Times seems the most constantly troubled
with strictures, and they’re always severe too.
Why can’t the Times indulge in slight strictures,
for a change ?
Sydney Telegraph is wonderfully gritty
and independent with one side of its mouth. It
despises the dependent unemployed
The men of former generations who wrought their own
prosperity and that of this country, did so in the teeth of
great difficulties, and without any thought of calling on
the Government wherever a log had to be shifted off the
path of progress.
But with the other side of its mouth it makes
morning hideous because the Government will
not give a free railway ride to its tons of parcels.
It is only charged even now one-quarter as much
as the draper or grocer pays, but that does not
satisfy it ; it calls on the Government to carry its
wares for nothing.
The Federal Labor party has decided that
it won’t move in the matter of Robert Reid, the
alleged senator, who sits in the Federal Parlia-
ment, despite the fact that his election was
distinctly illegal, and despite the recent con-
viction of his firm for defrauding his country.
The Labor party reckons Reid isn’t its
business. The Bulletin suggests that there
is a great future before any party which
will make the cleanliness and respectability
of politics its business. Also that it is
especially the Labor party’s business to suppress
the bumptious illegalities of its special enemy
Irvine, who unlawfully shoved his political hanger-
on into the Senate.
Amusing to read day by day that “ a
branch of the People’s Reform League was formed,
and officers elected, at Dry Dog Hollow on Thurs-
day night.” It doesn’t mean that there is any
great public “movement” (everythingis “amove-
ment ” nowadays), but merely that the same old
crowd of hucksters have held a meeting and called
certain of their number Secretary, President,
Vice-President, Member of the Executive, Grand-
Delegate, Principal Drunk, and other high-
sounding names. These people will vote just the
same way as they have always done—for the party
M'Millan approves of ; so they don’t represent
any increase of strength for the Carruthers push.
But they are a “branch.”
Apropos of “Joey ” Carruthers’ perpetual
wailings about the “Friedman case,” wasn’t there
an episode connected with the Ministry of which
Carruthers was a member which is much more in
need of resurrection ? Hasn’t the public still a
very ugly recollection that a prominent member
of Parliament (opposed to the Ministry to which
Carruthers belonged) was arrested for no reason
visible to the public, though his partner was cer-
tainly supposed to have broken the law ; that he
was haled to the lock-up on a Saturday afternoon,
and every effort made t > prevent him getting bail,
in which case he would have been locked up over
Sunday ; that the case was pushed to the utmost;
and finally, when the matter came to trial, the
Carruthers gang had no shred of real evidence to
produce against him, and not apparently even a
reasonable suspicion ? Carruthers belonged to the
Ministry which was responsible for that most
disreputable act, and it is one which calls for 100
times more explanation than the Friedman case
does, and which has also been calling a great deal
longer. In fact, the Friedman case doesn’t call
for any explanation and never did.
“ Ilex ” writes :
As a set-off against “ E.G.B.’s" experience (8., 16/5/’O3)
of the treatment of Vic. State school teachers, let me
relate what occurred not 12 months ago. A teacher in
charge of an important school in a mining township made
himself so objectionable generally that some of the
parents interested wrote complaints to the Department.
The correspondent of the alleged Board of Advice refused
to allow his own daughter to attend the school owing to
some improper questions which the teacher had put to
her. One morning the ped. turned up at school with a
damaged countenance which he accounted for by
announcing to the pupils that he had. unintentionally,
collided with a door in the dark, said door being in
reality a man’s fist which had (intentionally) collided
with his face during the progress of a drunken brawl in
the street. Subsequently the ped. was an unwilling
guest of His Majesty, the result of his having insulted
some women in the street. Valueless paper bearing his
name was all over the town. The inspector was sent up,
and he found the school records in complete disorder.
The delinquent was brought before the P.S. Board, but
he wasn’t sacked, or made a “temporary” like “E.G.B.’s”'
acquaintance. He was put in charge of another school
and made to step down one class. He had not such a
long service as the other either, but —he was Grand
Jumbuck of the Order of Foodie Fum, and he had in-
fluence. The Board of Advice correspondent afore-
mentioned was a brother Foodie Fum, which fact had its
importance too.

CURE OF LUNG DISEASE BY
VITADATIO
Singleton, N.S.W., May 30th, 1901.
To Mr. S. A PALMER.
Dear Sir, —My daughter has suffered with Lung Disease
since she was live years ot age. She is now eleven and in
good health, thanks to your valuable medicine. After
trying a great many patent remedies, with varying effect,
I was persuaded to*give VITADATIO a trial, and the im-
provement in her condition was at once noticed by Mrs.
Porter and myself. My daughter has been a great
sufferer, and was given up by the doctors after breaking
a blood vessel about three years ago, the medical man
•remarking that she could not live through the winter,
hut iVITADATIO willed otherwise, as she is now well.
Three years ago she had a bad attack, when she frequently
spat up blood, so I immediately purchased a bottle of
your medicine, with the result that it completely cured
her. You can make any use of this testimonial, as I
would like to see other sufferers benefit by your
appropriately named medicine—VITADATIO. —Yours
truly, -
WILLIAM PORTER, Bootmaker.

Once more the casual Australian. Two
youths went fishing in Sydney harbor and onefeil
in and was drowned before his companion's eyes.
The survivor trudged off home, had his tea, and
then mention d to his mother that his friend had
“fallen in. ’ His mother naturally inquired if he
got his clothes wet, and the son assured her that
he did. A day or two after a policeman called on
the woman, in his search for the missing lad.
The boy was cross-examined, and then he supple-
mented his first remark with the news that when
his companion fell in he never came out again.
The loss of the steamer (Jaklands is ascribed
in some quarters to the fact that she was carrying
a large consignment of tombstones on top of her
coal cargo. Superstitious people object to tomb-
stones and argue that the steamer had encountered
worse storms than this one (she safely weathered
the Maitland gale) for 13 years, and it wasn’t till
the monuments came on board that she went
down. Practical people point out that monu-
ments are unwieldy cargo and liable to shift and
knock a hole in the hull. The most conspicuous
feature of the disaster was its suddenness.
Apparently a big accident of some kind happened
all at once in the interior of the vessel, and the
tombstones are suspected.

Two cases were heard in a Sydney Police
Court last week on one day. One was that of a
book-keeper at a city drapery establishment,
through whose hands thousands of pounds a year
passed, and who was short in his books for some
hundreds. The other was that of the accountant
of a firm of middlemen, whose signature was
unhesitatingly accepted to large cheques. These
unfortunates,'the book-keeper and the accountant,
each received 255. a week, on which hideous
remuneration they had to maintain the dignity of
their positions, hide their misery, and keep up
appearances commensurate with their bosses
incomes—not their own incomes. Is there any-
thing more abject than the dignified, pot-hatted
office serf of a rich trader ?

SICK MADE WELL
WEAK MADE STRONG.
Marvellous Elixir of Life Discovered
by Famous Doctor-Scientist That
Cures Every Known Ailment.
Wonderful Cures are Effected That
Seem Like Miracles Performed—
The Secret of Long Life of
Olden Times Revived.
The Remedy is Free to All Who Send
Name and Address.
After years of patient study, and delving into
the dusty records of the past, as well as following
modern experiments in the realms of medical
science, Dr. James W. Kidd, 4Sfi First National
Bank-building, Fort Wayne, Ind., U. S. A,
DR. JAMES WILLIAM KIDD.
makes the startling announcement that he
has surely discovered the elixir of life. That
he is able with the aid of a mysterious com-
pound, known only to him self, produced as a
result of the years he has spent in searching
for this precious life-giving boon, to cure any
and every disease that is kn own to the human
body. There is no doubt of the doctor’s earnest-
ness in making his claim and the remark-
able cures that he is daily effecting seems to
bear him out very strongly. His theory which
he advances is one of reason and based on
sound experience in a medical practice of many
years. It costs nothing to try his remarkable
“Elixir of Life,” as he calls it, for he sends
it free, to anyone who is a sufferer, in sufficient
quantities to convince of its ability to cure, so
there is absolutely no risk to run. Some of
the cures cited are very remarkable, and but
for reliable witnesses would hardly be credited.
The/ lame have thrown away crutches and
walked about after two or three trials of the
remedy. The sick, given up by home doctors,
have been restored to their families and friends
in perfect health. Rheumatism, neuralgia,
stomach, heart, liver, kidney, blood and skin
diseases and bladder troubles disappear as
toy magic. Headaches, backaches, nervousness,
fevers, consumption, coughs, colds, asthma,
catarrh, bronchitis and all affections of the
throat, lungs or any vital organs are easily
overcome in a space of time that is simply
marvellous.
Partial paralysis, locomotor ataxia, dropsy,
gout, scrofula and piles are quickly and per-
manently removed. It purifies the entire
system, blood and tissues, restores normal
nerve power, circulation and a state of perfect
health is produced at once. To the doctor all
systems are alike and equally affected by this
great “Elixir of Life.” Send for the remedy
to-day. It is free to every sufferer. State what
you want to be cured of and the sure remedy
for it will be sent you free by return mail.
Remember, a letter to America requires 2Jd.
postage. filWrite your name very plain, and be
sure to give your full address, so there can be
no mistake in delivery.
JAYNE’S EXPECTORANT
CURES THE WORBTCOUGH4J


Saved a Leg.
A Queensland man suffering from Blood
Poisoning narrowly escapes losing his leg.
Mr. Arthur F. Muston, suffering from blood
poisoning which would not yield to external
remedies, and who feared he was going to die,
tells of the benefit he derived from taking l)r.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills. He writes:—“l
consider it a duty that you should know, also
the public, of the benefit I have derived from
taking Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. Some two
years ago I was in Townsville, Queensland,
suffering from blood poisoning that caused a
running sore to develop in my right leg which
would not yield to external remedies. I was in
the Rockhamption General Hospital, and later in
the Mackay Hospital, and had an operation per-
formed, and at one time feared I would lose my
leg. About this time Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills came under my notice, and I began taking
them regularly. I was very weak, and thought
I was going to die. After taking them for about
three weeks I noticed a great improvement. I
became more cheerful, and felt quite another man,
the sere rapidly healed, and to-day I am as sound
as a bell. I can safely recommend Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills. In my case I tried several
doctors and numerous other remedies without
getting substantial benefit. There seemed to be
something about the pills that drove the poison
entirely out of my system. I am very thankful
that the pills came under my notice, and I cannot
speak too highly of their blood-purifying and
healing properties.” Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills purify the blood and cleanse the system of
all its impurities. They are a permanent and a
positive cure for biliousness, constipation, and all
liver and kidney disorders. Packed in amber
bottles, and the full name blown thereon.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The export of interesting racehorses to England
and India gives the Australian turf the appearance of a
trial ground for the information of foreign buyers. Two
out of last four winners of the A.J.O. Derby have left the
country, also three out of the last seven Melb. Cup
winners, and one out of the last two Maribyrnong Plate
champions. The latest Caulfield Cup victor has not gone
yet, though he was said to be leaving some time ago, but
Great Scot, the Australian Cup horse, sailed for Bombay
last week.

Sport is booming nowhere as it is booming in
Westralia. The two goldfields clubs, Boulder and Kal-
goorlie, are competing keenly. Boulder Club, as here
stated, made about £3OOO profit for the year ; an equal
amount is now to be put into a stand. The Kalgoorlie
Club, on receipts of £19,738 for three meetings, made
£4610 clear, besides spending £4752 on the course. All
prizes go up still higher for next season.
Framed receipt in Dan. O’Brien’s Criterion
hotel, New Plymouth (M.L.), sets forth that Messrs.
Hunter and Nolan received £651 “for the bay colt by
Musket from Mersey,” afterwards known as Carbine.
*‘* * *
Cabled information regarding betting and
“form” of Rock Sand pointed to him as the English
“ Darby ” winner. This is the second time Rock Sand’s
owner has scooped the same event—previous occasion
was 13 years ago, when Sainfoin won. Rock Sand has
already gathered a fortune, and, judging by engage-
ments ahead, looks like adding materially to the sum
piled up. Last year R.S. won £7474, and since has closed
on something in excess of £ll,OOO.
* * * *
Australian Trotting Association’s method of
probing apparently “ stiff ” running certainly has the
merit of originality, and would prove the right thing in
some instances. At recent meeting on Richmond (Vic.)
racecourse, stewards were doubtful about the genuine-
ness of favorite Honora’s shaping, whereupon they tried
her out themselves in company with two other nags—
one trotting and t’other galloping. Result, no action
taken.
* ♦ » *
Haut Star—winner of principal event at A.J.C.
meet Saturday—is the hag which won big race at Moore-
field Saturday before, and which, the owner complained an
hour or so previously' to handicapper Quinlan, was being
unreasonably heavily weighted. Getting away with the
two plums at two successive meetings isn’t by any means
a bad performance for an overburdened horse.
A. J.G. authorities have at last been galvanised
into life. The devious practices of jockeys and trainers
had become so aggressively 7 glaring that a blind man
could feel them. In last race at Moorefiela, Saturday
week, actions of one runner were noticed by hundreds
who thought, surely, the stipendiaries would get to work,
but they didn’t. However, last Saturday’s A.J.C. meet-
ing saw stewards of the day (not stipendiary) alert.
Graffnell’s showing in the hurdles caused his jockey’s (P.
Fallon) disqualification for 12 months; and trainer (M.
Thompson) and jockey (J. Brooks), connected with crack
mare Australia, who won Princess May Stakes, were
“sent up” for two years because of the nag’s inconsistent
displays. Two weeks before Australia finished fifth in
Tatt’s. Flying Handicap. Pity of all this is that rarely
are the right people punished. Trainers and jockeys
have to get their living, and consequently must do as
they are told.
* * * *
First of two days’ A.J.C. P. of W. Birthday
meet, Saturday, had bleak, showery weather, and punters
again beat Mo badly, every winner carrying a load of
coin—two were absolute first favorites, and other three
lined up only a “point” less in demand. Hurdles went
to VVootton’s Bizet after an interesting race all the way,
with Merry Jest and Jaques second and third. This is
perhaps the third time Jaques has been genuinely backed
and, though capable of doing better, he has invariably
disappointed his party. In Novice Handicap, one mile
(for nags that had not won a prize exceeding 50sovs. and
with apprentices up), only Highflyer and Lord Cardigan
were invested upon with any spirit, and they had the
finish to themselves. Kogarah-trained and owned High-
flyer triumphed “ on the post,” a head to the good.
Although promoting body 7 offered 200sovs. for First
Steeple, only four nags stripped and but two finished ;
which goes to prove how poor N.S.W. is in leppers.
Signet won handily, with Monarch second. Big run on
Australia—almost at “the death”—sent her out a hot
first choice for Princess May Stakes (6fur.), and she won
from 18 others, but only through jock, on Speculum 11.
being caught napping. Majority of the starters were
well backed. Ellesmere Stakes (ljm.) closed the pro-
gramme. Fireclay, Haut Star, Naphro, Canvee and
Dromedary found most support in a field of 15. Dis-
appointing Milner led till entering the straight and then
“chucked it” palpably. Down to the judge’s box Haut
Star and Circe were at high pressure, and former, lasting
longest, won half a neck best.
Adelaide Racing Club’s Birthday meeting
opened at Victoria Park, Saturday. Though weather
was fine, attendance didn’t reach expectations. Tote
investments (£11,575) showed a falling off of £2OOO com-
pared with same day last year. Remarkable jumping
success (Corral) of recent S.A.J.C. meet fell and Sarasati
won, beating favorite (Cynig) easily. City Handicap
went to Stuart King, who, as a yearling, was bought for
60gs. and subsequently won Fulham Park Plate —first
2yr. old race of the season. Present owner (Mr. C. Smith)
paid 300g8. for Stuart King, who is a gelding. Emilene
secured the Steeple (about 2m.), without being fully ex-
tended, in fast time of 3min. 59Jsec. Carlyon-Lady Noris
nag St. Vincent and Aurate disputed favoritism till
eleventh hour (when weight of money sent latter out
most in demand) for Adelaide Stakes (7fur.), and they ran
first and second as mentioned. Issue was never in doubt.
St. Vincent got home easily and with something in hand.
Winner humped the steadier of 9.10 ; he is full brother to
Trowbridge, among the best of last year’s early per-
formers. Royal Artillery and Bombastes are half-brothers
of St. Vincent. Heavily supported Ballarat-prepared filly
Sweet Nell, of whom much was expected, went under to
outsider Combat in Park side Stakes (lm. lfur.) by half a
length. Combat paid £l3 10s., which indicates how poor
his prospects were considered.

Cross-country rider B. Whalley sustained a
dual fracture of the left arm through Isis’ fall on
Saturday ; this after an enforced spell from the game
since September last, when Monarch’s cropper in the
first steeple of A. J.C. Spring meet caused the breaking of
an arm.
* * ♦ *
Bot fly brought about the death of trotting
stallion Globe (Huon—Lucilla), at Forbes (N.S.W.)
t’other day. Among his get were Globe Junior, Victor,
Singer, The Gift, Globette, Olaf, etc. Owners refused
£4OO for Globe a little time before they lost him.
* * * •
Crack little cross-country nag Frantic 11. had
his last jump in Steeple at Randwick, Saturday, when,
through misjudging take off, he struck both stifles on
logs opposite judge’s box and came a heavy cropper,
sliding yards on his shoulders. Subsequent investigation
disclosed a shattered stifle and fractured spine, which
necessitated his destruction. Latest owner (Mr. W.
Anderson) only got Frantic recently, and since then he
won S.T.C. ’Chase. Said that £250 was, a day or two ago,
refused for the nag. Rider (Burtenshaw) had his collar-
bone broken. Same event was responsible for another
casualty. Two jumps further than that which brought
Frantic down saw Isis (after lepping doubtfully so far)
turn a complete somersault.

“ Tot ” Glasscock, of Kirk’s Bazaar, Melbourne,
died last week. Years ago, “Tot” was one of the best
of professional-amateur steeplechase jockeys, and it was
then that he acquired the beginnings of the lung com-
plaint which carried him off at 42.
Q.T.C. meet ended Saturday. Tas.-owned and
Sydney-trained Ivan won Moreton Handicap (lim.)
Among 19 starters were Contest, Bridegroom, Ilderim,
Amber and Heronry. Atop of two previous successes at
the meeting Grafton-Olive Branch colt, Fitz-Grafton,
proved too much for the opposition in the Royal Stakes
(Im.) which included Balfour, Whitebait, Purser and
Bridegroom. Prior wins were Stradbroke Handicap and
Claret Stakes.

Dear Bulletin.— Re current spieler argument.
There are two seats —one in Hyde Park and one in Outer
Domain —known amongst domainiacs as the “ Spielers’
Rests.” To avoid being seen together in the streets,
every morning a number of well-known spielers, mags-
men, confidence-men and decoys assemble there to
confer and draw plans and specifications for their day’s
work. Judging by their appearance, the Sydney spielers
are a poor, ragged, filthy 7, dissipated-looking lot, who
exhibit little outward financial signs of “two-up” or
skill of any kind. They seem to be starving more than
living on the “game.” Meanness and cowardice are
written on every' line of their vile faces. How they can
gain the confidence of anyone is past this writer’s com-
prehension. Yet to hear them brag, one would think
they could show points to Dante the Great and Oinque-
valli in the now-you-see-it-now-you-don’t line. If their
professional brothers out-back can’t show better results
for their alleged skill and cleverness—well, spieling isn’t
the game it’s cracked up to be, and little better than
bar-lunch snatching.— The Domainiac.

“ Battler ” : Some wild men from Melbourne
have started a Maoriland Association of Australian Foot-
ball at Christchurch. A peaceful park nearly became a
crimson battle-field when the new ball-bouncers had
their opening practice. They casually' stole the ground
of a party of shin-padded, chest-protected, long-nailed
Rugbyites, and seemed surprised when these latter
bruisers came on the scene, gritting their teeth and pre-
paring to rend the trespassers asunder. The Mel-
bournians left. They' have since invited the natives to
join the pacific association, but there’s not enbugh blood
and skin flying in the new game to tempt the fierce and
gore-spattered youth of M.L.
* *
The proposed M.L. Rugby football team for
England hasn’t got over the expenses portion of the tour
yet. There’s a deal of opposition to the idea, and the
Imperialism of Seddon doesn’t enter into sport ;
keener interest is manifested in the premiership
contests than the English tour. Still a team (and a
good one, too) could be raised if only some kind of a
guarantee could be obtained. Last year some supporters
of the game promised over £2OOO towards expenses ; but
somehow none of them left his address, and this modesty
is the real cause of the deadlock.
* * *
Sydney Evening News the other day published,
as a joke, a mock-serious account of a brutal football
match. It was obviously intended to satirise Sydney
D.T.’s silly descriptions of boxing matches. But the
paper joked with such difficulty that the article was
taken seriously, and the office was invaded by' a host of
footballers, barrackers, and other influential personages
demanding the writer’s scalp. The News, therefore,
apologised at great length, and explained that its report
was intended in a purely' jocular spirit, and that it never
dreamt of giving offence, etc. But the News hasn’t yet
apologised for its yarns about strike outrages, nor has
the D.T. for its more frenzied fictions on the subject. An
honest worker struggling for his rights may be insulted
with impunity in Australia, but not a footballer.

Fitzroy (Yic.) - N.S.W. toeball match (Aus-
tralian rules) on Sydney Cricket Ground, in bleak
weather and rain showers, last week, proved heaps more
interesting than did much bigger Fitzroy v. Collingwood
struggle on same ground previous Saturday for Victorian
premiership. This was because onlooking 2000 could enter
into the rivalry 7, and also through N.S.W. making a far
better showing than was anticipated by the most
sanguine. At one period N.S.W. had 7 goals to
Fitzrov’s 6, and the crowd ’thused accordingly, but this
scribe’s view was that Fitzroys didn’t reach out over
much—they looked to be aiming at supply ing an attrac-
tive show more than an exhibition of what could be done
with the opposing team. All the same, however,
N.S.W.’s shaping impressed very much, considering Aus-
tralian rules have only been revived in Sy'dney a couple
of months. Three-quarters time saw less than a goal
difference between the combinations, but ultimately
match finished Fitzroy 8 goals 22 behinds (70 points),
N.S.W. 7 goals 5 behinds (47 points).

The growth of “Empire.” The much-coveted
first century ” in English cricket falls this season to
B. Jaya Ram, a Madras “colored pusson,” in a fixture
London County v. Eighteen of Sydenham. Slowly the
dark blot grows on England’s athletic world, and an
English cricket team in future must assuredly find p'aoes
for a few Hindus, at any rate. Last season W. G. Grace
scooped the honor, but in this match he notched 40 runs ;
and erstwhile Australian Poidevin scored a similar quota.

Broken Hill—where demon trundler Jones
hailed from—unearthed about the best country batsman
for the year. Clem Wellington (or, as he is known on
the Barrier Ranges, “the Barrier Trumper”) smashed
all records held in that district in very short time, and
closed the season with an average of 157"5 per innings,
the highest score being 238 not out. When it is noted
that the performances were put up on slate and concrete
wickets, with scarcely a blade of grass on the awfully
uneven playing area, the brilliance of the batting
becomes more apparent.

Adelaide being the strongest lacrosse centre in
Australia, and the University the backbone of the game
in Adelaide, something of a sensation has been caused
by the defeat of the students—9 to o—by0—by Sturt, a nearly
new club. N.S.W. and Victoria both play on the Ade-
laide Oval at the end of June. As a sign of the game’s

“Ye olde Englyshe game of bowls ” has been
making rapid strides lately in Brisbane, and an asso-
ciation is being formed, having for its principal
object the selection of teams to do battle with those of
the southern States, and the arranging of such contests.
Three rinks from Maryborough, composed largely of
veteran play'ers, visited Brisbane at the end of May, and
defeated Booroodabin Club by 8 points, but were defeated
by the South Brisbane Bowling Club (a new club whose
green was only opened in December last) by 10 points.
The victory 7 of the S.B. B. Club w'as an unexpected event,
and deserving of every praise. The Maryborough men
w'ere at a slight disadvantage in the game against 5.8.,
as regards the green, which W'as very keen, and totally
different in its play from that of the Booroodabin Club,
on w'hich the visitors had previously played. One of the
games played between Maryborough and S.B. was remark-
able for the small number of points scored—a game of 21
heads resulting in a total of only 28 points—l 2 to Mary-
borough and 16 to S.B.

“ Ike : Stated in B. (23/5/’O3) that the short
rowing boat has come to stay on the strength
of the fact that all scullers now 7 use ’em. Accord-
ing to recent trials in Melbourne, it will be a
long time before eights and fours of the Neilson
type will be universally used in Australia. Time tests
and observation of experienced oarsmen, to say nothing
of ignominious position of both short boats in recent
inter - State contest, have decided strongly against
them. The idea of the designer is that ’ the boat
travels faster over the top of the water than through
it. All very well as long as the boat stays on
top, but whereas in sculling the peculiar ‘ slide-first ’
style does not bury the nose of the boat, and it is
possible to keep ‘ punching her ’ along the top of the
water, in rowing the direct weight of bodies over the
slides and the swing of the 8 bodies together buries both
nose and stern of the boat, unless provided for by
greater support fore and aft in the water, which short
boats cannot give without undue width and consequent
resistance.
World’s sculling champion Geo. Towns hasn t,
so far, responded to Dick Tressider’s challenge beyond
pleading that domestic and business exactions preclude
the possibility' of training y r et awhile ; also the getting of
the side bet is a difficulty not easily surmounted. Hinted
(only) that the “top sawyer” of them all may name a
date in coming Spring. Probably there’ll be no race in-
side six months and possibly none at all ; yet ’twas
authoritatively stated that if Tressider beat Pearce,
Towns would be on hand immediately to make a match.
Not a few ascribe Towns’ hesitancy to knowledge of what
he could do with Pearce compared with what he saw
Tressider do opposed to the same man.

“ Old Timer ” : The Clarence (N.S.W.) is again
to the fore with a rower (J. Philp) who wants to meet
Tressider in heavy boats for £lOO aside. Mick Rush —a
great man in the seventies and physically superior to most
we have had in same line, learned his sculling as he rowed
a butcher’s boat about that same river. “Pros” Coulon,
who promised to surprise the world but died (ay’oung man)
of swamp fever nearly 30 years ago, lived on the Clarence.
Donald M’Donald, Elias Laycock (who scooped the big
Hop Bitters prize in England) and Harry Searle all hailed
from the same locality.

Our old friend, Professor Miller, the champion
athlete with the splay feet and inelegant figure, is off to
England, intending to end his days there. It seems a
mistake for this native Australian and representative
muscular citizen of Melbourne to seek an uncomfortable
change of climate in a country where he hasn’t any
records —but he’s off, any'how. Lord Mayor Gillott,
Purves, K. 0., and a mob of old admirers gave the
swarthy Prof, a smoke-night. They talked of the times
when he wrestled Donald Dinnie and Clarence Whistler,
the American inventor of the “ hammerlock,” who cele-
brated his victory over the Australian champion by T
chewing champagne glasses. The Bulletin will always
remember Miller by Hop.’s illustrations of a wrestling
match in Sydney between the huge Professor and the
comparatively small Mons. Victor. The terms of the con-
tract required Miller to throw Victor ten times, or more,
in an hour, which he duly did. Hop.’s pictures were
drawn from the point of view of a sympathetic artist, who
didn’t doubt that Victor would get thrown, but was
wondering where the big man would throw him to.

Second meeting of Sydney Kensington Coursing
Club, last week, proved more of an inter-State character
than many Australian Water'oo Cups. Big event (Ken-
sington Stakes) fell to Victorian owned and trained The
Hermit, who never gave whilom N.S.W. champion,
Braddon’s Blot, a hope. The Hermit shaped promisingly
all through last season in Victoria, and this year—though
beaten by Royal Fusileer at opening meeting of Kensing-
ton C.C. —met same hound again in latest event and
turned the tables completely. In Orange Cup, a few
weeks ago, The Hermit won three courses, and then
succumbed to the brilliant Rooty Hill performer, Great
Heart, in an exciting tussle. Runner-up (Braddon’s
Blot) had a narrow squeak with winner’s kennel-mate,
w r ho stumbled at a critical moment. Orange-owmed
puppy Cannongate made his first appearance in public
and secured Puppy event (meeting Victorian bitch, Nar-
row Escape, in the decider) so cleverly' that he should be
worth watching. Similarly owmed Lavender won the
Novice Stakes well. Feature of second day’s proceedings
was the large number of heavily-backed dogs that went
down. No less than seven of eight favorites, in first
round of Novice event, were beaten.
* * * *
Kensington Coursing Club has adopted Ameri-
can idea of weighing dogs before each course. Until con-
tending hounds are placed in charge of a responsible
official in kennels at the slips—say an hour before w'anted
to run—weighing the dogs is the only possible check on
crooked work, as by' this means the big “ feed ” or drink
necessary to hamper a hound’s movements can be easily
detected. On first day (Thursday 7) The Hermit, prior to
his initial run, scaled 62£lbs. and later in day weighed
exactly the same. Friday saw him open up 631b5., and,
though running twice subsequently, he never varied an
oz. Cannongate, before each of his three wins on Friday,
pulled the beam at 65£, 65J, and 651bs.

Probably the shortest fight held under modern
conditions in Australia took place on Saturday night in
the Queen’s Hall, Melb., when Dick Kernick knocked out
heavyweight Joe Cullen in one round. The fight didn’t
last the full 180 seconds by' a long way. The men had
hardly come together before Kernick punched Cullen
twice quickly with his left, and disconcerting him with
these, shot in a heavy right that took his point
and finished him. The actual fighting apparently did
not exceed ten seconds, and certainly the time occupied
by the counting out of Cullen seemed longer than the
period of combat. Kernick is a big powerful fellow, 6ft.
high, and well proportioned. A few years ago he made
his first appearance in the ring, when he made a clever
showing. His aversion to punishment W'as said to be
responsible for his lack of success then.

“Soldier” Jack Thompson and Arthur Cripps
(holder of the title) are matched to fight again, July 14,
for middle-weight supremacy of the continent. Thomp-
son has little chance of turning the tables, except by a
fluke, which is unlikely with a cool, methodical boxer
like Cripps. When Thompson challenged, he expressed
readiness to find any side-wager Cripps might be pre-
pared to cover, but the time to put money up found
Thompson without even a “ fiver ” to bet, hence ’tis
strange that the second match was made. It will, how-
ever, prove exciting, and there’ll probably be many who’ll
give Thompson a “good chance” of retrieving lost
credentials.

M.L. Boxing Association has intimated that
its team for Australasian amateur championships in
Sy'dney during September will be made up of premiers in
feather, light, middle, and heavy divisions, and probably
a bantam rep. may be sent along. Victoria and Queens-
land will also send champions, consequently the gathering
promises to prove ahead of anything the continent has
yet known in amateur boxing. At M.L. Association’s
annual meeting last month it was told that branches had
been established at Wei ington and Wanganui and were
being formed at Auckland. Nelson, and Dunedin. First
competitions for local championships were exceptionally
successful and realised £lO4 clear profit.
Match ’tween Jim Higgins and Bob Fraser,
t other day 7, for middle-weight supremacy of Victoria saw
previous holder (Fraser) beaten convincingly, though
when the same couple met before he won on points.
Higgins was slow, and Fraser opened up with such speed
and effeot that odds of 2to 1 were laid on him Fra*,
used a heavy right, but Higgins merely shook his S
and kept administering heavy body punishment narti™
larly over the kidneys. It proved an even thin® from
the fifth to the ninth, when successive thumps
dazed Fraser and he was very much second-best «uh« 7
quently though his showing was plucky enough Th.
13th round brought the end. Three times Fraser bumnert
the boards hard, and on the third occasion he
prone—done completely. u

The details in connection with the DunW
Inter-Club Road Premiership, run under the auspices
the N.S.W. Cyclists’ Union, comprise a very comS®
sive series of scratch racing for the winter season Thr
courses have been decided on : the usual road race on
from Homebush to Granville and back twice distant
about 20 miles ; from foot of Gore Hill, North Svdnev t
Pymble Railway Gates and back twice, distance ahn.u
22J miles ; and a course starting from near the toll bar
Randwick Road going towards La Perouse and taking in .
circuit with Long Bay and Maroubra, distance about m
miles. An entry from all the Metropolitan Clubs il
anticipated and the keenest enthusiasm is being shewn
as not only does the competition carry with it the title of
Road Premiers for the year, but also the holding of the
Dunlop shield and gold medals for individual riders in the
teams. At the conclusion of the team championship an
additional race will be run for the individual road
championship of the year—the winner carrying the title
of Road Champion and also championship medal worth
£5 55., presented by Dunlop Tyre Company. Amateur
circles are now alive with men in active training and the
promotion of a competition of this nature bids fair to
create that healthy rivalry which is so necessary towards
the promotion of road sport.*

People who take an interest in cycle matters
will learn with regret that the Dunlop Tyre Co. has had a
dispute with the League of N.S.W. Wheelmen, which has
Caused the company to abandon this year its now famous
road race from Goulburn to Sydney. Whenever the
matter of money is introduced into a sport, a great propor-
tion of the public begin to look upon that sport with a
sinister eye, and to cast aspersions on the reliability of
time-tests and records. The first question is “Was the
record bought or how was it obtained?” It is on this
point that the dispute has arisen, and the strangest part
of the business is that the League, which is avowedly
organised for the purpose of maintaining the honor
of the sport, has sought to coerce the Dunlop
Tyre Co. into paying a substantial sum to the
referee, timekeepers, starters, and other Leivue
officials who attended the attempts of F. °S
Beauchamp to lower records. The company refused
to pay anything but nominal fees, on the ground that the
League officials should act in an honorary capacity where
their services are employed in connection with records
The League met the co.’s refusal to pay a sub-
stantial sum by refusing to grant sanction for the
proposed Dunlop road race unless the co. first paid the
“records” money. The co. thereupon stated its
ultimatum in these words: “We must, however,
impress upon you (the League of Wheelmen) that we
positively decline to pay your officials one single farthing,
and consider that, acting as they are supposed to do in an
honorary capacity, they should neither ask for nor accept
any payment."

before they are eligible to compete. Cyclists can obtain
the necessary affiliation forms from Mr. T. Heide, Secre-

The Bulletin has received a tiny and tasteful
booklet, describing a visit to the famous South Australian
vineyards of Penfold and Co. (started in 1844 by the late
Dr. Penfold, with the view of producing a first-class wine

upon a gigantic scale, views of the vineyards are given,
and the celebrated cellars are fully described and illus-

Kodak Kodoid Plates are the latest novelty
introduced by Kodak Limited, 284 Collins street, Mel-
bourne. Claimed for these new flat films that, while
lighter, thinner, and safer than glass plates, they are
nearly 20 per cent, cheaper than any other cut films.
They are also very rapid, with a very fine-grained emul-
sion. The K.K.P. consist of a light, unbreakable film
which is attached at the edges by clips to a card support,
and they are so devised that they can be used in
ordinary plate holders or sheaths wherever glass plates
can be used, and in exactly the same way. They are
much thinner than the average cut film, and can there-
fore be printed from either side, and they do not curl in
drying.*

About the Suttors :
The original George Sutter —as then spelled—came out
in the year 1800 in the ship Porpoise. He was the son of
a farmer and gardener, renting land from Lord Cadogan,
at the place now known as Chelsea. He brought with him
certain plants and a promise of a land grant. He took
part with Governor Bligh, and suffered six months
imprisonment for his loyalty. He went home as a
witness for Bligh at the trial of Colonel Johnson. He
built a house in Sydney at a cost of £2OOO, where it is
said that Allan Cunningham lived with him, and
Leichhardt was a frequent visitor. In 1814 he
was appointed superintendent of the lunatic asylum at
Castle Hill, but did not retain the position long.
Mr. Suttor is known in Australian history as
the first professional gardener to arrive in the colony.
In 1843 he published a volume on “The Cultivation of
the Vine and Olive in Australia.” His third son, William
Henry Suttor, father of the present Suttors, William
Henry and F. 8., married a Miss Frances and went over
the Blue Mountains at the age of 16. For years the
Suttors considered Bathurst their pocket borough.
Old William Henry Suttor, senior, was privileged
to read his own obituary notice—he was reported
as dead, and S.M. Herald came out with a column.
Alloway Bank, his home on the Macquarie, was inundated
with letters and telegrams (with mileage added) of sym-
pathy and condolence. Mr. Suttor spent £lO in answer-
ing these communications, sent in his bill to the Herald
and promptly got a cheque for the amount.

Re that much-talked-about economy by
the cutting down of the Vic. train service. No
sooner was the secret settlement arrived at than
various keen supporters of the Iceberg Govern-
ment began laying siege to Commissioner Fitz-
patrick for a resumption of the services to their
districts on the old basis, and pulling the strings
through their friends in the Ministry. What a
glorious opportunity presents itself for the lee-
bergers to work the “spoils to the victors
dodge ! The districts which return Bent’s sup-
porters will soon be getting their trains as usual,
but the ones which refuse to vote the Kyabram
ticket will probably get a mighty poor service for
many a day, unless they think better of it and
start approving of the Irvine-Bent with great
enthusiasm.
Apropos of George Reid’s recent assur-
ances that, if he becomes Federal Premier, he
won’t dream of imposing direct taxation, this is a
clause from the published programme of the
“Freetrade Association,” under whose auspices
Reid rushed into the Federal fray :
That the first Federal tariff should, as far as the exi-
gencies of the several States will permit, embrace a
number of duties somewhat similar to those in Great
Britain, with the intention of as soon as possible estab-
lishing a free breakfast table, any deficiency of revenue
in such latter case to be made up by direct taxation.
The mighty Wobbler was elected on a policy of
Federal direct taxation, and sits for a seat which
he won on that policy, though he is against that
policy now —at least, he is against it in Protec-
tionist Tasmania and for it in Freetrade Sydney,
and in other places he totters indistinctly on one
leg.
Item from Sydney Telegraph :
Over a very wide number of articles it may be said that
whether duties are 12J per cent, or 25 percent. makes
very little difference to the Treasury, on the principle
that, roughly, half the goods will be imported at the
higher rate which would be imported at the lower one.
It takes some time for local manufacturers to supply the
deficiencies caused by restricted imports, but they do so
eventually, and it is then that a highly protective tariff
becomes unproductive.
Again the beautiful Freetrade doctrine? Let us
keep down local manufactures and local employ-
ment and wages and skill, so that we may buy lots
of things from the foreigner, and then by taxing
ourselves on these things (in addition to paying
the foreigner for them), and paying ourselves the
said taxes, we may have money in the Treasury.

In the Sydney Domain, recently, a perfect
lady—garbed in a green satin bodice, a gashed
and tattered skirt, and a quaint hat —strode along
a path looking for fight. Met another lady, and
straightway accused her of stealing her silk stock-
ings, worth 10s., and, with hoots of defiance,
challenged her to hit out. While she was
skipping about the road and chopping the
air in an impressive way, the accused was
informing the audience that Madam Trollop was
a “butter stranger,’’ and that, though she was
herself a peaceable character, yet if she had two
beers she could flatten her accuser out. She
insinuated that if she had three beers she could
slay Madam Trollop with one blow. There was
a half-hour of angry speech with frequent calls
for the two beers, when a swamped-looking
mariner lurched up and investigated the case.
After hearing particulars he informed the
aspersed party that her honor was involved,
and that she must smite Madam Trollop in order
to clear her character. Thereupon, just when the
assailant lady least expected it, she received a
mighty biff on the lower part of the bodice, and
immediately dispersed and fled into the fast-
nesses of Woolloomooloo. Then the seaman told
the onlookers that it was a scandal, and lurched
on.

HAVE YOU
A BAD LEE
with Wound! that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the Joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
Hallowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN
CURE YOU. I don't say perhaps j but I WILL. Because
others have failed is no reason for not how being cured.

Dear Sirs: Our little boy was deli-
cate from birth, and seemed to derive
no benefit from any food we gave him, gradu-
ally becoming thinner and weaker. He took
whooping-cough and sunk so low that wo
thought he was gone. We tried several things
without succeeding in reviving him, and were
then advised to try Scott’s Emulsion, which
we did without hope. From the first dose it
agreed with him ; he was able to keep it on his
stomach. He rapidly gained in health and
strength, and we soon saw life and movement
in his frame, which before had been quite
emaciated and listless. He cut his teeth abso-
lutely without trouble, and now at the age of
sixteen months has them all, and is a fine,
hearty little chap. Scott’s Emulsion, without
doubt, saved his life. Faithfully yours,
(Signed) Mrs. Margaret Watson.
Mr. Henry Watson.

DO THREATENED CHILDREN
LIVE? Some do for a long time, so
tenacious are they of life. If they have not
strength it makes the fight difficult. There
is an easy way of prolonging their life, by
giving Scott’s Emulsion. Two who have seen
the cure performed have just proved that to
you above. Be careful with delicate children.
The great care that you want to take should
be in the direction of getting them stronger
quickly. It is not necessary to point out how
difficult it is to rear a delicate child, or how
liable that child is to succumb to disease.
The thing that you want us to point out is
how to cure the trouble. The remedy is
SCOTT'S EMULSION, the „<*
important factor of child-life. All that
mother and father wish to know is that, if
the child is delicate, the dangers following
on delicate condition can be prevented or
removed by Scott’s Emulsion: which acts
promptly, surely, steadily, until the cure is
complete. It has saved delicate children of
every nationality under the sun, and it will
save delicate Australians.
You have one precaution only to take; and
that is to see that on the wrapper of the
bottle there is a picture of a man carrying
a big cod-fish ; if that cod-fish is not there,
you are not getting what we promise you
—a cure! You can obtain a sample of
Scott’s Emulsion and the choicest children’s
booklet of the year, “A Bunch of Roses,”
beautifully printed in colours, by sending
sd. to Scott & Bowne, Ltd., 483 Kent-street,
Sydney, and mentioning this paper. All
chemists sell Scott’s Emulsion.
ALMOST
EVERY HUMAN ACHE
Is RHEUMATIC in its origin.
Rheumatism is caused by Uric Acid Poisoning.
Gout is caused by Uric Acid Poisoning.
Neuralgia is caused by Uric Acid Poisoning.
Lumbago is caused by Uric Acid Poisoning.
Sciatica is caused by Uric Acid Poisoning.
Blood Disorders are caused by Uric Acid Poisoning.
Gravel is caused by Uric Acid Poisoning.
Stone is caused by Uric Acid Poisoning.
Bladder Troubles are caused by Uric Aoid Poisoning.
WHAT IS URIC ACID ?
Uric Acid is one of the many products of the wasting of the body. Every moment we live the
body is wasting, and it is the duty of certain of our organs to remove the waste matter.
THE KIDNEYS.
To the kidneys is allotted a large portion of this task. The kidneys of the average person
and extract from the blood about three pints of urine every day. In this quantity of urine should be
dissolved about an ounce of urea, ten to twelve grains, in weight, of uric acid, together with other
animal and mineral matter varying from a third of an ounce to nearly an ounce. If the kidneys from
any cause are unable to do their work properly, some of these substances remain in the system, and
become actively poisonous. Uric acid is the most dangerous of these poisons. When it is deposited
in the joints and tissues, it produces Rheumatism, Lumbago, Sciatica or Gout. In other
cases the blood, being contaminated, is rendered unfit to absorb nutriment freely, and we suffer from
Anaemia, Neuralgia, Digestive Troubles, Blood Disorders, and Debility, Sometimes
the uric acid is deposited in the kidneys themselves, and then the frightful pain caused by Stone,
Gravel, and Bladder Troubles is experienced.
Thousands have kidney disorders, and suffer from uric acid poisoning, without knowing the
cause. The most common indication that there is anything wrong with the kidneys is
PAIN IN THE BACK.
A more certain test to make is, to place some urine, passed the first thing in the morning, in a
covered glass, and let it stand until the next morning, If it is then cloudy, shows a brick-dust like
sediment, if particles float about in it, or it is of an unnatural colour, then the kidneys are not
healthy, and no time should be lost in ensuring their restoration, or Bright’s Disease, Diabetes
or some less serious but more painful illness will be the result.
Warner’s Safe Cure.
About thirty years ago, Medical and Scientific men, realising the importance of the efficient
removal of uric acid, and other waste poisons from the system, made special research with the view
to discover a remedial agent. They realised the fact that it was necessary to discover a medicine
which would act specifically upon both the liver and the kidneys, as, when the kidneys are affected,
the liver suffers in sympathy, and vice versa. The outcome of their research was the medicine now
known throughout the world as Warner’s Safe Cure. This medicine possesses the desired property in
the fullest degree, and though over a quarter of a century has passed since it was first discovered, no
remedy has yet been developed of like power. It acts equally upon the kidney and liver, restoring
them to health and activity, when all urinary and biliary poisons are of necessity removed from the
system in a natural manner. Warner’s Safe Cure consequently cures Rheumatism, Gout, Back-
ache, Lumbago, Sciatica, Persistent Headache, Neuralgia, Gravel, Stone and Bladder
Troubles, Ansemia, Debility, Indigestion, Torpid Liver. Even Bright’s Disease yields
to treatment by Warner’s Safe Cure.
Mr. J. T. Castner, of 8 Victoria-street, Paddington, N.S.W., says : “Some time ago I was under
medical treatment for severe pains in the back. The doctor who attended me wanted me to undergo
the operation of crushing a stone in my bladder, but I did not like the idea, although the pain I
was suffering was severe. A friend advised me to try Warner’s Safe. Cure. I did, and, after taking
three or four bottles, I began to feel better. I continued the course, and, thanks to this medicine, I
became free from any trouble whatever.”
A treatise containing particulars relating to Warner’s Safe Cure, and the diseases it cures' will be
sent free by H. H. Warner and Co., Limited, Australasian Branch, Melbourne, Vic.

iliere is a universal howl among Fatmen
at Tom Mann being paid £6OO a year “as an
agitator. Doesn’t the Employers’ Federation
nre an agitator named Walpole, and hasn’t the
Dean t ? rm league a stipendiary agitator named
From some accounts, if the British
Government persists in its encouragement of the
importation of Asiatic coolies to the Rand mines,
there will be a white insurrection there. Jew-
hannesburg Tribune so prophesies, straightly and
N.S.W.’s first notable deficit was the
4 ortaf?e Cowper and Robertson in
lobo. Roth contended there was no deficit, but
the evidence was too strong for them. On the
strength of theexposure Martin and Foster headed
a new retrenchment Government, which promptly
produced a £200,000 shortage to begin with.
Victorian Parliamentary Committee on
railways, in its current report, condemns the
ingenious swindle by which the State Govern-
ments pay the duty on imported steel rails
with borrowed money, and then draw back from
*“ e Federal. Government three-fourths or more of
the duty paid (with borrowed money) and treat it
as revenue.
N.S.W. Treasurer Waddell forecasts for
the next session a Closer Settlement Bill, which
will burst up the big estates.” But its system
of purchase might also “burst up” the Treasury.
Why should not the State, as a preliminary,
resume some of the unearned increment by a pro-
gressive land tax ? The proceeds might be set
aside for repurchase of estates, by way of has-
tening the bursting up.
Rochester (Vic.) tries to run its municipal
business on a sixpenny rate; naturally typhoid
fever is rampant.. Typhoid in Australia is mostly
due to low municipal taxation in country centres.
There has, so far, been devised no means by which
a municipality can throw the work of garbage
collecting on the State Government, and what
the average country crowd can’t cadge on the
Government for, it neglects.
N.S.W. Government is said to be con-
sidering appointments to the Upper House.
There have been several deaths of Councillors
lately, and the Government is in a marked
minority just now. Any taxation proposals that
the necessity of doing without borrowed money
might call for would not have a chance in the
Upper House as now constituted. Possibly Pre-
mier See is thinking of doing without borrowed
money—though he doesn’t look like it.
Let it be pointed out, robustly and insist-
ently, that any sort of a Compulsory Arbitration
Act, such as that of Maoriland or N.S. Wales,
would have absolutely prevented the Victorian
railway strike with all its rage and hysteria. Any
union which ignored the Arbitration Court or
disobeyed its decisions could be struck by almost
illimitable damages. But the blind Victorian
Ministry has always been against such a peaceful
method of settling disputes—and on it lies the
responsibility of the trouble.
When Kingston, with a very moderate
Parliamentary majority behind him, and the
hostility of almost the whole city press and all the
forces of wealth and social influence to face,
enforced the law honestly against the swindling
importers of Australia, nothing was said about
his courage ; according to the press he was only a
pig-headed tyrant. And when Irvine, with a big
majority of the Assembly, all the Upper House,
almost all the papers, all the rich men of the
State, and all the landlord interest behind him,
put his hoof down on a cause that was already
lost, according to the same press his courage was
something enormous.
When the last Commonwealth elections
were on, Australia had not awakened to the fact
that it was possible to have as democratic a Senate
as House of Representatives, and the consequence
was that quite a number of dreary old dodderers
got into the Senate who would have had no possible
hope of getting into the Reps. The average Aus-
tralian was so accustomed to see the State Upper
Houses crowded with fossilised imbeciles and fat-
brained men whose sole qualification was the
possession of much cash, that they allowed some
perfectly avoidable evils to infest the Senate.
There is hope, however, that the ghastly mistake
won’t be repeated.
Judas Chamberlain, in October, 1899,
when stirring up feeling against the Boers with a
view to war and annexation :
The treatment of the natives of the Transvaal has been
disgraceful. It has been brutal. It has been unworthy
of a civilised Power.
Judas Iscariot Chamberlain (March, 1903), when
the Transvaal steal was finished, cynically ex-
plaining what a liar he had been :
The majority of the House were led to believe that the
treatment of the natives by the Boers was very bad . . .
these charges were exaggerated . . . the Boers must be
absolved from the charge of ill-treatment.
Sydney Sunday Retired Grocer is crying
for the suppression of “ agitators ” and points
admiringly to the expulsion of Tom Mann from
Belgium as a bright and shining example of
what ought to be done in Australia. This
suggestion is based on the fact that at present Mr.
Mann is “ going about the country sowing further
seeds of discord at public meetings and elsewhere,
and helping to keep the cauldron of ill-feeling on
the boil.” The Bulletin, for one, wouldn’t
mind so very much if Tom Mann were expelled,
likewise a dozen other agitators. The cause
would still go on, and the precedent would be
most valuable some day when the other crowd
wanted to expel the Freetrade agitator M'Millan,
the private railway agitator, the anti-land-tax and
anti-income-tax agitator, the Yellow Pup agitator,
the Kyabram agitator, and many others. A
precedent is sometimes a handy thing to have
about the house.
Kiwi writes :
It requires no great perceptive power to recognise in
an alleged Maoriland Farmers’ Union the old National
Ass with a new cover on. Seddon’s declaration that he
will next session introduce legislation to give preference
to Unionists has called forth a loud bray of dissent from
the bucolic animal, and it is also beginning to busy itself
about the land question. At a picnic held recently in
Rangitikei, under the auspices of the Union, one orator,
appropriately named Vile, launched out about the free-
hold being the inheritance of every Briton. The crowd
of busy bushwhackers cheered, as if the great mass of
Britons ever owned a piece of land until they got under-
neath the surface ! Another speaker, a real live capting,
implored the farmers to trust the Lord and fight for the
freehold. Which recalls the pious Cornishman who
prayed for a shipwreck before morning. Of course,
Trades Unionists get no quarter from these gentry. In
fact, my experience is that the average cocky has about
the same hatred for the non-landowning class as the
most purse-proud squatter. In a few years Maoriland
politics will degenerate into a fight between Unionism
and cockyism, and between the two Fatman will feel
more comfortable than he has for some time. Faction
has ever been a godsend to Reaction.

The decision of the North Mount Lyell Co.
(Tas.) to finally close down its smelters on May 30 has
made things serious for the dependent town of Crotty.
Crotty is composed almost entirely of North Lyell
workers and the attendant storekeepers, &c., and this
closing of the works means practically the removal of
everybody and the shutting up of everything.

Island Eureka, Lake Austin (W.A.), in spite of
protestations that the mine was all right when it was
here stated that it was played out, has suspended divs.
for four months, while the last two crushings read 1260 z.
from 240 tons, and 2040 z. from 200 tons. Yet the direc-
tors were repeatedly assured that, from ore in sight,
*soooz. monthly from 25dwt. stone could be maintained
for the next three years. In June last year shareholders
were also told that the main shaft was to be sunk another
200 ft., and another 10-head of stamps, with a cyanide
plant, were to be purchased out of profits. A year has
passed and the promise is still unfulfilled. It is a signifi-
cant fact that the three local directors—Bates, Brook-
man_, and White —resigned in favor of Adelaide men ; and
it is more significant still that the adjoining
Golconda, which was working the same lode at
a deeper level, has decided, on the advice of
manager A. B. Martin, to abandon the property.
Since 1894 the Golconda has spent £57,250 of Buli’s
money, besides £53,000 from gold won, or £110,250, and
the only return in divs. has been £6750. Martin w'as in
charge of the Golconda before the Eureka was publicly
heard of, so should know the ground well. Eureka may
come again, if anything fresh is found, but, at present,
prospects are far from rosy.

Mulwaree East (W. A.), a second reconstruction
of Menzies, Ltd., re-floated, in Aug., 1900, to take over
the deep levels of big John de Baun’s rich show at Mt.
Higgins, has gone to pieces, and the plant is offered for
sale. Three years ago the property was regarded as
first-rate, but the lode, which near the surface was very
Hat, has apparently straightened up at depth.

Queensland Menzies (W.A.) is being gradually
appreciated by investors. Co. is now paying monthly
divs. of 6d., and, although this distribution cannot be
absolutely assured, the mine is in such a good position
that a long term of profitable working is in sight.
Manager Ferguson has had a stiff row to hoe, but appears
to be on the road to success.

Before returns from South Kalgurli (W.A. can

Queen Margaret (W.A.) has cleaned up 250 tons
for 3940 z. from its Vosperton property. This ore is taken
from the end of the drive further out than the limit of
the upper workings, and consequently gives a clear 400 ft.
of hacks to the surface. Property looks very promising.
Mill, so far, has only run 12 hours daily owing to scarcity
of water.

From the Burra, the one-time S. Aus. copper
town, which for 25 years past has always been just on
the eve of resurrection, but is still dead:-“No sane
resident now expects the Burra mine to be working again
this century. True, tenders are to be called to clear the
drain leading from the shaft to Burra Creek, but it is not
likely' to do much. A more than ordinarily tired boy with a
wheelbarrow could clear said drain within a week. This
move was made by the directors to ease the minds of
local shareholders who hinted that their money was all
going in directors’fees. The Magnetic Extraction plant,
erected several months ago to treat dumps, has not got to
work yet. The made-in-Germany process would not
treat ore, and roasters are now being erected to try and
remedy matters.” What seems to be most the matter
with the Burra is that the largest shareholders, who are
mostly fat as the result of the old richness of the mine,
are also rrow very' ancient, and won’t risk any' money
prospecting for the lost ore-body ; and, as the State was
fool enough to sell the freehold of the mine, there isn’t
any law to compel the ancients to let anybody else have
a try.

Mount Garnet has come to an inglorious end.
A reconstruction scheme is proposed, but shareholders
will be wise to decline to have anything to do with it. It
will mean throwing good money away after bad. Mine as
far as developed is worked out, and there is no prospect
of any discovery which will be likely to redeem it, starting
as it will, under the suggested scheme, with a heavy
incubus of debt. As a zinc mine something might be
done with it on starvation wages.
Waihi (Maoriland) put up a splendid record for
1902. Ore treated, 179,485 tons, producing £521,574
worth of bullion, a trifle under £3 per ton. Profit was
£273,737, out of which four divs. of 4s. 6d. were paid.
There are 500,000 shares in the co., and their market
value is about £5 7s. 6d. each, equivalent to about a 12
years’ purchase at the present rate of div., which is high
enough. Considering that a massive formation is being
worked, .that the ore is amenable to simple treatment,
and that there is the great advantage of water-power,
working .expenses seem excessive, but as long as share-
holders draw 50 per cent, on the capital so long will they
be satisfied and refuse to worry about economy.

The criminal waste of land by Maoriland dredg-
ing co’s. is becoming a burning question in the southern
portion of the State. Thousands upon thousands of
acres are being turned over and rendered utterly useless
for future occupation ; for even a dredge that doesn’t pay
expenses can do wonders at converting good land into a
howling waste of gravel and boulders. The Legislature
is to be asked to do the usual “ something ” in the in-
terests of posterity. What that something is the Lord
only knows.

A rise of over 100 per cent, in the value of

“Jaybell”: Pagel’s lion-tossing performance didn’t
come to a head on that remarkable horse-hoister’s first
night in Brisbane. The king of beasts stood on whatever
small scrap of dignity the mighty Herr hasn’t pounded
out of him, and defied the programme. An excited
flunkey with a crowbar only tended to heighten his
resolve to spend a peaceful evening with his own reflec-
tions. But on subsequent nights the strengthy one
waved his acknowledgments to the audience with a
struggling mass of resenting beast of prey in his grip.
All the same, I believe the lion will crawl back to his
cage one of these nights with bits of Herr in his back
teeth, and a coroner’s verdict trailing behind him.
Two men were passing the Bioscope parlor, in which
one may see for Id. a living picture in which a beauteous
damsel undresses with irritating slowness, and the dark-
ness comes down before she has taken off any clothes
worth mentioning after all. “ Here, old man,” cried the
first, “come and have a look at this one. It’s real fine.”
The second glanced at the eyehole. “No thanks,” he
said. “It cost me 10s. the last time I looked at that
one. I looked 120 times to see if she’d take off any
more."
"Melb." : Dorothy Marsden, the Puck of “Midsummer
Night’s Dream,” is quite a unique little personage. You
see directly she bounds on the stage that she is not a
girl, but a woman. Truly the most perfect embodiment
of a grown fairy that ever touched our shores. She would
be the Oberon or Titania if such little mantelpiece people
could be got to match. She is a good deal smaller than
Katie Barry, of the Gaiety. How beautiful she is, and
what an infinitude of wit is hound up in that tiny com-
pass 1
The late Max O’Rell, when in Australia, was consider-
ably perturbed by R. S. Smythe’s advertising tactics.
He used to expostulate politely with the Much Travelled
for laying on the adjectives a little too thickly, and every
time he faced a new audience he had a dread of being-
rejected as a fraud. It is an old story of Max that one
night on arriving at a Victorian country town he hurried
towards the local hall, where the whole population
appeared to be flocking. The lecturer’s heart was glad,
until he noticed that a big calico over the doorway bore
the words, “The Lord Only.” This was too much for
O’Rell’g modesty. Could friend Smythe have dared to
lay it on so thick? Then he noticed a smaller announce-
ment on the other side of the calico frame —Admission
Free. “ Ah, no,” said O’Rell, “ that is not like Smythe.
I must have come to the wrong hall.” He had. Smythe’s
pitch for the Prince of Lecturers and Emperor of Humor-
ists was farther up the street.
Though she is still young for a front-rank singer
Frances Saville seems to have already determined on
quitting the opera stage. A couple of months ago she
retired from the Imperial Opera at Vienna, and was
afterwards farewelled at a big concert. Amy Sherwin
has also given up all save casual appearances, and has
settled down to teaching in London. She has already
made a big success in that branch of her work, having
placed John Harrison, hailed as a great tenor, before
London audiences
“ Fiddlededee ” : It is pardonable in the friends of
Ernest Toy to allege that he didn’t get a fair show in
Melbourne. The admirers of an unsuccessful artist
always blame the newspapers, or the management, or
the public. In this case, they seem to have ignored the
fact that Mr. Toy made a Melb. appearance before a big
musical crowd, at an Orpheus Society concert, two days
previous to his first recital. He had the chance to set
the Yarra on fire, and the conflagration didn’t happen.
There is nothing in Ernest Toy’s art of fiddling. No
richness of tone, nothing that appeals to the 99 per cent,
of the public who are uninterested in the technicalities
of his craft. To speak quite plainly, it was not to be ex-
pected that so ordinary an artist could excite any
enthusiasm from a public who have Albert Zelman
always with them. Toy has been to Europe. Young
Zelman has never, or hardly ever, been out of Melbourne.
Just now, he is conducting the orchestra at the Prin-
cess’s and otherwise earning his bread by taking pupils,
mostly older than himself one supposes. But, the other
Saturday afternoon, he popped up at the Town Hall to
play the solo in Bruch’s concerto for violin, with Marshall
Hall’s orchestra at his back. He had the misfortune to
break a string, or two strings, before completing the
second number. Nevertheless, he knocked the audience.
Zelman, jun., is to-day the brightest man violinist Mel
bourne has heard since Musin was around. Almost
genius, and quite unpretentious.
The revival of wrestling among our colored brethren in
Melbourne caters for a new element—the female —which
was not counted on during the great wrestling boom of
15 years back. Through all the big matches held during
that period, only one woman was present, the late
Madame Lucy Chambers, who occupied a front seat in the
circle at the contest between Miller and Clarence
Whistler. Her presence was widely commented on at
the time, but 700 women attended Wirth’s circus to see
Buttan Singh wrestle Gunga Brahn, and scarcely a men-
tion was made of the fact, though one of the ’rastlers was
perilously near getting his very abbreviated costume torn
from him on several occasions, and the other also came
dangerously near to being a naked “ brother.” The frank
audacity of Sandow in coming before a mixed audience
wearing only a few inches of leopard skin, and the fre-
quent revelations of swimming damsels, has done much
to break down the prudishness of the middle Victorian
era—a period which will be long remembered in the
history of art and beauty as something to be heartily
ashamed of.
T.D. : Re the Tragedy Queen who had invested her
savings in a stewed eels shop, mentioned by actor George
Giddens to an interviewer. The other night I met
Ophelia serving out crude, long beers in an obscure pub.
somewhere in the dark wilderness of a Melbourne lane.
It was late, and she had developed her most histrionic
mood ; drew beer as though she were waving a blood-
grimed poniard, handed me back the change in a stage
whisper, and made casual remarks in blank verse. Also
she threw in an odd quotation or two from Shakspeare.
Quoth I, by way of a test, “ Is this a prologue, or the
posy of a ring?” “ ’Tis brief, my lord,” replied the bar-
lady. Then I became Romeo, as it was getting very late,
and announced “ I must be gone and live, or stay and
die,” and Juliet capped it with —
“ Yon light is not the daylight, know ,I;
It is some meteor that the sun exhales.”
So I remained a little while longer, to discover that e
majestic drawer of beer was once on the boards, in the
roaring old Brooke days, when every actor and actress
slept on the works of the immortal William, knew a dozen
of his plays line by line, and was ready to play lago or
Rosalind at an hour’s notice. Yet she never got beyond
the stage of “ attendant ” or “ court lady.” ' How many
present-day supers could quote three lines of Shakspeare,
and where is the mummer in Australia who could rattle
off a whole act of “ Macbeth” or “ Othello ”?
Prof. Miller’s farewell to Melbourne was a matter
of theatrical interest for old-timers. Miller has played
his little parts in Shakspearian drama, and could
walk the boards much better than the giant Toothick
who gets vanquished by George Lauri. When he visited
America an enterprising manager staged “As You Like
It,” in order to star the Australian hero as Charles the
Wrestler. Remembering this, George Miln, when he
produced “ Antony and Cleopatra ” at Melb. Opera
House, in 1889, interpolated a silent character—a
prisoner—into the scene of Antony’s final “gaudy night.”
Miller being brought before Antony Miln, was notified, in
dumb show, that he could win his liberty by downing
the Queen’s boss gladiator—Donald Dinnie. Then the
chains were taken from Miller’s wrists, and a bout of
Graeco-Roman wrestling relieved, as it were, the intellec-
tual strain of the classic drama. Some few years previ-
ously Miss Florence Wade engaged Miller to play Charles
the Wrestler at Melbourne Bijou. Also Mons. Victor
was engaged to do a turn with the professor before he
went through the performance of getting, thrown by
young Orlando. Miss Wade’s season proved a terrible
frost, and the two athletes got instructions to put in
as much work as they liked for their money.
Miller had instructions not to hurl Victor to the ground
inside of five minutes. After that he was to go for all he
was worth, and win his first fall and look horribly dan-
gerous when Orlando faced him. Victor’s game was to
get Miller a bit winded in those first five minutes, and
then give him as slippery a time as possible. Some nights
the little ’un made Miller toil for nearly half-an-hour.
The present scribe has in his mind’s eye a picture of Duke
Frederick, Rosalind, Celia, and Touchstone the clown,
grinning with delight at Miller’s discomfiture. Poor Phil
Day, the Touchstone of the occasion, had his watch half-
hidden in the palm of his hand and was furtively timing
the struggle. Victor’s trickiness combined with Miller’s
want of condition tended to prolong Shakspeare’s
“ delightful comedy ” to a late hour, but the public
didn’t mind.
Adelaide Critic has a weary, silly habit of misrepre-
senting paragraphs from The Bulletin theatrical columns
in order to gird at something this journal did not say.
The trick grows monotonous. Last week the Critic
said: “The Bulletin gets on to ‘My Lady Molly’
as ridiculous, because Miss Florence Young mas-
qnerading as a man would deceive nobody. Did
The Bulletin ever see a girl masquerading as a man in
comic opera with the intention of deceiving anybody?"
The reply to that question is “Yes, all the time.”
Every girl who masquerades as a man is supposed
for purposes of dramatic fiction to be deceiving some-
body or everybody in the story. And The Bulletin
notice of “My Lady Molly” complained that the
pretence of deception in this case was obviously absurd,
not because Miss Young masqueraded as a man, but
because she was represented as deceiving the man
(Harold Thorley) whose clothes she was supposed to be
masquerading in. “He doesn’t note the glaring
fact that the clothes he left in his portmanteau couldn’t
possibly fit a figure 6in. shorter than his own.” Can
the Critic mention any other comic opera or comedy
wherein the heroine is supposed to deceive her lover, half
a foot taller than herself, by presenting a tightly fitted
figure in the tall man’s togs ? Surely a man is supposed
to know, within half a foot or so, the height of his own
clothes ?
“Where’s ‘Hop’?”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[For the first time in many years an issue
of The Bulletin —that of May 23rd, 1903—has
appeared with no work by Livingstone Hopkins
between the red covers.]
The blessed world is upside down,
The times are out of joint;
We cluster, and with earnest frown,
Discuss the knotty point.
And all for “ Whys ” and “ Wherefores " seek,
And various notions swop—
The Bulletin came out this week
Without a sign of “ Hop ” !
We know his humor—keen and gay—
That mocks the moment’s whim ;
We’ve seen our Bulletin to-day
And found no trace of him.
And so around the big camp-fire—
As in the city shop—
We lift our voices to inquire :
“Hi! What’s become of ‘ Hop
The lads recall the various jokes
By which he’s “ rubbed it in
His very monniker provokes
The reminiscent grin.
And now despair is all our share,
And woe has come to stop ;
O ! Fate in editorial chair,
What has become of “ Hop
Ah, newer men rise, one by one
And we admire, of course,
The opulence of Vincent’s fun,
And Lindsay’s graphic force.
But still we oldsters can’t forget
The years he’s been on top ;
And whilst we praise the others, yet
We love and swear by “ Hop ” 1

.jondon Times (3/4/’O3) in an account of
Hector M‘Donald’s funeral:
The War Office did not know officially that the late
general was married, and, consequently, it is understood,
messages after Sir Hector’s death were sent to his brother
and other relatives in Scotland.
So, after all his glory and his share m ouilding
the Empire, the fluffy, tight-laced, whale-boned
crew hadn’t the common decency to recognise the
existence of its star-performer’s honest wife.
Premier See says the Government intends
to extend the area of the Western Division—that
already vast portion of the State which has been
given over to three Commissioners with instruc-
tions to do the best with it they can, ordinary
administration having proved a dead failure. The
extension of the area is an admission that even
more of the country is hopeless, so far as ordinary
settlement goes, than had been supposed.
B. R. Wise, on behalf of the N.S.W.
Govt., replied to the dismal complaints and
plausible mis-statements of the Freetrade papers,
when given a taste of their own Freetrade.
Evening News printed his letter as it was sent.
The D.T. chopped it to pieces and sandwiched
it with columns of comment, whereupon Mr. Wise
protested to that paper :
Since you publish in this morning’s issue of your paper
my statement with regard to the free carriage of news-
papers in your own way, I should be glad if you could
now see your way to give it in mine. Ido not object to
any comments, provided my statement is set out con-
secutively and in a form comprehensible to your readers.
I cannot think that the way in which you have published
the statement complies with either of these requirements.
But the D.T. didn’t take any notice. What
better argument could that newspaper put into
the mouths of its opponents than this partial sup-
pression of a Government reply to its criticisms ?
The law is behaving strangely again in
Victoria. Six years ago a Beechworth farmer
took his child in his arms and jumped down a
well. They fished him out alive, but not the
child, and he was tried for murder. Insanity was
pleaded, and he was acquitted, the usual order
being made that he should be confined during the
Governor’s pleasure. The man’s wife has been
living on the farm since then, supporting the
family (six children). Lately the farmer, who
is still in gaol, decided that he would sell
the farm, and instructed a lawyer to move
for a warrant to eject his wife; and the
court found that it must grant the application.
So the position is this: If the man is still
insane the court has acted on a lunatic's applica-
tion to turn his wife and family out of their
home; and if he is sane, having (as is alleged)
recovered, then by being still confined he is being
punished for doing something when he was insane
and unaccountable for his actions. Either way
the law has a good deal to answer for.


TRIUMPHANT PROOF
are the medical possibilities disclosed by Science. The mysterious, agonising, “incurable” diseases of yesterday are to-day
treated and cured effectively and speedily. Students of Electro-Physiology declare that those ailments (such as
INDIGESTION, LIVER COMPLAINTS, NEURALGIA, GOUT, GENERAL DEBILITY, SCIATICA, RUPTURES,
At , nmo , . . , PARALYSIS, KIDNEY DISORDERS, ATROPHY, MENTAL IMPAIRMENT, WEAKNESS, and FUNCTIONAL
DISORDERS which may be traced to EXHAUSTION OF NERVE POWER, and to the diminished energy ,of the vital functions consequent upon this
exhaustion) are specially amenable to cure by Electricity. As a curative agent it is fast becoming most beneficial, established upon a sound scientific basis. It is
especially effective in the cure of OUS DISORDERS, in the dissipation of pain and the enticement of sleep. There is no questioning the certain quality of
its power.

“Kati-Kati”j Do you know anything
about happiness ! It seems to me that there is
only a fixed amount of happiness in this world,
and we can neither increase nor decrease it—
merely distribute it. When the locusts are thick
on the corn the farmer’s happiness is lessened to
the extent of the sum total of happiness among
the locusts. There is the same amount of happi-
ness in a suit of clothes covering either a mere
man or a man tormented with fleas, but in the
latter case the fleas have some of it. In disease,
the microbes are having a devilish good time. To
prove this theory by experiment, kill the cat that
merrily singeth on your roof at midnight, and
you will feel the happiness that had been its
soaking into you at once.
The other day, a casual young Maori-
landress, of Napier, submitted, with great
emphasis, a vote of want of confidence in the

Monday morning’s wash when she remarked that
her toothache was pretty bad, and she thought the
things wouldn’t hurt for another half-hour’s soak
or so. Then she “ retreated, ” but appeared later
on and resumed operations at the tub. And
nothing would have been known for certain of
what had happened in that half-hour or so if, a
few days after, two small infants hadn’t been
fished out of a local waterhole. Two of them !

THE FAMOUS REMEDY FOR
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, AND CONSUMPTION,
HAS THE . LARGEST SALE OF ANY CHEST MEDICINE IN AUSTRALIA.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or
Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com-
forting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has
never been known to exist where “ Coughs " have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a Complete Cure is certain.

TOO ILL TO LEAVE HIS BED.
A COMPLETE CURE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.—Dear Sir, —I am writing to tell you
about, the wonderful cure your medicine has effected in
my case. About three years ago I began to cough. At
first the cough was not severe, but it gradually got worse,
and I became very weak and troubled with night sweats,
pain in iny chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On
several occasions there was blood in the expectorated
matter. I had been treated by a doctor, who pronounced
my case to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage
that I heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for
a course of the medicine. When It arrived I was too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure, for
which accept my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,
J. BLAIR.

A Child Seven Months OUL
A SUFFERER FROM BIRTH.
CURED BY A BOTTLE OF HEARNE’S
BRONCHITIS CURE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir,—Kindly forward me a
small bottle of your Bronchitis Cure as soon as possible,
asl cannot speak above a whisper, owing to a cold. I
had a bottle from you before for my little girl when she
was seven months old. She had been suffering from
bronchitis from her birth, and now she is 3 years old, and
has not had a return of it since. It is a splendid medi-
cin for bronchitis or colds of any sort.
I remain, yours truly,
Mrs. H. RAMAGE.

“Mr. Hearne.—
“ Dear Sir,—l am very much pleased with the effects
of your Bronchitis Cure. Last winter three of my chil-
dren had very bad coughs, and one bottle cured the
three of them. The housemaid also had such a severe
cold that she entirely lost her voice, but half a bottle
cured her. I always keep it in the house now, and re-
commend it to anyone requiring a medicine of that kind.
“ I now want you to send at once four bottles to E in-
land to my mother, who is suffering greatly from bron-
chitis. The address is enclosed.

“Mr. W. G. Hearne, Geelong.—
“ Dear Sir, —
Your letter and Bronchitis Cure to hand quite safe.
I am sure you will he glad to know that your Bronchitis
Cure has quite cured me. I was very glad when it came,
as I was suffering from a severe attack of Bronchitis at the
time it arrived. I had sent for my own doctor, hut had
not had one night’s rest for a week. I started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only' every night for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, I was quite well, and walked into
town and hack without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that previously for 12 months —always went in the
omnibus—as walking caused me such pain and distress in
the chest. I always walk now’, and never feel it, and I
am stronger than I have been for years. I thank my son
for his great kiudnes# vn sending the medicine, and am,
dear Sir,
-Yours very truly,
“M. MORTIMER.
Extract from a letter, since written by the same lady to
her son, Mr. John S. Mortimer, Llenwellyn, Katunga,
Victoria.
HER DAUGHTER HAD BEEN VERY ILL,
SPITTING UP BLOOD.
THE DOCTOR SAID NOTHING MORE COULD BE
DONE.
CURED BY IIEARNE S BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extract runs as follows :—“ As for myself, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, blit Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. I feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ I must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do —send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since I commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since I wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
never had a night’s rest, and was spitting up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there .was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did net require any more medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some of my next supply.”

“ Sir.—My wife was for twelve years a sufferer from

be removed or even eased by any remedy, doctors’

A Seven Tears’ Case.
EXPECTORATING BLOOD AND MATTER.
COMPLETELY CURED.
“ Mr. W. G. Hearne.
“ Dear Sir, —Your medicine has cured me of bronchitis
and asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven
years, during which period I was scarcely ever free from
coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so
distressing that for nights in succession I had to sit up.
I write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty, as
in my case every other treatment had failed. For a year
previous I had been getting very much worse, and at the
time I obtained your medicine I was confined to bed
suffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blood
and matter, and apparently beyond hope of recovery.
The first dose of the medicine gave me welcome relief,
and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment,
until I became, as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely,
H. WALKER, Balmain, Sydney."
Asthma.
PREVIOUS TREATMENT FAILED.
A SEVENTEEN YEARS’ CASE.
CURED BY THREE BOTTLES.
Mr. Alex. J. Anderson, of Oak Park, Charlevilie,
Queensland, writes :—“After suffering from Asthma for
17 years, and having been under a great many different
treatments without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’a
medicine for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this
medicine I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then
which was in the beginning of 1883— 15 years ago—l hav
not had the slightest return of it. The medicine qui
cured me, and I have much pleasure in recommending it.
Writing again on the 4th April, 1899, he states:—* I
am keeping very well now. Never have the slightesi
eturn of the Asthma.”

The Advice of Two Doctors.
“ 44, Garden Reach, Calcutta, India,
“May 22nd, 1902.
“Dear Sirs,—Last year I was advised by two
Doctors to take Kutnow’s Powder, and for the
last twelve months I have taken a dose every
morning with very few exceptions. I must say
that I am quite a different man since I have been
taking it; in fact, better in every way. Yours
very sincerely,
“JOHN G. COXON.
“THE MEDICAL JOURNAL”
November, 1902, says :
“Disorder? of the liver —whether arising from excessive or deficient
secretion of bile, with such well-known characteristic symptoms as headache,
nausea, pain in the abdomen, diarrhoea, and low spirits; or with the
important symptoms of dyspepsia, such as constipation, a feeling of
abnormal fullness or emptiness, heart-burn, an offensive taste, foul
breath, a furred tongue, flatulence, irregular heart action, an emaciated
countenance, drowsiness, and languor—these are now most successfully
treated by Kutnow’s Powder.
“This preparation is composed of the active principles of the most
famous European mineral spring waters, and as such forms a natural
antiseptic aperient, relieving at once any congestion of the hepatic portal
system. It acts as a solvent, loosening all hard faecal matter which may
have accumulated, and eliminating the same without any suggestion of
griping or pain.
“ Amongst the many eminent specialists who have commended Kutnow’s
Powder in the highest terms, we note the names of Sir Andrew Clark, M.D.,
Sir More 11 Mackenzie, M.D„ and Professor Lawson Tait, M.D.
“We may add that Kutnow’s Powder, although containing no sugar,
is pleasant to the taste, decidedly refreshing, and is well sustained by
the most delicate stomach. It produces an immediate sense of relief, or,
to put it in the words of a patient, ‘lt seems to at once take away a load
of trouble.’”

NOT one of these things we illustrate to-day has been shown before. They are all new—some of
them have hardly got the wrappers off as we write. They are pretty and serviceable—suited both
for personal wear and gift giving. There is not a common style in the lot and the make and finish are
quite equal to our usual high-grade goods, if you are particular as to what you buy in our line then
nowhere else can you go if you would select from a stock so large—so varied that it is an uncommon

It reproduces the human voice to such a fine point, that in listening

O’Rorke.
POLITICAL POINTS
Sitting at the cashier’s desk of one of the busiest
bars in town, raking the stuff in with both hands,
and spending her soul (what’s left of it) 16 hours
a day. Gold-topped, rouge-tinted, velveted,
chained and bejewelled ; just a sneer on her face
as a curse or a groan comes down the back stair-
way. That is Agnes to-day. Is it the same
woman we knew, hatchet-faced, hawk-eyed, slat-
ternly, running a boarding-house on the railway
works ? Of whom an old navvy would say to a
traveller, “Ask her for a feed 1 My poor man,
ye had better ask the rock in the face beyant 1 ”
The very The same, too, who came into
Waipapa 10 years earlier as Mrs. Middleton. Her
husband signed himself Arthur Middleton, Capt.
He had manners, seemed to have money ; but no
memory whatever of recent experiences in the
service. There was an odor of Sunday-school and
bread-and-butter about her then, and the towns-
folk took to her kindly ; but Arthur Middleton,
Capt., was not well-disposed towards social inter-
course. He bought a farm a few miles back in
the foot of the hills, laid in a stock of liquor, and
began deliberately to drink to a finish. It took
about four months. At the end of that time the
buggy came rattling into town, and Agnes
Middleton got down at the hotel, all dishevelment
and tears ; while George, the man, went round to
the police, the doctor, and the undertaker. Then
there was an outflow, or rather an outgush, of
sympathy for the poor widow. Every house in
the town was opened to her, and in a little while
she accepted the invitation of the doctor’s wife •
not having, so far, paid the doctor’s bill. The
doctor couldn’t dun his own guest, but for all
that he shunted her on to the parson within a
month, and a week later sent a collector round.
Parson felt something queer in a week or two, and
offered Nathan, the jeweller, a chance. Nathan got
to the bottom of it in 48 hours, and the widow went
to the hotel, where the landlord thought it better
that her meals should be served in private. Then
the sergeant of police looked in, and suggested
the advisability of taking up quarters in a larger
town—Christchurch, say, or Wellington. But
she looked him in the face with steely eyes (all
the bread-and-butter and Sunday-school absorbed
in patchouli now), and insisted on her ability and
intent to manage her own affairs. She proposed
to settle in that little town of Waipapa. She
might open a school or a fancy-needlework estab-
lishment. The sergeant talked about creditors.
She replied that Mr. Finn, her lawyer, would see
to that ; and, though they came up in battalions,
Finn did. “Three thousand pounds worth of
diamonds upon her,” was whispered through the
audience, but nothing on which a sheriff’s officer
could levy.
Old Nathan smiled when he heard it; smiled
and was silent. It was not Nathan’s habit to
eulighten fools.
The Widow Middleton had an establishment
then, and Finn, the lawyer, and Trott, the racing
man, and Petrie, at the store—who had seen life
in Melbourne—used to come round in the evening
bringing various contributions of grog for supper.
No harm to them, but one night they must bring
little Paddy Welsh along. Paddy was two-and-
twenty ; as happy and combustible an Irish boy
as ever wore a shamrock. The pink-and-white,
set in the black-and-white, did for Paddy in an
hour. Next day he was down on his knees, and
she was saying, “I do love you very much, but
without money it is quite impossible.”
“ I could raise a hundred,” said Paddy, “ per-
haps two, and once my people saw you they’d
divide the last pound with us.”
“ If you could be sure of a thousand.”
“ How would I be getting a thousand ? ”
“ I don’t know, and I don’t care. Get it and
come to me and—She stooped down and kissed
his feverish lips.
She bought him with that kiss—body and soul;
and it cost some of us wild and desperate work to
bu}’ him back.
There were six-and-twenty draught colts run-
ning in a 10,000-acre paddock, 12 miles out of
Waipapa. If the boundary-rider saw them once
a week he reckoned it good enough. They were
worth in those days from £4O to £6O each. Paddy
had talked with the boundary-rider the day
before. At one o’clock next morning he went by
a back track out of town, riding one good horse
and leading another. The day passed as usual,
but at eight o’clock next morning a sharp tap
came on the widow’s door, and when Finn opened
it the sergeant pulled him outside. He was a
good while away, and when the lot went out to
see what the trouble might be, we heard the
sergeant say, “ If I could give her seven years as
well, I’m damned if I’d save him.”
Finn said, “Come along to the pub,” and we
went without saying good-bye to the widow.
Once inside, it was blurted right out. “That
young fool, Paddy, has shook Masop’s colts and
is driving them towards Porter’s Pass.”
“ How do you know that? ” asked Trott.
“ Bindon,” answered Finn. (Bindon was the
sergeant.)
Then Con, Paddy’s brother, broke out. “Finn!
Finn ! Ye’re a murtherin’ villain to beguile the
poor boy into the arms of that sorceress.” But
Trott, the racing man, cut him short. “There’s
nobody going to be hanged, nor yet lagged, if
everyone here keeps his lips closed, and two up-
river men will ride out with me in half-an-hour.”
Trott had two hurdle-racers in training, and
there were a dozen good hacks in the stables. We
rode three of the worst for 20 miles, and led the
jumpers and the best of the lot. Then unsaddled,
turned the spare beasts into a gully, as arranged,
and mounted those that would have to do the
work.
Paddy had 48 hours’ start. He might knock
near 80 miles out of the colts in that time, but
they would get stiffer and sorer with every mile,
and we reckoned on covering 100 miles in 12 hours,
if necessary.
The moon was full and clear, and the track
hard and smooth. A stumble against some jut-
ting piece of shale was the only serious risk. Hour
after hour we rode, Trott generally ten lengths
ahead. Nearer and nearer, and higher and higher,
rose the tremendous mountain-range, cleft by the
high pass. No man would believe that, when
daylight flushed the peaks, it was still 80 miles
distant. An hour later brought us to the big
river. Trott rolled off and unsaddled ; then from
a bit of valise produced—what? Breakfast? Not
much. A dozen good-sized carrots ! He gave
his horse twenty gulps of water, and bade us do
likewise ; sliced the carrots then, and cursed Tom
Wilkes for a life-robber when he slipped a bit
into’ his own mouth. Trott knew horses as a
mother of ten knows babies.
We got Paddy’s tracks both sides of the river,
and we sighted him an hour before noon. He
hadn’t done 70 miles from the paddock, and was
as dead-beat himself as the fattest of the colts.
“ Where d’ye get ’em, Paddy ? ” asked Trott.
“ Cunning beggar, you, to head us off that way.
The reward ’ll be a hundred, sure.”
Then Paddy’s head went down on the horse’s
mane, and he cried, like the silly boy he was.
We were 30 miles towards home, when, out of
the dust-cloud, emerged Mason, with overseer and
boundary-riders, and Bindon with two troopers—
carbines slung and steel scabbards flashing.
_ Mason rubbed his chin, while Trott explained
till the stubble crackled with electricity; but it
was hard to quarrel with Trott, and the rest of us
were very faithful echoes.
So little Paddy was saved from gaol and worse,
and the widow’s evenings were left desolate.
Bindon wanted her out of the town ; and so did
everybody else, and it was reckoned that there
was about evidence enough to go upon, when a
new development occurred. O’Rorke came to
town with ten ounces of gold cable across his
stomach and sovereigns jingling in both breeches-
pockets. He had finished a big road-contract and
was worth a few thousand. So at least other folks
said, and he did not contradict. O’Rorke ran up
against the widow, and she went through him.
He had a glass of wine next night and saw the
diamonds. Three days later a wagonette with
O’Rorke and the widow, rid of her weeds, on the
box-seat, drove up to the church, and the parson
did his business and pocketed the fee.
Next day O’Rorke faced his bride and said,
“Agnes, I’ve desaved ye.”
The steel hardened in the eyes of Agnes. “It
is just as well to be straightforward,” she said.
“ Barring a hundred sovereigns in my belt and
the watch and chain, here —worth maybe a hun-
dred more—l’m a poor man, Agnes.”
“ It is just as well to be straightforward,” said
Agnes without much emotion.
“It is money we must have, Agnes; and there
is only one way of getting it.”
She unlocked her box and took out a green
velvet case. Within it lay a necklace of “ dia-
monds”; wonders of stones, all. “Nathan will
let us have a thousand on that.”
“ He should.”
“ Take it to him, then; but, wait a moment.
Just let me have that gold and your watch and
chain. If you get the thousand, how do I know
that I shall ever see you again ? ”
He unloaded without a word, and went away to
Nathan’s with the diamonds next his heart.
Ten minutes later Agnes’ boxes were on an ex-
press waggon and she was driving like mad for
the beach, where the last surf-boat was putting
off to a northern-bound steamer.
O’Rorke had to wait an hour for Nathan, and
then, said the latter, “Pat, you are cooked like
one dinner. These are very good paste, Pat.
Good stage props, and I will buy them right out
for 355.”
There was wild work in the town of Waipapa
that night. The “force” got O’Rorke inside
with difficulty and bloodshed. It was a fiver or a
month in the morning, and, as the landlord’s
bailiffs were in the house, the alternative had to
be taken. When the month was ended ca. sa. and
ca. re. appeared, and O’Rorke went to the “ other
side ” for his wife’s debts.
But Mrs. O’Rorke had begun to find the world
small, or otherwise, and news of all sorts most in-
conveniently winged. Nobody seemed to know
her, nobody would know her in Christchurch, ex-
cept the police and those of her own sex to whose
level she had not vet sunk. She was the daughter
of a small country shopkeeper, and the huckster’s
instincts were dominant in her in all crises. The
high-flying game was done; why not make some
use of O’Rorke ? The beast could at least work,
and he would be humble now and thankful for re-
lease. A sum of £4O squared the creditors, who
were already sick of maintenance fees, and one
sunny spring day the blusterer, subdued and
emaciated, stepped down the street, his soberly-
clad missus tripping beside him.
She fed and clothed him, nursed him up, and
brought back his manhood and strength; then
broached her plans. He must get a billet as
ganger on a railway. She would start a shop on
the works—no matter what sort. Grog would be
sold. Navvies earned plenty of money, and why
should not some deserving people get some of it ?
O’Rorke jibbed at first; he had always been a
man amongst men. But at length he yielded,
and had better have stayed in gaol. For Agnes
worked out her plans remorselessly as success-
fully, cajoling all who promised plunder as the
boa-constrictor slimes over its prey before swallow-
ing. The hatred of the men came to him, and he
sought to retaliate by driving them harder and
harder in the interests of the boss. But the boss
had only a contemptuous nod for him as he rode
by, and brother gangers, even on Sunday, slewed
round their backs if he entered the gangers’ parlor
at the pub.
He jumped one night when Agnes said, “ I
don’t think I’ll follow the works any farther.
There’s more fools and more money, too, in town.”
“And what shall I be doing ?”
“Keeping them up in their traces, of course, as
usual; and drawing your own pay, and sending
me —well, say, half.”
He had no heart to argue or rebel, and was
only silently dumbfounded when next day the
boss said, “We won’t want you any more,
O’Rorke.’’
She had to take him along, but he went to sleep
in the threepenny bar and got transferred to the
cockloft, with the offside man to carry up drinks ;
the doctor looking in just for decency’s sake, and
the undertaker waiting. But the agents speak of
Alice O’Rorke as a “warm woman,” and share-
brokers “set ’em up” quick and lively in her
parlors, and the bank-manager nods affably if he
chances to cross the banking-hall as she brings in
her bag. “ Shouldn’t be surprised to see her die a
woman of six figures,” says the brewer’s traveller,
“ if —she keeps off it.”
FRANK MYERS.
Dunedin is more crowded than ever with
horribly good people since the Torrey-Alexander
mission came to the damp city, and the place is
full of hymns. Recently a party of cheerful
Christian Endeavorers ascended Mount Flag-
staff, and fell by the way on a hut containing a
distressed family—husband out of work, and wife
ill in bed with a week-old infant on hand, and
mighty few assets of any kind. The Endeavorers
didn’t pass the hat round or do a few “chores” ;
they sang “Count your blessings ; name them one
by one.” Another evening, after a hot and
sensual meeting at the Garrison Hall, a swarm of
Christian Endeavorers rushed the horse tram to
go home, and loaded it to its last available inch of
standing room. The two tortured mokes struggled
desperately to get their huge burden up the awful
Princes-street hill, and the Endeavorers didn’t
get out and push; they sang “You can help a
load to lighten as you go.” The singing was,
fortunately, interrupted by a heathen who used
such language to the crowd that at last it did get
off and walk up the hill. But it lightened the
load under very much protest.


THE following case of Mr. Elliott Watkins, of Lady Robinson’s Beach, Rockdale is
a fitting illustration of the wonderful efficacy of Bile Beans in curing the most
severe cases of Indigestion and Biliousness. This gentleman says “ For a period
of over four years I was a sufferer with Indigestion and Biliousness, the symptoms
which troubled me most being a dizzi-
ness in the head, accompanied by a
languid feeling, and a most perpetual
and intolerable headache. My stomach
was distended after eating, and violent
gnawing pains attacked me in the chest,
breathing at times being most distress-
ing. I was also greatly troubled by fits
of vomiting, when I would be utterly
prostrated and temporarily deprived of
sight for a period extending over hours.
I consulted several doctors, who pre-
scribed for me, without giving more
than temporary relief. At the solicita-
tion of a friend I tried Bile Beans,
though I did not anticipate any good
resulting. To my surprise the first box
gave relief, and after a month or so,
Bile Beans did for a few shillings what
doctors failed to do for many pounds
during many months of trial. I give
this testimony most freely and gladly, hoping that others who know me may be induced,
should they be attacked in a similar manner to myself, to give Bile Beans a trial.”
■
BILE BEANS have now a world-wide reputation for curing BILIOUSNESS
HEADACHE. INDIGESTION, CONSTIPATION, PILES, DEBILITY, NERVOUS-
NESS, BAD BLOOD, PIMPLES, AND ALL SKIN ERUPTIONS, BAD BREATH,
ANAEMIA, RHEUMATISM, INFLUENZA, COUGHS and COLDS, and will fortify
the system to withstand the changeable weather of the present season. Bile Beans are
obtainable from all medicine vendors, price Is. l£d, or 2s. 9d large box (contains three

The Sorceress.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My lover travels through the world
And seven years more shall roam
Before, soft shining through his dreams,
My beauty draws him home.
Salt of the wave, brown of the sun,
Deep scarred of dragon claws,
Leaped from the cruel wild boar’s tusks,
Safe from the kraken’s jaws,
Loved by the fairest of the earth,
Yet one he seeks piore fair ;
And all his loves are worthy him—
Red, gold, and raven hair.
In magic crystal still they pass,
They charm him with their spells ;
A little while they keep my love
From the place where his true love dwells.
* • * •
The poppies wave in the sunlight white,
And the wine-red blossoms glow:
The Persian woman would keep him there,
Down where the roses blow.
Let her keep him and teach him the secret
The poppy holds at the core—
Free from the spell of her weaving,
He is out on the quest once more.
Down in the golden sea caves
A mermaid has lured him to stay ; ,
Her eyes, as clear as the wave heart,
Were melting his soul away.
A dryad gleams through the tree trunks,
He follows close through the wood —
She would keep him prisoned for ever,
Yet I know that my charm holds good.
• * • •
From golden hair and hair of black
My love to me shall yet coine back.
From nut-brown hair and hair of red
Surely to me my love is led.
From hazel eyes and eyes of blue
He comes, my arrow winging true.
From eyes of black and eyes of green
He seeks the eyes his dreams have seen.
From sword and spear and stealthy knife
My charms shall win his waning life.
From tiger’s claw-and scorpion’s sting
Still hold him safe, my'magie ring !
From sprite, nymph, wizard, witch, and gnome
Quick, charms, and draw my true love home !
WILD BEE.
An Up-to-date Scandal.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Allard came in out of the sun, which had filled
the garden with the odor of flowers.
In the drawing-room he found Lottie by herself,
her usually pale face flushed, and her cheeks
wet with tears.
“ O,” she said, “I am so glad you have come.
He has been ill-treating me again.”
And she tore the little glove she had in her
hand, from between the fingers to the buttons.
Allard breathed heavily.
“ Ah, the brute ! ” she continued, “just because
I was late for breakfast.”
“ Well—well ?” demanded Allard.
‘ ‘ He struck me ! ”
“ Struck you ? ”
“Yes, struck me with the newspaper—and in
front of the servants.”
Allard doubled his fists.
“ I wish,” he said, “I were in a better position
—morally—so that I could make him regret it all.’’
Lottie caught him by the coat.
“Come. You’re a great big lump of a man,”
she said ; “ why don’t you punch him ? ”
“O—oh, it is< impossible,” exclaimed Allard,
shutting his eyes and waving his head as though
to avoid something in the air.
“ Ah, that’s what you always say. I begin to
think you cannot love me sufficiently.”
And Lottie showed her short white teeth for a
minute.
“ Well,” said Allard, “ I shall do it.”
“Yes. I’m glad to hear you talk that way. It
makes me happy to feel that I have so much
strength and determination on my side.”
“ And,” continued Allard, “when shall it be?
To-morrow when ”
“No, no,” burst in the woman. “Let us
do away with to-morrow altogether. To-night!
To-night! O, yes,” she went on, “we will brazen
it out. We will tell him, here, in this room,
together, just as we are standing now. He will
learn how we love each other, and how nothing
on earth can part us. And then you will thrash
him and we will go out into the night, away under
the stars, and through the sobbing pines, into the
bright world of eternal love.”
Allard trembled before this terrible display of
passion, and proportionately weakened as she
gained strength.
The noise of a watch-case snapping made them
both look round.
They saw the man of whom they had been
speaking. He was fat and healthy-looking, and
very neatly dressed.
“ I must have come home a little early,” he re-
marked ; and without so much as a glance at
Allard, whom he hardly knew, he sat down in a
comfortable arm-chair and selected a book.
The woman put her hand on his shoulder, and,
when he had stuck a marker between the pages,
he troubled himself to look up.
“Arthur,” she said, “I have come to a con-
clusion.”
“ Have you ? ” he answered.
“Yes, I have. We were not meant for one
another —however we may have thought so at one
time. And, also, lam not the woman to stand a
blow from any man.”
“ Pshaw ! A playful pat with the paper.’’
Allard looked uneasy. He did not feel quite up
to breaking a man’s head in for just tapping any-
one on the face. The misdeed hardly merited
such a punishment, especially if it devolved on
him to carry it out.
“ Well, and is there anything else ? ” asked the
fat man, readjusting his spectacles and opening
the book.
“Of course there is,” cried Lottie; “you know
yourself what must follow.”
, The man poked his head forward in an insolent,
listening attitude.
“ I am going,” she said ; “I am going.”
“Then go, for goodness sake, but don’t make
such a fuss about it,” he replied, with vehemence.
“I am going away,” she continued, “for ever
and ever. You will never see me again. Allard,
here, will protect me and take me to the world’s
end.”
“’Pon my word,” muttered the fat man,
getting out of his ohair, “this is becoming serious.
Really, I am deeply grieved. It is all so hideously
unusual. You actually propose to leave the com-
fortable home of your lover, where you have
everything you want, and, in exchange, you seek
—the miserable quarters of your husband ! Go—
go, by all means, never stopping for a moment to
think how you wrong me, how you drag my—my
—my —my reputation for successful immorality
through the mire. But I will not curse you, nor
will I curse your miserable partner by law ”
But Allard and his wife had rushed from the
room, and, as they appeared at the window on
their way to the gate, the fat man threw up the
sash. “Lottie! Lottie!” he cried,.
Thinking she detected a note of remorse in his
voice, the woman turned.
The giant pine trees behind her tossed their
arms in the breeze, and the sound of a breaking
wave came from the beach.
“ What is it ? ” she asked with studied coldness.
“Poor little girl,” he replied, “your hat isn’t
on straight.”
Lottie started.
“ Why didn’t you tell me ?” she said to Allard.
“I —I—er—didn’t notice it,” he stammered,
and stood petrified as his wife walked back to the
house.
She never returned.

HUGH R. M'CRAE.
Johnston’s Girl.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“You should marry, ” Perry said, settling him-
self comfortably on his stool; “marry and be
happy like me.”
Perry was fat.
Johnston laughed.
“ Girl ? ” he asked.
“Plenty of ’em,” Perry answered. “ You’re a
well set-up youngster. They’d rush you.”
“ What about me ? ”
“You’d be happy—like me.”
Perry weighed more pounds than he possessed.
“ I’ll think about it,” Johnston said. He went
on adding up figures. It struck him that Perry
resembled a nought. Alone, he meant nothing.
His value depended on the figure before him, and
he looked happy beside any figure. Matri-
monially, Perry was a cipher.
Perry went out and Johnston pulled a soiled
envelope from his pocket, and laid its contents in
an open drawer so that he could read them. The
handwriting was a girl’s:
Jim, you’ve got a mighty good opinion of me—better
than I deserve. I wish you would modify it, or some
day you will have no opinion at all, and I should not like
that. Sometimes I do very mad things, not because I
know no better. You may not have heard of any of
these, but some day you may, and then —well, perhaps
you’ll be rather disappointed in me. I wish you wouldn’t
worry about me ; you need your brains for your work.
You’re going to be a good man, and I’m not going to be
a drag on you. I’m not good. I can’t help it. But no
one shall say I was not straight with you. And oh !
Jimmy, I wish I could tell everyone what a dear old
fellow you are. The other day, someone asked me who
that long ass was—meaning you. I swore at him. I
couldn’t help it, Jim. Perhaps I’ll reform some day—l’m
only 19. And then I’ll say to you—you are so slow at
speaking, so I must speak for you—“ Will you marry me
now, Jim ? ” And this, of course, I must answer ; and
I’ll say, “Yes.” That is—some day. You have to work,
and so have I. I want to learn how to chase a chop into
a,frying-pan, and what makes my cat wipe her paw over
her ear when it’s going to rain. Also, how to behave my-
self. Fellows often say things to me they should not say.
Don’t get “ scotty ” with them—the faultis mine—l ought
not to give them the chance. But I can’t help laughing
when I see them look like whipped puppies after I’ve
spoken very straight to them. Dear old Jim, I love you
—with both hands, shall we say ? (That is what you are
always saying—“shall we say?”). You are so different
from other men. But you are good and lam bad. With a
great deal of love, I am your Molly.
As Johnston replaced the letter in the envelope
Perry returned to his stool. “Saw a ripping
girl just now,” he remarked. “Tall, graceful——”
“Slab,” Johnston interrupted.
“Make any man happy,” Perry continued,
breathing noisily and wiping his forehead. At
times he was superabundantly fat.
Johnston was silent.
“How do you like ’em ?” Perry persisted .
“ ’Bout a mile away.”
“ Yes, but what shape ? ”
“Nuggetty.”.
Perry was relieved. His wife was lean. Up to
now he had been jealous of Johnston since he had
smiled at Mrs. Perry—only once. Still it was a
smile.
But Johnston wasn’t thinking about Perry’s
wife—there wasn’t enough of her to occupy his
min'd. She occupied Perry’s completely. Perry
was narrow-minded—and newly-married. John-
ston was thinking of a girl who was considered
“fast” by the goody-goody people of .the town-
ship she lived in. She had been his comrade for
many sunny days during a couple of years. They
had sat and sprawled on -the cliffs above the
breakers that hurled their silver and grey plumes
skyward in fruitless endeavor. And she would
suddenly become grave and tell him he must
strive hard, like the breakers, to be a good, great
man. She said his would not be a bootless battle
like the breakers. And he swore as he kissed her
that he would never succeed witliout her. But
she threw his arm aside and said, “ No ; not till 1
can go straight, which I can’t do now.’’
But he was satisfied.
She carried one of his bags to the station when
he left the last time ; and just as the engine
whistled he saw a man point her out to his
comrade and sneer ; and Johnston stepped off the
carriage-platform and knocked the speaker down.
And he remembered that when he got home there
was a letter for him. It ended—
“ Don’t get the blues, and keep going, Jim, I
might reform any day now. —Your Moll.”
“ T’ll wait, ’ Johnston muttered.
“ I beg pardon ? ” Perry said.
“It s going to be wet,” Johnston answered.

Tired All the Time
A Terrible Feeling of Exhaustion. Unfit for Business. Debilitating
Effects of Hot Seasons. All Easily Removed.
m-
Mrs. C. McDonald, of Northcote,
Victoria, Australia, sends us her
photograph, and says:
“I was a great sufferer from some
of the most terrible forms of indiges-
tion. I was all tired out from morn-
ing until night. My languor made me
unfit for work or business of any
kind, and I was about ready to give up
discouraged. My liver was all out of
order, and this made me suffer from
constipation and biliousness. Two
remedies completely cured me. I took
Ayer’s Pills to act on my liver and
keep my bowels in good condition,
and Ayer’s Sarsaparilla to purify my
blood, strengthen my nerves, and put
my digestive organs in a healthy
state.”
“The World's Createst Family Medicine.”
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is of great help to almost every one in this debilitating
climate. It prevents exhaustion, keeps the nervous system in good order,
and takes away all that tired feeling. Don’t wait until you are down sick.
It s much wiser and easier to prevent sickness. When the stomach fails,
sickness comes very easy. Profit by Mrs. McDonald’s experience and put your
digestive organs in a healthy state.
We must caution you against imitation Sarsaparillas. Be sure you get
41 Ayer s. There’s no risk to run with this old, reliable medicine.

Pagel, the brawny horse and lion lifter, has had another
disagreement with his noble beast. He had gone through
the usual performance of baring the docile one’s fangs
and claws, and was about to lift up the beast for the
final throw off, when it eluded his grasp and sprang at
him. But for the presence of the huge mastiff which
accompanies him, and which savagely attacked the lion,
things might have gone hard with the giant ; as it was,
he was badly mauled and lost much valuable foreign
gore.
A Westralian showman, charged with being the keeper
of an unregistered dog, set up the defence that, as the
dog performed nightly, it was not a dog but a tool of
trade.
Wirth Bros, give this information : The writer of
“ Poverty Point ’* par. on Australian circuses (16/5/’O3) is
a little astray on the early experiences of Wirths’.
Wirth, senior, was with Jones in the business 39 years
ago. In the seventies the family was successively with
time-honored shows like Stanthorpe’s, St. Leon’s, and
John Ridge’s Japanese Typhoon circus. They left
Ashton in 1880, and started an acrobatic show at Paddy’s
Market, Sydney. Two years later Ashton, who had
a first-class lot of performers, met the Wirths in opposi-
tion at Inverell, and Ashton went down. Perhaps this is
what last week’s writer refers to in saying that Wirth’s
ran a small acrobatic side-show in opposition to the late
Jimmy Ashton’s well-known circus. The Wirths never
in their lives earned a very precarious living as a
travelling brass band, as the writer states. They took a
trip to Noumea in the eighties, and in 1893 thev shipped
off the whole show for a tour round the world, playing
in South America, Europe, South Africa, and India, as
an Australian combination. After gathering reputation,
dollars, and experience, the brothers came home three
years ago, leaving two of their number behind in their
graves, viz., John at Aliwal, South Africa ; and Harry at
Hongkong.
Yvette Guilbert, at time of departure of last Paris
mail, was suffering from severe kidney trouble —a re-
crudescence of an old complaint which before necessitated
the removal of one of the kidneys.
“ Melb.” : Professor Baldwin Spencer’s limelight and
cinematograph lecture on the aboriginals continues to
please. He was nervous at first about his corroboree
scenes, genuine moving picturts, and used to announce
them as “for men only,” but ladies somehow arrived all
the same. I heard him in Oollingwood, a night or two
ago. Maybe he only expected men, but young women
predominated. Quite harmless it proved, although all
the crowd of darkies appeared to have nothing on, and
some had nothing to a dead certainty. Then there were
crowds of naked women in the moving pictures. A few
—the weeping widows—had plastered themselves, or
chalked themselves, all over, so that they looked like
Venuses in motion.
“Top 0 ” : The recent visit of English tenor Edward
Lloyd reminds me that he is the single tenor artist of
real eminence that England has produced since Sims
Reeves. It is now 30 years since Lloyd made his first
public appearance and then he was doubly eclipsed, first
by the supreme popularity of Sims Reeves, and next by
the splendid voice of Joseph Maas. Upon the premature
death of the latter, and the artistic decline of the former,
Lloyd shot to the front and has never since had a real
rival. Ben. Davies is thought by some to have a voice of
power and sweeter quality, but he has neither the range,
nor the artistic ability of Edward Lloyd. Among French
tenors, the best to-day are Jean de Reske and Albert
Alvarez. Ernest Van Dyck, the Fleming, runs them
closely. The only great German tenors are Kraus and
the popular Dresden artist, George Anthes. Neither of
those are of the first quality, however ; while Germany is
wonderfully strong in heavy basses she seems unable to
produce a really excellent tenor. Italy is the breeding
place for tenors. Lloyd, I believe, is an uncle of the New-
castle (N.S.W.) soprano, Miss Violet Ludlow (sister of Dr.
Ludlow, of Waverley) who is now touring the English
provinces with a concert co. of her own and with very
considerable success too.
A man who has travelled with them both asserts that
lately-dead lecturer Clark was the cheeriest, and Frank
Lincoln the worst-tempered, of all the one-man shows that
have struck the boards of the Commonwealth. Snazelle
was also an aggravating and embittered cuss.
There were two quaint old English names in Edward
Lloyd’s little co.—Miss Foxcroft and Mr. Peterkin.
Which suggests that this country rears a few children of
unknown parentage who might as well be furnished with
characteristic Australian names, such as Ferntree, Tail-
tree, Wombat, Drycreek, Wallaby, Bushtrack, &c., &c.
Much better than Jones. The imagination of an Aus-
tralian foundling’s godfather rarely rises above Jones or
Macsomething.
William Mower Akhurst was the best writer of Mel-
bourne Xmas pantomimes, and got for them £lOO apiece.
He was Herald sub-editor, in the palmy days of Michie,
Evans, and Aspinall. None of his pantos hit the mark so
well as “The House that Jack Built, or Harlequin Jack
Melbourne and Little Victoria.”
There is a concert-hall in Victoria so big that it takes
up part of two towns. The performers sing in one town,
and a great part of the audience sits in the other. This
is the Alfred Hall, Ballarat, which is built over the
Yarrowee, the “ river” that separates Ballarat from Bal-
larat East. Many years ago, when the Duke of Edinburgh
visited the Golden City, it went off its alleged head with
grovel, and in honor of the visitor the city determined to
build a hall. The city, however, would not have it built
in the East, and Ballarat E. would be d if the West
should have the “ honor,” so to meet the difficulty the
structure (a huge, unlovely barn) was built with'its head
in the East and its tail in the West.
Buzzi, remembered as the basso of the Simonsen
Italian Opera Co., has become a monk. After enjoying
himself in Melbourne 12 years he returned to his beloved
Italy, and has since entered the Carthusian establish-
ment at Rome.
