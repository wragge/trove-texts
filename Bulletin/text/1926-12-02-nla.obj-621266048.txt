70 years of
Pipe -making
THE experience of generations of pipe makers is em-
bodied in the latest GBD pipe. From among the
faultless briars which bear the GBD Brand, the
GBD at 12/6 is the best pipe value obtainable. To dis-
tinguish it from the standard range at 7/6, the pipe bears
a small GBD disc, inlaid in the mouthpiece.
The real point of difference however in addition to the
flush silver mount lies in the specially selected grains ;
year by year fewer of them are available.
Ask your tobacconist to show you a few and convince
yourself of the beauty of the briar. The quality which
dates from 1855 is unsurpassed.

The Red Page
Some American Painters
Provincetown, Mass., besides being a
literary centre, is also one of America’s
very flourishing art colonies. Charles W.
Hawthorne and George Elmer Brown, two
of the nation’s most noted painters, started
coming .here 30 years ago to paint. Both
are nowVacademicians and run large schools ;
their pupils also, become academicians,
winners of the Prix de Rome, or modernists
of every extremity of wildness. Very little
fishing is now left, the whalers and Grand
Bankers aa,e gone, the old piers are. washed
away to a few piles; but the white New*
England -cottages remain, the iridescence of
a seven-foot tide-drop over sandy bars
streaked with .green weed still recurs, the
long, smooth smnd-dunes on the ocean side
are always Saftaras of golden . sand. So
during the summer months paint bubbles
along the beaches, and hundreds of artists
stick up their easeis before the occasional
lumber-schooners* or*the pretty bronze Portu-
guese girls.
Hawtt jrne turps? his classes loose all day
on a merhead to paint the model as they
see it. Once a week he paints before the
classes as an objee-t-lesson. The painting is
a star performance watched with breathless
attention. When it is over the students
applaud. The masterly sketch is worth it,
and is raffled among the students at the
end of the season, a free donation from the
artist. Saturday- morning in the studio
lie criticises the week's work, carefully
appraising sometimes GOO canvases — which
are not canvas, but beaver-board. The
criticism is a terrific feat of memory, because
Hawthorne is affile to recollect his pupils’
progress from pasfc years and recognise their
work the moment; it is hung on the screen.
His main purpose!is to teach color, lie will
not tolerate any attempt to make pictures;
faces are mere splodges of orange in sunshine
or purple in shadow against various hues
of water or yellow sands; he rebukes any
attempt to drift to portraiture, or even to
indicate features. “You can learn to draw
in the winter,” he? says. “Give me the red
of that cheek againsst that blue, or the purple
of that shadow under that dory. I don’t
care whether it is drawn well or not.” The
result is that the student does learn color,
even if his amorphous blotches provoke the
scorn of the Philistine.
Hawthorne himself is known for his
portraits, his genre studies of fishermen and
women. All his portraits have individual-
ising character; he is especially successful
in getting a haunting Botticelli quality in
liis young girls, as exemplified by his
“Trousseau” in the Metropolitan Museum,
New York. The best testimony to his teach-
ing is the number of men and women he
has trained who are not imitators of him.
These include Ross Moffat, one of the most
individual painters here; Charles Kaeselau,
a depicter of wintry sea scenes ; Edwin Dick-
enson, a mystic of dark color octaves ; Fraser,
a water-colorist who has been praised and
purchased by John Sargent; Jerry Farns-
worth, a decorative figure-painter, and Helen
Sawyer, his wife, whose rhythmic landscapes
would tell any sensitive critic that her
brushes dance as they paint.
Kaeselau and Dickenson stay here all
winter. ICaeselau’s snowy beaches against
dark water betray his Viking ancestry. He
has been purchased by the Swedish Govern-
ment. Dickenson’s picture in this year’s
local exhibition has been criticised as an
anthracite complex. It is a large canvas of
an old man playing a ’cello surrounded by
a junk-heap of a piano, scattered books, tea-
kettles. The old man looks like a corpse
till one’s eyes open to the masterly draughts-
manship and the delicate gradations of color.
The El Greco influence is remarkable. You
have the sensation of seeing a remarkably-
patterned picture as it were through smoked
glasses.
Moffat is another winter resident. He
paints horses hauling lifeboats to wrecks,
anxious shawled women watching wintry
seas, breezy bow-legged fishermen tumbling
home through the crooked lanes. He is not
as sombre as Dickenson, nor as abstract;
his pictures are more pervaded with a tragic
human sense of the lives of those who drag
the deep waters. Moffat would be an ideal
illustrator .for Eugene O’Neill’s plays. On
asking him about his compositional methods,
he replied, “I just put down a line, and then
skirmish round.” George Elmer Brown's
method lays more stress on composition
and picture-making. He has been purchased
by the Luxembourg and decorated by the
French Government. Ambrose Webster is
a New England painter who has made a
specialty of painting sunlight. His Bermuda
and Spanish pictures are orgies in pure
color and broad drawing. His teaching is
more schematic than Hawthorne’s ; his pupils
are taught to reason by spectrum diagrams.
Since his last visit to France he has come
under the influence of and is going
in now more for form—-a natural sequence
to a method that at'bottom is impressionistic.
Very few of the young artists here to-day
are impressionistic. Monet is an old hat.
The cry is for form, pattern and tone-rela-
tionships. The extreme modernists are led by
Blanche Lazelle and Heinrich Pfeiffer. The
latter, originally a pupil of Webster, is now
an apostle of the dynamic symmetry of Ham-
bridge—a method of dividing up the pictorial
space according to mathematical principles
derived from the study of Greek vases. Felix
Mahoney, formerly a newspaper cartoonist
and now a brilliant water-colorist, who gives
his annual show at the Corcoran Art Gallery
in Washington, D.C., besides running an art
school in that city, is endeavoring to work
out Hambridge’s principles as applied to
color. Many of the extremists are thus
striving to get pictorial beauty by the
mathematical route, arguing * from the
analogy of the musical scale. Moffat, how-
ever, who spends his winter studying Ein-
stein, is too much of the pure artist to let
formula interfere with his “skirmishing
round.”
Blanche Lazelle’s queer patterns in various
flat colors were a jest till a big critic blew
in from Paris last summer and complimented
her on the beauty of her work. The writer was
one of the scoffers till he learned that her aim
was not to represent anything in particular,
but to give the sensation of three-dimensional
space by arousing in the optic nerve a feel-
ing of visual adjustment that such a space
would produce. Looking at one of her can-
vases in the local museum, its three-dimen-
sional quality suddenly flashed across me
in much the same way as one gets those
optical riddles in the psychology books. I
was a convert. These abstract studies) this
class of artist claims, give them the same
power to paint the actual solidity of nature
as pure mathematics give to the engineer
and physicist in their handling of crude
reality. Dorothy Loeb, of this school, pro-
duced a picture of a garage last year that was
a triumph in its ugly beauty. This school
scorns prettiness and sentimentality, though
sometimes ignoring the fact that they erect
formula into superstitions and substitute
erratic impulse for inspiration.
Besides these painters Provincetown harboi'3
a host of wood-block makers, illustrators,
etchers, pen and pencil workers. I lately
met Jack Musgrave, formerly of Geelong,
who went through the war with an English
regiment, the Bedfords. He is showing some
nice water-colors, drawn in charcoal and then
fixed, washed in with transparent color, and
then heightened with tempora.
The impression produced by this witch’s
cauldron of different men and women is that
the older men are resting on their oars
and the younger men don’t know where they
are rowing. Some of the former are ham-
pered by their very success. Richard Miller,
formerly of Saint Louis, and Paris-trained,
has been so successful with his young ladies
posing behind sunlit window-blinds that the
public will not let him paint anything else,
although his mural decorations and his land-
scapes are some of the ablest produced in
America.
MASS., TJ.S.A.
J. H. GREENE.
Simplicity
Although he was said to be six-feet-one, if
ever I meet the English hero of a recent
Australian novel I’m going to take a risk.
My only pugilistic qualification is that I was
knocked out in half a round in the one fight
I ever had; but I think I should have a
fair chance against a bushman whose muscles
ache for several days after he has dug a
grave two feet deep. Afterwards I shall
apologise for having hit the hero-creation of
a woman, and he will reply: “There are a
few women writers who can draw a man that
doesn’t altogether resemble a, milksop, but
the majority fashion them as, left alone, they
would rear them—namby-pamby effeminates
with less backbone than a boiled oyster.”
That I shall accept, adding only: “Yes, those
who attempt to draw men at all. You, for
instance, are not nearly so badly done by as
your countryman in this story of Pauline
Smith’s issued by Jonathan Cape. Certainly
her Englishman is intended to be a weakling,
but even were he a cot-ease he should seem
to live. And a potential father surely ought
to be more than a ghostly outline.” But
thereupon I shall throw my arms around the
literary neck of Miss Smith and thank her
for The Beadle despite the shadowy English-
man.
A few years ago Miss Smith wrote “The
Little Karoo,” and therein gave more than a
hint of the pure simplicity of theme, manner
and style which flows through “The Beadle”
with the crystal clearness of a mountain
spring, and which, coming to one surfeited
with the sentimental rubbish, crude strivings
for originality and glorifying of the sordid
so lavish in so-called “modern” novels, tastes
strangely of the sweetness of truth and
beauty. Here may not be all the qualities
of great prose, but certainly there are many
of the attributes of very good prose. There
is real simplicity, for one thing, and by that
I do not mean writing of this sort; “The
grasshopper was black. . . .They were all
black. They were not big grasshoppers with
yellow-and-black and red-and-black wings
whirring out from the black wing-sheath as
they, fly up. They were just ordinary hop-
pers, but all a 1 sooty black in color.” That
sort of irritating reiteration passes current
for simple prose among the “modernists.”
The passage, actually is from a United States
imitator of Knut Hamsun, and could be done
by ninety-nine children out of a hundred just
as badly. Its meaning, however, is clear —
they were black grasshoppers—-and for that
reason TJ.S.A. has something to crow over
Australia in respect of a home-made passage
which has been haunting me for a couple
of months: “Cinnabar! Symbol of blades
. .'. .Blade of Time. . . .blood of earth. . . .the
dim-cinnabar gorge. Blade of Man. . . .blood
of tree....the cinnabar slash. Dual blades
.... Steel-white sun... .steel-blue axe. . . .axe
and sun...-.” That (part of a description
of a gorge) I confess to liking; it describes
so clearly the end of a horse-race viewed
through five felt hats and a bowler.
I turn from these as hastily as I decently
may to Miss Smith’s valley of simplicity and
her true simplicity of prose, believing, after
Quiller-Couch, that the first virtue of prose
is to persuade, and to do it simply
In the Aangenaam Valley visits from the distant
Platkops doctor were almost, as rare as were the
visits of the pastor, and children were born into
the world, and men, women and children left it,
in such physical and spiritual comfort as could be
administered to them by those around them. On
the bigger farms every housewife had her own
supply of home-made “drops” and simples, not only
for the use of her own household, but for the relief
of any sick and poor who’ might appeal to her. And
because burial in the valley must follow so hard upon
the heels of death she had in; readiness also both her
shroud and her coffin and the shroud and the coffin of
her “man.” The poor could make no such preparation,
and here and there among them the older custom still
lingered, and in petticoats or shirts, bound about with
linen, their bodied went down into the earth into
caves cut deep in their graves and boarded up with
planks. For rich and poor alike the only bier was a
ladder, and round about the farm of Harmonie, and
for many miles beyond it, the dead were carried to
their graves under the folds of a black cashmere shawl,
heavily fringed, belonging to Mevrouw van der Merwe.
In that paragraph Miss Smith persuades
me that I am in her valley of simple souls,

and from it alone I know the bijwoner before
he steps on to the next page with his seif-
revealment: —
He himself had killed a chicken and cut open its
heart and placed the still-warm heart on the chest of
the child, but. God knows how it was, this cure had
brought no relief.
Aye, and God knows how the simpletons
of reiteration and jangling jargon would
mutilate that wonderful remedy for croup!
Pauline Smith, thank Heaven, spurns their
artificialities, and the valley in which An-
driua loves her Englishman and is left by
him to her memories and her shame is, in
consequence, a valley of truth. Her character
delineation apart from the unfortunate
botch of an Englishman—is uncommonly
good, but it is her atmosphere of the valley
whose people have no other literature than
the Bible, and that at second-hand because
few of them can read, which makes “The
Beadle” a welcome flower among the weeds
of neurotic, artificial and silly harvestings
of the publishers. Not many have drawn
a people so convincingly primitive as hers,
nor made, the drawing with such hidden
strokes. All the swains of the Aangenaam
are thrown on to the canvas through a side-
line of the postmistress. Juffrouw tie Neysen
writes for each his one love-letter, a declara-
tion of his love which he takes to her to
whom it is addressed and, if the suit fails,
brings back to Juffrouw that she may strike
out the maid’s name and substitute that of
another. The swain makes his selection
simply by considering that this one will bring
with her two sheep, and that one a sewing-
machine, and this an ox.
.Tan Beyers, because Andrina will bring
two oxen, has taken his letter to her, and
Andrina has come afterwards to her aunt: —
“Did he come to you with his letter, that young
man Jan Beyers?”
Against her shoulder Andrina nodded her head.
“Andrintje,” said Jacoba, “he is a good young man,
Jan Beyers.”
There was no movement in response to this.
She said again, as if eager to do him justice, “A
good bijwoner he is, and a good husband he will be.”
Andrina stood still as a stone by her side. Her
stillness, her silence, alarmed Jacoba.
“Tell me, my little one, was it not a nice letter that
he brought?” she whispered, and was answered;
“I did not take his letter.”
That is as simple as it is possible to be;
and among these simple people Miss Smith is
delightfully at home. It is because I rather
love her valley that I regret this unfortunate
woman is haunted. Still, I have a certain
amount of chivalry, and if she lets me know
next time a ghost comes haunting her and
insisting on being dragged into her writing
as a live Englishman I’ll go over to South
Africa and pose as a model.
CECIL MANN.
If
If we human beings had one more sense,
would art in any of its present-day forms
be necessary to us at all? Is art ever any-
thing more than a striving after what a
sixth sense would reveal to us? If we were
without the sense of sight, we could still
feel the life-giving heat of the sun, and might
in time deduce that there was a sun, also
that there were stars. But we could only
in the very vaguest way describe these de-
duced things. On the other hand, if we had
another sense we might know of things that
are to us as the sun and the stars would be
to us if we were blind. Always from their
effect upon other things we are striving to
deduce what these beyond-things are. There
is an instinct in us to define and reveal them.
Our desires turn and face them always, as the
blind flowers face the sun. It is this state or
the cause of it that is the artist’s quest. Has
the artist a developing sixth sense? Or is
it that the liyper-sensitiveness of his other
senses almost makes up for a sixth sense?
Robert Browning held that God took the
musician aside and whispered to him, and
that other men could “reason and welcome,”
but it was only the musician who knew.
Possibly Browning was right. Anyway,
musicians, and all other artists, seem able,
as we ordinary people cannot, to reach out
and clutch and hold fragments of that won-
derful something that seems so clusively to
envelop us all. There seems to be a skin
that divides us from this something. We
can only vaguely feel the shape of it through
this skin. The artist’s skin is evidently
more refined. He can feel round and about
the shape. But if we had a sixth sense that
could penetrate this skin, as our eyesight
penetrates the atmosphere around us, and
reveal to us in all detail what is beyond it,
then would there be any work for the artist
to do? Would art be necessary at all?
If we human beings are not all artists, we
have at least all got the art-instinct in us.
The Will to Express—the deepest of all the
wills-—motives us as it motives all things.
We are always instinctively seeking some
shape, some design. If we put down a
column of figures we strive towards an ideal
neatness. If we scratch the earth idly with
a stick, we seek after some design. If we
plant a garden round our house, in its neat-
ness or its wildness there is some of our
individuality. There is something within us
that all the time we are alive and awake
is urging us on to express—what? Some-
thing that has impressed us or is impressing
us.. This impressing thing comes like a
whisper to us, and there will be no rest for
us until this whisper has been passed on
to somebody or something. We must im-
press as we are impressed. We must express
what impresses us. And if we are not
artists and cannot express what impresses
us, then the art-urge that is the unexpressed
impression within us must be passed on. We
must have more perfect selves to do what
we cannot do.
Possibly ages, ago a hunter coming sud-
denly over a hilltop paused, spellbound by
the. magnificence of a sunset. That sunset
whispered to him of something beyond, grand,
beautiful, sublime. If he could reproduce
that sunset; if he could pick out and describe
to his fellow-men the significant truth of it,
then lie could reveal his deepest self by
expressing what had so impressed him. But
he could not do this. He had not the art-
faculty ; he was not an artist. But the art-
urge was awake in him. And it would never
sleep again until that sunset was expressed
by him or his descendants. He would pick
out the woman whom his instincts told him
possessed expressing qualities he lacked. His
son would probably be as he was, a man
with his father’s art-urge, but still no art-
faculty. But in time that art-urge must
find its blossoming. The artist descendant
must come. So thinkers, painters, poets,
sculptors, musicians, architects, engineers
come. They are all consciously doing what
their ancestors instinctively wanted to do.
They have developed at last the revealing
outlet. Thejy are expressing the impressive
—always deciphering the beyond.
Man can to a certain extent express him-
self by action. But action will never alto-
gether suffice. There comes a time to him
when Ms fleetness and strength no longer
count. The beasts of the field can express
themselves by action, too, but they cannot
express themselves by art. As man draws
further and further away from the beast, as
he becomes more the god, he becomes more
tlie artist. And every man’s instinctive aim
is the artist. All the fiercest longings within
him urge him towards his great art descend-
ant, for only through that descendant can
bis fellow-men know wliat lie instinctively
knows, what he feels. Only through this
descendant can he be fully expressed. Pos-
sibly this will explain, too, why the great
artist is such a poor parent. Where other
men have to seek .their expression beyond
their children and are wholly dependent for
that expression on those children, the artist
man finds liis expression in his art.
Tlie human race might be compared to a
garden. The aim of every plant in the gar-
den is the ideally-perfect flower. And tin:
aim of the garden is tlie gardener’s aim. He
urges on the flowers to their best efforts.
He, utterly invisible and beyond, prunes and
waters and weeds. He hurts them, kills
them if necessary. But he wills them to his
end as he in turn is willed. When the plants
blossom beautifully, then lie blossoms beau-
tifully; and whatever it is that wills him
blossoms beautifully too. If man ever de-
velops a sixth sense he will be as the plant
would be if it could develop another sense.
The plant would,see the gardener and under-
stand his ways. And man with his sixth
sense will come face to face with the vast
invisible, impalpable, unknown tliat lie now
calls God. He will understand. He will
see what all the arts are striving eternally
to show to man. He will see what through
myriads of generations has been the aim
of art and the aim of life.
ALAN D. MICKLE.
Things Are Different Now
lii Our Changing Morality, by Freda
Ivircliwey (Kegan, Paul, Trench), a sort of
symposium is given of the views of a number
of well-known writers on modern marriage,
the “virtue of women,” the sparsity of
female genius, modern love, modern fiction,
and a number of other delectable topics,
mostly sexual or verging thereupon. There
is much chaff, but also much wheat, in the
epitome.
Common-law marriage as recognised in
New York State consists in a meeting of the
minds —a contract. So if two people live
together as husband and wife it may be
evidence of a common-law marriage. But if
there has not been even a private agreement
of marriage their living together would be
unimportant. If they wished to separate
they would need no divorce, for they would
never have been married. Difficulty arises
when the parties do not agree as to whether
there was an agreement or not. Thus the
very indefiniteness of the tie adds difficulty
and publicity to the breaking of it. Arthur
Garfield Hayes objects to the formula “to
love, honor and obey” as being “unenforce-
able.” Yet there was a recent Texas case
in which a husband obtained an injunction
restraining his wife’s employer from flirting
with her.
In spite of the general belief that America
is tending towards polygamy, or even pro-
miscuity, Charlotte Perkins Gilman main-
tains that monogamy is the only healthy
sexual life for the normal man or woman,
and that ultimately it must triumph.
Humanity’s major error, she holds, was the
exploitation of the female by the male, a
step which has resulted in making woman
ultra-feminine and man ultra-masculine, to
the detriment of both of them. It is to
the advantage of the young to have the con-
tinned care of its parents, and monogamy
makes this easier than any other system.
Monogamy is also the popular ideal; even in
the “Arabian Nights” the love-story is always
about one man and one woman, never of the
mad passion for a harem. Happier marriage,
better children and a wide improvement in
public health make up the goal of the future.
It is to this end that all social morality
tends.
The intellectuals have destroyed the
humanistic conception of love. In “Man and
Superman” Shaw makes Tanner say that
if our love did not produce another human
being to serve the community the community
would have the sacred right to kill us off,
just as the hive kills off the drones who
do not attain the queen bee. Rut what does
that mean? It means that happiness is of
no importance. Surely this is absurd. The
child is justified because it adds to our
present delight and lives a life as valid as
our own. It is significant that Shaw and
the bulk of the intelligentsia are at one
with the R.C. Church, which has frequently
affirmed that sensual love is a guilty thing,
and has exhorted man to' multiply and
replenish the earth.
Isabel Leavenworth has no time for the
accepted standard of the virtuous woman.
The virtuous woman knows all about the
double standard of morality set for the two
sexes, accepts it as an “acknowledged part
of her background,” and keeps herself abso-
lutely separate from the tabooed class of
women on whose frailty her own virtue
rests secure. An elderly lady remarked:
“Do you know, I heard that a young man
of our set said he and his friends no longer
had to go to girls of another kind for their
enjoyment. They can get all they want from
girls of their own class !” This was the out-
rage—the confusing of classes ! The “purity”
of the virtuous woman is purchased at this
price. “The good woman sits serenely on
the structure upheld for her by prostitutes,
and occasionally even commits the absurdity
of trying to ‘reform’ these women, the neces-
sity for whose existence is implied by the
beliefs in which she herself lives.” Miss
Leavenworth strenuously advocates the aboli-
tion of this “double standard,” and believes
the secret of a higher morality lies with the
young people’s new attitude of camaraderie
and the co-operation of the two sexes. At
present it is because gaiety and morality are
divorced that gaiety becomes sordidness,
morality dreariness.
“Where are the female geniuses?” asks
Sylvia Kopald plaintively. “Women may
have minds”—every average man will now
grant that. “But,” he will ask, “have they
eyer much more than average minds?” Every
high peak in the historic landscape is mascu-
line. Point them out —Dante, Shakspeare,
Goethe, Virgil, Horace, Plato, Socrates, New-
ton, Darwin, Watt, Edison, Shelley, Keats,
Beethoven, Wagner, Bach, Tolstoi. The
truth appears to be that the male exhibits
a greater variability. The male is the agent
of variations ; the female is the agent of type-
conservation. Out of any given number the
males would show more idiots and inferiors
than the women, but would also show many
more able and highly talented individuals, and
also a number of geniuses—where the female
sex shows none.
A chapter on “Dominant Sexes” is not
convincing. The theory that roundness and
fulness of figure are necessarily characteristic
of women, while size and strength pertain to
men, is not always borne out by facts.
Different occupation accounts mostly for the
different build. The ruling sex, whether male
or female, puts domestic duties on the sub-
ordinate sex and takes to itself work outside
the home. In ancient Egypt at one time
women ruled. The Talmud tells us that the
Children of Israel were disturbed because
their men were forced to do women’s work
and their women men’s work. The daughters
in Egypt were compelled to support the
parents because the sons could not fulfil
that duty, as they had no income from their
labor because they stayed at home. In Lap-
land at one period men stayed at home and
minded the children while women fished and
sailed the sea. When woman ruled among
the Gauls the women were the larger and
stronger sex. The Spartan women in the
days of their rule were famous for their
enormous strength. As the present division
of labor between sexes ceases, there is an
increasing tendency for men and women to
grow alike in build and to dress alike. The
two sexes are not so widely different as male
vanity fondly imagines.
P. AIREY.
Novels Worth Reading
This list lias been compiled by a committee
nominated by the Associated Booksellers of
Australia and Maoriland. It is issued to
serve ns .a reliable guide to new fiction of
outstanding merit :
Books of Literary Merit. —The World of William
Clissold, by H. G. Wells; Under the Rose, by Anatole
France; The Casuarina Tree, by Somerset Maugham ;
Debits and Credits, by Rudyard Kipling ; The Emerald,
by Hilaire Belloc; Love in These Days, by Alex,
Waugh.
Books for Popular Reading. —The Exquisite Per-
dita, by E. Barrington; Pig Iron, by Charles G.
Norris; Shepherds, by Marie Conway Oemler; Un-
aeeountable Ann, by Douglas Walshe; The Wrong
Letter, by Walter S. Masterman; The Red Gods
Call, by C. E. Scoggins ; The Understanding Heart,
by Peter B. Kyne; Prodigals of Monte Cai'lo, by
E. P. Oppenheim; Sea Whispers, by W. W. Jacobs;
Torn Veils, by Rachael Swete Macnamara.
A Satchel of Books
Click of Triangle T., by Oscar J.
(Fisher Unwin). An exciting story of the Wild
West with its usual features.
Under the Northern Lights, by Alan Sullivan
(Dent). A volume of exceptionally interesting short
stories, the material drawn from the Hudson’s Bay
territory and further north. They have the atmo-
sphere that made Curwood’s story of “Kazan” so
popular.
The Pearl Lagoon, by Charles Nordhoff (Dent).
Boys and out-of-door girls will find this book full of
entertainment. The author has lived in the South
Seas and draws his pictures of the skipper, trader
and pearl diver as he has known him. A capital
holiday-book.
The Minister’s Daughter, by Hildur Dixelius
(Dent). The author is a Swedish novelist who holds
a high place in his country. The story is cast in
the year 1798, and apart from its dramatic qualities
is interesting as a picture of the life and manners
of that period. It is tense in dramatic quality
and almost without a trace of humor, but so incisive
in its style as to leave impressions difficult to efface.
The Ogre of Bandit Boost, by Harrison Conrad
(Fisher Unwin). “As she slipped from the bay’s
rump she grabbed the tail, and the horse kept on
with steady stroke straight toward the western shore,
the girl’s little figure washing in the split of the
blurring waves. ... She rolled to her back, her left
hand still clinging to the horse’s tail, and opened
fire on them”—and quite a lot more for your three
half-crowns.
Funny, by Ethel Turner (Ward, Lock). “ ‘And
now,’ said the lawyer, ‘nothing remains to be decided
but who will take the hoy V’ ” The Bishop, Car-
michael Thistlewaite, groaned, but as no one else
proffered to take over the burden left to his relatives
by the deceased penniless brother, he took the boy.
What it meant to the Bishop, his wife and bunch
of girls—for he nad no son —and what it meant to
Funny himself, is told by Mrs. Curlewis in her
pleasant, easy manner. But one can regret that for
the material she should have found it necessary to
go beyond her native land.
The Goose-feather Bed, by E. Temple Thurston
(Putnams). It is many years since the whimsical
charm of the “City of Beautiful Nonsense” delighted
its readers, but time has not given all that was
expected from its author. This latest novel is rough
carpentry compared with the artistic cabinet-work of
old days. The story turns on the adventures of
Chikka, a bareback circus rider, who becomes a
theatrical star, falls from favor, and on the eve of
her marriage to a fascinated torching, deserts him
for a circus lover with whom she swings back
to the sawdust ring. The characters are well
portrayed and there is no lack of color; yet the
book cannot rank with some of Mr. Thurston’s
earlier work.
♦
F. D. Davison in reply:—
A. G. Hales, in reply to my remark that Aus-
tralians can’t write (fiction), says that he thinks
that “Mr. F. D. Davison has very little to think
with.” Fortunately for my case thought is not
required. Without thinking I could name about
40 Australians who are writing poems, essays, para-
graphs, books of personal adventure, topical verse,
leaders and articles quite equal in quality to the
world’s best. But of names of writers of fiction of
some literary merit it is difficult to recall more
than one or two—even after the most violent cerebra-
tion.

Onoto, the Pen, has for years been the busy man’s pen. The
ease with which it fills and cleans itself, its readiness to write when-

Forgotten.
In an umveeded garden as I strayed
I found a little hidden marble shrine,
With ivy and rambling roses overlaid ;
And, like a mislaid cloak, a mass of vine
Covered the oaken bench. The little fount
Was dull and silent now;
No worshippers watched sliding incense
mount—
To some more potent god they paid their
vow.
“And yet,” thought I, “in a forgotten day,
’Twas love and toil that shaped this win-
some place,
Where leaping waters made melodious play.
See, the sharp arches carved with earnest
grace,
And, when I lift the living mantle, lo!
Where all was grey before,
The window throws a glad triumphant glow
To the marble nymph beyond the marble
floor!”
Her unveiled beauty gave no joy. The truth
With icy fingers touched my sickened
heart.
This was my fane, which, in the hopes of
youth,
I had rejoiced to fashion here apart.
These very hands had squared and set each
stone,
Planted the vivid grass,
And, in the eastward window, I alone
Had joined the thousand wonders of the
glass.
How glad the work, how daring and how
vain!
It has become the spoil of doubts and
fears—
The fears and doubts of age that still profane
What youth made holy with its smiles
and tears.
For youth, with easy faith, makes many
gods,
And hymns of many tones;
While songless atheist Age fears but the sods
That soon will greenly hide his mouldering
bones.

The Little Death.
Against my eyelids I can press
The tender velvet of the night;
She brings no pain with her caress—
The guerdon of the golden light
Is sorrow burning through the sweet,
When faith and disillusion meet.
Soft-sinking into cradling arms,
I close my eyes, forget the day,
The dull remorse, the sharp alarms,
The bitterness along my way.
My soul sinks back, bereft of dreams,
On to the breast of Lethe’s streams.
Here for a while I may find peace,
When sun and shadow both depart;
Here in the little death’s release
Forget my unforgetting heart—
A space in fields of asphodel
May cool feet that were scorched in Hell.

You ask me what is beauty,
And where does beauty stay.
Well, pulchrum in virtute
The Romans used to say,
And Truth and Faith and Duty
Are beauties in their way.
But if in all her rarest
You look for Beauty’s lair,
I know the place she’s fairest,
And I will tell you where:
Just take your mirror, dearest,
And you will find her there!
You ask me, dear, what grace is
Which oft the poet sings;
I only know its place is
Set high in many things;
That many forms and faces
Find healing ’neath its wings.
But if I must assign it
To one dear form alone,
I only can enshrine it
Upon its chosen throne,
And in these words define it:
“True grace is just your own!”
You ask me, dear, what Love is—•
That wonder of the world,
Now gentle as the dove is
With downy breast impearl’d,
Now fierce as Heaven above is,
With all its storms unfurl’d;
And I reply, half-liglitly,
But, oh, in earnest, too
(For though they sound so tritely
The words, dear heart, are true) :
“The way to learn love rightly
Is found in meeting you !”

After-glow..
A magic wrought of dying dreams,
A wizard light that creeps and glows,
Painting grey hills and sluggish streams
In tints of gold and rose;
Staining with fire the cherry-snow,
Lighting our hearts with sudden flame,
As if the love of long ago,
Back from its ashes came.
Rose-flushed and radiant everything!
And joy and hope are born anew;
Even the darting swallow’s wing
Has caught its glowing hue.
Ah ’ swift it dies from hill and plain....
Be wise, dear heart, and let me go;
Not Love that lit our hearts again— ’
Only its after-glow!

PETER LOUGHLIN AND HIS PARTY.
Thanks to the honesty and courage of three
country Laborites, the days of the mad
N.S.W. Lang Government are numbered. A
panic-stricken Premier has abandoned his
Budget and his price-fixing plans and
other one-eyed legislation, and undertaken to
go to the country as soon as the Electoral
Department is ready for the change-over
from multiple to single constituencies. By
bringing this position about, Messrs. Lough-
lin, Goodin and Gillies have rendered
N. S. Wales a service which N. S. Wales should
not forget. Their situation was—and is—ex-
ceptionally difficult. Loughlin is a Labor
Assemblyman of 10 years’ standing, whose
character and ability have so impressed his
colleagues that they chose him for the Lands
portfolio in three Cabinets, and named him
deputy-leader of the party. Gillies and
Goodin entered Parliament for the first time
in June last year. All three gave their con-
stituents pledges that they would promote
country interests. They were fated to see
those interests recklessly sacrificed to the
claims of city unions, and their party pass
under the control of persons like Willis,
Garden, Emil Voigt and Donald Grant,
“men alien to the spirit and sentiment of
Australia,” whose weak though blatant
instrument the Premier became. Yet seces-
sion to one of the other parties was out
of the question, nor could the trio resign
their seats without defeating their own cause
—it is one of the radical defects of propor-
tionalism that by-elections are barred.
Struggle against the Reds from inside the
party they could and did, until the day came
when the Premier went to the Labor Con-
ference saying “I did not come here to tell
you what' to do, but to ask you to tell me
what you want done and I will do it,” and
the Conference established “a dictatorship
of tl»e proletariat,” as Goodin suggests.
Then it was that Loughlin resigned from
L,.e Ministry, and with Gillies and Goodin
formed a Country Labor party with the
immediate purpose of forcing the Premier to
scrap the most deliriously foolish features of
his Budget and go to the country. They pre-
sented their ultimatum, and up went the
Premier’s hands.
* < * *
Very curious at this juncture was the
attitude of the leading Opposition news-
papers. So far from rejoicing at the pros-
pect of settling accounts with the Lang
crowd in March, 1927, instead of May, 1928,
and expressing at least a measure of respect
for the men to whom the early appeal to the
people is due, they were consumed with
anger because Loughlin and his associates
had not put a Bavin Ministry in office. The
Daily Telegraph dilated on “Mr. Lough-
lin’s weak-kneed vacillation.... his weak
man’s rdse of scuttling away and not sup-
porting his protests against the Lang dic-
tatorship by his vote” on the Opposition
leader’s no-confidence motion. And the S. M.
Herald asserted that “Mr. Loughlin will go
to the country discredited and distrusted by
both sides; he has discredited not only him-
self but his two followers.” “His courage
evaporated,” shrieked the Old Lady of
Hunter-street. “He turned out to be what
the small boy knows on the fifth of Novem-
ber as a squib.” The word “squib” might
be fairly applied, in a political sense, to a
Premier who jettisons his Budget in order to
hang on to office with humiliation for a few
miserable months. But a man who gives up
a Ministerial post worth £2OOO a year be-
cause his principles won’t let him retain it,
who tells the people that “a poisonous and
monstrous dictatorship” has been imposed
on the party he was returned to support and
asks them to pass judgment on it and him,
exerting himself at the same time to secure
the earliest possible hearing of the case —
that man is no “squib.” Indeed, considering
that bitter persecution has been the lot of
Labor members who have left their party in
the past, that the Louglilinites might have
sat back and enjoyed their salaries for an-
other 18 months as their faint-hearted sym-
pathisers elected to do, that they are not
rich men and have no fighting fund or safe
seats, the taunt of moral cowardice is un-
generous and unjust. Nor can it be logically
contended that they should have voted Bavin
into office. They would have been justified
in doing so only if there were no other means
of expediting the election ' which they
have made the first plank in their platform.
They found a way of expediting the election
without compromising themselves with
parties which they were elected to oppose;
and it was the right way, as far as they are
concerned.
* * # •
There are cynics who say still that the
Loughlinites won’t stick to their guns, but
The Bulletin prefers to believe that they
will. They have no right, of course, to
expect a grant of power without respon-
sibility, nor are they likely to get it. Many
electors otherwise well disposed will have
doubts about adding a new party or group
to thb three already in Parliament without
some guarantee that the new party will not
capriciously upset Government after Govern-
ment, should it be placed in a position to
do so. Support for the principle of elective
Ministries, with an undertaking to co-oper-
ate administratively with one or more of the
existing parties until the principle is
accepted by all, would, in most cases, remove
these doubts. If the Loughlinites are right
in thinking they represent an important sec-
tion of the people, that section should
assuredly have its Minister or Ministers, in
proportion to its voting strength in the
House. An elective Ministry in N. S. Wales
wrnuld be independent of those “outside
forces” against which Loughlin is striving.
It would be free from foreign influences, im-
pervious to the attacks of Communists, I
Won’t Works and all their venomous and
destructive tribe; moreover, it would afford
a living illustration of the falsity of the
class-war doctrine, which is doing Australia
so much harm. And in point of ability it
would be a very much better Ministry than
any one party could provide. There is
not much administrative talent in the pre-
sent N. S. Wales Parliament (or any other
State Legislature, for that matter) —cer-
tainly not enough to furnish two or three
first-class Cabinets. When the Stewart-
Dunstan group broke away from the Vie.
Cockies, it disarmed its critics by declaring
for elective Ministries. It is an example
that the Loughlinites should follow.
FACING THE DEBT.
It is about three years now since J. M.
Keynes, then in the heyday of his reputa-
tion as an authority on national finance,
attacked the credit of colonial Governments
and urged that their loan stock should no
longer be indiscriminately hall-marked as a
fit and proper investment for trust funds.
The part of Keynes’s indictment that stung
most was the remark that some colonial Gov-
ernments had already got into a position
where they had to borrow to pay interest.
Since then it has been the fashion for finan-
cial writers in the Big Smoke to say the
same unpleasant things twice or thrice a
year. The last occasion was a few weeks
ago, and Mr. Bruce, who was in London,
waxed righteously indignant and quoted
figures to show that if Isaac Bull had to
sell our pledges he would get his money back.
What has been skated over by those who
have handled Australia’s end of the argu-
ment is the fact that, taking the continent’s
much mixed and serried array of loans as a
whole, there is no adequate or systematic
preparation for repayment going on—unless
the substitution of one lOU for another can
be called a system. Now, that fact cannot
be perpetually ignored, and Dr. Earle Page,
well realising that fact, has suggested that
the Commonwealth and the States should
rally together, pool resources, and set up a
combined sinking fund calculated to wipe out
all indebtedness now incurred within a fixed
term of years. He suggested that the Com-
monwealth should continue, as at present, to
lay aside annually A per cent, sinking fund
on the national debt —excluding from con-
sideration the war debt to Britain which
is the subject of a special arrangement—
and that the States also, in proportion to
their population, should contribute to a sink-
ing fund in respect of their debts* that in
the next five years would amount to about
50 millions—a very respectable set-off
against the 320 millions of debt that matures
during the period.
*** f *
There can be no doubt, as Earle Page
remarks, that such a step would, consider-
ably improve Australian credit, and the im-
provement would surely be reflected, in better
terms for future loans, including the inevit-
able heavy renewals. And there! is a way
in which the thing could be done without
increasing very materially the difficulties of
Treasurers. At present the Commonwealth,
though without any obligation to do so, pays
the States a capitation subsidy that was ori-
ginally intended to compensate them for the
loss of Customs revenue. The amount of
these subsidies in the latest financial year
of which details are available was
£7,600,000. Something less than half that
amount would provide a sinking fund for
the States’ debts. An arrangement highly
favorable to the States might therefore be
made on the basis that the Commonwealth
should cease paying the capitation subsidy,
but, as a set-off, should relinquish collect-
tion from the States of bund tax, estate
duties and entertainment tax,- —this to avoid
the old controversy about income-tax—at
the same time undertaking responsibility for
all State sinking-fund contributions. The
arrangement would have worked out as fol-
lows if adopted in the last financial year
of which details are available:—

Comparing the totals with the capitation sub-
sidies for the various States in the year
1924-25, there is an advantage to the Com-
monwealth of £46,000 i‘n the case of N. S.
Wales, of £432,000 in the case of Victoria,
of £226,000 in the cepe of Queensland, of
£34,000 in the case of Westralia, and of
£82,000 in the case jof Tasmania. South
Australia, on the other hand, benefits to the
extent of £38,000.
* * * *
Probably no plan can be produced which
will work out quite evenly over the whole
of the States. The advantage of any such
scheme as that suggested is that, if it is
adopted, something will actually be done
and not. merely tallied about; and, from the
States’ point of view, they will be large
gainers, even the worst-placed of them,
from the fact tha/t they will get something
very substantial and something permanent in
return for foregoing the temporary and unde-
pendable pet' capita, subsidy. That subsidy
conies to them now quite as a matter of
grace. It is within the rights of the Com-
monwealth to fjrop it at any time. Thus
what such a scheme as that outlined would
do for them that the Common-
wealth would accept it —is to eventually
repay their debts out of voluntary contri-
butions made ]fcy the Federal authority ; and,
if some of thema seem to be getting a rather
larger advantage than others, it will at least
be noted that those who seem to be making
the greatest sacrifice are those which are the
best able to make it, being least in debt
per head. These latter are deeply interested
in the provision of a sinking fund for the
most heavily indebted, since nothing is surer
than that anything in the way of repudia-
tion or failure to promptly pay interest or
due principal on the part of one would make
things very expensive for all the others.
A TALE OF LOST MILLIONS.
This is the orthodox Australian romance of
the great long-mislaid, long-winded, long-
unclaimed fortune. It is written by a man
—myseMi—who never had an unclaimed
fortune* never expects to have one, cares
very little if he doesn’t have it, and would
probably make a bad use of it if he got it.
Still, J like to view the matter from out-
side. I have thus become acquainted
with the unclaimed heirs to two dor-
mant' peerages and a dormant brewery,
and I have met the missing heirs
of three estates, one of which doesn t
exist, while the other two are held by the
rightful owners and their children.
I t was as likely to have been March 7,1830,
as any other day when Patrick Burgess
left his native village of Banshee-on-Suir
on. the first'stage of his journey to the United
States. The adventurer was young, strong, full
of hope, and born to poor but insurrectionary
parents. He wore brogues and a caubeen. The
fiimes were bad, and the roads were worse,
and the weather was inferior to both of
them put together.
A comfortless ship, which was no speed-
hog, and the effluxion of time, which went
on then much as it does now, deposited
young Burgess at New York. It was in
those days a town about the size of Adelaide,
the streets being paved with cobble-stones
or plain earth, and the sidewalks made of
chance materials. The place hadn’t a tram-
car or a skyscraper or a cocktail or a statue
of Liberty to its name, and it hadn’t yet
invented Fenians, though it did later; but
Tammany was already in existence.
What the Exile of Erin did in New
York and how long he dwelt there are un-
known. It may be added that most things
about him are unknown and most ot the
others are disputed. His stay in New Tor
is really pure conjecture, but he must have
been somewhere. In a subsequent year, or
possiblv in the same year, but it was unlikely
to have been in a previous year, he moved
westward and ultimately brought up in
Chicago. That outpost became his home,
and there he accumulated the superb tor-
tune of £37,000,000, which he devised, in
strict accordance with the rules of the game,
to humble but sincere relatives m Australia
—the recognised home of the people who have
a lot of money coming to them from abroad.
Young Burgess made the journey either
right off or by instalments. How he fared in
those almost roadless regions, and what
vehicles he employed, if any, are matters of
conjecture. Nothing can be gathered from
his early correspondence, which doesn t exist,
nor his late correspondence, which doesn t
exist either. Owing to the obstacle of Niagara,
which is difficult to negotiate on the up-grade,
he almost certainly avoided the sea-and-nver
route. The best biographical authorities are
assured that no hostile Indians scalped him
on the way. Unless they also killed him and
concealed the body (a deed of which they
were and still are quite capable), his appear-
ance without any hair must have been heard
of by somebody.
New York was a one-horse place when
Patrick Burgess viewed it about 1830, but
Chicago was miles below the humble Gotham
level. It was smaller than Parkes_(N.S.W.),
and difficulty was experienced in keeping
buffaloes and wild Indians off the main
streets and bears out of the drinking saloons.
It remained poor right up to the immigrant’s
death in 1800. That is to say, it was mostly
of two storeys or less, mostly built of wood,
including the pavements, wherefore it went
up in smoke, like Elijah’s chariot, during
the fire of 1871, and had to be rebuilt.
The State of Illinois is not a gold country,
and in the back-number days of which I
write there were no oil-wells. The great
wheat and meat export trades had barely
started (the Union stockyards at Chicago
weren’t even built), railways were scarce
and manufactures in their infancy.
Into the affairs of this town the size of
Parkes, which he lived to see attain to half
the size of Dublin, the immigrant Irishman
must have thrown himself with the intense
energy of his race —one which has always
been distinguished for inventive, commercial
and manufacturing genius, for economy,
reticence, avoidance of whisky and politics
and abstention from religious controversy. In
no other way can be explained the immense
riches which he bequeathed to deserving
relatives in Australia, and which are now,
after an interval of 60 years, on the point of
being collected. The nature of his business
is not very clear, and the badly-printed
papers of the period throw no light on it.
But it was certainly a large concern. Judg-
ing by the funds which it represented it
should have been towards the culmination
almost as large as all the banks of Australia
put together. That is, measuring by the
capital and reserves employed. It is stag-
gering to contemplate the effect these institu-
tions and their branches would create if
consolidated in a two-storeyed wooden town
where there was little, if anything, to blow
out the view. At the middle of his career,
when the population of Chicago still counted
only 12,000, he probably was as wealthy as
a roomful of contemporary millionaires, con-
sidering how millionaires went then. Yet
the life of this exile of Erin was so unobtru-
sive that it has been impossible so far to fix
the date of his marriage with Agnes Cor-
nelia O’More, or to show that he ever mar-
ried her, or that they ever met, or that she
ever existed, or that he ever existed, or that
they both existed simultaneously, or even
that one of them existed simultaneously.
The last days of the Irish Immigrant were
.possibly clouded by the Civil War, and the
suspension of gold payments, and the depre-
ciation of the paper dollar, which went down
to Is. per lb. The cause of his death is un-
known ; but theories have been advanced re
the winding up of the estate. The most
feasible is that, when the employees came
back in the four-wheeled cab or growler from
the funeral, they held a meeting and con-
sidered the situation. It was ultimately de-
cided that everything should be realised upon,
and that the night-watchman and the office-
boy should take the proceeds round in a
bag and deposit them in the savings bank, a
“frame” building at the corner. There they
were saved by the Guiding Hand of Provi-
dence from destruction in the great fires of
1871 and 1574. By singular ill-fortune the
bag was mislaid, and it was only within the
last few months that someone came across
it and the heirs were notified.
The unclaimed fortune has been a favor-
ite subject with writers of fiction. One
of them came to Dorrit, senior, in
Dickens’s “Little Dorrit,” and was promptly
stolen by Merdle, who perished in a Turk-
ish bath. Another was located by Horatio
Paget, a picturesque scamp whom Miss
Braddon created, and he married his
daughter to the heir before breaking the
news. The complications led to the villain
of the tale attempting to poison his step-
daughter, after which he was frozen to death
while waiting to do another murder. A
multitude of instances might be quoted, but
this short narrative has the unusual quality
that it attempts to explain how and where
the fortune was made, and fully explains
how it came to be lost, and where it existed
in the interval.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Imperial Conference.
“ ‘l’m afraid I can’t understand it,’ said Alice.
“ ‘lt’s easier if you sing it,’ replied the Mad
Hatter mournfully. ‘lt could be made to go like
this: —
We are one and many,
We are tied and free.
Each is good as any
And we’ll never disagree.
You could sing it to the tune of “We Won’t Go
Home Till Morning,” ’ he added, brightening.”
When 1 “overseas” Premiers start talking
about Imperial relationships and passing
resolutions on the subject, it usually takes
the world’s leading authorities on inter-
national law at least six years to find out


precisely what was done, in a legal sense.
And about the only thing the average lay-
man takes out of the decision of the eminent
jurists when it is all promulgated and formu-
lated and laid down is a comforting feeling
that at least Scotland stands where it did.
Like the Oracle of Delphi and the Revelation
of St. John the Divine, these Imperial resolu-
tions are apt to offer something to every-
body. Mr. Lang, for instance, is encouraged
by the latest deliverance to go on believing
that Admiral de Chair’s daily programme
ought to be arranged by the A.L.P. Execu-
tive, or the Caucus, or by Mr. Garden.
S. M. Bruce, who has been orating ecstati-
cally, if a trifle hazily, about the beauties of
the formula he has got Hertzog and Mac-
kenzie King to accept, probably thinks that
in future the Ma State’s Admiral and the
other State Governors will have to turn to
a BnucE-advised Stonehaven for riding
orders. Diplomacy and Defence, legislation
affecting more than one unit of Empire, and
any other matter on which some agreement
is necessary between units if they are to act
in concert, are to be handled by “flexible
machinery,” “special sub-conferences” and
“personal representatives in London.” But
that won’t alter the incidence of ultimate re-
sponsibility. The last time a big emergency
confronted the British nation, the units were
driven to act in more or less accord by a
common danger. Under the stress of that
peril, constitutional principles, including, to
a seldom-realised extent, the principle of
representative government, were suspended.
The Empire fell under the direct personal
control of a very few men. Civil laws —even
the international conventions that regulate
the usages of warfare —disappear in the
turmoil of a big war, and peace-time decisions
which amount to the members of a group of
nations saying that they will co-operate so
long as they feel like it, and even so will
never imperil the common cause, won’t worry
anybody very much. The essential thing
about an Empire that differentiates it from
coteries of separate nations bound together
by treaties is that it has one nominal head
at all times, and submits to actual single,
central rule if attacked. Once that tradition
is laid aside, there isn’t any Empire left.
If the fact were realised there would be
fewer Imperial Conferences and less pompous,
windy talk about Imperial relations. An
Empire, in the last resort, is a collection of
populations that feel they are likely to hang
singly unless they hang together. To discuss
the terms on which such populations will
hang together is almost always a waste of
breath.

White Elephants in the Interior.
The Federal railway report was lately
issued, and, as usual, certain newspaper com-
ments emphasise the point that the Port
Augusta-Oodnadatta line (the south end of
the unfinished South-to-North railway) is
“the most hopeless white elephant” in the
herd. Incidentally, some elephants are born
white, and some are surreptitiously painted
white for various kinds of motives. This
may be a case of painted pachyderm. The
rather laggard “Statistics of Transport and
Communication” say that in 1924 the money
invested in the Commonwealth’s Desert rail-
way to Kalgoorlie was £7,379,785, and the
interest charged up was £103,397, which
seems like £1 Bs. per cent. The capital
invested in the Port Augusta-Oodnadatta
work is set down at £2,342,490, and the
interest mentioned is £78,939. That re-
sembles £3 7s. per cent. The interest
charged against the northern section of the
South-to-North line (Darwin-Katherine) is
at the rate of £3 Is. per cent. The interest
charged against the line to Kalgoorlie went
down from £217,180 in 1919 to £103,397 in
1924, a drop of £113,783. The interest
debited against the Port Augusta-Oodna-
datta work went down in the same period
from £79,659 to £78,939, a drop of only
£720. If the interest bill of the Port
Augusta-Oodnadatta (South-to-North) con-
cern had been written down on the same
generous scale, it would be possible to declare
that, mere dead-end though it may be, it
is a promising investment and may develop
into the flower of the Federal flock. Of course
there is no difficulty in imagining a techni-
cally honest explanation of it all. If any
large amount of the debt redemptions made
out of Federal surpluses went to reduce the
loans on the Kalgoorlie pet line, then there
is much less interest for the Kalgoorlie line
to pay, just as, in similar conditions, there
might be no interest at all for the Oodna-
datta route to pay. But it is another thing
to find an honest explanation for the con-
stant attempt made in some quarters to dis-
credit the South-to-North railway under
false pretences in the interests of a Federal
line through Western Queensland where the
great drought was. Another matter which
helps to make the comparative figures lean
over like the Tower of Pisa is that in some
years the amount charged for the mainten-
ance of 1051 miles of the Kalgoorlie track
is actually less than for 478 miles on the
Oodnadatta route. The former is new and
its heavy repair bills haven’t begun to come
in yet. Unfortunately nothing stays new.
Bruce Waiting on Baldwin.
Because of its climate, scenery, wealth of
native talent and great home market, to-
gether with the assurance of a generous
reception in the British market, Australia
ought to be producing moving-pictures on a
large scale. But before it can do so the
Australian Government must extend the
Protective principle to films —must abandon
the farcical revenue tariff of lid. a foot,
which amounts to a mere £4O or £SO on a
ready-for-exhibition copy of a Hollywood
product that has had the run of the Ameri-
can market (the article being, in effect,
dumped here), and substitute a Protective
duty of 6d. a foot at least, though Is. would
be better. Many times during the last five
or six years The Bulletin has urged this
course on the Australian Parliament; and
on two occasions there has been a majority
in one branch of the Legislature for a duty
of 3d. But shrill cries were immediately
raised by American exploiters, by Australian
cos. which not only import millions of feet
of Hollywood stuff but control chains of
cinema theatres, by small-fry producers
dependent on these theatre combines and by
union officials of the Little Australian
breed; and the politicians yielded. A com-
mittee of the Imperial Conference has been
considering ways and means of assisting
British and British Dominion picture-
makers to rid the Empire of the Hollywood
blight, to the extent that it is a blight. The
committee has issued a report containing a
number of recommendations, and The Bul-
letin notes with satisfaction that Protec-
tion heads the list. Other measures sug-
gested are Empire preference, which already
exists in a small way as between Britain and
Australia; “the requirement of a minimum
quota of Empire productions”—Victoria is
moving in this direction, and N. S. Wales
may follow suit—and laws for the preven-
tion of “block” booking, a practice which
should certainly be smitten with the legis-
lative axe. These proposals would stimu-
late Australian production, even if Aus-
tralia adopted them without waiting for other
parts of the Empire to move. They are
calculated to take the lead out of the dice
with which Hollywood has been playing the
game since 1914. Curiously enough, the
Australian Prime Minister says he is “dis-
appointed” with them for some unexplained
reason —perhaps because he has no real
enthusiasm for film production, or because
the British Government didn’t think to offer
him a moving-picture loan. The gentleman has
nevertheless promised that Australia will
“co-operate,” if “Great Britain gives us a
lead.” But why should Australia lag behind
the Old Man? Britain has a poor climate
for picture-production—one of the worst in
the world. Australia is so immeasurably
superior in this respect and others that
influential Britons who are interesting them-
selves in film production, independently and
in association with good Australians like Vic.
Senator Guthrie, are planning to get a great
part of their output made in the Common-
wealth, provided, the Commonwealth Govern-
ment rises to the occasion. There are signs
that Hollywood is beginning to be alarmed
at the prospect of this coalition of British
and Australian capital, brains and beauty,
which should be assisted in every legitimate
way. In effect, Australia is so situated that
it will gain more than Britain is likely to .f
film production within the Empire becomes a
big thing. So let Bruce give Baldwin a lead.

Where Does South Africa Stand?
Two prominent citizens of the Empire, Pre-
mier Lang, of N. S. Wales, and Prime
Minister Hertzog, of South Africa, have
shown a disposition to be suddenly converted
to ideals hitherto scouted. Lang’s conver-
sion was due to the instinct for self-preser-
vation ; Hertzog’s motive is less apparent.
In neither instance does the change of heart
impress as being deep-seated. But, whereas
Lang’s undertaking to consult the electors
of N. S. Wales affects that State chiefly and
its sisters of the Commonwealth in a lesser
degree, Hertzog’s adoption of Dominion
status as laid down at the recent Imperial
Conference may have far-reaching effects for
the Empire as a whole. For Hertzog is
much more than leader of a political party.
He is the head of a racial movement which
he himself re-organised and revived when
it was being allowed by bigger men to slip
into the forgotten. The creation of the Dutch-
National party and its entry into South
African politics was due to him. One of the
principal planks of the party platform lays
down the independence of South _ Africa,
as the main objective. Not indepen-
dence within the Empire but a conversion
into one Republic of the Transvaal, Orange
Free State and other members of the Union,
the Afrikander of British stock to become
an alien or to renounce allegiance to Bri-
tain. Hertzog and liis following have broad-
casted this objective for years. It inspired
the rising of Delarey, Beyers and De Wet
in 1914, on which occasion Hertzog bitterly
opposed Botha’s use of Union troops to
crush the insurgents and conquer German
South-West Africa. Nationalist sentiment
was openly behind the “Red” rebellion at
Johannesburg in 1922, and it was only
Smuts’s lightning action that kept some at
least of the Transvaal veld commandoes
from rising in sympathy, while Hertzog was
loudest in criticism of the Government’s mea-
sures of repression. These manifestations
had long led him to break with the Botiia-
Smuts party, with its determination to stand
by the Treaty of Vereeniging. When Labor
won the balance of power at the last general
election, he organised a pact with it to form
his present Government. Labor being largely
pro-British in S’Africa, a clause of the pact
guaranteed that the Nationalists would not
raise the question of secession from the
Empire during the life of the Parliament then
and still existing. Nevertheless, Hertzog
himself, the Nationalist press and the
Nationalist members of the Government —
notably De Roos, a typical Afrikander of
the new Nationalist school—have harped on
secession “when the chance comes.” Hert-
zog himself has grown warier. The savagely-
debated question of the new South African
flag has shown that the feeling of S’African
Labor has turned against him on that ques-
tion. In his farewell speech before leaving
for the Conference he voiced the doctrine
which he has recently substituted for his old
slogan of “Secession when the chance offers.”
The doctrine demanded a definite statement
of Dominion status as regards the Empire,
plus a formal intimation to outside nations
that the Dominions were entirely indepen-
dent, and were to be regarded as such by
outsiders. Such a declaration would have
paved the way to the secession for which
llertzog’s militant followers continually do
cry, and nothing less was to be accepted. Yet
the close of the Conference has seen the
S’African Prime Minister applaud a defini-
tion of status differing in no particular from
that which Imperialists have accepted for
years. Hertzog says it is all he desired.
But while the S’African Nationalist has every
reason to be well satisfied with his position,
he will certainly not be satisfied with this
unexpected complaisance, which Hertzog
will have to account for on his return. The
cause of the change is not far to §eek. Hert-
zog’s Labor support is becoming more luke-
warm every day, and it must be placated,
even at the cost of irritating the intransi-
geants of his own party, till his term of office
is up. Then, with a re-arranged franchise
and a redistribution of electorates, he may
be able to snap his fingers at any political
alliance. Yet Hertzog has here a splendid
chance to prove himself the Empire states-
man he has just alleged himself to be. The
opportunity has already been pointed out to
him by Janie Smuts, Dutch leader of the
loyalist party. It lies in persuading
his Nationalist supporters to strike out from
the party’s constitution the notorious clause
naming secession from the Empire as the
chief objective. If he will do that, and dis-
sociate himself from the young firebrands
who will continue to uphold it, he will have
gone far to command a confidence from every
section of the Union which he is at present
a long way from possessing.
“The Serum-monger’s Trade.”
“L.C.M.”: Helena MacDougall’s letter
(B. 11/11/’26) reminds me that the Devil
can be expert at quoting Scripture for his
own ends. It is an extrepiely ingenious
compilation of distorted and half-digested
facts. Certainly, in the prevention of diph-
theria sanitation is helpful. But it is not
sufficient; for, as the Melbourne secretary
of the Anti-Vivisection Society tells me
twice, diphtheria is still alarmingly preva-
lent —in my opinion because bacteriological
measures have only in rare cases, been
applied. On the subject of the “Schick” test,
I must beg leave to doubt my friend’s autho-
rities or her interpretation of them, for the
British Medical Journal (25/9/’26)
describes and recommends the test, quoting
such evidence as this: —
In New York City for the ten years preceding the
introduction of Schick testing and immunisation, the
average number of deaths from diphtheria was 1337.
Since 1919, when modern methods were first intro-
duced on a large scale, the number has fallen to
663. Similarly in Chicago there has been a fall
from an average of 797 to 239 deaths. In 23
American cities the death rate from diphtheria has
fallen an average of 10.3 per cent, per annum.
If the Schick test has been rejected for
London children the probable reason is the
difficulty of obtaining the consent of igno-
rant parents. It is sufficiently accurate Un-
practical purposes to credit the germ theory
and Lister with the introduction, not of
cleanliness into hospitals, but of antisepsis,
and later of asepsis into surgery. The point
is that, thanks to bacteriology, the germs
that caused the shocking mortality rate of
surgery in the ’fifties have been practically
eliminated by the faultlessly aseptic ritual
of modern operating-theatres. Koch’s pos-
tulates are certainly fulfilled for tuberculosis,
anthrax, syphilis, plague, tetanus and many
other diseases. That means that, in each
case, the identity of the casual organism
is completely established. I wonder if the
anti-vivisectionists’ secretary, who doubts
this, could be persuaded to eat her words
and swallow a live culture of diphtheria or
of typhoid bacilli! “The same germs,” says
she innocently, “are on the healthy and
the sick.” I wonder who was unkind enough
to tell her that a healthy person (such as
she or I) harbors such horrors as the bacilli
of tuberculosis, tetanus, plague, anthrax and
cholera, to say nothing of the spirochaetes
of syphilis and yaws? For these unpleasant
germs are certainly “on the sick” (though
providentially they are not all on all the
sick), and I should hate to think that any
one of them was either on or in Helena
MacDougall or myself. What she has been
told is that the “pyogenic cocci,” the causes
of pneumonia, septicaemia and of inflamma-
tion and suppuration of all kinds, are pre-
sent in the mouths and throats of the
healthy, where they lie low and wait their
chance of causing a gumboil or double-pneu-
monia as the case may be. The “specific”
germ is not turned at will into another germ.
The “virulent germ” does not perform the
surprising gyrations she describes. “Put
into the blood” it does “sometimes stay
there, sometimes not,” according to. its
nature and the susceptibility of the animal.
If it stays there it causes disease or death,
for the normal blood contains no live germs.
Put into the “unhappy animals,” it conveys
the disease expected, unless there is an
experimental error. The words of Professor
Wood Jones —“that there is a tendency in
modern medicine to rely too far upon the
abundant tests that may be applied”—were
part of a warning to inexperienced students,
not an attack on scientific medicine. Like
any other sensible person, the Professor
would protect himself from diphtheria and
tetanus by antitoxins, from typhoid by
inoculation, from small-pox by vaccination —
and from all forms of reactionary sentimen-
talism by commonsense.
Victorian Railway Finance.
“Clerk” : A private company which made a
practice of issuing rotten balance-sheets
wouldn’t last long these days, but the Vic-
torian Railways haven’t presented a decent
statement of accounts for years and until
adequate provision is made for depreciation
they never will. No one is more alive to
this than Chief Commissioner Clapp, and
when he recently touched the Government
for increased freights and fares he mentioned
£450,000 which he proposed to set aside ex-
clusively for depreciation. This the Allan-
cocktails refused to provide, so Brennan,
the venerable Chief Accountant, has returned
wearily to the old unsatisfactory method
of juggling the figures. This method is simply
to include the original cost of any condemned
truck, carriage, equipment or other asset in
the working-expense charges for the year in
which that asset is condemned or replaced.
Most railway property—rolling stock especi-
ally—has a limited life, and, in the absence
of the necessary replacement fund, the de-
partmental finances are naturally exhibiting
misleading working expenses bloated by the
writing-off of retired assets. At the present
moment Clapp has an ambitious programme
ahead of him. More nowerful locomotives
and bigger trucks are to be constructed, track
strengthening is necessary to meet this
heavier stock, and automatic couplers are
being installed. He not unreasonably pro-
tests that a large proportion of the cash
which he must find for this programme
should not be charged against present-day
operations, because it represents the value
of the capital lost in past years in earning
the revenue of those years. If what Clapp
wants done now had been done then, an
amount roughly equivalent to the lost value
would have been regularly paid to the credit
of the capital account or held in a fund to
write off the cost of the assets which must
now be retired. As it is, the short-sighted
railway policy of the past has left a very
big burden for present-day administrators.
Presumably they are expected to hoard up
and pass on a bigger one for the future
generation. Which is a typical Australian
arrangement.
Closer Settlement in Queensland.
“Bourri” : The question has been raised by
various contributors whether the closer-settle-
ment policy in Queensland is achieving or
defeating its object. From 1926 to 1931
inclusive, 30 million acres, comprising 501
pastoral holdings, will come up for subdivi-
sion, and the Government intends to cut
these into selections of from 10,000 acres
upwards, size depending upon the nearness
or otherwise of railways. “Kaloola” re-
cently (B. 9/9/’26) quoted figures to show
that dearth of rain, and not overstocking, is
responsible for the parlous condition of
Central Queensland. In 1892, he .said,
there were 21,708,310 sheep in the
State, and the runs were big, badly
watered and ill-subdivided. In 1913,
the pre-war year, the State eclipsed
by 80,000 the 1892 total, and in 1914 reached
the greatest number yet, 23,129,919. Now,
obviously, under a well-conceived settlement
policy, the subdivision of huge rambling
estates should result in increased flocks. But
has it? Closer settlement may be said to
have really started in Queensland with the
passing of the 1900 Act. Later followed
the 1910 Act, and a greater activity in
surveying and subdividing. From ’O6 to
TO flocks increased by two millions a
year—a thing which has never happened
since over an equal length of time. The
yeai s 1911 and 1912 saw many new families
starting, and the results were seen in the
figures for 1913 and 1914. It must also be
remembered that the selections—never hav-
ing been stocked to anything like capacity
as parts of the big runs —were almost virgin
country, and the areas were defined by a
Government with fairly liberal views. Labor
came into power in 1914, and incorporated
its ideas as to living areas in the 1915 Act.
Since then the numbers of our flocks —ex-
cepting for drought depletion—have been
practically stationary. The 1915 drought
cost us eight million sheep, the total receding
to 15 millions, and it stayed at that through-
out 1916. The following year brought it up
to 17 millions, and 1918 to 18 millions. In
1919, the drought—which didn’t by any
means embrace the whole State, and lasted
only six months where I was chopping
mulga—cost us a cold million. From 1920 —
a flood season —onward the seasons to the end
of 1925 could be reckoned from good to fair.
Certaihly there were no serious droughts in
the sheep areas. Yet the numbers in 1920
were only 17 millions, in ’2l 18 millions and
in ’22 17 millions again. By 1923 —which
wasn’t a bad season by any means—we were
back to 16 millions again. Climbing by slow
degrees we reached 18 millions in 1924, and
19 millions in 1925. If, under the old hap-
hazard system, and on the old ill-improved
runs, we could carry 18 to 21 million sheep,
then it is surely fair to contend that with
three or four places to-day where there was
before but one—and only a semi-stocked
one at that —we should, droughts notwith-
standing (they had those before 1900), be
carrying at least 30 millions to-day. That is,
we should be doing so' if our closer-settle-
ment policy is worth anything at all. That
we are back where we started from suggests
that there is something radically wrong with
the policy or its administration. Perhaps it
is the open ballot, giving the country into
the hands of the ignoramus and the specu-
lator ; perhaps it is deterioration of pastures
caused by overstocking on small areas ; per-
haps it is that those areas conduce to specu-
lation rather than breeding. It may be any
of these things; probably all play a part.
Certainly it behoves the Government to take
stock of results up to date before finally
deciding the fate of the additional 30,000,000
acres. As matters stand, the prospect of the
immolation of another 501 of our best sheep
properties fills no one with joy save, perhaps,
the land-sharks, the speculators and the
vote-angling politicians.
“Morice” (Darwin) : We have wished
many a time that we were back under South
Australian government again. There would
be less money wasted, there would be more
work done, the officials would not be quite
so spineless and there would be some chance
of the Territory progressing. Also, the
White Australia ideal might be carried out
a little bit more efficiently; for to-day it
seems to be a very real handicap to a man
to be a White Australian, and, if he happens
to be married, with a family, the handicap
is intensified. But, then, the average white
man, especially if an Australian, is not
a palm-greaser, such as the colored man is.
Under Commonwealth rule, recently, one
highly-paid clerk was sacked for the sake
of economy. To-day three junior clerks are
occupied in doing the work that the one
senior clerk did single-handed, and the three
juniors, together, receive almost twice as
much as the one senior did. Of the Lands
and Mines and other branches of the service,
the same tale of waste and superfluous offi-
cials can be told. Quite one-half of the
Government officials on the pay-roll could be
dispensed with. Take, for instance, the
Primary Producers’ Board, which has been
nothing but the most costly and wasteful
excrescence known. Of the settlers that it
has placed on the land, most threw up their
farms after a very few weeks of work; in
no case has a farmer made anything of a
success of his farm, and the few settlers
who were on their land when the board was
constituted are being so sickened that they
would leave, too, had they any .hope of
getting other jobs. At the Daly River pea-
nuts and other crops have been awaiting
transhipment to Darwin for more than six
months. The settlers are short of food,
and cannot sell their produce because there
is no transport. Under South Australian
rule, the out-back settler did at least get
mails and provisions with some pretence of
regularity.

“The Vic. State Government, defeated on its Bookmakers’ Turnover Tax, is hinting at a bill to legalise the totalisator.”
The usual type of remark which one hears
in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court,
where the 44-hour inquiry still progresses in
a circle:—
Chief Judge Dethridge: The unions say that
though health is not injured by 43 hours’ work,
nevertheless industry has reached the stage where
it can afford to give the workmen such increased
leisure as would arise from 44 hours. There is also
the proposition stated by Mr. Crofts, that too great
a proportion of the product of industry is taken
by the employing class.
Then the learned and three-headed Court
resumed the hearing of a hundred dozen wit-
nesses, some saying that industry has reached
such a stage of superfluous production that
the country can afford to reduce its output
by one-twelfth, and some saying it hasn’t,
and all proving nothing. Yet the matter
looks simple enough. In the four years to
June, 1922, Australia’s exports, being its
surplus of products over and above local
consumption, were £41,000,000 short of
the amount estimated as necessary to
pay outside liabilities. Therefore the coun-
try went into debt. For the four years to
June, 1926, the surplus products available
for export were about £140,000,000 short of
the amount required to pay for imports and
interest on outside liabilities. Therefore
the country went into debt a great deal
more. For the quarter to September, 1926,
the position was even worse. Therefore,
whatever the unions or other people say,
industry has reached the stage where it
can’t afford a 48-hour week, and even a 52-
hour week might be insufficient. Unless,
that is to say, means can be found for
producing a great deal more value in 48
hours than is produced now, or unless ways
can be discovered for an immense reduction
of imports, which would signify either more
work or doing without a very great number
of things which have come to be regarded
as necessaries of life. Failing some remedy,
the prospect is of an assured crash in which
the Court’s savings may wholly disappear,
leaving it to the sorrows of an impecunious
old age. The figures quoted are collected
from the work of one Wickens, an official
statistical authority who is supposed to
know more about figures than a hundred
judicial benches and a whole cloud of unions
and union secretaries. Any newspaper gifted
with bowels or compassion, or even with
one bowel of compassion, or half a bowel,
would naturally regret to see three Arbitra-
tion Court Judges skipping lightly on the
edge of a precipice of evidence in ignorance
of the almost certain doom ahead. Hence
these words of warning.
<S>
Britain’s great coal strike has so far died
out that all restrictions on the use of coal
are shortly to be removed, and one or two
lumps have even been exported. The strike
was a fight against the arithmetic book.
When coal rose from 13s. Bd. per ton to the
war record of 345. 10d., there was a big rise
of wages; also there was a silly law which
limited coal-digging hours to seven per day.
When the price dropped to 225. 7d. the wage
was, in the aggregate, more than the value
of the coal produced in seven hours, and it
became a question of either more production
or less pay. Mining-secretary Cook and
his kind swore that the arithmetic book
could be beaten if the miners held out long
enough, but they are drifting back to work
under a new law which makes an eight-hours
day optional, though not compulsory. At
latest advices secretary Cook was fighting
a rear-guard action, and declaring that there
will soon be a new strike to regain enslave-
ment to the compulsory seven hours, and
that next time victory is certain. But
Cook is, for the present, a spent force.

Sydney’s. Chief Stipendiary Magistrate Jen-
nings chose the occasion of his retirement
the other day to make some pertinent re-
marks concerning the conditions governing
the job of a N.S.W. Beak. The maximum
pension on retirement, £3 per week after 40
years’ service, is less than that of a John
Hop who has tramped his beat for 30 years
without collecting a single stripe. The oppor-
tunities for the ill-paid and highly-qualified
P.-M. or S.-M. to feather his nest in the
course of his extensive jurisdiction over
property and person are numerous, though
there is no record of their having been
utilised. Quite as bad an aspect of the
matter is the Beak’s uncertain tenure of his
office. He can be compulsorily retired by
Ministerial action at any time, and, according
to Mr. Jennings, Ministerial pressure has
more than once been brought to bear on
magistrates to obtain certain decisions. He
suggests the extension to magisterial office
of the law covering judicial appointments,
which prevents the removal of a Judge save
on a vote of both Houses of the Legislature.
Some safeguard is certainly overdue in a
community where the powers of the lower
courts have been extended till they are little
less than those exercised by a Judge and
jury.
O
From a Detroit (U.S.A.) business man: —
Referring to a paragraph in The Bulletin of
August 19, regarding “Priminister Bruce’s well-
intentioned scheme for sending a party of employers
and employees to the U.S.A. to find out for them-
selves how it is that so many workmen can ride to
work in motor-cars,” may I offer a suggestion ?
Would it not be more economical and effective to
have a representative familiar with the U.S.A. to
get this data and then submit a report to Mr. Bruce
or such employers and employees as may be interested
on the findings of such an investigation? At least,
such a report would provide a basis upon which such
r commission could start its investigations. Assum-
ing that the automobile industry should be included
in this investigation, it would require no less
than three months of intensive study on the part
of the commission to delve into the various phases
of that industry alone. But a representative who
is experienced in conducting investigations could
assemble the essential facts pertinent to this and
other industries.
Personally, I have no misgivings regarding
the future of Australia, but I have become
convinced that there are certain shortcomings
which prevent Australia from pushing forward as
rapidly as it might. The first of these, I believe,
is the failure of Australians to adopt the methods
of the Yankee in an effort to drive a wedge into
American markets. It can be done only through
employing Yank methods. Why is it that Australia
has not become the Mecca of the American tourist?
Certainly it is not because Australia does not want
the American’s dollar. And it cannot be because
of the distance between the Commonwealth and the
States, because each year thousands of Americans
encircle the globe on Dollar Line, Bed Star and
Cunard liners. No, it is because Australia has not
gone after the American tourist business in the only
■way it can be obtained.
The American tariff wall is not keeping Australian
products out of the United States. The Yank does
not worry much about what he has to pay for a
product; he only wants to be satisfied that he is
getting what he pays for. Cheap stuff is hard to
sell to the Yank. Quality and only quality counts.
Australia has quality goods. Why not sell them to
the American at a fair profit instead of catering
for a less profitable market in Europe ?

J. A. Norris, Vic. State Auditor-General,
has tabulated an informative analysis of the
interest transactions of Victoria. The aggre-
gate loan liability has grown in 12 years
from £69,607,326 to £135,717,277. Interest
has swollen from £2,448,304 a year to
£6,369,367. The average interest rate on
loans is £4 13s. 10d., so it has still some
distance to travel before it reaches the in-
evitable 5i or 54 p.c. on all loans. If the
debt stood still at £135,000,000 an extra
16s. 2d. would run into £1.091.000 extra
for the year. Already £1,349.181 is paid out
of taxation and other revenues towards the
interest bill. If our interest bill looks awful
to-day, it will be blinding and deafening in
12 years’ time. What is going to be done
about it? Apart from general economies,
one thing should certainly happen. Vic-
toria should resolve not to build new rail-
ways for a few years. Victoria is really
verv well supplied with developmental lines
as it is.

POLITIAL
POINTS
By the casting vote of Speaker Bowser,
Vic. Assembly carried the revised scheme for
the re-division of seats. Onl-y slight altera-
tions affecting Nunawading, Upper Yarra
(called Ferntree Gully in the first report),
Kara Kara, Borung, Ouyen, Waranga and
Upper Goulburn were made by the com-
mission, and a few names were changed.
Uastlemaine and Maldon, for instance, was
re-christened Castlemaine and Kyneton.
Upper House approval, which is needed to give
effect to tlie scheme, is a certainty, and then
will come the re-casting of the rolls, which
is expected to take three months.
Pennington, Gordon and Weaver, three
usually staunch supporters, who deserted
the Allancocks (Yic.) when the first scheme
for recasting Assembly scats was submitted
by the commission, returned to their allegi-
ance when the revised proposals were brought
forward last week. Two other Ministerial-
ists, Everard and Carlisle, however, broke
away and joined ex-Cocky Dunstan on the
Labor-Opposition side. Had not Jimmy Mc-
Lachlan, a consistent opponent of the redis-
tribution plans, responded to a personal
appeal from the very sick A- A - Di^ son to
give him a pair, the scheme (which was car-
ried by the Speaker’s casting vote) would
have been thrown out and a dissolution pre-
cipitated.
It came out this week that in an effort
to prolong his Government’s inglorious exist-
ence for another two months, Cann, N.S.W.
Health Minister and gag-mover, had sug-
gested to Miss Preston Stanley, who is one
of the Opposition M’s.L.A. for Eastern
Suburbs, that she should cross the floor. The
inducement offered was the passing of legis-
lation in which the lady has taken an in-
terest ; in return, she was to assist the Gov-
ernment to get six months’ supply. Miss
Preston Stanley made the House laugh when
she told it that Cann had said she was on
no account to tell Mr. Bavin, and it would
be “perfectly tragic if the general election
took place during the visit of the Duke and
Duchess of York.” The laughter broke out
again when the red-faced and angry Min-
ister, who has distinguished himself by his
opposition to titles, “explained” that he had
used the word “tragic” in another connection
—“I said the position in politics was a very
tragic one.” But trying to nobble a woman
member is really no laughing matter. It is
as low in its fashion as the affair of Kay.
“In connection with the finances,” N.S.W.
Premier Lang roared before his tail went
down, “Mr. Bavin will be told he will have
to economise and cut down, and he will do
it.” The Bulletin hopes he will, and
it brings the Works Committee under his
notice for a start. That body, besides cut-
ting up £4OOO or so a year in addition to its
ordinary salaries, merely provides Parlia-
ment with excuses for spending money on
hopeless works. It has, for instance, just
reported in favor of spending £350,000 on
cement works. Yet the Mines Department
reports that there has been something like
a boom in cement propositions. Big works
have been opened during the last 12 months
and two others are under construction; and
it is perfectly obvious that there is going to
be a cold time ahead for somebody. Yet this
ridiculous committee recommends the State
to jump into the business, too.
The chances would be a thousand to one
against any good resulting, still some Nation-
alist member might introduce a bill making
the residential qualification for a N.S.W.
Assembly voter three months in the _ elec-
torate instead of one. If by some miracle
it passed, the Government might be saved a
lot of expenditure on tents. A tent is a
thing which accommodates two presumable
Government supporters, ostensibly engaged
on public works, in a doubtful or hostile
constituency, till they get on the roll. If
they contrive to get on the new roll without
SOMETHING LIKE A HEAT WAVE.
“Hot? Oh, this isn’t hot! Why, up at Broken Hill in nineteen-three, if ice lit our
pipe we had to put the match in the ice-chest before we could blow it out!"
getting off the old one they can then vole
personally at one place and postally at an-
other, which is very handy.
S. Aus. Premier Hill must be envying
John Gunn his quiet job on the Migration
Commission. Assembly critics tore Hill’s
Budget to pieces, the Leg. Council is throw
ing out his measures, the unemployed are
pursuing him with insults, and the High
Court has declared his petrol tax unconsti-
tutional. Turning savagely on the Federal
Government, Hill accused it of “filching our
roads policy,” and it has certainly meddled
mischievously. But bitter words won’t make
the State petrol tax valid or satisfy those
who are demanding a refund of the large
amount of money—over £lOO,OO0 —already
collected and spent.
N.S.W. Premier Lang is one of those
shallow politicians who think they have said
the last word to the Opposition when they
challenge the latter to try to repeal some
Government legislation or other. Lang’s
latest challenge was about the 44-hour law.
It recalls a small pub-keeper in the early
days of Broken Hill who used to capture a
well-known mine-manager and set him going
on a wild drunk. Eventually the man’s wife
would turn up with a policeman. “Leave
it to the man himself whether he goes or
whether he shtops,” Bung would always say.
And when the man-on-the-bend decided to
stay and have a few more, Bung would
announce triumphantly: “That’ll show you
who’s his true friend —me or his missus.”
The application of the child-endowment
principle is to be extended in the Common-
wealth Public Service; instead of £5OO being
the limit of the salary of officers who get
the benefit, it will go in future to men receiv-
ing up to £6OO. Seeing that men getting
over that amount have to contribute their
share to the fund from which the benefit is
paid, there is no just reason why there
should be any limit at all.
Queensland sugar shippers must ache to
be delivered from wharf-laborers. The
quarrels of these gentry between themselves
and with outsiders have hit the northern
growers hard for two shipping seasons. Now,
with the sugar piled on the wharves, Queens-
land lumpers have been dragged into a strike
against overtime because the Sydney branch
of the union dislikes a decision of the Federal
Arbitration registrar. Half the work in
northern ports is overtime, the ships picking
up cargo as quickly as possible so as to
reach the next of the many “stops." North-
ern wharfies are by no means pleased at
being ordered to come out, for this is their
golden season, and there is always the fear
that the growers will load the stuff them-
selves, as they did in some ports last season;
but “solidarity” is a word of fear.
Even the Vic. Uppah Chambali gasped a
little at some of the views expressed on
the Women’s Disqualifications Removal Bill.
Dr. Harris, Honorary Minister, said that
“woman’s place was in the home," though
he didn’t mention where he got the right to
fix it. Russell Clarke’s bright contribution
was that there was a difference between a
judge and a barmaid; and some members
nodded —evidently at some time or other they
had found it out, too. However, in spite of
Harris. Clarke and seven others, the bill
survived the second reading by a majority of
six.
Out of 1279 applicants for two homestead
blocks thrown open at Booligal (N.S.W.)
recently, only 2<2 were permitted to face
the barrier. There was a lot of wailing and
gnashing of teeth amongst the non-starters,
but the Land Board deserves a cheer for
its heavy culling. In the past, almost any-
one could go to the ballot, and this was a
handicap to genuine landseekers who had
gone to the trouble of equipping themselves
for the life. For the other sort of land-
seeker there is always Tatt.’s.
Something like a casus ielli arose between
Maoriland and Tassy the other day when the
M.L. Marine Board wrote to the Hobart
ditto accusing it of permitting the infringe-
ment of the regulations governing the waters
of the Ross Dependency by the Norwegian
whaling fleet which is using Hobart for its
base. These regulations forbid whaling, in
the territorial waters of the dependency with-
out a M.L. license, and the Dominion wants
to know what about it. The Tassies side-
stepped by saying that the whalers had gone
before the communique arrived, and there
things rest for the present. For all that
there is little doubt that this whaling fleet
has been specially organised to dodge the
M.L. licensing regulations. It will have no
land depQt, everything being run from the
27,000-ton mother ship, which will always
keep the sea—ostensibly outside the terri-
torial waters —dealing with the captured
whales and maintaining the auxiliaries in
supplies.
Queensland Laborites are grinning at the
report from Sydney that the Lang Govern-
ment has ordered huge quantities of tents
for the requirements of laborers with votes.
These laborers are to be put on road work
which has been discovered to be vitally
necessary in various parts of N. S. Wales —
the particular electorates have not been
specified, though there should be little diffi-
culty in guessing them. Laborers with tents
(and votes) were of great value to Queens-
land Labor at the State election last May.
“0.P.H.”: Apropos of the N.S.W. Labor
effort to have Governor de Chair recalled
because he would not bend to the will of
Lang and swamp the Leg. Council deep
enough to allow it to drown itself, Downing-
street cut short the term of Governor Dar-
ling in Vic. a little more than GO years ago.
In Darling’s case, though, lie was, if any-
thing, too faithful to the Ministry (James
McCulloch was Premier and George Higin-
botliam Attorney-General) ; not only did he
back up Ministers in fighting the House of
Landlords, but, in despatches, he severely
criticised the other side. The row that fol-
lowed Darling’s recall supplied one of the
most stirring chapters of Vic. political his-
tory. The Assembly, which McCulloch and
Iliginbotham dominated, voted Darling
£20,000, but the Upper House threw out
the proposal. After much turmoil Parlia-
ment made a grant of £lOOO a year to Dar-
ling’s wife, and it was collected by her
annually till her death about 20 years ago.
By 18 votes to 8 Vic. Uppali Chain-
bali threw out a Labor bill providing for
compulsory voting at State Parliamentary
elections. Cohen and Edgar were the only
Nationalists to support the measure. The
majority were no doubt influenced by resent-
ment expressed by people at having to vote
at the last Federal referendum. So there
won’t be any forced voting when the first
poll is taken in the newly-defined Vic.
Assembly electorates.
Melbourne and Geelong aldermen are still
safe. Labor’s hardy-annual bill for their
abolition was knocked out by the Leg. Coun-
cil last week. Opponents of the bill showed
that stalwarts like Jeffries, Cabena and
Morell had served quite respectable appren-
ticeships as councillors before becoming
aldermen, dependent for tlieir seats upon
election by the councillors. The system has
its advantages; it opens the way for the
appointment of specialists who often haven’t
the knack of winning popular elections. But
in practice, nine times out of ten, it isn't
that sort of man who gets the seat.
Unless the situation alters, Newcastle
(N.S.W.) will hardly bother about having
a Christmas. The decision of the coal-
trimmers to leave off at 4 p.m. instead of
working round the clock may be only a
temporary huff, but while it lasts it will
reduce employment at the pits and on the
wharves, and scare away ships for fear of
demurrage charges. Then the increased rail-
way freights and crane charges, born of 44
hours and other devices, are reckoned to add
Is. sd. per ton to the selling price, and the
sordid foreigner may try to avoid paying.
The Lang Government, having lost its anti-
cipated revenue from the roads fund and the
tax on newspapers when its Budget went
overboard with a splash, and not having the
courage to reduce expenditure, can’t afford
to part with its freight increases—may even
be driven to put on more. The export of
coal to foreign parts is not much of a busi-
ness now, for, measured by value, it isn’t m
the same street with the export even of
raisins. Still, Newcastle would feel the loss.
WHAT’S COMING TO THEM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Ness, M.L.A., speaking at Petersham on the
N.S.W. political crisis, predicted that before four
months had passed Messrs Loughlin, Goodin and
Gillies would be brought back into the Labor fold
and there would be no election, as promised by Mr.
Lang.”
Ye are birds that our coop have deserted,
Ye are lambs that have strayed from our fold,
Ye are men from their faith that have ’Verted,
Like Newman and Manning of old.
We have argued and fruitlessly striven,
Yet still for rapprochement we yearn,
Come back, and ’twill all be forgiven,
O recreants, return!
Ye are renegades, true. Ye have ratted,
But your status may yet be restored.
Come back, and the calf that is fatted
Shall smoke on the banqueting board.
Return and ’twill all be refunded,
The kudos that from you you’ve thrown.
Come back, like the Prodigal Son did,
And we shall condone.
He sojourned in Nod or in Shinar,
The husks with the porkers to share.
You, too, if you stay where the swine are
Are bidding for similar fare.
Let no thought that you’re due for a slating,
Instead of a welcome, perplex.
Believe us, we’re all of us waiting
To fall on your necks.
Come back to the places you stood in,
Return to the seats that you filled,
O Loughlin and Gillies and Goodin,
And no more hard words shall be spilled.
Come back! We’ll assoil you of treason
And withdraw all offensive remarks;
You’ve four months to listen to reason
And cease being naiks.
Come back! Don’t be wrong-headed billies
Intent upon going to the pack,
Dour Loughlin and Goodin and Gillies;
While the gate is still open, come back!
And so you’ll avert an election
With all its attendant distress....
He speaks without risk of correction
On that point, does Ness.

It was rot an outstanding 12 months, but
the increased div. rate suggests that the
directors are satisfied with the position and
the outlook. A record sum was written off
the mine property, and that is wise account-
ancy. Most mines are merely holes in
the ground from their beginning, and even
the best end up that way. Lyell’s ore reserves
have long been moving downward. There
ivas no recalculation last year, although
more development and exploratory work was
done in the North I well than for some time:
and the old mine—Mount Lyell—was
touched for only 5469 tons of pyrites. Things
are to be shaken up a bit during the cur-
rent term. The new Blocks shaft is com-
pleted, and, once connected with workings
at various levels in the North, this will
permit of the deeper ore bodies being de-
veloped economically, particularly those at
the 1200 ft. and 1300 ft. levels.
North is practically the whole of the pic-
ture these days; it will remain so until
copper rises well above the level of the past
few years. The metal content of the ore
in the North gives it pride of place. Mapped
reserves in the respective areas compare thus :

Mt. Lyell (incl. S. Lyell) 1,619,529 0.5 1.50 0.04
Additional ore bodies will almost certainly
be disclosed in the North when the drill is
set going. Blister production for the 12
months was greater than in the preceding-
year :

But if they made £lO per ton of copper they
did very well. In 1923 electrolytic averaged
£73 125.; 1924, £67 17s. 6d.; 1925, £67 65.;
last year, £66 2s. sd. The huge low-grade
deposits of North America and the Belgian
Congo can be worked profitably at even
lower prices than rule to-day (£65 10s.), and,
despite an enormously increased world-con-
sumption, no promise of better things is
visible. Lyell’s experts have done their best:
costs have been reduced and treatment im-
proved—last year’s overall copper recovery
was 93.29 p.c. compared with 92.73 p.c. in
1925 and 90.74 p.c. in 1924. Future im-
provement in that respect can only be very
slight. Industrial awards have hit the co.
hard of recent years, but no further burden
was added last term, and costs were well held :
1924. 1925. 1926.
Mining charges .. £157,629 £143,340 £140,332
Concentration.. . . 87,983 79,150 84,281
Smelting charges .. 89,980 76,971 73,286
Freight and copper charges 77,449 74,493 82,440
With the Blocks shaft completed the more
economical working should show itself in
some reduction of mining charges, and that
will help a little.
Although the profits from mining are a
matter of guesswork, this lot of figures tells
a clear story :
1923. 1924. 1925. 1926.

Surplus £737,123 £805,015 £950,361 £983,730
The improvement for the past year was not
remarkable—£33,369. But £145,034—£16,115
greater—was paid out in divs. and big sums
outlaid on plant, chiefly on the chemical
works, a net £74,828 being added to the
latter; but as against that there was a sale
of 75,000 Wallaroo-Mt. Lyell Fertiliser
shares “on satisfactory terms.” Allowing for
that, however, plainly Lyell has been doing
well. Last year shareholders were told that,
notwithstanding increased wages, working
costs in connection with the production of
copper had been reduced, and the wages-
slieet in the chemical and fertiliser works
had diminished under economies resulting
from the plant extensions. Those are pro-
mising features. Meantime, shareholders
can see liquids in excess of outside liabili-
ties amounting to 15s. 3d. per £1 share, with
associated enterprises and shareholdings in
the hooks at three-quarters of a million. And
there is the railwav and the mine property,
the value of which is governed by the price
of copper. But the market isn’t perturbed;
it considers the co.’s expanding industrial in-
terests, and is prepared to buy at 28s. This
statement of capital invested indicates the
size of the associated enterprises:—
Chemical works (Yarraville and Fremantle) £560,007
Shares in other cos. .. .. .. . . 107,777
Hydro-electric plant .. .. .. .. 83,116
The chemical works are reputed to be good
profit-winners, and Metal Manufactures,
Ltd., of Port Ivembla (N.S.W.), which
handles the copper manufacturing (Lyell is
now practically the sole supplier), is a money-
spinner. What the associated and subsidiary
industries contributed last year is impos-
sible to see (income is grouped), but it is
certain that they rendered a very good
account of themselves. Increased and in-
creasing activity at the Kembla mills, where
copper-wire, cables, tubes, etc., are turned
out, may be surmised from chairman Swin-
burne’s statement that more than half of
Lyell’s output of copper last year was con-
sumed within the Commonwealth, and a
much larger proportion will probably be
taken in the near future. Further additions
were made to the Yarraville and Fremantle
super-phosphate works. A shortage of phos-
phate rock from Ocean and Nauru Islands
hindered- production, but not seriously. W.A.
farmers are considering a proposal whereby
they will become interested in the co.’s
undertaking in that State. Demand has also
increased for various minor products—elec-
trolytic caustic-soda is one—and that, too,
augurs well for the future.

Encouraged by rumors of a pending bonus-
issue, buyers pleaded for the scrip at 525.
early in the year. So far the bonus-egg
hasn’t hatched out, but the increase in the
div. for last half-year to 15 p.c. p.a. was
some compensation. And there are still such
hopes that buyers were lately seeking the
shares at 515., which, even on a 15 p.c. basis,
gives a return of less than £5 18s. p.c. The
hopes don’t seem ill-based either: seven years
have elapsed since the last bonus issue, and
in the interim £101,592 has been visibly accu-
mulated, besides quite a lot inside. Non-
taxable income from Government loans, for
instance, was once shown before it was put
out of sight; in the five years to February,
1925, £10,566 was so treated. Since then
the accounts have been dumb on the sub-
ject, although the holding in loans has in-
creased. And that is only one item of the
total expansion.
This is so much as the directors have con-
sidered it wise to disclose:—
Feb., Aug., Feb., Aug.,
1921. 1924. 1926. 1926.
Liabilities.. .. £34,684 £41,349 £40,183 £36,090

plant, etc. . . 282,819 273,872 246,149 242,064

Cash, etc 17,986 4,222 6,997 10,536
Shares in other cos. 9,308 3,653 3,634 3,634
Some, at least, of those figures need not be
taken quite seriously. Premises, plant,
stocks, etc., are in at less than the figure
of 10 years ago. Considering the co.’s pro-
perty purchases, new branches, manufactu r-
ing expansion and much larger turnover, the
latest figure, £242,064, indicates valuations
far below the true levels. W hen it is further
considered that the past decade has seen a
big increment in property values, the figure
almost blushes. The co. owns a big block
in the most valuable area in Sydney—picked
up for £85,000. It owns other valuable city
and suburban property. Two of its city
blocks alone would be rushed at more than
the total amount set down in the books.
Furthermore, stocks are nowadays much
heavier: not only are there more branches
to supply, but the co.’s manufacturing and
wholesale business is now substantial. At
the balancing date £37,281 was owing by
sundry debtors —an increase of 50 p.c. in
two years. As the co.’s retail business is
exclusively on a cash basis, that movement
suggests a progressive wholesale policy. It
is obvious that the directors are in a posi-
tion to do the handsome to shareholders
whenever they care to, and such an opera-
tion might be more politic than the payment
of big dividends. (Of last half-year’s dis-
tribution, 24 p.c. was labelled “bonus and
2i p.c. “special bonus.”)
Liquid assets have increased rapidly. Hold-
ings of gilt-edged securities have grown by
more than £llO,OOO in five years, and, exclud-
ing shares in other cos., £173,884 was more
or less liquid at August 31. If the directors
meditate any purchase or any policy ot.
expansion on the manufacturing side, they
have the wherewithal within reach. Mere
gift issues of shares will not alter the dis-
position of assets, of course, and it seems
improbable that over £lOO,OOO will be re-
tained indefinitely in securities earning little
more than 5 p.c. when the div. is 15 p.c.
The visible net assets are worth 28s. per
share; but with some assets so under-valued,
the calculation isn’t worth much. Hut at
51s. the market adds no less than £327,000
to the book value; and that is a very tidy
addition to justify.

Complaint from an importing house about
reduction of Customs duty isn’t often heard ;
but, Arthur Cocks not being a managing
director of conventional pattern, the report
of the board of this co. makes refreshing
reading, For example :
The Federal Government decided to revise certain
items in the tariff, and, after a period of nearly four
months of uncertainty, a number of articles of which
the co. carries extensive stocks have been declared
free of duty, although 30 p.c had, been paid on those
in hand. In other cases the duty has been reduced
from 20 to 10 p.c. The alteration thus made is of
a drastic character, unsought by importers, and has
depreciated those particular stocks by several thou-
sands of pounds.
To add to ’the co.’s troubles, a sudden cut
of 20 p.c. in certain goods owing to a price
war in the country of manufacture depre-
ciated the value of another lot of stock. A
smaller profit, under the circumstances, was
not surprising. That the management is
confident of the future is indicated by the
maintenance of 10 p.c. divs. for ordinaries.
Yet there has never been anything very
glittering in it for shareholders, competition
in most of the lines carried by the co. being
keen and overhead heavy. Nevertheless, the
co., which covers practically the whole of
Australasia —Queensland and Maoriland are
in the hands of associated cos.—lias made
steady progress to its present position ; and
paid capital has doubled in less than a
decade. Balance-sheet movements have been
as follows: —

Gash, investments,
etc 1,808 23,203 42,545 45,622
The £45,622 in the last line consists chiefly
of shares in subsidiaries which the report
says “have returned satisfactory profits.” The
completion of the City railway and the
North Shore bridge will result in a shift of
business activities to the area in which tin',
co.’s freehold is situated; the increment
already is estimated to amount to £25,000.
Creditors at July 31 could see plenty of sup-
port in stocks and book debts. Prefs. (< ami
8 p.c.), which rarely come into the market,
have exceptional backing; book values show
over £5 for each £1 pref. share. Buyers of

The CO. was formed in 1924 to take-over
Kornblum Prop., of Melbourne, and Ivayes,
Ltd., of Sydney, which firms were associ-
ated in business as importers and wholesale
softgoods merchants. Kornblums had con-
centrated on furnishings, furnishing drapery
and Manchester goods. Its Sydney branch,
opened in 1908, had been acquired by Kayes
in 1920. In the prospectus, profits (before
charging taxation) were certified as averag-
ing £16,168 for the preceding five years.
Vendors took 21,000 prefs. and 119,008 ords.
in payment for the business, goodwill being
included at £17,000. The public took up
45,000 8 p.c. cum. prefs. Results have
differed widely from prospectus figures, lhe
cause in the first term was act out us ad-
verse trading conditions” and the flooding
of the Melbourne warehouse”; last years
still poorer result was due to general
adverse conditions in the wholesale softgoods
trade and reductions in overseas costs pro-
ducing losses in stock values.’ E lindcrs-
lane and York-street undoubtedly had a
poor time last year. Shareholders are in-
formed, however, that “trading for the first
quarter of the current year shows such im-
provement that the directors feel confident
that the term will show a return towards
normal conditions.” The difficulty is to
determine what are normal conditions; actu-
ally, recent conditions may be normal.
There is certainly no guarantee that over-
seas prices will refrain from jazzing, and the
problem for most of such houses is to accom-
modate themselves to the changes that have
taken place in that and other respects.

handling. Prefs. are well enough secured,

disposed to answer a selling quote of 20s. 4d.

A little success attended the society’s hunt
for deposits, a net £14,120 being attracted.
It isn’t much. Current rates offered by
these offices in Melbourne are 4£ p.c. for six
months, 5% p.c. for 12 months, 6 p.c. for two
years. There is little in those figures to attract
the big investor ; but the little nest-eggers
who seek something more than savings-bank
interest might do a lot worse than look this
way. At September 30 the position of this
co. was very solid, and there are others in
the same line of business just as good. Its
figures were :

Apart from the deposits and minor creditor
items the society’s bank was helping with
£10,344; but the total of outside indebted-
ness was still less than £1 for every £4 of
the co.’s own funds. Exes, were kept well
in hand, and provided the management con-
tinues efficient the 10 p.c. seems sure enough
unless something bad happens to the coun-
try. The market considers the shares worth
28s. 9d. —which indicates that it regards the
10 p.c. as about set.

The Wild Cat Monthly will be published
at this week-end. It will review the posi-
tion of about 30 cos., so that investors may
see whether the stocks are good buying and
holding or good selling; also, new issues are
discussed, and investors will be able to tell
at a glance the return to be got from over
300 stocks. The Bulletin has been so
encouraged by the growing success of this
monthly that early next year it will be
enlarged and several new features added.
The price is 25.; it is to be had from most
newsagents or direct from the Sydney and

In the review of Allan and Stark, Ltd.
(W.C. 11/11/’26), it was stated that the
profit for the year, after providing for depre-
ciation, was £22,417. To that should have
been added taxation reserve of £4986 which
was taken in, making net profit for the year

Prospects of the Stanhills tinfield (N.Q.)
are improved by another area that McClel-
land and party, who hold the Mauretania
group, have taken up and prospected. The
crop of a large porphyry formation has been
tested by shallow shafts over a width of
50ft. and a length of 200 ft. Dish tests indi-
cate an average of about 5 p.c. black tin
along the crop, and at present prices (con-
centrates are worth £l9B up there at the
moment) it looks to have the makings of
a good property. It has been christened the
Queen. Prospecting work out at Mt. Cassi-
terite has revealed tin, but it is too
early to forecast results. The Government’s
five-head mill is ready, and only waiting for
the wet season to begin. If the market holds
Stanhills has a good chance of starting on
its career with a bang.

On Kangaroo Hills (N.Q.) the Sardine
naturally fills the public eye. It pays its
23rd threepenny on December 2. During
the past three months 62 tons of concen-
trates have been recovered, worth over
£ll,OOO. The directors have enough in the
till to make the festive Christmas season a
little gayer for shareholders. Among the
smaller fry on the field the Lion is improv-
ing as sunk on, and the hard tin leaders near
the surface have made into chlorite lode-
rock at 60ft., carrying fine tin over a width
of 3ft. It looks to have fair possibilities.
The Titanic is to be given another trial. It
has had two already; still, considering the
past experience of the Sardine, it has a
reasonable chance of making good. This
is the mine that the Brilliant Extended
crashed on when it got out of business at
Charters Towers. The co. paid £5OOO to the
prospectors, and got £9OO out of the ore at
grass, and very little beyond that. The
ore in sight pinched out rapidly, and very
little search was made for more, for the field
at that time had a poor reputation.

It must be placed to the credit of Saint-
Smith (the geologist) and Corbould that
they saw Mt. Isa’s potentialities in the early
stages. Few other mining engineers in Aus-
tralia would have given it a dog’s chance.
Not because it did not look big, nor because
it did not show values, but mostly because
of the narrow vision of the present mining
magnates of the Commonwealth. For that
same reason it might be well for the tech-
nical control to go into new hands. Twenty
years ago we were leading the world in
metallurgy. To-day, because our men have
lately lacked opportunities, we are about
10 years behind in metallurgy-eim-engi-
neering.
Mt. Isa lias some problems to work, out,
but none look insurmountable. First of all
it wants water, which is procurable, and,
from data so far collected, not at stupendous
cost. Coal will cost much the same as at
Broken Hill. Because of the huge carbonate
zone with the possibility of an even larger
(in point of tonnage) sulphide zone, there
will be probably two systems of treatment,
or at least one and a half systems. That
is assuming that gravity concentration will
be applied to both the carbonates and sul-
phides, and the tails and sands of the
former subjected to chemical treatment for
additional recovery of values. There must
be also two systems of mining, open-cut and
ordinary sinking. The former will of neces-
sity be' cheap. Not perhaps so very cheap
as Mt. Isa officials have publicly stated, viz.,
2s. per ton. Perhaps five years hence, when
the mine may look like a 3000-ton-a-day pro-
position, the open-cut costs will _be below
4s. per ton. All that, however, is in the air.
The sulphide zone will long before then have
been more than poked into and the true value
of Isa assessed. Given good technical control
and the capital, it at present looks to be
capable of very big things. That an organ-
isation of the calibre of Anglo-American Cor-
poration is going to run the rule over the
property, and was willing to take up 50,000
shares at par for the right to do so, sug-
gests what in some quarters was known, viz.,
that Isa's potentialities are better appre-
ciated on the other side than they are in
the Commonwealth.
No other buyers being about, Hampden
Cloncurry has had the machinery man on
the premises, but only small lots of plant
have gone his way. Tributors are sorting
out the best ore available in the Hampden
and Wallaroo blocks, but the dumps of high-
grade ore at Hampden and Trekelano so far
fail to attract buyers. Who can wonder, with
copper at £5B and labor wanting wages the
industry can’t afford, as things go to-day?
Pumps are going at the Trekelano, which is
the one mine worth clinging to because of its
stock of decent-grade ore. Apparently there
is a nibble for the assets in a lump, pro-
bably by Mt. Elliott, which could do with
them if obtainable on liquidation terms. Even
though the mines be idle Hampden has a
gross income of £51,902, mostly from shares.
It took £lO,OOO of that to meet field expenses,
which can’t be criticised, and a fattish £2762
for Melbourne and London exes. Holdings
in other cos. are in at cost, £156,500. How
much of that is Metal Manufactures and
how much Electrolytic Refining only those
inside know. Other assets were stores, etc.,
£48,946, and sundries £2922. The co. owed
£15,242, so apart from mine and plant
roughly £192,000 remained to be cut up
among 350,000 shares. But Metal Manufac-
tures scrip is worth a lot more than par.

The dust-up between the Bridge-Young
and the Chambers-Bronder groups of the
Australian Shale Oil Corporation was pretty
hot. It whs really a fight between Sydney,
which provided most of the money lured
by the reports about Murruruudi, and the
believers in the Bronder retort for the treat-
ment of shale. What has yet to be told is on
what field the Bronder retort had its appren-
ticeship. To settle its claims Holmes Hunt,
who does most of the high-class gas-expert
work in Australia, is to go to Latrobe
(Tas.), to which the co. has con-
fined its attention. Better late than
never. That he wasn’t put on to
bowl at first was simply because so many
laymen think they know as much as any-
body else about oil. So far the retort has
yielded 33,560 gallons of crudes from 805
tons shale, or 41 gallons a ton. That isn’t
bad. But at what cost? A debit of £10,199
is carried to p. and 1. —a loss of about 6s. a
gallon from the first spin. The sinker on the
co.’s line is £150,000 of capital paid up other
than in money. The cash got in tots up to
£95,668, and there isn’t much more to call.
Even when the present trouble is cleaned
up the uneven voting power will remain, and
it will have to be considered in any recon-
struction scheme.

Flagstone (N.S.W.) is not improving. In
the last fortnight the 10-head mill ran 130
hours —about 16 shifts —and put through
200 tons for 2 tons 18cwt. concentrates.
Further alterations to plant ate up much
of the time. And now “crushing will be
reduced to one shift unless rain falls in
the immediate future.” Since the beginning
of August 1346 tons gave tons concen-
trates. With tin above £3OO, this 2 p.c.
average would make a noise if the tonnages
were respectable.

Repeated stoppages at the big Pelaw Main
Colliery (N.S.W.) have been causing a deal of
anxiety in the northern district, because it
was feared that trouble might spread to the
whole industry. The original grievance
started with Pelaw Main men declaring a
“darg”—a slow-down of work. The manage-
ment responded with an order requiring the
output to go back to normal —or no work.
Of course no work it was. Richmond Main
men came out in sympathy. Hibble called
a conference and ordered the men back, and
also ordered normal conditions until the
whole matter could be threshed out. The
threshing didn’t happen quick enough, so
out they came again, but this time with a
long list of demands. Underlying the whole
business was jealousy. Men lucky enough to
cavil pillars have been making big money,
the reason being that in extracting these
pillars the men are well served with skips,
as the coal must be immediately filled away
or it is lost. So the “darg” was called for,
because it means an equal distribution of
skips. The week-end saw the trouble
patched up; but the district was no better
off, because the crane-men then decided on
a strike.

“G.D.M.” : I feel like losing an old friend
in the Carlisle, Bendigo, which is about to
shut down. Bendigo’s biggest gold-producer
was really a congeries of rich mines—the
Kentish, the Carlisle, the North Garden
Gully, the Golden Fleece, the Central Garden
Gully and the Passby United. The greatest
of these was J. B. Watson’s Kentish, an
amalgamation of three of these mines. The
old Carlisle produced £1,828,000 of gold up
to the end of 1920, when the curfew began to
toll the knell of departing Bendigo. J. B.
Watson was a digger at White Hills. De-
serting alluvial for quartz, he took up a
tiny claim on the Paddy’s Gully line, which
yielded 17oz. to the ton near the surface.
From 230 to 410 feet the Central Garden Gully
and Golden Fleece put out eight tons of
gold, and Watson, it is said, took 13 tons
of gold from the Kentish, all told, £2,800,000
worth. One Christmas-cake weighed 65000 z.,
or about £26,000. No payable stone was
found below 860 ft., though the shaft was
sunk to over 3000 ft. The Carlisle, too, has
been a failure in the deep ground. There
are 276 distinct quartz reefs in the Bendigo
district, which covers 4355 q. miles of gold-
bearing silurian rocks, in area 22 miles long
by 8 miles wide. In the 70 years ending 1921
the Bendigo-Sandhurst goldfield raised 624
tons of gold, or 20 million oz., worth 80
million pounds. The surface has been very
prettily scratched and pock-marked, but the
death of the Carlisle mine portends the dead
finish of the earth’s smallest and best gold-
field.

Waterloo, Holden’s Find (W.A.), is on the
Melbourne market. Capital, £30,000 in
60,000 shares, of which 40,000 are offered
to the public; 20,000 paids go to the vendor
as purchase consideration. Reef averages
12ft. wide at 130 ft. level, and developments
indicate good prospects of continuity in
length and depth. Hold values average about
505., but the ore lias a lead and copper
content that makes treatment costs
pretty high. The prospectus states: “It is
expected that the mine will be revenue-pro-
ducing almost from the recommencement of
operations.” Most goldmines are revenue-
producing from the start of ore treatment,
but profit producers are not nearly so numer-
ous. A five-years’ agreement with the ven-
dor as mine-manager is to be entered into.
In practice many such agreements have been
found not to be to the advantage of share-
holders. Why not choose a mine manager
in the ordinary way?

Brilliant Co. is tackling the difficult prob-
lems present in the Gnow’s Nest goldmine
(W.A.) in a business-like way. Treatment
arid mine-pumping units have been rendered
efficient, with the result that shareholders
may now look forward to everything worth
while being ultimately extracted. Whether
profits will be sufficient to meet the cost of
surface equipment and the expensive shaft-
sinking and crosscutting policy on which the
co. has embarked is doubtful.

Shareholders of Braeside silver-lead mines
(W.A.) are brimming with confidence. Last
report states that at the 125 ft. level the
mineral contents of the ore over a width of
Oft. are 60 p.c. lead and 290 z. silver. Capi-
tal ig in 100 shares of £5O each, but only
64 have been issued. Borneo Oil Option
Syndicate is making inquiries with a view
to acquiring the unissued 36 shares at par.,
and business may result. Further, London
buyers are in toimh with Braeside directors,
and it is probable that the main leases will
be sold outright to London.
* * * *
West Coast Silver Lead, Zeehan (Tas.),
has reached the end of its tether and pro-
poses to lengthen it by forming a new co.
Forty of its £5O shares have been fully
paid up by calls and more money is needed
for shaft sinking and dead work. Vendors
have been paid £5OO, and will receive £l5OO
more besides a one-eighth interest in a new
co. About £9OO worth of ore has been
produced and £llOO worth of seconds pad-
docked. A. D. Sligo says the lode has been
proved for 184 ft. in length, and bar one
break is ore-bearing all the way. The lode
measures Ift. to 4ft. He considered £5OOO
would sink the shaft 100 ft. and erect a wind-
ing and pumping plant. Secondary enrich-
ments ought to be met lower down. Zeehan
lodes were not big, but they were rich.
* * * *
“Mining Engineer” closes the discussion:
Gould Macdougall agrees that there is a tin boom
on at present, and that tin shares are altogether
too high, which is what I originally set out to
prove (B. 14/10/’26). I cannot understand how
he arrives at the conclusion that I am discredited
on my argument re depth in the Kinta Valley, but
I am prepared to await the result of the dredging,
which will settle all arguments regarding Malim
Kawar and the other Alluvial Tin properties there.
If, as he states, the Malim Nawar dredge commenced
in May, surely, if it is ever going to reach bottom,
it should have done so by now. From the official
reports issued I concluded the low outputs were due
to patches of cement gravel.
Mr. Macdougall asks why I reduced the engineer’s
estimate yardage of the Kundang dredge from 120,000
c. yds. per month to 90..000yd5. I never mentioned
the “engineer’s estimated yardage.” If he will refer
to my par (11/11/’26) he will see that I said this
dredge has a “nominal” capacity of 120,000 c. yds.
per month, which is quite a different matter. An
engineer would estimate the output of a dredge with
a nominal capacity of 120,000 c. yds., working on
average ground such as Kundang, at about 90,000yds.
per month, year in year out. He specially
mentions Kampong and Larut dredges as averaging
over 80,000yds. per month (which is about their
nominal capacity), but anyone with experience of
the East knows that the Taiping Valley, where these
dredges are working, is ideal dredging and much
easier ground to work than the average elsewhere in
the F.M.S. It is on points like the above that the
inexperienced make mistakes, and therefore the rest
of his remarks on capacity and yardage call for no
further comment from me.
Takuapa Valley output for the last two months
will need to be doubled and Mr. Macdougall’s ex-
pectations regarding' the rich run of ground the
Rawang dredge is now working will have to be
realised to hold share values to present prices, and in
the case of Rawang the buyer takes the risk of the
inevitable fall when present good recoveries cease.
Buyers should remember that a recovery of 70 tons
per month iri cos. like Takuapa and Rawang, capi-
talised at about £250,000, is only equivalent to
about a 30-ton recovery in companies of £lOO,OOO,
such as Assam, Karat and Kota.
On the subject of “prospectus estimates,” I have
shown how far short results have been in the case
of Rawang and Malim Nawar, the only Alluvial Tin
properties which have reached the producing stage,
and each prospectus estimate was made by Mr.
Newman. In the case of Selayang, there is a big
discrepancy between Newman’s and F. W. Payne
and Sons’ estimates. Very soon we will have the
results from Malim Nawar South, Itundang and Kuala
Kampar, and it will be interesting to see how
these compare with Mr. Newman’s prospectus valu-
ations.

A report was cabled last week on boring
operations in Ratrut Basin’s new area. The
boring is Said to have tested 18 million yards
in the main area, occupying the lower levels
of the property. It “fully confirms” the
vendors’ average values of 13oz. and 15oz.
for holes that reached bottom. The general
manager considers that the bores on the
higher-lying and lower-grade ground will
show a total of 30 million cubic yards, of a
value not estimated, while all values given
are subject to an assay of the concentrates.
The chief interest of the report lies in the
values given for “holes which reached bot-
tom.” An inference is that some of the
bores did not bottom. How deep does some
of the ground go? If it is because of exces-
sive over-burden, it means extra-deep dig-
ging, and that usually spells extra-steep
costs. Varying depths may also mean rock
bars running through the alluvium, or an
otherwise uneven bottom —neither beloved of
the dredging miner in Malaya or anywhere
else.

Kampar River’s much-tested property has
been reported on by the arbitrators. Alluvial
Tin, which finds J. M. White’s original pros-
pectus values to be correct. This entitles
the Kampar co. to pick up £87,000 from
London for its total assets, representing—
after allowing for a little backwash and
liquidating expenses—-a distribution of about
13s. 6d. per share.

“Venturino” : Probably the quickest clear-

Australia took place on November 11,
1840, in Adelaide. One Joseph Stags
was standing his trial for murder, the
court being held in a large room of
Judge Cooper's house at Whitmore-square.
Just as Colonel Tolmer, that peppery and
plucky police chief, had completed his evi-
dence, a sudden, sharp report, as of a pistol,
rang through the room. “He’s shot at!”

federate of the prisoner had taken a pot
shot at the witness; and in half a minute

the governor of the gaol were the only two
who remained behind with the prisoner. Pre-
sently the cause of the alarm was found m
the cellar beneath the courtroom. One of
the hardwood beams supporting the floor of
the room, unequal to the weight of the close-

crack. It was quickly fixed up with props;
and a somewhat shamefaced Judge and jury
resumed the trial.

“Q.Q.”: The Army M.O. who knows his
job can do a lot. In a certain Fusilier
Reserve battalion camp on the east coast
of England during the war, I had been in
the habit of jibing at the Adjutant, with
whom I lived, while he dressed in total
darkness at five o’clock. I arose at about S
a.m. Whether this was the cause of the
trouble I know not, but one morning after
sick parade the Colonel sent for me. I
entered the orderly-room, clicked my heels
and saluted. “Good morning, sir.” “Cap-
tain, what time do you see your sick
parade?” “Nine o’clock, sir.” “Huh, in
future you will see them at 7 a.m. Good
morning.” Next morning was cold and
snowing, and in an unhappy frame of mind
I got through all my work. Then I sent
for the Colonel’s batman. Now the .Colonel’s
batman had been with him for 17 years, and
nothing would make the Old Man part from
the man, who was mother, aunt, cook, ser-
vant and nurse rolled into one. He had
seen to it that the batman’s medical cat-
egory was C3 —fit only for home service. On
the other hand, my duty was to get men fit
and gradually raise their medical category
to A1 —fit for active service. So I ran over
the Colonel’s batman, passed him Al, and
retired to await events. I had not long to
wait. A breathless orderly announced, “The
Colonel wants to see you, sir—urgently, sir.
'E’s in a ’ell of a temper, sir.” He was.
The adjutant, behind the Old Man’s back,
was thoroughly enjoying himself. “Captain.
what the do you mean by passing
my servant Al? Don’t you know 111 lose
him?” “Well, sir, you are always telling
me I am too lenient with these men. I
thought you would be pleased that I had
found another lit man, sir.” He glared at
me. “You know well that he is
not fit.” I knew nothing of the sort, but
suggested something about the bad light in
my sick bay at 7 a.m. The Old Man went
red, purple and finally green. Then he
laughed. “Do you think you could see better
at 9 a.m.?” “Yes, sir.” “All right, d-
you, have your sick parades at 9 a.m.” I
marched out. The Adjutant had ceased to
be amused.

“Windsor” : A man who ought not to buy
a ticket in Tatt.’s lias come to light in Mel-
bourne. He was up before a Fitzroy bench
on a charge of having been drunk, and the
beak, after making it 10 bob or three days,
suddenly leaned forward, settled his spec-
tacles firmly on his nose and peered intently
at the prisoner. Then he whispered some
hurried instructions to the sergeant, and the
man in the dock was re-arrested and hauled
before another magistrate on a fresh charge.
It transpired that he was the undetected
housebreaker who had some weeks back
paid a couple of unauthorised visits to the
first beak’s home. He had at first pinched a
few odds and ends; returning later he had
appropriated a more extensive collection, in-
cluding a suit and four shirts. Then he had
the rotten luck to appear in the suit
before the man it had been stolen from.

w ile the steamer circled round the lighted
buoy which had been thrown overboard. The
only hitch in the proceedings was the
presence of the alleged suicide among the
throng which crowded the rail to see herself
rescued. After this had been discovered, the
orders from the bridge were curt and force-
ful, and the ship soon was on her run again
towards the light on Venus Point.
THE GREAT KNOWLEDGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A-many trials I have had,
And blessings—well, they’re mighty few;
But, still, the blessed with, the bad
I try to lump as most folk do;
But times I feel within my bones
There's trouble stored for neighbor Jones.
And yet ’tis little I can show,
As little any other can,
To his discredit; he is—oh,
A worthy but a knowing man.
There’s provocation in the tones
In which “I know! I know!” says Jones.
Now, Smith and Thwaites, I fear, arc thieves;
At certain seasons Iloneybun
1J is morals sheds like withered leaves,
Yet I can suffer them, each one;
While Jones no single .sin condones,
But still “1 know! I know!” says Jones.
No earthly nor aerial thing,
No trifle sunk beneath the sea,
Acknowledged ignorance can wring
From him as ’t might from you or me;
It boots not, hieroglyphs or hones —
Whate’er your theme —“I know!” says Jones.
Though long you labor through the night
To light some little path obscure,
Contain your pioneer’s delight
For, reckless man, be very sure
Your knowledge one already owns;
A curt “Ah, yes! I know!” says Jones.
Ksteem of man or man’s disdain
I can endure- with equal calm,
And e’en, I think, the brand of Cain
1 might invite without a qualm ;
This thought I sometimes breathe to Jones
In sudden awe —“I know!” he drones.
And on some evening, clouded, drear,
When dreadful wings about you beat,
Be not surprised if you should hear
In his or my own garden neat,
Above whatever wind that moans,
A strained “I know! 1.... HELP! !!” from Jones.
But ere he quits his gurgling breath
I’ll ease my fingers at his throat;
Just on the borderland of death,
One moment glad, I’ll pause to gloat
“You’re straight for Hell!” And o’er his moans
I’ll wait to hear, “I know!” from Jones;
Hear once with joy —“l know!” from Jones.

WHAT’S IT GOING TO COST?
“Though no one apparently has any definite ideas as to what it all means, the Imperial Conference’s report on inter-imperial relations is alleged to have raised the
status of Prime Ministers, Governor-Generals, High Commissioners, etc.”
AUSTRALIA: “I don’t mind you blokes dolling yourselves up; but, mind you, I’m not paying for any more of it.”
“Mars”: I shall never forget my first
brief in a criminal case. I was practising
in a country town, the local pub was burgled
one Saturday night, and a local lad was sub-
sequently arrested. In response to an inti-
mation from the police that the prisoner
needed a legal adviser, I interviewed him.
He protested his innocence vehemently,
declaring that he wasn’t in the town on the
night in question, and had several witnesses
to prove it. After taking down his state-
ment in detail, I broached the question of
my fee, and a certain sum was agreed on.
In response to my request for one-half down
before the hearing of the case, he asked if
I couldn’t wait till the case was over. I
made it perfectly plain that I could only
undertake his defence on the terms indicated.
“Well, then,” he said, “go out to the Gov-
ernment dam, and at the south-east corner
you’ll find £B5 buried in a tin. Take the
amount of your fee and leave the rest.” It
is perhaps unnecessary to add that £B5 was
the exact amount stolen from the hotel.

“Sixenate” : The arm of the law has given
proof of its length in Sydney by reaching
a man who spoke nasty words to a police-
man in 1912. Released on his own bail,
this man failed to come up for trial, pre-
ferring to sacrifice the change he might
have received ; and he had regarded himself
as square with the Law on that transaction
until a long-memoried John Hop recognised
him in the street and remembered the old
warrant. In the interim the man, so he
swore, had done his bit at the war, the con-
stable who arrested him had left the force,
and another policeman who was in a posi-
tion to give evidence had been appointed to
a far-back country town ; so the magistrate
dismissed the case. There was another recent
long-distance arrest when a forgotten war-
rant came to light and caused the apprehen-
sion of a man who had settled down to
respectability and was the father of a decent
family. The charge in this case was the
theft of an overcoat 17 years before; and
here the magistrate went further and spoke
scornful words about the futility of the
police action. Indeed, it was worse than
futile; it was mischievous.
* * * *
“Baomata” : What is the chief attraction
for Binghi in grog? Is it the “kick” or
the “bite”? I am inclined to think that a
non-intoxicant without “kick” is as popular
as the other if it has plenty of “bite.” The
only thing to induce Binghi in these parts
(Nor’-Westralia) to engage on schooners for
trepang fishing is the promise of a good nip
of “curry” _ every day. Supplying grog to
nigger carries a penalty of six months with-
out the option. Grog, too, is expensive, and
our Old Man wouldn’t dream of infringing
a law if it cost him anything, yet our boat
is rushed with applicants for jobs as soon
as we come inshore. This is how we draw
’em. The skipper keeps a stock of chillies
and we brew grog this way. (1) A handful
of well-dried chillies to a kerosene-tin of
water; boil well and add a couple of pounds
of brown sugar. (2) Put a half-pound of
dry chillies to the same quantity of water,
and the result is a fluid as drastic as a fly
blister. It is. No. 2 which keeps up our
stream of applicants for schooner jobs. When
Binghi comes in after a long day on the
reefs picking trepang, he is cold and wet
and tired, having worked his best pace to
secure. the “double ration” given to the
two “ringers.” After dinner is “grog-oh!” The
darkies range up along the for’ard deck, their
tongues hanging out. The Old Man, looking
as dignified in his mess uniform as if he were
on the quarter-deck of an admiral’s ship,
comes along and carefully pours out two
fingers of our mixture, and the Binghis drink
it like a liqueur. They gasp for breath,
tears roll from their eyes, and when they
can speak again they compliment the Old
Man—“ Proper ’ot fella inside belly, that
one. Gib it one more little-fella, please.”
But the Old Man waves them off majesti-
cally without a word or smile, and the cere-
mony is at an end. The two candidates for
a second helping are watched by jealous
eyes as they toss off their second draught. The
Binghi will refuse rum and even whisky for
this, and our Old Mari is certainly the most
popular skipper on the coast with colored
brother, for at lay-up he not only gives each
man an extra ration, but goes to the length
of giving each one a bottle to “take away
camp.”
* * * *
“Prickly Jack” : Imagine the whole street
of any country town placed on wheels and
you get an idea of the supply train for
Federal employees along the Trans, line
which leaves Port Augusta (S.A.) every
Thursday, carrying about 1000 tons. The
store (retailing groceries, moleskin trousers,
and dingo-traps), butcher’s, baker’s and
greengrocer’s shops, post-office and savings
bank are all on wheels; likewise fuel and
water for locomotive and requirements for
the train team. The population at each
wayside station does its shopping while the
vehicle waits.
* * # *
“L.C.M.”: Women doctors and lawyers
are ordinary enough affairs in Sydney, but
the arrival of “the lady doctor for the
schools” is quite an event in many a bush
township, and rather a jar on the intense
masculinity of the small boys. A ragged
little girl danced up to me in the village
street the other day. “Hey, Miss,” she said,
“I like yer, but me brother Clarry says if
yer take Ms clothes off he’ll stab yer!”
* * * *
“Jobber”: It isn’t at all that the French
peasant woman is immodest; but she does
hate to miss a franc. One wild night I
lobbed into a small village, and after a few
duds struck an old madame who, after a
moment’s hesitation, said she had a bed-
chamber to let. She showed me the room;
there were two double-beds crowded in it,
but the extra one didn’t worry me. About
an hour after I had turned in I heard
stealthy movements, and the kind of noise
I should imagine a female would make when
disrobing. In a few minutes there was a
creak, very much like someone getting into
a wooden bed. I didn’t move a muscle, but
in the morning the second bed showed that
someone had camped there the previous
night.
* * * *
“Muggins, Junior”: It isn’t always the
deadbeat who regards water with aversion.
A wealthy farmer recently admitted to a
Mallee (Vic.) hospital, with burns on his
back and legs, frankly admitted in answer to
some leading questions by the doctor that he
had not taken a bath for 16 years. The
quack sought to head the patient for the
bathroom, but the farmer desperately
struggled into his clothes and broke away
for home. His excuse was that he had
suffered from Bright’s disease as a young
man and had been warned never to have
a bath.
# * * *
“Disselboom”: There is an atmosphere of
mystery about the presentation to General
Hertzog of the late President Kruger’s “tra-
velling waggon” by the Lord Mayor of
London. The latter said that the relic had
been brought home by Kitchener, and by
him passed to the City of London. “K.”
was a notable collector, but it is hard to
imagine the greatest enthusiast lugging a
20-span ox-waggon all the way from the
Gape to England. More likely the relic was
the Old Man’s cape-cart, /'which bore him
swiftly on all his journeys to commandoes
at the front. After he left Pretoria Kruger
lived on the rail, only abandoning his car-
riage when he took refuge at Lorenzo Mar-
quez before embarking for Holland, so he
had no waggon on that trek. The two-
wheeled cape-cart, with its four horses, was
a much handier proposition, whether regarded
as a curio or transport. In their later, hard-
pressed days, the Boer commandoes often
mounted machine-guns on them.
* * * *
“Der Jong” : A neat stage-setting was- in
evidence in Johannesburg last week at the
annual Maf eking dinner. General Baden-
Powell, the of Mafeking, sat
cheek-by-jowl w/ith Sarel Eloff, the long, slab-
sided son-in-law of Oom Paul, who was given
the job of “besieger” after Oronje had been
transferred to the western front to check
Methuen’s advance on Kimberley. That
“siege” was the joke of S’Afriea, if not of
all military history. Eloff wanted no-
thing better than to sit down on the veldt,
far from war’s alarms, and snooze the happy
hours away. He was so easy-going that
“8.-P.,” in desperation, had to justify his
position as a besieged general by perform-
ing all those weird stunts that later earned
him the name from an admiring South
Africa of “Barnum”-Powell. The writer is
game to wager that last week’s affecting
rapprochement was one of “Barnum’s”
bright ideas.
* * * *
“No. 6158”: They had strange conceptions
of Australians in some of the English back-
blocks. During one leave in Blighty I was
asked by a dear old lady if I had experienced
much trouble with the camels in Egypt. I
did not hesitate to expand on the subject,
whereupon she said sympathetically, “Too
bad! They should have left the camels to
the men who were used to them and let you
Australians bring your own kangaroos!”
But my most cherished recollection is of a
very ancient rustic I met at an isolated
village inn when on a walking trip. He
leant on his stick and regarded me from
beneath bushy brows. “Who be ye?” he
croaked. I told him and he nodded silently.
“And be ye a fighting man?” I modestly
mentioned something of my war record. He
pondered it. “And which side be ye on?”
he asked.
* * * *
“Nonton iki”: Those fearsome lizards that
Cobham saw were friends of mine on the
west coast of Sumatra. My introduction to
one I remember well. I was gazing dreamily
out of the open window of the kantoor one
afternoon when it occurred. Amat, the
house-boy for a half-caste living near by,
had, after the usual neck-plucking and
prayer-mumbling, slain a decent-sized fowl
and had thrown it down to give it oppor-
tunity to get its somersaulting and blood-
spattering over, when out of the blady grass
and wild-finger clumps crawled a fine speci-
men of this giant lizard, and in one gulp
swallowed the fluttering chook. Amat (as
soon as he got his breath again) gave the
alarm to about 30 or 40 mine boys, who
were just coming off shift, and a raid was
made on the mine-store a few yards away
for fighting weapons. Then the fun began.
As a zoological specimen of world-wide inter-
est, the dinosaur’s value to them was nil,
but as a container of Amat’s chook —well,
there was something in it. Hoes, Malay
axes, brush-hooks and an adze or two all
rattled on its armor-plated back and head
as it waddled off. Ghandi, the Sikh police-
man, had a smack or so at it with his trusty,
rusty sword; it sounded like a parasol hit-
ting a stone wall, and had just about as much
effect. All their assault only made Dinny
waddle a bit more quickly, and it looked
for a while as though the half-caste would
have ekan bring —dried fish —for his supper.
Then a fluke shot with a sharp 7ft. crow-
bar got Dinny in the neck and put him out
of action. He was soon ripped up, the chook
retrieved and plucked, and the half-caste
had his fowl at the usual hour. It took
about 10 boys to drag Dinny’s carcase away
to a “healthy” distance. He was only about
Bft. long, but was nearer 4001 b. than 2001 b.
As for jumping on the back of a horse, I
would as soon imagine Billy, the fat pig, of
the side-shows, doing it as lie.

“R.W.T.” : The most exciting shave I ever
had was during the war in a small house in
the main street of Morbecque, France. There
were two chairs in the saloon. Madam ', an
adorable newly-wedded young thing, lathered
one patron, while Monsieur shaved the other.
There was no lack of custom, the subtle per-
fume of Madame’s hair and her gentle
manipulation of the brush being magnets to
the Diggers. There were half a dozen wait-
ing to be shaved on this particular night,
when there was an ominous buzzing over-
head. “F'ritz is up,” someone standing near
Ihe door warned us. Monsieur was at work
under my chin at the time. A second later a
shell dropped close by, and he leapt three feet
in the air, the razor swishing past my jugu-
lar vein and just slicing the skin. Madame
disappeared head-first under a bed, screened
off in a corner of the room, roughly dispos-
sessing a fox-terrier which came out yelping.
I always shaved myself in France after that.
* * * *
“Bendee”: I think “M.C.” is in error
when he states that “Houdini first flew in
Victoria in 1910” (B. 18/11/’26). Houdini
had his Voisin parked in a marquee on Rose-
hill Racecourse for a week or so before he
made a flight there in 1910, but for days
he would make no attempt at flight if there
was sufficient breeze to disturb a handker-
chief held out in the hand. He was pos-
sibly waiting for a full house, and eventu-
ally flew on the last day of his stay before
a fair crowd. I recall that the propeller
of his Bleriot was behind the wings of the
’plane, and in his daily lecture on the work-
ing of the machine, Houdini emphasised that
the propeller must be at the rear of a biplane
as the machine must be pushed to obtain
flight, whereas a monoplane rose by being
drawn, and must have the propeller in front.
He assured us that the reverse of this theory
would make flight impossible in both cases.
At the same time, Defries, of motor-racing
fame, was attempting flights in Victoria with
a vY right machine, but met with no success.
A PROTEST.

“T.T.R.”: There was some rough-and-
ready physicking, beside surgery, in the old
windjammers. The skipper had to carry a
medicine-chest, but except for a few well-
known drugs he was liable to know little
about its contents, and his dosing of the sack
was largely of an experimental nature.
Thirty-three years ago I travelled from
Mauritius to Fremantle aboard a barque
which had been trading from Australia to
S'Africa for many years. The skipper and
the mate were the only whites; the crew
were colored, all hues and races, from Malay
to Malagasy. The Old Man, a huge, black-
bearded Adclaidean, was showing me his
medicine-chest, and he remarked with a cer-
tain pride that only once had a patient died
on his hands. “I tried him with nearly
everything I had,” he said ruminatively cap-
ping the chest, “but nothing seemed to do
him any good. He got weaker and weaker,
and at last I asked him if there was any
thing he had a fancy for. He said he thought
he could eat a bit of goose. We always carry
some poultry, so I got the cook to fix up a
leg for him. He got through most of it
before he died.” I never learned what the
skipper thought his patient died from, but
I’m certain it wasn’t goose.
QUITE A NICE EVENING.
GEORGE: “Had a good time?”
GEORGETTE: “Ooh — lovely! Three proposals,
two engagements and a terrible row with

“Bartholomew Burls”: The astonishing
prices realised in London at the sale of the
late Lord Michelham’s collection —they
totalled well over a million —is strong evi-
dence of the amount of loose cash which
America has to throw to the birds, for nearly
all the purchasers hailed from over the
Atlantic. The pictures alone realised 412.000
guineas; in a catalogue containing many
superb Gainsboroughs, Romneys and Rae-
burns, it is surprising to find a Laurence
portrait bringing the huge price of 74,000
guineas—a record. Laurence was the last
of the great Georgians; highbrows in art

have always damned him as too slick and
pretty-pretty, without the “guts’’ of Gains-
borough or Romney, to say nothing ot tlie
virile Scot Raeburn. Still, the admirers
of these need not growl. One Gainsborough
brought 44,000 guineas and a Raeburn
23 500. Four Romneys brought 120,OUt*
guineas. The sale is one of the many forced
by the heavy taxation to pay Uncle Sam s
loan bill. It is some solace for the loss ot
the masterpieces that Uncle is finding a little
of the cash to pay himself off.

“Erua” : Two brothers named Perano were
invited by a MX. Nautical Court the other
day to explain which was responsible for a
collision between launches. They represent
rival interests, and the signal that a whale
is entering Cook Strait causes tremendous
excitement in Tory Channel, the competi-
tors’ headquarters. First there is a mad
race that would delight the heart of any
movie director, as the two tiny ships tear side
by side towards the whale, harpoon the mon-
ster, hitch on to him, and fight valiantly for the
prize. Such small incidents as being flung out
of the water by the diVing whale or brushed
liv the unexploded boriib buried in the
monster’s tail, or being rammed by one
another whilst in the thick of the fight have
never been allowed to interfere with the
procedure of the competing launches, and
it was only after an especially hectic chase,
when one badly-rammed launch narrowly
escaped sinking, that the authorities took a
hand The Court, in ordering one Perano
brother to pay up £25, remarked that whai-
ing was perilous enough without the acldi'
tional excitement of a marine battle, and
recommended that when any craft is fast to
a whale all other craft shall stand off at
least a quarter of a mile.

“Harold Hardupp”: A Sydney suburban
parson, though used to queer troubles, felt
that he had about reached the limit when
he was wakened at two o’clock the other
morning by a vehement caller who told him
thickly “We wanter get married.” The
parson might have shut the door straight
away, but his curiosity was excited by the
absence of the other part of the “we.” The
potential ’groom looked around in amaze-
ment on being asked whgre the lady was.
and, with a sob in his throat, said he must
have dropped her on the way. Then a
thought occurred to him, and he put it into
words; the lady was probably mislaid some-
where in the garden. The parson found him-
self swept away by the piteous entreaty ot
his visitor into a search for the missing
woman; and, the garden being very dark
and his visitor unsteady, the pair floundered
into rosebushes and other prickly things.
They didn’t find the girl, but the parson kept
his temper admirably till the drunk hiccuped
waruingly: “Remember, young feller,.theresh
a woman shomewliere ’bout, so don’t use any
bad language.” Then he hunted his caller
out and slammed the gate.
“Wang”: The
storm that blew
the Malaita into
Stubbs’s baths at
South Melbourne
rlie other day
played capers that
were not recorded
in print. A sedate
citizen, walking
along a street that
climbs a steep hill,
suddenly found
bimself whizzing
down this hill at a
great rate. A sheet
of galvanised-iron
had blown off a
building, and be-
coming involved
with it he was
now experiencing
all the thrills of
tobogganing. An-
other elderly gentle-
man, a pillar of
the church, had a
less boisterous bur
probably more un-
palatable experi-
ence on that wild
and windy day. As
he went his sober
way, the contents
of a clothesline
came sailing past
him, and one bit of
lingerie, detaching
itself from the rest,
wound itself around
his neck. There
was a round of
cheers from a gang
of laborers in the
street as he
dragged the em-
bracing thing from
bis neck and
hurled it savagely
mto the gutter. It
was a dainty silk garment, too.

“R.H.W.” : There are few humorless Yids.
A cobber of mine recently sold a car to one
of the Chosen—we’ll call him Levy—and the
next day rang him up. “Is that Mr. Levy.
“Yetli, Levey thpeaking —what ith it t My
cobber asked if he had taken out an insur-
ance policy on the car. There was a touch
of scorn in the reply: “Didn t I tell you my
name ith Levy?”

“A.8.C.”: A Sydney bank-teller holds the
record for being the man
oftenest rejected for service
with the A.I.F. He has 27
rejection certificates and five
rejection badges; and he
volunteered four times before
certificates were issued. Be-
sides, he has letters declin-
ing his offers of service with
the Army Medical Corps,
Army Pay Corps, Army Ser-
vice Corps and also as _ a
munition worker. In spite
of his frequent rejections,
the man really believed he
was physically fit for service,
and either every attempt he
made was conscientious or he
was a superb bluffer.
“John’s Wood” (Lond.) :
Permanently waved hair for
men is one of the most amaz-
ing developments in London
fashions. It is to
be seen in all pro-
fessions and walks
of life among
actors, singers,
business men, doc-
tors, lawyers, shop
men, motor sales-
men and the youn-
ger politicians. As
an answer to the
Eton crop, which
remains the most
favored mode
among young
women, it is cer-
tainly very effec-
tive ; in fact, speak-
ing as a woman, I
grant that it gives the men the best of the
deal.

“Black Tracker”: When I was gouging
opal in the palmy days of White Cliffs
(N.S.W.), one of the owners of a claim near
mine had a queer experience. Having struck
good stone, he took in a fair-sized parcel to
sell to a buyer. He was paid some shillings
over £2OO. Placing the notes in a secret
pocket, he adjourned to the hotel and
shouted. Although practically a teetotaller
he had a few drinks. Shortly after, feeling
queer, he made for the back yard, where he
struck an old cobber who was employed as
groom. The cobber, noticing his mate’s con-
dition, and knowing tnat he had money on
him, became scared, as the place was teem-
ing with tough characters. He rushed him
into a cubicle and told him to have a sleep.
Some hours later, when the gouger awoke,
his first act was to feel for his money. It
had disappeared: the pocket was empty.
Being philosophical, the man decided that he
alone was to blame, and as it would be
a thousand to one against him getting his
own back, he returned to the mine without
mentioning his loss to anyone, after having
drawn sufficient from the bank to pay his
partner’s share. Some weeks later, when
working the claim, his mate called out that
word had just been brought that the groom
at the hotel had fallen and struck his head
on the stone step in front of his door. “Stone
step! Stone step!” said the man in a
strange way, and the next moment, without
a word of explanation, he got on his bike
and disappeared. He made straight for the
cubicle, and on reaching it, raised the large
flat stone and heaved a sigh of relief. There
lay the wallet with the notes intact. He
had put it there when his brain was mixed
and forgot about it until he heard the men-
tion of the groom’s stone step.

“Sol. M.”: “The Whispering Gallery,”
that book of alleged intimate reminiscences
concerning the rich and the great which took
in the old yet unsophisticated Lane publish-
ing firm, looks an unconvincing fraud at this
distance. The writer was alleged to be an
ex-diplomat of great tonnage, so it might be
supposed that he spent his life diplomatising
at the courts of foreign Powers. Yet his
ear was apparently glued permanently to the
keyholes of Ministerial apartments in London,
while his eye gazed in at the window or
down the chimney. The extract which was
cabled to Australia, purporting to be a peevish
hit of conversation in which Asquith, Lloyd
George, Grey and others took part after a
Cabinet meeting, was rather dull and rather
rude. You couldn’t read it without won-
dering how a diplomatist contrived to
be so long kneeling on the doormat as to
hear all that without being violently removed
by a flunkey of short temper. Hesketh Pear-
son, who sold the manuscript to the now
infuriated publishers, is described as being
an author in a small way himself —enough
of one, anyhow, to be a member of the
Savage Club, whatever that may be worth.
He refused for a time to produce his diplo-
mat, and then he produced the wrong one,
who absolutely declined to act the part. As
a result the literary humorist is being pro-
secuted. A run of one day, or part of a
day, seems to be all that “The Whispering

“Oh, he quiet, do, Reggie — there’s nothing to cry about, as far as
I can see.”
“No, of course you can’t —but you’re sitting on my jam-tart.”
Gallery” had before Incredulity began to
yell in the streets, and for so elaborate a
hoax that wasn’t long. Samuel William

LINES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The world has many kinds of lines
That bind or poll apart;
But of them all there’s one that twines
Itself around the heart.
’Tis better than the lines of kings
That held their sway on earth--
It is the stout steel line that swings
A steamer to her berth.
We’ve run our lines of latitude
Along the lines of trade,
To take a liner filled with food
And bring back “lines” men made.
The lines that loving hands have penned
Still link us to our homes,
Or Lord knows what would be the end
Of every man who roams.
But now the heme port’s headland looms
Through mists of morning rolled,
And deep her throaty whistle booms
To wake the echoes bold ;
And as the engine bells are rung
It makes our gay hearts sing
To see the heaving-line far flung
To take the writhing “spring.”
“Hang on, to her,” the Old Man says
In gruff voice, up on top,
Where watchful of his ship he stays
Until he signals “Stop!”
Aye, longshoremen may sneer and scoff,
But sailormcn agree
The best line is the one sent off
To swing us in from sea.

Nineteen of the 32 poets whose work is
included in the Christmas Bulletin have
had books of their verse published, and
in one or two cases novels and dramas also.
Of the remaining bards, four have been in-
cluded in anthologies of Australian verse —
most of the 19 have also, of course, enjoyed
the same distinction. At least 10 of the
storytellers have published novels, five or
more of them have scored successes on the
stage, and the story of one of the most popu-
lar films screened in Australia was written
by a Christmas Bulletin contributor. The
coming number will contain some of the best
work any of them have ever done, and will be
published on December 11. There will be
5u per cent, more reading in it than in an
ordinary seven-and-sixpenny novel; yet the
price will be only sixpence.
Bowser will not seek re-election to the
Speakership of Vic. Assembly. If willing
to risk nomination, Lawson would be almost
certain of success, but he may have other
views. Peacock could have it. Charles
Gavan Duffy. Graham Berry, Duncan Gillies
and Watt (the last-named in the Reps.)
did not disdain to take it after holding the
Premiership. Failing these, Farthing, if he
gains a seat under the new scheme, may get
the job.
A round-the-world trip at 80 proved fatal
to Walter Forwood, the Adelaide ironmaster,
who died in Sydney on his way back from
the IJ.S.A. From the smallest beginnings
he built up the firm of Forwood, Down and
Co., finally buying out his partner and tak-
ing in his own sons, two of whom are now
managing it in Adelaide, with another at
the Wcstralian branch. Mining machinery
for the N.T. boom long ago first gave For-
wood his chance, and slater he exported to
various countries. Nearer home he made
a specialty of railway bridges. He did a
lot of public work, and had been president
of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures
of all Australia.
Most of the Diggers who went to Wey-
mouth, the half-way house to Australia, had
a prejudice against Monte Video camp, which
was further away from town than others;
but a few found a very good friend in Nelson
Moore Richardson, an enthusiastic book col-
lector, on whose estate the camp was estab-
lished. The antiquarian was always pre-
pared to act the host to Diggers who dis-
played an interest in his collections. As a
result of that war-time friendship the N.S.W.
Public Library benefits by a priceless col-
lection of old Bibles, including a copy of
the Coverdale, published in 1533. Richardson
had promised that he would make a gift of
his Bibles to Australia. It would probably
have gone to Melbourne, but librarian Ifould
wrote to Richardson before his death, a
couple of years ago, and secured the gift. The
executors are now sending the collection.
The last full-blooded member of the
Hawkesbury (N.S.W.) tribe went over the
hill recently. She was Mrs. Martha Ever-
ingham, and in so much esteem was she held
by the local white residents that a move is
being made to erect a tombstone to her
memory.
The world’s wool-buyers will feel sorry
that Walter Hill, of Christchurch (M.L.),
won’t be seen any more when the fleeces
are sent to market. He was the king-pin of
the local wool-buyers’ association for 36 years
—one of the founders. He knew wool and he
knew how to buy and sell wool. But he
won’t be remembered as a wool expert so
much as he will be kept in mind as the
exemplar of an old business school. There
was more than one occasion when Hill
had to choose between a very delicate con-
science and tremendous financial losses, but
it never occurred to him that he had any
choice. He sustained the losses and sur-
vived them. One of his hobbies was drain-
age, and for 20 years he labored to provide
the flat town in which he lived with adequate
sewerage. The local drainage board put
him in the chair in 1907, and never let him go.
“Hugh Stone”: The Rev. George Walters
had been anxious lately to get a bill through
Parliament to enable the committee of his
Hyde Park (Sydney) Unitarian Church to
dispose of the very valuable site in Liverpool-
street, and re-build elsewhere. He did not
live _ long enough to see his wish realised —-
getting out of a tram-car on the wrong side,
a motor-car ran the veteran down. The first
minister of the same church, the Rev. Pillars,
had a somewhat similar experience. When he
came to Sydney, some 60 years ago, the
Unitarians met in an old building in Mac-
quarie-street. When the Liverpool-street
block was secured, in the midst of a big
residential centre, Mr. Pillars worked hard
to rear the present structure, but before it
was ready he was found at the bottom of
the Gap—dead. How he got there was never
known. He had seen the walls of the church
go up, but never stood in its pulpit.
John Caughley, Maoriland’s Director of
Education, intends to throw up his job. He
has been a strong opponent of the introduc-
tion of the Bible into State schools, but the ,
new Minister of Education, Wright, is a
strong advocate —he was at one time organ-
iser of the Bible-in-Sehools League. So they
don’t hit it nicely at all.
It is part of the unwritten Constitution
of Maoriland that the Cabinet must always
contain at least one Maori. Maui Pomare,
who has been filling the bill ever since Bill
Massey climbed into office 14 years ago, is a
Dr. MAUI POMARE, Minister of Health
in Maoriland.
medical man by profession—he got his degree
in Chicago—and for some years he has been
Minister of Health as well as “member of
the Executive representing the native race.”
Fifty years of age, and as plump as a Maori
of that age likes to be, he sheds a ray of
geniality over Cabinet meetings. His port-
folio is not an easy one to hold, and he has
many enemies, but the fact worries him not
at all. Jellicoe slapped him on the back
with a sword four years ago, and made him
a Knight of the British Empire. He must
be about the bulkiest man in the order.
The Newtown (Sydney) Congregational
parson, Marcus Massey, preached a sermon
the other day which was heard by his brother
in San Francisco. Directly 2BL arranged
to broadcast the service, Massey arranged by
cable for his brother to listen-in at a radio
station; the next day a cable arrived an-
nouncing that the brother had heard and
been edified.
“Uramao”: The late Timi Kara’s dad
was a tough old pioneer Irishman. He was
in the service of the Government in Sydney
prior to his hopping over to Maoriland in
the ’thirties. Settled in the Wairoa district,
Joseph Carroll imported horses and ploughs
from Sydney and commenced wheat-growing;
he taught brother Maori to tackle farming,
too. As side-lines Joe ran a smithy, did
some whaling, and owned a fleet of trading
schooners. He married the chieftainess
Tapuke.
The death of W. Usher in Sydney the other
day recalls his old reefing show at Mt. Usher
(Central Q.). It was right at the head of
Crocodile Creek, scene of a riot long ago
when Chinese water-polluters were driven
out. The reef was rich enough to keep the
optimist on tiptoe for nearly 20 years, but
finally the undertaking succumbed to vanish-
ing quartz and rising costs. Within coo-ee
of Mt. Usher on the other slope of the range
was the later-day Dee rush, which yielded
some slugs worth while.
It isn’t so easy to die young in Geelong.
Morris Jacobs, aged 101, and his wife, 98,
have just celebrated the 75th anniversary of
their wedding, after spending their whole
married life in the town, and they are hale
and spry. Old Mr. Jacobs established a
clothing and drapery business in his young
manhood; and it still flourishes where it was
planted in Malop-street.
N.S.W. Labor Governments should be
chary of ex-schoolmasters. Soon after the
1910 elections the McGowen Government was
upset by the resignations of Harry Horne
and Bill Dunn, two former teachers. Now
Peter Loughlin and Vernon Goodin, M.A.,
another couple of ex-pedagogues, have forced
Lang to face the people.
Old members of Vic. Assembly recall that
F. C. Mason, then Speaker, read what he
knew was his own political death-warrant
while standing at the end of the table in
the House. It was the prorogation pro-
clamation issued by Governor Sydenham
Clarke at the instance of Irvine, the Pre-
mier. More heroic was the coming of the
desperately ill A. A. Billson to the Assembly
Chamber the other day to induce McLachlan
to pair with him on the motion for the adop-
tion of the seats scheme. As Billson’s own
electorate (Ovens) had been wiped out, in
pairing for the redistribution proposals he
had nothing to hope for. His pilgrimage to
Parliament House a little while before the
vital division was taken will be remembered
when his services as a Minister and as Chair-
man of Committees are forgotten.
When W. M. Hughes, looking for a
better ’ole, founded the National Party in
Australian politics, one of his most immedi-
ate and staunch adherents was William
Senior, a gentleman so austere in aspect and
conversation that nobody dared to call him
Bill. Senior was a storekeeper by trade,
a Primitive Methodist by religious persua-
sion, and a politician by accident. He was
a Prim, minister in his youth, but the vineyard
was barren and the flock scanty. Over 40
years ago he decided to keep store at Mount
Gambier (S.A.), but the local Methodies
never lacked a helping word so long as
Brother Senior was on hand. He sat in the
S.A. Assembly for eight years, and left that
place in 1912 to become a Senator. He was
passed out at the 1923 election and that was
liis political end. He was always on the
side of the angels, and his blameless fife
shone like an arc lamp in this naughty
world.
A syndicate, mostly of N.S.W. squatters,
has bought from the LI. V. McKay execu-
tors the Rupertswood mansion and lands at
Sunbury (Vic.), purchased by the late har-
vester king from the Clarke family. The
price was approximately £lOO,OOO. Baronet
Rupert, grandson of the founder of the
family fortunes, and his brother and step-
brothers tired of playing the squire role at
Sunbury, and scattered.
Australia has gained a V.C. by the arrival
of Captain Robert Gee, who has thrown
in his seat in the House of Commons (he
was Unionist M.P. for Boswortli) to go on
the land at Mullewa (W.A.). Gee was in
the Royal Fusiliers for 22 years before the
Great War brought his opportunity. He got
a commission in 1915, and was thereafter one
of the staff officers of the 29tli Division —
one of the divisions the Diggers held in high
regard.
E. D. A. Bagot has dropped his south-
north transcontinental motor project, after
failing to get a subsidy from the Common-
wealth Government. His two trips this year,
Adelaide to Darwin, have carried about 25
passengers, at special prices, and even so
have not paid their way. His plan for con-
tinuance was to run merely between Oodna-
datta and Emungalen, the respective rail-
heads, till the gap is filled. Lie tells Adelaide
interviewers that it seems probable that
aeroplanes will be carrying mails about the
N.T. long before the completion of the line.
J. T. LET, a
former N.B.W.
Minister for
Justice, now a
member of the
Federal House,
who broke the
monotony of the
long recess by
opening an exhi-
bition of the new
Photofilm in
Sydney last
week.
Lewis Chant was one of Victoria’s useful
pioneers. He was the first contractor in the
Western district to introduce the eight-
hour day, the 10-hour day being usual
then, and he had to face strong disapproval.
He ploughed the first block of the now fam-
ous Cororooke onion land, using a bullock-
team; and later bought a large part of the
estate he had worked for. He died at
Warrion the other day at 78.
FAME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“When Mr. Bruce received, an honorary doctorate
at Oxford he listened to a long peroration in Latin
in which reference was made to his having rowed in
a victorious Cambridge eight. ‘Frankly, gentlemen,’
said Mr. Bruce later, T am getting a bit tired of
being told about that. Somehow I imagined 1 had
progressed a bit since then; but, no, the best you
can find is that I rowed with Cambridge.’ ’’
Heroes of men of war
And diplomats who plot, and plan
Arc shining lights from shore to shore.
In chronicles our scholars scan
Their doings since the world began.
But, such is my unhappy fate,
I’m but remembered as the man
\Vho rowed once in the Cambridge Eight.
In vain I rise and hold the floor.
What use to solve, as well I can,
Grave Empire problems, ponder o’er
The raisin slump, the price of branl
I hear some low-browed charlatan
With lend guffaws annunciate
The' subject that I’d ever ban,
I rowed once in the Cambridge Eight.
They praise me not as conqueror,
As fashion’s leader, spick and span.
They only know I pulled an oar
When Oxford rivals also ran.
They blazon it in Latin, an
Excuse made for my doctorate.
That’s all they seem to know of Stan—
He rowed once in the Cambridge Eight.

No critic or historian
Says that I steered the Ship of State,
Or finds more in my record than
I rowed once in the Cambridge Eight.

“Nuces”: The story told by “Bill" (B.
21/10/’26) reminds me of an old galali I
knew years ago. This bird threw in his lot
with the domestic fowls and ignored all the
attempts of free parrots to lure him away.
No rooster showed such elation at the laying
of an egg as this fellow. He perched along-
side a laying hen, and the noise of his cackle
at her successful effort drowned her own jubi-
lation. The affairs of the nest occupied most
of liis waking moments, and at night he
roosted in the fowl-house. His favorite lien
was an old white leghorn, and he survived
her death only a few days, having enjoyed
34 years of life.

“TamornieV: No need to go to the East
Indies to see giant monitor lizards. Centralia
has huge specimens up to Oft. long. The
stubby legs which carry the body about nine
inches above the ground are as thick as the
forearm of a big man. The natives out near
the heads of the Field and Marshall call
them printas. On the three occasions I have
seen them, the black boys would not dis-
mount to tackle them, claiming that they
themselves would be killed. I didn’t insist
on having their theory tested.
‘.‘Bcndee”: I can endorse “G.S.M.’s.”
views (B. 4/11/’26) on the attitude of cattle
to a defunct brother. It is my misfortune to
use a lot of blood-and-bone fertiliser, and I
have always found that even the most timid
milker will follow me round while the stuff
is on me, trying to lick my arms and clothes.
Leave a bag of B. and B. about where there
are cows, and they will invariably crowd
round and lap the smellful stuff up like
mother’s milk. They do not get nearly so
excited about plain bonedust. Curiously,
horses are usually correspondingly shy of the
stuff, and one of my prads which has been
among it for years has never overcome his
fear of the “dead" smell, and is like a corn-
fed two-year-old if there is a bag of it in the
cart behind him.

“Vorley”: On a recent trip through the
Nebo district (C.Q.) I came across our old
enemy the crow being treated as an honored
guest at the sta-
ti o n homesteads.
On asking why, I
was informod that
the black one was
a champion tick-
destroyer. lie con-
siders himself quite
a friend of the
family, and caws
gently on the back-
door step. Beyond
taking an occa-
sional chicken or
young turkey to
show there is still
a spark of devil-
ment left in him,
his behavior i s
admirable, and he
is well established
in his office of
honorary tick-
destroyer. In the
Cairns and Innis-
fail districts the
Indian minali was
introduced as a
tick opponent, and
fully justifies its
importation. It is multiplying rapidly, and
groups of the birds are often seen perched on
cattle and horses working overtime at tick-
harvesting.

“8.W.R.”: Re the 2ft. Gin. death-adder
referred to by “Fitz” (B. 11/11/’26). In
tlie South Burnett district (Q.) about 14
years ago I was on a scrub selection about
10 miles from Wondai. and saw more than
one adder killed there that measured 2ft. Gin.
The best specimen measured 2ft. lOlin. I
killed it myself, and was so impressed by its
size that I carried it half a mile to get its
figures exact.
“Colorado” : I was teaching on the Naip-
bucca (N.S.W.) in 1912, and witnessed the
despatch of an enormous death-adder by a
cow-cocky. It measured 2ft. B|in. —which
measurement I verified when I arrived at
school. A note of his size, etc., I placed in
the nature-section of my lesson-register for
that week, and I also made a note of the
adventure in my diary. I had intended to
preserve the brute, but he was too bruised to
make a good specimen. Incidentally, when
first struck by the sulky-whip the adder
sprang at least 4ft. straight upwards before
making a half-hoop.
“Bongo” : On my property at Murgon (Q. )
I killed a death-adder which, in the presence
of three witnesses, taped 2ft. I well
mind an interesting circumstance connected
with this ivirticular reptile. Fastened just
behind the head was a large engorged tick,
which I removed and placed in a tin match-
box and kept under observation. Soon
numerous eggs were laid, from which in a
week or two a thousand or so young ticks
were hatched. I thought it was time then
to consign box and brood to the kitchen fire.
The incident was oi special interest, in view
of the fact that at the time the Stock Depart-
ment was engaged in one of its periodical
outbursts of activity in the “cleansing” of
certain pastoral areas from cattle-ticks, and
STILL ANOTHER DRAWBACK.
WINIFRED: “Mummy, I don’t fink the angels like these hush fires.”
MOTHER: “Why, darling?”
WINIFRED : “Oh, they mus’ smoke Heaven out awfully.”
ono of the arguments used by penalised stock-
owners against the invariably abortive opera-
tion was that ticks were carried by marsu-
pials anjß.snakes. It is, however, only fair
to’,say that the mother of the large family
above referred to was a scrub- and mot a
cattle-tick.
“Alastor” : At the Shamrock Hotel, Drill-
ham ((}.'), in one day three 2ft. Tin. death-
adders were killed ; one was on the tick of 2ft.
lOin. The longest one I’ve met was a Chin-
chilla (s.-w. Q.) brute, which when taped
by Mr. Ferrier, of Iloma, ticked oil' 2ft. llin.
South-western Queensland, between Roma and
Dalby, is the adders’ champion breeding
ground.
“Bendee” : In 1912 at Oakey (Q.) I slew a
“deafy” on a blacksoil flat, which measured,
as near as I could get it, 3ft. 3in. (I hadn’t a
tape-measure,, and couldn’t carry the worm
with me; ,but I checked my standards after-
wards.) About three weeks later, at Wlieel-
don’s scrub .farm at Muldu, 17 miles away,
during a picnic lunch one of the girls casually
remarked, “There’s a snake,” as a big adder
crawled out from under the tablecloth round
which we were sitting. He was duly
“donged,” and was the length of two kero-
sene-tins, plus the width of one; and that is
3ft. Ifin. as near as you can get it. Thi’ee
days after this Kelly brothers killed the
ringer at their selection, half a mile away.
This specimen was 3ft. sin. They had a
tape there.
* * * #
“Centre”: Poultry-farming on the N.S.W.
South Coast line has its drawbacks. Sixty-
one nine-months-old leghorn
fowls were destroyed during
one night by foxes in my
next-door neighbor’s run
recently, and another man
lost 53 on another night.
Foxes will clear a sft. wire-
netting fence apparently
without difficulty, and get
aw T ay with what they want.
But it is the wanton destruc-
tion they delight in that
causes such serious losses; a
fowl stolen now and then
would be bad enough, but
could be tolerated till the
cause of it was poisoned.
These brutes kill for the love
of killing, and the mutilated
bodies of the birds, scattered
all over the run, show the
manner in which they are
hunted and worried before
being killed by having their
heads bitten off. Crows, too,
take their toll of both
chickens and eggs. Their
habit of planting partly-
eaten eggs under cover of
dry cow-manure, strips ■of
stringy bark, etc., is being
taken advantage of by some
farmers, who put poison in
the hidden stores- —when they
can find them—and the birds
generally fall to the baits when returning to
finish their stored feed.
* * * *
“Cuchulain”: Re “Herodot’s” farmer (B.
11/11/’26) whose car was pursued by
dingoes. Dingoes will chase any vehicle,
though what their motives are no one seems
to have found out. Pioneers tell of many a
dingo that has followed behind the buggy
for mile after mile, yet never attempting to
harm its occupants. Two old friends of mine
were doing a long trip along the Moonee
ltiver (Q.) in their buggy years ago, when
everyone travelled that way. Late in the
afternoon they chanced to glance behind
them and saw some yards to their rear,
right in their dust, a big brindled dingo com-
ing on steadily. He followed for about three
miles, when they stopped and cracked the
whip. He turned back, but soon took up the
chase again. There was no more formidable
weapon in the buggy than an axe, but one
got out of the trap with it and hid behind
a tree. The dingo with set gaze went on
after the buggy, and got the shock of his
life when the axe descended on his neck.
The aim was slightly crooked, owing to the
executioner’s desire to get safely back to the
buggy, and Warrigal merely staggered; his
hair along the back stood up and he snarled
nastily, but slunk away.
* * * *
“Bar Iv.” : If “White Lyon” (B. 4/11/’26)
travelled north a few miles to the Moonee
River (Q.) he would find wild pigs which,
like those referred to by “Rizzle” (B.
7/lu/’26), have retained a good type through
many years of “bush.” If caught young and
fed up, they will make excellent bacon. I
recall a selector's kid on old Tartha station
wlio made a pet of a nuggcty slip that became
so tame that it would follow him up to
four or five miles through the bush, and
always return home, even though it passed
the haunts of its ancestors en route. The fact
that it was a confirmed bachelor may have
helped in this. Of course there are some
rough sorts among these pigs, but they are
far superior to those found along the Mcln-
tyre. I nominate the Galong (N.S.W.)
DESPERATE MEASURES.
MUM: “You're not going to shave, Dad, surely!”
DAD: “ Ain't I! They’ve entered me to ride at the picnic
races, an’ I goiter get me weight down some’ow.”
“brumbies” as the ugliest and worst pigs
in Australia, beating the Mclntyre grunters
by at least half a snout. But even a stud
pig will look herring-gutted and leggy if
left to fossick for himself from infancy.
THE LIARS OF THE BUSH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Where the camp-tire stabs the darkness and the bush-
men congregate,
Where the talk goes up from horses to the high affairs
of State,
It is there you’ll find the members of a stern
and serious push.
It’s a quite distinguished Order: The Men Who
Know the Bush.
Doesn’t matter what the fuel —mulga, mallee, jarrah,
gum—
Doesn’t matter where you’re going, doesn't matter
whence you’ve come,
Be they navvies, shearers, splitters ranged within
the camp-fire’s light,
You can bet on finding someone who can always put
you right.
Round the camp-fires of the Bushland when the
hours of toil are done
All the “special inside stories,” as the papers say,
are spun.
ji is there you, meek and humble, pay the homage
Truth exacts,
As you hear the proper version from a man who
knows the facts.
There you learn the tale you cherish and the yarn
that you repeat
Is a gross exaggeration, or in all things incomplete.
Age itself is not respected; there’s no pity shown
to youth,
For the camp-fire of the Bushland is the altar-fire of
Truth.
“PARTING IS SUCH SWEET
SORROW.”
PRISONER: “Lemme lash th’ missish go’-bye.”
POLICEMAN: “ Gome on. I’ll attend to that
later.”
There the bards and story-writers are put firmly in
their place,
For the Bushman at the camp-fire feels in duty bound
to trace
Incidents they stated wrongly, facts important that
they hid—
Ah ! they all know more than Lawson, more than
Banjo ever did.
Round the camp-fires of Australia they are sitting
night by night
Building, blasting reputations, sorting out, and
setting right;
And as long as sparks fly upward, and as long as
camp-fires glow,
There will never be a shortage of the *uen who
know they know.
And we who’re sure of nothing, and who view all
things with doubt,
Well for us if we could follow these grand men of
Further Out,
Could we find such faith as they have, could we
emulate that push;
The great everlasting Order of the Liars of the
Bush.

“Wingella” : Merino rams may be good as
watchdogs (B. 5/8/’26), but one would go
far to beat an emu at the game. Owe I
remember announced the coming of ’Visi-
tors by a prolonged drumming that could- be
heard all over the neighborhood. Upon one
“GOT A (HIC) HATCH ON YER, MATE?”
occasion a thief thought the house would
repay looting. He was just congratulating
himself when something gripped his right ear
and nearly screwed it off his head. His yells
of agony brought the man of the house on
the scene, to discover that the burglar had
been captured by the emu, and it took some
persuasion to compel the bird to release its
captive.
* * * *
“Langaloh” : “Innisfailure” (B. 21/10/’26)
relates that a Swiss mate of his in Queens-
land asked him why “the Australian inven-
tioir’ was not used there in taking cart-
loads of cane down steep hills. I claim to
have been the inventor of the contrivance
referred to. It is used to lift up the front
of a loaded dray by a ratchet attached to the
pole and body, the pole being hinged on to
the axle.
“The Rumpus”:
I have watched as
many as four
young queen bees
in a hive, and
when the One most
matured got with-
in known distance
of the day of con-
sent the drones be-
gan to take inter-
est. From a lighter
color she quickly
developed a darK
hue, an d each
morning at dawn
went for a little
training in the way
of flight, a number
of dron e s, like
racecourse - touts,
following her. On
her nuptial morn-
ing she flew straight
out on the wings
of dawn, with about
50 drones after her,
up, up, out of
sight. An hour
later she returned
to the hive with a
portion of the con-
sort who flew the
f wiftest in pursuit
still adhering to
her. Impregnated
t lius, she now
waited a suitable
warm day to
swarm out with the
young bees of her
age. In succes-
sion this process
was repeated by
the other queens as
they matured, the
youngest and last
remaining in the
old home, the worn-out mother-queen being
stung to death.
“H.E.R.”: Pipes may draw well for 45
years, but what about the good old gamp
that has kept the rain off for as long or
longer? Every working day that looks at
all threatening I see an old brolly faithfully
carried by the man who bought it in 1881.
It has been re-covered only three times since:
once, it is claimed by the owner, a future
Prime Minister of Australia did the job.
* * * *
“J.H.S.” : In 20 years I have never known
a solitary specimen of the “light-headed” flying-
fox enter our orchard, although for lengthy
periods each year millions
are camped within coo-ee of
it. The robber has always
been Gould’s fox ( Pteropus
gouldi), a somewhat larger
animal than the grey-liead
and nearly black in color.
This year local (S.Q.) fruit-
growers were particularly
troubled by flying-foxes, the
pests raiding the. orchards
nightly, and destroying and
knocking down large quanti-
ties of fruit, including man-
goes, peaches, guavas, mul-
berries, pawpaws, oranges
and mandarins. More of the
marauders were slaughtered
than ever before, the un-
lucky ones being chiefly preg-
nant females, and all of
them were Goulds. Through-
out the citrus season, mil-
lions of the grey-heads were
camped in the district, pass-
ing- over orchards laden with
the golden fruit each even-
ing, but not in one instance
did they offer to molest the
crop. Fruitgrowers in differ-
ent districts should first
ascertain which of the five
species of fox is worrying
them before setting out on
an organised destruction
campaign; then the battues
which take place from time
to time might show beneficial results.
* * * *
“Wilga” : Three kinds of cuckoos are com-
mon on the tablelands of N. S. Wales, and
two of thdta particularly so. All this spring
they have been numerous. Tlie most common
variety is the large bronze. It flies from
tree to tree uttering its mournful note and
looking out for an unguarded starling’s nest.
The starlings frequently give chase, prob-
ably thinking the bird a hawk. The little
bronze cuckoo is also frequently seen and
heard, though when seeking a nest it is very
silent. One of them placed its egg in a
wren’s nest not ten yards from my window.
The rarest cuckoo is liglit-grey and mottled
like a Plymouth Rock chicken. It is a slow-
moving and sulky bird —indeed, so sulky as
to give one the impression that it is a
creature of the night, and ought not, there-
fore, to be disturbed by day.
MILITANT CHRISTIANITY.
“Been in the wars, Maister?”
“ 'E’s like this, m’ son. We ded ’ave a bit av discussion up chapel
laast night on ‘how to promote the work av grace,’ an’ a few
av us cudden see eye to eye ’bout it.”
“Akran”: The annual sports at Slap Up
were in progress, and Dad Hayrick had just
annexed the caber-tossing. Then came the
beer-race. Dad was a warm favorite, for
hadn’t he won this event “five years in
concussion,” as he used to remind them?
The idea was to sprint 50 yards, drink a pint
oi beer and run back. Dad won his heat.
In tlie final he was in the next track to
Murphy. The latter got so excited in run-
ning that he forgot to swallow his beer.
Dad didn’t, but sank Murphy’s also, and then
won the race by a j ard. Murphy shook hands
with his conqueror, and then remarked,
“Well, I’m entitled to me beer, anyhow, so
I’ll go back fer it.” “Too late, me man,” said
Dad, “I dhrunk it.” That’s what the fight
was about.
“Gouger” : In the Gulf country the niggers’
greatest spirit, apart from the one of whom
they will only speak in whispers, is Takakan.
He dwells in the deepest waterholes, passing
from one to the other in the. form of a rain-
bow. He can kill at a glance, can level
mountains and flood the plains with water.
But to the possessor of the power of magic
he is always a friend. Witch-doctors occa-
sionally renew their
sorcery by having
converse with
Takakan. They go
to sleep by one of
his waterholes, and
a numbing sensa-
tion creeps over
their bodies. It is
then that he takes
the abo. in his
arms and carries
him to the bottom
of the hole. With-
drawing part of
the natural life, he gives in its place an
essence that produces a wonderful power. A
witch-doctor who has been initiated thus by
Takakan is universally dreaded.
“J.S.L.”: “Ajax” (B. 8/7/’26) has never
lived in the N.T., or he would not want to
know if abos. could whistle. They can, most
decisively; whistle quite as well 'as the white
man can. Come to that, I know quite a
number of white men who can’t whistle; no
amount of trying can ever teach them how to
do it. There’s a whole family of, young lads
I know who can’t whistle a note, but who
would give half their wages if they could.
But most of their nigger acquaintances can
and do whistle remarkably well.
* * * #
“Wang”: The district where I spent my
boyhood boasted something unique in the way
of fences. The exhibit was about half a mile
long, and consisted of posts and six strands
of wire. The posts were the butts of young
stringybarks that had had their tops chopped
off about sft. from the ground. The paddock
had been cleared of all other timber. The
butt-s were ringbarked to prevent them sprout-
ing again, and in a few years’ time the hearts
at the tops rotted away. Seeds of various
kinds, blown into the cavities by the wind
or carried there by birds, took root and
sprouted, and in a few years the fence
presented a quaint sight. Thistles reared
themselves heavenwards from some of the
posts, whilst others foster-parented wild
cherries, mistletoe, supplejack and half a
dozen other kinds of plant-life. A bush-fire
eventually demolished what had become one
of the shows of the place.
* * * *
“W.8.H.”: Does “F.S.S.” (B. 14/10/’26)
class Australian pastoralists with double-
headed fools when he says that they have
taken no thought of economising with salt-
bush. I wonder how long is it since he
travelled a Western Division station in
N.S.W.? I’ve been through five in the last
three months, and on each one the lessee was
spelling the saltbush and noting with satis-
faction that it was coming along well after
the strain of last year. California is wise
to import the seed of this wonderful plant,
but I can assure “F.S.S.” that lie needn’t
start to teach the Australian squatter to
squat.
* * * #
“Bad Australian”: Does the present-day
swagman or the man from Outback who
hangs cork on his hat really use full-sized
beer or champagne-stoppers, as depicted by
Tom Glover and Oswald Pryor? Wells
decorates his buslimen and State Premiers
in the same way. The mob I ran with in
the bad old days usually fabricated a com-
plete fiy-screen from one or at most two
corks cut in sections about the thickness
of sole-leather. In all my peregrinations
out back I never saw a hat with full-sized
corks suspended from it. Has the old order
really changed, and, if so, whaffor?
■** * *
“Lacn”: Our country gun club, the mem-
bership of which is composed solely of
wheat cockies, long ago abandoned shooting
from traps of domesticated pigeons, and
turned its attention to starlings and
sparrows. These having become scarce in
the district, a substitute was found necessary
for the Saturday-afteruoon sweepstakes. At
the last competition crows were released
from the traps, and although a bit slow on
the rise and a good-sized _ target, a fair
percentage were able to avoid the shooters’
aim. But our trouble is to catch the wily
birds. How can it be done?
* * * *
“Ramlila” : I back Johnston grass for sheer
tenacity. Originally introduced into Fiji for
fodder ' purposes, it rapidly got out of hand,
and now covers hundreds of acres of culti-
vated country from which so far it has been
found impossible to eradicate it. As an
experiment a small area of land containing
this grass was fenced in and used for some
years as a cattle-pen. By the end of the
time the ground was packed hard to the
density of cement, and no blade of grass
had been seen on it for two years. The
HIS DAY’S GOOD DEED.
MOTORIST: “How far to the pub?”
THIRSTY SWAGGIE : “About half a mile. But
I better come back an’ show yer — it’s a
bit tricky to find.”
fence was then removed, the land ploughed
up, and within a few days after the first
shower of rain it was covered with a beauti-
ful crop or young Johnston grass. Besides
propagating by seed, , this grass travels
under the surface, putting out shoots from
the joints in the root-branches, so that even
if the roots are chopped up by ploughs each
segment will produce a plant to in turn
multiply in the same way.
A BALLAD OF ST. PEWTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Longjaw Lang and Theodore and Walsh have
done their worst,
And Bolshevik Bohemia is .a. bubble on the burst,
When business is failing ar.vi the cash is getting
scanty,
And people give up flash hotels and take to hut
and shanty,
What is it recks not of ths. times, what stands
from year to year?
Why, ’tis the noble, nerve-ref lushing, national taste
for beer!
When stone from stone shall totter down and homes
in ruin fall,
And palaces lie prostrate ’neatli the flying cannon-
ball,
And factories and offices and hi,Th cathedral steeple
Come tumbling down like hailstones on the horror-
stricken people,
What will be standing yet, wlt'en gone are office,
home and club?
Why, ’tis the indispensable, inoffensive corner pub.
And when at last the Aral trump shall sound o’er
all the earth
And Judgment Day wipe out all claims of wealth
and rank and birth;
When prigs and wowsers, prawns , ;and pimps are
drafted in as stokers,
And up to Heaven and repose go 'hookies, lawyers,
brokers,
What amid all the hastening feeti will every true
man think?
Why, he will cry: “Before we leave lest’s have another
drink!”
And when, above, the blessed ones reciline in glorious
ease
With golden haloes on their heads amd harps upon
their knees,
And as they sit and smoke cigars and talk about
the turf,
And hear the combers crooning from the local stretch
of surf,
While Paul and Peter gamble on the 'likelihood of
rain,
What will they slake their dry throats with ? Why,
nineteen-four champagne !
But down below, where parsons toil and; shovel in
the heat
And playful little imps drop burning Goals upon
their feet,
At midday in the summer time, when things are at
their worst,
And in their parched and burning throats feel
the fearful thirst,
Old Nick will murmur gently: “Oh, my coalie friends,
I fear
You much regret the awful day you cursed the name
of Beer!” _

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
SILK
STOCKINGS
The really correct art gathering of last
week was the show at the Grosvenor Gal-
leries. Her State Ex., in wide-brimmed mil-
linery and damson-toned silks, arrived on
the doormat at three to say her opening
piece, and found the two rooms crowded
with the seekers after light—art or lime.
Lady de Chair’s speech was mostly an
appeal for an establishment which might
develop a distinct school of art; and after
applause had rounded off her words, the
second lion of the afternoon mounted the
rostrum.
A gasp of admiration fluttered from the
group, and then was replaced by fascinated
silence. The speaker was ITofessor Rad-
cliffc-Brown, who occupies the new chair of
anthropology at Sydney Uni. He is a Cam-
bridge product, and only Max Beerbolim
could do credit to him. He is tall, sinuous,
beautiful to behold, Savile-row tailored, and,
since the shearing of the silky-black beard
he sported when in Australia some years ago,
might easily replace Theda Bara on the
movies. However, his theories on art sounded
plausible, but his frequent reference to the
exhibitors as “these young people” must have
amazed visitors who recognised on the walls
names of long acquaintanceship. To the
housewife the most haunting thing in the ex-
hibition was Lambert’s cauliflower. So real it
was that it might have been labelled “Direct
from studio to consumer.” In another pic-
ture Mr. Lambert shows himself scattered
about in detached fragments—no doubt a
suggestion for flat-dwellers. Roy de Mestre
came in for a few kind words from the Pro-
fessor, and Kenneth Macqueen, the Queens-
land artist of imagination, came in for a
good deal of praise from everybody who
looked upon his work. Ken was feeling
good because his best-girl, Olive Crane, not
long back from Europe, stood beside him
during a voile;, of congratulations on their
engagement.
The State Governor and his lady served
good music and champagne cup to a multi-
tude of the Mixed Arts at Government House
last Thursday evening. Consuls were there,
too, and men of great learning, and many
ladies who toil not nor spin, but beside whose
raiment the lily of the field would wither
with envy. For instance, take the diamonds
of James Fairfax’s lady (if you wish to be
truly intimate you call her Lady Jim) : the
lily before mentioned* might have mistaken
them for dewdrops, and smiled at them as
at an old friend. Lady de Chair’s jewels
also must not be overlooked, and a slim
baud of diamonds', called attention to her
pretty hair. Silver sequins glittered against
the gold lame and lace of her frock. During
the long handshake she was supported by
Sir Dudley, who wore his bright smile and
the look of shining cleanliness for which he
has won renown. Daughter Elaine added
a flutter of flame georgette flounces to the
horizon, and the Macartliui* Onslows’ Eliza-
beth, in almond greens, and Kathleen Robin-
son, in a fragile alliance 'of peach chiffons
and diamentes, were other? young things to
be noticed.
Thanksgiving Day and/the 40th anniver-
sary of the wedding of the U.S.A. Consular
Lawton couple jostled each other last week,
and the. American colony had a great time
of it airing its ermines and pearls. The
Consul and his lady made the first splash
in the Thanksgiving ceremonial by holding a
monster party at the Rose Bay Golf Club.
To this came vice-royalty in the person of
Lady de Chair and daughter Elaine, the Con-
suls of every country and a vast concourse
of the limousined and' marcelled, both Aus-
tralian and American./ The Golf Club, with
its far-flung harbor vbaws, is always a happy
spot for a party, and for this occasion Was
banked with beautiful flowers. The feature
of the evening wasi'a film showing, Mr. and
Mrs. Lawton as babies, then as they were
when Cupid made/them his target, at their
wedding, and as fthey are to-day after 40
years of matrimcyny. The last seemed an
outstanding reasorn why girls should marry.
Then “Beaij Geste” had its first release in
Sydney, ar/d Mrs. Lawton smiled above a
frock of b/lack (and gold lace at the thrills
that stirred her guests while the dashing
story wa.fi,. unfolded.
That great home industry of America, the
punkin/pie, was in evidence at the Went-
worth/the other night? when the American
Society celebrated Thanksgiving with a grand
lcnife-and-fork hallelujah. From his exalted
station on the platform an enormous turkey,
surrounded by little turkeys and piles of
pumpkins and wheat stacks, watched the
revels, which he seemed to think were
entirely in his honor. All America was pre-
sent, and sitting under the united folds of
the Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack
were the president of the society and the
Consular Lawtons. The frocking was beau-
tiful, and every woman present wore that
expensive look that is the lot of every Ameri-
can man’s wife and daughter. All the old-
time American tunes that we got used to
when Uncle Sam’s Navy was here were
served with the glad meats, and presently
a line of just-made-in-America jazz ushered
in the really important part of the enter-
tainment.
The Limbless Soldiers’ Association, which
has done a remarkable amount of good work
for the men who are its special charge, lately
got together a meeting at the Australia; and
as a result the limbless men are likely to
have a provident fund as well as swimming-
baths of their own. For the provident fund,
which will be used to supplement the pen-
sions of the men when they are unable to
work, £50,000 is spoken of as a nucleus;
and one estate may provide a large slice of
the money. The idea of the club-house and
baths is to provide a place where the ex-
Diggers who dislike exposing their scars to
the curious will be able to enjoy themselves
quietly.
Scots’ Church, on Church Hill, was full of
ghosts on Sunday when the last sermon was
preached inside its grey old walls. On Tues-
day, which was St. Andrew’s Day, the auld
kirk was handed over to the demolishers —
it has to make way for the new city railway.
The kirk was opened by Dr. Lang on July 10,
1826, and its congregation has sat under only
five ministers. Lang preached there for 52
years, and his daughter was at the last
service.
The World, the Flesh and the Devil
couldn’t have found the smallest dug-out to
crawl into the other afternoon at Moore Col-
lege, for canons and other heavy artillery
of the Church, under the generalship of Arch-
gaiters Wright, were an army of occupation.
The old-established Theological College (Arch-
deacon Boyce was one of its students) was
marking the calendar with still another Com-
mem., and had bidden both clergy and laity
to the jubilation. Archdeacon Davies, the
college principal, sent out an SOS for funds,
and proudly stated that 17 of Moore’s fishers
of men had qualified at the examination set
by the Australian School of Theology. Tea
on the lawn concluded the afternoon.
There is nobody more widely known in
the Sydney art world than the lady of this
photograph, and although she has never
painted a pic-
ture she has
sold hundreds.
She is Jessie
Cole, and for
the past de-
cade she has
been associated
with almost
every big art
show in the
city. Some-
times she has
managed the
exhibitions,
but oftener she
has been the
woman - assist-
ant. Royal
Art, Society
of Artists and
one-man shows
have all run
smoothly un-
der her guid-
ing' hand, and she lias an encouraging way
of helping a hesitating buyer make up his
mind that has turned many a cheque towards
the man behind the palette. At present Miss
Cole is associated with Rlioda Wager.
Those two great workers for the Ashfield
Infants’ Home, Professor MacCallum’s lady
and Professor Mills, were whirled into happi-
ness last week when the new wing of the
Home had its christening party. These two
—she with her sympathy, he with his medi-
cal advice—have done untold service in the
matter of making better babies for the best
country in the world. The new wing, which
is the concrete form of the Home’s golden
jubilee, was introduced by Professor Mills
to the big gathering as the Dame Rachel
Forster. His coadjutor referred to it as a
dream come true; and leader of the Opposi-
tion Bavin took his gaze off Mr. Lang for
an hour or two to cheer the Home on to still
higher things. The new wing is a two-
storey building, the ward on the ground floor
divided into cubicles just big enough for a
mother and her baby. Hot and cold water
everywhere and special baths for babies are
features of the building. The Trollope Ward
(named after the first matron) has been
so massaged and creamed that it looks like
a very new instead of a very old part of
the establishment. This is now a nursery
for young ladies and gentlemen of three or
four years, and tells a fairy tale all around
its apricot walls.
Eric G. Thompson, who looks out of this
picture, is one of Sydney’s promising young
architects. The other day, along with Eric
Cooper, he
held a show of
pencil and
pen - and - ink
sketches, and
amazed the
visitor with
the delicacy of
his work.
Many of the
sketches were
of Nou m e a,
and were so
full of tropi-
cal atmosphere
that the elec-
tric fans had
to be kept in
constant
action. He is
the winner of
the Howard
Joseland prize
for which all
begin ning-
architects of N. S. Wales compete. He
started working life as a caricaturist on
the Cumberland Argus, is now off to study
in America, and hopes to design some of this
city’s most noble edifices in days to come.
The Society of Australian Composers and
Authors, which held a corroboree at the
Lyceum Club last week, seems to have,more
music than ink on its members’ roll. The
programme arranged by William Asprey was
all home-grown and contained much that was
appealing and nothing that was too modern
to be understood. Norbert Wentzell, Charles
Davis and Esther Kahn supplied the instru-
mental literature, and the song-writers were
Mrs. Weatherill and Tessie Marshall. The
first lady’s “Call of the Bush” was sung by
sweet-voiced Mary MacCormick, from Maori-
land, while Charles Snodgrass put the right
note into the second writer’s “If I Had
You !” Poems by Mary Gilmore and Dulcie
Deamer were read by Grace Stafford. Alfred
Hill was the lion of the evening.
It is a good thing that happiness springs
in the heart. So the blue bird which was
invoked on their behalf by jazzers at the
Wentworth the other night will be known
by the little deaf and dumb and blind child-
ren of Darlington, even though some may
never hear his song and some may never
glimpse his outstretched pinion. To the
energetic Nathalie Rosenwax goes the credit
of organising the first dance ever held for
the Darlington Institution, and in gold and
black lace she rallied her forces, and enter-
tained an outsize party of which Mayoress
Cecilia Walsh, in a souffle of powder-blue
georgettes and silver lace, was the principal
guest. A sale of novelties and dancing com-
petitions were money-spinners of the evening.
The Arthur Scott. Harold Earlam, Herman
Slade and E. Jackson matrons were among
those who worked hard and hostessed parties,
and Muriel Bourne, the secretary, rested her
pen-hand lightly in the palms of jazz-part-
ners for the duration of the dance.
The first Father Christmas of 1926 de-
scended into the Ambassadors for the Yule-
tide Cabaret. He came in the interests of
St. Vincent’s, and consented to be the sub-
ject of a guessing competition, for which a
hamper stocked with turkey and ham was
to be the prize. Finally he was found to
be an actor in disguise—Frederick Bentley,
in short, of the “Rose Marie” company.
Literally hundreds of woman crowded and
squeezed on to the floor and danced gaily
the afternoon through, and in the day’s
humidity the intent listener could just about
hear the little fat she had melting rapidly.
Mrs. Sydney Quinlan was treasurer of the
success.
The Scott Fells had another sumptuous
wedding in the family last Saturday night.
This time the M.L.A. escorted daughter
Linda May up the aisle of St. Stephen’s to
the strategic point where Lieutenant-Colonel
Harry Lambert Wheeler, of Newcastle,
awaited her. Never has the Phillip-street
church been more lavishly decorated, white
and pink gladioli and November lilies raising
stately heads above the friendly gaze of
daisies and carnations. Between an avenue
of tall wands and trailing foliage and blos-
som the bride’s old-ivory georgettes and lace
murmured. An unexpected ending was the
powder-blue hem, and points to be remem-
bered were the train of tulle and pearls, lent
by sister Mrs. Bouverie Anderson Stuart,
and the Brussels lace veil loaned by the
Anderson Stuart lady. There were three
’maids and five trainbearers, whose tender
blues and silver contrasted with their sheaves
of pink gladioli. Guy Littler best-manned.
The Wentworth was the storm centre of
the congratulation typhoon, and here Mrs.
Etherington, another of the bride’s sisters,
steered the social barque while everyone
looked after his own bite.
The old Anglican Church at Canberra had
something more heartening than its grave-
stones to gaze on last Saturday. Up its
pine-bordered path a bride stepped to its
ivied doorway. She was Marjorie Ryrie,
twin daughter of the Major-General Ryrie
couple of Miclielago. The young man who
waited to take her for better or worse was
I'at John Brian Osborne, eldest son of the
Harry Osbornes, of Currandooley. The
bride’s satin frock was of the early Vic-
torian period—very tight as to bodice, and
spreading as to its ankle-length skirts. The
Hotel Canberra was the mustering-place for
nearly 200 guests, many of whom had tra-
velled up from Sydney.
St. Stephen’s blessed another pretty bride
last week when Cora McCulloch, of Carra-
thool and Manly, flashed her Mechlin lace
with its gold traceries, her yellow roses and
her golden streamers up its well-worn aisle.
F. D. Beer claimed the lady, who was sup-
ported by a bevy of pretty ’maids, and
Padre W. Robertson made the twain one.
Bride’s mother and father later on super-
vised the distribution of the wedding meats
at the Australia.
A wedding- that tangled up two old Yass
families brought the entire district to St.
Element’s Church midway through last week.
The bride was Sheila Richmond Whytt,
daughter of the David Whytts, of Bennochy
station, and the young man Roland Fore-
man Flail, of Yeumburra station. The bride,
who was handed by father to the altar
through a burst of choral music and an
avenue of yellow and white blossom, carried
against her white georgette and Chantilly
lace a sheaf of yellow roses and cream gladi-
oli. Yellow was worn by her three ’maids
in tones of primrose and daffodil and butter-
cup, and two small trainbearers swung golden
baskets against their fragile whiteness. The
Yass Memorial Hall decked itself in scarlet
and white for the reception.
The entente between two lots of Kirri-
billi flats has been consolidated by .an engage-
ment-ring. The pretty wearer thereof is
Althea Walder, who lives in the water-front
flats named after her father, who built them;
and the man in the case is Keith Pitt, who
lives opposite to Admiralty House gates.
Margaret Windeyer, one of Sydney’s first
women librarians, retired last week from
her job in the Mitchell. Miss Windeyer
specialised in firsts, and this Letter told of
her pioneer work in women’s movements
early this year.
Miss Brisbane’s jottings
Lieut.-Gov. Lennon opened a garden f6te at All
Hallows’ in aid of the Nazareth Home. Mrs. Lennon,
in nut-brown satin, came too, and a bunch of red
roses was given her by Marie Brophy.
The Culpins had a river picnic for Irene Smith,
who weds on December 2, aboard their yacht Pene-
lope, and the sailing races were followed. Doris
Waraker has also been having pre-wedding parties,
one at the Bellevue, in the grey salon, amongst
shasta daisies, when Rose Doak and May Moxon
poured the tea, and another given by Jeanette
Fullarton at Whyteclilfe, which included tennis,
with roses dressing up the reception-rooms. Millie
Baker, another bride-to-be, was f&ted at the Then.
Sparkes’ home at Wahroona, Ascot, amidst bowls of
red roses. The hostess was in mauve organdie, and
Millie Baker in cream, with a pansy-colored hat.
“Tales of Old Japan” was given by the Brisbane
Musical Union in the Exhibition Concert Hall. Lena
Hammond, in henna mariette, and Ruth Portraite,
in ombre broidered georgette, were soloists. Lieut.-
Gov. Lennon and the Mayoral Jollys were amongst
the audience.
Gaelic songs and Highland flings were a feature
of the Highland Society’s meeting in St. Luke’s
Hall, and Allan McKillop, a meenister, spoke on
the old Highland sports. After that there were
oat cakes and a wee drappie.
Edith Barry had the Centennial Hall for her
dance, at which Una Gyles began the programme
with a Russian Peasant solo. There were Hawaiian
dances and Chinese gavottes and butterfly whirls.
A presentation of a silver sandwich-tray was made
to Mrs. Barry, and of a handbag to her daughter.
The Dickens Fellowship held their Christmas
party in the Women’s Club Rooms. Holly and red
blossomry made the decorations, with festoons of
red and green. Plum puddings and other important
items of a Dickens Christmas were spread. A little
snow and ice outside would not have come amiss.
Gov. Lennon, with Captain Plant attending, was
there, and Dr. and Mrs. Cumbrae Stewart, dressed
as Dickens and his spouse, welcomed the crowd.
The Eric Annings had a dance for the young
Britishers. The hostess wore slate-blue and Betty
Anning was in floral ninon. Sunflowers and gaillar-
dias decorated, and the verandahs were screened for
dancing.
The City Council has at last been handed a long
desired gift by the Government in the shape of
St. Helena Island, in Moreton Bay. For many years
a penal settlement, it has been coveted as an ideal
seaside resort, for it has fine beaches and is sur-
rounded with rich fishing grounds. All that it needs
is a bit of tree-planting, for prison requirements
kept it very bare. A big proportion of Brisbane
spends its summer week-ends “down the Bay” and
to them especially the long-banned island will be a
welcome haven.

Inter-State tennis at the Albert Ground
on Friday and Saturday drew a record crowd
On the first day there was such a cool
breeze that most of the girls discarded hats
in favor of bandeaux of colored ninon or
tulle. Spectators were relieved of the neces-
sity of balancing sunshades, but, all the same,
some dinky little fan-like parasols were on
parade. M;s. T. Hawkes, of Geelong,
dazzled the front rows with a green one held
against an ail-black turn-out. Mrs. Norman
Brookes wore si becoming kasha suit of
lavender hue topped by a large hat, and
Gerald Patterson’s wife was in a white
ensemble suit with a cyclamen pink hat.
Mrs. P. O’Hara Wood was a study in grey.
Lady Stonehaven was there in a delphinium
blue jumper suit and a Pandan hat, Captain
Broadhurst accompanying her. Vera de
Bavay was in cream silk with a dash of
crimson, a long velvet streamer dangling
from her red hat. Joan McArthur’s pink
frisca frock was companioned by a hat of
the’same shade. The Harry Whitings, Mrs.
Fred Thiel, the Wertheims, the Robbs, and
crowds of enthusiasts endured the heat of
the day.
Many of the inter-State tennis players got
along to the dance of the South Yarra Club
on Saturday night and enjoyed themselves
hugely. Many of the frocks glimmered, and
skirts in most instances bisected the knees
of the wearers, who were mainly of the
younger set. Mrs. L. A. Baker, wife of the
club’s president, was in jade-green with ecru
lace; Mrs. R. Harper blended filmy lace
with blue taffetas; Mrs. Murray (5.A..) had
scintillations upon her pervendhe blue frock;
Miss K. Le Messurier (also S.A.) danced
in a bois-de-rose gown; Miss Bolan chose
pink, and crystal embroidery; Esma Boyd
sported opalescent ornamentation upon a
green frock; Phyllis Best’s fair hair shone
above black lace, and Miss Meaney, a Ma
State representative, was sheathed in del-
pliinium-blue.
There was a great traffic of evening shoes
over the gangway of the Marella one night
last week, when a dance was held in the
interests of the Legacy Club, an organisa-
tion of ex-officers which gives the sons of
needy war-widows a helping hand. Burns,
Philp, and Co. lent the ship, and the High-
land Pipe Band, which P. E.
Potts, Federal president of the Legacy Club,
as its president also, skirled and droned
some national dances, and even had a shot at
playing jazz while the regular orchestra was
at supper. Loud speakers were fixed at
intervals amid the flags and palms round the
decks, and the music was thus broadcasted
from stem to stern. J. 11. Downing and
11. E. Williams were organisers. Dr. Mark
Gardner, president of the club’s local branch,
was there with his wife, who wore a short
white fur coat over her pink frock,which had
embellishment of lace and quillings of ribbon.
Mrs. P. E. Potts wore black satin and lace.

ninon, tasselled with steel.Jbeads at ,inter-
vals ; Mrs. Horace Mackennal, in a frock of
deep petunia hue edged with grey fur; Ger-
trude Johns, lately back from a year in
India, in coral-pink taffeta, and Mrs. G. Thir-
kell, wearing a cloth-of-silver gown, were pat-
rons who caught the roving eye.
The Women’s Auto. Club asked ex-Mayor-
ess Brunton to drop in for tea at the rooms
one afternoon last week, for the sake of the
past days, as it were. Water-lilies, pink
and white, were handed to the guest of
honor, who wore an ensemble gown, a
mingling of three tones of fawn in geor-
gette, lace and ribbon, with a black picture
hat. Mrs. R. J. Byers accompanied her, in
a black frock, with a nattier-blue hat. Mrs.
H. J. Robertson, club president, hostessed
in a caped frock of purple tone topped by
a hat of paler hue that bore harmonising
roses. Music, chatter and tea were enjoyed
in a floral setting in which gorgeous gladioli
played a brave part.
Old Girls of St. Catherine’s mobilised at
the school last week to celebrate the feast of
their patron saint, beginning the day with
the reading of matins. At afternoon-tea time
representatives were elected to the O.G.s’
Association committee, and a jazz band made
a cheerful background for chatter as cheerful.
The principals—Miss Langley, in black
blended with floral-patterned georgette and
black hat, and Miss Templeton, Avhose per-
simmon-hued frock was topped by fawn
millinery—gave their ex-students warm
greeting.
The bridge party and dance held at the
Wattle last week in aid of the After-care
Home was also a flower show. The blooms
sent in for sale made a wonderful display in
the vestibule. Mrs. Ham, besides lending
her premises for the cause, gave the refresh-
ments as well. The Best lady was president
of the organising committee, of which the
Mayoress, Mrs. Morell, was vice-president,
Mrs. J. Hewison hon. organiser, and Mrs.
Fred Tatham hon. sec. and treasurer.
Richard Pitcher’s affable wife plotted the
successful bridge party that is to help
Merric Boyd set up his pottery kiln and
workshops again after their destruction by
fire. The show of the Three A’s at the
Athenseum Gallery made just the right set-
ting. Margaret Baskerville sent the original
small model of her memorial bust of Editli
Cavell to be sold, and the takings were £l2
the richer.
Our new Mayor and his wife celebrated their
silver wedding on Saturday with a dinner
at the Windsor, where the Morells received
congratulations amid pink roses and pink and
white water-lilies in silver baskets.
On a recent afternoon Dr. and Mrs. Back-
house, of Stratford, Gippsland, handed over
their second daughter, Yvonne Isabel, into the
keeping of the Rev. Lewis Harold Williams,
of Edenhope. Holy Trinity, Balaclava, was
the scene of it, and Bishop Green and Canon
Williams made a job of it. The bridal gown
of white satin beauts was liberally garnished
with Honiton lace taken from the family
chest, and a veil of the same floated over
a long train of cloth of silver, built from
the shoulders. An armful of water-lilies
completed the picture. Sister Vera and
cousin Nellie attended, frocked in apricot
marocain, their golden hats furnished with
autumn foliage to match their posies. Gwen
Ashley and Honey Williams, in lace-trimmed
frocks of corn-colored crepe de Chine
crowned with floral circlets and floating tulle
veils, bore the glistening train. Congratu-
lations were said at No. 9 Darling-street.
Our latest hostel for girls is the Princess
Mary Club, erected in the grounds of
Wesley Church, in Lonsdale-street, a big
pile with a trace of Gothic in its architec-
ture. Private donations, including £15,000
from the Aspro Nicholases, have provided
this £60,000 dwelling, which will house 100
girls. There is a huge, beautifully-furnished
lounge, with a concert-grand, a player-piano,
and an array of pictures given by artists.
The dining-room has Jacobean furniture,
the bathrooms are dreams of luxury, and the
kitchen is a super-kitchen, equipped with
every known labor-saving device. Single bed-
rooms comfortably furnished, all having win-
dows letting in God’s sunlight, occupy two
floors, and upon the flat roof are a laundry
and a sewing-room.
This is “Silk and Lace,” otherwise W. B.
Mclnnes’s portrait of Esther Paterson (Mrs.
G. Gill). As
every Bul-
letin reader
knows, she is
a black-and-
white artist
who can un-
leash a snappy
line. Betty,
who does the
p r e c o ck>us
kids, is a sis-
ter. She is
Mrs. Newman
when she isn't
Betty. The
lady in the
picture made
such a good
job of being
a sitter not so
much because
she sympa-
thises with
artists as be-
cause there is a family tradition to keep
up An ancestor was painted by Raeburn,
and doubtless helped to establish that
good Scotsman’s reputation. Mclnnes
reckons that “Silk and Lace” is his best
canvas, and more man one critic says it
is the best portrait yet painted in Austra-
lia. The National Gallery trustees made
a bid for it, but their offer wasn’t high
enough.
Mrs. Gilfillan, known to the art world of
Melbourne as May Yale, hung some of her
oils and water-colors at the Lyceum Club
for two days last week, and also displayed
samples of her enamel work and jewellery,
in which blister pearls and moonstones are
used with good results. A beaten metal
sugar-basin and tea-caddy with opal-like
adornment were exhibits upon which longing
eyes were cast. The lady’s flower studies
were her best contribution, notable being a
firescreen featuring the strelitzia plant, with
its quaint, bird-like blooms. The Lyceum’s
president, Mrs. T. a’Beckett, a very old
friend of the artist, sent the show pleasantly
on its way with some words of commenda-
tion.
The near approach of their departure for
Norfolk Island has awakened the Victor Sell-
lieims to a sense of their popularity, and
their days are being filled with festivities.
Cheery little Mrs. Victor, who has been
actively associated with the friendly Union
of Sailors’ and Soldiers’ Wives and Mothers,
will be greatly missed at its social gather-
ings.
Friends of Rear-Admiral Mark Bundle,
who was in Australia with the Special Ser-
vice Squadron—he belongs to the engineer-
ing branch —are extending a welcome to his
daughter, Mrs. R. A. Balfour, who has
arrived with her husband, he on business
bent. As a director of Arthur Balfour, Ltd.,
of Sheffield, he has come to inquire into this
country’s steel requirements.
One of the first three women students to
graduate in Architecture at Sydney Uni.
w a s Lorna
Lukin, eldest
daughter o f
the Banana-
land Judge,
who has lately
come south to
the Arbitra-
tion Court.
After gradua-
t i o n she
married bar-
rister P. D.
Phillips, o f
Melbourne.
One of he r
recent com-
missions was
the designing
of the new
Lyceum Club
rooms in the
E., S. and A.
Bank building.
Mrs. Phillips,
who hopes to hang out her sign shortly,
intends to concentrate largely upon domestic
architecture and the planning of gardens--
the latter a much-neglected art. A Bernice
Agar camera made the picture.
Eleanor, eldest daughter of the J. C.
Andrewarthas, of Hobart, has chosen for a i
fiance Walter, elder son of Mrs. J. R. Senior,
of Kingsbury, London.
Friends of the after-care hospital were
welcome to an entertainment at the Queen’s
Hall at which the Little Arts Company,
under Beresford Fowler, provided the lion’s
share of ‘the programme. There were
dramatic spasms, in which Mona Pepyat,
Lucy Ahon and Daisy Bradley figured, and
some singing. Kathleen Rogers Thomson,
La Tour Lomax, Dulcie Cherry, lately of
“The Sentimental Bloke,” and Mrs. Malcolm
Roberts, who contrasted a leaf-green gown
with her auburn locks, were songbirds.
Sonatas by Eugene Goossens and Erno
Dohnanyi burst for the first time on the air
the other evening when Gertrude Healy drew
them from her fiddle, aided and abetted by
Mrs. H. E. Spry, who watched the interests
of the composers from the business end of a
piano that must have weighed nearly a ton.
Before they had done, the pair played the
“Kreutzer Sonata” —the one that Tolstoy,
after his bad habits had given him up, found
so dreadfully naughty. The Lyceum Club's
reception-room brimmed over with music-
lovers. Mrs. Spry wore something softly
pink with a bordering of fur, and the violinist
was a pale glimmer of white satin, silver
lace and crystal.
Pianist Mancel Kirby, who off the con-
cert platform, is the wife of Dr. Reg Ellery,
of Sunbury Asylum and The Bulletin’s
Red Page, played before the members of
the Music Club on a recent evening. Origi-
nally a student of the Albert-street Con., she
afterwards went to Lawrence Godfrey Smith
in Sydney. The recitalist’s covering for her
latest concert was of deep cosmos pink, with
a sprinkling of glitter. She played “On a
May Evening,” by Arnold Bax, not previ-
ously heard here. Scriabine, Beethoven,
Bach, SainUSaens and Schumann were
drawn upon, and a Fritz Hart composition
figured on the programme. Mrs. G. Tliirkell,
in a wrap of emerald-green and silver, the
Fritz Harts and son Basil, Mary Campbell,
and Dr. Ellery were listeners.
Roy Shepherd, who went to the Big Smoke
on a Clarke scholarship to study the piano-
forte, is progressing well. He is one of
five students who are being taught by the
august' Harold Samuels. The Australian
earned the favorable comment of critics at
a recital with Roy Ellett, who was Dame
Clara Butt’s accompanist on her recent tour
of these part*.
Mrs. Jimmy Dyer, wearing soft apparel
of faint blue splashed with pink and gold
chrysanthemums, presided at the Music
Society’s meeting at the Assembly Hall last
week. Milton’s verse was spoken by Carrie
Haase, and music for strings by those fine
old English composers Orlando Gibbons and
William Byrd was performed by the society’s
quartette, led by Alberto Zelman. Miss
Haase wore a flowing period gown of white,
which looked very romantic in the soft glow
of lanterns swung from standards. Her selec-
tions were mainly drawn from “Paradise
Lost.”
Eileen O’Keefe's students gave her a com-
plimentary concert at the Queen s Hall last
week. Dorothy Dwyer and Primrose Spence,
who will look after Miss O’Keefes classes
during her absence abroad, engineered the
entertainment. Poems spoken by the choir
included a group of old Chinese translations,
one of which was from the Cbnfucian ana-
lects.
The Professional Women’s Club has eaten its
last dinner of the year. On this occasion Row-
ena Chisholm. Director of the Emily McPher-
son College of Domestic Economy, which has
just moved into new and resplendent quar-
ters, talked about her work. She has just
returned from Europe and America, where
she had a look at schools that teach house-
hold craft. She found that in France, Nor-
way and Sweden cooking and sewing are
regarded as sciences these days, and taught
accordingly. Glasgow and Belfast have
splendid domestic-science colleges, and in
America things are even more advanced.
Canada has a simply perfect training-school
attached to Toronto University. The msti-
tution over which Miss Chisholm rules
guides over 300 students, and she has large
hopes, too, when it settles down in its new
quarters in Latrobe-street.
The Douglas Richardsons will celebrate
the twelfth anniversary of their wedding on
December 23 with an old English Christmas
party, tree and all, at the Anzac Hostel for
invalid soldiers at Gardenvale. The gener-
ous little lady discovered that the festive
season was not likely to be over-festive there;
hence the choice of venue.
The Murphy-Jardine knot was tied very
quietly on account of a recent family
bereavement. Only relatives were present.
Ti_e H. M. Murphys are amongst Vic.’s
oldest colonists—the bride’s grandparents
went to live in Tara, still the family home,
before the South Yarra suburb was thought
of. The bridegroom, Kenneth Jardine, is a
transplanted Scot. 1 The dainty bride looked
ethereal in a cloud of petal-pink georgette,
a mist of white tulle floating round the
shoulders and confined with a tissue band
set with orange blossoms. Sister Maisie
attended in apricot georgette, and her veil
was bound with a gold tissue band.
The Ministering Children’s League’s
annual picnic to its Cottage by the Sea
will be held on Saturday, December 4. The
Hygeia has been chartered, and will leave
Port Melbourne at nine o’clock. In the
afternoon there will be a little ceremony
in connection with the endowment of a cot
in memory of the late Mrs. Robert Harper,
president of the league from its inception in
1889 until her death in 1924.
St. Kilda’s Town Clerk, Frederick Cham-
berlin, and,his wife left in the Narkunda
for a holiday in the Big Smoke. The couple
are popular, and they had to return thanks
for many a parting gift.
Sister Adelaide’s survey :
The Darnley Naylors have embarked upon a sea
of good-bye parties. The Teachers’ Union, to which
he lias been an invaluable adviser, had a special
session to say its farewell, and from the Leag’ue of
IN ft ions’ Union there was a dinner, with presents for
both of them.
The engagement is announced of Yvonne, only
daughter of the Douglas Tolleys, to Oswald Bowen,
of Melbourne, which city she is at the moment visit-
ing. She is a clever amateur dancer.
The Children’s Hospital started its annual fete
with a cheque for over £27o—proceeds of the sale
of three bullocks given by Sidney Kidman to his
daughter, Mrs. Sidney Ayers, who is one of the
stallholders.
Lady Bridges drank tea with members of the
Adelaide Lawn Tennis Club on prize-giving day
and handed over trophies. Miss Turnbull annexed
the croquet singles, both championship and handicap,
and in tennis the championship went to Bertha
Kay and the handicap prize to Jean Taylor.
From England comes news of Clara Serena and
her husband. She is booked for recitals in Vienna,
Paris and Berlin; then the “Celebrity” concerts at
the big English watering-places; afterwards, per-
haps, a tour in Italy. The Serenas are still
enthusiastic about the kindness Ada Crossley has
shown them. But it is the same with all Aus-
tralians who come under her hospitable wing.
The Kenneth Duffields made local presswomen and
the Healo company joint guests at lunch at the
South Australian. The show, which made some-
thing of a hit when produced by a mostly-amateur
cast, is to be given its ohance with a professional
one—one of the amateurs, George Langley, staying
on in his original part, and making his debut as
a professional.
Clive Carey’s enterprise in establishing an opera
class at the Conservatorium has been well justified,
and its members gave an excellent account of them-
selves in “Shamus O’Brien” at the Norwood Town
Hall. The honors of the evening fell to Yalda Harvy
as Nora and Marjorie Walsh as Kitty. The audi-
ence, which included Lady Bridges, was generous in
both size and appreciation. The Orpheus Society
has given a concert, too, with the St. Peter’s
Cathedral choir boys to help them.
The Santrey Band went to the Palais after its
theatre performance on Friday, and that usually
early-closing dance hall announced itself as willing
to keep going till 3 a.m. The Healo and New Idea
companies were there in force, with most of the
younger dancing set, and much that wasn’t so young.

Modern Engineering
Has Created this New-Type Car
It sets a new pace in power ,
economy and speed that all
must eventually follow . • •
35
miles
per
imperial
gallon
r PHE Whippet is a remarkable motor
1 car different from anything you
have ever known before. It combines
the latest engineering practices of Europe
with the improved standards of American
performance.
This car has a low-appearing modern-
type body with height and length in true symmetrical
proportion. More inside room than other light cars.
Beautifully finished in Duotone Duco.
It has a high-torque, 31-horsepower motor of small
bore and long stroke —the same principle that is used
in the fastest racing cars of America and Europe. Its
power enables you to take hills and pull through sand
and mud that seemed impossible before.
Utmost safety
Four-wheel brakes are an integral part of this car’s
chassis design. Measured tests show that the Whippet
will stop in 31 feet from a speed of 40 miles an hour.
Its centre of gravity is extremely low, with ample
road clearance . . . thus giving a sense of security you
have never found in any light car before.
Hitherto unheard-of economy
You have wanted a more economical light car . . .
here is one. The Whippet will run 35 miles on an
Imperial gallon of petrol . . . well over 1000 miles on
a gallon of oil . . . and will give you unusual mileage
on tyres.
It cuts present operating costs about in half. Doubles
the value of money spent on upkeep.
\ Try this car
Prove to yourself that this car is incomparable to
any other light car. In fairness to yourself test the
Whippet before you buy. You have never seen any
car like it before.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The monotony of a long programme at
Canterbury Park (N.S.W.) on Saturday was relieved
by the spectacle of an excited apprentice jockey riding
Hinehinbrook out in the fourth furlong of the Canter-
bury Handicap, 11 furlongs, and easing her up under
the impression that he had won by lengths, presently
to go in frantic pursuit of the field. The thing was
so funny that even backers of the mare joined in the
roars of laughter that went up from grandstand and
leger reserve; but the stewards took a serious view
of it, and the poor little beggar who lost his head
is threatened with the loss of his license. Lady
Lizzie (8 to 1), a Fortafix mare who has done a
lot of racing this season, won narrowly;, Dartmoor
(4 to 1) and Real Mackay (7 to i) were the
nearest of her pursuers. Boonala (9 to 4), who has
likewise been up a long time, was produced again
in the Highweight Handicap, but, being unable
to get going as briskly as usual, he failed by half
a length to overtake English Gag (5 to 2), a fife-
year-old chestnut gelding by imported Rangag, sire
of Irish Prince. English Gag is a rather good cut
of a sprinter, as also is the Sir Dighton mare Grfivene
(5 to 2), who downed the still speedy though
ageing Woodville (3 to 1) in the Flying Handicap.
* * * *
Newcastle people have formed a high
opinion of Stormy, a five-year-old chestnut gelding
by Quinn Abbey—Gipsy Martian. Imported from
Maoriland a few months ago, and shrewdly placed,
Stormy has not been defeated in four rapes, and his
party has cleaned-up substantially each time. In a
mile event at the Newcastle club’s Great/Northern Cup
meeting, the steed from beyond the Tasman dropped
back from first to last at one stage, but, came again
in the straight to win, running away, from Donald,
who has Randwick form to recomipend him, and
Ghurka. Three days later, Torbellino, one of the
unplaced division in Stormy’s handicap, beat Black-
man and other platers of repute ovef the same dis-
tance, while Donald was second to '.the in-and-out
Gleam Boy (6 to 1) in the Great Northern Cup.
Donald, Gleam Boy, Torbellino /and Blackman hare
been nominated for the big Christmas handicaps at
Randwick, but Stormy’s name is missing. He is
to go back to Maoriland forthwith.
Punters had visions of a profitable day
at Sandown Park (Vic.) when the first two races
were taken by favorites, but the good work was
not continued” first picks being defeated for the
rest of the afternoon. Old,Llanthony (9 to 2) made
every post a winner in the Park Handicap, 10 fur-
longs, and although he ran out at the entrance
to the straight it did not* prevent him from beating
Taiyin (10 to 1) and Reputed King (3 to 1) very
comfortably; the time was 2min. 6sec. V.R.C. Chair-
man Wackinnon’s well-bred filly Lady Tattler (Spear-
head —Queen Gossip) took the Trial Welter in
rather good style, after going out at 5 to 1; and
Spearfelt’s stable-mate Fury (5 to 1), putting in a
wonderful run up the long straight, just pipped
Chelidon (7 to 1) in the Sandown Plate. All Sun-
shine’s gelded brother Rugbyean (9 to 2) made some
atonement for many disappointments by accounting
for a lot of moderates in the Sandown Purse. Eric
Connolly got rid of All Sunshine long ago, but he
has hung on to Rugbyean, who may yet fulfil the
promise he showed as a two-year-old.

•Louden”: “Greatest amount o’ puddin
I ever seen ’umped in a race,” said Dan, the old-
time jockey, “was 17 stone. That’s what Atlas ’ad
when I won the Muttagunyah Cup on ’im 60 year
ago. I was on’y a boy at the time an’ could ’a’
gone to scale at 5 stone, so that meant puttin’ up a
lot o’ dead weight. Any’ow I got the biggest saddle
that was about an.’ all the spare lead that was on
the course, an’ then I couldn’t draw it. Jist as
they was goin’ to scratch ’im, I sees a lot of empty
kerosene-tins lyin’ around, so I suggests carryin’ a
few. That did the trick, but I ’ad to carry 16
of tjiem to make up the weight. Course Atlas was
a champeen. W’en they brought ’im to town ’e won
a Melbin Cup an’ a Gran’ Nashnul Steeple in the
one day. Two years afterwards the ’andicapper gave
’im 12 stone in the Derby, but ’e broke down doin’
’is final gallop an’ never raced again.”

“Ike O’Bag” : The screams of the book-
makers about the iniquitous taxation that hampers
their beneficent activities in Australia help to
obscure the fact that the punter pays it, indirectly.
According to a S’African odds-merchant who is
visiting Melbourne, the Natal Government goes after
the punter in the open, as well as after O’Roolt. The
latter is expected to weigh in with 5 per cent, on
his day’s winnings, but the punter has to slip
5 per cent, of every successful bet. The pilgrim
denounced the system as highly injurious to punters.
He instanced the figurative tragedy of a mug who.
being a hundred out on the day, went to win it
back on the last race, only to find that he was
£5 out, the cruel Government leaving him only
£95. The remedy obviously is to win enough to
pay the tax, in addition to getting your money
back. But rarely do these last-race recoveries
happen. In fiction of the sporting-novel and racing-
journal type they are common enough. In real life
the man who “goes for the gloves” generally re-
turns without even his socks.

Fiscom, perhaps the greatest Australian
hurdler next to Redleap, was not spared to end his
days in a paddock. He won the G. N. Hurdle with
9st. Sib. in 1921, with list. 61b. in 1922, and was
second that year in the Australian Hurdle with 12st.
71b. —and for reward he was kept at his dangerous
game when long past his prime. At Cheltenham
(S.A.) last Saturday the ill-requited animal fell,
lay writhing in agony, and was clespatched by a
vet.’s bullet. It is time something was done to
prevent faithful old back-numbers being callously
exposed to the risk of breaking their necks or
bursting their hearts. If the turf clubs won’t take
preventive measures the cruelty-to-animals laws
should be so amended that the S.P.C.A. may inter-
vene. ,
• # * *
The folly of matching two blacks was once
more demonstrated at the .Sydney Stadium on
Saturday night, when “Tiger” Payne (list. 81b.)
and “Sunny” Jim Williams (list. 131 b.) were parties
to a fiasco witnessed 1 f) about 11,000 whites. Wil-
liams was a red-hot favorite. “Tiger” went for him
from the moment they met at centre, mostly swinging
rights but occasionally jabbing a left at the head
or hooking it to the body. Williams, with the
aspect of a man who sees a cliff falling on him and
can only take to shark-water to evade it, shuffled
round the ring for all he was worth, but ever and
anon the “Tiger” would get home with one or other
of its raking paws ; and so it went on for two rounds.
The third was three minutes of horror to Williams,
who tottered to his chair and began vehement pro-
tests to trainer-second Jack Dunleavy, who beckoned
to the referee. That official summoned the Stadium
doctor, who sat at the ringside, and a medical exami-
nation was beginning when the bell rang. There
was a swift scatter of seconds, referee and doctor as
Williams plunged desperately to meet the prancing
“Tiger.” Payne’s whirling gloves landed half a

BRASSIE : “Yes, you’ll find me on the links
half my time. My partner sticks to the

who does that is really no good to the
business.”

MRS. DOOLEY : “Did y’r ’usband ’ave any luck at th'

dozen times, and presently Williams was kneeling
on the canvas. He got up, but promptly resumed his
prayerful attitude, this time without being struck,
and Wallis hopped between, shouting “No fight.”
Payne collected £ 450-odd for his ten-minutes’
act. Williams’s £ 450-odd has been withheld pend-
ing substantiation of his claim that he was damaged
so grievously as to be unable to continue. He
alleged that a rib had been fractured, but Dr.
Bohrsmann could find no evidence thereof. Then
it was suggested that the cartilage had been
bruised, or something of the sort. Old-timers
can remember seeing Jack McGowan fighting coolly
with one arm, the other being badly broken. Jim
Burge, too, with an eyebrow hanging by a strip
of skin, asked his seconds to pin it on and let him
get at the cow. But those were days when Aus-
tralians would have laughed at the notion of pay-
ing twenty, five, three and two, plus tax, to
see a scrap between two second-rate coons.

“Ringsider”: The passing of Peter Felix
recalls his fight with another colored gent., Starlight.
They quarrelled over a lady, and had it out at the
now-demolished Queen’s Hall, Bourke-street, Mel-
bourne; Starlight weighed list. 61b., and Felix ISst.
121 b. After a gruelling bout the bigger black won.
Starlight, now over 70, has been a ship’s cook for
many years and still follows that useful calling when
Walsh and Johansen permit. He was cook on the
Cooma when the boat fell foul of a reef off the
Queensland co.ist. Felix left a son who seeks the
bubble reputation in Melbourne dance-halls as an
exponent of the Charleston. Twenty-five years of
age and just on 6ft., he has never had a fight in his
life and never will have one, he says, if he can
help it.

“Timo”: The boxing game in Brisbane is
just about strangled. Night cycling has captured
the crowd which used to go to the Stadium after
its Saturday dinner. A managerial habit of put-
ting up the tariff on the slightest provocation lias
contributed to the slump, as also has the policy of
giving preference to colored and other imported
pugs, to the detriment, of course, of possible Darcys
and Dawsons. The Brisbane pugilistic situation is
a striking illustration of how surely a sport goes
down when Grab becomes king.

“Arcades Ambo”: The sins of his youth
rose up to smite Bernard Shaw when Gene Tunney,
as eminent in pugilism and publicity as is Shaw in
literature and limelighting, said some hard words of
the author of “Cashel Byron’s Profession.” Tunney
had been asked to appear in a film version of Shaw’s
first and most unfortunate novel. He indignantly
refused, saying that the story was “silly and im-
mature” and that he objected to portraying the
character of a “blundering vulgarian.” Bernard
contented himself with advising Tunney to re-write
the story to his own liking. It was reserved for
London Star to deliciously explain Cashel’s vul-
garianism: “He spent his youth as a hanger-on in
an Australian boxing saloon.”

Mike Yokel (12st. 91b.) and Billy Meeske
(12st. 131 b.) were again in holts at the Melbourne
Stadium on Saturday night, this time according to
catch-as-catch-ean rules. “All in” or otherwise
Mike seems to have Billy’s measure. He gained n
fall in the third round with an old-fashioned cradle-
hold, and in the seventh he forced Williams’s shoul-
ders down while the latter hung tenaciously to a
punishing but otherwise worthless wrist-lock.
Meeslce’s solitary fall came in round five per
medium of a reverse head-lock. It is a case of
mothballs for wrestlers in Melbourne now, but they
will return with the cold weather. They don’t get
such purses anywhere else.

“Amateur Pro.”: Lawn-tennis control in
this country needs tightening up. The inter-State
tourney between N.S.W. and Victoria was on the
point of being abandoned owing to a dispute between
the rival captains, Gerald Patterson and J. O.
Anderson. Patterson objected, as was his right, to
Anderson altering /the “grading” of the N.S.W.
players on the ground that it might influence the
results. Rules provide in such cases that the umpire’s
decision shall be final. In thisi instance it went against
Anderson, who declined to accept it, giving as an
excuse that he had telephoned the N.S.AV. officials,
who had told him toi grade the team as he liked.
Sooner than see the tourney abandoned, Patterson
yielded. Subsequently, the N.S.W. officials stated
that, while they had given Anderson full grading
powers, they had told him to accept the umpire’s
decision.
Patterson avenged himself on Anderson by beating
that gentleman 6—4, 6—2. Also Jim Willard,
who, Patterson argued, should have been ranked
above Olemenger, won both his matches, defeating
Schlesinger, 6—3, 6—2,' and O’Hara Wood, 7—5,
■6—4 ; whereas Clemenger lost to Patterson, B—TO,
3 —6, and to Hawkes, 2 —6, I—6. J. O. Cummings
and young Crawford did well for
N. S. Wales, Cummings overcoming O’Hara Wood,
9 —7, 6 —-2 and Schlesinger, 3—6, 7—5, 12 —10,
and the colt accounting for Mclnnes, I—6,1 —6, 7 —5,
6—2, and Fitchett, 6 —4, 6—3. However, the Vic-
torians proved so vastly superior in doubles that
they gained eight of the nine matches played. Clem-
enger and Cummings scored the Ma State’s solitary
victory by outing Schlesinger and Fitchett, 6 —l,
B—6.8 —6. The final results saw Vic. victorious in the
men’s event by 12 rubbers to 9, and in the women’s
section by 9 to 3. Against S. Aus. Victoria scored
16 rubbers to 6 and 8 rubbers to 4 in the respec-
tive sections.
“White City’’: It was hoped by the N.S.W. lawn-
tennis authorities that the promised visit of a
Japanese team would help to raise the cash needed
to save the courts at Rushcutters Bay. That is all
off, as Harada, the star performer, has to do his
term of military service under the conscription laws,
and cannot leave Nippon. Thank heavens there is
no beastly entanglement of that sort to prevent
Australia’s cracks going abroad!

The Iredale Shield, which was hung up
for competition among the country cricket sides that
come to Sydney for their “week,”
went to the Northern team on
points. There were numerous
creditable batting performances,
but the prayed-for bowling genius
did not turn up, though there
were several consistently success-
ful trundlers, notably the spec-
tacled B. C. J. Bettington, some-
time of King’s School and Oxford.
A leg-break bowler, with spin and
pace off the pitch, Bettington has
a googly which whips in from the
off, and is well concealed. In
his five games he took 33 wickets
for an average of 11.12. McGuirk,
a 22-year-old medium-paced right-
hander from Southern Districts,
seems the find among the new
hands. Fast off the pitch, with a
good off-break, he collected 23
wickets, averaging 12.62.

The two Maoriland football
teams in England continue to show
in-and-out form. Beaten 3; —0 by
Cornwall, the Union Maoris wal-
loped Leicester by 16 to 13. The
League side, after vanquishing
Keighley, 21 —3, succumbed to an-
other Lancashire side in Swin-
ton, which scored 16 to 14. So
far the Union players have been
drawing huge gates, by which,
individually, they will not benefit.
The League men, who really need
the money, are having a frosty time,

Queensland celebrated tlie jubilee of the
State’s Cricket Association by making a meritorious
start in its first Sheffield Shield game against N.S.W.
at Brisbane. Though the Australian XI cracks were
absent, the N.S.W. side was strong in batting, and
to dismiss it for 280 on a plumb wicket was a
good bit of work on the Queenslanders’ part. Indeed,
bad it not been for a magnificent 127 by Kippax,
helped by Scanes (38), the score would have looked
like the change for threepence. Mayes, a tall
Toow'oomba lad, who bowled some seasons for Sydney
Uni. and on a couple of occasions for N.S.W., trundled
well, taking 4 for 53 with his fast-medium swingers,
and was well supported by R. Oxenham with slow
leg breaks (4 for 54). Gough, a newcomer who
also bowls leg-breaks, took the other two wickets,
including that of the Balmain youngster, Jackson,
who went for 5. Queensland compiled 356 in
response, F. C. Thompson gathering 134, and the
trustworthy R. Oxenham 57. Thompson’s runs were
made in 171 minutes, and his showing was in no
way eclipsed by that of Kippax. The later bats-
men fotmd Campbell, the young Gordon googly
bowler, too tricky; he finished with 6 for 120.
Morgan went cheaply in N.S.W.’s second innings (he
and Seddon failed in both innings), but Steele (130),
Kippax (131), Jackson (86) and Scanes (47) put their
side in a winning position. The fielding was patchy,
Kippax and Steele, whose partnership realised 236,
both giving chances which were not accepted ; never-
theless, the batting in each case was excellent, and
the Marrickville left-hander has certainly justified
the selectors. Jackson had the hard luck to be run
out when going strongly for a century in his first
inter-State match. R. Oxenham got 3 for 83 and
Benstead 3 for 61.

“Brind”: Touching Australian-made
cricket bats (B. 13/11/’26), the Bathurst High School
and the Technical College, Ultimo, use them exclu-
sively. The bats are knocked together by a master,
name of Teasdale, and the users have no complaints.

“Shrewsbury” : The proposal of the Eng-
lish cricket authorities to consider the question of
assisting bowlers by using a smaller ball is yet
another instance of the one-eyed fashion in which
the expert approaches such matters. _ Some time ago
an attempt was made to alter the size and composi-
tion of golf balls because some players were driving
them too far. That scheme broke down, because the
average player, who makes up the greater propor-
tion of a golf club’s personnel, discovered he was no
better for the long-carrying ball from which the
crack got such length. He found his holes quite
long enough for him without the handicap of a less
lively ball. In the same way, the ordinary ci'icketer
finds the ball quite hard enough to hit.
“Shrewsbury”: The ill-feeling between the
Maoriland and Australian Soccer authorities is not
lessening since M.L. missed the ’bus —and the gates—■
in respect to the visit of the Englishmen. Australian
tours of Maoriland and vice-versa have been side-
stepped, and this country’s desire to bring over an-
other Canadian team has met with the retort dis-
courteous. M.L. announces that she is importing
a combination of Canucks on her own, and no
Australians need apply. The team arrives in May
and will remain for three months. Australia is
expected to counter with an Indian native team, but
that is not settled yet.
The Christmas Bulletin will be pub-
lished on Saturday, December 11. It will
contain, besides many fine illustrations, as
much reading matter —short stories and verse
—as the ordinary seven-and-sixpenny novel.
The Bulletin hates to help itself to com-
pliments, but it honestly doesn’t know
another literary sixpenn’orth anything like
this Christmas number.
AT THE PONIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“There are racegoers who like to indulge the
pretence that they go racing for the love of sport,
or to encourage the breeding of horses, or for some
other lofty purpose unconnected with gambling. At
the ponies that kind of pretence is ruthlessly thrown
aside.”— Sydney Daily Teleguaph.
Aye, they can have, my son,
Randwick and Fleniington,
Where prads like "Manfred run,
The toffs and tonics,
The affluent and pnoud
In raiment glad and loud.
You’ll find a diff’rent crowd
Here at the ponies.
Racing they go, some say,
To pass the time away—
For recreation gay—
To meet their cronies—
For God’s fresh air—for sport—
Or, if they’re young, to court.
We ain't that blooming sort,
Not at the ponies.
No Romeo here awaits
His Juliet by the gates;
No Venus fixes dates
With her Adonis.
Such goings-on gs these
We’d deem frivolities,
Distractions to displease
Blokes at the ponies.
Wo’re frankly out to bet,
And all we can to get
Thereby. Our brows are set,
Stout chaps and bonies,
Over one problem vexed
That leaves us sore perplexed:
Viz., what’ll win the next
Race at the ponies.
The Sport o’ Kings! Get hence!
Unload that guff on gents.
Who revel in pretence
Like goats or coneys
In plots where cresses grow.
We’re out, if you must know,
Simply to wrest the dough
Away from Ikey Mo,
Here at the ponies.

THE INKY WAY.
If Frank Crowr, of the mechanical side of
the Rockhampton (Q.) Morning Bulletin,
had stuck to his Job a few weeks longer he
would have been £V2 years in the office. But
he reckons that a , spell is a fair thing, and
retired last month.
Popular Hobbies, a monthly conceived by
the proprietors of Stead’s, was born in Mel-
bourne a few days ago. It proposes to pre-
sent in picture and letterpress everything
you’d expect from a paper with such a title,
and it costs 6d.
The lino, may be trusted to get in some
impish work sometinnes, but it remains a
mystery how this passed the reader. A few
weeks ago a prominent citizen died in an
Australian capital and at the funeral service
the preacher paid a feeling tribute to the
fine qualities of the deceased. “Now he is
gathered to his fathers,” ran one sentence,
“we who mourn his loss must remember that
those who died were gone from their loved
ones for but a brief space.” In next morn-
ing’s daily the penultimate word appeared as
“fried” !
“Survivor”: Passing along Flinders-street
(Melb.) the other day I noted that the build-
ing in which the late lamented Evening
Standard was started had just been turned
into a wine and spirit store, to be run in
connection with Young and Jackson’s. Prior
to this it was a fislishop. The Standard
amalgamated with the Herald on October
31, 1894. There arc a few of us surviving
who still deplore the demise of the sheet on
which we gained our first metropolitan ex-
perience. We didn’t get big pay, but we
were a happy family under the leadership of
the late Sam Whittaker, chief of staff and
fine fellow.
Newspaper men in country towns have a
way of becoming pooh-bans, but there are
not many who do it so thoroughly as A. A.
George, of Hastings (M.L.). He is, or has
been, a member of over 40 organisations.
He has been a mayor, he is a J.P., he is
president of one club and vice-president of
four; secretary of four concerns, a fire-
brigade lieutenant, an honorary trumpeter,
bandmaster to three bands, and conductor
of two musical societies, a P.P.G.M. of the
Oddfellows, life member of four organisa-
tions and founder of two others. Besides
being a printer and a journalist, he is evi-
dently also a joiner.
“Curlew”: I received my first Bulletin
cheque when I was in gaol. The payment
was for some bush verses I had forwarded
from a shearing-slied on the Warrego (Q.).
Soon after we cut out there our big strike
occurred, in connection with which a score
or two of us “did” three years. I was one of
the early birds, and my correspondence fol-
lowed me from the Warrego endorsed “Try
St. Helena Gaol,” the handwriting being that
of the last squatter for whom I had handled
wool. I remember him as a fine, bearded,
burly 14-stone bushman, who later on was
president of the Pastoralists’ Association,
and ended sadly. My jingle appeared after-
wards in “The Bulletin Reciter,” and I
got for it another cheque which caught up
to me in the mulga country of W.A. about
the end of last century.
“Morohead”: If a plebiscite were taken
to discover the most popular feature of the
Sydney Sunday Sun, “Ginger Meggs,” the
red-haired hero of artist Jimmy Bancks’s
weekly comic page, would probably romp
home first; and not by virtue only of the
juvenile vote either. “The Sunbeams Book,”
published annually, contains the most out-
standing exploits of the effervescent Ginger
throughout the year, and is especially suit-
able for Christmas stockings. Bancks deserves
his success. A dozen years ago he was a
very junior clerk in a woolstore, and with
domestic responsibilities hesitated to throw
up his job until The Bulletin guaranteed
him a certain amount of work while he
studied and practised art. He both studied
and practised hard, and The Bulletin gave
him its blessing when he was able to accept
a full-time job with the Sun.
“Avon”: When the news reached Maori-
land that the Sydney Guardian had added
thousands to its circulation by a beauty
competition, the Stars of Auckland. Dune-
din and Christchurch and the Dominion
of Wellington arranged to syndicate a four-
province flutter, and for •weeks and weeks
they have been devoting pages to the por-
traits of nice young things. They don’t go
below the second rib as a rule —legs are
barred in the Wowsery Islands. Every now
arid then, by way of a change from repeating
the faces of the four girls whose friends and
relations have sent in most coupons, the
journals in the combine print the pictures
of charmers from other parts; and then the
elected ladies were sent touring round the
Dominion, and that meant acres more of
cheap copy. One or two old-fashioned gentle-
men have protested, but nobody has listened
to them.
“Lav”: Maoriland’s first newspaper
beauty competition led to a mix-up in Christ-
church. The Sun announced a contest to
find the most charming girl in Canterbury,
the prize to be a trip to Sydney. Next day its
evening rival, the Star, dug irito its 72-point
type-box to proclaim that it, too, was in quest
of the province’s most beautiful girl. The Sun
accused the Star of stealing its idea, and
the latter replied that its contest had been
organised for some time in conjunction with
the Auckland Star, Wellington Dominion
and Dunedin Star, the idea being to pick
provincial beauties first and then line them
up for the honor of being Miss Maoriland.
The two Christchurch contests finished about
the same time, and a bewildered public was
continually sorting out which Miss Canter-
bury was which. Motor firms, milliners and
toilet outfitters got into violent competition
for the honor of serving one or other of the
beauties, and the staid Cathedral City found
itself overwhelmed by newspaper stunting for
the first time in its history. Finally, when
the rival rags were getting to the “reptile
contemporary” stage, the Star put in a body
blow by announcing that its Miss Canter-
bury was the genuine article because the
Sun’s was an English girl who had been
in the .country only four years.


REX-PYE, packed in 11b. and
hygienic cans, in a delicious jelly, is the
tastiest treat cooked ready to serve,
and the most economical meat meal you
can obtain. You will find, as thousands
have found, that each tin is consistently
of the same outstanding choice quality.
This, due to the facts set out below,
accounts for the triumphal march of
REX-PYE into popular favor.

This is why we\claim that REX-PYE is the finest meat in the world:
; \ . - , .
1. The tin itself is unwjue, being stamped out and seamless; hermetically sealed without
solder (lead) or soldering flux—it is the perfectly hygienic container.
2. The meats (raw materials) are perfectly wholesome, being choicest quality, carefully
selected. Visitors frown abroad, inspecting our works, have said that the meats are
superior to those used'at any other factory in their experience.
3. The spicing by a recipe in our sole possession and the excellent jelly help to produce
the delicious flavor characteristic of REX-PYE.
4. The cooking en cas,'2role preserves all the wholesome meat juices, and retains the high
food values.
All these facts combine to produce a meat product of unrivalled quality. Thus we account
for that delicate aroma as yoT.\ open the tin, and that delicious flavor when the dainty is
eaten.
Ask your Grocer for REX-PYE

Look for the attractive label.
Imitations are offered for sale, but
they are decidedly not REX-PYE.

Its delicate aroma and delicious flavor

When Du Maurier wrote “Trilby” he
built his story around the mysteries of which
Aiesmer was the prophet; Paul Potter, adapt-
ing the play for the stage, centred his attem
tion on the bizarre Svengali, succeeding to
the extent of creating one of those grotesque
figures which live in drama because of the
hunger of great character actors for great
character parts. That is the only reason
why a poor play, walking on the stilts of
the Victorian period and containing its most
irritating stage conventions, should have sur-
vived in memory when scores of better ones
have been forgotten. The play was first
shown in Sydney at the Lyceum 30 years
ago, with Reuben Fax as Svengali and Edith
Crane as Trilby, and the latest of the few
productions of the old thrill —in one of them
our own Nellie Stewart figured—took place
20 years ago; yet the flurry around the
doors of the Criterion Theatre, when the
play was revived by Maurice Moscoviteh
last Saturday, indicated the interest of a
new generation to witness the revival. The
action opens in the Paris studio where an
assorted lot of Britons practise wit and
sloppy sentiment, whilst the calamitous
Svengali, gaining a sort of easy tolerance
on account of his musical abilities, wanders
in and out borrowing small sums of money
and weaving the cobweb of his hypnotic
powers over Trilby, the good-natured girl
who is pal and helper to her Bohemian
friends; and finally, just as William Bagot
(known to his friends as “Little Billie”)
is about to marry the lady, the malignant
genius kidnaps her under a hypnotic spell.
Although tone-deaf, she possesses a remark-
able voice, out of which Svengali can pro-
duce extraordinary results; although the
effort of control saps his life, he exults in the
triumph that her fame and the resulting
riches have brought to him. So the story
goes on to the death of Svengali, whereupon
Little Billie smiles again. The original ver-
sion provided an extra act for the death of
Trilby; but as, with Svengali finished, the
play loses its real excuse for being a play,
the up-to-date version is an improvement.
* * * *
Moscovitch’s Svengali was both dynamic
and artistic ; he conveyed an impression of the
pervasion of the malign powers of the semi-
maniac, even as he displayed his wrathful
pride in his gaunt poverty which made him
hate everybody down to those from whom he
cadged, and the struggle with sapped powers
in his prosperity was well indicated. George
Blunt, fitted with a good accent as Sandy,
was, with Alexander Sarner, who represented
Gecko, the best of a cast much less happy
than usual. Taffy (John Harper) suffered
spasms of stagey emotion, part of the emo-
tion being bent legs and hopeless hands; and
the Little Billie of Nat Madison was an
impersonation relieved from complete failure
only by the fire of his denunciation of Trilby
in the last act. Berkeley Ayris’s picture of
Little Billie’s uncle ought to have been better,
too. Ellen Pollock’s Trilby had too close a
resemblance to Amy in “They Knew What
They Wanted,” where that style was suit-
able ; she at no time lived up to the charac-
ter of a buoyant girl saturated in the spirit of
Bohemia. As Madame Vinard, Eileen Sparks
did well; Margaret Murray was a good
matron of another period as Mrs. Bagot.
From the wings Elsa Stralia provided the
voice of the hypnotised Trilby. The revival
is to run for only two more weeks; the Mos-
covitch co. is due in Maoriland for Christ-
mas.
The casual visitor who arrives anywhere
about curtain-rise still finds it difficult to
get a seat to view “Rose Marie”; even the
matinees at Sydney Majesty’s are crowded.
It seems a wise decision to continue the suc-
cess through the Christmas season. “Abie’s
Irish Rose,” at the Royal, and “Is Zat So?”
at the Palace, are also running strongly in
public favor; hut “Betty Lee” is on the
eve of farewelling in order to release those
of its members who are wanted for the
Fullers’ pantomimes. “Jack and the Bean-
stalk” takes possession of the St. James
on December 18. Ada Reeve, who during
last week was absent through illness —
Eileen O’Motley stepped into her shoes- —will
cease to glitter in “Spangles” at the Grand
Opera House after this week. The G. 0.11.
goes into a three weeks’ recess in preparation
for the Williamson panto.

Thanks to the phonofilm the way of the
politician is being made too terrible. At a
private hearing of this remarkable inven-
tion in Sydney last week, attended by the
State Governor, Sir Joynson Hicks, Home
Secretary, was seen and heard delivering a
speech in England. In the future the Aus-
tralian electioneering candidate may be able
to appear and speak simultaneously at every
street corner, and the citizen driven to des-
peration won’t get much satisfaction even if
lie plasters the screen with electioneering
eggs. It was a politician, T. J. Ley, M.P.,
who gleefully announced the coming of this
new terror. At the private hearing the cries
of the farmyard, the, clamor of a political
crowd, the noises of machinery and instru-
mental music were faithfully rendered; but
the human voice is heard through cotton-
wool. If the invention is to succeed, more
attention must be paid to the acoustics of
picture-theatres. The difference between a
phonofilm heard at the Prince Edward and
within a studio draped with curtains was
very marked.

Sydney Players’ Club, which has very
serious aims, unbent the other evening and
treated a throng of well-wishers that filled
St. James’s Hall to a performance of A. A.
Milne’s comedy “To Have the Honor.” If
is the sort of drawing-room piece that Milne
does so well, and that amateurs usually do
so badly. But the worst fears of pessi-
mists were not realised. The best laughs
in the dialogue were dug out with vast suc-
cess, and both players and played-to found
the evening too short. Honors went to Renee
Kelly, who gave the show some of its pro-
fessional stiffening, and to Clive Coppard
and Wynne Whear Roberts; these two, when
they warmed up, were very entertaining.
The best-looker in the cast was Adeline
Tudehope, and the most promising youngster
of the bunch Brenda King. There were
ragged edges, when action and dialogue came
to a dead stop and the voice of the prompter
was heard, but a tiny theatre with impro-
vised stage-lighting magnifies such faults.

If only Leopoldi, who came to Sydney
Tivoli on Monday, was as distinct in his
patter as he is clever in his changes his
turn would be remarkably fine. As it is, the
act goes well, in spite of the blemish. Leo-
poldi is a walking wardrobe who, with a
flick, changes what he is wearing to some-
thing else; it is cleverly worked. His sub-
sequent impersonation of various musical
conductors is also neat. The audience didn’t
know Meyerbeer and others, but it was at
home with Sousa, whose arrival brought
forth yells. The Aerial Smiths provide some
thrills high up amongst the sky borders;
Salerno is back again, and Don Alfonso
Zelaya continues to show that there are
much better things in the world than jazz.
“BETTY LEE,” AT
SYDNEY ST. JAMES.
Bertie Wright as Larry Glass, and George
Willoughby as Cowboy Wolf.
The best thing in Moon and Morris’s dish
of nonsense for this week is a -scene which
gives Nell Fleming a chance as a lively
young wife determined to desert her hus-
band. The combination keeps up a good-
supply of humor with a commendable change
of material every week. It’s rather a pity
that Harold Waldon, who performs mildly at
the piano, can’t ring the changes a bit
also. Estelle Rose is an “impressionist”
whose cheerfulness makes up for the poorness
ot some of the impressions; possibly the dis-
arming manner in which she told the audi-
ence that she did not deserve the applause
she had received for one of them is an ex-
planation of her popularity.
** * *
Minor art shows :
Mahdi McCrae has a show at the Sydney Art
Salon, Fuller’s Buildings, which no doubt will have
an appeal on account of its bizarre character. The
young lady is a very young lady yet; later she
may not so despise drawing as a factor in making
pictures. At present, for the main part, she merely
impressionises, though she does it with considerable
facility and imagination, and is not greatly concerned
whether the child is 12 feet high or merely so
many inches. Many of her efforts will make attrac-
tive wall decorations —people will at least ask who
the artist is.
On the sixth floor of the staid Manufacturers’
Building in O’Connell-street a small collection of
black-and-white drawings and water-colors has been
hung by two young men, Eric G. Thompson, who
has won an architectural scholarship and is going
to America, and T. Eric Cooper. Thompson spent
MELBOURNE TIVOLI.
“Jerry and co.” as burlesque carpenters.
a couple of months in Noumea, and made good use of
his time ; the pictures are interesting for their sub-
ject matter alone. A picture of “Firholm, Parra-
matta,” one of that district’s oldest houses, is the
best of the local drawings. Thompson’s colleague
has a number , of studies of architectural subjects,
several of them taken in Europe. The color em-
ployed is more by the way of helping the archi-
tectural effect than of painting pictures. It is a
neat and interesting show.
* * * *
The search for the week’s best picture:—
It was for its picturesque glimpses of Old England
in the times of the Prince Regent, rather than for its
excitements, that “The Amateur Gentleman” of the
Jeffery Famol novel pleased this Showman at the
Lyric and Strand theatres (Sydney). Delightful
scenes of old inns and beautiful lanes are contrasted
with the high life of the dandies, in which the fat
Prince Regent prominently figures. The story tells
of an innkeeper’s son who inherits a fortune and
determines to become a gentleman, but succeeds only
in becoming an amateur at the game and is well con-
tent with the reward of the heroine’s hand. Though
the hero has many adventures on the broad highway,
his ultimate success in society is achieved by his
exquisite invention of a new cravat. The London
street-life of the period is admirably pictured. As
the hero Richard Barthelmcss portrays the youthful
adventurer with vigor and sincerity.
That pretty pendant on history, the unforgettable
story of Nell Gwyn, is admirably adapted to the
resources of the cinema. Translated to the present
age, it would perhaps shock us; but the screen’s
own special limitations remove the story of Sweet
Nell to a tale of “Once upon a Time.” And yet
it has its truth; the motion-picture shown at the
Lyceum and elsewhere has the advantage of a fairy
tale come true, as the producer wantonly closed
the play with a picture of a group of modern pen-
sioners of Chelsea, whose present existence is due
to Nell Gwyn’s sympathy for the soldiers broken
in the wars. There is one scene in this chapter
of history, the death of King Charles and the acces-
sion of James 11., with poor Nell’s reign finished, that
the screen displays with a deep poignancy. As
Sweet Nell, Dorothy Gish was a vivacious and
delightful heroine, though her features fail some-
times in her efforts to “register” grief. The pic-
ture, however, is of an extremely high standard
throughout; and with all the decrying of the British-
made picture, the charming little masterpiece was
produced in its entirety in England.
* * ;!= *
The legs of Renee Kelly and the imbecili-
ties of Antony Holies are providing what wit
and action are to be found in “Browm
Sugar,” the condiment at present served at
Melbourne King’s. “Meet the Wife” is meet-
ing the rent at the Athenaeum: and at the
Palace “What Happened to Jones” gives
place to “Charley’s Aunt” on Saturday—only
a Rip van Winkle or a playgoer of exces-
sively tender years 'will need an intro, to the
lady. In scores of barns and suburban back
rooms choristers and soloists are more or
less secretly engaged preparing their ora-
torios for the Christmastime bombardment
of the pearly gates. The Oriana Madrigal
Society will send its shock troops to the
assault on Dec. 7 at the Auditorium, when
Bach’s “Jesu, Priceless Treasure,” and Pales-
trina’s “Stabat Mater” will obey W. C.
Frazier’s baton. Despite the assertion of
the latest jazz orchestra conductor to arrive
from U.S.A. that the music of the Masters
must be syncopated to be made palatable to
a modern audience, Backliaus gave no less
than 11 exhibitions of his severely classic
muse, and they were all abundantly attended.
That other classic, the Greatest Show on
Earth, has at last departed from its haunt
at Wirtlis’ Olympia and is now rushing from
one country town to another en route for
Sydney, like a scheduled comet or a populated
meteor bound to a time-table.
“Wildflower” was given loud welcome at
the Melbourne Royal on Saturday, when
Marie Burke donned once again the accent
and clothes of Nina, the Italian peasant who
won fortune by curbing her temper. The
dark-eyed maiden sings and acts, with the
same charm as of old, and Herbert Browne,
as the lover, is as faithful and tuneful as
ever; and Gus Bluett and Marie La Varre
again amuse themselves and their audience.
Paul Plunkett is a newcomer in the role of
Alberto and is happily placed, but Linda
Foy makes but a colorless Bianca. Frank
Hawthorne, as the old Luigi, and Charles
Zoli, as the attorney, deserve a word of
appreciation.
* * h* *
At the Princess Theatre (Melb.) the prin-
cipal attraction is “The Only Why,” an Eng-
lish film adaptation of the old melodrama
based on Dickens's “Tale of Two Cities”
that set Australasian audiences weeping a
quarter of a century ago. The cast is headed
by Sir John Harvey, and includes Betty
Faire and Madge Stuart, and the photo-
graphy is as good as the acting. Young
Australia supplies laughter in the first half
of the programme, in which Frances Scully's
panto, children play “The Wedding of Baby
Kerr.” The dancing and acrobatic stunts
of the tiny tots bring down the house, and
the wee bridegroom scores heavily in a comic
song, “Some ’Am, a Negg and a Nunion.”
Marie Crowther and Gladdie Cave are clever
dancers of a little older growth who help
to make the show a credit to its producer.

The performance of “A Night Out” at
His Majesty’s (Melb.) on Saturday was the
first of a series of revivals that are to be
staged by Maud Fane before she departs for
England and a contract. The brightest,
thing about the resurrected piece is the
comedy Avork of George Gee as Joseph
Pinglet, but Maud Fane as Marcelle is well
in the picture. Cecil Kellaway creates
amusement as an elderly gentleman of quiver-
ing limb and speech. /Some of the dances of
the second act could with advantage be
transplanted to the first, which moves rather
slowly. “The Wooing of Frinette,” in which
Thurza Rogers and Robert Lascelles star, is
an artistic treat, /j
* •* * *
Melbourne Majestic’s flow of fiction this
week includes one’ of those stirring stories
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police which
give the impression that the first require-
ment of a bobby in those parts is an ability
to make romantic love to a fascinating gal
while the villain, with both legs and his
spine broken, (quivers vindictively in the
middle distance. A British industrial film
depicting how the nation’s telegrams are
speeded on their way is an interesting extra.
A powerful (attraction at Hoyt’s emporium,
in a film called “The Blind Goddess,” is
Louise Dre/siser as an erring mother. Screen
mas are usually beacons of virtue or guiding-
lamps, so inhere is a refreshing air of novelty
about this picture, as well as a court scene
full of thrills.
'* * *
More paint shows in Melbourne :
M. J. MacNally, who has lately pitched his
tent in Sydney, shows a couple of dozen
water-colors at the Decoration Galleries. They are
pleasant, nicely-balanced compositions filled with sea
and bush. In one or two instances, flat decorative
effects have been aimed at, and the results are
happy.
• Ha Rentoul Outhwaite’s pictures of the fairies
will be a feature of the Galleries for a few days now.
The 30 oils which constitute George Colville’s
li/ctle show at the Sedon Galleries are mainly
devoted to impressions of picturesque nooks and
/corners in the Apple Isle. Colville slapdashes his
colors about without very much consideration for
people who have old-fashioned ideas concerning art.
Yet he knows how to paint, and perhaps when he
is older he will paint so well that quite ordinary
people will be able to understand him.

Something quite unusual in pictures is
Cobham’s across-Africa flight, shown at
Adelaide Wondergraph, and the public came
at it in a way that suggests a real chance
in Australia for something better than
American cowboy romances. There is . a
British flavor, too, even about Dorothy Gish
at the York, since she retells the old story
of Nell Gwyn. Wondergraph has Adolphe
Menjou, varying from barber’s chair to fash-
ion-plate, an odd sort of up-to-date Beau-
caire. At West’s there is a “Graustark”
romance, Ruritanian and exciting; and at
the Pav. Mary Pickford is having a second
innings of her calculated cleverness in “Spar-
rows.” The Royal has a week of Variety;
the main item is Santrey, guiding the orches-
tra from which he gets such amazing effects,
with incidental bits of brilliant acting by
Anna Seymour.

Two Victorian water-colorists in Adelaide :
Carlyle Jackson has a small show at the Durxster
Gallery. He has dropped any Hilder influence
formerly apparent, and now does work recalling the
English water-colorists of a century back. His recent
operations have been mostly in Tasmania, with
special attention to Campbelltown and Ross (church
and bridge). But it is a Goulburn Valley scene
that has taken the fancy of the National Gallery
of S.A.
R. W. Sturgess, in the press of shows, has had
to And hanging room at Foy and Gibson’s, who
have contrived a well-lighted gallery. He jumps
from Power-lilte horses to landscape, and thence to
delicate fancies distinctly Hilder-like. Cowell, a
local connoisseur, owns a dozen of them, and the
rest went off rapidly, the Art Gallery buying two
and Governor Bridges another.
As short stories and verse pour into The
Bulletin office during the year, the best is
put aside for the Christmas number, so that
outsiders (and insiders) may see. what Aus-
tralia really can do and is doing in the liter-
ary and artistic way. Over 50 writers are
represented and half as many artists; and
The Bulletin is proud to have got such a
fine company of contributors together. The
Christmas number is to be sold at the same
old sixpence, and will be on the bookstalls
and at all agencies throughout Australia and
Maoriland on Saturday, December 11.
“L.H.P.”: In the music section of the
new “Australian Encyclopaedia” Rose Hersee
is given as the Josephine and Armes Beau-
mont as the Ralph of “Pinafore” in the first
J. C. Williamson production at Sydney
Royal. The Josephine was Maggie Moore,
and Vernon Reid was the tenor sailor.
“Patience” is credited to 1883 —the date
should be 1881—and Alice Rees was the
original milkmaid, not Nellie Stewart. The
FIRST CHORUS-GIRL (after rehearsal ): “She
knows her lines all right .”
SECOND DITTO : “Yes, and she wears her
dresses to show them of, too!”
“Encyclopaedia” also says that Nellie started
her operatic career in 1885; but by that
date she had played, from 1880, nearly 20
principal prima donna roles with the Trium-
virate’s Royal Comic Opera co. “La Gio-
conda” is given as one of the operatic novel-
ties of 1901; but Ponchielli’s opera was first
given in 1886, by Martin Simonsen’s Italian
opera co.
Poverty
Point
“Hamfat”: The Fullers are going to in-
dulge in an orgy of panto, this year—“ Jack
and the Beanstalk,” with Elsie Prince as
Jack, will be at the St. James Theatre; “Cin-
derella,” which was last year in Sydney
at the Hippodrome and the year before a<
the New Princess, Melbourne, is to be given
a turn at the Newtown (Sydney) Majestic;
“Puss in Boots” will ahiuse the kids from
7 to 70 at the New Princess, Melbourne;
“Robinson Crusoe” is the Brisbane venture
at the Empire; and at the Majestic, Adel-
aide, “Mother Goose” is expected to lay
golden eggs. The J.C.W. firm has lost its
enthusiasm for the old-time Christmas
amusement, but “Aladdin” will be at the
Sydney Grand Opera House.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: The panto, rush this
year will show some of the vagaries of the
wheel of time in the people employed by
the various shows. “Mo” (Roy Rene), one
of the foundations of the Fuller fortune,
will be with the Williamson frivolity; it
will also give a leading r6le to that advanc-
ing little Australian, Floie Allan. Edna, a
sister of Gladys Moncrieff, will have a good
show, and Andrew Higginson, formerly asso-
ciated with other kind of work, is in the cast.
Billie Lockwood, who as a girl was a Lee
White-Clay Smith discovery a few years
ago, is also included in a prominent place.
Phil Smith, the comic light of J.C.W. musi-
cal comedies of a decade ago, will be with
the Fullers’ Melbourne panto., which will
also include Eileen Castles, who formerly
was given a lead by the Firm; and Reg
Hawthorne, a solid “legitimate” man, is
associated with the production. Jim Gerald,
who will make the chief laughter, and Lance
Vane, one of the other principals, are
brothers —sons of the old-time S. A. Fitz-
gerald. Little Gladys Hermes, who did good
work with the Josie Melville productions,
has also gone over to the Fullers. She is in
the Sydney panto.
“Evaclar”: Melbourne Repertory Society
will hold a big pow-wow on December 6 to
thresh out an offer made by J. and N. Tait.
The society is asked to undertake to enrol
500 members in the first year and an addi-
tional 200 in the second. Three guineas a
year will entitle suboribers to two reserved
seats for each of five plays, or a guinea and
a half will buy one back stall seat for the
performances. Plays and players are to be
selected by Gregan McMahon, as director;
and the Taits for their part undertake to
bear all expenses of production in return for
all receipts and subscriptions. They will
provide a club room, too, for members and a
library of plays. There seems to be a pretty
general disposition to accept the offer,
although one hears a suggestion that the
society ought to at least have the right to
appoint a small committee to work witli the
director and share with him the responsibility
of selecting and casting plays.
“Yarra Ben”: The J. and N. Taits’ pro-
posal to take over and reorganise the Mel-
bourne Repertory under Gregon McMahon’s
direction has not been received by the
society with undiluted enthusiasm. One of
its associates goes so far as to question
the advisability or exchanging the present
stage-directors for McMahon, because, for-
sooth, he does not allow the budding Bern-
hardts and Irvings to give their own con-
ceptions of the parts entrusted to them. As
McMahon founded the Melbourne Repertory
and taught many of its present members —
including one of its producers —the business
of acting, the attack seems to be particularly
unjust, not to say darned ungrateful.
“Hamfat”: Allan Wilkie will recommence
business in the Shakspearean line on January
22, opening at Hobart; he will be back for
Christmas, but the rehearsals of his re-
formed co. will take r. few weeks. Easter
will see the show in Melbourne; Sydney’s
visit will come later.
“Hamfat”: The fortune-making “Rose
Marie” is still going so well in Sydney after
breaking every long-run record except that
of “Our Miss Gibbs,” which went for 32
weeks, that the Williamson management lias
decided to extend the season over Christmas
instead of superseding it with “Tell Me
More” for the holidays. Actually, in regard
A FINE BIT OF REALISM.
THE DRIVER : “I ’ear you ’ad one of them stranded actors down
at your place. Was ’e any good?”
THE PASSENGER: “Well, ’e was a dam’ good actor. I could often
’ave swore 'e was wo, kin’.”
to performances, “Rose Marie” will have
broken the record long before Christmas
arrives. In tlie days of “Our Miss Gibbs”
there was only one matinee a week, against
the two (with an extra one on a holiday)
that now prevail; and by the end of next
week “Rose Marie” will have scored 22S
performances.
“Ancient Prompter”: One of the best
actors in the American company now play-
ing “Is Zat So?” at Sydney Palace was born
in England. He is the six-year-old Bruce
Walker, who “speaks up” in a manner that
many an older mummer might envy—and
imitate. Bruce is the son of Martin Walker,
who arrived here to play juveniles with the
Bqucicault-V anbrughs, and later appeared
in several pieces with John O’Hara.
“Extra Turn” : Greek, the French clown,
one of the top-notcliers of vaudeville over-
seas and one of the highest-paid, is said to
be coming to Australia for the Tivoli circuit.
There can be no question of his being one
of the most expensive stars. He recently
informed a correspondent of an English
weekly in Paris that he was forced to remain
out of England because the income-tax com-
missioners were dunning him for £3OOO.
“Lud” : Susan Richmond, whose grotesque
characterisation of the middle-aged spinster,
Thirza Tapper, in Eden Phil]potts’s comedy,
“The Farmer’s Wife,” delighted Australian
audiences, has got a part in the same author’s
newest piece, “Yellow Sands,” at. London
Haymarket. Susan was one of Sir Barry
Jackson’s Birmingham Repertory Theatre co.
The scene of the piece is again set in Phill-
potts’s beloved Devonshire.
“Peter Pan” : The number of young Aus-
tralians who have gone to England and
secured/ good engagements is remarkable,
but Leslie Manners, a young Melbourne
mummer, has done more. He has gone into
management, and when the last mails left
was in the eighth week of a successful pro-
vincial tour with his co. He took an. Eng-
lish partner for advice as to local conditions.
Manners’s stage career began with Emilie
Polini in “De Luxe Annie”; later he became
a Romeo to the Juliet of Frediswyde Hunter-
Watts ; his last Australian appearance was
as Lorenzo in Moscovitch’s “Merchant of
Venice.” Three days after his arrival in
London he was engaged for a tour of
S’Africa in Freda Godfrey’s company. On his
return from Africa, his troubles began. After
several anxious months of “resting, a good
offer came to tour as “heavy in a dramatic
co. Twice through the provinces m this capa-
city impressed him with the opportunities,
and decided him to start out on Ins own.
“Blum”: Oscar Asche’s fortune literally
went to the dogs. He struck oil first m
“Kismet,” and then had a Shakspearean
season in Australia that didn t ran him.
His next big hit was ‘ Cliu Chm Chow, of
which he shouldered the responsibility of
authorship. During the five years London
run, he got £BO a week as an. actor and a
royalty income averaging five times as much.
Then came “Cairo,” and the plump gentle-
man, who was again author as well as stai.
washed up about £17,000 as the result m
one year at His Majesty s. .Then Australia
saw r both the yellow-skin dramas, and for
80 weeks Oscar drew £2OO every Friday. He
expected to get quite a lot more when the
tour was over, but it wasn t waiting.. When
he faced a Registrar in Bankruptcy in Lon-
don lately with a hiatus of over £27,000, lie
explained that he had lost £40,000 in run-
ning greyhounds at coursing meetings; and
the fact that he had been resting, with
the exception of one or two small jodj as
a producer, for the last two years, liadn t
helped. „
“Yarra Ben” : Amateur mummers, Reper-
torian and others, who aspire to beat the
pros, at tlieir own
p:ame should really
give a little more
attention to the
study of their
’lines.” At several
much-boomed ama-
teur performances
in Melbourne of
late the lapses of
memory amongst
the principals have
been flagrant. One
leading gentleman
w i tli admirable
sangfroid walked
directly to the
prompter’s side of
the stage whenever
he “dried up”—
which was often —
and coolly waited
to be supplied with
“the word.” That
sort of thing is, of
course, very amus-
ing to kind friends
in front; but the
paying public de-
serves a little more
consideration. Ama-
teurs take at least
six weeks to pre-
pare a piece, and
they should surely be able to get hold of the
dialogue in that time.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Mabelle Morgan, who
used to be a substantial feature of William-
son musical comedy shows, is still going
strong on the Clay vaudeville circuit, which
keeps four companies moving. Mabelle be-
longed to an era when theatrical, salaries
were much less than the public was led to
believe, and three-figure envelopes, which some
stars do really collect nowadays, were un-
known. During a court investigation of her
domestic affairs Mabelle Morgan divulged the
financial terms of her engagement. As second
woman in the show she had started on £3
per week, and had climbed up to £4.
“Spotlight”: Movies for children are now
being made in Australia, although an Aus-
tralian had to come back from 18 years of
exile in America to do the producing. He
is of the, old Australian Bedouin stage
family and bears its name; he has bought
already scenarios written by an Australian,
and is looking tor more. Middle Harbor
( Sydney) will next month be the scene of
the “shooting” of a wild adventure story
in which children are to be the performers.
“Nero” : “Caesar’s Ghost” has got lost in
the Woods (B. 25/11/’26). The gentleman
who is credited with taking so many liber-
ties with the English language was not
Leslie but Charlie, brother of Alfred, one-
time “dresser” to Charles Warner and later
manager and senior partner of the Woods-
Williamson co. I can vouch for some of
the stories told of Charlie. On one occa-
sion at tea in an out-back pub he was asked
by Alf Boothman, “Say, Charlie, is the
butter adjacent?” Putting the butter-dish
to liis nose he replied, “No, it smells all
right!” When Maud Williamson at rehear-
sal once expressed her intention of sending
her little daughter to a kindergarten, Charlie
said “I wouldn’t, Miss Williamson. What’s
the good of having a kid like that taught
Latin and Greek?” A Westralian paper
once said of him, “Charles Wood juggles
with the English language like a veritable
Cinquevalli.” Charlie showed the paper to
everybody, claiming it had compared him
with that eminent artist. Even his brother
Alf slipped a little in his pronunciation.
Night after night I have heard him, as John
Storm in “The Christian,” commence his
bullyragging of Canon Wealthy with the
words, “You perfess Christianity!”
CICADA JAZZ.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They have wasted three years
At the roots of the tree,
Imbibing the beers
That are frequent and free,
Till at last conies the urge
And the longings for love;
And the “locusts” emerge
To the gay life above.
A clamant desire
Brings them up from the earth,
They shed their attire
And break into mirth.
In the tall poplar-tree—
Their orchestra grand—
They tune up with glee
And join the jazz-band.
The conductor unseen
Lifts his baton. Be still!
And out from the green
The saxophones shrill,
The brass cymbals clang
With the kettle-drums as
With a crash and a bang
They break into jazz.
Dead silence again,
And stilled is the flute.
You listen in vain—
The orchestra’s mute!
No Charlestoning now;
The melody stops;
The band makes its bow;
The green curtain drops.

Never before in the history of Australia have the two great departments of finance been combined
in ONE Company. There are Motor Finance Companies and Cash Order Companies, but Motor
and Cash Orders, Limited, includes BOTH in its wide scope and its tremendous appeal for
business.
Contracts have been signed for the financing of £lOO,OOO worth of absolutely safe and highly
profitable business as soon as the capital is subscribed. This means that your money invested
to-day begins to earn profits to-morrow. No other finance Company has started business with
such a tremendous advantage.
When the first 100,000 Ordinary Shares are applied for and allotted, the Directors have the right
to declare a premium on subsequent shares. To-day they may be secured at £ 1 each. There are
no free shares issued to anyone. The holders of the first 1 00,000 shares will be offered the option
to take up at par value (namely, £1 ) within a certain time one share for every share held.
To establish a cash-order business for the sale of Furniture, Player Pianos Gramophones,
Farming Machinery, Tractors, Oil Engines, Launches, Wireless Apparatus, hootwear, Cloth-
ing, Drapery, .Jewellery, Millinery, Mercery, Stoves, Baths, Washing Machines, etc., etc.
Intending purchasers of motor-cars will also receive the benefits of the cash-order system,
never before offered in this country. The Company will make a special feature of this The
repute and financial stability of the buyer being assured, a cash order for the cost of the car
will be issued, which he will use as a cheque in payment to any motor firm on the Company s
list. The usual agreement will be entered into and the risk fully insured.
The Company will give financial assistance in the promotion and development of any com-
mercial enterprise or public utility where the security offered is absolutely sound Will also
lend money at interest on the approved security of any property, real or personal. Will dis-
count bills properly secured, act as agents on commission for the sale of motor vehicles,
arrange insurances and handle the renewal of premiums and policies.
The Daily Guardian, 12th October, 1926, states that in 1923 there were 70.000 motor
vehicles registered, and that given the rate of progress in the second half of this year as equal
to that of the first, there will be over 150,000 registered by the end of tins year. Furthei,
should the present increases be sustained there will be registered over -00,000 cars by the
end of 1930. This means, on a conservative estimate, that over £00,000,000 will be spent in
the ensuing four years in purchase alone.
So far as cash orders are concerned, the Sydney Morning Herald of 13th Nov.. 1920,
states, “In Australia, the cash-order system extends to the purchase of Millinery, Clothin„,
General Drapery, Mercery, Stoves, Baths, Electrical Goods. Wireless Apparatus, Boots and
Shoes. Optical Goods. Jewellery, Music, Gramophones, Saddlery and Harness even to attend
ance by dentists.” More and more and more people are purchasing their wants on the amaz-
ingly convenient cash-order system. On 10th August, 1926, the Sydney. Morning Herald
stated, “Judging by the known results of the working of similar companies, a satisfactoiy
return should be assured.”
In motor finance companies, one company has paid dividends ranging from 22 per cent, to
55 per cent, on its capital. Another company paid a dividend of 20 per cent. Another com-
pany, registered only last year, paid a 21 ner cent, dividend, while another, established
1923, disclosed a net profit of just over 70 per cent. A motor finance wmpany, register .
only this year, has already increased its capital from £lBl,OOO to £_oo,ooo to enable t
cope with its rapidly expanding business.
The profits of cash-order companies are also very high.. There are only two large companies
operating, the others being small, with insufficient capital. One company, established ml, i,
with a capital of £50.000 increased this to £270 by distributions from reserves, and has always
paid dividends of from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, per annum. Another company commenced
business in 1920 with a nominal capital of £50.000, now has a paid-up capital of £lOO,OOO and
reserves of over £40.000. In 1922 this Company issued £13,000 in free bonus shares. In
1924 they paid a dividend of 15 per cent, and 15 per cent, in bonus shares, and last year they
paid dividends and bonus equal to 374 per cent. Motor and Cash Orders, Limited, will receive
5 per cent, from the purchaser of the goods as well as a commission from the hrm supplying
the goods, so that it secures a profit both ends. The interest received from the customer on
a basis of 5 per cent, shows the Company a return of 24.76 per cent, per annum, on the capi-
tal employed. When we add to this the commission received by the company from the firm
supplying the goods the low average of 74 per cent., there is a further return of 3(.14 per
cent, per annum, which gives the Company n return equal to 61.90 per cent, on the capital
employed. If the Company pays the trader within two weeks after the cash order is issued,
the return on the capital engaged is not less than 80 per cent, per annum. When you add the
potential profits of the cash-order system to the potential profits of motor finance, you have a
combination of profit-earning power impossible to equal in Australian finance.

Opportunity for young graziers
to take up large areas
SUBDIVISION OF BRUNETTE DOWNS
Co-operative plan to settle 6,784,000 acres
rich grazing lands in Northern Territory
NO DROUGHTS SPLENDID CLIIVIATE
At last a sterling plan has been worked out by graziers of wide experience for settling the
great rich pastoral lands of the Barkly Tableland, in a way that will appeal to all interested in
our national problem of developing the North, and by young landless men with the spirit
and capital to tackle things in a big way. The Company has been formed to carry on a
Comprehensive Grazing Settlement Scheme by the subdivision of about 8440 square miles
into 73 grazing leases, leaving about 2160 square miles to be used and worked by the Com-
pany, which latter area will carry 200,000 sheep and 15,000 cattle, in the profits from working
which area all shareholders will participate. The area consists of undulating limestone Downs
and Plains, thickly grassed with Mitchell and Flinders, much of it carrying heavy growth of
wild lucerne in season. The Company while working its own area will provide oversight,
and management of purchased areas if desired. The Settlement of 73 areas will mean the
formation of a group of graziers with common interests which will be helpful to young
settlers. The whole plan shows wide vision on the part of the men responsible for it. Send
for a copy of Prospectus giving full particulars of estimated revenue, profits, etc.

Ordinary Shares of the nominal value of £325,000 are held in reserve for future issue when required.
The Company will be registered and the Directors will proceed to allotment when shares to the value
of £150,000 have been applied for.
€0 areas of 64,000 acres each for Sheep
13 areas of 128,000 acres each for Cattle
Subscribers of one or more of the above A. Ordinary Shares
will have the right of making application to the Company to
purchase one of the 73 Brunette Downs Leases at the pur-
chase price fixed for every one share taken.
The leases will be sold at 2/6 per acre for sheep areas and
!/- per acre for cattle areas on terms payable over a period
of 19 years at 5% interest on unpaid balances. The average
annual instalment, principal and interest, payable on a sheep
area of 64,000 acres works out at a rental of 1 £d. per acre
per annum for full term of 40 years, The rentals have
been fixed for full period, and cannot be raised.
The policy of the Federal Government has been to grant
financial assistance in approved cases of bona-fide settle-
ment for well sinking—advancing £l5OO for each successful
bore put down, such advance being repayable over ten
years.
It is confidently anticipated that this policy will be con-
tinued, and that no difficulty will be experienced by the
purchasers of blocks who wish to improve their holdings
In obtaining similar assistance from the Government, if it
be desired.
In arriving at the probable revenue to be derived from the
undertakings of the Company, all estimations of expenditure
have been taken at a maximum, while the calculated receipts
from sale of wool, sheep, and cattle have been estimated at a
minimum of the prices usually received. In spite of these
very conservative estimates it appears reasonable to fore-
cast that the Company can easily pay dividends of 15% on
Ordinary Shares, as well as make very material additions
to its reserves. At the end of the nine year period the Head
Station should be stocked with about 150,000 to 200,000
sheep.
Every leaseholder will participate in the profits and added
value of the growing assets of the Company. The individual
success of each leaseholder will bring also mutual benefit
to all, and the parent Company will be always ready and
willing to give the expert advice of its experienced managers
to any of the graziers established on the subdivision.
One £lOOO Share will entitle holder to apply for purchase of one of the 73 leases.
There is no opportunity in this limited space to give more
than a suggestion of the possibilities in the Co-operative plan
for making good profits and for doing valuable national
work.
The potentialities of the Barkly Tableland are immense. It
is the only portion of Australia with a rainfall averaging
18 inches, that can show such remarkable regularity, mak-
ing it ideal country for growing fine quality merino wool.
Taking everything into consideration—the term of lease, 40
years, with no resumption; and a fixed rental for the full
term; class of country and stock; water obtainable in in-
exhaustible supplies anywhere at shallow depths; regularity
of rainfall, and the large area of lake country, on which the
wild lucerne grows annually in abundance, rain or no rain
(the roots being down to the water), from July to end of
year, when the rainy season commences, make “BRUNETTE
DOWNS” one of the, if not the, safest and best investments
as a pastoral proposition in the whole of Australia.
These are the considered opinions of men with a lifetime of
experience in Pastoral work:—;
“The forming of a Company to acquire ‘BRUNETTE’ and make
it into a sheep country is an excellent project, and eminently
likely to be crowned with success. I have no hesitation in say-
ing that the bulk of this country is being wasted owing to the
fact that it is not fully stocked with sheep.” — C. J. McCallum,
late Gen. Manager for Edmund Jowett, Esq., and now Pastoral
Inspector for the Union Trustee Company of Australia, Ltd.
"Taking into consideration the rainfall, the good grazing quality
of the land, the shallow depth (about 250 feet) at which abun-
dant sub-artesian water can be obtained by boring—the long leases
available, and favourable conditions in respect to rent and tax-
ation, I know of no large area of sheep-grazing land in Australia
to compare with ‘BRUNETTE DOWNS.’ ” — C. W. Mitchell,
Inspector of Pastoral Lands for the Queensland Trustees, and
late Pastoral Inspector for the Union Bank of Australia.
"The idea of converting ‘BRUNETTE’ properties to sheep is, I
consider, an excellent one, and there is every reason to assume
that the business would prove a remarkably paying one. The
wonderful regularity of the commencement of the wet season is
a great factor towards the successful carrying of sheep on that
country.” — C. J. Brabazon, Elderslie, Winton, Queensland.

he wants one that is ACCURATE, one that is RELIABLE, and one that is SAFE TO HANDLE
The celebrated “WINCHESTER” Models 02 and 04 possess all these qualities. They
either the 22 short, long, long-rifle or extra-long cartridges —four different loads —with that
deadly accuracy for which the name “WINCHESTER” is world-famous. Their actions are so
simple and strong that there is nothing to get out of order. The bolt action closes right over
the head of the cartridge and protects the shooter from any risk of blowbaeks. And these

T.G.W.: No kick in it; just tlie wail of
a nice girl who thinks herself in love. .. . A.D.S.:
Have to know something about it first.... M.L.C.:
We will see whether such a scheme is practicable
here. Incidentally, don’t believe everything you
lead in that b00k.,...01d Blue: Give it a little more
elbow-grease. With rhymes so scarce, none should
be faulty. The idea’s good. . . .E.M.G.: The end :s
quite unworthy of the girls’ efforts —that part is
done we 11.... Pearl E. R.: Started well, but turned
itself into a plain narrative of a brutal driver kill-
ing a horse... .C.M.F.: When we read “He felt he
must change his rabbits” our interest rose. Alas,
it was only your bad writing ! Anybody can change
his habits R.W.A.: Hugh fails to impress
1».E.: Sob-story. Might do elsewhere... .M.L.L.:
Pale fragments G.T.: Yarn wants re-casting—it
gets its real climax in the middle... .E.R.R.: The
evidence is inconclusive.... Quiz: The ghost of a
story that might have been.... J.G.: A few good
lines; but they got into very poor company
E.J.M.: You might make “Penalty” fit....M.5.:
Good idea badly mangled in your verse-sausage
machine Peggy R.: Tomato-sauce verse provided
no relish... .C.L.R.: The Christmas rush of pathetic
kid stories is in full torrent now. Yours is far from
the best G.J.8.W.: Dull enough for Sunday-even-
ing reading in a Hardshell household... .Emel: A
commonplace episode... .T.L.A.: Glad “the new hand
laughed.” He’s the only one likely to get a chuckle
cut of it S.G.: The old-boot verses are thrown
out C.J.H.: The long story might be worth a
paragraph J.G.P.W.: Probably a sign that they
qualified for the final reading. If accepted, payment
will follow. Don’t care for “Oats”... .Joan A. R.
You are a cheerful young lady... .G.L.M.: Probably
a good joke to those who know the hero, but short of
general interest Pat: “Christmas in the Bush”
is indigestion in verse... .Gladys D.: Unrelieved sob-
stuff ... .C.M.C.: Sea song just fails; too slight....
Y. 8.8.: Neat; but a mere sugar-plum.... E.L.J.:
Awkward verses; they could be smoothed a bit. The
stories went very close D.F.8.: Gurgling outburst
about your discovery, after trying them all, that
Australian girls are the best kissing partners. Does
not rise above commonplace... .D.M.R.: Don’t care
for it. “The Whale” flounders Julius C.: Your
corpse happens very suddenly.... Tom L.: Like the
foolish married man, the duplicity has been done
too often J.M.S.Y.: Terrible crimes are committed
in the name of Patriotism —especially in verse
M.S.: It’s a masterpiece in its way :
Alas? Poor plant. Pot-bound
And wilting
In the turgid air that in this lunch-room lags,
Reluctant to depart.
With fronds forlornly drooping,
Dog-eared and still,
And lost to hope.... Palm!
What dastard hand did first immure thee
In thy „ pot of delf?
Did pluck thee from thy cool and sandy soil,
AVhere moisture fed
Thr r roots ?
Ah !
’Tis .as I thought.
I lift thee pot and all;
And from the rounded aperture beneath
One pallid rootlet peeps,
In search of wh'at it may not find
Within its prison circumscribed —
Moisture! !
Pat: Australian XI verse stumped. . . .A.IA :
The fact that love is glorious and lpss of it painful
has to be given some new twist to succeed....
S.F.C.: Too rough... .A.McM.: The pains of fabri-
cation are too evident. .. .Pat W.: Try to polish
“Night.” Lines that come in like a raw recruit
changing step spoil it....R.P.: Thought is too
slight, and expression awkward. ... .J.G.L.: You seem
to be chasing an idea you never quite catch....
C.A.S.: To put your dog into verse like that is
cruelty... .L.C. (M.L.) : The lines are awkward and
express nothing new... .Pioneer: Some of the verses
were shaped with an axe that wants sharpening....
J.S.A.: Ponderous sonnet has fallen downstairs....
Marie S.: Acquitted on account of youth.... F.J.S.:
Pleased to learn that “Barnswell was rich beyond the
dreams of average”... .R.R.: “The floral sighs they
sigh” are not for The Bulletin’s pink ear
G, Clef: The last bar sounded more like a pub in
disorder than a musical phrase. .. .S.H.M.: You
might succeed—with something much shorter....
C.J.M.: Phryne’s reverie tangles itself horribly.
There’s the same tendency in the other effort.. . .
L.L.8.: Cheerful but ineffective. “A-bloom” and
“a-humming” were all right, but when we came to
“a-twinkling,” “a-gazing,” and all the rest, we
began to think the a-habit overworked. .. .M.K.:
Your stockman’s vigil is just weariness. .. .D.S. :
Sketch is a mere reverie; try a story... .D.J.H.:
The mere shadow of nothing. .. .Rex F.: You say
it’s original. Glad to know no-one else is to blame.
.. . .T. 5.8.: A weak imitation of Sir Thomas Wyatt’s
“I am that I am, and that shall I be.”....Q.
Cumber: Idea good; requires lighter treatment....
Manobie: The Love-rose’s thorn has pricked too
many fingers... .T. 5.8,: Your verses need a plane
and some veneer... .T.W.E.: Pale little story died
from a uremia Eric A. J. S.: The sea verse ploughs
heavily through the waves... .Pea R. A. N.: Buried
with the respect due to their grey hairs... .C.J.8.W.:
It’s happened so often elsewhere that even the
Samoan venue doesn’t make it new... .F.G.R.: No
reason to immortalise an ordinary camp-fire yabber.
Ada R.: Dear lady, we are not interested in
titled females in England who make up their minds
to marry castles.... Muggins, Jun.: Too vague and
general. .. .P.T.F.: Not quite; it isn’t much of an
ending. .. .S.W.A.: If the morning behaves like that
in your district, what must the night-before be?
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
F.T.: The puzzle is how the car ever reached
the 55th milestone.... G.H.: A fine collection of
imperfections.... J.K.: It’s toddling back to where
it was shoved out into a cold w0r1d.,.. .J.J.P.:
We’ll sign the pledge if we continue to see appari-
tions like that R.C.H.: “Checkmated” didn’t go
far P.C.: Sour-appletree has the trunk of a
century-old English oak... .G.T.H.: Your characters

Drink ENO
and revel in the Sunshine
Of course, we all love sunshine. Sunny days are the
making of a holiday. But there s the heat! Some of us do reel
it rather badly.
When the heat becomes oppressive, when you have hardly
energy enough to enjoy the sunshine —then ENO s bruit Sait
nuts fresh life into you.
Just a ‘dash’ of this famous saline m a glass of water and you
have a delicious, sparkling health-drink that cools, refreshes and
relieves that parched, dry feeling. The invigorating effects or
ENO are real and lasting—because it does more than ordinary
cooling drinks can do. ENO tones up the whole system, purities
the blood and thus enables you to withstand the unaccustomed
conditions of strong air and high temperatures.

Quality: De Reszke
In these few words is summed up the case for the
cigarette that has created a record demand in record
time. People have only to hear of the existence
of the new De Reszke Virginias to want to try
them. And the verdict of their palate fully
justifies their faith.
Every cigarette that bears the name DE RESZKE
must needs be the very best in its class ; otherwise
the “ goodwill ” value of the name—at present
beyond compute —would be endangered. That is
your guarantee that the new De Reszke Virginias
will always preserve their high quality.

“Borom” : We ought to know more about
the extraordinary wastage of seed-wheat. A
ton of seed-wheat contains from 600,000 to
1,000,000 grains, yet considerably less than
250,000 plants are developed, without any-
thing to indicate what has become of the
remainder. It cannot be failure in the pro-
cess of germination, for extensive tests have
proved that the grains which do not develop
as plants amount to less than one per cent,
of tJie whole. When ground in which wheat
has been planted is examined in order, to
determine the fate of these missing grains,
no sign of them is found, and apparently all
the seeds are growing. If this mystery were
solved a saving would be effected that in
the course of a few years would represent a
large sum.

“Elsinore”: The Norwegian whaling-ship
N. T. Melsen-Alsonso is the largest of her
type and the most modern in the world.
Also, .she is the largest merchant ship under
the Norwegian flag and the first whaler to
seek whales in the neighborhood of Adelie
Land. She can also claim to be the deepest-
laden ship to leave any Australian port.
W hen she left Queen’s pier, Hobart, she was
drawing 32ft. Gin. forward and over 34ft. 3in.
aft, giving a mean draught of 33ft. 3in. She
could not have been safely berthed at any
other wharf in Australasia with the excep-
tion of Woolloomooloo and Walsh Bay, Syd-
ney. The maximum depth at Sydney along-
side the wharves is 42ft. At Melbourne the
maximum depth at Williamstown is 34ft. In
Adelaide 33ft., at Brisbane 30ft. In M.L.
the maximum depth at the deepest of the
wharves in Auckland is 30ft., Wellington
31ft. and Port Chalmers 30ft.
“My daughter is talcing up the law.”
“Ah, my old girl is always laying it down.”
“Adelaide”: Some more nails have been
knocked into the coffin of the scheme for
widening Gawler-place, a thing which Good-
man of the Tramways Trust has warned the
Adelaide City Council “will certainly have
to be done some day, and the longer you
leave it the more it will cost.” Gawler-place
is one. of the north-to-south thoroughfares
that Light unaccountably forgot to provide
when laying out the city. Though it is a
mere lane, commerce has settled on it, and
it is now congested. But local tradesmen
have given up hope of the widening, and the
two Bundle-street corners have lately had
big buildings run up on them. The Oriental
Hotel has just given a big figure for further
frontage, and a big Claridge House is to fill
up all the space to Harris, Scarfe’s. To
tackle the other side would mean asking the
Y.M.C.A. and D. and W. Murray (in
particular) to have their ornate building
fronts shaved off. As Goodman foresaw, the
work becomes more difficult every year, just
as it becomes more inevitable.

“ J.D.C. ’: The damage to sewers occa-
sioned by waste matter from Homebush
(Sydney) Abattoirs is only one reason of
many why w e should adopt the natural
course of doing all killing in country centres.
The present trouble is a natural outcome of
centralisation methods, and causes an enor-
mous annual loss. Fat stock, on the average,
travel four or five days to reach the railway,
and will start to fret from the day they leave
their home paddocks, even if there is plenty
of feed on the route. This, with a train
journey of 24 hours or upwards, and a day
or two hanging about the saleyards and abat-
toirs, will result in a loss of from 41b. to 71b.
in a sheep of 501 b. dressed weight. Meat
delivered from the shops in Sydney never
eouals the country-killed article for flavor
or nourishing qualities. Deduct an average
loss of even 41b. per head, plus a penny a
lb. for quality, and some idea may be formed
as. to what city killing costs annually. To
this add the cost of transport; about 85 to
live sheep make an average truckload,
and, apart from the bruising, loss of condi-
tion and actual deaths occurring in transit,
the untrucking, drafting and driving prior
to slaughtering are all arguments in favor
of country killing. With proper railway
facilities, at least double the number of car-
cases could be carried in present truck space
freights would be lower, the article delivered
would be infinitely superior, no wastage
would occur, and the present sewer trouble
would be entirely removed.

Writing with stylus

Ifl those ddys when writing was
laboriously done with a bone or bronze
stylus and on house walls instead of
paper, a gift of writing implements
might well have been a questionable
courtesy. It might have been considered
a sentence to hard labor l
How delightful, by contrast, is a

“i antas” : There are some queer methods
of travelling in the bush. I know one family
who often drive a buggy and two horses
15 miles or more with this passenger-list:
Dad, Mum and the six' girls in the buggy,
Jim and Dave riding the horses. They have
been doing it for years.
Anither Scot has bagged a job in Vic.
I)r. J. Bell Ferguson, who was strongly
backed by the big-wigs of the British Min-
istry of Health on the strength of his work
in England, has been appointed director of
t.b. activities in Melbourne for three years
at £lOOO a year with the right to private
practice.
“Odds On”: You may see some quaint con-
veyances carrying passengers to and from
Flemington on Cup Day, but this year must
have furnished the limit. In the swirl of the
returning-traffic I noticed a black-bearded
gent, driving a pair in a plumed hearse. The
passengers, who were on top, whiled away
the time by jocularly inviting pedestrians to
step inside.
“Kerys”: The visiting British _ M’s.P.
noticed more things about Australia than
the scenery, States’ debts and absence of
sinking funds. In N.S.W. one _ overseas
Labor man was a particularly interested
spectator at an unruly sitting in Macquarie-
street. Escaping outside he sought the
shoulder of a Tory fellow-traveller. “Look
at them,” he moaned, “they’re Labor. Think
of it — I'm one of them.”
“Black Tracker” : I have seen many mes-
senger-dogs but only one messenger-horse.
He belonged to a small farmer north of
Adelaide who lived three miles out of town.
A home-made pack-saddle was fixed on him
and secured to it was a letter-bag. The
farmer’s brother kept a store, which was
the messenger’s destination. In the bag
was the order, and when the goods were put
in the bags a signal was given for the horse
to get away. Invariably he did so at a
smart trot.
“J.S.L.” (Darwin) : “Homfrey Beale’s”
(B. 8/7/’26) friend is no stranger to me. I
know of one man who cannot keep a watch
going for any length of time; as a rule, at
the end of the week it is most erratic in its
timekeeping, gaining seconds every day and
within a month proving absolutely useless.
At first the man blamed the watchmakei*S (
but after he had spoilt a watch that had
belonged to his wife for eight years and
kept excellent time all through, he found
that he had to look to himself as the cause.
“Privateer” : The par. about a cheque that
remained presentable after going through
the wash (B. 21/10/’26) reminds me of a
mate o’ mine who was less fortunate. He
had cashed his cheque before arrival in
Sydney, and had its equivalent in iarge
denominations. Having heard of the wiles
of confidence-men and pickpockets, he placed
the whole issue in his boots, and then pro-
ceeded to see the sights. The pulp he took
out of his boots that night was turned into
currency all right, but only with great diffi-
culty.
“Ratio”: Hard by the road which winds
down the valley to Tatong (Vic.) a pic-
turesque cairn reminds the traveller that
Hume and Hovell once passed that way.
The Historical Memorials Committee now
proposes to dot with cairns the routes of the
hardy Scotsman, Angus McMillan, who
blazed the trail from the Monaro to Corner
Inlet, and of the adventurous Count Strzelecki.
One memorial will be established at Ensay or
Numbelamungee, McMillan’s jumping-ofi!
place. In schools along the route, other tab-
lets are to be placed. Incidentally, the fix-
ing of the precise river crossings has led to
the chronicling of much previously unre-
corded history gathered from the fast dis-
appearing Gippsland pioneers.
“AdeL”: The few remaining kings and
chieftains of once powerful mountain and
salt-water tribes in the Gulf Country are at
the present day a poor, dejected-looking lot,
wandering about begging, or unwillingly
working upon odd jobs on stations for tobacco
and old clothing. The remnants of their
tribes are being hounded from place to place.
They are not wanted where stock graze. The
i Queensland Government has reserved an ideal
area .for their benefit. This includes the
whole of the low-lying islands and coast
, to the tidal-water mark between Point Parker
and where the Queensland and N.T. border
reaches the sea. It is said to contain 194
souare miles, but probably 300 square miles
is nearer the mark —it was never sur-
veyed. In that part of the coast both bandi-
coots and wallabies are plentiful; fresh water
and sea-turtles abound; the salt arms and
sea water literally teem with dugong, barra-
mundi, salmon, groper, flathead, leather-
jacket, swordfish, and other smaller fishes;
water-fowl haunt the lagoons in countless
thousands. Yet in this blackfellows’ para-
dise live only a dozen niggers, all told. The
remainder prefer to linger in or about the
lands of their forefathers till v.d. or skin
and other diseases send them to early graves.
“Percy Pawnticket” : The furniture-remov-
alist has drawn some good payments from
me; but I retain pleasant memories of one
who never troubled to collect anything for
an exceptionally satisfactory piece of work.
He belonged to a Sydney North Shore clan
which has been connected with everything
from politics to bottles. As far as my job
was concerned, it was managed with such
celerity that when I arrived at the new pre-
mises, expecting to be in time to meet the
furniture and pay for the cartage, it was
long finished. Mrs. Pawnticket told me that
the rcmovalist had mentioned leaving a
parcel of his own in the wardrobe, and say-
ing he would take it away later. Next
morning a man came for the parcel, but
didn’t wait to collect payment for the job;
and I was never to hear anything more of
that liability. The newspapers of the day
reported that the police had received infor-
mation about a big parcel of smuggled
opium, acting upon which they had raided
the premises of a North Shore business man,
but had found nothing; and later I heard
that it was my friend the removalist whose
premises had been raided. Then I guessed
what my friend owed to the shelter of that
wardrobe. It’s the only time, to my know-
ledge, that I’ve had opium in the house; it
was about £BOO worth.

"My toes just can’t keep still
when Lopez plays a fox-trot.”
The Giant of Jazz!
WHEN Jazz first burst on an astonished world it was crude, rough,
disordered. Its producers did not understand it ; nor did the
players, nor did the public.
But a decade of development has made Jazz "something else again.” It fills its own
appointed place in the musical scheme of things. Now, there are many fine exponents
of Jazz, on the piano. And the greatest of them all is Lopez.
When this harlequin of the keyboard plays for the Ampico, his performance is caught
exactly, unerringly The re-enactment through Beale-Ampico is the real Lopez. Ask
him for an encore, when you will. He’ll give it again and again. Not a bar, not a
note, not a shading ever different from the original.
Great to listen to, greater still to dance to—jazz is a tonic and an exhilaration. Not till
you hear Lopez do you know it at its best. And he plays it only for the Ampico.
As fine a master in his own sphere as the leading exponents of the orthodox, Lopez is a
possession always within your reach. Use him, when and how you will. He’ll beat a
rhythm into your blood that will set your feet a-cruise on a blue sea of delight. He’ll
make you tingle with the joy of living.
BEALE-AMPICO
brings this priceless service to devotees of the dance, home-makers and others. It offers
all the latest dance music played by the ablest exponents o f rhythm, including (in ad-
dition to Lopez) Ferdie Grofe, Adam Carroll, J. Milton Delcamp, Ralph Reichenthal and
others who record their playing exclusively for the Ampico.
NOT ONLY DANCE MUSIC
Of course dance music is not the only thing that
the Beale-Ampico provides it brings also the
playing of the greatest pianists in the world,
Godowsky, Rachmaninoff, Levitzki, Ornstein,
Schnitzer and hosts of others.
INVITATION TO HEAR IT
It is impossible to describe the Beale-Ampico—
you must hear it to appreciate how marvellous it is
—come at your convenience and spend a pleasant
half hour listening to a programme of your own
choosing, in the Beale Salon or at any of our
Branch Addresses.
Exchange your piano for a Beale-Amptco
The Beale-Ampico may be yours to-day. A moderate initial payment, and the
value of your present instrument deducted from the price, and the balance
arranged on easy terms, makes possession of the Beale-Ampico possible for
almost anyone.

Princess Prue.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
a'\ \ T EEP not at your window, Princess
X\ Prue,
▼ T For the Little Brown Men are
calling you ;
And the loves of earth are as breaths that
pass
O’er the tarnished frame and the mirror’s
glass.”
Only the big owl saw her stir
When the Little Brown Men were calling
her!
The owl was nigh to the rick of hay;
lie had hid in the dark loft all the day;
But he left the roof of the farmer’s house
For a midnight meal on a luckless mouse;
And he lurked in the shadow against the
tower
That made a shield to the royal bower.
Princess Prue was gowned in white;
She looked like a lily left to the night
In a sheltered nook of a garden plot—
A virgin blossom the day forgot—
A lily swinging restlessly,
With an aching heart for a noon-tide bee.
The other lilies are drunk with spring;
They hear no hoot and they feel no wing;
And sleep is sweet on each sated flower,
But this lily wakes at the midnight hour —
Wakes, when the world is all asleep,
And wakes alone —and so wakes to weep.
She beats her fingers on the sill—
Idle fingers, but never still—
Heavy with gems and the weight of rings,
With a great gold chain at her throat that
swings
An emerald into her bosom’s dip ;
And she lines her brow and she bites her lip,
And she kicks her broidered shoon away
Where the nurse shall find them at break of
day.
But nurse, with her aged, peering eyes
That are never merry but always wise,
Will take the slippers and put them by
And close, the shutter, and grunt and sigh,
The morning draught to her charge to take—
And the sun is up, but Prue does not wake.
For the Little Brown Men were calling her;
And only the grey owl saw her stir,
Onlji the big owl saw her feet,
Like pearls in the moonlight, naked, sweet,
As they made a stair of the ivy’s rope,
Wall and window, and groin and cope.
She could not fall, for the Brown Men knew
The charm of moonrise, and stars and dew!
False love may ride to the palace door,
Sweep his feathered hat to the polished floor,
Repenting, say that his sin has ceased,
And call for Princess and ring and priest,
Not forgetting the dowry that she brings,
For gold has gilding for tarnished things!
"Beep not. at your window, Princess Prue,
For the Little Brown Men have need of
you ;
And the lies of earth are as breaths that pass
m-ii e c l° uc *ed frame of the mirror's glass,
lill the lily hungers no more to see
Returning wings of a faithless bee.”
Now love may carry a golden ring,
The priest give blessing, the good nuns sing;
But out of the web of the world she lies,
And the stars are close to her peaceful eyes,
1 hough the Church may whisper that all
men know,
There are just tivo doors where a maid may
go—
One to the false love, one to the true—
She has found a window to clamper through!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
The Sender of Snakes.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE banks of the reedy, sinuous creek
were bordered here and there by
clumps of coolabahs, in which flocks
of twittering finches hid from the searching
eyes of two great wedge-tailed eaglehawks
soaring in the glaring blue.
As Wadnungadni, of the Arunta tribe, left
one of the clumps he saw a camp at the
western edge of the next and halted. It
was a sleepy day, and he remained watching
the camp for an hour trying to be seen until
at length, amid great, sudden excitement, tw’o
warriors ran towards him, threateningly
until they saw his markings and emu-
feathers. Then they lowered weapons and
rushed to embrace him instead.
Wadnungadni picked up the load from
which he had been resting, and allowed him-
self to be escorted and received enthusi-
astically. After embracing him, headman
Ivarawora inspected his burden, a red cake
of sixty pounds weight. He pressed his
fingers into it, rubbed and lifted it. It wms
certainly a treasure.
“Mar’ndora ! Mar’ndora!” [superlatively
good], he exclaimed. “Karku!” [red ochre]
“Oh, mar’ndora, karku? The Arunta are
rich in great things !”
“The Yantruwunta are strong and power-
ful, and Karawora is poto-pimanto also!”
said Wadnungadni politely.
“This karku! Oh, what karku! The
Yantruwunta have never seen like it!”
“It is for you, O Karawora!”
“Ngadi? For me? Karku! Mar’ndora!
Mar’ndora!” The whole camp was grinning
and proclaiming the superlative goodness of
the ochre.
“Yes, for you! The Arunta know that
Karawora is nguru-nguru !”
Karawora ran with a particle to the creek
and mixed it. It was a brilliant red, spread
easily, and remained bright. lie returned
beaming.
“Whence came it?”
“It comes from two moons beyond Kati-
tunda [Lake Eyre] ! The Arunta went
there for it.”
“Did you fight?”
“Yes. The Mardula were all open eyes.
I was only Uliara one 1 moon before the
Mardula crept on us. They killed many.
Now lam Head of Snakes! lam Wadnun-
gadni!”
“Wadnungadni travels. Why?”
“To bring karku to Karawora.”
“Why?”
“Karawora has a daughter. Yerrabinda
is Karawora’s daughter !”
Yerrabinda, among the women, had been
admiring the manliness and comeliness of
Wadnungadni. Her name from his lips con-
fused her. She flushed, drooped her head,
and folded her arms over her comely breasts,
which were now also hidden under the
cloud of shining raven hair.
“I come for Yerrabinda,” said the stranger.
“Wadnungadni is rich in great things;
he is Head of Snakes; but his wurleys arc
far. What has Wadnungadni in that bag?”
Karawora touched a fur-string bag tied on
the centre of Wadnungadni’s back.
“Pitclieri!”
“Pitched? Pitched is mar’ndora! The
Arunta have pitched! Let me chew
pitched !”
Wadnungadni pulled a piece that he had
been chewing for weeks from his matted hair,
and passed it over. It was rapaciously
bitten into several pieces and chewed by the
warriors. All asked for pitched.
“Pitclieri! Wonderful pitclieri! Where
does Wadnungadni take that bag of
pitclieri ?”
“I seek a wife. The Arunta murdus have
none for me. Karawora has Yerrabinda.
This” —holding out the bag—“is good pit-
ched. Will Karawora take this pitched and
give me Yerrabinda?”
“Yerrabinda will go with Wadnungadni.
Wadnungadni is a warrior. He is Head of
Snakes! He brings wonderful red-ochre and
divine pitclieri.”
Yerrabinda had been expecting old Ngura-
tulu-tulu-ru [Crooked-legs] to ask for her
as soon as lie could find a suitable present
for her father, and the new proposal was a
glorious contrast. The visitor was young,
noble, brave and handsome. She trembled
with sudden love for him, and shuddered
at the thought that Ngura-tulu-tulu-ru might
still get her. It all depended on the next
few minutes.
“Yerrabinda!”
“My father—rich in knowledge of all
things!”
“Wadnungadni is Head of Snakes! He
is a warrior! He brings me wonderful karku
and divine pitclieri! Go with him!”
“Yes, my father!” Just a whisper.
The women became instantly excited, and
demanded that Yerrabinda should undergo
the woman’s initiation. This, including the
rooting out of a tooth, would take several
days, and his desire for her was great. More-
over, he was afraid that Karawora might
change his mind as the novelty of the gifts
wore off.
“Let Yerrabinda come now!” he cried.
“The water dries up quickly ! Let us depart!
Here is more pitcheri for the women!” He
tossed a small cake to the noisiest, clamorer.
“Come, Yerrabinda!”
“Go, Yerrabinda! Wadnungadni is poto-
pirnanto ! He is nguru-nguru ! He is Head
of Snakes!” spake her father.
She tossed her hair back over her shoul-
ders, picked up her digging-stick with her
toes, seized a lighted firestick, and, with
tears welling over from her eyes, followed.
* * * *
It was towards evening when they came
to a small bank of golden sand edging a
silent, shaded elbow of the creek.
“We will sleep here, Yerrabinda.”
“I will make fire and wurley.”
What a shy girl she was! He ran his
fingers through her hair, and buried his face
in it. No Arunta had ever had a wife with
long hair. A tear moistened his shoulder.
“You are crying, Yerrabinda?”
“Yes-no ! I am happy—and—just a little
frightened.”
“Frightened! Why?”
“Yes. Nobody near us ! Nobody sees us !
We are all alone!”
A little later, as they sat with her head
nestled against his shoulder, and her hair
falling deliciously over his back, a wagtail
cheekily chirruped. “Mar’ndora, Yerrabinda !
Mar’ndora, Yerrabinda!” At least, he told
her that Willie was saying this, adding,
“Wagtail wise bird ; he knows many things!”
“I think he says ‘Wadnungadni’s Yerra-
binda! Wadnungadni’s Yerrabinda !’ He is
a clever bird !”
Loitering deliciously along, it was a
month later before they entered Wadnun-
gadni’s territory. His had been an experi-
ence never before enjoyed by an Arunta —
that of obtaining a beautiful maiden bride
all to himself, and having no interference
for a whole moon in their enthralling com-
panionship. To-morrow he would be with
his people, and he had that day pointed out
to her many interesting sacred places con-
nected with them: a lonely rock that had
been an Arunta, but he had shown a woman
a bull-roarer; a well that was the home of
a good spirit who supplied Arunta sons, and
of which she drank deeply; a stricken tree
that was a young warrior, who ate wild-duck
instead of giving them to the old men.
Dwelling on his office as Head of Snakes,
she looked forward with pride to her posi-
tion as his wife. The Snakes would be de-
lighted to have Wadnungadni back again,
and would pay great honor to his wife.
She let her hair fall over his sleeping face
as Wagtail continued chirruping: “Wadnun-
gadni’s Yerrabinda! Wadnungadni’s Yerra-
binda !”
He seemed to be worried in his sleep, and
she murmured: “Arungquiltha is about!
Tell him to go away, Wagtail!”
“It is not Arungquiltha.” He pressed her
to him. “Arungquiltha cannot come near
a wagtail.”
He felt her warm body through her hair
as Wagtail again chirruped: “Mar’ndora.
Yerrabinda! Mar’ndora, Yerrabinda!”
“No!” he roared. “No! No! No!” He
was on his feet, brandishing his spear. “No
Yerrabinda is mine! Mine! Mine! Yerra-
binda is my tippamalku! Yerrabinda will
not be pirrauru!”
“What are you saying, Wadnungadni?”
she asked anxiously.
In his sheer happiness he had not until
this evening given a thought to Yerrabinda’s
life among his own people. The tippa-
malku, or personal wife, of even the mightiest
Arunta had to be the pirrauru, or general

The Bush-Fire
Heroine.
After using Zam-Buk, Florrie Hodges
says: “I can now go to sleep
without pain.”
The great Victorian bush fires of last summer will
long be remembered, and the name of Florrie Hodges
will live in Australian history for her self-sacrificing
heroism in protecting her three younger sisters with
her own body for hours. The gallant girl s back and
arms were seriously burned by the falling of burning
branches, and the pain she endured was very severe.
In recognition of her brave deed the school children
of Victoria and Western Australia have contributed
generously to a testimonial fund on her behalf. The
New South Wales children are now showing their
appreciation in a similar way.
Writing to the proprietors of Zam-Buk, whilst in
Sydney, Mr. Charles Barrett says:
“As secretary of the Florrie Hodges Testimonial Fund, I have
naturally seen a great deal of her since the tragic fire of February
last. Although Florrie has made a wonderful recovery, she is not
free from pain and irritation, and, in an attempt to relieve her, a
few weeks ago I supplied her with some Zam-Buk. J emptied the
contents of the tins into a plain jar, as I wanted to know exactly
how much good, your preparation would do her without her knowing
what it was. In a letter I have just received from Florrie she says:
“ ‘You asked me to let you know how I got on with the oint-
ment you gave me in a plain jar.
“ ‘For nearly four weeks I have ruhhcd the ointment into my
leg and arm twice a day as you told me to do.
“ ‘The burning hot feeling in my leg is almost gone, and the sores
on my arm are much better. I can now go to sleep without pain. I
don’t, know the name of the ointment, but you can tell the people who
make it that it is the best stuff I have used since I was burnt in the
big fire last February. „ (Signed) FLORRIE HODGES.’
“I gladly give you permission to publish this statement if you
so desire
This valued testimony demonstrates once again the
efficacy of Zam-Buk. For more than a quarter of a
century it has stood the test as a reliable healer and
antiseptic for all kinds of skin injuries. Whatever your
skin trouble —try Zam-Buk first! Get the remedy that
has been proved in thousands of cases.

“A Surgery in a 2-inch Box.”
wife, of his tribal brethren, some of whom
were older than his father. Such was the
Arunta custom, and so unquestioned had it
ever been that, had he got his wife from
that or a neighboring nation, no thought of
an objection would ever have entered his
mind. It was this heavenly month alone
with Yerrabinda that caused Wadnungadni
to be the first Arunta to become lovingly and
jealously determined that ins wife would
never, never be pirrauru. It was too ter-
rible to think of anyone touching that hair,
let alone possessing his treasured Yerrabinda.
had not Wagtail called her “Wadnungadni s
Yerrabinda”? Not Mandra-pirnani’s or
Bebejern’s Yerrabinda ! Nor anyone ilse s -
No! No! and no, over and over again.
And the women would certainly hack that
hair off, for no Arunta woman was allowed
to keep long hair, it being continually cut
to be made into string.
He saw her eyes even in the _ starlight,
shining like those other Centralian stars,
and he decided to turn back and to become
an exile from his own people. When one
has the woman of one’s choice, what more
can- life offer ?
Morn found them again facing the rising
sun. It also, however silhouetted a party
of natives on the crest of a sandhill.
“Arunta!” he groaned: and he saw that
he and the woman had also been seen.
“What are they doing?” she asked.
“They are dancing for some reason —I
know not why. They are singing, too.’
They were, indeed, a happy party who had
set out two days before to welcome their
Head of Snakes, in a manner worthy of
such a Head. “Snakes! Big snakes! Fat
snakes! Mar’ndora snakes! Snakes every-
where! Mar’ndora, Wadnungadni! Plenty
snakes!” they yelled. “Our Head of Snakes
is wise. He is poto-pirnanto! He is nguru-
nguru! Never before have the Arunta had
so many snakes.”
Wadnungadni took her hand as the yelling
dancers commenced encircling them. lie
was thinking deeply. In the midst of the
noise he pressed her hand and smiled at
her.' and she felt safe even among a party
that! Contained several of her husband’s tribal
brethren.
Eat big snake, Wadnungadni! •
Bellyful of snake, Wadnungadni!
Everyday plenty snake, Wadnungadni!
They left off yelling and dancing only
when utterly exhausted.
The early summer had, for some reason,
brought an unprecedented supply of snakes,
and, as Head of Snakes, and thus respon-
sible, Wadnungadni was credited with the
performance.
‘“yhe Arunta will not be hungry for many
months,” he called out. “You may eat
snakes ! All Arunta may eat snakes !”
Another tumult broke forth, for now those
who had been enviously watching the few
enjoying snake-dinners could themselves eat,
for permission had been given by the only
one who could give it.
When they were silent again Wadnun-
gandi raised his spear. The announcement
was to be an important one.
“My tippamalku lias helped me to send
the snakes! Yerrabinda is not to be pir-
rauru ! Her hair is not to be string! If she
be pirrauru or her hair made string the
snakes will leave the Arunta for ever. Now
all may eat snake !”
That evening the pair were escorted into
camp by a crowd yelling: “Wadnungadni is
great and wise and good! The Plead of
Snakes is poto-pirnanto! All may now fill
the belly with snakes !”
THOMAS A WHITE.
The Generosity of Sparkle.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
two anglers disconsolately set about
I stowing away their gear. With some-
thing between a sigh and a malediction
they turned their backs upon the stream
they had reached with such high hopes a
few hours previously, mounted their horses
and set off through the bush in the direction
of home.
“Our luck’s been out to-day, all right,”
ventured the younger man after they had
proceeded some distance in silence.
“Luck's had nothing to do with it!”
snapped Sparkle testily. “I’ll tell you what
it is: the rivers about here are just fished
out, and mostly by those poaching skunks
who won’t pay a license. Pity we can’t drop
on one or two of them —I’d haul ’em before
the Bench in double-quick time.”
In the early part of the season Sparkle
had taken out a fishing license, but this
was the first time he had been privileged
to indulge in his favorite pastime, and now
the season was drawing to a close. Naturally
he felt sore against the Government over it.
“Yes,” he went on, “it’s these no-license
skunks we’ve got to thank for it all. They’ve
fished the rivers dry. There’s that Boggins
fellow, for instance. He never took out a
license in his life, yet everybody knows he
puts in all his spare time at the game. If
the water-bailiff was not such an ass he’d
have bagged him long ago. Why, now, if
I was water-bailiff, I’d” ——
Sparkle stopped short. Emerging from the
scrub a short distance ahead was the very
gentleman he had been discussing—Boggins.
In liis hand he carried a rod done up in a
dapper canvas cover, and slung over his back
was a fishing-basket that, by the way it
hung, was certainly stuffed with something
more substantial than grass.
I He was making off again in the scrub
\yhen he heard the two behind him. With
A yell Sparkle bore down on him like a loco-
motive running amok, and cut off his retreat.
1 “Haigli, you!” he roared as he came up—
“where’s your license?”
Boggins went through a dumb show of
feeling in all his pockets. “Why, now, really,
Mr. Sparkle, I think I—I —must have lost
it,” he stammered.
“You never had one, you mean!” said
Sparkle, leaning over in the saddle until he
was a few inches from the other’s face. “And
it’s for the thieving of you that I and
my friend Swash here, who pay our licenses,
keep the rivers running and stocked with
trout. You're coming right along with us
now to the police-station, rod and basket and
all. It’s just the chance we’ve been waiting
for and”-
Suddenly Boggins, who was facing the way
the two had come, stared past and beyond
them; and a new fear came into his eyes.
Turning and following the gaze, Sparkle saw
the water-bailiff himself approaching.
“Ali!” cried Sparkle gleefully, turning
again to Boggins, “it could hardly have been
better. His reverence will now catch you
red-handed in the presence of witnesses,
and”
The words trailed away into nothingness;
and, looking at his friend, Swash was sur-
prised to see the anger slowly leave his face
and a look of benevolence come there instead.
Boggins also noticed it, and smiled at Sparkle
in a sickly way.
“After all, my friend,” said Sparkle, turn-
ing again to Boggins, “why should we be
enemies? We’re only in the world for a
short time —here to-day, gone to-morrow.
Therefore let us bury the hatchet. Slip your
basket off and put your rod with it, and 1 11
pass ’em off as mine. I’ve got a license, so
1 don’t care a snap for old Copper yonder.
Boggins quickly complied, and was in the
act of murmuring his thanks and telling
Sparkle that he had always known him to
be one of Nature’s gentlemen, when the
bailiff arrived. Without a word he went
straight to the basket and tipped out four
fine rainbow trout.
“Whose are these?” lie asked sharply,
looking with a kind of gloat in his eyes at
Boggins.
“Mr. Sparkle’s,” answered Boggins quickly.
“An’ the rod an’ tackle?”
“Mr. Sparkle’s.”
The bailiff’s jaw fell. For months past
he had been shadowing Boggins, knowing
him to be fishing without a license, but lnu.
never been able to sheet the charge home.
His paean of victory was changed to a dirge
of defeat. But he turned to Sparkle.
“Come, now, are they yours —really, Mr.
Sparkle?” he asked coaxingly. .
Swash had grave fears for his friend s
welfare at that moment. He swallowed hard
as he turned savagely on the bailiff.
“Of course, they’re mine,” he said. Didn t
my friend Mr. Boggins just tell you so !
A pretty kind of water-bailiff you are when
you won’t take the word of a gentleman .
Boggins grinned his thanks at Sparkle.
The bailiff was about to move dolefully
off when Sparkle called to him: “Hang on
a bit, bailiff,” he said. “Although, naturally,
you have offended me by doubting the word
of my friend, I am not forgetting that you
officials have a duty to perform. To show
that I bear you no ill-will, will you accept
a trout for the wife’s and the little bailiffs
tea?” , . . ...
“Thanks, Mr. Sparkle; I don t mind it
I do.” . .
Sparkle turned to Boggins. Just pick
out the biggest of my trout and hand it to
the bailiff Avith my compliments, please, Mr.
Boggins,” he said sweetly.
The smile left Boggins’s face as he slowly
complied.
“I suppose, Bailiff,” went on Sparkle,
“that you often make merry over a dish of
trout?” ,
“No, Mr. Sparkle. You see, I m kep so
busy trying to prevent those who shouldn t
have ’em from taking ’em that I’ve little time
left for fishing meself.”
“Is that so, Bailiff? I feel ashamed
at offering you only one trout. Take two.
Give our friend the next biggest, Mr. Bog-
gins.”
With a scowl on his face, Boggins did as
he was commanded.
“How many little Bailiffs call you dad f
asked Sparkle as the man was moving off
at, “Let me see, now,” replied the bailiff.
“There’s Gideon, an Allaweesha, an’ Didy-
mus, an’ Dorcas, an’ Dunstan, an’ Wilber-
force, an’ Joan, an’ Florentine, besides Glad-
stone the baby. That makes nine so far.”
Sparkle looked at the man a moment in
horrified silence.
“What!” he cried. “Nine of ’em? That
means eleven mouths to feed altogether. And
here I go and offer you two paltry fish to
help you solve the problem! Take the lot,
Bailiff, and welcome,” he added in a sudden
burst of generosity. He turned to the illegal
owner of the fish. “Hand them over, Bog-
gins, and don’t stand looking as if you’d
seen your grandfather’s ghost.”
Muttering beneath his breath, and looking
long-toms and poison-gas at Sparkle, Bog-
gins passed over the remaining fish.
Probably by this time the bailiff had begun
to catch the drift of things; but he didn’t
let on. He thanked Sparkle profusely, and
was on the point of moving off again when
once more his benefactor stopped him.
“Hold on a minute. What do you own
in the way of fishing-tackle?”
“I’ve got one rod an’ ”
“What!” interrupted Sparkle. “One rod
to-keep eleven stomachs filled? And here’s
me now, with only myself to look after and
two rods —the one I’m holding and the one
on the grass there! No wonder there’s
socialists and reA'olutionists in the world
while such an unfair distribution of the good
things of life exists. Take one, man—the
best one—and a thousand welcomes with it.
Bass it along to our friend the bailiff, Bog-
gins, like a good chap.”
Boggins tried to speak, but he couldn’t.
He just stood and seemed to swell to double
his ordinary size with rage.
“Are you altogether daft, Boggins?” said
Sparkle, tired of waiting. “Or is it that you
are only more than ordinarily stupid this
day? Whose rod is it, anyhow?” he asked.
“Will you tell the bailiff yourself, or must
I?”
“It’s yours, I s’pose,” snapped Boggins.
“Very well, then. I can do as I like with
my own, so hand it over to our friend the
bailiff—with the basket for him to carry
the fish in!”
With a burst of language that would not
bear repeating, Boggins savagely threw the
rod in its dandy canvas cover, followed by
the basket, at the water-bailiff’s feet. Then,
kicking the tussocks like a mother’s- spoilt
darling, he turned and hurried away along
the bush track.

The.
MOTOR MOWER
AT SPECIAL CUT PRICES FOR THE
1926 SEASON.
The “ATCO” will make a very strong appeal to those faced with the neces-
sity of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.e., secretaries of cricket, golf, lawn
tennis, and bowling clubs, proprietors of estates of an acre or more, members of
park committees, hotelkeepers, &c.
It is fitted with a 22-h.p. engine, which develops more than sufficient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one at-
tendant for guiding purposes.
The running cost of an “ACTO,” thanks to the scientific precision of its con-
struction, is remarkably low. An operator can very easily and completely cut
1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol and
oil mixture.
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine.
With the object of making this ALL-BRITISH MOWER more popular on
the Australian market, we are offering them for season 1926 at specially reduced
prices. Full stocks on hand, .
PRICES:-—Min, cutters, £47/10/; 16in., £57/10/; 22m., £B2/10/; 30m.,
