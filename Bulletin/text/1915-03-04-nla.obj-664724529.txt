The Austral Year
A SECOND SELECTION OF “RED
PAGE” SONNETS.
JANUARY.
Proud Summer stood, a dice-box in her hand,
But yestere’en beneath the moon’s pale glow,
Whilst we, impatient, waited for the throw
That should decide the fortunes of our band.
Then straightforth she, the gambler, reckless,
grand, .
Cast out the Dice upon the Plains of Woe,
And, as we watched, amid vague whisp’rings
low,
Behold! A new year broke upon the land.
And, when, amid the dried grass ichere it
feU,
We saw the six-spot upmost on the Dice,
All knew that Summer’s toll would not yet
end;
But that, relentless, she would wring her
price
From sun-dried crops, till weary men should
bend
And pay full tribute to this Bride of Hell.
HEEBEBT TBACEY.
FEBRUARY.
The quivering plains lie breathless in the
glow
Of noontide’s keen, intolerable gold;
The glittering seas with warm, white arms
enfold
A slumb’rous land; from cloudy ranges flow
Faint, aromatic smoke-wreaths, soft and
slow,
In filmy wefts of fantasy unrolled
To mask the day, and through the night to
hold
A sorcerer’s moon, ensanguined, large and low.
The rich quintessence of a Summertide,
All passionately quickened with the pain
Of Time’s irrevocable mandate, lies
In February’s lap; yet drowsy eyed
She dreams of chill winds whistling, flecked
with rain,
’Neath skies o’ercast, and, dreaming, softly
sighs.
SYD.C
MARCH.
Tarnished, the first rich emerald of the year,
But gaudier blossoms than the Spring can
show
Make bright the borders, while the orchards
glow
With wealth of hue in many a ruddy sphere,
The world keeps silence, lest it fail to hear
The long-drawn sigh that stirs the sentinel
row
Of poplar trees, when, wistfully and slow,
Their first leaf falling tells the end is near.
Dreams sweep the heart, like shadowy clouds
at noon
That float across a field of ripened grain —
Such dreams as come to him who, lonely,
sees
The beneficent rising of the harvest moon,
And hears the undercurrent of earth’s pain
In the hushed whispers of the waiting trees.
HELEN POWEB.
APRIL.
Carols the magpie, “Lo, again ’tis Spring!”
For tipped with green is each pittosporum
tree,
And, on the heath, boronias pink with glee
Laugh to the sun, and on the breezes fling
Their pungent scent. A swift kingfisher's
wing
Is not more purple-green that gleams the
sea,
Yet, like a sad word dropped unwittingly,
The wind blows keenly with a sudden sting.
The year’s decline with you has had no part,
O autumn April with the vernal face,
Is it a compact you have made with Time,
Or haply did you steal the golden heart
Of some great woman, so with mellow grace
The year might slip unnoticed past her
prime?
NINA MURDOCH.
MAY.
The autur n sunsets paint the aureate West
With all the perfect purples of the year.
True to his tryst, behold! the wheat is here
And throws his decent veil o’er Earth’s bare
breast.
Like heretics in sanbenitos dressed
The flame-trees in their scarlet cloaks appear,
And nature, with a sudden gusty tear,
Is faiin, a weary child, for Winter’s rest.
May is come —she walks the misty ways
"Ad greets the lilac orchid's bowing buds
pith little lilting laughs of sunshine, cross’d
With sighs. Her night-robes gleam with
starry studs.
Of glist’ning steel, and all her hearth-fires
blaze
Defiance to the clutching clarcs of Frost!
S. ELLIOTT NAPIER.
JUNE.
The furrowed lands shine emerald again,
Winter and dearth for glorious growth make
way,
Where wheat plants wave their spears in
bold array
The bushland trees reflect the vivid stain
Where mournful curlew choirs at night com-
plain,
And meditative ibis pose by day,
The creek runs singing on its rock-strewn
way,
Filled overfull by warm, monsoonal rain.
Across the flat the bounteous flow spreads
wide,
Quenching the fire of crimson water weeds;
Its sinuous waves ’twixt gum trunks softly
glide,
Brim the lagoon and overwhelm the reeds
While Spring’s bright wattle buds above the
tide
Are dancing in a million golden beads.
“AENEAS HAYSEED.”
JULY.
By fragrant tokens on the wintry way
I know she has been here, timid and fleet,
Too frail to linger yet and boldly meet
Rough Winter’s jealous wrath. Saw you
her, pray?
A primrose wreath upon her brow, and gay
Red wind-flowers at her breast, all dewy-
sweet?
Heard you the tread of light, wind-driven
feet?
Did such a maid delight your eyes to-day?
Ay! on the highway in the windy morn
We saw her pass, in gown of green arrayed,
With tossing hair and sheaves of dafiodils;
But as we spied her Winter’s clam’rous horn
Mustered the storm-clouds. Suddenly dis-
mayed,
She fled. The grey rain hid the misty hills.
LILLA GORMIIUILLE McKAY.
AUGUST.
The spendthrift wattles wave each yellow
tress,
And lavish largesse on the wanton bees, ,
Who, golden-thighed with all their fragrant
fees,
Yield to the nectar’d blooms their bold caress.
The mating birds, decked in their nuptial
dress,
Keep tryst amid the secret, shady trees,
And upward to the light and to the breeze
The green-lanced armies of the wheatfield
press. ■ -
For this is now the August fairies’ hour,
When stooping o’er her cradle, one by one,
They on the new-born Spring their gifts
bestow;
The gift of bursting shoot and budding
flow’r;
The gift of humid rain and gracious sun;
The golden gift of youth and all its glow!
S. ELLIOTT NAPIEB.
SEPTEMBER.
When bright September breaks the winter
hush
That stilled the noisy bushland’s merry
tongue,
From red-tipped eucalyptus scrub, o’erhung
With braids of purple creeper, wanton, lush,
That hide the greens and yellows in a crush
Of richer color, joyfully is flung
The softest note in all the springtime sung —
The sweet low whistle of a mating thrush.
Quick to the call the waking bush world
thrills
With life anew, while light and shade and
song
Sway changefully like gaily-colored flocks
Of wheeling parrots in the lower hills,
That, screaming, give strange echo to the
long,
Loud music of the boisterous Equinox.
DUNCAN BEOWN.
OCTOBER.
Priestess of flow’rs• —her acolytes the bees —
She comes, sun-kissed anon, now chastely
cold;
Grey-garbed she weeps or sings in shining
gold,
October, Mistress of Caprice! The seas
Begin for her their siren song; the trees
Full-freighted with shy, nestling birds, unfold
Their new green cloaks and all the flowers
hold
The fragrance of her rare and rain-washed
breeze.
Sweet, wilful maiden-month of fronding fern,
Here is the ever-changeless charm of change:
Before her waits and waves the whisp’ring
wheat;
To her the waratahs ’ red altars burn;
The wattle dies for her along the range
And casts his golden glories at her feet!
S. ELLIOTT NAPIER
NOVEMBER.
Deflowered Spring lies haggard to the sky,
Dead and despoiled, her golden tresses shorn
To make a tasselled trophy for the corn;
Her cheek’s fair flush, the azure of her eye
Purloined to paint the rank convolvuli;
The locust-sycophants, with strident scorn,
Now mock at her who freed them yestermorn
And hail November, come to see her die.
November, glowing in her glad attire,
Young Summer’s mistress, with love-loosened
hair,
Shows no soft shyness; her assertive charms
Sh& proffers freely to her lover’s fire:
Drunken with youth and warm with per-
fumed air
She yields herself and wantons in his arms.
S. ELLIOTT NAPIER.
DECEMBER.
A splendid maid, bareheaded in the light,
Whose warm, brown skin and hot, imperious
ways
Hold men enthralled and listless with amaze
To find such undimmed beauty in their sight!
But thrice seductive is she when at night
She flings aside the noontide’s shimmering
haze •
And show’rs her scented tresses, all ablaze
With starry gems, down from the purple
height.
And now we see her wading through the l
creek;
Now on the beaches gleaming in the curl
Of half-turned breakers; now with burnished
feet
Spurning the plains;—and yet we need but
seek
In scrub and gully for this radiant girl
To find her drowsing, exquisitely sweet!
NINA MURDOCH.
Winter Dread
“John Drayman”: “S.T.S.” (“Bed Page,”
21/1/T5) attributes the curious dread of
winter voiced by the year’s prize sonneteers
to “an inheritance from British Writers.”
Question. At least, it seems doubtful if any
of our real Australian poets have inherited
apy distinctly British possession barring the
language. To be sure we have a numerous
and not wholly valueless class of versifiers
whose work, in phrase and sentiment, is
full of British echoes ; but few of this class
secured a high place in the monthly sonnet
competition. (Even “Bellerive,” who almost
attains to a class of his own, appears, on
analysis, to belong to the great British
echoers; for surely his best lines have the
direct thrust of Marston Moor and Hastings,
and the incisive simplicity of John Bun-
yan.) One fancies the explanation of the
Winter Dread of our best poets lies right at
our own back door. While there is no winter
to be dreaded at Wagga or Thargomindah
or Booligal or Kalgoorlie, the dread is very
real in South Gippsland, Maoriland and
Tasmania. Improved economic conditions
have modified the dread of late years, especi-
ally in the two first-named wet spots, but
no Australian poet of either sex can fail to
sense the keen Winter Dread of even the
present generation of Tasmanians. If main-
land poets don’t all happen to visit Tas-
mania and come into direct contact with
the dread expressed by all classes in the
Apple Speck, they cannot fail to collect the
impression from ex-Tasmanian neighbors,
many of whom, years after settling on the
mainland, still retain the habit of thinking
and speaking of the winter as a cold, wet,
dreary and essentially hard-time season
against which it is necessary to make timely
and special provision. It is the absence of
their native, Winter Dread that makes the
mainland so attractive to Tasmanian toilers
that they seldom return to the Island once
they get away from it. Inland Australians
(apart from the highly impressionable poets,
of course) cannot understand the strength of
this feeling. One remembei’s seeing a whole
hut-full of shearers smile scoffingly at the
joyful surprise expx*essed by a new-chum
from Tassie when he learnt for the first time
that he could get a nine-months’ job of tank-
sinking on the station directly after shear-
ing if he so desired. The youth’s enthusiasm
to sign on foi’i a steady job “to see him
through the winter” astonished the others.
Nothing short of downright stone, mother-
less brokiness would entice them back to a
Hungerford squattery after shearings—not
before the next lamb-marking, anyway.
■J*
That miasma upon our poetry, the Great
Australian Winter Dread, is not so apparent
in the secoqd selection of sonnets upon our
months here reprinted. These comprise the
runners-up in our monthly sonnet competi-
tion. Taking, roughly, for summer months,
November, December, January and February,
we find that in November “deflowered Sprang
lies haggard to the sky, dead and despoiled” ;
January is a “bride of Hell,” and February
“dreams of chill winds whistling flecked with
rain.” Not much Winter Dread here ; but
December is “a splendid maid... .exquisitely
sweet.” Taking as approximately winter
months, May, June, July and August, we
note, howevei’, that the Winter Dread is
upon the winter poet. May’s “hearthfires
blaze defiance to the clutching claws of
frost”; in June winter is a synonym for
“dearth”; July remembers “rough winter’s
jealous wrath” ; but August is glad of “the
gift of gracious sun.” The intervening
months, March and April, herald the
approach of the Dread. March “hears the
undercurrent of earth’s pain,” and April’s
wind has “a sudden sting.” September and
October implicitedly rejoice that winter is
over, though every poet is expected, to be
glad that life is awakening in spring and
that the world is full of blossom and the beer
is on the ice. Evidently the Winter Dread
is one of the inherent qualities of our poetry,
though the disease makes itself felt only
during winter time.. In summer our per-
spiring poets are afflicted with the Summer
Dread.
The Amazing Anatole
What can one say of Anatole France, the
author of The Revolt of the Angels (Lane,
per Dymock’s Library) ? He is so fimazingly
erudite, so naively naughty, so brilliantly
bookish, so brazenly blasphemous. His latest
novel has for theme nothing less than the
second attempt of Lucifer to overthrow
God. A theme not unworthy of Milton, who
took the whole affair rather too ponderously,
but surely not the fit subject for Anatole
France? For he sets his scene in Paris,
which, as everybody knows, is thronged with
angels. Maurice’s guardian angel chooses a
most inconvenient moment to appear in
human form to Maurice and Madame
des Aubels. He is already a dis-
illusionised angel, having read all the
books of theology and science in a
great private library, and intent only on
organising the great rebellion against God.
For knowledge has changed him: he has lost
his faith. He wanders, in human form, about
Paris, instigating his fellow angels to the
great rebellion, while Maurice, feeling
vaguely ill at ease without his guardian
angel, seeks him, and even advertises for him
in the daily paper. Arcade, his guardian
angel, having taken human form —and feel-
ings—meantime comports himself in a way
that, but for Anatole France’s assurance —
and he is an expert in the manners and cus-
toms of angels—we should not have believed
possible. And he finds other angels in the
most curious of human disguises—one is com-
posing a comic opera and keeps his wings in
a cupboard of his attic, where the moths
get at them. Another has assumed the dis-
guise of a beautiful girl.
Maurice finds his guardian angel again,
and has a duel with him over the usual lady.
But the author is more interested in the
conspiracy of the anarchistic angels. He
admits us to the secret meetings of the
Fallen Angels’ Anarchist Society, and re-
counts, with gusto, the encounter of the
angels with the Parisian police. We are also
given what may be called a special war-
correspondent’s account of the first revolt
of Lucifer. The whole campaign is bril-
liantly described by an angel who was at
the front. And after the defeat of Lucifer’s
host the Seraph, erect in Hell, addressed his
defeated army. “Here we are free, and it
were better to be free in Hell than serve in
Heaven. We are not conquered, since the
will to conquer is still 0ur5....1f victory is
denied us now, it is because we are neither
worthy nor capable of victory. Let us deter-
mine wherein we have failed. Nature shall
not be ruled, the sceptre of the Universe
shall not be grasped, Godhead shall not be
won, save by knowledge a10ne.... It is
through pain that, suffering a first experience
of Nature, we have been roused to know her
and to subdue her.”
Meantime the Earth was coming into
being, and in man Lucifer found the instru-
ment for his great revenge. Lucifer taught
man knowledge and rebellion, till the time
came for the final revolt. In a dream, how-
ever, Satan is allowed to foresee the conse-
quences of his victory. Lucifer dreamed
that his new engines and machines had over-
thrown the comparatively untrained and
amateur army of the Heavenly host, that he
had hurled God into Hell, and reigned as the
Supreme Being himself in Heaven.
“Thus centuries passed like seconds. Now,
one day, from the altitude of his throne, he
plunged his gaze into the depths of the pit
and saw God in the Gehenna where he him-
self had long lain enchained. Amid the
everlasting g100m.... blackened and shat-
tered, terrible and sublime, he glanced up-
wards at the palace of the King of Heaven
with a look of proud disdain. And the new
god, as he looked upon his foe, beheld the
light of intelligence and love pass across his
sorrow-stricken countenance. And lo! God
was now contemplating the; Earth, and, see-
ing it sunk in wickedness and suffering....
on a sudden rose up, and beating the ether
with his mighty arms, as though with oars,
he hastened thither to instruct and console
mankind.
“Satan woke, bathed in an icy sweat.
‘Comrades,’ he said, ‘we will not conquer the
heavens. Enough to have the power. War
engenders war, and victory defeat. God,
conquered, will become Satan; Satan, con-
quering, will become god. May the fates
spare me this terrible lot; I love the Hell
which formed my genius.... As to ourselves,
celestial spirits, sublime demons, we have
destroyed God, our Tyrant, if in ourselves
we have destroyed Ignorance and Fear.’ '•
A sublime ending to an extraordinary
book. The discreet reader will see in this
work nothing but an elaborate allegory,
brought down to earth by the familiar treat-
ment and the delicate Gallic touch of this
talented, cynical writer. But one wonders
how Anatole learnt so much of the habits of
guardian angels.
Apparently unaware that the Balkan wars
were so soon to be forgotten in the present
world horror, the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, Washington, D.C., for-
ward the comprehensive Report of the Inter-
national Commission which inquired into
the conduct and causes pf the two Balkan
wars. It is full of “atrocities” that were at
that time justly regarded as atrocious; but
subsequent events have proved that when
the Prussian runs amok he can leave the
gentle Bulgarian at the starting post. The
photographs published by this commission
are frankly horrible—but not so horrible as
the war photographs that are being.pub-
lished now.
One did not expect so capable a journalist
as Ambrose Pratt to let slip so large and so
obvious an opportunity as the present war.
War in the Pacific (Critchley Parker, Melb.;
Is. 6d.) is founded on the recent German
naval activity in our waters. His hero is an
Englishman living in Samoa who marries a
half-caste Samoan, who admits that he “is
not the first.” They, with other Australians
and Englishmen, are taken prisoners by a
converted German merchantman, conveyed
to the German secret fortified port in the
Pacific, and have innumerable adventures
thereafter. The prisoners are brutally
treated by their captors, the girl suffering
the common fate of the girls of Belgium; but
the hero is an Ambrose Pratt hero. He
poisons a whole ship’s company of the vessel
on which he. is employed, does it methodically
and in a delightfully wholesale manner. Then
he and his wife and fellow-prisoners escape
beneath the shells of the Germans. But
what was left of his wife was hardly worth
saving. “The Germans made sure of that.”
Brisk and topical.

Rifle And Pistol Cartridges
When you buy rifle and pistol cartridges you want
them to be sure-fire and accurate, and to have the
proper speed and penetration —qualities which are all
essential for good shooting. There is nothing in the
appearance of a cartridge that indicates whether
it does or does not possess these qualities, for the
elements that make them cannot be seen. Therefore
when buying you have to rely upon reputation.
Winchester Rifle and Pistol Cartridges enjoy the
highest reputation the world over for quality and
reliability. When you buy, if you will insist upon hav-
ing Winchester make you can feel confident of getting
cartridges which are sure to give the fullest measure of
shooting satisfaction. Look for the Won the box. It is

THIN WOMEN !
Would You
Like a Well Developed
and Well Proportioned
FIGURE?
ANY WOMAN without full bust development lacks the one essential
that creates a perfect appearance. Lack of proper bust development, hollow
cheeks and “salt-cellars” quickly take from a woman the bloom and fresh-
ness of healthy womanhood. Misfortune may have been your lot in so far
as natural development is concerned, but science has found a way to correct
your deficiency. Even though you have never been full-bosomed, and have
been attenuated all your life, if you suffer from no wasting disease, your
bosom can be fully developed and your weight increased to normal....
_ There are to-day hundreds of women who were once thin, flat-bosomed,
hollow-cheeked and generally scraggly in appearance, and suffering the effects of
anaemia and defective digestion, who are now for the first time, in their lives
healthy, full-bosomed and pink-cheeked, and enjoying the full vigor of robust
womanhood, as the result of a few weeks under our wonderful
DR. FALLIERE’S FLESH-FOOD. .
Flesh-Food is totally harmless in every respect. Its efficacy is beyond question, and its use is
no demand upon the subject’s time. Many cases have gained up to six pounds a week, and an
increase in bust measurement up to eight or ten inches is possible. Flesh-Food offers relief
and development to the thousands of chronically thin women who have despaired of ever possessing
a presentable figure. It is a nerve and tissue food-treatment that adds weight and permanent
development to attenuated women. Guarantee given in every case accepted.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Wind of Unrest.
A voice goes out iij. every wind,
A ghostly voice by land and sea,
Saying, “Leave all that lies behind;
Fare forth, and follow me!”
The deep-sea trawler knows the call;
The fisher in the land-locked bay ;
The drover hears it, piping small,
Responds, and hies away.
Down in the maze of shafts and drives
The miner hears it, breathing low,
A tale of stranger ways and lives,
And waits his chance to go.
It whispers to the city clerk ;
It calls the tradesman from his ware,
The smith from clanging workshops dark,
The lawyer from his lair.
To worthy soul or feckless scamp,
Regardless each of his degree,
The message blows through field and camp,
“Fare forth, and follow me!”
The call is to be up and strong,
Potential in the world’s affairs ;
On active venture hurled along
With all that fights and dares;
To swing into the nation’s stride,
To balk its rivals and its foes,
And join in that resistless tide
That rolls where no man knows.
VICTORIA.
C. G. A. COLLES.
Morning Travel.
Aloof the morning rose with darkling front,
Frosting a sober nothingness and pale.
The little stars blinked once and seemed
to sail
Through the ethereal void; while, grunt on
grunt,
Like some divided purpose in slow pain,
Coaled with the dust of ages burning stale,
Outresting slumber sagged the veering train.
It veered, it vore, and at my fretful heart
The cankerous grey chimneys flung the gage
Of some preposterous battle faith might
wage,
Tearing a thousand wealthless doors apart,
To win one truth from the departed Nine
That with their names Greek-written on the
page
Of errant truth dissolve the soul in wine.
Wine there was none. The ham was over-
cut.
My hot mouth grated on the tea’s harsh
edge,
And fitful spokes of butter, like a wedge
Of purposeless emotion in the rut
Of rumbling fiction, made their hungry call
To toast that was not. Slowly the long
sedge
Of rusted whiskers near me rose to fall.
Clamorous as tin, at last, at last it came,
Grinding the air to sin beneath its wheels,
Spluttering its corn of hearts and horns and
heels,
A winding worm made ticket-thrall to
shame.
The sun uprose, the barring signal fell,
The world unfrighted by its triple squeals
Blushed, dimpled, and the station passed
in smell.

Greetings.
If there should come to you. blown down the
wind
(Above the smoke and soot and stealthy
cats
That ramble inwards on the dingy roofs ;
High-pitched child voices in obscure back-
yards
And all this chorus of unlovely things)
A breath of roses, as though Eastern jars
Had slipped their lashings on the donkeys’
back,
Met a sly kick in falling, or crashed hard
Against the stained steps of an ancient
mosque ;
While filthy beggars whined and sniffed and
scraped
About the wreckage, wondering if it held
Amid the shattered dragons of the delf
A sugared sweetmeat rolled in cinnamon,
Cursing the small white donkey when they
found
Only the rose leaves of a summer dead —
If this scent comes to you o’er chimney pots,
Blown weather cocks and half a million tiles,
To tell of sleepy, dew-bathed carmine buds
Or big, round yellow blooms, with petals
proud
For just one day, Night finding them grass-
strewn.
Oh, you will know ’twas I who laced the
wind
With an old dream of roses that we knew!
And if at evening when the emerald stars
Have made a jewel-mine of sea and sky, •
And you shall stir to the forgotten touch
Of that fond hand that used to curl in yours
And hate to leave the man-grip of your palm,
Then if your fingers seem to close in sleep
About the ringless hand that loved too well,
It is my phantom, passing through the air.
Ghost fingers that are lonelier than yours !
If at the dawn you wake to muffled cries,
Hoarse chantings of the street, and loud
newsboys
Who seem to think that Crime was made for
this,
Murder and suicide and bloodv war
Especially designed for special sales,
And raucous milkmen and insistent wheels,
And all things city-smirched and foul and
grey,
No welcoming leaves a-peep o’er window sills
And the sun worship of awakening trees—
If there comes humming, like a harp in
boughs,
Soft waves on pebbly beaches, or a breath
Ringing the golden bells of mountain flowers,
Know it is I, whose heart keeps music still
Among the broken strings you used to play!

A HYMN OF HATE INSTEAD OF A
TARIFF.
As was of course inevitable, loud, deafening
noises have commenced to reverberate
through Australian cities concerning the
great wisdom of at once cutting the trade
painter with Germany, finally and for ever
more. It is an easy thing to talk about at
this stage. German trade with Australia
being now not worth a ’possum skin, and
there being most excellent opportunities for
establishing business relations with the
clientele of a once-flourishing but now mori-
bund Teuton commerce, what more appro-
priate than that indent agents, importers,
merchants of every kind —who quite recently
dealt as much as they could with the Ger-
man—and politicians should meet together
to eat “patriotic” luncheons and unanimously
damn the thing already dead?
* * -X- *
For over a generation past the doctrine of
promoting local manufactures so that the
people of Australia might be independent of
the foreigner, has been viciously combated
as a dangerous heresy by a more or less
powerful section of politicians and by the
bulk of the commercial community. Though
the people have over and over again pro-
nounced in favor of Australian manufactures,
and given the Legislature most emphatic
mandates to encourage them, so bitter has
been the opposition, so hesitating and inade-
quate the work of successive Parliaments,
that imports have gone on growing, and Aus-
tralia has in each succeeding year entertained
more hospitably a ravening army of bagmen
and drummers from over-sea. Against every
remonstrance that the nation was by this
demented conduct weakening its resources
and heavily discounting the future, the weary,
doddering old cry was raised that exchange of
goods was the source of all wealth—as if the
transaction by which a citizen of Victoria,
selling a bag of potatoes to a resident of
Sydney, obtained the cash to buy a pair of
boots made in Melbourne, was not an immeas-
urably better economic bargain than one
by which a sheep’s coat sold in Hamburg
yielded a N. S. Wales family the price of a
hat built in Austria. It is all very well
now, after eating a “patriotic luncheon,” to
yell “Death to German trade!” but what the
neople of the Commonwealth want really to
hear is someone who will call “Life to Aus-
tralian trade!” —who will not only have this
cry on his lips, but in his heart the resolution,
and in his head the brains to convert words
into effort, systematised and real. *
The war is not going to last for ever. In
due time the world will turn from slaughter
to the pursuits of peace. The man with the
foreign accent and cheap goods in . his grip
will once again be prowling round in larger
numbers than ever, showing the poor, down-
trodden importer (who by tnat time will have
forgotten all the patriotic food he consumed)
how to swell his orofits on certain lines by
50 per cent. The temptation will be very
great. Then, again, an unaccustomed voice,
yet reminiscent of the bad old days before the
war, will assuredly be heard some morning at
the wool sales in Sydney and Melbourne and
Brisbane, clamorously offering three-six-
teenths of a penny a pound more than anyone
else for the goods on tap, while the agent
of a compatriot representing a foreign smelter
will be doing Lusiness round the corner with
a mining company having concentrates to
sell. What will be done about calamitous
circumstances like these? What is going to
be done now? To sit up over patriotic
refreshments and fiercely remark that
“Britain expects that everv man will do his
duty” and cheer with great enthusiasm is
not enough—not by many hundreds of miles.
And while references to “that huge trading
concern, John Bull and Company,” are at
the moment of grateful and comforting
sound to the daily press, it may be just as
well to remember that J. Bull’s system of
international trade can only be made to
dovetail in with the Australian view of the
situation by a mighty effort of the imagina-
tion. J. Bull runs more or less on Free-
trade lines; he is also the creditor of many
debtors, and a banker whose transactions
are world-wide. John may alter his fiscal
methods before long, but then, on the other
hand, he may not; and as many things are
going to be very cheap indeed in Germany
one of these days, there are more inconceiv-
able happenings than that John may buy
there in a wholesale way, for the purpose of
supplying his own varied requirements
and filling the estemed orders of his
customer at Billabong Creek. Then there
is the further contingency—not by any
means remote —that Germany may come to
the conclusion that Hans and Hannah
would be all the better for a more plentiful
supply of proteid in their food, and, in con-
sequence, may open the door to Australian
and Maoriland meat. Once the power of
Prussian junkerdom is broken, this is certain
to happen. That would create fresh compli-
cations for John Bull and Co., especially
for that section . of the firm which has got
itself hideously into debt of late years and
must by hook or by crook find every year
the cash to meet an enormous interest bill.

self-interest boil down to this —that the
present cataclysm teaches Australia, with
greater force than ever before, the paramount
importance of fostering on her own soil,
among her own people, a greater industrial
activity; of developing an industrial capacity
equal to satisfying all the requirements of
the community; of keeping certain foreign
goods out, not because she loathes a par-
ticular foreigner, but because to depend on
any of them is unspeakably bad business.
It cannot be supposed that important sec-
tions of the European race can be perman-
ently divided from all intercourse with one
another by the line of nationality. However
bitter the hatreds of to-day may be, it can
be usefully recalled that there have been
wars, horrors, racial hatreds and historic
enmities just as bitter, and that most of
them, so far as civilised people are con-
cerned, have lost their bitterness through
the . merciful influence of time. Let Aus-
tralia leap on the trade of the Hun by all
means and with both feet; but let the people
remember also that, so far as they are
concerned, this business is not going to be
settled, but only, side-tracked, unless the
Legislature applies itself honestly and
steadily to the job of industrial development
on the basis of a solid protection against the
manufactures of all foreigners, instead of
on the . unreliable foundation of personal
detestation. If for the old German trade
Australia merely substitutes a new. similar
trade in other directions, then she just
sticks in the same old rut; and that looks
very like what the purveyors of patriotic
lunches just now are after.
AUSTRALIA AND THE AEROPLANE.
The two big overhead raids by British on the
hindquarters of the German position were
highly destructive; and. generally, in pro-
portion to the cost of machines, number of
men employed and risks taken, the aero-
plane has proved itself more effective than
any other military weapon in use. The
lesson for Australia is of the largest im-
portance. Owing to the manner in which
this continent sits on the map, effective air
raids upon its shores must always be par-
ticularly difficult. On the other hand, an
unexpected covey of aeroplanes, rising from
any of our countless headlands, might de-
moralise and cripple, even if it did not en-
tirely knock-out, the most powerful invader
before he could attempt to plant his battle-
boot anywhere upon the coast. The great
advantage of the aeroplane for Australian
defence lies in the fact that the flying units
are so small. The most remote corners of
the most thinly-peopled States could
supply the necessary men for a corps;
and while the ports gave us the recruits for
our fleet, and the big towns and settle-
ments turned out as much army as they
could breed and train, the back country
could furnish the daring cloud riders who
would make the whole system of defence
more effective than we could hope for from a
mere count of our available heads. In an-
other 10 years or so Australia will have a
lot of men trained or partially trained for
home defence; but the difficulties of trans-
port, the size of the territory to be defended,
the immense length of the coast-line, and the
knowledge that the dangerous side of the
country is the one where the people don’t
live, are factors that knock the props from
any sublime confidence we might have in the
future. For the adequate defence of Aus-
tralia along ordinary lines, and by the
methods hitherto recognised, we require
a highly-trained army about as numer-
ous as our whole present population,
and a system of railways of uniform
gauge as well planned as those along
which the Germans have been rushing their
troops at shortest notice to the point where
Death was getting in his heaviest work.
Nothing sort of this could fully guarantee
our safety. Our fleet is something—something
very good and satisfactory to a point—but
there must be large expenditure of cash and
long years of waiting before we possess a
navy which can set its eye as often as once
a month on every possible landing-place of
the enemy. Our great hope, and indeed our
only hope, lies in our getting a little in
front of our possible invaders by developing
a means of defence which may enable the
few to meet the many. Towards this end the
aeroplane is the best contrivance in sight.
The surprise of the present war is the
amount of hand-to-hand scuffle it contains.
The bayonet has been constantly used to
make holes in the foe, and even the knife
of the Indian has been flashed to some pur-
pose. Big nations with their armed millions
in the field have relied less than might have
been expected on the work of modern inven-
tion, and have played the bitter game very
much as it was played by Cybus and Alex-
ander and J. CbESAR and John of Gaunt.
Guns bigger than ever are certainly there,
and the submarines crawl under tbe waves,
and a substance called turpinite is more
awful in its effect than the Gorgon’s eye; but
the main controversy always seems to be con-
ducted on the pattern of a viking raid with
plain cut and thrust and bash. All this is
bad for us, because it means that numbers
still count, and we lack the numbers. Yet it
has been shown that three dozen aeroplanes,
manned by less than a hundred men, can
raid the enemy’s rear and smash things with-
out losing a life in the process. On all ap-
pearances, then, there ought to be a howl for
more of such machines. A thousand of them
cost less in cash than a first-class battleship ;
and a thousand aeroplanes could certainly
carry more and wider destruction and demora-
lisation than one super-Dreadnought. It
is admittedly hard to drop a bomb
straight from a contraption moving
above the fleeting landscape at a higher
speed than an express train; but the
bomb-dropping trade is still in its experi-
mental stage, and it is certain that the flying
machine will yet move with greater accuracy
and safety, cover longer distances in its
flight, and deliver its punch with a surer aim.
Already it is the most uncomfortable thing
at the price in warfare ; before long it may
be efficient enough to strike terror into the
biggest gun ashore or afloat.
* * * *
All this ought to be good news for Aus-
tralia. With the aeroplane as the first
weapon in the national armory, we should
have more than a fighting chance to hold this
continent against any invader. The invader
would, of course, use the air too, but he must
do so at considerable disadvantage as long as
we were able to prevent his landing and
securing a base for his operations. With a
decent amount of co-operation between the
fleet and each aeroplane station, and with a
moderately complete system of wireless tele-
graphy, it ought to be possible to shovel fire-
works on his ships from the sky at some dis-
tance from the coast; and there is nothing
the warship of the future will detest more
than a hundredweight of cordite falling half
a mile and landing in the funnel. Even the
knowledge that aeroplanes are waiting to
attempt the trick will make the marauder
coy and shy, and keep him nervously wasting
coal before he attempts his descent. On a
cash basis, an aeroplane which costs a maxi-
mum of £2OOO stands a very fair chance of
making a hole in a warship which costs
£2,500,000; on a numerical basis, two men
in a biplane can, with luck and skill, knock
out a thousand men on a Dreadnought. Thus,
with an air service as our first line of de-
fence, we can multiply the effectiveness of
our cash expenditure by 1250, and our effec-
tive numerical strength by 500. So also we
need not doubt, in the light of recent events,
that if Britain could raid German territory
in a regular and systematic manner for six
weeks with, say, as many war-hawks as are
represented by the cost of three Dread-
noughts, the war would be over and the
Kaiser down on both knees yowling for
peace. But the trained airmen to do the work
do not exist. In spite of their previous know-
ledge bv experiments of what the aeroplane
cotild do, the authorities did not take the
machine seriously to any extent; and the
greatest war of all the years had been in full
blossom for many months before the Cux-
haven raid proved to the world what even a
small number of aircraft could accomplish.
Australia in her preparations for defence
has hitherto looked as shyly at the aeroplane
as a bush maiden at a sewing machine.
Months ago—or was it years?-—the Com-
monwealth imported some flying material
and two -well-accredited aerial experts. From
time to time vague, murmurous notes of the
doings of these people and things have found
their way into the papers. Recently we
were told that the Government was estab-
lishing a school of airmanship or something
of the sort; and any old time during the
next three years we may learn that a Gov-
ernment-trained airman has flown all the
way across the Yarra. This limping pain-
fully in the rear of the world’s progress is
a disheartening business. The aeroplane
should mean more to Australia than to any
other country, because there is no other
country similarly situated. Britain, France,
the United States, Canada, Germany and
even S’Africa may use the thing for de-
fence, but they must do so with the know-
ledge that their machines will be pitted
against other craft of the air in possibly
equal numbers and strength. Australia
alone among the lands may use them
to guard her shores with the tolerable cer-
tainty that they will be employed against a
foe that for lack of suitable bases cannot
hit back effectively with similar weapons.
We want a citizen army trained to the
highest point of efficiency; we want a larger
fleet, home-built and home-manned ; we want
a railway system of uniform gauge to link
up north and south by the shortest and best
route; and we want also to make all the use
we can of the military device which is swift-
est, deadliest and least costly in men and
money. With the terror of many wings
aiding the Fleet to guard our coasts, the
Labor party, and the Meat Trust, and the
congestionists, and Joe Cook, and the big
breweries, and the moving picture combine,
and Chidley, and the press censor could all
sleep more safely in their beds and with less
fear of rapine, sudden death and alien insult.
WHEN THE WAR GOD SOUNDS HIS
GONG.
Tpie world and Australia with it will in the
fullness of time learn many lessons from the
war-—lessons in finance, surgery, trading
with an enemy, the futility of people with
Crowns on their heads who “rule by Divine
Right”; lessons in courage, in forbearance,
in charity and in the thrilling heroism of
men and women; lessons not entirely of
the battlefield nor of the bursting force of
shrapnel. The day for finally sorting out
results and tabulating them and docketing
them away will, as a rule, only come when
victory and defeat have been decided.. But
there are some things that have to be
memorised now because they are just those
things the world wishes to forget.. One is
What War Means —its misery,, its horror, its
repulsiveness.
War means Just one thing—Hell, with the
hottest corners reserved for the under dog.
It always has meant this and always will.
From the censored newspapers published in
England and Australia the public would
judge that war nowadays in winter means
a certain degree of discomfort in wet
trenches, relieved by tunes on the mouth-
organ and spectacular evolutions of air
craft; the destruction of ancient ■ buildings ;
wild hand-to-hand struggles with the enemy;
knitting socks and making pyjamas at the
sewing-bee, and reading the babbling
trivialities of “Eye Witness.” War is
none of these things. It is U grim, horrible
monster, squeezing dry the country it
ravishes, carrying with it death in awful
forms, and all manner of wretchedness,
suffering and destruction, without regard
for age or sex or condition. Those neutral
newspaper correspondents who had the goad
or evil fortune to have the monster at close
quarters while accompanying the German
army of the West, could see no pageant.
“War is not a spectacle,” writes one. For
them at the rear it was “only a bad smell.”
Three months spent along the lines of
devastation left burned on this man's mind
a picture of woe unutterable —of a blasted
country-side and a famished people ; of
endless regiments marching to the smoking
battlefield and returning from it in a proces-
sion of trains carrying wounded and dying
freight; of funerals at every turn; of open
graves and hospitals and dressing stations ;
of dirt, disease and death:—
In Belgium I saw homeless men, women and chil-
dren by thousands and hundreds of thousands, tramp-
ing aimlessly along wind-swept, rain-washed roads,
fleeing from burning and devastated villages. I saw
them living like the beasts of the field upon such
things as the beasts of the field would reject. In
France I saw pastoral land over-run by soldiers and
racked by war until it seemed the very earth would
cry out for mercy. . . .In Germany innumerable men
maimed and mutilated in every conceivable fashion.
....In Holland the people of an already crowded
country wrestling valorously with the problem of
striving to feed and house enormous numbers of
penniless Belgium refugees. .. .In England more
thousands of these refugees, bewildered, broken by
misfortune.
And the worst woe of all was in a country
whose people had been lulled into a condition
of fancied security from invasion by
powerful neighbors—one of whom, when the
supposed necessity arose, disregarded its
obligation, while the other two were not
able to stay the blow.
* * * *
On the surface of things, and according
to the doctrines of the muddle-headed
pacificist, no country on earth had less need
of preparation for defence than Belgium,
and no country has suffered more cruelly
under the harrow of war. Her weakness
was her undoing. Had Belgium been ready
to argue the point with anything approach-
ing effectiveness, as she easily might have
been, there would have been no spiked
helmets in Flanders to-day, no homeless
population, no appeals to the world for
bread and pants. The Hun would have
been as reluctant to try to march over
several million armed Belgians as he is, for
instance, to try to turn the French right by
taking a short cut over Switzerland. The
difference is of course that in Switzerland
the manhood of the nation has been trained
to arms, and stands along the frontier with
rifle and bayonet. There is that much lesson
for Australia, besides the lesson of war
being an undesirable immigrant that cannot
be kept out by agreements between third
and fourth parties, but can be made to think
hard about landing where there are
submarines and battleships on the outskirts,
a whole population in the foreground
equipped with modern artillery, rifles and
aeroplanes, and well-defended strategic
railways for the transport of unpleasant-
ness. South Africa, Belgium, Switzerland
—even Germany itself—are all eloquent of
this. By the maintenance and efficiency of
a citizen army the only person whose
freedom is interfered with is the individual
who closes his eyes to the meaning of war—
who refuses to see that the price of national
supineness may be —in fact, assuredly will
be-—the over-running of his country by
liberated horror, the wholesale destruction
of homes and families, the scattering of
women and children as wandering beggars
on the face of the earth, and the massacre
of the untrained rabble who sought to check
the marauder’s career.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Roosting Time for Curses.
Queensland bus had numerous surpluses of
recent years, but it has by a shameless fake
got rid of them all, notwithstanding the
protests of the Auditor-General. . Now,
nob having any sinking fund, and having over
£11,700,000 of loans falling due at the
middle of the year, it must (1) bribe the
old holders to renew, (2) pay through the
nose for a new loan, or (3) repudiate. It
is, of course, trving to aret the bill renewed,
and is offering holders £1 per £lOO by way
of a bribe, with interest for the future at
the rate of 4J per cent. Simultaneously, as
it is certain that some people won’t or can’t
renew, it is offering the unconverted balance
to new subscribers on the same terms —41
per cent, per annum for every £99, with an
undertaking to pay the subscriber £lOO in
1920-25 for every £99 put up now. Inch


dentally it is paying an underwriting com-
mission on £4,000,000, so that one way and
another the new loan will cost very little
if anything short of 5 per cent —and most of
it was spent years ago on works which don’t
bring in 3J per cent. The railways, which
are by far the most profitable of the things
into which the State has put much loan
money, have only once in the last 15 years
returned more than 4 per cent., and they
have given as little as under 2 per cent. The
thumping increase in the interest bill will
mean more taxation for the future, and
already since 1902 the State taxation has
run up from 16s. 3d. to over £1 ss. per head
per annum. As in every other State, the
more Queensland has borrowed the more it
has had to pay in taxes; and the present
increase in the interest bill will have pre-
cisely the same result in that respect as the
borrowing of another two millions or so, with
not a stick or stone to show for it.
Offering the War Dogs a Sunday-school
Bun.
The extraordinary futility of Wood’n’ead
Wilson, split-vote President of the United
States, advocate of Freetrade and other
deforms, and delicate Sunday-school states-
man,. has never shown more fatiguingly than
in his last suggestion to the warring Euro-
pean Powers. He wants the track kept
open to German ports, in order that food for
the civilian population may be landed under
a guarantee that none of the eatables shall
be given to the soldiers. Of course, the real
guarantor in the case must be Germany, and
the impossible Wilson actually professes to
think that a country which wouldn’t observe
an international treaty and wouldn’t play the
war game according to the laws of nations,
would distribute wheat and tinned beef to her
own disadvantage once she had the goods in
her own control. Anyhow, what kind of
animal does Wilson take the German army
to be? Does he imagine that a thing like
that, with all the swords and guns in its
hands, would stay hungry when there was
food in the country? Or does he even think
that the people with food would allow the
army to hunger? As for the U.S.A. being
able to see that the tucker didn’t reach the
fighting line, can it be possible that the
President really fancies that the United
States has anything capable of backing his
kind intentions: If the Allies find it a
tough job to compel Germany to do some-
thing it doesn’t want to do, how does Wilson
think the United States will manage it? In
effect, for the suggested purpose, the
American country would be about as con-
clusive as an ancient Hebrew prophet crying
in the wilderness, or the massed umbrellas
of the Peace Society.

The Beer Pump and the Federal
Revenue.
The decision of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment to take over and run the grog business
in the Northern Territory raises the ques-
tion whether all matters relating to liquor
should not be placed in the hands of the
Commonwealth. Apart from other problems
connected with the sale of alcohol stands the
important matter of the public revenue. The
Commonwealth derives a very large portion
of its income from the use of liquor .; but it
is_ left to the States to say whether they
will continue to use it or go on the water
waggon. This means that it is within the
power of the States to cut off at short
notice a big slice of the Federal revenues.
In the case of N. S. Wales a poll is taken
every, three years which gives the electors
the right to shut down entirely on the sale
of the Curse. In the event of this poll
closing the pubs, throughout the State, a
very difficult position must arise. N. S.
Wales .would no longer be contributing a
proportional share to the revenue, and the
revenue itself would show a serious short-
age. Would the Commonwealth be justified
under the circumstances in paying to N. S.
Wales 255. per head of population as at pre-
sent? If the subsidy continued to be paid
on the usual scale, every other State in the
Federation would have a grievance: while if
the Commonwealth attempted to differentiate
between States and reduce the subsidy in the
case of one of them, the whole question as
to the revenue contributions of the various
States under, a thousand different headings
would be raised and the result would be
utter confusion. If someone could take an
axe and split N. S. Wales into two or three
States, the danger might still remain, though
it would be greatly reduced ; but while one
State has so large a proportion of the popu-
lation of the whole Commonwealth, and con-
trols matters which must affect the others,
the. Federal ship always runs a risk of
springing a leak. Little Tasmania might
veto the noise that pianos make, and thus,
by knocking out imported pianos, evade some
portion of her revenue contribution, and the
loss would hardly be noticed ; but the disap-
pearance of liquor duties from N. S. Wales
would leave a yawning gap that all the
world could see. To put Bung and all his
ways under the control of the Commonwealth
seems the most reasonable method of taking
time by the front end. Any State ought to
be glad to get rid of him.

Killing the Goose and Pawning its
Feathers to Buy Eggs.
Maoriland’s latest excuse for bursting up
some more of. Cohen’s hard-earned money
is contained in a hare-brained scheme to
drain Lake Rotoaira into the upper waters
of the Wanganui. The object is to increase
the volume of water in the stream for the
benefit of the tourist, who now bounces from
boulder to cataract in a river-boat with
armor-plated bottom, and incidentally of
the boarding-house keepers who live on him.
The probability that if river and lake were
connected up in this way the lake would
make a hurried bolt to the sea is of course a
mere detail. The Maoriland method of
handling the nation’s “great natural
resources” by first destroying them and
afterwards pawning the population to make
permanent and reproductive assets with the
proceeds is joyfully illustrated by the pro-
position hatched in Wanganui. The river
there was not long ago a magnificent
permanent waterway of great scenic beauty.
Much cash was expended in removing snags
and making it navigable for a long dis-
tance ; but while this was going on there
were fiends at work with axe and fire
denuding the country along the upper
reaches and the drainage areas on either
side. The inevitable consequences were
pointed to; but a somnolent Government,
greedy land jobbers and indifferent saw-
millers let the future go hang. The bush
was shorn away in wide swathes; the
tributary creeks which fed the main river
became raging torrents after rain and dry
watercourses in summer. Nature’s reser-
voir was torn asunder. The same thing is
going on along a dozen rivers with disastrous
effect. Having thus scrapped a great asset,
the demented suggestion follows of discount-
ing. a batch of p.n.’s for the purpose of
trying to make the remnants “permanent
and reproductive.” Maoriland is more in
need of protection from her cheap politicians
and loan-raising maniacs than against any
other possible enemy, for of every conceiv-
able menace these are the most sinister.

The N.S.W. Labor Party’s “Reformers.”
Having spent a month in loud whisperings
in public places and confidential discussions
on megaphones, and in exchanging exagger-
ated winks, the N.S.W. Parliamentary Labor
party met last week in a secrecy that could
be heard at Cloncurry, to elect a Minister
as successor to the late J. L. Treble. The
final choice by exhaustive ballot was George
Black, of Namoi, who defeated the large
Stuart-Robertson, a Sydne.v-sider, by
two votes. Black has accordingly been
invested with the collar and blinkers of office.
Robertson, for his part, merely made incon-
venient remarks, with the result that Hol-
man and Cann have since been explaining
at great length how entirely wrong their
friend’s conclusions are, and what a pity it is
that such an estimable member of the
organisation should be so mistaken about
his own identity. The essence of what
Robertson first had to say is that his can-
didature for a portfolio was supported by
members of the party • who regarded with
strong disfavor the behavior of the Ministry;
that he stood as a protest against Minis-
ters and encountered their personal opposi-
tion ; that the voting showed how real was
the discontent among the rank and file.
Everybody knows that all this is more true
than untrue, but quite naturally Holman
and the rest of them are not anxious to
have the curtain lifted. They have there-
fore, with the assistance of Pat McGarrt,
been most solemnly assuring the democracy
that Robertson is merely having his little
joke; that they never even dreamed of such
a thing as an anti-Ministerialist being on
the premises; that the votes cast for
Robertson were in recognition of his great
abilities and delightful personality. And
still Robertson refuses to be silent. He
insists that there is a discontented and dis-
gruntled section, and that it is particularly
enraged because Holman has failed (1) to
pass a Fair Rent Bill; (2) to remove the
penal clauses of the Arbitration Act; and
(3) to amend the Early Closing Act. But the
sorrowful wail contains no reference to any
anxiety among the alleged reformers about
the Norton-Grtffiths iniquity or the
ruinous orsry of borrowing into which the
party has been plunged; and their zeal for
a genuine rehabilitation of the Labor party
can be measured by this omission.

The Weak-kneed Co-operator.
According to evidence given to Victoria’s
Commission on the Fruit Industry, by the
Agricultural Department’s chief supervisor,
the middleman fruit agent is playing the
same destructive tricks on the business as
his piratical friends did with the butter
industry before the dairy farmer got sense
enough to co-operate with himself and stick
to his society. This authority swore that it
is the “usual custom of the trade” to average
prices—that is, to lump receipts and credit
each grower with the same price. This in-
famous practice, utterly discouraging to the
grower who produces first-class fruit and
grades and packs it properly, is bad enough
in itself, but it necessarily offers strong
inducement to the agent to be —well, not
insufferably honest. Few of them need that
inducement. Many agents, according to the
departmental officer, are also dealers, and
supply fruit to shopkeepers; and in such
cases their duty to the grower to get the
highest price conflicts with their duty to
supply the shopkeeper at the lowest price.
Complete, effective co-operation would
wipe out these anomalies and help the
grower immensely. But the grower is a
dull person, who has been scared by bogeys,
and refuses to give the “socialistic” policy
a fair chance. He has certainly tried it a
few times —sometimes with insufficient capi-
tal, often under the wrong kind of manage-
ment —and every time the agents have
assisted to smash his enterprise by outbidding
it among wavering growers. Then, the co-
operation duly smashed, the agent has pro-
ceeded to recoup himself at his leisure with
interest added. Knowing all this, and with
the lesson of the butter industry before him,
the fruit-grower persists in trusting the
sharks. He deserves what he gets.
“The Worst Roads in the World.”
The thing that does duty for a road in Syd-
ney’s suburbs, and even close up to the main
city thoroughfares, would not be climbed on
by self-respecting goats in a really civilised
country. People build their houses on the
edges of chasms and precipices, and go forth
to their toil treading delicately among
the unburied cats,? 'bid tins, vegetable refuse
and other abominations which accumulate
among the rocks and sand. Here and there
municipal authorities throw down two
barrow-loads of broken metal, and either do
nothing more with them at all, or cover them
with a foot of yellow clay which becomes glue
in wet weather. Here and there somebody
scatters a few gallons of tar and calls the
dried result asphalt. Here and there a citi-
zen twists his ankle on a pebble six feet in
diameter, and his Christian spirit is such
that he merely nurses the wounded member
and swears fitfully instead of gathering the
rock up and throwing it at the nearest
mayor. The endurance of the public is
nothing short of soul stirring. Has any-
body ever tried to work out the dead loss to
the city in wear and tear of boots, wheels
and temper involved in its remaining a
thousand years behind the worst-roaded city
in any,other allegedly civilised land? Decent
metal” may be scarce and expensive, but
the shame of the filthy, boulder-strewn sub-
urban streets must cost a lot more m actual
cash. In every suburb people pay rates,
but what they pay them for only the town
clerk knows, and he is much too great an
official to let anybody else into the secret.
The Greater Sydney scheme was supposed
to be making progress a few months ago,
but it seems to have tried to wander over
these streets and broken its neck. If the
city is really too tired to organise itself
under one central body, or if nobody cares
a hang about the matter, why not go the
whole hog and abolish the suburban muni-
cipalities too? What little work they
pretend to do they do so badly that the
community would get on better without
them. Many a citizen who owns a stucco
front and three dusty rose bushes would get
round with a pick and shovel and deliver a
knock-out to a few hundred of the worst
rocks at his own garden gate if he were
left to his own resources and freed from the
burden of a municipal council which doesn’t
do anything, mostly because it doesn’t know
how.
■ ; —♦ ;
No valid reason exists why Government De-
partments having relations with the public
should not be under the same obligations in
respect to sanitation as private individuals.
As things stand in N. S. Wales at present,
they are not. A private school, for instance,
has to conform, under risk of heavy penal-
ties, with regulations drawn up by Govern-
ment experts, to secm-j the health, comfort
and convenience of the children. The Edu-
cation Department can, however, disregard
these completely, and unless members of the
Assembly who recently spoke on the subject
were wildly inaccurate, it does so with a cal-
lous disregard of criticism. At any rate
these members were not contradicted' when
they declared that at many schools the con-
ditions are such as would bring about imme-
diate conviction were the Department not
exempt from the decencies required of mere
citizens. The situation has now been made
even more watertight than before by the
latest Public Health Bill, which provides
that “the Government may exempt any such
department or any part thereof from all or
any of the provisions above mentioned.”
This exempts also from the Pure Food Act,
the Sydney Corporations Act. the Local
Government Act and the Factories and
Shops Act. Apparently in this matter
Governments go on the legal maxim that
“the King can do no wrong”—all right in its
way, no doubt, but a fool of a doctrine when
the King runs bakeries and brickworks, and
factories and schools.

The too-greedy C.S.R. couldn't resist the
opportunity the war offered of turning an
honest shilling. As usual it found Banana-
land an easy mark, and put the price up
255. a ton. But Victoria and the Ma State
gave it the deaf ear and the scowling visage.
Not to be beaten, the co. asked Denham
to arrange matters. Denham hurried off
to the other States, and urged an increase
“in the interests of the farmers.” The States
smelt a rat, made inquiries and found that
the C.S.R. would get nearly the whole of
the lift. They accordingly told Denham
to get work. Matters stand like this: the
refiners make huge profits, the millers do
well, the laborers have Wages Boards, and
the farmers have to take any old price. The
arrangement is so unjust that even Denham
introduced a Cane Prices Board Bill: but
when the C.S.R. raised, its finger the Bill
was thrown overboard, with a stone tied
round its young, soft neck.
“J.G.” has a look at the timber-yard :
Advocacy in The Bulletin (18/2/’l5) of the
making of butter-boxes by the Government is not
likely to appeal to the crowd in office. Too many
of their friends would die of fright. Yet the idea
is a good one. The forestry system of Victoria is
all wrong. Thousands of acres of splendid timber
country have at different times been given over to
cookies for improvement with axe and firestick.
Thousands of pounds of possible revenue and enor-
mous numbers of trees have thus disappeared in
smoke, and most of the land is now merely covered
by a dense growth of fern. The time is ripe to
make a change. The biggest users of wood in the
State are the Railways, the Harbor Trust, the Tele-
graph Department and municipal councils. Just
now Melbourne wants millions of hardwood blocks
for street-paving; and bridge timber, sleepers, tele-
graph poles and sawn logs are in continual demand.
Instead of putting up sawmills and cutting what
timber is wanted for public purposes, the Govern-
ment calls on Private Enterprise to rush the peoples’
forests and ravish them. Of course the public pays
just what P. Enterprise & Co. asks, and as a rule
this is double the cost of the labor. Great savings could
be made if the forests were handled by the Govern-
ment, and, what would be of even greater value, the
immature trees would get protection. Then, perhaps,
our beautiful hardwoods would be more valued than
now and used for many of the purposes for which
foreign sticks are at present imported.
»
Contemplation of the war news every morn-
ing has given Andrew Fisher’s mind such
a military twist that, in order to do some-
thing on his own account, he contemplates
turning the flank of the Adelaide to Darwin
railway by making a sudden movement —to
Queensland. The nominal object is to pro-
vide a “strategic line” skirting three States
(S.A., N.S.W. and Q.), whereby troops may
be rapidly transported across the back coun-
try from south to north-east. The actual
object is to side-track a work to which the
Commonwealth stands committed by pre-
Federation contract, but to which few if any
votes are attached, for an undertaking that
will appeal to the eastern States, when
an election is pending. Why it should be
suddenly pushed forward as a matter of
great urgency is not explained, except by
vague, shadowy references to “strategy”
of some sort. The only things Fisher
seems to be certain about are that the cost
will be fifty millions, and that “we have
got the money.” The reply is that we have
not got the money; that no evidence justify-
ing a sudden leap into such an undertaking
exists; that even if it did the importance to
Australia of the central line remains as
pressing as ever; that the different States
have already thousands of miles of, strategic
railways which cannot yet be effectively
used ; and, finally, that the military autho-
rities are the worst possible advisers
in respect to. new railways, and are hope-
lessly wrong in their conceptions of the use
to which the existing lines can be employed
tor purposes of transport.
The Punishment.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A new formula of greeting is spreading in Ger-
many. It is “God punish England,” and the response
is: “God punish her.”— Cable.
God punish England !
With steel and with cordite,
With bullets whizzing through the air,
JJJth hurtful things thrown from great guns,
With bombs dropped from the sky,
With shouts and curses,
With hymns of hate,
With any old thing that may make a noise
or do damage—
God punish her!
God punish England !
Let it be done with great guns,
Let them throw tons of violent explosives,
lea, but the guns do not get forward;
Some of them are stuck in the mud;
And even when their roar is loudest
The English guns roar hack and are heard.
God punish England !
God punish England !
Let it be done with great masses of brave
men,
Let them rush forward hoching the Kaiser
vehemently,
Let them wallop the English till thev are
sore.
Yea, hut the brave men die like ants in
boiling water,
And if the English are punished somewhat
The blokes of the Fatherland get fits.
God punish England !
God punish England !
Let it be done with great ships.
Let the ships rush to battle proudly.
Yea, but the ships are still in the ditch.
And if they come out they are not ships
But only broken ironmongery at the bottom
of the sea.
And how shall England be punished
If Germany be hurt more than she?
God punish England !
God punish England !
Let it be done with Zeppelins,
Let the ships of the air go forth,
Let them be loaded with explosives,
Let them scurry across to England,
And perchance they may drop a bomb on a
nursemaid.
Or Jiit an old woman on the bonnet.
Yea, but England can still fight on ivithout
the nursemaid,
And even the funeral of an old woman
murdered
Will not keep her sons
From making holes in noisy and unnecessary
Germans.
God punish England !
God punish England!
Let it be done with some of the fast ships.
Let them dash up through the fog and begin
shooting.
And perchance they may kill an English
bricklayer,
A bricklayer on the top of a chimney,
Or a little boy whipping a top in the street.
Even if they miss altogether they will make
a loud noise,
They will make a loud noise and break
English glass.
Yea, but the English guns sweep the Ger-
man decks with flame,
And England is not punished though her
engines grow hot with the chase.
God punish England !
God punish England!
Let it be done by a very fierce Turk.
Let him rush up out of the desert.
Let the sag of his pants wave over the Suez
Canal.
Yea, but the Turk is hungry and in rags,
A nd, mad and tired and absent-minded.
And, will forget what he came for till he is
dead in the desert.
And England will not be hurt for all the
tchite bones on Mount Sinai,
God punish England !
God punish England !
Jt. is our only chance,
For Germany cannot do it,
Nor Germany’s unwashed allies,
Nor the big guns that have tried their
darnedest,
Nor the brave men that have died in heaps,
Nor the great ships that sit still in the ditch,
Nor the airships that drop bombs on nurse-
maids,
Nor the fast ships that run away burning.
God punish England.
The job is too big for us—
God punish her!

This war is not the result of Emperor William’s
action, hut came in defiance of his strenuous work in
the interests of peace. —-German writer.
He is a lover, and sweet Peace
His love. He wooed her day and night
With gallant words and no surcease
Of true devotion. If for Might
He strove it was (so I infer)
To make him strong to fight for her.
He built his swelling ships of war,
He garnered minted gold like corn,
He spread his ranks from shore to shore
And advertised his royal scorn
For Britain and her snapping pups
By taking half the shares in Kkupp’s.
His strategical lines he cast
To France and Belgium, that the scum
Might know that Germany at last
A frowning fortress has become,
Where roaring guns and bombs increase
For nothing but to keep the peace.
And now while lightning engines ply
To mow like grass opposing crews,
And from the cover of the sky
The airmen drop their murd’rous dews,
We wonder if this year they will
The Nobel Peace Prize give to Bill !

Having bolted from Suez as a place of
abomination, the Turk was at latest advices
reported to be gathering an army in Beer-
sheba, which suggests that in the course of
the next week or two this misguided person
may be heard of wandering unto Dan in
consequence of a rumor that the Russians
have crossed the Land of Nod and are throw-
ing shells even unto Canaan. In addition to
the trouble the Turk is in on the Asiatic side
British and French battleships are battering
down his fortifications along the Dardanelles,
in order to clear the way to Constantinople.
If this task can be successfully accomplished
and the fleet sits astride of the Turkish
domains at the Bosphorus, great will be the
consequences thereof. In anticipation the
Sultan has already packed his bag and taken
tickets for the interior. From Poland the
news each day is of mighty battles and grow-
ing heaps of slain. After sniffing at the
gigantic trap set for him by Von Hinder
burg, the Bear sprang to the rear
for a day or two; then, taking a
long breath, he leaped forwards and fell on
the staggered German once more and soon
had him fighting in the extremity of a
disastrous defeat. The war on this eastern
front is being waged with a persistence and
bloodiness without parallel—the dead in
hecatombs, the mangled in myriads, the
country drenched. Meanwhile, in the west,
where the gentle hand of spring is beginning
to lightly touch the outraged earth, both
sides are spending more time in the open
with the bayonet and less in mouldy dug-
outs with a mouth-organ. Slaughter will
presently be renewed on a scale appropriate
to preparations, and as the Allies’ line has
been materially strengthened, the conflict
will, no doubt, rival that waged all winter
by the heroes of Warsaw and the Vistula.
In Britain the incident of the week has been
a vivacious speech by Lloyd George, gene-
rated by what seems to be the reckless,
unpatriotic action of the Clyde engineers
engaged in the manufacture of shell casings
and other munitions of war. Breaking away
from the control of their executive, they
went on strike at a moment when work was
abundant. The madman at Berlin is not
the only lunatic the nation has to contend
with. Notes are still passing like a cloud
between Uncle Sam, John Bull and other
persons, and the Hun’s campaign of blowing
up everything that floats bears the aspect
of fiasco.
There was a hurried rush of the press to
N.S.W. Minister for Health one day last
week to ask what he proposed to do about
the “revelations” made bv Dr. Foreman,
chairman of the medical staff of the Sydney
Hospital for Women. The Minister said he
didn’t know, but (after taking a long breath)
would “get a report,” or see what the
British Medical Association had to say
about it. Dr. Foreman had illustrated by
statistics the extent of the trade carried on
in criminal operations—an industry which
for many years has been flourishing like the
nrickly pear. Briefly, his allegations were
that, of over a thousand cases treated at the
hospital, 10 per cent, were due to septic mal-
treatment ; that most of the surgical work
performed at the hospital arose from this
cause ; that all the other hospitals had similar
experiences; and that certain medical men,
chemists, quacks and “nurses” were vigor-
ously competing with each other in the busi-
ness. It reveals a deplorable condition of
affairs, this, of course ; but why pretend to
be astonished? The dreadful trade was
carried on with impunity for too many years
to leave any other sediment except an army
of reckless followers of the abortionist’s call-
ing. The prevalence of the practice may be
symptomatic of many things; but to igno-
rance, more than to any single cause, can the
readiness of women to participate in the
illicit trade be attributed. So long as the
bulk of them are brought up with a pro-
found lack of knowledge, just so long will
society have on hand the .problem of the
skilful criminal who knows his job and the
harpy armed with the kitchen tongs. If
women realised the certain physical disabili-
ties and moral degradation handed on to
them by this sinister business the crude hole-
and-corner surgery of the secluded street
would not be so eagerly sought after.
Asked by a deputation from trades-union
headquarters to explain the ruinous price
of beef and beer, Davy Hall (N.S.W.
Attorney-General) regretfully admitted that
the Necessary Commodities Coihmission had
turned out to be a lath painted like iron,
a load of empty jam-tins—any old thing, in
fact, except a useful one. “Prices have
gone up in spite of it,” he wailed, and the
deputation withdrew to further ponder the
fond idea that prices are to be suddenly and
effectively grappled with by an abbreviated
politician whistling up two or three men
from the street, supplying them with fees,
stationery and a secretary, and telling them
to get to business. Hall’s Commission was
taken seriously for a week. Then the seri-
ousness started to ooze out, and subsequent
wrestlings with the price of beer in pots and
glasses, and the earnings of the little boys
who sell the evening papers, suggested that
it wasn’t even melodrama —it was farce.

Julius Knight formally took over the
spreading hat and fur-bound overcoat of
“The Silver King” at Sydney Royal on
Saturday, and cleverly avoided doing Den-
ver’s dream-speech to death, thereby mak-
ing things easier than they might have been
for his sole traditional auditor, the aged and
infirm Jaikes, whose faithfulness was such
that no elderly house-dog could look at
him and keep its tail unwagged. Jaikes is
the sort of servitor who, in real life,
becomes an intolerable nuisance, and is only
protected from his employer’s feet by his
white hairs; but on the stage, where all is
false, he draws tears from bookmakers and
makes women sigh for the (purely imagin-
ary) days when such paragons of servile
virtue were to be found shuffling and cack-
ling in every hall for a microscopic wage.
At one point, the first night’s performance
resembled an illusionist’s entertainment.
At the end of the Hatton Garden murder
scene, the curtain descended hurriedly on a
horror-stricken, drink-dazed Denver draw-
ing a tablecloth over the dead body of
Geoffrey Ware. In response to insistent
applause, the curtain rushed up again and
revealed a perfectly-calm and obviously-
guiltless Denver soberly bowing his acknow-
ledgments. Body, tablecloth, bloodstains
—all had vanished! But it was the
only trick the King knew. When, later
on, he was loitering and listening outside his
distressed grass-widow’s door, and daughter
Cissy had fled with his purse and small
change, he couldn’t conjure back a half-
crown or a loaf of bread to relieve his
starving household.
Irene Browne, as Nellie Denver, gets along
very nicely in the well-gowned scenes; but
Irene drooping in the sad black garments of
bellowdramatic poverty, with a small, sad
basket on her arm, isn’t at all convincing.
One is haunted by the suspicion that the
absurd, three-sided house is really stuffed
with good gowns, and that she is only griev-
ing because she is not permitted to wear
them. Eardley Turner makes Jaikes a
lovable stage fiction, and Leslie Victor is a
trim and jaunty Corkett. Martin Lewis
makes a well-bred and harmless Ware whom
nobody would really trouble to murder.
Frank Harvey is an attractive stage
Raffles; George Chalmers is genuinely amus-
ing in the rich part of Elijah Coombe; and
Emma Temple earns her welcome in the
small part of Tabitha Durden. Dorothy
Seacombe, as the diminutive Cissy, is a
captivating little actress; she poses very
prettily with her elegant stage-mother, who
never yet spoiled a good gown by weeping in
it.
“THE SILVER KING ,” AT SYDNEY
ROYAL.
His master’s voice. The faithful servant
Jakes ( Eardley 'Turner) discovers his long-

It is good for Belgium that Germany
didn’t have a chance to see “Base Coin” at'
Sydney Adelphi before the invasion. By
comparison what happened to Liege , was a
mere Sunday-school Bible-class picnic, and
the most blood-stained bayonet charge in
the war a pleasant fairy tale. The pro-
gramme is good enough to tell you what to
expect: “A cruel conspiracy—The robbery
at the bank —A murderous plot—The
escape of No. 80 —A jealous Italian woman
—Cartwright puts on the screw —The mes-
merist and his victim —The false marriage
certificate —The murder —The hunted con-
vict —The Italian woman vows vengeance—
A free fight—Letty (heroine) in the toils—
‘The Smasher’s’ gang at work—The police
raid the counterfeiters’ den —The attempted
murder —‘Monkey’ dooms Bruce (hero) to a
horrible death —The struggle for life (alone
worth the money)—The lift tragedy—Seth
puts the screw on Cartwright—‘The Smasher’
at bay”—and then, to nicely wind up the
most blood-spattered bellowdrama that ever
murdered itself in four acts: “Virtue and
Honesty are as pure gold, whilst Vice and
Villainy are as Base Coin.” It only needs
to be added that the prices range from 6d.
to Is. 6d., and that the hero is understood
to be a retired curate. Present intentions
are to wipe up the blood finally to-morrow
night; though if the Federated Union of
Counterfeiters, Gaol-breakers and Murderers
were to petition the management the show
might be revived for a week. There
isn’t a member of the Federation in Sydney
who couldn’t learn something during the 11
scenes. On Saturday “Lady Godiva” will
be on view to any Peeping Tom who has the
wherewithal to square the door-keeper.
The Religious Editor attends an inter-
esting function: —
I was present last night in the Town Hall at
the public meeting convened by the Australian
Branch of the Royal British Literary Institute for
the purpose of considering what writers in English
should he voluntarily ceded to Germany.
The President (Sir Henry Buzzchump), who was re-
ceived with cheering, explained the purpose of the
“THE SILVER KING."
1. — The Silver King covers the murdered
man with a tablecloth. (Curtain.)
2. —Loud applause. Curtain is raised. Body
has disappeared. Very neat body-disposal work.
meeting with characteristic humor and brevity. He
said: ‘‘Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen: As you
are all aware, our thorough and painstaking enemy
has already claimed that Shakepeare, whom
we have always revered as a great Englishman, was
really a great German, and, as such, he has been
formally annexed by the Kaiser. I confess I do
not know why a good German should take as one
of his heroes Henry V.—the English king who had
the impudence to thrash France some hundreds of
years before the Kaiser tried and failed. But I
mention this instance of lese-majesty in order that
we may be the better able to treat with Germany
for an exchange. Ladies and Gentlemen, we cannot
spare Shakspeare; but there are many other writers
alive and dead whom we can spare very well.
(Hear, hear.) We have met here to-night to decide
on those whom we will cede in exchange for the
one whom we cannot yield. If Germany accepts
our terms, the living writers whom we honor will
be transported thither (by force if necessary) with
all their relations, books, manuscripts, autogiaphed
portraits and publishers’ remainders. The bones
of the dead writers ceded will be disinterred and
despatched with all available relics, monuments,
memorial tablets and so forth. I may add that,
though we have no control over United States
writers, we are compiling a list of people whom we
would like our friends across the water to give
away to the foe, and we are hoping they will act
upon our well-meant suggestions. Such an oppor-
tunity to make a clearance is unique in history and
is unlikely ever to happen again. Ladies and
Gentlemen, I will not detain you further. You have
your ballot papers and pencils.” (Great cheering,
during which Sir Henry resumed his seat next to
his Excellency the Governor.)
Then followed one of the most animated scenes I
have ever witnessed in my life. What made it more
impressive was the thought that, all ovei the
English-reading world, the same scene was being
enacted. The rustling of ballot papers in the hands
of the intelligent audience reminded me of the
gums when the southerly is combing their top-knots.
Over all was the whir of gossip and consultation.
When a quarter of an hour had passed, ushers
appeared with large cardboard ballot-boxes which,
when filled, were immediately sent behind, where the
staff of scrutineers was waiting. The careless chat-
ter of the moving assemblage continued till the first
name that had secured the necessary number of
votes went up on the scoring-board. There was a
sudden burst of cheering near the platform. Con-
versation everywhere stopped, and the great audience
turned expectantly and roared as it beheld the
name: “WOODROW WILSON, Birthday-Cable Spe-
cialist.” After that there was no idle looking-about
—only tense excitement and cheering as name suc-
ceeded name.
Here is a complete list of authors that confronted
the people at the end of the evening:—-
1. Woodrow Wilson.
2. Bernard Shaw.
3. Ella Wheeler Wilcox.
4. Hall Caine.
5. Marie Corelli.
6. Charles Garvice.
7. Myrtle Reed.
8. Foster Fraser.
9. Bruce Smith.
10. W. H. Fitchett.
11. Author of “East Lynne.”

leaves very little to be desired. George
Mozart, a newcomer from London, has com-

with his “thumb-nail sketches,” wherein he
caricatures many familiar types, and his
mimicry and burlesque are excellent. Ivanoff
and Keith, drawing-room dancers, are
dropping a few hints for the flapper who is
already thinking of the approaching three
dances per week; and contortionist King-
ston, Dooley and Sayles, Odiva and Laura
Guerite all boom as they did a week ago.

benefit of wowsers and other secret gamblers,
that the Demon of Chance will be the guest
of honor at the fancy-dress turnout at the

their costumes, competitors .will be branded
with numbers, and those carrying the chosen
ones will leave with cheques in their pockets.
Meanwhile, all the regular features of the
show are going strong, and the burning of
the village pub and escape of the inmates
continue the star thrills of the season.

The crowd at Melbourne Princess’s last
Saturday found a lot of entertainment in
“His Real Wife,” a drama wherein the
horrors have a distinct tendency to quaint-
ness, and the titter of incredulity waits upon
the shriek of pathos. Anything happens in
the- present weekly change of bill. The most
frequent occurrences are a poor rag-baby
born in mock wedlock, and a deserted, blind
grandfather who is struck sightless when
falsely accused of stealing soup-tureens from
the sideboard of a bloated British squire.
The blind ancient crops up from time to
time with invariable success. He has no
mother or little dawg to guide him, but he
gets there all the same, elocuting in fair,
round paunchy tones, with measured _ beat
and slow, like a farmer cursing the village
belle when the squire’s son is her beau. The
live rag-baby is replaced later on by a stone-
dead ditto picked up promiscuously in a
backyard in order to lend complication to
the plot. The villain rings the changes on
the baby’s mother, and she goes wandering
around with the casual bundle of mystery
in her arms until she faints on a river bank,
whereupon the villain puts the alleged infant
corpse in the bulrushes and calls the police.
After which the in-no-eent lady is convicted
of murder in a court where her penitent
mock-husband is officiating as judge in a
weird Robinson Crusoe headgear. She had
left her happy home because her bigamous
husband’s real mad wife blew in from a
motor accident and tried to murder the
family. The villain’s reason for pursuing
the gentle heroine and thrusting defunct in-
fants on her is understood to be purely
mercenary. He wants blackmail. Accom-
panied by a young assistant, who never seems
to know what the bloomin’ blank ’is blessed
gime is, the cheerful miscreant assumes
various bad characters. Finally he is cap-
tured in the disguise of a hokey-pokey
vendor, after giving evidence for the Crown
in the notorious rag-baby case. _ The counsel
for the prisoner had, however, disguised him-

ancestor descends upon the reprieved

stolen rag-baby is restored to mother’s
breast. Inman (as the stodgy, flippant

The tenth week of “Bought and Paid For.”

week, so the question whether Robert Staf-
ford has a right to come home to his wife
when he gets “full” is being freely answered
in the negative. Robert is generally regarded
as a poor sport.
“The Village Blacksmith” is dealing out
four acts of heartbreak to William Ander-
son’s customers in Melbourne this week.
John Strong, the son of toil, makes his own
trouble by listening greedily at the villain’s
mouth and crediting unfounded allegations
anent his wife’s character. With the help
of two unsober derelicts and another offensive
blot on the scenery, the crafty informer.
Captain Leo, succeeds in separating the
foolish blacksmith from his moister half and
nushing th°ni out in onpomte directions on
a hard and. cruel world. Soon muvver in-
highways and byways, parading
voluminous grief and a gawky cheild much
given to prayer, while farver becomes a
hoarse voice demanding beer by night. At
such times-the Caotain hovers as a friend,
urging papa to fill ’em up again, while offer-
ing mamma the devotion of a sinful heart.
When the whole troupe migrates to London,
the Captain is shown up by a victim of his

the muscular feature is cut out of the
present revival. Hastings (hero) isn’t a

Vox (the bad man) only seems equal to put-
ting a half nelson on a stick of celery. Both

Adelaide Repertory Theatre announces
that it had no connection with the success-
ful week of “This New Sin” at the Royal.
It wqs the same play and the same players
gave it at the Rep.; but the Rep. performs
only before its own subscribers. The piece
went well on the larger stage, most of the
amateurs concerned being as good as many
professionals. Ray Walsh was again the
humorous, self-sacrificing hero, Whittle the
Labor M.P. (stage version), and Douglas
Walsh the friend; also Hedley Jones was
the unpleasant person who is killed, and
Wadmore the worm who surprisingly turns
on him. Wilfrid Neill contented himself
with an old man-servant’s part, and elabo-
rated it with many clever touches. There
are no women in this remarkable drama.
Anderson’s “Sinbad,” with Carrie Moore in
it, is just replacing the other Sin at the
Royal. At the Austral Gardens, Ivanoff
continues to pour out really good music, and
Sydney James to chaff the company and the
audience to the delight of both. A comedian
who is different every evening is rare —and
delightful. There is nobody in the Dandies
who stands out like James, but the large co.
is strong all round, and Dorothv Gardner is
a clever little actress. West’s Pictures have
a South American drama. Wondergraph
advertises gleefully that some U.S.A. co. has
captured a particular film-actor from another
co. This news leaves the public quite cold ;
but some Central Australian views that this
house has are great.
Darkly and mysteriously the S. M.
Herald protests against “the suggestion
that important administrative posts shall

evidently heard the whisper that there is a
proposal to hand over to Works Minister
Griffith the position of Chairman of the
Irrigation Commission. However, the Min-
istry is not at all unanimous with regard to
this proposal; and the Herald isn’t nearly
as likely to be called on to congratulate
Griffith on getting his job as to felicitate
Willie Holman on being made Agent-
General.

“Private Boxer”: Once more the old “Sil-

the J. C. Williamson firm must have made
out of the famous piece! No wonder
J.C.W., every time he met Henry Arthur
Jones, implored him to "write another ‘Silver
King.’ ” No doubt George Titheradge, the
original Australian King, will have a look at
Julius Knight in the part; also Walter
Bentley, whose Scotch accent has been
heard in the title-r6le in many countries,
including ours. There must be as many
Silver Kings as Hamlets in the profesh.; but

tralia is concerned.

William Harrtgan hying the “soft answer"
on a wrathful Muriel Starr in “I he H eding
Morning .”
“O.Iv.”: Iu some Yankee vaudeville
turns” imported to this country, there is
more or less direct appeal for the Mrs.
Grundy vote, suggestive of America’s early
Puritan spirit. Two items in a recent pro-
gramme at Melbourne Tivoli may be in-
stanced. Wright and Dietrich, a pair of
exceptionally tuneful and loverlike duettists,
inform the audience in a confidential manner
that they are married, as though it is essen-
tial to guarantee the “thorough respect-
ability” of their canoodling, and prove that,
nobody need have moral scruples about giv-
ing their endearments a double encore.
Another U.S.A. performer who makes
reference to her respectability is Laura
Guerite, a boisterous singing comedienne,
who plays a lone hand in a series of gorgeous
costumes. Joyous Laura tells the audience
that it’s a strange way of earning a living
(which it isn’t), and then drops her voice
and adds : “But it’s honest.” Previous lively
ladies from America have reminded the audi-
ence that they were getting paid for it, as
though they were anxious to justify their
actions. Such explanations are uncalled for.
I don’t want to hear, in the middle of a
canoodling duet, that the soprano really is
the baritone’s wife. As for the honesty of
Miss Guerite’s mock heroics and things—
of course they are commercially honest. And
if any other cotton-field step dancer is danc-
ing cleverly, the fact that she is getting paid
for it requires no remark. If the dancing
were horribly crude the audience tvould like
to know whether she was drawing a salary,
and why? But in that case the inartistic
performer would say nothing.
“Yarra Ben”: Is bellowdrama dead ? And
if so who killed it? Not so long ago it was
the best paying proposition the theatrical
manager dealt with. Bland Holt retired on
the fortune he made out of the business, and
George Marlow didn’t do so badly in the
few years he provided Melbourne anil Sydney
with blood-and-thunder. But those things
don’t draw as of old. Willoughby. Ltd., is
making bread and butter, I should say, at
the Princess’s; but the days of jam on top
of the butter are no more. Bill Anderson
seems to be quitting the game. Soon, it
appears to me, we shall have looked our
last on the innocent village maiden, the
naughty squire, the falsely-accused hero and
all the old, familiar faces. It is all very
sad.
“Haresfoot”: Child celebrities do not
mostly fail in after life. Ellen Terry and
Mrs. Kendal, the two English leaders of
their generation, were both celebrated as
kiddies. So was Mrs. Bancroft, as Marie
Wilton. Ada Reeve and Ristori were
carried on the stage as babies, and con-
tinued as child actresses. Edmund Kean was
also caught young. The Bateman Sisters
excited notice as children playing important
Shakspearian roles, and grew up into favorite
actresses. Louie Freear was called “the
Female Robson” for her peculiar tragi-comic
ability from childhood up. Violet and
Florrie Lloyd and the four sisters Levey,
one remembered in Australia, advanced from
almost infant parts. The more we inquire
the more it appears a delusion that pre-
cocities fizzle. Look at the children’s com-
panies in Australia, turning out such as
Percy, Violet Varley, Chrissy Peachey. Flora
Graupner and many others. Our Fred
Leslie was likewise put to it young. The
Edouins. Willie, Rose, Eliza and Julia, were
astonishing as mites, and kept on doing
better. Jefferson, as Rip. in London, engaged
a clever boy and girl named Grattan. “Leave
them alone,” he said. “I want them to act
without knowing.” It was iust that precious
secret he seemed to have himself.
‘ Stargazer”: Despite the frequent bleat
about poor theatrical business, I believe
certain showmen are having the time of
their lives in Melbourne. Never were people
so easy to please. It seems to me that the
average man and his missus will pay up to
two bob to see any old thing that has in it
a rigid picture of the Belgian flag daubed
in color by the janitor, another of the Rus-
sian flag, one Union Jack, several execrable
transparencies of royalties, including the
Czar, the King of Belgium and George, and
one of the Kaiser to be received with execra-
tion and hisses; with a few worn films of
unrecognisable battleships, and seven color-
pictures of British bulldogs in various atti-
tudes, all patriotic. With loyal advertise-
ment and the help of ‘‘God Save the King”
this little lot can be sold at anything up to
2s. a head. Simultaneously we are so hardl
up that a State deficit of a million is looked
forward to with saintly resignation as some-
thing settled by Providence, and therefore:
quite unavoidable.
Beaumont Smith has promised Maoriland’
a stock co. to tour with estimable drama and
irreproachable comedy. First, samples will
be “Mr. Wu” and “The Barrier.”
Sarah Bernhardt has lost one of her legs,
so her career as an actress is definitely
closed. But. what a career! When the
Franco-Prussian war of 45 years ago threw
her out of work, she was already the most
talked-about actress in Europe. During the
siege of Paris the young Sarah, wlm was
then a marvel of slimness and restless
energy, figured almost as freely iu personal
paragraphs as Victor Hugo. She was then
notorious on account of her lean, agitated
arm. To-day it is poor Sarah’s plump
amputated leg that more than Paris talks
about.
“Melb”: Anderson’s lease of Melb. King’s
expires, and the place is on offer for nve
years. I expect to see him there again,
though American and English interests will
give an eye to it. Tallis, Ward and Meynell
will pass it by. They have plenty on liand,
with the natty little Williamson comedy
theatre in embryo. Yet they once took the
King’s from Anderson, who has been so much
addicted of late to sub-leasing that it is fair
to speculate that his own business has not
been what it was. The last playhouse in
the market was the Royal. Bland Holt
had nicked it out of the gutter, but he could
not go the £lOO a week of Meynell, Clarke,
Wren and Gunn. The Opera House is £lO4
a week.
From London: The best war play in sight
is “The Man Who Stayed at Home.” He
is (of course) supposed to be a coward, and
(of course) pretends to be an ass of the
Pimpernel type, and is fof course) more
like Sherlock Holmes, and bowls out a whole
team of German spies, with a wireless in
the chimney. Talking of the war, Feme
Rogers, the young American who was play-
ing principal girl in the Drury Lane panto.,
was so pro-German that the other players
struck against working with her; on
which she threw off her pretties and returned
to the U.S.A.
“ J.F.H.” : Harry Lauder has got back to
us in London, and is talking columns about
Australia and Maoriland. “Wonderful” is
the most frequent word. By way of grati-
tude for his own “enormous success” he
has written “A Song About Australia.” It
is “a land where the sun shines nearly every
day”; likewise the land for “the man with
big strong arms”; also the skies are ever
blue and the people are happy seven days a
week. Furthermore:—
The soft wind blows, and the gum-tree grows
As far as you can see,
Where the magpie chaffs and the Koocoburri laughs,
Australia is the land for me.
The last line is, of course, mere poetic
license. Still, he intends to make another
tour if he can arrange it ; which suggests
that the whole truth might be told by
amending the last line —
Where I’ll once more. chase the bawbee.
G. B. Pshaw evidently knew something
when, in “Arms and the Man,” he made an
inordinate fondness for chocolates a charac-
teristic of the modern warrior. Says official
reporter Bean in a recent despatch from
Egypt: “I believe the Australian could go
without almost anything rather than his
lolly shop. The English chemist opposite
the gate of Mena House, ™ho has just re-
ceived a hastily-ordered consignment of choco-
lates from Switzerland, said, ‘I never realised
that an army could eat so many sweets.’ ”
Talking about revivals, “Charley’s Aunt”
has been played so often that there is now a
club in London composed entirely of actors
and actresses who have at some time taken
parts in it.
There was a boom in London playgoing
at latest mail advices —a reaction from the
war slump. “I have never known London
theatres do a bigger business,” reports one
veteran manager. Most are acting on Sir
George Alexander’s advice: “Go in for
comedy; the public loves it; nothing can
be successful without humor.”
“Masetto”: “A.L.K.” (B. 25/2/T5) com-
plains of me furthering a dreary wheeze in
stating that Verdi and other Italian music-
makers were. influenced by Wagner. Dreary
or not, I reiterate the wheeze. Verdi was
swayed by Wagner in the same manner as
the latter was impressed by Weber. Wagner
admits this debt. As to “Wagner’s work
being based on a strictly individual and
quite fallacious theory,” that is a mere matter
of opinion, and space prevents me from hav-
ing a tilt at it.

SOCIETY
Sydney City Council is still vaguely won-
dering what to do with Queen Victoria
Markets. The building has always been a
financial white elephant and a failure
generally. The basement, intended to be
the ‘ markets,” was found absolutely unsuit-
able for that purpose; and although the
suggestion was made subsequently that it
should be turned into a swimming bath, a
conviction has since been established that
it isn t suitable for anything. As every
alderman had a bright idea about what was
best to do, naturally nothing at all has been
done. The latest decision is to continue
doing nothing “until after the war.” In
the aldermanic mind the war is like a
ciicket match a fine excuse for sitting
down in a comfortable place and letting
business slide. The only thing that keeps
steadily at work is the interest on the over-
draft.
“O.Iv.”: A few unconvincing pleaders,
representing a poor little Spiritualistic
“Church” in a Melbourne suburb, waited
upon Chief Secretary Murray the other day
with a request that the Victorian Govern-
ment would register them as a “religious
body.” They couldn’t have struck a tougher
infidel, as regards mediums, manifestations,
etc., than John Murray. Regarding spirit-
ualism from a fleshly, practical point of
view, he asked the deputation to explain the
purpose of their little church, its bearing
on the salvation of the community at large,
and the strength of its claim to become a
licensed marriage-shop. The earnest spirit-
ualists could only say that at present they
are stigmatised by scornful unbelievers as
deluded jugginses, and they want the stigma
to be removed by registration. In short,
they wanted John to admit officially that
they are not jugginses, in which case they
would be happy to assist the police in
“putting down” fortune-tellers. But John
could see no religious force in a spirit-
ualism which is worthless to punters. He
wanted to know the winner of the New-
market Handicap; and it was admitted
that on this subject the Church of Clair-
voyancy was no use. The spook-raisers and
seers of the invisible could sometimes “look
into the future, but not for selfish reasons.”
Being, moreover, unable to suggest how their
nebulous faith could be much good for any-
thing else, they were turned down. As
fleshly John Murray sees, there is nothing
to be said in favor of registering prophets
who can’t unselfishly predict next day’s
weather, or foresee the duration of the
present war, or summon the spirit of Napo-
leon Bonaparte to tell us what he thinks
about it.
Glenelg, Adelaide’s pet seaside town, has
had a Zeppelin scare. It saw dark objects
hovering over the sea after sunset. Quite a
lot of people saw them. Even the policeman
could see them. Airships, of course! Where
from? That was for the authorities to find
out. The authorities were not worrying.
Then an advertising firm announced that
these were its box-kites, practising for a
coming festival. Glenelg replied indignantly
that it had seen those kites in their packing,
but they had not been unpacked at the time
of the alleged miracle. So now there is much
argument, and contradiction, and jocular
suggestion that Glenelg mixes its drinks. No
bombs have been dropped so far, anyway.
NO INCONVENIENCE AT ALL.
ETHEL: “ I don’t half like telling you, Arthur,
but father says that in future he’s going to
tarn out the gas at a quarter-past ten.”
A RTHUR: “Don't worry, little girl. I’ll come
round after he’s done it.”
At the Caulfield (Vic.) Court the P.M.
on duty stumbled so heavily over both feet
recently that the Supreme Court had to be
asked for an opinion on the subject. The
charge was against a youth under 18 for
driving a motor-car without having a license.
The law provides that no unlicensed person
shall drive a car, and that no person under
IS shall be granted a license. Nevertheless Dr.
Cole discharged the ticketless youth on the
novel ground that no one could be punished
for being without what he could not obtain.
On an order for review, Justice Hodges looked
at this knock-kneed argument with great
severity for a few minutes and then briefly
remarked that a fine of 20s. would make ail
square.
GROUND FOR DIVORCE.
GEORGE: “ He’s a carping sort of brute, and she’s leaving him. She says he has destroyed
her faith in her Maker.”
JESS: “ Yes, I've heard her. She means her dressmaker.”
“Harrison O.”: I have lately been made
to realise the tragedy of a millionaire’s life
—the dreadful strain of trying to get rid of
money and being baulked at every point. The
other day I received a large, important-look-
ing document telling me that unless my in-
come tax was paid before (I forget exactly
when) something drastic would be done.
With visions of solitary confinement, I
rushed to the Income Tax office. Arriving
before five in the afternoon, I found the
place closed. I consulted the liftman, who
told me that they closed the office every after-
noon at half-past four. I said I supposed it
was no use waiting, and the liftman agreed
with me. Next day I arrived before four,
and heaved a sigh of relief, thinking I would
at last be able to discharge the debt and
save the Government from bankruptcy and
myself from gaol. My hopes were dashed
to the cocoanut matting; for a very superior
young man explained that, though the office
might look as though it were open, it was
really nothing of the sort. The clerks decor-
ated the place until 4.30, but they were for-
bidden. under regulation D 4780, to receive
cash after 3 o’clock. I begged him to take
mine as a personal favor, but he declined.
On the way out I asked the liftman what he
thought I should do about it. He suggested
that I should hire a room in the building,
sleep there, and dash out with my coin first
thing in the morning before they had time
to close the office. Circumstances prevented
me from acting on his advice, so my tax is
still unpaid. What’s more, I don’t feel like
bothering about it further; so if in the near
future you should miss my bright, clever
paragraphs for a week or two, you will know
that I am putting in my “solitary.”
Four years ago the Broadford ( Vic.) ceme-
tery trustees sought permission from the
Board of Health to purchase two allotments
of land close to the cemetery. Twelve months
elapsed before the consent arrived. The
trustees then made application for the clos-
ing of the road which cuts off the cemetery
from the allotments. After correspondence
between the Board, the Works Department
and the long-suffering (and honorary) trus-
tees, more consent came along—l 2 months
later. Then the trustees found it was neces-
sary to get more permission to fence the
allotments and the road. Once again the
letter writing recommenced; but this time,
though there has been two years’ corresnond-
ence. no additional consent has been forth-
coming. From all appearances the cemetery
will be filled long before a supply comes to
hand, and the trustees themselves will be
included. Couldn’t some consent be in-
dented from Germany with the next lot of
red tape the Government imports?
“Hamer”: The shutters have been put
up on more than one all-night Sydney eatery
since the war started. The Hole in
the Wall in Castlereagh-street (there is
another Hole in the Wall in Wynyard-
lane, but that’s a drinkery and it spells
itself ’Ole in the Wall) has passed
out. In days of old it did a flourish-
ing business with hungry fortune-seekers
and other people. In the first instance the
stall was located on a vacant allotment inside
a hoarding; but since the land has been built
upon it has been more substantially housed.
Of recent years the growth of Chow eating-
places and the turn of the appetide in favor
of chop suey and long duck have drawn away
many customers. Enlistment for the war,
and possibly the fact that some people can’t
now afford to go gay, may also account for
something. At all events, the Hole in the Wall
has been sold, and the door is closed, and
nothing remains but the sign on the window
and the orifice in the glass panel made one
night by the joyous fist of a customer.

THE GALLANT OLD BRIGADE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To distant lands the knuts have gone
Who formed the flirting line,
And ardent girls are rightly prone
For lost delights to pine;
The knuts are scarce, and now’s our chance
To haste to Beauty’s aid,
When she shall cast her eyes askance
And summon with a furtive glance
The Gallant Old Brigade.
We walk not in a knutty way,
We offer no offence;
One learns the nicest things to say
From long experience.
The knut too oft was rash and rude,
He scared the prudent maid;
How softly shrewd, polite, subdued,
The Gallant Old Brigade!
Let youngsters in their manly pride
Respond to war’s alarms ;
We simply cock our hats and bide
A silent call to arms;
The warmer will that summons be
The longer ’tis delayed—-
The knuts are far beyond the sea,
The girls are here, and so are we,
The Gallant Old Brigade.
On shingled shore, in shady dell,
We’ll bravely play our parts ;
We’ll do our best, aye, do it well
To soothe the aching hearts;
Our motto terse, is Watch and Wait
Till patience be repaid;
The lonely darlings, soon or late,
Must give the signal, sure as fate :
“Advance the Old Brigade!”
Midst autumn mists they’ll turn to us,
And meekly lead us on;
We will, of course, at first discuss
The heroes who have gone ;
Then talk of chiffons, likewise lace,
Of flowers that bloom and fade,
Of dimples sweet in Beauty’s face
And limbs that curve with matchless grace—
What-o ! the yid Brigade !
The wooer wise, whose weight of years
Lies lightly on his tong;ue,
Sounds youthful to the woman’s ears —-
Her “boy” is always young.
When placid moon shines high above
The sheltered beach or glade,
Her silver beams engender love
And glorify grey members of
'The Gallant Old Brigade.
Though absence make the heart grow fond
For just a month or two,
Propinquity’s the only bond
That holds a woman true.
Love asks her due, and Love’s reward
Must to her lips be paid;
The johnnies who are now abroad
Can’t kiss and squeeze, on sand or sward,
Like Gallant Old Brigade.
So, here’s to happiness in view,
To conquests still in store!
The raptures red we will renew
That thrilled our souls of yore.
For Nature rules all womankind,
Its laws will be obeyed,
And cruel war is well designed
To serve the heroes left behind—
The Gallant Old Brigade.
VICTORIA.

“Vagabond,” from a “dug-in” in France:
In spite of Australia's dry-canteen principles,
I doubt if the men from down-under will with-
stand the temptation of the regular Army issue of
rum, if they get here before this weather breaks.
Said issue is fairly frequent—two or three or four
times a week, depending on our proximity to the
main rum-cask, I suppose; and I’ve known the
most rabid blue-ribboners succumb to the tempter.
The liquor is plus A 1 quality, as I’ve heard de-
clared by experts; and when a man has had a spell
of standing- in the trenches with high-water mark
anywhere from his ankles to his elbows, or when
he strikes his billet after a long and wet and weary
march in darkness and bitter cold, the cry of “Rum
up” sounds in his ears like the singing of an angel
choir. Maybe the teetotalists of Australia will raise
;.the wail of woe in the newspapers when they hear
that free rum is to be the portion of their beloved
Soft Drink Brigades. But their lamentations are
likely to fall on deaf ears at the War Office. The
hard —and, to wowsers, unpalatable—fact is that
the inside wet is reckoned to give the knock-out to
the ills that arise from the outside wet. Apart
from that, I admit, although I never used to
have any hanker for rum as a pleasure drink, now
my ears prick up as- joyfully as the next man’s
when the Rum Roll-up sounds. It’s a small tot
that is issued, but it is strong enough neat to
bring tears to the eyes of a frozen Canterbury
mutton.
After the Marsden Cross was erected at
Russell (M.L.) about eight years ago doubts
arose about the. thing being in the right
place, . and during the recent centenary
gathering on the historic spot much contro-
versy raged around that problem. The idea
had been to place the memorial exactly where
old Sam Marsden on Christmas Day, 1814,
after his arrival from Sydney, placed the altar
for the first Christian service in Maoriland.
As Marsden neglected to drive in a peg the
spot has got mislaid, and as the sea front
has changed in the intervening century his
description isn’t much of a guide. The
f™eral idea is that the right spot is about
100 yards from where the cross stands.
Anyhow, the memorial is planted in a rotten
position. It should have been placed right
on the top of Matakau, the high hill rising
from Rangihona Bay, where Marsden landed.
This peak, besides overhanging the bay, looks
down on the wide Pacific outside, and on a
cairn there the Marsden Cross would have
stood out on the skyline visible from the
deck of every passing steamer. In its
present position it cannot be seen without
a special journey being made for the pur-
pose. The planter of monuments always
needs to have imagination, but rarely does
one of the tribe have any, and then it seems
to have been an accident.
JUST THE THING.
“Do you consider she has good taste?”
“Oh, certainly—not at all overdressed, I think.”
“Bush Thompson”: I herewith smite on
both sides of the face and counter in the
rear with No. 9 boots the person with a
name like a tourist’s trousers who, in a
recent Bulletin, asks himself whether a
Christian who fights is a Christian. “To
turn the other cheek, etc., is the foundation
plank of the Christian platform,” he mews.
No, it is not. The foundation planks are
Faith, Hope and Charity; and plenty of
good Christians are running bayonets into
one another to-day without violation of their
principles. A young man asked Jesus what
he must do to reach Heaven. “Keep the
Commandments,” was the reply. The young
man said he had done so. What more? “If
you will be perfect,” he was told, “sell what
you have, and give to the poor.” Why not
a controversy on whether a Christian who
owns a cat can be a Christian? It could be
started by someone commencing thus: “To
sell all you have and give to the poor is the
foundation plank of the Christian platform,
therefore” It would be no more essentially
idiotic than the 1 other.
Egypt is now getting a taste of the Aus-
tralian’s beastly habit of decorating the
scenery by carving on it his name, or his
girl’s name, or the initials of the two of them
inside a pierced heart. A Salv’army warrior,
serving with the Australians alongside the
Nile, sends the boast of it to his vapid War
Cry :
A week ago myself and three pals made the ascent
of the Great Pyramid of Cheops. Phew! that was
a climb. I chiselled our patronymics on one of the
stones. Posterity please note.
The initials of this person were given as
“C.P.,” which undoubtedly stands for some-
thing like Charles Pigtrough.
“Y.Z.”: According to an Australian press-
man in London, the “dreadful report” of the
Federal Memorials Committee on Lambert’s
painting of Geo. Reid is pasted up in
every art club and artists’ resort in England
as an object of derision. The order is practi-
cally that the portrait is to be “prettied up.”
It is probably that the committee in taking
this action is considering the feelings of
G. Reid more than the sacred prerogatives of
Art; for Reid grows more touchy in his latter
years about what he calls “pictorial misrepre-
sentation.” Which means that our wry Com-
missioner, losing his old sense of humor,
begins to hate to see himself as others see
him.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” writes with his
pen dipped in rum :
Apropos that S. M. Herald corner which, for in-
sufficient reason, it is vaguely proposed to name
Parkes’s Cross, in mild celebration of the old
man’s centenary. If the place needs a name two
better have been suggested. And there are other
historic claimants who might be remembered.
Where the Herald now comforts its ad-
vertisers there was a very ancient inn named the
Red Cow, kept by one who came in the First
Fleet. An old salt, Captain Birnie, lived at the
rear, facing O’Connell-street. After the Red Cow
man (1807) came Mary Newton. In that year
there were three lady-leaseholders close to the
Hunter-Pitt-street intersection—Mary Newton, Ann
Robinson and Rosetta Marsh. Rosetta had a spirit
license. She married Sam Terry, and that started
him on his Way to his million. The other ladies
no doubt likewise dealt in grog. Next Mrs. Newton
was Lieutenant McKellar, and close by Sergeant
Whittle—Governor Bligh's “horror”—who also sold
grog. Another neighbor was Solomon Wiseman, “a
guest” over a little smuggling transaction. He also
sold grog. Name the Herald corner “Rum-shrub,”
if you want to fit the moniker to old times.
A neutral correspondent who spent two
or three months with the German armies
says that one of the most singular features
or the struggle from where he saw it was
that he never once encountered a man who
had been wounded by a bayonet. At the
surgical dressing stations, in hospitals, in
the mournful trains carrying back to the
Fatherland regiments of shattered wrecks,
not one case of contact with the cold steel
did he find. Further, the principal military
HER OWN FAULT.
"We women are never understood.”
“So few of you try to make yourselves plain.”
surgeon at Mauberge, an important railway
depot through which crowds of wounded
Germans were drafted, told him that,
though he had been on duty there nearly 12
weeks, no bayoneted soldier had been
handled by the staff. Of men wounded by
shrapnel, thousands; of men bowled over by
rifle fire, also thousands. Of men spitted
by tho steel the correspondent could hear
nothing. Which supports the early
Bxjlletin opinion that, in spite of all that
has been done by the ingenious devisers of
butchering tools, the most fatal weapon is a
meat-axe. If you can get close enough to
use it, a hospital is of no use afterwards to
the other party.
“Cynic”: How far is war traceable to
feminine influences? In Melbourne Argus
lately there was a gruesome description of
fighting in Flanders, explosions, headless
trunks, severed limbs, and the heavens rain-
ing red dew. Two columns away was a
horrifying account of the exchange of
thousands of blind and permanently maimed
prisoners. Just below was the tale of 150
malaria-stricken Australians returned from
Papua. Wedged in between all this were
some sweet little verses, “Oh! do enlist to-
day !” with a feminine signature. On the
other side news of horrible carnage in the
German ranks—“crowds of Germans mown
down like hay”—which, it was said, only
led the homely haus-fraus to “render it im-
possible for a man to remain at home.”
These women even tormented voung boys
who had not yet offered their bodies, in
another paper appears a very sickening
story of outrage by Bavarian women upon
a man who bad already suffered for refusing
to serve. As long as the great war lords
desire hecatombs of human sacrifices, they
will apparently find sweet, gentle angels in
petticoats ready to minister to their needs.
According to London reports, the British
War Office has tested another explosive and
decided to adopt it. The awful stuff is said
to go off with a blast of flame about a mile
long and an eighth of a mile wide, and every
thing in its road is instantly deader than
Mary Queen of Scots. _lt is suggested that it
was with reference to its use that Kitchener
said the war would really begin in May.
Unfortunately the stories of these new agents
of destruction have to be taken with a
spoonful of mustard or something. Why,
for instance, wmit till May, even though only
a few handfuls of the stuff may be available
in March?
“Sarto” : A few days
ago there was wafted
into a southern N. S.
Wales town a gay dog
surrounded by a naval
uniform and more or
less supported by a
caue. First he looked
up an expensive
clergyman—a canon,
no 1e s s—explaining
that he had been asked •
to call by a certain
bishop, and introduced
himself as Engineer-
Commander Coleman,
of H.M.A.S. Sydney.
The canon was
c-harme d. spread
luncheon, and after-
wards led his lion on
a visit to the school,
where a graphic lec-
ture was delivered to
the children. Later
the man who had stood
at the Sydney’s
throttle when the Em-
den was done for was
taken in hand by some
more of the leading
citizens. Patriotic par-
ties had conceived the
idea of tendering a
dinner to him, when
somebody’s suspicions
were agitated to the
extent of telegraphic
inquiries. Romance
went down and out once more with
the arrival of the police, who recog-
nised in the “Engineer-Commander” an
old and regular customer. The ob-
jurgations of the leading citizens were
something to be remembered. As for the
canon, like a wise shepherd he prayed in
secret for his erring brother.
The military musings of “0.K.” :
Half the world doesn’t know how the other half
can live much longer.
Death is learning a lot from this war. Every
day he is taught new tricks.
The art of war is desperately wicked.
Poltroons are the poultry of mankind.' The brave
die game.
There’s many a slip twixt the sub. and the ship.
The life of a sub. is an uncertain thing—here
to-day and gone to sorrow.
German sailors know no fear. They brave any-
thing but the elements, and have nothing to be
afraid of.
The latest German troops are mostly fat citizens
plucked from bier gardens.
At first the Germans spoke of a triumphant walk-
over. Then they talked of winning in the long run.
Now they promise to fight to the bitter end. The
biter bittered.
The Kaiser’s battleships were, it was said, being
built for the protection of Germany’s mercantile
marine. As soon as war broke out the Dreadnoughts
ran to shelter and the merchantmen ceased to run
anywhere.
How much the dunce who joins the volunteers
Excels the dunce who stops at home and sneers!
Thusfar the Kaiser has kept himself blind-drunk
on crude German spirit.
Physicians may give a scientific term to the
trouble in the Kaiser’s throat. But we know the
common name. It is the death rattle.
A minute attention to detail is often neces-
sary to success, but there are times when it
leads to disaster. A lady in trouble at Gol-
lingwood (Vic.) could tell you about it. Her
family history sets forth that she was mar-
ried three years ago, being then 21 but, it
is alleged, incapable of bearing children, of
which fact her husband was not unnaturally
ignorant. Eighteen months later she told
him she was about to make him a father, and
retired to a private hospital, where she
acquired a baby girl. The infant proved
such a boon that the lady lately decided to
acquire another —a boy—and went through a
similar performance. To carry out the
undertaking properly she applied for and
obtained the Maternity Bonus— and that’s
where she made a mistake in detail, because
the infant’s real mother had alreadv got the
liver. She is now committed for trial. And
her husband, in the intervals of toil is
probably thinking. It is a matter that will
stand a lot of thinking, too, and the more
the meditation the more involved the whole
thing gets.

The president of the Victorian Employers’ Federation contended that the Boards which fixed the minimum wages for workers in employment never supposed that
they were creating a scale for workers who might be unemployed in a time of national 'distress. Employers might reasonably take the view that the principle of the minimum
wage, applicable as it might be to prosperous'conditions, should not apply when the taxpayers were asked to provide wages for the unemployed. —News item.

AN INTERESTING
EXPERIMENT.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey Hairs
make, just lay a piece of paper over each of the two
halves of the above portrait. The Grey “half” will
then be seen to have the appearance of 45 years of
age, whereas the other half looks only 30. Dr. B.
Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut Stain will make
all those years of difference if you are grey or prema-
turely grey. It is perfectly harmless, easy to apply,
and will quickly restore the Hair to the natural shade
of youth, or younger years.

“Silas Snell" : Tom Honor’s marriage with
Jinny Wells was not an ostentatious affair. Tom
married her, but with an air of reluctance. He
told the parson when asked “Wilt thou?” “Oh, go
on! Ez we’ve got this fur, I'll see it through.” But
on the third day following, the happy man called
on Jinny’s father at his own home with a fair offer.
“I want yeh t’ take Jinny back,” said he, “ "n’ I'll
throw me white horse in.” Old Wells refused. “1 iv
got her; y'ill keep her,” he said succinctly. Next
day Tom got his wife a job as general at the
Windmill Hotel, but when lie put the matter to
Jinny she said she was a decent married woman, and
wasn’t going to be “nobody’s servinkt.” Tom
pleaded with her. “But it’s 12 bob a week, woman,”
he argued. Jinny didn’t care. “What did yeh
marry me fer?” she asked. “I dunno,” said Tom.
“1 didn’t reckon I was goin’ t’ have yeh always
around.” Tom went away himself after three months
of it, but was brought back, charged with wife deser-
tion, and forced to resume the white man’s burden.
Then he fell down an abandoned shaft; but Jinny
and Jinny’s father, with the aid of a couple of
bridge-builders, got him up again. “No, you don’t. - ’
said old Wells. “Yiv got her, y’ill keep her.” ft
was at the Yarrup races. Jinny was one of a picnic
party camped at the Deep Hole north of the course.
When dipping for a billy of water out on the log-
jetty Jinny fell in. The picnic party gathered on
the bank and watched developments. Tom Honor
was to the fore, but making no further advances.
Jinny Honor was struggling wildly out in the wet.
Cameron arrived. Cameron threw off bis coat. He
threw off his boots. He was in the act of plunging

prevent her.” But Cameron helped her out. Tom

“Rag” : “R.b;h.” (B. U/2/’ly) ' says «
friend of his found “28 partially-developed reptiles”
sin. or kin. long in a lady tiger-snake’s interior:
and lie proceeds to hurl scorn at “the fallacy that
snakes are hatched from eggs.” Well, despite his
arguments, the egg theory is quite an incontroverti-
ble fact. The eggs vary in size, and have a tough
skin. Each contains a tiny but complete wriggler,
and there may be two- or three-score in a. “clutch.”
If anything frightens the family Ma simply opens
her eating arcade and swallows her infants til! the
danger passes. Cat-fish — freshwater —iuso use their
mouths as a sanctuary for their progeny. All forms
of lizards, snakes and amphibious saurian* are egg-
layers.
"Grenada” : I’ve been having some of the
silence and solitude of the Australian bush lately.
The magpies had, properly organised- concert and
dramatic parties—mostly dramatic. The kookaburras
held surprise partii
dents they could find. A few -abom
13,000 of them —debated the wheat question. One
debate became so warm that all the members of the
Assembly were yelling- at onCe, and throwing chairs
and gum-leaves at each other. In an ugly
old withered carcase of a tree I saw a crowd
of white cockatoos holding a revival meeting.
The audience was very interested in the chap
in the pulpit, but when I passed they all
jumped up and started to screech, “Kaiser!
Kaiser! Kaiser!” at the top of their voices.
Later on I camped, and while the billy was
boiling a couple of
leatherheads paid a
visit and criticised my
method of making a
fire. Their remarks
were so pointed that
I had to ask them to
leave. Meanwhile,
about 270 bell-birds
were disturbed at my
intrusion, and I had to
hurl at them apologies
and anything else
handy before they’d
clear out. No sooner
had they gone than I
saw a pee Wee and his
missus watching a
poor hawk sailing along
quite peaceably. The old
man peewee yelled: “Kill
him ! ” His missus shrieked:
“Not yet! ” They kept
this yelling up for a while,
and then started for the
hawk full tilt. The last
I saw of that inoffensive
feathered citizen he was
scratching his way through
a pile of clouds. Here-
abouts the silence was
broken and the solitude
interrupted by a few galahs
singing, “It’s a long way
to Tipperary,” and cheer-
ing on a fight between two
regiments of rosellas. I
could have wept for this
weirdly melancholy place
if I had had time, but just
then there was a snake
that required, urgent attention, and after that it was
time for bunk. Two hundreds frogs sang me to
sleep.
“Pick”: I want to drop upon the old
theory that trout never travel downstream. At
Mulwala, on the Murray, the other week, a trout
was captured that had attached to his lip, by a
split ring, a brass disc with certain numbers thereon
engraved. Inquiries at the N.S.W. Fisheries Depart-
ment led to the identification of the fish. He had
been liberated in the ’Bidgee near Cooma two years
before, and had traversed pretty nearly the whole
length of that trickle and a fair stretch of the
Murray before meeting with the business end of a
rod and line.

‘•Kola” : While hawking in Far Western
Riverina (N.S.W.) I knocked at the door of a very
lonely house. There were voices inside, but as no
one answered I pushed the door open. On the floor
sat three gins and a white woman, consuming tea
and cake. The white explained that she hadn’t
spoken to a woman for four years, and when the
gins wandered along they were to her as welcome as
angels. “When they go,” she added, “God only
knows when I’ll meet another! I struck another
woman who’d seen none of her sex for five years.
This poor exile, living on an out-station, had three
children. Not one of them had ever seen another
kid. At a wedding where I was welcomed the bride,
a really nice girl, had lived all her life outback.
She had never seen a train or a ship, nor a larger
town than Balranald. The husband, a cook, confi-
dentially informed me that he meant to talss her
to Melbourne and give her the surprise of her life.
Two years later I struck them at Pooncarie, on the
Darling. They’d got no farther. The maid was
happy in her own way. “We see some boats here
in the wool time,” she explained; “and lots of
shearers come.” So they did, God help her simple
soul. The husband still cherished the idea of “Goin’
ter Melbourne.” But they haven’t been there yet,
and Nelly has three chicks now.

“Iv.” : Here in Western Victoria the war
is very popular among the rabbits. In July skins
were over Is. per lb. Two days after the outbreak
of slaughter prices ran down to 4 Id., and all the
trappers and their mates were striking camp and
looking for another job. Bunny, relieved from the
strenuous life, jumped at the chance of enjoying
himself—organised picnics and bridge parties, and
went a-calling in the evenings. Mrs. B. also got
busy; and as she can do a lot in six months, to-day
her tribe swarms in thousands along every creek in
the district. The inspectors and farmers are going-
mad, for though quotations have gone up a bit the
figure doesn’t coax the hunters into the field. I
walked over a paddock lately that formerly held
only a few hares. It had become an immense
warren, and all the inhabitants expressed the most
friendly feelings for Kaiser Bill.
* ■* -* *
“Outcast”: Recently I saw a more
elaborate method of making fire by means of a flexible
sawing thong than, that mentioned by “Lagani-
Namo” (B. 12/11/’l4). It was up in the main
range of Papua. Five men helped to do the trick.
The usual softwood, split at one end and kept apart
by a pebble, and the usual tinder of tappa cloth
were in evidence, but the stick was kept in position
by three men holding it firmly on their shoulders.
The remaining two seized the ends of the strip of
splitcane and sawed vigorously. It took exactly 15
seconds to produce a smoulder in the tinder. Elab-
orate methods are' in use just north of Finsch-hafen
(Papua). The cleft softwood stick is bound firmly
to a housepost in a horizontal position, and a rattan
strip is drawn rapidly to and fro. across -it by two
men. one on each side of the stick. Time taken,
something under 50 seconds. Another tribe of the
same district lashes the cleft stick to two other long-
sticks so as to form a tripod. Dry grass or bast is
lodged in the cleft, and two men saw a rattan thong
across the cleft over the tinder. In order to have a
ready suppply of cane strips for fire-making, most
of the mountain Papuans wear armlets of coiled
cane, thus combining the useful with the ornamental.

“Paddy Melon” : Only saw one of the
female sex in charge of stock once. That was a
couple of years ago, away back on the telegraph line
in S. Aus. Further, all the hands were women. There
were two whites —sisters —one of whom was the boss.
The rest were gins. They brought a mob of sheep
from the other side of Oodnadatta to a spot some
four-hundred-odd miles down the line, and delivered
satisfactorily. The white women were sole owners.
Of course, the whole crowd of them rode astride, and
the gins were decked out in varied costumes, ranging
from a shirt collar to a pair of Darwin tweeds.

The wide-horned leaders pass with startled eyes ;
The mob. close-packed beneath a drift of dust,
With many a nervous tossing head upthrust,
Surges toward the summit of the rise.
The tawny nostrils pricked by odors strange
Quiver uneasily. They pause. . . .or plunge,
Shouldering the press with many a sudden lunge ;
And ever yearning for the distant range —-
For fenceless acres sweetened by the wind,
Swept by the shadow of a sailing cloud
That, dream-like, races o'er the treetops bowed- —
Break away obstinate, unheeding, blind-.
They reach (he river that ’twixt hill and plain
Flashes for ever like a severing sword,
Drink at the sun-laced shallows of the ford,
And, splashing deeper, stoop to drink again.
A stockwhip cracks. The weary stragglers pass
Hunched to a trot with sullen, hanging heads;
Above the distant moving browns and reds
The beat haze shimmers like a web of glass.
The high-pitched clamor of the dogs, the shout,
The sharp whip-crack, the bellowing drowning all,
In distant eddying echoes fainter fall
And die into the silence that they flout.
The muddied pools grow clear. The high sun spills
In green recesses many a golden stream,
A swallow flashes by with sapphire gleam,
And noontide sleeps upon the purple hills.

A HAPPY BALD-HEADED
MAN.
Well-known Politician Nearly Bald Now
Has New Growth of Hair.
Tells How He Did It.
A certain politician, well-known on
account of liis baldness and ready wit, sur-
prised his friends by appearing with a new
growth of hair. Many of his old friends
did not know him and others thought lie
had a wig. On being asked how he did it,
he made the following statement: “I attri-
bute the remarkable growth of my hair to
the use of the following simple recipe which
any lady or gentleman can mix at home.
To a half pint of water add loz. of bay rum,
a small box of Orlex Compound and Joz. of
glycerine. Apply to the scalp two or three
times a week with the finger tips. It not
only promotes the growth of the hair but
removes dandruff, scalp humours and pre-
vents the hair from falling out. It darkens
streaked, faded, grey hair and makes the
hair soft and glossy. These ingredients
can be purchased at any chemists at very
little cost and mixed at home,”*

PEBECO
Tooth Paste.
There are sermons in stones —
also in teeth. We’ll choose the
latter for our text.
But if everyone used Pebeco
Tooth Paste there would be no
further need of sermons, preach-
ments or parables on the proper
care of the teeth.
Pebeco Tooth Paste solves the
problem by ridding the mouth of
the enamel-destroying acids. “Acid
Mouth” is the dreaded thief which
experts now agree is the cause of
95% of all tooth decay. Pebeco

“Rag”: “Paddy Melon’s” description of
the Birdsville horse malady convinces me that it is
identical with the ailment which kills the camels
and other cattle in the Esperance-Norseman (W.A.)
tract. The cause in those parts is a shrub with an
elongated, heart-shaped leaf, which beasts devour as
matinee girls devour chocolates. In the outfit I was
attached to, our camels, hobbled short (two links),
sometimes jumped 15 miles to the poison over-
night. On one occasion six beasts contrived to
evade us for two “sun ups.” When we located
them they were corpses. Has anyone ever thought
of forwarding these poisonous plants to an accredited
analyst? An investigation might result in the dis-
covery of a sjmple and effective antidote, and thereby
save hundreds of animals that Australia should not
lose.

THE SACRIFICE.
DOCTOR : “Look here, old chap, it's no use.
You'll have to cut this wine, woman and
song business."
P ATIENT: “ Doctor, if you will have it so, I
give up — song!"
“Lonesome” : For painstaking care in ship-
building the natives of the Kingwill group take beat-
ing. No large timber being available, small flakes
are stitched together, mostly with human hair. These
precious canoes are capable of carrying from 40 to
50 persons. I once saw one making heavy weather
with a native sitting On the prow to act as a weather-
cloth.
ANCIENT HISTORY.
DOSSER : “I renumber when I tester work at ”
SNORKY : “Aw, givus somethin’ noo.”
“Boronia” : Is there any naturalist handy
who can oblige me with information concerning a
very unpleasant fish known in most Australian
waters as a “cobbler” ? About a fortnight ago my
best girl and I were paddling along the magnificent
beach at Busselton (W.A.), when she suddenly
lurched forward, declaring that something had stung
her foot and that the pain was awful. I had a
mighty big contract to get her back to town, and
for 12 solid hours she suffered intense agony, which
could be slightly eased only by keeping the foot in
hot water. All the information available was that
(1) she had trod on a cobbler, that (2) this fish
lurks on the beach just under the water, after dark,
and that (3) the racking pain usually lasts 24 hours.

“Vigilans”: “Paddy Melon’s” story (B.
11/2/’l5) of the emu that was used as a beast of
burden reminds me of Dick Stewart, manager of
Mitchell Down station (Q.). In the drought time of
1900-2 he trained two of the birds to drag a rick-
shaw which he had imported from Hongkong. Ash-
ton Murphy, The Bulletin artist of the Outback,
sketched Stewart driving his team tandem. Inci-
dentally, emus are having a torrid time along the
Murray. The country is in a terrible state for want
of water. Travelling between Hay and Euston
recently, I came across numbers of dead emus and
greater numbers of walking skeletons. These latter
crawled to us in camp and devoured anything we
could offer them. When we trekked they followed
us for miles. The conditions of bird life, along that
track are heartrending.

Maoriland has an idea that its West
Coast is just about the most drowned spot in the
world, and it says “Hey, mon!” in astonishment at
Boss’s 128.54 in. last year and its 22.76 in. in the one
month of November. But there are plenty of places
which reckon the Maoriland West Coast a place
where there’s no real use for an umbrella. All along
between the Johnstone and Russell rivers, in Queens-
land, the average isn’t less than 150 in., and Goondi
has had 200 in. so often that it doesn’t mention the
circumstance. As for Ross’s 22.76 in. in a month,
Harvey Creek, which is up in the part of Australia
that really is.wet, had a shower on January 3, 1911,
and registered 27,75 in. for the 24 hours — hours, not
days. But even that isn’t a record, for Kuranda,
where the Northerners go to get out of the coastaj
moisture, had 28.80 in. on April 2, 1911, and there
was a drizzle of 24in. the day before.

“Ananias Walton”: Sydney Sun repro-
duced a couple of Alec Hurley’s N.T. photographs
lately, and announced that these represented a croco-
dile and an alligator respectively. For the 112th
time, let it be stated there are no alligators on the
Australian continent, nor, indeed, anywhere outside
the two Americas. The “alligator” of the Sun is
the true crocodile, so common north of the tropic of
Capricorn. The “crocodile” of the photograph re-
ferred to is a gavial, a member of the crocodile
family conspicuous for his long and slender jaws
and the fact that he is an eater of live fish, and
not any old thing, living or dead, as his aldermanic
cousin is. Like the crocodiles, the gavials are
found in Asiatic as well as in Australian waters,
and are freshwater to a saurian. Old “croc.,” on the
other hand, mixes his drinks.
“E.V.C.”: The Germans will do well to
keep their travelling kitchens beyond smelling dis-
tance of the hard-case bush Australians. Some time
ago I wandered into a navvies’ mess-room where a
meal could be bought for a bob. Fifty professionals
were waiting dinner. When' the food was ready they
rounded up before a window through which the cook
passed; the grub. As each man emerged from the
riot he grabbed the necessary implements, a hand-
ful of sliced bread and a pint which he dipped into
a kerosene-tin of tea. Behind the window the chef’s,
assistants 1 were too hurried to use spoons. They
handed out spuds and cabbage in the same way as
bricks. My share was enough to keep me going for
a week. My neighbor had as much, yet when he
finished his first course he was undecided whether
to take a second lot or a double dose of duiff. He
decided on the two duffs, and for a. start got a piece
as large as the steamed pudding shared by 10
suburban boarders. A fair number of that crowd
are now in Egypt. If the strength of an army is
‘the strength of its stomach, I’ll back our lot to
march from Suez to Berlin without a break.
MOST UNCOURTEOUS.
THE LIDY (who has been biffed by the gentle-
man): “ And do you call yourself a gentle,
man to do THAT to a lady?"
“J. J.C.”: Talking about Empire-builders
and jerry-builders, will somebody instruct me how -to
become a good damper-builder? As far as I can
see, making damper is a gamble. I’ve sampled the
confectionery from Darwin to Haddon Corner and
back again, and the texture, taste and variety of
the goods are legion. Some makers bewail the lack
of gidya ashes as the reason of their non-success,
but that particular brand of ash never made any
difference to my cooking. City bakers are requested
not to put their oar in. This is out of their class.
“Wandi” Many wild-bird notes make a
deep and lasting impression. There is a peculiar
charm in the call of the mopoke, and to me
nothing brings back memories of the long ago
like that haunting note. It is not because it is
among my earliest recollections of bushland, for
scores of other notes —the warbling of the magpie
and the sweet song of the butcher bird—were just
as familiaryet they affect me little more than
the quark of the übiquitous crow or the shrill cry
of the kite hawk, so often in one’s ears when one
is battling with a bush Are. The ardent Billjim who
is in the habit of stealing meetings with his sweet-
heart at the sliprails, or in the clump of wattle by
the creek, imitates the call of the mopoke to announce
that he has arrived. I adopted this plan once—only
once—‘when I was about 17. I mopoked under a big
peach tree at the back of her house. Unfortunately,
the old man was watching thereabouts for a flying
fox.. He let his: gun off close behind me, and said,
“Dang your eyes!”' He may have said more;' I was
too busy falling over' the woodheap to follow the
trend of his remarks. I lost a very good pipe that
time too. I saw the farmer smoking it afterwards
in town, but I did not ask him where he got it. I
had bought another pipe by that time, so it didn’t
matter. There is a haunting melody, also, in the
note of the bilbong, or bell bird, heard along the
ranges, tinkling all around from the tree tops like a
thousand silver bells. It is somewhat ventriloquial,
like the chirp of the cricket. One experiences much
difficulty in locating the small, dark-crested, reddish-
brown birds even in the clearer spaces. The wonga
pigeon is another of the many sweet-voiced birds
of the deep scrubs, and its long, liquid note can be
heard many miles. There also the voice of the
wit-e-chu and the sharp, bursting noise of the whip-
bird attract attention. In the same lushy shadowland
the infant-like cry of the cat bird, the creaky whistle
of the drongo, the sibilant, yet powerful, call of
the lyre bird, and the soft, cheery hail of the rifle
bird, impress themselves on the ear. The rifle bird,
which is a member of the gorgeous bird of paradise
family, runs up and down tree-trunks in its scrubby
home, digging out grubs with its long bill. Its
plumage is velvety black, set off with brilliant
satiny green. The catbird’s cry is one of the most
arresting in the brushes. The first time I heard it I
searched a dense scrub for two hours looking for a
strayed baby.

“Retlaw”: The big drought in the
Murray watershed has caused the river to shrink so
much that Wentworth’s water-supply, which is
pumped from the river, threatened to peter out. The
inhabitants of the average up-country town would
have met the emergency by hurling a few deputations
at the head of the Government, but the Wentworth
people, real outbackers, are more self-reliant. They
looked up the district Works officer, and he told
them that if labor and material were forthcoming he
would guarantee to build a dam that would hold up
sufficient water to keep the pump going. The rush
to take him at his word shook the oldest inhabitant
to the foundation of his reminiscences. It was the
most energetic working bee ever seen in the West,
and the dam was completed in a day.

“Vigilans”: Re tannin extract, which
“8.J.H.0.” (B. 28/1 /’l5) says Australian tanners
in the past have imported from Germany. Little or
nothing is known in Australia of the astringent
qualities of bloodwood and mangrove bark. In
West Kimberley mangrove bark is collected along
the coast from Broome to Derby, and exported to
the so-called East. The red mangrove makes an
excellent tannin. On the stations kangaroo skins
have been tanned with it and made up into stock-
whips. During one wet season in the Northern Terri-
tory we tried experiments in tanning hides of all
sorts. Those conducted with bloodwood bark were
very successful. Goat skins and ’roo pelts turned
out best. One goat-skin which I tanned, with the
hair on, I used for a saddle-cloth on the long ride
from Pine Creek to Queensland. I used nothing else
during the 1200-mile journey, yet it never became
hard or crinkly. People who admired it were sur-
prised when I told them how it was tanned. The
overseer at one ranch wanted to buy it for a mat.
I have also tanned bullock hide with bloodwood bark,
and made chair seats out of the leather, which was
beautifully soft. I have also soled boots with it. Now,
there should be an unlimited supply of bloodwood
in Australia, while all the north coast, Kimberley
and North Queensland are fringed with mangroves.
GIRDLES OF GUMLEAVES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They make them girdles of gumleaves, the lands of
the North and the West.
When they learn that with like leaf-raiment the lady
Australia’s drest;
They take of the lady’s largesse, for girdle, for stole,
for gown;
Garlands they make of gumleaves, to border a pat-
terned town.
Fair California seeks them, sending across the main,
To charm with new dress new lovers, as she charmed
with the old one Spain ;
Mexico gathers them round her, to flirt with her
last buccaneer ;
Chili arranges them quaintly, grouping them far
and near.
Not only Americanas, ladies of South and North,
Love for their garments gumleaves, and far for the
trees send forth:
They blend with the ancient beauty to border the
robes of Rome,
And on the archaic shoulders of Palestine find new
home.
Gumleaves wherever we wander, their scent and their
memories,
But half the charm’s in Australia, the charm of
Australia’s trees ;
Italy, France and Egypt may lure where the gum-
trees stand,
But girdles, and garlands of gumleaves glad most in
the gumleaf’s land.

PRACTICAL PRESCRIPTION AGAINST
STOMACH ACIDITY.
BY A SPECIALIST.
“Nine-tenths of all cases of stomach
trouble nowadays,” says a leading specialist,
“are caused by too much acid. In tlie begin-
ning the stomach itself is not diseased, but
if this acid condition is allowed to continue,
the acid is very likely to eat into the stomach
walls and produce stomach ulcer or cancer,
either of which may render a radical sur-
gical operation necessary, even to prolong
life. Therefore an ‘acid stomach’ is really a
dangerous condition, and should be treated
seriously. It is utterly useless to take
pepsin and ordinary stomach tablets. The
excess acid must be neutralised by the ad-
ministration of an efficient antacid. For
this purpose physicians nearly always recom-
mend taking half a teaspoonful of bisurated
magnesia in a little water after each meal.
Large quantities may be used if necessary,
as it is absolutely harmless. But be sure
to get the bisurated magnesia, as other
forms of magnesia have not the same action
in the stomach as the bisurated, and fre-
quently do more harm than good.”*
PERSONAL
ITEMS
In Melbourne the other day a young man
on an old-fashioned wooden leg presented
himself for enlistment. lie wanted to have
a cut at the Germans, he said, and when
opposed by authority he got irritable, and
offered to run the fat officer who barred his
way over a distance of half a mile for any
sum up to £5. Told that his misfortune
incapacitated him beyond a hope, he grew
more furious, and undertook to fight any of
the three stout personages in sight. “Gimme
a barrel' iv ’arf bricks,” he said, “an’ I'll
take on any six iv yer German pris’ners
’ere an’ now. Not fit!” he wailed. “Me
not fit? Gorstrnth! ’n’ I’ve just come out
for knockin’ a .John.” Which recalls the
fact that a few years back the Crutchy Push,
a collection of cripples, was one of the most
formidable larrikin gangs the Melbourne
police had to deal with.
SENA TOR
GARDINER,
Vice-Fresident
of the Federal
Executive
Council.
Joseph Bidincape, who was credited with
being the first man to build hats in Aus-
tralia, uncovered his head for the last time
the other day at Hobart. ITis first work-
shop was in, Ilampton-road. The place is
now a malthouse. An enlarged hattery was
afterwards opened at the present building in
Murray-street. The old man-—he was 78—
had lived in Hobart for over 50 years, and
hailed originallv from Poland. Hard work
built up a large, prosperous business, and
when not making hats he grew roses and
chrysanthemums. The Bidincape garden, at
Cottage Green, is part of that Cottage Green
once owned by Bobby Ivnopwood, the sport-
ing horticulturally-minded chaplain, who had
charge of the local morals in the settlement
days. The potting-house, where the happy
old parson used to transplant, treasured seed-
lings grown from stones and pips sent out
from “Home,” still stands.
No use dodging your luck. If it is wait-
ing for you it will get you. George Cleggett,
who has a reputation all over South Aus. as
a horseman and show-ring judge of horses,
has dislocated his right arm at the shoulder.
Guess how he did it. While cracking a
whip!
George Black, just made Minister of Agri-
culture in N. S. Wales, has had to wait a
long while to get Cabinet rank. Yet at the
start, in 1891, no member looked surer of
early promotion. It was he who was chosen
to make the party’s first policy speech in the
Assembly, and before that he had proposed
what was for years called the solidarity
pledge. But obstacles always seemed to fall in
Black’s way; and when they didn’t fall lie
pushed them. In the successful party poli-
tician’s make-up there must be more oil than
acid; and it isn’t Black’s fault that in his
there has always been more acid than oil.
Of the 36 people who called themselves Labor
members after the 1891 general election only
three besides Black are still in the Assembly
—McGowen, Cann and Edden. Joe Cook
and Gardiner have gone on to Federal poli-
tics. Of the remaining 30 about half are
dead and half have found peace some other
wav.
“F.L. J.” on the up-ending of things: —
The other night, in the Houee of Commons,
somebody called out “God save Ireland!” and
John Redmond replied with “God save England!”
Ten years ago that pious prayer for the Sassenach
would have lost Redmond his seat in the House,
not to speak of his leadership of the Irish Party.
Here in Australia it is the same. M. B. Higgins
and Charles Gavan Duffy, two Melbourne barristers
and sons of Irish Nationalists, have stopped taking
briefs and are going to the war with British troops,
formerly well hated in Ireland. Higgins is son of
Justice Higgins, who, before he became a Judge,
was among the orators whenever Irish grievances
were to be ventilated. Duffy is son of Justice
Frank Gavan Duffy, also of the High Court, and
grandson of Charles Gavan Duffy, tried in Dublin
in 1844 for what may be roughly called high
treason: “For unlawfully and seditiously con-
spiring to raise and create discontent and dis-
affection amongst the Queen's subjects and to excite
such subjects to hatred and contempt of, and to
unlawful and seditious opposition to, the Govern-
ment and Constitution.” Now, here we have his
grandson in Australia, where he himself was once
Premier of Victoria, laying down his bar-briefs
and taking up the sword to do battle for the Eng-
land that the old man was said to have so hated.
Young Higgins and young Duffy have both got
commissions as military officers. Five other Mel-
bourne barristers have left chambers to go to “the
front,” in addition to about a dozen attorneys.
Brigadier-General R. 11. Davies, C. 8., the
Taranaki (M.L.) surveyor who lias just
been made a major-general in the British
Army, has had a meteoric career. He first
saw active service in the Boer War with the
First Maoriland Contingent, and finished up
in S’Africa in temporary charge of a brigade
-—-the only “colonial” to achieve the honor.
Returning to M.L. he fell foul of louseph
Ward’s military-political ideas, and left for
Aldershot, where very soon he was again
in charge of a brigade, which subsequently
formed a portion of Sir Douglas Haig’s First
Army Corps in the British Expeditionary
Army. Davies was mentioned in French’s
despatches of September 7. During the great
scrap of 25 days, from Mons to the Seine
and then back to the Marne and the Aisne,
he was forced to give up owing to an influ-
enza attack, which developed into severe
pneumonia, and for days his life was in the
greatest danger. In a letter at the time to
Davies’s family, General Haig remarked
that the sick man’s life was too valuable to
be lost, and the King paid a visit to the
Maorilander, invalided temporarily in the
South of England.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” samples some
early brews :
But for the gold discoveries of 1851 the fortune of
the Tooths would most likely have been quite small.
In the ’4o’s their beer-factory was a very modest
affair indeed. There were then eight alleged brewers
in Sydney: Blaxland Brothers, who were in Clarence-
street, between King and Market streets; Thos.
Cadell, who brewed at Windsor and sold at No. 1
Bridge-street; D’Arcy Burton, Ultimo House; Hughes
and Co., very much on the wane, where the Tooheys
are now; J. T. Turnbull, the Adelaide Brewery,
George-street; Robert Thompson, Darlinghurst way;
Tooth, Parramatta-street; and James Wright, the
oldest of them all, on the corner of George and
Bathurst streets. Tooth was the survivor of this
lot in 1853, when the fire at his brewery occurred.
During the re-building, by the way, Sydney’s first
important eight-hour strike occurred. The con-
tractor after a while gave in. Nehemiah Bartley
says: “Business was brisk then (1851-3). I remem-
ber that Robert Tooth, finding that the scarcity of
copper change in Sydney seriously affected the con-
sumption of ale, offered £lO,OOO for £5OOO worth
of copper, if landed in Sydney by a certain date.”
History does not say that the copper came out, but
the necessity for coins brought the “token,” and
amongst the issues were some by publicans. Alf
Toogood (The Rainbow) and Ben Palmer (Liverpool
Arms), both at the intersection of King and Pitt
streets, issued them. They were made in Birming-
ham generally, and cost 12s. 6d. for every 20s. worth
landed in Sydney.
Delfosse Badgery, the Australian aviator,
of Sutton Forest (N.S.W.), comes of a
family of pioneers. James Badgery, the first
of the clan, arrived in Sydney in 1798. He
at once went on to the land, obtaining grants
at the head of South Creek, near Liverpool
—the creek there is still known as Bad-
gery’s. He took a very prominent part in
inducing Major Johnston to arrest Governor
Bligh in 1808. His eldest son. Henry, was
one of the first to push out into the newly-
explored Bong Bong district, where he
secured fine country at Exeter, near Sutton
Forest. There he reared a large family of
sons, who in their turn were always in the
forefront of those looking for new country.
A WARNING FROM THE UNITED STAVES.
WOOD-NOT-ROW WILSON : “If you sink too many of my ships I'll—I'll”
W ILHELM: “Veil, vat vill you do?. Gif me a hiding."
W.W.: “No; but I'll become very distant in my manner, and won't remember your
next birthday! ”
Two of them have been in Parliament- —
H. S. Badgery, who represented East Mait-
land in the 9tli Parliament and Monaro
in the 10th and 11th Parliaments, and was
Secretary for Public Works in George Hibbs’s
short-lived Government in 1885; and Frank
A., who at present represents his native
constituency of Wollondilly.
Monsignor Byrne, the oldest R.C. digni-
tary in South Aus., celebrated his 81st birth-
day last week. He was appointed Vicar-
General of the Diocese of Adelaide 42 years
ago by his old chum, the late Archbishop
Christopher Reynolds. He is the historian
of the diocese and a vigorous and active old
man for his age.
“Melb” : Adela Pankhurst is making good
as Vida Goldstein’s first lieutenant in our
Victorian social movement, and indeed is
more to the fore than Vida. When Adela
came she was regarded as a simple young
thing, quite overshadowed by mother and
Sylvy and Christabel. Now we suspect she
is the most brainy of the lot. She seems
to have pitched permanently in this city, and
isn’t afraid to go on original lines. Thus
her present grievance is that fashionable
Society women are taking bread out of the
mouths of poor needlewomen by doing all
kinds of sewing for the soldiers. Vida’s
second lieutenant is Cecilia John, who is
coming rapidly forward. She is principal
contralto of Collins-street Independent
Church and was in Musgrove’s German
Opera Company—one of the Valkyrie
Maidens.
Captain Oswald Watt, a native of Sydney,
who has received the French Legion of. Honor
for services as an airman in the war, comes
of old Australian stock. His father, the late
John Brown Watt, M.L.G.. reached Sydney
in 1842 as a young man of 18 from Edin-
burgh, and entered the office of his uncle,
John Gilchrist, who had established himself
as a merchant in 1828. Eventually* J„ B.
Watt became head of this firm, known as
Gilchrist. Watt aud Co. His wife—Oswald
Watt's mother —-was a daughter of George
Kenyon Holden, who came to Australia on
the staff of Governor Sir Richard Bourke in
1831. In 1833 he was admitted as a solici-
tor, and practised for many years in partner-
ship with William Godfrey McCarthy, till
the advent of Torrens Act, when he was
made Examiner of Titles. He was one of
the first batch of life members of the Legis-
lative Council appointed in 1861, but re-
signed in 1863. Captain Oswald Watt, who
was born in 1878, had his training as an
airman in the Military Aviation Corps at
Aldershot. He was captain in the Scottish
Rifles in Sydney.
“F.L.J.” talks about Melbourne detectives:
Things have changed since 30 years agone, when
I used to do the “rounds” for my paper. The very
name has been blotted out, and the old Detective
Office is the new Criminal Investigation Department.
In those days, Tom O’Callaghan was an “ordinary”
detective—intelligent, cute, and, let me say, cour-
teous and good-looking. Then he went on to Ben-
digo as inspector, and Mahoney and Sainsbury
worked with him on the detective side. Now
O’Callaghan is retired from the service on a neat
pension, and, every day, sits on the Magistrates’
Bench at Melbourne City Court. The witness-box
used to be his place in the old days. When
O’Callaghan was made Chief he was Inspeeting-
Superintendent. Milne afterwards took that place.
Now, Milne has reached the age limit and is going
to retire. Sainsbury, of course, followed his old
Bendigo senior as Chief Commissioner. Gleeson,
who now has charge of the Detective Office, is to
succeed Milne, and Macmanamy will have charge of
“the office” and its ramifications. Hartshorn and
Costello (with the accent on the “s,” not on the
“1”), both inspectors, will retire from the ser-
vice ; and that gives an opening for a couple of
other young fellows. And times have changed in
that matter of promotion, too. In the days of
Captain Standish, the old army officer who was con-
nected with the Irish nobility, only a “gentleman”
brought in from outside could be even a sub-
inspector.
THE LITTLE HERO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Germany fears a food famine. The authorities are
inducing school children to renounce sausages and
meat and to take to school only a few slices of
bread. — Cable.
The little hero stood his ground,
And waved the tempting chop aside;
He felt in honor he was bound
The steaming cutlet to deride —-
To please his Kaiser he’d not eat
A trace of any kind of meat.
He bade the sausage fat avaunt;
He turned his nose up at the steak.
No anguish could his spirit daunt,
No matter what the boil or bake.
In grim defiance, too, of roast
He stayed himself on bread and toast.
Soon with the .passing of the meat
And kraut and spuds both boiled and fried,
There came a dangerous dearth of wheat—
And then the little hero died.
And Kaiser Bill with rapture gave
An Iron Cross to deck his grave !
Victoria.

for 1914.
You don’t often dip into this society’s
annual report without finding an improve-
ment somewhere. Three or four years ago
the management decided to do a quite legiti-
mate thing—in fact, a desirable thing—and
show on the expenditure side the cash bonus
declared as for the previous year, and on the
receipts side the amount undrawn and rein-
A'ested with the society. There was only
one flaiv: the amount reinvested w r asn’t
separated from the other single-premium
business. This year the flaw is removed ; of
the £207.565 of income £26,070 is shown as
“cash bonus applied to purchase of rever-
sionary bonuses” —or, dropping the language
of the shop, bonuses used in buying new
paid-up insurance.
Now, that is a thing that is w r ell worth
starring on every successful co.’s accounts.
In fact, it ought to be obligatory on an in-
surance co.’s part to show’ plainly (1) the
bonus used in buying new business, and (2)
the part taken in cash. In this case the
figures make it clear that, whereas during
1913 the premiums paid amounted to
£121,398 (excluding, perhaps, a trifle of
single-premiums paid in cash), the cash re-
turned by the society and used in purchas-
ing paid insurance for the policy-holders
was £26,979, or just on 23 p.c. This is an
astonishingly good performance, and all the
better because the premium rates are not
higher than those of most offices. It really
means that, though the society reckoned it
would cost you £4 to buy a certain amount
of insurance, it finds it could provide that
much last year for £3; so it returns you the
other £1 in the shape of extra insurance—•
or cash if you w r ould be foolish enough to
take it that way.
For its highly satisfactory bonus achieve-
ments the City Mutual has to thank its
handy size. You hear the weak co. yell-
ing at the top of its voice that, though it
has but just started, it is going to get half-
a-million of business this year. It would
be far better for those policy-holders whom
it did get if it wrote only £lOO,OOO of busi-
ness ; for, while it might get that much at a
cost of 80 p.c. of the first-year premiums,
the chances are it will cost 180 p.c. to write
the other £400.000. Every office can get a
certain number of policies at a reasonable
[trice: it is the policies w’ritten beyond that
certain number that cost the extravagant
money. The City Mutual has deliberately
adopted the policy of aiming at an amount
of new business well within its power. Its
exes, are therefore very moderate. Assum-
ing as usual that the renewal (old) busi-
ness cost 7 p.c. and that that covered also
the investment of accumulated funds, then
the new' business cost-rate was only
S 3 p.c. of the first-year premiums. And
it was certainly less than that, be-
cause the old business, including the
investment of funds, etc., w'as not done
in this case for 7 p.c. For this
society invests its funds in a way of its
own, putting the money out on loans, etc.,
that require a lot of attention. Included
in the assets are, for example, “stocks and
shares in public cos., £28,382.” The result
last year was an interest rate averaging
£5 15s. 6d. p.c. plus £7500 of profit on
investments—presumably on actual pur-
chases and sales, though that point ought
to be made clearer. This £7500 is very
wisely written off to a contingency reserve,
which now amounts to £27,500. This policy
of investment throw's a great responsibility
on the management: just as a few good
strokes make profit and consequently
bonuses, a few bad ones might involve
heavy losses. But, after all. it is a com-
paratively small amount with which the
management takes risks. Of the total of
£771.351 of assets, £661,445, or 86 p.c. of
the lot. is in Government stock, mortgages,
loans and policies, and freeholds and lease-
holds, and those are lines that the most
rule-of-thumb office in Australia doesn't shy
at.
On one other point this healthy society
deserves a further word or two of encour-
agement. Says the directors’ report: “As
some evidence of the growing popularity of
the w T hole-life policies—the true embodiment
of life assurance—it is interesting to note
that, w’hile 329 policies under this table,
assuring £85,350. w'ere issued tw’o years ago.
the figures for last year were 706 policies’
covering £197.400.” Whole-life policies at
present are the hardest to get, and. com-
pared with endowment policies, cost a bigger
percentage of the first-year premium (the
annual premium being smaller) ; and in view
of the increase in their number the very
moderate expense rate is all the more satis-
factory.' In any case, and whatever the
result, the work of the society in popular-
ising the whole-life policy—a policy which
has been far too much neglected—deserves a
good word.

There has been mystery about this concern
for many years. In fact, there was mystery
about the scheme before the co. was formed.
People never knew (or pretended they
didn’t) how it was that the Bill submitted
to the N.S.W. Parliament got no for’arder
for month after month —indeed, year after
year—and then suddenly jumped right
through in about 24 hours. However, that
is ancient history of over 25 years ago.
The Act set out that, in consideration of
the right to lay mains, the co. should pay
the Sydney City Council half of any profits
divided in excess of 10 p.c. Presently it
looked as if the divisible profits would exceed
10 p.c.; so a cheerful little scheme was
arranged by which a pup co. was formed to
do the parent co.’s engineering work and
skim off the surplus profit. The pup paid
15 p.c., and didn’t have to divide with any-
body. After this Hydraulic Power Co. had
been in existence some years it began to
suffer from electric competition, and there
was vague talk of an amalgamation with
the Standard-Waygood Co., which had the
electric-lift business in its hands. However,
nothing came of that; but presently
Standard-Waygood „swallowed the Engineer-
ing Co. In other words, a co. interested in
pushing electric lifts took over the contract
for the inspection, repair, etc., of this co.’s
competing hydraulic lifts. There was
naturally a howl about that. James Angus,
one of the promoters and a director, backed
by Frank Grimley, another of the directors,
started to fight. Still, nothing tangible was
done, so the meeting the other day resolved
“that it be an instruction to the Board that
the co. shall in future undertake the inspec-
tion, maintenance and repair of hydraulic
lifts operated by the co.’s power.”
But that doesn’t make things satisfactory,
inasmuch as the administration of that reso-
lution is left in the hands of a Board
unfriendly to it. And that opens up another
story. The directors included Alfred Meeks
and Frank Grimley. The former, who had
for years been chairman* had been a director
of the Engineering Coi, too, and when that
co.’s business was swallowed by Standard-
Waygood, ho went on to Standard-Waygood
Board. Previously Mr. Angus (who had also
gone on the S.-W. Board) retired; Mr.
Meeks now also dropped out—the mud was
getting too thick. Mr. Grimley also
resigned, designing to contest one of the
two ordinary vacancies and knock out one
of the retiring men —Bruce Smith for choice.
The two retiring men nominated: so did
Grimley. But Smith (in the chair)
declared himself and his colleague Angus
re-elected for the ordinary vacancies, and
declared Grimley elected for one of the other
vacancies. The proceeding seems utterly
wrong. Further, Adrian Knox, K.C.. says
it was wrong. So far as that meeting knew,
there were no extraordinary vacancies. Two
directors had resigned, but there was no obli-
gation to fill their places. In any case, it
was for the directors to fill casual vacancies.
Grimley nominated against Bruce Smith and
Angus. And as Grimley was in the same
“stable” as Angus, his nomination was
really against Bruce Smith. Says Adrian
Knox:—
He was entitled to have his name put before the
meeting, and the meeting' should have been given
an opportunity to elect or reject him as one of the
directors in lieu of those retiring by rotation. This
right the chairman denied him, and this, in mv
opinion, invalidated the election of the other two.
The chairman, as already remarked, was
Bruce Smith. No doubt he declared him-
self re-elected from a sense of duty to the
co. But it is difficult to follow his reasoning.
Grimley at present declines to take the
seat to which the chairman has
declared him elected, so there are on the
Board Smith, Angus and Nicholson. The
last is one of the managers of the Standard-
Waygood. Notwithstanding the shareholders’
direction, the majority on the Board there-
fore favors the old, illogical and, on the face
of it, distinctly bad policy. If things were
going satisfactorily there might be nothing
to be said. That, anyhow, would suggest
that the arrangement was not prejudicing
the co. But something is prejudicing it.
For several years past The Bulletin has
compiled a comparison of the co.’s gross
revenue for corresponding half-years:—
1907 ..£12,161 | 1911 ~£12,129
1908 . . 12,352 1 1912 . . 12,089
1909 . . 11,429 ! 1913 . . 11,856
1910 .. 11,852 I 1914 .. 11,551
In view of the construction boom in Sydney
during the past seven years the co.’s revenue
should have increased by at least 33 p.c. It
has actually shrunk. There is something
very wrong somewhere. Years ago The
Bulletin declared that the Engineering Co.
should not have been floated. The trans-
action separated two operations which it
was not desirable to separate. The fusion
of Standard-Waygood and the Engineering
Co. made matters worse. The amalgama-
tion of the three cos. might, however, have
been wise. Even now amalgamation is
desirable from the shareholders’ point of
view, if not the public’s. If it were effected
the Hydraulic people would of course suffer
from the delay, for their shares are worth
much less than they were three years ago,
when amalgamation was first talked of.
But maybe the Standard-Waygood directors
don’t want to amalgamate. Not yet. at any
rate. In that case, the only thing to do is
to see that the shareholders’ recent direc-
tion is carried into effect.

The result of the Commonwealth Weather
Dispenser’s post-mortem of 1914 is just out,
and shows that the whole of the western
and practically all the northern parts of
Victoria have been through the driest year
on record. The badness has naturally been
reflected on the real property market. And
as though that was not enough, the Great
Collision happened, and the two have prac-
tically abolished property sales in Victoria.
The next table will show, among other
things, the extent of the trouble so far as
this bank is concerned:—

But that slump doesn’t affect the profits
credited to the bank; these profits from
sales are credited to a special reserve
created for a special purpose. As the note
at the head of the first table mentions, the
capital was written down from £909,979
to £198,935, following on a very extensive
writing-down of assets. This was in 1905,
just when Victoria was wondering if things
would ever recover after the bad set-back of
1903-4. As generally happens in wonder-
fully-recuperative Australia things did
recover, and the recovery was rapid. As
sales have been made at the higher prices,
the profits (Le., the amounts realised in
excess of the written-down values) have been
thrown into a special reserve for the benefit
of the deferred and ordinary shares. The
rate at which the slate has been cleaned,
as well as the vigor of the writing-down,
is shown by the fact that in 10 years this
reserve has reached £97,726. This amount,
of course, is not included in the first table.
However, the old property on hand now
stands at only a few thousands, so the
reserve has not got much more room to grow.
How the property and other items have
moved is shown here: —

The deposits are exceptionally well secured.
No less than £161.192 of the amount —say
60 p.c.—is held liquid. Against the balance
are the remaining assets —over £4 for every
£1 of the balance. If the advance business
were available there is no reason whatever
why the co. shouldn’t be trusted with
another quarter of a million for a start.
The trouble is the dog got a bad name years
back; and it has to be a member of the
Y.M.C.A. for a long, long while before its
old sins are forgotten. Wherefore neither
good borrowing nor good lending customers
turn into this office automatically. Later
oa things may improve, as they deserve to.

Note that the period covered is to the end of
June, so that the accounts were closed before
William started his rudeness. In view of
that, the figures are disappointing. Those
for 1013 were certainly inflated by £61,425
received on the cancellation of a contract
made with the Hydraulic Power and Smelt-
ing Co. Still a drop from £255:,000 in
£158.000 is a serious matter. The largest
trouble was the fall in the market value of
zinc. Here are the average prices for the
last three years, ending June 30 in each case:
1912. 1913. 1914.

Silver . . 2 4 2 61 2 5
Zinc . . 26 4 9 25 9 10* 21 2 6
The total output from the lead concentrating
mill was 1.181,0510 z. silver and 22,770 tons
lead; from the flotation plant, 20,797 tons
zinc, contained in 64,708 tons concentrates.
Assuming that the co. was paid for 20,000
tons of zinc, the fall in the market for that
metal would account for £87,000. The
movements in silver and lead about balanced
one another.
But there were other factors at work.
The output of ore from the Central mine at
Broken Hill was only 208,538 tons, against
211,593 tons in 1912-13, and 220,450 tons in
1911-12. In 1911-12 work was uninter-
rupted ; the next year it was broken into by
a strike on the railway, and last year by a
temporary failure of the water supply. Fur-
ther, the foreign charges for smelting were
advanced last year, with the result that a
larger quantity of concentrates was handled
at the co.’s own works at Cockle Creek, at
a somewhat higher price. Mining and mill
costs are also steadily climbing up. More
ore has naturally to be broken from the
deeper levels, and owing to the more inti-
mate association of the metals this feed has
to be finer crushed; The cost per ton of
lead concentrates in 1913 was £8 Is. 3d.:
for the past year, £8 6s. 7d. On the other
hand, the zinc (flotation) plant produced
concentrates (46 p.c. spelter) at a cost of
17s. Id., as against" 17s. 3d. the year before.
That is only the cost of taking the tailings
out of the surface dumps and treating them;
but even so it is an astonishingly small price
to pay for so valuable a product—and a
product, too, which was for years turned to
no account. Finally, income tax paid in
Australia and England last year was £22,154.
against £7660 in the previous term.
Metallurgieally the interesting feature of
the year was the starting of the slimes plant
in March. “The results,” the directors say.
“were quite satisfactory; but owing to the
necessity of drying the product before de-
livery, practically none of it had been
shipped before the war broke out, and the
past year therefore derived no benefit.” In
all, 20,804 tons of slimes were handled, and
the product was as follows ;
Quantity, Silver, Lead, Zinc,
tons. oz. p.c. p.c.
Lead concentrates . . 3960 45.2 47.9 22.0
Zinc „ . . 6140 18.5 16.1 39.0
It can’t be claimed that these are first-class
products. The lead concentrates, for in-
stance, are burdened with 22 p.c. zinc,
whereas the lead concentrates derived from
ore carry only 6.9 p.c. A lead concentrate
carrying more than 8 p.c. zinc is usually
penalised. Similarly, whereas the zinc-
concentrate from tailings carries only 8.3
p.c. lead, those from slimes carry 16.1 p.c.;
and that is no good either. However, the
manager reports that, until the plant closed
down owing to cancellation of contracts,
results “continued to show improvement”;
and as the cpst all round was only £llls. Id.
per ton of concentrates, even heavy penalties
would still leave a very comfortable profit.
The financial position on June 30 was
very comfortable: —
1908. 19J2. • 1913. 1914.
Liabilities . . £279,373 £191,612 £118,006 £89,843
Liquid assets 258,987 591,390 502,505 439,591
Deficit , . £20,386 —•—
Surplus .... £399,778 £384,499 £349,748
But as just on £200,000 of this was repre-
sented by products in hand, and another
£76,971 by stores; it was decided not to nay
a dividend. Things have improved since then.
The first table shows only £16,147 written
off during the year, against £66,995 the year
before. This requires a word of explanation.
The practice of this co. is to charge all
capital expenditure to capital account, but
to write off a corresponding amount of profit.
In 1913 £71,564 was spent; £29,569 was
charged to working costs, and the balance,
£41,995, wa* written off. The latter amount
plus £25,000 written off to provide for con-
tingencies, made up the £66,995 then shown
as written off. Last year only £37,142 was
spent on capital account; £35,994 was
charged to working costs, leaving £1147 to
be written off. This, plus £15,000 trans-
ferred __to the contingency fund, makes the
£16,147 shown as written off. While, then,
a larger amount was written off in 1913,
actually less depreciation was charged in
that year to working costs than was done
last year.

The Australian Provincial Assurance Association
Ltd.—’ Tiie opening of the new offices of this Associa-
tion, which took place at Denison House, George
Street, Sydney, on the 25th of January, 1915. was
marked by a spirit of enthusiasm and confidence,
which left no doubt in the minds of those present as
to the immediate and ultimate success of the Associa-
tion. There was a large gathering, comprising
members of the press, directors, shareholders, policy-
holders and employees of the Association. The direc-
tors and the various other speakers who addressed the
meeting, representing the press, shareholders, policy-
holders and employees, spoke in eulogistic terms of
the rapid strides made by this progressive assurance
office. Not only is the amount of new business
written by this Association to date remarkable, but
the renewal premium income established is probably
unprecedented for the same period in the history of
Australian Life Assurance. When it is taken into
consideration that the A.P.A. has over 1100 share-
holders widely distributed throughout the different
States of the Commonwealth, all of whom are more or
less exerting their influence on behalf of the Associa-
tion without cost to the office, one is not surprised
at the remarkable progress made by this Association,
and, taking this factor into consideration, combined
witli the energy and enthusiasm displayed by ite
officers, it would be surprising if the results were
otherwise, as directors, shareholders, policy-holders
and employees are all working together with the one
object in view, viz.. The success of the A.P.A.*

years or so pass over to the State, the
requirements would have been well met.
However, the Minister for Works was till
recently member for one part of Broken
Hill and the ex-Treasurer and present Chief
Secretary was and is member for another
part of the same town ; and in the general
scramble for loan money Broken Hill
naturally got powerful help. But it is a
scandal, all the same. And nobody is going
to get much benefit out of it. Broken Hill
town and mines could have got cheap water
when the State gets the Stephens Creek
works for nothing, seeing that it wouldn’t
have to pay interest on anything more than
the cost of comparatively small additions;
but now it is loaded with interest and very
stiff sinking fund on about £350,000 put
into the new works.
The scheme adopted by Parliament in
connection with the Government supply was
that the town should pay a water rate, and
that the mines should pay 2s. 6d. per 1000
gallons. The thing has not been fixed in
i hat way finally, but it seems certain that
the town will pay a rate. If so, it means,
of course, that it will leave off drawing
from the B. H. Water Co.’s mains. Some
of the mines may draw more or less from
the co.; but they are not all friendly towards
it, though by a just-announced reduction to
3s. per 1000 no doubt it will command some
custom. The revenue for the co.’s brief future
is in any case going to cut into severely.
To adcj to its troubles, the mines’ require-
ments are much reduced owing to the stop-
page of the zinc-flotation mills, which are
great consumers of water. Doubtless the
co. will get a few pickings for the rest of
its life; but their size is a gamble. For
the rest, apart from fixed assets (dam,
mains, etc.), the co. has £99,417 net;
hut £30,010 of this is in tools, meters, pipes,
etc. There are 200.000 shares, so £lOO.OOO
would mean 10s. per share, and £BO.OOO
would mean Bs. To that must lie added
whatever profit the co. can make between
now and the deathbed scene.

From George Blakemore. formerly general
manager of Great Cobar, and good Austra-
lian advocate of baekblock development :
“Oof Bird,” of Westralia, writing the epitaph of
the local Golden Butterfly (B. 18/2/’l5), says the
cause of the stoppage is want of breath, otherwise
want of gold. He incidentally mentions the in-
tention of the hotel- and store-keepers to try every-
thing they know (bar putting up any cash them-
selves) to get the mine going again. It is presumed,
therefore, that these gentlemen are going to use the
Mining Act to force the owners to work or have
their leases cancelled. Such people would aim 'st
have one believe that the malevolent owner, as soon
as he finds a profitable mine, immediately closes it
down to spite Bung and the sugar adulterators.
If the much-vaunted labor conditions in mining
leases were ever of any use in maintaining mining
operations, surely here is-an opportunity to demon-
strate their quality. As for this State of N. S.
Wales, the Mining Act was not drafted with a view
to assisting the mining industry, if one is to judge
by the action of some of flic Mining Wardens during
this war crisis. In my opinion the penal clause
of labor conditions in mining leases has been a
curse and a hindrance to the industry. It is the
begetter of legalised blackmail and of much perjury,
and it lias never succeeded in bringing a defunct
mine to life, but has succeeded in killing a few
before their time. Any mine which can pay expenses
does not close down; but a mine that cannot pay
expenses on account of low prices for its product
or low-grade ore is not assisted by the refusal of
suspension of labor conditions.
There are always a few people who envy Naboth’s
vineyard, and the present system in vogue in N. S.
Wales of allowing secret reporting of non-fulfilment
of labor conditions on leases is rotten. What proof
does the Department ask of the secret informer
(who is trying to oust the present owner) of his
intention to work the lease and provide the money
for doing so? Absolutely none! Any man of
straw is encouraged to secretly report a lease owner
and claim cancellation of the leases, and the informer
is entitled to get beforehand notice of such and
finally secures the property. The mining laws as con-
structed to encourage spies. As a State we have
gone back to the days of the Lion's mouth in Venice.
If the secret spy were forced into the open, so that
he could be seen, less might be felt on the question:
but the whole business, as it is now, is a disgrace
to natural justice.
Consider, too, how the Crown treats its land
tenants. Why it differentiates between two men
taking up two pieces of land is an incomprehensible
puzzle to me. One applies for a leasehold
and calls it a farm. His treatment is sound and
proper. He is not saddled with any labor conditions,
and the Advances to Settlers Board will lend him
large sums of money on the easiest of terms. The
other unfortunate who calls his leasehold a mining
property is immediately faced with labor conditions,
high rents and taxes, and innumerable penalties are
set out with much unction in a Mining Act and a
Mines Inspection Apt. If every mining lease applied
for covered a valuable mine, then the line of
thought exhibited in the construction and adminis-
ration of the mining laws could be understood.
But not one per cent, of the mining leases applied for
develop into successful mines, and with this fact in
view the policy underlying the Mining Acts shows
up in a most stupid light. No industry is so heavily
taxed and none gets less intelligent assistance from
the State. The labors of its votaries are the founda-
tion of trade, and this war is demonstrating that
the metals it produces come near to being the
salvation of the British nation. Without the metals
it wins—gold, iron, copper and the possession
of them by Britain—where would we be in this
war? No industry has done so much for its country,
and its followers are the pioneers and explorers
of all lands. They are the advance guard of civil-
isation. This State may believe with ancient Greece
that mining is a curse. Greece 900 years b.c.
closed all its mines and interdicted the use of gold
and silver for money purposes, and it paid for it
by being a beggar nation for 2000 years.
Anyhow, the burden on the mine owner is getting
steadily heavier, and mining legislation is becoming
stiffen and more unreasonable with each new attempt
at law making. If all mine owners belonged to the
class of the hated capitalist, the person who is
to-day fighting England’s and the world's battle for
liberty by providing the sinews of war, one might
find a reason for things, crass and stupid as that
reason might be; but many of these mine owners
have sacrificed the good years of their lives in the
search for and a development of useful minerals.
One has but to look at the statistics of the State
to see that the mining industry is dying. “Killed
by too much law" is a good epitaph for it. Of
course a Broken Hill will survive in spite of the
law; but the day of the small mine is almost over
unless a wiser policy of encouragement by the State
is followed.
Well, assuming that labor conditions are
often a farce, what does Mr. Blakemore pro-
pose to put in their place? Would he
allow a pack of speculators to grab the
thousands of acres surrounding a block
which a legitimate prospector had found,
and then hang on till the latter had proved a
mine, on which they would promote a score
of companies to acquire their area, and thus
make fortunes for themselves without doing
a stroke of work? These speculators, who
pour large quantities of “water” into mining
flotations, and make a property struggle to
pay interest on £50,000 when not 50.000
pence have been put into it. are the worst
enemies of the industry—worse even than
the men who impose labor conditions; worse
even than those who subsequently administer
that law with cast-iron rigidity. And the
latter are bad enough. If the farm and the
mine get different treatment, it is because
the company shark doesn’t make use of a
farm-lease to entice the public into his jaws.
What Wardens and such-like won’t, however,
realise is that labor conditions were made
to protect the State against the do-nothing
speculator, and not to flog an almost down-
and-out co. into a final effort.
Manager Wainwright, of Broken Hill
South, estimates ore reserves at 3.350.000
tons. In the past seven years 2,115.483
tons have been bandied and £1.060,000 paid
in divs. The difference between that and
an average of 10s. per ton is so small that
it doesn’t matter. At the same rate the
reserves would be worth £1.175,000. There
are 200.000 shares, so the lot is equal to
£5 17s. 6d. per share. As no dividend was
paid last half-year though a substantial
profit was made—say. £OO.OO0 —the calcu-
lation shows up less satisfactorily than any
made on the same basis of late years. To
that valuation has to be added, first, the
surplus of liquid assets in hand. Discard-
ing supplies and stores this amounts to
£138,000, equal to nearly 14s. per share.
Add also the value of the slimes, of which
there are 304.000 tons, and from which it
lias been reckoned £1 per ton profit will be
made; and then remember that the estimate
of reserves does not include anything below
1170 ft., though an ore body has been broken
into at 1270 ft., and it will be seen that a
profit of between £8 and £0 per share can
be fairly reckoned upon, assuming that the
history of the past seven years is a guide
to the future. True, in the profit of the
past seven years have been included con-
siderable sums derived from stored zinc
tailings ; but as there are still 801,835 tons
of these, that source of revenue isn’t going
to run dry for years and years.
One thing in favor of the B. IT. South’s
future by comparison with its past is that
the deeper they go in the mine down to
1170 ft. the better are the metal contents:'
and naturally the largest percentages of un-
extracted ore are in the lowest workings.
Here, for example, are the values of the
ore extracted from the various levels during
the last half-year:—
Level. Lead. Silver. Zinc,
ft. p.c. oz. p.c.
250 .. .. 12.3 2.6 7.3
425 .. .. 14.8 7.7 12.9

1070 . . .. 15.3 7.5 14.5
1170 . . . . 15.8 6.5 14.2
Certainly the ore now being taken from the
upper levels does not represent the average
of the ore in its virgin state; nevertheless,
the table exhibits the position with enough
accuracy for practical purposes.
B. 11. South report, by the way, shows
considerable savings in costs for the past
half-year. The directors comment: “It is
gratifying to read in the manager’s report
that the working costs have been reduced
to 20s. 5.9 d., this in spite of the short time
worked.” The alleged savings may be com-
pletely disregarded. There is nothing in
them. As a matter of fact, mining cost
three-farthings more arid concentrating a
farthing more. The whole of the alleged
saving was in development work, which has
been merely deferred. And though the
milling cost actually id. more, it was of
considerably poorer standard, as the B. H.
Prop, ( which now does the South’s smelt-
ing! takes a concentrate of lower lead and
higher zinc content than the South was in
the habit of preparing for export before the
war.
Re C.S.A., Cobar, The Bulletin is told
that the District Court didn’t hear the co.’s
appeal against the Warden’s refusal of fur-
ther labor suspension. The co. withdrew
its appeal, having altered the position so far
as its holding of leases is concerned.

The Homeward Bound, at Oberon
(N.S.W.), has been re-pegged, and may
have another trial. Definite records of its
performances are practically impossible to
obtain, owing to its antiquity and the very
unsatisfactory condition of the Oldest In-
habitant's mind in regard to mining matters.
But this thing is certain—it was one of the
few mines in the Oberon district from which
several people made substantial rises, and
only for the heavy water it would
have been worked longer. The show appears
to lie in a sort of granite basin, with basalt
hills in close proximity, and water is an
acknowledged difficulty, coupled with bad
ground. There are signs of three small
batteries having been there at some time,
but records and results are wrapped in a
mist of obscurity and old age.
The old Lewis Ponds (N.S.W.) is mined
nowadays by the Sulphide Corporation for
pyrites, which are used in connection with
the co.’s prosperous chemical-manure works
at Newcastle.

Melbourne has sent a new manager to

gold, but not enough for a co. to live on for

that is ever likely to be found in the mine.

with a small 2oz. reef; but it will have to
dig up a bigger bodv of stone than it has at
present to justify the formation of a co. in

it the Edna May West. It is west of the
Edna May all right—four miles west. The

where this show is situated. About half a
dozen ventures are already waiting to be
marketed, and unless the public looks out it
is going to be hit.

The Macquarie, at Meekatliarra (W.A.),
has been turned down by a Tasmanian syndi-
cate after 12 months’ trial. A good deal of
work was done in that time ; but. although
some good values were struck in places,
results were on the whole too poor. To date
the show is alleged to have produced £28,000,
but the Mines Department figures are much
less.
Siberia Consols cupboard (W.A.) must be
getting very bare. Four months ago its
working capital was £lBOO. or £2500 less
than at the end of the previous six months,
and £4500 short of what it started with six
months before that. Accumulated speci-
mens have lately been taken out of the
safe, and £174 dollied out of them, which
looks as if most of the bala'nce in hand four
months ago has melted. As developments
are not likely to come to its rescue, another
strangled weakling will in all probability soon
be laid to rest in the Adelaide corner of the
Wild Cat cemetery.
Great Southern Consols, Rutherglen
(Vic.), has paid out £422,000 in cash. Of
that sum £lO.OOO trickled into shareholders’
pockets, the rest going for wages or contract
work, timber, plant, fuel and the etceteras
of deep-level alluvial mining. The money
to meet the cost of work, carried out over
miles of gutter, came in the form of £71,000
of subscribed capital and £250.000 of gold
won. Such a record is liable to make
catsmeat of people’s faith in deep-lead work.
Still, there are always fanatics ready to show
that the other chap is an ass, and Sydney to-
day claims the laurel crown from the tired folk
who laid it down months ago. They kept
their pecker up when the surface works
breasted a cyclone and the plant suffered;
and when the output kept down because of
the tight wash they were still not dis-
heartened. Six months* yield from 1992
fathoms has been l(558oz. Such an average
would give profits at most Rutherglen mines,
for 14dwt. dirt ought to pay if work can be
done on a big scale. But in this case the
exes, were not rqet, though the office doesn’t
itemise. The best feature to-day is that
leading drives to the south are getting a
better bottom; and if the indications point
to deep ground ahead, a surface bore is to
be sunk 1000 ft. ahead to see what the
chances are there. If they are good the old
mine may have another buck, with Sydney
taking all the credit for it.

WOMEN’S WEAK NERVES
Many women suffer from hyper-
sensitiveness of the nervous system,
induced by many causes. Excessive
nervousness is the bane of many lives,
and often a severe attack of nervous
breakdown follows on heavy, exacting
social or domestic duties. Where the
nerves are shattered by physical or
mental strain this is the medicine to
be relied on to quickly strengthen them.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, March 1, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
Ex-Governor-General Dudley’s second
daughter, Morvyth, is to have her coming-out
ball this year in London. She was IS happy
summers in November, and unofficially she
has been enjoying herself at dances for
several years. Moroyth was the handsome
tomboy of the Dudley menage in Sydney.
She was the despair of long-suffering gov-
ernesses ; yet even with the victims of her
youthful larks she retained her popularity
by reason of her sunny nature. For a while
she aiid her sedate elder sister, Lady Honor
Ward, went to lessons at the serious C. of E.
Grammar School, where the learned Miss
Badham looks, over her spectacles at young
ladies who make mistakes in Latin.
After six years’ strenuous work as medical
examiner in State Schools, Dr. Grace Boelke
has handed in her resignation. She finds
the pace under the reorganisation of that
branch of the Department too swift. To
examine the eyes, ears, teeth, speech (if
defective), nose and throat of 50 school
babes in about five hours (less interruptions)
is, she says, impossible if the work is to he
thoroughly done. It allows only six minutes
for the examination and cross-examination
of each youngster. “After keeping up this
pace for about 30 times six minutes,” says
Dr. Boelke, “I honestly believe that one
hardly knows whether one is examining
their toes or their teeth —so I’m not going
to attempt it any longer. ‘Thorough’ is a
word no medical officer with a. conscience
can afford to forget.”
The news that Air. and Airs. B. N. Wool-
combe, of Singapore, had been murdered in
the military riots last week, will have been
read with sincere regret by many people in
Alaoriland, where both were born. Airs.
Woolcombe was a bride of only a few
months. She was 'the daughter of AJr.
Alinchie, one time general manager of the
Bank of New Zealand, and now on the
London directorate. The marriage took
place in the Big Smoke, but most of her life
was spent at Christchurch. Air. Woolcombe.
the son of a fine old naval officer who lived
for many years at Timaru, was about 47.
He learned to play Rugby football and read
Horace at Christ’s College, which stands on
the banks of the gentle Avon.
Though minor protests against the unex-
pected raids of mosquitoes have been heard,
this summer has been a booming one for the
Alountains. Hordes of visitors have fled up
from the humid coast, and panting trains
have disgorged tons of baggage at the little
mountain stations.
Aledlow Hydro, which is perched on the
edge of the Kanimbla Valley, has a steady
stream of_week-enders who help to keep the
finances nicely oiled. Air. Frank Coffee, the
Chatswood man with the picturesque
coiffure, has been up taking in a breath of
air fresh off the Valley. Venour Nathan, the
Society male-trimming of smart tea-parties,
has been camping at the same breezy palace.
Airs. A. A. Dangar is whizzing through the
local gum trees with a couple of daughters.
Airs. Edward Terry, the kindly lady who
used to pour out tea for so many hunting
parties at Eastwood House, is in the neigh-
borhood with two daughters—Airs. Gal-
braith and the fair-haired Miss Terry. The
Sydney Hunt Club, by the way, passed over
to the great majority a while after its old
patron’s death.
Mrs. Harry Finn and her eldest treasure
are putting in a fortnight at the Napier,
Leura. The only son has recently sent
them a line to say he is on the way to the
interminable Front. Young Finn is a civil
engineer in a good billet with one of the
numerous railway companies in Spain. Alost
of the heads are Englishmen, who get good
value for Spanish dollars, and they parted
with Finn, junior, with manifest reluctance.
His billet will be waiting for him when
(d.v.) he goes marching home again.
A Sydneysider now ruralising at New
Norfolk (Tas.) says that Dr. Gibson, of
Hobart, is giving two sons to the next Expe-
dition, and a third, now studying law. is to
jump into khaki if he passes his exam, next
November.
Papua’s Lieutenant-Governor Alurray is
the parent of a strapping young six-footer
who is a lieutenant in the Ist Leinster
Regiment. He is now at the usual British
soldier-man’s address in France. A younger
son is only emerging from knickerbockers
or he’d be bustling off too. There’s but one
daughter, and she, of course, stays with
mamma.
Miss Clinch, a Sydney girl who has been
doing missionary woik in other parts,
chanced to be tripping through Germany
when William swung his axe. She was
promptly arrested as a spy, and searched,
with all the rigors of which the enemy is
capable. The thrill was over and the Aus-
tralian girl on her hurried way to England
before her relatives here had any tidings of
the unpleasantness. Now she is ministering
to the parti-colored heathen in Egypt, and
has wrestled more or less successfully with
Arabic. This language was thrown out of
the top window in the Tower of Babel. In
consequence it is so smashed up that even
Lord Cromer, who knows more about the
Government of Egypt than any other Eng-
lishman, confesses that he never attempts
to use it. French has been the commoner
means of communication between the high
officials of Pharaoh’s land.
Barrister Arthur Ivelynaek’s only daughter
Helen, otherwise Topsy, has said “Yes” to
Cecil, one of. the numerous sons of George
Boileau. The latter, many years ago, was
C.P.S. in Melbourne or thereabouts, and is
now what is artlessly called “a retired
gentleman.”
The Red Cross secretary wants to touch
Pat in his potato bags. The suggestion is
that every N. S. Wales grower of murphies
snail contribute a bagful to the Cause on
St. Patrick’s Day in the morning. Then
will Bryant and Hayes, of Sussex-street, dis-
pose of the harvest by auction.
The Russell French family had a special
interest in the Sydney, which changed the
Emden into marine-store wreckage a while
back. Lieutenant-Commander Finlayson, of
the craft, married a Russell French daughter.
The tar is also an Australian. His father,
David Finlayson, used to be general manager
of the Union Bank.
The William McMillan dame isn’t to
make a long stay in England. War con-
ditions there are said to be more depressing
than we can realise in this lucky bit of the
earth. The Calico Knight’s lady is due to
leave for Australia this month.
The Misses McKay, of the Victorian
“Sunshine” family, came back in the
Orsova. They had planned a scamper
through Europe, but, finding a mad bull in
the gateway, took a short cut home. They
saw Norway, though.
The oyster hat is at present only feeling
its way into the female heart through the
stage. It consists of a long, shell-like disc,
gummed or stabbed on to one side of the
wearer’s head. Hard pressed against this
grey-white background is the “beard,” repre-
sented by a tall, fluffy black plume which
soars aloft out of a cap-like crown. If the
oyster hat hits the popular fancy, it may be
followed by high-clawed lobster millinery.
The Benevolent Society’s annual meeting
served up the usual dry bones of figures, with
a few optimistic remarks concerning 1914.
Undeterred by the dreadful things that may
happen to a Governor who says what he
thinks, the Strickland sub-royalty highly
c< mmended the plain, unvarnished remarks
of Dr. W. Foreman on the slaughter
of the Innocents. Meanwhile the company
under the marquee looked down its indi-
vidual nose in pained silence. President
Neville Mayman, in mellow tones calculated
to reach the horizon, discussed ways and
means. His tall, slender lady was garbed
in the latest tailored suiting, and hatted in
the new black sailor millinery. Mrs. W. A.
Holman, on the platform, was visible through
the spots of a white veil that held in its
place a large hat of the picture species
wreathed with spiky white trimming.
Kathleen Baxter, the tall, handsome girl
who is the youngest of the frequently-in-
print Baxter family, of Burwood, was
married in January. She is a sister of
Margaret Baxter, who was secretary of the
’Austral Club in London till it was swallowed
mi by some other tea-and-talk meeting house.
Kathleen’s young man is Lieutenant George-
Renshaw, of H.M.S. Defence. The knot was
tied in the prevailing fashion —by special
license in London.
Mrs. Arthur Macarthur, a lady whose
clothes are supposed to be the last gasp in
style, has just descended to the steamy city
from the Carrington, Katoomba. If the
weather doesn’t behave itself nicely she
threatens to go aloft again—next time to
Leura.
The Australasian Women’s War Club, in
London, had its official christening party in
very bldak January weather. Lady Bunting
(whoever she may be) addressed the com-
pany, which was heavily rugged and fur-
coated, and Mrs. Merivale Mayer spoke up
for the Australasian woman and her desire
to push the patriotic barrow. Amongst the
regular weekly subscribers to this war club’s
funds are pianist Max Vogrich and his wife.
The lady used to be well-known here as
singer Alice Rees.
The Gib. the rock which juts out of Spain,
is an offensive place for anything so peaceful
as a Chamber of Commerce. Yet it 7ms one.
and it gave a big spread to Captain Glossop.
of the Sydney, and his tars when our cruiser
was in adjacent waters.
The goffing A. E. Hughes and his pretty
wife are likely to throw over Tasmania and
holiday at Leura this month. The mountain
village with the picturesque links, where you
can fall off the edge without an effort, is
still putting up “Housefull” notices. Tariffs
are rather higher, if anything, than they
were a year or two ago, so the war hasn’t
damaged the tourist traffic that way.
The knitting-needle has had a fresh impe-
tus from Mrs. Keith Jopp’s sock fund, which
is searching for your uttermost farthing.
One of the most ardent sock-builders for her
age is Mrs. Stewart, of Mount Stewart, near*
Bathurst —a pretty old lady with gossamer-
lace headgear. She has turned out a pile of
work which is the young knitter’s envy and
inspiration. Others, less up in the game,
continue to send in all manner of wild,
woolly things for Atkins. Among many
stories one is told of a lady who sent along
a pair of white socks—“for the trenches”—
with pink ribbon threaded round the tops. I
prefer that to any other yarn told between
clicks.
Have you noticed how female delegates
are forging to the front in all manner of
prayer-book associations ? Glory, rather than
cash, must be their motto. The N.S.W.
Methody Conference, which is now finishing
its annual cogitations in the Lyceum Hall,
solemnly alluded to the useful work done by
Mrs. Woods at Quirindi, and set its halo on
the brow -also of Miss Wheatley of Gunning.
The fusion of the various Methody sects
has had something to do with this. One of
them—-the Bible Christians —used to rather
specialise in the woman preacher, and when
all the Methodies were made one again, the
combination naturally had to swallow the
eccentricities of each.
Mr. Leslie Piper, of Sydney, has just
“done” Scotland, the more peaceful parts of
Continental Europe, and the less sandy
areas of Egypt by way of a health trip. He
is now on the Niagara, bound from Van-
couver for Sydney.
George Coates, like most leading
Australian artists in London, has some
brush work at the War Relief Exhi-
bition in the Royal Academy. To the
same walls George Lambert contributes a
black-and-white sketcli, “The Hospital.”
Bertram Mackennal and Harold Parker are
responsible for sculpture, and Tom Roberts
and Fred Leist are also exhibitors.
Everyone who can claim even a High-
lander’s cousinship with the late “Bobs”
has apparently forwarded his name and ad-
dress to the British-Australasian. Or,
perhaps, the journal has chased the informa-
tion for itself. There is quite a yard and a
half of Roberts relatives in this continent.
A Westralian Bunbury family—a formid-
able array—Mrs. Walter Gale (wife of the
clerk of the Commonwealth Parliament),
Mrs. W. G. Pickering and Mrs. Capell are
among others who have a right to put on a
dab of black for the great soldier.
A well-known Australian, R. E. Bush, of
Dalgety and Co., has given up his house at
Bristol (Eng.) for use as a Red Cross
Hospital. It shelters about 200 wounded
British and Belgian soldiers.
In England Ladies’ Territorial Commit-
tees have been stitching old kid gloves to-
gether, after slitting them into flat strips,
and making soldiers’ waistcoats of them.
The notion isn’t likely to take on here.
Discarded gloves are kittle-kattle stuff. They
give heartrending, splits on the slightest pro-
vocation. As waistcoats they would be only
a little more durable than tissue paper.
The Town Hall vestibule was packed with
women and fans the other afternoon while
Dr. Roth described the Red Cross Voluntary
Aid detachments. The crux of the oration
was the unshaken resolve of Red Cross
organisers in this city to prod young women
into hospitals for a few. weeks so that they
may know what to do when Bobby breaks
his nose. The Cullen lady presided at the
official table, handy to the exhilarating water
jug; and ILanbury Davies, happily without
his wig, read the apologies of those who had
engagements in a cooler corner.
We have had all sorts of processions to
capture coin for the Patriotic collection-
plate. But much the best of the lot was Satur-
day’s effort, for which the Sydney police and
firemen were mainly responsible. As they
paraded to the Agricultural Ground, accom-
panied by loud applause and other things
that paid better, there seemed to be nothing
missing except the fall of Wilhelm. Bobby
mounted on horses trained like white mice,
and Bobby on foot as the burgling profession
know him, and the fireman in his big brass
bonnet, made the meat of the show. The
bones were on view as the Lancers’ sliabby-
looking nags filed past.
Governor Strickland inspected the patri-
otic exhibits drawn up on the Agricultural
oval, and viewed everything down to the
most infantine Boy Scout. In the grand
parade Alma Rock Phillips sat inside a very
warm suit of chain armor as Joan of Arc.
She was mounted on a grey steed; and a
tail of knights, cased in the same oppressive
garments, rode gingerly behind. France was
represented by a girl got up to look as much
like the , famous Statue of Liberty as a jolt-
ing motor-chaise would let her. Scores of
Allies also had a wobbly ride round the
track. The Servians and Montenegrins
were chiefly remarkable for the brilliance of
their legs, which were clad in bright blue
and emerald green pants. Delfosse Badgery
whirred overhead, dropping missiles at
imaginary enemies. Roman chariots tore
madly round the arena, while the
drivers’ early-Italian petticoats stood out
like sails. Over £2OOO is likely to fall into
the Patriotic hat as the profit of it all.
Droves of women show a Spartan disre-
gard for climate, and already inspect
autumn coats, which are long, and skirts,
which are short and still gape at the sides.
Collars of fur, familiarly known as “fat
half-moons,” are going to keen the back of
your neck warm, Arini, in case you feel
chilly. They are cut off *n a line with the
ears, and are poor relations of the high
Medici collar that Mary Queen of Scots
wears at every fancy-dress ball.
Re skirts, the fashion prophets, removing
their pince-nez and looking into the future,
profess to see woman swishing round in
about three yards of material—in circum-
ference. After the yard-and-three-quarters
allowed for knee action, this new latitude
may lead the flapper to revive the ancient
game of leap frog in back gardens.
The Women’s Emergency Corps in Lon-
don (do you observe how military we are
getting?) is doing good work in a sensible
direction. Now is the time to capture the
toy trade; and _ the Emergency dames are
bustling to grab it for unemployed Britishers.
A high tariff would, of course, make surer
work of it; but that would be Protection —
and the. Freetrade joss hasn’t yet been for-
mally pitched out of the temple.
Sydney-born Marie Lohr has been among
the numerous patriotic-concert givers in
London. She drew a crowded Sunday-night
audience to the Palladium, and counted £4OO
in the plate. Marie not only organised the
concert, but sang, showing, as the London
Telegraph said, that she is “capable of
gaining distinction in more spheres than
one.” Among the contributors were a couple
of sister-Australians. Carrie Tubb and Madge
Titheradge. Miss Tubb is one of London’s
top-line concert singers-—an uncompromising
Australian democrat who retains a homely
surname with obvious suggestions of the
wash-house and the mangle. Most others
would have veneered it into Signorina
Tuberini long ago.
About the only social gathering ticketed
for the near future is the James Fairfax
party on March 11. Even this mild fes-
tivity, which is to give the Y.W.C.A. a kick-
off for its winter season of good works, will
be seized with avidity by local presswomen.
The new muffs are showing the tail of the
beast dangling down in front. The head
and claws are in their old nest, on the fur.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.
Private F. M. Lassetter, lately of Ypres,
who during two months at the front accumu-
lated eight bullet-holes in his overcoat and
one in his left hand, is back in Australia,
invalided. After visiting relatives he joins
the staff of his father, the Sydney man who
has a job in Kitchener’s army. Apropos of
the Tommy who. weary of the ministering
angels’ round liis bed, pinned on his counter-
pane the legend, “Too ill to be nursed to-
day,” Lassetter tells of how a soldier
wounded in the leg was carried into a hos-
pital staffed by society nurses of the type
that prompted Kitchener’s “Women and war
won’t mix.” He extended a leg which soon
was superabundantly bandaged. Later the
surgeon stripped the lint off and found the
meat underneath in good order and condi-
tion. “Y’see.” explained Tommy, “that ain't
the leg that was shelled. It w r as this ’ere
one. But as you wasn’t ’ere, I gave ’em the
other one to play with.”
“Chasubje” on a dead prophet:—
I must ch\llenge two statements or inferences by
“n.E.P.” (B. 25/2/T5) —first, that Wroe was on
the make; second, that his following- among the
Christian’ Israelites is extinct. There are still to
be found in Australia, England and the United
States many who venerate Wroe’s memory. As . I
knew him, he was an unselfish fanatic, who spent
his time in humble travelling of the globe, in
emulation of St. Paul. He died in Fitzroy, Mel-
bourne. The sceptre descended to him from Joanna
Southcott, though he had a rival named Taylor.
Ardent followers of Wroe remain in Fitzroy, with
their large bluestone church. The men have their
hair rolled up behind, and the women are in bonnets.
Wroe was presented with a mansion in Ashton,
Yorkshire, largely bought with Melbourne subscrip-
tions. Yet he would not reside there, but kept on
wandering in a poor, troublous way. Ashton seems
to have been the first locale picked for Judgment
Day, but afterwards the great roll-up was settled for
Jezreel’s Tower, an amazing place built in a London
suburb. His most notorious follower here in Melbourne
was Fisher, the Nunawading Messiah. This man
claimed the succession, but was kicked out. He
afterwards founded the Church of the Firstborn,
but died lately in Westralia without making a suc-
cess of it.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, March 1. 1915.
My Dear Yarrie. —
Saturday’s Newmarket opened the big
Autumn meeting at Flemington, and tlie
vice-regal crate was so full that it
looked as if someone should be prosecuted
for cruelty. The head of the G.-G. rose
quite naturally from a. huge Gladstone collar,
and one of his illustrious men-friends was
chiefly remarkable for a fierce tie. Her Ex.
looked slim and cool in a greeny-blue frock,
and the Stanley dame’s little hat was a
dream. (Don’t ask me to describe the dream,
please!) Melba, penned with the merinos,
wore a sporty checked coat and skirt. Gov-
ernor Galway, of S.A., was somewhere in
the press. 1 got one glimpse of very curly
hair, which, I think, was part of his fleece.
Francis Suttor and Miss Sutter, the Elliot
Lewis pair. Miss Hay and a full assortment
of Extra Gents, were also squeezed in some-
how. Really I don’t know which is the
worst —the Sydney stock-trains or the vice-
regal compartments at favorite meetings.
The large Newmarket field (24 starters) was
stuffed full of horses that Wouldn’t Jose.
As usual, wives, sisters, cousins and aunts
of owners fussed exceedingly and did mad,
reckless things with half-crowns. Tony
Hordern came over to watch First Principle,
but did not bring his wife. Still, any
capable man can watch a horse unassisted.
Dr. Kenna brought his wife from Sydney,
and she duly paraded in a handsome purple
gown and a little hat with a silver tassel.
The Baillieus were in great force—but then
they always are. Miss Baillieu. the prettiest
girl out, carried a sky-blue parasol and had
a gold butterfly in her bat. I waved my
umbrella as a mark of approval, but she
didn’t see me. The Falkiners were an
imposing row in the grandstand, and made
their applause heard when Norman of the
elan scored two wins. The Symes’ Blague,
after doing things in Tasmania and running
third in the Futurity, won the big race
easily. Mrs. Geoffrey, whose costumes
always make me swoon away, looked slim
and beautiful in a vision of an ivory-white
gown, with a filmy cape collar of valuable
lace, and a black hat buried in gold roses.
(Interval for refreshments.)
Mrs. Mollison. who is one of the Rolf
Boldrewood Brownes, wore a sort of ori-
flamme of red cherries and white muslin.
(If that isn’t definite enough, I can’t help
you. You should know my method by this
time.) Mrs. Leslie Stuart, in business-like
navy blue, motored out, after a strenuous
morning packing up her Sorrento summer-
household and bringing them home to
Toorak. Mrs. Tom Hogan wore a Grecian
band of stencilled gold on her smart" black
trappings. (Where? Bless you, my dear!
how should I know?) Mrs. Cameron’s
mustard dress fairly shrieked, but was
drowned by the uproar created by a yellow
miracle worn by the eldest Mount
Schank < ’larke girl. This Wagnerian opera in
cloth finished several inches below the
knee and showed pntt.v-colored understand-
ings. Mis. Clarke was in black, and looked
as like Queen Mary as possible. Another
Clarke girl wore white cloth and a flat dint:
of the newest sort. The .youngest and
prettiest blossom had on a duck of a race
coat, made of khaki, with bright fillips on
the lining, which the wind did its best to
show off. She had Genthelp Norman Hodges
as a shadow. The massed Clarkes were re-
garded as the dress event of the day by all
the rag-enthusiasts. Captain Harrison
helped at their tes party.
Mrs. Charlie Mitchell was highly decora-
tive in a brown rig-out. Mining-man Whar-
ton’s wife had all silken sail set, and
bowled along at a good four knots in com-
pany with her daughter, who covered up her
chilly muslin coon-stripes with a fur coat.
Ihe Adams girl looked smart and her new
fiance beamed. Muriel .Starr had a. purple
dress fastened with six dozen buttons down
the back. One girl wore a kilt and a
fringed leather sporran. Only a Red Indian
Highlander or a dressmaker would have
thought of such a mixture. Mr. and Mrs.
Sidebottoni. of Launceston (they are rela-
tions of High Commissioner Reid, you
know), were on hand with the pleasant
daughters. Mrs. Burch, the bride, came
over from Sydney, and wore a smart cerise
cockade in her little black hat. People
with very small heads have the fashionable
pull for the coming winter. The hat must
be as small _as possible. Mrs. Herbert
Power was in large stripes of black and
white. One talkative woman carried a
long parasol topped with a green parrot.
She proudly mentioned it was a present.
Clive Baillieu and Rubv Clarke were
married at great length in St. John’s.
Poorak. and the parson s exhortation would
have cured anyone’s insomnia. The bride
and groom, who bad to listen kneeling, were
in danger of being lamed for life; but I
suppose the cushions saved them. The final
dress procession down the aisle was really
divine—made one realise that there is some
innate holiness about clothes. The pale
green circular windows of the church were
filled with ferns and white silk, and the
pew-posts were wreathed with honeysuckle.
The wedding breakfast was at Cliveden, and
j£ any woman broke her front teeth eating:
six-months-old cake I didn’t hear of it.
The Very Best, being under shortened
sail, now make social events of charity con-
certs and mere matinees. They pay their
seven-and-six each, get into their loveliest
clothes, and bog in as it it were a Marcus
g U p erbug entertainment. Even at church
concerts, the plain-clothes citizeness is likely
to find herself surrounded by dazzling gar-
ments and suburban hedge-duchesses. When
there happened along a matinee at Her
Majesty’s, in aid of a theatrical benevolent
fund, you can imagine how the Shebrews
and the social non-coms, swarmed into the
place. As a further inducement to lovers of
cheap amusement, there was a full vice-regal
pack, and Melba had a special box. Amy
Castles made a first appearance (it was
officially listed as an “appearance”) since
her absence in foreign lands. But she was
only a distant voice singing behind a mass
of people who completely filled the theatre
and overflowed into the lounge and down
the stairs. No late-eomer had a chance of
getting near her.
How beautiful are the little acts of kind-
ness that singers and actresses do to their
sisters in public! Melba, from her box,
flung her flowers at the feet of Amy
Castles during the matinee at Her Majesty’s
on Friday. And what makes it more excru-
elating, than ever is the fact that Amy was
singing Melba songs.
Mrs. Davey—once our own M ayoress—
gave a party at the Town Hall to congratu-
late Mrs. Hennessy on the acquisition of her
complimentary title. Of course there was
an atmosphere of female heroism about the
pretty function. Had the cards fallen differ-
cntly—hut there! What’s the use of repin-
j ug ? The aldermen’s wives presented the
fresh-baked Lady with a silver rosebowl as
a token of their delight. Mrs. Davey did
the necessary speechifying. She ‘ was
wrapped for the occasion in lovely purple
clothes, and wore a hat that Solomon himself
would have picked out of a dozen autumn
millinery shows. Never before was eloquence
n ,adc so easy; wash-tub gossip in those duds
would have sounded like the neatest thing
Demosthenes ever got off. The Ivnight-
mayor’s wife nearly burst into tears as she
listened to the vocal honey. It: was so unut-
tcrably sweet that one longed for a bitter
remark to flavor it.
Some handsome daughters, beautifully
dressed, sat near their mammas. They hail
their kiss curls all in place, because‘there
was a rumor of a flashlight to come The
Hennessy dame tried to entice this rigid
circle to come forward and examine the
present; but they baa-ed with one voice '“We
have seen it.” and remained where they were
only showing signs of animation when tea
was brought in. The elattor of cups dis-
turbed the Gaud Mayor, who was doing some-
thing to the Belgian Relief Fund in an ad-
joining room. He presently appeared like a
beautiful vision before the roomful of women
and made a speech. Then silver-haired
Davey came in. saying jauntily. “There is
no regiment of women can frighten me

The songstress has been doing her share
for the relief funds. Last week she had a

Monday, and another at Geelong on
Wednesday. Geelong did what was expected
of it by going crazy. The Stanlev dame
went down and stayed with the Lascelles
for the event. The Voice attended the

Wednesday afternoon, and then flew down
to Geelong, arriving just in time to fulfil

Mollie, who has a voice of her own, will

lift, for she won a South-street champion-
ship with it some time ago.
Sylvia, the pretty elder daughter of 0. W.
Bell, of the Bank of Australasia, is
off this week to England, whence she
only emerged last year. She i* braving
the perils of the Channel to meet her bride-
groom-elect. a fascinating naval lieutenant.
Sylvia will stay with his parents both before
and after, the event, which may, however, be
postponed owing to the uncertainties of war.
Lieutenant Man (one “n,” please) has just

A Westralian girl, Enid Woolf, passes
this village homeward bound in the Medina.
She has had a mild social burst in Sydney
and Bowral, and has been housed by the
affable Tony Hordern pair. “Beauty’s”
mother was a Miss Booth, a sister of Mrs.
Sam Hordern, sen., who, by way of a change,
also goes to London by the Medina. Some
20 years ago Miss Booth mated Louis
Woolf, a Hebrew youth of good looks and
manners. Since that time the Woolf family
has assisted in keeping Perth from severe
social stagnation.
The motor-car that terrifies with its toot
brought destruction the other Monday to an
elderly Adelaide spinster who was visiting
Melbourne on behalf of the Young People’s
Scripture League; from which it appears
that Providence is no respecter of persons
where car accidents are concerned. In this
case, as in most cases, the lady was killed
by timidity. The car was not travelling
fast, but when its toot alarmed the good
leaguer she didn’t hurry out of its way—she
stepped back further into its way. Women
crossing a street rarely take Kipling’s view
of the situation :
If we go forward we die.
If we go backward we die.
Better to go forward and die.
That gloomy Ivipple ought to be displayed
at the corners of all streets where tramcars
and motors threaten the righteous and the
unrighteous.
Katherine Prichard, who before going to
London presided over the evening Herald’s
Women’s Page, has won a prize of £250
offered by Hodder and Stoughton for a novel.
The Shakspeare Society has awakened
from its summer slumber, and is about to
start biz again like a lawyer refreshed. Pro-
fessor Ernest Spott will read a paper on Re-
cent Shakspeaijan Criticism (how these
Bardolaters lovV talking of one another !)
at the Austral Salon on Friday night. The
rest of the Society’s business will be the
annual balance-kheet; and the election of
standard-bearers.
Captain AnstrutJfier. an A.D.C. of the
past, is now getting short rations in a Ger-
man prison. The .Captain, who was about
seven feet high in his boots (I never saw
him without them), fame out with the pre-
sent G.-G., but fleet back with Genthelp
Blackwood at the first note of the War
God’s gong. Now qbe Germans have got
him and his tall appetite.
Notes of a wild wefck in Adelaide :
The Wattle Day League’s entertainment in the
Town Hall on Wednesday* drew a big enough audi-
ence to make the committee decide on serving it up
again as soon as it has got clear of Saturday’s
demonstration at the Exhibition Oval. The Governor
presided and introduced the lecturer. Mr. de Martin
had just left his native Belgium for a trip through
the rest of Europe when wan broke out, and he was
in Paris when France was cfrawn into the melange.
Yet, though his appeal wa4 good, only £6O was
wrung out of the congregation towards the purchase
of the “Wattle Day” motto-ambulance. In the
organ recital that preceded the lecture, our I’. H.
Jones, Mus. Bac., included a little thing of his
own—a fantasia on the “M&seillaise,” and it did
him proud. ,
The David Powers, who recently sold their station
in the North to the Government for closer settlement,
have moved to Brighton and installed themselves in
the house built there by the Delprats in the early
days of that seaside village’s sudden leap to popu-
larity.
The engagement is announced of Hermione, Dr.
and Mrs. Evans’s only daughter, to John, the fourth
son in the F. W. Stokes dovecote.
Mrs. Hope Murray and her daughter left for
Melbourne on Monday, called thither by the Hope-
Mtnray wedding on the following Wednesday.
Monica Murray and Alison Crozier, others of the
clan, also made the excursion.
Cricket is bff. The inter-State match drgw only
a light drizzle of people to the Oval, in spite of a
complete drought of counter attractions and bearable
weather. A few enthusiastic men were in the
smokers’ stand, but woman stayed home and knitted.
Died at Port Lincoln on Sunday, Mrs. E. Steven
son, who had lived there for over 70 years. Her
people, the John Tennants, settled first of all at
Chain of Ponds, and then tried their luck with
sheep on the West Coast. They took up Talajia sta-
tion at a time when Black Brother was apt to press
his attentions too far. She first married Mr. Fred
Haigh, of Tiatucka station, and when she was left a
widow with two small sons, her knowledge of stock
ami station management: made it a comparatively
simple thing for her to carry on the plaice herself.
Her second husband, Mr. C. E. Stevenson, died some
years ago. Her one son, John, is still part-owner
of Tiatucka; and her one daughter is Mrs. A. X.
Hughes, of Athelney, Hackney.
Dr. and Mrs. C. W. Hamilton left for England U\
the Egypt on Thursday. Miss Anderson, who ha's
guided the Y.W.C.A. in this State for some years,
was a passenger by the same boat.
The vice-regal Galways were at the theatre on
Monday evening to see “The New Sin.” Lady Doris
Blackwood, Miss d’Erlanger and Private Sec. Mol
Holland chaperoned them. On Friday the Governor
left for Melbourne, where he is to stay with the
Stanleys for 10 days.
Rifle clubs are epidemic. The Stock Exchange
has one, and a ladies' club has been formed,
with Mrs. David Fulton as secretary and Ethel Wyatt
as treasurer. The first practice is to be at the
School of Mines range on Thursday. Haven’t
you an aunt at Murray Bridge that you want to
see that afternoon?
1 he ( all to Arms has been answered
trorn Sydney by the youngest sou -of Mrs.
Melbourne Macnamara, a nephew of mfl-
honaire Millie Cooper. He passed through
lor London by a recent boat, and hopes t«.

A youthful Atherton boy lias also gone—the
baby son of Mr. and Mrs. Tom. Another
Sydney juvenile in this great game is Lewis
son of Norman Cohen. In the midst of his
packing-up lie has been busy getting engaged
to Eileen, only daughter of Mr. and Mrs
Fred Michaelis, of Melbourne.
Lena Kingston, who went to England
more than a year ago to get her fine soprano
polished, is coming back with a wonderfully
improved voice and a sad heart. Her
teacher, D’Hardelot, predicted great things
for the bonnie Melbourne girl as the result
of a year’s study, and Australians in Lon-
don have sent glowing accounts of her. But
the war left her no prospect of an early
careei in giand opera or on the concert
platform, so she decided to get as far as
possible away from the rumpus. Before
leaving slie came into touch with the horrors
of war by singing to wounded Belgian
soldiers-, and the memory of the scene haunts
her, she writes.
On Wednesday of last week, Cecil, one of
the sons of squatter Fisken, without con-
sulting anybody but himself, married a hand-
some lady and carried her off to a farm in
the country. The numerous feminine
Fiskens have, however, “taken up” their new
relative, and all is well—or at least fairly
well. <
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

How to Have a Clear
Complexion.
It is quite easy even in a hot climate like
Australia to prevent the wrinkling, drying
and blotching effect of the dust and heat, but
it is absolutely necessary to use a pure soap
without any added coloring matter or excess
of soda. Puritol Wax Soap is such
a soap, with just a little fine pei-
fume added, and some Puritol wax.
which has such a reputation for keeping the
skin soft and for removing pimples and
blotches. A very fine film of the wax is left
on the skin after using this soap, which
effectually protects the skin from heat and
dust. Its healing effect is well known on
blotchy skins, and undoubtedly many of the
fine complexions are due to the use of Puritol
Wax Soap.*
POLITICAL
POINTS
There certainly is something to inquire
into in connection with military expenditure.
The hiring of the first transports, in the
days before Pearce’s arrival, is one thing
that has puzzled many people. A longshore
story told subsequently was that, in conse-
quence of the employment of certain vessels,
the bunch carrying Australia’s first expedi-
tion to Egypt was delayed no less than eight
days, and the waste, counting in the hire of
steamers and other expensive details, ran
into thousands. It would almost have been
money saved, in fact, had one vessel in
particular been brought out and carefully
burned.
THE MILITARY SPIRIT.
There is already an improvement in the physique
of our citizens. —Daily paper.
Fisher, member of the House of Reps, for
Wide Bay (Q.), has announced that the
Commonwealth Government is going to
tackle an alleged strategic railway, designed,
it seems, to enable Yarcowie, Winnininnie
and other townships in the north of S. Aus.
to pour men info Queensland for the defence
of Brisbane and Pinkenba. This line, it
appears, is to wriggle across the map at a
cost of from £2500 to £3OOO a mile. Some
years ago a War. Railway Council, or a
Railway War Council, or something of the
kind, was constituted, and the Railway Com-
missioners were all made colonels. This
body met in Melbourne recently, and pre-
sumably the railway colonels discussed with
the other warriors this big question of the
strategic railway that is designed to crawl
into Fisher’s backyard. Before he goes any
further it might be just as well for the
Prime Minister to produce the resolutions of
the council respecting this railway. If any
information was given by the railway colonels
respecting actual cost of construction in
similar country, it would be as well to have
that, too. And in the very probable
event of Mr. Fisher not having any such
resolutions and any such information, then
he had better set to work to get them.
Thus the N.S.W. Worker, in a voice of
dignified reproach :
But had Australia long since adopted a thorough
policy of working up its own raw materials, its
population to-day would have been much greater, and
its reliance on other countries for its markets pro-
portionately less. The economic effects of the war
would in like degree have been minimised, and we
should not have had to learn a lesson from
adversity.
Considering how Labor “sank the fiscal
issue,” and remembering that The Worker
refrained from discussing the subject, this
sounds like self-accusation. The only rea-
son why Australia has not long since
“adopted a thorough policy of working up
its own raw materials” is that Labor in
Parliament sat on a rail, pleading that, un-
less it could protect the artisan and the
worker equally with the manufacturer, Pro-
tection was no good to it. It was a shoddy
excuse, too, seeing that organised Labor had
proved quite capable of pushing up its
wages even beyond the point justified by the
height of the Tariff.
THE DRESSMAKER LAUGHS AT
THE PROPHET.
"East is East and West is West,
And never the twain shall meet."
“Happy Jack” Scaddan, the ingenious
Westralian Premier who could make a deficit
out of a mint if he got the gold for nothing,
has at least the virtue of trying to make
good some of his losses. Besides an amuse-
ment tax of a penny in the shilling, he
proposes a super-income tax starting from
1 per cent, on incomes of from £156 to £3OO,
and running up to 8 per cent, on those on
the fat side of £3OOO. The Assembly, where
the Labor Government has an amiable
majority, swallowed the super-income tax in
a lump, but the other House is turning the
pill over in its mouth. Westralia deserves
some sympathy, for its farmers have had a
poor harvest, and most of them have never
had a good one; but it deserves other things
a lot more. In years when it ought to have
had the biggest surpluses in Australia it
grew deficits as a matter of course; and
Scaddan has merely produced a bigger crop
of the old weed.
Fashionable St. Columb’s, at
Hawthorn (Vic.), is so busy
thinking about kingdom come
that it hasn’t time to give Aus-
tralia a hearing. The question
of installing a new organ came
up for discussion lately, and it
was decided that only a box o’
whustles made in another coun-
try would fill the bill, notwith-
standing that there are already
in Melbourne several fine instru-
ments locally made, and that the
landed cost of the imported
article towers above the figure
an Australian builder would be
glad to take. These victims of
the foreign-trade disease' are
quite incurable. If the local
article is dearer than the im-
ported they lament the high
charges imposed upon pur-
chasers of Australian manufac-
tures, and buy somewhere else.
If the local article is cheaper,-
then they still go on buying
somewhere else on the ground
that the “colonial” goods can’t be as good.
When St. Columb’s reaches Heaven, The
Bulletin foresees trouble unless its halo is
marked “Best Imported—Made in Hell.”
The sort of thing that may happen to the
eyes of Australia. From a Sydney daily
paper -
WANTED, energetic young Man, £25 capital,
take over complete Optical Outfit, test case, stock,
etc., value £25, tuition given free, easy £5 week
right man. Apply quickly, any evening, after 6
o’clock.
Notice that the only qualification required
is £25; the energetic young man who pro-
duces that, having taken a few free doses of
“tuition,” will go out as a full-blown opti-
cian; Isn’t a measure to suppress the quack
eye-tinker one of the many things forgotten
by the Wade-Holman Government?
The great British army machine now
seems to be in good working order; where-
fore coincident with the news of ex-Minister
Seeley’s promotion at the front comes the
unofficial report that, in the spring, when the
young man’s peaceful fancy turns to love,
Kitchener will vacate the chair and cross
the Channel to take charge of the camp.
Then, presumably, Seeley, the politician-
soldier, will return to the chair and carry
added “dog” on account of bi« higher rank
and war service. Whatever they may be as
administrators, these politicians are fine
strategists.
HEDGING THEM IN.
The Rev. J. T. Robertson (president of the Council
of Churches) said that a situation had raisen with
which the Christian church ought to cope. There
was not at present a sufficient hedging round of the
soldiers, and the churches should perfect such equip-
ment as would enable the troops to put up a good
fight. —Melbourne news item.
From a politician in England:—
I see the N.S.W. Government, notwithstanding its
professed solicitude for Australian industries (I can-
not say “home” industries, as that would mean, to
an Australian, those of the Mother Country), lately
ordered another batch of 60 locomotives from
Britain. This shows how useless it is to legislate
in favor of native labor when the legislators are at
heart upholders of the importing interests. Men
who thus connive at infringing the spirit of their
own laws are nothing less than traitors to their
country, and. should be impeached and ignominiously
expelled from office. No British administration,
despite its ostensible adherence to Frectrade, would
dare to order a warship abroad, the fact being that
England is Frectrade only in so far as it suits itself.
At this moment there is even a fierce agitation in
Birmingham against a proposal to import granite
from Norway for the new municipal buildings.
Once more a Labor Government has been
too languid to carry out its own policy. Tn s
time it is in the matter of making chloro-
form for Australia. As soon as the German
supply stopped a Victorian chemist ap-
proached the Commonwealth Government and
suggested that, as a commercial enterprise
which was certain to succeed, it should start
in and make the article. If required , he would
direct matters; but, being an academic map,
his position must be honorary. The Govern-
ment promised to “consider” the suggestion,
and it went on considering while a manufac-
turing co. made an actual start. Soon this
co, —fortunately one of the best —will be able
to make the sleepy liquid in such quantities
that a year’s supply for Australia will be
available in three weeks. Then comes the
chance of an export trade.
That either quite mad or quite corrupt
agreement made between the N.S.W. Gov-
ernment and the Norton Griffiths middlemen
threatens to cost the State tens of thousands
of pounds besides the commission. The
foreign firm is to be paid a percentage on
what it spends ; the more a work costs the
more money it will rake into its own pouch.
Consequently it will not be to the firm’s
immediate interest to contest claims made to
Wages Boards, no matter how preposterous
they may be. This, of course, will mean
that the State will be liable to pay the
preposterous wages. But the harm won’t
stop there. If Brown and Jones and Smith
employ (say) oyster-openers, and Jones’s
men get an award of twopence an oyster,
Brown and Smith’s men don’t have to go
into the whole business; all they have to
do is to show that Brown’s and Smith’s
oysters don’t open any easier than Jones’s,
and automatically the Jones award applies
all round. Hundreds of employers will curse
the Norton Griffiths scheme before it is fin-
ished. and the largest of those employers is
going to be the Government of N, S. Wales.
Campbell, of the N. S. Wales Farmers
and Settlers’ Association, smarting under
the defeat of Blacket for Castlereagh,
promises opposition to Labor and Liberal-
ism in 26 or 28 seats at next general elec-
tion. Which suggests a crop of very small
spuds in the future. Yet, why shouldn’t
there be a Country Party? Also a Mulga
party? And a Blacksoil party? And a
party for the Billabongs? Certainly as well
as a Liberal party there ought to be a half-
breed Liberal party; and a £abor party as
well as a plain Labor party. Members of
50 different shapes wouldn’t then have to
try to all squeeze into one or other of two
holes; and elective Ministries would follow
as a natural consequence.
When in Oppo-
sition Holman, of
N.S.W., was accus-
tomed to make
sarcastic remarks
about Governments
“whose only virtue
was their ability to
raise loans in Lon-
don.” YVanted now
from Holman a
few observations
about the virtues
of a Government
which can’t even
raise loans without
the assistance of a
foreign middleman
named Norton
Griffiths.
George Reid, who fought the Socialistic
Tiger so valiantly in Australia and fled to
London when he could no longer maintain
the struggle, now, on his 70th birthday, finds
the brute thoroughly installed in the seat
of Empire. On the outbreak of war it took
less than a week to pass 42 Socialistic Acts;
and it will take more than a century to
repeal them. Recently an inspector dis-
covered that a Northampton bootmaker had
two machines idle. He pleaded that he
could not help it, as his men had enlisted ;
but the Bench blew him out on the ground
that if he had reported the matter to the
military authorities the men would have
been compelled to stay on till their places
were filled. So a fine of £lO was handed
out, under one of the 42 Acts, and he was
warned that if he was caught again some-
thing horrible would hit him.
During January £4,712,480 was deposited
at the Savings Banks under State control
in Australia, or £194,955 more than was
withdrawn. No fewer than 32,090 new
accounts were opened, and on January 31
there was £80,873,566 at the credit of
1,983,821 depositors. Yet, in spite of 32,090
new depositors and £4.712,460 new deposits,
the N.S.W. Government talks about its
“war crisis” —though it hasn’t to buy so
much as one military button. Besides pil-
ing up taxation, it gives this alleged crisis
as an excuse for floundering to a private
middleman firm in England to back its bills
and help it splash more loan money on local
extravagances.
Maoriland is guffawing over poor, simple-
minded Ilenare. He had been dragged from
te pill-yrd room to court about a loan ob-
tained from a trustful pakeha. “What you
do with the £2 ISs. you borrowed from plain-
tiff?” asked the wronged one’s solicitor.
“Oh, that all?” said Ilenare evenly. “By
kolly, I give it te war fund.” But why
not? The defence should be a good one in
any court in Maoriland. The Maori had
only followed the lead of the collective pale-
face who in a moment of wild excitement
not long ago allowed lou Ward to borrow a
couple of millions and give the proceeds to
te war fund. Now unimaginative beaks
make orders for patriotic brothers with
brown skins to pay back forthwith their bor-
rowings to assist the fund, while High Com-
missioner Tam Mackenzie blithers about the
titled Joseph having perpetrated “an act of
supreme statesmanship.”

IN TIME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Minister of Forests says that “it is all a
matter of time.” The Ministerial promises will all
be carried out—in time. —Melbourne Auis.
“In good time, when I am ready,
Wondrous schemes shall 1 unfold ;
But we must be cautious, steady,
Cleaving to the safe and old.
Patience, prudence must prevail;
They who venture often fail.”
Thus the politician, weakly
Of the big things of the State;
While the patient public, meekly
Wait, and ever hopeful, wait;
While he slyly wooes their vote
With shrewd turnings of his coat.
But, in time, when other people
Populate this troubled world,
Lo, from housetop and from steeple,
Futile curses will be hurled—
Curses on the shiftless ones,
Feckless robbers of their sons.
AVhen the last good tree has withered
In an arid, rainless clime,
Then the weary soul who blithered
Of the verdancy of Time
Will grow restless in his grave,
While his baulked descendants rave.
They will curse the generation
That has beggared them by stealth ;
Curse the mad procrastination
That has robbed the land of wealth—
Wealth their foolish fathers spent,
Reckless and improvident.
“What care we?” declare the spoilers.
“We have ample for to-day !
Other ages, other toilers—
Let them suffer as they may.
Let the nation’s hope be killed,
That our bellies may be filled!
“If to-day our wealth be doubled,
If to-day our trade be good,
Why should we be plagued and troubled
With vague dreams of nationhood?
For our selfish purpose we
Gaily rob posterity.”
Robbers of the coming race,
Glibly crying “In good time,”
If one day ye had to face
Sons, and answer for your crime,
With that cry still in your throats,
How, then, would ye scheme for votes?
VICTORIA.

NO MEN TO SPARE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Officials have been withdrawn from the Australian
immigration agencies. —London correspondent.
They sent braw men from Scottish hills,
And from fair English fields they came,
From farms of France* and German mills,
From Russian steppes and Austrian rills
Our broad Australian wilds to tame.
But now no men can we command —
At home they’re going on the land.
The people felt an urging strain
That turned them from their native marts
To wooded mount and open plain,
Where spaces for the golden grain
Were calling to the gallant hearts.
But now ’tis' not by honest toil
The workers fructify the soil.
Their own lands need them; Mother Earth
Is bidding them with sterner will,
And wider "spreads the fearful dearth
Of younger sons of vital worth,
The evil need of men to kill.
They scorn what fruits our country yields
To populate their battlefields.
Our empty spaces must abide,
For Europe clasps her heroes fair
Upon a bosom cold and wide—
Insatiate and monstrous bride,
She has no able men to spare.
At dawn upon her couch is spread
Her toll of lovers stricken dead.
VICTORIA.

WHAT IS
HOME
WITHOUT
MUSIC? '
The real spirit of home is
lacking —without music, and
true comfort is not realised.
There is not the same sym-
pathy in a family without
the softening influence of
music.
The choosing of a Piano,
then, is more important than
is generally supposed. We cannot speak too highly of-
THE
“BROADWOOD” PIANO
The sweetness and richness of its.tone places it in a class by
itself, and its delightfully light and easy touch commends it to
all music lovers.
The possession of a “Broadwood” is at once a pleasure and a
delight to all, a perfect piano, and a valuable addition to any home.
Perfect construction adds to its other qualities durability, and
renders it proof against all climatic influences.

(From a photo.)
Syclu e y, in
which she cre-
el i t s D r.
Morse’s Indian
Root Pills for
bringing relief
from persistent
attacks of
asthma and
bronchitis, is
worthy of con-
sideration by
all people who
are likewise
affected. Mrs.
Brown does
not say she
was cured,
neither do the
proprietors of
Dr. Morse's
Indian Root
Pills claim
them to be a
cure, but they
do claim they will bring relief from these
most distressing complaints. Mrs. Brown
writes
“For six or seven years I was a great
sufferer from chronic asthma and bronchitis,
which used to lay me up for weeks at a time.
I got very reduced in health. I could not
trust myself to go out without I had a
violent attack. One day a friend persuaded
me to try a few Dr. Morse’s Indian Iloot
Pills which she gave me. They gave me
such relief that I sent and bought a bottle.
Whenever I feel an attack coming on 1
immediately take them and get all right. 1
don’t suffer one quarter the agony now. and
I have every confidence of a permanent cure
later on. I always have a bottle in tlm
house and I always recommend them to any
that suffer like I did ; it is only fair that
others should know the worth of them. You
have my permission to use this for adver-
tising purposes.’’*
SPORTING
NOTIONS
A lot of early double bets blew out when
Sir Solo was scratched for the Australian Cup. Sir
Solo’s claim to the confidence of hopeful punters
was in the fact that he won the Auckland Cup a
year ago, and had, since then, run some bad races
in Australia when he was a first favorite. On paper
the horse was a second-rater, but many eyelids
winked at any mention of his name. Therefore
the early books quoted the Maorilander at a short
price. They made a false favorite of Sir Solo, and
the punters swallowed the bait,
* * * *
It will be interesting to see what profit or
loss Victorian punters make by backing Eric
Connolly’s horses at the present V.R.C. meeting.
One way and another the confusing Connolly—with
the gees he trains and owns himself, and the other
gees he is intimately concerned with, and his
practice of backing several in the same event, before
they start and whilst they are running—has become
the most exasperating proposition in Victorian turf
commerce. His transactions seem to be equally
obnoxious to the many (including bookmakers) and
fascinating to the few, especially the few who are
always in the inner know, more or less. For
punters in the outer know there is little enough
satisfaction in backing “Connolly’s fancy” at star-
vation odds. His Caulfield representatives panned
out as follows:
s.p.
Omega . oto 4, finished 2nd
Meritus \ 2to 1 ~ Ist 1 •
Honorine jBto 1 „ 2nd f m same race.
Royal Alice ( 7to 4 „ 2nd t ■
Honorine \4to 1 „ Ist ( 111 s,ame rate ’
Clontaft ~ 6to 4, fell at second fence.
So Connolly was calamitous as usual to backers of
first favorites, seeing that his “good things” were
beaten three times,out of four, and the oidy winner
in the quartette was a 2 to 1 chance. Even though
the Tote could have no other good purpose than
to queer the pitch of Eric Connolly, the poor
punters ought to pray for it. But all the big
gambling interests are opposed to the honest demo-
cratic Tote, and there is precious little chance of
its being pushed through the Vic. Legislature. The
unholy alliance of wire-pullers and wowsers is too
strong.
# ■* * *
The crowd at Flemiugton last Saturday
was probably a record for the Autumn meeting;
and, although three w.f.a. races brought forth
only 13 runners in all, the sport was good enough.
History repeated itself in the Newmarket Handicap.
Three years ago the dandy little Tasmanian colt,
Desire, carried Bst. 121 b. into a place for the
Futurity, and then proved his excellence by winning
the flutter at Flemington with 151 b. less on his
young back. This year Blague—a colt of the same
stamp as Desire —ran third in the Futurity witli
9st. 41b. up, and won the Newmarket, carrying
Bst. 41b. The difference in the weight was seemingly
a big consideration in Blague’s case. The honest
little battler won easily, whilst Flash of Steel (who
got away in front, but seemed to lose ground half
way in the race) finished only sixth. All the same,
the imported colt was not disgraced. He will not
be three years old until next month, and is big for
his age.
Prior to the Newmarket the field was thought to
be more “classy” than usual. Traquette, Woorak
and Athenic, not to mention old Gigandra, Flash of
Steel and Herringbone, carried a lot of sprinting
reputation. A fast race was anticipated as a cer-
tainty ; yet the winner’s time was only moderate.
His nearest followers were lownit (the winner last
year) and Jolly Beggar (the runner-up in 1913),
who carried a lot more than their former burdens.
lownit, seemingly, is one of the most trustworthy
of the crack sprinters. The attempt to make a Gup
horse of him in the Spring was a failure, but as
soon as he was put back to the old game he re-
covered his wonderful dash.
Mountain Knight’s easy victory in the St. Leger
settled any remaining doubt as' to the flukiness of
Carlita’s V.R.C. Derby win. The filly couldn’t live
with the favorite when he was given his head, nor
prevent Naxberry from getting second money.
The best spectacular event was the meeting of
oft-triumphant De Gama and the not-fully-wound-up
Land of Song in the Essendon Stakes. To those
who had backed De Gama for the Australian Cup
it seemed that, if the Maorilander was nearly ripe
for a 2)-miles journey three days later, the best
policy would be to let him go as he pleased in this
12-furlongs event. The same theory applied to the
third runner, Pistol King. Nevertheless, the three
jockeys went out with orders to wait, and like bike
riders they manoeuvred to get behind one another.
Finally De Gama was left in front, fighting for his
head, and for six furlongs the pace was slow to
middling. Then McLaclilan, on De Gama, shook up
his mount and the sprint began. Land of Song
had about two lengths of leeway to make up. The
two heads were level a quarter of a mile from
home, and a long ding-dong finish ended in favor of
the imported gee by a head. Pistol King was only
two lengths away 7. Had his jockey allowed him to
make the pace from the start the two cracks would
probably have given him too much grace and ho
would never have been caught. Presuming that
Land of Song was still short of work, he promises
to show his heels to anything in the near future.

Established in 1863, the Australian Cup
(run in March) is only two years younger than the
Melbourne Cup. Barwon was the first winner.
Woodman alone scored more than once—in ’65 and
'66. Saladin twice dead-heated with Flying Dutch-
nan, in 1872, before annexing the bullion. Winners
in the next dozen years included First King, First
Water, Navigator and Malua. The last-named won
in 1886 (two years after bis Newmarket victory)
and he did it with 9st. 91b. in 4min. Ojsec. The
weight is still the record, the only other winners
to hump 9st.. being Tartan 9st. (ilh. and Highborn
9st. 41b. Malua’s time was a new record in those
days, but the 3min. 56sec. of Wallalo (7st. 101 b.)
last year is the fastest to date. Celebrities who
.won include Trident, Carlyon, Lochiel, Havoc,
Bobadil, La Carabine, Great Scot. In 1912 Prize-
fighter and Saxonite dead-heated for first and
divided. T\venty--eight of the 52 Australian Cups
have been won by runners carrying less than Bst.
Australian Jockey Club (Sydney) has
decided not to cut down the prize-money for the
big handicaps and classic races of the 1915-16 racing
season. The financial condition of the A.J.C. is.
strong enough to guarantee horse-owners that war
troubles will not cause them to bo offered bread
and dripping instead of scones and butter for a
while yet, at any rate.
Newcastle (N.S.W.) Jockey Club’s prize-
money last year totalled £10,295, of which the Cup
was allotted £2500. The public shelled out £14,113
in gate money, while bookmakers and jockeys’ fees
brought in £3929. On the year’s income of
£22,753 a profit of £7061 was made. Assets stand
at £50,235; but £42.337 of that: is fixed in race-
course and buildings.

At Ilosehill (Sydney) last Saturday, in
the Parramatta Mile, the beast that was made a
hot favorite came nowhere. His name was Ruinall,
so the crowd couldn’t say it wasn’t warned.
On Saturday at Wanganui (M.L.) a
record for the Loanly Islands was credited to Master
Lupin over the If miles. He hoofed it in 3min.
0 3-ssec. It’s a long way behind the world’s top
speeds for the distance, but it knocks out Milan’s
time of Smin. 1 l-ssec. on the same course in 1910.
WALTER REEKS , a Sydney yachting man
and boat architect.
On Saturday, a I Melbourne, the light-
weight championship of Australia passed from the
keeping of Meliegan into the custody of McCoy.
The battle went 13 rounds and at that stage there
was only one capable fighter in the ring. Nobody
knew it better than Mehegan, and he pulled down
his flag and surrendered after a hard gruelling. At
the close of the sixth round it was clear that
McCoy, who was fighting above himself, would win,
bar a mistake that would open the line to a knock-
out. But he left no such chance. He blocked with
care and piled punishment points up with coolness
and judgment, wary always of the uncomplimen-
tary right of the champion. It has to be said that
Mehegan was a dispirited man before entering the
ring. Death had visited one of his family and
its shadow vested in his corner throughout the
fight. Undoubtedly the new champion will have
to defend the title under challenge from the ex-
holder.
Saturday night’s unpleasantness at Syd-
ney Stadium between Les Darcy and Frank Loughrey
drew an enormous crowd of sightseers. They got
their money’s worth. Such was the course of the
battle that the average spectator will smack his
not very fastidious lips over the recollection thereof
for a long time to come. Others who wit-
nessed the affair will remember at least one
of its features. Not often is a man seen iu take so
liberal a dose of punishment with such indomitable
courage as Loughrey displayed from the first round
of this controversy to the last. Darcy had the pull
in weight (list. 61b. to the other’s lOst.
91b.), height and reach, as well as in skill, speed and
power. He began with rather more confidence —
certainly with more coolness—than in previous
engagements; he hit hard, quickly and often, not
as a boxer hits, but in the manner of one to whom
the distribution of biff is a natural accomplishment.
The first round showed enough to convince most
people sitting round the ring that Darcy was master
of the situation, and in all probability Loughrey
was first to realise what was likely to happen. Any-
how, he tried hard to bring matters to an early
conclusion,' and took many risks and jolts in the
effort to achieve his purpose. In the second round
a hard, wicked right to the jaw rubbed the smile off
Darcy’s countenance with great suddenness. When
it showed up again fitfully in the fourth, Loughrey,
with a chop on the same place, rubbed it off some
more. But practically every round was Darcy’s,
and up to the tenth he repeatedly 7 met the advancing
Loughrey with a pile-driving right in the ribs and
left and right to the face, all delivered with a vim
sufficient to break down the resistance of anv but a
man of iron frame and resolution.
As it turned out, the only way of settling Loughrey
completely is with a hammer and cKlsel; and as
Darcy hadn’t been provided with these implements
the rugged American kept on coming back for more.
’This he got in such full measure that by the four-
teenth round he was as completely beaten as a man
could possibly be without being actually 7 unconscious.
So dazed was be indeed that at times he could only
dimly have known what was going on, and the tight
could very 7 profitably have been stopped at this stage.
It is not pleasant to see a beaten man completely
broken, and such a spectacle becomes additionally
distasteful when the loser has shown such a brave
front as Loughrey did. However, whether it be
that Darcy was confused by Loughrey’s continuous
crowding in for shelter, or whether he had actually
got tired of punching him, or, possibly—what is
quite reasonable to suppose-—-he knew he was the
winner and could refrain from doing- his worst on his
weakened enemy 7 —whether, because of one or a com-
bination of all these things, the fact is that Darcy’s
aggressiveness became comparatively merciful towards
the end. Had he straightened his left and kept the
clinging Loughrey away for half a minute, the k.o.
could have been easily 7 delivered. But be
didn’t, and Loughrey, who had skipped to bis
corner after every torrid round and sprung joyfully
back to resume hostilities, saw the troublous journey
through. Darcy won by a big margin, and was
vigorously applauded. For Loughrey there were
generous cheers.

N.S.W. Minister for Health Flowers flew
off the handle last Saturday at the Agricultural
Ground, Sydney, during a carnival which had as
part of the show a baseball competition. No suffi-
cient safety net had been rigged behind the batting
plate, with the inevitable result that a couple of
hot balls were deflected into a crowded stand. The
first one struck a woman on the head without seri-
ously 7 injuring her, and the second punched into a
man’s shoulder. At that stage the excited politician
dashed into the field and exclaimed : “Stop this silly
game.” Of course, the stoppage was applied imme-
diately. If the Minister for Health meant that it
was a silly game to let the balls shoot into the spec-
tators, he was correct. If he meant that baseball
was a condemned silly pastime, he was articulating
through his collar. ’Ball, when skilfully played,
is one of the fastest and most exciting of games.
It is also one of the most trying in its demand
upon play 7 ers for their resource, speed, fore-
thought and endurance. No doubt the estimable
elderly leader of the House of Dodery will be sur-
prised to learn this, lust as Tiie Bulletin would
be surprised if it learned that Mr. Flowers had
the faintest inkling as to the meaning of “triple-
play,” a “trapped ball,” a “pop-up fly ball,”
“battery errors,” “Chicagoing” a team, and a
“whitewash.” In fact, it would be astonished if
it was assured that the patron of League football
knew anything whatever about baseball.

Maoriland has just had its record wood-
chopping match, at Gisborne. For some time past
the supporters of F. Wilson, claiming to represent
Tasmania, and J. Amos, of Maoriland, have been
walking round each other, sniffing, and when arrange-
ments were clinched, and £2OO fixed as the stake,
excitement in log-surgery raged throughout M.L. A
15-inch standing white pine block was used, and
both men carved through as if the butt were merely
frozen soap. Wilson, a stylish athlete, was the
winner. He whittled his little lot in lmin. 7 3-ssec.

South Australians show up astonishingly
well in Sheffield Shield averages, in Shield matches
Clem Hill has pride of place amongst them in
batting. He was boss in 1895-6 (61.83), 1897-8
< 52.42), 1898-9 (62.75), 1900-1 (103.66). 1901-2
(44), 1903-4 (59.16), 1904-5 (48.16), 1906-7
(46.50), 1907-8 (93), 1909-10 (152.25—the best
.vet), 1913-14 (46). George Giffen and D. R. A.
Gehrs stand next in prominence, each three times on
top—-GiffeiL 1892-3 (58.50), 1893-4 (75.14), 1902-3
(74.66) Gehrs, 1905-6 (59.33), 1908-9 (54.33).
1910-11 (69.20). C. E. Pellew wins in 1914-15
with 35.87. The name oftenest on top in the bowling
averages is that of fast bowler E. Jones —1893-4.
20.47 ; 1895-6, 18.04: 1896-7, 17.96; 1897-S.
20.42 ; 1898-9, 26.87. After him George Giffen —
1892-3, 23.71; 1894-5, 17; 1899-00, 27.25 : 1902-3.
17.18. A. W. Wright, who is the beacon this year
(1914-15), with an average of 26.81, was the star in
1905-0 ( 26.66) and in 1906-7 (19.68).
Gordon Campbell, the young lawyer-nephew
of S.A.’s Chief Justice Way. had his first taste of
captaincy in the final Shield match with Vic., the
team electing him in preference to Mayne, who had
led lately 7 . He did the job efficiently, as well as
making most runs for his side and keeping wickets
brilliantly.

The 1914-15 Sheffield Shield matches were
a triumph for bowlers, with left-handed Ironmonger
(Vic.) shining as the brightest star. His 32 wickets
were got at an average cost of 17.12 runs. Fifty-one
bowlers were used by the three States, and only-
four centuries were scored in the series of games—
by Ryder and Park (Vic.), Bardsley (N.S.W.), and
Steele (S.A.).

This was the 59th year of contest on the
cricket field between N. S. Wales and Vic. The
first test was made in March, 1866, at Melbourne,
and added to the pomp and pride of Ma. who won
by three wickets. The struggle was induced by a
challenge from Vic., published in the Argus, to play
for a. stake of £5OO. This undue enthusiasm met
with a reproval from Ma, who said she would put
a head on Vic. for honor's sake, but not for sordid
cash. It was eventually- fixed up that way, and the
Southern State was £5OO in pocket on the deal.
N.S.W. colt Callaway’s performance of
207 against Queensland goes on the slate as the most
profitable “first appearance” in Australian first-class
cricket. The previous record belonged to Les Py-c
(also against Queensland, in 1897). The record
“first appearance” of an Australian on English soil
belongs to H. 11. Massie, who amassed 206 against
Oxford University in 1882.
* * ' * #
Callaway knocked up 129 in the match
between Victoria and N.S.W. colts last season. He
is a member of a well-known Paddington cricketing
family, of whom the best known was Syd, once of
the Australian eleven, although he was never selected
to go to England. Other Callaways have figured in
Sydney cricket, and one is a well-known umpire.

North Sydney, with 66.66 points, is still
at the top of Sydney’s First-grade Cricket Competition.
Western Suburbs, with 64,81, is second ; Waverley.
62.96, is third. Then follow Gordon (57.40), Syd-
ney (55.55), Balmain (51.66), Glebe, (50), Central
Cumberland and Petersham (46.29), Paddington
(41.66) Redfern (28.33) and Middle Harbor —but'
spare its blushes. The end of the competition is in
oght, but the winning colors are obscure.
The bright forget-me-not on the bowling creases
in Sydney’s First-grade Cricket on Saturday was
Hopkins, of North Shore, who reaped five Padfling-
ton wickets for 20 runs in 14 overs. Other examples
of how to do it were Scott, of Petersham, with five
for 42, against Middle Harbor; Dive, of Western
Suburbs, who bagged five Gordon bats for 44 ; and
Best, of Central Cumberland, who shattered the
pickets of three Balmain defenders for 19. The
vigor of Wheatley, of Gordon, was the feature of the
day’s batting. Of the 106 he made in 85 minutes,
64 were compiled four at a smack. He offered only-
one chance throughout and was going strong when
Time snuffed out Opportunity. Another century
(105) not out was made against Waverley by Rix,
of Redfern. He gave no chance and was 92 minutes
at the place of business. Another energetic wood
merchant was Clark. For Petersham he dealt it out
to Middle Harbor to the tune of 95 in 4200 seconds.
Sixty-six of the runs were made by 12 wallops tor
four and three whangs for six. Jones, of Balmain,
who scored 91 off the Central Cumberland bowling,
gave a. display of all-round batting calculated to
keep any audience awake.

111 Melbourne district cricket, tlie compe-
tition is narrowing towards the semi-final games.
Of the four teams to be left in to scramble for the
Pennant, three —Melbourne, Pralian and East Mel-
bourne —are assured of places. The fourth lies
apparently between Norths and St. Kilda.
Melbourne club’s coup, bowler Ironmonger, con-
tinues on his devastating way. On Saturday, against
Richmond, he mowed down six for 31 in 15 overs,
the rest of the wreckage was debited to the veteran
Armstrong, who, in the innings of 88, got three
for 15. Another stinging attack was made b\
Blackie, for Prahan, against University. When he
had concluded his impious labors he had ended
seven young lives for a trifle of 43 runs. Close up
to him in deadliness was Cannon, lie shot five
Collingwooders for 41. There was nothing like-
leather in Melbourne on Saturday.
After exasperating postponements owing
to weather faults, the controllers of N.S.W. amateur
cycling were able to decide two championship races
at Sydney 7 Sports Ground on Saturday evening. 8.
Burtinshaw again won the half-mile and mile race-,
iu lmin. 2 4-6 sec., and 2min. 10 2-ssec. respectively.
G. Halpin was second in the half-mile and A. Taylor
third. The finish for the mile was a yell-raising
affair, out of which Burtinshaw slogged his steed
home by a front leg. S. Goodhew was second and
.1. Halpin third. Earlier in the week the five-mile
State championship was won after a hard race and
a nice exhibition of timing by Aubrey Taylor. A
wheel separated him from second man, E. T. Byron,
who, in turn, just pipped A. A. Patrick. The ex-
cursion occupied llmin. 25 4-ssec. The next im-
portant amateur racing will take place on March (i
and 9 at Sydney. The Australasian championship
scurries will be the sauce of the meeting.
C. A. Piercey, of Australia, and a winner
of the Warrnmnbool Road Race, is having bad luck
in U.S.A. In each of the Six Days’ races in which
lie has competed he has had a smash up and been
badly injured.

Following what is becoming the universal
practice, the Victorian Golf Association has decided
to abandon the State championship and Pennant
matches during the war, and not to sanction any
dates for open meetings in the coining season.
* * * *
N.S.W. bowlers have reached the final
stages of four of the B and 0 Pennant competi-
tions, the champion single-handed and Rink games.
The City Club leads in the two last-mentioned
events .with two finalists in each, and also looks to
have more than an even-money chance of capturing
the Premier flag. This club has, so far, moved on
without a loss and could afford to lose the re-
maining sectional games without being deposed from
the position of divisional winners. City is the
club that has the reputation of- being composed
principally of the malcontents of other institutions,
which is further .evidence of the ancient and reli-
able philosophy that the discontented make for
the progress of the world.

South Park sprung a change on the face
of Adelaide bowling for the Pennant Championship
on Saturday when its representative* won the final
from Victoria Drive by 106 to 98. .It is the first
occasion since the Pennant was up. lor competition
that either Adelaide Oval or Victoria Drive has not
returned with the bacon.

Owing to the death of W. M. Gordon.
until recently Sydney City Surveyor, Australian
bowling greens were not so light-hearted last week.
He was a very popular trundler and a zealous sup-
porter of the welfare of the ancient game. In
every State he was known; and where “Billy"
Gordon was there were no doldrums.
C. Welson (Auckland) and C. Atkinson
(Canterbury) made a big splash in the Maoriland
Amateur Swimming Championships at Napier. Wel-
son won the 440yds., half-mile and mile events, and
was between the first and third men in the 100yds.
and 220yds. Atkinson showed the way home iu the
100yds. and 220yds. (any 7 style) and in the 100yds.
and 200 metres (breast stroke). Also, he arrived
second in the 440yds. and half-mile. Malcolm
Champion’s retirement was a factor in this scoop.
Six districts were represented in the Valdhurst
Shield contest. Auckland won with 35 points:
Canterbury 7, 28 points, second.

The sex’s M.L. swimming record for
100yds. was lessened at the Napier carnival by
3 3-ssec. The time now stands at 80 2-ssec. Mi'-
11. Fai'quhar, of Auckland, was responsible for the
breakage. Another M.L. record established was
3min. 0 3-ssec. for the 200 metres (breast stroke).
Atkinson swam the distance in 3min. 0 2-ssee,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the course of a few weeks a fine company of
local footballers will be in active training for the
front.' —Melbourne war news.
Now forth the fierce footballer goes.
Inspired with patriotic phlegm,
In colored sweater and in hose
To battle with his country’s foes,
And kick the stuffing out of them.
Alas for Kaiser William’s lot —
They’ll just get what the umpires got.
We see the muddied regiment
Arrayed as for the winter game;
But, dropping rules, they are content
To fight all-in against the gent
Responsible for sword and flame.
They’ll “rabbit,” and they’ll butt and trip,
With inch-long spikes their boots equip.
Now let their followers be found,
And stuck into a uniform,
And trained to swell a fearful sound
The loathly other side to hound
Amid the battle’s stress and storm.
In pity’s name, dispatch to war
Of barrackers an army corps!

After 14 Hours in the Queensland Park
Saddle as Fresh as a Daisy.
"2-^IA
“1 got this saddle from
WALTHER & STEVENSON. 1
liked it when 1 saw it in their
Catalogue, but I like it better
now. Just look at the comfort-
able shape of the seat, and take
notice of the narrow waist. The
eat is pigskin, and the skirt
xtends all round. The tree is
strongly plated—nothing to go
wrong there. The shape of the
knee-pads is a strong recommend-
ation, and the leather jxdnts to
the panel, instead of bulky pad-
ding down the sides, give a chap
the chance to ‘feel’ the horse
under . him, and riding is a
pleasure. The flaps are long, and
so are the girth straps, and with
the short folded leather girth
buckling below the flaps there is
no uncomfortable lump under the
rider’s leg. The people who built
this . saddle know what’s what.
The fittings that go with it are a
short folded leather girth, solid
nickel stirrups and bevelled
leathers. I paid X 5/18/6 for
the turnout, and it didn’t cost
me a bean for freight. The firm
sends the saddle freight free for
cash to any port or railway
station in N. S. Wales, and to
any direct port in Queensland,
Victoria, S. Australia, New Zea-
land, Tasmania or Fiji.

The Return of
Tulle to Fashion.
q Tulle is so soft, so delicate, so
dainty, so feminine in its loveliness —it imparts
such youthful appearance to the wearer —that
nothing could stem the tide of its return to
popularity.
<1 When buying Tulle do not be content merely
to ask for “Rainproof Tulle” —say “‘Dy-
namo’ Rainproof Tulle, please,” and look for
the name on the card on which the Tulle is wound.
This is important, because even a mist will
nvb
ruin the most expensive ordinary
Tulle; but ‘‘Dynamo’’ is
waterproof. When wet }ou
simply shake it until dry. It
immediately regains the appear-
ance it had when new.
“Dynamo” Rainproof Tulle does not stick
to the fingers when handled. Its fresh crispness,
its lustre and beauty of colouring are not
impaired by exposure to the strongest sunlight,
and it never becomes tender or limp.

SYMPTOMS of KIDNEY TROUSLE
ARE YOU IN DANGER THROUGH
IGNORANCE?
Nearly all of our readers suffer from aches:
and pains of some kind at one time or
another. Aches and pains very often mean,
kidney troubles. Such symptoms as consti-
pation, backache, improper action of the
bowels, pains in muscles and points, nasty
taste in the mouth first thing in the morning,,
swelling of the feet, cloudy urine, a general
feeling of weakness and irritability, back-
ache, all these are symptoms of kidney
trouble.
They are caused by the poisonous acid in.
the blood which the kidneys should remove,
but they do not owing to their being in a.
weak state.
To cure kidney trouble of any kind, you
must positively get rid of the cause —the
poisonous Uric. Acid. Remember, to do this,
a real remedy must pass through the kidneys
and the bladder, and not through the bowels:
as most kidney pills do. When you see the
urine change to a muddy, bluish color —a.
feature which distinguishes De Witt’s Pills
from all others —you know beyond all doubt:
that they have put their healing touch on
the right spot—the kidneys and the bladder.
A wonderful pill—straight to the kidneys—
that is the reason why De Witt’s give such
amazingly quick relief every time. A per-
manent cure follows in almost every case.
DE WITT’S KIDNEY and BLADDER PILLS
can be obtained at any of the branches of
Washington H. Soul, Pattinson & Co. Ltd.,
Sydney; Longmore’s The Melbourne Phar-
macy, Bourke Street, Melbourne; and all
leading chemists at 2s. 9d. and ss. 6d. per
large box. The ss. 6d. size is two and a half
times as large as the 2s. 9d. size, and con-
tains enough doses to last you three weeks.
Try your nearest chemist, but if you have
any difficulty in obtaining De Witt’s Pills
send the price of the package required tO'
either of the firms mentioned above, and the
goods will be sent by return, post free.*
A -secret that Never Fails to
Grow Hair.”
TOILET TALKS.
DISTRESSING lack of hair will mar
the most beautiful face, and after all
there is really no need to have poor or im-
poverished hair if a few common-sense rules
are observed. First of all, hair tonics must
be freshly made in order to obtain the best
results, and thousands of women, and men,
too, are now making up their own lotions
with most satisfactory results. For this
purpose they obtain from the chemist’s one
chemists. It consists of small granules
which, when mixed with a cup of hot water,
make the most charming mixture imaginable
for shampooing the hair. According to the
quantity used, so the strength is graduated to
suit all conditions. There is one drawback,
however, and that is stallax can only be
obtained in ilb. tins, which cost about
half-a-crown, but as this quantity is suffi-
cient to make 25 to 30 shampoos it is
ounce of boranium and mix this
with 1-pint of bay rum, quite a
simple formula, and according to
all accounts remarkably effec-
tive. This simple, home-made
lotion quickly removes all dan-
druff, and creates a growth of
new, healthy hair which will
gladden the heart of any woman.
One word in conclusion. Do
not experiment with your hair,
long suffering though it may be.
Nature will surely revolt if you
continue to subject the hair and
scalp to all kinds of fanci-
ful treatments. Employ a tonic
by all means if such is required,
but, having found a satisfactory one, use no
other.
NOW about shampoos. Is it reasonable
to expect that one particular make will
suit everybody? Certainly not. Some folks
have dry and brittle hair, others have tresses
which are excessively greasy. Each requires
a different grade of shampoo, if one is to
obtain the best results. The writer’s notice
was recently brought to a substance called
Ktallax, which can be obtained from most
nvb
really very economical in the
end. It leaves the hair a little
too wavy and fluffy for some
tastes, but this can always be
avoided by rubbing a little olive
oil on the scalp previous to
its application.
A FEW remarks on fact>
creams may not be out of
place, and, at the risk of being
put down as a little old-fash-
ioned, my advice on this subject
is to leave well alone. Do not clog
the pores with greasy concoctions
which not only prevent the skin
from performing its proper func-
tions, but usually result in en-
corn-aging a growth of hair on the fact, and
you know very well what, that means —disfig-
urement for the rest of your natural days. If
it is necessary to use an emollient at all, get
some mercolised wax from your chemist and
apply in the usual way. This remarkable
substance seems to absorb ' the worn and
weatherbeaten outer cuticle, and in a few days’
time the new, healthy skin underneath peeps
forth in all its brilliance, and is, of course,
quite free from imperfection or blemish. [IJ

The Inky Way.
Wellington (M.L.) Post, founded in 1865
by Henry Blundell, a comp., and David
Curie, jubileed this month in a supplement
of many pages. The venture was a tottery
one, and Curie sold out to his partner after
six months. Blundell lived 12 years longer,
and then died while on a visit to Sydney,
leaving his sons a property well on the up
grade. Aided by luck and the opportunity
naturally presented in a town of rapid
growth, and always controlled with 15
shrewd eyes on the main chance, the Post
developed into one of the most profitable
newspaper enterprises in all Maoriland. Of
the seven editors who have rumbled the
thunder six are dead —Anderson, Luckie,
Rous-Marten, Gillon, Purnell and Gifford.
Good old Gresley Lukin, formerly of Brisbane
Courier, paces the quarter-deck these days
with measured step. As a newspaper, the
Post is rather unenterprising, very careful,
always reliable, and on the whole decidedly
fair. As an “organ” it is judicial and very
rond of fantasies in the minor key. There’s
a fine job on the premises, ye ken.

Years ago a well-known Methodist parson
named Butters died in England. A Sydney
paper, misreading the cable announcing the
death, thought it referred to J. S. Butters,
ex-mayor of Melbourne, and wrote his
obituary accordingly. Walking along Col-
lins-street and meeting the Melbourne man,
a friend exclaimed: “Hulloa, not dead f Well,
I’ll swear I’ve read your obituary notice —
and a fine appreciation it was, too.”
Together they hunted up the paper, and
old J. S. Butters chuckled to read what a
good man he had been. Then he sat down
and sent the following telegram to the editor:
“Have come back. Climate too hot. Your
friends expect you soon.”
It is not often that a chief-of-staff on a
daily dies worth the £15,800 at which Rex
Thomas’s estate has been sworn in Ade-
laide. The explanation is that, being one
of the Kyffin Thomas family who founded
the now-venerable Register, he was part
proprietor as well as leader of staff.

The birth-notice of a newspaper:—
Born at sea, aboard Troopship A4O, on Monday,
January 4, 1915, Honk ! the Voice of the Benzine
Lancers, and Organ of the Gear-Box Musicians
otherwise the Divisional Ammunition Park
attached to the Australian Expeditionary
Force now in Egypt. The Park consists
wholly of motor-driven waggons ; hence the
affectionate reference to benzine, by which
the force is moved spiritually and
materially. The little 10-page paper is
extraordinarily well printed by G. H. Vin-
cent and edited by Corporal Phil Harris, of,
Sydney. The first issue was got out on the
promenade deck of the transport with the
assistance of the engineers and electricians.;
Tooting merrily in the battle-line, Honk is

Under an illustration alleged to be
of a Russian military hospital scene,
published in a Sydney paper, there is letter-
press to carefully explain that “In the pic-

photographed washing a patient with a pair
of forceps, or combing his whiskers with a
poultice, the war would end in a week.
COBWEBS ON YOUR HAT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I'd been fooling round the garden in a Sunday-
morning style,
And I'd come inside to drown a thirst and rest a
little while;
For, when people get their living by reposing in a
chair
And inditing minor poems, raking soil bedews the
hair
With the mushy sweat of labor —sweat the pen can
never raise—
So the poet in his garden works in feeble, fitful
ways.
Left alone, I would not garden but a wife must be
obeyed,
Though I hold a man does better by perspiring at
his trade.
I’d been crawling round the roses very humbly on
my knees,
And the dust I there encountered made me cough
and pant and sneeze ;
Very dusty was the garden, for the weather had
been dry,
And the garden spiders’ cobwebs shone like burn-
ished bridges high ;
But I raked and dug and weeded, till the bucket I
kept near
Was filled up with grass and rubbish and the frag-
rant mould was clear;
Then, well-warmed by sunny labor, in a shady place
I sat,
And discovered at my leisure there were cobwebs on
my hat.
Now my conscience often troubles as I sit inside
and write
From the morning to the evening by a dim electric
light;
Of the whole wide world I scribble in a cocksure
way and vain,
Though my personal horizon is the wall across the
lane;
And I have a dim suspicion it would be a dreadful

Any shareholder who can look clown that
table and smile must be an optimist—
unless lie chuckles at the thought of the
good times the co. lias had. Moreover, last
half-year’s profit is, with oue exception, the
lowest in tlie table. Allowance certainly
must be made for tlie shocking year that
Victoria has been through; but even ou the
figures of the few previous years there is
nothing to be joyful about. The average
profit is less tliau it was five years back.
One trouble is that, up till a few years
ago, when the co. was the only pebble on
the beach, it paid away, year after year,
more than it earned net. There was nothing
to be afraid of —it had accumulated a fairly
respectable reserve, and as the coast was
clear the shareholders had a good time. Then
came the usual electrical competitor, and
the dividend column tc4ls part of the story.
This table tells more of it :
Dec., ’O9. June, ’l4. Dec., ’l4.
Assets apart from plant
and meters .. £9862 £11,830 £11,421
Liabilities ... .. 781 3,644 2,985
Surplus .. £9078 £8,186 £8,436
So the co. has £642 less cash, etc., than it
had five years ago, although one half-year no
div. at all was paid, and latterly only 8 p.c.
During the past six months it lias certainly
pulled up a bit: but that is mostly because
of the uncommonly small amount paid out
on account of meters and stoves and muni-
cipal rates. After providing for a normal
expenditure, it is quite clear that the co.
will have all its work to do to maintain tlie
8 p.c. dividend.

This is the poor relation among Australian
gas cos. Nothing but a string of 4 p.c.’s
to mark performances since 1896, and noth-
ing better in sight. Even the 4 p.c. allows
of a margin that seldom exceeds £2OO after
allowance has been made for depreciation;
and the profit thus written off is invariably
absorbed in repairs or in extensions which
don’t add materially to the. net revenue.
The trouble is the competition of municipal
electricity, generated for next to nothing by
the Esk River, complicated with a debenture
debt. Liabilities (mostly these debentures)
amount to £84,905, and assets, excluding
plant, buildings, etc. (£82,567), and such
like fixtures, amount to £13,708. Five years
ago the same items were £38,422 and £16,426
respectively, so there has been a net improve-
ment of £794 in five years. Not much ; but
anyhow, as meantime some extensions must
have been paid for, the co. appears to be
holding its own, even if its own is very
modest.
The Q. N. Bank, besides providing for
issues of further share capital, has another
scheme on hand. It proposes to turn its
pastoral assets over to a separate co. What
practical difference this will make at once
depends on the valuation of the assets trans-
ferred to the new co. If the latter takes
them at their present book value, the bank's
balance-sheet totals will not be affected;
there will simply be among the assets so
much representing “shares in other cos.”
and a corresponding amount less among the
“advances and properties.” But if there is
any increase in the valuation, nominal profits
will be made equal to the amount of tlie
writing-up; and that may enable the direc-
tors to increase the cash repayments to old •
depositors—the repayments on which tin'
resumption of dividends depends. It is
pretty certain, anyhow, that the scheme isn't
designed to prolong the shareholders’ agony.
This will mean that the six years or so
which it was hitherto reckoned it might be
before the first payment was made will
probably be cut down more or less.

They keep things humming at Cathcart
Central. Ararat (Vic.), and another divi-
dend of Is. is reported. This will make
21s. per share forked out to originals like
Reilly and McCrorey. As tlie co. is now
working beyond the crab-hole south of the
shaft, the retiyn of 21s. represents flu l gifts
the gods have sent from a little over 2000 ft.
of gutter. The present dividend will shrink
cash resources to £2OOO. apart from what
will come In from the puddlers meanwhile.
No oue hears whether the co. will need
capital for driving its deep under-level, or
whether a new shaft will be wanted for the
lower section of the lead in the claim. Ali
that anybody seems to care about is that
good stuff is being got in the farthest work-
ings; south-west off No. 9 rise tlie wash
samples up to 3oz. per fathom. But notice
you are never told the width of the run of
gold in the gutter!
Al. Gaffney’s (Vic.), is making history
very pleasantlv up in the mountains. The
theory about Woods Point mines was that
nr, depth the reefs in the dykes would not be
profitable, as the conditions under which
the magma would cool would not make for
extensive shoots of quartz. At the Al,
however, between Nos. 8 and 10 levels the
pick has disclosed live floors, some small,
some of decent size, but taken together of
sufficient area to furnish a neat little
reserve for the battery. Stone is going down
below No. 10 level,-so the prospects of more
floors being opened up are cheery. To test
this another 150 ft. of sinking is to be done.
The average of the stone broken round No. 9
level is close on an ounce. Mine expenses
are high, absorbing over Bdwt. per ton ; but
the scheme is to put in mere air and battery
power, and with the aid of a suction gas
plant to cheapen costs. If successful, Fred
Dickenson’s fathering of the Al, after the
ending of John Bull’s ownership, should
open the road for aid to those who want the
old heroes of Woods Point tested at depth.
All the “specimens" are not gone yet. Two
members of the Maryborough (Vic.) Metho-
dist Church, while walking prayerfully home
from chapel on a recent Sabbath, picked up
a nugget in the main street, and next day
got fit) for it.
Mount Oxide (Q.) is doing little or
nothing except shaft-sinking. The idea is
really to ascertain whether there is enough
ore to justify the building of 00 miles of
railway line. (The Gulf line, once again
talked of, might cut that down by-
about half.) The scheme for an amalgama-
tion of Cloncurry interests has by no means
been abandoned. Mount Elliott, which has
money, but not much of a mine; Oxide,
which has something of a mine, but not
much money ; and the Freeholds, which have
a pull, will probablv be swept into the one
basket.
Papuan Brilliant and Victoria, Charters
Towers, crushed 229 tons for an average
of £9 4s. 9d., which follows 270 tons for an
average of £l3 3s. 7d. in December. Includ-
ing the 3d. distributed on the 24tlv, a total
of £9600 has been paid, which is equal bo
2s. per share. Tlie Papuan was lucky in
picking up a cross reef when it had worked
out some of the best stopes on the Moon-
stone ; for this cross reef, although small,
carries prill ore in the shaft below the deep-
est level. With a reef from 4in. to Gin. at
the bottom of the underlay, the stone will
require to be rich to pay many dividends,
and a slump in the market is certain if
a blank is met with. In a mine subject to
rapid changes it is only safe to buy when
face prospects are poor.

The mining managers of Bendigo devoted
half their annual banquet to eating and the
other half to dismissing the causes of the
decline in local gold mining. The president
said that in 1910 there were 184 mines at
work on the field, and calls amounting to
£119,000 were made. In 1914 but 118 mines
were working and the calls totalled only
£62,000. Instead of the Government wasting
money subsidising small parties of men to
prospect, it ought, lie thought, to
liberally help existing companies with
plants on known lines of reef. An
ex-president blamed the Workmen’s Com-
pensation Act and the rates of insur-
ance. Another blamed the No-Liability Act;
capital should be put down in a lump sum
at the beginning of operations. , Nobody
blamed the Almighty for not putting more
nlums into the Bendigo pudding. Yet that
is the biggest trouble, after all.

Talisman Consolidated (M.L.) has
declared a dividend of 2s. Last year it
crushed 52,210 tons for £263,516, and to
the end of 1914 £2,363,261 had been pro-
duced and £965,534 paid in dividends. Costs
total 435. 7d. per ton —mining 145., milling
12s. Id., general 2s. Bd.. and development
14s. lOd. That development should be the
biggest item isn’t surprising, for the reef is
very patchy and often a narrow streak.
Malaya Tin Corporation, in whose inter-
ests T. 11. Martyn, a well-known N.S.W.
dredging man. went to Siam, claims a net
profit of £20,033 for its first year; but
whether that amount will materialise in cash
depends on the Ratrut Basin Co., in which
the corporation holds 35,135 shares. _ So far
it is a paper profit. Ratrut Basin is push-
ing on its preparations to start dredging.
Other concessions are in hand, but the
directors don’t think it wise to give results
of preliminary boring. Apart from the co.’s
cash and share interest in Ratrut, the M.T.
Corporation is very much that way: its bank
credits, run to only £1584.

mixing of a lot of its low-grade with its high-

than 23 p.c. phosphoric acid. "Crushing
machinery must, however, be provided before
the stuff can be marketed retail, and a mill
should be running in March. The show is
opening up better than Mines officials ex-
pected, and the manager estimales 40 to 50
thousand tons “immediately available,” at a
cost of 7s. a ton.

A Bio Test. — At the official opening of the Broken
Hill Proprietary Co.’s new iron-ore plant at Hummocky
Hill (S.A.), the Giant Dunlop llubber Conveyor
Belt — 4875 feet long, 36 inches wide, 5-inch thick —-
loaded 2800 tons of ironstone into a steamer at the
rate of 800 tons an hour, the actual loading time
being 3$ hours —a record for Australia. In connec-
tion with the loading, it is interesting to note that,
with the Dunlop Conveyor, one man can load 500'
tons, of ore per hour, as against 30 tons per hour
by the old method with 40 men employed. The\
speed of the belt was 350 feet per minute, carrying
a continuous load of about 150 tons. The huge
Dunlop Conveyor, weighing over 30 tons, was in
every way a success. It’s the same on every mine
in Australasia where Dunlop Belting and Rubber
Goods are used. They stand alone for quality,
strength, and the long service they consistently
give. Furthermore, they cost, less and give better
results than similar imported goods. Tenders and

ln rep]y t 0 „ Sr-( „ the reason why Australians
continue the idiotic plan of rooting their dwellings
with iron is that they think it is the English custom.
As a matter of fact, iron is only used in England for
quite temporary structures. Shingles are doubtless
a much better material, though tiles also are excel-
lent, and if lined with moss or thick felt are nearly
as impervious to heat. I was the first man to roof
a. house with tiles in N. S. Wales, and by leaving a
wide air space between roof and ceiling- secured
perfect coolness. The best roofing of all for hot
climates is stone, as in Oriental countries. But of
course Australians do not estimate anything- on its
own merits; the only question with them is what
will please or imitate the English. I mean, of
course, the average one who calls a country at the
antipodes, instead of bis own native land, “Home.”

“5 minutes make the

victory and defeat!”
—LORD NELSON
THIS is an age of Petrol. Swift action, swift
transport, will be a deciding factor in the
present titanic upheaval in Europe.
In an important engagement it is easily conceivable
that immortal Nelson’s dictum will be signally
exemplified in the present struggle. Motor-
haulage of field-guns has proved very successful in
manoeuvres. How successful it will be in actual
warfare we are yet to see.
In all questions of motor traction the fuel plays a
vital part.

Pratt’s Spirit for this important work is a significant tribute to its
sheer merit and consistent reliability. Pratt’s also enjoys the
complete confidence of our Allies, who are using it in enormous
quantities.
In Peace as in War, Pratt’s Spirit is the motorist’s first and final

vigorous health. It is the Quick way—because the benefit begins from the first
wineglassful, and increases with every additional wineglassful. The Sure way
—because it has given new health and new life to countless thousands of
sufferers. And because it is recommended by over 10,000 Doctors. The Safe
way—because it contains no drugs. The first effect of “Wincarnis” is an
immediate stimulation and invigoration of the whole system. This is followed
by an actual up-building of bodily vigor—an up-building that you can feel and
which gives you more strength and vitality than you had before. And each
succeeding wineglassful of “Wincarnis” creates still more strength and
still more vitality, until soon your whole body thrills with new health and new
life. Then you can stop taking “"Wincarnis.”
But you can still enjoy to the full the glorious new health it has given you.
That is where

proves itself of enormous advantage oxer drugs and drugged wines. Drugs
stimulate, it is true, but it is false stimulation. And drugs make .you feel worse
afterwards, because they depress the heart. Read what Mr. Edmunds says:
"Dear Sirs, —I am delighted with the new health your world-famed
‘Winearnis’ has given me. I have had such a busy season that I got ‘run-
down.’ I was intensely weak, and quickly got exhausted. I was induced to
take a wine tonic, which unfortunately made me feel worse than ever. I
discovered afterwards that it contained drugs. So I quickly gave it up and
tried ‘Winearnis’ instead. And it is wonderful how speedily ‘Winearnis’ has
made me feel a different being. It seemed to pfit new life into me. I should
never have believed that anything could do me so much good, or do it as quickly
as ‘Winearnis’ has done. I only wish I had tried it before. —Yours faithfully,
‘‘A. S. EDMUNDS, 8-12 Selwyn Road, Cliftonville.”
So you see that the health that ‘‘Winearnis” gives is real and lasting health.
That is the health you want if you suffer from Anaemia, Weakness, Nerves,
Sleeplessness, Exhaustion, Indigestion, or if you are ‘‘Run-down.” And it is
real and lasting health that “Winearnis” offers you. Will you try just one
bottle ?
Begin to get well TO-DAY.
“Winearnis” is made in England by COLEMAN & CO., Ltd., Winearnis Works,
Norwich. You can buy “Winearnis” from any Wine Merchant, Licensed
Chemist, or Grocer, but if you experience any difficulty in obtaining it write
direct to the Sole Distributing Agents, Fassett & Johnson, 5-7 Barrack Street,
Sydney.

stalled on an elaborate scale, which
overcomes Brisbane’s greatest menace.
Proprietor,
T. M. AHERN.
IN
BANANA LAND
“Paddy Melon”: I want to growl. Here
we are with an election coming on and
nobody making a move to get up a general
strike or earthquake or anything else to
spoil the chances of the Labor crowd. But
who’s going to start a National party to give
us the initiative and referendum, so that half
of the jaw-waggers who draw good pay may
be wiped out? We’ve about as much real
use for 72 members of Parliament as a dog
has for a fifth tail.
The Brisbane Tory press, which sadly
wailed not long ago about the ineptitude of
Denham, is now heartily cursing the
harvest of its own sowing. The dissatisfied
members of the Liberal party who lately
voted for the dethronement of Denham have
decided to try the electors in May as “th,e
Farmers’ Union party,” having “no connec-
tion with the so-called Liberals.” The Tory-
press, which can never be anything but Tory*
calls down the wrath of Heaven on these
“vote-splitters” one minute, and proceeds
behind the door to gloomily kick itself the
next. It goes as far as to say: .“A split
Liberal vote is now practically certain, and
a consequent Labor success.” Altogether
the press seems to be bravely preparing itself,
to meet a severe shock to the leading article.
“McNorth”: In detailing the troubles of
Queensland banana growers, “Cleveland”
(B. 14/1/T5) omits any reference to market
antics. Here is a report of prices obtained
in Melbourne by Northern growers for two
days in each of two months last year:—
Bunch. Case.
October I .. .. 3s. 6rl. fia. :6d.
October 2 .. .. Is. 9d. 4s. Od.
November 1 .. .. ss. :od. 14s. Od.
November 2 . . . . 3s. Od. 10s. Od.
The gay young market, which seems so full
of promise and high spirits on the first of the
month, falls with a dull thud of about 50
per cent, on the second. What is the nature
of the disease or earthquake or rebellion or
whatever it is that happens to the Mel-
bourne agents between •closing time on the
first day of the month and opening time on
the second?
“Shovel”:. The recent statement by “Aus-
tralia Jane, that the parents of a child
stricken with infantile paralysis practically
had the alternative of a dead child or a life-
long invalid, requires to be a\ little diluted.
The disease can be cured. Everything
depends on an early and correct diagnosis.
If the " child suddenly loses control of any
of its limbs, don’t waste time with the
general practitioner. He probably knows
nothing about it. Seek the specialist. The
sickness develops faster than a German ulti-
matum. Strangely enough, one of its charr
acteristics is a preference for coinely chil-
dren. In a recent Melbourne case a fine,
active youngster, who showed no previous
sign of illness except a slight feverishness,
lost complete control of her left leg jjj,-a
few hours. Examination by a specialist
indicated paralysis. After 10 days’ treat-.
ment in his hospital the patient returned
home cured. In another 10 days she was
running about.
Recently Brisbane Courier reprinted an
extract from a number 50 years old, wherein
J. G. McDonald’s trip from Port Denison to
the Northern Territory in 1805 was de-
scribed. J. G. McDonald is still to be seen
almost daily in* the streets of Brisbane,
robust and hearty, in spite. of his 80-odd
years. The McDonalds are a .Victorian
family—tough, sinewy and enduring as they
make them. Ten of them are still in the
land of the living —ages ranging from 70 to
about 86. * As specimens of what the Aus-
tralian climate can turn out the clan
.will,take some beating. ;
From the Protector of Aborigines in the
Mackay district:— 4 V 1 . „
My experience here is that the Chinese farmers
who employ aborigines treat them very much better
than most of the white people who employ them.
The Chinese offer better wages and, what is more,
pay their wages when due; they also house and
teed them well.
It doesn’t sound nleasant to white ears;
but, after all, it is only saying that the
Chow cocky is not so mean as the white
cocky—a statement that is probably quite
justified.
OBVIOUSLY UNJUST
INDIGNANT BACHELOR : "D isgraceful this fork of givin' married men a preference over
single men owin' to this 'ere war. How is single coves a-goin’ to hearn their
[?] at all, havin' no wives to send out washin?— that's what I wanler know."
Dear Bulletin, —In reply to “Manx”
(B. 11/2/T5) and his Yankee boring record
of 2119 ft. in three weeks, I instance an
Australian 1100 ft. in 10 days, done at a
spot not 100 miles distant from Belalie
(N,S,W.) in 1892, when -all poles were
used ; also one Christiansen, a “sub” borer,
got out 145 ft. in eight hours with a “kicking’
jenny”,plant. It is not the fast drilling that
counts, however, but the quality of it. Any
duffer can drill a hundred feet a shift in
good cutting. My 3000 ft. a year is a good
average, as “Manx” will find when he knows
a bit more about the business. The impor-
tation of a Yankee oil rig and crew would
not serve any good purpose. I have known
p 0 alleged oil-drillers who have come to
Australia; as regards < practical work, they
knew nothing and had to learn their business
here. No; there’s plenty of energy and
ability in Australia, not only to bore, but
to construct and design plant and tools that
our ’cute cousins never dreamed of. Our
acting hydraulic engineer. Hargreaves, has
gone lion a tour to get the latest informa-
tion re oil drilling, and it is a foregone con-
clusion that he -will bring back a foreign
plant, and probably indent one of these
“crews.” We have to pay the piper, but
then we’ll see some fun. —Yours in glad
anticipation. Queenslander.

QUEENSLAND.
PHILANDER F.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, February 27, 1915.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
The Patriotic Aquatic Carnival this after-
nofbn was held in Mowbray Park, on one of
the prettiest bends of the river, and the pre-
vailing wonder was why other such happen-
ings—notably the Ilenleys of former years —
had not been . billeted there. The Arthur
•Morgans (acting or emergency vice-regals)
and the mayors and mayoresses were thrown
in'as ■ adjuncts to the scenery. The toilers
were the ladies of the sailing and swimming-
clubs. who spent the day accumulating the
ldose cash Which had not already been swept
up into the Patriotic funds. Sailing and motor-
boats, with their pretty decorations, added
to the picturesqueness of the waterfront and
parklands, and a miniature Sydney demol-
ished another Emden with enthusiasm and no
quarter. In the evening the Black and
White Pierrots topped off a good day with a
concert. The financial result isn’t yet an-
nounced, but it should climb into three
figures.
On Wednesday afternoon the new mayor-
ess, Mrs. Down, began her reign by tea-ing
the wives of aldermen and city officials at
Cafe Eschenhagen. This was a good move,
and an unusual one ; and the ladies who have,
or should have, much in common, discussed
plans which their husbands will just have
to take notice of. Mrs. Down wore grey and
white striped silk, with touches of black,
and a plumed hat. Her two daughters, who
helped her to entertain, wore white lingerie
gowns and, pretty summer hats.
,The linen tea in aid of the Brisbane Gen-
eral Hospital was a success. Besides a few
guineas .in cash, a pile of linen and bed mil-
linery cheered up the women responsible for
the good cause. Amy Mills uplifted her con-
tralto voiee during' the afternoon, and Miss
Raymond and Miss Maynard smote the piano
and stroked the violin respectively. Statis-
tics and tea concluded the entertainment.
Eva Webber, a little Brisbane girl with a
promising voice (nothing like the promising
voice of the politician, of course), gave a
concert on Wednesday night. Acting-Ex.
Morgan and his wife and Archbishop Duliig
occupied the seats of the mighty—which are
never half so comfortable or interesting, my
dear, as those of the flighty. The singer, who
wore white, was almost buried beneath
bunches of flowers bestowed upon her by old
school-fellows of All Hallows Convent.
Tessie Mulcahy and her beautiful, creamy
voice, Mabel Sehwabe and her violin, and
Miss Clancy, who “accompanies” delightfully,
also' were notable enough to hush the shuffle
of feet at the back of the hall and still the
whispering tongue of gossip in the front
chairs.
Yesterday aftefnoon the old boys of the
Brisbane Grammar School and the present
Scholars challenged one another with tennis
■ racquet and cricket bat. At the spell-ohs
1 dainty little Mrs. Bousfield provided lunch
and afternoon tea.
Dr. Jean White, who was buried (figura-
tively speaking) in the prickly-pear problem,
has swapped her scientific career for a
matrimonial substitute. Her partner in
the new venture is one Haney, from U.S.A.,
who recently took up land at Dulaeca, ad-
jacent to the prickly-pear experimental sta-
tion. The knot was tied in Melbourne on
Monday last, so that any protest from the
Science Association or Noxious Weeds Coun-
cil is too late to go before the stewards.
The panto, is panting at His Majesty’s
Theatre, and Daisy Jerome’s studious habit
of making artless little speeches breaks out
at the usual frequent intervals. “She
Stoops to Conquer,” which has been drawing
good houses all the week at Palace Gardens,
has made way for "Caste,” in which Lillian
Lloyd and Souper shine.
The East Brisbane Croquet Club held its
annual meeting on Wednesday afternoon,
and onde again rose as one woman and
pushed Mrs. Hetherington into the presiden-
tial roost.
The portfolio which George Appel dis-
carded has descended upon “Ken” Grant,
who once before was close up to the political
footlights. That was in 1911, when he was
made Minister for Public Instruction. He
resigned in September of the following year,
when he found himself at variance with the
Government over his pledge to further the
construction of the railway into the Dawson
Valley coalfield —the Cabinet turned the
line down and Grant turned the Cabinet
down. He has had 13 years in Parliament.
Originally he hailed from Scotland, but as
he has spent most of his life in Rockhampton
that discrepancy has -been waived.
Mrs. McKenzie gave an At Home on Thurs-
day afternoon in honor of her daughter Mrs.
Julian Mackay, who is one of the newest
brides, besides being one of our most popular
pretty girls. I need not tell you, therefore,
that the gathering was large and enthusi-
astic.
The wife of newly-knighted “Bob” Philp
is down in Sydney. As a step-grandmothm
the lady has been putting up a record:
■ within two years she has had the title
bestowed on her on four separate occasions.
As plain Mrs. P. she was one of the women
who worked hard and successfully to estab-
lish, and run on sound financial lines, the
Gynaecological Hospital which Lady Lam-
ington left behind her in Brisbane as a
vice-regal souvenir ten years ago.
Yours affectionately.
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Journalist Brooks, ’ who sent in his last
proofs at Brisbane lately, was the “double”
of Badger, of the trams. During the argu-
ment about the badges Brooks was frequently
hooted in mistake for the real article from
America.
Reported at a meeting of the executive of
the Patriotic Fund at Rockhampton:—
The circular (issued by the committee)’ made
particular mention of one man giving £lOO. Others
had given that amount. One person gave £lOO, and
his wife £5O. They had intended giving more, but
when they saw that only one citizen was mentioned
they took exception to it.
It is still called a Patriotic Fund.
“Joe Mud” : Queensland’s policy is to build
as many miles of railway as possible at the
lowest possible capital cost. What this leads
to is illustrated by the history of the line
which crosses the .Jimbour Plains. Less than
an inch of rain fell, yet the downpour was
sufficient to make the line unworkable. To
get good agricultural and pastoral results
the State wants heavy rain. Its new lines
can stand nothing more than dew. If there’s
only dew the trains have nothing to run
for. Heavy rains mean heavy loads, but the
lines won’t carry them. Light rains mean—
but, there, I’m bogged.
“Cleveland” discovers a problem:—
When the European butchery broke out in August
the Queensland Government hurriedly announced that
no automatic increases of salary could be expected
this year. Though no civil-servants were so dis-
loyal as to say “Dash,” this decision stands part
revoked, as automatic increases are being handed
out in those cases where the advance will not
cause a salary to soar above £lOO per annum. This
looks very well on the surface, but is rotten
underneath ; for the majority of those who will re-
ceive increases are unmarried junior clerks, most
of whom live at home with pa, while numbers of
married civil-servants are struggling to rear
families on salaries ranging from £lOO to £2OO
per annum. If any increments are. justified in the
present tough circumstances it is to the latter class,
when they might have helped to clothe and feed
little Reginald and Gwendoline, , who are parties
entitled to , all the consideration empty Bananaland
can give.
Lately a constable at Melbourne District
Court mislaid a witness, and had to hunt
him up while the case waited. After a
hurried search of precincts and purlieus, the
John found his man, bustled him into court,
and deposited him at the foot of the witness-
box with a whispered but savage “Stand
there, dam’ y’!” audible all over the build-
ing. Then came a sleepy murmur from
“Paddy” Dwyer, the P.M. on the bench,
almost caressing in its tenderness: “Con-
stable ! When you have anything... .for my
private ear.... don’t shout.... like that.”
From the Secretary N.S.W. Public Service
Association
In last Bulletin “Pink Tape Junr.” states
that N. S. Wales public servants cannot
legally complain at having their increments
stopped, as Parliament did not vote the
money. Parliament did vote the money ; £BOOO
was provided for the purpose. Public servants may
therefore have legal redress. When a junior enters
the service he does so on the distinct understanding
that the Government will honor the Public Service
Board’s conditions of employment, one of which is
that the officer’s salary shall advance by annual
increments until £2OO is reached, provided that
he passes various grade examinations. As the Public
Service Board’s regulations are made under the
Public Service Act, they are, or should be, as binding
as* the provisions of the Act itself. Therefore the
suspension of the increments is really a breach of
contract with the juniors in the service. Hence my
association is fighting hard to have the increments
restored.


White
n
Roofs
WHAT do you ask of a roofing material? ■
First, that it shall be dependable —that it will not leak, that it will protect the house or building, and that
such protection will last for the longest possible time.
There are many roofing materials-that are up to such a specification. But add to these other requirements:
that the roofing shall resist the heat of summer and that it will add to the attractiveness of the house —and what
roofing “ fills the bill” ?
Only one—WHITE MAETHOID.
Ask vour Architect what roofing material enables him best to express his ideas, ■ and we think he’ll say :
“WHITE MALTHOID.”
White Malthoid is
the old, tried and
true Malthoid,
plus a coating of
Asbestos; hence
its ability to
resist fire and
summer tempera-
ture, and its
soft, pleasing
appearance.
n
We have many
booklets and

thoid. They con-
tain many illus-
trations of White

afraid it must have been torpedoed. The office is

Edmund W.: We dismissed the Daniel Cupid poem
and threw its umbrella and brown-paper parcels after
it down the stairs. The other poem about the mate
just pitched itself into the basket. It had suicidal

Qogolou”: The Sugar Octopus was quite
upset lately when it learned that there was
a possibility of. the stoppage of Indian immi-
gration to Fiji, the Colonial Office appar-
ently thinking that subjects who bled to
swell the glory of the Empire in time of
trouble, as the Indians are doing, deserved a
better fate than to be bled in Fiji in time of
peace to swell the dividends of a greedy co,
A circular setting forth the evils likely to
befall the C.S.R. in the event of its supply
of Indian labor being cut off was sent round
to the local public bodies, whose assistance
was implored. The Suva Chamber of Com-
merce, whose president is the co.’s local
solicitor, unanimously agreed with the senti-
ments in the circular, and one agitated son of
Abraham remarked that the stoppage of In-
dian labor was more disastrous than the
outbreak of war.. The Planters’ Associa-’*
tion, many of whose members are in h tight
grip, also did a large amount of talk on the
same lines, and finally a motion, proposed
by one Pain (of the gaitered Pain family),
urging the Secretary of State to keep the
cheap nigger traffic moving on to Fiji, was,
of course, carried unanimously.
“Negai Tamona,” from the North
I don t think Bill 11. of Germany would care
about witnessing the enthusiasm with which his
former native subjects of Papua, the Solomons and
the vicinity are welcoming “the perfidious British ”
As a matter of fact, the hardest work our troops
have is to protect the remaining Germans from the
natives, who think that now is the time to get
even with their former tyrants. It looks as though
these places had been predestined to be British.
Wherever the Germans got in touch with the
natives, though they used all sorts of threats and
inducements to make their own language current
they had to resort to pidgin English. Almost th"
first greeting we hear from the natives we visit
is: “Berritani [British], he number one master.
German he altogether no dam’ good. More better
you-me kill ’im finish quick feller.”

According to a N.S.W. decision given last
week, a rubber-stamp facsimile of a signature
is a signature. The case arose out of sum-
monses issued in Sydney by the Industrial
Arbitration Office, “signed” in this way by
a J.P. The magistrate had declined to
recognise the alleged signature, and refused
to hear the cases ; but the higher Court has
issued a mandamus directing him to proceed.
Had the magistrate’s view been upheld, a
vast quantity of Industrial Arbitration pro-
ceedings which were commenced with the
rubber stamp which is now a J.P. would have
been upset.
Willie Watt is a sure gallery actor. At
the big Melbourne recruiting meeting the
other night, Senator Pearce spoke hard, cold
sense; then Willie came on and got all the
applause with his plain and fancy exagger-
ation. British troops have been holding
feet of the Western battlefront, and the
French armies have been holding yards. But
AVillie didn’t mention the French. He just
remarked that Englishmen in their thous-
ands had held back the foe in their millions,
and a fooled audience applauded wildly.
Militant “patriotism” is as easy as lying,
and often indistinguishable from it.
A solemn body calling itself the Christa-
delphian Ecclesia has put up a lecturer in
Melbourne to. prophesy “universal govern-
ment and peace” after the war. The advt. •
gives a very free rendering of the New
Testament—such as “Exit Turkey! Enter
Israel (Revelation xvi, 12)” —and states
that “the leading article of the Aegtjs, Feb.
20 last is in harmony with Scriptural pro-
phecies uttered 2500 years ago.” Further
evidence that Argus politics date from b.c. !
During last week N. S. Wales Premier
Holman several times assured the public that
Carmichael (Minister for Education) had
been working night and day at something or
other unspecified in connection with the
school system. Well, even though Car-
michael is only just back from a long, luxuri-
ous holiday in Europe on full pay
there is no reason why Holman should insist
in this pointed way that his loquacious col-
league occasionally does something to earn
his screw. In fact, it looks as-if. Holman
feared the existence of a suspicion that Car-
michael is blithering so much about rifle
clubs and parsimonious cookery and the
splendid liberality ofj Cohen, that the thing
he’s paid to do is let go hang.
Passed beyond the other day, in Westralia,
James Maguire, made almost famous in 1869
by effecting the escape of John Boyle
O’Reilly from the convict road-gang at
Bunbury. O’Reilly, after his escape, reached
the U.S.A., and by-and-bye became editor of
the Boston Pilot. Maguire arrived in W.A.
in the ’4o’s in the Trusty. The family had
as shipmates the parents of John Forrest.
All his people were farmers, so they settled
on the land at Dardanup, where James
married and died. The escape of O’Reilly
was planned by Father McCabe and put into
execution by Maguire, who rowed the patriot
out to sea in a boat to the American whaler
Gazelle, from which he was transferred to
the Sapphire, and thence found passage to
America.
When candidates for the single appoint-
ment to be made from South Aus. to the
Commonwealth School of Aviation at Point
Cook (Vic.) presented themselves in
Adelaide, they asked each other what pro-
fession or trade had kept them from starv-
ing. Some were motor mechanics, some were
electrical engineers, and so forth. One, who
confessed he had lived every day of 24 years
on a farm at Yorke’s Peninsula and had
worked on it since he could drive a horse-
rake, was unanimously advised to get out, as
the exam, would be stiff and he “couldn’t
have a possible.” He hadn’t mentioned,
however, that all his leisure had been spent
in the study of aviation, making model aero-
nlanes and experimenting off his own bat.
Then the candidates were examined, and the
one who came out on top and was duly
selected was the surprising young man from
the farm, who had easily out-distanced the
rest in practical and theoretical knowledge.
Another bird of passage has flown through
Australia and picked up all the news. When
he got back to Jewhannesberg he fluttered
breathlessly into the Transvaal Leader and
croaked into the confiding ear of the editor :
In Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, he
found thousands out of work. In Sydney the posi-
tion was acute. There 20,000 able-bodied men
were idle, with the total growing daily. These
were mostly depending on the soup kitchens, supplied
by charitable people, for their meals, and with no
prospect of a change for the better.
His name is Brittain and he is a photo-
grapher ; but he didn’t produce a photo-
graph of the legion of unemployed in Sydney,
nor the scenes of famine at the soup em-
poriums. The Bulletin, therefore, hands
out the negative. It’s the only one there is.
On Feb. 15 there were £23,225,243 worth
of Commonwealth notes in circulation, and
the official statement is made that the “ad-
vances out of the issue have yielded
up to the present the sum of £552,335 in
interest.” That is to say, by making use of
our national credit among ourselves, we have
thus far saved ourselves £552,355 of taxation.
From the deputy-corporal (retired list) :
I have ideas of my own about the proper conduct
of modern war. Apparently the scouting war-
’planes can do very little spying when there is mist
or fog; so why not baffle the enemy by manufac-
turing fog when and where required ? My idea
is to have a few companies of lawyers attached to
every brigade. When secrecy is desirable, the law-
yers and their material (wigs, parchment, ink, red
tape, seals, quill pens, law books, green baize
doors and small tables) can be sent forward to
bomb-proof trenches, each of the latter provided
with a small stovepipe in the roof to facilitate the
escape of the legal mist. Shortly after the lawyers
have started there will be a high, opaque cloud of
doubt screening the Allies’ line from the foe, and
it will rapidly become an impenetrable bank of
vapor stretching upward to the blue vault of Heaven.
The Allies ’planes, stationed on the foe’s side of
the screen, will prevent the enemy’s aircraft from
penetrating the curtain, while the Allied generals
make their dispositions. Meanwhile the lawyers will
continue to obscure the facts and cloud the issue 'in
the most gallant manner. A special V.C. might be
struck, on which, in place of the familiar “For
Valor,” would appear the words “For Pettifogging.”
If Kitchener will take up the idea, many lawyers
in the near future will thrill with pride when they
hear themselves described as heroes who saved the
Empire.
“Hang the Kaiser” : The bloke who offers
his service's and is told to go away and grow
teeth or get younger or buy a chest is feeling
sorry that he doesn’t get a paper stating that
he honestly tried to rush into danger. It
couldn’t hurt the authorities to give one,
and it would save some fellows a lot of most
undeserved unpleasantness.
Under-strappers who wait for the shoes
of Parliamentary Clerks have the most
heart-breaking job a-going. Just-resigned
Harry Otterson was 44 years clerk in Maori-
land House of Reps.; Bernays held the
same post in Bananaland Assembly over 50
years; and Calvert was somewhere about 60
summers in the N.S.W. Council. Which
suggests that the fumes of a law-factory are
not so unhealthy as politicians try to make
out.
For the purpose of discovering, among
other things, what (if anything) was behind
the alleged agreement made between one
Nick Mutton, of Coolamon (N.S.W.), and
W. H. Drew, a Sydney solicitor, with respect
to the payment of £lOOO for certain unspeci-
fied services in connection with the passage
of the N.S.W. Wheat Bill, Justice Ferguson
has formally called the various parties up
and informed them that he will be ready to
take evidence on Monday. Generally speak-
ing, the inquiry is into the question whether
anyone connected with the passage of the Bill
was “prevailed unon” or approached to do
anything, and (incidentally) as to what Mr.
Drew was going to do or did do or didn’t
dream of doing to earn the fees of Mr.
Nicholas Mutton, of Coolamon.
“The boot” has added another to its long
list of victims in Australia. On October
24 last, Constable Glen Robert Lilley, while
rescuing a civilian from a crowd of toughs,
spielers and criminals at Clifton Hill. Mel-
bourne, was set upon by about 60, and
hacked about the head with “the boot” until
apparently he was dead. Then the scum
scattered. Dilley, however, recovered, and
in due course returned to duty. But the
former smart officer sank into malaise and
melancholy, and last week he ended his life
by poison. Medical evidence at the inquest
proved that there was a perforation of the
skull, due, as the general evidence showed,
to injuries received from the favorite weapon
of the “push.” Incidentally, the only two
of Lillby’s assailants who were arrested
after the assault were fined £2O each by a
suburban Bench. The fines were paid, and
Justice (Suburban Bench brand) was satis-
fied..
“Dotty” : It isn’t so long since an amiable
gentleman was discovered up a tree in com-
pany with a lighted candle. When an ex-
planation was requested, he said, very simply
and quietly, that he was searching for
scenery. Instead of being rewarded for his
originality, he was led away and immured
somewhere. Last week another scientific
investigator climbed up a chimney-stack to
get a closer look at the moon. In the midst
of his investigations he suddenly came to the
conclusion that the lamp of night was falling
on him ; so, without a moment’s hesitation,
he. took a header to earth and broke his
thigh. He was hopelessly wrong; but, at
the same time, one can’t help admiring him
for his honest, attempt to look intelligently
upward and his courageous resolve to leap
down. In this world there are altogether
too many people muckraking for odd shill-
ings and minding the step.


HI BEGAN
TO FALL OUT
Awful Pain and Itchy Feeling. Head
Mass of Irritation. Kept Awake
at Night. Awful Burning. Cuti-
cura Soap and Ointment Healed,
Box 4 G. P. 0., Brisbane, Queensland
“About two years ago I began to get an
awful pain and itchy feeling in my head and
my hair began to fall out. My head be-
came one mass of irritation and I was kept
awake at night with the terrible pain. I
had that many sleepless nights that I was
just on the eve of a breakdown when the
wonderful Cuticura Soap and Cuticura
Ointment came to the rescue. I was fright-
ened to comb or brush my hair it was falling
out that fast. During that awful time I
could only see my nearest friends because
I had to keep on scratching my head so
much.
“I tried many different remedies but
all had the same result —no good. I was
beginning to lose heart, but one day I de-
cided to give Cuticura a trial and wrote
for Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment
which gave me instant relief from that
awful, itching, burning feeling about the
head and after a week’s treatment I was
cured. lam proud of my hair it is that soft
and glossy. I also find that the Cuticura
Soap not only makes the hair grow but
makes the skin beautifully soft, also free
from blemish.” (Signed) Mrs. M. Kelly,
May 1, 1914.

A SENSE of satisfaction is experienced
every time one wears a pair of
Bostock boots, and from this con-
sciousness of their fine quality springs a
natural and legitimate pride. One feels
that they will contribute to ease and
elegance on the most exacting occasions,
and one knows that their high quality
will be recognised every time they are
handled. This sense of satisfaction is
the inevitable effect of the choice leather
and beautiful work so conspicuous in
every pair of Bostocks. They are the
cream of imported shoes.

The Agricultural Editors of the “Arntralasian” and.the “^£ucernist

to inspect and report on the quality of the land.
HERE ARE THE REPORTS: •
Millbank, Bacchus Marsh, 30th October, 1914.
Messrs. Isles, Love & Co., COOCHIN ES TATE.
Dear Sirs —Referring to my having been selected by the “ Australasian,
. h » i> Robertson Esq M.L.A. to inspect the Coochin-Coochin property
in may s o ay that there is splendid land on the flats-in most places
a« deep and really superior in quality to anything to be *°und on Bacchus Marsh,
as deep, ana the S oil which varies from brown to black in colour, it is
of good texture and easy to cultivate under any climatic conditions, wet or dry.
The bodv of th£ soil, which is from 10 to 25 feet deep, rests upon a bed of
water-worn drift, an ideal factor for drainage and the best indication of permanent
The enormous supply of water, and the ease with which the flats
can be irrigated ™rtant engaged mostly in
lucerne and other cultivation, and I conscienciously state that I was astounded at
the mlgnmcent quality and extent of the Coochin land, which I can only describe
W which I have ever walked over.” If the Coochin Flats were shifted to
Bacchus Marsh, my friends there would rush them at £lOO per acre and upwards.

the above Estate for the cultivation of lucerne, I have pleasure, after
completing % lucerne growing on the Hunter

Coochin-Coochin Flats are in every way equal to the very best quality land in my
Hicsfript' for the cultivation of this valuable fodder plant. .
An immense depth of rich alluvial soil —little or no clearing necessary
nhnml ant water for stock or irrigation, splendid railway service—a pros-
perous Town with Schools, Churches, Sawmills and Hospital Poetically adjoin-

The simple faith of the mug with money is
not more amazing than the fact that so many
mugs have money to lose. In December a
man was induced to part with £325 in Mel- .
bourne to two men —practically strangers to
him—on a vague proposition about building
a picture show in Patagonia, or somewhere.
Leaving the money in the Savings Bank in
the names of the strangers, he went away
a-sailing the sea and rejoicing over a profit-
able investment. On his return he thought
he would like to collect a dividend, but could
find neither the strangers nor the coin. The
strangers have since been found, but the
money remains gone, and it looks as if the
trustful one will have to settle down to hard
work and collect a brand new £325.
W. S. Campbell, formerly Under Sec. for
Agriculture in N. S. Wales, recently lectured
before the Australian Historical Society on
“The Oldest Australian Industry.” Before-
hand there was a sort of guessing competition.
One ventured that Australia’s most vener-
able industry was brickmaking; another
thought hut-building. Campbell plumped for
beche-de-mer fishing. He showed that long
before Phillip invaded Port Jackson, Timor
boatmen had established a fishery at Port
Darwin, and alleged that the ruins of some
of the old cooking “pots” are still knocking
about.

“J.G.”: The three Yankee motor-trains
imported by the Murray-Watt Government, in
defiance, it is said, of the opinion of the
Railway Commissioners, were going to “re-
volutionise railway travelling” in Victoria.
They have. A passenger when he took a
seat in one of these trains never knew when
he would have to get out and push. Some-
times the cars would suddenly go on strike
in the middle of a good section of line. Then
the disgusted passengers would be bundled
out, and forced to tramp to an ordinary coal-
driven train, or wait until a locally-made
Newport loco, came along. For the first
few. weeks the antics of these imported
machines were looked upon as jokes; but.
now the unfortunate people who use them,
decline to see the jocularity. It is sug-
gested that if the things are as good as the
Government says they are, they should be
withdrawn from the regular lines and used
as specials for Murray and the rest of the
Ministry. Then the parlor cars, which are
now merely used to pull officials about the
country, could be released for ordinary pas-
sengers.

The Law reaped a fine harvest one sultry
February morning, when shipmasters paid

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Upon a far selection
He came, near close of day,
With heavy-laden pack-horse,
And asked, the bushman’s way,
For grass, and flour, and shelter
And leave that night to stay.
lie led his horse to water
Beside the black duck lake, v
Then made a fire for supper
To cook his johnny-cake ;
While shy bush children clustered
Bound trees to watch the sheik.
lie bowed him to the sunset
With movement of despair,
When, through the glowing forest,
He heard the warning blare,
The magpies’ clear muezzin
That called the hour for prayer.
“My mosque is but the forest,
And much the Faithful frets,
With dome, a sky of azure
That Allah round me sets,
And strange tall trees aspiring
Like holy minarets.
“The reiver of the Border
Across the Khyber spins;
The merchant in Bokhara
Is spreading silks and skins;
But here I wander lonely
Weighed down by many sins.
“And I would cross the passes
And swoop on Kandahar
To loot the lazy merchants
A-down the bright bazaar;
But, oh ! my heart is heavy,
For I have travelled far.
“There is no God but Allah,
The Glorious, the Great!
There is no might, no majesty
To break the bonds of Fate,
Save Allah, the Compassioning —
Allah, compassionate!’’
And then beside the camp-fire,
Beneath an alien moon,
He rolled him in his blanket;
The children heard him croon
Wild chants of raid and rapine,
Nor understood the rune.
And when at dawn they mustered
The milkers all in force,
Gravely their guest, the Afghan,
Paid tribute for his horse,
The custom of the country,
Salaamed, and went his .course.

A Courting Catastrophe.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CONYERS was thirsting fot revenge.
Gregory Cramp, the fat little draper
at Klihker’s Emporium, had held him
Up to public ridicule by basely intervening at
the iast moineht and preventing him marry-
ing his daughter, the fair Rubina. In his
bitter humiliation and disappointment lie
had sought the seclusion of Lankey’s Hut,
an empty habitation, two miles above Sleepy
Hollow, that was seldom Occupied except by
travellers. There he simmered and plotted,
and muttered fearful threats against the in-
sufferable person who refused to be his
father-in-law 1 .
He had the company of Murty Brown,
since the little paddock in which the hut
stood was a good spelling place for horses.
Mhrty went into town every day, and thus
kept Conyers posted as to the doings of
Gregory and other people lie was interested
iii. if Murty mentioned that he had a yarn
with a mutual acquaintance, Conyers Would
Immediately ask : “Did he say anything about
me?’’ He had a suspicion that a lot of people
Were talking about him, instead of minding
their own business.
lii this way Conyers came to know that
Gregory Cramp and George Kata, the barber,
had suddenly developed the warmest regard
for each other. Mr. Katz had recently been
elevated to the dignity of an alderman; and
a flourishing business, together With other
activities of his in Sleepy Hollow, placed him
on the proud pinnacle of a leading citizen.
He was squat of figure, his face broad, and
ornamented with a thick moustache that
always looked as if it was gummed on.
“If you don't look alive, Mat, lie’ll be
cuttin’ you out,” Murty remarked by way of
encouragement. ‘‘They say Gregory’s domes-
tic establishment has such a powerful attrac-
tion for him that he sometimes runs across
to see it in the middle of shaving a cus-
tomer.” ,
“Cramp would crawl after anybody who
was in a little bit of a position. He’s that
sort,” growled Conyers, “But lie’s got no
hope of persuadin’ Ruby to take up with his
latherin’ alderman. Ruby wouldn’t be found
dead with him.” .
“Don’t make too sure,” Murty cautioned.
“Girls are mercenary creatures; an’ I don’t
suppose Miss Cramp is very extraordin’ly
different from the average.” .
“She’s engaged to me,” Conyers reminded
him.
“Consequently she knows you ve got two
horses, an’ a couple of saddles, an’ a cattle-
dog,” Murty rejoined. “But a girl expects
the man she marries to have something more
than that. She expects him to have a home
to set her up in.”
“She was going to marry me, wasn’t she l
Conyers demanded nastily. “I’m no worse
off now than I was then, am IV”
“Perhaps you told her you had a squat-
tage outback,” Murty retorted. “I know that
imagination of yours runs away with you
sometimes, ’specially when under the influ-
ence o’ girl. Anyhow, she can’t help niakin
comparisons when Mr. Katz is usin’ his
blandishments on her. He’s got a snug little
place of his own, with a pretty flower garden
in front; an’ lie’s got a business that will
provide fine dresses an’ jewellery. Besides,
bein’ a person of some tonnage in the munici-
pality, his wife would be right in it at the
mayoral ball an’ other social functions. If
Rubina doesn’t succumb I’ll be much sur-
prised.”
“You’ll be more surprised if you hear she s
eloped with me, won’t you?”
“I will!”
Murty’s candor had an irritating effect on
Conyers. He walked out of the hut in a
sulky temper, and glaring at the inoffensive
township, he threatened to stagger its com-
mercial props by never spending another
copper in Katz’s dirty shop, or in Ivlinker’s
rotten emporium.
At that moment a buggy came rattling
along the road. He watched it listlessly
until it drew opposite. Then he gave a start
as if something had prodded him in. the
back; his eyes opened wide, with an expres-
sion in them like an angry snake’s, and his
face assumed a ghastly hue.
The driver of the vehicle was Alderman
George Katz, and at his side, apparently in
the happiest of spirits, sat Rubina Cramp.
Her musical voice, as she chatted past, made
his heart ache, and her merry laugh sounded
like mockery in his ears.
Murty came out and added fuel to the
raging flames.
“Hulloa!” he said. “Blest if George ain’t
fair on the job already! Now, that’s the
way I like to see a young man go about
courtin’. Dash right in an’ carry the little
peach off her feet, instead o’ leanin’ against
the doorpost for a month, talkin’ about the
weather. Twig the ardorous attitude of
him! Ken scarce see where the horse is
goin’ for admiration.” His gaze shifted
from the receding vehicle to Conyers’ scowl-
ing face. “Who’s goin’ to be Mr. Cramp’s
son-in-law now?”
“Not that swine !” snapped Conyers. ‘lll
give Cramp enough o’ Katz before I’m done
with him. You’ll see !”
He rushed inside again, tore round the
boundaries of the interior, swinging his arms
recklessly, and finally sat down in the fire-
place and nursed the germ of a crude, com-
monplace idea that had come to him from a
frequent repetition of the barber’s detested
name.
That evening he went down to the Boom-
erang Hotel. In the parlor he obtained pen

SYMPTOMS * KIDNEY TROUBLE
such as Lumbago, Rheumatism, Dropsy,
Backache, Gravel, Stone, Sciatica
and Bladder Disorders
ARE SERIOUS.
J ou never know what complications kidney trouble may lead to.
Healthy kidneys purify the blood and enable it to vitalise the system,
but when the kidneys are weakened or diseased this all-important process is
reversed. Poisons and waste matter remain in the blood, to spread disease
throughout the body.
Uric acid is your worst enemy in this respect, for its jagged crystals
settle in the muscles, nerves and joints, and agonise each movement of your
limbs.
That sharp, shooting pain in the back is Lumbago—-the pain that darts
through the thigh or leg is Sciatica —the sickening ache and constant pain
across the shoulders and in the hands, knees and joints is Rheumatism.
Only most careful treatment and a special kidney medicine can revive
the failing kidneys, and Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are for the kidneys
and bladder only—they gently regulate, heal and strengthen them, and
enable the kidneys to drain the uric acid and collected water from the body,
to cleanse and purify the blood and to flush and soothe the urinary sj^stem.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills do not act on the bowels.

A SYDNEY MAN
A SYDNEY WOMAN.
Mr. F. J. Stark, Grocer, Wine and
Provision Merchant, Regent Street,
Ivogarah. Sydney, says" Some years
ago a sudden, knife-like pain struck me
across the back and side, which got so
bad that I had to call in a doctor. He
did not cure me, and I went on suffering
until I heard about Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills. As soon as I commenced
to use these Pills I felt easier, and it
only took three bottles to cure me. lam
glad to be free of the terrible pain, and
can thank Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
aloue for my cure.”
Six years later, Mr. Stark says:—
"Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills perman-
ently cured me—for I have had no return
of backache for .the past six years. There
is no doubt about it, Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills are thoroughly good, and I
can strongly recommend them to other
sufferers.”
Mrs. E. Weir, 168 Botany Road,
Alexandria, Sydney, says:—“ln com-
mon with many others I ,can give
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills a first-
class recommendation as a cure for
backache and kidney disorder, these
Pills having cured me of a bad attack
some few months ago. Before I took
this remedy I suffered terribly, my back
being so stiff and painful that l could
hardly get about. In fact, I have been
so bad that I have had to lay up, being
almost crippled with the awful pain. My
ankles and leg swelled considerably, and
were sore to the touch, and I was also
subject to dizzy attacks. I could not
get proper rest at night, and, in conse-
quence, always felt dull and tired, and
had no energy. However, a course of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills soon put
an end to my health troubles, and I have
been grand ever since.”

PIUS
ECZEMA
A Lasting Cure by
DOAN’S OINTMENT.
Mr. H. Matson, senr., 210 Denison Street, Camperdown. Sydnev, says“A
couple of years ago I had Eczema break out very badly on my chest. It was shortly
after I had returned from a trip to India, where I had gone with horses. I had fever
badly in India, and the Eczema seemed to be the result of this sickness. It was very
severe, and spread rapidly, until I was in such a state that the pain and irritation
nearly drove me mad. \V hen I went to bed at night my sufferings were worst, and it
was nearly morning before I could get to sleep. A man I know advised me to get
Doan’s Ointment, saying that he had heard of excellent results from the use of this
preparation. I thought it a good idea, and obtained a pot. The first application
was cooling, and the second soothed the itch, and after that I got along splendidly.
Every time I applied the Ointment there was a marked improvement, until I was
quite cured. Within a month from the first time I used the Ointment not one trace
of the ailment remained. Doan’s Ointment is a splendid preparation for Eczema,
skin irritation, to take inflammation from the skin, and to heal.”
Ten years later, Mr. Watson confirms the above :—“lt is now ten years since
Doan’s Ointment cured me of Eczema, and I am pleased to say that the cure has
stood the test of time. lam still quite free of this dreadful complaint.”
Doan’s Ointment is sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers at 2/9 per pot,
or post free by Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.
and ink and a square sheet of paper, with
which materials he busied himself for some
minutes. Then, with the paper held behind
him, he went to the door and glanced fur-
tively up and down the street. It was the
hour when properly-regulated citizens usually
sat down to tea. Seeing nobody about, Con-
yers stepped forth, and in a minute the
document was surreptitiously pasted up on
the notice-board at the corner of the hotel.
Half an hour afterwards Abner Boker
sauntered along, looking for somebody who
would be generous enough to ask him to have
a drink. The notice attracted his roving
eye, and, putting on his spectacles, he thrust
his nose at it and read :
WANTED.
Half a dozen cats. Good price paid for first-class
mousers. Apply at Boolahna, Myrtle Street.
“Boolahna? That’s Gregory Cramp’s
place.” Abner mused, scratching his chin
thoughtfully. He read -it again, tracing the
line with his linger: “Good price paid for
first-class mousers.”
“Well,” he cogitated, moving slowly off
towards home, “there’s not a better mouser
in town than our old Sandy. I’ll go bail on
that.”
The more he thought of Sandy’s excellence
the more his mouth watered and the quicker
his legs moved. Sandy was a pet of Mrs.
Boker’s, but it occurred to Abner that that
sort of pet wasn’t healthy, and ought to be.
got rid of. Its breath was poisonous, and
it harbored fleas.
He crept round to the back like a burglar,
calling “Puss, Puss,” very softly. Presently
a welcome purr was heard, and a tail
brushed against his legs. Abner tucked the
beast under his arm, drawing his coat over
it to keep it warm, and departed with a
smartness that few people would have
credited him with.
On the way to Boolahna he nearly ran
into Josh Taylor. The latter was sprinting
down a back lane, his terrier in front of
him, and a frantic cat a few yards in front
of the terrier, making desperate efforts to
reach cover. Abner hurried on.
Round the next corner he surprised Bill
Waggles squatting at a gap in a paling fence.
There was a big black Tom inside, and Bill
was good-naturedly offering it a piece of fresh
meat. Abner hastened breathlessly.
Near Boolahna something scurried wildly
across his path. A lumbering dog that had
been following collided with him. and in tin'
resultant fall he lost Sandy. He had no
time to ascertain who owned the dog, for
Sandy seemed to have developed suspicions,
and a quarter of an hour elapsed before
Abner got hold of him again.
When he reached the house there were
already two sellers at the door. One was a
barelegged boy, holding an animated bag by
the mouth, and the other was an indignant
old lady with a basket, who wanted to know
what Mr. Cramp meant by fooling people.
Mr. Cramp, who was very red in the face,
and equally indignant, was saying that it
must be a hoax played on them by an out-
size in idiots, for he knew nothing about the
matter.
Abner, thinking they were wrangling over
the quality of the goods, pushed to the front.
“Here,” he said, shovirs: the clawing ani-
mal against Gregory’s white shirt. “If it’s
a good mouser you want, there ain’t a better-
in town than that old Sandy.”
Gregory heaved Sandy from him with
vituperation, and Sandy, escaping from his
master’s clutches, took to his heels, with
Cramp’s dog in hot and noisy pursuit.
“What do you mean by it?” Mr. Cramp
vociferated.
“Wlrat do you mean?” Abner countered,
thrusting his face forward. “You want cats,
don’t you?”
“No, I don’t!” Cramp roared at him. “I’ve
got all I want.”
“Why couldn't you say so civilly then,
instead of insultin’ a man?” Abner de-
manded. turning wratlifully away.
Bill Waggles bustled up before he had got
off the verandah. Bill had four cats, which,
after a heated encounter with Mr. Cramp,
he unloaded on the premises. Bill was short-
tempered, and called Cramp vile names. He
also threw his hat down, and his coat after
it, and invited him to come outside and, get
stiffened.
The other disappointeds were trying to
calm him, when Josh Taylor stepped briskly
up to the door and butted the furious draper
with two scared creatures that clawed and
spat at him.
Mr. Cramp retreated hastily and slammed
the door. For a few seconds Tosh Taylor
stood on the mat, staring blankly at wood.
Abner called out to him that Cramp had got
all he required.
“Oh, is that it?” said Taylor, sourly.
“Dashed polite way of lettin’ a man know it,
anyway.”
He looked about him with an ugly droop
at the corner of his mouth and fire in his
eye. The fanlight over the door was open.
Grasping his cats, he hurled them one by
one into the room, and decamped with a
leisurely, defiant stride. Muffled shrieks
and thuds issued from inside as the others
followed him away.
A couple of the castaways, being hustled
by Cramp’s dog, took refuge on the roof. At
a late hour, when the perturbed household
had retired to rest, the family grimalkin
climbed up to investigate. Discovering the
strangers in his domain, he hurled loud and
abusive challenges across the roof, and the
strangers from their side yowled defiance and
made ugly faces at him. For two hours they
caterwauled in nerve-wracking cadences from
opposite sides; then they clashed with tre-
mendous applause, and proceeded to settle
the argument in the centre of the skillion
roof, tumbling all over the resounding iron,
and hitting it with terrific thumps, inter-
mingled with savage grunts and fortissimo
yowls.
Mr. Cramp got up, seized his revolver, and
rushed out with murderous intentions. He
fired wildly at the noise. The first shot
smashed the kitchen chimney-pot, and the
second left a gaping wound in the iron,
which subsequently needed the attentions of'
a plumber. By that time the midnight
rioters had dispersed.
In the morning Cramp found three dead
cats in his yard, but they were hanging by
the tails to the clothes line. The sight so
affected him that he couldn’t eat any break-
fast.
More of the feline species arrived during
the day. The news had spread that Cramp
wanted cats, and everybody who had a
surplus in that line, or could catch the
nuisance next door, brought it along to his
residence. The draper had gone to business.
Mrs. Cramp answered the first couple of
callers, dismissed them summarily, and
thereafter quiet, watching through the
window, till the cat-liawkers got tired of
waiting and left the place. They also left
the cats. One of them was so mad that he
broke the window with his cat.
A wild humorist presented some felines
to Rubina, saying that as she was going to
marry Katz she was doubtless fond of
them. At this point she wept bitterly.
“The whole town is making fun of us!”
she wailed to her mother. “Everybody’s
laughing at us !”
That evening the barber called, bearing a
floral offering for his friend’s pretty
daughter. The friend and his wife talked
cats with him for half an hour, and then
Mrs. Cramp went in search of Rubina. She
found her lying on the bed, dabbing her nose
with a tiny handkerchief.
“Ruby, what’s the matter with you?” the
old lady remonstrated. “Mr. ' Katz is
here”
“Katz!” Ruby shrieked. “For Heaven’s
sake, haven't we had enough of cats?”
“Don’t be silly!” said her mother
impatiently. “He has something for you.
Come on out.”
But Ruby was obdurate.
“I won’t!” she said, turning her face to
the wall. “Send him away ! Don’t mention
him to me. I hate him!”
Her mother returned to (he sitting-room,
and apologetically informed the visitor that
Miss ('ramp had gone to bed with a bad
headache.
When the amorous barber called again
Miss Cramp had retired with the toothache;
a lid on the third occasion that he presented
himself she was laid up with the earache.
Mr. Katz expressed a hope that the young
lady would never suffer with the heartache,
and left early. He did not call any more,
and within a week from the posting of tin 1
fatal notice he and Mr. Cramp had left off
speaking to each other.
Conyers was jubilant.
“What about your dashing alderman now?”
lie twitted Murty, digging him playfully in
the ribs.
“What about Rubina?” Murty parried.
“You wait a while” —confidently. ‘ If I
get half an hour’s talk with her, you’ll hear
of an elopement in this district very soon
afterwards.”
“Better be slippery,” Murty advised. “I
saw Constable Murphy talkin’ to her the
other day. ’Twas the mornin’ (’ramp found
his clothes-line decorated with dead animals.”
Conyers laughed. “So Gregory got the
law to work, did he? I didn’t know that.”
“Murphy’s been lookin’ for clues about
Boolahna ever since,” Murty went on.
“Better look out for him.”
“Oh, he w r on’t catch me,” said Conyers,
boastfully.
“I don’t say he’ll catch you,” said Murty.
“But seems to me that cat-plague was the
means of a pleasant introduction.”
The happy look vanished suddenly from
Conyer’s face. He eyed his comforting mate
with the aspect of a sheep.
“Ruby is a pretty girl,” Murty explained,
“an’ Constable Murphy is a lot better lookin’
than you, Conyers, if you don’t mind me
tellin’ you so.”
“Fat lot you know about looks,” Conyers
snarled. “If I had a face like yours I’d
swop it for a baboon’s.”
“He’s got a steady job, too, which you
haven’t,” Murty added, unabashed.
“I haven’t got your narrow mind an’ dis-
gruntled views either,” Conyers retorted.
He lit a cigarette, and then continued, as if
speaking to himself: “Old scallywags, who’ve
been jilted in their youth, think every girl’s
a heartless flirt.”
“I was never jilted,” Murty informed him.
“”N’ if I’ve insinuated that girls were
flirts, because a lot of ’em dropped you when
they got to know you better. I apologise.”
Conyers dabbed his hat on and went down
the paddock to look at his horses. He sat
on a log and looked at them till sundown.
In the dusk he steered for Boolahna, and
after viewing the place from every possible
point, he glued himself to the back fence and
waited. For three hours he kept a vigilant
eye on the back door, in the expectation
that Miss Cramp would come out to empty
the scraps, or to get a dipper of water, or
some kindling wood for the morning. The
notes of a dreamy waltz floated out to him.
making him feel desperately love-sick; and
he wondered if he would ever be able to buy
her a piano. Hope died when the lights were
extinguished, and he trudged miserably back
to Lankey’s Hut.
He returned the next night, and for
several following nights lie crouched against
the same fence, only detaching himself and
taking brisk exercise when a pedestrian
happened to pass along that way.
On the sixth night his patience was
rewarded. Some clothes hung on the line
near the back gate, and the girl came
tripping down the path to take them in.
Conyers hastened to the gate, which he
opened with the care of a man handling an
infernal machine, and crept noiselessly into
the yard.
Just then a heavy hand fell on his
shoulder, and he was jerked violently back-
wards. The next instant his eyes lit on the
burly figure of Constable Murphy.
“Caught you in the act, my man,” said
that officer, clapping the handcuffs on the
protesting Conyers. “I thought I would.
I’ve been keeping an eye on Boolahna and
its precincts for some time, having been
informed on good authority that a black-
guard was prowlin’ about it with suspicious
frequency.”
“I was only waitin’ to see the girl.”
Conyers wailed in his ear.
The constable chuckled. “ ’Twill be a
month at least before you’ll see another
girl.” he said cheerfully. “Come along,
Conyers!”
He was a true prophet. Conyers got a
month without the option for being illegally
on Mr. Cramp’s, premises, for trying to steal
clothes off the line, and on general suspicion
ot theft of cats.
Two days before he came out Miss Cramp
was married to Constable Murphy.

What an Excursionist
Says:
“For an enjoyable outing or a holiday
arms and ammunition
make the equipment complete. I al-
ways take a fienilngtQri-UMC shotgun or
rifle along on such trips. Maybe a little hunt-
ing; a little target shooting; maybe a little of
both—and I haven’t yet found the sport that
yields so much pleasure and profit. I know
when I am getting real recreation and I can
_ take my rifle or gun in my suit-case anywhere,
and don’t have to carry any tools. My 22
calibre rifle is my favorite for these excursions.’*
