THE beautiful Cotswold village
of Minster Lovell, situated in
the valley on the River Windfush
three miles from Chipping Norton,
possesses the ruins of a 15th century
manor house, where, says tradition,
the tragedy of the Mistletoe Bough
took place.
Minster Lovell Hall, pictured
here, was built by Lord Lovell,
Chamberlain to Richard 111. The
King owned the fishing rights on
the Windrush from Mousham Mill
to Minster Weir, and was a frequent
visitor to this district. The Lovell
family, who gave their name to the
village, also owned the 12th century
Priory which was dissolved in 1430.
.Although the ruins as they are seen
today give only a vague impression
of its former greatness, they yet show
with what cafe and skill the masons
of those days worked, turning the
honey-coloured Cotswold stone into
delicate arch and tracery.
The Lovells were not always loyal
to the crown. A disastrous attempt
to assist the Pretender, Lambert
Simnel, to the throne, found Francis,
the last of the Lovells, in flight after
the Battle of Stoke Field in 1487,
when Henry VII defeated and cap-
tured the Pretender. Lord Lovell
sought refuge in the only sanctuary
he knew —a secret vault in the Manor
of Minster Lovell, where he died
of starvation owing to the death of
a servant who alone knew the secret
of his hiding-place. The secret was
revealed 200 years later, in 1708,
when a new chimney was being
built, the secret vault was revealed in
which a skeleton, identified as Lord
Lovell by the cap and clothes, was
found in a chair and upon the table
was an open Bible.

LIFE OF A VOLCANO .
Stefan Zweig died with his Balzac
(Cassell; Angus and Robertson) un-
finished. It has been edited for publica-
tion by Richard Friedenthal and trans-
lated by William and Dorothy Rose.
That Zweig should have been unable,
or perhaps reluctant, to complete it is
understandable. When he left Europe for
England and then Brazil he had to leave
behind his notes and the enormous mass
of material he had collected; but even if
Hitler had not cut across the path of
literature, one suspects that, for the simple
reason thht he found Balzac inexhaustibly
fascinating, Zweig would have lingered
long over his task. “Something of
Balzac’s own restlessness seemed to have
infected his biographer,” writes Frieden-
thal: —
Balzac played havoc with Stefan Zweig’s
self-imposed discipline. He kept adding to
the files of material he had already accumu-
lated. New vistas were constantly opening
up, and what he had already written was
subject to constant revision. His magnificent
collection of authors’ manuscripts included
one of the most precious of the volumes in
which Balzac had bound up his manuscript
with the successive series of proofs, and
these entangled, unending proof corrections
seemed to exert a mysterious, hypnotic effect
on Zweig. The small study of his house in
Bath, into which he had moved shortly
before the outbreak of war, became a Balzac
museum, a depository of Balzac archives,
a centre of information about Balzac.
How could a biographer be expected
to complete the life of a volcano? This
was a man who, so he declared, had led
“the most dreadful childhood that has
ever fallen to the lot of any man” ; who
at the age of 22 ha(l written, sometimes
alone and sometimes in collaboration
with the potboiler le Poitevin, some 20
volumes of sfentimental and adventurous
romance; who was to produce in that
year another three novels of four volumes
each; and who was confident that he
could turn out at least five and perhaps
10 such novels a year.
Balzac himself would have extracted —
in fact, thinly disguised in novel form,
did extract —half a dozen volumes out of
his robust father and his narrow, com- ,
plaining mother, who, he said, “hated me
before I was born” ; out of the extra-
ordinary infancy in which he was handed
over to the care of strangers, taken to
visit his parents only once a week on
Sundays; out of the school of the Ora-
torian Brothers, where he froze, half-
starved and was whipped, and from which
he came home at 14 “haggard, like a
sleepwalker groping his way along with
a vacant gaze” ; and out of those first
years in Paris /When he decided that he
must be not a notary but a great writer
and, having persuaded his family to let
him try out his genius for a year—“a
stout, thickset figure, untidy black hair,
bony features, a large mouth and de-
fective teeth, particularly and strikingly
ugly in spite of the intelligence which
sparkled in his small eyes”—shut himself
up in his garret, sometimes for three or
four days without a break, writing day
and night at a tragedy in verse which
turned out a complete failure.
A volume—a series of volumes —might
have been written about the years of
drudgery which followed: the “dark
time,” in Zweig’s rather exaggerated
phrase, of hack-work, piracy, plagiarism,
exuberant potboiling and fantastic in-
dustry from Balzac’s 22nd to his 30th
year, when, besides his dozens of cheap
popular romances, he wrote
books and brochures ad lib. for suspect
politicians, obscure publishers and slick
agents, cheap ranges of goods in all styles
and at all prices He patched other men’s
novels with scraps of his own and bare-
facedly stole other writers’ plots and situa-
tions. He was the greatest storyteller of
his age, yet he was nothing but the hireling
of the scabbiest hole-and-corner publishers
and wholesale book-hawkers of Paris.
But Balzac, at 30, with scores of books
published to which he was ashamed to
put his name, is only at the beginning of
that unremitting volcanic eruption in
which, to the despair of biographers, he
lived and worked.
There are his amazing and invariably
disastrous business ventures to be dealt
with: how he decided that to be a pub-
lisher was the only way in which an
author could really hope to make money ;
how, when the publishing venture ran
him into debt, he decided that he must
be printer as well as publisher and how
his attempt to recoup himself left him,
at the age of .29, “triply bankrupt, as a
publisher, as a printer and as the owner
of a type-foundry” and 100,000 francs
in debt to his parents and his middle-
aged mistress, Madame de Bemy; how
he bought the newspaper “Ghronique de
Paris” —with, of course, other people’s
money—and, when the paper collapsed,
had added another 40,000 francs to his
burden of debt; how, chiefly to econo-
mise, he bought—with an advance on an
unwritten novel: his normal method of
finance —a “humble cottage” in the coun-
try, and, then, because he had heard a
railway was to be constructed in the
neighborhood, bought up land for miles
around at any price the peasants cared
to ask, employed an army of workmen to
turn his “humble” estate into a magnifi-
cent park with orchard and vineyards
around it, built a beautiful wall round
the place which repeatedly and expen-
sively fell down, and how he finally
escaped from that venture into economy
with another 100,000 francs of debts;
how his grand scheme for exploiting the
Sardinian silver-mines abandoned by the
Romans loaded him with still more
debts; how, as a result of these ventures,
of his extravagance, and of his practice
of living always on advances for un-
written works, he had to live in hiding
even in his years of fame, with his credi-
tors hunting him in the streets and the
bailiffs waiting on his doorstep ; and how,
when he did at long last make a fortune,
by marrying Madame de Hanska, it killed
him: for though the cause of his death
at 51 may simply have been the combina-
tion of overwork and black coffee (some-
body estimated that he drank, in his life-
time, 50,000 cups of it) it seems equally
likely that his adventurous spirit felt that,
with no more debts to pay off, life was
not worth living.
Along with his financial struggles,
curiously and often amusingly involved
with them, for he always dreamed of
marrying money, goes the story of
Balzac’s love affairs; and here, too, the
biographer has to cope with something
extravagant, complicated, and—as far as
les filles were concerned —innumerable.
Once again, Balzac’s life can be com-
pared only to a novel by Balzac: to a
series of novels. He was a man who
would travel all the way to Switzerland
for a kiss from a woman he had never
seen; and he was a man who could have
drawn from his own life the material for
the most earthy as well as the most in-
credible scenes of the Contes Drolatiques.
There was the estimable Madame de
Berny, chivalrously portrayed by Zweig
as the reluctant party in the affair,
who, being 45 when he 'was 23,
became his mistress at a time when his
anxious parents thought he was paying
court to her daughter. There was the
Duchess d’Abrantes, who extended to the
writer in his thirtieth years favors which
had previously been bestowed on Murat
and Prince Metternich —illustrious pre-
decessors for a young man who wor-
shipped a title. There was Zulma Car-
raud, the wife of an artillery captain in
Angouleme, who gave Balzac “the best,
the noblest, the purest, the most valuable
and the most lasting of his friendships”
and who was an acute critic of his works:
She admired Louis Lambert, Le Colonel
Chabert, Cesar Birotteau and Eugenie
Grandet, while having a lively distaste for
the overscented salon stories such as La
Femme de Trente Ans, quite justly calling
Le Medecin de Campagne “too viscous and
overburdened with ideas” and being re-
pelled by the exaggerated pseudo-mysticism
of Seraphita. With astonishing lucidity she
perceived every danger that threatened his
prospects of permanent success. When he
tried to enter politics she anxiously warned
him: “The Contes Drolatiques are more
important than a Minister’s portfolio.”
There were more titles, with elegant
ladies attached to them, like a kind of
happy afterthought: the Marquise de
Castries, of .whom Balzac wrote to Zulma
Carraud, “I must now go to Aix and
climb up to Savoy, running after some-
one who is perhaps making fun of me” ;
the Contessa Guidoboni-Visconti, “the
offspring of an eccentric English family
in which suicides and explosive outbursts
of passion were of epidemic occurrence” ;
and, finally and fatally, of course,
Madame de Hanska.
This affair, once again, would in itself
make a novel or a plump volume of
biography. Stefan Zweig suggests, in
fact, that in his relations with Madame
de Hanska Balzac was trying to turn his
life into a kind of fiction. And a wholly
Balzacian novel he made of it. It was
aristocratic —the lady was the wife of
the Baron Wenceslav de Hanski, the
owner of enormous estates in the Ukraine,
the ruler of hordes of serfs who had to
grovel on their stomachs before him,
beating the ground with their heads. It
was romantic —the unknown correspon-
dent writing to him from distant Russia
and Balzac falling headlong in love. It
was passionate —the pair meeting in
Geneva and becoming lovers. It had the
rascally comicality of the Contes Drolati-
ques—notably when Balzac persuaded
the cuckolded Baron that a love-letter he
had written to Madame was a joke and
enlisted the Baron’s support in restoring
him to favor with the “offended” wife.
And, lastly, it was businesslike —for
when Balzac and his mistress parted com-
pany (not to meet again, except at rare
intervals, for 17 years) the decision was
not taken out of regard for the husband’s
honor or the wife’s reputation, but simply
so that, as soon as the Baron should be
kind enough to die, they might marry
with Madame as “the undisputed owner
of Wierzchownia and the inheritress of
his millions.”
It was an affair conducted during the
17 years of separation on a high plane
of fiction—the fiction being Balzac’s
fidelity—and the marriage which ulti-
mately rounded off the novel was partly,
one feels, an artistic rather than an ama-
tory necessity, and largely, as far as
Balzac was concerned (not that he was
unable to deceive himself into imagining
that a passion for a fortune was a love
for a lady), a triumph of finance rather
than of fidelity.
Stefan Zweig, incidentally, seems a little
hard on Madame de Hanska ; one would
require further evidence before fully
accepting the charges of heartlessness and
frivolity he brings against her. She
seems, rather, to deserve some sympathy
as a victim to Balzac’s impetuosity;
which, like the mansion he brought her
to in Paris, blazed with candles and
flowers that could last only for a night.
He was a dying man when he married
her. Though he dreamed of writing an-
other 50 volumes of the Comedie
Humaine it was probably, even for
Balzac, only a dream. His life was lived
out, written out: “I feel like an empty
sack,” he had written five years before
he brought Madame de Hanska home to
the candles, the flowers and the servant
who, like some terrible omen of disaster,
had chosen that night suddenly to go
raving mad.
But the biographer who has dealt with
the romantic fiction of Madame de
Hanska as best he can, who has covered
the rest of Balzac’s amatory excursions,
who has waded through the sea of his
financial difficulties, who has watched
him hiding from his creditors or cutting
a spectacular if somewhat absurd figure
in the fashionable salons with his obesity,
his heavy black mane of hair, his gold
buttons and his “stick as thick as a
club and encrusted with turquoises,” who
has portrayed him in all his tremendous,
joyous gusto as his friends saw him—•
“He was magnificent in his flamboyant,
Pantagruelian way; he had removed his
cravat and his shirt-collar was open;
with a fruit-knife in his hand he laughed,
drank, and carved into the juicy flesh of
a large pear”—a biographer who has
attempted to comprehend and to paint
this outward existence that rolled and
roared and rushed along, ever expand-
ing, like some great flood in the sun-
light, has not begun to portray the real,
the inner and the most fantastically pro-
digal Balzac.
All this rich and tempestuous torrent
of life was for his spare time; it was
crowded into an hour here, an hour
there, a few days in Geneva, a week or
so in Italy between one novel and the
next, another hour stolen from his writ-
ing-table. His real life was his work.
How many volumes was it at the age
of 22? A mere 20, mostly worthless.
At 42 he had written 100 volumes, and
most of them were to be immortal. He
wrote the Contes Drolatiques simultane-
ously with Louis Lambert and Seraphita,
“jotting down a ‘droll story’ on the same
day that he corrected the proofs of his
philosophic novel.” In 1834, just after
Madame de Hanska had become his
mistress in Geneva, he finished La
Duchess de Langeais, wrote La Recherche
de VAbsolu in a hundred nights between
June and September, began on Seraphita
in October, started Pere Goriot in
November and concluded it in 40 days,
wrote Un Drame au Bord de la Mer,
La Fille aux Yeux d’Or, Melmoth Re-
condite and sections of La Femme de
Trente Ans in December and sketched
out the plan of Cesar Birotteau and Le
Lys dans la Vallee; and, over the same
period, he recasted some of his earlier
novels, collaborated in a play, composed
his Lettres aux Ecrivains Frangais and
wrote, says Zweig, 500 pages of letters
and diaries to Madame de Hanska.
In 1846, “with a rapidity remarkable
even for Balzac,” he wrote one master-
piece, Le Cousin Pons, and rushed straight
into another, La Cousine Bette, which
took no more than six weeks. He created
in the Comedie Humaine some 2000
characters.
“Creer, toujours creer!” he wrote to
Madame de Hanska when be was' begin-
ning to break under the strain ; “God
created only for six days and rested on
the seventh.”
Normally, he wrote steadily from mid-
night till eight in the morning. Six
candles in a silver candelabra lighted his
labors and the drawn curtains shut off
the world. At eight he breakfasted,
bathed, and at nine o’clock began revising
the proofs of the previous day’s writ-
ing ; a form of revision which, amount-
ing to meticulous rewriting, has made his
proofs famous among printers as the
Worst in the world. After lunch he
worked again at his proofs, or at similar
tasks till five o’clock. Sometimes, then,
he went out or received a visitor; most
often, says Zweig, he sat alone and
thought about work. At 8 p.m. he went
to bed and slept till midnight. Then the
servant lit the candles and drew the cur-
tains, Balzac donned his long white robe
like a monk’s —from the cord of which,
in place of crucifix and scapular, dangled
a paper knife and a pair of scissors—and
the round began again. Night after night
like that; year after year.
“In a single month,” Balzac said, “I
have to do what others could not bring
to completion in a whole year or more.”
When he was arranging to meet Madame
de Hanska in Geneva he warned her that
his timetable would keep him chained to
his desk from twelve midnight until
twelve noon every day. “When he went
out among his fellowmen,” says Stefan
Zweig,
.it was like the brief respite allowed to a
prisoner when he walks in the prison-yard
for a breath of fresh air. Or, like the ghost
that on the last stroke of midnight has to
vanish back to the dark regions whence it
came, so Balzac returned to his labors after
his interlude of uncurbed exuberance; and
none of those who indulged in irony at his
expense had any inkling of the greatness
of his work or the austere discipline under
which it was carried out. The essential
Balzac was the one who in twenty years,
apart from numerous dramas, short stories
and essays, wrote 74 novels of which almost
every one is of the first rank.
That is how the Comedie Humaine
was written: the greatest body of work
in French literature and, as Stefan Zweig
says, and probably rightly, in all Euro-
pean literature the achievement which
has the best right to stand next to Shaks-
peare’s. Whenever Balzac the man is on
stage in the biography he stands out as a
magnificent human being generous,
prodigal, exultant; but when Balzac
the artist is before the reader’s eyes the
impression is of something more than
mortal: of a different species of man;
of a titanic elemental force; a flood, a
tempest, a volcano. It is the naked spec-
tacle of genius.
And in spite of all the difficulties of
handling such a giant of life and litera-
ture, in spite of the fact that Stefan Zweig
died before he put the book into final
shape, his Balzac does not read like an
unfinished work. There are minor points
—as in some of the Madame de Hanska
episodes ; in the acceptance of Balzac s
testimony on the miseries of his child-
hood without making allowances for his
habit of emotional exaggeration ; in the
condemnation of practically all the paint-
ings and bric-a-brac he collected, and in
the suggestion (emphatically contradicted
in later chapters) that it was chance that
made Balzac a writer instead of “a busi-
nessman or a slave-dealer, a speculator in
real estate or a banker” —where a final
revision would have been desirable. But
these lapses, in the bulk and surge of
the book as a whole, are nothing. Some-
thing of heaviness in the style is likewise
overridden by the color of the material
and the impetus of the drama.
It is an admirably competent book; a
masterly piece of work. It clarifies and
makes orderly the grotesque complica-
tion of Balzac’s finances ; it presents the
love affairs honestly, succinctly, amus-
ingly and, at times, movingly; the por-
trait of Balzac the man and the under-
standing of Balzac the artist, with the
accompanying criticism of his works, are
clear, vital and profound. The biography
reads, as it should, like a last, posthum-
ous novel by Balzac himself; and by no
means the least of his works.
That a book that could have been so
complex and so diffuse is so simple and
so compact is the result, partly, of a fine
piece of editing on the part of Richard
Friedenthal, who has not only assembled
Zweig’sf material but has written in, where
necessary, ‘passages of his own to fill up
the gaps; beyond that, of course, there
is the master-hand and balanced and
penetrating mind of Zweig ; and, beyond
that, Balzac himself; the steadfastness 01
his devotion to his art, the drive of his
tremendous will-power, the undeviating
triumphal march of his genius—the
single-mindedness that made it possible
for his biography to have, amongst all its
diversity, a clear theme, a dramatic de-
velopment, a shapely form. Stefan Zweig
has followed the obvious but almost in-
variably neglected course of portraying a
man of letters as a man of letters; per-
ceiving, for instance, that Balzac’s debts
(like Scott’s) were necessary to him as a
spur to action, and 50 penetrating the
apparent chaos of his life to the sure and
compelling order beneath the surface.
There are mighty laws and rhythms that
govern even the operations of volcanoes.

Untreated netting may be proofed
by immersion in 20 p.c. creosote
solution or in 10 p.c. solutions of
copper naphthenate or creosote and
copper soap in organic solvents;
creosote should be obtainable from
gas companies and the copper solu-

as to leave about 10 p.c. creosote

and 5 p.c. creosote. Creosote should
be handled with gloves because of

Details of early history of Steiglitz
, ( Vic .), and after whom was it named ?
Robert von Stieglitz and several
brothers of a North Ireland family
of German or Dutch extraction immi-
grated to Victoria in 1837. They
settled at Ballan, where they built a
house called Ballan House, and had
several stations in the vicinity. The
town, Steiglitz, was named after them
with a slight difference in the spelling.
In 1875 the town had a school of
mines, a post-office and a population
of 1000, the nearest railway-station
being Meredith, eight miles distant.
Steiglitz has poor soil but was the
centre of a number of diggings and
was largely a mining town.

BIGGEST TYRE
DEVELOPMENT
IN 25 YEARS!
For an unbelievably different ride ... a softer, safer,
smoother ride . . . Goodyear presents the new Super-
Cushion. Super-Cushion is the greatest tyre develop-
ment since Goodyear introduced Balloon Tyres in the
early 1920’5.
Super-Cushion is a bigger, softer tyre that floats along on only
24 lbs, of air. It does what no tyre ever did before —■ Super-
Cushion absorbs crosswise shock! It is less subject to bruising,
cutting or blowouts, and it
gives better road grip.
In tests Super-Cushion con-
sistently averaged greater
mileage than the best con-
ventional tyre.
Super-Cushion the new
kind of tyre for a new kind
of ride—makes a big dif-
ference in the way a car
rides and handles . . . It’s
another Goodyear “first”.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
Tobacco Racket.
“United States News and
World Report” puts it tersely:
“$ll9 million spent in U.S. fox-
-218,260,0001b. of tobacco earns
$2l billion for British Treasury
in tax revenues.”
That’s one of the workings of
the Marshall Plan, with the weed
set “to play an important part in
the reconstruction of - Europe,”
which, by Congress decision, is
to get 458,000,0001 b. of U.S.
tobacco in the first year of the
Plan.
Britain’s share works out at
about 51b. for every man,
woman and child. They, how-
ever, don’t get it (as Australian
tobacco - shops show). The
British Government imposes an
import tax of $11.74 per lb.;
and, says the quoted American
publication, “All of a sudden the
$119,000,000-worth of U.S.
tobacco becomes the equivalent
of $2,500,000,000 to the British
Government for budget-balanc-
ing purposes.”
The publication further ex-
plains the highly-profitable pro-
ceedings: “The tobacco, given
by the U.S., is sold for pounds
to the processor, by the British
Government, at the Govern-
ment’s price plus the import
duty. The processor, in turn,
sells to the distributor, who sells
to the public. In starting this
train of events, the U.S. tax-
payer, contributing tobacco,
does many things. He takes
surplus tobacco off the hands of
U.S. tobacco-growers so that the
price at home can be held up.
He gives the British Govern-
ment tobacco that it can use to
draw a very large amount of
money out of the pockets of the
British people. He enables the
tobacco processor and distri-
butor in Britain to realise
profits of their own [in Britain
and abroad]. And he gives the
Briton a smoke. A Briton pays
the equivalent of 70 cents for a
package of cigarettes that cost
15 cents in the U.S. He pays
for tobacco that, as likely as not,
was given to his Government by
the U.S. taxpayer in the interest
of European reconstruction.”
It seems a good sort of racket
to be in on; but, after all,
tobacco is a remarkable weed.
Soviet Anti-Semitism.
Jewish leaders would not be
deluded by the Soviet lip-ser-
vice support of Dr. Evatt’s prize
U.N.O. botchery, the Palestine
partition.
A leading rabbi in Jerusalem
has stated that many in the rush
to get into the Holy Land some
months back were Jewish refu-
gees desperate to get out of
Russia. Support of the rabbi’s
statement has been given by
former N. Y. “Times” Moscow
correspondent Drew Middleton.
“The extent and intensity of
anti-Semitism in the Soviet
Union,” Middleton has reported,
“are surprising in a country that
boasts of its lack of racial preju-
dice.” He states that the feeling
“is met in the streets and is evi-
dent in Government depart-
ments” ; it “flourishes in Mos-
cow.”
The Soviet anti-Semitism, as
Middleton saw it at first-hand, is
not an announced Government
policy, as it was in Germany:
“But it is difficult to believe that
such widespread anti-Semitism
could exist in so closely con-
trolled a police State if the Gov-
ernment did not give its tacit
approval.”
Announced or not, “it appears
to be Government policy to re-
duce the number of Jews in posi-
tions of influence in the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs”; not only
reduce those already there, but
“Jews are now barred from
joining that Ministry even in
the most subsidiary positions.”
Also, Middleton reported,
“Jews cannot now enter the
principal military academies in
Moscow. Their number is re-
stricted in the medical and law
schools in the university at Kiev
and in Moscow University.” He
adds that Jews trace the start of
the present antagonism to the
treason trials 12 years ago. Leon
Trotsky, they point out, was a
Jew and so were many of his
followers.
China Doublecross.
Debunking Roosevelt con-
tinues hot and strong in the
U.S.; a battering attack from
all sorts of quarters, consistently
sustained since the war ended
and the President’s dealings with
Stalin began to come out.
As merely typical, George E.
Sokolsky, in N. Y. “Sun,” re-
ferring to Jim Farley’s book on
why that big political boss broke
with Roosevelt, quotes it as
showing “that Mr. Roosevelt
was ngt only petty, but that he
believed fishwives’ rumors and
pinioned great events to them.”
A recent comment by the
“Saturday Evening Post” is
also typical; “At Yalta,
President Roosevelt conceded to
Comrade Stalin the right to re-
sume the old Czarist policy of
turning Manchuria into a Rus-
sian satrapy, which the Japanese
had successfully challenged in
1904. So, what China had ex-
pected to get back from Japan,
as one of the fruits of eight years
of gruelling warfare, the Rus-
sians got for about as many days
of real campaigning in that part
of the world.
“President Roosevelt agreed
with Comrade Stalin that the
Chinese were not to be told of
this bargain at their expense until
Uncle Joe was ready to demand
their assent to it. It was about
the rawest treatment of a trust-
ing ally to which the United
States has ever been party.”
Churchill Memoirs.
The Churchill memoirs that
have appeared in serial form in
Australian dailies might fall
short on some points as final
history.
N.Y. “Times,” which has been
running the memoirs and is ap-
parently their chief distributor in
the general syndication, has also
published an article by its mili-
tary correspondent, Hanson W.
Baldwin, questioning the Chur-
chill statements on German pre-
paredness for Hitler’s war ; the
article based on a U.S. Army
staff report prepared for the
U.S. Secretary of the Army and
issued for only limited circula-
tion.
Baldwin admits that the re-
port makes figures in “official in-
telligence estimates” which he
himself used “greatly exagger-
ated.” He quotes it as taking
“sharp issue with some of
Winston Churchill's contentions”
and as showing that “Germany’s
great advantage in the im-
mediate pre-war and early war
years was not in production out-
put.”
The report, “compiled care-
fully from German records,” re-
veals that in 1938 Germany pro-
duced only 3350 combat aircraft,
or 5235 aircraft of all types, in-
cluding trainers and non-combat
types. In 1939, when Britain
was producing 8000 military air-
craft of all types, combat and
non-combat, Germany produced
only 4733 combat planes; or
8295 of all airplane types, in-
. eluding civil aircraft. In the' l,
same year the United States
turned out 2141 military aircraft
and 5856 of all types, military
and civil. Not until 1944, when
the United States produced more
than 96,000 planes, did German
industry reach production peaks.
In that year, despite bombings,
Germany manufactured almost
40,000 planes of all types, nearly
five times its 1939 production.
Baldwin quotes the report as
showing that the same trend, of
small production at the start of
war but of immensely increased
production during the war, is
applicable to tanks, trucks and
other military .material. “Ger-
many was not prepared in 1939
—contrary to democratic as-
sumption—€ or a long war or for
total war; her economic and
industrial effort was by no means
fully harnessed; her factories
were not producing war material
at anything like top capacity.”
“These conclusions,” Baldwin
comments, “are at sharp variance
with some of Mr. Churchill’s
statements.”
Stating that “the full extent of
military armament [by Germany]
by 1939 has often been greatly
exaggerated,” the quoted U.S.
Army study adds:
The total production of all tanks
up to September, 1939, had provided
the German Army with about 3000
tanks, of which only 300 were medium
tanks. When Germany attacked
Poland, the [German] Army had three
Panzer divisions with only 600 tanks
in reserve The German Army had
sufficient ammunition in 1939 to
last six weeks; the Air Force had
bombs enough for three months’
operations at the rate of expenditure
experienced in Poland... .When the
Polish invasion began, Germany had
1000 frontline (serviceable) bombers
and 1050 fighter planes.. Up to the
outbreak of war, the German sub?
marine industry had delivered just 53
submarines to the German Navy....
The actual armament performance
achieved by September, 1939, is not
too impressive. Germany was able to
put more than 100 divisions into the
field in the Polish campaign, but only
three were armored and none was
completely motorised. She had almost
no reserve stocks of ammunition and
equipment But the equipment
which was available was utilised to
the full in the kind of campaign which
Hitler himself conceived as the only
type which the German Army would
have to wage—short decisive action
against one military opponent at a
time But Hitler was not economi-
cally prepared for the new kind of
war he now had to fight (the war of
attrition which replaced the war of
Blitzkrieg after the Germans failed
to capture Moscow in 1941). Hastily
he took steps to enlarge the indus-
trial base of his military might. But
it was too late.
Baldwin sums up on the re-
port that, “while it stands in
sharp comparison to some of
Mr. Churchill’s estimates and to
other estimates,” it does not in-
validate the Churchillian con-
tention that Britain should have
started to prepare long before it
did. The report, he concludes,
“shows that military strength is
considerably more than produc-
tion figures; in fact Germany
won her initial great victories
with a production output smaller
than the combined production
output of her opponents. Or-
ganisation for war, concepts of
war, sound strategy and tactics,
good training and administra-
tion are all important ingredi-
ents of military strength, and
Germany had developed these.
Germany was, on the whole,
quite well prepared in 1939 for
Blitzkrieg war against individual
opponents, but certainly not for
total war against a great coali-
tion, which is the kind of war
she got.”
Trade, or Depression.
From his experience with the
Food and Agriculture Organisa-
tion, former Australian Prime
Minister Lord Bruce has de-
clared in London that “unless a
great expansion of world trade
can be brought about, the con-
ditions of the 1930 s must recur
on an intensified scale.”
That, he said, was “owing to
the increased demand to export
by all nations, particularly the
United States and the United
Kingdom.”
Lord Bruce added that ample
international machinery had
been created to achieve all the
hoped - for objectives; the
trouble is that the machinery is
not working. As an example,
the economic and Social Council
—entrusted under the United
Nations Charter to give leader-
ship on all economic questions
and to co-ordinate the activities
of all the specialised agencies of
the United Nations —has so far
not succeeded in either task. “All
the specialised agencies are
spreading their activities and dis-
sipating their energies over a
vast, unrealisable and imprac-
tical field.”
On what his organisation and
recovery efforts in general are
up against in food alone, he de-
clared that if all known plans
for an increase of food produc-
tion were realised, all it would
mean would be that the world’s
food production in 1951 would
be approximately the same as
that in the years immediately
preceding the war. The world s
population, however, was in-
creasing at the rate of 25 million
a year, and there were no signi-
ficant additional lands to be
brought into production until
great development plans had
been realised.
Socialism Aloft.
Reporting an increase of $25
in the fare for Transatlantic
airline flights despite the fact that
“airlines under the American
flag had been showing an operat-
ing profit on overseas flights and
regretted the necessity of increas-
ing the fare,” N. Y. “Times” ex-
plained the seeming anomaly:
“Foreign operators, particu-
larly the British and French,
have been faced with heavy de-
ficits on their Government-
owned monopolies and have
stood out for the increase for at
least the summer season, when
capacity loads are expected both
ways. On the plea that the
current rate would drive their
foreign competitors out of busi-
ness, in violation of all interna-
tional air agreements arising
from the general act of the
Chicago conference in 1944, the
United - States - flag operators
have agreed to go along on the
increase.”
On which “Saturday Evening
Post” has commented: “In other
words, American private man-
agement—aided by Government-
mail contracts, which foreign
lines also get —has outdistanced
subsidised Socialism, but, in the
interest of courtesy, has agreed
to waive its advantage.”
Palestine Role.
As a N. Y. “Times” corres-
pondent rightly emphasises, “the
decision to liquidate the British
administration in Palestine was
not intended as a mere act of
abdication.”
The correspondent recalls the
British Government statement
that, once Britain occupied in
relation to Palestine the same de-
tached position of the other
Powers, there might arise a new
situation in which Britain might
intervene that is, as a
mediator; the British with-
drawal having been based on the
idea that by no other means
could “the Jews and Arabs and
their supporters abroad be
brought to their senses.”
One expectation in Britain, re-
ported by the correspondent, is
for something on the lines of
British experience in India,
“where there was first slaughter
and then peace, with. Britain
emerging with enhanced pres-
tige.”
Whatever the outcome the
correspondent strongly empha-
sises that Britain’s having with-
drawn from Palestine “does not
by any stretch of reasoning mean
that Britain is beginning a
voluntary retreat from the
Middle East as a whole.”
U.S. Political Parties.
Those who find U.S. Presi-
dential politics confusing enough
might possibly give up altogether
on reading that the Democratic
party was originally the Repub-
lican party.
Like the rest of the hurlyburly,
it’s not as bad as it sounds.
The Democratic party has
been in existence for 156 years.
It was organised in 1792 under
the leadership of Thomas Jef-
ferson. Coming into power in
1800, it retained control con-
tinuously up to 1860 with the ex-
ception of four years, 1840-44,
when the Whig candidate,
William Henry Harrison, was
President, It was, as staged,
originally called the Republican
party. The name Democratic
was adopted after the election
of Andrew Jackson in 1828.
The Republican party, heir to
the defunct Federalist and Whig
parties, was organised in 1854,
taking the old name of the
Democrats. Basing its campaign
on the issue of anti-slavery, it
elected its first President,
Abraham Lincoln, in 1860.
Since that time Republican
Presidents have been in office
during 56 years; Democrats
during 32 years.
Dragnet Digest.
Not for J.B.—A London corres-
pondent of N. Y. “Times” makes no
mistake about one thing emphatic m

Government in Germany and became
“increasingly disturbed” over what
was going on there “under the some-

to 500,000, and “there is no way in
which this constant increase can be
controlled, first because this is a
Catholic country, and second because
the Italian peasant or worker has
always regarded a large family as a
form of old-age insurance.” The hope
is an emigration of 200,000 every
year. “There are almost 2,000,000 un-
employed, many agricultural workers
live little better than animals, and
millions of industrial laborers work
only part time, 20 or 24 hours a

"FREE" MEDICINE.
The essay by the late celebrated Josh Bill-
ings on “Snakes in Iceland” would fit a
description of Senator McKenna’s “free”-
medicine scheme. Billings wrote: “There
ain’t no snakes in Iceland.” And there
ain’t no free medicine.
Every taxpayer is henceforth to pay
the cost of everybody’s medicine, and it
is supposed to be on tap for those who
get a doctor to prescribe it.
How the scheme will work out is not
yet known even to the Minister. He
admits that some medicine may have to
be paid for by the patient, that his com-
pulsory formulary (the bone of conten-
tion with doctors) is possibly deficient,
and that adjustments will have to be
made. The one certain thing is that —
since the fund (aided by consolidated
revenue to an extent still beyond compu-
tation) will have to bear the cost of offi-
cial control as well as the cost of doctors’
fees and chemists’ charges—the medicine
will cost more than by purchase without
official “aid.” There is nothing “free”
about such physicking, and the doctors
suspect they will no longer be free either.
Why the Minister had to get off on the
wrong foot by having a row with the
medical profession is a mystery. His
Pharmaceutical Benefits Act is the first
step in a comprehensive “free” medical,
surgical, hospital, dental and general-
welfare organisation towards which a
National Medical Bill, expected later this
year, will make the next and larger ad-
vance. It is unfair as well as stupid to
antagonise doctors from the outset by
(1) Refusing to allow “free” to the public
those medicines not covered by the formu-
lary, thus (as the B.M.A. declares) ‘-‘mak-
ing the doctor the instrument for depriving
certain patients of the right to ‘free’
medicine because he honestly uses his
medical judgment in prescribing for them,”
and so directing the patient’s resentment
against the doctor rather than the politicians.
(2) Requiring all prescriptions to be
written on Government forms, not the
doctor’s own, thus (says the 8.M.A.)
“placing his private practice under Gov-
ernment control and rendering him liable
to possible penalties under regulations,”
penalties which McKenna’s assurances pur-
ported to remove.
It is on these grounds that the majority
of doctors are boycotting the scheme. In
both Britain and New Zealand under
“free”-medicine legislation doctors are
allowed to prescribe outside the formu-
lary without cost to the patient. Why not
here also? Why in a free-for-all medi-
cine service should the only denial of
freedom be directed against the doctor’s
professional discretion? The Minister’s
stand is the more ridiculous because he is
not restricting to the formulary prescrip-
tions of “free” medicine for patients in
public hospitals or those treated by the
Repatriation Commission, Nor are the
doctors objecting to the formulary sys-
tem ; they use it already in lodge work.
What they object to is being confined to
it.
What is this formulary (or book of
prescriptions) that all the row is about?
Says the Minister;
In its preparation the Government had
the best specialist advice from medical,
pharmaceutical and pharmacological fields.
Against this a leading Melbourne chemist
says “it is based on a combination of the
formularies used in leading hospitals,”
and the Melbourne secretary of the
B.M.A. says:
As a formulary it is poor and limited in
its application. It was prepared nearly
four years ago, and is far from adequate
to meet the needs of the medical pro-
fession. The B.M.A. has different views
from Senator McKenna on the calibre of
those whose “best specialist advice” pro-
duced it.
Certainly the B.M.A. did not help to de-
vise it, and two efforts from that quarter
by way of improving it have been refused
by the Minister —one, last year, which
offered “a list (of additions) under 29 dif-
ferent headings, each containing a number
of items” ; and the other last month, when
the Federal president of the B.M.A. sug-
gested for “free” dispensing “all drugs
listed in the British Pharmacopoeia (or
any other mutually agreed on).”
One Melbourne chemist has reviewed
the latest 100 prescriptions he had pre-
pared before “Free” Medicine Day
arrived. The analysis showed that of the
100:
29 would be covered by the Government
formulary;
19 differed only in unimportant details,
such as ointment base or flavoring;
33 contained “ethical proprietary”
formulas which every patient would have
to pay for himself under the Government’s
scheme;
the remainder were innocuous prepara-
tions for neurotics or others who “had to
be given something.”
What will happen in the big public
hospitals is as yet anybody’s guess. Dr.
Schlink, of Royal Prince Alfred, Sydney,
estimates it may involve that institution
in a loss of £15,000 a year, because “the
Federal Government has so far offered
to pay only £35,000 of the £50,000 which
we spend on medical supplies and drugs
each year.” The N.S.W. Hospital Com-
mission chairman adds that “the State
Government has hitherto met most of the
bills.” The regulations under the “Free”
medicine Act say “the rate of payment
to approved hospitals will be determined
by the Commonwealth Treasurer after
consultation with the State Treasurer.”
Another interesting aspect is that of
the friendly societies, whose officers are
fairly complacent in the larger States but
in Queensland and South Australia dis-
tinctly perturbed. The laws of those
States permit f.s. dispensaries to deal with
the public at large, and under the
“Free”-medicine Act they will be taxed 15
per cent, on their turnover, where hitherto
they have been free. The S.A. Friendly
Societies’ Association has, in fact, been
running a very widespread pharmaceutical-
benefits scheme of its own, covering
100,000 members —two-sevenths of the
State’s electors —and its officials are so
critical of the McKenna scheme that S.A.
“Labor” members’ questions about it are
unhappy and have to be treated Minis-
terially with great care.
In any nationalised medical scheme
there must, of course, be some resent-
ment over interference with long-estab-
lished custom. The ideas the Chifley Gov-
ernment is trying to translate into practice
are not original, or even new. For the
“social security” demanded there must
be some sacrifice of individual indepen-
dence ; but both in Britain and in New
Zealand the fight of the doctors against
assertions of bureaucratic control have
been not only natural from the character
of their profession and their relations with
their patients, but also justified for the
upholding of personal rights properly to
be insisted upon even where some freedom
has to be yielded. The position for the
time being in Australia differs from that
in Britain and New Zealand in that
the wider national medical scheme is not
revealed here yet; and if Senator
McKenna were as amenable to reason as
he has pretended he would not try to
force doctors into a position on “free”
medicine which might fatally compromise
them in coming negotiation with the Gov-
ernment on “free” medical service gener-
ally.
The British general scheme, which will
come into operation next month, has yet
to show its merits. But at least it is based
on a modern approach to the whole ques-
tion of medical and hospital treatment.
British doctors have stood up successfully
to a Socialist Minister who—there, too-
attempted dictation, and they proved they
were right about defects in the British
legislation. Neither there nor in New
Zealand could they be dragooned, nor
will they be in Australia. With the
doctors, in each of these experiments,
lies the fate of the national health ser-
vice, for they know better than any Gov-
ernment department can know how to
make it flexible and efficient.
The corollary to that is that the Min-
ister should appreciate the necessity to
come to terms with them. For his offi-
cials, however expert, cannot make this
scheme succeed. New Zealand experience
offers a stem warning to the Chifley
Government, and Lord Beveridge, whose
disposition is anything but conservative
in this matter, has advised Canberra to
go ahead cautiously.
For the suspicion with which Austra-
lian doctors receive the Chifley Govern-
ment’s scheme Ministers have only them-
selves to blame. This “free”-medicine
project, involving regimentation of all
doctors, was born in the same litter with
nationalisation of banking and the bid
for permanent prices-control at Canberra.
Nor is it, surely, a coincidence only
that the Communists are coming out with
demands that the unions shall “force the
doctors” to do what Canberra wants. In
Perth the Communist party has been try-
ing to intimidate doctors personally, and
the effect has been to stiffen practitioners
there against a Minister whose lack of
frank dealing had already created distrust
and hostility. In N.S.W. several Com-
munist-bossed unions are taking the
same line. These intrusions will confirm
suspicions that the Government’s aim is
quite as much the socialisation of an
essential professional service as the pro-
vision of medical benefits for the com-
munity.
That suspicion is something which
Senator McKenna has to clear up. It is
so easily removed that, if he refrains,
the doctors and great numbers of the
laity will attribute to him only the most
cynical political intentions.
Law That Limps.
Mr. Clarence Martin, the N.S.W.
Attorney-General, used to profess a pas-
sion for law reform. Whoever or what-
ever is to blame, law limps in Sydney,
especially in lower courts, though not
in them alone. Now that chronic delays
in magisterial tribunals have been placed
on public record and have become matter
for argument as to responsibility between
Bench and Bar, Mr. Martin may recap-
ture some of his old enthusiasm for at
least one phase of law reform, until it
oozes out of him again.
In “a special statement,” made at
“Central,” Mr. Oram, speaking for the
metropolitan magistrates he is their
chairman said they were “gravely
concerned about the waste of time and
inconvenience caused by the failure of
some attorneys to attend when their cases
are called,” particularly as the number
of cases listed was so* great —16,000 in
April alone:
The Courts are always willing, within
reason, to try to meet the convenience of
litigants and their attorneys, but -in the
absence of any previous special arrange-
ments these people must be in court ready
for their cases.
To a member of the Bar, who described
himself as “spending most of his days
fruitlessly freezing in suburban courts,'
“this magisterial complaint” was “the
crowning irony”:
All agree that the congestion in suburban
courts is a grave social evil. The following
suggestions would do much to remedy it:
Special days should be set aside for
tenancy and traffic cases.
Evidence should be taken in shorthand.
Cases should cease to be listed on days
already hopelessly overcrowded.
The magisterial morning-tea break should
be reduced, or, better—to follow the High
Court in habits as well as in law —omitted
altogether.
So there are faults on both sides, but
faults in the nature of effects rather than
causes. The guilty party, in the main,
is the “ ‘Labor’ Government.” It would
be the duty of any Administration, how-
ever composed, to remove the effects and
strike at the causes; and this “ ‘Labor’
Government” is one-third lawyer in com-
position. Yet it looks on idly at “a grave
social evil,” denies magistrates, prosecu-
tors, defenders and parties the services
of shorthand-writers —witnesses strange
to Sydney court customs find it hard to
restrain themselves when their testimony
is taken down in longhand and read out
slowly to them afterwards, a process pro-
longed by corrections—and never gives a
thought to police procedure, or to ten-
dencies which criminals exploit: over-
done mercy and laxity in the granting of
bail.
And under this regime, whereas the
Communist strike leaders concerned in
the recent Brisbane unlawful-assembly
cases were dealt with summarily, delays
being refused, the corresponding cases
against 14 of the 15 men arrested after
the Sydney Domain basher-gang outrage
nearly 15 months ago were still dragging
on at the end of last week.
This basher-gang outrage was an inci-
dent of the wharf strike, ordered in con-
tempt of the Stevedoring Industry Com-
mission, which held up 88 ships, some of
them laden with perishables for the Aus-
tralian market and with food for Britain,
for a fortnight. On the ninth day, two
Liberal members, A. D. Bridges, M.L.C.,
and E. D. Darby, M.L.A., called a public
meeting in the Domain, having first
obtained permission from the police and
the Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Graham.
Though 70 police were present their
meeting was broken up, and they and
many bystanders were assaulted, by a
mob from the waterfront, which after-
wards surged up to the nearby Parlia-
ment House, intent on intimidating Minis-
ters into ordering the release of the 15
men taken into custody.
Protesting in the Council that night,
Mr. Bridges was accused by the Minister
of Justice, Mr. Downing, of having
“raised the matter for the sake of gaining
political notoriety and kudos”:
It is improper for Mr. Bridges to discuss
the merits of the case and seek to place
the police at a disadvantage.
This extraordinary Minister neverthe-
less “assured” the bashed M.L.C. “and
honorable members generally” that “this
Government will see to it that the law
is enforced” ; and a similar “assurance”
was given by his “leader,” Mr. McGirr:
Some of those who offended against the
provisions made to preserve the right of
s free speech were arrested, and appropriate
charges have been laid against them. They
will be dealt with in the same way as
any other lawbreaker.
The “appropriate charges” boiled down
to one—unlawful assembly. Six months
elapsed before a conclusion was reached
in the first case, that of a wharflaborer
named O’Sullivan; and during the six
months and all the ensuing months he
and all the others were out on nommal
bail. Convicted on police evidence—
he was heard to say “We had better
go over and break up their meeting,
and seen to punch Darby and push
Bridges from the platform O Sullivan
was awarded a month. A month for a
ringleader in a riot in a public place, and
at a meeting guarded by police!
And that was not the end, for the
fellow appealed, and the proceedings
against the other 14 men were straight-
way suspended. The appeal was not
decided till May 27. 1948. when convic-
tion and sentence were upheld, the Judge
remarking that unlawful assembly de-
signed to prevent free speech “by means
of intimidation or injury” was “a most
serious matter,” and that the magistrate
had not been “too severe.” Six days later
hearing of the charges against the 14
was resumed —and adjourned for a week!
This way of “seeing to it that the law
is enforced” is right into the hands of
Communists and fellow-travellers, but it
amounts to or can amount to a denial of
justice to the people. And, as Mr.
Menzies could testify, the basher-gang
affair is by no means the only case in
which reputed Communists and fellow-
travellers charged with offences against
the right of public meeting have been
given the benefit of unconscionable and
scandalous delays which encourage their
entire mob to laugh at the law as en-
forced” in Sydney by “Labor.”
A Recipe for Bankruptcy.
Mr. Chifley is going to legislate for an-
other Commonwealth Shipping Line on a
basis forecast in these columns last De-
cember. An accompaniment is to be a
Government shipbuilding industry under
the Shipping Board, which will, as Mr.
Chifley said last year, “retain general
supervision over coastal shipping as re-
gards freights and schedules.” Nation-
alisation of all shipping, we are now
assured, is not intended ; “there is ample
opportunity for both Government and
private lines.” But loss of the Prices and
Charges Referendum must have restricted
the Government’s “opportunity.” 5
About 12 months ago Senator Ashley s
Shipping Department was busy “assem-
bling evidence for submission to Cabinet”
to prove that the statistical record of
losses by the old Commonwealth Line
was all a horrible libel on Government
management, since these losses were
“mere book-keeping entries.” Boiled
down, this was the story of that mess of
the past according to the Auditor-
General :
Original cost of fleet, 1917 onwards,
£15,000,000.
In 1923 written down in value to
£4,749,350 and transferred to control by a
Trading losses, 1921 to 1928, £6,721,305.
Final sale to the White Star Line at a
further devaluation. When that co. went
into liquidation there remained unpaid, and
not recovered of the purchase price, another
£400,000. , , . . . .
Loss on Cockatoo Island dockyard,
appendage to the Commonwealth Line, was
£60,000 per annum till it was leased to a
private company, when the dockyard pro-
vided a rental to the Government which was
as much as £43,264 for 1946-47.
From these accounts (“book-keeping
entries,” but paid by the taxpayers all
right), Ministers have descried rich pros-
pects for a new Commonwealth Shipping
Line, and into that the Chifley Socialist
Government is planning to enter with
what is regarded as this favorable start
(figures from Auditor-General):
Cost of 12 River-class and 2 D-class
ships (to June, 1946) —£12,191,255, or £lOB
a ton. , _ .
Add cost of 1 River-class, 4 Ds, ana
2 Bs, since completed, and computing at
same cost per ton —£3,348,000. .
Loss on 20 wooden ships built m las-
mania and Westralia, built at about £70,000
each (14 of them sold at about £ll,OOO) —
£1,200,000. ... . .
Loss on running of ships requisitioned by
Department up to June 30, 1946, £6,765,987,
with a debit of over £2,000,000 indicated
for 1946-47.
To these (in Canberra’s view) happy
omens may be added points made by one
Australian shipping company after
another in survey of the post-war in-
dustry. As compared with 1939 (leaving
1919 out of sight) a ship working on the
Australian coast today

the ships are run to provide travel tours,
with pay, for the gentlemen who consent
(if talked to nicely) to sign on as seamen.
Taxpayers can now look forward to
annual bills suggesting that the Chifley
Government of peace-time costs them
hardly less than a full-sized war.


PLAIN ENGLISH
"Controls" or Enterprise?
If proof were wanting that the Chifley
crowd has been on the warpath against
the States it is to be seen in the reaction
to the referendum vote. The socialisation
campaign as planned has been knocked
endways; this bid for permanent control
of prices was the key to it.
The Commonwealth Government is
not merely 'piqued. It is in a very
bad temper. It says almost in so many
words: “If we can’t have permanent con-
trol, we won’t use even our legitimate
temporary powers.” The Minister for
Customs threatens that controls will be
“rigidly enforced” for the next two
months—or is it three?—and then let go
with a snap. With one ear open for the
next uproar within its own ranks and both
eyes on the plank it will soon have to
walk, the Canberra Ministry is praying
with united fervor that the States will
fall down on the job.
Too bad that a people the Socialists
thought they had strung up as puppets
should revolt so ungratefully! What
rotten luck that, just as it seemed a
revolution was being produced under
anaesthetics, the Australian electors pro-
vided a cpunter-revolution of their own!
And the electors were so happy over it
that when, through official overconfidence,
the first act towards socialisation of the
medical profession appeared on the very
morrow of the referendum, nobody
appeared to notice it or to care a cuss
about controlled “free” medicine.
The States need not worry. The people
are sick of controls of every sort, and the
States’ best course will be to preserve as
few of them as possible. Only the Mc-
Girrs in N.S.W. are in a panic. They
had looked forward to a term of office
without any special cares. McGirr ex-
pected that he -would have to do no more
than stonewall for three years while the
Canberra crowd at the other end made
the runs for both. Now he has got to
do something off his own bat. If con-
trols are to be continued he will have
to develop some sort of collaboration
with the other States, sometimes with
Liberal Governments.
Coal is going to give these control-
artists much to worry about. Will Chifley
abandon his subsidies on coal, which sup-
port the cost of miners’ uneconomic
wages, wilful absenteeism, and luxurious
holidays? Will he abandon his joint
control with N.S.W. of the coal industry?
Of course he won’t. And if coal sub-
sidies stay, why not subsidies on butter
and potatoes and milk? And if the
miners carry out their threat to withhold
coal from “anti-‘Labor’ States” it won’t
matter much whether there is price-fixing
of any other commodity or not. The
great majority of electors who have so re-
cently spoken their minds at the refer-
endum will know then, from the manner
in which the Socialists give vent to their
resentment, that the defeated controls
were designed and exercised for political
ends.
The farcical and wasteful price-fixing
regime must' be abandoned some day,
and that day may just as well be now.
Until this control-doped public, like a
convalescent patient too long abed, gets
up and starts moving again on its own
legs it never will recover. What if some
costs do rise at first —as they inevitably
will do if artificial restrictions are sud-
denly released? The public has the cure
in its own hands by buying as little as
possible where prices are excessive. Sub-
sidies keep costs up ; only competition
in a free market will bring prices down,
and the sole hope of that is higher pro-
duction. For the destruction of all in-
centive to higher output, through all this
past three years since hostilities ceased,
the responsibility lies entirely with
Chifley’s exorbitant taxation and with
the Chifley Government’s accompanying
suppression of all free enterprise. It is
astonishing that Australians have stood
it for so long.
The architect of this stagnation now
tells the country that because it has
thrown off his yoke of controls and
clairned its freedom it is facing chaos.
A cheer for “sweet chaos”!
✓
Financial Domination.
The financial domination of the com-
munity by the central Government at
Canberra was highlighted last week when
Mr. Chifley revealed that Federal revenue
for the current financial year would ex-
ceed estimates by ££6 million, and that
instead of a deficit of’£3o million the
Budget would this year balance, after
allowing for an increase of expenditure
of £l6 million.
The striking thing is that revenue should
be underestimated by a sum of the magni-
tude of £46 million —and £25 million of
that income tax —especially when it is re-
membered that total Commonwealth in-
come tax in the last pre-war year was just
over £ll million. On latest figures, after
the States have been handed their in-
creased refunds, the Commonwealth will
have £lBl million .of income and social-
security tax to play politics with, as well
as £177 million of other taxes. Total
Commonwealth taxes in 1938-39 were no
more than £77 million —slightly more than
a fifth of the current year’s estimated
collections.
Never were a more doctrinaire or
extravagant crowd in charge of the spend-
ing of stf great a sum of Australian tax-
payers’ money. With how little real re-
sponsibility the Treasurer himself ap-
proaches the task of administering the
national purse was shown last week when,
without a decent regard for the economic
consequences, he proposed to drop price-
control with embarrassing haste following
the people’s rejection of his scheme for
permanent Federal control of prices.
There was no need for such precipitate
hurry in the matter. Mr. Chifley was
narked about the whole thing, and he
behaved like a nark,
Australians don’t want narks and
Socialists left with the spending of £358
million or more (loans additional) of their
money annually, especially where it is
used to set up obstructions to their desired
way of living. They want to have re-
turned to themselves, through taxation
reductions, a large part of the spending-
power taken from them during war-time
and retained by Mr. Chifley during the
three years of peace. It has been pro-
tested from Canberra for a long time that
heavy taxation was a counter to in-
flationary spending. But inflation is not
prevented if spending-power is merely
transferred from the individual to the
bureaucratic State. In many directions
it is stimulated.
It is not right, either, that a Govern-
ment which has abetted the militant
“Labor” movement in reducing the pro-
fr U „ C sS ,y
is the failure of industrial output to keep
Zi pTir
ana paper credits. Successive Labor
Governments have had most to do with
the creation of excessive paper money.
Rut tbev bave failed nfterbr in
mit tney nave tailed utterly to stop the
rot in the decline in national productivity,
a decline promoted largely by trade-union
bodies from which Canberra “Labor”
takes its orders.

"Convicted Criminal" and

—, , ,
On the demand that the Minister for
Transport and External Territories shall
be temporarily suspended, pendente life.
from control of those offices, Mr. Chifley
tells Parliament that he is “not going to
accept the word of a convicted criminal”
against the Minister, -whether he was
a friend or a political associate of the
Minister at one time, or not.”
“At one time” is good! At least there
is no doubt about the friendship and
association. That does not depend on
the word of any “convicted criminal.”
“Don’t be silly, Jock.”
It is not controverted either that Gar-
den was one of his election-committee
bosses, and had access to Ward’s Minis-
terial room and his stationery on that
account.
Aqd how rough is this “convicted
criminal” stuff in Chifley’s mouth to-
day! During every Parliamentary session
for years past Chifley or one or other
of his Ministers has been defending
Garden against all suggestions of his
unfitness for responsible Government
employment. To take only two ex-
amples: here is Chifley defending him
two years ago half-way through the

correspondence belonging to a depart-
ment in which Garden was not employed.
It was so lax, too, that an outside in-
dividual, employed on Ward’s affairs in
his constituency, could, with or without
the Minister’s approval, use in that
private business hired cars three nights
a week for which the Government paid.
The probity of the whole Chifley Ad-
ministration is impaired while the Prime
Minister maintains his false and com-
promising stand that he will not suspend
Ward from office pending the court cases,
or order an examination of the conduct
of the External Territories Depart-
ment. The Governor-General ought to be
moved to force the Prime Minister’s hand.
Meanwhile the Opposition parties have
decided “not to raise the matter in Par-
liament,” but to issue a public statement
outside, although “a vital principle is
involved.” Those parties ought to be
ashamed of themselves; their diffidence
is but poor witness to their expressed
sense of impropriety and of offence
against “high traditions of Parliamentary
government.” Where better than Parlia-
ment to raise their protest? To their
credit three Liberal members, led by Mr.
Cameron, did independently protest in
Parliament.
What it means is that the Govern-
ment’s name is mud. The Prime Minis-
ter cannot but be aware of that, and
he doesn’t care.
POLITICAL POINTS
BAD LOSER!
There’s this about Ben
That’s plain as a steeple —
He’ll never again

By Keane, dollar-clever,
By Urquhart’s hire-cars,

Chifley is expected to receive a com-
munication from the N.S.W. Bar Counsel
for referring to Simon Isaacs as a “larri-
kin lawyer.” On January 23 questions
asked by Simon Isaacs in court brought
the following replies from E. J. Ward;
“That is a lie”; “You’re a liar” ; “No,
you’re a dirty liar” ; “You’re a liar” ;
“You’re a dirty liar” ; “That’s a lie” ;
“It’s a lie” ; “You’re a liar.” The Chifley
notion is that a barrister who asks ques-
tions which produce such answers must
be a larrikin.
Macmahon Ball, whose favorite line
from the poets must be the one about
“Pardon, the son of Reprieve,” is reported
in Asia'again, this time as a bearer of
Evatt benevolence —£500,000-worth of
scholarships and textbooks, and gifts of
clothing and footwear. From Batavia,
Macßall, plumage and all, flew to Singa-
pore, and was there assailed with cries that
his mission was a “mockery” and his
gifts the coin of Judas, since Dr. Evatt’s
colleague Calwell had insisted on deport-
ing Malays.who married Australian girls.
Some of the Malays were on hand with
raspberries for the “goodwill mission.”
And the boss missioner can’t disown Cal-
well, nor, while Calwell is about, can
he plead acceptably that Dr. Evatt’s heart
is bursting with love for the Small
Nations, which ope and all accept his
Leadership.
Premier Hollway and Cormack, presi-
dent of the Victorian Liberals, have in-
vited the Country party, through Mc-
Donald and Lockhart, to come in with
them on an equal-in-all-things basis.
They can point to the example in South
Australia, where a united front against
compulsory collectivism in all its forms
was achieved long ago and has never been
seriously disturbed. All the sam|, it
would be a mistake to force the pace.
In the first World War Newfoundland
was a Dominion and its Prime Minister,
Morris, sat in the Imperial War Cabinet
with Borden, Hughes and Massey. In
later years it fell on evil days and had
to be placed under commission rule. At a
referendum on the future form of gov-
ernment, 53,000 Newfoundlanders were
fof reversion to Dominion status, 49,000
for confederation with Canada and
18,000 for continuance of the present
arrangement for at least five years. That
means another referendum, with the com-
mission-rule question dropped. It looks
as if confederation with Canada will win
in the end, though there is a section favor-
ing economic union with the U.S.A.
Nowadays a third of the inhabitants of
“the oldest English colony” are of Irish
origin.
What exactly are (or were) the duties
of a “liaison officer” (“Labor”)? In
Garden’s case they are still uncatalogued,
as it were. The mystery was deepened
last week by Garden’s appearance as a
witness in the case of a German, a Trade
Commissioner before the war, who
“appealed against a magistrate’s finding
that he had assaulted a neighbor by spit-
ting at her.” The German pleaded inno-
cence of the spitting because “at the time
stated he was at Garden’s office to talk
about some piping,” Garden’s version
was that “Brundahl came to my office in
the Commonwealth Bank Building,
Sydney, a little after 11.30 aim. on
October 15 to see about getting some
piping.” The Judge (Stacey, J., by an
odd coincidence) found for the lady;
“appeal dismissed; conviction con-
firmed.” Some piping!
From a Canberra report on Balts put
on the Community Hospital staff:
Most of them have proved ’ extremely
good employees. Others are being sent to
work in South and West Australia.
It rather suggested a revival of the Sys-
tem, but it was merely that delightful
thing the Canberra touch.
Shelley (or was it Spenser?) has been
described as “the poets’ poet,” Can there
have been such a functionary in these
parts as “the fixers’ fixer”?
After a year of “nationalisation” of
coalmines the British taxpayer is brood-
ing on the results or such of them as he
has been permitted to learn. Among
these are a change of Ministers, resigna-
tions from “the board,” all-round re-
criminations, two price-increases per ton
(the first 45., the second 2s. 6d.), no pro-
duction-increase (output per man is fully
a third of the American figure) and a
colossal deficit, still to be calculated and
detailed. A recent estimate was that it
would reach £20,000,000. It is now ex-
pected to go to £25,000,000.
Police broke into a Brisbane room
occupied by an outfit with a high-sound-
ing title and found it equipped to supply
racing information to nearly every s.p.
parasite in Queensland. There were
seven (7) telephones, two of them direct
lines to the G.P.0., used by nine (9) bene-
ficiaries of “Labor’s” “full-employment”
policy, who were let off with fines averag-
ing under £l2. Scores of thousands of
people who work and pay taxes can’t
get a phone for business or household use.
Playford, his South Australia so short
of coal that rail, gas and electricity re-
strictions worse than any experienced dur-
ing the war have had to be enforced,
hurried to Sydney and tried to move
the Joint Coal Board. He asked for a
chance to build up a 10,000-ton reserve
of N.S.W. coal. Since allowing anyone
to have a coal reserve is dead against
Miners’ Federation policy, the Premier
might just as well have stayed in Adelaide
and saved his breath.
Through Lord Pakenham the British
Government has warned the Tommy
husbands of Russian girls forcibly sepa-
rated from them that they may never see
their wives again. Britain has made 18
appeals for the couples to the flinty
Stalin, all to no avail. And there are
people who still believe that Stalin’s rule
is based on his love for the people and
their love for him.
Hopeless as the prospect is, the N.S.W.
Shires Association is to ask Canberra
to return all petrol-tax revenue to the
States, for construction and maintenance
of roads. The tax is 10|d. a gallon and
last year brought in £15,750,000, nearly
£10,000,000 being “diverted” to consoli-
dated revenue. Going about the country
during the referendum campaign N.S.W.
C.P. leader Bruxner found the roads in
a bad state and local-body finances
frightening.
It would seem that the country is to
be harrowed by the spectacle of a militant
union-leader electing to die of a rup-
tured appendix rather than submit to
treatment by a doctor declared “black”
by the A.C.T.U. because doctors won’t
have the “free”-medicine racket in its
present form. Or it would almost seem.
Baddeley, the McGirr’s coal-fish-grey-
hound wizard, spoke like a man-mountain,
of confidence to a “press conference”
on Chifley’s petulant decision to abandon
prices-control to the States:
Why all this fuss and bother? There is
no need for panic. We’ll take all this in
our stride.
The only things Baddeleys take in their
stride are the screws they raised and the
pensions they voted themselves against
defeat or retirement.
Dalton, who resigned as Chancellor of
the Exchequer—the No. 2 position—be-
cause he had thoughtlessly betrayed a
Budget secret to a press pal, is back as
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
Ward is still in.
One of these Conciliation Commis-
sioners may yet have to decide whether
an egg is a factory or a land product.
Carter Brothers, who send about 30,000
eggs a day from Werribee to Melbourne,
have been declared “black” by the
Storemen and Packers’ Union because
they won’t reinstate a shop steward and
provide him with a house on the farm.
They are resisting the boycott, and their
own union (Primary Producers) is backing
them to the limit. It had to come to that
sooner or later, and Werribee may make
history.
At Gladstone (N.Q.) the wharfies have
actually been- working 11 hours a day
loading frozen meat which accumulated
during their strike. That, of course, meant
bulging pay envelopes, but according to
a medical report issued by their “vigil-
ance officer,” ’flu and “other sicknesses”
have so prostrated Ashley’s pets that they
must really take three days off this week
for rest and recuperation. The fact that
Gladstone show and races occur at the
same time is merely coincidental. Any
wharfie sighted at either will be there as
a convalescent.
People in four States have heard De
Valera on his favorite theme, the iniquity
of partition in Ireland. In Sydney he
spoke to 7000 people at the Stadium.
Nothing was wanting from the proceed-
ings but a bit of comit relief. That could
have been provided by Calwell, who is
agin partition in Ireland and hot for par-
tition in Palestine —and didn’t his “Gov-
ernment” help to bring it about, as far as
his “Government” could?
Thousands of listeners to the Parlia-
mentary debates must have felt repaid
for enduring many dreary monologues
from other lips by Archie Cameron's
stern protest against the retention of
Ward in office; but one of Cameron’s
allusions may have puzzled many:
The appointment of the former member
for Cook, Mr. J. S. Garden, to a position
in a Commonwealth department has been
the subject of question after question in
this House. The member for Balaclava,
Mr. White, has raised the matter repeatedly.
I myself have not raised it, because of
certain action I tried to take on the day
after I was sworn in as a member.
On November 28, 1934, the man from
Barker gave notice of “the following
motion of privilege”;
That the blasphemous and treasonable
statements of policy and intention, pub-
lished by John Smith Garden in various
papers, from time to time between 1920
and 1930-, render John Smith Garden unfit
to occupy any office under the Common-
wealth, and the seat for the division of
Cook is declared vacant accordingly.
An objection came from Beasley, and the
Lyons Ministry weakly yielded to the
gentleman who was to become leader of
“the non-Communist ‘Labor’ party.”
Lines from an Old Digger:
Inland Australia can take heart from the
referendum voting. Here in Nyngan (N.S.W.),
ordinarily a “Labor” stronghold, there was a
surprising “No” majority. It is a sign that the
country has had more .than enough of city
rule, which nowadays so often means Com-
munist domination. And though Nyngan is a
long way from Armidale, people here note
with appreciation that there will be a New-
State convention at Armidale in the last week
of the present month.
A note from Kew (Vic.):
Brown, the Communist boss of our Railway-
men’s Union, is claiming the world’s skipping
record. Anti-Corns found two flaws on his
performance, as published: (1) he stayed in the
one place; (2) he stopped.
A Victorian Assemblyman’s inquiry in
rhyme;
Who gets the income
From Sydney Pincombe?
It has been referred to the Service Depart-
ment, together with a request for informa-
tion as to what owners of hire-cars
engaged by a Minister’s agent charge the
taxpayers for “electoral work.”
The effect on N.S.W. coal production of
“giving the workers everything they ask
for” shows up in statistics extracted in the
Senate from Ashley. Output in 1941, when
“Labor” came in a couple of months
before the miners knocked off for their
annual holidays, was 11,766,000 tons. In
1947 it was 11,683,000 tons. “Industrial
disputes” numbered 392 in 1941 and 812
in 1947. Working days lost last year, in
the best conditions two sympathetic
Socialist Governments could provide,
totalled 351,303 —say, a thousand years!
Phillip-street, Sydney, “where now the
studious lawyers have their bowers,” is a
prey to rumors that the president of “the
Australian Russian Society” will succeed
Chief Justice Jordan when that able ser-
vant of the State retires. McGirr and his
Attorney-General Martin had better not.
McGirr, at least, should be old enough
to remember a Bar protest which secured
the withdrawal of a “Labor” appointment
to the High Court Bench —that of the
late Piddington.
The Federation of British Industries,
like the ironmasters in U.S.A., have
undertaken to reduce their prices volun-
tarily, at the expense of profits, in order
to combat the inflationary influences
which have left Governments powerless ;
all they ask is public, and especially Gov-
ernment, assistance, the latter through re-
duction of crippling taxation and ex-
asperating interference of “controls.”
Their hopes are slim. Under Socialist
demands private enterprise is not to be
allowed to restore the national economy,
but must be destroyed.
Another of those notes from sarcastic
correspondents—there’s quite an accumu-
lation of them this week:
Touching that remark about Ward being
unable to speak at King’s Cross, Sydney
(B. 26/5/’4B), 1 suggest that it was neither
influenza nor laryngitis that prevented him
but a common-or-Garden cold.
It came from Brisbane.
In comment on the prosecution of a
price-fixer, which collapsed because
Crown witnesses refused to give evidence
incriminating themselves, it was stated
(B. 2/6/’4B) that Chifley did not
reply to representations made by Beale.
For the period referred to (the matter was
raised on Feb. 25) the statement was true.
On May 6 the P.M. did reply—not materi-
ally rebutting the facts adduced —in “cir-
culated answers to questions,” not avail-
able until “Hansard” arrived. And
“Hansard,” though a very worthy publi-
cation, always arrives late.

When Professor James Arthur Prescott,
Director of the Waite Agricultural Re-
search Institute at Urrbrae, near Adelaide,
gives the W. J. Farrer memorial oration
at the Agricultural Bureau Congress at
Hawkesbury (N.S.W.) shortly, he will also
be presented with the W. J. Farrer memo-

Leipzig Unis., was the Ministry of Agri-
cultural Research Scholar at the Roth-
amsted Experimental Station 1912-16,
Chief Chemist of the Royal Agricultural
Society, Egypt, and Superintendent of the
Bahtim Experimental Station from 1916
to 1924, when he was appointed Professor
of Agriculture at Adelaide Uni. He’s
been soils chief of the C.S.I.R. since 1929,
and became Director of the Waite in ’3B.
Prescott has published many papers on
soil fertility, soil classification, and the
principles of crop production and
climatology.
Just back from a job which he may
never see completed is Garnet Argyle
Soilleux, of Melbourne, who helped—with
Russians, Swedes, Uruguayans, English-
men and Chinese —design the U.N.’s
“Tower of Babel” in New York. As top
architect of Commonwealth Govern-
ment’s Works and Housing he has had
some unique jobs, among them the plan-
ning of a new Darwin and helping to lay
out the rocket range in S.A. He has a
flair for the unusual —the crying-rooms
to which mothers take their babies in
cinemas were his inspiration, and he has
taken part in almost every big yacht race
in Australian waters. a job as
wireless-operator in the merchant navy
helped to pay his university fees. In the
last war he helped build airstrips’ from
Morotai to Hong Kong.
In Washington this week Senator Van-
denberg will be using all his political
skill and all the authority his prestige can
command to persuade the U.S. Senate to
restore the cuts made by the Representa-
tives in the amount of aid for Europe
voted under the Marshall Plan. It’s the
sort of role he has been accepting willingly
m the last few years, and playing super-
latively well, though the 1948 Vanden-
berg must occasionally get a shock when
he catches sight of his pre-war self in the
shaving-mirror. In those days, and for
all his political career before them, he
was an arch-isolationist. But he is no
man for half-measures, and when Hitler
and To jo forced a change of heart and
mind on him it was a complete one.
lie now believes that since America cannot
isolate herself she must co-operate whole-
heartedly with those countries that think
more or less as she does. He was one
ot the U.S. delegates to the San Francisco
conference and he helped to sell the U.N.
idea to the Senate. As chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee he
has been pushing the Marshall Plan for
all he is worth. Vandenberg is a big
ngure in the Senate and in his party,
and, despite the more publicised claims of
Stassen and Dewey, it would not be sur-
prising if the Republican Convention later
this month named him as the party’s Pre-
sidential candidate.
Melbourne Town Hall platform, which
had already been graced by a singing
policeman and a singing hairdresser,
was honored at the last “celebrity” con-
cert of the A.B.C. by a ’cello-playing
publican. The Bung concerned was Laud
Kennedy, who returned recently to music
hcenseeship of a pub at Taree
(JN.S.W.), which he and his wife Dorothy
took over after they returned from Cali-
fornia, and, unable to find a house,
took to hotelkeeping. World-famous,
Kennedy is Professor of the Royal College
or Music, and made his debut in New
York in 1920. He and his wife have
oeen artistically associated since he played
m the orchestra of “Faust” in Adelaide
over 30 years ago. He has been solo prin-
cipal for the 8.8. C. with the London Phil-
armomc, and has made many world
tours. His son John gave up the law for
music, and is now principal under Mal-
olm Sargent. Kennedy reckons beer-
Purveymg has helped his playing—“it rid
me of the musical indigestion brought
on by 25 years of concert-playing.”
“Becks” on a new Lawrence of
Arabia:
Glubb Pasha hit the world’s headlines, with-
out in the least wishing to do so, when the
Arab Legion crossed the Allenby Bridge into
Palestine; but his name has been a household
word in the Arab countries for years. John
Bagot his parents dubbed the infant Glubb
in 1897 ; the tribesmen have a more picturesque
name for him—Abu Haneik, which means
roughly Father of the Bad Jaw. A youngster
at Woolwich when the first German war broke
out, he went to France with the Royal Engineers
and collected a Military Cross and three
wounds, one of them a gunshot wound in the
jaw, the legacies of which are a big scar on
the chin and his Bedouin nickname.
When the first war was over Glubb went to
Irak, first in the Army and, after 1926, in the
a 3 u Admmistl 'ative Service. He studied the
Arab languages and customs, became an ex-
pert linguist in all dialects and, like Lawrence,
became deeply interested in archeology. In
1930 he transferred to Transjordania, then under
British mandate, and before long was right-hand
rnan tp Peake Pasha, commander of the Arab
a u B i°n ? nd Political adviser to King (then Emir)
Abdullah. Peake went "‘hack to England in
1939 and Glubb stepped into his shoes. Dur-

Unlike the British officers called out of
action in Palestine recently, Glubb is not on
loan to Transjordania; his contract with Abdul-
lah is a personal one, and he cannot be con-
trolled as the others were. John Bagot Glubb
is on the Reserve of Officers List; Abu Haneik *
is not.
“Acker B”: Denis O’Duffy, the Aus-
tralian giant, was recently reported to
have been inconvenienced on his trip
from New Zealand by the fact that his
bed, specially made to accommodate his
Bft. lin., had not accompanied him on
the plane. Some time ago at Flemington
races the hatless Denis was the cynosure
of all eyes at the bar. As he enjoyed a
drink I noticed that a rafter was gently
“parting” his hair. At subsequent meet-
ings it was my wont to point out the
rafter and explain to friends that I had
once seen a man at the bar whose head
touched it. For this information I re-
ceived anything from plain incredulity
to sheer abuse. Looking at a normal per-
son standing beneath the rafter I found
it hard to believe I was not pulling my
own leg. Alas, the rafter was in that
portion of the grandstand that was
burned down, and with it went my oppor-
tunity for a bit of gentle earbashing to
vary the tedium of a losing day.
Placed on pictorial record herewith is
Alexander William Jessep, MAg2-.Sc.,
B.Sc., Dip. Ed., Government Botanist of
BOTANIST.
Victoria and Director of the Botanic
Gardens. His leafy domain, originally
a swamp and billabong of the Yarra,
turned by the genius of Guilfoyle into
one of the world’s most beautiful public
gardens, and by Von Mueller into a treas-
ure-house of Australian and foreign flora,
is still as to plan largely as Guilfoyle left
it, though much has been added—the fight
always goes on between the scientific and
the aesthetic. Even royalty has been
given accommodation. The King and
Queen planted a Tristania conferta, the
Duke of Windsor a Stenocarpus (in Eng-
lish, a Queensland wheel-tree), Melba
a golden poplar and Paderewski a pink
chestnut. The Duke of Gloucester made
his contribution, but fatality always seems
to dog the Duke’s arboreal efforts, and
whatever it was it perished. In recent
times there have been the Sunday after-
noon concerts which attract audiences of
upwards of 120,000 and which have
moved music-lovefs to propose the mak-
ing of a Hollywood bowl—which the
present director wouldn’t tolerate for a
moment. Jessep was educated at the
University of Melbourne and Marshall

remarked on this page:
He doesn t show any signs of the row

said of another man well known in East
Sydney, “as fluent as a waterspout.”
Ernie Old, veteran Melbourne cyclist,
ended his 6000-mile overland ride from
Melbourne to Fremantle and back via
Sydney in a blinding rainstorm in time
to record his vote on “No”-day. Last
year he pedalled 6000 miles from Mel-
bourne to Darwin, and made a short trip
to Brisbane. This year to date his tally
has been 15,000. Biggest trouble on his
cross-continental journey was travellers
who stopped him to engage in conversa-
tion, which forced him to adopt night-
riding. He has covered every main route
on the mainland—the Apple Island is too
small for his ambition —and is contem-
plating America for his next half-million.
He is 73. Frank Gavan Duffy once said,

Adelaide University’s Vice-Chancellor,
Albert Percival Rowe, 0.8. E., de-
picted here by Coventry, is an English-
man who took an honors degree in
physics at London University in 1921
and went to the Air Ministry to do re-
search work in aeronautics. During the
war he was engaged on telecommunica-
tions work and had a hand in the de-
velopment of radar; at the end of the
war he was scientific adviser to the
Admiralty. Last year he came to Aus-
tralia as chief scientist in the long-range
weapons project at Salisbury (S.A.) and
went on to Melbourne as chairman of
PHYSICIST.
the scientific advisory committee of the
Defence Department. Rowe likes the
open air, hates overgrown cities and con-
siders Adelaide about the ideal size. He
used to play cricket, and if encouraged
boasts mildly of the time he took eight
wickets for 12 runs. Pressed for further
details he reveals that the occasion was
a village-green match.
Contractor Hal Levinsohn, building
new landing-steps at Admiralty House for
the King and Queen, began his mechanics
at Fort-street High, then on Observatory
Hill. Adding three years to his age, he
left at 16 and joined the 17th Battalion,
serving in Egypt, Arabia and France.
Back home in 1918 his first building
job was the explosives factory at Mari-
byrnong, which ammunitioned the Aus-
tralian squadron in the last scrap. Next,
job he really regards as important was
when, as a sig. sergeant of the Eighth
Divvy, he rebuilt the bombed roof of
his unit’s quarters in Selarang Barracks,
Changi. The Japs demanded on a ques-
tionnaire occupations and professions of
all guests. Exhorted by their sergeant
to hide real jobs, one sig. gave his civilian
occupation as “painting parrots on
Arnott’s biscuit-tins.” None of this im-
pressed the Nips, however, and Levin-
sohn’s wasn’t the only constructional
knowledge in camp by the time the Burma
railway was finished. Rescued in
October, 1945, he had a tropical ulcer
cleared up in Yaralla, then formed his
own construction company, which is now
replacing old Man-o’-war Steps. Admi-
ralty House steps will retain as landward
foundation the old sea-wall built by- the
convicts. The only reconstruction needed
was concrete filling of underwater cracks
gouged by a century of sea-fretting.
Into the Silence:
In Melbourne, at 63, Charles H. Merrick,
sporting journalist for almost 40 years, on the
“Age” for 18. A former secretary of Richmond
Rowing Club, he founded Sandringham Athletic
Club’ in 1929, and most Stawell Gift followers
remember him as the bloke who went for his
early-morning swim there whatever the weather.
In Melbourne, at 88, John William Grey,
who tested the first Westinghouse brakes fitted
to the State’s trains in the last century. He
was on the first electric train to run from
Brighton to Essendon.
In Brisbane, at 63, Ernest F. E. Sunners,
chairman of Queensland Meat Industry Board.
During the war he was Deputy Meat Controller
for the State. A loss to the Australian meat
industry.
In Adelaide, at 73, O. L. Glastonbury, sec-
retary of the Adelaide Cement Company, and
former president of the Australian Institute of
Secretaries. He joined the Cement Company
as chief clerk and accountant in 1915, and
became secretary 23 years ago.
At Croydon (Vic.), Agnes Rowe, whose
literary collaboration with her brother lasted
for 37 years. Between them they wrote boys’

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Plop”: Build a forest of all the sob-
bing sheoaks that our city poets have
ever thought of, and you still would not
have a dolorific duplication of the sniffles
from ladies “enjoying” the first half of
our flicks on Saturday night. At
interval I bolted for the foyer
and lit up, smiling at the sight
of a matron tucking away her hand-
kerchief. From habit I gave my eyelid
a rub with my thumbnail and a micro-
scopic thread of tobacco must have fallen
into the eye. It stung, that eye watered,
and the other joined it out of sympathy.
I’d rubbed them both and blown my nose
several times before I noticed the sniggers
of my fellow-smokers. It had just dawned
on the when a chap from work touched
my elbow and started chatting. Then
he noticed my ruddy optic. I told him
about the tobacco, but got the response:
“Oh, yeah! Brother, you’ll never live
it down.”

“H.W.M.”; Haigh Bfos., the 94-year-
old tailoring firm of Melbourne, has de-
cided to close its made-to-order depart-
ment because of shortages of materials
and inability to secure apprentices to
the high-class trade for which the firm
has long been noted. In days when
tailors and tailoresses Were more easily
found Haigh’s made clothes for Governors
and their aides, but some of the aides
didn’t pay. One, a debonair Lord, the
firm decided to sue, and as an office-boy
in the law I was sent to Government
House to serve a summons. His Lord-
ship was brought to me as I waited on
the steps, and, in an affable manner, he
asked: “Well, my boy, what do you want
with me?” “This,” I said, clumsily
and apologetically, as I shoved the bluey
at him. Taking a look at it he replied,
“Ah, yes, yes, yes. It’s from my old
friend Haigh.” And then, graciously,
“You must be hot and thirsty, boy ; come
in and have a drink.” I was escorted into
Government House to slake my thirst in
lime juice and soda; his Lordship then
saw me off the premises and waved me
goodbye. I don’t think Haigh’s ever got
their money, but I have had a tender
spot for real live Lords ever since.

“Mike Rikey”: Nicknames are not the
only things that stick (B. 7/4/’4B). Much
of the humor and speech that was born
during the war is now a permanent fea-
ture of our daily round. Evidence of
this was apparent in a shop that
fared badly in Adelaide’s hurri-
cane. Without windows, and with por-
tion of the roof missing, it presented a
tattered look reminiscent of the blitz
days of London. The effect was height-
ened by a n'otice in one of the boarded-
up windows. It read: “More open than
usual.”
* * * *
“Bo”: The bottled-blonde flapperette
with the streamlined chassis had been
a week in the job and had thrown her
lack of weight around with plenty of
vim, her natural self-confidence receiving
an unnatural boost from the knowledge
that these days any typist dan walk out
of one job and be received in abject
gratitude by plenty of firms which are
willing to offer them as added inducement
to stay anything from free perms to
shopping-time. At about ten o’clock one
morning the manager emerged from his
sanctum, a bundle of papers in his hand,
and made for the flapperette. She was
lolling back in her chair, her crossed feet
stretched before her, plying an emery-
board on her nails. She glanced up coolly
as the frowning manager stopped in front
of her, then examined the hand she d
been at work on in calm appraisal. “Miss
Fetherbrane! ” thundered the trump.
“Didn’t I ask you to do some filing this
morning?” The bottled-blonde leisurely
shifted the gum to her other cheek, looked
up in open-eyed wonder, left aloft the
emery-board and drawled: “Well, what
do you think I’m doing—frying an egg?”
* * * *
“Bagot”: Whether the language is
piade in the streets and pubs may be
debated, but there is no question that
real humor is often found in those places.
In a Perth bar I heard two chaps arguing
the merits of a couple of pugs. “I tell
you,” said one, “the Basher was good ;
he fought Les Darcy once.” His pal came
back with: “I don’t care if he fought the
Archbishop of Canterbury; he was still
a dud.”
* * * *
“Uco”: I seem to have trodden on
“J.K.’s” corns in referring to Adam Lind-
say Gordon as a minor poet (B. 2/6/’4B).
Possibly there is a misconception in his
mind as to the meaning of the term, which
"Helpr
is in no way derogatory to A.L.G.’s
memory; but if he really means that
Gordon’s verse is of a quality to earn
him a place among the few to whom
the title of major poet is accorded, he
has produced rather flimsy supporting
evidence. Teddy Roosevelt was a great
American patriot, but his reputation as a
literary critic is not very substantial. As
to Gordon’s “nearly fifty editions”—Ella
Wheeler Wilcox’s “Poems of Passion”
probably found 100 buyers for every one
of “Bush Ballads,” yet neither “J.K.” nor
myself would consider this proof that her
work had greater merit than Gordon’s.
Those memorials? Well, the Mt. Gam-
bier obelisk marks the spot where the
poet and his horse made their celebrated
leap, not where the great horseman wrote
his verse. Finally, lam asked what other
minor poets have a tablet in Poets’
Corner. The place is littered with them,
as well as with tablets to others who are
not even minor. Has “J.K.” heard of
Mason, Davenant or Shadwell?

“0.W.W.”: While the Kiwis are break-
ing entertainment records at Melbourne
Comedy (B. 12/5/’4B) an Australian show-
in N.Z. is putting up an amazing record
in another type of amusement. Nine
months ago Sole Bros.’ Circus arrived in
the North Island, and so great was the
public welcome (no circuses had toured
the country for nearly 10 years) that
two provinces, Taranaki and Waira-
rapa, have not yet seen the show, which
is due to go into winter quarters in Auck-
land in a few weeks. Showing in Auck-
land city at Christmas, the circus played
six weeks to packed houses despite polio-
myelitis restrictions on young patrons.
* * * *
“Ceg”: Debtors flitting by early-morn-
ing trains (B. 12/5/’4B) took me back to
a Victorian bush town. Our debtor was
a plausible customer who had been living
in, the town for months. He was sup-
posed to be interested in something
“scientific,” and used frequently to dis-
appear for two or three days, always
leaving two suitcases with the publican;
he emphasised that they contained valu-
able equipment. Then the publican
put it on him for something on account
—he hadn’t paid his hotel bill for two
months. He was “into” the bank for
a few pounds and owed money all over
the place. Next day we heard he had
joined the early-morning train at the
next station. Creditors commiserated with
each other, but the publican remained
bland and smiling. “I’m all right,” he
said. “He owed me sixteen quid, but
I’ve got his two suitcases in the cupboard
under the stairs.” We decided that the
cases should be opened to see whether
there would be anything over after the
pub bill was satisfied. There wasn’t. The
cases were full of bricks wrapped in
copies of the “War Cry.” We let Bung
keep the lot.

“Lim-limbu”: One of the few organi-
sations in active production in New
Guinea at present is the word-coining
section of the Administration. Latest
effort appears in N.G. Gazette
(23/12/’47), in which a man who holds a
permit to exhibit a motion-picture is re-
ferred to as a “Permittee.”
* * * *
“Ingot Ike”: The form of snobbery
which often changes the quite good name
of a street or town to something which
causes generations to grin
seems to have infected the S.A. town of
Whyalla. Part of it is known as Cactus
City, and a committee has been asked to
“suggest a more suitable name.” The
old name was bestowed in some con-
tempt, the area being “out in the salt-
bush,” but such names frequently become
worthy ones. The prospect of Cactus
City becoming Lewistown or Playford-
ville or Little Unley or something equally
commonplace should cause Whyallans to
re-examine the existing name —which isn’t
a bad one and would give a local Dreiser
something to play with.

. “Galah”: These “Find-the-ball” com-
petitions remind me of an incident which,
if photographed, would have set a real
poser. In a city park a game of foot-
ball was in progress, half the partici-
pants being barefooted. The ball was
passed to one of the barefooted, who,
to show contempt for the soft-footed-
ness of his better-shod companions,
promptly “sunk the hoof” with consider-
able force. The ball lifted for about
2ft. off his foot and then fell deflated to
the ground. In the pierced cover and
bladder was found embedded half an inch
of unhygienic toenail.

“Clooter”: Some sort of a row is blow-
ing up between the S.A. Cricket Associa-
tion and S.A, Football League because
the cricket body won’t allow portable
radio-receivers on Adelaide Oval during
football matches. S.A.C.A. bans the
things under a Government Act forbid-
ding the playing of musical instruments or
doing anything likely to annoy or disturb
any person attending a sporting fixture.
Why football fans should want the
things is beyond me, and I strongly sus-
pect the hand of the s.p. bookmaker,
who would naturally want his patrons to
hear how their favorites ran. Radios
are banned from Adelaide race meetings
—where they were used to pick up inter-
state race broadcasts; when they do
appear they are politely seized and handed
back to the owner after the races. Me?
I’m for the cricketers. Not once or
twice in my rough Australian story I’ve
had my nerves shattered and all enjoy-
ment spoilt at some open-air fair by loud-
speakers, and today the mere sight of
the things is enough to drive me away.
It is significant of the gambling disease
that at our golf club I’ve seen players cut
out the eighth hole and run a quarter-
mile across country to the teahouse at
the ninth in order to catch a race broad-
cast, repeating the performance at the
17th and 18th. The spectacle of a star
Adelaide half-forward about to go 'tor a
mark and then running away from the ball
towards the fence to hear how Lionsmeat
runs in the “Flyin’ ” ought to be enough
to deter anybody.

“Bohemian”; A prisoner has been
tried under unique circumstances in
the Magistrate’s Court at Westport (M.L.).
When the court orderly was opening the
door of the dock the key broke. As it
would take hours to remove the broken
part, and then more time to secure
a new key, the magistrate ruled,
despite opposition by the defendants
counsel, that the prisoner could be tried
outside the dock. It is claimed that
never before in the history of Maoriland
courts has a prisoner stood his trial out-
side the dock,

“Eureka”: If you want to discover
anything about an historic structure in
any part of Australia, don’t waste your
time by asking the local residents. Often
when snapping an historical building
or monument I have spoken to people
living nearby, only to find they knew
nothing about the thing I was photo-
graphing. I was taking a picture ot
an old pump, in a reserve in front of
Victoria Barracks, Paddington (Sydney),
when an old chap told me that he
had often wondered what the pump
was there for. He had seen it almost
every day for 40 years, yet had not
bothered to read the inscription. It
was erected in 1868 and is one of the
few remaining relics of Sydney’s early
water-supply. Residents of the dis-
trict came with buckets, and water-
carts distributed the water to out-
lying parts.. Excavated by W. I- Martin,
the well had a splendid supply of good
water and the pump was never known
to go dry.

“E.S.S.”: She was a brisk, b«stling
type of woman and she wasted no time
when she approached the young man in
the department store. In no uncertain
terms she told him just why she did not
like the overcoat they had sold her hus-
band. She even told him that she sus-
pected the store of getting rid of old stock
simply because her husband had shown
more acquiescence than commonsense.
Never again would she let him shop;
men had no shopping sense. She
plumped the bulky parcel into the young
man’s arms and asked for a cash credit.
As the young man had not returned 15
minutes later she hailed a supervisor.
After hearing her description of the man,
and questioning his staff, the supervisor
said regretfully: “I am sorry. Madam,
but the young man doesn’t work here;
he must have bee'n a customer.”

“Macnell” on a link with the past;
Old Man o’ War Steps, in Sydney Cove,
are being demolished; a concrete struc-
ture will replace them. For 100 years war-
ships have landed their liberty-men on this
point, but the Steps themselves date much
further back. In 1817 Macquarie laid
the foundation-stone of the fort on Benne-
long Point, now reduced to a tram terminus,
and before that built for his private use nearby
a small landing-place which he called Man o
War Steps. Its little beach was named Lachlan
Cove, and here Macquarie’s children sailed their
boats. What is now the Domain wall was
then beach and salt-pans, where the colony s
salt was garnered by evaporation. Small vessels
careened on the beach, and in 1850 female
immigrants from England landed on the Steps
and were marched through the Domain to
their reception barracks. The Steps have re-
ceived the mighty and the fallen. All our
Governors since Macquarie and all our Admirals
used them as a private landing, and many a
sailor, zig-zagging Step-wards after the mid-
night boat had left for his vessel at No. l
Buoy, stood under a light and waved to me
quartermaster. Soon a furtive figure 'would
slide over the ship.’s quarter-boom and a skin
would break from the shadow of her sides.
But though officially the Steps belong to Gover-
nors and G.-Gs. the Duke of Gloucester
landed there from an Admiral’s barge—their
history and use are essentially naval. Men ot
cruisers Perth, Sydney and Canberra, and de-
stroyers Nestor, Waterhen and Voyager, ail
sunk, embarked from the weatherworn steps,
and men of the old Australia, Sydney, Mel-
bourne and Brisbane before them. On August
11, 1900, Captain Creswell of the cruiser Pro-
tector, ordered north to take part in the Boxer
-Rebellion, shipped his 96 officers and men m
cutters there. In 1850 there were m Sydney
six frigates and sloops of the Royal Navy. The
Steps saw their straw-hatted crews and felt tne
’ disciplined slap of boats-crews’ calloused teet.
Since then sword-girt captains, landing for a
court-martial, companies for a city march, gun-
carriages for a naval funeral, ships’ football
and cricket teams, all have answered the routine
pipe: “Boat for M.O.W. Steps is now along-
side.” When in the course of the present
demolition, the shore-end of the steps was
lifted, two rotted beams set well into me
sandstone of the Domain wall were discovered.
They pointed at an angle to the line of the pre-
vious pier, which had obviously been redirected
to allow more water for bigger boats. Owing to
the beams’ great age—two pieces pf iron, origi-
nally lin. spikes, are rusted to a third that size—
it is safe to assume they are part of Macquarie s
first landing. The new concrete pier tfffi have
steps of borer-resisting turpentine wood, ana
will carry petrol pumps, fire-fighting service and
telephone cables to No. 1 cruiser-buoy. Pdes
of the old pier, that part of them silt-covered
as sound as when they were sunk, will go to
feed Sydney’s winter fires.

PIPARDS.


“Gravelsnatcher”: That sheik who, as
reported in my daily, offered to barter
two good camels for an air-hostess prob-
ably did so in the knowledge that not one
white man in a thousancfcan pick a good
camel. One who could was Lawrence of
Arabia. During the Kaiser’s stoush a
young A.I.F. officer was sent with a
patrol to meet Lawrence at a Red Sea
port. Mounted on camels which were
reputed to be the fastest obtainable,
they made the trip across the desert
in 16 days, a record beaten only by
Lawrence himself. By using short-cuts
and risking death in sand and gorge, he
did it in 48 hours. The party reached the
rendezvous, camped and turned to abuse
an old Arab who rode his nondescript
camel through their lines to ask, in a
cultured English voice, for the young cap-
tain. Later, about to leave, the “Arab” —
Lawrence —criticised the patrol’s mounts
and smiled tolerantly at the officer’s
heated defence. “Now that’s a camel,”
he said, indicating his own mount. “You
don’t think so? Watch.” He whistled, and
the camel took off. Gathering his volu-
minous skirts in his hands, he raced along-
side it for a few paces. Then, as the
camel got into stride he raised his left
foot, gripped the animal’s hind leg with
his toes, and swung himself on to its
back. They left the camp at a speed
that brought incredulous grins to the
patrol’s faces. That was the secret of
Lawrence’s standing with the Arabs—to
take a trick from the Bedouin’s repertoire
and beat him at it.

“W.P.T.”: These Miss Australia and
bathing-beauty competitions seem to be
judged on beauty of face and figure and
a few other qualifications ; but I reckon a
far more interesting competition would
be to find the real Miss Country Girl.
"I'll unlock it when the pubs shut, and not before!”
She would have to be between 18 and
38 years of age, able to milk six or more
cows an hour, cook a good damper, cook
underground mutton so that you would
take it for chicken, lift a bucket of milk
in each hand and at the same time balance
a basket of eggs on her head. Extra
points would be given for performance
at the woodheap, for feeding poddy
calves, killing and dressing a pig, making
butter and stripping wattle-bark. The
tyinner would have so many proposals
from cow cockies that she wouldn’t have
time to take a trip to Sydney for the
show.

“Pitt St.”; A heavy lorry rumbled
down Sydney’s Market-street, petrol
pouring from a gash in its tank. It had
to halt for the cross-traffic at Pitt-street
and passed on, leaving a pool about the
area of a fair-sized room. Then came
the inevitable chump and—yes—tossed
down a lighted match to see if the
stuff would bum. He saved himself
with a frantic leap, somebody else
saved two women by a whisker, and
flame ran along the roadway. It caused
a neat little traffic jam, drew a curious
crowd and burned itself out. Then the
furious traffic-cop looked round for the
chump. But chumps—like drunks —bear
a charmed life.

“Beecham”; Theatrical props and
accidents, is it? Back in 1923 Dan
Thomas was dame in the pantomime
Aladdin at the old Shaftesbury Theatre,
Perth. Slip, one of the Chinese police
pair Slip and Slop, had to hit Dan (as
Widow Twankey) over the head with his
truncheon—a weapon made with one half
wood (to be struck smartly on the stage)
and the other half of padded cloth. But
one night Slip slipped, and Dan got a
smart smack on the cranium with a solid
piece of jarrah. Having to keep his re-
action down to a mere whisper was prob-
ably one of the hardest jobs of Dan’s
career. But when the scene was over he
let himself go. I know; I was Slip.

“Ray Whiting”: The night club 6n
Mt. Carmel, over Haifa, turned it on pro-
perly, and about 2 a.m. I’d had it, so went
looking for my mate; he’d vanished, so
I tottered home to the pub alone. At
the break of dawn he reeled in, collapsed
on the bed and snored. A little later
the phone jolted me into a world of
cocky-cages and revolving door-knobs and
a lady wog’s voice trilled, “ ’Ullo! ’Ullo!
Is Mistaire there?” I croaked that
he was—partly. “Will you please re-
mind ’im that the duel is at seven
o'clock?” Click. I shook the body on
the bed. “What’s all this about a duel?”
A pair of bloodshot eyes waved at me.
“Eh? Cripes, yes —I swiped a Greek
loot. He pinched my bint,” and, with a
“Hell, I’m crook!” he staggered to the
shower. Refusing company, he went out
alone. It was lunch-time when he re-
turned and swallowed a three-finger
Scotch. “Cripes,” he said, “a bloke does
some cranky things.” I’d give a lot to
know the end of the story, but he’d
never tell.

“C.A.G.”: In Melbourne a donkey
bearing a colorful rider on some
publicity stunt staged a “stay-put” strike
at the Bourke- and Swanston-street inter-
section. Policeman and passers-by spent
at least an hour shoving, advising and en-
ticing with.carrots and ice-cream. Cars
swerved and drivers swore. But apart
from the latter’s hurtful remarks, treat-
ment of the stubborn cause of chaos dis-
played commendable tolerance and good
humor in all concerned. In England last
year I saw a similar incident when a
swan quitted the Thames to stroll along
a busy street right in the middle of a
tram-track. A line of trams was soon
behind swan and schedule. When a bobby
shooshed the bifd it stopped and hissed
back. He tried to shove the offender,
and wisecracking onlookers joyfully wit-
nessed his hasty retreat before beating
wings and pecking bill. The swan con-
tinued its walk and trams gained a few
yards. Traffic resumed its normal course
only when the bird decided to waddle
back to the river. But London’s best
1947 animal antic featured a small terrier
which trotted along six miles of under-
ground from the Angel to Clapham Com-
mon with a train a few yards behind.
The stationmaster at the Angel phoned
the next station, “Stop him.” But as the
Moorgate S.M. hung up the little dog
raced past—the train crawling behind.
On the Bank platform people waved
arms and umbrellas, but on went the dog.
Report at Kennington was: “Dog run-
ning well. Not tiring.” At Clapham
Common, 11 stations from the Angel,
“Youll have to dress yourself, Cedric —
Jenkins is on strike .”
it leapt on to the platform, ran past
porters, up an escalator, and into the
street. The train took 50 minutes on its
20-minute journey.

“Nubis”: Perhaps modern editors are
too “refained” to indulge in vitriolic
writing (B. 21/4/’4B), but the art is not
altogether lost. The following is taken
from the “Opinion” column of Perth’s
“Daily News”:
If the miserable misfit and menace to
society who purloined my boy’s new suit-
coat during the barbecue at Yanchep on the
evening of March 27 would care to cal), we
will give him the rest of the suit. The pants
are pining for their mate.
I know the sarcasm is not new, but it is
usually more politely phrased.

“Flathead”: Some years ago I went to
a wrestling match with a friend who
“knew things” and told me that the main
bout was rigged. “In the fourth round,”
he said, “Runamok will climb up that
ladder on the far ring-post as if to attack
the announcer in the box at the top, but
when he is half-way up he will turn
and jump down on Abdullah Murphy,
winning the bout by two falls to one.”
It was hard to believe—all those cries
of anguish that Runamok let out as
Abdullah rubbed a peanut-shell in his
ear —but, sure enough, in the fourth round
he headed for the ladder. Unfortunately
he slipped from a high rung, fell into
the ringside and sprained bis back.
But I was finally convinced that prize-
wrestling is phony by a current news-
reel which shows a Yank matman who
wears his hair in a permanent wave. This
man is alleged to be a savage profes-
sional wrestler, and although he has all
the eye-jabbing and elbowing tactics pat,
he couldn’t go half a round with one of
those amateurs whose hair-do is similar
and who charge our evening bus with
their murderous wedge. When the Yank
knocked the ref. out with a kick in the
teeth he actually helped him on to his
feet again.

“Woody”: Goebbels felt the winter of
1942, too (B. 5/5/’4B). His diary re-
cords, his feelings: “This long, hard,
cruel winter be damned.” Australian
p.-0.-w. who spent their first European
winter in Austrian Tyrol concurred,
though their references were rather more
colorful. Single-walled pine-huts offered
little warmth when the temperature
dropped well below zero. In our billet
the bolt-heads and nails on the inside
were covered with ice, dixies of water
indoors froze solid overnight. Potatoes
were as hard as stones and turnips had
to be “peeled” with an axe. Black bread
got so hard that chunks had to be chipped
off like lumps of hard clay. Breath froze
on the blanket-tops, leaving them cold,
damp and uncomfortable around one’s
chin. Probably to get rid of surplus
stocks in the off season, a small bottle
of beer per week was made available dur-
ing that winter, and, like anything else
not used as a covering on the bunks, was
usually placed beneath whatever served
as a pillow. I have known the stuff to
freeze solid overnight and crack the
bottle, causing one bloke to complain that
he would have to go out of business as
his liquid assets had frozen.

“Harold Hardupp”; A chap who has
died at a good old age was fond of
speaking of himself as “the last of
the lamplighters.” In days when the
man with the long rod patrolled the
streets to get the gaslamps
going at sunset and turn
them off after daylight, the
lamplighter was an impor-
tant civic identity, his job
regarded as a plum at a
screw of “£7B per annum,
rising to £lO4 p.a. in ten
years.” This old chap
claimed he got the job out
of over a hundred appli-
cants ; but, then, his dad
had been lamplighter for 30
years before him. Tackling
the “pushes,” which held that
hurling half-bricks at the
street lamps was a good
sport, was one of the haz-
ards of the job; and this
chap had a spell in hospital,
with subsequently a grant of
a whole £5 “as a recognition
of his zeal in the perform-
ance of his duties,” as a re-
sult of one go with the larri-
kins. When the arrival of
electric lighting scrapped his
job the Council transferred
him to another, but he had
the same feeling about the
new illuminant as old-time
horse-grooms had towards
cars; he tossed in all his
accumulated prestige as a
civil servants to take another
lamplighting job in a
country town. According to
his records the light of his
old calling gave its last
flicker about 20 years ago ; he then found
refuge with a big industrial firm as what
was really a caretaker, though the firm,
to satisfy his idiosyncrasy, put him on the
paysheet as “lamplighter.”
* * * *
“P. Turs”: As an ex-manager of the
dignified movie mosque in Sydney (B.
26/5/’4B), I am reminded of another in-
cident connected with its water-playing
fountain during my term of office. A
small boy, obviously spoilt, was using
his foot to spray water on to patrons
waiting for the next performance when
in a dignified voice his fond parent chided
him; “Mont-gom-eray, stop mucking
abart.”
* * * *
“Pronto”: After long experience I
have discovered the best form of protec-
tion against debt-collectors —choose the
right type of landlady. I fell back in the
instalments on my encyclopedia and ex-
pected the worst. The other morning I
was in the front parlor when the collector
called to repossess. He struck my
guardian at a bad moment; she must
have burnt the scones or something.
When he announced his mission, “Over
my dead body, young man! ” she purred.
Then she really let go, and he fled in
confusion.
**. * *
“Zake”; Three “raids” in succession
had produced in the lugubrious-looking
ticket-inspector extreme irascibility at
the delay of passengers in finding
their tickets. On the fourth visit
the friendly quartet of regulars who
always sat in the rear smoking compart-
ment of the tram exchanged winks when
they saw the cranky official get on the
front of the car. Five minutes later he
had worked his way along to their com-
partment, and at his surly demand to be
shown tickets search began among the
four. The first man eventually located
his ticket in his hatband; the second
found his at last between his signet ring
and finger; the third produced from his
mouth a pulp the ticket number of which
was still faintly visible. The fourth
slowly went through his three outside
coat pockets, his inside breast and ticket
pockets, the four outside and note
pockets of his vest and his three
trouser pockets. No ticket. The by-now-
ropable inspector reached eagerly for his
little book, but the passenger peremptorily
held up his hand and, maintaining that
he had it somewhere, again slowly and
laboriously dredged the thirteen pockets.
Still no ticket, and with a woebegone
look he shrugged his shoulders. With a
threat that it would mean prosecution for
trying to evade his fare the inspector
chokingly demanded name and address.
It was then that something dawned on
the passenger’s memory. With a flick
of his fingers and a “Got it!” he lifted
his left foot, took off his shoe and pro-
duced from the toe of it the proof of his
fare-payment.
CASTLES IN RUMANIA.
“Last week, while press correspondents were trying
to decide whether the marriage between ex-King
Michael of Rumania and Princess Anne of Bourbon-
Parma was to be celebrated, postponed or abandoned,
it was announced, that Michael had been dispossessed
of his throne, 159 castles and 4000 acres of land in
his own country.”
Cold times are these for kings whose erstwhile
vassals
Have given them the push, distressed and
broke.
To lose a crown and throne with all the tassels
And trappings of a royal job’s no joke,
And then to forfeit quite a crowd of castles,
A hundred and a half at one fell stroke,
Seems like the sort of penalty that’s felt
To be above the odds, below the belt.
Had it been Carol, now, that unrespected
Of gay Lotharios and debauchees,
He who so long and shamefully neglected
His conjugal responsibilities,
One doubts if anyone would have objected
Or held him victim of unjust decrees,
But Mike, for all we know, unlike his dad
May be a really estimable lad.
Could they not leave, whatever his offences,
A single one, in coming years to stand,
Of all these castellated residences
A link between him and his native land,
A sort of shield against the consequences
If e’er his restoration should be planned?
Ex-kings may stage a comeback. Any dunce
Can tell you Carol did it more than once.
He’s lost a crown with all its prized extranea,
Castles a hundred and a half beside,
This ruler of a modern Ruritania,
But he has gained—or has he lost? —a bride.
And just what makes a castle in Rumania
Or what degree of splendor is implied
By that high-sounding term I can’t define.
Your guess is probably as good as mine.

Defeat of the Federal Prices Referendum
may leave control of electricity (and other)
charges in Queensland in the hands of
the Stat# Government, where they belong.
For this purpose, and to co-ordinate ex-
tension of current throughout the south-
east of the State, a Government commis-
sion was set up before the war, and is
now assisted by a series of regional
boards. Much has been accomplished,
and a lot more is to be dofie, in taking
current wherever it can be economically
taken and in establishing new generating
stations.
This City Electric Co. is the executive
instrument in the scheme covering the
south-east portion of the State. The co.
also holds a long-term franchise cover-
ing the Tweed River district* over the
border in N. S. Wales. Its job is to
attend to generation, reticulation and
other technical problems upon which the
efficiency of the undertaking depends.
Divs. are fixed by legislation at 2 p.c. above
the rate for Commonwealth loans volun-
tarily subscribed during the previous year.
Prices for current —10 p.c. above Bris-
bane rates in country areas —are calcu-
lated on this basis, after allowing for
exes., depreciation, a moiety (1 p.c. on
capital) for reserves and cost of pref. and
debenture money. It all means much so
far as security is concerned, but, while
public policy remains one of cheap money
and the cost of living continues to rise,
this formula for calculating the wages of
capital operates counter-clockwise to the
formula for reckoning the wages of labor.
Steady at 5j p.c. for the last seven years,
the div. will drop to 5} p.c. for the cur-
rent term.
The story last term was one of marked
expansion and increased sales and effi-
ciency, with materials, labor and costs as
the limiting factors. The £198,486 (up
£39,439) of profit covered pref. and ord.
divs. on the increased capital, with £40,639
to spare —£5669 less than the co. was
legally entitled to put to free reserves.
Net increase in the depreciation reserve,
etc. (£1,867,591), was £149,022, and £Bl6
net was added to debenture exes, tem-
porarily capitalised (£4053). The recent
12i p.c. lift in metropolitan tariff rates
is expected to “barely cover” increased
costs.
The year’s expenditure on capital de-
velopment ran to £851,071, of which
£341,980 was on generating plant and the
balance on reticulation, etc. —£121,972
metropolitan, £331,742 country and
£55,377 Tweed district. The outlay was
met mainly by addition of £456,065 to
share capital (the remaining 15s. on
608,087 £1 ords. put out in Nov., ’46) and
of £300,000, carrying only H p.c., to the
list of secured debentures. With an ap-
proved works programme of £5,745,000-
odd ahead, 1,013,479 new £1 ords. were
issued at par, one-for-three, shortly before
the close of last accounts. When all the
money on that lot is in paid capital will
be £4,053,915 in 20,000 6 p.c. and 125,000
7 p.c. prefs. and 3,908,915 ords. In front
of the shares is £1,512,000 of debenture
stock, which is likely to be increased by
a further £500,000 before shareholders are
asked for more.

With one eye on the co.’s past perform-
ances and its present strength, financial
and otherwise, and with a twinkle in
the other one, the market notes the con-
traction of £3087 in last term’s net earn-
ings and continues to offer 675. for the
pound shares, visibly covered by 31s. 9d.
in net tangibles. The immediate return
at 675. is 3 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis ;
and there is nothing at the moment to
suggest either a lift in the div. or other
benefits.
Over the last quarter of a century the
history of the business has been a very
pleasant one. No less than £250,000 of
reserves has been capitalised (in 1924
and 1928) and £354,133 of inner reserves
disclosed—last shake-out was four years
back when £lOO,OOO, previously reserved
against advances, was dropped into visible
accumulations. The div., steady at 10
p.c. for 13 years to the close of accounts
in 1931, dropped to 6 p.c. during the
slump, then rose to 10 p.c. again in 1938,
and has remained steady since. Also
purchase of hotel properties and absorp-
tion (in 1938) of the Walkerville Co-op.
Brewery, an up-and-coming competitor,
widened and tightened the co.’s grip upon
the trade, while growth of population,
following industrial expansion in S. Aus.,
and war, inflation and a buoyant national
income have helped to bump up turnover
further.
The per-capita consumption of beer
in Australia increased from 10.34 gallons
in 1936-37 to 15.94 gallons in 1946-47.
Here are official details (Commonwealth
Statistician) covering the last three years:
1944-45. 1945-46. 1946-47.

Consumption increased by 19.9 p.c. for
the 12 months to June 30 last, and there
isn’t likely to be any recession during the
year to and June, 1948. Apart from ex-
cise, which increased by halting steps
from Is. 9d. a gallon in 1939 to 4s. 7d.
in 1942, there has been no increase in
the price of beer since 1921.
The Government now takes 14s, 7d,
in the pound of the co.’s gross receipts
from beer. The other ss. sd. has to cover
increased production, distribution and
other costs, including co. tax, as well as
profit, which is taxed again as dividends
in the hands of shareholders.
Increased output and savings resulting
from more economical methods of pro-
duction and distribution have cushioned
the bump from expanding costs, recently
aggravated by introduction of the 40-hour
week —apart from the effect of the time
factor on costs, the shorter week is
equivalent to a 10 p.c. lift in hourly wage-
rates. On the other hand, abolition of
War-time (Co.) Tax will help to offset the
growth in outgoings.
Scarcity of containers hampered the
co.’s sales last term ; wooden casks are
in short supply, and no new bottles have
been made in S. Aus. since December
last. Meanwhile the co. has been using
secondhand bottles, and orders have been
placed for stainless-steel casks, found
successful abroad. After making full
provision for taxation, depreciation, etc.,
and including £2420 dropped from some-
where into reserves, disclosed net earn-
ings were £3OBl short of the previous
year’s at £90,900. That was 12.6 p.c.
on capital as against 13, 12.4, 11.7, 11.3,
11.2, 11.5, 13.1 and 13.5 p.c. back to
1940.

upon cash for £12,959 and increased the
trade debt, which includes an unspecified

Not only has Cox Bros, been one of the
most spectacular post-war buyers of real
estate, but some of its purchases are going
to entail further heavy expense. For in-
stance, the corner building at William-
and Murray-streets, Perth, comprising
about 12 shops, was bought for £130,000
18 months ago with the declared aim of
converting it into a single “modem em-
porium” when the work can be con-
tracted ; a £34,000 property in Bourke-
street, Melbourne, bought about the same
time, will allow extension of Cox Bros.’
existing head office, which adjoins it;
and another modern shop is to rear itself
in Hobart on a site that cost £60,000 last
October. Extra capital for these schemes
will be raised “in instalments as re-
quired”—and, at the present altitude of
building costs, the total amount is likely
to be substantial.
Discussing the purpose behind these
new commitments, chairman A. V.
Walker has emphasised an element of
necessity: “Looking to the future, the co.
finds that it is beset by many difficulties,
which can only be solved by further ex-
pansion, The lower gross-profit margins
and rising expenses make it necessary to
develop a still further increased trade to
maintain profits.” The attitude of price-
control has been less than sympathetic
towards the requirements of retail con-
cerns, like Cox Bros., which strongly fea-
ture time-payment facilities. Gross-profit
margins have never been so fine as now —
“below the pre-war rate of operating ex-
penses”—and the unprecedented turnover
which has alone made trading pro
can’t be expected to keep its post-war
impetus indefinitely. But now tha
referendum verdict has taken some o
immutable aspects from pnce-controls,
the board should be able to develop
plans in a more positive frame of mm
The co.’s 39 stores, distributed over all
States except Queensland, have so tar
specialised in clothing, drapery and fur-
nishings. Its large credit business came
through the 1930 slump comparatively
well, and had grown to record size when
war put a brake on trading. Some of the
funds accumulated during the slack war
years were used to discharge mortgages.
The return of time-payment sales last
term —signalised by a £114,568 rise in
debtor balances —together with a net addi-
tion of £182,448 to fixed assets, led the
board to raise £269,217 again from
secured creditors and to reduce cash by
£69,279:

Debtor balances are entered after an

The liquid position has been relieved since
the close of accounts by an issue of
240,295 ss. ords. at a 3s. 6d. premium,
giving a total increase in funds of
£102,125.
Last year’s gross revenue of £95,468
was £3128 better than in 1946, thanks to
the high turnover. After tax provision of
£36,459 (up £814) and depreciation of
£5370 (up £384), the net figure was £2212
better at £53,664, and represented 11.5
p.c. on mean capital compared with 11
p.c. in 1946.
Despite the chairman’s warnings last
September, turnover has probably been
maintained so far this term. But there is
more capital to feed, some of the new
assets aren’t yet turning in much, and
the board will doubtless be concerned to
strengthen reserves for the building
projects ahead. At 9s. 6d. each, the ss.
ords. yield a shade under 4 p.c. and have
net tangible cover of 6s. lid. each. Both
the A and B prefs. (backing 82s. and 85s.
respectively) are quoted around 31s. each,
yielding 4.5 p.c. on their 7 p.c. cumulative
divs.
The Rise in Tin
After long and steady pressure from
Malayan tin-producing interests, the
British Ministry of Supply lifted the Lon-
don price of tin by £SSO a ton (9.6 p.c.),
making the figure £5569 a ton as from
June 1. There was a corresponding lift
in the price of the metal ex smelters
Singapore and Penang to £5554 a ton,
and, on June 2, the New York figure rose
from 94 cents to 103 cents a pound,
equal to £5572 10s. a ton. The new
London price compares with an average
of £5256 12s. 9d. for 1940, £SIB9 12s. Id.
for 1938 and a between-wars peak of
£S4I9 in 1920. According to London re-
ports U.S. is short of the metal and has a
big stockpiling programme in hand.
Before WOrld War II many Malayan
tin cos. were earning satisfactory profits
with tin at £S2OO a ton. Modern dredges
were then handling as much as 4,000,000
c.y. annually at an average cost of around
3d. a yard. On the average Malayan tin
ore assays about 72 p.c. metallic tin
After deducting transport, smelter charges
and royalty, only about 58 p.c. of the
market price of the metal was realised
by the producing cos. Since the war
there has been a steep rise in operating
and all other costs, which have more than
doubled in most cases and are still on
the up-grade. Also, in addition to a
14 p.c. export tax on the gross proceeds
of tin ore, the Government of the newly-
formed Malayan Union recently imposed

In Australia the fixed selling-
price for tin was lifted by £A3S
to £ASSO per ton on March 1,
because of the higher price of
imported tin. The buying price
for tin concentrates, assaying
70 p.c. or over, is 925. a unit
(£A46O a ton) delivered Sydney.
A 70 p.c. concentrate is thus
worth £A322 per ton. The Aus-
tralian equivalent of the present
London price of £5569 is £A7II
ss. per ton, or approximately
l4os. (Aust.) a unit.

Prices and “Controls”
Successive “Labor” Govern-
ments at Canberra have used
war-time legislation and “con-
trols” to create paper-money
“prosperity,” paper “social secu-
rity,” payroll types of “full-
employment,” a basis of sociali-
sation of finance and industry,
and, it was hoped by Caucus,
permanent power for the
“Labor” party governing from
an all-powerful Canberra.
The Curtin and Chifley Minis-
tries seized upon legislation in-
troduced primarily to fight a
total war in order to perpetuate
a totalitarian form of govern-
ment. War-time powers still in
force (nearly three years after
war in the Pacific ended) have
also been used to disguise or re-
tard the effects of wrong finan-
cial policy and the breakdown of
industrial law and order in the
trade-unions. .
In their Budgets the various
“Labor” Governments created a
great deal of monetary inflation.
Some of this was unavoidable,
but much of it has been the
result of the outlay of credit for
political purposes. The extrava-
gance and waste of the Chifley
outfit have been astonishing.
Money has been flowing out of
the Treasury on a scale unpre-
cedented in the country’s history.
The “savings” of the people,
on paper, have risen to about
two and a half times the pre-
war total. An inflationary pyra-
mid has been built on these
“savings.” That part of Govern-
ment expenditure that was not
provided for by taxation at
“graduated” rates was covered
mostly by credit-creation —
savings-bank money was asked
for by the Treasury where public
subscriptions failed to fill loans,
and Treasury bills were dis-
counted on an extensive scale
with the central bank. The
savings banks as a result
have a huge swag of their de-
posits represented today by Gov-
ernment securities, though de-
positors are legally still entitled
to withdraw their money and
spend it.
Accompanying this gross Gov-
ernment expenditure and conse-
quential creation of paper money
and “credit” by Canberra, the
traditional “Labor” policy in
the industrial field has been put
into practice. As “easy”
methods of creating credit were
employed, so the doctrine of
higher wages and a shorter
working week, with reduced out-
put per man-hour and no incen-
tive permitted for greater effort,
was worked to the limit. More
employment of a mere payroll
form was the concomitant of
“easy” credit; and whilst wages
and “savings” mounted, produc-
tion per man-hour fell. And so
did average living standards.
The pressure under prices has,
of course, been increased in the
ratio that exists between wages
per man-hour and production
per man-hour. It was inevitable
that higher wages and lower
production would bring about
higher costs of production, in-
creased prices and steeper living
costs. With the 40-hour working
week came a 40-hour standard of
living. And the Chifley Govern-
ment, which aimed to revolution-
ise the financial system through
nationalised banking, a credit
system based on “full employ-
ment,” and the subservience of
private enterprise to a Canberra
bureaucracy, failed altogether to
cope with the industrial demoral-
isation and dislocation that some-
how kept on extending as taxa-
tion and inflation became more
gigantic.
The type of finance that has
been practised by the Chifley
Cjovernment, where it is accom-
panied by a failure to bring
production up to much higher
levels per man-hour than previ-
ously existed, can only be con-
tinued, even temporarily,
where a bureaucracy is
fully empowered to exercise
“controls” in a way that will
mask the inflation that is taking
place with its consequent rise in
production and living costs. But
even with full “controls” the
Administration has not done an
efficient job of masking infla-
tion. Any person desiring to
buy a home has found that in
eight cases out of ten a black-
market transaction is necessary,
and that the Treasurer’s ap-
proved figure is a fiction in prac-
tice. Where there is any scarcity
of commodities and services the
blackmarket operates and
under Canberra controls the
“Your ACCIDENT may be comprehensive , but your policy
isn't!"
blackmarket has become a tre-
mendous racket.
Price-control and many other
similar controls were a necessity
during the peculiar conditions
that existed during war-time.
The nation had for a long period
to concentrate on the production
of munitions and to restrict the
output of consumer goods—this
at a time when the amount of
money passing to consumers was
bound to be of record propor-
tions, terrific taxation of some in-
come-earners notwithstanding.
For a limited transition
period, too, price-control was
necessary—until such time as a
diligent people could restore the
peace-time' productive capacity
of industry and set about lifting
output, with the assistance of im-
proved manufacturing tech-
niques, to a far higher per-capita
figure than before the war. But
it was never intended that price-
control should be continued
merely to disguise the failure of
trade-unionism to assume its
post-war responsibilities, or for
a central Government thereby
to further a policy of socialism
as opposed to democratic private
enterprise.
In a humid post-war atmos-
phere that produced strange
economic growths and remark-
able political fungi and para-
sites there has been a failure to
get back to simple, essential
principles. There has to be a
fair day’s work for fair pay
again in this country and a
minimum of experimentation in
the field of politics, with the citi-
zen enjoying the right to spend
his own money in his own way.
If price-control is to be pre-
cipitately abandoned by Can-
berra, as seems likely, then there
should be large reductions in
taxation and all possible stimulus
should be given to private en-
terprise. Health and strength
must be restored to enterprise,
and half-baked schemes of
socialisation should be forgotten.
Uneasy “Prosperity’
The wool cheque for the cur-
rent year promises to be a
record one bringing in a
revenue at least double that of
the record war-time cheques
—and our wheat harvest
will yield the highest monetary
return ever. Metals are at steep
figures, excepting lead and spelter
sold on the home market: Any
woollen textiles we have for ex-
port find a ready market over-
seas, our chemicals are in de-
mand at home and abroad, and
tallow, rabbitskins and the like
have swollen in economic im-
portance. Higher prices are be-
ing received for dairy produce,
too.
Unquestionably a great money
income will come to Australia
this year. But the final half of
1947-48 brought to us the 40-
hour week, and with it a further
reduction in output per man-
hour. Not only does this mean
lower production for home con-
sumption and export; it also
brings to industry higher costs
of production, and to the com-
munity a higher cost of living.
Strikes in key industries and
the deliberate keeping-down of
coal production have added to
the difficulty of maintaining pro-
duction, and at the same time
distribution has been slowed
down by Communist policy in
the land- and sea-transport in-
dustries.
Our high external income thus
is not all it seems. We are los-
ing the advantages that should
be coming to us from this higher
external revenue by inflating our
internal costs and reducing our
exportable surplus. The trouble
is that while we continue to bask
in the sun of high overseas prices
there is no impelling force to
make us prepare for the chill
wind of lower prices that may
come when production from the
world’s agricultural industries
rises to above the level set by
world demand. And we are cer-
tainly not going about the job
at home of bringing production
of goods and services in general
up to a point where the value
of our money will remain stable
—in other words, retain its pur-
chasing-power.
The Canberra “Labor” Gov-
ernment, with great restrictive
powers over private enterprise,
has been preoccupied with a
policy of Socialism: this policy
has led to the creation of paper-
money “prosperity” and to a
slump in output per man-hour,
the Communist party co-operat-
ing to the full in the latter
calamity. We will have to get
back to the basic realisms of
production and trade as we knew
them in 1939, even if we have
learned a good deal more about
finance and employment-control
over the past nine years. At
present we are wasting time,
manpower and material re-
sources by experimenting in im-
practical politics and tolerating
intimidation on all sides by a
treacherous Communist organi-
sation which the Prime Minister
protests is merely propagating a
“philosophy.”

LIBO-6540
Maoriland’s Free Medicine
Business and robbery are
mixed up together in New Zea-
land’s “free” drug and medicine
scheme, which must be the
greatest racket carried on among
nearly two million of a popula-
tion anywhere in the world.
Business is on the box-seat as
drug manufacturers, chemists,
wholesalers and retailers do a
roaring trade in dope at profits
that make most other traders’
mouths water ; and there are no
bad debts, because the State pays
the piper. There’s legalised rob-
bery as the State takes millions
out of wages and salaries, which
the earners never see, as the
money is collared at the source.
It began back in 1940, with a
diminutive £20,000 annexed for
medical “benefits,” which lulled
Maorilanders with visions of an
Elysian highway to health.
Three years later outlay was
bordering on £2,000,000, and
in six years touched £5,306,000.
Now it’s somewhere above
£7,000,000, or nearly £4 a head
for every man, woman and child ;
and is rising rapidly.
This, in a nutshell, is the record
of “free” medicine and medical
service in New Zealand in
eight years. At last some Maori-
landers are beginning to wake up
to the scandal; but drug-drink-
ing won’t be halted easily. Five
years ago doctors signed
3,500,000 prescriptions at 3s.
3d. average cost. In the
year ended March, 1947, the
total touched 5,882,000, at
4s B£d. a time. Expensive new
drugs brought in lifted the aver-
age, and, as they are “free,” the
public is going for them. Some
doctors say they’re worried
about the “tastes” of patients,
but can’t stop the drug habit.
Minister of Health Mabel
Howard is worried, too. Only
the rank and file, business and
doctors with get-rich-quick in-
stincts seem satisfied.
Thousands of prescriptions in-
clude dangerous habit-forming
concoctions. Doctors admit
cases where patients take five
aspirins every morning as a
normal course. Hypnotic drugs
of the barbiturate group, basis
of most sleeping tablets, have
taken deep hold. More and
more cough mixtures contain
heroin, a sedative drug. Who
will stop this? Doctors point
to warnings they gave before the
scheme got going. The Govern-
ment is politically committed up
to its neck. It’s a tougher pro-
position than breaking the spiral
of prices and wages. Australia’s

Another Petrol “Drive”
Several weeks having elapsed
since the last one, there’s now
another grand “drive” to save
petrol, with the usual blather
about “campaign plans” and
“licence inspections” and so
forth, and among other things
thousands of motor-owners are
to receive forms which will de-
mand answers to the following:
How is the vehicle used in your
business or profession and what is
the normal area of operation?
Monthly mileage?
If you carry goods, state nature of
goods.
Do you get ration tickets from any
source other than the Fuel Board?
What gallonage do you consider
necessary for your essential monthly
requirements?
Where is the vehicle garaged?
If not garaged at or near business
address, why?
Being an easygoing crowd,
inured by now to the creeping
tentacles of the bureaucrat, the
recipients will not set a day upon
which to publicly burn the
forms, but will fill them in as
best they can and return them.
How this is to effect an im-
mediate saving in petrol con-
sumption is a mystery, since it
will take months for the officials
to collect the forms and tabulate
and analyse them —if they ever
do —and everybody who is cut
will want to lodge an appeal
about it.
Meantime, if they feel like
it, motorists can reflect on the
Evatt “Foreign Policy.” It
favored the Indonesians against
the Dutch and allowed the
wharfies to ban Dutch ships for
two years, thereby throwing
N.E.I. petrol away; it favored
partition in Palestine and is
looking approvingly on Israel,
which the Arabs! are violently
opposing, and jeopardising the
flow of petrol from Arabian
fields. The Haifa refinery has
stopped working.
Meantime thfe Fuel Board per-
sists in limiting the currency of
petrol-tickets to one or two
months, with the result that
ticket-holders either fill their
own or somebody else’s tanks
and drums with petrol that
they don’t really want.
Under a continuous-currency
ticket system, the stuff would
probably be available for some-
body who did want it. In petrol-
rationing, as in pretty well every-
thing else, the crowd at Can-
berra are hopeless and expensive
blunderers.
Half of New Zealand’s grow-
ing crockery and pottery output
is now going abroad, mainly to
Australia, as Maoriland firms
get into their production stride.
The largest pottery, in Auck-
land, owned by Consolidated
Brick and Pipe Co. Ltd., is
today turning out 300,000 pieces
a month and isn’t worried about
Saturation of the local market
in main utility lines while orders
pour in from abroad. There’s
no bottleneck in materials; for
95 per cent, of the industry’s
needs are found locally. Chair-
man Tom Clark, of Consolidated
Brick, said last August that
banked-up demands from Aus-
tralian firms were enough to keep
the co.’s factory going all-out
for at least 12 months, but only
a quarter of the output was
then being shipped. Now ex-
ports are, roughly, double the
1947 rate. Experts from over-
seas have helped the industry
get past the awkward stage.

Profits of J. R. McKenzie,
Ltd., and Subsidiaries, leading
rivals of Woolworths in New
Zealand, are climbing back to-
wards pre-war levels, and a
bonus of 2\ p.c. added to the 10
p.c. div. gives shareholders the
best return since 14 p.c. was
handed out in 1940. From
£64,821 a year ago, earnings
have jumped to £78,157 (year
ended March). Bottom was
touched at £46,345 in 1943, and
there were two more years, 1945
and 1946, when the return
from trading fell short of the
sum needed to cover the £50,000
div. handout of the holding co.,
McKenzie’s Department Stores,
Ltd. Peak profits were £89,052
in 1941, and peak div. was 18
p.c. in 1938. It’s 12 years since
the concern was organised on the
present double-story basis, after
25 years as a private co. About
20 years ago there was a switch-
over from fancy-goods to depart-
mental stores to stave off the
Woolworth challenge, and profits
mounted. Since 1940, like most
other N.Z. cos., it has had a
struggle to keep stocks up, but
there’s a big rise lately to more
than three-quarters of a million,
against £496,100 last year.

As zero hour, June 30,
looms up for getting on the right
side of the fence to share in the
Geneva tariff cuts, Maorilanders
are growing uneasy about the
silence of their Government. If
Fraser, Nash and Co, intend to
do anything about the pact
they’ll have to act immediately
Parliament meets in June; but
do they intend to act?
Memories of the fate of
Bretton Woods, which New
Zealand signed but didn’t ratify,
don’t raise hopes. John Bull,
Australia, Canada, U.S., Benelux
and France have thrown in their
lot together for lower tariffs —
though it’s not clear how far
Empire preference will be
knocked by the new moves —but
Maoriland (the world’s leading
per-capita trader) looks like
being left out in the cold. With
nearly all its eggs in one basket
perhaps it doesn’t think world
pacts matter.

SUNDRY SHOWS
"Country Boy."
I have always been inclined
to forgive Donald Friend his
slums for the sake of his humor.
Not that his particular brand of
pictorial fun ever specially
charmed or delighted me, but
humor itself seems desirable and
worthy of recommendation to
all painters of slums, using the
term, of course, in its general
sense —Friend, like Drysdale, can
produce a slum in a paddock.
Friend’s exhibition at Sydney’s
Macquarie Galleries, however,
indicates that altogether too
much had been made of his
humor, and that what might
otherwise be regarded as an in-
dividual and pleasant foible is
becoming an end in itself.
A possibly unsuspected source
of the pleasure felt at Friend’s
clowning in paint is simply the
power of contrast. Slum-paint-
ing is, by and large, cheerless and
slightly inhuman. Humor is
human and may be humanising.
In the bulk of slum-painting
politics are mixed with paint and
humans are degraded to slum-
dwellers to the neglect of char-
acter and with a sort of abso-
lute shrugging away from
beauty.
Friend is guilty of that sort of
distortion. At the Macquarie
Galleries he has, with woolly
abstractions, barren rocks and
unreal human figures; erosion
and puppets. But the puppets,
at least, have a sort of life; a
bounding and ridiculous energy.
And in one pen-drawing,
“Country Boy,” he has captured
something of the elusive poetry
of youth, balanced by its inco-
herence and awkwardness.
At a country school which I
attended we studied, among
other things, Conrad’s Yputh
and Caspar Ruiz, and one boy
delighted his contemporaries by
drawing Caspar a South
American peasant giant who was
imprisoned, who married a
beautiful woman who made him
an instrument of revenge, and
who finally perished by his own
strength—in prison, shaggy head
protruding from the bars and
tongue hanging out like a pant-
ing dog’s, while a sombrero’d
sentry swilled wine. This
masterpiece was executed on the
inside cover of the book and
entitled “Caspar the Gasper.”
It delighted the adolescent
students of literature, and many
copies were made. No dis-
respect was intended to Conrad’s
powerful dramatisation of char-
acter and beautiful and illumi-
nating prose. It was, indeed,
the vividness of that writing that
had stamped the character on
our minds at all, giving the
drawing wit and point. Conrad,
by the quality of his genius, had
modified our proper adolescent
obsessions to the extent that we
could enjoy a literary joke. But
the joke itself and our reactions
were adolescent.
There is, I think, a similar
adolescence about Friend’s
painted humor, and in the enjoy-
ment of it. ,No. 8 at the Mac-
quarie Galleries show, “Town
With One Horse,” shows a
straggling bit of town and one
horse. It is funny, but not in
itself proof of great and original
talent. And, besides the jokes,
there is a kind of naive crudity
in “Myself when young did
eagerly frequent ” extending
from its literary connotation to
the painting and the pose be-
neath it.
“Country Boy” is different.
It is the charm of adolescence
observed and captured in
maturity. This, another pen-
drawing, “Georgia Lee,” and
“Casuarinas” were bought by
the N.S.W. Gallery. The oil “St.
Patrick’s Night, Wattle Flat,” is
one of Friend’s wild and woolly
paintings, full of violence and
unreality. The gouache “Idols
in the Jungle” belongs to the
woolly abstractions.
In another “Country Boy” at
the exhibition —a copy, in oils —
the features are repeated and
everything else is lost. This is
not conclusive evidence of the
artist’s deficiencies —many a
sketch achieves the life and fire
which may be searched for in
vain in a full-scale painting—•
but it is, at least, an indication
of the difficulties Friend will
have to overcome before he at-
tains, in artistic achievement, a
fraction of the reputation wished
upon him by friendly critics.
J. F.
Pointing and Sculpture.
Looking over the walls of
David Jones’ Gallery, at the
paintings of Ruth Pascoe, Renee
Rainer, George Rainer and
Phillip Shepherd, one is struck
by what is called “a common
aesthetic standard in feeling for
color and design” ; if, indeed,
one is struck by anything but a
sense of ordered futility, puffed
a little with hard colors.
Much depends, of course, on
the viewpoint. If one is con-
vinced, for instance, that a kind
of rigid streamlining of nature
is the proper, beautiful and in-
evitable method of interpreta-
tion, one will judge all the work
kindly as indicating, perhaps,
original viewpoints. Design—■
with qualifications—can be
admitted. But one would need
to lean over backwards in order
to ignore the yellow blare and
harsh outlines of Ruth Pascoe’s
“Autumn Willows.” George
Rainer’s impressionistic “Morn-
ing oh the Parramatta” has more
confetti than light, and Ruth
Pascoe’s “Tumut Landscape”
does scant justice to the soft
beauties of that countryside.
The drawings, perhaps, are
better in that they show more
individuality.
Some of the criticisms of the
landscapes apply also to the
i
nudes. There is a certain bronze
vigor and individuality about
Ruth Pascoe’s nudes, but they
are curiously hard and sexless ;
unsoftened and unwarmed by
life. George Rainer’s pastel
“Nude” is vaguely ugly, his “Re-
clining Nude” is stiff and chalky
and Renee Rainer’s pastel “Re-
clining Nude” has life but little
beauty. Sculpture by Bruno
Simon has, by the nature of the
medium, escaped the flattening
influence of many of the paint-
ings without attaining individual
vitality. Besides nudes and
landscapes there are slums.
These are poor of their type, and
heavily influenced by Drysdale,
Sali Herman and others.
In any frankly disappointing
exhibition one tries to discover
something which justifies the ex-
penditure of artistic energy and
undeniable craftsmanship. In
this case it may be said that Ruth
Pascoe’§ nudes have a certain
brazen vigor, that there is a
kind of straying delicacy in
much of Renee Rainer’s> work,
that George Rainer’s “Mac-
quarie-street Landscape” shows
a genuine but moderate feeling
for old buildings, and that Ruth
Pascoe’s “River Near Mudgee,”
in a rough and vigorous way,
does convey something.
Melbourne Art.
Art shows in Melbourne are
coming out like orchids and are
just as varied. Violet Mclnnes’s
popular still-lifes have turned the
Athenaeum into a horticultural
exhibition. Her ranunculi,
camellias, magnolia stellata, jap-
onica and fuchsias are factual
rather than atmospheric. A bowl
of old-fashioned roses is an ex-
ception, '
At George’s, Sali Herman is
showing enough old bricks
to solve the housing shortage.
Russell Drysdale’s influence
shows in pictures like “The
Drovers,” in his red-brick ruins,
slum tenements and depressing
rural landscapes. “Native Vil-
lage in the Moonlight” is a study
in forced contrasts ; and there is
an almost brutal emphasis about
“Park Gate, Parramatta.”
A show of the watercolors
and etchings of L. F. Reynolds
at Kozminsky’s will come as a
surprise to the large public
which only knew him as the
creator of the immortal Mr.
Melbourne. As a serious artist
be followed the school of English
watercolor paintings, though his
subject-matter is the picturesque
old architecture of Victoria and
the Apple Island.
As facile exercises in a con-
vention Reynolds’s pictures are
in a different category from those
of Dorothy Whitehead in the
Lower Gallery adjacent. Miss
Whitehead endeavors to record
her observation of Nature with-
out recourse to a formula, and
in “A Calm Day,” “The Green
Valley,” “The Old Pear Tree”
and “Road Shadows” she gets
close to her objective.
Moiseiwitsch.
It is 40 years since Moisei-
witsch made his debut as a
youth in London, and 11 years
since he played to Sydney. There
is a little more grey in his still
full head of hair and his art has
mellowed; he has become a
philosopher of the keyboard.
That was immediately apparent
in his handling of Bach’s Chro-
matic Fantasy and Fugue —the
“lingerising” in the Fantasy was
effortless, even detached, per-
fection ; the building-up of the
polytonal effects in the Fugue
in an atmosphere of calm medi-
tation completely captured the
ageless charm of this 230-year-
old work.
In the Introduction to the
Adagio in the Beethoven
Waldstein Sonata the notes
were caressed rather than
played; the Rondo, from a
slow trickle, became a steady
stream of purest melody. A
Chopin group was poetry in
sound; and the Polonaise in
A Flat ended in a shattering
climax of tremendous, power.
The difficulties in Brahms’s
“Paganini Variations” were
brushed aside as if they didn’t
exist.
The second concert produced
Liszt’s great Sonata in B
Minor, and Moiseiwitsch is one
of only half a dozen pianists
who can give this wonderful
work its absolute With
complete authority he went from
phases in which notes were
barely heard to great masses of
tone gathered with tremendous
impulses. Under his hands the
delicacies of Debussy became
veritable filigrees in music. An-
other Chopin group contrasted
magically, with the splendid
sonorities he conjured from
Liszt’s showy and brilliant
Second Hungarian Rhapsody.

Hephzibah Menuhin gave a
flawless recital at the Melbourne
Town Hall last week in a
majestic programme which in-
cluded Schumann’s enormous
Fantasie in C Major, Schubert’s
Thirty-six Dances, Ernest
Bloch’s Sonata for Piano —the
first public performance in Aus-
tralia —and Beethoven’s complex
Sonata Op. 110.


Women's Letters
From Melbourne
At a cocktail party in the Marina-room
of the Australia Sir Robert Knox, chair-
man of the Victorian Division of the Red
Cross, gave to his press and radio guests
details of the next Miss Australia contest,
which hp hopes will be another good
moneyspinner for the cause of mercy.
Margaret Saker has been appointed State
organiser, with Kathryn Hiskens as her
aide; Gwen Coleman is in charge of
office affairs, Louise Reid of pub-
licity. There are four country organisers
already on the job, and they are appar-
ently well on it —Joan Baker, of Geelong,
is the first candidate for Miss Victoria.
All the other States are joining the Quest,
and the chosen Miss Australia will enter
the Miss British Empire Quest against
competitors from Canada, South Africa,
New Zealand and Great Britain.
The concert at which Australian
’cellist Lauri Kennedy played Bloch’s
“Schelomo” and thereby added both dis-
tinction and contrast to a programme
which included Schubert’s “Unfinished”
and the Elgar Variations brought to the
Town Hall a host of music-lovers. Mrs.
lan Potter added to her royal-blue silver-
threaded taffeta snood a trim black-wool
jacket-suit. Edna Glasscock put a touch
of gaiety to her brown outfit with a hat
of pink-and-green taffeta ribbon. Mavis
Hotmer’s velvet gown was patterned in
bright golden poppies and green leaves.
Mrs. Sydney Myer wore a hip-length fur
coat over her short black frock. Bright
pink taffeta formed the necessary splash
of color for the black hat which Mrs.
E. Beecham wore with her black Indian-
lamb coat. Mrs. P. Alston’s black coat
had lapels of Persian-lamb. Black fox
formed the collar of Mrs. George
Mitchell’s coat. Lynette Young’s
Persian-lamb-trimmed coat was worn
with a black-velvet hat.
English comedian Tommy Trinder this
week airmailed his acceptance of an in-
vitation from the Victorian Division of
Red Cross to appear in a short film de-
picting the appreciation of the people of
Britain of the part played by the society
in the recent Food for Britain and Flood
Victims Appeals. It is hoped that the
film, which will show how and to whom
the gifts are distributed, will be
completed in time for screening during
the Red Cross Appeals Week, which
begins on September 1.
Emphasis was on coats at the Williams-
town R.C.’s meeting at Moonee Valley,
for the chill wind bit deep. The long
coat with the flared back and snug-fitting
hood was popular; the form-fitting
tailored coat with rows of buttons for
trimming was another winner, and a new
trend was noticed in the tailored coat
with its shoulder cape. Mrs. A. L.
Walters’s bright-scarlet coat was double-
breasted and worn with a small black
side-tilted hat trimmed with black coq
feathers. The small brown felt hat which
Mrs. Ray Josephs wore with a full-length
water-mole coat featured sweeping burnt-
orange-toned ospreys. Mrs. John Kauf-
man had the same tones in ribbon as
trimming for her small brown hat. Mrs.
Harry Reid added dyed-ermine to her
American Beauty wool frock and small
black-velvet coq-feathers-trimmed hat.
Ivy Parker combined black and burnt-
orange to add distinction to the large hat
which topped her black ensemble.
An unusual beech-brown wool jacket-
suit was chosen by Mrs. L. P. Coleman,
Forming the lapels of the jacket were
kolinsky-fur skins which fell softly to
the waist; her hat was of leaf-green felt
irimmed with coq feathers. Lillian Wight-
man’s three-quarter-length Persian-lamb
coat was worn with black frock and rust-
wool turban, which had a side drape
fringed in black. Mrs. R. G. Lee, from
Adelaide, matched her wine-toned wool
tailored coat with a quilled velvet hat.
Mrs. B. E. Wurm, also from that city,
combined in neat array petunia-toned
wool coat, beige fox furs and a small hat
carrying blue and cyclamen ribbons, Mrs.
John McGrath’s beige wool jacket-suit
had bands of beige fox edging the elbow-
length sleeves; her small brown hat was
trimmed with velvet ribbon in the same
tonings. Mrs. Charles Davis covered her
ginger-brown wool frock with a match-
ing three-quarter-length swing-back coat;
her felt hat in the same tonings was
trimmed with a pheasant feather.
Making one of her rare appearances,
Hephzibah Menuhin gave a recital in the
Town Hall to assist Jewish Relief Funds.
She looked sprite-like in a bouffant white
marquisette gown which featured a heart-
shaped neckline and a skirt made in-
teresting with widely-spaced bands of
self-niching. A distinguished audience
included the Lieut.-Governor, Sir Edmund
Herring, and Lady Herring, the latter in
a gown and matching jacket of marine-
blue and silver lame; and the Premier
and Mrs. Hpllway, she in powder-blue
lame and fur wrap in which was pinned
a presentation posy of daphne from Lady
Olivier, Mrs. Tom Mitchell, in powder-
blue taffeta gown and silver musquash
bolero, was accompanied by Mesdames
Bryce Smith, E. E. Fyffe and Ray Fox.
Mrs. George Bassant, smart in black and
antique silver jewellery, brought daughter
Rosemary, whose pastel-pink chiffons
were worn under a white-beaver coat.
Mrs. Byron Cuming, whose property at
Camperdown adjoins that of Hephzibah’s
husband, Lindsay Nicholas, came down
for the concert; she was with Mrs. E. R.
Stewart, of Frankston. Mrs. T, Allan
Mackay’s gown of soft-mist-blue crepe
had the bodice patterned with cyclamen
sequins. Anne Mclntyre’s brown-fox
bolero was worn with a pastel-green
crepe gown. With Lady Knox were her
son and daughter-in-law. Mrs. Arnold
Isaacson, whose choice was beech-brown
velvet, was accompanied by Mrs. M.
Beck, an English visitor, who wore a
garnet-red dinner-gown under her fur
coat. Mrs. M. Horne, who was accom-
panied by daughter Jane, wore a silver-
lynx fur jacket over her black gown.
Mrs. J. Chester Guest, of Toorak, one
of the city’s most charming hostesses,
is a keen worker for the Fitzroy Free
Kindergarten and is also one of the ticket
secretaries for the Celebrity concert at
which Eileen Joyce will be soloist with
the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, at
the Town Hall on June 26.
At this concert, which will be under
the baton of Bernard Heinze, Eileen
Joyce will play concertos by Grieg,
Beethoven and Tschaikowsky. Mesdames
Edmund Alcock and William- Seymour
have chosen the red and white of Royal
Melbourne Hospital for the color-scheme
of the decorations. The hospital crest in
these colors will decorate the three bal-
conies and in the foyer red poinsettias and
pokers will add their brilliant colors. Mrs.
Jim Fitzgerald, who is in charge of the
programmes, will be assisted by nine
nurses from the Royal Melbourne hos-
pital.
R. G. Menzies adopted a new r6le
when he appeared as one of the god-
fathers at the christening of Rupert
Neville Arthur, infant son of John
Howse, M.H.R., and Mrs. Howse. Cere-
mony .was held at St. John’s Church,
Toorak. Everard Baillieu, the other god-
father, is in England. The godmothers
are Mrs. Dudley Brunton, sister of Mr.
Howse, and Mrs. Jim Campbell, sister
of Mrs. Howse. Baby wore a very lovely
christening-robe of lace over satin, with
a satin carrying-coat—they were lent by
Mrs. Brunton. Among the close rela-
tives who were later entertained at the
home of the baby’s maternal grand-
mother, Mrs. Rupert Downes, of Malvern,
were the baby’s great-grandmother, Mrs.
Arthur Robb, and his paternal grand-
mother, Lady Howse.
Guest-of-honor at the International
Club’s luncheon-party was Mrs. W. R.
McMillan, former hon. organising secre-
tary and one of the founders of the club
in this city, whose home is now in Adel-
aide. Mrs. Herbert Brookes, president of
the club, welcomed Mrs. McMillan, who
is holidaying here. Noted among the
many who forgathered to meet their
former confrere were Mesdames G. H.
Hargrave (now organising secretary),
King-Mouy, George Swinburne, E. S. A.
Bell, L. J. Sigalis, F. W. Shepherd and
H, V. Mattingley and Madame
Tarczynska.
From Sydney
The Girl in the Flat Opposite felt she
had committed a faux pas in going out
to the sheep show in a sheepskin coat.
Those aristocrats the Border Leicesters
gave her one distasteful glance over the
high bridge of their Romany*noses, and
she hurriedly departed to the Ryelands,
who took no notice of her at all, while
the Dorset Horns, secure in the knowledge
of the unruffled set of their permanent-
waves, gave a cold stare that she felt to
be, in the phraseology of the day,
“hostile.” However, one Dorset Horn
seemed to be recovering from a good
time. He lay just inside his pen, letting
the world go by, one great horn carelessly
draped outside the middle bar.
Photographers were as busy as at a
beauty contest. And, anyway, this sheep
show is a kind of Miss N.S.W. quest.
Blue and red and gold ribbons caught
the June sunlight coming into the
pavilions in pale shafts. Up and down
the lines of patient Romney Marshes
walked judge J. G. Donald (his sweater
a rich blue), all the way from Feather-
ston (Maoriland). Keeping an eye on
this class were Mrs. R. J. Johnston, from
Tumbarumba, with small daughter Helen,
and Mrs. Basil Wilson, of Tenandra Park,
Gundagai. Mrs. Basil Wilson feels sym-
pathy for sheep: “They are always be-
ing harrassed,” she remarked. Mrs.
Fetherstonehaugh was watching awards
among the Border Leicesters, and Mar-
garet Squires, of Bumbaldry, Cowra, took
active interest in her father’s exhibits.
Knight Fred McMaster, Otway Falk-
iner and Mrs. Bruce Steer, Mrs. W. J.
Campbell, of Walgett, Mrs. Ernest
Griffith, of Narrandera, Mrs. Noel
Freebairn and Mrs. W. O’Neill, of Cowra,
the Anthony Hordern Jun. couple were
early visitors. The Merino held royal
levee all through the show, and parked
close by was the Australian Wool Board’s
caravan display “Wool on Wheels.”
All the furnishings are of woollen weave
—even to the cream and burgundy cur-
tains. And if you wanted to know the
type of blanket the N.S.W. Government
sent to Princess Elizabeth for a wedding
present, a sample of the daffodil softness
was on view.
Ann Price-Jones, only daughter of Mrs.
Melanie Price-Jones, and Laurence Le
Guay have just announced their engage-
ment. Ann is a granddaughter of the
late Reggie Laidley. Laurence was
official photographer to the recent
Antarctic expedition in the Wyatt Earp.
Like all the other newly-engageds they
will be married as soon as they can find
a home to live in. Falk photograph.
Chandeliers were all lit at Romano’s last
Saturday night. Occasion, the Wool Ball
for the benefit of the Peter Pan Kinder-
garten. Tables were booked out weeks
ago, and when 300 or more dancers got
pacing and wriggling around the floor
you couldn’t tell whether a girl had red-
silk stockings and green perfume or the
other way around. A very smart com-
mittee led by Mrs. Reg Moses with Mrs.
Marcel Dekyvere as first-flight organiser
had run this Sheep Show Week attraction,
and the result was a clothes parade to
which Paris might give the accolade.
Anyway, no women in the world (though
the girls of pre-war Milan ran very close)
wear their clothes with a better air than
the women of this country.
Out of compliment to the gentleman
who pays Australia’s rent, there were
prizes offered for the most attractive wool
evening-frocks. First-prize went to an
alluring model which wedded fine dove-
grey wool material and grey Italian
brocade. The brocade was caught into
a bustle effect with two sprays of greeny
flowers. Mrs. Ralph Thompson wore the
frock with charm and was presented with
the prize by Mrs. Charles Lloyd Jones: a
dress-length of fine pale-blue wool chosen
by Norman Hartnell. The Charlie Lloyd
Jones couple had given the prizes, and
had come down from Summerlees, their
Sutton Forest home, to pass judgment.
Mrs. C. L. herself, graceful in black,
arrived cheered by platina-fox, which is
not only warmth-giving, but very hand-
some and rare.
Good-looking Sheelagh Cassidy got off
with the second-prize, a Jacqmar scarf.
Her full-skirted frock of finest beige
woollen had a low-cut neckline and a
draped bodice. A hibiscus-red wool frock
with the new low neckline was worn by
sparkling Mrs. Marcel Dekyvere. Mrs.
Philip Keane’s frock, worn with a white-
ermine jacket, was of rich moire, deli-
cately pink. Mrs. Alexis Albert achieved
a real old-miniature effect in her frock
of rich black silk, her very full skirt
finished with a deep band of white lace.
Among the many country visitors none
was more radiant than Mrs. Horton-
Browne from Young. Her frock was as
green as the grass of the Four Green
Fields (Ireland to you). It had a touch
of gold, and Brian Boru would have been
proud to partner it. President Mrs. Reg
Moses was graceful dignity in soft black
woollen with pearls. Mrs. Lindsay Bell,
who collected the tickets, was a pleasant
prologue to the night. Her black frock
had touches of ivory.
It wasn’t the six-o’clock rush that
brought the crowds to the pavement out-
side the Queen’s Club last Thursday
evening. It was the first cocktail party
the club has given in many years. This
was almost an historic event, and
hundreds of guests stormed, but in very
decorous fashion, Sydney’s conservative
old-established women’s club. The Girl
in the Flat Opposite declares it took from
a quarter to six till twenty past to get
inside the doors and up into the lounge,
where her friends were waiting. Clothes
were fashionable, furs super and hats
sometimes fulsome with flower and
feather. This was a party in the grand
manner. But not one lady present forgot
for an instant that the eye of Victoria
the Good kept watch and ward from
her grandstand position in adjacent
Queen’s-square.
The music of Benno Moiseiwitsch is
always exciting. There’s no ignoring this
music or letting it slide past you, even
if you are not a music-maker yourself.
The vast tone, the irresistible sweep
spread enchantment over a crowded
Town Hall last week —Benno’s lis-
teners only waking from the spell to
applaud. One thing last Wednesday
night’s audience proved, and that is the
musician is no longer dependent on
Sydney’s social layer for his own crust.
The Moiseiwitsch listeners were the girls
and the boys, the men and the women
who know their composers.
Conservatorium director Eugene Goos-
sens came with a group of friends; the
Frank Taits- and the Arthur Taits were
well seated. Under her silver-fox cape
Mrs. Arthur Tait wore a frock of black-
and-white. The skirt long and black,
the white bodice embroidered in sequins.
Mrs. Harald Bowden had for neighbor
singer Strella Wilson. Both were furred
to the chin. From Manly came Mrs.
Harry Twigdert. Pianist Beatrice Tange
was entirely wrapped in grey squirrel. A
pretty girl was blonde Ann Price-
Tones. Ann was in primrose-greens
and -yellows. The waist-length jacket of
her frock was of yellow corduroy, the full
ankle-length skirt of the green. Moisei-
witsch finished off his first recital with
a Saint-Saens etude for left hand. “Just
as well,” remarked a friend after the con-
cert, watching the hordes of autograph-
hunters presenting programmes, records,
sheets of music with lightning-like rapidity
for the artist’s signature. Of a musician
friend who waited to congratulate him,
Benno asked: “Well, is there some hope
for me?”
There’s quite a group of American ex-
servicemen in Sydney. They are settling
down right in our midst, and naturally
they have formed themselves into a club.
They call it the American-Australasian
Ex-Servicemen’s Memorial Club. To
raise funds towards making the rooms
cheery and homely, a committee headed
by the Henry Braddon lady held a dinner
dance at the Pickwick Club last Wednes-
day night. This was a friendly, informal
affair that commenced at 6.30 and ended
at 10.30. There were 300 dancers, and
the president of the club. Colonel George
Noe, could notch up a success. The
Braddon lady’s frock was cut on long
and graceful lines and was of flower-"
printed silk. Vice-president of,the com-
mittee Lorna Salisbury wore an effective
ballerina frock of black taffeta.
Reverend Alan Tory has changed the
title of his play, which he had thought of
calling “Easter Journey,” to “Festival for
Simon.” It is a drama around Simon the
Cyrenean. The dialogue is modern, and
Eugene Goossens has written music for
a chorus of commentators. Mina Shelley
produces the play next Saturday in St.
James’s Hall. Edgar Yardley will play
the part of Simon.
Cocktails at Knellerpore, the home of
Mrs. Nigel Smith, rounded off the races
with a pleasant zip. Glorious flowers
from the gardens decorated the rooms.
Norah Firth and Mrs. Archie Ranken
helped in the entertaining. Red Cross
headquarters’ auxiliary benefits.

THE SERVICE MAN
Palestine's Strange
Armistice.
“Ek Dum”: U.N.O.’s efforts
in Palestine to June 7 had
achieved about the ordinary
measure of success. A cease-fire
having been ordered for June 2,
observers the next day were
doubtful whether it would be-
come effective for the whole of
the month of Sabbatical calm
prescribed. Events quickly
showed how right they were.
The Jews professed to have
ordered cease-fire at 3 a.m. on
Wednesday in accordance with
the U.N.O. instruction and to
have been outraged that the
Arabs insisted on going on
fighting after that hour. It was
then explained that the time set
was not for the ending of actual
fighting but for the reception of
answers from both combatants.
Meanwhile the Irakis an-
nounced that the cease-fire had
been in operation on the north-
ern front since midnight on
Tuesday and that the Syrians
had cancelled a large-scale ad-
vance. But almost at the same
moment, in Damascus, the Syr-
ian Foreign Minister declared
that Syria would not accept any
cease-fire orders unless U.N.O.
and the Jews agreed to the can-
cellation of Palestine partition
and the abolition of the new
Jewish State of Israel.
Arguments in U.N.O.
The Security Council then
shouted that the agreements of
both parties to its armistice had
been unponditional and the
Jewish and Arab representatives
on the Council launched an
argument centring round the
question of whether Israel
should be strangled in its
cradle. Meanwhile Uncle Sam
set about dragooning Britain
and China and other countries
which refuse to govern their
policies by the fact that there
is an election in progress in
the United States, in which the
Jewish vote is highly important,
by wielding the big stick in the
shape of the Marshall Plan. With
Britain it so far has only resulted
in the thinking Americans com-
ing to see the logic of the British
viewpoint. It would be hard
indeed to prove the Arabs —an
indigenous majority in Palestine
who are not in favor of parti-
tion, or, indeed, of the wholesale
immigration of Jews —to be
aggressors in seeking to impose
their policy as a majority on a
very-recently-arrived and hos-
tile foreign minprity. The trial
of the Arab majority on that
count would, before a fair tri-
bunal, undoubtedly result in a
verdict of not guilty, and the
Arab countries could scarcely be
blamed for resenting the intru-
sion into their heart of an ele-
ment which is obviously opening
the door to Russian infiltration
and Communism.
General Spears’s View
Already Britain has sacrificed
a great deal in her muddling
interference in the matter. The
results of that policy were well
summed up in the “Times” on
May 20 by Major-General E. L.
Spears, First Minister to the
Republic of Syria and Lebanon,
1942-44, and husband of Mary
Borden, the American novelist,
when he wrote; —•
We are hated try those Jews we
made such sacrifices to help. We
have forfeited the respect and friend-
ship of the majority of the Arab
peoples and endangered those very
bases the security of which, Mr.
Amery assures us, was one of the
objects of the sponsors of the Jewish
home. These bases, because we
brought the Jews into the Holy Land,
may well be lost to us not only in
Palestine but from the Mediterranean
to the Persian Gulf. This policy has
also led to our oil supplies, without
which we cannot live, being curtailed
and perhaps jeopardised.
The General declares that
“Zionism is proving a fearful
calamity for mankind” and that
it has opened the door to Rus-
sian penetration in the Middle
East which may result in irre-
trievable disaster: to Western
civilisation. Russia is favoring
the Jews, he says, for a simple
reason —“that it is the best way
of disrupting the Middle East.”
Count Bernadotte has been
working hard for the armistice,
but the situation is not helped
by the announcement of Mr.
Ben Gurion, the Israelite
Premier, who declared that his
army had seized joint British-
Arab plans for the capture of
Haifa, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv,
and that the Jewish offensive
would “not be limited to the
frontiers of Israel or even of
Palestine.”
Fighting Goes On
Having heard Security Coun-
cil orders, both sides went on
fighting with renewed vigor. In
fact, for the first time operations
have developed on such a scale
as to make it' clear that the
battle of retirement is over. The
Jews had drawn in to their per-
missible limit and the Arabs were
“Quick, Boss — he's done the drawback !”
beginning to meet main resist-
ance.
They have now overflowed the
central hill area and their drives
from the east are on the fringes
of the coastal plain or, in parts
of the north, actually on it,
running down the roads and
disputing control of the lateral
railway. The policy of the Arabs
t seems to be to ignore all ob-
jectives save Tel Aviv and its
satellite towns, on which they
are converging. Capture of Tel
Aviv would put them in posses-
sion of the very heart of Jewish
resistance and split the Jewish
forces.
The Jews, whose mobility in
defence will increase with their
constriction, are faced with the
urgent need of stopping both
the north and south drives, one
of which is pushing into Sam-
aria. Defence in this area has
centred round Jewish attempts
to regain the important road
and rail town of Jenin, south
of the oil-pipeline and the rail-
way which runs from Haifa
through Nazareth into Trans-
jordan, a valuable asset in the
hands of the Arabs. The Jews
claimed to have broken through
the outer defences of Jenin at
the week-end.
In the south the same kind of
operation has been directed to
stop the progress of the
Egyptians at Esdud, on the way
from Gaza. This drive is very
important to the Jews, since it
directly menaces some of the
most concentrated areas of Jew-
ish settlement as well as the
Lydda-Ramleh aerodrome area.
Up to June 7 the war was
developing on purely tactical
lines, neither side paying the
slightest military attention to the
operations of U.N.O. and its
emissary Count Bernadette, who
was frantically flying from H.Q.
to H.Q, in an endeavor to bring
about agreement for the truce.
He had not succeeded, though it
was reported in more optimistic
quarters that hopes for a settle-
ment had improved. The main
stumbling-block —the refusal of
the Jews to bar immigration,
even of men of military age,
during the armistice —is a hard
one to get over.
From a military viewpoint the
Arabs held the offensive still on
all fronts on June 7, having
apparently at least temporarily
beaten off the main Jewish deter-
rent attack at Jenin, while the
Egyptians began their investment
of the group of Jewish towns
and cities which centre round Tel
Aviv, of which some of their
forces were reported to be within
14 miles on the night of June 6.
The real strength of the oppos-
ing armies should be tested with-
in the coming week for the first
time.
"The Bulletin" Cup.
The second year’s shoot among
senior school-cadet corps in N.
S. Wales for The Bulletin Cup
resulted in another win for
St. John’s College, Woodlawn,
Northern Rivers (N.S.W.).
The trophy is shot for by
teams of ten firers, with a pos-
sible of 1250 points. In the case
of a tie, decision rests with the
team making the highest score
on Practice No. 4 (controlled
application).
The standard of shooting was
generally improved. St. John’s
won with a fine score of 1056,
against 938 last year. Sydney
C. of E. Grammar School
(Shore) replaced Scots in second
place with 1003, and Sydney
Grammar School jumped from
30th place and a score of 633
to third place and a score of
978. Though The King’s School
and Scots College were a trifle
lower on the list, their scores
showed a marked improvement,
■as did those of most of the
great public schools.
The showing, indeed, was
better right down to the six-
teenth place.
The disappointing feature was
the poorer shooting of many of
the State high schools. Big
schools such as Canterbury
High, Fort Street, Taree, Forbes,
Parramatta, Cowra, Orange and
Dubbo were low on the list, and
Sydney High, which last year was
fourth with a score of 862, was
only 37th with 531. Perhaps
there was some special reason.
This, however, does not get
away from the fact that the State
schools, which should have the
best facilities for instruction and
the organisation of teams, are
not generally up to the standards
of the great public and denomi-
national schools. The exceptions
were Glen Innes (7th with 881),
North Sydney High (Bth with
863), Goff’s Harbor High (9th,
837), Armidale High (10th, 822),
Grafton High (11th, 773).
However, there is no doubt
that, in the words of Lieutenant-
General F. H. Berryman, G.O.C.
Eastern Command, the competi-
tion “has stimulated great inter-
est in the cadet units and is
doing much to add to the stan-
dard of service rifle-shooting.”

The B.C.O.F. Report.
“Ek Dum”; The second report
on the condition of 8.C.0.F.
—that of Major-General C. E
M. Lloyd, formerly Adjutant-
General, and Mr. Massey
Stanley, a journalist—differs in
some respects from that of the
chaplains, but confirms the fact
that “blackmarketing is negli-
gible, the general conduct of the
troops good and their morale
high.”
There are, however, sonje re-
marks on V.D., the incidence of
which is reported to he “still
high,” causing the investigators
to comment that it’s “extraordi-
nary that the Joint Chiefs of
Staff should have taken no action
on the subject since 1946 beyond
calling for weekly returns”:
The only instruction i 5.... that
medical officers and unit commanders
give frequent lectures to all men on
the control of preventable diseases.
The report adds that the
American system is to discharge
officers and men who contract
V.D., and apparently the repor-
ters are in favor of this measure.
It says little for the discretion
of the Minister for the Army
that this report was issued. It
has been published by the press
in summarised forms, which in
many cases create an entirely
wrong impression of the serious-
ness of the position, giving cause
for unnecessary anxiety to rela-
tives of soldiers and certainly not
doing a service to recruiting.
The facts apparently are that
the incidence of diseases is about
as common in Japan as it is
anywhere a force is stationed in
the Orient. The American sys-
tem is not a good one. The fact
that those affected know that
they will be discharged if
detected with certain affections
is an incentive to concealment
rather than a prevention. And
concealment in mild cases —•
which are most dangerous from
the point of view of the spread of
the disease —is easy.
One point which has not been
touched on by the Minister or
the inquirers whose peregrina-
tions have cost the country quite
a large sum of money is the
source of the blanket allega-
tions against the general morals
and behavior of the Japan Force.
Somebody in Parliament should
discover who the author of these
charges is, whether he is a civil
servant and what has happened
to him.
In view of the general base-
lessness of most of the charges
and their effect on recruiting, the
matter should not be allowed to
remain where it is.
"Labor" and Defence.
“Ek Dum”: When the Can-
berra Trades and Labor Council
was asked to send a represen-
tative to a meeting called by the
R.S.S.A.I.L.A. to discuss the re-
formation of Canberra’s local
militia battalion, a Mr. O’Neill
(A.W.U.) was reported to have
said:
I have never found the military
authorities had anything in common
with the workers.
He moved a resolution that the
letter should be acknowledged
and that it was “not the council’s
function to assist in organising
military matters.” This was
carried.
The significant fact is that this
has not called for any protest
by the Minister for the Army or
any other leader of Labor. And
there has been no repudiation
by A.W.U. headquarters of the
viewpoint expressed.
It says little for so-called
Labor, one of whose favorite
Ministers, condemning the
Menzies Government for not
having the country in a state of
readiness when war broke out
with Japan in 1941, shouted that
he would “like to prosecute
criminally the guilty men” who
had left the country undefended.
That same Minister was so
moved at the time that he did
not feel that the evil invention
of the Brisbane Line libel was
beyond the bounds of fair play.
But Mr, Ward is silent about this
latest industrial Labor move to
obstruct and discourage Labor’s
official policy of a citizen army,
as are the other patriots who
are with him in the Ministry.
A feature of the aftermaths
of World War II has been the
tendency to forget anniversaries.
Victory day in May was almost
entirely ignored, officially and
otherwise, in Australia, and the
same applied to the day of the
Normandy landing. Both these
events were celebrated in other
countries concerned, though not
with much fervor.

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Queried as to the glum expression
he was sporting at Randwick on
Saturday, one regular and pretty solid
punter replied, “I’m not doing too
well under the new rules.” “What new
rules?” he was asked. “No doping!’
A surprising number did, in fact,
“blame” fear, in some quarters, of
the AJ.C.’s recent anti-doping cam-
paign for the string of upsets suf-
fered by followers of form on Satur-
day. A slight effort of memory—a
feat of which most punters seem
singularly incapable—might have sug-
gested that it was, perhaps, just an-
other example of tricky winter
form that happens every year.
After all, one equal second-favorite
came home at 9 to 2; at the corre-
sponding meeting last year the short-
est-priced winner was an 8-to-l pop.
The year before that spme of the
winners were Royal Spirit (33 to 1),
Johnny Zero (10 to 1), Miss Sovereign
(15 to 1), Rouge d’Or (§ to 1), and
Lady Marie (10 to 1).
Aloof from the conflicting throng
of stricken punters and joyous
bookies, the happiest person present
on Saturday must have been Bayly
Payten’s apprentice Ray Selkrig, who
attained the height of a 71b. appren-
tice lad’s ambition by landing a treble
of winners at headquarters. Most
punters would prefer to forget all
about them.
Young Selkrig, a really promising
rider, kicked off with a good display
of pace-judgment to take the 12-
furlongs Novice on Beau Felt (40
to 1), leading all the way to down
Rockfellow and Robin Bon. The
winner returned tote-bettors £l6 14s.
for five shillings each way. Then
Selkrig was successful on My Request,
a Beaupartir gelding having its first
start in a race, and much too good
for High Spirits, Blue Lagoon and
others in the second Two-year-old
Encourage; My Request paid
£l3 os. 6d. for five bob each way.
Later Selkrig, by purely vigorous rid-
ing, won the Homestead Handicap
(lOf.) on Alkestu, beating Booma-
nulla narrowly, with Herbert River
a distant third. After winning on
Beau Felt Selkrig moved up a class,
and rode his other two winners with
a 51b. allowance.
Another 71b. apprentice saw the
light in the. Flying Handicap when
the Brazen gelding Atherdon, sooled
along vigorously over the final half-
furlong by A., Hazelton, won very
easily from Verbage and .Brnzie •
Fourth, and worth remembering, was
Persian Prince.
Possibly the most noteworthy win-
ner of the day was J. C. Bendrodt s
handsome grey colt Snow Star (E.
Fordyce), comfortably downing Far-
away and Valiant Blade in the mile
Three-year-old Encourage. This
Rogerstone Castle colt has had only
four starts, the first nearly a year
back. The last three, on successive
Saturdays, have yielded a close second
and two wins.
One of Emborough’s best, apart
from his masterpiece Bernborough,
Homeleigh Dick ran out a good win-
ner of the mile George’s River Handi-
cap with consistent Slander second.
The first Two-year.-old Encourage was
won very easily by the Hua geld-
ing San Domenico (V. Faggotter),
having his first start in a race, and
Regal Light (N. Sellwood) took the
Welter.

Melbourne punters had no sym-
pathy to waste on their northern
brethren; locally (at Moonee Valley)
the battle was quite tough enough.
.Nevertheless, they were on the right
track for this time of the year, since
the double of jumping events provided
the only decent results of the day.
Interesting runners in the Port Phil-
lip Hurdle were Royal Title and Gal-
lant Gentleman, a couple of decent
performers on the flat, who would
need only an ounce of jumping ability
to enter National considerations, but
neither distinguished himself. Start-
ing second-favorite at threes, the win-
ner was Reynard (F.-Dummett), whose
recent form had suggested a lack ot
stamina.
There was rather more class about
the Williamstown Steeple, and proven
jumpers shared the finish; old Krallis
(R. Hall) ran out a convincing winner
from Priority and Garofil. Krallis
has won at three of his last four starts
over the fences and started favorite.
The 13-furlongs Point Cook Handi-
cap saw another fair jumper in Latani
land the money, but a starting price
of 25 to 1 did not suggest general
enthusiasm. Still, good hurdlers are
always worthy of respect in a purely
plugging flat race where they carry
a couple of stone below their accus-
tomed weight.
Giving rider N. Powell the first leg
of an unpopular double, the three-
year-old John James colt Beau John
(9 to 1), after a run of failures against
horses of his own age, whipped open
company in the mile Esplanade
Handicap. The second leg of Powell’s
double was Tamerlane (15 to 1),
taking the second Marine Handicap
(6f.) from High Flight and Mahram.
The first spasm of the Marine gave
punters nearly as tough a trot, going
to Solray (W. Smith) at twelves with
Jalna and Our Land placed. In the
mile Juvenile Handicap there was a
solid betting plunge on the Westralian
galloper British Myth, but Mrs. M.
Niall’s excellently-named filly Rustic
Glow (Sun Valley-Village Belle),
ridden by E. Preston, made an ex-
hibition of the field; five lengths to
"Only one more , boy , and we're home and hosed!"
Young Geoff and a further three
lengths to the favorite.

A couple of weeks back, Australian
rider “Togo” Johnstone, unable to
attend a dinner for jockeys with
mounts in the English Derby, sent
them a wire reading “My love to all.
There was more to it than meets the
eye, Johnstone’s Derby mount being
the French horse My Love, and on
Saturday he justified the prophetic
telegram, becoming the first Australian
rider to win the Derby.
Apart from all the honor, glory and
cold cash, there was deep, personal
satisfaction for Johnstone in winning
the Derby. Some years back he rode
the red-hot favorite Colombo and,
after finishing only third, came iu
for a terrific and quite unjust roast-
ing by English critics.
My Love, who was solidly backed
from 100 to T down to 100 to 9, won
very easily from Royal Drake and
Noor. He is a son of Vatellor, who
also sired the 1947 winner, Pearl Diver.
A curious feature of the result was
the manner in which two men shared
all the prizemoney. My Love is
owned jointly by the Aga Khan and
French owner Leon Volterra. Vol-
terra also owns Royal Drake, while
the Aga Khan owns Noor.

After giving a couple of very feeble
exhibitions, Shannon returned to favor
in America last week by winning the
50,000-dollar Argonaut Handicap
(B£f.) before a record crowd of 71,000
at Hollywood Park, California. He
won comfortably enough from
Mafosta and his own stablemate On
Trust. In popular opinion he was
the rank outsider of the field but paid
only 2 to 1 on the tote, owing to the
commendable American custom of
bracketing horses from the same
stable.
Shannon’s cut of the prize was
£A10,125, bringing his earnings in
America to £13,212 —a fair indication
of the very high scale of prizemoney
over there. Shannon’s in-and-out form
suggests two possible explanations.
Either that he is sour and only does
his best when the mood takes him,
or that he has not been suited by
the American style of riding. Most
American riders are bustlers —hard at
work on their mounts from go to
whoa. Johnny Adams, who rode
Shannon for the first time in the
Argonaut, gave him plenty of time to
settle down, which, Adams himself
said, would not be his method with
an American horse.

The Kentucky Derby this year
went to Citation, beating his
stablemate Coaltown with My Re-
quest third. Citation was strongly
fancied for the historic race; he has
now won 15 races from 17 starts,
and collected well over £lOO,OOO in
stakes. He was ridden by the leading
American jockey Eddie Arcaro, scor-
ing his fourth success in the classic.

Jamaican runner Herb McKenley
must have been well off form when
he ran with so little success out here
recently. In New York on Saturday
he went on the track with the ex-
pressed intention of running 440 yards
in 46sec., and did so, breaking his
own world record.

Norman von Nida appears to be
off again on his annual clean-up of
the respectable prizemoney available
in English golf. First prize of £3OO
sterling in the Spalding tournament
at St. Andrew’s last week brought his
winnings for three weeks to more
than £BOO sterling.
Commencing bis preparation for
Wimbledon, John Bromwich had a
treble success in the Northern lawn-
tennis championships played at Man-
chester. He won the singles, part-
nered Jock Harper successfully in
the men’s doubles and took the mixed
doubles with England’s Mrs. Jean
Bostock.

The Australians in England:
Rain welcomed the tourists to
Southampton, where Hampshire, sent
in by Hassett, was out for 195. The
soft pitch responded beautifully to
Bill Johnston’s wiles, enabling him to
bag 6 for 74 off 38 overs; the other
“Johnno” took 2 for 35. In their
turn, the Australian batsmen floun-
dered around to scrape up a mere
117 —the first time that they had been
headed on the first innings. However,
with Miller (5 to 25) and Johnston
(5 for 43) sharing the honors, Hamp-
shire was bundled out for 107 in its
second knock. On an improved pitch
the Australians then raised the neces-
sary at a loss of only two wickets.
Sussex, about the weakest of the
county clubs, was bombarded at Hove
on Saturday, and rapidly sought
cover; all out for 86, with Lindwall
taking six for 34, including five clean-
bowled. The Sussex men would have
been in even worse plight but for their
Oakes brothers, who put up 22 and
15 respectively, the only double-
figure scores of their side. When the
day closed the Australian openers
were having a grand time with 254
on the board for the loss of one
wicket (Brown 44, Morris 152 n. 0.,
and Bradman 43 n. 0.).

There was a lull on the Sydney
Rugby Union front last Saturday
while New South Wales played Com-
bined Australian Universities and City
played Country. Queensland medical
student Charlie Elliott did all the
scoring for the Universities, register-
ing 15 points from five penalty goals,
but his side was no match for the
State team, which won 31-15. The
very scratchy team representing City
had to work hard downipg Country
29-14.

Melbourne’s football followers
made the Fitzroy-Essendon game the
match of the day on Saturday and
got a solid, battling spectacle, with
field and boundary umpires issuing
warnings to the battlers. Fitzroy
held their -V.F.L. tpp place by 12.8
to 9.10. Best finish was between
Collingwood and Melbourne —a last
quarter of fast and clever play leav-
ing it with ’Wood, 11.17-11.10. Rich-
mond bolted in the third quarter of
the match against Carlton, slapping
on 7.4 to 0.3 and winning 13.10 to
9.21. Footscray, beaten 11.6-8.9 by
the hitherto-ignored North Melbourne,
suffered as big a blow to its self*
esteem as the rising Geelong side,
which, on its own ground, was wal-
loped by “Sowth,” 19.12-15.16. St,
Kilda ran true to form, stuck dog-
gedly to lowest place on the list and
was beaten by Hawthorn, 10.12-7.12.
* * * ♦
Fighting fiercely through the early
rounds, and making full use of his
extra weight, Charlie Ward (9.1)
seemed sure to beat Ray Coleman
(8.11), but a left to the body floored
Ward in the fifth round and took all
the sting from his attack. There-
after Coleman, displaying plenty of
speed, placed his punches with
judgment and piled up the points to
receive a popular decision.

Closely resembling Dawson, and
looking a class above other recent
importations, American negro Tommy
Stenhouse (9.8) made a very even
match for Vic. Patrick (9.7) at Sydney
Stadium. As Dawson had done, Sten-
house countered Patrick’s southpaw
style by continually leading with his
right and scored repeatedly. Patrick
appeared to tire towards the finish,
but rallied to win the final round,
which gave him the decision.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Wippegong”: When Hargrave chose
the Stanwell Park bluff from which to
launch his box-kites he had good pre-
cedent ; for any day along those steep
coasts you can see experts making play
with the air currents that curl up the
sandstone cliffs from the sea. Poised
above the land, the kestrels hover awhile
over the grassy edges; then, easing into
a gentle side-slip, catch the lift at the lip
of the precipice and rise like blown
thistledown. To alight on a ledge they
rise or fall as they wish, merely reaching
out the feet in a negligent manner when
at the exact millimetre desired above the
perch ; while to take-off they simply step
off and are airborne. Now and again they
pounce in a blase sort of way, tear casu-
ally at something in the grass, then
spread the wings and once more are lifted
and carried where they wish at the flick of
a feather, all by the restless air that rolls
above the breakers. They nest in the in-
accessible crannies plentiful along the
colorful cliffs of N.S.W., and apparently
find enough to eat, for pairs use the same
restricted territory all the year round.
Now and again I’ve seen a slim talon
raised daintily to the head bent to meet
it, but could never make out whether the
bird was nibbling or merely stifling a
yawn.
* * * *
“Laetitia”: Though the shot was dis-
charged over open sights the marksman-
ship was excellent, considering the zoom-
ing plane of the quarry. Rising right
from the waterline, the curving trajectory
coincided with the path of the target just
as the projectile commenced its descent.
For a split-second the target seemed to
shiver, then plummeted down in erratic
spirals to the water. Thus does the rifle-
fish, with his barest snout-tip protruding
above surface, stalk his insect quarry
under the overhanging mangroves. In
the sureness of his marksmanship the
submarine sharpshooter no sooner de-
livers his watery missile than he makes a
beeline for the spot, calculated with un-
canny precision, at which his lately-air-
borne dinner will hit the water so that
it disappears into his distended muzzle.
* * * *
“Hanko”: A bird that has always in-
trigued me is the scissors-grinder. Appear-
ing suddenly out of nowhere it will breast
up to a stump or post and, hovering
thereat for a minute or so, make its queer
grinding noise ; then it is gone in a quick,
throbbing flight. But its hovering stunt
is what corrugates my brow. Completely
enfolding its body at each beat of its
so-slowly flapping wings, the ’grinder
somehow stays put in the air when by all
laws of reason and logic it should drop
to the ground; a truly puzzling perform-
ance. And useless to seek this strange
wee pied fowl. In city street, bush-clad
hillside or far-back plain, it comes, hovers
and grinds awhile and is gone—a veritable
phantom of a bird,
* * * *
“Lower Tops’!”: Mention in these col-
umns recently of the Alphild and Brier
Holme wrecks and of the terrible priva-
tions tie survivors suffered on Tassie’s
uninhabited, rugged west coast recalls an-
other lesser-known tragedy there. In
June, 1904, the 200-ton Hobart-owned
barque Acacia passed Maatsuyker Island
lighthouse—to the . southward of The
Speck—bound for Adelaide in a terrific
nor’-westerly gale, and then went missing.
Later, as a search on the west coast re-
vealed no wreckage, the little bluegum-
built sailer was forgotten. Meanwhile
in the bush at Fitzgerald, near the
headwaters of the Derwent, an uniden-
tified man was found dead. He was
dressed like a sailor, but as Fitzgerald is
separated from the west and south coasts
by a 50-mile barrier of almost impassable
bush nobody placed any importance on
the circumstance. But in March of the
following year, when searching for sur-
vivors from the Brier Holme, the fish-
ing boat Gift came on the wreck of the
Acacia under water at Mainwaring Inlet,
40 miles north of Port Davey. Several
skeletons were found nearby. It was
then realised that the dead man found
near Fitzgerald was from her crew—pro-
bably the mate. He had died of starva-
tion within reach of help after traversing
on foot 60 miles of the toughest country
in the Commonwealth.
* * * *
“Eastern”: Every year in the late
autumn along comes a thrush to live in
my garden. There is never more than
one, but upon inquiry I find that half a
dozen other houses a few miles distant in
different directions have their one pet
thrush that collects scraps round their
doors in winter. Last year my little grey
bird grew quite tame, hopping up to take
grubs from my hand when gardening, or
parking himself on my boots. With first
hints of spring he learned to answer my
whistle ; perched nearby, his throat would
swell and quiver in a glorious all-out
effort, prompted by my encouragement.
He was distinguishable by his slightly
slimmer build, and a brownish tint on
some, of his feathers. As spring settled in
he disappeared. A fortnight ago a thrush
“Do you know anything about stuffing animals?”
arrived on the verandah, and has now
taken up residence in the garden. All my
old enticements, however, bring no re-
sponse. The brown tinge on the feathers,
too, is gone, though this might be the
outcome of moulting. Could someone tell
me: does a bird usually return to its
accustomed locality after the mating
season, or am I wasting effort on a
stranger?
* * * *
“Naturala”: The copper sheathing of
that surveying sloop’s dinghies (B.
5/5/’4B) was pierced from the inside.
Moored for considerable periods along-
side the mother-ship, such craft became
more or less waterlogged. The teredo
hatches from a tiny egg. Hatched and
free-swimming, the infant worm seeks a
home and sustenance. It might be readily
washed into a boat, where it would attack
the inside of the planking. Being so tiny,
its entrance into a plank is through a
hole seldom larger than the head of a
pin. Inside the plank it ate and grew,
attaining perhaps, dependent on species,
to the thickness of a man’s finger. Finally
at adult size it felt nature’s most urgent
call —to re-enter the sea and there propa-
gate its kind. Instinct led it to the sea-
washed side of the planking, but there
a thickness of copper barred exit. The
labor would be intense, but with its
long worm body gripping the sides of
its tunnel it could obtain sufficient pres-
sure to enable its hard, sharp-cutting jaws
to rasp the comparatively soft metal
through. The holes weren’t made from
the outside, for no teredo loose in the
water would be able to obtain enough
purchase anywhere to start operations.
Secondly, being adult, with its feeding
days over, it wouldn’t have the desire,
“Nor’-west”: The point is that no
matter how carefully the modern sub-
marine cable is laid (B. 5/5/’4B) it is
impossible entirely to safeguard against
the action of the sea. At 1000 ft. the
ocean is swept by powerful currents;
even at five miles down it is far from
passive. So, just as it is with the seabed
that we can observe to a depth of 100 ft.
or so, the ocean-bed at miles down may
have thousands of tons of sand or silt
swept within a short period from one
place to another. Thus a cable carefully
laid in the beginning may end by being
suspended across a ravine gouged out by
a vagrant current. Just how powerful aie
the currents in the depths of the sea is
told in the journals of ships such as the
Challenger, engaged in submarine ex-
ploration. In the Southern Ocean, for
instance, a dredge-net, weighted with a
mere hundredweight, will not sink to the
bottom, even at the end of miles of line.
Actually there are places where the
dredge couldn’t be got to the bottom, the
tonnage necessary for a sinker being
beyond the strength of any available line
to hold against the current. When such
currents become vagrant, as happens at
times, they gouge at the ocean-bed like
million-horsepower bulldozers.
“Colonial Cove”; If copper sheathing
offers little protection against the teredo
(B. 5/5/’4B), how then did the colonial
clippers, most of them built of American
pine, withstand the “shipworm”? The
Lightning, built in 1854, shuttled
between Liverpool and Melbourne until
burned at Geelong in 1869. Yet, though
she had sailed through all the zones
of the teredo, her hull remained as sound
as when built. Copper protected her and
her colonial sisters. But for copper the
world would never have been explored.
Only two timbers have real immunity
from the teredo: pitchpine and Cali-
fornian redwood. With a lesser immunity
rank teak, oak and jarrah. Pitchpine is
heavy. Viking galleys built of it were
slow to sail and oar. So the other North
European pines were mostly used. Which
is why Ireland so largely escaped Viking
raids, the Irish Sea being dreaded because
of the shipworm. The main reason why
the ancients seldom ventured on the wide
ocean was not so much the fear of be-
coming lost as the fear of the worm
bringing planks to the condition, of a
colander far from land. When copper
sheathing was invented the oceans began
to be explored. Copper and muntz metal
—which is zinc and copper—have long
enabled ships to defy the teredo. Even
a paint mixed with copper-dust will give
immunity for a season.
*
“Goldie”: Particles of silica and mica,
so fine they float in the air, are the cause
of dusted lungs of miners working below
the surface. Before the advent of jack-
hammers the complaint was more or less
restricted to deep and poorly ventilated
mines. Dry-boring with hammers played
a great deal of havoc with “dust,” so wet-
boring, with water forced through hollow
steel drills, was commonly adopted.
Therein lies a source of trouble where
equipment is faulty. Vaporisation of
water, which will occur when it is mauled
in pockets of compressed-air, has to be
guarded against. Each globule in the
vapor takes as its nucleus a minute par-
ticle of dust, which in this form settles on
the lungs more readily than dry dust. It
mostly depends on whether the water-
spear through the hammer is taking the
liquid right inside the hollow drill at a
lower pressure than the compressed-air
behind it. No pockets are then available
to agitate and create the dangerous
vapor.
* * * *
“Betcha”: Most people are awake-up
to an old duck ? s broken-down tactics, but
it is amusing to see newchums fall for the
same trick in playful-minded animals.
Like the other day when young Andy was
lending me a hand with a fence.
He spotted my useless mong labor-
ing along on the tail of a hare.
“By cripes, he can nearly catch
it,” he said, watching the chase. “See
that? Almost had him on that turn.
Gosh, wait till I get Ginger, he’s got a lot
more speed than Flop.” Andy hastily un-
tied his pride and joy, and yelled en-
couragement. My dog dropped in the
rear as Andy’s took over, following just
a foot or two behind the quarry, Down
the flat they went, Andy expending nearly
as much energy as the dog, then a few
exciting skirmishes and they turned and
came back past the job. “G’on, Ging e f>
get into it,” bawled his enthusiastic
owner, and Ginger got into it to gain a
few inches and lose them immediately.
Presently the hare tired of the game and,
dropping his ears, scooted up the spur and
over the distant ridge, leaving the ludi-
crous mong behind as though he were
stationary. For a minute I got nothing
but Andy’s back as he stared after
the hare; then with a sheepish grin
he returned to the job without comment.
* * ♦ *
“Old-timer”: In his covered wagonette
Jim Treloar drove slowly to the pub at
Lascelles. The horse stopped of its own
accord, the dog underneath flopped imme-
diately into the dust. Jim eyed the little
group on the verandah. “G’day, Jim,
one said. “It’s hot.” Jim fondled his
chin meditatively, looked sideways and
back again. “Not’sot as yestidee,” he
said, the hint of a challenge in his voice.
“Aw, she must be,” was the reply. “I can
tell be the heat.” Jim stole another side-
ways look. “Betcha she ain’t. You don’t
know hot from cold.” There was mild
argument between verandah and wagon-
ette, and, in the end, bets were made.
They adjourned to the bar, irrigated twice,
informed Bung that the loser would pay,
and invited him to ring the post-office and
check. The post-office made the day
seven degrees cooler than the previous
one. Jim wiped his lips, got back
wagonette and prepared to depart. By
cripes,” marvelled the loser, “you’re a bit
of a wonder t’ be able t’ tell a little dif-
ference like that.” “Yair,” agreed Jim,
clucked to the horses, and, with another
sidelong glance at the thermometer tied
to the hood-strut, drove slowly away.
* * * *
“Zake”: Anyone who went out ring-
barking without an axe would generally
be considered a bit gone in the dome,
but an agriculturist I struck out from
Muswellbrook (N.S.W.) scorned the use
of Plumb or Kelly in his back paddock.
It carried a lush growth of saplings, and
the philistine was getting around them
with a big wrench. A few twirls of the
screw, the wrench would be opened or
closed as necessary to fit the sapling, and
with a couple of turns the job was done.
He reckoned he could do a couple of
hundred more a day than with the axe,
and with less effort.

“X.E.D.”: It Vvas local tradition for
Ted Benson to have the rabbit-trapping
rights of Shanty Creek. His father had
trapped there for years before him, and
no other had ventured on that territory
with traps. But Jorgie hopped in early
one season and lifted a large number of
bunnies before Ted knew what was going
on. Ted was priming himself for the
warpath one Saturday when Jorgie
arrived at the pub. Steve hurriedly got
him aside. “Look out f’r that Benson,
he cautioned. “He’s out f’r a of
y’r hide.” “Aw, there ain’t nothin t
fight over,” Jorgie said. “He doesn’t
own the rabbits up there any more than
anyone else. I wouldn’t fight him. But
he’s likely t’ swing at y’ first an’ reason
things out after,” Steve said. “Well, I
ain’t fightin’ him or anyone else,” Jorgie
said. “There’s no sense in it. Y’ both
git knocked about f’r nothin’. No fightin
f’r me, thanks. Still, if Benson rushed
me swingin’ punches —well, I—l’d dong
the blank!”

“Perseverando”: The first Jap to be
made prisoner on Australian soil was
captured by an abo. During the first
bombing attack on Darwin in February,
1942, a Zero had its oil-pipe damaged
by ack-ack fire, and the pilot, pancaking
down on Melville Island, got off with
a few scratches in the crash-landing. He
wandered about for two days before
stumbling across a blacks’ camp. The
men had gone to Bathurst Island Mis-
sion for rations, and the first to see the
strange airman was a two-year-old
piccaninny, who ran screaming to the
nearest gin. She snatched him up, and,
with all the others, ran off, leaving a
three-months-old baby in a bark shelter.
The Jap picked this chap up and started
crooning to him. The mother asked one
of the gins, who had be,en with Jap
pearlers before the war, to go back and
ask for her baby. When the Jap handed
it over they cleared out again, a revolver-
shot hastening their flight. Late in the
afternoon the men came back, and one
of them named Matthias ordered him
to “Stick ’em up.” The tired, hungry
and now-frightened Jap complied.
The blacks took away his revolver
and maps, and next day marched their
prisoner to the beach m Apsley Stirait.
opposite Bathurst Island Mission Station,
and, using a dugout canoe, took tom
across to the troops stationed nearby
Later an abo. named Jerry backtracked
the Jap airman to the crashed Zero and
explained every move he had made, to
lucid exposition completely
cock-and-bull story told by the Jap to
interrogating R.A.A.F. men.
UP IN THE FOREST.
Where mountain ash anti messmate
Grace the forest wide and deep,
Their trunks like massive columns
Climbing up each rugged steep,
It’s good to hear the axeman
Come whistling along the track.
His lips pursed like a schoolboy’s,
And his axe upon his back.
Oh, there’s music in the morning
As with zest he strides along,
And the magpies high above him
Catch the sunlight in their song
And the cockatoos in treetops
Stretching aisle on greeny aisle,
With their yellow crests uplifted
Join the din in raucous style.
And there’s music in the forest,
Let the world say what it will,
In the blowing of the whistle
At the hidden timber-mill,
In the ringing of the axes
And the crash of giants strong
And the timber-men’s clear voices
And the saw’s relentless song.
VICTORIA.

“Hey! Do y Want ALL the line to yourself P’
“B. A. Ker”: In big Alick’s make-up
there is a fervent admiration for skill
and fine workmanship, in complete con-
tradiction to the side of his character
that revels in a good brawl —if it comes
to him. Back from the Big Noise he
was in raptures about the wonders
housed in Sydney Technological Mu-
seum. The table inlaid with umpteen
thousand different pieces of wood; the
bluebird mosaic tray; Hargrave’s ex-
perimental models that flew before real
aeroplanes did; the scale model of
Cook’s Endeavour, etc. Outside he had,
it seemed, wandered around to the en-
trance of the college proper. Here, more
exquisite craftsmanship had taken his
eye—the goannas and ’possums playing
over the stone arches, though showing
the effects of time and weather, were still
“a marvellous bit of stone-carvin’.” At
this stage George asked: “What was the
cleverest piece of work you saw in Syd-
ney?” Alick thought carefully before
giving a decision: “Well, just before I
left I was standin’ admiring a bit of brick-
work in front of a flash hotel when a
fruit-barrow bloke started up: ‘Best
bananas, 20 a bob!’ I bought a bob’s
worth to eat in the train, but goin’ up
to the station the bag busted wide open.
I don’t know what made me count ’em
as I picked ’em up, but there was only
-18. Back I goes, ready to flatten the
robbin’ cow. But he’s quite nice about
it; he apologises for the mistake and fills
another bag for me, takin’ ’em right off
the top, counting ’em out one by one and
givin’ me two over to show there’s no
ill feeling.” The big fellow stopped talk-
ing ; it seemed he had lost all interest in
the case. “But what about that clever
bit of work you saw?” George re-
minded him. “That was it,” Alick
grinned ruefully. “When I got in the
train I found I only had 15 —and five of
them were rotten.”

“E. 2”: Mullins and Alec, his gawky
employee, were clearing logs and scrub in
the top paddock. At about 11 there
sounded a long-drawn, high-pitched note
from the direction’ of the low gap in the
hills. “What sort o’ critter makes that
noise?” Alec asked. “I’ve bin bearin’ it
at this time every day for nearly a week.”
Mullins grinned indulgently. “Aw, just a
dingo,” he said, “You listen about four
o’clock an’ y’ll hear him sing agen. Y’
know, Alec, y’ oughter nail that dawg.
The cockies’d sling a decent reward, be-
cause he’s bin takin’ their sheep f’r years.”
“I could shoot him if I had a
powerful rifle,” Alec said. “Yair?
Well, I’ll lend y’ that .303 of mine,”
Mullins said. “An’ there’s a few
rounds of ammo there y’ c’n have.
They’re a bit old now, so y’ll have t’ be
careful an’ not pull the trigger too hard or
y’ll have ’em bustin’ their cases an’ blowin’
a lump orf y’r dial.” Alec went on a hunt
on Sunday and returned late and very
tired. He was thoughtful for a long time
before making comment. “Funny how I
didn’t know before that the railway ran
up that bit of a valley over that low gap,”
he said slowly. “Must’ve bin the train-
whistle we was hearin’ on those clear days.
A bloke over there told me the train’s
bin takin’ a lot o’ sheep lately.” He
mooched off gloomily to his hut. Mul-
lins’s conscience pinched him for days
till he salved it by coming to light with a
ten-bob rise.

“The Rabbiter”: White bullocks cer-
tainly have a physical weakness (B.
5/5/’4B), but they make up for it in in-
telligence. In the odd bullock-team left
about Gippsland or the Heywood district
of 'Victoria you never see a snowy worker
in the yoke except as a leader, as their
hides are so tender they chafe. But as
leaders, where they only have to interpret
their masters’ flowery orders and give a
lead to their bovine mates, there are none
better.

“Horseless Horseman”: “H.E.R.” is
right in stating “Hanko” and myself were
misinformed (B. 10/3/’4B) when we in-
ferred the native blackfish were indigen-
ous only to the rivers south of the Vic-
torian Divide. Blackies are found in
most streams from Cape York through to
Tassie. However, the northern fish —usu-
ally called slimies and rarely more than
half-a-pound in weight—are considerably
smaller than their Gippsland brothers, and
for decades it has been argued whether
or not the two are of different species.
Ichthyologists now agree all are black-
fish and that the northerners are merely
a different variety. Incidentally, Murray
cod —indigenous only to the Murray
and tributaries —are today also found
in the Yarra. A year ago a
five-pounder was hooked in the city by
Queen’s Bridge, History has it that in the
’seventies angling clubs transferred the
cod fry in barrels carried on packhorses
to Melbourne’s waterway. Tradition has
it that cod were first placed in the Yarra
even earlier by prospectors who brought
them across the Divide and placed them
in the headwaters in 1854.

“Macnell”: When the huge dockyard
crane now building on the Navy’s speci-
ally strengthened wharf at Garden Island
is finished, it will vie with the Bridge as
a harbor landmark. Rearing higher than
the bridge decking, its hammerhead jib
will lift a maximum test load of 312 j
tons, which means it can pluck a crui-
ser’s full turret out like a rotten tooth.
Designed by William Arrol, of Glasgow,
and building under supervision of the
Sydney Department of Works and Hous-
ing, the crane will be by far the most
powerful in Australia, probably in the
Southern Hemisphere. Its 1440 tons of
steel structure were fabricated by Sydney
Steel Co., at Marrickville, only mechan-
ised equipment—motors, blocks, etc. —
coming from England. Four 140 ft. towers
on which the jib revolves were sunk to
harbor bedrock in concrete-filled caissons,
and each can support 911 tons. A four-
roomed cottage would fit comfortably
between the towers. All mod. cons, are
there: electric lift for the driver, con-
trolling the giant’s strength from a tiny
cabin 160 ft. up in the jib, a baby six-ton
crane mounted for repair work, and auto-
matic braking if power fails. If the steel-
wire slings parted under a 250-ton load,
the horizontal jib could conceivably
whip off its training-racks. So an im-
mensely strong central locking-pin bolts
it to the supporting towers. The jib is
so long (nearly 300 ft.) wind pressure
could sway it; tons of slab-iron steady-
ing one end will prevent this. Designed
to service any capital warship afloat, the
crane’s completion will rate Garden
Island as the best-equipped dockyard
south of the Line,
“G.M.M.”: I doubt “Gagi’s” claim
(B. 19/5/’4B) that some birds and animals
are ventriloquists. Ventriloquism is to
the ear as perspective is to the eye ; there
is no such thing as “throwing the voice.”
The human ventriloquist attracts his
listeners’ attention to the place from which
he wishes his voice to be heard. In using
the distance voice he stamps on the floor
when speaking to a man in the basement,
and points to the ceiling when the voice
is to be heard from the floor above; or
he moves the lips of the dummy doll on
his knee. But how are birds and animals,
mostly unseen, to indicate where their
calls are to be heard?

“Flip”: Alf Bennett was known as a
hard man, but he used to tolerate his
daughter’s suitors as long as they kept out
of his way and went home early. One
of the unsuccessful lads even claims that
Alf once threw him a grin—though it
might have been a grimace. Alf was very
stunned to find the latest hopeful, a sur-
veyor’s young assistant working for the
council, rashly occupying his chosen
possie by the fire, and when the young
bloke was still burbling away at half-past
eleven Alf broke his stony silence. “I
hear you’re a surveyor. Can you use a
theodolite?” he asked. The young chap
beamed and declared that he could
make it talk. “Well, bring it up to-
morrow,” said Alf. “I want to find out
i \ it’s dead level from the back-steps to
the gate down by the road.” The next
day the surveyor’s offsider turned up with
a load of gear, and after working
for three hours was able to tell Alf that
to the 59th decimal it was as flat as a
billiard-table. Then he ventured the
afterthought: “What do you want it for,
Mr. Bennett—going to put down a pipe-
line?” “Well,” said Alf, “I just want to
be sure that if you haven’t left here at
a decent hour next time you call, kicking
you to the gate won’t be an uphill job!”

“C.E.”: It was late when Smithy even-
tually got his sheep counted out of the
sale-yards. “Righto, Charlie,” he yelled
to a gum-tree; “shoot this bunch up the
home road, and soon as they pick up
their way come back an’ lift the steers in
the end pen.” Smithy then dashed for
his nag, and drove the sheep hurriedly up
the road. Half an hour later he was
back, stringing out the steers. “Count
’em, Charlie,” he called. “And soon’s
we get well away, you hurry on and start
the milking. Gonna be in the dark
t’night. Shut the gate, too, Charlie, then
canter down f’r the mail. An’ for
heaven’s sake, Charlie, hold that flamin’
lead.” Propped on the fence, an old
yardman glanced round wonderingly.
“Well, he ain’t doin’ it,” he told Smithy.
“Never does,” came the snort. “That’s
Charlie all over. Wonder where the
cow’s got to now?” The yardman stared.
“Hey, but I thought old Charlie left y’ a
couple 6’ munce back,” he puzzled.
“Heard he went down country.” “That’s
right,” nodded Smithy, as he slammed
the gate, “but when a man’s got a thou-
sand things t’ do, an’ no time, it helps to
think old Charlie’s around somewhere to
lend a hand with things.”

“Chuck”: Have just been reading of
graziers who “employ” rabbiters to
“No fresh water! But if Leant get the salt out my perms ruined /”
the area. If prices are right and the
bunnies plentiful enough for him to rake
in 20 or more pounds a week he’ll work
the area until the cream of the harvest
is collected ; but stopping behind to clean-
up the strays would be as unthinkable as
digging out a burrow. Know one fiye-
day-weeker who agreed to ( trap an in-
fested paddock for the skins. His
efforts were half-hearted, and the result-
ant catch smaller than he had expected.
He blamed the rabbits —they wouldn’t
catch. Up came his traps, and meeting
me as he pulled out for better pastures,
he explained that a “trapper’d be a fool
wasting his time for a lousy 10 quid a
week these times.”

“Canine”: Any dog can do a very neat
divining act by picking, out of all your
garden, the exact spot where you’ve sunk
a rare bulb, dig it up, and leave it well
chewed on a foot-high pile of earth. The
answer is a “muffled mousetrap.” Wait
till he’s started digging, hurl a clod at
him and, when he’s not looking, set the
trap, its metal snapper bound with
string, in the bottom of his excavation.
His resumed digging operations go off
with a bang, and he will regard any un-
grassed land suspiciously for a long
while. Our spaniel, which, prior to the
experiment, had dug an elaborate set of
communication trenches through the rhu-
barb, gave a very good reaction by sitting
on the trap, and has led an exemplary
life ever since.
* * * *
“Bo”: The swaggie camped by the
roadside stared as the ancient grey pull-
ing the dray laden with firewood plodded
past. Perched on the dray was Joe
Gliddon, the township’s handyman ; from
the shafts hung out to dry a pillowslip,
a pair of pyjamas and a couple of singlets
and towels. Next morning his load was
comparatively light two hardwood
posts, a couple of crossbars and a roll
of wire. Joe was bound for the baker’s
to put up a new clothesline. From the
shafts this time there hung a shirt, two
pairs of bloomers, a, nightie, while a row of
about six socks were tacked to the shafts.
The swaggie was still camped there. As
the dray pulled abreast of him he sang
out: “G’day.” Then, pointing to the
shafts: “Wot, conductin’ a bargain sale? ”
Joe grinned down. “Aw, no,” he drawled
good-humoredly. “Got to get the missus’s
washin’ dry somehow. The kids busted
her clothesline durin’ the last school
holidays, and I ain’t had time to fix
another one up fer her yet,”
» * * *
“Esk D.”: “Y’ strike some odd charac-
ters in the cow-cockyin’ belt,” related Ben.
“There was Charlie Rebson, who’d
bought hisself a new suit when he was
married over 20 years back. It was one
o’ them styles with drainpipe trouser-legs,
an’ I never struck Charlie in the township
not wearin’ this shiny-black suit. It wasn’t
that Charlie was mean or too hard-up t’
get a new one, f’r he was makin’ plenty
from his cows. I had t’ take out a message
one day, an’ it was the first time I saw
Charlie in workin’ clobber dungaree
pants an’ old grease-stained coat. When
he got the message he reckoned it was
necessary t’ go into town. ‘Hey, missus,’
he bellowed. ' ‘Bring me good coat an’
“clean-up” their land. The article wasn’t
meant to be funny, but I’m wondering
how many years it is since a grazier who
makes any sort of fist of running his place
successfully has been able to employ a
rabbiter. Even on those neglected pro-
perties that swarm with the pests, tab-
biters can’t be persuaded to “clean-up”
hat.’ He peeled orf the coat he had on
an’ then took orf his trousers. Under-
neath was the drainpipe pair. ‘Good
stuff in them,’ he said proudly. He
waggled his o.s. feet. ‘Had a real job
gittin’ ’em on the day I was married, but
they won’t slip back over me feet. I
haven’t had ’em orf since.’ ”
GUN IN THE PARK.
Squat amidst the sunlit asters sits
The mossy monster dreaming of times gone,
When his great strength blew towers and men
to bits,
When his rust-stiffened muscles slid and shone.
In coral tombs deep-hidden from the eye
Rot ships of war when war has run its day,
But guns must mock us even as they die,
Surrounded by the children of their prey.
Foul monster rust and sink into rebirth
As sunlit blooms grow tall upon the stem
And children garlanded dance on the earth
Wherein you lie, and laugh your requiem.
Oh trundle no more monsters to the parks,
Nor keep them leashed and hungry in the
store,
But burn them, till the loving ploughshare marks
With curves of life the land they maimed
and tore!
VICTORIA.

“As Other Eyes.”
THE MAN ON THE LAND
"D ON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO GRAZCOS."
“CP.”: Walter Biggar, the
Scot who judged Shorthorns
and fats at Sydney R.A.S. Show,
has this to say;
“My first reactions to cattle
in the rings at Sydney were
of disappointment. The bulls
had a fair number of tops of an
acceptable class, but in younger
classes too many bulls were
shown which lacked true breed
character. I suggest that such
bulls should be very sparingly
used. Circumstances may alter
cases, but a more com-
pact, deeper-fleshed type, with
stronger underpinning and
bodies closer to the ground, and
with shorter heads, more promi-
nent eye and waxy flat horn,
would be conducive to earlier
maturing and easier-fed cattle.
“I did realise that owing to
a number of the animals being
for sale the standard in the show-
ring suffered to some extent.
It has been suggested that cattle
to suit areas where water is only
to be had at considerable dis-
tances need a fair length of leg.
I appreciate that, but I suggest
that it is not the length of leg
but the strength that matters;
and, as cattle “on the leg” are
more often more sparsely furn-
ished in other respects, I would
suggest aiming at cattle a little
closer to the ground, as you can
usually breed tall ones without
planning to do so.
“I was favorably impressed
with many attractive females
and herd bulls in both horned
and polled herds, which raised
my estimation of the breeds in
Australia,
“If societies and breeders aim
at putting up a good steer show
I’m sure it can be accomplished
if they select their cattle in
sufficient time to prepare them.
The surest way to success is in
selection. A champion steer is
a dual animal —it must yield a
maximum of the finest cuts that
the consumer demands, and at
the same time it must be an
efficient beef-producing machine,
retaining the substance, vigor
and capacity to consume food-
stuffs profitably. The qualities
that make a thick carcass, rich
in red meat and tender with
marbled fat can readily be
recognised in the live animal.
“The good beef steer should
stand squarely on his legs. His
bone should be strong and cap-
able of supporting his body-
weight at all times. Further-
more, he should be able to walk
easily. The natural food of the
beef animal is grass, and to get
it he must walk about, grazing.
If his underpinning is light and
delicate, he cannot lead a
natural existence. If it is sturdy,
he can carry the load of beef
which we want him to develop.”
Cane Pests.
“X Bar B”: The par. by
“Sarina” (B. 267 5/’4B) was well
timed; there has been a marked
increase in the spread of con-
volvulus and Star of Bethlehem
creepers, but a lot of cane-
growers will disagree that the
giant mimosa is a curse. The
“sensitive plant,” as it is other-
wise known, is nitrogenous, and*
many a worn-out area given
over to “the curse,” whilst pro-
viding a good grazing in a dry
time, has been restored to first-
class cane land after a few years.
At any rate, opinions on the
value of “sensitive” weed vary,
“Thap”: Mackay (Q.) cane-
farmers who have low-lying
areas subject to wireworms—
tough, hardy pests which mature
into the familiar “click” beetles
after chewing out all the young
shooting buds of the cane sets
planted in the wetter ground—
are cheering the entomologist
at the Sugar Experiment Station.
He announces that a mixture
of some 201 b. of a dust called
“gammexane” with the fertiliser
in the drill at planting-time is
very deadly to the insects. The
Canegrowers’ Executive Office at
Mackay has a picture showing
rows where untreated cane
failed to come through, whereas
adjoining treated rows show a
perfect strike. Cost is about £1
per acre, less than the price of
half a ton of cane.
Lucerne Flea.
“Gumeraka”: Conditions will
be less favorable for hatching
fleas if lucerne pastures are kept
bare before opening summer,
rains. Stimulation of grass
among the lucerne ipi autumn
will also reduce egg-laying, and
keeping pastures bare during
part of summer will reduce the
number of eggs which survive.
Although this is against the
principles of good management,
if carried out no permanent
damage will be done to the
lucerne.
Contact-sprays, such as lime
sulphur, are worth trying. Lime
sulphur is not poisonous to
stock, but its application must
be properly timed to kill fleas
after a population has hatched
out and before they begin egg-
laying. It is essential to remove
all pasture growth by mowing
or otherwise before spraying.
Apply spray at the rate of Igal.
of lime sulphur to every 50-
60gal. of water. A spreading
agent, such as calcium caseinate,
is useful. Warm conditions
should be chosen for spraying.
Prevent fleas from entering from
untreated areas by mowing
round sprayed areas or by
ploughing a strip between them.
Fruit-trees.
“E. 2”: This n.-e. Victorian
district was originally a goldfield,
and there are dotted about the
remains of settlements with still
hale and hearty fruit-trees. They
have had no pruning or atten-
tion for 40 years, and the supply
of humus in the rich black soil
or river- and creek-flats is well
up to requirements. Except in
odd years, plums, walnuts and
cherries have their full share of
diseases, and the pome varieties
are riddled with codlin-moth.
The trees manage to thrive de-
spite their setbacks, though the
crops are generally poor.
In contrast, well-kept local
orchards of good age that are
“ Strawb’s gone dry—what can you do about it ?”
sprayed and pruned regularly
have loads of sound fruit. Rain-
fall here is adequate, and arti-
ficial manuring is rarely prac-
tised, the orchards carrying grass
most of the year. This may
possibly support the theory on
artificial fertilisers (B. 10/3/’4B),
but definitely better results are
had from correct spraying, con-
trol of insect pests and pruning.
Selection of the best varieties
suited to local climatic conditions
pays the highest dividends;
exotic and unthrifty kinds aren’t
worth garden space. We grow
fine Briggs Early May peaches
here, but nectarines and other
peach varieties went west in a
couple of seasons with curly-leaf.
Bloat.
“Myrrhee”: Symptoms ap-
pear suddenly, the animal often
continuing to graze until dis-
comfort is obvious. First set
about removing the gases by
forcibly exercising the sufferer
and kneading the distended parts
with the clenched fist to cause
belching. A woodejj gag placed
in and across the mouth will
assist.
In advanced cases use trocar
and cannula. Clip the hair over
the highest point of the left flank
and apply a disinfectant such as
tincture of iodine. Insert the
instrument downward and for-
ward with enough force to pene-
trate both abdominal wall and
the wall of the paunch in one
operation. Then, holding the
cannula in position, withdraw
the trocar to allow the gases to
escape. In mild cases treat with
medicine, using any one of the
following: sodium hyposulphite,
2oz. to soz. in one pint of
water; or two drams of forma-
lin in one pint of water; or a
mixture of 2oz. of pure turpen-
tine with 15 to 20 drops of oil
of peppermint in one pint of
raw linseed oil.
Fodder-conservation.
“Agric”: Two balers operated
by farm-machinery pools organ-
ised through the Darling Downs
Co-op. Dairy Association, Ltd.,
have baled over 10,000 tons of
hay since the beginning of the
year. Each unit comprises a
hay - baler, ensilage - harvester,
plough, scoops and tractors, and
the experiment has been so suc-
cessful that a third unit is being
organised. It has been suggested
that the Queensland Govern-
ment should use for this work
some of the £70,000 grant being
made available annually by the
Federal Government to encour-
age production in the dairying
industry, and there would appear
to be no better use to which
some of this money could be
put.
Harrowing Pastures.
“Dub”: Light surface-harrow-
ing will spread animal manure
evenly over the paddock. This
is most desirable, as evidenced
by the very uneven growth fol-
lowing grazing on paddocks that
are not harrowed. Undisturbed
droppings result in rank, un-
palatable growth, and often in
bare spaces which provide a bed
for weed seeds.
Drastic harrowing with har-
rows built to penetrate into the
soil may do more harm than
good, since it is liable to destroy
many useful plants and to leave
spaces in which many 'undesir-
able ones may establish them-
selves. Drastic harrowing of a
really poor, played-out pasture
will often result in its improve-
ment, but such a pasture should
be ploughed, anyway. .
A pasture in fair condition
may be much improved through
severe harrowing, provided it is
later surface-sown with a suit-
able seed mixture and top-
dressed. For example, a pas-
palum pasture which has become
sod-bound benefits considerably
from deep harrowing.
Pens for Ducks.
“T.F.”: Table ducks are a
better proposition than cockerels,
now that prices of feed and
cartage are soaring, with no
appreciable rise in returns.
Green feed helps to spin out
the ration, and a load of mangels
dumped in the pens will soon be
eaten; sweet potatoes are a
cheap fattening food.
Planning the breeding-pens
will save time and result in
greater fertility of eggs. A good
system is to divide the pen into
two parts, with the shed as the
division ; across the centre of the
shed lay a row of nesting-boxes
with no bottoms and only one
end, which is movable. Stretch
netting above the boxes to divide
the shed.
The ducks readily enter the
boxes to lay, and as they start
to sit the closed end of the nest
can be moved, to block the other
entrance, thus shutting them off
from the drakes. They can be
fed alone, and sit more quietly
without the over-ardent drakes,
which often break eggs. When
the young hatch they are already
in the nursery, and need not be
moved for several weeks.
Molasses for Stock.
We found it simple
in a drought in Charleville
(Q.). Employing the salt troughs,
which sheep were in the habit
of using, we mixed the molasses
with salt, one of molasses to
three of salt, and after the first
day sheep rushed it.
About 3000 sheep were in the
paddock, and after 12 months’
feeding on mulga and three
months of the last of the
drought on molasses a muster
was; made and only 200 sheep
were dead. Molasses was only
30s. per bowser. It pays because
it acts as a mild laxative, which
is necessary in times when sheep
or cattle are fed on scrub, as all
scrubs are binding.
Stopping Erosion.
“Bogan Joe”: In Oklahoma

HAIR RESTORER
"LEAVE THE KNIFE
ENCASED IN COBWEBS."
Mr. E. L. Hudson, of
Neenah Park, Longreach
(Q.) writes on the 29th
March:—•
Dear Sirs,
Having noticed your advertise-
ment in the Longreach Leader
and a supporting report of Mr.
D. M. Archer, of “Strath-
darr,” I feel this gentleman
has not fully dealt on a most
important and successful re-
sult of Elastration.
I have made a careful study
as to results of Elastration and
strongly support your claims
as being advantageous over
any type of lamb-marking
knife, primarily because it is
a means of keeping fly strike
at a minimum and also
"mothering up” difficulties are
overcome considerably through
the lamb suffering little or no
shock and loss of blood.
I could go on and name
many other supporting
points, but I will deal
with the important point
noticed particularly. For
many years there has
been trouble with tail fly-
strike in sheep; this, I
consider, has been caused
mainly by fly blowing in
the scars at the base or
butt end of the docked
tail, resulting from lamb-
marking by knife. The re-
sults of Elastration on
the tail have shown no
scars whatever, and
simply a nice clean bare
area, as recommended by
the C.S.I.R. in perform-
ing properly the mule’s
operation; this is an im-
portant point to be ap-
preciated by those who
have arrived at the same
conclusion concerning tail
strike.
I have wholly marked lambs
from a few weeks old up to
2J months with the Elastrator,
and have achieved 100% re-
sults, and I don’t mean 99.9%.
In future 1 will leave the knife
encased in cobwebs.
UNAFFECTED BY
BAD WEATHER.
Mr. Massy-Greene, of
Berwick, Victoria, de-
liberately chose a bitterly
cold, wet day for a test,
and reported:
“On inspection the following
day, all lambs appeared quite
normal, and up to the present
moment of writing (six' days
since operation) there has not
been a single loss, and to all
outward appearances there has
been no visible setback.
"I would venture to say that
seldom, if ever, have lambs
been marked under such ad-
verse weather conditions, with
such outstanding results: in-
deed, one would never consider
marking lambs with the knife J
on such a day." /%.

Soil is tested and the right type
and quantity of fertiliser ascer-
tained and used to build up fer-
tility. A mixture of summer- and
winter-grass seed is then sown
and the whole covered with
grass hay. Paddocks being
treated are usually spelled to
provide a good growth of
natural grasses. Depth of hay
required is about 6in. to stop
washing and protect the seed.
Where washes are extra deep
cornstalks, brush or scrub will
whilst just above such a
deep wash a line of fence-posts
can be set and a big bulk of
hay stacked behind them. When
the water slows against this pile
it drops its silt just where it is
wanted. Experience has shown
that the gullies so treated could
be grazed the next year, but it
has been found advisable in bad
cases to topdress with hay the
second year in the worst spots
and in some extra bad places the
third year. The whole idea is to
slow the pace of the water.
Flowering Shrubs.
“Sarina”; The old-fashioned
single and double red hibiscus
shrubs are plentiful in east-coast
gardens, but the other varieties
are not grown to any extent.
Nobody thinking of planting
hardy shrubs for ground decora-
tion should overlook Peach
Blow and Island Empress, two
fine pink doubles in hibiscus.
For a single pink Rose Scott is
the best, Conqueror is yellow
and Wilder’s White is white with
red pistils. Cooped is an attrac-
tive variety, Andersonii a splen-
did dark red.
Buy rooted plants from a good
seedsman, who, on request, will
furnish names and particulars
of other worthy varieties. They
may be planted in autumn or
spring, but in cool districts it
pays to plant only in the spring.
If the locality is subject to heavy
winds plant the shrubs in a
sheltered place. Generally, the
more water they get the more
they flower.
Hints for the Farm.
“Big Billy”; A method of
assessing potato yield is to count
the marketable spuds per root
and call it tons per acre, assum-
ing that the average tuber weighs
about 3oz. On the basis that
there are 30 rows of potatoes to
the chain and a spacing of 20in.
between plants and none miss-
ing, there will be 11,880 plants
to the acre. With five per cent,
missing, this would be reduced to
10,000. If every plant yielded
lib. per root the yield would
equal 4Jr tons per acre. With
18in. spacing the yield would be
five to six tons.
“Johnno”: A cheap and effi-
cient paint for farm purposes is
made thus: To a gallon of soft,
hot water add 41b. of sulphate
of zinc (crude). Let it dissolve
perfectly and a sediment will
settle on the bottom. Pour the
clear solution into another con-
tainer. To a gallon of paint
(lead and oil) mix a gallon of
the compound. Slowly stir for
10 or 15 minutes and paint and
compound will be thoroughly
combined. If too thick, thin
with turpentine.
“Sarina”: A recent C.S.I.R.
bulletin reports that diamethyl
phthalate, an odorless non-irra-
tating chemical, is the best mos-
quito repellent under severe cli-
matic conditions. In tests its use
on fabrics was found to keep
mosquitoes away for two or
three days. D.D.T. treatment of
fabrics gave less satisfactory ‘ re-
sults. Other vegetable oils were
highly repellent, but possessed
the disadvantages of smelling un-
pleasantly and irritating the
skin.
“Sundowner”: Because the
capacity of many types of table-
spoons varies considerably, for
accurate measurement of liquids
only a properly-graduated mea-
suring-phial should be used. Of
three similar spoons recently
exarbined one was found to hold
five-eighths fluid ounce, one five-
sevenths and the third , five-
sixths. If recommended spraying
materials are used too strongly
they may cause damage, apart
from the waste incurred. More-
over, they may be completely
useless if used in too weak a
concentration.
“Ben Acre”: If water gets
into the fuel tank drain out all
fuel and water and pour into the
tank one or two cups of methy-
lated spirits. This will mix with
the water, and when the tank is
refilled all will mix. In this
way the water goes through the
engine without interfering with
performance. j
“Myrr”: Put the broody in a
coop or a spare pen without
nests immediately she’s detected.
If she’s allowed to remain on
the nest she’ll be the cause of a
lot of broken, cracked and dirty
eggs, and will be much longer
out of production. Mark the
persistent broody with a distinc-
tive leg-band for early culling.
“W. Court”: No matter how
rich the land has been made
with farmyard manures prior to
transplanting cabbage, cauli-
flower or similar vegetable seed-
lings, work a handful of meat-
works fertiliser into each hole
just before transplanting. The
seedlings will get going very
quickly and won’t need so much
shading.

that a bachelor had been claiming tax
deductions on his neighbor’s wife and
children.”
Now that obstetrical events
Are blessed in a double sense,
You’ll notice in his hour of trial
That the impending father’s dial
No longer bears a haggard stare.
But wears instead the thoughtful
air
Of one who does with satisfac-
tion
A mental problem in subtraction.
But finding that a stranger could
Usurp the joys of fatherhood
Upon the economic plane,
A bloke is bound to entertain
Suspicions of a darker hue ;
And these would certainly be due
To just the sort of misconstruc-
tion
That’s placed upon a wrong de-
duction.
P. M. LUSK.
Devoirs to Demos.
“The results of the elections
in our New Democracy of
Czechoslovakia,” declared the
Communist Premier, M, Gotl-
wald, “came, I might say, as
rather a surprise to me. I
thought the Government would
have had a harder fight to get
back. It just shows in what deep
affection our Communist regime
is held by the great mass of the
people. Why, my own just-
expressed anxiety as to the Gov-
ernment’s fate seems to demon-
strate the true democratic work-
ing of our electoral system.”
“But no candidates other than
those in the Communist bloc
were allowed to nominate, were
they?” asked the Foreign Corre-
spondent.
“That’s exactly what makes it
so utterly democratic!” ex-
claimed M. Gottwald. “In
tyrannies like the British Com-
monwealth unsuccessful candi-
dates who fail to poll sufficient
primary votes brutally have
filched from them the deposit
they were dictatorially compelled
to put up at nomination. Think
of the number of grateful candi-
dates whom we have saved the
equivalent of twenty-five pounds
each!
“It is altogether wrong,” the
Premier went on, “to infer that
simply because only Communist
candidates were allowed the
people were denied adequate ex-
pression of opinion. They were
perfectly at liberty to register
disapproval of the Government
by using the blank slips demo-
cratically provided for the pur-
pose.”
“But,” put in the F.C.,
"Well, it saves you bring pyjames."
“weren’t those desirous of thus
registering disapproval com-
pelled to put the slips in a special
box presided over by the secret
police?”
“Of course. That provision
is the very essence of true demo-
cratic working. Secret ballot,
secret police—what is a more
logical combination? Moreover,
the voter who thus elected to dis-
play his displeasure with the
Government had as his only
obligation to have the size of his
left ankle measured—this was
purely for data purposes for our
prosperous ball-and-chain in-
dustry.”
“But was it very democratic
to dismiss the poll-clerks during
counting of the votes and re-
place them with Communist-
party members?”
“Most certainly! In their
eagerness to please the Govern-
ment some of the clerks may
have been tempted to declare
that more people voted for it
than actually was the case.
Above all we aimed at giving
nothing but a truthful reflection
of the electors’ choice. Com-
munist-party vote-counters, cele-
brated for their impartiality and
strict probity, assured that no
fantastic claim would be made
by my Government that one
hundred per cent, of the people
were behind it—actually the
figures run out at something
slightly under ninety-nine per
cent. You see, we religiously
allow a minority its right of self-
expression, so long as it doesn't
run counter to the Government.
“And what of the great piles
of blank slips which neutral
observers claim were carted
away and dumped before they
could be counted?”
“That,” explained M. Golt-
wald, “was a democratic attempt,
and a humane one so typical of
Communist regimes everywhere,
to save the poll-clerks from ex-
cessive eye-strain.”
“But what of the entire
absence of any pre-election
speeches either on the streets or
over the radio, or article in the
press, in opposition to the Gov-
ernment view?”
“That is a feature,” said the
Premier, “which frankly has had
me puzzled. Our factory ‘action
committees,’ armed of course
purely for self-defence, had de-
finite instructions to allow any-
body complete liberty to get up
and criticise democratically any-
thing except the Communist
regime or any member of it.
Except that it was unfortunately
found necessary to shoot a few
anti-democratic traitors who
failed to see in M. Stalin the
true apostle of democratic
liberty that he is, nothing un-
toward marred the perfect free-
dom of expression enjoyed by
anyone in the country.”
“But what about the fact, of
which everyone in Prague is talk-
ing, that those who dared to
express their disapproval of the
Government by submitting
blank slips were on the morning
after the election picked up by
the secret police and are now
on their way to Russia?”
A look of almost holy en-
thusiasm lit up the sombre
features of M. Gottwald. “That,”
he said, “is an admirable ex-
ample of the best working of
democratic processes. After all,
can any of the so-called Western
Democracies boast of being so
generous to their political
opponents that they even pro-
vide for them, gratis, an ex-
tended holiday in a neighboring
friendly country?”
“The fact that the Communist
bloc of candidates just barely
scraped in by majorities of
around ninety-nine to one over
non-existent opposition must be
almost regarded then as a
miracle,” sarcastically remarked
the Foreign Correspondent.
“That’s it!” exclaimed M.
Gottwald eagerly. “It is a
miracle. It must,” he added
piously, his head bent in rever-
ence, “have been the will of
Marx!”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

4§d. per line; all others 2£dL per line.
Petrol-rationing
So the petrol ration of business and
private motorists is to be reviewed once
again.
On the one hand we have a completely
cynical and materialistic Government
granting its members each 300 gallons of
precious juice to fight an unnecessary
referendum, and, oh the other, farmers
and businessmen starved of the means of
carrying on their essential work.
I’m a country chemist, and I deliver
urgent medicine at any hour, day or night.
My petrol allowance, 13 gallons per
month. The allowance of one politician
would keep me going for nearly two years.
The excuse this time is the war in Pales-
tine. But why bring petrol from the
Middle East when British North Borneo
and the N.E.I. are thousands of miles
closer and in a sterling area as well?
It looks as though the only hope of re-
lief from petrol-rationing in Australia is
for a thumping gusher to be struck at
Rolleston (Q.), and even then the present
Labor crowd would control it to a trickle
in the hope of keeping rationing officials
in jobs for life. - Country Chemist (Q.)*
Labor Shortages
It is surprising how little many em-
ployers do to obtain or hang on to their
labor. For the last 15 months my wife
and I have been doing a working tour
of Australia; we have? been in every
State, and have been willing to tackle
almost any job.
We first tried for grape-picking in the
Mildura district, but although we wrote
to the Commonwealth Employment Ser-
vice a month before the harvest started,
and visited it in Melbourne when
growers were calling desperately for hun-
dreds of pickers because the rain was
spoiling their fruit, not one grower could
be found who could or would accom-
modate a married couple. We moved
on to Adelaide, sent a telegram in answer
to a newspaper advertisement, and a
few hours later were engaged per tele-
phone by a grower on the Murray.
After the harvest we crossed to W.A.
We found it difficult to get work in Perth,
so went to the south-west, where we
tried for jobs as apple-pickers, hotel,
domestics, hospital domestics and mill-
workers, all without success. The man-
ager of a vineyard in the foothills of the
Darling Range offered us a job with the
pruners, but as no huts were on the
property, and no one near the place could
board us, we had to give that a miss.
I next tried the higher-appointments
section of the C.E.S., and it quickly
found me a job as a draughtsman (my
usual work). We were lucky enough to
get good hoard (after examining some
frightful places, and living for a couple
of days in a damp house with T. 8.-
afflicted inmates), and my wife got a
job in a factory. Although this factory
was sorely ,in need of labor all the time,
they apparently made no effort to
modernise the place—their effort to hold
what workers they had consisted of a
wireless programme daily blaring out
above the noise of the old-fashioned
machinery.
We went north to Darwin. Here there
was plenty of work, but accommodation
available for single men only, except
at the hotels, one of which charges 10
guineas a week, and the others five
guineas. We went back through The
Centre to Adelaide.
The Emergency Housekeeper Service
of S.A. was advertising for domestic help,
and gave us the name and address of
a man whose wife was very ill, and who
desperately wanted a housekeeper. The
E.H.S. advertised the pay «as £3 10s. a
week plus keep, but our prospective em-
ployer started to work out payment on
the basis of £3 10s. minus keep. We
didn’t want that so he didn’t want us.
We got a job on a S.A. grain-farm, my
wife in the house and myself bag-sewing.
My wife started at 7 a.m. and finished
at 8 p.m. —not working all the time, but
having to hang about in case she was
wanted. We had a dirty room crowded
with rubbish. I was pak( 16s. Bd. per
100 bags —up to £2 per 100 was being
paid in nearby districts. At meals the
family ate home-made ice-cream, and
oranges between meals, without offering
us any. For Sunday tea we had soup
and bread and jam, although there were
plenty of cakes and biscuits in tins on
the shelves.
We next worked in a private hospital.
We started in December, and worked
Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New
Year’s Day without extra pay, and when
the 40-hour week was introduced I still
worked 52 and my wife 44 without any
overtime pay. On the two days each
week that we had' our “afternoon off”
we worked six hours.
In Queensland we read in the daily
paper that hundreds more workers were
needed on the peanut fields. We went
to the C.E.S. and were told that we
would have to go to the fields and take
a chance of a job and accommodation.
It’s hard to reconcile these facts with
the labor shortage. I know the shortage
can’t be ‘relieved by one employer gain-
ing labor at the expense of another, but
I do think that many employers of
seasonal labor would find it easier to get
workers if they provided accommodation
for married couples as well as for single
men and women. While houses are so
scarce many couples would be glad of
the chance of weeks or months together.
It can be done. S.A. vinegrowers do it,
and in Tasmania the small fruitgrowers
and hopgrowers have been doing it for
many years.— Taswegian (Tas.).
Ex-Army Vehicles
Civilian eyes were opened by many of
the extra-special gadgets—made available
from Army disposals, and I for one have
wondered why on earth it needed a war
to give us the use of some of them. Four-
*Isn't he ruthless, darling? Just like Humphrey Bogart !”
by-fours, blitz-buggies, jeeps, power-
winches, ’ air - compressors, portable
welders, water-pumps —the list is chock-
ful of 'first-rate material for all contrac-
tors and timber-men, builders, farmers,
road-ifiakers, surveyors and others.
Perhaps the king-pin of the lot
is a weird* vehicle known vaguely as a
“scout-car” or “quad.” This contraption
was fitted with pretty well everything but
radar, and looked like a cross between
a bull-bitch and a General Grant tank.
Here, in Westralia’s timber country
they have been put to excellent purpose.
We have a factory processing the wandoo,
or white-gum, into tannin, which is ex-
ported all over the world. Some 10 or
12 years ago bringing in logs was a
problem, and considerable money was
spent on large tractors and so forth,
equipped with winch-gear to lift logs on
to trucks.
The “quad” solved three problems. The
body was stripped off and on the bare
chassis a triangular crane was erected,
with steel girders and braces. The im-
mensely powerful winch, driven by a
separate differential-gear mounted on top
of the quad’s drive-shaft at rear, was in-
corporated in the crane structure simply
by reeving the steel cable through a block
at the top of the crane. Thus you had
a fast mobile lifting-unit that could swing
half-ton logs up like pencils and dump
them on the truck from any reasonable
distance, and pace the truck home into
the bargain.
With four-wheel drive, flexible gear-
range from tractor-creep to 40 miles an
hour, and a 90-horsepower crane, they
represent the last word in log-loading. —
R. H. G. (W.A.).
Television
Television in England is ahead of that
in the U.S.A., and no one who has seen
it will deny its entertainment value-
no one who has been a “looker-in” is
willing to return to being a mere
listener. And engineers and scientists
agree that it has reached satisfabtory
technical efficiency.
The new camera, first used at the wed-
ding of Princess Elizabeth, is generally
better than an ordinary movie camera,
for it has a greater depth of focus, and
does not need Kleig lights or flares of
any kind. With the latest type of cathode-
ray tube the old days of darkened rooms
to assist vision are also gone. If a reflec-
tor-screen is used entertainment can be
given to at least 100 people with an
ordinary receiver.
Opponents of television in Australia
maintain that the cost of programmes
would be too much for the small popu-
lation that would be within listening- and
looking-in range, and that its introduc-
tion would mean heavy losses in capital
equipment for radio-receiver manufac-
turers. The second argument has no
merit whatsoever —people will soon stop
buying radio-receivers, as the essential
parts have changed but little over the last
10 years, and sets are not now being
turned over so quickly.
The first argument has' some merit.
Perhaps the answer lies in giving televi-
sion a part commercial and a part non-
commercial franchise so that advertisers
could bear part of the cost of providing
the films and other material, particularly
live shows and minute-to-minute news
reviews.— Emmie (N.S.W.).
Soldier-settlement
Like the “Labor”-governed States east
of it, S.A. is having its troubles with
soldier-settlembnt, but there the resem-
blance ends. S.A. has nothing like the
amount of good farming land possessed
by N.S.W. and Queensland, nor has it a
Government which, every time it is
twitted about soldier-settlement, passes the
buck to Canberra.
The S.A. Premier, having a hard job
trying to get the Canberra Government
to push soldier-settlement along, declared
that he was “not happy” at the way the
agreement between States and Common-
weath is working out.
The weakness of the plan arises in de-
lays which occur through dual control.
Particularly is that so in obtaining approval
for proposals submitted, and because of an
apparent lack of realisation by some Federal
officers of the fact that if sufficient land
is to be procured in this State it must
embrace large areas upon which heavy de-
velopmental expenditure is imperative.
S.A. has 1800 ex-servicemen on its
books for land. About 1000 have been
classified as suitable settlers when
experienced. “Almost without excep-
tion,” remarked the Premier, “they are
of a remarkably fine type and should
prove capable settlers.” The State now
has 300,000 acres available, is consider-
ing another 400,000 in the south-east and
250,000 on Kangaroo Island.
Of 75 properties (365,000 acres) sub-
mitted to Canberra for approval, only 50
(163,000) have been approved Over two
years ago the settlement of 300,000 acres
on Kangaroo Island was referred to the
Land Settlement Committee. The Com-
mittee recommended that 70,000 should be
developed. That was four months ago.
We are still awaiting approval.
S.A. has bought heavy equipment for
clearing and other work, and it proposes
to get on with it, “irrespective of whether
the Commonwealth accepts it or not.”
There was similar trouble over a settle-
ment scheme at Loxton ; but when the
Premier announced that it would go(
ahead as a State project Canberra almost
fell over itself to grant approval. Which
goes to show that Canberra can be forced
to act. —C. S. (S.A.).
Free Medicine
Last week I had a foretaste of free
medicine, I had previously consulted a
specialist who, with two other doctors,
agreed on a certain diagnosis. A small
operation was considered necessary, and
I phoned the specialist and arranged for
it to be done at the outpatients’ clinic of
a Government free hospital.
When the day arrived I found myself a
tired member of a jostling queue before
an inquiry desk presided over by a
lackadaisical female. From there I went
to a waiting-room containing about 60
people, all waiting to see the same special-
ist. Central heating combined with the
closeness of the crowded room was almost
unendurable, and several hours passed be-
fore I slipped into the specialist’s consult-
ing-room, sat down and became an inter-
ested spectator.
Mussolini was not in it. The specialist
was dismissing those patients with the
utmost authority and speed at his com-
mand, At last I approached him. He
barked a defiant question, I managed a
few words and was then examined, but
how differently from when I was handing
out the guineas at his own private sur-
gery. Finally the medico disagreed flatly
with his own previous diagnosis, and dis-
missed me.
Why can’t our socialists see that the
human element defeats all their precious
scheming?—N. L. B. (Tas.)i
N.G. Natives
“Bickerstaff” (B. 19/5/’4B) is confus-
ing sentiment with practical politics. The
reason why New Guinea natives were
carried as freight is obvious —if they had
been charged for at full rates they would
have had to walk. A great deal of rubbish
has been written about lack of seats and
safety-belts for these native travellers
without anyone explaining how a safety-
belt would prevent a plane from burst-
ing into flames upon crashing.
Before the war I, and hundreds of
other Territorians, travelled in transport
planes over New Guinea jungles, sitting
on our gear without benefit of safety-
belts dr seats and accompanied by natives
and their bits and pieces. We were glad
to do this when the alternative was
“padding the hoof.” The only distinc-
tion made by the air companies was that
whereas we paid full fares, the natives
were weighed and charged for at 3d. or
4d. a pound.
During the war each New Guinea
native acted according to his own lights.
The majority behaved as loyal British
subjects should. Some, however, were
treacherous. But few of them today will
lose any sleep over the fact that some
official in the Brisbane Department of
Civil Aviation calls them “niggers.” That
is a term seldom heard in N.G., anyhow.
Like that other abomination, “boong,”
it is an Australian invention.—J. T.
(N.S.W.).
Eggs
“Emel” (B. 12/5/’4B) asks “What sort
of eggs do people supply to get such
poor market results?”
Some years ago I was with a large firm
which bought henfruit from all over S.A.
and repacked them for export. Many of
the consignors were careless, country
storekeepers being the chief offenders. We
often received huge cases of untested
eggs in all stages of putrefaction, from
doubtful to black-rotten. Bad packing was
almost the rule, and the goods frequently
arrived in the condition of an offensive,
insanitary omelette, disgusting to handle
and impossible to “candle.” Many of
the ripest specimens exploded on percus-
sion like stink-bombs, and we kept a
smouldering fire of rubbish going in order
to camouflage the stench of sulphuretted
hydrogen. Incredible, but dinkum.
Conditions have doubtless improved,
but human nature is still the same, and
there are always gamblers who take a
chance instead of taking trouble to ensure
that their consignments arrive in reason-
ably good order and condition. —
Packer (S.A.).
Rabbits
It is amusing to read of farmers blam-
ing the shortage of wire-netting for the
rabbit menace. In past years, when wire-
netting could be obtained in any quan-
tity, many farmers refused to buy it until
they were compelled to.
In rabbit country there have always
been two kinds of farmers —the man who
tries to keep his property free of pests,
keeps his fences in repair, has rabbits
dug out and blackberry bushes and
similar hiding places for them destroyed ;
and the man who never repairs a fence
until his neighbor threatens him with
Court action. The second man allows
rabbits to breed up in the summer so that
he can trap them in the winter and get
big prices fo'r the skins.
Both types of farmers are still, on the
land today, and it is generally the man
who never repaired a fence in his life who
squeals loudest about the shortage of
wire-netting. If by some miracle it were
made available tomorrow he would find
some excuse for not buying it.
Only when qualified trappers are given
a “trapper’s right,” like a “miner’s right,”
which entitles him to trap rabbits on any
property, will the rabbit-farmer be pro-
perly dealt with. —W. P. T. (N.S.W.).

Life is a tangled affair, and far less definable than the lines on one s hand may suggest.
No one can foresee the future; but the wise man prepares for tomorrows uncertainty.
He safeguards the interests of his dependants, by a practical programme of life assurance.
Consider, for instance, the “Perfect Policy” provided by the Australian Metropolitan
Life. This is a policy that combines the benefits of ordinary endowment assurance,
plus the added advantage of liberal compensation in the case of accident or sickness, and
double the amount of assurance in the event of accidental death. Truly, the Perfect
Policy.”
All Metropolitan policies carry annual bonus additions.
