CHIEFLY ABOVE BOOKS.
Some unemployed member of N.S.W.
Parliament might profitably devote a little
attention to Sydney Free Public Library.
In older days the management of this insti-
tution could only be described as scandalous.
No person is supposed - take away books
from the chief or reference branch, any more
than from the British Museum —not “ under
any circumstances’’says the rule; but this rule
never seems to have applied to influential
politicians or to friends of the trustees. One
now-dead politician is asserted to have ‘ ‘ bor-
rowed ” what books lie pleased, and returned
all but 200 or. so ; a former trustee’s little
collection of books is alleged, by persons
who inspected it after his death, to have con-
tained scores of volumes with the Library
stamp ; the Library funds were debited with
subscriptions for trustees’ ‘ ‘ private ” maga-
zines ; and so on.
* * * *
Latterly supervision has improved ; but it
still seems very lax. For example, up to
April, 1896, a valuable standard work,
Adams and Cunningham’s “The Swiss Con-
federation,” was missing from the Library ;
and its place on the shelf was occupied,
according to regulation, by a wooden dummy
labelled “Lent to Mr. -, July, 1894.”
Another important work on the Swiss Con-
stitution was labelled “ Lost by Mr. ”
(the same “ Mr. ”). After students
had been deprived of -the use of the former
volume for apparently nearly two years, it
was replaced—only the other day—by a new
copy; so possibly “Mr. lost “The
Swiss Confederation ” also. If he did, who
paid for the new copy? and is “Mr. ”
going to pay for the volume still missing ?
* * . * *
Again, it has not been uncommon with
readers to enquire at the Library for an
important book and be told it is “Out,” or
“Missing,” or “Lent to the Trustees.” (This,
mind you, is in the Reference Branch, where
uninfluentiaj people are—very properly—not
allowed to take a book out of the building.)
Sometimes the reply is “Gone to the
Binder ” —a reply which appears to have
convenient euphemistic possibilities ; ffince
an inspection last week (31st July, ’96)
showed that over a score of volumes were
marked “ Binder, 27/12/95 ; ” and it is pre-
sumed the Govt. Printing Office is not in
such a state of disorganisation that it takes
seven months to bind a book. On this
head, a comparison of Printing' Office
statistics with Public Library ditto might be
interesting.
» * * *
An enquiry last week for Lecky’s “Demo-
cracy and Liberty ” elicited that it was
“out.” A whole edition of Oliver Wendell
Holmes’s books was also ‘ ‘ out. ” Among the
other books “ out ” last week were McAdam’s
“ Lives of British Statesmen ” ; Brown’s
“Law and Lawyers Gordon’s “School
Electricity” ; Trautwine’s “ Civil Engineers
Pocket-book ” ; Voltaire’s 1 ‘ Visit to Eng-
land ” ; Silverton’s “ London and Provincial
Water Supply”; Colburn’s “Almanac for
3000 Years ” ; Schinelio’s and Hill’s “ Lexi-
con Manuale Grseco-Latinum ” ; Klaproth’s
“Asia Polyglotta ” ; Barrington’s “Familiar
Introduction to Heraldry” ; Morley’s “Life
of Richard Cobden,” vol. ii.; Brannt’s
“Practical Treatise on the Raw Materials
and the Rectification and Distillation of
Alcohol”; Bertillon’s “Instructions Sig-
naletiques pour Identification Anthropomfi-
trique ” and ‘‘ L’ Anthropometrique J udi-
ciaire k Paris en 1889”; “Extramural
Sepulture Report ” ; Chadwick’s “ Interment
in Towns ” ; Richmond’s ‘ ‘ Colours and
Colour-painting as applied to Lithography ”;
“The Parnellite Split”; “The Tenth
Census of the U.S.” ; Digby’s “History of
the Law of Real Properly ” ; Nicol’s “ Sta-
tistics ” ; “United States Immigration and
Emigration”; Keating’s “ History of Ire-
land” ; “ Ethics of Civilisation”; two volumes
of the “Pamphleteer”; and Dowden’s
“ Shakespeare : His Mind and Art.”
It is an intolerable perversion of the uses
and objects of the Free Public Library that
a class of privileged borrow ers should be per-
mitted to deprive the general student and
enquirer of the advantages of important
works such as these—even if they are re-
turned. But some of them are not returned.
The wooden dummies which replace them
are often marked boldly: “Missing.” The
Library dunno where they are, “ Binder ”
and “ Missing ” together totted up last week
about 100 Volumes • where are those volumes
now ?
*.* * *
It may be said, of course, that it is desir-
able that the Trustees should keep acquaint-
ance with books new and old ; and no one
would object to new books being withheld
from issue for a fortnight or so while the
Trustees glanced through them. But there
is no excuse for depriving general readers of
a book like Becky’s “ Democracy and
Liberty ” ior apparently an indefinite period
four months after publication, in order
to give a Trustee or his friend or
his friend’s friend the exclusive ad-
vantage of armchair perusal. It may
be said that it is desirable that extraordinary
privileges should be extended to known
students or specialists. Perhaps it is ; but
the books should never be taken out of the
library building.
* * * *
Or if they are, to meet the exigencies of
some unusual case, then a register open to
inspection by the public should be kept, and
the date of lending a book, name of person
to 'whom lent, date of return (if any), and
reasons for breach of rule should be regu-
larly entered. It will be noted that the
books named above as ‘ ‘ Missing ” are mostly
highly technical and expensive publications.
It is not the plebeian reader who walks off
with the public property : it is the profes-
sional or business person, the person who
finds it more convenient to address a note to
“ My dear ” than to pay a guinea out of
pocket-, and who frequently, it appears, finds
it inconvenient to return his borrowings.
And, in another particular, precaution is
needed. Anybody now may enter the Library
with a bag, fill it with books unobserved,
and walk out unquestioned. That risk is not
taken in other libraries, and it should not be
taken in Sydney when it can be avoided by
making people leave their bags at the door.
* * * *
The Cynicus Publishing Co., of London
(Davidson Bros., Sydney agents), sends The
Bulletin a collection of colored cartoons by
“ Cynicus.” “ Cynicus ”is a young Scotch-
man who, starting from nothing, has won
fame and very fair fortune by dint of hard
work and genius. Five years ago he swooped
down on-a fish-shop in a Drury-lane (Lon-
don) slum, converted it into a studio, and
forced the critics to praise him.' (As he is
blasphemous, and socialistic, and at war with
half the conventions, they didn’t in the
least wish to.) Now, the “first copies” of
his sketch-books sell up to 15 guineas each ;
he is an artist of leisure, able to winter in
Italy and go summer-caravanning in Eng-
HOME, SWEET HOME!
land ; he has been floated into a company ;
and one of the marvels of the Scotch village
he hails from is the class of. sixfcy-or-so
school-children who color the drawings he
sells.
*' * * *
The two specimens of “ Cynicus’s ” art
here given are familiar to but
they are characteristic. There is an economy
of line which you will find in Caldecott or
Phil May or half-a-dozen of the new school,
but there is in addition a power, a meaning,
a value, which, so far as the writer’s imper-
fect knowledge goes, only Hogarth and
Gilray among English, cartoonists have pre-
viousiy reached.
The essential de-
fect of so-called
Art is its defect
of these things.
“Art for Art’s
sake ” is the right
motto, doubtless ;
but, as frequent-
ly applied, it begs
the essential ques-
tion what Art is.
Art isn’t mere
repro duetion :
Nature lives. A
flat copy on canvas
has at best only
technical interest;
and Art isn’t
technique, though
technique is a
part of Art. In
all things living
there is Soul—
a real, vital
CAPITAL AND LABOUR.
Force—and Style alone isn’t Soul or Force.
At best, it is the husk ; the trappings ; the
setting of the gem.
* * * *
This reads as obscurely as an artist’s own
jargoning, but the meaning sought is that a
picture, to be Art even in the painter’s
limited sense, must make the same appeal as
Literature or Music. It must move you,
grip you, thrill you—either intellectually or
emotionally. (The emotional appeal is the
lower of the two, and the intellectual
appeal at its best includes the emo-
tional appeal.) Now, how many pic-
tures are painted before which you can
stand and say “Very pretty!” “Very
clever ! ” —and which straightway you can
pass from and forget utterly ? On a low esti-
mate, millions. And how many can you
stand before, as before Haydon’s canvases in
the Melbourne Gallery, and feel their message
being, as it were, burnt in—to remain whilst
this machine is to you ? Scores ? It is
doubtful.
• • * •
The claque and chatter of artists—there
never were such formalists—has surrounded
the standards of their art with a mist through
which it is hardly possible to see clearly.
But surely the criterion of a perfect picture
should be that of a perfect poem—it should
unite highest conception with highest ex-
pression ; the central idea should be para-
mount over all the intricacies of detail, which
yet should, to the least of them, be necessary
to its development and fulfilment; and the
final effect upon the mind should be an
inspiration, an exaltation, a nerving to strain
on and up for the realisation of the ideal thus
artistically portrayed.
* . * » *
The art of “ Cynicus ” does not by a good
deal reach this desideratum; yet it
has a meaning, an influence, a thought
at the back of it. Its essence is Idea,
not Form ; and the Form is effective
to drive home the Idea, which is sent
flying straight to the gold. There
is something of permanence in it,
coo; it does not deal with passing
moods and follies, but with vital themes
and persisting motives. The cuts
shown have lost much in losing size
and colour ; but enough is left to make
it fairly clear that the lesson of
Capital and Labour ” will stand
good as : long as - Capital and Labour
have a meaning : that “ Home, Sweet
Home ” has a moral (in the limited earthly
sense) almost universal: that, in a word,
you can’t know “ Cynicus ” without getting
stimulation, and suggestion, and maybe
wisdom which attainment is at least an
approximation to the Art we desire and
would adore.
* * *
When a doctor does not run too much
to invective against the rival practitioner,
(and even when he does) he can often
write things worth reading. What fol-
lows (as reported in the Atjst. Medical
Gazette) was 13r. Harhinson , s contribution
to Vic. Med. Association’s recent discussion
of the momentous question : Shall members
snioke at meetings '( (carried in the affirma-
tive for a six-months trial).
Dr. Harbinsoh said : A pipe, cigar, or cigarette,
smoked after meals, ensures rest and repose from
worrying reflections, thus acting undoubtedly in
a salutary manner. At the same time an increased
flow of saliva is produced by the exciting action of
the smoke on the nervous mechanism regulating
the salivary glands. The glands of the stomach,
being reflexly stimulated, pour out an additional
supply of gastric juice, thereby promoting, or at
least facilitating, digestion. Therefore,
For each a smoke I prescribe ; Ter in die et post eib.
It has a slight stimulative action on the nervous
system, an effect which does not appear if the
dose be excessive. This is not followed by any
depressing reaction. Soon the pulse becomes
quickened, and simultaneously there is an increase
in the frequency of the beats of the heart. When
smoked'by those accustomed to its use the leaf is
one of the most valuable sedatives for the restless-
ness of an overworked or worried brain. Some
smokers find it acts as a (“ nerve ”) stimulant to
mental work. In these cases the effect is prob-
ably not due to the nicotine itself, hut to the
stimulation of the sensory nerveS of the mouth.
These reflexly act on the vaso-motor centres, and
they in turn produce dilatation of the vessels of
the brain: the increased circulation in the cere-
brum, which necessarily follows, may prove the
vis a tergo to loosen ideas lying dormant there.
* * ’ * *
Of course (proceeded Dr. Harbinson) there are
individuals who are more Susceptible to the seda-
tive than to the stimulating properties of tobacco.
One of these happy mortals, in the club smoke-
room, suggested the following thoughts Very
delightful, indeed, must be the sensations of a
inan who, after having well dined, lights a cigar,
or meerschaum, and sinks into a cosy easy chair.
Step, gently in a few moments afterwards; enter
into conversation with him if you can. You’ll
find
“ The pipe, with solemn, interposing puff,
Ma es half a sentence at a time enough.”
Ah, what a careless, thoughtless, happy individual
he is. His dreamy languor; permeates you while
you watch. His physiognomy is a study in lazi-
ness. As you contemplate this lucky smoker you
realise that pleasure is good for man, and man for
pleasure made. You envy him while lie poses, first
in one position and then in another. Note his
legs’ abandon, after having been alternately flexed
and extended in every conceivable manner, with
apparently a fresh charm in each new posture.
And now the vest-buttons are tenderly released
from the fond eiiibraces of the button-holes. This
is the attitude par excellence. At last he has
reached the goal of contentment. Ah ! well it is
for him
“ Who, when again lh° night returns,
When again the taper burns,
Can affoid his tube to feed
With the fragruit Indian weed.
Happy thrice, and thrice again—
Happiest he of happy men ! ” r :
But don’t - ah, don’t ask him to move ; to even
revolve his eyes, if he seems not so disposed, will
be an exqui-ite trouble, lie feels offended if you
request him to pass you the-magazine he has just:
let slip from his fingers. He will hand it to you,
no doubt, rather than confess laziness, but lie
seems injured ; you have disturbed his siesta. He
may look obfuscated and obscured in the smoky
clouds, as he idly counts the curling rings. He
may read a novel, provided he commenced it
before the stage of enchantment. He might listen
to orthopaedic notes, as he removes-that foreign
body (the cigar) from the substance of his tongue,
or appreciate the cafe noir which he will sip if he
can manage to raise the cup to his mouth without:
disturbing the pose of his head. . Slowly the
fleecy clouds an- wafted upwards, carrying with
them thelittio worries, troubles, and annoyances of
life, and leaving behind them a sweet sense of
oblivion—“ ’Tis like the river which whoe’er doth
taste forgets his present griefs and sorrows past.
Then, as he builds-' castles in the ascending smoke,
the cigar-end falls from his fingers, his eyelids
droop, he sleeps:! ,
—and proceeds to dream the verses ascribed
to Lord Byron in Hamilton’s Collection. But
lie is happier asleep : so leave him.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest;
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HE ARNE.—Dear Sir,-Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. . .
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured. —J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tam worth, N.S.W.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and w'e certify that it is per-
fectly' and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.” —Signed

59 other leading residents.

Dr. Gibbons
Having completed his New and Centrally-situated
Electrical & Consulting 1 looms
Will be Pleased to Welcome his Friends
and Patients at
137 Elizabeth-street, SYDNEY.
Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely : —Erequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &c.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt oe 6b. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
debil.it y,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “ Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
D Ft. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.
NONE NEED DESPAIR,
as in every case undertaken by Dr. GIBBONS
A Permanent Cure
is absolutely assured.
Dr. GIBBONS uses none but the very purest
remedies, and never, under any circumstances,
prescribes Mercury in any form.
PATIENTS are reminded that their LETTERS
ARE DESTROYED BY FIRE
immediately they have been read and answered,
and that their cases and names will remain a
secret between the Doctor and themselves.

...That is the date of a letter from
F. Williams, Proprietor Dunedin News-
paper Agency, High Street. His Liver
became torpid and inactive, and, like
so many others, he took
WARNER’S
SAFE
CURE
He says:
“ I suffered from general debility, pains
across my back and loins, and indigestion,
which made me weak, languid, and unfit for
business. I began using Warner’s Safe Cure.
The first two bottles seemed to make me feel
worse, but I knew by others’ experience that
this was not unusual when the liver is very
torpid, so I continued. Six bottles restored
me to my former good health, and I can
recommend it with confidence.”
Not a miracle, but Just another cure
brought about by Warner’s Safe Cure.
Do you take it?

BEFORE YOU
T. E A. F!
When you go out shopping, consider, think
of the money in your pocket, and take account
of the many stores whose various attractions
are laid before you. There is A, with temp-
tation in the form of a pretty show ; there is
B, whose wiles are innumerable ; and C,
who says that he is the man for your money ;
and so on, throughout a list as long as
George-street, each smiling dealer has some-
thing to say and to offer.
Please Pause!
Hearken not to the song of the syren, sing
she ever so sweetly ; heed not the voice of
the charmer, charm he never so wisely.
Your pocket’s concerned ; and there are
pirates about. As the poet pertinently puts
it: “ There be land-sharks and water-
sharks,” and it is for you to see that your
dealings are with none of these voracious
monsters. Take warning in time, for it will
be no use when the new taxes come round —
and the tax-gatherer won’t take no for an
answer—for you to plead : There would have
been enough and to spare had I been wise
enough to

HOOSHTAH!
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Don’t you hear the lusty roarin’ of the crazy camel-
cow ?
Ahmed Khan’s a-haulin’ nose-pegs an’ the beast
has got to bow.
Hear him shriek the mandate “ Hooshtah ! ” —
word that is a camel’s “ must
Hooshtah! means: “You cursed beast, you, get
your belly in the dust !
For, by God, we’ve got to load you for the dusty,
hopeless track,
And you’ll go down if we fire you from your hooks
up to your back.
Go down, you blasted, stinkin’ brute; drop on
your thorax pad,
Or we’ll give you samphire firing and with other
woods as bad.
So Hooshtah ! Hooshtah !
Drop your curling nostril and get down upon the
pad,
Hooshtah / Hooshtah !
Or by the Lord that isn’t here we’ll fire your
rump, my lad.
Once we met an Afghan washing of his feet at
Gaudy Rocks,
And my mate with a revolver gave that Afghan
sundry shocks.
Fancy beasts like that a-spoilin’ gracious gnamma-
holes and soaks,
While we whites go sockless for a month—for
such Asiatic blokes !
An’ these stinkin’ Kurrachee-men claim the only
water near,
And when you enter protests they just drop the
silent tear :
So at Gaudy Rocks, when Mr. Nhubby Bhuks
had washed his feet,
My Matey dropped him sudden (after givin’
warning meet) . • ■_
And the bullet —which was conical—said “ Hoosh-
tah ! ” unto Bhuks,
And his countrymen removed him in assorted
kinds of trucks.
So Hooshtah! Hooshtah l
Bhuks washed ’em in the soak,
And my matey’s trigger broke,
And Hooshtah!
I was once dead gone—my oath, yes ! —on a young
North Melb’ne girl,
But she wouldn’t have no tradesmen —an’ my hair
got out o’ curl;
She would only have a toff, she useter say down
at her shop !
And when a clerk came on the beat, I got the
sudden drop.
So I said my heart was broken an’ I up an’ stowed
away
On a West Australian hooker what was leavin’
Hobson’s Bay,
An’ I struck it at Dead Finish ! An’ she’s Mrs.
Lawyer’s-clerk,
An’ they hunt for something eatable from morning
till the dark
To feed three cormorantic kids—themselves they
don’t much count —
An’ I drink no less than Pommer-OY an’ Hidesic
an’ Lay-Mount—
So Hooshtah ! Hooshtah !
I’ve got her by the nose-peg—I can buy a ’ouse
an’ park ;
She’s starvin’ with her clerk, from the dawn until
the dark,
And Hooshtah I
Once when I was with the push at Richmond
Sunday nights,
Larkin’ round the churches, throwin’ stones an’
seein’ sights—
Then the jay what takes the plate around an’
snipes the people’s “trays ”
’Ud leave his prayers now an’ then an’ knock us
gutter-ways.
Now he says, “ Oh, Mr. Dooley, will you join the
choir at tea ?
For the church there’s a collection, an’ a sermon,
an’ a glee.”
Then I pulls a fatty purse out, an’ I shows him
trays an’ quids—
“Narks yer,” says I, “don’t it, matey? You
what used to boot the kids ! ”
He don’t seem to take no notice, but he says—
“ The ’oly fold
Is as stiff as forty crutches—give us some Dead
Finish gold !
We are slaves to God (an’ Dooley—while he’s got
a extry shirt)
If you’d like some pious exercise, why, tread us in
the dirt ! ”
So Hooshtah ! Hooshtah !
When you’ve beans the world can only kiss ; when
you’re broke—oh, can’t it bite !
But I’ve got it strapped alright
And I hold its nose-line tight,

SATURDAY, AUGUST 15, 1896. -
The Privy Council Trouble.
There are now three candidates in the field
for the billet of Australian Judge on the
Judicial Committee of the British Privy
Council— Way, of South Australia, Wil-
liams, of Victoria, and Windeyer, of New
South Wales. So far as present appearances
go, the appointment depends on a scramble
among these three, and the six Governments
of Australia and Tasmania are much agitated
among the conflicting claims of the candi-
dates. And, so far, not one Government—
not even the democratic Kingston Ministry
at Adelaide, nor the Turner Cabinet of Vic-
toria, whose principal characteristics have
hitherto been plain horse-sense and a hatred
of unnecessary frill and gaudiness—has risen
to point out the most important aspect of
the case : that Australia has no use for either
Windeyer, Way nor Williams, nor any
other Australian Judge on the Privy Council,
nor for any Privy Council whatever, and
that the whole business is mere waste and
vanity and useless accumulation of law-costs.
Provincial jealousies are so rampant in Aus-
tralia that every Government is willing and
eager to perpetuate the curse of a foreign
court of appeal, provided it can get its own
nominee appointed thereon. Why there
should be this great desire to grab at the
positionis difficult to understand. Probablyit
hasn’t yet occurred to the public that New
South Wales won’t be enriched by a single
penny if Windeyer is appointed, and if
Williams gets the billet Victoria won’t be
one straw the better for it, and that it
wouldn’t advantage South Australia an iota
if its own Sammy Way sat on the Privy
Council from now till the day of judgment.
♦ * * *
The idea of appointing an Australian Judge
arose from the fact that the Privy Council,
in the main, knows nothing of Australian
law. Therefore, the final court of appeal
for this country is a tribunal which, in very
many cases, is blankly ignorant of the law it
is administering. It is proposed to remedy
this by appointing an Australian Judge to
hear Australian appeals, on the off-chance
that he may know something of the law he
is administering. As each of the seven pro-
vinces, however, has a legal system almost
entirely its own, even the Australian Judge
won’t necessarily know much. If Samuel
Way gets the billet he will doubtless be an
authority on appeals from South Australia, and
on matters specially relating to Westralia,
Victoria, Tasmania, N.S. Wales, Queens-
land, and Maoriland he can’t be any more
useless than any educated layman might be.
Therefore, the improved situation which it is
proposed to bring about seems to be very
little better than the present one, and the
present one is wholly ridiculous, inasmuch
as it often consists of a court which
doesn’t know the law of the case re-
voking the decisions of one that does.
There seems to be absolutely no reason why
any province should contribute towards the
salary of the new Judge, except the one
which he belongs to. The others certainly
receive no advantage from his appointment.
Whether the one to which he belongs receives
any advantage doesn’t appear, but it gets the
honor, if there is any, and possibly that
counts for something.
♦ * * *
This, however, is by no means the most
important aspect of the case. If Way or
Williams or Windeyer is to form a final
Court of Appeal on Australian matters, no
one has yet explained what possible end is
served by his sitting in London instead of in
Australia. His knowledge of Australian law
wouldn’t be improved but rather deteriorated
by sending him 16,000 miles away from the
place where new Australian law is being
made, so as to make it as difficult as possible
for him to keep pace with legal developments.
He would be half the globe removed from the
Courts whose actions he had to revise. Just
now we have the Judge and the cases he
will have to decide both on the spot, and it
is deliberately proposed to send the Judge
to about the farthest-away place on earth,
and send the cases after him, and let them
keep going after him or his successors for
ever, to the great inconvenience of all parties.
If Samuel Way is fit to finally decide an
Australian appeal-case in England, he is
equally fit to decide it here, and the same
logic applies to every other candidate for the
office. The sending of Way to do the work
in England only means that for every appeal
heard there will be about six months’
needless delay; and, perhaps, £5OO or
£lOOO of needless expense ; and vast
injustice, because the poor litigant will,
by the delay and expense, be deprived
of his appeal altogether ; and more misery
and trouble and hope deferred than anyone
can estimate. And the whole business is
just as foolish as if an Australian citizen,
when he wanted his hair cut, had to send the
barber to England, and then go there after
him and have his hair abbreviated in London,
when it might have been done quite as well
by the same man on the spot.
* * * ♦
The stereotyped argument advanced in de-
fence of the present system consists of a
large and gorgeous statement to the effect
that no British subject can be justly deprived
of the privilege of carrying his appeal to the
highest court of the Empire. This vast and
pompous remark is much less beautiful, how-
ever, than it looks. The British subject is
already debarred from carrying his case to
the highest court of the Empire if it con-
cerns a matter below £5OO in value. That
knocks out about 99 per cent, of civil liti
gants in one act. He is further debarred if
he can’t find security for costs and if he can’t
stand the enormous expense and heart-
breaking delays of the business, and that
shuts the door of the highest court of appeal
to perhaps half the remainder. On a low
estimate, the expense and worry of the
system do actually deprive probably 995
people out of every 1000 of the glorious
privilege aforesaid, and, under these circum-
stance, the wild and whirling observations
about the rights of a British subject are the
veriest drivel. Moreover, the right of every
British subject to carry his case to the
highest court in ‘ Victoria’s dominions is
only another name for the wrong of
every British subject to be dragged
to the farthest ends of the earth in
resisting an unjust claim, and to be perse-
cuted at enormous loss and inconvenience by
any enemy who has money enough to pay
expenses with. And as the great majority
of Privy Council appeals are dismissed it
follows that that institution acts much oftener
(indirectly) as an engine of oppression than
as a means of obtaining justice. Moreover,
even in those cases where it reverses the
decisions of other courts there is no possible
evidence that it is doing justice ; quite as
likely as not it is committing a mistake and
doing a gross wrong, therefore its value is
wholly problematical. In any case, if it is a
valuable privilege to have the right of appeal
to the highest court in the empire, and Way
or Williams or Windeyer is to be that
court, or a part of it, then either of them
might as well be that court in Australia as
in England. And if there is any special
advantage to a grovelling community in the
right to carry its case to an Imperial tribunal,
then let Way or either of the other men be
the same Imperial tribunal in Australia as
he would be in London, and wear the same
scarlet clothes with balloon sleeves, or what-
ever they are, and call himself by the same
title, whatever it may be, and the thing is
done.
* * * *
What is really wanted is not more law, or
law that is more mathematically accurate, or
that can split a hair to a greater nicety ; it is
law that is cheap, prompt and accessible.
The civil law, as it now stands, admits the
possibility ©f four or five successive trials or
appeals in Australia and a final appeal to the
British Privy Council in addition. The Kil-
patrick case, which has dragged its slow
length along in Melbourne for over two
years, is a recent and conspicuous evidence
of this state of things. The law asserts that
it prolongs itself in this dreadful fashion in
its desperate desire to do absolute and com-
plete justice, but it would be much better
for all parties if it distributed justice with
more speed, even if some of the accuracy had
to be sacrificed. When a just verdict for,
say, £5OO is given after all the possibilities
of hearing and re-hearing are exhausted, it
may easily cost the winner £lOOO to win it
and the loser twice that amount to lose it,
and it would have been much cheaper for all
parties save the legal brigade if a hard and
fast line were drawn at one hearing and one
appeal to a local Court. Even if the result of
this limitation were sometimes an unjust ver-
dict, that would almost always be cheaper than
a mathematically just one arrived at under the
present system. Moreover, the policy which
permits of five or six separate hearings does
not by any means make justice any surer ; it
makes nothing surer except costs. A new
trial or an extra appeal is quite as likely to
upset a just verdict as an unjust one, and the
Privy Council probably upsets as many good
decisions as bad ones, and confirms as many
bad decisions as good ones. And if a liti-
gant, who has already, in all probability,
had three hearings, would be grievously
wronged as alleged if he were deprived of a
fourth appeal to the Privy Council, then
he is equally wronged in not having some
court, or some three or four courts, to which
he can appeal after he leaves the Privy
Council. And if it would be a grievance if
his right of appeal ended in an Australian
court, it is an equal grievance that it does
end in a British one, and doesn’t go on to
some other court 10,000 miles away in a new
direction. In short, if it is a grievance that
the right of appeal should end in one place,
it is an equally good grievance that it should
end in any other place, or in any place
whatsoever.
* * * *
Obviously, however, the line must be
drawn somewhere. And it must be a purely
arbitrary line, drawn as a mere matter of
convenience and not as a matter of abstract
justice, for no one knows where abso-
lute justice is located, and if 40 suc-
cessive appeals were allowed it is quite
as probable that the last one would
do a gross injustice by reversing the
just decision which had preceded it as
that it would undo a wrong previously com-
mitted. Therefore, as a matter of expedi-
ence, The Bulletin urges the establishment
of a Federal Australian court of final appeal,
composed of one Judge from each province ;
and the entire abolition of this country’s
connection with the British Privy Council.
An Australian tribunal would be rea-
sonably accessible, which the Privy Council
isn’t. It would be moderately cheap,
which the aforesaid Council never has
been and never can be. It would be
respectably prompt in its decisions, because
it would save the time wasted in humping
the case round the world and back again.
It would know Australian law, which the
present Privy Council doesn’t. Because
the present Privy Council doesn’t know Aus-
tralian law it is proposed to appoint an
Australian Judge upon it to hear Australian
cases, and the same man would hear cases in
the Federal court, so the situation would be
the same—barring the frill and expense and
delay. The costs would go to Australian
lawyers, and the system would make one
absentee the less, and it would do something
to help along the Federal movement, and it
wouldn’t materially damage the “ silken
bonds ” in any way The Bulletin knows of
—the present system of dragging infuriated
litigants at a great expense into English law-
courts probably does the “bonds” a lot
more harm than good. And if Australia
must have a British Privy Council to appeal
to, then this Court can be a British Privy
Council—or a football, or a haggis, or what-
ever other name is wanted. And, against all
this, there is no reason on the other side that
this paper has heard of, nor has it heard of
anybody who has heard of one. The dull
conservatism of the law and lawyers and the
apathy of other people are the only visible
causes why the present system has endured
so long.
“The Burns Myth.”
Dear Bulletin, —Apart from the opinion of
Carlyle and Scotchmen generally, why was not
Burns a great poet per se ? The case does not
stand proved that he is only a great Scotch poet.
Thousands of Lowland Saxons, who hate, Gaelic
like poison, love and admire Burns. And Gaelic
is a sair dose to gulp down, even when strongly
diluted with whisky. The point that all Scottish
poetry is Celtic is, however, true. The Celtic
race, which traces its source back about 1000 years
before Christ to a locality in Turkey, includes the
Gaelic. Brittany, Wales, Isle of Man, Highlands
of Scotland, West of Ireland are its strongholds—
and Ayr was once the seat of one of the earliest
known native rulers of the Celts. Consequently
all Scotchmen are Turks, and that is perhaps why
Burns was so fond of the women.
It is true that Burns produced no great epic, no
classic drama. But does the production of great
epics and classic dramas alone constitute greatness
in poetry ? Sometimes there is greatness in the
poetic atmosphere of the thought, in the note that
runs through the work. Burns was nothing if not
the poet of Democracy, and it is the Democratic
note expressed lyrically that makes him great.
His eternal theme is the dignity of labor, the
brotherhood of man. He is direct, potential,
tender, humorous, stirring the deepest chords. He
was ahead of his time, and we are not abreast of
him yet. Like Heine, but without Heine’s cul-
ture, and far below the German in intellectual
strength, he fought, a brave soldier in the cause of
Humanity.
At his best his thought is robust, world-embrac-
ing, scintillating with wit; his lyrics of the purest;
his fire not surpassed by any poet in the English
and Celtic anthology. In spontaneity he was the
equal of Byron, but with saner, more catholic,
truer insight. Wordsworth was not above him as
a nature poet, nor Shelley as a lyric. In pure
poetic strength and originality, Keats, Shelley,
and even Tennyson are but beautiful children
beside him —weavers of wondrous words, makers
of delicious music, but charged with no electric
message to thrill the hearts of men. ,
* * * *
“No one,” says Laing, in his essay on thecreeds
of great poets, “equals Burns in the keenness of
insight with which he looks through tbe outer
husks and habiliments of things to their real
essence.” Carlyle’s clothes philosophy in “Sartor
Resartus ” is but a sermon on the text :
The rank is but the guinea stamp,
• The man’s the gold for a’ that.
* * *
Of course, Burns wrote an intolerable deal of
trash, but so did Tennyson. And to compare him
to Tupper is enough to make Saint-Beuve turn in
his grave.
Anyhow, how much of the Victorian poetry is
going to live at the end of the twenty-second cen-
tury ? It is only about a thousandth part of what a
poet writes that really lives, becomes incorporated
with the language and crystallised into the thought
of the world. And Burns has just as good, if not
a better, chance than Tennyson, Browning, and
Swinburne. And if (in Matthew Arnold’s words
on Goethe) Burns cannot be said “ to have seen
Life steadily and seen it whole,” he saw with a
piercing vision everything in life that related to
mankind. His intensity, his grasp, and his splen-
did enthusiasm for Humanity—fighting grimly to
a higher goal—make him of more use to the world
than all the cold, universal culture of the Sage of
Weimar.
Perhaps the best words ever said on Burns are
by the English poet, William Watson, himself a
lyric poet not inferior to Keats. I give a few dis-
jointed stanzas from a long poem :
He came when poets had forgot
How rich and strange the human lot;
How warm the tints of Life ; how hot
Are Love and Hate ;
And what makes Truth divine, and what
Makes Manhood great.
For, ’mid an age of dust and dearth,
Once more had bloomed immortal worth.
There, in the strong, splenetic north,
The Spring began—
A mighty mother had brought forth
A mighty man.
And though thrice statelier names decay,
His own can wither not away
While plighted lass and lad shall stray
Among the broom,
Where evening touches glen and brae
With rosy gloom ;
While nations see in holy trance
That vision of the world’s advance,
Which glorified his countenance
When from afar
He hailed the Hope that shot o’er France
Its crimson star ;
While, plumed for flight, the soul deplores
The cage that foils the wing that soars;
And while, through adamantine doors
In dreams flung wide,
We hear resound, on mortal shores,
The immortal tide.
Toowoomba, Q. Anglo-Australian.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Fruit Export Business.
The N.S. Wales Board of Exports, an institu-
tion created by the present Foreign- trade
Ministry, proposes to find a market for N.S. W.
produce in England, and in order to create a
trade it is going to buy and export 3000 cases
of fruit. There are various quaint aspects
about this new departure. New South Wales
is one of the finest fruit countries on earth, yet
at present it hardly grows enough fruit for its
own consumption. Of what it does grow a
large proportion goes to waste, because almost
the only market—Sydney—is flooded, under
the Foreign-trade regime, with immense quan-
tities of imported produce from all manner of
markets, near and far. Somehow, under Free-
trade, the local grower doesn’t contrive to hold
his own even in his own market against the
far-away outlanders. The principles of the
Reid Government don’t permit it to take any
steps to secure the N.S. W. grower control of
his own market, but they do allow it to take
special measures to enable him to scramble for
a market 16,000 miles away. The department
is to buy the fruit and pay railway and sea
freights and all other expenses to London,
and sell the goods there for what they will
fetch. As the grower, in many instances, can’t
get enough for his fruit to pay expenses to
Sydney, let alone to London, the assumption is
that the transaction will be conducted at a
heavy loss, which will be charged to the general
taxation. Therefore, it appears that, though
there is great objection to taxing the people by
Protection in a way which will not only bring
money to the revenue but will secure the
N.S.W. fruit-grower his own market, there is
no objection whatever to taxing them in a way
which will take money out of the revenue, and
will leave the fruit-person as hopelessly unable
to compete in his own market as he was before.
If the experiment proves that England will buy
N.S.W. fruit, then it is assumed that the
N.S.W. grower will proceed to ship it to
London - on his own account, and grow rich on
the trade that will ensue. He will do this,
partly because, under the discouragement of
Freetrade, he doesn’t grow enough to supply
local demands ; and partly because, as he can’t
send it the short distance to Sydney cheaply
enough to oust the far-off outsider and get con-
trol of the Sydney market, the natural thing
to do is to send it 16,000 miles further. The
Freetrade policy is absolutely averse to assist-
ing or subsidising any industry—but that, ap-
parently, only applies to subsidising it in the
local market. So the fruit in question will be
trained to Sydney, and then laboriously humped
to the ship’s-side, past the shops where the Fiji
bananas and the apples, pears, and plums from
Tasmania and Victoria and Maoriland, and
the Italian lemons, and the English jams,
and the dried fruits from ’Murka are for
sale. And then the ship will carry it “ home,”
passing on its way other ships bringing similar
fruit for sale in Sydney. And when N.S.W.
thus exports, say, ,£2OOO worth of fruit a dis-
tance of 16,000 miles, and imports £6OOO worth


of the same sort from other great distances, the
aggregate trade will be swelled by £BOOO, and
heavy remarks will be made about the way
things are looking up under the foreign shoddy
regime. Whereas under Protection it is pro-
bable the £2OOO worth wouldn’t be exported at
the public expense, and the £6OOO wouldn’t be
imported for the local grower would supply the
market, and the country would save the differ-
ence of £4OOO, and the statistics would show
that trade had diminished by £Booo—which
circumstance would clearly prove the decad-
ence which necessarily follows on a Protective
policy.
Seddonism in Maoriland.
The M.L. Government reputation for honest
finance, which hasn’t been in any too good
health of late, has practically gone bung, as
shown by Premier Seddon’s own admissions in
his financial statement. According to the
cynical candour of Richard of Kumara,
Stout’s story about the famous sinking-fund
swindle is all true ; unlike Ward, who shuffled
over the matter and gave evasive answers,
Digger Dick acknowledges it quite cheerfully,
and says the job is still going on, and wants to
know why anybody should object to it. The
sinking-fund matter is an ancient, smellful
affair which is difficult to sort out, therefore
most people let it slide ; the average individual
could understand and applaud when Digger
Dick offered to whirl a superfluous pick and
shovel in the caved-in Brunner mine, but the
obscure ways of finance are beyond him.
Many years ago, when Maoriland was more
sanguine than it is now, it floated loans with a
sinking-fund attached to each —an annual pay-
ment which was to accumulate into a sum large
enough to pay off the debt when it fell due. It did
accumulate for some time. Then Premier Stout
and his hard-up Ministry struck an idea ; the
payments to the sinking-fund couldn’t legally
be suspended, but an Act was passed authorising
the Government to borrow each year and put
into the revenue as much money as was paid
out of the revenue that year for sinking-fund
purposes. This in itself didn’t matter much ;
it merely put Maoriland in the position of
having no sinking-fund at all, which is also the
position of New South Wales, Victoria, and
some other provinces. But the Act, like most
Acts drawn up by lawyers, was a badly-con-
structed and leaky affair, and, instead of speci-
fying that the Government might only borrow
an amount equal to what it actually paid into
the sinking-fund, it gave a large, loose authority
to grab sinking-funds in general. The dodgy
Treasurer Ward saw the weak spot, and when he
was dreadfully hard-up for a surplus he availed
himself of it, and spent the rest of his political
life refusing to furnish information on the sub-
ject. In Maoriland, the central Government
finances for many of the local bodies ; it borrows
money, and re-lends it to them, and the local
bodies make annual payments into a sinking-
fund to liquidate the debt. Treasurer Ward
struck the great idea of borrowing these funds
also, and now, if the general revenue pays, say,
£50,000 into the State sic king-funds and the
local bodies pay £70,000 into their own sinking-
funds in a year, the Government borrows
£120,000 and puts it into the ordinary revenue,
and has a real good time with the proceeds.
Therefore, so far as the £70,000 is concerned,
it amounts to the same as if the Government
borrowed it in London and put it into revenue
at once. The local body has raised, say,
£IOO,OOO from the British money-lender,
through its agent, the Government, and it pays
the loan back by instalments to the Government
as agent for the British money-lender ; and the
Seddon Ministry, to all intents and purposes,
acts as the dishonest trustee in the business,
and annexes the money, and calls it revenue,
and makes the original liability a permanent
addition to the public debt. Seddon stands
fast on the plea that this disgraceful proceeding
is perfectly legal, just as Reid stands on the
legality of the finance which produced his
faked surplus, and in each case the statement is
correct; both matters are legal according to a
foolish and muddled law which the Legislature
passed without realising its meaning, and which
an unscrupulous Minister has taken advantage
of to the uttermost. The political morals of the
average Australasian Treasurer are not up to
much. His main idea is to make a surplus by
any dodge which isn’t distinctly illegal, or by
crawling through any hole which Parliament
has omitted to stop up. And then he sometimes
denies that he has done it, and at other times,
as in the case of Digger Dick, he simply says
that he is going to keep on doing it, and that,
as long as his party-majority stands by him, his
critics may go to Tophet, and that, while the
proceeding is legal, by accident or otherwise,
its political morality doesn’t signify.
The Pleasant Sunday Afternoon and
the Nude Model.
Ed. Bulletin, —The thanks of the community
„re due to last week’s Sydney “ Pleasant Sun-
day Afternoon” meeting. These “Pleasant
Sunday Afternoons,” by the way, are not half
so well patronised as they deserve to be. Pro-
perly viewed, there is no more interesting and
instructive way for “men only ” to spend an
hour and a-half than to come and listen to half-
a-dozen well-selected saints discussing the
social evil, the age of consent, the impropriety
of the nude, and so on. The only place
where I remember to have experienced exactly
the same sensations was in Dupont-street,
San Francisco, where picked specimens of all
the women on the globe—French, English,
Scotch, Negro, Chinese, Jap., German, Russian,
and Mongrel —sit each in her little shop, behind
her little (jrille, and beckon to the strange
voung man after the fashion so graphically
described by our old friend Solomon. Perhaps
the Dupont-street exhibition is more various;
but for real, stimulating, cayenne-peppery
unction the “Pleasant Sunday Afternoon”
is way up top But to return to last
Sunday’s Afternoon, at which forcible re-
ference w'as made to the apathy of Govern-
ments in matters of social purity. While
one member of the Goo-fearing Ministry gets
his red shirt off at a Salvation Army meeting,
and another lay-preaches in the back-blocks on
the necessity for obtaining the Joy, the moral
and artistic sense of the youth of Sydney is
being corrupted by the exhibition of cheap
female models at the Technical College. The
Pleasant Sunday Afternoon was told that on at
least one occasion a model was naked, and
it was rightly declared that this is one of the
things w’hich the Govt, should Put Down.
There is no doubt about it. Contemplation of
the average nude female form is destructive of
all the ideals which the community should
prize. I do not know what the Pleasant Sun-
day meeting’s experience has been, but I have
seen some hundreds of nude females of
all countries and ages, and I assure
you, Mr. Editor, that there was only
one of them worth looking at twice, and
she was a black-gin. More, I assert that
not one woman in ten thousand is fit to be seen
without her clothes on. The average woman is
lop-sided, short-legged, gross-curved, bulgy, and
unshapely ; and the exhibition of her for alleged
artistic purposes should be prohibited by
legislative enactment. I am thoroughly in
accord with the Pleasant Sunday meeting.
If Govt, wishes Technical College pupils to
study the female form, it should procure, not a
chance model hired “ for a few shillings,” but
the very best that money can buy. I would
cheerfully leave her selection from the mass of
candidates to a committee of the whole of
N.S.W. GoD-fearing Ministry, and the same
authority should be empowered to inspect her
from time to time to see that she did not
deteriorate from the high standard which
gentlemen of their attainments would naturally
fix. Thus only can we secure the end which
the Pleasant Sunday Afternoon yearns for, and
save the artistic instincts of our young men
and women from becoming hopelessly depraved.

Sweating the Civil Servant.
G. Read Murphy, a Victorian clerk of
courts, wrote in his own time a pamphlet
for a Melbourne dentist, and, failing to get
his hire, sued the dentist and got a verdict.
Thereupon, owing to pressure from some obscure
quarter, Vic. Law' Department has written to
Murphy telling him he must not do it again,
and drawing his attention—and through him
that of all civil servants —to section 116 of the
Public Service Act, 1890, the marginal note to
which runs—“ No officer in the Public Service
to engage in duties unconnected with his office.”
Right here the Law Department writes itself
down an ass. Murphy made a single contract
and carried it out, and the department on the
strength of that note threatens him. But
the marginal note is not law' at all, and
furthermore, the said note does not correctly
summarise the section, for throughout the
section continuity is implied, the phrases run-
ning “ accept or continue to hold any paid
office,” “engage or continue in the private
practice of any profession,” “ accept or con-
tinue to hold any municipal or corporation
office.” The intention of the section was evi-
dently to prevent the running of a private and
a public business at the same time in such a way
that public business w'ould be interfered with.
Thus a railway stationmaster must not likewise
be a regular grocer or butcher, but he may sell
a bag of flour or half a sheep to the man next
door. And, particularly, it could scarcely be
seriously intended that a civil-servant with
some intellect should not use that intellect for
his own purpose in his own time. Must he leave
his brain behind him daily in the red-tape and
sealing-wax department, and go home imbecile
and vacuous ? And, particularly, must literary
w'ork be forbidden to servants of the State ?
Were such the case, most of Marcus Clarke’s
best fiction w'ould never have seen the light;
A. W. Howitt’s splendid anthropological labors
would have been lost to Australia; so w'ould
George Gordon M'Crae’s verse, and much of
Henry Kendall’s, and Philip J. Holds-
worth’s, and Brunton Stephens’, and Tom
Bracken’s not to mention many inferior
lights. So, too, some of the best leaders
and articles in the Australian press w'ould
have remained unborn in Australia. Take
similarly a few British names Robert
Burns, Charles Lamb, Alfred Austin, Ed-
mund Gosse, Austin Dobson, Anthony Trol-
lope, General Wolseley, Admiral Clements
Markham, and last, and in many w'ays greatest,
Thomas Henry Huxley. Carried out logically,
then Premier Turner, while drawing salary of
office, should not plead in court; Alfred
Deakin should not write for the Age, nor
Murray Smith for the Argus ; laughing Pea-
cock should not legal-manage; nor Percy
Chirnside “squat”; nor Hancock secretary
the Typographical Union ; nor Bromley' japan.
If the State demands every man’s total labor
for a State salary, then M’s.L.A. are the worst
offenders of all. Furthermore, if this be so,
then the State, by demanding 24 hours’ use of
a man’s intellect, is the worst sweater that
could possibly be.
A Bill Drafted by the New Woman.
The Maoriland National Council of Women has
drafted a Bill—which it wants to have rushed
through Parliament at once—for the abolition
of a lot of things. The three crucial clauses are
as follows :
2. Coverture both as to person and property, and all
the incidents thereof, as known and established by law in
the colony of New Zealand, shall be and are hereby
abolished ; and all the laws and customs in force in the
said colony relating to coverture are hereby repealed.
3. From and after the passing of this Act every man and
every woman already married, or who may marry, shall in
all their economic relations be, and be deemed to be, sepa-
rate persons in law and in equity as to all property, means
and estate which shall belong to each before or at mar-
riage, or which either may succeed to, acquire or earn
during marriage ; provided always that every man and
every woman before marriage may enter into such lawful
contracts as they judge suitable to provide for the main-
tenance of the household and the management of their
domestic concerns as freely as if they were entering into
a co-partnership in business.
4. From and after the passing of this Act the wages or
earnings during marriage of every husband and the wages
or earnings during marriage of every wife, subject always
to existing contracts of marriage relating thereto, shall
form a common fund appropriated to the maintenance of
their household and family expenses, and the education
and outfit in life of the children of their marriage, in such
way and manner as the parents may see proper. And in
like manner when only the husband is in receipt of
wages or earnings during marriage that income shall
always form a common fund appropriated as aforesaid.
In either case the wife shall be entitled, if she sees proper
to do so, to require one-half of such wages or earnings to
be paid to herself, or to her credit in a bank, and the
same shall be regarded in law as her own separate wages
or earnings, just as if she were in receipt of the same as
wages or earnings, to be applied, however, equally with
her husband’s share, towards the support of the house-
hold.
Apparently, therefore, the wife is to have a
half-share in the old man’s profits, while he
stands all the losses himself. If he makes
£2OOO in his business one year she gets £IOOO.
If he loses £I2OO next year there is nothing
said about her giving back £6OO, so he stands
the whole racket. Therefore, at the end
of two years she has got £IOOO and
he has £2OO less than nothing. Also, it
seems that all his earnings are to go into a fund
for maintaining the family; there is to be
nothing left to form a reserve-fund in his busi-
ness to prevent it smashing up in some future
period of. disaster. The money is to be set
aside for household expenses and the education,
&c., of the children of their marriage. If one
of them has children by a previous marriage, or
lias a mother or grandmother or affiliation-order,
these latter responsibilities are wholly unpro-
vided for. The old law may compel him to
provide for them, and the new law, if it is ever
passed, sets forth that his cash is to go towards
supporting the household and the present batch
of children only. Altogether, there will be
pleasant times ahead for the old man and his
wife, the new woman, if the scheme of the
Maorilaiul Hen Convention ever gets into work-
ing order, and the two will be like Reid and
M‘Millan slanging each other on the floor of
the House over the budget.
A New Precedent.
Q. Full Court seems to have established a new
criminal precedent. Two men, lately convicted
at Rockhampton, were sentenced to imprison-
ment and floggings, under a section of an Act
that provided no flogging penalty. On appeal,
the Full Court cancelled the floggings, but up-
held the imprisonment. It would be interesting
to know how the British Privy Council (in the
always deplorable absence of an Australian
Final Court of Appeal) would deal with an
appeal from the Full Court’s ruling. Hitherto
the legal system has been that a sentence stands
or falls as a whole, and, like the constitutional
money Bill in an “Upper House,” must either
be rejected or endorsed as a whole, but cannot
be amended. However, this is not the first
time that Q. sentences have been varied, though
it is (so far as the writer knows) the first time
that a Q. Judge’s sentence has been publicly
varied by the Full Court. The celebrated
“Hopeful” prisoners, whose death-sentences
were allegedly commuted by the Executive
to penal servitude for life, with a period “in
irons ” that exceeded the legal sentence
“in irons” possible under the Act, had
those commuted sentences varied quietly
by administrative action. A technical ap-
peal at that time would have raised some
curious points. The present Chief Justice of
Q. was then Prime Minister, and chiefly re-
sponsible for the alleged error. In the light of
ordinary horse-sense, there seems no good
reason why an erroneously inflicted sentence
should not be varied by a Full Court, but the
admission of such desirableness should also
necessarily include the possible variation by
any Full Court of a vindictive sentence —vin-
dictive in the sense of undue severity due to
the state of the sentencing Judge’s mind, or
liver, or bias, or anything to which human in-
firmity is subject. In short, there should be
the same right of appeal in criminal as in civil
cases. Much consideration of these and cog-
nate points generally evolves the conclusion
that the trying jury should not only say whether
an accused is guilty, but how much, in its
opinion, he is guilty.
Ed. Bulletin, —The Freetrade Heaven of Un-
limited Cheapness has fallen on Sydney. A
meal of three courses, three pence ; bed and
breakfast, sixpence; pair of shoes, one-and-
nine ; boots, two-and-six ; trousers, three-and-
three ; full suit, ten-and-nine ; wages for coach-
men and gardeners—when they can get them—
five shillings a week and found ; and an im-
mortal soul for eighteen-pence. What more
can be asked ? Between the storekeepers it is
war to the knife, and the tragedy is none the
less real if the ruined homes of the defeated
are known only to the few. Twenty per cent. —
thirty per cent. —discount is placarded on every
other window ; they serve you butter where
you buy bonnets, candles where they sell spades,
and no man is sure when he goes to buy a shirt
that he will not fall over a box of eggs. The
big firms have crushed, or are crushing
out, the smaller ones, and are now fighting
to a finish amongst themselves. Stand at
the railway - station between eight and nine
in the morning, and notice the crowd that
surges into the city. Ninety per cent, are girls
and boys who are doing their parents’ work at
a quarter the money. The Sydney schools
have emptied themselves into the stores and
warehouses. Where, one would like to know,
are the once familiar thousands of able-bodied
men? The lad at 10s. a week is in brisk
demand in town —he is nearly equal to the man
who once got three pounds, if you know how
to boss him. Sydney folk never were very
genial—there is an aloofness in the city’s social
tone reminiscent of the Gallows Hill days—but
now, every man of business is as hard as a steel
wedge and callous as Nosey Bob. He is
otherwise at his peril; for he hears stories
enough of misfortune in one week to strip
him of a month’s profit if he gave a sign of
innate benevolence. But what matters the
souring of the better part of our
natures, the blight of financial worry that
vanishes the smile from every face ? Have
we not Cheapness, that mighty god whose pants
are made at fourpence-halfpenny and shirt at
five farthings ! Can we not dress in shoddy,
and—for a few days—look respectable ? Is
this cheapness genuine ? Is this rubbish with
its fifty per cent, off for cash as good ultimate
value as an article that might cost, say, three
times the price ? Is the ruin of homes, the
breaking of hearts, no item in the bill of cost;
or are we mere counters for money-sharks to
gamble with, stepping-stones in the evolution
of a race of self-degraded serfs ?—F.
Now that the Seddon Government (Maoriland)
has resolved to float a loan of £1,000,000 —
mostly for works which yield no direct revenue
—its principal organ in the South Island —the
Canterbury Times —takes up the parable and
says that the loan is, on the whole, a good and
noble idea. The same paper supported the
non-borrowing policy in former days when its
particular Government believed in financial in-
dependence ; party politics and party news-
papers are built that way. The question now
remains : Is Seddon to be allowed to go on the
loose as Vogel did, or is he to borrow only
under certain definite restrictions ? If borrow-
ing is an evil that can’t be got rid of it
should be restricted in two ways. One
expedient is to enact by statute that no new
loans shall be floated except for works —such as
railways, telegraphs, telephones, the acquire-
ment of estates for sub-division and the like —
which yield direct revenue. The other is to
enact that borrowing must bear such a propor-
tion to the increase of population that the
interest burden per inhabitant shall be a
steadily decreasing one. As an example : The
interest bill for each Maorilander in ’93 was
£2 7s. sd. per annum. If it had then been
enacted that future borrowings must be calcu-
lated to allow of a reduction of this burden at
the rate of at least 4d. per annum, then the
limit in 1896 would be £2 6s. sd. per inhabit-
ant. If, by increase of population or reduction
of interest, the burden had been diminished to,
say, £2 3s. 5d., then there would be room to
borrow another <£3,000,000 at per cent,
without going over the prescribed limit, if Par-
liament felt so inclined. If there was no such
margin, then there could be no borrowing until
there was one. These two restrictions working
together should do at least a little to alleviate
the borrowing disease.
It is alleged in a number of Victorian papers
that the Outtrim Coal Co. runs a kind of truck-
system of its own which is several times more
accursed than the ordinary variety. The town-
ship of Outtrim, it is said, belongs to a syndi-
cate which is half-brother or something to the
coal co., and no miner gets employment from
the coal co. unless he buys an allotment from
the syndicate to build his house on, and pays
for it at an exorbitant rate. Therefore, the
syndicate is doing good business, and land-
values are going up beautifully. It is further
alleged that David Syme, of the Age, is one of
the syndicators; and, under these circum-
stances the owner of the great Liberal
paper would do well to rise up and
clear his character from this accusa-
tion. If the stories of the Outtrim land
arrangements are true (The Bulletin does not
allege that they are, and hopes to see them
promptly disproved), then a time will pos-
sibly come w’hen it will be found necessary to
sack the miners who have finished paying for
their allotments, in order to make room for new
men who will buy more allotments, and thus
keep the business booming. Or a good trade
could be done by buying back the sacked
miner’s allotment at half cost price, and then
selling it at the old figure to the next man, and
so on ad infinitum. There is hardly any end to
the possibilities of a land co. if it can compel
all the working population to buy its land at
its own figure. If even half the allegations
now floating about are correct, Outtrim badly
wants Parliamentary investigation.
New South Wales Justice-Minister Gould
can’t be more than “ almost persuaded ” of the
desirability of appointing shorthand-writers to
courts of justice, and is even timid about try-
ing them in the Equity Court. They are badly
needed in criminal cases, and even in prelim-
inary police-courts when causes are tried that
may involve a committal to a higher court.
The writer knows of a case now before Quarter
Sessions, in which an accused man, who was
committed for trial, on procuring a copy of the
depositions taken by a country C.P.S., dis-
covered that two statements, one by the prose-
cutor himself, and one by a bank-manager,
which would possibly have compelled the
Attorney-General not to “file a bill,” were
omitted altogether. Yet those two statements
were reported in the local newspaper by a con-
scientious reporter quite uninterested in the
case. And shorthand - writers are needed
in court to keep the Judges straight. Any
barrister who has had much to do with appeals
will understand what that means.

The N.S.W. Government is raving once more
over the question of those Govt, stores which
Premier Reid solemnly alleged to cost more than
twice as much in Victoria as in N.S. Wales.
The latest racket comes in the shape of a report
from the N.S.W. Controller-General of Stores.
It admits that the last report was all wrong,
and then it baldly states that the Victorian
stores cost £17,000 instead of £21,000, and that
Freetrade is still on top, but not nearly so much
on top as it seemed to be before. The present
story rests on exactly the same authority as the
other story, which came to grief. Moreover,
there is still no explanation as to why the return
deals with less than one-tenth of the stores
instead of carrying the comparison right through
—in other words, why it is made up by select-
ing only the few items which support the Reid
case, and suppressing those which don’t support
it, or which tell against it. In the present
return, it is admitted that even the N.S. Wales
figures in the last one weren’t right; in fact, the
muddle seems to get worse as it goes on.
Dear Bulletin, — Re underpaid and over-
worked hospital attendants. The inmate attend-
ants in the N.S.W. Govt, asylums, upon whom
all the work falls, are on duty from 4.36 a.m.
to 8 p.m., for which long hours and unhealthy
employment they do not receive any pay.
Further, the so-called rules and regulations,
with the petty, harassing restrictions now
being put in force, have a peculiarly aggravat-
ing effect on people whose perhaps otherwise
kind dispositions are soured and made irritable
by their own infirmities and troubles. Under
these conditions it is not to be expected that
necessary care and attention can be paid to the
more helpless patients, or that reasonable medi-
cal instructions can be rigidly carried out. It
seems as if the system’s sole aim was to make
the inmate feel his unfortunate position as a
pauper in a poor-house.— An Inmate.

An immense streak of luck, such as even
Bland Holt seldom brought to the old Sydney
Royal, has so far attended Maggie Moore’s
“ Trilby ” burlesque. On an average night every
seat is occupied and the public stands two deep all
round the back of the d. 0., and only extraordinary
gpod fortune will prevent Maggie Moore being
fined (or in default of payment 30 days, and her
hair cut short, and scrub out her own cell) for a
serious case of overcrowding. And the possibility
of Miss Moore scrubbing out her own cell is alto-
gether too painful to contemplate. The reason of
this rush of business is mainly the winsome
Maggie herself, together with Svengaliand Gecko ;
the burlesque, or at least Mr. Finn’s part of it, is
a very small, weak, pale circumstance. All that
that gifted writer has written could be got into
about four sheets of note-paper, or very little
more, unless the scribe wrote laboriously in a very
large hand with his tongue out ; in fact, it is
doubtful if any play ever got through with
less solid literature to back it up. There
is an awful feeling of scantiness about it ;
the skirt of Mr. Finn’s piece ends somewhere
above the knee, and there is no bodice to it, and
when the co. tries to make it go round it suggests
twelve people in one bed with a handkerchief over
them. Also there is no particular brilliance to
make up for this brevity; the puns are common
and moth-eaten, and the humor is as plain in
many places as the countenance of the hardened
female who runs a hash-turret. And this inex-
pensive play has been put on the stage in a pain-
fully cheap fashion —in fact, nothing that looked
much cheaper has been seen at the Royal within
the present writer’s recollection.
* * * *
The co. runs the burlesque on its own with
very little assistance from the libretto, and none
worth speaking of from anybody else. Maggie
Moore plays Trilby with a joyful vim and a wild
desire to show her “fut” to everybody in and out
of season, and she sings various songs which bring
down the house and cause quite a rush of vege-
tables over the footlights. Roberts’ Svengali is a
very fine imitation of Fax’s dirty mesmerist in
his voice and his grime and the clawing of his
long, loamy talons ; and his jungle of unkempt
hair is Fax’s hair to a nicety. Roberts fills in
more gaps in the narrative than anything else, and
if it wasn’t for his business, which is mostly
admirable, the show would end about 9 o’clock.
His rush through the piano, however, is largely
discounted by the fact that no special effort has
been made to make that instrument look real—in
fact, it is a cheap and glaring fake of paper, and
not even brown paper at that—but the versatile
artist does all he can under the circumstances.
Gecko, the third support of the play, is also a
duplicate of Fax’s familiar, and Walter Rivers puts
a lot of valuable comedy into the part, though the
part itself wouldn’t be overcrowded on an envelope.
Rivers looks wildly unutterable, and his hair
makes up for many things. Also, Robert Kennedy
is a much more realistic Laird than the original,
and when he sings his Scotch songs an odor of
haggis and kilt is wafted across the footlights.
The rest of the co. have hardly a remark among
them. “ Trilby,” taking it for all it is worth, is
painfully small, and it tapers off rather feebly at
the end, and the second act (there are only two)
is mainly very ordinary variety show, and all the
efforts of the co. can’t wholly disguise the fact that
there isn’t enough skeleton to hang the meat upon.
Yet it is a huge, roaring success, and the rush of
the multitude on the stairs is a fact against which
there is no arguing.

Sydney Lyceum resumes business on Satur-
day, when Mrs. Potter and Curly Bellew start
three nights of “La Tosca.” Wednesday, Thurs-
day, and Friday of next week are devoted to
“David Garrick,” and on the ensuing Saturday
the co. puts up “ As You Like It,” by the immor-
tal Shakesbacon. The prospect of seeing the fair
Cora in the biking costume of Rosalind has
already sent a thrill through the blase citv of
Sydney.
** # *
Her Majesty’s, Sydney, has been renovated
inside and the electric-light fixings put in order,
so that there is no longer risk (as there lias been
any time in the last year or two) of the show being
suddenly buried in gloom and the audience left to
find its way out by match. Charles Holloway
opens at H.M.’s on Saturday with a new com-
pany, the first production being “ A King of
Crime.” This is the drama which, with Albert
Marsh as the criminal monarch, boomed the same
theatre to a big success in ’94, at a time when it
had long been down among the dust and potsherds ;
but a lot of the show on that occasion consisted of
Marsh, and whether the same luck will attend it
without him is an open question. “A King of
Crime” happens, like most other things, by ar-
rangement with Plain Bill Holloway. This an-
nouncement is so familiar nowadays that the
present writer fully expects some day to fall
downstairs by arrangement with Plain Bill Hol-
loway, and break his neck. Meanwhile, the new
lessee starts with a streak of bad luck, inasmuch
as he couldn’t get the theatre open last Saturday
and make a boom during the temporary eclipse of
the Lyceum. The Bulletin had an idea of deco-
rating this page with a picture, by “Hop,” show-
ing C. Holloway breaking a few things to relieve
his feelings on this painful subject.

Rev. Charles Clark will last until Satur-
day, when he delivers his final lecture the 130th
which he has given in Sydney. Then he starts
Melbournewards, en route to England, where he
will probably catch a bad cold from the sudden
change of climate and die young, leaving Smythe
an orphan. This is the sort of luck which gene-
rally befalls a man whom the world can’t very well
spare.
*- * * *
The Nerveless Man, one of the most un-
comfortable-looking spectacles that ever went into
the show business, reports that he is about to tour
Queensland, starting at Brisbane. This person’s
speciality is that he seems practically incapable of
feeling pain, and he earns his gruesome oats by
having long pins publicly stuck through him, and
other unpleasantnesses. But for the disfigure-
ment he wouldn’t even mind having a bonfire lit
on his stomach, and in a dull, unemotional sort of
way he really doesn’t care what happens to him.
Outwardly he is an ordinary sort of person with,
seemingly, no constitution to speak of, and there
is a world-weary, shambling aspect about him
which suggests that life has lost its savour. A
man who is practically proof against injury can’t
get the same joy out of dodging cabs that another
man does, and probably this is the reason why the
Nerveless Man looks so tired, and has such a very
aged and haggard soul looking out of two eyes
that are no color in particular.

N.S.W.’s God-fearing Ministry is still
going strong. In the Subukban Times (Sydney)
is printed a programme of a bun-worry in connec-
tion with the City Mission, said bun-struggle
being held in an obscure hall out in the lost-dog
regions of Alexandria, Premier Reid in the chair.
The programme includes “opening hymn,”
“prayer by Rev. J. Green,” “Missionary’s Re-
port,” “address by the Hon. G. Reid,” “solo,
‘ Caller Herrin” (in character),’ a collection, and
an intimation that tickets are Is. each. The good
old God-fearing Ministry ! Consider the chap
that was going to save the country snuffling at a
suburban tea-fight where the prayer of the Rev. J.
Green is mixed up with “Caller Herrin’(incharac-
ter) ’’ —said character consisting mainly of short
petticoats and ankles !
** * *
“The Rivals,” produced at Melb. Prin-
cess’, is Sheridan’s famous comedy altered to suit
the times and satisfy Joe Jefferson, whose part of
Bob Acres has been taken over by Nat Goodwin.
Great masses of the original story are absent from
the American version, and small bits of funny
business figure as modern improvements. The
omitted portions had grown to be considered tire-
some, the “new” items are popular stage tricks
often practised in comic opera, so “ The Rivals,”
in its present form, is better from a managerial
point of view than the play which a bottle-nosed
genius devised for a bygone generation. It is
divided into three acts only, instead of five, and
the curtain falls at about half-past 10.
* * * *
Mr. Goodwin and company give a perform-
ance free from any suggestion of last century. If
the late J. B. Buckstone, Henry Howe, the Chip-
pendales, and others were fairly truthful exponents
of the characters that Sheridan drew, the show
under notice is merely a passable absurdity. The
artists have no manners worth mentioning, nor
are they dressed as, say, the B. and B. company
would dress their parts. In some cases, they hide
their native accent at the expense of naturalness,
Miss Mortimer, as the immortal Mrs. Malaprop,
being the most striking instance in point. She
spouts her droll remarks in a portentous mono-
tone, and probably gets credit for acting her part
well from listeners who haven’t heard it spoken
with more spirit, inflection, and spontaneousness.
Sir Anthony Absolute roars mechanically, but the
humor of his character is not altogether ruined by
the actor’s rough treatment. Sir Lucius O’Trigger
is a tame fire-eater, and the dashing Captain Abso-
lute appears to be an uncomfortable young city clerk
in a military uniform. Bob Acres is converted
into Nat Goodwin. The stupid English yeoman
talks like an American, and fools in the latest
farcical-comedy style. He is not to be thought of
as a real person, but he excites a good deal of
genuine laughter in addition to a large quantity
of forced merriment. Nevertheless Nat Goodwin,
regarded as himself alone, will not enlarge his
Australian reputation with this effort. “ The
Rivals ” is to run for six nights, or even longer.
It may prove the success of the season, thanks to
the author, whose clever creations have not been
put upon the Melb. stage for fifteen long years.

Alice Leamar, John Coleman, La Belle
Maie, and other people who had been away for
some time, came back to Melb. Opera House in a
glittering battalion last Saturday night. They
will glitter for one consecutive week, and no
longer. In fact, they only got there through un-
expected circumstances owing to a delay in the
arrival of Carl Hertz, who makes his first appear-
ance this Saturday.
*# * *
The arrival of Ovide Musin was also de-
layed, but it is now distinctly understood that the
brilliant fiddler will appear at the Athemeum Hall
next Saturday (15th). Madame Trebelli gives a
matinee concert at the Town Hall to-day (Thurs-
day), and a farewell evensong on Saturday. Mean-
while the Bijou, which was to have re-opened last
week, is just as much closed as usual, but the
annual dog-show and conversazione of high-bred
fowls is raging at the Exhibition Building.
“ Cheer Boys Cheer” is not doing so well
as it might at Melbourne Royal, owing to the
smartness of the dialogue, or because a number of
intelligent remarks are put into the mouths of
supernumerary characters who can’t speak them
properly, or because young man Patten is a fatal
lover, br on account of all these things, together
with other causes that attract less attention.
Cheer Boys Cheer ” ought not to fail at the
house where so many feebler and less expensive
entertainments have flourished. The first
act is a marvel of audacious ingenuity in
plot construction, and no gold-mine pro-
moter should forget to see it. Also, the
three following acts are lively, and the
gallantry of George Rignold’s army deserves great
praise, and the last act, although not very excit-
mg, is unusual. The play, on the whole, is a
worthy attempt to get away from musty tradi-
tions. If it doesn’t grow upon the public the
public must bear most of the blame, seeing that
the show has been intelligently cut and condensed
since the opening night, and that the performance
ru is much improved. “Cheer Boys
Cheer ’’ is the first spectacular drama which has
catered for the fat stockbroker who goes to the
theatre for a good larf.
At Poverty Point .
Geor* e Rignold, being quietly assisted up or down that
hillock in the battle-scene of “Cheer, Boys, Cheer,” was
a rather pathetic subject last week. Hazlitt did the
needful for the “ boss,” whose winces, as he gripped the
helping hand, could be easily detected through an opera-
glass. It is hard to play the gallant soldier hero when
the gout is gnawing at your martial tread, and business is
no better than it ought to be.
Cannot Rignold take a lesson from Emelie Melville?

Potter and Bellew did well in Adelaide, but there was
not the enthusiasm of the former season. •’ Camille,” the
play that “ fetches” the pietistie crowd, was ohly put on
tor one night, a managerial blunder. There wasn’t time
to work up the dirty saints by press correspondence.

S.b.: “ I like Nat. Goodwin’s ‘ln Mizzoura,’ and am
anxious to testify. After a second visit, it strikes me as
one of the pleasantest little plays we have had on the
boards for a long time. It lacks the literary brilliance
and dramatic strategy of Pinero’s and Oscar Wilde’s
smartest, but, as a spell of real life lifted right out of Pike
County and set down before an Australian audience, it is
most convincing. I don’t know Pike County nor Pike
County people personally, but, in ‘ln Mizzoura,’we see
the creations of A. B. Frost’s marvellous pencil in flesh
a <>Ti, u° d ’ and c P ob toe Ravor of quaint naturalness out
of the best material of the American artists in small fiction.
Ihe taciturnity, deliberation, and happy knack of phrase
displayed by Goodwin’s backwoods sheriff are true charac-
tenstics of a peculiarly American growth, if Bret Harte,
Ambrose Bierce, and all the rest of them have not con-
spired to he us into this belief. The sheriff’s pretty sister,
the slatternly girl who is always tired, the long, lean
coachbuUder s assistant, whose limbs poke suddenly out
of his clothes, and who, although working all day and half
the night, continually laments his want of a ‘ stiddv job,’
ana the practical, idiomatic housewife, all ring true ;>s
teal American raw products, and Goodwin’s team are very
™ ucb at home here. I hope the management will start
the Sydney season with ‘ In Mizzoura.’ ”
Musgrove has measured Nellie Stewart for a theatre
and is building it in London. This is what comes of
having a beautiful actress on hand ; you naturally have to
build a theatre round her. Then if she goes away you
spend the rest of your life hunting for someone who can
wear the building’, and it remains a burden on your soul
for ever afterwards.

Emeiie Melville attended last week’s meeting of Melb.
Shakespeare (society, at Dr. Neild’s invitation, and read
some passages from “ King Lear.” A subsequent discus-
sion as to King Lears age gave an opening fora happy
leinark by schoolmaster Wilson. Age, said Mr. W., was a
variable thing as in the case of Dr. Neild, who was gene-
ia y regarded as quite elderly. But, after noting
him in conversation with Miss Melville, one felt convinced
that the president of the society was a very young man.
Whereat the Shakespearians got as near to roaring with
laughter as their intellectual culture would allow them.
The musical enthusiasts of Coolgardie and Perth mean
to do their little bit in the way of sending an Australian
voice Ome to be trained. Miss Neva Carr-Glynn, a short,
thick-set young lady, with a rather taking but, as yet,
rough, contralto, and not the very best ear in the world
(judging from her ballad warbling with the Rickards
companies), is the Westralian conception of “ another
Ada Crossle}'.” Miss Neva, by the way, is Mrs. Walter
Baker s sister. She makes the 59th “coming Orossley,”
of whom The Bulletin has been advised within the last
year. Why pick and choose between all these candidates
for culture at the public expense? Better to raise one
vast subscription and confide every woman in Australia
between the ages of 17 and 60 to the tuition of Madame
Marchesi, in Paris. No doubt Markasy would reduce her
terms for a wholesale order.
In the Trebelli concert advts. Maggie Stirling is termed
a contralto. Miss Stirling, who has commenced to display
her beautiful voice with real artistic taste in some num-
bers, is an undeniable mezzo.
Herr Kretschmann, one of Sydney’s most cultured
musicians, has publicly brought forward another of his
clever pupils. Miss Yvonne Leverrier, a pianiste, recently
appeared with the Marshall Hall orchestra in Melbourne
so successfully that she was immediately captured by the
Metropolitan Liedertafel to play at its concert. Later,
Herr Kretschmann will parade his pupil before Sydnej
audiences. Another of the veteran German’s pupils who
created a furore with her playing in Sydney is the gifted
Miss Esther Kahn.
The American mummers now in Melbourne comment
on the dullness of that city at night, also on its general
inhospitality. The latter, however, is due not to intention
but to stupidity. Nobody in Melbourne knows how to
approach and entertain a stranger. “ Australians when
they come to America are rushed,” said a leading member
of the co., “ but Americans here are just allowed to pass
through.”
At Melb. Princess on the first night of “Mizzoura”
manager Tallis had to ask a dress-circle johnny to stop
laughing. The laugh was like an exaggerated sea-gull’s
“ craik, craik,” and was spoiling every pathetic passage
of the play.
“ Pat” Bathurst has succeeded to Brovvnlow’s parts in
the Williamson and Musgrove Opera Co., and according
to Maoriland press notices has made a success of them.
This clever young mummer is better known to the world

Henry Lawson’s book of prose yarns will

Louise Mack’s serial story reaches a crisis
in August Cosmos, and makes it clearer than ever
that monthly serials should be suppressed by
literary law. “Esotericus” pessimises over Aus-
tralia’s future; and Editor Montgomery inner-
views Bland Holt and wife with illustrations and
agreeable results. Geo. Essex Evans rhymes
neatly and numerously, “Titus Salt ” humouresces
characteristically concerning a unique voyage
through Magellan’s Straits ; and there is a contri-
bution on aboriginal art by W. A. Squire, and one
by W. Harding on a man-eating plant which was
poisoned by a packet of arsenic in the pocket of
its all-but victim. Agnes Macready gives some
pretty and poetic verses, though the close seems
rather feeble and conventional ; and N. V. rhii-
pott gets some stirring emotion into a story which
hinges on the not-new situation of a woman being
saved from flight with hubby’s friend by the
“new life stirring”—as if the “new life wasnt
obvious previously. Altogether the number is
well-varied, and the quality is improving.

Premier Reid somehow can’t even present a
bald statement of figures in the Gazette without mis-
representing the facts to boom his own system of finance.
The N.S.W. revenue for July, ’96, was £107,209 less than
that, for July, ’95, and a footnote is appended, pointing
out that £88,829 of this decline is caused by the abolition
of certain Customs duties, so “ the decrease for the month
on the basis of the present tariff ”is only £18,380. The
real state of things is that G. Beid lost during the month
£88,829 by taking off Customs duties, and gained £22,733
by putting on the income-tax, therefore the real decline
in the revenue—that is to say, the decline which tends to
show how much worse things are this year than in July,
’95, is not £18,380 but £41,112. The utter impossibility
of getting G. Beid to tell the whole truth about anything
is a strange and crab-like circumstance.
* » * *
The new financial year starts badly in two pro-
vinces. The July revenue in Victoria is £3364 less than
the revenue for the corresponding month last year. And
in N.S.W. the July revenue is £107,209 less than that for
July, ’95.

The Seddon Govt, is going to float a £1,000,000
loan on the ground that it is impossible to carry on public
works without raising more money. Why is it ? Between
1889 and 1895 the annual interest on the public debt was
reduced by conversion operations and otherwise from
£1,866,000 to £1,656, 000-saving £210,000 per annum.
Also, the population increased so much, ancl there are
now so many more people to bear the liability that the
reduction in the burden is really much greater even than
it looks. Maoriland could put up nearly £500,000 a year
in extra taxation for public works —in which case there
would be no need for a loan—and yet not be burdened
any more heavily than it was in 1890. And as it got
through in 1890 and in other years that were even worse,
there is every reason to believe that it could do so now —
if the Ministry wasn’t hankering after votes for next
general election.
& * * * *
They all do it more or less. For the coming
year the Victorian Govt, proposes spending £286,000 of
borrowed money on roads, drainage, and other works that
yield no direct revenue —the money to be repaid by in-
stalments in about 15 years if nothing goes wrong. Pro-
bably something will go wrong. Queensland proposes
spending about £160,000 of borrowed funds on big guns,
ammunition, dredging, and other non-revenue-producing
jobs which properly belong to current expenditure.
Maoriland is going to spend £500,000 of borrowed cash on
road-making and similar works of ordinary expenditure ;
and N.S. YVales is apparently going to “blew” about
£600,000 of loans in the same fashion/ The great art and
mystery of surplus-making. *
The usually patient Brisbane Courier has risen
m revolt, and demands a strict investigation into the
affairs of the Queensland National Bank before it is
permitted to further reconstruct the £3,000,000 or more
of Government money which it still holds. It describes
the Q.N.B. as the most reticent banking institution in
Australia, and the accusation is very nearly correct.
Among the reconstructs of 1893, the City of Melbourne
frankly burst up. The North Queensland and Commer-
cial of Sydney released their reconstructed deposits in
full. The E.S. and A. reconstructed again after a rigid
overhaul of its accounts. The National, Victoria, London,
A.J.S., and Boyal of Queensland are paying off their
liabilities by instalments. Among the banks which asked
for further assistance from their creditors, the Q.N.B.
is the only one which kept on paying dividends to
its ordinary shareholders even when it was known to
almost every one that it would have to get more
concessions from depositors. Its balance-sheet doesn’t
even profess to show, like those of the A.J.S. and
Commercial of Australia, how the liquidation, of the old
boom assets is getting on. No one knows by its balance-
sheet whether it is doing any new business at all ;
whether it has any new deposits or only those which are
so fixed that they can’t get away ; whether any of the 4J
per cent, deposits have ever been paid off ; how much the
locked-up assets from the pre-smash days amount to;
whether any progress has been made at liquidating them ;
whether there is' no loss by depreciation or whether the
loss amounts to a million or several millions ; or anything
else worth speaking about. The lumping together of
reconstructed Go vernment deposits, new ditto, reconstruc-
ted private deposits, new private deposits, current
accounts and “other liabilities” makes it impossible to
tell how public confidence stands, or falls down, in the
Q.N.8., and the lumping together of the old assets,
whose unrealisability brought about the 1893 sus-
pension, with the new ones, shuts out any informa-
tion as to whether the former are being realised, and, if
so, how fast, and whether they are being loaded up
with unrealisable interest or not—in fact, the whole
s tuation is a mystery. Public opinion, as evinced by the
share-market, values Q.N.B. deposits lower than those of
the Commercial of Australia (which showed i 24,000 loss
last half-year as against the Q.N.B’s alleged £lO,OOO
profit), and its shares (£5 10s. paid-up) are constantly
quoted “no buyers.” The Q.N. Bank, in fact, is the
financial conundrum of Australia, and it wants an inde-
pendent overhaul very badly—especially considering that
£3,000,000 or more of public money is at stake.

It is solemnly reported that the Maoriland
Government won’t ask Parliament this session to “ raise
money ” for starting a State Fire Insurance Office. How
much money does such an office want “ raised? If the
State will advance £lO,OOO from the trust-funds for pre-
liminary expenses (to be repaid out of the first year’s or
two or three years’ premiums), and deposit with the office
£250,000 of State 31 per cent, debentures which it can sell
to raise money in the unlikely event of a big conflagration
and a very heavy bill for losses striking it before the pre-
miums have accumulated sufficiently (the debentures to
bear interest only when they pass out o, the department’s
hands), the institution would be afloat. The chief argu-
ment now advanced against the proposal is that it would
oust all other fire offices from Maoriland, therefore there
would be no other offices to re-insure big risks with, and
“ the largest fire insurance office in the world couldn’t
venture to insure whole cities on its own sole responsi-
bility.” Which is true as far as existing offices are con-
cerned. But then the biggest existing fire office has
about £6,000,000 of capital and reserves, and the Maori-
land State Office would have a capital of over £200,000,000
—in fact, its capital would be the whole country and
everything in it and all its credit outside. A concern like
that could insure the biggest risk in Maoriland “ on its
own,” and not feel it.

The Sydney and Suburban Hydraulic Power
Co. reports that the half-year’s net profits are £3147, and
a dividend at the rate of 7J per cent, per annum absorbs
£2812, leaving the ro. with a total profit and loss balance
of £2210. The Hydraulic Co’s assets include a claim on
a guarantee co., now awaiting appeal, of £939, and 1600
law-costs, both of which items may be recovered if the
case is decided in the Hydraulic’s favor, while if it goes
wrong these and the further law-costs will have to be
written off, which will mop up most of the above balance.
Another asset is “Parliamentary rights and concessions”
(i.e., goodwill), £15,000, and a third is “preliminary ex-
penses.” These items are eminently shadowy, and at the
date of last balance-sheet the Hydraulic Co. had really
only £98,880 of visible assets against over £109,000 of
solid-looking liabilities to shareholders, debenture-holders,
and other creditors. A concern in this condition would
do well to pay a smaller dividend and devote the balance
to writing down the alleged goodwill.
* » * *
The balance-sheet of the Bank of North Queens-
land, which was commented upon last week, appears in
another part of this issue. The profits, though small,
show a remarkable improvement on last half-year’s
figures, and the solidity of the institution, so far as con-
cerns depositors and other creditors, is conspicuous.
* * * *
Balmain New Ferry Co. reports that the net
profits for the half-year ended 30th June are £1670, which
is apparently a slight falling-off from last year’s rate by
reason of increased expenses. An interim dividend at the
rate of 10 per cent, per annum absorbs £672, and, after
writing off £641 for depreciation and towards preliminary
expenses, the co. is still £357 to the good. The previous
half-year’s balance of £663 makes a total of £lO2O to credit
of profit and loss. By an extraordinary process of book-
keeping, however, the £5OO set aside last half-year as a
reserve for maintenance of steamers has been included
among the receipts, making the profit and loss balance
£1520. It is further explained that the directors have
applied this reserve towards building a new vessel.
Another item, “ Reserve Fund, £304,” which ap-
peared in last balance-sheet, has also, apparently,
made an unaccountable disappearance, and so has an
item described as “ Accrued from forfeited shares,
£276.” As far as the visible evidence goes, it would
seem that the directors of the co. cheerfully apply the re-
serves to purposes they were not specifically intended for
very much at their own discretion. The co. is decidedly
prosperous, however, and, except for the amazing manner
in which its accounts are presented, and the way its re-
serve funds come and go without any visible explana-
tion, there isn’t much to complain of. Still, this latter
point ought to be cleared up. There are plenty of com-
panies where the reserves vanish from among the assets,
but a concern where they blow right off the balance-sheet
is an anomaly.
*' * * *
The Commercial Building and Investment Co.
(Sydney), one of the few survivors of the great breakage
of a year or two ago, reports that the year’s income from
rents was only £10,267 —equal to about 4 per cent, on
nominal values; and as the expenses were £13,794 the
concern went £3527 to the bad on the year’s work. It is
further added that during the last 12 months things have
got worse on the whole than they were before, and rents
have dropped, and the demand for properties has dimin-
ished, and nothing cheering has happened.
* * * *
The Civil Service Mutual B. and I. Society
(Sydney), which had the luck to be formed after the boom
had collapsed, so that it didn’t get loaded up with bricks
and mortar at impossible prices, finished its fourth year
on 30th June. The net profit is £453, as against £435 for
previous year. A div. at 5 per cent, per annum absorbs
£379, and the balance (£74) is added to profit-and-loss,
making it £928. Of this, £5OO is employed to start a
reserve-fund, and £428 is carried forward. The society is
a prosperous-looking affair on a small scale —the capital
is onlv £15,250, and deposits £2291. Also, it is quite un-
intentionally a powerful essay on the necessity for a State
Land Bank. Its chief asset is “ Loans, £12,149,” and as
the interest for the year is £1302 it would appear that the
miserable borrower pays 10 per cent, for his accommoda-
tion. Working-expenses and depreciation of the office-
furniture absorb over £7OO, so this small concern has
actually to charge its borrowers about 5)4 per cent, to
cover working-expenses alone, and another 4J4 per cent,
to earn a very moderate return for its shareholders.
Against this, the Maoriland State Loan Department works
at an expense of about 15s. per cent., and the difference
is all saved to the borrower. Said difference lies in the
fact that one institution keeps an office, six directors, two
auditors, a manager, a surveyor, and a firm of solicitors
to look after less than £20,000, and the other keeps about
the same amount of pomp to look after £1,500,000. The
small twopenny building society must be an extortioner
to live ; the enormous ratio of expenses makes moderation
impossible. * * *
The assay fiend is still large and rampant at
Coolgardie. In the absence of regular crushings “ assays ”
are the usual emergency, and but for newspapers they
would have no visible lawful means of support. “ Three
samples of stone from the Perseverance mine have assayed
260 z. gold, 61oz. silver; 370 z. gold, B‘2oz. silver ; 450 z.
gold, 87oz. silver.” Kalgoorlie sends along a 630 z. assay
from “a rich strike” made at Broad Arrow. Any paper
that pays for and publishes such news does not know its
business, and is being played upon by boomers for boom
purposes. How is it we never have any assays from
Charters Towers ?
* * * *
One of the experts who appeared before the Life
Assurance Board of Inquiry (Melbourne) made the startling
assertion that “it would be a most pernicious thing to
attempt to state what was the standard of solvency ; the
standard set up would necessarily have to be a very mild
one.” The news that the standard would have to be a
very mild one —presumably because some of the offices
couldn’t otherwise get through—is interesting to insurers.
And why, in the name of all that is wonderful, would it
be “most pernicious” to define what is solvency, instead
of leaving societies to be as insolvent as they please ? The
actuai’y’s business is an exact science—so exact that the
extent of any society’s liabilities can be ascertained with
almost absolute accuracy. It would be no hardship to
enact that no society must reckon on its assets producing
more than, say, 3J per cent, or 4 per cent, interest. And
beyond that, the standard would simply require that the
office should have enough assets, on an independent
valuation, to cover its liabilities, which are easily ascer-
tained. In what possible way is it “most pernicious” to
require by law that a society’s assets must cover its
liabilities? Such evidence is calculated to set the public
wondering how the witness’s own society, if he is con-
nected with one, would stand investigation.

The liquidators of the English and Australian
Mortgage Bank, which is just paying a second div. of 6d.
in three .years, propose to lump its assets with those of
sundry other Daviesian institutions, so that there may be
one vast collection of unsaleable properties under uniform
management, instead of several rival lots, each holding
hopeless auction-sales “on its own.” The father of this
proposal is Mr. Kay, the liquidator who wasn’t allowed to
give unpleasant evidence at the trial of the Mercantile
Bank directors.

The Crown Prosecutor’s indictment of the City
of Melbourne Bank’s last balance-sheet gave Alfred
Deakin, for the defence, an opportunity to revive his pet
legal argument—they all did it. “ After declaring a divi-
dend of £20,000 within one little month, ere the ink was
dry on the balance-sheet, their doors were closed,” said
prosecutor Finlayson. “ How many other banks closed
their doors ?” asked Deakin, as though his precious conun-
drum were pertinent to the case. The other day, in the
course of the Mildura inquiry, a witness testified to the
honesty of Deakin as a man and a politician. Deakin the
lawyer, when engaged in bank oases, is an unblushing
preacher of the Smellbourne gospel that ten blacks make
a white.
* * * *
Smellbourne is divided between two ideas re
the City of Melb. Bank prosecution. One, that the trial
is meant to show indisputable cause for the Companies
Act amendments, drafted by Attorney-General Isaacs.
The other, that it is a sop to British creditors, who, up to
now, have had no return for the pile of money spent in
talking about criminal proceedings against other directors.
Anyway, the C. of M. Bank case is open to suspicion.
How on earth could Chairman Loader and colleagues be
found guilty whilst a dozen, or two, of false balance-
sheeters roamed at large ? And if they were found guilty,
how could they be put into the prison from which bank-
manager Staples was secretly set free? Smellbourne’s
morality must be consistent.

N.S.W. Chief Secretary Brunker is in a blissful
state of ignorance about the doings of private “labor
registry offices.” He is “ not aware ” that some of these
so-called labor-agents charge employers nothing at all,
nor that they milk the possible salaries of employes far in
advance, before even “ laying them on” to employers.
Mr. Brunker probably “ nevah reads the papahs”—except
their “God-fearing” portions. He is “considering”
whether these Labor vampires should be registered and
supervised by the State. And this in a land that sells
licenses even to milk-vendors. “ Considering ! ”
* * * *
The alliance of theN.S.W. penny-postage move-
ment with the scheme to impose a halfpenny postage-fee
on newspapers (within the province) must inevitably lead
to the abolition of the special class subsidy to the metro-
politan journals. Postmaster-General Cook, under the
Cabinet whisperings of Stage Prompter Reid, opposes
both proposals on the ground that penny-postage will
take away £50,000 worth of revenue, and that, judging by
Victoria’s experience, a halfpenny newspaper postage-
rate will only yield £15,000. Cook says that in Victoria
15,000,000 newspapers are posted annually, and, at £d.
each, only yield £15,000. Cook’s £, therefore, contains
500 pence, inasmuch as 15,000,000 halfpence equal £31,250.
Cook has evidently graduated in arithmetic under “ Eye-
glass ” Reid—the monocular “A B ” being “2 and 2 make
27.”

Three months ago kaolin was found at the 500 ft.
level in the Broken Hill Proprietary mine—the first ever
found at that depth. Then the stuff was very poor, but
lately, when struck at another point, the ore shows an
improvement. Welcome, of course, and geologically in-
teresting ; but a good smelting ore, though possessed of
much smaller metallic contents, would be more valuable
to the co.
* # * •
Concerning a recent Bulletin par. about a kaolin
discovery' somewhere or other. New-chum silver-pro-
spectors, hearing much of the Broken Hill kaolin develop-
ments, are apt to conclude, when they strike kaolin, that
they have got into another Broken Hill. But kaolin is
merely fine clay, and its occurrence as a silver gangue is
phenomenal. And, anyway, even at Broken Hill, it is
about the most uncertain of all the deposits.

The North and South B.H. Co’s amalgamate to
secure Mr. D. Edwards as engineer, to have full charge of
the mills. Good biz. A miner, even a good miner,
doesn’t necessarily know anything of fine ore-dressing by
patent processes. The South mill, though, doesn’t want
much managing ; the North mill wants a lot of it, partly
because it is ah unholy makeshift mixture of old and new
machinery, but more because of the extreme variableness
of the ore, aforetime commented on.
* * * *
According to chairman M'Bryde, at the half-
yearly meeting of B.H. Proprietary Go., “it would be
impossible to pay a shilling dividend monthly if the
yield was not up to the usual standard, and the proba-
bility was that until the end of the year they would only
be able to pay a div. every second month; but share-
holders need not fear that it would not continue to be a
div.-paying mine.” A Bulletin par. the other week was
to the effect that on last half-year’s figures Is. divs. could
now be paid regularly until January next, when one
would have to be passed. But now the directors have
decided upon treating 5000 tons of sulphides weekly ; the
average last half-year was under 800 tons a week. Which,
of course, makes all the difference. And the decision, too,
means all the difference between discreet and indiscreet
management.

British mill running on carbonate —not sul-
phides, as it was going to do in view of the alleged Burn-
ham Syndicate agreement. Apparently that agreement
is “off,” never, perhaps, having been completely “on.”
And some hundreds of poor beggars are left nursing a
very expensive baby acquired on the strength of positive
statements that an agreement had been concluded. The
responsibility for the whole bungle wants fixing some-
where. Still the mine has its prospects, though divs. on
such a capital must on present developments be micro-
scopic.

Fitzgerald Moore, one of the best known of
what the daily papers call “ mining men,” died, the other
day, at Coolgardie. Moore, who was one of the most
plausible of people, had a hand in a hundred different
schemes in all parts of the world, and few of them suc-
ceeded. Mostly, though, Mr. Moore knew when to get
out. An engineer by profession, he was the introducer of
both smelting and concentrating methods on the Barrier,
and through his agency a smelter and afterwards a mill
were erected at the Pinnacles, which claim he introduced
to the public 11 years ago. The little affair of the Round
Hill boom seven years back “cruelled” him, until the
Coolgardie gamble set him on his feet again.
The Pinnacles, by the way, seems to be the
Deeming of mining. Moore, who floated the claim
originally ; Lamont, who built and ran the smelting fur-
nace ; G. M‘L. Matheson, who promoted the Cockburn-
Pinnacles-Broken Hill tramway ; Greenway, the broker
and biggest dealer in Pinnacles in the early days—all are
dead, though all were comparatively young men.

Hillgrove mines, N.S.W.—Baker’s Creek, 499

taining 960 z. ; Sunlight, 800 tons, 3530 z., concentrates
58oz. ; West Sunlight, 350 tons, 1210 z., concentrates 620 z.
Generally, things are looking much better in this camp,
and some heavy pegging was" done a few days ago on the
Eleanora line, in the hope of another boom. One boom
one generation in all N.S.W. camps.

Wyalong mines—Bolte’s, 7 tons of pyrites, 1330 z.;

Golden Fleece, 400 tons, 5700 z.; N.S. Wales, 18 tons, 109 oz.
In the absence of leases, this camp has had more legitimate
mining, perhaps, but very much less boom ; and many
Wyalongites would prefer to have it the other way about.
All the available boom of Australia is monopolised by
Westralia. Anyway, there is not enough boom on this
continent to go right round.

A mining case of considerable interest was
decided by the N.S.W. Full Cojurt on 7th inst. It was
sought to quash a conviction made by the Newcastle
P.M., under which appellant, manager of the Newcastle-
Wallsend Co., was fined for not supplying sufficient air to
the men in the colliery. The case depended upon the
meaning of certain words in rule 3 of the Coal Mines
Regulation Act, which states that an adequate amount
of ventilation shall mean not less than 100 cubic feet per
minute for each man, boy, and horse, which shall sweep
undiminished along the airway past each working place.
The point at issue was whether “ working place ” meant
merely the entrance of the bord, or the actual “ face ” at
which the miner was at work. The magistrate had held
that the air-current had to be taken to the men ; the Full
Court, however, was of opinion that it was enough if it
should sweep past the mouth of the bord in which they
were working. It was stated by one witness, and adopted
bv the Chief Justice, that if the current swept past the
entrance the whole bord would be ventilated by diffusion.
Nothing could be further from the truth. The smoke
generated by a shot fired early in the morning at the face
of a bord is often not dissipated in the afternoon, eight
hours later, though a full current is sweeping all day past
the entrance of the bord.

The Sunlight G.M. Hillgrove, N.S.W., is giving
a lesson in economical mining. The royalty has also been
reduced. It should shortly be in a position to pay a
small regular monthly div.
* * * *
The Bulletin is pleased to state, after making
full inquiry, that the amount of money spent on the sur-
face of the Pambula G.M. Co.’s property is insignificant
compared to the amount expended beneath it, and that
the mine is worked in a miner-like manner.

G-undagai, N.S.W. : —“ Specimens have been
secured from the New Kimo reef of great richness. Only
a trial crushing of a ton has been treated. About 15 tons
at grass expected to yield Boz. per ton. The reef is not
yet properly defined, and the various geological forma-
tions appear to be jumbled up. The owners are jbreating

£30,000.” Well, ain’t it a free country? Any fellow own-
ing a reef “ with the various geological formations all
jumbled up,” and 15 tons of rich ore -at grass, can ask
£300,000 for it if he likes.

Sydney open Mining Exchange : “ The follow-
ing sale was recorded yesterday—Mt. Malcolm, Is. Id.”
It cannot pay to run an exchange at this rate.
From Kalgoorlie, average sample:— 1 lie lode
in the Mount Alexandria mine is 60 to 70ft. wide, but
only 15 to 16ft. of it is very rich on the fqotwall side.
Here the gold occurs in spikes in soft kaolin, and bulk
samples show the stone to be worth 5 to 6oz. to the ton.”
There are so many 5 and lOoz. mines around Kalgoorlie
that it is very strange to see three mines working 3 to
4oz. ore producing three-fourths of the gold of the entire
field.

“ Mr. Fearby gives a glowing account of a W.A.
find—Morgan and Millar’s. While taking out samples
with his pick, he unearthed one solid piece of gold, 8m.
long and 2in. thick. It is the most wonderful show he
has ever seen in his life, and surpasses anything yet
seen in W.A.” A hunk of gold this size should turn the
scale at 180oz. Alas ! we have all read too many glowing
accounts of the same sort re W.A. mines which subse-
quently closed down for want of gold. P.S. —Did Fearby
hang liis hat on that hunk ?

The prospectus of the Gen. Gordon Junction
gold-mine, which got a premature mention in Tire Bulle-
tin through a proof-sheet going astray, was published
from Adelaide last week. As first stated, the G.G.
Junction is a spec of 80,000 ten shilling shares issued at
five shillings, the vendor taking 30,000 shares and £6000
cash. The mine proposes to start with an available work-
ing capital of £6000 odd, and the reports of G. R. Fearby
and others are very good, as reports go. Portions of the
Gen. Gordon main' lode are said to crop up within the
property, also another lode 100ft. wide appears to pass
through its centre, wherefore the prospectus breathes a
hopeful spirit which may prove to be quite justifiable.
On the authority of Bewick and Moreing, Lon-
don engineers, the bulk of the stone of Bayley’s will go
6dwt., but the occurrence of rich pockets should bring it
up to 12 and 15dwt. Cost of mining and milling is put
down at £1 a ton, and amalgamation with the South and
a mine to the north is recommended. What has become
of the “wonderfully rich patch” struck in the mine a
week or two back ?

The report of meeting of shareholders of the
Great Blow mine held in London is a pitiable
instance of J. Bull’s credulity. Captain W. Bell-
M‘Taggart, chairman, said there was a million tons of ore
in sight. He excused a lOdwt. bulk assay thus :—“ When
making a fire assay it was necessary to take out every
speck of gold that can be seen with the strongest micro-
scope.” Although they had this great mass of stone,
“which they could actually touch, sit down, and have
their dinner on, they had no water ; all their money was
gone, and unless some more was at once found, the mine
stood in jeopardy of being jumped.” Actual expenditure—
To purchase of mine, £25,000 cash (and £100,000 in shares);
spent on the mine, £16,490, and in London, £3728; in
machinery, £9720. The gallant Capt. read a long letter from
a “ celebrated mining man,” whose name was not disclosed,
who incidentally mentioned when he came to the value
of the ore as an average—“ I regret my instructions bind
me to leave these points untouched.” This the capt.
“ regarded as an extremely satisfactory letter.” He also
regarded the expenditure as extremely satisfactory “ con-
sidering we have ore to the value of one and a-half
millions in sight.” It was decided to reconstruct the eo.,
and everybody went away pleased with the mine and
their good judgment in going into it. First a Bull, next a
milch Cow, then a Goat.

Mount Morgan for July : 9786 tons for 13,090oz.

considerable attention was being given to its treatment.

Great Boulder (fortnight), 847 tons, 2773oz.
This mine has opened up so well at 200ft., as to prompt
the question why they don’t go down another 200ft. Is it
the experience of Brown Hill at 300ft. that causes hesi-
tation ?
* * * *
Want of sufficient water is the everlasting curse
of the Coolgardie goldfields, which great and irremove-
able trouble has impressed the Age and Sydney D.T.
special mining commissioner—“ The mines may be divided
into three classes—those that have lodes but no water,
those that have water but no lodes, and those that have
neither lodes nor water.” He truly regards it as the
great black outlook which will be the death of scores of
mines that could be worked to pay moderate profits if
only they were surrounded by favorable conditions. He
adds that as things now go the number of mines that will
pay dwindles down to an insignificant total. “ A resident
of Kanowna” writes in strong protest, naturally, and
refers to the number of instances where water has been
struck at shallow depths—but is careful to say not a word
about how suddenly these supplies disappear. A country
with next to no rainfall, with no rivers, not even creeks,
and no hope of an artesian supply, may have plenty of
wind but insufficient water. The little it does get is so
densely salt that much is lost by condensation. They can
therefore never have cheap mining in W.A.

The General Gordon crushing, it seems, is not
so much overdue as behind the time appointed for it by
rumor. The co. was floated in May, in June the battery
was ordered, in July it was despatched westward, and in
September the crushing will begin to happen. Predic-
tions among those interested vary from 5oz. to 7oz. on the
stuff now being raised. And the next crop is entirely in
the hands of Providence.

It is again becoming fashionable to offer mine
in London because of their vicinity to Mt. Morgan. The
latest is the Mt. Usher gold-mines, which appear to have
gone off. Capital, £140,000. Small _ reefs; picked stone
should go from two to three ozs. It is not witHin a dozen
miles of the big mine, but that doesn’t matter if it is good.

A parson located at Adelaide, writes to
a local paper to state on his own authority that
the Almighty objects to the popular respect paid
to Premier Kingston. “ There is a God in
Heaven,” he says, “and He is justly displeased
with South Australia.” The parson always mis-
takes himself for the Almighty in this way. The
reverend is aggravated at Kingston, therefore
he assumes that God must be also aggravated, and
states, the fact without any reservation whatever.
T his is why it is never any use arguing with a
parson. An ordinary man tries to prove that his
own little fad is. right. A parson merely says
that God regards it as right; and, if you ask
how he learned the fact, he says “ Go forth, thou
blasphemer !” or words to that effect. Then, if
you ask for further particulars, he says that you
will be Lost for evermore.

The Melbourne parson who sued an under-
taker the other day for burial-fees seems to have
got the shepherd business down on a plain business
footing. He was entitled, he said, to Bs. for each
burial m the Lpiscopal end of the cemetery,
whether he read the service or not. The under-
taker was supposed to hustle round and collect
the money from the friends of the corpse, and
hand it over. In this case the reverend wanted
<413 12s. for 34 burials ; 90 burials having already
been paid for. The undertaker refused to pay on one
corpse on the ground that it was of the Catholic
faith, which the parson denied; and he further
stated that he had given notice that he would be
dashed, or words to that effect, if he collected fees
for this parson any longer, and therefore his re-
sponsibility was ended. Moreover, he seemed to
imply that the parson was cantankerous and un-
reasonable, and not a nice man to do business
with. The parson averred that the whole trouble
arose because he wouldn’t pay the hearse-man 12J
per cent, commission for collecting, and the person
with the ghostly vehicle naturally wanted to know
why he should act gratis as any parson’s collector.
There was a lot about “ the account ” and the
‘account rendered,” and, in a general way, the
parson said “ Yah ” and the undertaker said
. Booh. This sort of thing throws Quite a new
light on the pathetic burial of Little Eva.

of the wild Irish policeman who patrols the railway

What most amused chose who happened
to listen to the Trinity College Mutual Admira-

Melbourne lately (writes a Bulletin correspon-

patients resenting students pawing over them,
they rather liked it, and, indeed, looked forward
to it with expectation. By the way, if it is a
national necessity that medical students should
have clinical instruction, why should the privilege
of suffering for one’s bleeding country be confined
to the “ sick poor ” ? Why not devise a scheme by
which the sick friends of the Freemasons’-hall
crowd which listened to the lecture might know
the joys of being pawed ? And why doesn’t the
person who says it is so enjoyable put his own
female relatives in the way of being pawed ?

A female, giving her name as Mary
Mahoney, was lately charged at Westminster
(Lon.) police-court with disorderly conduct. She
had kicked up an awful row at the Aquarium, and
the presiding magistrate sentenced her to 14 days
in the ordinary way of business. Whereupon a
gentleman, who is also a magistrate in his own
county, stepped forward and (rather pluckily) ad-
mitted that Mary Mahoney wasn’t any such
person, but bis own wife —in short, a disorderly
lady and not a disorderly woman. So the pri-
soner was remanded on bail for a week, after which
she was politely fined forty shillings. This story
is intended for the encouragement of wise parents
who exhort their children to be little ladies, or
little gentlemen, according to their sex. To grow
up into a plain, unvarnished man or woman is a
great mistake, for it leaves one quite at the mercy
of the law.

Hobart Mercury, 30th July, 1896 :
“ Hutchins School jubilee on 3rd proximo. • Com-

Bowral (N.S.W.) is a comforting place to
be buried in. The cemetery is a morass, and
when a grave is dug in wet weather the water rises
in it almost as if it was an artesian bore, and the
ghoul digs and bales turn about. At a recent,
funeral they dropped the deceased brother into
four feet of water, and he kept bobbing up all
through the service and being shoved under again,
till at last some thoughtful person got into the
grave and stood on him to hold him down. This
is why the ghosts at Bowral all have bad colds
and snuffle painfully under the trees on wet, windy
nights, and bark hollow barks among the shrub-
bery. Considering that no one really knows for
certain that a dead person hasn’t a consciousness
of his own —all we do know is that he has lost the
power of showing it, though even this is denied—
it might be more sympathetic to put him in a
dry place on the off-chance.
An Adelaide parson lately rose in the pulpit
to denounce the New Woman, and asked i 1 a fine

meetings, and rage around for money to repair the
church-steeple ?
The feeling grows
in Melbourne that
the ridiculous law
prohibiting the es-
tablishment of a Sun-

to be defiantly
broken. If it were,
public opinion would
probably be too
strong to permit of
a vigorous enforce-
ment. The English
press-laws were abol-
ished through the
defiant attitude of
Bradlaugh, Richard
Carlile, and other
men of pluck. The
Melb. people are so
utterly sick of the
domination of the
sour Presbyterian
boomers responsible
for the dull-Sunday
edicts that such an
attempt would al-
most surely be suc-
cessful.

Melb. tradesmen want to know how it is
that Gov. Brassey, with his mighty naval influence,
cannot draw the Fleet oftener, or at all, into
Hobson’s Bay, which sadly lacks its Potts’ Point
in gusty St. Kilda.
“ What is this rum made from?” an ex-
pert was asked in a recent Melbourne liquor-case.
“ Molasses, bits of straw, maize, and the sweep-
ings of the sugar-factories, ” was the reply. Three-
penny (Melb.-made) rums are becoming very
popular at Melb. bars, and the above accounts for
the size and vigor of the nobbier.

One Northern grievance is the trans-

well-known “Explorer’s Tree,” the iron-work of
Kennedy’s carts, and the iron tank in which poor
Mrs. Watson died, are all at present peacefully
reposing in the Bananaland metropolis.
A heavy Vic. father lately
circularised his tradesmen: —
“ Dear Sir, —My eldest daughter

Cable news of the death and
inquesting of a young Melb. lady
in London throws some light on
the subject of “pleasure” trips
to London. The deceased spin-
ster, who sailed from Melbourne
last May, was found to have
been delivered of twins through
an illegal operation.

FIRST OR LAST?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Softly and sweetly it floated up
From the lips that his lips had nursed,
“ My hero ! you say I’m your only love,
Darling, tell me, am I th e first? ”
A sigh rippled back over memory’s sea,
And broke on the shores of the past —
“ My first, thank God, you may never be,
But pray to be ever my last.”

~ r r . , r Sydney, August 12, 189 G.
Mr Dear Moorabinda—
X achieved a seat at the last “ Chinatown ”
morning performance last Wednesday at Sydney
Lyceum, and was not surprised to find that, owing
t? th ®,? ewi ßering sartorial abbreviations which
the Chinatown ladies superstitiously regard as
skirts in act 3, the wear and tear of a Sydney
season had left their elevated hems unscathed. I
hope Patrice, as the “dude,” will not start Aus-
tralian Johnnydom sporting soup-plate nosegays
again, through her effective trick of crowding a
whole cauliflower-head, apparently, into her but-
ton-hole. This kind of thing is good and worthy
’ n a mufoal trifle,” but when it comes to Reggie
de Tonbob doing the Block trimmed with four
sunflowers and a cabbage-rose, the thing is likely
to bring about a tax on button-holes. Which
reminds me that the P. of W. can’t possibly wear
coat-flowers, or else they never would have disap-
peared with such a rush. Nobody seems to wear
a button-holer now unless he is going to be mar-
ried, or in some equally irresponsible state of
mind. At balls now a button-holer is almost as
vulgar as a red silk handkerchief negligently
thrust into the dress weskit. J
It just occurs to me that it’s not the average
pretty actress’s fault that youths can’t find the
open sesame to her tender mercies—they get “ the
office clearly enough during the average airy per-
jTi I ’,®’ g ?<°r ( L? SS Here is an instance
° ! ec J, frcm . Chinatown : Willie Grow arrives,
and the wai iter is told to politely or otherwise
shoo him off the premises. But the waiter mildly
remarks as he departs, that the youth is in am-
bush behind a huge bouquet with one of the ladies’
names on its flag. “Oh,” cries the girl, “show
! ” There ’s a lesson in a nutshell
to the bashful young man who feels that the only
way to approach his sacred divinity would be on
all-tours.
Women vvho hugger-mugger little sooty kittens
should be interested in the revelations at the
inquest on a woman found dead in a Sydney
suburb the other day. She, poor soul, lived alone
with a cherished black cat, and, when her body
wa,s discovered, puss was sitting on the pillow
licking her lips—and half her mistress’s face was
eaten away ! Isn’t it consoling to know that the
purring lump of fur which nestles so confidingly on
your shoulder has all that up its sleeve should the
occasion arise ! Ugh !
After all, there’s in “ animals ” very little senti-
ment—as well-fed humans understand the word,
borne years ago, a great outcry was made over the
inhumanity of a trooper, in the Mount Browne
district of N.S.W., who shot a faithful dog which
he had found beside the body of its dead master,
on a thirsty track. The dog had so obstinately
refused to allow the constable to approach the
poor bushman s cold clay that nothing remained
but to kill it, explained the officer. This explana-
tion was, however, deemed quite insufficient,
whereupon the trooper added, by way of post-
senpt: And I have further to report that the
l,° g rn , P artlal] y eaten deceased.” Whereupon
the lobyphiles shut up with a loud click.
The first of Rev. Charles Clark’s final appear-

“A subscription-ball run by the Govt. House
people proved irresistible, and even the meanest of
the mean forked out their 12s. 6d. to buy a ticket
from His Ex.’s daughter or an English lord.
The ball was very well done in every way, and
was absolutely crammed with members of the
upper-crust and would-be society folk; in fact,
Prahran Town Hall could well have been twice as
Bright Mrs. Freeman-Thomas “ran the
show,” from designing the very swell decorations,
all red drapery, deer and fox heads, mirrors, and
saddles, stirrups, whips, bridles, &c., &c., to
marching young men up in autocratic fashion
and presenting them to the ladies. The
gowns were gorgeous, and powder and patches
made pretty women look prettier, and alas ! plain
women plainer. All the vice-regal woinenkind
were poudre, and sported the latest London fad :
a black velvet band round the throat, of course in
their case covered with diamonds. Champagne,
&c., said to be provided by Mrs. Freeman-Thomas
and Mrs. Everard Brown, simply flowed, as was
convincingly proved by the unsteady gait of some
of the men towards the end of the evening.
''The Govt. House hop could not compare for
brilliancy with the Hunt Club ball; indeed, the
former was not quite so grand an affair as the pre-
vious gathering at the stucco mansion. There
was nothing very particular about the affair ex-
cepting some exceedingly swell gowns and plenty
of diamonds. Lady B. was fairly ablaze. The
only innovation was the apparatus for warming
the room, i.e., a large asbestos stove among the
ferns on either side of the dais, which soon made
the atmosphere too hot, and doors and windows
perforce were opened, letting in uncomfortable
blasts of frosty air. Supper was on from 11 o’clock,
and it was quite a sight to see crowds of uni-
formed men and bejewelled dames waiting for
half-an-hour at a time like hungry animals at the
barrier. H.E. wore white satin knee-breeches
and much gold-laced coat, and the warbling earl,
•i° i las burned from the country, delighted the
girls by appearing in his gorgeous uniform.
“ There has been great excitement below stairs
in local mansions whose mistresses had re-
ceived invitations from Guv’ment ’Ouse for a
man and maid to be present at the vice-regal ser-
vants’ ball. Of course, these invitations caused
much heart-burning, for many a maid had to go
with another girl’s flame, her own not being a gen-
tleman’s gentleman or house-servant.
. An ultra-smart ‘ society ’ journal surpassed all
its previous efforts recently by publishing a full
account of a wedding just five days before the
ceremony took place, causing no end of embarrass-
ment to the fair bride.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Sundry English professionals engaged to play
against the Australians last Monday struck on Friday
for higher wages, and Sydney Telegraph remarked
that the proceeding, though right in itself, was “ inoppor-
tune —they ought to have struck a week earlier. Natu-
rally they should. Then the cricket authorities would
have had 10 days in which to fill their places, and their
chance of success would have amounted to about as much
as the chance of the emu habitually taking to paper
collars. The principal boss of Sydney D.T. is also chair-
man of the ’bus co., and, on this occasion, the paper was
possibly thinking of a ’bus-drivers’ strike and the
expediency of same being so conducted as to give the boss
10 days or more to fill the vacancies. The other people
think that the right time to strike is when there is a
chance of success, and that time is when the boss person
needs them badly and hasn’t time to replace them. If
they don’t strike then, what is the good of doing it at all?
A general doesn’t usually give the enemy 10 days’notice
that he is going l to attack ; he comes along in the most
beastly inopportune way he can, and the man who is
most inopportune is the best general. A strike is indus-
trial war, and the art of being inopportune is the only
thing about strike-management worth knowing.
Editor Bulletin. —Will you allow me, the
cricket scribe who “ tries to excuse English defeats,” and
who comments on the comparative slowness of Australian
batting, to inform your angry correspondent that I argue
from figures, not prejudice. Your A.C’s had better study
this season s records of inter-county matches in England
and thereby convince themselves that the counties 1 ! as a
rule, score much faster against one another than the Aus-
tralians score against them. Your correspondent, “ Aus-
tralian,” cites three games out of some 20 odd in’which
the English batting has seemed to be slow. Of these
three games, that between Notts and Australia was the
only one commenced on a good wicket, and Notts—fre-
quently instanced by The Bulletin as the dullest of
English batting elevens—played with poor spirit cer-
tainly. As regards the cable that “ Surrey took all day
making 283 runs, whereas the Australians scored 376 for
their day,” what are the facts of the case ? The wicket
when Surrey opened the match was “heavy, owing to
recent rains.” So recent were the rains that play had to
be postponed for a time. The score at lunch-time indi-
cated as much to anyone not blinded by patriotic preju-
dice. Next day the wicket must have recovered from the
dampness, or the cable would have stated otherwise. The
cable reports are like your correspondent, “ Australian ”
One word more. Will “ Australian ” bet long odds that
Trott didn’t actually win the toss in that match and send
Surrey in first to bat upon the dead wicket? I don’t
think he would care to make a wager. Better to wait and
see when full details come to hand. And if Trott didn’t
win the toss against Surrey, it was the only time he has
lost it, out of eleven successive spins, up to the time of
writing. The good luck of the Australians throughout
then present tour hus, I lntiiiitiiin, been not less rem&rk-
able than their good play.— The Culprit Scribe.

Musgrove and “ Our Boys,” wasn’t much struck by the
improvements in London since he left it about 15 years
ago. Birmingham, Manchester, and other manufacturing
towns are dirtier than ever ; so he will be glad to get back
to Australia. Long association with the Firm’s theatrical
business has blunted the tall young man’s appetite for
nee admission to the’alls and other places which seen]

true ana mostly misrepresentation. The fussy secretary
of the M.C.C. did get bowler Trott put aside for a while
on the second day, but the University men resented this
interference and insisted on the Australian resuming the
attack. On the third day they had 507 runs to make.

A match between Warwickshire and Leicester-
shire counties, played in June, gives a fair idea of their
inferiority to the Australians. The two teams finished
neck and neck, Warwickshire making 477 altogether, and
Leicestershire pipping them when the last man in had
knocked up an unexpected 46. Three individual scores
of a century” were made, two of them by Warwick
shire smiters, though Woodcock, bowling for the winners
had a total average of 11 wickets for 141. Neither county
showed any such brilliant performances against the Aus-
tralians, who beat them both easily.
When The Bulletin went to press the third
test-match had been practically left to be decided on the
second innings. The English won the toss, and the first
wicket (Grace s) fell at 54. The score stood at 69 for one
wicket when stumps were drawn on the first day (play
did not begin till late, owing to rain); yet the innings
closed for 145. The Australians did even worse, for after
losing one wicket (Iredale’s) for 75, all were out for 119
ihe hero of the occasion was Hearne, who clean-bowled
five wickets for next to no runs.
* * * *
Sussex may get a tidy score against Australia,
with the aid of the two foreigners, Kanji and Murdoch,
also Bean and others. But the county bowling is not
strong enough to bring off a victory under ordinary
circumstances. Now that Surrey has failed to get rid of
Irott & Co. for a small sum, the latter seem invincible in
district matches.

in athletic sports is to a great extent “cheek” and
cocksure self-esteem.

A new tyre has been patented in Melbourne in
which the inner tube is divided into a number of separate
sections each about an inch long. Claimed that in the
event of two or three sections puncturing the tyre will
still be rideable. A price was offered locally for the patent
rights, but the inventor talks of taking it ’Ome to the
Dunlop Co., who have probably been working the same
line of idea. The section-tyre scheme is a first cousin to
the nautical system of water-tight compartments.

The Rover people were not long matching
Megson and Co. against a team representing an opposi-

the,v didn t secure a single place, while, on the second
day, Ernie Payne managed to struggle into third place in
each event. As Parlbv, who won all the events, is not a
.top-notcher, it would at first appear that the Australians
were clean outclassed ; but a more feasible explanation is
that they were not in their best form, as shown by the
position occupied by Lewis —last —in a slow-run five miles.
A letter from Payne shows that they cannot have been
more than four or five weeks in training.

Not a few Sydney tote-shops are booming ahead
—advertising straight-out backing, 2s. 6d. and ss. tote,
and doubles—under a false sense of security. The fact
that they have not lately been molested by the police
must not be taken as a guarantee for the future. As a
matter of fact, it is hinted in official circles that a big
swoop may be shortly expected, and that conviction will
mostly mean gaol. And the raid will probably not follow
any previous intimation to shut up under pain of arrest,
but will take place simultaneously at almost every recog-
nised tote-shop in town.

THE FRASER RAILWAY AUTOMATIC
DOOR-CONTROLLER.
THE LATEST AUSTRALIAN INVENTION.
As Mr. R. A. Fraser is proceeding to London via
America in a few days for the purpose of introduc-
ing his valuable invention to the administrators of
the English and continental railways, a brief des-
cription of the appliance may prove interesting to
Bulletin readers. The chief points which Mr.
Fraser claims for his invention are the following :
1. Economy : When the system is introduced the
present 3taff of suburban or platform porters will
be reduced to a minimum. [The late Chairman of
the Victorian Railways Commission estimated
that the yearly saving in this direction in the
province of Victoria would amount to from .£25,000
to .£30,000 on the suburban lines alone.] 2. The
saving of time : All the doors of a train of carriages
being opened and closed simultaneously. 3. The
saving of compensation for crushed limbs and
other accidents incidental to the old system. 4.
Absolute safety to the travelling public, and
largely increased convenience. The invention,
controlled by the guard from his van, is worked by
compressed air. The guard is able to manipulate
all the doors of all the carriages composing a train.
He can open and shut them, latch or unlatch
them, and lock or unlook them, and can also indi-
cate to the passengers the name of the station
which the train may be approaching. The dura-
tion of stoppages, and the names of the stations
intersecting with branch lines, may also be shown
on the indicators, to which the attention of the
passengers is drawn by a gong. The gong is also
sounded when the doors are opened, closed, or
locked. Trains may travel with the doors latched
and locked, or unlocked, as may be desired. #

The compromise by
which Mrs. Langtry
lately received £lO,O0 u
from the bank for her
stolen jewels, hides what
might have been one of
the most interesting cases
of modern times. _ The
true history attaching to
each of those jewels, if
ever it is told, will be
stock-in-trade for half-a-
dozen Ouidas. The ro-
mance in the life of Lily
Le Breton long antedates
her appearance on the
stage. Her beautiful
mother gave Jersey gos-
sips a never-ending theme
by her platonic fondness
for male society, and the
fine old dean loved his
female parishioners and
his handmaiden —- parti-
cularly his handmaiden —
and there was trouble
about a cook. The dean
resigned. The writer met
the old veteran —a Henry
Parkes in build, white
hair included, but better-
featured walking dis-
consolate in .Rotten Row,
London. Later, he sent
one of the most extraor-
dinary letters on record
to his old churchwardens,
and it was published in
the St. Heliers press. He
begged forgiveness for his
past errors and
promised “that
never in the fu-
ture should they
have the same
cause of com-
plaint as in the
past.” He was
taken back. Of
Mrs. Langtry’s
brothers, one

historically
disagr e e d

on a matter of
accounts; one was
fatally chewed by a tiger
in India, and the young-
est was killed while
steeplechasing. There is
yet another brother, an officer in the British
army. Before his marriage Mr. Langtry was
a wealthy man, and visited Jersey in his
yacht, the Red Gauntlet. Here he met and
married the beautiful Miss Price, a schoolfellow
of Miss Le Breton. Lily was one of the brides-
maids. In the honeymoon spent on the yacht the
young wife caught cold and, later, died of con-
sumption. Twelve months after Mr. Langtry re-
turned to St. Heliers and married Miss Le Breton,
who at that time was far from being noticeably
beautiful; she was scraggy.

John Plummer, whose industry as the
“ Voice of the People,” “Pro Bono Publico,” and

the N.S.W. country papers, owing, presumably,
to the paucity of funds belonging to the National
Ass, is literary henchman to the N.S.W. Railway
Commissioners. The recent arrival of the Co-
operative delegates in Australia is a great feather
in Plummer’s cap, as the visit is partly
due to his indefatigable pegging away in the
English Co-Operative News. Plummer began
his literary career when a weaver working at the
loom, and for years acted as London correspondent
of the S.M. Herald.

such public profession. But Jacob is not
the first Minister to indulge in this holy
slang. The present writer heard another N.S.W.
Minister use almost the same words, with a slight
difference in the years of his “ conversion ’’-and
afterwards, alas ! read in the press that the godly
one had been sentenced to a Jtretch of hard labor
in gaol.

Mr. B. A. FRASER, Melb., inventor of the Fraser
Railway Automatic Door Controller.
Sydney Bankruptcy Court item, under
“ Public Examinations” Be Armand Jerome.
Bankrupt did not appear, and the examination
was adjourned sine die.” No, he does not appear.
Mr. R. A. Fraser, of Melb., whose portrait
is published herewith, appears fated to win
“wealth with honor” as the inventor of the
railway automatic door-controller which bears his
name. His evolution from bank-clerk to success-
ful mechanical inventor is sufficiently singular to
attach interest to the personality of the man who
seems about to scale Fortune’s ladder at the early
age of 28. It was Mr. Fraser’s father . who
secured the initial success of antimony mining
many years ago at Costerfield (Vic.), and much of
his enthusiasm and industry has obviously de-
scended to his son. Fraser fils was educated at
Btawell (Vic.) grammar school, and at the age of
18 entered the service of the Bank of Victoria in
that town. After six years’ experience of ledgers
and overdrafts the weary clerkling retired from the
bank, in order to devote himself fully to his in-
vention. From the germ of the idea, which
originated 10 years ago, Mr. Fraser has now per-
fected his unique patent. He proceeds to London
in a few days, with every hope of securing its
adoption on the British and continental railways.
The accompanying illustrations depict the
latest success in bicycle development. The improve-
ment of the driving mechanism of a bicycle is a
problem on which much mechanical genius has
been focussed. And the “Metropole,” by the
substitution of cog-wheels and shaft for chain gear,
claims to have made a very long step for-
ward. Mr. Eden, the well-known Sydney
photographer, is “ Metro pole ” agent for
all Australia, bar S.A. and Westralia. He
points out that the mechanism, being of the
finest steel, and preserved in a hermetic-
ally-sealed case, will last several years,
whereas the chain-gear has to be replaced
every 12 months. The Military and Post
and Telegraph Departments of the French
Government adopted the Acatene Metro-
pole because of its strength, rigidity, light-
ness and speed. The manufactory employs
3000 hands, and its existence is a boom.
Rivffire, the French crack, rode a Metro-
pole when he ran second to Linton in the
367-mile race from Bordeaux to Paris. Mr.
Eden hasasamplemachineathis studio, and
is booking orders daily for expected ship-
ments, which will arrive a few weeks hence.

gone to see the present Government on the subject
and a report was called for.. The report stated
that the figure Was appropriately draped, yet he
had been told that on one occasion at least the ,
figure was naked. This was one of the things "
which the Government should put down. ’ The

to the N.S.W. pension-list, the amounts payable
running from £2B to £545 per annum.
After the recent Brunswick (Vic.) Orange-
Green riots several large employers on both sides
dismissed a number of their hands on account of
their “color.”
Westralia’s chief inspector of stock : “We
have not now a single scabby sheep.” The inspec-
tor, of course, meant four-footed animals, and
wasn’t thinking of the local Mines Department.
SENTIMENT UNDER DIFFICULTIES.
SHE: “ What! don’t you love me in my bicycle
suit? ”
HE: “ Oh, it’s all right now—but at first it was a
bit like kissing a fellow."
The new Vic. United Labor-party very
rightly recognises that the referendum is a corol-
lary of elective Ministries, and finds prominent
places for both these issues in its announced
policy.
In British Parliamentary papers up to
date, imports from British colonies have always
been classed among “foreign,” but for “silken
bonds” purposes they are in future to be classed
by themselves.
The story goes that a N.S.W. Minister,
who has had a State bedroom fitted up for himself
in his departmental offices, sleeps luxuriously
there between sheets purchased with the people’s
money at £2 12s. per pair.
Parties are so evenly balanced in S. A. Leg.
Council that the Govt, finds great difficulty in
passing liberal measures. Next April there will
be eight retirements. Big political events depend
upon the voting on that occasion.
One member of N.S.W. Parliament is said
to own five public-houses. Although local option
ranks as a question of public policy, it is indecent
for a man who owns even one public-house to
speak or vote in Parliament against any form of
liquor restriction bill.
King O’Malley, M.P., is making heroic
endeavors to be taken seriously by S.A. people,
press, and politicians, but so far his presence in
Parliament is looked upon as a huge practical
joke. It is satisfactory to know that his vote is
always given on the Radical side.
The Reid Govt, has finally decided that no
special consideration can be extended to the
N.S.W. sugar-growers, and the duty will come off
by instalments as already arranged. As a Free-
trade Govt, it couldn’t do anything else; so an-
other big industry is taking a bee-line for Tophet.
Sydney D.T. says now that, three months
ago, it pointed out that the test year of the N.S.
Wales Freetrade Treasurer’s finance would be
1896-7, and could not by any possibility be taken
as 1895-6. Then why did the D.T., with all the
other local Foreign-trade organs, whoop hifalutins
on Reid’s alleged surplus three or four weeks ago?
The Victorian conference of trades and
labor organisations has made “ the election of
Ministers by Parliament ” a plank in the Labor
platform of the Cabbage Garden. Another of its
planks is “the abolition of the Legislative Council.”
This last is as yet so debateable a question among
Labor’s own friends that it will seriously militate
against the acceptance of the Vic. Labor-policy as
a whole.
Caldwell, M.L.A., of South Australia : “I
believe the best body to govern this colony would
be one, of which half was chosen by the British
bondholders, and the other half elected to repre-
sent the best interests of the colony.” The best
interests of S.A., according to Caldwell, are, of
course, sheep, boiling-down establishments, land-
jobs and land-grant shyndikits. The best in-
terests ! !
Old Jock M‘lntyre, Vic. Opposition leader,
has an idea for squaring the finances. If the rail-
way deficit was out of the way there would be a
big surplus. Therefore, MTntyre proposes that
the railway deficit be simply added to the public
debt every year, and that the province shall then
proceed to have a real good time. The Australian
financiers who see their way to do something
great by whooping up the public debt are too
many to count.
Tasmania really doesn’t know this year
whether its Parliament is open or not. When the
Governor went through the usual ceremony he
quite forgot to wind up with the usual remark:
“I now declare this Parliament open,” and deep
legal persons with horse-hair wigs are somewhat
worried about the situation. If the Gov. didn’t
really open Parliament, can it be open ? And if
it can be open without him opening it, then what
is the use of him opening it at all ?
Raid’s latest charge against the Protec-
tionists is copied from a very old stage device of
Parkes, and is labelled—“ Slandering the fair
fame of this country in the eyes of the world. ”
As nobody cares particularly about the fair fame
of this country except the British money-lender,
the real inwardness of the charge—also of the
alleged surplus— must be to facilitate a loan in the
usual quarters.
When Premier Reid rounds on
ex-Treasurer M‘Millan in terms of
fine scorn for base betrayal of his
party, and for harassing their flanks
with alarums and incursions, he
seems to forget that some four short
summers ago he stood in precisely
the same position towards Parkes
and M‘Millan. Then he worried
them from behind, and rounded
them up, and bustled them. Now
the perky, ready M‘Millan has re-
versed the position of affairs, and
seems determined to avenge himself
and his dead chief by hovering
around and cutting-off all stragglers,
burning Reid’s bridges, and confis-
cating his surpluses. It was Parkes’
legacy to M‘Mi]lan ; and, whatever
may be said of the death-bed re-
conciliation of Reid and Parkes,
the old warrior’s taunt still lives:
“ If they wanted another captain,
there was no necessity to put a
pirate in my place ! ”
It reads curiously in the Syd-
ney shipping reports: “July 24,
Fifeshire, steamer, from London, 62
bags corn, 1200 packages flour,” &c.
Again, ‘ ‘ Bungaree, steamer, from
London, 934 bags flour.” And then,
“ Indraghiri, steamer, from Lon-
don, 1754 bags flour.” Under the
festering influence of Foreign-trade
it actually seems that the great,
rich, new country of N.S.W. is
beginning to depend on England for the com-
monest varieties of agricultural produce.
The shrewd old miner known to history,
who listened to the debates of eminent theologians
and always knew who got the best of it, because
the other fellow lost his temper, would have had
no difficulty, the other evening, in discovering the
winner of the Reid-M‘Millan controversy if he
had watched the former tearing passion to tatters,
while Mac sat with a still, cold smile, a pale, calm
face, and arms folded over his breast —after having
demolished the Reidian system of finance.
Murray Smith, M.P., Vic. : “I distinctly
state it is not the duty of a Government to find
work for the people. It is the people that support
the Government.” Logic ! It is the duty of a
Government to do what the people darn well
please, since the Government is merely an instru-
ment of the people, but the pity is that people like
Mr. Smith have not been made to see that, because
of the weakness of the people in continuing to
support insupportable Governments. Smith is a
living proof of the proverb, “Everything is pos-
sible in a Democracy.”
Some S.A. Tories, in view of Way’s pos-
sible Privy Councillorship, are howling at the
prospect of Kingston succeeding him as Chief
Justice. Such a contingency is looked upon as
impossible by all who know the ambitious S.A.
Premier, who gave up a big legal practice for
politics, and would never sacrifice his political
prospects for the chill monotony of the Bench.
Yic. Legislative Council is
thinking of referring the Companies
Bill to a select committee which will
take the evidence of experts. This
will cut two ways. The experts are
the people who run companies or
manage or audit them, and as the bill
is to block all their profitable swin-
dles they will necessarily be against
it, and their evidence will furnish an
excuse for dropping the whole busi-
ness. Moreover, the experts will give
evidence for so many weeks that the
end of the session will probably come
while they are still at it, and then
Sargood and Co. will go to their con-
stituents and tell them that they
haven’t rejected the bill, but are stiff
toiling at it to make it perfect, and the
constituents will be so much pleased
that they will re-elect Sargood forth-
with.
R. T. Yale’s resignation from
the Turner (Vic.) Ministry is not to
be wondered at, seeing that he held
a payless portfolio, and had done
much of the Ministerial bullocking.
He was head and front of the com-
mittee that inquired minutely into
the working of departments, seeking
victims for the retrenchment knife,
and sniffing out extravagance and
abuses. He had a keen scent for
abuses, and did valuable Democratic
work, facing the opprobrium of the
“curled darlings,” and making
enemies of the right sort. The Govt,
has not grit to back him up, and
abolish the evils he exposed, so he
steps out, having done for nothing, in
one way or another, work for which
two Ministerial screws would only
have been a reasonable reward. Vale
is mostly real grit, only his close
association with the professional tea-
swillers and social-purity gad-abouts
keeps him from going up top in the
Vic. Radical party. The Demo-
cracy mistrusts a man when he has
got the anti-beer habit so bad that
his weakness verges on dipso-
mania.
The Adelaide R.O. clergy, alarmed at the
liberal political lines on which the Southern
Cross, their denominational organ, has been con-
ducted by managing-director O’Loghlin (Chief
Secretary), at the last half-yearly meeting suc-
ceeded in getting three priests and a sympathetic
layman elected on a board of six members to
modify the tone of the weekly—which, by the
way, on the year’s transactions paid 20. per cent,
div. Lands-Minister Gillen is the sixth director.
The situation of the Bank of N.Z. in-
quiry, now being held at Wellington, is about
this : The Opposition wants to inquire into all
matters for about two years back so as to expose
the iniquitous wav ex-Treasurer Ward or his
Association let in the Colonial Bank. The Sed-
don Government wants to carry the inquiry back
to ’BB in order to expose also the way some promi-
nent Oppositionists, who are now dreadfully
shocked about Ward, let in the B.N.Z. for enor-
mous sums which were surreptitiously wiped off,
and which have been kept dark to this day. And
each Potts says that the other Slurk is trying to
smother investigation.
GOOD SALTING MATERIAL .
(A Tale of the Wild West.)
JACK : “ Gray and Yensen sold their claim to them newchums
for a decent figure; hadn’t you a better show?”
BILL : “ No. You see, Yensen’s false teeth was mounted with
gold, mine’s just celluloid.”
Been There: There is proportionately more
grog consumed in Mildura and Renmark, Aus-
tralia’s ‘ ‘ temperance ” colonies, than in the majority
of towns where licensed hotels flourish. And what
vile stuff some of the alleged whisky is, especially
that bought at the Renmark shanties ! One result
of the prohibition of open sale is that the whole of
the population seem sly and snaky, suspicious of
each other’s every action. The people are almost
unanimous in condemning the prohibition, but a
small minority obstructs alteration of the law.
Premier Reid has evidently been a close
student of Parkes’ political tricks. Success has
followed some of the weary old platitudes by
which “ national ” interests are assured on
their annual “ day out ” that he is with
them, though not of them —at an English affair
that he is proud of belonging to the great hempire
(Reid aspirates the “ h ”); at an Irish meeting
that if he hadn’t been something else he would
have had no hesitation in being proud of being an
Irishman ; and at a Scotch festival that an ances-
tress had a narrow escape of being married to
Bobby Burns.
Judge Williams (Vic.) points out that at
the conference of Judges held in Melbourne at the
time of the great Exhibition, he tabled a proposal
for the establishment of a Federal Court of Ap-
peal. Higinbotham, Way, and Boucaut ap-
plauded and supported the motion, but the Sydney
Judges were fierce in opposition, and the oppor-
tunity and the motion were lost.
A FRACTION
The Girl in Background (as the first couple hurry past)-.
“ Who is that with old Major Got dam ' ”
THE MAN : “ Oh, he married lately; that’s his better half,
you know.”
Anomalous that while the N.S.W. At-
torney-General may perform as much private
practice as he can get hold of, his secretary is not
permitted to do so. Is the secretary to the
Attorney-General, then, a “civil servant”? No.
There is no valid reason for his being differentiated
in this respect from the Attorney-General; it is
merely the glorifying habit of “ greasing the fat
sow.” The Attorney-General should not be per-
mitted to earn extra-official money by private
practioe, but then the Attorney-General should
not be a political office-holder at all, but a paid,
permanent servant of the State.
Premier Reid, in N.S.W. Assembly : “In
1892, when the Dibbs Government was in power
and spent <£11,000,000 of public money,” &c., &c.
According to Coghlan’s Statistical Register
(page 328) the net expenditure of ’92 was
■£9,931,411. So, unless Coghlan is very far astray,
Premier Reid stands convicted of meanly manu-
facturing figures and falsifying statistics to dis-
credit his predecessors. In fact, almost every time
G. Reid comes along with a batch of figures he is
bowled out in glaring and childish misrepresenta-
tions. Yet he comes along with the next batch
quite cheerfully as an individual whose accuracy is
beyond question.
The Queensland Boodle Government is
running the Federation question on Fat Man
principles all round. Not only has it omitted
from the Enabling Bill the provision that the
people are to elect the Convention delegates, but
also the clause providing that the proposed Federal
Constitution is to be accepted or rejected by a
popular vote. Consequently the Boodle Ministry
gets there in two separate ways. Its servile Par-
liamentary majority elects the delegates who will
help to draw up the Constitution. And the same
servile majority will accept or reject the Constitu-
tion when it is drawn up—will accept it if it is so
brutally Tory that it wouldn’t be safe to submit it
to a popular vote because the people would throw
it out, and reject it if it is so Liberal that there is
any chance of the people wanting to accept it. So
the people don’t get a look-in either way.
The N.S.W. railway-revenue for the year
just ended was <£109,000 short of working-expenses
and interest on the whole cost of construction.
The Vic. railway-deficit was nearly £600,000, and
the distracted Melb. legislator wants to know the
reason why.. Which reason sticks out so conspicu-
ously that his inability to see it is simply wonder-
ful. Vic. has four times more railway than N.S.W.
in proportion to area, and 25 per cent, more in
proportion to population—in fact, Vic. is a dread-
fully over-railwayed province. Moreover, things
are so arranged that nearly two-thirds of the
province hasn’t the semblance of a line anywhere,
while in the other third you can’t walk two miles
without stubbing your toe against a railway.
The railways are jammed together in the centre of
the province, and the rest of it is a howling wil-
derness.


Last N.A. Review points out that the
building-regulations of Paris, Berlin, and Vienna
prohibit sky-palaces in those cities, such as are
familiar in America and Australia. Not only is
height limited definitely, but it can never be more
than the breadth of the street.
Injections of blood-serum taken from an
ordinary healthy horse act as a most powerful
tonic ; the red corpuscles rapidly multiply, weight
is gained, and the patient becomes visibly stronger
daily. It is especially valuable in disorders of
nutrition and nervous troubles like St. Vitus
dance.

The Australian branches of the United
Type Writer and Supplies Co. are steadily reaping
a deserved reward with the Caligraph No. 4, Yost,
and Densmore typewriters. These machines gain
more and more public favor as Australians wake
up to the fact that to save time is to gain time.
The Westralian Governor has recently purchased
a Densmore for private use ; also a Yost. Call-

Zouroff would certainly have carried The
Bulletin s prediction into second or third place for
Caulfield G.N Steeplechase but for his blunder at the
last jump. The race at that point was confined to
Larrikin and Zouroff, the former appearing master of
the situation. When his nearest rival came to grief
Glasscock s horse was left with a very long lead, and he
cantered down the straight 30 lengths in front of old
Cerberus, who was about half as far ahead of the weary
Banjo. Larrikin, starting at “fives,” had been a street-
corner cert, during the week, and the public received him
graciously.
. .* * * *
Larrikin made record time for the V.A.T.C.
National Steeplechase, 4) seconds less than Daimio
registered last year with 321 b. more in the saddle
Daimio s, by the way, was 17 seconds faster than the
previous record, and yet the Hinglish critics are said to
sneer at the Australian champion. We shall see what we
shall observe in the cablegrams a few months hence
* * * *
Larrikin, Saturday s Oaulfield victor, has been
racing into form during the past month or so. The field
numbered 13, as usual. The winner, a descendant of
Panic, put up a record of B.ll£ for the 4 miles.
* * * *
S.M. Herald contends that Caulfield Steeple
should be reduced from 4 to 3 miles, on account of the
accidents. Its own report shows that the casualties
started at a mile and a-half. Yet the going was good and
the afternoon long.

Malwa and Madge Gordon, the best of the
bunch of saplings that started for the first flutter at
Oaulfield, were easily beaten by Emblazon last Saturday
This time the journey was 3£ furlongs, and the extra
110 yarns, perhaps, overtaxed their “staying power”
Malwa, certainly, carried a stone penalty for winning o ‘n
the first day, but 141 b. over such a course ought noit to
trouble even a young two-year-old.

A travelling trotter raced “nowhere” in M.L.
for months. When he won the runner-up proved that he
was a ringer, and got the stake and div. Subsequently
the disqualified owner found that the objector’s own horse
was “ rung in ” also. He is now wondering whether there
ts any honor among gentlemen of the push as asserted.

Australian bookmaker, Charley White who
died in London, the other week, had a funeral half-a-mile
long and “ floral tributes ” sufficient to decorate a whole
cemetery. That’s what comes of laying stiff ’uns for a

familiar trade-motto, “ I am here,” will presumably be
carved on his tombstone. J

Three desirable retirements from Melb. Cup

Equine demise : Haricot, winner of Melb Cup
’74. This race was a kind of fluke, Haricot bolting from
the field all the way round, just as Flying Buck did in the
first Champion. Many remember how the pigeons flew
up from the grand-stand with the news for the Werribee
homestead of the Chirnsides, who thenceforward took
loving care of the fitly-called son out of Saucepan by
Ladykirk, for such was the somewhat ambiguous name of

0. It was an unexciting demonstration, and only one
man got hurt. It is quite possible that the losers will
make a much better stand in the challenge match against
Randwick this week, and that either of the teams will
down Wentworths later in the proposed charity-match.
Anything is liable to happen in Rugby.

ENGLISH PRESS NOTICES.
“At his best he compares not unfavorably with the
author of ‘ Barrack-Room Ballads.’ ” —The Times.
“ He shows real poetical power.”—Pall Mall Gazette.
“ These lines have the true lyrical cry in them. Elo-
quent and ardent verses.”—Spectator.
“ It has the saving grace of humor ; a deal of real laugh-
ter and a dash of real tears.”—The Scotsman.
“We turn to Mr. Paterson’s roaring muse with instan-
taneous gratitude.”—Literary Herald.
“ The poet has also a note of pathos, which is always
wholesome.” —Glasgow Herald.
“Thematerial is new as the treatment is artistic.”—
Black and White.
“ True poetical spirit, keen observation, and a capital
swing of metre in this interesting volume.”—Manchester
Courier.
“ Mr. Paterson can produce charming poetry in sweet
and natural language.”—North British Advertiser.
“ This book would be a capital companion on a holiday
trip, for the epithet ‘dull’ cannot be applied to a single
line of it.” —Western Daily Press.
“ But Australia has produced in Mr. A. B. Paterson a
national poet, whose bush ballads are as distinctly charac-
teristic of the country as Burns’ poetry is characteristic of
Scotland.” —Westminster Gazette.

Unable to Work!

COULD NOT SLEEP!
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
COMPLETELY CURED HIM.
Blr. T. J. Clune, o£ Walkerville, Ade-
laide, South Australia, writes:
“Six years ago, I had an attack of
Indigestion and Liver Complaint
that lasted for weeks ; I was unabi'e
to do any hard work, had no appe-
tite, food distressed me, and I suf-
fered much from headache. My
skin was sallow and sleep did not
refresh me. I tried several reme-
dies and consulted a doctor, with-
out obtaining any relief; finally,
one of my customers recommended
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. It helped me
from the first,—in fact, after taking
six bottles I was completely cured,
and could eat anything and sleep
like a child.”

R.C. writes: ‘‘ lie the current literary
endeavor to bring the R.CS. doctrine of Purgatory
‘in close touch ’ with the Theosophical theory of
re-incarnation. In Purgatory the soul, it is held,
can do nothing for itself ; in the theory of re-
incarnation the soul, by its own acts, can make
itself better or worse. Surely there is no possi-
bility of ‘ touch ’ between two such theories.”

In the matter of ornamental front-names,
there are signs amongst the ultraristoeracy of a
reaction towards the simplest; due, doubtless, to
the fact that appellations which used to be dis-
tinctly gilt-edged have passed, by way of London-
Journal literature,' so largely into the nomencla-
tui’eof the lick-spittle bourgeoisie, that ‘ ‘ before long,
begad, sir ! —for a plain Mary or Margaret ; for a
simple Jack, or Tom, or Harry —you’ll have to
come to us, sir—to us 1 ” But Blueblood feels that
there is balm in Gilead, after all—when, with
a sleeve - contained grin, it contemplates such
pleasing combinations as “Algernon Snooks,” or
“ Percy Plantagenet Gubbins,” or “ Gladys
Ermyntrade Blogg.”
The buyer of the unused half of a return-
ticket has not al ways the best of the deal. Re-
cently a Sydney man travelled from Melbourne to
Sydney, by steamer, on a doctor’s ticket bought
cheap. He was called up in the middle of the
night, when the boat was pitching dreadfully, by
three distracted women, to attend to a sick baby.
He prescribed for the infant at random ; but what
a pickle there would have been had it been—well,
another sort of case ! Confess you were not Dr.
• , and be dubbed an impostor and a spieler,
and be socially ostracised for the remainder of the
voyage, with the risk of arrest thrown in ? or
tackle the case and perform a horrid murder on
the trusting patient ? The agony, the fear of ex-
posure, the ever-present thought that some sailor
would break his leg and that you would be asked
to attend, discounted by a long way the apparent
cheapness of the ticket.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
Dear Bulletin, — lie “H.F’s” sound de-
duction that, if the Cold-Tea assertions were true,
every alcohol-bibbing race would long ago have
petered-out, there are lots of other cases in which
hygienic theory can’t look fact in the face for a
moment. If washing the skin, for instance, is of
the fundamental importance claimed for it, how
account for the vigorous health of the Samoyed,
who never touches water, except through a capsize
of his lcayak? Also, if fresh air is the health-
essential it is cracked up to be, how do the Germans
—who religiously exclude it from their sleeping-
rooms—manage to remain the robustest race in
Europe ? Then there’s the opium-bogey. I have
lived where seven-eighths of the population habi-
tually and regularly used the drug, and yet there
wasn’t amongst them one opium-wreck for a dozen
drink-wrecks amongst ourselves. I don’t say these
discrepancies are inexplicable; but I can’t fix ’em
up.—A.M.

To Herr Rassmussen,
Proprietor of the Alfaline Remedies.
Dear Sir, —It gives me great pleasure to inform
you that I have .derived great benefit from your
celebrated Alfaline Remedies during my explor-

Mr. Button writes later: —“The Pills I had
from you were of great benefit to me and others.
In one case, when three hunters and trappers

the Rose River, one was taken very ill ; his mates
intended taking him in a waggon to Wangaratta
(about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor. I
gave him a few of your Pills. lam pleased to
inform you that having to pass their camp next
day, I found him up and pegging-out his skins
and looking well. This speaks volumes for your
valuable Remedies.”

know how to thank you enough. Dear Sir, I

Skin and Blood Cured,
Canning Mills, Canning, Western Australia.
To Herr Rassmussen,
I am pleased to inform you that your Alfaline
Lock Cure Pills completely cured me of a very
bad disease. Previous to taking your Lock Pills,
I was under the treatment of a doctor for six
weeks, but was getting no better; and I shall
never regret trying your Alfaline Pills, as they
had a wonderful effect on my complaint, which
several of my work-mates can testify to. I have
recommended your Alfaline Herbal Remedies to
several of my friends, who have reason to be very
grateful for it, and I shall always do my best to
recommend them to any fellow sufferers. You
are authorised to publish this testimonial.
Yours gratefully, J. NERVIN.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 18711 was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.
Witness : Edward Hardy, proprietor Town
Hall Coffee Palace, 521 George-street.

a sufferer from General Debiiity of the Nervous
System for over seven years, and having tried
without success several of the leading doctors
both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did
so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most
happy to recommend your remedies to anyone
suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which
you have treated me, allow me to say that you
can make what use you may think proper of this.

THE LAST OF SIX.”
Out in the backblocks the proud proprietor
of the “ Travelling Emporium of the Great
American Trading Association ” had drawn up his
waggon by the wayside to camp for the night, a
number of the ideal youths having deciphered
to the best of their collective ability, the gaudy
inscriptions on the tilt, were inspired with a laud-
able thirst for more extended geographical know-
ledge, and accordingly deputed their leader o
“ have a pitch with the bloke. Inspired y
muddiness of the waggon-wheels, the spokesman
ventured to “ ’spose that the road between here
and ‘ Ameriky ’is pretty bad. (< Waal, gravely
responded the interviewed, I reckon, .young
fellar, it’s a bit rough now and again m bad

A GRAND LITERARY INSTITUTION.
Cole’s Book Arcade now runs from the centre
of the block in Bourke-street to the centre of the

and contains the following 17 departments, mostly
literary and artistic: 1, New Books ; 2, Second-
hand Books ; 3, Stationery; 4, Music ; 5, 1 ancy

11, a Japanese Exhibition ; 12, a Wonderland ;
13, a Smiling Gallery; 14, a Childs Picture

17, a splendidly arranged new Wholesale Book
Department, containing half-a-million books. Ihe
mam walks of the establishment are half-a-mile
long.*
In one large city retail warehouse the
manager is engaged on the understanding that he
realises a certain profit every week—if the profit
isn’t there he gets ‘ ‘ the run. ” As business is none
too good there have consequently been tour
managers in about as many months. three ot
them lasted one week each, and the fourth, a per-
son of great business capacity, has filled m the
rest of the time. But he has had several narrow
escapes. One week the profit was a shilling or two
short, and it was within one minute of closing
time on the last night, but a tired girl-assistant
was fined ss. on a general charge of neglect
and incompetence, and that squared the accounts.
Next week, when the energetic proprietor took
stock, one pair of stockings was missing, and
as the value of them came off the profits there
seemed a chance that they would again fall just
below the limit. But the man in charge was
again equal to the occasion. He placed himselt
in a chair and solemnly stood the girl up ra front
of him. Then he informed her, in an awful voice,
that her iniquity had come to light, and that he
had at first intended to give her m custody tor
stealing the stockings, but on further consideration
hehad relented. Therefore he would merely deduct
them from her wages and discharge her there and
then, and presently a distressed female with a
balance of eighteenpence in her hand was cast into
the street.
At one large warehouse where discipline is un-
usually strict—discipline, as the term is under-
stood in the softgoods business, generally consists
in fiming everybody from 3d. up to 2s. bd. at short
intervals, and warning them in a deep voice not to
do it again—a large person in a tail-coat is kept
apparently for detective purposes. When the
periodical customer comes to say that something
she ordered was not sent, or something was sent
which she didn’t order, this individual backs ; her
into a chair and bows profoundly. “ Madam, he
says, “can you describe the young person who
served you ? ” She describes the young person,
and the inquisitor dives into the abysses of the
premises and returns leading the most likely-look-
ing young person by the wrist in custody, and
formally produces her for inspection. Madam,
he says in an awful voice, and with a withering
glance at the prisoner, “ is this the young person
who served you ? ” The proceedings are so awful
that it is quite obvious that if this is the young
person she will be immediately taken into the
cellar and executed, so if the customer has any
compassion in her she generally says it was fill 1 ’ 3 ®
a different young person, and goes away. But
sometimes there is a look of recognition m her eye,
and then the young person is generally fined on
suspicion.

Increase your yields by Saving the Fine Gold
and Pyrites by the use of
Wynne and Tregurtha’s
JPatent Battery Plates.
This Invention, lately patented, revolutionises the ordi-
nary battery treatment of ores, for by its use copper-
plates, quicksilver, and chemicals are entirely dispensed
with The Wynne and Tregurtha Patent Battery Plates
are made of iron, cast with peculiarly-shaped ribs. They
are fitted in a wooden frame, and take the place of the
ordinary copper-plates and blanket tables. The tailings
on leaving the stamper boxes pass over the plates which,
from their construction, catch the fine gold P y ns ?
allowing the sand and water to flow away. When the
plates are fully charged with the concentrates they are
then tilted backwards by means of a lever, throwing the
contents into a trough underneath. In practical use
much better results have been obtained by these plates
than by the ordinary copper ones, the yield of gold being
increased by fully 10 per cent. Excellent results have
been achieved in the treatment of refractory ores, whore
the gold is associated with some foreign mineral, which
has proved deleterious to the mercury and causing the
loss of the gold. The plates are strong, simple in con-
struction, and easily handled, and can be obtained from

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The clay was cold and dull and gray.
The long, white hospital-ward, studded with
cots, suggested, in that murky light, a catacomb •
filled with dead: with dead, chill, still, but yet
cognizant—dead awaiting judgment.
1,1 The mute, black-robed, and ever-flitting nurses
might have been attendant ghouls.
* * * *
Around one of the beds at the far end of
the ward a screen was drawn —that hospital screen,
on which might with grim appropriateness be
written the legend above the doors of Dante’s
Inferno.
“It is just nine o’clock. Were his an ordinary
case, I’d give him two hours to live, perhaps less ;
but not a minute longer.”
“ Do you think he will last longer, then, sir?”
queried the senior assistant of the chief surgeon.
“Well, poor wretch, he has something on his
mind— something that won’t let him die until he
tells it. And the power to tell it is apparently
gone.”
They crossed the ward, moved the screen a
little, and stood by the side of the bed, looking
down upon the occupant.
He who lay there was so old and deathly pallid,
so attenuated and helpless, that he might have
been deemed already dead, save for the strange
and lurid light blazing in his sunken eyes and the
awful look of expectancy on his shrivelled face-
such an appalling aspect of hope deferred as might
be worn by some damned soul, catching, through
the open gates of purgatory, a glimpse of the
portals of unattainable Paradise.
“Are you in much pain?” said the chief, in
business-like, but yet kindly tone.
The dying man replied only with a faint move-
ment of his eyebrows, which might have been
intended to mean— “No.”
The doctor glanced at the card at head of the
cot. “Religion, Church of England,” he mur-
mured. Then :
“ Would you like to see a clergyman ? ”
The unmistakeable shadow of contempt which
flitted athwart the sick man’s face was sufficient
negative.
“A lawyer or a magistrate? ”
He pursed his lips.
“No ! ” said the doctor. “ Then, is there any-
thing you’d like to tell me? You’re dying, you
know, my poor fellow. You can’t live two hours.”
A miracle happened.
“ I shan’t— bloomin’ —well—die—till —I know!
this man, who had been speechless for hours,
gasped.
“Know what?”
“ Garn ! ” said the patient with his lips, through
which, however, issued no further words, but only
the labored sobs of the outpaced, fainting runner.
* * * *
“ What a wretched physique, and yet what
marvellous tenacity of life ! ” remarked the assist-
ant as he and his chief paced softly up the ward.
“Yes,” said the other; “he’s a city product.
. He could never have walked three miles in any
one day of his life, or taken part in any exercise
requiring the slightest athleticism or endurance.
He nevfer had a musoular system, so to speak ; his
very bones have always been soft. ITe must have
been an old man from the day of his birth, and
he’s probably smoked and chewed some cwts. of
tobacoo, though his age, I see, is set down as 2b. ’
As the two medical men left the ward a
nurse drew near the dying man. He interrogated
her with terrible eyes.
“ No news yet,” she said.
Two hours passed. The man still lived. The
nurse approached his bed from time to time and
shook her head. Three hours ! He was alive.
His eyes still glittered with unholy fire. He was,
if possible, weaker than ever.
One o’clock ! The nurse, with much excitement
in her face, came swiftly to the bedside, bent
down, and whispered:
“In another hour. At two ! ”
* * * *
The chimes sounded from the. great tower
of Sydney Post-office. There was silence; then,
ponderously, the big clock struck :
One ! Two !
The dying man raised himself—actually raised
himself and sat up without assistance; he who
had stirred neither hand nor foot for weeks. It
was a resurrection—the resurrection of a long-dead
and galvanised corpse.
“ Shift—the —blanky screen ! ” he said ; “ lemme
—larf—at—that—big puddin’-’eaded Englishman
—next cot! ”
The nurse moved the screen. At that moment
there was a confused murmur at the entrance to
the ward, which swelled into a wild babble of
voices in which nurses and semi-moribund patients
alike joined.
Then, shrill and clear above all the others, a
voice—
“ The Australians have won the second test-
match / ”
The man who had waited raised himself—
higher—higher—until he almost stood in bed. He
transfixed with his unearthly eyes the burly Eng-
lishman in the next cot.
“ Yah, yah ! ” he said and fell over—stark and
dead. A light holy, sweet and tender, such as
might have been seen on the features of a saint,
seemed to irradiate his face —no longer the face of
an aged man, but of a wizened baby.
* * * ♦
“ Lived till two, did he ? ” said the doctor
next day.
“Yes, sir. He was only waiting to hear the
result of the test-match.”
“Very natural —quite proper ! What was he? ”
“The champion Sydney barracker, sir.”
J. EVISON.
The Maoriland papers tell a story about a
party of Druids who were driving home to Porirua
from a meeting of the Pahautanui Lodge or some-
thing, and, mistaking the light on an approaching
locomotive for a hotel, they drove furiously into
it in search of refreshment, and reduced their
horse and vehicle to a mass of ruin. The papers
call this a “curious accident,” and say it is “quite
unaccountable.” As if anything that could
happen to a party of Druids coming home from a
lodge is unaccountable ! The Bulletin doesn’t
know much about Druids, but it once attended a
lodge of Free Masons or Enslaved Bricklayers, or
something of the sort, and after it had prevented
three of them harnessing a cow to their buggy by
mistake for a horse, it met one brother on the way
home fighting six rounds with a telegraph-post,
and another standing undressed in the middle of
the road and polishing his boots with a lump of
grass. Still another brother was missing for two
days afterwards, and then he was found sitting on
the steps of the Gr.P.O., covered with soot and
eating a banana,.
The Whale-Cure for Rheumatism*
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WAS helpless with rheumatism, and had tried
every cure unavailingly. Some time ago a whale
was caught near Bega and I was advised to try
the whale-cure for rheumatism—take a bath in the
whale ! Of course Johnson and I—Johnson ached
more than I did —laughed at the idea ! Another
day another whale was killed, and I was worse.
Again the whale-cure was suggested; this time
I began to think, but didn’t face it. A week
after the third whale came in, and I was getting
worse still; so we decided to go over next morn-
ing—and get in. , . „
The morning came; Captain Young was
there in charge of the steam-whaler Jenny
Lind, and kindly consented to run us across
the bay, about four miles, to the trymg-out
works at Kiah. I was lifted into the boat,
for I could hardly move. Johnson had gone
over earlier. We got over safely, crossed the bar,
rounded a point to the left, and there lay two
great whales stripped of the blubber and awaiting
the rising of the tide to be towed away. But,
great Caesar, the smell!
We got ashore, and I was carried to a hut near
the trying-down works. There, on the top of the
biggest whale, trying to cut a rib out, was my
fellow-sufferer, Johnson; and to make the awful
smell less horrible (as if that was possible) he was
singing at the top of his voice. When the rib
was removed, after being divested of all clothes
but a singlet and a borrowed pair of trousers, I
was carried up and placed in the hole cut in the
flesh. My instructions were to work myself down
into the flesh as far as I could, and there stand
until I felt too weak to put up with any more
pressure. Then I was to be dragged out and
dressed warmly and sent home.
Well, I did work down until I imagined every
moment I was going right under. You see, there
was room for two more men to stand beneath me,
the whale being about 17 or 18ft. deep; but the
pressure held me, and when I got down to my
arm-pits I held on to the next-door rib and thought
of the smell. I stood there for an hour and 20
minutes, and just near me was my friend Johnson,
who really seemed to enjoy the situation and kept
shouting smart remarks across the rib that
separated us. But for his company, I could not
have stood it ten minutes.
The smell and heat were hardly bearable. The
whale had been dead about forty hours, and had
started to decompose, and the whole time we were
sitting and standing there great blasts of gas and
horrible bubbles would gush out around us and
make our hair stand on end. The heat, as near as
I could guess, was about llOdeg. ; the smell aver-
aged between a million and a-half and two million
degrees. They say that the older a whale is the
more he smells, and the longer he is dead the
worse he smells. Apparently this whale dated
back some 500 years 8.C., and died in its infancy.
But afterwards ! They dragged me out of the
whale’s side, and I ran down his tail on to the
the shore and up to where my clothes were ! The
effect was wonderful. They rubbed me down,
dressed me and put several coats around me, and
put me in the boat; then we returned to Eden.
That evening I found where the pain had been
worst in my right side a patch had turned quite
black, and the nails on my right hand and foot
were as black as ink, but the rheumatism was all
gone—not a twinge ! They got me a glass of rum
to get a good perspiration up, but the rum refused
to go below my head; the smell was too strong
for it. . i
After four days I walked up town, and everyone
I met shied at me—a leper copld not have been
avoided more'discreetly. Girls that I knew cut
me dead ; men whom I considered true brothers
held their notes and bolted; sometimes* a man
would gallop past, and, if on a fast horse, would say
“Good-day!” and vanish. Of course, being a
country fellow, and sensitive, I felt this—never
dreaming the true cause. At last I met Johnson
and thcii it began tO ; daWn On me. Did I smell
like he did? Then I caught his eye, and, sure
enough, there was the same question lurking there.
Then I knew. .
For exactly twelve months the rheumatism left
me ; then it came back again as bad as ever. The
smell has never left me : that dead whale, haunts
me still.
TRAVELLER.
Prof. Vincent, of the Royal Geographical
Society, has been investigating the mosquito
question. To the Gulf of Mexico and Greenland
the professor awards the palm for producing the
most ferocious of mosquitoes. Has he sampled
the grey-backs that haunt the mangrove swamps
at the mouths of Queensland riVers ?
Joseph Chamberlain and Miss Helen
Gould are the two leading orchid fanciers and pur-
chasers in Europe. South America is the great
field for orchids, but there’s many an orchid-
hunter who would make a handsome thing by
turning his attention to the scrubs of North
Queensland, where gorgeous specimens are found
in abundance.
Gov. M‘Gregor remarks that he found the
women of Western New Guinea remarkably de-
void of personal attractions—man being un-
doubtedly the superior animal in that locality.
The only personal adornment permitted the
females consists of four cicatrical marks extending
from breast to breast. The principal chief, clad
in blue trousers and white shirt, paid a visit to
the Governor. The next visitor was similarly
arrayed, and it was finally discovered that , the
one shirt did duty for the whole band of callers
in succession being transferred from one to
the other as the dusky visitants went and came.
Gov. M‘Gregor notices with disapprobation the
disposition on the part of New Guinea females to
change the simple native petticoat for calico, and
is of opinion that the native garment is much
cleaner and more graceful. He notices also that
native houses become worse built as civilisation
advances. ... Native teacher at Turituri wanted
the children to come to school dressed in European
clothes. The parents were quite willing if he
would only provide the' clothes. To this the
teacher demurred, wherefore a deadlock en-
sued and the young Papuans continued to
roam about naked, ignorant, healthy, and happy.
The life of a native teacher in New Guinea is by
no means devoid of interest. The other day a
native teacher (minus pupils) turned his attention
to pig-shooting. Invading the premises of his
next-door neighbor, he slaughtered porkers twain ;
three more fell victims to his fury out in the road,
and a sixth he slaughtered inside his own fence.
His neighbors assembled with the laudable intent
of treating the Man of God as he had treated the
pigs. The arrival of the Governor’s launch inter-
rupted the circus, and the teacher was condemned
to pay the costs of his pork-hunting. But, then,
what could he do (pleaded the defendant), the
people would not come to school.”


The will of Lady Burton, widow of the
explorer, devotes adequate funds for 3000 masses
to be said for her soul by a French provincial
priest. She also capitalises enough for a daily
mass in a Paris church for all time! Further,
the Bishop of Southwark receives enough t 0
ensure five anniversary masses on the days
respectively of her birth, marriage and death, and
Gapt. Burton’s birth and death. All this makes
a considerable hole in the <£12,000 she leaves.
Also, she provides that, after death, she is to be
pierced through the heart with a needle. Her
body is to be embalmed, and is to be laid beside
Burton’s, in the tomb above ground, but “in case
of a revolution in England, which may lead to
desecration of the cemeteries,” the bodies are to be
removed to a vault underground.
Dear Bulletin, —During the Public Ser-
vice Board discussion in N.S.W. Parlt., it was
said that teachers should “get more pay than
laborer-s. ” Why? It is about time this comparison
was jumped on. If a teacher saw navvies on rail-
way works slinging muck into waggons, for four
hours at a stretch, he would probably be content.
The writer remembers one navvy, a bit out of
fettle (he had been a month on the road), going
into a cutting with a seasoned gang. He got
through that day all right; the next three he spent
on his back, and he was a six-footer, too. The
clerical man has no night-shifts, with poor ventila-
lation, or tent-living on bad water, and gets as
much as the other with these thrown in. How
long does it take the sun and wet and foul air to
break up the ordinary laborer ? —Muscle.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Remember, man, for every sheep miss-
ing at muster, a lash ! There are no dogs about
here save your own, and nothing but neglect can
occasion loss. So look out, my man.” And rosy-
cheeked, bullet-headed Captain Scone rode away,
leaving David Fletcher, 39-176 per ship Hercules,
his newly-assigned shepherd, in charge of 1600
wethers in the range country of his estate of Avon
Dale.
A weakling of the weaklings was Fletcher:
emotional, impulsive, irrational; meaning well
ever, and ever acting ill. He meant to do his duty
in this new sphere of life to which Providence—so
he termed the laws of his own ill-deeds—had
called him. And so, after the manner of his
kind, he didn’t do it —he only dreamed of doing
it, and frittered away in reverie the energy and
time which would have won him his master’s ap-
proval, and it happened that three months later he
was short a hundred and forty sheep.
One hundred and forty lashes ! Fourteen
tallies of ten each ! For Captain Scone, not un-
kind, was just no less to himself than others.
Justice would assuredly demand,' then, the pay-
mentgfer his loss. And, under the circumstances,
therecwas but one method of payment. Lacking
penc ■, there was but Fletcher’s carcase.
Suffering already in anticipation the pains of a
thousand lashes, Fletcher sped from his hut across
the valley to his one neighbor—another of Scone’s
shepherds. Canton was, however, more experi-
enced in many ways. He was a transport of ten
years’ standing, he had felt the curl and swirl of
the lash on two different days, and he was indif-
ferent as to what happened for good or evil.
“ What shall I do ! ” moaned Fletcher, thus
expressing his pain, but scarce expecting an
answer.
Canton replied. “Do ? Take your flog-gin’, o’
course.”
“ But ’twill kill me—kill me ! One-forty—one-
forty ! ”
“Which—body or soul?” derisively questioned
the other. Then he answered himself : “Fellows
like you have no soul. O’ course ’tis your body—
your poor skin as you’re afraid of. Now, look
here ! If you like you can take one-forty of my
sheep and I’ll be short that number and take the
floggin’.”
The craven Fletcher eagerly accepted the offer :
“Oh, will you? How good! And when can I
drive your sheep over?”
‘ ‘ Now ! ” There was a measureless contempt in
the monosyllable.
* * * «
A week later the flocks were mustered, and
Canton’s was short by seven-score.
To the nearest township which boasted of a
triangles, and where the bench could be depended
upon to ratify such an arrangement between
master and man as appraised a sheep at a lash,
went, in due course, Canton. In due course he
pleaded guilty ; in due course he was flogged.
Later, he encountered the fellow for whom he
had suffered. Fletcher, aglow with what he
thought gratitude, but which was nothing save
pleasure at the wholeness of his own skin, thanked
him, and then timorously asked him a question.
“ What did I do it for ? God knows ! I don’t!”
PRICE WARONG.
A Rope’s End.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SOON after the finding of gold in New Guinea by
Andrew Goldie’s party first drew attention to that
mysterious island, the untamed insular Myall, as
free from the blighting influence of our civilisa-
tion as when his progenitor first sighted the
Endeavor’s topsails, peering down from his rugged
granite-buttressed heights saw the steam-lighter
Youra lying snugly moored at the head of the
narrow cliff-girt inlet deeply indenting the northern
shore of lonely Lizard Island.
Bound for the new “ El-Dorado ” on a roving
commission (destined to terminate in the murder
of all hands save the narrator by the cannibals of
Utean), we had sailed from Cairns, some fortnight
previously, in so unseaworthy a condition that we
had to call in at Cooktown to refit. While there
our only deck-hand had deserted, and as the over-
laden and leaky scow was little calculated to in-
spire Jack’s confidence, we were unable to induce
any white seamen to sign articles, the only crew
obtainable being a couple of new-chum Chinese
whose nautical knowledge was strictly limited to
their experiences on the passage from the Flowery
Land.
At this time we were only five hands, all told ;
the balance of the ship’s company consisting of
I , skipper and owner, a young ex-naval middy,
recklessly courageous, but necessarily a poor and
inexperienced seaman ; and A , who acted as
engineer—a thorough “ shell-back ” from scalp to
toe-nails, who confessed to every marine employ-
ment short of piracy, but whose technical attain-
ments barely qualified him to boil a billy. And
then there was the writer, who occupied a position
too anomalous for special designation.
We had touched at this out-of-the-way island (a
few years later to acquire painful notoriety as the
opening scene of the tragedy in which the heroic
Mrs. Watson played such a pitiable part) in order
to cut firewood to eke out our scanty supply of
coals, and, on coming to anchor, the skipper had
landed in our only boat, a fine, new four-oared
“ whaler,” which, being too long to take aboard,
we had in tow.
Landing on the pretty little beach, at the head
of the sheltered cove, I- had left the China-
men to fill the breakers at a spring and cut the
stunted mangrove, the only wood favorable, and
with characteristic rashness had set out alone to
explore the island, hoping, as he said, to fall in
with some of the natives and perhaps induce one
or two of the young “ bucks ” to come with us and
recruit our unique crew.

Later in the afternoon, while finishing in the
deckhouse-cabin a watercolor sketch of rugged
scenery, I was startled by a shout from A—-,
busy forward patching the forestaysail, who called
my attention to the fact that the “Chows” had not
made fast the boat. It had floated off the beach
by the rising tide, and was drifting rapidly past us,
impelled by the fresh southerly breeze.
Knowing that my companion, whose pluck was
beyond question, could not swim a stroke, I had
no alternative but to take to the water in pursuit
without more delay than was necessary to detach
my revolver-pouch from my belt. Fortunately I
was barefooted and, of course, lightly clad.
Always a fair long-distance swimmer, the task
did not look difficult, and I had little doubt of
speedily overhauling the derelict if unmolested by
sharks. Although, however, it had certainly not
got a start of more than 100 yards when I plunged
oYer the low sid o of the vessel, the empty boat
drifting broadside-on offered so much surface to
the wind and had such a slight hold of the water
that it slipped over the toppling wavelets at a rate
that compelled me to swim my fastest in order to
make any material gain.
Certainly at first the gap was rapidly reduced,
the fear of sharks being quite as powerful an in-
centive to “put it all on” as the most alluring
trophy. But the strain was too severe to last, and
I soon found it necessary to husband my failing
strength by easing up, and frequent changes of
stroke and position.
Still about a third of the distance that had
separated me from the object of my pursuit re-
mained unbridged, when I found that the little
harbor was left behind and that every stroke
carried me further from terra firma. I also per-
ceived to my dismay that in the open water, less
sheltered by the land, the speed of the boat’s
drift had so increased that only by exerting myself
in such a manner as threatened speedy exhaustion
could I gain an inch upon the boat. In fact
I was not very sure that I could gain at all. I re-
solved to give up the pursuit while there was yet
time to return, so, turning in despair, I struck out
for the nearest rocky headland.
The sea was now running, however, with a nasty
curl, which while swimming with it I had not
much noticed, and this made progress so uncertain
and distressing that in time the conviction was
forced upon me that my only chance after all was
to reach the boat, now much further to seaward
than when I had first started.
* * * *
Unspeakably depressed, I again turned my back
upon the land with but faint hopes of success,
True it was some relief to again swim with the
run of the sea, but I was already much spent; it
seemed only a question of time when I should
experience those delicious sensations of drowning
so often recounted by resuscitated persons, but
which, it is to be confessed, I recalled with doubt
and certainly without desire. Still I managed to
struggle on, the sensation of fatigue rather wear-
ing away than otherwise, and the motions of my
limbs becoming more mechanical, while an almost
pleasing lassitude crept over me.
In certain phases of danger and nervous
excitement the minutes seem ages; in others,
when physical exhaustion numbs the senses,
the reverse is rather the case. The range
of a swimmer’s vision is but limited, yet every
now and again as I rose on a wave-crest I caught
sight of the drifting boat still about the same dis-
tance ahead; the only other incident in the
struggle being the occasional visit of a booby,
which seemed to regard me with a fearless
curiosity as it skimmed in its wheeling flight close
to my upturned face.
M hether I should ever have succeeded in gain-
ing the boat is more than doubtful had not the
monsoon, as usual, begun to decline with the
setting sun, now little above the distant coast-line,
Noticing this, with renewed hope I pulled myself
together for a final effort, and soon saw with satis-
faction that I was steadily gaining ; but, with the
strengthening hope of safety, the fear of sharks,
which during the latter part of my long swim had
hardly seemed to trouble me, so increased as almost
to paralyse my heart: for the last few yards I
struggled along in a state of indescribable trepida-
tion, which culminated m an agony of horror as,
just on getting within arm’s-length of safety, I
felt something rough glide along my right leg.
With a supreme effort, which must otherwise have
been my last, I frantically clutched the gunwale,
heeling the empty boat nearly to the water’s edge;
how I managed to get in I know not, unless fear
lent me the requisite strength.
* * * *
’ When I recovered consciousness I found myself
lymg on the bottom boards of the whaler, where
I must have lain prostrated with fatigue and
fright for some considerable time, the sun being
now set and the island fading away far to the
southward. In those days, however, I was young
and hardy, and the nature of my occupations had
so indurated nerve and sinew that I soon pulled
myself together and set to work to get sail on the
boat.
There was still a nice little air, quite enough for
a boat in such light trim. She was a smart, well-
rigged little craft and weatherly ; so by the time,
night had fallen we were footing it merrily tc
windward. Steering by the “ Cross,” in about an
hour’s time I picked up the Voura’s mast-head
light which A had thoughtfully lit as a beacon,
and sometime before midnight succeeded in gain-
ing the anchorage without further mishap.
Truth compels me to state that the ferocious
shark whose maw I had so narrowly escaped,
turned out to be merely the trailing painter
of. the boat, which had grazed my shin in swim-
ming over it.
