Russian Literature
The biographical sketch, by Eugenii
Soloviev, of Dostoievsky (Allen and Unwin,
per Dymock’s Library), enables us to under-
stand something of this genius, who ended
in 1881 a most unhappy life. Dostoievsky
had to write the majority of his novels
against time, for he was always plunged to
the ears in debt. Hence liis work shows no
mark of either sustained effort or careful
finish. His.work is “jumbled together in a
hurried, breathless sequence which testifies
at once to strain, to crises in the non-con-
tinuity of the creative faculty, to the light-
ning-like character of his genius, and to the
all-pervading weariness with which he was
consumed.” It was impossible for him to
save money. He used to bind himself to do
certain work, and once in the hands of the
publishing firms he spent nearly all the rest
of his life struggling to wrest himself free.
Compelled to look on life as a task, a duty, a
struggle, he rigorously excludes from his
novels enchanting' descriptions qf Nature,
enthralling love scenes,' bewitching women,
and kisses. And he was a psychopath—
during childhood he suffered from hallucina-
tions, and, later, from epilepsy, also display-
ing manifest symptoms of hysteria and the
obsession of distrust.
His father sent this unbalanced youth to
the School of Engineering in Petrograd,
which he left to enter the public service. But
the monotony of his life led him to leave the
service. The MS, of his first novel, Poor Folk,
was brought to the notice of a great critic,
who was so excited over his discovery that
he sat up till 4 a.m. to finish the story, and
then straightway set forth to find the author
and wake him with his congratulations.
Dostoievsky was then only 20 years of age.
In one bound he had reached the highest
pinnacle of literary fame. Was it any
wonder that the youth’s conceit became colos-
sal? He plunged feverishly into work, and
just as feverishly into debt. The Twins, his
next story, was a failure; and The Landlady
was characterised as mere hysterical rub-
bish. Luckily—for literature —he was sen-
tenced as a revolutionary to four years’
penal servitude in the prison of Omsk in
Siberia. The probability is that Dostoievsky
was merely a doctrinaire revolutionary.
In Siberia he conceived the remarkable
Letters from a Dead House. “Dostoievsky’s
term of penal servitude did to a certain
extent benefit him. Up to the time of his
arrest his mental attitude was in every
respect deplorable, and likely to end in suicide.
,If Date had not stepped in... .perhaps he
would have done away with himself ; per-
haps, through conviction or despair, he would
hiive developed into a revolutionary; per-
haps time would have helped him to acquire
self-control. Each conjecture is at least
possible.... We may suppose that, in
general, his prison experiences exercised
upon him a ‘toning-down’ effect.... Thus,
while his temperament and his views re-
mained the same, the sort of timidity or awe
of life which, had, from the first, been a part
of his character now bulked larger, and came
into greater prominence, and ousted his quon-
dam bursts of initiative and self-wi11....
Dostoievsky had no choice but to put up
with his loneliness (loneliness of intellect,
in that community of peasant and degraded
minds), and to concentrate his whole exist-
ence upon his infier life, upon the life of his
emotions.... ‘lndeed,’ he says, ‘I came even
to bleSs Fate for having sent me this loneli-
ness, in that, without it, I could never have
arraigned myself, nor have made of my past
career so stern a revision.’.. . .From that
time forth Dostoievsky began both to preach
and to practise humility and- the denial of
every imperious, persistent aspiration in
life.” But the Letters from a Dead House
were not written until ten years afterwards.
After his release from prison he had to
become a private in a Siberian corps, but
was soon afterwards permitted to retire. It
was during this period that he fell in love
and married. A brief, unhappy married life
was ended by his wife’s death. After his
return from Siberia, for the means for which
he had to borrow large sums, Dostoievsky,
says his biographer, “remained as impatient,
as rancorous, as hysterical, as self-diffident
a mortal as before his exile.” He became
the editor and principal contributor of a
Russian journal, for which he wrote both
The Despised and Rejected and Letters from
a Dead House. Then the censor suppressed
the journal. Dostoievsky got more and
more deeply into debt, having to take over
the indebtedness of the widow of his brother,
since the widow and family were themselves
utterly destitute. Ultimately Dostoievsky
had to declare himself bankrupt. “I am
writing another novel, and writing it under
the lash, and of necessity, and against time,”
he writes; characteristically adding: “True,
it will create a sensation when completed;
but what good will that do me? Forced
work, work done only to earn money, stifles
and corrodes the faculties.”
“Thenceforth there began a great period—
a period of great novels, a period of grim,
spasmodic activity, a period of the produc-
tion of a mass of ill-considered, hastily-
written stuff over which the writer’s un-
equalled genius casts fitful, lightning-like
gleams.” His great novel, Crime and Pun-
ishment, met with a marvellous success; but
in spite of the generous fees that he received
he remained in a state of chronic impecuni-
osity. Thousands and thousands of roubles
had*to go toward the discharge of his debts:
and no sooner had he completed one novel
than he had to start on another. In order
to complete his contracts for work he
engaged a stenographer, and a few months
later he married her. The next four years
he spent abroad, in Germany and Switzer-
land, turning out one huge volume every
year, and, as ever, hard up. He and his
wife could not return to Russia because he
would have t© face his creditors. But at
last lie was able to return to Petrograd; and
the rest of his story is that of a mature and
ever-growing renown, with some relief from
money worries. To this period belongs his
finest work, The Brothers Karamazov —upon
which Dostoievsky worked for ten years.
“My name alone is worth a million roubles,”
he said. There was vanity in that remark,
but also truth. At his funeral there was a
universal outburst of veneration for his
genius. .
The latest volume of Dostoievsky’s novels
to be translated is A Raw Youth (Ileine-
mann, per Dymock’s Library). This is the
autobiography of a youth, the illegitimate
son of a Russian landowner and a peasant
girl, who is thrown into the most marvellous
adventures in a society of the most diverse
and extraordinary types. There are the in-
terminable discussions, the strange psychologi-
cal discoveries, the acute self-analysis of the
narrator’s youthful and inchoate mind, and
the many excitements and astounding cli-
maxes that Dostoievsky gives to his readers
with the wasteful prodigality of his feverish
genius. But the book of 560 closely-printed
pages must rank as one of Dostoievsky’s
lesser works. It is certainly not the novel
that a student of this great Russian should
begin on.
The River of Life, and other stories, by
Alexander Kuprin (Maunsel, per Dymock’s
Library), contains two remarkable stories —
the rest is merely popular pabulum. Pro-
bably there is a large public in Russia that
prefers the romantic story, of the style fea-
tured in English and U.S. magazines, to
Dostoievsky. We are apt to forget that the
Russian, besides being a saint, as Stephen
Graham suggests, or an ignorant peasant, or
an intellectual, or a revolutionary,or a
bureaucrat, is also an average human being.
“Captain Ribnikov,” however, is different.
This is the story of a Japanese spv in Petro-
grad, during the Russo-Jap strafeing match,
who pretends to be a Russian captain, dis-
charged owing to his wounds at the Front.
Despite the extreme cleverness of his dis-
guise, which depends less upon his appear-
ance than upon his simulation of Russian
mental characteristics, he is suspected by a
Russian author. “By business and disposi-
tion Schavinsky was a collector of human
documents. Often for weeks, sometimes for
months together, he watched an interesting
type, tracking him down with the persistence
of a passionate sportsman or an eager detec-
tive.... In justification of this precarious
sport he could say that the inner psychologi-
cal interest for him considerably surpassed
the benefits he subsequently acquired as a
realistic writer.” So, when his suspicions
are aroused by the extreme Russianism of
this familiar type of Russian, and he scents
dissimulation, he forces his friendship upon
the captain and never allows him out of his
sight. And when he gets his victim alone he
urges the captain to confess, telling him that
he is quite safe. . “I shan’t do you any harm,
if it’s only because I’m full of admiration
for vour amazing courage... .The one thing
I don’t understand is the incessant strain on
the ■ mind and will, the diabolical waste of
spiritual strength. To forget to think" in
Japanese, to forget your name utterly, to.
identify yourself completely with another’s
personality.... !” And though the Russian
subjects his victim to a thousand cunning-
tests, he, though suspicious, can never be
quite sure that Ribnikov is a spy.
But where the clever Russian failed a
common Russian prostitute succeeded. The
spy, whose arduous profession had compelled
him to live an austere, ascetic life, is taken
to a place where Russian Flosskies congre-
gate, and there is tempted and falls. In his
sleep he utters the word “Banzai!” —the only
Japanese word that this Flosski knew. He
jumps from the room, but the girl impedes
him, and he falls on the pavement below
with a broken leg.
The difference between a European author
and an English or Australian one is that the
former can take every aspect of life and
make it a subject for his literary art. And,
given that license, the Russian author is not
tempted to abuse it. Where the English
author touches upon these forbidden subjects
he is often led toward salacity by the restric-
tions placed upon him by Mrs. Wowser, n6e
Grundy. He dare not call a spade a spade:
all he can do is to hint that a spade is some-
thing much more exciting and seductive than
the article usually used to shovel muck. So
here, and in The Flight from the Gross, the
authors depict intimate scenes in the abodes
of Flosski with the matter-of-fact realism
that by telling everything dispels the sugges-
tion that there is anything more. There is
no attempt on the part of either author to
emphasise the sexual suggestions of such
scenes: these incidents are merely subord-
inate in the big scheme of life. So
Dostoievsky utilises his passionate episodes:
he does not emphasise them. They fall natur-
ally into their necessary places in his grave
and comprehensive art. The English
authoress who specialises in discreet naughti-
ness is really helped rather than hindered by
the conventions of Mrs. Wowser, nee Grundy.
Her climax is merely a row of intentionally-
tantalising dots; and no author who gives
all the facts in their due relation to each
other can hint half as much as can be
expressed by
.. t
The other delightful story in The River of
Life is “The Outrage,” in which, in a highly-
humorous scene, the delegates of an Associa-
tion of Thieves plead their deserving cause
before a barristers’ committee who were in-
vestigating the cases of those who had suf-
fered in the last pogram against the Jews.
The Thieves’ Association had been slandered
by the printed imputation that they were
among the instigators of the pogram paid
and organised by the police. Their argu-
ments and practical demonstrations of their
methods of work are so convincing that the
barristers are assured of their innocence, and
the chairman shakes the hand" of the leader
of the deputation. The scene is conceived in
a spirit of true comedy. The author adds the
astonishing statement that the story is true.
J*
Kuprin’s knowledge of the army has been
gained by seven years’ service. When, after
his resignation, in order to devote himself to
literature, he published The Duel, an impar-
tial study of military life, to his great sur-
prise the public accepted the .book as a new
indictment of the army. Kuprin denied this
unexpected judgment, but, in the end, had to
accept the fame that it brought him. But,
except aS a story-teller, he has had little in-
fluence upon his readers. Unlike the usual
Russian author, he is quite objective in his
attitude to life. He never obtrudes or ex-
ploits his personality.
&
Osip Duimov’s best story is. Vlass, a cap-
tivating autobiography of a child. His play,
Niyiii has had a very great. success. The
Flight from the Cross (Laurie) predisposes
the Australian reader in his favor. Though
the theme is typically Russian, and therefore
typically un-Australian—thfe aim of all the
characters in this interesting novel is to
“seek their Cross” of suffering—the charac-
ters are brilliantly drawn, and these persons
are Russians, but also human beings, whose
motives are convincing and real.
One difficulty that awaits the reader of
Russian novels is obviated by the list of prin-
cipal characters printed at the beginning.
When characters have names like Shtche-
tinine and Semiryechenski, and these two
are in love with each other, the Australian’s
confusion of identity during a dialogue is not
to be wondered at, since that difficulty was
not anticipated by the author. And —a fur-
ther concession to the English reader, the
official Russian mode of address is not per-
sisted in; each character boars one name
throughout.
All the characters, from “the Master”
down to a prostitute, are impelled to take up
their Cross of suffering, but all run away
from it. The Master is a noble .philosopher
who gives utterance to most brilliant aphor-
isms, but he learns at last how despicable
he is in character. The novel opens with this
remark: “The evening had been a great
success. The Master was in good form, and
before midnight had delivered himself of three
brilliant aphorisms, one on the temperature
and two on militarism.” But though Duimov
might have made of this poseur a scathing
caricature, he reveals him, with a genial
tolerance, as a mere unfortunate human
being. The author has the same gentle under-
standing of characters like the mean and
stupid sub-professor, Slyazkih, the wanton
actress Nadeja, the prostitute Jenia and the
remarkable girl student Elena, who refuses
the love of at least two good men merely
from a love of renunciation, and who is so
determined to die young that she does. In
fact, this orgy of renunciation results in the
suicide of quite a number of the characters.
Only Neil, who when refused by Elena, took
up with a prostitute, survives, apparently to
become famous and happy. In this remark-
able gallery of portraits the character of
the military officer is the most eerie study in
psychology. This is how he explains his
love to the actress: —■
“You are very like the Baroness L.,
although both her eyes and her face were
different. But you are of the same type. I
met the baroness at a ball —she reminded me
of a girl I knew once —Zina Boltov, her name
was- —who died. For some months I could
not get used to the fact that she was some-
one else, and not Zina. It is a very curious
thing—you are like the baroness, and the
baroness was like Zina —and Zina reminded
me of a woman I had seen somewhere, but I
have forgotten where. It all seems so
muddled. It is very strange that I can never
remember who it was that Zina was like!
It is obvious that there must have been a
beginning—a starting-point.” His perplex-
ity is resolved only when he becomes insane;
but the amazing "discovery of the origin of
his love, together with the curious theory of
love that he built upon that discovery, may
well be left for the individual reader. An-
other of his theories is almost as interest-
ing. “Suddenly Shtchetinine imderstood
that....the confused joy aroused by the
contemplation of a landscape is joy caused
by the expectation of meeting the Woman
there; that the sorrow which fills the heart
at the sight of forests, fields and sunsets is
the sorrow born of the meeting with her;
that the scenes, the grass, the rustling of the
trees in one’s native place are sweet and
dear to us above all, because it is here,
amongst his own people, that a man expects
to meet the Woman.”
But perhaps one should not take too seri-
ously his further discoveries about Woman,
since they are uttered in the early stages of
his madness. “I will tell you something else
which is not generally known—women do
not really exist. So long as a man looks at
them, they are—he turns away—they are
not! Also, they do not feel pain ; or, .at
least, they feel it very slightly, like
beetles. ...”
The Flight from the Cross is a profound
and arresting analysis of many of, the re-
markable aspects of the Russian soul. And
what the civilisation of the future is to be
will largely depend upon the Russian soul.
The Little Demon, by Feodor Sologub
(Seeker, per Dymock’s Library) is no doubt
necessary for our comprehension of. modern
Russian literature, but it is horribly un-
pleasant. This is the story of an unneces-
sary man who goes mad. His feelings and
thoughts are analysed with a diabolical
cleverness; and the life in a small Russian
town is depicted with a terrible realism.
“After supper they all got drunk, even the
women. Volodin proposed that they should
dirty the walls some more. (This was the
tenants' way of getting even with a hated
landlady.) They were delighted; almost
before they had finished supper they acted
on this suggestion and amused themselves
prodigiously. They spat on the wallpaper,
poured beer on it, and they threw at the
walls and ceiling paper arrows whose ends
were smeared with butter, and they flipped
pieces of moist bread at the ceiling. After-
wards they invented a new game, which
they played for money; they tbre strips of
the wallpaper to see who could get the larg-
est.” The madness of the sorry hero is
symbolised by the “nedotikomka,” which
accompanies the hero through all the stages
of his progress to the mad-house. This is a
symbol of the evil of the world. “One
strange circumstance puzzled him. There
came running from somewhere a strange,
indescribable creature —a small, grey and
nimble nedotikomka. It nodded, and it
trembled, and circled round Peredonov.
When he stretched out his hand to catch it,
it glided swiftly out of sight, hid itself
behind the door or the sideboard, but re-
appeared a moment later, and trembled and
mocked again—the grey, featureless, nimble
creature.” Evidently a Russian fantod. *
Apparently with the idea cf orightening
lip this sordid record, the author has intro-
duced an erotic episode, which is still
unpleasant, since it deals with what might
fairly be termed an example, innocent
enough, of sex-perversion. The author’s
delight in this episode is somewhat sicken-
ing. The Little Demon is certainly a work
of art; Sologub has an uncanny power of
depicting the strata of Russian life that he
has chosen. The Australian point of view
questions the need for the exercise of Solo-
gub’s talents upon such a medium. At
least, the Australian pmjam has its occa-
sional moments of gaiety. ■ '
:—«— -A
“H.W.S.”: Re the Red Page’s answer to
“Don Emma” (B. 8/6/TG) and the deficiency
of riming words in the English language.
All Bulletin poets must at some time or
another have been stuck for a suitable rhyme.
Imagine “Bellerive,” for instance, with only
revenge to rime with avenge; only carve (O
irony!) to'rime with starve; no rime at all
for scarf, faults, silver, gulph, month or
oblige; imagine The BullMCN’s * cow: poets
with only bilk and silk to rime with
milkj the amatory poets with only
four very hackneyed for love,
and' then having to fall back on
prove, etc.; only two rimes for lisp; then
the Egyptian poets, having to make the
Sphinx play high jinks with a minx, in want
of suitable ones. Now for a remedy: several
“Abo.-liars” have lately been complaining
about the unsuitable names Australian flora
is burdened with. It would certainly do with
re-naming; what names there are which are
not imported (like wild pansy, blue bell,
violet, fuchsia, etc., tacked to flowers which
are not violets, pansies, etc., at all) are
mostly ugly and unsuitable, spider orchids,
pig, cat head, rat’s tail, parsley ferns. Now
how about earning the gratitude of Austra-
lia’s poets by providing’ us with some more
suitable riming words? .
[But for scarf there Sre “tarf - and “not ’arj”; for
faults, assaults, va/ults, malts; for month, the
twenty-oneth; and in the other instances, such as
milk and jinks, there are other rimes.]
International Gartoons of the War
(Cliatto and Windus) is an excellent bob’s
worth. 11. Pearl Adam, in his readable
introduction, wisely stresses the value of
the contemporary cartoon; for it deals
almost entirely with what people are feel-
ing, in contrast to what they are doing.
It shows with unfailing accuracy the trend
of public feeling. One curious result of the
war has been the enormous boom in war-
cartoons which has characterised Paris. One
of Veber’s famous cartoons, published at
five francs, was within a few months unob-
tainable under 500. Collectors took the
bint, and the drawings of artists like
Forain, Steilen, etc., soon rose to very high
premiums. Now ambitious works are pub-
lished at 100 francs, and have crowded out
the smaller artist, the. smaller print-seller
and the smaller collector. The grim note of
the French cartoonist is wholly lacking in
the English. English cartoonists are too
good-humored. “Will Dyson, the young-
artist of whom Australia has such reason
to be proud, is our grimmest product, and
even he lets the’ Prussian off more easily
than do the French artists.” , (To Aus-
tralians many of the English cartoons seem
utterly childish.) The only fault this page
can find in this fine collection is that it is
quite unrepresentative,

IMPORTANT.—LOOK TO TOUR TEETH.
There are no teeth like those furnished by Nature. For service, comfort and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be compared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to preserve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap and water are useful, but somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttlefish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enanfel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifically prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

NERVES
And How to Keep
them sound. & £?
NERVES are the source of continuous worry to-day to some
people holding Civil, Military, Social or Commercial posi-
tions. When leaders of society, commerce, war, politics, or
other professionals, feel the strain almost to breaking point, the
nerves are found to be the weak spot in the chain of healthy life.
The ability and fitness to do things depend upon real good sound
nerves.
p * * #
In volcanic times like these, when the nerves of the world
are on edge, the nerves of the individual often show their weakness
and give way.
* * * *
This is the time when the real, one great nerve-strengthening
Clements Tonic should be taken and the nerves put right. For
that it does put them right, and quickly and permanently, is
vouched for by such well-known professional persons as Madame
Brola, Miss Agnes Murphy (Madame Melba’s biographer and
secretary to the late Quinlan Opera Company), and others equally
well known in the profession.
ifc * * *
Clements Tonic is a healer of the nerves. It strengthens the
brain that supplies power, and it helps to keep fit those who are fit
and healthy, as well as the one who is ailing and seeking health.
Do not be without this really good medicine. It does general good.
It is the advance agent of healthy life. When you keep it in a sense
you keep yourself insured against ill-health. .

Kidney disease is most certainly on the in-

whether you are suffering from this or not?
Here are some of the symptoms of kidney

in the morning, constipation, cloudy and bad-
colored urine, general feeling of weakness
and irritability, puffiness under the eyes—
these are all symptoms of kidney trouble.
then people who suffer from backache,
rheumatism, gout, sciatica, gravel, stone or

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Flanders—May, 1916.
Low hung above the raw drenched field, the
sky
Drizzles to rain. The new green wheat-
fields lie
Jewelled with drops, and from the white
walled farm
Beneath the poplars glows a window warm.
Below the willows by the reedy stream,
From the lush grasses, see the flickering
gleam
Of pale gold iris; softly over all
Drowned petals of the apple-blossom fall.
Past streaming hedges wan with fire of
spring
Mired to the knees our plodding columns
swing,
And rolling in the ruts the grim guns crawl
With muzzled snouts; far off their brothers
call
Their thunderous paeans. High-flung star-
shells gleam,
The maxims gibber as the great shells
scream,
Gaunt Death stalks out to claim his ghastly
right,
And Day weeps out upon the lap of Night.
Behind the parapet the watchers wait
The coming rush. High o’er the little gate
Before the wayside shrine, a shape of pain,
.the white Christ glistens through the fall-
ing rain.

JACK SOMMERS.
A Parable.
They fished the rivers of the world
With bait and hook of dream;
They saw the sunset’s banners furled
The lights of morn astream;
And ever to the shore they drew
Some wonder of the waters new.
On gleaming scale and flashing fin
The noonday sun looked down.
Oh, joy was theirs from men to win
The fisher’s high renown!
Their patience wore the ages grey;
New visions rose with every day.
And while they whipped the changing stream
With subtle lines of thought,
Th Or brothers, scorning idle dream,
\vith sweat of labor wrought,
Eager within their hands to hold
The treasure of the mountain’s gold.
They rested not by day or night
From that tremendous toil
To grasp as victors in the fight
The world’s rock-guarded spoil;
fior shining metal was the thing
That, won, might make a man a king.
Fishing and mining, all the world
To double purpose runs.
White mists about the stars are curled
I lame banners wrap the suns;
And still the miner scorns the dream
And the long thought-lines whip the stream.
Visions and deeds! The world whirls on
borne far-off goal to win.
Old bands that grasped the gold are gone,
And fish of rainbow fin,
Drawn from the waters of the years,
Have passed with age-old joys and tears.
But in his cave an ancient man,
YY hite-bearded, calm of eye,
Gazing on all since time began
And seeing all things die,
Murmurs of faith and hope that bleed
lill hopeful dream weds faithful deed.

And wreathes the ivory limbs of tranefed

Move as dl m shapes of beauty through a

To fill with kisses.

Where searing pain and bliss is;

But Caution, cool and cunning dame
The thought dismisses.
Ah, Miriam, thou are indeed

I keep thy blooms in store *
Thy touch can all my being melt

WHERE THERESA
If it is not the WILL of the’ Australian
public to carry a burden of debt to pay for
imported tyres amounting to hun-
dreds of thousands of pounds per
annum,
It is the will of the neutral
manufacturer, however, that
we should d& sa.
The WAY to save this burden resting too
heavily on our shoulders is to buy Tyres
and other Rubber Goods made in Our own
country.

PERDRIAU TYRES are manufactured from pure

and the plies will not come apart.
PERDRIAU TYRES offer the
greatest resistance to skidding. The
three heavy broad ribs running fore

Your strongest line of defence against tyre troubles
is to see that your car is shod with PERDRIAUS.

CONFIDENCE AND ITS TRICKS.
The fine spring air, loaded with the news-
boy’s yell of victory, is pleasantly warming
Australia’s heart and filling everybody with
the easy assurance that, though advances
may be slow, the end is sure and that the
period of bitter striving and patient endur-
ance will soon be at an end. Austria
looks like cracking up; Germany appears
inferior at every point to the Allies; and an
English journalist prattles blithely to the
Italians about taking the Kaiser to London
in chains. The general confidence is very
cheering; but, in the light of the fact that
recruiting in Australia isn’t exactly a stam-
pede to the training camp, and in Canada is
as slow as a suburban train, it is well to
take stock of things and see whether the
growing confidence may not be rather a con-
fidence trick playqd by Fate. Even counting
Austria, Turkey and Bulgaria out, the fact
remains that the possibilities pf a nation
hemmed in like Germany on every side by
tremendous armies, and cut off from com-
munication with the outside world by the
steel walls of watchful ships, are not easily
exhausted. That the end is sure may be
taken as an axiom, but the nearness of that
end cannot be predicted with any sort of cer-
tainty. That the Teuton Empire may become
suddenly panic-stricken and throw in the
towel or the Kaiser or whatever else may
be handy in token of defeat, is among the war
chances. So also is a sudden stroke of
strategy which may break up* the enemy s
defence and allow the conquering Allied
armies to pour into the heart of the country
beyond the Rhine. But it is equally possible
that a slow, stubborn despair may unite the
German people in one of those forlorn and
long-continued struggles for existence whose
records make the bloodiest reading in all
history. When a nation has nothing to
hope for it may prefer war at its worst to
any peace it can achieve; and the nation gone
berserk in steadfast rage can pile up
mighty casualty lists before its last shot is
.fired.
* * * *
Take the case of France after the loud ex-
plosion of the first Revolution. All Europe
was against her. Her organisation was of
the poorest. Her armies fought until it
seemed that the nation’s reserves of men
must be exhausted. The new Republic was
surrounded by foes; its cash and credit had
seemingly come to an end. Statesmen
talked of finally crushing the regicides and
bringing the war to a finish in a few months.
And then on the wreck of things arose
Napoleon ! No longer did the war drag on.
It moved, instead, with astonishing speed.
The Allies, now aroused, put out their full
strength and made things bitter; and by
ISOS all French power had been swept from
the sea. Yet it was not until 1812 that the
nation which 14 or 15 years earlier had
been supposed to be crippled to exhaustion
was actually trodden underfoot by the
swarming foe. Even then, after a very short
breathing space, there was enough vitality
left in the Gallic people to make a brave
show during the short and disastrous Water-
loo campaign. Of course, Germans are not
Frenchmen ; and modern German ideals have
none of the appeal to the heart of a strong
man which the principles of the Revolution,
even interpreted in terms of Napoleon, had
for the soldier who fought at Austerlitz. But
allowing for all that, the fact remains that
the isolation of a nation and its peril at the
hands of alien enemies is apt to call forth
resources of self-denial and miracles of
organisation and enthusiasm scarcely pos-
sible to peoples who have not been compelled
to look their complete destruction steadily in
the eyes. The very crimes of the German
nation, which have put it beyond hope of
concluding an honorable peace, may make for
a unity of despair of a nature to lengthen
the war and increase its horrors.
* • * * #
But the successful development of a more
furious and desperate German defence, if it
is foreseen, can be met by a more determined
and thoroughly-organised attack. Much as
the human element still counts in war, it is
overshadowed by the power of the machine ;
and even Germany, with every man gone
berserk and every woman toiling in the
munition factories, could not rise in an hour
or a month to the point of overwhelming the
Allies at vital points. From the very nature
of modern war, the revival of German power
must be slow; and in that lies our great
chance to hurry matters and get in the
knock-out smash. If, however, the Allies
slacken the pressure or fail to keep up a
boundless supply of men and munitions, the
pendulum will swing in the other direction.
The idea that we hold the enemy in the
hollow of our hands must, for this reason, be
put on one side. We are gaining; but we
have not gained so much that it
would be impossible to lose in the
end. And the idea that Australia
has done her fair share must also be pushed
aside as mere trifling with the question.
There is no such thing as doing a fair share
until the goal is reached. Our business is
not to render so many tons of shove to the
Allies’ united push or to take our evenly-
scheduled portion of pain and cost with the
rest of the British countries. Our business
is to smash the Germans. Had we stood out
of the struggle altogether from the first with
a mean notion that it wasn’t our fight and
that it was pleasanter to take no risks, we
might have despised ourselves pretty heartily
by now; but the longer or shorter duration
of the war could have been of little conse-
quence to us. We did not stand aside, how-
ever ; we went in with a cheer and an assur-
ance that the Kaiser was likely to be up
against our last man armed with our last
shilling; and, once,having taken that stand,
it is to our interest —to our every interest —
to hurry the war along at top speed. How
can we do it? That is the one big question
before us. Our recruiting has fallen off
miserably. The voluntary system has gone
shaky at the knees; and still there is no
straight-out pronouncement of what is to be
done. The delay in national organisation
means a. plain slackening in the force of our
blow, and if history teaches us anything at
all it is that we cannot at this stage slacken
our blow without tremendous danger.
THE AUSTRALIAN ELECTOR AS A
PUNTER.
A. COUNTRY where the function of govern-
ment is controlled by a ruling class takes a
bis gamble. Of such countries there are still
some, and there have been many. Up to date
the gamble has always ended in the same
way—in calamity for the people who played
it. True, there have been any number of
instances in which ruling families and classes
have produced men of striking abilities, equal
to the highest duties of statesmanship. But
the system worked with more uncertainty
than a siveep on the Newmarket Handicap,
for in that there must always be a winner,
while in the other there might be all blanks.
In any case there was most deplorable waste
of human material and misuse of men. Gen-
erations were born into positions for which
they were quite unfit, but they filled them, all
the same. Men who should have been poul-
try-farmers became kings; instinctive green-
grocers became statesmen and diplomats;
pedlars by nature became chancellors of
treasuries by accident. The pages of history
are strewn with stories of the calamitous
consequences—and the columns of the news-
papers and Hansard are bulging with evi-
dence that the weary old gamble is still on.
Out of ballot-boxes regiments of individuals
are leaping into places of influence and
power, where their capacity for muddlement
secures unlimited opportunity for asserting
itself. The waste of men is still disastrous,
the misuse of men in the business of govern-
ment a recurring tragedy. Democracy has
not yet mastered the job of getting its man
with any more certainty than did oligarchies
and aristocracies. All it has succeeded in
achieving is a rather quicker method of get-
ting rid of someone when he has been found
out. But even this is a cumbrous, two-
edged process, for it usually results in acquir-
ing a further disaster, or in leaping out of
the frying-pan into the lion’s mouth or some-
where. By accident someone is occasionally
got by ballot who seems to be just the thing
the Democracy requires; then our system of
government at once puts him where he can
do the least possible service. The ballot-box
is the totalisator of political punters.
* * * *
The lives of two men whose names were
before the Australian public the other day,
for quite different reasons, illustrate the
gamble— George Turner and Jack Scad-
dan. The one had died in Victoria; the
other had been snuffed out at a Westralian
by-election. Both of these men had been
summoned by Democracy to direct public
policy and control Administration in their
respective States. Turner was understand-
able. He was not a brilliant genius, but lie
brought to the job in hand some rare quali-
ties of mind and character. He was a ser-
vant of the public in the strictest sense, with
an infinite capacity for taking pains and
with a healthy readiness to call things by
their right names. He weighed facts with
scrupulous care, had little time for the shib-
boleths of party, and clung fast to the quaint
theory that the national interests are of more
importance than politicians’ skins. His ser-
vices to Australia were of great value. But
there is not much room for these plain men
who know their work, and do it without fuss,
even though one of them may be worth a
hundred of the hot-air merchants who yell
themselves into notoriety or elbow themselves
into the limelight. Men like Scaddan are
thrown up in the gamble instead. Here was
a man with every one of the qualities that
unfitted him to be a political servant of the
public, yet by the irony of the system pitch-
forked into the very place where he could
do the public the greatest amount of damage.
Had Scaddan been the product of a scheme
of government based on the privileges of
birth he would have been an awful example
of the madness and dangers of the gamble on
heredity. As a product of the gamble at the
polls, he is no less an awful example of what
may happen. Constitutionally he was merely
a good-natured political profligate, whose
principles had beginning and bnd in the
debauchery of the State. Why should a com-
munity free from the thraldom ,of class
ascendancy and able to choose for itself the
trustees of its credit and the administrative
guardian of its interests select a Scaddan?
What form of madness is at work to make it
do this thing? The truth is of course that it
does not choose —that it merely pitches pieces
of paper into receptacles in the midst of a
violent uproar and a carnival of wire-pulling,
and what happens afterwards is just plain
accident.
To use a man of the Scaddan type as a
political leader or as any sort of instrument
in government is to grossly misuse him and
to give sanction to an indefensible form of
social waste. As a citizen no doubt he is
capable of doing something socially useful.
He ought to do it. To allow men like
Turner to footle away their time attending
to the details of private undertakings is to
misuse them. Their right place in the scheme
of things is where the Scaddans of this life
are playing havoc with the opportunities of
the hour. The men for whom democracies
are looking are in no sense different from
those who have been wanted in theory, at
any rate, under every system of government
the world has known. They are not the dul-
lards and plungers of their generation—the
tricksters and the ignorant and the vain.
They are the men of character, of capacity
and of vision. Of these the supply is every-
where limited. Of the others, the supply is
never-ending. Scaddan is only one of a
crowd. All over the Commonwealth
there are men in places of the highest re-
sponsibility whose occupancy of their posts
is a jest and whose muddling inefficiency is a
by-word. They are there through the people
—and in spite of them. And our present sys-
tem will give us more of them. The case for
the Referendum has no stronger argument
than this —that without it the popular vote
is almost wholly futile. The Referendum is
no gamble. A Parliament and Party Minis-
try is the greatest gamble on earth—-and
Australia regularly plays it up six times
more than any other country in the world,
and gets what it oughtn’t to have exactly six-
times more frequently.
HOLMAN’S CHANCE TO WIN A HALO
BY GIVING MILTON FIVE BOB.
The idea, recently put to Holman, that
the State of N. S. Wales might take on the
job of assisting literature in a systematic
fashion is, of course, not new. The British
Government has been paying literary
pensions for many years; and the Common-
wealth Treasury shells out a few shillings
annually to widows or dependants of writers
who left little but the talexof their misfor-
tunes behind them. Some of this money is
paid in genuine recognition of literary merit;
much of it merely as a compassionate allow-
ance for which somebody’s alleged literary
achievement is made an excuse. All of it
is given in a haphazard fashion and as a
gratuity rather than as payment for service
rendered. In N. S. Wales it is proposed to
take a higher stand and work on a more
definite plan. It is suggested that literary
prizes should be awarded for the best product
of the year—not mere bones thrown to
hungry dogs who have no claim other than
their leanness, but payment by the State
for service actually rendered to the State
and of permanent value. About the amounts
so awarded and the manner in which they
are to be handed out there may be room for
any amount of discussion, but on the general
principle of the thing nobody who has even
the attenuated rudiments of a soul can have
any misgivings. It is merely a return to the
fine Greek method which in the best days of
Athens produced results that lifted the
world on faster and farther than the con-
quests of Alexander and the preaching of
Socrates.
* * * *
The man who devotes himself to creative
writing may do so from vanity, from a
high sense of responsibility to use the best
gift in his outfit, from the joy of the artist
in his work, or from a blending of all three;
but whatever his motive, or the lack of it,
he renders service to his fellows at what
must count as large self-sacrifice in a get-
rich-quickly world. Once in a century a
writer of verse and fiction of the highest
sort may make money almost as readily as
the successful farmer or the person who takes
public contracts; but never in all the years
does one arise who can accumulate wealth
like the draper or wholesale importer of
shoddy. The appreciation of the very best
in literature is seldom widespread enough to
pan out nTuch in cash. The few appreciate
and through successive generations go on
appreciating, and it is to the influence of
those few that the world owes all its uplift.
Milton got fIS for “Paradise Lost.” lie
might hawk his manuscript a long way before
he got as much to-day. Yet the big music
of the old Puritan bard has captivated and
enthralled every English reader with ears
on his soul for three centuries, and has
indirectly awakened a finer feeling and a
nobler thinking in millions of people. If
England were asked, even in this time of
war-stress, to sell her heritage of Milton’s
work to another nation for five millions, the
offer would be indignantly refused by men
who have never thrilled to a line of “Lycidas”
or heard the thunder-clash of Hell’s war-
riors as they applaud Satan’s call to awake
and arise. The national value of that work
is felt and known; yet Milton would have
been overjoyed to receive a prize of a couple
of hundred pounds from the State in recogni-
tion of the thing he was doing. On the
principle of paying cash for value received,
any State owes it to itself to reward the
person who is building up the great literary
assets which must bulk largely in the
balance-sheets of the future. It is not a
matter of charity or public benevolence, but
a plain business proposition.
As to the awarding of the prizes in such a
way as to make the efforts to win them
realty worth while, it would seem, on the
face of it, that the best people to make the
awards would be the men of letters them-
selves. Let a committee consisting of
various literary tradesmen be temporarily
appointed to hand out the first bonus or two,
and let each winner of a literary prize be
added permanently to that committee, while
one of its original members retires to give
him room. In this way a wholly literary
Board could soon be formed; and the dis-
tinction of having a place upon it would be
as attractive as the prize itself. All along
the line there would be a quickening of
the literary pulse, a feeling that the busy
pens realty mattered and that there was
something more important than the mere
winning of transient public appreciation.
The thing would have its effect on journal-
ism, too, and indirectly on the education of
the people. The Athenian crowd in the
theatre that could realty appreciate
Sophocles and catch every fine turn of
thought and expression owed its culture to a
great extent to the fact that its keen interest
in a contest had forced it to acquire a know-
ledge of what the contest was about. Such
a state of affairs can be largely re-created;
and the intelligent reading of the best in our
books, newspapers and magazines might soon
become a settled habit of the people. So the
average man in the street might in course of
time grow as enthusiastic over the melody of
a line of verse as he is to-day over the per-
formances of a pugilist.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Awakening.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Everyone is proud of being Australian now.”
—Australian soldier.
The day of trivial boasts is clone:
No more we shrink beneath the scorn
Of those who point to triumphs won
Before pur youngest land was born;
No more our wakened heart inclines
To worship gods at alien shrines.
The dream we dreamed in years of peace
In war’s red hell takes shape and form,
And doubts and dark forebodings cease
Amid the raging battle-storm,
Where by their faith our soldiers prove
They’ve found at last a land to love.
In new guise is old . wisdom dressed,
Into new flasks old wine is poured.
The truth that ancient folk expressed
In song and symbol and the sword —•
That after many a vagrant path
Man finds his soul at his own hearth.
No other soil can sacred be
Save that which gave his body birth,
Unless it house his spirit, he
Drifts homeless o’er a hostile earth;
A withered plant with no deep root
To nourish fragrance, flower or fruit.
A new pulse stirs the sleeping heart;
At last the painted idols fall ;
The huckster in exchange and mart,
The placeman in the council-hall
No more shall turn for tribute to
The land they neither loved nor knew.
No more the founts from which they drank
Will seem to spring from holy ground,
In old bush-wells our fathers sank
The haunted water shall be found
That, since the world of song began,
Waked wonder in the soul of man.
The stagnant deeps are stirred at last,
At last we know our fealty sure.
And when the rending storm is past
This, and this only, shall endure:
The love our fallen freely gave
To hills and plains that bred them brave.
VICTORIA.
VANCE PALMER.


The Greek that Wouldn’t.
Tin; situation which has arisen in the zone
where Turkey and Bulgaria are kept won-
dering what the Allies mean to do at
Salonika seems to indicate that the Greek
nation is better than its official figureheads
would lead the world to suppose. Con-
stantine’s policy of do-nothing-and-retire-
before-you-get-hurt doesn’t appeal to the
Greek soldier while there is a Bulgin' in
l it would probably appeal less if
11 ul&a l ' were replaced by a Turk.
► mall Greek forces, instead of sprinting for
the horizon at the invader’s approach, have
been standing their ground, fighting with all
the tury of hereditary hate, and turning an
(>ar S°ne suddenly deaf to the pathetic and
motherly appeals of Athens. After all,
something of the sort might have been ex-
pected. Constant!.\e is only one gen-
removed from the princedom
ot > chleswig-llolstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg
and Ins wife is the sister of the gentle" Wil-
tikem ; and how people with connections like
that cou.d be expected to understand Greeks
only the nations that hoisted the family to
tiie Hellenic throne might explain. Fxx-
GAt . the historian, who chose to become a
jieek and lose good British sweat working a
Greek farm, had a profound faith in the
peopk °f his adopted land. He maintained
that the modern Greek was in all essentials
the ancient Greek— that all the art.
literature and philosophy of the ancient was
something eternal, while the real greatness
ot the people depended on something per-
manent and unchangeable in the Greek man.
in his view the conquests of Alexander
were Greek—a great movement to carry the
municipal idea which had grown up in
Athens and the Peleponnesus to-the utmost
corners of the world. The spread of Chris-
tianity, too, he saw as wholly Greek; and
he counted the capture by it of the Roman
Bmpu'e to the credit of the Hellenic towns
and villages where the new faith, in its
European form, had been nurtured. If the
Greek nation of to-day has in it the old
elements and possesses the old dynamic force,
it must be pretty bad business to be bottled
up under Constantine and his German
missus, and refused a share in the world-
liberation which may take in Constantinople
and a lot of other places in its sweep. Like
the Spartan colonel at Platea who refused to
bring his regiment back even to gain an
advantage of position, on the ground that
Spartans never retreated, the Greek soldiers
beyond Salonika have started a war on their
own. It will be interesting to see whether
they are compelled to obey orders or whether
in spite of Constantine, Greece may take
lire and sweep in flame upon the Bulgar at
other points.
Metals and the War.
Prime Minister Hughes is much too hope-
ful when he says that the German has been
cut right out of the metal business. lie
hasn’t-not by a long way. You cannot cut
tt . Germa n out . unless you cut out the
u.S.A.: and that is a very big contract. One
cannot produce statutory declarations, of
course, in support of the statement; but
there is every reason to believe that the big
German metal firms not only are making as
much money as ever they did, but are
making as much or more out of Britain and
the Allies. They knew what was coming;
they had to know. And they simply trans-
ferred their efforts and a good deal of their
capital to the United States, where the
metallurgical business was already German
in the main. Some of the results we have
heard of already. Among them is the tre-
mendously important one that plants are
either ready or under construction capable
of supplying the whole of the world’s normal
requirements in zinc (spelter). And they
are entirely independent of us so far as raw
material is concerned. This means that we
shall be up against a more formidable com-
petitor than we ever had before. So far as
our producers are concerned, they had for-
merly. nothing much to complain of. In
handling our rarer metals and our gems the
Germans undoubtedly rooked us; but they
made better offers for our zinc and lead and
for some of our copper than we could get
elsewhere. The German-Ameriean, however,
will, as we have said, be independent of our
supplies; hence, unless the markets of
Britain at any rate, and possibly also of
out Allies, are closed to American metals,
our last state is likely to be worse than our
first. That means Protection, high Protec-
tion ; and unless Britain is prepared to take
that hurdle, very little else matters.
The Fuse of the Lions and the Lambs.
The S. M. Herald recently explained that it
was not the old Hughes who was coming
back to us. It was anew Hughes. And
if the changed Hughes remarked that com-
pulsory, military service should be part of
Australia’s policy, opposition was going to
disappear and “all classes, rich and poor,
high and low, will loyally follow their
leader. This glimpse of an old lady firmly
tying on her bonnet in readiness to rush out
and wave a patriotic brolly in a vast pro-
cession, behind Hughes is an inspiring thing.
J>iit military service is, after all, only one
item. There are a few other matters about
which the new Hughes or the same old
Hughes, or whatever he may be, has to be
heard from, and as the Herald is eager to
have him “dispel our delusions,” it seems a
reasonable thing to expect that eminently
1 expectable journal will publish something of
this sort soon :
Mr. Hughes has again struck a high note, calling
rni° P a im uT h ! te a a , e * lon ' . The presence of all these
Cocked Hats and the existence of Fourteen Houses
of Parliament in Australia is a scandalous waste and
a national fatuity. No possible excuse can he
advanced for continuing a system under which the
nT n tbl h e¥ r ee v ? r ?? nin » for 15 years. The veils
ot the State trighters are merely rowdy inter-
ruptions emanating from a contemptible clique of
paity barrackers We hope that Mr. Hughes will
T hIS cam Paign for Reconstruc-
tion, aid that all classes, rich and poor, high and
enduin' ' gl ' x ‘ him enthu siastie support at the Refer-
Again we have to express unqualified approval of
the policy of Mr. Hughes. His figures relating to the
weight of taxation resting on the shoulders of work-
mg men and women and the trifling impost placed
upon unearned land values, demand the earnest atten-
tion of eveiy citizen desirous.of settling our problems
on a basis of social justice. Indeed, we wonder that
our delusions have lasted so long, and are amazed
that these allied questions of land ownership, settle-
ment, taxation and industry have been so successfully
obscured in the past. The case for an increased
land tax, with the double purpose of relieving the
people of taxation and cheapening land, is unanswer-
able. Mr. Hughes can be assured of the unflinching
support of all classes, rich and poor, high and low,
in his campaign against an odious form of monopoly.
Then, of course, Joe Cook will stump the
country giving three cheers for Mr. Hughes,
and with a feeling of security the Federal
Parliament will emerge from hiding and do
something to earn its pay. At any rate, if
in regard to this matter these people are pre-
pared to sink differences and depend upon
the judgment of one man, what excuse are
they going to offer for opposing every mortal
thing he proposes at other times V If party
is a scandal to-day, what mysterious virtue
makes it less of a scandal to-morrow ?
The Girl Worker ami Her Sandwich.
The deputation Much asked the Minister
for Education to establish a woman’s hostel
in Sydney on the lines of those in London
and elsewhere, put a case which torpedoed
itself with some violence. The chief object
of the hostel, it was stated, would he to pro-
vide wholesome, healthful and hygienic
accommodation at a reasonable cost for girls
who have to earn their living away from
their own homes. These girls, the Minister
was assured, “have to pay nearly all their
wages to obtain miserable quarters, and are
compelled to live on cheap and inferior
food.” Clearly, if such a state of affairs
exists, the call is not for accommodation pro-
vided by the State, but for better wages for
women workers. If certain classes of em-
ployers are so underpaying the girls who
work for them that, as alleged, they cannot
live in a healthful and decent way, it would
be something like a national crime for the
State to assist in this exploitation of lauor.
The public money expended on the erection
of a hostel would be simply a cash subsidy
to the scoundrel who paid his girl-workers
less than they could decently live on. On
the other hand, a hostel for girl students
ought to be provided. The young woman
who comes up from the country to study, and
who has no parental purse to appeal to when
funds are short, both neeus and deserves a
place of the kind proposed. By her very
earnestness to learn something she has
already made good her right to this consid-
eration ; and in this age of splendid ignorance
and pride in ignorance, anybody who wants
to acquire any sort of knowledge ought to
get the best encouragement the State can
give. So the proposal of the Citizens’ Asso-
ciation wants chopping up into sections. If
the employees of the shoddy emporium are
starved and ill-housed, the shoddy person in
charge of the concern ought to be forced to
provide the cash necessary to enable them to
live decently; but a hostel for the women
workers who are not wage-earners is a
decent proposal which ought to be carried
into effect without delay.
Boom Railways and High Freights.
The Victorian railway figures ought to be
sufficient warning to the Holmans who rush
public works forward with money borrowed
at 5J per cent, and pay boom prices for
everything connected with every job. The
present N. S. Wales policy is exactly the
Victorian policy of over 20 years ago, and
the southern State is still paying for its out-
break of insanity. It owns to this day no
less than 28 lines of railway that don’t yield
exes., the total deficit thereon during the
last five years being £806,020. The worst
of the lot . was the Outer Circle line -
£69,550 —but the Glen Iris sin was a good
second, x with £56,885. In addition to this,
the State lias dismantled and pulled up the
rails of three or four* tracks. And all this
notwithstanding that heavy passenger and
goods charges are maintained in the struggle
to make ends meet —with the inevitable re-
sult, of course, of pauperising the country
producer and driving the people into the
already congested towns. Knibbs showed
that in 1911, before the* boom policy began
to have its effect on the fares in N. S.
ion M le Victorian was paying 10s. for a
jOO-mile ride, second-class, as against
os. Id. paid in N. S. Wales; 20s. for 200
miles as agiiinst 14s. 9d.; 38s. lOd. for 300
miles as against 2os. Sd. As for agricultural
freight, a 300-mile haul cost in N. S. Wales
10s. Od. per ton for a truck-load; whereas
in 1 ictoria, whose lines were built largely
in the boom years, under similar conditions
to those now afflicting N. S. Wales, the
charge was, 13s. 4d. per ton. And whereas
in N. ,S. Wales the lowest-class freight was
as. Bd. per ton for a 200-mile haul, in Vic-
toria. it was 11s. 3d. Already interest and
other costs have begun to tell their tale in
A. 8. Wales, and higher fares and freights
are now collected; and it seems inevitable
that within a very few years N. S. Wales
will have to thank these pseudo-Labor profli-
gates for just as high charges as the Vic-
torians have been burdened with largely as
a result of tlieir boom.

1 he dispute between the N.S.W. Education
department and the BALA, has roused the
Sydney Telegraph to indignation. Grif-
fith says he will break up the strike of the
doctors, even if—he adds quite unnecessarily
and father foolishly—he has to import
Chinamen to use the stethoscope and pre-
scribe the blue pill, “liow much further.”
thereupon asks the Telegraph, “is that prin-
ciple to go? We have had strikes in this
country, the object of which was to prevent
the public from getting food and other neces-
saries of life until unionists were given their
own way and non-unionists ostracised. Or
is there to be one law for the striker who
injures the public in shirt sleeves, and
another for the striker who does the same
thing in a black coat?” But does the Syd-
ney paper imply that because the law has
not been decently enforced in one case a
malignant opposition to the public good
should go unchallenged in another? Two
blacks laid side by side do not make a
crimson ; and the mere awaking of a Govern-
ment at a single point to some real concern
for the general rights of the citizen ought to
cause a moderate amount of joy rather than
be received with wrath and contempt. The
strikers who block supplies of public food
ought to be treated to doses of the axe, and
the doctors who set themselves against a
reform affecting the children of the State
should have the same medicine. That the
healthy instrument of commonsense wasn’t
forcefully applied in one case is no reason
why it should be neglected in the other.
Besides, there is a difference. Any court of
justice in handing out punishment takes some
account of the criminal’s education and
standing. The offence of a leading intellect
m the community in grave moral matters is
regarded, and rightly regarded, as a more
serious thing than the same offence com-
mitted by slum dwellers. The butcher’s
man who goes on strike for more wages may
take the ground that if the public won’t give
him enough cash to buy meat it can try what
it is like to go without meat. But can the
BALA, take the same stand and. say that
because the public won’t give it enough cash
to buy health, the children of the State shall
go without health? The mere statement of
the case is sufficient to show its absurdity.
Lor all the special pleading of the Tele-
graph, this is a case in which Griffith
is plainly right and the B.M.A. most wrong.

LTjt, under the joint rule of the Colonial
Sugar Refining Cos. and the Methodist Con-
ference, grows restive and stretches out its
hands in an appeal for change. Exactly
wliat it wants has never been very clear.
W. A. Holman came home the other day
with information that 600 out of 900 elec-
tors wanted annexation to Australia or
Maoriland. The accuracy of the figures has
been denied; indeed, considering the num-
ber of the electors who must be bosses either
in Methodism or in molasses, the proportion
seems high. Nevertheless, the petition is not
the first of its kind, and there must be some
cause when an insular population (insular
populations being notoriously parochial)
desires to be absorbed in a bigger concern.
Australia could not take on the job with
any enthusiasm; but Maoriland, with its
brown empire already spreading-out like a
swarm of bees across the Pacific, might find
it worth while. To look after 76 coral fly-
specks and 18 volcanic humps might be pro-
portionately cheaper than to attend to six
palm-girt dots and two smoking cones; so,
the Maoriland empire being already in exist-
ence, it might suit to take Fiji in as an
additional paddock to be mortgaged. Be-
sides, the Dominion knows a lot about the
problem of the non-working native, and
generally contrives to give him as fair a deal
as lie deserves.

“Gouger" : The Bulletin might have
made the case against Hughes’s metal
combine blacker and still not have overdone
it. M e are practically compelled to send
to one works, because the other is not buy-
ing and we may not export. We are not
being paid on the basis of standard copper.
On May 3 they notified sellers they would
pay for copper at the forward or three
months’ price less £lO per ton, and these
are the terms they are still buying on.
Under these conditions we get nearly half
the value of the copper contents! Hughes
may have saved us from the Germans. But
we don’t find it any pleasanter to be broiled
by an Australian combine than fried bv a
German ring.
“F.C.’s ’ story of another combine:—
There are not many producers who have so
thoroughly cut competition out of their business as
the fruit-growers of Miidura. This River irrigation
colony is the head and centre of Australia’s dried-
fruit growing industry, and its yield this year was
about 12,000 tons, almost a record. Renmark,
Merbein and other places brought the total output
to 15,000 tons. As the Australian consumption of
diicd fruits currants, sultanas, raisins, apricots’, etc
—has never exceeded 8000 tons, the 'deaj- old Taw of
supply and demand should have brought prices down
to bedrock ; but the Australian Dried Fruits Associa-
tion ordered otherwise. It 'doesn’t believe In the
“bracing atmosphere of open competition.” It knows
that, in these days, to hunt safely you must hunt in
packs. Its delegates therefore meet annually about
February, and after cabling to the Cold Land and
making a few calculations as to the cost of importa-
tion should such be attempted, they say that the
prices for the year will be so and so. This year,
though 4M. and sd. per lb. might have paid the
growers very well, the Ass. raised prices for sul-
tanas to SJd. and currants to 7id. per lb. This
season it exported most of its surplus over the Aus-
tralian consumption ; but in other years a lot of it
goes to distillers. The Ass. attends to them, too;
this season it raised the rate for low-grade distilling
iruit from £lB to £25. Of course, none of this is
pleasant for the consumer, and the Ass. has many
bricks thrown at it. But they are mostly thrown in
the interests of the city; and it is nearly time the
small country producer had a turn. If its result is
to make that fellow’s job a bit more profitable and
his life a lot more tolerable, it would have to be a
particularly vicious scheme that would deserve a
brick.
Acting on the impulse of E. J. Brady
most commercially-minded of Australian
writers, Vance Palmer, Edward Dyson
and some others have formed the nucleus
ot an Authors and Writers’ Guild with the
prime object of getting Parliament to take
decisive action with regard to the flood of
outside fiction which pours into Australia—
not to mention the Australian writer's old
enemy, the syndicated story. There is no
intention to restrict the import of intellec-
tual and educational books and periodicals
as some sensitive pedagogues seem to fear!
L ariiament will only be asked to stem the
How of the deadly stuff which is filling
the national mind with imported ideals and
deadening the national conscience to " the
importance of our own. What is wanted,
tailing a direct duty or a thorough-going-
copyright law which latter is apparently
not permitted by our Constitution—is li
proclamation similar to the one published
in the London Gazette of Feb. 15, declar-
ing that “no periodical of more than l(j
pages may be imported into this country
except through the Post Office.” Some-
thing like that would be proper Protection
indeed, and if enforced in the Common-
wealth it would not shut out anything of
real value. At present about £1,000.000
worth ot popular” literature is imported
in bulk to Australia per annum. Without
yielding much to the Customs or benefiting
the country in an intellectual way, this
means slow starvation to Australian
writers, who either shut up their brains or
take them to some foreign market.
IriE old Melbourne Tramway Co.’s lease
has run out, and the business is now under-
stood to be controlled by the State Govern-
ment, or a Tramway Board, or something;
but the cars run in exactly the same silly
old way as before. They are forever stop-
ping at obscure street corners to pick up
somebody who comes puffing along in the
distance with an agonised expression and a
gesticulating brolly. In the city, within a
quarter of a mile there are six elastic stop-
pages. The car mills up on either side of
T hnders-street, Collins-street and Bonrke-
street, and anybody tramming into the heart
oi the metropolis, from any point of the
compass, can get off and race the car for at
least 440 yards. The system, from begin-
ning to end, is a ridiculous waste of time
and money. There has never been any con-
ceivable reason why cable-tram passengers
should not be subject to the same rules as
electric-tram passengers, and now that the
long reign of the old eo. is ended it is time
the venerable lady with the agitated gamp
was denied the right to stop the car wher-
ever she pleases.
Times are alleged to be hard and are cer-
tainly going to be harder. In the interests
of national efficiency, which is said to be
necessary for our salvation, pubs are now
shut at six o’clock in two States and not
much later in four others. Commonwealth
Ministers echo what those of Britain have
said, and call for individual economy. The
(ustoms Department has shut down abso-
lutely on the import of jewellery. But the
draper s window is just as beautiful as ever
and the bait the fluff merchant lays in the
morning papers is as greedily taken. Quite
as much money is still spent in buying
unnecessary clothes as ever was spent in
buying unnecessary beer. Now what are
we going to do about this waste? The pub-
lican has had his trading hours reduced by
one-third. The pubs are open now during
the hours when it is least convenient for
the average man to reach them. Are we
going to ho fair all round and apply the
same principles to this other wasteful trade?
If not, why not? It is surely time the male
worm turned and made use of the valuable
lesson which fair and not-so-fair woman has
lately taught him. Then interference with
personal liberty will become a trifle less
popular,-perhaps, than it is at present.

The impressions of a good Australian who
has been looking at them once more:—
One's first and lasting impression of the United
States is that of an overcrowded country. It is not
so big as Australia, yet it contains 100 million
people. Its cities are too full of people prone to
crush and crowd and hustle and jostle. The Ameri-
cans. are utterly unlike the Australians. They arc
so new, so frcs.i, so ignorant. The majority come
from the helot races of Europe, and their grand-
fathers were serfs, hewers of wood and drawers of
water. In this new country they have come quickly
into the right to live and the right to work, with
the consequent right to have and to hold.
They are not Anglo-Saxons and they are not a
white people, for they include negroes, Mexicans,
Japanese, Chinese and Indians, with a strong section
of Huns. The 22 million Huns in the 100 millions
of population run the United States in finance and
largely in industry, and they are breeding like
rabbits. In 25 years from now they will start out
to imitate Billy Hohenzollernl because with 200
million inhabitants the German-American Republic
will be overcrowded uncomfortably.
Their “preparedness” parades astonished Die Aus-
tralian onlooker. Why, half the people who carried
flags and marched for hours in thousands were black,
brown, yellow, and black and tan! But the American
is'always parading and flag-wagging; lie does it
mostly from vanity and conceit. While I was there
50,000 “knights templar” marched through the
main streets of Los Angeles wearing cocked hats
with 12-inch ostrich feathers and toy swords; and
200,000 people stood by to see them do it. In the
The Days When a King Went Mad.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In his march from the crude primeval ape,
through the forest of years gone by,
Man’s brain grew slowly to guide his ways,
and his myriad wants supply—-
To dig the copper, the iron and gold, and
fashion from stone or wosd
The things that helped in the weary chase for
safety and warmth and food;
Arid ever its waxing powers marched true to
the call of each new-born need,
And he spun the fibre, and wove the wool,
and planted and reaped the seed;
lie harnessed the lightning and furrowed the
foam, he sifted the good from bad,
And higher and wider his vision swept, till
the days when a king went mad.
Then down from the mountains of high
desire, where science kept pace with
skill,
The. nations tramped to the fields of strife'.
with the savage’s lust to kill :
And every triumph of brain and hand, each
fruit of a. toil-won lore.
Was turned to serve in the dance of Death,
to redden the earth with gore;
Bullet and bayonet, bursting shell, mine,
motor and aeroplane.
Warship and cruiser and submarine, to add
to the hosts of slain.
With little reck for the work of years, with
less for the wealth he had.
Man shot and slaughtered, and hacked and
hewed, in the days when a king went
mad.
Cities crumpled before his wrath, temples
and towns were razed,
And wonten and children starved and died
as the far-flung war-fires blazed :
lie sank his mines and he wrecked the fields
where the blood-soaked trenches ran.
And most that man by his toil had built was
smashed to the dust by man;
Metal and timber and fuel and food, blown
to the winds away,
And a mighty debt in their stead piled high
for the sons of man to pay.
Honor and glory and blood and tears, pale
orphans and widows sad—-
And what will they think in the days to come,
of the days when a king went mad?

The Yankee thinks in dollars; that is, in four
and tuppences. Wages are high and so are rents
and food. Everything is dear from our standpoint,
and growing dearer. One is inclined to believe
these people to be right in keeping up a high stan-
dard of living. We Australians could raise our
standards and pay better wages, higher salaries and
fees, and more for our food and clothes if we also had
high Protection and plenty of technical schools.
For what the Americans can do Australians can do
better. All round the Australians are better bred
and better fed. Though the efficiency of the United
States people is a myth, yet they do tilings. We
Australians prefer to talk about great enterprises
and reward the talker for talking to us.
There is something more to be said about
that process for making horseshoes at the
rate of up to 72 a minute —a process which
was formerly in use in S. Melbourne, but
is idle now because the union thought it
allowed of the employment of too much
unskilled labor and turned out too many
shoes, anyway. Lately TI. V. McKay and
others investigated the process and were
astonished at what it could do. “Here’s a
chance,” they said, “for the Defence Depart-
ment” —the Department whose head has
talked a lot about “national efficiency.” But
they didn’t know the Defence Department.
Instead of getting encouragement they got
merely a long official wriggle.
Prime Minister Hughes’s conversion to
pools and combines is very popular in quar-
ters that ought to make him suspicious. The
Rochester (Vie.) farmers now want the
Government to help them create one in pigs.
Holman, referring to the I.W.W. as an
insignificant organisation with only 500
members in Sydney and 200 at Broken Hill,
makes the sort of mistake a Labor man who
has been through the mill should never make.
One of the most sensational elections in
which Holman’s crowd was ever engaged was
fought to victory by a branch league that
possessed only 37 members. And the hand-
ful of avowed members of the I.W.W. have a
fanaticism which surpasses even that of the
early Laborites.
The N.S.W. State coal mine is not going
to be blocked altogether by the refusal of the
Uppish House to pass the Bill recently
before it. That Bill was for the purpose of
enabling the Government to acquire certain
lands necessary to give access to the mine.
Estell now remarks cheerfully that such
areas can be secured later; and. meantime,
the opening of the mine and the construction
of the railway will proceed.
Frank Foster may make a reappearance in
politics after the next N. S. Wales State
elections. Foster, who was a strong A.W.U.
man, captured the New England House of
Reps, seat, and his subsequent loss of it was
one of the few unpleasant shocks received by
Labor at the last elections. Now, having
been chosen as Labor candidate for Wollon-
dilly in the State Parliament, he is out to
beat George Fuller. The seat in normal
times is Liberal, but just at present there
are a few thousand convenient navvies there-
abouts. The case illustrates another of the
beauties of the insane party system. If the
other crowd holds a seat with a good man
you put up a good man against him. Any
old hack will do to run against a poor
opponent. Thus you make sure that the
House will have only one of two good men.
and be equally sure of getting one of two
asses.
The reported decision of Lieut. W. Downie
Stewart, a Maoriland M.P. now doing his
bit at the Front, to refuse a position on the
staff of General Russell and stick to his job
in the trenches, sounds just the sort of thing
Stewart would do. He is the son of an
earlier Downie Stewart, and head of the
legal firm of Downie Stewart and Payne in
Dunedin. Serious mindedness was a charac-
teristic of young Downie—it was notable
even in Dunedin —and he took his law and
his politics and everything else in the same
solemn way. He could always bo relied on
to do the Right and Proper Thing—after due
consideration.
Justice Heydon, of the Arbitration Court,
was 71 on August 25 —and N.S.W. unionists
begin to think him too old for the job. His
Honor was 30 when he was called to the
Bax% and 48 when he became George Dibbs’s
Attorney-General. Three years later (1890)
he was selected sole commissioner for con-
solidating the statute law of N. S. Wales,
and became a Q.O. He succeeded the
greatly-esteemed Cohen as President of the
Arbitration Court in 1905.

“The Land of Promise,” now at Melbourne
Royal, is an odd-made play with brightness
in the dialogue, force in the o’ iracterisation,
and a good deal of truth in me story. Any-
thing written by Somerset Maugham, author
of “Lady Frederick,” could hardly be less
than that. As a play it is weak at its two ends,
for all that is essential in the prologue
scene, laid in England, might have been
written into the subsequent story ot
Canadian life, and the closing scene is dull
and conventional. In its present produc-
tion “The Land of Promise” is four phases
of Miss Madge Fabian. Firstly she is the
refined young person, sometime companion
and nurse to an old woman, just deceased, who
was expected to leave her a snug annuity.
But her hopes are blighted and she decides
to go to Canada to live with her brother, a
struggling farmer in Manitoba. When she
gets among people accustomed to work, the
refined young person, is rather up against
the new order of civilisation. Moreover,
her brother’s vulgar, jealous wife is up
against her. Finally the practical farm-
wife makes things so unpleasant for the
high-spirited, quick-tongued, dainty girl from
England that she offers to go right away, as
wife, with a young farmer visitor who wants
a helpmate on his 160-acre property further
up-country. The girl Norah has nothing in
common with Frank Taylor save force of
character. When he takes her off to his
cheerless shack like another Petruchio
bringing home his Katharine, he starts to
subdue her spirit by even cruder means than
Katharine’s husband adopted. He com-
mands her to sweep up, and forces honey-
moon endearments upon the bride who has
no thought of fondness for him. In the
position of helpless slave to a reasonable,
manly master, Norah grows unconsciously
reconciled to her lot. It is dignified by the
freedom of the -prairie and the pervading
sense of social equality, as compared with
“genteel” life in the Old Country. A long
Canadian winter of propinquity with a
decent, healthy man has changed her Eng-
lish ideals whilst developing her capacity for
toil, and when, in his hour of adversity, she
gets the chance to return to the narrow
refinements of luxurious drudgery to which
she had bee.n educated, she prefers to stay
and be the helpmate of her rugged lord and
master.
* * * *
Miss Fabian’s Norah is interesting, though
not quite convincing in her colonial experi-
ences. She never gets away from her
“weary Gwendoline” style of niceness. She
remains unduly trim and neat under rough
ITALIAN GRAND OPERA.

conditions. Nor is there sufficient strength
of passion in her futile rebellion against the
fate she has imposed upon herself. She is
strongest in her least eniotional moments,
but she is always the dominating character.
Frank Harvey, as the monotoned Petruchio
up-to-date, contrives to get the audi-
ence’s sympathy without diverting commis-
eration from his rather unamiable wife.
Sydney Stirling gives a capital sketch of the
heroine’s brother who has married an ener-
getic vixen: and Miss Boswell makes an
effective vixen, notwithstanding that her
elocution is much too measured and her
vixenishness often melodramatic. _ In minor
character parts the most artistic work is
done by Greenaway, Rita Aslin, 1 rank
Harcourt, Maggie Knight and Leonard
Stephens. The last-named plays a stereo-
typed English johnnie w T aster, and because
he is the only cheerful person in the piece
the audience loves to hear him express his
deplorable sentiments. Intelligent people
will find the “Land of .Promise” worth con-
sidering, and the stupidest will be struck
by its appeal to their matrimonial instincts.
The last result of 10 weeks’ opera in Mel-
bourne was “The Huguenots,” chiefly notable
for the fine singing of Balboni, the charming
ballet music, and a couple of convincing
backcloths. The performance was ragged in
the places where careful rehearsal counts
most, and it suffered in the last scene from
want of volume in the tremolous voice and
wild abandon in the acting of Mrs. De
Itevers as the distracted Valentine, who was
supposed to be imploring her tenor lover to
stay away from the Massacre. Also, the in-
cident of the lady’s father (Belloni) ordering
the young couple to be shot was not made
clear, so the climax fell a bit flat. The first
two acts were more enjoyable in a musical
sense than the last two. However, the old-
fashioned individuality of Meyerbeer’s com-
position always makes “The Huguenots”
worth while. Filippini, as the gallant bari-
tone, sang better than he acted, the trusty
Cacialli was an efficient Marcel, and Visoni
scored in the tuneful, but colorless, part of
the Queen. Miss Russ, in flaxen curls, was
a plump and pleasing Page, but she made
very little of the famous song that is often
heard on the concert platform. If her wob-
bling warble were not sweet it would be un-
pardonable.
Gonsalez led his opera flock to Sydney at
the week-end and opened the season in
Verdi’s “Trovatore.” Marlow’s Grand
Opera House (nee Adelphi) was crowded
for the event. When the curtain rolled up
the chorus tramped on to listen to and abet
basso Cacialli, a benign Ferrando with his
head bagged in a mediaeval Balaclava.
Cacialli has the comfortable appearance of
an alderman in a good way of business,
with a rich voice and an unctuous manner.
He was an immediate success. The tenor,
Cappelli, is young and beautiful. A charmer
to begin with, he goes all the way with a
ringing, full-throated voice that has none
of the sugary sweetness which often mars his
Find. He is a d.screet young man, too, and
never seizes his girl—her name is Leonora
—to kiss her. Occasionally he permits the
lady to lay her head on the air within a
few inches' of his breast. But this is only
in a crisis. Leonora de Revers needs all
the orchestra can do to drown her sharp
metallic tones. She is a small, impassioned
soprano and keeps things moving. But her
vocal machinery needs oiling. The gipsy
Azucena (Miss Russ) gave a strong-
dramatic but vocally weak representation of
the villainess. Her tremolo is so insistent
that it quivers through a melodious light
contralto to its undoing. The tall
Scamuzzi is a delightful baritone, and he
made Count de Luna an agreeable bad egg.
As conductor Gonsalez is quite different
from any/other dragon we have seen. He
keeps his orchestra up to the mark with
unruffled hair and serene countenance. Late
arrivals bump his back as he steers the
tenor to the top flight: things are dropped
in the adjacent stalls. But he gives no sign
of an eruption. Without a score he leads
his company as peacefully as a shepherd
leads young lambs. An efficient male
chorus (later we get the silk stockings) did
its best. This week the co. quick-changes
to “Travifita.”
Maggie Dickinson does so well in the
name-part of “The Dancing Mistress” at
Sydney Majesty’s that one marvels at the
J.C.W. people finding so little use for her.
She wins through with the solo work, acts
with charm and dances perfectly. Nellie
Payne, the other young Australian, swaggers
prettily in trousered riding-costume in the
first act, and floats like a skirted Dana Gib-
son dream in the final dance. With Dorothy
Brunton looking towards the siren U.S.A.,
Nellie’s chance seems to be approaching.
Minnie Love, whose Scotch accent has been
severely criticised by the press McHaggises
(she was stage-Irish last week), is one of
those rare imitations that are better than
the real article. Her star number, “I’m
Havin’ a Richt Guid Time,” would delight
the elders of any kirk, and the accompany-
ing dance in a beautifully improbable High-
land costume is all grace and humor. Phil
Smith is at home in a butler’s job with
patter to match: Leslie Holland, as the
aviator-lover, dashes about gallantly with
his hat set at the angle the advertisement
artist loves; Reg Roberts drawls until it
seems like incipient lockjaw; Derek Hudson
has just one song in the plainclothes of a
musical-comedy bad baron; and Maggie
Moore earns the usual welcome as , the
French mistress who gambles. Mrs. George
Lauri (Miss Pindrop) is a terribly lifelike
she-principal, and Alfred Andrew’s make-up
as the old Italian singing master is so com-
plete that one grieves to lose him. The
“book” has blue spots and some humor, the
brisk music good patches, and the scenery is
diversified as well as fresh. The revival
should easily be worth its allotted two
weeks.
“DUNCAN McCLURE AND THE POOR
PARSON,” AT SYDNEY ROYAL.
Bill Eaglefoot (Fred MacDonald) presents
his bride (Lily Adeson) with an alarm
clock and an axe.
The small boy of the future is going to
have a treat every time history-lesson comes
round, for the schoolroom will be darkened
and the moving-picture machine will get to
work. Then will printed histories be read
with interest, for they will fill out the pic-
ture version which has collared the young -
imagination. Crick and Jones, a new Aus-
tralian picture-making firm, have started
seriously on the job of canning Australian
history for school and other purposes, and
their first big five-reeler, “The Mutiny of the
Bounty,” was shown last Friday at Sydney
Tivoli, with George Cross in the lead as
Bligh. A big job has been tackled credit-
ably, and, apart altogether from its interest
for Australians, the fine photography and
the acting of the cast give the picture a
strong artistic appeal. Hoyt’s are showing
ic in Sydney.
“Duncan McClure and the Poor Parson”
are now in their fourth week at Sydney
Ifoyal and the police on night duty say that
the theatre looks like a disturbed ants’-nest
when the show is coming out.
With Myrtle Tannehill always in the lead
of “Too Many Cooks” at Sydney Criterion,
this poor American comedy might have had
a chance : but the change took place only
last Saturday, and by that time the broth
was spoiled. Hence there are only two
more nights of the Cook Family, and on
Saturday evening “Get-Rich-Quick Walling-
ford” will be put on. with Hale Hamilton,
who created the role in N’Yark, as Walling-
ford.
Sydney Tivoli acquired three new turns
last week-end, but the whole lot together
don’t amount to one South American revo-
lution : Wilbur, a singing tramp; Dan
Ahern, a fiddling whistler; and Kelly and
Fern, who have a comedy act. The rest of
the show-people have been mentioned before,
and if any Tivolian wants to know who
they are he will find their names painted up
outside the theatre opposite the times at
which they may be expected.
On the Sydney screen this week :
Lyceum : “The Captive God,’’ a first-class Triangle
story of the Aztecs; “Stranded,” in which a staid
old Shakspearian actor discovers his Juliet on a
trapeze; and Charlie Chaplin in “The Fireman.” For
day sessions, commencing on Monday—“ Neptune's
Daughter,” the Annette Ivellerman picture.
Crystal Palace : “Mary Sunshine,” featuring
Mary Osborne as the slum child who was fortunate
enough to become lost in a mansion ; and Chaplin’s
“Fireman.”
Empress: An official war film, “Observing for Out-
Big Guns” ; and “Me and Me Mate,” in which a
Cockney finds cabbages more payable than Art.
Lyric : “The Eye of the Night,” a thrilling light-
house story, including some Zep frightfulness.
It is difficult to speak respectfully of the
entertainment which# happened at Melbourne
Princess’s on Saturday. The show, which
is advertised as “The Follies of Pleasure”
and is divided into two sections labelled

A Night in Bohemia” and ‘‘Fun in a
Studio,” is mainly a mixture of inferior
vaudeville specialties and ragtime noises,
without sufficient snap or originality to
stir the least critical into any enthusiasm.
The brightest feature of the performance is
the frequent irruption of a mostly-Austra-
lian chorus, whose pink, palpitating comeli-
ness is flagrantly misused as a background
tor seedy songs and tame comedy business.
The Yankee principals, who are responsible
tor the songs and business, are, in most
cases, undeserving of the fine physical sup-
port that the management has provided.
Miss Eileen Barnsley sings two or three
songs; miss Madge Moore, a soubrette,
seeks to hit the eye with the chromatic
marvels of her wardrobe; Miss Lilyan
Mason, a massive comedienne, who empha-
sises her proportions by appearing in tights,
vises an indifferent voice to bring the
Amurkan language into further disfavor.
Of the men, Murray J. Simons is an
unassuming specialist in the humor of the
Amurkan Hebrew. Seemingly Ins job is to
assault his colleagues with Yiddish banter.
Next to him in point of importance is
Lew Dunbar, who is funny in spots, and
indelicate in others. A couple of balancers
n>. the last scene are very clever, but the
other males in the co. are either monoto-
nous or grotesque. Two of them are
almost freakish; another achieves a sensa-
tion by expectorating a mouthful at Mr.
Dunbar. When Dunbar shows his apprecia-
tion by describing the offender as a "sewer,”
The Bulletin feels that nothing more
need be said against “The Follies of
Pleasure.”
At Melbourne King’s the moral of “Peg”
is just as unintended as usual. The simple
little comedy seems to prove that the one
thing required to bring out the charm of a
wild Irish-American girl is to put her with
a eoldly-eorrective bunch of perfidious
baxons for three months, at the end of which
period the jewel is duly polished and vastly
improved. Teg’s brief sojourn among the
Chichesters works wonders.
A dozen or more turns at Melbourne Tivoli
make a reasonably good bill wherein is
nothing new or startling. Cardo and Noll
command the largest space in the advt., and
those melodious foreigners are, with the ex-
ception of Vaude and Verne, the most
familiar items in the sum total.
“The Girl in the Train” has nearly fin-
ished her journey at Melbourne Majesty’s.
On Saturday she will leave the track and be
“The Girl on tke_ Film” for six nights only.
The. Melba matinee in aid of theatrical
charities is now definitely fixed for Friday,
September 8.
. The Prodigal Son figures again in “Blue
Blood and Red,” a Wild West romance
screened by Hoyt’s in Melbourne. The boy,
banished by his wealthy parent for his reck-
less behavior, strikes out for the West,
where he finds in cow-puncliing and a lovely
summer girl the true happiness that he
misses during his gaieties in town. After
two or three acts of adventure, he marries
the girl and raises a family, and in the
last chapter goes home to lonely old father,
who plays a big part in a reunion tableau
decorated with kisses and kids. The photo-
graphy is excellent, and the incidental
cattle-branding and other ranch scenes
make a convincing background.

Adelaide theatres are waking up after a
sleepy period. Evelyn Scotney, at Exhibi-
tion or Town Hall, has s.owly but effectu-
ally broken down the dubious attitude usual
in Adelaide towards musicians unknown to
it; and the Tivoli for one glad evening
auctioned interminably a single flag, while
charity uncovered a multitude of shins in
amateur dances, tableaus and processions.
Brandon Cremer had charge of the profes-
sional side of this big “gala,” and Hanley
Murray of the amateur side. Now the
Tivoli has reopened with a strong William
Anderson co.. headed by Mackay and
Redgrave, and the King’s with a bright
American “Flirting Widow” musical extra-
vagance from Ben ,T. Fuller, who competes
against himself at the Majestic with variety,
much strengthened by Wish Wynne. The
Royal keeps to its strong uncomfortable
pictures, but promises Julius Knight
shortly. At the Queen’s Dampier and his
Dandies are the same, or more so, for Irene
\ ere has come back into the bill.
“Hussar” : Latest list of killed in France
includes Lieut. F. Pusch, D. 5.0., Irish
Guards. A fine lad, he was 'one of my
subalterns in the “Terriers” when we went
to Flanders in January, ’l5, and was the
actual first into Loos (25/9/T5). He killed
Huns with his own “gun,” got the
D.b.0., and was transferred to the Irish
Guards. Now he is dead, and only 19.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Melb”: For an Australian there has
never been any cinepicture with such a
painful grip as that dealing with the poet
“the STROLLERS,” AT SYDNEY
PALACE.
James and Desmond in opera,.
Gordon, just shown privately here. Trainor
of Brighton (Vic.), a chum 0 f Gordon’s,
declares that poet Hugh McCrae, a relative,
acting the part of Gordon, is perfect, the
very man. I irst, we see Gordon in Scot-
land, and the scarcely-known love episode
that influenced his after life. Then his S Aus-
tralian career, as trooper and legislator.
1 here is his famous leap, with vraisemblance
enough* Then his steeplechasing. So far
as is possible, his work as poet, too. And
lastly—out into the dark !
Private Boxer”: I hope I am not chort-
ling: too soon, but it really looks as if the
native writer is getting a foothold in the
Australian theatre at last. Nothing succeeds
like success, and the Bert Bailey crowd hav-
ing. proved that profits can be realised from
other than Yankee productions, several man-
agements (always, of course, excepting the
hirin’’) are sailing in with home-grown
goods. E. J. Carroll, who pulled the strings
tor “Bunty” in Australia, is soon to introduce
Henry Lawson’s “While the Billy Boils.’’
adapted for the stage by Beaumont Smith.
.Dennis is busy shaping his “Sentimental
Bloke into a play. Bert Bailey, after he has
finished with his present Steele Rudd money-
maker, “Duncan Maclure,” will try more
local stuff. A play by the late Jack Ramsay,
a Sumner Locke comedy (adapted from her
bookstall favorite, “Mum Dawson, Boss”)
and another Rudd comicality—“ Grandpa’s
Selection” this time—are among his bunch
In a few months playgoers will have got quite
used to seeing the names of Australian
authors on the bills.
“Masetto”: Meyerbeer’s showy opera.
“The Huguenots,” with which the Gonsalez
family concluded its Melbourne season, had
not been heard here since the Simonsens did
it at the old Alexandra, 25 years ago, with
about the best cast ever heard in Australia.
Lyster produced it in his early impresario
days with Lucy Escott, Rosalie Durand,
Georgia Hodson and others, helped by a
good orchestra and a chorus of 50 voices—
pretty fair for 18G2! Another notable revi-
val was in 1873 with Giulia Coy, Beaumont,
Dondi, and others. The first-named is pro-
bably the only one living now of the troupe.
It was at a performance of “The Huguenots”
at the Opera House in 1880 that an injured
husband named Greer shot at and wounded
his wife and the gay Lothario—a Frenchman
named Poudry. He then turned the weapon
on himself, and successfully, too, as he died ;
but the other shooting was bad, and both
parties recovered.
“O K.”: Up to 40 years ago the British
stage villain was mostly a hypocrite who
wanted to worm himself into the heroine’s
good graces. More recently he has taken a
delight in doing everything possible to get
himself disliked. Judging by the plot of “La
Gioconda” (perverted from one of Victor
Hugo’s dramas) the unspeakable miscreant
was introduced to London in Italian opera.
The bad man in love with the prima donna
makes no attempt to overcome her aversion
to him. When she declines his violent pro-
posals he accuses her blind mother of witch-
craft, with a view to getting the old lady
burned at the stake. After this he becomes
friendly with the prima donna again, and she
undertakes to marry him in consideration of
services rendered. But his hope of attaining
his amorous end makes no difference to his
plans respecting poor blind mother. His pro-
mised bride stabs herself to the heart in pre-
ference to marrying him ; but ere she is quite
dead he has the satisfaction of telling the
young woman that he strangled her mamma
before hastening to the wedding. Only in
melodrama would a villain dream of winning
his wife’s love by murdering her mother on
their marriage morn.
“Kaniva”: Somebody says the Gonsalez
season in Melbourne makes a record for
Italian opera. Well, let’s see. Simonsen’s
rare company, at the Alexandra Theatre in
1891, sang for 84 nights and did 13 operas.
Cagh and Pompei, at the old Princess’s
Theatre in 1871, did 81 nights and 18
operas. From the Gonsalez brethren we
have had 79 performances and 18 operas.
So they tie for the greatest number of works
and run third for length of season.
The name of Eugene Alderman, the Adelaide
violinist, who never quite grew up but died
a boy and everybody’s friend at 31, is to be
perpetuated by some sort of a violin scholar-
ship. If funds permit, it will take the holder
to Europe. Failing that—Adelaide Univer-
sity.
. Miss Jones, a Westralian gill who was
billed to give recitals of Australian bush
stories in the Playhouse, had a sad experi-
ence which prevented her appearing. She
suffered a sudden and severe nervous break-
down, completely lost her memory, and was
taken to a hospital by someone who dis-
covered her in the street.
“Peter”: One member of the Gonsalez Co.
who did not get his fair share of adulation
in Melbourne was Count Filippini, the blue-
blooded baritone. His Grace only appeared
in about half a dozen operas, but every time
he sang he revealed a voice that never once
disgraced its noble origin. Personally I
prefer him to the belauded Scamuzzi, who is
certainly superior in dramatic qualities, but
lacks my man’s artistic conscience. Scamuzzi
is not above warbling passages with gorgeous
flourishes, just to flatter the perspicacity of
the musical Nuts who had infallibly picked
him out as a genius before competent critics
had time to estimate his calibre. Filippini,
on the other hand, never misreads the music
for popular effect. A scrupulous respect for
the composer’s intentions prevents him
indulging in fireworks. The Count’s front
name, by-the-bye, is Hercules, and he only
requires about two feet more each way to
look it.

Janet Gumleaves writes from “Some-
where in France” :—•
We still don’t get enough Bulletins for the boys.
If your readers would pass on their copies—any old
copies—-to No. 1 Australian General Hospital they
would he most gratefully received. We’ll take , care
that Billjim gets them And can’t my country
evolve a face powder, scented with wattle, for home-
sick feminine exiles? Personally, I’d give all 1
possess—about 20 francs—for a streak of Australian
sun. The old thing they have here doesn’t know
how to light up the world.
Alfred Ilea kin has been ordered a sea
voyage, and this week leaves with his wife
for England. 11 is health has been anything
but good since his unusually complete retire-
ment from public life, and his memory some-
times plays him treacherous tricks. But lie
is still the urbane and courteous Alfred
whom Victoria has always known —an
Alfred for whom even his worst political
enemies could not bring themselves to
harbor anything but affection.
From a Westralian girl:—
Hugo Throssell, V.C., received many presentations
when he got back ; but the greatest fanfare happened
at Northam, where he lived before he put on khaki.
The instigators of the show were the W.C.T.U.
women—co-workers of the V.G'.’s mother. They
unfurled before Hugo a khaki leather banner on
which many words concerning heroes and “worthy
son of a worthy mother’’ were inscribed. The startled
hero blushingly responded and concluded his few re-
marks to the Temperance ladies by adding: “But,
you know, I did enjoy the rum at Gallipoli!”
Mrs. John Mclnerny, a leading light of
the National Council of Women and other
well-advertised Melbourne societies, gave
Melbourne “benevolent” administration a
rotten testimonial at the recent annual
meeting of the original Ladies’ Benevolent
Society. Speaking of men with large fami-
lies, Mrs. Mclnerny said :
In some eases, such as those where the father bv
reason of delicate health or uncertain work earns
under £3 per week, help has to be given by the
benevolent society, and, this is invariably followed by
deterioration of tone.
Yet it should be possible for a benevolent
lady to visit the sick or feed the liungrv
without making the object of such au effort
feel like a mangy pup.
Paul Joseph, of the Tasmanian expecta-
tions and the South Australian disappoint-
ments, has done the “correct” thing. When
the smash came and he gave up being a par-
son he also ceased to be a chaplain. Now he
enlists as a Billjim; and the limelight, which
must have wondered where he had got to
lately, finds him in the centre of the stage
again. It all sets itself to melodrama head-
lines: Act I.—The World at his Feet. Act 2.
~At the Church Door. The Clouds Gather.
Act 3. —In the Ranks. A Soldier and a Man.
Acts 4 and 5. — (To be announced.)
Died at Melbourne, aged 43. Father
Shaw, of the wireless station at Randwick
(Sydney), purchased the other day by the
Navy Dept, for £55,000, after negotiations
that will have to be made public some
day. He had just completed the deal when
a brain stroke cut him off. Born at Wagea
(N.S.W.) in 1573, Shaw started in the
telegraph room at Sydney G.P.O. Next he
entered the Sacred Heart monastery at
Kensington, and after being ordained priest
was sent to New Guinea, where he had
charge of the business side of the missions
k turning to look after the same interests
at the Sydney end. About 10 years ago he
started experimenting in wireless, and from
ins station on the Randwick heights could
soon speak to Port Moresby. His record
was a chat from Randwick to the Marama
at Honolulu. Capital thought it saw a good
thing and the Randwick laboratory was
floated into a company, of which Father
Shaw and Rupert Clarke were chief sliare-
hclders. Mineralogy and oil painting were
sidelines of the versatile priest’s activities
FAIR WARNING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Miss does not seek to disguise her great
fondness for children. The love she has for little
ones simply bubbles out of her in that piquant scene
with the babies. —Melbourne paper.
Ycu’ve seen the dainty songstress when they march
the kiddies out,
Hew she hugs them and she loves them and she
paws the dears about;
llow she'll catch one up, and hold it close, and kiss
its tiny phiz
Just to show you what a kindly, tender-hearted thing
she is!
It was in the “Dancing Duchess,” and you should
remember well
Our little leading lady. She was called the Ruby
Belle.
She did a childish chorus all paternal hearts to
clutch,
And five-and-iwenty babies gave the right domestic
touch.
They marched, and chirped, and danced a bit. With
simulated bliss
And affected bursts of rapture, at the merest sight of
this,
The Belle would take a nipper to her heart, and
raise a cheer
By the pretty way she mothered and she mugged the
little dear.
In point of fact the Belle had got no sort of use for
kids ;
She would not have been a mother for a pyramid of
quids.
But ‘ the dunder-headed people thought she loved
them so much that
They took to leaving surreptitious babies on the mat.
They put babies on the gas-box, they put babies in
the bath.
Any morning you might see a swaddled infant on
the path.
And at length some institution every morning sent
a man
To collect the surplus babies and remove them in a
van.
The climax to a series of demoralising shocks
Was a gift across the footlights—someone’s baby in
a box.
Then the Belle tore up her contract, and in reason-
able rage
Took to and spanked with vigor every baby on the
stage.
That finished her for ever. In the game it’s under-
stood
She’s living in seclusion with a hopeless “sisterhood.”
Dear pro., love not too hungrily the babies in the
plot—
A kindly public may take steps to give you all it’s
got!

THE TIGER YAWNED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(Dedicated to the tiger owned by the illusionist mi
the Tivoli circuit .)
The twitter of the serio,
The patter of comedians low,
The fall of rubber acrobats,
The bashing in of ancient hats,
The whirlwind dance, the stunt refined —
All by this critic most unkind
Are killed stone-dead. No words, oh no !
He merely yawns through all the show.
Some soul in Hell long ages since—
Some fire-scarred Middle Ages prince—
Might yawn like this discerning beast
If for a while the torment ceased
And stokers flagged before the dawn.
Had I that splendid fang-lined yawn
I’d soon reform the foolish stage!
These fleabites of the printed page
Accomplish nothing. “Turns” still go'
Though critics snarl in ev’ry row.
Fat actors spout, press-agents b10w....
Off with the dance 1 The lights turn low!
Bring tigers in at ev’ry show!

Archbisli Wright, of Sydney, was the
other day un before the N.S.iV. ('commission
which is inquiring into venereal diseases, and
the gaiters weren’t at all comfortable. They
didn't want tin* parson to have anything to
do with the unpleasant nuisance. The parson’s
.job, in short, was to marry people when they
wanted to be married: —not to Stop them from
being married merely because the parson
knew one of them was a mass of corruption
who would soon corrupt the other and pass
the curse in any of a hundred forms on to
succeeding generations. Ilis Grace might
have felt better —or, again, he mightn’t—if
lie had happened to see a recent judgment of
the English .lodge Darling’s before he went
forth to give the clergy this newest and most
wretched advt. The case was whether a
lodging-house keeper could recover from a
leper because he had come to his house and
THE SENTIMENTAL KID.
“I’m always linking of you, Daddy! Look! Quick! I’m doing it now!”
lived in it without disclosing liis disease.
“There is no legal obligation on., a leper to
give himself away,” said his Honor; “but, ot
course, a gentleman would have made the
disclosure.”
Hammer your old mother if you.like; but
as you value your liberty don’t sell a bottle
of beer after hours! For the former pleas-
antly, done with a poker, the old nuisance
being aged SI, a Victorian gentleman has
just been fined £lO or two months; while a
woman who had improperly traded in beer
was lined £lO or three months. \ ietorian
Justice, of the honorary variety, is not so
much blind as daft.
“George’s Head”: They can’t do enough
for the Anzac in England. A lieutenant of
Gallipoli found his way into a small private
hospital for officers maintained by the Ameri-
can wife of an English baronet. He was the
only Australian on the premises, and when
January -0 came round he formally asked
permission to get in few bottles to drink
Australia’s health at dinner. The hostess
asked what the occasion was, and the soldier
from the South told her it was Australia’s
Fourth of July. Permission was formally
given and nothing more was said at the time.
But when dinner-time, approached, the butler
waited on the Australian and asked if he
would mind if the hostess took over the
little celebration. Of course he wouldn’t
mind. Shortly afterwards, when the guest-
patients were ushered into the dining-hall,
they found it hung with Australian flags:
and when they were seated they were handed
a wine-list with the best vintages of Aus-
tralia on it, and the Australian was begged
to excuse the absence fiom the menu of kan-
garoo-tail soup. The generous hostess had
even tried to get that for him out of.the end-
less pockets of wonderful old London!
It has just been decided by the S. Aus.
Supreme Court that an ex-husband has not
any of the rights of a “husband” within the
meaning of the Act. The right this one
wanted was to extract damages from the re-
cent co-re. Asked why he had not claimed
them when getting the divorce, he could only
say that the other way seemed cheaper at the
time. The Court told him that he had gone
outside and shut the door, so to speak, and it
could not now be re-opened.
Here, is Young Australia’s published
record for one week (State of N.S.W.) : -V
Manly 12-year-okl girl completed a happy
month in a cave in the suburban bush: an
eight-year-old Northern Rivers boy saved his
sister from drowning; a. 13-year-old bov
burgled a house at liandwick ; a 10-year-old
boy, accused of horse-stealing, was taken
back from Sydney, and escaped from the
lock-up at Blayney; a family of Sydney
children (eldest 11) nursed their sick
mother and looked after the house, shop and
baby; a 14-year-old boy borrowed a horse
and trap and set off to see the world ; and
a seven-year-old rode 13 miles to find a
doctor for his sick father. There’s another
lot of Anzacs coming.
SO SUCH LUCK.
THE Z[?]: “The tempter's lurking behind those doors, watching and wailing to hire
you in.”
THE M[?]THROPE: “Yer can’t hid me with that yarn, mister! I been ’angin'
round ’ere all mornin', an’ I ain’t been ashed in yet!”
This jaded continent has just missed wit-
nessing a willing scrap between two bishops.
When the Cold Tea referendum was looming
at Kalgoorlie (W.A.), Dr. Golding Bird,
who wears the Anglican gaiters there,
preached a sermon, in which he expressed
the view that early-closing would not of
itself produce temperance. Bung joyfully
grabbed at the straws of comfort which could
be gleaned from a telegraphed report of the
sermon, and reprinted passages, scattering
them broadcast. The C. of E. Messenger,
‘•the official organ of the cuocese of Mel-
bourne,” thereupon lectured Bird on ”1118
ineffably silly utterance,” and proclaimed it
the duty of all good Anglicans “to tell every-
body that most of us are heartily ashamed
of his notorious utterance; that we are
aware that his illustrations are “childish,”
etc. Finally, the Messenger piously invited
“earnest prayers that he may be brought to
a healthier state of soitl.” Bird, of course,
claims that the reports" of his sermon were
inaccurate; and when his Synod the other
day condoled with him on “the unjustifiable
attack, based on misleading reports of a ser-
mon which he had never preached,” he
told them his first inclination had been to
resign his see and issue writs for libel
against all concerned, beginning with the
Archbishop of Melbourne. Even the lay
public, who like a bit of excitement now and
then, will be sorry he changed his mind.
It reminds The Bulletin of a small,
friendly correspondence it once had with the
Bishop—he was a Dean then at Newcastle.
Four years ago Norman Lindsay had made a
splendid job of The Bulletin’s idea of a
Christmas sermon —the nations of the world
armed and arming (Germany was shown
with a smoking bomb in its hands) hypo-
critically singing “Peace on Earth, Goodwill
to Men” with the Devil as conductor; and
thev all had their backs turned on the Cross.
In the light of subsequent events The
Bulletin doesn’t mind admitting that it
was a great cartoon, and the best Christmas
sermon preached that year. But Golding
Bird attacked it viciously in a Cathedra! ser-
mon. This paper dropped the Dean a mild
protest. He replied with a lordly letter
which concluded triumphantly, “You may
publish this.” Then The Bulletin wrote
in pain to Dr. Biid. It pointed out the
obvious meaning of the picture. He shuffled;
but The Bulletin was enjoying the hunt.
Then he flew definitely to another twig. It
wasn’t that picture alone that was in his
mind, he said ; it was other things, and hi
view of the other things lie hadn’t
any idea that The Bulletin meant
what he. could now see that the
picture might mean. Whereupon the
budding Bishop was written to much as the
Messenger wrote of him recently. The
Bulletin didn’t exactly promise to pray for
him, but it ventured to hope that he would
leave off being such a smug Pharisee, and
trusted that generally the experience would
be a serious lesson to him. As an after-
thought a I’.S. was added : "You may
publish this.” Naturally he never did.
“Mother of One”: What am I going to
do about it now when the christening’s over
and we’ve got into the way of calling the
little pet “Anzey”? Why didn’t the blessed
Ocvernment speak up before? It was over
the odds dubbing every new Mary Ann villa
and baking powder “Anzac.” But what is
going to happen to my son Anzac Pozieres?
Is lie to be fined every time he appears in
public, or am I to have him unbranded? If
I drop his first lovely name and keep the
other his schoolmates will nickname him
“Poison.” I tell you what, I wish the old
war had never started !

An ingenious young woman made a bid
for sympathy by bringing a baby into court
in Sydney the other day, and only just
missed scoring. She had answered her bail
on a charge of stealing, and her solicitor
painted a pathetic word-picture of her ter-
rible circumstances. But apparently the
police smelt something, so they induced the
magistrate to adjourn the case for a time,
and, later, a 'John Hop steered into court a
very indignant woman who claimed the baby
as hers. She explained that the other per-
son, who lodged at the same house, had
offered to take the child for an airing, and,
being busy, she had gladly consented. The
Court then dried its eyes, and proceeded to
make unpleasant remarks to the lady who
had touched its heart.
THE LOST LEGION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A cable states that the English Church Times
deplores the bad language used by soldiers, and “A
Mother” writes to the press that she 'will not allow
her son to enlist until the evil is abated. “Cannot
something be done?” she inquires pathetically.
Have you heard of our famous battalion,
The members of which all agree
To cut out the blank and the adverb
And never to use a Big D ?
Xo term that is stronger than “Dash it!”
Our sergeant has ever employed ;
But the Colonel was heard to say “Bother!”
One day when extremely annoyed.
Xo matter how great is the anger
Our fellows may feel for the foe,
If they should say “Curse ’em!” or “Hang ’em!”
They’d feel that they’d fallen so low.
Our non-coms are Chesterfields always—
Though 1 once heard a corporal say
“Oh, blow!” though I’ll owfi that his language
Was used in a gentleman’s way.
You ask for our name and our number,
And what are our colors and crest,
And who in the h—l is our colonel?
I can but reply: “(Yell, I’m blessed
1 f I know; for the fact of the matter’s
(Just strictly between you and me)
We’re the legion that never was listed —
And are not d —d well likely to be !

By sinking the Ilaupiri, at the mature age
of 31, the Germans have got one back. For-
merly the Island trader Richmond, she was
seized 28 years ago by the German Gov-
ernor in Samoa for some breach of the trad-
ing regulations, and was only released after
a wrangle between the British and German
Governments. Now the Gerhogs have got
her. On the other hand, they have lost
Samoa.
“F.L.J.’s” hints on what to do when you
get a coadjutor:—
Archbishop Mannix, coadjutor of Archbishop Carr,
of Melbourne, has been saying some scorching things
that must make his chief on the Eastern Hill grieve.
The two men don't live in the same house. They are
divided as the east is from the west. When Dr.
Mandhx was taken from Maynooth College to be Dr.
Carr’s coadjutor or successor, he was given a house
and church in West Melbourne to live in and take
charge of. He was put as far off as he could be ; and
so their trend is apart instead of together. The late
Dr. Ooold, Bishop or Archbishop of Melbourne
for the best part of half a century, was wiser;
he never asked help from Rome. He didn’t like
coadjutors. His staunch old chum, Father John
Fitz Patrick, who acted all the time as his Vicar-
General, was sufficient. The trouble of it is that if
a man has a coadjutor he can’t talk to him as he
might to an office-boy. If they are to pull on the
one rope it can only be done, not by the giving of
orders, but by suggestion. Dr. Carr ought to have
kept his assistant under the same roof with him at
East Melbourne. But he didn’t —-and that’s where he
blundered.

At Perth on August 4 a property-holder
was charged with not having registered his
orchard. It appeared that, besides grape-
vines, he owned a tree the like of which Eve
used to pluck her millinery from. Under
the Westralian law he was entitled to own
anything up to 25 grape-vines without paying
the orchard registration fee (2s. Gd.), pro-
vided he didn’t go in for other sorts of fruit.
Because of the figtree he was haled to court.
In court he produced the tree. It was barely

looks.”
2ft. high, and was growing in half a kero-
sene-tin ! “And that, your Worship,” he
explained with a guilty look, “is what I am
summoned for keeping.” The beak said it
was hard, but the fine and costs would
amount to 10s. Whereupon the Law con-
sumed another carrot and proceeded to deal
with the next case.
THE JOYS THAT FADE.
THE OPTIMIST: “Well, they say the war will be over by Christmas.”
THE PESSIMIST: “Yes, I dare say. Me drawing thirty bob a week’without working. I

At Burnley, two miles from the G.P.0.,
where the Vic. State Government has been
running a horticultural school for many
years and wondering all the time how to
make the white-elephant worth while, there
are now 35 girl-gar-
deners. They wear a
sort of uniform, with
horse-hide gloves and
cowhide puttees, and
if the thing were a
game instead of a busi-
ness it would be a
howling success. As
it is, during the past
seven years the annual
average of students
completing the full
course at the school
has been two, so it
hardly seems surpris-
ing that Spuds-Minis-
ter Hagelthorn has
been at his wits’ end
to know how to use
the property to advan-
tage. Still, now that
the Melbourne Univer-
sity has actually de-
cided to make agricul-
ture one of the sub-
jects for its matricula-
tion examination, the
future looks leg?
gloomy. The harried
Hagelthorn has de-
cided that not only
daisy-raising and cat-
nipping shall betaught
at the sc h o 01, but
ploughing and turnin-
ing as well; and with
this decision there may
possibly dawn a new
agricultural day for
Victoria —that is, if
only the matriculated
ploughboy can get hold
of a bit of land on
whi e h to whet bis
plcugli-knowledge. It takes some doing in
Victoria.

“J.F.IL”: Arrived in London from Pit-
cairn Island, a lonely spot in Australian
waters, Emily McCoy, whose father is said
to be the “ruler” of this Pacific isle of
romance where the mutineers of the Bounty
found a refuge. According to Miss Emily,
Pitcairn is run on patriarchal lines. Pa
settles all disputes amicably, so there is no
necessity for courts or punishments. People
take from each other what they want and
restore it when they no longer need it. Locks
and keys are unknown, and Miss Emily
wonders why so-called civilised countries
like England and America should continue
to cherish these relics of a barbaric age.
There is always an abundance of food in
Pitcairn. Goats and chickens run wild;
fruits and vegetables grow everywhere.
Emily blushed when she saw the bathing
costumes and ballroom dresses of New York;
such abominations would not be tolerated in
decorous and respectable Pitcairn, where
“modesty is innate, and women wear loose
gowns from the shoulders to the feet, and
no case of violation of marriage is ever
known.” But what, then, do they talk about
in lonely Pitcairn?
* * * *
“Kettledrum”: The epigram of the Rev.
Benjamin Ilewison, of Northc-ote (Vic.),
that raffling is gambling in knickerbockers,
makes me bold to say what I have long
thought that nine o’clock pub. closing is
dipsomania in a pinafore.
“T.W.”: Private Enterprise
does some things better. Both
the London County Council
and that mammoth monopoly
the London General Omnibus
Co. have taken on the “con-
ductorette” to replace men
during the war—and a little
after if it can be managed.
But, gentlemen, consider the
difference! The L.G.0.C.,
being a naughty Private En-
terprise, has called in the fem-
inine diminutive, mostly fair-
tressed, pretty, plump and
dimpled, just the kind of girl
the late George Edwardes
used to select for his Gaiety
chorus. Also, they are sliort-
frocked and gaitered to the
knees, so it is real good to sit
in the nearside corner of the
omnibus when they mount the
steps to collect fares. The
L.C.C. young woman, off the
other ’bus, is generally hefty,
severe and frequently spec-
tacled, and her dress reaches
right down to her ankles. But
the young men passengers
wouldn’t be bothered even if
this lot wore trains and masks.
It was bound to come, of course, but that
doesn’t make it any more desirable. Port
Melbourne is to have a “king” compe-
tition. That there is- nothing intention-
ally comic about the affair is shown by the
fact that one Port Melbournian has already
been nominated as “king of the A.N.A.” and
another as “king of sport”—a silly business
deserving severe discouragement. Some day,
with all this “king” and “queen” foolish-
ness, somebody will be starting a revolu-
tion ; and in that day the chosen one will
be anointed with the squashed tomato of
derision and the mellow egg of ancient lin-
eage, and the penny-elect will be obliged to
get down from his seat on the lorry and
tear for cover. 'The Port, come to think of
it, would be just the likely place for such
things.

Agar Wynne’s pet scheme for the direct
supply of produce by post is to be knocked
on the head. Under the late P.M.G.’s system
any city person wanting lcwt. of turnips or
a side of pork simply sent an order to one of
•the rural-producers advertising such items,
and the goods were presently delivered per
rail and postal-van direct. It was a good
scheme as far as it went: for instance, with-
out a doubt it greatly assisted the Victoria
apple-grower to dispose of his crop at pro-
fitable rates last season. But the rural pro-
ducer didn’t treat it well; he had a lament-
able habit of regarding the consumer as a
sucker prepared to pay top prices for bottom
stuff. Also, the public didn't seem to be
generally aware that the system had sur-
vived Wynne’s retirement. A flamboyant
poster, persistently displayed in all post
offices and railway stations, would probably
have made a vast difference in the revenue
from the service; but Wynne’s successors
apparently just let the scheme stagger along
to its doom.
“Bows,” from the bridge:—
I’ve just had a look at the Commonwealth Light-
house service on the Inner Route to Torres
Strait. Unwatclied lights are taking the place of
the old-fashioned lightship which was always a more
or less unreliable guide. For instance, the Piper
Island ark escaped only the other day, and had to
be collared by the John Douglas and taken back
and re-moored. The unwatched lights have proved
so far a great success. There are three in use at
present, viz., Clark Island, Dim Reef and Pipon
Island, and the construction gang is working at
one on Farmer Island to replace the wandering Piper
Island ship. These lights run for a year with one
charge. On arriving to recharge those at Dim
Reef and Pipon Island after their first 12 months’
work, we found them quite as brilliant as when
they were first lit.
The most notable feature of these signals is the
mechanical method of lighting and extinguishing by
sensitive electrical apparatus controlled by the sun’s
light but not by its heat. “When the sun rises to
a height of five degrees above the horizon the. appar-
atus automatically extinguishes itself, leaving only
a small pilot burning; and when the same altitude
is reached p.m., the light automatically gets to work
again, thus enabling the descending sun to have a
good look at it before retiring. I often wonder
what the abos. of Cape Melville think of the new
untended lamp. The old one had three white fellers
to look after it, and these white fellers or their
white gins were often good for a loaf of bread or an
old coat, accepting fish or perhaps thanks in return.
Now there’s nobody to ask “You gibbit tucker?”
Construction work was always difficult and some-
times dangerous at Dhu Reef, the amount of dry
island available being so small that the men had to
keep their feet well tucked up in the blankets to
prevent prowling' sharks from nibbling at their toes
during sleep-time. But the work goes cheerily on.
and maybe in a couple of years’ time Torres Strait
pilots may be wondering why the deuce Australia
spent so much money on marine lamp-posts anil did
good men out of their jobs.

With filmy fingers our ideal swain;

The still skies dimple into stars again;

Dead at 86, Maurice O’Rorke, knight, of
Maoriland. He was eight times Speaker of
the House of Reps., first in ’79 and in every
succeeding Parliament but one until 1902.
O’Rorke invested his job with a stupendous
dignity and ruled the House with a rod of
iron and a rich, fruity brogue. When he
said “Silence” there was the peace of the
tomb. When he remarked, “Sit down,
sir,” the gentleman sat. In the days when
the world was wide ’tis a gay spark was
Maurice, but he always carried it like a
gentleman should. Of late years he in-
habited the Leg. Council and spent most of
his time struggling to get a Bill passed
authorising the University to grant degrees
in divinity. He was a fine old man, with
quaint whiskers, an honorable record of use-
fulness as a citizen and Parliamentarian and
—poor. His only son, Teddy, had an Irish-
man’s mania for hunting, but married cash,
and is now somewhere buying horses for the
War Office.
One of the oldest of Maorilanders died
last week —William Leonard Williams. He
was born in 1829 at Paihia, in the Bay of
Islands, the son of one of the first mission-
aries. His father early migrated down
the West Coast to Ilawkes Bay, became
Bishop of Waiapu and there founded the
fortunes of a clan that waxed exceeding rich.
In course of time, when Stuart shed his
gaiters at Napier and fled to Persia as a
missionary, William Leonard was made a
bishop too, mainly because his name was
Williams and his purse was deep. Henare
has a legend about the Williams who first
arrived thereabouts: “He tell us ‘look up te
sky.’ We look—and py golly when we look
down again him te fellar got all te land.”
\\ illiam retired from bishing a few years
ago owing to age and was succeeded by
Averill, who now bishes on anti-wowser
principles at Auckland. He was tall and
very thin, decorated with a long white beard
like the foliage of a prophet from the Land
of Canaan.
’Way back in ’6O an Irish youth landed in
Melbourne with 2d. Looking for more, he
wandered over to Maoriland and kept hard
at it until he died last week at Wellington.
He was Martin Kennedy, one-time M.P.,
merchant, colliery proprietor, landowner and
director of the Bank of New Zealand. In
the long ago he owned the Brunner Mine,
which subsequently blew up and wiped out
the whole working shift. It was after merging
the property into the Grey Valley Coal Co.
that he left Westland and settled in Welling-
ton to run a coal business. By accident he'
at this stage tumbled into Staples’s brewery.
That was a gold-mine, and it was as a poten-
tate in the Beer industry that Martin was
best known in later years. He was a hard
nail wid a wall eye. Once he explained to
the writer how this eye helped him to early
success in business. “When I started store-
keeping in Greymouth,” he said. “I knew
nothing about it, but reckoned that as I only
had one good eye it would be just as well to
have only one door on the premises. Then I
could see what went out as well as what
came in.” The habit stuck. The joyless old
money-spinner was 76 when he banked the
last dollar.

THE STUDENT.
A familiar figure in Collins Street.
In a recent Argus Professor Tucker
deals with the literary aspect of Hughes’s
speeches. In William, it seems, we have
another Demosthenes. He possesses the
power of producing “apt and illuminating
metaphors at will.” Tucker is prepared to
take a passage from the Adelaide speech,
translate it into Greek, and pass it off as
pure Demosthenes. This doesn’t so much
impress The Bulletin with the importance
of Hughes as with the unimportance of
Tucker. Hughes has been in public life
here for 20 years; but the Tuckers of Aus-
tralia didn’t have the acumen to discern his
qualities till he went to England and got
hallmarked there. Or if they had the acu-
men to discern they lacked the pluck to tell
the truth about a Labor person.
AMY CASTLES.
The Vic. Parliament has 99 members, and
thus far it has sent three of them to war
service abroad. They are Matthew Baird
and Kennedy Smith, M’s.L.A., and Richard
Rees, M.L.C. Of the trio Rees has just left
unofficially for Paris, Lieut. Smith is doing
hospital work in the English provinces, and
Major Baird is back from the Front in-
valided and unable to take his seat in Par-
liament. The rest of the House spends
much of its time sitting comfortably back
and amiably considering the desirability of
employing Huns in the Railways and the
propriety of allowing German to remain the
chief tongue in certain Victorian schools.
“T. 0.1.”: Re the Maoriland widow who
became a nun and has a daughter who is a
nun, too. The widow of Frederick A. Weld,
one time Governor of W.A. and Tasmania,
has a unique record. Filomena Mary Anne,
eldest daughter of Ambrose Lisle March
Phillips de Lisle, of Leicester, she married
Sir F. A. Weld in 1858. On his death in
1891 the widow became a nun. Two of her
daughters are nuns and two of her sons
priests. One daughter became Rev. Mother
in the convent where her mother was a nun.
The Welds are intermarried with the Clif-
fords of Chudleigh and the famous Vaughans.
Trooper F. Montague Battye, wounded in
France, is grandson of an old-time soldier in
N. S, Wales—Captain Battye, of the Royal
Welsh Fusiliers, who as a youngster was
page to Queen Adelaide on her marriage
with the Duke of Clarence, afterwards Wil-
liam IV. Retiring from the army, Captain
Battye became superintendent of police, and
sei’ved at Bathurst, Alburv and other centres.
Sergeant Hugh Brennan, of the A.1.F., who
can wear both a D.C.M. and a V.C., very
nearly missed the Gallipoli turmoil where he
collected those distinctions. He broke an
arm and a leg by accident while in camp,
and was discharged from the forces and sent
to hospital; but when they had patched him
up after three months in bed he enlisted
again, and made up for lost time by showing
Abdul a few. points about bomb-throwing.
On one occasion he hurled bombs all night
and most of the next day without a stop. He
left the Anzac trenches in a stretcher, and
being judged unfit for further service was
sent home. (Thank God, one result of the
war will be that for Billjim in future “home”
will mean Australia, and not some unknown
place across the world!) Now Brennan
reckons he is fit again, and is in camp at
Liverpool (N.S.W.), getting ready for
another round in the big scrap.
Died in Adelaide, Henry Hains, who was
the. secretary to the S. Australian committee
which carried through a bigger and more
pregnant thing than Eureka Stockade—the
Maritime Strike of 1890. Practically all the
men who are now in the front rank of the
Australian Labor movement were unearthed
in that stirring period ; and that was when
the Parliamentary Labor party was hatched.
Henry Hains stood back, however; but his
colleague Guthrie was sent to the Leg. Coun-
cil the next year, and has been either there
or in the Senate ever since.
There is no danger of the Parsell family
becoming extinct. Mrs. J. Parsell, who died
the other day at Yarrawonga (Vic.), aged
85, left behind 90 grandchildren, 10 apiece
for her nine children.
“Eddyson’s” send off :
Poor Frank Mahony! For dainty work his illus-
trations to Banjo’s “Geebung Polo Club” have never
been beaten by any horse artist on earth. What
Banjo, Gordon and Ogilvie did for the Australian
neddy in rhyme . Frank P. Mahony did for him in
pure line. Mahony, as The Bulletin says, should
never have left Australia. His stuff was so intensely
Australian that it appealed only to Australians.
But he had a naive idea that he was going to hit
the centre of Empire a resounding blow. As a
matter of fact he dropped into London with the
plunk of a stone heaved into unlimited mud.
Apropos, there is a story. Tom Durkin, another
Bulletin black-and-white, had explained his inten-
tion of going to London. Mahony was hurt. This
thing was being overdone. “Oh, no Durkin,” he
said, “don’t you go to London —I’m going to Lon-
don.”
Killed in France, Sergeant Reg. Read,
till lately teacher of Sloyd work at the
Stawell High School. He had some bright
ideas. A fortnight after his death The
Bulletin received an Egyptian pencil-
sketch of his—“ Portrait of a Soldier who
has just been asked by the Colonel why he
doesn’t Sing on the March.” With a blazing
sun over his head, a load for a camel on
his back and burning sand under his feet,
the soldier seems to be suggesting that even
a colonel might reasonably be expected to
know that much without asking a private
for the information.
From an old hand at the table :
The Vic. Labor movement lacks good platform
men. Ex-leader Prendergast, who frequently rouses
an audience to enthusiasm in the early stages of a
speech, gets his effects by bellowing, turning very red
with the effort thereof, and rushing two steps to the
right, two to the left and back to his original posi-
tion. But he has a fatal habit, after the first
few “rounds,” of producing a paper and reading a
long quotation of small interest. The stirring effect
of his previous ebullitions goes for nothing after a
few yards of this, and the audience begins groping
for its hat. Elmslie has a good flow of conventional
language, but is a stolid speaker and uses only the
most highly respectable phrases. Still, this suits
Victoria very well. Lemmon, secretary to the Oppo-
sition, has a scholarly style and can talk till the
cows come home; but he fails to stir the pulse.
Solly, Hannah and Cotter are all old “reliables” and
will never start a revolution. Tunnecliffe is the
most seriously Socialistic speaker of the party,
Blackburn not excluded; the latter, though a prac-
tised spouter, has nothing in his vocabulary or his
manner to lift him out of the ruck of gap-fillers.
Probably Jewell, of Brunswick, is the worst per-
former of the lot; but he deserves a crown of
laurels for generally refraining from debate.
NAVAL MANOEUVRES.
Naval Minister Jens Jensen—a caricature in
clay, modelled by Kitty Boyes.
John Bocley, who had a funeral last week,
was Victoria’s 483rd tor so) alleged cen-
tenarian. He had long lived near Camper-
down, was the father of eight sons (one of
them George, formerly M.L.A. in S.A.), and
his reputed tally was 106.
Actor Leslie Gaze, whose public appear-
ances are nowadays mostly limited to
patriotic and charitable events, is to be the
chief performer at the annual Adam land-
say Gordon “pilgrimage” next Sunday. Gaze
will recite some of Gordon’s verses and help
to instigate a vigorous collection for the
Red Cross. This year, by the way, the
“pilgrims” who hoof it to the Brighton
cemetery are to be confined to the gum
plantation outside the main enclosure. They
will thus be restrained from “remembering”
the poet by stripping his grave-garden of
its verdure, leaf by leaf.

This is the bank in which the “Money”
Miller influence is strong; and wherever the
Miller influence is strong —as in the “Vic-
toria” group of insurance cos. —the settled
policy seems to be to pay out an uncom-
monly large proportion of the profits. In
these days, at any rate, they are entitled to
say in defence that, when there is a very
large reserve fund, the rate of dividend is
liable to give the public an entirely wrong
idea. Big dividends are resented. Indeed,
they invite attack. Yet the co. which is
paying 20 p.c.—the West Australian Bank,
for instance —may be actually giving a
smaller return on the shareholders’ funds
than one which is paying only 7 p.c.
Whatever the grounds, the policy of this
bank appears to be to avoid large reserves,
or, at any rate, to only build them up
slowly. If the business presently requires
more money it presumably will be got from
the shareholders and added to capital
account in the ordinary way. At present,
however, it is not wanted, because the bank
has a big capital compared with its liabili-
ties. Take first these figures:—
Liabilities.
June,’ls. June,’l6. Decrease.
Notes in circulation. . £7,939 £7,426 £513
Bills, etc 528,126 473,328 54,798
Deposits at interest. . 4,269,068 4,161,165 107,903

Advances . . . . 6,502,821 6,476,664 26,157
Premises, etc. . . 350,326 337,290 13,036
The bank thus owes £6,976,789; and on
June 30 it had £1,953,062 of its own. Thus
for every £1 of its own in the business there
is under £3 12s. of the public’s; and in
many a very sound bank each £1 of the
shareholders’ has to guarantee £8 of the
public’s. The public’s money in the “Vic”
is thus well protected and the shareholders’
money has to carry comparatively little
risk. Other things have to be considered,
of course. For instance, the quality of the
security against which the bank has made
advances. There is really no way of testing
this. A balance-sheet doesn’t tell —can’t
tell. All it says is that, in this case, the
advances are unusually heavy in proportion
to total funds. Mostly in these times an
Australian bank holds anything from 40 to
55 p.c. of its liabilities liquid—in forms,
that is, which are not very liable to depre-
ciation. But the Victoria’s liquid assets
represent only 30 p.c. of its liabilities.
Judging by ordinary standards this means,
among other things, that the bank is
trading to the limit of its present resources.
But possibly this bank is not to be judged
by ordinary standards; for when it wants
more money it ought to be able to get it
with much greater ease than most of them.

That noise you heard just now was a song
of thanksgiving. It wasn’t for nothing that
chairman E. C. Dyason was born into a
musical family. Things certainly have gone
the right way for this co. They were shap-
ing very well even before the war; since
then there has been no holding the profits
back. Look at the growth of the gross
trading profit:—l9ll, £22,459 ; 1912,
£31,428; 1913, £44.569; 1915 (14 months),
£84,012; 1916, £126,011. The War-time
Profits man is going to have some difficulty
when he tackles those figures. All that can
be said for certain, without further inquiry,
is that the war has made a lot of difference
to every Australian manufacturer of rubber
goods, because (1) it has shut out “Con-
tinental” and other enemy tyres, etc.; (2)
it has caused such a demand for tyres, etc.,
in the war zone that British and Allied goods
have not been available for export. But
what things are going to be like presently
this paper doesn’t know, because it doesn’t
know what the politician is going to do.
The anti-German yell is strong enough; but
you can’t make an Australian industry
merely by shutting out the products of a
German industry. In the last full year
preceding the war Australia imported
£1,021,584 worth of rubber, and of that lot
only £261,212 came from Germany and
Austria. Protection against enemy goods
will not therefore be anything like adequate.
But we still have a fight ahead of us to
make sure of getting much more than that.
And until we are sure of protection against
everyho&y, the size of this co.’s future is
uncertain.
Besides making such a rattling pr.ofit for
the past year the co. has done soraetinng
generous in the way of providing for wear
and tear. Besides writing £9349, or about
20 p.c., off nlant and rolling stock the co.
has struck £3226 off freeholds out of the
year’s earnings ; and provision has also been
made for Federal and State income taxes.
The highly profitable nature of the year’s
operations has also enabled the co. to extend
its business without any financing to speak
of. Here is a comparison:—

From that, again, must be deducted what-

against wear and tear. But wnen all that
has been done, enough will still be left to
warrant that Hallelujah Chorus with the
mention of which these few remarks opened.

In 1901, on G. S. Melrose ceasing to be a
director, A. J. Murray was appointed; and
right on to a year or two ago there was the
same Board of very wise old birds —Peter
Waite, James Harvey, A. J. Murray and
A G. Downer. In 1914 “A.G.” retired
after 22 years’ service; and to-day there
are three new men of a younger generation
at the table. But maybe it won’t make any
difference. The old men were very wise; the
new may have modern business virtues to
make them equally valuable. They have a
fine staff to work with, at any rate. It is a
great thing to have a mana such as Elder
Smith’s in S. Aus. Not only does business
flow naturally to such a concern; but the
young man who is worth having isn’t to be
seduced to another job as soon as he has
proved himself.
When the Governments passed over the
handling of the season’s wheat to three or
four firms Elder Smith’s was one of them
almost as a matter of course. But, as you
might expect, there is no money in it. “The
receipts from this source in London and
Australia to June 30 amount to £6550,
which will barely cover the expenses neces-
sarily incurred.” Still, perhaps these aaents
won’t put up so hard a fight to get rid of
their agencies as you might think. The
profits for the year are alleged to be actu-
ally due to commissions on * higher prices
realised for wool and live stock; and “there
has also been a considerable expans’on in
our metal business.” The directors having
made these admissions, the Bulletin
scents an interesting argument presently
with the Commonwealth Treasurer. So far,
apparently, no provision has been made for
anything in the way of war taxation of
profits; indeed, land and income taxes
charged to Profit and Loss were actually
less than for the preceding year.
The co., besides carrying on an extensive
agency business, has a large amount risked
in pastoral and other advances; and the
bulk of this is borrowed money. Here are
the figures:—
1901. 1911. 1915. 1916.
Deposits, etc. 554,426 1,715,863 1,636,756 1,779,287
Other liabilities 97,320 280,959 55,997 123,733
Premises, plant 54,136 133,024 139,984 137,105

Other assets. . 177,626 304,466 22,821 46,664
The co.’s creditors wiil not, however, worry
much. With its liquid assets the co. could
pay all but £997.000 of its debts; and to
pay that £997,000 it has £1,713.000 of
assets. Probably some of these assets may
be overvalued; on the other hand, many
have certainly been written down well below
their market value. And it doesn’t look as
though there will be much of a slump in
pastoral securities, at any rate. If anything
in the future looks certain it is that live
stock will continue very dear, and probably
wool also, and that will keep up the market
value of squattages. Which will be good,
not only for this co.’s securities, but for its
commission earnings as well.

Capital previously was £82,804, so the pre-
sent 7 p.c. is as good as 10i p.c. would have
been hitherto. And p.c. isn’t any too
much, in view of the long run of nils in the
’9o’s. Australian policy hitherto seems to
have been specially designed to suit the
gambler instead of the steady industrial
plodder—to suit the speculator instead of
the investor. In the first place we are
always tinkering with the tariff, chiefly
because we are afraid out of our lives to
put on 10 p.c. lest 94 p.c, should be enough.
The Freetrader has been far too sensible to
demand Freetrade. Freetrade would compel
him to put unpopular duties on tea and
other things we can’t produce here. So the
Billy Hugheses and other Freetraders have
as a rule conceded just enough Protection
to be ineffective; and the average Protec-
tionist hasn’t had the pluck to talk 50 or
60 p.c. He has been pleased to be “mod-
erate.” The consequent tariff tinkering has
been largely responsible for the in-and-out
running of such cos. as this. But the
tendency of Australia to go on borrowing
jags has been an even more powerful factor.
A small population which borrows 98 mil-
lions in one decade and 48 in the next, 19
millions in one five-year period and 87 in
the next, can’t expect its industrial pond to
be placid. And this more than anything
else is responsible for strikes and industrial
unrest.
In the natural order of things Walkers
would be in for a dull time, following the
boom of five years past. But, while it
cannot possibly escape the swing-back of the
pendulum, it will no doubt be a very sub-
stantial gainer by the healthier feeling with
regard to Australian industry. This paper
is suffering from no illusions on the subject
of enemy goods. It knows that very soon
after the end of the war travellers will be
offering things as German because they
will know that people will expect to get
German things cheap. But simply because
people will make a public profession of
their practical patriotism it will be easier
to get a decent tariff through, and that tariff,
because it will help to start new industries
and expand old ones, will srive this old-
established engineering co. a lift.
And Walkers will be found ready for any
ordinary emergency. It has divided profits
sparingly during the boom years and is now
in an exceedingly strong position. Look at
these figures:—•

But in a case of this sort it isn’t of much
practical value to consider what assets there
are. Here, nominally, there is £26,120 show-
ing in excess of the capital. Everybody
knows, however, that if for any reason the
undertaking showed no profit, the bulk of the
assets—largely hydraulic mains and installa-
tions—wouldn’t be worth ss. in the £ of their
book value. Hence the need to keep the eye
giued on the profits. And the true profits
of a concern of this kind are not very easily
ascertained either. For instance, apparently
there was in the past five years only £5200
of undivided profit to add to reserves as com-
pared with £11,580 in the previous five years.
But actually in the past five years over £BOOO
has been spent in renewing boilers, valves, etc.,
and those things were depreciating as much
in the earlier five as in the later five years.
What depreciation there was in days gone
by it is impossible to say. The Bulletin
more than once remarked that it was very
doubtful whether the 10 p.c. dividend was
always actually earned —in other words,
whether the amount in excess of the dividend
was a sufficient provision towards a special
renewals fund. It also remembers, by the
way, that on one occasion one or two direc-
tors were stupid enough to talk of this as a
libei. In addition, of course, to the special
renewals, there is ordinary maintenance,
which is being paid for out of current
revenue as hitherto.
But while the past was made to look better
than it actually was -a-nd the present is in a
measure payrng for it, it would certainly be
absurd to say that things have really im-
proved. In the last year or so the co. has
gone in for lift-repair work. Deducting the
amount spent in wages and materials in that
branch, the gross revenue for the first half of
each of the last eight years has been as
follows: —-
1909 ..£12.294
1910 .. 11,436
1911 . . 11,260
1912 .. 11,270
1913 . . £12,409
1914 , . 11,521
1915 , . 11,442
1910 . . i 0,940
That is not good enough, considering the con-
struction boom that Sydney has had. Keen
electrical competition has been one bug-
bear. Perhaps there have been others. Thus
it is doubtful whether the directors really
recognised the sort of fight they had oil.
But a new Hoard is now in command; and
there is certainly more punch in it.

Just as there are mines that are mines and mines
that are “duffers” so does one of the principal of
mine equipments; i.e., belting, vary greatly accord-
ing to the maker. As the Goodyear Tyre and Rubber
Co. make, among many other things, belting that
satisfies the most exacting requirements of mining
operations from Alaska to the Panama Canal, and
even further south, they claim that all Australian
requirements are provided for in their extensive
range of Conveyor, Driving and Elevator belting.
Mine managers are invited to apply to the various

for precipitating impurities and clarifying water in
reservoirs, cattle dams, etc. It is simply thrown
into the reservoir in the form of a solid cake, or
dissolved and added as a liquid. In three hours’
time the most discolored water will be as clear as
crystal. One pound will clear over 2000 gallons of
water. It is exceedingly cheap and quite harmless.

Thus in 15 half-years the divided profit has
averaged 31s. Id. per ton of ore, whereas in
the past half-year the dividend was at the
rate of a fraction ldks than £1 6s. per ton,
and the net profit was as much as £2 Bs. 2d.
per ton. The abnormal price of metals was,
of. course, responsible. No average metal
prices are quoted in this co.’s report; but
the Broken Hill Prop, recently showed that
the average for lead for the half-year to the
end of May was £32 3s. 4d., which is about
£3.8 above the normal, and for zinc (spelter)
£BB 175., which is about £65 per ton above
normal. The South Co. does not itself pro-
duce zinc concentrates, having sold its cur-
rent output to the Amalgamated (De
Bavay’s) on terms whieli give the mining
co. a first small cut and 50 p.c. of the bal-
ance realised after the treatment co. has
taken out its wmrking costs and an equal
small cut. The De Bavay works took 51,317
tons of 16 p.c. “tailings” during the six
months, which would mean about 6700 tons
of zinc, assuming an extraction of a trifle
over 80 p.c. of the metal contents. In
addition 19,388 tons of 17jj p.c. old “tail-
ings” were delivered to the Zinc Corpora-
tion.
The co.’s visible assets at the end of the
half-year were:—
Ore reserves (31/12/’l5), tons.. 3,350,000
Old “tailings,” tons .. . . 872,000
Slimes, tons . . . . . . 447,000
Net liquid assets, £ .. .. 475,124
The ore reserves are calculated only at the
end of the year. Since the last estimation
large ore bodies have been proved to exist
at the 1270 ft. level. No. 126 bore cut
through 99ft. of ore averaging 13.2 p.c. lead,
6.20 z. silver and 11.3 p.c. zinc. This com-
pares satisfactorily with the average value
of the ore mined from all levels during the
half-year—l4.s p.c. lead, 6.80 z. silver and
13.4 p.c. zinc. If 2,312,619 tons have in 7J
years given £1,280,000 in dividends, 3,350,000
tons should give £1,800,000. In addition to
that there are the slimes and the net liquid
assets; the value of the old tailings cannot
be added, because during the years the
profits from the mine have been enhanced
by large drafts upon these dumps. In other
words, the £1,280,000 is the profit from the
miue and the old dumps so far as they have
been drawn upon. But the slimes are a
new asset. These have only just been
attacked by selective flotation: for the week
ended July 22 this process dealt with 363
tons, separating the lot into two classes.
I irst there were 54 tons of lead concen-
trates, containing 88 p.c. of the lead and
90.9 p.c. of the silver; then there were 309
tons of residues containing 87.1 p.c. of the
zinc. The lead concentrates are loaded with
10.6 p.c. of zinc, which would be better if
it were somewhere else, though the propor-
tion isn’t prohibitive; the zinc concentrate
contains only 1.5 p.c. lead. The separation
is a triumph of skill and patience in hand-
ling a singularly difficult metallurgical pro-
position. It is quite a mistake to suppose
that the only great and patient research
chemists and engineers are in Germany. As
a matter of cold fact, though Germany and
Belgium collared the zinc, they only did so
after Australians had overcome the tremen-
dous difficulties connected with the prelimi-
nary concentration of the ore. That was a
problem which the Germans, through Ullrich
and his associates, were the first to attack-
on a commercial scale, at any rate—in
Australia; and they failed.
But though the mine would pay £3,800.000
in dividends without the help of the slimes
if it made the average profits of the past
74 years—which have contained some very
lean years as well as fat —this paper is
making no prophecies. Costs have increased
very much: according to manager
Wainwright the recent award makes a dif-
ference of £46,200 a year to the co. And
over the 11 or 12 years which the mine can
see ahead, this will consume as much as the
present stocks of slimes are likely to be
worth. On the other hand, improvements
in extraction are being constantly made;
but they, again, are largely counter-
balanced by the increasing unkindness of
the ore as it goes down. There are 200.000
shares in the co. Finally, in estimating
what these shares may be worth, it is just
as __well to remember that no ore below
3270 ft. is taken into the estimate.
* * * *
With many other people The Bulletin
understood that in its flotation the Amal-
gamated Insurance, Ltd., hnd the help of the
brilliant but erratic brain of Earle Hermann.
This paper is, however, assured that “the
person named had absolutely nothing to do
with the establishment of the company or
any of the subsidiary companies.”

The Australian Electric Steel Co., in
which contractor Teasdale Smith is under-
stood to be interested, claims to have a pro-
cess for producing electrolytic steel straight
from the ore, and when Tasmanian Minister
Propsting was in Sydney the other day its
representatives asked if his Government
would supply power for working the iron-ore
deposits in the north-western parts of the
State, mentioning that they expected to want
1500 h.p. for a start. Propsting told them
they could have the power all right when
it was available. The Speck, he said, was
now looking at the Arthur Lakes and Lake
River power proposition (mentioned B.
10/8/Tb), and added that if that scheme
went through there would be a lot of enei’gy
on hand for the northern end of the island.

The inquiry by Lloyd Bloxsome, of the
Westralian Chamber of Mines, concerning
the Edna Central blunder ended as expected.
Manager Dick Williams mistook the 9oz.
code word for the 9dwt. term, and didn’t
awake to the mix-up till Melbourne asked
for confirmation. Then the fat was in the
fire. No correction could be got through till
the following morning, thus giving time for
the pretty scrum between bull and bear to
be played out. Bloxsome certifies that his
“investigations do not disclose any evidence
or suspicion that anyone was in possession
of the knowledge that a mistake had been
made.” So Williams’s luck was dead out
when his directors decided he should go
from the mine he had nursed from baby-
hood.
* * * *
From Westonia: —
Although the recent striking of the Edna May reef
in the Deeps practically assures more than the pre-
sent market price in dividends for Edna May share-
holders, strong selling still proceeds. Old Aus-
tralian supporters are tiring of market manipula-
tions and are reducing their holdings as opportuni-
ties offer. This no doubt is what the manipulators
want, as when old supporters are squeezed out the
strings can be pulled with a view to another rise.
But if the rise does occur it will be without the aid
of Westralian supporters, for as far as they are con-
cerned the market operators’ can have the field to
themselves next time. The mine is good, and its
prospective value considerable; but the bears have
had a good win, selling down from £8 and recover-
ing the stock at about £5, less a number of divi-
dends lost. What with being caught by the Central
bull and the Edna May bear Westralians have had a
bad time during the past six months.
Deeps’ prospects are better; but whether the stock
is worth 365. is another matter. It is proved, how-
ever, that the continuation of the Edna May lode is
in Deeps ground at 480 ft., and that is not a bad com-
mencement. Deeps has a big development programme
ahead, but it runs the risk of a big inflow of water. Still,
the co. has accomplished a great deal, and its career
as a serious mining proposition may be said to have
commenced, provided the sinking of the main shaft
can be continued free from serious water troubles.
Central’s old manager, Dick Williams, has de-
parted, and N. E. Giblin has taken over the show.
Owing to a vigorous kick the yield for August is
likely to show some improvement on recent figures,
but the mine is looking no better. It has been
working three years now, and has paid only £3OOO in
dividends. The market values the mine at £9O,(MX).
Concerning the various other shows at Westonia,
they are all reported as being on stone “just like
that of the Edna May.” But though Westonia has
been a mining centre for a number of years, outside
Edna May and Central no dividends have been
sighted.
* * *• *
It looks as if there won’t be many more
Board fees for Commodore (W.A.) directors
from the present show; for there is nothing
better than road metal at No. 4 level. The
co., however, intends to have a go at the
Macquarie lease next door, where there is
talk of lOdwt. dirt. Why hasn’t somebody
fastened on to the claim before this?
Dunno.
* * * *
As a result of a winding-up petition in
Perth the other day, Ida H. is to be com-
pulsorily liquidated, subject to a meeting of
unsecured creditors. The petitioning credi-
tor said that the co. had asked for time, and
had offered its mine plant as security. But
as second hand plant is not of much more
value than scrap-iron in the backblocks of the
West, the security did not appeal to him.
* * * *
For a mine that depends largely on what
is left in the old levels, South Kalgurli did
well last year. Revenue amounted to
£147.832, while expenditure (inclusive of
London office exes. and depreciation)
totalled £131.497. Divs. absorbed £12.500
and £4540 was carried forward. Working
costs averaged 20s. 9d. per ton, which,
despite the difficulties of working and the
advance in the price of stores, is only Id.
more than last year’s figures.
* * * *
Oroya Links (W.A.) has had a lean year,
receipts exceeding exes, by only £3(35. The
resident-manager’s estimate of ore reserves
is 1t>6,300 tons, worth 245. 7d.; 8., M. and
Co., the general managers, calculate 158.622
tons averaging 245. 3d. Both reckon there
is a considerable tonnage of probable ore not
yet sufficiently blocked out for measurement
or sampling. Costs at 19s. lid. were up a
little compared with the previous year. The
co.’s liquid assets totalled £56,215.
* * * *
A circular issued from the office of Corin-
thian North (W.A.) confirms the statement
(B. 10/8/T6) that the co. may have to
knock off on account of scarcity of skilled
labor and the high cost of stores. Dorrie
Doolette sank the best part of £70,000 in
this show, besides dropping another £20,000
or more in other unreproductive ventures in
the West, yet the lie is still being circulated
that he has put nothing back into the coun-
try that gave him his lift.
When the derelict smelters at Zeehan
(Tas.) were alive they were mostly German-
owned, and things are tangled now. The
State Government lent £20,000 to keep them
going, and they appear to be a sort of joint
owners, by virtue of their mortgage, with the
Deutsche Bank. Other people are said to
have some interest in them, and no one seems
to know whether they can be sold or not.
The Mount Lyell Co. has been negotiating to
buy them for use in connection with the
Hercules-Rosebery business, but can’t get
for’ard. So, to be on the safe side, it has
sent a man down to look out another site.
* * * *
“A.C.G.”: Though the Lyell Co. has a
pretty tight grip on the Tas. West Coast,
and has the pick of the Read-Rosebery
mines, there is still gleaning for enterprising
outsiders in that mineral field. Its dimen-
sions are laid down by Government Geolo-
gist Hills as seven miles by I£, which pro-
vides a fair scope for the occurrence of ore
bodies wherever the calcareous bands of
schist have provided the necessary neutralis-
ing agent for the deposition of the zinc-lead
sulphides. One of these has been optioned
by the Gillies-Ditchburn Melbourne party.
It was prospected for copper 20-odd years
ago under the name of the Jupiter, and
has a lode, according to Zeehan assayer
Adam Morton, 10ft. wide, bulking 8 p.c. cop-
per. Subsequently zinc-lead sulphide bodies
were struck and worked while the Zeehan
Smelters were running, 6400 tons being
treated for the gold, silver and lead (4dwt.
gold, 13oz. silver and 124 p.c. lead), and 600
tons exported as zinc ore averaging 45 p.c.
Since the shutting down of the smelters
further prospecting has made available for
stoping according to Morton’s figures 4000
to 5000 tons zinc-lead ore, and bulk parcels
have been tested by the Hydro-Electric
Metallurgical Co. which claims a recovery by
its process of over 90 p.c. of the values, the
ore assaying 39 p.c. zinc, 12.6 p.c. lead,
4dwt. gold and 13oz. silver. The owners
are now forming a 40,000-share co. of 10s.,
6000 paids being retained by the promoters
and 10,000 held" in reserve to be issued to
the owners a year after the end of the war,
or £4OOO cash, as they may prefer. If the
thing goes through the results from the rival
processes should be worth studying. Mean-
time geologist Hills has laid down a diamond-
drill scheme for testing the whole belt, and a
start is being made at the Rosebery Blocks,
while two or three other claims have taken
heart and are driving tunnels. With regard
to their chances of success it is worth noting
that these sulphides are proved to occur
from a height of 2900 ft. above sea level to
virtually sea level in the lowest bores of the
Tas. Copper Co. at Rosebery.
* * * *
The mostly-Sydney-owned cement-making
proposition at Ida Bay (Tas.) has been
offered to the Speck’s Government at
£35,000. There is a glowing report on it
by the Government Geologist, but the Minis-
try doesn’t seem able to make up its mind
either to take it or to leave it.
* * * *
Tributors are keeping Victoria Consols,
Bendigo, on the go, but when 2400 tons pan
out only 890 oz. they consider it time to pro-
test against the skyrocketing of the price of
mine supplies. The co. itself hasn’t done
well with the work carried out on the Iron-
bark reef at 512 ft., so it intends working
overhead on the east wall to see if more
stone and better gold lurk there. A brighter
prospect is the little west leg on the Central
Blue reef, where tributors on the east
side of the cap are on fair gold. In the
1000 ft. to the boundary a lot may happen,
and there is also 400 ft. of undeveloped
ground to the north to hack at. As the Cen-
tral Blue line is the fashion on the Mall just
now the co.’s shares are having a run. But
that does not make a mine.

So out of £368,889 gold won shareholders
have received only £19.000 against £83,000
cash subscribed. Last half-year 1878 fathoms
gave 14160 z., an average of 15dwt., and that
was just outside the pay limit. Better wash
is now in the face, and the whole lead can be
tackled instead of a narrow gutter; so the
gritty crowd in the show intends to give the
mine another run.

For the past six months Cock’s Pioneer,
Eldorado (Vic.), showed a meagre profit of
£3399, against £10,843 for the previous term.
The drop in the grade of the dirt was sud-
den —from 14.07dwt. gold and 0.4581 b. tin
oxide to 10.96dwt. gold and 0.2441 b. tin oxide.
Costs on the other hand swung up to 10id.,
including the usual per cub. yd. allow-
ance that goes to the costs suspense account.
The sluicing out of No. 1 paddock was one
cause of dear work, while the old miner
who scraped round the 70ft. floor long before
the Moline era didn’t leave much except
laths and props. No less than 86 p.c. of the
floor opened by Moline during No. 7 run of
the plant had been cleaned up, and 70 p.c.
of the bottom uncovered during No. 8 run
was bare. Up the lead in the shallower
ground conditions will be better. With
that possibility and the big paddock avail-
able to land the drift into, Moline tips “a
substantial improvement in yields” now that
he is closing up No. 9 run. He then can
float his barge close to the face and save
big lifts. Another half-million cubic yards
have been added to the area available up-
stream by boring work, but west at the
4500 ft. line Moline isn’t holding out hopes
of getting pay dirt. On his reports it looks
to be a godsend that Higgs (or Higgins) set
his face against capital being raised for a
No. 2 dredge.

Kulamadau (Woodlark Island) has
crushed 1489 tons for £6725. An average of
over 90s. should be highly payable, because
most of the gold has come from the rich lode
at No. 6 level which was 10ft. wide in the
crosscut. The width of the Kulamadau
lode, however, varies a great deal, and values
are much better near the hanging-wall than
in the centre. .Since its amalgamation with
the old Woodlark Island Prop, this concern
has had a hard struggle; almost as a last
resort it sank No. 1 shaft another lift, and
luckily struck a rich lens of ore in the
crosscut.

MAKES COtJGH SYRUP WITH TAR
AND SUGAR.
A CHEMIST’S RECIPE.
“As a chemist, I have, of course, long
been familiar with the remarkable virtue of
ti irate of tar in the treatment of coughs,
colds, catarrh and bronchial troubles; but
did not give it any thought until one day
my wife contracted a severe cough which
refused to yield to all the usual remedies
from which she sought relief. It then
occurred to me that titrate of tar might be
just the thing, and I decided to make an
experiment with its use. I made a plain
syrup by dissolving half a pound of sugar in
half a pint of hot water and then stirred in
2 ounces of titrate of tar. This made
nearly a pint of a pleasant cough syrup, of
which I told my wife to take two teaspoon-
fuls every hour. By the end of the first day,
much to her astonishment and delight as
well as my own, the cough had disappeared
and has not returned. I was so pleased that
now whenever anyone asks for a cough syrup
I advise the use of this simple home-made
syrup, for I honestly believe it is the best
thing known for coughs, colds, catarrh and
bronchial troubles.” Bitrate of tar, as is
well known, possesses peculiar healing and
soothing properties; and owing to the great
demand for it all leading chemists have
made special arrangements to keen a liberal
supply in stock. — Advt.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, August 28, 1916.
Aly Dear Arini, —
The Commonwealth Bank was officially
opened to a lucky few —the Personages who
passed through the Pitt-street portal. A
huge crowd forgathered .on adjacent kerbs
to watch the celebrities and others —a long
tail —honk their way to the doors that
swung open as noon chimed from the G.P.O.
opposite. Then did a herald’s trumpet
cough out a wheezy fanfare to announce the
G.-G. Fairgusons.
Moore-street was all policemen and barri-
cades. Invited guests, waving their placards,
easily stormed these entanglements, and then
gazed hopefully at the Tower of Finance —
30 storeys of it —they hoped to enter
presently. Careful souls got in the big pen
at 11.30. The casuals came along later.
When 12 strokes hit the air, the
awful truth dawned. Some hundreds
too many invitations had fluttered through
the post. The great glass windows —
in summer they’ll make the clerks feel like
exotics in a hothouse —revealed the tragedy.
The Bank was chock-a-block long before the
Moore-street entrance opened. Presently a
glass door, edged with gold paint, was pulled
back and there was a wild rush to get inside.
“Keep back there!” commanded the peris
in blue. But a few desperate men, dragging
their feminine belongings after them, con-
trived to do what they had come for —give
the pleasure of their presence to the opening
ceremony.
Unable to get back, forbidden to advance,
the invited guests saw, afar off, the G.-G
deliver an oration at the head of marble
steps. Our Billy, the Bank’s Governor
(Denison Miller), and Federal Treasurer
Tggs were other speakers.
Perhaps the most disgusted countenance
was that of Prof. Andy Stuart, marooned in
Moore-street, and treated as one of the herd.
The staff had a shivoo next evening. Their
play-place in the Bank is near Heaven. A
long musical programme had a hole in the
centre, and Deputy-Governor Kell filled it
by giving Denison Miller an oblation from
the staff. It’s his own portrait, by Norman
Carter.
And that’s all I can tell you about the
Commonwealth Bank.
Governor Strickland tore aside the official
veil which hid a new Tourist Bureau from
an inquisitive public. If you want to know
how much of Tasmania you can see for how
little, go and worry its representative at
262 George-street. W. B. Propsting, Minis-
ter for the Small Island’s Railways, made a
few remarks; and the State Ex., who was
once Governor of the little plot, spread
treacle all over its scenery.
Dr. H. Ward, son of the D.T.’s woolly old
ex-editor, has been wounded a second time in
France. lie stopped a few bits.of shrapnel
last September and took some time to re-
cover. Rejoining his regiment, the brilliant
youngster—he was one of our Rhodes
scholars —was sent to Loos, where he was
again wounded on August 20.
Verbrugghen, who intended to conduct
Saturday’s Symphony concert, was busy,
entertaining ’flu ; so Slap., whose 4 regular
job it is, shook a stick about the size of a
pen-handle at the fiddlers. The usual late
arrivals, knowing that Henri w T as not to
be in charge, stamped in at any old time.
The big Berlioz “Overture Cellini” took the
chill off the programme. Then came fiddler
Jennie Cullen as soloist in the beautiful
concerto (never mind its exact Minor num-
ber) by Vieuxtemps. Hitherto the girl
from Glasgie hasn’t given us anything
extra for the money she cost us. But her
performance on Saturday afternoon paid
the debt. Brilliant in technique, her bow
played like summer lightning amidst the
thunder of the orchestra. When the. storm
had passed little Jennie got the first ova-
tion Sydney has given her. She ducked her
head like a schoolboy to show how much
she liked it. Recalled by the tumult, she
ducked again—and ran away with her arms
full of flowers.
Colonel Burnage, C. 8., one of the best-
liked commanders who led Australians up
Gallipoli cliffs, goes to England shortly. A
young wife will be waiting on London docks.
Damages to one hand still keep him out of
the m@lee. Battalion dames said good-bye
over the teacups the other afternoon.
That stout parcel of energetic ideas,
George Crowley, the life-assurance man, saw
his father over the hill last week. The old
gentleman, whose front name was Jeremiah,
had tanned many a North Shore boy who
is old enough now to chuckle over it. Close
on 60 years ago he brought his bit of a
shtielc from Ireland, and he swung it to good
purpose until 20 years ago, mostly in a
school at St. Leonards.
Mrs. George Black writes to her Chief
Secretary from Paris. She surges with
enthusiasm for beautiful France —that por-
tion of it beyond the Hun’s heel —its
cornfields abloom with scarlet poppies, and
only divided by green-leafed Normandy pop-
lars, with here and there an old chateau
embosomed in trees. Of her own health —the
object of her trip—-she speaks hopefully.
Between spells of treatment by the Paris
expert, Dr. Degrais, the Australian woman
will see something of Britain in war-time.
Though the preliminary meeting to raise
funds for the Italian Red Cross consisted
chiefly of cane chairs, success is bound to
come. But later on. Just now Sydney is
concentrating on the French League concert,
to be held on September 20.
Here is Miss
Mary Strickland,
bis Ex.’s eldest
daughter. She put
her golden hair up
on the voyage from
the West three
years ago, and
isn’t eligible for a
vote for a while
yet. In spite of
being an infant in
law, the Governor’s
treasure has taken
part in the big fly-
ing exhibition this
week. It’s the
opening of our
Aviation School at
Richmond. As a
spinning maiden,!
Miss Strickland started the fashion among
Australian girls. It made a timorous
appearance last year. Then, while the
family was summering at Sutton Forest,
the original of this Judith Fletcher photo,
took lessons at Hillview. Now it’s the
thing to do. The practical girl can, besides,
play a type machine with the best, though
I’m not sure whether she dots down father’s
remarks in shorthand. Quite unspoiled,
she can take a delicate mother’s place in
public, and she can enjoy a romping
game of tennis with lively young sisters.
And, to round it all off, she’s a hostess who
has a way of seeking out the almost-for-
gotten (if any) and filling them with con-
fidence and other good things.
Our Second Best People—our Best being
busy elsewhere —spent a recent evening en-
joyably in St. James’s Hall. The profits go
to Gunner Smith, now on the rocks at Ral-
ston. Vaudeville, of course, breezy and
amusing in parts, and sometimes rather —
well, even the curate’s egg wasn’t all that it
might have been. Dorothy Gordon, a pro-
found student of music-hall turns and rag-
ging, hit it off very w T ell in a Chinatown
sketch —rolling eyes, gorgeous heathen lin-
gerie, and suitable chorus. Slim Vera Alex-
ander, a dainty maiden in buttercup flounces,
sang sweetly of winking stars. Tremendous
applause. An intermittent tableau, with
Mary Grimley, Allies about three-feet-
nothing in height, and infant gum knuts
opened the' show. The tableau, “Australia
Awakening,” wasn’t as steady as it might
have been, and one gum knut yawned audi-
bly. The best turn was Winnie Mitchell’s
slave dance. A golden-liaired houri, clad in
gorgeous harem lingerie—pyjamas in excel sis
—she doubled up in the manner of an ele-
gant indiarubber doll. The incidental music
was like witches’ broth when it comes to the
boil. Local society rolled up to fill seven-
and-sixpenny seats and enjoy the antics of
its friends. The usual sleek-haired Percies
were in attendance. More comfy than the
trenches—what? But the five-shiliing gallery
was half-empty, for the public can’t be
entangled by amateur shows—at the price.
Open-hearted dentist John Kain has
passed into Shadowland after ailing
for some time. He picked up in
the U.S.A. all that was worth know-
ing about teeth and their casualties, and
has been firmly established in Macquarie-
street for more years than one cares to re-
member. His profuse generosity and a
habit of tearing up the bills of needy patients
has probably left his widow not over-well
off. Yet she might have been a rich woman
but for John’s way with his tenants. When
an exasperated agent had for many weeks
failed to get any rent for his employer
(tenants had a habit of “playing up” to
their landlord’s well-known easy temper) he
occasionally dragged a half-promise to be
allowed to put a bailiff in, and hurriedly did
the deed. In the afternoon the tenants, as
a rule, indignantly rang up their landlord to
know what he meant by it. Whereupon John
would leave his rooms, take a cab to the
premises, reprimand the bailiff, pay all that
was owing—to himself —and take the in-
truder back to town.
The Shaw-Nott wedding was fully floral
in St. Philip’s Church. Dick Shaw, the
’groom, is a son of the generous VV. E.
Shaw who handed over a suburban mansion,
Penlee, for a Nurses’ Rest Home. An alter-
native nest at the Albany is, however .silk-
lined. Bride Leslie (father is Alan 'Nott)
was dressed in the last minute’s fashion
white with a blush of pale pink under the
long silk tail. Decorations: Honiton lace,
orange blossoms. Second-best man: H.
Scrivener, who gave his arm to bridesmaiden
Dorothy Shaw. Honeymoon: North of the
pineapples.
Toy dogs had their second annual outing
in the Showgrounds last week. Most of
them—the Pekinese and Pomeranians especi-
ally—arrived in motors. They would, you
know. Mrs. Nisbet, formerly of Towns-
ville, where hubby had a big practice, took
first prize for one of her large family of
Pekin pets. The champion petrolled to the
show and turned a contemptuous fluffy tail
to the adulation of mere strangers. Arthur
Albert and W. J. Curtis were prize-winners
with lady Poms.
Justice Heydon’s son, a surgeon-captain,
has won the Military Cross in France. He
was considered rather a delicate young man
a few years ago: lie burnt too much mid-
night gas at his ’Varsity studies. But he is
said to have thrived so well on open air and
bully beef that he’s now steadily putting on
weight.
The Mater Misericordiae Hospital, North
Sydney, is hard up. The wolf is not exactly
on the doorstep, but he howls in the yard.
Mrs. Forsyth, Willoughby’s Mayoress, is
president of a committee which is organised
to get subscriptions. Adjacent suburbs have
sworn to help.
A raid for the Ist and 53rd Battalion
Comforts Fund was well organised by Mrs.
Glanville. Results, a steady flow cash
into the Christmas stockings. Mrs. Kenna,
the Lane Mullins girls, Mrs. Metcalfe and
other lady pirates took it out of the public
on three successive days.
The convalescents of the George’s Head
Hospital and “Details” Camp gave a concert
to the local V.A.D.’s and residents there-
about last week. Major Lynch was the
official host. The musical programme was
sandwiched with fencing and boxing turns,
to say nothing of some real live thuds that
a jiu-jitsu exhibition brought about on the
padded stage. After the sing-song a dance.
George Meudell and his wife are back, like
homing pigeons, from California. What!
Never heard of George, the rolling stone who
has an advt. for Australia pasted on every
corner? Just now he’s at the Australia.
Concerning his very latest travels, he says
that, contrary to a general belief, clothes
are not half so dear in ’Frisco and Los
Angeles as they are in Sydney. So the
belles saunter through palatial hotels clad
in sumptuous Glad Rags. They're not in the
throes of winning a war, of course, and hotels
are -opened till the morning milkcans rattle.
In spite of this glitter, there’s been no
exodus to the States from this city.
Mrs. Francis
Anderson, wife of
a Sydney Uni. pro-
fessor, was one of
the founders of the
Free Kindergarten
in this town. They
have an annual
meeting, by the
way, on September
12. It’s to be at
Government House.
Besides barracking
for the children of
mean streets, and
heading deputations
to get them play-
grou n d s, Mrs.
Anderson, who is a
fluent speaker, is
one of the litterati
and something of a blue-stocking. Recently she
shed an epigram for the benefit of the city’s
stepfathers in the Town Hall. At the Citi-
zens’ Association the ’Varsity lady, think-
ing of those uncovered garbage-tins the in-
spectors never see, described Sydney with its
exquisite water-front as “wearing a diamond
necklet on a dirty dress.”
Albert Goossens, having temporarily lost
his invaluable voice—the usual winter cold
—went off to the Mountains to get it back.
The Belgian singer is a great favorite with
fellow-teachers at the Conservatorium. They
say he carries no frill and wears a non-
explosive temper.
Curious how the camera sees things. Mrs.
Billy Hughes has a reasonable grievance
against the lens that usually makes an in-
different effort to reproduce her pleasant
face. She’s a tall and graceful woman,
besides. But the snapshot can’t crowd that
into its impressions.
The news of young Rex Buckland’s death in
France prostrated a fond mother, but didn’t
postpone a sister’s wedding. A hundred
or so guests were hurriedly asked not to
come, and the girl, attended only by a few
members of the family, kept her tryst in
square-boned All Saints’, with Dr. Clayton
as the other contracting party.
The Arthur Dowlings go to Europe in the
Osterley to see son Brian, who has qualified
for air work and is somewhere in France.
Another son, Max, a lieutenant, recently
died of wounds. Mrs. Dowling will remain
in England for some' time; Mr. Dowling
expects to return in six months.
Of course you remember pianist Kathar-
ine Goodson, who gave recitals here a few
years ago. The cult acclaimed her as one of
the most charming musicians who ever
struck a bald patch of Austrian chairs in
our Town Hall. It didn’t hurt her much,
for she was holidaying here with hubby. He
is the Hinton who is one of the Royal
Academy examiners. They recently passed
through Sydney after an examining tour
on his part. The elegant Katharine—a
slender, Burnes Jones figure—has been
Incog., a thing royalties and politicians only
take to in emergencies.
Mosman is going to build a cottage for a
damaged warrior. For a start a local
patriot, Mrs. Gray, gave the land, and Chief
Justice Cullen handed over a five-pound note.
To the same end the district Boy Sprouts
manoeuvred the other day. The very junior
son of former G.-G. Dudley was, by the way,
attached to the Mosman Sprouts during the
period that his little legs stretched them-
selves on this part of the Federated States.
The Royal Art Society’s Show opens this
Saturday, when President luster Lister will
meet you near the entrance.
A man back from London tells me that
low’s “Imperial Conference” cartoon
('Speak to him in Welsh, David, and
pacify him”) hit London’s eye as hard as it
did Australia’s. Little Billy, the hero of it,
was called on to sign 20 copies for members
of the Cabinet; and Lloyd George (the
“David” of it) had to have two. The origi-
nal—for which the G.-G. put in a prompt
claim—has been hung in the Federal Parlia-
ment library.
The black cloaks and bonnet-streamers of
the St. John Ambulance Brigadiers fluttered
in Sydney Domain on Saturday when Gov-
ernor Strickland reviewed the ladies who
bandage so beautifully and look like skim-
ming black-and-white birds when going
against the wind. Their stretcher-bearing
brothers, in their neat, black, undertakerish
uniforms, marched side by side with them,
and though it was a unique chance for some-
body to indulge in a serious accident, nobody
obliged. Long before the real performance
started I saw an early squad—all black
cloaks and white aprons—rehearsing their
drill under a grey-haired directress, who
ordered them to “As you were!” in a faint,
afternoon-tea voice. A skilled and kindly
dame, no doubt, but the feeblest imitation of
a roaring sergeant-major I ever discovered.
Marjorie Earp, a daughter of George,
M.L.C., has accepted a diamond from Staff-
sergeant Lewis Curnow, of the 4th Battalion.
After being severely damaged in Gallipoli
he is having his health nursed back by Mother
Australia. The pair were sweethearts when
they were young enough to exchange boiled
101-lols.
Manager Freddie Shipman recently blew
in for a moment. He feels like —well, like
a man who has been chased by somebody
else’s luck. His mascotte is Dufault, who
has been the sensation of Brisbane, witih
suitable treasury results.
Major Windeyer’s wounds, “hip and
shoulder,” are not very serious. So Sister
Margaret, chief Lady Bookworm in the
Mitchell Library, is greatly uplifted after
months of tense watching of casualty lists.
The soldier, who is the youngest of the late
Judge’s sons, has seen nearly everything of
interest in Gallipoli, though he missed the
Landing by a few weeks. Lately he has
been chasing Turks in Egypt.
The Red Cross is sending every sick and
wounded man at the interminable Front a
pipe, ’baccy, boiled sweets, etc. Joint hon.
secs, in Sydney, Marjorie Mort and Gladys
Owen, foot the appeal for these Chi’istmas
remembrances.
Queer people these naturalists. Lance
Harrison, B.Sc., who made a splash at Cam-
bridge since he left Sydney two years back,
is as joyful over his trip to Mesopotamia
as if it were the Garden of Eden. As you
know, he goes as entomologist to the British
forces. While Lance pursues insects in
tropic swamps, Mrs. Lance, who used to
be Amy Mack, waits for news in England.
Louise, of the big Mack family, is returning
to Queensland. A brother is settled in
Russia; another in Harley-street, London.
But that’s only four of a dozen or so.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

The Question of
Motor Tyre Prices.
WHY IMPORTED ::::
COVERS ARE DEARER.
Few motorists realise that the extra
cost that is charged for imported
tyres is attributable solely to the
fact that heavy import duties—run-
ning into pounds —high freights,
etc., have to be added to the
selling price to you. When
you purchase Australian-made
DUNLOP
TYRES
you pay only for the highest qual-
ity rubber that is put into a tyre,
the best cotton that the world can
produce, and usually a one-ply
heavier casing. The mode of
manufacture embodies every up-to-
date process incorporated in im-
ported tyres. This you pay for,
but you don’t have to pay pounds
extra for no return—money (your
money) that simply goes to pay
custom duties etc. Few users of
imported tyres have given thought
to the fact that they pay an en-
hanced price for nothing. We
can assert with confidence that
our present white tread “ Dunlops”
—in Grooved, Three Ribbed and
Rubber Non-Skid -have no super-
ior in the world for Quality, Wear,
and Reliability, and yoa can
purchase same at a lower figure
than imported tyres simply because
you save pounds that the importer
has to add to the price of his goods.
Fit “Dunlops” and save money!

Melbourne, August 28, 1916.
My Dear Yauiue, —
The Charity Organisation Society of Vic-
toria had Governor Stanley to preside at its
annual meeting, so the public now knows
that Government House “has had occasion to
avail itself of the society’s services.” The
C.O.S. has been a going concern for 29 years,
and still hides its glimmer under a bushel of
public indifference. It runs a cheap-labor
bureau; investigates the “cases” that submit
themselves, finding 10 per cent, of them
impostures; issues meal-tickets and hands out
such small cash doles and other “relief” as
its cramped funds permit. But, above
everything, it exists as a means by which the
citizen, worried by demands on his “charity,”
may hand over a few guineas, year by year,
and have it attend to such matters for him,
in exactly the same way as his butcher
attends to his chop-needs and the baker his
daily crust-requirements.
Floris Levy, who is working with the
Y.M.G.A. to supply fighting men abroad with
pictures of the baby in its new pram., or
little sister nursing the cat in the back
garden, now has several hundred helpers in
various parts of Victoria. Anybody wishing
to have a photo, taken to send to her soldier
simply fills in an application form at the
nearest P.O. and posts it to the Y.M.C.A.
One of the Association’s amateurs does the
rest without charge. Such a pleasant little
scheme needs no back-patting, but it can do
with all the advertisement it gets.
Lieut. Charles Langtree, killed the other
day while helping with the big guns in
France, belonged to a woolly family whose
womenfolk, a few years ago, were well frilled
flutterers around the candle in Melbourne.
The original Langtree ranch is at Benalla,
but young Charlie was running his own
mutton at Warrenbayne. He was a hefty
Australian, without side, and played several
games well. At one period he followed the
ball for Collingwood.
The rich Cooper girl (heiress of the Ben-
digo Watson Coopers) who married Bendigo
Mueller has a nursing job at St. George’s
Military Hospital, Colombo. The children
are to be mother’s anxiety while plump
young Mrs. Mueller is away mothering
soldiers. The young matron went to Egypt
first to try her hand there, and made an
application at St. George’s on her way home.
Sister Ivy Cooper, who had theatrical ambi-
tions, has just been married in London to
one Gordon. Her bridegroom belongs to an
Australian firm of Murray Brothers. The
sisters are waiting to hear further wedding
news.
The dancing Hyams cannot bear the re-
straint of war any longer, and a ball is to
happen on Thursday, Septemoer 14, in the
St. Kilda Town Hall. Tickets are four
shillings each, and the Red Cross will benefit.
D. M. Pearson, who would rather fix a
motor trip for a party of wounded soldiers
than eat, is a big, cheerful optimist with a
gift for organising. He is admiral of the
Red Cross Volunteer Motor Corps, and when
he sends word to a country, centre that he
is awheel with a car-load his rural helpers
hang out flags and food. The latest idea
afoot is to fix up picnic trips for inter State
soldiers when a hospital ship is in port for
a couple of days.
Melba has really been very ill with ’flu;
nevertheless the dames of the Lyceum Club
were irritable at her non arrival at their
effort for the Russian Red Cross. Melba
had “promised,” and they’d paid five shil-
lings to see the grand lady who didn’t arrive.
It was most annoying. The Club rooms
were packed with social battle-cruisers spit-
ting fire and dropping conversational mines.
Mrs. Grebin, a young Russian, lectured on
the development of Russian music, samples
of which were played by two small mando-
liners in lovely red riding boots. Stresla
Wilson and Ann Williams also sang; and
Melba-disappointed women were comforted
with tea and coffee.
The general annual meeting of the Guild
of Service for Soldiers (Halt!) was held
on Tuesday, August 15. President Mrs.
Robert Harper congratulated the members
on their work —10,000 articles of wear, 5000
bandages, 900 bundles of old linen, all rolled,
packed for transport and forwarded to the
central Red Cross depot. It’s an emu
feather in the hat of South Yarra, where
the Guild flourishes.
Aloysius Kelly, brother of Bowes, is
marching about town with his chest well
out, for his schoolboy soldier has gone up
another step. The commissioned youngster
is distinguished from all the other Kellys
that walk the earth by his unusual front
name —Wallscourt. The tall Bowes .Kelly
boy has been wounded and is recovering in
an English hospital.
After doing 18 years’ peace soldiering the
tall, lean Colonel Henry Harper badly
wanted to see what the real thing was like.
No hope! There was some chronic leg
weakness, and a bad attack of typhoid six
years ago had left him unfit to tackle sol-
diers’ fare on active service. He was told
to rest content and be useful here as
embarkation officer, instead of going abroad
to be no use to anybody.
The confessions of Adelaide: —
Despite violent protestations, the amusement tax
is, apparently, to come. Premier Vaughan has intro-
duced his Bill, and is “more convinced than ever”
of the fairness of getting £30,000 that way.
Part of the rain that has given us the wettest
winter on record fell on Saturday, when there were
races at Victoria Park and mixed foursomes at
Seaton in aid of the French Red Cross. The former
festivity was mostly mud and a £27 dividend in
the Fulham Park Plate. At Seaton there were many
players and more onlookers, among them the Gal-
ways, with bridge and afternoon tea as sidelines.
The late Federal Speaker Holder’s son, who
enlisted as a private and has been on service since
.May, 1915, has got his commission.
Parliament will cease from troubling for a brief
space in September. The official reason is that it is
the “custom” to adjourn for a week, and that even
if there isn’t a Show this year there are other things
—including a Labor Congress. One of the newest
Bills is for qualifying women to sit in Parliament.
In some quarters it has met with a tepid reception.
In any case it is pretty certain that a woman could
sit without the Bill if she wanted to. The measure
is merely to dear up a doubt which someone in the
Crown Law Office has been smitten with..
From London comes news of the death of the
wife of G. P. Doolette, the lately-knighted Kal-
goorlionaire. She was the daughter of a Congrega-
tional Church potentate. The first wife was a
daughter of George McEwin, of the Glen Ewin
jammery.
A museum expedition for the collection of natural
history specimens in Central Australia is to leave
in early September. The route will be eastward from
Farina to Strzelecki Creek, thence to Innamincka,
on the Queensland border, returning via Cooper’s
Creek. The Director of the Museum, Mr. Waite,
will lead the expedition, and with him will be
Capt. A. S. White. In 1907 Waite went with a
party sent by the Canterbury University to the sub-
Antarctic islands of Maoriland, and in 1913 he was
with Mawson on Macquarie Island.
We may have an aviation school, too. Professor
Kerr Grant first mooted the idea, and Goodman, of
the Tramways, offered to make investigations during
his visit to Sydney. The Premier’s opinion is that
aviation is more than a matter of defence. “Aviation
as a means of transport must come, although, as far
as we can see, it is a long way off yet.” So he isn’t
hurrying to pay off the debt on our railways.
Died on Saturday, “Ned” Colton, son of a former
Premier. He was a well-known lawyer, who got his
training from Josiah Symon.
In the fairly near future military consumptive
patients will be cared for by the State, and the
P.M.O. (Dr. Russell) and the Inspector-General of
Hospitals (Dr. Morris) are looking for a site for the
new institution.
Violet Day—a national memorial to Australians
who have fallen on service—-was celebrated on Friday.
The arrangements for the day were in the hands of
the Cheer-Up Society, to whose funds the proceeds
go.
The biter had a couple of pieces taken out of his
pocket in the Hills the other day. The biter was a
sportive party of motorists who raided a market-
gardener’s cart from the back, collared some cauli-
flowers, and then sailed gaily away making ribald
remarks at the sleepy driver. Half an hour later the
party was still stuck hard and fast in the sand of an
icy-cold creek when help arrived. It was the market-
glardener! Help? Oh, certainly—but it would cost
’em a couple of pounds. And of course they had to
pay.
News has been received in Adelaide that Private
Philip Mark Webb is missing. It is a reminder
that he presented himself eight times before he was
finally accepted. But he was not the sort to stand
back. Before he was 15 he had been awarded a
Royal Humane medal for rescuing five people from
drowning. A brother, A. 8., who was lately asso-
ciate to Justice Gordon, was rejected, placed himself
under the surgeon’s knife, and then got into the
rarks. Another brother was killed at Gallipoli.
Alee Poynton, M.H.R., has had a sad time lately.
Some time ago his son was drowned on the way to
Gallipoli. Then his nephew was killed at the Front.
Now his youngest brother David is dead in Melbourne
of meningitis.
Something called “Le Bal des Patineurs”
filled the Glaciarium on Saturday night—the
plain Australian of it was a Skaters’ Ball.
It was a giddy revel. Crowds of girls got
into colored pyjamas finished off with big
tulle Pierrette ruffs. One girl in green-satin
trousers hadn’t rigged herself properly, and
her inward clothes climbed round her neck in
frills. Most of the men were in khaki. Lesley
Madden, an ardent rinker, sat in the mana-
ger’s box in plain dress looking on and listen-
ing to de Gilio’s band. Manager Douglas
Russell had provided an original decorative
scheme. Millions of red rose petals were sus-
pended just overhead by white snow nets,
and large, soft-colored lights were made to
look like street lamps on a misty night.
Lieutenant Keith Walker gave an exhibition
of fancy skating. This airy young man has
just been transferred to the Flying Corps,
and will soon be off and away. The skating
girls will miss him. Bobby Jackson, the
amateur theatrical, did a skating tango with
his wife. They depart presently to an
engagement in New York.
Alice McCulloch, of Woodlands station
(Woodlands was tne favorite resort of the
late Mopetoun when he got into his bush
duds), is in town and that she
isn’t allowed to do real nursing. She has a
motor-car, a large, snow-white riding hack,
and a suite of rooms at the Oriental; but
these things don’t satisfy her. She had
charge of a whole ward in Egypt, and was
allowed the privilege of nursing for 16 hours
at a time without tood or rest. When you’ve
sacrificed yourself in such heroic fashion
the ordinary scrubbing and dusting job that
waits for the social volunteer seems a poor
thing.
Mrs. Connolly—the dainty little Dresden-
china wife of racing-man Eric Connolly—
gave a farewell party at the Savoy on Fri-
day. She has departed for Sydney with her
babies and the nurses who are training
them for Life’s Handicap.
Major H. D. Iv. Macartney, who took a
leading part in getting the first squadron of
the A.F.C. into shape, has managed a trip
to London. A few of the luckier or more
promising young pilots of the squadron have
also been sent to England to elaborate their
education. On the other hand, several Aus-
tralian undergrads, of British universities,
having attained their wings in the R.F.C.,
have been transferred to the A.F.C., and are
now with the rest of the boys in Egypt.
Major Mac is a grandson of the best-remem-
bered Dean of Melbourne since the time of
Dr. Bromby. A few short years ago he was
one of a little bunch of lieutenants attached
to the R.A.A. at Port Phillip Heads —a cob-
ber of Cyril White, now General White,
D.S.O.
A fellow-passenger assures me that the
gushers of the daily press are very wrong—
Hughes was not “the life and spul of the
ship” he came home in. But Little Billy’s
newspaper popularity has now reached such
a pitch that he would be described as the
life and soul of an atheist’s funeral if a
reporter detected him at any such outing.
Star members of the big touring music
show were engaged in their native land
at bargain rates. The high cost of living
in Australia, side by side with the fat mana-
gerial profits, so upset the singers that they
developed a fearful cold until the salary list
was revised. It has been a dreadful winter
for colds.
The singing Italians were fed to bursting
point during their last week, and made no
resistance. The Emmertons gave a great
dinner one night; Mrs. Charlie Fairbairns
arranged the menu next evening; and the
Tom Hogans fairly rained lunch and sup-
per parties. As for the Dalrymples—they
turned their home into an Italian
restaurant, but without a cash register at
the door. Mrs. Ilidgecock gave a Vienna
party. The young daughter who is small,
fair and fluffy burnt incense before some of
the handsome Italian young men till the
black eyes of the Italian women started to
give small fireworks displays. The same
sort of thing was going on at all the parties,
and the worshipful gents, were doing their
best to avoid trouble and keep the teacups
unruffled.
Tenor Tino Cappelli had his farewell on
Wednesday night, and the house was
crammed to the doors. the bare-backed
boxers huddled together like trucked sheep
in their effort to crowd in deserving friends
who had not booked in time. After singing
his way through “Trovatore” in silver
armor and a white cloak, the star made a
second appearance as a concert singer after
the last “Trovatore” curtain. The un-
motored gallantly lost their last trams and
forked out taxi-hire in their eagerness to
hear him. In a drawing-room setting and
garbed in ordinary evenina-dress he looked
remarkably like Ivennerley Rumford shorn of
a few inches.
Rigaud, Melba’s Covent Garden stage-
manager, is living the simple life in Aus-
tralia at present. He stays at Coombe Cot-
tage, and potters about the grounds. Melba
is one of those enthusiastic gardeners who
get up at six in the morning to weed and go
out with an electric torch to audit the snails
at night. Rigaud’s specialty is making fire-
escapes for climbing roses. Pianist St.
Leger, who has just departed with a hospital
unit, stayed at Coombe, too, and Melba kept
him busy digging garden trenches—just to
prepare him for toil in the field.
The Conservatorium people here live in
dread of Melba. She turns up ere the lark
has risen (does the lark rise before nine
o’clock?), and Fritz Hart has to be right
there on the mat or be spoken to like a
second trombone. It is rumored that
the Government House people rush to
and fro when Nellie (an honored
guest) drives up to the door with her boxes.
The energetic woman considers 7.30 really
late for breakfast, and says so in a high,
clear voice.
Mrs. George Marlow stage managed a long-
tea table in the Vienna on Friday and had
crowds of her friends in to help clear it.
She is off to Sydney this week with her
husband. He, having sold out of all his
theatrical ventures, is now a man of leisure
and bound for a good long holiday. Mrs.
George, radiant in a fine complexion and a
smart coat-dress of pla'd, said that the opera
company had provided them with a grand
managerial finale. Miss Gonsalez and Mr.
Carpi were guests. Carpi is a bright young
man who has learnt the Australian language
and can pay nice compliments in it. He
says he has never struck so musical a place
as Melbourne —outside Italy. Miss Gonsalez,
wearing a big Gainsborough-feathered hat, did
most of her talking with her bright eyes.
I hear that Ben Fuller, having bought
the Princess’s from Marlow, is going to
"do it up” in red plush for revues and bel-
lowdramas. The Princess’s in its best days
was dedicated to the legitimate drama and
pastel tones. Even in its rough-and-tumble
later years it always wore the faded genteel
look of the cultured lavender-and-lace c'd
maid. Red plush will finish all that.
Katharine Prichard, who has been on the
parental perch at Armadale for some time,
thinking out plots for a dozen new novels,
packed up her billy and toothbrush the other
day and flew northward to renew acquaint-
ance with life on N. S. Wales opal
fields. Later on she is going into
the Outbackness of Eastern Gippsland.
where the roads are like earthquakes
and the inhabitants spend half their
time in cursing the Government and the rest
in growing immense crops of whiskers, etc.
Presently the results of industrious Katha-
rine’s investigations will be embalmed in
romantic print, whiskers and curses and all.
Clytie Coffey has taken over the Dudley
Library in Broothorn Buildings. It is one
of those handy-sized, personally-conducted
libraries where Constant Reader can rely
on getting the sort of book she likes to eat.
instead of being fobbed off with any old sand-
wich full of the wrong words.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
“Warre”: The most prevalent wheat rust
is that known as “leaf-rust,” blit I have found it
rather a benefit than otherwise in the Riverina in
cheeking a too luxuriant leaf-growth, which would
prove detrimental to a large yield of grain. 'P. gram-
inis, the grain-rust, is mostly associated with atmo-
spheric humidity, which is not a prevailing con-
dition in Riverina, but makes wheat-growing a
risky business on the coastal districts. Growing
early maturing wheats and using a well-balanced
soil-fertiliser are the two best preventives. The too
liberal use of nitrogenous manures in a wet district
makes wheat-rust a dead certainty. But Govern-
ment rust is the worst trouble the Riverina cocky
has struck yet.

♦“Ess”: The vast reed beds near the junc-
tion of the Lachlan and Murrumbidgee rivers,
which impeded explorer Oxley and led him to
form the erroneous opinion that the centre of the
continent was a great inland sea, are, or were,
inhabited by hordes of wild pigs, snakes and rab-
bits, and the hundred channels of the Lachlan are
the haunt of myriads of waterfowl. The reedbed
pig, a wiry, shaggy-looking, pugnacious animal,
set on long legs, feeds on them all promiscuously,
mingling his diet with fish, bogged cattle, cum-
bungee reeds, and lamb cutlets. Landowners war
with the porkers, travellers and settlers kill them
for food, and others hunt them for sport, but they
are not easy to dislodge. A butcher in Hay once
employed three men with dogs to capture reedbed
porkers. The dogs’ part was to bail up the pig;
then it was lassoed and carted to a yard, where
it was fed on pollard. Over a hundred were caught
in this way in about three weeks. They were taken
in waggons to llay, a journey of 50 miles, fattened
and slaughtered. When killed fresh from the swamp
the pork was rank, but after the change of menu
it was quite as good as that of the respectable
NO NEED TO WAIT.
THE SLOW WAITER: “If looks as though the
rain will he coming along soon, sir.”
THE TIRED DINNER: “I ordered chop , not
soup !”
member of the family. On the Lower Macquarie
pig-scalping used to be very common. Nearly 2000
scalps were paid for in one year on Buttabone alone,
and on Buckinguy scalpers made good pay at a
shilling a snout. The pigs were clubbed, shot or
poisoned with phosphorus, the last-mentioned means
being largely used to thin out the hordes on Butta-
bone. Billjim also got some practice in charging
with the bayonet and lance—a shear-blade fastened
to the end of a long stick.
“A. Jimmie”: The Irish in Australia
learned something about pig-raising from their
grandmothers. Wherefore when the ould sow de-
livers her family a light is put within her residence
for the first four or five nights. A neighbor of mine
had a ma pig that with a light brought her first
family of .seven black-skins safely through, while
my beast Without a light and with a mixed lot of
blacks and whites crushed five of the blacks.
* * * *
“Lagani-Namo”: Perhaps it is well that
husbands generally do not possess a bird tout, as
did my Papuan friend Oboro, to fly to them
wherever they might be with full particulars of
any skittishness indulged in by their wives. Oboro
would have been much more useful to me had he
not had such a many, (bird) ; for too frequently
when I wanted him the other boys would inform
me that “maim belong Oboro just now he bin come.”
And there would be Oboro leaping about with bulg-
ing eyes and slavering mouth surrounded by other
natives who were keeping him at a safe distance
with spears. For minutes at a stretch he’d stare
dementedly aloft, listening to the revelations of
that spirit bird, breaking the spell occasionally to
seize an onlooker and scratch him like a gorilla.
Sometimes the audience got so badly mauled that
it would leap on the enraged party in a heap and
lash him to a tree. The last I saw of Oboro he
was suspended from a stout bamboo and being
taken to the diboorarooma (gaol) for trying to
hang himself under my stairway. I don't know why
he was interfered with.
» * * *
“Southern Cross” : To save a friend from
ruin I showed “Nick Bottom’s” warning against
milking-machines to R. Shepherd, of Bomaderry,
South Coast (N.S.W.). He is president of the
Dairy Farmers’ Ass., one of the biggest men in
the cow-juice game, and has been using the machines
tor six years. “Rats!” he said. “Milking pumps
are the last word in dairying. I would not part
with them.”
* * * *
“Barcoo”: Within the watershed of the
Gulf of Carpentaria horses suffer from a peculiar
disease when the grass is greenest and most luxuri-
ant. The sufferers will suddenly tire, sweat pro-
fusely, lop the ears, and look most dejected. It's
useless to keep them saddled up, and even if only
driven slowly they lose condition in a few days.
The disease is locally called the “puffs” owing to
the distress with which the afflicted animal
gets breath. Overlanders have many and various
explanations of the ailment, but I have never heard
any cure advocated except complete rest. After an
attack, it’s good-bye to all interest in the round-up
for six months.
* * * *
“Hay”: How many Abo.-writers have met
the “black scrubber,” the champion fighter amongst
’roos? I have seen him only in the south-east corner
of N. S. Wales, and from there to a point about 90
miles north of the
Murray. He is tne
biggest member of the
family, quite a dis-
tinct variety, and cer-
tainly the most pug-
nacious. He inhabits
the scrubby country,
and is rarely seen in
the open. When hunted
he shows no fear of
dogs, but will face
round and take the
offensive as if ha
rather enjoyed the
game. Once with a
mate I tackled one.
He was a big fellow,
and when he stood up
ip a sparring attitude
looked about 9ft. high.
After the dogs had re-
ceived a few clawings
they refused to shake
hands with him. So
we charged at him with
sticks, one on each
side. He made no
attempt to run, but
faced the barbarity till
the finish with the
greatest pluck, manag-
ing to get one scratch
home on the back of
my mate’s saddle that
spoilt its appearance,
the leather being torn
right through. This
kind of ’roo is nearly
black and quite unlike the red-brown variety. He
is armed with claws much longer than those of the
ordinary kang. The centre toenail of his hind feet
is like a piece of polished steel, and is often five
inches long.
* * * *
“Try Fluke”: I am with old-hand mis-
sionary Brown of Australia and Kanaka Land in the
opinion that the cannibal is often a first-chop bloke,
so to say, with the manners of a gen’leman. Some of
the finest old Maori rangatiras I have known were
man-eaters in their warpath days, and one of them
at least, Araki te Pohu, of the Arawa country,
defended the pastime. Speaking of his feasts on man-
meat: “It was like pork when it was cooked,’’ he
said, “but far sweeter. Your pakeha beef and mutton
— hu! they are not fit to eat beside the meat of man
—above all, a nice fat slave girl!” But lady-helps
are too scarce now for that sort of thing!
A QUESTION OF COLOR.
“Hulloa, Jacky, not enlisted yet!”
“Yes, Boss! Tried to join Light Horse, but plurry sergeant turn me down. Him say:
‘You too plurry dark for Light Horse ’ — he, he!”
“Ped” : The harvesting season before last,
while the adjoining cockies failed to grow one single
blade of crop, a farmer near ltutherglen (Vic.) har-
vested about 20 acres of wheat which went five bags
to the acre. This is how he managed it. After
the first (and only) shower he ran the harrows over
the paddock several times to kill the thistles. It
wasn’t long before he noticed that his wheat was
coming up, and, being a cocky with a little more
than the ordinary intellect, he examined the soil,
which he found to be quite moist. He kept on
with the harrowing until the top soil was as fine
as" dust. The crop grew to a height of only about 2ft.,
but the grain was full and quite as good as that
of the previous year. This proves that it’s possible
to have a decent crop during a drought, provided,
of course, there, is a first rain at the right time.
* * * *
“Lagani-Namo”: When the pioneer mis-
sionaries reached New Guinea they decided to con-
duct their proselytising at a profit; so their mis-
sionary stations became trading depots. One Bible-
banger persuaded his flock to bring him much copra,
promising that Jesus Christ would pay them tenfold
in the by-and-bye. Months passed, and those natives
came to the conclusion that they had been robbed.
So one evening a big flotilla of canoes floated into
Samarai, and hundreds of jabbering niggers rushed
the magistrate: “Taubada [master], you savvy one
fella missionary belong me feller?” “Yes, my
boys.” “You savvy boss belong him, nama Jesu
Chris?” “Yes.” “Huh! taubada, missionary he bin
catchem plenty feller copra belong we feller; he
talk all-a-time, by-’n’-bye boss belong him, nama Jesu
Chris, come behind pay. Six feller moon he been
come finish, that feller he no come; more better
you puttim him in deviliroorna [gaol].” The
magistrate explained. “Looka here, boy, this feller
Jesu Chris he big feller Chief alonga Heaven. By-
’n’-bye you feller die. S’pose you good feller boy
He tak you live along - this feller village belong Him.
That feller village he No. 1 place, he gottem plenty
every things; s’pose boy he wantem something he
gettem quick feller.” “You savvy that feller vil-

that they could collect for that copra. Ever since
then trading has been on a C.O.D. basis.
“A.J.8.”: Try these few records in one
of our greatest industries. “O'Shea” Osborne, at
Aberdeen (N.S.W.), killed and dressed 140 full-
woolled ewes for export in eight hours; at Waitara
(M.L.) 145 big crossbred wethers in seven hours;
at Aberdeen, 200 preservers in eight hours; and at
Barcaldine (Q.), 250 “potters’’ in hours. But
in my opinion his best performance was 168 lambs
at Anderson’s Flemington Meat Works (.Vic.) in a
little over eight hours. 1-Ie had at that time been
away from the trade for a number of- years. During
the last three hours he could just hold the skin, and
the perspiration dripped off him. Yet all his freezers
were surgeoned in an incomparable manner. “Big

but the job took almost the round of the clock.
Jack Craddock, at Angliss’s (Vic.), killed and
dressed 197 lambs and ewes in eight hours and 20
minutes. Bill Minns sent along 203 lambs in the
same time at the same place and “Budge McFarlane,
also same time and place, accommodated 197 lambs;
but there was no comparison between these freezers
and those of Osborne’s days. I honestly believe
“O’Shea” Osborne was the best mutton slaughterman
the world ever touched its hat to.

“Copabella”: The Argus and one of its
country correspondents became quite excited the
other day about the deception practised on a ma
sheep by the disguising of a strange lamb in the
overcoat of the mother’s own dead offspring. It
was an ancient confidence trick when I was a lad
in Worcestershire (Eng.) ever so long ago. A
sheep is worth about a fiver there, so lambing time is
a serious event in the farmer’s life. The little flocks
of mas were put in barns, and the shepherd, aided
by hot gin, unguents and a good fire, acted as
physician-accoucher. Lambs were swathed in blankets
on arrival and a stock of feeding-bottles was
carefully laid in. Some weak lambs I have even
seen staggering along beside their mothers with
their groggy legs supported in splints! Two or
three lambs per birth was usual, and when the cruel
cold beat all the farmer’s skill the old “mothering”
dodge was used. You’d have to rattle the bones of
history pretty hard to find the shepherd who
thought of it first.

“Badger”: Flannagan had an aching
tooth and a mortal dread of dentists. “Pull it
yourself” was the-advice of a pedlar who had just
sold Flannagan a tin pannikin and a leather belt.
“How the blanky can I?” retorted Flannagan. “I’m
no dentist.” “Easy enough; put a piece of twine
round it ’n’ tie that seven-pound weight on the
other end. Let ’er drop with a jerk an’ out- she
comes.” Flannagan was not impressed, but late that
night the grinder behaved so badly that he went
out on his bare feet to try his hand at dentistry.
After securing the string the sufferer screwed up
his courage, held his head back and let go. The
String parted in the middle, and next morning the
doctor didn’t know which of Flannagan’s two broken
toes to attend to first.

“Y.Z.”: Ab-originals have lately set them-
selves to instruct chicken culturists how to induce
hens to spread themselves and break the record. I
hope Quince; of Peterfield, reads The Bulletin ; I
trust he is a better poultry farmer for it. When I
first visited Quince’s farm in my capacity as valuer
for a Melbourne money-lender, I found Quince stand-
ing before a, long terrace of homes for working hens.
He was altering the figures on a blackboard stuck
up as a public notice. The proclamation as revised
read:—
Monday .. 200 hens, 11 eggs.
Tuesday .. ~ „ 7 „
Wednesday. „ ~ 9 ~
Total .. 200 hens, 27 eggs.
“What does it mean?” I asked. “They’ll know
wellernough! ” snorted Quince. Presently Mr.
Quince, who was a vicious little sandy blackguard,
condescended to explain. It appeared that this was
the off-season for eggs, and Quince’s 200 hens had
turned out only 27 eggs in three days. Quince
rapped the blackboard with his knuckles. “I’ll
shame the cows! ” he said. When I next called
’upon Quince he was busy decapitating a black
pullet which he hung up by the legs under his
notice-board whereon was set forth even a more
shameful record than before. This was the second
victim. Two headless hens hung bleeding. “Let’s
see if that’ll encourage ’em!” growled Quince. I
met Quince, the eggomaniac, in town some days
later. “It worked orright,” he chuckled. “I

QUITE SAFE.
GUEST (at country pub): I ah—left my hoots outside my door last night, and they
are there yet.”
MRS. PUBLICOUSE (pleased): “Lor’ bless yer, sir, yes—yer could ha’ left yer purse
there, too. We’re honest people here, thank Heaven!”
“Corio”: The talk had been of rapid
growth in crops when somebody claimed a record.
On William Mackenzie’s farm at Wollongong
(N.S.W.), he said, a crop of amber cane had been
garnered when but four months in stalk. Even
then it had climbed the tape to 14 ft. I may say
that there’s nothing known against the narrator
except that he is of Welsh descent.
* * * »
“Snell” : Old Mrs. Weebold was listening
to the one-legged soldier’s story of German devil-
ment —how the Hun’s big guns mowed things down,
and blew things up, and spread death and disorder,
lie grew more specific with a yarn of a peaceful
homestead smiling between two hills, vine-clad
and gemmed with innumerable blooms, which was
suddenly caught in a gust of great gun-fire, smashed
into hopeless wreckage, blackened and blasted out
of all recognition. “When we got to it,” said
Khaki, “there wasn’t a whole brick; there wasn’t
a splinter of wood bigger than my hand. Yet the
people could only have deserted the place that day,
for a shell had struck the dairy, and the ruins were
sloppy with milk and fresh cream.” Then old Mis.
Weebold threw up her arms in anguish. “They
spilt the milk?” she cried. “Y’ don’t mean to say
they spilt the milk!”
* * * *
“Bad Australian”: Here’s the biggest bag
of native bears made by one man in one hour.
(Perhaps you wouldn’t call him a man with that
crime on his soul, but there were extenuating cir-
cumstances.) We were a survey party, the little
crowd who cut the track from Talong Swamp to the
Wombat (Vic.). It was a miserably cold winter
even for the Tableland, and we were weather-bound
on a small, wet grassy oasis in a dense forest.
Almost every swamp gum had a bear or two roost-
ing contentedly in its branches, so one Sunday after-
noon old Bill, our “poisoner,” who was very short
of nap, reached his Martini down and without
moving from the tent door shot the materials for a
serviceable rug in 53 minutes by the galley clock.
In that space of time he had reduced the ancestors
of Norman Lindsay’s pals by 30. Old Bill was
very pleased with his bag, but when he found that
all hands were not willing to lighten the labor
of flaying the innocents he was the maddest man
in the mountains. You know what kind of a con-
tract it is to skin one native bear. But Bill wasn’t
a quitter, so he put in his spare time for the next
four days yanking the pelts off his collection and
letting the damper and the salt horse go N to blazes.
“Hay”: Although he will roast and eat a
snake occasionally Binghi isn’t too keen on the
“toro” as an article of diet. He much prefers a
good big iguana, or, as he calls it, a “purna.” This
is his favorite among lizards and is both meaty and
oily. Next in favor is the “c-arni,” or frill-necked
lizard. The blue-tongued or stumpy-tailed lizard
is not thought much of as food, being merely a
shell. But as an egglayer Binghi prizes the
beast highly, and indeed it is a marvel. I’ve
seen Mrs. Binghi scratch out between 30 and 40
eggs from one of its burrows. They are just like
small white potatoes. When roasted in the ashes
theyfare considered a great delicacy. I don’t know
whether it is on account of its egg-laying ability,
but Binghi’s name for the emu is much the same,
being “culti.” There is one kind of lizard in
Centralia -that Binghi will have nothing whatever
t'> do with and expresses the utmost disgust at the
mere sight of. This is the “weelitcha” or barking
lizard. It is about six inches long, of a dark
grey leaden color, and is found under the loose
skin of dead timber. When disturbed or annoyed
i.i any way it keeps up a little yapping, or, rather,
squeaking sound. I can’t say whether the reptile
is venomous, but he looks ugly enough for anything.
“Te Babarantiko”: The deliberate ampu-
tation mentioned by “S.” (B. 6/7/T6) is fairly com-
mon in much higher forms of life than the tarantula.
I had bought a large coeoanut crab from a native
and told him to tether the freak somewhere. He
did, to a palm. After a while I went out to inter-
view the robber. He wasn’t there —at least, not all
of him. Only a leg and its murderous, armored
pincer claw dangled on the string. The crab had,
according to custom, torn the limb off, and had made
for the forest. I tracked him across the road and
found him backed in between two forking roots of
a jackfruit tree with his remaining claw raised in
defence. A few minutes later he was sizzling on the
fire.
* * * *
“McNorth”: Thursday Island runs in all
shapes. Jap divers clatter past in the curious
wooden shoes of their country—simply flat pieces of
wood with a crossed band for the toes. Behind them
shuffles a Chinaman in flat mat-slippers. A half-
caste girl carrying a pink parasol goes past bare-
foo.ted. A pair of blucher boots with two thin black
legs sticking straight up out of them without touch-
ing the sides heave in sight. They belong to a main-
land Binghi from one of the bSche-de-mer boats. Two
pairs of unclothed, but rather neat, feet from Malaya
step briskly by, and a dozen spreadeagled, greasy
black toes drift past uncertainly as their Iviwai
owners from the Fly River discuss where they’ll go
next. Then approach a pair of large, black feet
that look like oyerdone lumps of roast pork. Several
. well-corned toes protrude at various angles, and have
the appearance of being stuck on temporarily. The
pedals advance deliberately majestically. The
owner is an indolent, obese Torres Strait Islander,
and he tells me that he is in town seeking Govern-
ment relief on account of the failure of the yam crop
in his Island. I advised him that a quicker way was
to raffle his feet.
* * * *
They look on the bright side of things in
the Tasmanian backblocks. Thus “our local corres-
pondent’’ recently: “We were very sad to hear of
the death of Lord Kitchener, but we were cheered
up when the workmen came up to build our new
church.”
* * * *
“Pick” : “Bareoo’s” cure for horse mange
(B. 10/8/’10) has the disadvantage of being avail-
able only in districts where the recommended in-
gredients, fig-leaves and butter-milk, grow. Mange
on either horses or dogs may, however, be eradicated
inside a month, in any locality, by the bush whacker
who is not too genteel to bathe the suffering four-
footer daily with urine.
*■**'*
“Karagi”: There is nothing extraordinary
in the statement that the boomerang is a Mexican
weapon. Elliott Smith has proved that civilisation
and the arts originated in Egypt and spread over a
wide area. Some Queensland aborigines embalmed
their dead, and a mummy in the Nicholson Museum
from one of the islands in the Gulf of Carpentaria
is cured with the same material as the ancient
Egyptians used. Smith —a Grafton youth, by the
way—also proved • that Mexican civilisation sprang
from the Egyptian. Professor Stirling did not dis-
cover boomerangs in Egypt and India. They were
known and had been written about before the Pro-
fessor was ever heard of. Why, the ancient Belgians
used them against Julius Caesar, who struck a coin
showing.the oldest inhabitant throwing one.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The big Australian mail came in,
And boys in all the trenches
Mere filled with hope and joy and fear
For news of home and wenches.
And one would read how drought had come
And dad had had his losses;
Another learn that Sis was wed
And mother had her crosses;
While Bogan boys and Longreach lads
Had tales of country races,
Of towns that couldn’t raise a smile
Because of absent faces.
My six-foot chum from Condamine
Went round and joked, delighted—
His girl had writ, and all his mates
Were more or less excited,
And mad and glad to grip their mail
Although it proved a bad one;
Some wept like girls to get their news,
And I—because I had none.

That makes it NECESSARY in ACUTE Cases.
One Dose of this Wonderful Remedy will very often prove

This co. is principally an undertaker. Just
before the Melbourne boom broke _in the
’9o ! s it had borrowed nearly a million and
a half and lent that and its own capital on
the security of properties whose value had
been inflated by the borrowing boom. These
securities were thrown on to its hands whole-
sale; and all the while the creditors were
barking for their money. The properties
were sold as fast as possible, and the differ-
ence between the price realised and the
money advanced was written off capital.
Finally the residue was valued and the ex-
pected loss was written off the capital that
remained. Thus the £5 ordinary shares
were reduced to Is. But in this operation
it was provided that, if the writing down
was too severe, the surplus realiseu should
go to a special reserve for the benefit of the
ordinary shares and of certain deferred
pref. shares. There have been pretty large
surpluses; and they have piled up to
£108,524. But the following indicates that
there is now very little property left to sell:

“House property and land, £39,727”; and
there isn’t likely to be much profit in that,
though the directors believe that there is
still some. The co. has been struggling to
get new business, but has had little luck,
apparently. It could give good security for
a quarter of a million of deposits; but it
holds only about £BO,OOO, and seems to have
no keen demand for even that much. Pro-
fits reckoned on capital and reserves are
therefore pretty poor. A 15 p.c. div. looks
all right; but actually capital and reserves
are not earning 4J p.c.

Now this was a case of the personal equa-
tion. The prospectus, judged without re-
gard to the people whose names were on it.
was a rather cheeky one. All that it told
you was the net profit for the one single
year prior to its issue: “The net profit for
i9OB, after making ample provision for de-
preciation, repairs, replacements, etc.,
amounted to £10,943.” The Sargent family
asked £45,000 for the goodwill of a business
about which they told very little more than
this. Too often it has happened that the
goodwill of a business sold to a co. has con-
sisted almost exclusively of the services of
two or three men who were selling out
simply in order to retire. In such cases the
public has paid large sums for something
it hasn’t bought. In this case, however, the
people who had made the business promised
that “no effort will be spared on the part of
the managers to ensure for the new co. a
greater measure of success than has hither-
to attended their labors.” Seven years’ ex-
perience has proved that this was more than
the usual fair-weather talk of the co. pro-
moter. To-day there are reserves exceeding
the amount of the goodwill; so, discarding
this hypothetical property altogether, there
are now assets exceeding the whole of the
capital. Not what you would call very
liquid assets, certainly; but —well, here is
the whole position :
Freeholds .. .. £69,900
Leaseholds .. .. .. 19,000
Furniture and Plant .. .. 56,205
Cash 11,286
Stock, etc 23,964
£180,355
Less liabilities .. 53,743
£126,612
This amount is made up in this way:—
Capital .. .. ..£106,250
Calls paid in advance .. 4,999
Reserves as above .. 10,051
Half-year’s dividend .. .. 5,312
£126,612
All things considered, profits have been
wonderfully well maintained; and it seems
to be the sort of business which might make
good profits even out of dull times, simply
because it caters for the lean pocket that
wants a pie as well as for the fat one which
wants three-and-sixpence worth.

“Cam”: Anyhow, we can make jewel cases.
Previous to the explosion in Europe, most of,
if not all, the jewellery firms in Australia
were getting their cases from Austria and
Germany. But never again. A couple of
years ago Thos. Duff and Bros., of Mel-
bourne, started manufacturing jewel boxes
on a large scale, and are now 7 turning them
out as good as any that ever came from
the Squareheads, and supplying them in
large quantities to all the principal houses
in the Commonwealth.

“Sneezer” : If you are a lonely bushie like
myself, short of amusement and correspond-
ence, write to one of these pathetic adver-
tisers for a keg of corn cure or whatever he
happens to be selling. You will never be
lonely or dull afterwards. When catarrh was
worrying me I wrote to a loud quack who
was advertising his “cure,” and received for
my florin a small phial of inhalant and a
letter urging me to send without delay for a
two-months’ supply, price 80s. Cure guaran-
teed or money refunded: alternatively two
months’ extra supply free. Enclosed was a
long list of questions to answer with order
form and an addressed envelope; also a form
to fill in with the names and addresses of
three other sufferers whom I might know.
Absolute secrecy guaranteed, of course. I
used the prayerful letter for pipelights and
decided to try to cure myself. After a few
weeks I got another letter expressing surprise
and great regret that I had not taken advan-
tage of the first wonderful offer. Then I
was urged to buy the cure for 15s.
Having already half-cured myself with a
simple prescription, I sat back and watched
the quack’s second offer curl up in the fire.
Eight weeks later arrived a more-in-sorrow-
than-in-anger missive. The cure was mine
for 10s., and if I didn’t accept my benefactor
would go away and drown himself. As I
was afraid he mightn’t do it, I pushed him
towards his doom by sending him my cure:
Dissolve salt, soda and powdered borax in
hot water and use for gargling and inhaling.
I’ve had no more offers since and want none.
But it was great fun while it lasted.

THE CLOTHES FAMINE.
[For Thh Bulletin.]
In spite of the law reducing the width of skirts,
the shortage of dress material in Germany continues.
The situation is becoming serious.— Cable.
Hunland may yet like Eden he,
Its rulers dressed from neck to knee
In nought but brief authority;
While one within a palace room
Sits shiv’ring merely wrapped in gloom!
To women ’twill be most unkind;
Though Love’s notoriously blind,
Young Hansel very soon may find
That Gretel is a sad illusion
When covered only with confusion!

“T. 0.1.”: When the Brighton (just sold
for a hulk) joined the Manly ferry fleet in
1.883; that fleet consisted of the Fairlight
(since broken up), the Emu (in her old
age named the Brightside) and the Royal
Alfred. The fare was one-and-six return.

“Wellyn Llewellyn” : A unique occurrence
—in Northern Victoria, at least —was the
harvesting of a wheat crop in the middle of
May, the month of general sowing. The
crop belonged to J. 11. Peverill, of Charlton,
and was grown on his farm at Glenloth.
Over the fence from w r here his harvesters
were working the neighbor was drilling in
his next season’s crop. The field was sown
at the ordinary cropping period last year,
on land that had previously been badly
infested with thistles. Having had very
little rain previous to sowing the thistle
seeds lay dormant until with good rains they
and the wheat came up together. And
when harvest time came the pride of bonnie
Scotland presented a problem indeed. The
binder was introduced, but the thistles
proved too formidable. The ordinary har-
vester with its choke-cutter attachment can
cope with a moderately dirty crop, but was
altogether inadequate for the difficulties
presented in this instance. The field was
then abandoned, but eventually a neighbor
offered to try his skill and a special machine
on the puzzle. He cleared the 140 acres,
the yield being very fat in the circumstances
—three bags per acre. The sample was also
good, considering.
* * * *
“Toki”: Maoriland is now 7 growing some-
thing to smoke. The plucky little New
Zealand Tobacco Co. has just put its first
consignments on the market. It has 25
acres of sunny land at Clive (Hawkes Bay)
and is urging the farmer thereabouts to put
in the new crop. Meanwhile it expects to
grow enough for its own needs. It has a
factory in Napier and i£ turning out several
different brands, the tins, wrappings, labels,
etc., all made locally. The wowser only
knows why; but instead of giving the new
industry a bonus the Government collects
one shilling a pound on the co.’s product.
* * * *
“E.C.D.”: “Fru” (B. 27/7/’l6) is not up-
to-date in his knowledge of the “everlasting
fern” industry. It is true that before the
war the dried vegetation was despatched to
Germany for treatment, one of the largest
exporters of the raw material being Browne
and Son, of Woy Woy (N.S.W.), who em-
ployed collectors in nearly every State.
Although hit hard by the war, the local men
succeeded in evolving a process of preserva-
tion and dyeing which enables them to pro-
duce an article equal in every way to that
marketed by the Hun. To-day practically
all the “everlasting fern” exported is manu-
factured at Woy Woy, and more would go
were shipping space available. Yankee-land
is the best market.

The ready-to-wear ship, as distinct from
the made-to-order variety, has arrived. An
American firm has filled the want; but
British shipyards are preparing to follow.
The parts are standardised and made in lots,
and only want assembling as the orders came
in, each ship being, of course, built on a
stock plan. The manager of the Common-
wealth Naval Dockyards doesn’t see any
immediate prospects of “stock” work in Aus-
tralia; but the new trade is only beginning.
* * * *
“8.D.”: After the war began bundles of
fluff-goods that used to have the “Made
in Germany” label on them in big
letters were pushed across the counter as
“Made in Australia.” This seemed suspicious,
but inquiry showed that the things really
were made in Australia and always had
been, but that before the war they used to
put up the sign of the Swine to attract
people who didn’t want mere Australian
goods. The Lord forgive them!
* * * *
“Matelot”: Coming into Capetown the
other day I saw a low-lying, snaky old
clipper ship at the pier dismasted. She
was so sharp that I took a stroll around to
have a look at her. The Portuguese flag
was fluttering aloft, and on the stern was
“Fereira, Lisbon.” But when I had chummed
up with the skipper I found she was none
other than the famous old Aberdeen clipper
Cutty Sark. She had been thrown on her
beam ends through her cargo shifting when
off the Cape, and they had cut away her
mainmast and mizzen-topmast to right her,
and under jury rig had managed to work
her in. Her old bell, ‘inscribed “Cutty
Sark, 1870,” is hung in the saloon, and was
shown by her skipper, who was very
proud of the old ship. She still has a turn
for speed. I was shown her log of a
recent passage from Lisbon to Pernambuco
in 22 days, and the “old man” told with
much gesticulation how he had passed a
French mailboat going 14 knots. Her log
showed frequent runs of 12 to 14 knots. The
poor old hooker is a wreck now, of course,
with bulwarks and boats gone, and the only
white man in her crew is the boss; but they
are re-rigging her as a barquentine to gather
in a few more dividends before she goes out
for good.
* * * *
“Ojo” suggests a reform: —
The Australian and M.L. system of tram fares is
all wrong. This is a good sweeping assertion to
start with, and clears the way nicely. If in Sydney
I want to go from the Quay to the Railway Station,
I can travel the whole way for one penny. But if
I want to go from a point two blocks on one side of
the station to a point two blocks on the other side,
I must pay twopence, just because it happens that
the end of the section comes there, although my
total distance in this case is very much less than I
can travel for one penny, provided I keep inside
the sections. Now for the remedy. Divide the
route into sections of 20 blocks, starting a new
one at every five blocks along the way. Then if I
get into a tram anywhere between streets 1 and 5,
I can travel to street 20; if I get in between 5 and
10, I can travel to street 25, etc. I already hear
the roar that the system is too complicated. But it
has been in actual use in London for years, only it
is much 'more complicated there, because of the
halfpenny fares. And perhaps even a patriotic
Australian or Maorilander will admit that there is
more traffic along some of the London routes than
even in Sydney or Auckland.
* * * *
The Japanese seem to have a broad
streak of originality where high explosives
are concerned. After the Russo-Jap War
dear old Constant Reader had to listen to
wonderful stories of the ruin wrought by
“shimose” powder. Lately the cables told
how the Russian general Brussiloff had been
blasting the Austrians back to the Carpa-
thians with shells “charged with a new
Japanese explosive which has surpassed all
expectations.” A compound that can shock
the experts in these times must be almost
powerful enough to shake the stars out of
their settings in the sky.
* * * *
Charles F. Emerson, of Los Angeles
(U.S.A.), guesses there isn’t any reason
why Australia shouldn’t make its own wash-
ing soda, and he’s come over to see about
starting up a plant. It seems as if people
have made up their minds that we shall not
conserve our great natural resources by
importing things instead of using up our
own raw material.
BAD FOR THE TRADE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Young Moses did a splendid thing.
Before a train he ran,
And braving Death’s detested sting
He saved a threatened man.
Seizing Malone with vigor fine,
lie fairly hurled him off the line.
While scores congratulated Ike
On his heroic act,
And offered medals and the like,
His sire with rotten tact
Poured forth contempt upon his son,
And scoffed, too, at the thing he’d done.
An undertaker is • old Mo.
“Of course to go and save
Dot Irish feller’s life, I know,
Iss vot you fools call brave.

WHAT IS A QUID?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Justice Ueydon (N.S.W.) lias based his further
addition to the “living wage” upon the fact, which
is indisputable, that the pound note isn’t as valuable
is a pound note was.
It’s a quid and it isn’t a quid!
You get a grey rag for your wages,
Instead of the sovereign you formerly did.
It’s a quid! It’s a quid! Yet it isn’t a quid,
And it bothers you into red rages!
Oh, they call it a quid, but it’s not
A real quid you can bite with your molars;
And the statist gets out his dry-rot
Just to show how you’re under the rollers.
It’s a quid and it isn’t a quid!
It’s a pound and it isn’t a pound!
So you puzzle your head like a kid
On some wonderful merry-go-round.
It’s as simple as simple can be,
But from easier puzzles I’ve hid!
Will somebody find out the answer for me?
It’s a quid yet it isn’t a quid l

Beautiful Hair and lots of it—lf you use Crystolis.
Here’s good news at last for men and women whose
hair is falling, who are growing bald and grey,
whose scalps are covered with dandruff that nothing
seems to keep away, and whose heads itch like mad.
Good news even for those who imagine themselves
hopelessly and incurably bald, or who suffer from hair
or scalp trouble of any kind.
We have had granted to us the sole Australasian
rights for the great American discovery, Crystolis, the
new hair remedy that in America and Europe has
been called the most wonderful scalp discovery of
the century, having been awarded Gold Medals at
the big Paris and Brussels Expositions.
Hundreds of men and women have written us to tell
of the phenomenal results obtained by its use. People
who have been bald for years tell how they now glory
in their beautiful hair. Others who have had
dandruff all their lives say they have now a clean,
healthy scalp, and that hair stopped falling after a
few applications of this wonderful new treatment.
We don’t care whether you are bothered with fall-
ing hair; prematurely grey hair, matted hair, brittle
hair or stringy hair, dandruff, itching scalp or any
or all forms of hair trouble, we want you to try
“CRYSTOLIS” at our risk.
We give you a binding guarantee without any
“strings” or red-tape, that it won’t cost you a cent
if we do not prove to you that “Crystolis” will do
all we claim for it, and, what’s important, we have
plenty of money to back our guarantee. We have
deposited £2OO in our local bank as a special fund
to be forfeited if we fail to comply with this contract.

CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Harmless fruit laxative cleanses
stomach, liver and bowels
without griping or
discomfort.
An acid stomach, clogged with fermenting,
ill-digested food, means that the liver is not
doing its duty. Nature provided ripe fruit
juices to keep the liver up to. its work.
California Syrup of Figs—“Califig”—is a
deliciously refreshing fruit laxative which is
always in season. You can keep it at hand,
and it will be an unfailing friend whenever
the tongue is coated, bowels sluggish, breath
foul, throat dry or sore, stomach full of
wind, and head hot and aching. You can
take a dose whenever it is needed* as safeiy
as you could eat fresh fruit. In a short
while you will feel the benefit. The bowels
will be gently relieved, and the stomach
cleansed and sweetened as the undigested
food is moved on and got rid of. The tongue
will grow clean again and the head will be
cooled and cleared. There is no mistaking
the beneficial effects of California Syrup of
Figs—“Califig.” Directions are with it for
adults and children of all ages. This
pleasant laxative is good for all, and cannot
possibly harm even the most delicate, but
you must ask for “Califig”—California
Syrup of Figs, and look for the name and
trade-mark of the California Fig Syrup Co.
All chemists sell “Califig”—California
Syrup of Figs—in bottles of two sizes,
1/U and 1/9. U
POLITICAL
POINTS
THE TALKATIVE SPHINX.
Spite of protests, Kink O’Malley per-
sists in inviting competitive designs at once
for the Dryberra Parliamentary buildings.
Most of the younger generation of architects
in Australia, Britain, France, Russia (there
are some great Russian architects), Italy and
Belgium will not be able to compete, and a
good many of the older ones won’t feel
inclined to. But that does not worry the
Hair of All the Ages, for the absence of
these people will give a clear run to the
United ,states. A boundless faith in the
United States is O’Malley’s second most
prominent characteristic.
THE INTERNATIONAL BULLY.
London, August 14.— Because of “the inadequate
protests of Dutch traders against the British sea
blockade,” the German newspapers insist that “there
must be a limit to the forbearance exercised by our
Dutch neighbors, which presses more severely on the
Central Powers than upon Holland herself. If no
such limit is brought about, Germany may take
measures to relieve the situation, which has become
intolerable.”
THE H UN: “If he doesn't let me hare some-
thing to eat very soon, I’ll give you a
clout.”
Speaker Meagher having ruled that the
Bill giving women the right to stand for
election to the N. S. Wales Assembly was
“unconstitutional,” the Holman Government
bore the document away to the burning. It
was a joyous procession headed by a wink.
The “go slow” business calls for stern
discouragement, but it is no use condemning
it in the workers and ignoring it in the cap-
tains of industry. With them, of course, it
is called “restriction of output,” and there
arc not many lines in which it hasn’t been
practised at some time or other. Let the
virtuous make a note to talk to them, too,
just as plainly as they are talking now to
the I.W.W.
A new argument has just been heaved at
the Vic. Government to deter it from further
restricting pony racing. Some 800 cabbies,
with their horses, will, it is said, be preju-
diced by the proposal. Of course also no gaol
where there are no prisoners should be closed,
because the warders would be done out of a
job. And why not systematically smash
plate-glass windows to keep glaziers fully
employed ?
Adelaide Chamber of Commerce finds the
Federal Government’s attitude on enemy
trading “Gilbertian,” and says so. To
trade with the enemy is a criminal offence;
but, when a member wrote for a copy of the
black-listed firms, he was advised that the
document was “confidential and not for
issue to the public.” So are the names of
people who have, presumably for good rea-
sons, been interned. When the All-British
League in Adelaide asked for them lately,
it was told that publication was not
“desirable.” Which apparently means that
it is not desirable we should know who are
the German enemies in our midst lest we
should be disinclined to trade with them after
the war. So much for the sincerity and
thoroughness of this no-more-German-goods
yell raised by the Government!
When he was previously in office West-
ralia’s new Premier was known as “Rat-
catcher” Wilson. He will need all the old
qualities to keep some of the Country party,
on whom his majority depends.
The new Westralian Liberal Government
is poking into the darkest corners of its
predecessor’s pigeonholes; and the stirring
of the Powellising agreement papers has
created a particularly bad smell. One of
Scaddan’s Ministers arranged the matter
with the proprietors of the wliite-antidote,
with whom the Railways Commissioner
had a contract nearing
its end. Commissioner
Short was looking for
a renewal on better
terms, but the Minis-
ter cut in and made a
bargain whic h em-
braced the entire Gov-
ernment service. The
Paralysers wanted
among other things a
royalty of 9d. per 100
super, feet for the use
of their patent. The
Ministers advised
Cabinet to decline the
business unless the
right could be secured
for 6d. on the basis of
1,000,000 karri sleep-
ers ; but he later re-
commended the com-
pletion of a contract
and agreement with
the co. with “slight
alterations.” Cabinet
approved once more.
The Minister’s ideas
of “slight alterations”
may be gathered from
the fact that instead
of a royalty of 6d. he
agreed to pay 9d. He
contracted to use a
larger minimum of
sleepers annually ; in
default, to pay £3750
a year. And the con-
tract is to remain in
force until 1923—five
years, it is said, after
the co.’s rights in the
process have expired!
Some people say the
Powellisers are very
lucky. Others merely
take out their hankies.
There is no antiquated devotion to red
tape among the public officials in Fiji, any-
how. When a steamer arrived at Levuka
the other day with 20 sheep on board an
application was sent to the local Inspector
of Constabulary and Stock to come along-
and pass the animals
for landing. He was
sick in bed. But that
didn’t matter. The
Fruit Inspector put
them through.
The triumph of Cold
Tea at the Speck’s
liquor referendum,
besides making Bung
feel pretty sick, has
landed the Government
on very thin ice. A
big deputation of pub-
keepers, supported by
11 M’s.H.A., lately
waited on Premier Lee
to remind him that
some compensation
would do them good
when early closing-
starts. But as Lee
didn’t seem impressed
to any noticeable ex-
tent and wanted to
know what they were
squealing about, Bung
felt worse than ever.
Whitsitt (Indepen-
dent) and Burgess
(Importer) both spoke
in favor of compensa-
tion, and both—parti-
cularly Burgess—pro-
mised to mow down
the Government as
soon as the chance
occurs. Apparently
Labor will vote solidly
against the Govern-
ment on the Early-
closing Bill, and as
half a dozen Libs, are
standing in with the
Trade. Ministers are
wondering how far astern they will be when
the numbers go up.
Everybody pets the Socialist tiger nowa-
days. In the Speck’s Parliament the other
day Bob Sadler, a good, stodgy old Liberal,
told the .Government not to stop at the
hydro-electric scheme. There were othe,r in-
dustries it could establish without risk, such
as woollen mills and cement works. In short,
it can properly undertake any job—except
our job.
In Victoria a committee of the Assembly
is going to try to find out what makes people
leave the country and flock to the cities. The
chances are that it will produce some obscure
reasons instead of telling the plain truth —
(1) that people move in because they make,
as an average, twice as much money there
with half as much labor, and (2) that we
have got into the habit of assuming that any
old thing will do for the country—any old
railway carriage, for instance - L any old
clothes, any old furniture, any old office, any
old shanty, any old anything.
With regard to the Victorian German
schools, “the Ministerial and departmental
attitude has been that no suggestion of per-
secution of. the German school authorities
should be permitted.” Who wants to “per-
secute” them? Does Peacock talk of per-
secution when he finds that people are not
allowed to breed rattlesnakes in Collins-
street or store dynamite under Parliament
House? Every time the Premier exhorts
the manhood of Australia to go forth and
wage war against the Hun ideals he holds
himself up to reproof for not having promptly
suppressed local nurseries of the very Hun-
ism that he denounces as a danger to civilisa-
tion.
The Federal Government’s ukase that no
enemy goods may be sold wholesale after
September 80 or retail after November 30
means well but gets off the track. Such
Hun goods as are in the Commonwealth
have been paid for and the Germ has got
the cash. What is far more important now
is to conserve the cash we have left; and
we can only do that by effectively blocking
all imports that will injure Australian indus-
tries.
Following the chairman of the Austral
Hat Mills, who moaned the other day in Mel-
bourne over the excessive rate of wages and
the slowing-down policy, his fellow-director
Staughton advocated the “importation of
Oriental labor after the war.” Possibly;
but let us do the thing thoroughly. If, say,
a large landowner like Staughton fails to
work his land to its utmost capacity—if he,
in effect, "slows down” in the business of
cultivation —let us give him a month’s notice
to vacate the premises, and replace him by
an energetic Chow cabbage-manufacturer
who would toil seven days a week 18 hours
per day.
Universal Service is the. antidote to the
militarism which the Anti-Conscriptionists
make such a noise about. Militarism is pos-
sible only where there is a military caste;
but, where every available citizen is a
soldier, the military caste —being the whole
nation—can’t put on any class-swagger at
its own expense, or look down upon itself
as a beastly civilian.
THE ANTI-CONSCRIPTION ATTI-
TUDE.
AT THE TILLER: “Gome on, jump aboard;
that umbrella won't be any use to you if
the flood rises much more."
UP THE TREE: “No you, don't! I know your
game—you want to get me to take a turn
at the oars.”
A SONG OF SPRING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is the Spring. The season in me surging
Calls for a flight to nobler heights of song.
With spur of sun and whip of warm wind urging,
The yellow day drives me the world along.
Strike on the rebel strings the cold months muted
When influenza held me by the throat !
I am alive—leaf-green and deeply rooted—
I walk abroad without an overcoat.
Take hence the hollow shell whose cat-gut ringing
First at Apollo’s touch struck nations dumb !
I have a larger, louder song for singing
That needs the music of a four-foot drum.
Failing the drum, I seize an engine boiler,
And with a twelve-pound hammer smite it hard
To reach the ears of reiver and of spoiler,
And loose on them the passion of the bard.
Far in the North the conquering cannon thunder
The chorus of a splendid marching song.
The flying shells that tear the hills asunder
Shriek the glad notes of “Now we shan’t be long!’ 1
Something is doing. Heaven and earth are moving.
The long, stale years are buried with the dead.
The dullest eyes are wide with wonder, proving
That life is more than onions, board and bed.
Onward! At last it seems there’s something doing.
The dry bones rattle in a thousand vales.
The wine of a new spirit earth is brewing
Fills up the vats and overflows the pails.
Blood bought the change, but blood was worth the
spilling
To cleanse and purify the big new show ;
For, at the start of all the stoush and killing,
The old world died two dozen months ago.
Now we'll get down to business. Now we’ll muster
Against the wall the things that ought to die;
And something other, higher, holier, juster,
IVill lift our clean thought to a cleaner sky.
Now in the breast of every striving rebel
The pulses of new hopes begin to beat.
Bang on the boiler! ’Tis no piping treble
Should split the air when Muddle’s in defeat.
Now get an even beat; and let me mention,
Not without something that may sound a sob,
Labor takes off his coat with full intention
Of steady working at a steady job!
What’s this? The politicians dumb and quaking,
Close standing in their order, rank on rank!
The people’s mandate has been spoken, making
Each hustings hireling walk his platform’s plant
So we go forward. Bang upon the boiler !
The pansy opens to the touch of Spring.
Rich harvests, in the red track of the spoiler,
Have made the man who stands erect a king.
So runs the happy current of my dreaming.
So answers the warm torrent in my veins.
The march of Truth begins. The new world gleaming
Laughs in its cradle after childbirth’s pains!

A REMARKABLE FEAT
BY OXY-ACETYLENE
is demonstrated by the illustration, which shows how an old and worthless boiler, forty years
° j*6 e 8- D .d or enormous dimensions, was cut into small pieces and carried away from a
eon ned situation in the basement of a printing works. The whole work, conducted under
the most difficult of situations, was finished in two days. Without OXY-ACETYLENE
e work would have taken weeks, and the whole of the printing machinery and plant would
nave been idle and disorganised for weeks in excavation and dismantling work.
. EVERY ENGINEER and all interested should write in for free catalogues, giving

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Wonderful how out of hundreds of entries
the books are able to alight on a nag which should
be favorite, according to weights, months before a
big event is decided. When Caulfield Cup allotments
were made Charlie Horan’s black horse Lingle was
installed at the top of the betting list. Lingle was
always a good kind of and after being unlucky
in a couple of races succeeded in winning money at
Flemington and Caulfield with long intervals between.
Last Cup meeting of the V.R.C. Lingle ran a dead-
heat with Red Signal, but was unfortunate to lose.
Dempsey was on Lingle that day, and the horse
swerved off near the post but came again in time to
just reach the other prad which Joe Killorn was
driving along. Months later Lingle won at Caulfield.
On Saturday he had a run in the Dundas Handicap at
Rosehill and finished third. His condition may be
gauged from the fact that 33 to 1 was on offer. There
is plenty of time for a big change, though, between
now ancl Caulfield Cup day.
* * * *
George Meddick is one of the best light-
weights steering horses these days. Still an appren-
tice of Billy Kelso, the Randwick mentor, Meddick
is riding his full share of winners. At Rosehill on
Saturday he was astride two nags which reached the
judge before the others. Meddick first gained a name
when he won Melbourne Cup on Kingsburgh, trained
then, as now, by Isaac Foulsham for L- K. S. Mac-
kinnon, Woorak’s proprietor. That day Meddick out-
rode Wood, who was on Sir Alwynton, and did it
because he was in perfect condition. Sir Alwynton
had Kingsburgh aoparently beaten with 100yds. to
go. Wood momentarily sat up on the leader. That
gave Meddick —riding for his life —a chance to get
alongside. Sir Alwynton came again, but Kings-
burgh reached the post first by a little over a head.
By the way, Kingsburgh was favorite for the Carling-
ford Mile (Rosehill) on Saturday, and ended up
third. Heads separated him from the two outsiders
which finished in front. It is not improbable that
Kingsburgh may take a lot of silencing in the
Metropolitan.' He has to carry Bst. 71b.
Four horses trained by Harry Robinson,
of Randwick, have won races in the past couple of
weeks, and two others got close .up. On Saturday at
Rosehill, a pair of nags were produced by this stable
and both did the trick. Merrimee was liberated in the
Dundas Handicap, seven furlongs. Ike at first offered
five to two, but finding himself knocked down in
the rush shortened to six to four. The mare won
comfortably frorir Baronet Cooper’s imported Sydian.
This was Merrimee’s first win since the New Year’s
Gift at Randwick. It was her run in that event
which caused her to be backed down to 14 to one for
the last Newmarket, but she lost her punch in the
interval, started at 33 and ran according to price.
Merrimee carried 7st. 13lb. on Saturday. Her
Epsom burden is 31b. less. Robinson’s other winner
was Ready Aye Ready in the Maiden. This colt is
well named, being by Wallace from Australia. In his
day his brother S'unny South could hop: along as
fast as the next.
* * * *
About a year ago Lady Clarence, who un-
expectedly appropriated the Granville Stakes at
Rosehill on Saturday, was right in the boom.
At the A.J.C. Australia Day meeting the filly was
the cause of a wild rush to MacShortodds just
before the Nurses’ Handicap, a six-furlong dash
confined to two-year-olds. Ridden by McCabe, now
fretting under a compulsory rest, she started at
three to one and didn’t get a place. The event
went to Caleno, who has done nothing since. Lady
Clarence has always been trained by W. Booth, of
Rosehill, who is not philanthropist enough to feed
animals which cannot earn their living. It hap-
pens that the lady is a full sister to Oweenee and.
Firm, both of whom landed him races. She was
ridden on Saturday by the apprentice Crockett,
who has recently been developing a hobby for get-
ting home on outsiders.

When punters heard that Maoriland
owner Stead’s team of seven had arrived in Sydney in
charge of trainer Quinlivan they began to wonder if
they ought to look out for squalls. Certainly the
Maoriland invasion is very formidable this season.
One owner who came early is sitting back in a con-
tented frame of mind already. When a Stead advance
occurs the memory of a debacle which Australians
suffered at Randwick a few years ago is painful.
* * * *
Weighed in for the Final Handicap, Dan
O’Brien, one of the best-known racing men in
Maoriland and Australia. Dan first became associ-
ated with horses at the old Maribyrnong stud owned
by Hurtle Fisher, and in 1866 rode Fishhook
to victory in the Champagne Stakes at Rand-
wick. Increasing weight sent him aboard the
hurdlers; then he went to Maoriland, where he
put up a long record of success as an owner and
trainer. He settled down at Riccarton, near Christ-
church, and in ’B3 led Tasman in winner of the
first New Zealand Cup, after a sensational race with
a horse owned by “Ready Money” Robinson. Among
the best-known horses he owned in Maoriland were
Tambourini, Fishhook, Rubina, Florrie, Freedom,
Loyalty, Gipsy King and Response. But there were
two others and it was in connection with these
that Dan O’Brien’s name was made familiar all
over the Commonwealth —Trenton and Carbine. He
acquired Old Jack as a yearling at auction in Auck-
land for 620 guineas, brought him to Australia in
’BB, lost the V.R.C. Derby- to Ensign—and the rest
is history. Five years later Dan left his pub and
stables at Riccarton ard settled at Randwick, won
a few good races but lost a lot more, drifted back
to Maoriland, where he took a pub at New Plymouth,
raced with fair success, returned to Australia with
Mafanui and won a Caulfield Cup eight years ago.
The next move was to pub-keeping in Sydney. In
that he struck a sure winner. The old man was a
rare good judge of a horse. He was 68 and looked
more, except when he was beaming at a picture
hanging in the pub at Surry Hills. It was a
photo of Carbine.
* * * *
“Trot”: I have often wondered what
amount of good luck attached to Dan O’Brien’s pur-
chase of Carbine. Of course the old man maintained
in later years that he knew he was buving a good
’un, and was so certain of it when bidding for the
youngster that he would have parted with hatsful to
get him. Well, that’s natural. But I dunro. Just
at that time Musket’s get had been racing with great
success in Maoriland, and Dan had a good surplus,
so what more natural than that he should go after
one? Of course, his practised eye was attracted to
a well-grown colt, but that he saw anything in Car-
bine more than a “likely customer” is very doubtful,
and that Dan thought any more of him when Car-
bine won his first race at Plumpton Park, Christ-
church, is doubtful, too. I happened to see that
race, and the future champion didn’t seem a reason-
able excuse for bursting into prophecy. What hap-
pened was that after he had won the Champagne
Stakes at Riccarton Dan found himself in possession
of a colt that developed exceptionally well and jus-
tified him in having a cut at the three-year-olds in
Australia. How good the nag was Dan never sus-
pected, and the defeat by Ensign greatly discounted
the views he had on the subject. Otherwise it is a
sure thing he would never have parted with the
horse to Wallace for 3000 guineas. It was a lucky
purchase in the first place, and as things went an
unlucky sale at the last. Still, Dan’s judgment was
good. He acquired for 30 guineas a gelding that won
him the Champagne Stakes at Randwick, and in the
following year the A.J.C. Derby. That was Bob
Ray, named after an old-time trainer and rider he
knew in Maoriland. And most other men would have
sold Maranui before that good horse came into his
own. But Dan had, perhaps, had enough of selling.
There was always the off-chance of having another
Carbine on the premises. Dan did better than most
men with horses, but at the finish of it all the cash-
register in the pub was the best winner he ever got
on to.

Alfred Hill, who died at Sydney last
week, was a many-sided sport. Before reaching the
age of relaxed muscles he was a formidable boxer
and wrestler; later on he became a racehorse patron
and breeder. Sixteen years ago Hill dropped into
the chairmanship of Tatt.’s Club, Sydney, where he
looked after a comfy job until the end. His early
experience in handling wild spirits in Moree
(N.S.W.) stuck to him in directing the Owners,
Breeders and Trainers’ Association. He was a Sydney
native, and was at the 76th milestone when he
weighed out after a short illness.

The wowsers of Adelaide —they candidly
called themselves that, stipulating only that they
should not be styled “killjoys”—had hardly a chance
when they made a deputation to Chief Secretary
Styles to have racing cut down in S. Aus. Styles
had looked up the figures, and told them that N. S.
Wales has 76 meetings in one month as against 88
for the whole year in widespread S. Aus. About
Adelaide —-and going as far afield as Gawler and
Onkaparinga—there are only 32. Also in S. Aus.
any bookmaker is liable to arrest if found at his
work, whether on a course or elsewhere ; there is no
trotting ; there are no proprietary courses or “small”
meetings. The Adelaide wowser does not know when
he is well off.

Athletics in Victoria, playing dominoes.
We’re getting on. There are signs and
portents. Premier Holman has assured a deputation
that he is going to get his crowd to do all it can
to encourage Australian literature. Now the M.L.
Grand National Hurdle, worth 1200 sovs., has been
won by Art—the only time it has ever been placed
first in the shaky isles.

Someone up in Northern Bananaland has
an animal by Brae of Angus—Chambermaid, and
calls it Jerry L. The classical name made it so wild
at the Herbert River meeting the other day that it
rushed away from the opposition and won two races.
“Sardonyx” : That “Grand Russian Cup”
(B. 24/8/ j-v) recalls an old-time event at Bendigo.
It was “For horses that are in regular draught use
only; any age; riders not under 10 stone; one
mile.” It was the funniest field that ever came
together—from a moke as big as an elephant to a
12-hand milk-cart pony. Last to come to the post
was the lamentable hauler of a greengrocery cart.
Though the wreck had about him suggestions of
former make and shape, his poor old bones could
hardly raise a gallop, and a shout of derision went
up as, for the first quarter-mile, he doddered along
at the tail of the hilarious procession. Then he
livened up suddenly, and in another quarter-mile
had worked up to second place, where he stuck till
about 400 yards from home. Then he streaked out
like magic and won as he liked. “No thanks to
you for it,” I said to the - rider afterwards. “That’s
right, mister,” he grinned. “I left it all to ’im.
That’s old Pizarro!”
* * * *
The A.J.C. (Sydney) has knocked an
objectionable institution of long-standing on the
head; henceforth advertised starting times will be
absolute, and clubs must push off events to the tick
or be prepared to face trouble. In old days coups on
faked starting times were possible; but Ikey is a
careful citizen nowadays, and the gun who wants to
catch him on a lurk of that sort has to start moving
before the poultry commence giving the worms a go.

What was said to be the smallest pony
in the world was sold by auction in London the
other week in aid of the Actors’ Orphanage fund.
The little animal stands 26in. high, and is shapely.
But, after all, the smallest midget pony under the
sun is a very minor freak compared with the human
midget record-breaker, Lucia Zarate, who stood 18in.
high and weighed only 4|lb.
“Davy” : I don’t know the top age reached
by an Australian nag, but I do know that S 3 years
ago I rode a three-year-old hack between Lismore
and the Tweed (N.S.W.) and that the animal died
last year.
The Corowa (N.S.W.) club has cancelled
this year s ir.ter-State coursing match. The annual
event is for four dogs nominated by a N.S.W.
selection committee and four nominated by a Vic.
committee. It so happens that three out of four
of Ma’s best dogs are owned by one man, S. S.
Bennett, but he, being sick, cannot undertake to
run his animals. Therefore the Corowa club has
dropped the match, much to the anger of Vic.
owners, who had gone to some bother over it. It
all comes of leaving things to a private club. Any
inter-State “test ’ event should be conducted by the
sport-controlling bodies in each State. But the
hares have not entered any objection.

Jack Cole, of Sydney, who got the verdict
against Yankee Moy at Sydney Stadium a couple of
weeks ago, fulfilled the expectations of this page
by turning up next time a loser. He was stacked
against Tommy Uren on Saturday, waded in to make
a fight of it, and got a first-rate hiding. After
seeing him walloped for four rounds the police inter-
vened and Uren received the official blessing. Cole
was much too crude for the job, and the net result
of the conflict was to make him look rather worse
and Uren considerably better than either should be
regarded.
Died in New Norfolk Asylum the other
day, Bill (“Blinky”) Turner, the Speck’s foremost
pug of recent years. A prolonged specimen of
humanity, with a stousher’s dial, Bill carried a
mighty punch, and if he had had a better headpiece
it would have carried him a long way. As it was
he held the heavyweight championship of the Speck
for several years, his performances including vic-
tories over Mike Williams and Jack Lester, the
Yankee white hone that needed such a lot of faith
and charity. Some months ago Turner got a crack
on the head with a bottle; and after that the poor
beggar had a dreadful time.
* * * *
“Sur”: Saw a draft of recruits strip the
other day at Brisbane, and the pick of the bunch
was the old-time pug Arthur Cripps. Yet there are
not many men who started battling so young or who
have had more hardships. Cripps scooted from home
when he was 12, and first got a job on a fishing-
boat. Then he drifted around Bananaland toiling at
meatworks, sugar-mills and in the mines at the
Towers ; thence to W.A. with a mob of cattle; after
that, prospecting. It was at Marble Bar that I
first tumbled against him and Jack the Rajah.
They had been out eight months, and didn’t care if
they never went back again. Later, Cripps was on the
railway to Cue, earned a crust at Kalgoorlie, turned
up in Sydney as a pug, mixed boxing with a book in
S’Africa, had a pub in London, biffed his way along
in America, and after more fights in Sydney settled
down to become a hayseed. But there is no rest on
the farm these times with the noise of a big scrap
going on over the horizon, so Cripps is off to see
what the disturbance looks like.

Pat Cameron, killed in action in
France, was a typical sunny-faced Australian of 31.
He pulled on a jersey in N.S.W. Rugby Union’s
representative XV in 1912, delved in the scrum with
Eastern Suburbs in Sydney first-grade football, and
later on was a stalwart in Rugby Union manage-
ment. Another topnotch athlete gone West in France
is Vic Speller, a cyclist of merit, both amateur
and professional, in N. S. Wales. Speller, who was
previously wounded in Gallipoli, left a clean record
of a sunny sport.
* * « *
Killed in France, George Challis, one of
the finest footballers the Australian game has pro-
duced of recent years. A native of the Speck, he
was for years a leading figure in football on the
Island and then ’listed with Carlton. For a long
time he was one of the idols of the Melbourne
barracker. He played for Vic. in several rep. con-
tests, and was one of the outstanding players of the
last inter-State carnival.
Dave Low, passed out at the Front,
was, until he enlisted last year, one of Adelaide’s
best toeballers. Several years ago he was persuaded
to leave Broken Hill and throw in his lot with
West Torrens. Dave was Magarey medallist in
1911. a prized distinction among footballers _in
S.A., for it carries with it the reputation of being
the fairest and most brilliant player of the League.
He was in Sydney in 1914 with the S.A. team that
took part in the Australian Rules carnival.
Three more Sydney footballers have gone
down in the Headlong Charge—Cameron - (Eastern
Suburbs Union), Bolt (Newtown League) arid Somers
(Glebe League). They were fine players arid: good
types of manhood. When war began Eastern Suburbs.
Union possessed a great side. Of that 1914 team
Harold George, Fred Thompson, Cameron, Jack
d’Alpuget and Jim Bosward have had their last
scrum; Harald Baker has been incapacitated, pro-
bably for life. Doss Wallach, Harold Corbett and
one or two others are still tearing in at the Hun.
Hats off to them all.

Royal Navy gave Annandale the shock
of the season in the Sydney Soccer championship
final on Saturday. Annandale, having made mince-
meat of the clubs, considered there was nothing to
worry about; but the Tars brought such a vigorous
boot along that the champions only just won by
3 goals to 2. This was the closest to taking the
championship the Navy bad been since 1911; but
Annandale acquired the taste in 1913.
In the final of Manly (Sydney) Golf
championship during the week-end Larry Seely was
duly scalued bv Eric Apperly to the tune of 12 up
and whatever it is to go. As Anperly finished the
first 18 holes six up the previous week, the end was
pretty obvious. Seely has been playing very little
golf of late and was altogether below championship
form. But there was a time when Larry was one
of the toughest of nuts. A stranger seeing him
chopping off a tee with a driver roned round the
grip, or putting, croquet fashion, with his gaspipe
putter, wouldn’t bid more than tuppence for his
chances in open company. But Larry has more than
once been champion of champions, which means quite
a lot. In form he is a clean take-down at golf, just
as be is in various other athletic ways.
Christoe’s win in the Australian meda.
competition at Kensington on Saturday was another
remarkable achievement of a remarkable goiter.
Christoe, who has been bank-managing since some
prehistoric era, is not exactly a youth; and his
style is as far away from the models as the Kaiser
is from victory. But he is a forceful, vigorous old
party—well, we’ll withdraw that and say elderly
party—and he gets there just the same. To win
from the plus 2 mark against all the leading expo-
nents, professional and amateur, is, as the WoNG-
wibindie Gazette would say, no mean performance;
and the winner's 75 in the afternoon was nifty
golf. Soutar’s 74 was the best gross round of the
day. That’s six strokes better than Bogey. It is
one of the stock arguments of the golfomaniac that
the long competition is meant for the short handi-
cap man; and probably that’s good golf logic. Any-
how, the fact that in Saturday’s struggle eight of
the first nine were plus men and the other one
scratch will justify the holders of the view in
saying “There yar!” and jumping on anyone who
interrupts.
* * * *
An incident in last Saturday’s match
for the doubles tennis championship of Sydney Club
between Peach brothers and Jordan and Pockley,
though not unique, illustrates the luck of the game.
With the score two sets all, five games to three,
Jordan led. F. Peach, serving with the tally 40
to love against him, made a weak stroke and
Pockley proceeded to kill it and thus win game,
set and match. But he mulled the stroke, where-
upon the Peaches pulled themselves together and
lifted the match out of the fire. Jordan and Pockley
were so pleased.
* * * *
Again on Saturday the Grandenmnge family
of Mascot (Sydney) showed some other people the
way. Two of them ran first and second in the
Botany Club’s three-mile road race, Haydon, the
State champion, being third. As a hurry-up family
the Grandemanges must about hold a record.
* * * *
After overhauling the machinery, N.S.W.
Cricket Association is hoping for the best. Three
grades will be instituted, but for the present there
will be no premiership. The eight-ball over (agreed
to unanimously by delegates) and a new scoring sys-
tem will be used; and with £776 in the till and a
strong faith, the Association threatens to put its
optimism to the test by beginning on October 7.
But this page fears the game will be under a cloud
for a season or two.

“C. Sec.”: We were camped in the desert
where water was scarce and washing of clothes im-
possible. One chap who had been in camp only a
couple of weeks was making witty remarks at our
daily “round-up.” “Haven’t you got any on you?”
growled an old hand. “Certainly not!” replied the
scoffer. “How long have you been here?” “Couple
of weeks.” “Well, tell you what I’ll do. I’ll give
you 50 piastres for your shirt if you’ll pay me five
piastres for every one I catch.” “Bight!” The cash
and shirt changed hands, and we gathered round to
watch the coursing match. When the experienced
hunter had caught 70 piastres’ worth the new hand
cried, “That’ll do!” I never saw a soldier look
so wistfully at his shirt.
Ehlirth and Murrell (Q.) settled their
rivalry in wood-chopping the other day, and inci-
dentally registered a tall performance. When Murrell
won the championship a year ago, he worried through
the block in 61see.—2sec. better than Ehlirth. This
year Ehlirth slaughtered wood of the same circum-
ference in 52 l-ssec. against Murrell’s 55sec. Ehlirth’s
fine swinging axe suggests that he is the most
handy person with the instrument in the Northern
State.
“The man is your husband, is he not?”
said the South Melbourne magistrate to the
“lydy.” “Oh, yes,” was the reply. “He’s
my husband, all right. But he’s not wanted
on the job.”
The tourists stood gazing at a snow-capped
range at a Victorian resort. All were enrap-
tured. Each tried to find the suitable poetic
epithet for the splendid vision. But it was
the bloke who drove the drag that got it.
“Strewth, yes!” he said ; “like a foamin’ pint
of beer.”
It called for Victoria’s Chief Justice and
two learned brothers to determine that a
spade, though in certain circumstances it
may be a shovel, is not a plough nor a scari-
fier. The bother arose through a Melbourne
pastrycook being fined for paying an em-
ployee less than the wages fixed by the
Bread Board, the said employee being then
engaged in making hot-cross buns. The
Full Court held that the man, being wholly
engaged on bun-moulding, was not a bread-
maker, but a pastrycook, and therefore
properly paid under that Board’s determina-
tion. It didn’t cost this happy country more
than two or three hundred pounds to get this
matter decided; but, then, it probably wasn’t
decided with quite as much special know-
ledge as an average breadcarter could have
brought to bear on the problem.

Rheumatism
SCIATICA, COOT, LUMBAGO, etc.
In the majority of eases of Rheumatism,
Gout, Sciatica and similar complaints the
excruciating pain is caused by sharp-pointed
crystals of Uric Acid penetrating the delicate
and highly-sensitive nerves of the body. To
effect a cure this excess of Uric Acid must be
removed, and no treatment that does not aim
at this result will effect a cure.
Dr. Parker s Great Indian
Rheumatic Remedy
goes to the root of the trouble, and by remov-
ing the cause quickly affords relief and
eventually effects a permanent cure. Read
the following testimonial:—
SEVERE CASE OF RHEUMATISM CURED.
Merino, Vic. —I suffered terrible pain
across the groin, around the loins and hips,
right down to the ankle. I could not sit up
or lie with any comfort. After taking a few
doses of your medicine I could get about. I
am most thankful to you for the benefit I
have received from your wonderful medicine.
Hoping that others will go to you for relief
and kindness. —Your gratefully,

It’s a Masterpiece—
The “Plum” Razor
“C. Ockney” : Though the prolific Somerset
Maugham has had a dozen or more present-
able plays produced, only one, so far as I
know —the comedy “Lady Frederick,” in
which Ethel Irving starred —has hitherto
been seen in Australia. But now
the Williamson firm is to stage his
romantic “Land of Promise” at Melbourne
Royal, with Madge Fabian in the leading-
lady part, played, when the piece was pro-
duced at the Duke of York’s, by
Irene Vanbrugh (Mrs. Dot Boucicault).
Maugham, by the way, christened one of his
earlier comedies “Mrs. Dot,” and Mr. Dot
was the producer.
“H.”: Actor-manager Cyril Maude, back
here in London after a year’s touring in
U.$.A., was struck by the encouragement
given to students of dramatic writing. At
Harvard University he found regular courses
of lectures in the art and technique of play-
making under Professor Baker. At the Car-
negie Institute, Pittsburg, he found a first-
class dramatic school, teaching not only the
technique of acting and play-writing, but
also scene-painting, costume-making—every-
thing in fact, connected with the stage:—
In this way years of drudgery and fighting and
making mistakes are saved. America realises that
drama is altogether a different form of literature
from novel- and story-writing. Why do"we not follow
the excellent example set us by America ? The
reason is that we like to cling to the old ways of
doing things. Our great Universities are now
beginning to admit engineering, and I don’t see why
they should not admit play-writing too.
Why not —and the principles of tight-wire
performing and animal-act training, too?
Nance O’Neil has canned “The Fires of
St. John,” the sultry Sudermann play with
which she one-time tickled the wowsers.
The censors of morals commenced to sharpen
their teeth as soon as the canning was men-
tioned.
“Masetto”: Catch tenor Cappelli’s little
joke in “Faust”? In the scene where
he first accosts Margherita, and that lady
demurely informs the amorous hero that she
does not want anyone to see her home, the
tenor looks after her retreating form and
remarks, “Vair-ee sor-ree!” It floated as far
as the front stalls one night when the
orchestra was not as noisy as usual.
“Ami”: I still sigh after Bland Holt
and Mrs. Bland. Nothing like Holt’s pro-
ductions since, in Sydney or Melbourne. It
was not his fault that the public would
always regard Bland the comedian as the
centrepiece instead of Baker the hero. Bland
won great honor amongst actors by being
scrupulously fair in handing out the “fat”
to Baker, Styan, Norman, Charley Brown,
Maxwell and everyone /else. Then how
complete a pair were Frances Ross and
Harrie Ireland !
Actor Charlie Waldron, now in London,
has been telling interviewers that the best
bit of luck he has had was a visit to Aus-
tralia in “The Squaw Man.” Why? So
nice of him! Because he met and married
a Sydney girl, the beauteous Miss King,
of Prestonville, Potts Point.
“J.F.H.” : Exactly half a century has
passed since G. V. Brooke went down in the
London. Yet a few of the actors and
actresses who played with him still survive.
Dolores Drummond, who played leading
Shakspearian roles with him in Australia,
is living in retirement in London. Walter
Joyce, who played lago to Brooke’s Othello,
has just made his final exit at 80. He ran a
London pub during his latter years, but kept
up the old connection by reciting the “Charge
of the Light Brigade” at all sorts of func-
tions —mostly at a guinea a time.
From London :
Australia, being a long way off, is very useful to
the press puff-agent. Anything can happen there.
So Violet Lorraine gets her portrait and a par in
the Daily Mikror on the strength of an Australian
flag in her dressing-room at the Alhambra. It was,
according to the puff-agent, presented to her by an
Anzac who accosted her in a London street with the
remark: “You don’t remember kissing me, do you?”
Of course, she didn’t. Then he reminded her that in
Sydney she was collecting on the Stock Exchange for
the Captain Scott Memorial Fund, and offered to
kiss anybody who would put a 10-pound note into
her box. “I got a whole heap of money in that
way from the members,” says the modest Violet’s
advertising manager; “and this Anzac was one of
them.” I always understood that the Sydney Stock
Exchange was composed chiefly of elderly deacons;
and for the sake of the Church and in the interests
of domestic peace I hope somebody will write to say
that it never happened.
“Jwosp”: Minister of Internal Affairs
Russell, of Maoriland, is the latest to freeze
on to the film censorship. He induced Par-
liament to pass a Bill which provided that
when a management has a picture unsuit-
able for children it must announce the fact
outside the doors. Of course, it was a
showman in canny Dunedin who got in
first. He advertised that he would sell no
tickets to children during current week.
As a result, if you wanted to get into the
theatre you had to cut your way through
the crowd with an axe.
SEEING’S BELIEVING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An actor I since ’92,
I’ve figured on the stage
In many parts, in dramas new
And plays of greatest age;
And I have thought this' work of mine,
Especially in the tragic line,
To be unusually fine.
The critics oft have scoffed at me.
I scorned them all. I thought:
“How can these untrained varlets see
The subtlety I’ve brought
To play upon this character?”
I said: “It human is to err—
Too human critics ever were.”
' I am a broken man! I’ve watched
A picture play to-night.
I was the hero, weirdly botched.
My critics all were right!
’Twas Bobby Burns who hoped that we
Might see ourselves as others see.
That’s my supreme catastrophe!

When a sudden
fright makes you
jump or drop
things it is a sign
that the nerves
are unstrung and
probably the
whole system
run down. This
condition may be induced by too much work,
insufficient sleep, mental worries, an injury, or
the abuse of alcohol. As a preliminary, there
may be pains in the head, irritability, sleepless-
ness, general indisposition, headache, vomiting
and constipation.

How to Treat Your Hair and Complexion.
A Few Simple Beauty Hints.
By Mdlle. GABY DESLYS, the well=known Parisian Actress.
YOU ask me for a few hints on the
treatment of the hair and complexion.
Well, the less “treatment” you give
thing is a good shampoo. Never use any-
thing inferior to wash the hair with. Get
some good stallax from your chemist and use
the skin the better. I do not
believe much in massage, but a
little cream to the face is neces-
sary to counteract the effects of
wind or sun. What cream
would I recommend? Well. I
advise you to use a little mer-
colised wax every night ,and
again in the morning, after
washing the face. Rub it
gently into the skin, then wipe
off any superfluous wax and
dust a little barri-agar over
the face. You will find that
this will be the only “treat-
ment” necessary and will keep
your face fresh and youthful-

a teaspoonful in a cup of hot
water. Then rinse the hair
well and it will look bright and
glossy.
A tonic is necessary when the
hair is inclined to fall out more
than it should, and is always
good to use during the spring
and autumn. Then the hair
needs a do you call
it?—stimulant, and for this I
would advise you to get a packet
of boranium and mix it with
some bay rum ; dab this into the
roots and it will not only stop
the fall, but make your hair
grow long and thick. Give your
looking, for all your life. The mercolised
wax removes all the dead outer skin, so
that you have always a fair, fresh com-
plexion like a girl’s.
For the hair, the first and most important
hair a good brushing every night, and that
will be all that you need do.

Blackheads Fly Away.
Instantaneous Remedy for Blackheads, Greasy Skin and Enlarged Pores.
A practically instantaneous remedy for
blackheads, greasy skins and enlarged pores,
recently discovered, is now coming into
general use in the boudoir. It is very
simple, harmless and pleasant. Drop a
stymol tablet, obtained at the chemist’s, in
a tumblerful of hot water. After the effer-
vescence has subsided bathe the face in the
liquid, using a small sponge or soft cloth.
In a few minutes dry the face and the offen-
sive blackheads will come right off on the
towel. Also the large oily pores immedi-
ately close up and efface themselves natu-
rally. The greasiness disappears and the
skin is left smooth, soft and cool. This
simple treatment is then repeated a few
times at intervals of four or five days, to
ensure the ..permanence of the result.
Grey Hair—Home Remedy.
An old-fashioned Recipe restores Youthful Appearance.
There are plenty of reasons why grey
hair is not desirable, and plenty of reasons
why hair dyes should not be used. But, on
the other hand, there is no reason why you
should have grey hair if you do not want
it. To turn the hair back to a natural color
is really a very simple matter. One has
only to get from the chemist two ounces of
concentrate of tammalite and mix it with
three ounces of bay rum. Apply to the
hair with a small sponge for a few nights
and the greyness will gradually disappear.
This liquid is not sticky or greasy and does
not injure the hair in any way. It has been
used for generations with most satisfactory
results by those who have known the
formula.
To Kill Roots of Superfluous Hair.
The most Effective Formula ever Discovered.
Women annoyed with disfiguring growths
of superfluous hair wish to know not merely
how to temporarily remove the hair, but how
to kill the hair roots permanently. For
this purpose pure powdered pheminol may be
applied directly to the objectionable hair
growth. The recommended treatment is
designed not only to instantly remove the
hair but also to actually kill the roots so that
the growth will not return. About an ounce
of pheminol, obtainable from the chemist,
should be sufficient.
Good News for Fat People.
Something New in Obesity Cures.
A London chemist says: “The latest
method of reducing obesity certainly is far
more pleasant and convenient than all pre-
vious methods. It consists merely in eating
clynol berries. The fat person who wants
to reduce without the usual rigid diet, exer-
cise, sweating baths, etc., now puts a few
of these little brown berries in his or her
pocket and eats three or four each day.”
Clynol berries not only eliminate fat from
the body, but also correct the tendency,
which is usually constitutional, to create
fatty matter. No discomfort whatever is
caused .by their action; in fact, except for
the loss of superfluous fat and the feeling
of “fitness” so created, you would not be
aware that these little berries were doing
their work.
Local inquiry shows that clynol berries are
not very well known in this country, but
the demand is increasing daily, and any
chemist can quickly procure them if specially
requested to do so.

Cunnamulla : Nonsense. If the Billjim to
whom The Bulletin is addressed doesn’t get it, it
is simply because some other Billjim thinks he’d
appreciate it more... .R.J.P.: And in spite of all
you say, there is a sinful waste of men—men who

non-combatant jobs; eager men who are fit for the

Cocky: Not one such word is permitted. Which is
why this paper said recently that Mahon could not

were forfeited or cancelled for nonfulfilment of labor
conditions. .. .Jack Frost: It was arranged that way
to represent the position of events... .S.A.K.: Well
written, but no point in it, unless it be that Mexican
rebels generally place the village idiot in command.

short... .Acock Green: The makings of a yarn, but

After personally seeing what war can mean
for the women of a defenceless country, the
“woman’s section” of the U.S. Commission
for Relief in Belgium has transformed itself
bodily into a women’s section for boosting
the “movement for national preparedness” in
the U.S.A,
On to their steeds the gallant men sprang,
And across the sand with clatter and clang!
My ! Didn’t the Turks run
To get out of the sun.
“Allah!” they cried, “where art thou?”
Billjim cried, “You’ll soon see him, you cow!”
“Allah! Allah!” they cried. “The devils are loose.”
Cried one brave Anzac then, “I’ll have your juice,”
And with that he ran poor old Johnny Turk through ;
Johnny turned pale and then he turned blue;
And so would have you.
Whene’er I knock the ashes
From out my blackened pipe
I conjure up the glitter
And smoulder of real life.
The living sparks doth flicker
And when they waneth low
’Tis a lottery between fate and skill
To fan ’em to a glow;
Whene’er I knock the ashes
From out my blackened pipe
I realise the glitter
And flutter out of life.
Rude crosses we made with wooden chunks
To mark onr comrades’ permanent bunks;
We had neither hammer nor bloody saw
But their graves are marked by the Almighty’s paw.
Land of the mushroom, oh most noble fungi,
Oft of thy praises loudly have sung I ;
Land of my puphood three-clover-leaf isles,
List to my song while the billy-can biles.
....Draper: Not enough information to go on. Is

Player-Piano
The Beale is more than a mere Player-Piano
on when you can correctly hrind out all the rhythm
and harmony of a musical composition.
It is an instrument ofextreme sensitiveness and so
utterly responsive that you express your musical
emotions almost without volition-instinctively
And at ary time it mey be converted for hand -
playing- when it is practically impossible to tell
it from a straight" Piano.
We know you will appreciate the superiority of
the BealeTt is Australian made.

Be Sure
It*s O-Cedar
EVERY piece of furniture in
your house will look better
after you have used O-Cedar Polish.
Dull, lifeless, dingy varnished woodwork,
will again become as sparkling and bright
as the day it was new. The beauty of the
grain of the wood will be brought out.
Smudges and seeming defects will disappear.
And, best of all, you do all of this without
hard rubbing or constant polishing.
Always Use
ar
[Registered in principal countries]
the O-Cedar Way
Remember you cannot get the desirable
' O-Cedar finish unless you use O-Cedar
Polish. It takes all dust, grime and scum off
your furniture first, and then gives that
high, hard, durable andlasting polish.
How to Use O-Cedar
Wet a piece of woollen rag with water and wring
dry. Then pour on O-Cedar Polish until the cloth
holds as much O-Cedar Polish as it does water.
Rub the surface to be cleaned thoroughly, then dry
with another piece of rag, rubbing until the desired
lustre is obtained. By following these simple di-
rections, you are assured of the best results
cleaner, brighter and prettier furniture.
Try a bottle of O-Cedar Polish today. You will be
more than delighted with the result it brings. Be
sure to use it the O-Cedar way.

is now admitted by those who have given
the matter careful thought, to depend
almost entirely on the kind of shav-
ing soap used. After three
years of experimenting,
Enclosed in a collapsible
tube, it can be kept clean
and aseptic. Concentrated
and free from caustic, a
very small amount will
( produce a rich creamy
lather that will not dry on
the face, or burn the skin.
It will soften the tough-
est beard without the
mussy ‘rubbing in” and
the “morning hot-water”,
that were, heretofore, con-
sidered essential.

Weakness
Every movement of the body
uses up a definite amount of
vitality That is why you
feel tired at the end of the
day. When you overtax
yourself, or when your
vitality is undermined by
illness, your whole system
becomes too exhausted to
recover its lost vitality with
out assistance. Your system
is like a plant that is
drooping for want of water
And just as water revives
a drooping plant —so
Wincarms' gives new life
and new vitality to a weak
ened constitution. Because
‘ Wincarms possesses a
four-fold pftwer It is a
Tonic, a Restorative, a
Blood-maker, and a Nerve
Food —all in one. Therefore

IN
BANANA LAND
The Labor press of Queensland is howl-
ing at the local Upper House for throwing
out the party’s measures. But in the
matter of conscription it is jubilantly look-
ing to the Senate to trample on the Bill if
Hughes dare introduce it. Consistency
never was a virtue of the fanatic.
Though the Labor policy is to make the
big freeholder disgorge by ‘ taxation, the
Ryan Government contemplates buying back
Cecil Plains, 130,000 acres, the last of the
big freeholds in the Dalby district. There’s
nothing like a big Government purchase to
puff up land values; so the good work of
boom and burst promises to get a lift.
Bananaland Local Authorities sagged at
the. knees the other day because someone
had discovered a flying tick. But entomo-
logist Tryon restored confidence by pointing
out that, Linnaeus discovered the beast as
far back as 1761, and that it does little or
no harm and is a slow breeder. People got
the idea that the ordinary cattle-tick had
found the old method of assault too slow
and had adopted wrings, and cattle men
shook in their boots until the official assur-
ance was given.
Minister Adamron remarks that he found
the pay of railway officers higher in N. S.
Wales than in Queensland, which probably
means still further increases for the chosen
of the Northern State. Adamson also dis-
covered “a tendency in N. S. Wales towards
making the control of the railways more
democratic,” which of course means more
political and less expert. Whenever Queens-
land Ministers want a bad precedent they
turn to the Ma State.
There was “tremendous enthusiasm” at
Brisbane Stadium the other night at a
recruiting rally. But the enthusiasm was
chiefly confined to the 2500 soldiers pre-
sent. The 1500 odd civilians were so
enthusiastic that they could produce only a
dozen recruits, and most of them had made up
their minds lorig before the meeting started.
Recruits in Queensland cost £lO apiece to
rope in. and for last month the State
returned only about 800 against the quota
of 1780. Meantime a well-known and suc-
cessful recruiting-sergeant states that of all
the men he is credited with having enlisted
he could only say that two were persuaded
into khaki by his personal endeavors. The
others would all have enlisted in any case
of their own accord. How much longer is
the farce to go on?
The Government is going to build a rail-
way to open up the Upper Burnett, the
district that kept beef in Queensland kitchens
during the big drought. The line will Bit
the North Coast railway at Gladstone or
Bundaberg. according to the success of the
politicians and business people who are pull-
ing the wires.
A recent Maryvale murder mystery had an
unusual ending. The suspect, whom police
arid civilians were chasing, evidently tired of
the pursuit, so he built a pyre, set it ablaze,
and, mounting it, helped himself out with a
gun. It was enough to make any Sherlock
Holmes bitterly declare the game was not
being played according to the rules.
Horace Tozer, who has passed out at 72,
arrived at Gympie in the early days of the
rush, and made money partly in mining and
partly by Costs. Entering Parliament in
1872, he pushed into office, and was a Minis-
ter in several Cabinets. He was the Home
Secretary who dealt with the famous shearers’
strike of ’9l, arid for his reward was given
the job of Agent-General in London, a billet
which he retained until about five years ago.
lie will live in Bananaland’s political history
as the maker of the record stonewalling
speech (nine hours) and as the most
quaintly inaccurate man who ever sat on a
Treasury bench *
Bananaland’s six-o’-cluckers are an eager
crowd. Before Premier Ryan could seize a
sandwich at Toowoomba, on his way home
from London, a deputation of ladies sur-
rounded him and demanded an immediate
drought. Ryan fenced with them and
bounded into the train.
DAYS PAST RECALL.
BENEVOLENT TEMPERANCE PARTY: “Ah, my poor fellow, do you never wish that you could
retrieve your past?”
SHEENEY JOE: “You bet I do, mum; many a jag I’ve had in them good old days.”
“Quisquam”: Costs, although scarcely
over the splendid gorge of the Ellerton-
Wren libel case, is again licking its chops
in joyous anticipation. There is mention
of an action by «T. B. Sharpe, M.H.R.,
against Wren for an injunction to restrain
John from blocking the plaintiff’s manage-
ment of the Daily Mail ; in the alternative,
Sharpe asks to have a certain contract
rescinded, and for £lO,OOO damages for
breach of contract. The Mail seems unable
to get out of tempestuous seas.
Bad old notions have to be crammed into
their graves as W. Denver crammed the
ghost of Geoff. Ware in the dream beloved
of all reciters. When the Chief Justice
lately gave the army the option -of taking
back two convicted criminals he presum-
ably forgot that it is no longer a dustbin
for rejects and failures, but the most hon-
ored profession of them all. Had the men
in the dock been barristers, his Honor
would not have thought of offering them
the choice of wigs or gaol. He would have
refused to dishonor his profession by mak-
ing it an escape-door for criminals. Yet the
army is no less honorable than the law, and
at present far more valuable.
“Barcoo’s” yarn of the Wild West: —
In the early days, before the railroad had poked
its nose over the Main Range, there were many con-
vivial gatherings on the western horizon. Tambo, on
the headwaters of the Barcoo, was the Mecca of the
men of the sunset. The great floods of 1870 entirely
isolated the town for three or four months, just when
a flock of bushmen were camped there. All the
cheques had long since been gathered in; but there
was still a plentiful supply of grog and an assortment
of capable thirsts. So at a meeting of ways and
means it was decided to manufacture a fresh supply
of money. The scheme worked well for a while, but
paper was too plentiful, and Bung became sus-
picious to the extent of putting up the shutters. An
angry, thirsty mob thereupon charged the groggery
and demanded the lifting of the blockade. Bung
stolidly refused. There was no argument; the noose
of a greenhide heel-rope was whisked over his head
and he was dangling from one of his own rafters. The
joke nearly went too far, and for days there was a
very sick but extremely complaisant landlord.
Another effort is being made to push the
long-talked-of bridge from ’Roo Point tj
Brisbane North. The proposal has bobbed
up at intervals ever since the ’93 flood, and
the question of a high-level or low-level
swing bridge has been discussed to a stand-
still. And as Premier Ryan has just re-
turned from England without any of Bull’s
cash, the proposal is certain to be counted
out once more.
“Dead Finish” : The idea of pooling “star
lots” of wool of a uniform character and
offering as one good line in the “big lots”
has been in vogue in Victoria for some years.
There, however, it is done by the right
people—the woolbrokers who are paid to
study their clients’ interests. The same
conditions would prevail in Queensland —
and N. S. Wales too —w T ere the brokers not
so much afraid of coming to nolts with the
almighty Wool Buyers’ Association ; for the
buyers are the only ones who benefit under
the present system. But the idea of the
small man having his lots classed by the
unfledged pupils of the Brisbane Technical
College is beautiful—especially as the cocky
is to be charged only 10 per cent, of the
value of each bale !
Gatherers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I have shut the world from my tired eyes
And my thoughts take honey-gatherings,
Under the swoon of the dreamland skies
Where a sleepy bird in the heather sings
And there are a million blossomings.
Like small brown bees my thoughts go forth
To the fields you planted with bud and
briar;
Where a. stream runs south and a hill climbs
north
And the broom is like a fire.
And now let loose on an incensed wind
Too high for a scented lip to lure,
The hush of the grasses left behind
And the shrinking daisy awhile secure;
They rock for a space with level wings,
For one heart-beat of a song’s refrain—
A pause in the earnest gatherings,
Then back to the blossom-quest again!
O fancy fields, you have paid vour tithe,
You have found the store for the honey-
comb !
I have reaped your fragrance with winged
scythe,
And my brown-bee thoughts in a swift
swarm come;
With sacs well filled, they are hiving
home!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, August 26, 1916.
My Dear Tiiaijgomindaii,—
This has been “Do Without” week, and
Brisbane spent it in buyinsr tons of useful
things like squeaker balloons and badges.
So the effort to augment the patriotic funds
was a decided success.
Allies City was the big draw, and the
stalls had to be replenished daily. There
was a baby show on Friday afternoon and
300 infants were mobilised for the good
cause. On Tuesday night the Too-
wong girls gave a concert to swell
the funds, and on Thursday night
there was a torchlight procession.. Tne
raid concluded to-day with a flourish of
trumpets. This morning decorated motor-cars
started out laden with confetti and other
indispensable trifles. Two lines of cars met
his Ex. at the G.P.0., where there was a
furious bombardment for about 15 minutes.
It was one of the gayest and maddest turn-
outs Brisbane has seen. Lorries laden with
concert parties drifted about town all day
and coaxed showers of small coin. A long
programme of sports was conducted at the
Exhibition, where more stalls demanded the
last shilling.
Parliament was opened on Wednesday, but
the frocking was much more demure than
usual. Lady Goold-Adams wore green and
a black toque; President Morgan’s lady was
in grey ; Mrs. T. J. Ryan in cream. Ilis Ex.
was a gorgeous peacock in blue velvet, and
his aide, in a scarlet uniform and a helmet
with a magnificent plume, looked like an
escapee from a military tailor’s fashion-book.
The Royal Geographical Society held its
annual meeting last Tuesday, and his Ex.,
who is nearly recovered now, chatted about
Cyprus, after which the society passed the
ham sandwich.
The National Council of Women held its
annual meeting this week. Two addresses
were given, one by Mrs. W. Smyth, who
spoke on Women’s War Work in Zepland;
and the other by Mrs. Lee-Cowie, and of
course you know what she talked about.
Mrs. Smyth handed out the good advice that
Australian women should use only goods
made in their own country. Whereupon Lady
Goold-Adams mentioned that she had used
Australian-made goods ever since she came
here.
There is a Club in Brisbane which will
undertake almost any service for Billjim.
The other day the lion. sec. was informed
that a private who had been ordered to sail
next day was lamenting Ins expensive new
teeth, which were at the dentist’s. A Club
official hurried out for the molars, and found
the dental rooms in charge of a small boy.
who unearthed eight undistinguisliable sets.
The official seized the whole lot, sped to the
troopship, handed them up on a long
stick, and invited Billjim to take his piri:.
And wasn’t Billjim pleased ! He flashed the
ivories ait everybody through a porthole with
the delight of a beauty actress.
The Aboriginal Court at the Show was a
f’uaint mixture of nullahs, boomerangs,
helamans, a gunyah, school 'maps, knitted
socks, books, fans, lace and d’oyleys. Fancy
Warrigal and Kitty collaborating on a
i’oyley!
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Another cousin of the late Viking Rawson
(N.S.W.) has just gone into camp in Syd-
ney—F. E. Rawson. eldest son of Lance
Rawson, a pioneer of Mackay. F. E. Raw-
son was for many years mining in North
Bananaland, and was cyanide manager and
assayer for the Cecil Syndicate on that field.
He did a lot of prospecting from the Hodg-
kinson across to the Gulf j and knew many
shows, not only of gold, but of antimony,
bismuth, molybdenite, etc., which, given a
local market and means of transit, would
have been of great value. Under present
conditions they remain untouched. His
brother Guy, Crown Lands Ranger at Rock-
hampton, is already at the Front. Both
brothers enlisted as privates.

No flore Grey Hair
A Simple and Effective Mixture Can Be
Prepared at Home That Soon Darkens
the Silver Locks.
Grey, streaked and faded hair is as un-
sightly as it is unnecessary. Youth is our
greatest asset, and we should preserve it
and prolong it by every proper means avail-
able. Here is a remarkably good recipe,
simple and inexpensive, which can be readily
prepared at your own home.
To a half-pint of water add :
Bay Rum loz.
Orlex Compound 1 small box.
You can get these ingredients at any
chemist’s, and the preparation will be just as
efficacious for removing dandruff, stopping
falling hair and other scalp ailments as for
darkening grey hair. Apply it once a day
until the hair reaches the desired shade, and
then one application every other week will
be all that is needed. Be sure to try this.
It’s fine. —AnvT. [2

THIS year the dainty foot daintily shod
comes into its own. Never were skirts
shorter or fuller, never were shoes more in
evidence. So the smart woman will hail
with joy the arrival of the new Bostock styles

than ever. The shoe here illustrated, for example,
is typically charming. Cut from that most
elegant of materials, patent leather, made in
that new, short-fronted French shape which
makes every foot look so arched and delightful,
this is the shoe of shoes to give a telling finish
to one's new walking suit or gown. And it is only
one shoe amongst many equally desirable.

“II.M.”: Re those three oldest native-
born Australians (B. 17/8/TG). George R.
Tuekwell, one of them, who has lived at
Parramatta all his 91 years, is grandson of
men who were among the first arrivals. One
of them was quartermaster-sergeant with
the 102nd Regiment and the other —Samuel
a’Beckett —was a surveyor.- A’Beckett was
responsible for laying out Parramatta. Of
Tuckwell’s 14 children 11 still live; and
there are 53 grandchildren and 01 great-
grandchildren—a fair bit for Australia.
“H.S.R.” : “George Street” needn’t worry
—Wilhelm the Wicked will not run into
any danger. He is not built that way.
Remember how lie treated Oom Paul after
the Brito-Boer War? After encouraging
Paul all he could, he refused to see the
big old man when he was down and out.
No, Bill is a cur. He is all there to sool
others to death and doubtful glory, but pre-
fers to look on through his field glasses.
Neither was Napoleon a man of personal
courage. He cleared away from his broken
army as soon as it was safe to do so after
his Russian defeat, and also from Waterloo.
These people are only courageous, like the
wolves, when in large numbers. They
could no more fight a losing battle like the
British at Mons than they could fly. As
for Bill, his reputation is newspaper-made,
the product of sycophants and crawling
braggarts. El Ilaji Mohammed Shilio.um
his cobbers the saintly Turks style him.
They are well matched.
“Adelaide” : The practical Bishop Gilbert
White, of the new S. Aus. see of Willochra,
has brought with him from North Queens-
land one bad habit. In a circular just sent
round on behalf of all the churches, one
bishop signs sensibly as “A. Nutter Thomas,
Bishop of Adelaide,” but the other as “Gil-
bert, Bishop of Willochra.” Why mustn’t a
bishop have a surname? Is it in this case to
encourage his northern parishioner Billjim to
address him familiarly as Gil.?
“Pup Pup” dreams of a thrilling shave: —
If that barber named Ellis who was retained by
the British Government at a fee of £5 to produce’
Roger Casement to the Coroner doesn’t have to
enlarge his shop and engage 14 assistants, the cir-
cumstance will have to be mentioned at the next
Imperial Conference. Consider the attraction it
would be to Peckham Rye if travelling Australians
could depend on being shaved by the man who
administered Law to Roger! One could recline at
ease in the chair, and, while a youth slapped on the
soap, wait expectantly for the Crown’s assistant-
watch him run the blade up and down a strop with
dexterous fingers and mark the gleam in his eye as
he tried the edge on his thumb. Then he would
grab the customer by the nose —it would be the very
paw that greased the rope—gently turn the jugular
upwards, and start to scrape with the hand that put
the knot under the rebel ear. Australian barbers are
uncultivated persons. They talk of racing and
boxing. I loathe sport. This man could engage in
conversation about Bigger Things; could explain
how Casement took it—also what he himself did with
the fiver. By having a shave, a haircut, a shampoo

“Exile”: San Francisco possesses more
marble interiors to its buildings than any
other city on earth. There are 221 office
blocks with thousands of rooms, besides
about a hundred banks and public offices,
all ferro-concrete and finished with marble.
Every variety and color of marble has been
used. It is really a gorgeous city inside.
So despitefully do we use our marble iu
Australia that one can affirm there is no
modern marble building in the country.
Why? The deposits at Buchan and Ben-
ambra in Gippsland are as fine, as varied
and as extensive as any marble quarries in
the United States. Yet they stay unused
while we live in the inartistic brick and
wooden shanties we call homes and offices.

Truth is more lurid than fiction. Ran-
dolph Bedford lately wrote a grim yarn
about 50 smuggled Chinamen who were
coming down to Sydney in a steamer’s
empty ballast tank and were drowned like
rats when the innocent officer of the watch
ordered the filling of their hiding-place,
intending merely to steady the ship. But a
private letter which reached Sydney last
week told how some sailors of Admiral
Beatty’s roaring Lion themselves flooded the
magazine they were workin" in during the
Jutland battle in order to put out a shell fire
and save the ship. What a death to die of
cool, deliberate choice!
A South Brisbaneite named Dunlop, with
the Flying Corps in France, gets an unusual
glimpse of eternity:—
While trying to reload my machine-gun I lost
control of the steering gear, and the aeroplane turned
upside down. The belt around my waist was loose,
and the jerk almost threw me out of the machine,
but I saved myself by clutching the rear centre strut,
while the belt slipped round my legs. As I hung
thus, head downwards, making desperate efforts to
disengage my legs, my machine fell from a height
of 8000 ft. to 2000 ft., spinning round and round like
a top. At - last I freed my legs and reached the
control lever with my foot. Then l managed to
right the machine, which turned slowly over, looping
the loop; after which, sliding back in my seat, I
brought it composedly to the ground.

In the Middle Ages, 400-600 A.D.
The lights of the Middle Ages were rush-
lights, torches, lamps arid crude tallow
candles, When lamps were used, they
followed the designs of the lamps of the
early Romans from whom they were handed
down. The craftsmanship displayed in the
lamps of the later Romans was entirely
absent. The fuel used was animal oil, which
was very unsatisfactory. With a highly
refined oil like

A big U.S.A. paper manufacturer assures
The Bulletin that Uncle Sam isn’t as
greedy as he looks
While prices of paper have undoubtedly advanced
here, I think the average rise has been 100 per cent.,
with some of 200 per cent.; and though the Yankee
paper mills may be criticised for this, don’t overlook
the British shipowner. It doesn’t matter whether
he was carrying to his own people or anybody else —•
up went the price! While the Yankee has charged
—well, we’ll say 200 per cent, more for paper, the
British ’shipowner’s freight to England has gone up
about 1600 per cent. Prior to the war we could
ship at 12s. 6d. from N’York. To-day the equivalent
i 3 200 s. The Yankee may have something to
answer for; but, in his wildest dreams he never
hoped for anything so remunerative as the ocean
carrying business, which is essentially British.
Incidentally this mill-owner doesn’t see any
early prospect of cheap paper:—
Raw materials are very dear. Our people sold
some bleached pulp recently at 5Jd. per lb.; ordi-
narily we should have been very glad to get lid.
for it. It was reshipped to Buenos Aires and cost
the paper mills there $250 a ton, as against the
usual $67 to $6B. From this you will see how trade
even between two neutral countries of America is
affected.
How the Backblocks Thunderer pulls
through in the best of times is one of the
great mysteries. It’s a greater mystery how
Jove makes his thunder pay the beer-and-
cheese bill now. Buying a few reams at a time
he has had to pay anything up to £6O per ton ;
and at this moment there probably isn’t 100
tons of “news” in all the warehouses _of
Australia. Even larger buyers, chasing
shipments wherever they could be got —
America, Scandinavia, England and recently
Japan—have been paying from two to three
times more than the price they grumbled at
before the world ran off the rails.

“Jwosp”: The editor is a very polite man
in Maoriland. For instance, Auckland
Herald declines “stomach” without thanks,
but will accept “abdomen.” Still, it prefers
“digestive organs.” They do it differently in
the Navy. There was the historical looten-
ant who found a seaman Writhing in pain.
“What’s the matter with you?” he snapped.
“Pain in me stummick, sir,” says Jack.
“Stomach! Stomach! !” roars his Gills.
“ You’ve got no stomach —only officers have
stomachs. You’ve got guts!” Down in
Christchurch the Times refuses to refer to
rape or shortcomings of that sort. The cit.
who gets into any such trouble goes to
clink for a “criminal offence,” which is very
comprehensive, if not very informative. It’s
only lately that the Times has discovered
that venereal diseases exist. They were
formerly “social evils.”

The Melbourne Labor Call printery,
twice “raided” lately by the military, takes
its troubles affably. After the second visit
it notified that, since the thing had appar-
ently become a habit, afternoon tea would
be kept ready on the premises for Pearce’s
faithful servants.

“St. Jimmy”: Imported Baptist-minister
Ruth, of Melbourne, in a sermon preached
on Eclipse Sunday, expressed a yearn for
a daily paper “free from the tafnt of
betting news.” The sad stranger doesn’t
' know that the old Melbourne Daily Tele-
graph anticipated his wishes a generation
ago, and died from poor circulation as a
result of catering for angels. Twenty years
later the same experiment w T as made in
Perth with exactly the same result. Evi-
dently angels don’t read newspapers.

“8.H.”: The German papers have been
exhausting their vocabulary on Lord North-
cliffe, giving Billy Hughes any crumbs they
may sweep up. According to the official
Cologne Gazette the head of the Harms-
worths is more guilty than anybody else of
“involving Europe in a bath of blood.” He
is the incarnation of the “great Anglo-
Saxon scheme of world-deception..” On
the last day Asquith and. Lloyd George may
escape Hell on the plea that they did not
know what they were doing, but there is no
chance for Northcliffe. The Frankfurter
Zeitung alludes to “the Australian Prime
Minister Hughes” as “the chief darling of
the Jingoes, who cannot be absent from any
official German-eating ceremony.” Little

and smacking his lips over it! In his most

could!

By winds and waves 1- The poor, thin sound
Sinks like an arrow in the sea.

With laughter rock and almost die.
A flattered curate full of tea
Is dour and sad compared with me l
A bank account’s a splendid thing,
Or so it seems when gold takes wing;
But comfort is the feather bed
On which the fighting soul lies dead ;
Who builds that bed no fun must seek.
Or feel the wind upon his cheek.
The clean, free open air for me l
The cold wind of Adversity
May blow my hat off like a gun,
But I will bask in Fortune’s sun
And find in-Freedom Wisdom’s proof
Beyond the slav’ry of a roof.
I may be wrong. Suppose I am,
I do not give a tinker’s dam.
Whom God made prudent, let him save~
For this and worlds beyond the grave.

Vacuum System
Can Your Car
Do This ?
Under its own power this car climbed this open jack-
knife bridge at the angle shown in this picture.
This feat was made possible only by the Stewart
Vacuum System.
A car without one could not do it.
Every car so equipped is absolutely sure of a perfect
and positive flow of petrol to the carburetter under
all conditions and on any grade.
With the old gravity system of petrol feed, your car is
dead whenever your carburetter is higher than your
petrol tank.
The pressure system requires endless, troublesome
hand-pumping—keeping air leaks out of the lines,
and often, when most required, it fails.
You need power to climb a steep hill —but you need
more than power —you need a sure, even flow of
petrol to your carburetter at all times.
A Stewart Vacuum System insures this.
It also saves 10 per cent, to 20 per cent, on petrol bills.
It is used by over 60 per cent, of all car manufacturers
as standard equipment.
It can be installed on your present car (any make or
model).
PRICE £,3 15|- complete.
Bear in mind in selecting your next car to
see that it is fully equipped with Stewart pro-
ducts; most cars are, and it costs nothing
extra. See that it has a Stewart Tyre Pump,
Stewart Speedometer, Stewart Warning Signal
and Stewart Vacuum System.

A Gallant Anzac Praises
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery
Private Roy Clark, No. 980, D Com-
pany, 2nd Battalion, A.1.F., enlisted
when first the A.I.F. was formed, and
left Sydney with the above Battalion
on 18th October, 1914. He was in
the famous landing at Gallipoli, and
went through the campaign until
wounded, which resulted in the loss of
his right arm, and caused him to be
returned to Australia.
I think every soldier should
take a bottle of Dr. Sheldon’s New
Discovery with him to the Front,
for it saved me from the torture
of a sore throat and colds all
through my experience, for I made
it a habit of taking a sip of the
Mixture two or three times a week.
This strengthened my throat and
lungs, and prevented coughs and
colds from which most of my
comrades suffered severely both
during our stay in Egypt and on
the Peninsula.
All the hoys speak most highly
of it, and it gives me much
pleasure to add my testimony to
that of my many pals who have
likewise found New Discovery so
beneficial.
Yours truly,
(Sgd.) ROY CLARK.

The Woman in the Background.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Woman in the Background she
sets the earth a-wliirl,
Though she be fat and forty, or just
a giggling girl. , . ,
Behind our woeful pleasure, behind our
happy woe,
The Woman in the Background goes luring
to and fro,
A-spinning and a-weaving, from virtue or
from sin,
The web that she the spider would have us
tangled in!
The Woman, in the Background, her eyes,
I vow to you,
Are brown, and grey, and opal, and blue as
skies are blue.
Her skin is white as snows are, and dark'
as winter skies.
She is freckle-less and freckled- —when she
isn’t otherwise.
She is Alpha and Omega, she is all things
in between,
The Woman in the Background, the virgin
Magdalene!
The Woman in the Background her hair is
raven black,
And gold, and brown, and flaxen—some
hanging down her back.
And some most cutely coiffured about her
dainty ears,
Regardful of the fitness of Fashion for her
years.
I swear that it is curly, I swear that it is
straight—■
But, straight or curled, assisting the game
of love and hate!
The Woman in the Background is tall, yes,
stately tall—
And short, and squat, and awkward, and
delicately small!
Her rounded breasts are heaving to lure
men to their doom ;
Her flattened breasts are grudging her heart
its beating room.
Her voice is sweet as honey, and sour
beyond compare—
The Woman in the Background for Whom
We Greatly Care!
The Woman in the Background her wisdom
is intense;
And it lacks the fundamentals of the plain-
est commonsense.
Flie finds our hidden meaning—she can
plumb it at a glance—
And her mind is steeped for ever in the
deepest ignorance.
She’s the champion riddle-reader, seeing far
as vision goes—
And the obvious she misses when it’s under-
neath her nose!
The Woman in the Background she lives
in Wealthy Square,
In a mansion and a garden, and her dad’s a
millionaire;
She is living down in slumdom, where the
roof lets in the rain,
Where the. stenches hurt the nostrils, and
the noises jag the brain.
She is living in a cottage—nothing more
and nothing less:
Fare ye forth, the quest is easy—l have
given her address!
The Woman in the Background, the One
Who Is To Blame,
She shrinks from our attentions, but gets
there just the same !
She is meek, and. mild and lowly, and bold
and debonair;
She thrills to all our gazes, and shudders at
our stare.
She is false as utter falsehood, and as true
as truth is true;
O Woman in the Background, my heart
goes out to you !

Bush Races.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PIOMEIIOW the little “grassfed races”
I have known on the fringe of civili-
sation cling in my memory more than
any spring carnival on Randwick, with its
flashing of silks and satins, the raucous
voice of Ikey, the show of wealth, the parade
of freaks and fancies. I don’t suppose we
ever had a millionaire at our meetings in
the back country; still, when squatters
joined with selectors and shearers and bush
\yorkers, there was plenty of money in
circulation, and fairly big sums changed
hands over very small races.
Along the western border of Queensland,
among the big runs, the men are nearly all
good horsemen. They have several of their
own, as a rule, and at times they race their
stock horses, which belong to the boss.
Drovers, travelling far and wide, pick up a
“dark ’un” here and there to spring a
surprise on their old friends.
There is keen rivalry between squattages
and keen rivalry between classes. These
men talk horse in their sleep. They
argue as to the merits of one and
the other whenever two of them meet;
and . in every wayside pub there is
prodigious boasting as to what “that there
prad o’ mine” has done in his day. He is
never quite equal to what he has been ; still
even now there is nothing in the district
can show him a clean pair of heels. In
parts where every man is known to everybody
else resident or circulating in several
contiguous counties, this sort of talk, going
bn all the year round, gives zest even to a
five-bob race that brings a few of the reputed
champions together.. At times there is a
little soreness and bitterness over the result,
tor the skiter, whose astonishing galloper
has been donkey-licked by a traveller’s pack
horse, hears sarcastic allusions to it
wherever he goes. Someone on the course
offers to run the quadruped on foot, a
straight 50yds. or 50yds. to a post and
back. Occasionally this sort of race comes
off, and it is not always the horse that wins.
The blue ribbon is the ladies’ bracelet—
or it may be a lady’s brooch. Bill-tlie-
stockman’s best girl nominates Bill’s best
horse; Squatter Junior’s young lady acts
similarly in respect of his; and great is
the joy of one and the chagrin of the other
when Bill’s best girl, who may be a
housemaid or the cook at the home of
Squatter Junior’s fiancee, acquires the
jewellery. More effort is made and more
money spent to win a two-guinea bracelet
than is usually expended to secure anything
else on the programme. Horses that are
saddled for it look surprisingly well for
untrained, grassfed animals. Their coats
shine like silk. They seem fit to run for a
princess’s casket, let alone a small ornament
that might decorate the bride of an
aboriginal fjtockman. They are required to
be paddocked for some weeks before the
races, but the clerk of the paddock must
sleep sometimes; and while he sleeps or is
otherwise absent, feeding, grooming and
training are surreptitiously going on in
the neighborhood of the enclosure. On his
morning’s round the clerk discovers new
openings made in the fence; he sees here
and there a lot of spilt chaff and corn and
oats. Following outward tracks, he finds
more evidence of prodigal feeding among
the bushes along the creek; and he comes
upon new-made training courses in nearly
every little hidden valley.
Now and again in the grey dawn, or early
on a moonlight night, he hears the thunder
of hoofs and sees phantom horsemen
speeding terrifically down the valley; or
perhaps he discerns a shadow form
vigorously grooming after a trial gallop.
In any case he seldom gets near enough to
recognise the culprit. Bill has an owl-eyed
mate keeping a look-out. He gallops off in
one direction, taking Bill’s hack with him ;
and Bill mounts the racer bareback, and,
dashing into the paddock, slips the bridle off
in the first convenient cover and sends the
horse cantering on to its mates. Sometimes
he stirs the mob up before dropping off, so
that the lot will be doing a canter as if for
exercise when the clerk of the paddock
comes up to them. Then Bill hides until
the way is clear for him to get out and join
his mate. Training is irksome and
precarious under such circumstances. But
he doesn’t mind ; he thinks of someone who
is dreaming of a little golden trophy. And
the thought that the other fellows, actuated
by the same gallant impulses, are doing the
same thing, keeps him pegging away. Nearly
every owner has someone watching the man
who is paid to watch the paddock; and as
they also have to watch one another, it is
the opinion of those who lose the race that
paddocking only entails a lot of unnecessary
work on owners.
The cut-out at big shearing-sheds,
especially near the end of the . season, or
when there is an interval of waiting before
the next shed starts, is marked by a day’s
racing, followed by a shearers’ ball at
night. The meeting place is a wayside
pub; it is the publican who makes the
arrangements. Horse-racing and dancing
are good for his business. Before bicycles
became plentiful on far-inland tracks, a
team of shearers, rouseabouts and musterers
could paddock a big mob of horses, among
which there* were generally some that had
performed well in good company, and though
the prizes were small they attracted good
fields, and the racing was earnest if it
wasn’t exceptionally swift. When the
bicycle displaced half the horses it did not
spoil the races; it added variety to the day’s
sports. A feature of some of these picnics
was the girl rider who, with a well-trained
horse lent to her by some admirer at the
shed, occasionally upset the doubles of the
whole team.
One of my earliest recollections of back-
country racing was a gathering of farmers
and selectors on a big cattle run. There
wasn’t a habitation of any kind within
miles of the meeting place. A couple of
fences undulating through the gums and
ironbarks were, the only signs of settlement.
The course was a cattle pad, running
parallel with one of the fences. The final
quarter-mile was level, and while the horses
followed the pad there were no logs to jump
or trees to pull round. The rest of the
course was down in a deep hollow, and just
beyond the winning post was the crossf
fence; but the double gate on the track
was propped open so that fast or hard-
mouthed horses could be pulled up in the
ordinary way in the bull paddock.
The prizes were bridles and saddles,
which were dumped in a heap at the butt of
a big tree. There was also a special prize
of a load of pumpkins, which had been
brought out by the farmer who gave them.
He was a prominent member of the club,
and wore some ribbon on his coat to
distinguish him from the common herd.
A stockman and a blackboy were tailing
heifers on the flat that day, and as good
light riders were scarce their services were
requisitioned* for the first race. Five horses
started, and as they tore up the straight the
string of hacks tied along the fence took
fright. They were not used to racecourses.
Bridles were snapped in all directions; some
of the fence was pulled down, and a dozen
riderless horses, with tails in the air, sped
before the racers through the open gate, and
sailed away with a tremendous clatter of
hoofs across the paddock where the bulls
were browsing.
The blackboy ran last. The horse’s owner
■ —who had been refreshing too frequently—
sent a bottle whizzing after him as he went
past, and afterwards accused him of “pull-
ing ” and challenged him to fight. On the
stockman’s advice the boy left to turn the
heifers. The exasperated owner took more
refreshments, which made him still more
pugnacious and increased his feeling of
having been wronged. He got on his horse
and galloped after the blackboy, whom he
pursued round and round the heifers, yelling
like a maniac, until the stockman met him
and knocked him off. Then he went to sleep
under a log.
Meanwhile two more races had been run,
and some more of the squattage fence had
been destroyed. The majority of the hacks
had been removed to the next paddock, where
the ladies were congregated round the pump-
kin cart. Horse-owners helped themselves
freely to the vegetables, smashing and
scattering them about for their trptters
and draughts. Empty bottles began to
bestrew the grass around the “grand
(Continued on next page.)


KIDNEY SUFFERI
ENSNEEDL
WO
Kidney disease in women often
reaches a serious stage before it is
recognised, because women are apt
to misunderstand the symptoms
and put them down to “female
troubles ’ ’ instead of the real cause
—the kidneys.
When there is kidney trouble
the kidneys and bladder are liable
to become inflamed and to swell
considerably, causing symptoms
which are easily taken for female
complaints —pain or weakness in
the back, dizzy spells, sick head-
aches, the eyes grow dim and puffy,
the ankles and limbs swell, the
complexion is yellow, you are soon
tired and can’t walk far, you sleep
poorly and feel heavy and languid
in the morning—there may be
urinary disorders and gravel.
With the use of Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills relief will be quick
and lasting, for Doan’s Pills restore
activity to the kidneys and bladder,
remove inflammation and expel the
kidney poisons which cause* women
so much needless suffering. This
medicine has no action on the
bowels. In use 75 years.

Two Sydney Women
Cured to Stay Cured.
FROM PADDINGTON.
Mrs. Jordan, 31 Green’s Road, Paddington,
Sydney, says:—“For a year 1 was a martyr to
. backache. When I sat down quietly for a time
and then got up suddenly the pain that shot
through me was dreadful. I tried all sorts of
medicines, but could never get anything to suit
me until I got Doan’s Backache Kidney I ills.
One day I picked up a circular in the garden
advertising these pills, and this led me to try
them. I am thankful to say that a few bottles
worked a complete cure in my case. They are
really first-class pills for backache.”
Sixteen years later Mrs. Jordan says: I
have been perfectly free of backache since
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me sixteen
years ago. This is a long time, and proof posi-
tive that this grand remedy cures to stay cured.
FROM MARRICKVILLE.
Mrs. C. I. Hunt, Music Teacher, 83 Sheppard
Street, Marrickville, Sydney, says:—“For years
1 used one medicine after another trying to get
relief for aching pains in my back. These pains
were very trying, and I could not move about
without getting a severe twinge, and at night my
rest was broken. A friend recommended Doan s
Backadhe Kidney Pills, and it was good advice,
for they gave me relief after a few doses, and a
thorough course completely banished the pain.
I did not write sooner, as I wished to test my
cure, but now that I have been well for some
time I am quite justified in saying that my
cure is permanent.”
Fourteen years later Mrs. Hunt says: —
“Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are worth their
weight in gold, for they cured my aching back
fourteen years ago, and I have been free of the
ailment ever since.”

stand," and three or four sportsmen
were already prostrate. The bar was
a plank, one end of which rested on the
bottom rail of the fence and the other on
the spoke of a cartwheel, the bulk of the
spirits being kept in the cart. There was
no luncheon booth. Everybody picnicked
under trees.
The fourth race saw the judge too un-
steady on his pins to mount the “box,” which
was a gin-case; but by sitting on it he
managed to strike a fairly-straight line with
the ironbark tree standing opposite. ( His
decision evoked a roar of laughter: The
two black horses a dead-heat.” There was
only one black horse in the race.
He appealed to the grinning group around
him: “Wotcher goin’ to do about it —run off
or divide th’ stake?”
The owner, grasping the situation, re-
plied: “They both belong to me; so it’s six
of one an’ half a dozen of the other.”
The judge fixed him with his eye.
“As to what’s one or the other, I’m judge
o’ that,” he retorted. “I ask yer wotcher
goin’ to and or run-off?”
“Oh, we’ll divide it.”
The prize was a saddle; but luckily the
judge did not insist on seeing the division.
His attention was diverted by two farmers
who were disputing the merits of Berkshires
and another breed of hogs. One, armed with
an empty bottle, was dodging round the
grog cart, while the other shuffled after him
with an ironbark sapling. The dispute was
settled abruptly by the capsizing of the bar,
and the impromptu publican routed the dis-
putants with a bucket of dirty water.
The women were harnessing up the dray
horses by this time in readiness for a start
for home after the next race; and it was
noticeable that the pumpkins began to dwin-
dle very rapidly. The girls had comman-
deered little heaps, and were laying two
pumpkins to one on their fancies. The
blacks were noisy. Only the tact of the
white women prevented the gins emulating
a section of the white men and violently
assaulting one another.
The Produce Stakes (for the pumpkins)
was run about sunset, and the judge, losing
his balance at a critical moment, saw only
the last horse go past, and promptly awarded
him the victory. It didn’t matter, however,
as the remnants of the prize were not worth
fighting over.
Trouble arose immediately the settling-up
commenced for the other events. The secre-
tary could find only a saddle —the prize for
the* big handicap. The bridles had disap-
peared. Angry voices arose, and the secre-
tary was accused of embezzlement and had
to take to his heels through the bush.
They were still settling up when night
fell. Some were settling old scores with
their fists; dogs were fighting among and
around them, and blacks fought with wad-
dies and bottles. The noise was tumultuous.
The women were active participants in the
mfflee, each trying to pull her man away
and administering a dig to his antagonist
when opportunity offered. It was a great
day.
The efforts of the peacemakers prevailed
at last, and the sound of cartwheels was
soon heard going off in many directions.
Loud voices, offering to run anything on the
three creeks for £10,000, dispersed in the
distance.
About nine slept on the course, and in the
morning some had lost their boots and some
their hats, and some had bunged eyes and
disfigured faces. No water was to be had
in the vicinity, and twenty empty bottles
were eagerly clutched and inverted in the
hope of obtaining a reviver. That being a
failure, and the pub being ten miles away,
they started sorrowfully for the nearest
waterlioles on their divers ways home, in-
quiring vainly of each other as they went:
“Who won the big handicap?” They con-
cluded eventually that the secretary had won
everything.
EDWARD S. SORENSON.
Potter’s Debut.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT happened during the ’97 provincial
tour of the Stormer Dramatic Co.
Our trump card at that time was a
play called “Only an Honest Woman,” and
we were down to open with it at a pros-
perous cow-town next night. The aged and
leonine Stormer was in despair, as young
Barnley, who played the aged father with
whom Stormer, the penitent son, had his
last big scene, had fallen ill and would not
be able to work for a fortnight at least. He
was then lying in a cottage hospital 50
miles behind us while our “mixed” train
was jogging through the hills to Creamville.
At afternoon rehearsal in the Creamville
Mechanics’ Institute, Stormer looked round
in agony for someone to take Barnley’s
place, and finally fixed his eye on Potter.
Potter had gone on the stage because things
were dull in the building trade- —and that’s
just what his acting was like. But bad
times had thinned down the co. r and it was
a time and place for desperate experiments.
When Stormer had finally decided to take
the risk, he delivered over the part to Potter
with the co. drawn up in hollow square. He
adjured Potter to go away somewhere by
himself and endeavor to hammer the aged-
father’s remarks into his bricks-and-mortar
brain. He warned Potter that the success
or otherwise of the production hung on his
young shoulders, and also told him that his
whole future and a good deal of his present
depended on how he managed the scene.
Then, with a final threatening growl, he
tossed over the few tattered slips of paper
and dismissed him with a Henry V. gesture.
Potter seized his commission and rushed
out like a man going to a fire. More, he
disappeared completely from human ken
until one calendar hour before the curtain
was due to rise. It was just 7 o’clock when
Stormer found him crouching in a passage
reading by the glow of a dim and dusty gas-
jet.
“Well, d’ye know it?” hissed the Chief as
he passed.
Potter jabbed a stubby finger on the page
to mark the place and looked up. He was
haggard but elated. “Yes, I know every
word of it!" And, as a matter of fact, he
did know every word of it. He had spent
so much time and agony over it. that he
knew both parts—Stormer’s and his own -
and when the time came he proved it up to
the hilt.
The great homecoming scene . (it began
Act III.) had a sweet rural setting. When
the curtain rose the tottering old father
was discovered leaning on his stick outside
the cottage door while the villain whistled
as much like a bird as possible in the wings.
A young man’s voice was heard (“Yes, thank
you! I see where it is now!”) and Stormer,
in brown curly wig and English riding
clothes, strode on, started, removed his cap
and stood in a penitent attitude before the
disguised Potter. There'was a pause that
was just about a second too prolonged, but
which seemed like two years.. Then the
choking old father licked his lips and fired
off the first speeches of both in this fashion:
“At last, my boy, you have come back to
me! Yes, father, I have come back to you !”
Stormer closed his mouth with an effort of
will and repeated (his face meanwhile tied
into knots with rage) : “Yes, father, I have
come back to you!”
Potter, who was almost paralysed with
nervousness and hadn’t the remotest idea of
what he was doing, went straight ahead
again as soon as Stormer’s voice ceased:
“Have you found the world a sham, boy?
Yes, father, I have found the world an
empty sham. Can you find it in your heart
to forgive me?”
Stormer opened his mouth to say some of
it again and stop the sniggers of the audi-
ence. But Potter looked up, thought Stormer
had finished what he was about to say, and
started off again. “Aye, boy, I can find it
in my heart to forgive you. But, son, you
have not as yet told me any of your adven-
tures. Come, lad, sit down upon yon grassy
bank and gladden my old ears with the story
of your wanderings.” This was the cue for
Stormer’s pet speech, and, on the instant,
Stormer struck an attitude and with a bale-
ful eye fixed on the utterly disorganised and
unconscious Potter commenced: “Father!
The evening I left you sitting alone in the
sunset’s gentle glow, I”
Potter thought this was his cue, and
started to gabble the words in unison with
the apoplectic Stormer. The rest of the
scene went like this:—
Stormer (swallowing hard): “ sunset’s gentle
glow, I thought that I should soon see you
again!”
Potter (hurrying up) : “ thought that I should
soon see you again. Father, the way has
been 10ng”....
Stormer (nearly bursting with rage) : “Father, the
way has been long! My feet are sore!”
Potter (shaking his grey wig mournfully) : “Father,
the way has been long! My feet are sore. I
am wearied, and”
Stormer (in an enormous voice) : “My feet are sore !
lam wearied with long travel! But I will now
tell you the story of the last ten vears!
Alas!”
Potter (in a desperate hurry) : “But I will now tell
you the story of the last ten years! Alas! I
know”-
Stormer (abandoning the contest —yelling) : Shut
POtter (going ahead blindly) : “Alas! I know I
have erred, my father!” v r>TT
Stormer (deep purple by this time): Winn rou
SHUT —UP!” . '
Potter (pleadingly): “Forgive me, father! Forgive
me even as the father forgave the poor Prodigal
who had eaten husks with the swine, and
At this point Stormer waved both arms
above his head, and, just as his stage parent
reached the middle of the next sentence,
rushed at him, seized him in his arms and
wrestled him into the rain barrel at the
corner of the old home. The curtain fell just
in time to. prevent the serious-minded cow-
country audience from rushing the stage. As
it was, they stood and hooted Stormer for
fully twenty minutes, and several brawny
men who were making fortunes by overwork-
ing their own children called him a
cowardly young dog” and wanted to fight
him. They refused to leave until the facts
of the case were explained to about a dozen
of the largest and hairiest of them!
Because things were still dull in the build-
ing trade Potter took a job next day at the
local barber’s.
KODAK.
The Three Knocks.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN the owl that scared the mouse
Fluffed his feathers and sat still,
And the night around was chill,
On the door of yonder house
Someone knocked,
And a hand the door unlocked.
While the owl, aloof and drear,
Yellow-eyed his vigil kept,
Down the breeze a crying crept,
And it seemed to tell of fear —
Fear and care— •
It was Life that entered there !
When the owl had greyer grown
By a score of years and more,
On the selfsame cedar door
Of yon house that stands alone,
Someone knocked,
And a hand the door unlocked.
Yet, though many gracious flowers
Wreathed the house from floor to roof,
In his shadowed haunt aloof,
Staring sat he through the hours,
Unaware
It was Love that entered there!
When the owl had passed away,
And the mouse, no more afraid,
In the tree-glooms frisked and played,
On that door at end of day
Someone knocked.
And a hand the door unlocked.
Once and twice that knock had come,
Once for Life and once for Love ;
Towards the night the shadows move,
And the land lies still and dumb
Everywhere—
It is Death that enters there!
