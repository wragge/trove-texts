AYER’S HAIR VIGOR is unrivaled for
the restoration of faded and gray hair to its
original color and freshness, and for keeping
the scalp clean and healthy. The most popular
and elegant toilet preparation in the world, all
who use it, pronounce it, also, the best hair-
grower. When the capillary glands become en-
feebled by disease, age, or neglect, this dressing
imparts renewed life to the scalp, so that the
hair again assumes its original
Fullness and Beauty.
Ladies find that this preparation imparts to the
hair a silken pliancy and a delicate and lasting
fragrance. Gentlemen use it to prevent bald-
ness, to restore faded and gray hair to its former
color and abundance, and to relieve the scalp of
troublesome humors and dandruff. A proof of
the superiority of this preparation over all
others of the kind is the constantly-increasing
demand for it in all civilized countries.

ANY
WHO IS

fg
Nervous & Debilitated
Who in his youth has trifled away his vigour of body,
mind and manhood, should consult PROFESSOR
CARL STINEWAY, the Eminent Specialist,
in diseases of the Genito-Urinary Organs, who is
still treating with the greatest skill and success all
Private, Nervous and Chronic Diseases.
Professor STINE WAY'S success, which has
become so firmly established throughout Australasia,
is based upon the facts ist. That every case treated,
even in its most remote effects, is specially studied,
thus starting aright. 2nd. The Medicines used are
exactly adapted to suit the case, and are compounded
from the purest, freshest, and refined ingredients,
thus promptly producing results without overdosing
or injury.
I seek cases where all else has failed.
Young and middle-aged men and others, who
suffer from Nervous and Physical Debility,
Exhausted Vitality, Premature Decline, etc.,
can recover the same degree of health, strength,
and energy experienced in former years, by
consulting (in person or by letter, which is
free), Professor STINE WAV. who has re-
stored thousands of sufferers to vigorous man-
hood after all other treatment had failed. It
makes no difference what you have taken, or
who has failed to cure you. Cases that I accept
for treatment are quickly and permanently
cured.
DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS,
OR CLASS OF SYMPTOMS MEET YOUR
DISEASED CONDITION Are you a sufferer
from bad health in any of its many forms, consequent
on a lingering Nervous, Chronic, or Functional
Disease ? Do you feel nervous, debilitated, fretful,
timid, and lack the power of will and action ?
Are you subject to loss of memory ; have spells of
fainting; fullness of blood in the head; feel listless,
moping, unfit for business or pleasure, and subject to
fits of melancholy? Are your kidneys, stomach,
urinary organs, liver, or blood in a disordered con-
dition ? Do you suffer from Rheumatism, Neuralgia,
or other aches and pains ? Are you timid, nervous,
and forgetful with your mind continually dwelling on
the subject? Have you lost confidence in yourself,
,nd energy for business pursuits ? Are you subject
to restless nights, broken sleep, dreams, palpitation
of the heart, bashfulness, confusion of ideas, aversion
to society, dizziness in the head, dimness of sight,
pimples on the face and back, and other desponding
symptoms? If you are afflicted, why further neglect
your health or future happiness, when by a single con-
sultation (which costs nothing) you can be placed on
the way to health, strength, and vigour?
All correspondence held sacred. A speedy
and perfect, life cure is guaranteed in all cases
I undertake, where doubt exists the sufferer is
frankly informed.
Persons living at a distance who desire
treatment without delay can, by forwarding a
full description of their case and £l, receive
by return of post the medicines required.
Do not despair, even though all others have
failed in your case. No matter what your
complaint may be, call or smite —I will cure
you. If you are ill, do not delay IMy vast
experience enables me to guarantee a positive
cure in all cases undertaken. CONSUL-

(REGISTERED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD OF NEW SOUTH WALES),
Late House Surgeon to the Great Northern Hospital, Caledonian Road, London,
SPECIALIST in the Treatment of Diseases of the
Reproductive Organs and Nervous Complaints,
Du. PERRY was induced to publicly advertise himself as a
Specialist in this branch of the profession in consequence of the number
of persons suffering from diseases of this nature remaining mneured; and
this is not surprising, when it is remembered, in consequence of the
general dislike of the profession to undertake these cases, the public
health has suffered, because the majority of persons advertising to treat
these diseases, and calling themselves Doctors, Professors, etc.,
Are Neither the One nor the Other,
and exist chiefly because DULY QUALIFIED MEDICAL PRAC-
TITIONERS have not occupied the field.
Patients can, therefore, readily see the advantage of being treated
by a practitioner who has gone through a thorough Medical, Surgical and
Anatomical Training in the best hospitals ; and the Doctor argues that,
although it may be considered contrary to antiquated medical etiquette
to so advertise, yet he is promoting the usefulness and the dignity of
the profession more by searching out and relieving this class of disease,
than by leaving them severely alone to the care of men who, however good
their intentions, have neither the opportunities or advantages of a regular
medical training to become acquainted with the best methods of treating
these complex forms of disease.

Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-

Western Australia is a much richer colony than is

Professor Brown, of Victoria, who made a thorough
examination of the south-western portion of Western
Australia, states that not the other colonies only, hut
oven the people of Western Australia evidently do not
know how much there is waiting for development. He
saw thousands of acres in contiguous blocks of fine choco-
late lands, light clay loams, and peaty soils. He thinks
the important features of the district are its grand climate
and regular rainfall.

SATURDAY. AUGUST 2, 18S0,
Liquor and Law.
Teetotallers have waged so able and per-
sistent a crusade against the State sanction
of the traffic in alcoholic drinks, that the
(piestion involved ranks to-day among those
which constitute the first concern of national
politics. In the old world and the new the
question has commanded and commands
urgent attention, while here in Australia it
is vital, vigorous, an;l exacting of serious
consideration. These facts are creditable to
the pugnacity, perseverance, and argumen-
tative capacity of water-propagandists gener-
ally. There is merit in the cause itself, it
is true—and so much merit that if every
water-drinker in civilisation had been stricken
dumb twenty years ago a host of minds would
be to-day seriously engaged on the pro-
blem. But, notwithstanding, without teetotal
enthusiasm, teetotal arguments, and the
contumacious perseverance of the disciplined
and undisciplined battalions of the water-
cult, the popular mind and the general poli-
tical mind would still look upon proposals to
wholly suppress intoxicants by legislation as
the fanciful tilts of vino-phobiac Quixotes
astride of granite-fountain Rosinantes.
# # #
In reality, aggressive teetotallers have had,
and have, on the body social and political,
an analogous influence and effect' to those
which spirituous liquor has on the individual
consumer. They have, acting in their sphere,
quickened the pulse of the community, and
refined its perception of the evils associated
with drink. For centuries communities took
no note of their drink-bills. They attached
no odium to the excessive drinker merely
because he drank to excess. Early civilisa-
tion is a record of victorious achievements
crowned with the goblet, and of national
disasters whose bitterness it assuaged. Civili-
sation slept and dreamed through the long
Middle Ages, and all the time with the odour
>f wine on its breath and its generous fire
in its veins ; and when it arose and shook
itself and prepared to answer to modern
lemands, it marched forth to its task with
the vine-branch in one hand and the charter
of human rights in the other. Religious
festivities summed themselves up in the
ivine-eup, and visions of Walhalla revealed
the immortal gods engaged in divine con-
viviality.
# - # #
The conscience of the world was not yet
alive to the evils which intoxicants carry in
their train, and must have carried since the
first man drank to excess. No pictures of
shattered health, of blighted reputations, of
blasted prospects, arose before the mind.
No haggard mothers or starved and stunted
children met the gaze. Around the sparkling
juice of the grape lay an atmosphere in
which only prismatic lines of joy and
good - fellowship were discernible. This
atmosphere aggressive teetotallers pierced,
dispersed. The coarse crayon of untutored
earnestness drew the drunkard as a mur-
derer of wife and children ; the pencil and
brush of draughtsman and painter limned
iiim as the maker of paupers and material of
maniacs. The specti’al horrors stalked
around the banqueting-room, out into the
streets, and crowded the market places.
Observation showed with what terrible fre-
quency these ghastly apparitions were
materialised, and as the teetotaller invoked
aid the communal mind, excited, inflamed,
fell, or came near falling, under his spell,
# * *
But just as unlimited subjection to
spirituous liquors precipitates the individual
into physical drunkenness, so unlimited sub-
jection to this enthusiasm or any enthusiasm
precipitates to mental drunkenness. The
laws which, under the influence of this new
propaganda, banished intoxicants from
several of the States of America bear all the
characteristics of the products of drunken
minds. They were vitiated by suddenness,
barbarised by injustice, and stultified by
inconsequentiality. A day was enough to
set them up ; a day was enough in which to
knock them down. At one fell swoop they
deprived a man of a means of living which,
until the teetotallers hung their pictures
out, they and he had regarded as honest.
They drove nails into the doors of public-
houses and rejoiced as victors ; but the secret
distiller and the chemist carried on the
business in private houses or they swept
one ward or town clear of the traffic only to
make the contiguous places cess-pools for
both. This brings us to our moral : Some
teetotaller and some publican is good ; too
much teetotaller or too much publican is
bad. Without the teetotaller the world
would, as we have said, be still dull to many
of the evils of intemperance ; with him as
the rider, drunken minds will assume the
cure of drunken bodies, and intelligent
reform be retarded.
# # *
Drunkenness is no more in wine than is
gluttony in meat. The bibulant is attracted
by the wine-cup, the glutton by the steaming
joint. The excesses are human acts and to be
corrected, not by breaking the wine-cup, not
by penalising cooked joints, but by operating
on the capacity for restraint which adult
human beings, not devoid of reason, must
be assumed to possess. The man physically
drunk smashes unoffending tables and chairs ;
the man mentally drunk demands power to
smash the unoffending wine-glass. Where,
once complied with, is this mental inebriety
to stop ? Shall the vegetarian strive for a
majority to apply legal prohibition to beef-
eating ; shall the beef-eater similarly pro-
hibit the vegetarian ? Shall the athlete call
up a majority to destroy the books of the
recluse, and the recluse to burn the imple-
ments of the athlete ? Shall the smoker slay
the non-smoker with a majority, or the latter
the smoker ? Men have damaged health by
too much meat, by too much vegetables, by
too great an addition of sport or study, and
by too much tobacco. Of course the evils in
these cases are neither so widespread nor
intense, save in the case of over-eating when
viewed by the practised medical eye, but
evils ilv arise under them, and once the prin-
ciple of prohibiting by law the exercise of an
appetite which is moderate because other
appetites in the same line are immoderate, is
admitted, the duty of morally disciplining
the individual ceases in all directions, and
the vole of a Parliamentary or other majority
must be brought up and put in its place.
# * *
The evils arising from sexual passion are
more numerous and deadly than all other
evils taken together. Love, inordinate, ill-
regulated, has filled more charnel - houses
than all the red and white wine that ever
came from the winepress. Under its gaze
youth has staggered, dazed to a premature
grave, and age has gone blindly to dishonour.
Because in many cases Love is a road to ruin,
because in many cases marriage is a road to
fatal strife, who will advocate that love is to
be barred off and marriage made impossible?
But it is on such a principle that Local
Option and Prohibition rest. The right to
love, the right to marry, the right to eat, the
right to drink—-all are inalienable, and only
when trespassing upon one another or upon
the community they lose their character
and become wrongs can the function of
Government be properly or profitably brought
to bear on them.
* # #
The Drink traffic wants reform, but the
reform to be sound, to be lasting, must rest
on the maintenance, not on the deprivation,
of natural rights. The traffic is dangerous
and acts overtly and covertly on the welfare
of society. Society invokes, therefore, a
power to eliminate from the traffic
whatever leads in a direction contrary
to the duties of good citizenship. All
this it can do, and the traffic will still
survive. It can, for instance, increase the
license-fees and insist on spacious liars. The
first will make the holder of the license
regard forfeiture with terror, the second will
give a semi-public character to the perform-
ance of drinking, and many of the insidious
practices alleged to be at present current
will become thereby impossible. These two
reforms will, of themselves, bo sufficient to
root out the low dons where painted harri-
dans and soaked dupes play with one another’s
lives. And with this gained public decency
and national honour will be safer than after
a universal mutilation sanctioned by a
majority, ready, for a mere fad, to cut the
throat of personal liberty.
An Eight-Hours Bill.
Sir Samuel Griffith, in his other capacity as the
friend of toil, has introduced in the Queensland.
Assembly a Bill which ought to,, make his name
famous. The ostensible objects of this literary
effort are twofold ; in the first place it lays down
the axiom that eight hours ought to constitute a
day’s labour, and in the second it states that if it
does not do so the Legislature feels sorry for the
circumstance, but fails to see how it can help it.
The measure is not an enactment in the ordinary
sense of the term, for it doesn’t enact anything ;
and even if it is passed it cannot reasonably be
called a law, for it doesn’t require anybody to do
anything or to leave anything undone. Probably
it will be alluded to as an Act of Parliament; but
as it makes no pretence of acting in any way, the
name is a misnomer and a delusion. The Eight-
Hours’ Bill, in sirort, simply states that something
ought to be done, and makes no attempt to do it.
Sir Samuel himself describes it as a “ declaratory
measure,” and the description is about as accu-
rate as any mere earthly thing well can be;
for it declares in the first place that the em-
ployer ought to adopt a certain course, and in
■ the second that he can adopt it or not according
to how he feels on the subject. In this respect,
therefore, it declares twice as much as any
ordinary measure, and it is difficult to imagine
how any mortal ingenuity could well make it
declare more. It is crowded as full of declaration
as it can hold, and the same great natural law
which prevents a whale from getting into a jug or
an alligator from pushing itself through under a
keyhole, makes it impossible to insert any more—
there isn’t room for it. Still in one important
point it is all that its author’s fancy has painted
it. It is a fair, judicial and unbiassed measure
which does no harm to anybody. It legislates on
both sides of the question with equal impar-
tiality, and then abolishes itself, and stands out,
and leaves both parties to scramble for anything
they can get. It doesn’t interfere with the
liberty of the subject in any way. It simply
asserts its own existence, and tells everybody to
take no notice of it, and do as they darned well
please, and whichever faction comes uppermost
the Bill will fit the case.

It is a painful evidence of the innate cussedness
of Labour that tliis comprehensive measure has
been received with universal dissatisfaction. The
Bill is an elaborate statement of Sir Samuel’s
democratic sentiments, and it is with a look of
pained surprise that that eminent politician learns
that the country doesn’t care one solitary straw
for his sentiments so long as they do no good to
anyone but the owner. If Sir Samuel is of opinion
that the nation ought to have clothes, and yet the
nation hasn’t got them, the general idea is that
humanity will be just as naked as it was before,
and a Bill which practically states that the toiling
masses will be graciously permitted to do the best
they can, and that the State won’t hinder them if
it isn’t able to, is met by the uncourteous rejoinder
that the masses could do exactly the same thing
without any Bill at all. It is generously provided
that eight hours will be the limit of a day’s labour,
except when the employer arranges otherwise,
and unfortunately the employer invariably
arranges otherwise whenever he is in a position to
do so, and will keep up this habit till the end
of time. And yet it is on the strength of such
measures as this that Queensland’s exploded boss-
democrat has built his hollow reputation as a
Tribune of the People, and has successfully per-
suaded a large section of the nation that the
gilded dog-collar of St, Michael and St. George
is the emblem of liberty and national progress.
He has yearned all through his political career
over the troubles and sufferings of the poor, and
has always been on the verge of doing something
which was never done, and initiating some shape-
less, intangible reform which was to start in an
unspecified manner, and result in something that
was never very clearly defined. And the final
result of all these years of empty theory is, that
the people are to take anything they can get, and
get it anyhow they can, and if they get nothing
at all, the Tribune of the People will get there
just the same.
* # #
Still the democratic party in Queensland cannot
fairly denounce Sir Samuel Griffith as a rene-
gade from his ancient faith, for so far as the party
was concerned he never owned a faith, except in
theory. He has not gone back on his record for
he had no record at all. He is a species of hybrid
republican who would gladly fill the post of
monarch in a free commonwealth, and he longs to
promote an era of universal equality, so long as
there is a hereditary aristocracy in it, and a House
of Peers, and a privileged guild of lawyers,
and provided that all the ancient land-
marks are left standing, and no venerable prece-
dent is interfered with. Neither princes nor
K.C.M.G.s of princely manufacture are of any use
to the cause of Labour. Even the sixpence-worth
of base metal and old junk which forms the in-
signia of the cheapest order of knighthood on
earth is too much to sacrifice for any vague yearn-
ings after social regeneration. Probably the two
loftiest and most conservative beings in this world
are-the colonial knight, in all the glory of a decora-
tion which is inferior to a busted jam-tin both in
point of ornament and utility, and the plush-clad
flunkey who shines the plate of a British lord, and
to the knight and the flunkey alike the idea that
mankind was born free and equal is abhorrent.
The one feels that his decoration is at stake ; the
other dreads an upheaval which may rend from
him his livery and his unnaturally expansive calves
stuffed with sawdust. And as a natural result
the cause which pins its faith to either of these
two elevated individuals is apt, sooner or later, to
find itself left.

Probably the very meanness of the mongrel
patent of Australian nobility adds to the rampant
conservatism of the wearer. The dignity of a
corporal is generally a much more overwhelming
thing than that of a general, and the sergeant, as
a rule, throws his chest out at least two feet
further than the field-marshal, and looks by far
the more important animal of the two. No species
of nobility is too cheap or too mean to place a
gulf between its owner and the untitled multitude,
but the so-called democrat who goes back on his
creed for the sake of the lowest grade in the Order
of the Gilded Id'ot, is often further removed from
all sympathy with the cause of democracy than
the hereditary peer whose race has been of no use
to anybody since the Conquest. Even the lofty
exclusiveness of the House of Guise was a small
affair compared to that of the insurrectionary
nigger whom the Emperor Dkssalines, of Hayti,
glorified under the title of the Duke of Marma-
lade ; and this abject reverence for small dis-
tinctions links the K.C.M.G. and the head waiter
together, and binds them both to the principal
counter-jumper in the fashionable drapery ware-
house, and establishes an indissoluble bond of
brotherhood between the old family flunkey
and the colonial privy councillor twin
emblems of the smallest and most insign ifi.
cant of human dignities. The far-reachin
selfishness and grovel of humanity makes the
cause of Democracy principally the cause of those
who have nothing to lose, and whether the bogus
aristocrat stakes'the inexpensive degradation of
St. Michael and St. George, or hazards only a
suit of plush, he is prepared in either ease to see
the world in ruins before he will let go. Even the
possession of a gin-shop with a coal-shed behind is
sufficient in most cases to make the owner a ram-
pant defender of the rights of Proputty in all its
aspects, and many a bitter Conservative has no
better grounds for the faith that is in him than a
small annuity and the fact that a remote relative
of his family married a lord who kicked her after-
wards. And, therefore, if the Labour party of
Queensland finds 1 hat its ex-idol is only a
lawyer and a K.C.M.G. after all, it may
console itself with the reflection that it would
have been contrary to (iOOO years of human ex-
perience if he had proved to be anything else.
The old Saying, “ Put not your trust in Princes,”
was based on a knowledge of the fact that a prince
is generally a mean animal and of no account;
and a K.C.M.G., at the best, is only a thing that
a prince has manufactured, and usually a thing
he has dashed off in a hurry as being a matter of
no importance. And it is absurd to expect the
object created to be grander than the creator, even
if the creator hadn’t made it anyhow and then
shoved it out of the way because he was anxious
to go to the theatre, or to have an epileptic fit, or
to pursue some other of the favourite avocations
of royalty.
Two Alligators or One Alligator?
Once more an attempt is being made in New South
Wales to pass an Act amalgamating the two
branches of the legal profession. This time the
Bill has originated in the- Upper House, and for
once Salomons, Q.C., and ex-Judge Manning,
who usually disagree about everything on prin-
ciple, have joined forces to overthrow this demo-
cratic measure. There has been so much “law”
lately that everybody knows the difference between
the two branches of the legal profession. In con-
ducting a case it is the duty of the attorney to see
the witnesses, collect and sift their evidence, take
down their statements and make out a written
precis of the case, called a brief, which he hands to
the barrister ; the latter conducts the case in court,
examines and cross-examines witnesses, addresses
the jury, and argues any points of law that may
arise. The client has to pay both these parties,
# # *
The original practice in New South Wales was
to make no arbitrary division between legal prac-
titioners. If a client chose to do so, he could
have one man conduct his case right through. The
same man that saw the witnesses, and took their
statements, and knew the whole details of the
case, and with whom the client had personally
talked the matter oyer, could, if the client so
chose, conduct it in court. But that sort of thing
did not suit the Judges of later times. They
wanted to follow England, to create a “ Bar ” with
all its privileges, and its exclusiveness; so the
Judges, not the people nor the Legislature, mind
you, but the Judges, under some real or fancied
power given by the Act enabling them to make
rules for the conduct of business in court, made a
rule that from and after a certain time all cases,
big or little, must be conducted by a man with a
horsehair wig, instructed by another without any
wig, and that the public must, whether they like
it or not, employ two men to do the work of one.
They altered the old practice and introduced a
novelty for which the public had to pay the piper.
* * «
So that the present Bill is really an attempt to
return to the old order of things, and not an
innovation in any way. The Bill simply
asks that the public shall be allowed to
employ one man right through a cake, if
they, the public, choose to do so. And against
this very reasonable request, what arguments do
the opponents of the. Bill put forward ? Mainly
this —that the functions of barrister and attorney
are so different that no one man can properly at-
tend to both duties in working up a case. But
this argument only applies to large cases. Where
there are many witnesses to see, many documents
to peruse, and a lot of points of law to work up, it
is no doubt to the client’s own interest to employ
two men to manage the case. But surely this
should be left to the client's own discretion, and
the employment of two men where he only wishes
to employ one should not be forced upon him by
the court. It will be to his own loss if the
attorney mismanages the case. We repeat that
it is only in large cases that any necessity for the
employment of two men exists. There are hun-
dreds of mere debt actions tried every year which
any intelligent layman could conduct after a little
experience, but the barrister must have his fee in
these cases just as in the large ones. In cases
where a defence is entered solely to gain time, the
plaintiff has to add a barrister’s fee to the debt
which he is striving to collect, and which he will
in all probability never recover. The costs of the
simpler actions are thereby enormously increased,
and law and justice are made expensive luxuries to
the public.
# * *
As to the argument that if attorneys are allowed
to appear in Court they will mismanage cases and
waste the time of the Judge, there is nothing in
this contention. If any person, attorney or bar-
rister, mismanages cases he will soon have none
put in his hands, so that this evil will work its
own cure. As to delay, it is notorious that the
prevention of delay lies almost wholly in the
hands of the presiding Judge. That great Judge,
Sir James Martin, used to keep the Bar up to
their work. There was no waste of time in c ases
tried before him. An incompetent barrister would
put a laboured and intricate question to a witness
and the old man would break in with his sharp,
quick utterance, “No good asking him that, he
doesn't understand you.” And then he would put
to the witne : s the pith of the question himself in
about five words. Or if a barrister repeated him-
self— “ You-said-that-before-no-good-saying-it-
again.” If an irrelevant question was asked he
would blurt out, “Nothing to do with the case,
can’t ask him that.” Cases tried before him were
never delayed ; but, now-a-days, having some
miserably weak men on the Bench, the leading
barristers simply run riot over them, waste time
(whereby they earn refreshers), insult the Judge,
quarrel fiercely with each other, and spin a case
out over days and days. The remedy for delay is
in the Judge’s hands, and several cases lately in
Sydney have been notoriously spun out through
the Judge not keeping control of the counsel.
Without being on the spot we can on’y hazard a
guess, but we think that if any prom]it and de-
cisive official were hearing the Premier Permanent
Building Society prosecution it would have been
over long ago.
* * *
The two main arguments against amalgamation
are thus disposed of. There are a host of detail
arguments which are of amazing importance in
the eyes of the profession—for instance, whether
advocacy fees should be taxable, whether theadvo-


cate should be responsible to the client if he
neglected the case, and so forth. There is no
difficulty whatever in dealing with these details.
Make your lawyer one man, responsible for every-
thing he does or omits to do; make all his charges
taxable; and if you think the necessities of the
case demand it, and you have money enough,
employ two men—one to work up the case and one
to conduct it. Even if the amalgamation had no
effect in clxeapening big cases, it would certainly
cheapen small ones ; and even in big cases a man
would very likely prefer to have his case conducted
by the maix who had an intimate knowledge of it
from the start.
About two months ago a raid was made on the
trains entering Melbourne from the suburbs, and
in the course of three hours 150 individuals were
found travelling without tickets, and thereby per-
petrating a deliberate swindle on the country at
large. There were three clergymen among the
delinquents, a lawyer or two, and about a dozen
merchants and other business men, to say nothing
of sundry well-known ladies who showed signs of
tears and hysterics. Nothing followed. Nobody
was prosecuted. The credit of “sassiety” was at
stake and “sassiety”—which consists, when you
look at it closely, of the red-faced woman with
the dog, and the retired publican’s “missus,”
and the pawnbroker who flourished by ad-
vancing money on the shirt and the bed-
stead and became a “shindykit,” and the
person who floated the gold-mine which had no
gold in it, and the solicitor who hasn’t been
found out —no doubt managed to choke the matter
off. Consequently Melbourne was spared the
spectacle of a number of ladies well known at
Government House fainting about in a police-
court on a charge of attempting to swindle the
State out of three coppers, and the merchant
princes of Victoria did not roll up to explain why
they were ready to sink to wholesale lying and
prevarication on the off-chance of saving a shill-
ing. But an old man who embezzled a jug valued
at about ninepence promptly got three months.
This is a great country.

South Australia is considering the advisability
of making parsons eligible to serve as members of
Parliament. For our own part we see no reason
why they should not be eligible, except that we
want to know how the flock will get on while the
shepherd is away firing his old disused sermons at
his bleeding country, and introducing the left-off
hymn into his motion for adjournment ? Who is
to visit the widow and the fatherless when the
spiritual consoler is busy bringing in a Bill to
wallop the prisoner who won’t pray regularly in
gaol, or drafting a resolution to suppress anybody
who is found anywhere but at choir-practice after
10 p.m? Also, if the reverend legislator lives in
the country, and can’t get back in time for Sun-
day, who is to pound the reading-desk into unholy
smash, and bang the pulpit into shreds and
flinders while he tells how Balaam owned a mule
in the far East ? Who is to come down on the
sinner like countless loads of bricks if the apostle,
who,se voice ought to be lifted with a steam crane
owing to its unnatural dimensions, is away collect-
ing carnal honorarium and other unregenerate
perquisites of the flesh, and is arguing with the
ungodly about the remunerations of this transient
earth, and scrambling among the children of dark-
ness for railways and other fleeting things, all of
which is vanity ?

A MONEY-LENDER at Aschersleben (Germany) has
been fined £lOO, and sentenced to six months’ im-
prisonment and five years’ police surveillance, fox-
charging 180 per shent. on his little bill. The idea
isn’t a bad one, so far as it goes; but a more
sensible plan vvould have been to make him lend
his entire capital out oxx personal security at
per shent and to allow the borrower to assault
him if he refused to renew. Few things would
have a more saddening effect on the average
money-lender than a loan at 2i per cent., repay-
able at an indefinite date, the lender to stand the
price of the stamps. All of which reminds us of
the following, clipped from the report of an insol-
vency examination at Sydney the other day
Re Frances Amelia M‘Nab (a widow). The official
assignee called Abraham Abrahams, who was examined
by Mr. E. A. Smith. He was a partner of Morris Neu-
stadfc, named in the hill of sale dated August 21, 1889.
Of the first advance of £lOO only £7O was paid to the
bankrupt, £3O being kept back for interest. On August
27 £OO was advanced to pay off Isaac’s bill of sale, and
£23 was kept back for intei-est. He did not think it
necessary to state the amounts kept back for interest in
making a copy of the account to be produced in court.
On December 23 £BO was advanced, £4O of which was
kept back for interest. Bankrupt thus borrowed £BO, and
only got £4O of it. The item on December 20, £1 145.,
was a half-year’s premium for insuring Mrs, M'Nab’s life ;
ho got a policy for £2OO. On January 15 she made a pay-
ment of £l5, and he received another of £l5 on February
7 by letter from Murray Brothers, who were trustees for
Mrs. M‘Nab. The first he heard of the assignment was a
note from them, which letter he had destroyed. He saw
Mrs. M‘Nab, and asked her if she had signed any docu-
ment, and she said, “ None whatever.” His position was
a good one ; he could pay 40s. in the £.

One of the ablest contributions to the, Ibsen con-
troversy lately raging in Sydney is from the pen
of Rose de Boheme in the columns of the Sydney
Morn ino Herald, Dismissing the restraints
imposed by conventionality on thought—customs
out of which society will grow as surely as it has
out of narrower ones—the lady deals witlx the
question from the standpoint furnished by the
words of old Polonlus : “To thine ownself be
true,” and then, coinciding with his conclusive de-
duction, “and it must follow, as the night the day,
thou canst not then be false to any man, ” proceeds
to show that the desertion of husband and children
by wife and mother for spiritual reasons may be a
wholly unselfish, nay, a consciously self-sacrificial
act, and calculated in the ultimate to be highly
beneficial to all concerned and particularly to the
children. As she puts it;—
Ay, “ the children ” have proved the safety of many a
household, but they have, alas ! ofc proved its bane. We
nave all known parents kept together by children who
have learned to curse them ; we have known men and
women who, sacrificing their mutual repulsion for the
sake of the children, have drifted into a life of shame ; we
have known pure and true-hearted fathers and mothers,
manacled together for life, and tearing at their fetters till
the children learned to think of them with contempt ;
and, seeing all this, we may well pause ami ponder the
query; “ Was llo t Nora Helmbr justified by her
children?”
Prior to this the writer, gratefully acknowledging
the sympathetic discrimination ” with which the
question had been handled by men, denies them
any apprehension of the theory that Nora’s deser-
tion of her little ones may have been undertaken
with a view to their moral benefit as well as her
own. The inference to be drawn is plain : the sex,
none of whose members could correctly diagnose
the subtle promptings of a mother’s disinterested
love, is clearly incapable of such self-abnegating
acts. Unfortunately for feminine self-glorification,
this view of Nora’s conduct has already been
taken by some of her enthusiastic male sup-
porters, not only in print (vide D.T), but in
Private controversy. Within the sacred precincts
of this office the question was thoroughly threshed
out from this very standpoint by some ardent
Ibsenites many months ago. This little piece of,
shall we say sexegotism, is perhaps but a trifling
return for many slights levelled from the male
side, but nevertheless, like many other little
straws agitated by the breath of the women who
step out from among the “dumb, driven cattle”
of their sex, apparently signifies that, equality
assured, the banner bearing the motto “ Women’s
Rights ” will only be unfurled in order to unfold
one emblazoned with a new watchword
“Women’s Supremacy.’' That won’t happen in
sthe course of next week, however.

In the Universal Review, Tolstoi replies at
length to the critics of the “Kreutzer Sonata.”
Here are his propositions as summarised by the
Pall Mall. Gazette
1. That society tolerates, to the point of encouragement,
irregularity before marriage on the side of the man.
2. And, as a natural sequel, condones infidelity after
marriage.
3. Owing to the grossness of view on which these
practices are based, the birth of children has lost its
pristine significance.
4. Both the birth and education of children are subor-
dinated to the pleasure and convenience of the parents.
5. The fault lies with the idealisation of the material
side of love, which misleads and degrades the whole
human nature upon both sides. “ Love ” (that is, passion)
“and all the slates which accompany it and follow it,
however we may try in prose and verse to prove the con-
trary, never do, and never can, facilitate the attainment of
any aim worthy of men, but always make it more
difficult.”
There is much truth in all this, in fact nothing
that is not, speaking relatively, true, but in
Tolstoi’s deductions that monasticism is the only
pure bodily state, and that science and religion
are botli against the perpetuation of the race,
none but the mystic pessimists will be found to
agree with him.

The big daily newspapers were published again in
Melbourne on cablegram Sabbath —and thus
was committed a flagrant breach of the
law recently devised and instituted to crush
Bailey’s proposed Sunday Times ; but as
tlie offenders are rich and “ respectable, ” not to
say powerful, of course nobody will be prosecuted
by a Government which simply dare not declare
war against the Age and Argus, and which deli-
berately passed a Bill to crush a man who was
about to interfere with the dailies’ monopoly by
publishing a Sunday paper. There is thus in SNc.-
toria one law for Boss Stme and Wilson and Mac-
kinnon, and quite another law for the —er —un-
authorised organs of opinion. Such a state of
affairs is filthily indecent in view of the fact that if
the Age and Argus chose to suddenly round upon
Premier Gillies and his shady political gang the
latter wonld give up the ghost within a fortnight.
All these things help on the Liberation movement.
The minority, which some people fancy are the
majority, make a rush for the Sunday papers out
of mere spite, and a Bulletin man heard one little
newsboy say lie had made 18 shillings during the
day. Bailey will be round again when the
Library is open.
Words of wisdom from the Belfast (Ireland)
Morning News :
We are not over sanguine as to the possibility of
establishing a community of interests , between an old
country which has a weakness for coercive legislation and
young nationalities that are too honest and too brave to
have recourse to handcuffs and muzzles. Between Great
Britain’s old blue-blooded classes and the newer world’s
industrial masses the difficulties of partnership must be
almost insurmountable. Wealth only exists when the
working world creates it, and partnership between the
idle classes and the industrial masses must resolve itself
into the robbery or the starvation of one or other of the
two parties concerned. Hitherto we have had the rob-
bery and semi-starvation of labour, and should justice be
enforced in the future we shall see the reverse of the old
position. George Washington and his friends must have
understood this questionable community of interests and
federation idea pretty fairly when they elected for a free
hand at home and a strong arm to uphold it.

When Adam Linsday Gordon wrote—
No game was ever yet worth a rap
For a rational man to play,
Into which no accident, no mishap,
Could possibly find its way,
that gifted poet and steeplechase-rider didn’t
imagine that he was preparing a stock quotation
for the “sporting” drivellers of future genera-
tions. At this season of the year, when the in-
trepid “knight of the pigskin” (another ghastly
and indestructible gag) is breaking his neck more
than usual, Gordon’s jingle haunts us like our
shadow. The racing prophet works it into his
ruinous column of productions; the Special
Commissioner, or somebody, uses it to re-
lieve the dull monotony of his chestnut
“comments”; even the tout evinces a maudlin
desire to sling that bit of poetry among his
graphic, but utterly erroneous, descriptions of
morning gallops. In every obituary notice of a
steeplechase victim, human or otherwise, the sup-
position that “No game was ever yet,” &e., is
repeated. It has become a public nuisance and
an everlasting curse. It is the chief corner-stone
of a degraded sporting literature, and the constant
associate of disgusting grammar. Moreover, the
verse in question cannot claim even the prosaic
merit of truth. There is no danger to life or limb
in a regatta or a Sheffield handicap. Skittles is a
distinctly harmless sport, nor has any man ever
smashed his collar-bone at billiards, a game which,
when played under wholesome conditions, can do
more for brain and body than any other under the
sun. We respectfully move that Gordon’s too,
too familiar rhyme be warned off sporting papers
for 12 months.

Lawyer Tozer (Q.) should speak for himself, and
not set himself up as the political godfather of all
the Australian N atives, as he did in the recent
Parliamentary Federation debate. “Any desire
to separate from the Crown of Great Britain,”
said Tozer, “ is furthest from our thoughts. . .
We (the A. N.) never wish to be Separated from
the Crown of England, which was the origin of
these colonies, until in the process of time, by the
development of these colonies, the Crown of Eng-
land will see that it is to its advantage that Aus-
tralia should become a nation.” Australians, on
the contrary, desire to become a separate nation
as soon as ever they find it to their advantage to
realise and proclaim their nationhood. The crimes
of the Crown produced such a superabundance of
criminals that there was scarcely either food or
foothold for them in the old country, and then
“the Crown” transported those criminals to
Botany Bay. Australian natives are not op-
pressed with gratitude to the Crown for its having
been, in this sense, “ the origin of these colonies.”
Roses have grown on England’s dungheap just as,
by the alchemy of nature, sweet violeto might
spring from the dead leper’s breast.
The Melbourne Telegraph thus sums up Bierre
Douar, who lately suicided in Pentridge owing to
too much chains and “solitary ” ;—“Thedeceased
convict was believed to have been sent from
France to New Caledonia in 1880. What his
offence was the authorities here do not know. It
is sure to have been something desperate if not
oomplicatedly horrible. The extreme atrocity of
French cut-throats is proverbial.” Just so. The
organ of piety and Christian charity doesn’t know
what the offence was, and only “believes” that
Douar was in New Caledonia at all, but it is
quite sure that he was a cut-throat, and is
positive that he did something “ complicatedly
horrible.” And yet if the editor of the Tele-
graij h had lived in England some 80 short years
ago he might have been sent out in chains to
Botany Bay because lie wanted local self-govern-
or some other little trifle, and then another
man would be editing the Telegraph to-day, and
he would probably feel sure that Editor Fitchett
had strychnined his mother or hammered a long
nail into his wife’s head, because he had no evi-
dence to prove that the person who came out with
his head shaved in that bygone era had really done
anything at all. If a thing which possibly never
happened is a certain proof that the man whom it
probably never happened to, is a ruffian of the
deepest dye, then both Christianity and logic are
in a bad way.
The N.S.W. Typographical Union, after devoting
a night to the discussion of the subject, has with
much enthusiasm rejected a resolution in favour
of the, admission of female compositors to its
ranks. Mr. Fitzgerald, the mover, argued that
unless the women were permitted to work in har-
mony with the men, they would be driven to work
in non-union offices at lower wages, to the detri-
ment of their brother-compositors, and added that
a woman had every right to compete fairly with
a man in order to gain an honest living. Another
speaker pointed out that women took part in the
international typographical congresses in America,
and that they could not be kept out of the trade,
in which, he added, they did not stay long. Mr.
Watson said that female labour meant cheap
labour, that the printing-trade was too unhealthy
for women, for whom there were other avenues
of employment such as domestic service—a rather
cheeky remark, be it observed, considering that a
woman-compositor must have education whereas a
domestic servant who does not know “ b ” from a
bull’s foot commands as good pay as a servant who
can criticise the Young Ladies’ Journal. As to
the chivalric statement on the part of the male
compositors that the printing-trade is too un-
healthy for women—an objection, by the way,
which only applies in any special degree to
night-work in badly-arranged offices—we are
afraid the Union doth protest too much.
The final conclusion arrived at by the meeting—■
“That the employment of female labour in the
printing trade is opposed to the best interests of
this society”—contains a strong smack of con-
fessed selfishness. The Bulletin, as a journal
which has always supported trades-unionism, and
means to do so, while it is, as now, an absolute
necessity, takes the liberty of pointing out
that the Union’s course of action is fraught
with much danger. Suppose that some printing-
office began to employ qualified female composi-
tors, paying them on results at the same rates as
men, and the_ Union delared war against that
office, the Union would be beaten hands down.
For the labour federation would be divided on the
question, and-the women could make an irresist-
ible appeal for support to the general public. As
matters stand now, the refusal of the Union to
admit women only offers a premium to “rat”
employers to employ women and lower the stan-
dard wage.
Odds and Ends.
How is it that the Archbishop of Canter-
bury still exercises spiritual jurisdiction in
Australia? When a bishop has been duly elected
by the Diocesan Synod in Sydney, why can he not
be consecrated by one of the resident Australian
bishops as soon as he arrives, and enter on the
duties of his office immediately afterwards ? That
simple course, it seems—simply because it would
be too simple—is not possible. The bishop can
only be consecrated by the Archbishop of Canter-
bury, and that individual cannot proceed with the
business until he has obtained a license from the
Queen. But what lias the Queen, or the Arch-
bishop, got to do with ecclesiastical affairs? When
State Aid to Religion was abolished here years ago,
the old connection between the State and the Church
was abolished with it, and the two things fell
completely asunder. The Anglican Church is as
independent of the local and Imperial Govern-
ments as any of the dissenting churches ; it might
elect any of its own churchmen a bishop whenever
it pleases ; and if it can elect, why can it not con-
secrate ? The present practice is just as absurd as
if the British War Office were to obtain the
privilege of nominating the Major-General of our
Volunteers.

It is a curious fact that the eternal mar-
riage question should have become a popular topic
of discussion, not only in Australia, but in Eng-
land and Europe generally, during the present
year. A tidal-wave of conjugal excitement seems
to have swept over the minds of men and women
in many different parts of the world at the same
time. The newspapers and magasfines are loaded
with articles and correspondence on different
phases of the subject; every clause in a new
divorce bill is argued from every possible point of
view—religious and political, sensible and non-
sensical-while a new play, in which the whole
interest of the plot centres iff a novel development
of the relation between husband and wife, attracts
as many disputants as the question of Hamlet’s
madness. Ibsen’s play has added a new character
to the drama, in the shape of “ the ideal husband,”
the moral of it being that a wife is justified in
deserting her mate (and three children) as soon as
she finds that he is deficient in moral tone,
(esthetic susceptibility, or any other gaudy virtue
with which her youthful imagination may have
clothed his spiritual nakedness. This idea seems
to have captivated nearly all the married women
who have seen the play, probably because it was
a new revelation to nine-tenths of them that a
husband could have any spirituality about him.
Imagine the effect of it on a tradesman’s wife, who
lias been sanding the sugar, or selling short weight,
for years in order to put money in her husband’s
pocket unknown. The “guilty creature, sitting
at the play,” would begin to,speculate in her own
mind as to how she would act in the event of her
man turning round and abusing her the moment
she was found out.
* * *
Count Tolstoi, the Russian novelist, has
also worked out the ideal marriage question in his
latest novel, “The Kreutzer Sonata,” with such
remarkable effect that an American lady, who
was asked to translate the book into English, de-
clined the honour, on the ground that she had
never read anything like it in her life, and hoped
she never would again. Tolstoi undertakes to settle
the whole problem of several relations on a puiely
philosophic basis ; and the ground he goes upon is
that all romantic love, as he calls it—that is, love
in which the physical feeling is predominant—is a
fatal mistake, certain to involve both parties in
misery; the only love that can be warranted to
last being that which is “born of identity of senti-
ment, similarity of ideal, the friendship of the
sort.” This theory is calculated to create uneasy
sensations in the minds of all , young ladies and
gentlemen who believe in love at first sight as the
only correct card for the maiden stakes. What
will they say to this?-'“Our system that is,
our fashionable system—“is the worst possible,
and the whole of our wedding ceremonial—the
honeymoon, the feasting, and the incitement to
carnality, are directly calculated to result in the
depravation of matrimony. Not in one case out
of a hundred does romantic love result in life-long
happy union. It is like opium or hasheesh—the
sensation is overpowering and delightful; but it
passes. ” So the Count proposes to eliminate all
admiration of face and figure from future flirta-
tions, and to confine the delicious sentiment to an
interchange of ideas on the latest fashions or the
last new novel; and provided that opinions on
those subjects are found to coincide, an unroman-
tic marriage may be safely contracted.
* # #
One of the most sensible things ever said
about marriage will be found in “Lord Mel-
bourne’s Papers,” recently published. His lord-
ship’s perception was acute in all things, but on
this subject it was particularly sharpened by his
own experience. “ Before marriage the shape, the
figure, the complexion, carry all before them;
after marriage, the mind and character unex-
claim their share, and that the largest,
of importance. ” If it were possible to reverse this
arrangement, the Divorce-courts might be shut
up; but iiow is it to be done ? It will never
be done until wo adopt Dr. Johnsbn’s idea when
he,said that if any young people who wished to
marry were to go before a judge and stand a cross-
examination as to their suitability to each other,
he would be a much better judge of the subject
than they could be.

Sir George Bowen tells some good stories
in the two volumes of memoirs which he has
recently given to the world. About the best is
one of Admiral Gore Jones, whom he met at
Mauritius —the only admiral he ever knew who
could quote “Homer” and “Virgil.” “He told
me that he was the first-lieutenant of a ship which,
shortly before the Crimean War, took the kite
Lord Carlisle from Constantinople to Rhodes, and
that he happened to be on watch early one morn-
ing just as he was passing Tenedos. Lord Carlisle
came on deck and asked : ‘ What island is that ?’
when Gore Jones answered : ‘ Tenedos, my Lord,
the island of Apollo; you recollect Homer says
of that god that he was ‘ ruler of Tenedos ’
(quoting the original Greek). The admiral says
that Lord Carlisle staggered back and almost fell
down the companion-ladder, saying, in a low, awe-
struck voice : ‘Sir, you are the first naval officer I
ever heard quoting Greek ! 1 did not know such
a thing was possible !’ ”
But there is one well-authenticated story
which Bowen does not tell his readers. When the
Civil Service of Victoria was being decimated by
Graham Berry under his authority, the socially
astute and courtly gentleman with the wicked eyes,
who then held the office of Chief Commissioner of
Police, received an early intimation from a Mel-
bourne Club friend- that his name was on the list
of the doomed. Early next morning he presented
himself at Government House and, having been
received by Sir George with the usual blarney,
proceeded to state his business. - The effect of it
was that unless his name was immediately removed
from the black-list, he would publish a lively
chronicle of His Excellency’s after-office-hour
amusements in Melbourne. The Commissioner
retained his post.
A monument to gentle Richard Jefferies
is to be placed in Salisbury Cathedral. It will be
executed by Miss Thomas, an Australian artist,
who received her lirst training in Melbourne,
under Summers.
Dear Bulletin, —An official report from the
expensive pen of Chief Commissioner Speight
has ruthlessly burst up the respectable fiction
that the Victorian Railways were “paying.”
Of recent years it has been customary with
Duncan Gillies to wave las fat political
paw in the direction of the nearest engine
and request the country at large to heap blessings
on his head for maintaining a system which was
innocently supposed to be run on the strictest com-
mercial principles, as commercial principles are
understood by a public which buys candles
at threepence farthing and sells them atfourpence
halfpenny. Speight, again, would greedily
drink in the cheers of the assembled banqueters
when he stood up to announce that the commis-
sioners, regardless of parliamentary intrigues
and insidious back - stairs influences, were
pledged to make the railways pay. Daily
newspapers greeted the issue of each fresh
loan with a complacent snuffle on the subject of
reproductive works in the direction of new lines.
The periodical recurrence of accidents, followed
by gorgeous grants to the widows and the father-
less—not to mention the city gentlemen whose silk
hats and self-composure had been damaged in the
collision —were regarded as mere spots upon the
genial sun of railway profits. The bubble lasted
much longer than Gillies’ mythical Budget sur-
plus, which was pricked in the very infancy
of its prismatic splendour. In fact, the
annual profits on the Victorian railway traffic
had become almost an integral portion of the
colony’s swelling prosperity when Speight
issued his report. “It is not possible under the
present policy of railway construction for the net
revenue from railways to meet the interest on the
loan-moneys expended.” In a lightsome, ex-
hilarating spirit the report goes on to prattle
about the “prospective value” of the con-
cern, and to suggest that the due payment of
interest on capital from profits on business may
be held over until such profits are real in-
stead of bogus. Meanwhile, the glorious
reproductive future of the “system” is
pegging backwards a lot faster than the
years x’oll on. In 1880 there was not a poli-
tician or engine-greaser in Victoria who didn’t
bulge out with patriotic pride at the thought of
what the railways would be doing in ten years’
time. At the very lowest estimate they were to
be returning eight per cent, interest on the invest-
ment. It unfortunately happened, however, that
in those ten years the proportion of gross receipts
swallowed up by working expenses has risen
exactly eight per cent., and the nett earnings on
capital expended have practically decreased. The
inevitable result of which has been a sinful raising
of the commissioners’ salaries and a steady growth
of cussedness on the condition of the noble army
of porters. -F.E. [As the primary object of all
communal institutions is ncff the realisation of
profit, but the increase of the community's comfort,
so long as State money is not absolutely frittered
away, the failure of the. Victorian railways to pay
a dividend is not a cause for national sorrow.
Profits thus reaped, simply mean the passing of
money from one pocket to another, —Ed. B.]

My Dear Moorabixda,—
That ultra-Cohservative institution, Sydney University*
is developing an intensely Radical yearning to see how its
doings look in print that would make the old dons rustle in
their shrouds. The latest amendments (moved and carried by
Mr. Teece and Professor Gurney) are that copies of each
prize poem or essay be sent to the editors of the “ leading ”
(meaning Conservative) Sydney newspapers, and that
copies of the said literary efforts shall be printed for
publication—the ’Varsity to “ stand Sam,” as the bad boys
say. In other words, the poems are to appear as adver-
tisements. To which Sappho subscribes her gracious
approval. Who knows what gems of thought hav e been
wasted on an aggregate of bored pundits, tired to death
with pronouncing on the merits of miles of screed,
and grunting superciliously over even the prize-
copy? The disheartened though victorious grad, up
to the present has meekly received his medal and MSS.,
probably pawning the first and giving the latter to
his best girl who curled her front hair with it and
was happy, and there the matter lapsed, as the lawyers
say. Now the prize-writings will be immortalised, and
even although graduate prize poetry is of the “And here
the proud Ulysses laughed aloud ” order, and the prose a
swell of polished periods where there isn’t a word under
three syllables long and an idea less than 800 years old-
still the budding savant has his moments—and even if he
does get preserved for no adequate literary reason his
inspiration will come in handy to wrap up the butter of a
(nocking posterity. So far as I have been able to ascertain
the verse with the poetry in it does not come from the
University so often as it comes from tire son of the
washerwoman who lives at Jamheroo—or from the boy
who was brought up on a selection and can’t spell.
In honour of Sir Charles and Lady Halle, Sydney Lieder-
tafel issued cards for a conversazione in the Town Hall
vestibule on 24th ult., when a large, cold aggregate
arrived and occupied themselves in dodging the able
bodied zephyrs that blew on every side from 8 p in. till nine
o’clock, at which time the guests of the evening dropped
into the arm-chairs provided'for them, and the business
began. The Liedertafel, Miss Saville, Mrs. Vanderveer
Greene, Kowalski, and Lemmone (it was significant that
ho local fiddler turned up to ply the bow for Lady Halle’s
edification)—all did their best with their locks blown on
end and a devastating echo making havoc of their
top notes. Lady Hall 6 wore a scarlet cloak lined
with ermine, her gown being of black velvet, laced up the
back and relieved with maize and jet; black plume Ran
diamonds. Mayoress Burdekin’s dress was black net lace
draped over ecru satin, diamond ornaments and white wrap;
Mrs. Vanderveer Green (who received a lovely basket of
flowers after singing in liquid tones, “My heart and thy
sweet voipe ”) wore white satin and gold-spangled gauze
capote of pink roses ; Miss Saville (the recipient of two
bouquets) wore a pansy-blossom costume in, yellow satin
and crystal net; Miss Broomfield, cream silk and emerald-
green velvet bows; Mrs. Daniells, yellow satin and
Maltese lace ; while a lady created a mild sensation in a
scarlet satin tea-gown with Watteau train and voluminous
folds of coarse lace and a large, red feather as a peri-
cranial improvement ! Excellent refreshments were set
out in the Mayor’s room at the conclusion of the concert,
“ after which the proceedings were of a social character.”
The Liedertafel’s own little efforts were greatly appre-
ciated, and if only the tenors weren’t overbalanced by the
other voices the society would leave nothing to be desired
vocally.
Angry anti-Ibsemtes ana exalted ultra-Ibsenites (by the
by, some nasty people call them “ obscenitcs ”) wage a
war in the dailies over the moral issues touched upon in a
“ Doll’s House,” and a lady ably spreads herself over a lot
ofS.M. Herald space to show that Nora only did what
every ideal married woman yearns to do every day. But
yours very truly is of opinion that, to the typical
female, bound about by a cherished conventionality,
“appearances ” arc a lot dearer than morals, and even if
she had insight enough to discover that her husband was
a metaphysical alien to her, that wouldn’t worry her very
deeply so long as society knew their union was strictly
legal, whereas she would revolt from a socially-illcgal
union with a man whose thoughts were her’s. Ibsenites
argue frantically against conventionality as being woman’s
chiefest manacle ; but who forges the fetters fastest—men
or women? Mrs. Grundy is a female who finds her chief
joy in setting up high social hurdles that bring you a
damaging social cropper if you can’t clear without tap-
ping ; and if you insist upon taking away her obstacles,
you might as well do away with herself. Put a woman in
a world where “ How very improper !” was an obsolete
expression, and she would wither and wilt in a fortnight;
and a tea-swilling female confronted with a brand-new
social condition under which pretty Mrs. A could leave Mr.
A. at any moment for the most improvable reason, and
give rise to no blighting scandal, would burst on the pre-
mises from corked-up innuendo And as to whether
woman are dominated by then yearning soulfulness,
possibly not one she in a million acts on spiritual impulse
after she is 20 and begins to see a glimmer of the hard
realities of life. Ibsen makes Nora a girl probably be-
cause he knew that after girlhood the average lantern-
jawed, hdugry-eyed woman wouldn’t care a snap about
George’s mental attitude so long us she kept a maid and
had a maximum of bonnets per annum—simply because
she prefers three meals a day in the hand to an unspecified
number of hungry outcast exalted up-reachings in the bush
—and small blame to her either. Ibsen’s theories may be
put into practice by women who gain materially in
shunting the “old man”—that is, after the old man
doesn’t exert his authority and chain her up to the bed-
post as she is about to take a theatrical farewell, but that
the wage-earning Benedict may not fear such a dereliction
of wifely duty, Sappho will wager a hat. By the way.
what a field it opens up for the latter-day Phryne who
could conveniently discover that “spiritual union” was
impossible with No. 1, and then reach out smilingly (or
another alter ego !
It rained assorted animals on the evening of 26th inst.,
when the joyous “ Paul Jones ” was romped through under
the critical eyes of Lord and Lady Carington, Miss Walenn
and Oapt. Davis, R.N., with Brother Rupert and Capt.
Helbert to keep the draught off them at the back. Lady
Carington was charming in a bodice and train of ruby
satin brocaded in grey, the jupe being composed of soft
cream lace, which also formed the sleeves, front and neck
folds of the low bodice—the sleeves reaching to the elbow
and caught across with bands of the brocade; a pearl
necklet with a diamond clasp, diamond brooches, bangles
and aigrettes - the latter appearing in the becoming head-
dress of ruby Velvet, with a large tarantula bow on the
left side—white gloves and a gauze fan. The managerial
bouquet was wisely chosen in pale neutral tints—
always safe when the colour of the gown is not known.
“ Paul Jones ” improves with age, and Our Nellie (who
now wears a ripping black and pink gown in the last act)
dances her pas se'ul with a vigour that reveals the full
secret of the “biff ” underskirt even to the last row of
Hie circle, who snatch at their glasses and don’t know what
to t hink of it. And in the ballet, in act two, when those
spidery danseuses—all sadly lacking in the bran and saw-
dust of artifice—flop backwards on one shank with the
other straight out behind like a railway signal, their
adorers in the stage-boxes have to shrink against the wall
while the pink and blue satin slippers jerk wildly within a
hair of their noses. Nobody seems to mind, however.
At the Athenaeum Club dinner to Sir Charles Halid, the
other day, the inspired litterateur who evolved the menu
spelled rotis —“ rots.” It was thereupon unanimously
decided that faultless fact is an uncalled-for virtue on a
hill of fare.
A successful children’s dance was presided over by Miss
Ruperta Carington at Government House on her birthday
(24th ult.), when the festivities commenced at the wise
hour of half-past four. Professor Anderson gave a con-
juring exhibition in the ball-room, which was beautifully
decorated, after which a rekerky “ tea” was partaken of,
followed by dancing—the three little hostesses joining in
the Spanish and other dances with the enthusiasm which
is a refreshing feature in the vice-regal infants—who
were all frocked alike in dainty white gowns and blue
sashes.
A very quiet wedding—quiet probably on account of
the difference of creed between the high contracting
parties—was that of Miss Lilian Salomons, eldest daughter
of Mr. Julian Salomons, Q.C., of “ Sherbourne,” Wool-
lahra, and Mr. George Simpson, only son of Attorney-
General Simpson, of Sydney, which took place on 18th
July at St. Mark’s, Darling Point. The bride wore a
dainty walking dress of white camel’s hair cloth and rep
silk with hat en suite, and carried a charming posy of
white roses, snowdrops, violets, and maiden-hair tied with
broad satin ribbons. She had only two bridesmaids.
A small civic function took place behind Sydney Town
Hall on 24th ultimo, when Mayoress Burdekm made a
few pats at the foundation-stone of the new electric-light
engine-house, which .is to he quite an edifice, and is to
cost the tired taxpayers £4150. Mrs. Burdekin wore a
perfectly charming gown in mignonette-green Russell
cord, with panel designed in large green velvet arum lily
leaves; the designed material appearing on the bodice
in a kind of Zouave outlined in dark green silk tiny pom.
poms which also depended from the cuffs. Empire cravat
in tan Maltese lace and bonnet in (awn and copper-red
velvet with autumn leaves and crocus-buds, parasol in
fawn crepe lisse—which rather spoiled the ensemble to my
opinion. There were a number of other smart costumes.
After the sorrowful ceremony (and the laying of founda-
tion-stones always gives me the jumps—you see the
papers and coins buried in the presence of living people
who will be mouldering skeletons long ere the disinter-
ment of the hidden records) the guests climbed up to the
Mayor’s room, where refreshments were served, under the
benign influence of Town Clerk Daniels. In the afternoon
Mrs. Burdekin opened the Dog Show at the Exhibition.
At the crowded Hall 6 morning concert on 23rd ult., the
most notable feature was the shrill squeal of the dis-
appointed matinee fiend relieving her feelings on the
steps by reiterating a crescendo intention of “getting her
money back ”—a harsh material objection that didn’t fit
in with the opening arpeggios of the “ Moonlight" sonata.
Lady Carington wore shot bronze and pink silk with
folded bodice with braces and ridged sleeves of bronze
velvet, bonnet in gold straw with bronze velvet bows,
wings and blush roses; the three children were in white
frocks, pink sashes, and drawn brown silk hats.
Snazelle was resplendent in a curry-coloured get-up
reminiscent of a mild bilious attack, and a charming
creature was confident in a gas-green garment, buttercup
boots and a red sunshade. Lady Hal 16 wore an artistic
tea-gown in ash-grey chiffon, the demi-trained skirt in
accordeon pleats and broidered with a band of dark-grey
velvet design; the stole front and flowing sleeves in the
chiffon; Zouave and sleevelets in grey velvet cut in
turrets at the back and broidered in gold; the fronts
designed in gold; two long ends of grey figured ribbon
depending from the waist in front, grey shoes and
diamond ornaments. I think the chiffon sleeves of
this dress were a mistake viewed from a musical stand-
point—they waved in a distracting manner on to the
bridge of the violin and took one’s eye off the melody, so
to speak—thus jerked her audience back from Mozart to
millinery. theconcert was a symmetrical
success.
The Hall 6 farewell matinee concert at the Centenary
Hall on 28th inst. was attended by the same old throng
with nothing special on, and the same stereotyped expres-
sion of rapture interjected in the wrong place. Lady
Carington arrived rather late, attended by brother Rupert
and Miss Walenn, and was arrayed in light sage-green
cashmere, with basque bodice and sleeves covered with
close patterned black lace, pleated vest and revers ter-
minating at the shoulder in perky epaulettes in the green,
yellow gloves, a dainty bonnet in dark-green velvet add
ivy leaves and a dark-brown velvet mantollete edged with
brown fur. Ecru muslin and lace with crescendo of
crepe lisse and diamond bangles and rings was Neruda’s
airy attire on a day that chilled the marrow in one’s bones.
At the commencement of the second part a nervous gen-
tleman, with elephant’s-breath-coloured hair, appeared
on the stage and presented Lady Halid with a silver lyre-
bird with a gold-and-silver tail, roosting on a mahogany
pedestal which bore the usual cofflnish inscription, all of
which was a “ gift from a few of the—hum—professional
musicians of Sydney or—ah—as a token of their—ahem—
esteem . . . superb talent . . . advantage of
hearing you,” &c., at which outburst of professional
enthusiasm Lady Hall 6 blushed like a school-girl, but
unfortunately did not inform the company that she was
“ too overwhelmed to thank them ” in good, old, sobbing-
tones —probably because that was about how she really
did feel. The llall6s left for Melbourne by express on
29th ult.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
We are requested to announce that the marriage of Miss
Bttie Love, of Beulah, Kirribilli Point, with Mr. J. T.
Isles, eldest surviving son of Mr. J. Isles, of Finney, Isles
and Co., Brisbane, will take place in Sydney durihg
October.
The marriage of Miss “ Flossie” Devlin, of Clovelly, Ash-
field, with Mr. “ Bob ” Hogg, of Melbourne, took place
at St. John’s, Ashfleld, on •22nd ult. The bride sensibly
eschewed the orthodox chalky get-up, and wore a fawn
brocade and Brussels lace gown with Medici collar in white
ostrich feathers, diamond ornaments and bridal bouquet
(from Melbourne) of white and yellow. The four brides-
maids wore white and yellow," with tiny bonnets and
bouquets of buttercups; and the gown worn by Mrs.
Devlin in grey and primrose brocade and armure was ex-
ceedingly handsome. The bride’s travelling dress was
grey cloth, with bat to match.
Lady Carington presided at a meeting of the N.S.W*
Women’s College committee on ISth July, Held in the
Town Hall. The latest paid-up total is ,11099 12s. 3d.
There was a large attendance.
Sydney Suburban Bicycle Club intend giving a harbour
picnic when the weather gets warmer. This is a most
indefinite fixture.
Sydney Bicycle Club hold their sports at the Associa-
tion Ground on 30th hist. Sydney Bicycle Club Ball will
he held at Need’s rooms on 2nd Sent.
Sydney Suburban Bicycle ball at West’s rooms on 24th
ult. proved a very jolly affair. Of the dresses, Miss
Brnsclie wore a handsome gown of black moire with front
of red silk draped with black lace and clusters of red roses
on the left shoulder; the Misses Scholefleld (2) in cream
moire slashed with eau de nil silk ; Miss Larnach, white
silk relieved with buttercup velvet and maltese lace, tan
gloves, shoes, and diamonds ; Miss Grey, black lace over
maize satin. A weird garment was in bright pink satin,
and one girl had evidently come out in her dressing-gown.
Floor, supper, and music left nothing to be desired.
The vice-regal inspection of Fort-street Public-school
on 25th ult., was a very successful ordeal—the infants
presenting Lady Carington with an address for her
youngest daughter, at the reception of which Lady C.
was“ visibly affected,” and of which the Baron remarked
that when lie got back to his own old, grey home that
address would he bricked into the w all of the front hall
“ as perhaps the most cherished object in the house.”
After the cantata, march past, and the speeches, luncheon,
cooked by the girls in the school kitchen, was partaken of
by the vice-regal party, after which Lady Carington in-
spected the needlework, and the proceedings terminated.
Lady Carington, in a short and pretty speech, signified
her intention of bringing Miss Judith Carington to
“show' her thanks in her own childish way” to the
school-children.
At the inspection of the Sydney public-school cadets,
on Moore Park, Lady Carington will present colours to
the juvenile regiment. The vice-regal party will include
Gov. Hamilton, of Tasmania, with Lady Hamilton and
suite, who will arrive at Government House about
18th Aug.
N.S.W. Cyclists’ Race Union meeting eventuates on the
Association Ground on 2nd August. The prizes are especi-
ally handsome and competition should be keen.
Lord and Lady Carington will be the guests of Mr
James Dalton during their visit to Orange, on Bth October
for the purpose of opening the Waterworks in'that cold
and frosty district. They will stay two days—the first to
be devoted to the ceremony and a banquet; while on the
second, Lord and Lady Carington will be entertained at a
picnic among the lotty Canoblas—let us hope a westerly
won’t be blowing at the time.
To celebrate the laying of the foundation-stone of the
new Grenfell Hospital on 18th August, a ball will be held
in that gay little township on the evening of the same day.
On 22nd ult. Gov. and Lady Carington entertained a
bevy of people to dinner at Government House, the party
including Lady Hall 6, Chief Justice and Lady Darley, and
several officers from the warships now in Farm Cove.

I see from the papers that Madame Melba achieved a

One of the most remarkable escapes ever
made from Pentridgo took place, some years ago,
and even Pierre Douar’s artistic flight is left in the
shade by comparison. A gang of convicts were
engaged in erecting a massive wall round the grey,
old prison, when one ingenious person persuaded
his mates to build him into the wall. A few air-
holes were left in the mortar, and that night
87028, or whatever his official designation might
be, lay hidden in the solid masonry, while the in-
dignant warders were wearing themselves to
tatters rushing over the surrounding country in
pursuit of him. When darkness came on 87028
gave a tremendous heave which shifted the block
of stone above his hiding place, and emerged from
his concealment, and fled. The language dis-
charged after him next morning, when the scheme
was discovered, was too powerful for publication,
but he never came back.
A plain, rowdy-looking bushman lately

down to watch the administration of justice.
Australian justice, however, is an article that
seldom leaves a favourable impression on the
beholder and the visitor contained himself with
difficulty until a contempt of court case occurred
and the prisoner was fined in the sum of 21s. Then
the visitor went softly up and deposited the sum
of 425. with the clerk, stating that ho felt at least
twice as contemptuous as the man who had just
gone out, and that if he had had any more money
about him he would have let his feelings out and
indulged right off in £5 worth of derision for that
court and everybody connected with it. Owing to
financial pressure, however, he would subdue the
rest of his sentiments till he got his next cheque,
and then he would come down and let fly all the
disgust that was in him.
In China all outstanding debts become
null and void at the end of the year, and the
sheventy-per-shent Chow who can’t overtake his
debtor by five minutes to twelve on the last night
of the year may as well give up. Consequently
the few days before that fatal date are filled with
invoices, and letters of remonstrance, and duns,
and clamour, and every Mongol who has a cent
owing to him is plunging round in search of the
dishonest pagan who objects to pay. As a rule
he seldom finds him, for he is hidden away some-
where, and won’t emerge till he feels himself safe'.
But as pretty nearly everybody owes money to
somebody else, and none of them ever settle-up if
they can help it, China comes out about square.
Nobody has got his own money, but everybody
who is not a congenital idiot has got somebody
else’s money instead. The custom is one that wo
strongly recommend for adoption in Australia, as
being better fitted for exportation than any other
Chinese custom we ever heard of.

“Frou-Frou,” as played at the Sydney
Criterion, differs greatly, if memory be faithful,
from the version first presented to an Eng-
lish-speaking public with Mademoiselle Beatrice,
we imagine, in the name-part. Comparison
is not wholly to the advantage of Charles
Chairington’s adaptation, for the introductory
acts are “ talky,” and the concluding situations of
the two last acts, strong though they be, are
dragged out to a length that sorely tries not only
the actress on whose shoulders the burden of re-
presentation mainly falls, but also the capacity of
■a mixed audience for sustaining extreme tension
without lapsing into a revulsionary condition. The
performance of Janet Aohurch is not so satisfy-
ing as her Nora. In the lighter scenes
up to the close of the third act—here the jealous
denunciation of her sister and frantic-exit are per-
fect— natural and equal to every emergency, her
methods in the concluding acts suggest a replica of
some French original. Miss Achnrch has already
shown that she need not make use of models for
her inspiration : she has the application, intelli-
gence and emotional sensibility necessary for self-
imbuement with a foreign personality. Her
studies, therefore, should be from the life only, for
the performer who thinks and feels before simu-
lating has only to reconcile two personalities,
while the mere imitator has to blend the conflict-
ing natures of at least three, an assimila-
tion that always suggests artificiality even to
auditors who are unable to discover the
reason for their convictions. Miss Achnrch can,
and will, improve on her present performance;
but, even as it stands, no actress in Australia
could approach within measurable distance of it,
Sartorys, in the hands of Mr. Titlieradge,
scarcely has the weight and dignity that should
be imparted to it, but is otherwise faultless. In
the last act, when his pent-up love for the erring
wife sweeps away the barriers set up by pride, his
thrilling “ Gilberte” is a particularly fine touch.
Next in importance is the performance of Louise
by Fanny Enson—admirable throughout, one of the
very best things of the evening is the manner in
which she receives the proposal of Sartorys—whom
she loves—for the hand of Gilberte. Herbert
Flemming’s Valreas is flawless, and now that Chas.
Charrington has settled down in a wig that does
not wholly outrage possibility, his impersonation
of the giddy father betokens careful and intelligent
study. Minor characters are well interpreted by
Nita Steele, whose last appearance on these-
boards, perhaps in Sydney, was with Essie Jenyns:
by our very old friend J. P. West, and Alice May,
while “ Bob ” Watson, having escaped safely from
“Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” scores heavily in a “one
side ” part. Hedley Churchward’s Sartorys’
interior is a delicate and artistic piece of colouring,
and liis backcloth picture of a Venetian lagoon
affords further proof of his versatility. By the
way, “A Doll’s House” was taken off in the
height of its popularity ; it would pay, and please
the profession, who ate dying to see it, should
management revive it at a matinee or two.

“ Paul Jones ” is drawing big biz at Syd-
ney Royal. The feature of the show is the singing
of a carefully-trained chorus of fresh voices, one
of the best that ever came hitherward. Aggie
Kelton’s sabot song is the surest encore of the
performance; the little woman’s voice seems
thinner than of yore, but she is as kittenish as
ever. When Snazelle draws hia cutlass out of
Leitch’s tobacco-pouch now, he wipes off at least
a pint of gore (property-made) which runs down
towards the footlights with a realism that would
gratify the soul of a carcase-butcher.

Maggie Moore has caught on to some pur-
pose at Her Majesty's, where big houses prevail.
George Rignold has worked a couple of new
situations into “ Meg,” and that flop-footed speci-
men of dramatic workmanship does not limp so
confoundedly as on the first nights of production.
Maggie Moore has introduced another song or
two, but Harry Jewett’s refreshments are viewed
with growing incredulity by the gallery, whose
knowledge of ont-door refreshments entitle them
to speak with authority on the subject.

A Cyclorama advertisement says : “ Listen

know that the noise of “Heaven’s artillery” is
produced by the janitor sitting down suddenly
on an upturned weak-bottomed tin-tub, that the
flashes of “ lb even s lightning ’’are evoked by the
band’s lighting his pipe inside the rim of an
ophicle’de, and the rain effects by the opera-glass
boy dropping marbles into General Meade’s helmet.
Oh, no, we wouldn't give the thing away !

The Kev. Charles Clark concludes his
School of Arts season on Thursday evening with
the Thackeray lecture, which, on a prior occasion
(much to the astonishment of the Much-Travelled),
attracted one of the largest houses of the season.
The lecturer is apparently a hero-worshipper : he
never speaks in anything but the highest terms of
the great men who have so unconsciously been his
benefactors. The peccadilloes of Thackeray and
Dickens, like the Irish and Scotch atrocities of
Cromwell the Great, arc drowned in the Lethe of
forgetfulness, and the deeds that made them famous
are depicted in the most glowing and warranted-
never-to- wash-out colours. Perhaps the lecturer is
right • perhaps it is best to ignore evil when no good
can be done by stirring it up. Anyhow, the
“Thackeray ” decture is one of Mr. Clark’s best
efforts, and his description of the manner in which
the Ponto’s governess played “Sicha gittin’ up
Stairs ” would bring smiles to the face of a stone-
god Sydney School of Arts having proved much
too "small for Rev. Charles Clarke’s audiences, he
moves next week to the elegant Centenary Hall,
commencing on Thursday.
“ Formosa,” at Melbourne Royal, will do
Kttle to restore the ruddy glow of health to the
wan check of a tired management. A reprehen-
sible spirit of contrariness seems to hover around
the present revival, making most of the principals
do things they ought not to do, in the wrong way,
and filling listless liandfnlls of supers, with a fatal
sense of their limited numbers at the very moments
when they should ho descending upon the chief
situations with au irresistible swoop. There is no
artistic force in the production, so it happens that
Boucicault’s cynical contempt for sporting possi-
bilities stands revealed in all its preposterous
nakedness, and the incidents which never were,
and could never he, stick out from the show like
finger-posts pointing the thumb of scorn at their
own inanity. At this time of day it is barely
worth while to mention, once again, that “For-
mosa ” is a reckless outrage upon all rules of boat-
racing, and that the heroic Oxford stroke-oar who
trained for a University contest in the arms of
Delilah, and got down to his proper rowing weight
on a course of baccarat and lobster-salad, would
never enjoy the triumph of being number eight
in the winning crew that spurted home to Mort-
lake on the end of a string. The notion of the
gallant Oxonians going back in the betting for the
want of a leader to take them out for their daily
practice, and being driven to send the coxswain
to wait upon that lost sheep in the gilded haunts
of sin and implore him to return to headquarters
at Putney—such a notion requires acting of the
highest order to pull it through. As regards the
dual existence of Jenny Boker, who occasionally
tears herself away from the caresses of a dissolute
nobility to enjoy the virtuous calm of her parents’
rural pub. —there is less room for ridicule. Women
were deceivers ever, and even a “tawny-haired
syren of Hyde Park ” would make some occasional
sacrifices of lordly endearments for the pleasure of
making a fool of her chuckle-headed mother.
Moreover, Miss Formosa Boker does comparatively
respectable madiing down at the pub., by which
means she probably contrives to keep herself sup-
plied with a sort of modest blush, and a faint
semblance of a maidenly twitter.
# # *
The many acting opportunities which this
naughty old drama affords are pretty generally
misused at the Royal. Miss Edith Blande is no
more than a negative success as Formosa. Critics
who cannot distinguish between a fine part and a
fine performance, and who have never seen this
particular character more completely filled, may
bo satisfied with Miss Blande’s interpretation.
Yet it lacks tenderness in the one place and dash
in the other. Miss Maud Williamson has to
squander her graceful presence upon an insipid
secondary character, and pretty Miss Gwynne is
as nice as she will ever he until she learns
to hold herself straight, it makes one sad to
see so winning a creature always suffering
from nervous contortion. Hoyce is excellent in an
original rendering of the man who wants to sell a
little dawg. Clyndes is rather mechanical and
tamo in Irving’s old part, and Captain Do Burgh
altogether out as Major somebody, who should he
the brightest and most popular member of the
crowd. A really capable comedian, in Fred
Neebe, converts the pathetic figure of Dr. Doremus
into a solemn caricature of Ally Sloper, while the
Boker’s ph'c and mere are badly misrepresented by
George Walton and Mrs. Walter Hill. The latter
merely serves as a noisy reminder that the firm
should import at least a collide of clever “old
women” actresses as soon as possible. Others of
the company are passable, especially Athol wood
in a very difficult position, and the scene of For-
mosa’s villa at Fulham is a tine florid work of
Brunton’s art. A little improvement on the first
night’s performance will enable the drama to run
three weeks.
There was another crowded house at Mel-
bourne Bijou, on Saturday, and “Turned Up,”
admirably played and staged, will probably do as
good business as the “Pickpocket” did for one
week only. Next Saturday (Aug. 2) the B. and B.
talent will be let loose upon “The Balloon ” and
“Kerry,” a double bill which should render
another rapid change unnecessary. “ The Bal-
loon ” has not yet made its ascent in Melbourne,
while “Kerry ” never fails to strike home.

Two other theatres break out afresh upon
the same evening. Although good houses have
sighed over the costly love-story of Bellew and
Mrs. Potter, and the fame of the balcony scene
has spread afar, yet Sardou is about to he substi-
tuted for Shakespeare. They will return to “La
Toscjj, ” for six nights before trying “ Frou-Frou,”
which latter should last out the remainder of the
present season, until such time as the comic opera
company return from Adelaide. At the Opera
House, where business has got down to zero,
Saturday is to witness a revival of “ Held by the
Enemy,” with “a powerfully augmented east.”
And no Melbourne east is in such desperate need
of augmentation as that which has hitherto hung
like a mill-stone around William Rignold’s
massive neck.

Slade Murray and his rather ambitious
variety show are fetching them in overflowing
multitudes to the Gaiety Hall; the Victoria ap-
pears to be temporarily knocked out of time_; and
the Phonograph has come down to the inevitable
shilling for admission. After another week this
remarkable, but disappointing, machine will com-
mence to travel round the country, under the all-
important management of the MacMahons, whose
name has been so intimately associated with the
Phonograph in the columns of the daily press that
the world is gradually learning to accept those
immortal brethren as the inventors. Every time,
too, that the funnel breathes forth a tune, the
Macs, smile in such a superior manner and seem to
know such a lot about it that the genjus of Edison
sinks into insignificance, and his share in the
entertainment fades clean out of memory.

being absolutely devoid of real meaning for nine-

The news that Cedric Burnett, the original
of “Little Lord Fanntleroy,” is dying of con-
sumption, fills one with a sickly sense of sorrow,
quite unmingled with surprise. No actual exist-
ing boy, bearing a mental or physical resemblance
to the hero of Mrs. Burnett’s novel, could be ex-
pected to go on actually breathing for very long.
The strain of continually calling his mother
“Dearest,” and smiling sweet, childlike grins at
an aged peer of the realm, would naturally be too
much for a constitution enfeebled by never having
a fight with the boy next door, or throwing heavy
pieces of road-metal at the police. Then, again
MR. GEORGE LEITCH.
if the original Cedric is burdened with a bustle
only distantly approaching to those of bis stage
representatives, he must of necessity die young.
He isn’t built the right way to enable him to
effect escapes from his tough, unfeeling comrades,
when they arrange to dowse him in the water-butt
and comb out bis long, dank, golden tresses with a
garden-rake. No doubt the other bays have
amused themselves by wetting Cedric right through
until the ,cold settled on his lungs and laid the
seeds of that distressing complaint which is slowly
passing him hence. Perhaps he used to protest
that he would run home and tell “Dearest” how
unkind they were, and such conduct would inevi
tably hasten his end considerably. This world
was never intended for Little Lord Fanntleroy,
or else Providence would not have invented
hair-cutters ; and if any gentleman present
has a large blue-eyed son who persists in
calling his mamma “Dearest’ after he (the
blue-eyed innocent) has turned seven, the
said gentleman is earnestly recommended to join a
Benefit Burial Society, iu readiness for the sad
family bereavement that must shortly come about.
The writer had a kind of Fanntleroy boy in train-
ing for some few years, and used to watch the
kid’s glorious bead of hair glinting in the sunlight,
and the broad lace collar flapping round bis snow-
white neck. It was all right until the pride of
his fond parents began to pine and wither under the
influence of a spiritual asthma and the weight
of his lovely wool. Then a practical-minded
dearest lopped-off the clustering curls and turned
the damask-cheeked treasure loose among the
beasts of the field, and the bad, unwashed boys
who play marbles, until Fanntleroy left off
coughing and began to mutilate his garments
something dreadful, and otherwise lay the founda-
tion of a happy, commonplace, bald-headed old
age.

The Turners, who made their first appeal*
ance in Sydney with Madame Christianunder Re v-
R. S. Smythe’s management about eight years ago,
have retired from the Halle Company, and their
place is occupied by Miss Frances Saville.
The British drama is not to be allowed to
play a lone hand out here any longer; it is being
taken in hand with a view to improvement.
Since bis installation as manager at a certain
big theatre a well-known author-actor has care-
fully revised and considerably improved most of
the plays produced. It would be very interesting
to hear what the late Charles Reade, who could
call a spade a spade better than most men, would
have to say to this,

Mr. George Leitch, now recovered from a
serious illness induced by a stage-accident, attri-
butes his recovery greatly to the freedom from the
cares of management that followed bis joining the
Nellie Stewart Opera Company. It is some time
since Mr. Leitch appeared in Sydney, and he now
shows his versatility by raising Pierre—a mere
shred of a character, and altogether at variance
with his Prince Malleotti in “ Forget me-Not,”
Judge Thibbets in “The Pearl Diver,” Parson
Meekin in “ His Natural Life,” and Walter Chis-
holm in a. “ Touch of the Sun ’’-—into prominence.
As an author Mr. Leitch (George Ralph Walker)
has shown sufficient ability toensure the production
of “UncleZac.,” “Sithors toGrind,” “A Touch of
the Sun,” “The Improvisators,” “The Coming D,”
“Money Down,” “(Id Times,” “Those Girls”
on the British stage and in the colonies, “ The
Pearl Diver,” “Wanda” (written for the
Maierqnis), “ The Librarian ” (a free translation
of Yon Moser’s “ Der Bibliotheka,” also the
source of “The Private Secretary”), and an
adaptation of “ His Natural Life,” which book he
was the first dramatist to approach. Mr. Leitch
has also collaborated with Mr. Walter Besant in
“The Reigning Beauty,” a play founded on one
of that popular novelist’s works, and now in
Beerbohm Tree’s hands, who will, in all proba-
bility, ere long stage it at the Haymai’ket.

A writer iu the World observes that “ no
actor-manager ever gave full play to his powers
through his doing only the tilings he liked best to
do, always following the line of least resistance, and
living his whole artistic life, so to speak, with the
limelight on his face.” This may bo read as a
solemn warning to Handsome George, who prefers
to play maudlin heroes, instead of artistic villains,
merely for the joy of wearing a wearisome halo at
the end of every act. George Darrell, for like
reason, has for years been making love instead of
representing semi-comic friends of the family,
parts in which he would be always seen to advan-
vantage. Dampier, again, is not entirely free
from a similar weakness. Fortunately there are
no limelight considerations to influence Brough
and Boucicault in their choice of characters, while
as for Williamson and Garner, they seem to follow
the line of least resistance by not acting at all.

“Pendragon” writes in the London
Referee :—-
A friend, who usually knows his way about, asked me
the other day: “How is it that theatrical managers
(I note in their puff advertisements 1 Opinions of the Press’
from all sorts of rum and queer and shy papers, and
papers which no one ever se.es and never hears of, except
under these circumstances, while it is a rare thing to see
the' Referee quoted ?” This was not a very easy question
to answer, as most folk who happen to be well up in the
ways of mummers and employers of mummers will under-
stand. Fortunately, as T have said, my friend usually
knows his way about, and it didn’t take long for him to
learn that only stuff is quoted that is not critical—or that ,
being critical,'i»of a kind which fits in with a manager’s
view of what atone should constitute criticism. “Ah,”
slid lie, “it's easy enough to see it now; but 1 never
thought of it like that before , and knowing how your
paper is run after by play-actors as well as playgoers,
I've often wondered how it is you’re not, as a rule, starred
in the advertisement columns of the daily papers. Dear
me 1 And yet it’s as plain as the nose on Henry Petit fa
face if only you come to think about it.” Perhaps my
friend would have been still more emphatic if he’d known
all I know about the way in which some managers as good
as demand favourable notices; and how when they do
quote from a real good paper they take a line from here
and a sentence from there, and make by this means what
is really an awful slate appear quite complimentary. The
publio.is always being treated as if it were the most con-
summate of asses; and it really must be such if it can
swallow some of the “opinions* of the Press” that have
been put forth of late by certain “ eminent ” theatrical
lessees and proprietors.
The above paragraph applies quite as well to The
Bulletin in Australia as to the rad’eal Referee
in London.
#* * *
J. L. Toole is given to informing the
snobocracy of Australia, in strictest confidence, of
his intention to speak to his friend the Prince of
Wales about The Bulletin. It seems that the
first time this rather over-fed and over-rated
Johnny read the periodical in question he was
overwhelmed by its awful “ disloyalty.” Nothing
so inimical to the interests of perpetual monarchy
and the House of Lords had met his eyeglass in
the whole course of his life. He shuddered so
hard that the glass dropped from his line of vision
into the soup, and floundered helplessly among
the bits of maccaroni while Toole sat gasping out —
“Isay, yerknow, it won’t do at all, yerknow, it
will have to be stopped, I say,” and much more
eloquence of a similar nature. The Bulletin
was, in fact* a ghastly revelation to Hingland’s
greatest comedian, striking terror to his simple,
little soul. Why was such a thing permitted, he
desired to know, and when somebody mentioned,
with an apologetic cough, that it was an unavoid-
able calamity established for the purpose of seeing
that a lot of other things were not permitted,
Toole crumbled up into a heap of ruins and groaned
aloud. Week after week since then he has held
small, select meetings on each successive number
of The Bulletin, invariably inquiring of his
honourable friends whether they have seen that,
and what ought to be done in the matter. After
laying out his own sixpence on another dreadful
number he will go around buttonholing creation to
inquire why they take it. One man, being pro-
bably lost to all sense of shame, said he took it as
a tonic every Sunday morning in bed,, whereupon
poor old Johnny, who is not wanting in pluck,
fired up indignantly and asked that man if he
thought Her Majesty would read such a scandalous
publication regularly, sir. The man aforesaid ad-
mitted that His Gracious Queen would not do
anything of the kind, because the first dose would
probably up her constitution on the spot,
and Toole left him without another word. Poor
Johnny, bless his dreary wheezes ! is honest
enough in his dislike for the paper which strives to
pull down his stupid old idols. Wehave’read some-
where that Toole, sen., was toastmaster to the Lord
Mayor, or something equally elevating, so his
father’s son would naturally be trained up to pray
for the landed aristocracy. The rabid animosity
of a sassiety joker like Toole is no small compli-
ment to a respectable radical journal, and as he
tours around Australasia, finding The Bulletin
ever with him, we trust he will splutter his pro-
tests until all is blue. We have no fault to find
with him as a man, or as an actor in those good
old parts which consist so largely of baggy
breeches. In fact, the worst we know of Toole is
that he is considered funny by the Prince of
Wales, who will shortly be speaking to his royal
mother and Lord Salisbury about The Bulletin,
you understand.

The wildly-gifted M‘Milkn, of thoN.S.W.
Cabinet, fired off a noble sentiment the other day,
He stated that he believed in “ working in that
.particular sphere where the real channels of the
people’s feedings lay, and where were to be found
at play those elements which ultimately found
their outlet in the political manifestations of the
people;” and if this lofty conception were only
turned upside-down, and tiie front end of it put in
the middle, and the verb moved up a little closer
to the audience,- and placed in a position where it
could be more easily seen with the naked eye, and
then the whole thing were read off b a kwai ds by a
one-eyed man standing on his head, it .would fill a
yawning void in the gigantic soul of the nation.
If Mae. had lost his subject down a deep drain at
midnight, and it had then been left lying in the
street for three weeks to be rim over by tram cars,
after which he had found the remains of it
in the gutter, and wiped them on the
tails of his frock-coat, it could hardly have
been clearer, even to the commonest under-
standing. The only possible objection that could be
raised is that the remark, when printed, is hardly
large enough to wrap a pound of butter in, and is
too heavy to be used as a kellick when our uncle
goes out fishing; but regarded as a weapon of
offence to lie sent in a dray to your enemy it fills
the bill. Mo long as the people's feelings continue
to “lay ’ in a ‘ channel ” and that channel is in
the sphere that Mr. M'Millan speak's about, and
provided Mr. M'Millan keeps in the same sphere
anil yet doesn t fall head-first into the channel,
and at the same time the “elements” already men-
tioned continue to find the outlet hereinbefore
alluded to, so as to avoid wear and tear of the
channel; and supposing the sphere doesn't get
damaged, and the feelings which are lying in the
channel don’t come out and go somewhere els -,
there doesn’t seem to be much danger.

The latest report concerning Ned Trickett.
once the god of Australia’s idolatry, is that he lias
applied for a 40-acre lease, and is going out to look
for silver. It is hardly worth while being a cham-
pion sculler at all if the end is to be such a woeful
fall as this. To clump wearily over a sodden hill-
side in search of that fleeting delusion known as
“ indications.” To dodge on all-fours into old,
disused tunnels, and crawl up heaps of ancient
t’eiris and fall violently down on the other side,
and land half-stunned in
a squashy spot, while his
mate crawls after him,
and fqlls on t p of him,
and lands his extinguished
candle in Ned’s mouth
and ear, and then to blas-
pheme at each other in
the dark, and try to
spit out the candle, and
accuse each otherof being
the cause of the disaster.
Then to get up again and
-wade along that tunnel
till they find a lode which
made everybody insol-
vent who tried to work
it, and induced one pro-
prietor to go mad, and
murder his wife, and inter
her at midnight'on a quiet
corner of the property.
J ust here, most probably,
tliere will be that un-
happy object called a
“ rise,” and Ned will give
his mate a leg-up that he
may examine it, and the
mate will ask Ned to take
care what he is shovin’
at, and by-and-bye, when
the discussion is at its
height the man who is
ascending will lose his-
hold and comedown with
a whiz and a whoop and a
scream on the summit of
ins partner’s head. Most
likely at this point in
the proceedings, they will
disagree about the geolo-
gical formation of the
disliict, and sit down
for three-quarters of an
hour in a cold puddle to
argue the matter, Ned
being of opinion that
the formation is con-
nected with something
whose name sounds like two madmen trying
to outcurse each other, and his colleague
being convinced that it owes its existence to
a geological circumstance which resembles the
yell that a lost soul might give if it sat
down on a hot coal. It is even possible that
they will call each other bad names just about
here, and each will state that the other is an
ignorant encumbrance ; but very possibly their
• attention will be called off by noticing a
package which somebody has left in the tunnel,
and they will inspect it and find it contains
i nough dynamite to blow them and the ruins
of the claim away into the upper air. It
stands to reason that they will then leave the
tunnel hurriedly and bruise themselves a good
deal in getting out; and if they afterwards resolve
to sink a shaft the ordinary cussedness of tilings
makes it nearly certain that it will fill with water
when they have got down 100 feet. Also it is
(liree chances to one that Ned's partner will
disappear at the same time, and Ned won't
know whether he is dead and anchored down at
(lie bottom of the mine, or whether he has
kipped, and it is almost a dead sure thing that
Ned's pickaxe and his coat, hat, and boots will be
away down in the bowels of the drowned-out
property. If Ned starts to fish for the lost goods
iie wou’t got a solitary bite in 48 hours, and
it is safe to prophesy that it will rain all the
lime, accompanied by TTa.il and thunder;
and at the end of that time it will be
discovered that the lease is null and void
owing to an informality, and someone will
give Mr. Trickctt notice to quit. Whether
he will assault this person and aim mud
at his eye is a point for his own exclusive con-
sideration, but anyhow the final act Of the drama
will be tliat Ned, if he has luck, will make ids
way back to his quiet hotel at Rockhampton, with
a bad cold and a rheumatic attack in both feet,
complicated wdth severe inflammation of the car.
We have always viewed the ex-champion with a
friendly eye, and for that reason we implore him
to abandon this mining business right off, We
have tried it and escaped alive, but Ned is a per-
son of abnormal dimensions, and the hundred-
weight of rock which just skimmed over our head
the day the blast went off unexpectedly would
have taken off the top part of him bodily. If he
wants excitement and change of scene the retail
prawn industry is open to him, and the fried liah
trade presents attractions which lie , has possibly
overlooked, but unless’ lie desires to .blow 'off ail
bis limbs and return as a mere stump 1 in a wheel-
barrow he will quit mihirig riowand for ever.

A young man with a complaint and a
shattered hat exploded into a police-office at
Brisbane one night last week, and grasped the
officer in charge by the front button, and fixed
him with his baleful eye, as. he explained how
someone .had just floored him by a blow from
behind and cleared him out. He was a desperately
excited young man, and he threw his hmbW all
•over the-place as if they were serpents, and gam-
bolled round in a lightsome, angular way, and shot
back and forwards across the room, as lie besought
(he force to rush out like the electric fluid and
capture his assailant. But the officer was calm
and collected, and in a patient, official way he
urged him to sit down. Then he brought forth a
huge crumpled volume and prepared to write.
“ Yer na-ame? ”he inquired slowly, and the com-
plainant stated that he Was called .Jones, “ Com-
pla-aiut lodged by a per-r-son av the na-ame
av Jones, ’ murmured the officer as he wrote
laboriously. “ \ er-r aige an’ okkypa-ashun now.
als-HO yer-r addr-r-ress? Spake slow, will
yvz ? ” It took about a quarter of an hour
to get these facts down, and Jones
threw out his legs and arms galvanically as
he thought of his assailant flying further and
further into the dim distance all this time. When
he had finished the official proceeded to inspect
his visitor more closely. “ >Say ver-re bruise on the
back av the head, tie mused thoughtfully, and
solemnly entered the circumstance. “R-regar-rdiiT
the per-rson that mo-lested ye, now. Can ye fur-
rnish his na-ame?” The injured citizen ex-
plained indignantly that he bad been struck
from behind in the dark, and had never even seen
the attacking party. “ It’s a-always advisable to
have the na-ame av the per-rson that mo-lested
yez,” said the interrogator reproachfully. “Ye
see, the infar-rma-ashun’s inoomple-ete without it.
Ihd ye for rm any estimate av his pr-robable
aige.'’ “ No, I didn't.” “We-ell, supposin' we
put down his aige as twinty-sivveu, then. Have
yc any r-reason to sup-pose he was mor-re than
t winty-sivven? “.No- well, we ll put that down.”
“And L sup-pose,’’ he went on in a persuasive
tone, “ he didn’t lave indyca-ashuns behind him
that might give ye an idea av his okkypa-ashun,
now ?” “Of course he didn't. How could I tell
what his occupation was?” screamed the com-
plainant, holding his injured eye in his hand. “Av

you think there’s any chance of finding him?”
“ We-ell, I’ll tell ye what we’ll do. We’ll put

then the bruised Jones stumbled out into the

post with one hand and clutched his injured head
with the other, at the stupendous grasp which the
Eoree always manifests at a great emergency.

Ifc is hardly worth while being a lawyer in
New Zealand now. The distinction between
barristers and solicitors has been abolished for one
tiling, and it is no longer necessary for the rising
perverterof truth and justice to be articled—he
can spend Ins days in splitting mils and digging
fence posts if lie likes, and study law at night, and
go up for examination in his hob-nailed boots, and
even if he leaves a lump of mud the size of a spar-
row on the mat as he enters the examination-room
it doesn’t matter much. And now it is proposed
to do away with the .‘ general knowledge ” quali-
fication, on the ground that a man can establish an
alibi for a hog-stealer quite as well without Latin
and Greek, or any other old resurrected language,
a; with it; and that nobody cares a straw whether
he knows or does not know the names of a line of
dead kings who got drunk beneath a gilded
dome; and that as his ditty is simply to get
up and state in his native language that his client
was plugged in the eye, it doesn't matter even if
lie can’t tell how many notes a sackbut has, or
whether shawms have strings or not. And on top
of this indignity Sir George Grey has introduced
a measure providing that doctors shall give up
spending their early years in going through
deceased languages and coming out in an exhausted
and ignorant state at the other side, and should
devote the time thus saved to learning not to stir
up a patient’s inside with a fence-rail, or to heave
sixteen different medicines at him in one bottle on
tin; off-chance that one of them will hit his com-
plaint and the results of the other fifteen be found
out at the inquest; and as a preliminary step
towards this reform it is demanded that all pre-
scriptions shall be written in English in order
that the patient may not be called upon to swallow
carbolic acid and essence of pounded snake with-
out knowing it. It seems hardly worth while to
be alive when all the dignity is taken out of things
this way.

It is rumoured that Italy proposes to resume
her Abyssinian campaign, and wipe out the combus-
tible King of Eastern Africa —or burst. There is
no sadder job on earth than an Italian campaign in
Abyssinia. The local potentate calls out all his
troops and takes gentle walking exercise about the
country, and the other fellows'pound along after
him, but always find that he is just ten miles
ahead. They can’t waste the country with fire
and sword, for the country consists chiefly of
1 nicks and dust, and it wouldn’t burn even if
kerosened and then struck by lightning. They
can’t kill anybody, for there is never anybody in
sight, except now and then when a shirtless native
can be dimly descried through a telescope. Some-
times they take up a strong position somewhere,
but no man can spend his whole existence
loafing in a strong position, and the king
simply waits till they get tired of it, knowing
by experience that a position of any kind
soon gets monotonous when nobody takes any
interest in it. Occasionally they send in an ulti-
matum, but the king merely drops it on the floor
and leaves it there. He used to put things like,
these on the file, but when the file got choke-full
of ultimatums he gave it up. Now and then a
mud hamlet is captured, but there is never any-
thing in it but old bones and infection, and even
when a proclamation is issued annexing the whole
country it makes no difference, for that intern in-
able potentate is still ten miles ahead. The only
variety in the whole proceeding is when the local
monarch proves to be ten miles behind, for a
change, and busy annexing the invaders baggage,
anil then they rush back to look for him, and he
isn t there, Generally the Italians get so mad at
this stage that they annex another thousand miles
of territory and start for home, and King John
starts after them with a sudden activity that
makes them leave all their guns behind them and
bolt, after sending in another ultimatum.

A case of riotous and festive bigamy is
under consideration in England. The offender
married his first wife in 1577, and left her two
years afterwards. He doesn't know whether she
is alive or dead, and nobody else knows either.
At all events he married again in 1880, the sufferer
( his time being a vision of ethereal loveliness with
an American divorce from her first partner, which
document is said to be no good. If the other wife
was alive on this occasion, it is obvious that a
mean fraud was perpetrated on a trusting woman,
but, on the other hand, if the American divorce
was merely a piece of waste paper, the second
marriage didn’t amount to anything, and it is a
matter of little importance whether the original
lady was alive or not. Things begin to grow mixed
at this point, and they become worse later on, for
after a while the American person began to gush
with coals and broken dishes and boots instead
of with soft endearments, and her husband
fled in fear of his life, and married somebody else.
Whether he committed bigamy this time or not
seems doubtful, for the status of the third wife is
past finding out. If the first female on the list is
really deceased, and the American divorce doesn’t
count, then she is all right; but the earth has been
turned upside down and shaken in a vain search
for that early female and nobody can find her
either alive or dead, and the beauteous American
is prepared to club anyone who says her divorce
won’t hold water. Conjecture drops down dead
at this stage of the enquiry, and though from
sheer force of habit the prisoner married last year
for the fourth time nobody seems to take much
interest in the fact. The fourth wife doesn't
come in anywhere. The great difficulty, how-
ever, is how to draw up the indictment, for it
is no earthly use to accuse the piisoner of
marrying the third wife while the first was alive if
they can’t decide whether she was alive or not, or
while the second was alu\, seeing that no one
knows whether the second lady ever had any
standing at all; and though a good and solid case
might be made out of the last marriage, seeing
that the third person in the category was certainly
in existence when that event came off, yet, as the
latest wife has fled to avoid giving evidence, this
part of the scheme necessarily falls through. Pro-
bably the handiest solution of the difficulty would
be to shut the defendant in a room with all his
mothers-in-law. You always find a l l a man’s
mother-in-law.
If a Chinaman dies while being tried for
murder it is considered a sufficient evidence of his
guilt, and his son is sent to prison, or beheaded
the case is a particularly heinous one. When the
descendant is too young he is adopted by some
Government official, and carefully reared until he
is old enough for execution. As it is a matter of
considerable importance that he shouldn’t die
before the execution cones off, every care is taken
in his rearing and education, and he goes out for
a run every day in charge of a policeman or other
public functionary, so that he may perish in good
order and condition. If there is no son then the
criminal’s father or uncle or brother gets a flog-
ging. The offence is somewhere in the family, and
somebody has got to pay for it. Even the offender’s
cook is liable to be bambooed off and on for a
month or so, if there is nobody else in the house-
hold to stand the racket.

The Sydney Echo editor says his paper is
distinguished for “ wit and humour without
cynicism and scurrility.” In other words, the Echo
goes in for what Judge Darley once commended as
“wholesome fun”—the Judge’s favourite organ
whereof is now dead as Mr. Marley.
The obscene parody on Purves’s second
Christian (!) name, which nearly turned Melbourne
City Court into a prize-ring last Thursday, was
uttered by David Gaunson as a whispered “ aside,”
but a second of perfect quiet just then rendered
the remark distinctly audible all over the Court.
The Barrier Miner (N.S.W.) publishes a
brief description of its enemy ; —“ His missing-
link and low-grade forehead receded from two
heavy gaol-door-mat brows, and his hieh cheek-
bones rose in sallow haggardness round a nose
that stood out like Yorke’s Peninsula on the map
of Australia.”
Miss Weidermann sues the Honorable
Walpole in England for breach of promise, involv-

Miss Weidermann has none at all, but bungles
her case and loses it. All are equal before the
law. Why cannot a Walpole face a Weidermann
before a fair judge ?
The question of a new Pope is on the
tapis. The understood principle, for long past,
has been that the Pope must be an Italian, to
obviate the jealousies of France, Germany,
Austria, Spain, and other nations, but the rule

man as Cardinal Gibbons in America.
J. G. Knight, the new Government Resi"

Poo-bah, and is regarded as an improved Czar up
that way. He has five different billets, and gets
about £6OO a year after twenty years’ service. He
is by profession an architect, and it was he who
designed Melbourne Parliament Houses.
Frank Lincoln, it appears, invested much
of his Australian-made “sugar” in “Centrals,”
just before the shares made a retrograde move-
ment. This was the only part of Lincoln’s busi-
ness which L. J. Lohr didn’t manage for him, the
latter being of opinion that operations in silver
are best confined to scooping it in at the doors.
The mother of Greville, the Court Chro-

mother standing behind him, and so he went on
till Greville said he was just off to dine with her.
The Mining Standard appropriately gives
a notice of one of Australia’s really clever men,
Robert Wallen, of Melbourne, mining and bank-
ing expert, and journalist. His “Under the
Verandah” in one paper, and “ Talk on ’Change ’
in another, were most admirable. It was his
business journalism which established the pros-
perous and able Banking and Insurance Record.
When authors collaborate, one of them
nearly always writes all the MSS. Such is the
result of I’ecent in vestigation of the work of Scribe,
Labiche, Erckmann-Chatrian, Besant and Rice,
Sims and Pettitt, &c. This may be accounted for
by the supposition that one author is responsible
for the situations, the incidents, the naked frame-
work in short, while the other finds the language
with which these dry bones are clothed.
A purgative medicine should possess tonic and

John Haynes speaks of Mr Collins,

Wrong, John, this time. A gentleman can’t be

as he can be persuaded into becoming an Orange-

Cohen, Mayor of Adelaide, went into Par

elect its own Governor, and do many other great

and Adelaide people want to know when that re-
solution is to be tabled again.
The Victorian Premier has abandoned one
of his proposed railway lines on discovering that
it was planned to start from a howling wilderness

might choose to land in the deserted vicinity and
commence an invasion by rail.
It is of no use endeavouring to bolster up
by argument the landlord’s present legal!y-acknow-
ledged preferential claim to rent. The only class
which has the cast-iron front to support this claim
are the lawyers and those who live on precedent.
The landlord’s preference is just as unholy as was
the jus primee nocti's, and it must go the same way
as that and all the other feudal iniquities.
A number of Melbourne land-agents and
such have met to protest against the Bill for
abolishing the seignorial rights of the landlord in
the matter of distraint for rent. The alleged ob-

any such Bill will discourage building and decrease
the employment of labour. It won’t, however.
The Bill will merely encourage land-agents to
collect rents regularly.

There has been of late, in Sydney, a little

The Bulletin would as soon see the Devil ap-
pointed as Governor as any local resident who was
the choice of Downing-street. Such an appointee
would certainly be one of the old gang. The fact
of the matter is, of course, that the agitation has
been started in the supposed interests of Sir

The Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, when
being conveyed by train from Portsmouth to
coerce the mutinous Guards in London, sang
“God Save Ireland.” and gave cheers for the
Guards. They were immediately replaced by a
Yorkshire regiment. A somewhat similar state of
things to that prevailing in France just prior to
the Revolution now exist in England. It may be
remembered that the National Guard, on various
occasions, sang the “Marseillaise” when they
should have shouted “ Vive le Roi!” and then,
when expected to repress disaffection, took their
places in the ranks of the disaffected. The
crumbling British throne will yet require to be

Mr. Jeffreys, of the British House of
Commons, is a bounceable man with a hidden woe.
He went for the Postmaster-General recently on
the ground that members were unjustifiably re-
quired to pay postage on their correspondence,
and had even to buy their stamps personally, and
lick them, and stick them on. Consequently, he
wanted to revive the old privilege Of franking
letters, and when he was told that this couldn’t be
arranged, he wanted to know if some attendant
couldn’t moisten the stamps for them and perform
the menial job of fixing them to the envelope in
order to prevent the gum getting into the mem-
bers’ systems. But the heartless Government only
grinned a base, imbecile grin of derision and said
that gum was beneficial, and that the hon. member
should be glad to have nourishment thrown in
with his stamps.

Society
The new Governor-elect of N.S.W., the
Earl of Jersey (who in England and Wales owns
13,1)37 acres, with a rental of £55,773), is described
as “an advanced Conservative, a genuine sports-
man, and a fluent speaker a Tory, a turf-man,
and a talker. The Bulletin has been reading the
English papers for a good many years, and blushes
to have confess that, though it believes it has
seen the Earl’s name in the racing-list (just as it
lias seen that of the Jubilee Juggins), it has failed
to store up any of the pearls of wisdom which have
fallen from his Lordship’s mouth up to date.
However, it is never too late to mend, and we are
all prepared to value the genius of his Lordship
according to certified samples thereof. However,
we hope the daily papers will not make the mis-
take of asking us to bow down to the Earl on
account of his distinguished lineage. We are not
all such benighted barbarians as to be unversed
m the doings of his sacred Majesty, George IV.
* * *
The English Governors resident in Aus-
tralia unite, as would only be natural, in sounding
the praises of the Earl of Jersey, just as the
Earl of Jersey, when he gets back to London,
will trumpet forth at the clubs the earnest
piety displayed in Sydney by Baron Car-
ington as Great Mogul of the Young Women’s
Christian Association. Of the direction in which
Lady Jersey will exercise her influence, it need
only be said that she is one of the most prominent
and loquacious orators of the Primrose League,
the apparently defunct Sydney branch of which
institution will (just you watch it!) have had a
violent revival shortly before her Ladyship reaches
the colony. Lord and Lady Jersey have five
children.
Lady Cariugton was “at home” at
Government House, Sydney, on 31st ult., and we
had fully intended to be there, but unhappily
various unforeseen circumstances intervened. The
venerable family carriage had gone to have the
hind wheel greased for one thing, and one of the
250-guinea horses had got a cold, while the other
one was employed fetching in coal. Also, the
£5OO animal with the golden shoes, which is
generally kept in reserve? had been lent to a duke,
who failed to bring it back. The family diamonds
had gone out to be newly soled and heeled, and we
were engaged in getting a new handle fixed to our
crest, and the hereditary coat-of-arms required a
patch on the hinder part of it. These opera-
tions, unfortunately, were not finished in time.
And, _ in addition to all these troubles, we had
mislaid the ancestral pedigree, and the Master of
the Horse was in a state of beastly intoxication,
and raving down in the cellar, and cursing at the
Seneschal and the Mayor of the Palace, and the
rest of the retainers ; and as if these troubles were
not sufficient, we discovered at the last moment
that somebody had left the plate and other heir-
looms out in the rain, and they had got rusted. It
was this last calamity that decided us to stay at
home and fill in the afternoon in overhauling the
title-deeds ; and consequently there was a vacancy
and a blank and a g'oom in the vice-regal halls.

A “Boys’ Purity Society”—otherwise a
Juvenile Gimlet Association—has been started in
Sydney, under the auspices of the Y.M.C.A.,
whose ruttish eyes can see the most hideous
iniquity in tights. The movement will give
us a whole host of detestable little self-righteous
hypocrites, prigs and sneaks. The Pure Boy
must never, at risk of breaking his oath, use a
swear-word, and will, when he attains perfection,
be like the sanctified engineer on the New Jersey
Central Railroad who never cussed in his life, no
matter what happened. In an accident his loco-
motive was smashed all to pieces. The engineer
walked around the wreck, gazed at it mournfully,
paused, and ejaculated: “Oh, fiddle!”

Mr. Wimble, of Queensland, finds divorce
an expensive game. His wife, having got a decree

his estate is good for the money.

Mr. Bertrand, dentist and murderer, used
to drug his lady patients before submitting them
to nameless indignities. Mr. Bertrand set down
his exploits in his diary, and as in it the names of
several Sydney ladies of high social position were
compromised, he will never get out of gaol, as does
the ordinary reprieved murderer who serves his
twenty years or so—as a matter of fact he has now
been in prison for nearly a quarter of a century.
He is the victim not so much of the Law as of" a
personal revenge to which effect cannot be given
in ordinary cases.

Now there are extensively - circulated
rumours of an assault said to have been committed

A Melbourne journalist was sent to “do ”
& Mothers’ Meeting in Collingwood, a gathering of
the rich and quasi-scientific tabbies, to preach at
the poor and ignorant. It happened that a kid-
gloved predecessor had been soaping down the
tabs with “ A great work being done ” and similar
tommy-rot, but the new man wrote that it was all
humbug—half a dozen common women lectured
by a dozen stiff-’uns. He said they went the
wrong way to work and ought to come down to
the common women’s level, really associate with
them, and so on. The honorary lady secretary
replied tartly in a letter to the paper: “Your
reporter is quite wrong. For the time being we
do associate with these people.” The journalist
returned to the charge with “ Look here, that’s
just what the common people resent, your asso-
ciation ‘ for the time being. ’ ”
# * #
Melbourne residents are surprised to see
such a venerable business as Henty and Co. ’s to
let. It brings to mind how Mortimer Franklyn’s
papers mopped up £90,000, the accumulation of
the old-time Henty toil. One plants and another
gathers, with newspaper plants. Everybody is
sorry for the Hentys, who were real aristocrats
from a human point of view—for they were an
honourable and generous family—men, women,
and children. As a rule, there is little sympathy
among the masses for fallen wealth, but all Aus-
tralia is genuinely sorry for the misfortunes of
Victoria’s old historic family.

The ladies who come into town laden with
fiddle-cases are not going to a music-master’s —-
any more than the swells who do the Block carry-

are going to play lawn-tennis. Those ladies are
shopping. On returning, the fiddle-case may con-
tain remnants, ribbons, feathers, &c., or it may
contain tea, sugar, candles and bacon—each item
bought at some grocery that makes a specialty of
the cheap sale of one particular commodity. We
have watched them at it.

mash of the same name. The Bulletin can see
no just cause or impediment why a rich, common-

named De Vere, if they both feel so disposed, but
as an item of Australasian interest, the contem-

The proprietors of a totalisator, at Adelaide,
sent a contribution of £B, being part of the profits
of their uncircumcised implement, to the trustees
of the Female Refuge, the other day; but the
pious b ard struck an attitude like Ajax defying
the lightning when he felt sure it was going to hit
somebody else, and handed the coin back. They
also mentioned something about the wages of sin
being death, and made a side allusion to an animal
mentioned in Scripture which is understood to be
unclean and not a fit specimen to be allowed to
sleep under the bed. The totalisator people now
point out indignantly that the board didn’t sub-
scribe £8 of tueir own money to make up the loss
which their outraged feelings caused to the unfor-
tunate inmates of the Refuge, and hint that it is a
very inexpensive thing to sacrifice. £8 which was
meant for the poor, and to strike imposing atti-
tudes when some one else has to pay for them.
They propose, therefore, that the board should
defray the cost of its own lofty indignation in
future, but that body declines to hold any further
communication with the children of sin, and the
subject has dropped.

Through one of those vicissitudes inci-
dental to “colonial experience ” a certain reporter
was once employed in cutting burrs on the Mur-
rumbidgee. One morning news arrived at the
burr-camp that a volunteer was wanted at the
home station to replace the bullock-driver, who
had left without notice. The boss told the re-
porter to try the job as “you’re no dashed good
here.” The team set out on a week's journey, and
all went well for the first day. The express-man
spent the night comfortably in a hammock slung
bullocky fashion beneath the dray-pole, and next
morning succeeded in yoking-up the brutes—the
most trying part of the profession. About mid-
day the bullocks, crossing some soft ground, got
“ stuck,” and refused to move. The reporter tried
the usual remedy, hard swearing, but in vain.
Hi s vocabulary of oaths having utterly failed, he
loudly addressed the team in such Parisian
phrases as “ Have you seen the dog of my uncle?”
“Give me the knife of your father.” No good.
Then a brilliant idea struck him. He imagined
himself Editor Winter in Melbourne Herald
composing-room with the “setting” ten minutes
behind. Ere the day was over the team had made
a good record.

wishing people to give her money.” The magis-
trate, Montagu Williams, suggested that quite a
host of people were always wishing the same thing,
and promptly discharged the poor creature without
the option of three months’ imprisonment. Then
it dawned upon Constable X. that he himself
usually looked as if ho wished people to give him
money.

An Italian opera troupe once left Milan
for Australia, and couldn’t afford to take the bari-

The fact that the Australian Cities Invest-
ment Corporation, formed in London with a capi-
tal of half-a-million sterling, are first going to
operate on the “ Kensington ” estate, near Sydney
reminds us that the old “Scotchman” claim, at
Charters Towers, was the first Australian mine
sold by Pritchard Morgan in London. “ But
Scotchman ’ won’t do,” said the astute Pritchard
-—“let’s call it ‘ the Disraeli.’ The English hate
the Scotch—havq hated ’em ever since and before
the time of Doctor Johnson.” And Disraeli it
was.

Lord Duulo, the titled idiot who has been
egged on by his relatives and “ friends ”to divorce
the music-hall singer whom he married and then
left at the church-door at the instigation of the
relatives and friends aforesaid, seems, at time of
writing, quite unlikely to succeed in legally
getting rid of the lady, who Wanted to accompany
him to Australia, but was prevented from doing so
by the nobility, and was left to support herself
in her own way during the indefinite absence of
her distinguished husband, who now says he
“tossed up for her” with two other men'of his
own kidney. In point of brains she is far too
good for such a hopeless numskull, and so far as
what is known as “morality” is concerned, she
can't be much worse than Dunlo’s father, the Earl
of Clancarty, who admits, with a calm im-
pudence born of hereditary privilege, that ho
gave Lewis and Lewis, the “smarty” London
solicitors, “carte blanche to get rid of” the
1 ileasant-looking, little music-hall dancer. If
Dunlo is a fair sample of the Clancarty family,
then it is quite certain that it will not be safe to
let any of them off the chain at full-moon until
the head of the house shall have eloped with an
athletic music-hall dancer or a healthy cook,
and produced an intelligent heir to the title.

A pair who were divorced in America
seventeen years ago met and re-married in Sydney
not long since. And, by the way, a couple whose
quarrels ended in a divorce, the details of which
will long be remembered in Sydney Hebraic
circles, have re-married and are now living har-
moniously together.

In the interest of the common people,
Melbourne Hospital must be pulled down. In
the interest of the common people Sydney Hos-
pital must be built up. The strong opposition in
certain influential quarters to the building of a
large and permanent hospital in Macquarie-street
is mainly due to the fact that it is considered un
desirable to locate hospital patients on so valuable
and central a site in so fashionable a residential
quarter, while cheaper accessible land can so easily
be found. But no site can be too good for a hos-
pital, and that decided on is one of the most
glorious in the world. It surpasses in the beauty
of its outlook any with which we are acquainted.

Capital punishment evidently is about to
be abolished in the United States, remarks a Lon-
don paper, and the abolition is coming about in a
somewhat strange way. No doubt there is a
growing public feeling against it. But in the
State of New York this feeling is supported by
the electric companies. Why? Because, the law
having already substituted electricity for the
hangman’s rope, the electric companies are afraid
that the association of “ current ” with death will
tell against their business.

Speaking of the alleged mysterious disap-
pearance of David Christie Murray, says George
Augustus Sala : “The hospitable colonials would
never have allowed the favourite novelist to leave
their shores without giving him a festive ‘send-
off.’ He would have been entertained prior to
his departure, as on his arrival, by the genial Club
at Melbourne, or by the pleasant Athenaeum Club
at Sydney.” “The genial Club.” That is how
C. A. S. disposes of the Yoriek, the Melbourne
literary club for whose members he has professed
so profound a contempt.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]

vhioh the sun never sets—tho wealthiest nation in the

•iml-si'xpence a day, and (smiling benignly) here is an

you’re in the land of bondage yet,
Though sophists call you “free
Lo ! when thy masters pass ye by
In thought you bend the knee.
Your children bred as patient thralls
By cruel laws kept down —
Thy daughters sweep the rich man’s halls,
Or stitch his lady’s gown.
Ye drudge and moil thy whole life through
To keep the wolf at bay,
And ’fore thy offspring’s bones are set
They sweat for paltry pay.
The Rich, they go in garments fine,
In Pleasure’s path to roam,
And with the gold your sinews earn
They build each marble home.
They’ve leisure and they’ve luxury,
' And plenty for their share,
And silken robes resplendent bright
Bedeck their ladies fair.
While yours—they drudge in sordid homes,
Although ye are the strong;
And so you’re tamely shorn like sheep—
How long, O Lord, how long ?

Migraine.
Nervous headaches and neuralgia are the first,
surest, and most reliable symptoms of approaching
decline of physical health. They are distinctly
nerve pains, an infallible telegraph message prog-
nosticative of approaching physical weakness.
They are intimations that the strength is being
impaired. Overwork of any description must
result in enervation and enfeeblement of the
corporeal structure. This wear and tear (termed
by scientists destructive metabolism) may be
brought about by worry, excessive mental or
physical labor, by continual attention to business,
by bad food, bad air or any acute sickness, the
duties of maternity, the strain of motherhood,
dissipation, and many other causes. The proper
remedy is Clements Tonic. This must and will
cure the worst and most severe cases. This is a
positive fact; it has done it, and will do it again
always. We are thus emphatic because we know
we are talking facts, which the evidence of dis-
interested persons proves. Mr. Henry A. Crane,
a gentleman well known all over the colony writes :
Dear Sir, —For the last seven years I have been a
victim to the most excruciating agony from
neuralgia, and also suffered from extreme nervous-
ness. I tried hundreds of so-called specifics,
but without avail; and, being a commercial
traveller, am particularly liable to colds frtm
exposure to draughts, &o. ; a slight one even
always fled to my facial nerves, and caused
neuralgic pains, preventing sleep and causing
excessive sympathetic headache. I saw Clements
Tonic advertised, procured a bottle, and in two
days the pain was completely cured, a c nsumma-
tion I had never expected, and am deeply thankful
for same. This was four months ago, and from
then till now I have never had the slightest twinge
of the-excruciating torture I used to have. May
make whatever use of this you like. W. H. East,
Esq., Stanthorpe, Dulwich Hill, N.S.W., suffered
a martyrdom of headaches, due to disordered liver
and indigestion, frequently having to leave his
work in the middle of the day. He took a
course of Clements Tonic, and writes: Stan-
thorpe, Dulwich-street, Petersham.—Dear Sir,
—For years I have been a great sufferer
from headache, which has at times so pro-
strated me that I have been totally unable
to attend to my work. I have consulted the
most skilled physicians in Sydney, and spent con-
siderable money in fees and medicine. I, how-
ever, obtained only temporary relief, as they
treated the effect, and not the cause. I was re-
commended Clements Tonic, and determined to
test its efficacy, and I am very grateful for the
good results which have followed its use. I took
five bottles, and am wonderfully improved, and
have had no return of those excruciating head-
aches since taking that valuable remedy. Results
like this must encourage your laudable efforts
to alleviate the sufferings of your fellow-
men ; and you have my sanction to publish
this. Sydney Cunningham, Esq., 70, Watkin-
street, Newtown (N.S.W.), writes as follows :
Dear Sir, —Having been a long sufferer from
neuralgia, which weakened me considerably, after
using various remedies without benefit, I was
induced to give Clements Tonic a trial, find am
pleased to inform you that the result exceeded my
utmost expectations, and after taking five large
bottles I feel better than ever I did in my life
before. My wife and other members of our family
have used it with equal success, and I can strongly
recommend it to others suffering in a like manner,
and offer you this unsolicited testimonial to use as
you think fit. Reader, can any other medicine
show such a record of cures as Clements Tonic ?
We think not.

The Melbourne Freetrade Democrats are
a queer lot, and one told a meeting the other night
that £1 would go further in (Protectionist!) New

fore New Zealanders were ever so much happier

Charles Gavan Duffy, aged seventy-some-
thing, is about to wed a lady of seven-and-twenty.
That will make four. It reminds us of the old
Sydney magnate who has had six or seven spouses
and who, whenever he has just married a new one,
takes her to his wife-plantation and says : “ Look,
Mary Jane lies here —and that is where poor
Agnes is buried ” —and so on.
A Melbourne paper reminds ns that De
Freitas, the Christian Portuguese, owner of the
big Mechanics’ Restaurant, Bourke-street, still
holds his “eight o’clock rush.” For many years
this philanthropist has laid about 70 free covers
nightly, and of such is the Kingdom of Heaven —
Freitas and the dossing Lazaruses. Freitas is a
Royalist, and hangs up portraits of the Emperor
of Brazil.
Louise Michel began life as a governess in
the family of the Count de Soissons, and her first
exploit was to smash the crucifixes belonging, to
her pupils, the Count’s daughters, and to dance
round the Count’s dining-table denouncing the
parish priest, who was sitting at meat with the
family. Louise has for years devoted all the
money earned by lectures and press-work to the
support of her aged mother and to charitable and
revolutionary purposes.
Wallace, septuagenarian baronet, is dead
in England. He was a millionaire, an illegitimate
son of George IY.’s gay old buck, Lord Hertford,
whose wife figured in the list with Lady Conyng-
ha n and the CoUntess of Jersey, Mrs. Fitzherbert,
and.Perdita Robinson. George IY. was up to the
list furnished by Lepdrello to Don Giovanni.
However, Wallace was a good sort who came in for
tho Hertford cash and disbursed it generously.
But the Hertford line is extinct.
Sir Robert Peel remarked that the less

A governor of New Caledonia assumed
his authority while the natives were still can-
nibals. There had been rumours of an insurrec-
tion. and the admiral called before him a native
chief, who was faithful to the French cause, and
questioned him as to their truth. “You may be
sure,” said the native, “that there will be no war
at present, because the yams are yet far from being
ripe.” “ The yams, you say ?” “Yes. Our people
never make war except when the yams are ripe. ”
“Why is that?” “Because baked yams go so
very well with the captives,”
Amelie Rives,, the hysterical authoress of
the “Quick and the Dead,’’ has a rival, Nellie
Littell, who has wrested from her the bun of
notoriety lay appearing in Central Park (N. Y.)
astride of a horse. She is described as a “ well-
built, ruddy-cheeked damsel, with a touch of red
in her nut-brown hair, and a laughing, but deter-
mined, glance in her large grey eyes. She rode a
spirited mustang, and was dressed in a broad-
brimmed hat with a black ostrich-feather, a cut-
away jacket, and a bifurcated cloth skirt, beneath
which were knickerbockers of a similar material,
and high boots.”
| ‘When Anthony Trollope edited St. Paul’s
Magazine— both editor and magazine are now out
of publication—he interviewed a well-known lady
novelist, in order to obtain a novel from her pen
which would run through the magazine as a serial.
The lady refused to allow any of her works to be
thus mutilated. “ But,” said Trollope. “it is
necessary for the purposes of a magazine, and
Thackeray and Dickens have done it.” This
roused the lady’s ire. “Would you compare my
writings,” said she, “with the things of Thackeray
and Dickens?” “Can’t,” said Trollope, in his
gruffest manner; “never read a word of your
writings.”
Philippa Fawcett, who beat the senior
wrangler at Cambridge, is a daughter of the late
Professor Henry Fawcett, Gladstone’s blind Post-
master-General, and his wife Milicent, sister of
Mrs. Garrett Anderson, the well-known lady-
doctor, who visited Australia a few years ago, and
is the wife of the managing director of the Orient
Steam Navigation Co. Singularly enough, one of
the senior wranglers defeated by Miss Fawcett is
also blind. The lady usually wears gowns of her
own manufacture. Newnham College turned out
another Cambridge lady wrangler some years ago,
Miss Blanche Hewett, now head-mistress of a
girls’ school.
In “ The Life and Correspondence of the
late Dr. Doyle ” (R.C. Bishop) occurs the follow-
ing story Examining the students at Carlow
College, the Doctor said to one of the students
named Garrett: “Supposing you were saying
Mass, and let a spider fall into the chalice, would
you feel yourself authorised in picking it out G
Garrett was silent, but, having been prompted by
another student, he replied : “ I would swallow it,
my Lord.” “ Very good,” said Dr. Doyle ; “ and
if a donkey fell into the chalice, what course would
yon adopt?” “Swallow it,” responded Garrett,
mechanically. “Hoofs and all?” inquired the
Bishop. “Yes, ’replied Garrett, to the infinite
amusement of the assemblage.
A French book, just translated into
English, has gained an enormous circulation, all
over Europe. It is the- Autobiography of Marie
Bashkirtseff, an eminent Russian painter, who
died six years ago, aged only 24. The diary was
kept from the age of 12 up to her death, record-
ing minutely a 1 her feelings, on the basis of
Rousseau’s Confessions. She.and Bastien Lepage,
the immortal landscape-painter, were in love with
each other, and. both dying. Their couches were
in one room, and it was a race which should die
first, the winner only gaining by a few weeks. Of
the book its translator, Mathilde Blind, says :
“ To read it is an education in psychology.”
Lydia Becker, an old-time champion of
Woman’s Rights, died the other Saturday.
Twenty years ago Lydia was a laughing-stock to
the ponderous “ representative ” persons, and
mechanical pressmen, who mocked at lady doctors,
lady students, and lady thinkers of all grades and
conditions. Lydia was in truth a somewhat mas-
culine virgin, as were most of the early sisters of
the “movement,” but so far from being the eccen-
tric individual supposed in the dark ages of 18G0-70
she never advocated any Light which is not freely
recognised by intelligent men to-day. Lydia died
happy, no doubt, in the knowledge that her life-
work was, to all real intents and purposes, accom-
plished.
The most successful of the ex-parsons in
the Victorian Legislature has been Davies, the
Minister of Mines—nothing in blood to the gilded
and titled Speaker, or in money either. He
swarmed into Parliament about 20 years ago, with
a terrific batch of ex clergymen, so that there was
an outcry about the pulpit being made a stepping-
stone to politics, under the wing of loyal liberalism,
M'Cullochi m and Higinbothamy; but Davies
never was a proper parson, his education having
been scientific, which makes him a fit Mining
Minister. The scroll of parliamentary preachers
has been endless : Cooper, Bell, Richardson,
James, and.so on. To-day the pulpit’s played out.
David Blair was the first conspicuous parson in
the Southern Parliament.
Tough yarn from London paper ;
The recent death of David Buchanan, apr ominent poli-
tician of N.S.W., lias brought to light a characteristic
anecdote of Carlyle. Many years ago Sir Henry Barkes,
the present Premier of that colony, came to England as
an emigration lecturer, and made the acquaintance of
several distinguished men. Amongst others upon whom
he called was the grim Sage of Chelsea, with whom he
had a lengthened conversation, and he went away laying
the flattering unction to his soul that he had made a
distinctly favour'’hie impression upon Carlyle. Some,
time afterwards Mr. Buchanan left Sydney for (ondon to
study law in the Middle Temple, and he was commis-
sioned by Sir Henry Parkes to deliver a fine opossum rug
as a present to Carlyle from his antipodean friend and
admirer. Buchanan, soon after his arrival in London,
went down to Chelsea, was ushered into the Sage’s pre-
sence, and said ho had been charged by Sir Henry Parkes
to deliver “ this handsome present.” Then there was an
awkward pause ; the Sage sat silently thinking, and at
last he growled out, “I remember him-a babbling
gorilla.”
Truly the ways of Providence are past
finding out. A few weeks ago the ship Oneida
went to wreck on the wild coast of Alaska, and
the captain and 45 white men,went down into the
great deep. And yet 33 entirely unnecessary

stolen dog in the embezzled frying-pan, and to
boil the harmless kitten and made her into soup

De Baucliee, against his wife, (now performing as
Tottie Silksox at the Bermondsey Britannia) in

Office is co-respondent in chief, came on for hear-

with all the fashion, beauty and intellect of the
British beau mende,
Collins v. Murphy, Melbourne Court,
ownership of magpie. Collins family lost Maggie;
found one like it in Murphy phnmilee; identity
denied. Test point: Collins’ magpie used to say
“ Milk, oil,” when the milkman came, but all the
tickling under its stomach wouldn’t make it say
“Milk, oh,” in court. Just as the Murphys were
carrying it off in triumph it yelled “Milk, oh.”
Verdict reversed.
A whole host of Bulletin paragraphs and
two long Bulletin articles, after travelling round
the world, have during the last week, found their
way back to Sydney and appeared in the columns
of the local dailies. This city’s papers only appre-
ciate Bulletin matter after it has received the
hall-mark of British approval. In England and
America, The Bulletin is immeasurably the best-
quoted Australian paper. By the way, “Scotty
the Wrinkler’s” chaining little tale “ Only For
Company,” which appeared in this journal a few
months ago, is quoted in several influential British
and American papers as a model st ry—which
quite coincides with- our own idea that, though
an unpretentious trifle, no cleaner-cut or more
artistic piece of literary work has been done in
Australia for t ■wen ty years.
The fury of lovely woman’s wrath has
descended, by an unbeaten track, upon John
McDonald, a gentleman engaged in digging last-
resting-places at Melbourne General Cemetery.
The other morning John was following his avoca-
tion six feet below the surface of the old-
established bone-yard in question, when the calm
serenity of his daily toil was disturbed by a
shower of bricks, and before he had time to enquire
within as to whether it was Resurrection Day
and the adjacent corpses were stopping to give
him one for his nob on their way to Judgment,
the awful truth of the matter glared down upon
John from the brink. Mrs. Walsh had arrived,
and was slinging the large, oblong pieces of baked
clay with her own fair hands. John, away down
at the bottom of the excavation, knew well enough
that this indomitable female had tracked him
to his lair at last. He didn’t ask for
an explanation of her conduct, because his
conscience told him that she was obtaining repara-
tion of his sins in luring old man Walsh to the
pub. and keeping that enviable husband and father
away from his happy home. In any case, more-
over, John couldn’t open his mouth to expostulate
with the bricks which were fast laying him low for
ever. Every time he emerged from the debris and
attempted to escape from his place of immurement
the bruised social misdemeanant found himself
shoved back upon a coffin-foundation by Mrs.
Walsh’s umbrella, and the work of burying John
beneath the ruins progressed steadily. At last an
emissary from Providence, in the shape of a
brother grave-digger, was attracted to the spot-by
John’s awful groans sand u iched between the sicken-
ing thuds o, the - avenging missiles, and finally
this reinforcement succeeded in beating back the
enemy with a pick-axe, while he rescued Mr.
M‘Donald from his dreadful position in the bowels
of the earth. At this stage, too, the police
arrived, and carried away Mrs. Walsh to liquidate
her liabilities with 205., or, in default, seven days
imprisonment. She’s all right, so to speak, but
John M‘Donald now makes his daily descents
into the cold ground with the heavy heart of a
man who knows not at what moment the blow may
f all and the brick be visited upon him. Between
each prod of the spade he glances upwards, ex-
pecting to see Walsh’s missis in the act of cutting
him down like a flower.

The present British hangman’s autobio-

In the Moi’daunt case the Prince of Wales
was not examined “on oath” at all, nor was it
before the House of Lords. He was called as a
witness in the divorce-court, Lord Penzance pre-
siding. The court declined to have him sworn,
stating that they were prepared to accept “his
word of honour.”
A Bill relating to the law of evidence,
now before the Victorian Legislature, provides
that no barrister shall “ insult or annoy a witness.”
Considering that that is about the only thing that
a barrister is good for this seems a most instilling
proposal. The very first duty of the “ learned
counsel ” is to rush dojvn on the testifier in the
box like the wolf coming down on the fold, and
reriiind him that “You are on your oath, sir,” tell
him that he ought to be in the dock, and ask him
if he “ would be surprised to hear ” something that
never took place.
Rev. Shirley Baker must find it hard to
maintain a meek and humble deportment at the
present time. Only a short while ago he was
Pope ot Tonga. He was 'also Premier, and prac-
tically King. Now he is none of these, and every-
body is tilling up the newspapers with articles
showing how lucky it is for Tonga, the Tongese,
King George, the Wesleyan Church, and the
entire South Sea Islands that High Commissioner
Thurston has tired him out. However, the Lord
tempered! the wind to the shorn lalnb. A few
years ago Saint Baker had a good say in the
B.N.Z. But perhaps, you know, it was “only as
a trustee.”

DOING THEIR WORK WELL.
Writing from Gundy, Mr. William Grace says :
“I received the watch safe sent to be repaired,
and it is now going as well as ever. I have had it
owo years, and it always kept first-class time, tdl
I overwound it. I have carried a watch for forty
years, and never found one to give me the satisfac-
tion of the Waterbury, although 1 have paid
twenty guineas for one.”
Mr. Arthur Taplin, Cobbity, writes: *’l’m
peifectly satisfied with the Waterbury watch I
have in my possession. I see a good many of the
I watches, and it is the general opinion that they are
j good, cheap watches.”
From Cowra, “F.A.” writes: “My watch
I came safely to hand. It has given me great satis-
| faction since I bought it about two years ago.
Although it has had very rough usage, it has
! proved a good timekeeper, and I feel .confident,
that now, after cleaning, it will be as good a 8
ever. ”

The Referee.
Bookmaker Alf. Joseph must be posing in Eng-
land as a kind of leading Australian institution, whereby
British opinion of these beastly kawlinies is likely to lie
Jiuch chastened and improved, The Bulletin imaji'nes.
a reporter from the London Si-ortsman waited upon
Alfred the other day, and asked that swollen, suetty-
lookin 0- person if he didn’t hold, “many public positions”
(independent of his glittering social position) in his own
country. To which Alfred replied with a puffy affirma-
tive and was good enough to furnish a few details of his
o-reatness. “At present lam president of the Sandhurst
Racing Club, vice-president of the cricket club (one
“over” with the ball or two pulls at a pair of sculls would
cause Alfred to die in great agony), and I hold
ggwral other public positions,” says the distinguished
visitor from Australia. Evidently there was something in
aI-L’s lofty mariner of reply which suggested Cabinet,
secrets and the Federation Conference, because the
reporter visibly trembled and explained—" I wilt not ask
you anything political, neither will I question you about
the wonderful resources of your country’’—just as
though the fat hero understood any resources except
laying the odds. The reporter restricted himself to
racing questions, all of which the “leviathan”, answered
in a spirit of simple truth, claiming vast, superiority for
Australian management, and admitting the sit; e.iority ox
British jockeyship and training. Itis baldly necessary to
republish here the opinion of Alf. Joseph on matters
concerning which some thousand or two new-chum '
possessing a thorough knowledge of racing in
E no-land could speak with more authority. Th.it the
arrangements at Flemington, Randwick and Caulfield put
Newmarket, Ascot, &c., to the blush is as certain as that '
the finish of a big English race is a work of art fa t
beyond the comprehension of our Australian jocks
Australian bushmen arc masters in horsemanship,
pure and simple, just as Texas “cowboys” are,
but for men who thoroughly understand how to
nurse a thoroughbred in a race across the fiat we'must
still go to the country where such racing has been longest
established. The Americans discovered, years ago, that
thbir own riders were not good enough to put up in
England, where some of the best jockeys are primed w ith
the° accumulated lore of a line of ancestors, all of whom
wore silk in their respective days. It is not surprising
that such hereditary artists “ amazed,” actually amazed, a
man of Alfred’s rank and station by their skill and
cunning.
* * *
Judging from Sydney Metropolitan entries, the
A.J.C. Will have to make some drastic alteration in the
conditions of the race if they have any idea of keeping
pace with their great Southern rival. Take Sir William,
Marvel, Antseus, The Queen and Prince Consort from the
list, and on performances there is not a first-class animal
left. This is easily accounted for. The Metropolitan of
£lOOO is run before the Melbourne Cup of £lO,OOO, and as
the winner of the former incurs a penalty of 1411)., itis
not likely an owner, who considers lie has a show for the
Cup, wilt run the risk of having a stone put upon his
horse’s back for the big event. Again, the weights fox
the Melbourne Cup were published some time since, whilst
the imposts for the minor race are still unborn. To make
the Sydney Metropolitan worthy the wealthy club under
whose auspices it is run, there are two courses open to the
Australian Jockey Club. Make the. race worth winning
in these days of big stakes, or run it off after the Mel-
bourne Cup. This question cannot be longer shirked.
* # *
Melbourne Standard has hired a poet to fur-
nish horse information inverse. This person was. called
upon in the course of business to advise upon the Grand
National Steeplechase, so he shut himself up with a pint
of ink and an inspiration, and the spirit moved him. Pos-
sibly he was rather heavy to lift, however, for the spirit
didn’t move him far, arid it seems to have dropped him
again pretty soon. Here is a sample :
On the first day of the meet the tipsters were out,
And the question is asked, “ What were they about?”
They knew the uncertainty there was with Bravo
With old Ellerslie in they should have said, “ Why—iust
so 1” . . .
So the poet speaks out and will let you all in
To the secret of luck, and you all ought to win ;
Of the foremost flight, when the straight is reached,
The names of “Lawler,” “Sir Joshua,” and “Titoka
warn ” ’ll be screeched.
The remainder of the poem is too painful for reproduc-
tion. The inspiration gave out at this point, and the
metre broke down, and the rhyme died a natural death ;
and the poet was left stranded high up on a top note
amid a chaos of exploded grammar and decomposed pro-
nunciation. But he held on manfully til! the last, and
crowded in every horse he wanted to mention, and if the
horse was too big to go in comfortably, lie was shoved in
by main force. He said what he wanted to say whether
the verse was large enough to hold'it or not. Tho first
business of a poet is to unfold a plain, unvarnished tale,
and the Staniurd’.s bard evidently realises this. When
the tale won’t unfold, its owner had better coil it up and
sit down upon it , and keep quiet.
* * #
It is repeatedly stated that Mr. James White’s
horses in England have, by the,death of the nominator,
become invalidated for their engagements. The Bulletin
is under the impression that the stupid old Jockey Club
rule— by which the Australian horses would lose much of
their value, by-the-way—was rescinded a while ago.
# # *
Tom Hales, who is getting together a breeding
stud, has boughtLochic! from bookmaker Barney Allen. The
New Zealand jumpers Donald and Titokowarn, have like-
wise found new owmers in Messrs. “Boh” Phillips and
J. O. Inglis respectively, the- latter planking down 676
guineas for the G.N. Steeplechase second.

At tho Haggin sale in America Sir Modred’s
24 youngsters averaged nearly £4OO each. Fifteen by
Darohin averaged £306. The highest-priced animal at

fetched £ll6O. The next best w'as by Darehin—Tulare
£lO2O.

In yonr racing experience, you never met a man
so habitually cut to (he soul by losing as the Hon. James
White. Years ago he was warned that this absurd
sensitiveness would shorten his life, but nothing cotxld get
over his idea that his mathematical combinations ought
to come out with all the exactitude of astronomy. As for
w inning, that was a matter of course, wherefore his jubila-
tion never made up for his sorrow,

The now N.S.W. Governor, the Earl of Jersey,

Billy Murphy duly returned to Sydney per
Alameda, and his inarch dow n the gangway fairly fetched
the unwashed waiting for him on Woolloomooloo wharf.
William was attired in a very “ pee-wee ” hat and a long
ulster, carried in his smashing right hand three presenta-
tion walking-sticks, arid was followed by a faithful hench-
man, who humped a box containing the 660-guinea cham-
pion bolt, now on view in King-street. Murphy will
shortly meet “Griffo” at the Sydney Young Men’s
Chris— ~we mean Amateur Gymnastic Club, for a purse
“to a finish,” but the, writer does not think Murphy will
part with his mortgage on the belt on that occasion.
Murphy is said to have cleared £2OOO in the States. At
Honolulu the King gave him a walking-stick and a purse
of sovereigns.

The death of Mcßride, an aspirant to pugilistic
rewards whose organs were diseased, having occurred at
San Francisco at a time when slogging enthusiasm was on
the wane and officialdom was agitated by one of its
periodical spasms of energetic morality, lias been made an
excuse to put down prize-fighting in that city with the
strong arm of the policeman. That is the reason why
Murphy lias returned to Sydney, why Peter Jackson's
return is expected, and for McCarthy’s flight to England.
Now, what is to become of Fitzsimmons, Mnlholland, and
other Australians who are out in the Californian cold?
The poor devils will actually have to go to work.
*' * *
The crack English light-weight, Nunc Wallace,
has been defeated by one Dixon, a ’coon from Boston.
| The latter will likely encounter the winner of the Griffo-
Murphy contest.

As matters have turned out, Griffo acted very
wisely in shirking the voyage to ’Frisco.

The English cricket-going public must, dote on
Barrett, who was at the -wicket for a solid hour, in the
first international match, without scoring a run. A few
more batsmen like Barrett and the national game would
scon die from unnatural causes, unless saved by a rule
limiting each innings to a certain number of hours. By
the way, it appears that Scolton, formerly noted for his
precious “patience,” is coming out as a comparative
slogger this season.

Everyman has a natural style of “ shaping,”
and if the first time he “puts up his hands,” the right hand
and foot come to tire front, that is the style in which
Nature has intended him to “put a heart ”• -on.his. oppo-
nent. Should he take lessons from a professor ”of , the
“ noble art,” the professor will at once insist upon his
changing his style, simply because the right hand in front
will upset ail the stereotyped hit- stop-joVeand-get-away
business, and the teacher is at a loss how to instruct his
pupil. The right-hand-in-front man lias all the best of
the bargain, as he is probably the first man who has stood
that way in front of his opponent, who cannot make head
or tail of a man who does not stand in the orthodox
manner, whilst the right-hander is quite at home, having
been accustomed to box thos ■ who keep the left in front.
The two best amateurs the writer has seen in Sydney were
both right in front, Mr. George Seale and Mr. “Jack”
•Tones, the latter, by the way, an uncle to Mr. “ Sammy ”
•Tones, the cricketer. When George Seale first went to
Larry Foley to take lessons the latter tried hard to in-
duce him to change hands, but without success. Had he
been successful the writer really believes the phenomenal
amateur would never have been heard of.

A Melbourne paper points out that three-fourths
of the Australian cross-country horsemen are of Irish
extraction. The Bulletin pointed that out long ago. It
is also true in regard to the pugs.

The Commons’ adjournment for the Derby was
only secured by 160 votes to 133.

A private letter from England infers that one
or two members of the Australian Eleven are making a
fortune for the brewers. A glance at the batting averages
will bear out this statement. There must be something
that causes players, who had an Australian average of

Says a San Francisco paper :
The Fitzsimmons-M’Carthy affair was a surprise. The
former, with his long, lanky legs, showed up with a
powerful bust, and lengthy, strong arms. He is not only
clever, but a hard hitter with both hands. McCarthy,
who stood Dempsey off so welt, was never in the battle
with Fitzsimmons, who can safely be ranked to-day as the
champion, middle-weight of the world. La Blanche,
Dempsey or young Mitchell have no business fooling with
Fitzsimmons.

Dealing with the “Esquire” snobbery, a
Star correspondent asserts that “a recent arrival
from England, who now occupies a high position
in the N.S.W. railways not 1000 miles from the
metropolis, returns communications to tradesmen
and employes with the request that any future
communications should be properly addressed by
putting‘Esq.’after his name.” There is a well-
known Sydney cheap grocer who used to be ass
enough to act similarly to merchants’ clerks. No
invoice addressed to Mr. J. Tallbwdip was good
enough for him. »

'As nearly all the world knows, Stanley is
blessed with a head of white hair. His own
reason for the premature paleness of his tonsorial
thatch is the suffering and hardship he endured in
the great forest, but a different version has reached
our ears. In the last expedition on .one occasion
Stanley asked his officers to travel as lightly as
they possibly could, which request was complied
with, Major Bartlett even leaving behind his camp
bedstead, an almost absolute necessity when sleep-
ing out in the forests. On arrival at the station
this officer, on going over the baggage, found
amongst that of <he great pioneer a case, not of
brandy, but of Mrs. Allen’s hair restorer and
dye. Enraged at finding that he had sacrificed
his comfort for Stanley’s vanity, Major B. ordered
the bottles to be left behind, and the African
Pathfinder’s cranium gradually lost its erewhile
chestnut bloom, and. slowly assumed its normal
greyness. Hen e his present venerable and patri-
archal appearance.—Ex.

HUM OUR OF A CRANK.
HOW A PREACHER TALKED IN RHYME AND HOW
TO CURE HIS WANDERING FANCY.
In tho west of the United .States a clergyman
was seized with a rhyming mania. Every request
he made was in impromptu rhyme, and lie began
to deliver his sermons in high-flown doggerel. His
name, was supposed to be Snyder. Except for this
ho was perfectly sane. His friends advised him to
lay his case before the celebrated Dr. Hammond,
of New York, which lie did, journeying thither.
His first words were, on entering the doctor’s
office, as follows
“Good morning, Dr. Hammond, I hope that you
are well;
I’ve come a long distance my story to tell.
They say I'm insane, but that’s inanity ;
I've a rhyming inspiration, but that’s not in-
sanity.”
Whether Dr. Hammond cured his patient or not
is not stated, but the case is susceptible of easy
treatment, as it is only a mild lunacy. It would
cure itself if the subject was fortunately or unfor-
tunately stricken with pain of long continuance.
Pain would serve as a counter irritant, and it
knocks the poetry out of anything. Suddenly
attacked with the pangs of rheumatism, the
twitching aches of neuralgia, the acute tortures of
sciatica and lumbago, or the dull misery of sprain o ,
hurts, or bruises, which acting as a diversion to
such a perverted brain, the patient would talk no
more rhyme. As the folly wore off it would Ire
easy enough to cure the pain in any form, promptly
and permanently, in the manner followed by those
who know what is the best for it. Mr. W. Booth,
Thomas-street, Balmain, states : “ Had severe
rheumatism and no end of pain. After one or
two applications of St. Jacobs oil pain entirely
left me. Recommended it to my friends. My
wife was cured of neuralgia in the same way.”
“A member of my family,” says Mr. J. R.
Drewett, Glen View, Darlinghurst, “ was cured
by. St. Jacobs oil of the excruciating tortures
of rheumatic gout.” Mr. James O’Brien, stock
broker, Sandhurst (Victoria) says ; “ With less
than half a bottle of St. Jacobs oil I was cured of
acute rheumatism.” Mr. Arthur Pretty, 5 Col-
lins-street, Melbourne, states “that a bottle of
St. Jacobs oil cured him of chronic rheumatism.
He had no faith in it, but was intensely surprised
and gratified.” Mr. E. A. Little,,2ol Pitt-street,
Sydney, says he “is glad to testify that his wife
was cured of a painful rheumatic affection by St.
Jacobs oil.” Air. R. C. Payne, Brisbane) say’s :
“Ihave received instantaneous relief from acute
rheumatism of long standing by the use of St.
Jacobs oil.” Mr. Allister Brown, Auckland,
N.Z., writes: “Half a bottle of St. Jacobs oil
cured me of rheumatism so severe. I could liot lift
my arm.”, In like manner Air. D. Pass (of Feld-
hej-ni, Gotthelf, and Co,), Sydney; Mr. John D.
Flower, Balmain; Win. Lovering (S. Hoffnung
and Co.), Sydney; T. W. Allen (A. H. Nathan
and Co.), Auckland ; Mr. E. Benjamin (Hart and
Benjamin, Solicitors), Collins-street, Melbourne;
Thomas Robinson, Carlton, Melbourne ; Mrs. J.
Love, 145 Johnston-street, Collingwood, were all
promptly cured of rheumatism by the same means.
Such things to the well, mentally, were not diver-
sions, but how readily they were vanquished.

Medical Reform.
THERE exists a crying need for the medi-
cal profession to stay the quackery
which is so rampant in these colonies. Men
having no medical qualifications nor aptitude
for the treatment of diseases, still advertise
with impunity as “doctors”; and guarantee
to do what they know they are incapable of
doing, and thus deceive the public who are
caught by their specious and lying advertise-
ments, as is amply testified by reading the ex-
posures in the
DAILY TELEGRAPH
from August 3 to 11, 1887.
A chief cause of this state of things is that
medical men from mistaken notions of profes-
sional decorum, and because they consider it
“infra dig,” refrain from entering the field
against these quacks. So long as this prudery
exists so long will this canker consume our
youth. At the risk, however, of professional
opprobrium I have decided to throw aside this
false delicacy, and avow my sympathy with,
and readiness to treat such affections, in the
hope of saving the young of both sexes from
the ruin of health and mind which consulting
these quacks ensures, not to mention the ruin
of their pockets.
“ A patient writes to me : “ I am in such a
miserable state I would pay you what I could
afford for a lifetime, if you could possibly be
the means of letting me know what health is,
and perhaps saving me from suicide which
seems to be my only release if this appeal
fails. Kindly and humanely do not allow it to
be in vain, and you will never regret it. I
have been victimised by a person calling
HIMSELF A ‘ DOCTOR.
Now, if qualified medical men would adver-
tise in such a way as to bring their names be-
fore these sufferers, and convince them of their
sympathy, cases like the above, which unfortu-
nately are of daily occurrence, would not
occur ; groundless fears would not be excited,
and where disease exists it would be safely
and permanently cured.

Bny Wolfe’s Schnapps by the bottle.
At Poverty Point.
Apropos of the “Formosa” revival, a Melbourne
weekly (whose critic is apt to get hopelessly lost m
reminiscences) mentions that John Bilhngton was the
original Sam Boker. The present writer, hav * n S *
fairly intelligent infant at the tune, is prepared to swear
that John Bouse played the part in question. Mrs. BU-
lington—a rough and ready lady who could run histuomo
rings round her husband, as John B. would doubtless be
the first to admit -represented Sam Boker s wife, as it
happened. The cast of “ Formosa was especially good
all through. Irving was the Compton Kerr, whose an-
nouncement of his name was met by Mrs. Bilhngton s
enquiry—" How do you spell it? —an idea which has
been cribbed by a dozen dramatists since Boucicault first
struck it. He couldn’t have got that from the I rench.
The bibulous Brittain Wright was the loafer with an
eternal “ little dawg ” to sell, and clever David. Fisher had
a part in “ the Majah ” which suited him to the life. 1 ooi
David is dead enough now, as are Wright, Rouse, and
others of the old crowd.
The weakest point about David Christie Murray’s
“ Chums” is said to be its bookiuess : its characters have
a weakness for coming down to the footlights and talking
by the yard, while the crowd in the background swell the
numbers of the unemployed. Then the first act is the
strongest, the third act the weakest of the three. As toi
the story, an Auckland critic gushingly says ; It is one
of the tenderest and most pathetic little things that ever
emanated from the brain of a novelist —a very poem m
prose. A story that must touch the hearts and move the
spirits of all, by reason of its powerful humanity ; a story
of passionate love contending with truest honour, ot
childish love and confidence, of tenderest pity and sincerest
sympathy.”
Harper’s Monthly, June, brings to mind a romantic
elopement of yore, in w'hich two Australians
were concerned —W. S. Lyster and Mrs. W. S. Lyster,
professionally known as Georgia Hudson, the Pocahontas
in that famous burlesque of John Broughams, at the
New York Olympic, when he acted Powhattan, and
Waleot was his companion in drollery, A la Snazelle and
Leitch. Harper gives an engraving of Brougham and
Georgia Hodsoa in Pocahontas, which Mrs. John wood,
now of London, afterwards made so popular. Lyster was
a humble sort of man about the theatre, when he and
Georgia went West one fine afternoon, leaving the
Pocahontas burlesque to take care of itself. Brougham
and Waleot gagged it without the heroine.
Mrs. Bernard-Beere and Mrs. Langtry are both very ill
—fast train, high pressure, express.
“ Ruy Bias” burlesque, London Gaiety, has run 250
nights, always with the placard “house full.” What sthe
good of leaving London ‘/—unless there is paperhanging .
Augustus Harris has boldly and successfully introduced
French opera in London. Italian opera is on the down
grade. Melba prefers the French, and the French prefer
her.
When Melbourne people said Signora Baratti ought to
lie in London, old Biscaocianti said, “Dey grows on every
bush in Italy.”
Helen Hart, the much-advertised woman-lecturer, has
been successful in prosecuting a \ ictorian provincial pub-
lican for refusing her accommodation. Miss Hart la}s
a horsewhip on the table, like Lola Montes, who started
to flog Seekamp, the journalist, at Ballarat.
G. R. Sims says he does not believe there is any living
Englishman or American who can give Sir Arthur Sullivan
another “ Pinafore ” or another “ Mikado ” to set.
It is stated that the cause of Gilbert and Sullivan’s
apparently hopeless falling-out was a squabble about a
roll of carpet. This must be untrue. No two men of
equal position and opulence ever fell out for such a trum-
pery cause. If you hate a man you seize the first con-
venient pretext for quarrelling with him. The carpet is a
mere pretext.
The Melbourne police are kicking against theatre duty
being confined to a few favoured ones. Nights are too
cold just now to sleep them out on beat. The bright,
warm theaytur, and home at 11.30. is a preferable kind of
late duty.
Melba has been singing for Tummy at Marlborough
House.
On dit that J. C. 'Williamson has offered the Kendals
£6OOO for an Australian tour, presumably of six months,
which, with four months spent in coming and returning,
would be almost equal to an absence from England of one
year. As the Kendals made five times as much in a
shorter period in America, they decline, preferring to tour
the provinces.
The S.F. Press is almost unanimous in saying that
English representations of English theatrical stuff have
been on a gradually descending scale in America, and that
with the London Gaiety Company the very bottom has
been reached, for than ’their matter or manner nothing
could be worse.
Peter Baker, the Dutch comedian (of Baker and Farron),
is doing well at ’Frisco Alcazar. He will be followed there
by Nellie McHenry, also known here.
. Sims Reeves has been singing Gouraud’s songs into the
phonograph for American circulation.
Henry Irving was recently appealed to on behalf of his
old colleague, G. F. Sinclair, and a* once responded.
“ Tell Mr. Sinclair to draw on me for a hundred a year
during the rest of his life.”
The experimental matinee is now the only manner in
which the unknown British author can gain the ear of the
public, or ensure an after run of his work if successful. A
matinee production never costs less than a hundred
pounds, sometimes twice the amount.
Editor Stead, the irrepressible, got into curious trouble
for photographing the Ober-Ammergau play, from the
front. Caiaphas, the high-priest, happened to be acted
by the Burgomaster, who had Stead arrested. Stead
proved he interfered with nobody’s rights, and was privi-
leged with an introduction to the Virgin Mary, the
Burgomaster’s daughter.
Sir Morell Mackenzie receives £l3O per lecture for an
American tour. His son is an actor, and he’s a little bit
of a one. “Come and see the man who saw the hinside
of the Hemperor’s thorax.”
Vivier, the once-famous French-horn player, was so un-
nerved by Lord Houghton’s blowing his nose at a critical
moment of his performances, that he threw up all his
London engagements. “Ah,” he would say after this,
“ the English have terrible noses; they remind you of the
Day of Judgment.”
Nemo Dramatic Club lately produced “ Pygmalion and
Galatea,” at Sydney Royal Standard, to a tolerably full
house. It is almost needless to say that W. S. Gilbert
didn’t dive into mythology in the interests of this club
—had he done so he would certainly have introduced a
few horse-ebupers and boarding-house slaveys into the
cast. Mrs. W. E. Sheridan (Louise Davenport) as Galatea
played effectively and looked very “ fetching,” but the
weak-kneedness and woodenness of the supporting
amateurs made the whole performance most depressing.
It is understood that the next effort of the club will be
melo-drama, namely, “Sweeny Todd, the Demon Barber.”
The St. James’ Gazette says that “ alike for beauty of
voice and perfection of style Madame Melba is certainly
the first artiste of the present day.”
In Pinero's “Cabinet Minister,” the minister’s secre
tary, a ridiculous person, is named Mitford. As this
happens to be also the name of an estimable man who in
real life has acted in that capacity to four ministers, the
dramatist has made a change.
It is more than amusing, it is highly gratifying to those
behind the scenes, to note the new-born vigour with which
a writer on a Sydney daily righteously slangwhangs the
fellow scribe on a contemporary whom he was previously
understood to view with veneration.
George Grossmith left the Savoy Theatre after a twelve
years’ engagement, chiefly, he says, because he could not
endure the monotony of the long runs. That's all very
well, but if Grossmith has not more originality than the
usual single-handed showman his life will be still more
monotonous now. Were it not for the introduction of a
young wife, Monologuist Maccabe would be playing from
exactly the same bill to-day that -he hung out over 20
years ago at the Egyptian Hall.
Sarasate, the famous violinist, the modern Paganini,
who will shortly visit Australia, was born some say in
Sarragossa, others in Pampeluna, in 1846. He first ap-
peared in London in 1874.
Ida Herbert, the Australian actress, will play Octavia
in “ New Lamps for Did,” a not particulary refined farcial
comedy, through the English provinces.
Myra Kemble returns to Australia in the Orizaba.
There is room for her here—there are only about half-a-
dozen actresses capable of playing “ lead ” in the country
Augustus Harris, the lessee of the Theatre Royal, Drury
Lane, has engaged Emily Fitzroy, formerly of Sydney, to
take the part of Virginie in a forthcoming production of
“Drink.” Hum! The very clever Australian actress
who created the part of Virginie in Australia - we refer
to Jenny Watt-Tanner, as an actress miles ahead of the
chilly, not to say somewhat wooden, though well-favoured,
Emily—lately returned from London unable to get a good
opening. Kissing goes by favour.
Robert Kennedy, son o’ th’ auld mon, having seceded
from the Nellie Stewart Company, is giving the Brisbane
people “Twa Oors at Hame.”
The directorate of the Paris Opera have offered Tenor
Jean de Reszke a salary of £6OO per month. He had
previously refused £6OO a week to tour the United States.
Josef Mayer, the Ohristus of the Passion Play, could not
perform at the late Oberammergau festival owing to tooth-
ache, and his place was taken by Thomas Rendl, usually
the Pilate.
A Miss Mabel Stephenson, said to be of Australia, is
making herself a name in London society as a “ hud-
warbler.” She is said to be 16 years old, has a slim and
slender little figure, an elf-like prettiness and charm, and
the foot of a Cinderella, which she shows with exquisite
modesty in a dance that sets her very little behind Kale
Vaii»'haii. She is, however, doubtless an American, from
her lunch-eulogised delivery of an American dialect poem.
Her mother has refused for her many music-hall engage-
ments, and allows her to perform in drawing-room enter-
tainments only, at present at all events.
R. S. Smy the has taken the Opera House, Brisbane, for
the Show week.
Mrs. L. J. Lohr (Kate Bishop) presented the genial one
with a fine daughter on Monday last. Both are said to
be doing well.
An enthusiastic admirer of Nora, in “A Doll’s House,”
says of her impersonation that she is more than A church
—she is a cathedral.
Arthur Garner has received a cable from his partner,
J.C.W., notifying the latter’s return from London on the
27th Aug. to Australia.
American managers are now looking towards Australia
as a probable field for “ oof.” Rudolph Aronson’s brother
arrived here by the Alameda the other day to prospect the
chances for an opera company from the States to include
Lilian Russel, Pauline Hall, &c., &c., with “Teddy
Solomon as conductor, while “ Nadgy,” ““The Black
Hussar,” and other operas will fill the hill. The antici-
pated expense is somewhat large, and may or may not act
as a frightener.
When D'Orsay Ogden landed in ’Frisco lately he was
struck with a brilliant idea, and that was, to produce
A STAKE IN THE COUNTRY.
CITY PROPERTY MAGNATE: “BUT, MY DEAR SIR, UNLIKE YOU, I
HAVE A STAKE IN THE COUNTRY.”
J. JONES: “YES, I’VE ’EARD TELL SOME OF YOUR RELATIVES COT
’UNG ’ERE."
“ Fan on the Bristol.” The local managers humoured his
bent around saloon bars, but eventually D'Orsay got
badly left.
Johnny Oourlay thinks of returning to the States,
where he was so successful of yore. By the way, his old
“ pard,” Louis Harrison, was nearly killed in a railway
accident in California lately, and, strange to say, had his
life-policy in his pocket at the time.
G. H. Snazelle has an idea of travelling to the land of
the almighty dollar. When the Bouillihaisse boom is
over he might get right into the soup there.
Mrs. Potter, as Juliet, uses a dagger sanctified by having
been used by Mac ready in his productions of “ Romeo
and Juliet.”’ Bellew won’t have to deliver the Mabspeech
for another ten years—the Romeos always struggle hard
against the relegation to the Mercutio. Mrs. Potter also
uses a ■ lamp from Verona, very old, which might have
figured in the real Capufet mansion.
Patti is suffering from a had throat,- and has been
ordered, for the first time in twenty-five years, not to
sing.
It is said that Athena Claudius, who graduated with
George Rignold, and is now with 8.-and 8., is a sister to
Lady Charles Fitzgerald. Fitz. is brother to the Duke of
Leinster. And who the deuce is the Duke of Leinster?
They are raising money in London for the widow and
children of H. C. Sidney, who died not long ago at
Waverley.
On the morning after the first performance of Con-
ductor Cowen’s “Scandinavian” Symphony in London
Dr. Louis Engel (the now notorious seducer), then musical
critic for the World, wrote the following suggestive
note:— “Dear Fred,—A question— frank, as usual.
Would you prefer me to say nothing about your concert,
or to speak my mind freely about your Symphony ? I
candidly tell you Ido not like it. Tell me which you
prefer.—Yours truly, L. Enqbl.” Cowen declined to take
the hint and curtly replied: “Write just, what you
please.”
When you see in a theatrical advertisement “The new
scenery by So-and-so,” it means so much as is new, but
Hennings is painting a good lot again lately.
The absurdity of the youthfulness of the Virgin, in the
Ober Ammergau Passion Play, is pointed out, as she
would be 53 at the time of the Crucifixion.
A curiosity in Melbourne iv building is uncovering an
old dead wall from theatrical and business-posters of 30
years ago. On the other hand, some builders were so im-
patient that they covered up a wall lately with the posters
of our day, to be embalmed for future times. In 1990
they will wonder what Bellew and Potter, Bill Rignold,
and the great Blandes (Holt and Edith) were like.
An American actress has informed a grinning high
gartered mob of females—“ How to prevent wrinkles m
stockings ! ” Now, an American journalist calls on some
humanitarian to instruct him “ how to prevent holes in
socks.”
Barry Sullivan would not let his Richmond, hi “ Richard
H 1.,” take any other part in the piece, though he is not
on till the last act. Barry thought the combat enough to
exhaust the energies of any ordinary actor, frying and
Bancroft were instructed tor their splendid fight, in Hie
Dead Heart,” by M. Bertrand, the eminent swordsman.
Why has the noble exercise of fencing, in this sense, all
but died out in Australia ?
Jefferson, in bis autobiography, writes of Charles Kean,
and meeting him in Melbourne. During Keans fust
week of acting, Jefferson met him in Albert Park one
morning, sitting on a bench, and gazing disconsolately
towards the ocean. Kean said he was sorry he had come,
for he and his wife were too old, Barry Sullivan damaged
them bv persistently acting the same plays, at the Royal,
after he had announced that his liberal offers must in-
fallibly bring Mr. and Mrs. Kean and G. V. Brooke to ins
theatre. Kean said his wife buoy ed him up, but, in achat
with her, Jefferson found she was much distressed. He
pays a high tribute to her, as a lady and an actress.
A sensation is caused in Km-lish religious circles by a
book written by a Miss Povey about Seventeen Vears in a
C. of E. Convent, run by “Father” Ignatius. It is a
hideous record of cruelty, knocking “Maria Monk” clean
out. One penance is for the nun to become a doormat,
and lie down at the chapel-entrance, while all the nuns
and monks walk over her. The Sister Superior used to
have Miss Povey stripped to the waist and flog her with a
cat-o’-ninc-tails till s ic was black and blue, and her back
shocked her in the looking-glass? From all this we pre-
sume Miss Povey meditates a lecturing tour. The Bulle-
tin can recommend a good manager, which his name is
R.S.S.—hilt hold ! advts. in this style, £4 per inch.
However white an actor’s hair may he he will always
put on a white wig for an old man. Never thinks himself
old enough. Watch this.
Melbourne grocers are supplying their customers with
neat little note-hooks, bearing on the “ gelatine ivory”
covers a portrait of Mrs. Brown-Potter. Some of them
may be embellished with visions of Bellew, for all we
know. Any way, it is a neat advt.
John Norton, the Protectionist candidate
for Hartley, N.S.W., has been defeated by 31 ! I
votes by John Hurley, whom financial difficulties
forced before his constituents again. This election
has not been (as is assumed by the Foreign-trade
press) a true test as to the relative popularity of
Protection and what in N.S.W. is impudently
called Freetrade. There is no more off-handed
and personally popular man in Australia than
Hurley, who is thoroughly well-known and well-
liked in the district, even by the Protectionists ;
while his opponent was, comparatively speaking,
a stranger, with little or no money at his back,
and who, as Ins candidature was for several
reasons resented by the National Club, re-
ceived but lukewarm support from the
leaden of the party he ostensibly represented.
The fact that Mr. Norton had, on a somewhat
memorable political occasion, acted for Sydney E,
News in the constituency and had done the work
of that shifty and ungraspable Foreign trade
paper with apparent enthusiasm considerably dis-
counted his chances. Then, Norton is a newly-
converted and fanatical teetotaller ; while Hurley,
who concedes the right of every citizen to take his
beer, and denies the right of the publicans to State
compensation, strikes a fair balance between the
liquor-disputants. The Parkesites have managed
to get (in the main) the teetotal vob> though
believing not in teetotalism.

The Genesis of the Australian Buffalo.
Dear Bulletin, —What glorious sport I used to
think buffalo-hunting, when Captain Mayne
Reid was my boyhood’s author, and, in fancy, I
roamed with him over boundless prairies, living
on buffalo-hump ! When 1 came to hunt buffaloes
in North Australia I found it, however, quite a
different matter. The first I tumbled on I took
for a bunyip, and so did my horse, for he turned
and sprinted for half-a-mile ere it was possible to
remonstrate with him. The object of his alarm
was the animal known in India as the “swamp-
buffalo,” and life in Australia has,not improved
him. He’s a mean-looking beast, with a pair of
preposterous horns, fixed on to a body .about the
size of a boar built on a liberal and long-legged
scale. Further, he appears to be slightly imbe-
cile, and when the sun gets hot he goes and soaks
his head in the nearest mud-hole, and, when dis-
turbed, starts up and looks around with bloodshot
■eyes and half-a-load of grass or weeds hanging
round his head. As an immigrant he first came to
the colony in 1825, and was introduced to Mel-
ville Island, and 'Raffles Bay on the mainland,
where a few were left to shift for themselves
after the departure of their white sponsors.
Melville Island is now pretty well stocked
with buffaloes, but shooting-parties who ad venture
there from Port Darwin find their sport rather
interfered with by the natives, who, ever since the
days of King, the„navigator, have been remarkable
for aggressiveness. Somehow the buffaloes and
the aborigines have lived on distantly-speaking
terms, probably on account of a. similarity of
colour, but since the abandonment of Fort Dundas
(in 182!)) no white settlement has been formed on
the island, and only an occasional visit has been
paid thereto by shooting-parties. At Raffles Bay
and Port Essington, the two spots where settle-
ment was attempted and buffaloes acclimatised,
the unfortunate quadruped has not led such an
easy-going existence. Sometimes people are
assured that a fortune lies in the smoking and
curing of buffalo-humps, tongues, and skins, and
then he is pursued and slain forthwith ; but after
awhile, the bold hunter gets tired and then the
buffalo is once more left in peace. But there’s
none of the Mayne Reid business about it. No
headlong gallops side by side over the billowy
prairie, firing into the lordly leaders of the herd.
Hunting the buffalo in North Queensland is not a
bit like that. You’ve got to mess about to get
within shot, and kneel down on a green-ants’ nest
to take aim ; and, if you hit anything, you must
hump the proceeds over miles and miles of devil-
devil country.
At the same time that the buffaloes were left
to the tender mercies of a strange continent
'a number of Timor ponies were also abandoned,
and they likewise have thriven in a small
and modest manner. By the same token, two
convicts also took their departure at the time of
the evacuation : but apparently they did not
increase and multiply, for nothing has been heard
of them from that day to this. The Timor pony
of the north of Arnheim’s Land is nearly as un-
satisfactory as the buffalo in appearance. He is
larger than a big Newfoundland dog, but not
much ; he is generally an albino, and if he wants
to get rid of you he does not buck, but stops,
ducks his head, and draws back suddenly, and
you find yourself unexpectedly sitting on the
ground with a cream-coloured fiend with fiery
pink eyes gazing sternly at you. The buffa’oes
have not sprei d widely, 1 1 icy filled up a bit of spare
country in the neighbourhood of Pert Essington,
and then stopped. Single animals, generally bulls
which have been chivied tint of the mob, find their
way into other parts and take up with cattle for a
bit. One travelled right round the Cfulf of Car-
pentaria to the Queensland border; and they have
been seen and their horns found in the blacks’
camps low down on the Daly River —towards the
mouth of which there is now splendid alligator-
shooting. There is also a legend that a buffalo
started down the overland telegraph. He got
nearly as far as Tennant’s Creek Station, when he
was unexpectedly met by a repairing-party, one
of whom was up a pole at the time. Everybody
cleared out, leaving the unfortunate man a l one.
When they reached the station and told their
wondrous tale, the Adelaide people were shocked
by receiving a message stating : “Ihe devil ap-
proaching, has already taken a linesman. Be pre-
pared.” Prayers were offered up and parsons were
jubilant at the prospect of vanquishing the evil one,
when the news arrived that the missing linesman
had turned up, and that the devil had turned off
towards Queensland.

Some thirteen years ago a company,
calling themselves the Coburg Cattle Com-
pany, after the name of the Coburg peninsula on
which Port Essington stands, took up the adjacent
land and attempted to civilise the buffaloes with a
view to the hump-and-tongue-curing business.
They*were partially successful; some 300 buffaloes
were mustered and quietened ; but expenses were
heavy and times depressed, so active work had to
be abandoned. Since then buffalo-shooting has
been carried on in a desultory kind of manner by
anybody who liked to take to it. This reminds
me that the other day I saw a station offered for
sale in the Northern Territory with 20,000
buffaloes on it. Now, I always believe an adver-
tisement because I never read one yet that did
not contain the calm, naked truth; but foY all
that when I pur base that station I shall insist
upon delivery being given, and decline to take it
over on a book-muster. Down in Western Aus-
tralia, till; other day, a man offered a-bit of
country for sale, and as a recommendation, said
there were at'least a thousand kangaroos on it.
Shades of old Heft hunters,. listen to that as a
recommendation'! Very soon we shaft have an
estate held up for admiration as being suitable for
stud-rabbit breeding purposes. On a whole
the Australian buffalo, then, is a fraud; there’s
“no romance to be got out of him, and
he’s npt. a bit picturesque in appearance.
He can get in a rage sometimes, however. ' One
of them treed a blackfellow once and kept
him there .all day. After dark he slipped down
and ran for it, but the buffalo, who was wounded,
caught him. There’s a sort of wombat up in that
country that burrows in the ground and digs
considerable holes, treacherous at times. Into
one of these the nigger tumbled, and the buffalo
fell on top of him and broke his own neck. But he
punched the life out of the unfortunate native, and
their bodies were pulled out together. The Far-
Northern buffalo-hunters utilize the lazy blacks to
go with them and carry back the skins, &c. Until
a man carries a raw hide and a hump in it he has
no idea how much profanity he has in him.—

When Governor Norman and his Ministers
were in Cairns on a recent occasion, Donaldson,
the Colonial Treasurer, was interviewed about
midivght in the ball-room's banqueting-room by a
band of leading citizens, compliance with whose
modest demands would have disposed of the next
three-million loan in one ac". While Donaldson
was calculating the probable consequences of
murdering the whole deputation, a genial old
gentleman cheerfully remarked that “nothing
would be obtained from the Treasurer until they
filled him up with whisky ! ” It so happens that
Donaldson never drinks whisky, but he said, “If
I chose to take whisky I could put any man in
the district under the table ! ” The beard of the
old gentleman fairly curled with indignation at
this reckless imputation on the capacity of the
district. “By Heavens,” he said, “1 will under-
take to booze you up myself ! ” Then he sent a
messenger round to all the eleven hotels to know
how much stuff was in stock among the lot.
About four o’clock in the morning he was heard
informing the other “leading citizens” that
“ thersh shonly shix dray-loadsh whishky in sha
townsh —whash the yoosh o’ that! ”

Among the present Queensland Ministry
are two strict cold-water men—Donaldson, the
Treasurer, and Powers, the Minister for Educa-
tion. There are also two others who are currently
believed to have taken over the cold-water men’s
total liabilities.

When Miss Van Tassel, the balloonist,
took a fly-round over Maryborough, she descended
in a field belonging to a German farmer. This
Teutonic agriculturist was engaged at the time
chopping out a stump with an American axe ;
his frau, clad in the simple-garments of the female
peasant, was about 100 yards away gracefully
digging sweet potatoes with her feet. Perceiving
a dark shadow sweeping over the scene the Teuton
looked up to see what unusual bird was soaring
round tbe locality, and there he beheld the beauti-
ful Van Tassel (in tights) seated on the cross-bar
of the parachute and gracefully descending from
the clouds. Believing this to be an angel sent
down direct to scoop him up, and feeling totally
unprepared for the occasion, Hans flung away his
axe and started to break bis previous records in a
race, for home, at the same time yelling out,
several octaves above the yell of a lost new-chum,
“ Adi"! mein Gott, not yet, not yet, dere vash
muin frau-Qver dere; you gets ayay mit her !” And
the frail, with one foot buried in a hillock of pota-
toes, looked on with stolid indifference, merely
remarking; “I yonder vat de tyvil dat vash,
anvhow !”

During Governor Norman’s visit to one of
the northern sea-coast towns, a local alderman,
who took a leading part among the refreshments
all through the programme, was observed gazing
pensively at a glassful of toothpicks on the banquet
table. Then he turned to Baden Powell, the
Governor’s private secretary, and confidentially
asked him if he knew “what the blazes all them
quill pens is for ? ”
* * *
Stuart Russell, author of the “ Genesis of
Queensland,” was once 'coming down from Cecil
Plains station to Brisbane, when lie was suddenly
bailed up for money by a tall, powerful myall at
the Old Man Waterhole.” Russell produced a
pistol, much to the surprise of the nigger, who
thought he was unarmed. But the bushranger
was a myall of great self-possession and resource.
Finding a sudden change of front to be urgently
necessary, he. threw up bis hands apologetically
and called out “baal ! baal ! me pa;/ pan ! ” and
forthwith from a long coil of very dirty rag he
unrolled a penny, placed it in Russell’s hand, and
forthwith made dust and leaves fly ere vanishing
into the scrub, leaving Russell fit to roll off the
saddle with laughter.

A certain Queensland vice-regal attache
has a playful weakness for barking and crowing at
a banquet during periods of applause. This .eccen-
tric Plantagenet asked a sarcastic Queensland girl
at a ball recently if she heard “ his musical inter-
jection at the supper?” “I did, Captain,”replied
the fair daughter of the North, “and it struck me
that you -wouldn't make cither a second-rate
retriever or a third-class rooster !” Then there was
a lull in the conversation.
# # #
Some time ago Judge Pope Cooper was
travelling bn the coast north of Townsville, and
stayed for supper at a bush'hotel. The publican
had received intimation after dark that the judge
would be in to supper about ten o’clock. He had
no fowls of his own, and there were none to be
bought; in fact, the only poultry in the locality
was possessed by a rival publican about fifty
yards away, who owned, among others, a big
Brahma rooster, whose evening perch was on a
scrub-tree in the back-yard. This bird was seized
in the midst of slumber, his dying voice stifled by
rude hands, and at ten o’clock that night he was
served up to Judge Cooper with caper sauce and
baked sweet potatoes, washed down with cham-
pagne. Next day the owner of the bird was
offering a pound for the scalp of the native dog, or
fifty pounds for the Chinaman ! He had never
even caught a sniff of the burning feathers ! The
judge would do well to carry his own fowls, as
well as his own champagne, when travelling
among the pioneers of an advanced civilisation.

HOGMANAY IN GERMAN.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was a forlorn party of teamsters who were en-
camped one New Year’s Eve, some 17 years ago,
at the Lanco Crossing, on the road between Cape
Shorter and Gumgum. The rains had come weeks
before their usual time, and the Lanco was up a
banker. They were on the Turretpan side of the
Lanco, and they had no grog. Most of them were
of Scotch extraction and this was Hogmanay ! No
wonder they were gloomy.
I was then in a billet which involved my fre-
quent travelling between Tingaling—at a “skew-
off ’ from Gumgum—and Merivale, a station about
60 miles equidistant from Cape Shorter and Gum-
gum. On this particular evening, I arrived from
Merivale at Turretpan, which overhangs the
Lanco, with a knooked-up horse, named Boko, and
with full determination to reach Gumgum before
the New Year had fairly dawned. The owner of:
Turretpan was known as “Cranky Rodwaite,”
and was a perfect terror to most travellers, on
account of his surliness and inhospitality. Erudite
himself, he lived the life of a recluse, so far as a
station-owner living on a public track could act
the hermit. He had a beautiful wife whom
visitors saw only at a distance, and who was con-
sequently exalted by imagination into a perfect
Cleopatra. Rodwaite had a mania for German
servants, though he was himself an Englishman.
His stockman was German —and a very poor
stockman. His “ married couple ” were Germans.
Nothing but German was ever spoken in the Rod-
waite household; nothing but German on the
station, except when uni-lingo’d visitors compelled
Rodwaite to utter the hated Anglo-Saxon. I had
gained his favour by listening several times, with
an intelligent face—smiling when the inflections of
his voice hinted that I ought to, and looking glum
or wrathful according to inspiration—to long
harangues in German as if I understood it,
whereas I have but the schoolboy’s smatterings of
the simplest Teutonic sentences. So I had actually
once dined en famille with Rodwaite —and, by the
way, had to pretend to have “fever ’n aiger in
order to avoid answering in German.
Being anxious to get on to Gumgum on this par-
ticular New Year’s Eve, I went straight to Rod-
waite and asked him to lend me a horse. He was
in an amiable mood, to judge by his face, but he
replied with a lot of gutturals which I understood
to be queries as to why I didn’t prefer my request
in German, and then he indicated something with
a sweep of his hand which I boldly interpreted
into the gracious answer that I might “ take
Trumpeter from the home paddock.” On spec., I
went and caught Trumpeter, transferred poor
Boko’s saddle and bags to him, and it must have
been all right, for Rodwaite wished me a distinct
“(/tiien abend.”
I rode straight down a steepish track to the Lanco
Crossing and found the river right up. I suppose
Rodwaite had warned me—in German-that such
would be the case. Here I came across four sets
of teamsters, eight men in all, who immediately
swarmed on me with queries relative to Hog-
manay. Alas ! I could not help them, but re-
membered that a few miles back I had overtaken
Jim Macpot, the hawker, who was going to camp
at this very “the nicht.” I told them
this, and since I had wasted so much time in bor-
rowing a horse in German, I guessed that Macpot
was “ close up.” Presently his waggon came
round the base of the hill, he having taken a lower
track—probably to avoid Cranky Rodwaite. We
let him come right on and turn out his one moke.
Then we rushed his tilt,
“Got any grog?” , ,
“ Not a blessed drop; sold out the last bottle of
brandy at Whiteman’s to the caretaker.”
“ anv pain-killer?”
“ No.”
“ Got any ohlorodyne?”
“No.” i • *
“Why, you’ve not got anything ! And this is
Hogmanay !’’
“ Go and ask Cranky Rodwaite for some.’
“ He’s a teetotaller; go yourself.”
“ I had, meanwhile, been rummaging over Mac-
pot’s stores, and suddenly cried, “ He’s got a
easeful of scents, boys. All scents are made with
pure rectified spirits !”
“ Trot’em out. ”
And out those scents were trotted-eau-de-
cologne, lavender waters, opopouaxes, “juices of
Mount Hermon,” and the Old Scratch hiinse f
knows what else. The teamsters bought Macpot
clean out.
All the perfumeries were poured into a bucket
which a moment before had been ■ mptily hanging
under one cf the drays; the bucket itself was
swung over the lire, and a hot jorum there and
then compounded, sugar being added to give it a
relish. One super-artistic brewer added some
“ Berwick’s Baking Powder,” to, as he said, ‘ put
a head on it! ”
With this nauseous compound—it was indeed
detestable ; it makes me ill even now to think of
it—we celebrated Hogmanay, and sang “ Auld
Lang Syne ” and did many other signs and won-
ders. We got “fou eneuch ”in very short space.
Soon, however, I began to think of swimming
Trumpeter over the flooded Lanco crossing, as the
sun’s rays were levelling. Witli my faithful old
Boko, it had always been my habit to strip naked,
tie my clothes high up swag-like on the pommel
of the saddle, lead him in—he was a splendid and
a nerveful swimmer, of pure Anchorite breed-
put the reins under an armpit and go ahead
slantingly. I seen many men swim horses
by holding on to their tails. I never could under-
stand the trick of it, though I tried several times,
so I stuck to my Boko method whenever I had to
tempt the flood.
I tried it on with Trumpeter. Now, whether it
was the perfumery, or some trick- on the part of
the ranting Scots, or Trumpeter’s own cusseducss,
I never knew. But the brute broke away from
me somehow directly he lost bottom, plunged back
to the Turretpan bank, and raced up the Turretpan
hill as fast as he could head.
And he had all my duds on the saddle ! And
the top si ip rail was always left down, I knew !!
I asked the jovial opoponax-drinkers to lend
me some clothes —“only a pair of breeks, for the
love of heaven”—in order to go after the horse.
I beseeched, I cursed, I threatened, I raved, I
wept. The teamsters wouldn’t; Macpot, the
hawker, wouldn’t. The joke, they said, was too
good to spoil!
In despair, I started up tlie hill, naked as the
most innocent savage. I ran all I knew, in order
to get there, maybe, before anyone observed
Trumpeter's return.
No use. The cantankerous moke was parading
proudly in front of the home verandah with Rod-
waite and Mrs. Rodwaite looking down at him !
If he had been a trained and performing circus-
horse, he couldn't have fixed up a hotter situation.
I rushed at the position, sprang recklessly on his
back, yelled out something about “ calling only for
mv clothes,” and raced him downhill again full
split.
Arrived at the camp exhausted with the ordeal,
I threw myself on the ground and called loudly
for more opoponax-mixture. Then I related to
the others the details of naked intrusion, and—we
had more opoponax-mixture. Suddenly we heard
a step and saw Cranky Rod waite, wrathful and
malignant, and bridle in hand. Hurling some
German epithets at me, he took my bridle off
Trumpeter, put on his own, oast off my saddle
and bags to the earth, and turned to lead the
moke away.
Then up sprang I —“ What shall we do with
him, boys? Duck him? Strip him and escort
him home ? ”
“Gie him some Hogmanay, * suggested one.
The idea was fire-fat to us. Around that un-
fortunate man we ten howling, Hogmanaying
fiends circled, threateningly—one holding out a
pannikin of “ Hogmanay,” and all declaring that
wo wouldn’t let him go till daylight next morningif
he didn't drink it.
Ho drank it. What sort of German he
scrambled out afterwards, we couldn’t tell for
laughing at the grimaces he was making, and the
manner in which he contorted and writhed las
body. So we let him go.
I stayed at the Lanoo Crossing all that night,
and early next morning went up to Turret pan,
bridle in hand, and a swelling in the head, to
catch Boko. I had just got him when Rod waite
came along and confronted me. I was too sick
with opoponax to “sass back,” or analyse
his eloquence. The German gutturals fell in
thunderstorms of artillery from his lips ; the
modulations of his passion ranged from the roar of
the sweeping blast to the shriek of the cyclone’s
fringe; but I only looked at him stupidly and
meekly. When he stopped for breath, I, from a
stump, got on birebacked Boko. Again his voice
reverberated with Teutonic thunder. I kept on
gazing dazedly at him. At last —and in English! —
“Can’t you understand German?”
“No.”
“Then”—a mighty pause, in the vain effort to
clutch sufficient invective, and a clawing at no-
thing in the air—“then, Damn !”
I rode do wn the hill.

There are great masses of gloom in these
colonies since the news arrived that Carnarvon
had departed to join the procession which flits
incessantly through the misty golden door ; and
despair is lying around in immense hunks and
conspicuous blobs of grief are everywhere. Several
hundred people have gone into mourning on the
unhappy occasion and are a prey to corroding
care. They were all persons who were intimate
with the lamented Carnarvon when he visited
"Australia a year or two ago, and used to drop in
and see him every time they were passing. He
looked on the whole lot of them as a brother,
and he frequently urged them to run over to
England and take pot-luck in his ancestral
halls and be introduced to the family. They
all spent many happy evenings with the deceased.
and when the night was sultry Carnarvon used to
prop the window open with his coronet, or the
title-deeds of his vast estates, with an unobtrusive
affability that was touching in the extreme ; and
then he would order up the drinks, and tell them
to make themselves at home. Four hundred and
twenty two of them were the most intelligent in-
dividuals the late earl ever met, and the entire
crowd habitually addressed him by his Christian
name. Most of them gave him some valuable hints
which he promised to embody in an Act of Parlia-
ment whenever he got home, but unhappily Death
came in and cut him off just as he was about to
begin. He frequently stated that if he had known
375 of them when he was young his political career
might have been very different, and there were B'J
in particular who, he felt sure, would stand by
him in any emergency. They all feel now that his
confidence was not misplaced. Also, there were
, enough of them to fill eight omnibuses to whom he
mentioned regretfully that he wished they could
take his place in politics aft°r he was gone, and
the grief of this lot is something too inexpressible
to mention. When an ordinary person flies it is
a common thing for him to “cast a gloom, but
the shade that Carnarvon has cast over thi s country
is altogether too large for words.
Old Hegarty, who leased the ancient Syd-
ney (Queen’s Theatre for some years, was prone to
dabble in speculations which were not always
successful. A friend cf his once induced him to
buy an infallible egg-preserving composition which
he (the friend) had just invented, pointing out
that through eggs lay the way to fortune, for they
were only ninepence a dozen just then, while in
the winter months their selling price was at least
half-a-crown. Hegarty espoused the idea with
unction and bought up every egg in Sussex-street
without delay, and turned the theatre for a time into
a produce store, where he and his assistants were
for ever dipping eggs into some mysterious liquid,
and thenre-casingthem. This mighthavebeengoing
on till now, were it not that the first-purchased
eggs soon began to odorise so lustily that Eggarty
suddenly suspended operations and came very near
suspending his friend, the inventor. As for the
eggs that remained fresh, or partially fresh, he,
with the assistance of his company, speedily ate
them, but the bad Tins he didn’t know what to do
with. They were fast ruining the name of the
theatre, too; when the curtain rose o’ nights,
the audience in the stalls usually rose, too,
and the stench was so powerful that the Ghost in
“Hamlet,” usually a ponderous and very palpable
person, might have been wafted along on it with
the aid of a blacksmith’s bellows at a distance of
at least three feet from the ground. Just then an
alligator came to town and Hegarty, hearing that
the favourite food of the saurian in captivity was
hen-fruit, went round and sold a number of oases
to the owner at a loss of scent per cent, on first
cost. Returning, after xn interval of some
days, in order to trade off the remainder of
his" stock, he was compelled to force an entrance
through a strong effluvium which was ringing the
bell and taking money at the door. Inside he
found the alligator in convulsions, while the pro-
prietor, with tears in his eyes, was applying mus-
tard to the pit of the unfortunate animal’s stomach.
The eggs had been a death-blow to the Queensland
native, and while Hegarty contemplated his pur-
chase with a view to his compulsory engulphment
of an article somewhat out of fashionable use, his
spirit passed peacefully away one afternoon just as
the inspector of nuisances was wrangling with the
owner of its scaly tenement about the shameful
state of the premises.

And it only needs a trial to prove their great
value. They are applied externally and can be
worn'with perfect comfort and ease, generally

In Asthma, Bronchitis, Rheumatism, Lumbago,

the little complaints that grow into big ones
through improper treatment might be avoided by
wearing one on the chest and another between the
shoulder blades. Never has such genuine testi-

Ibsen and His Critics.
Dear Bulletin,— “ Marriage is a hard way of
earning one’s living ! ” This remark I once over-
heard from a conversation between two married
women touching the blessings and curses of the
marriage conventional. It sounds cynical to the
ears of the “ Mrs. Generals ’ of everyday bread-
and-butter existence, content with skating on the
safe edges of life's ice-floe, who shut their eyes to,
or overlook witli a purblind insistence all that
they do not desire to sec. Considered as a mode
of earning one’s living, marriage is one of the
hardest. The billet of the small'domestic and
petty petticoat appanage to a man’s fuller and
mo re vine life is neither advantageous to the
prospects nor ennobling to the character of the
permanent retainer of little more than a mans
name with the respectable prefix of “Mrs.” _ Iho
bond of union is usually nothing beyond a signa-
turo to a formal-looking bit of paper. a plain band
of meaningless metal upon a certain finger- of the
left-hand - emblematic of the left-handed relation-
ship of the average married woman to the pio-
blems and pleasures and penalties of life and
little beside. Woman married in the purely con-
ventional sense, is so much tangible 1 jo*
perty, a sort of funded echo who holds
• omewhat the position of the Greek slave
advanced to be the pasha’s viz.er, petted
and played with when the tyrant is in a
good humour, calmly put aside as a thing of
no meaning, a costly toy of little use, when the
veal contingencies of life arise, obtaining favours
by wiles, and power by studying the weaknesses
and pandering to the vices of the lord and master,
if not altogether,of life and death,, at least of life
and happiness. Woman pliys the part, in the
conventional marriage, of a doll, a plaything,
something which must attune itself to the mood or
the caprice of somebody who loves to play with
dolls, to dress dolls, to exult in their waxen
beauty with all the pride of proprietorship, and to
lock them up securely when wearied of the play.
Sometimes the doll disappears in the drudge; but
not often does the wife hold her head erect as a
being whose life is no less to her than that of the
man to him. Not often do we find a man who asks
for a mate a human being, thinking her own
thoughts (with a right to them), responsible for
her own actions, the architect of her own life; and
all the insanity of woman’s-rights, female fran-
chise, et hoc genus orine, is the blind, mayhap
foolish protest of women who feel that
there is something wrong without knowing the
real error of their position. Social philosophers
and psychological novelists, and dramatists in
morbid pathology refer the trouble to various
manifestations of that which cynics sneer at under
the name of love, and moralists denounce as im-
pure passion, and police-court reporters allude to
in descriptive epithets of many varieties of slang.
Everywhere amongst the most civilised commu-
nities is evidenced a vague unrest at the position
held- by woman in the marriage relationship.
Everywhere legislatures have brought under con-
sideration the necessity of extending the limita-
tions of the divorce-laws, and during the past yeai
or so Europe has been stirred to its social depths
by the performance of Henrik Ibsen’s “A Doll’s
House,” and more recently by the publication of
Tolstoi’s “Kreutzer Sonata,” and the alleged awful
drama by the same author, “La Puissance des
Tenebres,” produced simultaneously at Paris and
St. Petersburg. All these works deal with the
marriage problem as it is presented in modern
highly-civilised and conventional society. Tolstoi
writes as an Oriental who denies love, as a pessi-
mist who considers that paternity is a crime, and
regards as eminently desirablethe winding-up of the
human race on aee unit of its being a dark and
disastrous failure to discover what life means after
scienee-knows-not-how-many centuries of failure.
This is the teaching of “La Puissance de Tene-
bres. ’ Ibsen, on the contrary, cynic, enthusiast,
and reformer as he is, sees ahead to a possible per-
fectibility attainable only by the wholesale demo-
lition of conventions, the elevation of labour, and
the freedom, mental and moral, of woman. In
drama after drama he has dealt with phase upon
phase of what is rather vaguely called the “Woman
Question.” In the “Doll's House’’—just now a
bone of contention amongst the newspaper critics
of wheresoever the play has been produced, Sydney
included —he insists upon the necessity of the
ideal union of man and wife—if the race would
have any sort of healthy continuity of any kind
whatsoever. This, too, he does in the most scien-
tific manner, in a style which is cold as ice and
pure as snow. He wastes not a single word.
Every sentence tells, and the work is as cleanly
cut as an anatomical study reproduced in plaster
by a master of the modeller’s art. if the play is
read with the mind awake and all its faculties at
full tension, one conclusion is forced upon the
reader—the absolute need for the freedom of
woman, intellectually and morally ; of the volun-
tary union, which must also be the sum
of all the forces which find their adequate
expression in the marriage resting on other
than upon modern conventional grounds. But
what, after all, is the “Doji’s House?” We
find a great deal of stress laid by Old-Mother-
Grundyish critics, or criticasters and cpiticlmgs,
upon a “stocking” incident. This sort of thing
is beneath contempt, and matches well with the
Superficial “propriety” which is spread, like a
very thin layer of rancid butter on a very coarse
piece of bread, over the whole of life’s three-and-
sixpence per gallon copal-varnished veneer. The
incident in question is perfectly natural, and
emphasises Nora’s absolute perturbability of mind,
her ignorance of what is passing around her, and
the absorbing anxiety with which she contem-
plates the crux of her position. But what, after
all, is the “Doll’s House?” Here it is in a
Sentence of Jean Paul Richter’s -. —
But, before and after being a mother, one is a human
being; and neither the motherly nor the wifely destina-
tion can overbalance or replace the human, hut must
become its means, not its end.
This is the sum and substance of all that Ibsen
so artistically presents to ns in a really epoch-
making study. One do not call it a drama,
a play. It is a sketch, a psychological dis-
section in dialogue of a very high order. It may
not amuse. Does JEschylus amuse, or Goethe?
Does Shakespeare amuse, or Victor Hugo ?
These are the giants of the theatre. Calderon is
terrible. The magnificent Elizabethan drama, of
which the lightest achievement is a colossus over-
towering a pigmy compared with anything done
in the English literature of the stage since its grand
death-agony in Shirley and Ford and Otway, is
stuffed with tragedy of a sombre and awesome
grandeur. Yet we are told that the province of
the playwright is to amuse. In other words, we
have, at the summit of our civilisation, grown so
small that we can in cold blood consecrate two,
three, four hours of our night’s existence to inane
giggling. Ibsen doesn’t giggle, and can make
people think only! Herein lies the reason that
he must be hounded off a stage which unfolds its
spacious wings for the harbourage of leggy inde-
cencies and burnt-cork banalities. Consider the
“Doll’s House,” and the lesson of it. A wife,
brought up—as thousands upon thousands of
women all around us are brought up—to fill the
part of a sort of domestic female jeste*, echoing
the genteel vulgarities of a conventional, narrow
albeit gentlemanly husband, who is crammed
with selfishness and high-flown commonplaces
of no particular meaning, commits a crime—as
crime is regarded in social circles. In other
words, her husband is ill and poor, and her father
is dying. The doctors tell her that only change
to a wanner climate than that of Norway—ltaly,
for example—can save him. Money is needed !
Her father is too ill to be consulted in the matter.
Her father must die; she is confronted with the
possibility of losing also the husband she so dearly
loves. Goaded by the purest affection she forges
her father’s name to a document by which this so
necessary money may be obtained. Had her
father been in a condition to sign this docu-
ment she knows well that he would have done
so. Here begins the tragedy ! The forgery is
discovered by the man who advances the money.
The sole object of her life is to keep this discovery
from her husband’s knowledge. Not because she
fears to face the consequences of her crime. Oh,
no! She doesn’t even know it is a crime. Did
she not do this thing from pure love? Was it not
her father’s name that she forged ? Nevertheless
society is inexorable. She knows that some sort
of punishment, of disgrace, follows an act of this
kind. She fears, not for herself, but that her
much-loved husband —for whom the fault, if
fault it be, has been committed —will take
upon himself the responsibility, the shame,
the infamy, and she exhausts all the re-
sources of intrigue in her efforts to keep the fact
A G-REEDY MAN.
LITTLE BOY (passing with his father) loq.: “AIN’T THAT A GREEDY MAN, PAPA?
HE’S GOT ALL THE SEAT AND WON’T LET THE YOUNG LADY
HAVE ANY.”
a secret. Otherwise, her life is not very heroic-
She is petted, spoiled, played with, like any fool
of a doll of all the thousands who lead dolls’ lives
in all the civilised cities of our modern world. She
was taught by her father, from her cradle, that he
stood to her as God, conscience and propriety. She
is taught by her husband that a woman’s one
function is to be pretty, cheerful, and echoish of
her masculine master. She worships this husband
of her’s. He is only common, very common mud,
and she gilds him over with the gold of her
imagination. The climax comes ! The forgery is
no longer a secret between her and the mitn who
holds her father’s supposed bid. The husband is
informed, andthe'gold tumbles off the mud image,
and all her trust, confidence, and unwavering
devotion in and to this man fade into diaphaneity.
He scolds like a Billingsgate fish-fag, and displays
a littleness of soul degrading to a Bosjesman. Then
the holder of the bill relents. He will not make
the matter a public scandal. Thereupon the hus
band also relents, and informs disillusionised Nora
“that all is right as right can be.” She does not see
the absoluteness of the right and revolts. She feels
that her marriage has been a linked lie, a legalised
bodily degradation. She has lived with a
“ strange man,” she has begotten children bearing
his name, and the whole affair has no surer
foundation than the baseless fabric of a dream.
She leaves him, simply because she refuses to lead
a life which to her means degradation. The hus-
band of her fancy, her imagination, her
idealisation, is dead, and a pitiful, snivelling,
conventional puling cur, whose highest concern is
“ What will people think ?” stands before her in
all his realistic vulgarity—for the first time in her
life now truly realised —so small in his infinitesi-
malness of soul that she hardly sees him. So she
quits ! Who would wish her to stay after such a
climax? Who would desire between man and
woman any bond at all but that of an absolute
sincerity based upon a mutual knowledge, a
mutual sympathy, an identity of all those feelings
and passions which make a mai - riago something
more than a mere legal contract founded upon the
laws of property, tradition and primogeniture?
None surely but the “ Torvald Helmers ’ of the
cult that gathers with much show of superficial
ceremonial around the shrines sacred to the
goddess of a skin-deep faith—the Mrs. Grundy of
our modern, rotten, insincere and tottering
civilisation of shams, fakes, and artifices.
FRED J. BROOMFIELD.
Advt. from Auckland Herald :—-
To the Editor. Sir,-With reference to a birth notice
which appeared in the Herald yesterday, 10th, announc-
ing the birth of a son to the wife of J. Johnson, of Gis-
borne, I beg to state that the lawful wife of J. Johnson,
of Gisborne, is residing in Auckland. I think it is only
just to myself that this correction should be made. -
Mrs. JOSIAII JOHNSON. Auckland, June 11,1890.
What that ecclesiastical stock-exchange,
the Church of England, is coming to in England :
“What a splendid place these Roman Catholics have
got!” I remarked. “ Where is the Church of England
place?” “That he it, sir,” the man replied ; ' 1 that be
the parish church.” It was difficult to believe one’s
senses. The altar was a mass of light. Something like 50
or 60 candles of different heights were blazing away
amidst flowers and cunningly-arranged brasswork. At
the side, boys in surplices swung incense-dishes, and the
attendant priests bowed, twisted—aped the “genuflec-
tions of the many-pointed worm,” as Oliver Wendell
Holmes has it—and crossed themselves at intervals. The
nice little choir-boys in white and black came in proces-
sion, carrying a brass cross which was held aloft, while
others carried banners of various designs. Even the sexton
who opened the doors wore a long arrangement like a
black smock frock and had a girdle tied round his waist
like an ancient monk. When the congregation chn>°
out, the chief priest, vicar, rector, or whatever his
designation may he, came out with them. He was the
most laughable-looking figure I ever saw. A man cf
rather tall figure, he was dressed in black petticoats,
which came down to his feet; and the wind blew them
amongst his legs in comical fashion. Over this he wore a
'white surplice of half the usual length, and a sort of cape
over that. His face was clean shaven, and his hair trimmed
like a horse’s coat, while upon his head rested a black cap,
shaped like a three-cornered apple’ pastv. As he walked
through the churchyard, men doffed their hats, women
curtseyed, and children bowed low. and looked very
frightened. This is a fair specimen.of the usurpers who
have got possession of an English parish church—a church
kept by money extorted from the land and the people.
For six years the little kingdom of Greece
has been unable to procure an executioner from
among its citizens. During that time twelve
criminals have accumulated, and as nobody will
demolish them for any cash consideration, the
Government has at last agreed to pardon one of
them on condition that he kills the other eleven.
Most of the company refused even these terms,
but at last one —the meanest man in Greece —was
persuaded to accept the billet. The last Greek
execution took place in 1881, when some long-
standing arrears were worked off in the same way
—a person who had chopped his wife to fragments
behind the kitchen-door, and then said that some-
one else did it, being induced to officiate. The
Greek doesn’t rush after the job of obliterating
his fellow-man as the Englishman does, in fact,
things are so bad there that the officer now doing
temporary duty is being taken round under a
military escort, and even then lie has to be en-
close! in an iron cage to keep off the bricks that
are fired at him by everybody who sees him.
Also, the, soldiers have to hustle away a good
many people who try to prod him with red-hot
pokers through the bars of his residence, or to
poke him with'long sticks tipped with nails; and
when they are unable to get at him they call him
bad names instead, while he gnashes his teeth in
his hen-coop. A country which cannot raise a
stipendiary murderer has. left in it much that is
worthy of its immortal past.
The saying, “There is nothing new under
the sun,” is trite but true. In such a modern
“discovery” as Massage we might be excused if
we thought we bad some new thing, and yet a
reference to the library of Mr. Alfred Hamburg,
the eminent and well-known Masseur, of 112
Hunter-street, Sydney (close to Macquarie-sUyet),
proves that Massage was popular with the Chinese
3000 years ago; that the Laplanders and .Finns
employed it in pre-historic times; that the Japanese
looked upon it as a daily necessity ; ihat ancient
Germany held the treatment in the highest rever-
ences and that in the time of the Caesars the
Homans were “massirt ’daily by beautiful female
slaves, while all classes .used the treatment perhaps
less attractively, .but none the less effectively.
All reasonable members of the medical profession
now freely acknowledge the immense virtues of
“Massage,” and in-obstinate nervous, rheumatic,
and such like casts advise their patients to
have recourse to some reputable “Masseur.”
Mr. Hamburg- has been highly favoured in this
respect by all the leading medical men of Mel-
bourne, where he first rested after many years of
probation under the most prominent continental
Masseurs. The writer has seen scores of letters
and acknowledgments from these gentlemen and
from persons of the highest social rank in the
sister City, all couched in the most complimentary
language bearing witness to Mr. Hamburg’s fit-
ness for his work and the-success of his treatment.
The principle of Massage is entirely opposed to
our traditions of rest to every inflamed part, and
consists of a combination of procedures, which are
intended to rouse distorted and passive parts into
a natural condition of activity and health and
largely through the removal of abnormal deposits by
mechanical means. •
lii connection with the advertisement of
The New York Life Insurance Company appear-
ing on the front page of our present issue, we
desire to call attention to the prodigious growth
of this Company. For instance : The total amount
of • premiums received, 1880 to 1884, was
£9,177.163; and during the last five years, viz.,
1885 to 1889, £18,574,348. The amount of new
business last year written was £31,094,463, which
speaks for itself. Another conspicuous feature in
their statement is the interest received on invest-
ments, which during last year gave a daily
income of *2581. The income from interest and
rents has averaged 5J per cent, on its investments
for the past 10 years ; yet, so carefully are its
assets invested that only about one-half of one
per cent, interest on its investments remained un- -
paid Ist January, 1890, and a part of this was not
yet due. At that date the market value of its
bonds and stocks was £828,452 in excess of their
cost. The striking merit of the American In-
surance Law is the Tact that the State
is, so to speak, responsible for the sol-
vency of the Life Companies. The rriost
rigid accounts are exacted by the Government
department which has charge of life assurance
business ; and these accounts are closely scrutinised
by the officers of the department itself, all of
whom are trained and certificated actuaries. The
whole of the investments and securities are set out
with full detail in the Government issues; there-
fore the security of the New York Life is unques-
tionable. As new adaptations of insurance
principles have been worked out they have been
embodied, some in one form of policy, some in
another. But this company now embodies in a
single policy all the most notable and most valu-
able features which life insurance experts have yet
discovered. The improved methods introduced
and perfected by this office seem to be revolu-
tionising the business of life insurance here.

Institute,

Founded for the Treatment of Nervous, Skin

the Only Reliable Medical Ins itute in Austral-

DR. JENKINS
Treats sucessfully all forms of Nervous,
Chronic, and Private Diseases, no matter of
how long s anding or however compl'cated.
TO THE UNFORTUNATE
Who through ignorance and folly have trifled away
their strength, become ambitionless in life, en-
feebled in power, and to whom existence is scarcely
bearable, Dr. Jenkins says
COME. AND BE HEALED
As the terms upon which patients are treated, viz.,
NO CURE NO FISE, enables all sufferers to avail
themselves of this remarkable opportunity of
obtaining a speedy and effectual cure. Dr. Jenkins
wishes it to be distinctly understood that he’does
not rely upon the issue of books, more often never
written by the persons whose names they bear, and
are mere traps for the unwary, but honestly and
straightforwardly treats his patients according to
the dictates of a sound medical training.
