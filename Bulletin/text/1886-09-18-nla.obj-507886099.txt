SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 1886.
The “Glorious Twenty-sixth.”
Suppose Mickey Cruncher, known now as
the “ Honorable” Mickey, should call all
his friends together —Potts and Darling
Pointers, Government House and the Navy,
Barringtonia and Caringtonia, and after
feeding them well should address them in
this style “ A feast, ladies and gentlemen,
should not be without an occasion, and the
occasion should not miss mention. The oc-
casion of my poor effort is the commemoration
of the most important epoch in my history—
the day I was lagged—the toast I propose to
you is ‘The Day I was Lagged.’” What
would be thought of Mickey, what sort of a
flutter would there be amongst the assem-
blage, what lifting of eye-brows in Caring-
tonia, what quakings of heart in Barring-
tonia ! Would not the wretched old man be
voted mad or so naked of common decency
as to be shut out of “sassiety” for ever-
more ?
* * *
Yet what is the difference between the
Hon. Mickey in such circumstances and the
Hon. Premier, whoever he may then be,
rising to propose the toast of the occasion on
the 2Gth of January, 1888, the date appar-
ently fixed by general official consent for the
celebration of the Australian Centenary !
The day we were lagged, there is nothing else
in it—the day Governor Phillip ranged his
men on the bit of open ground by Sydney
Cove, 600 male and 250 female convicts,
three captains, 12 subalterns, 24 non-com-
commissioned officers, with the doctor, store-
keepers, overseers, floggers, and the parson,
pitched in as a mere afterthought, on the
eve of departure from England, through the
kindness of the benevolent Mr. Wilber-
Eorce. Six hundred men with traces of
gaol-fever, and scars of foul disease ; 200
females, the scum of London streets the
men handcuffed and dog-chained from waist
to ankle, the women fettered to a long
chain, and the Governor, a good man and
knowing his business well, reading therna good
practical sermon on the necessity of mending
their ways and saving their backs. That is
the true picture, the plain tale of the matter,
and what is there in it or about it to demand
or justify any rejoicing ?
Some few people in New South Wales
have, doubtless, excellent reasons for re-
membering that day in their prayers. Their
ancestors took the Governor’s advice and
founded fortunes. But they did not found
a State Let us be as clear and emphatic as
we can on this head. The clank of those
chains across the beach and up to the edge of
the wood did not accompany the first act of
the making of the Australia of to-day. That
planting had to die—to be choked out, in
fact —before anything that might be called
National life began. For it is indeed true
that for the half-century of convictism
through which Australia passed we were not
a rising nation, but the sink, the cesspit, of
England, Ireland, and Scotland, and the
contempt of the world. The bad seed sown
did not change its nature at all. Ten years
after this marvellous “ birthday,” New South
Wales was peopled by about 4000 convicts,
1500 soldiers and overseers, and a few
free folks who hoped to make a fortune by a
brief sojourn in the southern Hell. Morality
was unknown, religion held generally in con-
tempt, the officers of the precious New South
Wales corps, the old convict guard, picked
the moat attractive women from the cpnvict
ships and lived with therq in Open cotlcu-
hinage. Non-commissioned officers came
next, and a well-behaved convict might get
some old harridan to take out to his grant
and begin the propagation of “the Australian
race.”
* * *
Ten years later that most unlucky governor
Bligh tried in his rough way to purge the
Augean stable, but the swine, loving their
own fat rank garbage, rooted him out, and
Macquarie came and turned on the rum-taps
again, and built up such a glorious condition
of Liberty that in the eleventh year of his
reign, the thirty-third of our alleged history,
he caught a party of men and women picnic-
ing on his domain, and tied them up and
flogged them without judge or jury.
» * *
And what had we done in twenty years
more ? What was our condition, our repu-
tation ? Was it not customary for decent
folk in .England receiving relatives from
Australia, or from Botany Bay rather, to
pray them to conceal their connection with
that undesirable place, which was, indeed, in
worse odour than ever was Nazareth amongst
the Jews ? Botany Bay and Yan Diemen’s
Land were vigorous in those days, Australia
and Tasmania were unborn. The true Aus-
tralia, indeed, is even yet unborn. True as
beautiful is Brunton Stephens’ poem begin-
ning :
v She is not yet—but he whose ear
Thrills to that finer atmosphere—”
And when through whatever shock and
strife, with flux of blood, and test of Are, the
union and birth foreshadowed takes place,
the “ Day We Celebrate ” will come and will
be kept with the pomp it merits and the honour
it deserves through all the cycles of time.
* * *
Out upon this 26th of January, 1788, say
we, with its clank of fetters, crack of whips,
thud of gallows-traps, odour of gaol-fever, vice
and brutal, beastly licentiousness—Mount
Rennie, Mount Carmel, and Woollooihooloo
outrages are its only legitimate offspring, a
crude and cruel barbarism lingering in law,
a cringing meanness or a stupid assertiveness
amongst labouring men, and a coarseness of
mind and manner amongst “ their betters,’’
its chief traceable influences. If we are ‘ ‘ stuck
for a day let us take that on which the still
living Hargraves drove his pick into the
gold-reef, or, better still, that other when
old John West came over from Tasmania,
and William Stawell came up from Vic-
toria, and with Robert Campbell, Charles
Cowper, and old Doctor Lang —blessed be
his brave memory !—unfurled the starry
banner which drove the curse of convictism
from our shores. That was indeed a great
day, a worthy, and in the true sense founds •
tional day, almost large enough to justify the
apt quotation from Carlyle: “A commu-
nity or a nation once raised to a white heat
of enthusiasm is thenceforth considerable in
all its remaining history.” That is the birth-
hour to be noted and acknowledged and
commemorated, the white-heat of enthusiasm
wherein true national impulses are born, and
as yet we have no such day. America waited
200 years for hers, and outlived—be it re-
membered—a beginning wherein were mixed
tho elements which were served out undi-
luted to us. And, unless we are determined
to be run by tuft and title-hunters, show-
men, and bagmen, and diplomatic tools, we
had better also wait, and when the time
comes speak, and, if necessary, strike, and so
well that the echoes of our words and blows
shall come to all our posterity cheeringly and
inspiringly through all future years.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
That Illawarra Railway.
The Legislative councillors of New South Wales
have appointed a committee to enquire as to
whether the railway to Kiama should go into that
town or keep outside of it altogether. But this is
only one of the conundrums, in connection with
this very much bungled line, which demands solu-
tion. Exceeding it in point of importance is the
question of station-site, and the desirability of
placing it upon or adjacent to the estate of
Samuel Charles, Esq.,M.L.C., or on that of one of
his near relatives. And more important still is the
fact that what was once the fifth section of the
Wollongong to Kiama line, has now become the
first section of the line from Kiama to Jervis Bay.
But as it is not likely that any evidence will be
called for on this latter point, it may interest tax-
payers who have to pay for Ministerial and official
incompetence to know that, as the amount voted
for this Wollongong to Kiama line was inadequate
to the extent of & 250,000 or so, the ingenuity of
responsible parties solved the difficulty by chop-
ping off the Kiama end of this section and adding
it on to the Jervis Bay line, so that, as a matter
of fact, that quarter of a million has been twice
voted, and the transferred length of railway twice
provided for. Members and the country alike have
been cleverly hoodwinked (to use a gentle term),
and a disgraceful blunder has, by the means de-
scribed, been carefully hidden. As the onus of
disgrace attaching to this transaction at present
adheres to the Minister who is responsible to Par-
liament for the acts of his officers, it will be neces-
sary for him to publish the full facts of the case,
unless he is content to let it be believed that
he approved of and even directed the use of this
very questionable stratagem. From first to last
this Illawarra line has been an outrageous job.
Surveyed through lands already secured by in-
fluential syndicates ; its construction suspended to
allow further enquiry as to whether it might not
be “ profitably” diverted ; driven through lengthy
tunnels in order that it might pass near certain
estates ; to be completed in one part 18 months
before the preceding section can be used; and
varied as to its sections in order that money
might be twice voted, the line offers every tempta-
tion in all its history for the exertions of an en-
terprising political detective. Conceived by the
spirit of unholy avarice, born of log-rolling and
malfeasance, and growing up in the shadow of
interminable and gross bhindering, the 111 a war r a
Railway stands as a monument of Ministerial and
official incapacity, negligence, and perhaps crime
against the Constitution of the colony.
A Slant-eyed Daily.
When will the Sydney Daily Telegraph learn
to argue relevantly 1 In dealing with the alleged
brutal outrage by certain young white beasts upon
a helpless girl in Moore Park, it drags in the
Chinese question and as much as says that because
the outrage was not perpetrated by Chinamen we
have no right to agitate for their expulsion from
this country ! What in the name of goodness has
that got to do with the matter ? By such idiotic
reasoning wo have no right to exclude lepers from
our midst or put a ship in quarantine because
some of ourselves have got the toothache, or a
bilious headache, or are lying sick of scarlet-fever,
or the effects of too much beer, at the hospital.
The Bulletin never stood up for absolute perfec-
tion in the whites. It knows only too well that we
have many criminals amongst us who are as
degraded as men can be, but because we
have such that is no reason why we
should allow the Chinese to evade and defy
our criminal laws, or swell our criminal records,
or make our manners more corrupt. The whites
are bad enough themselves, but they are ever so
much worse by reason of the presence of the
Chinese. After all the question is not so much a
question of morality as one of protection of rights.
Australia belongs to the whites by right. White
brains, white energy, white labour, and white
capital have made it what it is, and a share in its
wealth is the birthright of white people. The
Chinese bring no capital into the country, and
they take away annually, besides, £600,000
of solid capital from New South Wales alone
—which is a yearly “backhander” for the
colony. What they gain we lose. Individuals
suffer just now, the nation will suffer ultimately.
The Chinamen exist through the selfishness of
some whites who practically share their plunder
with them. We cannot reach those white rob-
bers —those traitors in the camp—but we can
reach the “yellow spoilers,” and demand that
they shall forthwith depart.

Two Million Pounds !
Once more and with much regret do we feel com-
pulsion to subscribe ourselves Advocatus Diabolus.
For an old man died a couple of weeks ago and
there has been constant effort since to make of
him a saint—Mr. Thomas Walker, of Concord,
Saint Thomas by the verdict of the Sydney daily
Press and the pulpits of the city. He died worth
£2,000,000. He had been worth something like
that for years past. He had known that hunger
and want existed in the colony and the city, prac-
tically at his door. He was a churchman and
knew that the church he favoured was languish-
ing for want of funds. He knew also that all the
artistic life of the city was poverty-stricken, pining
for need of a little generous encouragement, and
yet he lived and died worth his two millions, and
the hunger and want remained unappeased. He
gave £lO,OOO once in one year to various charities
—£lo,ooo out of two millions, a fraction maybe, of
one year’s surplus, a portion of what remained
after satisfying his every want, and the drum
ecclesiastic in pulpit and in press was beaten about
it, and the whole world summoned to do homage
to a charitable man. A charitable man, forsooth!
The tradesman who gives five shillings to a
hard-up mate is a thousand times more de-
serving of the title. There is no charity
without sacrifice, and sacrifice unless to himself
Thomas Walker never made. As many another
rich banker, merchant, and agent in the city, he
had ground the bones of victims innumerable to
build up his golden mountain, upon which he sat
through all his later years impotent and joyless,
simply a barrier preventing a vast supply of fer-
tilising wealth from doing its proper work in the
world. He must never get into the calendar of
the good saints. Martin, who divided his cloak
with the beggar; Christopher, who gave all
his great strength to carry poor folks across the
ferry, could never live in the same heaven with
him. He will need purging through a half-dozen
more lives before he is fit company for the saints
who know the full meaning of the simple Scripture
“It is more blessed to give than to receive.”
Among the “charitable” ones he was, perhaps,
the best, but, after all, how much of charity did
this man of millions show ?
♦
Something to Jeer At.
Mr. Harold Stephen’s Bill for the abolition of
flogging was jeered at in the New South Wales
Assembly and practically ignored by the daily
press. Let us put before the public a few of Mr.
Stephen’s points—and our own. New South
Wales is a colony whose Government pays £lOOO a
year to floggers and hangmen, and yet haggles
about giving £5OO a year to the Art Society. It is
a colony whose Parliament but the other day
enacted that a man whose sentence of death had
been commuted to 15 years’ imprisonment might,
in addition, be twice flogged—the wise Sir Alfred
Stephen (who, by the way, was a Crown Prose-
cutor in the refined and high-toned colony of
Vandemonia 50 years ago) being apparently of
opinion that a man who had not been deterred
from crime by the prospect of hanging would be
deterred by flogging ! Under section 446 of the
code, stipendiaries may, for a “wanton assault”
(committed possibly during a pot-house brawl), or
for obscene or blasphemous language (! !) —the for-
meruttered, itmay have been while the offender was
Tlrunk, the latter given expression to while he was
thoroughly sober and talking well within what he
impiously considered his moral right—order a man
to be flogged within six hours after conviction,
no time therefore being given for appeal against a
sentence passed by a couple of mere magistrates,
and which, once carried out might bring upon a
citizen utter physical, moral, and social damna-
tion. In New South Wales, under a code deliber-
ately passed by two Houses of Parliament and as-
sented to by the Crown less than five years ago,
a man’s soul may be flogged out because he
has plucked a rose in another man’s garden,
,or because he has scratched the wall of a
public building, or because he has thrown a
stone at the disgraceful carvings on Sydney
Post-office. All authorities on prison discipline
agree that only humane men should be allowed to
act as prison-warders. Yet the New South Wales
Government permits the warders of its peniten-
taries to act as floggers. “ If,” says Mr. Stephen,
“ there is one man more despicable than another
on the face of God’s earth it is he who will flog
his fellow-creatures for the sake of a few shillings.
A man who will do this is no more tit to be en-
trusted with the care of criminals than the veriest
lunatic in the asylum.” Nevertheless, the fact is
that the New South Wales Government partially
entrusts the reformation of prisoners to men far
more brutal and degraded than the average con-
vict. And this is the colony which has invited
the British Associati n to coma and inspect it !
A Cloud in the East.
During the last fortnight Alexander of Bulgaria
has risen again and then fallen with a fall like
that of Lucifer into the abyss of oblivion. Ap-
parently his courage gave way beneath the insults
and cruelties he suffered during his imprisonment,
and after a vain attempt to propitiate the Czar by
servile submission, he has resigned his throne and
disappeared from the list of reigning sovereigns.
It is many years since even a Russian tyrant has
dared to, play such a game with the crown of a
civilised kingdom, and the perpetual shuffling
which has gone on in Eastern Europe within the
last few weeks reminds us of those revolutionary
times in Israel, when one bloodthirsty pretender
after another pegged out his claim on the throne of
Jeroboam, only to fall a day or two later before
the attacks of some more daring and energetic
usurper. It seems now to be almost too late to
hope for the maintenance of peace in Europe. The
Tory Premier, at the opening of the present session
of Parliament, laid down as one of the great
features of his policy the preservation of the
Ottoman Empire, and, indeed, having virtually
expunged Ireland from the list of his respon-
sibilities, it was necessary/to run Turkey
in to fill the gap. There seems now to be
every probability that Turkey will fill the gap
very successfully. The North German G azette,
which takes its inspiration from the iron
Chancellor, calls on the Czar to start his
grey-coated legions on the road to Stamboul, and
if Salisbury is to prove himself anything better
than a petrified Conservative, he is bound, after
his late confession of faith, to stop the way. The
Turk, as Garibaldi said, “must go away to
Broussa,” but the Tories are pledged by every
promise that a Tory can hold sacred to defer as
long as possible the retreat of the Tartar tribes
into Asia. There is a close resemblance, too,
between Turk and Tory which makes the work
one of brotherly affection. In truth, however,
there is nothing to choose between Russian and the
Ottoman, and it matters little from a humane
standpoint which of these ruffianly hordes comes
out uppermost. But Lord Salisbury has under-
taken to back the red-capped murderer who be-
lieves in Allah against the other flat-headed
assassin who believes in whisky, and the roar of
cannon in the East will come opportunely to drown
the cry of an oppressed nation in Ireland, and the
wail of sorrow and suffering and rising disaffec-
tion throughout Great Britain. The ‘ ‘ spirited
foreign policy ” which Disraeli bequeathed to a
suffering nation is the perpetual device by which
his party attempt to divert attention from
British troubles at home to other peoples’
troubles abroad, and the pork-hating Mos-
lem has propped up more than one Cabinet
which had nothing to recommend it except its
insane desire to back the pot against the kettle on
the plains of Macedonia. Lord Salisbury’s posi-
tion is too precarious to allow him to stand aside
in the event of a general European war. He must
kill somebody abroad to save himself from politi-
cal death at home ; and should hostilities break
out Australia has every chance of being involved
in tremendous dangers, if not in actual disaster,
all because the rulers of a little island in far-away
Europe have sworn that the greasy Muscovite
shall not sun himself on the peaks of 'ancient
Lebanon, or prowl through the streets of Stamboul
and Jerusalem. With the present Tory programme
before us we have but one cause for genuine
thankfulness. Imperial Federation has not yet
been accomplished—if it had it might have been
our duty to guard the dog-infested capital of the
Sultan from foreign attack, and Australians
might have gained a new insight into the hydra-
headed Eastern Question while watching the
progress of the colonial levies in a campaign among
the Balkans.

Primate Barry and Socialism.
The concluding part of Bishop Barry’s lecture,
“ Christianity and Socialism,” is remarkable for
its ambiguity. From so skilful an artificer we ex-
pected a keen-pointed weapon, capable of affecting
no uncertain results upon an antagonist, but the
expectation was vain. After some verbosity on
the futility of certain undefined revolutionary
attempts to set civilisation right, the Primate
says, “ The greater and slower influence which
has already destroyed slavery and serfdom, which
has created at least the idea of universal brother-
hood . . . will yet, we trust, do its deep and
enduring work.” This greater and slower influence
we presume to be Christianity. Truly this in-
fluence is slow —but great, hardly. Let Bishop
Barry contrast the result of eighteen centuries
of Christian influence with the more secularised
influences of the present century, and then ask
himself if it really has been slow Christian influence
which has accomplished the abolitition of slavery
and serfdom and implanted the idea of universal
brotherhood. He is not unaware how Christianity
embraced the civilisation of Europe, Africa, and
Western Asia in her octopus-arms and never re-
laxed until every sign of animation had been ex-
hausted. He is not unaware how she swept from
the reach of humanity the accumulated knowledge
of ages, not slowly indeed, but swiftly and too
surely. He is not unaware, either, how, conse-
quent upon the loss of this magnificent heritage,
the portion of human race thus wronged relapsed
into intellectual, moral, and physical depravity.
Neither can he be ignorant that with the increase
of the sum of human knowledge every good quality
in man is in a like ratio increasing. Is is not, then,
strikingly evident that the diffusion of secular
knowledge is the great enemy to slavery and serf-
dom, and the cementer of mankind into a common
brotherhood ? It is perhaps needless to tell him,
though history declares it in trumpet tones, that
it is the spread of knowledge that has elevated
the character of the present-day Christianity.
That it is increase of knowledge that has lopped
off many of the unsightly excresences which dis-
figured it when greater ignorance prevailed ; and
that increased knowledge in the widest sense is
the remedy for all the evils he deplores, and
without it Christianity is dead. Doubtless Bishop
Barry ascribes the abolition of serfdom in Russia
to Christianity, but to unbiassed minds it would be
difficult to show any other cause for that step on
the part of Russia except the growing strength
and ominous mutterings of the serfs themseh es.
Let him look back at the behaviour of the great
luminaries of that section of the church to which
he is attached, as evidenced in their attitude to-
wards slavery when it was placed before them for
their judgment. If judged by their action can
it be said Christianity has destroyed slavery i It
will be found as hard to answer the brotherhood
question affirmatively.

Homestead lessee has obtained possession, and
many of them have been put to such loss by the
delay that if they could get back what the appli-
cation has cost them they would never trouble the
Lands office of the colony again. Ruinous as the
delay is to these applicants, it is correspondingly
profitable to the squatters who can run their stock
all over the areas applied for, thus getting pastur-
age which costs them nothing and spelling their
own paddocks for future use. Rain has recently
fallen in every pastoral district and caused a rich
spring of grass, but this will not benefit the un-
happy homesteaders. The squatters’ sheep

is at length granted, the lessee will find his area
as bare as a road, with no prospect of improving
until the summer heat has passed away. It is not
possible to assign any reasonable or sufficient
cause for this delay. Settlement is effected in
other young countries and colonies without any
similar dilatoriness, and as satisfactory motive or
use is wanting, the sufferers by the system will
assign a cause which is eminently unsatisfactory,

Bendigo gullies, and Black Hill leads,
Deep Greek boozes, and Shamrock feeds ;
Wo followed our shadows to seek them out,
But things have turned right round about.

And east from the sea must the new track run.”
Bully, old dad ! ” said the lads with zest,
As the long ship plunged round the cape due west.
So-long, old dad ! ” stud the lusty wag,
As ho jogged along past on his wiry nag.
“ You’ll never get up, man,” the trooper said ;
But lie pushed along nodding his old grey head.
And the noise and the chaff and the dust went by
As he said, “ Shadow points, and I won’t say die.”
So the seventh, eighth, ninth days passed, and still
Ho toiled through the sand-flats—crept up the
hill;
And the tenth day rose, and he somehow found
As his quaint, dark shadow went round and
round—
In his heart new pangs, in his limbs new pain,
And a Are growing hot in his aching brain.
So he stood on the ridge and laughed to see
The long thing point out so steadily,
Right to the world’s rim, murky and red,
Longer, more faint, till the day was dead.
Then he shivered and shook, though the old black
coat
Was buttoned up tightly from knees to throat.
And he slept by his swag, but he woke, for soon
Right out of the East came the great red moon ;
I he great round moon growing white and bright,
With deep dead eyes like the graves of night:
The great moon lifting his long grey hair,
For he rose up straight and he looked, and there
Was the long quaint shadow, and pointing back
Like Death’s own finger along the track.
And, Shadow,” he said (for his brain was hot),
He needs must perish who follows not.
Shadow, I follow, and hey, good moon,

And the white moon rose as the miles went past,
And his shadow came in, and he paused, and now
Cold sweat broke out on his burning brow.
Shadow, what means it?” The great moon

To the wretch who leaves him before he dies ;
And he dashed out left and he dashed out right
And he looked up aloft to the great still night. ’
“ None now to lead me and none to save,”
He stood on his shadow, and on his grave.

He was there when the white moon rose again,
But he oast no shadow along the plain.
And the dingo came and snuffed and saw,
But howled as he vanished with empty maw.
And the crow flapped up on the long-scent trail
But turned from the sight like a fluttered quail’-

The style in which Beach polished off his
three opponents in the sweepstakes makes it clear
enough that his life in London has not been
marred by any of those amiable weaknesses in
which champions have so much temptation to in-
dulge. The lesson of Hanlan’s champagne-train-
ing was taken to heart by Our William, appar-
ently, and he profited by it. Much as we mis-
trusted his policy in starring at the music-halls on
his first arrival in London, it must now bo ad-
mitted that William has justified those per-
formances. After taking down Gaudaur’s number
(and he promises to do so) Beach ought to he able
to do his starring all over again at an augmented
figure. He will then he champion indeed. Never-
theless, there will always be people to doubt
whether Beach at his best could have beaten
Hanlan at his best. No line can be obtained
through such men as Teenier or Wallace Ross,
for three years ago the Canadian could lose eithei
of them as Beach loses them to-day. Wallace Ross,
in particular, is a fraud of long standing. He was a
younger and a better sculler than he is now when
Laycock rowed him down with ease. On the
strength of that performance, Laycock was subse-
quently matched against Hanlan, and the letter
simply played with Ross s conqueror. these
memories of the past have to be freshened up
before we can arrive at anything like a fair esti-
mate of Beach’s recent performances. We see
that Mr. “ Billy ” Innes describes him as better
than Renforth in his best day.” It is odd that an
experienced writer like Innes should make such a
ridiculous comparison. Renforth was an oarsman
of the brute -strength pattern, who flourished in
the dark ages of fixed seats. Renforth wrested
the championship of England from Harry Kelly,
when his powers were waning. Kelly was subse-
quently beaten by Joe Sadler, who in turn suc-
cumbed to Trickett. We should judge the present
form of even Teenier to be better than that of Ren-
forth in his best day.

In running over the results of the Austra-
lian cricketing tour we think it will be found that
none of our batsmen have scored a “ century ”
against the best English bowling. Palmer knocked
up 93 in the match With South of England, and
followed this up by taking 6 wickets for 61. It
would have been well if an earthquake had put a
stop to play at the conclusion of the Englishmen’s
first innings. In their follow on they made 450.
Spofforth taking 4 wickets for 112. Considering
that the South had a ■ heavy “dead horse” to
work off, this performance clearly demonstrates
that the “Demon” can no longer funk the
Britishers out of a game.

“Democrat,” the Sydney consultation
philanthropist, who invites subscription of £ll,OOO
for three sweeps, asserts in a very much dis-
tributed circular that The Bulletin has pub-
lished a testimonial as to the bona-fides of his
enterprise. “Democrat” should have stated,
also, that the #aid testimonial appeared in the
advertising columns and was charged for at the
usual rate. No editorial comment as to the affair
has been made, nor can there be any such, for it is
manifestly impossible to guarantee the future
action of anyone who preserves his anonymity.
We have called “Democrat” a philanthropist
because it would appear from his circular that the
full amount subscribed is to be returned to
winners, “Democrat” apparently being requited
for the expenses by the satisfaction he will natur-
ally feel in being the humble means of gratifying
those who are fortunate enough to scoop the mag-
nificent pools he is now diligently preparing. A
correspondent writes to ask if The will
guarantee his investment of a little “quid” on
the affair : firmly, though regretfully, we decline
to do so. It may be genuine, and the “commit-
tee of influential public gentlemen whose names
are above suspicion ” may be all that fancy paints
them, but The Bulletin does not know them,
and would not guarantee them if it did.

The papers arc, we are glad to hear, a
little premature in their statement that Mr. D,

According to the
Sydney D.T., “in the
opinion of every good
judge, Samuels is the
fastest runner ever seen
in Australia.” Samuels
may be all they claim
for him, but it seems a
little “ too previous ”
to say he could have
given a start to Frank
Hewitt and “ Scone ”
Watson when at their
best. There is some
talk of a match be-
tween Samuels and
Malone, but it is not
likely the pair will
come to terms. It is
stated that Samuels
has left behind him in
Queensland a black
brother who can give
the Botany hero a few
yards and a beating in a
150yds. spin.

A little story re an
English sculler who
some years ago visited
Australia, and com-
peted at an up-country
sculling race. On the
morning of the race
Englishman A waited
on the kerb, while his
trainer B, who had
never left his man an
instant for the previous
fortnight, went into the
bank to obtain the final
deposit, which had to
be paid inthat morning.
Another trainer, C, was
standing at the door of a pub. alongside, and
knowing the Britisher’s failing, asked him to take
a drink. A had a big thirst on him that morning
and stepped inside, when C served him out the
best part of a tumbler of neat gm and then hur
ried him out to his place on the kerb. To this
day B wonders why the Britisher did not show up
to his training form.

Rollinson did a foolish thing in challenging
Rolfe to race for the Australian professional
bicycling championship. The match (a three-
event one) came off on Saturday, when Rolfe won
with ridiculous ease the mile and five miles’ races
in the stated times of 3min. 25 l-osec., and 19min.
9 3-6 sec. respectively. The distance was done by
the comparative outsider, Wihurd, in under 18min.
No wonder Rollinson is only the “ ex’’-champion
of America. Mr. George, before starting one of
the races, managed to put a bullet through one of
his fingers. It may come with rather a shock to
visitors to the ground to know that the races are
started with ball-cartridge.

“line’’for the event by watching the spar be-
tween Lees and “ Big Jack,” a bulky pupil of
Jackson’s. The latter got all the worst of the en-
counter, but if Lees has no better defence than
that he exhibited on Saturday night, Jackson,
who in his late show with Dooley, seemed to be a
lightning-hitter, should prove victorious—this
even in face of the fact that Farnan, whom Lees
so badly defeated, has twice beaten Jackson. The
audience on Saturday night were not much
edified by the monkey-antics and porker-like
grunts provided for them in the course of Murphy
and Kelly’s “ flash four rounds.”

About 10 per cent, of the entire Mel-
bourne population turned out to see the football
match between South Melbourne and Geelong.
The match was played on the ground of the
former club, and, with a view to preventing a
general massacre of the Geelong boys in the event
of a South defeat, police were turned on in strong
force. There was no bloodshed, however. Under
the glare of 60,000 eyes, the South team behaved
in a phenomenally dove-like manner, and the play
was “fair” throughout. Hence Geelong won
with ridiculous ease. If these matches between
rival clubs are to maintain their interest, the "V ic-
torian Football Association must take action to
prevent the importation of foreign labour by
either party. For this special occasion the Mel-
bourne division were assisted by a leading
South Australian player.

As might have been expected, young Mathews was de-
feated in his sculling-match against W. Anderson over the
champion course on Saturday last. As we stated at the

Encouraged by recent aquatic developments, it seems that
Nelson’s backers have doubled stakes for the match with

Joe Thompson made a queer investment at the last Moonee
Valley meeting. After Mabel Gray had run unplaced in a
field of four for the Selling Race, the wily Joseph claimed the
mare for £145. The winner—who carried 21b. more than
Mabel—was bought in for £35. For ways that are dark and
for tricks that are vain selling races are peculiar.

Allan G Steel, the celebrated English batsman, was seized
with rheumatism in the side during one of the Australian
matches. The doctors have been “ forbidding Steel to play
cricket any time during the last four years. A leading raem-

makes is another nail in his coffin. Yet he keeps driving

Little Gorry, the light-weight jockey, is doing a month’s
suspension for disobedience of the starter’s orders at Moonee

been reported and reprimanded, and it is to be hoped that
success is not spoiling him. However, if Gorry occasionally
loses his head at the post he has it well under control at the

SAMUELS, THE ABORIGINAL WINNER OF THE BOTANY
HANDICAP.
A Melbourne paper, speaking of the Eclipse Stakes at
Sandown Park, says that “ Cannon’s hare percentage came
to a thousand pounds." Cannon may have received a £lOOO
present from the owner, hut English jockeys are not, in a
general way, paid percentages on stakes, as in Australia.
But whether it he by percentage or by present, the mannikins
are usually overpaid. Certain journals are constantly striv-
ing to introduce the wretched system of jockey-worship over
here. This is to be deprecated.
The result of the Beach-Caudaur match will certainly he
foreshadowed by the betting. All that the poor British
critics have to do is to watch the Australian and American
practising on their river, and arrive at a dispassionate
verdict on their respective merits. There will be no national
feeling to influence the market. The prestige of Beach will
go for something, but—granted a square race and no mis-
haps—the favourite will assuredly win. Oarsmen training
on the Thames have to do their work under the eyes ot touts
by the thousand.
AT SANDY CROSSING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Like to sprites of evil omen o’er the forest harpy’s
lair —
For the blood of many victims ever cries for ven-
geance here.
Here, the half-demented shepherd perished in his
maudlin craze —
Here, the blatant horsey shearer saw his final
drinking days—
Here, the stalwart strong-lunged teamster passed
his spirit-reeking breath—
Here, “Old Bill,” the hurdle-maker, died the
“ horrors” fiery death —
“Pat the Mailman’s” whitened relics here have
found a lasting bed —•
Many a nameless wearied traveller resteth here
his fevered head—
But amongst the shanty’s victims fell mortality
may claim
One who died as dies a hero, though we never
knew his name.
But two letters rudely carven on the gum-tree at
his head
By the hand of silent friendship as we scoopcdhis
sandy bed!
From the eyes unused to weeping fell the big un-
bidden tear,
As we lowered him in his blanket from the rustic
sapling bier.
Only known as “ German Charley,” stalwart,
comely, in his prime ;
Only known his native land was somewhere by
the fruitful Rhine,
Only heard his Swabian accents wrestling with
our English tongue,
As he shouted, “I will go, boys!’’and into the
current sprung —
How with bated breath we watched him breast
the rushing river’s strength ;
One short minute seeming drawn oiit to an hour’s
tedious length—
Caught within the swirling eddies, struggling in
the flood-wrecks’ toils,
Dashed against the polished boulders where the
racing water boils;
By the whirling mudded waters like a bubble
plaything flung
To the almost submerged tea-tree where the drown-
ing woman clung—
How our ringing plaudits nerved him in his hamp-
ered backward fight
Ere the rapid rushing river took him downward
in its might.
HERE, below the river’s elbow, where the faint
and grass-grown track
Winds across the bloodwood level, stands the
charred and lonely wrack—
Blackened uprights mid the tall grass, as a gibbet
grim and sere,
Loom above the verdure’s tangle in the sunset’s
paling glare ;
Yonder, where the white ant buildeth and the
sapling grove is dense,
Past the ruined stockyard’s sliprail by the crumb-
ling dog-leg fence,
Shrouded by the wildvine creepers, in the gum
tree’s scented shade,
Levelled by the many rainfalls, many bushmen’s
beds are made.
Swift the llling years have flitted o’er the stage of
hoary Time,
Since the house of “Sandy Crossing” flourished
in its baleful prime ;
Ere the fitful tide of traffic, with its changeful
ebb and flow,
Left it bare and custom-stranded seven fleeting
years ago.
Now the prowling fearsome dingo speaks its
monody of woe,
Or the mopchawk’s ghostly hooting when the
moon is very low —
Yet ’twas only for a woman, she a pioneer oj
Shame —
left of all her sex’s glories, nothing left her but
the name—
Outcast of the Seaside City, tracking up the ven-
turous band
drawn by Fortune’s tinselled glister to the golden
Northern Land;
3ut he only saw her clinging to the tea-tree’s
fragile limb,
Only heard her shrieks appealing and it mattered
not to him
Whether tawdry Vice’s helot, vestal maid, or
model wife—
Twas to save a drowning woman, and he gave his
gallant life.
Ah ! the ruck of fortune-seekers pressing onward
day by day,
Think not of their fallen brothers’ lonely graves
beside the way;
Selfish progress ever motive as the seasons-maroh-
ing year,
Rushes forward little recking of its martyrs lying
here :
Here is one for whom some maiden, sick with hope
deferred, may pine
In some vine-surrounded cottage by the fruitful
river Rhine ;
Rest thee, nameless gallant spirit, in thy quiet
sandy grave,
Be' thy memory, aye, enshrined with the great
forgotten brave !
Here we stood in silent sorrow, as we laid our
comrade down ;
Five were youthful, lusty fellows, one was bearded,
tall, and brown.
Strong in hope—the digger’s lodestar—heedless of
the weary miles,
Fealty chasing Fortune’s footsteps for her golden
syren smiles.
One lies on a virgin sand-ridge, by the Mitchell’s
spacious flood ;
Two have gone, their lives the payment for the
slaughtered natives’ blood ;
Gone are two, by thirst and fever of the deathly
tropic zone—
Here am I, the drifting remnant, standing by this
grave —alone.

At Wellington (N.Z.) one Agnew and his

From the breezy region of Williamstown
(Melb.) comes a queer story of life and death. An
invalid gentleman fell into a state of coma, and
inadvertently impressed his friends and relatives
with the notion that he was no more. As is usual
under such circumstances (in well-regulated fami-
lies), the undertaker was called upon to measure
deceased for a wooden suit. He came, did the
undertaker, but when he arrived the “subject”
had suffered a revival and was taking his medi-
cine as before. Showing a patience under adver-
sity which cannot be too highly commended, the
undertaker meekly suggested that he wa,s always
on the job, and would be happy to execute “the
order” when it really became necessary. The
innocent hero of this story has forwarded parti-
culars to the Press. He thinks that the under-
taker’s conduct showed bad taste. The latter
returns the accusation, and the trade is with him
to a man. Their motto is “ Die, and let live.”
For one of these half-and-half corpses, who doesn’t
know his own mind, they have nothing but con-
tempt.

To an audience that was not an absolute
crusher upstairs, but about as full as they make
em below, the Holloway Company opened at
Sydney Opera House on Saturday night. “The
Ring of Iron,” “ an entirely original drama in five
acts ” (we quote from the bill), constituted the
business, and was received with perhaps a little
more acclamatory enthusiasm than its merits
required. “ The Ring of Iron ” is tragedy, comedy,
farce, burlesque, and pantomime, by turns—a
melange which enables every patron of the drama
to be delighted with that part of the art which he
oves best. The first act, wherein some 20 diggers
force a guileless maiden to choose a husband from
among them, is redolent rather of comic opera,
and would be helped along considerably by some
songs and choruses, and so forth. This act is un-
doubtedly the weakest, and if it is patiently
endured, there is no more heroism involved in sit-
ting out the rest, for the remaining scones are
strengthened with plenty of clever incident and
brightened with a modicum of humorous action
and dialogue—not too humorous, you know, but
just humorous enough.
* * *
We were not largely impressed with Mr.
W. J. Holloway’s Dr. Meredith. Dr. M. is a man
whose mission seems to be the euchreing of
vice by playing two bowers and an ace—
always in waiting up his sleeve—against two
nines and a ten held by the man of sin who is
plotting against the good and virtuous. But Mr.
Holloway, although coming down with the force
of a trip-hammer every time, and making the
most of his strong lines, is somewhat too stately
and stiff in his attitude and action for any but the
pittites ; they are with him from the word “go ”
and the way they adjure him, when opposed by
the human vice emporium to “give him Bondi,”
is indicative of strong and sincere appreciation.
Miss Essie Jenyns plays a part demanding con-
tinued effort, with a naturalness which, neverreach-
ing the sublime, yet rarely sinks to bare medio-
crity. Mr. A. Norman does the heavy villain
business with abandon, which, being of course as-
sumed, is simply wonderful. He was disappoint-
ing in that scene wherein he learns his accession to
a baronetcy ; this is possibly because he is in pri-
vate life unused to such intelligence. Charles
Holloway and Harry Hodson are up to sample
save when they are supposed to be drunk, but in
this they are as amateurish as Lyne and Clarke
would be in a prize-fight. Dr. Grant, of the Mar-
wood Lunatic Asylum, has a voice like a fret-saw
but is not otherwise objectionable. Miss Alice
Deorwyn in the first act plays an impossible part
in a way that falls short of the extortionate de-
mands of the playwright, but is all there in sub-
sequent scenes ; and Miss Kate Arden, seemingly
built for the role, deserves much kudos for her
vigorously natural performance as Nurse Bland.
Of the others more anon.

In putting on “ Never to Late to Mend ”
at the Royal Standard, Mr. Dampier appeals only
to popular support. Any piece with convicts in
it will never be appreciated by the Sydney aris-
tocracy. The realistic scenic effects are a pro-
minent feature of this play ; they are of a “novel
and striking character,” as the bill with wholly
unnecessary capitals eloquently remarks. They
are especially novel in the daybreak scene, where
the full ruddy glow of sunlight is first turned on
followed by the pink blushes of dawn, which in
turn give place to the violet and purple of day-
break, after which the sunlight breaks in again
and various native birds awake their chorus Of
the birds the kookaburra is a conspicuous and
abject failure, and it is equally a reproach and a
compliment to the company to say that there is
not a real jackass among them. We were not
altogether satisfied with the business of the gold-
field’s scene. The diggers suddenly wake up im-
mediately resolve to wash an empty dish of dirt in
the waterfall, and half-an-ounce of gold is forth-
with produced as the result. Then, after kicking
Crawley, they turn in, leaving the prospect lying
loose around. The dish is afterwards found by
Robinson and Fielding, who have to put it again
under the pump before they can find a solitary
speck. And the £7OOO nugget is a very poor
affair—we could knock a better one out of any
kerbstone in two hours, and then not work any
Taken all round, the acting is well up to the
standard of this company, and the piece will
doubtless continue to draw well,

“Truth,” at Sydney Gaiety, is a woeful
disappointment to those who have been hungering
and thirsting after veracity. It may be that it is
not the genuine article, or possibly it is so long
since we last met with accuracy in any shape that
we are unable to recognise the real, hard-baked
gospel when we see it, but we would really prefer

that our half-brother’s father by marriage is very

whole comedy—like almost everyone we have
seen lately-depends on a hideously monotonous
mother-m-law the relict of a yawning spectre
uith a moveable wooden leg, and this lady tells
how she used to confiscate that timbertoe every
mght at 10 • o’clock and weeps because all
men have not at least oi*q eucalyptus i
limb by which they can be kept under con-
trol. The rest of the story depends solely
on four sleepy-eyed tottering wretches who tell
a whole string of stupid mendacity to a party of
ladies, one uncertain and transitory dude-mule
who wilts like a blighted potato-top at the sight
of his crusher-in-law, and a lady who is weak on
mythology, and who tells her husband that the
sword of Damwhatsisname ”is hanging over his
head. Ihe four men are mild and washy rakes when
abroad and praying humbugs when at home. They
have been in London on a charitable mission which
they executed by attending a fancy-dress ball—
one as a Celt in very short kilts, the second as
that spectral form in three old hats that went
a-kissing of Kafoozelum, and the other two clothed
in some unspecified sinful garb. They arrive
home gaping miserably, and the would-be Celt
falls asleep standing while embracing his
wife with his mouth open (mixed rather, but it
doesn t matter). Of course they are found out by
the mother-in-law, and from the recesses of her
hollow and mysterious jaw issue sounds of wail-
ing like the yells of a banshee amid the halls of
(ho gloomy past. But at this crisis a sad-looking,
prematurely-young individual unfurls a large
falsehood, and the four sinners take shelter be-
neath this gingham of mendacity. Then they
take the ladies apart and tell four transparent
whoppers which make the darlings jump off
their eight little feet in joy, while the old lady
clumps round like an unbelieving elephant, and
makes observations 10 feet long, which double up
the deceitful four, and they fall on the floor in a
dissipated heap. Ultimately there is a climax,
but it is too weak to stand alone, and the mother-
in-law just catches the last train home. We were
very glad to see her go.

Mr. St. Maur, as Alfred Sterry, was at his
very worst. If he gets any worse still we will
mention the fact. Mr. Alfred Maltby took the
part of Sir Partridge Compton, Miss Powys ap-
peared as Mrs. Sterry, Miss Nelly Mortyne as
Lady Compton, and Miss Agnes Thomas as Mrs.
Macnamara, and this quartette saved the piece
from utter ruin. Sir Partridge, especially, is the

lodeeming feature of this mother-ridden atrocity,
but he tells jovial, gouty lies all through, while
his companions attempt in the end to tell the
truth, and collapse. Miss Annie Taylor took her
customary part of the rocky parent, and we would
be inclined to characterise her performance as
very good were it not that we are suffering from
female on the brain and are weary of the very
name of mother-in-law.

“ The Mikado ” perpetrated himself with
considerable success at Sydney Royal on Saturday
night in the presence of our quarrelsome, red-
nosed representative and several thousand others.
Since then he has been waving his fantastic Pagan
toe with unabated energy, and every night a large
audience has gathered to listen to the love story
of Nauki-Poo and his bride. The piece is magni-
ficently mounted, the cracked porcelain landscape
in the second act being especially attractive, and
over the whole waves, or is supposed to wave, a
shirt dipped in treacle—the imperial standard of
Japan. The beginning of Nanki-Poo’s courtship
Is, unfortunately, not in the opera, but it may be
presumed he wooed Yum Yum in the customary
Asiatic style—that is to say,
He gave her a pipe with a golden clog,
A box of tea and a poodle dog,
And a painted heart that was all aflame
And bore in blood the lover's name; ’
And she smoked the pipe with the golden clog
And drank the tea and ate the dog,
and dreamt at night of her lover’s physog, and
did everything else that a little toddling Asiatic
girl in love could reasonably be expected to do
But the course of true love is terribly obstructed
by a burly Oriental, dressed in hieroglyphics and
dado mouldings, and all through the opera sundry
shaven-headed spectres flit round under very try-

ine party sports the last

Two members of the German Church in
Melbourne excused their interruption of the ser-
vice by alleging that the officiating parson was
immoral. The plea was absurd. If service is to
be interrupted whenever an immoral parson is in
the pulpit, a lot of Sydney churches might as well
shut up altogether. It is always the fascinating
and giddy cleric who is most popular.

when “Barren Bay” was mentioned, there was
any doubt about its identity, one could always
explain by saying; “Barren Bay, alias Botany

ness about putting it in that way. It would smack
so sweetly of the “good old times.”
The Newcastle Orangemen are about to
present the “Skedaddled Nun” with a gushing
one-horse address which begins thus: “Heaven
has given you a mouth.” There is apparently a
certain amount of truth in this, for the lady has
obviously got the mouth. It is generally wide
open, too, and we are glad to learn on such good
authority who gave her the voluble cavity, for we
almost thought at one time that the address
finishes with the words, “Its full measure will
not be known till the great day ’’—but to avoid
misconstruction, we may explain it is not the
mouth that is under discussion this time.
Rev. Dr. Jefferis is just now teaching

Especially does he warn them against novels and

bad, even for Jefferis. In aptitude for similes he
treads close upon the heels of the man who likened
certain pulpit utterances to “ gas rising f rom
a seldom-flushed sewer.” It seems, by the wav
that the dear doctor was “ saved ” at the early
age of 18 by a year’s abstention from Action if
he would but abstain from fiction now, Jefferis
might, perchance, save somebody else. Who

It may take only nine tailors to make a
man but it also takes a milliner and a good deal
of red paint to make a Judge. The Australian-
born and democratic Justice Williams, of Mel-
bourne, however, objects to the lurid upholstery
which is the symbol of his office, and a week ago
actually suggested that his charge to the jury
would be as effective “if he had these rags off as
if he had them on.” For our own part, we are
inclined to think a good deal depends on what his
Honor wore underneath the “rags. ihe reel
Draconian nightgown is so long that, for all we
know, the rest of the wardrobe might, on a Mel-
bourne hot-wind day, consist only of a pair o

by a judge attired solely in shoe-leather, tie

law at present in force to provide for such an
emergency. Judge Williams, however, is alto-
gcthen, too darned particular in some respects. He
expelled a juryman for yawning a little while ago,
and fell like an elephant on a sergeant of police
for smiling at a lawyer’s joke. Still, we agree
with him on the subject of legal robes. There are
several N.S.W. judges who would be very small
beans indeed if it were not that they are togged
out in something that looks like the red bottle
from a chemist’s window, and there is hardly one
who could preside dressed only in a horse-cloth
and a pair of boots and yet keep up the dignity of
his position.

The N.Z, insurance agents are adorning a
tale about a man who resolved to insure his life,
but postponed doing so for a few weeks. Sud-

sad and striking proof that we should never put
off, &c. We once knew of a man who resolved to
buy a new bonnet for his wife, but he delayed
doing so, and in the interval the lady went off

An evicted corpse at Ballarat sends a bitter
complaint to the local paper. Her name was—
well, say Jones, and she was about to be interred
alongside her father-in-law, when the mother-in-
law objected, and refused to allow the grave to be
disturbed. The same day, however, another
Jones arranged for having his family vault opened
for burial, and the natural result was that the
dead Mrs. Jones was planted alongside a Jones
who had been no relative of hers while in the
flesh. Then the other Jones sent his corpse along
and “ slung out” the intruder before she had even
time to take root, and left her shivering outside
on a bitterly cold day, with the wind whistling
through the coffin. Then the surviving Jones
tore away to interview his stern parent, but she
was obdurate and refused to have the bones
mixed. At last, however, the widower got a
garnishee order, or a habeas corpus, or something,
and thereby overruled the old lady’s objections ;
the funeral took place over again ; and Mrs. Jones
now rests peacefully in that cold and silent
thingamy from which no what’s-his-name returns.

Cleanliness is next to Hades, or somewhere
thereabouts, in N.S.W. The Bourke Telegraph
has been reduced to sending out an expedition to
prospect round the office, an impression having
arisen that a glue-factory had been started in the
back-yard, and when the exploring party re-
turned and was resuscitated with whisky it re-
ported as follows Opposite the Commercial Bank
two departed cats, scientifically designated felis
gonebung; on a rubbish heap close by three more
cats, and one goat which had been cut olf in the

three, fragrant cats ; in Richard-street, a porcu-
pine lying stark and stiff with its martial quills
I around it, two hens stretched out in the cold
embrace of death, and yet another long-defunct
cat alongside. Many other cognate horrors were
scattered around, and more deceaseds were loom-
ing in the distance, but the search was not earned
further. And yet Bourke is only an ordinary
specimen of a N.S.W. town, and every Sunday,
all over the colony, people pray around the odour
of goat and dog and sanctity to be delivered from
pestilence and famine, &c. What a chance there
would be for a clergyman who really believed in
cleanliness to hang a decaying text by the tail m
front of his pulpit and preach a practical sermon
for once!
Some little trouble has been created in the
Melbourne University Council by the presence of
a sad-looking clay-headed image which has for
some time past been leaning its hard-baked skull
against the wall in that haunt of ancient learning.
It was a well-fed looking object with long stone
whiskers —the man it represents has red whiskers
—and a head which suggested the idea that the
hair had been eaten off by a horse, and it pur-
ported to resemble Sir Samuel Wilson, Knight.
This article was mysteriously forwarded some
time ago by some then unknown person as a
ready-made grovel by a local artist, and the
Council were afterwards astonished by a request
from the widow of the late Marshall Wood, the
sculptor, for a cheque in payment of same. This,
however, was more than the academic fathers
were inclined to stand, and they rose up as one
mule for the purpose of rejecting the effigy thus
put in upon them. It was unanimously decided
that the stone Samuel should be cast out, and a
message is to be sent to the proprietor of the
spectre to send a wheelbarrow for his Samuel and
cart him away. The resolution is a commendable
one, for there is already too little learning and too
much bust in Australian Universities. But it
seems rather hard when we recollect that the
gentleman who has been thus dumped in a hand-
cart and wheeled away gave £30,000 to build the
Wilson Hall—an addition to the very same estab-
lishment where he cannot now And a spot to lay
his plaster head in peace.

“ When you have a good thing, stick to it.” The
maxim isn’t so generally followed in the colonies
as it should be, but as a rule the legal profession
sets a good example. A good case, a promising
misunderstanding, or a quarrelsome client, doesn t
often evade the grip of the first man of law who
gets hold of it. This is as it should be, and the
best of it is that they improve as they grow older.
There are the Judges, for instance. Who ever
heard of a judge voluntarily giving up business?
A judge may be old, or sick, or stupid the latter
is common enough—but he needs to be very old
and uncommonly sick before he is stupid enough
to resign his seat on the Bench where he gets a
good deal and frequently does very little. A case in
point is reported from New Zealand. There are two
judges in Wellington, one elderly, deaf, and rather
stupid, the other very sickly and not very young.
One of them, it matters little which, the stupid
one for choice, was trying a libel-case last week,
in which a shady politician sued a newspaper
editor for suggesting that he was a rogue. The
case was interrupted by an earthquake, a bad one
even for Wellington, and the audience left. The
aggrieved politician, the high-minded journalist,
the interested audience, cleared out without
notice ; and were followed by the jury, the officers
of the court, and, strange to say, even the lawyers.
One man kept his seat. It was the Judge ! Like
the Roman sentinel at Pompeii, who stood firm at
his post, amidst the crash of the elements; so
amidst the collapse of chairs and tables in his
court, the New Zealand Judge held on. lie
mightn’t be clever, but it would take more than
an earthquake to dislodge him. He knew a good
thing when he had it.

A Mudgee paper has the following :

Mr. Piddington, M.L.C., while on the cre-
mation question recently, said “ Where would
be the interest which all England feels in the
character of that sacred sanctuary, Westminster
Abbey, if it had been the practice to burn the
dead 2” As no one seemed to know, or care, Fid.
proceeded to describe the feelings of “veneration
and awe” which imbued his mind as he “ stood on
that holy ground midst the remains of warriors,
divines, poets, painters, and statesmen. “ Sacred
sanctuary” is good, and so is “holy ground,” but
by a little further investigation Piddington might
easily have discovered that, in addition to war-
riors, divines, &c., the sanctified Abbey also con-
tained the mould of some terrible scoundrels
and all-round sinners. At the very door of the
sacred room of the Consistory, or Spiritual Court,
for instance, lies Mother Oldfield, the actress,
who, as her quaint history states, “ lived with
Mainwaring, but was the friend of Marlborough
and Godolphin,” and who, being asked one day by
Queen Caroline if Brigadier Churchill and herself
were married, replied, “Madame, the general
keeps his own secrets.” Oldfield is buried near
that model of virtue, Master Congreve, and that
angelic creature, Mr. Secretary Graggs. Ihe
presence of this godly trio near tlxc Consistory in-
spired some one well acquainted with their giddi-
ness to pencil on Oldfield’s tomb the neat hut un-
grammatical lines—
“ If penance in the Bishop’s Court be feared,
Congreve and Craggs and Oldfield will be scared
To find that on the Resurrection Day
They’ve all so near the Consistory lay."
How the genuine saints must squirm, when they
receive their N.S.W. Hansard and read that the
wonderful sanctity of a mondaine's shrine is able
to strike feelings of “ veneration and awe” into a
N.S.W. Legislative Councillor!

On one of the steamers trading from Syd-
ney to Cooktown is a French stewardess with an
abnormally keen sense of humour. Some time
ago, when starting for the North, she had a large
number of lady passengers, among whom was a
portly Jewess who had an infallible cure for sea-
Ickness. This cure consisted of a mustard-
laster partly mixed with flour and placed care-
illy over the “binjie” (aboriginal word, which,
eing translated, means the place into which the
lackfellow stokes the roast .possum). The
aughter of Judah communicated this brilliant
lea to all the other lady passengers, and very soon
he stewardess was surrounded by a crowd of
ager females clamouring wildly for mustard-
ilasters of all shapes and sizes. The Gallic
tewardess at once made an estimate of the super -
icial area to be thus carpeted with mustard, and
encluded that nothing less than a 141 b. tin would
atisfy the requirements of the epidemic started
>y the daughter of Israel. So she emptied 141 b.
>f mustard into a bucket and mixed it to the
xroper consistency. The flour was omitted for
’ear of running the steamer short of that useful
irticle of diet. All being in readiness, the
stewardess went round and took a mental outline
jf the dimension of the various plaster-reposi-
tories. There were all sizes, from the tiny little
“ chest ” that took a neat little plaster spread on
the back of an envelope, up to the ample expanse
of the smiling matron weighing a couple of hun-
dredweight, who required one spread over the
surface of a pillowslip. There was amongst
Mademoiselle’s patients a German woman who
could have carried off the gates of Gaza. Ihe
stewardess approached this Teutonic syren with
what looked like a square yard of canvas covered
with yellow paint. “ Och, mein gott, vat yas
dis 2” The stewardess smiled and laid it on its
appointed place, giving one or two trowel-like
slaps to smooth out the surface. The last plaster
was deposited, and each and all waited expec-
tantly for the balmy sleep and sweet repose that
was to bring lovely dreams and banish mal-de-mer
to the limbo of oblivion. Never before was there
such an odour of mustard in any ladies’
cabin. Even the rats refused to enter dur-
ing that eventful night. The sounds that pro-
ceeded from that cabin have never been heard
before outside of the domain of lost spirits. In
the morning the floor was paved with exhausted
mustard-plasters, some dropped gently from the
gloomy occupants of top berths and others dashed
with wild pitiless rage into any part of the cabin.
The ladies all addressed the stewardess simul-
taneously, but over the rest rose the Teutonic
voice, “ Oh, by ze Heaven, I never tinks I vas
coom alive again to-day ! ” And they all prayed
for only j ust strength enough to get up and bathe
their arms to the elbows in the blood of the
Jewess. “ I tinks I vas feel more pettcr if I coot
eat van smhall piece of dis Shewish voomans
mit some mooshtard !” And this was the senti-
ment of all embodied in the unsophisticated lan-
guage of the daughter of Germania. And what
intensified their pitiless ferocity was the fact that
they were all about ten times sicker than they had
ever been before. And for two days following,
few females were seen on the deck of that steamer,
and even those walked round gently with an air
of settled melancholy and sighed with the earnest
sorrow peculiar to people who have abandoned all
hope in this world.
If we were little Coonan,
And little Coonan we,
And we were lightly cast adrift
Just for our little selves to shift,
We thinks we’d play our tune on
Quite another key.
If we were little Coonan,

If we were an attorney,
And slightly run to seed,
And, for running up expenses,
In patibulo suspensus.
We’d take a little journey—
Methinks that’s what we’d need,
If we were an attorney
And slightly run to seed.
We’d let the row blow over—
Six months is not too long—
’Twould soon be all forgotten,
And as all the world is rotten,
While we would be a rover
Some other would go wrong,
And let our row blow over—
Six months is not too long.
PERSONAL ITEMS.
Somebody is writing a novel for Mrs.
Langtry.
The Pall Mall Gazette thinks that, with
care and attention, Sir Samuel Wilson, K.0.M.G.,
may perhaps develope in time into a good party
hack. Perhaps he may—in time, or, if time is not
long enough for the job, he may do it in eternity.
Thady O’Kane, of the Northern Miner
(Q.), announces that “ any more drunken women
calling at his ottice after 11 p.m. will be cut into
ham and eggs.” We presume from this that
Thady now attends to drunken female clients from
8 till 10.30 only.
“The Rev. G. Austin has declined
to accept the bishopric of Melbourne.” It
is, perhaps, just as well that the bishopric
of Melbourne was not accepted by the very
cautious Rev. G. Austin. A priest who as-
sumes so many airs very rarely has many graces.
Henniker Heaton on Gladstone: —“We
are called together by a crisis gratuitously in-
flicted upon the country by a scheming statesman
followed only by the ragged remnant of a mutin-
ous party.” The Cooma Express wisely observes
that Henniker’s wife has money enough to buy
aim a better speech than this, and we ourselves
are inclined to think she might stand another
tuppence to keep him from making an ass of him-
self.
It is reported that Hinder, the Tumbar-
umba (N.S.W.) bank-manager, is doing his little
sentence jovially “on his head.” He has no work
to do, no prison-clothes or prison-fare, he has a
comfortable apartment, and gets his meals sent in,
and has generally a “high old time.” Hinder
shot a man dead —that was all—and got a sentence
of 12 months. Only a few weeks ago a baker got
10 years for embezzling a few shillings. Better be
a banker than a baker.
The Archbishop of Canterbury has entered
his 58th year. “We couple with our congratula-
tions,” says a brutal English paper, “ a sincere hope
that this frontal gem in the crown of the Church
will be long spared to entertain Society at dinner
parties and garden fetes, and that his sphere of
usefulness in saving the souls of the aristocracy
over dessert or while discussing a plate of straw-
berries and cream may be constantly enlarged
during the closing years of his life.”
A petition is going round in S.A. for the
release of A. M. Wilson, the Commercial Bank
swindler, and the movement is getting very ex-
tensive support in clerical circles. Wilson, during
his career as a financial delusion, used to perspire
texts from every sacred pore, and was a credit to
the church and a fraudulent debit to everything
and everybody else, but on the strength of the
scripture which used to exude all over his anointed
hide, the Rev. Slobkins and Co. are backing him
up to the best of their ability.
Sir James Martin, speaking at Consul Grif-
fin’s banquet, described Jefferson as/ a tremendous
Radical, a man who when he was appointed Presi-
dent rode up alone and tied his horse to a post.
We would like to know what Sir James is
grumbling at. Did he expect to see the horse tie
Jefferson to the post, or did he think the post
should have fastened the horse to a stump, or did
he imagine that the President ought to have ridden
into church instead and tied his horse to the
parson 1 Some men are never satisfied.
Lord Salisbury, the present British Pre-
mier, is in a very feeble state of health. ‘‘ He has
become much more corpulent of late, and the
chronic bow in his back, which is accentuated at
the neck, has increased, while he finds consider-
able difficulty in walking up even the most gentle
ascent.” This we take to be the Tory way of say-
ing that Salisbury has become jnore|Sliff-neckea

than ever, and that he is funking at the steep
pinch ahead. Gladstone, on the other hand, is
very much alive and means to kick hard.
More Arctic exploration. Colonel Gilder,
an American explorer, is preparing a new expedi-
tion to reach the Pole on foot. He reckons that a
frost-bitten scientific procession, after four years’
clumping through snow and frost, establishing
depots as they go, may reach the Pole at last.
Colonel Gilder, by-the-bye, did not start so soon as
he intended, because he is in gaol. The only
woman he ever loved declared he should not go
away to have his scalp raked off by a walrus if
she could help it, and she ran the gallant officer in
on a charge of stealing a thousand dollars He
means to go, however, when he gets out.
From a London paper : —“ The Prince of
Wales will deal a heavy blow at his popularity if
he does not promptly quash the testimonial scheme
in connection with the ‘ Colonies.’ It is a mon-
strous idea, and its inception reflects no credit
upon anybody, except it be in the direction of
marking the person as an arch-toady. The South
Kensington shows and their developments bid fair
to culminate by-and-bye in a public scandal, and
the Heir Apparent will indeed be in a highly-
ridiculous position then, if he finds himself the
possessor of a huge present, given him in recogni-
tion of his valuable services in connection with
that self-same scandal.
Robert Bernard Dunne was the name of
the leading “ masher” at Toowoomba (Q), and he
was shining at a ball one recent evening like a
metal teapot on the hob when a detective arrested
him for getting money under false pretences, and
offered him a free passage to Brisbane. Most men
would have wilted like a blighted cucumber
under such a shock, but Dunne simply asked the
officer not to “blow the gaff,” and then intro-
duced him all round as a very dear friend with
whom he had to go to the capital at once on
urgent business. A great blanket of gloom at
once fell on the company, and a dozen ladies went
to the station to see their best masher off. They
wept a good deal, too, but they wept still more
when they learnt afterwards where he had gone
to, and that he wasn’t coming back.
The Jew who, the other day, caused such a
row in Sydney Synagogue by saying in effect that
it would be a satire on religion for usurers to hold
religious offices, has a level head. In every com-
munity the greatest enemies of the Jewish race
are the usurers, who are without conscience and
without remorse. The disgraceful revelations
lately made in Melbourne, where it was shown
that Hermann, the President of a Hebrew con-
• gregation, had, in conjunction with the grasping
Waxman, been charging young Petty 1100 per
cent, interest on large sums, should have burnt
like nitric acid into the Jewish skin. The brain
of the average Jew is too good to be prostituted
to the filthy purposes of usury. It was the so-
called Christian system which in times gone by
forced the Jew to get his living by lending money
at usurious rates; but the necessity for such
things has departed, and we hope that the day
may yet come when the Jewish community will
ostracise the Hebrew father who devotes his son
to the vile purposes of a loan office.
A Melbourne firm of photographers has
laid itself out to get a negative of Premier Gillies’
now historic “ smile.” We advise Gillies to stop
clean-shaving and grow a moustache. No poli-
tician should ever wear a clean shave unless he
has unbounded confidence, based on the possession
of an iron nerve, in his powers of lying. The liar
who is not absolutely iron-nerved is, when in a
“ tight-place,” easily revealed to the physiogno-
mist who takes the trouble to watch the
muscles of his mouth. We once knew a man
who in all respects save that one, was a really
magnificent liar, but he could never quite manage
his mouth, and so he could never deceive us. The
barrister or gentleman who “ fancies ” himself as
a liar always shaves clean ; the nervous legal or
other liar, on the contrary, lets hisface-hairgrow.
To us, one of the saddest sights in the world is to
watch a weak-nerved lawyer or clergyman or
politician, whom nature has doomed to failure by
denying him a beard, trying to tell lies and impose
on us. The philosophy of the whole affair is that
the liar who shaves must have plenty of cheek.
“ Coo-ee,” a volume to be shortly pub-
lished in London by Patchett Martin, will be
strong in poetry. It will give to the world hitherto
unpublished verses by Lindsay Gordon and Marcus
Clarke ; something from the pen of Dr. Moloney,
of Melbourne ; and a gurgle (rapture!) by the
Jawbone Neild of the realms of alleged poesy—
Sladen. It will also contain what Mr. Martin
declares to bo the “ finest poem overwritten in
Australia ” —author, Gerald H. Supple, the short-
sighted Melbourne journalist who, many years ago,
in trying to shoot his supposed enemy, the late
Mr. G. P. Smith, shot another man, Walshe, and
was for many years thereafter kept in gaol. The
magnificent defence made on Supple’s behalf by
Mr. (now Judge) Higinbotham, is a matter of his-
tory. In prison, Supple wrote a poem, referred to
above, entitled “ Dampier’s Dream, or the Dawn
of Australasia.” There are to be prose contribu-
tions from Mrs. Campbell Praed, the now eminent
novelist, who was a Brisbane girl; and from Mr.
C. Haddon Chambers, of Sydney, whose pretty
story, “ The Pipe of Peace,” lately published in
the Argosy, has been so extensively re-printed in
Australasia.
The “ Duke’s Daughter ” discourses again
in the Town and Country Journal, Prince
Albert Victor being her subject this time. “ His
simple honesty,” is one of the attractive sub-
headings of Beltenbrosa’s slush, and on looking
for particulars we find the “ honesty” was chiefly
manifested on one occasion when he sat like a
solemn skeleton and gazed around while every-
body else was laughing at a good joke. In any
other individual this would have been pure,
shark-headed stupidity, but in the case of the
heir-presumptive—or rather presumptuous—it
was “simple honesty” which prevented him
laughing at a joke he did not understand. The
“Jook’s” offspring also tells a pretty little anec-
dote about Prince George, the younger brother of
this gorgon, who, while yet a nasty little boy,
many years ago, came to dinner in a state of un-
adulterated nakedness, and then she winds up
with some moral reflections, among others being
the following: “Heaven has conferred, even on
the inferior people, a moral sense, compliance
with which would show their nature invariably
right.” This is not “ Peeress,” however, but Con-
fucius, for the “daughter of aJook” has been
reduced to borrowing from a 2400-year old China-
man to fill out her correspondence.
Some time ago, a gifted Australian author,
whose latest work is now enjoying a wide circula-
tion in boot-trunk-making circles, paid a brief
visit to Fiji. He had then just published his first
half-crown burst of genius, and was trying to
escape from the consequences, but an influential
committee -with a pipe in its mouth called on him
and informed him that a few ardent admirers
were anxious to present him with an address and
testimonial, The kind offer was promptly ac-
oepted, and the author—decorated with a wildly
emblematic waistcoat, a large assortment o:
Abyssinian gold jewellery, high boots, and a whole
bottle of oil on his forelock, and looking altogether
like a Disraeli who had been put up the spout by
someone who had afterwards lost the ticket —
appeared in due course at the hotel. Herr
Weoker, a guttural sauer-krauter from the
Rhine, read the address, in which he “ gom-
plimented the author on the veeling, bathos, and
brovundity of his work,” and solemnly pre-
sented a little case to the man of gifts, bear's
grease, and jewellery, from which case presently
dropped two live rats. There was an awful
pause, during which any one could have heard a
whale drop, and the author turned the colour of
a newly-killed hog dipped in boiling water. Then
an individual of considerable savoir faire un-
corked a phial, a tall Yankee shrieked, “ Boys,
some one’s been eating something dead,” and the
committee fled for their lives, leaving the genius
gasping amid an odour that suggested 1000 dead
dogs being cremated in a chemical factory, with
eternal perdition, rum and onions, and a volley of
asafcetida thrown in. The author was afterwards
rescued more dead than alive, and most people
hoped he was cured, but his last novel shows that
he has got them very bad again.
Kimberley “gold-field” has been well
advertised, even in London, and as, at a late date,
a ship was on the berth advertised to sail “for
Kimberley direct,” Heaven only knows how many
poor unfortunates have by this time been packed
off by their relatives to “seek their fortune ” in
the arid wastes and howling wildernesses
of the poverty-stricken, God-forsaken Far West.
“It now appears,” says a London paper,
“that the whole merit of the recent dis-
covery of the gold-fields of Western Australia is
due to an Irishman —Mr. Edward Townley Hard-
man, a distinguished member of the staff of the
Geological Survey, Dublin, who was appointed by
the colonial Government to inspect and report
upon ‘ the geological features of the Kimberley
district ’in 1884. His report informed the world,
for the first time, of the existence of these gold-
fields, a statement which many received at first
with doubt; but its complete accuracy was
subsequently borne out by those who followed
in his footsteps, and now everybody concedes
to Mr. Hardman the honour of being the
pioneer of the road to that vast wealth which
his discovery holds forth to Western Australia.”
ƒ
It is a good job for this illustrious Dublin geologist
that the droves of once sturdy miners who, foot-
sore, centless and fever-stricken, are returning
from the bogus Kimberley goldfield, in no way
hold Mr. Edward Townley Hardman responsible
for the infamous lies promulgated in the Austra-
lian press in the interests of steamship-owners,
storekeepers, and station-holders. If the hundreds
of men who have been so basely deceived in this
matter had a fair chance of wreaking their col-
lective vengeance upon the necks of the persons
responsible for their misery, we don’t think that—
numerous as are the seekers after notoriety—
there are many individuals who would have the
hardihood to stand on the Australian mainland
and publicly take to themselves the entire and un-
divided credit of having started the Kimberley
rush.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The English Primrose League uses boy-
cotting as one of its principal we&pons.
Henry Ward Beecher says that “ all the
world over intellect is supporting democracy, and
as the masses are beginning to think, the rule of
aristocracy will not long survive.”
Vanity Fair’s remedy for the Tories
troubles is that “the Queen should appoint her
own Ministers. The system by which the House
nominates the Prime Minister and he nominates
his colleagues is a modern corruption ! ”
The electors of East Macquarie propose to
call on Mr. Shepherd, M.L.A., to explain “why
he let himself get licked” in the late N.S.W.
Parliamentary fight. Nobody seems to desire to
sit heavily on Mr. Lyne, but then the public
always howl with the dog that is uppermost.
Louis Napoleon had somewhat of the
prophet about him. This is what the Empress
Eugenie wrote in 1857. “ They are an imposing
race these Germans. Louis calls them the race ol
the future.” “Ditto” to Louis. The peaceful
Teuton invasion of Australia commenced last
week, when the pioneer ship of the new German
line landed 196 passengers at Melbourne and
Sydney.
The Victorian Conservative lawyers and Im-
perial Federationists unsuccessfully moved heaven
and earth to get that obscure straw-splitter, Mr.
Wrixon, appointed Chief Justice over the head ol
Judge Higinbotham. They are afraid that Judge
Higinbotham, if appointed Acting-Governor, might
by the “ peculiarity ” of his views, cause a rupture
between the colony and that Downing-street,
which he so much despises.
The Bullionist states that it is able to pul
its finger on syndicates that would bo “ happy to
purchase the entire Australian railway system at
the sum which it now represents in the national
debt.” It does not say, however, whether the
syndicates want to keep the wild-cat railways and
work them, or to float them into companies and
finance on them, and then pass the swindle on to
somebody else. The latter is much the more
likely of the two.
In China they have a compulsory cultiva-
tion law. In every village there is an Agricul-
tural Board consisting of old and experienced
men who sit in judgment on defaulters. Every
Chinese landowner or occupier who neglects to
cultivate his land according to the regulations is
punished with stripes—so many stripes for every
acre of land uncultivated. What nice little flog-
gings the Duke of Sutherland and other land
owners would be entitled to if they had only the
luck to be Chinamen J
1 (Premier Jennings’ proposal to give th
British Association free passages to Australia i
veritably a‘ ‘ centennial” idea. The people whosi

didn’t get return-tickets.
The cabled news of the rejectment o:
Parnell s motions condemning Irish winter evic
tions, recalls a story told of Lord Byron. When
the poet was in Parliament, a petition setting
forth, and calling for redress for the wretched
state of the Irish peasantry, was one evening pre-
sented to the House of Lo: o and very coldly re-
ceived. ‘ Ah,” said Lord/Lyron, “what a mis-
fortune it is for the Irish i/nat they wore not born
black! They would then have had plenty of
friends in both Houses.”
“ Bursting guns and crippled ships are just
now the order of the day in the British navy,”
says Vanity Fair. “On the other hand, the
extraordinary efforts made of late years to perfect
the French navy have been so successful that two
of the leading French Admirals declare it to bo in
the most perfect condition, and one of them says
If to-morrow wo had to undertake a naval war,
I should sail without the slightest anxiety at the
head of my squadron, and I should not doubt for
an instant of success, oven had wo to encounter
the fleet of the foreign power which is at present
regarded as the most formidable.’ ”
Revenue is getting short in Queensland, as
in many other places, and Dickson, M.P., who
carries the bag, calculates on filling the gap by a
tax on the dead. The widow loft with a large
family and £IOO cash, will, in future, have to pay
£5 to support Sir Sawmill Griffith in his wild anti-
Soparation career, and by the time she has buried
the lost husband and father and supplied mourning
for the orphans there will just be about 11s. 6d.
left. A widow, you see, has no vote, and an
orphan baby is only a cantankerous little cuss who
may never live to grow up and organise himself in
the cause of Federation and cheer for the great Ah
Sam, so that alligator-hide lawyer will go along as
usual.
In a recent and somewhat ferocious attack
upon the N.S.W. Minister for Lands, Mr. Abigail,
M.P., remarked, “He was evidently adopting
Shakespeare’s advice in Hamlet—' Get money—
honestly if you can—but get it.’ ” Mr. Abigail,
you are wrong. It was Hamlet who wrote the in-
junction quoted: it appears in his well-known
play “ Shakespeare” in that scene where Marc
Antony, a venomous little leather-seller, is offering
to give his kingdom for the horse which William
rode at the battle of the Boyne. This misconcep-
tion on the part of Mr. Abigail goes to prove that
no one man can pretend to a complete knowledge
of spelling, sole-leather, and Shakespeare at the
same time.
A West Australian paper declares that
“N.S.W. would be a great deal better without
responsible Government. ” Western Australia has
not got it, and except for the little drawbacks that
the colony is empty, and has no budget and no
money worth speaking of, and has no trade of any
moment, and no prospect of any, and no serious
debt because no one wants to lend her money—
but for these and a few other trifling items, she
has got on just as well as her neighbours. Re-
sponsible Government, however, does not look
very bright in N.S.W. at present, and perhaps a
good, healthy despotism, with a Sultan to run
things for a year or so, and a few Bulgarian atro-
cities to wipe out the present race of legislators
would be an advantage.
Mr. John Murray, the lazy member for
Warrnambool in the Victorian Assembly, is op-
posed to Parkes and the parsons on the New
Hebrides question. Speaking in Parliament, the
other day, he remarked that “ the cormorants of
the Presbyterian church had found «in those
islands splendid feeding-grounds. ” And further,
knowing the Presbyterian ministers as he did, ho
said that “ if he were a New Hebridean, and had
to choose between two evils—French soldiers or
Presbyterian missionaries—he should say, ‘ For
goodness sake, give me the French soldiers ; or,
even before the missionaries, give me the French
convicts.’ ” From all of which we conclude that
the meenister at Warrnambool has been canvass-
ing for John’s hated political rival.
Poor old Cross, the hack of the English
Tory Ministry, is becoming troublesome. A few
weeks ago it was cabled that he was to become a
peer under the title of Viscount Warrington, and
nobody seemed much excited at the news. Then
we heard that this was a mistake. He was only
to become Lord Cross, and the general opinion
was that he might have become Lord Hoss or
Lord Bosh if he pleased, but that in either case
the news was not worth paying for at Anglo-
Australian cable rates. Reuter’s telegraphic
Jeames gathers up these valuable items in London
and sends them to the S.M. Herald, and the
Herald’s Jeames passes the slush along. This
item is rather old now. We were waiting to see
if it would improve, like colonial wine, by keeping,
but it didn’t.
The N.S.W. University authorities seem
to have some faint sort of a wish to popularise the
study of Political Economy, as they have recently
appointed Mr. A. C. Wylie, Barrister-at-law to
deliver a course of lectures on this subject open
to all who put up the necessary fee. It is also
announced that the class will be held in the High
School instead of as formerly at the University
itself. It would be a blessing if some of the Mem-
bers could be induced to attend. They would
profit by some such instruction. Within the last
fortnight Mr. See, who is said to be a certain
Minister in the adjacent future, objected to the
Income Tax Bill because he preferred direct taxes
to taxes on incomes. But, for all that, we don’t
think any members will be attracted. If the
lectures were on the political sciences of contract-
faking, billet-grabbing, or commish-raking they
might be interested, but still very few would go
for several have learnt more than a whole Uni’
versify could ever teachin these profitable branches
of knowledge.
THE FUTURE
(A SONNET.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sprung from the strongest race on God’s green
earth,
That bound the broad sea with an iron band
And chained, with chains of linked steel, the
land —
Shall we, the sons of sires like these, make mirth
Of our great heritage and boasted birth,
Leaving the deeds of ancient days to stand
In scorn of us—like sphinxes in the sand
Of this our littleness and want of worth ?
Or shall we with a new free flag unfurl’d,
Build a broad Empire, strong to save or slay,
On the Arm pillars of this under-world,
Which calm and high shall hold its onward way
When older thrones down ruin’s rocks are hurled ?
I say not, but the coming years shall say.

Sir John Robertson closed his career last Saturday

At that Woollahra wedding, the girls said
the bride’s complexion was “rather yellow.” The

At last a man has had the courage to do it.
He was riding in a Darlinghurst ’bus, one fine day
last week, when a beauteous and extensively got-
up creature, who, allhough she does move in the
best Potts Point society, might easily have con-
descended to see that the vehicle was already full,
struggled in and was about to sit on somebody’s
knee. A masher —which his front name is Claude
—arose and gave her his seat. She flopped down
into it, wriggled her improver, settled into his
place, frowned like a thunderstorm, and said never
a word. “Madame!” said the masher, in tones
of the ancien regime, “ I have given you my seat,
not as a matter of right, hut as a matter of
courtesy, yet you do not thank me —you even
frown. lam sorry that I should have in any way
offended you ; I now have the honour to wish you
a very good morning.” Did she blush? No, in-
deed, the paint was too thick.
* * *
From a Sydney daily
“ From numerous copies of the Court Circular, which
have been sent to Sydney, we perceive that Mr. R. Burdett
Smith has been a distinguished guest at many fashionable
festivities, and has had many opportunities of dining with
dukes, duchesses, and other members of the nobility. Mr.
Smith appears to have left the political world to lesser
lights, and to have devoted himself to the higher circles of
society.”
Let us once and for all set Potts Point and Toorak
right in re this Court Circular business. There
are two Court Circulars— -one, the little official
handbill which records the names of the German
flunkeys and other “noble” loafers who have
.1 ust had the ineffable honour of licking the hoots
of Her Gracious Majesty, and which tells you, for
example that the Princess Frederica of Hanover
yesterday condescended to come out of her magni-
ficent pauperdom at Hampton Court Palace —only
things aren’t stated quite so “straight” as that —
and put her royal Teutonic hoof on the green
sward of Bushy Park for a quarter of an hour, the
Honorahles So-and-So and So-and-So being in attend-
ance. That Court Ci rcul.vr is, in short, Queen Vic-
toria’s especial organ, and is emphatically not the
one in which Mr. R. Burdett Smith, and Henniker
Heaton, and various Australian snobs, so often
and so prominently figure. The other so-called
Court Circular is a weekly “society” news-
paper run by one Savile Clarke, who has made a
fortune out of a smart idea. Having found that
the name of the sacred Royal handbill above-
mentioned was not copyright, Mr. Clarke calmly
appropriated its name and started another Court
Circular, to the intense disgust of Her Gracious,
&c., who was, however, powerless to interfere.
Had he in former times “ prigged ” anything from
Royalty, his head would have decorated a spike
over the Tower gate ; but as matters stand, Mr.
Savile Clarke lives in clover by ministering to the
vanity of the vast army of colonial and other
toadies. Long may he wave!
* * *
The marriage of Captain Terry, A.D.C. to
Governor Carington, with pretty Miss Laura
Throckmorton, has convulsed Sydney society to
its foundations —wherever they may he. Broadly
speaking, the wedding is the only one of import-
ance which has taken place in N.S.W. for about
half a century. The bride’s dress from Paris and
the bridegroom’s get-up from London have been
fully discussed, and so they should have been, for
the affair was of such general interest throughout
the colonies that it was at one time suggested that
it should bo deferred until the “ Centenary.” The
history of the gallant bridegroom is of transcen-
dent interest. We have read no less than 17
columns bearing, on the subject in the daily press
within the last week, and gather that he first saw
1 ght in the year 1863, and was about seven years
old at the time of the battle of Sedan, at which he
was not present. When he was yet in his thir-
teenth year the siege of Plevna took place, hut
owing to scholastic engagements, he was unavoid-
ably absent from the gory scene. But it was not
likely that one born in such stirring times would
long remain merely an idle spectator of unnum-
bered bloody pageants, so in, we are informed,
1883 he joined the Buckinghamshire militia —
whereupon the three Emperors immediately met
at Gastein and formed an alliance against Eng-
land. In time the skill with which the gallant
officer conducted himself at “ small and ear lies ”
attracted the eagle eye of Lord Carington—an eye
ever on the watch for evidences of military genius.
Captain Terry thus became A.D.C. toH.E. (itsounds
like Euclid). Leaving England a simple lieutenant,
he so distinguished himself during the brief voyage
of the Carthage that on his arrival he was pro-
moted to the rank of captain, and had the trip
continued another month he might possibly have
risen to the rank of a Field-Marshal. Well, any-
how, the good-looking and wealthy Captain Terry
got married at All Saints’, Woollahra, on Tuesday
of last week to Miss Laura Throckmorton, who,
we are particularly told, is the niece of Sir
Nicholas W. G. Throckmorton, and step-daughter
of Mr. Edward Wrench, of Caradon. The cere-
mony was performed by Primate Barry, the Rev.
G. Noith-Ash, and the Rev. W. H. Mort, so that
the “ knot” was made rather complicated. Before
business began the Primate abjured the congrega-
tion not to laugh! The request was an odd one
and probably had some hidden irony in it. How-
ever, no one did laugh. The bride arrived
t venty minutes late, and so kept H.E. and Lady
Carington and all the “swagger” company wait-
i ig. The bridegroom gnawed his moustache with
vexation, but when the lady did come he left off.
The bride was attired in splendid silver brocade,
made with a moderately long tail edged with
delicate lace ruffling. Her veil was of plain
white tulle, falling a little below her waist, and
fastened by a diamond crescent and star. She
o irried a lovely bouquet, and was perfectly self-
p assessed throughout the ceremony, as was also
the gay bridegroom. There were four brides-
maids, three being sisters of the bride, and the
fourth Miss Mabel Laidley. They were all beauti-
fully clad and looked lovely. The service was
choral. The church decorations had been carried
out by Searl and Co., of the Markets, and though
not extensive, were very beautiful; curiously
enough the font had received special attention.
Besides H.E. and Lady Carington, there were pre-
sent Admiral Tryon and his flag-lieutenant, Mr.
Pakenham; the Primate and Mrs. Barry, Mrs. J.
A. Joseph, Colonel and Mrs. Airey, Miss Hogg,
Hon. J. B. Watt, Mrs. Henry Mort, Mr. and Mrs.
Gilles, Mr. and Mrs. Bertie Lord, and Lord Bertie,
Captain Gascoigne, Mr. Wallington, Mr. Field,
Mr. Blacket, Judge and Mrs. Forbes, Mrs. G.
North-Ash, and Dr. and Mrs. Nott. Upwards of
100 guests attended the breakfast-table, and in the
evening a small dance concluded the entertain- I
ment. Captain and Mrs. Terry left by special
train for Sutton Forest at 5.20 p.m. in order to
spend a few days at the country residence of Lord
Carington. They proceed to Melbourne to he the
guests of Sir Henry Loch on the 21st inst., thence
to Tasmania, and will leave for England in time
for the London season.

Some peculiar proceedings processed at
All Saints’, Woollahra (Sydney), on Miss Throck-
morton’s wedding day. A lady took it into her
head to stand up on the font so as to get a better
view of the proceedings, and this action being in
direct opposition to all rules and regulations, the
female attendant went to this perching dame and
requested her to “ get off.” The “ lady” refused.
Female attendant sought the verger, who came
over to the contumacious lady and argued the
case at some length, but to no purpose. At last
the verger, driven to desperation, called in a
genial mimher av th’ foorce, who tried persuasion
with the same success as the others. At last he
took her by the arm to forcibly remove her, but
the champion told him in a strong voice that he
was “exceeding his duty” and that she would
stay there as long as she liked. These remarks
doubled up Robert, for he let go of her arm in
double quick time, and the lady occupied her con-
spicuous and hardly-held point d’avantage until
she chose to resign it. Let’s see :we have called
her a lady, haven’t we 2

Waverley is going to have a flower Show. But we fancy it
will be a failure, as it is to be run in the interest of a local
park and not in those of the local curate.
A dance was given at Needs’ rooms on Monday evening, 6th
inst., by Mr. and Mrs. Alick Osborne to celebrate their silver
wedding. Most of the guests were relations.
A couple of gallant officers in one branch of the N.S.W.

A certain startling English novelty has quite a practical
turn about it: a lady has only to buy an Insurance Corset,
and get killed while wearing it, within twelve months from
the date of purchase, and the sum of £lOO will be paid her
representatives.
May or V oung has opened his gardens at Annandale to the
public until the end of next month. He is said to have a fine
collection of exotics, and we understand he is shortly ex-
pected to exhibit his new title, lately planted, but to bear
fruit early in October.
A sailors’ free concert was held on Wednesday the Bth inst.
at the Sydney Bethel Union concert-room. The sailors and
their friends rolled up largely. The members of the bailor s
Band performed during the evening, and the tars thoroughly
enjoyed themselves.
In his recent bankruptcy examination in London, Lord
Headley said that since a certain date he had not pawned
anything, for the sufficient reason that he had nothing to
pawn. This recalls the statement of another Irish Peer, the
late Lord Glengall, under similar circumstances—viz., that
his property consisted of “a glass ink-bottle and his wearing
apparel.
a society point of view there is nothing to tell re
garding the Hawkesbury races. Fashion and dre?s—there is
a difference—do not go there; and this is not altogether to
be wondered at considering the distance and the slowness at
which our trains travel.
Visitors mustered strongly at Mayor Young's quarterly
luncheon on 9th inst. “ Not only,” says a daily, “ were
aldermen present, but even members of Parliament put in an
appearance.” These pressmen are young or ironical. Mr.
Dibbs, as usual, gave a long speech.
The lady who does the fashion-writing in the Sydney
Globe calmly and artlessly tells her fair readers to “ take a
bath every day. If persevered in, you will see the benefit
that accrues from it.” And so say all of us ! But are baths
a novelty in Sydney fashionable circles?
It is alleged that Prince Henry of Battenberg—who now
occupies John Brown’s place in the Queen’s affections —has
been so cruelly snubbed by his Royal relations and by British
swelldom generally that he is absolutely afraid to venture
forth without the protecting wing of his mother-in-law.
The poor patients of Gladesville Hospital were last week given
an excellent concert, got up largely through the im trument ility
of Mrs. C. E. Moulton, of Ryde. Many persons contributed
music both vocal and instrumental, amongst whom were
noticed Mrs. King, Miss Brabazon, Mr. Wilkinson, and Mr.
Steane.
Lord Oastlerosse, lately of Melbourne, who is to marry the
daughter of “Lord" Revelstoke—his name was Baring and
he was “ ennobled ”by his dross—is delicately alluded to by
a contemporary as “the charming, convivial A.D.C. who
danced upon the table on the occasion of the festivity he paid
for at the Grand Hotel.”
Alderman Kither, of Adelaide, is, in England, a stupend-
ous philanthropist. And he is right. If he were to feed the
hungry of his native city or take to visiting the large crowd of
saints now in gaol at Adelaide, who would ever hear of it ?
As the poet beautifully says, “ He does good by wealth —and
sends a wire to make it fame.”
The Carington Skating Rink, Sydney, is attracting a great
deal of attention. On the 9th inst. it was largely attended on
the occasion of a “Carnival on Skates,” followed by a plain
and fancy dress ball. The dresses were in some cases very
handsome; in others very much the other way. The music
was by the Balmain Alliance Band.
We read that at the Prince of Wales’ brilliant ball at
Marlborough House at the end of July “the colonials were
in full force, and did not seem one bit overawed by the
presence of diplomatists from every country in Europe.” The
more the colonists see of the great people of Europe, the less
reason they see to be frightened of them*
Mr. Firth, 0.E., of Sydney, is announced to have fixed his
affections at Double Bay. Mr. A. J. Been, of Miller’s Creek
station, is also reported to have received satisfactory assur-
ances from Miss M. Woodd, daughter of the Rev. G. Woodd,
Watson’s Bay. From Melbourne comes the news that the
daughter of a Major-General resident there is affianced to a
wealthy West Australian squatter.
A bazaar in aid of St. Andrew’s Church, Summerhill, was
opened in the church schoolroom on the 7th inst. The ladies
who got the affair up were members of what is known as the
—ahem!—“Parsonage Workbasket!” The stalls, &c., were
very tastefully decorated, and the fascinating Workbasketors
succeeded in extracting fortunes from the pockets of those
who felt it a pleasure to attend. We were not there.
The bachelors of Merriwa (N.S.W, gave a successful plain
and fancy dress ball at the local School of Arts, on the 3'd
inst. Over one hundred guests were oresent. Of the ladies
Mrs. W. Hall as “ Juliet Miss Howard as “Mary, Queen
of Scots;" Mrs. P. J. Egan as “Norwegian Peasant,” and
Miss M. Lawless as “ Cards,” looked as nice as they make
’em. The gentlemen, as a rule, wore evening suits, but one
or two were in fancy dress.
At Greymouth (N.Z.) a bride is missing. She waited till
the only man she ever loved had got everything ready for the
wedding, and then she seized the wedding-cake and fled. The
bridegroom turned up at the altar, but as for the fair charmer
who had reposed her horse-hair chignon so often on his con-
fiding shoulder she was in the shadowy land of nowhere. She
may be on the railway, she may be on the sea, but where’er
she be the bridegroom is still cussing round in search of she.
This is not poetry, but it is very near it.
Vanity Fair says Mrs. Crawford (Dilke’s friend) is comely
but not pretty—her cheek bones are too high. She is fresh,
blooming, blue-eyed, and full-figured, and might very well
sit for the milkmaid in the ballad, or for the Bailiff’s daugh-
ter of Islington. She has a pleasant voice, low but clear, and
an artless, innocent manner. At the trial, her pale, olive-
green, tight-fitting dress was cut to perfection, but her tower-
ing, reddish-brown straw hat was a failure. In giving her
answers she was nervous but self-contained, and said one or
two smart things.
A given to the officers of the German ships
in port at the German Club, Sydney, on Wednesday, the Bth
inst., by the members of the club. Amongst those present
were Mr. T. Grenier, A. Von Rompaey (agent for the German
Empire), D- Leibius, Captain Thalenhorst (of the Salier), the
Hon J L me, Mr. Carl Fischer, and, need we add, the
Righ Ho I W. B. Dailey, P.C. The toasts were many, Cap-
tain Von Baudissin responding for the Marine. He spoke
much of the iron and blood that had welded together the
German Empire—which brought the Right Honourable to his
eet. War was his usual theme, and in blood he revelled.
But on this occasion he spoke of peace, never once being able
to bring in the Soudan fizzle even by a side-wind. Our only
P.C, was evidently cramped, but he concluded with some
words that lead us to suppose he will shortly enter the Ger-
man army. The evening was of course delightful, and every
one left fully satisfied with the share he had had of it.
The Sydney Liedertafel smoke concert came off on 10th
inst., the room being well filled. H.B. and Lord Bertie
arrived about 8 o’clock, and sipped their whisky-and-water
like ordinary mortals. The programme was a very complete
one, the chief singers being Messrs. P. P. Jones, Morgan, and
M'Ninn, with the members acting as chorus. Mr. Jones
sang very finely “The King’s Champion,” and received an
encore. Mr 'J. Delaney acted as conductor, and Mr. 0.
Huenerbein. as accompanist. The whole affair was very
successful
“ Babies are becoming fashionable,” is the astonishing an-
nouncement of a contemporary. Lady Oarington, it seems,
takes her darlings with her on aJI possible occasions, and as
a result, fashionable ladies who have hitherto done little
exaept act as stepmother to an obese and evil-nosed pug
have now dethroned the burly-snouted canine and take out
their children instead. An attractive baby, it now seems, is,
after all, almost as good company as a wheezy dog, and the
rising generation accordingly are having a benefit for which
they owe Lady Oarington many thanks
Another lunatic has turned up at Windsor. His name was
Junior, and he had come down to marry the Queen. A goad
many lunatics have done the same, but very few sane men
have made the attempt. Junior amused himself for some
time by writing letters to his “Beloved Victoria” and signing
them “ Vour husband the Emperor,” but getting no reply he
waltzed down to the palace to settle matters in person. He
was accompanied by a large clasp-knife, which he said he
used for cutting his corns, and presumably he brought it on
this occasion on the chance that Her Majesty might also
want to trim some old and reliable barometer on her toe.
Mr. Junior is now cutting his corns in a lunatic asylum.
The Czar of bankrupt Russia has had a bad experience.
He was leaving the Imperial photographer’s rooms when he
met on the stairs a towering, military-looking female, and
received a salute which made his aristocratic jaw drop in
terror. Fully believing that the lady was a Nihilist with an
explosive improver, he was about to yell for help when he
recognised in her a young officer of the Imperial Guard, who
was evidently travelling incog. Not knowing how to make a
curtsey, the unhappy Turk-slaughterer had given himself
away, and the indignant Czar ordered him to go and report
himself to his colonel, bonnet, “bustle,” and all, just as he
was. The dismissed sub. obeyed, and his superior grew blue
and apoplectic with rage as he listened, till the misguided
man with the bustle was forced to grab him in his arms to
prevent him from falling. It was just at this crisis that the
colonel’s wife came in and made a remark, and also tore out
all her supposed rival’s hair. She next reduced his apparel
to rags, and kicked him two or three times, and was about to
throw him out when he got his second wind and explained
the position. This is what is termed a joke in Russia.
On Wednesday, the Bth inst., Miss Pattie Lewis, sister of
Mrs. W. H. Traill, was married to Mr, James Fother-
inghame, late third officer of the Ly-ee-Moon. The
ceremony took place at Mr. Traill’s residence, the Grove;
Newtown, and was performed by the Rev. Andrew Gardiner
in the drawing-room, which had been beautifully decorated for
the occasion. A large number of guests were present. The
bride looked charming in a handsome dress of white satin
richly trimmed with lace and the usual orange blossoms.
She was attended by two prettily-dressed nieces and several
young nephews also charmingly attired. When the service
was over Miss Traill played the “ Wedding March ve/y
finely. The guests remained for the evening, and danced
energetically until the small hours. The presents were very
costly and of useful character. The bridegroom s present
was the Humane Society’s medal, won by him under such
memorable circumstances, made into a brooch. Amongthe
guests were Mr. Griffin (American Consul), Mr. and Mrs.
G Maiden, Mr. and Mrs. Somer, Mrs. Gullett, Mr add Mrs.
Maitland, Mr. and Mrs. Dan. O’Connor, Mr. and Mrs. Jflat-
tau, Mr. and Mrs. Well, Mr. and Mrs. F. W. Ward.
Admiral Tryou and the officer! and men of H.M. held
the naval sports on Sydney Association Grounds on r nday,
10th inst. The day was splendid. There were about 000
invited guests, and as cards had to be shown at the gate, the
usual 000 ‘ ‘ dead-heads ” had to return to their dens in disgust.
The sports wore conducted in a style from which landsmen
should take a lesson. There was no delay—one event nnisnea,
the bugle-call announced another, and so on to the end of
the programme. Lord Oarington rode to the grounds accom-
panied by his suite and some young gentlemen who are now
guests at Government House. A gallant captain was attired in
a coat made apparently for a man 12ft. high and a fathom
and a half across the shoulders, riding-pants 4ft. across tne
upper portion and shrunk in to fit a pipe-stem at the Knees
leather boots to match, and billy-cock hat on one side of the
head. He attracted much attention, and was greatly ad-
mired. The Hon. Something wore a tight-flttmg ndingmoat
of blue and sandy checks, each check fully Ift- squat ,
pants to match, wonderful riding-boots, and spurs th
would have knocked life into the Soudan jackiw. in*
nobleman’s attire was the most wonderful ever seen o . y
ground. He had come to show the poor Australian now an
English gentleman has to dress, and he has convinced
everybody. He was all day the centre of an admiring
throng. The Hon Baring drew immensely.

VARNISH AND VARNISH.
Few people probably outside the trades or pro-
fessions who use varnish in connection with their
business know much about its qualities, consti-
tuents, varieties, or general value. Yet it is
perhaps, the most valuable finisher that civilized
man is acquainted with —the art-preservative of
arts, it might be called. The beautifully var-
nished surfaces of the wood-work with which we
come in contact in everyday life, the furniture in
our houses and the carriages in the streets reflect
from their brilliant exteriors, as from a mirror,
the form and fashion of surrounding objects ; with
this result everyone is familiar, but with the
labor, care, and infinite skill required in the pro-
duction and application of these varnishes few
except the initiated are acquainted. The pigment
seems as deep as the sea ; but there is only a thin
film of it, and it is to the attainment of this end
that makers of the varnish have, with varying
success, devoted so much time, money and energy,
Three different kinds of varnish are manu-
factured, which may be classified thus: — -pint
varnish, in which alcohol is used as a solvent;
volatile-oil varnish, where the solvent is turpen-
tine ; and the fixed-oil varnishes, where the resin
must be melted and then combined with turpentine
and linseed oil. The resin commonly used in the spirit
varnishes is shellac, the product of the banyan tree
of India. The volatile-oil varnishes are generally
composed of a solution of soft resins in turpentine,
and are inferior in quality to the others ; but the
base of the fixed-oil varnishes is copal or fossil
resins, found in many parts of the world ; hut
principally on the eastern sea coast of equatorial
Africa.
One of the main difficulties in the production of
varnish appears to he not so much to make it good,
but to make it uniformly good. Many small
makers make a hit sometimes, and turn out as
good a sample as the larger ones ; but it is im-
possible to insure uniformity of production, except
the business is conducted on a large scale, with
plenty of capital, plenty of room, and a sound
system; because where the gums and oils are
only bought in small quantities, though the
maker’s formula may be all right, he runs the risk
of getting a good lot of material one time and a bad
lot the next, and the uncertainty of varnish is one
of its worst and most common faults. All con-
sumers know this, and realise, while they mourn,
the difficulty of purchasing an article which can
be depended on for absolute uniformity at all
times and under all conditions.
One of the largest and best known manufac-
tories of varnish in the United States of America
claims that, “ When we sell a can of varnish, we
know just exactly what we are delivering ; for we
have not only formulas and rules, but we have
laboratory tests ; and then, to cap all, practical
tests of every tank by an expert painter, whose
duty it is not to compliment our goods, but to
criticise them.”
The varnishes of the Murphy Company are dis-
tinguished for their Paleness, their Fine Working
Properties, their Lustre, their Durability, and,
above all others, their Uniformity. The enormous
storage capacity of the Murphy Varnish Com-
pany’s works at Newark and Cleveland, in addition
to the stocks kept at Chicago and St. Louis for
convenience of shipment, insures the necessary
age, without which the finest properties of varnish
cannot be developed, and carries with it an as-
surance of uniformity which no other statement
could give. In addition to this, the factory system
of the company, which looks after the smallest
detail with the utmost completeness, is supple-
mented by careful and repeated practical tests by
the most eminent varnishers in America, and no
tank is allowed to be tapped for shipment until it
fully reaches the standard adopted for it in every
particular. Varnishes for finishing, for under
coats, and for miscellaneous work, are alike sub-
jected to these tests, and they are now introduced
to the public as the successful result of twenty
years of continuous labor, costly appliances, and
scientific research. The demand for them through-
out the States is enormous; once used they are
never neglected in favor of any other brand, and
there is no case on record in which they have
failed to give the greatest satisfaction and elicit
the highest testimony to their worth.
Messrs. Albert Gregory and Co., the well known
and extensive wholesale coach and saddlers’ iron-
mongers, of 40, Market-street, Sydney, have been
appointed the sole agents for New South Wales
for the Murphy Company’s Varnishes, and it is
believed that this will be a well-appreciated
addition to their already extensive and well as-
sorted stock of all requisites connected with the
business with which they are so favorably indent!-
fled in this city.
A visit to the extensive premises of Messrs.
Albert Gregory and Co., in Market-street, reveals
a stock of Coach and Saddlers’ Ironmongery which
apparently comprises every item known to, or
likely to be required in any branch of either trade.
The four floors of the warehouse are packed with
materials, some of which are familiar at a first
glance, and others only to he recognised by those
conversant with the trade. There are to be
seen :
Axles and Springs of English and American
make for every description of vehicle, from a light
buggy to a heavy dray.- Malleable Castings of all
sorts. Wheelstuff for Sulky, Buggy, Coach, Cart,
&c. ; nothing being kept but the very best second
growth of timber. Hickory Poles, Shafts, Circles,
Bars, and Lazybacks. All sizes of Hickory and
Ash planks. Bolts and Nuts, both English and
American make; Carriage, Tire, T Shackle, &c.
On the next floor we find Leather of all descrip-
tions and varieties used in the business. There is
Colored, Trimming, Enamelled, Top, Dash, Seal-
skins, Japanned, Basils, Colored Roans, Morocco,
and Middlings. Carriage Cloth, Lace, Tufts, But-
tons, See. English and American Duck, Muslin
Oil Carpet, Tufting, and Seaming Twine, and all
matters that go to make up the necessaries for
the coach-finishers’ work.
In another part of the bulking every kind of
English and American harness is kept, with collars
of all sorts and sizes, buckles, webs, Checks,
kerseys, English and Colonial heads and reins,
breastplates, stirrup leathers, and irons, cruppers,
girths, hames, back, plough, and trace chains, &c.
In the paintroom is a large stock of dry and
ground coach colors, in small packages and large
tins, axle grease, softsoap, vaseline, oils, turis,
white lead and varnishes, including
, the FAMOUS murphy varnishks,
which are now so largely in demand in the work-
shops of Europe and America.
As a ready method of attracting the attention
of the general public to the value of these var-
nishes, and thereby simplifying the process of
their introduction, it has been decided to present
A WATERBURY WATCH
to every purchaser of a trial sample of not less
than one gallon each of Murphy’s “ Palest Dur-
able Carriage ” and “Pale Durable Body” until
further notice.
All inquiries concerning the Murphy Company’s
Varnishes will be cheerfully answered, and every
information given on application to Messrs, Albert
Gregory and Co., the sole agents for New South
Wales,

“RAIDING THE GAMBLING DENS.”
POLICEMAN X.: “IT’S A RAID ON YER GAMBLING DEN THAT IS TO BE MADE.
JOHN, WHIN WOULD YER LIKE IT NOW.”
JOHN: “YOU COMB MONDAY, ALL LI; YOU COME TUESDAY, ALL LI.”
POLICEMAN X.: “OH WE’LL JUST MAKE IT TUESDAY, THIN.”

“The Chinese dens were raided last night, but no gambling was going on at the time of the
officers’ visit.” —Daily Paper.
Mr. Shepherd Smith, identified with the
Bank of New South Wales for the last 33 years,
and for some time past its general manager, died
on Monday afternoon last at the age of 51 years.
His funeral on Wednesday was very largely at-
tended. By an error in making up, a paragraph
reporting his previous convalescence appears in a
few copies of this issue.
The New Hebrides hysteria is rapidly
abating in Victoria. Even the Rev. Mr. Paton,
who has raved so long and so unsuccessfully on
the subject, is at last getting discouraged. He
convened a monster meeting for the other night at
a Melbourne church, with himself in the chair,
and four missionaries (including a Chinaman) as
supports. This galaxy of talent attracted a rush
of seven men and 28 women and children. They
constituted the “Australian people” on whose
behalf Graham Berry is making a fool of himself
by threatening France from the other side of the
Channel.
The great Chinese festival of ‘ ‘ hunting
the devil” has just come off at Ballarat (Vic.) A
huge bonfire was lighted at the rear of the Joss-
house, and a feast was prepared in an adjoining
shed, a pie made of Thomas pussy occupying a
prominent position on the bill of Mongol fare. A
priest chanted some celestial poetry calculated to
scrape the hair off a wombat, after which 100
yellow men banged tom-toms, and other festive
instruments, and every now and then an adjourn-
ment was made in-doors, where, prior to a fowl
and pie orgie, and a big opium-smoke, the com-
pany bowed solemnly to a horse-hide image, sup-
posed to be a deity.
The Revel. J. Poole, a visitor from Cal-
cutta, where he conducts a large missionary busi-
ness, says, “some of us have wondered how it is
that Australia has no missions in India.” We
can throw a little light upon that subject. Her
Gracious Majesty’s Indian subjects are not profit-
able converts. They have little in the way of
merchandise to swap for the blessed truth. Why
should our missionaries go to India and work for
nothing, when they may, perhaps, pick up a nice
Pacific island, for a couple of bibles and a double-
barrelled gun ? Not that we do not occasionally do
something for the heathen on the other side of the
line. Didn’t we send a Contingent to the Soudan ?
When the much-paragraphed Mr. Quong
Tart and his bride were honeymooning at Ballarat,
a gorgeous little chavoo was got up in honour of
their visit. Singing and champagne, music and
blanc-mange, congratulations and cold chicken,
were plentifully provided, but the tenderest chord
of emotional sympathy was touched when a poem
composed by “ a young lady admirer of Mr. Tart”
(and there are millions such) was read by Master
Little. The lines are apostrophic, and the last verse
wails along in this fashion :
“ And as we welcome thee this day,
With loving and with open heart;
So will we speed thee on thy way—
Long live Quong Tart!”
The poem as a whole is appropriate to the occa-
sion. “Heart” only rhymes to “Tart” twice, a
very moderate number of times considering the
very obvious connection that has always existed
between the two. Mr. Tart may well be proud of
these verses, but it won’t do for other “lady ad-
mirers” to pay similar tributes in future, for the
great heart of feminine Australia must realise the
fact that the gallant little man is now securely
i and irrevocably married.
Mr. John Shepherd— the N.S.W. legisla-
tor, not the burglar—doubts whether there ever
was a Parliament more degraded than the pre-
sent. Mr. Shepherd is a member of it, and if he
doesn’t know, who does ?
Sufferers from Rheumatism, Lumbago, Scia-
tica and other analogous affections should try
Freeman’s Original Ghlorodyne, a medicine that
has, since its introduction in 1841, been tried on a
very large scale both by the Medical Profession and
the Public in every part of the habitable Globe,
with unvaried success. Since its introduction
into New South Wales the popularity of Freeman’s
Ghlorodyne has been considerably enhanced, and
is now regarded as the most efficient and valuable
medicine that has ever been introduced into the
Colony. The Profession prescribe it; Missionaries
prefer and use Freeman’s Ghlorodyne, and people
leaving Sydney for the interior invariably take a
sufficient supply to last them a twelvemonth.
Insist upon having “Freeman’s” only. Trade
mark an Elephant.—Obtainable from all chemists
and storekeepers.

Carnrick’s Soluble Food for Infanta, Invalids,
and Aged Persons, is the most nutritious, palatable, and easily-digested Infant’s
Foodever manufactured,containing fiftyper cent, ofthesolids of milk (digested)
and fifty per cent, of the finest wheat, converted into soluble form.
A most perfect food. The nearest approach to Mother’s Milk ever made.
It is unequalled for the formation of fat, flesh, and bone, and increasing
the vital forces SO necessary to health.
Specially recommended in cases of Marasmus, Diarrhoea, and Cholera
Infantum, and where the digestion is defective.
Children fed upon cereals or cow’s milk alone very often remain weak, and
suffer from softening of the bones, and when attacked by infantile dis-
orders are unable to resist the inroads of disease.
“CARNRICK’S SOLUBLE FOOD” is invaluable for Invalids
and Aged Persons (who cannot digest farinaceous food), as it is rich
in nutritive and easily-digested albumenoids, thus increasing both flesh
and strength, and restoring the vital forces.
It is most convenient fo" use,being in a powdered form, and will keep indefinitely.
When boiled and stirred for three minutes it is ready for immediate use.

Carnrick’s Cod Liver OMMilk
PEPTONISED (DIGESTED.)
Highly recommended by the Medical Profession throughout the world as being
the best remedy for Coughs, Colds, Bronchitis, Scrofula, Wasting
Diseases, Consumption, General Debility, over-taxed brains, &c., &c.
It will produce an immediate gain in flesh and strength.
Can be taken when all other forms of Cod Liver Oil are refused.
It contains about equal parts of the best Norwegian Cod Liver Oil and concen-
trated fresh milk, both peptouised (digested).
The peptonised milk disguises the unpleasant taste and smell of the oil, and
makes it as sweet as cream; very palatable and most nourishing.
Invaluable for children, and will agree with the most delicate persons, causing
no return or unpleasantness.
One trial Will satisfy anyone of the great value of this new and unique pre-
paration.
The reconstructive or nutritive properties are five times greater than the
plain oil or any Other Emulsion, hence it is much cheaper.
Both the Oil and the Milk being digested, the whole will assimilate, whereas
in Cod Liver Oil and other Emulsions (being undigested) only a small
proportion is of any value. It is the most nerfect Emulsion ever
made, and the only one of digested Cod Liver Oil and Milk.
Analysed and recommended by the first Professors in Europe.
We also manufacture the above preparation combined with Hypophosphitea
of Lime and Soda. SOLD BY ALL CHEMISTS.

thank you, I never eat cream in the winter,” she sweetly re-
plied. “Well, do try a dish of those delicious Oysters, won't
you, pet,” he continued. “No, Alfred, they are so dear,”
“I thought I was the only thing that was dear.” “Oh,
Alfred, I must go home.” “lam so sorry,” he said. “ Oh,
pet, I know what you want. Bet me order a bottle of that

That practising physicians of all schools, not only endorse a
proprietary medicine, but prescribe it in their practice, yet
this is done every day in the case of Dr. Bell’s (Kidney

“ DEMOCRAT’S ” CREDENTIALS.
Extract from Sydney Sunday News ;—
“ In our advertising columns will be found the
public notices of ‘ Democrat’s ’ Consultations on
the Caulfield and Melbourne Cups for 1886, which
promise to be most popular undertakings on the
part of the spirited and enterprising promoter of
those wonderful ‘ fortune-making ’ lotteries. It is
not often that we have a good word to say of racing
consultations as a rule, but in ‘ Democrat’s ’ case
we can strongly recommend them to the public, as
we happen to know the moving spirit—one of the
right sort, and who is proverbial in racing circles
for honest and square dealing. One of the best
features of ‘ Democrat’s ’ consultations is the fact
of the drawing being conducted by a committee
of influential gentlemen, whose names are above
suspicion.”
Several other newspapers have borne similar
testimony to the genuineness of “ Democrat’s ”
consultations.

Here you have a poor dog pursued by a billy and a Sydney Bobby. The Bobby is
the worst, for he will soon catch the dog and the billy both. He does not want the
billy, because it is an old one, and leaks, but he can sell the dog to the boiling-down
people for half-a-crown.
