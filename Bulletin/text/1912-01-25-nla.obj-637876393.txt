A World of Men
Weininger was but one of the many men
who have written about women—as females.
Here is the man —as male—put under the
microscope by a woman. And The Mari-
Made World, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman
(Unwin, per Lockley Library), is well worth
perusal by the insect under the microscope
as well as by the female of our species.
Charlotte puts on a scientific basis more than
Corelli has been stammering for years.
The author accepts, and has reason to
accept, the Gynsecocentric theory of the
development of the human race. This theory
may be defined thus: The female is the race
type, and the male, originally but a sex type,
reached, in the human family, a later equal-
ity with the female, and became her master
for a considerable historic period—and, it
may be added, still remains her master. The
human species has been, since historic times,
under androcentric rule—a domination by
the male. But biologists have tentatively
accepted the theory that at some remote
period the human species was a woman-ruled
world, the male being merely an accident,
till his sex attributes enabled him to snatch
the dominion from the female, engrossed in
her racial attributes, and to keep it ever since.
Thus the species has developed under a
masculine tyranny, and the masculine attri-
butes, lightly summed up by Charlotte as
“to butt—to strut —to make a noise—all for
love’s sake”I—have 1 —have become, in the view of
the ruling sex, human, arm not merely mas-
culine, attributes.
That stupendous and successful rebellion,
lost in the mists of the race’s remote past,
was the most pregnant event in the world.
The tremendous war waged by one sex, the
despised male, against the haughty female,
through millions and millions of years lias
unfortunately no chroniclers. Yet we may
picture it vaguety. Here was the human
race ruled by the female, with the man a
mere sex accessory, despised as are the
drones in the hive, yet handy to have about
the cave. The prospective husbands decorated
themselves, preened themselves and fought
each other in the meek hope that their
tyrant' queens would graciously deign to
select the victors for their consorts. Their
sole use was as fathers. They were set apart,
out of the human race, as a sex. And gradu-
ally they grew uneasy at their servitude, and
at length revolted. The long vicissitudes of
that tremendous warfare we know not; but
at the end the male had deposed the female,
flung her into a sex servitude, and has kept
her manacled ever since. The result is that:
We have been so largely taxen up with the
phenomena of masculinity and feminity that
our common humanity has largely escaped
notice. We know we are human but we do
not know in what our humanness consists,
nor how men and women may fall short of it,
or overstep its bounds... Since the range of
feeling and action proper to humanity, as
such, is far wider than that proper to' either
sex, it seems at first somewhat remarkable
that we have given it so little recognition...
We have taken it for granted, since the dawn
of civilisation, that mankind meant men-
kind, and that the world was theirs. Women
we have sharply delimited. Women were a
sex—“the sex” ; they were set apart for spe-
cial services peculiar to feminity. As one
English scientist put it, in 1888, “Women are
not only the race—they are not even half the
race, but a sub-species told off for reproduc-
tion only.”
This is a book about men —as such. It
differentiates between the human nature and
the sex nature. It will not go so far as to
allege man’s masculine traits to be all that
excuse or explain his existence; but it will
point out what are masculine traits as dis-
tinct from human ones, and what has been
the effect on our human life of the unbridled
dominance of one sex...lt seeks to show
that what we have all this time called
“human nature,” and deprecated, was in
great part only male nature, and good enough
in its place; that what we have called
“masculine,” and admired as such, was in
large part human, and should be applied to
both sexes; that what we have called “fem-
inine,” and condemned, was also largely
human and applicable to both. Our andro-
centric culture is shown to have been, and
still to be, a masculine culture in excess, and
therefore undesirable.
The mistake has been made by practically
all men —simply because they were men. To
the man, the whole world was his world, his
because he was male ; and the Whole world
of women was the home, because she was
female. He had everything else-, and. having
it, naturally he called it male. The author
insists on a “man’s sphere” as sharply de-
fined and even more limited than a “woman's
sphere.”
Woman’s natural work as a female is that
of the mother; man’s natural work as a male
is that of the father; but human work covers
all life outside these specialities. Every
handicraft, every profession, every science,
every art, all normal amusements and recrea-
tions, all government, education, religion, the
whole living world of human achievement—-
all this is human. /
So there!
In the animal kingdom—as it was in the
human race under gynsecocentric culture —
sex selection is always at work. The males
compete for the female, and she selects the
victor, thus securing to the race the best
father. In forming the proprietary family
as in the human race under androcracy, there
is no such competition, no such selection.
The man, by violence or by purchase, does
the choosing—he selects the kind of woman
that pleases him.
Nature did not intend him to select; he is
not good at it.- Neither was the female in-
tended to compete—she is not good at it. If
there is a race between males for a mate,
the swiftest gets her first; but if one male
is chasing a number of females he gets the
slowest first. The one method improves our
speed ; the other does not. . . When women
became the property of men, were sold or
"given away” by their paternal owner to
their marital owner, they lost this preroga-
tive of the female, this primal duty of selec-
tion.
Thus the race has progressed only through
the male: the female was kept in the posi-
tion of a servant, and usually shut up.
Woman steps from one home —her father’s
—to another —her husband's; and never en-
ters the world—man’s world—at all. And
the male has, too, been held back by this
reactionary force.
For each man to have one whole woman to
cook for and wait on him is a poor educa-
tion for democracy... The assault upon his
heart direct, or through that proverbial side-
avenue, the stomach, which the dependent
Woman needs must make when she wants
anything, is bad for the man as well as for
her.
It is not healthy to have a loving servant
always ministering to one’s desires. Less
devotion and more knowledge, less affection
and a higher grade of skill, are needed in this
vreat business of feeding the world. We
cater to the appetite continuously. We
know what John likes ; but we do not know
m the least what the various chemicals we
daily present to him do to his unhappy inside.
Neither do we realise that this constant min-
istering service in the personal desires of
men in the home is responsible, to a terrible
extent, for their helpless self-indulgence in the
world outside. The psychic effect of “mother's
cooking” is a thing we have not considered.
No art. no science, no business can grow
far when kept to. a domestic level, when the
product of labor is for one person only, and
is governed not by knowledge, but by desire.
But surely civilised man, as the selector,
has developed beauty in the female he
chooses? Charlotte’s answer is that much
of what man calls beauty in women is not
human beauty at all, but gross over-develop-
ment of certain points which appeal to him
as a male. E.g., fatness—really an element
of weakness, inefficiency and ill-health—and
the relatively small size of woman, “deliber-
ately preferred, steadfastly chosen, and so
built into the race. In his efforts to improve
the breed of other animals, man has never
deliberately tried to cross the large and the
small, expecting to keep up the standard of
size.” Also, her long restriction to house-
limits, and the heavy limitations of clothing
have made her disproportionately short-
legged - “ squatty ” Charlotte pleasantly
terms her sex.
So, also, the lordly male, largely occupied
with his eternal combat in this man-made
world with his fellow male, has deteriorated
in appearance. There is one feature which,
as can be seen from any illustration in a
novel, he roust have —a prognathous jaw.
The possession of this bulldog feature may
enable male to conquer male, but does not
make him of any more service to Society, of
any better health, or higher beauty.
Probably the most extraordinary result of
our androcentric culture is that the human
race is the only division of the animal king-
dom in which the female decorates herself.
Everywhere else, from the peacock to the
lion, it is the male who adorns himself and
leads the fashions. He has to, to attract
the notice of the female. But the human
male has evolved for himself the mainly use-
ful but ugly garments of to-day, while :
Women wear beautiful garments when
they happen to be the fashion, and ugly gar-
ments when they are the fashion, and show
no signs of knowing the difference... .Their
condition, physical and mental, is largely
abnormal; their whole passionate absorp-
tion m dress and decoration is abnormal. . . .
AY omen are not responsible for “society,”
anv more than they are for harems. In an
androcentric culture, “society,” like every
other social relation, is dominated by the
male and arranged for his convenience.
J*
Among the many things that the male has
seized upon as his own is art; and himself
going on to lonely heights of achievement,
he has found that the world is largely Indif-
ferent to his attainments.
As the world at large consists half of
women, and wholly of their children, it would
seem patent to the meanest understanding
that the women must, be allowed to rise in
order to lift the world.
Now for man-made literature. There the
most popular stories are the story of adven-
ture and the story of love. Conflict and love
the two essential features of masculinity.
If Charlotte had her way, in every paper
there would be a “man’s column” of news,
wherein would be put all the sporting items
not world interests, but exclusivelv male
interests. As for the love story :
It is the story of the pre-marital struggle.
It is the Adventures of Him in pursuit of
Her —and it stops when he gets her! (Well,
so does She.) Story after story, this cease-
less repetition of the Preliminaries.
And why? Because this brief period out
of his whole life is the male’s one period of
overwhelming interest and excitement. Char-
lotte forgets to add that it is also the
female’s. But she suggests that if “love”
is to be selected as the most important thing
in life to write about, then the mother’s love
should be the principal subject.
But, indeed, here the author —please note
how we refrain from dubbing her authoress
—cannot be speaking of modern fiction, whose
stories frequently begin after marriage, or
cover, as in Bennett’s novels, several gener-
ations.
So Charlotte Perkins Gilman surveys the
whole man-made world of law and govern-
ment, politics and warfare, industry and
economics, ethics and religion, education and
sports, and emphasises the maleness of this
world which the males have labelled human.
But she admits the present inferiority of the
female under male domination, and, solely
on the ground that the permanent inferi-
ority of one-half of the race is a drag on our
progress, makes her plea, good for greater
opportunities for her sex’s joint partner-
ship in this difficult business of life. Worth
thinking over is her contention that the
“squatty” sex is not by choice still a cave-
dweller, but has remained short-legged be-
cause a tyrannous male has kept her too long
in the cave.
REQUIESCAT.
Dropping petals fringe the urn
On the dais of the dead,
Yellow-haloed candles burn
At her feet and shining head:
Gently! Lest a footfall rob
This new stillness swathing her,
Lest a vibrant breathing stir,
While the faintest shivering sob
Of the slow bell sinks away
Into silence perfectest:
Veil her eyelids from the day,
Cross her hands upon her breast....
Looking at her, you would say
(Would you not?) that now,‘in jest,
She had hid her eyes away,
Crossed her hands upon her breast,
Still her mouth (that, like a bud
Over God’s high garden-wall
Dropped, and on her face let fall,
Seems yet ripe with running blood)
Lest it twitch, as though it were
Prisoning a laugh, and lest
That should break, betraying her —■
Lay her hands across her breast!
When the shutter-shaft of light
Vanished with the dropping sun,
Just a moment since, 1 might,
Dreaming souls, have said that one,
Slipping up the sun-line spent
Vanished with its vanishing—
Might have thought a brushing wing
Touched my temple as it went:
Turning swiftlier, had I
Glimpsed, perchance, some splendor-drest
Thing of fire flashing by ?—
Fold her hands upon her breast.
Flowers wilt and candles fail
As did she; the Mass is said !
What shall priest and prayer avail
Her whose rest is perfected?
How shall words her stillness move?
Close the door! Perchance she stands
There within, with glimmering hands
White against the dusk, above
That which once was she, that lies
At her feet, a thing apart—
Shining head and sightless eyes,
Fingers folded on her heart.
J. Alex. Allan, in “A Wine-Sliop Madonna.”
J. Alex. Allan, the author of A Wine-
Shop Madonna, and Other Verses (Argonaut
Press, Afel.h.), is to be commended for his
moderation. His daintily printed book con-
tains only IB poems, a frontispiece, an
author’s note and the printer’s colophon.
All the verses, except one, have appeared in
The Bulletin, and the one exception is not
worth inclusion. Allan has an ear for metre
and a sensuous delight in words ; his work is
above the average in feeling, but he writes
not because he must, but because he can.
He has nothing much that needs saying,
but he does not stammer in his utterance.
This is faint praise that does not mean to
damn; for a poet who can ask:—
Was there ever a kiss that I might have
missed,
Was there ever a mistress I might have
kissed —•
That I ever missed f —
That I never kissed?
has not published in vain.
Kipling is breaking out in a now place.
“A romance of the world as science and san-
itation will have developed it in another
century” is announced to appear in an Eng-
lish magazine. Trenching on H. G. Wells’
ground.
Australia by an Australian
The only objection the critic can find with
C. E. W. Bean’s Dreadnought of the Dar-
linn (Alston Rivers, per George Robertson,
Syd.) is that the title does not tell half the
contents of the book. Bean begins with an
account of a trip down the Darling on a
river boat; but even this is no ordinary
traveller’s description of a strangely interest-
ing journey. The author ranges wide over
the whole of outback N.S.W.; and succeeds
in picturing, ostensibly for the ignorant
Englishman, but also for the equally igno-
rant suburban Australian, the sparse life
that peoples these wide spaces of the map.
Journalism it is, but extraordinarily vivid
journalism, as an exposition of outback Aus-
tralia worth a thousand acre paddock full
of Foster Frasers. ' The Dreadnought of the
Darling is a book that if picked up by the
average Australian must be read right
through. But the author of On the Wool
Trade has already gathered his audience.
This, his latest work, should immensely ex-
tend that audience. For picturesque des-
cription, accurate and extended knowledge,
and an insight into character, Bean shows
himself an author who should, in his own
line, go far.
Some extracts, which hardly represent the
full charm of the book :
“The Murray is an old, old river. In his
upper reaches perhaps he is the oldest river
that still runs. As the lives of rivers go, he
must be getting near the end of his days. It
is quite possible that there are now only a
few hundred years left between him and the
day when the old sea-fioor across which he
runs'into the sea will have been shouldered
a few hundred feet higher, and he will cease
to reach the sea at all, but will peter out
miserably in a salt, shallow clay puddle of
his own making. Ilis only hope is that by
those days the earth will have heaved up
some new mountain ranges, so as to give
him a fresh start. And the earth is quite as
likely to do the other thing. ...”
“Then we first struck mulga country. We
were crossing some low, rocky ridges, when
all the color seemed to fade out of the pic-
ture. It was as though the earth had sud-
denly fainted, or as though you were looking
at it through a blue glass ; the whole place
had that curious anaemic pallor which it
puts on when you open your eyes after shut-
ing them for a long time in the bright sun-
shine. We had seen a few grey mulga trees
before among the green scrub, but now every
tree was grey....”
“In the country, in the pastoral industry
and at the diggings, the ideal of the Aus-
tralian is still made; or, rather, the stan-
dards of pluck, hardiness, unaffectedness,
'loyalty, truthfulness, hospitality on which
the rest of Australia consciously founds its
ideal. In other words, Australians invari-
ably reserve their greatest admiration for
the man from outback ; and perhaps that, as
far as one can tell to-day, is likely to be the
great value of this outside country to Aus-
tralia. It is true it produces wool, meat,
tallow, skins, perhaps ultimately a little soap
and some glue. But in the course of that
great pastoral . industry it produces some-
thing far more valuable to the country
than all the rest, and that is—men.
“In guessing at the future of Australia, it
seems essential to remember that the Aus-
tralian. 100 to 200 years hence, will still
live with the consciousness that, if he only
goes far enough back over the hills and
across the plains, lie comes in the end to the
mysterious lialf-desert country where men
have to live the lives of strong men. And
the life of that mysterious country will
affect Australian imagination much as the
life of the sea has affected that of the Eng-
lish. It will always be there to help the
Australian to form his ideals; and one
knows of no land where they have a more
definite ideal than in Australia, or where
the whole people, men, women and even
youngsters, are more consciously employed in
working it out. One cannot help thinking
it is really the chief amusement of the Aus-
tralian... .Australia is a big, blank map,
and the whole people is constantly sitting
over it like a committee, trying to work out
the best way to fill it.”

Poets and blokes are reminded that the

a sonnet, not necessarily in Australian
slang, but one that to be understood outside
Australasia would have to be translated in-

The latest items of the N.S.W. Bookstall’s
perennial flood of shilling Australian fiction
for Australian readers are The Outlaws of
Weddin Range, the life of Ben Hall, done
into fiction by the practised hand of Am-
brose Pratt —-with, of course, the moral tag
at the end, hinting at the annoyances and
inconveniences of the bushranger’s life Pratt
had so enthusiastically and sympathetically
told; and Stella Sothern, by Ivan Archer
Rosenblum, a capably written story that de-
pends chiefly on its exciting plot—the lost
explorer, the faithful Stella, the villainous
Dasro, the bush fire and the gold mine. Yes,
they’re all there.

“After a long period of delicate health AND FINALLY A COM-
PLETE NERVE BREAKDOWN, I WAS CURED BY YOUR
WONDERFUL MEDICINE. I was a great sufferer for months,
always tired, without appetite, frightful headaches, and my nerves in
such a state that the least noise upset me. Then the end came, and I
thought I was dying. I suddenly collapsed. I was carried to bed, and
for two weeks I was not even able to sit up, the least exertion caused
my heart to beat dreadfully, and I would faint off again. The doctor’s
medicine did me no good, and after being nearly three weeks in bed,
having read a good deal of Clements Tonic, I decided to try it. After
taking one bottle I was able to sit up, AND WHEN I HAD TAKEN
FIVE I WAS ABLE TO LEAVE THE ROOM WITH THE CON-
VICTION THAT CLEMENTS TONIC WAS THE MOST
WONDERFUL MEDICINE IN THE WORLD. I have no hesita-
tion in saying I believe I would be unable to Avrite a letter to-day to you
or anybody else only for Clements Tonic. May many another sufferer
such as I was be cured by your wonderful tonic.
“ (Signed) “ MRS. BLANCHE QUINN.”

a miracle. -Vet Clements Tonic is a miraculous medicine for the relief of Nervous Break-

No woman need remain flat and undeveloped, tliin, and

to normal. It is done for hundreds of others, and can be as
readily done for you. If your bust lacks development and
firmness, and your arms, neck and shoulders are _ thin and
scrawny, even though your face is pretty, you invariably take
second place to your more fully-developed, full-bosomed asso-
ciates in your own social set. It will always be so unless you
correct the imperfections in your figure. Send a 2d. Stamp

present, have been cured in a few weeks, the worst cases responding as
readily as those only recently developed. If you are a sufferer you should

stops the pain and sub-
dues the existing inflammation. Its continued application eradicates the
accumulation that distends the veins, and restores the valves and walls to
their original healthy state.
To sufferers from Varicose Veins the Vecsey Method of treatment
comes as a great boon. Previous to its discovery no painless, permanent
palliative was known. It cures the veins absolutely, so that they do not
return. CURES without laying up or detention from business.

Tobacco habit if they knew they could

Liver or Kidney Disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harmless, vege-
table remedy that will make the user of
tobacco in any form absolutely abandon the
habit for good. It not only destroys the crav-

restores to health the entire nervous system,

A Song of Ninety Drunks.
There were immense crowds in the city last night,
but everything passed off quietly, and the police had
no trouble. About 90 drunks were locked up at the
central station, Sydney. —News item, 2/l/’l2.
Oh, the brave New Year came rolling in
With a beautiful cellar breath;
Whisky and lager, brandy and gin—
The gay New Year was brimming with sin
When its father was still in death ;
The cab horse panted beside the pave,
While the constable groped about;
Unto each strong man an arm he gave
And each, still singing, was lifted out;
Old songs he sang of the rolling wave
As they bundled him gently out.
From ev’ry quarter the New Year rolled,
In a cab with due respect;
While sirens hooted and church bells tolled,
Backward and forward he gaily rolled,
Though often his hat was wrecked;
Not yet had Sorrow been born for him,
Nor had Poverty stood revealed;
No thoughts of morning his joy could dita
As out of his carriage he reeled;
Life was a joke, not a struggle grim,
So he sang as he sagged and reeled.
They shoved him into a plain, hard cell,
And they left him alone to brood;
He sank to slumber and snored right well —
Loud foghorn music no cop could quell
In his beautiful solitude;
But now and again he woke and sang
A ditty of one in a bunk,
Who thought and thought—so the ditty rang—
On a diet of old salt junk;
And they took it up, that merry gang,
When the year was young and drunk.
When January the First goes by
This world’s a peaceful place,
Where gay cabs follow the folk who die
(Let’s hope it is neither you nor I!)
At a mournfully sober pace.
The new bills come in the same old way,
And the very same bailiffs peer;
But while we’re asking for time to pay,
We look forward to next New Year
And dream of the christ’ning wild and gay,
With the coppers and cabs and beer.

The Second Mate.
We’ve got a second mate, ’n’ ’e’s a tartar,
At times ’e doesn’t seem ter care a jot;
But I often see’d ’im thinkin’ (that wus w’en ’e
wusn’t drinkin’)—
Thinkin’ ’ard ’n’ growlin’ inward at ’is lot.
’E doesn’t seem ter know th’ name o’ civil;
’E curses ’n’ ’e scowls at us all day;
[ An’ this drinkin’, cursin’ dreamer onct wus skipper
of a steamer ;
But th’ Court suspended ’im—that’s wot they say.
For the second mate’s th’ navigatin’ orf’cer,
Th’ bloke wot makes th’ time ’n’ shoots th’ sun;
’E keeps th’ middle wotch ’n’ does ’is dooty
Ter find th’ ship’s position and th’ run.
Th’ second mate ’as ’ad ’is share o’ trouble!
’E uster be a clever bloke ’n’ smart;
But th’ flamin’ Court wot tried ’im common justice
■ it denied ’im,
And they say it nearly broke ’is blessed ’eart.
I’m sorry fer ’is Nibs w’en ’e’ gits broodin’;
I’d rather ’ear ’im rave ’n’ tear ’n’ rip ;
And I’d sorter understand it, for w’n ’e begins to
’and it —
Well, ’is language fairly shakes th’ blarsted ship !
And th’ second mate’s th’ navigatin’ orf’cer,
’E knows ’is bloomin’ work. ’E’s pretty fly !
“Keep closer to yer course, yeh blanky lubber!” —
That’s ’im. I growls “Orlright,” ’n’ winks me eye.
’E wishes now ’e’d never got a ticket;
I read that in ’is chivvy pretty slick;
For I’m good at readin’ faces, ’n’ w’en I spots ’is
grimaces,
Then I thanks me stars that I’m “afore th’ stick.”
Y’orter seen ’im one day as I see’d ’im,
Th’ skipper’d roused on ’im till all wus blue,
An’ ’e smiled at ’im so sickly that I tumbled pretty
quickly:
’E’d forgotten more’n th’ ole man ever knoo l
But th’ second mate’s th’ navigatin’ orf’cer ;
’E carries out deeiplin to a T;
’ls sextant, ’is chronometer ’n’ ftxin’s
Are ’is concern... . Wot’s that ter you ’n’ me?
But you should see th’ “second” w’en ’e’s drinkin’!
’E’s willin’ with th’ slowest bloke t’ chat!
And th’ way ’e ’as er chaffin’! —well, yeh jest carn’t
keep from larffin’
W’en ’e sez: “ ’Ere, Bill, ole boy, do this, or that!”
’E doesn’t know th’ way ter keep from smilin’;
Yeh’d think ’is life ’ad been a school-kid’s game;
But w’en ’e is orf th’ likker, we look out an’ skip
round quicker,
For ’is manner w’en ’e’s sober ain’t th’ same!
For th’ second mate’s th’ navigatin’ orf’cer;
’E’s gotter live, though owners keeps ’im down.
And all of us, like ’ens, must scratch fer tucker;
It’s starve ashore, or go to sea ’n’ drown!

some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-

the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin*” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-

A LESSON FROM TRIPOLI.
In Tripoli the badly-armed Arab and the
scarce and not too well-armed Turk appear
to be still holding off the great army and
navy of Italy. The war correspondents hav-
ing either left the Italian army, or been sup-
pressed by the censor, and the Turkish postal
arrangements, such as they were, being prac-
tically cut off by the enemy’s occupation of
the coast, information, except such as comes
from official Dago sources, is few and far
apart. And of late, owing to the rarity of
official Dago news —so far, at least, as the
land campaign is concerned —people began
to infer that there, were no tales of victory
to tell, and that the invaders were too
downhearted to invent any. The few scraps
of information that happened along all sug-
gested that Italy was still hanging on to
the coast-line, like a half-drowned female
clutching a rock. Nothing was said about
a triumphal march inland, and a series of
victories, and the scatteration of the turbu-
lent and brownish enemy, and the laying of
plans for the reorganisation and administra-
tion of the conquered country. A great deal
was made of certain scrappy adventures at
sea, but the really important subject was
covered with the cloak of reticence, and
buried in the grave of silence, with the
tombstone of obscurity above its bones.
Now, at last, some fragments of rumor drop
in from non-Italian sources, and though they
wouldn’t be worth much under ordinary cir-
cumstances, the consistent Dago murkiness
gives them an air of importance. It is al-
leged that the Mohammedans are holding on
good and hard to a line a few miles inland,
and even retain possession of the wells on
which Tripoli and the adjacent towns used
to depend for their drinking supplies. The
Italians are represented as penned up in a
narrow strip of coastal country, and often
reduced to consuming condensed or imported
water. Their army is very large, but a big
armv that is unaccustomed to desert fighting
is little better than a small one. Often it
is worse, being more cumbersome than a
small one. Their fleet is very strong, but
it.can’t wmlk overland. And Tripoli has no
Nile to supply an easy way to the interior.
It all suggests a gloomy outlook for the
invaders. Even if Turkey could be driven
to conclude a peace by which Tripoli was
handed over to the Dago kingdom there is
no reason to suppose that the Tripolitan
would take any notice of the arrangement, or
that the Turk could make him take notice of
it, or that the Turk would really w r ant to
make him take notice of it. The only
change would be that the war would become
technically a rebellion instead of a strife
between nations, but it isn’t likely that the
Tripolitan cares what it is called. If it
were called a Bible or a boiling spring it
would suit him equally well. The situation
is that there is a very large hornet’s nest in
a very inaccessible position. Turkey says
the inmates of the nest are its old and long-
established hornets, while Italy says that it
has just annexed the hornets. Even if the
Turks grow tired of the argument and tell
the Italians they are welcome to take the
whole darned crowd of hornets, the trouble
will remain much as before. It suggests
giving an infant a wild elephant as a birth-
day present, the animal being then at large
in its native forest and only in need of cap-
ture.
Just here or hereabouts is the place where
the anti-Defence person of Australia will
presently arise and point out that any large
expenditure on Defence preparations is
waste of money, and that what an untrained
or half-trained Tripolitan army can do in the
way of holding its country against fearful
paper odds an amateur Australian force,
raised on the spur of the moment, can do as
well, or better. And the anti-Defence
person will be the same unreasoning fraud
as usual. The strength of the Tripolitan
defence lies in the poverty and misery of the
country. When the hard-fighting man with
the fez retreated from his biggest city, he
had the blessed advantage of leaving his
enemy’s fleet at a very difficult anchorage,
because the unspeakable Turk had built no
breakwater, nor had he dredged out the
alleged harbor. In fact, the Tripolitan,
having no commerce worth speaking of,
wasn’t driven to make arrangements to ac-
commodate either his own ships or a
hostile squadron. When he fled in-
land he only deserted to the invader
a rambling town capable of holding
about 40,000 inhabitants, and the smaller
the town the easier it is for its in-
mates to flee into the wilderness and live on
locusts and wild honey. He left behind him
no valuable furniture or works of art or
priceless libraries; no cash in the banks, for
he owned no banks, and the visible cash was
about twopence ; no tramcars, ships or
trains. He sacrificed no costly docks, foun-
dries, engineering shops or factories. The mer-
chandise abandoned in shops and ware-
houses, after removing as much as possible
per mule, was hardly worth mentioning.
Mr. Tripoli didn’t even leave a decent pave-
ment behind him for the Italian to steal and
hang on his watch-chain, or a first-class
hotel, or a Y.M.C.A., or a House of Parlia-
ment, or a mayor and corporation, or a single
capable policeman. He took his rifle with
him, and the cannon he didn’t take with him
were as old as Beelzebub, and twice as
cracked as the Salvation Army.
* * * *
Furthermore, it wasn’t necessary for this
swift Mohammedan to cut the railway as he
evacuated old Tripoli, or to guard it against
seizure by the enemy as an alternative to
cutting it, for there was no railway. He
didn’t require to cover the roads behind him
with a strong rearguard, for there were no
roads —only a huge cloud of dust and a tre-
mendous buzz of insects. No regiments were
wasted in a desperate fight for the possession
of the city’s Prospect reservoir and Cataract
dam, or its Yan Yean water supply, or any-
thing of that sort, for the city water was
brought in per cart, or in a goat-skin bag on
a brown man’s back from wells some
distance inland. When the Italians
captured the metropolis on the coast
they didn’t even capture a reliable
drink of water. When the Mohammedans
retired into the desert they retired into a
place which was just about as good as the
metropolis, and which suited many of them
just as well. The dust was the same; the
garbage was less; the facilities for leading
the Higher Life weren’t much different.
They weren’t in the position which the popu-
lation of Sydney would occupy if it had to
abandon the beer and fleshpots of its city
and betake itself to the horrors of Tiboo-
burra. They left the enemy a million smells
and a few billion germs and sundry tunnels
and dead fortifications, and went themselves
to the fresh air and the springs. Because of
the lack of roads and railways they could
make their position as strong by retreating
15 miles as the population of a civilised
capital could if it fled 100 or perhaps 500
miles. Tripoli fell back on the entrenchment
of its ignorance, and got behind the solid
wall of its ancient retrogression. And the
Italians can’t depress its spirits by marching
inland and taking Bathurst and Goulburn
and Bendigo and Ballarat and Kalgoorlie.
It escapes depression by having no such
places.
The Tripolitan defence is interesting, as
revealing how a country with hardly
anything to lose can hold its own
against an enemy who gets annoyed
when he doesn’t capture anything worth
having. But it only shows Australia
how not to do things. A community with a
complex civilisation, including great coastal
cities, railways, tramways, telegraphs, tele-
phones, banks, insurance offices, a Federal
note issue, a huge public debt, a vast
gold reserve, old age pensions, theatres,
opera houses, mortgages, newspapers, docks,
shipping, ferry boats, Owe’Sulltvan’s won-
derful railway station, the largest com-
merce per head on earth, water-
works, gas-works, Speaker Willis, the fort
at Pinchgut, the merry-go-rounds at Manly,
and the like, can’t retire in a great dust-
cloud at a moment’s notice, feeling hardly
any poorer, and leaving its enemy no richer.
It has got to stand and fight, and to do that
it requires the means and apparatus for
fighting. If it did retreat, it has been spoiled
by the luxury of abundant baths and plenty
of tram-cars for the kind of life that the
wilderness would offer it. It has built too
many roads to make Granville a place where
a motley army could stand at bay, and wave
a green banner, and threaten the foreign
garrison of Sydney with death by thirst. It
would be struck by a serious trouble long
before it reached Granville. By the time the
retreat had got as far as Newtown, the
country would probably have made default
on its public debt, and hopelessly wrecked
its credit —-a disadvantage to which the
Tripolitan is a stranger, for he never had
any credit. Civilisation has its responsi-
bilities and its drawbacks. One of the draw-
backs is that the old, cheap, cursory methods
of defence don’t fit the case.
A STATE MINISTER WHO IS LABOR
BY TRADE AND “LIBERAL” BY
CONVICTION.
Attorney-General W. A. Holman, of
N. S. Wales, appears to think that any
frayed old yarn will do for use against the
Nationalist policy—so long as the tattered
circumstance is repeated often enough. He
claimed last week, for about the 700th time,
to be all for the New Protection, and all for
legislation which would curb or destroy in-
jurious monopolies, but wound up with the
announcement that: —
He could not see how the proposal to hand over
the control of domestic commerce to the Federal Par-
liament was in any way involved in effectuating the
widest ideals of the party to which he belonged.
It is the unconvincing, hypocritical old gag
that was trotted out daily and nightly
throughout the recent Referenda campaign,
by every Tory orator in the Commonwealth.
Such determined anti-Laborites as Irvine,
Cook, Wade and Garland repeatedly ex-
plained that they considered the New Pro-
tection ah excellent measure, and one that
would be supported by 90 per cent, of Aus-
tralians if it could be submitted, by itself,
in the form of a referendum question. Also,
they said that they wanted to see monopolies
efficiently controlled —though, in those days,
there was a tendency amongst the “Liberals”
to put up the bluff that injurious vends
didn’t and couldn’t exist here. But, on one
point, the entire gang whs absolutely solid.
Much as they yearned to see the manufac-
turer compelled by law to pay his hands
wages commensurate to the profits his in-
dustry was earning with the help of the
tariff; and earnest as they were in the good
cause of anti-Trustism, they firmly declined
to accept these boons at the price of an
amendment of the “Trade and Commerce”
clause in the Federal Constitution. They
protested in the sacred name of State Rights
against any such revolutionary change.
Holman’s pronouncement, in this connec-
tion, last week, was identically the same as
the pronouncements of ripe old Tories like
Bruce Smith during the early part of last
year. Said this amazing “democrat”: —
It (i.e., the proposed amendment) carried the most
serious consequences to the governing powers of the
States. Such a sweeping accession of power would
include all the instruments of commerce. Every one
of the agencies employed in domestic commerce would
be an agency subject to the exclusive control of the
Federal Parliament. Among the instruments of do-
mestic commerce were roads. It would be within the
Federal Government’s power then to strip the local
governing bodies of their powers. The railways
would similarly pass under Federal control. He did
not think those who put the Referenda proposals for-
ward fully realised this.
Domestic commerce itself was so universal that the
transfer of so wide a power would practically leave
all the vital powers outside the hands of the State
Parliaments. He failed to see, in that position, why
the State Governments should continue. It was a
most revolutionary change in the relations of the
States and the Federation. It would injure the States
without having any compensating Federal benefit.
* * • •
The danger that Holman, in common
with the “Liberal” party, sees, or affects to
see, ahead, is that the Australian Parlia-
ment, if vested with certain new powers in
regard to trade and commerce, inay at once
proceed to wickedly abuse them. Willie
Kelly invested the beginning of the Refer-
enda campaign with an element of low
comedy, not to say knockabout farce, by re-
tailing to a number of astounded old ladies
and flappers in Paddington (Sydney), a
number of the things that the Federal Par-
liament might do if his hearers didn’t vote
“No” to the “sweeping accession of legisla-
tive power” which the Federal Labor party
was demanding. “Give us this power,”
prattled William, agitatedly, “and we may
nationalise every fruit and lolly shop, every
newspaper stall, and every oyster joint in
the land. We may take over the ferry boats
and charge you ss. apiece to travel from Mil-
son’s Point to Circular Quay. We may re-
sume every ice-cream barrow in the Com-
monwealth, put our own officials in charge
of the vehicles, and sell inferior ices for
thrice —aye! ten times their present price.
We may seize and run in the most demented
fashion conceivable all the grocery shops,
butcheries, gin-palaces, warehouses, trams,
trains and ’buses in the land ; and there will
be none to say us nay, for Freedom will have
gone out of the business with a shriek, and
wire-stealing will have become a thing of
the golden past—the State Rights party
having been strangled and forever buried.”
He mayn’t have used those exact words, but
they faithfully represent the sense of his
observations. The foolish females wandered
out into the night air in a semi-paralysed
frame of mind. They didn’t reflect that
State legislators have for years enjoyed free
license to do all these things, and more, and
yet have never essaved any of them. Under
the N. S. Wales Constitution the members
of the Government to which W. A. Holman
owes allegiance ‘may, if they wish, pass a
law compelling every citizen of Sydney to
traverse George-street, one or more times
daily, on his or her hands and knees. They
ma Tr resume the Australia Hotel, and
turn it into a combined flat and winter-
jungle for the chimpanzee at the Tivoli
Theatre: likewise, they may burn all the
houses in Balmain that happen to have
striped blinds, and raze every church and
chapel in the State to the earth. In short,
there is no end to the wild things that the
State Parliament may 1 : do—but doesn’t.
It doesn’t do them for the same reason that
no conceivable Australian Parliament is
likely to do the mad, inequitable deeds which
State Frightism pictures as a necessary cor-
ollary of the “sweeping accession of power”
resulting from the “revolutionary change”
that Holman dreads, or pretends to dread —
namely, the simple, patent facts that Minis-
ters and members of Parliament mostly
want to hold their jobs, and that, to do
things which are (1) insane and (2) con-
trary to the public interest, represents the
surest means of losing those jobs and never
getting others.
The above are the oft-stated reasons why
the whole of the “Liberal” or anti-Aus-
tralian party, and such false-alarm demo-
crats as W. A. Holman, object to a Consti-
tutional amendment, which is at the very
root of the national policy. By themselves,
these arguments are a shade too thin to
carry weight with any but “Liberal”
females, commercial mfcn, cheap clerks and
the like, who are notoriously illiterate in a
political manner of speaking. So Holman
has to attempt some further justification of
his anti-Labor attitude, and he does it by
affecting to treat the principle which ap-
pears so vital to his Federal brethren as
quite negligible. “What Labor interest
necessitated this change?” he asked, ingenu-
ously, last week. The answer is that the
New Protection is a Labor interest, and that
Commonwealth control of monopolies (which
is to say, the only possible control wfiicli is
going to be effective) is a Labor interest,
and that neither of these reforms is likely
to be achieved so long as the Trade and
Commerce clause stands in its present form.
This view has been laid down, in set terms,
by W. H. Irvine, B. R. Wise, W. M.
Hughes, and every other Constitutional
lawyer of note —whether “Liberal” or
Labor —in Australia, and it has been up-
held by repeated decisions of the High
Court. The Excise Act was that feature of
the New Protection which had for its object
the securing of fair wages to employees. No
one disputed the justice or desirability of
the measure. But the High Court found
in Rex v. Barger that “even if this Act
were a proper exercise of the Common-
wealth’s powers of taxation, yet it was bad,
because it infringed upon the implied pro-
hibition against interference with the inter-
nal trade and commerce of the States.” In
other words, the Excise Act was killed by
the clause' whose amendment, according to
W. A. Holman, is not necessary in the inte-
rests of Labor. The Australian Parliament
thought it had power to make effective
anti-Trust laws. Also, without the slight-
est doubt, the vast majority of the electors
wished the National Parliament to have
that power. With the object of ensuring
that the consumer should stand on as good
a wicket, financially, as the manufacturers
on the one hand and the manufacturers’
employees on the other, Parliament pro-
ceeded to “make laws respecting trading or
financial corporations formed within the
limits of the Commonwealth.” The High
Court decided in Appleton’s case that “if
the words, ‘trading or financial corporations,
etc.,’ stood alone, without any qualifying
or controlling context, they might be capa-
ble of bearing the construction contended
for by the Commonwealth Parliament. But
if,” the Court proceeded, “Parliament can
declare an act of a trading or financial cor-
poration, which is lawful under State law,
to be unlawful under Federal 1aw.... this
is a flagrant invasion of the powers of the
States to make laws in respect of their own
internal trade and commerce.” The prac-
tical effect of that judgment was to give
Trusts the freest of legs in Australia. And
alleged Laborites of the Holman stamp
can’t see what Labor interests necessitate
a change in such a state of affairs!
* * * *
The Holman alternative to the amend-
ment of a Constitutional clause which has
nullified practically all the industrial re-
forms attempted by the Australian Parlia-
ment, is, seemingly, some vague scheme
based on a unanimous handing-over of cer-
tain powers by the States to the Common-
wealth. Setting aside the circumstances
that unanimity in regard to free gifts of the
sort is not usual where State Governments
are concerned, anu that, at the very best
and brightest, there is no likelihood of such
a scheme coming to anything for years,
while more Trusts are arising, and more
wage-earners are being sweated every week,
Holman’s proposal exhibits him in the
anomalous light of one who poses as a
democrat, and yet fears to trust the demo-
cracy. The fresh powers asked for by the
Nationalists are not to be handed to for-
eigners, but to Australians — Holman’s own
countrymen, returned to Parliament on the
most democratic franchise in the world. Of
what is he afraid? To the impartial on-
looker it appears that his fears are bunkum,
and that he is merely playing the old game
of the immemorial Tory obstructionist
i.e., clouding the real issue by means of
vague, horrible threats, and putting forward
impracticable proposals in order that demo-
cratic measures may be delayed or defeated.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Sydney’s Wonderful Kailway Station.
It is possible to talk* so long and unani-
mously about the urgency of a work that
everybody loses all inclination to do it. That
is to say, if the work were done, nobody-
could talk any longer about the urgent need!
of doing it, and that subject of conversation,
having become an institution, life would be
a blank without it. The case is akin to.
that of the Society for the Conversion of the.
Jews. It exists to convert all Jews, but ifc
doesn’t want to do it, because, if it did it, the
society would lose its job, and might have
to take to repairing the roads. It is on ai
somewhat similar nrinciple that the N.S.W.
Government is still talking about the des-
perate need for a Sydney city railway, and
a lot of new suburban lines, and tube rail-
ways, and railway communication across the
harbor, just as many of these works have
been talked of for the last 50 years, and yet
it isn’t digging the first hole or laying the
first brick of any one of them. Rather, it talks
vaguely about referring them, for the 10th
or 50th time, to a committee of inquiry, or


some such refuge of undecided politicians. On
the other hand, it proposes to go ahead im-
mediately, and at a cost of nearly £2OO 000
ilwhoenlargement and completion of the
mi solaced terminus—that palatial
Sdle out near Redfern The great Owe’-
Sullivan mistake is bad enough as things
stand, hut it isn’t too late to repair it,
whereas, if it is anchored down on its arti-
ficial hump by such a vast amount of new
Sowed money, it will probably become a
permanency. Its great drawback is that,
as it stands, it is only fitted to be a terminus.
The trains come in on an up-grade, and end
their journey on top of n m3.nufn.ctui ed hill, so
that they won’t be liable to arrive at a pace
that is beyond reason or control, and knock
the dead end to perdition that dead end that
shouldn't be there. If the line is extended
through the city and across the harbor, as it
ought to be, then either the whole place must
be reconstructed, or else the trains must re-
sume their journey by falling over a preci-
pice. No one would have built such a place
unless he was under the delusion that he
was the last word in railway extension, and
that, after him, everything was finished. The
only advantage that has ever been claimed
for the misdirected castle at Itedfern is that
it is “central,” which is about the worst
thing that could be said for it. The beastly
centralness of the place has been its undoing.
When a large city has only one line, and it
ends in the centre of the place, the natural
result is that the line only traverses half
the city, and the other half has no line at
all. The failure of the central policy is evi-
denced by the fact that the Railway Depart-
ment runs a line of trams to carry the rail-
wav passengers the rest of the way, and how
little use the bulk of these passengers have
for the “central” station is evidenced by the
facts that three-fourths or more of them
rush for the trams and hang on like grim
death till they get to about Iving-street.
The present central station would have some
points as a terminus for trains coming in
from the northern suburbs and crossing the
harbor, but the folk from the southern and
western suburbs want their final stopping
place not far from Circular Quay. In other
words, the line should run right through,
and a main suburban train should be a train
running from Parramatta or Ilomebush. to
somewhere in the vicinity of Hornsby, while
branches from the eastern suburbs should
join the main line somewhere in the city.
But no city railway system would fit in
with the plan of a big station when the
trains stop three stairs up, so to speak, and
can’t progress any further unless they throw
themselves out of the front window and
arrive with a crash in the street below. It
was expressly devised to prevent extension.
When the folly began to be realised, various
attempts were made to explain away the
position, and plans were drawn showing how
a sort of twopenny branch line might be
carried into the city from the basement of
the amazing structure (there was something
humorous about the idea of the biggest and
proudest city in Australasia being content
with a branch, as if it were Gundagai or
Brewarrina). Yet the old blunder refused to
be covered up, and if another £175,000 or
£200.000 is spent on it, it will be the same
old blunder, only bigger and madder and
more conspicuous.
——.—
A Bridge and Its Relation to Party Politics.
From the S. M. Herald (18/1/T2) :
We cannot imagine the very serious matter of con-
nection with North Sydney by bridge or tunnel being
delayed as it is if that constituency were represented
'by a Labor member, or if Labor constituencies were
‘clamoring for relief.
It is the identical tip which this paper of-
fered the Northern Suburbs last month. For
years the short-sighted little snobs, who are
in the majority on the other side of the
water (the three-hundred-a-year millionaires,
as someone has called them) have been vot-
ing the Tory ticket With an unwearying
fidelity, which is rarely to be found outside
the kennel. As a natural result, the yearn-
ings of Gordon,- St. Leonards, Middle Harbor
and Lane Cove have been simply scouted by
the “Liberal” party bosses during the de-
cades that they have held the keys of the
Treasury. The party organisers have hardly
troubled to throw to these reliably anti-Labor
constituencies the mendacious promise which
cheers, even if it doesn’t inebriate, the
hearer with hope and joy. Actually, the other
day, C. G. Wade, who represents Gordon,
had the cynical nerve to go up-country and
denounce the idea of blewing money on the
bridging of Sydney Harbor, while there were
deserving primary producers clamoring for
more railways in the backblocks. A rare
liberty to take with a constituency like Gor-
don, which is understood to regularly incor-
porate a request for a bridge with its grace
before meat. It was ever thus under party
government. North Sydney’s tragedy is that
it has nothing to sell, in a manner of speak-
ing. The “Liberal” League or Caucus, which
has most say, in the last resort, regarding
the way in which the cash at the disposal
of the party shall be expended for anti-
Labor purposes, would no more dream of
wasting big grants on the faithful of Wah-
roonga, Turramurra, etc., than a sane house-
holder Would dream of offering an immense
subsidy for the affection of his aged gardener.
People don’t want their gardeners’ love. All
they do want is to be got for a sovereign a
week, or thereabouts, and they know it.
“Liberalism” has got all it wanted out of
North Sydney, in the past, for the price
of a few school-houses and drill-halls.
To squander a vast bridge on the district,
when there are scores of doubtful constitu-
encies waiting to be won over by means of
railways and so on, would be such rotten bad
business from the party standpoint, that the
politician who suggested it would inspire his
colleagues with doubts as to his sanity. Tlie
McGowen Ministry has talked largely about
the harbor connection (just as every other
Ministry has done), but, on all the evidence,
it is- not going to attempt one iota more than
“Liberalism” has attempted—chiefly because
Labor can see no tactical points about pam-
pering a batch of constituencies which have
always been bitterly hostile to it, and" which
show no signs of changing. And, meanwhile,
North Sydney remains as distant from the
goal it hungers for as it was half a century
ago. There are two ways in which the un-
pleasantness might be remedied. One is for
the Northern Suburbs to take the S. M.
Herald’s gentle hint, and elect a Labor
member or two. The oth«r is
them to join in the agitation, which
is gradually gaining ground in Aus-
tralia, for the purpose of abolishing
party government. Till one of these changes
materialises, the North Sydneyite is going
to risk his life and lose his time on com-
fortless ferry craft, as before.
A Bill that Grows Bigger Every Day.
THE.State Premiers who foregathered at Mel-
bourne pottered round somewhat with the
question of a uniform railway gauge. Every
conference potters more or less with that
well-worn subject, and one that didn’t pot-
ter would be null and blank, and no real
conference at all, but a base imitation with-
out the name blown in the bottle. The
lack of results was much as usual, and the
three unfinished failures which it arrived
at were the old familiar three: (l)It didn’t
contrive to decide which gauge it would
like to have; (2) it didn’t resolve how to
set about establishing that gauge, sup-
posing it knew which gauge it was;
and (3) it got no nearer to finding
out how to allocate among the differ-
ent States the cost of establishing the
gauge it was unable to decide on. Of course,
there is a remedy, but the State Premiers
become so heated when it is mentioned that
a steam rises from their heads. The plain
and easy way out of the difficulty is to hand
over the whole blessed railway system to the
Commonwealth, taking its solemn league
and covenant that it will establish a uni-
form ga”uge within a certain period. Then
it could charge the bill to the general rev-
enue, and thus there would be no question
about any division or subdivision of the
bill. If it was considered unnecessary to
interfere with the isolated Tasmanian sys-
tem it would only be necessary t« calculate
how much pm- head the reconstruction had
cost, and refund Tassy its share —or take
over a corresponding bit of the little soot’s
public debt. But the dignity of State Frights
revolts at this obvious way out of the diffi-
culty, and the cantankerousness of State
Frights—each Fright being unable to agree
with any other Fright save in the matter of
hostility to Australia —has always • pre-
vented them doing anything for themselves.
So time rolls on, and, meanwhile, the Frights
are building miles and miles of new railway,
most of which will have to be reconstructed.
The inability of either the Frights or the
Commonwealth to realise that this question
requires to be settled in boiling-hot haste is
expensive. The work must be done some
day, and every day’s hesitation probably
adds £IOOO or £2OOO, or it may be even
more, to the bill that must be paid in the
end.

The Sydney Wharf Labor Difficulty.
A report is on deck to the effect that the
Sydney wharf trouble will be settled, if it
hasn’t already been settled, by private
negotiation. It has been a dreary sort of
business all through. The matter was sup-
posed to have been fixed up by arbitration
some time ago, but there w T as presently a
disagreement, and the same old strike. Then
there was another reference to the Arbitra-
tion Court, and another arrangement. The
employees obeyed part of the award, and
took, no notice of another part—one which
didn’t please them —and nothing happened.
There was a period of semi-deadlock,
and finally an appeal, the other day, to
Minister Beeby. He was asked if the
award would be enforced or not. The reply
was vague and dodgy. It included an allusion
to the wages paid in Melbourne, a complaint
about newspaper criticism, and a sort of
lamentation about the Government’s failure
to get its new Arbitration Bill through last
session. But the fact stuck out conspicu-
ously that there would be no attempt to
enforce the awards of the Arbitration Court
—against the employees, anyhow—so the
. old method of private negotiation is re-
sorted to, and, if it fails, presumably there
will be the old strike. This is, presumably,
the end of compulsory arbitration in N.S.W.
industrial disputes—for the time, at least.
The Government —not having the courage to
enforce the law-—now apparently proposes to
go back to the old voluntary conciliation
method, by which a Court arbitrates if both
parties to the dispute are agreeable, and the
parties accept its decision if they both feel
like it. It is a good arrangement for the
workers while the boom is going strong, and
the demand for labor exceeds the supply.
But it is desperately bad for then in dull
times when work is scarce, as was proved
by the case of the old N.S.W. Conciliation
Court, which had some two or three matters
brought before it in all its useless career,
and did no good with them. Its trouble
wins that when the employees wanted to
conciliate, the employers didn’t, and vice
versa. The weak party always said “Yes,”
and the strong one said “No,” and the em-
ployers then represented the strong party.
Ih days of poverty it is the capitalist who
requires to be coerced to make him live up
to his agreement, and it is then that the
workers are liable to be very sorry if the
habit of enforcing awards has been dropped
and the machinery of compulsion has gone
to the scrap-heap. Already there are signs
that the boom has seen its best days; so,
if compulsory arbitration is abandoned, it
may finally disappear just about the time
when the aggregate boss is very glad to do
without it.

The Troubles of Bathurst and Its Show.
Some day, in straining after a point to take
against Labor, N. S. Wales “Liberalism”
will assuredly burst, and ruin a large por-
tion of the surrounding scenery. Its latest
grievance ’arises from the scurvy treatment
the McGowen Government is represented to
have accorded Bathurst (N.S.W.) in deny-
ing it certain moneys. The S. M. Hekaed
opened out as follows on the subject:—
If a Government chooses, or is Obliged, to squander
its income on Socialistic enterprises, which promise
to involve great risks, it naturally has not the money
available for legitimate public works. No words of
condemnation' can be too strong for such a state of
affairs, but it is hopeless to expect any improvement
while Parliament remains in its present incompetent
condition, and we fear that Mr. Miller’s protest
will prove of little avail.
Miller is the M.L.A. for Bathurst, and here
is his published protest against the “legiti-
mate public works” which have been denied
his constituency:—
A Labor Minister has refused the request for a
national show for Bathurst, and, moreover, has de-
layed the improvements to the model farm, simply
bpcause both had been promised by a Liberal Min-
ister.
In the first place, this enraged politician
holds his seat on the understanding that he
is an anti-Socialist. The bulk of his sup-
porters claim to regard Socialism as some-
thing demented and wrong. But a “Na-
tional Show” is merely a euphemism for a
"Socialistic Show.” Not only does this
variety of Show pocket the usual £ for £
subsidy, but it also pouches a further grant
of £SOO or more from the chronically bleed-
ing State. In fact, it is as much State-
owned to all intents and purposes, as the
Sydney tramway system. If there were any
consistency in Miller and the false-alarm
anti-Socialists who support him, the entire
crowd would be found protesting as deter-
minedly against the violation of their prin-
ciples that is expressed in the proposal for a
State-run Show, as the Bathurst laborites
would protest against an agitation for the
de-nationalisation of the railways. But con-
sistency and logic are things that the back-
blocks “Liberal” does not know by sight
when the prospect of tearing money out of
the State looms ahead. As a matter of fact,
the McGowen Government has done well to
shut down on the “National Show” swindle.
And it will be a glad day for the community
at large when a Government materialises
with sufficient backbone to reform the exist-
ing arrangement of subdising Shows, lock,
stock and barrel. Bathurst presents a par-
ticularly horrible example of the evil effects
of the system. It runs one of the biggest
Shows in Australia. Thousands flock to it
every year, from all over the State. But its
attraction, as regards the vast majority of
its patrons, has about as much relation to
agriculture or to horticulture or to the pas-
toral industry, as a race-meeting has to the
cult of Wowserism. The “ring events” con-
stitute the chief lures. Here trained high-
jumping horses (miscalled “hunters”), ani-
mals which are utterly useless for any but
Show or circus purposes, amuse the crowd
by the hour. Trotting exhibitions, which
are really ; races, give the betting enthusiast
opportunities to back his fancy. Trick-riding,
buck-jumping contests, ladies’ hurdle events,
tandem r&ces, an| so on, draw well. And
then there are the "“side shows.” The letting
of booths and stands to the folk who run
Fat Women exhibits, Aunt Sallies, bars, etc.,
brings in considerable revenue to the promot-
ers of these concerns; and, in some cases,
A.. 11. and P. Societies have been known to
take the Government down for several addi-
tional hundreds per annum, in the matter of
£ for £• subsidy money, by faking the ac-
counts between themselves and the showmen.
In short, many of the A., H. and P. Shows,
though prosperous, are rotten. The only
unquestionable use they serve is to provide
the district where they occur with a magnifi-
cent two or three days’ circus, at Socialistic
prices. As against this, they mop up Social-
istic money, which might be better applied
in a hundred different directions. The idea
that such institutions should be rendered
even more bloated than they are, by means of
further public . grants, is absolutely gro-
tesque. What’most of them need is to be
put on a diet of financial starvation till they
pledge themselves to cease being gigantic vau-
deville entertainments, and to devote them-
selves to the ends for which they were
formed.
r ihe Cause of the Diverse Railway Gauges.
The S. M. Herald adopted a painfully su-
perior attitude towards Victoria when the
latter, the other day, asked the Ma State to
put her hand in her pocket and help in con-
verting the Victorian railways from the sft.
3in. to the 4ft, gauge
Since the change must he made, surely it would be
mere madness to choose a wide gauge simply because
V ictoria made the mistake of having one, and, like
the fox in the fable who had lost his tail, expects all
the rest of us to imitate her. The truth of the
matter is that Victoria is disinclined to do her duty
to the Commonwealth.. . . But those States that have
the standard gauge, and the Commonwealth, which is
about to build its transcontinentals to it, have no
real responsibility for Victoria’s policy, and they
could not reasonably be expected to shoulder her
burdens.
As a matter of fact, N.S.W. has all the re-
sponsibility in the unfortunate matter. The
Sydney Railroad and Tramway Co. pushed
an Act _ through the N.S.W. Parliament,
making it compulsory that all railways, in
the State should be built on the sft. Sin.
gauge, and Victoria and S. Aus. were ofli
cially informed* of the measure. They
both growled at not having being con-
sulted about what ought to have been
a Federal matter; but Ma was a
bumptious and arrogant Ma, then, just
as she is now; so, accepting the situa-
tion, the Vic. railway authorities —two pri-
vate cos. just starting—placed large orders
for sft. 3in. rolling stock, and S.A. did like-
wise. After _ they had got a lot of work
done, Ma, with her usual inability to keep
faith, changed her mind, and passed another
Act repealing the first; whereupon the
N.S.W. line was built on the 4ft. B£in.
gauge. It was this shuffling of Ma that
caused the whole of the present vast trouble.
N.S.W. first beguiled or bullied the two
southern States into adopting the sft. Sin.
gauge, which they didn’t really want, and
then deserted them. Both in selecting the
sft. 3in. gauge, and the 4ft. BJin. one, it
acted as the usual immensely self-important
old character who professed to give the law
to all Australia. In the matter of tin*
change to 4ft. S-jin., it hadn’t even the
decency to notify its neighbors that it had
left them in the lurch.
We—and Our Friend with the Armed Fist.
Something about the friend’s training:—
The small brown men who have been swarming
like white ants over Sydney don’t belong to a nation
that trusts to luck and the school-kid for its defence.
The Jap law requires service from all able-bodied
males of from 17 to 40 —-first preparatory service,
then, at 20, active service, and afterwards reserve
service and depot service. Nobocly, with one excep-
tion, can dodge it if he isn’t a cripple ; the exception
is the only son of a parent of over 60, who is judged
unable to support himself without the son’s help.
The gilded youngster may, as usual, crawl out with
some slight concession ; but even he has to “possess
scholarship at least equal to that of graduate of the
Middle School” ; and the Jap can’t, as a rule, enter
the Middle School until he has had six years at the
Primary School, and he must do another five at the
Middle School before he can graduate. Even this
gilded young scholar’s concession only permits him
to escape with what is known as one-year service-
barrack service, that is. Having got that licking he is
passed to the reserves, and is liable to be called out
for shooting practice like the rest’of them. In 1909
—last figures available—s69,3l7 Jap lings were sum-
moned for the universal-service examination, and all
but 113,318 were passed on to learn' how to defend
their own country or collar somebody else’s. Those
113,318 were temporarily exempted for these reasons:
Necessity to support the family .. 623
Studying at schools . . . . . . 42,394
Studying abroad . . . . . . 33,275
Missing, or under criminal trial . . 27,861
Convicted . . . . . . . . 434
111, etc. 8,731
Total 113,318
The school-teacher is put in a separate class; he gets
six weeks’ training, and is then sent to “terri-
torial service.” The youngster who can’t climb up to
the dizzy height of sft. 3iim can't be an A 1 soldier,
and is passed on to the transport or some such ser-
vice—or, apparently, the navy. The navy is mostly
manned by volunteers, though if there are not enough
of them forthcoming, the complement is drafted in
from the universal-service roll. Thus, in 1907, when
the volunteers didn’t come along freely enough, the
figures were: Volunteers, 4048; drafted, 4564. The
active service in the navy lasts four years and the re-
serve service seven. Youngsters who expect to be-
come officers are attached to either the Naval Cadet
Academy or the Naval Engineering School. The
course runs four years in each instance, “including
one year of practical training on distant voyage”—
which explains the present swarm of white ants.
There are other colleges, but they are not for the
cub —they are for the subsequent production of the
specialist. But not for the officer alone. Thus, the
ordinary artificer on board may go into the Mechanic
School and take a course; but, in return, he must
stay in the service for an extra three or four years.
As for pay, the Japling who is under training in the
army, gets from 156 to 195 sen a month, and a sen is
a farthing or thereabouts. But besides his 3s. 3d. to
4s. a month, he gets 4d. to 6d. to cover the cost of
writing home to mother, and 2d. a day to buy food
to supplement his allowance of rice. Not that there
isn’t other food in the army besides rice, as a rule;
but the Jap Government is a lavish affair, and throws
the 2d. in for luck, and in case the poultry caught
in the rice shouldn’t be as good as it might be.
\ Q
“A Young Soldier” writes :
The decay of Australia’s compulsory military kid-
training becomes more and more obvious. At the be-
ginning, a few of the youths who were liable for ser-
vice, refused to turn up, and scored at the idea of
learning to defend their native land. If they—or
their parents—had been promptly suppressed, accord-
ing to law, the trouble would probably have ended
there. But a humanitarian Government wanted com-
pulsory training without compulsion. It wanted to
get the applause of the people who believed in Aus-
tralian defence, and not lose the support of those who
didn’t. It was the sort of Government that was
strongly patriotic, and at the same time wouldn’t
speak unkindly to a caterpillar. So the youths who
scoffed and remained away became more numerous,
and though the law gives officers certain (yery
limited) powers of summary jurisdiction, they wore
forbidden to use them. The blessed Government Sus-
pended the law. Then the youths who didn’t actually
scoff began to remain away, or their parents made
them remain away. Universal training puts all on a
lev,el, but when one youth spent part of his time at-
tending drills and another didn’t, the law-keeper pre-
sently found himself at a disadvan.*ge in the indus-
trial market as against the law-breaker-—the hoodlum
who jeered at the idea of military training, and
called his officer “turkey legs.” As the Government
kept all its sympathies for the law-breaker the disease
spread. Some absentees —youths employed at the
Victorian State coal mine—declared that they were
threatened by a mine official with loss of a shift if
they attended drill, and nothing happened to the
official. All that happened was that the matter was
hung up for three months. Officers, left with practi-
cally no power, are growing weary of the business.
Now the second year’s recruits are due for enrolment,
but so far they aren’t enrolling to any great extent.
A conviction is spreading that Defence is all a moth-
eaten election jest. Possibly it will require tome
thousands of prosecutions to produce the same effect
now that could have been effected not many month*
Daughters of the Horseleech.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. G. S. Br'EBY, Minister for Lands, called at
Blaekheath on Saturday on his way to Litligow, and
received a deputation at the School of Arts.
Mr. G. Phillips asked for a special grant to clear
the local cemetery.
Mr. John Nbjate, jun., urged the Minister to make
a special grant' to properly rail the more exposed por-
tions in the Grand Canyon.
Mr. H. J. Collier asked for a grant on behalf of <
the four town parks.
Mr. H. R. Neate urged the resumption of an acre
of land next the school.
Mr. Beeby said something would be done as to the
cemetery. He was in sympathy with the extension
of the school grounds, and would see what could be
done as to the town parks and the Grand Canyon.
— Casual, customary par. in S. M. Herald.
“The horseleech hath two daughters”—
singing all day long:
Give! Give! Give! is the burthen of their
song;
Solomon, who heard them, tells us this is
so;
But they were modest persons to some we
know!
Solomon, the Wise Man, knew an awful
lot,
Used to furnish wisdom right upon the spot;
Knew both men and women, and their little
ways—
But never met the cadgers we have nowa-
days !
When the Shechem Council, anxious for a
loan —
Say, to build a goat-pound—waited on the
Throne:
“Daughters of the Horseleech!” Solomon
would say—
“lf we do it for you, how much can you
pan?”
Then the Shechem Council vowed and raved
and si; ore,
By their fathers’ whiskers, they were very
poor!
Still, he was a great King, and —they were
content
To repay his Treasurer, plus ten per cent!
Whereupon the Great King sweetly smiled
and said :
“See to it, O Treasurer —upon thy head !
Make it known in Israel, while \Ve live,
Those who often seek boons must some-
times give!”
If you doubt the story—as, of course, you
may—
Recollect the maxim— Someone has to pay-
How do you imagine Sol. kept up his
Throne,
If, at times, he didn’t charge Shechem for
its loan?
As it was in Salem, so it is to-day;
Even in Australia, someone has to pay!
When the cadger Council for “special
grants,”
The Little Boy at Manly has to pawn his
pants!
Let our busy Beebys take a little leaf
From the Book of Solomon —’twill save
them grief!
To our cadging Councils let them gently
say:
“Daughters of th n Horseleech ! How much
ran you pay?”

Wanted, an Export Duty on Fire Insurance
Offices.
In days gone by, England built up its wool-
len industry by prohibiting the export of
wool; quite unlike Australia, which tries to
build up the Japanese woollen industry by
giving a bonus on the export of partially
prepared wool, so that the foreigner may get
the stuff more cheaply than the Australian
manufacturer does. South Africa boosts up
its ostrich-feather industry by prohibiting,
under enormous penalties, the export of
ostriches. This country badly wants a Gov-
ernment which will prohibit the export of
stud sheep, crude ores and fire insurance
offices. The latest thing in the fire insurance
line is the proposed sale of the business of
the old Derwent and Tamar Co., of Tas-
mania, to the London and Lancashire office
of England.' If the transaction comes off, it
will leave Tasmania with the very smallest
fire office of the Commonwealth as its sole
remaining asset in this line of business. The
little isle has a wonderful a-nd abiding faith
in the absentee, and believes cordially in sell-
ing him all its assets and paying him tribute
in the shape of interest, profits and rents for
ever. It must be admitted that the other
States have done a good deal in this line also,
but they realise the danger, which, appar-
ently, Tasmania doesn’t, and they aren’t
proud of their absentee, which Tasmania
apparently is. Moreover, though they have
sold a good few fire insurance concerns to
the foreigner, they have started a few new
ones to partially fill the gap, whereas Tas-
mania never starts anything new these days.
So Tassy is the State which has enjoyed, in
proportion to its population, the biggest in-
rush of foreign capital. And it is, as a
natural consequence, the poorest and most
backward and most hopeless member of the
Australian brotherhood, despite the fact that
it has the best chances and the best natural
endowments. Of course, it will get a certain
price if it sells out the assets and goodwill
of almost the last big financial institution
that is left to it, though it seems to be sell-
ing at a wretchedly poor price. But
even if it got a good price it also
sells the possibilities of the future, and
in a country with so much room for new
population they are immense for any office
with a good reputation .(which the Derwent
and Tamar has) and enterprising manage-
ment (which it hasn’t). With its re-
putation, enterprising management might
have made it 10 times its present
size. Australia and Tasmania could
have sold all their fire insurance con-
nections about 50 years ago for probably
50 per cent, more than their then paper value,
and spent the money on drink or wild cats,
but when the vast expansion of the business
is considered, it is evident they would have
made a rotten bargain. Tasmania certainly
has become a less and less important mem-
ber of the group, as it went more and more
out of the job of being its own financier.
The money it got for jobbing away its fin-
ancial institutions to outsiders has appar-
ently drifted away from it, just like the
money which Charles Surface got when
he also sold the family estate. Australia
wants a heavy absentee tax on outside in-
surance offices which do business within
its borders; and a law to absolutely pro-
hibit the sale of the assets and goodwill of
any Australian insurance company to out-
side capitalists. Also, a Government fire
office wouldn’t be amiss. It could at least
be guaranteed to remain Australian all the
time.
o
So far as any normal human being can judge,
the wearisome uproar concerning the tempor-
ary site of the Naval College is at an end. Gee-
long (Vic.) was well up in the betting at
one time. Its strong suit was the posses-
sion of Osborne House, a vast edifice capable
of housing all our embryo mariners, and a
few over. Greenwell Point, which is on
the Shoalhaven River, near Coolangatta,
was seriously considered by Captain Cham-
bers, the Government’s adviser. And about
420 other sites clamored insistently for re-
cognition. The selection that was finally
made last week, namely Captain’s Point, at
Jervis Bay, seems about as good as any that
was practicable. There is plenty of water
adjacent, fresh and otherwise; the air and
scenery are unimpeachable, and the students
will not be distracted by the festive tripper
who is so out of place in a scholastic en-
vironment. The only conceivable hitch is
the unwillingness of the N. S. Wales Govern-
ment to link up Bomaderry and Jervis Bay
by means of a railway. It is a dreary fact
that the McGowen Ministry is just as
much the slave of Sydney vested interests
as any of its predecessors were. Sydney has
always fought strenuously against anything
tending to benefit rival ports, such as Jervis
Bay, and it may be relied on to continue do-
ing so. If the inevitable movement suc-
ceeds the whole futile, unprofitable business
of tearing about, searching for sites, will
start once more. If it doesn’t, N. S. Wales
will have gained in at least two ways: it
will have had an awkward question settled in
as satisfactory a way as was possible in the
circumstances, and it will have made a
feeble, tentative sort of move in the direc-
tion of decentralisation.
♦
This is the State Premiers’ day for clamor-
ing about their special “right” to the use of
the savings of the Australian people, as
against the Federal Government’s equally
good “right,” and it is their time
for quite ignoring any claim the
people, who own the savings, may
have to be consulted in the matter. Still,
the case for the people—the depositors—
might be considered. The State Premiers
have three reasons, or sets of reasons, for
hanging on to the Savings Banks: (1)
Meanness, quarrelsomeness and hatred of
the Australian Government because it is
Australian; (2) a wild idea of their own
importance; (o) the fact that the State
Savings Banks are a means whereby they get
cheap and fairly-abundant loan funds. The
people put their money into the Savings
Banks because they are regarded as safe
institutions. The State Government’s
annex a great deal of the money at rates
fixed by themselves. It is quite probable
that the management could often make big-
ger profits for its clients, the depositors, if it
went into the open market and bought up
such existing securities (of any Australian
State) as might chance to be offering, in-
stead of taking new securities from the local
State Government at par, but this is a view
of the case which apparently doesn’t appeal
to the State insects. One of the bitterest
objections which they offer to the transfer
of the savings bank business to the Com-
monwealth is that, under Federal manage-
ment, the money of one State might some-
times be invested in the securities of an-
other. Why should it not be so invested if
it happened at the moment that the return
was better? Surely the depositors should
have a look in now and then. The fixed
opinion of the State Premiers appears to
be: (1) That the people have no right to
transfer their Savings Bank business to their
own Australian Government if the State
Premiers object; (2) that they have no
right to even say whether they want to
transfer it or not, unless the State Premiers
are willing; (3) that they have no right
to get the highest interest they can, but
should take whatever figure the State Pre-
miers choose to borrow their money at. In
fact, Denham and McGowen and Murray
and Verran don’t seem quite sure that the
people have any rights at all.

Here beginneth the weary weekly task of
saying that “The Quaker Girl” continues to
be a tuneful success at Her Majesty’s, Syd-
ney. The writer rpakes the full and frank
confession that he hasn’t seen it for 10
days, and doesn’f know a thing more about
it than he did 10 days ago; but the impetus
which it got at the start may be relied upon
with perfect safety to take it along for
weeks. Meantime, he recalls that he didn’t
previously mention that Bantock makes a
really picturesque Quaker; that Mrs.
George Lauri is back on the programme,
keeping the pub where the runaway couple
do the cooing while the landlady does the
billing; that once more Miss Nellie Wilson
is a bad, bold actress (why are actresses
always asked to represent actresses as bad,
bold hussies?) ; that Miss Galvin is a very
acid Aunt Rachel, of the (Quaker persua-
sion ; and that Board and Little have
painted some scenery much better than Na-
ture does it as a rule.
“A Woman of No Importance,” now resid-
ing at the Palace, under Plimmer-Denniston
management, is, theatrically speaking, a per-
son of great charm and considerable import-
ance. It is the sort of play and company
that the discerning play-lover says farewell
to with sincere regret. In the meantime, he
goes along as numerously as possible, and
hoards up pleasant recollections against the
long, lean months when the theatrical ban-
queting board will be bare save for a little
cold tripe and chestnuts.

Ike and Will Scott got back to the Tivoli,
on Saturday, after an absence of four years.
Their business is foolery and stepping; the
foolery is smart and the stepping is light.
The boyish Du Foy Trio of dancers also
came back, on Saturday, for a short season.
Artist Bert Levy is due to depart on Friday;
but the names of Cakewalk Johnson, Pastor
and Merle, Tom Dawson and Fanny Powers
still lend enchantment to the bill. Herbert
a comedian from England, will endea-
vor to bring down the house for the first
time this (Thursday) evening.
The few careless individuals who have
missed seeing the other side of Ethel Irv-
ing’s art —the tempestuous, cyclonic side —
as expounded in “Dame Nature,” at the
Criterion, are hereby warned that the storm
centre will not remain longer in Sydney
than Saturday week. After that, Ethel
Irving will take her* finished art back to
dissipate the fogs of her own land; _ and
modern light comedy, as far as Australia is
concerned, will be but a remembersome
memory in an arid waste of “Quaker Girls”
and “Cingalees.”
“The Girl in the Train” ends her long,
cheery and profitable journey on Friday
night next. She has been over two months
travelling from the front door of the Cri-
terion to the back aperture of the Royal;
and it is something of a tribute to her
charm that she has not bored a soul during
the trip. That well and favorably known
old chestnut, “The Cingalee,” succeeds her
on Saturday night, at the usual hour and
prices.

Alick is exhibiting his aft 12,000 miles from

The Greater J. D. picture
people cover a range of sub-
jects at their three Sydney houses, and the
compilation of six distinct programmes a
week must call for some huqtling —it means
anything from 35 to 50 items. The Lyric
has been showing two absorbingly interest- 1
ing films, one picturing aeroplanes and the-
other torpedo-boat firing. Now, on the
change of programme, the humorous side is
uppermost, as it also is at (he, Colonial No.
1. Colonial No. 2 has had a good indus-
trial .film, “Cotton-weaving.”. “Artistic
Earthenware” now takes its< place. But
the educational picture seems tp occur less
frequently than it used to. The bulk of the
programmes these times consists of come-
dies and melodramas —pretty “cheap” stuff
mostly.
Parsons and otherwise are reminded that
“A Girl’s Temptations” will remain at the
Adelphi for another week. Although a
Salv’army ballet beseeching the house to
“Yield Not to Temptation” would be a wel-
come addition, what there is of it is real
24-carat melodrama and worth while.

The Exhibition Building, in Prince Alfred
Park (Sydney), is being swept and gar-
nished, prior to receiving the inhabitants
of Tiny Town as its guests. They will be
at home there to the general public twice a
day from February 3. Ladies who attend
are requested not to knock over the Tiny
Town post-office with their skirts, and any-
body who puts the 30in. Gaud Mayor in his
pocket will be prosecuted with the utmost
fury of the law.
The foregoing reads like a charitable
notice of that old-established outrage, “The
World Against Her/’ now dragging its
loose-jointed narrative around the stage of
the King’s (Melb.) for 12 nights only. Per-
haps the most conspicuous crudity of a terri-
bly popular attraction is that its two princi-
pal events are both due to the drapery and
millinery trade. When woeful Ned Duggan
is required to meet his lost daughter by
accident, or Miss Duggan needs to be brought
face to face with the husband, who cast > her
off, they are sent out with drapery parcels
to deliver at the respective domiciles of their
kith and kin, and thus the long arm . of coin-
cidence pushes them, a» it were, into the
way of reconciliation.
The Plying Ballet, the tricky Sleeds, the
Shipwreck, together with all the other fea-
tures of “Sinbad,” are repeated eight times
a week at Her Majesty’s (Melbourne), as
before. Last week thg principal girl (Nell
Pinnis) was invalided/and her part fell to a
pretty understudy, who wanted only a fuller
sense of self-sufficiency to make her a com-
plete success. The Dame (Pip Powell) is
still going strong; her new qnd tuneful hus-
band, Howard, has shaken down into his
place; Drew and Alders perpetrate their in-
genious mechanical jokes without fail; the
Emperor of Sahara has not ceased to be less
funny than he might be ; and Celia Ghiloni
still persists in looking handsome, although
the panto, indicates that ugliness is expected
of her. And everything in the garden of
girlhood is lovely.
Life at Cripple Creek, made up of ex-
cursions and alarms, with amorous and alco-
holic interludes, is still being vividly and
vociferously represented at the Princess’s.
The buxom hero exudes moral claptraptious-
ness with the fervor of an indignant jelly-
fish : the villain-in-chief displays a criminal
energy, which is wasted on account of its
alliance with Colossal incapacity; the fun-
ereal “Injun” wins sympathy by intoning
the narrative of his lost love; the reformed
Dynamite Ann keeps off fermented and
spirituous liquors ; and Ben White, the nig-
ger, wanders about like a fugitive from a
variety show. For the rest, the show at the
Princess’s is mostly revolvers and female
screams. It includes all the elementsof cow-
boy picture-drama except wild horses.
In “Leaves of Romance,” at the Prahran
Lyric (Vic.) last week, the audience got its
favorite dish of cowboy with his cowgirl
thrown in. The hero of the film was a.
buckskin Apollo called Bud or something,
and he raised loud cheers by eloping with a
lady who had gone quite “potty” on his
handsome eyes and the flaxen curls on his
noble brow. A picture that was almost
equally cheered was “The Train Des-
patcher,” in which a crippled kid and a
forlorn young female figured with tearful
results. Of more than average merit was a
scenic subject, showing some views of Trieste
Harbor and its vicinity, including the beau-
tiful Castle of Miramar, where Maxi-

STECK
One of the World’s
Great PIANOS.
EXTRACT, taken from the Life of Robert Schumann,
By VOV WASIKLEWSKI, Page 12.
“The greatest, ecstasy was caused by the arrival of
a Grand Piano, in Schumann’s house, made by the
celebrated STECK, from Vienna.”
Every STECK Piano manufactured is a perfect in-
strument. The world’s leading musicians said so
50 years ago—they still say so to-day. The STECK
does not rely solely on a reputation made in the
past, it relies mainly on its present musical excel-
lence. Its purity of tone and easy responsiveness of
action are a revelation to prospective piano pur-
chasers, who immediately recognise the STECK as
an instrument of altogether exceptional merit.
THESE PIANOS CAN BE HAD FOR CASH

Clarke and Mostol. who returned to the
Opera House for a short farewell season
on Saturday, shuffle their feet to the com-
plete satisfaction of the gallery, which is
the real connoisseur in this branch ot the
fine arts. Wilson Hallett’s mimicry of
kiddies is clever and artistic ; also most ot
his stories are amusing, and some ot them
are new. The last nights are announced of
Hanvarr and Lee and Fred Bluett; but no
hope is yet held out of the early departure
of Miss Alice Raymond and “A Night in
Egypt.” The gaudy staging and cheap pre-
tentiousness of this turn invite a disrespect
which is not dispelled by the manner jn
which a march from “Aida” and the Pil-
grims’ Chorus from “Tannhauser are ren-
dered by the lady and her fellow instrumen-

tram-line to her dear old home. There is one

which might be dropped into the panto, when
the allegorical play is withdrawn from
disputation.
Quite a number of the daily paper obitu-
aries of Henry Labouchere, proprietor of
London Truth, who passed out last week,
at the age of 81, remark that “he always
declined office.” Labouchere entered the
British House of Commons in IS6G, and
stayed till old age climbed on his shoulders.
He was a brilliant writer, a brilliant
speaker and a courageous exposer of shams,
frauds and thieves —-in short, he was so far
above the ruck that it was regarded as the
right thing to say that he always declined
office in order to explain why he never got
it. As a matter of fact, he had as much
ambition as any other M.P., and Gladstone
once included him in the scheme of a new
Ministry. But Queen Victoria loathed bril-
liance and originality, and had no use for
anybody who threw bricks at the conven-
tional shams of our civilisation. So
Labouchere was barred, and probably some
dull old beer-prig with a purchased title got
the portfolio that should have been his.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Edith Crane, whose death is reported f roin
America, though not a gifted actress, made a strik-
ingly realistic Trilby. An intelligent artist enough,
with the necessary stage experience, Miss Crane had
the right face and figure for the part, ana equally
important—the right voice. A strong voice, neither
harsh nor shrill nor husky, but distinctly taulty in
its intonation. The tone-deafness of Du Maurier s
Trilby was suggested as soon as the actress opened
her mouth. She had no music in her speech, hence her
impersonation of a Trilby who couldn’t sing a note
save when Svengali hypnotised her, was as nearly
convincing as the theatrical character of the 1 1 lay
would permit. And the play had some memorable
moments of silent theatrical effect. The changing
picture of the dumb group in the studio, sentimen-
talising under the spell of Svengali’s music, was a
finely arranged scene. People unconsciously leaned
forward to watch the mimic effect of the music on
the three men and the girl they loved Miss Crane
being the girl. Trilby was the only part she played
during her first visit to Australia in 1896. When
she returned some years later, with Tyrone Power,
and was starred as an emotional actress in three or
four characters, her Trilby was still the best of them,
although it had grown older. Tyrone Power and his
wife ended their visit disastrously by going into man-
agement at Melbourne Princess’s and getting out with
a heavy deficit.
“Dog’s Body”: John McCormack has been telling
us, in Maoriland, some- .cheerful things about Aus-
tralian (he called them “Colonial”) audiences.
“Absolutely,” says Mac.-, “I have no cause for com-
plaint in ' regard to the appreciation that colonial
audiences give to what might be called the better
class of music. I have found an educated apprecia-
tion and a critical faculty that one scarcely ex-
pected to discover in so young a country.... I en-
joyed very much singing to the Sydney and Mel-
bourne audiences —especially the Melbourne people.”
Incidentally, McCormack seems to put the pot on the
much-labored story that the recent opera season in
Australia was a gift from Melba to her home
land. He was asked if he thought it was a paying
proposition for artists who have the highest engage-
ments in the world at their command, to pay Aus-
tralasia an occasional visit. “Well,” he said,
“Melba is scarcely a philanthropist, and she has
been out more than once.”
“0.K.”: “An actors’ union, affiliated with the
Trades Hall” doesn’t strike the ear as a very har-
monious band ; and close union between various
grades of mummers, who are mostly hankering for
somebody else’s job, seems out of the question. Mum-
mers are always looking for limelight rather than fair
industrial conditions —friend Greasepaint would rather
star in the arduous role of Hamlet for £l2 a week
than walk through the part of Horatio for £l5.
The most that can be expected of mummer unionism
is a whole-hearted demand for a minimum wage from
those managements which run big businesses on regu-
lar commercial lines. And the dignity of the purfesh
demands that much unionism at least; for the more
that a manager has to pay to the stage footman or
parlor-maid who carries a tray and speaks only a
dozen words in all, the more he will trouble himself
to select Jhe brightest stage-struck novices obtainable.
“Harrison O.”': Though I had seen Ethel Irving
many times at the Melbourne Royal, I scarcely recog-
nised her when I heard her in “Dame Nature” at
Sydney Criterion —which emphasised the fact that
there is not an available theatre in Melbourne suit-
able for the display of an art such as Miss Irving’s.
Many fine points must be missed in a house like the
Royal, formerly sacred to the delicately-modulated
histrionics of the Blandolt and Bilandersonian schools.
In the Cri., with its cosy dress-circle close to the
stage and its general structural compactness, the
actress is able to get into touch with her audience
in a wav she could not hope to do in any Yarraside
playhouse. No wonder “the firm” realises Mel-
bourne’s need of a small theatre, and intends erecting
one in Russell-street, opposite the King’s.
George Edwardes, of London Gaiety and Daly’s,
and inventor of musical comedy, from whom J. C.
Williamson purchases most of the sprightly Com-
modities he places before Australian playgoers, has
been entertained at a banquet, by way of celebrating
his 25th year of continuous management. In eulo-
gising him, Beerbolim Tree, the chairman, referred to
his great services to the nation, in “infusing a good
deal of new blood into the peerage.”
Florence Imeson’s name is, seemingly, Simeon, with
the first letter put in the fourth place. Anyhow,
the little lady is very palpably Jewish.
The animal “trainer” has been getting some more
limelight on his risks. This time the trouble was at
Wirths’ Circus, which is touring Maoriland, and it
happened during the big thrill in which the lion,
lioness, dog, goat, bear, man, and other wild animals
are locked in the iron enclosure. The lions had been
sent up on their pedestals, and the trainer, raising
the grizzly to his hind hoofs, proceeded to promenade
him. Thereabouts, the hairy pug. swung Iris dirty
left, downed his man, and commenced lunch to the
accompaniment of shrieks, shouts, curses, pitchforks,
tent-pegs, hysterics and Ancient Henry. The proceed-
ings were only one degree worse than the “Liberals”
attacking Speaker Willis in the N. S. Wales Assem-
bly, by reason of the fact than the snarling lions
kept the police from interfering. Fortunately, they
took no further part in the argument, not even when
one Mclnnes entered the enclosure with a sizable
hunk of gas-pipe, and induced the bear to listen to
reason. The trainer was then dragged out and carted
to the hospital. He was not dangerously wounded ;
but the Wirths, reckoning that things might not end
so satisfactorily on the next occasion, took the bear
by the forelock, and made a present of him to the
Wellington Zoo.
One Alexander Galley, who is something in the way
of being a big hat in vaudeville business in England,
has been passing a few opinions concerning
the cinematograph business in England. Galley
admits promptly that the moving picture boom
hit the music-hall where it resided, but he
reckons that the picture craze is on the slump. The
music-hall, or variety theatre, he declares with his
hand upon his reputation, is coming back to its own,
and he desires to be informed how his statement can
be doubted, when a hall offers on its programme
much of the cream of the world’s stage talent. Says
Galley: “It has been a staggerer to the theatrical
world' during the past few years to witness the num-
ber of ‘top-liners’ that have come over to vaudeville.
In one music-hall sketch (say) of 20 minutes,
they can earn more money than for an all-night per-
formance at the theatres.” Galley’s opinion is that
vaudeville will not only entirely recover from the set-
back given it by the picture-show, but will presently
become more popular in Britain than it ever was
before.
Oscar Hammerstein’s new Opera House in Kings-
way, London, seems a comfortable sort of crib. It is
absolutely stiff with lounge- and cloak- and refresh-
ment-rooms ; and, as a further antidote to the sing-
ing, has a delightful roof-garden, where the best of
drinks and so forth are obtainable at corresponding
prices. It also has a “wireless” office, through which
customers at sea can book their seats and send notes
and messages to their friends. There is accommo-
dation for the same number of people, roughly, as in-
habit Mudgee (N.S.W.). The stalls and two galleries
absorb 2300, the rest beng distributed over the 53
proscenium and grand tier boxes and the considerable
acreage available for standing room. Special innova-
tions are the private entrances, one of which is re-
served for Queen Alexandra, while another is kept for
London’s Gaud Mayor. The vast place cost £200,000,
but as an Americanised German Jew is running it,
it should get back all that and a bit over.
“Lud”: A feature of the late Henry Labouchere’s
variegated career that does not seem to have been
touched on in the local papers was his connection
with the stage. After he retired from, or was fired
out of, the profession of diplomacy, he married Hen-
rietta Hodson, an actress, and went into management
at. the Queen’s Theatre, London. He had a good eye
for acting-talent, and engaged a number of mummers
who were “on the rise,” and destined to make names
for themselves, among them being Irving, George
Rignold, Lai Brough and Charles ’VVyndham. Toole
was also one of his employees, though that comedian
had already made good when Labby booked him.
Irving came to Labby from the Princess’s, where,
with Miss Herbert’s management, he had done well
as Doricourt in “The Belle’s Stratagem..” He was en-
gaged there on Boucicault’s recommendation, after
his Bawdon Scudamore in Boucicault’s “Hunted
Down,” at Manchester. Transferring to Labouchere’s
Queen’s, nominally under the Hodson, he won the
high praise of Dickens as Sikes. He acted at the
Queen’s for the first time with Ellen Terry. This was
in “Katharine and Petruchio.” She got twice his
salary or more. Byron’s plays of “Dearer Than Life”
and “Uncle Dick’s Darling,” lifted him somewhat.
He went to the Vaudeville, for his Digby Grand, in
“The Two Roses.” Meanwhile George Rignold ad-
vanced to leading man at the Queen’s, with a par-
ticular hit as Caliban. Irving changed again to the
Lyceum, where his Landry, in “Fanchon,” did not
give satisfaction. Manager Bateman wanted to re-
place him with Rignold, but Rignold declined, on the
advice of Jack Ryder. About this time Labouchere
became an M.P., and dropped the stage for good.
An absolutely inexplicable bit of recent cable
news was the announcement of the death of a mum-
mer named Jacob Strennet, in a Toronto lodging-
house. Described as a “friend of Edwin Booth, and
a co-aetor with Sir Henry Irving,” he may have
been anything from a cheap, low comedy man to
a lugubrious ghost in “Hamlet.” Who was Jacob
Strennet, anyhow? The statement that “he retired
from the English stage in 1889, when threatened
with blindness,” merely intensifies the mystery.
Frank Talbot, back from S’Africa, where he acted
as the Taits’ advance agent for Clara Butt, gives
figures to prove that Capetown is the best city of its
size on earth for “star” concert business. The Butt-
Rumford Co., with Nevin Tait in charge, gave 29
concerts in nine towns. Johannesburg, which has
100,000 whites, was good for nine concerts, but Cape-
town, with only 31,000 whites, swallowed the bait
four times at the outset of the tour, and another
three times (at reduced prices), before Clara left for
England. The Town Hall at Capetown seats 2000
people, and was rushed every time, the prices for the
first season being a guinea, half-guinea and five
“bob.” The Butt programme was much the same as
in Australia, and, strange to say, although S’Africa is
growing more Dutch, and the Taal is supplanting
English in all official directions, audiences everywhere
went wild over the Jingoistic hymn, “Land of Hope
and Glory.” The Mayor of Johannesburg wanted to
engage Clara Butt to sing it at a big municipal ban-
quet, where the Fat men of both nationalities were
to meet for the purpose of clearing the air of all
racial animosities. But the “loyal” corporation wasn’t
prepared to Supply more than half of the fee which
the Taits would have had to pay Clara, and their
“loyhlty” didn’t run to the idea of standing the dif-
ference in order that the lady might sing outside of
their concerts, and her “loyalty” wasn’t reckoned
equal to the strain of warbling at bargain prices. So
the rival Fat men never got the opportunity to be-
come united by silken bonds of song, as it were. An
actor who greatly impressed Talbot in Africa was
Henry Herbert, touring with a co. in Shakspearian
plays. Herbert, he says, is a fine performer and
wonderfully versatile. In one week, with two mati-
nees, he played King Lear, Malvolio, Julius Caesar,
Caliban (in “The Tempest”), Macbeth, Bottom the
Weaver, and Hamlet (twice on the Saturday). Her-
bert, like Asche, graduated in Benson’s school of
poetic drama, and knows his business from A to Z.
Moreover, his talent for all sorts of Shakspearian im-
personations extends to something very like genius
for two or three of them.
“D.” : For sheer unoriginality, conservatism, loath-
ing of change, and so forth, the music-hall pro. is
surely unsurpassed. At a Sydney vaudeville show,
just now, the management is starring one Cavalieri,
a quick-change artist. Fifteen years ago I saw my
first quick-change expert, and his name was Fregoli.
Fregoli made his initial bow in a blue silk knicker-
bocker suit, black stockings, a garishly painted face,
an upstanding lock of hair, and other bizarre appur-
tenances. I identified every one of them in Cava-
lieri last week. The Hebrew monologuist has worn
immense flat boots, a frock coat and a bowler hat,
pressed well down over the ears, since the beginning
of time. Then there are the perpetrators of coon
songs, “refined ballads,” soubrette turns, acrobatic
acts, etc., all of whom have a time-worn livery, and
stick to it like glue. The original comic singer of
vaudeville was, so delvers into history tell me, a poor
man. In fact, he had to appear in rags or in the
nude. His nose was crimson—partly from drink,
partly from the cold, which he had not the means to
ward off. Ever since, the comedian of the music-hall
stage has been a forlorn, tattered, red-nosed outcast,
and it seems that he will continue to be so till the
end. One advantage, and one only, the conservatism
of the vaudeville artist brings to the public. It may
be compared to the R.C. Church’s immemorial prac-
tice of having all its services, the world over, in the
Latin tongue. The vaudeville patron is never at a
loss, or afflicted with a feeling of strangeness in a new
hall. Everything is as it was in the establishment
he visited a week or so previously ; in fact, all is as
it was in the halls he visited in earliest youth.
“Propstick”: Apropos Maria Mortimer, the old
time Melbourne actress (B. 28/12/’ll). When I wai
less than 20, I was recognised as a stop-gap ole
man actor. Failing a Jimmy Milne, a Musgrave, oi
a Con Warde, not to speak of a Rogers or Lambert
they would drop on your humble dust. “All tha
Glitters is not Gold” was put up, with me as Jaspe:
Plum, and my opposite was Miss Mortimer, as Ladi
Lethbridge, called Leatherbreeches by Toby Twinkle
We had onlv one rehearsal. Miss Mortimer was evi
dentlv in bad health, so at night I found mysel;
acting with good old Mother Avins, who had had nc
rehearsal at all. The last I saw of poor Maria Mor-
timer, she was serving in a booth at the Melbourne
races. , „ ...... ,
The Asches, who leave London for Australia early
next month, are going to put in a fortnight’s rest at
Colombo by the way. Their hopes of another good
Australian time are somewhat tinged, with regret that
this visit couldn’t be postponed for a year at least.
The tremendous success of “Kismet” was not foreseen.
Two years ago Oscar and his pretty spouse left Bri-
tain to better themselves, but this time they are m
the thick of prosperity, and have nothing to gain by
shifting camp.
“C. Ockney”: Re-enter Charles Haddon Chambers,
It is long since we have seen a play of his.
In his “Passers-by,” described as a “comedy-drama,”
there are only seven adult characters, and one cheeild.
Haddon is fond of the short cast. His “Tyranny
of Tears” had only six speaking parts. When done
in London, “Passers-by” was a good ad. for Aus-
tralia, because the Australian author selected an
Australian actor for the comedy-character part—-O.
P. Ileggie, to wit —and the mummer justified his
selection by getting great kudos for a clever perform-
ance. George Shelton, who was in these latitudes
with the J. L. Toole co., also appeared in the
London production ; and Chambers’s old friend, “the
long arm of coincidence,” held a hand in the
business.
Until his “Passers-by” was put on the bills,
Charles Haddon Chambers had been played so little
in Australia of late that the theatre Suffer and the
young male friend who buys chocolates for her,
scarcely know that he is Australian. Chambers’s
father was in the N.S.W. Lands Department, and
the youngster who wrote “The Tyranny of Tears”
got his schooling at Fort-street, in Sydney.
Wellington (M.L.) is the only place in Austral-
asia where the local council refuses to issue a license
to a circus until an insurance policy has been taken
out to cover accident to the public. Wirth Bros.’
big show struck the place the other day, and was
called upon to take out a £lOOO policy, at a cost
of £2O for a week.
The portrait of Melba, which Australian
artist Florence Rodway recently produced,
has been hung in the National Art Gallery
at Sydney, where it will remain as a per-
manent reminder of the idealised songstress.

At least one person in Melbourne has a
heart-racking reason for asking information
re the fate of the tiny Pandora yawl, which
sailed from Australia 18 months ago, with
Captains Blythe and Arapakis aboard. The
mariners navigated their little craft to
N’York, and left there on July 20 last year.
Nothing, seemingly, has been heard of them
or the Pandora since, though a Sydney paper
is said to have published a rumor that the
craft was “wrecked off Madeira.” Can any-
body throw a ray of hope on the situation?
From S. M. Herald (19/1/T2) :
We used to see advertisements in the papers, “Mar-
ried couple wanted ; no encumbrance.” And it would
seem that married couples without encumbrance are
still preferred. Is Australia, then, to become another
France, even while yet its population is so small ?
Who would think, to read those fine, ringing
words, that the Herald has been banking
the proceeds of “no encumbrance” advts.
almost since it first began to own a cheque-
book? The first thing for a sturdy, reform-
ing paper to do is to raise the price of the
“no encumbrance” advt. to £7OO an inch.

One of the annoyances of Ivew (Mel-
bourne) lunatic asylum is the reckless way
in which patients break their ribs. No
less than four have recently been discovered
with broken ribs. One, who died a few days
ago, was found to be suffering from bed-
sores on both hips, abrasions on hands and
legs, and the usual and frequent rib break-
ages. A theory advanced by way of ex-
planation is that the ribs of lunatics are
very brittle. Doubtless this is quite cor-
rect, for it is well known that, if you look
too hard sideways at the middle part of a
lunatic, or blow on him vigorously, he is
liable to suffer damage. In fact, there are
records of a lunatic having been blown in
two. In the old, bad days of England, it
was the custom to suppress the angry,
obstreperous or fizzy variety of madman by
tying him down on a bed, after which a
warder walked up and down his chest on his
knees. This was liable to break his ribs, or
even his brea.st-bone, without leaving any
outward evidence, for even in those days
lunatics were a brittle lot. When the
warders learned this they abandoned the
practice, which had only been adopted with
a mistaken idea of amusing the patients and
preventing time hanging heavily on their
hands. Nowadays, patients mostly break
their own ribs, by hitting themselves on
the stomach with a cruet-stand, or some
such device.
Victoria’s Department of Agriculture has
been indulging in a one-sided argument with
the Bailway Department over a matter of
bees. It appears that the bee expert shipped
several hives of the birds from Tooborac to
Glenorchy, and the railway people wanted
to charge £l2 Bs. for the job. They said
this was at t*he usual rate for lots under
three tons, but the bee man said the insects
weren’t worth that much, and he would
rather forfeit the goods than pay. Not only
that, but he claimed that the hives had
been bumped in transit —which seems pos-
sible—and that some of the contents had
got lost, while others had been forced to
“whip behind,” and had become fatigued
and unfit for use in the dairy, or wherever
bees are used. The railway bosses
perceived that they had no earthly
hope of raising £l2 Bs. on a few
bees, and they couldn’t save them up
for a good market, because labor is already
scarce in the department, and it was no good
putting them in the cold stores, because the
manager advised that there was no market
for frozen bees in England. So the depart-
ment compromised at £9 Bs., and left one on
the counter for ithe expert.

“Belaying Pin’s” hard mozzle:—
I notice by meagre paragraphs in the press that
Justice Higgins has thrown out the case of the
Merchant Service Guild v. inter state shipowners, on
the ground that there is already in existence an
award which he could not vary. That may be so ;
but to me, one of those who suffer from its wording,
there appears something wrong when a bad award s
patent anomalies cannot be righted. As things are, a
shipowner can allot an officer a “home port” whicli
his ship seldom or never visits, and which, if it visits
at all, it leaves after a few hours’ stay. Take my
ship as an instance. On signing articles a year ago,
I was allotted (we’ll say) Port Pirie. I protested;
the ship never went there—-or, at most, did so only
once or twice a year. The other officers were given
other ports. One of them got Melbourne; and dur-
ing the past 12 months that officer has had 84 clear
days away from the ship and all responsibilities,
whilst I, whose wife and family reside in Melbourne,
have never had one day, apart from my annual
leave. Further, if the vessel did go to my “home port,”
and arrived (we’ll say) on Sunday or Saturday, I would
have to spend my eight hours on board. It is good
to see Jack and the firemen going ashore at five
o’clock on the day of arrival, and feel that a fool
award will not allow me to go until the completion
of eight hours after arrival. An officer could take
his midnight to 4 a.m. and noon to 4 p.m. watches
at sea, and, arriving at five, still be liable for duty
until midnight without payment of overtime. I feel
sure Justice Higgins never intended that a man
should spend Sundays and holidays on board in the
port where his home was, or that one man should
have 84 days off in one year and another not one, or
that any man could be liable for duty for more than
eight hours any day except under exceptional circum-
stances.

It is “generally understood in church
circles,” according to the daily press, that
another parson is to be imported from Eng-
land for an important billet in the diocese
of Sydney. There are just two more things
left for the Anglican Church to import—
the congregation and the collection. It is
up to all good Australians to make a note
of this fact.
THE SONG OF SOLOMON.
The blather of faith healers, Theosopliists
and numerous other misty sectarians of the
liighah culchaw class amounts to luminous
logic compared with the cackle of Latter-
Day Saints. Notoriety hath no charms for
the Saints, neverthe-
less their long-haired
canvassers are found
scattering printed
matter in the rural
highways and byways
of the Common-
wealth. The indefi-
niteness of Latter
Day doctrines was
drawn, seemingly,
from a maze of Scrip-
tural quotations, the
concoction being de-
scribed as Bays of
Light, Glad Tidings
of Great Joy, etc.,
etc. It is charged
with orthodox Iver-
ristian spirit, for al-
though brimstone is
not mentioned, brim-
stone can be smelt
between the lines of
the- pamphlets. Un-
less ye believe ye
perish. Salvation is
obtainable only
through the ministra-
tions of them who
cheat the barber.
This news item of
great joy, “start-
ling, though it may
appear, is the eter-
nal truth which will
stand the test of
both reason and rev-
elation,” A man
never knows for cer-
tain what will happen
to his soul tintil he
has swallowed the tid-
ings that his melan-
choly, unbarbered
brother Melchisedec
drops over the back fence. Then he knoweth
that, not having been born to recognise the
early priesthood of Aaron in the knowledge
of the Holy Ghost and the unity of the faith,
and being, moreover, the victim of a baptism
which is void in the sight of Heaven, and-
therefore, worse than useless, he was born
to be damned. The cry of the uncut hairy-
man is the oddest message of damnation
ever forwarded to this office.

Already Wowsers in England and the
United States are making a crusade against

“Adelaide”: Someone ought to speak to
Conan Doyle. In his latest Sherlock Holmes
story he has a criminal identified by a torn
ear. It is “Holy Peters, one of the most
unscrupulous rascals that Australia has ever
evolved —and for a young country it has
turned out some very finished types.” And
the ear? It was “badly bitten in a saloon
fight at Adelaide in ’89.” One can see this
town as the author imagines it: the fierce
cowboys riding their unbroken wallabies in
from their ranches at Kent Town and Bow-
den, letting off their six-shooters all along
King William-street, foregathering in the
gambling-hells with which that thorough-
fare is lined, and scattering the gold-dust
acquired without trouble on the banks of the
Patawalonga. For recreation, they roll on
sawdusted saloon floors, and gouge and bite.
That is how Conan Doyle no doubt pictures
it. The reality is different. There certainly
were plenty of Holy Peters here in 1889, and
are still; but they bite your ear with a col-
lection plate, and leave a hole in your
pocket.

“Martha”:—
The S. M. Herald published an article, last Fri-
day, headed: —
BAN OF MOTHERHOOD.
SERIOUS PROBLEM.
CHILDREN, OR IMMIGRANTS?
In this yarn it was made to appear that no one who
is afflicted with an infant has a hope of getting em-
ployment in this country. My experience is that,
though the daily papers “no encumbrance’’ advts.—put
in, I presume, from sordid and mercenary motives—
have done a certain amount of damage, things are by
no means so bad as they are represented. For ex-
ample, last week, I drew a registry office in quest of
a “general servant.” There was only one on offer in
the whole large, dusty establishment, and the pro-
prietors warned me that she didn’t profess to be a
cook, had been accustomed to “better things,” and
would require accommodation for her three-year-old
child. I replied that so long as she was not a con-
genital assassin, and did not get drunk more than
three times a week, she would do me. After an im-
pressive wait the employment-seeker strolled in, tow-
ing a frowsy little girl behind her. She said she was
from Manchester, and wanted 255. a week and beer-
money. She then asked if she could have a separate
room for the child. I thought it might be managed.
Was there a garden for the child to play in? Any-
dogs? The child disliked dogs. Any other children?
The child was shy, and got worried if there were
other babies about. I answered searching questions
as to the drains, the water supply, the aspect of the
room the child was to occupy, the name and reputa-
tion pf the milkman, and so on, till my head was in
a whirl. At length her interrogatories finished, and
she plunged deep in thought. She emerged from her
broodings with a start, said civilly, but firmly, that
she feared I wouldn’t suit, and left. I hadn’t banned
her; she had banned me. And, apparently, it was
mostly the child that had caused the rift. For me,
I am prepared to house an entire family so long as
I can get some sort of a servitor thrown in with the
bunch. And dozens of my friends look at things in
the same light.
BONES.

WANTED, to SELL Half Set of HUMAN RONES ;

Is he an immature M.D.
Who badly needs some cash,
This sacrificing A.B C. *
Who owns the bony trash?
Has he got sick of seeing it
On one leg like a crane?
Or did he keep the other bit
When it was cut in twain ?
Or has the other bit been sold
To one who wields the shin
When clamping down the carpet’s fold,
And driving tin tacks in?
(Some folk like this there are, I know,
And I would angered be,
Though I had died long years ago,
If they drove nails with me.)
Whose are these bones he has for sale?
Who grew them—Smitn or Jones?
When' o’er the hill I take the trail
I mean to take my bones.
But if my ghost evaporates
And leaves the burthen sad,
I shall turn back from Heaven’s gates
To save a similar ad.
And if the cloakroom cherubs cry,
“No bones! We ain’t allowed!”
I shall go tramping down the sky
Far from the haloed crowd.
A bag, a halo and a shroud!
Myself I plainly see,
With some most precious burthen bowed
AValking eternally!

FRESH SHIPMENT
OF “CREPE” SHIRTS.
DURING the oast few weeks we have restrained from adver-
tising this popular shirt solely on account of the pressing
demand on it from all quarters.
However, we have just opened up a new shipment, and will
be able now to meet all orders. We wish once again to
emphasise the long wear that our Special Crepe gives—as it
washes it becomes softer to the skin and finer in appearance—
it is cool and pleasant for warm days, and its designings are
better than usual shirtings.
The Crepe Shirt is supplied either with stiff cuffs and neck-
band, or with all soft, double turn-down collar, neckband and
cuffs.
PRICE, 5/6 EACH, 6d. extra posted, or 1/- extra for three
shirts.
Please state what size you take, also style of Shirt desired,

“Mayne Stay”: I agree with “Belaying
Pin” (B. 21/12/T1) that Justice Higgins’s
new Arbitration award for seamen is a good
one, and, for myself, I believe it goes about
as far as anyone could expect in present
conditions. I agree, too, with “8.P.” that
the union should try its hardest to keep its
members up to the mark, but I can’t endorse
his method of turning the undesirable men
out of the union. It would probably lead to
abuse. The continuous discharge system
would straighten out the kinks quicker and
better than any other method at all likely to
be adopted, although there is bitter opposi-
tion to it from the men who are likely to get
bad discharges. The regrettable thing about
it is that while these men are in the minority
they appear to have the most say in the
union. Personally, I have the idea that an
extra 10s. or fl a month to the man who
stays over six months in one ship—on the re-
commendation of the mate or engineer—
would be a big step forward, and would pay
in the long run. Also, I have visions of the
millennium.

Police Inspector Ellison, of M.L., gave
evidence before the N. S. Wales Totalisator
Commission in Wellington last Thursday,
and, according to the S. M. Herald, the fol-
lowing dialogue took place :
Mr. Ellison: The totalisator, in his opinion, was a
far better system for the public than bookmaking.
The machine carried on the business of the course on
a race day only, not all the year round. Race crowds
were more orderly nowadays than in the old days of
bookmakers.
Mr. Bruntnell: Are you aware we have a very
reputable class of bookmaker in New South Wales?
Mr. Ellison: I am aware you have men who will
pay what they owe, but I don’t believe you have
bookmakers who would not “stiffen” a horse if they
got a chance.
Mr. Bruntnell: I differ with you.
Will any Anti-Liquor champion, Social
Purity expert, saint, Two-up scotcher, or
other Wowser, contend, in face of the above,
that professional holy men, of the Bruntnell
type, are not the warm friends and valued
advocates of the Ring?
The whit e-vested
person who read
Gaud Mayor Allen
Taylor’s proud New
Year remarks about
the continued swelling
of Sydney during
1911 glowed with
pride—until he found
the usual item about
some workers’ de-
mand for another in-
crease in wages. Then his joy
passed away like thistledown be-
fore a racing southerly buster, and
all was dark as the bowels of a
cellar. A heap of the fat citizen’s
unhappiness is generated by the
big city he cherishes so violently.
He loves to see it put forth sky-
scrapers ; and every time the Gaud
Mayor tears up a place where
workers used to live, and plants
the stone seed of a tall importer’s
warehouse, he cheers and cham-
pagnes. Then the unhoused work-
ers ask for another penny an hour,
because the new landlord wants
more money, and the tram-guard
they didn’t have to pay when they
lived close in holds out his official
hand for his official coin. The stout
person reads about this in his
morning paper, as he travels to
his desk, and goes temporarily
mad. A bloated city is a sort of
commercial centipede, which keeps
on stinging itself with its own
tail. London, the world’s prize
example of bloatedness, has almost
ceased to build battleships, largely
on account of its high cost of liv-
ing and heavy local taxation, and
the battleship business has moved
to less inflated centres.
Auckland (M.L.) is beginning to have
some doubts about the “child-like wonder”
(as one of the Sydney dailies described it)
of the Japs who recently crowded ashore
there from the Aso and Soya, war cruisers
belonging to the child-like person recently in
Port Jackson. Note-books and maps seem
to have been much in the Aucklander’s eye,
although he appears to have been too polite
to mention it until his bright and merry
friends had departed. One newspaper re-
lates that a Jap lieutenant, accompanied by
a party of cadets, appeared at a house oc-
cupying a commanding position on the cliffs
and asked permission to use the garden, os-
tensibly to adjust compasses. The lady was
charmed to oblige, but, when the boss blew
in from work, and found his lawn turned
into a sort of naval base, he didn’t contri-
bute to the general friendliness. In fact,
he was as disconcerting as the Face at the
Window. Another joke—for the Japs—was
provided by the chairman of the Harbor
Board inviting a party of officers to have a
look round the harbor works. Still, that’s
not as good a one as the permission given
recently to the Nipponese explorers or some-
thing to camn for a month or so alongside
the forts at Sydney before they left for the
South Pole or somewhere.

“Leo Lear”: Men-
tion of paper towels
(B. 14/12/’ll) stirs
up a grievance within
me. The Victorian
and Ma State rail-
ways, on the through
run from Wallangarra
to Melbourne, are
mighty careful about
their washing. bills.
The lavatories are
supplied each with
one towel, on which
the whole corridor
wipes its mixture of
germs and beer. By
the time the last man
arrives the din of
battle among the fan-
tods and other fungi
in that rag can be
heard above the clat-
ter of the rails. Bana-
iwaland shows more
care for the health of
its migratory popula-
tion by providing a
rack-full of face-mons.
Moreover, if the
southern States can
for a moment leave
off guying Queensland about its nar-
row gauge, they might spend a second
or two in considering the matter of second-
class sleepers. Queensland has them, but
travellers on broad-gauge lines are evidently
not supposed to want sleep unless they are
either Fatmen or drummers.

The U.S. is the land of religious fads. The
17th of February, 1915, will be tbe hundredth
anniversary of the day when a British army
and a Yankee army last gunned at each
other in anger. Accordingly, Senator Elihu
Root, of the U.S. —a name curiously sugges-
tive of the famous but mythical Esau Slodge
of the same country—proposes thsit at a
fixed hour, minute and second, on that day,
the English-speaking folk all over the world
shall drop everything and spend five minutes
in silent prayer. When the silent prayer is
over, they will pick up everything and re-
sume business. And the man who leaves off
prayer first will pick up most, while the one
who prays longest will wonder where the
devil his goods have gone to.
A “small but enthusiastic” meeting has
been held in Adelaide, an Anti-Compulsory
Military Service League has been formed,
and “most of those present joined a com-
mittee to carry out the objects of the
League.” The objects are, it seems, “to
stand shoulder to shoulder in resisting the
compulsory clauses of the Defence Act.” So
they see that it is necessary to stand shoul-
der to shoulder to resist a piece of home-
grown legislation; also they see that it is
necessary to organise the resistance. But
when it is a matter of arguing with a for-
eign invader, apparently any old sort of un-
organised resistance is good enough. These
musty anti-Peace cranks are an illogical lot.
A Melbourne man writes: —
The recent burning of The Grange boardinghouse,
which stands in extensive grounds at the corner oi
Domain-road and St. Kilda-road, has recalled to Mel-
bourne notice the fact that the freehold title of the
propputy has always been under suspicion. A few
years back Premier Bent tajked of buying The
Grange estate for a State Governor’s residence, but
the project died on a rumor of a flaw in the title.
Seemingly, the State Government of long ago, when
it railed off the corner allotment and built a house
on it for the military commandant of the period,
was guilty of an illegal grab. The land is palpably
a portion of the original South Yarra Domain and
Botanical Gardens, dedicated to public use for all
time. The Government cribbed a bit for the com-
mandant’s residence, and when he left the country
or died, the same Government, or a successor, raised
a good few thousands by selling the property on cer-
tain “conditional” terms, which constitute the mys-
terious flaw in the title. Victorian Governments of
long ago were terribly hungry for land sale “re-
venue,” and this transaction was rather worse than
most others. So The Grange question had better be
settled by the Weary Government resuming posses-
sion of the land at its last cost price, and restoring
it to the Domain it was stolen from.
Melbourne’s latest tragedy was a study in
order. A young man called at a Jolimont
villa, and presently came out with his “girl.”
The r>air had gone only a few yards when a
man stepped from a shadow and accosted the
youth. There was a slight scuffle, then two
shots, and after that a dead man. Without
any fuss somebody telephoned for a doctor,
and somebody else called a constable. These
presently arriving, the victim was taken to
the morgue, and the youth and the woman
went in the doctor’s motor to the lock-up,
where the former was arrested on a charge
of murder. He calnily admitted the shoot-
ing, on the ground of self-defence, and the
woman just as calmly backed up his story.
Everything was tidy, orderly, matter-of-fact
—orderly and quiet as the dead man, who,
being shot through the heart, dropped where
he stood, without making a mess or creating
an uproar. The dead man was Frederick
Tullidge, who, in August last, had divorced
his wife, and it was the co-re. whom he was
about to rebuke when a bullet ended the
story. It is an unhappy tale, and the real
tregedy of it concerns the victim’s two smell
children, given to the deceased’s custody
when their mother was divorced.
“10-2-4” moralises: —
In Europe, when a country gets right down on its
financial uppers, when the last asset has gone up the
spout, and the bank account has been garnisheed,
and the bailiff lurks, ca. sa. order in hand, on the
doormat, it has still one last feather to fly with. It
may, as Portugal did last week, legalise the public
playing Of games of chance. When Homburg and
suchlike fashionable gaming resorts started to go
under before the combined assaults of German
Catholicism and German Wowserism, 50 years ago,
the Prince of Monaco saw his chance of evading
bankruptcy, and swiftly took it. Ever since he
made his famous contract with old Blanc, the Prin-
cipality has been a model of luxury and cheapness
from the point of view of the natives. Their roads,
bridges, water and sewerage supply, baths, opera
house and every other national and municipal ser-
vice have been paid for during all that time out of
the casino profits, and are the last words in perfec-
tion and efficiency. And so it will soon be, no
doubt, with Portugal’s large towns. Monte Carlo
has lost its vogue. It has become the Manly Beach
of Europe—a cheery but sordid little place where the
fastidious only go in search of health or of such
amusements as they may wish to enjoy under the
rose. It is the haunt of the raffish London man-
about-town, the Parisian “rasta,” the small, seedy
punter, the wilting lady of pleasure, and the German
Baron and French Count who hardly make a serious
pretence at being other than bogus.
Cintra, one of the places mentioned by Reuter, as
a future gaming resort, is even more beautiful,
naturally, than Monte Carlo. When it has had part
of the vast profits of a casino or two lavished on its
parks and public buildings it should be a paradise.
It is within a week’s comfortable ship and train
journey of London. The climate is perfect, unlike
that of Monaco, which is death on those who can’t
stand abrupt changes. It is practically run, in a
social manner of speaking, by an English colony
whose members are accustomed to say that it would
be one of the pleasantest places in the world only for
the Portuguese. The result is that all the sports
which Monaco discourages for the benefit of the
casino are in full swing ; and it is by so much the
more attractive to foreigners.
Certainly Portugal stands to make a fortune by
the new departure. On the other hand, it will lose
such faint remnants of moral and social prestige as
remain to it. The modern nation which legalises
baccarat and rouge-et-noir resembles the lady who
goes on the town or the gentleman who takes per-
manently to bar-loafing. Even Belgium shut down
firmly on the Ostend casino, the other day, though
the edict meant temporary ruin to the town. It is a
somewhat depressing thought that one of the first
uses the Republican Government of Portugal is
making of its rise to power is to turn the old semi-
nigger country into one of the few remaining two-up
schools of Europe.

RATS!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Age, starting an anti-rat crusade, describes
Melbourne as “a rat-infested city,” and calls upon
the council to make stringent law, compelling in-
dividual citizens to destroy their own rats.
This Melbourne is a stricken place,
And plagued with vermin gross and grim,
By reason of its lack of grace
And need of municipal vim.
At night come forth the warty rats,
All grey and grim and big as cats,
In bakers’ bins and brewers’ vats,
On bread and booze to sow disease.
The tradesmen must look after these.
But there are other rats that haunt
Our hapless town in light of day,
And they are old and foul and gaunt—
Sad is the havoc that they play.
Each stout old gentleman has got
One hid beneath his high stove-pot;
And hungriest of the awful lot
Is Anti-Sosh, a rat that weds
And builds and breeds in Fattest heads.
There are the State-Frights rats that swill
Their victim’s brains, and blind his eyes.
’Twill take a hefty swipe to kill
The rat of Private Enterprise.
The Argus has a fearsome one
Of capital upon the run.
Oh, Johnnie, Johnnie, get your gun
And shoot yon dilly rat that yaps
Of ruin wrought by “Labah” chaps!
The bigot rats from every clime,
The Orange rodent, and the ro-
Dent that makes of Defence a crime,
They’re dangerous, and all must go.
Fine, fine, indeed, when Reason reigns,
To see Fat citizens with canes
Engaged in cudgelling their brains,
Or, armed with clubs and cricket bats,
Devoutly beating out their rats.
VICTORIA.

A NEW RABBIT
EXTERMINATOR.
WAYVBACK LAD (strik-
ing his first motor-
car): “Rabbits must
be pretty bad' where
that cove's goin ter.”
“Pick”: “Jaloom”
(B. 28/12/’ll) says
he can walk at the tail of a
hurried or express snake.
Well, I once saw a carpet snake, considered the laziest
of the land-eels or animated ropes, catch a wildly-
fleeing kangaroo-rat after a 40yds. chase, and if
“Jaloom” can walk alongside a fully-extended ’roo-
rat he should come out and have a word with Don-
aldson. On level ground the snake’s progression is,
as a rule, leisurely enough; but when he makes a
break downhill, lightning has to shovel coal in the
furnace like mad to catch him. He seems to strike
the floor just twice in half a mile. I’m not talking
about Boxing Day snakes, either, nor about dragons,
flying devils, vampires, ghost-fowl, or anything of
that sort.
“Exile” (from U.S.A.) : Is coo-ee a
native Australian word ? It is, 1 find, commonly
used in the south of the United States as a cow-call,
and the folk there say that it originated in New Eng-
land. The darkies towards evening may be heard
calling, “Coo-ee, coo-ee!” and when the milk enve-
lope hears it she starts for her domicile immediately.
“J.G.”: All I can put forward in reply to
the scepticism of “Bilbax” (B. 7/12/’ll) regarding
the belief generally held by miners that dynamite
strikes downward, is my own experience of explo-
sives. Wherever I have seen dynamite at work it
has torn things about below its bed, whilst blasting
powder, on the other hand, unless put in a deeply-
drilled hole in a rock or a log, or something equally
solid, and tamped in and rammed solid, does no
worse than puff out in a cloud of smoke. Where the
powder teas tamped in properly, the result of the ex-
plosion was the shattering above and round about of
the object attacked. It was very seldom that the
effects could be seen further down than the bottom
of the drilled hole. Dynamite requires no tamping.
To tear out a tree stump, for instance, no more is
necessary than to bore a hole, insert the plug and
pour in a pint or so of water to keep the air out.
I have seen the earth ripped open for several feet
below the depth of the plug in such cases, while, if
powder had been used the result would merely have
been a miniature geyser. But if “Bilbax” is really
anxious to learn the comparative effects of explod-
ing dynamite and powder, all he has to do is to fire
a charge of each from a gun. If I don’t hear from
him again I’ll know he’s done it.
* * * *
“Kangaroo” writes from the island of that
name: “Kangarooster” (B. 30/11/’U) does well to
advocate Nepean Bay, Kangaroo Island, as one of the
naval bases for the Australian Navy. With the build-
ing of the Perth-Adelaide and Port Darwin-Adelaide
railways, Adelaide will become, perhaps, the chief
defence railway centre in the Commonwealth, and
will need to be protected accordingly. A fleet, con-
sisting of torpedo boats, destroyers and submarines,
stationed at Nepean Bay, would be able to command
both entrances to St. Vincent’s Gulf. They (the en-
trances) are within two hours’ steaming of each
other, and the waters are ideally suited for submarine
work. Additional protection could be given by erect-
ing big guns on Capes Willoughby, Jervis, Point
Marsden and Troubridge. With a railway across the
island, Vivonne Bay, on the south coast, could be
made a coaling depot for the cruisers, etc., patrolling
the Southern Ocean in time of war, and it would at
the same time control the only other landing on the
island by which an enemy would be able to reach
the base. With St. Vincent’s Gulf thus protected,
mail and inter-State boats, harassed by an enemy,
could make for either Backstairs Passage or Investi-
gator Straits, where they would find protection. It
would make no difference how many boats sought
harborage to escape the reach of the enemy’s guns;
the gulf would have room for them all. As a harbor,
Nepean Bay is protected by a sandspit, about six
miles long, inside of which submarines, etc., would
find smooth water in all weathers, with a depth of
from two and three-quarter fathoms to four fathoms,
while Eastern Cove is capable of taking the largest
ships afloat. Finally, consider what would happen if an
enemy got possession of Kangaroo Island. From it
the invaders would be able to go out and waylay all
ships bound from the eastern States to the West,
England, Suez, and South Africa, and bring them
back to Nepean Bay as prizes, or sink them. Have
I not grounds for my contention that this island
should, at least, be visited by the authorities before
the base in South Australia is finally decided on?
“Mclntyre”: Re snake pace. Helped to
time a brown six-footer t’other day from its nest to
a bunch of prickly-pears, a distance of 80yds. The
distance was covered in ssec. If “Leo Lear’s” tiger
can put up a better record, he can, as far as I am
concerned, hang the blue ribbon round his particular
reptile’s neck.
“Tiaki” : I wrote a par in The Bulletin
recently about the affection of the octopus for human
people, and somebody rushed me with a demand for
authentic instances. Here’s a couple. During Christ-
mas week, a girl, 10 years of age, while paddling her
feet in the sea at Island Bay, near Wellington (M.L.),
had her leg pulled to such purpose by an octopus
that she shrieked like Freedom on an historical oc-
casion. Her father, who, fortunately, was close at
hand, rushed up just in time to prevent her being
hauled from the rock upon which she was seated, but
he was unable to dislodge the tentacles of the marine
devil, and, in his turn, had to shake up. the welkin
considerably. His outcries brought three ladies from
the beach, and by the combined struggles of four
people the child was freed. The other instance was
also in Wellington, and concerned a fisherman who
went into the water waist-deep to free his line. He
was immediately gripped by Beelzebub’s marine
agent, and anchored down. The tide and the fisher-
man’s hair were rapidly rising when a picnic party
butted into the proceedings with a boat-hook. The
octopus thereupon agreed, though reluctantly, that it
was no place for him ; that the time was not ripe,
and that the Constitution was in danger. These are
two cases to go on with.

“Matelot”: Writing from Cape Leeuwin
to The Bulletin (28/12/’ll), “Mallarapoonie” gives
a picture of the western outlying cape of the Aus-
tralian continent, that Dampier, the “prince of nauti-
cal description,” could not have excelled in its
vigorous terseness and simplicity of language, albeit
“Mallarapoonie” brings in the wreck of the Pericles,
in which some people lost their pyjamas and hat-
pins. One “survivor” of that catastrophe is now,
and has been for the past two years, engaged in
writing an account of the terrible adventures of his
wife and himself, and I am not interfering with the
copyright when I say that it is no less than the
dire truth that he “lost all his luggage, which was
uninsured and worth £4O, whilst some of the sailors
lost nothing”! “Mallarapoonie’s” vivid portrait of
the Leeuwin and its vicinity reminds me of another
headland with the same characteristics. This is the
•north point of the island of Eua, one of the Tongan
group. The cliff, one solid mass of grey, upheaved
coral rock, rises sheer to a height of 600 ft. or more,
and its base is swept by a furious current. The
summit is covered with a low, dense thicket scrub,
the breeding-place of the frigate and other sea-birds,
and the whole aspect is forbidding and depressing.
I once walked to the verge of the cliff, but no native
would accompany me. “It would be bad luck,” they
said, “to look over.” They told me a yarn that,
when Parker Brothers, of Sydney, had a sheep station
on Eua, in the early ’7o’s, 500 of the wool producers,
led by a ram, made their way to the edge of the
cliff, and placidly stepped over. I asked the Rev.
Shirley Baker, the Poo-Bah of Tonga, if it was true,
but he said, in effect, that it was a dashed fabrica-
tion. I let it go at that.
* * * *
“Snell”: Suicidal tendencies were very
marked in Andrew Martin. For over 10 years he had
betrayed the symptoms. It took very little to
drive him to suicide; a few drinks, a cross word, a
bit of bad luck, a change in the weather, a sore toe,
or a casual disappointment—any of these was suffi-
cient. I never knew a man so self-destructive. The
fact that he contrived to live through it all must be
ascribed to his exceeding toughness. At the Two
Mates mine, Eagle, there was a large living hut for
the men. It had a range of bunks on one side like
store shelves. Here three shifts pigged in fraternal
discomfort. One Sunday night, after two dozen of
bottled beer had been broken open, and a few pounds
had been lost and won at euchre, Andrew Martin
suddenly arose from the table, with a fixed purpose
and a look of terrible resolution. “Here, I’m full o’
this” ; he said. “I’m sick of livin’—sick of every-
thin’. So long all!” “Gorn’ t’ kill yerself ag’in,
Andy ?” said Coleman, looking up froip his cards.
“I am,” Andrew replied with deathly calm. “This
time nothin’ stops me.” He fished a clothes line
from under Strack’s bunk. At the door he stood,
white but resolute. “Good-bye, boys. Godblesher!”
he said. He went out into the darkness, and the
absorption of bottled beer and the card argument
went on far into the night, and over into next day.
Towards two in the morning the door was violently
opened, and Andrew Martin appeared. It had been
raining, and he was wet through. The rope hung
about his neck in a noose, his face was white, his
eye impressive. “Gordammit!” he snorted, “Am
I t’ be left hangin’ there all night?”
“Dynamo”: Swarms of black beetles are
invading parts of Gippsland (Vic.) just now, and
where I am (Korumburra) they literally storm any
well-lit locality. Emptied a bucket-load out of the
power-house the other night, and was struck by the
fact that the beasts were covered with small, white
lice, something akin to the parasites that battle for
a crust upon the surface of the domestic fowl. From
observation, I find that these beetles do not live 5 more
than a couple of hours, and my curiosity would get
back to its normal heat if anybody could explain
whether the sudden death is caused by closer settle-
ment.
“J. 5.8.”: The information offered by
“E.W.O’D.” (B. 28/12/T1), about posts and post-
holes is as vague as a “Liberal” politician’s
description of the Socialistic tiger. The nature of
the country doesn’t matter so much as the quantity
of timber the fencing expert is game to chop off
the bottom of the post. If a 6ft. post is put into a
2ft. hole, 4ft. of post remains above the surface ; but
if 6in. of post is cut off with the axe the fencer
always keeps handy, an 18in. hole produces the
same result. The art of rapid fencing lies in a man’s
ability to plant the chips and discarded lumps of
post where the boss won’t find them.
*.* * *
“Wang”: “9-3-11” (B. 16/11/T1) is quite
right about the improvidence of the average cocky
in the good seasons. All the insistence that can be
brought to bear upon the casual cuss as to the neces-
sity of making provision for a droughty day, and all
the points and hints given on the preparing of ensi-
lage and the making of silos, appear (o be of com-
paratively no avail. The cocky agrees that the idea
is first-class, but says it is too expensive: for a poor
man. Perhaps the up-to-date, brick-built silo is too
expensive for the ordinary settler, but, if he wasn’t
such a shiftless, bat-eyed bloke, he’d know the value
of a hole in the ground for storing tucker for the
stock. It might not turn out the same quality of
tucker as that dished up from the elaborate artificial
contrivance, but it is not bad tucker, and, when
there is no other kind of tucker on the premises,
not bad tucker becomes dashed fine tucker. The
silos of my farming days were just holes in the
ground, a disused quarry-hole or a dried
water-hole; sometimes, even, a cocky was ener-
getic and far-sighted enough to dig a
hole. These were filled up with surplus grass, and
other fodder, and covered over with tree branches
and a layer of straw. On top of all a few tons of
earth was piled, to keep out the air. Some of the
finest ensilage I’ve seen was made from the huge,
variegated thistle, that prickly monster - that some-
times shoves itself 10ft. or more into the air, and
requires a sharp axe or billhook to hew it down. I
don’t know what the ensilage of a modern silo is
like. The stuff that was hooked out of the old-time
silos was rotten-looking tack, like huge masses of
wet tobacco. But the smell of it was sweet, and 1
never heard any complaints from the cow about its
taste, while, judging by the appearance of the ani-
mals, the nutritive quality was able to get a move
on in the right direction.
MONEY IN HIS BOOTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Not long since, a countryman who had placed bank-
notes in his boots for safety, and worn them out
in tramping the city streets, received £3 10s. in
gold from the Treasury for the tattered fragments
which, with diligence, he was able to extract. —News
item.
When with his axe Bill’s earned enough,
Straight down to town he scoots,
Pausing for half a jiff to stuff
Some bank notes in his boots.
The honest trees he knows rush past
The windows of his train,
Until he rattles in at last
To Sydney once again.
Fierce engines hiss like snakes at him,
And tram-cars snarl and flash,
As from the station, grimed and grim,
He does a country dash.
Small newsboys howl of blanky deeds;
The tangled traffic roars ;
Demented, here and there he speeds
And strangers’ aid implores.
At last a cabman sights his prey,
And drives him off with pride
Where for his bed a bob he’ll pay.
(The menu hangs outside).
Somewhere adjacent to the sky
They’ll stow suspicious Bill;
And cits will see as they pass by
His socks upon the sill.
For, when he’s sick of asphalt ways,
He seeks his high retreat,
Washes his socks, and through the haze
Looks down upon the street.
Barefooted, collarless, unbraced,
His old pipe drawing well,
He mumbles, without spite or haste,
“Now they can go ter H —1!”
His slow thoughts now on spielers run,
And uncles in Fiji,
And ev’ry sort of “crook” and “gun”
Who lives by trickery.
All day he braved the land-shark’s teetn,
And walked about alone,
His spare notes merely hid beneath
Twelve stone of meat and bone.
All day he guarded well his wealth,
And watched that no galoots
Kept him engaged, while one by stealth
Unlaced and robbed his boots.
But, safe on high, at sunset he
Indraws a thankful breath:
“Beat ’em again ! They said I’d be
Took down, as sure as death! ”

“Matelot” : Re the giant deep-sea octo-
pus, the especial bonne bouche of the sperm whale
in the Pacific, and the resultant ambergris. In
August, last year, a native of Futuna (Horne Islands,
300 miles west from Samoa) picked up, whilst fish-
ing off Singavi Harbor, a lump of ambergris weigh-
ing 7ilb. Knowing what it was and something of
its value, he kept his discovery to himself, trusting
neither the local trader at Singavi nor the mission-
aries on the island. He made his way to Noumea in
the French cruiser liersaint, and sold the goods to
the skipper of a labor schooner for 1000 francs. The
skipper must have done well out of the deal, for am-
bergris, even in its crude state, impregnated thickly
with the steel-hard fragments of the bills of the giant
octopii, brings £5 per ounce in the London and
Continental markets. It is used as the basis for the
manufacture of high-class perfumes, having the ex-
traordinary power of developing the smells tenfold.
The writer has bought, handled and sold many lumps
of ambergris obtained from natives and traders in
the North and South Pacific, and found that in ap-
pearance and color it varied tremendously ; but such
great whaling authorities as Surgeons Bennett and
EMPHASIS AND BREVITY.
CHAIRMAN: “All in favor uv th' motion?”
THE MEETING: “My oath!”
CHAIRMAN: “Carried like 'Ell!”
Beale agree that it is all the Jesuit of constipation
in the sperm whale—cetacean appendicitis, in fact.
In all the specimens that have been found, bits of
the black, parrot-like bill of the deep-sea octopus,
ranging up to 4in. or sin. in length, 3in. in width,
and lin. to 2in. thick, make the stuff resemble a
well-raisined plum duff. The big teeth of the mighty
cachalot, with his tremendous jaw-power, which
crushes a whaleboat like an egg-shell, makes short
work of this hideous and loathsome monster of the
ocean’s depths. But, like all high-livers, the sperm
whale pays the penalty. The ventral passage be-
comes blocked, and sometimes, unable to avoid the
obstruction, the whale runs ashore and dies. This
has been well proven. Ambergris, if a lighted match
is applied to it, burns freely, giving out a pale
yellow flame with a vanilla-like odor.

“T.V.T.”; The disc-plough has been a
potent factor in breaking up the scrub-lands of Eastern
Gippsland. With its advent, the “slasher” supplanted
the mattock, and vast areas of land, covered with ti-
tree and kindred scrub, that would otherwise require
years of labor to grub and prepare for the mouldboard
plough, have simply been slashed and burned and
then ripped up with the disc. Bullocks, or a trac-
tion engine, furnish the best motive power for
the disc-plough. Horses are too easily “staked” by
the little sharp stumps of ti-tree left by the slasher,
but a team of bulls will plod along all day without
injury in ground where the spikes are as freely dis-
tributed as stoves in Sheol.

“Boronia”: I don’t want to be hard on
anybody, but the Abos. who declare that jarrah piles
can defy Teredo Navalis, Esq., don’t know
the gentleman. For years Westralian
Governments have been replacing jarrah
piles, which have emerged second best
from an argument with him, as Premier
Scaddan admitted not long ago in the
Assembly. Now it is reported that scores
of jarrah piles in the Fremantle wharves
have been utterly destroyed by the marine
excavator. Similarly, Premier Ward, of
Maoriland, recently stated that piles of
the same religion, at the Wellington
wharves, had been eaten by the same
assailant, in from eight to 15 years. Of
course, these responsible officials may be
wrong, and the irresponsible Abos. cor-
rect; still, if there is any betting to be
done, I have a dark sort of a kind of
suspicion where my tuppence will be dis-

bores, the other day, he found 487 left, after elimi-
nating all that walked on legs—2ll of them public
bores and 276 private. They run in all shapes. On
Killara the officers struck a flow at 46ft.; at Boronga,
near Moree, the Government had to punch down
4341 ft. before it could get a wash. When the
Boronga flow was tapped it was worth having,
though; the gauge shows over a million gallons a
day. Around Walgett and Moree you can take the
biggest drink, without fear of emptying the barrel.
There are six taps on the stock routes around Moree
that spurt out over a million gallons a day apiece,
and four around Walgett do the same. In a general
way you never know whether a bore is going to boil
you or give you the cold shivers. When you hold
your billy oyer the Clifton spout, on the road be-
tween Milparinka and Wanaaring, you get your liquor
at 139 degrees, while at Warren it comes up at only
70 degrees. The drill hasn’t struck an absolute
blank in many places; mostly when it has failed
it has been because, for some mysterious reason, it
has got into salt water. Still, the percentage of fail-
ures is small: of the 211 bores which the State has
put down or suppressed, only 22 have had to be
written off as a bad job entirely, and they are mostly
out towards the droughty Barrier Range, where,
there being so little moisture on the surface, it was
well worth taking a risk to find out if there was a
trifle more in the innards,
THE BEST PROOF.
There is no question that Chamberlain’s Tablets
are the best preparation on the market to-day for all
derangements of the stomach and bowels. There is
no better proof of this than that every person who
has benefited by their use wishes all other sufferers
to know of Chamberlain’s Tablets. Mrs. S. L. Mor-
rison, Humffray Street, Ballarat, Vic., says: “Both
my mother and I are firm believers in Chamberlain’s
Tablets. We have used them for stomach and liver
troubles, and have found them effective. The use of
most pills is followed by constipation, but Chamber-
lain’s Tablets are so mild and gentle in their action
that thev have no bad after-effects.”*
“Dirk Swincott” : At one time or another
I’ve worked alongside almost every variety of the white
race, and have toiled as well with Chows and other dis-
colored institutions; but this last harvest I had the
queerest mate of all sprung upon me. The gentle-
man with the scrambled whiskers to whom I owed
allegiance sent over his daughter to do turn and
turn about with me at the winnower. I suppose
this kind of thing is usual in the district where
cow is queen; but, in the wheat country, I took it
as a low-down trick. My native chivalry prevented
me from letting my fair partner do any of the heavier
work. At least, it did for the first day; but when
I found the lady was my equal in strength, whether
of brawn or of language, I let her do her whack, and
was even ungallant enough at times to let her do a
whack and a quarter.

“F.C.”: I don’t want to reopen the dis-
cussion about shade trees which I started a while
back, but I badly want to insult the evil-disposed
individual who advised me to try the currajong. In
the natural simplicity of my heart I didn’t dream he
was pulling my leg; but I know better now. I put
in a row of trees—some sugar-gums, two scarlet
flowering gums, golden wattles, Cootamundra dittos,
and two currajongs, all being about 6in. high when
I got them, last June. The sugar gums are now be-
tween 18in. and 2ft. above the ground, and the
scarlet gums and wattles more than half as high;
but as for the. currajongs, one turned up its little
roots almost immediately; while the other, though
still alive, only puts forth a new shoot tentatively.
Its present height is what a tradesman would call
6in. bare. It is undoubtedly a fine shade tree —for
an ant or a small worm. But I wasn’t studying these
beasts; it was the house I wanted to shade. Even
John Weary couldn’t rest easily under a currajong
that had been planted less than 20 years.
IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS.
“ What do you think of this ’ere doctrine about
the survival of the fittest?”
“It's all right , so far. I'm stil alive."
P-F. : Does anybody know anything
about aboriginal “albinos” ? Queensland papers of
50 years ago mention a tribe of these freaks —
“men with conical-shaped heads, wholly devoid of
hair except a small tuft at the lowest point of the
the cerebellum, just over the back of the neck.”
Kanaka albinos are not uncommon, but the myalls
abovementioned apparently formed a distinct clan,
and were not merely individuals with eccentric
characteristics.
“Well, you are back. Back from a season of
pleasure arid recuperation'. Vacation time is over
and metaphorically speaking you pull oif your coat
ready to once more bend yourself to the allotted task.
Beady to tackle the problems that have been accumu-
lating since you left. You remember last year how
unpleasant this was. You remember too you were
asking yourself how could you lighten that task.
May be by invention this can be done. You might
try.” Phillips Ormonde & Co., patent attorneys,

“Exile” writes from St. Louis, U.S.A. -
it o A .T rican lawyer” (B. 3/8/’ll) says “the
United States is, above all, the place of homes,” and
extols the work done in the beautification of the
cities.
1 have been three years in the States, and declare
that the lawyer tells but half the truth. Wealth
has its homes, of course—as it has everything else,
the middle-class also has its homes. But the home
ot the worker is not on a level with the home of the
Australian worker—not by a long way.
Start from the bottom. The “nigger” doesn’t
count, of course. There are only 10 millions of
him, and he lives ’most any old way, as niggers
should. The “Dago” is not reckoned either. There
are millions of him doing all sorts of hard and
heavy work. His pay of from one dollar 25 cents
to one dollar 75 cents per day does not enable him
to have a home, so he has a kennel instead. Perhaps
he prefers the kennel. He’s just a “Dago,” anyway.
Then the man who gets from 17 dollars to 20 dollars'
weekly—what of his home? Externally, it is not
too bad, for it is built for show. No privacy, as we
know it in Australia—just row after row of flats,
mostly three rooms to each set of apartments ; back
yards in common; front scrap of lawn, ditto. No
room for children—and none wanted, as a rule.
Hobbies for the worker out of the question. How’s
that for a home?
Then there are the “roomers.” These are not
single men and women, but married couples who
rent a single room. They infest the city in thou-
sands. They have no home—eat and sleep in the
one room; and the child is absent, which perhaps
is best for the child.
The American knows how to lavish money on the
“boulevards,” where the wealthy live; but just
round the corner, near the homes of the worker, the
streets are very often unpaved and undrained to an
extent not known in any Australian city. A com-
mon sight is a big red notice stuck on the front door
of these dwellings: “Scarlet fever —keep out”;
“Diphtheria—keen out,” etc. These tell the tale,
and the death-rate keeps well up. The United States
alone of all the civilised peoples publishes no vital
statistics. Just as well. They wouldn’t look good.
I don’t know New York. Perhaps it is all the
lawyer says. But St. Louis, the fourth city of the
States, I do know. It isn’t beautiful, and it isn’t
being beautified, unless one refers only to the
lovely boulevards lined with the homes of the fortu-
nate wealthy. Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Balla-
rat, and many others—-I know them all. American
cities are not beautiful as they are beautiful; and
never will be while graft is as general as it is now.
The American pays far more in city taxes than
the Australian does, and gets far less for his money.
Says the lawyer: “Not all of this is finished, but
all of it is planned.” The American is the “boss”
planner of this earth. I’ve lost count of the number
of “plans” that have been put out for the beautifica-
tion of St. Louis since I have lived in it. Not one
of them has got past the “planning,” and never will.
The people don’t expect that they should. They feel
good when they read big head-lines in the daily
paper: “St. Louis to have a River Drive.” There
won’t be a drive, and we all know there won’t
be one. But it gives the American a chance to let
off hot air, and then he is happy.
♦
N.S.W. Land Appeal Court, a tribunal ap-
pointed to untangle some of the webs into
which the Land Laws drop the cocky, is
now composed of three ex-Under Secretaries
of the Lands Department. Originally, the
Court consisted of one high legal expert
(Judge Rogers), one red-tape expert,
and one man skilled in the things of the
bush. The legal expert and the man from
the land have dropped out, and two more
Under Secretaries have been promoted to
the Court to join their brother Under Secre-
tary. Lessees and intending lessees grow
increasingly uneasy at this, as many of the
cases are appeals from the decisions of the
Lands Departments; and they are not at all
comforted when they remember that lately
the retiring Commissioner Brandis —the
real land expert—was very frequently in a
minority when appeals were being decided,
the majority being the two ex-civil servants.
If the idea now is to merely register the de-
partmental view, then it seems a waste of
money to have a Court at all.
“Boh”: A girl who is in the habit of whip-
ping up charity entertainments confided her
woes to me the other day. Here is her wail :“Yes,
first of all I rush round and collect a crowd
of likely-looking children. I rehearse them
till I have a voice like an oyster-vendor or
‘rabbit-o,’ and the people next door
grumble and threaten to move. Then, when
the time comes for getting the costumes, the
performers start to revolushe. They can’t
make them, and they can’t get them, and
‘they aren’t going in’—as if it was a cold
bath ! Every boy-Jack and girl-Jinny
wants to be a principal, and I am fre-
quently informed “Mother says I am to be
a contralto !” The boys get jealous of one
another and refuse to sing; so I find myself
with a half-dumb company, and get des-
perate. The family, which has been watch-
ing me all along with silent contempt, seizes
the chance to tell me that it serves me
right. By threats and pleadings I get my
team going again, and the night of the show
crawls down the calendar towards us like a
death adder. When the fatal moment has
arrived, and the hall caretaker has a good
grip on the curtain ropes, the kiddies look
so nice and docile that I feel a brute for
having been stuffy with them. A wild
skirmish the last second before curtain-rise
makes me see red again, and I start them
on the opening chorus with set teeth. As
the curtain goes up, I shake my fist from
the wings and observe bitterly: ‘After this
show we part for ever!’ Rather to my sur-
prise, the parents and friends in front get
almost hysterical with enthusiasm at seeing
the family on the stage, and the affair is a
great success. Being called before the cur-
tain, I suddenly remember that I have
given my last spare hairpin to one girl and
my shoes to another. They are hurriedly
dragged off, and I hastily resume my pro-
perty prior to taking the call. At going-
home time I am embraced by all the kiddies
in turn, and they leave the precincts of the
hall plaintively inquiring, ‘How about the
next practice?’ This, fellow taxpayers, is
how we partly provide for the sick and
afflicted.”

THE CAT: A THEOLOGICAL PROBLEM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sing ho! Sing hey! The holy man
Who lives next door to me,
His name is on the “District Plan,”
He is a stalwart Wes-ley-an,
And full of pietee.
I used to keep the church front door,
A godly man was I.
I practically never swore—
But that was long ago, before
My neigbor came anigh.
He hath a cat of morals loose,
A beast of Stygian hue,
And it is Thomas’s nightly use
Outside my room to raise the deuce
The weary watches through.
And I have tested every trick
Experience hath taught;
The poisoned chop, the whirling brick,
The rabbit trap, the loaded stick —
All, all have come to naught i
Now, if my soul be cast away
For all the oaths I swear,
Can any theologian say
Shall Thomas’ owner have to pay
II is fair and honest share ?
Let all the horrid tale be told.
The inky outcast brute
Of late hath often made him bold
To raid my cherished chickenfold,
With strategy astute.
And I forsake my father’s kirk,
And, with a pagan hoof,
I break the Sabbath. Hard at work
I plan and sweat the cat to burke
With chicken-coops of proof.
My sinful soul is sick and sore.
Can Mitre, Stole, or Hat
My pristine innocence restore,
Or must I stumble more and more,
Sing ho ! The man I was before,
Sing hey! The saint who lives next door,
Sing hey! Sing ho! The Cat!

Died at Castlemaine (Vic.), after step-
ping lightly along the journalistic track for
54 years, James Robertson, aged 88. Robert-
son, a Scot from Glasgow, arrived in Mel-
bourne in 1852, and soon drifted up to
Mount Alexander, as Castlemaine was then
called. There he joined the local Mail,
and, getting on to the editorial treadmill,
worked it for the best part of half a cen-
tury—latterly as part proprietor. It was
only during the last couple of years that he
handed over the dry bones of his job to a
younger practitioner.
Sank at his moorings, in his 70th year,
Henry Newton, who for 30 years was em-
ployed in the maritime division of the
N.S.W. Public Service. He was a pilot in
the old windjammer days, when the clippers
in full sail would beat up both Port Jackson
and Newcastle,. and rose to be Superinten-
dent of Navigation. If there is any particu-
larly snug anchorage for genial old salts on
the Jasper Sea, Henry Newton is quite safe
to bring up there.

“Bails”: Tom Pawley, manager of the
English cricket team in Australia, manages
the Kent county club. Appointed after a
disastrous season in 1897, he brought in 200
new members at one swoop, and went on
hand over hand until he had raised the roll
from under 1500 to over 4000. He managed
the Kent tour in America in 1903; and
Burnup, the captain, declared that it was
“owing to Pawley’s excellent arrangements
that the thing went through without a
hitch.” Before taking on a county he was
lion. sec. of the Tunbridge Club, and saved
its ground by collecting £2637 in less than
three months. In earlier days he did some-
thing as a fast bowler, and once took three
wickets for 11 runs against Sussex.

Edward Arnold Hill, of Tenterden

ing married the poet’s daughter Bertha. He
never married anybody himself.
Thomas McKay threw in the towel at
Napier (M.L.) last week after 103 rounds
with Time, unless the calculation was
wrong, which it probably was. He lived
under six British sovereigns, which equals
120 shillings, or 480 thrippences, represent-
ing 480 pints of good, bad or indifferent
beer; but T. McKay never shook his whisk-
ers in the froth of a solitary one of them.
“Rad” speaks a word: —
It is diverting to note the deadly seriousness with
which the Australian dailies treat their cables con-
cerning Winston Churchill’s proposed visit to Belfast.
Churchill is, of course, working up the agitation for
all he is worth. Barring a few semi-demented
Orangemen (who are, innocently, his most valuable
allies in the matter), it is obvious that no one is tak-
ing him and his approaching daredevilry seriously—
as witness Stead’s elaborately ironical suggestion that
Winston’s colleague Birrell should prohibit him from
speaking, in the interests of law and order. Churchill
is a born showman. The limelight is the breath of
life to him. It will be one of the golden hours of his
crowded existence when he drives slowly through
Belfast, with hundreds of police guarding his car-
riage, and an immense mob screaming cries of love
and admiration and fear and hatred in his ears. As
an instance of Churchill’s demagogish passion for the
spectacular element that is afforded by vast crowds,
he was booked, during last general elections, to speak
at. Crewe (England). The local party organisers de-
ceived the populace as to the spot where he was to
arrive, with the well-meaning idea of saving him
worry. As a result, he proceeded to the Town Hall
through deserted streets. “Where’s the crowd?” be
demanded passionately. The organisers explained
what they had done. “Well, I’m d —d if I speak,”
said Churchill, and, despite their anguished pleadings,
to that resolution he stuck. There is no doubt he
has had Ulster Hall engaged for his meeting with the
deliberate design of causing a shindy. Fear is a sen-
sation he does not know, and he does his best plat-
form work in the face of opposition. No one will be
more gratified than Churchill if his coming arouses
such a pandemonium in Belfast as the sectarianism-
crazed old place hasn’t known in its history.
Mary Gaunt, the Australian —daughter of
old Judge Gaunt, of Victoria, and sister of a
naval captain or two —has been making
some confessions in London. For her first
book, “Dave’s Sweetheart,” written in 1893,
she got £5O from the London publisher.
Then she married a doctor and gave up
writing; but, being left a young widow, she
had to earn her own living, so turned to the
inkpot again. Her first year in London was
bitter; she wrote a story every week, but
nearly all of them came
back rejected, and she
earned only £l5. Then she
was commissioned to write
a book on West Africa, suc-
ceeded, and has since made
that country her hunting-
ground, with excellent re-
sults. Her next book will
be a volume of personal ad-
ventures, with the title of
“Alone in West Africa.”
Australia has lost Thomas
Hardy, an Adelaide patri-
arch, who had done more
than most other men to
carl-y out the patriarchal
duty of making glad the
hearts of men with wine
and oil. A Devonshire boy,
he was in S. Aus. by 1850,
and took service with John
Reynell, reputed the earli-
est winemaker there. A
little later, he made some
money in the Victorian dig-
gings, and put it all into
the rich soil of the Torrens
valley, and the ideal wine-
growing slopes of the Ade-
laide hills. For over half a
century he had been ex-
porting wine; he started the
first city wine-bar, and had
much to do with demolish-
ing the idea —now extinct,
but long fostered by the im-
porter—that it was not the
Thing to offer your friends
“colonial” wine. At S.
Australia’s Jubilee Exhibi-
tion, he won a big trophy,
given by E. T. Smith, for
the exhibitor who had “done
most to establish new in-
dustries suitable to S.A.”
He deserved it. The Hardy
business is now owned by a co. R. B.
Hardy, the veteran’s only surviving son, is
its manager in Sydney.
William Knox, of the Hat, who dropped
out of Federal politics on account of his
health, had a father alive until last week.
Knox, senior, was nearer 90 than SO when
he died, so there is reason to expect that son
Bill’s liat will be long in the land if it takes
care of itself. A great thing in this world
is to be able to afford to take care of one-
self. Old James Copeland, who passed out
at Warragul (Vic.), the other day, aged 96,
was one time a partner in a Melbourne soft-
goods firm, but noticing that his health was
beginning to fail, he took up a selection at
Warragul. and lived a healthful life there
for a further 32 years.
A merciless winter having smothered
Canada and frostbitten it in 4,000,000
places, Pie Commissioner Gorge Feed has
now a chance to dish the Canadians, and
ladle out shiploads of immigrants by furi-
ously advertising. “No Blizzards in Aus-
tralia ! We don’t Know a Snow Plough
from an Egg Whisk! All Our Ice Is
Carted!” Someone should pursue and wake
Gorge up at whatever banquet he is sleeping
at, and ask him what course he intends tak-
ing. And the odds are that Gorge will mur-
mur : “Why, the next one! What is it—
entrees or sweets?”

Bert Levy is a versatile sort of citizen.
His vaudeville show represents but one of
many outlets for his abounding vitality. Every
week that he is in New York he writes and
profusely illustrates for the Morning Tele-
graph a full-page dealing with the theatre.
He has a standing contract to write and
illustrate special articles for the New York
Herald. (These articles are syndicated
and appear in some hundreds of papers all
over the United States.) His personal
notes _ concerning notabilities he has met
on his travels are rushed by the Ameri-
can papers in much the same way that T. P.
O’Connor’s goods of the same sort are rushed
in England. _ In between times he is by way
of being an inventor and mechanician. For
instance, _ the contrivance with which he
throws his drawings in a magnified form on
the screen, during his present Tivoli turn,
was designed by him, and every detail of it
, —barring the lenses —was made with his
own hands in his own workshop. Inciden-
tally, he is an aurist. For 20 years, owing
to an attack of typhoid, he has been practi-
stone deaf. Most of the big ear special-
ists in Europe and America have had a go
at his trouble, and retired defeated. Ulti-
mately. he though out and built a sort of
sounding board, which he wears in either
ear, and which enables him to hear as well
as any man. Small wonder that even in the
Pork City of Chicago, this Australian artist
is hailed as a pure-bred hustler.
, With the retirement of Tame Parata from
M.L. Parliament goes the smasher of many
a threatened stonewall. Tame was a strong
follower of old-man Seddon. Sometimes in
the early hours of the morning, when things
were going askew with the party, Seddon
would put up the old rangitira. Imme-
diately Tame rose to l'torero (through an in-
terpreter) members would show a large de-
sire to get home to bed; and then business
began to move. After Seddon glided over
the border Tame Parata fell into political
oblivion: and now returns, almost unnoticed,
to his whare and his old kiwi mat.
“Lex” :
Barrister Milner Stephen, who will be Deputy Lord
Mayor while Allen Taylor is taking his rest cure, is
probably the youngest-looking man for his age in
Australia. Dunno exactly what his age is, but he
looks about 30 years less than he is, whatever he is.
(This appearance of youthfulness is, by the way,
one of the most marked characteristics of the
numerous Stephens of N. S. Wales. They hardly ever
begin to look even elderly till long after they are
dead.) Milner Stephen is a good lawyer, a solid
worker and a reliable person all round. It is a beau-
tiful and edifying thing to see him wandering
through his constituency or bailiwick, or whatever
one calls that portion of the earth which is repre-
sented or ruled, or what not by an alderman. Wool-
loomooloo is where he reigns mostly, and there are
few of the local wharf laborers’ paws that he hasn’t
wrung, in the way of business, in his time. An in-
digenous superstition credits him with having person-
ally examined everv drain, kerbing and gutter in his
principality, with a view to the unearthment of de-
fects, and the swift rectification of the same.
There is a good article on “Aus-
tralian Life in the Forties” in De-
cember Cornhill, written by the
widow of Professor Huxley, the
famous fighting scientist— “Dar-
win’s Bull-dog,” as he was called
Mrs. Huxley, who is now 86
reached Sydney just before Christ-
mas, 1848, after a stormy voyage
of nearly six months from Eng-
land. At that time she was Miss
Heathorn, and with her parents
and sisters she journeyed per bul-
lock-dray to a farm in the Wol-
longong district. After a time
she joined a married sister in Syd-
ney. While she was on that visit
R.M.S. Rattlesnake arrived to
survey the Australian coasts.
Young Huxley was on board as
assistant surgeon. Miss Heathorn
met him at a Sydney dance; they
became engaged, and “a long anil
weary” wait was followed by “the
crowning gift of 40 years of happy
wedded life.”
In his lately-published autobi-
ography, Charles Gavan Duffy
gloats over the deposition of
O’Shanassy as Premier of Vic-
toria. By that time they were
ferocious enemies. Yet O’Shan,
had been foremost in welcoming
Duffy to Australia, and was a
prime agent in raising the £2OOO
which bought Dulfy his residence at Haw-
thorn. They became Ministers of State toge-
ther, O’Shan, as Premier, Duffy as Minister
for Lands, while Dick Ireland w T as Attorney-
General. With his Land Act of 1862, Duffy
was sincerely desirous of promoting settlement.
He thought Ireland cunningly frustrated it,
putting in loopholes to facilitate the awful
dummyism that resulted. O’Shanassy is
not likely to have had a hand in this. The
simple explanation of the row was that two
Irish lions roared along one small strip of
beach, and in time each began to think the
other a bellowing excrescence.
The well-gilded Ramaciotti, who added to
his heap of money while he was in the
J. C. Williamson firm, is spending some of
it in a way that ought to be greatly to the
advantage of Australia. He has been an en-
thusiastic Defence man for years, and
worked up to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel;
and, when he quitted the J.C.W. business
and sped out of Australia, it was chiefly
with the object of learning more about the
military business. Arriving in England in
June, he put in three weeks at Aldershot.
Passing over to Italy, he manoeuvred for
a fortnight with the Italian army, then did
Staff work for a month in Rome, and, when
last heard from, was attached to the Ist
Bersaglieri. In the spring he proposes to
go through their manoeuvres with the French
and Swiss armies. “Fairly hard work,” he
writes out to another Defence enthusiast,
“but enjoyable, and of extreme value.”
ANOTHER GLOOMY OUTLOOK.
Miss Ororoke was proceeding to her home when she
was attacked by a man, who attempted to snatch her
handbag. The girl, who is an athletic young woman,
promptly knocked the man down, jumped upon him,
and tore his coat off his back. Her dismayed assail-
ant fled before the police arrived on the seen e.— News

THE TOUGH : “This is the new woman fl-
yer. It ain't safe these days. Why, they'll
be doin' a man out of ’is own perfession."
John Yerran opened the S. Aus. political
campaign with a volley at Wallaroo. He
took a very comprehensive view of the situa-
tion, and 1400 persons took a very wide
view of him. They couldn’t do otherwise,
for John was never built for speed, and
Office has so deepened his chest that it
reaches nearly to his knees. He isn’t quite
the rough diamond of earlier days. But
there is plenty of the old John left, where-
fore nobody was surprised when, sitting
down after over two hours of carefully pre-
pared speech, he pulled a vast apple from
his pocket and chewed it leisurely, while the
usual vote of thanks was being discussed.
STARVATION OF THE BODY.
The fact that indigestion and constipation are
fruitful causes of organic diseases cannot be widely
known, or these only too common complaints would
not be neglected, as they are in nine cases out of 10.
“It is only indigestion’’ is a common remark, and
few realise that indigestion might be termed “starva-
tion of the body,” for food that is not digested is
not assimilated by the blood, and the body is not
properly nourished. Chamberlain’s Tablets will cure
the most obstinate ease of indigestion, and many a
long sufferer owes his present good health to a course
of Chamberlain’s Tablets.*

Mr. Labouchere was the possessor of a beautiful and
historic residence on the banks of the Thames —Pope’s
famous villa at Twickenham —and there he delighted
to have his friends. —S. M. Herald (18 /!/’ l2).
Some people “have” one on the turf,
And some on ’Change, or where
Pale lawyers wrangle ’neath a surf-
Like mass of frizzy hair.
Each grimy office in the town
Contains its little room
Where people have been “taken down,”
And plunged in rage and gloom.
One man, however, Labouchere,
Declined, ’twould seem, to roam.
He spurned convention’s icy stare
And “had” his friends at home.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
A prodigious amount of piffle is being
printed about the Commonwealth Bank and the sav-
ings business. The usual way of putting it is that
one of th’e new bank’s wicked functions will be “to
absorb the business of the savings banks of the re-
spective States.” “There is,” says the S. M. Herald,
whose wild language is typical, “no possible excuse
for the Commonwealth endeavoring to interfere with
State business in this respect.” This regard for
“State business” is very touching, especially when it
comes from those who, month after month, recently
fought the proposal to transfer to the State what is
known as the Barrack-street Bank in N. S. Wales —
a concern which doesn’t belong to the State, though
the State was expected to prop it up when some years
ago it looked like falling. The Savings Bank busi-
ness is, in fact, no more State business than the fire-
insurance business belongs to the fire offices already
in existence; yet, so far from throwing bricks at
new insurance concerns which have appeared, the
papers have smiled on them, and, patting them on
the back with one hand, have held out the other fist
for an advt. And though there are Comic Bits and
Funny Cuts in plenty, the Sydney Telegraph didn’t
recently say that the penny snippet business be-
longed to those who were already in it; on the con-
trary, it launched its own penny snippet. If the
Savings Bank business belongs to anybody in par-
ticular, it belongs to the people who have the best
facilities for carrying it on, and as it isn’t denied
that those facilities lie in the post office, obviously
the authority which owns the post office is, prima
facie, the authority with the best claim to the busi-
ness. Prime Minister Fisher knows, of course, what
the real trouble is. The State Governments are not
worrying about the poor depositors; they are worry-
ing about the poor Treasurers who have been in the
hahit of dipping into the Savings Bank till whenever
other people wouldn’t lend them the money, for a
financial jag. The Savings Banks have been to them
the bottle on the shelf, to which these Sarah Gamps
could put their lips whenever they felt disposed.
Fisher went so far as to recognise that little weak-
ness, and undertook to keep the bottle supplied, for
a term of years at least; but the Sarah Gamps have
developed a large appetite, and nothing will satisfy
them but the complete command of the cellar. That
is the whole trouble; the alleged regard for the poor
depositor is mere bluff.

Six months ago many of the shareholders turned
sourly away from the chairman’s speech. They had
been expecting a plum, in the shape of a new issue,
at either par or a very small premium, and they
didn’t get it. Probably the long-headed and exper-
ienced old gentlemen whose words carry most weight
said: “Wait till we see what the harvest is.” The
wool clip and the wheat harvest were not a failure,
anyway, so the plum is now to be handed out. The
present capital is £1,500.000 ; this is to be increased
to £1,750,000 by the issue of 20,000 new shares at
par—that is, £l2 10s. As Commercial of Sydney
shares have for many months stood at somewhere
about £32, this looks like a bonus of £l9 10s. per
new share; or, as six of the present shares will carry
one of the new issue, £3 ss. per old share. But that
isn’t quite the right way to put it, because for at
least a couple of years it has been obvious that, un-
less the deposits slumped very much, prudence would
demand a new issue. Hence, the shares have had an
inflated price. The position may be put this way:—
Six shares at £32 = £192. One ditto at £l2 10s.
Total for seven, £204 10s. Dividend on seven shares
at 10 p.c. per annum =£B 15s. =£4 ss. 6d. p.c.
on the purchase price. So the investor who has been
paying £32 for the shares gets only a shade over ii
p.c. on his money, notwithstanding that the plum
looks large and luscious. It is very doubtful whether
4i p.c. is a fair return to get from any bank stock.
It certainly isn’t, unless there is a reasonable expecta-
tion of more bonuses. And in that connection the
history of the past few years is not a reliable guide.
It is true that five years ago the capital was qnly
£1,000,000, and it is now proposed to put it up to
£1,750,000; but it was 10 years before the capital
was raised from £600,000 to £1,000,000, and for
the 10 years preceding that no new capital had been
got in at all. Many things, no doubt, influence a
bank in putting up its capital; but the chief thing
is the amount of public money (deposits, etc.) at
risk. To give creditors adequate protection, Aus-
tralian bankers, as a rule, think it unwise to have a
capital ( plus reserves) very much less than one-
seventh of the total of the liabilities. Owing to the
big Australian harvests of wool, wheat and mineral
of the last few years, people have been pouring money
into the banks. When bad seasons come, not only
will the inflow stop, but there will be an actual out-
flow. In 1890 the total average deposits of the Com-
mercial of Sydney in N. S. Wales for the last quarter
were £9,515,138, and of all the banks £35,460,118.
For the corresponding quarter of 1900 —10 years
later —the figures had shrunk to £9,158,321 and
£31,533,476. If this country could go on piling up
deposits year after year without a break, this bank
might also be expected to go on making rapid in-
crease after increase of its capital. But the thing
would be a miracle if it happened, and right in the
teeth of past experience.
Looking back over 10 years’ history, these extra-
ordinary results show up:—
Liabilities.
Dec.,1901. Dec.,1911.
Notes and bills.. £1.517,150 £1,411,898 Dec. 6'9p.c.
Deposits. ..11,976,614 20,948,705 1nc.74.9 „

Advances .. 9,360,088 13,762,776 Inc. 46.9 „
Premises.. .. 434,050 510,588 Inc. 17 6,,
The reduction in the notes and bills item is due to
the displacement of all other notes by those of the
Commonwealth. The bank has strengthened its posi-
tion greatly. Compare the 46 p.c. increase in ad-
vances with the 93 p.c. increase in liquid assets.
This bank, at any rate, seems to have no illusions on
the subject of the present abundance of money; it
seems to realise that, even if it can keep up the level
of its deposits—which is at least uncertain —the time
will come when some of its best customers will be
turning up for an overdraft instead of with a fixed
deposit. Meantime it keeps just over 50 p.c. of its
deposit money and other debts in a liquid state—
just in case it should be wanted.
In the past 12 months there have been these
changes:—•
Dec., 1910. .Dec., 1911.
Notes .. .. £631,538 £79,843 Dec. £551,695
Bills .. .. 1,320,467 1,332,055 Inc. 11,558
Deposits .. .. 19,622,848 20,948,705 Inc. 1,325,857
Liquid assets .. 12,563,173 11,207,796 Dec. 1,355,377
Advances .. 11,564,052 13,762,776 Inc. 2,198,724
Premises.. .. 487,455 510,588 Inc. 23,133
The very solid increase in advances is doubtless due
in a large measure to the cutting up of big estates
and the financing of new occupiers—not very risky
business, seeing that farming land always has a value,
and that at least 15 p.c. of the purchase money has
usually to be put up within a few months, so that at
most there is only 85 p.c. owing. Deposits and all
other liabilities total £22,360,602; so the bank has
£7 6s. of the public’s money for every £1 of its
own. The issue of the new capital will bring it
within the standard 7 to 1. Profits calculated on
capital and reserves combined don’t reach the dizzy
heights shown by some other very prosperous banks:
June, 1907 .. £6 13 3 p.c. Dec., 1909 .. £8 4 7 p.c.
Dec., 1907 .. 6 14 7 ~ June, 1910 .. 8 2 11 „
June, 1908 .. 7 5 7 „ Dec., 1910 .. 8 1 10 ~
Dec., 1908 .. 6 18 7 ~ June, 1911 .. 7 19 8 ~
June, 1909.. 7 9 0 „ Dec., 1911.. 7 19 10 „
The very big holding of liquid assets must, however,
be remembered ; but if they bring in a small return
there isn’t much danger of their melting away. And,
besides, one never knows how much unmentioned pro-
fit is being socked away in the shape of premises, etc.

The officers’ provident fund gets another £2OOO for
this last half-year, and that has been taken off the
profits. Of what remains, 74 p.c. is paid away iii
divs., leaving 26 p.c. available to lay by. In a time
of abnormal prosperity and high prices, 26 p.c. is on
the small side. For it is in such times that the bad
debts are made. Theoretically, a bank shouldn’t ever
make any; it ought always to have 20s. of security
for every £1 of advance. But Australia is a country
of pretty violent fluctuations. In the first place, it
depends so largely upon “the great primary indus-
tries,” and the great primary industries are as un-
certain as a prima donna’s temper. In 1899 the
N. S. Wales wool clip was worth £10,068,400, and
in 1900 it was worth only £7,676,800. In 1907 it
was worth £17,185,100, and in 1908 only
£12,680,000. As for wheat, the Commonwealth
production in 1900-1 was 48,353,402 bushels, and in
1902-3 only 12,378,068 bushels ; in 1903-4 74,149,634
bushels, and in 1907-8 only 44,655,673 bushels. A
country that depends mainly on wool clips and wheat
harvests, subject to such bumps as that, can’t fail to
have a bumpy existence itself. To intensify the ups
and downs the wool and wheat harvests are almost
invariably both good or both bad. And when they
are both good, and things are naturally inclined to
boom owing to the abundance of money, the Govern-
ments invariably rush out and borrow large sums —
often of foreign money—and scatter the coin, and
thus make the boom froth higher than ever. When
the 90 million bushel harvest suddenly slumps to one
of 15 millions, and Cohen turns a cold eye on further
borrowing, the bank’s 20s. security has a vicious
habit of being worth about 10s., unless it has been
carefully selected.
Fortunately, there is very little evidence that Aus-
tralian banks don’t realise this; and probably there
isn’t one of them that isn’t putting a bit up its
sleeve. All of them know that something is going to
fall presently; none of them know exactly what is
going to fall. So the wise ones are stuffing away
what may be called boom profits to provide for con-
tingeheies, in the hope that they presently won’t have
to make losses good out of visible reserves. But how
much any bank is stuffing away nobody knows who
isn’t in that bank’s inmost secrets. One can’t even
be sure that every bank is doing it. All that the in-
vestor can be quite sure about is that the present con-
ditions are such that Australian banks, unless they
are handled with extreme caution, are liable to be
laying the foundations for much bad debt. They
may, or again they may not, be making internal pro-
vision to meet the contingency.
Before the bank crisis, in the early ’9o’s, the Vic-
toria had a capital of £600,000; on reconstruction,
pref. capital, to the extent of £416,760, was issued
in part-payment of the debt to the depositors. The
present capital is as much as £1,478,010 ; and that
increase, of course, greatly .strengthens the position
of all creditors. The total liabilities are £7,563,308,
which means about £4 6s. for every £1 of capital
and reserves —a very safe proportion. Naturally,
having so comparatively little public money at risk
in proportion to capital and reserves, the profits cal-
culated on capital and reserves are not large. This
is the recent record: —
June, 1907 .. £5 5 4 p.c. Dec., 1909 ..£5 17 2 p.c.
Dec., 1907 .. 5 19 6 ~ June, 1910.. 5 15 10 „

June, 1909 .. 5 18 4 „ Dec., 1911.. 6 14 4 „
It would probably be even less than that if the co.
did not trade pretty well up to the limit; it has only
30 p.c. of its liabilities (deposits, etc.) represented
by liquid assets. This shows the position in detail: —

There has thus been a pretty big jump in advances
during the year. This new business may be quite
good ; but the high level of present values, and the
probable shrinkage presently in most securities, must
be kept in mind.
Taking a look back over 10 years we get these re-
sults :

The capital is quite big enough to stand all the in-
crease in liabilities; but a point as to which there
may be doubt, is whether it wouldn’t have been
better to have kept a tighter rein on the advances,
and thereby strengthened the liquid assets. Of the
capital, £416,760 is preferential, but the preference
ceases after these shares have received 7 p.c. in 10
half-years.

Ten years ago this little bank had £222,562 of de-
posits and £289,351 of advances; to-day, after a
run of good seasons, it has £251,354 of deposits and
£317,254 of advances, so the growth isn’t anything
to cheer about. It hasn’t any branches, and confines
itself wholly to Ballarat. Somebody said it was all
right to put your whole setting of eggs in one
basket provided you watched that basket. But
watching won’t do much good: you need to hold the
basket, and that’s just what you can’t always do.
For instance, all the watching in the world wouldn’t
have put gold into the exhausted Ballarat and Cres-
wick mines; and that is chiefly what is the matter
with Ballarat—that and the big-landlord disease. No
doubt, having the whole thing under its nose, the
bank can pretty well steer clear of bad debts; so if
there isn’t much in the way of profits, there shouldn’t
be much in the way of risks. Capital is £85,000,
and on that and reserves combined the earnings

The bank holds 40 p.c. of all its liabilities in

judge on figures, the position is exceptionally safe —
and exceptionally unexciting.

To understand the present position it is always neces-
sary to go back and rake over the ancient muck-heap
a little. When the old Queensland booming gang
had brought this bank to the verge of collapse, it
used the borrowing resources of the State to try to
prop the institution up ; in other words, when the
bank couldn’t borrow any more itself on satisfactory
terms, the State did the borrowing, and passed the
money on to the bank—nearly two millions of it.
Pursuant to a revised reconstruction scheme adopted
in 1897, both the State and private depositors under-
took to forego interest on one-fourth of their de-
posits ; the private depositors, moreover, agreed to
accept payment of their fourth out of future profits.
This fourth was accordingly written off, and appears
nowhere in the accounts —not even as a contingent
liability, though it certainly is one. William Kidston
made a further re-arrangement with the bank when
he was Premier, taking promissory notes for the
whole of the debt to the State. The bank had the
right to prepay these p.ns., and there are only four
that haven’t been disposed of, payable 1918-19-20-
21. The entire position, so far as the old debt is
concerned, is as follows: —

Until that £719,450 or thereabouts —the exact
amount isn’t ascertainable —has been paid off, or
until some other arrangement is made, the'bank has
been advised that it is barred from paying a divi-
dend. A question of much interest, therefore, is:
What progress is being made in paying this debt ?
The following may throw some light on that: —

A further 6d. will be paid next March. This will be
4s. provided in six years. In each of the past two
half-years £30,000 has been appropriated, and the
management evidently reckons upon being able to at
least keep that up, and £60,000 a year is about
Is. 2d. in the £. After the next 6d. is paid, there
will remain 14s. to pay; and if £30,000 can be ap-
propriated each half-year, the whole debt will be
wiped out in 12 years. The future must tell whether
that much or more can be spared for the purpose.
The bank’s new deposits, being a first charge, are
so well protected that there has evidently been no
difficulty in getting new money for new advances.
This shows the chief movements in 10 years:—

Premises 278,664 288,841 295,763
As good a feature as any is the complete disappear-
ance of the item, “Private ledger accounts.” These
were always understood to be very dubious assets in-
deed ; but either they have been written down so hard
out of profits, or they have recovered so much in
value, that they have now been disposed of without
further loss. If they have been written down, it
means that the profits thus hitherto employed are
available now for other purposes ; while, if they have
improved in value, it speaks very hopefully for all
the old assets. The deposits haven’t grown much in
bulk during the year, but that is only because the
Government deposit account has been drawn upon for
just over half a million ; and the same circumstance
explains most of the shrinkage in liquid assets. Yet
even now the liquid assets are extraordinarily strong;
they amount to 36 p.c. of the entire liabilities, in-
cluding the interminable stock (old private de-
posits). The bank could do a million more in ad-
vances if the right .securities were available. This re-
straint looks well.
If Queensland does even fairly well, and if no poli-
tical or other accident happens, the time will come
when Q.N. shareholders will be in clover. The capi-
tal is only £413,484, in £5 shares, paid to £3;
and, though there is a preferential capital of
£3,091,669, the latter carries only 34 p.c. This
pref. capital will, of course, justify the bank in tak-
ing and using far more deposit money than it other-
wise could prudently do; already the new deposits,
etc., amount to over £ll for every £1 of the share
capital. Certainly, in the event of that money, or
part of the interminable three millions odd, being
lost, the reserves and share capital will be first
drawn upon to make it good ; and there is a big risk
in that. But, in return for taking that risk, all the
surplus profits will belong to the shareholders.

Compared with other trustee cos., this pioneer in the
business has a very big capital; its lot is £90,000,
while the two important concerns doing similar busi-
ness in N. S. Wales have been getting along very well
on £25,000 apiece, with a big amount uncalled. The
size of the paid capital doesn’t seem to affect the
volume of a trustee Co.’s business very much; pro-
bably not one client in a. dozen Who isn’t also a share-
holder could say what amount the shareholders have
dropped into the till as a guarantee that the co.
won’t skip to Callao, or rhisread its instructions, and
so lose trust money, or do any other thing that an
honest and competent trustee shouldn’t do. But
though it apparently doesn’t make much difference to
the business profits whether the paid'- capital is
£90,000 or £25,000, it makes a lot of difference to
the rate of dividend when those profits come to be cut
up ; and that explains why this co., in spite of the
fact that it has a bigger value of estates in hand
than any other trustee co. in Australia, pays only 7
p.c., while others no better conducted pay 10 p.c.
In consideration of its big capital or guarantee fund*
it might be justified in dividing a big whack of its
profits; but it doesn’t do anything at all extravagant
in that way; and there is every reason to believe also
that it doesn’t draw too heavily on its corpus com-
missions. It is through those commissions that a
trustee co. can put on its profits almost whatever face
it pleases—for a brief time, of course. The annual
commission of 2$ p.c. on the income from a £30,000
estate only brings in about £37 10s. a year; but
the 24 p.c. chargeable once on the gross capital value
of the estate means £750. The co. that drops that
£750 into profit as soon as the estate comes into its
hands, will bulge the profits for that term ; but the
chances are that the £37 10s. a year, which it will
get thereafter, won’t pay the actual costs of admin-
istration. Scarcely a trustee co. tells how it deals
with the £750; and that destroys most of the value
of such cos.’ accounts. The only serviceable thing to
do is to consider the results over a fairly long span
of years. A general survey of this co. shows that,
while profits are irregular, they are at the least well
maintained; and a 7 p.c, div. or more has been
earned in every half-year in the past decade. Ten
years ago the total value of the trust estates in hand
was £6,569,543; it is now £9,314,730. Though
the profits vary, they have lately averaged 2s. sd. p.c.
of the capital value of the estates. The average pro-
fits nowadays should, therefore, be about £3400
p.a. better than those of 10 years back. Moreover,
though with a slump in property values the corpus
commission would also shrink, the volume of trustee
business done by this and other professional trustee
cos. may be reasonably expected to grow steadily.

This co. owns the fine premises crowned by a
bronze lady who for years past has been hailing a
ferry at Circular Quay without getting any for’arder
with the business. The buildings, including the pub
tucked away at the rear, stand in the books at
£69,750. They have- stood at £70,000 for so long
that the change comes as a shock. Property there-
abouts certainly hasn’t been wilting of late; but pro-
bably the co. concludes that even Hawkesbury sand-
stone won’t last for ever, and that it is a fair thing
to strike £250 off the value for a start. At any
rate, the item has come down that much ; and, though
£250 worth may have been sold, it is far more likely
that that much has been written off profits as a set-
off against the natural decay of the asset. The capi-
tal is £30,000; and, as reserves amount to only
£18,753, it is plahi that somebody else’s money is
also in the premises. The necessary £20,000 or so
to make up the £69,750, is represented by deben-
tures. Considering the very fair size of the reserves,
the profits are extremely moderate; but the Exchange
isn’t wholly a money-grubber, and, anyway, the
security is just about as unimpeachable as city real
estate knows how to be.

Melbourne is invited to put up the modest
£lO,OOO required by the promoters of the Photo.
Vista Film Production Co. The vendor syndicate has
already started the business of producing Australian
scenic and other films for home and foreign con-
sumption, and it makes out a very good case for ex-
pecting a big increase in business. Australia greedily
takes the scenic films of other countries, and drama-
tic films with a foreign setting, and the promoters
seem to be on safe ground when they assume that
other countries will do the same if offered Australian
films. The proposition is speculative, but is well
worth considering.

The Derwent and Tamar Insurance Co.,
doing 1 fire and marine business, has now permitted
itself to be swallowed by a British co. with a brass-
nlate in these parts. The co. is the oldest in Australasia,
having been formed in 1838, and it has throughout
maintained its head-office in Hobart. For some time
oSt it has shown very little enterprise, and its pre-
miums are actually less now than 10 years
ago. Still its business has been profitable, and a 16
pTc. dividend has been paid of late. However, it is
old and weary, and when a co. comes along and
offers it £2 16s in cash, it seems that it has so
much of the miser in it that it can’t resist the chance
to hear the coin jingle. Yet, if its assets are what
it says they are, it is giving the business away, in-
asmuch as £2 16s. per share will oniy mean
£l4O 000; and in October last its surplus of assets
over liabilities was £132,341, after providing for
the current dividend. Altogether it is a poor bar-
gain - *.
Mechanical concentration is generally
wasteful; but, with the flotation process added, there
isn’t very much thrown on to the dumps now at
Broken Hill. The ore fed into the Sulphide Corpora-
tion’s lead mill last year averaged ll.loz. silver, 16.3
p.c. lead, and 17.3 p.c. zinc. After it had gone
through the lead mill, and what was left had passed
on to the zinc mill, the residues were worth 2.30 z.
silver, 2.3 p.c. lead, and 4.6 p.c. zinc. This shows it
in another way:—
Silver, Lead, Zinc,
oz. tons. tons.
In Ore .. .. 2,530,075 37,046 ' 39,666
In Residues .. 260,469 2,626 5,245
Extracted 2,269,606 34,420 34,421
Unfortunately, this doesn’t mean that the co. gets
paid full price for all the “extracted” metal. Thus,
there were 3842 tons of zinc in the lead concentrates
(8.8 p.c. zinc) ; and it is no good there. And in the
zinc concentrates there were: —
Total Contents. Assay Value.
Silver .. .. 1,050,546 oz. 14’7 oz.
Lead .. .. 7,782 tons 10'9p.c.
Zinc .. .. 30,579 „ 42'7 „
And you can’t get full value for any of those metals,
because you can’t get them all out. A de-leading
process is now working on the zinc concentrates;
and that makes the third stage in the long process of
metal-extraction. First, the ore goes into the lead
mill, which divides it into two parts—(l) silver-lead
concentrates; (2) zinc “tailings.” The silver-lead
concentrates go on to the lead-smelting furnaces; the
resulting silver-lead bullion goes on to the refinery,
where the silver and the lead are separated. The zinc
“tailings” go on direct to the zinc mill, whose feature
is oil-acid flotation; and here again there is a separa-
tion into two products—(l) zinc concentrates ; (2)
residues. The contents of the zinc concentrates were
mentioned above. Being so rich in lead, it wouldn’t
be profitable to send them straight to the zinc fur-
naces or retorts; so there is a third stage—the de-
leading process. That once more separates the con-
centrates into two products—(l) lead concentrates,
low in zinc; (2) zinc concentrates, low in lead. The
lead concentrates go to the lead furnaces; the zinc
to the spelter works. It is a long and elaborate busi-
ness; but as much as possible'of it is done automati-
cally. Costs at the Sulphide Corporation work out
as follows:
Per ton.
s. d.
Mining .. .. .. • • 12 11
Development .. .. • • 14
Lead concentration .. .. .. 6 5
Zinc concentration . . . . . . 7 1
The zinc concentration is per ton of “tailings” fed
into that mill—not per ton of original ore. The
bulk of the silver-lead smelting is done in Australia;
but this co. now exports its zinc concentrates, and
Europe has the highly profitable job of producing the
metallic spelter. #
The Ore Concentration Co., which owns
the Elmore flotation patents, held its annual meeting
in London lately, and naturally all the talk was about
the litigation with the Sulphide and Zinc Corpora-
tions. Things haven’t gone well, so far, with the El-
more people; “but,” said the chairman, “if we lose,
we shall only have lost under the one special patent
which we have claimed infringement of, and will still
be in a position to start a new suit under other
patetits.” Other shareholders agreed that “the only
policy to adopt was to back up our patents to the
very last penny we have” ; so Costs is evidently in
for a good time.

The Grampians Dredging Co., yyhich oper-
ates at Vegetable Creek (N.S.W.), has so far suffered
from bad luck or something. Dredging began in
February, 1911. Scarcity of water was the first
trouble; the second was a flood, in which the dredge
was washed out. Floating operations occupied about
a month, since when dredging has gone on spasmodi-
cally, with frequent intervals for repairs to dredge
and dam, the latter having a nasty habit of breaking
away at awkward times. These troubles have resulted
in numerous changes, but not much better luck.
Gundagai, one of the Ma State’s most
tantalising fields, is again dangling a baited hook
in front of the public’s eyes. The jeweller’s shop
this time is in the Long Tunnel, into which Rice and
party pushed their way a couple of years ago to
clean out and open up some old workings. The find
was made at 280 ft.; 86 tons from the rich patch
gave 3070 z., and then a few dishes of quartz dollied
2720 z. The usual yarn is told that this extraordin-
ary development clearly proves that the mine is im-
proving with depth. What it does prove is that
Gundagai is the same old Gundagai that it was
when the Prince of Wales Co. gave it a long* trial.
“Underlay” : The one N.S.W. field where
mining is regularly done for platinum is at Fifield.
Here a lead has been worked in patches for a length
of over two miles, and a width of as much as 200 ft.
When this lead was first worked for platinum in 1892,
the metal was sold locally for from 14s. to 16s. per
oz. Two and a half years ago it brought £2 17s. 6d.
per oz. ; then another market was found, and the
price rose to £3 15s. per oz. Twelve months ago
another buyer offered £4 if the miners would guar-
antee him up to lOOoz. They agreed, and completed
the verbal contract, although they were offered more
money meanwhile. Last year the price steadily rose,
until Christmas week saw it up to £5 7s. 6d., and
during' the holidays the local buyer offered *.6,
which is the present price. Whether the Russian
output has been decreasing during the last year or
two, thus affecting the market, I don t know, but the
fact that buyers are competing for the output is sig-
nificant. During the last few years an average of
about 15 men have been making a living out of the
lead. The sinking is from 40ft. to 60ft., and the
washdirt averages about 6in. thick. It is puddled
by machine, at a cost of 3s. 6d. per load, the yields
going from 3oz. to Boz. per mill of 12 loads lhe
general run of it is about 4oz. per mill. The bottom
is very good driving. The miners take it in benches,
gouging under the wash about 2ft., and then gad-
ding and picking the stuff down. After the opening-
up work has been done, one man will break hall a
load per day. It was in 1889 that the lead was
prospected by Connolly Bros, and Smith, who worked
for gold with Government aid, cutting the lead in
three different places with shafts and drives, they
obtained good prospects of platinum; but, taking it
for native silver in minute quantities, they threw it
away. It was not until three years later that Smith,
having found out what the white metal was, came
back and started work on the lead, which is now
called Platina. For a distance of over two miles
platinum and gold are to be found at or near the
surface, with here and there streaks of wash, but
these deposits are only occasionally payable, though
some very good patches have been obtained, there
are dredging possibilities here. Also, the individual
miner has a chance, not only along the old lead, but
further out; for there is tin to be had as well as the

If the Ivyloe (N.S.W.) report means
what it says, the mill is doing amazingly good work.
Thus: “At the ore-dressing mill regular work was re-
sumed on Monday, January 8, and the mill ran 119
hours, treating 248 tons of 5.5 p.c. ore. From the
picking belt four tons of prill, assaying 20.1 p.c.,
were removed to the bagging sheds; 39 tons 4ewt.
of jig concentrates, containing 8 tons 2cwt. oi
copper, and 19 tons lOcwt. of flotation concentrates,
containing 4 tons 9cwt. of copper, were bagged tor
despatch.” Ore treated, 248 tons, worth 5.5 p.c.;
that means 13 tons 13cwt. metal. Recovery was 16cwt.,
plus 8 tons 2cwt., plus 4 tons 9cwt.; total, 13 tons
7ewt. If this plant can get 13 tons 7cwt. out of a
possible 13 tons 13cwt., and do it at a reasonable
cost, it ought to turn the eyes of every poor copper
gouger in Australia towards the oil-acid flotation
process. *
Westralia paid out £98,609 in gold divi-
dends during December ; total for the year, £822,072 ,
total since the industry started, £22,173,473.
* * *
Bullfinch Prop. (W.A.) has finally de-
cided to treat its ore by wet crushing, fine grinding,
filtering, etc., and to drive the whole show with
electric motors. Most of the required plant has been
ordered, and, all doing well, Doolette and Co. hope to
have it running in August. Another lev%l (the
third) has been started at 310 ft., and as rich ore was
found on the 210 ft. level in every spot where the sul-
phides were exposed, it is confidently expected that
the lode at 310 ft. will prove all right. The public
which dropped its bundle, the Government which built
the railway, the unhinged individuals who gave fancy
prices for town lots—in fact, everyone except those
who specked and are still “out” of the shares, fer-
vently hopes so. # *
In a report just to hand, Cosmopolitan
Prop. (W.A.) sighs over its reduced circumstances,
and expresses a hope that its luck will turn some
dav. A few years ago this co. was very affluent, ana
between 1900 and 1906 paid £129,000 in dividends.
Then the mine went wrong at depth, and the evi-
dence is all against it ever getting right again.
Work on the co.’s account was discontinued some
time ago, and portions of the property were let on
tribute. Since then about £4500 has been raked in
from the treatment of old residues and from tnbut-
ing, but most of it has been mopped up in office
exes., etc. This sort of thing will probably continue
until the exes, get into arrear, when no doubt the co.
will lie down and die. # *
Everything that could be done was done
to make shareholders cheerful at the Kalgurli meet-
ing ; but, although the chairman did his best, the
mine is in so unsatisfactory a state in the bottom
that he did not succeed. Still, the property will
figure high up on the producing list for years, but
the shrivelling of dividends, which started a year
ago, looks like continuing. #
Keen disappointment is expressed in the
annual report of the London, Australian and General
Exploration, Ltd., at the wretched results obtained
from the co.’s Australian holdings, owing, it is alleged,
to the difficulty of securing suitable labor and the
high cost of working. The Lancefield and Northern
mines (W.A.) are mentioned as having suffered
acutely. During the year the former yielded
£140,578, and the latter £98,652, but in each case
no surplus remained after providing for development
and capital expenditure. Many Australian properties
were considered, but were turned down after exten-
sive examination. As a result of fortunate specula-
tions elsewhere—at Maikop and Porcupine—the co.
shows a surplus for the year of £27,246, after pro-
viding for management and exploration. Having re-
gard for the general fall in market prices during the
last six months, provision has been made for depre-
ciation to the extent of £25,000. Present cash re-
sources (including the uncalled liability on certain
shares) are declared to equal the market valuation
of the co.’s scrip.
* * * *
In a letter to the Ivanhoe directors, last
month, manager Nicolson said that there appeared
to be no reason why the present rate of profit (about
£lB,OOO per month) should not be maintained dur-
ing the current year.
° * * * *
Ingliston Extended (W.A.) states that
last year’s operations resulted in a surplus of £4730.
Depreciation of plant, etc., has been deducted from
this, leaving a balance of £3272. The debentures
outstanding at June 30, 1910, totalled £3500, but
all of this has since been repaid. The overdraft has
also been wiped off, and the co.’s property at Meeka-
tharra is now free from debt. In order to provide
funds for additional machinery and development, the
capital was lately increased by the creation of 5000
additional £1 shares, all subscribed for at par.
* * * *
The mines that scored the best dividends
at Charters Towers last year were New Brilliant
Freehold, 6s. per share (£45,000); East Mexican,
ss. 6d. (£33,962); Mills’ United, 2s. (£30,000).
All these three were working the Day Dawn forma-
tion —which, having so many branches, and cross-
veins, is really a network. Only 20 p.c. of the field s
dividends for the year came from outside the Day
Dawn The rival Brilliant is, however, now coming
rapidly to the front again, the most important de-
velopments being the run of good stone in the Bril-
liant Deeps, and the improvement in the Brilliant
Extended’s No. 20 eastern hanging-wall level—the
latter a healthy bit of news, because the Extended,
as a pioneer of deep levels at 2850 ft., has hitherto
had noor luck.
Mount Elliott (Q.) strike is off, and, as
far as appearances go, so is the Hampden amalgama-
tion. It is doubtful whether either Hampden or
Elliott is very anxious to have the tape-measure run
over its extractable reserves, Elliott especially. That
amalgamation on fair terms would be a good thing
is, however, pretty clearly proved by the fact that
Hampden has given up the poor job of turning its
rich ore into low-grade matte, and, instead, is ship-
ping the stuff direct to the Elliott furnaces.
Thompson’s Oaks (N.Q.) has 24 acres
and 150,000 issued shares, so the 24 acres have a stiff
job in front of them. In sinking the main shaft a
reef was passed through, and a trial lot of 100 tons
will go through a neighbor’s battery within the next
week or two. That crushing will be worth watching,
though it ought to be accompanied by an assurance
that the stuff hasn’t been picked at all. The reef
was 4ft. wide where met, but it varies considerably
both in size and value. At the bottom of an under-
lay winze, put down on the lode, the face was 2ft.
6in. wide, and in that 14ft. values have run from
over £5O down to about £5 a ton. The co. has a
few hundreds in hand, and the crushing ought to
make the financial position easy for a while.
Ballarat, during the December quarter, put
up a poor record, with 51870 z. won and £l4OO paid
in divs. Men employed have dwindled down to 800,
almost all of whom work in Ballarat East. Out of
436 stampers, only 227 are falling, and the worst is
there is no immediate prospect of a change. Ballarat
is always careful not to give the tonnage dealt with,
thinking the figures will frighten speculators away,
whereas it is the absence of such facts that keeps sen-
sible men aloof from the field.
New Langi Logan, Ararat (Vic.), is not
out of the verdant stage —work is in the green rock
that precedes green wash, and generally co-ordinates
with a green market. Present strongest symptoms
are a tendency to delirium over the result of wash
bores. The public is ready to swallow almost any-
thing the gentle market manipulator may suggest.
At such times it is little use administering caution
tablets of the sort that King has given to British
Broken Hill optimists. The first Langi Logan
bore, by running through green rock into a blank,
ought to have reduced the fever, especially as the
yarn had gone round that it would rip into rich
wash. This miss meant sending the under level ahead
200 ft., putting in a cross drive, and providing locks
to reduce the risk of a burst of water and slum.
Notwithstanding that cold douche, the faithful still
expect a £2 market for shares on a prospect of gold
from bores. The mine would then stand in the mar-
ket at £200,000. For a claim on a lead into which
a pick has never been put, this is a tough price,
especially as there is that loan of £6OOO or £BOOO
to be repaid to the North Langi Logan, with 12 or
18 months of calls ahead to meet costs of pumping
and entering the wash. #
“Wash good and water light,” was
the report concerning the No. 1 bore of the Cath-
cart Central (Vic.), and now No. 2 has punched into
light wash, giving colors of gold, with “water
fair.” This switch-on of the water bugbear has
switched off the market enthusiasm for the time
being, especially as nobody knows exactly what good
wash” means. The co. hit some rubbly quartz in its
first bore, and looked for a leaven of the same
material in its No. 2, but had to go without any
self-raising flour of the kind. Cathcart has declared
another shilling div., but as it has only £2200 left
on current account and deposit, there won t be much
stiffening for Centrals from that quarter till manager
Bryant starts panelling at No. 3 shaft.
* * * *
Every winter used to see All Nations a
happy little gamble to cheer every fireside in Wood’s
Point (Vic.). Now there is no relief from call-pay-
ing, spring, summer, winter or autumn. Six months
have just been spent in testing Lawson’s reefs, be-
tween the All Nations and Lawson’s tunnels; but
rising, winzing and driving only show that b°th the
shoot of gold and the reef are narrow and poor at
depth as shoots and reefs so often are at Wood s
Point. Only a third of the shares on the register are
alive to face the responsibility of testing the eastern
workings, where some decent prospects help to keep
the spark of life just flickering.* *
New Moon, Bendigo, is in a cloudy sky.
The present co. began to pay regular divs. in 1892,
six years after it took things over from the old co.,
and it hasn’t been out of the list in any year since. Its
best record was in 1894, when £2 a share was paid;
last year, mainly through the gleanings of tributors,
it managed 3s. On a capital of £12,000 the co. has
paid £353,400; and it’s things like that that send
Bendigo’s hand to its pocket on call days. Ihe bot-
tom workings, down to 2425 ft., hold out no bright
promises, and it is to the spurs in the upper work-
ings and the Paddy’s Gully line that the sharehomers
are looking now. Fortunately the co. has about
£3500 tucked by, and there’s always a trifle to be
done for the public at the battery.
So far as the Paddy’s Gully line is concerned, New
Moon doesn’t get much encouragement from its stable
mate, New Argus. “Operations down to 480 ft. have
not uncovered anything payable. There is a fine
show of reef country,” says old battler George H.
Green, the chairman, “but it is wanting in the essen-
tial quality.” So the gold nowadays has to come out
of the shareholders’ pockets—and the “sale of shares
that figures in the accounts tells of tired shareholders,
in spite of the co.’s record of £126,000 in divs.
After a muck-needed stope filling and
timbering campaign, Mount Lyell is gradually get-
ting into its old stride. It is estimated that the rise
in wages will cost £20,000 a year, or (say) Is. per
ton if the works are run up to their full capacity.
Costs may thus climb to 21s. per ton of crudes; but
even so, assuming that for years ahead the average
recovery is to be two units of fine copper, together
with ss. worth of precious metals, the total, with
copper at £6O, will be 245. for copper and ss. for
precious metals = 295. per ton, won at a cost of 21s.
A 2 p.c. average will make blister cost £52 lUs. ,
but the metal contents will total £72 10s., leaving
a comfortable margin of £2O per ton of blister.
Mount Bischoff’s output for the last quar-
ter of the year was 280 tons of tin oxide. The divs.
declared for the last three months mount up to
£lB,OOO, so the profit was over £64 per ton ot
oxide —-which is more than the metal brought for
many years. The co. is in clover while the tin
boom lasts; but the market is tricky, and the quicker
those 3,000,000 tons of ore in reserve are rushed out
the better. »

P P Cook’s McArthur River Explora-

M.L.G.: You say this paper is incon-
sistent because, having once attacked the Citizens for
feeding the Ordinary branch at the expense of the In-
dustrial, it now regrets that the National Mutual
missed its chance to establish an Industrial branch to
feed its Ordinary business. There’s no inconsistency
about it. This paper doesn’t now suggest that the
National Mutual should have fed its Ordinary branch
at the expense of the Industrial policy-holders. What
it does say is that it is easier to get Industrial policy-
holders than Ordinary policy-holders, and that, hav-
ing got a man to take an Industrial policy, and keep
it for a while, an office is in a good position to pass
him on to the Ordinary branch. In short, an Indus-
trial branch, though it gives poor results in itself, is
of value to the office and the community as an in-
surance kindergarten; for which reason The Bulle-
tin has affirmed that no office should be permitted to
do Industrial business unless it also has an Ordinary
branch, to the superior advantages of which it should
be obliged to draw attention on every document
issued to the Industrial policy-holder H.A.W.:

Professor Richards, in the revised edition of his
celebrated edition of “Ore Dressing,” 1909, devotes
14 pages to the Wilfley concentrating table, and,
among other things, remarks (p. 1465): “The first
table sold was installed in the Puzzle Mill, at
Breckenridge, Colorado. Since then over 12,000
have been sold. This machine has revolutionised
ore-dressing, and as such is a phenomenal success.
The original form and forerunner of all modern
shaking tables with longitudinal riffles. .. .has been
greatly improved.” And further on (p. 1478) re-
marks: “One feature of the Wilfley table to which
especial attention should be called is its ability to
separate sands from slimes while making the ordinary
concentration. This separation is more complete
and thorough than can be made by any classifier,
and should be taken advantage of in designing
mills.” In the last extensive additions made to the
treatment plant at the Golden Horseshoe Mine,
W.A., a large number of Wilfley Table Concentra-
tors were installed. The Austral Otis Engineering
Company, Limited, South Melbourne, have the sole

WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, Januaby 22, 1912.
My Dear Arini, —
The peaceful Japanese invasion of this
hamlet was accompanied by volleys of light
refreshments and deafening rounds of soft-
soap. We are some miles away from the
Jap wave which trickled over Thursday
Island a few years ago. A man who admits
he dodged some of last week’s heathen
gatherings tells me that anyone who’s been
in a land where the early-rising Jap is on
top, lias lost his enthusiasm for Nippon and
its flowers and its heavenly kimono. “In
Thursday Island, a few years ago (I only
passed through that variegated spot by the
way), the Japs, who then formed the bulk
of the population took all the sidewalk, when
there was a sidewalk, and the occasional
white man had to make way for them or
fight them. Perhaps the rougher-type pagan
is nearer to his national traditions than
the polished Asiatic, cased in modern naval
frills. But the Jap who used to edge the
European off the path up north, bore a
strong family likeness to the unsmiling bar-
barians who soaked the night-clothes of the
Queen of Korea in kerosene. A wood-heap
and a lighted match finished that misunder-
standing.”
When the Jap cruisers, Aso and Soya,
were here about two years ago, they gave
away paper flowers, and other equally-suit-
able symbols of their eternal friendship, to
the womenkind of this city. They also
rigged up various side-shows, at their after-
noon tea and saki party on the Jap flagship.
Their recent visit was garnished with the
same Asiatic arts. The single-stick perform-
ance—a bamboo cousin to fencing with the
foils on —had a glint of. heathen humor shed
upon it by a report in the daily press. This
brown feat of arms occurred between two
Japs at the Royal Naval House. When
the mock combat was over, a Jap officer-
doubtless Petty Officer Malaprop—proudly
remarked: “The soul of the Samurai was
contracted by means of this sport in ancient
times.”
Mildred Fry, M.A., and her sister Edith,
B.A. (of Manly), signalled “All’s well”
from Adelaide on their way to the Land of
Grey Skies and Wintry Winds. Mildred,
who s still on the sunny side of 30, snatched
, de S r( ;e at the precocious age of 18.
She s going to represent the secondary
schools of N.S.W. at the coming congress
of pedagogues in London. Edith, the
younger, 8.A., will plank her easel down in
foreign parts during the larger half of her
year, abroad, and chase Art in a Parisian
studio. Landscape and still life are the
Manly girl’s chief weapons of attack.
Mrs. Edgeworth David, of this town, is
picking up, in Hobart, some careless strands
of health that went astray last year, and
records good results. Daughter Molly, who’s
been sampling Britain’s rainfall and an
Edinburgh Sabbath, with brisk jaunts
through Continental languages, flutters
back to the Sydney home nest in March.
Rid Sophia, of great fame in Tarawera
(M.L.), lived long enough to brood in gloomy
foreboding over the death of her son.
He made his sad, dark brown exit on his
way with the unlucky Maori troupe to Eng-
land, and the brown tattooed mind, full of
superstitious fears, became “pourri,” or des-
pondent at this bad omen. Poor old pic-
turesque Sophia never really enjoyed her
dried shark again. Between her and her
younger, sharper rival, guide Maggie Papa-
kura, there was no relationship, but an
ancient hostility and a veiled cat-chorus of
anger.
Five years or so ago, Sophia, even then as
straight as a flagpole, tramped with me over
the smouldering fires of Whakarewarewa
Her tall, gaunt figure, dark, chiselled fea-
tures, sombre eyes, and frankly Maori out-
look, were picturesque remnants of the past
She cared nothing for the drop of white
blood in her veins, and was pure Maori in
her sympathies. She served up the legends
of her tribe (with heavy embroidery), and
let loose a ton or two of scathing comment
on the Maori who “pretended to be a
pakeha” (white man). How much of the
Arawa fist, which distributed black eyes at
the Maori welcome home the other day is
mixed up with the departed Sophia’s ven-
detta, deponent knoweth not.

A slip of a girl, Dorothy aßeckett Terrell
who lives in the Great Fog, recently caught
the judge’s eye and cantered off with a £250
prize. Cassell’s publishing firm held out
this glittering bait to the writer of the best
serial story for girls. The winner has a
splash of ink in her heredity, for her great-
grandfather was Gilbert a’Beckett, one of
the founders of London Punch. The story,
“Sister-in-Chief,” which is now meandering
through the Girls’ Realm, is handled with
skill for a youngster, though the inevitable
English vicar’s family (large, high-spirited
and inclined to kick over the traces of the
Shorter Cathechism) forms the peg of the rather
conventional drapery. The girl’s success in
getting away with the solid sum of £250 in
the early days, when she is only an inkling,
so to speak, rather than a full-grown inky-
wayfarer, has brought her forward with • a
rush, as a young person on a good wicket.
Sir John Nutting, now in Australia seek-
ing health, and looking up the captain-son
who is on the staff of Governor Denman, is
in the beer business, being head of the firm
of E. and J. Burke, who bottle Guinness’s
stout for export. Sydney has long been con-
nected roundaboutly with the same brand, the
late Chief Justice Darley having been a
grandson of the boss of the Guinness firm.
A wedding that happened at Christ
Church, in Moss Vale, the other day, recalled
the earliest moments of the high-toned dis-
trict. The bride was Miss Eileen Estella,
youngest daughter of the late P. H. Throsby,
of Redbraes, a descendant of that first Mrs.
Throsby, who, as a little girl Broughton,
was rescued from the Maoris a hundred years
since by Alexander Berry, after the his-
toric massacre. The ’groom, who scarcely
counts in these matters, was A. J. S. Lind-
say, of Adelaide.
Mr. Henry Osborne, whose engagement to
Miss Marjorie Lord was announced the other-
day, has retired to a hospital to have his
appendix removed. First his heart, now his
appendix! The carelessness of the modern
young man is amazing.
Mrs. Arthur Macarthur was swept out to
sea, at Manly, last week, and was towed
ashore ultimately in an apparently
drowned condition. The business of restor-
ing animation was forthwith entered upon
by the local life-saving club. It is a moot
question whether it is better to be drowned
outright, or to be saved and brought to on a
beach which is seldom inhabited by less than
two or three thousand people.
The Rainauds, who were burned out of
La Corniche recently, have trailed sadly
back to their old stand at Bayview. All
their fascinating French plate, cutlery, etc.,
went up in smoke on that disastrous occa-
sion. In fact, practically nothing was left
to them barring their ability to cook. The
Bayview place is where Lord Dudley and a
party of his, had to wait two hours one
Sunday, owing to the vast crowd of feeders
that monopolised the luncheon tables.
From a male acquaintance:—
All the late Henry Labouchere’s vast wealth goes
to his only child, the Princess Rudini. I remember
her as Dora Labouchere, a small, precocious child,
years ago, at the Bellevue, Cadenabbia. Labby visited
the Italian lakes every summer before passing on to
Milan and Florence. People used to say that his
daughter was the only human being he cared about.
Anyhow, he let her do and say what she liked.
Those were the days of table d’hote meals for all
hands, rich and poor, the expensive d la carte
system not having penetrated outside cities like
Paris, Vienna, etc. Labby and his child sat opposite
us. In the heat and fray of dinner one night a stout
American woman grabbed a passing waiter, and
clamored for “lemonard gazooze.” The man ap-
peared bewildered. “She means ‘limonade gazeuse,’
waiter,” said the Labouchere infant kindly, in the
shrill tones of childhood. Labby was delighted, but
the lady from the U.S. looked as though she would
have liked to reward the child’s well-meant effort
with a hearty slap. Miss Labouchere’s prince turned
out the worst of bad eggs, and she has lived apart
from him for years. One sees her referred to in the
London papers, by the way, as “beautiful.” It is
absurd. She is short and stocky, and the possessor
of an indifferent complexion—the antithesis of the
Princess of Suburbia’s dreams. Her strong suit has
always been her wit, social sense and'brains—which
latter she gets from both sides of her family. Hen-
rietta Hodson, her mother, was esteemed by good
judges to be a brilliant woman as well as a useful
actress. However, these things didn’t prevent her
marriage with Labby being a rank failure.
“Maorilander” drops in with a romance of
the ink-pot:—
Veteran Henry Brett, of the Auckland Star,
started many years ago as a comp, on a small news-
paper effusion in Hastings (Eng.). Then he turned
his face to the Maori Isles, and did some smart work
as a shipping reporter on an Auckland evening
paper. After this, Brett and C. M. Reid, once a
Presbyterian parson, and later a leader writer on a
Sydney daily, joined together as newspaper pro-
prietors. Reid had a pen with a “bite” in it, and
the partners were not in accord in this matter, for
Brett was not a hard biter by nature. They agreed
to separate. Each put in a tender for the proprie-
torship of the Auckland Star. Brett’s offer was ac-
cepted, and after that he sailed along in smooth seas
to affluence. Reid struck a less promising location,
and pulled his journalistic boat against the stream
without getting to the gilded harbor that Brett had
attained so easily.
Organist Lilian Frost sends a coo-ee from
the southern fringe of Australasia, on the
Ancient Way to London. The Sydney
musician’s fingers will skip over the key's
of various organs during her stay in the
overcrowded city of Bullville. She will
also extend a white caressing hand to the
music pipes that peal in sundry Parisian
churches.
Is Andrew Higginson getting weary of
stage love-making, or did the weather-beaten
“Miss Gibbs” finally knock him down and
jump on his love trills? The Matinee Girl
no longer furiously applauds the Higginson
saunter, and remains unmoved when he
kisses the back hair of Olive Godwin in “The
Quaker Girl.”
Jessie Lonnen, the new arrival, who takes
the part of Phoebe in “The Quaker Girl,”
is a fascinating minx, for no very obvious
reason. A tall and rather lean slab of a
girl, a trifle stiff in her knee action, she
grins one’s attention and won’t let it go.
Blanche Browne is another puss who hangs
on to the better feelings of the audience, for
some occult reason not connected with
her voice, or any special claim to beauty.
“It’s just charm!” as Maggie says in J. M.
Barrie’s “What Every Woman Knows,” and
you’ve got to swallow it and ask no ques-
tions.
Ivy Schilling flashes short skirts of irides-
cent tangerine above a pair of substantial
legs in the Champagne Dance in “The
Quaker Girl.” In this smart sketch, Leslie
Holland, who has to catch the handsome
Schilling, earns his bread in the sweat of his
brow, these summer days, for the lady
passes through the air with the solid whir
of a Christmas hamper.
No fatalities have been recorded as the
result of the Manly water carnival on Sat-
urday night. This certificate to the patience
and good-humor of an Australian crowd,
when it finds itself in a tight corner, can
only be appreciated by those who safely
passed from the overburdened ferry boats to
the densely-packed Esplanade. At 5 p.m.
Manly was filling up to its last inch of kerb-
stone. Sydney seemed to be emptying its
human cqntents into the Corso. The over-
flow got away from the crush and dashed
into the surf, and the crowd on the beach
had considerably more than 4d. worth of
ecstatic enjoyment out of this item. At
seven o’clock there was breathing room only
on the Esplanade.
Thirty, thousand, or thereabouts, is the
semi-official estimate of the influx, and it is
probably under-stated. We all know what a
40,000 crowd looks like at a Test match.
Myriads of children swarmed over the edge
of the adult wave which surged from shore
to shore, and spidery bare legs, well tanned
by sun and wind, attached to small and
furiously-active bodies, crawled and twirled
over every pebble, boulder, or mere human
corn that could give a foothold. Many of
them were obviously Manly inhabitants,
these bare-headed, healthy little imps—a
sporting mixture of goats and grasshoppers
in their genius for balancing themselves in
the atmosphere. They were not a public
nuisance. They merely added to the gaiety
of tne Town of a Thousand Lights. “Who
owns this?” asked a voice in a herring-
barrel squeeze. “This” was a little human
male shrimp of three or so, tied up with a
large red belt. “Please, he belongs to me,”
answered an agitated treble. “Me” who was
quite five, collared her property, and wrig-
gled off, amid the 60,000 legs of the multi-
tude.
The chance to pay Is. each for breathing
space on a jetty, or 6d. apiece for chairs on
the Esplanade, was rushed by the early ar-
rivals. Next time Manly breaks out in
Chinese lanterns, its municipality ought to
steal 20,000 chairs, and rake in the same
number of sixpences. Lines of lanterns,
swung across the house fronts, a score or
two of decorative row boats, an illuminated
shark effigy emitting fearsome noises, a
band, also emitting loud noises, troubadours
under Mr. 11. Brewer, skimming across the
water, and the rather thin pipe of Manly’s
Venetian choir, anchored to a heavy-weight
pontoon, went towards the making of a good-
looking carnival.
Aid. C. D. Paterson, W. Heaton and Adam
Ogilvy pushed this evening party into the
public eye, with strenuous help from Mr. K.
V. Holmes, Mr. Shemwell and Mr. D. Hogan.
A house decoration committee (Mr. V.
Green, hon. sec.), a water trimming con-
spiracy (Mr. W. H. Walker, hon. sec.), and
a programme and collection squadron (almost
everybody more or less hon. sec.), organ-
ised minpr details. Why the ferry boats,
packed to the last inch of standing room on
their upper decks, didn’t sit down suddenly
on their sides, when there was a rush for
the illuminated view area, is only one among
the many miracles of the Manly water
escape.
When a Saturday afternoon crowd swal-
lows ozone at Bondi or Manly, it: generally
parts in the middle, or some other convenient
portion of its anatomy. Part of it stands
on the wet sand, where the creeping tide laps
the legs of the small fry, and the wooden'
buckets of infantine visitors wobble on the
shallow water. The rest of it gathers to-
gether in the surf, or fills itself with sand-
wiches and week-end pastry. The breaker
ladies who looked most shipshape at Manly
the other afternoon, were neatly strapped in
at the waist with leather belts, and closely
upholstered in their lower limbs with black
stockings and sandal shoes. The loosely-
made type of woman, with mountain-
ous curves, is sometimes rashly importunate
in the matter of her choice of sea frills.
Like a Greek chorus—but quieter in its re-
frain —the crowd (chiefly sac suit and straw
hat) flung carefully edited comments along
the line of dripping mermaids who skipped
the yellow sands on the track to the dress-
ing sheds on Saturday. The red kerchief
cap, with ears stuck up in front, is the
surf belle’s best-looking head-gear, when
she throws herself into the arms of a Manly
breaker.
Ethel Irving, in a stage box at a matinee
the other day, looked very weary after the
sobbing emotions of “Dame Nature” on the
previous night. She is rather thin and or-
dinary, as one sees her out of the collar, and
she consistently turned the back of a tired
black feather toque to the audience, while
she rested from her weeping. Ethel Irving’s
success as an actress —the most perfect in
her special line of feminine character
sketches this town has seen for many years
—is a triumph of mind over matter.
The Crown-street Women’s Hospital,
which is hanging out signals of distress in
the matter of ward space, will hold its an-
nual general meeting on Monday afternoon,
January 29. Visitors will be allowed to
patrol the premises, which palpitate with
the pressure of sick humanity, from 2.30
p.m. on that day.
In a lean week, chiefly filled with nor'-
easter and the far-off swish of the Asiatic
invasion, an English magazine, with an al-
leged Australian story, fell across my path.
The writer evidently knows his subject—as
they know Australia who live in Bloomsbury
or St. Paul’s Churchyard. “A Bushranger’s
Daughter” shows internal evidences of some
study of the Kelly Gang, or other light lit-
erature of our continent. “Bushranging
ran in her family In those days (1850),
in Australia, a chance word, or a vague
hint, and a man might swing for it The
most innocent persons slept with a pistol
under their pillows,” etc. The heroine, by
the way, who is a Thames Embankment re-
flection of Kate Kelly, rides a thoroughbred
horse back and forwards to the bushranger’s
eyrie in the “Strathgoolong Ranges” (pos-
sibly “Strathbogie”) at midnight, as a regu-
lar pastime. She finally jumps a chasm
which the artist has obligingly placed in an
English forest. “Black men,” and a hope-
lessly imbecile police force, cive this story,
apparently by an inexperienced pen, the
“tang” which the untravelled Londoner
firmly believes is Australian life.
As a pioneer, Parson Sam Marsden was a
member of the scanty settlement in
N.S.W., when the nineteenth century was
young. Like those of much greater men,
Marsden’s life story is a bone which con-
tinues to be picked with some acrimony. In
the S. M. Herald, the other day, some let-
ters written by Marsden (1790-1814), re
his sheep and other live-stock ventures, ap-
peared in connection with one of the interm-
inable controversies that still rage round the
farmer-parson’s rather piebald character.
They travelled from Farsley (near Leeds,
England), but are quite familiar here. I
fancy all or most of these letters appear in
Hassall’s reminiscences. Whether Mars-
den bred sheep for patriotism or profit (or
for both excellent reasons) was less interest-
ing to the assigned servants of his time than
his fixed idea that the devil could be flogged
out of a man. Provided the man was in that
station of life which made him floggable,
the fierce old preacher always assumed that
the devil was in him, and that it was his
duty to get it out. A first-class Inquisition
was lost through Marsden being born out of
due date.
May your shadow grow less, Arini, for the
days of the plump are full of sorrow, and
the slim sihouette reigns in the land.
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, January 22, 1912.
My Dear Yarrie, —
State Governor Fuller did the opening of
the Premiers’ Conference, at State Parlia-
ment House, on Wednesday. His frock coat
was decorated with a red rose, -and lie wore a
solitary gold-laced Gentleman Help behind
his chair. His speech was quite fierce in
spots. One spot was where he got this off:
“There is, perhaps, no more difficult Consti-
tution to work in the civilised world than the
Constitution under which we live in Aus-
tralia.” Which sounded rather like the wail
of one overshadowed. However, he ex-
pressed the hope that the wrangles about the
unification of the railway gauge would
bring forth fruit; also, that the Murray
waters would not be allowed to pour them-
selves into the sea much longer. While the
speakers droned and stumbled, the women
aloft' (who had been invited to the tea-party)
yawned and criticised hats and heads. The
badly-needed refreshments were handed
round in the members’ dining rooms. Mrs.
John Murray, in white cloth, acted as
hostess. Lady Fuller, who had motored
down from Macedon. wore crffpe de Chine.
Auntie Phipps was in yellow, to match the
petrol waggon, in wnich they sprinted home
again immediately the party was over. The
Gaud Mayoress, with horseshoes on her hat,
hurried away at the same time to an oyster
opening. Byron Moore watched the proceed-
ings in company with a daughter who had on
a matronly hat. Mrs. Secretary Harkness,
from Sydney, was etched in smart black and
white stripes. Mrs. Holman, another Sydney-
sider, hung a brocade chair cover round hex-
plump shoulders. Mrs. Shields, looking very
impressive in black, had her daughter with
hex-. Mrs. Pearce, who has a strong leaning
towards politics, invaded the crow-like groups
of men garbed daintily in blue. Informal
plans were made in all corners for the enter-
tainment of the visitors. Next evening the
men-folk dined at Parliament Plouse with
Fuller, and buttressed the sacred (I nearly
wrote “scared”) cause of State Frights witlx
much good food.
The return trip of the Linlithgow pair
through Yankeeland does not seem to have
benefited the lady. She has never been able
to travel beyond Liverpool since crossing the
Atlantic. The bouquets which were to have
been thrown at the newly-married peer at
the belated coming-of-age celebrations wilted
long ago, and the joyous uproar of the ten-
antry has been postponed until the Mar-
chioness is herself again.
The Campbells, of Murray Downs, have
had no less than three deaths in five months.
The first to go was the grand old dame, Mrs.
Charlie. She was followed very soon by son-
in-law Johnstone, who squatted near Bal-
larat. This week comes the sad news that his
widow (she was Mary Campbell before her
mai-i-iage) has also passed away. Two
young girleens survive their parents, and
will have money to burn.
Kathleen Oliver, who was one of the shin-
ing lights amongst the scientific research
pupils of the University, has taken up the
study of domestic economy. The tall, clever
girl was quietly married last week in Sydney
to a former fellow-student. Most of the
bride’s family expressed to the Ma State for
the wedding. The pair are looking happily
forward to a life on the land in Westi-alia,
where they have taken up a tract.
Nowadays every society miss yearns to be
able to “shove” her own motor; and the driv-
ing tests seem to grow daily more severe.
One majestic matron, whose 18-year-old is
qualifying for her driver’s license, was horri-
fied on hearing that the law specifies a drive
through the city with a policeman. “My
daughter driving with a policeman! The
idea!” Still policemen are very steady and
reliable.
Wally Moore, a gilded young man of this
city, is at present suffering from a fine col-
lection of bruises. He and a chum took
Dad’s finest motor for an evening spin. They
collided with a cab, smashed the motor, ac-
quired black eyes and blue and black patches,
and had their lovely clothes cut to pieces.
They extricated themselves, and took refuge,
at two in the morning, with a sympathetic
grandmother, who bound up their wounds
and cheered them on to the inevitable inter-
view with Dad.
Barrister Bonner has come up from his
Portsea cottage a rejuvenated man. A
severe operation put him out of horsehair
for a considerable time.
The two John Highett daughters had the
time of their lives at the Dux-bar celebra-
tions. One of their diversions was a state
promenade on the roof of an elephant, whose
immense countenance had been either
painted red, or was flushed as a result of
drink.
Mrs. Edwin Miller (sister of the Bowes
Kelly lady) walked down the gangway of the
mail steamer the other day, with her orphan
niece, Belle White, who was her companion
during the sojourn in Fogland. A detach-
ment of Kellys rushed over from the Fly-
speck to fall on the returned wanderers’
necks.
Kathleen Fitzgerald, daughter of the late
Surgeon Thomas, arrived home from her
Durbar trip by the Macedonia. She will
spend a busy time and much money collect-
ing happy rags for her bridal outfit. As Mrs.
Colonel Douglas, her future address will be
somewhere in India.
Miss Anne Payne, the octogenarian aunt
of M.L.C. Payne and his brothers, died at
Tooralc last week. She was an invalid for
the last few years of her long life.
Alan Newton, the youthful medico son of
Clerk-of-the-Assembly Newton, has been
taken on as lieutenant by Surgeon Fred
Bird.
Squatter Alan Currie, who married the
youngest daughter of the Albert Miller pair,
managed to let his motor-car turn turtle the
other day, whilst taking the air in the West-
ern district. All save a Grice niece, who
sustained slight concussion, emerged from
the smash unhurt.
Barrister Bill Furlonge, a cousin of Ted
Mitchell, K.C., spent the Christmas holidays
on the sick list. He only managed to strug-
gle off the painful document a few days ago.
Furlonge is remarkaple for a marvellous
memory. Also, he is remarkable for having
once been sternly reprimanded by the Wax-
cellency for addressing a female in court as
“My good woman.”
Rita Kiddle, back aeain in Melbourne, is
wearing black for her uncle, Lewis Kiddle,
who died the other day. She is getting full
accounts from her numerous friends of the
number and bitterness of the tears they shed
when the report of her death travelled out
from London.
The newly-acquired -wife of Solicitor J. C.
Stewart has quite tamed her new motor.
She is a qualified chaffeuse, and is licensed to
scatter pedestrians on her own.
The timber-yard Moores, who dwell in the
loftiest of St. Kilda-road palaces, are packing
their boxes for a March flitting. Papa,
mamma and the boys intend to make a two-
years orbit round the earth.
When people sell off, why do they leave
signed portraits of their friends in the silver
frames? At an auctioneer’s orgie, the other
day, I noticed a lady called “Maud” who had
been left for the highest bidder. The habit
or vice of presenting signed photographs will
die out if the ungraceful habit continues.
Paymaster-in-Chief Mannisty, who came
from Fogland, last summer, to join our
young navy, has quietly carried off a Sydney
bride —Miss Flo McCathie, of Pymble. The
pair are now honeymooning at the George
Hotel, St. Kilda, and hunting for. a Toorak
house in which to dump their elegant goods
and chattels. The bride has an enviable col-
lection of house linen. One piece is a won-
derful tablecloth covered with Australian
flowers and birds. The wedding was a quiet
seven o’clock affair, and happened in the
Pymble house. The bride wore a filmy din-
ner dress of rose point lace, and a family
party of about 20 subsequently sat down to
supper in a room decorated with pink carna-
tions and roses.
St. Kilda beach rejoices again in its ama-
teur Lady Godiva. The damsel is shapely,
young and fair, and she arrives early on her
horse, clad only in a bathing dress and a
long cloak, which is flung off at the water’s
edge. The shapely one then dashes into the
sea, until only the head of her mount is visi-
ble. After a good swim, she heads the steed
shorewards, and gallops up and down the
strand. When she is going full speed ahead,
with her hair streaming in the breeze, she
makes one of the best moving pictures on the
market.
The latest matrimonial engagement sig-
nalled is that of Carl Gillespie, of Northern
Westralia, to Myrtle Dillon, of Melbourne.
The fiancee is the first chick of the Dillon,
w-ho, with partner Burrows, made much
money out of lollies. Mrs. Dillon was one of
Melbourne’s belles years ago. She is a sister
of Dr. Moloney. Daughter Myrtle, who is
of the petite type, has just returned from a
scurry abroad. The fiance, who has his share
of nice looks, is the eldest son of Miller
James Gillespie, who has dropped grain for
sheep-breeding in the West.
The latest notable blue-blooded bankrupt,
“Captain the Hon. Gerald Oakley Cadogan,
Viscount Chelsea” (as the Cold Country
press hath it), offspring of Earl Cadogan,
did the thing on epic lines. For a long time,
Chelsea was a younger son, with only a
beggarly £7OO per annum on which to make
both ends meet. So he didn’t try to make
them meet, and his noble dad had to separate
himself from several thousands of pounds to
silence the howls of the creditors. In August,
1910, Chelsea succeeded his elder brother as
heir, and got a rise to £2500 a year. His
household expenses since June, 1910, are
set down by himself at £10,083. In addition,
he paid away £12,000 as interest on borrowed
coin; and “presents to friends and relatives”
cost him £lO,OOO. Of £lO,OOO which he shov-
elled into the jeweller’s hands, he explains
that £4500 represented goods given to Lady
Chelsea; the rest, presumably, was presented
to the aforementioned “relatives and friends.”
The gifts to friends can be understood. But
why should a man set fire to his cheque book
for relatives? Most of us would rather set
fire to the relatives.
Explorer Karl Kumm gave his wife’s
bridesmaids gold-mounted shark’s teeth. The
chewing apparatus of the sea scourge is a
peculiar—not to say, gruesome —wedding
gift. A lawyer bridegroom, of course, could
say that they were a souvenir of a deceased
brother.
The sale of the Ernest Brookes house-
gods provided some excitement. for society
and others last week. A pathetic feature of
the dispersal was the glumness of the Scotch
gardener, who saw his carefully-tended
nurslings divided up into lots for the. sacri-
fice. Camelot was thrown open for inspec-
tion days before the sale, and the cars of the
petrol classes stood before the gate for hours.
The tram-car orders rolled up in loads all
day long. The more expensive people have a
habit of attending these sales decked out in
their best chiffons —as though the passing of
the stylish portals, even on a purely mercen-
ap’ mission, demanded fete dress. The fur-
nishings w T ere French. A great clothes-
press, like a small house, of exquisitely in-
laid wood, was pronounced by an excited
female to be “Lou-iss Quince.”
In the Winter Garden, on Saturday night,
30 red-coats dined enthusiastically amongst
scarlet flowers, blood-red ribbons and much
bunting. It was “the Sixth” giving a send-off
to Colonel Courtney, who is departing to
Fogland on a work-and-play trip. Rupert
Bunny departs this month for the
same region, with his pocket book nicely
upholstered and a lighter sketch-portfolio.
Captain Nutting, whose dad visits these
shores to see how his small son is get-
ting on, can easily distance his brother aides
on the Denman staff with three distinct
brands of dog. The first is his yapping Aus-
tralian terrier; the second is his large pri-
vate car; and the third is what he puts on
for special occasions.
Someone with a keen sense of rumor says
that the debonnair Sep. Miller has settled
£15,000 on Muriel Henderson, his prospective
bride. The wedding, which is now almost
within hail, will be bridesmaided by Henry
Madden’s daughter.
The Tom Fitzgeralds have sold the Ber-
wick acres and baa lambs, and are coming
to live in suburban Oakleigh, which place is
handier than Berwick to the Royal Golf
Links.
The station folk are now rolling through
town on the way to the seaside. They don’t
shed any Bathurst burrs in the process. The
Melbournian notices a few strange cars
about the streets, and encounters smartly-
dressed strangers in the teashops—that is
all. The sheepy women are mostly pleasing
athletic figures, in good linen or tussore
tailorings, while the kiddies are very spruce
about the hair, and mostly wear bare legs
and sandals.
A rich but wary bachelor, who has been
the despair of marriage-making mothers for
many seasons, has been observed throwing
tender glances towards a widow. Unat-
tached girls moan at the unfairness of it.
The widow has had her allowance of hus-
band, and is wealthy into the bargain, whilst
the moaning ones have neither cash in hand
nor a money-maker in view.
One day last week, Gaud Mayor Davey,
accompanied by his Gaudess, performed the
formal “opening” of a nook in the Fitzroy
Gardens, where a new lakelet and lawn have
lately appeared under the direction of Guil-
foyle. The spot has been open for years, and,
to the naked eye, doesn’t look more open
than it was. Possibly the sleeper-out, in the
waste hours of the night, notices an added
ferocity in the wind that blows over the
“opened” spot; but no difference is apparent
by day. By the way, was there ever an
official opening of the sea by a Gaud Mayor?
If there was not, the open sea must still be
shut —at least, so far as the Best People are
concerned.
A good deal of bad luck has pursued the
crew of the drunken vessel in which Sinbad
set sail in search of the Valley of Diamonds.
First, there was the death of skipper Frank
Lincoln. Now Nell Finnis, the maiden with
the picture post-card teeth, who used to look
such a neat figure in a middy’s uniform, has
had to desert the vessel owing to nervous
breakdown, and will be docked in a private
hospital for a couple of weeks, at least. Her
principal-girl part has been handed over to
Miss Mary Morris Smith, the sweet-faced
Australian damsel who last year annexed
the first prize in West’s Beauty Competi-
tion. Emperor Fred Winn was also out of
the cast for a space last week owing to a
troublesome throat.
Comedian Bert Bailey, who is floating out
as “Bert Bailey, Limited,” has been stalking
Gregan McMahon’s Repertory people to fill
some gaps in his company. The new mimes
start business in March, at Sydney Palace.
Bailey has dramatised Steele Rudd’s “On
Our Selection,” and *Dad is to rage before
the footlights ere long.
Ada Crossley and Clara Butt are genuine
pals. Recently, when Ada was steaming
home from South Africa, her ship passed that
containing Clara and husband Rumford, then
on their way towards African audiences. The
pair exchanged wireless endearments. For
once, on meeting, they were unable to ex-
change and try on hats. When ladies can try
on hats by wire, science may consider that it
has really arrived.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
An echo of the days when we were war-mad, and
wore red-white-and-blue straws in our hair, comes in
the death of Bugler, at Angaston. The old horse was
given by Mr. J. C. F. Johnson to raise funds for the
war, and was auctioned over and over again by the
late Theodore Bruce —a champion in the hammer-
wielding line. “Abe” Shannon topped the list of
buyers at 100 guineas, and when we stopped shrieking
“Rule Britannia,” the noble steed, who by this time
looked as if he were going to bolt or founder or some-
thing, was permanently handed over and passed on to
Angaston.
Mr. W. H. ‘Squires, who died the other day in
England, and left a matter of £16,000 behind him,
was at one time in the Civil Service of this State.
His wife was one of the numerous Hughes clan.
This week sees a vast female exodus to Tasmania.
Some are going for purely frivolous reasons, others to
attend a Women’s Conference. In the .first category
is Miss Isabel Young, who teaches artistic dancing,
while Mrs. Makin and Mrs. Davies Thomas are among
those who have sterner business on hand.
The outgoing mail took away three members of
the Squires family—a small boy and girl who are to
be deposited at school, and an elder sister, Margaret,
who will keep an eye on her juniors during the
voyage.
Saturday’s cricket tragedy was made more awful
by a heat wave. Let us draw a veil or an umbrella
over the painful subject, and bury it sadly in the
freezing chamber.
Miss Maud Puddy, Mus. Bac., was to have given
a concert, in Vienna, early this month. She carries
our warmest wishes with her. Another S. Aus-
tralian who’s doing us proud is Miss Bessie Tyas.
Her father used to “Profess” at our University. She
sang at a concert at the iEolian Hall, with Mr.
Vernon Warner as a co-“star,” and the London
papers say nice things about her. Leila Doubledav’s
concert was also a big success. In fact, in a musical
manner of speech, we are keeping our end up.
Skuthorpe’s Buckjumpers betook themselves to the
Exhibition Oval on Saturday, and bucked and lassoed
like anything. As usual, one of the most absorbing
items was unrehearsed. The management had offered
a prize of a gold bracelet to the winner of an open
ladies’ race. Frenzied with enthusiasm, one of the
contestants laid detaining hands on a competitor
immediately ahead, and a smart bout, wherein hair
and hairpins flew like curses in a State Parliament,
ensued. The bloodshed was stopped ultimately by the
Law.
Strathalbyn won the polo match, at Mount Craw-
ford, last week, and so got well-nigh within grab-
bing distance of the Richard Smith Challenge Cup.
The Anal match (between Adelaide and Strathalbyn)
will be played at Plympton next week. The polo
world is chortling in that a number of young players
—Murrays and Angases and Stirlings and so forth —•
are coming on. The Time is thoroughly ripe for
such a happening, since many of the present-day
members of the teams are more fitted, physically, for
elephant-steering than for polo-plaving.
Obit on Wednesday, Miss Alice Morgan, daughter
of the late William Morgan, Knight, and sister of
Mrs. Arthur Waterhouse. Her mother died some two
years ago.
Dr. Bennett, who’s back from honeymooning in
Maoriland, filled in some of his time inquiring into
racing matters there. lie also gave evidence before
the N. S. Wales Totalisator Commission, and bought
half a dozen new horses.
As I write, another heat-wave is surging down on
this devoted hamlet. My thoughts stray from social
matters, and turn yearningly, insistently, to the sub-
ject of cold drinks. Fare thee well.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

POLITICAL
POINTS
THE MAN WHO ALWAYS MISSED
THE ’BUS.
“It seems that platforms were made merely to get
in by—not to remain on afterwards.” —Joe Cook,
sarcastically, on political promises.
And if some kind power had only recognised
the purpose of Joseph’s numerous little platforms
that now , alas! litter the political track , he
might have been permitted to board the car at
[?]i stcr e and enjoy a seat inside.
According to a Sydney evening paper:—
Liberal Ministers attend in a very resolute spirit.
They are going to fight, and fight hard against Federal
advancement. They will not yield one hair’s breadth.
They will not hear of the transcontinental railway
being built without the State’s bondholders being
consulted. According to the private arrangement
made some time ago between State Ministers, the
Federal line may be built as projected by the Fisher
Government, but the State Governments will not,
under present conditions, alter their lines to link up
with it. So that unless some compromise is arrived
at, the desert railway will finish at Port Augusta,
and there will have to be a break of gauge at that
place and another break in Melbourne before the half
circle can be made of the continent by rail.
Well, Port Augusta will be a big Federal
port when the railways from Perth and Port
Darwin meet there, especially if it has
short-line connections with Albany and Es-
perance Bay, and it will probably be able
to do without the recognition of “Liberal”
Premiers.
Private Enterprise is either a great ass or
a great prevaricator, and a “General Mer-
chant’s” recent statement to Melbourne
’Erald doesn’t settle the question. Accord-
ing to this yarn, the benevolent gentlemen
who import ales and stout are now
making no profit worth mentioning,
while the merchants who pass the
liquid goods on to hotels and grocers are
actually losing 3 per cent, on the value
of each transaction. Heaven knows just
why they commit this surprising folly—ap-
parently they must sell imported goods or
burst. The curious feature of the sad case
is that “General Merchant” seems to think
they deserve sympathy. And in a way they
do. Men who are prepared to lose money
rather than give their own country a job
can’t be ouite sane.
Inspired by the visit of the Jap training
ships to Sydney the S. M. Herald burst
forth on the need of “great national quali-
ties.” “What we really lack,” said the
Ghadbandish old rag, with as much smug-
ness as though it had never played the State
Fright game in its life, “is an infusion of
national qualities, and among the most ele-
mentary of them is a grasp of the serious-
ness of things, a fight against the enervation
of our easy circumstances, a determined
effort to achieve the nationhood of which we
boast sometimes without due reason.” By
way of inculcating “a grasp of the serious-
ness of things” the Herald published in the
same issue a large, polysyllabic leader on the
Adelaide .cricket match. The Telegraph
did likewise, and helped along our spirit of
nationhood by referring to the Australians
as “the colonial players.” The Common-
wealth will, no doubt, ultimately appreciate
that it _is no longer a colony, and that
cricket is not one of the serious things of
life where grown up people are concerned,
but the “Liberal” dailies are putting in some
fine work in the way of delaying that desir-
able consummation.
“Pressman”: Brave words in S. M. Her-
ald by one John Young, of Mosman, con-
cerning the proposal to resume Federal Gov-
ernment House, Sydney:—
Let another meeting be called early, at which I
hope to speak and. further in every way I can the
efforts of our influential men to place this important
matter on a basis satisfactory to the people. I shall
be glad to join again in another deputation to the
Government.
It was my lot to attend the last meeting of
protest against Holman’s alleged outrage.
It was one of the dreariest and most futile
affairs imaginable. Twenty-odd citizens,
mostly old ladies and deadbeats, sat uneasily
in one of the smaller
ante-chambers of the
Town Hall, while a
number of elderly
male Govern ment
House frequenters
harangued them pas-
sionately from behind
a rampart of deal
table and glass water
bottle. Viewed as a
dead failure, the in-
surrection was only
surpassed by a meet-
ing which occurred in
the same room, a
couple of years ago,
having for its
object the resuscita-
tion of Freetrade. It
is no use John Young,
or any other “Loyal-
ist,” clamoring . for
vast public meetings,
in regard to certain
questions. The pub-
lie is utterly* disinter-
ested, and, in consequence, it firmly declines
to meet.
“We are all Socialists in our saner
moments,” said Premier John Hurry, of
Victoria, the other day. Just so —all So-
cialists when we think, and Anti-Soshers
when we don’t; all Socialists when we are
not on the make, or contesting an election —
bar the cocky, who is only a Socialist when
he is on the make and wants low railway
freights, or free seed, or Government cool
stores, or an increased municipal subsidy.
THE HEARING OF NOISES IS THE
FIRST SYMPTOM OF INSANITY.
A hundred motor-cars buzz past, each one giving
forth some new variety of hideous sound. Boys with
hatefully shrill voices shriek race-cards with an ear-
piercing note. A traincar crossing an intersection
bangs its bell vilely for half a furlong before the
gripman's arm drops from sheer exhaustion.—Mel-
bourne Argus.
One of those people who gird at legisla-
tive interference with Private Enterprise
now wishes that the State had interfered
with him a little more strenuously. He
owns a weapon called a buzzer plane at his
Geelong factory, and the Factories’ officers
lately ordered him, among others, to have it
protected by a guard, for the safety of his
employees. He said a guard was quite un-
necessary, and he would sooner dismantle it
than hamper it by such a needless encum-
brance. He threw it out of gear for a
while, but, during the holidays, set it going
again, operating it himself. Before an hour
passed he was two fingers short. It will
have a vuard now.
The Yic. Government has at last informed
Melbourne Harbor Trust that its policy of
discriminating between goods shipped at
different ports is illegal. The Board’s only
reply is that it thought it was being patri-
otic, inasmuch as it charged least for Vic-
torian goods, and worked gradually up till
the farthest-out foreigner was hit five times
as hard. Probably the Trust had the best
intentions: the only drawback is that it
doesn’t happen to be its job to revise the
Customs tariff, or abrogate the Constitu-
tional principle of inter-State free trade.
For that matter, neither is it the Railway
Commissioners’ job; yet they go on doing
it, and the Commonwealth Inter-State Com-
mission—which the Constitution says “there
shall be,” on purpose to stop such tricks —
seems just as far off as ever.
That strange organisation, “The Society
of Free Workers,” held a meeting in Mel-
bourne the other night-, at which the secre-
tary complained of “the bitter and unwar-
ranted opposition” of some undiscerning
toilers, who were unable to see that the
objects of the society were similar to those
the unions aimed at. The only difference
was that the society meant to arrive “by
lawful means,” presumably by being affable
to everybody, no matter what happened.
Labor mostly gets what it wants by lawful
means; but now and then lawful means
break down just as badly as international
arbitration does. When that drear hour
strikes, _ the vague, shadowy society which
has arisen to share organised Labor’s loaf
will be free to drift out of the dispute. Still,
it is unable to understand why Labor re-
gards it with aversion. It didn’t help to get
the loaf, and it isn’t prepared to defend it,
but it is quite willing to share it.
“Locust” theorises:—
The question of how to dispose of N.S.W. Speaker
Willis now appears to have superseded the coon-fight
in the public mind. Willis, who started out to blaze
a very straight track, has got bushed, through over-
sensitiveness, or vanity, or something; and there is
a possibility that he may have to be moved. In
theory, the Assembly can pass a resolution deposing
the Speaker; but Willis has risen superior to all
theory up to now—as the Wade-Wood crowd knows
,to its cost, and he may decline to submit the motion.
The Ma State may then have a modern replica of the
scene in the Commons, in 1629, when Valentine and
Hollis and Speaker Lenthall in his chair, while they
read a motion which he had refused to put, and,
with locked doors, the key on the table of the House,
the “Black Rod” banging in vain for admittance,
the resolution was passed. If McGowen, on the
one side, and Wade, on the other, hold Willis down,
while a resolution deposing him is passed, a police-
man can do the rest —as the Speaker has proved.
But, m the first place, there is a lack of unanimity
about Wade and McGowen. In the second place, sup-
posing Willis lets out with both feet, and then
snatches the key and leaps for the door, he won’t
have nearly so many members to fight his way
through is in Lenthall’s case. Furthermore, Willis
may guess what is coming, and have the police ready.
Lenthall couldn’t. There were no police in his day.
DR. SHELDON’S GIN PILLS.
For all Kidney Troubles, use Dr. Sheldon’s Gin
Pills. One of these pills contains in a concentrated
form all the curative properties of a pint of the
finest gin, together with other important ingredients
recognised by the medical profession as being re-
medial agents of the highest value for the kidneys
and allied organs. Price, Is. 6d. and 2s. 6d.*
Experiments were recently conducted to find out
“whether a certain beef extract (Bovril), supplied
to the [British] Government had any nutritive value ”
The results all round were extraordinary. “In each
series of experiments on the dogs it was found that
the actual increase in weight varied from 10 to 20
times the weight of the ev+T-qot arM-vl *o the fond,
whilst in the hyjnan experiments the increase was
even more marked.”*
In the closing hours of the
Victorian Assembly Premier
Weary promised to consider
the grievances of the Vic. police.
A few of the things which the
general public reckons it is up
to John to do are (1) increase
the miserable pittance of the
men; (2) restore the pensions
which are now denied to the
younger men; (3) give a man
with genuine ability a chance
to rise at a quicker rate than a
stripe in 20 or 25 years; and
(4) remember that seven days
of work in the week is as bad
in the police force as in any
other line. There are other
needed reforms, but the above
would do to break the ice of
equity, so to speak.
Ex - Governor-General Dud-
ley has raised his voice in Eng-
land to the effect that seven
Legislatures of two Houses a-
piece are rather over the odds
for Australia with its popula-
tion of less than 5,000,000. It
is a very common remark, yet
Australia is in no way sur-
prising or unusual. Switzer-
land, for instance, with less
population than Australia and
less than the area of Tasmania,
has 23 Parliaments. Germany
has about 40; the United
States, 47; Canada, 10; Mex-
ico, 27; Brazil, Argentina, Ven-
ezuela and other Spanish-
American countries have each
got a heap. Australia, in fact,
has got a fairly large—though
not unusually large—stock of Legislatures
for its population, but for its size it has, so
few that they are hardly worth mentioning.

THE DANGER OF
DEFICIENT BLOOD.
The System Lacks its Chief
Defence Against Disease,
Dr, Williams' Pink Pills have been
found a Sure and Speedy Means
of Replenishing the Blood Supply.
The gravest danger of Anaemia is the
fact that the system’s chief defence against
disease is broken down. Thin impure blood
is virtually an irritation to disease. The
blood works night and day to maintain the
health and strength of the body. Any de-
ficiency in the blood supply weakens na-
ture’s defence against disease. Anaemia is
the doctor’s name for lack of blood. Its
chief symptoms are paleness and lack of
energy. It attacks young girls; those re-
covering from acute illnesses, such as fevers,
and persons of advanced years. The only
cure for Anaemia is an increased blood
supply. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have been
found to increase the blood supply of
Anaemic people in an astonishing way.
After using them for a time, sufferers have
found the most distressing Anaemic symptoms
give place to red cheeks, good appetite,
strength and energy. The following case is
a typical example :
“I was going to business, and I think the
close confinement did not agree with my
health,” said Mrs. Florence Mackin, 64
Kent Street, North Richmond, Melbourne.
“Anyhow my strength began to fade, and m,y
blood turned more watery every day. When
I looked in the glass I noticed how white
my lips and gums were getting, and in my
fg.ce every bit of color faded. I began to
lose all taste for my food unless I could get
hold of anything acid or sharp tasting.
Every day I got more tired and languid. It
was as much as I could do to drag about,
especially on hot days. My head would
ache in the temples, just as if a hammer were
beating it, and when these attacks came I
could not bear to be bothered with any-
thing, the throbbing was so persistent. If I
went for a walk my heart would start beat-
ing twice as quick as it ought to, and I
would fairly lose my breath if I hurried,
and now and again I would get dizzy, faint
sort of turns, especially if I stooped. A
trial of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills gave every ■
satisfaction. After a while I could not help
noticing my blood was getting richer, for I
began to lose the waxy look and get color in
the gums and lips. My appetite began to
steadily improve, and my strength to return
till I felt thoroughly built up.”
It is well to remember that it was Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills, and not an imitation,
that cured Mrs. Mackin. Getting the
genuine is an important thing in a cure.

A SUBLIME SACRIFICE!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sir,—You correctly designate Federal Government
House as the “national guest chamber.” Constitu-
tionally, morally, and by prescriptive right, the place
is as much a residence of the King as Windsor
Castle, Balmoral Castle, or Dublin Castle... .Icono-
clasts have decided that this pleasantly-placed man-
sion shall no longer be an emblem of Monarchy.
They have, in effect, given the King notice....
It cannot be that they are going to allow this
great act of repudiation done in their name to pass;
to allow a handful of Goths to take from Csesar that
which is Caesar’s.... If so, then fidelity is dead, and
there is no good left in us. But this cannot be.
Let us believe that the torpor at present exhibited
is but the deep silence preeursing a storm. — J. Laker
Macmillan, in Sydney Telegraph.
What horror and terror hang over the Nation!
We welter in treason and tergiversation!
We writhe in the grip of some murderous villain!
And who is it warns us? Why Mr. Macmillan! .
Oh, speak not of Curtins, who perished untimely—
Of Arnold von Winkelried, dying sublimely—
Of Byron’s immortal, lone prisoner of C' illon —
Their woes are outdone by the griefs of Macmillan.
The wrath of the gods, and the terror of slaughter—
Heroic endurance through fire and through water—
These things have been faced in Humanity’s story;
Then, let us refuse not Macmillan due glory!
Australia! My country! Your path is uncertain,
And wars are approaching that you may be hurt in;
But, always remember, though foes should enslave
thee,
Macmillan at one time rushed forward to save thee!
When insolent persons, whose names do not matter,
Showed rudeness and treason —and chiefly the
latter —
Remember, Australia, the parties who scorned you
Were promptly denounced by the great man who
warned you!
When George and his Person and Throne were in
danger;
And, homeless, he wandered, an outcast and
stranger—
When Csesar was robbed and deprived of his coin,
say,
By the Goths and the Vandals of Glebe and Drum-
moyne, say!—
When, heedless of Windsor, Balmoral and Dublin —■
Those insolent persons with treason were bubblin’,
And squashing our grand Constitution with unction
By vilely depriving the King of his function:—
When rogues adventitious and weirdly fantastic
Brought shame to thy name by acts iconoclastic,
And outrage and infamy heaped o’er and o’er thee,
Who, then —O my country ! Who strove to restore
thee?
A curse, or a blight, such as falls on pertaters,
Afflict, and pursue, and destroy all low traitors!
But here’s to the triplice that none may dissever
The King and Macmillan and Bunkum for ever!

GENTLEMAN JACK.
By DON DELANEY.
Illustrated. Price l/=, Post Free 1/1.
Bushranging- for revenge, not profit, is the keynote of “Gentleman Jack,” and those who are in
search of startling episodes and SDlendid situations should peruse this veritable romance of bush-
rangmg. “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” is not one whit more remarkable than this tale of the man
who js bushranger and lover by turns, and who creates that air of mystery throughout that is so dear
to the reader’s heart.
Altogether, a rattling story, apart from the fact that the doings of the notorious Ben Hall gang
are woven in with the main plot, and lend it a keen note of tragedy.
A book one is likely to read from cover to cover before leaving off.

By AMBROSE PRATT. Illustrated by Lionel Lindsay.
Price 1/-, Post Free 1/1.
Mr. Ambrose Pratt’s work is so well and favorably known to our
Australian readers that there is no need to enlarge on it. In this new
book he very graphically describes the doings of the Ben Hall Gang of
Bushrangers, and goes to some trouble to give the true ring of authen-
ticity to his work. The many stirring episodes in Ben Hall’s life are
depicted with such skill, that while we are reading actual historical
happenings, the whole thing has an air of romance that some might
say was worthy of a better cause. Some hitherto unpublished parts
throw a new light on Hall’s character, and show how in those days
there were many police-made criminals.
Decidedly this is a book worth buying and keeping.
STELLA SOTHERN,
A. Tale of the Bush and Bohemia.
By IVAN ARCHER ROSENBLUM.
Illustrated by Harry Julius.
Price l/», Post Free 1/1.
The Bush and Bohemia to most minds are social extremes, and often mean innocence and the
opposite, and Stella Sothern’s experiences in both spheres are worth knowing. Mr. Rosenblum speaks
of things as he has seen them, and no one, after reading this book, will say he is far wrong. The
work is cleverly done, and is sure to bring the author into further prominence amongst our Austra-
lian writers of fiction.
But “Stella Sothern” is not all fiction ; rather it is fiction founded upon fact, and emphasises the
old adage that “truth is stranger than fiction.” The scenes in Bohemia—-Australian Bohemia at that
—-are quite unique, and should arouse a lot of intern t.

In the whole history of Australian Bushranging no gang was more notorious than that captained
by Ned Kelly. Various accounts of the doings of this gang have appeared, but none bears the hall-
mark of truth so pointedly as these leaves from a dead' man’s diary, as edited by Mr. Pratt, who has
presented the story so convincingly that, for tense interest and exciting events, it has few, if any,
equals.
Dan Kelly was the only member of the gang who escaped the clutches of the law, and his account
of the last stand at Glenrowan is a veritable human document.

were said to represent the feelings of “the players”
to materialise into personalities. It had its effect.
After a little hesitation, Clem Hill, Trumper, Arm-
strong, Ransford, Cotter and Carter scrambled out
from behind the newspaper fence, and demanded that
the Board of Control should back down, eat humble
pie, and abrogate its decision to keep absolute con-
trol of the 1912 tour to England. They did it, in a
long-winded and rambling letter which suggests that
the Six are a little worse at letter-writing than they
are at Test cricket on recent form. They demand to
be allowed to appoint one of the players as manager,
and that he shall be really manager. The Board may
send a man to look after its interests, but he must
be paid by the Board, and stand on the door-mat
with his hat in his hand, and take what information
the haughtv player-manager likes to throw his way.
But, most important of all, his salary and exes, must
not be charged against the takings of the tour. Not
one sixpence that might get into the pockets of the
players must be diverted on his account. And if the
Board doesn’t climb down, then the Six won’t go to
England.
There is only one answer. The names of the Six
must be eliminated from the list of possibles. With
the exception of Carter, not one of them will be
missed, on recent form. The colts, in the State
matches, made an infinitely better showing against
the English bowling than did the veterans in the
Test matches. Why these gentry should have got
themselves dubbed as “certainties” in the anonymous
campaign is hard to understand, except on the theory
that they are suffering from enlargement of the hat,
and really believe in their conceit that they cannot
be done without. As a matter of solemn fact, the
letter of the Six has cleared the air a lot. It has
made it possible to drop, without any signs of
cruelty, a number of gentlemen of somewhat avari-
cious nature who, on recent Test form, have fallen
from the rank of players to that of has-beens. As
the Greeks said. “They whom the gods would destroy
they first make mad.” Perhaps they had the same
sort of trouble before the Test match with Persia.

Australia went down with an awful
crash in the third Test at Adelaide, and yet many
people heaved a sigh of relief that it was not as
bad as it promised to be. The Australian XI fell
like a crowd of schoolboys for 133 in the first in-
nings; and then the M.C.C. jumped at the Aus-
tralian bowling, and smote it to the horizon for
501. The Australian XI pulled itself together a
little, however, in the second attempt, and managed
to lift 476, leaving the English only 109 to get to
win The deficit was wipeu out by the accumula-
tion of 112 for the loss of three wickets. This
seven-wicket victory gave England two out of the
three Tests that have been played, and “the Ashes”
are in grave danger.
In the whole three of the Tests Clem Hill won
the toss, and thus had his choice throughout the
series, so the downfalls at Melbourne and Adelaide
cannot be charged to fate. The bowling records of
the third Test should be framed and hung in every
Association room for a warning how not to do it.
Cotter, five wickets for 146 (and he’s talking
strike!); Hordern, three for 175; Kelleway, two
for 54; Matthews, one for 96. Australian cricket
high-priests should set forth on the quest of the (
Holy Bowler! Immediately the XI had fallen a
hoarse roar for the return of M. A. Noble went up,
but it soon fell flat. Noble retired from representa-
tive cricket after getting badly hurt in the previous
bumping match with the Board of Control. A more
sensible idea would be to give some of the promis-
ing colts a show, and there is greater chance of
bright young players flashing into wondrous doings
than of retired veterans coming back at the age ot
37 and saving the country. As far as the
third Test is concerned, Australia apparently wants
a new team, lock, stock and barrel; but, speaking
by and large, it is the bowling that is weak; and
until the selection committee can unearth some
mighty trundlers, there doesn’t seem much chance ot
pulling the rubber out of the fire.
* * * *
“Adelaide”; Without going too much by
a single match, and without whipping the cat m any
way, it looks as if Australia hasn’t got any bowlers
worth relying on. Whitty did the work last year,
and, apparently, his appendicitis operation has dam-
aged him. Hordern seems to be dangerous only
while unknown; since the first Test he has been
played without much difficulty. Cotter may always
take some wickets —expensively, like all last
bowlers. Armstrong is no longer feared, and the rest
in sight are in the “useful” class. England s last
three totals speak for themselves: 219 for two wic-
kets; 501 and 112 for three wickets. On English
turf any of our bowlers may do well, but there are
two more Tests here to face. Writer would like to
see Hazlitt and Macartney go in. The lest m Ade-
laide was lost on the first day. It was about the
slowest day’s batting on record. It was also Aus-
tralia’s worst day for years. May there not be some
connection between those two facts? Anyway, that
day’s form was all wrong, and may be disregarded.
We have any quantity of batting, while England has
a distinct tail. All we can hope is to worry them
all out somehow — and hit up more runs than they do.
* * * *
An amazing statistician, with Barnes on
the brain, has supplied Melbourne Argus with a
table showing the remarkable influence ot Barnes in
all matches he has played in against the members ot
the Australian team engaged in the Third lest, in
elusive of the first innings of the match Irom
this laborious compilation it appears that Clem Hill,
Ransford, Bardsley and Trumper have been very sus-
ceptible to Barnes, owing their aggregate downfall
to his bowling 32 times out of 70. On the other
hand, Armstrong, Cotter, Carter, Kelleway and Hor-
dern have rarely been slain by Barnes possibly be
cause they lost their wickets before he could get at
them, or perhaps because they have nerves of a ch -
ferent sort, and one man’s Barnes is another man
poison. The blessed Barnes table boils down to
this: Barnes had taken 33£ p.c. ot the wickets (not
counting run outs) ; which boils down to the further
fact that the other English bowlers, as a rule, have
not been sufficiently deadly to prevent Barnes having
all these wickets to take. Either Barnes is a lot more
deadly than the other bowlers, or the other bowlers
are a lot less deadly than Barnes. You can read it
either way.
* * * *
“D.”: I hewed this out of an evening
paper last night: “Owing to his injured arm, Hor-
dern was unable to attend his business to-day. There
is some doubt about his playing in the Fourth Test.
He will give the selectors a definite decision in a
few days. Victor Trumper, who was injured in the
Third Test at Adelaide, has not yet returned to Syd-
ney. He is resting in Melbourne. There is no like-
lihood of his playing in next Friday’s inter-State
match on the Sydney Cricket Ground. Macartney
has now recovered from the injury to his head, and
Warren Bardsley’s injured ribs are giving him little
trouble.” And Ransford is a fifth cripple. Things
I would like to know are: (1) Can anyone cite me
five champion boxers who have been physically in-
capacitated in the last three months as a result of
following their profession? (2) Are the Wowsers
going to start a campaign against the grand old Eng-
lish sport of cricket, on the score of its dangers to
life and limb ; and if not, why not ?

S. Aus. tried two lads in its last Sheffield
Shield match —Steele, captain of Prince Alfred Col-
lege, and Murray, captain of St. Peter’s team last
season. Steele’s average last season in B grade was
134.4, including one 231 not out. Murray (average,
over 50), is a tall fellow, standing nearly 6ft. 3m.,
and he makes use of his height. Against N.S.W. he
scored 48 and 36, and S.A. has visions of another
champion. He is a useful bowler, too, but did not
find his length against N.S.W.
* * * *
The end of the seventh round of First
Grade cricket in Sydney, on Saturday last, saw the
bat make rather a feeble showing, in spite of the fact
that three centuries were on the list. J. S. Taylor,
of Burwood, smote 182 against Sydney, and Law and
Scott, both of Petersham, pounded up 138 and 130
respectively against Paddington. But consider the
bowling figures, and how they run. A. Rough, of
Petersham, bagged four Paddington wickets for 12
runs. Kerim, the Syrian of Redfern, captured foui
Gordon wickets at a cost of 35 runs. Mailey, also of
Redfern, took the other five Gordon wickets for 47.
Follcard, the Balmain wonder, raked in seven Glebe
wickets for 71, in addition to carrying his bat for
60. Dowd, of Paddington, smashed three Petersham
sticks for 38. Stack, of University, collared nine
Middle Harbor men for 117 runs. Law, of Peter-
sham, downed three of Paddington for 40 runs.
Emery, of Redfern, took eight Gordon wickets for
107. Redfern was the star combination of the day,
and having declared with eight wickets down for
456, it demolished Gordon for 165 and 94, thus win-
ning by an inning's and 197 runs. Balmain, with 192
in the first innings, managed to get Glebe out for
172, and thus won by 20 on the first call. Sydney,
having bashed 394 for the loss of seven wickets, de-
cided to go for something great, and sent Burwood
in to bat. Burwood recorded 386 for the loss of seven
wickets, and time running out, the game ended in a
draw. University, having piled up 342, felt reason-
ably safe for a full point win, when Middle Harbor
replied with only 180. But the effort to get the enemy
out quickly in the second innings failed, and only
eight wickets had fallen for 130 when time ran out.
So University had to be content with a first innings
win by 162 runs. A man who played a daring game
was the captain of Petersham. Paddington had 122
on the board when Petersham went in, and ran up to
297 for the loss of six wickets. Then the Petersham
captain declared the innings closed. It was Pad-
dington’s evil day, and Petersham’s notable bowlers,
Rough and Law, got it down and fell upon it. The
side vanished for a miserable 74, and Petersham was
on top with an innings and 101 runs to spare. North
Sydney, with 381, proved too many for Waverley by
97 runs on the first time of asking. The cemetery
suburb made only 284.
* * * *
The sixth round of Melbourne Pennant
cricket, concluded on Saturday, was like its Pjn-
decessors, only more so —a lashing around of hefty
bat-wielders, a piling up of runs and a one-innings
j or a draw. The bowler that Australia, and
especially the Weary State, wants still dwells in
modest retirement. As for premiership prospects,
none of the clubs got damaged, though Northcote,
in putting up a paltry 286 against ’Wood s more
paltry 214, fared better than it deserved. P ran,
flying the 1911 pennant, and virtually the strongest
team in the competition, left some more of its
reputation in the dust by gathering in but 198 runs
to North’s 200. Richmond had beaten St. Kilda
when only five of its wickets were down, ultimately
closing the rout with 287 to Saints’ 181. The colli-
sion of East and South, though neither has better
than a dog’s chance of the pennant, was a consid-
erable and well-patronised struggle. With the aid
of 97 from Peter McAlister and 78 from ex-inter-
Stater E. Y. Carroll, East acquired 283. None of
Harry Trott’s men did much in reply save W. Scott,
but he made 220 off his own little stick, and when
the discussion ceased South’s total was 356, a con-
siderable feat against the bowling of Laver, McDon-
ald, Braid, Parsons and co. Fitzroy, with 123 from
Colin McKenzie and 121 from veteran Chris Kier-
nan, having put together 310 for five wickets on
Saturday week, declared, and gave Essendon a
whole afternoon to match the tally, or go under.
Though it lost the first three wickets for 13 runs,
the ’Dons rose to the occasion, and, With 58 from
Proud and 103 from Pat Shea, put up 239 before
stumps were drawn. It is good to close your in-
nings when you think you have the game safe, but
it is possible to be too previous at times, and Roy
very nearly did it. The Melbourne-Carlton dis-
turbance didn’t count in the scheme of things, but
was punctuated by a pleasing 124 from the bat of
Harry Sandford, a youth of 19,. with the finished
style and gay insouciance of manner of poor Harry
Graham. He just previously made 153 against St.
Kilda, and as he bats with a sort of reckless irrele-
vance, annoying to a bowler but joyous to a
spectator, it is to be hoped he will continue the
good work.
* * * *
It looks as though the English team’s
bowlers aren’t of much account when Barnes
and Foster are away. Both these two were “rest-
ing” in the Geelong and Ballarat matches, and
each time the locals put up a good fight against the
international eleven. The Ballarat 15 was purely
local, excepting the two Maryborough cracks, M.
and E. Herring, uncle and nephew. The latter, who is
this year’s Vic. Rhodes scholar, put together 55,
while his uncle exactly equalled Liddicutt’s Geelong
score against the same team, viz., 129, before being
caueht and bowled by Iremonger. Whatever the
bonding may be all the batting talent of the Weary
State doesn’t dwell Melbourne. #
Plaving for South Brisbane (Q.) against
Valley, on Saturday, Alan Marshall smote mightily,
and compiled 143 in a total of 196 for three wickets
The tally included 13 hits worth six runs apiece ; and
the effort was as refreshing as cold beer in Tim-
buctoo.
* * *
Victoria has three colts well in the run-
ning for larger honors in the cricket roll M. Her-
ring, who crossed the path of the M.C.O. last week-
end, and scored 129 in a total of 318 his fifth
successive century this season; Liddicutt, who smote
129 (out of 277) against M.C.C. recently, at Gee-
long; and E. McDonald, given a place in the Vic-
torian team against N.S.W. this week. McDonald
is a hurricane bowler of great promise, and, in the
dearth of trundlers, is regarded as the hope of the
Murray Staters.

Swimming records are being chopped
mercilessly this season. In the 880yds. N.S.W. pro-
fessional championship, at Leichhardt (Sydney), last
week, O. Dickman won in llmin. 18sec.—19sec. bet-
ter than the world’s professional record belonging to
Englishman D. Billington. Dickman’s time is also
20 2-ssec. faster than amateur W. Longworth’s effort
in the N.S.W. championship a week or so ago ; and
the win was so easy that it appeared that even more
could have been clipped off the record without much
exertion. As showing the rush for the cash in League
swimming, the 50.yds. handicap, of £lO 10s., at the
same meeting, had an entry of 117 a fact which
speaks loudly for the love of the money rather than
the teapot.

The Victorian invention for the improve-
ment of chassis suspension, mentioned in this page
a few weeks back, has proved itself sufficiently to
make money talk. An English company is being
formed, with a capital of £200,000, to operate the
British rights; the French have already been se-
cured, and the German will be taken over by a
sauerkraut combination of equal financial tonnage.
Boiled down, the invention is a device whereby the
vertical shocks are deflected to the direction of travel.
How it is , done this deponent knoweth not; but,
judging by the reports of men like Lamplough,
Napier, Remington and Maudsley, the blessed car
fitted with the new arrangement can jump the street
kerb, and do all sorts of bounding evolutions, with-
out the occupants feeling any inconvenience. Riding
on a chassis suspended according to the new revela-
tion is said to be like sailing along in a boat, no
matter how rough the road is. If it can stand the
wear and tear, and put up anything like a decent life,
then the pneumatic tyre on motor-cars is in its
last days. It is understood that Harry B. James,
of the Dunlqp Rubber Co., will shortly drive a car of
the new device from Adelaide to Melbourne, with a
view to finding out how it will stand wear and stress,
and his report will be eagerly awaited.

The third contest between the 14-footers
of Westralia, Queensland and N. S. Wales took place
on the waters of Port Jackson on Saturday last. The
weather was ideal, the wind light and from the
south-east —the sort of wind that taxes the ingenuity
of the master-mariner to get the best out of it. At
the fall of the fifth flag seven boats were streaking
away, and of these two represented Westralia and
Queensland, while five upheld the cause of Ma. There
would have been six representatives of Ma, only St.
George, the holder of the title, carried away her mast
before the race started, and drifted a wreck on to
the lee shore of Clarke Island, fortunately without
loss of life. Waratah, of Queensland, and Etna, of
Westralia, were the last to get away. It soon
became evident that the Botany Bay boat,
Rene, was going to be among the placed
craft. Although flying no extras it danced away
from the fleet with the Queenslander—a wonderful
mass of canvas, top-sail, sninnaker and ring-tail; —
coming very fast indeed. There was some ambiguity
in the instructions regarding what constituted the
rounding mark, and an alternative having been men-
tioned in case of removal of the rounding mark,
some of the boats went round both of them, and
thereby lost a little time. The race was actually a
long stern chase of Rene by the Queensland ship,
the crew of which displayed wonderful skill in the
handling of canvas. Rene romped home with 33sec.
to spare from \varatah, and Sydney was in the third
place. It was a great race. Rene was so much the
faster boat that the splendid skill of the Queensland
crew could not wipe out the difference.

The world’s best all-round cyclist, A. J.
Clarke, of Australia, is back again in his native land,
to ride with A. J. Davies in the Melbourne Six-Day
Race. His travels abroad have made him wider and
thicker than when he went away, and he brings with
him an American wife. Also, he is much more like
a Yankee than an Australian. Three times he has
finished second to Frank Kramer, the sprinting king,
but then Kramer is not the all-round man that
Clarke is. In addition to three times running second
in the sprint championship of America, Clarke has
won two six-day races at Madison Square Gardens,
and one in Germany (the first held there). He will
be in Melbourne till the end of February, and be seen
again on the track in Sydney in March.
* * * *
N.S.W. League of Wheelmen is able to
stand up again without props, last season’s efforts
having yielded a credit balance of £lOO. With
the life which the six-days’ race awakened in the
pastime, it seems possible that “boom” days may
yet return to N.S.W. professional cycling.
* * * *
Chief Justice Stout, of Maoriland, is a
supporter of the feeble Wowser fiction that the tote
on the racecourse only is a more widespread incentive
to betting than the metallician who lays odds every-
where. “He believes that if Australia abolished the
bookmaker, and replaced him by the totalisator,
gambling would not decrease, but increase.” This is
a “belief” that exists on the impossibility of pro-
ducing direct proof of its falseness. The takings of
the tote are bound to swell as the population of a
State increases, and the racing improves in honesty,
owing to the abolition of bookmakers. Turf gamb-
ling becomes more attractive because it is less harm-
ful. The losses of punters are much less, on the
average, under a tote system, than when the “books”
had the robbing of them. Whereas a large amount of
public capital has to be put through the machine
many times before it is all lost to the public, the same
amount is not infrequently swallowed by the books
at one gulp. South Australia offers trustworthy
figures re the gambling evil. If Robert Stout wants
information re the difference between the results of
racing before and after the legalising of the tote in
S.A. some 20-odd years ago, he can get it from the
police records. There was a big drop in the number
of prosecutions for embezzlement as soon as the
temptation to “shop” and credit betting was removed
by the substitution of the ready-money machine, on
racecourses only, for the bookmaker who gave credit
and plied his trade all over the place.
* * * *
“Snorter”: The maligned penciller doesn’t
always have it entirely his own way. Scrutinise, for
example, the following analysis of the six events
at Aspendale Park (Vic.) on a recent Saturday:—
Where
Number First
of Favorite
Runners. Winner. Finished.
Ist Division Handicap 18 2nd favorite Third
2nd , 23 Ist ~ First
3rd ”, „ 24 2nd ,) Second
Steeplechase 10 Ist •> (evens) First
Park Handicap 9 2nd ~ Thud
Jumpers’Flat 17 Ist ~ First
The average number of runners for each paltry stake
was 17, yet in every case the winner had started
first or second favorite, and in no case was the
actual first favorite unplaced. Eighty of the horses
were treated as nonentities by the professional back-
ers. And they ran accordingly. Only in one race —
the Steeplechase—did a rank outsider get placed,
and when the fields were largest, the betting was the
surest guide to the results. Such occurrences lend an
air of verisimilitude to the banshee-like moans that
Isaac Mo. emits concerning his hard life, and the way
everyone’s hand is against him, and the miserably
scant hopes he has of expiring in a state of solvency.
* * * *
The record totalisator figures, at the
Auckland (M.L.) meeting, recently, yielded £4422
to the coffers of the M.L. Government—a sum not
to be ignored by the Treasurer in making ends
meet.
The Kangaroo Rugby League footballers
got a taste of Fogland, last week, when a match
was abandoned owing to the playing-ground being
under snow. What a grand place England is for
the absent inhabitant —especially in winter! Of
the 33 matches played by the Kangaroos during their
wanderings, 27 have been won, four lost and two
drawn —a rather substantial record.
* * * *
Luck put up a great battle for Frank
Thorn at his second meeting with Billy Elliott, in
Melbourne, the other evening. When this brace
brought off their first mutual assault, Thorn secured
a victory on points, but a skinful of trouble went
with it, and it was reckoned he had nothing to cut
to waste when Elliott faced him again. The fight
produced 34 minutes of vivacious bruising, and then
Elliott collapsed. It seemed at first that Thorn had
fouled him out, but medical experts reported an
organic injury, the result of a twist, entirely Elliott’s
own doing. So Frank took the bundle, and went
home, and Billy went to the surgery. There are just
101 ways of getting licked in a fight. Elliott has
brought the 101st to light.
* * * *
The disturbance between Hugh Mehegan
and Yankee-Italian Picato, at Sydney Stadium, on
Saturday night, was a hard-fought affair. Practically
every round ended with Mehegan on top. Still,
although overmatched, Picato was always dangerous,
right up to the 16th round, when he fizzled out and
spent all his energy and skill in avoiding a knock-
out. He got through.
* * * *
Yankee fighter “Porky” Flynn (what a
name!) has had a bad time since he arrived in Aus-
tralia. A poisoned finger gave him much pain and
prevented him doing anything startling in the way
of putting a head on his brother pug, and final!v it
was found necessary to perform an amputation. The
bone has been removed half-way down to the second
joint, and “Porkv” will scrap with Bandsman Rice
on the night of February 3, at Sydney Stadium.
* * * *
Dago-Yankee bruiser Joe Grimm, who
created much amusement in Australia some years
ago, was supposed to be dead. But it seems he is
still swimming around, and, when last heard from,
was in Portland (U.S.A.) A flagpole snapped, and
the wreck landed on Grimm’s head. People rushed
to his assistance, but he merely scratched the place,
and remarked he had been hit much harder than that,
and walked off to have a banana.
* * * *
Jim Barry, the Chicago heavyweight at
present in Sydney seeking trouble, is, like Henry
Irving, a student of crime, and is generally regarded
as one of the best amateur detectives in the U.S.A.
The Pinkerton Private Police organisation has made
repeated efforts to get him on its staff, but Barry
clings stubbornly to the biffing life, on account of
its freedom and big money. Barry is a curious mix-
ture, with Irish, French and Indian blood in his
veins. He is a sort of human haggis.

“K.”: Re par. (B. 18/1/’l2) concerning
the thickness of the Amurkan nigger’s lid.
Johnson recentlv submitted to having an X-ray
photo, of his ceiling taken, and the results are stag-
gering. The common, or garden skull is from one-
eighth to, in extreme cases, a half-inch thick. John-
son’s dome varies from iin. to Jin. The time for
photographing an ordinary skull is five to 15sec.; but
it took the X-rays 5 § minutes to make a picture of
the champion pug.’s inside thinking apparatus. John-
son has a brain-box of exceptional size, and it is so
thickly armored that nothing short of a 14in. gun
would make an impression on it.
* * * *
“Bilbaker”: Boxing is having an up and
down time of it in England. Certain contests were
prevented by the authorities, and the “kidney punch”
declared illegal. But the limit was reached in a
match at Sheffield, between Alf Langford (said to be
a cousin of Sam’s) and Gunner Healy. In the eleventh
round the police inspector put the plug in, on the
ground that Langford was not boxing, only trying
for a “knock out.” Boxing contests are “off” now
in the cutlery city.
HEARTBURN.
DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS
FOUND MOST EFFECTIVE FOR
THIS DISTRESSING COMPLAINT.
Heartburn is a symptom of Indigestion,
and consists of a most distressing and gnaw-
ing pain in the stomach, often with sour, acid
belchings, nauseau and fainting.. When the
food is only partially digested, it gives rise
Mr. E. B. Garland.
From a photo.
to an accumulation of
wind or gas generated
from the excess of
acidity from the imper-
fectly-digested food. To
overcome this com-
plaint, plain food should
be taken sparingly, and
a course of Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills, which
will strengthen the di-
gestive organs and re-
move all acidity from
the stomach. These
pills do not merely al-
leviate the trouble,
but get at the cause,
and thus permanently
overcome the trouble.
Mr. E. B. Garland. “Henbury, Ruthven
Street, Waverley, Sydney, states:—-lor
some considerable time I have suftered
greatly from Heartburn, Indigestion and
Liver and Ividnev Troubles, and at times
the pain would be very great. I was recom-
mended by a friend to try Dr. Morses In-
dian Root Pills. I started on a course, and
found on continuing that they gave me great
relief, and, although I have had a return ot
the symptoms, a dose of Dr. Morse s Indian
Root Pills never fails to put me right, and
restore me to health again We always
keep a bottle handy in case of need. I have
pleasure in sending you this testimo y,
which you may use as you think proper. 1
have recommended Dr. Morse s Indian Root
Pills to many friends, who now always use
them.”

Tormenting Itching and a Shocking

the tormenting: itching,
was a misery to the poor
child and a shocking
sight. She had to stop
away from school for
six months and I was
really frightened she
would never get better.
I tried everything people
would advise me, but
none of them nor any
doctor’s advice did hny
good till one day I saw
your advertisement of
Cuticura and I sent for the Ointment and also
bought, some later on which I applied to her
head and neck and before -very long the itch-
ing ceased and the ringworms all disappeared,
within five weeks from the time I commenced
using the Cuticura Ointment. My little girl
tells everybody how she Was cured of the
ringworms she had.
“I gave some of the Ointment to a lady
next door for her baby and she tells me it
has cured her little head of the itch it had.
“I cannot tell you how thankful I am to
the cure bv Cuticura Ointment nor can I
speak too highly of same when I' think ofthe
ringworms my little girl had. (Signed) Mrs.
Fletcher, 81 Bellview Street, North Sydney,
N. S'. W., Dec. 17, 1910.

“Exile”: I’ve just got home from the
Outer Darkness to God’s own country. At
Adelaide I bought a paper, and noticed that
seven bachelors of laws and 36 new doctors
had been indicted by Madden, C.J., at Mel-
bourne University. They are all learning
the wrong things: Our ship brought six
gas-engineers under contract to permanent
billets ; three of them are to get over £5OO a
year for seeing that coal is properly stoked
at one end and brought out as gas at the
other. Another highly-paid man goes to
Lithgow to test rails for the Government.
Surely we Australians can do all our own
gas-inspecting and rail-inspecting ourselves.
We don’t, by the way, seem to use the 36
doctors to inspect immigrants, as we had
four consumptives and one case of g.p. on
board, and they ai. .all likely to land, as the
medical inspection of immigrants is a huge
farce.
Listen to the hysteria of the cable news
distender as he tells of Calcutta’s final out-
break of “loyalty” to King George. This is
from the Melbourne Argus :
Preparations for the event had been in progress
for months. The native princes of 30 States had
brought their armies of retainers and their herds of
trained elephants and tuskers, camels, and dancing
horses. The .great line of color included 57 elephants
and tuskers, and 35 camels, all being richly capari-
soned.
In short, each prince brought an innumer-
able herd of one elephant and most of an-
other, and raised the dust as far as the re-
motest horizon with one camel and one-sixth
of another camel. As to the dancing horses,
their number isn’t given. But the Mahara-
jah of Jeypore used to be one of the horsiest
of India’s native nrinces, and when this
writer had the blessed privilege of inspect-
ing his stable, he had one dancing animal.
It was really, a pony, and it simply threw up
its hind legs when it was tickled and waved
its tail in an unimportant sort of way.
The Argentine correspondent of the S. M.
Herald told the old paper the other day
that labor was going to be very scarce dur-
ing the coming harvest, and wages would
probably be as much as 14s. per day. He
explained that this dreadful calamity was
due to the railway cos. chopping down wages
a while ago, and the consequent “numerous
departure of laborers from the country.”
Fat rarely has had a more annoying state-
ment thrown at him. Hitherto, the mono-
poly of leaving the country has always been
the pet possession of bloated capital. To
know that common labor can do the same
thing is most embarrassing. In fact, the
Argentine cockies who have to pay 14s. a
day might find it less beastly inconvenient if
sacred capital booked its passage by the first
lugger.
Australia is beginning, in a small way, to
follow the U.S.A. in the matter of outland-
ish new religions. The latest upheaval was
the inauguration of the Order of the Star of
the East, in Phillip-street, Sydney, near the
head office of the police. It burst into sud-
den life with a local membership of over 200
and a lot of outside support. It is a curious
sect, which believes in the coming of a Great
Teacher, and throws cold water on the Judg-
ment Day, explaining that all these intricate
matters of worthiness of immortality are
settled by a slow, cold process of evolution.
Like produces like, and the sum total of it
weighs down the balance, and the chance of
eternal life is lost, and the soul that has lost
it begins to degenerate, sliding horribly from
the man to the pig, from the pig to the rep-
tile, the reptile to the slug, the slug to some
baser form of semi-nervous life, and thence
to the inorganic. Thus a cabbage may be
an ex-king of bad character, jit is a sort of
revival of the Order of the Rosy Cross, the
members of which were known _ as Rosi-
crucians, who sought the Philosopher’s
Stone, and the secret of physical immortal-
ity. The modern crowd has abandoned the
idea of physical immortality, and postpones
the taking on of the eternal form to the next
stage of existence. These immortalities are
an amusing crowd, and people who almost
die of ennui on a wet Sunday contemplate
the tragedy of the shoreless ages of eternity
with the utmost equanimity.
By “Henri Singemoine” :
The world is full of cant, and every now and then
a fresh variety of the horror is born. For example,
of late, worthy old gentlemen and others have been
remarking thoughtfully that boxing is being “ruined
by the money element.” “Leave it alone and it will
kill itself,” they say sternly, with all the air of one
who has, after severe labor, resolved a huge sociolo-
gical puzzle. When they are asked why big money
should kill boxing any more than it has killed cricket
(where the cash question is more clamant now than
ever before) or football, or aeroplaning, or horse-
racing, or pigeon-shooting at Monte Carlo, or bill-
iards, or a thousand other sports where the par-
ticipants stand to rake in anything from £5OO to
£5OOO as a reward for their labors, the oldsters bury
themselves in the tomb of a dead silence. The reason
is that there is no answer available. One of the
manv differences between boxing as it exists to-day,
and boxing as it was half a century ago, lies in the
fact that where once it was the privilege of the
affluent few to witness a boxing bout, it is now pos-
sible for anyone to do so who has a few shillings to
spare. Naturally, the boxer earns more money, just
as the modern music-hall star, who plays weekly to
thousands at half. a dozen different houses, com-
mands 20 times as much as the Lion Comique who
diverted the patrons of one small hall with a seating
capacity of a couple of hundred.
The blither about the objectionableness of the
money-element as regards boxing, is, when it comes
to be considered in all its bearings, simply a move-
ment in the direction of underpaying the pugilist.
London Winning Post, which voices the sentiments
of the National Sporting Club, where the pug. has
always been sweated, came out frankly, the other
week, with a cry of longing for the good old era
when fighters accepted, with thanks, whatever was
offered to them; and it wound up with the aspiration
that the day of “mushroom promoters” would soon
end. There is about as much likelihood of this hap-
pening as there is of a reversion to Feudalism. The
wares of the skilled boxer have the same fixed value
in the world’s market as the novels of Marie Corelli
or the art of Little Tich. No amount of argument,
no frantic appeals to his better feelings will ever
make Jack Johnson extend himself in the hempen
square for a ten-pound note, a pot of beer, and the
privilege of having his vast and loathly paw shaken
by a peer—as his 18th century prototype used gladly
to do. , ,
But the black calamity .will box no less well and
honorably for that. It is indisputable that, for good
behavior, in and out of the Ring, the present-day
pug. fairly loses his brother of the bare-knuckle
period—when it was the fashion among Right-
thinkers to refer to pugilism as one of “old Eng-
land’s glories.” Also, the modern boxing crowds are
considerably more orderly and decent than the crowds
of yore, who, when the man that was winning didn’t
happen to have been backed by, them, mostly outed
him with a fusillade of bricks and bottles.
I hereby move that the snuffle about the sport of
boxing being “destroyed,” because a race of business
men has arisen who pay the performers what they
are worth, be leapt on with scorn whenever it makes
its appearance. As well say that the superb old
pastime of Devil-harassing is on the wane because
the champions or archbishops of the business make

There are many sizes of
“ Semelle ” Non-skids
■—but there is only one quality.
Quality is the predominant characteristic of our tyres.
We are students in the science of Tyre Culture ; and our efforts
are constantly directed towards the improvement of the already high
standard we have set.
Quality has gained the leadership for us ; and there is no keener
recognition than our own of the fact that only by the continuance of
Quality can we hold that leadership.
It is a well-known saying that “ imitation is the sincerest form of
flattery, and the fact that many of our competitors have tried to copy
our Semelle nonrskid is a conclusive proof that the principles are right.
It is, however, just that extra touch of supreme quality which distinguishes
our Semelle from the commonalty c
If you have not already tried one, get your stockist to supply you
with a Michelin “ Semelle.” It is the finest non-skid on the market.

SCOTT’S
Emulsion
Mrs. Conna Gray, 13 Earl St.,
Darlinghurst, Sydney, N.S.W.,
writes (18th Nov. ’O9) :
“After each bottle of Scott’s Emulsion
jkjkjk
my daughter, Rebe, 22
months old, was noticeably
stronger. Delicate from
birth, she suffered with
nasty colds and bronchitis,
and although various treat-
ments were tried, she made
no progress until I gave her
Scott’s Emulsion. She
then rapidly improved, and
very shortly was quite cured of the colds
and. bronchitis, and in splendid health.”
These successes, repeated
season after season, have
given Scott’s Emulsion a
reputation in all parts of
the world, a reputation
which no other emulsion
than Scott’s possesses.
No other emulsion has ever
received the cordial appro-
val of the medical and nurs-
ing professions the world
over. No emulsion, bought
instead of Scott’s, can give
you the proof which Scott’s
provides. This CERTAINTY
should be worth many times
the price of Scott’s Emul-
sion. Therefore, don’t ask
for “emulsion”—ask for
SCOTT’S EMULSION.

THE DREAD
OP FOOD
GIVES PEACE TO
GOOD APPETITE
AND GOOD DIGESTION
WHEN YOU TAKE
The dread of food—becatise of the pains that follow, the dull
weight in your stomach, the windy pressure round your heart —
is a natural consequence of indigestion. This all-too-common
complaint consumes your strength, wastes away your tissues
and breaks down your nerves. Thousands of people are worn
out, weary, weak and disheartened by the ravages of indigestion
and its kindred complaints, biliousness and constipation. When
that is your condition, don’t despair, for you can certainly be
cured by Mother Seigel’s Syrup. It has cured more people of
stomach and liver troubles, pains after eating, loss of appetite,
headaches, biliousness and constipation than any other medical
preparation that is before the public. Test it yourself!
THE DIGESTIVE TONIC
Mr. J. Higgins, 18, Atherton Street, Fitzroy, Vic., says:—“l
had headaches, was very costive, and suffered from terrible pains
in the stomach after eating. I could only take a little of the
lightest nourishment, and even that was frequently rejected. I
lost all my strength, decreased very much in weight, and I had
to give up work.
“ After giving ordinary medicines a fair trial, I had to give
them up. I then began a course of Mother Seigel’s Syrup. After
taking only three bottles of the Syrup I was back to my work
a well man. I was cured, and have kept well ever since.”

The Inky Way.
That industrial agreement which the Australian
Journalists’ Association has made with the newspaper
proprietors is going to have a lot of effects. Up till
now, a very few of the big morning papers have
monopolised the best men, because they alone paid a
decent wage. Now, a “log” rate has been fixed for
all papers in the large cities, so the best men are
no longer forced to look only to a little group of
bosses. They can choose those which require the least
work for the standard wage, and those offices where the
conditions all round are most pleasant. Also, the
best newspaper staffs in future will not be found on
the morning papers, for very few men will work on
a morning daily when they can get almost the same
money on an afternoon rag. The evening papers,
recognising this, are hastening to secure the pick of
the men from the morning papers. Thus the morning
paper proprietaries are liable to presently find them-
selves with the fag ends of their own staffs and the
discards of the evening papers—unless they decide to
pay considerably above log rates, and accept reduced
profits.

One of the curiosities of the Australian inky way
is the Nobden, which has been circulating among
the Danes, Swedes and Norwegians of Australia for
the past 15 years, and lately felt strong enough to
break out into a special Christmas number, with an
eye to a foreign circulation. The principal article,
well illustrated, was by Jens Lyng, the author of a
book or two, who says to the Scandinavian: “If
you’re thinking of immigrating, try Australia. It’s
as good as any country in the world and better than
most.” Ordinarily, the Nor den is a sort of fort-
nightly news-letter, very handy for the hardy Norse-
men to drop into the post to tell the old fjord how
the new world is treating Oscar and Olaf and Martha
and little Thyra.

“Tired Pressman”: Prank Foster, M.H.R., is re-
ported to have interjected during the “signed
articles” debate on the Electoral Bill, “They are
hired assassins”—meaning the men who dig bread
and dripping with the pen-point. I’m fervently sick
of this sort of muck from Labor politicians. I’ve
heard it too often during a harried press career.
Come, now, what is Foster’s own position ? As a
Labor member he supports a Government which
supplies Tory newspapers with telephones, telegrams
and a postal service. If the “hired assassin” is in
Melbourne, and the paper whose opinions he puts
into words is in Sydney, that Government will cheer-
fully carry the message; and Foster supports it, and
supplies it with the authority necessary to do this
service.

“L.F.H.” : T. H. S. Escott’s book on British journal-
ism, just published by Fisher Unwin (London), is far
and away the best and most exhaustive so far pub-
lished. His researches have carried him back far
beyond the invention of printing. The war corre-
spondent was the first journalist. He flourished in
the times of Thucydides, Xenophon, Julius
Caesar and Livy. During the Wars of the
Boses in England, there was an indefati-
gable news-collector named Fenn, who organ-
ised a staff of correspondents, and was thus enabled
to bring out a weekly manuscript journal, for which
he had a considerable number of regular subscribers.
Rivals followed in Fenn’s footsteps, and several
manuscript newspapers came into being. Also, lead-
ing families kept a “newsman” upon the domestic
staff. It was his duty, when they were away from
home or travelling, to keep them well informed as to
what was happening. But the undoubted father of
journalism, as we now understand the word, was
Daniel Defoe, best known as the author of “Robinson
Crusoe.” By his tremendous intellectual vigor he
made journalism a real political power with the
people at large. As Escott says, he “wanted for him-
self the positions of editor, publisher, political
writer, social and literary critic.” His paper circu-
lated in all the London coffee houses and taverns, and
was carried home to be read by the wives and
daughters. Defoe paved the way for Addison and
Steele, who were followed by Smollett, Wilkes, Leigh
Hunt and Coleridge.

“Penman”: Here is a matter which I submit to
my fellow journeymen-journalists, with full confidence
of a unanimous verdict in my favor. I contracted to
write a lengthy article for £1 a column. The news-
paper proprietor thought so highly of it that he
“leaded” every line, and thus it made six columns.
My bill was for £6, but I could only get £3. “Oh,”
says the proprietor, “the leading is my business; it
has nothing to do with you. You didn’t expect it,
did you?” “I did not contract for £3, but for £1
a column, whatever it might make,” says I. But I
might as well have talked to the type. Sancho
Panza said you must take the boss’s verdict, and sit
down to dinner. But Sancho Panza didn’t know; quite
as much about trades unionism and the like as we do
to-day.

A SHORT WAY WITH EDITORS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Constantinople, Tuesday Evening.—lsmail Faik
Bey, a journalist, has been bastinadoed. for the pub-
lication of an article criticising the “overbearing atti-
tude” of the Committee of Union and Progress.
The father of Ismail, who is the editor of an An-
gora newspaper, has been arrested for publishing an
open letter of protest, being whipped senseless.
Similar acts of tyranny have occurred in other
parts of Turkey.
— Cable.
There isn’t any nonsense of a sentimental kind
About the Turk!
As a rule he’s very thorough when he really puts his
mind
To am' work!
Though he’s weak on sanitation,
Finance, medicine, astronomy—
He holds a lofty station
In political economy.
For he models all his methods on the Book of Deu-
teronomy 1
In Caucasian communities strange lenience is dis-
played
Towards the scribe
Who wields the scathing, scurril pen, and not the
flashing blade,
To flay his tribe!
At least, that’s been the custom
Observed until quite recently;
The scribe might fight like Rustem,
As long as he fought decently.
But the monster Costs devoured him if he ever wrote
malfeasantly !
But such tender, foolish methods never troubled
Abdul Bey-—-
The written word
He treated, like the levelled blow, in his old-
fashioned way,
When it occurred!
Editorial bravado,
In the shape of criticism,
Had to own the bastinado
A more biting witticism—
Abdul’s “ology” with scribes was: We can always
fit his “ism” !
When the Bugle of Angora (as the cables tell us)
wrote
Some hostile views
Of Abdul, he remarked: “We’ll of this person make
a note —
Off with his shoes I”
Whereat they placed that editor
In most distressing attitude,
Who yelled: “I never said it !”—or
“It was but harmless platitude!”
His last words, ere he fainted, were: “Was ever
such ingratitude f”

GOLDENLYTE” MOTOR LAMPS
were used by his Majesty the King at the
Indian Durbar.
They are admittedly the best of all Motor
Lamps.
WHY?
They use only the yellow or more penetra-
tive rays of light, and eliminate the merely
dazzling- violet rays. In other words, they
give a longer and better light than other
lamps. They do away with deep shadows, and
enable a clearer discernment of distant ob-
jects. Their brass work is that solid type of
work and material that one associates with
first-class British goods. Th| v lamps are made
in various sizes and designs. Insist on your
ears being fitted with “Goldenlyte” Lamps.
They are the best, yet cost no more than
others. They will last and please for a life-
time.

IN BANANA LAND
The garrison at Thursday Island —the
small, white force that is supposed to guard
the waterway from the North to the
eastern coast cities of Australia —
bubbled over the other day, and the
office of the little Patriot nearly got boiled
in the process. One of the garrison troops
had been lost on the Cape York mainland,
and had apparently died of thirst or starva-
tion ; whereupon the Patriot was foolish
enough to remark that “the loss of a pros-
pective farm-burner doesn’t matter very
much one way or the other —nowadays.”
Evidently the Patriot hasn’t yet observed
that, so far as Australia is concerned, it is
the other fellow who is likely to do the
farm-burning, and that the Australian de-
fence-man’s job is to keep him from doing
it.
Some 16 or 17 years ago, Queensland
threw one of its best prospective assets —its
Brisbane tramway rights—to. an English
company, and it has been filled ever since
with the cussedness of great joy. The Bris-
bane trams are inadequate, they are not
cheap, and they are not excessively com-
fortable. And manager Badger is some-
thing like N.S.W. Railway Commissioner
Johnson. Just now there is trouble on the
Brisbane trams. A union of employees had
been formed, and the union devised a badge
which the unionists proceeded to wear. Why
the badge should have irritated Badger, any
more than a blue ribbon or a flower, doesn’t
appear; It wasn’t illegal. It didn’t over-
load the cars, and if the extra weight was a
matter of any importance, Badger might
have issued an order that the men who wore
the article should have their hair cut short,
to counterbalance the burden. The fact that
a number of orderly people took an interest
in noting who wore and who didn’t wear the
badge should rather have cheered up Bad-
ger. He should have been glad to see the
streets crowded, that being a matter which
would lead to business. If the crowds be-
came obstreperous that was a matter for the
police—not for Badger. A wise man doesn’t
go looking for trouble, unless there is money
in it. But the Brisbane tramway boss or-
dered that the wearing of badges should
cease, just as he might have ordered the men
to leave off shirts or boots, and started to
plunge round and exhibit himself as the
Strong Man of the situation, if a thing like
that could be called a situation. The result,
so far, is not exactly a lock-out or a strike,
but a very-much-dislocated service, the loss
of a, great many fares, a deal of walking ex-
ercise on the part of the community, and a
very important Badger occupying a position
of uncertain legality. Of course a man
can’t help being Badger if he is born that
way, but a lot of people might prefer to be
J obson.
Brisbane paper :—-
By the Kuranda, which left Innisfail (Geraldton)
for Townsville on Thursday, were 16 Chinese saloon
passengers, and 19 Europeans in the same class.
Down south, whare he is a comparatively
rare fowl, Ah Chow is a deferential creature
who crawls into the dark corner, or
hides on the back perch; but give
him the stiffening that comes with num-
bers, and Ah Chow has no use for any
dark corners or back perches. It’s the
foleign white devil, in the steward’s uniform,
that is the dirt then. Still, the foleign white
devil of Geraldton hasn’t any cause to com-
plain ; for Geraldton is the town where the
foleign white devil long ago contracted the
habit of taking off his hat to the magnificent
yellow person who keeps two joss-houses
going within the one small township.

The Clerical Slog.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At a recent boxing bout at Longreach, the Rev.
Hulton Sams acted as referee ; Father Lane officiated
as timekeeper, and the Rev. C. Hicks as 10 seconds
check. When the Rev. Sams gave his decision for
a draw, some of the audience boo-hooed, and the
referee thereupon invited any who disagreed to step
into the ring with him. No one complied. —News
item.
A time there was when the Church would snort and
Methody leaders sniff
At them who step in the fistic ring and follow the
sinful biff;
But now the cleric will don the gloves and offer a
churchly cheek
To them who smite with a fist of might and bash on
a foeman’s beak.
“Step into the ring with me,
Just put on the gloves,” says he ;
“And the Church will biff till the Flesh is stiff,”
says the Reverend Referee.
If Satan shakes —as> the old hymn says —whenever
he turns and sees
The humblest saint in a prayerful fit drop down on
his contrite knees,
What would he do—and his demon crew —if parson
addressed him thus:
“Rut up. your props in a manly way, and try a few
rounds with us ;
Step into the ling with me,
Just put on the gloves and see
How the Church will biff till the Devil is stiff,” says
the Reverend Referee.
The times march on, and the Church has found that
she must get marching, too,
And train her men for the old “good fight” that
waits for the preacher true;
And whether she slog at the curse of grog, or go for
Apollyon’s tip,
It's Ho! Look out for the parson stout, and ’ware
of his grievous grip!
“Step into the ring with me ;
Just put on the gloves,” says lie,
“And the Church will biff till the world is stiff,”
says the Reverend Referee!

My Dear Thargomindah,—
The parsons still wax fat, and the maker
of wedding rings waneth not. On Monday,
at All Saints’, Miss Ruby Hall discarded
her naihe for that of D’Arcy Winten, and
flitted from the church by motor (driven by
the groom), towards the Northern Rivers,
where the honey-swoon is suspected of lurk-
ing. Everything in the drapery line was
blue, except Miss Winten (one of the maids)
and she was buttercup.
On Wednesday, popular Cecil O’Neil
Brenan was shepherded to St. James’s
Church, Enoggera, by his two best pals, Mr.
Dixon and Mr. Nigel Shand, and there swore
off bachelorhood, with the entire approbation
of Miss Sue Ward, daughter of Duncan of
that ilk. Sister Mollie Brenan and a little
Miss Ward (at present of the kingdom of
fiapperdom) egged on the bride, who was har-
nessed in satin and lace.
On Thursday, St. Stephen’s Cathedral was

BUCOLIC BOWLER (to batsman who for the third time has swiped him for four): “Here,
I say , blokie, let up. You're spoilin' my average!"
self-invited), anxious to see the Beirne-
Hooper union. The bride, who is the eldest
daughter of kindly T. C. Beirne, wore a
gown that caused the tenth commandment to
be obliterated and rendered of no account.
It was fabricated of satin, and lavishly
trimmed or rhymed with exquisite Duchesse
point. The veil was also of Duchesse point,
and the general result was all that the most
calculating bride could do to plant the roots
of envy in sister woman. Four little Beirnes,
in white net with blue-edged frills, kept the
crowd from treading ou the bride; and
Messrs. Charley Bowley and Fred Connah
saw to it that the groom (who was dressed
in dark bagging, or tweed, or something,,
trimmed with white linen and crowned with
head whiskers) did not repent at the last
minute. Afterwards, he was led southward
to your city by his new boss. Amongst the
paternal gifts were a house and a motor-
car.
Still more engagements are rumored, so
evidently Cupid works more than the legal
eight hours a day, or else his marksmanship
is improving. One is'little Miss Grace Mor-
gan to Norman Jeffries, a person with a large
banking account, who hails from the North.
Another is pretty Rita Murpliy, daughter of
the Hon. Peter, to J. Filhelly, at one time an
ardent follower of Rugby.
Things have been very quiet of late'at the
Government Shanty, but his Ex. goes to
Blackall on Monday, and if he paints the
place red I’ll let you know next week.
Agent-General Robinson and his missus
have presented to Premier Denham’s missus
a Queensland opal necklet. Incidentally)
the Robinsons have been visiting a few of
the big homesteads during the past few days.
The Frank Needhams, at Canning Downs,
and the Cressbrook McConnels were on - the
list of eligibles.
“Tommy” Jones, the cheery old clergyman
who is so beloved of all classes and denom-
inations, has had a bout with the pneu-
monia devil, and, at the time of writing,
seems to have gained a certain victory. At
latest, the referee was steadily counting out
the enemy.
Another popular Brisbaneite, Mrs. (Dr.)
Hopkins, has been ou the sick list. She se-
verely strained herself while attempting to
restore a drowned man at Southport during
the year-end holidays, and was for some
time in hospital. She is so far recovered
now that she is putting the finishing touches
to her health in her own home.
A friend of mine, whose wash-up repre-
sentative walks out with the envoy of the
meat hidalgo, tells in tragic tones that
1000 butchers are not only ready, but eager,
to strike in sympathy with the troubled
tramway men. Thank Heaven, I haven t
heard of a Chinese Gardeners’ Union, so
“eabbagee” and the aesthetic turnip may still
grace our tables. At time of writing there
was no information as to what action the
Industrial Union of Imported , Governors
proposes to take; ’but the worst is feared.
The Q.T.C. races were well attended on
Friday, by the Fleeced and the Fleecers.
The glad rags were again of the boiled frock
order, and summery hats of the floral type
shaded the heads of our women.
Local gossip received a severe upper cut
the other day. A well-known man departed
on a business trip to America, and pitiful
tales of his cruel treatment of his weaker
half were sent the rounds before his ship had
slid down the rim of the horizon. Unfortu-
nately, his grass widow got to hear the news,
and in her indignation wound the Law up
to full 'cock. Now the sympathetic scandal-
hawkers are sorry their sympathy was mis-
placed.
Yours affectionately.

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of- communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted, whether sent by post or handed
in; and no MS. will be returned unless stamps
(of any State) accompany.
D.D. : By your account the “average
Australian” is “one of the most blatant and ignor-
ant persons to be found anywhere.” But unless, you
know something yourself you can hardly tell what. is
ignorance and what is not. How much, for in-
stance, do you know? Write it all out on half a
sheet of notepaper. .. .L. 5.8.: (1) A square mile is
an area of 640 acres in any shape. ,A mile square is
640 acres contained within equal lines, with right
angled corners. Also, while a square mile and a
mile square are both 640 acres in extent the resem-
blance ends there. Two square miles are 1280 acres
while two miles square are 2560 acres. (2) It is a
mineral. (3) Merely a matter of opinion.... Ivory:
Please don’t send us parodies in summer. It is too
hard work thinking up sufficiently insulting remarks
to welcome them with Endealite: It sounds
musical, but the meaning is hard to arrive at. It
reminds us of those tender lines which the curate
read to the weeping ladies at the Dorcas meeting:—
Sweet lady mine who glitterest in shimmer of sum-
mer athwart the lawn,
Ganst tell me which is bitterest —the glamor of eve
or the glimmer of dawn ?
... .Rejected: You say that we “know and have
always known that Protection duties have been not
only the bulwark but the very soil and manure that
has grown the landlord,” etc. Is that why the land-
lord is such an amazing institution in Freetrade
Britain? According to the Statesman’s Year Book
there were, in 1909, 509,171 farms in England,
Wales and Scotland, and of these 447,108 were
rented from some loafing landlord or another. On
the other hand, in Protectionist France nearly 60
per cent., and in Protectionist Germany 86 per cent.
of the farmers own the land they cultivate
J.A.A.: All the materials for a good picture in
“Friday Night,” but the work is uneven. .. .S.J.G.:
Dunno K. Pen: “Troubles” has a few splashes of
humor, but not enough to float it in.... The Hack:
“England,” you say, “must be hell, indeed, if it has
anything worse to show than the conditions offered
to immigrants in Australia.” Toss for which
country you know least about. ... Te Pana: Will
assume in all charity that you did not see that
story when it appeared in The Bulletin some time
ago. .. . U.: Believe you when you solemnly declare
the Adam and Eve gags to' be “plain, unadulterated
facts.” They are uninteresting enough to be all
that.... C.H.: Have no record of the two short
poems mentioned. . : .A.R.S.: Sorry not enough in
sketch. May make a par out of facts contained in
letter. . . .N. McL. (V.) : Nothing of any value in the
batch. . . .W.M. (Sydney) : Scotch rhyme fairly in-
genious ; but if we printed it, the contents of the
whole directory would be rhymed and aimed at us.
. ...C.G.: We extract half a dozen stings:—
MOSQUITOES, GIN AND SNAKES.
One hot sultry night in December
I wearily went to my bed
Mosquitoes provoked my ill-temper
As on me they feasted and fed.
My body they freely did puncture
Till large purple pimples arose
Causing a passionate erupture
To shatter my hopes of repose.
Scribe: Regret to say it doesn’t capture our
fancy. Posting MS. back. Try one of the other
papers... .Dosser: Unable to oblige you. But you
might take a deadly revenge by sending the poem
direct to him.... Isaac: One charge from “Islam’s
Holy War” :• —
ALLAH ONE? This Arab shout
THREE? Roman gods he scout
It’s war Between the Gods we find
That’s upmost in this Arab’s mind.
These gods have no eye for pity
They are fighting for the Holy City!
And Mr. Bull to sleep he LULL
While Islam give his leg a, pull.
. ...M.E.: Both knocked out in first round....
Seebee: It fails gracefully. . . .T.8.L.: Unsuitable. . . .
Seeker: Yes, if it’s the right sort of blank verse. This
isn’t.... Waster: Indifferent verse, and we’ve met
the story before. .. .W.A.: How did the good young
man with the nice selection of quotations come to be
alone in the garden with the suburban young person
called .Millie'? Also, why did the young person dress
in “a filmy garb of silvery tissue through which her
beautiful limbs, rounded and smooth as monumental
alabaster, could be plainly discerned?” Where were
Dad and Mum?. . . .Bakstay: Grieved to say the
marine poem had a . list towards the bgsJkef....
L.J.y.: Neither worth while. ... J.L.1.: Unablfe to
use Miefti. .. . A.L. (V.): Both gently declined...y
F.E. (Q.) : The mining verse is the better of the
two ; 'but even that isn’t payable stuff.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CONTRIBUTORS.
Charley H.,: Passed out as being' an outrage upon
the shark.... A. Cameron : Apart from all questions
of drawing, no Weary William or Exhausted Bill
would hold up such a mass of timber.... Douglas:
You don’t know the beginnings of the business. For
one thing, you should make your sketches about 20
times larger, so that they can stand reduction....
W. Dowman: There is considerable merit in the
drawing, but the subject isn’t so mirthful as it
might be. .. .Fred N.: Bather wooden.... Tom M.:
The overfed infant is an old topic. .. .C. 5.8.: Sorry,
but a sketch of a man on a ladder asking a man on
the ground who won the Cup wouldn’t cause the
world to rock with laughter.... Lance M.: You
don’t seem to get much nearer. . . .Kuf: Declined. .. .
0.5. K.: You have possibilities as an artist, though
it isn’t advisable to fill up three-fourths of your
picture with engines and boilers. But the joke
about Macdougall is absolutely unsaleable. This is
the off season for jokes about Macdougall.... N.L.
(Orange): Note your modest remark that you :are
“yery good at sketching.” We’ll take your word
for it, and assume that the samples you send are
somebody else’s.... J.H.L.: More ingenious than in-
teresting. .. . H.G.: Sketch of the man with only one
tooth is rather repulsive. .. .W.H.: The artistic staff
has grown grey-headed trying to decide which is the
worst picture of the three. The oldest artist reckons
they are all as bad as possible. The youngest one
says that each is worse than the other two com-
bined. The thinnest artist considers that there will
never be anything like them again. Norman Lind-
say hasn’t seen them, his medical adviser having for-
bidden excitement; and Vincent telegraphs that he is
glad he was away when they came. Low declines to
give an opinion,- on the -ground that he is a Maori-
lander and doesn’t wish to cause ill-feeling between
the two countries.

For over half a century Alcock’s Billiard Tables have been the
recognised standard of perfection in Billiard Tables. Lindrum,
Gray and other champion players of world-wide repute are quick
to express their appreciation of these excellent tables, for they
realise that, for accuracy, precision, speed and pleasurable play
there is no table in the world to equal them. In fact, it is on the
“ALCOCK” Table that both Lindrum and Gray won their way to
the front.

Melbourne suburbs have been puzzled by a
big machine which is set down at street
corners and carefully watched, though it
does nothing but squat and linger and loaf,
either by day or early night. It is a fathom
high, 18ft. long, and very intricate-looking,
like a compound of printing press, traction
engine and diamond drill. It only works
from midnight to 5 a.m., and its job is plan-
ing the tramway rails smooth where they
begin to show splinters and whiskers. In
fact, it gives old rails a deceptive aspect
of youth—they are thinner, certainly, but
quite serviceable. And it saves the tramway
monopoly quite a mountain of money.

OBJECTS.
The Company is being formed to acquire from the Vendors, on the terms herein set out, the
together with ail the.assets thereof, now being carried on by the Photo Vista Film Syndicate; to carry
on that business and extend same, including the manufacture, sale, purchase, lease and other dealings
with cinematograph negatives, films and apparatus, and also, if thought advisable, to establish in various
parts of Australia moving picture theatres.
No better opportunity than the present is likely to present itself for entering into this business. The
demand for films exceeds the supply. Picture theatres are paying well, and, many of them are returning,
extremely handsome: profits. The whole field of educative cinematography is practically unexplored.
When one remembers the avidity with which either frankly scenic films of foreign cotintries or films,
showing dramatic subjects With a background of foreign countries, are received by picture audiences
here, it is fair to assume that films produced in this country under Similar conditions will receive a
similar reception in other countries. The picture film production business in Victoria is in its absolute
infancy, ana the promoters of the Vendors’ Syndicate felt so-confident that there was a splendid opening
i to establish such a business that they inaugurated a Syndicate and commenced to establish the business.
The Commonwealth of Australia and Dominion of New Zealand are the happv hunting ground of
wealthy tourists. Their unsurpassed beauty spots are unknown even tti xfianv ,o*f our own people. As
subjects of cinematography tney contain scenic treasures . practically untouched. The Promoters are
convinced that, with the development of the production of films of Australian scenes, a new era will be
opened in cinematography, and that just at a time when perfect .on of these scenes can be reached by the
wonders of color cinematography. Pathe Frcres have expressed their willingness not only to act as dis-
tributors for films on usual business terms, but to purchase outrignt films where thev are subjects suitable
for export.
With the pioneering work done the Company will take over the business, which is a going concern.
What has been accomplished can be judged from the following extract from Pattie s Weekly, under date
30th November, 1911: —
“The Photo Vista Company have just produced the first Australian Comedy produced in
“Australia. The story is indescribably funny, and the situations original and unique. The whole
“work is Australian throughout, and is now in the bands of Pathe Freres for inspection. The
“same company have also completed a fine drama, entitled ‘A Miner’s Luck,’ to be released in
“due course. Progress with the new venture has been so satisfactory that arrangements are now'
being made to release at least one drama or comedy, weekly. Mr. Chas. Wheeler (seventeen years
“with Bland Holt) will be the producer, and some fine" stories are being' put in hand.”
The rights of Mr. Ambrose Pratt’s “Outlaws of Weddin Range” have been acquired from that gentle-
man by the Syndicate in consideration of 100 shares and 7 V per cent, royalty.
The Manager of the Syndicate will enter into a long engagement with the Conmany as Manager, and
will undertake to devote his whole time and attention to the business of the Company, and also will make
suitable portion of his property above mentioned, at Beaconsfield, available to the Company for film produc-
tion on a long lease aka merely nominal rental.
Mr. Wheeler will take charge of the stage production; and generally act as Stage Manager.
The Vendors only ask for so much as will purchase the assets in hand at a valuation. For their
work, expenditure and losses in founding the concern, training the staff of artists and assistants, and
obtaining the expert experience they now have, they are prepared to accept shares on the foregoing
conditions.
In accordance with the Companies Act 1910 of Victoria the following information is embodied in
the :

persons as have up to the present signed such Memorandum and the number of shares up to the

BRIGHTEN EXISTENCE.
It is not difficult to know when a mild aperient
is required. One feels dull and depressed; there is
acid in the stomach, oppression at the chest, numb
pain in the back, possibly a sharp attack of indigestion
or biliousness and headache.
Cockle’s Pills quickly dispel all such distressing symptoms of disorder,
cleansing the system thoroughly, restoring tone and stability to the whole
digestive apparatus, purifying the blood, and generally renewing normal
physical conditions as well as mental brightness. In a word, Cockle’s Pills
brighten existence by keeping the body fit and well. The purer skin
and clearer complexion are the sure signs of it.

PRESERVE, YOUR BEAUTY. ~m
The Australian Climate is noted for its deleterious effects upon the complexion ;
freckles, “muddiness,” pimples and fcuier blemishes are likely to their ap-
pearance unless something is done as a deterrent. There is nothing like
ICILMA Fluor Cream,
the “face cream xcithout grease,” for keeping the skin healthy and beautiful. It
is the product of natural mineral waters in Algeria, and is therefore rightly
named “NATURE’S REMEDY.” A little rubbed on the face BEFORE going
out assists, nature to preserve that wonderful velvety condition that is every
woman’s aim and pride. All Chemists, 2/- per pot. Sample tube, 3d. in stamps.

STOMACH TROUBLE
A Carrier’s Suffering from Nausea, Belching, Heartburn,
Headache, etc.—The Penalty of Rough Living.
jkj
ĵk
Mr. James Green, a carrier, of St. George,
via Dailey, Queensland, tells of his suffering
from terrible stomach trouble, and his
cure by the great standard remedy, Bile
Beans, for the benefit of fellow sufferers,
as follows:—“Being a resident of the
bush,” says Mr. Green, “and following
the occupation of a carrier, I have often
been forced to camp under my waggon, and
live on hard fare such as corned beef, soda
bread, etc., and this, combined with the
scarcity of green vegetables, had the effect
of upsetting my stomach. In addition to
this, and to make matters worse, I was
particularly partial to strong tea, and
the inevitable result was bad digestion, which
greatly played up with my health. My sleep
became disturbed, and I was troubled with
nausea, heartburn, wind, belching, occasional
headaches, poor appetite, fulness after
meals, and constipation. Knowing Bile
Beans to be the standard remedy for all these
ailments. I procured a box, and they proved
an efficient remedy—toning up my stomach
and system, cleansing the bowels, and giving
me immediate relief. The wind, nausea, headache, and other nasty synip-
toms from which I suffered, have entirely left me, my freedom from which ij
solely due to Bile Beans. Bile Beans are a handy, useful medicine for those
of my vocation to carry about, as they take up little room, an d are easy to take. ”
WHY BILE BEANS EXCEL
■ ® ile Beans for Biliousness are the product of a modern scientific research, and
therefore thoroughly up-to-date. They do not merely purge, giving temporary relief only
and leaving the patient weakened, like the out-of-date so-called remedies of 40 or 50
years ago. Bile Beans prompt the liver and digestive organs to act in Nature’s normal
way. They produce a gentle action on the bowels, curing or preventing constipation
cleansing the stomach, and ridding the system of all impurities. One Bile Bean U
one dose. They can be discontinued after the cure is effected ; they are purely vegetable •
they do not contain any harmful drugs; and they are the standard family medicine’
Bile Beans are a
PROVED cure for bilious-
ness, headache, indiges-
tion, constipation, piles,
debility, bad blood, bad
breath, loss of appetite,
and all ailments that
owe their origin to
defective liver action.

Live and Let Live.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ihe Live-and-Let-Live Hotel, Forest Creek, Vic.,
has been closed by the Victorian Licenses Reduction
Hoard; compensation £l9s.— News item.
“ T IVE-and-Let-Live!” I knew that
| J Pub;
It was a little shanty built
Where still the Chow takes pan and tub,
To wash for ‘‘colors” in the silt,
For oft I’ve walked for miles to tilt
The cool pint glass upon its bar,
And hear old tales of gold and guilt,
So different from the days that are!
They built it in the Roaring Time,
When every gully yielded gold,
When Forest Creek was in its prime,
Noisy and dissolute and bold ;
When all the diggers, young and old,
Lived as they pleased, nor reckoned then
The Wowser’s nasal voice would scold
The joys and sins of other men.
It was a digger’s motto, that —-
A pleasant creed the world might well
I’aste nowadays within its hat,
And silence thus the Wowser’s yell;
No motto for the folks who smell
And snuffle in another’s yard,
But meant much trouble to dispel:
‘Live-and-let-live” makes life less hard.
Twas there the digger flung his ounce
Upon the bar, and called for wine
Which- —since the truth we can’t renounce —
Was not ambrosial, not divine;
Keats had not found its flavor fine,
For rum and nicotine are rank ;
Who cared? It was an anodyne:
‘Live and let live!” they cried, and drank.
I used to find it lonely, save
> For one old fossicker who sat
Peering (I guess) towards his grave
Beneath an old and battered hat;
And while we smoked and drank and spat,
And offered mutual compliment,
We two, in many a friendly chat,
Learned well what “Live-and-let-live” meant.
For I was young, and he was old;
And I had silver, he had none;
My strength was selling, his was sold ;
My race was starting, his was run ;
/nP es we swa PP e d, and yarns we spun
(There’s some of his unwritten still),
And when at last his time was done,
I paid his undertaker’s bill.
To-day, the Law stalks round, a beast
Biting at all loose ends of life;
It takes the liquor from the feast,
It bids the lover seek a wife.
But in the days of lawless strife
Men had a good old rule that’s gone:
The blackguard dropped his foolish knife:
“Life and let live!”—and things went on.
Live and Let Live! Poor little pub,
With memories we can’t forget,
You die decaying—there’s the rub !
But Wowsers might have spared you yet.
VICTORIA.
M.
Bruisers in Babylon.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BABYLON the Beautiful! City of
Many Waters!
I saw it rise from the baby waves
of its harbor through which our ship slowly
threaded its way, a fragment ripped from
Paradise and cast upon earth to show what
beauty dwells in Elysium. Spire, dome and
mighty piles reared blackly against the rose-
tinted sky ; in the foreground a castle with
the Lion banner floating from its central
tower, and a forest of masts and funnels
scattered along the line where the green
glinting water ended.
This was Babylon, the place to which I
had come to make my fortune, regardless of
whose blood and sweat it should be crystal-
lised from.
All day I wandered round the strange
and to me enchanted city. Along sweltering
streets, through deep arcades where a wilder-
ness of pot plants and ferns dripped water
and made a cool oasis; past gorgeous shop
windows filled with the merchandise of
every country on earth but that to which
they belonged ; in and out of splendid bars
where gaily dressed women served long cool
drinks, and laughed and chatted as though
thev enjoyed it; till in the evening I once
more found myself back in the balconied
house at Potts Point and talking to a
young man in a Tussore suit and Panama
hat. On his still handsome face the mark of
the Beast had not obliterated the grace of
youth. He took a kindly interest in me be-
cause I was a stranger, and led me upstairs
to where his balcony, like an eyrie at the
top of the many-storeyed house, gave a bird’s
eye view of mingled gardens and ship-
covered waters.
In the west a long blue ridge already
turning to purple. It might have been hills
or haze.
“Over there,” he said, as he brought out
whisky and soda with glasses held beneath
his arm, “is the most beautiful river on
earth. And over there, beyond the city,
bush land filled with flannel daisies and
little swamps all aflame with Christmas
bells, that look like tiny lancers riding
through the tall grasses. And there,”
pointing to where the water reflected the
wondrously tinted maize green sky, “is a
sight you can see only in our own city!”
And I believe he was right. If ever there
was an Elysium it was this landlocked har-
bor, its isles and capes silhouetted in the
deepening gloom, and dotted over with glid-
ing ferryboats, their colored lights gleaming
like great clusters of gems against the dark-
ening waters.
“I’d like to take you round, but there’s
a light on to-night, and I’m on the press. If
youd care to have a look at it I shall be
glad to take you! There goes the dinner-
bell.”
He led the way downstairs to a dining-
room in the basement, where the mingled
sounds of the street floated in through wide
open windows, and women sat round a table
bright with flowers and electroplate. They
wore loose wrappers that showed details of
their beautiful bodies in a way that the
heavier stuff garments of my own country
had never done.
“It is the first time I have ever been in a
great city!” I explained, “so please excuse
any gaucheness. I have read of ancient
Rome, of Byzantium, Venice, Paris,. Madrid
and London; but never of anything like
this. It takes me off my feet.”
He smiled faintly.
“I’d give all I possess to have your ex-
perience,” he said softly. “I was born here,
and grew up among it all, and cannot re-
member a time when it filled me with won-
der. I wish I could. It would be great.
Have you ever been to a prize fight?”
“No —but I’ve seen timber-getters fight-
ing. and they are said to be pretty tough.”
“They are —but that was a primitive scrap
with bare knuckles. These fellows you will
look upon to-night are the best friends in
the world, but they fight for the largest
share of a purse, and when they hear the
gong, the savage derision and more savage
glee at the sight of blood, they will become
for the time being wild beasts. They are
heavy-weights, hard hitters, scientifically
trained to inflict and endure punishment.
At first you will be disgusted, and then you
will begin to get interested, and long before
the fight is over you will be whooping as
wildly as the rest, and shouting to the vic-
tor to ‘finish’ the man who is obviously
fighting a losing battle.”
“Sounds like wild beast pleasure.”
“It is, it is,” he agreed, passing some pas-
sion fruit. “And the shocking part of it is
that the more wild beast-like it is the better
we enjoy it. Babylon makes wild beasts of
us all.”
We sat on an electric car that blazed
with light, and roared through streets filled
with men accompanied by women whose
hats were walking gardens, whose breasts
showed voluptuous outlines through the thin
silk that hardly hid the glow of their bodies.
Everywhere the loveliness of woman was
only half-hidden, and they flaunted their
charms in the eye, and were proud of them.
“Pagans everyone!” I murmured.
He nodded. The car came to a standstill
in a street that blazed with bewildering
amethystine globes of light. It was crowded
with men, all hurrying in one direction.
“Where on earth are they all going?” I
asked.
“To the fight, every mother’s son of them
—hurry up or we won’t get a seat.”
He gripped me by the arm and pushed
and drew me in and out among the crowd
till we passed through an iron gate where
men with three days’ growth on their chins
stood by in a row and glowered enviously at
the crowd pouring in to see the battle.
Down a passage, up a staircase, and into
a great circular pit in which tiers of seats
rose from the floor to the roof in the midst
of which a great open space showed the
stars swinging low in a purple ocean.
Clouds of smoke rose from hundreds of
cigars, cigarettes and pipes, and floated
through the open roof. Right in the centre
of the huge building was a roped-off square,
with padded corner-posts. That was the
arena.
The hum of voices was indescribable, and
men were shouting to one another across
the gulf above the arena. Every now and
again in some distant seat men would arise
and call out something quite indistinguish-
able, wave their hands in angry gesticula-
tion, and then subside once more.
I looked round the throng. There were
men in the front seats in evening dress,
there were others in silken suits, and some
who wore silken vests, but the light
Panama hat was everywhere. High up,
sweltering in the hot air near the roof, were
men and boys in their shirtsleeves, all chat-
tering, all smoking.
And the faces! They rise before me yet,
even now when Babylon has grown com-
monplace, and the lovely women attract no
longer, and the love of money has excluded
all other emotions. Those fighting faces!
Great square jaws, firm, strong noses,
shaven jowls, and columnar necks. And
always the half-contemptuous, semi-cynical
expression of the eyes.
A tall, weedy young man rose up and
bawled:—
“Anybody want to lay five to four! Any-
body offering five to four? For heving’s
sike don’t all speak at wanst!”
Nobody took any notice." Just below two
men seemed to be considering and discussing
something. Then both shook their heads, sat
back and looked at one another. One’s hand
stole to his waistcoat pocket, the other
pulled out a pocket-book, and both handed
some money to a third man, who counted it
carefully, and put it in his inside pocket.
Again the weedy young man rose up and
made remarks at the apdience generally.
Another tall form sprang up five rows of
seats away and shouted something to him.
The. weed listened, and then, making an in-
sulting remark, sat down again.
The pressman with me, or, rather, with
whom I was, smiled.
“I’ll lay five to four on the nigger!” he
hissed across the seats to the weed, who
scrambled and pushed till he came along-
side, and they passed their money to me to
hold. Then the weed went back and franti-
cally offered the same odds.
“That fellow knows something, but not
enough. The nigger is hard up, and a syn-
dicate of bookmakers bought him, giving
him a price twice the value of the prize to
lie down and be counted out at the end of
the 19th round; so they are all plunging
wildly on the white man.”
“WeH, if you know this, why did you back
the black man: \ou have laid your money
on the negro.”
“Yes; but Thorley Thornville, the plunger,
has rebought the nigger. Made it worth his
while to win, and the other fellow, never
dreaming of a double shuffle, will be off his ,
guard and get knocked out. That is sport—
in Babylon.”
Up through a trap door climbed the
pugilists, and the house sprang to its feet and
cheered wildly. Both pugs stood in the arena
and waggled their heads delightedly. The
difference was startling. The black man was
over six feet tall, and beautifully built,
everything but his face and head statuesque
• —they were ophidian. The white man was
shorter, squarer built, and stronger far.
Moreover, he had the powerful jaw. clear
eyes and finer head of the dominant race.
The negro was arrayed in trunks only, the
white man wore knickers of white cloth,
and above them his body was brown as ivory,
but a clear, transparent ivory, through which
the blood glowed fitfully.
The fat, podgy man who was to referee

“If the Pain Is There-
in the Small of the Back
Suspect Your Kidneys”
BURDENS LIFTED FROM BAD BACKS.
WEARY is the back that bears the burden of kidney ills. There's no rest or peace for the man or woman who has a bad back. The distress begins
in early morning. You feel lame and not refreshed. It's hard to get out of bed. It hurts to stoop to tie your shoes. All day the ache keeps
up. Any sudden movement sends sharp twinges through the back. It is torture to stoop and straighten. At night the sufferer retires to toss and
twist and groan. Backache is kidney ache —a throbbing dull aching in the kidneys. Plasters or liniments won t do. You must get at the cause, inside.
Mr. R. Spring, Ross Street, Parramatta, says:—“l make
the following statement so that other sufferers may know
that there is an unfailing cure for backache in Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills. Off and on for many years I suffered from
a bad back. I suffered torture ; pains would catch me across
the loins, and I could not get my back straight. I was fre-
quently laid up for days at a time. I consulted doctors, but
their treatment was ineffectual. I used dozens of remedies,
but it was only waste of time and money._ I was advised by a
friend to try Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and sent off for
some. This wonderful remedy cured my aching back. It is
grand to be free of backache, and I am grateful to Doan’s
Backache Kidney- Pills for my cure.”
Five years later Mr. Spring says:—“The above statement
is true every word, and I can now add the important fact that
I am still well to-day. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills deserve
praise ; I will always recommend them.”
Sydney Proof
for
Sydney People,
Mr. Jas. Rees, 16 Upton Street, Sydney, says:—“For over
eight years now I have seen my name appearing in the Sydney
papers in connection with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. The
statement set out that these Pills had cured me of lumbago-like
pains in the small of my back, and it is quite true.
years have now passed since I used Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills, and I have been right ever since. It is no fool of a medi-
cine that will cure like that. I had been having a lot of
trouble with my back before I got this remedy.. I am a painter,
and no doubt my work caused the trouble. Six weeks before I
first used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills I was worse than
usual; my back never stopped paining, and I felt tired out. I
felt that I could not go on suffering like I was, and you will
realise how grateful I am to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
for having cured me ; they cannot be equalled for curing back-
ache.”

the fight leaned languidly over the ropes,
giving instructions in short, decisive sen-
tences, and fragments about “clean break”
and “hitting in holts” were heard intermit-
tently. The gloves of dark brown Were sud-
denly thrown into the ring. The black man

others and walked to the corner. The
grim-faced seconds adjusted them, tied the
strings and suddenly scurried out of the
ring.
A sudden silence seemed to fairly crash
down on the audience. The voice of the
referee requested “gentlemen” to put out all
“smokes,” and then there was a brief pause
of terrific suspense.
A gong sounded—a single tap, as it were.
The fighters arose, advanced to the centre,
shook hands, backed away, and then ap-
proached each other warily. After the roar
and hum the shuffling of their feet sounded
strangely loud in the heavy stillness.
Round they shuffled, each watching for an
opening. Then the white man stepped in
lightly, knocked the black fists away, and
smote the negro in the chest.
The pent-up excitement broke with a roar.
Through it the two men whirled round the
ring, ducking, jabbing, fending. Biff, shuffle,
smack, biff!
The crowd rose en masse. The black man
was down on his knees, his gloved hands
resting on the padded floor.
Torrents of abuse flowed over him. Men
rushed to the ropes and howled to him to
get up and fight, threatening to murder him
if he did not. And above all the roar of
the referee’s voice could be heard : two, four,
five. . . .eight”
And then one last and loudest shout to get
up seemed to suddenly lift the black man to
his feet. The white rushed in and smote
hard. The black took it on the glove, and,
stepping back to avoid the right that swung
out viciously, poised himself for a moment.
His long, black left shot out with a graceful,
lance-like motion, and caught the white
man in the face. White’s blows lost their
aim, he flung up his arms, and, pitching for-
ward, caught the black man round the shoul-
ders and hung on.
I saw his features blurred with blood, over
the red stain his clear blue eyes gleamed
with a murderous light. The black shoved
him off, and he backed away, wiping his eyes
with his glove. The black approached him
warily. The white moved round cautiously.
The black right came out, tentatively, allur-
ingly. The white never heeded it, he was
watching the black man’s eye. And .the
black seemed to creep nearer and nearer with
a stealthy, cat-like movement, feeling his way
with his right fist. His left was drawn
back ready to strike.
The white man ducked in, the left shot
over his shoulder, the whirling white arms
seemed to hurl the brown, gloved fists against
the towering black body, which reeled and
rocked, and then shot over the floor with a
slithering motion, fell heavily against the
ropes, and slipped down to the floor.
“Wan —two —three, foor”
He sprang up, and, instead of backing
away, rushed at his opponent. They met
with a crash, black and white firms were
mixed up together, struggling, hitting, swing-
ing, and then gripped together they rocked
round the ring. Blood streamed from both
faces, showing darkly against the black skin,
luridly against the pink pelt of the white
man. The referee scrambled into the ring,
the audience screeched and howled, and one
excited spectator jumped on to a seat and
hit a tall man in the face, knocking him right
over into the next row of seats. -
Over all the din came the resonant gong,
and referee and seconds tore the combatants
apart and dragged them to their corners,
sprayed water over them, held flasks to their
lips, and fanned them wildly with towels.
The audience subsided like a sullen sea.
Again the gong, and once more they
walked warily round each other. White
tried to rush in, but the long, lance-like left
of black met him full in the face and drove
him back. He tried to duck under —the same
left shot out once more, and then the white
rushed round, feinting, for an opening, tried
to beat down the black guard, and again
stopped the left, which came out always
with the same graceful, piston-like move-
ment.
“He’s beat, he’s beat! Black, black,
black, black !” howled the audience, keeping
time with their feet.
“White, white, white, white! —kill ther
cow !” came the counter roar. Far up, near
the ceiling, a thin, lanky youth was shouting
to white exactly how to do the killing. But
white, with his blue eyes full of blood-lust
and maniacal fury, heard nothing, saw no-
thing, only the ophidian head and its battered
face that he yearned to shatter to pulp, and
could not. He showered his blows like
lightning, aiming every one for the long, black
jaw, that backed and backed away. His
whirling arms met and turned aside the
thrusts of that lance-like left. Blows fell
over his shoulders and chest; he never felt
them, and, struggling closer, struck and
stiuck to kill.
Round and round the roped square they
raged, fighting, fending, the black dancing
away, the white in full pursuit. The audi-
ence felt the strain, the shouting died down,
and a fierce desire for a .sudden ending to
the strenuous, exhausting affair swept
through the crowded hall.
The gong clanged.
The bookmakers were crowding to the
ropes, with scared and anxious faces. This
black brute had either gone mad, and forgot-,
ten the arrangement, or he had sold them.
They shouted unintelligible things to him.
He lay still, with his eyes closed, drinking
in the air from the waving towels. They
swirled round to the corner where the
seconds’ empty chairs made room, and tried
to talk to him. The audience howled and
hooted, and men foaming with fury begged to
their Maker to say had He ever seen any-
thing so barefaced.
“They’re squaring him —they’re squarin’
’im !” they shouted.
For myself I was tired. I had felt every
blow struck. I was sore all over. I felt
that unless it ended soon I should die of
sheer exhaustion.
“Cla-n-n-ng-g!”
They met with a crash. Both reeled back-
wards .and slipped down. Up again and
away round the ring, the black getting home
with two of the piston-like strokes of his
beautiful left, but reeling like a ship in a
gale from a right-handed swing that had
caught him over the heart as he whirled
round. The white man closed in on him,
pinning him to the corner, pressing in close
upon him, boring closer and closer to deliver
the coup de grace.
Again that sudden silence of intense, agon-
ised anxiety. v
The left shot through his guard, and made
impact on his face. He staggered, it shot
out again, he struck feebly, it glided over
his left and smote him on the chin, and down
he went in a heap.
The droning voice of the referee had
reached nine when he struggled up. I sud-
denly felt myself jerked from behind, and
realised that I. too, had risen involuntarily.
I sat down hastily, without taking my eyes
off the pugilists.
The white stood up and met the savage at-
tack of the black with a vicious uppercut
that sent him reeling. They both fell, and lay
still.
The seconds started to scramble through
the ropes, when the combatants struggled to
their feet, and rushed limply at one another.
There was a roar of excitement from the
audience, the men swayed about, and over
the noise came the shrill shriek of the negro
in agony, and with a desperate effort he
shook the white man off, fell down on his
hands and knees, and struggled towards the
referee. After him scrambled the dazed
white, hitting at him as he crawled, with
helpless, powerless blows.
The audience was on its feet roaring in-
anely, the bookmakers were rushing wildly
towards the referee, who was in the ring,
with his hand on the negro’s head, howling
something quite unintelligible. The white’s
seconds dragged him away, and disap-
peared down the trap door. The crowd
started to surge for the doors, we were
swept along, when the weed suddenly ap-
peared and demanded his money back.
“Let’s get the referee’s decision!” said the
pressman, struggling against the torrent help-
lessly. The flood of men and youths swept
us apart, and, after what seemed a frightful
interval, I found myself in the courtyard,
with the Weed holding my sleeve. A man
was posting up a notice: —
“BLACK WON ON A FOUL!”
Then the pressman caught me by the arm
' from somewhere and steered me through the
torrent into a side stream through glass
doors, and brought me to anchor at a bar.
“What made black screech so?” I in-
quired, sinking down into the cushioned
lounge.
“White bit him!” smiled the pressman,
tilting the nether end of his glass heaven-
wards, and taking an observation at the
roof through the base of it.
We wandered homeward through a park of
century-old trees, and breathed in the per-
fume-laden puffs of faint, warm wind. _ Lo-
custs and other cicadw made sweet music in
the trees. Past great, silent ships lying at
iron-gated wharves, up steep steps to the
house, and on to the balcony from which the
jewelled ferry boats could be seen wander-
ing on the invisible water.
And so ended my first day among the wild
beasts of Babylon.
C. A. JEFFRIES.
The Winner.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SHEEMSH’ me,” began the man in the
middle, didactically.
The tall, lean, brown person on his
right reached across and made a dive among
the water-biscuits. He seized three, and con-
veyed them to his mouth in a bunch.
“Too mush weigh’, Shmish !” he urged in a
muffled roar, from among the biscuits.
“Sheemsh’ me” —insisted the first speaker.
“Well, well, well, Joe, if y’arsh me,” said
the rest of the party, a man in a green-rib-
boned strawdecker, with socks to match, low-
cut shoes and a clean-shaven, red jaw, show-
ing the fatness of some 40 summers.
“Sheemsh’ me,” came from beneath the
drooping moustache of the persistent Smith.
Joe exhaled a shower of crumbled biscuit,
and broke in hastily. “Dish’ance too far.
Shmish! Too mush weigh’! Far too mush
weigh’!”
Smith took his empty glass and rapped
angrily upon the bar. The drink merchant
came along.
“Whisky an’ slio’!” said Joe.
“Whi’!” murmured the green-socked one,
lazily, leaning against the polished railing.
The booze stevedore supplied them, and
waited for Smith’s order. Smith rapped
hard again with his empty glass, staring into
vacancy, and the man of beer reached for the
local bulk and poured him out two fingers.
“Sheemsh* me,” Smith went on, with an
air of renewed confidence.
“Nusli—nush —nushin’ o’ th’ hind!' burst
out the 40-year-old, bitterly. “Nush—nush
—nush,” and lost the thread of his discourse,
while Joe broke in with a final word.
“Rot! Rot!—all rosh!” he declared.
“ ’Orsh ain’t gorranope !” .
There was a short silence, during which
drinking took place. Smith was ready first.
“Sheemsh’ me,” he commenced again, hope-
“Worrall you ’ave, Smiss?” asked Green.
Smith raised his glass for the third time,
annoyed, and once more banged it heavily on
the beer-proof bar-covering.
“Sheemsh’ me,” he shouted passionately,
and Green leaned over and touched the bar-
man on the shoulder.
“Give’m dhink!” lie begged, earnestly.
“Pore shevil wance it!” . .
Again the gentle noise of lapped spirits,
and three comfortable sighs; and presently
the trio made for the door, the long, brown
Joe with an arm about each of his pals
shoulders. .
At the exit they jammed, filtering through
by degrees. Smith fell out last, and from
the street there came a strangled sound, as
of a stout man groping for his hat after talc-
ing, ten drinks.
“Sheemsh’ me.” But the rattle of a pass-
ing cab.obliterated the rest of the sentence,
if there was any, and the barman moaned
slightly to himself, and gloomily swallowed
a pony of dry ginger ale. His troubles about
the winner—on 35 bob a week !

1 — It uses cheap lamp oil (such as kerosene), and other residuals.
2 The oil .is injected directly into the cylinder, thus dispensing with unre-
liable and inefficient vaporisers.
3 It is very simple in construction, there being no electric ignition or other
complicated mechanism.
4 Its speeds are such that electric generators and centrifugal pumps may

WHY Every Farmer should
use ELECTRIC LIGHTS.
ELECTRIC LIGHT is the only modern method of illumination for all purposes. Electric
lighting is specially adapted for use in farm-houses, stables, barns, where there is danger of
tires if coal, oil, acetylene or gas lamps are used.
If you live in the country, you know without our telling how much you need Electric Lights.
You already know how handy, clean and convenient electric lamps are, and vou would, perhaps,
have installed them years ago if it had not been for the high cost of the old style, or for running
the wires out from the
nearest town.
You know how poor
oil lamps are, and how
you have to strain your
eyes trying to read,, while
you inhale the kerosene
smoky atmosphere, and
the trouble to keep your
lamps clean. Your doc-
tor knows how unhealthy
your lamps are; your
decorator how it pays
him.
Electric Lights are
Absolutely Safe —No
Danger of Fire.
In almost every news-
paper you pick up, you
read of an explosion of
an acetylene gas plant or
a kerosene lamp falling
over or setting the
place on fire, often with
fatal results.
.
ELEC TRIO LIGHTS ARE HANDY. Turn on the switch and thege you have it. No hunting
for matches in the dark; no lights blowing out. You can have lights on the wall, ceiling, floor,
table, piano, stable, gate, bed-side; Electric Fans to keep you cool; Radiators to make vou warm;
Electric Burglar Alarms ; Bells. THE PRICES ARE IN REACH OF ALL.
FARMERS ARE ENTITLED TO THE CONVENIENCES OF THE CITY
Because of the wonderful state of development of the
WATSON ELECTRIC LIGHTING System
including the storage battery, dynamo, engine, lamps and switchboard, together with the low cost
of installation. We provide a storage battery, so that the electricity can be made whenever
convenient and kept ready for use. You, or one of your men, can attend to the engine while doing
other work One charge will give you enough current to run your lights practically a week.
WIIAT IT COST TO RUN A WATSON OUTFIT. —The care and Operation of Watson Farm-
house Lighting Outfit are so simple that anyone can readily learn. They are very inexpensive
to install. Ihe cost of operation is very low, both in fuel and attendance.
“We estimate that, you can light TEN 16-CANDLE POWER LIGHTS for ONE HOUR at a
cost of Id.
