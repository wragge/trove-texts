National Notebook
Gala
The gala performance in Sydney last
week to celebrate the 10th birthday
of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre
Trust made two things clear there is
a great deal of talent in this country and
no proper use is being made of it. And
that, of course, is where the Trust came
ia.
It’s a great life
After an unhurried breakfast of half
a grapefruit, one lightly boiled egg
and a slice of toast spread with orange
marmalade, Captain R. J. Robertson,
formerly of HMAS Melbourne, drank
several cups of strong black coffee. He
then prepared for the fray, bundling
together a pile of roneoed copies of his
first official Press statement since his
resignation from the Navy. Outside, the
wind ripped across the Robertson
family’s disused lawn tennis court at a
rate of knots, blowing the hair of wait-
ing TV interviewers askew. There were,
shortly before nine a.m., 41 Sydney
reporters, radio and TV men, camera-
men and technicians waiting on the
tennis court. A cluster of mikes had
been set up near where the net used to
be. Handkerchiefs had been wrapped
around them to deaden the noise level
of the wind.
The ensuing barrage of questions left
Captain Robertson unflurried. Some he
answered at length. Others only briefly.
A few not at all. One he ignored was:
“Say, Captain, do you go along with
the idea that Spicer was like a boy sent
on a man’s job?” In another form a
similar question did evince this reply
from him, however: “I feel it was very
difficult for a non-seafaring judge to
get a clear mental picture of what hap-
pened the night Voyager went down.
To some extent Mr Justice Spicer suc-
ceeded, to some extent he didn’t.”
In time the questions began to repeat
themselves. And to each repeated ques-
tion (several, such as “Is your conscience
completely clear?” were asked at least
five times) Captain Robertson gave pre-
cisely the same answer.
One of the last questions was about
his son, Brian, who wants to join the
Navy. Would he still encourage him?
Why not?” said the captain, with barely
a _ glance at the microphone held under
his nose, “It’s a great life.”
C o m niercialism
Half-Dollar silver piece stamped
with the profile of President Ken-
nedy has been given us as a memento by
a visiting American couple. The coins
were struck as a memorial to the assas-
sinated President. Because Americans
snapped them up by the suftcase-full at
banks, supplies are now exhausted, our
New York friends say. Already the half-
dollars have become collectors’ items
and are fetching up to 20 times their
face value on private markets. We
understand that the U.S. Treasury, con-
cerned about such commercialism, plans
to devalue the Kennedy coins to their
original 50 cents by minting several
million more next year, also dated 1964.
Fighting Fish
/'An Ron Kingsbury’s 48ft. charter-
cruiser Bataan in Sydney last week
we talked game-fishing. “You wouldn’t
believe it,” Kingsbury said, “but this
boat is the only licensed game-fisherman
on a thousand miles of coastline. Took
at New Zealand. Big business over there,
charter-boats by the score. I would say
we can turn on the fish equal to them,
if not better. Our weather is finer. We
have no navigational problems. Only a
week or so ago one boat, the Jack 111,
caught 34 tuna, with an aggregate weight
of 1300 lbs. One boat!”
That there are game-fish of world
standards in our coastal waters, in our
near Sydney waters, is abundantly clear.
That these sporting resources have never
been exploited internationally is also
clear. Yellow-fin tuna, blue-fin tuna,
striped and mackerel tuna, dolphin-fish
(no relation to the dolphin), wahoo shark,
and the king of fighting-fish, the marlin.
“Fish,” Kingsbury said, waving an
arm toward a hair-line horizon, “we
haven’t seriously fished off the Continen-
tal Shelf, only 17 miles out. The real big
ones are out wide. We haven’t fished our
Equatorial current, as, for instance, the
Gulf Stream is fished. It's experience
that counts. An example is bait. We’re
just getting the know-how now. You
don’t get a monster using a -!!b yellow-
tail. Maybe we could try a large king-
fish, or striped tuna, alive, about 61bs.
I would say, one day, our own east
coast will prove itself a mecca equal
to New Zealand, Florida, Hawaii, equal
if not better . . .”
American tourists, and they figure
prominently in Kingsbury’s charter
work, say that fishing in our waters is
the best in the world. Among the fight-
ing fish, we lack only the tarpon and the
bonefish —but we can add to the list our
old Australian friend, the shark.
Generally despised elsewhere as a “bag
of guts”, we have the largest and fight-
ingest, a dubious honor in this land of
surfers. As everyone knows, the best
period for shark is January—not because
there are many more of them but be-
cause, for a week or more, they mate
without eating. At the end of it, they
are exhausted, vicious and hungry. The
bronze and white whalers lay their young
alive in the upper reaches of the harbor,
and experts suggest that the female is
usually the killer.
The mako shark ranks with the marlin
as a game-fish and as an eating fish, the
latter a little-known fact. But of all
the fish that fill the sea, none so brave,
none so spectacular, as the tail-walking,
80-mph black marlin. Or blue marlin.
Or striped or dogbrain. This finicky,
frustrating, toothless denizen has been
seen to lift its own weight in impaled
shark straight out of the water. It will
ram a boat, or play for half an hour
with a bait, tossing it 20 feet or more
with a sideways motion of its bill.
Totally unpredictable, a gorged marlin
can actually be teased into taking the
bait. But it likes to strike running
downwind before a southerly breeze.
The fighting fury of the marlin on
the end of a line is an incomparable
thrill, an arched iridescence of muscle
leaping out to the sun, so fast he defies
gravity at one side of the boat while the
line is straight out on the other side;
thus many a crew has been duped into
thinking there are two fish. Yet the odds
are not against him. Many get away.
Especially the big ones.
And yet, at Port Stephens recently,
100-odd marlin were caught in a week
of competition something of a world
record.

other industries, we’ve been suffering
from labor shortages. I noted how many
jobs advertised carry an age limit of 44
0 r younger. There are plenty of jobs in
our factory that an older man can handle.
After our second advertisement it was
like the depression days. We received
an avalanche of applications and hired
almost 100 people. Of course, a few
found they weren’t quite as young as they
thought and dropped out. But very few
I think our net gain won’t be short of
90.”
Precious
We’re still not entirely convinced that
“get out there and sell” means the
same thing to the British as it does to
the rest of us. At the British Exhibition
at Sydney’s Showground, a woman we
know admired a ring among the jewel-
lery on show and asked if she could buy
it. “Well,” said the designer reluctantly,
“you can't actually have that one. But
if I met you a few times and got to know
your personality, tastes and so on I
could design one for you.”
After that, we went to the less rare-
fied atmosphere of a £300,000 exhibi-
tion of jewellery at Proud’s and talked
to their gem expert, Mr D. Jack. Things
are apparently booming in the jewellery
business. Mr Jack told us his turnover
on precious stones was up more than
£50,000 on last year. He smiled as we
respectfully handled a couple of solitaire
rings worth between £7OOO and £lO,OOO.
Did we have many valuable collections
in this country? Not so many, but one
Victorian woman has a collection valued
at £230.000 and three or four families
bought regularly, building up comparable
collections.
Mr Jack has what is probably a decep-
tively casual approach to all this wealth.
His desk in a cramped office is piled
high with boxes, trays, loops of pearls,
and envelopes tagged with their valuable
contents. A multi-drawer unit on his
left carries trays of gems, tins and cigar
boxes and hundreds of envelopes. He
Values his surrounding wealth in the
region of £1 million.
“Australian gems are very valuable,”
he told us, “of course our pearls are
particularly known. Our opals are re-
nowned, and we do produce diamonds
that are the hardest in the world. The
diamond mines of the world are expected
to end production around the end of the
century so diamond prices are bound to
go up.”
about the more modest gem
lover? “Cultured pearls are cheap
enough and there has been a terrific in-
crease in demand for them. You can buy
a single stone diamond from about £25.
In fact several gems begin around the
ten guinea mark. About 80 per cent of
the good jewellery sold in Australia is
made here and our prices compare with
those of Europe. I think our craftsmen
are equal to any.”
Was there still prejudice against Aus-
tralian opals on superstitious grounds?
Mr Jack smiled, “The Americans ended
all that. They began buying opals during
the war and really opened up the mar-
ket.” He reached out and took down a
cigar tin and opened the lid. We gazed
at the variety of colors and shades from
black to light iridescent. He handed
us a huge opal composed of minute
lozenges of sparkling color.
“That is a rare harlequin opal—worth
about £lO,OOO. That lot you’re looking
at is priceless. It’s a collection built
up over several years. No, I don’t
think many people still consider opals
unlucky.”
Voice of the Muse
'T'he English actor Harold Lang talked
to us the other afternoon about his
new production, “Man Speaking”, which
has its world premiere in Sydney this
week. This three-man show, successor to
his dramatised lecture on Shakespearean
action, “Macbeth in Camera”, is what
Lang calls “a conversation piece with
a Shavian flavor” about the reading and
understanding of poetry; but it is not, he
hastens to explain, a conventional poetry
reading. “Fve never found a poetry
recital yet that didn’t make me feel
deeply soporific,” he told us flatly. “I’m
always surprised by the attitude of eleva-
tion and respect people have about
literature,” he went on, “and by their
passionate opinions on how poetry
should be spoken—as if by royal zombies
with mouths full of plums ki gauze.”
“Man Speaking,” he told us, takes
poems by Donne, Milton, Blake and
others, and puts forward the thesis that
all poetry is essentially dramatic. “In
every poem there is a persona, however
dim,” he said, “and there is always a
situation. You have to guessingly re-
construct it for yourself.”
Lang, who is an exuberant talker,
advocates hard work in the theatre.
Before every performance his youthful
company has a warm-up rehearsal of
two and a half hours. “Most actors are
just about ready to begin when they’ve
finished the performance,” he said dis-
gustedly. He told us that in preparation
for his work on the script of the new
production he had read a great deal of
poetry aloud. “I could split an anapaest
at a hundred paces,” he said.
“Man Speaking” will have four per-
formances in Sydney, and then goes on
tour to country centres on behalf of the
Arts Council and the British Council.
It will be seen later in Canberra and
Brisbane.
CIVILISING "NIGGERS”
ffij^ulLetCn
80 Years Ago: October 11, 1884
7TYie other day there came before the
House of Commons a paper re-
ferring in an incidental kind of way
to the complaints made in reference
to the treatment of Aborigines at
Rottnest Prison, Western Australia.
It seems from the British Parlia-
mentary reports that this trifling affair
has been cleared up to the complete
satisfaction of the colonial officials.
One would think that Rottnest Prison
had not for years passed been a hell
upon earth that the wretched
Aborigines entombed therein had not
been dying all the time like fluky
sheep that they had not rotted in
chains of fever generated by filth and
over crowding and bad food. And
for what offences? Killing a sheep or
a bullock on land of which they had
been deprived by the whites, or trying
to kill a white man who outraged
their women. Let no one imagine for
an instant that in Western Australia
a blackfellow who had killed a white,
under whatever provocation, was ever
allowed to go unhung, if he could be
caught. How often have we read in
the S.M. HERALD a telegram some-
thing like this: “The Sheriff and his
assistants today proceeded to prepare
for the execution of Jackey and
Tommy, who are to be hanged on the
20th instant for murdering a stock-
man in the employ of Mr Brown, JP,
of Jone’s Plains station”? If the
blacks of Western Australia are
human beings and have souls, then
those who are responsible for the
treatment they have received are
murderers as base and brutal as any
who ever were throttled by the hang-
man. The history of the Biack-hole of
Calcutta, in which a few whites were
smothered by a blood-thirsty and
tryannical Indian despot, is written in
letters of blood, and known to every
schoolboy. But what English school-
boy knows of the hideous cruelties
which in the name of law and of
justice have in modern days been
wreaked on the unhappy natives of
Western Australia and Queensland?
We don’t say anything about those of
NSW and Victoria. They have gone
down to the pit.

" Look at it objectively Oswald kills Kennedy, Ruby kills Oswald. Right cancels out left - it's an obvious
plot by Governor Scranton and the moderates."


PLAIN ENGLISH
What Happened in Dallas
T h e Warren Report on the assassina-
tion of President Kennedy was
not expected to satisfy the various
conspiracy theorists in Europe, Ame-
rica or Australia who, long before it
wa s published, “knew” it was going
to be a “whitewash job”. The Euro-
peans, for example the same ones
who refused to believe that there were
Russian missiles on Cuba until Mr
Khrushchev said he would take them
ou t —can be expected to believe any-
thing about America, even that the
Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court,
is involved in a conspiracy, whatever
it may be. For them, the fact that all
Americans of Russian or East-Euro-
pean birth were not arrested in the
European style immediately it became
known that Lee Harvey Oswald had
been in Russia only went to prove
that the plotters of Mr Kennedy’s
death were hand-in-glove with the
FBI. No amount of evidence or
“naivety” about democratic practices
can change their minds.
But it is the Americans and their
Australian disciples of the conspiracy
persuasion who are the most vocife-
rous. There are two schools. The
slightly more plausible is that Mr
Kennedy was killed in a Communist
plot plausible because Oswald was
a Communist who had lived in
Russia and because Communists have
long been active internationally as
assassins, including Leon Trotsky
among their North American victims.
Yet plausible or not, there is no evi-
dence for it and no evidence that the
Communists stood to gain by murder-
ing Mr Kennedy.
The hard core of the conspiracy
theorists, however, is those who
“know” it was a Right-wing plot.
There is a curious history of this
theory. As soon as the news of the
assassination was announced, its ad-
herents immediately decided that
Right-wing fanatics had done it. Only
Right-wingers do this sort of thing, of
course, and Communists are merely
misguided idealists. When it became
known that Oswald was a Communist,
there was stunned silence. But this
only lasted about a month. Soon the
H^ or^sts b e gan to detect “important”
differences between the way the news
w . as fr e i n g reported in different parts
. America. In this they saw deep
significance. Then the Texas police
and the FBI contradicted each other
on various minor points, adding fuel
to their suspicions. By piecing the
bits together they gradually saw the
truth in all its clarity: that it was a
Right-wing plot all along, with a
pseudo-Communist doing the job to
confuse the issue, and the assassin
being killed to silence him. After all,
the whole thing happened in Dallas.
Finally Mark Lane, a prominent
American criminal lawyer, prepared
a brief emphasising every clumsy detail
in the official handling of the case, the
contradictions of officials, the irrele-
vant but horrible death including
suicide of minor figures associated with
the inquiries in Dallas, and a case of
some legal plausibility, as well as a
good story, was built up. If only a
minority in America would listen to
him, he was sure of a good hearing
overseas.
One of the strengths of the Warren
Report is that it closely examined
every conspiracy theory. It estab-
lished, as far as it is humanly pos-
sible, the tame conclusion that things
happened as they seemed to have hap-
pened—that an unbalanced Commu-
nist, acting alone, assassinated the
President and that another unbalanced
man killed the assassin.
It must be added, however, that if
some groups do not accept the Report,
the Warren Commission is at least
partly to blame since it met for months
on end in camera. It was these months
of silence that left the conspiracy-
minded free to develop whatever
theory most appealed to them. The
Australian passion for public Royal
Commissions may lead to abuses, but
it is clearly better to run that risk
than to conduct public affairs in
private.
The Passing, of the
Wheeler-Dea levs
years ago this week, on Labor
Day, Dr H. V. Evatt delivered his
historic speech attacking the Right-
wing of the Labor Party and the in-
fluence of Mr B. A. Santamaria. In
the months and years that followed
the once great ALP was reduced to a
subject for light relief, when its flirta-
tion with Communists did not make
it dangerous. Ten years later it shows
few signs of reform. As Alan Reid
points out in his account of the Split
(see story, page 14), the great issue
has simply changed from how to
fight Communists in the Labor move-
ment to whether they should be fought
at all.
One of the most striking themes in
Reid’s story is the utter ineffectual-
ness of the ALP Right-wing once it
expelled those who formed or sup-
ported the Democratic Labor Party.
The Split was only made possible be-
cause the wheeler-dealer Right-wing,
scenting victory, supported the Leftists
and pro-Communists against the fol-
lowers of Mr Santamaria, and it is
only ironic that they have been power-
less against the Left-wing ever since.
Today the bankruptcy of the Right-
wing in NSW—the last stronghold of
the wheeler-dealers—is shown in its
moves to collaborate with the leftist
Victorian ALP under an arrangement
whereby it will not attack Victorian
ALP deals with Communists if the
Victorians do not rock the NSW boat
and refrain from embarrassing the
Renshaw Government. This simply
leaves the initiative with the Victorians
and one may safely predict that in due
course the rising Left-wing in NSW
(which is so active in the forthcoming
“Peace” Congress) will take over. As
Reid puts it: “Nobody ever won a war
by defending a fortress while ceding
away an empire.”
After ten years, Labor remains
dominated by a Left-wing which
knows what it wants, while the
wheeler-dealer Right-wing tags along
in the hope of preserving its privileges.
The Labor Split is not yet over, but
in the final show-down between the
new Left and the old Right the
wheeler-dealers will almost certainly
lose. For the public, this may mean
that the Labor Party will be finished
forever; as for the Right-wing, they
have had it coming.


THIS AUSTRALIA
LABOR DAY
My Role in the Labor Split
The 10th anniversary of Dr Trait's “King Hit"
By ALAN REID
October marks another anniversary
of the beginnings of the Great
ALP Schism, the consequences of
which a decade later still bedevil and
weaken the Australian Labor Party.
It was October 6, 1954, when the then
Federal Labor Leader, Dr Herbert Vere
Evatt, seemingly discredited and on the
verge of discard but indomitably re-
sourceful, fired the first formal shot in
the bitter, merciless ALP war that he
was to win brilliantly but never com-
pletely. For the Prime Ministership he
coveted eluded his grasp, and even be-
fore his voluntary departure from the
political scene in 1960 there were signs
that forces other than those he originally
headed in 1954 would fall heir, or had
fallen heir, to the main fruits of his
victory within the strife-ravaged and
electorally-enfeebled ALP.
S. Keon
B. A. Santamaria
As I see it, there is a lot of mistaken
thinking about what is happening in the
ALP today. It is accepted uncritically
that the current guerrilla-type warfare
between Rightists and Leftists is merely
a continuation, in an underground and
irregular form, of the once official hos-
tilities between the Groupers and the
anti-Groupers. But an examination of
the changes that have taken place be-
tween 1954 and 1964 suggests that this
easy interpretation is untenable. The
present struggle is not the same as the
past struggle but a consequence of it.
The issues are significantly different and
the opposed groups are not the same in
composition and origin as those ranged
against each other in 1954.
In 1954 as now there were all kinds
of personal cross-currents and involved
alliances arising from personal jealousies,
ambitions, loyalties and hates. But when
you got down right to the bone, there
were two basic issues in 1954.
Issue (1) was whether a force outside
the ALP and alien to its philosophy (the
force that later hived off from the ALP
to form the Democratic Labor Party)
should, through the control it was estab-
lishing over the Australian trade union
movement, enforce upon the ALP its
policies, aims and directives.
Issue (2) was how Communism should
be fought in the Australian trade union
movement.
In 1964, if you again get down right
to the bone, there are once more two
basic issues. These 1964 issues have a
superficial resemblance to those of 1954.
But the resemblance is purely super-
ficial. There are differences funda-
mental differences.
In 1964 Issue (1) is again whether a
force outside the ALP and alien to its
philosophy should, through the control
it is establishing over the Australian
trade union movement, enforce upon the
ALP its policies, aims and directives.
But this time it is the Communist Party,
and not the force that created the DLP,
that is threatening a takeover of the ALP
by extending its influence and control
over the Australian trade union move-
ment. The modus operandi is the same;
only the purposes of the operation are
different.
In 1964 Issue (2) is not how Com-
munism should be fought in the Aus-
tralian trade union movement (that was
the 1954 issue) but whether Communism
should be fought in the Australian trade
union movement.
Dr Evatt himself drew attention to
how the nature of the struggle within the
ALP was changing shortly before his re-
tirement from politics. Dr Evatt was
talking about Unity tickets. Evatt,
who, whatever may have been his faults,
had historical perception, told an ALP
Federal Executive meeting “Unity tickets
are a running sore which may one day
destroy the Labor Party.”
It is not without significance that the
forces within the ALP that insisted the
party must not intervene in any way in
trade union affairs, and thereby allowed
the Communist Party to extend un-
challenged its area of control over this
Dr H. V. Evatt
key field of activity, lost much of their
enthusiasm for Dr Evatt as Federal
Labor Leader when he made this state-
ment. They exhibited no discernible
regret when, not long afterwards, be
departed from politics.
It is also not without significance that
many of those who fought under Dr
Evatt’s banner in 1954 on the issue of
how Communism should be fought in
the trade union movement Deputy
Opposition Leader Gough Whitlam.
Labor Senate Leader Nick McKenna
Deputy Senate Labor Leader P. J. Ken
nelly, NSW ALP President Mr C. T,
Oliver, Senator Jimmy Ormonde (NSW),
and even to some degree individuals like
the Victorian President, Mr R. Holt, and
a host of others are now the targets
of those who, by their insistence that
the ALP should not in any circumstances
intervene in the trade union movement
have created the 1964 issue of whether
Communism should be fought in the
trade union movement.
To understand what is happening is
the ALP today, you have to recall what
was the position—broadly—in the ALP
in the months leading up to October.
1954.
Dr Evatt at that period was under
heavy threat. It looked as though he was
on the way out. His position as Federal
Labor Leader had been undermined by
(1) electoral defeat in May, 1954,
(2) happenings at the Petrov Royal Co®’
mission, and (3) the hostility of a section
of his followers, both in the Federal
Parliament and the ALP, engendered h)
his successful opposition to the referen-
dum proposal submitted by the Menzies
Government asking for constitutional
authority for the Commonwealth to ban
the Communist Party.
Undoubtedly working for Dr Evatt 5


replacement as Federal Labor Leader
was Mr Bartholomew Augustine Santa-
niaria. Mr Santamaria today is a
national figure whose creation, the DLP,
which he improvised out of the ALP
split, has become a national force strong
enough to keep Labor out of Federal
power on those occasions since 1954
when the Menzies Government has ex-
perienced a period of electoral unpopu-
larity. But in 1954 (and this was to be
a major factor in determining the out-
come of ALP struggle) Mr Santamaria
w'as unknown to the public and to the
vast majority of ALP members and
operated outside the public spotlight.
Though there were all kinds of per-
sonal cross-currents and shadings in
ideological loyalties, the forces then
operating in and on the ALP were
broadly:
• The Santamarians, who, operating
from a mainly Roman Catholic base
organised by Mr Santamaria, were
dedicatedly anti-Communist.
• The Right-wing ALP traditionalists,
who were also anti-Communist.
• The ALP Left-wing which accepted
the proposition that Communism was not
an authoritarian philosophy but a work-
ing class movement with which the ALP
as a Party, and ALP members as indi-
viduals, could co-operate to mutual
advantage.
Of the three groups, the Santamarians,
though numerically much smaller than
the Right-wing ALP traditionalists, un-
doubtedly formed the most influential
J. Chamberlain, C. Oliver,

2nd aggressive element within the ALP.
Realising that whoever controlled the
Australian trade union movement must,
because of the structure of the ALP, end
U P in control of the ALP, they had set
°ut to win control of the trade union
Movement, or at least a sufficiently large
sector of it to assure them the domi-
MMt say in both union and ALP affairs.
te n using ALP “front” men rather
, lan identifiable adherents (a tactic of
o Communists) they were phenome-
nal|y successful.
wj The second group —the ALP Right-
-8 traditionalists—was numerically
One of Alan Reid's first stories about the split — October 17, 1954.
the largest. This group was anti-Com-
munist and to that extent was prepared
to accept at face value the proposition
that the Santamarians were just another
ALP group whose anti-Communism
manifested itself in an unusually fervent
form. Not until the Santamarians
widened their ambitions and started
to insist not only that Communists
should be opposed in union ballots
but that, even in ALP unions, the ALP
officials in charge should be a special
type of anti-Communist approved by the
Santamarians, did hostility to “outside”
control over the ALP start to develop
on any significant scale. It was this
hostility that Dr Evatt was to exploit to
preserve his leadership and to defeat
the Santamarians within the Party.
The third ALP group of 1954—the
Left-wingers—had no problem when the
showdown came. They had nothing to
lose but the shackles imposed on them
by the Santamarians and everything to
gain. Their freedom of operation within
the Party had been contracting for years.
Against the combination of the Santa-
marians and the Right-wingers, they were
impotent. The ALP had an official
organisation—the ALP Industrial Groups
—operating in the trade union move-
ment. But the Santamarians had made
the mistake of keeping this organisation
for all practical purposes under their con-
trol. The Left-wingers reasoned that if
the Santamarians were discredited, the
Industrial Groups could be discredited.
If they played their cards shrewdly, they
could secure the elimination of the In-
dustrial Groups. Elimination of the
Industrial Groups would leave a power
vacuum in the trade union movement.
The Left-wingers or people to whom
they had no violent antagonism, such as
the Communists—could fill that vacuum.
And once they asserted their power in
the trade union movement they could
(just as the Santamarians had done before
them) increasingly assert their power and
their viewpoint in the ALP machine and
the ALP’s policy-making bodies. Under-
standably and intelligently, they threw in
wholeheartedly with the Right-wing ele-
ments Dr Evatt had mustered against
the Santamarians.
Their acceptance of the role of minor
auxiliaries to the Right-wing was justi-
fied by the outcome of the events that
followed. They are now in 1964 suffi-
ciently strong to contemplate with
equanimity a head-on clash with the anti-
Communist Right-wing ALP traditional-
ists to whom they were subordinate allies
in 1954.
Some anti-Santamarian Right-wing
ALP personalities were as perceptive as
the Left-wingers. They appreciated what
would happen within the trade union
movement (and in the long term within
the ALP) if the ALP abandoned all acti-
vities in the industrial arena. They knew
that the ALP would be handing the
fruits of victory over the Santamarians
to the Communist Party. They wanted
to maintain the Industrial Groups, or
some similar organisation, purged of
Santamarian elements to combat Com-
munism in the trade union movement.
The consequences of ALP withdrawal
from the industrial arena would be, they
warned, to place the Communist Party
in the situation that the Santamarians had
occupied. As the only organised group
operating in the trade union movement,
it must end up in a position of immense
power.
But by that time the Right-wing forces
which rallied to Dr Evatt had no interest
in possible consequences of victory over
the Santamarian forces. Rather like the
allies in World War 11, they were inter-
ested in only one thing—victory—and


blind to the possible aftermath. Passions
were running deeply. Superimposed on
the original issues was sectarianism in
a violent form, a sectarianism that was
the product of resentment against the fact
that it was a mainly Roman Catholic
philosophy that Mr Santamaria had
sought to impose upon the ALP and
that in pursuit of his aims Mr Santamaria
mainly used Roman Catholic lieutenants,
as though he had reservations about the
loyalty to the anti-Communist cause of
even tested anti-Communists of other
religious affiliations.
T abor legend credits me with having
brought to a head the issues that
split the Party in 1954 and with creating,
through my writings, the political cli-
mate that enabled Dr Evatt to defeat
the Santamarians who, prior to the public
spotlight being directed on Mr Santa-
maria, seemed impregnably entrenched
in the ALP and certain to defeat Dr
Evatt.
This may be so. I don’t know. I do
know that Dr Evatt used my writings
over this period to mount the type of
campaign that ultimately brought him
victory in the Party but not in the elec-
torate. For example, he fired his first
official shots in the war against the
Santamarians on October 6, 1954, the
day after I produced in an article
headed “Paradox of the Industrial
Groups” which, so far as I know, was
the first account in any detail to appear
in any Australian daily of Mr Santa-
maria’s activities both in the trade union
movement and the ALP. He linked Mr
Santamaria with “The Movement” and
individuals within the ALP continually
after I produced an article on October
17, 1954. in which Mr Santamaria’s
operations and mode of operation were
given in even greater detail. On various
other occasions, Dr Evatt also used
articles I wrote as the basis for his theme
that the ALP was in grave danger of
being taken over by an “outside”, largely
Roman Catholic, force which was opera-
ting in secrecy and hidden from public
scrutiny.
But Labor legend to the contrary
there was no collaboration between Dr
Evatt and myself. It was merely Dr
Evatt, improvising superbly and bril-
liantly and daringly snatching—as he
had done so often before —victory out of
a near defeat. My writings may have
contributed towards bringing the ALP
issues to a head and towards creating
the political atmosphere Dr Evatt needed
to survive.
But the issues were there long before
I started writing about them, and if in
fact my writings did create any kind of
a political atmosphere within the ALP
it was Dr Evatt who had the capacity
and boldness to exploit the atmosphere

to preserve his leadership and to break
the tightening control of the Santama-
rians over the ALP.
I had been interested in Mr Santa-
maria and what I believed to be the
extraordinary influence he exercised in
the ALP long before the 1954 ALP
split. I did not write about him for a
long time because there is a difference
between believing a man exercises in-
fluence and knowing that he exercises
influence. There was no formal con-
nection between Mr Santamaria and what
was going on in the ALP. Mr Santa-
maria obviously preferred to stay out
of the limelight. As late as October 7,
1954, the day after Dr Evatt delivered
his first blast, Mr Santamaria apparently
felt he was sufficiently detached from
the ALP troubles to be able to say “I
don’t see why I should be connected with
this issue. This is a political business.
It is not in our line.”
It was a relatively minor clash within
the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party
Caucus that first introduced Mr Santa-
maria’s name openly into National
politics. Stan Keon, then Labor MHR
for Yarra (who later was to leave the
ALP and join the DLP) and the late
Mr E. J. Ward, from East Sydney, were
having one of their customary brawls.
Ward attacked Keon who wanted the
Federal Parliamentary Labor Party to
join the Menzies Government’s Foreign
Affairs Committee. Ward was being
heckled. He turned savagely on an inter-
jector and suddenly flung Santamaria’s
name right into the political ring. Santa-
maria, he said, was seeking to dictate
Labor’s foreign policy through the in-
fluence he was exerting on some Caucus
members, particularly Keon. Keon re-
acted furiously. He said it was about
time Labor—and Ward—acquired a
foreign policy more suitable to the
nation’s needs than to a soap box in the
Sydney Domain. Ward should cease
kidding himself that he was the sole
repository of Labor tradition. Retorted
Mr Ward: “That makes two repositories.
Santamaria and me.”
An outcome of that clash was that I
produced on September 21, 1954, under
the heading “The Name That Rings A
Bell In Politics” an article which sketched
in Santamaria’s association with the ALP
and Catholic Action. Thereafter events
moved swiftly. Dr Evatt realised how
he could exploit Santamaria’s strange
until then unpublicised, political role to
re-assert his own position within the
Labor Party, and Labor moved in.
evitably towards the split that took place
formally at the 1955 ALP Federal Con-
ference in Hobart.
The 1964 position of the ALP is simi-
lar in some ways to the position that
existed in 1954 in that, for all practical
purposes, there are again two parties
functioning under the common label of
‘ALP”.
There is the Right-wing ALP tradi-
tionalist group, still numerically the
largest, with many of Dr Evatt’s 1954
supporters still in its ranks, particularly
in NSW. These Right-wingers still want
to combat Communism in the trade
union movement, but to combat it in
such a way that no “outside” organisa-
tion can repeat what happened in 1954
by taking control of ALP operations in
the trade union movement and through
this control establishing “outside” control
over the ALP machine and ALP policy-
making bodies. NSW and to a lesser
extent Tasmania, the two States in which
Labor governments still survive, repre-
sent the Right-wingers’ main surviving
political strongholds.
Ranged against the Right-wingers are
the Left-wingers who, with the Com-
munist Party, were the main heirs to the
Santamarians’ one-time extensive empire
in the industrial field. The Left-wingers
say that the ALP should not intervene in
the industrial field, even though this
policy means leaving the Communists*
and the DLP the only organised
forces in a struggle, success in which
gives the victor a dominant say in ALP
policymaking.
The Left-wingers’ rise to their present
strength stems from two factors. They
were shrewd enough to claim as the*
price of their 1954 support as much of
the Santamarians’ industrial empire as
the ALP could take over. Quite a slab
of the Santamarians’ former industrial
empire reverted to the Communists from
whom it had originally been wrested.
This did not do Left-wing strength anyl-
- within the ALP. Preferring Left-
wingers to Right-wingers, and Left-wing
industrial policies to Right-wing in-
dustrial policies, the Communist Party in
the unions it controls or influences, and
which are usually ALP-affiliated, works
for the selection of delegates to Labor
conferences which will oppose ALP
intervention in the trade union move-
ment. The chain effect of this is that
the longer the ALP refrains from inter-
vention the more delegations go to ALP
policy-making conferences to supped

This aluminium truck body leads a
rugged, exhausting life, carrying coal
for S. & M. Fox Pty. Limited. Now
on its third chassis, it’s showing no
sign of quitting.
S. & M. Fox have been using
Australuco aluminium on truck bodies
and underframes for eight years now.
Over 150 of their trucks have proved
that tough, light aluminium can with-
stand heavy loads and harsh abrasion.
The lightness of aluminium has meant
a reduction of more than 55 per cent
in body weight, resulting in an extra
12 cwt. of carrying capacity.
Of course, there's more to achieve-
ment than aluminium alone. Achieve-
ment also means Australuco’s years of
experience in research, testing, design,
metallurgical improvements . . . years
of practical application which can be
summed up in two words: know-how.
So, when you add technical skill and
expertise to aluminium’s inherent
qualities (no rust or rot, no mainten-
ance, no painting, corrosion resis-
tance), achievement is the natural
result.
Australuco’s engineers and tech-
nicians, backed by the world-wide
experience and knowledge of the
Alcan Group, are able to supply the
latest information about the many
applications of aluminium with its
many versatile alloys in all phases of
Australian industry.

Where the Left-wingers were minor a®
liaries supporting the more importan
anti-Santamarian Right-wingers in 1951
they are probably the major force with!
the ALP in 1964.
Due to their own and Communis
strength in the industrial movement, |
Left-wingers have been able to install 0:
maintain “non-intervention” ALP ext
cutives in Victoria, Queensland att
Western Australia and to exercise
growing influence in South Australia an
through these executives to control the
ALP Federally.
Recently the Right-wing, whoss
strength is concentrated in NSW, ha;
given some indications that it may fo
prepared to fight. The NSW ALP Pre-
sident, Mr Oliver, got the overwhelm'
ing support of the NSW ALP Execute
for the “certifying” of ALP teams it
union elections in defiance of an AL!
Federal directive.
Whether the Right-wing will fight is
open to question. Its reaction to the
Federal ALP directive, prohibiting i|
from carrying on with its “certification"
proposal, could be defensive rather that
aggressive. Other indicators suggest that
the NSW Right-wingers are prepared to
give the entire ALP movement, outside
NSW, away to the Left-wingers if it cat
preserve the Renshaw State Labor’
Government. “If you agree not to inter-
fere in our affairs, we’ll undertake rat
to interfere in yours,” seems a not un-
reasonable interpretation of the NSW
approach to Federal ALP issues in recent
months.
If this interpretation is accurate ani
this approach becomes the basis on which
the two distinct parties now operating
under the label of “ALP” decide to exist
together temporarily, then the ALP has
been handed over to permanent Left-
wing control, Federally, and ultimately
the Left-wing must extend its control
over NSW. Nobody ever won a war, so
far as I know, by defending a fortress
while ceding away an empire.
And even if NSW gets Left-wing
agreement to an armistice, it can only b
a temporary arrangement and not
permanent peace settlement. The Left
wingers make no bones about the fa £l
that they are waging a war —a war the;
are determined to win, even if the prk
of victory includes the fall in NSW«

struggle has not been ended by the
that have passed since 1954. It is stJ
going on between changed armies

Bolte on the Run
Can the DLP save him?
From a Melbourne Correspondent
When Victoria’s Henry Bolte became
the first Liberal Premier in years to
win a majority (18-16) in his Upper
House or Legislative Council, he could
never have expected his triumph to be
so short lived. But the death of the
Liberal member for South Eastern Pro-
vince and the grave illness of Minister
G. Chandler left Bolte to meet Parlia-
ment with the Council numbers 16 all.
The ALP and Country Party drove home
the point, when on the Jewish Day of
Atonement, the Liberals’ Baron Snider,
MLC, could not attend Parliament, by
humiliating the Government and taking
Council business out of its hands.
Bolte cannot look to the South
Eastern by-election this Saturday, Octo-
ber 10, with complete confidence that
his problem will be rectified. • Only
once in history have the Liberals lost
South Eastern in the early ’fifties,
when a Liberal split elected the ALP’s
Gordon Tilley. In the June election,
the Liberals won comfortably with over
60,000 to the ALP’s 48,000 and the
DLP’s 17,000.
But the Bolte Budget could alter all
that.
South Eastern covers the lower half
of the Eastern shores of Port Phillip
Bay and stretches inland to the dairying
and railway town of Korumburra and
the coal town of Wonthaggi. There
is a solid Labor vote in urban Mentone
and Mordialloc; the Eastern rural areas
return a Country Party member to the
Lower House; and there are thousands
of daily commuters in the beach areas,
who are hopping mad about Bolte’s
increases of train fares.
As a result the Country Party deci-
sion to run a candidate —and he is a
particularly good one, prominent in local
affairs—even though an ex-Liberal,
means the seat is a “swinger”.
The Country Party has been cuddling
U P with the ALP in recent years and
although officially it will give no advice
on preferences, unofficially the advice
could be to prefer the ALP—as in the
recent State election. The Country Party
v °ter is being told that the Liberals are
°ut to destroy the Country Party by a
rigged redistribution of seats, and must
be stopped in the Upper House.
There is also an unofficial Liberal
c andidate, who will be no help to Bolte,
as he claims to be standing as a protest.
The ALP is cock-a-hoop over the
Budget and claims a winning
chance in South Eastern. Because eco-
nomic issues of wages, prices, uniform
tax and the like will loom large in the
by-election, some Labor men wanted the
Australian Council of Trade Unions Re-
search Officer, Mr R. J. L. Hawke, as
candidate. The Victorian ALP Execu-
tive was cold on the idea and chose a
school teacher, Cathie, who is a faithful
Executive supporter and whose views
approximate to those of Dr Cairns.
With DLP preferences, Bolte should
win the seat, but it could be close.
If the unexpected happens, and the
ALP wins, a State election on the Bud-
get could be forced. Both the ALP and
Country Party would be pledged to vote
against Supply and force an election as
Hollway did to the Cain Labor Govern-
ment in 1947.
TRADERS
Death of a
Salesman
Not a Royal Commission
FROM RUSSELL SCHNEIDER IN SYDNEY
Oydney’s small shopkeepers were dis-
appointed last week when City
Coroner J. J. Loomes pointed out his
court was not a Royal Commission on
trading hours. Mr Loomes was in-
quiring into the death of Fairlight shop-
keeper Tom Allan, who suffered a stroke
in Long Bay jail on August 18 and died
in hospital seven hours later.
The small traders had demanded a
full inquiry into Allan’s death. But
what they wanted most was an inquiry
into the reason for Allan’s imprisonment
—refusal to pay a £4 10s. after-hours
trading fine. They wanted to know why
an “obviously ill” man had been taken
to jail.
When the inquiry began, however,
Mr Loomes made it clear that he would
not extend the inquest beyond time,
place and cause of death.
After listening to 29 witnesses, inclu-
ding police, warders and convicts, Mr
Loomes said he was satisfied no one
could be blamed for Allan’s death. Im-
prisonment had not caused the fatal
stroke, he said, and absence of a doctor
had not contributed to Allan's death.
But he urged jail officials to appoint a
full-time resident medical officer to fill
a four-month-old vacancy at the jail.
“In such a position as Allan’s, I feel
a prudent man would —and perhaps
should—consider the interests of his
family and his own well being as opposed
to any principle he felt involved,” the
Coroner said. “Allan decided to serve
the sentence rather than pay the fine.
But the evidence is that his death could
have occurred anywhere, at any time.”
BUSINESS
Share Dealers
Should brokers be directors of
public companies?
FROM J. C. HORSFALL
TL/lelbourne finance editors raised a
A likely-looking hare when on a search
of the share register of Second Century
Corporation Ltd, a finance offshoot of
Wnj. Noall and Son, Melbourne stock-
brokers, they discovered the managing
director Mr R. W. Carroll and his wife
had disposed of some large parcels of
the company’s shares between the issue
of a favorable interim report and the
ultimate revelation of a loss for the year.
Some companies including the “Mel-
bourne Herald”, strongly opposed to the
compulsory interim reports now required
under the Stock Exchange’s new listing
rules, immediately got on the band-
wagon, pointing out interim reports
could often be misleading and were only
food for share traders and speculators
“who want to see new life pumped into
the market all the time”.
Politicians were also aroused and one
of them, Mr Baron Snider, MLC, chal-
lenged, as I have been doing for years,
whether members of the Stock Exchange
should be permitted also to be directors
of public companies. Speaking in the
Legislative Council, Mr Snider said some
stockbrokers who were company direc-
tors had to sit on a board making vital
decisions affecting the future of the com-
pany, and which could affect the value
of the company’s shares on the Stock
Exchange. Next day, “under another
cloak”, the broker was consulted by a
client on the desirability of buying shares
in the same company. “I do not know
how he cuts himself in half, and shuts
out of his mind the knowledge he
acquired the day before as a director and
then advises clients to the best of his
ability, and with the best intentions of
impartiality, on the question of their
share purchases.”
In my view the only way the conflict
of interests can be resolved is by legisla-

A Vision
Everything except “radiant”
FROM HUGH CURNOW IN SYDNEY
the moment when the Sydney
"Daily Mirror” hit the streets with
its first, unflattering, full-length picture
of Princess . Marina on the front page
headed “A VISION IN CHERRY RED”,
it was on again. Stories that followed
the progress of Australia’s latest royal
visitor endorsed the feeling of one’s
having read (or written) it all before.
At Canberra airport she was reported
to have paused before a crowd of
“nearly 1000” and stated: “Isn't it a
beautiful morning?” This remark, to-
gether with the placing of a royal, gloved
hand under the chin of a nearby five-
year-old, was hailed in the Sunday papers
as “a discard of all formality”. The
Princess’s “gaiety and informality” had
charmed all who set eyes on her, we were
told. “PRINCESS MARINA LIKES
TO TALK” announced “The Sun”,
authoritatively.
The “Sunday Mirror’s” placing of an
exclamation mark after its predictable
headline “PRINCESS CHARMING!”
added little emotional feeling to the two
pictures underneath. One, out of focus,
made the Princess appear young. The
other, sharply in focus, made her appear
old.
“She carried out the inspection with
perfect poise but I noticed a slightly
nervous movement of her fingers,” one
“Sunday Mirror” reporter wrote, intri-
guingly. What was that nervous move-
ment? Were the royal fingers shaking?
Or clenching and unclenching, perhaps?
We probably shall never know.
We were told all about the Princess’s
“mingling”, though. In one story the
“SMH” described her as “dazzling”. All
Sydney sub-editors, however, seemed
agreed on one omission: whatever else
she may have been, this Princess was
spared the “radiant” label.
What emerged, with a sense of the
inevitable, was a “regal figure” who
either “chose” or “wore” elaborately-
described clothes; loves gaiety, enjoys
crowds, children, planting trees, delay-
ing schedules, and meeting Greeks; can
smile happily, informally, mischievously,
impishly, charmingly and winsomely;
and is “as happy as a schoolgirl” to be
in Australia. What may remain, how-
ever, if only by the medium of television,
is the picture of a friendly woman who
looks exactly what she is: 57, well-
dressed, tall and thin.

Losing Interest
If Russia won the Davis Cup ...
BY DISCUS
fk ustralia and the US have owned the
Davis Cup since 1937 when Budge,
Parker and Mako ended the four-year
British run which had followed France’s
six years of greatness. For nearly 30
years we have become used to the
almost annual arrival or departure of
the Cup, until the supposed international
trophy has become as traditional a sym-
bol as The Ashes.
This year’s win produced a strange lack
of interest in Australia. As soon as the
Cup was secure, it ceased to be of news
interest. Two morning newspapers in
F. STOLLE
R. EMERSON
different States had editorials remarking
on this phenomenon, which they were
also generating. A television company not
yet operating bought sole rights to the
film. By noon Tuesday the only remain-
ing public interest was in whether Roy
Emerson might turn pro. and even that
was lukewarm.
It is not necessarily a bad thing to
have this annual Australia-US contest.
It reduces world interest in the Davis
Cup, particularly at the inter-zone level,
but it increases the interest in the
French, British and American national
championships, and in women's tennis.
The giants can always be tumbled in
tournaments, even if they can’t in Davis
Cup.
The situation could change. The
Russians are directing their resources to
the creation of a strong Davis Cup team.
If they ever succeed, the Cup could go
to Moscow and remain there a long
time. Once on top, Russian lawn ten-
nis would be unlikely to offer the stan-
dard “expenses” for visiting inter-
nationals, although the Russian titles
would then be the ones to win. At this
point we might see an “open” Davis Cup.
Opens have been on the International
Lawn Tennis Federation agenda since
1959 when a special committee recom-
mended them. The open or amateur
question does not affect present tennis
outcomes. But if the Russian “amateurs”
come up trumps, the Australian and
American professionals could quickly
win the Cup back and hold it for a long
time.
Australia’s power in Davis Cup tennis
benefits the people in this country who
like to see the game at its best. When
we hold the Cup we can attract a few
top internationals to our national tourna-
ments. Without the Cup and the in-
come it brings we would see few inter-
nationals, if Maria Bueno’s asking price
of £2500 for expenses is any guide.
So much for the practical aspects.
There is also an ethical question, which
is pleasantly ignored. After 30 years at
the top, should the LTAA consider try-
ing to develop further opposition by
lending some lesser players and coaches
to countries such as the Philippines,
India, Japan? Very often a country will
develop one good player, but it needs
two or three to have Davis Cup hopes.
PSYCHOLOGY
This is “Science"
University research today?
Qince it reveals far more about the
level of inquiry conducted by some
fringe groups in Australian Universities
than any detailed survey might do, we
publish the following extracts without
comment.
They are from the 1963-64 Annual
Report of the British Psychological
Society, Australian Branch, and were
written by Mr R. J. Thomson, of the
University of Sydney, in Attachment B
to a Report of the Working Party to
Evaluate Research Evidence Concerning
the Effects on Children’s Attitudes of
Exposure to Mass Media Emphasising
Crime and Violence. The Report was
prepared by Mr Thomson, Mr S. H.
Lovibond and Mr R. Newell.
“/"Vne newspaper peddles an astonishing
weekly magazine compounded
mainly of top-dressed kitsch and re-
actionary propaganda, apparently func-
tioning as a guilt-reducing device for
the sycophants who edit it as well as all
those pseudo - libertarians down town
who have sold out their entire right
to express any social protest and have
need of a crypto-fascist confessional
mystique to hide the abominable magni-
tude of their betrayal from themselves.”
“TVT any reasons h ave recently been ad-
-1 * vanced for the decline of the Labor
movement in Australia, and of the ALP
in particular. In fact a sufficient expla-
nation may be found in the constant and
ruthless exercise, extending over decades,
of monopoly propaganda directed by
Press, radio, and ultimately television,
against all the forces of enlightened pro-
gress represented by the Australian Labor
movement.”
“rj%E artists, thinkers, scientists and
A academics who sell out on the terms
offered join the throng of newspaper
editors, television quizmasters, teenage
marketeers and all those other flunkies
who have, for a consideration, consented
to dedicate themselves in real earnest to
the black deprivation of the spirit of man.
There is a place reserved for all these
people, in the innermost circle of Dante.
In the meantime their state-subsidised
piracy of the public good appears even
to enjoin a permanent moratorium on any
move to relieve, in no matter how modest
degree, the misery and anguish of all
those unfortunates throughout the world
who have the capitalist oppressor still
sitting firmly astride their shoulders. This
is upheld in the name of the so-called
‘pluralist’ society . . . According to this
monstrous creed, the young most devo-
tedly re-consecrate the sad unquiet grave
of Anna May Christie in Birmingham,
Alabama, USA, by continuing placidly
to suck coke through a straw while the
juke-box thunders ‘Can’t Buy Me Love’,
etc. In fact, under capitalism today
money can buy anything one cares to
name, it would seem, except an honest
conscience or the rights of Man.
“W HAT * s t 0 done?
” “A new generation of intellectual
progressives and activists must be re-
cruited to reinforce the ‘thin red line’ of
resistance to monopoly capitalism and all
its degrading anti-humanism . . .
“Presumably, therefore, one supports
all uncommitted or Left-wing groups in
the unremitting struggle against ‘kitsch’
anti-humanism, and the secretly ‘persua-
sive’ manipulations of the capitalist Press
and the other mass media, especially
commercial TV. Presumably, if one does
not do this, one is prepared for apathe-
tic resignation when the first major
external crisis we experience is found to
bring outright political fascism treading
hard on the heels of the current, econo-
mically rigged crypto-fascism under the
secret misrule of the piratically greedy
and monstrously self-opinionated capb
talist empire-builder.”


“When I travel I don’t want to waste time.
I can’t afford to. That’s why I flew Pan Am

I need an airline that flies everywhere—

As Mr. Higson found out, world-wide
connections make a world of difference
on a long business trip. Pan Am’s con-

leave when he wants to, arrive when he
has to. The reason? Pan Am flies more

Patronage as public relations
By PATRICIA ROLFE
When artist Mr William Dobell was
told last month that he had won
£5OOO, the first annual Britannica Aus-
tralia award for art, he admitted that he
had never heard of the award. How-
ever, he accepted the £5OOO and men-
tioned that he would use the money to
buy some antique furniture.
This result must have been somewhat
disappointing for the Encyclopaedia
Britannica people, who have another
four award winners, in literature, edu-
cation, science and medicine, to be
announced in forthcoming weeks. The
award is the firm’s first venture into
patronage of the arts and sciences. If
its generosity hadn’t yet penetrated to
people who might be on the receiving
end, it seemed unlikely that it had made
much public impact. And public rela-
tions is today a legitimate part of
patronage.
The Britannica award was not only
commendably large, but there was no
assumption that giving a sum to an
artist involves buying him work, body
and soul. The judges could, too, have
chosen no one who in the public mind is
more worthy of honor, although as a
nation we might show our appreciation
of Dobell with more sensibility by pass-
ing a law, similar to that which exists in
France, to protect the artist’s equity in
his work. This could mean that when
works which Mr Dobell sold originally
for a few hundred pounds now change
hands for thousands, there would be
some benefit, a rough equivalent to
writers’ royalties, to him.
The Britannica Australia awards and
the two fellowships which the Austra-
lian National University has instituted
have made 1964 a year of promise so
far as the creative arts are concerned.
That is so long as you can forget that
it is a long while since the daily papers
thought winners of £6OOO in the NSW
State Lottery worth mentioning, and
that the £5O a week offered by the ANU
is about the going rate for junior execu-
tives, and the fellowships offer no fringe
benefits, unless you count living in Can-
berra for a year.
More is being offered for the creative
arts, both by Governments and business,
but patronage still largely remains un-
sophisticated, often misdirected, some-
times high-handed and occasionally
totally unintelligent. That is, of course,
the way it seems to those who are likely
to be on the receiving end.
The basic point is that more is still
not enough. There isn’t anything to
cover mistakes, disappointments and
gallant tries. There isn’t anything for
some arts, such as film-making, which
remain almost totally overlooked.
And, too, it must be a law of eco-
nomics that Government minimums,
represented by the Commonwealth Liter-
ary Fund and the Art Advisory Board,
tend to become Government maximums.
One composer linked poor support of
the arts with Australia’s reluctance to
spend enough on education. A country
which will not pay to educate its child-
ren well could hardly get used to the
idea that development of the arts costs
money.
There is the continued pull between
competitions and direct commissions.
Most bodies are wedded to competitions,
simply because that way you can see
more for your money. Not only is there
a weakness for competitions but, par-
ticularly in literature, there is a fondness
for giving first, second, third prizes, even
a list of commended. The Miles Frank-
lin judges, with schoolmarmly zeal, fol-
low this pattern. Last year, it became
known, almost certainly not through the
judges, that Morris West had entered
“The Shoes of the Fisherman” and
hadn’t even been commended. You can
almost feel the rap on the knuckles.
“You’ll have to do better next time,
Morris. You may be a best-selling
author, but don’t think you can fool us
for a moment.”
Conditions of competitions, and even
commissions, are sometimes laid down on
a blueprint of what the organiser wants
and seemingly with not a fleeting thought
ol what the artist is likely to produce.
A model of this sort of competition
is the Australian Broadcasting Commis-
sion’s Poetry Award for 1965, announced
a few days ago. The ABC is offering
£250 for a poem, “with the desire”, says
the entry form, “of encouraging the
writing of poetry for the ear, as distinct
from for the eye”. The poem, it cautions,
“should communicate its essential quality
and be readily understandable at first
hearing”. These conditions might place
severe restrictions on inspiration, but the
ABC has its programmes “The Poet’s
Tongue” and “Quality Street” in mind.
It must avoid those awkward silences.
However, it wants poetry in chunks. The
poem, “should not be shorter than 20
minutes broadcasting time and not longer
than 30 minutes broadcasting time”.
“What do they expect us to do?” said
one poet, casting the form from him.
“Work it out with a stop-watch. They
want something as long as ‘Childe
Harold’. And they’ll probably get some-
thing like ‘Childe Harold’.”
In terms of cash laid on the line and
of variety of awards, art, of course, re-
ceives the greatest help.

quarter publish a list of current prizes,
scholarships and contests. These range
from the Archibald, Rubinstein, Wills,
George and Transfield through to the
suburban and country shire and munici-
pal awards which might run down to £lO.
From the “Art and Australia” lists
and those furnished to artists by State
Galleries it is easy to run up £20,000
and more offered each year. Of course,
no artist, no matter how frenzied, would
be eligible to enter, much less win, more
than a small proportion of these. How-
ever, several artists, now established, in
earlier days made both income and repu-
tation on the art circuit.
Most critics and artists have a tolerant
attitude towards the art contests orga-
nised by towns and suburbs for their
annual festivals. They feel they do no
harm even if they do no good. These
experts put them in the same fun-of-the-
fair class as the oyster-eating or pan-
cake-tossing contest. There are many
honorable exceptions, such as Mildura’s
sculpture awards.
/Generally it is the people with the
most money to spend who seem most
anxious to throw it in the wrong direc-
tion. Last year, in the American “The
Critic”, art critic Frank Getlein vividly
outlined the general run of art patronage
in the United States.
“The dabbling that takes place,” Mr
Getlein wrote, “is usually connected with
some anniversary of the sponsoring com-
pany and it is always weighed against
the artist both as artist and as skilled
worker trying to make a living. The
gimmick hit upon by most business out-
fits wishing to celebrate their continued
existence through art is a competition.
From an accounting office point of view,
the competition has the great merit of
not costing very much in dollars actually
paid for art, though there often seems to
be no limit to the amount available for
the trimmings. The approach is basically
like that of a cook who puts out a turkey
dinner with mountains of mashed pota-
toes, bogs of cranberries, heaps of dress-
ing, turnips, celery and olives and even
cigars at the end, but all this centred on
a platter of shrivelled-down hamburgers.
“The hamburgers in the parable re-
present the artist’s share in most industry-
sponsored art competitions. Everything
dse is for everyone else: executives and
their wives, public relations and adver-
tising specialists, even art journalists, the
inclusion of whom shows vividly how
desperate the management Maecenas is
to throw his art money in any direction
exce Pt the artist’s. Having taken costly
jTace and time to announce the project,
having retained the costly services of art
m agazine editors to advise and later to
accept free costly color plates, and having
staged an endless series of expensive din-
ners and parties for anyone remotely
interested in the field of art and/or the
firm’s product, the sponsor will hopefully
line up the cream of the nation’s artists
to compete for a single prize—thus
assuring at least one and possibly several
preliminary exhibitions in which every-
thing is paid for except the art.”
Mr Getlein’s strictures have echoes
here but the American art market is
much more complicated and sophisticated
than ours.
It seems that these days most modern
Maecenas here consult art critics or gal-
lery heads before embarking on a contest
or giving a prize. This means that even
if the original idea of the business firm
to get the most for the least is persisted
with, the least can be directed more
efficiently towards the artist.
The Viscount collection in its way was
considered by art experts as a model of
one type of patronage. Seven paintings
were commissioned, were sent on tour
throughout the Commonwealth and will
be dispersed to the State galleries.

The Bulletin’s art critic, Mr John
llenshaw, who has acted as judge tor a
number of competitions, believes they
have very little to do with standards. He
agreed that quite a number are not sup-
ported by leading artists.
“A committee judgment is often a com-
promise,” he said. “It is virtually im-
possible to say that one style is better
than another. And there are very pecu-
liar fashions in artists. One yeai an
artist seems to win everything, the next
year it’s another. Rodney Milgate has
recently been pretty popular. Another
thing is the prevalence of some paintings.
These will turn up in one competition
as a still life, in another as an industrial
landscape.”
Music is almost certainly the worst
served of the arts, receiving virtually no
support outside bodies involved in music,
such as the ABC, Musica Viva and the
Elizabethan Theatre Trust. There is still
no equivalent to the Commonwealth
Literary Fund and the Art Advisory
Board to cover composers. There pro-
bably will be one day. Apparently now
it is only a matter of waiting “until the
Prime Minister gets around to it”.
After that, it will depend on who is
appointed to a board what sort of help
composers get. However, Professor
Donald Peart, Professor of Music at the
University of Sydney, is firmly opposed
to contests and just as strongly in favor of
direct commissions.
Professor Peart has what might be
called a promising stable of young com-
posers, including Peter Sculthorpe and
Eric Gross, in his department at the
moment and is in touch with most of the
others. Many of the problems of the
composer, as he describes them, are
peculiar to music and seem to be par-
ticularly trying.
Whereas an artist can struggle out of
his garret to the nearest coffee shop and
persuade the owner to put his paintings
on the wall, and the writer can go to a
“vanity” press, musical composition has
no reality until it is performed. It can-
not be performed, unless it is a solo work,
until the parts have been transcribed.
Music copying is an expensive business,
and, Professor Peart said, the average
composer hasn’t the penmanship and
would be very foolish to give the time to
doing the job himself. Even then, one
set of parts does not get him far towards
further performances or eventual publi-
cation.
Literature still seems to be the field
given over most strictly to the competi-
tion and in which judges are most anxious
to confirm their power by awarding first,
second and third prizes. Riffling through
dozens or hundreds of manuscripts must
rate as an interesting tactile experience.
T>alanced against this is the somewhat
unnerving sixth sense among authors
about which competitions to enter and
which to avoid. The Adelaide “Adver-
tiser” contest, held in conjunction with
the Festival of the Arts, offers rich prizes
but hasn’t consistently attracted authors
of standing. Other literary prizes, such
as the Mary Gilmore and the Miles
Franklin, tend to become shrines, without
much thought being given to whether they
serve today’s purposes, and without much
hope, wills being what they are, of their
being changed.
The failure of the judges in this year’s
General Motors’ playwriting contest to
find one play worth giving a prize to
seems to underline that in this field at
least competitions are not the answer.
However, the donors have merely
switched their target and next year the
award will go to theatre and costume
design. The failure of the General
Motors’ award makes more interesting
the outcome of J. C. Williamson’s com-
missioning Mr David Martin to turn his
successful novel “The Young Wife” into
a play for professional production.
Competitions cannot be dismissed out
of hand. In the past they have rarely
failed to find talent. But where are the
second and third plays of award win-
ners? And even the second and third
novels of award winners? Obviously,
something more sensible and sympathe-
tic in the way of help is needed before
we uncover these.

On the Margin
The Lay of the Land
‘TFhis book explains nuclear physics
A in simple language that can be
understood by laymen.” I read the
words with some irritation, and
showed them to another layman. He
agreed that they were typical of the
condescending attitude adopted to-
wards us by experts.
The layman is always referred to as
a person of boundless ignorance. His
only apparent function is to have
things explained to him. His intelli-
gence is so low that he must be
addressed in simple language. How-
ever much he is told, he is never given
credit for grasping it or remembering
it. The layman’s job is to remain un-
informed, while at the same time
being passionately eager for informa-
tion.
That is perhaps what annoys us
laymen most the way we are sup-
posed to hang on the words of our
instructors. It never seems to occur
to them that we have interests of our
own. In reality many lay-
men lead full and normal
lives without the help of
experts. They marry lay-
women, who prepare lay-
ettes, and have happy
families of laychildren.
They do not spend all
their time dutifully taking
notes while know - alls
lecture to them in simple language.
The status of the laywoman is a
matter for separate consideration.
Now and again an expert will deliver
a few patronising remarks to her, but
more often she is ignored altogether.
In her social position the laywoman
is even below the layman.
Things were not always like this.
In past times authorities were polite
to laymen and treated them as equals.
The authors of the Bible, for example,
did not make a song and dance about
the book's simple, easy-to-read style.
They just went ahead and wrote it.
Nowadays they would probably call it
Teach Yourself Christianity—a Handy-
Guide for the Layman.
I have discussed the situation with
lay people of both sexes. There is a
surprising amount of feeling on the
subject. Fred Wilkins, a well-known
layman, put it this way: “Although
the experts look down on us, they
need us. They would starve if lay-
men stopped reading books on archae-
ology and African politics. Or if lay-
women gave up studying Italian or
cake-decorating.”
Mr Wilkins pointed out that the
books which experts write make heavy
demands on a layman’s time. And
he gets small thanks for reading them.
Mrs Nora Effingham, a popular lay-
woman of our district, said: “To me
it is a question of manners. I don’t
ask experts to stop writing books on
chess or Florentine art. All 1 ask
is for them to refrain from saying
hurtful things like ‘Even the lay-
woman will be interested’, etc. The
laywoman is not a moron —she is
your wife.”
Laymen could retaliate by writing
books or articles themselves, but they
are under a disadvantage. People
will not listen to a layman because
he is not an expert at anything. Yet
there is one subject, at
least, which he knows
something about him-
self. The layman is an
authority on laymen. It is
here, I think, that he has
the best chance of raising
himself to a position of
greater respect.
A campaign should be
launched to present laymen in an
attractive light. I have in mind those
photographs of managers which
banks and other businesses publish in
an effort (not always entirely success-
ful) to inspire public confidence.
A picture of Aubrey Dingwood,
BA, would carry a caption saying:
“Mr Dingwood, young and alert,
well-educated but without narrow 7
specialisation, is typical of our best
laymen.” Other pictures and articles
would show the model home life of
laymen and laywomen.
In particular I would like to see a
solid piece of research done, entitled
The Australian Layman : A Sociologi-
cal Survey. It would say on the
jacket “this book is written in turgid,
technical language that can be under-
stood by experts.”

No Respect for
“Gallant Losers”
Turning in their graves like ships' propellers
By RONALD MILLAR
Yet another British attempt to wrest
the America’s Cup away from the
United States has ended in dismal
failure. More dismal still is the grow-
ing realisation by British yachtsmen that
this could have been the last chance to
return the Holy Grail of yacht racing
to its native heath.
The reason is all too painfully clear.
Twelve-metre yachts are notoriously ex-
pensive toys and the number of people
in Great Britain with both the en-
thusiasm and the odd quarter of a million
pounds or so that it takes to mount a
challenge of this nature are not very
thick on the ground.
So the America’s Cup is likely to stay
where it has been for the past 113 years,
unless the Americans relent and allow
the race to be fought out between less
expensive yachts, or there is a success-
ful challenge from another quarter, such
as Australia.
This must be a bitter pill for British
yachtsmen to swallow. And, surely,
the original members of the Royal Yacht
Squadron, who first put up the cup in
1851, must be turning in their graves
like so many ships’ propellers. There is
little doubt that the “old guard” would
have snorted with disgust at the reports
that the British crew were “gallant and
gracious losers”.
Humble submissions didn’t seem to
have been their strong point. In fact,
the origins of the club were in a strong
dislike of extravagant manners.
At the beginning of the 18th century
certain gentlemen were becoming rather
tired of “Beau” Brummell and his cro-
uies. Quite a lot of them had been
excluded from the right sort of clubs by
these posturing dandies. So a number
of them who hankered after club life
and had a common interest in yachting,
decided to form a club at Cowes of their
own. the qualifications for membership
were quite modest. The members had to
be owners of yachts of not less than
ten tons, and the subscription was to be
three guineas a year.
After Waterloo, the club did not
want for famous members. Among
them was that fine cavalry officer, the
Marquess of Anglesey, who at the time
of the club’s formation in 1815 was in
Belgium at the side of the Duke of Wel-
lington. Anglesey was a master of under-
statement. Seated on his horse, watch-
ing the deployment of his troops at
Waterloo, a cannon ball took his leg off
neatly below the knee. He turned to
Wellington and calmly remarked, “By
God, I have lost me leg.” The Duke,
misled by Anglesey’s tone, just grunted
an acknowledgment. It wasn’t until
after the battle that the Iron Duke be-
came aware of what Anglesey was trying
to tell him.
But despite the club’s original inten-
tions, the fashionable set did move in.
The Prince Regent, still smarting from
the famous “fat friend” taunt from the
fearless “Beau” Brummell, expressed a
desire to become a member. After be-
coming king he consented to the club
being known as the Royal Yacht Club,
and since that time its members have
been permitted to fly the White Ensign.
In addition, the reigning monarch has
borne the title of Admiral of the Squad-
ron.
By this time, the Isle of Wight had be-
come as popular as any watering place.
With the defeat of Napoleon and the
coming of peace in Europe, all the
fashionables of the day thronged to the
island. At the theatre “Mr Shadford and
his Favorite Company” delighted packed
audiences. There was hardly an evening
when a gala ball failed to “enliven the
night until Phoebus announced the
commencement of a new day”. For the
non-dancers “Mr Clarke’s philosophical
fireworks enriched the heavens with
beauteous glories”.
The club members of those days were
quite casual about their yachting. With
their blue coats and white trousers they
often appeared to be far more nautical
than they really were. In fact many of
them manifested a strong dislike of going
out of sight of land.
But as confined as the yacht racing
was, vast sums changed hands on the
outcome. It was not unusual for several
thousands to be wagered on the result of
a single race. And the yachts themselves
were expensive; nothing being spared to
give them the most sumptuous accom-
modation and the finest possible suits of
sails.
The owners and their guests lived
aboard in tremendous style and had the
finest cuisine available. For instance,
in appearance, Lord Yarborough’s 351-
ton yacht was not unlike a 20-gun man-
of-war. Her captain was a Royal Navy
lieutenant and she carried a crew of 54
“choice hands”. The latter were almost
certainly from the same source because
of their willingness to submit to the
harsh naval discipline of the times.
The “usefulness” of flogging
A visitor aboard Falcon wrote: “The
honest tars (tars were always honest
in those days) are so convinced of the im-
possibility of being properly managed
without due sense of the cat-o’-nine tails,
that they have fully consented to its law-
ful application aboard, and ’ere Falcon
left Plymouth Sound, all hands cordially
signed a paper setting forward the use-
fullness of a sound flogging, and their
perfect willingness to undergoe the ex-
perience, whenever deemed necessary,
for the preservation of good order”.
One is prompted to think that unem-
ployment and hunger were more respon-
sible for the “honest tars’ ” willingness
to undergo that brutal naval punishment,
than any love of efficiency and good
order.
The majority of the yachts carried
brass cannon, and an armory of small
arms and cutlasses. The former were
for firing salutes but I’m afraid that the
latter were often used for a less peaceful
purpose.
Mr Weld’s yacht Lulworth was about
to cross the finishing line, but came into
collision with Louise owned by Lord Bel-
fast. When they observed that some

0/7 f/7e day you sell it, you'll pick up another great reason
for owning a Volkswagen.
Obviously, we’re talking about the big
cheque you’ll get from the new owner.
And there are good reasons why used VW
prices stay consistently high.
In a sense, the older a VW gets, the
more valuable it gets, so that in five
years time, the same Volkswagen will be
worth more than some five-year-old cars
that cost a lot more to begin with.
All old Volkswagens are worth a lot,
because a lot of people want them. One
reason is that it takes a real fanatic to
tell a clean, used one from a clean, new
one. VWs always look like VWs.
And, old or new, there's all that nice
money you keep saving on oil, tyres and
repairs.
Which means you can get a good price

want to sell.)

rigging had become entangled, “Louise’s
crew drew their knives and cutlasses and
cut away the ’earing of Lulworth’s boom
and her reef pendant”. The crew of
the other yacht immediately retaliated
in like fashion. It must have looked
rather like a scene from Trafalgar. As
the race had taken place at night, the
water was ablaze with colored lights and
from “Mr Clarke’s philosophical fire-
works” which hissed and banged over-
head. In the flickering shadows, the two
crews could be seen running about the

at each other’s rigging.

at the swordplay, but that they were
late for dinner at the club. But later,

indignation and port, swore that, in
future, if any yacht crossed his bows
while he was on the starboard tack, he
would “cut her in two”. To which his
fellow members countered that if this
was the case, in future he could race
alone.
Joker and thug
rpms had a sequel. A few days later,
A Lord Belfast turned up at the start of
the race for the Duke of Gloucester’s
Cup and found that he had no opposi-
tion. Lowering a boat, he prevailed on
two friends with very small yachts to
make it a race and him eligible for the
cup. But the race committee would have
none of this one-sided affair, with-
drew the cup and returned Belfast’s
entrance fee. In a towering rage, Lord
Belfast fired his own starting gun, and
again lowered his boat and placed within
it his coxswain and entrance fee, with
strict instructions for it to be handed to
the recalcitrant committee. The latter
refused the offer and the coxswain slunk
back to Louise. But Belfast was deter-
mined. He manoeuvred his yacht along-
side the committee boat, threw the
entrance fee on to the deck, and set off
in pursuit of the small yachts, which he
soon overhauled and outsailed. But
when he returned as a conquering hero,
he found that the committee had gone
home and he was left to dance about
alone on his well-scrubbed teak decks, in
helpless fury.
Another member was that notorious
practical joker and thug, the Marquess
of Waterford, who became a member in
1832. Waterford was a magnificent
specimen of humanity, and could easily
lift a 15-stone man with one hand. His
favorite sport was engaging in bouts
of fisticuffs with low draymen and
butchers, the strong men of the times.
But he was more remarkable for a
rare sense of humor. He put aniseed on
fhe hooves of a local parson’s horse and

then hunted the poor wretch, with a
pack of bloodhounds, half across the
county of Leicestershire. He thought
little or nothing of his personal safety,
either. One day, while running before
the wind aboard his yacht Gem his cap
blew off. Without hesitation, he promptly
followed it over the side. By the time
his captain had brought the yacht up
into the wind and returned to find him,
Waterford had been swept away by the
strong current. He was eventually picked
up, more dead than alive.
When at home, after dinner when the
port had circulated well and conversa-
tion was beginning to flag, Waterford
was accustomed to shooting the eyes out
of the portraits of his ancestors with a
pistol.
He finally met his end, at the age of
50, when his horse rolled on him after
being put at a gate three times. Young
though he was, when one considers his
reckless life, it is remarkable that he
lasted so long.
Squadron leaves home
Tt cannot be denied that these gentlemen
* with their fiery tempers and their
love of a good fight or a practical joke
often overstepped the bounds of dignity
and good behavior. But some of them
did a lot of good, sometimes unwittingly.
Lord Belfast, for instance, was directly
responsible for the improvement in de-
sign of Royal Navy ships. Nothing gave
him greater pleasure than to wait out-
side Portsmouth Harbor in his brig, and
then outsail the men-of-war on all points
cf the wind. He would even shorten sail
and leave them far astern. So the Navy
purchased his brig and used her as a
design trial horse with the result that
warships began to move a lot swifter
through the water.
But the Squadron had begun to leave
its home waters and venture further
afield. The White Ensign of the club
was to be seen as far east as Constanti-
nople and in the Baltic. Cowes Week
had become the high spot of the social
season. And more important, yachting
had started its long journey towards the
days when it would no longer be, en-
tirely, a rich man’s sport.

rose over the elms outside, and with the
coming of that day there dawned the
Victorian era.
It was this regal lady who, 14 years
later, graciously acknowledged from the
deck of the Victoria and Albert the arri-
val of a yacht with a black hull and “two
sticks of extreme rake”. She had come
from overseas to compete for the Royal
Yacht Squadron Cup, as it was then
called. She was named simply the

Ballerina, Export Quality
“All great artists are simple people ”
By CHARLES SRIBER
a A ustralians seem to nurse an in-
feriority complex,” Kathleen
Gorham said. “We never feel
we are as good as anyone from over-
seas.” Compact and tiny prima ballerina
Miss Gorham had just finished a rehear-
sal. She sat in one of the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust’s rather grim rehearsal
rooms and smoked a cigarette. “I don’t
know why this is.” She spread her
hands, “look how well our people have
fared when they have gone out into the
big world. I’d say at least 90 per cent of
our artists find work and many get up
around the top.”
She was vigorously supporting a so far
tentative proposal to send the Australian
Ballet Company overseas next year. The
company has been invited to perform
at the Commonwealth Festival in Lon-
don next September. “Are our stand-
ards sufficiently high?” Miss Gorham
shrugged, “Oh, we might take a few
knocks, but that's part of the struggle of
growing up. Other countries, less well
prepared, haven't hesitated to send their
companies overseas.”
Judging from her own experiences the
chances of success are by no means
dim. Since her original departure from
Australia, she has danced with Roland
Petit, Sadler’s Wells and the Paris com-
pany of the Marquis de Cuevas. Her
tours have included many European
capitals and the Middle East. Her Paris
debut earned her enthusiastic front-page
stories in five of that city’s daily papers.
She clenched her fist and narrowed
her brown eyes as she asserted her belief
in Australian talent. “I’m terribly
patriotic about Australia,” she said.
I ve never regretted leaving Europe to
come home and work here and I'll stay
with the company in the hope that I’ll be
able to go overseas again as a member
of our own ballet group.
Any inspiration I have had to achieve
success has come from this country. I
was born in Narrandera, but my family
came to Sydney when I was little and we
settled in Sylvania so I really think of
oivself as a Sydneyite. My mother sent
rne along to elocution lessons and ballet
classes and I learned the piano, but I
relented practising an dgave that up. The
ballet lessons were pretty routine and I'm
not sure I took those so seriously either.
“The lessons went on every week until
I was 14. Then mother said she thought
I had acquired a basic background of
dancing and needn't continue any longer.
But I've always been a contrary sort of
person and as soon as I found I didn’t
have to study dancing I decided I wanted
to continue.
“The following year, at 15, I joined
the Borovansky Company and stayed
with them until the company disbanded.
The Ballet Rambert was in Australia at
the time and Madame Rambert invited
me to join her. After two or three weeks
they put me into leading roles. When
the tour ended I decided to go to England
with them and it was while in London
that Roland Petit saw me dance. I was
with him for three months and then I
was offered a scholarship with the Sad-
ler’s Wells Ballet School where Peggy
Van Praagh was teaching. I accepted,
went into the company and stayed with
them for two years.”
T mentioned the rigors and discipline
of the ballet and Kathleen Gorham
frowned. “Of course, discipline is essen-
tial. But I think mine is the hardest
profession bar none. It’s a vocation and
you have to have it, otherwise you simply
can’t stay with it.
“It isn’t only a matter of physical
effort. It takes so much out of you
mentally too. I doubt if I could ever be
as dedicated as Fonteyn or Nureyev.
When they have an evening performance
they withdraw and compose themselves
and concentrate on it for hours before-
hand. Everything takes second place to
their absolute concentration ready for
the raising of the curtain. I’m too inter-
ested in other things. If there was an
art exhibition I wanted to see and I had
the choice between that or a rehearsal
you’d never see me at the rehearsal.”
Her admiration for Robert Helpmann
falls, she readily admits, into the cate-
gory of unabashed hero worship. “Ever
since 1951 I’ve wanted to meet him and
although we’ve often been in the same
city together I never had the chance.
Once at a reception for Princess Margaret
I saw him and wanted to go up and say,
‘l’m an Aussie too’, but I didn’t. I was
too shy. It wasn t until I was chosen
to dance in ‘The Display’ that I finally
met him.
Without a doubt, he’s the greatest
artist to come out of Australia— and I
don’t mean only in the ballet. Whatever
field that man touches his genius shows.
I m deeply honored to be working with
him and I ve always found him a very
sympathetic person and eminently simple
in approach. But then, I think all great
artists are simple people.”

Anatomy of an Election

COMMON MARKET
By
ANTHONY SAMPSON
Author of “Anatomy of Britain”
What is the British Election really
about? At first sight, the con-
trast seems clear enough. The
two rival leaders, for the first time since
the war, have quite different, almost
opposite, personalities and backgrounds.
Gone are the days when people could
talk of Macmillan being more radical
than Gaitskell. Here, in 1964, we have
two leaders who almost seem caricatures
of their parties.
They are both men who show little
sign of a contradiction inside them, as
Gaitskell showed signs. Macmillan was
always torn between two personalities—
the radical intellectual on the one side,
and the would-be duke on the other;
and this conflict, overlaid by his style of
acting, made him a rich field of study.
Gaitskell was half a dedicated Left-wing
don, but also half a romantic who loved
glittering parties and found trade unions
a bore.
But both Sir Alec Douglas-Home and
Harold Wilson are much simpler men.
Sir Alec has never appeared as a man
who had doubts or theories about his
own position or privilege, as Macmillan
had doubts. He was not impelled into
politics, or impelled to change them, by
any intense personal experience. He
took his basic politics—as he has ex-
plained—from his ancestors, the Earls
of Durham and the Earls of Home. He
is an intelligent, perceptive and tolerant
man, but his attitudes remain primarily
those of his class —suspicious of change,
preoccupied with defence of property
and traditional values, not much inter-
ested in mass education or technological
innovation.
He has had, like any politician, to
come to terms with all kinds of changes,
and has done so without bitterness but
without foresight. When, foEinstance,
Macmillan proclaimed the “wind of
change"’ in South Africa—a wind which
Home had previously ignored—Home
quietly changed his tack, too. For he is,
above all, a loyal Conservative who will
do whatever appears to be in the party’s
interests—whether it is going with
Chamberlain to Munich, supporting
Britain’s entry to the Common Market,
or taking the job of Prime Minister.
Wilson, likewise, is a more monolithic
man than his predecessors, Gaitskell and
Attlee. His background is authentically
lower-middle class. He was born just
outside Huddersfield, one of the cradles
of the industrial revolution. His father
was a works chemist who, twice during
his son’s upbringing, found himself out
of work. And Wilson’s reminiscences
about his childhood show that he had the
kind of simple, thrifty and tough ambi-
tion which is much more characteristic
of the north of England than the south.
Although Wilson went to Oxford—like
half his shadow Cabinet —his Oxford
was a very different one from Gaitskell’s.
He kept himself apart from the fashion-
able distractions, worked immensely hard,
and came through with his northern
accent and northern austerity still intact.
This insulation has remained so that, un-
like so many of his colleagues, Wilson
appears as the quintessence of the Labor
politician—self - made, single - minded,
suspicious of the rich and smart.
This conjunction of Douglas-Home
and Wilson, then, seems satisfactorily
straightforward. Both of them embody
the traditional characteristics of their
party. Sir Alec leads the Tories from
the Right wing, Wilson leads the Social-
ists from the Left wing. No one is
likely to confuse them, or to mistake
Wilson for a Tory.
And yet, by the immutable processes
of politics, the two parties have become
confused and, as the election date grows
closer, they often seem to be speaking
each other’s language. The Conserva-
tives —ever since Disraeli coined the
phrase-—have always been masters of the
art of stealing the Opposition’s clothes,
and ever since Sir Alec was elected
leader last October this political trans-
vestism has become more marked. It
remains true that Sir Alec belongs to
the Right wing, and dislikes change, but
he knew well enough that his first task
was to win the election and olacate his
own party’s Left wing.
And so, rather more than Macmillan,
he has pushed forward the more modern-
minded members of his Cabinet, and in
particular he has given more scope to
Reginald Maudling, the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, and to Ted Heath at the
Board of Trade who, ever since he led
the negotiations over the Common Mar-
ket, has seemed to symbolise a new
British toughness.
TI/laudling and Heath—themselves bit-
■*•*■*■ ter rivals —represent the new Tory-
ism which is most likely to attract young
floating voters. They are expansionist,
cosmopolitan, liberal and un-military.
They are impatient of talk about glory
and tradition. They are not eloquent,
flamboyant or stirring, but they are both
manifestly capable and clever, and able
to master the intricacies of Britain’s
economic predicament. When people say
“the Tories know how to run things”,
they are thinking of men like Maudling


and Heath, and the new young “techno-
crats” in the managerial Ministries—
Sir Keith Joseph in Housing, Geoffrey
Rippon in Works, Sir Edward Boyle in
Education.
And Wilson, ever since his election as
Leader 18 months ago, has carefully
obliterated the image of the Left-wing
firebrand. Up till then he was known
as the old ally of Aneurin Bevan, the
critic of Gaitskell’s moderation and his
challenger from the Left. But he has
realised that to capture the electorate he
must move closer towards the Centre,
and perhaps, too, he has modified his
own views when faced with the prospect
of power. He has carefully avoided his
old friends of the Left, like Michael
Foot. He has become sedulously pro-
American, and constantly stressed his
friendships with the American Adminis-
tration. And on the issue of the inde-
pendent nuclear deterrent he has adopted
a carefully ambiguous attitude.
JThere are, of course, some issues still
outstanding on which there is a clear
clash between Tory and Labor. The
nationalisation of steel remains on the
Labor manifesto, providing embarrass-
ment to many of the Socialists, and a
useful target to the Conservatives. The
strengthening of economic planning, by
means of a new economic Ministry, is
. a central feature of Labor’s policy,
while the Conservatives —although they
have done a good deal to implement
planning in the last four years—are still
shy of any bold increase in planning
machinery. The Labor Party is com-
mitted to much bolder government in-
volvement in scientific research, and to
integrating the public (fee-paying)
schools (by unspecified means) into the
State system of education.
But, looking through the two party
manifestos, it is surprising how few
issues are cut and dried. And where the
Socialists are most definite in their in-
tentions—as with steel nationalisation
and integrating public schools—there is
some doubt about their actual enthusi-
asm.
No, the fact remains that the main
question in the election is unconnected
with issues. It is, simply, “Do you want
a change of Government?” The most
fascinating feature of these hustings is
that they mark a kind of watershed be-
tween two approaches to British politics.
The old approach implied that every elec-
tion was a battle between the forces of
conservatism and the forces of change,
or even revolution. The Conservatives
were the ruling class” —the men who,
through heredity and education, had
acquired the responsibilities and skills of
government. Against them were rebels,
VV et her Liberals or Socialists, who re-
presented in some measure the under-
dogs and the unprivileged. From time
to time —in 1906, 1923, 1929 or 1945
the old order would be upset and large
changes would be introduced. But then
the Conservatives would reorganise them-
selves, catch up with the times, and
move back.
But now the battle is more foggy. The
great old issues of unemployment, capi-
talism or colonialism have faded. The
Conservatives, after 13 years in power,
covering immense changes in Britain’s
position, have adopted a much more
flexible and ambivalent position. Their
leaders remain essentially a ruling class,
backed by antiquity, money and Eton,
but they have absorbed, more success-
fully than previously, the techniques and
attitudes of a broader world. The main
charge being made against the Tories is
not that they are wicked or rich but
that they are incompetent, and after 13
years it is time for a change. This
election, in fact, is much closer to an
American election of the pre-Goldwater
era, with two alternative parties playing
Cox and Box, attacking each other not
Sir Alec Douglos-Home
The Wilsons
so much on large moral issues as on
failures of personalities and methods.
And here the Labor Party is at a dis-
advantage. For however convincing they
may be in their assaults on Tory blun-
ders—and there has been no shortage of
blunders —it is not easy for the Socialists
to present a very impressive alternative
team. They are caught between two
kinds of party. They are half a revolu-
tionary party, with indignation and fire
left over from the bad old days of slump
and war, and half an alternative adminis-
tration, equipped with technocrats and
economists. But they are short of people
on both sides. The rugged old revolu-
tionaries—Bevin, Bevan, Cripps—have
all gone, while the new, cool master-
managers have not yet properly emerged.
The 13 years in the wilderness have left
the Labor Party with alarmingly little
experience of government. Only four
of their leaders held major posts in the
last Labor Government—Harold Wilson
was president of the Board of Trade,
Patrick Gordon Walker was Secretary of
State for Commonwealth Relations, Lord
Longford was First Lord of the Ad-
miralty, and George Brown was Minister
for Works for six months.
Most of the names in the shadow
Cabinet are hardly known to the public,
and inevitably Wilson is vulnerable to
the charge of being a “one-man band”.
When he attacks individual Tory Minis-
ters for their bungles, it is easy for the
Tories to reply: “Well, who have you
got?”
Wilson may be able to overcome this
difficulty. He would certainly recruit
some members of his Cabinet from out-
side politics: Lord Gardiner, the brilliant
barrister, would become Lord Chancel-
lor, and Lord Bowden, the dynamic boss
of the Manchester College of Techno-
logy, would probably become Minister
for Science.
In the first year of government, while
waiting for untried men to show their
form, Wilson would clearly intend to be
much more of a “one-man band” than
Sir Alec. He would centralise much
more of the government machine on

]0 Downing Street, and govern more
directly through civil servants. And in
some respects this would be an advan-
tage, giving more scope for what Wilson
calls “purposive planning”. But the fact
remains that the Labor Party, in this
pre-election time, does not give a con-
vincing picture of being able to match,
man for man, the familiar Conservative
team.
Thus it is that, after 13 turbulent years
—after the disaster of Suez, the painful
withdrawal from Africa, the fiasco of
the Common Market and the embarrass-
ments of the Profumo affair—the Con-
servatives still have high hopes of win-
ning. They are fortified by the rising
standard of living, and the national sense
of euphoria that follows a long, hot
summer.
But their biggest electoral asset is the
continuing sense that they are the people
who know how to run things, and how
to maintain prosperity. The slogan
“Don’t let Labor ruin it” is still power-
ful, and nowhere more effective than
among the working-class voters to whom
the increase in material wealth —the cars,
washing machines and holidays abroad—
has an almost magical suddenness.
“When you see all those cars on the
road,” an East End window-cleaner ex-
plained to me the other day, “you can’t
help thinking that things have got better.
Do you know where my friend took his
holiday this year? He went to Monte
Carlo! Think of that, a window-cleaner
going to Monte!” That is the measure
of the Conservative magic.
The implications of a fourth Conserva-
tive victory would be enormous, for it
would call into question not only the
two-party system but the whole structure
of Whitehall. For in Britain, as not in
America, the whole Civil Service is de-
signed as a neutral, passive instrument,
to be played on and animated by politi-
cians, and the only effective way to make
drastic changes in Whitehall is to have
a drastic change of Government.
Any party which has been long in
office accumulates a quantity of dead
wood, of old obligations and commit-
ments, which only the most ruthless
leader could cut away. In all the Con-
servative reshuffles, the same faces and
obligations have remained. When people
say “It’s time for a change”, they mean
not only a change in the Cabinet but a
change in the Civil Service, and in
sectors of industry and education. But
without an entirely new Cabinet, the
scope for such changes is surely limited.
There is thus a danger that Britain may
find herself in effect with a one-party
system, without the machinery to keep
the one party on its toes. A few high-
minded Conservatives, most notably lain
Macleod and Enoch Powell, who both
refused office under Sir Alec Douglas-
Home, take the line that the Tories
should go into opposition for a few
years, to revitalise themselves and re-
think their policies as they did between
1945 and 1951, and this notion is sup-
ported by many civil servants who would
normally be staunchly Conservative.
But this view could hardly be shared
by the engaged politicians. For them
the election, as always, is a matter of
political life or death, and to admit the
desirability of a spell out of office would
be to deny the central belief in the Con-
servatives’ right to rule.
In Britain the idea of a ruling class
dies very hard. Three months ago it
seemed as if the tide of public opinion
had set firmly against the Tories, and
that voters were determined to get rid
of them. But, then, it seems—and what
other explanation can there be of the
changing opinion polls, at a time when
nothing particular was happening—the
public, in the midst of the comfortable
summer, began to have cold feet about
the alternative. Would Wilson really
know how to handle Johnson and
Khrushchev? Would the Labor Party
be able to maintain the spending spree?
Would all those people whose names we
don t know have the strength and experi-
ence to deal with Whitehall? Shouldn’t
we keep to the devil we know?
This is what Harold Wilson is up
against. His is not an easy task. For
Britain is not in the mood for a revolu-
tionary change. It wants change, but not
upheaval. It is bored with Conservatives,
but suspicious of Socialists; and Wilson
and his colleagues are fighting not simply
a political party but a deep British faith
in a ruling class.
The floating voter, as one commenta-
tor put it, has two contradictory feelings
—a sense of cosiness and a sense of
frustration. He feels, in his bolder
moments, that the country is wasting
opportunities and living in the past. But
then he thinks about full employment,
motor cars and holidays in Monte, and
shivers on the brink. No pollster or
commentator can confidently predict the
outcome of that fearful dilemma.

“/4zi astonishing lack of elementary safeguards
the Warren Report
From GEORGE McGANN in New York
The day after the Warren Commis-
sion issued the monumental report
of its investigation into the assas-
sination of President Kennedy the Secret
Service men entrusted with the life of
President Johnson got a chilling scare
when a car filled with Press photo-
graphers burst into flames a few feet
away from the limousine carrying the
Chief Executive through the streets of
Providence, Rhode Island.
For a wild moment these guards, sev-
eral of whom were with the late President
in Dallas on November 22, 1963, be-
lieved a killer was making an attempt
on the life of John Fitzgerald Kennedy’s
successor, less than a year later.
If anything were needed to emphasise
the principal recommendation of the
Warren Commission for a complete re-
vamping of the outmoded method
of protecting the life of the President
this frightening episode certainly provided
the spur.
Luckily no one in the Providence
motorcade was injured, but fears were
aroused for the safety of Lyndon
Johnson throughout the remainder of the
political campaign. Naturally gregarious
and effusive, the President is a hard man
to restrain when he sees a large crowd
of potential Democratic voters. All
caution flies to the winds as he strides
among the mob, clutching outstretched
hands as he goes, and shouting greetings
to his admirers.
But even if Lyndon Johnson were the
most retiring, or most fearful, of Presi-
dents, the danger of assassination would
be present everywhere he went in a
country with such a long, unhappy his-
tory of violent assaults on its Presidents.
Unsuccessful attempts were made on the
lives of Andrew Jackson in 1835, former
President Theodore Roosevelt in 1921,
Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 and Harry
S. Truman in 1950.
President Abraham Lincoln was assas-
sinated in 1865, President James Gar-
field in 1881, President William Mc-
Kinley in 1901 and President Kennedy
last year.
The Warren Commission evidence dis-
closed that Kennedy had made a striking-
ly prophetic comment on the risk he was
taking in Dallas to an aide the very
morning of his death’. “If anyone really
wanted to shoot the President of the
United States it would not be a very
difficult job,” he remarked. “All one has
to do is to get in a high building some
day with a telescopic rifle and there is
nothing anybody could do to defend
against such an attempt.”
The President might have had in mind
an attempt by a man who was prepared
to die for his deed. But in the case of
his own assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald,
there was a bid for escape which nearly
succeeded. Oswald got out of the Texas
Book Repository, from which he aimed
the fatal bullets, to be captured in a
movie theatre shortly afterward.
The Commission found, therefore, that
the crime against Kennedy was a pre-
ventable one, which occurred in part
through the failure of the FBI to notify
the Secret Service of the presence in Dal-
las of Lee Harvey Oswald, a known
former defector to Russia with an en-
venomed attitude towards his own
country.
Displaying an astonishing lack of ele-
mentary safeguards, the Secret Service
also failed to search buildings along the
route or post its men on them.
The Warren Commission recommend-
ed that the President appoint a special
committee to reorganise the Secret Ser-
vice, if need be, and to take all other
action necessary to tighten up existing
loose methods of guarding the Chief
Executive. President Johnson appointed
the committee, which consisted of John
A. McCone, director of the Central In-
telligence Agency; Secretary of the Trea-
sury Douglas Dillon (the Secret Service
comes under his control); Acting Attor-
ney General Nicholas Katzenbach (the
Federal Bureau of Investigation is under
his direction); and McGeorge Bundy,
Special Assistant to the President for
national security affairs. This committee
held its first meeting shortly after the
Warren Commission findings had been
issued.
Since the Kennedy assassination there
has been improved liaison between the
FBI and the Secret Service and with
other bureaus such as the Central Intelli-
gence Agency. However, the committee
was expected to recommend tightening of
discipline within the Secret Service, some
of whose men had been in the Fort
Worth Press Club the night before the
President’s death, drinking beer and
whisky in violation of regulations.
The Warren Commission observed that
although there was no evidence that the
agents acted improperly following the
shooting, “it is conceivable that those
men who had little sleep and who had
consumed alcoholic beverages . . . might
have been more alert in the Dallas motor-
cade if they had retired promptly” the
night before the tragedy.
Commission was also highly criti-
cal of the FBI, which knew of Os-
wald's defection to Russia, his pro-Castro
activities, his trip to Mexico City, where
he contacted Soviet authorities, and of
his employment at the Texas Book Re-
pository, but failed to pass any of this
information on to the Secret Service,
which bore the primary responsibility
for guarding President Kennedy’s life.
The Commission’s report, 10 months
in preparation, and produced by a non-
partisan group of distinguished citizens
(seven Republicans and five Democrats)
headed by the Chief Justice of the United
States, Earl Warren, became an im-
mediate best-seller. Paper-back copies of

187 private citizens supervise the Mobil Economy Run
On 20th October next this small army of inde-
pendent observers and officials will start a 4-day
■figil to ensure that you get a true report of what
your make of car can do on a really modern petrol.
These are impartial private citizens chosen at random
from many different fields. Under the Run Director
(who is appointed with the approval of the Con-
federation of Australian Motor Sport and is answer-
able only to it), they enforce the regulations of the
Run’s 40-page rule book. They see that drivers obey
traffic laws, drive safely, stick to the route and that
no one tampers with officially sealed parts of their
ears. As well as these 187 officials, many independent
news reporters, television and radio commentators,
md motoring editors accompany the Run cars.

Eight Australian Economy Runs and many more overseas
have given Mobil a big lead in petrol economy knowledge.
It led to the discovery that cylinders farthest from the
carburettor are power-starved by ordinary petrols, and
serious waste occurs. So Mobil developed TETRAMEL,
the additive that distributes power evenly to all cylinders.

were grabbed up by a public eager for
every detail of the crime of the century.
The unanimous report contained no
surprises. It confirmed prior intimations
that the Commission had found the 24-
year-old Lee Harvey Oswald had acted
alone, without any conspirators at home
or abroad, in murdering President Ken-
nedy, and that Oswald’s killer, night-club
owner Jack Ruby, had also acted alone
and also without fellow-plotters.
It described Oswald as a man haunted
by “isolation, frustration and failure”,
who had “deep-rooted resentment of all
authority and a hostility toward every
society in which he lived”. The Commis-
sion found that Oswald had done only
one thing well in his entire life his
assassination of the President.
The Commission took evidence from
an eye-witness who had seen Oswald
shoot the President from the window of
the Book Repository, and two more eye-
witnesses who had seen him shoot a Dal-
las policeman an hour later. The Com-
mission ordered the FBI to re-enact the
shooting on the site. It ordered ex-
haustive tests to be made of simulated
human heads, filled with animal tissue,
to trace the course of a high-powered
bullet as it strikes a skull. It investigated
in incredible detail every myth, rumor
and bit of gossip concerning an alleged
conspiracy, and sought to answer every
question raised abroad and at home con-
cerning the killing.
The Commission’s refusal during its
long investigation to make public any
of its findings, while understandable,
nevertheless helped the spread of the
myths which have circulated, principally
in Europe, about a link between Os-
wald and Ruby and their shadowy co-
conspirators. Europe, with its long his-
tory of conspiratorial assassination, not-
ably the plot that set off World War I
at Sarajevo, seized upon every Press re-
port lending credence to the notion that
Oswald was acting on behalf of others.
nPHE fictional volume, “Who Killed Ken-
nedy?” by former American Com-
munist Thomas Buchanan, led many
people abroad to believe Kennedy died
as a result of a Rightist plot. But many
followers of General Edward Walker and
similar lunatic fringe elements in America
have been just as certain that Oswald
was a paid Soviet agent. The Warren
Commission report disposes of both
theories as absurdities.
The myths were also assisted by faulty
reporting by newspapermen on the spot
in Dallas and by the misleading state-
ments of police and other authorities in
the confusion of the killings of the Presi-
dent and of his assassin.
The Commission report disposed of
one of the most popular myths, that the
President was killed by a bullet which
struck him in the throat and was fired
from in front of his limousine from a
highway overpass, and not by bullets
from the repository building behind him.
The shots definitely came from behind
and from the 6.5 millimetre Mannlicher-
Caracano rifle found on the sixth floor
of the building, “to the exclusion of all
other weapons”, the report stated.
That rifle had been purchased by
Oswald from a Chicago mail-order house.
The Commission determined that three
shots had been fired at the President,
and the three used cartridge cases were
found near the sixth-floor window. The
windscreen of the President’s car had
been struck by a bullet fragment on the
inside of the glass—not on the outside
by a bullet entering from ahead of the
car, as the myths had it.
The Commission found that Kennedy
was struck first by a bullet which entered
the back of his neck and exited through
the lower front portion of his neck,
“causing a wound not necessarily lethal”.
However, he was struck a second time
by a bullet entering the right-rear por-
tion of his head, “causing a massive and
lethal wound”. Governor Connelly of
Texas, riding in the seat ahead of the
President, was struck by a third bullet.
The Commission employed the latest
nucleonic methods in identifying Os-
wald’s fingerprints on the murder gun.
It obtained an unmistakable palm print
near the firing end of the barrel, proving
that Oswald “had handled the rifle when
it was disassembled”. In addition, labora-
tory tests identified a tuft of dark-blue
and orange-yellow fibres on the weapon
as coming from a shirt of the same hues
as worn by Oswald on the day of the
murder.
When seen by a fellow worker carry-
ing the rifle, inside wrapping paper, into
the repository, Oswald explained he had
bought curtain rods for his apartment in
Dallas. The Commission turned up a 45-
year-old steam-fitter, Howard L. Bren-
nan, who had been sitting on a concrete
wall opposite the repository, 150 feet
away, and who clearly saw Oswald fire
the rifle from the window. Brennan that
night identified Oswald in a police line-
up.
The Commission supervised tests
which determined that a marksman of
Oswald’s capabilities (he was a former
Marine) could easily have fired the shots
at a moving target in the elapsed time.
Oswald’s earlier attempt on the life of
General Walker (known to his wife but
no one else) demonstrated his willingness
to commit murder, the Commission
noted.
“On the basis of these findings,” the
report stated, “the Commission has con-
cluded that Lee Harvey Oswald was the
assassin of President Kennedy.”
The Commission went to great lengths
in disposing of rumor and speculation
concerning plots linking Oswald and
Ruby with each other or with others.
It was unable to find “credible evidence”
that Ruby and Oswald had ever met or
were linked through others. It noted
published accounts that Oswald looked
directly at Ruby just before he was shot
and apparently recognised him, but re-
ported that examination of television
tapes and motion picture films of the
shooting failed to disclose such a facial
expression.
TLhe Commission also took note of a
A news story in the Munich weekly,
“Deutsche National Zeitung”, alleging
that Dallas police had intended to arrest
both Oswald and Ruby for the attack
on General Walker but were prevented
from doing so by the FBI, acting at the
behest of Attorney - General Robert
Kennedy. This story, the Commission
found, was fabricated by an editor of
the paper.
The Commission report was im-
mediately labelled a “whitewash” by
Leftist commentators in Europe and
condemned by General Walker in this
country. Most Americans and foreign
observers in this country have received
it as a conscientious, painstaking docu-
ment, indicating beyond reasonable doubt
the sole guilt of Oswald.

The Barbarian
Revolution?
After the Westbrook
ivcitershed
From MAURICE SHADBOLT in
Auckland
When Eric Westbrook came over
from Melbourne to open the
Auckland Arts Festival this
year he called for a revival of the
“Anzac spirit” in the arts. As one of
the few men familiar with what is hap-
pening on both sides of the Tasman,
he was well qualified to speak.
Certainly in the arts, the growth of
national culture, New Zealand has no
longer much to fear from comparison
with Australia. (Perhaps only in theatre
—there is still no professional theatre,
and little native drama—does New Zea-
land fare badly.) This certainly wasn’t
the case thirty, twenty or even ten years
ago—which indicates how recent and
spectacular growth has been here. I
don’t mean the phoney proliferation of
State-subsidised opera and ballet com-
panies; the interpretative arts have
always been an easy mark for a country
which wants to buy culture on the cheap.
There is still no New Zealand opera, no
New Zealand ballet; and, for all the
good work of the National Orchestra
(recently and curiously re-named the
NZBC Symphony Orchestra”) over the
ast twenty years, there are still only
two or three New Zealand composers—
'he Douglas Lilburn and David Far-
quhar whose work can be heard with
interest.
The real growth has been in the
v 'sual arts and literature, fields in which
there has been relatively little or no
subsidy for the serious and really imagi-
native worker.
Significant art here was an affair of
isolated and often desperately lonely
figures twenty years ago—of painters
like Toss Wollaston on the bleak west
coast of the South Island, Eric Lee-
Johnson in the ramshackle and sub-
tropical region of Northland, pains-
takingly examining the face of the land;
or of John Weeks in Auckland, with
his tentative forays into urban New
Zealand.
Probably the watershed was the
appointment of Eric Westbrook as direc-
tor of the Auckland Art Gallery in the
early 19505. He turned a rather sad,
Victorian museum into an exciting
centre —he brought in interesting exhi-
bitions from outside, and found an im-
mediate response inside the country; he
also hung the work of modern New
Zealand artists. By the time he left the
country to take up his Melbourne
appointment, Auckland was well on the
way to becoming a coherent centre for
the art world of the country. Such
artists as Colin McCahon —the most
powerful and certainly the most central
New Zealand painter—had taken up
residence in the fcity. Attracted to Auck-
land are young artists like Patrick Hanly
who, after modest success in Europe,
could well have stayed away the rest of
their lives; and young artists from less
receptive southern centres who might
otherwise have become permanent
exports.
There is a youthful vitality in the visu-
al arts now which makes even New Zea-
land writing look rather elderly and
lethargic. Recent exhibitions have re-
vealed some extraordinarily diverse
talent; the “international style” is pro-
bably less in evidence now than it was,
say, immediately after the Westbrook
revolution. McCahon may wander fitfully
into abstraction, but he returns again and
again in his work to the hard hills and
waterfalls of New Zealand; Hanly may
endeavor to abstract the elements of
Antipodean myth—rock and bush, sea
and sky—but he also brings a shrewd
eye to human figures arrayed in the light
of a burning Auckland summer. Robert
Ellis, with his semi-abstract God-eye
views of New Zealand cities, is almost
as interesting. Young figurative artists
such as Don Binney, Susan Goldberg
and Gretchen Albrecht push hard behind
them. Notable is the development of
a number of Maori artists —Selwyn Muru
and Ralph Hotere, to name the two
most prominent—who with at least a
racial memory of a thousand years of
remarkable achievement in the visual
arts behind them have little that is naive
in their work; in sophistication they are
a world away from their Australian
Aborigine counterparts. All these people
are resident or chiefly resident in Auck-
land; outside the city there are the usual
lonely figures, just as there were twenty
years ago—Freda Simmonds in the
desert sands of Northland, Paul Olds
working upon the lonely valleys of the
mid-South Island.
Perhaps inevitably sculptors have
lagged behind; but as a recent and
striking exhibition of athletic figures by
24-year-old Greer Twiss shows, they will
probably not lag behind for long. Twiss,
following the old tradition, is at present
packing his bags for London, but he
departs from precedent in that he plans
to return after a year. After all, he has
no reason not to return: at his un-
heralded first exhibition he sold more
than £SOO worth of sculpture. It
wouldn’t be bad for a young man any-
where.
Expatriation has often been used—•
sometimes unreliably—as a barometer to
measure the creative climate in Austra-
lia and New Zealand, and it is certainly
true that writers here no longer go away
to stay away; there are no more than
two or three New Zealand writers now
resident outside the country—and one,
Dan Davin, has lived in England since
the 19305. Expatriation is no longer a
real issue, and perhaps has not been
since the war. Novelist Janet Frame,
the most recent to return, is quite cer-
tain about it all. The overworked
theme of journeys to and from New
Zealand, and the question of whether a
writer goes or stays should, she says, be
cast out of imaginative literature into
sociology “to be worried like an old
bone”.
1958 the crucial year
VTot that the home growth has all been
healthy. There was a certain
clubbiness, a hothouse atmosphere
about New Zealand writing up to the
late 19505. True, there was much
of value in the work of those
writers mainly poets who made
themselves felt during and after the
19305. But a lot of rank, pale weeds
also thrived in the artificial atmosphere
with large shots of critical manure to
help along.
Probably 1958 was the crucial year—
when lan Cross with his short novel
“The God Boy” and Sylvia Ashton-
Warner with her “Spinster” let in some
fresh air. Other writers —almost all
from outside the established literary
coteries—followed in quick succession
from English and American publishers.
Since then, some overblown hothouse
reputations have shrivelled to size; others
have withered beyond recall.
Perhaps the most significant change
is in the attitude of the younger writers
towards both their country and New
Zealand society. It is probably fair to
say that modern New Zealand writing

was created, by and large, by men with
a distaste for the colonial crudity of the
society they happened to be born in;
with the exception of the expansive and
vigorous poet A. R. D. Fairburn, who
died in 1957, their protestations of
affection for the country were always
strained and unconvincing.
The rise in the early 1950 s of an
“internationalist'’ group of poets in
Wellington, taking issue with such fer-
vent and dubious nationalists as poet-
anthologist Allen Curnow, in no way
really changed things; the two groups
belonged to reverse sides of the same
coin. New Zealand was seen as a grey,
Philistine land in which the artist was
tentatively and precariously entrenched.
The issue was still Aesthetes versus
Bruisers. Poetry—with its capacity for
rhetorical statement —might thrive fit-
fully on this, but a rejection of crudity
meant a lamentable lack of vitality in
prose. Fiction tended to be more and
more peripheral in its preoccupations.
What distinguishes the work of young-
er writers like lan Cross from their pre-
decessors is their easy-going acceptance
of the physical side of life in New Zea-
land: the New Zealand of the Rugby
field, of the weekend fisherman and deer-
stalker. They accept their country for
what it is, even if they demand that it be
something more. For younger writers
are by no means uncritical of New
Zealand society. In fact, it was lan
Cross who gave us in “After Anzac
Day” (1961), the most central New Zea-
land novel in years, a thorough and
exciting critical exploration of the coun-
try as a welfare State.
Outside his craftsmanlike fiction,
Cross has argued that “instead of being
an altogether admirable facet of our
national character, welfarism is all we
have by way of a national character. It
is not an adequate achievement for a
nation at this point in human history,
Our fathers and grandfathers belonged
to exhausted generations. They made a
bed of comfortable social legislation and
went to sleep . . . Welfare State Vic-
torianism refuses to recognise the fact of
our destiny—that we must sooner or
later become barbarians, crude, exuber-
ant, driving and iconoclastic, because we
are, however distasteful the fact, the
citizens of a raw new world. (We live
in) a community that can be saved only
by barbarians".
Post-nationalist doldrums
young writers have been almost
as central. Noel Hilliard's novel
“Maori Girl” (1960) was the first study
of the urban Maori; he has followed it
up with some impressive stories on
Maori themes. Maurice Gee’s “The
Big Season” (1962) was an effective
dramatisation of a small, Rugby-mad
New Zealand town; his longest, and
best, short story “The Losers” brought
horse-racing and its hangers-on into
New Zealand fiction for the first
time. Up to a dozen young writ-
ers as interesting could be named; the
fact that they can be, indicates at least
the breadth of recent growth. And a
novelist like Janet Frame, whose continu-
ing concern for the rejects of society is
apparent in her most recent book “Scent-
ed Gardens for the Blind” (1963), writes
with considerably more depth and virtu-
osity than her predecessors in the 1930 s
and 1940 s
As might be expected in a small
country, some hothouse reputations are
still carefully tended and manured, but
there are few blooms. There was an
interesting instance of this kind of thing
last year when a thick volume (nearly
500 closely-printed pages) of drab, em-
bittered and amateurish sociology by an
Auckland University lecturer was hailed
as a major New Zealand novel. I have
yet to meet someone, not a friend of the
author, who read the book; or who,
having read it, liked it.
There has been little real development
in poetry. Young poets tend either to
ape their elders, or pull faces at their
elders: neither stance has had much
point. Significantly, the best of the
younger poets like English immigrant
Peter Bland have social rather than
nationalistic concerns. For Bland and
others, the problem is how to accept sub-
urbia and yet retain human individuality’
And for Fleur Adcock, perhaps the most
considerable of them all her volume
“The Eye of the Hurricane” (1964) is the
best first book of verse in many years

A mike so light,
you forget you’ve got it on!
Philips neck microphone is the first
truly compact light-weight mike for
store demonstrations. Comfortable
to wear, it adjusts easily, projects
your voice clearly to the back of
any room, and stays in place no
matter how much you move about.
Philips neck microphone can be
used with any portable public
address system, too. However, best
results are achieved with Philips
Public Address Units. Like the
mains-operated 928 C model. Or the
battery-powered EV4651 model
illustrated. This latter unit lets you
set up demonstrations right
where your customers are,
without the restriction of
being near a power-point.

eW Zealand is simply an admirable set-
tjng for the sex war. It's hard to say it,
but it’s true: Poetry seems to have done
its major l ob bere i no longer matters
ver y much. It could be just post-national-
ist doldrums inevitable in all new litera-
tures. Poets like Fairburn, Curnow and
penis Glover made New Zealand a vivid
presence in literature; only James K.
Baxter, of the late-comers, has taken a
second and critical look at the territory
which they won. The interesting work
of Maori poet Hone Tuwhare indicates
that the same territory may yet be seen
again in rather different terms.
Without any literary magazine of dis-
tinction, the country has little or nothing
in the way of criticism; the once promis-
ing South Island journal “Landfall” has
grown more and more remote, not only
from New Zealand life, but also from
what is being written here. Few new
writers contribute to it; even fewer read
it.
The rise of fresh voices, plus import
restrictions imposed on books for a few
years after 1958, has meant a certain
boom in local publishing though the
sad fact is that most new writers had to
go to English and American publishers
in the first place. The most impressive
publishing success has been that of Barry
Crump, a sort of latter-day Kiwi mix-
ture of Mark Twain and Henry Lawson,
whose four books have sold locally some-
thing around 150,000 copies enough
to set any publisher on his feet.
But perhaps the most lasting contri-
bution to the development of national
consciousness has been made by scholars
and historians who have miraculously
retrieved our past, and found it meaning-
ful for the present. Essayists like E. H.
McCormick and historians like Keith
Sinclair (another historian-poet) have
stripped myth from the past and given
us honest perspective on our triumphs
and tragedies which we must have if
w e are to know ourselves as New Zea-
landers. Among the things which Sin-
clair has considered with candor are
the massive and ruthless confiscations of
Maori land in the last century; and the
Maori wars themselves.
Does this confused picture add to
something larger? In a much-quoted
Poem, Allen Curnow speculates on the
skeleton of that giant but extinct bird,
the moa, which once roamed New Zea-
an<f; and he expresses the hope that

MR BORG'S AUCTION IN SE2
T'o be frank there is nothing that
A Toorak adores more than a
quality auction, and we have just
enjoyed some particularly vintage
auction years. However, there was
an affair last week which must rank
as the finest for 1964 Mr Ray-
mond Borg’s auction in Yarradale
Road, at the heart of SE2.
The board outside mentioned
“luxurious furnishings, French and
Chinese furnishings, china, minia-
tures, books, seven television sets,
Bluthner grand piano, Ming bronzes,
billiard table, etc.”
It was all thrown open to view at
9.30 a.m. on the Saturday. There
was no parking within quarter of a
mile, the crowds poured in. The living
room of Mr Borg’s house was like the
Lawn at Flemington on Cup Day,
everybody one knew was there. They
were fiddling with the Chien-lung
porcelain bowls, going through the
cocktail decanters in the bar and most
of all they liked to swing in Mr
Borg’s “luxurious green hide uphol-
stered swivel and tilt executive chair.”
Your correspondent immediately
set out to discover the seven TV sets.
There was one in the Oriental Ball-
room, discreetly hidden with its twin
speakers, in an enormous custom-built
Chinese cabinet. There was another
in the billiard room, another in the
games room, and all the others were
in bedrooms. The number one bed-
room was nice. There was the mirror
which covered all one wall. There
was the TV in one corner and on the
other side was the large double bed.
The bedside tables provided space for
the telephone, the remote control TV
unit and the inter-com, which had
switches, for the maid, kitchen, bar
and other bedrooms. And, oh yes,
there was the air-conditioning unit.
The sightseers though spent most
time in the Oriental Ballroom and
this was gorgeous. One side was all
glass which looked out into a Japan-
ese garden complete with pool,
bronze ibis, bronze elephants and
plastic water lilies.
There were vases, heavens how
there were vases! Ming vases, clois-
onne vases, Chien-lung vases, Kang-
hsi vases, and one enormous Chinese
vase which was 7ft 6ins high. Down
one end, on top of the Chinese TV
arrangement, were two Ming Buddhist
temple figures, 32 inches high.
Actually the Buddhas were not treat-
ed with quite the dignity they
deserved. One gentleman irreverently
poked a Buddha in its bronze
stomach and said: “Ming? If that’s
Ming then I’m flaming Mao Tse-
tung.”
If the Buddhas were what Robin
Boyd would call the “featurism” for
one end. then the “featurism” for the
other end was a marble-topped bar
lined with Venetian glass goblets, a
lacquered wine vat, a pair of bongo
drums and the odd musical decanter.
So much for the scene. The auc-
tion started in the main drawing room
at 10.30 a.m. on the Monday. It was
so crowded, at first we felt there was
really no room for Mr Graham Joel,
the auctioneer. However, he was in
good form and things went well. The
Boudoir Bluthner grand piano fetched
£5OO, a Sevres ormolu clock brought
£3lO and a Louis XIV centre table
£l9O.
The same old Toorak crowd was
there and the din was appalling.
Time and again poor Mr Joel appeal-
ed for quiet. To one woman he said:
“Madam, I would advise you not to
wave to your friends. You very nearly
went home with a Round Kaga China
Wall Plaque.”
T>ut the real figure at the auction
was Mr Emanuel Margolin. One
time Mr Margolin, a used car
dealer, was well on his way to becom-
ing a youthful millionaire. He suffer-
ed badly during the credit squeeze and
had to sell all at a similar auction
in March, 1963. One of the star
bidders at the auction was nobody
else but Mr Raymond Borg. Since
that day Mr Margolin has come good
again and he was buying back all his
possessions. As he commented: “Too-
rak is a very small place.”
The understanding between Mr
Joel and Mr Margolin was superb.
Only an old auction enthusiast could
tell that Margolin was bidding at all.
He didn’t twitch an ear, he didn’t
nod, he just looked and every time
the score went up another £lO he
dropped his eyelids. And so he
bought back his “magnificent pair of
Sevres porcelain vases” for £BO each,
his “glorious Louis XVI three section-
al salon cabinet” for £350, his panoply
of Toledo swords for £65, and so on.
Then came Lot 130, an unbeliev-
able thing, a great stuffed wedge-
tailed eagle with a stuffed rabbit in
its talons, all on a stand. Suddenly I
remembered the Margolin sale; clear-
ly it was the same eagle. At the time
it went for £2B and Mr Joel said to
the buyer: “I hope you have a car, sir.
You’re going to look awfully funny
taking it home in the tram.”
Graham Joel looked straight at Em-
anueL “Aw, come on. Come on,
aren’t you going to bid?” So Eman-
uel bid and for £9 his old eagle came
home to roost. But if the truth is
known he wasn’t awfully keen. The
eagle was looking a little tired, and,
besides, he had since bought two
better eagles.
The auction continued, miniatures,
aboriginal weapons, plastic indoor
plants, Samurai swords, a 1962 Ency-
clopaedia Britannica bound in white
calf brought £l7O, the championship
billiard table in figured fiddle-back
blackwood was worth £250. Those
Ming Buddhas were disappointing,
they brought only £l2O and £lOO and
the “Pioneer stereophonic multi-tun-
ing hi-fi radio with Philips 4-speed
record player with two speakers plus
Grundig T.K.64 tape recorder” might
have gathered more than a total £215,
but there it was. One of the last items
to go was the burglar alarm, a steal
at £27/10/0.
The house already had been sold
for a reported £31,000, and the total
for this day’s sale was just on
£lO,OOO. Mr Joel was very happy,
because as he put it “all the items
were not everybody’s cup of tea.” In-
deed he had good cause to be happy;
after all, before many financial moons
roll by, we should see more such
auctions in SE2.

Lunch without Prejudice
“Come again , Mr Leibler ”
By D. J. KILLEN, MP
The sheer mischief of Mr Isi Leib-
ler’s views “ ‘Anti-Semitic’ Unity
Tickets” (The Bulletin, Septem-
ber 26) calls for an answer.
When I first read what Mr Leibler
offered by way of serious comment, I
was angry. I resented his impertinence,
and the way in which he let prejudice
and malice blind him to truth and to the
qualities of fair play.
A day or so has moderated my feel-
ings. Now I remind myself that Mr
Leibler and I are “. . . fed with the
same food, hurt with the same weapons,
subject to the same diseases, healed by
the same means, warmed and cooled by
the same winter and summer . . .” This
change of mind may be enfeebled charity.
But, then, my conviction has it that
charity is a great virtue, and I try to
practise it, however imperfectly.
The curiosity which oozes from Mr
Leibler can, I believe, be settled. The
same settlement may also serve the
malevolence which lurks in other quart-
ers. I have not got, as implied by Mr
Leibler, any sinister association with the
Australian League of Rights, or with its
Director, Mr E. D. Butler. On two
occasions I have given papers to the
League, one on Communism, the other
on The Commonwealth. If Mr Leibler
has any genuine interest in these two
matters I would, if invited, give similar
papers to an audience provided by him.
Two years ago the League asked me to
go to the United Kingdom to speak on
the Common Market. People from all
walks of life and from every political
party, other than the Communist Party,
subscribed to make my visit possible.
It was, and still is, a deeply held view
of mine that if Britain went into the
European Economic Community, that
would be the end of the Commonwealth.
I do not apologise to Mr Leibler, or to
anybody on the face of the earth for my
stand.
Most of the meetings I addressed in
Britain were organised by the Common-
wealth Industries Association, and a for-
mer President of the Association, Lord
Balfour, wrote an introduction to my
'ln the Commonwealth Cause”. It may
also be of interest to Mr Leibler to hear
that I shared platforms with a sweep of
political opinion that ran from Mrs
Barbara Castle to the Earl of Sandwich.
At no time have I felt under any
obligation to the Australian League of
Rights, and neither has the League
sought to place me under any obligation.
One is left to wonder if by chance Mr
Leibler asked me to address any orga-
nisation he is associated with, whether
or not I would be placed under some
liability.
I speak to many organisations. I am
not a member of any political organi-
sation other than the Liberal Party, and
I repudiate any impeachment by Mr
Leibler that I first consult him before
addressing any meeting, whether it be on
the banks of the Barcoo, or in West-
minster Hall.
Mr Leibler's cynical reference to the
smears directed against me will not com-
mend itself to anybody interested in
justice. But justice has never, I feel,
been a passion with Mr Leibler. One
day in August, 1960, Mr Leibler had
lunch at Parliament House with
W. C. Wentworth and me. It was, as
I recall it, an amiable lunch. Before he
left, Mr Leibler asked me for a state-
ment denouncing Mr E. D. Butler, say-
ing “it would greatly help him”. The
justice of that proposal seemed to me to
be “. . . wolfish, bloody, starved and
ravenous”. I rejected it.
However, my reluctance to comply
did not seem to upset Mr Leibler. He
wrote to me on August 31, 1960, in quite
affectionate terms, his letter concluding
“Kindest regards to yourself and Mr
Wentworth”.
Mr Leibler's creaking condescension
in pointing out that I deny “any anti-
Semitic prejudices” would be hard to
surpass. The truth is, of course, that I
have no prejudice whatsoever as regards
color, creed or race. My quarrel is with
those philosophies which seek to shrink
the human spirit and destroy the great
estate of freedom.
My stand is simple. I refuse to put
humanity into compartments, and I will
strive to condemn the utter cruelty that
marked the massacre of Arab men,
women and children at Deir Yasin as
swiftly as I condemn the predation of
President Nasser.
Finally, let Mr Leibler be clear on two
things. Firstly, he is always welcome to
come to lunch again. Secondly, if I
believe a cause is right, I will defend it,
and no threat or promise of favor will
silence me.


Letters to the Editor
Melbourne University
SIR. —Melbourne University simply
cannot produce graduates of a proper
standard when it is given a shoestring
budget on which to finance all of its
many activities. Your correspondent
(19/9/64) put forward some of the more
alarming statistics which emphasise the
unfair treatment of this university, both
when compared with other Australian
universities and, more importantly, hav-
ing regard to its own need for financial
assistance in order to fulfil what the uni-
versity considers to be its duty to the
community.
The governments of the State of Vic-
toria and of the Commonwealth must
provide the finance which the university
requires to meet its crying needs, and not
simply what the governments consider
they can afford. Experience has shown
that if the governments are left to deter-
mine how much they believe they can
spare, then the university will be obliged
to continue providing tutorials in which
classes are too large for effective work,
and be unable to remedy the inadequate
literary facilities and to increase the num-
ber of academic staff.
It is surely an alarming state of affairs
when the president of the Staff Associa-
tion, Prof. P. Brett, feels himself obliged
to appeal directly to the people for the
finance which it is the duty of the Execu-
tive to provide.

Helping the Aborigines
SIR. —While a great deal has been spo-
ken over the past month about Aboriginal
problems, my organisation has been set-
ting forth on various definite projects to
help overcome these problems. I am the
chairman of the Social Work Committee,
which is made up of leading Sydney
social workers and also lecturers in social
studies at Sydney University. This com-
mittee has begun steps to find Sydney’s
first Aboriginal social worker. We have
commenced looking for this Aboriginal
throughout Australia, to work full time
from our Centre at 810 George Street,
Sydney. We hope that this person will
commence duties before the end of the
year, and if we cannot find one with
complete qualifications we are prepared
to complete his or her training so that we
will have in the field an active, fully
qualified, full-time Aboriginal who can
best deal with Aboriginal problems.
My committee has also begun re-
cruiting Aboriginal volunteers to be train-
ed as couriers. These couriers will act as
a pipeline between the Centre and the
Aboriginal communities, where many
people are too shy to come forward
to take advantage of the social welfare
facilities available in Sydney. These couri-
ers will go to these communities and ex-
plain, and, if necessary, lead backward
families to these facilities so that they
may enjoy the same advantages available
to the remainder of the community. As
part of this plan we have commenced
plans to establish an Aboriginal Informa-
tion Service at the Centre, manned by
Aboriginal people.
Our immediate plan is to help Sydney’s
Aboriginal people and also those country
people who keep coming to Sydney in
search of work and accommodation. As
the Centre’s activities expand, we hope
this work will extend to other areas of
the State and, possibly, even the Com-
monwealth.
I would like to stress that the Founda-
tion itself does not propose to take over
the work of existing Government and
community organisations, but merely to
supplement this work and to try to fill
the gaps when they occur.

Sex and the Romans
SIR. —Alex Carey (19/9/64) quotes a
denial of the connection between the
decay of the Roman Empire and sexual
indulgence. He should read “Sexual
Relations and Human Behavior” by
Dr J. D. Unwin, MC, PhD (Cantab.).
Dr Unwin surveys 80 civilisations. Sum-
marising his findings he writes: —
“Sometimes a man has been heard to
declare that he wishes both to enjoy the
advantages of high culture and to abo-
lish compulsory continence. The in-
herent nature of the human organism,
however, seems to be such that these
desires are incompatible, even contra-
dictory . . . any human society is free
to choose either to display great energy
or to enjoy sexual freedom; the evidence
is that it cannot do both for more than
one generation.”
Livy ascribed the moral decline in
Rome “to our present age, when we can
endure neither our vices nor their
remedies.”
T. H. UREN
Melbourne {Vic.).
SIR.—Mr Alex Carey’s letter is rather
obscure, even when the irrelevancies
about the Roman Empire, etc., are left
aside. As far as I can make out, he
seems to be questioning whether there is
any evidence that the type of sexual
“ethic” advocated by Professor May
(15/8/64) “would have damaging rather
than beneficial social and individual con-
sequences”. Does Mr Carey wish to
suggest that such measures as having
schoolboys discuss the (supposed) “homo-
sexual agony” of some of Shakespeare’s
characters could have beneficial conse-
quences to the individual and to society?
R. M. GASCOIGNB
Wahroonga {NSW).
Academics and the Law
SlR.—William a’Beckett’s urgency
(26/9/64) is quite uncalled for. Since
at least the time of the French Revolu-
tion it has been postulated by the people
that both the laws of a country and
the constitutions under which they are
made may be changed. This, however,
is no reason why the completely medieval
concept of “benefit of clergy” should
now be resurrected with respect to
academics.
Should this ever be admitted as a
general concept, then the people would
have no alternative than to have recourse
to a most careful scrutiny of the vintage
year of each degree, doctorate or what
have you. Very obviously a degree
issued say in 1964 would have to rate
above that gained in the equivalent dis-
cipline in 1936, perhaps above that
gained in 1963 if the analogy is carried
to the nth degree.
How absurd can you get?
EDWARD WRIGHT
Glenbrook {NSW).
SIR. William a’Beckett made the
statement that “a university is no normal
master and an academic no normal
servant”. The sooner Mr a’Beckett
realises that this is sheer nonsense the
better. The master-servant relationhip
does not change whether it involves
universities or council garbage con-
tractors. Why should it?
C. F. MACDONALD

The Heritage Bookshop
SIR.—As chairman of the board of direc-
tors' of New Times Ltd, of which the
Heritage Bookshop is an associate enter-
prise, may I protest in the strongest
possible language against Mr Isi Lei-
bler’s statement that this bookshop,
falsely described as Mr Butler’s, “is the
central distributing agency for some of
the vilest racialist and anti-Semitic litera-
ture in Australia”.
Following complaints by Mr Leibler
early this year, a Melbourne “Herald”
reporter visited the Heritage Bookshop
and made a diligent search, but in an
attempted smear in the “Herald” of
April 29 could only muster two titles:
“Facts Are Facts” and “Fraudulent
Conversion”. The “Herald” writer did
not mention that the author of “Facts
Are Facts” is a well known American
Jew, Bergman Freedman. I make no
apologies concerning Jordan’s book. A
very small stock of this book was ob-
tained long before Colin Jordan became
a National Socialist, and the “Herald”
representative discovered what turned
out to be the last copy.
Following the “Herald’s” free pub-
licity—or perhaps we should thank Mr
Leibler? a large number of people

came into the bookshop, most of them
apparently expecting to see a shop
stocked full of terrible anti-Semitic
literature. Instead they found many
books by Christian philosophers dealing
with the subject of Communism and the
challenge of Marxian-Leninism to the
Western Christian civilisation. Many ex-
pressed surprise that a large number of
books stocked in the bookshop are by
Jewish authors, themselves concerned
with Communism as the prime menace
to peace in the world.
It is probably true that from time to
time we have stocked books which Mr
Leibler objects to, but like all book-
sellers the Heritage Bookshop does not
endorse all the views expressed by the
authors of the books sold. If Mr Leibler
has made an honest investigation of the
activities of the bookshop he knows that
it caters primarily for political and
economics students, that its shop’s big-
gest sales are of books which deal with
international Communism.

Radio Amateurs
SIR. — I have been a subscriber to The
Bulletin for about a year, my copy
coming by surface transport and arriving
a bit late. I noted in reading the July 11
issue, in the article entitled “The Gold-
water Convention”, that Mr George Mc-
Cann describes amateur radio as “his un-
sophisticated hobby”, referring of course
to the fact that Senator Goldwater is
a radio amateur.
Now I must suggest that if unsophisti-
cation exists, it unfortunately exists in
the mind of Mr McGann. I do think
I know the meaning and proper use of
the word “sophistication” and I suspect
that more than a few of your Australian
readers, as well as your American read-
ers, do also. If electronic short-wave
communication is unsophisticated, then I
am sure nuclear physics is also. Your
Australian amateurs, of whom there are
more than just a few, must have read
the statement with amazement. The state-
ment is utterly asinine. I will not bother
myself to include even an abbreviated
listing of the major contributions to
electronic communications made by radio
amateurs.

readers could help me in finding any
letters, manuscripts or personal docu-
ments relating to him.

REVIEWS
ART
God in the House of Mammon
By JOHN HENSHAW
The Blake Prize, 1964, Commonwealth
Savings Bank, Martin Place, Syd-
ney.
VTo one would think that painting or
any other of the visual arts is out of
place in a bank—it only depends on the
kind and quality. Sizes, too, must be
related to the areas available and here
the paintings, quite big in most cases, are
cramped. However, despite the goodwill
on the part of bank officials and the
organisers of the Blake, few people would
feel happy to contemplate religious art
in these surroundings. One second look
may console the purists when they see a
lot of modern paintings with religious-
sounding titles, but in fact portraying
little of the kind.
The catalogue reveals a change of
attitude on the side of the clerics—“ab-
stractionism is particularly suited to ex-
press the profound mysteries of religion
in such a time as this”. This is indeed
new, even though for years most have
believed the opposite and can bring sub-
stantial historical evidence to help their
argument. Where these artists can usu-
ally gain entrance to the religions is
through symbolism, on which there seems
little agreement among the clergy.
Through symbolism some contemplative
focus is produced; without symbolism
only recognisable images appear to be
acceptable.
In the 1964 Blake we have a few
attempting much and many who do not.
The standards are not as high as in some
previous years, nor is there any one work
which really achieves great distinction as
a religious painting. The winner, Michael
Kitching, displays his skill at assemblage
in quite an attractive work which has only
a remote connection with a religious
subject. It scarcely deserved the prize.
Roger Kemp exhibits two solid works
entitled “Ascension” and “Genesis”.
Kemp is an artist who commands our
respect because over many years he has
tried to come to terms with serious and
important themes dealing with humanity.
His technique is related to cubism which
gives his paintings a firm structure.
Ken Reinhard’s pop pyramid of
decorative trivialities underlines the fact
that materialism can’t present any other
appearance than what it is. When one
turns to the pleasantly painted Rodney
Milgate’s on the other hand, the
whole force of the Crucifixion and
Transfiguration themes has been reduced
to a pallid reflection. Only on close
inspection does the intention reveal itself;
mild sensuous enchantment, it seems, is
not sufficient.
Transfixed between the twin lodes of
Picasso and Motherwell, John Coburn’s
“Golgotha” uses black and white in a
dramatic series of silhouettes, asserting
now a positive, now a negative sense of
space. The approach points rather to his
future development as a consistent
painter of religious subjects, rather than
to a culminating achievement in this
entry. Eric Smith shows no such firm-
ness in his two rather baroque fantasies,
“Agony in the Garden” and “Christ and
the Crowd”. Linear swirls amid carnival
color do not force one’s convictions. In
the past, Smith has shown that he can
rise to certain heights, but these paintings
cannot be distinguished from a whole
lot of his recent, not so important, work.
nPoM Green infuses solemnity into his
A “And Darkness Was Upon the Face
of the Deep” with heavily rendered tex-
tures and strong contrasts of light and
dark. Erica McGilchrist interests us
through her use of stained glass color and
pure whites, in a painting not quite
'abstract and not yet strong enough to
convey its imagery. A similar equivoca-
tion detracts from the visual content of
Jones-Robert Gareth’s “Tableau for an
Apotheosis”, where idea, form and tech-
nique promise more, singly, than in
unison.
Two entries by James Meldrum are
fascinating from the point of view of
weaving transparent forms overlapping
in space. Surrealist in feeling, they avoid
any real contact with the subject. Con-
stance Stokes uses two figures to evoke
a dramatic moment —“The Crowd Has
Passed”. The blacks in Emanuel Raft’s
“Ladder of Agony” likewise acquire
dramatic overtones, without stating any
more of a religious quality than a num-
ber of his usual works.
In Tasmania
Launceston Art Purchase, 1964 (
Queen Victoria Museum, Launces-
ton.
lUAtfas (The National Theatre and
Fine Arts Society of Tasmania) has
every reason to be gratified by the suc-
cess of its effort to initiate an annual
invitation art exhibition for this State.
The exhibition is expected to be held
alternately in Launceston and Hobart.
Allowing for notable abstentions, such
as French, Hessing, Hodgkinson and
Whiteley, it represents a substantial sec-
tion of the most significant of younger
Australian painters today. Even more im-
portant, perhaps, is that the majority
of the 40 pictures are good examples
of the contributors’ output.
Olsen’s “Me the Gardener” (awarded
the £lOO Purchase Prize and purchased
for the Museum) is a jubilant work, full
of that sense of urgent identification
with the pulse of things that informs all
his most exciting canvasses.
Blackman’s “Face to Face” may not
be quite typical either: it nevertheless
sheds that bouquet of tender, shadowy
nostalgia that endears his best work to
us. It was purchased for his private
collection by Mr Ken von Bibra.
“No Flies On These Philosophers” by
Edwin Tanner is a wry work which sug-
gests to me rather some private pun
about mechanical brains than a reference
to the Orr case. It badly needs some
kind of interior illumination.
Lynn’s “Ancient Shore” (bought for
the Museum) is one of the special
pleasures of the show; Percival’s flowers
are slight but gay; Daws’ “Green Man-
dala” brilliant, if eclectic; Reddington’s
“Skies in My Eyes” cool and fresh as
water from a spring.

Sydney; why not? And there were scenes
from a good many features which ap-
peared on TV in the palmy days of the
late 19505, when the Warner library was
splendidly being ransacked: Mervyn Le-
Roy’s “I Am a Fugitive from a Chain
Gang”, Michael Curtiz’s “Black Fury”,
and Leßoy’s “They Won’t Forget”, with
the famous symbolic shot of the train’s
hook snatching up the mail-bag as the
lvnch mob closes in on a defenceless
victim. May we please see all these
again?
“Friday Movie” promises to do for the
M-G-M and Paramount libraries what
Channel 9 has already been doing for
Warner’s and Fox. We have had, so
far, George Cukor’s “Dinner at Eight”,
with brilliant and unfaded performances
by Marie Dressier (in the year—l 933—
before her death) and John Barrymore,
whose suicide scene, ending with a
glimpse of the Great Profile under a lamp
as he waits for the gas to fill the hotel
room, retains a lustre undimmed in three
decades. Joseph von Sternberg’s “Dis-
honored”, with Dietrich, has also been
shown.
A new series, “Movie Masterpieces”,
will be shown on Saturday nights to suc-
ceed “Friday Movie” in late November.
Among the pictures to be shown are
King Vidor's Negro classic “Hallelujah”,
lack Conway’s and Howard Hawks’
story of the Mexican revolution, “Viva
Villa”, Frank Borzage’s beautiful “Three
Comrades”, “Trader Horn”, “Rasputin
and the Empress”, “The Champ”, “The
Guardsman”, “All Quiet On the Western
Front”, and, with any luck, “Little Man

memorable novel about the German
underprivileged in the Hitler era.

FILMS
Italian Pastiche
The Hours of Love. Director, Luciano
Salce. Savoy Theatre, Sydney.
'JpHE name of Luciano Salce is new to
me, but there’s nothing new about
his direction of this film, which is
pleasantly competent but without origi-
nality.
There are some bright patches in this
st °ry of a pair of sophisticated lovers who
marry and find difficulties in actually
living together.
The acting is above reproach. The
central performances of Ugo Tognazzi
ln d Emmanuele Riva in themselves
make the film rewarding, and Barbara
1 te el is remarkably funny as a randy,
eccentric English expatriate.
nice the story is told mainly from
e male viewpoint, Tognazzi has the
i* C er r °le- He takes full advantage of
Wlt h an understated performance as
the man who finds his mistress turning
into a person who prefers concerts to
football matches and gets cross when he’s
late for dinner.
The film is a pastiche of the tech-
niques of Italy’s most modish directors:
Fellini (wild parties and their aftermath
of satiation and shame) and Antonioni
(lack of communication, with people
giving “meaningful” looks into space and
straight into the camera).
This rueful comedy has been generally
described as “wickedly cynical”. But
the realisation that marriage is of neces-
sity less romantic than a love affair
seems more like ordinary common sense.
BEVERLEY TIVEY
THEATRE
Americans in Venice
The Aspern Papers, adapted from the
Henry James story by Michael Red-
grave. Independent Theatre, Syd-
ney.
A 19TH-century story, by an American,
of Americans in Venice seems an
eccentrically remote choice to represent
the flourishing British drama of the mid-
20th century as part of British Fortnight
in Sydney. And a good deal of the action
of the Independent’s production of “The
Aspern Papers”, which qualified only be-
cause Michael Redgrave’s adaptation was
used, seems in its turn remote.
James in the mid-20th century has be-
come for Americans so much a literary
landmark, an early manifestation of the
American Dream, or good, solid material
for theses, that it is difficult for other
English-speaking peoples to keep much
interest in him.
But the story of the attempts of a
“man of letters” to secure the literary
remains of an earlier American poet
from an elderly woman, who may or
may not have been the poet’s lover, is
a good one.
Michael Redgrave’s adaptation is an in-
telligent actor’s. He has cut the story
into manageable parts for stage purposes.
He has loosened James’ Victorian corsets
enough for the 20th century while re-
taining enough of the rich melodramatic
flavor. He has brought to the surface
emotions which in James run a subter-
ranean course, but enough of James’
subtleties and ambiguities remain, He
might have been harsher with James as
philosopher. Pearls of wisdom, prised
from the solid setting of James’ prose,
hang awfully in the air.
There were some uncertainties of pace
and emphasis in John Trevor’s pro-
duction, but he was well served by his
six players. Beatrice Tildesley as the
elderly Miss Bordereau effectively sug-
gested the desperate strength which can
still remain in a frail body.
Michelle's setting of the Bordereau
palazzo was Venice decayed. But the de-
signer, in her wish to capture the atmos-
phere of the garden, the city and the
world beyond the palazzo, seems to have
robbed the actors of too much stage-
space. In a play built on curtain scenes,
there seems no reason not to use a cur-
tain.

The Polygamous Prophet
By M. H. ELLIS
No Man Knows My History. Fawn
Brodie. Eyre & Spottiswoode. 665.
|n the 1820 s the New England of the
* United States had greatly changed
since the middle of the 17th century.
Round the Atlantic edges for an in-
creasing depth there were white clap-
board houses, village greens, and
churches that looked as if they had
been brought out from a bargain sale
in the City of London. In these more
civilised approaches the stocks were
not so much in evidence as before.
The population had to look back half
a century or so to the nostalgic
spectacle of a pair of lovers whipped
publicly for adultery and exhibited
for an hour under the gallows.
No longer in those longer settled regions
could Cotton Mather have conducted his
exciting witch hunts; no longer, indeed,
was littoral New England the land of
which Ambrose Bierce wrote:
Land where my fathers fried
Witches and hot irons applied
Oft to the Quaker’s hide
To make him spring.
But many of the old families were
moving westward to the green hills of
Vermont and western New York follow-
ing the restless years of the revolutionary
war. Joseph, the descendant of Asael
Smith of Topsfield, Massachusetts, whose
American descent dated from 1638,
moved first to Vermont where his son,
Joseph the younger, was born, and then
to Palmyra, south of the Great Lakes,
a flourishing but turgid bush town. And
presently his wife, daughter of a war
veteran, a “son of misfortune”, fol-
lowed after, taking eight sons in the
waggon along with a copy of her father’s
magnum opus which told of his “many
severe accidents met with during a long
series of years, the extraordinary cir-
cumstances of his conversion to the
Christian faith”, to which he added “a
number of hymns, composed on the
death of several of his relations.” And
through this attractive character, an-
other descendant of pioneers, young
Joseph Smith, founder of Mormonism,
inherited the traditions of several genera-
tions of pious authorship and a tendency
to epilepsy.
Joseph Smith the younger had been
born in the Green Mountains of Ver-
mont, at Sharon, which for long publicly
expressed its shame at the event with a
notice at the entrance to the township.
Palmyra, the ragged border town south
of the Great Lakes, was dotted with
Chuzzlewittian land speculators, and
impinged on by Indians and wolves.
Life was hard, but the picture of it
proves how little the essentials of human
emotions and nature change.
Palmyra was bare of the comforts
without which modern youth feels it
cannot live. There was no rock-’n’-roll
or twist —or even Rugby League or
Soccer football. But there was religion
which was played—and played rough—
as a national game. Croats and Bel-
grade Soccer teams could never have
staged anything tougher than the com-
petition between the little groups who
could register themselves as religious
sects on production of a roll of six
members.
npHESE were legion along the border and
full of competitive ingenuity. The
Freewill Baptists vied with half a dozen
other varieties of Baptist. The Foot-
washers played against the Pilgrims
whose prophet wore nothing but a bear-
skin and some fleas and offered free
love, communism and the right to
eschew washing for ever. Mrs Lee’s
Shakers seem to have been the forerun-
ners of the addicts of the Mersey Sound,
for they made the same gasping noises—
called by them “the gift of tongues”—
that are characteristic of Beatlemania,
though they were more advanced than
the moderns, since their transports were
reputed to lead them to doff their cloth-
ing while rolling on the floor and shout-
ing their ecstatic gibberish. But Mrs
Lee’s field was plagued by competition
from Mrs Jemima Wilkinson, the “uni-
versal friend” who believed herself to be
Christ in a purple robe, and who went
about with the Prophet Elijah, a
devotee subject to the medium of divine
revelation whenever he tied his girdle
so tightly that his abdomen swelled.
It is no wonder that in this saintly and
competitive atmosphere Joseph Smith,
Junior, began to have fits when he was
fifteen and to discover gold plates en-
graved in Egyptian with new Gospels,
and provided with two keystones or “seer
stones” called Urim and Thurim, which
enabled him to interpret for the less
blessed of his fellows. The language on
the two gold plates—discovered in an
old Indian mound —presumably had to be
Egyptian because the Rosetta Stone in-
scription had not yet been deciphered
and there was therefore nobody to ques-
tion Joseph’s translations, which he dic-
tated to a trusting amanuensis from
behind a blanket and enlarged as re-
quired with the help of an Angel named
Moroni.
Joseph had every aptitude needed by
a founder of a new religion. He was
tall and handsome, well endowed with
“oomph” and “it”, and renowned as a
wrestler. He played with little children
with all the charm of a Danny Kaye and
had an all-seeing insight into what his
repressed fellow borderers were yearning
for his revelations to prescribe.
These relevations were basically to the
effect that early Americans were descend-
ants of the Lost Tribes and that the Book
of Mormon was a sort of extra set of
Gospels, which would be supplemented
when needed by communications from
the Almighty through Joseph himself.
The doctrine which he promulgated
contained a little of everything from
the apostolic organisation of the early
Christians to the more esoteric forms of
Masonry; from a new Exodus material-
ising in a march led by prophets to the
promised land of the west in Illinois
and Missouri to the restoration of the
cosy domesticity of King Solomon's
Court. Fawn Brodie’s well-documented
and dispassionate yet graphic history of
Smith’s foundation of the Church of the
Latter Day Saints is both thrilling and
amazing and will appeal to all aspiring
human hearts, since every revelation
which the Almighty appeared to entrust
to Joseph was just what the doctor
ordered —especially for Joseph and his
more privileged brethren and the weaker
sisters about him. It has all the features
of Israelitic history and Christian re-
demption as it might have been re-
created by the immortal Sam Goldwyn
with Richard Burton and Elizabeth
Taylor playing leads. With the aid of his
telecommunications with the Infinite,
Joseph was able to lead his people forth
not only from New York State but from


the starving slums of v Liverpool, establish
them in green pastures and in the
fabulous city of Nauvoo which (though
there was no such word in the language)
he said meant “beautiful plantation” in
Hebrew. He was able to build temples,
found communities, newspapers and pri-
vate armies and run them all, with the
country’s policy of teetotalism, from his
own private hostelry with “hard likker”
on tap in the lounge. He could illegally
turn out and issue his own currency, and
establish a delightful matrimonial system
which allowed him (and others) to have
30 or so wives, nearly all married to
other gentlemen but in no way obligated
to tell their spouses of their secondary
marital associations. Vice versa, their
husbands seem to have had parallel
privileges, at least in the early phases of
the history of polygamy.
There were gentle carpers who were
not Latter Day Saints, and who thought
it wrong to enforce one’s voting rights
with seven-foot-long oak hearts, to lead
armed expeditions of defence, to have
more than one wife. They also objected
to such innocent operations (even when
conducted under Divine authority) as
sending out an assassin to try to shoot
the wicked Governor Bloggs who went
counter to the divine will.
It is no cause for wonder, therefore,
that Joseph found himself in gaol more
than once with the shadow of a noose
over him. The first time he escaped
when he bribed a sheriff. It is no wonder,
either, that the heathen got him in the
end and shot him down with his brother
when they rushed the gaol at Carthage
where he was being kept in protective
custody by an ostensibly friendly Gov-
ernor. He was 39 years old, but had
created an enduring religion.
When Brigham Young in 1847 led his
followers to Utah territory, which was
barren and unwanted, the Mormon
Church built itself a home and, like all
those that acquire wealth and property,
began to grow conventional. Plural
marriage was abandoned. The pure
doctrines of the Christian religion were
distilled. Nothing was left for anybody
to reprobate in Mormonism. Today it is
admired as one of the creeds whose fol-
lowers conform to rigidly enforced moral
and religious principles.
Utah is today a rich State since the
atomic age descended on it. Its gold,
copper and uranium make it rich.
About 70 per cent of all the near-million
inhabitants are today Mormons whose
church is about the biggest property
owner. It is advanced yet conservative —
shoots murderers ruthlessly, forbids
plural marriage and mixed racial mar-
riages with blacks and Mongolians, per-
mits sterilisation of the insane and feeble-
minded, and votes Republican very often.
Family Saga
The Cardboard Crown. Martin Boyd.
Penguin (revised edition). 6s.
of us whose forebears on one
side or another came to this country
in the early years of last century, land-
ing upon the desolate coasts of Tasmania
or Victoria with their cases of tools,
seeds, their Wedgwood china dessert-
services, the piano, books and even the
miniatures, understand in our blood the
strong links that bound these people to
the way of life they had left behind in
the British Isles.
If they dug out or made enough
money in the new country, they went
back again and again on visits to the
place known in their circle as “home”.
Yet when they got there, they almost
invariably found themselves longing to
return to their own homes in Australia
(possibly because some were in Govern-
ment House circles here). There they
wove a new social fabric; the same, in
some ways, but a different, freer pattern.
It is of these people that Martin Boyd
writes; people who had left much behind,
yet who gained much in the wider oppor-
tunities of the new country: the Austra-
lian scene of the emerging city of Mel-
bourne and nearby Victorian bush settle-
ment is his theme. His characters move
between this setting and the small manor-
house of a not large or important
“estate” in England. His are stories of
character development rather than of
pioneers felling trees by the hundred
(still an Australian characteristic) for
sheep and cattle pastures, or of mate-
ship, or the battle with Nature as the
bush receded into the outback. They
are developing characters, these women
and men: judges, lawyers, painters, musi-
cians. their wives and social life. “The
Cardbord Crown” tells of the writer’s
grandmother, Alice, who married into
one of these families; her father’s for-
tune, dubiously gained, she inherited: it
shows her warmth and love in her
strange reconciliation with an unfaithful
husband: “It was only a broken vase in
a house which remained standing.” She
moves with dignity and beauty through
the complicated situations of travel, con-
stantly lending money to her husband’s
family.
It is a rich story which seems to have
greater depth than “Lucinda Brayford”
or “The Montforts”, and has many pas-
sages of poetic insight and distinction of
style. Whereas in “Lucinda” and some
other books, Boyd seems to belong to the
French school of realists, piling detail on
detail to create the whole, in the “Card-
board Crown” he adds a wider and
deeper look into human nature. An
outline of the story could give no idea
of its richness and skilled technique—
the family scandal so carefully concealed
that, apparently, few of these mid-
Victorians suspect it, until the cupboard
is opened nearly 70 years later when
Great-Uncle Arthur tells the story to
Alice’s grandson. It is supplemented by
long extracts from his grandmother’s
diaries found in a battered tin uniform,
case in an outside laundry.
Of all the characters, Alice’s husband
Austin remains, to me, somewhat sha-
dowy, not emerging fully “in the round”
as the others do. And surely no manj
could have behaved as Austin did for!
ten years at home and abroad without,
being found out. But the other charac-
ters make up for this—the mildewed
Cousin Sarah casting a blight over en-
joyment, Alice’s unfortunate and senti-
mental daughter, Mildy, whom Sarah
turned into a neurotic, the members of
the family who fell down the social lad-;
der and landed with a bump at the bot-'
tom, the children and the picnics in the
bush, and the lovely incidental land-
scapes of England, Australia and Italy
that are the background, give great dis-
tinction to the book.

Terrors of War
The Ordeal of Major Grigsby. John
Sherlock. Hutchinson. 265.
The Raging Moon. Peter Marshall.
Hutchinson. 265. ,
“npHE Ordeal of Major Grigsby”
which is as much an examination
of the English character as it is an
exciting story, is a necessarily ugly book
and is only likely to be enjoyed by those
who can face the horrors implicit in its
subject matter—guerrilla warfare, Com-
munist terrorism and human frailty. John
Sherlock is a realist: his descriptions of*
atrocities and body functions are both
frequent and detailed, but, in most cases,
contextually justifiable.
The scene is Malaya in 1948 with the
British efforts to return to pre-war
normality being undermined by Chinese
guerrillas under the leadership of Chen,
Tak. Soldier - administrator General
Burke - White, an obtuse, personally
vicious stickler for tradition, is playing
into Chen Tak's hands by the enforce-
ment of a stupid programme of re-settle-
ment and re-education of the natives
regardless of the human misery it causes.
Major Harry Grigsby, unemployed and
sick with malaria since his army dis-
charge, returns to Malaya to beat Chen
Tak at his own brutal game. Uncouth
but with a hard core of integrity, Grigsby
has clashed with Burke-White before;
their enmity is stirred up anew as they,
pursue their opposing policies. Grigsby’s
affairs with the General’s frigid wife and
a mentally-retarded Malayan girl eventu-
ally trigger a violent but logical crisis
Subordinate to the main theme is


Grigsby's bullying into manhood of a
young lieutenant —a further illustration
of the British character . which is not
taken as far as it might have been.
Mr Sherlock writes tersely and well;
his political and moral points are made
so skilfully that there is no interference
with the fast-moving action. Katherine
Burke-White, the one white woman in-
volved in the plot, is the only character
whose behavior is not completely
believable. Not since Tom Chamale’s
“Never So Few” has there been such a
convincing and tightly-constructed war
novel.
Peter Marshall was crippled by polio
at the age of eighteen, since when he has
lived in a wheel-chair. He has written
of this experience factually in “Two
Lives” which was published last year.
The same experience provides the
material for his first work of fiction and,
in view of his disability, one would like
to be able to praise his achievement. Un-
fortunately, his literary skill does not
match his courage and “The Raging
Moon” has little to recommend it. It is
the sort of rebellious, culture-struck book
most writers get off their chests during
adolescence and try to forget. There
must be thousands of novels like this
shoved away in bottom drawers.
In his favor Mr Marshall has honesty,
sensitivity and an as yet uncontrolled
j facility with words; but his technique is
so self-conscious and gauche, his attitude
so puerile that the reader squirms with
embarrassment for him. So unsure of
himself is he that he cancels out prac-
tically every serious statement with a
facetious remark. His limited experience
causes him to embroider everyday things
with a form of rhetoric full of in-
accurate and tangled metaphors—which
can only be called cute. Consider this
passage where the hero has just been
called to breakfast: “The voice, the
screech, climbed the tunnel of the stairs
like a train with a jammed whistle. My
red silence shattered into a million glar-
ing, tingling, noisy nerve-endings. My
striped arm shot into the air. My eyes
snapped open with a click and my watch
told them the time. The message crawled
to my thick brain . . .”
Alternating chapters tell the separate
stories of two polio victims, a boy and
a girl, until they are both sent (because
of family strife) to the same Church
Home for the Crippled. Here their
stories merge as they inevitably fall in
love and join forces against the bigotry
and conformity of the Home and, indeed,
the world.
Bruce Pritchard is the ventriloquist’s
doll through whose mechanical lips
Peter Marshall throws his voice and his
opinions, and Annette is the female doll
brought on half-way through the act to
become an echo and an audience. By
his clumsy handling of this first-person
ventriloquial method, Mr Marshall loses
all objectivity and his characters are
never more than dolls. The other charac-
ters —the well-meaning, chirruping vicar,
the awkward parents, the manly matron,
the “do-good” visitors, the gossiping
patients are also stock figures who
never come to life. One hopes Peter
Marshall will continue to write, but he
would have been wise to have left this
one in the bottom drawer.

painters, especially Picasso and Braque;
he coined the world “surrealist” (origi-
nally he considered “surnaturalist”, but
rejected it as “less convenient”) to
describe his satiric drama “Les Mamelles
de Tiresias”; and he was arrested (quite
unjustifiably) for suspected complicity in
the theft of the Mona Lisa from the
Louvre. Even in France, between the
wars, Apollinaire was little more than
the object of a minor cult, ranking as
a figure slightly more important than
his friend Alfred Jarry of “Übu Roi”.
His two collections of poems, “Alcools”
and “Calligrammes”, had become literary
curiosities by the time they were re-
printed not long before World War 11.
Since 1950, however, Apollinaire has
been thoroughly exhumed. At least
eight volumes about his life and works
have appeared in French or English, in-
cluding reprints of his poems, prose and
art criticisms, as well as Marcel Adema’s
first full-dress biography. There are now
courses in Apollinaire at the Sorbonne
and a spate of essays on various aspects
of his Protean personality in French,
American and English journals. Even
in his shabbiest days, when he was grub-
bing in the “enfer” collection of the
Bibliotheque Nationale in search of sub-
jects to earn his next bottle of Beaujolais,
Apollinaire was always convinced that
posthumous fame would be his. His
shade in the Elysian fields has not been
disappointed.
Modern admirers of Apollinaire fall
into two groups. There are those,
mostly non-French, who regard him pri-
marily as a penetrating and original art
critic whose poetry was a more or less
harmless aberration. Few authoritative
art historians, however, subscribe to this
view. Apollinaire’s fanfaronades on be-
half of his painter friends, with their
generous, muddled enthusiasms and
broadsword slashes at academic pom-
posity, make lively reading but as serious
works of criticism they are negligible.
Francis Steegmuller sums them up
neatly: “For innovation in art Apollinaire
had an erratic flair, like that of a hound
who picks up too many scents, and he
did a good deal of happy, excited bark-
ing about it”.
In the view of the second group,
Apollinaire’s reputation really rests on
his collections of poems and the hand-
ful of prose pieces which decorated the
pages of the journals which he edited or
to which he contributed. Apollinaire
has been called the last of the Symbolists
—a title that he himself would have
rejected with contumely, for Apollinaire
saw himself as a revolutionary and not
a fin-de-siecle figure. He professed to
have broken through the decaying lan-
guage of Symbolism to reach a much
harsher, more vivid and realistic poetic
vision. Nevertheless, except perhaps in
the last cryptic utterances of the “Calli-
grammes”, Apollinaire’s muse never quite
succeeded in freeing herself from the
seductive entanglements of Symbolism.
Apollinaire experimented with many
forms and his restless eclecticism pre-
vented him ever achieving major literary
stature. That, of course, is part of his
fascination.
Apart from the translation of Adema’s
biography, published 12 years ago, Steeg-
muller’s book is the first -full-length
account in English of Apollinaire’s life.
The author has added the result of his
own researches to Adema’s labors; he has
pursued the ghost of Apollinaire through
the ephemeral little journals that, in
Paris as nowhere else, flicker into life
and then as abruptly disappear; he has
read widely among the writings of
Apollinaire’s friends and foes. The re-
sult is a most entertaining picture of
Apollinaire in his milieu, the last Bohe-
mian age of Paris —for postwar Paris,
with its flood of foreign expatriates and
the shoddy “Latin Quarter” commercial-
isation. was never quite the same again.
Apollinaire was 23 when he made his
debut in Paris and began reading his
poems in the smoky cellar of the Cafe
du Depart on the Quai Saint-Michel,
where Verlaine, Jarry, Jules Romains and
Charles Maurras were among his audi-
tors. He edited a short-lived review,
“Le Festin d'Esope”, which, says Steeg-
muller, was notable for “a few of the
most delicate of Apollinaire’s own
traceries against a background of rather
crazy cobwebs”. By then he had suffered
the first of his numerous frustrating love
affairs, with an English governess, Annie


Playden, who inspired the “Chanson du
Mal-Aime”. ,
The year 1904 brought a turning point
in Apollinaire’s career. Within a few
months he met the painters Picasso,
Matisse, Vlaminck and Derain. A little
later he introduced Braque to the circle
that gathered in Picasso’s studio in
Montmarte, in a tenement known as Le
Bateau Lavoir from its fancied resem-
blance to the wooden washing sheds built
out from the banks of the Seine. For
the rest of his life Apollinaire was an
enthusiastic propagandist for the new
young artists, especially the Cubists
though the Dadaists and Futurists also
tried to him as their literary cham-
pion. In their later days of fame Picasso
and Braque spoke slightingly about
Apollinaire’s critical ability, but they
never denied the importance of his role
as trumpeter in bringing their names
before the French public. How much
of Apollinaire’s activity was due to a
genuine appreciation of what the artists
were trying to do, and how much to a
characteristic desire to startle the bour-
geoisie, it is impossible to say.
Fernande Olivier, Picasso’s mistress
of those garret days, has left an acidly-
etched picture of the relationship be-
tween Apollinaire, Picasso and the rest
of the avant-garde group, with their
explosive mixture of egotism, genius and
penury. “There was a communion of
mind, of art, often of ideas”, she says.
“Rarely communion of heart, of genero-
sity. And so many protestations of ad-
miration, of friendship, in which sin-
cerity played so small a part.” Picasso
himself later admitted that his only
thought was to save his own skin when
he was hauled in for police questioning
during the Mona Lisa affair in 1911.
Both he and Apollinaire had been impli-
cated in the earlier and comparatively
minor business of the theft of a few
Romano-Spanish statuettes from the
Louvre, and Apollinaire spent a brief
time in the cells before the authorities
were convinced that he had nothing to
do with the disappearance of the Mona
Lisa.
Apart from sketches, occasional poems
and literary and art criticisms contributed
to the Paris reviews, Apollinaire’s out-
put was not large. At one time he was
reduced to churning out erotica for a
living, including editing an anthology of
the Marquis de Sade, translating Are-
tino’s sonnets and writing a preface for
“Les Memoires de Fanny Hill”. It was
not until the few years before the first
war, after he had published his curious,
dream-like prose selections, “L’Enchan-
teur Pourrissant” and “L’Heresiarque et
Cie”, that Apollinaire emerged as an
author known beyond the narrow con-
fines of a coterie.
From 1912 to 1914 he edited “Les
Soirees de Paris”, one of the most stimu-
lating of the little Paris magazines which
contained some of Apollinaire’s best
pieces of prose and poetry as well as the
first comprehensive accounts of the
painting of Matisse, Vlaminck, Braque,
“Douanier” Rousseau and Marie Lauren-
cin (with whom Apollinaire had his
longest and most afflicting love affair). In
1913 Apollinaire published “Alcools”,
the collection of 55 poems written be-
tween 1898 and 1913 on which his
literary reputation really rests. Albert
Camus has ranked “Alcools” with Rim-
baud’s “Illuminations” among the most
astonishing works French poetry has pro-
duced. Duhamel called “Alcools” a junk
shop. It is indeed an extraordinary
assemblage of Apollinaire’s experiments
in style from the simplicity of “Le Pont
Mirabeau” to his most bizarre dabblings
in “Cubist” verse. In the first year,
“Alcools” sold 350 copies of an edition
of 600.
Outbreak of war put an abrupt end to
“Les Soirees de Paris”. Apollinaire joined
a French artillery regiment, entered into
military life with surprising gusto, wrote
poems from the trenches to two simul-
taneous mistresses and, in 1916, suffered
a severe head wound that kept him in
hospital for months. He died from in-
fluenza two days before the Armistice in
November, 1918, having married his last
love, Jacqueline Kolb, “la jolie Rousse”,
only six months earlier.
Steegmuller has written an excellent
biography and admirers of Apollinaire
will be grateful to find that he has in-
cluded bilingual texts of seven of his
subject’s best known poems.

A Good Keen Man. Barry Crump.
A. H. & A. W. Reed. 21s. 6d.
Ships and Sailormen. A. A. Kirk.
A. H. & A. W. Reed. 31s. 6d.
Oarry Crump was more than just a
good keen man. As a Government
deer stalker in bush-clad back country of
New Zealand's North Island he was
enterprising, intrepid, and very tough.
He was also extraordinarily self-
sufficient, living alone sometimes for
weeks in isolated camps.
The book's dedication, “For L.S.D.”,
sets the tone from the beginning with a
style that is droll and pithy, spiced with
the crisp idiom of the Kiwi back country
man.
Crump got his first deer stalking iob
by putting his age up two years. Even
so it made him only 18. “It’s a bit young
for this caper,” said Jim, the officer in
charge. When Crump arrived at his first
base camp no one was around. So he
split open the letter Jim had given him
for the boss and read —“This is Barn
Crump. He looks to me like a gool
keen man . .
He had joined the Government’s cam
paign to reduce the population of deer
pigs, goats, and possums—animal;
earlier introduced into the country, noty
pests. Cullers were being paid £7 10s,
a week, plus 10s. for each skin, ss. for
a tail. In some districts, good hunters
were getting 1000 deer each in a seasom
Crump considered one of his scores of
715 deer and 72 pigs very poor. “Seven
months of slogging for a lousy £600.”
' The language is simple and expressive,
the humor entirely unselfconscious. Nc
wonder it was a best-seller in New Zea
land. But the zest and sparkle o!
Crump’s prose, and especially his talent
for bringing characters to life—thos v
“good keen men” whom Jim kept sendy
ing in as hunting mates —with insight
and wry comment give this book an
appeal that is universal.
Barry Crump represents the new
generation of New Zealand writers.
Before the war at any rate, any signifi-
cant New Zealand writing revealed a>
frustration at the isolation from Europe,
and still expressed a feeling of exile from
the “Old Country”. Mr Crump accepts
New Zealand as his homeland. He
writes of isolation, but it is an isolation
savored and sought, rather than en-
dured. 4
“Ships and Sailormen” is the work of
an enthusiastic amateur —a collection of
facts and anecdotes in ponderous prose
about skippers and ships, many of which
were well-known on the Tasman run,
such as Awatea, Monowai, and Maun-
ganui. The Awatea, as Mr Kirk recalls,
was skippered by Captain A. H. Davey
(father of Jack Davey of radio fame) ancb
constantly created drama in the ’thirties.
“Eight-ten Davey” they called him
because he always reckoned to berth at
Sydney, Auckland or Wellington at pre-
cisely 8.10 a.m., and usually did so,
regardless of speed regulations and
small harbor craft in his wake.
The Awatea went down fighting in the
Mediterranean in 1942. The Monowai
ended its war career with an exotic
assignment carrying Russian prisoners-
of-war from Marseilles to Odessa.
Chronologically, the book is a hotch-
potch and rather tails off with chapters
on the much earlier activities of an
Auckland company which operated
coastal and river passenger vessels. Its
skippers became local heroes because of
their skilled seamanship in negotiating
the treacherous sand bars of west coast
harbors, such as the Manukau and
Kaipara, and navigating narrow rivers.
Old-timers will probably get a good deal
of nostalgic enjoyment from this book
and its many photographs.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Borrowing Euro-dollars
Itfß Holt, Australia’s Treasurer, has discovered first hand
what other financiers discover these days when they
trek through New York and London. The US Interest
Equalisation Tax has achieved its purpose of tightening up
the flow of American loan funds outside the country and
has added about 1 p.c. to the borrowing rate. With
several New York loans due to mature in the next few
years, Mr Holt has no immediate problem. He is never-
theless discovering that it is not so easy to raise money
overseas at favorable rates.
The Interest Equalisation Tax is scheduled to be removed
in 1965, by which time the US Administration hopes it
will contribute towards the closure of the dollar gap. In
the meantime, various US lending houses are said to have
switched their operations to London, where they deal
directly in Euro-dollars.
Although the business in Euro-dollars has been going
on for seven years or more, it has achieved fresh impetus
since the introduction of the US Interest Equalisation Tax,
as a result of which London’s foreign exchange brokers
(all nine of them) have formed FEBA (London) Ltd. to
arrange foreign exchange currency business between Lon-
don banks.
The reason why the nine members of the Foreign
Exchange Brokers’ Association had not been so active
previously was that the major banks tended to deal directly
with each other. But with the Euro-dollar business growing
rapidly and many smaller banks coming into the field,
FEBA (London) Ltd became a convenient clearing house
for loan requests because of its direct telephone lines to
60 banks in London.
Inevitably, the switch to Euro-dollars caused a tightening
of credit screening and it is not that easy to obtain funds.
With demand switched from New York, the traditional
loan market in England is fairly tight, with rates at 6 p.c.,
a level which Mr Holt does not find overly attractive when
compared with 5 p.c. at home.
Against this, however, is the bolstering effect gained
in Australia’s overseas reserves, because money borrowed
overseas is credited as an addition to reserves a very
important consideration if the Government is going to
spend large sums overseas on defence commitments.
However, it is now discovered that if Australia borrows
Euro-dollars, the list of subscribers won’t change drastic-
ally, because about half the subscriptions to Australian
loans raised in New York came from European investors.
If Australia borrows Euro-dollars, therefore, European
investors may find they are subscribing funds to repay New
York loans to which they were originally subscribers any-
way. Australia should have no difficulty in raising money
this way, because her credit standing is good and the
volume of loans maturing on the New York market is not
large.
Auctioning New Issues
A current talking point in Stock Exchange circles is
the suggestion that investors should be allowed to
tender for public issues, as is customary in the UK. One
advantage, of course, is that potential investors may be
encouraged to enter the company flotation arena, which
previously they felt was the domain of professional investors
or pet clients of stockbrokers.
A sour point with the public is that, if they want to
buy shares in what they consider to be a good share issue,
they must pay the inflated price available to the “stag”
who was fortunate enough to gain an allocation from the
underwriting broker. The “stags” who obtain such an
allocation usually try to remain in the good books of the
broker by giving him extra business when it is known that
a new flotation is coming up.
With investment interest currently reputed to be on the
dull side and supported mainly by the usual hard core of
investors, sharebrokers need a wider interest from the
public. There is no doubt that funds are available, judged
only on the record levels of savings bank deposits at
around £2300m.
Strictly speaking, the auction of share issues is no
innovation to Australia, because the Australian Gas Light
Company frequently auctioned its new issues in the past.
Several other companies have offered shares for sale by
tender, though the instances are rare (such as Mount
Morgan’s issue in 1937).
There are many traps, however, particularly when new
and relatively unknown companies offer their shares for
subscription by tender. A broker or a competitor could
tender for the lot. An effective system used in Britain
is to average out the bids and fix a definite placement price.
In such cases, the low bidder usually misses out. The
shares go to the bidders who bid at or above the finally
determined placement price. The big bidder with plenty
of money may outdo the small bidder, unless applications
are scaled down.
Even here, there is scope for abuse, as many UK share-
brokers discovered. Cheques accompanying big subscrip-
tion offers for shares often could not be met. The applicant
usually counted on the fact that the application money
would not be banked until allocations had been completed
and cheques made out for a refund of excess money. Also,

hopeful applicants often made out excessive cheques know-
ing their allocation would be refused or scaled down. If
the application was refused, the cheque would be returned.
This system of over-ordering in the hope that the big bidder
eventually would end up with at least a small parcel of
shares backfired when applications were made the subject
of bank clearance and it was discovered that a high per-
centage of would-be investors had tendered large cheques
simultaneously in several flotations. The huge over-
subscriptions then being reported proved to be grossly
overstated.
The auction system of tendering for new issues certainly
commends itself to vendors of company shares, as they
could eliminate the “stags” and obtain more than they
would under a normal fixed placement price. But some
careful screening would be necessary and an attempt made
to spread the shares as widely as possible. With many
new names on the application lists, brokers should not
object, provided they still have some say in the handling
of the issue.
Insuring the Exporter
A reminder that exporters do not always get paid for
their goods is given in the annual report of EPIC
(Export Payments Insurance Corporation), which indicated
that a claim of £19,578 was paid because an importer’s
bank in Bolivia failed to meet commitments under its
irrevocable letter of credit.
EPIC, owned and operated
by the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment, is a member of the
international association of
export credit insurers, which
insures exporters against loss.
Claims of £32,763 were
relatively small in 1963-64
although representing 20 p.c.
of EPIC’s premium income of
£164,695. Evidently the prob-
lems of collecting from over-
seas buyers have increased
since June 30, because Aus-
tralian exporters have notified
that three overseas shipments
worth a total of £200,000 are
overdue for payment.
Political problems are
sometimes responsible for
non-payment, including recent
instances in British Guiana,
Chile, Egypt and Syria. But
there is a variety of causes,
including a recent case when
an import regulation was intro-
duced in the US.
EPIC reports there has
been a substantial growth in
insured exports to Egypt,
Israel, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and West Irian,
though the volume of insured exports to Western Europe
and North America has dropped.
A total of 436 policies was issued during 1963-64
insuring a total estimated export turnover of £63.7m., of
which wool was the major item at £25.6m., followed by
zinc and steel £6.7m. Australia’s total exports were
£1,383m., which indicates that the insured exports rep-
resented only a small but growing proportion. It is interest-
ing to note in the accompanying graph that 47.5 p.c. of
Australia’s insured exports go to Eastern countries.
Destination of EPIC Insured Exports
The latest report of the Export Payments Insurance Cor-
poration (EPIC) is referred to in an article on this page.
The destinations and respective proportions of insured
exports during 1964 are illustrated on the above map.
With Courage or Caution?
TINDER the above heading, the “Canberra Comments”
published by the Associated Chambers of Commerce
of Australia, makes a warm plea for more action to develop
freer trade between Australia and New Zealand.
Pointing out that it is about eighteen months since the
respective Trade Ministers set up their Joint Standing
Committee to study trans-Tasman trade, ACCA believes
something concrete should follow so much “talk and
speculation”. J
The Chambers recognise the delays caused by necessary'
attendance at the Kennedy Round negotiations and the!
UN Conference on Trade and Development. Significantly,
too, they face the situation of each country excluding
certain commodities from a “free trade” area.
Even a “limited” area, though, will have to conform
with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which
both countries have signed. GATT requires, for qualifica-
tion as a free trade area, the elimination of “substantially
all” duties and restrictive regulations.
However, GATT does permit interim agreements before
the full establishment of customs unions or free trade areas.
Australia wishes to keep dairy produce and lamb out
of negotiations, while New Zealand speaks of continued
protection for “a number of industries (particularly those!
of recent establishment or where there was a known poten-
tial)”. New Zealand’s reservations may furnish the chief
difficulties.
For each country plainly
admits that trends in world
trade are against reliance upon
primary products. What bene-
fits, then, can New Zealand!
be brought to see in a measure
of industrial integration with
Australia?
The Secretary of Australia’s
Department of Trade, Sir
Alan Westerman, speaking in
Auckland recently, argued
that the development of one
manufacturing process leads’
to the development of others
and that the industrialisation
of one area leads to the in-
dustrialisation of others.
He was obviously attempt-
ing to suggest that New Zea-
land’s potential for economic
hydro-electric supply, it s
natural resources and avail-
able skilled workers could do
nothing but benefit from the
wider market originated by a
free trade area.
Admittedly the prevailing
terms of trade between Aus-
tralia and New Zealand would mean that freer trading
confers a smaller proportional effect on the Australian
economy. Existing protective barriers can, however, be
phased out quite gradually.
Writing on this same subject in the August “Australian
Outlook”, Associate Professor E. J. Tapp (of Armidale)
says, “The sober fact is that the trans-Tasman trade has
always been limited by the similarity of the two countries’
basic primary products and hindered further by their pro-
tectionist policies towards their own manufacturing indus-
tries.”


“CROESUS”
Mr Rattigan Bides His Time
Moving towards a wider inquiry into industries
fPHE Australian Tariff Board need make
-® no apology to anybody on the score
of reporting the results of its hearings
during the course of the year. Nor can
anybody deny that its annual report,
issued last week, is a useful document
giving a round-up of trends in Aus-
tralian industry as revealed by the
Board's investigations into applications
for protective assistance over the period.
We will have a look at the most import-
ant of these revelations in a moment,
merely stating in passing that these
occupy but one page and a bit in the
Board’s 53-page report for 1963-64.
First, however, one must say that the
latest report loses something by omitting
what one found to be the most interest-
ing feature of previous reports—that is, a
series of short accounts of the main
inquiries undertaken on individual refer-
ences to the Board during the year, to-
gether with the recommendations on
them.
These summaries were previously in-
cluded “to illustrate the principles and
methods used by the Board”. Although
the list was not comprehensive, the
accounts served to give industrialists and
general public alike a handy time-saving
mirror on the Board’s thinking, which
otherwise could only be gleaned from a
reading of the many voluminous and un-
heralded intermittent single reports on
individual references issued in the course
of the year. Last year a record number
of 70 reports was signed by the Board
and this didn’t include the special in-
vestigations referred to it by the Minister
of Trade in connection with the Kennedy
Round of tariff negotiations at GATT,
which involved the examination of Most
Favored Nation rates of duty on 135
tariff items. Nor did it include a further
three interim reports on the general
textile reference, probably the most
comprehensive task before it and on
which it has so far made 14 interim
reports.
Now all we find in the annual report
about the completed references and
current investigations is long dry lists
detailing the individual references with-
out any individual comment on them.
These lists cover two-fifths of the 53-
page report. Most of the remainder of
the report is a fairly pedestrian and
mainly factual summary of the main
economic events and statistics of which,
presumably, the Board took notice in
its enquiries during the year (its penchant
is for lengthy tables of statistics, most
of which are readily available elsewhere).
When all this information is subtracted
one is left with only two of the 53 pages
throwing any light on conclusions
reached by the Board and only two short
paragraphs giving a clue to its methods
of assessing the measure of assistance
warranted by applicants.
Indeed so at pains, apparently, is the
Board to mount a respectable thickness
of paper in its annual report for last year
that it has thrown in a nine paragraph
piece on “Resource Mobility in Some
Overseas Economies”. If the Minister
succeeds in getting down that far without
nodding in his chair, it will remind him
that the measures suggested to mitigate
the pains of increasing resources mobility
G. A. RATTIGAN
are much the same as those which a now
dust-covered report on the Australian
dairy industry suggested some time back
should be adopted in the event of
marginal producers in that industry being
led by the Government into alternative
industrial pastures. What relevance this
has in a Tariff Board report on its opera-
tions during the year one can’t imagine
(Mr G. A. Rattigan, the chairman, is a
dyed-in-the-wool civil servant), unless it
is to needle the Minister on the un-
economic nature of protection to in-
dustries outside the Board’s usual pro-
vince, a matter which the Minister assist-
ing the Federal Treasurer spun a story
about in Melbourne recently but called
me up afterwards to keep it out of the
Press.
No, Mr Rattigan is not playing politics,
either in putting this or all the other
innocuous padding in the report. Nor is
he naive enough to believe that the public
will regard this stuff as an adequate sub-
stitute for the down-to-earth observations
on the working of the tariff and its effect
on the Australian economy which one
used to get from his more outspoken
predecessors like Mr McCarthy and Sir
Leslie Melville. Rather it seems that,
as a good public servant, he has a
conscience about the role of the tariff
in our economic scheme of things and,
more importantly for him, the require-
ment in the Tariff Board Act for the
Board to report generally each year on
the operation of the tariff and the
development of industries. After his first
full year as chairman he says, un-
ashamed, that “the Board has always had
difficulty in carrying out this statutory
obligation.”
So, tucked away at the end of this
year’s report we learn that, inter alia,
to facilitate the Board’s performing this
statutory task it is currently exploring
ways and means of modifying its tech-
niques and procedures to enable it to
handle the sort of wide inquiry into
industries which would alone enable it
to pronounce more convincingly on the
general working of the tariff. This is
accompanied by an admission that, by
and large, at present its individual in-
quiries are too fragmented and narrow
in scope and cover for the purpose.
The report goes on to say that wider
investigations (of the sort, say, of the
general textile reference) the Minister
might decide to refer to the Board (there
is a hint in this that he may well do so)
“would enable the Board not only to
examine the development of industries
or sectors of industry and the operation
of the tariff (and other forms of assist-
ance) but also, in connection with each
investigation, to recommend specific
changes in the assistance afforded if
found necessary. Thus a systematic
review of the tariff and Australian in-
dustry could be undertaken.”
Even so, in giving its general verdicts,
albeit in sparing fashion, on last year’s
industrial features, the Board has not
exactly been starved of pertinent refer-


ences. And, as it states, “some refer-
ences which have recently been received
are wide in scope and should enable
fuller consideration to be given to wider
industrial complexes developing in Aus-
tralia and the relationship of industries
to one another.” So “during the ensuing
year the Board will have an opportunity
to assess the practical value of the
changes in techniques and procedures
now under test”. Evidently Mr Rattigan
has already gone some way in imple-
menting his new techniques and pro-
cedures, thus giving an earnest that next
year’s report will be rather more en-
lightening than the latest one.
Skipping the platitudes and well-known
deficiencies of Australian industry, one
of the Board's main observations in this
year’s report is that it “is hesitant to
recommend protective duties at a level
which could sustain uneconomic frag-
mentation of the market”. Leading on
from this, it considers that considerable
cost savings could follow a reduction in
the number of manufacturers in some in-
dustries. This doesn’t fit in very well
with Mr Snedden’s ambitions on re-
strictive trade practices.
However, as competition has become
a Government byword, some useful
hints are thrown out to industry for in-
creasing the competitiveness of indivi-
dual firms, such as “closer attention to
control over costs, and to range and
variety of products, sales promotion and
methods of distribution” (apparently
other industries, which the Board con-
siders to have weakened their competitive
position by putting in plant in excess of
their foreseeable requirements, will be
stuck until demand expands sufficiently
to make such excesses productive).
As for labor costs, the Board’s con-
clusions are rather enigmatic. Naturally
it warns of the dangers to productivity
arising from the consequences for labor
costs of the tight labor market and over-
award payments. On the other hand,
“although costs of direct labor per unit
of production were generally higher in
Australia than overseas, direct costs did
not constitute a large part of total costs
in most industries reviewed”, so, “con-
sequently direct labor costs had only a
small relative effect on the cost dis-
abilities of the particular industries con-
cerned”. This bears out the general point
the Board makes about its references not
being sufficiently representative of in-
dustry as a whole for it to give a con-
clusive overall verdict. Even so, it says
that in some cases direct cost disabilities
were large and this also applied to over-
head costs, whose incidence was most
marked in capital intensive industries
such as chemicals and plastics which had
“a large degree of excess capacity”.
Against this, with other industries the
Board found some were in front of their
competitors (it is not quite plain if over-
seas or local firms are meant). In point-
ing to the fact that “improved pro-
ductivity per employee was assisted by
the introduction of wage incentive
schemes by some industries reviewed in
1963-64”, it says that “wage payments
by some Australian manufacturers were
higher than those of local competitors
but their unit labor costs were about the
same or lower because of greater pro-
ductivity per employee”.
Finally, as an epitaph for unsuccess-
ful applicants for tariff assistance, the
Board makes it plain that while it gener-
ally relates assistance to the lowest-cost
Australian producers, it takes a flexible
view. “Where actual prices did not pro-
vide a satisfactory basis for calculations
of the degree of assistance, it used prices
which included a margin above costs so
that the manufacturer would be provided
with the opportunity to earn a satis-
factory return on funds employed: and
when considered desirable, the costs
taken into consideration were those in-
curred in operating at a level of output
which the Board considered appropriate
in the particular circumstances.” Who
was it said we have a “scientific” tariff!
ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Far from the Madding Crowd
Debating the incidence of taxation
I>ublic resistance to threats to living
standards arising from rising
prices and increases in taxation is in full
swing. Apart from the actions of official
Labor bodies calling for another round
of wage increases and the re-introduction
of Federal price control, in Victoria, if
not elsewhere, one finds people now
walking to work to save fares and doing
with a little less bread, milk and honey
on the misplaced theory that reduced
turnovers will bring prices back to earth,
In the meantime, there is the clash
of the Institute of Public Affairs with a
group of university professors attempting
to resolve the question whether Australia
is one of the lowest taxed nations on
earth. This may seem far from the
madding protesting crowd, but the con-
troversy has thrown up some basic points
for the wider public issue involved by
the incidence of taxation on prices. On
one of these points, Mr C. D. Kemp,
director of the IPA, seems to have got
his university protagonists for higher
taxation in a tight corner. One says this
without involving oneself in the main,'
issue at stake.
At the very least, if Kemp is referring
to an economy whose labor resources are
fully employed (such as Australia at the
present time), one has to agree with hisi
argument “that if Government spending
is increased in all the different directions
advocated by many university econo-
mists and taxes raised to finance the in-
creased expenditure, the result will be
inflation”.
This echoes the criticism of the main
point in Professor Downing’s paper on
‘The Cost of Defence” at the summer
school of the Australian Institute of Poli-
C. D. KEMP
tical Science earlier this year. There
he argued that a switch of 2 to 5 p.c.
of Gross National Product from con-
sumption to defence and development,
which he considered necessary in the
next few years, could be comfortably
achieved through the medium of taxa-
tion without causing inflation.
Of particular relevance here is what
the IPA has to say in its latest “Review”
on the resistance of consumers to
attempts to cut their consumption by in-
creasing taxation. In pointing to what
it calls perhaps the most outstanding
phenomenon of present-day society, that
is the expectation of a steadily rising
standard of living year by year, the IPA
says the natural resistance to a cut in
consumption or living standards has now
been reinforced not only by stronger
motives but also by more effective means
to resist.
Thus, “Today we live in a middle class
society with middle class ambitions and

HOW TO
AVOID UNDUE
DEATH DUTIES
AND TAXES
Death duties and income taxes are inevitable—there is no
avoiding them. But they may be minimised. Wise, provident
people protect their estates against the erosion of taxes and
duties by setting up legal, acceptable plans for the adminis-
tration of their estates. They achieve considerable savings,
to the ultimate welfare of their beneficiaries.
You should examine these plans to ensure that your estate
is protected against the damaging effect of unduly large
assessments. Send this coupon for a helpful Union-Fidelity

expectations. Attempts to cut or even
restrain individual consumer spending
thus run up against a rather intractable
obstacle. To maintain, or more, to
sustain the improvement in their living
standards, people will reduce or run
'down their savings, buttress their expendi-
ture with additional borrowing and seek
to increase their money incomes to
counterbalance the higher taxes they are
called upon to pay”.
The fact is the community is not pre-
pared to retreat from its accustomed
'rising standards of living, which in the
last sixteen years have taken its overall
expenditure at constant prices on per-
sonal consumption up by about H p.c.
on average a year, or by as much as
20 p.c. overall —albeit on a changing
pattern of preference in which expendi-
ture per head on food has been pretty
stable; that on durable consumption
goods, motor cars, services, refreshments,
tobacco and home buying has risen sig-
nificantly, and on clothing, footwear,
fares, entertainment have shaded per
jhead.
It is but an extension of the IPA’s
argument to point out that the com-
munity reacts in similar ways to resist
the effects of rising prices on its living
standards. The link with taxation of
some of the current price increases, say
iin Victoria, since the Federal and State
i Budgets is patently clear, though in some
instances, such as rises in fares and
freight rates, it is at one remove. The
latter are virtually tax increases.
The various Governments’ efforts to
grab more resources at the expense of
the private sector are not, of course,
confined to attempts to cut consumption.
Equally, the fitting in of more for de-
fence and development involves measures
to divert investment resources from the
private to the public sector or, as seems
to be the case at present when public
investment is rising rapidly, to dampen
private investment in an attempt to stop
the overall total of investment becoming
excessive. The IPA also has something
pertinent to say about this.
It limits its observations on this occa-
sion to fiscal measures.
The IPA seems to think that business
and public alike should act responsibly
in situations in which they are being
more heavily taxed. This is the line one
would expect it to take. Even so, Mr
Kemp refuses to stay in the clouds of his
academic correspondence. So, while
being quite firm that tax increases should
be taken as warnings by all sections of
the community to observe moderation in
their demands on resources by tailoring
their spending programmes accordingly,
he admits quite bluntly that “if inflation-
ary forces should gain the upper hand in
the coming twelve months, the commu-
nity itself will not be free from blame”.


The Bad Debts Epidemic
Moral decline or indiscriminate selling?
credit where credit is due, goes
the old saying. But the impression
many investors have gained over the
past few weeks following announce-
ments of huge sums of bad debts, is that
perhaps too much credit has been given
where none is due. If three large Sydney
retailers announce bad debts write-offs
totalling £1.2 million, it is anybody’s
guess how much both private and public
companies have given up as lost this
year. One man has estimated £lO mil-
lion this year. A rash estimate, say some,
but the fact remains that even though
customers have never had it so good,
they have never treated it so bad.
Once again the disclosure of this large
volume of bad business has renewed
efforts to set up a central credit refer-
ence bureau. Instead of credit companies
referring to each other for credit ratings
of applicants, they could contact a single
office into which and from which infor-
mation on every credit customer in NSW
would flow. This has become a neces-
sity for the industry.
“There are too many professional
cheats among credit customers nowa-
days,” one retailer told The Bulletin.
“We have caused it ourselves by pro-
viding too-easy credit and by not dissem-
inating our information to the point
where it would be well nigh impossible
for anyone who is not a good risk to get
credit. The customer today is offered
credit competition, terms competition,
goods competition and trade-in competi-
tion. They are all inventions of the
retailer and by offering them we have cut
our own throats.” That is one explana-
tion.
Although competition is in part respon-
sible, the biggest single contributing
cause is undoubtedly a general lack of
credit checking coupled with a failure to
recognise bad debts early in the piece,
But, even when debts have been recog-
nised as bad, there has been a reluctance
by some firms to write them off because
they hope that the debts will come good,
Surely a case of shutting one’s eyes,
wishing the debts will go away!
Credit in Australia has been refined,
adjusted, extended and glorified to the
point where, today, if there were no
credit, our economy would fall apart at
the seams . Tod almost a thi J, can

centage of these losses through door-to-

ducted Qn a credi( basis The customer
is called upon once a week or fortnight
by a traveller who collects payments and
takes orders. Nor is it a coincidence that
these credit retailers all deny they indulge
in high-pressure tactics. They agree,
though, that in many cases the customer
miscalculates his or her ability to stay
within a budget, which leads to payments
juggling, clearouts and the flimsiest of
excuses. In one instance, a woman cus-
tomer stoutly denied she held an account
with the store which called on her, even
though theTiaker and neighbors on either
side identified her as the woman it
question. Certainly, in cases of genuint
hardship (“The old man’s on compo”
“The kids are sick and a doctor costs s
lot”, “Dad’s just got the sack and he
can’t find another job”) the retailers are
obliged to keep faith with the customei
lest she complain in print. However/
where payments are not kept up for no
apparent reason, the courses open to the
retailer for recovery of money are
limited. Standard procedure appears to
be letters from the company, followed)
by a solicitor’s letter and, finally, a sum-
mons which may or may not bring forth/
a garnishee on the customer’s wages.
Sometimes in cases where an attempt
is made to serve a summons the
customer has “cleared out” or in
other words changed homes. In some
cases where garnishees are granted,
the customer has changed jobs and
the old employer is reluctant to tell
v/here his ex-employee is working.
Legal action, say retailers, is slow and
cumbersome and affords the non-payer
too much time to get out. They all
would like a more stringent system of
legal reprisal for creditors who fail to,
honor their obligations.
Mr Nicholas Aboud, managing direc-
tor of Buckinghams Ltd, blamed a moral
decline in people’s attitudes towards cre-
dit for the large number of bad debts
write-offs. “It has happened only over
the last five years. It has happened be-
cause retailers have been far too lax in
their method of credit granting. A cen-
tral credit reference bureau to check the
validity of a customer’s application
for credit is sadly needed in Sydney.
There are a few operating now but
on the majority of accounts none of
them has the information whether
they are good or bad. We have
had a look at a lot of these credit
bureaux around the world and the one
closest to our needs is the Greater Lon-
don Credit Reference Bureau, a non-
profit organisation which has been set up
by a number of trade associations repre-
senting companies and firms granting
credit of all kinds. It lists credit risks
by address and name and not name and
address. While a person can easily
change his name it is not so easy for him
to change his address.”
Mr Aboud’s company, which suffered
a loss at the hands of bad home selling
debts, has consequently undertaken a
major reorganisation of its bookkeeping
and accounting to bring bad debts to
light far sooner than they appeared be-
fore. As they are revealed they are
written off monthly, and not allowed to
accumulate as they had been in the past.
The company’s outside work force of
approximately 200 salesmen is matched
by an indoor accounting staff. “The
type of customers we serve are those in
middle to low class areas and usually

people who buy everything on credit.
They pledge themselves more or less
right up to their last shilling, and pro-
bably more often than not they over-
commit themselves. But we at present
have no way of checking. If a person
comes to us for credit they give as refer-
ences only those people they know will
assure us that their credit is good . . .
we have no way of telling how many
bad accounts they are operating.
“But competition has more or less
forced us to accept a customer on face
value. There are so many forms of com-
petition in credit retailing, and especially
in home selling that we have been a little
too willing, in the past, to accept custom.
However the moral decline in people’s
attitudes is worrying. Previously the cus-
tomer would make every endeavor to
keep up with his payments. Now a per-
centage couldn’t care less, they think it’s
some sort of a game, to avoid paying.
We are finding now that we need to take
stronger action more quickly.”
A pertinent reason for reluctance to
pay in a time of relatively easy money,
feels Mr Aboud, is the increased gam-
bling facilities in NSW. Before the poker
machine became synonymous with the
empty pay packet “Dad used to go home
with it unopened and put the weekly
payments on each credit account to one
side. Now he has a club to go to and
{if he loses money he may neglect to pay
each account weekly. He juggles the
accounts hoping to make up next week.
It’s not often he does. The only way
we can overcome these problems is by
extremely stringent credit checking.”
Although exact details have not been
released at time of writing Marcus Clark,
which has been selling door to door
since 1895, has forecast a deficit on
operations for the year to August 1. It
will be the first loss the company has
suffered since 1929. Here again bad debts
are partly the cause. The company’s
director of credit and accounting, Mr
J. G. Baillie, said it had adopted a strict
definition of a bad debt which caused the
substantial write-off. To ensure that a
major problem does not occur again
listing and analysis would be carried out
every three months. Also affecting the
result had been the store’s modernisation
and development programme which
would be finished in time for Christmas
this year.
“The pattern of credit has changed
over the last few years due to fierce com-
petition in retailing,” he said. “We had
virtually no bad debts in the 1950-60
period when money was harder to come
by than it is now. People now are more
credit-conscious than they have ever been
• —they know as much about it as the
retailers do. Some of our customers
Who in the past have been good payers
have become bad credit risks for no
apparent reason.
“It is a social sickness in Sydney that
people do not pay on time, so vve have to
contend with not only those people who
don’t pay, but also those who don’t pay
promptly. Most of our home credit
customers are in the middle class groups.
We don’t like to get into the very low
income groups but when we do we are
very strict in granting credit.
“T'he volume of bad debts points up
A the urgent need for an organisation
to deal solely with a customer’s credi
rating. But the decision makers are not
actively looking at ways to implement
this. We are not going to get anywhere
unless everyone comes to the party
Some years ago American retailers ex-
perienced the same trouble with bac
debts but now that they have a credit
reference office the picture is completely
different.
One home retailing company which
claims it does not suffer a bad debts pro-
blem is Waltons Ltd, which earned
record profit of £1,444,905 in the year to
July 31. Chairman Mr John Walton
said that before the profit was struck all
bad debts were written off. “Likewise all
bad debts have been written off each
year in the past. The company has
always maintained effective control over
its customers’ accounts.
“This control has been simplified by
the fact that 90 p.c. of all credit appro-
vals are to established customers who
have satisfied the company concerning
both their willingness and capacity to
pay. Under the long standing proce-
dures of the company all customers’ ac-
counts are subject to continuous review
and control. A regular and frequent
internal as well as external audit ensures
the effectiveness of these procedures. It
is not possible that any hidden pocket of
bad debts could occur and escape being
written off.
“Of the debts that are written off, a
substantial proportion is regularly re-
covered in cash in ensuing periods.”
The third company to be affected
recently by bad debts arising out of home
selling is Bebarfalds. Write-offs in this
division totalled £52,892. Coupled with
an increase of £103,844 in the provision
for doubtful debts and an operating loss
of £67,691, the total loss was £224,427
—the first loss the company has incurred
since 1933.
Bebarfalds has been in the home sell-
ing field for about two years. Directors
said in the preliminary report that sales
and estimated profits for the first
six months of the latest year were
inflated by the rapid expansion in
the home sales division. “Budgeted
sales and profits for the second
half of the year were not achieved due
to a decline in turnover in the company’s
home furnishings departments and the
introduction of more stringent controls
in the granting of credit in the home
sales division.
“Despite the serious loss in the home
sales division, the directors believe that
properly organised and controlled home
sales operations can make a useful con-
tribution to the business. It has been
decided, therefore, to continue this
operation but on a reduced scale and
with more adequate credit control.”

The Second Century Affair
Sharebrokers and their directorships
fjThe generous space which the Mel-
A bourne dailies devoted to the Second
Century affair last week (at the expense,
we might add, of shadowing more import-
ant news such as the terms and name of
the unsuccessful National Bag bidder)
served only one really useful purpose.
Once again the controversial question
of whether sharebrokers should also b
directors of listed companies, especial!
ones they have floated, was brought tj
the fore.
This problem has, in fact, been thi
core of the whole business. Yet thost
writers who did not see fit to point it ou/<
mentioned it only as a mere afterthought
Second Century’s directors cannot be
criticised for the wide discrepancy be-
tween their encouraging interim reporj
and their dismal final 1963-64 results]
True, they may not have been keeping
a close enough eye on the firm’s factor]
ing activities. The year’s loss may thus
have surprised them as much as it did
shareholders. But can they be criticised
for this? Such mistakes can be made ever
in the best run companies. It is a risk
which every shareholder takes.
Nor does criticism appear warranted,
for their withholding news of the com-
pany’s state of affairs from August 12
(when they first discovered the position)
to September 2 (when the results were
released to the Press and the Stock
Exchange). As Mr D. M. Ferguson,
chairman, explained in a letter to the Ex-
change: “It was realised that if publica-
tion of these figures caused a run on
our call and deposit moneys and or a
calling up of our overdrafts the company
could be in serious difficulties.”
That is fair enough, because certain
measures had to be taken to prevent such
a position. This was done by September
2 and the report was released immedi-
ately. To date, the chairman told the
Exchange, there has been “no run on
our call or deposit moneys. Our liquid
position is satisfactory and all commit-
ments are being met as they fall due.”
This being so, one respects Mr Ferguson’s
further statement that “the responsibili-
ties of directors extend beyond compli-
ance with the listing requirements of the
Stock Exchange. In our particular case
I and my co-directors acted in what they
believed to be the best interests of all
parties creditors, shareholders and
investors.”
The company itself seems to have acted
properly. This is not to say that the
affair doesn't throw a poor light on the
practice of sharebrokers being directors
of public companies. In this case, it was
found that fully paid 10s. shares fell from
12s. 6d. on August 12, when directors
first knew of the company’s troubles, to
7s. 6d. on September 2. They have fallen
further since. Similarly, the partly paid
units came back from 6s. 6d. to 2s 3d.,
now firm.
It was discovered that Wra Noall
Nominees Pty Ltd had been selling partly
paid shares over this period • shares
which had been transferred to it in June
from Mr R. W. Carroll (managing
director of Second Century) and his wife.

Good Evans
Queensland engineer and shipbuilder
Evans Deakin Industries breathes
plenty of confidence in its report for the
year ended June 30. The company had
no difficulty in holding the 12i p.c. divi
dend paid since 1961, on profit which
advanced by almost 50 p.c. to reach
£288,334.
Over the last week or so, better pros-
pects in the Australian shipbuilding in-
dustry have been well publicised, particu-
larly as a result of Federal Governmem
assurances. This situation Evans
Deakin confirms and looks forward to
tenders available for “oil tankers for the
carriage of petroleum products between
Australian ports”.
The company has already begun to
extend shipyard capacity. Latest con-
structional techniques are also being
incorporated with the new yards.
A hefty list of engineering operations
is printed in the 1963-64 report and here,
too, the situation appears extremely pro-
mising. Directors, and investors, are
doubtless relieved that normal working
conditions were achieved in July after
a lengthy bout of industrial trouble.
The recently announced one-for-five
par issue will furnish some funds for ex-
pansion. Directors are certain “the
financial position and prospects of the
company warrant an increase in share
capital”. Those raisings are to be aug-
mented by a private note issue of
£500,000 (repayable October 31, 1975)
and a £250,000 term loan.

shares at 2s. 6d. premium. It will raise

The issue follows a healthy profit in-
crease of £30,478 to £193,028, though
the 9 p.c. dividend is kept steady for the
third consecutive year. Chairman Mr
W. G. Wilson told shareholders at the
annual meeting that the company’s mills
had continued to show satisfactory re-
sults since balance date, due to the com-
pany securing a larger share of the local
market.
The company faces a decline in its

however, are negotiating arrangements
whereby the goodwill of the company’s
brands would continue to be income
earning.

ADDRESS TO MEMBERS OF
OHMS CONSOLIDATED LIMITED
BY Mr. J. OLIMS (Chairman)
AT THE THIRD ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING,
AT THE HEAD OFFICE, 51-61 PRINCES HIGHWAY, ST. PETERS,
N.S.W.,ON WEDNESDAY, 30th SEPTEMBER, 1964
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I have great pleasure in wel-
coming you to the Annual General
Meeting of your Company.
The audited accounts for the
financial year ended 30th June,
1964, are already in your hands
and speak for themselves. The
profit figure of £254,601, before
tax, indicates the continued growth
and successful operations of your
Company’s Subsidiaries.
The year just ended has again
been one of consolidation and ex-
pansion of services acquired in
new companies joining the Group.
Additional factories and offices
have been erected at St. Peters and
Caringbah, and our city and other
suburban premises extended.
Fast jet travel, direct telephone
links, and modern communication
methods have benefited Australia
more than any other country in the
world. It has placed us right in
the centre of world trade, elimina-
ting the Costly delays which had re-
tarded Australia’s export develop-
ment.
Making full use of these favour-
able conditions,' your Company en-
joys close friendly relations around
the globe, which have opened the
door to the latest developments in
our industries.
Similarly, our overseas associates
are given the opportunity to share
the benefits of our own progress
and natural resources.
These conditions have further
cemented the co-operation of our
friends and associates in England,
Europe, Japan and the U.S.A. To
expedite our overseas trading, we
have established a liaison office in
Europe and appointed local agents
in Japan and Hong Kong.
Valuable franchises have been
added in the Reprographic and
Electronic fields, and a new com-
pany has been formed under the
name of Olims-Delmont Electro-
graphics Pty. Ltd., to exploit patents
for a revolutionary new electrostatic
process for the Printing Industry.
Mention has already been made
in the Directors’ Report of our
early participation in the change-
over to Decimal Currency. I am
pleased to be able to report that,
in addition to the new machines
already supplied to the Royal Mint
in Canberra, your Company has
also received the order to supply
similar specialised equipment for
the Reserve Bank of Australia.
I am sure that the confidence
shown by these two organisations in
your Company will be followed by
an ever - increasing number of
Banks, Government and other
commercial undertakings who will
require additional decimal coin
handling equipment to cope with
the new currency system to be
introduced in February, 1966.
At this point, I should like to
reassure our shareholders that our
progress continues to be based on
a firm policy of expansion without
speculative ventures always associ-
ated with risks, and that our appar-
ent diversification is being strictly
controlled within the limits of your
Directors’ considerable specialised
knowledge of the industries con-
cerned.
In my opinion, the only criterion
of a successful Public Company is
the steady ratio of profit to issued
capital. With our present profits
assured, your Company is in the
happy position of being able to
maintain its very selective approach
to any new business propositions.
The new financial year, 1964-
1965, of which three months have
now elapsed, shows expanding pro-
gress even exceeding that of the
past year. If it continues on the
same scale for the coming three
months, I hope to have good news
for our shareholders when the half-
yearly accounts have been evalu-
ated.
In conclusion, I wish to thank
our executives and members of our
staff for their splendid efforts dur-
ing the past year, and our share-
holders for their loyal support of
our Company.
JOSEPH OLIMS
(Chairman).

dividend will be held at 10 p.c. on the
increased capital resulting from last
October’s one-for-three par issue. Earn-
ing rate has slipped back quietly from
18.2 p.c. to 16.7 p.c, on this bigger
capital.
The company’s record since listing in
1959 has been spectacular. Capital has
expanded rapidly, but the earning rate
has never been below 15.9 p.c. Dividend
has been a constant 10 p.c.
How come the company has been so
successful while others in the field have
fallen by the wayside? The main reason
must undoubtedly be the management.
Only an experienced, extremely know-
ledgeable and conservative group of top
men can run a factoring business
successfully. The traps are numerous.
Undoubtedly, the fact that the Com-
mercial Bank of Sydney and the MLC
hold substantial share interests has some-
thing to do with the success.
The year ahead looks fairly good at
present and earning rate should rise to
back over 18 p.c. Turnover in the
current year has recovered following a
setback in the final six months of 1963-
64. It was £9i million compared with
£l2 million in the first six months.
National Bag Objects
VTational Bag investors need not have
been caught unawares now that
takeover negotiations are off and the
shares have eased back. Considerable
doubts were thrown on the bid’s chances
of success (even though the negotiations
appeared to be the most promising ever
entered into by the company). It has
been emphasised that any buying on the
hope of a successful offer would be
merely a punt transaction.
Confirming the conclusions drawn in
an earlier Bulletin article, directors
revealed last week that the unsuccessful
bidder was Fibre Containers and that the
bid was between 265. and 285.—275. AH.
to be exact.
Judging by the tenor of the directors’
release, it seems that the price may have
been satisfactory, so the chances of take-
over could still be far from extinct.
Apparently it was the conditions of the
offer which made acceptance difficult
the board claimed they would not be
prepared to accept and recommend on
the basis indicated.
Who can blame them? The 275. Aid.
for each ss. share involved (a) 4s. cash
a share; (b) three Fibre shares for every
four National units; (c) five unsecured 7
p.c. notes of Is. each for each share;
(d) National shareholders to subscribe
£300,000 from their cash proceeds to a
new company; (e) this new company to
acquire a half interest in certain assets
at present owned by National sub-
sidiaries. Such a complicated and con-
fusing bid would make any board of
directors apprehensive.
With the shares now down under
20s. buying for capital gain is possible.
Briefly, working capital is historically
low, 1964-65 looks buoyant, reserves are
around twice the size of the paid capital
and, in its entire 14-year history, only
one issue has been made. It was a one-
for-four at par in 1959-60.
Promises Fulfilled
lyfouNT Morgan shareholders can glean
a goodly measure of satisfaction
from their directors’ latest report, since
it entirely confirms the happier trends
envisaged at the November, 1963, annual
meeting. With one eye on the future,
the satisfaction does not wholly stem

from 1963-64’s better profit and divi-
dend.
These latter are naturally very easy
to take, especially when earnings move
dramatically from £182,613 to £468,250
accompanied by an ordinary dividend in-
crease of 9d. a share to Is. 3d. There’s
more to it, though, than better prices
for copper and silver.
Directors do specify “an improvement
in the gross value of the metals in ore
mined and treated, the slightly lower
copper grade being more than offset by
the higher gold grade”. The company
milled a higher tonnage and also reduced
its stocks of concentrates.
Just as significant, unit production costs
went down in all departments except the
colliery.
Production and cost benefits are re-
flecting the advantages of plant modifi-
cations and additions. Gains must also be
coming from the sizeable investment in
advance overburden removal of previous
years. In fact, a “notable” increase in
gold grade occurred during the second
half of 1963-64 and violent fluctuations
in ore grades now look more avoidable.
All the favorable activity has sent the
10s. shares up to nudge their best 1964
level of 20s. and well ahead of 1963’s
top at 13s. lid. The shares are now
available around 19s. 6d.
Digging Losses
civil engineers and contrac-
tors struck bother in Queensland
during their 1963-64 years. Now it is
the turn of a Queenslander, Keith Morris
Constructions, to run into very heavy
weather in NSW.
The company has suffered its first
loss (amounting to £82,137) since for-
mation in 1955. A buoyant £87,290 had
been earned for 1962-63, to give an
18 p.c. earning rate and permit retention
of the 10 p.c. dividend launched in 1962.
Directors pass the 1963-64 dividend,
though they still carry forward £14,709
by utilising £56,846 of undistributed
profits and bringing £40,000 from
general reserve.
Excavation on the Hawkesbury River
to Mount White portion of the Sydney-
Newcastle expressway furnished the
trouble spot. A conventional method
proved inadequate, so more costly
methods had to be used.
Keith Morris has put penalty claims
before the NSW Department of Main
Roads.
Lysaght’s Progress
Tohn Lysaght could conceivably return
to 1962 earning levels if directors’
forecasts of improved conditions come
true in the current half year. In an
interim report, which disclosed a 50 p.c.
profit lift in the six months to June,
they said business was very active in
both the manufacture of raw material
products and building products.
Half yearly profit of £1,600,000 com-
pares with about £1,065,500 in the diffi-
cult January-June, 1963, period. In the
last full year the group earned
£2,436,322, a drop of 25 p.c. on the
£3,244,949 earned in 1962.
Sales tonnage in the latest half year
was 25 p.c. higher than the previous
period and reached 385,000 tons. Zinc
prices affecting the company’s coated pro-
ducts rose steeply as the half year pro-
gressed. (Prices of coated products were
raised in August to recoup some of the
cost increase). Zinc prices are well below
the peak of a few months ago, but are
still above the price on which the in-
creases were based.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Transition of a Common Carrier
Per mew an Wright’s altered market status
llTith the 1963 annual report of Per-
y mewan Wright Ltd there is a book-
k entitled “A Century of Service”. This
'ooklet contains an extremely well
Written and therefore intriguing history
if the company. The Sydney Stock Ex-
hange Investment Service still describes
he company as “general merchants,
jroduce merchants, station suppliers”,
•et it is apparent that in terms of sales
-alue, retail grocery is now the major
tart of Permewan’s interests. What a
Iramatic transition for a common
carrier!
Currently the shares are selling at
16s. 6d. and for some few weeks they
lave appeared to have a ceiling at about
7s. At this latter price, the dividend
field is 3.7 p.c. and the earnings yield
7.4 p.c. Six years ago the shares were
peed to show a dividend yield of 8.2
51,c. and an earnings yield of 11.6 p.c.
to the company at that time had just
jlited the dividend rate to 12+ p.c. from
reduced rate of 11 p.c. in the
(previous year, it is perhaps understand-
able that the dividend yield should be
high at that time. One cannot deny,
however, that the market status of the
stock has changed quite dramatically in
recent years. It is rather difficult to
believe that this change has taken place
solely because the group has expanded
into the highly competitive field of
retail grocery.
Nevertheless, it does seem that for
some reason the group’s situation has
changed from one of decline (in real
terms) to one of growth since it acquired
the then ailing Grocery and General
Stores. In the decade from January 31,
1951, to January 31, 1961, sales value
on turnover was disclosed in approximate
terms in seven out of ten years. Bearing
in mind the price inflation that occurred
during this decade, the following picture
can only be described as unimpressive.

1961 7.4 111 1.5
If we look at the last ten years and
compare the sales figures, where we have
them, with net profit before tax, deprecia-
tion and interest, it does become apparent
that a change has taken place over the
last three years.

1962 17.0 503 3.0
1963 18.0 688 3.8
1964 21.4 906 4.2
These figures only tell what could
have been guessed. That is, grocery
retailing is also a low margin operation
and the acquisition of G. & G. did not
immediately prove beneficial. We must
assume that Permewan’s management
has worked hard to bring the profit
ratio back to a level which they had
achieved in 1961. In doing this they also
appear to have achieved a worthwhile
increase in sales, although the position is
somewhat obscured by other acquisitions
which have been made since the G. & G.
purchase.
Currently an offer is being made for
Petries Holdings. Assuming that this
offer is successful, the issued capital of
Permewan Wright will increase by
£125,000 to £1,681,140 (providing that
no further shares are issued to cover the
cash content in the offer of 3s. for every
two Petries Holdings shares). If Per-
mewan’s should have needed to finance
the cash portion by a share issue at, say,
15s. 6d. a share, then the earning rate
from Petries would be slightly less than
the current earning rate of the group as
at March 31, 1964.
Basically, then, it seems likely that the
1964-65 earning rate will not be pre-
judiced by the Petries acquisition and the
sales budget for the original group for
that period envisages an increase of 12
p.c. on the 1963-64 figures. On the basis
of the record over the past three years,
this should produce a more than com-
mensurate increase in earnings. How-
ever, there will be some factors which
v/ill tend to offset this. Firstly, it seems
likely that the interest charged on
registered notes and deposits and fixed
term loans could increase, and secondly
the rate of company tax has been in-
creased. Unfortunately nothing is known
at this stage of the profitability of the
other acquisitions, apart from Petries
Holdings, which have been made during
this current financial year. A very con-
servative estimate would suggest an in-
crease in per share earnings of 10 p.c.
based on the total capital now issued and
without allowance for the fact that some
of this capital will be non-productive
for six months of the year.
This means that the shares are cur-
rently being purchased at about 12 times
earnings, or at an 8.2 p.c. earnings yield.
Looking at the record of this factor over
the last five years, one would suggest
that, despite the fact that the share price
has increased by 30 p.c. over the last
twelve months, the shares are still by no
means overvalued.
It remains to be seen whether the
benefits of increasing earnings will be
passed on to shareholders. The current
dividend rate of 121 p.c. is the highest
the company has paid since 1928 and so
far as can be seen there is no record
of any bonus issues during this period.
Issues to shareholders have usually been
made at a premium. As at the late
balance date, the share premium reserve
represented about Is. 7d. per issued
share. If the revaluation reserve is in-
cluded then there is scope for a l-for-2
bonus issue. It would seem that, even
maintaining the 12+ p.c. dividend rate,
the earnings cover would be 1+ times.
However, even disregarding these pros-
pects, which can only be conjectural, the
current yield of 3.7 p.c. is not unattrac-
tive in the light of the record of recent
years.

Did you sell your C.S.R. and Mount Isa in time?
And your Ansett, Associated Pulp, and Waltons?
Will they fall still further?
Which stocks will be the next to fall?
Aren’t some of them about to rise?
Trendex calls attention to coming moves in stock prices.
Trendex points out what the price of a stock is going to do not just what it “ought” to do
and Trendex is usually right.
WHAT TRENDEX IS:
Have you noticed that there is never a
shortage of explanations for why a part-
icular stock has fallen or risen? Have
you noticed that your broker or news-
paper can always give you reasons why
the market is falling, or is quiet, or has
risen? In fact, usually you can select
your own reason from half a dozen
which are offered if you shop around.
There is also no shortage of suggestions
■as to what “the market’’ will do next
to be followed by still more reasons when
it happens to do something else instead.
Market price movements are not just
based on economic forecasts and com-
pany performance. They are caused by
the action of Buying Power and Selling
Pressure in the market forces which
vary in strength from time to time. That
is why the prices of stocks like 8.H.P.,
Mount Isa, H. C. Sleigh, and A.O.G.
vary so much. It follows that the best
way of estimating how the price of a
stock will move, is to gauge the strength
of Buying Power and Selling Pressure
for that stock in the market. This is ex-
actly what Trendex does. Trendex is
concerned with what is going to happen
- not with explaining away what has
already happened.
Trendex is a method of market timing,
based on market action itself. It sifts
out what is actually happening in the
market from the wishful thinking and
economic guessing that is thrown at you
wherever you go and whatever you read.
You can apply Trendex for yourself
if you can read and can think. All the
methods of Trendex are fully explained
in our book “Forecasting Australian
Stock Prices with Trendex”, sent free
to all Trendex subscribers.
C.S.R. : has fallen heavily, and is al-
ready 15/- below its peak. Subscribers
sold on the Trendex signals which an-
nounced the coming fall just as they
did in 1961 when C.S.R. began to plunge
downwards to half its former market
price. Has the fall now finished? How
far will it go? When will C.S.R. start
to rise again? As in 1963, Trendex will
signal when it is time to buy again.
MOUNT ISA: topped out recently
on clear signals, and Trendex advised
sale last month at 46/11. We have been
in and out of Mount Isa several times
in recent years. Trendex subscribers
sold at 70/- in 1962, bought around 65/-
in 1963 (equal to 26/- ex-bonus), sold
again at 39/-, bought around 34/- and
now have sold again at around 46/-.
Where do we go from here? Is the fall
over, or is the worst yet to come for the
shares of this wonderful mine? Mount
Isa is one of more than a hundred stocks
appearing in the Trendex Action Table
each week. The Action Table states
clearly just what the current market
signals are. Trendex does not make fore-
casts about stocks and then conveniently
forget them. They are followed up, week
after week and with positive action
recommendations. Trendex does not
hedge.
ANSETT: was recommended as a buy
at 5/2 (4/11 ex new issue) nearly two
years ago, when it had few friends. We
predicted a rise to 11/- (10/9 ex issue).
Ansett didn’t quite make it. The peak
sales were at 10/5, and recently the
selling signals began to appear in the
market action, and were noted in Tren-
dex. After Ansett reaches bottom, we
shall buy it back again, and shall have
more shares for the same money.
ASSOCIATED PULP: began to
lose its friends in the market after we
sold around 55/- in 1960, and they were
quite scarce when Trendex advised buy-
ing again at 32/- last year. By the time
everybody was on the bandwaggon again
at peak prices early this year, the sell-
ing signals were appearing again. Tren-
dex subscribers baled out at 39 3. When
Associated Pulp (eventually) bottoms,
it will be time to buy back again.
WALTONS: was relinquished by
Trendex subscribers at 17/- early this
year. After all there’s no future in hold-
ing on and telling the market that the
shares should rise, when they clearly
are going to fall. If you prefer saving
your money rather than throwing it
away on lost causes, let market action
tell its story through Trendex methods,
and then act on it. Waltons will again
be a good stock to buy when it finally
bottoms out.

For Genuine Investment Only
Stokes (A’asia) in stable, healthy growth
rpo most investors, the name Stokes
* (Australasia) Ltd brings to mind
jthat historic Victorian-based manufac-
turer of badges, medals and silverware.
/Although such items were the basis of
the firm’s activities in its early years, such
is not the case today.
In fact, they play only a minor role
in the overall picture of things. Four
other fields of production are much
more important. The first of these is
(the metal stamping and pressing section.
Much of its output is in the automotive
components field, mainly for Holdens,
Fords, VWs, and now the Chrysler
people—items like horn emblems, dash-
board panelling and hub caps. Com-
ponents are also turned out for the
[domestic appliance industry, serving big
( customers like Kelvinator.
Second, the company runs a foundry
[out at its Brunswick (Melb.) works. It
produces all types of non-ferrous cast-
ings. Third, we have the important
( siectrical element production (mainly for
domestic stoves) which contributes a
f large portion of the overall business.
Elements are supplied to leading stove
manufacturers in both Australia and
New Zealand.
Last but not least is the wide variety
of products manufactured and distributed
as what the directors call “proprietary
lines”—an extensive range of color
anodised-aluminium ware, electroplate
and silverware, fire extinguishers, and a
variety of items for the building indus-
try. Two new lines just introduced are
a ball-valve, which appears to have ad-
vantages over anything on the market
at present, and a lavatory flushing system
which is operated by foot from a button
on the floor.
for the electrical elements and
a small enamelling section, all manu-
facturing is done at the Brunswick
works. The new factory, close to
Heatherdale railway station out in the
Ringwood area, handles the other items.
Eventually, all activities will be centred
out there. Exactly when will be partially
determined by the sale date of the Bruns-
wick establishment, which is now on the
market.
When the move is completed, certain
economies should be affected. To start
with there will be a sizeable capital gain
made on the old factory and it is cheaper
generally to operate under one roof
than two. The sale proceeds will enable
rapid expansion at Ringwood, where a
modern, efficient layout should enhance
productivity and provide considerable
advantages over the cluttered set-up at
Brunswick—the company has been using
these premises since 1936.
The history of this third-generation
family firm can actually be traced back
to 1856, when Thomas Stokes, after an
unsuccessful search on the Victorian
goldfields, returned to Melbourne to set
up business as a die-sinker to make use
of the training he had received in Eng-
land. He prospered, mainly because of
the token coins he issued for traders to
use as legal tender in an effort to over-
come the small-coin shortage. Eventu-
ally he graduated to silverware produc-
tion.
Tn 1888 he moved from Collins Street
to Caledonian Lane and, in 1911, the
partnership between himself and his
three sons was replaced by a proprietary
company, Stokes and Sons. The two
world wars acted as catalysts to the
group's development, because of the de-
mands which were made on its existing
products and the fact that it was forced
into fields of manufacture which it had
previously known little about. Buttons,
badges and insignia for the armed
forces kept the firm flat out in World
War 1. World War II saw it producing
millions of eyepiece rims for gas masks,
bronze casting for aircraft and naval
guns, shell components and other muni-
tions. Buttons, etc., were left to smaller
concerns.
The war demands on production, and
on the ingenuity of the management, are
probably the two biggest factors lying
behind the remarkable degree of self-
sufficiency which the company has
achieved today. Some of the specialised
machinery used has been developed by
the company itself. In fact, a recent
visit from an American associate resulted
in some designs being taken back to
the States. Nearly every product was
self-inspired, with the help of local
demand, of course.
The range of electrical elements was
developed to cater for the local scene,
after an element under licence from
America had first established the group
in that field. These elements probably
offer the company its biggest growth
potential as far as sales are concerned.
The very small portion of the stove mar-
ket held by electricity, as compared with
gas, can’t help but grow as the years
go by, unless natural gas becomes avail-
able in quantity as a cheap fuel, as it
has in the US. In south-eastern Aus-
tralia, where population is most con-
centrated, this possibility seems unlikely
at present.
The relatively stable demand situation
which envelops the majority of pro-
ducts is the obvious reason for the com-
pany’s steady financial history of the
ppst. Gradual, well-based growth will
be the trend in future, too. Directors
recognise the dangers of placing too
much emphasis on their connection with
the fluctuating automotive industry. They
intend to maintain a balanced and well-
spread production, which, they hope, will
enable the offsetting of any recessions in
any sector of their business from time
to time.
steady nature of the business, com-
A bined with its extensive history and
the many long-standing traditions within
the firm, are all reflected by the con-
servative manner in which operations
are run. This, in turn, makes the shares
suitable for the genuine longer-termed
investor only. Stock markets have
sensed this already. Since the 10s.
shares were publicly listed in October,
1962, prices have moved gradually
higher as the chances for a capital issue
improved and the prospectus estimates
were confirmed.
But the upward trend has never
reached a stage where the yield from the
8 p.c. dividend became meagre. Re-
flecting the company’s future role as a
steady dividend payer and an occasional
issuer of new share capital, the yield
has always been W'ell above 4 p.c. Only
recently, since the announcement of the
one-for-four premium issue, has the
yield come down close to 4 p,c. Even this
has come about via a very small turn-
over.
The new 10s. shares are to go out at
a 3s. premium. Paid capital will rise
£lOO,OOO to £500,000 and £30,000 will
be collected in premiums. The fact
that speculators are not interested in the
company, and .the fact the directors and
their families will be maintaining their
75 p.c. interest, will prevent any great
fall back in post-issue prices. For the
genuine investor seeking security,
steady dividends and occasional capital
issues or, alternatively, gradual dividend
lifts, the shares would be good buying
now or after the issue.
The £130,000 raised will be used to
give working capital a shot in the arm
(it has gradually declined since listing)
and for expansion. Around £42,000
was spent in 1963-64 on new buildings
and plant, and the Ringwood factory
will be seeing similar expansion this

year. Profit should rise steadily this year.
It remained static in 1963-64 at
about £60.000 and would have shown a
more definite lift but for the new com-
pany tax. Earning rate managed to gain
from 14.9 p.c. to 15.1 p.c.
As the company increases profits only
gradually and as the full benefits of the
new capital may not be apparent for
some time, earning rate could ease back
slightly this year. Nevertheless, it will
still provide a more-than-adequate cover
for the 8 p.c. dividend which directors
expect to continue on the higher capital.
The table illustrates the stable, healthy
growth so far. It will undoubtedly grace
Stokes and its shareholders for years to
come.
BENNETT AND WOOD LTD
An Improving Status
"Oennett and Wood Ltd showed the
benefit of its recent move out of the
centre of the city to new premises at
Zetland and some changes in its branch
stores by turning in its best performance
for six years in 1963-64.
The current year has opened on a
strong note. The company appears to
be well on the way to reaching the
esteem in which it was held when it
floated with an issue of shares at two and
a half times face value.
Bennett and Wood began operations
in 1882 selling bicycles and accessories,
but has since moved into the field of
motor parts and accessories. It still has
a big business in Speedwell cycles, though
this now represents only 6 p.c. of the
company’s turnover.
By far the larger part of its activities
is connected with meeting the needs of
the motor and garage industries, with 84
p.c. of its turnover coming from this
source during the past year. The remain-
ing 10 p.c. comes from motor - cycle
business.
Operations take place through branches
at Goulburn, Newcastle, Tamworth,
Orange, Wagga, Parramatta, Wollon-
gong, Lismore and St Leonards, as well
as Canberra and Brisbane. The Orange
branch was destroyed by fire during
April, causing disruption to trade in the
western part of New South Wales. How-
ever, new premises are being built on an
improved site.
The biggest move the company made
in recent years was late in 1961, when
the store in the centre of Sydney was
sold and the business moved to Zetland.
This resulted in greater efficiency, despite
a sizeable reduction in staff. An elec-
tronic computer is being installed to give
even greater management control.
Already the effects are evident. Sales
for the latest year were up 8.1 p.c., or
£290,993, to £3,898,560, continuing the
upturn begun in the previous year. Bad
debts were kept to a minimum, while
stock redundancy was negligible.
The current year has begun w'ell, with
sales already ahead of those of the corres-
ponding period of the previous year.
Reflecting the improved turnover,
profit for the latest year to June 30 was
£63,092, equal to 11.2 p.c. on capital—
the best result since 1957-58. On a com-
parable basis, it is more than twice the
£35,572 earned in 1962-63, for this came
from a 16-month period following the
change in balance date from February.
Dividend for the latest year was 8
p.c., well covered by earnings, while the
8 p.c. paid for the previous period was
equal to 6 p.c. on an annual basis. Tax
provision for the latest year was only
£3OOO, because of the £81,505 loss in
1961-62. Depreciation was virtually
steady at £32,035.

a bank term loan of £89,514. Neverthel
less, with its improved status, the com- 1
pany should have no difficulties in meet-
ing these payments.
In order to assist in financing the ins
creasing trading volume, directors are
considering the sale and leaseback of
certain branch freeholds. Group free-
hold appears in the books at £789,554,
made up of valuations at 1955 with sub-
sequent additions at cost.
The shares are currently selling at 12s,
less than half the placement price and
considerably below assets backing. At
this level, they appear good buying.

JOHN McILWRAITH INDUSTRIES LTD
Good Long-term Prospects
f %OHN McIL WRAITH INDUSTRIES LTD is
obviously ready for a bonus issue.
55jt is not surprising to find the market
repricing the ss. ordinary shares at four
limes par.
.1 The last bonus issue, and in fact the
'(only issue to shareholders since listing,
a ‘a/as a one-for-four in March, 1960.
j However, with capital reserves almost
equal to paid-up capital, the ability to
)I! make a one-for-one bonus is obvious,
ir although at this stage earnings would
shave to be built up considerably to
justify it.
, The company’s business actually dates
back to 1854 and has been concerned
r with the manufacture of builders’ and
n plumbers’ supplies, sheet lead and lead
u pipes for acid plants and chemical fer-
tilisers.
If Paid-up capital prior to flotation was
ir£l million in two million 10s. shares.
|in March, 1951, certain shareholders
,/placed 500,000 shares with the public at
,16s. Bd. to enable the company to qualify
/as a public company for taxation pur-
poses and to obtain stock exchange
isting.
\ Since then, capital has almost trebled,
i- principally by takeovers. The first was
e the acquisition of Sydney-based Mc-
ifllwraith Industries Pty Ltd. This
‘ brought the group actively into the field
1, of manufacture of cast-iron enamelled
• baths, sinks, basins and copper boilers.
Expansion has been rapid, with take-
overs of allied industries in all States.
I Most of the takeovers were effected by
l share issues, usually at a premium, which
have lifted paid ordinary capital to the
present £2,804,828. The 10s. shares
were split into ss. units in September,
1960.
In the same period, the share premium
reserve has risen to £2,065,778. Other
capital reserves include an assets revalu-
ation reserve of £276,795 and a capital
profits reserve of £34,620.
At the same time as the growth in
these reserves, the intangible item of
goodwill on consolidation has also risen
. rapidly and now stands at £2,079,244,
with general goodwill standing at
£90,040. Net assets backing of each ss.
share is 10s. 3d.
The 1964 financial year was one of
consolidation, for no new takeovers were
made during the year. The spell was
Welcome, for profit in the two preceding
years, although sizeable, was well below
the peak 1961 financial year.
Profit for the latest year came out at
£740,835, equal to 26.4 p.c. on capital,
compared with £617,094 (22 p.c.) in the
previous year. The company’s peak
year was in 1961, when profit was
£752,787 (29.4 p.c.).
The dividend payout required
£420,724, leaving £320,111 to go to
reserves. Profit remained after lifting
tax provision, at the new rates, from
£384,873 to £475,644, while depreciation
was virtually unchanged at £163,624 (up
£2096).
The company had to accept lower
profit margins because of higher costs of
some raw materials, particularly brass
and copper. Wages were also higher
and the company had to meet the cost
of an extra week’s annual holiday for
employees and ' increased long-service
leave benefits. The generally competitive
trading conditions prevented the recovery
of more than a part of these costs in
selling prices.
The accounts at balance date of
June *3O reflect the buoyant conditions
enjoyed by the company. Stock is up
from £3,330,897 to £3,588,430, while
debtors are £361,430 higher at
£2,239,035. Trade and sundry creditors
are up by £255,580 to £1,026,236.
Land and buildings are in the books
at £2,824,821, subject to depreciation of
£25,514, at 1962 valuation with addi-
tions at cost of £713,447.
The trend of working capital has
moved steadily upwards, with current
assets at June 30 almost three times cur-
rent liabilities.
The shares are currently selling
around 20s. to show a dividend yield of
3.7 p.c. As the chairman points out in
his review, it takes several months for
the level of building approvals to affect
sales of the group. The current year,
therefore, should be a particularly suc-
cessful one, bringing much closer the
likelihood of a bonus. The company
offers considerable long-term prospects.


A Lot Of
Hot Air
Not much could be done about it, once.
Now it is being moved by the TON.
People have really grown to like fresh
air. They all want better air conditions
free Trom smoke, odours and stuffi-
ness. Ever since man developed the art
of trapping air in rooms, things seem to
have got out of hand. A good cool
draught is usually a welcome phrase in
either shade of meaning and a controlled,
forced air draught through any building
will usually lower temperatures, remove
all stale air, smoke, cooking odours and
the like and replace continuously with
clean, filtered air. The wonderful thing
is that it can be done for such small
cost.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Try Mining for Kicks
If industrials are too “square”
investors finding the industrial
J market too “square” should try the
mining market for kicks The oil market
is having its best run for some years.
One of the most spectacular stocks has
been Transoil. In its short life of three
months, the price has almost tripled.
Metals also deserve a mention.
Copper and tin have been the stars —■
world prices of both metals being about
70 p.c. above levels one year ago. Tin
shares have gone in and out of the port-
folio regularly during the last year At
the moment, Tableland Tin and Aber-
foyle are holding their places. Pity
there wasn’t also Renison, for its share
price jumped 6s. in the last couple of
days.
Only a short while ago, the world tin
price of £stgl2so per ton seemed high.
Now it’s £stglsoo and there’s apparently
no stopping it.
It was too frustrating, standing on the
sidelines. So I plunged into a small
purchase of 500 Ardlethan. Let’s hope
this is more successful than my last
experience with that corrmany. After
some initial production difficulties, the
company is now operating at a profit and
this could well be a deciding point.
I’m the first to admit that there’s con-
siderable risk on this transaction. But
I can hardly lose on taking up 400
Associated Portland Cement in the float.
The public issue of three million shares
has been snapped up. It is this general
interest which must bring the shares on
the market well above the 12s. place-
ment price.
Hidden behind the magic of the name
is a very average estimated earning rate
of 12.8 p.c. for the 1964 year. Ad-
mittedly. directors hope that the earning
rate will be higher in 1965 and 1966.
Even so, the present 5 p.c. earnings yield
is unlikely to set the place on fire. Given
a few months on the market, a more
sober assessment will probably be made
and the price could then drift below the
12s. level.
My last purchase this week was also
a newcomer to the stockmarket. This is
not to say that Sydney Mutual Insur-
ance is a new company. Its history dates
back to 1916, when it was formed to
underwrite workers’ compensation in-
surance in the timber industry. Although
workers’ compensation insurance is still
the single most important activity, all
other classes of insurance except life are
now handled.
Apart from a large investment port-
folio (which has a book value ,
£1,194,053 compared with a marl?
value of £1,629,670), the funds are all
used by a finance subsidiary. The to*
amount owing by hire-purchase debtcf
is just over the £800,000 mark. Directoi
have trod most carefully in this delict
field and, as a result, bad debts hat 1
been very small.
On the old capital of £250,000, can 1
ing rate showed a steady build-up ;
38.5 p.c. in 1962 but weakened slight!
to 34.2 p.c. in 1963. Although earning ■
were running at an annual rate of 54 p„ 1
for the first six months, profits at 1
always very much higher for this ha!
year. The full year’s figures should shot 1
that profits are on their upward patj
again. The 1963-64 result should bj
announced very shortly. j
With stagging going on, the 10*
shares have stayed around the 32s. sinci
listing. Some fall-off in the supply anj
a return of interest in insurance share
generally could see these shares movt
smartly to 40s. I bought 200.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
War Ahead for Apples
The mounting tide of production
If any Australian export commodity
can be said to be living on borrowed
time, it is surely the export apple in
the United Kingdom.
Until de Gaulle removed it two years
ago, there was the threat of Britain
entering the European Common Market
and being flooded with cheap Italian
fruit against which not even the local
product, let alone imported apples from
the other side of the world, could com-
pete.
When that receded, its place was taken
by an equally ominous prospect —a pro-
duction explosion that would put so
many South African and Argentinian
apples into Europe in the next few years
that Australian apples would find it
impossible to withstand.
t Nor was the short-term outlook as
rosy as the apples. It was only last year
that Australian Granny Smiths disgraced
themselves by arriving in Sweden with
bitter pit and in Germany over-ripe.
Now, twelve months later, with their
reputation stained, they were to face the
market in the wake of what has since
turned out to be an all-time world record
apple production of more than 15
million tons. Almost every country in
the northern hemisphere except the
United States has had a bigger harvest
than in the year before.
Despite the delivery this season of a
million more cases of apples to the
British market, Australia has succeeded,
in the UK and on the Continent, in dis-
posing of a record quantity of almost
eightmillion boxes at above-average
prices.
Among the factors responsible for this
was a compensation scheme introduced
to satisfy claims of the kind that poured
in from Swedish and German buyers last
year. Importers were impressed with the
Australian Apple and Pear Board’s
action in setting it up. So were Aus-
tralian growers, who saw from the
cheque-book end of the scheme the need
for safeguarding quality in future.
Partly as a result of this, the standard
of Australian apples on European
markets this year is the best for a long
time. Indeed, officials say there is not
much more the grower can do towards
improving his fruit at the tree.
Another thing that helped Australian
apples was the situation at the docks.
The dockers, who have in the past
exasperated Australian fruit officials
with their rough handling of consign-
ments and their strikes, this season in-
advertently did the industry a service. A
series of go-slows on the wharves during
the delivery period took place at a
tempo which, while not enough to cause
serious delay, “rationed” our fruit onto
the market in such a way that prices
remained above average throughout the
season.
What also helped Australian apples
to bounce back vigorously from last
year’s setback was the credit that has
accumulated from promotion—-in con-
junction, of course, with the rising
affluence that has made it possible for
consumers to respond.
Large sums are spent each year on
stunts, advertising and exhibitions.
industry has been able to harness to
its cause the British dental profession,
which treats children to such a profusion
of pro-apple propaganda that it would
not be surprising if the next generation
of Britons ate nothing else. The marvel-
lous thing is that this dental publicity
costs the industry nothing. Even pop
singers let themselves be advertised eat-
ing apples, giving their services free in
the cause of the national tooth. Aus-
tralian officials rejoice quietly in the
background, keeping their fingers crossed
in the hope that this exquisite publicity
will continue to look altruistic rather
than commercial.
However, an apple war is looming.
Neither the growing of perfect apples,
nor the provision of funds to compensate
buyers for the imperfect, nor the un-
paid services of dockers and dentists
will be enough to ensure survival for
Australia.
In the past four years, supplies from
the southern hemisphere countries (Aus-
tralia, New Zealand, South Africa and
the Argentine) have increased by seven
million cases. Europe’s own production
is rising fast. In three years, South
Africa’s volume of exports to Britain
has grown by more than half a million
boxes. By 1970 her current year’s
delivery of 2f million cases is expected
to have swollen to about four million.
Against this mounting tide, Australia
will have to sell an additional 25 p.c.
of fruit from trees that will reach
maturity within the next few years. The
Argentine is equally menacing on the
Continent.
One of the loudest complaints against
Australian fruit in Britain this year was
prompted by over-ripeness of Worcester
apples, mainly from Tasmania. Un-
fortunately, the Worcester is the first
apple of the season to reach Europe
from Australia and thus makes an im-
pression that tends to be exaggerated.
There were only 46,000 Worcesters in
the season’s total of more than four
million boxes of apples, yet their failure
jumps to every merchant's lips when the
Australian crop is mentioned. The Wor-
cester having always been a difficult
apple to export in good condition, the
possibility of excluding it from overseas
sale has naturally been examined. The
answer, however, is not so positive as
might be expected.
Another variety was once in a like
position and its removal from export
turned out to be a disadvantage because
its presence on the market in the good
years proved to have been worth more
to the apple industry than its absence
in the bad. The Australian Apple and
Pear Board is considering the problem
of the Worcester and it could well
propose that future exports of it be made
only in cell packs that are pre-cooled
before shipment.
The inadvertent dockside “rationing”
that buoyed up prices of Australian
apples this season did not go down so
well with British importers. To them,
the shipping situation remains “appal-
ling”, with delays, broken schedules and
bunched arrivals. This problem the
Board is also studying. It has had years
in which to know the difficulties. Most
of the ships that bring the eight or nine
million cases of Australian apples and
pears to Europe are large. Since the
fruit forms only a fraction of their cargo
they must spend much more time on

I dreamed I was hosing the garden one hot day when suddenly
the water pressure reduced to a mere frustrating trickle. I went
indoors, turned on the kitchen tap. Water came out all right
but rusty. My wife screamed from the shower that the water
in there was scorching her. I called the plumber. He said the
pipes were corroded needed replacing urgently all of
them. He quoted me a price. The shock woke me up.
And then I smiled with relief. I had already paid the plumber
for a quick clean installation job in copper.
The bill was about the same as it would have been for any
other kind of pipes, but copper is for keeps can’t rust or
corrode ever. The water pressure’s wonderful now, and
always will be, thanks to copper. And because of our new
copper pipes our house is worth more. In short, copper pipes
mean I can now sleep easy at nights.

the Australian coast than is required
load just fruit. The problem occurs [
reverse at the other end, when it com
to unloading a variety of cargo at d
ferent ports. Attempts are being ma*
in negotiations with ship-owners t
rationalise schedules, but although iii N
provements have been made it is hai
to achieve the ideal. Wool,
is one of fruit’s arch-enemies when in
comes to shipping, for it is vastly mo lD
important to the Australian econon te
and cannot take second place to applP
when it comes to loading ships. !
At the docks themselves, the problef
of bruising continues. This has also bee 01
the subject of action from which resulP
are expected. Australia, New Zealant
Canada and South Africa have
operated in making a 12-minute filiiT
showing in humorous inoffensive cartoof’
style what happens to silly old fruf j
when dockers are a teeny bit rough witL
it. The unions have promised to sho^ p
it to every member before the neuj
shipping season L
*e
\l/'here the Australian apple crop lagfai
™ most is in pre-cooling. As apple prolr
duction has risen throughout the worldal
so have standards. These days, one of thfli
pre-requisites for excellence in applet
sent on long sea voyages across the»<
equator is the use of cell packs and pre-<
cooling. The fibre-board cartons ir*
which these packs are incorporated]
cannot, in fact, be used without pre|i
cooling, for they insulate rather thaffii
ventilate the fruit. il
The plain fact is that while
chief rival, South Africa, has kept upl
with the rise in standards to the extent
of now sending 100 p.c. of its fruit %
Britain pre-cooled in cell packs, Aus T
tralia treats only one-third of its applet
in this way. The problem is one oie
capitalisation. South Africa produces*
such a variety of fruits around the yeai]
that she can afford to invest economically]
in cool storage facilities that can copev
easily with the apple crop. Even Vic-i
toria is not badly off in this respect.
But Tasmania, where most of Australia’s;
export apples are grown, because of her
very emphasis on apple production lacks
the wider spread of output that would
make such facilities economic.
Beneath the satisfaction associated
with the disposal of this year’s apple crop
lies uneasiness at the feeling that unless
something is done soon to transport Aus-
tralian apples on their long sea journey
under conditions at least as good as
those of their competitors, it may be too
late.
The Apple and Pear Board has de-
clared as its aim the pre-cooling of 100
p.c. of Australia’s export apples. How
to achieve it is one of the Board’s biggest
problems.

Oil Flows at Long Last
Processing Victoria s olive harvest
By MARIEL LEE
An arrival in Horsham (Vic.), experi-
J ence gained in his homeland—he
t ]jas born among olive groves near Mount
paan- —made Mr Jacob (Jack) Fried-
in quick to recognise the olive-growing
tential of areas in the Victorian
, rampians and, later, round Edenhope
;the western Wimmera. Securing some
eless Grampians scrub at Laharum
orth, Mr Friedman cleared it and
“wanted his first olives in 1948. Now
fount Olive Verdalion Holdings, the
n Smpany Mr Friedman formed, and in
j°hich, as a director, he remains a force,
I] W 40,000 trees in two Laharum and
°rie Edenhope plantations.
Ul Even in 1948, Mr Friedman envisaged
*1 urgently needed local processing fac-
3)ry to cope with full production and
Attire expansion of his embryo olive
idustry. Local opposition, allegedly to
levent erosion, against which strict pre-
glitions are taken on all land cleared
ojr olives, has restricted expansion at
Idaharum, but Edenhope offers the com-
hamy wider scope. Present plantations,
esfich were bearing freely by 1956, will
bestt reach full productivity for many
e-iers to come.
k“tot, in spite of rapidly growing de-
mand from New South Wales and
elueensland, as well as throughout Vic-
uoria, for the company’s high quality
able olives, 60 p.c. of recent record crops
’sas inevitably wasted for want of a local
ijil-processing factory.
11 This factory project, strenuously advo-
%ted over the years by Mr Friedman
s nd his son Joseph, who studied olive
; filture under world authority Dr Dal-
>Wo Bertini, Professor of Horticulture
!S t the University of Florence, Italy, has
fiways had strong support, in words,
yiorsham City Council favored a factory,
Miich, when the usual three-months olive
Reason ended, could process all types of
t'Ood. So did an American authority on
sdives, Dr H. T. Hartmann, of Califor-
nia, when in Australia on a Fulbright
scholarship.
i Undeniably a factory was needed,
pen with forty pickers handling 1961’s
excellent crop, and with 300 half-bushel
cases daily despatched to Melbourne,
where Greek and Italian families bought
up to twenty-case lots for domestic use,
the bulk of that crop could not be
utilised. Though Australia was yearly im-
porting two million gallons of olive oil,
60 p.c. of later record crops also wasted.
Mount Olive Verdalion Holdings, and
Victoria’s olive industry generally, faced
possible collapse for want of a factory
to process that wasted 60 p.c. of its in-
creasing annual crop.
It seemed, too, that a long, dry
summer, by drastically reducing the
1964 harvest, might prove a final dis-
aster. But good later rains gave a splen-
didly matured crop, and accentuated the
factory problem.
Harvesting had already begun before
a building at Horsham South was ac-
quired and, pending the arrival of the
latest in imported oil-extracting plant,
improvised machinery installed. When,
in July last, that factory throbbed into
activity, two century-old granite mill-
stones from Italy, once turned by women
or oxen but now electrically powered,
expressed olive oil as, for over two
thousand years, such mills had done
wherever olives were grown.
Case after case of ripe olives were
poured into the old-type mill to be
pulped. Coir mats “pasted” with pulp
were stacked in the 250-ton press, the
oil from which, caught in trays, was
strained into a holding tank and, after
a final settling in two 500-gallon stainless
steel tanks, the oil was tinned for sale.
Six weeks after the first crushing,
Mr Friedman publicly reported that the
current record olive harvest, which, be-
ginning in March and, with the present
limited labor force, likely to last until
October, was already taxing the plant’s
capacity, in spite of the huge volume of
fresh olives finding ready sale interstate
at thirty-five shillings the half-bushel case.
The factory, he added, was now work-
ing up to eleven hours a day, but, even
if sufficient labor could be recruited to
work a twenty-four-hour day, it still
could not meet the insatiate demand, par-
ticularly locally, for its oil, currently
selling at £3 per gallon. With olive oil
consumption, locally and elsewhere in
Australia, rapidly growing, so that great
quantities of oil must still be imported,
he had no doubt the company could as
readily, and profitably, sell all its future
peak production, which, from existing
plantations, he estimated would reach
50,000 to 60,000 gallons annually.

about NEW ZEALAND
Imagine! It’s nearer to you than most parts of Australia, yet
in looks, a world apart. It has boiling pools, spouting geysers,
glittering glaciers and lush fern forests. Vast fiords and
mountain-locked lakes where the water’s still as an oil painting.
Maori hakas...high-speed jetboats...alpine flightseeing...gentle
pasturelands. There’s something new to see and do every day of
your vacation in nearby New Zealand. And it need cost no more
than a stay-at-home holiday. Ask your Travel Agent or The New
Zealand Government Tourist Bureau'about money-saving ,Tiki
