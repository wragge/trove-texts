Geon vinyl resin. In the manufacture of life lackets, life belts and other marine wear,
Geon is a friend indeed. Tough on the job, film made from Geon withstands the
abuse of sunshine, salt water, soft water ... is wear and tear resistant. Soft and pliable,
it allows freedom of movement, is colour-fastly bright for easy “spotting”. More and

National Notebook
End of an era
"Detracing an era that had died was
hard work when its figurehead,
Sydney’s Kate Leigh, was partly deaf
and no longer in business in a big way.
In the years before her death last week,
Kate lived quietly with her nephew,
Jimmy Behan, behind his mixed store
in Devonshire Street, Surry Hills. She
was hard to see, but we won through
a few months ago with some photo-
graphs of Kate with TV star Jimmy
Hannan, one of the neighborhood child-
ren she used to befriend.
Kate sat on a sofa in a back room,
drinking beer with an old crony called
Eddie. “Don’t tire her now,” warned
Mr Behan. “She’s been up since four,
you know'.” Whatever for? “Just work-
ing,” said Kate with a wink. “I’m pretty
good for 83, but don’t you dare print
that.”
Kate remembered her early days in
Dubbo, pulling the pigtail of a Chinese
greengrocer arid stealing
his apples for distribution
among friends. “They cal-
led me Bonnie Behan in
those days,” Kate said,
and intimated she’d been
called a lot worse later
by the police. When she
wasn’t standing up to standover men,
Kate loved to play jokes on the police,
locking them in bedrooms and smear-
ing grease on benches where they sat
at night to keep an eye on her establish-
ment.
Liction brought more regrets than
fact, and the memory of Delie Stock,
the drink-sodden, priest-baiting brothel-
keeper of Ruth Park's “Harp In The
South”, still blistered. “I remember
Ruth Park working in a little shop down
the road.” Kate said, “and she never met
me once, so don’t you believe a w ? ord
of it.” Delie could, of course, have been
modelled on Kate’s arch-enemy Tilly
Devine, but it seemed wiser not to
suggest it. “Kate's never smoked or
taken drugs in her whole life,” Mr
Behan insisted. “And never tampered
with women’s bodies, either. Kate
brought me up from when I was 13,
so 1 ought to know' more than Ruth
Park.”
“Come back on Tuesday week and
I’ll tell you everything,” Kate promised,
but when Tuesday came, Kate wasn’t
well, and, in the best traditions of lost
opportunities, we never saw' her again.
Small Town
other day we took a trip to
Taronga Park Zoo, Sydney, in
company with some 50 American news-
paper owners from areas as far apart
as Long Beach and Washington, rep-
resentatives of the US National Editorial
Association. While women proprietors
instructed the sleeping koalas to wake
up and look the other way for pictures,
we talked with Theodore Serrill, the
Association’s Vice - President, w'ho is
leading the party on a quick trip around
the country which should net us a
million dollars’ worth of free publicity.
Mr Serrill, whose headquarters are in
Washington, told us that the reason
various big newspapers have folded in
the US and others have taken a fall in
circulation is the internal combustion
engine. “Because of the automobile,
people are leaving the big cities and
moving out. America is becoming more
and more the country of the small com-
munity.
“The big papers can’t possibly satisfy
the needs of those communities. So
small papers come up in the satellite
towns and suburbs. They make money
because they serve a particular com-
munity’s needs. Meanwhile
the big papers suffer, fold
or amalgamate.
“Take the ‘New York
Times’, for instance. They
tried a West Coast edition
printed in Los Angeles but
it didn’t hold out against
the local papers. On a smaller scale, the
same is true with big local papers selling
in small local areas. If I were investing in
a newspaper today I would put my money
on a small town paper in an area where
there was no competition, or on a
specialised paper. One dealing in par-
ticular needs timber, cotton, and so
on.”
And what of the big magazines?
Those which had crashed (“Colliers”)
and those which were threatened (“The
Saturday Evening Post”)? “They have
lost the formula. What they supplied
before is now supplied by television, and
they haven’t been able to find anything
new' that television can't handle. That
isn’t to include the sophisticated maga-
zines like ‘Time’, ‘Look’ and so on. They
are building.
“But the family magazines have lost
the touch, and don’t look like getting it
back.”

for children. Hodder’s do not publish
the “Noddy” books but they have the
“Fives” and “Sevens”. Mr Paul Hodder-
Williams, at present here from London,
sprang to Miss Blyton’s defence.
He was inclined to agree that Miss
Blyton’s books would not be a satis-
factory diet over a long period. He was
sure that Miss Blyton would agree with
this herself. “They are meant to bridge
the gap between being read to and read-
ing, and I think they do it very well,”
he said.
This is Mr Hodder-Williams’s third
visit here. He is not looking particularly
for new authors, although he would be
more than delighted to sight another
“Journey Among Men” or even another
writer to add to the firm’s cricketing
team of Bradman, Benaud and Harvey.
Mr Hodder - Williams said that an
interesting aspect of his firm’s work was
the publication of post-graduate technical
books. Many of these were so expensive
that often one publisher satisfied world
demand instead of selling rights to pub-
lishers in other countries. Most of these
books were in English, so that although
emerging nations often wished to abolish
English and use their native language
officially, as higher education became
more general, more and more people in
these new nations would need to know
English. And then, of course, Hodder
and Stoughton were ready with their
“Teach Yourself” books.
The Sanguine Sixties
TTelen Traubel’s career has included
singing Wagner at the Met., super-
vising Margaret Truman’s flirtation with
music, owning the St Louis Browns
baseball team, writing two murder
mysteries and undergoing a variety of
indignities in a Jerry Lewis picture.
Despite all that, she’s now sanguinely
sixtyish, and gets regular work in night-
clubs (currently, she is at the Chevron
Hilton, Sydney).
“The murder victim in my book ‘The
Metropolitan Opera Murder’ was the
prompter,” the stately and charming
Miss Traubel told us. “All the characters
were based on real people. I never could
understand the prompter at the Met.
He couldn’t speak German and he had
to prompt me in a Wagner cycle. So I
was glad to bump him off.”
She had been singing—after 21 years
solid training—at the New York Town
Hall in the late thirties when an offer
came to sing at the Met. “The Met’s
Edward Johnson offered me as my first
starring part Venus in ‘Tannhauser.’ I
told him, I am no Venus! But he insisted.
I laughed! I told him where to take his
‘Tannhauser!’ Finally I got my way. I
made my debut in ‘The Valkyrie.’”
Since the early 19505, when her
operatic career ended, Miss Traubel has
co-starred with Jerry Lewis in his pro-
duction “Ladies’ Man.” “Jerry’s a really
naughty boy,” she said affectionately.
“He’d say to me, ‘Did you learn your
scene for today?’ and I’d say ‘Yes, Jerry,’
and he’d say, ‘All of it?’ and I’d say,
‘Yes,’ and he’d say, ‘Well, you can for-
get the lot, we're not going to play it.”
When he got too troublesome, Miss
Traubel told us calmly, “I’d clump him
on the head.”
But apart from experiences like that,
Helen Traubel seemed content to enjoy
her years as an entertainer. Before we
left, we asked her which voices during
her lifetime she had admired the most.
“Caruso, Nellie Melba and Sutherland,”
she said without hesitation. “There are
no great male singers today. And there
are only three great females—Suther-
land, Callas, and Tebaldi. The reason
is that people who can sing rush into
entertainment when they are young to
make a living. It takes years, years of
practice to make a great singer.”

PLAIN ENGLISH
The Lippmann Line
/YNE of the most alarming things
about the recent French recog-
nition of Communist China was the
bluff naivete of many Australian
reactions. According to some com-
mentators, General de Gaulle is
simply recognising “realities”, as if
he, unlike the foolish Australians,
Americans and the people of most
other countries in the world, were
some sort of detached philosopher.
The fact is ignored that de Gaulle
is himself pursuing an anti-American
(and indirectly anti-Australian)
power game in a region on the other
side of the world from France and
on which French security in no way
depends. Equally ignored is the fact
that recognition, far from being a
philosophic act, is a major step for-
ward in Communist China’s struggle
for world power and a demoralising
blow to all Asian people fighting
against Communism in a year,
moreover, when Communist China
has already enjoyed important suc-
cesses in Indonesia, Cambodia,
Laos, Vietnam and Burma.
In a world which is not yet ruled
by detached French philosophers
sensibly accepting “realities”, Aus-
tralia’s survival continues to depend
on alliances with firm anti-Com-
munist Asian powers backed by the
United States. Anything that weak-
ens this arrangement, as General de
Gaulle is trying to do, is a threat to
Australian security.
Unfortunately it is not only some
Australians but also some Ameri-
cans who have approved de
Gaulle’s “realism”. Walter Lipp-
mann, however, a leading Ameri-
can commentator whose columns
are regularly syndicated in Aus-
tralia, gave the game away when
he wrote recently that America
should welcome General de Gaulle’s
“initiative” because in the long
run this will help America “extri-
cate itself honorably from the en-
tanglement in South-East Asia.”
Recognition of Communist China,
in other words, is a useful step
towards achieving what should be
America’s supreme object to get
out of South-East Asia, presumably
leaving it, and Australia, to the
mercies of the strongest remaining
power, Communist China.
Coming from Walter Lippmann
this is not surprising. For years
now, in crisis after crisis, he has
regularly recommended a policy of
appeasement abandoning West
Berlin, Quemoy, Formosa, opposing
German rearmament, regarding
Cuba as no threat to the Americas.
The significance of it is that, how-
ever obnoxious to Australia’s inter-
ests Walter Lippmann’s views may
be, he represents one substantial
strand of American public opinion.
Fortunately this is not the United
States Government’s opinion. When
Roger Hilsman, the US Assistant
Secretary for the Far East, was
asked in Sydney about Walter Lipp-
mann’s ideas of “disentanglement”,
he stated emphatically that Amer-
ica had “no intention or thought”
of disengaging from its Asian
alliances.
Australia’s future depends on
this remaining America’s view, des-
pite the naivete of Australian and
American appeasers or the power-
games of General de Gaulle.
Army Morale
TjX)UR weeks ago THE BUL-
LETIN pointed to the disturb-
ing degree of discontent among
Army officers highlighted by the
number of resignations which the
Government, in its embarrassment
and breaking with past precedents,
refused to accept. It is now report-
ed that the number of resignations,
attempted resignations, and appli-
cations for transfer to the Reserve
or the CMF in the last year has
passed one hundred that is, one
man in twenty of the whole officer
corps!
Most of the complaints and rea-
sons for wanting to resign are based
on allegations of inadequate pay,
sub-standard accommodation, arbi-
trary promotion policy, and the dif-
ficulty or impossibility of properly
educating children with frequent
postings and derisory pensions.
Without more information it is dif-
ficult for the public to decide
whether or not these complaints are
wholly or partly justified. Certainly
the fact that the officers are prepar-
ed to contribute to funds to fight
the current legal action in the High
Court to establish the right to resign
is persuasive evidence that all is not
well with officer morale. Coming on
top, too, of the publicity recently
given to the military weaknesses of
the armed services, it is clear that
the Army cannot afford any extra
burden of discontent.
There is, in other words, a strong
case for a searching inquiry into the
conditions of service of officers
in the Australian Regular Army.
It would be a fatuous policy if,
as is reported, the Government
simply plans to alter legislation
to ensure that, whatever happens in
the current High Court case, it has
the right in future to reject Army
resignations. There must be no
avoiding the issues; the reasons
for discontent and resignations
must be sought out and, if neces-
sary, wiped out. Any inquiry should
be conducted not by the Army but
by an impartial outsider, preferably
a judge.

THE LUCAS CASE
Echoes of Auschwitz
The Sydney cable
FROM A CORRESPONDENT
Z. GAWLOWSKI
A promise
VTineteen years after the war ended,
Oswiecim and Brzezinka, small
localities in the fork of the Vistula and
Sola Rivers in southern Poland, are still
inhabited by ghosts.
For in 1940-45 Oswiecim and Brze-
zinka were the site of the horror camp
of Auschwitz - Birkenau, one of the
largest extermination centres in all
Nazi-held Europe.
By all standards, Auschwitz-Birkenau
was a huge undertaking. Its barracks,
dungeons, gas ovens and crematoria
covered many acres near Oswiecim and
Brzezinka, spilling over into over three
dozen branch camps. At the peak of its
activity this death factory operated 38
“subsidiaries” in three provinces of
German - occupied Poland. The exact
number of victims will never be known,
but the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal
estimated it at “more than four million”.
For many weeks now, the horrors of
Auschwitz are being re-lived before a
German Criminal Court in Frankfurt,
where 22 former members of its SS staff
are on trial for war crimes.
The proceedings are solemn and
dignified. The defendants look neat
and prosperous, and stubbornly deny
even their knowledge of Auschwitz’s
functions. For many years they led the
lives of respectable, decent, hard-work-
ing citizens, until the police dragnet
placed them into the dock.
As the prosecution wearily piled up
its evidence, mounting figures upon
figures and photographs upon photo-
graphs, the very enormity of the crime
making its task difficult for it is hard
to imagine four million corpses—a poig-
nant human touch came from Sydney.
Mr Z. Gawlowski, a Polish - born
Enmore masseur, who was arrested by
the Gestapo for his resistance work in
Rzeszow, imprisoned in Tarnow and
then sent to Auschwitz and Matthausen,
cabled the Frankfurt Court, briefly
pointing out that one of the defendants,
Franz Lucas, a former assistant doctor
at Auschwitz-Birkenau and Matthausen,
once helped save 27 lives.
This stirred up a hornets’ nest. Sun-
day papers splashed his story with
banner headlines. Some surviving in-
mates of Auschwitz bitterly contested
Mr Gawlowski’s testimony. Still others
praised him for taking up a stand on
behalf of a former enemy. His wife,
herself a former prisoner of three Nazi
camps (she was arrested by Lithuanian
Gestapo near Wilno for hiding a Jewish
girl), told of abusive phone calls.
Why did Mr Gawlowski, who admits
he has little love for the German Nazis,
send his-controversial cable? In his own
words: “Dr Lucas helped save 27
prisoners and told us to save anyone we
could. I saw him act as a human being
in the midst of murderers. He also tried
to help prisoners in Matthausen, trans-
ferring them from the stone quarries,
which were just death pits, to the camp
hospital. It was an individual case and
I had promised to my fellow prisoners
and myself that I would make this
known if only to show to all the
murderers that a spark of human
decency pays off. I don’t know what
Lucas did before I met him, whether he
killed or saved. I want to see the
criminals punished. But I also want the
occasional glimpses of humanity con-
sidered. There were so very few of them
in the German death factories.”
What about the other Poles in Sydney?
Mr J. Suski, a journalist who passed
through the “Pawiak” Gestapo gaol in
Warsaw and the Auschwitz-Birkenau,
Matthausen and Gusen camps, pointed
out that Mr Gawlowski’s story high-
lighted an individual occurrence against
the background of mass slaughter. But
some of the worst Nazi murderers be-
haved decently when transferred to other
camps in later stages of the war, trying
to save their own skins”.
Mr B. Stefanowski, a former Polish
war correspondent, said that “it is a
notorious fact that there were no angels
among SS staffs in German concentration
camps. But even the worst Nazi
murderers might have, at odd times,
shown a spark of decency.
This was echoed by Mr J. Dunin-
Karwicki, editor of the influential
“Polish News”, which devotes two pages
of its current issue to coverage of the
Frankfurt trial. Mr Dunin-Karwicki, a
senior official of the International Tracing
Service with the US Occupation forces
in Kassel and Frankfurt in 1946-49,
said he welcomed any individual case
of decency among Nazi war criminals,
but felt that “on the whole the wheels
of justice in West Germany turn much
too slowly”
Why do so many former Nazis occupy
positions of trust and favor in West and
East Germany?
For his part, a spokesman of the
Polish Consulate-General pointed out
that “the process of bringing to justice
Nazi war criminals in the German
Federal Republic has, to date, been very
slow. A large number of former Nazis,
whose extradition Polish judical authori-
ties requested in view of their atrocities
in German-occupied Poland, have neither
been handed over nor put before German
courts. A large number of former Nazis
still work in important judicial and
police organs of the Federal Republic.”
When will the ghosts of Oswiecim dis-
appear?
THE ECONOMY
Doctoring the Figures?
“The Commonwealth Statistician should be restrained ..
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
T abor Party leaders have missed
another opportunity to rub the
Government in failing to pick the
Federal Treasurer, Mr' H. E. Holt, up
when, referring to the latest call-up of
Special Reserves Deposits, he said that
the Gross National Product at constant
prices increased by more than 5 per
cent in 1962-63, citing this as evidence
of the Government’s expansion achieve-
ments.
But before the last election the Federal
Treasurer was boasting that the Gross
National Product rose by 7.8 per cent
(from <£7,299,000 to £7,866,000) in
1962-63, and, without qualifying it in any


way, made political capital out of that
figure at a time when Mr Calwell was
saying he was going for an increase of
only 5i per cent in GNP, and the
Government itself was prepared to settle
for a growth rate of about 4i per cent.
The fact that the stated increase of
7.8 per cent was for GNP at market
prices, and not constant prices, did not
enter into the political dialogue.
But now the Treasurer has been forced
to come nearer to earth in extolling the
economic achievement last year, because
the Commonwealth Statistician has been
busy doctoring the figures he gave in
August for GNP at market prices. On
January 24th he indicated that GNP
proved to be 5.1 per cent more than the
previous year’s.
The ALP has a legitimate complaint
with both the Commonwealth Statisti-
cian, and with Mr Holt, the responsible
Minister. It can rightly say, and a lively
Opposition should have said last week,
that if subsequent adjustments to the
figures given in the White Paper on
National Income and Expenditure
(which is one of the Budget papers)
are in future likely to be of the order of
those for last year’s figures, then a word
of warning about the general use of
the figures in political argument should
be given by the Treasurer. Better still,
the Statistician should be restrained from
issuing his GNP figures until he is on
surer ground than he was in August
last year.
Mainly fathered by Mr Whitlam, the
GNP arrived as popular political jargon
in the last election campaign, but there
is obviously a need for a deeper under-
standing of the concept all round, not
least in the ALP.
NSW POLITICS
Dumping a Premier
The struggle for succession
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDNEY
R. HEFFRON
Hanging on
T>obert James Heffron, D.Litt. Hon.
(Syd. and New Eng.), D.Sc. Hon.
(NSW Univ. of Technology), and Pre-
mier of NSW since 1959, is getting a
little testy. He no longer jokes or
punches his stomach to prove how fit
he is when asked about retirement. The
cause of his touchiness is not hard to
find. The conclusions being drawn from
Labor’s debacle in the Federal election
are legion, but one of them is that the
NSW Labor Government needs a
stronger and younger leader if it is to
return to office after next year’s elec-
tions. So plenty of people are saying
that Robert James, now 73, has to go.
For his part he is making it very plain
that he won’t go voluntarily.
His case represents a common prob-
lem among democratic parties: how to
get rid of an old leader. Bob Heffron
came to the Premiership late in life in
1959, after the sudden death of Premier
Joe Cahill. He was elected largely be-
cause the so-called “Left-wing” faction in
Caucus was vociferous in its support for
him, vaguely on the basis of his radical
days in the dim-distant 19205, and as a
sort of reflex action against Right-wing
Renshaw. But he disappointed the Left-
ists. Indeed it was from the Left that
the most savage nickname against him,
“Mr Magoo”, originated.
Not a man, as he proudly boasts, for
the social life, Mr Heffron has no close
friends in the Caucus, either on the Left
or Right. Indecisive almost as a matter
of policy, under his leadership the Gov-
ernment has slowed down. Important
matters, like the TAB, take months to
come before Cabinet meetings which
drag on, often well beyond time. He is
chronically late for his appointments.
Often he does not come into his office
on Monday or Friday.
In the House he tends to ramble on,
recalling past glories as Minister for
Education or Minister for Emergency
Services in answer to questions. In an
age where cliches cloak most politicians,
Heffron throws them out as though they
were devastating retorts, although occa-
sionally the old radical has shown his
teeth, flashed into anger, and for a few
minutes reminded us that this was the
great mob-orator who led many bitter
strikes.
His failings are a standard topic of
conversation at Parliament House, but
the party machine, still scarred by the
success of the “faceless men” tag on
the Federal level, would not intervene
to force Mr Heffron’s resignation. Per-
suasion of an indirect type has been
tried, warning him of dangers to his
health.
What the move to get rid of the Pre-
mier really needs is some sign of illness
but Mr Heffron obstinately remains
healthy. While he is protected by the
fear of the electoral consequences of
deposing him, he can sit in his com-
fortable chair amidst the bric-a-brac of
his big office guarded by his two four-
feet-high plaster blackamoors, relics of
the taste of some past Premier.
Speculation, naturally enough, has
been turning to the question of his suc-
cessor. During Mr Heffron’s trip over-
seas last year his deputy, J. B. Renshaw,
moved smoothly into the Premier’s chair
and brought a competence and firm
public image to the office. Renshaw is a
country member holding since 1940 the
far North-west seat of Castlereagh, which
includes centres like Bourke, Walgett
and Lightning Ridge.
The fact that he is a country member
is important for Labor as a rural vote-
winner. Labor picked up fourteen rural
seats with carefully selected candidates
in the early 1940 s and this has been the
basis of much of the Government’s
strength. However, as these men have
retired or died Labor’s base in rural areas
has been shrinking.
Like most rural ALP members, Ren-
shaw is well to the right-of-centre. In
times when age is becoming more of an
issue in politics, Renshaw is only 54 and
has raven-black hair with only a scatter-
ing of grey.
Although regarded as Right-wing he
doesn’t carry quite as heavy a burden of
a “grouper” tag as his main opponent,
Patrick D’Arcy Hills, Minister for Local
Government and former Lord Mayor of
Sydney. Hills, who rose rapidly in the
parliamentary party under the patronage
of the late Joe Cahill, lists in “Who’s
Who” one of his hobbies as “study of
local government administration”, a
demonstration of his essential dourness.
He has the vice, for a politician, of not
suffering fools gladly and it is this that
feeds a habit of arrogance which has
made him many unnecessary enemies.
Hills, at 47, is still very young for a
politician, although he has more grey
hairs than Renshaw.
The only candidate likely to gain sup-
port for the leadership or deputy leader-
ship from the Left wing is, ironically,
not a Left-winger at all. Indeed William
Francis Sheahan, the turbulent Minister
for Health, is so much of a Right-winger
at heart that he was the only ALP poli-
tician to openly come out in support of
the Anti-Communist bill. But in the
shifting personal allegiances of the NSW
Parliamentary party over the last five
years, where characters matter more
than ideologies, “Billy” Sheahan, being
on the outer with Cabinet, has attracted
support from the opposition faction.


WORKING MOTHERS
The Seven Dead Children
of Templestowe
A lesson from the Soviet Union?
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
H. E. BOLTE
Plugs
tragic deaths by fire of seven
sleeping children has revealed
almost a state of laissez-faire with regard
to day nurseries in Victoria. In outer
suburban Templestowe a twenty-minute
blaze destroyed a weatherboard and fibro
nursery operated by a married couple.
Inside were seven children, aged between
17 and 30 months, and all from inner
Melbourne areas several miles away.
Not only had the proprietors of the
nursery failed to comply with the legal
obligation to register with the State
Health Department, but the local Shire
Secretary and two councillors admitted
that the municipal authorities were quite
unaware of its existence. It was soon
apparent that under a minimal and laxly
administered system of control, count-
less backyard nurseries were operating
in Melbourne with virtually no safe-
guards for the safety or welfare of the
children in them.
Legally, all day nurseries, pre-school
centres and similar child care organisa-
tions must be registered with the State
Health Department. This obligation,
however, can be avoided if five or fewer
children are being cared for. The super-
vision of the Health Department only
extends to the suitability of the buildings
and to making sure that there is at least
one fire extinguisher on the premises.
There is no supervision over the qualifica-
tions or character of those running the
nurseries, nor over the diet they supply.
The standards set by the Department
are far from exacting, but neither it nor
anybody else knows how many un-
registered nurseries are operating.
Until the publicity following the recent
Templestowe disaster, many operators
were unaware that they were obliged
to be registered. The Health Depart-
ment officials have admitted that they
go about their work by culling through
advertisements in suburban newspapers;
in other cases they track down un-
registered nurseries after receiving com-
plaints from municipal councils or from
dissatisfied parents.
Soon after the Templestowe fire the
Premier, Mr Bolte, announced that there
would be early legislation to plug in
some of the gaps. He promised to set
a maximum ratio of children to staff
and to increase the penalties for non-
registration.
A list which was finally issued by the
Government gave the addresses of over
400 child care centres in the metropoli-
tan area. Only 39 of these appeared to
be clearly nurseries or creches. The bal-
ance were kindergartens or play centres.
Many country towns were not represent-
ed and in Melbourne the Altona-Sun-
shine-Williamstown area did not appear
to have any nurseries at all.
While Mr Bolte’s reforms will help,
they do not appear to go near to the basis
of the problem, or even to recognise its
existence. The privately run backyard
nursery arises from the needs of the
growing number of working mothers.
Again, nobody knows how many there
are, but the 1961 census showed that
49,615 married women in the 20-34 year
age group went to work in Victoria.
Many would be mothers and there would
be others too, outside of this age group.
Clearly there are tens of thousands of
working mothers and those with children
of pre-school age would run into several
thousand.
The Health Department itself subsi-
dises 14 day nurseries in Victoria and
there would be a very few more receiving
municipal and charitable subsidies. The
number of subsidised nurseries is so
small that generally only mothers who
can prove they are in situations of spe-
cial hardship (deserted wives and wives
with husbands in prison are some ex-
amples) can get their children admitted.
The rest, the ordinary working mother,
has to make do with the private baby-
farms.
Large sections of industry and com-
merce are dependent on working
mothers, who in turn are dependent on
cheap children-minding facilities. Yet
there seems no hint that either the State
or municipal authorities are willing to
move into the field in a large way with
subsidised nurseries.
The nurseries attached to the work-
place have long been a feature of Soviet
Communism and one which its critics
have often picked on as proof that Com-
munism is the enemy of the family. Yet
mothers in Australia, no less than in the
USSR, are taking jobs. Perhaps the time
will come when manufacturers seeking a
female labor force will offer nursery faci-
lities at cost or near cost as an amenity.
On the face of it, it would appear to be
a valuable inducement and one which
would cut absenteeism considerably. For
all its associations with Communism, the
nursery attached to the work place has
much to recommend it at least in
Victoria today.
JINGOISM
ffij^ulLetCn
80 Years Ago: February 16, 1884
Tt is about time that somebody
should squelch those babblers
who are constantly sighing for a
“Greater Britain”, for a federated
Empire with an Imperial Congress
in London. They are all colonials
who talk in this way. You never find
a British statesman chasing the will-
o’-the-wisp of an Imperial Council,
or an Imperial Parliament “where the
colonies would be represented”. On
the contrary, they say, as plainly as
diplomatic language will allow them:
“You people are not content with
having continents of your own and
governing yourselves, but, confound
you, you want to come here and
govern us.” Colonial writers and
politicians with “Jingo” proclivities
are like spoilt children they expect
everything from the old people, and
will give nothing in return. They
speak of forming a homogeneous
power capable of bidding defiance
to the world, but they expect the two
little Atlantic islands to do all the
defying, and find the men and money
for it, while they look on and give
their “moral support”. But one never
hears them speak of raising 20,000
men to defend the Kyber Pass, or
£20,000,000 to keep the French out
of China. No, it is for the little
islands to do that. To have Britain,
Canada, South Africa and Australasia
welded into one power, with a general
Parliament sitting in London, or in
any other part of the empire, is not
only Utopian in conception but even
if practicable, would result in dis-
integration and disaster. They are no
friends of England or the colonies
who advocate it.

Food: Plant, harvest, and process it mechanically that’s the way
to keep abreast of the needs of an exploding population. The ways and the
means are available. For example, one man and a John Deere
Combine can harvest as much as 3,800 bushels of wheat in just 11 hours.
That equals 247,000 loaves of bread. As a major producer of
agricultural and industrial equipment, John Deere is a good company
to sell to, work for, or buy from anywhere in the world.

RELIGION
A New Reformation?
50 minutes from Dr Gough
FROM C. ASHTON IN SYDNEY
DR GOUGH
Peaceful co-existence
When Archbishop Gough called to-
gether all the clergy of the Diocese
of Sydney last week, he told the 300
(out of the Diocese's 400) who turned
up in St Andrew's Cathedral Chapter
House that they must try to break down
the “fence” surrounding the Diocese.
“There is no doubt that we evange-
licals in Sydney have the truth, e
said. Therefore we should take a
greater part in the general life of the
Church.” After making his concession
to the feeling of many S\dney clergy
that in Australia only Sydney represents
the true Church of England, the Arch-
bishop then suggested that too many
of are making God in our own
image. If the Sydney Diocese did not
take its part in the general life of the
Church, it would run the risk o
becoming like the heretical breakaway
ex-Anglican group in South Africa, an
the Exclusive Order of Brethren. The
Church needs another Reformation, he
said, and he stressed that all the clergy
—be they members of the dominant,
extreme, conservative-evangelical Angli-
can Church League, the Anglo-Catholics
or High Churchmen (a minority group)
or the liberal churchmen (neither High
nor Low) —were working “under the
Spirit of God.”
Archbishop Gough spoke for 50
minutes, and discussion followed for
nearly two hours. The three coadjutor
bishops of the diocese sat at the dais
with His Grace, but none of them took
part in the debate. Some conservatives
looked uncomfortable but the vast
majority of clergy smiled affably. All
were amazed when one of the diehard
Low Churchmen, the Rev. Roderick
Johnstone, of Beecroft, admitted he had
been called “an obsolete evangelical” and
said that, under the new Constitution,
clergy could look again at the use of
candles, crosses and vestments in Sydney
churches. (In general, Sydney regards
these as Papist and vestments for the
Eucharist are still banned by Synod.)
The tone of the meeting was one of
peaceful co-existence. Was this, as one
Sydney paper put it, Dr Gough’s first
major breakthrough for greater tolerance
among Sydney Anglican clergy? Or was
he, as some cynical clergy have
suggested, “softening them up” to face
a huge diocesan financial appeal later
in the year?
HISTORY
Operation Error
All over the city
BY M. H. ELLIS
fpHE operation of putting up 100 or so
-*■ plaques to mark historic sites round
Sydney, recently undertaken under the
auspices of the Sydney City Council by
the Royal Australian Historical Society
which appends its name to every plaque,
should be christened Operation Error.
Usually where there is a definite state-
ment on a plaque it is wholly or in some
detail wrong or hopelessly vague.
On No. 1 site the society chose to
mark the spot where the ceremony of
raising the English Colors on January
26, 1788, took place. Mr A. H.
Chisholm, the general secretary, de-
dared that the site of the taking
possession was “generally accepted to
have been midway on the Western shore
of the Cove, on the present site of
Sydney Cove Terminal.”
I protested to the City Council, as
Chairman of the Historical Committee of
the Pioneers’ Club, about this absurd
location of the flag raising which no
contemporary evidence supports and
the Council accepted in detail the plan
I placed before it for a committee
headed by a Supreme Court Judge to
settle the matter the committee, with
the Chief Justice and the Lord Mayor
as alternate chairmen, is now considering
evidence.
Nearly opposite the still vacant pole
erected to carry its designation of the
color - raising site, on the corner of
George Street North and Argyle Street,
the RAHS authorised an inscription on
a plaque saying that Francis Greenway
the architect died here in 1837 while
engaged on important work. He died, as
a dozen authorities, including the “Aus-
tralian Encyclopaedia” record, at Tarro,
outside Newcastle, in 1837, having done
no important work then for 15 years.
The plaque remained in situ for some
time and then was hurriedly taken down.
Its staff, like the one on the color-rais-
ing site across the street, is now bare.
Passing a forest of errors, half truths
and universal vaguenesses on plaques,
and equally numerous vacant spaces
where there aren’t plaques but should
be, a surveyor of Operation Error arrives
at the corner of Macquarie Place near
the Mort statue which is indicated as in
the vicinity of the first Government gar-
den. Wrong. The garden was to the east
of Macquarie Place. On the opposite
Gresham Street corner about 50 yards
from the Tank Stream and on land
20 feet or less above sea level, is a
wholly incorrect inscription declaring,
“in this vicinity was erected (Governor
Phillip’s) canvas house brought from
England in frame to serve as his
temporary home.”
We know from the scaled maps by
the two trained surveyors Dawes and
Bradley that the house stood much
further up the hill. We know it to have
been (a) 57 feet above sea level, (b) at
a spring, (c) approximately 400 feet
from high water at the east of the
Customs House on a line draw'n north-
south from near the now existing
Paragon Hotel, (d) about 300 feet from
the first permanent Government House
up the hill. This places the site of the
house on or near the site of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture Building in Bridge
Street and Loftus Street and adjacent to
the spring of water partly on the site of
that building and partly in Farrer Place
on to the south of it.
There are many other examples, but
only space here to remark on one more
schoolboy howler of a type not to be
expected from a learned society heavily
subsidised by the Commonwealth and
the dignified possessor of a Royal War-
rant: a body to which those interested in
history should be able to turn for in-
formation with absolute confidence. This
howler is in the inscription in front of
the Supreme Court Building in King
Street. The inscription on the plaque
says that the building in front of which
it is placed was designed by Francis
Greenway and completed in 1832. It
was in fact erected in the 1850 s and 60s.


Greenway had nothing to do with it—
only parts of his court house in Elizabeth
Street (completed 1828) still exist.
I have suggested to the Lord Mayor
that a move be made to create a stand-
ing fact-finding committee which could
not only review these remarkable in-
scriptions (and the vacant spots which
demand inscriptions) but as a body to
which future ascriptions might be re-
ferred for verification. This is needed
all the more because the RAHS is not
the only guilty party the National
Trust can be careless, if not so careless,
and even the Cumberland County Coun-
cil has abundant reason to blush.
BRISBANE
The Touchy
Lord Mayor
The coming City Council battle
FROM A BRISBANE CORRESPONDENT
CLEM JONES
Upset
HThe Brisbane City Council, the largest
City Council in Australia, had an-
other session of bedlam, lasting four
hours 10 minutes, when it came back
last week after a seven-week recess.
There was one big difference from the
usual weekly meetings, because this was
the first of five before the Council goes
into recess again for the May 2
triennial election.
The 28 aldermen and Lord Mayor
(all of them paid, £4O a week minimum)
take their politics very seriously and
the election will be fought just as hard
and with just as much attention to
organisation as a State or Federal
election. The ALP has 16 of the wards.
The Liberal-leaning Citizens’ Municipal
Organisation represents the other 12.
Last week the CMO leader, solicitor
Harold Crawford, claimed that top
Council officials were suffering from a
severe and powerful disease called
“Jonesitis,” and that they were either
leaving to evade it or were succumbing
to it.
The Lord Mayor, Alderman Jones,
like his opponent a small-sized man, was
upset and replied that the officials were
doing a fantastic job with the tremen-
dously increasing works programme. The
Lord Mayor, of course, blamed the
pressure of the big programme for the
strain which has resulted in several
senior officials falling very seriously ill
and in at least one leaving for greener
pastures. But part of the blame for the
animosity between senior officials and
the Labor administration does in fact
lie with Alderman Jones. He is a pro-
gressive and energetic man, but has an
unfortunate capacity for antagonising
people. The Labor administration,
which got in on the back of the 1961
credit squeeze, will—if returned—stay
there because of the extra moneys which
flowed to local authorities to cut un-
employment following the fright given
the Government in the 1961 election.
Chances at present are that Clem Jones,
46, a wealthy man who retired in his
thirties from his surveying business, will
be returned. But it is possible that he
will have a hostile Council beneath him,
for the first time in Brisbane’s history.
The DLP decision last week not to stand
could, however, help the ALP.
LAW
No Queensland Federal Judges
“Australia governed by Sydney and Melbourne ”
FROM A BRISBANE CORRESPONDENT
Queensland legal men were cheered
last week by the rumor that two
leading Queensland lawyers might fill
the next vacancies on the High Court
bench. The Bar here has been very
critical of the Federal Government
because there is not one Queensland
lawyer on any Federal Court, including
the High Court, Commonwealth Indus-
trial Court, Commonwealth Conciliation
and Arbitration Commission, and the
courts in the Northern Territory, New
Guinea and Canberra.
The criticism was sparked off by the
appointment late last month of an acting-
judge of the Victorian Supreme Court
(Mr J. A. Nimmo) as deputy-president
of the Commonwealth Conciliation and
Arbitration Commission. The last
Queenslander on the High Court was
Sir William Webb, who retired from the
bench in 1958. Commenting on the lack
of Queenslanders in Federal Courts, a
top Brisbane barrister said: “Australia
is governed by Sydney and Melbourne.
That is what it amounts to.”
But last week the Federal Govern-
ment may have seen the light. Names of
top lawyers said to be in the running for
a lift to the High Court bench included
two of the central figures in the Royal
Commission which was set up to inquire
into allegations of police misconduct
in relation to the National Hotel. The
men are the Royal Commissioner him-
self (Mr Justice Gibbs) and Mr Arnold
Bennett, QC, the State Government’s
senior counsel at the Commission.
BUSINESS
New Co. Act
A flurry in some quarters
From J. C. Horsfall in Melbourne
HHhe Victorian Companies Act got a shot
in the arm last week by the coming
into force of the Companies (Public Bor-
rowings) Act 1963, which greatly
strengthens the Act’s provisions to safe-
guard public money loaned to companies
on mortgage debenture, debenture and
unsecured notes and deposits (the only
descriptions of securities which can
henceforth be used in a statement or
prospectus inviting loan subscriptions
from the public).
A measure of the efforts of the Vic-
torian Legislature (and all other States
are expected to follow its lead in simi-
larly amending their own Acts this year)
to stop misuse of funds is that whereas
Section 74 relating to trustees in the
old Act covered only three pages,
section three in the new Act which is
substituted for it runs into nearly four-
teen.
The coming into force of the new
Act so soon after enactment has caused
a great flurry in some companies which
have been obliged to withdraw pros-
pectuses to bring them into conformity
with the new requirements. Directors
have been very sensitive to the situation,
perhaps in view of the heavy personal
penalties for breaches of subsection 3 of
section 3 of the new Act.
However, as Mr R. J. Hamer, the
Assistant Attorney-General, explained to
The Bulletin, it has been necessary to
allow some, licence to companies in
regard to the provision of half-yearly
reports. Because of the rapid proclama-
tion of the Act and also its retrospective
effect the Registrar of Companies will
not require the lodging of half-yearly
accounts for any six months period
which had expired before the new Act
came into force on February Ist.

The Santamaria Story
An Australian Disraeli?
By PETER COLEMAN
IF one had to list the three most in-
fluential personalities in Australian
politics since the war, they would al-
most certainly be Dr H. V. Evatt, Sir
Robert Menzies and Mr. B. A. Santa-
maria. Of the three Dr Evatt has al-
ready retired from politics; Sir Robert,
having dominated the country since 1949,
will be 70 this year and may shortly
retire; but Mr Santamaria, now only 48
and the most dramatically controversial
of them all, may yet have the most im-
portant phase of his career ahead of him.
The coming political term will be a
crucial one tor him as the movement for
an ALP-DLP merger swells quietly
within both parties. One of the men, if
not the key man, in any negotiations will
be Santamaria, and the key factors will
be the political price he will demand
from the ALP and his assessment of how
a merger would work. For although he
is not formally a member of the DLP
his National Civic Council is the con-
trolling influence within it, and the ALP
will have to meet him or stay “in the
wilderness” indefinitely. Rarely in Aus-
tralian history has so much depended
on one man and the loyalty he com-
mands. Remembering his “foreign” des-
cent, one has to turn to someone like
Disraeli for a counterpart overseas.
Like Disraeli, too, his job, if he is
to succeed, is to unite Two Nations—•
not two economic nations, but two ideo-
logical ones: the DLP and the Right wing
of the ALP. Few who knew him about
10 years ago when, according to his
enemies, Dr Evatt dragged him from
his secret lairs into the public gaze,
would have assumed he could ever suc-
ceed in any such reconciliation. But he
has changed a certain amount in the
past 10 years—or the movement he has
created has changed him. He has re-
cognised, if not publicly admitted, at least
some errors—notably in his unnecessary
alienation of some traditional ALP Right-
wingers; he has broadened his alliances
outside Catholic circles; he has become
more conciliatory on what he regards as
non-essentials —much more so than the
handful of DLP die-hards; and he is
certainly less likely to repeat his old
slogan “Nous mourrons de la prudence”
(“Prudence will kill us”). He has a
better chance—and with Archbishop
Mannix’s death, perhaps more need—to
succeed than at any time since the Labor
split.
What was the Bartholomew Augustine
Santamaria who first became a notorious
public figure in 1954 when, outside Vic-
toria, a startled public were unable to
see even what he looked like: the Press
had never heard of him and did not have
any pictures of him? Those who in time
did get to see him —a short, neat man
with receding hair, cherubic lips and a
concise, sometimes over-articulated Aus-
tralian voice—were even more puzzled
by his apparent ordinariness. Only his
restive, dark eyes that seem always to
be summing his questioners up, and
his electric oratory, suggested deeper or
more ambitious, possibly “sinister”, pos-
sibilities.
Melbourne Catholics were less sus-
ceptible to these ideas—even if many
of them hoped he had at last got his
come-uppance. He was well known as a
protege of Archbishop Mannix —which
in some Catholic circles did not neces-
sarily improve his standing, since many
considered Dr Mannix had had a malign
influence in Melbourne by importing
Irish politics and alien traditions into
Australia. Santamaria was also remem-
bered as a product of St Kevin’s School,
Malvern, a pre-war Catholic brains fac-
tory that prepared the brightest Catholic
boys from all over Melbourne to top
the lists in the Protestantised or secu-
larised University of Melbourne. Even
at that school he was remembered as a
young man almost literally in a hurry—
the high-spirited, earnest, amiable if
often humorless son of a hard-working
migrant, starting behind scratch, deter-
mined to catch up, striding on the
tips of his toes, dashing off brilliant
examination papers faster than anyone
else in his strange, private writing style,
relaxing only in Australian Rules foot-
ball. Once too, it was remembered, he
had been sacked from the editorship of
the school paper for demagoguery: a
keen Scullin man then, he had denounced
the anti-Scullin editor of the other school
paper (C. A. Sweeney, now a judge in
the Commonwealth Industrial Commis-
sion) in an editorial headed: “Figures
can’t lie but liars can figure.”
Later, at the University, he was re-
membered for his part in the famous
“Spanish debate” of March, 1937 a
classic pre-war confrontation between
the Left-liberals and the Catholics. Fifteen
hundred people from all over Melbourne
crowded into the Public Lecture Theatre
to hear Mrs Nettie Palmer, John Legge
and Dr G. P. O'Day denounce Franco,
while Santamaria, supporting Kevin Kelly
(now Ambassador in Argentina) and Dr
S. Ingwersen, denounced the Stalinist per-
secution of his Church. At the end of the
debate, to the disgust of the Leftists,
Santamaria and hundreds of Catholics
joined in roaring: “Long Live Christ the
King!” (“It was that cry,” reported “The
Catholic Worker,” “in the Temple of
Australian Secularism which brought the
audience to its feet in a great crescendo
of cheers. Never was the unity of

workers and students, or their loyalty to
Catholicism better demonstrated than in
the magnificent response to the cry
‘VIVA CRISTO REY’.”)
Soon after that he became Assistant
Secretary in the newly formed National
Secretariat of Catholic Action; he had
become, as it were, a professional lay
Catholic.
But if he was known to some Catho-
lics in Melbourne he was less known
elsewhere and almost unheard of among
non-Catholics.
For them the “sinister” element came
from the mixture of his Spanish-Sicilian
name and his Roman Catholicism. The
Sicilian part is in many ways the least
relevant except in terms of theories
about the Latin temperament or about
the effects of being dubbed “a dago” at
school, as Santamaria was, notably by
a Catholic priest. The family came from
the Aeolian Islands, near Stromboli,
where Spaniards had settled some cent-
uries before. His father, a shopkeeper,
had migrated in 1911 to Melbourne
where he married a compatriot (also
with a Spanish name Costa), who had
come here before him, at the age of 11, to
look after her brothers.
It is Santamaria’s boast that few Sicil-
ian families were so quickly “integrated”
as his. It is not only that the children
absorbed the Australianism that inevit-
ably results from a Catholic schooling,
but of the forty odd Santamarias now in
Melbourne, none of the second generation
married Italians and none of the third
• —mainly professional men and women—
speaks Italian. Santamaria himself speaks
both Italian and Sicilian, and he has,
he says, a sentimental feeling for Italian
music or Italian food, but otherwise he
has no particular interest in, or, for that
matter, knowledge of the Italian com-
munity here or in Italy itself. The only
time he ever went to Europe was for a
few months at the age of five (when,
he says, he introduced Australian Rules
to Sicily; he always played rover). He
has always dismissed the idea of chan-
ging his name to something that might
appeal to what he calls the Anglican-
Presbyterian Establishment (“That would
be a betrayal of everything I believe in,”
•—meaning, probably, his very genuine
sense of family). But otherwise the most
obvious effect of his Sicilian origins is
to have given him a Disraeli-like detach-
ment from many Australian sacred cows
—and to have reinforced his Catholicism.
“Crisis of Faith”?
T\f the sincerity of his religion only the
” absurdly cynical have ever had any
doubts. But it is a Catholicism of a defi-
nite type. The Santamarias are a pious,
hard-working family (he remembers his
father working in his wine-grocery shop
from 2 a.m. to 11a.m. night after night
in the depression, and although his father
once didn’t go to Mass for about 15
years, “his faith is strong”) and there
is nothing twice-born about Santamaria’s
faith. True, he has said that he had a
“crisis of faith” when he was at school,
but after reading Archbishop Sheahan’s
“Christian Apologetics” the crisis passed.
In other words there never was a real
crisis. Archbishop Sheahan was Coad-
jutor to Archbishop Kelly in Sydney
before the war, with the right of suc-
cession; according to legend his disgust
with the philistine atmosphere of Syd-
ney’s Catholicism finally provoked him
to resign and go back to Ireland (and
Norman Gilroy became Archbishop).
His “Apologetics,” once a text in many
Catholic schools, is no worse and per-
haps even better than most such books,
but most questioning Catholic youths were
sceptical of it while at school and laugh-
ed about it after they left. That Santa-
maria, one of the most brilliant Catholics
ever produced in Australia, should have
found that it answered all his doubts,
only shows that he never had any real
doubts.
There is nothing questioning about
Santamaria’s Catholicism. His mind is
averse to anything speculative—as can
be seen in the precision and definiteness
of the Bishop's statements in the 19405,
most of which he wrote. His reading,
outside politics, is mainly history, and
it was Christopher Dawson who in his
youth satisfied him that everything good
in Europe is of Christian origin just
as Archbishop Sheahan satisfied him
there are no arguments against Catholi-
cism. The issue seems to have ended
there.
Nor is there anything particularly lite-
rary about his religion. He almost never
reads novels, and he hardly read any
poetry until he came across some of
James McAuley’s political poems about
“the Movement” in the 19505. This
led him to read the rest of McAuley
his still unpublished “De Quiros” espe-
cially moved him—but otherwise he still
only reads poetry as it turns up in maga-
zines. Surprisingly perhaps, he feels his
mind is very like McAuley’s (“He satis-
fies an instinct in me”), though people
who know them both well disagree:
whereas, for example, conversation with
McAuley often leaves people with a
gloomy feeling that things will get much
worse before they get better (if ever),
conversation with Santamaria leaves them
with the strong feeling that victory is
just around the corner.
What put teeth into his Catholicism
was his experience as a student in the
1930 s at Melbourne University, in parti-
cular the Spanish Republican attacks on
the Church, the hostility to Catholicism
of the whole “progressive” world, and
the new vitality of the Catholic Aetion
movement which was transforming the
Church in Europe and reaching Australia
through the University Campion Society,
a group of militant Catholic intellectuals.
(Even then he found little interest in the
Campions’ vogue of Chesterton and Bel-
loc: they were useful as an antidote to
Shaw or Wells or Bertrand Russell, but
otherwise they were too literary for him
and their message too often seemed to
boil down to a beer-drinking bohemia.
“I had drunk wine from the age of two
in my father’s house and could never
see any emancipation in getting drunk”).
Two groups of enemies
T>ut above all, he grew up in the arch-
diocese of the late Dr Daniel Man-
nix (whose private papers he is now
working on for a biography). This was
a fateful influence not only because the
Archbishop influenced everything about
him from his political attitudes to his
writing style, but also because it meant
Santamaria inherited two groups of
enemies within the Catholic Church. The
first are those Melbourne Catholics who
from the days of the 1916-17 conscrip-
tion campaigns onwards have resented
the influence of Dr Mannix, who saw
his militant public statements as prolong-
ing Catholic isolation in Melbourne, as
encouraging a Catholic ghetto complex.
According to Dr Mannix’s supporters
these critics are simply social conformists
and careerists, usually professional men,
who want to be accepted by the “Ang-
lican-Presbyterian Establishment” and
therefore resented Dr Mannix rocking
the boat. The counter-argument to this
“smear” is that their criticisms are based
on sound theological beliefs about the
separation of Church and State, which
Dr Mannix ignored, thereby damaging
not only politics, but even religion in
Melbourne. The debate still continues
abated, but there is no doubt where
Santamaria’s sympathies lie.
A second and more formidable an-
tagonist has been the Sydney Catholic
hierarchy which always distrusted the
political techniques of Dr Mannix. Since
the days of Cardinal Moran its political
policy has been to cultivate friendships
with Catholic politicians and promote a
Catholic political elite, avoiding at al-
most any price danger of “sectarianism.”
In practice, according to Dr Mannix’s
sympathisers, this has produced a Catho-
lic elite all right, but brought no results
for the Church (except legal housie-
housie). The Sydney Hierarchy, on this
view, confuses Room 32 with The Upper
Room.
But whether or not it was partly Dr
Mannix’s fault, the Catholics of Mel-
bourne in Santamaria’s student days felt
isolated and confined despised in a

Leftist-secularist decade as either reac-
tionary intellectuals or Tammany poli-
ticians. Santamaria felt this as much as
any—more perhaps, in view of his Italian
origins. For him there seemed no allies
outside the Catholic Church, and many
traitors within it; the world was being
prepared for a struggle by good Catho-
lics against the Communists, Nazis,
atheists, and their Catholic fellow-travel-
lers; and Australians were dominated,
socially, by the Anglican-Presbyterian
Establishment and, intellectually, by the
Leftists, both of whom publicly expressed
contempt for Catholics. The Communists
were at least open enemies, but the libe-
rals whether Protestant, Catholic or
secularist—were equally dangerous: Pro-
bably thinking of Spain, he liked to quote
the Swiss historian Burckhardt: “Any
thing is possible in Europe since the
Paris Commune, because there are every-
where good, splendid, liberal people who
do not quite know the boundaries be-
tween right and wrong and where the
duty of resistance and defence begins. It
is these men who open the doors to the
terrible masses everywhere.”
It was a view of the world which left
little room for the compromise of ordi-
nary democratic politics, for confidence
in democratic processes: a crisis was ap-
proaching in which faith and dedication,
not compromise and trust, would count.
Added to all this was Santamaria’s
determination to fight the issue, confi-
dent then as he is now that he is doing
God’s work, that he must win because
God is on his side. The first issue of a
magazine he helped launch and edited
in 1936, “The Catholic Worker”, an-
nounced: “The day of the Sunday-morn-
ing Catholic is over!” The time for
militancy had 'arrived
“Capitalism is the enemy!”
At first this militancy was largely con-
fined to journalism in the pages of
this “Catholic Worker”. Even so, after
nearly 30 years that journal seems, while
militant enough, to have also been an
oddly provincial paper.
Apart from Catholic preoccupations
with birth-control and censorship of ob-
scene books, the big issue was unemploy-
ment. Certainly local Communism did
not particularly concern them: “We do
not regard the Communist Party as our
chief opponent,” he wrote in the second
issue. “We would not have wasted our
time and money to make an attack on
the petty middle-class clique of which it
is composed. Capitalism — that is the
enemy!” But is was a success and in time
reached a circulation of 70,000 and even
got a letter from Hilaire Belloc saying
that, although the struggle against the
Servile State was lost in England, there
was still hope in Australia.
After a few months, however, Santa-
maria left the paper and found his first
full-time, paid job as Assistant Director
in the National Secretariat of the newly
formed but still unorganised Catholic
Action, and his public career really be-
gan. At the same time, having a job, he
was able to marry Helen Power in Octo-
ber, 1939.
By the time the war started the scene
was laid for the drama to come. He was
a man with a doctrine, a sense of urgency
and isolation, an organisation, and ex-
perience in Catholic agitation. In the
country there was, at that time, a Labor
Party increasingly manipulated by the
Communist Party, especially in Victoria
and NSW; a trade union movement in-
creasingly dominated by Communists;
a Catholic ALP Right wing which had
spent its life in “fixes” and Tammany
manoeuvres; a declining Wren machine
that had no weapons with which to fight
those Communists who could not be
bought off with a seat on a Government
board or a union sinecure, or whose
secular religion was stronger than that
of the Tammany Catholics, and who were
even more skilled in infiltration and in-
timidation. Above all there was an Arch-
bishop with a passion for politics. These
three elements: Dr Mannix’s support,
Communist power and Labor Right-wing
decadence gave Santamaria his vocation
and his chance.
In this atmosphere in the early 1940 s
he organised the Movement a group
without parallel in the world and one
which has radically changed the course
of Australian history.
The Movement’s success and later set-
back can be summarised briefly. Laun-
ched by Santamaria and about 20
unionists from a dozen Melbourne
parishes, and linked with the Victorian
Parliamentary ALP through H. M. Cre-
mean, MLA, and with the Trades Hall
through Vic Stout, it quickly organised
throughout Melbourne’s trade union sys-
tem and soon spilled over into the ALP
machine. It worked like this: Stout would
ring Mr Norm Lauritz of the Movement
and tell him the dates of crucial union
meetings; the Movement’s members of
the unions concerned would rally, and
the Communists would usually be
“done.” At first its successes were con-
fined to small unions, but by 1952 its
success was on the historic scale: The
Communists had lost their grip on the
ACTU and most Trades and Labor
Councils; soon the great Ironworkers and
Clerks unions were freed from Commu-
nist control; most ALP State Executives
were purged of Communists and fellow
travellers. The Party had gone Right.
Then, summarising, four years later,
after Labor’s defeat in two elections and
Dr H. V. Evatt’s appearance in The Pet-
rov Inquiry, Dr Evatt, needing to rally
any support against the Right wing, sud-
denly denounced the Movement as a
sinister “outside influence,” and began
purging State Executives of Movement
men. The party split, the DLP was for-
med, and the Labor movement fell into
shambles which may last another gene-
ration.
Church facilities
elements of the crisis were already
there at the very beginning of
the Movement’s history and largely
spring from Santamaria’s personality. The
first was Santamaria’s use, or misuse, of
Church facilities; the second was his
contempt for the old style, often Tam-
many Right-wingers; and the third
really springing from these first two
his hostility to the policies of the Sydney
hierarchy.
The debate on the Church and politics
still goes on. Today Santamaria now says
that although he was throughout these
years an officer of Catholic Action—an
official church agency—-his organisation
of the Movement was independent of
the Church—just as Archbishop Mannix’s
political activities were those of a private
citizen not of an Archbishop. This may
be so, but no one bothered to make the
distinction very carefully and the Move-
ment had all the paraphernalia of an
official Church movement.
The Bishops, including the Cardinal,
were at first the most insistent that the
Movement use all possible Church faci-
lities —an arrangement they could have
terminated at any time with 24 hours’
notice. A priest was present at every
branch meeting—after the fall of China,
some of them were the escapees—and
the agenda usually included gospel dis-
cussions. Typical questions for discussion
were: “Does indifference to or defiance
of the Bishops’ wishes constitute an
offence to Our Lord himself? Give rea-
sons.” (All the Bishops’ wishes then
were clearly to support the Movement).
“Do the circumstances of the struggle
today ask of each of us a rigid adherence
to even the least important demands of
the Christian way of life? Is such a sin-
cere determination not to compromise
essential, or merely desirable, if we are


to challenge and overthrow Communism
and the things breeding it? Give reasons”
(The question would be introduced after
a reference to Christ’s verdict: “Who
is not with Me is against Me.”)
The Movement aroused colossal fer-
vor, especially after the Communists
overran China and looked like conquering
the world (“It is already 11 minutes to
midnight” was their slogan). The Catho-
lics, despised in the 19305, were taking
revenge—for Spain, for Ireland, for
years of “second class citizenship,”
buoyed by the confidence that they were
right, that they were the patriots, and
that it was their enemies, the Leftists, the
Protestants, the Masons who had let the
Communists get so much power in Aus-
tralia.
At the same time it was obvious that,
whatever was the official policy of the
Movement at the beginning, many of
its members—especially the non-trade
union white-collar workers —saw it as a
means of controlling the Labor Party,
and through it the Government, and
ultimately as an agent to Christianise
Australia. An intoxicating idea for
many, it also aroused in others a
fanaticism and intolerance that aliena-
ted many Catholics. The Movement dis-
missed critical Catholics as “unworthy
Catholics”; sometimes their private lives
were blackened.
Already many Catholics were hostile
to Santamaria, especially the group or-
ganised around “The Catholic Worker”
(Melbourne) which Santamaria had edi-
ted in 1936. Others, annoyed by “Move-
ment priests” in their parishes, began
avoiding their local churches and atten-
ding the anonymous city Church of St
Francis or St Patrick’s Cathederal.
But while Archbishop Mannix conti-
nued to support Santamaria and des-
cribe him publicly as “the savior of
Australia,” they remained powerless.
They had great hopes of His Excellency,
the Most Reverend Romolo Carboni, the
Apostolic Delegate, who was rumoured
to be determined to “discipline” Santa-
maria; but after a long conference in
Bendigo, Carboni came out as one of
Santamaria’s greatest supporters.
These Anti-Movement Catholics were
clearly powerless without the support of
ALP leaders who were not tainted with
Communism. But these were not too hard
to find. The Movement had not only
destroyed much of the Communists’
power, it had soon begun to terrify some
of the non-Movement Right wing. The
clean ballot legislation was the decisive
issue; it could destroy them as easily as
Communists; and many Rightists feared
it even more than Communists. More
significant were the honest ALP
moderates who maintained what they
called the Chifley tradition —men like
A. Calwell, P. Kennelly, E. Reece, J.
Cahill. Most of them allied themselves
with Santamaria against Communists, but
although Santamaria’s supporters now
accuse them of opportunism and gutless-
ness, their real motivation usually was,
and is, conservatism: they wanted, and
want, a traditional Australia gradually be-
ing reformed, not a radically Christianised
country in the Santamaria style. It was
the difference between conservatism and
idealism. (The irony is that later in oppo-
sing Santamaria they had to revive and
depend on the Communists.) In the early
1950 s Victorian politics was largely a
matter of the Movement’s attempt to
destroy one of these men, Patrick Ken-
nelly. Added to all this were the perso-
nal animosities that are inevitable in any
political movement —Calwell’s hostilities
to Santamaria in Melbourne, Dougherty
to Kane in Sydney, Bukowski to Gair in
Brisbane.
The Sydney Movement
TJut even despite the opposition of some
Catholics and some ALP moderates,
Santamaria was still safe —unless the
Sydney Catholic hierarchy would re-
nounce him. It was the Sydney decision
to do just this—or the Sydney “betrayal”,
from the Movement’s point of view—
which 1 brought the crisis to a head and
is said to have given Evatt the confidence
to launch his purge.
The Movement was never as secure in
Sydney as it had been in Melbourne, but
it was clear from the beginning that it
would not get very far unless it had a
powerful branch in Sydney where the
main unions were centred.
It had two starting points in Sydney
—firstly the ALP’s Industrial Groups
which the Movement supported and were
more or less able to control, and secondly
a Catholic anti-Communist group led by
Dr "Paddy” Ryan, the head of the Catho-
lic Social Science Bureau. Dr Ryan was
well known in the 1940 s for his rather
melodramatic cowboys-and-Indians ap-
proach to Communism, his public lec-
tures advertised with sketches of a beard-
ed Bolshevik carrying a bomb (sketches
which the Communist “Tribune” repro-'
duced with joy), and his love of conspir-
acy and secrecy (he had his agents trail
Communists around town to learn their
contacts). An intellectual priest, he was
still sufficiently out of touch to mix his
attacks on Communists with attacks on
free-thinkers like the late Professor J.
Anderson who at the time was, almost
alone, destroying the prestige of Com-
munism in Sydney University. At the
same time Dr Ryan was popular with
Labor’s old anti-Communist and some-
times Tammany Right wing who saw no
threat to themselves in his activities.
To Cardinal (then Archbishop) Gilroy,
who at first welcomed Mr Santamaria’s
movement in Sydney, it seemed natural
to appoint “Paddy” Ryan as its local
head—a good Sydney man to run a
Melbourne-sponsored enterprise. In the
event, although Dr Ryan sought the sup-
port of parish priests on the Melbourne
model, he didn’t get much; and besides
drawing up dossiers, having Communists
trailed around town, and running the Stu-
dents’ Representative Council at the Uni-
versity, the Movement achieved little
under his guidance. By the time of the
1949 Coal Strike, the same year as the
fall of China, reorganisation was seen
as urgent.
Soon afterwards, Bishop P. F. Lyons,
originally a Melbourne man and then
Auxiliary Bishop to Archbishop Gilroy,
was put in charge; Kevin Davis (today
Vice-President of the DLP) resigned
from the Public Service to become the
Movement’s secretary; and Dr Ryan
was “promoted” upstairs, where surroun-
ded by phones, he had little influence and
nursed a sense of grievance.
The Movement finally went seriously
into business. Communists were defeated
in major unions and within one year the
Sydney Movement had done what it look
Melbourne about eight years to do: de-
feated their most vocal opponent in the
ALP, Jack Ferguson, the NSW president.
By 1951 NSW had a Right-wing
Executive. At the same time, as in Mel-
bourne, extremists —usually not unionists
—seeing how easy it all seemed, began
taking over ALP branches and small
unions where there was no Communist
threat; once they even took over a
United Nations association. (With about
30 union and branch meetings each
night in Sydney-Newcastle-Wollongong
it was impossible for the headquarters
to keep track of everything the Move-
ment was doing.)
Then, as in Victoria, the traditional
ALP Right wing grew alarmed at the
power and determination of the new
force. They saw it as a threat to them.
Increasingly they began lobbying Cardi-
nal Gilroy, either directly or through
Premier J. J. Cahill; and the Cardinal
himself grew alarmed at the introduction
of Melbourne methods into Sydney, with
the risk of sectarianism disrupting the
Church’s good relations with the tradi-
tional Labor Right wing and threatening
the Cahill Government.
The opportunity for counter-action
against the Melbourne ideas came in 1953
when Auxiliary Bishop Eris O'Brien was
appointed Archbishop of Canberra and
Goulburn, and Bishop Lyons auto-
matically took over his duties in Sydney,
leaving control of the Movement to the
new Auxiliary Bishop James Carroll, a
known critic of Santamaria. In no time

Bishop Carroll made it clear that Santa-
maria’s writ no longer ran in Sydney.
The Movement organisation was main-
tained, but gradually the Santamaria men
were eased out. CUSA House finally be-
came an anti-Santamaria centre.
The Cross upon the wall
tT'HE scene was now set for EvatFs offen-
sive. With the old ALP Right wing
and the NSW hierarchy hostile to Santa-
maria, and Catholics everywhere con-
fused, Evatt delivered his famous king
hit. His tactics and timing seemed perfect.
He knew Sydney - Melbourne tensions
were at breaking point, he attacked
Melbourne Catholics only, giving Sydney
the chance to disengage, and he exploited
Protestant fears to the maximum.
The following months saw the historic
purges of the ALP, sackings, defections,
betrayals and ever-increasing bitterness
that affected private as well as public life;
old friends broke, never to speak to each
other again; families split; and faithful
Catholics learned a new disillusionment
in some of their Bishops.
James McAuley, the Movement’s poet
and one of the leading enthusiasts of the
DLP in NSW, caught at least one aspect
of the mood in one of his political poems:
“The hearts of men grow colder,
The final things draw near,
Forms vanish, kingdoms moulder,
The anti-realm is here
Whose order is derangement.
Close-driven, yet alone,
Men face the last estrangement
The sense of nature gone.”
Another poem written after a Move-
ment Retreat in a Sydney monastery runs;
“Soon you must return to tasks
That sicken and appal:
The calumnies will never cease.
Look only to the sign of peace,
The Cross upon the wall.”
One factor that Dr Evatt may not
have appreciated when he delivered his
attack was the relish with which Santa-
maria enjoys a crisis. He quickly laun-
ched the DLP (or the ALP Anti-Com-
munist) against strong opposition from
those who, because “splinter parties al-
ways fail”, wanted to stay in the ALP
and fight Communism there. In a dra-
matic two-hour speech to the key men
in Melbourne, Santamaria convinced
these that to stay in the ALP would mean
being reduced to complete ineffectuality;
as for the future, he quoted Napoleon:
“On s’engage, et puis on voit” (“Get
started, then see what happens”). Later
the new Melbourne party merged with
Sydney’s DLP at the Great Southern
Hotel, and later still with Brisbane’s QLP
to become a national party.
Santamaria is not formally a member
of the DLP but he is its dominating
figure (as those in the party who have
attacked his influence have learned to
their cost), but under his inspiration this
mixture of disgruntled ALP’ers, union-
ists, intellectuals, poets and priests has
maintained a solid 10 per cent of the
Federal vote and kept Evatt - Calwell
Labor out of office. It has also kept
foreign policy questions (Santamaria’s
special interest now) in the forefront of
public affairs, and it can claim the credit
for the Menzies Government’s policy of
State Aid for Catholic schools, since the
purpose of this policy was not to woo
the NSW Catholic hierarchy, which is
identified with the ALP, but to keep the
DLP’s 500,000 preferences for the Liber-
al Party.
As well as launching the DLP,
Santamaria also, despite Cardinal Gilroy,
maintained the Movement more or less
intact outside NSW, though after the
Cardinal referred the issue to Rome it
changed its name to the National Civic
Council., A commission of Cardinals
which met in 1957 to settle the matter
decided that the hierarchy should not
directly participate in politics; that the
Movement must be confined to spiritual
and moral matters and not concern itself
with trade unions; but that Catholic lay-
men should treat the struggle against
Communism as a matter of urgency. This
decision suited everyone. Cardinal Gilroy
could claim victory but Santamaria could
claim encouragement to continue his
work as a lay movement —which he did
under the Movement’s new face, the
National Ciyic Council. It has branches
now from Cairns to Perth, and even in
NSW, with Frank Clancy as the main
organiser, it has about 60 branches each
composed mainly of young men and
women. (Since the Labor split it has be-
come something like a youth movement
—probably the most well-organised and
hard-working in Australia. During elec-
tions if any booth has a man of 70 on
it, it is a safe bet it will be ALP, if there
is someone about 20, it will probably be
an NCC man working for the DLP.)
What of the future? The ALP —with
its fellow-travelling Central Executives
in Victoria, Queensland and Western
Australia, its compromises with the Com-
munists on foreign policy, its unity tickets
and “peace” fronts —is in a greater mess
than ever. Without DLP-NCC personnel
back in the Party, it has no hope of con-
taining the Left wing or of winning an
election. But if the need for such a
merger is now openly recognised, there
is no point in over-estimating its chances
of success.
The diehards
Tn some quarters of the ALP, hostility
is so deep and bitter that they would
not compromise even if they remain out
of power indefinitely. (The same applies
to a few DLP diehards who, remembering
how they were “done”, dream only of
revenge.) Indeed in Victoria the ALP
has usually been out of power throughout
its history, so another 50 years “in the
wilderness” would not particularly worry
it. On the other hand, Santamaria cannot
compromise too much either; he can
deliver about 70 per cent of DLP votes
to the ALP, but only if he can prove
to the DLP voters that they would still
be voting for the DLP.
But all the same he is obviously ready
to make necessary compromises far
more so than some DLP diehards. He
certainly regrets past errors—the “sec-
recy” of the Movement; his alienation of
the ALP Right wing (even if some of
them are mildly corrupt); his holding an
official Catholic Action position while
organising the Movement. There is less
“Catholic only” about his activities now;
the suspicious Catholic ghetto days are
passing. He has cultivated good links
with secularists, Protestants and Jews—
especially in Melbourne with Jews, some
of whose communal leaders, remem-
bering their own struggles against Com-
munist infiltration, are among his
fervent admirers. The NCC’sWNews-
weekly” has become the most intellectual,
more - or - less “Catholic”, weekly news-
paper in Australia. The Movement has
made many attempts to meet the ALP
Right wing half-way, notably in union
elections where the NCC has organised
ALP candidates’ victories. There is no
doubt that he still dreams of a Christian-
ised Australia, and that he is sure he is
doing God’s work. But he is politically
more conciliatory, and, although Labor
will almost certainly lose the next Federal
election, it may have a chance in the one
after that, if it finally comes to terms
with Santamaria.
Perhaps that will be the final irony in
the whole drama. For if Santamaria does
succeeded in merging the DLP and
ALP, what would become of his role
in the Labor movement? It is his enemies
who have made him such a dominating
figure; perhaps it is his friends who may
undermine him?

WHATEVER BECAME OF THOSE SANE DRINKERS?
A ctually, liquor in Victoria is like
the weather everyone talks
about it, but no one does anything
about it. And, frankly, we enjoy
talking about liquor more than any-
thing. We didn’t really get our
famous 6 o’clock closing until 1917.
At the time things were desperately
serious on the Somme, and someone
had the brilliant idea that if only the
bars were closed at 6 p.m. this would
win the war for us. As you may
remember, we did win that war, so
naturally we have stuck firmly to 6
o’clock closing ever since.
Yet we have tried to alter matters.
There was the Royal Commission of
1944. In 1956 we had a referendum
on closing hours: 10 p.m. closing, yes
or no. On that occasion the Vic-
torian Temperance Alliance, carry-
ing the total abstinence flag, had a
resounding victory 60.7 per cent of
the votes to 39.3 per cent for the
would-be drinkers.
Towards the end of 1959 we sent
Judge Fraser on what many con-
sidered a dretim assignment. This was
to spend four months browsing round
the pubs of the world inspecting how
others imbibed alcohol. Well, the
Judge returned, made an excellent
report, but we accepted very few of
his recommendations.
During 1962 and 1963 the Bolte
Government tried repeatedly to in-
troduce a very kindly, innocuous
liquor reform bill, which didn’t even
mention 10 p.m. closing; but on each
occasion it was rejected by the com-
bined forces of the Labor and Coun-
try Parties in the Legislative Council.
So now we are having yet another
Royal Commission. Royal Commis-
sions always were the perfect answer
to all social ills.
The Commission had its first sit-
ting on November 13, then it re-
opened for business on February 3.
Some have said, extravagantly, that
it could last for years.
If the Royal Commission looked
like being unbearably tedious it was
saved by the appointment of Mr
P. D. Phillips, QC, as Royal Commis-
sioner. Now, P. D. Phillips was al-
ways one of the most brilliant and the
most lively wigs at the Victorian Bar.
In 1958 he surprised us all by re-
tiring from the Bar and accepting a
lectureship in law at Melbourne
University. This was made possible
by a donation of £.BOOO from Mr
Stanley Korman. Somehow, 1958
seems a long way away.
So the liquor Royal Commission is
a real P.D. comeback, and the news-
papers are very satisfied with him as
a regular source of good copy. On
the first day he went to work he
announced that there would be pri-
vate consultations with all the various
bodies involved, and he added wryly
that these would be held over cups
of tea or glasses of wine, as circum-
stances permitted.
HThen he was rather good last week,
when he had a small difference
with the Rev. John Westerman. Mr
Westerman represents the Church of
England, the Presbyterians, the
Methodists, the Churches of Christ,
the Congregational Church and the
Salvation Army. He is not in favor
of an extension of liquor hours and
he pointed out that the churches
were concerned about the extent to
which young people, who w'ould not
otherwise do so. began drinking as
a result of social pressures. Where-
upon Mr Phillips shocked Mr Wes-
terman by saying that he had intro-
duced his two daughters to wine-
drinking at a very early age. Indeed,
he had the feeling that this was
guaranteeing their safety as much as
anything else.
Then again, last week he said he
was puzzled by the term “six o’clock
swill”. He actually made a tour of
hotel bars and he was surprised by the
number of places in which the phe-
nomenon did not occur. After
visiting a number of hotels he went
to a small hotel in South Melbourne
at 5.55 p.m., and he said: “I was still
in a state of sobriety which enabled
me to take stock of the situation, and
I found there were only about 20
people in the bar. Knowing that no
drinks would be served after ten past
six, a lot of people bought double
rounds at eight minutes past”.
This proved all too clearly that Mr
Phillips was not a regular swiller for,
according to the law, no drinks must
be served after 6 p.m. Upon read-
ing this, many of us felt that he had
not been to the choicest bars. We
could even have taken him to the
bar about which an American maga-
zine recently wrote: “At 6 p.m. it
had all the atmosphere of Dante’s
Inferno”.
Of course, vast cohorts of people
have lined up to give evidence
brewers, vignerons, distillers, hotel-
keepers and licensed grocers, police,
theatre owners, tourist organisations,
to say nothing of the Protestant
Churches, the Victorian Temperance
Alliance, the Women’s Christian
Temperance Union and the Victorian
Chapter of the Independent Order of
Rechabites.
But Mr Phillips put his finger on
another notable point. He said that
of all the people who had lined up
to give evidence there was an “im-
portant absentee” the ordinary
citizen. If there was any organisation
that could claim to speak for the
ordinary citizen, here was its chance.
So far it has been frightfully diffi-
cult to find an ordinary citizen. Some
years back there was a group of
drinking citizens which had an organ-
isation called the League of Sane
Drinkers. Membership was 2s. a
head, and their object was to fight
those people who supported “insane
drinking conditions”. But no one
knows what happened to the league.
Drinkers don’t organise as well as
non-drinkers.
Mr Phillips’ appeal was so eloquent
it even caused the “Age” to start
quoting G. K. Chesterton with the
lines:
“Smile at us, pay us, pass us, but
do not quite forget
That we are the people of England,
and we have not spoken yet”.

OUT AND ABOUT
Making the Pennies Jingle
The campaign has ends , hut the melody lingers on
By JAN SMITH
Jingle writing is no job for amateurs.
Much as the housewife at her
washing machine might feel she
could improve on some of the good
advice and example daily directed at her,
she might as well forget about writing
another Letter to Debbie’s Mum.
Most Australian jingle writers work
in Sydney, the headquarters of big adver-
tising agencies like George Patterson,
J. Walter Thompson, Hansen Ruben-
sohn. Lintas, Briggs Canny and others.
Sydney jingle writer, band-leader Bob
Gibson thought there were three or
four in Melbourne, but the lack of big
recording studios in other capital cities
made it unlikely that other jingle writers
were at work there on a freelance basis,
unless in a small way for local radio.
Bob Gibson trained as a musician in
Perth and had his first band in Mel-
bourne in 1940. After some years on
the national Shell Show, he went to
England in 1948 and came back two
years later to play for the Ford Show.
By 1955, he was experimenting with
jingles, his first success being one for
Kelloggs. Today the office of Bob Gibson
Productions, in Darlinghurst Road, is
hung with awards from the Australian
Federation of Commercial Broadcasting
Stations for Kraft, Lever-Kitchen, Coca-
Cola and Nestles, and stacked with
enough jingle discs to fill a record
library.
Gibson’s biggest undertaking was the
Craven A bagpipe commercial. The tune
and lyrics were written by Leo Breen
of Patterson’s agency, who called in
Gibson to score, orchestrate and generally
take care of the sound side. Highland
pipers were taken to Katoomba, put in
a suitably misty glen, and wedded to
a pre-recorded soundtrack, resulting in
a piece of advertising history.
Not every agency has its Breen, but
Gibson and his partner Jim White are
no mere arrangers of other people’s
songs. Once the ideas are down, after
the last of many agency conferences,
Gibson finds the creative bit “relatively
simple”. “You know whether they want
a hard or soft sell, what angle they’re
pushing, and what age group they’re
appealing to and where. It doesn’t take
long to get the mood and the color from
this. Esso was very hard but Edgell’s
Peas was very easy.” Sometimes there’s
no lyric, just appropriate background
music as in Gemey and Milk Board
advertisements.
Jim White has worked as a musician,
written short stories, and has an Arts
degree. He has written the incidental
music for Ensemble Theatre productions
like “The Drunkard.” But his biggest
successes, agencywise, are simple ditties
like Arrowmint, Li’l Oat, Put a Tiger
In Your Tank and the immortal Louie
The Fly.
“I’m Louie the Fly,
I’m Louie the Fly,
Straight from rubbish tip to you.
Spreading disease with the greatest of
ease
Straight from rubbish tip to you.
I’m bad and mean and mighty unclean,
Afraid of no one, ’cept the man
With the can of Mortein.”
Which is the closest thing you can
find to a television classic.
White has a happy-go-lucky approach
to life in jingle-land and although he’s
aware of the agencies’ headaches over
translations and semantics (“Keep Coca
Cola in the house” once became “Keep
Coca Cola in the brothel”) he doesn’t
worry too much about the finer points
of motivation. If one word doesn’t suit,
he’ll change it happily without any
feeling of artistic betrayal.
Gibson’s organisation changed its
name last year to Bob Gibson Pro-
ductions Pty Ltd, formerly Bob Gibson
Orchestras. “It takes in the wider field,”
Gibson explained, “but it’s really the
same set-up of Jim and myself.” Gibson
spends one afternoon and one evening
a week rehearsing with Bobby Limb’s
“Sound of Music” group, but he
probably finds this more relaxing than
anything else.
Gibsons have also been responsible,
wholly or partly, for commercials about
Vegemite, Lux, Cussons, Camay, Tact,
Cadburys, Ceylon Tea, Airozone, Mr
Sheen, Edgells, Amoco, Esso, Shell,
Nestles and many others.
Gibson admitted Gilbert and Sullivan
was a slight help, but said they’d never
steal directly even now the copyright
had expired. “We used the general
G & S idea of rhythm and harmony
for the Hoovermatic Twins,” he said,
“but the only two songs I can remember
that were straight copies were Edgell’s
Bird’s Eye Peas (from the Civil War
Song “Eating Goober Peas”), and Mr
Sheen furniture wax.”
White recalled some tense moments
with a Shell ad last year. “I’d written
a line about Shell gives total power, when

the agency suddenly realised it might
infringe on their rival, Total. But the
advertisement was for Singapore, where
Total wasn’t marketed, so it turned out
all right.
Gibson is unmarried and finds no
distraction in working out tunes at home,
which more often than not is where the
ideas come. “I suppose it does give me
a sort of glow when I hear kids singing
Arrowmint jingles,” he admitted.
Even for the not-so-creative jingler,
who simply has access to a vocal group
and orchestra, there is work a-plenty.
Under the Federal Broadcasting Act, all
overseas jingles (mostly American) have
to be re-orchestrated and re-recorded,
and only 20 per cent of any commercial
may be imported material. In a 60-
second advertisement, this leaves a
meagre 12 seconds, which may be music,
film or voice sequence incapable of being
recorded or photographed locally.
Extensive travel shots are all right if
done by Australian photographers (such
as Peter Stuyvesant), and difficult tech-
nical processes, like Maxwell House’s
cup-and-a-half of coffee, are allowed a
few months’ grace until local producers
can learn the secrets involved.
One of Australia’s better-known trans-
formation jobs was done by independent
producer Will Pryor, who rearranged
Country Life (the tune is used in
America for another cigarette), with
Patterson’s Nigel Palethorpe and John
Crane creating lyrics to match Australian
locales riding schools, home auctions,
boating.
Nightclub singer
Sydney’s most prolific radio jingle
writer is singer Alan Dean, an East
Ham boy who began studying music
when he was 10. During the war he was
an entertainer in France and Belgium
and after a spell as an engineer’s
draughtsman he took up regular pro-
fessional work in London clubs. He
formed one of London’s first successful
vocal groups, the Keynotes of the BBC’s
“Take It From Here,” and in 1949
visited the United States, moving from
New York in 1956 to live at Miami.
Dean started his jingle career in
Miama. “I already had a good life as
a nightclub singer,” he said, “but the
children never saw me and I wanted
something that would let me settle down
for at least part of the year.” With a
friend called Marshall he operated as
Demar Productions, supjffying 90 per
cent of Florida’s businessmen with radio
and television jingles for products rang-
ing from local beer and cola to gilt-edged
real estate.
But it wasn’t enough for a full-time
career. “I know it sounds impressive,
the 90 per cent bit,” Dean says, “but
over there it’s equivalent to working in
Surfers Paradise. You get the local stuff
but miss out on all the national
products.”
Dean first visited Australia in 1961
for a season with GTV-9. Radio
executives were impressed with his work
and he came back again to live at
Warriewood and start a company for
the writing and producing of singing
commercials. Costs and profits are hard
to estimate. Some weeks he hires as
many as 30 people for recording and
arranging. Other weeks he devotes him-
self to his singing career.
A long experience with local groups
helped Dean tremendously. “Sometimes
the jingle isn’t much more than two or
three people singing yah yah yah in
the background,” he said, but it is not
with yah-ing and ooh-ing that a com-
mercial finds its way into the top five
of the world’s radio commercials, an
honor given to Dean’s kangaroo tail
soup jingle (for Masterfoods) by the
Hollywood Ad Club.
The words were predictable—“more
bounce to the ounce, more flavor to
savor” —but, in Rolf Harris style, Dean
added some impressive boompy noises
to the record to suggest kangaroos in full
flight. “The impact was so terrific the
shops were cleaned out,” Dean said, and
with the soup getting into the gourmet
class at 3/6 a tin, it certainly shows
what a little music can do. The supply
is now constant, and the jingle is stepped
up whenever demand starts to drop.
Dean’s other jingles (mainly for radio)
help sell Bic ballpoint pens, Bell’s Scotch
whisky, Orlando wines, Tarax, Vincent’s
APC, Auto Auctions, Kolotex stockings,
Sleepmaker mattresses and Peters ice-
cream, in addition to Volkswagen, Austin
Freeway, Morris Major and Datsun cars.
Dean works to the usual agency
procedure, turning out tunes and lyrics
to the executive’s prescription. But his
“That’s A Datsun” jingle was more of
a one-man effort. “I did the first Datsun
song for an agency, but just as the adver-
tisement was ready the agency lost the
account. It wasn’t until I saw the latest
model Datsun in a window that I
decided to rehash the old version and
submit it to the Datsun people. They
referred me to their new agency and
the jingle was used.”
While shaving
/Credit for the most memorable adult
commercial goes to Leo Breen. Breen
spent IS years managing Palings’ musical
instruments department, writing songs
like “Christmas Candles” and “Picking
Shamrocks in Killarney,” before he
wrote the Craven A king-sized filter
song. He is now music director of
Patterson’s, and his better known work
includes Berger Breeze, Ceylon tea,
Malley’s Whirlpool, A Little Bear Will
Fix It, and Viceroy cigarettes.
“I thought up the Craven A song
when I was shaving,” says Breen, who
does his best creative writing before ten
in the morning. A non-smoker, he con-
centrated on the words “Craven A king-
sized filter”, got the first line and then
wrote the rest of the song and put words
to it. The Craven A song now comes
in various arrangements including
Hawaiian, march and several kinds of
jazz versions.
Breen says this procedure is usual
with jingles. “Rodgers and Hammerstein
may do lyrics first and tune afterwards,
but with advertising it’s usually the
punch line that comes first. Once the
agency and client have picked the most
important quality mildness, smooth-
ness, cheapness, tastiness, or what have
you—it becomes the main line of the
music. Once the tune is finished, other
lesser information is fitted in as lyric.”
Breen’s career as a jingler has been
free from gaffe, although American ad
man and satirist Stan Freberg is alleged
to have doubled up over an early Breen
jingle for Peter’s ice-cream. “I didn’t

let it worry me,” Breen said, “but I
eventually learnt why it amused Freberg.
It’s all a question of idiom.”
Breen is modest about his achieve-
ments, and, like most connoisseurs of
social history( pays tribute to the Aero-
plane Jelly song, composed in 1930 by
organist-musician Les Woods with lyrics
by Aeroplane Jelly’s late founder and
managing director, A. H. Appleroth. The
song is still used as a theatre and tele-
vision commercial, and in 1959 so
intrigued Princess Alexandra, who heard
it from pressmen in hotels around Aus-
tralia, that she eventually asked for an
official rendition at a party in Brisbane.
Scottish, Irish and modern jazz
versions have been tried, but each time
letters pour in from indignant consumers
demanding the old version. Children sing
it regularly on Channel 7’s Saturday
afternoon show and Stan Freberg used it
as a theme song for his Stadium shows,
suggesting it was Australia’s closest thing
to a national song. A religious organisa-
tion has written new words and made
it into a hymn.
“Of course there are some things
you can’t write jingles about,” Breen
said wistfully, but when pressed for
examples could come up with only Rolls
Royces and the more exclusive brands
of cosmetics, both unlikely TV subjects.
A jingle, however, can be anything from
a marching song—such as the one Breen
wrote for a Navy recruiting drive to
an Eastern-style background tune for
Ceylon tea. For Seppelts Solero sherry,
Breen used a guitar solo to suggest
Spanish atmosphere, finishing with a
sung line “Seppelts Solero Sherry”.
With commercial television in its
eighth year, Breen suspects that many
viewers have trained themselves to ignore
or refute the spoken exhortation, making
the jingle the advertiser’* most strategic
weapon. It is not hard to make rude
remarks about unctuous voices and
faked-up situations (housewives getting
messages about chocolate drinks and
sneering at the neighbor’s washing;
machine) but it is very hard to poke
fun at a jingle.
In short, there is practically nothing
that can’t be put to music, and although
ad men may never know which 50 per
cent of their advertising is wasted effort,
the jingle itself lingers on.
Creating the Climate
The ABC’s new man in music
By MARGARET CLARKE
A young man in his thirties has
taken over the directorship of
music for the ABC. He exudes
youthful and vigorous ideas and his
career to date proves his capacity for
carrying out his ideas and for trans-
forming the situation in which he finds
himself. He is John Hopkins, already
known in Australia as a conductor,
having made four concert tours for the
ABC. During at least one of these the
accent was on youth, for he conducted
a series of concerts with the Australian
Youth Orchestra and worked with this
group at the 1963 National Music Camp.
To the question why did he relinquish
his post as musical director of the New
Zealand National Orchestra to come to
Australia, Mr Hopkins smiled a smile
that was both elated and cautious. “For
14 years,” he said, “I have been working
as resident conductor with three different
orchestras. It is interesting to have a
break from day-to-day conducting.” The
three orchestras were the BBC Scottish,
the BBC Northern and the New Zealand
National.
“After eight years with the BBC—
I was 22 when appointed to the BBC
Scottish I was glad to go to New
Zealand to do public concerts instead
of radio work all the time. Now,
knowing the scope on the Australian
scene, I was tempted by the opportunity
to come here.” He added: “I was happy
in New Zealand and, after six years, I
was sorry to leave.”
He described the New Zealand
musical situation as he found it upon
arrival from England, briefly outlined
the developments that took place during
his regime and the situation he left
behind him: a vastly improved orchestra
and an opera company that had
developed from a small group of singers.
In appearance he is a man of middle
height and fresh English complexion,
fair hair beginning to recede, with a fine
pair of candid blue-grey Celtic eyes
his most compelling feature. He has
the easy and relaxed manner of a
successful and confident man and as he
talked to me he sat shirt-sleeved in an
armchair (in his office) eating brown-
bread green cheese sandwiches, brought
from home, and apples. To every
question he was sympathetic and re-

sponsive and instantly “with it,” though
discreet and restrained in his replies.
Mr Hopkins said that he had taken
up his post in Australia only last October
and it was too soon to make judgments:
in New Zealand it had taken him .18
months to obtain a clear picture of
conditions.
If music is to thrive in any community,
he said, a favorable climate must be
created, if it does not already exist. This
applies equally to the development of
the performer and the composer.
Pointing out that Beethoven and Mozart
did not suddenly appear out of the blue,
he said Australia could not hope to
produce great composers unless en-
couragement were given to existing
composers by performing their works:
no composer could be expected to keep
on creating unless he found some outlet
through performances and some re-
sponse from audiences. He said he had
not yet heard enough Australian music
to assess it, but he did mention the
New Zealander Douglas Lilburne as a
composer of some stature whose music
he had performed.
Hopkins said that Australian per-
formers must be encouraged and
applauded if Australia is ever to achieve
an indigenous musical culture. He said
he would like to see Australian artists
making overseas tours from their home
base and winning recognition as visitors
from Australia. He mentioned the
numbers of Australian musicians who
had established themselves in London
and made reputations both in England
and Europe as proof that Australia was
able to produce fine performers.
This brought Mr Hopkins to the
training of musicians, in particular of
orchestral instrumentalists. In New
Zealand he had introduced a scheme
which he believed was unique, that of

attaching trainee players to the orchestra
to give them experience in orchestral
playing. This not only provided a stream

selves ensured a professional career.
“I want to make the musician’s pro-
fession attractive to young people,” he
said. “A number of those I met at the
National Music Camp told me they did
not intend to take up music as a career,
not deeming it a ‘safe’ profession.”
He then referred to Sydney’s re-
furbished Hurlstone Choir. He said the
auditions recently held had been most
successful and that the choir now con-
sisted of young and more vigorous
people. It also had a large provisional
membership which meant that it would
be possible to perform more choral
works more successfully,
Conspicuous on Mr Hopkins’ list of
choral works to be performed is
Benjamin Britten’s War Requiem, written
for the dedication of Coventry Cathedral,
which is to be given its Australian
premiere at the Adelaide. Festival in
March. He said it would probably be
repeated in Sydney late this year.

Dependence on Vitamins
“All that Miss T eats turns into Miss T"
Vitamins are not only food sub-
stances needed in small amounts
by man and other animals. Each
of them is also a specific example of
the dependence of one form of life on
others; they are substances which the
cells of man or animals are unable to
make from the general pool of raw
materials that eating of food makes
available.
The general dependence of animals
on plants is a fact known for a long
time. “All that Miss T eats turns into
Miss T”; but without the unique ability
of plants to use the energy of sunlight
to build up complex substances, there
would be no general pool of organic
raw materials, partly broken down from
those formed in the first instance by
plants, on which Miss T could get to
work and re-form to her own specifica-
tions. Again, there are numerous
examples, many of them long recognised,
of the biological dependence of one
species on another, or of mutual de-
pendence between species. What, then,
is “special” about the kind of depen-
dence illustrated by vitamins?
The answer lies in the scale in which
its effects are shown. No longer are we
dealing with the overall economy of
living things, or even with interaction
between organisms as a whole. We are
concerned with chemical reactions
carried out in our own cells, or those
of animals, which could not be carried
out without the help of a ready-made
primer derived from micro-organisms or
higher plants. The primary agents pro-
moting these chemical reactions —one
for each reaction are the special
proteins, enzymes, which we build up
for ourselves under genetic control. For
this purpose what has been called the
general pool of raw materials is
sufficient. But many of these enzymes
require for their effective action that a
further substance a co-factor or
co-enzyme should be present; and for
some of them, a vitamin, sometimes in
its original form but more often
chemically modified in the body, is the
necessary co-factor. By no means the
whole story has been elucidated, but
enough has been done to suggest that
this is the correct explanation of why
each of some 13 vitamins is necessary,
and an increasing proportion of research
has moved on to the next problem—■
the means by which organisms that do
produce vitamins produce them.
The most extreme example of this
kind of dependence is provided by
vitamin 81, otherwise thiamine, lack of
which causes the deficiency disease beri-
beri, formerly widespread in tropical
countries. It is a co-factor for at least
four different enzymes, one or more of
which have been isolated from each
of fungi, bacteria, plants and animal
tissues, while the production of thiamine
itself is highly selective.
According to a recent summary by
Professor T. W. Goodwin, of Aberyst-
wyth—in his book “The Biosynthesis
of Vitamins and Related Compounds”—
the root tissues of most of the higher
plants do not produce thiamine, but in
reproductive tissues thiamine is well
distributed. In wheat it appears to be
produced primarily in vegetative tissues
up to the time when seeds begin to
develop, and then to be transferred to
the seeds. A minority of small water-
living algae, on the other hand, are
unable to make thiamine for themselves
but probably get it, through the water
around them, from other species that
make it.
Bacteria and fungi show all varieties
of performance. Most bacteria make
thiamine, but there are a few which
either require it ready-made or to be
supplied with one or both of the two
components from which thiamine is
formed. A similar division is found in
fungi and it was from a fungus that
the first clue was obtained about the
chemical reactions by which the two
components of thiamine are put together.
Working backwards from this, it has
lately been suggested that one of these
components may itself be formed by a
chain of reactions analogous to those
responsible for the building up of part
of the penicillin molecule in moulds that
produce it. Yet thiamine is no esoteric
special product, but a substance needed
by all forms of life, whether or not
they make it themselves.
Thiamine is also a case in which both
the modified form in which it acts in
the body, in conjunction with enzymes,
has been discovered; and also in yeast,
at least it is known how this chemically
combined thiamine is produced. This is
likely to be a universal reaction since it
is only in the combined form that results
that thiamine is known to fulfil specific
functions in cells.
There are many problems about
vitamins. In the case of the familiar
vitamins A and D—the latter, the one
that prevents rickets for example,
matters are complicated by the fact that
both have precursors, which can be
converted by animals into the vitamins;
and there is still uncertainty about why
it is that the liver oils of fish such as
halibut and tuna should be rich sources
of vitamin D. But the point of this
article will have been made if it is
appreciated that, through research on
vitamins, the dependence of one form
of life on others has been made evident
at a level not before amenable to study.

OVERSEAS
De Gaulle’s Damp Squib?
The deal with Red China
From WILLIAM MILLINSHIP in Paris
By recognising the Peking Govern-
ment, General de Gaulle has sat
in on a three-handed game of
poker with the “two Chinas” which has
his professional diplomats worried. So
far the game has gone his way. He
eluded Chinese pre-conditions. Peking
did not insist that France break with
Nationalist China before the official
announcement that France and Com-
munist China would exchange ambas-
sadors within three months. And the
announcement made no mention of
Formosa.
This was a tactical success, but there
is a good deal of uncertainty about the
next moves. There is no sign that Peking
will abandon its claim to Formosa and,
I understand, the French have no
assurance that the Communists will, in
fact, despatch an ambassador to Paris
while Chiang Kai-shek has an embassy
there.
Britain recognised the Communist
regime 14 years ago but they never
exchanged ambassadors, because the
British kept a consul-general in Formosa.
If France is allowed to have only a
charge d’affaires in Peking, the latest
Gaullist bomb will look uncomfortably
like a damp squib.
It is widely believed here that General
de Gaulle expected Chiang Kai-shek to
solve this problem by breaking off diplo-
matic relations with France. He did make
a strong protest, but, no doubt in res-
ponse to American pressure, took no fur-
ther action. What will happen if he
continues to sit tight?
French officials, so far, can give no
answer. Other sources suggest, however,
that France might try to provoke Chiang
Kai-shek by, for example, regretfully
asking him to hand over his Paris
embassy building to the Chinese Com-
munists. As a last resort, France could
break with Formosa herself, though this
would amount to an admission of failure
in an attempt to bring an original answer
to the “two Chinas” problem.
Some people argue that de Gaulle
would never treat such an old ally as
Chiang Kai-shek in this way. Much has
been made of the fact that the French
sent a special envoy to Taipeh in the
person of General Pechkoff, the former
French Ambassador to China, who has
known Chiang for years.
But it would be a mistake to suppose
that de Gaulle would ever allow senti-
mental feelings to dictate a course of
action. He deals in “realities” and to him
China is a “reality” that must be
recognised.
Few Frenchmen would disagree with
him on this score. What criticism there
is in France is chiefly about the manner
and timing of the General’s Chinese
operation which give it the air of an
affront to the United States.
In Gaullist eyes, of course, part of the
operation’s value is that it does displease
the United States. M. Michel Debre,
former French Premier, described it as
“the affirmation of a reasonable indepen-
dence”.
Since the Sino-Soviet quarrel, Com-
munist China also satisfies the Gaullist
definition of an independent nation. The
General himself forecast this develop-
ment at his Press conference in
November, 1959, but saw it then as a
reason for expecting the Soviet Union
to draw closer to Western Europe.
The “yellow multitude”, however, did
not increase Soviet interest in the Gaullist
theory of a Europe “from the Atlantic
to the Urals”. Moscow, instead, pre-
ferred to open a dialogue with Washing-
ton, thus reviving de Gaulle’s obsessive
fear of a Russo-American “double
hegemony”—a sort of repetition of the
Yalta Conference, which is never far
from the General’s mind.
De Gaulle refused to sign the nuclear
test ban treaty. So did Communist China.
And this Franco-Chinese declaration of
independence from the two super Powers
had a considerable influence on the
French decision to recognise Communist
China.
Though Paris and Peking are ideologi-
cally poles apart, the General has clearly
decided they have enough in common
to make a Franco-Chinese dialogue
worthwhile. With this in view, he may
be expected to show less concern than
his professional diplomats with the
intricacies of the Formosa problem.

Peking’s Line
Look at Senegal
From STANLEY KARNOW in
Hong Kong
report that in negotiating the
A modalities of French recognition,
the Chinese Communists did not insist
that Paris break relations with the
Chinese Nationalist Government on
Formosa has led many commentators
in the West to conclude that Peking has
taken a new line and will henceforth
maintain diplomatic relations with
governments that simultaneously re-
cognise Nationalist China.
Most observers here, however, con-
sider this interpretation illusory. Opposi-
tion to the theory of “two Chinas” is
one of the foundations of Peking’s policy.
Typical of Chinese thinking is the state-
ment by the Communist women’s leader,
Ho Hsiang-Ning. “The people in
Formosa are members of the great
family of the Motherland,” she said. “No
countries or forces on earth can separate
them from the great family of China,
nor shatter the determination of the
Chinese people to liberate Formosa,
which is their own territory.”
For Peking to relinquish this claim
would constitute a total switch in foreign
policy. Among other things, it would
knock the bottom out of Communist
propaganda which, for example, con-
siders the American military presence
in Formosa tantamount to US occupation
of part of China. It is unlikely Peking
would alter its principles for the sake
of France.
The way Peking behaves in the face
of the dual recognition problem was
demonstrated two years ago in the
African State of Senegal, where the
Chinese Nationalists maintained a repre-
sentative. In 1961, Senegal decided to
recognise Peking but declined to expel
the Nationalist diplomat. The Com-
munists refused to acknowledge the re-
cognition by opening a legation in the
Senegalese capital. Thus in Senegal
today the country unilaterally recognises
the Chinese Communists but the only
Chinese diplomat in the Senegal capital
is Nationalist.

Turkey’s Cuba
Will Cyprus go Communist?
From an Ankara Correspondent
Ohould a peaceful solution for Cyprus
not be reached, actual military action
would be very much a last resort for
Turkey. The Turks do not want to play
their last card if they do not have to.
But it would be wrong to assume they
are bluffing over Cyprus. •
They are capable of invading the
island, though it would tear a breach in
the NATO alliance, risk war between
Turkey and Greece, and antagonise world
opinion. Physically the operation would
not be too difficult. Cyprus is 40 miles
from the south coast of Turkey which is
the largest military Power in the Middle
East, and for that matter, in terms of
men under arms, in the NATO alliance.
The Turkish Prime Minister, Mr Ismet
Inonii, now 80, is a man of great skill
and patience. So long as he is in
command he would not commit his
country to a desperate adventure which
might split the Western alliance. Inonii
was the man who stood firmly for his
country’s interests at the conference of
Lausanne in 1922; but he is also the
cautious statesman who kept Turkey
neutral during the Second World War.
What has brought Turkey to the point
where a Turkish landing on Cyprus has
even been contemplated is that the Turks
feel that their case has not been under-
stood, and that most countries, even
some of their own NATO allies, tend to
side with the Greeks. The Turkish view
is that the Turkish Cypriots, although
outnumbered four to one by the Greek
Cypriots, are not a minority in the
ordinary sense, but a separate community
of a different religion, race, and
language. They claim that normal
guarantees given in other mixed States
to minorities will not do in the Cyprus
case.
They claim that the Christmas fighting
in Cyprus proves that these communities
cannot live together, and that there is
no possibility of Turks and Greeks on
Cyprus merging to form a single Cypriot
nationality. Therefore the only sensible
answer is some kind of regroupment of
the two communities which will allow
them to live separately.
What lies behind this Ankara policy?
There is no question that the Turks of
Turkey have an intense preoccupation
with Cyprus. The island is much nearer
to their shores than Cuba is to the
United States. Cyprus belonged to
Turkey for over 300 years. Despite the
Greek majority, most Turks still think
of it as Turkish, and in recent demon-
strations in Turkey the slogan has been
“Cyprus is ours. Annex it!”
But there is a deeper motive. Turkey
has always been acutely conscious of
the Soviet threat to the Middle East.
She has not much confidence in the
countries which surround her and, in
particular, has never been convinced
that the Greeks can resist Communism.
For this reason Turkey will never permit
Cyprus to be annexed to Greece (Enosis),.
because if Greece ever went Communist,
Russia would have by-passed Turkey and
got a foot in the Mediterranean.
But now there is a more imminent
danger: that Cyprus itself might go
Communist. The proportion of the
Cypriot electorate which votes Com-
munist is said to be larger than in Italy,
which has the largest Communist Party
in Europe. Cyprus has already been
called “Turkey’s Cuba”.
Behind Ankara’s preoccupation with
the rights and freedoms of the Cypriot
Turks—in itself perfectly genuine—there
lies the strategic motive; that only some
kind of physical partition of Cyprus,
even in the form of a “federal State,”
would give Turkey a legal and practical
hold over a part of the island which
would help her resist, or at least to
some extent neutralise, a Communist
take-over, (ofns)
“Slave Revolt”
Zanzibar’s dotty Field Marshal
From ANTHONY SAMPSON
in Zanzibar
There are signs of growing friction
between the bizarre triumvirate
who rule Zanzibar after the so-
called “slave revolt”. In the past few
days the discrepancies have come further
out into the open, and even on to the
radio.
Officially, the boss is the President,
the big, slow and lethargic African Adeid
Karume, who now occupies the stately
old British Resident’s Palace overlooking
the Indian Ocean.
He is not an electric leader, and only
10 days before the revolution he was
under heavy fire from his “progressive”
rival Othman Sharif, who accused him
of being reactionary and stupid. Presi-
dent Karume has hardly made any policy
statements since the revolution apart
from exhorting people to observe Rama-
dan, a safe policy in an island which is
98 per cent Muslim.
But he still commands heavy support
from the African population, and he is
an authentic African leader who has
been through the mill of nationalism.


I

NZL27/6 3
His policy is African, suspicious but not
apparently aggressive. He insisted, in
a conversation recently, that if Britain
did not recognise Zanzibar the High
Commissioner might have to leave; and
he accuses Britain of trying to foment
the differences between the Zanzibar
leaders and suspects her of plotting to
get the Sultan back. But Karume is
almost equally suspicious of his col-
leagues perhaps with some reason.
A great deal of the policy-making is
clearly coming now from Babu, the tire-
less Left-wing Foreign Minister. He is
a man of charming ugliness, with a huge
and articulate mouth; clearly a born re-
volutionary, even if he did not organise
this revolution. He has a small band of
“comrades” round him, a few of whom
have been to Cuba or China, although
the Cuban influence has been absurdly
exaggerated. Babu makes no bones
about his Chinese interests he has tw'o
tall pictures of China in his draw'ing-
room but most of the evidence of
heavy Cuban-Chinese influence seems
unfounded: the Chinese Charge
d’Affaires, for instance, who arrived just
after the revolution, was actually invited
by the previous regime; and the “Cuban”
berets were stolen from the mobile police
in Zanzibar.
Babu maintained in a recent interview
that he wants Zanzibar to stay in the
Commonwealth, that he is glad of the
British intervention in East Africa, and
that he will attend the conference of
African Foreign Ministers in Dar-es-
Salaam.
Babu is far more dynamic and intelli-
gent than Karume; and he may well have
ambitions to turn Zanzibar, with a
second revolution, into a Marxist State.
But until that happens his position is
delicate; for he is cosmopolitan and half
Arab; and the roots of this revolution
were certainly African Nationalist, anti-
Arab and suspicious of all outside dog-
mas.
Babu and Karume have just merged
their tw'o political parties (Mr Babu’s
Umma Party and the Afro-Shirazi
Party). But they come from quite dif-
ferent worlds, and this partnership will
remain an uneasy one. The real prob-
lem is the third man, the phenomenal
27-year-old Field-Marshal John Okello.
While I was talking to the President
there was a clatter in the corridor and in
strode the Field-Marshal still wearing a
belt full of cartridges and fondling his
huge pistol. He glared round him, sat
down, banged the pistol on to the table
in front of him and threw two large
photographs of himself over to the Presi-
dent. The President looked quite unde-
terred, but immediately insisted on being
left alone with the Field-Marshal.
Okello has openly proclaimed his
grievances over the radio: he treats the
microphone as an angry sergeant-major
might use a megaphone—quite un-
aware of the political consequences.
Among his earliest pronouncements in
Swahili three weeks ago were:
“I have an army equal to a swarm of
locusts”.
“The power behind me is
999,999,000”.
“If anyone waits until I start to use
force, I will deal with them to the ex-
tent of eliminating them and that will
be child’s play to me”.
Recently he complained on Zanzibar
radio that he was not being properly
appreciated, and even threatened to leave
the island. Next day the quarrel had to
be patched up by all three leaders speak-
ing on the same night.
Field-Marshal is showing con-
tinuing symptoms of being, to put it
boldly, a bit dotty: at one point last week
it even looked as if he was going to
shoot himself. The other two leaders
would clearly like to be rid of him, but
it was he, after all, who chose them; and
he still has several hundred guns.
However this rivalry resolves itself,
Zanzibar is beginning to settle down to
some kind of law and order—though
no one is sure whose law and whose
order. One interesting development is that
the Zanzibar Government has invited
Professor Tom Frank, an unconven-
tional and enthusiastic young Canadian
professor of law, who has previously ad-
vised the Afro-Shirazis, to come to Zan-
zibar to advise on the new constitution.
The enchanting island, which looks
like a tropical, dried-up Venice, is slowly
and uneasily returning to normal. Many
shops are still shut, with bits of white
cloth hanging from the shutters to indi-
cate “We surrender”. The new national
flag, black, green and blue, is flying from
Government buildings. Old postage
stamps are being issued, with Jamhari
(revolution) stamped over the Sultan's
face. Asians are tactfully wearing yel-
low or green tabs on their shirts (the
colours of the Afro-Shirazi Party). The
English Club is crowded and seems un-
fussed and even bored: none of the few
hundred English residents was touched
during the revolution, (ofns.)

Brambles Plays Two Parts in Sending
Trade Ship Expedition to “Near North”
The Brambles Group has been appointed Honorary Customs Agent and Carrier to the Trade Ship
“Centaur” which will sail from Australia to Asia in March. Brambles will have an executive aboard to act
as customs consultant to the expedition. He will also act as Group representative in contacting agents and
seeking new business in Asia. “Centaur” has been chartered by the Export Council of the Australian Chambers
of Commerce. She will take exhibits of Australian products to Singapore, Bangkok, Manila, Hong Kong,
Osaka and Tokyo. At Osaka the ship will be a floating pavilion of the Osaka Trade Fair.
A trade mission of more than 100
representatives of Australian industry
and commerce will travel with the ship.
The Brambles representative will be

of Sydney for
many years. Mr.
Ferguson has been
appointed to the
administrative staff
of the Trade Dele-
gation.
As honor ary
carrier, Brambles
will receive and
store all exhibits
as they are assembled at Australian ports.
Brambles Transport will cart them to
the wharf for loading aboard “Centaur”.
The appointment of Brambles to assist
the Trade Expedition reflects the sub-
stantial part which the Group plays as
a service organisation to Australian busi-
ness. It is expected that the on-the-spot
consulting service aboard “Centaur” will
be of particular value in assisting dele-
gates and sales prospects in Asia to
close deals.
More than 400 Australian companies
have booked space on “Centaur” and
30,000 sq. ft. of deck will be covered
with exhibits. This is Australia’s third
Trade Ship Expedition to leave home
waters in six years. The first went on
“Delos” in 1958 and the second on
“Straat Banka” in 1961.
Apart from the opportunity to gain
new business in the markets of the “Near
North”, the Brambles Group approaches

Farm, Factory Successes
For Manufacturing Unit
VU- G. Pickrell Pty. Ltd.— manufacturing unit of the
Brambles Group—has reported two success stories. One
concerns new farm machinery and the other the supply of
process reaction vessels for a pharmaceutical company.
Pickrells have installed the first “Coldvert” instant chilling
milk vat on a farm near Muswellbrook. The farmer, Mr.
Colin L. Ellis, reported his appreciation to Pickrells after a
heat-wave:
“The recent extremely hot weather conditions, when the
temperature in the milk room was between 95° and 100°,
would really test any unit, but the milk in the ‘Coldvert’
did not at any time rise above 42°, an achievement to be con-
gratulated on.”

At Tarro, a causeway is being constructed 80 feet high and

solid fill a day, and Brambles have more than kept pace with
this requirement.

Joint Venture Company’s
Progress on S.A. Road
Hornibrook Brambles Constructions, our civil
engineering joint venture in South Australia, continues
to make solid progress on what is probably the most rugged
road construction project ever undertaken in the Common-
wealth. The contract is for the deviation of the Torrens
Gorge Main Road to make way for a high dam across the
Gorge.
The road is being blasted into the steep rocky hillside of
the Torrens River and will involve the removal of nearly one
million cubic yards of hard rock, all of which is being loaded
to disposal by large face shovels from the fleet of our excava-
tion subsidiary, A. Bradshaw (Excavations) Pty. Limited. Total
length of road to be relocated is 4 miles. The work will be
completed by mid-1965.
Work has also started on another major South Australian
Project for the Adelaide Trunk Sewer, a £2 million contract
involving the construction of more than 7 miles of sewer
from 7 feet up to 10 feet in diameter. This work is being
undertaken by the same Joint Venture.

Ready for the haul to Hay: oil drill components loaded aboard a train specially organised by Brambles.
AWKWARD LOAD DEMANDED COMBINED OPERATION
Brambles Transport opened 1964 with
a twin package deal on an oil rig.
One package Brambles sent by rail
and the other by road.
The two packages together weighed
310 tons.
The rig, owned by the Australian
Drilling Company, had to be assembled
in Sydney and moved to a point twenty
miles out of Hay on the way to Jerilderie.
It comprised tanks, pumps, motors, drills,
derricks, pipes and steel buildings.
Some units were extremely long, some
were extremely wide. All were heavy
and many were of bulky and awkward
shapes. That is why Brambles Trans-
port executives decided to make the
job a combined rail-road operation.
Investigation of the transport engin-
eering problems involved showed that
a mixed bag of rail bogie flat and sided
trucks, and road low loaders and jinkers
would be needed to accommodate the
variety of loads.
Rig components began their journey
from the Mobil storage at Camellia,
near Sydney. The first leg of the journey
was the shortest —a furlong from storage
to rail siding. Brambles road vehicles
aided by two CHEP cranes lifted and
carried the 260 tons of machinery destin-
ed to go by rail to the train specially
assembled for the job. It consisted of
four bogie sided and 11 bogie flat trucks.
Meanwhile, Back
At the Store . .
Rail way Department supervisors
came in at this stage with expert know-
ledge of how to stow awkward loads
safely aboard rail trucks. They stayed
throughout the three days of loading and
saw each piece of gear safely chained
down, before a locomotive coupled up
and the train pulled out.
The road package was made up on
three big Brambles vehicles for the haul
direct to the drilling point. The road
consignment totalled 50 tons and travel-
led under escort with a special permit
for a wide load.
At Hay, the Railways part in the
operation ended and Brambles road
units ferried the rig components over
the last leg of the journey—the twenty
miles toward Jerilderie.
Operation Oil Rig was completed in
a total of 8 working days during which
310 tons of heavy, ungainly “hard-to-
handle” equipment were carried 500
miles to an isolated paddock in a sparsely
populated area. Success came from
expert knowledge of transport engineer-
ing and the combined use of road and
rail facilities.


Around Brisbane
AAH FOR THE OLD TERRACE!
One of Brisbane’s oldest, most
dignified and historic streets,
Wickham Terrace, long the
tapping, testing and aah-ing ground
of Brisbane’s specialist medical men,
is getting a thorough examination by
real-estate investors these days. This
check-up and overhaul is giving the
patient a new and modern look in
keeping with the kind of develop-
ment which Lord Mayor Clem Jones
likes to see in the city. But it is
destroying the placid, old-world
character which “the Terrace” once
had.
Shaped like a long-handled sickle,
and curving across Windmill Hill
roughly from west to east, Wickham
Terrace follows a high ridge which
overlooks the inner city from near
its northern boundary. In its early
days, it was the residential dress
circle of the Moreton Bay colony,
growing into a quiet and tree-shaded
thoroughfare which obviously followed
the tracks of the horse-drawn vehicles.
The medical fraternity adopted it
as an address and it bore a cachet
which persists today. Its colony of
frock-coated doctors drove their traps
to and from their big, high-ceilinged,
rambling mansions and life was as
slowly measured as the time ball
which dropped each day at one
o’clock from the staff at the summit
of the old windmill tower.
Apart from the present specialist
medical consultants and their corol-
laries, the radiologists, pathologists,
pharmacists and speech therapists,
and two private hospitals run by the
Catholic and Presbyterian Churches,
the terrace has over the years
acquired five churches, two service-
men’s clubs, an amateur theatre and
a few coffee shops and restaurants.
Some of the old colonial houses,
with their broad, low verandahs, are
still there, but others have been razed
to make way for new, multi-storey
medical centres, motels and banks.
The City Council’s five-tiered parking
station will face a 13-storey medical
block.
At the eastern end, a gracious old
home has been pulled down and the
Lutheran Church has built modern
doctors’ premises next to their quaint,
white St Andrew’s- Church. A few
yards west is a glass-fronted coffee
lounge and a block of serviced rooms
in glass and yellow brick.
The doctors no longer live on the
terrace but in the fashionable outer
suburbs. More and more accommoda-
tion is being created for their con-
sulting rooms, although public trans-
port does not cater satisfactorily for
the ill and disabled who make pil-
grimages to the street of specialists.
It is a steep pull from the city on
foot, even for someone in reasonable
health who has left his car either
in the City Council parking station
(6s. per day) or in one of the vacant
lot car parks (2s. per day).
But something of the quiet dignity
of old Wickham Terrace persists,
despite parking meters and modern
architecture. There are shady trees
and old houses, worn stonework, and
the round tower of the old windmill,
shaped something like a castle chess
piece. Innocuous and picturesque
though it appears now, the old mill
(usually termed the Observatory) has
its origin in the days when Moreton
Bay was a penal colony, carrying an
overflow of convicts from Botany
Bay and Van Diemen’s Land. The
windmill was built by convict labor
in 1829 but the sails did not work
and a treadmill for operation by
convicts was erected outside the
tower, with a connecting shaft and
cogwheels which turned the mill
stones inside to grind the maize. In
1837, when Andrew Petrie became
foreman of works, repairs were
effected and the treadmill abolished.
In 1841, two aboriginal murderers
were hanged from the projecting
arms of the tower and, in 1855,
Brisbane’s first museum was housed
either in the mill tower or in the
signal station attached. In 1864 it
was used as a Government signal
station and as a lookout for the
fire brigade. A red ensign was
run up the flagstaff to announce the
arrival of English mail steamers.
After Federation the mill was desig-
nated an observatory but it was never
used as one.
At this period the time ball,
dropped each day at one o’clock,
enabled the gentry to set their time-
pieces. The first actual television
transmissions in Australia were
broadcast from the tower of the old
mill in 1935, when an experimental
TV service was operated by Dr Val
McDonald and Thomas M. B. Elliott.
Right opposite the Observatory, a
£500,000 circular motel, featuring a
revolving restaurant on the roof, will
be built by a Brisbane company. It
will be seven to 10 storeys high,
air-conditioned, with 70 to 90 units.
It will be called Observatory Motel
and the restaurant will make a
complete revolution every 30 minutes.
So far there is no talk of a time
ball or a treadmill. The Lord Mayor
is quoted as saying: “This will be
the ideal type of development we
want in the area.”
At the eastern end of the terrace
is the oldest of the street’s five
churches: All Saints’ Church of
England. The present building,
erected in 1869, of huge porphyry
stone blocks from the Petrie quarries,
has walls 20 inches thick and re-
sembles an English village church.
It cost £1864 9s. lOd. and its founda-
tion stone was laid by the Governor
of Queensland, Sir Samuel Wensley
Blackall. Its one acre of land is
graced by fine old trees and bounded
by a thick rustic wall of rough-
hewn stone.
Wickham Terrace is a chequered
pattern of old and new, but slowly,
irrevocably, the old terrace is going.
Meanwhile, you can find some
delightfully quiet spots there around
midday when the group of old men
gather at the big concrete draughts-
board in the shady park beside the old
windmill and push the large rubber
draughtsmen into strategic positions,
oblivious to the faint roar of the
city down below.
Let us hope that the revolving
diners in the future Observatory
Motel restaurant won’t disturb what
peace there is. I wonder if those
millstones still work.

FORUM
Lawyers for New Guinea
Remember Africa
By JOHN KERR
{Vice-President of the Law Council of Australia)
A strong, independent and indige-
nous legal profession is a necessity
if there is to be any prospect of
establishing the rule of law in a self-
governing New Guinea. Taken by itself,
it is not a guarantee that the rule of
law will prevail but it is one necessary
condition.
For this reason the Law Council of
Australia has been assisting in bringing
such an indigenous legal profession to
birth. Fundamentally, its reason for this
is based upon the fact that within the
next, say, twelve years Papua-New
Guinea will become independent or self-
governing and it would be absurd and
dangerous if there were then no indige-
nous lawyers to provide at least some of
the legal personnel needed in politics,
government, administration of justice and
private legal practice.
Unless something significant and
urgent is done about this problem, New
Guinea will be probably the first colonial
territory to reach independence without
an indigenous lawyer in its first Cabinet
or available at the top levels of admini-
stration to advise the Cabinet. At the
moment there are no native lawyers in
New Guinea. There is only one law
student, an undergraduate at the Law
School at the University of Queensland.
In a recent address the former
Minister for Territories, Mr Paul Has-
luck, said: “I am quite certain in my
own mind that the form of self-govern-
ment will come to Papua and New
Guinea before the country is economi-
cally viable and before it is fully
equipped either to finance or to staff
the various departments and agencies
of government.”
It seems likely, therefore, that self-
government will come in New Guinea
before there are enough lawyers to
provide the judges for the Bench, a
profession to help administer justice, and
lawyers for Parliament and for govern-
ment and administrative work.
It is nonetheless of great importance
that as many lawyers as possible be
educated during the next fifteen years.
The five students from Sogeri, who have
been invited here by the Law Council,
are members of the 1964 Matriculation
class at that school; they will return
to Sogeri to study for the Leaving
Certificate examination and if successful
their intention is to read law at a
university in Australia. Each year there-
after it is hoped that some of the better
students will elect to study law.
So it seems possible that about six
years from now there will be two or
three young indigenous lawyers in New
Guinea and about ten years thereafter
quite a few. By the time of indepen-
dence, although there will not be enough
lawyers, particularly mature and ex-
perienced lawyers, there should be
enough to make a local contribution to
the legislative, executive and judicial
processes.
The task of bringing such a legal
profession into existence is not an easy
one and not a matter for governmental
planning alone. To such an emerging
profession there must be contributed,
in addition to ordinary legal training, the
appropriate values of courage and in-
dependence and the proper ethical
standards. This can best be done by
and through an established legal pro-
fession and the legal profession in Aus-
tralia and New Guinea will help in the
task. The President of the Law Council
of Australia, Mr J. B. Piggott, CBE,
recently visited New Guinea and, in
preparation for his visit, the European
lawyers in the Territory formed a Papua-
New Guinea Law Society. This new
association includes both the lawyers in
private practice and those in the public
service. It should provide a professional
association which can become the pro-
fessional matrix of the indigenous
lawyers as they qualify. The Law Council
of Australia has set up a committee to
consider ways and means of bringing
the Papua-New Guinea Law Society into
some form of association with the Law
Council of Australia.
The latter body does not, however,
believe that membership of the local
Law Society and, when it is organised
in New Guinea, legal training there are
sufficient alone to produce a strong
indigenous profession. In the early years,
until the indigenous profession develops
its own standards, the Law Council takes
the view that anyone trained in law
in New Guinea should have some
experience with the legal profession in
Australia, preferably after he has had
his local legal education.
The Council is willing to prepare a
scheme under which, with government
assistance, graduates of a New Guinea
law school (when one is established)
could be brought to Australia and placed
in offices and chambers for a short
period of training. In this way the Aus-
tralian profession would be able to play
a role to some extent analogous to that
played by the United Kingdom pro-
fession in relation to Asian and African
lawyers.
No law school
f egal education is not yet being pro-
vided in New Guinea. There is no
local New Guinea law school and,
indeed, no local New Guinea university.
The Commission on Higher Education
for Papua and New Guinea is about
to bring down a report on the setting
up of a New Guinea University. To that
Commission the Law Council presented
detailed submissions on the matter of
legal education for the New Guinea
people. It urged that a law school
should be established within the Territory
at the earliest moment as part of a Uni-
versity covering comprehensively the rea-
sonable needs of the inhabitants in pro-
fessional and academic disciplines. It
made detailed suggestions about the
immediate organisation of research in
New Guinea law and about ways and
means of ensuring the starting of a New
Guinea law school by academics of
high standing. It directed its evidence
also to the task of seeing that such a law
school is kept within the family of Aus-
tralian law schools.
It was recognised by the Law Council
that, even if its submissions were fully
accepted by the Commission and by
the Government, local aspirants to the
legal profession could not receive their
legal education in New Guinea for
several years. It urged that in the mean-
time as many matriculants as it is
humanly possible to obtain should be
trained in Australian law schools each
year until the local law school begins
to function. It also pressed upon the
Commission the view that it should be
recognised as a matter of national


concern transcending departmental com-
petition that indigenous matriculants
adequate in numbers and standard to
fulfil its recommendations should be
obtained. The necessary scholarships and
grants to equalise competing financial
inducements should be forthcoming.
It should not be imagined that the
legal profession will tolerate standards
of teaching and examination in the New
Guinea law school lower than those
prevailing here but it will be possible
in such a law school to accommodate
the course, in content, to the New
Guinea situation, to give help by way
of remedial courses in, for example,
English and to some extent to allow
students to proceed at their own pace.
The standard of the law degree itself
must, however, be maintained at a level
equivalent to that of Australian law
schools.
“Law in a nutshell”
A t one time there was some fear in
the legal profession here that “law
in a nutshell” courses for clerks might
be provided by the Administration in
New Guinea, leading to some kind of
“ticket” to practise. The Law Council
expressed its concern to the Minister
that proper standards of legal training
should be adopted and as long ago as
October, 1962, the Department of Terri-
tories gave the following assurance from
the Acting Administrator: “While the
fears of some of the members of the
Law Council in respect of sub-pro-
fessional training are appreciated, I
would be pleased if you would assure
them that it is the unequivocal intention
of the Administration that those that
are admitted to practice before the
courts in this country, whatever their
racial origin, will be competently trained
by accepted professional standards.”
This assurance having been given, the
Law Council supports the establishment
of a law school in New Guinea and
does not expect all New Guinea lawyers
to be educated in law in Australia.
The early ones will have to be given
their legal education here and these early
qualified lawyers are very important
indeed in any legal profession. Their
importance is dramatically illustrated by
experience in the Sudan. Of the first
seven Sudanese lawyers trained locally
in the law of the Sudan, one is the
present Chief Justice, three became
Judges of the High Court, one became
Attorney-General, one was Minister for
Commerce and another became Foreign
Secretary.
In New Guinea, in the course of time,
much the same type of development is
possible.

CAMBODIA
Sir,
As a daughter of Australia, albeit for
the moment in exile, I do try to follow
The Bulletin although at some dis-
tance in space and time.
I must, however, confess to some dif-
ficulty in following the issue of Novem-
ber 30, 1963, which has just come into
my hands. On pages 46 and 47 you ran a
lengthy disquisition by that good-hearted
apologist for all things Chinese, Professor
C. P. Fitzgerald, in the guise of a review
of my husband’s book “The Centre of
the World”, demonstrating that the
threat of Communist China to South-
east Asia and Australia is wholly
“imaginary”. On page 5, under the title
“Cambodia”, appears an editorial which
views with alarm the opening of Cam-
bodia to Chinese Communist infiltration,
and which quotes, “Anyone who counts
on Communists respecting neutrality is
indeed engaged in a desperate gamble
59
In Plain English, is your conclusion
that the threat to Cambodia is wholly
imaginary—or what do you intend the
reader to conclude? It seems to me that
it is good to allow the reader to draw
his own conclusions, but there should be
a certain amount of consistency in the
facts you present for him to base his
conclusions upon.

MELON AND MADEIRA
Sir,
I thought there might be an idea in
this for our wine industry, when the rock
melons are in season every year.
Instead of being given afternoon tea
recently by an Austrian friend, I was
served with iced melon and a glass of
madeira. Properly featured in fashion-
able cafes, melon and madeira or some
other dessert wine could be popular
with the avant garde.

THE BIRDSVILLE TRACK
Sir,
The organisation referred to in “Keep-
ing Track of the Track” (18/1/64) is
in fact the Royal Automobile Associa-
tion of South Australia, not the Royal
Automobile Club of Australia.
The article demonstrated and per-
petuated the misunderstanding which
frequently occurs about the motorists’
organisation movement. For the sake
of the record, I would point out that
each State has an autonomous motorists’
organisation (some combining club and
service facilities, and some operating
only one or the other) and that all these
various organisations have a common
secretariat for Federal action in the Aus-
tralian Automobile Association. In this
case it is our own organisation, the RAA
of SA, which will survey the Birdsville
Track for the third time in recent years,
following the death of the Page family.
Before being sceptical of its value,
your writer, Mr Hall, and others might
take the trouble to find out what the
survey is about. This organisation, which
has long been an authority on motor
tourism in the outback, is well aware of
the uselessness of placing markers and
distance signs on certain sections of the
track where it doesn’t follow a fixed
route. We have in fact publicly stated
this opinion when a great deal of ill-
informed correspondence appeared in
the local press criticising the lack of
signposting.
The RAA survey is designed to bring
back up-to-date information so that
advice given to travellers will be given
on a knowledgeable basis. It will also
check on signposting previously estab-
lished by this Association.

GUNTER GRASS
Sir,
Your critic, Sybille Smith, in calling
Gunter Grass’s “Cat and Mouse” the
author’s “latest work” (25/1/64), reveals
an astonishing ignorance of what is
going on in Germany today in literature.
In fact, Grass’s latest work is “Hunde-
It has been pointed out to The
Bulletin that the article “The De-
fence Bureaucracy”, which was fea-
tured in last week's issue, was pub-
lished in such a manner as to give the
impression that it was contributed for
payment as an article to The
Bulletin by Dr Brian Beddie. It
was not. It was, as stated by The
Bulletin, a condensation of a much
longer and more detailed paper deli-
vered at the recent Summer School
of the Australian Institute of Political
Science. The condensation was made
by The Bulletin without consulta-
tion with Dr Beddie.


jahre” (“Dog Years”) which followed
“Cat and Mouse” and caused a sensation
when it appeared as long ago as around
August, 1963.
She places Grass in “Gruppe 47”
without stating that he absolutely de-
clined to sign this group’s so-called
“Spiegel-Resolution”. Further, she sub-
jects “Cat and Mouse” to a serious
examination and finds it a little less
successful than “The Tin Drum”, with-
out being aware that Grass himself dis-
claims “Cat and Mouse” as a serious
work, having written it as a potboiler to
fill in during the four years between his
really important works, “The Tin Drum”
and “Hundejahre”.
Miss Smith is quite incorrect in saying
that “there is no statement of attitude
to Nazi Germany”. On the contrary, the
author himself says that he sets out to
destroy the Nazis by ridicule.
BERTHOLD WAGNER
Model Farms (NSW).
[Sybille Smith writes: My review was
written in October, when news of the
publication of Grass’s new novel had not
reached Australia by the normal chan-
nels. As I was dealing with English
translations of Grass, this had little bear-
ing on what I wrote.
Having stressed the diversity and
absence of a common ideology in
“Gruppe 47”, I see no need for further
elaboration on the attitudes of individual
writers to specific issues.
Grass’s work does not need protection
from “subjection” to serious examina-
tion. I am aware that Grass regards
“Cat and Mouse” as less important than
the novels; an author’s evaluation of
his own work can hardly determine a
critic’s approach to it.
Grass’s view that ridicule is the only
way of attacking the Nazi regime is
expressed in the “Spiegel” article of
September 4, which I presume to be
Mr Wagner’s source of information. It
is not expressed in “Cat and Mouse”.]
THE RIVERINA
Sir,
I am surprised to note that your Mel-
bourne correspondent (25/1/64) alleges
that I believe that the “Riverina is
legally part of Victoria”. I believe no
such thing, and even if I did I would
still consider that the Riverina would be
better off as a self-governing State of the
Federation under the management of the
local people.
The Victorian Government sought the
advice of eminent counsel Edward
Mitchell, KC, and Theyre A. 5 8. Weigall,
KC in 1906. Their joint opinion was
that Victoria had no legal claim. In
1910 a succeeding government sought
the opinion of Sir Edward Carson, KC,
and Messrs. Poley and Rowlett, of the
English Bar. They also held that Victoria
could not establish a prima facie case
for the alteration of the existing
boundary between NSW and Victoria.
In the face of these opinions the Vic-
torian Government made a formal claim
on NSW in 1911 and this claim was
rejected on the basis of an opinion by
the NSW Solicitor-General, who sup-
ported the views of independent counsel.
As a layman, I would be most reluc-
tant to contest the opinions of these
distinguished gentlemen.

was printed as “stole.” I am expecting
a writ from the Captain’s ghost at any
minute.

COMMUNISM IN INDONESIA
Sir,
Professor Legge’s answer (18/1/64)
to my criticism of his article on Indo-
nesia is evasive and inaccurate. It also
contains appeals to authority unbecoming
to an academic.
(1) The writ of the Djakarta Govern-
ment does not run in many areas, despite
the professor’s assurances to the con-
trary. In many districts semi-independent
war lords do more or less what they like,
a fact highlighted in a recent seminar on
South-East Asia run by Geoffrey Fair-
bairn, and mentioned by Paul Johnson
in a previously quoted article in the
“New Statesman”. Village areas are
often virtually administered by PKI
Party branches.
(2) The Indonesian Army is largely
equipped with Soviet arms and per-
meated by Soviet “technicians”. This
constitutes Soviet military presence
similar to that in Cuba before the missiles
had been installed.
(3) To say that the PKI is no longer
a real Communist Party, having lost its
militancy, is an unfounded statement
similar to that made in the ’thirties by
Professor Lattimore that the Chinese
Communists were “mere agrarian re-
formers”. It is, of course, true that the
new mass-membership of PKI front
organisations is attracted to it not by
promises of revolutionary warfare but
via the Party’s massive programme of
social amelioration, resembling in this
respect the situation in Italy. Yet the
countervailing forces available in Italy
do not exist in Indonesia, and the Gov-
ernment apparatus is now so thoroughly
permeated by Communist agents that a
take-over on the Czechoslovak model,
without guerrilla warfare, is quite feas-
ible. Its timing will depend on purely
tactical global considerations. At the
present time the Communists support
Soekarno like a rope supporting a hang-
ing man.

SURFERS PARADISE
Sir,
Whilst appreciating your “Gold Coast
Politics” story (18/1/64), I regret the
use of the sub - heading “Residents
organise against tourists” as, in some
instances, the impression may be formed
that we have something against tourists.
On the contrary, our city’s whole
economy is geared to please and satisfy
the tourist, for without them we cease
to exist.
However, it is this lack of apprecia-
tion of the tourist by both local and
State Governments that is causing un-
precedented interest in the Gold Coast
City Council elections on May 2. Surfers
Paradise business people fully realise
the necessity for a virile public works
programme, but see no future in a
“ghost town” of fully paved streets with
nobody to walk in them.

LIQUOR FOR ABORIGINES
Sir,
Your article titled “The Cattleman’s
Lament” (18/1/64) is, to my mind,
biased and unfair. I'm a cattleman
and, usually, do not use aboriginal labor,
but I cannot too strongly condemn any
move that will give them easier access
to liquor. Not having generations of
alcohol-users behind them, they just
cannot handle it.
It will not be doing them a good turn
to relax drinking laws in their favor, as
instance the case of Albert Namatjira,
who was well behaved and happy until
he was taught to drink by his so-called
white friends.
I am against soft-headed sentimental-
ism but wholeheartedly in favor of
sensible moves to benefit the aboriginal
population of Australia.

has been bedevilled by two factors. The
purists have insisted on adherence to a
rigid traditionalism in the medium,
whereas the exploiters have their eyes
fixed on the not-too-distant glint of a
small fortune. At its worst, purism
involves a fatal loss of contact with con-
temporary audiences while commercial-
ism inevitably leads to a breakdown of
an absolutely necessary link with the
music’s origins and history.
Australian singers of Australian songs
today stand at a kind of cross-roads.
A few are certain of their direction but
most are a study of confusion, their
ears bludgeoned right, left and centre
by the mostly contradictory arguments
of academic researchers, agents, record
companies, politicians and even the
indefinable “folk” themselves.
Ostensibly, all have one aim in
common that of popularising Aus-
tralia’s own songs. So far, unlike the
key figures of the American folk move-
ment, only those willing to make the
kind of concessions show business has
always demanded of artists uncertain
of their position have been able to rise
above a kind of bed-sitting-room financial
status. The others, with the case histories
of Pete Seeger, Joan Baez and company
memorised like some musical catechism,
keep their belts tight and pray that the
American pattern will be repeated here.
That pattern is the gradual discrediting
on a remarkably widespread level of
the commercialisers of folk music, a
list which must now include the once
trail - blazing Kingston Trio and the
latter-day Harry Belafonte.
The only local examples of mass
communication media which appear to
have relaxed fears and shown any
willingness to suspend a few prejudices
are the record companies, nearly all of
which have just produced, or are in the
process of producing, relatively un-
adulterated performances of Australian
folk songs. Television stations, particu-
larly, are still very apprehensive and
the folk singer who bucks at upbeat
tempos, orchestral backings and celestial
choirs is not likely to get many engage-
ments. Radio likewise —apart from one
worthwhile locally produced folk-music
programme (impossibly late on Sunday
night, along with poetry and readings
from the Old Testament) and one
commercial station programme which
petered out recently.
Most Australians are aware of only
one name in connection with Australian
folk music: Lionel Long. Has he, then,
achieved the awaited breakthrough? In
one way, yes; in a more important way,
no. In fact one of the current absurdities
of the local folk music scene is the
position of this pleasant-voiced, unde-
manding personality of television, radio
and nightclubs who by shrewd public
relations has built up an image as “Aus-
tralia’s top folk singer.” By even the
broadest, most indulgent definition he
is no such animal.
A nybody who has listened to his mostly
saccharine, bowdlerised “interpre-
tations” of our ballads and songs must
sense that he simply wouldn’t be listened
to seriously (and isn't) in any of the
places where folk music is now
flourishing the coffee houses, which
heaven knows are unpretentious enough,
and other venues where folk singing
has reached an audience. Never dis-
cussed, but undeniably popular with
those for whom this form of Australian
music offers a gentle alternative to the
inanities of the pop parade, he continues
to be televised, broadcast, publicised and
exported as the chief representative of
local folk culture.
The irony is that equally experienced
and considerably more talented folk
singers such as Alec Hood and Gary
Shearston in Sydney and David Lums-
den and Dennis Gibbons in Melbourne,
all contemporaries of Long, have for
years been getting all the significant
Australian folk music jobs going not
only within the cliquey folk music circles
—and yet almost totally lack recognition
by the producers of our mass media.
Local folk singers are still more
occupied in a search for style as opposed
to reformist ambitions, a style true to
tradition but alive with contemporary
references. For them the concept of
folk song as a “living newspaper of
history,” a document illuminating pre-
cious insights to moods and mores which
conventional historical sources cannot
cope with, is at present more important
than most other considerations.
But lately, on the folk horizons, there
is appearing unmistakably a new kind
of “folk” song which is thoroughly
contemporary, mostly urban and follow-
ing the American pattern.
THEATRE
Kidnapped
Listen to the Wind. Angela Ainley
Jeans, with music and lyrics by
Vivian Ellis. Arts Theatre. Mel-
bourne.
‘ T isten to the Wind,” an English
musical play for children, has
what many adult musicals sadly lack:
an exciting plot. Three young cousins,
Emma, Harriet and Jeremy, are kid-
napped by gipsies, but, with the aid of
a magic musical box, they are able to
summon the aid of the kindly Wind
people who whisk them away to the
Kingdom of the Winds.
Like most English children’s stories,
“Listen to the Wind” is set in a world
which is quite outside the experience of
Australian children: the world of
nurseries, governesses and butlers. It is
a world which must seem to them as
purely imaginary as the Kingdom of the
Winds, and no doubt it is accepted as
such. As in all the best fairy stories,
fantasy is laced with realism. Most of
the adult characters, whether they be
goodies or baddies, human or fairy, are
presented as faintly absurd. There is a
very endearing Gale Bird (played with
great charm and vitality by Edwin Ride)
who falls down on the job when he gets
cramp in his wing but later redeems
himself by rescuing Harriet and Jeremy
from the villainous Black Thunder
Cloud. Equally attractive is Miranda
the sea-witch, a retired mermaid, played
with splendid bouncing vulgarity by
Yvonne Kosky. Joy Mudge, the pro-
ducer, has trained three sets of children
for the very demanding roles of Emma,
Harriet and Jeremy. The three I saw
managed their parts with remarkable
stamina and poise.

Atrophy
George. Q Theatre Group. AMP
Theatre. Sydney.
Q Theatre Group, the only lunch-
hour theatre to have endured into
the new year, has not fulfilled the
promise of its first production. For
Robert McDarra’s loose and unimagin-
ative staging of “George” is no more
than an occasional success. Whereas
“The Dumb Waiter” struck the right
balance between playing for laughs and
doing justice to the text, the rich comedy
in “George” fails to amuse because it is
too emphatically sought.
Pat Hooker has made a slick adapta-
tion of John Anthony West’s bizarre
tale about the typical American male,
struck one night with creeping atrophy.
His alternately terrified or awed, meek
or petulant reaction to his plight, dictated
by his wife’s fluctuating attitudes towards
it, point to the common malaise of the
modern man-in-the-suburbs a smug
mediocrity undisturbed by ambition. Ben
Gabriel gave a satisfactorily one-dimen-
sional performance as the' one-dimen-
sional George. Only in the very funny
moment where he excitedly describes the
one adventure of his day, the nightly
snack between the late show and the
late late show, did the humor go beyond
the farce and gag-lines, and become
rightly pathetic.
But neither Mr Gabriel nor Doreen
Warburton as the wife Marjory seemed
comfortable playing comedy. Both
appeared a little uncertain, and over-
compensated by descending on the laugh
lines with self-conscious determination,
and by too obviously anticipating re-
sponses they sometimes didn’t get. When
one remembers Miss Warburton all but
saving “The Season at Sarsaparilla” she
is clearly miscast here. Again only at
one point, where she realises too late
that their nights of love are over, was
she wholly convincing.
Nevertheless, the ultimate blame for
the play’s only limited success is
McDarra’s. The acting is certainly never
less than adequate and the script itself
is very amusing (it is more a revue
sketch than a play). But the production
is colorless. It lacks the fast pace that
comedy, particularly absurd comedy,
must have. If McDarra can tighten his
show and keep it moving, then the
comedy of the situation will emerge
without the rather heavy-handed under-
lining of the casual wit.
WILLIAM DANIELS
No Style
The Importance Of Being Earnest.
Oscar Wilde. Old Tote Theatre.
TVespite the polished granite , quality
of Wilde’s great comedy which
shone as brilliantly as ever, “The Im-
portance of Being Earnest” came up
with some pretty limp moments. I
hasten to add that it also has some
charming felicities, so that on balance
the visit to Kensington is worthwhile.
The reason for the frequent weak
moments is that original sin of Sydney
theatre lack of style. And style
means just this, in theatrical terms: that
the producer knows exactly the way he
wants the piece played and sees to it
that every player in his company knows
the way and follows the way. There is,
after all, more to Wilde than the surface
glister of the incomparable dialogue.
The play is a satire—a deadly, damnably
funny one at that —on a more than
somewhat sick fin de siecle society (al-
though in the playing of it such serious
analyses ought to be banished).
Wilde’s effervescent game of verbal
ping-pong is the essence of good comedy,
and when achieved, the entire effect of
the play emerges plot and sub-text,
the elegant surface, the satirical barbs
on the underside.
To my eye, only Sophie Stewart’s
Lady Bracknell reached consistently
a correct level amongst the leads, with
Ron Haddrick and Reginald Livermore,
as Jack and Algernon, achieving enough
moments of pure fun to make one wish
that their playing would catch fire.
Amongst the other roles, Ellis Irving’s
Dr Chasuble was delightful—his habita-
tion of a wonderfully artificial world
wasn’t just cause of serene laughter for
the audience, but a perfect example for
the other players. Robin Lovejoy’s set-
tings are in superb style.

FILMS
Soliloquy
Si. Director, Federico Fellini. Lido
Theatre. Sydney.
title is an opus number, record-
ing the fact that director Fellini has
hereby completed eight films and two
segments of other films. (They include
the sensational “La Dolce Vita”, the
touching “Nights of Caberia” and the
brilliantly inconsequential first section of
“Boccaccio 70”.)
The absence of a title in the normal
sense is presumably meant to indicate
the absence of a film in the ordinary
sense. For this fascinating phantas-
magoria is the account of the non-
making of a non-film; a sort of
psychiatrist’s-couch monologue from a
director who cannot decide what sort of
film to make.
The central character (played with
wry charm by Marcello Mastroianni) is
just such a film director in just that
dilemma, and there is no need to doubt
that this is substantially Fellini’s vision
of himself. The film shows him, con-
valescent in a vast and over-decorated
hotel (shades of “Marienbad”!), beset by
pretentious hangers-on, by a vulgar
mistress and a chilly, too-discerning wife;
beset as well by artistic self-doubts,
chronic indecision, disturbing memories
and wishful fantasies (in one of which
he hangs a critic).
The foremost quality by which “8J”
holds attention, despite its formlessness,
its dull patches and its almost laughable
egoism, is Fellini's sheer mastery of his
craft. It is a triumphant vindication of
the principle that film is primarily and
always a visual medium; that a motion
picture’s first requirement is to keep
moving and create pictures. This is the
most obvious difference between “8±”
and “Marienbad”: in “8i” the pictures
are so varied, interesting and skilfully
juxtaposed that one is nearly always
eager to see what comes next; in
“Marienbad”, for all the glossy photo-
graphy, one soon becomes numbly re-
signed to fact that what comes next is
likely to be much the same as what
came last.
Contrasted with the lively, richly
peopled, essentially good-humored Italian
film, “Marienbad” seems in the memory
all the more sterile and depopulated.
Fellini’s film is above all an affirmation
of life and a rejection of intellectual
affectations; the imaginary hanging of
the verbosely metaphysical scriptwriter-
critic is only one of the symbols of this;
the same point is hammered home in the
final scene, when the director abandons
the film he was going to make and starts
to make a new film, assembling as his

MARTIN LONG
TELEVISION
Six Years
The Home Front. Channel 9, Sydney.
Tf it did nothing else, “The Home
Front” settled a controversy that was
aired recently in one of the Sydney
newspapers—whether John Curtin asked
for US help during the war, or just
found General MacArthur on his door-
step one morning. “I asked . . . and
make no apology for it,” was the sub-
stance of the then Prime Minister's state-
ment, revived for us from the files of
Cinesound.
We saw a good deal of John Curtin
in “The Home Front”, we heard General
Gordon Bennett's comments on his own
resignation, General MacArthur orating
at a couple of dinners, radio's Ada and
Elsie entertaining munition workers, and
we saw soldiers in training, the “Yanks”
arriving, and Australian industry grow-
ing up suddenly.
I can imagine some of the problems
confronting Bob Raymond and Michael
Ramsden, who had to select from the
weekly newsreels over six years.
In those terms, they did a good job.
The failure of “The Home Front” was
the inbuilt one that you can’t please
everybody, and the production team did
not please me for a very Australian
reason. They were rather leisurely. For
once, it might have been preferable to
have had a quickfire approach.
There are many ways in which a
documentary of this kind can be speeded
up, given some excitement, made to
embrace more sights and sounds of the
time. Quick cutting from scene to scene
is one way, with a lively narration. The
use of underlying music is another, and
it was a time of great change in popular
music, on the home front. Nor can I
see why the whole of such a docu-
mentary has to be drawn from the film
library, why actors can’t be used to
fill in some of the missing impressions.
So while “The Home Front” was a
creditable first effort in splicing bits of
old film, I hope that when another
documentary of this kind is made—and
they are valuable examinations of our
past—the team will innovate much more.

The Last Conflict
Was the sacrifice of Australian youth worthwhile?
By EK DUM
Australian War History: The Final
Campaigns, Gavin Long. Aus-
tralian War Memorial, Canberra.
355.
rpms seventh military volume closes the
-*• story of the fighting by the Aus-
tralian Military Forces in World War 11,
covering essentially the period from
September, 1944, to the formal surrender
of Japan in US Missouri in Tokyo Bay
on September 2, 1945, in the month after
the second atomic bomb was dropped
on Nagasaki.
It is the story of what might be
called, from the Japanese point of view,
the Stalingrad period of the war. In the
South West Pacific during that period
huge Japanese forces were held in
pockets, the manpower strength of which
at the beginning of the period was
grossly under-estimated and the fighting
capacity over-estimated. In fact, there
were 30,000 in Bougainville, 93,000 in
New Britain and 31,000 in Wewak area.
They were ultimately as helpless for
logistical reasons after the period of the
attacks on Okinawa and the Philippines
(October 10-11, 1944) and the Naval
Battle of the Leyte Gulf on October 26,
as von Paulus after his fuel transport
routes were cut off by Jack Frost and
his force was sealed up round Stalingrad
by inability to move his vehicles, and
destroyed.
The opening chapters of this final
Army volume are devoted to the relation
of the curiously muddled conflict of
purpose and manoeuvre between the
various allies involved in the Pacific.
The author lends these conflicts little
clarity despite the fact that he goes
into great detail. They certainly formed
a confusion complicated by personal
likes and dislikes and national considera-
tions which sometimes overrode the
more direct purpose of winning the
war as quickly as possible. Also —so
far as Australia was concerned the
political divisions of thought within the
dominant Australian Labor Party had
a greatly complicating influence.
But the inner political conflicts of
the ALP and Curtin’s surrender on the
question of sending militia with the
vanguard advancing with Japan are not
discussed as they need to be to make
the whole situation understandable in
proper perspective. It is not enough to
limit the review mainly to the conflicts
between Blarney and his critics and the
Americans and his generals. With the
latter he found it all too easy to quarrel
in the difficult fix, vis-a-vis the home
Government and the Americans in
which he found himself.
The final doom of any idea that Aus-
tralians might be among the military
land forces who would set foot in con-
quering battles on the shores of Japan
was extinguished by the Americans’ lack
of need to use Australian troops
and by the insistence of the Australian
Government (generated largely by the
unions of the type of Watersiders and
Ironworkers and Coalminers, then all
dominated by a Communist leadership)
on the necessity of reducing Australian
military strength. This produced a net
reduction in Army strength between
October 1, 1943, and June 30, 1945, of
approximately 90,000 men. And the
chaos of the coal industry debilitated
the Commonwealth’s value as a base,
since coal was a key material of trans-
port and equipment and maintenance of
forces.
Tn these circumstances the Americans
-*■ shied away from Australia; and their
decisions made the history which Mr
Long includes in his last volume very
different from what it might have been
if the AIF had become part of the
main offensive forces moving in on
Japan. It must be admitted that it would
have been illogical in all the circum-
stances if the Americans had been
prepared to count for ultimate offensive
purposes seeing especially that both
they and the British had absolute con-
scription for all battle zones—on the
manpower of a nation which had reduced
its army strength by about 90,000 in a
year and which was not prepared to
allow its compulsorily enlisted militia to
be used above the Equator even for the
purpose of redeeming the shame of
Singapore and rescuing the Eighth
Division in Changi.
One can leave ambition to exclude the
British and make the Pacific Ocean an
American lake out of the question. The
Americans after the fall of Germany
had men and material of their own to
burn and were able, for example, to
fling 80.000 men against 20,000 Japanese
on the beaches of Iwo Jima; to provide
themselves with a heavy bomber base
for use against the Japanese mainland;
and 180,000 men and going on for
2,000,000 artillery shells —about 900 per
hour for three months —and one of the
heaviest naval forces used in history,
against Okinawa.
So that all history had to offer the
Australians as the climax to six years
of fighting was a series of attritional
operations against “S ta 1 i n grad e d”
Japanese troops cut off from supplies,
medicines, natural rations and hope of
rescue and for whom the future held
only destruction by nature and
exhaustion.
Mr Long is not very illuminating
about larger issues, and scarcely illumina-
ting at all about political ones which
are perhaps being left to another,
despite their military consequences. He
does discuss at length the petty
differences of the period between generals
in detail out of proportion to their
intrinsic importance.
He does fully canvass the question
of whether or not the policy of actual
attrition against the enclaves of sur-
rounded Japanese which is described in
detail, was worth the sacrifice and the
undying heroism of troops involved.
Yet he dismisses the deaths of more
than 1000 young Australians in the
process of fighting the final campaigns
of Bougainville and New Guinea, as a
“grave loss yet fewer than the number
of Australians who would be killed in
the following year in automobile
accidents, 1206”.
He admits that each of the two
Japanese armies on Bougainville and
round Wewak had spent most of its
strength, and was unlikely to repeat
against the Australians its previous disas-
trous counter-attacks against the Ameri-
cans. Also, he remarks that “indeed, their
leaders afterwards said they welcomed
the Australian offensives, as giving their
armies a useful task to perform for the
Emperor.”
He declares that the major decisions
affecting the operations were made by
Blarney. That was in a period when
he was employing larger forces than
he had at first desired—which were
spending their strength in unnecessarily
aggressive operations, apart from Borneo.
Spending it too, with shortage of
shipping and equipment, since the overall
Allied command was not at all enthusi-
astic about the nature of the New Guinea
campaign.
There was no alternative to an
aggressive policy for a force such as
the Australian one held back in New
Guinea.
To use such a force, composed
largely of battle-scarred troops, and even
more battle-scarred and ambitious
leaders who had fought everything on
legs from Free French and Italians to


the Afrika Korps, merely to sit down
in '.vet jungle and watch a tempting lot
of gunfodder wilt and die out, was like
putting wild cats into a bag with a
litter of poodles and instructing r them
to stay still and let the poodles rot.
A policy of passivity would have
resulted in mutiny at the front, and
near riot at home among an army of
critics only too ready to find fault with
the Australian high command. Even
some disgruntled generals and a large
batch of revengeful politicians would
have found their opportunity in such a
situation to attack Blarney and destroy
him.
His position was doubly unfortunate
in that MacArthur insisted on including
the I Corps sent to Borneo for offensive
operations preliminary to the invasion
of Java, under his own direct GHQ
command, while Blarney’s responsibility
was now restricted to administrative
command of the Australian forces in
general, and de facto operational
command only of the formations left
behind as holding forces in New Guinea
area.
This was a logical outcome of the
attitude of the Australian Government
to conscription and overseas service.

Stories. Ed. Bill Wannan. Lans-
downe Press. 355.
Two Ways Meet. (Stories of Migrants
in Australia.) Ed. Louise E. Rora-
bacher. Cheshire. 30s.
So obvious you wonder why it hasn’t
been done often before —these col-
lections of Australian short stories are
limited to a single subject apiece, and
immediately the somewhat dreary an-
thology we know has had not so much
a face lift as a completely new skin.
Wannan, for instance, has no need to
give us what, in his opinion (and that
of most of his predecessors), is the Very
Best Yarn Lawson Ever Wrote. He
simply prints a splendid little sketch
called “Bush Cats”. It is only one of
many stories here which would have to
be omitted from comprehensive an-
thologies of The Very Best, but how
good they are in an appropriate setting.
This sort of selection forces its editor
back to sources whence he returns with
unfamiliar names and tales as good as
“The Breaking” by R. Wilkes Hunter or
“The White Dingo” by Younger Hill-
man.
Wannan has also included a fascinat-
ing excerpt from Alexander Harris’
“Settlers and Convicts” and another
from a long out-of-print book by Charles
Rowcroft based on his experiences as a
settler in Tasmania between 1821 and
1824. Sometimes, of course, the stories
printed happen to be among the best
work of the authors concerned—Cecil
Mann’s “The Pelican” and Roland
Robinson’s “Death of a Brumby” are
included.
Some writers are represented by
several tales, Henry G. Lamond leading
(as is his right) with three. I suppose
nearly every reader will regret some
omission or other one supposes Eve
Langley’s “The Pea Pickers” might have
yielded a usable chapter or two and
I miss Douglas Stewart’s “The Walking
Sticks.” But to quibble too much is un-
grateful although criticism must be made
of Robin Hill’s often coarse-textured
illustrations which are sometimes un-
forgivably inaccurate—Old Ben in
George Farwell’s “The Darling Cod”
lacks his “heavy-lidded galah’s eyes” in
his picture; while Mr Grigg in Mann’s
“The Pelican” looks like a hefty boy
of seventeen when we imagine him as
middle aged and know he is thin because
“On . . . Sundays he dressed what there
was of him in cream flannel trousers.”
Although not specifically a children’s
book these wild-life tales make splendid
reading for youngsters.
Many readers will be surprised not
only at the quantity but the excellent
quality of the stories about migrants in
“Two Ways Meet”. The Editor “is,
appropriately, not an Australian. She
is Professor of English at Purdue Uni-
versity, Indiana, with a keen interest in
social history as it is reflected in litera-
ture. She spent six months in Australia
in 1962 to find material for this book”.
Her Introduction is a most able summing
up of the Australian scene in literature
and society.
For sufficient reasons the book is
limited to events of this century. Nathan
Spielvogel is the earliest born of the
contributors, but his “Mr Bronstein
Learns His Lesson” opens in 1914 and
the greater number of works concern
post-1945 immigrants. Twenty-two short
stories are printed each so good of its
kind that making comparisons between
them in a brief space becomes invidious.
My only regret is that “Riders in the
Chariot” (which at some levels is the
exercise par excellence upon this theme)
is unrepresented.

are two well-written prose
romances by Australian authoresses,
perhaps done with women library readers
in mind, who should put them on their
lists.
Each concerns an involuted family, a
heroine, and a villainess who is the
matriarchal organiser of the clan. Each
finishes with the villainess defeated and
the heroine escaping emotionally and
geographically to her own true love and
a life of less intensity. One can hear the
girls breathing out with relief as their
creators briskly turn off the taps on the
last page.
There is much conversation and
characterisation stylised in the romantic
tradition. The main figures are arche-
types, larger than life, and the stress
on family lineage gives them an archaic
quality, although both stories are set in
the present. “The Tilsit Inheritance” is
the more elaborate of the two. and takes
us from the West Indies, to New York,
to a pottery in Dorset, and back to the
islands. “The Wild Grapes” is set in the
environs of Adelaide, complete with
“Advertiser” and an almost credible
Adelaide family. Both books provide
diverting entertainment.

The Gift. Vladimir Nabokov. Weiden-

The Incomparable Atuk. Mordecai
Richler. Deutsch. 20s.
Tohn Updike is generally acknow-
** ledged, quite rightly, as one of
America’s “significant” young writers.
He is one of a select group who have
inherited several hundred years of
American literary evolution at the point
when its major concern is with the study
of modern man under the stress of
psychic pressures peculiar to modern
society. Updike has served notice of his
concern with this central theme in per-
ceptive earlier work, most recently in
“Rabbit Run” and in his short stories.
Now, in “The Centaur”, he has at-
tempted to probe deeper by using the
device of historical parallel.
For his parallel of the predicament
of modern man, Updike has turned to
the Greek myths for the centaur Chiron
who, innocent, was selected to expiate
Prometheus's sin of the thefr of fire.
Painfully wounded by an arrow yet
unable to die, the immortal centaur longs
for death until the gods hear his prayer
and take away his pain and immortality,
enabling him to die “like any wearied
man.”
George Caldwell, a genera] science
teacher at Olinger High School, Pennsyl-
vania, who receives an arrow through
the ankle from one of the children in
his classroom, seems to have little in
common with Chiron, “noblest of the
centaurs.” Caldwell is self-depreciating,
unsure, doubting even his own abilities
and his religion, and unable to corn-


municate with those closest to him, his
wife and his son. He sums up ms agony,
“A tragic animal appeared—called man.”
Yet just as the innocent centaur is
doomed by the actions of another
centaur, so Caldwell is sacrificed to his
students, whose innocent savagery de-
mandingly drains his life away.
Caldwell’s fate becomes inextricably
bound up with that of the centaur as
parallels emerge. The symbols engulf him
•—Peter (Prometheus), his son; Cassie
(Ceres), his wife; Zimmerman (Zeus) the
headmaster; Vera (Venus) the sexual
symbol are the most obvious. The
duration of Caldwell’s agony is much
shorter than Chiron’s, the action con-
cerning a three-day period when he is
stranded away from home with his son
Peter. Father and son share the un-
folding of the story, their concern for
each other hidden by their tragic
inability to communicate.
How successful has Updike’s
symbolism been? The literary device is
a familiar one and can also be a telling
one; yet here there is a feeling that the
parallel is forced and never quite as
natural as, say, that with lob in the
play “J. 8.” But if the essay into symbol-
ism doesn’t quite ring true, there are
important compensations even beyond
the prose rich in metaphor and simile.
Caldwell’s sufferings under the catalyst
of his own mental processes are
manifestly real and Updike’s insight into
the mind of the boy Peter is particularly
perceptive. A painful tangle of emotions
is laid bare embarrassment for his
father, shame at his own physical imper-
fections, the rising needs of approaching
manhood, the final confusion being
added with the realisation that there
are “no proofs, no miracle cures”.
Probably the importance of Vladimir
Nabokov’s “Lolita” in American letters
lay not in its conscious affront to the
Puritan ethic or even in its subtly satirical
representation of twentieth - century
American mores, but in the fact that it
became the key which unlocked a
treasure chest of Nabokov novels. Since
“Lolita’s” first publication in English in
the United States in 1958, there have'
followed no fewer than seven Nabokov
works, progressively revealing further
facets of his remarkable versatility; the
composite picture is of a writer of intel-*
lect with a greater ability to make use of
the intricate cadences and nuances of the
English language probably than any
other writer since James Joyce. And
this from a man who acknowledges
English as only his third language!
“The Gift,” a translation by Michael
Scammell (with the collaboration of
Nabokov himself) of Nabokov’s last
novel written in Russian (in Berlin
between 1935-37), adds nothing new to
our knowledge of him, but it is of great
clinical interest as a stage in his develop-
ment. He is still bound to a degree by
the traditional form of the'Russian novel,
but there are examples of the biting
satire and gentle wit which later made
“Lolita” and “Pnin” memorable. “The
Gift” is hardly a novel in the classical
sense; it is rather a platform from which
Nabokov can conduct a highly know-
ledgeable dissertation on Russian
literature through the eyes of Fyodor
Godunov-Cherdyntsev, a young Russian
poet-writer living (as did Nabokov him-
self) among Russian emigres in Berlin
in the early twenties. The heroine of
the novel, Nabokov makes it clear, is
not Zina Mertz whom Fyodor woos, but
Russian literature; and the aesthetic
Fyodor makes fearless assessments of a
whole range of Russian writers, here
praising Pushkin and Gogol, here cutting
down to size Chernyshevski, hero and
spokesman of the 19th-century radicals,
with scalpel-edged epithets.
Canadian writer Mordecai Richler
suffers badly by mere proximity to
Updike and Nabokov. His voice is heard
at all only because it is one of so few
raised in the particularly barren wilder-
ness of Canadian letters. “The Incom-
parable Atuk” is a step into the new
field of satirical farce for Richler, whose
previous works were acknowledged to
have serious intentions. The object of
the satire is American domination of
Canada’s life, economy and letters and
the protagonist is Atuk, an “on the ball”
Eskimo poet who takes the most direct
form of “symbolic revenge” on a repre-
sentative of the country which has been
“eating Canada alive.” There are some
amusing moments, especiallv for those
who can recognise caricatured Canadian
public figures, but the result is more
farcical than satirical.

TCVdr me the most moving poem, in last
-*• year’s “Australian Poetry” is James
McAuley’s “Pieta”, and it is not in
keeping with the main mood of the
anthology. It seems the editor has
favored comments-on-the-contemporary-
situation . poems—poems about what it
is like living with such everyday things
as city roofs, vacations, museums, sites
for sale, and up-country pubs. A. D.
Hope’s long poem tells us why long
poems are not written in the twentieth
century.
Though one of Judith Wright’s con-
tributions is concerned with “Typists in
the Phoenix Building”, a subject in
keeping with the book’s tendency, its
range puts it above the general level.
Among the other good poems are
Douglas Stewart’s “The Peahen,” J. R.
Rowland’s “At Noosa,” Vincent
Buckley’s “Parents,” Francis Webb’s
“The Tower,” and A. D. Hope’s poem
which I have already mentioned, “Con-
versation with Calliope.”
“Conversation with Calliope” takes 31
pages. It contains some fine passages,
and has an easy precision at times
reminiscent of Swift’s best verse. It also
has these lines which some future trade
union of poets might put on its letters
to editors:
Ask what I get as
Poet! —at a random guess
For poems forged with sweat and
tears,
Four hundred pounds in forty years!
However, it is possible to be a
dedicated poet despite a lack of income
from poetry. A. D. Hope is obviously
a dedicated poet. On the other hand,
Geoffrey Grigson, Robin Gurr, James
Gidley and Francis Brabazon have one
important feature in common. Their
works suggest that they are not primarily
preoccupied with poetry. Perhaps
Geoffrey Grigson’s real vocation is
studying cave paintings.
I can only assume that Geoffrey
Grigson worked out a formula for
writing poetry many years ago. And he
has been determined to keep fairly con-
sistently to this formula all through his
poetry-writing life. For nearly forty
years his colloquial style has remained
flat and unemotional. He avoids human
problems as much as possible, and
prefers an inventory of observations
based on landscapes and inanimate
objects generally. I believe Geoffrey
Grigson enjoys writing poetry in this
way. I imagine his enjoyment is compar-
able to the enjoyment sensible people
achieve when drinking good port after a
meal. Anyway, there is a certain amount
of after-dinner complacency running
through this volume.
A fair example of Geoffrey Grigson’s
consistent inventory-style is this extract
from “Under the Cliff: the Farm”:
Once smoothly, smoothly curved this
meadow
Where lumps of nettle lay their
shadow
And side-step, under the long wall
of leaves,
Rabbits to the round-flowered
elders:
Sheep in their antique attitude
hump in


The gateway. Thatch thins under
the elder,
Daws chuckle; and the bile-green
yews, swished
By the mournful summer winds,
continue.
The collection has a brief change of
tone during a love sequence. Yet even
here I do not feel that Geoffrey Grigson
was really involved in the incident:
though the involvement could have been
deeper than aspects of the poems
indicate:
This may be the final poem
I can write about you.
If l had sense, no doubt
I’d shove this paper in the rain . . .
Another diversion is a short verse
play called “The Islanders” in which
Geoffrey Grigson deals with escape,
history and self-deception. It is clever
and Eliotic.
Robin Gurr, apart from writing a
book of verse, is a singer, composer
and sculptor. And all the praise for
Robin Gurr’s book must go to the
publishers, Edwards & Shaw. “Song is
a Mirror” has been treated handsomely
by its designers. From then on, however,
a familiar reviewer’s remark is applicable
—if only the contents could have been
as good as the container! Here is a
sample of Robin Gurr’s verse:
Silence softly
filled the air;
light of moon dropped
freshly fair.
James Gidley’s very thin collection
has one or two insights. “Suva” is
pleasant and much less “poetic” than
other things in the book. But I only
hope that James Gidley is more dedicated
to medicine than he is to poetry.
And Francis Brabazon is dedicated
to Meher Baba “who knowing every-
thing of the East & West & North &
South brought together the East and the
West in his love.” “The East-West
Gathering” celebrates Meher Baba in
poetry and prose, and tells us that “some
three months before the First of
November Nineteen-sixty-two, God-Man
Meher Baba sent out invitations to more
than three thousand of his lovers to
come to Poona and enjoy his company
for four days.” Yet this did not include
the resident lovers in Poona and sur-
rounding districts.

Edmund Spenser and George Eliot:
A Critical Excursion. James
McAuley. The University of Tas-
mania, Hobart. 4s. 6d.
monograph is the text of James
A McAuley’s Inaugural Lecture as
Professor of English in the University of
Tasmania. What might have been the
occasion for a solemn academic homily
must clearly have been the scene of a
lively encounter between the new pro-
fessor and his subject an encounter
designed more to illustrate his qualities
of mind than to set out any formal
programme for the conduct of his
department. The sub-title of the lecture,
“A Critical Excursion,” indicates the
easy informality of its approach; yet
the whole performance has enough
weight and substance to suggest the
shape of the man —poet, critic, and
teacher —who stands behind it.
McAuley the poet can be sensed even
in his prose style; its combination of
elegance, toughness, and economy recalls
the characteristic quality of much of
his verse. This is beautiful writing by
virtue not of any “purple passages” but
of its firm and unobtrusive discipline.
A grace note is added to the discipline
by the use of St Teresa of Avila as a
constant point of reference in the
development of the argument; again,
the choice of such a figure springs
directly from McAuley’s most personal
commitments.
McAuley the critic is there in the
nimbleness with which he proceeds from
point to point in the literary landscape.
There is an air of deliberate bravado
in electing to compare two such unlikely
figures as Edmund Spenser and George
Eliot; yet such is his expertise in exegesis
that one is convinced of the propriety
of the comparison. In the end, indeed,
the discussion of “The Faerie Queene,”
Book 111, Cantos 9 and 10, and “Middle-
march” is seen to have been undertaken
not simply for its own sake. It leads to
the formulation of a general critical
theory—the value of non-realistic art
and its superiority, on occasion, to
realistic art.
McAuley the teacher provides the
framework for the whole lecture a
speculation on the relation between past
and present and, more specifically, on
the role of scholarship in the teaching
of literature. His conclusion is that
“scholarship is an essential part of
humanism. We cannot know unless we
are docile; we cannot understand unless
we are willing to let works of art first
speak to us on their own terms.” But
perhaps more important than the formal
conclusion to the lecture is a quality
which informs it from start to finish.
It is a quality which I take to be the
chief desideratum in anybody professing
a humane discipline—a largeness of
mind capable, at once, of operating
effectively within and transcending the
limits of the chosen subject.

Paranoia
Horse Under Water. Len Deighton.
Cape. 20s.
is Len Deighton’s second spy-
thriller. Of the first, the sober “New
Statesman” said, “There has been no
brighter arrival on the shady scene since
Graham Greene started entertaining.”
But the comparison is rather misleading:
Greene’s hero, like Eric Ambler’s, is an
innocent who unwillingly gets caught up
in intrigue. He finds himself in a looking-
glass world where the fantasies of
paranoia suddenly come true; but he is
himself palpably a real person, and the
reader remains naturally identified with
him.
lan Fleming’s stories are quite
different, and to identify with James
Bond is an altogether inferior kind of
fantasy. Deighton is better than Fleming,
but it is with him that “Horse Under
Water” invites comparison. The anony-
mous hero has a lot in common with
Bond: both are super-efficient pro-
fessionals, omnicompetent but loaded
with special expertise; both (perhaps it
is a professional prerequisite?) are
knowing men on food and drink. The
adventures of X (to give him a name)
are as exotic as Bond’s, and involve
such familiar Fleming properties as
sunken treasure, frogmen, drug-traffic,
and master-minds.
In fairness to Deighton it should be
said that his story is nowhere near as
absurd as Fleming’s are, and that it is
better managed. Further, while Bond is
not always as nasty as they say, at his
nicest he is not as nice as X: who at
his nicest strains hard to be as nice as
Philip Marlowe. He does not seem to
have realised that that hero is peerless
because he is so constantly and out-
spokenly nice; but at times X does quite
well, adopting Marlowe's attitudes to
wealth, power and corruption, and
indeed speaking often in Marlowe's very
voice of these things: the X-Deighton
team manages at times a brilliant
pastiche of the Marlowe-Chanaier purple
prose.
This all makes “Horse Under Water”
much better than Fleming; but compared
with Chandler, to whom it is so much
indebted, or among spy-thrillers to the
best of Ambler and Greene, it seems
second-class. However, it’s a very top
second, and even top seconds are rare
in this field: on my calculations it’s
probably worth buying. Twenty shillings
buys perhaps three tickets to probably
boring films, and two readings of this
book will provide approximately as many
person-hours of better entertainment. The
smallest club would justify the publisher’s
extravagant belief in its durability, as
manifested by the positively glamorous
production.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Reserve Bank Watches Inflation, Wages
So the Reserve Bank now requires the Australian trading
banks to keep 14 p.c. of its customers’ deposits “on ice”!
The ratio of Statutory Reserve Deposits required to be
kept in the Reserve Bank’s freezing chamber has been raised
from 10.8 p.c. to 14 p.c. since the beginning of the year. The
latest increase, effective on February 5, brought the ratio from
12 p.c. to 14 p.c. and surprised more than a few people.
Yet Dr Coombs, Governor of the Reserve Bank, warned in
his previous announcements
early in January that further
calls to SRD would be made
over the next few months.
This suggests that the banks
had better brace themselves
for another call-up within a
short period. If another 2
p.c. is added in the next call-
up, the siphoning-off process
will be persistent and definite
and would raise the SRD
ratio to the highest level
since April/May, 1961.
Figures available to the
Reserve Bank undoubtedly
show that the return of cash
to the banks after the Christ-
mas spending, plus extremely
buoyant export receipts, are
underscoring the excess
capacity in the economy.
Getting rid of some of this
inflationary material is an
important function of the
Reserve Bank and certainly
more acceptable than rigid
and often damaging legis-
lative controls.
The Reserve Bank’s action,
however, should also be in-
terpreted by businessmen as
a good sign. It confirms
that the economy is moving
forward at a better rate, and
it would be unfortunate if a
sudden burst of spending in
A further graph illustrating the production of another
basic chemical, sulphuric acid, accompanies an article on the
Australian chemical industry beginning on page 51.
the wrong direction should give it too grqat a shove when wage
demands are coming up and the Commonwealth Government
itself yet has to implement many of its expansionist promises
of the last election.
So far, the improved liquidity has manifested itself more
noticeably in the automotive industry, where buoyant sales have
been reported. But there has been no evidence that the trading
banks are shovelling out large lumps of money on overdraft
arid causing chaos. On the contrary, the trading banks have
maintained a prudent internal policy, so that the larger-than-
expected call-up has not caused them any embarrassment.
Their liquidity ratios are still strong but continued call-ups
may remove some of the capacity to invest in the short-term
money market, Government securities, etc., and certainly will
clip a little bit of interest income from the banks.
At the same time, it should not be assumed that the trading
banks have been lending indiscriminately. In times of in-
flationary fears, speculation
in land and shares becomes a
paramount worry. But any-
one who has had dealings
with trading bank managers
in recent months knows that
it is extremely difficult to
prise money from the banks
for such purposes.
The Reserve Bank’s action,
therefore, is precautionary
and reflects more or less what
was expected in a year of
renewed expansion. Because
the call-up is larger than ex-
pected about £42m. —it
also shows that export re-
ceipts are better than expect-
ed and that import re-stock-
ing has not yet started to
make itself felt. Any pres-
sure by customers to draw on
those unused overdraft limits,
however, could give the
Adelaide and the ANZ a
headache, as their liquidity
ratios are getting closer to
the 18 p.c. minimum estab-
lished under a gentlemen’s
agreement with the Reserve
Bank.
Perhaps some of the banks
have already begun to change
their lending attitudes. A fall
in the rate of new and in-
creased lending commitments
(in the four weeks ended
January 8) suggests that possibility.
The Treasury also is taking full notice of the present
liquidity situation by confidently asking for £7O million in its
third loan of the 1963-64 year. A further oversubscription
appears probable, bringing the Government hard up against
the proposed loan target for this financial year. It might still
have to join Dr Coombs’ corrective process by soaking up
more cash in a fourth loan.


Investors Scurrying from
Socialist Rabbits
Australian investors can thank their lucky stars that the
stock markets here will be election free for perhaps the
next three years. It is quite different in Britain where, with
an election due in a few months, Mr Harold Wilson, the Labor
leader, has recently been pulling some of his Socialist rabbits
out of the hat and sending investors scurrying for cover.
However, what may be poison to Britain’s share markets
could prove to be meat for our own, and the London “Financial
Times”, which gave Australia’s economic performance in
1963 an Oscar, has been saying that a lot of money may be
frightened out of Throgmorton Street into the stock markets
here. If it is, we could have a real Stock Exchange boom,
because the one element lacking in the rise this last seven
months has been a flood of overseas money into Australian
shares.
Be that as it may, the “Investors’ Chronicle”, which notes
that share prices in the UK dropped 6 p.c. in January (after
a very good rise in 1963) and fell about 2 p.c. in the week
after Mr Wilson's Swansea (Wales) speech, has not given up
the cause of Britain’s equity shares as lost.
It says that “Mr Wilson's plans are clearly bad for share
prices, but all the broad outlines of his fiscal ideas have been
well enough known in the market for months and are by now
presumably discounted in share prices. . . . And if Labor comes
in it will still be possible to make money in the market —as it
was when Labor was in before.”
Excepting, perhaps, the proposals to impose an effective
capital gains tax (the present one introduced by Mr Selwyn
Lloyd three years ago is considered too watery by the British
Labor Party) and to reintroduce physical controls on building,
perhaps the second most important step suggested by Mr
Wilson is to use differential taxes to encourage one industry
and to curb another.
Here is a new danger, says the “Investors’ Chronicle” — the
creation of “a new lobby of pro - automation, pro - export-
industrialists trying to climb on to the Government subsidy
band waggon—and it is to be built up by a Labor Party that
has denounced overseas trade corporations as export subsidies
and contrary to GATT.
“You cannot fail to see one other major fault in it,” the
journal states. “The risk that the Government’s choice of a
company worthy of support may be wrong. The profit motive
stands as a yardstick for success or failure in business. Abolish
it, and what can you set up instead? Allow the Government —
the planning authority — to subsidise one lot of businesses
with money provided, of course, by the community at large —•
then by what yardstick will your success as a planner be
measured?”
Stamp, Stamp, Stamp along
the Highway
A mpol Petroleum’s directors made a fairly sedate reference
to the success of their give-away stamps promotional
scheme in the 1963 report: “We arranged for millions of
stamps to be available to collectors — young and old — from
Ampol stations. This campaign, still in full swing, has proved
one of the greatest we have ever promoted.”
Then, at the annual meeting, the chairman, Mr L. J.
Thompson, went so far as to ascribe the current rising rate
of petrol sales to a marketing project bound up with philately.
These sound like understatements if the envy of other
petroleum distributors and the relative failure of many earlier
sales devices are any criterion. Even the effects outside the
oil industry are large enough.
Seven Seas Stamps Pty Ltd of Dubbo (NSW), claiming to
be the biggest philatelic organisation in the Southern Hemi-
sphere, handles all Ampol’s stamp packaging. Its 45 full-time
and 80 part-time employees are struggling to keep up with
“production targets”, since a collecting boom has spread to
major chain-store and warehouse customers.
International stamp wholesalers also find a dramatically
magnified Australian market as Ampol lifts its buying
campaign.
The idea came from managing director W. M. Leonard’s
nine-year-old son: “Dad, why don’t you give away stamps?”
(Roger Randerson examines Ampol’s latest accounts on
pages 57-58.)
Asia is now
Tres Chic
France, forsaking its role as a colonial power after the Alger-
ian fracas, is attempting to stimulate trade with Asia and
Africa as a sort of poor man’s Uncle Sam . . . independent,
impartial, and chums with Red China.
The Jeanneney Commission has come up with an outline for
foreign aid to developing countries and, by this means, France
hopes to obtain links with countries which hesitate to choose
between East and West. By snapping his fingers at the US
Administration and displaying an independent line in recognis-
ing Red China, General de Gaulle evidently hopes to make
trading partners out of those hesitant nations which at the
moment want neither ardent Americanism nor rabid Com-
munism.
There are at least half a dozen African countries not already
linked with EEC which would welcome an independent foreign
aid partner. By specifying that it will not interfere with internal
politics, by offering to train experts and to provide technical
assistance on agricultural and engineering projects, France is
advised in the Jeanneney report to spread its interests outside
its former colonial empire and also to channel funds into
European institutions which would help to give it a bigger say
in international bodies.
European observers say that France’s hard-headedness over
the cost of developing such overseas trade (and it certainly
would prove expensive), plus the need to reform French ad-
ministrators away from colonialism, could make it a touchy
political issue. But already it is evident that France has embar-
ked on a policy of new-look economic expansion in Asia.
France, however, is generous with her bonhomie. The
French Minister for Finance, M. d’Estaing, visited Russia
recently with the object of expanding exports (fertiliser plants,
paper mills, synthetic textile factories, Renault cars, sugar
refineries and ships in exchange for anthracite, oil and caviar).
France also sent a trade mission to Peking last year and in
January announced its recognition of Red China. At the time
of writing it is being canvassed that France’s action could
provide an acceptable solution for the US by paving the way
for acceptance of two Chinas. Considering that Red China
originally supported the Algerian rebels, France’s latest move
is certainly a back-flip.
After the squabble between Russia and China, France offered
to supply Red China with capital goods, doubtless with an eye
also to re-establishing links with Indo-China, a former French
colony. France also took over from the Americans in supplying
aid to Cambodia. General de Gaulle, always alert to the pros-
pects of promoting France as a new leader in Asia, tingled
a few ear-drums last year by suggesting a reunion between
independent and neutral Vietnam. He does not permit the
world to forget his plans for the Grand Design.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
The PM’s Annual Economic Pow-wow
Basic wage case and the fear of inflation
a year of solid economic achieve-
ment and an overwhelming vote of
electoral confidence behind them, Federal
Ministers will face leaders of industry
and commerce at the now annual Can-
berra consultation in a much better
frame of mind next week than a year
ago when the economy was moving
ahead too slowly for most people's
liking.
This time probably the only dis-
satisfied representatives will be from the
trade unions who absented themselves
from the line-up last year, though even
they have few grounds for complaint
against the background of the increase
in margins and the lift in employment
in the last 12 months. It is a moot point
whether, in view of the gap between their
demands and the employers’ offer in the
coming basic wage case, and the eclipse
in Labor’s political fortunes, they will
make the trip this year either, important
though it be that their voice should be
heard.
Neither the representatives of the
manufacturers nor of primary industry,
both of whom have seen a big jump
in net income over the past year
and especially the latter who have been
blessed also by a budget which singled
them out for special favors —would seem
to have much to seek from the Govern-
ment, the more so because the Govern-
ment has not only succeeded in getting
the lift in economic activity they wanted
but has achieved this with only a
fractional lift in the internal price level
and to the tune of a massive rise in
overseas reserves.
Indeed, so many economic imponder-
ables have been removed during the last
year, even to stickiness in private invest-
ment, an abrupt improvement in the
terms of trade, a general reduction in
interest rates throughout the economy,
and a break-through on the housing
front, that the danger at this year’s con-
sultation could be a satisfied complacency
on all sides about the economic position.
Tt would be difficult for anybody to
sustain a case that the Government’s
economic policies over the last year or
so haven’t magnificently succeeded
however much the results may be due to
factors outside its control, such as the
continued stubbornness of consumption
spending in the face of a substantial rise
in income generation from all sources.
Nevertheless, it is also true that when
everything is going exceptionally well
for the economy it is time to be extra
wary in economic policy, lest the lights
get too bright a green.
This isn’t to say the Government
shouldn’t redress any genuine grievances
put up to it from any of the representa-
tives at the consultation, but rather
remind them that they have seldom had
it so good and point to the additional
demands that threaten to be made on
resources in the coming year.
Certainly the most imminent of these
threats lies in the possible result of the
basic wage case, the hearing of which is
set for later in the month. There is little
the Government can do about that be-
cause, although it could make representa-
tions to the Arbitration Commission
that it would be a pity to wreck the nice
balance and, indeed, the buoyancy of
the economy by giving a big increase in
the basic wage, this sort of argument
might sound rather theoretical to Com-
missioners under persuasion from Mr
Hawke on the obvious state of prosperity
and the scope for giving employees their
fair share of it.
"LTowever, while it cannot be taken for
granted by any means, the emplo-
yers would seem to stand a fair chance
of obtaining the advantage in the com-
promise which obviously must be
reached between their own offer of Bs.
a week addition to the basic wage and
the trade unions’ demand of £2 12s. a
week. For this time the employers have
thrown down the gauntlet to the Com-
mission in asking for a wholesale re-
consideration of the determination of
wages, and have marshalled what in
most respects looks like an impelling
case.
Probably the least said before the
Commission by the Government the
better, though from recent soundings in
Canberra one gathers that the country's
economic policy-makers are very worried
that the Commission will throw a span-
ner into their nicely balanced works.
As seen there, the fly in the ointment
is the one that has been haunting the
policy-makers for some time past—that
is, the possibility of a sharp increase in
the propensity to spend. While some
regard the danger to stability not so far
from the surface of the continually
mounting liquidity in the system, it is
understood that the authorities are fairly
confident they can handle that situation
witness last week’s call-up of £42
million into the SRD. But they are not
so confident that they can keep the lid
on the pent-up spending power latent
in savings deposits, which statistics issued
last week show increased by £259.9
million in the calendar year 1963. (In
the previous year when cautionary saving
motives, one would have thought, were
much more justified than in 1963, savings
bank deposits increased by £195.3 mil-
lion or £64.6 million less than last year.)
HThe argument runs that sooner or
later the attraction of saving as
against spending is bound to weaken, and,
indeed, it was expected to do so follow-
ing the reduction in savings banks deposit
rates last year but strangely did not. It
becomes more and more apparent that
while cautionary saving motives may
well be much less strong now than they
were a year ago, people are still very
much attracted to putting their money
in savings banks while the price level
remains stable.
But what if prices started to rise? If
stability gave way to inflation, perhaps
under the pressure of a big lift in the
basic wage? There are plenty of
precedents to tell us that savings would
lose their glamor, that the propensity
to spend would rise and that it would
rise the faster according to the degree
of inflation.
Does anybody want these ugly pro-
cesses to start? Least of all the Govern-
ment, if only for the reason that they
would undermine its present hold on the
capital market and create difficulties for
the financing of public works throughout
the Commonwealth.
To take but one facet of this operation
last year—out of depositors’ balances, the
savings banks provided £l4l i million
for public works finance in Australia.
Or, consider the effect on the pro-
vision of housing finance which stands
high on the list of Government objec-
tives. The savings banks have come par-
ticularly to the fore in this field in recent
years, especially since the last Budget
which gave them the power to invest up
to 35 p.c. of their depositors’ balances
in bousing loans.
That they are using this power is
evidenced by the December savings
banks figures showing that out of the
total addition of to their
assets within Australia, £11,827,000, or
more than half, went into housing loans.


Chemicals Pass the Acid Test
A bright future , given enough protection
The Australian chemical in-
dustry generally is faring very
well. In industrial chemicals, such
as the acids, chlorine and caustic
soda, production and sales are
well above last year’s figures.
There is increasing interest in
petrochemicals, but figures for this
time of year are down, mainly
because of reduced demand in
certain durable goods.
Falling production of refri-
gerators is a good indicator of this.
But the industry is confident of
a prosperous and expanding future,
despite the fact that imports of
chemicals are running at a high
level and could reach a record in
the 1963-64 financial year. A call
for more protective tariffs comes
from all sections of the industry.
Australian industrial chemical
manufacturers aie at present pro-
ducing at record or near-record
levels and expect even greater increases
in the forthcoming 12 months.
Of four basic chemicals, all but one
recorded dramatic production rises in the
four months to October, foreshadowing
a comfortable year for the industry.
Nitric acid was the only one to show
a drop, production easing to 6741 tons
compared with 7337 tons for the cor-
responding period in 1962. Sulphuric
acid, used widely in the production of
fertilisers, rose dramatically from 391.5
thousand tons for the four months to
October in 1962 to 422.3 thousand tons
for the comparable period last year.
Other rises were recorded by hydro-
chloric acid, up from 1521 tons to 1554
tons, and chlorine (used in newsprint
and textile manufacture as a bleaching
agent) up from 12,086 to 13,016 tons.
And most manufacturers expect this
trend to continue.
Imports, too, are growing. The follow-
ing table gives imports of chemicals,
drugs and fertilisers for the five months
to November.
CHEMICAL IMPORTS
1962 1963
July £5,127,000 £5,958,000
August 6,419,000 6,878,000
September 6,141,000 6,109,000

November 5,742,000 6,657,000
£29,769,000 £32,697,000
Total imports of chemicals drugs, and
fertilisers for the first five months of
1963-64 stand at £32,697,000,
compared with the previous
corresponding period’s total of
£29,769,000. Imports for
the year 1962-63 totalled
£69,519,053, compared with
1961-62’s figure of £58,155,996.
Based on the percentage in-
crease between the two years,
1963-64’s imports of chemicals,
drugs and fertilisers could reach
£82,280,077.
Managing director of CSR
Chemicals, Mr E. L. Ifould.
said his company’s sales and
production at present were
higher than figures recorded
for the previous corresponding
period.
Less than 10 p.c. of CSR
Chemicals’ production was for
export. “We export six or eight chemi-
cals all around the world but our biggest
market is New Zealand,” he said. “We
are expanding our exports by personal
visits overseas, using the Federal Govern-
ment's exports incentive scheme to help
pay for the trips. We have just had two
men in the East and another in New
Zealand.”
Mr Ifould said the principal pressure
from imports on Australian-produced
chemicals was pressure on prices and
profits. “One meets import competition
by reducing prices until the competition
is shut off,” he said. “But we can't live
with imports . . . we must have the
whole market. The pressure on chemicals
we can produce here is on prices, not
on volume. A large proportion of imports
are not made here. From a technical
point of view they can be made here
but economically they cannot.”
There is over-capacity in the industry
but, according to most manufacturers,
it is only to allow for future expansion
of demand.
is for 3000 tons, the manufacturer who
builds new plant will have to allow for
other 1000 tons. So he increases his capa-
city to meet the demand in a few years’
an increase in 18 months’ time of an-
time of, say, 6000 tons. Call it reserve
capacity rather than over-capacity.
“There is also over-supply in the in-
dustry. A number of chemicals made by
some of the smaller firms use other
chemicals as their raw materials. The
plant they use is relatively small and it
is relatively easy to get into this sector
of the industry.”
Mr Ifould envisages a bright future
for the chemical industry. Synthetics,
of which chemicals are a basic require-
ment, are becoming more and more
widely used.
“With the proper encouragement and
protection the chemical industry must
grow in Australia,” he said. “It is so im-
portant that it must be given the proper
Mr Ifould said: “If the market today
augurs well for the future. We have a
environment and so the growth rate
will increase. The industry is in a
process of digestion at the moment after
expansion between 1959-1962 and there
two or three years.
“What is good for Australia just can’t
help being good for the chemical
industry. The general buoyancy of the
Australian economy at the moment
will be further expansion in the next
boom period at the moment
without any of the evils usually
associated with it.
“The industry has now com-
pletely recovered from the ef-
fects of the credit squeeze, but
we still have pressure on us
from world chemical prices.
Take, for instance, an overseas
manufacturer who sells his
chemicals for £X even though it
has cost him £X-plus to make
them. In this way he gains an
export outlet ... we cannot pos-
sibly hope to compete with this
because they don't really care if
they sell it under cost since they
make it up in other ways.”
On the petrochemicals side of
the industry, Mr H. F. Holmes,
general manager of Australian
Petrochemicals Ltd, said there had not
been a rise in his company's sales and
production. “Competition from imports
and reduced demand from local con-
sumers in the durable goods section has
caused this. Refrigerator production last

OFFICES THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA
year was down, and refrigerators are one
of the final-end users of our products.
(Production of refrigerators, in which
several pounds of plastics are used, has
dropped steadily from the 1960-61 out-
put of 219.5 thousand, to 211.9 thou-
sand in 1961-62, and 204.8 thousand in
1962-63. This is due in part to the
November, 1960, credit restrictions
which curtailed both home building and
furnishing.)
“Since our products are used as raw
materials to make plastics, our chief
import competition comes from finished
plastics. The import of plastic products
was a serious problem last year. Some-
thing like 10 p.c. of the local market
has been taken by imports and a figure
of this order is a quite significant one.
“We have no direct competition as
far as raw materials are concerned,
because we can compete on a price basis
but it is the finished product that affects
us —we could get 100 p.c. of the market
given sufficient tariff protection.
“Price trends are downwards while
production trends are upwards. Up till
now the chemical industry in Australia
has been relatively small, but now it is
starting to expand. The industry can’t
help but expand, but there is tremendous
international competition. Australia
suffers from having a small population
and market ... it is not going to be
an easy road to meet international
competition and compete for markets.”
TI/|r Holmes agreed with most other
manufacturers on the question of
over-capacity. There is a certain amount
of it in most sections, but it must be so
to allow for the future.
On staff problems Mr Holmes said:
“There is not a critical shortage, but
Australia relies a great deal on over-
seas know-how and skills to improve its
industry. The level of education in Aus-
tralian universities is not sophisticated
enough to keep pace with new develop-
ments. There is a lack of broad support
in higher technical areas, and technical
people in Australia have been at a
premium for the last decade.”
Mr Holmes said his company had
recovered fully from the effects of the
credit squeeze “although consumer dur-
ables, our biggest single outlet for our
products, had a bad time last year. It
was due mainly to the reduced level of
construction and the lack of money”.
Both production and sales of Aus-
tralian Chemical Holdings Ltd are up
10 p.c., says managing director Mr
A. C. Hatrick. But the industry could
face hardships if the Tariff Board’s
emergency tariff on imports is not con-
firmed. “Generally, the chemicals manu-
factured by our group have tariff pro-
tection which has helped to minimise
imports,” he said. “We have had some
competition from imports, on chemical
colors and plasticisers and in both cases
we currently have additional tariff pro-
tection through emergency duty.
“However, certain basic raw materials,
because of the size of the Australian
market, will continue to be imported.
In the case where goods are already
manufactured in Australia, sufficient
tariff should give manufacturers 100 p.c.
of the available business. Additionally
many products currently being imported
could be manufactured locally, given
sufficient tariff protection.”
The industry faced a problem of over-
capacity rather than oversupply, Mr
Hatrick said. If the available plant
capacity throughout the chemical in-
dustry was utilised to its full extent
there would be considerable oversupply,
but manufacturers generally were re-
stricting their production to cover the
current markets available to them.
Mr Hatrick said there was no short-
age of trained technical stafi in the
industry “as the major chemical com-
panies have schemes to encourage and
assist tertiary education of their trainee-
technical and administrative personnel”.
But still the industry s biggest threat
is cheap imports. The Government dealt
the local industry a severe blow in 1960
when import restrictions were lifted and
it is only now that there is any sub-
stantial evidence of recovery. The in-
dustry is awaiting a decision from the
Tariff Board on whether it will confirm
the emergency tariff recently applied
to some chemicals or whether the rate
will be changed as a result of a hearing.
Petrochemicals also could begin to
show an improvement this vear. Last
year interest in this branch expanded,
but was insufficient to give the increase
other sections of the chemical industry
experienced. Its chief problem is imports
of finished plastics, not of the raw
materials.
A recently-released Tariff Board re-
port on weedicides and pesticides in-
dicates the Board is keen to hold an
inquiry into the production of chlorine,
caustic soda and other chemicals de-
rived from salt. The Board is concerned
about the high cost of the local product
compared with the overseas product.
The report said: “Caustic soda and
soda ash are used in the production of
a wide range of goods including
chemicals, textiles, paper, petroleum
refining and processing of metals. They
are highly important materials which
lie at the base of the cost structure in
the production of many commodities.
“The substantial disparity between
Australian and overseas prices is a heavy
burden on the user industries which
are required to compete with imports
from countries where prices are much
lower. The Board, on several occasions,
has expressed concern about the high
cost of some basic organic and inorganic
chemicals to user industries and the
resultant high prices of °nd products.
“In its 1962 report on certain products
made from chlorine, the Board again
drew attention to the high cos f of these
chemicals and suggested that it be given
an opportunity of examining within two
years the assistance, if any, required in
the production of salt and its derivatives,
chlorine and caustic soda.
“According to Union Carbide, salt
makes up about one-fifth of the cost
of production of chlorine and caustic
soda. The cost of the salt into the
company’s works at Rhodes was from
two to six times the cost that would be
incurred by large producers in the USA,”
the Board said.
The cost of shipping the salt from
South Australia into the factory at
Rhodes was 61 p.c. of the into-plant
cost.
When, and if, the inquiry is held the
Board could widen its terms of reference
and include other basic chemicals, some
of which, according to manufacturers,
could use stronger protection.

INVESTMENT SECTION
High Liquidity Favored
High Finance
Reserve Bank’s call-up will help
HThe results and sentiments displayed
by our bank - backed consumer
finance and hire-purchase companies in
their reports on operations for the first
half of 1963-64 reflected the high level
of competition which exists in this field,
even now that economic conditions have
returned to buoyant levels.
The combination of almost full em-
ployment and the high liquidity level
created big lifts in the demand from
consumers for finance on new cars,
homes, household appliances, etc., and
the financiers vied strongly for a share
of the wider market during the half-
year.
Unlike many industries, where demand
increases take some time to meet and
often involve heavy costs in extending
productive capacity, the liquidity level
enabled the bank-backed financiers to
fill their debenture issues readily and at
gradually reducing rates of interest. In
fact, most of their issues were heavily
oversubscribed so they met demands on
their funds quite easily.
The only real effect of the lower
interest rates was to reduce the income
to the debenture holders. The interest
payments borne by the companies fell
only slightly and ten years would have
to elapse before any significant benefit
arose. In other words, the financiers
can get virtually nothing from a smaller
interest charge because over time the
rates climb again to higher levels.
So to increase profits they must com-
pete for more business. This, in turn,
usually means more bad debts the
main headache which the directors of
money-lending companies must try to
eliminate. As well as competition
between themselves, they have been up
against high bank liquidity.
Bad debt levels are apparently being
kept well under control as the recent
batch of interim reports made few
references at all to the problem. In the
case of Custom Credit, this was rather
regrettable because the 1962-63 result,
the lowest fox five years, was mainly
affected by “abnormal” bad debts and an
underwriting loss. Shareholders were
told that earning rate had risen from
15.8 to 17.7 p.c. during the six months,
but were not told if bad debts were back
to “normal”, or if the underwriting loss
was continuing just that subsidiary
profits and business written were
generally improving.
The National Bank holds 40 p.c. of
Custom’s capital —we hope it knows
how the bad debt situation is. Various
banks hold a 40 p.c. interest in the other
big consumer financiers with the excep-
tion of Industrial Acceptance (the
biggest in the field) which is only 14 p.c.
owned by the ANZ Bank. Australian
Guarantee is backed by the Bank of
NSW, CAGA by the Commercial Bank
of Sydney, Finance Corporation by the
Bank of Adelaide, General Credits by
the Commercial Bank of Australia and
Associated Securities by the Royal Bank
of Scotland.
The security provided by the presence
of the banks makes it relatively easy for
the companies concerned to raise money
whenever they need it.
The best report came from Australian
Guarantee whose profit ran at a record
rate to December 31. From earnings of
£968,781 a 7i p.c. interim dividend will
be paid, indicating a 15 p.c. payout for
the 11 th year in succession. Result for
the 1962-63 year was a record
£1,860,051.
The interim statements from Associ-
ated Securities, CAGA, General Credits,
Industrial Acceptance and Finance Cor-
poration all suggested steady improve-
ments.
Unlike the others, Industrial Accept-
ance balances on December 31 so its
interim report to last June did not fully
reflect the more buoyant conditions of
the latter half of 1963, although it re-
ferred to a slight profit increase. When
the preliminary profit figures are released
at the end of the month it is quite prob-
able that the “slight” increase will have
changed to a more “substantial” one.
General Credits is in the same boat
to a lesser degree because it balances
at March 31. In the report for the six
months to October 31, directors spoke
of “continued recovery”, further diversi-
fication into country areas, and an up-
ward trend in insurance results.
This company is regarded by brokers
as a “recovery” stock. In 1962-63 profit
jumped by £72,917 to £240,286 equalling
7 p.c. on capital. A 6j p.c. payout was
made after nil in the previous year and
5-5/6 p.c. in 1960-61.
The company appears to be combat-
ing competition effectively through its
expansion in country areas, and the
management wisely made a £150,000
provision from unappropriated profits
last year to meet any excessive bad debts.
Regarding this position and the fact
that, at 7s. the shares are closer to
par than any of the other financiers’, the
scrip looks a promising buy, especially
with a yield close to 5 p.c.
An investment in any of these com-
panies would be worthwhile because of
their current prosperity which will be
enhanced now that the trading banks’
liquid funds have been further thinned
through another “freezing” by the
Reserve Bank.
Secret Preserves
/Companies with scant respect for the
rights of shareholders can still deny
them information, notwithstanding
tighter company legislation. It is all a
matter of willingness.
The Registrar of Companies in
Victoria apparently spelt out to Henry
Jones Co-operative Ltd that £stgl, two
Rands and £INZ are not the equivalent
of £AI.
So in 1962-63 for the first time,
Henry Jones converted its assets and
earnings of overseas subsidiaries at rates
of exchange ruling on balance dates.
As a result £250,000 was transferred to
a provision for exchange fluctuation.
Now another problem rears its ugly
head for shareholders wading through
a sticky mess, seeking the true worth
of their investment.

stocks are carried in the balance sheet
at lower than current cost.
Stocks are always the key item in
any audit, and if these cannot be verified

Anyway the group reported a small
fall in pre-tax profit, but another increase
in post-tax profit, up from £878,700 to
£907,900. The tax provision of £304,000
was much reduced from the 1961-62
figure of £469,400. Depreciation rose
from £327,000 to £337,300. (All com-
parative figures for 1961-62 have been
adjusted by the company, overseas
curriencies being converted on a realistic
rate of exchange.
The company used to supply useful
information through the publication of
separate profit and loss accounts for
Australian and overseas subsidiaries. Its
omission this year is a retrograde step,
but it is not too late for the chairman
to make amends at the annual meeting.
Choice or Chance?
YMhether it was perfect judgment or
merely chance that prompted A. V.
Wehl’s directors to move into the public
limelight last September is something we
will probably never know. But whatever
it was, the change was perfectly timed
to use the new capital to maximum
advantage in the currently booming
home-building industry.
Sporting an earning rate of 20.8 p.c.
in 1962-63 and predicting a 10 p.c.
dividend for 1963-64, this Melbourne-
based distributor of laminated plastics,
flakeboard and associated products came
on the market at a substantial premium.
The manufacture and distribution of the
“Lami-form” bathroom vanity unit is
the other major activity.
The market premium made share-
holders rather proud of their investment
choice and chests swelled even further
when a quarterly report was issued with
full details of sales (up 32 p.c.), profit
(up 45 p.c.), tax, depreciation and earn-
ing rate (23.9 p.c.). The commendable
attitude to shareholders was repeated
last week when similar items were re-
leased for the half-year to December 31.
These announced an earning rate of
30.2 p.c. on capital increased from
£134,000 to £lBO,OOO by the acquisition
in December of Sydney-based Plycraft
Pty Ltd, a profit of £27,517, and most
important, an interim payout of 6i p.c.
indicating 12i p.c. for the full year.
The issuing of a quarterly report and
the detailed nature of the interim report
shows a high degree of responsibility to
shareholders. But we must ask would
the board have been so informative if
results had not been so rosy?
Food for Thought
HThe “substantially higher” sales enjoyed
A by General Goods Corporation in
the December half-year must be largely
due to the rusults of Montague Bernard
and Co., Melbourne confectionery manu-
facturer, which the Corporation acquired
last June.
The acquisition was expected to create
savings in the manufacturing and distri-
bution activities of the whole group and
improve its competitive position in the
rapidly changing food industry. It has
done just this so far.
The extent of the savings was not
revealed although the directors said that
the six-month profit was “higher”.
Whether last year’s earning rate was
maintained on the paid capital increased
from £200.000 to £220,000 by the take-
over is food for thought for share-
holders.
But the group’s competitive position
has obviously improved, because the
sales increase was attributable to additions
to the range of products. These additions
were not solely attributed to the Monta-
gue buy because the rest of the group has
marketed some new lines itself.
Maltster’s Hopes Fade
Judging by the interim report, it looks
** as though Smith Mitchell’s expected
increase in malt sales to Japan has not
come about. In the 1962-63 annual re-
port directors were hoping to lift these
exports because of a bad barley harvest
during the year in Japan.
The Melbourne maltster made no
mention of export sales in the interim
statement, but merely announced that
overall sales and profits were satisfactory
and comparable with the first half of
1962-63.
In that year profit eased from the
record £105,943 to £100,622 although
record sales were chalked up. Higher
production costs and lower margins from
the export trade in the second half re-
duced the trading profit.
So unless exports pick up or the com-
pany can reduce costs, it will be very
hard to top the 1961-62 record result
this year. This is, really not very worry-
ing, however, because last year’s 11 p.c.
dividend was well covered by a 23.1
p.c. earning rate.

Lend Lease to Lease More
T end Lease Corporation’s announce-
ment that it favored retention of
appropriate properties developed by the
company, with emphasis on a greater
continuing head lease profit in prefer-
ence to a single development profit, will
tend to smooth out fluctuations in profits
which a developer and constructor
usually experiences.
In reporting the profit for the
December six months, directors said it
contained no significant profits from
development projects. Project profits
were budgeted for the second half of
the year.
This somewhat relieves the impact of
the news that after providing £108,725
less for tax at £109,362, but £30,939
more for depreciation at £122,835, the
net profit for the half-year fell £26,725

than the 5 p.c. dividend requirement.

only 10.7 p.c. compared with 15.2 p.c.
for the previous corresponding period.
The market reacted badly to this
announcement and straight away dropped
the ss. shares lid. to 9s. 3d. They
should still be approached with caution.
Woodniason’s Issue?
T ast week’s increased dividend an-
nouncement from Woodmason’s
Ltd indicates that 1963-64 could be a
record year for the company and,
coupled with the fact that authorised
capital was doubled to £500,000 last
October, it could possibly be assumed
the shareholders will see a share issue
within the next few months.
Admittedly the capital increase was
necessary by virtue of the fact that paid
capital was £245,000 only £5OOO
short of the authorised figure and
directors stated at the time that no new
issue was intended in the “immediate
future”. But if the 1963-64 result of
this Melbourne-based cold storage and
quick-freezing group proves to be as
successful as the previous two years,
which it apparently will, then capital
benefits could be announced with the
profit results next September, a time
which could hardly have been regarded
last October as the “immediate future”.
EMI on Top of Costs
TTigher profits from lower sales indicate
that EMI (Aust.) Ltd has held costs
down in the six months to December.
A yield of 2.9 p.c. is available from
the shares recently priced at 245. 9d.,
which was about the mid-price of last
year’s high and low.
Leather to Cutlery
T eather tanner, J. Bayley and Sons
Ltd, will sell imported household
hardware and cutlery.
This is as a result of a takeover of
Caminer (Hardware) Pty Ltd. Consi-
deration was the issue of 52,000 ss. Bay-
ley shares currently worth approximately
£31,200.
The takeover represents Bayley’s first
departure from the hides and skins
business.


Ampol Has a Big Job to Face
New refinery’s bearing on future dividend rate
By ROGER RANDERSON
Such are the immense achievements
of Ampol Petroleum Limited in
the short space of 28 years and
the untold value to the nation of the
company’s projects directed towards
creating a fully-integrated oil industry,
owned and operated by Australians, that
a broad perspective is needed in analysing
its recent accounts and the investment
status of its securities.
The public’s imagination has been
fired by the ambitious plan to spend
£2l million on a wholly-owned refinery
at Fort Lytton on the mouth of the
Brisbane River, hard by the terminus
of the oil pipe-line from Moonie.
At the moment only limited informa-
tion is available on which to guess at
future returns from the Lytton refinery,
although commitments arising from it
can be seen more clearly.
Investors taking the short view will
attach special importance to the state-
ment by Ampol Petroleum’s chairman
at last month’s annual meeting that
“sales and profits for the first quarter
of the current year have shown an
increase at a rate greater than projected
and in excess of the average rate of
growth over the last two years.”
Such an assurance was timely, because
it is quite clear from accounts for the
year ended September 30, 1963, that
the company has been having quite a
struggle to maintain the 14 p.c. dividend
on ordinary shares, which has been paid
in each of the past four years.
Prices which investors are prepared
to pay for the company’s convertible
notes and for its dividend-deferred
ordinary shares must obviously be re-
lated to expected prices for the ordinary
shares, which in turn depend on the
expected ordinary dividend rate.
Mr Thompson’s statement at the
annual meeting reinforced what had
previously appeared in the printed report
by directors to shareholders.
The directors had stated their belief
that, “subject to unforeseen circum-
stances, the 1963 year will, as pre-
viously forecast, prove to be the low
point in our earning rate on capital.
“Commencing in 1964, and increasing
in velocity in subsequent years, invest-
ment in projects previously non-revenue
producing will begin to reflect in our
profits and return on capital”, they
added.
Ampol Petroleum last year had to re-
duce its stated reserves by £123,077
after meeting dividend payments of
£2,317,544 and that, too, after
capitalising items aggregating £651,474
as “Intangibles”, which included ex-
penditure on oil search and exploration
and on share and note issues.
Earning rate on ordinary capital had
steadily declined from about 22.6 p.c.
in the 1956-57 year, when the company
paid an ordinary dividend of 12i p.c.
and made its last bonus issue (one-for-
five).
Since then earnings per share have
been “diluted” by annual issues of shares,
convertible notes, deferred shares and
dividend-deferred shares, together with
a placement and issues to acquire Yellow
Cabs Holdings Ltd and real estate.
Ampol brand service stations, owned
or sponsored, have multiplied until the
chain now numbers close to 1900, and
the number of gallons of petroleum
products sold has shown the remarkable
increase of 82 p.c. since 1956-57.
The company has even gained on its
competitors by increasing its share of
the market from about 6i to 8 p.c. in
the period.
However, Ampol’s turnover and other
revenue, despite these impressive selling
results, increased by the lesser percentage
of 50 p.c. between 1957 and 1963.
Whether it be the result of price
control initiated in Queensland and
South Australia or of the natural forces
of competition, or a bit of both, this
comparison raises the hypothesis that
Ampol has been operating on gross
profit margins that are rather low.
Governments, which should encourage
Ampol for what it is doing to reduce
national expenditures of foreign
exchange, could take steps to relieve this
position. Nor should they hesitate to
tell consumers how much cheaper petrol
is here than in other parts of the world.
It is true that Ampol’s fully-stated
net profit has risen from £1,436,519 in
1956-57 to £2,606,679 in 1962-63—an
increase of 81 p.c.
But this can only be properly related,
from the shareholders’ standpoint, to the
increase in capital. Paid-up capital
(including convertible notes) at the
balancing date last September aggregated
£26,299,845, and the 3s. call on the
dividend-deferred shares at the end
of March will increase the total to
£30,380,184.
Compared with £8,128,284 in 1957,
Ampol’s paid-up capital will soon have
increased by 274 p.c.
The important comparison, then, is
between an 81 p.c. increase in stated net
profit with an increase of 274 p.c. in
capital.
Three major investments since 1957
have been in the 33,150 tons tanker
P. J. Adams, the B. F. Goodrich tyre fac-
tory (41.79 p.c. interest) and Australian
Lubricating Oil Refinery at Kurnell (25
p.c. interest).
It is estimated that in 1963 no less
than £5,795,000 of funds invested in
these projects were non-revenue pro-
ducing, while in the current year
revenue will begin to flow in from all
but £BBO,OOO of these funds.
However, with the addition of the
Fort Lytton refinery project, which is
not expected to come “on stream” until
the middle of next year, the company’s
non-revenue producing funds have
actually increased, and the low return
from much greater other funds is no
less important.
What is Ampol Petroleum’s true
earning rate? Obviously it is below the
14 p.c. dividend which is being paid to
ordinary shareholders.
I give the result of three calculations.
The earning rate is 12 p.c. if stated
profit less preference charge is related
to paid-up capital (excluding preference
capital) of more than £2l million, as
shown in the last balance sheet.
It is 11 p.c. if interest on convertible
notes is added back, and the sum is re-
lated to the balance sheet total of paid-
up capital and convertible notes.
And it will be 9.3 p.c. if similarly re-
Correction
“The MLC Limited” is the
correct name of the listed public
company which Roger Randerson
reviewed last week. It is import-
ant that ‘‘The MLC Limited”, as
the holding company, should
always be distinguished from ‘‘The
Mutual Life and Citizens’ Assur-
ance Company Limited”, which is
its Life Office subsidiary. The
funds of the Life Office are kept
quite distinct from those of the
public company, and the public
has no share participation in it.
This corrects the error in the
first paragraph of Mr Randerson’s
article, which occurred through an
inadvertent alteration of his copy.


lated to paid-up capital and convutiole
notes when they total more than £3O
million after March 31.
Maintenance of the 14 p.c. dividend
on ordinary shares is thus clearly depen-
dent on the frugality of £750,000 of
overseas capital content to receive 5 p.c.
dividends until 1966 and of £4,098,893
of local capital content with 6 p.c. in-
terest payments until 1967, together with
the abstinence of a further £7,808,232
securing no return until 1967.
All this capital, however, is hoping
to receive the 14 p.c. dividend from 1967
on.
If everyone is to be satisfied, Ampol
Petroleum within four years will need
to find for dividends no less than
£4,173,225 a year—an 80 p.c. increase
on dividend payments of £2,317,544
for 1962-63.
In other words, the company will
need to step its earning rate up from
about 9 to more than 14 p.c. within four
years. Obviously some surplus over divi-
dends is required for reserves.
I do not say this cannot be done,
although it does seem to be an almost
impossible task.
What bearing has the Lytton refinery
on profit and dividend prospects?
The refinery’s capital of about £7.7
million supplied from the dividend-
deferred issue will be supplemented by
£13.3 million of term loans supplied by
a consortium of banks and financial
institutions.
It is intended that £1 million of interest
incurred on these loans up to the middle
of next year, when production is due to
begin at the refinery, will be included
in the capital cost.
After that, the refinery will meet
annual interest charges of about £958,000
a year until repayments start in 1967-68,
and interest charges then begin to fall.
The refinery is expected, beginning
in 1967-68, to repay loans from the
banks by four annual instalments of
about £1,583,460, followed by a final
instalment of more than £2 million in
1971-72. After a brief lull, it will repay
loans from other institutions by four
annual instalments of £1,250,000 be-
tween 1974 and 1978.
If, as has been suggested, the Lytton
refinery will be able to contribute 14 p.c.
of the capital it uses towards meeting
Ampol's ordinary dividend plus a margin,
net profit of more than £3 million a
year must be contemplated by 1967-68,

Whether this is a reasonable expecta-
tion or not, I am in no position to
judge, but my feeling persists that future
dividends depend more on getting a
better return from transportation and
marketing.
Ampol still labors under the dis-
advantage, compared with many of its
competitors, of not being able to draw
resources from its own deposits of crude
petroleum. Instead of being fed from
riches in the ground, it has had to start
from the hard selling end.
For many years it has been part of
the Walkley strategy to seek out com-
mercial oilfields to remove this handi-
cap, and to complete the integration of
an independent local oil industry. Early
success at Rough Range in 1953 has
been followed by costly disappointment
and now the company’s 70 p.c. holding
of valuable shares in Ampol Exploration
leaves it virtually with a 10 p.c. interest
in any “WAPET” discoveries in Western
Australia.
Nothing daunted, however, the com-
pany is directly applying funds at present
in looking for oil in Queensland.
The market has good reason to want
a 6.3 p.c. dividend yield from the 5s.
ordinary share at about 11s. 2d., and I
could not suggest offering more for the
share at present.
Nevertheless, Ampol has an assured
place in our economic structure,
especially now that it has the backing
of leading banks and life offices, and
many of its financial arrangements seem
to be designed to prevent an extremely
valuable property going too cheaply in
a “take-over bid.”
Feltex Without S. Africa
and Textiles of Australia Ltd
earned £32,000 more in Australasia
in the six months to December 31, 1963,
than for the same period of 1962.
Its profit of £458,000 is after un-
stated tax and depreciation, and is equal
to 13.7 p.c. on capital.
In mid-November the 50 p.c. interest
in Felt and Textiles of South Africa was
sold for £2.4 million cash. This was to
be used to eliminate bank overdrafts and
finance development. The South African
company contributed an extra £161,000
to group profit in the six months to
December, 1962.
The high earnings of the South African
investment will be nigh impossible to
replace from other sources.
But the company has no difficulty in
repeating the usual annual dividend rate
of 10 p.c. The 5s. shares at about 9s.
to yield 5.6 p.c. should still interest
income-minded investors.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Good Time to Buy Email Shares
A Comparison with AW A
Tt is always hazardous for an outside
observer to make any predictions
regarding a company when he can be
proved wrong within a very short time.
Email’s financial year has just ended
and under normal conditions it would be
about another three months before even
the preliminary figures for the year’s
profits are available. However, with
current prices around 9s. Id. to show a
dividend yield of 5.5 p.c., covered just
over 1.3 times by the 1962 earnings, it
could well be that the present is a good
time to buy the shares which have risen
only 16 p.c. since January, 1963.
As pointed out in a previous article,
AWA shares have risen 44 p.c. (admit-
tedly following an increase in the divi-
dend rate), and we find the name of
Email frequently coupled with AWA, for
example in the sponsorship of United
Telecasters and earlier in Amalgamated
Television Services Pty Ltd.
Some years ago (in November, 1956)
the boards of AWA and Email decided
to examine the desirability of a merger,
but after 12 months they announced that
they had decided to defer further con-
sideration of proposals for a complete
pooling of interest and resources. Even
today, the two companies do not appear
to compete with one another throughout
the whole range of their now very di-
verse electrical products.
According to the booklet which Email
published in 1962, the eight divisions
(excluding the finance division) pro-
duced over 100 groups of products. Even
though many of these groups are closely
related, it is fairly clear that the range
is very wide. Unfortunately, we are un-
able to judge the relative importance of
each division, although from time to time
it has been suggested that the consumer
products division contributes fairly sub-
stantially to group revenue. It may well
be that the trends in this division may
give some clue to the profitability of the
group even though it probably represents
less than 50 p.c. of total revenue.
Tn October, the directors stated that
overall sales for the eight months to
August had been maintained and orders
on hand were substantially above 1962.
Competition was intense and satisfactory
margins were hard to maintain despite
improved operating costs.
Production statistics are available for
a number of items produced by Email
and they are given below for the eight
months covered by the interim report
and for the ten months to October (the
latest figures available) with comparison
with the 1962 position:—

Domestic Washing Machines 155 143 194 184
Room Air Conditioners 13 6 10 5
In two cases figures are available for
the 12 months to December.
Domestic refrigerators totalled approx-
imately 197,000 as against approxi-
mately 217,000 in 1962 but, in Decem-
ber, 1963, production was running more
than 10 p.c. higher than in December,
1962.
Washing machines totalled approxi-
mately 218,000 as against approximately
225,000 in 1962. In the case of this
particular appliance, production in the
last three months of the year was 8 p.c.
up on the corresponding period of 1962.
Looking at these figures and referring
back to the interim report, one must
assume that either Email produces
greater proportions of ranges and hot
water services, or that its many other
products showed increases in sales to off-
set the overall drop in the items listed
above. It is more likely to be the latter.
npwo announcements in December, first
A that the company had entered the
field of industrial dust and pollution con-
trol in association with Standard Filter-
bau of West Germany, and, secondly,
that a contract for the supply of power
transformers to the Munmorah Power
Station had been obtained, seem to con-
firm that the company is moving, increa-
singly in the direction of the supply of
equipment to industry.
Furthermore, in July last year it was
announced that Email had entered into
a manufacturing agreement with the
Prestolite International Corporation of
the USA to make and market certain
automotive electrical components.
The impression created is that Email
will become less reliant on home build-
ing activity than it has been in the past,
but because of the company’s size and
wide diversification it is difficult to see
any rapid increase in earning rates in the
future. This diversification on the other
hand will provide for stability and reduc-
tions in the dividend rate need not be
expected.
The earning rates of Email and AWA
have shown the following trends over the
last five years:—
Base: average 1955-56 to 1957-58 = 100
1959 1960 1961 1962 1963
AWA 135 137 94 133 130
Email 117 115 84 117 N.A.
If we assume that earnings for 1963
will be about on a par with the 1962
level, Email is selling at 14.0 times earn-
ings as compared with AWA’s 18.3 times
earnings. In other words, in terms of
earnings, AWA is priced about 30 p.c.
greater than Email. Whether such a pre-
mium is justified in relation to the future
prospects of the two companies can only
be a matter of personal judgment.
Oince 1952 dividends per share in the
case of AWA have nearly quad-
rupled, while in the case of Email they
seem to have merely doubled. Over the
last five years Email’s record is rather
better than AWA’s since, disregarding
the special anniversary bonus dividend
of 2i p.c., Email has increased the rate
from 9 p.c. to 10 p.c. while AWA has
reduced from three years at 16 p.c. to
two years at 14 p.c. Email’s current
dividend payout is covered about 1.3
times while AWA’s is covered 1.9 times.
One comes to the conclusion with this
comparison that at current prices Email’s
shares are attractive in view of the rela-
tively high yield.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Recovery, But for How Long?
Best profit by Auto, and Gen. since ' fifties
A substantial improvement in the
demand for motor vehicles generally
set the climate for a relatively good
year for Automotive and General
Industries Ltd.
Competition was keen so that profit
margins per unit were reduced, but total
sales of £8,335,000 allowed a net profit
of £161,967, the best since the heyday
of the late fifties. However, earning rate
was still at the modest level of 9.7 p.c.
on capital.
The franchises of many automotive
distributors change from time to time.
Without dwelling on lost business, let
it be sufficient to say that where Auto-
motive and General was once one of
three Victorian distributors of Austin
vehicles, it has since August 1, 1959,
been reduced by the British Motor Cor-
poration (Aust.) Pty Ltd to the position
of a main metropolitan dealer.
The investment in Sturt Street (South
Melbourne) showrooms and service
facilities was considered excessive, and
consequently the property will be sold.
City service will be maintained in
smaller premises, and the Moorabbin
branch has been developed into a major
subtirban dealership.
The company found competition
intense in passenger and commercial
vehicle trading from within and outside
the BMC franchise during 1962-63, but
an old association with State Govern-
ment Departments helped sales in the
commercial vehicle division.
An 83 p.c. interest is held in Bryson
Industries Ltd, which distributes Jaguar
cars in NSW and Victoria. This was
acquired late in 1961 by the purchase
of a controlling interest from the Bryson
family at a price of 275. 6d. per 10s.
share. Other shareholders were offered
the same price.
In 1962-63 Bryson had a record year,
earning £117,524 profit, or 44.4 p.c.
on capital. Directors warned shareholders
not to expect such a standard for future
years.
Auto, and General reported it was
satisfied with its investment in Bryson,
whose “excellent” results were reflected
in group accounts.
In the materials handling divisions,
Auto, and General’s franchises were for
John Deere industrial equipment, Yale
and Towne forklift vehicles, and
Komatsu forklift equipment, but the
Yale and Towne franchise has been

The company holds the Peugeot con-
cession for Australia, and for the last
two years has also had the Australian
concession for Citroens. As both cars
are known for their quality, which assists
their successful merchandising, Auto, and
General aims to maintain Peugeot and
Citroen sales at maximum levels.
Tax provision of £149,169 was low
by virtue of special deductions in relation
to past losses.
Stocks, up from £1,657,620 to
£.2,082,845 are valued conservatively
after allowing for obsolescence.
Shareholders have had a lean time
since the loss in 1957 when no dividend
was paid. Although operations have been
profitable each year since then, dividends
have been very modest. In the latest
year to June 30, the rate was increased
from to 6 p.c.
No capital changes have been made
since the January, 1956, one-for-one
bonus which proved so ill-timed.
The ss. shares still fall short of par
by about Is. 10d., and the company must
earn at a higher rate to restore investors’
confidence. There are plenty of other
motor dealers’ stocks available, which
through more stable tenure of franchises
have built up a long history of high
earnings and dividends.
Current yield of 9.2 p.c. shows the
market’s estimation of the risks involved.

BRADFORD INSULATION H'GS (SA) LTD
Record Profit Earned
A delaide company Bradford Insulation
Holdings (SA) Ltd earned a record
profit in the last year to June 30, after
making several moves to substantially
reduce operating costs.
The company makes insulating
materials from mineral wool fibre, such
as slagwool made from blast furnace
slag.
Several phases of contracting were
found to be unprofitable and abandoned.
The company can now concentrate on
the fields of general lagging and in-
dustrial insulation applications.
Olympic General Products Pty Ltd, a
subsidiary of Olympic Consolidated
Industries Ltd, bought the plant which
Bradford used to manufacture Styropor,
but Bradford will continue to market
this product in South Australia for some
time yet.
The share interest held in a Sydney
company, B. I. Holdings Pty Ltd, was
sold to CSR at a “satisfactory premium”.
The company reported a profit of
£lB,OOO on the sale of investments, but
a loss of £8,364 was also incurred on
the sale of other fixed assets.
The actual trading profit was
£81,655, net of taxation (£49,659)
and depreciation (£24,099).
Since formation of the holding
company in 1959 earnings on capital
have been quite modest. Latest earning
rate was 13.6 p.c. allowing payment of
8i p.c. dividend for the second year.
Directors report the factory is ex-
tremely busy, and the order position in
August, 1963, was in excess of that for
the same time in 1962. The merchan-
dising division also is proving a valuable


adjunct to the company’s overall
activities.
The capital is 25 p.c. held by CSR,
12i p.c. by the Johns-Manville Corpora-
tion of New York, and the balance is
held by the public.
The 20s. shares are listed in Adelaide
only. A recent price of 395. 6d. gave
a yield of 5.1 p.c. The shares have not
been so high since 1960 when a one-
for-four par issue was made.
There are no indications that the
company will be requiring new funds
for working capital or expansion, so the
firm price for these shares seems sympto-
matic of the general market rise rather
than any special new attractions of this
stock.

SOFTWOOD HOLDINGS LTD
Potential in Timber Company
Inspired by the frank optimism of the
chairman’s address to shareholders
on December 5, investors have pro-
pelled the 10s. shares of Softwood Hold-
ings Ltd from 15s. 3d. in mid-November
to the present height of 245. 3d.
The event to change the character of
the company from an investment angle
was the purchase of six companies in
May, 1963, from The Kauri Timber Co.
Ltd. These companies operate in the
Mount Gambier district of South Aus-
tralia.
Their fixed assets excluding grown
timber at cost. £131,760, were at the
request of Softwood directors written
down by Kauri directors by more than
£1 million to reduce the book value of
the net assets acquired to approximate
the share price.
Softwood claims to be the largest
private producer of sawn timber in Aus-
tralia, milling at the rate of about 100
million super feet true volume measure-
ment of logs per annum.
Softwood was established as a public
company in Adelaide in 1952 to take
over a 12-year-old private company,
Softwood Products Pty Ltd. It logged
timber from pine forests, milling it to
produce sawn timber and box shooks for
Victorian and South Australian markets.
The group now has 17,586 acres of
freehold forests, and cutting rights over
20,769 acres of growing Radiata pine in
various stages of maturity. When these
forests are cleared the freeholds will be
purchased by Softwood, mostly at a pre-
determined price per acre.
The chairman (Mr E. A. Alstergren)
told shareholders at the 1963 annual
meeting that in the past development of
group forests had brought about con-
siderable financial strain in the short
term. The group was planting about
2000 acres each year with Pinus Radiata
but, apart from thinning, little or no free-
hold timber was being harvested.
The Kauri assets acquired included
the freehold of a fine stand of 1000
acres of mature forests which can be
harvested any time now, to ease any
liquidity problems.
Estimated on current royalties, the
group’s freehold plantations are putting
on over £270,000 worth of timber each
year. While the company is harvesting
very little, most of this annual growth is
adding to inner reserves, but not as yet
showing up much in profits.
Integration of the new companies
brought a larger scale of production to
considerably reduce costs.
Although the Kauri acquisition was
only made late in the year, it had some
effect on profits because group tax pro-
vision was minimised by the losses
carried forward by these companies.
Profit, in fact, rose from £86,814 to
£120,420 in the year to June 30, after
providing £8,451 for tax compared with
£31,720 the year before.
The exact purchase price of the Kauri
deal is not disclosed, but the accounts
show a current liability of £127,112 and
a long-term liability repayable after
June 30, 1964, of £318,757.
These obligations will be fulfilled by
the one-for-two par issue to shareholders
at May 27, 1963, and a one-for-three
par issue scheduled for December, 1964
(raising paid capital by £393,570 to
£786,484), and a long-term loan of
£200,000 repayable over nine years
after an initial period without repay-
ment.
Directors envisage no trouble in 1964
in paying the usual 10 p.c. dividend on
capital increased by the one-for-two
issue, at the same time adding sub-
stantially to reserves.
The company obviously made careful
estimates of future profits at the time of
the Kauri assets purchase, and directors
were pleased to report that group profits
for the first quarter of 1963-64 con-
siderably exceeded budget, and sales in
October were also higher than con-
sidered probable.
Softwood should not be confused
with the numerous old forestry com-
panies which allowed investors to buy
acre forest lots that were held in trust,
but which rarely were a financial success
and have mostly sunk into oblivion.
Its financing methods are entirely
orthodox, and the company is rapidly
assuming very attractive investment
qualities.
Dividends have been no less than 9
p.c. since incorporation, and, apart from
1957, the company has easily cleared
those dividend commitments.
A par issue in 1954 without specific
rights to shareholders, and a redeemable
cumulative participating preference issue
in 1956 have also been made.
Investors are rarely given such a com-

prehensive picture of a company’s
financial intentions.
Apart from the possibility of fire, the
company s income should continue to
flow uninterruptedly. The company
claims its mills are capably managed
and producing efficiently, so that the
profit picture is an encouraging one.
Discerning investors have already
recognised the potential of this company
to push the share price up smartly since
the chairman’s address.
Current yield is 4.1 p.c., but this
expands to 5.8 p.c. when the next issue
is taken into account. The shares could
see a top price of perhaps 25s. cum the
rights, and are certainly still worth seek-
ing on Adelaide and Melbourne markets
at current levels.

Speculator’s Diary
Tt was nice to see Philip Morris move
A up Is. 6d. during the week, vindica-
ting my judgment. The stock has had a
remarkable period of growth and should
move much higher failing any further
adverse medical reports. But if any re-
port did eventuate it might create an-
other favorable buying opportunity.
The general market has been far from
exciting. Even Dr Coombs’ £42 million
call-up to the Reserve Bank left the
market undisturbed, though no doubt
it was largely anticipated.
Finding nothing to spark my
enthusiasm I switched my attention
during the week to the oil and mining
market. Those who may read this diary
(i.e., more than once) will recall that
my success in these fields has been
variable.
With my oil investments, Fate seemed
to be always against me, and rarely have
I made even the smallest profit. General
mining has been much more successful;
one of my last ventures into this field
was with Pacific Island Mines options
which netted me one of my quickest and
largest profits ever.
First, looking at the oil market, I
thought that Santos had come down
sufficiently to 16s. to be worth an
interest. The company’s current well,
Gidgealpa No. 2, must have almost
reached basement and certainly investors
seem to have anticipated this.
I am hoping that when the company
announces its intention as regards further
drilling there will be a recovery in share
prices. Rumor had it that American
buying was the main pressure behind
recent price increases. It would not be
surprising as the stock has a wide
following in the US.
Anyhow, I am not alone in my judg-
ment. One financial journal picked it
out as the oil stock of the year. Tempt-
ing Fate, I bought 600 at 16s.
Second transaction was the purchase
of 800 Aberfoyle rights at Bs. This
company has received quite an amount
of limelight in the last three months
with BHP taking a 25 p.c. interest, and
with the sharp rise in tin prices. Profits
of the company should be well up this
year with higher revenues and more
efficient plant in operation at the Aber-
foyle mine.
The company is the senior partner in
the Aberfoyle Tin Development partner-
ship which intends to float off two large
operations later this year. Being a share-
holder in Aberfoyle should give one
prior rights in any flotation.
My man James tells me that the
second is well worth waiting for. He
also tells me that the only thing keeping
back a tin boom at the moment is sales
from the US stockpile. The buffer stock
used by the International Tin Council
in London to hold down prices has now
been exhausted.
I was reluctant to sell anything this
week to pay for my purchases, but
decided to quit my holding of Steam-
ships Trading. In comparison with W. R.
Carpenter they still look cheap, but at
the current price of 14s. 6d. they were
looking very static. Sales of these
yielded me a nice profit of £llO and a
debit in the account of £l4B.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Fallacies in Meat Exporting
Japanese delegation changes its views
fallacy inherent in so much of
our thinking on “export to Asia”
was highlighted very nicely during the
visit to NSW and Victoria by the 23-
man Japanese meat trade delegation.
The fallacy is this: You cannot, in the
case of primary animal products, reduce
prices simply by increasing production.
It works, of course, if you are making
plastic buckets, or nuts and bolts, or,
most unfortunately for our wool in-
dustry, if you are making synthetic
fabrics. You build your factory, hire
your staff, and then “turn on the tap”.
You can, to a certain extent, do much
the same thing with wheat or other
crops. You plant bigger acreages and
hope it rains.
But wool comes from sheep and beef
from cattle Sheep and cattle are not
raw materials. They are four - footed
living things which have to reproduce
themselves. They need food to eat and,
if they are to thrive in health, they need
care and attention. The more wool or
beef expected of them, the more they
need.
The Japanese trade delegation in-
formed Press and radio interviewers in
Sydney and Melbourne that Australia
was backward in exploiting the potentially
enormous Japanese meat market. We
were passing up the chance of making
millions, because we were doing nothing
to promote our meat in Japan.
It made good reading . . . particularly
the reminders that Japanese people now
were adopting Western eating habits and
that the fish supplies were running out
in the closer waters and were becoming,
therefore, much more expensive. Japan-
ese trawlers were now operating as far
from Japan as Greenland and South
America.
A picture of 100 million Japanese
eager to buy Australian beef and mutton
was conjured up . . . then the picture
disintegrated.
Australian meat exporters pointed out
that the only reason we were not sending
more meat to Japan was that the Japan-
ese were not prepared to pay the price.
North America was taking all the
surplus meat we could supply. New
Zealand was sending more meat to Japan
than Australia, but this was meat which
NZ could not place on the North
American market.
The Japanese visitors, most in the
foodstuffs processing business, sensed
that something was amiss and in later
interviews in Melbourne retracted most
of the things they had said on their
arrival.
Being extremely courteous people, they
were particularly upset that they had
given an impression that Australia was
doing nothing in the way of research
and promotion in Japan.
Their hosts here, the Australian Meat
Board, had in fact conducted an extensive
survey of market prospects in Japan and
should the North American market be
denied us it would take little time to
place meat in Japan but at a reduced
price.
The survey showed that Australian
sliced meats, packaged and product
identified, were enoying a ready sale in
Japan. However, unlike the bulk bone-
less consignments to North America,
these sliced meats were in a higher price
range aimed at a selective market.
One of the difficulties in sending beef
(this does not apply to mutton where the
only barrier is price) to Japan is the
quota system imposed by the Japanese
Government.
Australia did seek a firm agreement
giving us a guaranteed quota during the
recent re-negotiation of the Australia-
Japan Trade Agreement, but nothing
came of it.
Probably this difficulty is not insur-
mountable. We could, after all, allow in
a few more Japanese cars or machine
tools. But the question of price remains.
One might ask: If we cannot supply
beef and mutton to Japan at worthwhile
prices, how can we ever expect to step
up meat exports to other parts of Asia?
Japan, by comparison, is the rich nation
of Asia.
The best suggestion to date is that
a fund be created to offset initial losses


A Lot Of
Hot Air
Not much could be done about it, once.
Now it is being moved by the TON.
People have really grown to like fresh
air. They all want better air conditions
free from smoke, odours and stuffi-
ness. Ever since man developed the art
of trapping air in rooms, things seem to
have got out of hand. A good cool
draught is usually a welcome phrase in
either shade of meaning and a controlled,
forced air draught through any building
will usually lower temperatures, remove
all stale air, smoke, cooking odours and
the like and replace continuously with
clean, filtered air. The wonderful thing
is that it can be done for such small
cost.

(representatives in all States)
in selling to Japan until such time as the
Japanese economy, rising steadily, is able
to pay what we ask.
The next question is: Who is going
to provide the fund?
Australian producers, already oper-
ating on slender profit margins, could
not possibly provide the money them-
selves. They will even have doubts about
paying the proposed levy for promotion
of meat, similar to the levy for the pro-
motion of wool.
The money would obviously have to
come from some other source inevit-
ably the Commonwealth Government. It
would be a case of priming just another
pump from the tap of Government
subsidy.

VTictoria’s Chief Secretary, Mr Arthur
" Rylah, has launched a campaign
against cruelty to animals in stock
transports. He has asked police and
transport officials to implement existing
provisions in the law. And he has
brought the matter to the attention of a
law revision committee, at present con-
sidering several proposed amendments to
various statutes, to discover if there are
loopholes which need blocking.
Mr Rylah announced his move follow-
ing a case before South Melbourne Court.
A South Australian transport driver was
fined £5O on two charges of mistreating
animals. The Court was told that the
cattle had been trucked from Adelaide
to Melbourne without food or water for
the 20-hour journey.
This South Melbourne case is not
the only recent example of a fine being
imposed, but the picture is not so bad
as that inferred by a recent letter to a
newspaper which stated: “Hardly a week
goes by that some unfortunate calf or
lamb is not maimed for life.”
As hardly a week goes by in Victoria
in which fewer than 15,000 cattle and
100,000 sheep are transported by road
to and from markets the casualty rate
may be judged to be rather low as a
percentage.
Now a visiting New Zealander, Mr
Conway Lennon, who is president of the
Royal Federation of New Zealand
Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals, has entered the fray.
Said Mr Lennon: “I feel the trans-
port of stock in Australia is chaotic as
far as the humane treatment of animals
is concerned. There is no provision for
food and water on long journeys and no
provision for off-loading to give the
animals a rest.
“In Victoria I have seen more cruelty
in transport of stock than in any other
State in Australia. The handling of
bobby calves at Dandenong market is
the most beastly, inhumane treatment of
domestic stock I’ve ever seen.”
Disclaimers quickly pounced on Mr
Lennon. One, significantly from the Vic-
torian RSPCA, said that the charge that
Victoria was the worst State for cruelty
was “utterly absurd”.
Another stated simply that Mr Lennon
would have to see more cruelty to bobby
calves at Dandenong than anywhere else
because Dandenong happens to handle
more bobby calves than anywhere else.
The fact was that, considering the num-
bers involved, cruelty was the exception.
On television a man, representing a
body which campaigns against not only
the treatment of domestic animals but
also zoos and circuses, made some telling
remarks. He admitted, to an interviewer,
that he did happen to be a vegetarian.
The Melbourne “Herald”, in an
editorial supporting Mr Rylah’s moves,
said: “Many cases of cruelty are likely
to go on passing unnoticed while the
present harsh and illogical long hauls to
slaughter stay part of a primitive system.
The transport of carcases rather than of
live animals would reduce the suffering.”
More inland killing centres —and pre-
sumably that is what the editorial was
referring to although it did not exactly
say it —would obviously.be a good idea
. . . provided the public did not have
to pay for them per medium of more
expensive meat.
On the question of bobby calves, it
would be better, both from an economic
as well as a humane view, to market
the calves on the property or at an age
when they are strong enough to stand
the rigors of a haul to market.
So, in fact, do many dairy farmers
who are usually on “first name” terms
with their cows and who, from child-
hood, have become hardened to the
ritual of depriving cows of their calves
at birth because it is a necessary fact of
milk production.
A way out, economically, has been
mentioned in these pages before. This is
the feeding of concentrated foods to
calves so that they may be raised to
vealer stage without suckling their
mothers.
But, whether as bobby or vealer, the
calf must eventually be killed. This is
a fact of life which many of the letter
writers, and the gentleman on TV, refuse
to acknowledge.
One thing which annoys stockmen is
the assumption by critics that, as they
feel they need three meals a day (which
in any case is open to question), so do
cattle and sheep. This is nonsense.
Cattle and sheep roaming on proper-
ties will frequently drink only once a
day and two days without food or water
is often not a great discomfort. Some-
times it is, of course, as in the case
before South Melbourne Court, but what
constitutes cruelty in January century-
plus heat may not at other times.
Racehorses, the pampered darlings of
the animal world, are frequently de-
prived of food and water for two days
or more if they come in from the spelling
paddock in gross condition. (A similar
course might do a lot of human beings
much more good than more kindly re-
ducing diets.)
A distinction should be, but rarely is,
made between what is cruelty by design
and what is cruelty by accident a
broken axle causing delay, a sudden
swerve to avoid a cyclist and so on.
One of the difficulties is that the
modern driver of a road transport is
sometimes a stockman and sometimes
just a truck driver. In the old days a
drover had to be a stockman.
By and large, road transports do the
job of moving stock from one place to
another more quickly and economically
than any other means.
Drought is no longer the scourge it

One thing, competition.
The manufacturer who does not improve his product or
service to the public to keep ahead'of his competitors, fails.
Competition is the driving force that is the spur to progress.
In Australia there are many banks, each in competition for

Occasionally there is cruelty but
rarely is it by design.
Our First
Large-Scale
Cotton Harvest
TT'or 40 years or more cotton has been
grown in a small way in Queens-
land under natural rainfall. As an
industry it didn’t amount to much,
although as a supplementary operation
cotton-growing provided some farmers
with an extra crop. Now, however, the
southern district in NSW has added
cotton to its other primary industries
and growing it by means of irrigation.
The first large-scale commercial cotton
crops will be harvested late next month.
More than 3000 acres are under
cotton in the Riverina and Murrum-
bidgee Irrigation Area so far, and the
crop is expected to yield at least 6 million
pounds weight of cotton, or 2000 lbs
per acre.
To handle this crop, the cotton
division of Rice Growers Co-operative
Mills Ltd, at Darlington Point. 30 miles
from Griffith, is erecting a modern type
cotton gin at a cost of £130,000. The
complete gin, weighing 90 tons dead-
weight, or 300 cubic tons, was manu-
factured in USA by- the Continental
Ginning Co. of Alabama.
Five years of research and trials went
into developing this area for the irriga-
tion of cotton, and the water comes
from the giant Snowy Mountains project.
Australia has been importing annually
more than £4O million worth of cotton.
This new industry, therefore, should
prove of benefit to the national economy.
Mr A. D. Mackellar, chairman of
Rice Growers Co-operative Mills Ltd,
regards the Riverina and Murrumbidgee
Irrigation Area as most suitable for
cotton - growing. Many of the rice
farmers have been growing cotton, too,
and find the combination ideal.
In addition to the cotton gin, the
company is building an edible oil
extraction plant to process the cotton
seed. This plant, costing £250,000, will
be erected at Griffith. Thus farmers in
this area will have a threefold interest—
cotton, cotton seed oil and rice.
