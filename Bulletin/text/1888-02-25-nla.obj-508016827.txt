SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 25 1888
Australia’s Sham Cobden.
The recent Centennial of Australia was cele-
brated in about every fashion possible to worn-out
and unoriginal man. Sunday schools, pugilistic
clubs, temperance societies, and Licensed Vic-
tuallers organisations, and foreign-trade associa-
tions all combined to irradiate the picnic. But
the Press were discreetly silent, or merely gave a
brief report of those attempts at celebration
which suggested severe frosts, or threw a pallid
ray of discredit on the alleged greatness of the
foreign-trade colony of New South Wales.
* *
Amongst other things which the enlightened
Press glozed over, the so-called Freetrade Associa-
tion of New South Wales did its little twinkle by
way of shedding a halo of glory on the continents’
first hundredth birthday. The professors of the
doctrine of Cobdenism in Sydney felt called upon
to roll up and explain that they felt glad that
England’s privilege to shoot garbage upon Austra-
lia’s shores was still unimpaired. In the good old
days Great Britain sent out her shoddy subjects
and now she sends out her shoddy goods. At the
recent conversazione the shoddy Premier of New
South Wales made a speech, and waved his white
beard over the glittering festival. There were
ladies present, and the snowy-craniumed Parkes
somewhat injured the customary vigour of his
oratory, in his attempts to temper the verbal wind
to the ear of,the shorn lamb of similitude. Con.
sequently he could only slightly refer en passant
to the artificial production of hybrids, and he was
compelled, in a general way, to knock the strength
out of his vocabulary by the use of such weak
and effeminate words and phrases as “ bed of cor-
ruption,” “fcetid," “he lived amongst dirt,”
“the devil,” “arrant turncoats,” &0., and the
likening of a political oppsnent to “ a mad dog.”
Had ladies not been present Parses might have
struck the chords of higher flights on the oratori-
cal hand-organ, and perhaps would have reached
the level of a SuTroß-slanging Bathurst peroration.
Sir Henry opened out With Remark to the effect
that any intelligent roan or woman who could be
placed on the stage of Australian public life—by
which he meant Sydney public life—without being
“mixed up” with any “petty cabals” and
“ mean straggles ” would be heartily as-
tonished to find any set of men “ bring-
ing the creatare of Protection into a land like
this.” He did, not, however, enter into a de-
scription of his own various and multitudinous
connections with “petty cabals” and “mean
struggles,” neither did he explain the nature of
the objection which influenced a jury of his own
countrymen, on two separate occasions, in declin-
ing to grant him that justification which places
a statesman above suspicion in regard to “ petty
cabals” or “mean struggles” in which he may
be “mixed up.” The phrase, “a country like
this," dominated the whole deliverance. Sir
Henry’s speech was a piece of unblushing but-
tering of Australia. It was not strictly truthful
either. It was the bribe of verbal flattery flung
as a sop to the Cerberus that guards the ballot
box and allows Parkes and his creatures a lease
of misrule. “ Free and sunbright land of ours,”
“ this glorious land,” “ our condition of life was
liberty itself," the creed of Australian Parkesites
was as “ free, as full, and as beneficent as the
sunlight of Heaven," “ the light of the liberty
they possessed,” “the free and buoyant air of this
country,” “a holy cause,” &c., were some of the
flowers of rhetoric by which Sir Henry sought to
marmalade the unthinking youth of Australia, lhe
entire speech was a distortion of fact and a bilious
piece of invective hurled against opposition. All
those who thought differently to himself he de-
scribed men as with—
▲ stubborn disposition, with a narrow brow, with barren
sympathies.
After exhausting his slim list of stock-phrases in
denouncing Protection as the creature and out-
come of darkness, degradation, ignorance, and cor-
ruption, he turned off on the sentimental tack, and
said that he was disatisfied wit a the term “ Free-
trade,” andproposed that of “the Cause of Human
Liberty” as a suitable synonym. “ Human
liberty ! ” yes, the liberty to tax the beer and the
tobacco, the tea and the sugar used by the poor ;
the liberty to let land go free, and property to
rear its head untaxed ; the liberty to hamper the
producer by absurd duties on raw material, while
letting the manufactured article co me in free ; the
liberty to prevent thousands of people working
and* enjoying the fruits of their labour. If Sir
Henry means this, we agree with him, but not
otherwise. He really desires to find a fresh
phrase for his own policy, in order that he may
shunt Cobden at the moment it suits him, and
enable him to “dish” the growing party of Pro-
tection when the election straw points to a change
of wind.
* * *
It will, at least, be gratifying to the great
peoples of Europe—if they should ever hear of
air Henry’s speech—to the Germans, the Bel-
gians, the Russians, the French, as well as to the
great American people, to know that the Protec-
tionist is a poor, miserable creature who ‘ wanted
corruption,” “monopoly,’ and a “foetid atmo
sphere.” He said that the stickler for the rights
of the producer wa3
About as much out of place in this glorious land as some
nondescritt creature, partly a platypus and partly a flying
f x, would be in the woods of England.
Sir Henry might have made his simile the com-
pleter by adding, “ about as much out of place as
s ome nondescript creature, partly journeyman but-
ton maker, partly renegade Chartist, partly tide-
waiter, partly political charlatan, partly bogus
patriot, partly experienced insolvent, would be
in this ‘ free and sunbright land of ours’” To
say of an opponent that “ he lived amongst dirt ’
is a compliment which will no doubt be greatly
appreciated by the ghosts of such men as Thomas
Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, if Parkes’
speech ever gets to its fitting home in the land of
shades. The sham old Democratic hocupser pre-
tended to pay a compliment o Ninian Melville
by recognising in him the leader of Protection in
New South Wales. This was evidently done to
spite Mr. Heydon and Mr. Dibbs ; but although
Parkes assumed a certain amount of “ something
like respect” for Messrs. Melville and Lus-
combe and gave it as his opinion that the leader-
ship of the Protectionist party should be the meed
of the former gentleman, this grand and perfect
old Chesterfield could not restrain his eomp'i-
mentary tongue He said that though Ninian
Melville, aa.P., had
A higher endowment aud ability than any of the other
gentlemen,
though he had
Consistently advocated Protection all his life ... ha
had done it wish an amount of vigour which had often re-
minded him (Sir Henry) of a mad dog.
Mr. Melville is at least many things that Sir
Henry Parkes is not. He is human-hearted and
has been politically sincere and consistent for
more than 20 years. He sympathises genuinely
in human trouble and bereavement. He repre-
sents his constituency in a thousand different ways
fc ir Henry would never even dream of. He talks
to them on politics on week days and he preaches
to them on Sundays. If a miner dits in the
Northumberland electorate, Melville at once
proceeds to his home, comforts the widow
and children, makes a collection for them, and
of .en, out of his slender purse, heads the list him
self. Then he buries the corpse acd reads the
funeral service over it, and minimises the ex-
penses of the affair to those left behind. Sir
Henry has never done as much for one of his
creditors, yet this is the man who entertains
and instructs women by describing an opponent
in their presence as a “mad dog.” There are
dogs in the world, savage, inhuman tykeß, that
are not mad, or, if they are, not confined where
they would do no harm to a world weary of their
incessant barking.
Sir Henry recollects, no man better, that he
once held Protectionism views and delivered Pro-
tectionist speeches. It is not so very long since
that he cheered the emplojees of Mort’s Hock
with a discourse upon colonial-made locomotive!.
And then, as to his pre ent colkaguts.
Sutherland, by compulsion a silent adjunct of a
Freetrade Ministry, is a well-known Protectiot ist.
Hay-and-corn daties Clarke is a Protectionist
caught red-handed and snatched into the im-
porters’ ring. The insipid Roberts is a Protec-
tionist, and advocated timber duties in deference
to the promptings tf bis cotsdtuents. Garrett,
two years ago or thereabout, delivered a
fiercely Protectionist speech at Camden,
which New South Wales has not yet had
time to forget. Three-ball Abigail, who is the
uncle just as Parkes is the fath. r of the people,
vyas once a virulent Protectionist, and, upon
proof of his guilt, owes The Bulletin the sum of
£25 at compound interest for two years. Burns,
by his action in regard to the butter and bacon
duties, is practically proved to be a Protectionist.
In consideration of all these well-known facts, Sir
Henry, at the Freetrade conversazione, said :
Nearly the whole of the party who were trampling through
the country as advocates of Protection were the most arrant
turn-coats that this or any other country ever saw.
After this, cimment is needless. The utterance
coincides so well with the known facts that it
carries its own dark and devious explanation.
# •
Parkes is becoming more and more a confirmed
Imperialist, and no speech of his nov ever
terminates without a reference to the “beloved
mother country.” Sir Henry Parkes is
now a G.C.M.G., a distinction conferred so re-
markably appropriately upon his assistance in
steering his Naval Defence Colonial Subsidy £ ill
through the New South Wales Parliament that it
looks sufficiently like the price of his services.
After an amou t of twaddle respecting what the
“ beloved mother country ” had done to forward
her own inte. ests, Parkes brought his speech to
a conclusion with a prophecy that “ Protection
could not last long in the free atmosphere of
the United States.” But where is the
evidence to warrant such an utterance? America
waB once, li<te some of the Australian
colonies at present, a place wherein Ping-
land could dump her manufactured garbage
and shoot her shoddy goods. Since that time
the population of the States has almost quintupled
and America stands to-day one of the fore
most rivals of England in the competition for the
world s commerce. Is it likely that America will
kick away the stool by w'hich she rose to power
and follow the example of the Cobdens of
N, q .W ? The greatness of the United States
rest i upon her Protective policy, and even should
America now bj in a position to dispense with it,
that would be no argument, but rather the re-
verse, for a young country not to follow her
example and adopt a polioy ol Protection against
the world. Parkes, of course, had his little fling
at Russia, a country in which, to use his own
choice phraseology, ‘ ‘ Protection reigned supreme.”
That is so but look at the tremendous strides
Russia has made as a great power since Peter
the Great only a couple of hundred years
ago bequeathed that famous legacy to his
country ii which he counselled the gradual
absorption of English gold by giving for it Russian
exports; and, weighed in the balance with the
White Tsar, the hairy Bismarck of Australia is a
dark and miserable failure as a balance-dropper,
Instead of being an exposition of the principles of
Freetrade, if it has any principles, Sir Henry’s
speech was a personal attack distinguished for
bitter invective and spiteful calumny. Instead of
being a philosophical discourse, it was a vulgar
tirade couched in the intemperate vapourings of a
Billingsgate fish-wife.
The Land Swindle in Victoria.
r he “ real property ” boom in Victoria is still on,
and seems likely to continue. The conditions
prevalent must have the effect of attracting at"
tention to the general land question, and the
topics of nationalisation, the right to the unearned
increment, and others cognate, will be again to
the fore. In defence of the unearned increment
it has been said that this is merely the interest on
money locked up for years in land. We pause
here to inquire whether there is any natural pro-
cess by which interest comes at all to money
that is locked up ?
* * *
The interest on money invested in land should
come, as in the case of other investments, from
use, and not disuse, of the subject of investment.
If a man has a hundred pounds and uses it in
business, he may reap a very good return. If he
J ends it out in any fashion, then, other things
beiDg equal, it must yield him less, as the real
user has to make his profit also. If he puts it
away in his safe it is obvious that he will not gain
any increase.
* * *
Now, if he exchanges it for land—which, in res-
pect of value for value, is just the same as
exchanging silver for gold, or gold for silver—and
if he uses that land, the profits arising will be
proportioned to the use that he makes of it. If he
lets the land, or lends it out, granting, for the
time being only, his right to do so, inasmuch as
he has paid money for it —still, other things being
equal, he should receive less for the same reason ;
and still, if he lets it lie idle, there is no moral
reason why any interest should come to him, nor
any natural expectation, apart from the pecu-
liarity of social conditions, that any will.
But this is not all. The “ interest’ which
he does draw is about on a par, so far as
the morality of the action is concerned, with his
charging a borrower or a changer of money in-
terest upon it for the time it has been in his own
possession. Let Landgrab go to Moses for a
loan or to get a sovereign in exchange for silver:
Quoth Moses, “I have had this coin a year. I
want my interest for that time as well as for the
time jou have it,” and Landgrab would be the
first to say, “How can you expect me to pay you
exrept for the time I deprive you of it, or to give
you a premium when I give you the full equiva-
lent at once V' It is merely the scarcity of land in
certain places, or rather of places upon the land,
which enables him to extort blackmail from
others, just as Moses might extort forty shillings
for a sovereign if gold happened to become mono.
polised in a similar manner.
• • *
In the latter case, it is obvious that the sove-
reign was not ta'ienasa marketable commodity
in the first instance, and it is also obvious that if
anyone did take it as such, he had no right to do
to. Ihe State retains the power to call in any
currency at any time, and none can dispute
this is just. It was issued by the nation, and- its
surface value is the only property that has been
transferred. If the raw material, by any scarcity
becomes dearer so much as to disturb the propor-
tions of the circulating medium, the obvious, cer.
tain, and equitable, as well as legal, remedy is for
the nation to call in the affected metal, and ex-
change the coins for new ones having in reality
the value (as reckoned in the unaffected currency)
which they purport to have, so that in the instance
supposed, everybody would, without loss, ex-
change his present sovereigns for sovereigns of
half the size, and the State would retain the re-
maining half of the gold to apply, without the
need of taxation, for national purposes.
. * •
It is precisely in the same manner that the
nation issued land to its first holders —in Aus-
tralia, at least, most unequivocally so. And just
so is it entitled to the “scarcity increment” of
it. The particular method of laying hands upon
it must vary according to the form of the Consti-
tution, but the thing itself—nationalisation—or
rather the reclamation, from private appropria-
tion that which is National —is a necessity alike
of justice and of simple policy.
The Unchartered. “Banks” of Sydney.
Starting a deposit and discount bank, or
any alleged institution of the sort, is mere
child’s-play in Sydney, wherein all manner of im-
position is specially favoured by an indulgently
interpreted law. An oyster-shop in a third-rate
street is abandoned by its distressed and despair-
ing proprietor; the situation is not good enough
to ensure the small amount of patronage required
for the successful conduct of business, so the
shutters are put up, and the place becomes
vacant. A lemonade man conns along, but his
offers to “sling squash” meet with no response,
and he also abandons the premises. Then a
Chinaman looks at the place with a view to run-
ning it as a fan-tan shop, but the prospect is nob
encouraging, and he declines to venture. Yeb
the era of glory for that shop is at hand. A man
with a reasonably English or even aggres-
sively English name, the face of a thrice-
convicted thief, and the voice of a Dutch
German Jew comes into possession. He reforms
The front of the premises, puts in large plate-glass
windows, frosts tne glass thereof, and upon it in-
cribos the leg-md ‘ 1 Hemispherian Loan, Mort-
gage, Di -mount Deposit Financial and Mercantile
Dank and Patent Resurrection Pay Building So-
ciety (Limited). Capital £2,000,000. Office-hours
10 to 3. 10 to 12 noon, and Btolo p m. on
Saturdays. Directors : Grasper O’Greedy,
Rgq., Hardup Scratcher, Ksq , Leonidas Wash-
ington Ananias, Esq., Barabbas Hornyhand, Esq.,
and P. N. Threemonths, Esq., William Jobson,
Manager. Balaam Sass, Secretary.” Then he
sits inside and waits. Likely as not he can’t raise
the price of a box of matches until a depositor
comes along, and if an intending borrower
saunters around in those early times he has
to wait until a depositor planks down enough to
s apply the borrower’s requirements before the
loan can be effected. It is a little bit wonderful
that customers don’t oftener realise the actual posi-
t ion of these fearfully and wonderfully made insti-
tutions. Just lately a temporarily impecunious
s rburbanite arranged to borrow £5 on the security
o’ a second mortgage over a time-payment semi-
grand piano. The security was duly signed, and
ihe usual 60 per cant and expenses agreement
prepared, but still the bank failed to produce the
dollars. Day after day the borrower applied in
vain, until, when nearly a week had elapsed,
tie bank official handed over the amount partly
ia shillings and half crowns. Whether he had
burgled a church or robbed a saveloy-stall is nob
known, but appearances seemed to clearly indi 1
cate either one or the other of those felonies. Yet
fhis was a “Bank” with an alleged capital of
I eaven knows how many thousands, and with
a full-blown directorate of not unknown men.
Where the alleged capital gets to is always a deep
mystery to those who put any faith in pro-
s lectuses. The only preliminary expenses in
starting such a show would seem to be the gild-
ing and adornment of the magnificent window-
front which is always a prominent feature of these
nondescript banks. Blazoned lies on frosted and
painted glass, and magnificent titles engraved on
i erpetually refulgent brass seem to appeal with ir-
resistible force to small capitalists who wish to rn-
v st their meagre savings at several per cent., and
i o unfortunate slaves of misfortune who are willing
to mortgage the equity of redemption of the
household sewing-machine at 100 per cent, per
a mum or over. The gorgeous window is a trap
t » catch the unwary, and the names of poli-
ticians is a part of the swindle.
# * #
The facility with which even politicians actually
i i Parliament can te sometipaes induced to
1 nd their potential names to public shams
of the incorporated company order is one
of the peculiar features of the unchartered
‘ banks ” and phi anthropic institutions. The
names of Si- Henry Parkes, Jacob Garrard,
and J. H. Young no doubt availed to catch
many victims on behalf of the “ Austra-
-lan Mutual Prudential and Medical As-
surance Company.” Men were enticed into
that trap only to find, when the thing burst up,
that the alleged security afforded by those mag-
nificent names was valueless for all practical pur-
poses. The members named certainly were
paraded as directors, but when the crash came
each pleaded ignorance —an ignorance appa
lenily born of sheer carelessness—of all
the peculiar transactions recorded against
the Society. And so it has always been.
There never yet was a public company
swindle so gross as to be unable to em-
I ody, for a time at least, the name of a
designing or foolish member of Parliament in
i s directorate. And until present laws are
amended all through, it is safe to prophesy that
t here never will be.

Fortunately for the 200 per shent harpies, the
l iws relating ti banks are in New South Wales in
a ghastly state of confusion. The statute i Vio.
No. 13 has been amended by 12 Vio. No 21, the
tatter Act making the word “ bank” include a l l
institutions receiving money on deposit; but as
the former Act had already been amended by 7
Vic. No 16, of which amendment 42 Yic. is
entirely oblivious, there would now be some
doubt as to (he possibi ity of applying the pro-
visions of any one of the three Acts against
philanthropists of the 200 per shent species. The
Courts, in any case, would be hound to apply the
aws in the manner most widely contrary to the
laws of commonsense, and therefore it would be a
hazardous bu iness to trust to any statuses now in
force. What is wanted is a law providing for a
deposit in the Treasury of, say, £20,000 as a con-
dition precedent to the opening of any institution
desiring to do any banking business ; then there
would be none of these unchartered “Banka”
carrying on lucrative businesses on the security of
t quitable liens on the family fire-irons. Then
would the “ Bank”safes cea'e to bulge with bills of
sale over Brummagem watches and wheelbarrows ;
then could a man be sure that when he went to
cash a friend s cheque he would not be elbowed
by a burglar seeking to ‘ hypothecate,” to use the
elegant Mr Mortimer FRANKLYN’sphrase, the pro-
ceeds of nocturnal plunder. Then would public
men cease to excite suspicion by permitting
their names to be advertised as “Directors” of
grandly-titled and strangely-conducted pawn-
shops.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
OF Australian interest.
The “ Government House party” in Melbourne is
quietly and stealthily preparing the way for that
inevitable Bill which will clap a few more thou-
sands oa to the annual salary of Sir Henry Loch.
For the current year His Excellency has been
voted a bonus of £(5000 to meed the expenses of
Exhibition hospitalities, and a big effort will be
made to keep that bonus (or five-sixths of it) on
the Estimates, as a permanent if. ere if eto the
gubernatorial loot. A first public whisper of the
intended job comes, as might be expect' d, from
the ROCS, which recently reminded His Ex’s,
(what a suggestive abbreviation!) faithful squat-
ters and devoted hat gers-on that “the special
vote is only to be regarded as a stopgap. Two
things, it must be remembered, have happened
since the salary of the Governor was fixed in
Victoria. We have moved him from a suburban
house to a city mansion or palace. . , . The
revenue of the colony has risen from £3,000,000 to
£7,000,000 ppr annum, and private expenditure
has increased in proportion. Even as the Tory
paper puts it, this is a miserably weak case for
dear Sir Henry, for the very arguments advanced
in favour of the job can be turned against it.
The “mansion or palace," with its scarecrow


tower, is an extra charge on the colony, not con*
template*! when the Governcr’s salary was fixed,
and the natural increase in wealth has brought
about a natural decrease in tbo.cost of living. In
point of fact, the purchasing power if £IO,OOO has
grown almost in the same ratio as the Victorian
revenue, so th at the fortunate Loch is decidedly bet-
ter off than were his predecessors. And the Argus
says neve” a word about that new country resi-
dence at iuuunt Macedon, where the great man
and his family put in a considerable part of their
valuable time, and enjoy themselves in a rustic,
rentless, economical style. The mountain retreat
was father to the bonus, and the bonus is progeni
tor to the additional salary, at the christening of
which Melbourne sassiety hopes to dance. With
a few extra thousands to spend in cheap enter-
tainment, Sir Henry Loch and his “affable”
Lady will be able to further extend their
precious circle and secure another batch of
adherents to the sacred causa of snob-
bery, already powerful in Victoria. On that
ground the Argus is bonnetting for the local
representative of our Gracious Queen, and on that
ground the raising of a Governor’s “ screw” is not
merely a matter of financial interest to one colony
alone, but of political moment to all true Austra-
lians. Every penny of public money paid into our
vice-regal exchequers is indirectly spent on manu-
facturing grovel and pushing along Imperial
Federation. As in England with its Goo-anointed
Queen, so in Australia with its Brummagem sove-
reigns. The people find funds to support their
, natural enemy. A nd if Victoria is so eager to
hand over more treasures to her particular official
foe, we shall soon feel the effects of such folly in
New South Wales and the, other colonies. To
preserve the Balance of Snobbery on this young
Continent is a matter of all-round Australian in-
terest, but it looks as though the “ Court ” party
in Victoria is resolved that she shall acquire a
preponderating influence in this miserable respect.
The last sentence ought to be cabled home by
Reuter.

Shams—Medical and Oilier.
It is difficult at all times for a lawyer to be con-
sistent, but for the Attorney-General of a New
South Wales Freetrade Ministry the difficulty
swells to the dimensions of a large-sized impossi-
bility. Mr. Wise discovered this, and that gay
and fresh young man gave himself away to a
greater extent than any other living politician has
in his efforts to show that there should be freetrade
in everything but law, and Mr. Simpson, his suc-
cessor, who is old enough to know better, has
fallen into the same old mudhole at the very out-
set of his career. In the New South Wales Upper
House last week, the sleepy legislators awoke to
realise that Mr. Creed, M.L.C, was hammering
away at his old antipathy—the unlicensed doctors
of the colony —and for the five hundredth time
was urging their instant suppression. The Select
Committee which some time ago sat upon the
question of these hangers-on to science ascertained
that the mother colony of Australia was overrun
with shoemakers and pick-and shovel men who
were making fortunes by tinkering with the
human frame ; that dustmen and local preachers
had set up by hundreds as specialists in brain-
diseases ; that broken-down storekeepers, who
called themselves doctors, performed weird surgi-
cal operations upon the ignorant with chisels and
crowbars ; and that the patient who pinned his
faith to the “ M.D.” on a brass plate was as likely
to be buried on the certificate of a dog-fancier as
on that of a qualified practitioner. Mr. Creed used
considerable language in dealing with this aggres-
sive tribe of pillmongers, and the Attorney-
General retaliated by laying down one of the
great axioms of Freetrade :
The public had a light to employ, in matters of medicine
and surgery, anyone whom they saw fit to call upon, and he
could not help pointing out that there were legally qualified
medical practitioners in our midst who assumed to them-
selves titles and degrees which they had no right to assume.
The point was cleverly taken, but it was a dismal
shuffle at the best. The public have a right “ in
matters of medicine and surgery”—and in matters
of law as well—to employ whomsoever they
please; they have a right to engage a policeman
or a Domain loafer to plead for them in the
Supreme Court, though, thanks to Attorney-
Genefal Simpson and his brethren, they are
meanly and unjustly defrauded of their privilege
in this matter, and they have the same inalienable
right to be doctored and operated upon by a book-
canvasser if they prefer him to a physician or a
surgeon. But the point at issue is of an entirely
different nature. What the public object to is
that they have no opportunity of distinguishing
the loafer and the book-canvasser from the
physician; that the trio are equally allowed
to use titles which set forth that they
have passed as duly qualified in their pro-
fession, and that when they send for a
doctor and are deceived by an ignorant amateur
who resembles the things sent for in nothing save
his bill, the law affords them no adequate redress
for an imposition which often leads to fatal re-
sults. If a law were passed which compelled
•every man practising medicine to describe himself
by his real style and title the public might, no
doubt, be permitted to retain the right on which
Attorney-General Simpson lays such stress; if
the broken-down adventurer were required to
describe himself as an “ amateur physician,” and
the Bachelor of Medicine who adopts the loftier
style of “ Doctor,” as so many even of the leading
practitioners of New South Wales do, were re-
quired to use only the title which he has fairly
•earned, and if the criminal code punished imposi-
tion instead of attempting to punish quackery,
then the people mLfht fairly and reasonably be
Heft to take care of themselves. But while the
Parkks Government, in its natural follow-feel-
ing for quacks, political aid other,”declines to
interfere, and while Attorney-Gent ral Simpson
continues to sit like an avalanche on the sham
Sawj er, but holds a brief for the sham doctor and
the surgical impostor, the public have a just right
to complain of the authorities as aiders and
•abettors of swindling and fraud. The doctor who
trades under a false designation is a confidence
anan of the meanest type—a type meaner even
than the card-sharper, for the doctor takes a
'low advantage of the sick who are not fitted to
•stand it, while the card-sharper trades chiefly upon
the able-bodied male citizen—and not even the
support and oountenance of Mr. Simpson cm ele-
vate him to any higher level. In fact, it becomes
an open question whether Mr. Simpson and his
“ protected ” brethren may not shortly require
•elevating themselves.
More Convicts for Australia.
The everlasting hills have long served as a by-
word for everything that is immoveable and un-
changeable on earth, but the metaphor is fast
becoming worn out. The world has found some-
thing compared to which even the hills are shift-
ing and transitory, and the granite peaks have
had their day as the symbol of passive resistance
to the attacks of external forces. The brain of the
British Tory is an older fossil than the mountain
ranges of Caucasus or Lebanon, and his ignorance
and stupidity are more deeply rooted than the
foundations of the globe itself. He takes no
account of the flight of time or the advance of
intellect; he still speaks of Australia or Canada
as a British “ possession ” as he did in the dark
dajs when no man was allowed by law to own
even himself except by the grace of his superiors;
and in his crab-like progress backwards he even
talks of a time close at hand when England may
resume the hideous system of transportation, and
shoot human rubbish into Australia as she did in
the barbarous past. Only last week the Illus-
trated London News, a presumedly sane organ
of British “ Liberalism,” devoted an article to this
subject, and solemnly propounded a scheme for
flooding Western Australia with cast-off pick-
pockets, with burglars, homicides, forgers, and
all the accumulated scu n of Britain’s decaying
civilisation, and expatiated on the advantages of
the system in these words: —
As at Botany Bay, the convict settlement would soon be-
come a respectable settlement—much sooner than at Botany
Bay, indeed, because it would consist of free men earning
their own liviDg ; and, in this great empty world, the trans-
portation to any one place need not continue for any very
long period of time.
The convicts, it will be observed, are not to be
confined. They are simply to be sent out to Western
Australia and turned loose for the term of their
sentences, to commit more homicides, more burg-
laries, more forgeries, to perpetrate more violence,
and to mix with the colonists and found a ne w
race of eriminals in anew land. The prospect is
inviting enough, and the reasons for the adoption
of this policy are set forth in words that are
suited to the meanest comprehension
Indeed,, it is notoriously not the worat class which starves—
the criminals, the burglars, the thieves —any more than it is
the best which is furthest from starvation, or makes most
money. Emigration is the removal of producers and the re-
tention of non-produeers.
Hitherto England has sent out thousands of her
starving agricultural labourers and mechanics to
Australia, and has left the New World to find
them homes and employment, to support those
who were past work, and to care for those who
were incurably sick. Many of them were old,
broken-down, and feeble 4 many were taken direct
from poor-houses and lunatic asylums ; they were
part of the vast horde for whom she could
find neither bread nor shelter, and their one
recommendation was that they did not openly
belong to the criminal classes. Some of them
lacked even this qualification, for London is filled
with charitable organisations which ship off dis-
charged prisoners of all degrees of criminality to
the Antipodes, and public and private enterprise
has done its best to fill Australia with the gar-
bage of the beloved mother land. But the Lon-
don News objects on the ground that the crowds
thus disposed off were not all scum, and urges
that England should send out its non-producers
only to prey upon the colonists, and keep her pro-
ducers entirely to herself. And the way in which
she proposes to do it is thus explained—
There are vast tracts of country, belonging to the United
Kingdom, which are still practically uninhabited : take,
merely as an example, Western Australia, with nearly a
million of square miles, a healthy climate, and (in 1881)
30,000 inhabitants, or less than one person to every 30 square
miles ; indeed, in four-fifths of this vast country there are no
inhabitants at all, as all the 30,000 live in the remaining fifth.
It should thus be long before there were residents to com-
plain of the forcing upon them of convicts.
The noble Britisher has yet to learn that neither
Australia nor the Australians “ belong ” to any
Power outside this Continent ; the days when one
man belonged to another are past. And as to the
theory that it would be long before any one would
complain of the re-establishment of British con-
victism in the Pacific, it all depends upon how the
writer measures the flight of time. In our own
opinion, it would be about two hours before every
colonist had entered his protest, and about three
before the first ship-load of criminals were driven
into the sea These figures, of course, are to
some extent based on mere guesswork, but they
can easily be verified. Let the genius who runs the
Illustrated London News look into history and
find out how long it has taken to accomplish the
promptest revolution on record, and he will have
his answ^r.
What eternal tommy-rot all the papers talk about
the results of Australian independence. Hark to
the “ Radical ” Age :
An independent Australia would mean an Australia that
would have to accept all the responsibilities of independence,
and amoDg other things to fight its own battles and protect
itself against any foreign foes whom it 3 diplomatists have
been unable to conciliate.
America might have said as much after she had
won her independence, and she had no more men
than we have and not half our resources. Moreover
she had England to the North of her in Canada and
Spain to the South of her in Cuba and Mexico,
whereas we have no hostile nation at all to fare
And yet America has pulled through somehow,
though she had to fight England, Mexico, and her
own Britishized South as well.

The following cable is not without interest, taken
in connection with something else :
A bill was introduced in the Reichstag to-day, the object
of which is the adoption of rigorous measures against the
Socialist agitators. The bill empowers the Government to
expatriate all avowed Socialists, and deprive them of their
rights as oitizens of the German Empire.
The something else is the speech of Prince Wil-
liam, the eldest son of the Crown Prince, in
which he recommends the State support of Ger-
man Salvation Army missions to the Berlin poor.
“ What we want, in order to eliminate Socialism
and discontent,” he says, “ is more Christianity /”
Yes, you want to make the people you have plun-
dered and degraded believe that they will go to
hell if they try to stop your living cn them ; that’s
clear enough, your Highness. It is not so many
j ears ago since your Highness could be seen five
nights out of the seven reeling round with
drunken women in Berlin or Bonn, and Laving a
‘ ‘ good time ” smashing looking-glasses and win-
dow-panes. Imagine this brutal young cut-
throat getting up now and calling out for
“ more Christianity ” for the masses ! The Reich-
stag has flung out the bill, the Berlin masses will
fling out the greasy superstition.

One of the saddest mistakes of that eminent
bungler, Parkes, was committed when he removed
Inglis from the quiet contemplation of his tea-
chests to make him Minister of Public Instruction
in New South Wales, and if the eminent tea-
dealer wishes to do the only good service he is
ever likely to render to his country he will resign
his billet and go back to the jungle, where, in
happier days, he used to hang on to the tail of the
raging tiger in his lair. When he assumed office,
Inglis professed fathomless sympathy with the
teaching profession, and proceeded to emphasise
his good wishes by docking the shivering school-
children of their firewood and lea vie g each
teacher to be his own charwoman. He also
abolished the system by which teachers were
granted free passes to their homes during the
holidays, and made much row over these various
economies. Inglis, however, is never happy un-
less he is composing a “minit” for the purpose
of enacting something, or abolishing something,
or standing something else on its head, and he has
now issued his tiger-slaying ukase to the effeeb that
the highest-paid teachers (those in Class A)
who are least in want of charity, shall be per-
mitted on certain easy conditions to travel free all
over New South Wales, while the poor members
of the profession must pay ordinary fares. The
bush-teacher who swelters out in the back blocks
on £0 a month with a deduction off that for the
superannuation-fund, must travel home to recruit
at his own expense or else stay and swelter where
he is ; the pupil-teacher who does all the work at
from 103. to 17s. 6d. a week —less his contribution
to the superannuation-fund—while the highly-
paid head-master is playing billiards, must also
pay as he goes or else give up all idea of going ; but
the boss instructor, with £4OO a year and
assistants to hoist the heavy end of the log,
can travel where he likes at the cost
of the taxpayers. This is the latest aspect of
Tige" I glis’ retrenchment, and serves as
another exposition of the sj stem by which the
schools are left dirty and fire less in order to raise
funds for Centennial banquets, fireworks, and
statues. Magnificence and dirt are strangely
mingled in Parkes’ policy, and under his moral
administration the times are better for the fat
hog and worse for the lean one than under any of
the common sinners who preceded him. And
while times are passing good for the fat hog they
are absolutely glorious for the fattest hog of all.

Representative “ad.” from the S.M. Herald
A. YOUNG man, c f good education, and who writes a
go : d hand, is desi»ous of employment; would like
to get mto a wholesale hous a or on a journal. C.,
2 Clare-terrace, Abercrombie, Golden Grove,
This yearner after the fourth estate has sized up
modern journalism pretty accurately —probably
through an extended acquaintance with the
Sydney dailies, and he reckons that a newspaper
is so much like a wholesale softgoods warehouse
that he will fit either job. The warehouse is a
place where they keep goods to suit the demands
of their customers, and the newspaper is a thing
which keeps opinions to suit its customers —the
warehousemen who advertise in it. At present the
Sydney Press is getting out its new autumn
opinions, and a large stock of left-off theories will
be cleaned out at a great sacrifice. Mr. “C.,”
of Clare-terrace, has, we repeat, a level head. He
knows that the Calico Jemmies who see his ad-
vertisement will be able to get him a job at
writing up public opinion in one of their news-
paper-warehouses if they have no imported
shoddy for him to vend at the other places.
Poor, old, played-out, antediluvian John Bright
writes to a friend in New Zealand :
Ignorance and selfishness are in partnership in the defence
of what is called Protection, after 40 years of Preetrade with
prodigious success.
That “ ignorance and selfishness ” comes grandly
from a manufacturer wfco made his own pile by
running hundreds of “ hands ” at competition
wages in order to fores Brummagem goods on to
the miserable Hindoos whose manufacturers and
artizans he had ruined ; but who save a man in
his dotage could prate of “ the prodigious suc-
cess” of which Great Britain is the present spec-
tacle ? Ireland just held down by straining every
nerve of two armies of occupation—London the
same —the Western Highlands the same—men and
wowen and children starving to death all over the
country—there’s “freetrade and prodigious suc-
cess for you I ” The venerable driveller closes up
with :
I hope you will follow the course of the old country and
New South Wales, which I am sure is following a course of
real prosperity and wisdom.
y' Follow the course of the old country and New
South Wales!" No, John ! We have been in
England and know that it is a hell upon earth for
nine-hundred and ninety-nine men and women out
of a thousand. Were John Bright a land-
nationaliser we could listen to him with respect on
the subject of Freetrade, but he isn’t, nor are any
of the Australian Freetrade party. They are
Freetraders, those of them who understand the
question, just as all the Cobdenites are Free-
traders : they want to cheapen food in order to
reduce wages.
+
Now that all mechanical means have failed and
those who in New South Wales suffer from the
terrible infliction of the rabbit-pest are awaken-
ing to the fact that the only effectual method of
fighting the scourge is by the use of some minor
form of germ disease, a healthy trade is being
done in the rearing and distribution of invalid
and valetudinarian bunnies. As much as £SO for
a single diseased rabbit "has been given, and
several people are making a specialty of this new
Freetrade industry. These inoculated rodents
will probably cause a deal of trouble, and the
danger to stock and no less to human life cannot
be foreseen. For at present the work of exter-
mination by disease, instead of being conducted
under the observation of experts, is blindly car-
ried on by inexperienced and unscientific indivi-
duals who are nece sarily ignorant of the ultimate
consequences of their action. Dr. Creed, M.L.C.,
who has taken an energetic part in the proposal to
remove rabbits by a low form of epidemic, and,
in fact, was the first to f>‘ ass it in New South
Wales, suggested to vernment the desir-
ableness of conductify Vyies of careful experi-
ments under the BUT n of a special com-
mission consisting of a. pathologist, chosen
by the Council of the Lor.don College of Phy-
sicians, a veterinary surgeon, selected by the
London Veterinary College, a pupil of Pastecr’s,
nominated by the great savant, and, in addition, a
gentleman trained in the German school, who has
made a special study of germ diseases, recom-
mended by Professors Virchow and Koch, of
Berlin. Thus both the great schools of germ-
disease inquiry would be represented, each repre-
sentative acting as a check upon any possible
rashness in the suggestions of the ether, while the
safety of human beings and domestic animals
would be thoroughly conserved by the other mem-
bers ol the Board. However averse the
Government may te to the tmplojment of
germ-diseases for the extirpation of rabbits,
germ diseases will continue to be used, either
openly if unforbidden or surreptitiously if prohi-
bited. The Government must take prompt action,
and Dr. Creed’s proposal has the recommenda-
tion of being some thousands of pounds per annum
cheaper than the present altogether ineffectual
system of dealing with the rabbit-pest, while it
certainly appears tremendously more drastic and
scientific. In connection with the question of
rabbit-destruction it seeni3 somewhat appropriate
to remark that Pasteur’s letter on the subject., for-
warded to Mr. Twenty-five-pound 3 bigail some
time ago, after being for months unheard of—pro-
bably shelved in the private-life of a pigeon-hole
—was reported in the Sydney daily Press as
“ undergoing the process of translation by the
Department.”

Mr. Abbott, P.M., of Sydney, is reported by the
local News to have publicly stated that the
Chinese are a frugal, hard-working race, and
that in the course of a long experience he has
only fined two Celestials for being drunk, whereas
he has treated two or three thousand Irish for the
same complaint. This is a really good argumen-
for the appointment of Chinese as Crown Proset
cutors and Police Magistrates. A lot of these
officers are notoriously fond of drink, and it is
evidently time they were dismissed and Mongols
with wooden countenances and habits of strict
sobriety put up to reign in their stead. After all,
however, respectability does not consist entirely
in keeping away from the beer when there is a
head on it, any more than honour consists in pay-
ing 20s in the £. Pa ekes effectually squashed
the latter delusion, and we proceed to sit on the
former in spite of Stipendiary Abbott and all his
tribe.

HISTORY Of BOTANY BAY.
The moment Bligh landed, Macarthar
made an attempt t j secure his ioflaence. He tells
the story himself. He says he wanted to interest
the Governor in the sheep and cattle question, on
the ground of the public good of the colony. But
Bligh had heard of Mr. Macarthur, and he saw
through the cunning device at a glance. His high
temper found vent, and this was certainly a fair
opportunity for its exercise. He saw that Mac-
Arthur’s wily pourparlers had as much benevo-
lence behind them as his proposal to relieve the
Government stores of the maintenance of a num-
ber of convicts by paying them bread-rate for
their labour, and the bluff seaman naturally re-
volted at the knavery. “ What have Ito do with
your sheep, sir f” he bawled at the disappointed
schemer. “ What have Ito do with your cattle ?
Are you to have such flocks of sheep and herds of
cattle as no man ever heard of before ? No, sir 1’
“ I endeavoured,” says Macarthur, with innocuous
mildness, “to appease him, saying t&at I under-
stood the Government at home had particularly
re'ommended me to his nolic?. He replied, * I
have heard of your concerns, sir ; ycu have got
5000 acres of land in the finest situation in the
country, bub, by ———, you Bhan’t keep it! "
This is Macarthur's own version of what took
place, yet it shows how accurately Bligh s rough
honesty had seised itself of the position. But
Macarthur did keep the land—to have and to hold
by him and his heirs forever.
• * *
Bllgh’s instructions were to stop the traffic
in rum within the colony by every means in his
power. They are dated May 25, 1805, under the
sign-manual, from St. James’, and they enlarge on
the “ great evils that have arisen from the un-
restrained importation of spirits.” He was en-
joined “ on pain of our utmost displeasure ” to
allow no spirits to land without his consent and
to stop the exchange of rum for daily neces-
saries. He arrived in 1806, and early next year
he issued a General Order, threatening 100 lashes
to any convict and three months’ imprisonment
and a £2O fine to any settler who bartered rum for
food or clothing. Lord Castleraagh expressly ap-
proved of these measures, and conveyed to Bligh
the expression of the royal approbation. Another
matter in which Bligh earned the Minister's
thanks was his action in relieving serious dis-
tresses caused in the Hawkesbury district by the
floods of 1806. Provisions reached exorbitant
prices, coarse meal and flour being half-a-orown
per pound and the two-pound leaf selling at 5».
Bligh personally visited the breadless homes,
slaughtered the Government cattle, and
divided them among the starving people,
and encouraged them to set to work
again by offering fair prices for the crops they
m'ghto grow. He saw that the results of the
settlers’ labour were minimised by the fact that
the officers who ruled the market charged ruinous
rates of exchange for what they had to sell. He
therefore opened the King's Stores at Sydney i o
the settlers, and supplied them with whab they
required, to be paid for in produce at the follow-
ing harvesb. The eetbJers began to hope that a
new state of things was about to rale in the
colony ; but the New South Wales Corps had to
be reckoned with yet.
* * *
It soon became apparent to Bligh that the
task of reform in the settlement would be met at
every stage by the interests of the officers. Their
rascally trade would be interfered with by every
measure the Governor might take to make the
settlers’ lot more easy. Their inflaenoe was
great, for they had the power of the Corps ab
their back. The rank-and-file shared the insolence
of their officers, and Bligh soon found moral and
material progress entirely blocked by this fine
body of men. He wrote home in 1807 with a
complaint to this effect, and added, ‘‘About 70 of
the privates were originally convicts, and the
whole are eo very muoh engrafted with that order
of persons, as in many instances have
had a very evil tendenoy, and, it is to
be feared, may hereafter lead to serious conse-
quences, more particularly from their improper
connection with the women.” This is not as lucid
as it is true, but then none of the early Governors
were selected for the purity with which they
expressed themselves in their mother-tongue.
Bligh weab on to say that there was no remedy
“ but a change of military duty, a circumstance
which can only prevent a fixed corps becoming a
dangerous militia.” If Bligh had hem deposed for
his feloniously bad English, there is ample justifi-
cation here ; but the reason was a more practical
one than that.
* * *
To prohibit the importation of rum was
easy, but the officers were not so docile as to allow
a step like that to interfere with their dishonest
fortunes. It was one thing to shut rum out of
the colony, and quite another thing to keep people
from making it within. The officers imported
stills, and the last state of the rum traffic became
worse than the first High forbade the distilla-
tion of spirits, and when two stills arrived in 1807
in the Dart, one being for Captain Abbott and one
for John Macarthur, the Governor impounded
them ia the King's store. But the boilers had
been artfully packed full cf medicine, and they
were therefore sent to Macarthur’s place. This
occurred in March. In October a ship wa l going
horns, and Bligh directed that the stills be put on
board and taken back whence they came. Robert
Campbell, who was the naval officer, made the
demand, and Macarthur replied, saying that he
had nothing to do with Abbott’s still, and he vas
going to sell his own to some ship going to China.
The Governor ordered the stills to be sent to Eog-
land at once, Macarthur then cavilled about the
receipt, and told the nephew of the harbour-
master to take the stiffs at his own risk. He took
proceedings against the officer who effected the
seizure, and complained that a British subjeot, in a
British settlement, under British laws, had had his
property wrested from him on the Governor's
order. He defended the rights of property, and
its privilege to make and to sell rum—for the
boilers were certainly intended to serve as
mere medicine-chests—with a fi r e indignation and
lofty scorn,
• * #
In the course of the following month a
convict escaped by one of Maoarthur s ships. The
owner forfeited a £9OO bond. Macarthur ap-
pealed to the Governor, who deolined to set aside
the Court’s decision. Payment was refused,
whereupon the ship was seized, and the officers
soon found out that they had a firmer man to deal
withthanKing, or Hunter, orPhilliphad been. Mac-
arthur sent the crew on shore, contrary to colonial
regulations. The Judge Advocate summoned
Macarthur to answer in the case, and he declined
to obey the summons. A warrant was issued for
his arrest, and the Parramatta constable, Oakes,
was charged with its execution. This honest
man had been sent out as a missionary to the
South Seas, but his spiritual ministrations were
not favourably received by the natives of Tahiti,
so they chased him away, and he became the
jjclice-constable at Parramatta ; catching souls or
bodies was all one to Mr. Oakes, He presented
Maoarthur with the warrant “ with many humble
a, ologies Macarthur chased him again, telling
him if he oame any more to come armed, and that if
the person who issued the warrant had come—prob-
ably meaning His Honor the Judge- Advocate—he
would have “spurned him from his presence."
Then he spumed the constable just as the
Tahitians had spurned him before, and gave him
a little note to Mr. Atkins saying that he regarded
his warrant with soorn and contempt, as well as
the persons who directed it to be executed. Oakes
saw the Governor and the Judge-Advocate in
to wn next morning. They spurned him once more,
and sent him back to arrest Macarthur, and lodge
him in gaol. So the chief constable of Sydney
and Mr. Oakes, with three other const >bles who
had not been missionaries, went afcer Mr. Mac-
arthur with cutlasses, arrested him at a friend’s
house in Sydney, and spurned him into prison.
* * •
He was committed for trial next day, but
liberated on bail This was December 17. On
January 25 following, the Criminal Court met,
consisting of the Judge-Advocate and six officers
of the Corps. The of Users had laid their plans in
the meantime. The Court was crowded with their
men, wearing side arms. A convict attorney
named Crcssley prepared the indictment, as the
Judge-Advocate’s legal knowledge did not extend
beyond sentencing prisoners. A series of horrid
crimes and misdemeanours were charged against
Macarthur. As soon as the Court was constituted
tne defendant objected to the Judge-Advccite on.
grounds of personal enmity, bub that officer re
plied that, in tha terms of the King's Patent, there
could be no Court witho it him. Captain Kemp
told the Judge he was merely a common juryman,
and the officers compelled him to leave his seat as
president of the Court, while Vacarthur addressed
those assembled in a wild and excited manrer.
He said that Atkins had “ associated and com
blned with that well-known dismembered limb of
the law, George Crossley,” to accomplish his de-
struction. He added that he had proof in the
writing of Crossley that it was determined to ruin
him. “ This precious document,” he said, “ came
into my hands as if by the interposition of Divine
Providence ; it dropped from the pocket of
Crossley, and was brought to me.” Divine Pro-
vidence in this instance was probably the same
power that extracted the papers from Governor
King’s despatch-box—a clever pickpocket,
namely, of the class whose services the officers
had often occasion to use. The person who
pioked Crosfsley's papers up where ha so oppor-
tunely dropped them might just as well hava
picked his pockets of them at once, though it
might not have been so convenient for Macarthur
to have said so.
* * *
So the drunken Judge and the convict
atborney and the turnkey officers fought amongst
themselves, and tha reader to-day may judge, if
he can, what there is to choose among them.
When these squalid rascals fall out among them-
selves, we Bee what kind of creatures they really
are. When Macarthur finished his harangue, the
Judge-Advocate threatened to commit him, but
Captain Kemp shouted, “ You commit! No, sir, I
will commit you to gaol.” The Judge Advocate
then tried to adjourn the Court, and left, but
Captain Kemp insisted that the officers were a
Court. Macarthur claimed the protection of the
officers against his enemies. They gave him a
guard, and the Provost-Marehal, Mr Gore, very
properly treated their action a 3 a rescue, and
obtained a warrant for his arrest. The officers
wrote to the Governor, demanding that Atkins
should be replaced by another judge, to which
Bligh replied that it was out of his power to super-
sede the King's Commission. 1 The officers repeated
their request, and Bligh asked for the papers.
Theyrefneed to them. Then the Governor

under particular pflent t - mmsbances. Hereplied,
and said thab he wj owes TH \ill to come,” an 4 was
unable to write. intergsM morning, January 2G,
the Provost arrested Macarthur again, and the
Judge Advocate formally accused the officers to
the Governor, of “ crim s amounting to usurpa-
tion,” and tending to incite rebellion and treason
in the territory B.igh summoned the officers to
appear before him next day, and again summoned
Major Johnstone, and again received a reply saying
that the Major was still “so ill ar» to be unable to
write.” Bub he was not too ill to drive the same
afternoon into Sydney to his barracks, where the
officers met him, and rerauaded him to usurp the
government of the colony. Th 9 New South
Wale 3 Corps formed, and, with drums beating
and colours flying, marched up:n Government
House.
The following, cub from Mr. A. W. Stir-
ling’s book “The Never Never Land, ’ published a
few years ago in London, refers to Mr. Wi liam
Pritchard Morgan, the Queenslander who has
caused such a sensation in Great Britain by his
alleged extensive gold discoveries in Wales
“Among the characters of Queensland, well
known from Sydney in the South to Cooktown
or Thursday Island in the North, was a solicitor,
at the time of my Australian trip, practising his
profession at Charters To vrera, whenever he was
not more profitably occupied in amusing his
friends with a song or a story, or, better still, in-
vesting his hard-earned money in some reef which
was sure to dra v a blank. To this gentleman I
had a letter of introduction from a friend now
dead, and to his kindness and hospitality I am
greatly indebted for my pleasant visits to Char-
ters Towers.
“ One often meets strange mixtures of genius,
wit, and recklessness, in wandering about the
world, but M—— was the strangest, the most
amusing, and the most daring I ever saw. He
would work for a week to earn a couple of hun-
dred pounds, and invest the whole of it in the
first mine that anybody recommended the next
day. He would say the smartest things on the
spur of the moment, yet was incapable of remem-
bering the names of the mines he was interested
in. He could hob-nob with a host of working
miners on terms of tho closest friendship in the
afternoon, and come to a select party of ladies
like a ‘ man to bhe manner born,’ in the evening.
M was tha very George Lewis of Queensland.
No criminal who could afford the luxury would
ever have dreamt of being defended by any other
man in the North of the colony ; if a coach and
four could be driven through an Acb of Parlia-
ment, M was the man to do the deed ; if a
man was wanted to make a social evening amus-
ing, M had no rival.
MR, W. PRITCHARD-MORGAN.
“ As he used to say, with a smile, mining owed
him £20,000, and there was every proba-
bility of that sum being doubled if he only lived
long enough. Everyone at Charters Towers, in-
cluding M* hlmseß, has some amusing story
to tell about the little man, One of the best came
t ) me from an insurance-agent, who had to collect
M 's premium
‘ ‘ This was, of course, always behind time, and
only extracted with great difficulty and much
grumbling. On one occasion, afeer four or five
unsuccessful applications, my friend, the agent,
was astonished one morning very early by the
advent of M ’s clerk in a great hurry, with a
cheque for the money due. Of a truth, thought
the agent, the world must be coming to an end,
when M is in such a hurry to pay his debt®.
He took the money, however, and walked up the
street to tell the extraordinary news to an Ac-
quaintance, only to learn that M was sup-
posed to be dying, having been taken suddenly
iil in the night. On my chaffing M about this
story, ha laughed, and said that as soon as he
came to himself in (he morning his first thought
had been about his life policies, and that he had
better pay up the premiums before the news of his
idness got about. He, therefore, dispatched tha
clerk with a cheque, and seemed very hurt that
the money had been so badly spent; indeed, his
recovery is to tMs day one of his grievances.
“I remember, too, a not unamusing ‘yarn’
which M toils about a Queensland judge, now
dead, who numbered among hia other amiable
weaknesses, the not uncommon failing among
judges of prosing over his own hobbles.
* ‘ M was conducting a case for a client, and
in the course of his duty, placed a witness in the
box whose name was ‘ Inch.’ The judge caught
the name as ‘ Inc?,’ and at once wandered off into
a long story about a family he had known in Eng-
land cf that name, and congratulated the witness
upon being probably connected with such a good
old stock.
“ Poor M , who saw the mistake, in vain
tried to stop the old man's torrent of eloquence,
and several times interrupted him wi h * No, your
Honor, the witness’s name is ‘ Inch,’ without
producing the desired effect. At last, in despera-
tion, he spelt the name, ‘I N-C-H—lnch,’ and at
length it dawned upon the poor judge that he had
beenmaklngafoolof himself. He wasnot,however,
to be easily upset, but with a faoe ot the utmost dis-
gust exclaimed : * Inch I What! Twelve of them
to a foot! Let the witness step down,’ and, despite
all M 's remonstrances, nothing could induce
the old man (30 M says) to listen to another
word the witness had to say.’’

director of a pawnshop which grinds the faces of
the poor, and coins gold from the blood of a hard-
up drayman, by lending him money at 130 per
cent, on readily-convertible security ?
J. W. Abigail, of Newtown, remarks in
the Sydney D T. that “it is useless to quarrel with
the inevitable, and we must be satisfied with
things as they ara.” This, we may observe, is
the sort of philosophy with which the usurer
always comforts the cl'ent whom he has had on
toast for a hundred and shixty per shent.
The N.S.W. Freetraders profess a desire
for intercolonial Freetrade. That, it must be ad-
mitted by everyone, can only be brought about
when the fiscal sjstems of the colonies shall have
been closely assimilated. And this assimilation
must be effected on a Protectionist and nob upon a
Freetrade basis. That Freetrade is doomed in
N.S.W. must be obvious to even the meanest in-
telligence. A cause, like an individual, grows
stronger or weaker, fatter or thinner, as tte years
roll on, Freetrade has got thin in every country
in the world bat England. It bas grown poor and
weak in all the Australian colonics, inclnding its
last stronghold, N.S.W. A few years ago, there
were but two Protectionists in the N. S. W. Legis-
lative Assembly ; a year or two later there were
seveD, in another year or two there were 20, and
in still another year or two there were 40, who
are there now. If the electors of Newtown want
to be on the gaining side, let them vote for Smith,
and strike out Mitchell.

The Statue.
(BY HENRY HALLORAN, C.M.G.)
[From an Ode on the occasion of laying the
Foundation-stone of the Statue of the Queen.]
Here where Her Royal Consort's Statue stands,
Above the passing throng
All the day long,
UtteriDg His mild commands :
Here, where the multitude,
On festal days,
Rooks up and says,
“ Albert the Good,”
And each in spirit prays—
Good is to be Great;
Such be my child, O God, whatever be my fate,"
Here place we now
The we ided statue to complete the scene;
Here, ere we bow
Within each neighbouring shrine,
Place we our Queen;
And each in silence vow
'» R, B £,G°d to se>ve, for Her God shall be mine,
And Sne my Queen."
If in our hearts we hold
Her stainless image—need we this to tell
Of what we all hold dear?
But should our hearis grow cold,
la some remoter year—
Or if they should rebel,
What dread reproach should we not gaxe on here
How ga zb and be untrue—
How owe nor pay as due ?
Then set it up on high, my friends, on high,
And let each passer-by
Say to himself, in journeying on his way,
It was a blessed day
When She, Victoria, in her maiden pride,
Came to hold sway
Over Her mighty Empire free and wide; ”
So Heavea guard Her still;
Heaven guide her righteous will;
For this, do we and all Her subjects pray !
Then one cheer more,
Till oyer sea and shore
The distant echoes fide and pass away.
THAT IMAGE.
(THE BULLETIN VERSION.)
Here where the fctrtua of the Gorman,
That very henpecked prince,
Defunct lorg since,
Preaches his silent sermon ;
Here where the careless crowd
Who lonnge and smoke
Say, “ Poor old bloke !
He’s in his shroud,”
And cut some ribald joke
About the weary life
That, rumour says, he lived with his illustrious
wife -
Here we've put the Queen,
Who married him for better or for wor e ;
These two between
Rough-handed labouring chaps
Pause, just to curse
All cringing flunkies mean—
Then turn away to breathe a prayer, perhaps,
For The Bcllyteen.
If we hold Freedom dear
We scorn this image ; there the thing re mains—
A Tory token to remind
That we have cause to fear
T he traitors who’ve designed
To tighter draw our chainp.
What dread reproach do we not gaze on herb
Would people really tree
Stand statues of Queen Y. ?
So, let each passer-by of this big, bror '/M lie
Say, “ Gammon ! All my eye !
The world has grown wiser sincj tho day
When Vicky, young and gay,
Deposited a crown upon her head
And foals cried ‘ Hooray 1 ’
For soon we’ll set up Liberty instead;
Then Albert and the Queen
Will vanish from the scene ;
For this do we end all Australians pray,
Though images like these
Please drivelling C.M.G.’s,
We’ll live to sse both carted clean away.”

There’s a burst of airy music at the gay Criterion,
Where the oritlcs are all sitting upon young
“ Dick Whittington ; ”
'Tis a tale of deep devotion shown in new fantastic
lights,
And illumined by the presence of an emperor in
tights.
He has f»thornless designs upon a maiden dressed
in blue,
Who is kidnapped in a mud-barge by a wild, vin-
dictive crew,
And who mourns her melancholy fate in poetry's
airy flights,
Which move the scornful laughter of the monarch
clad in tights.
Her lover, too, along with her, in chains is dragged
away
Through the scheming of an admiral with morals
gone astray—
A Terror of the Seas who bears the scars of fifty
fights,
Through which he’s borne the banner of the
potentate in tights.
At times the songs are shipwreoked on the high
tumultous C,
And the founde-ed bark of rythm is lost on the
waves of melody,
And the opera to.ters as ib strives to scale weird
Fancy's heights,
But still it’s shored up grimly by the emperor in
tights.
The rovers of the ocean are profane, to say the
leaßfc,
Their path is strewn with carcases of gentlemen
deceased,
Arut their song 3 are like the croaking of the car-
rion crows and kites
When they sing in dismal chorus to the despot
clad in tights.
The admiral’s a comic man, the funniesb of the
crew;
He is shorb and grim and tragic, and his nose is
purple-blue;
His head is red, his bilious eye with awful frenzy
lights,
And he treats with sags and insolence the buc-
caneer in tights.
The ladles are as beautiful as any gills you’ll see,
Though the melodies they warble are as common
as oan be,
And the scenery is fairy-land all Etrewn with
fairy lights
Which reflect the dismal visage of the emperor in
tights.
Emma Temple, Fanny Robina, and several ladies
more
Are harasEed by a fiend who wants to wallow in
their gore ;
Bub we rise to move, in deference to Beauty’s
sacred rights,
That he should tread instead upon that sovereign
in tights.
For though Brough and Royce are wanted in this
world of care and woe,
We can spare this precious opera, and be glad to
see it go;
And the Hottentot who wrote it, if he other
screeds indites,
Will please leave oub for evermore that potentate
in tights.

Saturday’s sensation at Sydney Academy
was a conundrum which one cf the sable warriors
dashed off in a moment of inspiration : “ What is
the difference,” he asked, “between an amateur
eka'er and Jack M Eihone ?” Then he waited till
the audience had slmmerei up to an awful pitch
of expectancy, and when the excitement had
almost reached the point when an insurrection
might be looked for, he explained : “ Because one
skates and falls, while ihe other skites and bawls.”
We ara of opinion that the honourable member
has scope here for a libel action, which will
cripple the whole Federal Bhow in damages.

Last Tuesday George Rignold reached his

into the premises next Friday, and lend the illu-
mination of his yawn. The beautiful “lolanthe ”
will be put on at the T oyal next Saturday, with
Maggie Mooie as the Fairy Queen and Leonora
Braham as Phyllis. “Faust’ is earning the ap-
plause and the coin it deserves at the Gaiety, and
Bhould have a long run in a c’.ty where people
don't believe much in perdition. Other entertain-
ments are comparatively dull. The aquariums
all keep up, and there is a scheme on foot for
raising a monument to Daniel Hinry Dlniehy. At
Coogee Mr. Smith undertakes to skate over 1G
chairs ; Mr. Eastwood is shortly to have a benefit
in “ Richelieu’’ at the Ar hen mum Hall, Waver ley,
and one or two men i ave had their legs cut off in
various parts of Sydney. A grand bicycle tourna-
ment for ladies comes off by electric light at the
Afchfield Recreation Grounds on Thursday, Fri-

drop off they will fall softly on to their back-hair.

A “ Centenary Universal Exhibition,”
which seems to be about as much behind the
times as an attempt to collect a bill from a dead
man, is to open in the Sydney Exhibition Build-
ing, Prince Alfred Park, on March 14. It will be
as universal as space will permit, and as cen-
tenary as the state of the calendar will allow.
Baron Smith-Carirgton will open the proceedings,
and the performance will also be adorned by the
white head cf Parkes, and countenanced by the
presence of almost every other public man who is
sufficiently s ibar to appear, together with some
“distinguished members of both Houses.” This
designation is comprehensive enough to include
every politician who hasn’t been recently licked
and used to wipe up the floor with. Two new an-
nexes are being built, and the premises will bo lit
with electrioity. Also, the Park will be illu-
minated twice a week, and there will be sundry
displays of fireworks to help an impecunious
public to forget the bills they owe.

“ Sophia” is still a source of great attrac-

season of seven months at Garner’s Theatre, an-

Charles Warner opened at Melbourne
Royal, on Saturday, and carried a packed audience
by storm. His Coupeau took their fancy when he
was sober, won their heart? as he became be-
BOtted with bad brandy, and finally died of D.T.
amid murmurs, shouts, and whistles of admira-
tion. To accomplish all i his in a repulsive, dis-
jointed, long-winded, stale, old sermon like
“Drink” was something to be proud of, but the
new star took bis triumph with an artistic modesty
worthy of notice. It is because of his likeable—
not to say loveable—style that Mr. Warner can
do so much with this same part of Coupeau, and
contrives to be an object of sympathy right away
through. Yet, so simple and commonplace ia bis
method of getting tight, that the weak wretch
never appears to ask for your pity, until the
awful mcment when he sees green alliga-
tors chasing blue tigers a’ong the kitchen
floor, and a swarm of magenta rats fasben
their teeth in his twitching flesh. Mr. Warner
used to be a great actor in his great part—now
he is rather greater than he used to be. And if
any man denies this sublime truth he can die in
his boots like Ananias. Bub “ Drink” isn't a
greater play than it used to be, not by any means,
rather let us say that it seemed less aggravating a
few years ago. The author might have white-
washed Zola’s novel without destroying its moral
in a stupid seventh act of his own manufacture,
or lugging in a temperance spouter. There is no
moral to “ Drink ” as it stands, except that a man
who signs the pledge is bound to die of the jumps,
leaving his starving widow to marry a cold-water
apostle in affluent circumstances. The boys in
the gallery and the old squatters
in the circle (also their ladies)
don't require a temperance-
lecture from Gouget while poor
Coupeau is touching them on
the raw ; but if the Trium-
virate will let an Accident In-
surance canvasser rush on and
take Coupeau's “risk,” after his
sawdusb dummy has fallen from
a scaffolding without getting
hurt, then they will confer a real;
benefit on the Australian work-
ing-man. George Darrell might
fix that idea into a drama and
get a heavy subsidy from an
Insurance Company. ’Tis a
valuable hint. There will be
further opportunity for saying
something nice about Misses
Isabel Morris, Watt-Tanner,
Emma Chambers, and other
members of a strong company
—also for suggesting that
Lautier had better be stabbed
in the liver (another outrage
on “ L’Assommoir ”) before the
play commences. The wash-
house hot wate*\ and scenery
generally, is excel ent, and
“Drink” will sell freely at the Royal for some
time to come. Bub it is too full of awful i ean-
ing to Euib many toaey patrons of the dress-circ'e,
who know all about the jim-jams without going
to the the-a-ter.

gether of humanity which is described as “ M r .
Holloway’s talented compaoy,” never scored a
point all night, and it was melancholy to see a

The Otago Witness (N.Z.) thinks that
one of the nastiest things goieg is to be a professor
of mesmerism, and to raise money by shoving
people into trances and then making them eat
candles and chew raw herrings on the stage. It
is of opinion that Professor Kennedy, who is now
doing these things in Melbourne, will shortly leave
the fctsge cn his head. A Wellington (N Z.) critic
says that ‘Uncle Tom’s CL bin,” as played by
Carrie Swain, is “ a cross between a variety show
and a circus, with a lot of darned cheek slung in."
The sort of man who writes this would probably
sit on Bacon (late Shakespeare) because ho dida’t

At an English theatre recently a dude threw a
bouquet at a favourite lady, and his cuff went
alorg with it. The bouquet fell at her feet, and
the cuff landed in her eye. It is doubtful if she
will ever see with that eye again. The Prince of
Wales has a gorgeous private smoking-room at the
new Empire Theatre in Leicester Square, Loti don,
and he comes in with a big cigar to watch the ballet.
Bisgreatfatherly heart yearns over the billet-girls.
An Amerioan paper states that John Rrgers, the
other fellow of Minnie Palmer, has caught a cold
which may possibly prove fabal. It attributes this
“ to his hanging about the doors of the theatres,
attired In a vest out much lower than the state of
the weather and decency required," We would
feel sorry for John Regers If we didn’t sus-
pect it was all an advertisement. Sir Graham
Berry is endeavouring to secure Strauss, the well-
known musician, to conduct the band at the

There was a young man at Sydney Royal the
other night who professed to be prematurely old
in the ways of the world, and he had along with
him a freshly-caught girl from Jamberoo, who
was obviously awed by his knowledge of the way
people went on in great cities. When Maggie
Moora - came on as Katisha he said loudly :
“ Here's Kelly, Loo—here’s ths Mikado.” His
subsequent downfall was pitiable. Charles
Warner’s real baptismal name Is said to be Lick-
fold. We often forget our name ourselves, and
have to go into a public-house to look at the mark
on our collar. Herr Bandmann, the star who
received bo much amiable derision in Australia,
is now rearing live stock in Montana (U.S). It is
lonely there, but still he has the society of the pigs.
Hawtrey has made £75,000 out of the “ Private
Secretary." This is a little more than he made at
Maryborough (Q.) when he was up there some
years ago. He bought the gates at a local race-
meeting for £lOO, and realised exactly £1 profit.
From this it will be seen that every man who
can't make money on a racecourse should go away
and write a comedy. A Sydney theatrical manager
was lecturing his chorus-girls the other day about
the gloomy, chief-mourner-like expression they
always wore, and, finding that they didn’t
brighten up worth a cent, he danced furiously on
his hat and screamed : “ Great Scott! 13 Caere
nothing on earth that can liven you up, you pack
of ghastly ghosts ? What would you do if I raised
your salaries ?" All the girls laughed at the idea
except one, who, in a still small voice, replied,
THE STRAIGHT TIP FOR NEWTOWN.
“ We’d drop dead, sir.” The rehearsal closed
abruptly. D’Aroy Stanfield and Co. are doing ex-

prostrate admirers with a gold bracelet as heavy
as a prayer-meeting, and the recherche Q’Arcy

There is a current impression among the
ignbrant public that a cavalry soldier in invari-
ably, as his n me implies, a mounted warrior ;
but in England, at all events, this isn’t necessarily
the case. Out of 18,000 alleged cavalry 6800 men
have n > ho sea, so that this branch of the service
is really divided into horse and foot cavalry, and
is fur her subdivided owing to the fact that some
of u e horse cavalry can't ride, and some of the
foot cavalry can, but don't get the chance. The
walking hussars who can’t ride are further divided
into those who know a horse when they see it and
those who don t, and the latter sub division con-
sists of two classes, viz , tho e who have seen
a horse but can’t remember what at is like,
and those who have never seen a horse, and who
migit possibly recognise the animal if they had a
vew o it The horse cavalry who can’t ride also
form two classes, th > first consisting of those who
are thrown off; and the second, and larger, class of
tho-e who can’t get on, while the division which
can ride is separated in o those who hold to the
front of the saddle and those who trast in Provi-
dence and only clutch at the tail in an emergency.
This last section is the one on which the country relies
in its hour of need, and when the troops charge
in the van of the battle, with the foot horsemen —
or pedestrian cavalry, as they might more properly
be called—running behind, it is time for the
enemy to skip, if he doesn’t want to be pulverised.

Baron Brasaey is still busy in London
giving points to the authorities on Australian
topics, and hi 3 name promises to be writ large in
the history of British lunatics. He still acknow-
ledges to having found “ traces ” of republican
feeling in the colonies, and in view of this rising
tide of disaffection he urges that the band of one
of tho regiments of the Guards should be sent
out to arouse a santiment of loyalty and to excite
feelings of attachment to the Empire. A man
who takes Brassey’s size in hats fcan’t comprehend
any national aggravation which wouldn't be
soothed by the sight of a few men in uniform
whopping the big dram and pounding the tom-
tom, and he is fully convinced that all Australia
wants is to be taken notice of by some of the poor
scum who wear coronets. He also thinks it would
bo advisable for a prince to come out occasionally
—any siz9 of a prince, for Brassey isn’t particular
aboutdetails —and ha recommends that “a colonial
body possossing Imperial functions’’ should be
formed in London, The duties of this boly without
a soul are not specified, but it would probably be a
very convenient institution for Salisbury, who
would only have to run round the corner any time
he wanted a treaty signed, Sundry other fat-
headed de Igns have been formulated by Bra3sey
for smooching the track of Imperialism ia the
colonies, but the bras 3 band, the occasional visit
from a princa, and the colonial body with Im-
perial functions, are the things which he regards
as more immediately essential. But the old piok-
and-shovel ba:on didn’a stay long enough in Aus-
tralia to feel the pulse of the people. If he had
he would have ascertained that the one thing
which this continent is yearning for is a cat-show
—a great international cat-show held under royal
auspices. Such a thing would do more to extin-
guish disaffection than even a brass band, and if
it could be combined In, some way with a scheme
for putting the church choirs in tights, the safety
of the Empire would be insured for many years to
come.

This story relates chiefly to a minister of
the Gospsl. His name doesn't matter to any
serious extent, and his aidrass isn’t of any
account, especially as he isn’t likely to be there
much longer, owing to circumstances which make
it advisable for him to go away, but it may bs
here set forth that he is a round, podgy, roley-
poley shepherd with a large face and a smile that
hangs down over his neck and extends roun 1 to
the back part of his bead. He has a church upon
a quiet spot by the saa shore, where the rolling
waves cast up sea-weed and old boots at the door
of the sanctuary, and whare the asphyxiated dog
rides upon the foaming breakers until they land
him • softly upon the yellow sand with his curly
tail all dishevelled and the bark whioh used to
echo in the back j ard of that poor worm called
man reduced to eternal silence. Amid these
romantio scenes the pastrr mused and labo ired
for many years Tho;e who were honour, d with
his acquaintance will probably remember having
seen upon the shore semathbg that resembled a
ham lost in thought, and those who were only
osaally known to him will also recollect him
because he was a man who if anyone saw him
once and wanted to meet him again but didn’t do
ib he wouldnt lose so much as he might have
imagined at tne time He answered this descrip-
tion more than any other man in the locality, and
consequently he can be easily known by it. In
his best days he was a pastor of the kis9ey-
kis-ey, squeezy-squeezy species, and ha dabbled a
good deal in medicine. One day last month a lady
who was spiritually birched to his flock was taken
ill through mortification at having subscribed to
tha Parkes Fund, and the little fat prophet called
to see her and inquired closely Into her symptoms.
Then ho said cheerfully that he coaid fix her at
once ; he would just go home and make up a
little prescription of his own which, under Pro-
vidence, would be ins rumental, &0., and a cure
would immediately ensue. So he went round to
the adjs cant chemist and told him to mix up a
little cht)»p stuff of some kind or other, and to put
ia something to give it a nice smell, and to add
anything that he thought mignt be suitable for a
lady who had been in bed t*o days, and if he had
sometoing or other about the p nca that people
were accustomed to take whan there wasn't any-
thing particular the matter with them or any
kind of thing that it might be as well to have in
the house in o re of anything happening he might
put it,in, too. It was the widest, most compre-
hensive order the chemist had ever received, but
he mixed up a little of everything that was handy
on the bottom shelf, and charged 33. 6d. for the
lot. Tha adipose howler took off the label when
he got outside, and when he returned to the bed-
side of his patient he told her how ho had dis-
covered this remarkable remedy, whioh was invalu-
able to every Christian household, and casting his
eyes piously up towards a fly on the ceiling, he said
that as a humble toiler in the vineyard, he would
only charge her 16s 6d, But, unhappily, the mixture
missed fire, and the chemist was hauled out in
the dead of night to look at a lady who was riot-
ing round in an awful state of discomfort, at one
moment knocking her head against the bedpost
and the next putting her feet out of the window
while she balanced herself on her hands upon the
floor, and then, in some new burst of derange-
ment, trying to lift the baby by the tail when she
might have know that it hadn't any. The case
was obviously a desperate one, and as the lady,
when questioned, only answered by screams, tin
distracted chemist treated her at random far
paralytic hydrophobia, a:d poured medicine
into her till at last she became calm. Whea
the sufferer had finally given up bounding across
the room and he had time to inquire into
the trouble, he was sho vn the bottle of
medicine, and then he explained how a podgy
maniac had called on him and asked him for a
little of everything, and how, being under the im-
pression that a secret care was preying on his
mind, and that) he wan ed to drown his conscience,
he had charged him 33. 6d. for a mixture which
would give him three months oblivion from his
sorrows in his efforts to get the taste out of his
mouth. When he learned, however, that a
minister of the Gospel had made 13a. out of the
transaction he rose np in wrath and said that the
man who would be guilty of such a sin was
capable of any iniquity and had traces of inoen-
diari-m and highway robbsry concealed beneath
histcalp. The matter was laid before the 15
deacons of the church, and these sultry Christians
have formally called upon the clergyman to re-
sign. So far he has refused, but the collections
have fallen off so much, and the boys of the
neighbourhood have begun to scra f ch matches on
the green paint of the church door and up3et ash-
barrels in the vestibule at such an awful ra e that
it is evident public opinion is against him, and he
will yet be compelled to skip.

ON THE MELBOURNE BLOCE.
Dear Bulletin, — The Catechism says that
the chief end of man is to glorify God, but here in
Melbourne, as of yore, the chief end of woman is
to do the Block, and she does it with the vigour
of a K.C.M.G. touting for subscriptions to the
Imperial Institute. Home life is increasingly at a
discount, and the climate is so glorious that it
tempts people to go out at all times of the day. A
Melbourne wiuter is merely summer with his
overcoat on. The summer is so delightfully
mosaiced with oold days that we have scarcely
time to say “ how hot it is ’’ before the weather
has changed to delicious coolness. The climate is
too variable sometimes —you would think so to
soe the crisp cotton-dresses of girl-blockaders
turned into dripping rags in less than an hour.
A oolonial litterateur once proposed in one of his
tales the importation of banshees and other
ancient relic 3. for the benefit cf the many rich
people who have nothing to do, and are for suffi-
cient reasons unable to spend their time in con-
templating the glories of an ancient lineage; but
the European climate is much damper than ours,
and ghosts in Europe live to a good old age. The
hot winds of Melbourne would bs a spectre’s chief
trouble, and would dry np any sanctified ghost to
powder. The other ones might be able to stand
the heat.
* * *
Yes, the dear old-fashioned custom of
“doing the Block” still preval’s. Girls are doing
the Block who did it ten years ago and who have
each worn out a hundred pairs of boots in vainly
trotting about a Ger the husband who has never
come. Those girls’cheeks used to remind you of
roses ; now they only suggest apricots, and, poor
things!—they look particularly old whea they
laugh. At half pus i four, as in former fiavs,
there take 3 place on the Block the meeting be-
tween Bertie Jasper (the typical bank-clerk),
Signor Baritono (the adored artist), and the
highly-laced beauties of Melbourne. And, oh !
how the feminine blockaders do squeeze them-
selves into tight dresses! If yon are near a sym-
metrical-looking girl yon can hear a distinct
creaking like that of a tightly girthed horse. In
summer the tight lacing is not so apparent as in
winter, when odd days cf frost or rain compel
blockaders to wear thin and tightly-flcting
j ackets. Then the pressure of whalebone to the
square itch is positively awful. Some people
hope t hat the whales which members of the pro-
posed Victorian Antarctic Expedition are to catch
will have stronger bones than the species in
Nor hern seas. Good, strong whalebone would
have a ready market here.
# * *
In Eogland woman are celebrated for
their beauty, dress being a secondary considera-
tion. Here the society beauties are—pardon this
Hiberniclsm—year by year becoming more and
more ugly, but their gowns are dressmakers’
dreams and husbands' nightmares. Many badly-
dressed girls in Melbourne are very pretty, but
they are of a lower rank than the bPckadera, and
are beneath the notice of that haughty class.
Old and skittish women are great frequenters of
the Block. On cold days they would rather freeze
than hide their made-up haggith figures beneath
thick, warm mantle 3, and so it perhaps more
often happens in Melbourne than in any other city
that the rude man who has admiringly followed
for a hundred yards something neat about the
ankles and trim in the waist that he took to be a
pretty girl promptly tarns right-about face on
getting a glimpse of his charmer's withered face.
I not long ago saw the mother of nine refuse to
put on a jacket, It was at a football-match
and one of the coldest days of the year. The
poor old creature s false teeth chattered with the
cold, and she smiled in her bitter agony. This
class of women is known as “humbugs," but,
unlike that luscious sweetmeat, they are not at
all sweet. Hansom- oab drivers find the antique
blockader a good patron. It is, or was a few years
ago considered fast for a lady to ride alone in a
hansom. It is singular to find how popular han-
soms are with the ancient humbugs. Some of the
Melbourne ladies now-a-daya have private han-
soms. The drivers are, of course, young and
handsome, and form a wonderful contrast to the
owner inside, who leers at her masculine friends
in a manner that is positively ghastly. The
antique matron of to-day rejuvenates herself after
the manner of Faust, but, unhappily, without the
aid of a friendly Mephistophelei. She outs short
her grey hair and dyes it black or golden, accord-
ing to her humour and the taste of her various
admirers. Is it to be noticed,that in Melbourne
the older a woman grows the greater ii the
number of her masculine friends. No wonder the
daughters remain unmarried —their mothers do
not give young men time to fall in love with the
daughters. In summer, the antique blockade r
dresse3 in white like her girls, and in winter
she wears the neatest of tighc-flttirg gowns made
by a fashionable ladies'tailor I canoot say how
the unmarried daughters like their meti ers'
vagaries myself, nob being unmarried, but I
should think they had their private opinions on
the subject.

With the spread of the gospel of Imperial
Federation, the colonist who h*s been to England
is becoming more and more amusing for a few
weeks after his return. Having seen tne Queen
through a telesoops he bscomes an ardent Con-
servative, and at once stops his subscription to
The Bulletin. His daughter does the Block
with a subdued expression of condescension
to those who have nob m da a flying visib to
Europe on a Cook’s ticket, Australian girls find
the British nobleman a different animal on his
native shore, and nob so tame or easily captured.
The altered air of a returned Australian girl is
generally caused by the failure in Europe of her
matrimonial schemes.

Of late Collins street has been almost
entirely re built. In the new buildings are iefo
delightful little porches and nooks like sentinels'
boxes, where it is the custom of tha girl
blockader to stand in readiness to pounce on the
hapless man whom she has at present an inten-
tion of securing for herself. We affect to daspise
the lower orders of animals, but we do not despisa
their modes of securing their prey.
Red is very fashionable just now, but a
rad-haired girl wearing a hat to match does not
look so lovely as she imagines. At a recent
cricket-match I saw seven girl? in a row all wear-
irg piak dresses, white net hats, and all using
p Urn-leaf fans. They looked like the figures in
the familiar advertisement of Somebody’s
cigarettes.

An enlarger and colorist of photos, in
Sydney keeps what he calls his "death' register.
He watches the obituary columns of the daily
papers, and carefully notes the deaths. A week
after, while the grief of the family is st'll green,

instructions to carefully hide all knowledge of
the household’s recent bereavement. His can-
vassers generally succeed.
A correspondent writes :
A clergyman who waa until lately incumbent of a
parish near Sydney was requested on a recens day by a sor-
row-stricken mother to officiate at the grave of her three-
weebs-old child. “ Certainly,” replied the meek and lowly
one, “ but I must be paid, cash in advance, the sum of two
guineas for so doing.” In the absence of the father the
mother paid the money and the child was buried Upon the
father s return he tequested a receipt for the two guineas
which he got and forwarded to the Bishop, who, thereupon-
very properly ordered that the money should be refunded.
These facts speak for themselves.
We note a rare instance of hoaesty duly
rewarded. A careless man dropped a parcel con-
taining £5OO, and the lucky finder returned the
amount within an hour and received a-flfth of the
whole for his trou' le and his honesty. This
reminds us of a story half a century old, In which
the notorious Bill Nash, of Sydney, figured. The
old gold fakir had been to Homebnsh races, and
in hurry Irg to his gig dropped a fat roll of bank-
notes. This was observed by a new-ohum from
the Gieen Isle—green in more ways than one—
who hurried after the owner, and, breathless with
the chase, overtook him and returned the greed.
Nash, astounded at such an act in such times,
and amidst such people as Sydney boasted of 50
years ago, asked the finder how long he had been
in the colony. “ Just three days, sir." “ You’re
an adjective blank blank too honest for this
adjective climate; get out of it as soon as you
adjective well can,” and, without giving honesty as
much as a “ dump” to gtfc a drink with, he told the
driver to go ahead, leavii g the new-ohum a
sadder and, perhaps, a wiser man. Old hands are
fond of retailing another yarn about Bill. The
sentence under which he honoured N.S.W. with
hi 3 presence did not permit of his return home,
but Bill thinking his wealth entitled him to
a trip without permission, took French leave.
On reaching London he set up in grand style—went
to the extent of driving, it is said, a coach and
six before Her Gracious Thie, of course, would not
have been permitted even had the owner been one
of the “curled darlings’' of the nation. Enquiries
were made and the returned exile was ordered
by the then Prime Minister, Lord John Russell, to
clear out within four-and-twenty hours. Bill took
the hint, and returned consequently crestfallen to
Sydney society and semi-bondage.

Melbourne, in the early days-fancy a green-
grocer’s shop in Collins-street now ! By careful
industry, he developed into an importer, got into
Parliament, and made himself a name over the
Ballot Bill After the enactment of the ballot in
the Southern colony he went home —before Eng-
land had abolished open voting—and was lionised
as the “father of the ballot.” On his return he
re entered Parliament and assisted in carrying a
vote of want of confidence in the Heales Ministry.
The Government appealed to the country and
came back with a majority, but in a few months
broke up. and Nicholson succeeded as Chief Secre-
tary. The ballot is the only piece of legislation
with which his name is coupled, and but for it he
would have died in political obscurity
Yet another yam concerning “ Old

Whan a little boy he was employed by hi< brother,
a butcher, to drive cattle from a distance of 120
miles, Hehadtoc csatherlverMurray, andthefare
across in the punt for himself and his Pegasus was
one “bob.” “ Jimmy” held it, and wanted to ; he
therefore drove his steed into the water, hung on
to its tail, and so landed on the other side, and
saved the fare. He ascribes hia rise in life to the
husbanding of that coin. He cannot now fix
within many thousands the number of his sheep
and cattle, but he is happily cognisant of the
faot that his station-holdings include 14 of the
la-gest in Queensland. There’s no pride about
“Old Jimmy” The smallest “supe” and
ronpeabout on Vs station can refer to him as
“ Old Jimmy Tyson,” and they won’t get fired
out. It is only in large towns that he piVs up at
hotels, otherwise he always travels In a spring cart

Just before Christmas, the managing pro-

members of his staff as to the extent to which

If a hostile fleet held the seas for a few

At a recent banquet at Maryborough (Q.),
the nnw Queensland minister for Mines likened
himself to a political mouse, and said he was
proud of a one-man Government, and didn't care
to belorg to any other. After this he compared
Psalmyell Griffith to Moses, Joshua, and Bis-
marck, and wound up by asserting that the colony
was not big enough for him. What a splendid
“instrument’ he would make in the hands of
a certain Southern Premier 1
Sir Bryan O’Loghlen said at Belfast, Vic. :
—“ Many were fond of talking of Freetrade as a
principle, but this was absurd, as there was no
principle in Freetrade or Protection. The question
was simply one of expediency.” The humorous
aspect of this par. lies in the fact that the state-
meat, almost wosd for word, is taken clean from
President Cleveland’s message which the Free-
trade Press is making suctucapi al of, and the two
men are, both of them Protectionists down to
the ground!
The S.M. Herald weeps in a recant
issue over the alleged fact that there are 100,000
unemployed in New Y ork, and wints to know why
Protection doesn’t find them fomething to do.
For the information of that bulky journal we
would mention that New York has for many years
received from 100,000 to 300,000 destitute paupers
from Europe annually, most of them from Free-
trade Britain, and, thanks to Protection, the
country has found work for them all except the
handfal over which the Herald is eo badly
mortified.
Premier Psalmyell Griffith makes big
capital out of flaunting the “ black labour ” bogey
before the Queensland electors, although M il-
wraith has publicly renounced it, and Sir
Thomas is a man (unlike Sam) whose word can
be taken. But Sam himself was a “ black labour ”
and “yellow labour” man, too, till he found
which way the wind blew. He said, on July 7,
1874, in the House : “ I have no objection in the
world to the introduction of Coolie emigrants and
others, but the views I have always advocated
are that every person who liked to come should be
at liberty to do so and he added, “ I will not be
a party to putting a poll-tax on the Chinese."
Queensland electors should know the worth of
Sam’s “ principles ” by now !

Dear Bulletin.-So the inspired idea of fchab
fine aristocrat, “ Noblesse Oblige," has borne fruit: the
w rthy Governor Loch is to get an extra £6OOO in order that
“ distinguished " globe-trotters may he able to hang up their
hats behind the door that leads into the shop, “doming
events cast their shadows before,” and so, perhaps, these
titled gentry can see that their little game of spoliation in
the Old World is nearly played out, and they are giving Aus-
tralia a turn to spy out anything woith devouring. I deny
that the investment of foreign capital in our cities will enrich
the communj W; it simply means putting money in the l*nd-
lord's pocket, the rent or interest of whioli will have to be
paid to an absentee landlord instead of a local one. As for
the era of ‘‘unexampled prosperity,” there are numbers
around Melbourne who can tell a different story. During
the last 12 months good tradesmen have been taking
contracts in the building line for prices that wouldn't
pay ss. a day. An old friend of mine, strong, steady and
industrious, with a wife and four children depending on his
labour, has been glad to work for 335. a week. Eighteen-
pence of this had to go for a railway fare; that left 31s. Gd.
to clothe and feed six—not bad in a land flowing with milk
and hon<-y for the favoured classes, is it ? Of course, hun-
gsrers alter the crumbs that fall from the Governors table,
as I take “ Nobleas* Oblige *’ to be, like our M.sP., who
would give more of the taxpayers’ money to a man already
monstrously overpaid, never hear of these oases, and will not
thank anyone for making them public A little while ago,
when this highly favoured man asked for a rise, he was told
that labour was at a discount. Were some employers ques-
tioned as to their results for the year, they could say—with
the American manufacturer the great Henry George tells
about—that they had been specially favoured—material had
never been so cheap, nor labour so plentiful.—Youre, J,

Society
A snug little meeting convened by a neat
little circular addressed to the very best people,
has been held in the Mayor of Melbourne*** o *rn
particular roo-n at the Town Hall The meeting
was chiefly ladies in their best clothes who came
to express sympathy with the domestic happiness
of Prince and Princess Tummy, and arrange for a
silver-wedding-glft on the 2oth anniversary of
their nuptials. The Mayoress fell heavily Into
the chair, Lady Clarke expressed the sympathy in
a resolution, Mrs. Francis Ormond seconded it,
and a couple of K.C. M, G.s warmly supported it.
Just at this point Mayor Benjamin arose and men-
tioned, in a voice shaken by emotion, that he had
received a letter from Sir Edwin Smith, the Mayor
of Adelaide, asking what steps were being taken in
Victoria to meet the blessed occasion. This showed,
said Beni imln, “ that the other colonies were a 'ive
to the matter .” Jehoshaphat! After cheering bad
somewhat subsided, it was resolved to appoint a
committee, consisting of (read this carefully) j
“ Lady Clarke and all the other ladies present.’’
Sir James Macßain then went round with the
list, and collected £lOO from the Clarkes and £l6O
from the remainder of the meeting, which wasn’t |
much, cons’dering that
the ladies present repre-
sented, according to Sir
George Verdon, “ the
wealth of the colony.”
No language can tell the
utter thinness of this sil-
ver-wedding grovel. It
is destitute of the palest
shadow of a backbone.

’Enry, how d’you find yourself ? An’ you, my
lady, are you first class ? ’’ she gasped effusively,
“ I’ve cleared me best room for your ‘ sweetis-

chill, and it staied blankly into the far, far away,
whilst Sir ’Enry plucked his beard, and started to
talk about the weather. His hostess' imagined he
travelled with a suite of furniture in tow.

There was a crowd of people at the Dune-
din office cf the Union 9.5. Co., all anxious to get
tickets for the Tarawera's la it trip to the S rnnds,
and many of them positively swore when a shabby,
dusty, horsey-looking man with a fifth rate has
and a face like a crying evil, elbowed his way
past them and said he wanted to see the manager.
The elegant clerk behind the counter siz d him up
as a stone-broke wanting a job, and replied that
the feeling wasn’t mutual and the manager didn’t
want to see him. Then the shabby nun sail
sternly that he i oould see the manager, and the
clerk replied that he wouldn’t, and when he said
hat he was going to see the manager right off
and moved towards the door, the clerk got in
,ont of him and said that he wasn’t going to do
anything of the kind. The stranger said he would
be dashed if anyone would stop him, and the clerk
replied that he might be dashed if he wanted to,
but anyhow these premises weren’t the place for
any dead be vb to be dashed in, and he had better
leave. At this crisis, the manager put his head
out of the door and issued his indignant ukase :
“Turn that man out,” and he went. Next d-y,
the irate boss saw his seedy visitor lolliDg on a
sofa in the Grand Hotel, and learned that he hal
fired out a comparatively inoffensive British lord
who only wanted to get a ticket. The peerage
has become so numerous In Australasia of late,
and it is so utterly impossible to tell a lord from a
barrow-labourer, that the Upper House is not
properly grovelled to half the time.

\ It was in tie good old times on the Ed-
ward River, that a Jackaroo—whom pa was a
I bayonet, by Jove! and who had been accustomed
to have his horses looked after by a groom, don’t
you know—arrived on one of t*e stations. He
was sent on a message to another station, and
given one of the best horses on the place, with
orders to take great care of his mount. He got
to his destination all right, and next morning,
when the horses were brought io, he went with
the rest to the stockyard to catch his horse. Ar-
rived there, his eye wandered hopelessly over the
mixed mob of animals, and, at last he diffidently
got down off the fence and proceeded to catch a
horse whioh, by some accident, chanced to be his
own. The boss had seen his vacant stare, so he
determined to try and “take a rise out of him."
“ Hi! ’ said he. “ what are you going to do with
that horse ? What are you catching that horse
for?” “Isn’t he my home?’ gasped the new-
ehum. “ Your horae !” said the bo3S, with sar-

casm in his tone. “ They never owned a horse
like that one on the station you come from. Your
hor;e don’t appear to be in the yard, he must
have got away.” “Heavens! what shall I do?’
said the other, “ they told me to take such care of
him." “Well,” said the boss, “I'll send after
him, and I will lend you that horse to go home on ;
but you’ll haye to sign an agreement to return that
animal or £SO within a week, because I can see you
ain’t a man to be trusted with a valuable horse.”
The new chum accepted those terms, and rode
home sadly, having borrowed his own horse and
agreed to forfeit £5O if he dida't give him back in
a week. It was the same innocent who bo eight a
mare very poor, and turned her out in a p uldock
for a couple of years, at the end of which time he
found what he believed to be a strange mare, very
fat, with a yearling colt and a foal at foot running
in the paddock, and, filled with indignation at such
trespassers, he pounded the lob. No one turned
up to c’aim them, so they were sold out of the
pound, and the new chum bought them, after a
spirited competition with a little Irish horce-
dealer, for £l5. It was his own mare with two of
her progeny.

Hon. Trickett is moving for an inquiry in
the N, S.W, Upper House as to the names and
rank of the people who ate poor Lord Augustus
Lof tus into chronic in o'vency at Government
House, Sydney. He also d’sires to know if there
was or was not a sum of £lOOO voted to the hen-
rearing Augustus to defray the cost of feeding
(the itinerant nobles of Europe, and, if so, did the
nobles eat more than the £lOOO worth, and if they
did why the deuce did he let them do it 1 He is
further anxious to ascertain how many barons it
took to consume the quantity of victuals above-
described and how much victuals each baron had,
and whether Lord L. bought the provisions in the
cheapest market with a reasonable discount for
cash, or whether he allowed himself to be im-
posed on only by local shopkeepers through sending
his aide-de camp to the store in the next street
whenever the supply ran out. If the bills for the
provisions can be found and produced it would
also be satisfactory to know whether the eggs
were bought by the crate cr were supplied
from the gubernatorial poultry-yard, and, in
the latter case, were they charged for at cur-
rent ra'es or tow? Furthermo.’e, was the
ham as well as the eggs produced on the
premises, and, supposing it was could the
ex-Gavernor drive a pig through a gats without
the animal rounding on him and rushing against
him with Its muddy carcase ? Lor i Loftus him-
self asserts that it wa n’ ■ so much the distin-
guished visitors as those who thought they were
distinguished wh >br>k' him up, hut it will bs
necessary to find out how he knew a distinguished
visitor when he saw him, and also how he kne w
one who only fanoied that he was distinguished,
! and, in regard to the latter, how did he know he
; wasn’t} distinguished it the visitor didn't know it
himself, and why on earth didn’t he tell him so at
i the time ? What is a distinguished visitor, any-
how, and what are his ear marks ? It is neces-
sary, of course, to draw the line somewhere, but
should it be done at the viscount who humps his
own luggage from the wharf, or at the peer who
arrives in a cab and tells the driver to charge the
fare to the Consolidated revenue, or at the K.C B
whom the Governor falls over and breaks his leg
while he is kissing the girl on the stairs ? All
these questions will have to be looked into if the
matter is to be satisfactorily fixed up, and, even
then, the results will noc be all that could be
wished unless the washing-bills of that past date
can be resurrected from the file and laid before
Parliament. If it can be proved by these doou
meats that the dukes who put up at Government
House, Sydney, struck a fair average of one shirt
and 26 pairs of cuffs then there can be no possible
doubt that Lord Lof tus was grossly imposed upon
and that N.S.W. has suffered an outrage which
cannot be washed out except in blood.

What the whole Empire stands up to ask is why

From the moment when Her Majesty is

until the time when she “ graciously ” condescends
to go to sleep after a heavy supper, she hauls that
wired, dog-eared parb of speech behind her, and
apparently she can’t get rid of it. We don’t wish
to be needlessly particular, but if Victoria oould
contrive for once to do something or anything in
f an ordinary commonplace way instead of doing it
“graciously” she would give a seriously exhausted
nation a rest.

parson was there and tho wedrfi'nt breakfast; a
lot of small boys were gathered round the church
door ; a genial dog-fight wai in progress at the
very gate of the s anctuary; do svn the
road a horse was bfiting with a loaded
dray, and in the adjacent yard the children
had tied two cats toge her by the tails
and hung them ac oss a line. Everything was
provided for down to the smallest accessory, but
things hung Are for want of the bridegroom, and
the half intoxicated boy who had charge rf the
wedding chariot sweltered in the sun, and
cheeked the solemn piliceman on his
“bate,” and waited for somethlrg to ensue.
Thera was an awkward pause of several honra
duration during which the weddh g party shifted
uneasily from one leg to the other. Then the
bride spoke, with the beaming smile which had
captivated the heart of the young man who hadn’t
turned up. “ Bother the bridegroom,’ she said ;
“let’s have the wedding breakfast without him
Let’s go in for enjoying ourselves He never was
much account anyhow. Darn the bridegroom. I’ll
get another on*;” and with that a jovial party
started for home in the hired vehicle*, and fel
the victuals. Girls wio are so thoroughly
equal to tin eme gency are rare, and about 10 or
15 eligible young men are already thinking of
marrying this one. Another young lady at
Melbourne went through a somewhat simi-
lar experience last week bub just as the
performance was about to fall through, one of
the boys, with great presence of mind, ran round
to the bridegroom’s favourite pub, and fetched
him along to the altar, where he was stood up and
helped through the service with a friend shoring
him behind. He tot’ered a good deal at the criti-
cal parts of the proceedings, but the affair ended
satisfactorily, and they went home to live happily
ever afterwards.

When the emigrant ship Bulimba made
her last voyage out to Brisbane, the voyageurs—
but more particularly the voyage uses—had a
high old time of it, according to the doctor. He
says that the captain would order ths piano on
deck and request the first mate —a captivating
youth with a fetching smile and Percy for a front
name—to bang the accompaniments for the girls,
who warbled “Only* a Pansy Blossom," and
“ Pretty White Lilies " while the good ship delved
across tha wobbly. This, i,t seems, isn’t the
official way to treat emigrants, and the doctor
and the cap’uin used to argue it out once a day
«nd twice on Sundays with a marlinspike apiece
until they fell into the lee scuppers. The Marine
Board is now exercising itself over the matter,
and the doctor and the captain never speak as

The following little “ad.” is extracted

Here's an authentic anecd <te of that scion
of British nobility, Lady Munro. Kate was reeling
a’onf? hall-jeas-over down aside-walk in Sydney
Domain, the other day, when she saw a dls-eou-
table old Irishwoman Equaled up against the
wall sacking at a bottle. BsiDg rather dry, Kate
came over the grass and requested the other lady
to go whacks. The othsr lady refused. Whereon
Kate said, with considerable dlgni y, “Woman,
do you know who I am ? I’m Lady Munro!"
The acushleen waved the bottle and replied,
nmshlnsly, “Garrout wid yer, woman! D’ye
know who lam ? Im Lady !” That wat
too much for Kate. She dropped a tear and
pasied on. The grand old British nobility, there s
nothing like it!

Some two years ago H. E. Wood, the
Adelaide Curator of Intestate Estates, became
suddenly afflicted with scarceness, and in the
velocity of his going off forgot to leave behind
him intestate estates to the value of £15,000,
which bacame more intestate still through the
üb*er impossibility of finding them after he had
eone away. It is not alleged exactly that he took
this property with him, but he forgot to tell the
owners where he had put it. A girl disappeared
at the time he left, and, though there is no positive
proof that she went away with him, it is admitted
that she was there before he went, and she was
none immediately afterwards, which led a good
many people to suppose he had taken her. Wood
wasn’t anybody in particular before he went away,
but he is now a magistrate in Northern Mexico,
and owns 100,000 acres of land and lives in terrific
style, and ha has married a Mexican girl with a
pHa of money. Under these circumstances he
seems to be ra her glad that he lefo, though ths

There are a good many strange features In
London journalism. For some years past a writer,
whose signature was “ Miranda,” furnished sundry
columns of . irly wirly gossip every weak to the
Lady’s Pictorial, avid now it comes as rather a
shock to the readers of that paper to discover that
“ Miranda” was a male individual, and bore the
name of Archibald M'Neffl. Young girls, middle-
aged girls, elderly girls—girls of all sorts, in fact
—poured their confidences into “ Miranda’s” ear.
They wrote asking him to expound dark points re-
garding stockings and frilling ; they consulted
him on cosmsties and hair washes and things that
would remove pimpl s; they took his opinion on
the subject ot trimmings for delicate garments
which are worn in the silent watches of the night
and “ Miranda” answered them all and breathed
soft ccrfilencss into the pink ea<? of the public.
Ttey all gave themselves away uader the impres-
sion that he was a woman, and he tr ain't a woman
after all. And now “Miranda” has come to a
sudden end. It would have been all right, doubt-
less, if he had confined himself strictly to writing
woman items, as that is an occupation at which
comparatively few men get mu dered if they are
ordinarily careful, but he went away to report the
amith-Kilrain prize-fight, and a day later his d-jad
body was fond in th ? Seine. The man who had so
long dispensed sage advice on stockings and cor-
sets and other articles of underclothing had been
robbed and strangled by some “pug.” or other,
and had carried with him into eternity an exten-
sive knowledge of how the British female is made
up When last seen alone, “Miranda” was
mashing a barmaid and liquorlng-up, and he left
behind him a large assortment of unopened cor-
respondence from girls who wanted to learn how
they could prevent white satin shoes from getting
baggy, and thus leaving an impression that their
feet were twice their proper size, mixed with
epistles from little darling I who were anxious to
know what effect asses’ milk would have if ap-
plied externally to a waist that was 17 inches
round. Some one else will have to settle these
points now, for “Miranda” is waving the dish-
cloth of fashion from the battlements of the
Golden Shore.

James Berry, the British hangman, had
killed 113 individuals up to the 20th of last month.
Most of them died without a struggle, a few suc-
cumbed to slow strangulation, and one mans
head cams clean away from his body in the ex-
citement of the moment Berry, as already men-
tioned in The Bulletin, is "‘a Tory, through and
through ’ ; so is Mrs Bsrry. When baby will let
her run out for an hour she likes to attend an
execution herself, and see James drop ’em. Mrs.
B is 31 come next September, ,nd considered
quite the lady in her bonnet. Which reminds us
that Nosey Bob has a nice-looking nephew living
at Parramatta, who says uncle is a pleasant old
gentleman when you get to know him intimately.
And, while we are throwing off these social items,
it won’t be out of place to mention that Mr. Berry’s
latest victim was Dr. Phillip Cross, a Cork sur-
geon who poisoned his aged wife with arsenic and
strychnine, in order to marry a buxom governess
named Skinner, who became his very own a week
or two after the grave had clos id over the poor
old girl. Dr. Cross (who left £20,000, of which
£6OOO was willed to Miss Skinner) is described as
having had a fine martial bearing, handsomely-
cut features, and a bold, fearless countenance.
He was a splendid cross-country rider, and was
the son of a man whose will contained a clause
bequeathing “ his body to the hounds and his soul
to the devil.” Dr. Cross died apparently without
fear, and the executioner said that he felt more
than ordinarily sorry for his victim, who seemed
“ such a brave old man.” Never, perhaps, since
the extreme penalty was first enforced was a cul-
prit supplied with such a coffin as that used for
Dr, Cross's remains in the gaol Externall r* he
coffin was of plain varnished oak, but internally
it was lined with linen, whilst the head of the
dead man rested upon a large pillow covered with
white satin Mr Berry, who does a very exten-
sive business in selling bacon on commission, is in
good circumstances, and was accompan’ed on his
trip over to Ireland by his wife. Apropos of
bacon, perhaps it is just as well for the noble
British public that they are not aware that human
flesh is, in a certain South Sea Island region,
known as “long pig.”

Some time ago that noble peer, the Mar-
quis of Clanricarde, hid to pay £2500 on a vu’gar
libel-suit. The Marquis draws £23,000 a year
from his Irish property, which he has not Been for
13 years, and does a profitable shent per shent
trade in London to eke out his scanty means of
subsister ce. He lives like a Chinaman, and a
cheap Chinaman at that, and the proceeds of his
three-ball enterprise are carefully invested every
year. Some time ago his starving Irish tenants
applied for a reduction of rent, and were told
through his agent—an unhappy bog-trotter named
Blake—that they might go to perdition, individu-
ally and ooileotlvely. Then Clanricarde declared
that Blake had given this answer on his own re-
sponsibility, while he himself was sitting in the
family “spout” devising means to relieve the
suffering peasantry, and some broth of a boy went
out and blew the agent’s head off in the gloaming
of an autumn day. A lout named Joyce came out
from the wilds of Galway to fill the vacant billet,
and again Clanricarde was asked for a reduction,
and he replied as before, that the tenants might
slide into eternal fire. Tt en, a month or two
latter, he- sent along an explanation that
this answer was Joyce’s malevolent invention just
as the previous one had been Blake s, but the man
who fired at Joycs miss® his aim, and the Gal-
way agent sued his master fqr a libel that had
nearly ended in his vitals being paved with lead.
He got £2500, and since then Clanricarde has
been more abjectly Chinese than ever in his
housekeeping in order to make up the loss, and
when young swells come to him in the endeavour
to raise the wind and are told that he hasn't got
the money himself eut that he has a friend in the
city who might raise it a great cadi(ici, the in-
terest is higher than it ever w a bef-re, and the
young men get sold up faster and. can't renew

action.

The chairman briefly referred to the ruinou
depression at present existing, the principa
reasons assigned for same being that oi Si
Henry Parkes' intention of closing the Devonshire
street cemetery, coupled with the ffiot that he ha
given his word to our popular Governor that no
another tody wi 1 be interred, therefore tfcere wil
be no more funerals there j but the most im
porbantand paramount reason being the immen?
importations of the famous life-giver, St. Loui

press its importation into these colonies, mear
“the death-blow to our business as Under
takers.”
The Mariposa was detained in quarantine a few
daps simply because there was a single case o
small pox aboard. This great care taken by the
public health authorises and the wonderfu
quality and brilliancy of that far-famed Sb. Louis

An Old Australian writes from England.
Dear Bulletin,—l lived in Australia for
many years. On my return to England it became
my habit to look upon “ home” matters from a
colonial point of view, and to compare the two
countries in their social, political, and climatic
conditions. The opinions I have formed, right
or wrong, are original, honestly expressed, and
may serve to amuse these who have been long
enough from “ home” to have partially forgotten
its distinguishing characteristics. Emigrants
generally leave England with regret, and retaia,
amid thrir varying fortunes, a strong desire to
return. Old associations, tinted with the roseate
hues of hope and sentiment, have left indelible im-
pressions on their minds Separation has caused
them to dwell upon all that is best and brightest
in the pioture, to the exclusion of its darker
shade?.. The feeling is natural, but when pos-
sessed in an inordinate degree it has a tendency to
limit, if not to'mar, the success that generally
waits upon sustained effort and perseverance. It
induces haste in the selection, and recklessness in
the conduct of business. How many thousands
tell the tale of mistakes made and oppor-
tunities neglected in the hurry to make money
and get “home?" When the object is achieved
4n how few cases does the reality answer expecta-
tions? Altered tastes, matured habits’, and loss
of sentiment, all help to dispel the illusion. In no
case is th* revulsion of feelirg greater than in
respect to our climate. Disappointment, deepen-
ing to disgust, is the first feeling on a revived ac-
quaintance with if. He who has lived in an
almost endless sunshine, unpleasant at first from
its monotony, hut which has grown upon him
until its prese r ce has become a necessity, is ill-
fitted to admire, or even to tolerate, the opposite
extreme of drizzle and fog for the greater part of
the year. In some seasons, from the middle of
October to the end of M*y, there are but few
glimpses of the son, and very little of what de-
serves to be called daylight Spring, about which
poets have raved, is sometimes' ushered in wich
two months of piercirg east wii ds, which seem to
penetrate to the marrow, cutting through the
clothing a 3 though ’ewere mere gossamer, drying
the country, and stunting the vegetation, much
as the “ hot wind ” does in Australia ; inducing
colds, bronchitis, a3thma, phthisis, and a whole
train of ailments Summer cannot be depended
upon, for oftentimes there are not more than
two or three weeks of really warm and bright
weither, and this is not certain, for days'together.
With overhanging clouds, alternating from wet to
dull, and dull to wet, it often becomes a marvel
how crops can be grown and housed. Asa great
portion of your people have to live by labour,
some of them are probably discontented with their
lot. I will, for their especial behoof, attempt a
short sketch of the conditions under which thou
sands of men in England are condemned to live
and work Ic will show how greit a “ factor ”is
climate in the sum of bumm health and happi-
ness. Remember, I epeak mcstly from the poor
man’s point of view. Tne “Squire” jumps on
his horse and goes hunting in rain and fog. Exer-
cise keeps him warm Excitement gives zest to
his occupation. Retnrni g hone, he changes his
clo hes, and ea’s and d inks of the best with a
t'emendous appetite. The rich man of Belgravia,
in his magnificent rooms, splendidly lighted
and warmed, feels an added- sense of c m-
forfc by a comparison with the inclement
wea f her outside. Not so vith the poor fel-
low who sweeps the streets and shovels the
snow from his doors ; his heme is a wretched
house, with small, inconvenient apartments, and
not many of tnem, in a crowded court built in
by houses and high brick walls, green and dank
with continued moisture, over which the sun can
rever penetrate. A yard, too small for children
to play in during the best weather, paved with
coarse, unsightly stones; the ofiic s and a-oessc ries
close to the doer ; the man’s wages 18?. per week
to support himself, wife, and family of six chil-
dren ; a stinted allowance of l£ c*t. of coal per
week, any excess to come out of t* e already too
scanty supply of food. Time, winter: snow falling
and covering the yard and street with an inch of
Blush ; darkness in daytime almost opaque ; the
children come in from school, blue nosed with the
cold, their feet wet and chill ; they huddle round
the poor apology for a fire ; iu due time the father
arrives, wet to the skia, and, having litt'e or no
change of clothing, suffers in consequence. By
the poor light of a tallow-candle or humble lamp
the elder children, at the one table in the house,
attempt to work out their schotl-lesEons while
sorely disturbed and anneyed by the squalling
and quarrelling of the younger branches. A
keen N.K. wind sets io, converting the
slush into solid ice, and, penetrating through every
nook and cranny, cuts ltke a knife; clothing too
poor and thin for the season, and the food poor in
quality and deficient in quantity, ill-dressed and
ilhcooked ;. meat, a thing oftener dreamt of than
tasted, a bit of bacon or a herring or two in its
stead ; weather changes from frost to a drizzle of
two or three weeks’ continuance, during which the
wretched house is the orly possible shelter ;
dirt and darkness everywhere ; the wife seamstress
can hardly thread her needle or continue her work
away from the lamp ; the washing to be dried at
the too-small fire, for they cannot hang the clothes
outside. Some cf the children fall sick, and as
the “parish doctor” is the only one within ths
means of the father, he is called in to prescribe
medicines, nourishing diet, warm flannel clothing,
extra blankets on the beds. and a fire ups’airs, and
this out of 18s per week ! Is it strange, that,
under circumstances such as ihese, the father
should occasionally find his way to the “ pub.,”
where there is always warmth, light, end a cheap
oblivion from the dull miseries that surround him ?
I should like all labourers in Australia to
have one. glance at the damp, dark horrors
of an existence like the one described, and
which, I am sorry to say, is not overdrawn. Would
it not make them appreciate the difference of the
conditions under which they live, and teach them
to be thankful for the bettered prospects of their
children and connections? Of course, the pinch-
ing poverty and unwholesome surrounding of the
British workman are due not alone to climatic
differences. Pressure of population, monopoly of
land, and unlimited competition also play a tre-
mendous part, and) with the rapid absorption of
Australian territory by London syndicates, the
continual stream of pauper immigration to the
great colonial centres, it is only a question of a
few years and the condition of the Australian
workman will, I fear, greatly resemble that of his
English brother. If he only awakened to a sense
of the probable future and safeguarded his
present by expelling the Chineae, compelling
the. Government to aid local industry, and
nationalising all the public estate in land, he
might avert such a doom But he won’t, and
Nemeeis will come in due course. I would not have
you infer, from the above remarks, that I consider
the English climate, on the whole, unhealthy.
The rural population, who are exposed to it the
year round, are hale and strong, and would be re-
markably so were they better fed. The living of
the squire added to their labour would produce
fine samples of manhood. Artisans and persons
of sedentary occupations, who take the air in
homoeopathic doses, are the greatest victims to
climatic changes. The average Englishman at <lO
becomes stout and portly, especially in the waist,
looks well preserved, and at least 10 years
younger than the Australian at the same age.
Women at 45 are stout and ruddy, with little
tendency to “ scrag and parchment." Premature
baldness and gray ness (though much on the in-
crease) is not so common in England as in Aus-
tralia. Some of the seamen on our coasts are like
knotted oak at 70 years of age, Theirs, perhaps,
maybe cases of the “survival of the fittest.”
You will be surprised to learn that the returned
colonist, who has got through the cold and damp
of winter, is sweating, panting, and pro-
strate at what he terms the heat of
summer. With the thermometer at HOdeg.
in the sun, he grumbles more than he would at
loOdeg. in Australia. In the winter we have
little besides fog—in the summer steam. When
favoured with a bright summer (like this last) the
appearance of the country is truly delightful—
such a wanton luxuriance of verdure studded and
variegated by the mixed tints of myriads of wild
flowers and hedgerow-blossoms sweetly scented.
Imagination in its wildest dreams cannot picture
fairer scenes. It is sad to think we get them so
seldom—their continuance is so short and their
occasional existence only purchased at the cost of
a maximum of discomfort and wretchedness. I
have never yet met a returned colonist who likes
our olimate. The dulness and continued damp-
ness ha», in every case, a depressing influence on
the spirits from which there’s no escape. We are
agreed upon two points—lst, that it forces on
emigration ; 2nd, that it tends to reconcile one to
death.—Yours truly, A Growler. London,
December 22, 1887.

Robinson, of the Victorian Hansard staff,

by the sweet names of William and Valentine.
On the anniversary last week, the Dundreary

the Freetrade Argus many years ago.
The deepest place yet sounded is off the
coast of New Guinea, where bottom has been
found at a depth of 26,700 feet We devoutly
trust the place his been marked, and live in hope
that the magnificent Auckland (N.Z.) Harbour
Board will annex the territory, so that Dredger
No. 121 may have a chance of fstablishing a
colonial record for deep-sea mud-lifting. Besides,
it will keep tbe wl ite elephant out of mischief,
now that Calliope Dock is un fait accompli.
The delivery-boxes at Sydney Gr.P.O. are
clOEed for three or four hours in the middle of the
day whenever an English mail happens to arrive
in the morning, and yet, in comparison, the staff
is twice as large as that at London or New
York. In those cities delivery-boxes are nob
doted even for five minutes when a foreign or
other large mail arrives. We notice, by the way,
that the Postmaster-General’s public-house—the
Crown and Anchor—is not closed when goods
arrive which require sorting.
Editor Bulletin. - Sir, —The big lmpoit-
ing houses of Sydney are the bulwark of the Free-
trade party. Allow us to give you an example of
the genuine nature of these people. Recently
they signed an agreement to raise the price of
men’s colonial tweed trousers by 10 per cent. As
our firm is a comparatively young one, we have
to out things finer and work more keenly than
these big houses, with their monopoly of trade.
Consequently, we could not see our way clear to
sign the agreement, and these champion Free-
traders have brought pressure upon the manufac-
turers, with the result that we have received
notice to day that we can no longer be supplied
unless we join the combination. Fortunately, a
large supply on hand will keep us going until we
may be able to overcome this unj ost, and, to us,
most injurious attempt to restrict trade.—We are,
sir, yours respectfully, Cook, Rhodes, & Co.,
Wynyard-street, Sydney, Feb, 18,
FANCIED SECURITY.
Some years ago a line steamship was one stormy
afternoon running up the Irish Channel; she had
safely crossed the thousands of miles of ocean
between Australian and British waters, and in a
few hours it was confidently expected by those on
board that the end of their voyage would be reached.
The captain was a fine genial fellow, the officers
were favourites with the passengers, and before they
parted the passengers, invited the commander anc
his chief officers to meet them in the saloon and
re c sive their congratulations and thanks. Very
jovial no doubt they were, but while they feasted
the vessel was being driven out of her course,
and was slowly but surely steaming on to destruc-
tion. When their danger was discovered it was
too late; skilful steamship availed nothing, the
wind and sea proving too strong for them, and the
unfortunate vessel was dashed to pieces on the
coast, and the captain, several of the officers,
and many of his passengers and crew were
drowned. What was the cause of this
terrible shipwreck 2 Fancied security and con-
sequent carelessness and neglect of duty. Don’t
we beg of you, reader, if you have indications
of kidneys or liver difficulties dwell in a “ fool's
paradise” by reasoning with yourself that it will
soon pass away, or “ wear itself out, ” as too many
express it. Nay! it will wear you out and send
you to an untimely grave unless promptly grappled
with You must remember that the dread Bright’s
disease of the kidneys has no symptoms of its own,
and you maybe near to death’s dcor and not know
it until too late. If you have a deposit in your
urine, pains in the back, a restless uneasy feeling,
capricious appetite, no ambition, but rather, dull
and listless ; beware, as these are among the first
symptoms of serious kidney difficulty. Resort at
once to Warner’s safe cure and safe pills, follow
the dietary directions laid down, which accompany
the medicines, and you will recover. But neglect
these symptoms until they have aroused you by
manifestations that cannot be poo-poohed, and the
chances are against your recovery. As you value
your life do not trifle with disease, nor fancy your-
self secure, when your better judgment tells you

THE land is the best ever yet submitted by
subdivision around Melbourne, and it is
admittedly the acme and perfection of the most
fashionable, the healthiest, the most charming,
and the most romantic spot of Toorak, which, it
is needless to say, stands without a rival amongst
the suburbs of Melbourne. The Estate, which is
surrounded by Mansions, has a beautifully pano-
ramic view. For accessibility to the City the
Estate excels all other fashionable residential sites.
By road it is about fj miles from the Post-office;
by rail it is considerably less. The Glen Iris Rail-
way branches off from Burnley, and after travel-
ling one mile and three-quarters reaches the Rail-
way Station to be erected on Mr. Fergueon’s pro-
perty at the Glenferrie-road. This St ition is two
minutes’ walk from the GREAT TOORAK
ESTATE. By rail the City will be reached from
your breakfast-table comfortably in fifteen
minutes. The Toorak Tram, now in course of
construction, will take you from the heart of the
City to within eight minutes’ walk of the Estate

The other day a well-known politician
from a northern colony went Into Hosie's bar and
had a drink. Taking a great fancy to a pretty bar-
maid, he entered into conversation with her, and,
after preliminaries, asked her to come out with
him one evening. Looking at him straight in the
face she replied: “No, Mr . That is not
what you taught me when I was a pupil in your
class at Sunday-school. ’ He left then wiping his
heard.
An interesting point arises in connection
with Borne jewellery left (concealed in a bustle) at
a Birmingham hotel. To all intents and purposes'
the contents cf the bustle are proved to belong to
a Melbourne jeweller, but neither the jeweller nor
Secretary Deakin will stand the expense of bring-
ing over the arrested parties. The Birmingham
police have no legal case. Must they not restore
the jewellery to their r risoners ? And what about
the bustle ?

Among the many marvellous cures performed
by St. Jacobs oil which have come under the
observation of Messrs, J. W. Henley and Co,,
patent medicine vendors at 543 Commercial-road,
London, E., is that of Mr. S. Digby, formerly pro-
prietor of The King’s Arms, Stepney Causeway,
now of 34, Brook-street, Ral cliff, who, was an
intense sufferer for years with rheumatic gout,
during which time he employed medical men and
tried numerous remedies said to be specifics in the
case indicated, obtaining but little benefit, until
he used St. Jacobs oil, the great conqueror of
pain. A few applications of this marvellous oil
completely and almost instantly removed the pain.
As Mr. Digby expresses it: “One bottle of St.
Jacobs oil did me more good than anything else I
ever tried."

Three ladies were discoursing the question
of forgetfulness. “Well,” said one, whose hus-
band was a commercial traveller, “I think my
husband is the most forgetful man that ever
existed. He came home the other night after a
trip of several weeks’ duration, We had retired,
and as he was fat'gued he went off to sleep.
Shortly his hand fell to si roking my cheek, At
the same time he said, * Darling, won’t you please
tell me what your real name is ? ”
The old Sydney building, known to our
colonial forefathers as Hyde Park Barracks, with
all its black records of sin, sorrow, and crime, of
scourged hides and broken bones, has merged into
i respectability at last, and is in future to be known
as “Chancery-square.” Lawyers have taken up
their abode therein and where hides were flayed
before suitors will now be fleeced.
There was a time —not so long ago, either
—when the quiet little suburb of Aah field (Syd-
ney) was a sober place, where young men went to
bed at half-past 7 p.m., and where everybody fol-
lowed Ihe teachings of that moral cade which
says that a man shall not marry his grandmother
and a lot of things besides. A sinful rink, how-
ever, has changed all that—we don’t mean, of
course, that young men out there marry
their grandmothers, but they nj longer
go to bed at 7.30, and their evenings
are spent in tearing round on rollers.
Almost everybody under the age of 96 now dissi-
pates on ginger-beer and skates at the new Re-

the grave fasten a slippery contrivance of wheels
and straps on the other one, and cut youthful
capers on f he treacherous asphalt. Mr. Wybutdhes
laid in 2000 pairs of the best skates to meet the
increasing demands of a demoralUed public, and
the way of the transgressor is hard, especially
when he comes down with the back of his head
ega'nst it.

not eat anything ; passing a store I saw a ht of bell S
bitters in and. I get a bottle. After she had
been taking it a week she had a rousing appetite, and it did

desk, and walked cut without a wcrd. Upon his
return, half-an hour later, the note was gone, and
half-a-crown in tilver had taken its place. “ Boy,

weight." “Yes, sir; but you see, you hadn’t

From sn American punt :
The chiracteristic climate cf Australia and the pugnacity
of th« kangaroo makes hunting the hides dangerous. Winter
starts in May and ends in December in that country, ine
lest of the year the heat is intense, the thermometer fre-
quently reaching 140 degrees. Eight men hunt together tor
kangaroos They t re called a ‘ set.' Wren brought to hay,
the kangaroo jumps like a flash for a hunter s breas*, and
tries to crush it in with his fere feet. To prevent this each
man wears across his bresst a two or three mch thick mat-
ting. Armed with a spear, with a club attachment at the
I other end, they ride upon swifo hors s into a herd. With tee
asilityandeqnipoieeof circus-riders, they stard erect upon the
horses and use their spears and clubs. The kangaroo is able
to jump clear over a horse. As the game is kageed it is
skinned, and pegged down to prevent ihnnkage. ihe flesh
furnishes meat for the camp. Each man places a private
markup nhis booty, and when they have 100 skins apiece
they return back to civilisation. There are 20 varieties ot
kangaroos, among them the blue, red wallaby, black, grey,
and fo ester, the latter furnishing the beet leather, as it lives
mainly in wooded sections. When the shipping ports are
reached the hunters dispose of the skins by auction to tne
highest bidders, and realise about 70 cents a pound. an "
garoo-hUDtors make large profits. One man is known tobave
cleared 4500dcl free of living expenses in a single year.

A TALE OF THE PAST.
(BY ARTHUR GAYUL.)
If one were fool enough to try to walk
from Sydney to Parramatta, and so absolute an
asi as to turn aside from the ancient dirt road,
which owes its origin to the loud and blasphemous
race wfco drove the bullock-teams in the early
days of New South Wales, he would probably
come across a few noteworthy monuments of the
early years of this century. There is a dreaiy
plantation there, for instance, where the somb e
pines grow thick, and any old band will readily
point out a certain spot in one corner on which
once grew a tree which did good service as a gal-
lows in the days of the buried past. It grew
upon Colonel Johnstone s Annandale estate, and
men were hanged there, and women when
men ran shcrr, until at last the old pine wilheiei
away under the curie of human blood, and the
place it had occupied was left empty. Nothing
has grown there since. A little lurcher on, deep
down amid the thick bush that grows between
the road and the river, is a gruesome spot which
lies in perpetual shadow —a placs where the air is
always damp and cool, and which impresses the
stranger with its aspect of settled melancholy,
and makes him look around for the record of an
old time murder. Persons were very hands
with an axe in those early days— teste Mr. Lynch.
Th6re is no record, however —no merroriil tablet
or cross cut on a tree, or stone with undecipher-
able inscription, or any of those adjuncts of the
mysterious and horrible, that, in the story-book?,
Btand in the wayfarer’s path as the finger-posts of
crime. But there is a portion of an old stone
house crumbling away. Only the fragments of
some of the walls are standing—good, substantial
stone walls they were, for convict labour was
cheap to those who could command it, and they
built strongly in the early days. Great gnarled
trees grow all about, and thick underbrush clothes
the site of the foundations of which you can see
the Btony outcrop here and there. All around is
solitude. The very crows that croak and flap
their wings in the bony branches overhead seem
to croak in your ears an old-time tale of horror
and crime. But you might listen to the crows a
long while, and gaza at the abomination of deso-
lation before you for many a weary hour until the
gloom of it entered into your very soul before
they told you their ghastly story as plainly as it
was told to me.

Many sunny days have come and gone
Bince Lieutenant Smith arrived in Sydney in the
beginning cf the century, and received as a grant
the piece of land on which we now stand. He
was the younger son of an Exeter dootor—a
gambler and a roue, who had spent his money,
disgraced his relatives, made a failure of his life
while he was still a young man, and then bought
a commission—or had it bought for him—in the
New South Waits Corps. Of this gallant detach-
ment of British Eoldiers I will say nothing, the
indelible di? grace of their career is a matter of
history. But Lieutenant Smith was worthy of
his company, and that is high praise, in a certain
direction. He toots change of a detachment of
the corps iast reoruited in England from the
hulks, which embarked a? cf a convict
woman's-ship at Portsmouth for Botany Bay.
♦ • •
I am not going to describe the scece on
board that ship. God forbid that anyone should
strive to revive to the full its unspeakable
miseries I The women on board were of all
claeses. There was the harridan, hardened in the
vice that was second natore to her, and totterirg
on the brink of the grave. There was the pro-
curess, thrown over at the last by her wealthy
patrons, and left to the shorb shrift of the law.
There was the lady’s-maid who had borrowed her
fine mistress’s laces, and who had a hell of life-long
misery in prospect as the cosb of one Sunday's
finery ; the ruined street-walker, who had walked
the broad way of Pall Mall or the Strand that, for
such as she, leads to damnation, and walked it
once too of .en ; tlere were the little girl-pick-
pockets and shoplifters, whom the hangman had
spared for a worse fate; and the country girl,
who was sacrificed to the cruelty of Borne
young squire or his gamekeeper. All herded to-
gether—the good with the bad, the youDg with
the old, vice with innocence, and rural simplicity
with the cunning and crime of the great cities,
and the good ship went from her moorings, laden
with curses and weighted deep with her sorrow
and sin.
# • •
But the curses and the hideous aggrega-
tion of misery did not sink her, and she rolled
slowly over the waters snd left her track of
corpses behind her as a hundred other floating
tombs had done btfore. The officers, soldiers and
crew held high carnival, and the lieutenant was
in his element. Like the others, he had the privi-
lege cf selection among the female convicts, and
his choice fill on the body and soul of a little
peasant girl. She was the daughter cf a farmer,
and bad been a servant in the house of a Suffolk
squire till, in an evil hour, she attracted the
honest admiration of the son of a neighbouring
gentleman, who waß expected to marry a daughter
of the house. Then the girl was “removed” out
of the way. With cold, fiendish malignity her
mistre s fastened upon her an accusation of thef
and the ch'ld-woman, who threatened to be an
obstacle to her mistress's schemes, was sent out to
do a IOEg term at Botany Bay. But she had
brought with her her old-fashioned ideas of
honour and purity, and she rejec ed the li’u-
tenant’s advances in an agony of terror and
loathing. Then she was broken in to her sur-
roundings in the usual fashion of these good old
days. The lieutenant stood by and watched her
as her while.shoulders were torn and cut by the
cat, and amid her screams and piteous entreaties,
thirty lashes were inflioted. She died under the
punishment, and her remains were thrown over-
board, as the quickest means of getting rid of a
creature who was disobedient and mutinous when
living, and who was only an unpleasant memory
when dead. _
» • •
Her successor in the lieutenant’s affec-
tions was a painted Jezebel from London—a lady
of a strangely different stamp from the girl whose
baby face and long dark hair were rising and fall-
ing cn the distant waves, and whose tortured
body had gone to perpetual rest. She had got
into trouble on a charge of murder. A young
man who had come up from the country and had
then mysteriously disappeared, was- awkwardly
enough—found dying In her house, and there
were circumstances about his death which made
her escape from the hangman a very narrow one.
But she was not born for the rope and the noose,
and soon she be ame a painted and bedizened
queen reigning over a floating pandemonium, and
under her sway the lash was kept ever at work,
and the trail of corpses behind the slowly-moving
ship became daily more conspicuous.
It was a long passage, and for the lieutenant
and his paramour a merry one. But at last it
came to an end, and then a gang of assigned con-
victs built for their master a house between the
road and the river—the same whose ruins, crumb-
ling and overgrown with weeds, can still be
traced, though the bush has spread over the con-
viot Arcadia, where the Jezebel of the convict-
ship once reigned supreme. There were wild,
weird orgies in that lonely mansion in these by-
gone times, and the convicts in their huts could
hear the roar of blasphemy from the rooms where
their master caroused with his guests, and where
fiends incarnate sang and danced, and cursed and
drank, and told stories of the horrors they had
seen, until the good citizens of Sodom and
Gomorrah would have fled from them in affright.
Round the house the air was thick with blood and
hideous atrocities, and the smoke of these ini-
quities reeked up in the face of God’s sky, and
bio ted out all hope of mercy, either here or here-
after, in the souls of the crouching wretches
whom the law had abandoned in this seventh hell
of iniquity and torture.
* • *
Yet there wa3 luxury within to compen-
sate for the squalid horrors without. Among the
effects of a wealthy colonist, who recently quitted
Australia for England, was a wide, d«ep bath
of polished marbl«, and two names scratched upon
it with a diamond revealed its original ownership
and showed that Jezebel was, in some ssnse, a
woman of taste and refinement in her day. Every
morning this ba'h was filed with milk, and in it
she used to lave herself after the fashion of the
sensuous queens of the East, in order to preserve
her beauty, and keep her silky skin white and un-
wrinkled. She appreciated the value of exercise,
too, and when she grew languorous amid her
luxurious surroundings and pined for excitement,
she would order a number of convicts, both male
and female, to be brought out, and would flog
thorn until she was weary of the labour. Her
assis'ants In this amusement were the lieutenant
and his overseer—a convict thief who had been
this lady’s friend in the old days in London, and
whose nickname of Barabbas was a standing in-
sult to the Hebrew robber for whose release the
Jews clamoured on the day of the Passover -and
the trio enjoyed themselves gaily until the end
came, and then they enjoyed themselves no more.
* • *
There were plots and schemes innumerable
among the convicts, but there was always some
one among them who would betray them in the
hope of gaining the favour of the convict queen
who ruled the little settlement, and then it would
seem for a while as if a thoueand fiends were let
loose in all their aggregate malignity. But mean-
while the orgies were growing louder and wilder
and more frequent, and after each debauch it
generally happened that the lieutenant and his
lady were incapacitated for a time, and even the
latter-day Barabbas would be heavy and somno-
lent. And so time went on until a day came
when the chatelaine gob daintily into her marble
bath for the last time, and the lieutenant enjoyed
his last carouse in his mansion by the river, and
Barabbas drowned his heavy, sodden brain in the
fiery rum which he would never taste any more.
When such of the guests as were sufficiently
sober had departed, a band of frenzied men rushed
the house, and the lady and her lord were Bcized
together in their bedroom. Then Barabbas awoke
from a heavy drunken slumber beneath the dining-
room table to find himself a prisoner, and there
was another orgie, at which the conviots drank
toasts to the eternal misery of their old tyrants
and revelled amid the fragments of the feast,
while their prisoners waited and died a hundred
deaths in appalling anticipation of their fate.
• * *
There was a weird carnival amid the lofty
pine-trees that night. The civilisation whioh
the white man brought to the great lone
continent for the moral and spiritual elevation of
hia dark-skinned brother, had broken loose from
its conventional restrictions, and as the native
heard in the distant bush the shrieks and howls
that were borne upon the midnight breeze, he
fanoied that the hell, which the pale-faced
invaders had told him of, had assumed a concrete
form on earth. The three prisoners were tied
each to a tree-trunk, and the convicts took turns
in flogging them, and danced round them, echoing
baok their shrieks and curses ; the house was set
on Are, and a gang of fiends, who had once been
men, whirled round and round in the flamelight,
and whooped, and screamed, and sang wild scraps
of hoarse melody, till at last morning dawned and
they prepared for flight. Then the lieutenant
was hanged from the limb of a tree which cast its
shadow over his door ; his paramour, insensible
and apparently dying, was bound fast to the trunk
below him ; and Barabbas was dragged away with
his captors as they started their retreat into the
almost unknown wilderness which stretched away
in‘o the west.
* # *
The soldiers, however, were close upon
their track, and after a short rasistance, in which
the convicts fonght with the fury of despair, they
were captured and brought baok. Men and
women were hanged together round the smoulder-
ing ruins of their master’s heme, and, as usual,
civilisation triumphed, and the cause of law and
order was duly vindicated. But the rescue party
oame too late to save Barabbas. All that was
found of him was a charred cinder which still re-
tained some semblance of human shape, lying
among the ashes of a camp-fire, while some frag-
ments of wrapping showed that he had been sewn
in a bullock-hide, and then slowly roasted to
ashes. The leader in this final horror was a
woman whose daughter—also aconvicb—had been
Hogged and ruined by the lieutenant's deputy
in the days when that personage used to enjoy
his simple, primitive existence in the mansion
among the clustering pines; in the spirit of the
pagans of old she had offered up her daughter’s
murderer to appease the troubled soul of the dead
—but, then, civilisation had not taught her any
better. # w *
The lieutenant bimself escaped. By some
obance he had left the house along with a number
of his guests, and, in the darkness, the drunken
oonvicts had sacrificed a roistering individual of
the same pattern, who had stayed behind to bask
in Jezebel’s smiles. Bub the tyrant was terror-
stricken, and, resolving to take no more risks, he
fled to England, where he figured as a reformed
character with considerable effect. As for Jezabel
herself, she recovered, and, for 20 years after, a
crippled beggar, beaten almost out of human
shape, might have been seen crawling about the
streets of Sydney, the wreck of the dainty lady
who once dreamed away a luxurious existence
among the groves by the Parramatta River. She
died at last, bub where and when and ho w no one
ever oared to know, and, somewhere or other, she
found a grave. Her history was written chiefly
among the records of the " drunks ” ia the police-
courts, and her latter days were comparatively
harmless.

Dean O’Hea (R C.), of Melbourne, was
travelling by the rail the other day from Mel
bourne to Sandhurst and got into conversation
with a genial Protestant gentleman, who offered
him his aiomatio flask and then made some in-
quiries into the Dean's doctrine of future punish-
ment. Charles Adolphus explained the dogma of
Pnrgatory and the nature of indulgences, but the
genial gentleman of the pocket-pistol deolared
that he couldn’t assent to the theory of a middle
state, whereupon the sturdy Dean had this parting
shot at him as he got out at Kyneton to have a
mutton chop: “ Well, my dear sir, if you don’t
believe in Pnrgatory you may go to Hell!’’ The
genial gentleman began to think there was some-
thing in this, and put the flask thoughtfully to his
lips and found there was something in that, too.

gent comp, gob a deal closer to the eternal truth
than usual.
An enormous land-tortoise has been found
rear Lake Wendonree at Ballarat. The local
Tramway Company have secured its services, and
by running two trips where erstwhile they have
only run one, they hope to recoup themselves for
their outlay.
A Wanganui (N.Z.) hotelkeeper writes his
own bills of fare to save the expense of havißg
them printed. A recent one announoed :—“ Coffy,
soupe, rcste beef, fryed am, boyled and bakt
potatos, fried ooul puddln and minspy." An
apotheosis of phonetics!
We have it on the authority of the S.M.
Herald that “ior fully fifteen years H.R.H.
Albert Edward has never done anything which
has offended in the slightest degree even a section
of the public.” From this we hurriedly come to
the conclusion that the British public is badly in
want of a missionary.
