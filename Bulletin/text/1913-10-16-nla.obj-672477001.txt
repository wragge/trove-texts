WHITE TEETH.
This Powder is not only an Antiseptic and
Germicide, but cleanses mechanically, owing
to the evolution of free active oxygen when
the powder is in contact with water or the
oral fluids. It is the oxygen which, by neu-
tralising the acid-producing organisms of de-
cay. and dissolving mischievous deposits,
whitens the teeth so wonderfully, and wards
off decay as no other preparation for the
Teeth can or will do. Scientists agree that
a powder is superior to any liquid or paste
for cleansing and preserving the Teeth. The

recommend powder as best for the Teeth.

Verses by Henry Lawson
ABOVE CROW’S NEST, SYDNEY.
The Red Page
A blanket low and leaden,
Though rent across the west,
Whose darkness seems to deaden
The brightest and the best;
A sunset white and staring
On cloud-wrecks far away —
And haggard house-walls glaring
A farewell to the day.
A light on tower and steeple,
Where sun no longer shines —■
My people, O my people!
Rise up and read the signs!
Low looths the nearer high-line
(No sign of star or moon),
The horseman on the skyline
Rode hard this afternoon!
(Is he—and ivho shall know it? —
The spectre of a scout?
The spirit of a poet,
Whose truths were met with doubt?
Who sought and who succeeded
1 n marking danger's track —
Whose warnings were unheeded
Till all the sky was black?)
It is a shameful story
For our young, generous home—
Without the rise and glory
We'd go as Greece and Rome.
Without the sacrifices
That make a nation's name,
The elder nation's vices
Anl luxuries tee claim.
Grown vain without a conquest,
And sure without a fort,
And maddened in the one quest
For pleasure or for sport.
Self-blinded to our starkness
We'd fling the time away
To fight,, half-armed, in darkness
Who should be armed to-day.
This song is for the city,
The city in its pride —
The coming time shall pity
And shield the country-side.
Shall we live in the present
Till fearful war-clouds loom.
And till the sullen peasant
Shall leave us to our doonv?
Cloud-fortresses titanic
Along the western sky —
The tired, bowed mechanic
And pallid clerk flit by.
Lit by a light unhealthy —
The ghastly after-glare —
The veiled, and goggled wealthy
Drive ffyt —they know not where.
Night’s suHen spirit rouses,
The darkening gables lour,
From ugly four-roomed houses
Verandah'd windows glower;
The last long day-stare dies on
The scrub-ridged western side,
And round the near horizon
The spectral horsemen ride.
MY FATHER-IN-LAW AND I.
My father-in-law is a careworn man,
And a silent man is he j
But he summons a smile as well as he can
Whenever he meets with me.
The sign we make with a silent shake
That speaks of the days gone by —
Line men who meet at a funeral —
My father-in-law and I.
My father-in-law is a sober man
(And a virtuous man, I think) ;
But we spare a shilling whenever we can,
And we both drop in for a drink.
Our pints they fill, and we say, "Ah, well l”
With the sound of the world-old sigh —
Like the drink that comes after a funeral —
My father-in-law and I.
My father-in-law is a kindly man —
A domestic man is he.
He tries to look cheerful as well as he can
Whenever he meets with\ me.
But we stand and think till the second drink
In a silence that might imply
That we'd both get over a funeral,
My father-in-law and I.
From “For Australia, and Other Poems”
(Standard Publishing Co., Melb.).
In his latest collection of verses, For Aus-
tralia, and Other Poems, Henry Lawson
echoes himself —somewhat faintly. Yet in
these rimes on familiar subjects, treated
from a view-point that only Lawson’s wide
popularity has made too familiar, there is
an individuality that is not to be found in
the notes of any other Australian poet. A
rather winning individuality uttered with
an art that is naive and apparently uncon-
scious.
Candidly, Lawson’s view-point is rather
belated: the decade of bitterness has gone
by: our poetry has got over its growing
pains. The literature of this Australia of
to-day is hopeful, vitalised by a new in-
stinct of nationhood. Our poets are no longer
facing the horizons of the west: they are
eagerly looking up to the zenith, looking into
the future. They are no longer demolishing
things: they are beginning, quite cheerfully,
to build. The class-war has fizzled out into
a rather uninteresting peace; the under-dog*
roams unmuzzled about the Speaker’s chair.
Its owner, pulling perspiringly at its chain,
is unwillingly being dragged along—and each
yard there is less of him to drag. The old
State bitterness survives only in the dead
editorials of the press of the capitals: Aus-
tralians have discovered Australia —the
clinAx to the most momentous work of ex-
ploration done in the twentieth century. Our
literature is beginning to live in the future.
The night is over and gone.
And Lawson’s complainings begin to sound
rather fretful. The present scribe does not
own a motor —does not want to own one—
but to Lawson there is nothing nicer in a
motor: he is rather prejudiced against
motors. And are all
Inventors, artists, poets —
Exiled or driven mad,
Btreated, sneered at, slandered,
And driven to the bad?
And is there one critic in Australia who
felt thus at Victor Daley’s death?
They dare to write about the man
That they have never seen:
The blustering false Bohemian
That you have never been ;
Some with the false note in their voice,
And with the false tear shed,
Who in their secret heart rejoice
, For one more rival — dead....
They slander you, fresh in the sand,
They slander me alive.. . .
Because we would not crawl to them,
Their hands we would not shake.
Bcause their greed we would condemn,
Their bribes we would not take..'. .
Yet. happily. Lawson’s humor, when he
will allow it, can soften his bitterness.
And his patriotic verses are as good as
any now being written here. Yet he can
sink to prose like this, in “Australia’s
Peril”
Make farms fit to live on. build workshops
and technical schools for your sons;
Keep the wealth of the land in Australia —
make your own clotlf, machines and
guns! {
His verses to Daley, in spite of their
bitterness, have intimate touches of remin-
iscence and humor that could come only
from Lawson. It is true tliaT herein Law-
son echoes himself, yet the echo is useful in
recalling the great shout that gave it birth.
That is the penalty of fame: a man must
not fall below his best.

Fiction
Triangles of Life•, and Other Stories
(Standard Co., Melb.), reprinted from The
Bulletin, show us a familiar Henry Law-
son, a little tired. There is always some
touch in a Lawson sketch that puts the
Lawson brand on it —some bit of realism
shot through by a suggestion of romance.
For instance, haphazard, this: “Down the
hard road to the crossing at Pipeclay Creek
sounded the footsteps of a man. Not the
crunching steps of an English laborer, clod-
hopping contentedly home; these sounded
more like the footsteps of one pacing steadily
to and fro. and thinking steadily and hope-
lessly—sorting out the past.” How that laSit
phrase lifts a bit of observation to poetry !
But in these stories there is a carelessness of
structure that looks like criminal negligence.
His longer narratives ramble instead of pro-
gressing. Once by this method Lawson used
to build up an atmosphere; that was its
legitimate excuse. Now he merely rambles.
In his briefer sketches there are still his
quiet humor and his quieter pathos. In-
teresting, but a little dull.
These novelists are shrewd business men.
Arnold Bennett and Oliver Onions are the
new captains of fictional industry. There is
now no demand for the old three-volume
novel; yet that form of fiction had for the
author its advantages. He need provide
only one plot for some 400,000 words, and
the extra amount of writing was compen-
sated for by the larger price received for his
book. With the reduction in size and price
of novels, the author had to think out three
plots and three sets of characters for prac-
tically the same money. It occurred to
Bennett and Onions that, having taken all
the trouble to invent a popular plot, it
would be a safe speculation to utilise that
plot and the characters with which their
authors had got familiar for two other vol-
umes. Thus the author would be two plots
and" two sets of characters to the good for
the same number of words. The result of
this business scheme is shown in Bennett’s
Clayhanger and Hilda Lessways —the third
volume is ' not yet published ; and in Oliver
Onions’ In Accordance with the Evidence,
The Dehit Account and The Story of Louie
fßell, per Dymock's Library and Sydney
Book Club). Both authors proceed in the
same way. The story is told in the first
book from the viewpoint of one of its char-
acters, and in the second and third volumes
the same series of events is re-told as they
appeared to other characters. Thus we get.
as it were, the same march of events from
three independent angles—and it is remark-
able how different the same situations ap-
pear when the authors change the person-
ality of the onlooker. Thus in Clayhanger,
Hilda was always a mysterious person,
since we were envisaging her with the eves
of the man who loved her. In Hilda Less-
ivays, the woman loving, it was Clayhanger
who became mysterious. So with Onions.
His first volume showed us a London clerk,
Jeffries, who murdered a rival in love and
was not discovered. His second volume
told us, from another viewpoint, of his
marriage with the girl and his subsequent
life and death. The third volume retells the
whole story as it appeared to a girl named
Louie, who loved Jeffries even when she
found out that he was a murderer. It was
her influence that ultimately drove that
superman to his death. In the previous books
Louie was a minor character ; but here* die
becomes the heroine, and, incidentally, dis-
places from that position in our minds the
woman whom the murderer married. Her
story is a most interesting one. her char-
acter, now that it is filled out from the
incomplete sketch that appeared in the pre-
vious volumes, is a piece of subtle
psychology. As a separate novel The Story
of Louie is of absorbing interest: as the
conclusion of a brilliant three-volume novel.
it raises the book to a higher level of
artistry. Oliver Onions is a novelist already
reaching to a comparison with the few
great writers of modern English fiction. Of
course, there is no reason why he should
not give us the same murder-story over again
in a fourth novel: there are several of the
characters in that story that might want
to tell us how it struck them. We 11....
this critic will turn eagerly to the fourth
volume. .. .and the fifth.
J*
Reginald Wright Kauffman, author of
that convincing and unsensational study of
white slavery. Daughters of Ishmael,
depicts with the same sincerity another
aspect of the sex problem in The Sentence
of Silence (Bell, yer Dymock’s Library).
Ilis theme is the ignorance, not innocence,
of sex in which parents bring up their chil-
dren.
“Parents still go about pretending that
the world is the same to-day as it was yes-
terday ; while all the time the change is
here. We go about pretending that nobody
knows what everybody practices. We edu-
cate, or we make a more or less cloudy at-
tempt to educate, our daughters and sons to
face life: and yet we never say one word
to. them about the very fact of life itself.
We send them out., our loved and cherished,
the souls and bodies that we’ve tied our
hopes to —send ’em out to meet the greatest,
the strongest force in human nature, utterly
ignorant, utterly unprepared.”
The story of Dau is the story of a youth
brought up under the sentence of silence.
Through ignorance he stumbles through the
sort of life led by, perhaps, the majority of
young men; and at the end he meets and
gradually learns to love a woman whose
charm is her sincerity and her knowledge
of the facts of life. The book is cast in the
form of a tragedy, yet the boy frees himself
from the thrall of his numerous “affairs”
with disreputable women, apparently little
the worse, and in the end wins the one
woman. The happy ending arrives with the
usual weddiug—and in one brief, shattering
paragraph comes tragedy. The woman he
had just married explains dn puzzled won-
derment and fear. “I thought you knew. I
told you ; I thought you understood. What
have I been? Nothing that you’ve-mot been.
What right have you to ask?”
Grant Hervey in reply
The screed subjoined is either a sermon
or an ad., or, maybe, just plain Grantaus-
tralian. As we have flung a few adjectives
at the Rev. Hervey, the pulpit is his for 15
minutes: —
When I began to try my hand at the apostle
business, I was aged 18. That was about 15 years
ago, and I was born at Casterton, Victoria, in Octo-
ber, 1880 : therefore I’m still on the pleasant side of
33. At that prehistoric time—the period when my
first chunk of manuscript fell upon the desk of The
Bulletin —I was breaking pig-iron in a Melbourne
foundry ; doing it cheerfully, with the business end
of a 381 b. sledge-hammer. As a certain foreman
blacksmith once said, after our ancient steam-
hammer had burst its jacketing, and had made me
tl»e residuary legatee of its vigorous job, I was Hot
Stuff on a big weld. I remember that that same
steam-hammer stood there in a semi-dismantled con-
dition for months afterwards, simply because I was
there in a leathern apron and greasy dungarees, pre-
pared to take nine falls out of the biggest forging
that came along. The Australian manufacturer was
mostly a sweat-greedv, short-sighted fool about that
period; and would rather use up a strong man or
two, and then throw him on the industrial scrap-
heap, than spend a few pounds upon a damaged
machine. There are some manufacturers in this
country who haven’t got past that aboriginal stage
of mental development even yet.
Well, one day I hammered out that First Bit of
Verse, already alluded to, and sent it to The
Bulletin. I think that was before the “Red Page”
was invented. Anyway, it was shortly before the
South African War; so. having posted the screed
with a sweaty hand in South Melbourne, I kept on
hitting the pig-iron and waited for the Editorial
Echo. When it came, one fine and cheerful Thurs-
day afternoon, it arrived exactly like this: “G.H.:
GO AND DROWN YOURSELF?’ Now, that was
scarcely encouraging. In fact, any ordinary Nice,
Tame Little Poet, with a maiden aunt in Malvern
and a right-thinking male parent doing a roaring
rag-business in The Lane, would have been dis-
tinctly shocked. One or two worthy poets that I
know—-T. B. O’Hara, for instance—-would have died
of grief. But I didn't die. There MAY be those
who regret my survival, such is the depravity of
human nature; hut my sudden death just then, a la
John Keats and the Edinburgh Review, would have
been inconvenient to my boss. You see, the nasty,
dirty, uproarious, horribly unpoetical steel Jehannum
of a shop where I tore my crust out of the universe
had just obtained a contract for a lot of electric-
lighting machinery, and I was wanted. And so I
bathed my Wounded Feelings in the slack-tub, which
was large enough to cool-off a ship’s stern-framing,
and resolved to live.
Also, I resolved that editors didn’t know every-
thing—a resolution that I have never seen any cause
to alter. Clearly, if the then editor of The Bul-
letin did hot understand the importance of encour-
aging an apostle who should go forth in book-form
and preach the gospel of a Big Australia, it was
my duty to complete his education. So I resolved
to he kind, but firm, and commenced that contract
right away.
The then editor proved a very refractory pupil,
lie simply WOULD NOT learn. And vet the pains
that I took were prodigious. Receiving nothing hut
scorn and abuse per medium of the “Correspondence
Column,” it required much fortitude to hear up
beneath the burden of such a pupil. As German
Charlie, one of my shopmates and an able foreman
fitter, once remarked: “Py Chiminy! Dot plattv
Pullf.tin schall ged you into der platty Yarra
ge-mit, und der platty gontract schall haf to wait
for your tamn funeral ge-sprache!”
Nevertheless, 1 kept on. And alter i|„, .

the eyes at least of German Charlie—mv First m

to appear, I loomed larger than Goethe, Schille
and Schopenhauer. One night at the Melh™,; 1

1 remember that it was an early ' exhortation on
England’s changing naval policy, and that it ore
dieted the building of an independentlv-owned Auk
tralian fleet—Charlie made his prophecy • “pt

pewter barrow-load of beer, “py Chiminy i Vo

Well, my dear Australian brethren at Home and

It is not as good as I would like it to be, but per
haps I shall improve. Anyway, the publisher-man
has paid me in advance for the privilege of making
a book of it, under the prophetic title of Australians
Yet. And now, if German Charlie is still one of
The Bulletin’s readers—the last I heard of him he
was boss of the air-compressors on a Kalgoorlie
mine—if German Charlie will now rise up and send
me the address of his present gontract, he shall have
a special copy of my little book: For German
Charlie was the first Big-Australian saint to sit in
my congregation; and the Man Who Believes in
You When You Are Getting Swatted In the Eye is
worth a thousand of the sort who smile 10 or 15
years after, when they see you coming down the
steps of a bank.
Brethren, I have been preaching to you, off and
on, from this Bulletin pulpit for a number of years.
Occasionally I have wandered away and taken a look
at other cities and other seaports, but always I have
returned a lover of Sydney above all cities. Sydney
is going to be the next New York. I want to see it
made a city worthy of Australia—a city such as
Phidias and Pericles and Praxiteles, if were all
to step off the boat in a bunch, wouhj admire.
Melbourne is not a city—it is a Blot. Mel-
bourne can never be anything but a Blot, but Syd-
ney can become one of the shining glories of the
world. Australia wants ONE CITY to be its ever-
lasting pride—a city such as Yass-Can-Blowfly can
never be —and if all the people of Sydney will only
learn to Think Australian, then they will under-
stand that Sydney, before it can possibly become our
City of the Future, must become Australia’s city,
instead of remaining the merely greedy and parochial
capital of New South Wales.
The beauty of Sydney is the beauty of sailing
cloud and shimmering sea. And this, by association
of beauty with beauty, reminds me of my interest
in Australian women. Our women take off more
clothes in Sydney than they do in Wowsertarian
Melbourne ; even as all Catholic priests are forbirkle*
to attend the theatre in Melbourne, and, therefore,
invariably go to Sydney for their holidays. No
association inferred between these facts, if you
please. I simply want to say that I am a believer in
this fine, new type of Australian woman—the type
that our premier city of Sydney is evolving for us.
It is not clothes that are modest or immodest, and I
like these artistic, line-revealing modern fashions.
I believe that every man likes them, and hopes that
the rag-fashions of yesterday will never return. All
artists and lovers of beauty should write and defend
the present mode, and should hail and celebrate the
fact that the feminine form is now shown; express-
ing the hope that such celebration will lead women
to take care of their physical beauty and to learn
how to develop it. The Melbourne Wowser shrieks
that thin silk stockings are a Sin. Well, let him
shriek. Why should it he dreadful for a man to
know that there is good pink flesh beneath a woman's
stockings? What is wrong in being allowed to know
that women have legs, so long as those legs are
shapely? As the Archbishop of the Big Australians,
I wish to say that I believe in Legs. I want to see
the Australian woman get away from the horrible,
old, insanitary ideas of her British mother. I want
to see her become so alluring and so super-feminine,
so physically sound and gloriously clean that every
Big Australian in this whole wide continent will rise
up and demand such personal prosperity as will
enable him to marrv her. For marriage means More
Men to Defend the Nation ; therefore, when I become
First President of the Australian Republic, I shall
use Beautiful Legs and Shauelv Arms as a means of
attracting hither the Best White Manhood of Europe
and America.

CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
" / wish to give you a testimonial,
as I have benefited much by talcing
Clements Tonic. I was recommended
by a friend to try it; but I had tried
so many things that I did not have
any faith in it, but he persuaded me,
and told me if I did not get any
benefit from it he would pay the cost,
as it had cured him, of the same thing, Indigestion. I went to
two doctors over it, but only got temporary relief.
I am writing this to benefit anyone who is suffering from Indi-
gestion, as I consider it is a great blessing, and I ONLY TOOK TWO
BOTTLES, two years ago, and have had no sign of it returning since,
and I CAN EAT ANYTHING AND ENJOY THE BEST OF
HEALTH. A good MANY PEOPLE IN LITHGOW AND RYDAL
KNOW HOW I SUFFERED, and now I feel like a new man.
You can use this for any purpose you like, as I consider Clements
lonic a great blessing to anyone suffering as I did.

Every Woman Can Have
A PERFECT
BUST
It matters not if you have been thin and scraggly for years, even if you
never were properly developed your measurements can be increased to normal
and your figure nicely rounded out to pleasing, plump proportions. It is
done every day for others —why not you?
Mrs. B. Driesden wrote from Armidale, 25th May, 1913 :
“I do not require any more of Dr. Falliere’s Flesh-Food,
as I am developed as much as I desire. My measurements
have increased satisfactorily, and my health has improved
wonderfully, 1 will tell my friends of your treatment, and
will always recommend it, and I wish to thank you for your
kindness and prompt attention to my wants.”
Many oases gain as much as five pounds a week, and improvements up to as
have been made in bust measurements. Send or call for full particulars at once,

A Question of Time.
With happy lips that mock at time
a 1 sat beneath the trees.
eard . l beir branches whisper rhyme
hen tickled by the breeze —
Ihe sort of rhyme that hints at bliss
lake elfin echoes of a kiss.
like poppy petals red
_ T y-be happy summer throws--—^
With windy fingers on a bed
Beneath a sleeper’s nose,
Were such that sleeping or awake
My own red lips their-joy must take.
A thousand kisses in the dark
Seem but a single kiss,
They cause no scar, they leave no mark,
And yet the lips would miss
A single one-that went astray.
Or one so light it would not stay.-
The world that itches crowns to win—
Or half-crowns, failing such—
Is apt to hold that it is sin
When lips on warm lips touch—
In fact, it holds it very Wrong
In those to whom the lips belong.
Her lips did not belong to me
In the commercial sense ;
Yet, finding that their use was free
Tcould not hurry thence.
But ttrftiy own sweet use I reft
Their pleasant taste in open theft.
Perchance I stole five hundred, so
The rest I did not take ;
Many were given me I know,
My thirsty 'Soul to slake,
For she was generous and kind
And threw them round for me to find.
I did not lose a single kiss,
•But caught and kept them all;
Borne held a minute of pure bliss
.And some were crisp and small.
But for their very perfect taste
I did not let one go to waste.
The little stars played hide-and-seek
Among the leaves above,
The night was absolutely sleek
And velvet-soft for love,
And so the;happy time went by
Swift as the breathing of a sigh.
When Adarn found the new-made Eve
He did not know the time,
Nor did he want to, I believe.
For kissing was no crime.
Till in their noon of Paradise
They ate the peach and paid the price.
’Tis true I did not eat my peach,
But that old case to match,
The time was quite beyond my reach
For uncle had my watch.
And how was I to feel or know
The speed with which the moments go?
The lips that had been lent to me,
Or borrowed if you please.
Or stolen as the case may be,
My rapture to apfifiase,
As time is counted among men
Were wanted home at half-past ten
But when we started to return
We found the .wharf all dark.
Above we saw one hot star burn,
But there was naught to mark
The fact that any vessels plied
Across those waters waste and wide.
We saw at once that we were done-
We simply could not face
The city in to-morrow’s sun ;
So, weighted with disgrace.
We had gone hopelessly astray
And, kissed eight solid hours away.
’Twas purely on account of time
That everything went wrong.
If we had only heard a chime
Instead of that low song
Of waving branches we had known
The way the giddy hours had flown.
So there was nothing left to do
Except to sit and wait
Until the morning skies got blue
And sunshine filled the great.
Wide wonder of the kind old world
With various things that kissed and curled.
And as w r e could not then return
To face the city’s gaze.
We had to watch the slow sun burn
Down to the evening ways,
And then to wait till dark was slain
And morning called him up again.
The sun goes up, the sun goes down,
The boats flit to and fro,
But we can never go to town
To see the folk we know.
And so, forlorn, we linger here
And eat the shining atmosphere.
With kisses sweet we chase the day
And make the swift night fly.
The hurried morn can never stay
To wipe his dew-tears dry ;
While lip on scarlet lip will rhyme
We need not take account of time.

Inez.
Hot with old Spanish blood, her lips made
red
At f hat fine forge where Eros hammers
A glory of dark tresses round her head.
The grace of olden dances in her feet.
And eyes....the dusky wells where some
warm thought
Lies hid, in nets of dream and wonder
caught.
She touches we with fingers all so light
A fairy magic trembles in the tips.
Her breath is like white flowers that bloom
by night.
And in the rapture of her close-pressed ups
All this unfolded, reckless heart of mine
Sways to the kiss of God’s best-hoarded
wine.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
ipaper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
.care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

THE SERMON THAT WAS PREACHED
BACKWARDS.
The Federal estimates, presented a few
days ago by Treasurer Bigjohn Forrest,
include a vote for the construction of the
railway from Pine Creek in the Northern
Territory to Katherine River; so apparently
th» lamentable blunder of starting work at
the wrong end is really to be perpetrated.
'The Bulletin has written much on this
subject, and the importance of it is so vast
that it makes no apology for writing some
■more. In fact, it will make no apology even
if it writes a great deal more. The iailway
tto the Territory is the most urgent —or very
mearly the most urgent—public concern in
Australia. It ranks far ahead of the Wes-
fealiaD transcontinental line in a national
*ense, though it may not be so immediately
profitable. Even on this point, however,
tjherifi is no complete certainty. It is re-
quired to bring settlers, who are also de-
fenders, to the emptiest part of Australia,
amd the part which is handiest for Asiatic
lt is needed so that it will be
possible to send troops from the one fairly
populous corner which Australia possesses
to the region which is most liable to want
troops, and which is, at present, least likely
to get them. And it is a matter of urgency,
because the Commonwealth owns a vast,
rich property which doesn’t pay for axle-
grease through lack of communication; a
few of the grandest rivers in Australia,
which yield no dividend because there is no
traffic for them to carry and no wheels for
them to turn; and two bits of railway
which are a dead loss because they end in
the middle and dead end of nowhere. By
reason of these matters the Commonwealth
has so much less money' wherewith to buy
guns, and so much less population to pay
for guns and to carry them. The develop-
ment of the great Northern property should
be a thing of haste, and judging by the
Budget of Cook’s large and prosperous-
looking Treasurer the Cook Government
has an eye upon the fact. It isn’t any
great quantity of eye, but it is a trifle of
eye to go on with —probably as much as
can be spared from the weary job of watch-
ing out against the incessant absence of
Bruce Smith when a division is called for.
Still, many a good work can be spoiled
by being done in the wrong way, and this
is a case in point. A sermon is supposed
to be beneficial, but a sermon shouldn’t be
preached backwards. A well is a great in-
stitution in a dry land, but no well that is
dug from the bottom upwards amounts to
much. A watchdog has points about him
in ordinary circumstances, but a watchdog
that rushes at the burglar the wrong way,
and attacks him with his tail, is inefficient.
The same may be said of the house whereof
the roof is built first, and has to be sup-
ported by balloons pending the arrival of the
lower premises and the importation of the
cellar. All these are instances of more or
less value, for the commencement of the
Territory railway from the northern end is
an exactly similar mistake. It is the sort
of blunder that Columbus would have made
if he had tried to find the so-called New
World by starting from New Orleans _ in-
stead of Cadiz, and sailing with the hind-
quarters of his fleet in front.
The essential, as already mentioned, is to
connect the Territory with the two or three
congested cities of the South which have a
little population, and consequently a. few
defenders to spare—to break up the isola-
tion and emptiness which are the result of
vast sea-distances and lack of markets. One
hundred miles of railway built from Oodna-
datta northward will make the first railway
connection between the Territory and Ade-
laide, Melbourne and Sydney. It will make
accessible the tail end, at least, of the table-
land, for most of the dry stretch has
already been bridged by the Port Augusta-
Oodnadatta line. After the boundary has
been crossed, every mile of new rail that is
laid will open up a bit more of the Pro-
mised Land —the one great area of Middle
Australia where the rainfall is fairly steady,
and the evaporation is small, and the nights
are cool, and the mosquitoes are few, and
even the maddest Tory dare not get off his
chest the gag that “the white man can’t
live.” And every mile of new railway will
mean one mile less of country which may
be invaded with impunity because it is cut
off from any assistance which the big
centres of population can afford.
On the other hand the Government which
builds its railway from the north down to-
wards the bottom of the map makes for the
time —that is, until the work is finished—a
pathway for the possible enemy. At present,
if a powerful and objectionable foreign
creature captured Port Darwin, he would
find himself in command of 145 miles of
track with which to carry his troops into
the interior. If another 800 miles of the
same- substance were built at that end, he
would find himself kindly and obligingly
furnished with 945 miles of line to help
him to annex the interior, in consequence
of which he would find it easy to annex a
lot more interior. Whereas 100 miles of
railway development from the south would
begin to connect the Territory with the old,
big cities, and to break up the isolation of
the Hermit Province, it would take some
1000 miles of railway-building from the
north to produce the same effect. The
sermon is the same, but the benefit may be
lost by preaching the discourse backward.
Even 800 miles of new line, built south-
ward from the Pine Creek terminus, might
not make a single acre of the Territory any
more easy of defence so far as the present
great centres of population are concerned,
but that method of construction might make
a present of many millions of good acres to
the thief who came by sea in the night.
So the patriotic theory is that the trans-
continental railway should hurry northward
from Oodnadatta. spreading out tentacles —
which will be really entrenchments or forti-
fications —east and west as it goes, to con-
nect with Sydney, Brisbane, Townsville and
the ports of northern Westralia. Thus the
space which could be commanded by an
enemy who had secured control of the ocean
would grow less every day, and the space
which could be commanded by an Aus-
tralian army —if Australia has sense enough
to maintain a thoroughly efficient army—
would become larger every day. The area
which depended wholly for its defence on
the little Australian fleet would diminish,
and the area for the defence of which the
fleet and army could co-operate would grow.
There would be no great isolated railway
system in the North which an invader could
seize and employ for his own purposes. The
habit of leaving lines lying about where, on
a great emergency, we can’t get at them
while the other party can is no wiser than
would be a similar habit of leaving guns or
money lying about. The only article be-
longing to Australia which should be need-
lessly deposited in the Port Darwin district
while that harbor is in its present unpro-
tected condition is the Public Debt. That
(praise be to Heaven!) can be left loose on
the shore anywhere. Incidentally the at-
tack on the problem from the south implies
getting .a lot more railway for the money.
It means construction at South Australian
wages and expense rates, which will be
fairly moderate, because the workers will
have two big cities behind them as sources
of supply, and a Federal railway to carry
their goods at cost. On the other hand,
expansion from the north must involve work
done at the exorbitant rates charged in an
isolated and banished community, situated
at the end of an immensely long sea-route
over which Private Enterprise has full
control.
* * * *
The ruinous and unpatriotic idea of re-
suming the construction of the transcon-
tinental railway at the foolish end rather
than at the wise one is a political com-
promise. It is the work of men who fear
to make up their minds lest by so doing
they may lose their jobs and their twopence, l '
According to the terms of the agreement
under which over 500,000 square miles be-
came a Federal property the Port Augusta-
Poft Darwin railway is to be finished. And
seeing that the Commonwealth owns the
Territory, and must needs develop its pos-
session if it wants to make any money out
of it, the building of this work right through
the great Federal area seems reasonable.
But a section of the community, in Queens-
land, N.S.W. and Victoria, wants the
Government to break faith with South Aus-
tralia, and leave the bulk of the Territory
undeveloped and useless, and build a steel
track from Port Darwin into the Eastern
States. There are votes to be lost in the
Middle and West by taking the line east,
and there are votes to be lost in the East
by looking strictly after the interests of
Australia and sticking to the centre. Poli-
ticians hate to lose votes, though the mer-
cenary struggle for them is often an ill-
paving business. An old-time crowd of
Federal Laborites abandoned the proposed
Australian capital on the Snowy River,
with its magnificent water supply and
water-power, in favor of the low flats and
stagnant waters of Canberra, in order to
purchase the support of Sydney, and it got
its reward, for it was thrown out with
ignominy. It got in again, and the end of
its second period of office was largely
brought about by Sydney. Still the desire
to acquire votes, or to steer a shady middle
course in the hope of not losing them, ap-
pears to be incurable.
The section from Pine Creek to the Kath-
erine is about all that can be built without
awaking the sleeping hound of State Rights.
So far there will only be applause from the
unthinking multitude. South of the Kath-
erine the eggs and hoots will begin. The
fact that a good deal of applause is likely
to come also from Japan is unfortunate,
but in the struggle to be non-committal
misfortunes will occur. In this matter the
Cook party is very like the Fisher party,
and the Fisher gang presents a dreadful
resemblance to the Cook crowd. Each is
willing to sell a great national interest for
the sake of public approyal. And they have
got so little of it that one is in office with-
out power, and the other is out of office
without salary. The approval was so
equally divided that neither got enough of it
to live on.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The N.S.W. Vaccination Bill.
For plain, dull-brown futility there was
nothing in the record of the N.S.W. session
that deserved a larger leather medal than
the Compulsory Vaccination Bill. If the
leather medal had been as big as the case
called for there would have been enough
material in it to set up a boot factory. In
the first place, nobody now living—much
less anybody now grown up—was to be com-
pulsorily vaccinated. As the last person
now above ground in the Ma territory may
live for another years, that meant post-
poning any serious effort at the obliteration
of the disease till some time after the year
2000. The year 2000 is a long way off, and
if by any chance the solar, system gets off
the plumb, and the world, while skirting
the sharp corner of a patch of asteroids,
bumps against a perfectly new heavenly
body, the year 2000 may never arrive at
all. Next, the Government lacked the cour-
age to make the parent pay for tl*e vaccina-
tion of his child, though that is As essential
an act of cleanliness as the washing of the
child, and the parent has to pay for
child washing. The penalties for fail-
ure to vaccinate were whittled down till at
last an agreement was reached by which,
after a cranky father had paid £5 in fines,
he could be prosecuted no further, and his
child might be exposed to the horrors of
one of the worst diseases oh earth
without anybody interfering on its behalf.
Apparently nobody cared a straw for the
welfare of the child, and all the anxiety
was for the cranky father. Finally the
Holman Government decided that it
wouldn’t put its weight and influence be-
hind even the remaining futile shred of its
own measure, and it made the question a
non-party one. Under Party Government
nobody has much interest in non-party
questions, and members promptly go out to
see a girl about a cat, or something of the
sort. And while a girl is drawing a pint of
tortoiseshell cat in a pewter anything may
happen. What happened was that, by a
very mixed vote, the Vaccination Bill went
out on the third reading, and the proposal
to really clean up Sydney died of inanition.
Yet small-pox is a sufficiently terrible com-
plaint to justify extraordinary precautions.
It hasn’t attacked Sydney this time in a
virulent form because there has been so
much voluntary vaccination on the spot,
and because a fairly large number of the
people are new arrivals from countries
where vaccination is compulsory. But if a
spirit of cheerful contempt for the disease
takes possession of the community, and vac-
cination falls into disuse, there is no reason
to doubt that the horror is waiting round
in the next street, and feeling as good as
ever. In older days it killed the clean and
the unclean, the poor and the rich, the well-
fed king and the ill-fed peasant with equal
cheerfulness. It emptied six important
European thrones within 80 years—petty
nrinces and subsidiary potentates died so
freely of it that they weren’t worth count-
ing. " It wiped out, in the middle of last
century, more than one-third of an army
100.000 strong, and did it in about a
year, despite the fact that it was a' well-
paid, well-fed and well-cared-for army. It
attacks the unborn child, wfeieWmay recover
from the illness in the womb and be born
alive —yet a blind, shapeless horror that
would "be better dead. And in the later
days, before vaccination got the plague
down and sat on its head, it had begun to
spread from humans to sheep, and to make
the meat uneatable and the wool a som
of death. It is a sort of fashion nowadays
to scoil at vaccination as unnecessarv h
cause small-pox, by reason of vaccinating
is at present a matter of
small account. In the same way the in
habitants of a walled city set in the middle
of savages might decide that their lk
were superfluous, because the savages t
by reason of these walls, had left off hr,« l
tili ties. Or in similar fashion, because
drainage has practically killed off certain
diseases in certain Australian cities it
might be claimed that drains should now
be regarded as a needless and expensive
precaution. What threatens to discredit
vaccination is its success.
Government by Slander and Assault.
The closing days of the 22nd Parliament of
N. S. Wales were disfigured by a couple of
incidents that should do a lot of good in
the way of satisfying the electors as to the
inherent disreputableness and futility of the
Party system. C. G. Wade’s attack on
Works Minister Griffith would never have
been made in the way it was made under
any other form of government. Griffith
was accused of dishonesty, in connection
with land transactions in half a dozen dif-
ferent parts of the country. The establish-
ment of any one of the charges would have
n.eant that Griffith was so unfit for public
life as to be a menace to the State that
employed him. They were none of them
related in the remotest degree. Griffith’s
allegedly corrupt land speculations at Nar-
rabeen, and his reputedly dishonest efforts in
connection with the Suspension Bridge and
the Uhr’s Point transactions, had no more
to do with (say) the Medlow Bath matter
than surf-bathing has to do with polar ex-
ploration. Each of the six charges was
capable of proof or disproof, as the case
might be, without reference to any of the
others. The Medlow Bath matter contained
the suspicion of an element that had nothing
to do with Ministerial probity. C. G.
Wade seized on it and placed it before
all the others. Sydney Sunday Times,
which is nothing if not anti-Labor, put the
position with ruthless fairness as follows:
Why is Mr. Wade so anxious to press this matter
that he will sink all the rest, and why, also, is the
Government reluctant, even to refusal, to allow this
charge to be investigated? There are no satisfac-
tory answers to either of these questions, and the
public is driven to the conclusion that there is
something behind this Medlow matter which might
only be brought out by cross-examination in a wit-
ness-box. This much is certain, that if this charge
cannot be publicly made it is not one that concerns
the public.
That is how the thing appeals to decent-
minded folks w!k> are outside party politics.
But to actual players of the unsavory game
such a point of view is absurd. They accept
it as a contest in which thimble-rigging,
biting, kicking, marking the cards, and vil-
lainy and thieving generally are engaged in
as a matter of course. By virtue of long
usage a man is enabled to do that in party
politics which in private life would get him
barred from the society of his friends for
ever. Contemporaneously, more or less, with
Wade’s refusal to proceed with his corrup-
tion charges against Griffith, on the
ground that he had been precluded from
dealing with one of them, there occurred
the Moxham-McGirr fight. On this occa-
sion the middle-aged Liberal and the youth-
ful Laborite went to the library of the
Assembly, and in the presence of many of
the members and two policemen, fought till
they had had enough. The two incidents
put a fitting cap on the 14 censure motions
of the past few months and on the flood of
slander and blasphemy which has been
poured out on the floor of the Assembly
during the same time. None of these weari-
some and time-wasting and disgraceful im-
becilities would have occurred had the coun-
try been run on business lines. There is no
commercial concern on earth that could
stand the strain of having its governing
directors perpetually delving into each
other’s private lives, on the off-chance of
finding out something of a frivolous nature;
and in the intervals calling one another liars
and thieves, and hampering each other’s
operations in every way imaginable. How
much longer is Australia going to endure the
spectacle of its various Parliaments being
turned into places where insulting and dis-
gusting language, free fights and criminal
slanders are recognised uncomplainingly as
part of the ordinary business of government?
Or to put it another way: How long will it
be before the electors declare for the aboli-
tion of the system of government which is
to blame for these offences, by the introduc-
tion of elective Ministries?
«
Jervis Bay and “the People.”
There is something about the atmosphere
of the N.S.W. Legislative Council that
makes men who, under ordinary conditions,
are public-spirited and gifted with horse
sense, talk like the inmates' of a lunatic
asylum. The other night, when the ceding
of certain lands at Jervis Bay to the Com-
monwealth was being discussed, some amaz-
ing piffle was let loose. Of course when the
ancient Dangar said he opposed the cession,
as nothing would ever reconcile him to
Federation, and the whole thing was a dark
conspiracy against N.S.W., nobody was
surprised. But when the same nonsense is
talked by a man like Alt.en Taylor, who>
outside the Council chamber,_ is a man o
large views and progressive ideas,_ and nas
done the community some service, it is piti-
ful. Said Taylor :
Practically the whole of the bay i s heing
for, along with other tracts of land. I bell PU
should do nothing to hamper the Federal “ , th
ment in its efforts to provide for the defence o
Commonwealth. In doing that, however, we
not lose sight of the people’s rights.
Now what is the Commonwealth but tne
People, the whole People and nothing m
the People? Does Allen Taylor think: t«
Commonwealth is a foreign power. »
isn’t it the first right of the people to Haw
the defence of their country, lives and pr
perty provided for? Or does Apia* '
regard the people as consisting one (
small crowd of capitalists who would
grow rich oh the unearned incremen: ,
from the Federal Government s exp
at Jervis Bay? The people for whose rigid
Allen Taylor has such regard nave
cided on an adequate naval defence s .'
They have elected certain men to car
out. They have given those men the P
to acouire any lands or property nee >
military and naval purposes. me

“practically the whole of Jervis Bay” is re-
quired for naval defence purposes ; and who

says he is so anxious to safeguard?
The Color Line.
The Ceylon Morning Leader has been get-
ting excited and protesting vigorously
against the invitation issued to a team of
Australian cricketers to visit the island,
Australia having drawn the color-line and
therefore “affronted” Ceylon. “If it were
a question of purity of race,” says the
curried Leader, “there might be a reason-
able objection to colored immigration; but
this prohibition is directed against the in-
flux of cheap labor.” And therein the
curried Leader is 95 per cent, wrong.
Thirty years ago, when Australia didn’t
know a quarter as much about colored labor
as it does to-day, it thought that sort of
labor was cheap ; now it knows it isn’t. It
has proved that much in the sugar busi-
ness, wherein white labor is giving the em-
ployers vastly more profit than ever yellow
or brown did. And in the tin districts'white
labor, with machinery, is making profits
out of ground that the “cheap” Chow aban-
doned years ago. Finally, the one part of
Australia that lias made no progress what-
ever is the Northern part, where there was
more of this “cheap” labor than anywhere
else in the Commonwealth. So only 5 per cent,
of the Australian objection to colored immi-
gration now rests on the cheap-labor foun-
dation, and that foundation is the only part
of the whole business that is unsound ; the
other 95 per cent, is based on the fact that
the British-Australian race is a white, race,
with white morals and white modes of liv-
ing, a..d it can’t keep white if it admits the
colored foreigner. At bottom is the dread of
the half-breed. How would Ceylon itself
regard a mixture of, say, Cingalee and
Hottentot?
The Overseas Club Foolishness.
English estimates of the attractions of the
Overseas Club give artless expression to the
“imperialism” which is grounded in insular
ignorance. Last week copies of the Daily
Mail came in thousands to Australia, ad-
dressed to members of the Overseas Club,
exhorting them to feed their “imperial”
minds by subscribing to that pushful little
journal. Evidently the Daily Mail regards
the ridiculous Club as a growing force in
these latitudes, whereas it is actually doomed
to perish of cold neglect. In Melbourne,
where the proportion of British-born is much
larger than in Sydney, there has not been
the least enthusiasm for the Overseas Club
idea since its original local supporters began
to understand what sort of brotherhood they
had let themselves in for. Considered as a
mere matter of common interest to Aus-
tralians who are shut out of the A.N.A. —
such as Andrew Fisher, for instance —the
Overseas Club seemed to compare favorably
with the more clannish Caledonian, Hiber-
nian and Cambrian associations ; but when it
revealed itself as an unprotected, piebald
society .to which any bounder could beleng
by paying a shilling or two per annum, or
to which lie could say he belonged whilst
paying nothing at all, the awful absurdity of
the scheme repelled all intelligent sympathy.
Australians who took it up in the first in-
stance, therefore, dropped it like a hot saus-
age. The original honorary office-holders
found themselves expected to hold out the
right hand of fellowship to a motley pro-
cession of immigrants and globe trotters
arriving from distant parts of the Hempire,
on the understanding that the O.C. was a
sort of huge Masonic lodge or labor agency.
These deluded newchums hoped to get a
billet and borrow lialf-a-crown to go on with
as soon as they struck the figureheads of a
beastly kawlonial branch. Moreover, tinted
aliens had been advised to buy the little
bauble of membership when they booked
their passage for Australia; they hung
it on their watch-chain accordingly. It was
the new English recipe for fortune-making
at the far end of that glorious Empire
whereon the sun never sets. No bounder
could be properly equipped without it. So,
even though the Overseas Club had no other
stains upon its character, its easy accessi-
bility to bounders must obviously prove
fatal. If sentiment were trying to keep the
plant alive (which Anglo-Australian senti-
ment certainly isn't trying to do at this
end) the parasites would inevitably kill it.
Private Enterprise on Its Defence.
On October 2, The Bulletin, reviewing
the reports of the State-owned factories at-
tached to the Defence Dept., accepted them
as. further evidence that Private Enter-
prise’s claim to superiority was some-
what premature. Now, comes a letter from
the Adelaide firm of llolden and
Frost claiming that Private Enterprise can
make out a better case in regard, at any
rate, .to military saddlery. Herewith the
essentials of the communication :
In the report of the Federal factory quantities are
supplied of the articles mentioned in The Bulle-
tin. and we include them in this calculation. The
prices which we quote are prices at which we are
prepared to supply to-day. The probability also, as
you point out, is, that with quantities and greater
knowledge, we, equally with the factory, would be
able to supply at still lower figures. As the matter
stands, on the quantities given in the factory report.
The Bulletin figures showed that the factory had
produced at a total of £638 18s. 4d below Private
Enterprise. On figures we append herewith, the
difference is only £35 14s. Bd:

Suppose we take a few more lines. For in-
stance :

Saddles, steel arch. . 3109 40/9 38/11
So, on the lines of saddles (above), Private Enter-
prise is shown to be £284 19s. lOd. below factory
costs.
There are a good many points in the report which,
we think, you, with The Bulletin’s noted accuracy
in all matters of figures, should point out.
One is, that the auditor reports that this balance-
sheet is made up on an estimated value of stock in
hand ; and, furthermore, that the report of the Secre-
tary of Defence, which is published at the commence-
ment, states that “Buildings, Machinery, Plant, etc.,
have been subject to various rates of depreciation’’ ;
but these rates of depreciation do not correspond.
I or instance—Buildings are given at £3612 14s. Bd.
and 5 per cent, depreciation as £62 10s. The
same with the other depreciations. The figures ap-
pear to need explanation. As depreciation on
machinery and plant, 13 per cent, is given. These
assets total £1874 4s. 4d., yet the amount written
off is only £39 19s. 7d., which is only about 2 per
cent, instead of 13 per cent.
One big factor in the comparison of values is, of
course, the quality of the goods supplied. It is not
for us to say whether our goods are better than the
factory products, or not; but we think a report
could be obtained. Another very important matter
which should likewise be cleared up is in regard to
the amount of machine work which is put into vari-
ous parts of the harness in the harness factory, and
the hand work which the Private Enterprise contrac-
tors have to put in. The amount, in this direction,
comes to a very serious item indeed in favor of Pri-
vate Enterprise, if we were allowed to use machine
work on the same basis as the factory.
It seems almost an idle boast to say that we are
quite prepared to make the harness and requirements
for the military authorities on an all-round average
of 10 p.c. lower than factory costs, and will guaran-
tee that the quality shall be better.
However, the matter can never be adjusted by
newspaper correspondence; and, if a public inquiry
can be made into the whole matter, in which the
contractors could have an opportunity of using their
special knowledge, we feel quite sure that we could
more than prove the position which we have taken.
The Bulletin did not set out to give an
auditor’s report on the factory statement of
operations. It took the manager’s word
for the disabilities under which the infant
establishment was working, and was then
highly interested to discover an appendix to
the report showing how, in spite of the dis-
abilities, the average factory cost of pro-
duction compared with the average contract
prices during the same period. On the list
of 30 articles quoted, there were 24 where
the factory price was lower than P.E.’s price,
one article where the two ran a dead heat,
and five where P.E. was cheaper that Sosh.
According to Holden and Frost, the total
advantage to Sosh on the few lines of goods
(seven out of 30) quoted in The Bulletin
was only £35 : but what contractor’s figures
are being used in that comparison this paper
does not know. Some of them differ materi-
ally from those shown in the appendix to
the factory report. The totalling of a few
stray lines doesn’t provide a very valuable
comparison, anyhow; but what there is to
it (£35) is, on the calculations of Holden
and Frost, to be credited to Sosh.

Because the State won’t do it, and there
is no Greater Sydney authority that can do
it, a little group of doctors, headed by the
veteran Philip Sydney Jones, is trying to
get enough money into a company to estab-
lish hygienic dairies somewhere near the
place where the House adjourns to watch its
members fight in the library. The small
beginnings of a dairy are already run by
these doctors ; but there isn’t the capital to
either run the business economically or
supply more than an odd customer here and
there. And, until some public authority
takes over the whole supply, and puts the
control of it into the hands of people who
know that dirt isn’t good for milk, and
saves about two-thirds of the present cost
of distribution, and at least one-third of
the racketing which the milk gets, the busi-
ness never will be satisfactory. Naturally,
Dr. Sydney Jones being this State’s chief
campaigner against the white plague, the
little company, which is pluckily trying to
do what some public authority ought to do,
attaches most importance to the supply of
pure milk —not merely milk containing so-
and-so of butter fat, but milk that isn’t a
whole zoo of ravening microbes. As the
report of the Tuberculosis Advisory Board,
presented to the N.S.W. Parliament a while
ago, said, “dirt-contaminated, manure-
polluted and bacteria-laden milk can be re-
tailed so long as its chemical composition is
at least equal to the standard _ adopted,
which is certainly not high.... Milk below
the chemical standard may not be harmful.
Milk grossly laden with bacteria may be,
and generally is, prejudicial to. health.”
This report was presented to Parliament, in
terms of the' commission issued to the Boa-rd ;
but it wasn’t over the wholesale murder
disclosed that members got so excited that
they punched noses in the Parliamentary
library. Why , should Parliament get ex-
cited about such a matter? The victims
are mostly infants, and infants haven’t got
Votes.
The Yic. Railways are up against the ab-
surdity of Melbourne’s restricted Sunday
suburban train service. The Dept, is sup-
p’ying extra forenoon trains to some of the
country beauty spots, and is prepared to
sunply more; but under the present law sub-
urban folk can hardly get into Princes
Bridge to catch these trains, save by walk-
ing , and as only “church” trains into town
are ’permitted on the suburban lines, reason-
ably early “excursions” from town are out
of the question. For which anomaly the
great god Wowser is responsible —the great
god who finds desecration of the Sabbath,
and infringement of Labor’s Day of Rest,
in every train-service except the particular
one which he pses himself. Thus far the
local Labor party has supported him in his
policy of Sunday-joy suppression; but now
that Labor has wages to spend in desecrat-
ing the Sabbath by trjps to the fern dis-
tricts, the party begins to perceive that
public-service workers can quite easily
secure a-rest-some other day.
The very last suggestion for holding a
“Day” is Trafalgar Day, about which a
letter recently apgjdared in a Sydney paper.
This business ! isu becoming so violent that
there will soon have to be two days every
day in order to make room for all the days.
Trafalgar was really a small scrap, as was
Waterloo. There were only 60 sailing ships
engaged, many of them rotten. The event
became famous partly through the signal
that Nelson hoisted, partly through .Nel-
son’s' death, and partly because it was the
last conspicuous howl of a long-dragged-
out naval war in which both paities grew
very poor and very tired. Waterloo was
famous in somewhat the same fashion. It
was the last flurry of a very great land war.
In the times when the combatants were
young and fresh it wouldn’t have looked like
more than a big skirmish, but when they
heaved up their last resources of human meat
for a final effort, it was’decisive. The last
battle at sea is always decisive, even if it is
a fight between a punt and a dredge. And
the last battle on land is the finish, though
there may be only a beadle and a cannon on
one side, and a consumptive and a dog on
the other. Incidentally, why not combine
all the “days” and call the occasion Dog
Day? It is alleged that every dog has one.

The full-powered Tory is not as numerous
as he used to be; but one of him cut loose,
the other day, in the columns of a Sydney
paper. He informed the editor, in a sort of
angry shout, that the Australian worker was
“too expensively housed and too lavishly fed
and clad.” Then, after denouncing him for
knocking off when the bell rang, the troglo-
dyte produced this: —
The incentive to save is destroyed by the prospec-
tive payment of the old age pension, and that fine,
rugged manhood and spirit of independence—once our
boast —have largely disappeared.
That writer, who represents the old school
which made much capital out of “fine,
rugged manhood” and “spirit,” can’t see that
the olden virtues are still on the premises;
the only difference is that the worker is
now making capital out of them for himself.
He is feeding and clothing himself better;
also he is more expensively
that isn’t his fault; the “fine, rugged man-
hood” of the property-owners is seeing to
that part of the business. As regards the
thriftlessness of the allegedly luxurious
worker, it is strange if this lover of good
living is spending everything he gets and
taking no heed of the future just because he
sees the old age pension dole ahead of him.
Even at long range, the pension doesn’t look
as glittering as all that; which no doubt
explains why £13,500,000 more money is
lodged in one N. S. Wales Savings Bank
alone than was there in 1901.
♦
Last week Sydney Labor Council, by re-
scinding a resolution in favor of a cost-of-
living commission, practically decided that
cost of living should not be the standard of
wages. The Labor Council is right; wages
shouldn’t be governed by what a man eats,
but by what he produces. The man who
consumes six meals a day and loafs six
hours out of the eight he is supposed to be
working shouldn’t be entitled to twice as
much as the other man who consumes only
three meals a day and does a fair thing all
his eight working hours. This country has
a dreadful lot of work to do, and the only
way it can get rich is by doing that work ;
and the sooner employers leave off cackling
so much about the cost of living the sooner
they will also be able to leave off cackling
about the slowing-down methods of the
working-man. If the worker is paid accord-
ing to what it costs him to live, why should
he work hard? It’s up to him in that case
merely to eat hard and drink hard and wear
silk socks.
“Bulkhead” : It may seem a distant howl
from the Titanic sinking in the Atlantic to
a barge floating on the Darling River, but
they are connected. When the British
Board of Trade was aroused by the Titanic
tragedy out of a 30 years’ sleep, it hurriedly
passed a new set of life-saving rules, one
of which was that all British ships must
provide a life-jacket for each person carried.
As every five-goatpower dug-out on the Dar-
ling is a British ship, and. as the Govern-
ment of N. S. Wales swallowed, holus
bolus, the Board’s panic legislation, it fol-
lows that a shearer, beer sparrer and even
bishop going from Bourke to Wentworth on
a wool hooker must be assured of a cork
waistcoat. When these rules came into
force it was calculated that the Ma State
would require 250,000 life-jackets, and, as
everv other portion of the Empire that had
gobbled the rules wanted tens of thousands
also, supplies couldn’t be got at once. Just
here the foolery of the business began to
gibber at the gangway and make remarks
like an idiot at the ticket office. Each
jacket costs 45., plus the expense of arrang-
ing its home on board, and this heavy out-
lay has frozen out some of the small steam-
boat men who have been running services
where the Sydney ferries monopoly, for in-
stance, doesn’t reach, such as Botany, Haw-
kesbury and the up-country rivers. But
the lunatic regulation which declines to
allow a commodious, staunch and bulk-
headed steamer to carry passengers unless
a dado of lifebelts is built round her, cheer-
fully permits a cramped, frail motor-launch
to crowd un with travellers, without asking
that one single lifebelt be on board, let alone
the rest of the life-saving outfit that the
steamers must provide. Motor-boats aren’t
even bulkheaded, which is the only real pro-
tection that harbor traffic can be given. If
a Manly boat with 1600 people runs into a
Mosman boat with 1400, the 3000 life-
jackets available won’t be nearly as useful
as the dozen bulkheads that the two steamers
possess between them. It’s a sort of
laughter-raising proposition when you
examine it, but hair-raising is likely to be
its chief end in life.

Westralian Chamber of Mines is wrathful
because Premier Scaddan proposes a Mines
Regulation Act to provide for (1) abolition
of underground night-shift, (2) abolition of
underground contract work, and (3) ap-
pointment by miners themselves of check in-
spectors. The Chamber says such things will
banish British capital and ruin the industry.
Yet two large Kalgoorlie companies, Great
Boulder and Lake View Consols, have volun-
tarily abandoned night-shift, just as the
Broken Hill Prop, did three years ago, so
that for eight hours each day the dust may
settle in the workings and the fume-laden air
be renewed. Also, it is found that men who
take their rest in the natural sleep-time can
do more toil; wherefore one way and another
the companies that work only two shifts are
the gainers. The abolition of contract work
is more debatable. Brolcep Hill miners, for
instance, though they struck against it once,
would strike still harder now if it weTe pro-
posed to abolish it. As a rule, it is the best
system for the workers when the demand for
labor is keen and the supply limited, and it
is the poorest when the market is glutte'd by
unorganised men willing to cut oae another’s
throats for a crust. As to the check inspec-
tors, all the world over they are employed in
coal mines, and only a Westralian Chamber
of Mines man could see why thev should not
be employed in metal mines. Broken Hill
has had the system for years; and, though
managers were restive under it at first, they
see now that it relieves them of a lot of awk-
ward responsibility regarding the safety of:
the workings.

There is a vast mass of local color in the
recently-circulated appeal on behalf of the
Veterans’ Home, located in the old battery
at Bare Island, which was constructed by
an allegedly Liberal Government of N. S.
Wales with borrowed money to defend
Botany Heads. For example :
Great Britain has established her hospitals—
Chelsea for the army, and Greenwich for the naval
veterans—and our sister State, Victoria, has a cre-
ditable veterans’ home —the United Service Home,
at Drysdale. .. .Surely Sydney will not allow her-
self to lag behind Victoria in helping the men who
are willing to help themselves.
Here we have (1) the dragging in of the
Ma-land, (2) the usual blighted ignorance
as to the real position in that distant spot.
Only the most extraordinary influence can
get a disabled soldier admitted to Chelsea
Hospital, while Greenwich Hospital was, in
1869, turned into a college for the higher
education of naval officers, and the old, dis-
abled sailors were pensioned off or sent to
the workhouse, according to circumstances.
At the present time Great Britain has only
one hospital of the sort proposed for Aus-
tralia, and it would have lost even that if
its managing Board had not been chargedl
with the working of the entire army-pensioni
system. The clarion call to “Sydney” (New/
South Wales is swept aside as negligible))
not to be outdone by Victoria is also char-
mingly characteristic; likewise the request!
to the State Government that it should!
grant land for a site for a specially-built
veterans’ home, and d—n the expense, with
the patriotic object of putting Victoria’s
nose out of joint. Meanwhile the much
more pertinent question arises: When is the
Commonwealth going to begin thinking
about an army and navy pension scheme
such as other civilised countries enjoy?
“Bad Australian’s” sermon from Chili: —
Chile is some 2700 miles long, but its width is
only 90 or 100 miles. Most of it consists of road
metal, with some rich deposits of nitrate, copper,
silver and borax in the northern provinces. The
cultivable land is practically all comprised in the
estuaries and narrow valleys of the rivers which flow
from the Andes to the Pacific across the southern
half of the country. The population is something
under 4,000,000, but it is solid on one thing—the
necessity for being able to hang on to what it has
got. Finding, when accounts were settled after the
unpleasantness with Peru and Bolivia some years
ago, that being ready panned out a good dividend,
Chile set itself to the task of becoming still readier.
It bought more modern warships and guns, some of
them with the money torn off the fellow who wasn’t
ready; it acquired more up-to-date outfits for its
troops, mostly in the way of magazine rifles and
mountain batteries; it imported British and German,
instructors for the navy and army; and, altogether,,
after a lot of hard work on the universal training;
system, it has knocked together about the smartest;
fighting force on land or sea in South America.
And still not feeling satisfied, this one-horse strip)
of backbone has set itself to build a railway from
one end of the rock to the other. The greater part
of it is nothing more than a military road, for prac-
tically the whole of the northern section runs
through about the most desolate country on earth,
without a vestige of vegetation or animal life, an«s
where rain has been unknown within the memory of
the oldest inhabitant. Such a railroad is not the
soft snap in the way of construction that Aus-
tralia’s straight line to the Territory would be. On
one of the lower sections .about 40 miles of rock
(Abt system) is used, no other- being practicable
owing to the wild nature of the country. Farther
north, where the line traverses the great desert of
Atacama, the conditions of life are simply hor-
rible ; but the cheerful patriot faces it all without
the least idea that he is doing anything out of the
common. The only products of this northern region
are minerals; and even these will be of little use
to the line, as the fields are already served by
numerous short spurs to the Pacific, where the pro-
ducts connect with water carriage. The northern
section is 440 miles long and has been completed at
a cost of £3,055,750. The southern section of 600
miles will be ready by the end of the year. There
will then remain about 100 miles to link up t<v
Tacna, a short distance from the Peruvian frontier.t-
and when that is complete Chile will be able ,to>
deliver the goods on its own territory or .'that ‘ of
Peru without any of the annoyance it suffered from
the Peruvian warships during the last little trouble.
Let my countrymen and their Chilian-born ad
viser, Chris. Watson, paste this in their hats, and
drop skiting about their vast territory,/'their- enter-
prise and their superiority to anything with the
streak of the tarbrush in it, and get busy on the
Long North Road before the other brown man, whc -
is ready, drops in with his gun and his general un- .
thinkableness.

The Greater J. D. Williams Amusement Co., Ltd. W. Barrington Miller, General Manager-
a case wherein a plaintiff in a land dispute admitted
in the witness box that certain statements made by
her in a statutory declaration in connection with the
property at issue were false. His Honor was shocked;
also, he was more than shocked on finding that there
were many documents in the case “all of a like
nature, and made by different persons.” Further: “He
was not calling attention to the matter with a view
to having the person alluded to prosecuted; if that
were his intention he would deal with the case him-
self .... But persons who made statements of this kind
were liable to 10 to 15 years’ imprisonment, and he
certainly thought the attention of the Minister of
Lands should be called to the matter.” But why
not the attention of the Attorney General? To my
mind, and I fancy to the minds of most people, the
person who lies in a court of law to save a woman’s
honor or a mate’s liberty is much less reprehensible
than the one who swears falsely in order to gain
some material advantage—a block of the public land,
for example, which is highly liable to be gained at
the expense of some more deserving but less dishonest
applicant.
Col. Onslow, in N. S. Wales’s classical
Leg. Assembly the other evening:—
L desire to know whether an hon. member is
entitled to call hon. members cows and mongrels ?
That’s the “way of it up there nowadays.
They’re not sure if it’s good form or not!
Apparently Hans Sauerkraut, who was a
confirmed landsman 60 years ago, has really
learned the craft of the sea. When 10
steamers of mixed nationalities rushed, in
answer to the S.O.S. call, to the aid of the
burning Volturno, in mid-Atlantic, on a
dark night full of storms, it was Wilhelm
Bludwiirst who did the best. Out of 521
passengers or thereabouts who were saved he
dragged off 231.
A case with a bearing on Australia’s big-
gest political and social question was heard
in the Perth City Court the other day, when
“a fashionably-dressed, educated Japanese
named Yosheda was charged with permitting
his private house to be used for Flossie pur-
poses. The defence consisted almost wholly
of an attempt to prove that Yosh was a very
top-notch Japanese—he had been consular
representative in Westralia, and had only
the other day been honored with an invita-
tion to an important public function. No
doubt it was all true. But the fact remained
that, in spite of Yosh’s exceptional Jap
respectability, the Court found him guilty of
the Flossie offence in the private house
where his wife lived, and fined him £2O.
Which shows that even the tremendous
respectability of a consular agent doesn’t
prevent the Jap doing things which the
white person who isn’t more than a bit re-
spectable reckons horrible.
A few notes about gun-food and other
naval curiosities:—
The 12-inch shells, great, black, greasy cones that
look much too large for the gun-muzzles, are kept
in steel bins in the quiet, electrically-lighted maga-
zine below the turret. It is a still atmosphere, and
the low voices of the sailors, juggling the big, blunt-
nosed things with a hand tackle, are clear and dis-
tinct. One big shell knocks softly against another;
they look like affectionate young pigs in a sty. The
loading tray on which the projectile and flannel-
wrapped cordite" charges are delivered by the tackle,
is on a circular rack which follows the base of the
revolving turret around. Once in the slot, it flies
up at the touch of a lever to the open breech of the
gun—the big, shining breech that is opened with a
whistling shriek of compressed air—and is shoved
far down the barrel by the big, jointed, mechanical
rammer that uncoils, with a deafening rattle, does
its work in one wriggling thrust, and runs back out
of the way. That jointed rammer is one of the sur-
prises of the turret working. The sweating sailor
in the magazine explains with pride how an auto-
matic bolt in the shoot-door prevents the over-curious
dispenser of projectiles from putting his silly head
into ’ the shoot at the w.rong instant and getting
neatly 'guillotined. It is one of the minor risks of
his job, and, apparently, he regards the safety device
as a bonus.
They distinguish the different sorts of shells by
the colored paint rings they wear round their snouts.
The shrapnel, which is laden with steel balls about
the size of a watch, is designed to burst fan wise.
(“Meant for us.e, sir, against infantry crossin’ a
bridge.” One feels sorry for the infantry—whoever
they may be.) The lower conning “tower,” where
the ship is fought from after things above go to
smash, suggests an iron bear-pit fitted with a few
telephones and things. When the time comes, there
will be weird contrivances there for the commander
to see with; but it will be rather like fighting
shadows in another world—-a resounding world of
bare steel, flame and horror.
The doctor is very proud of some light canvas and
bamboo stretchers in which a man may be parcelled
up neatly like a mummy and passed through man-
holes and down hatchways. The special X-ray appar-
atus, in a case about as big as a harmonium, is a
special exhibit of the sick bay. It is a highly
decorative machine, beautifully plated and finished.
Two twinkling spring rolls of metallic gold braid
serve instead of the usual cumbersome electrical con-
nections. The job of the two doctors, when the ship
is in action, is to stay well under cover in their
electrically-lighted steel cells, listen patiently to the
hell-noises, see nothing, and wait for a lull. In the
Russo-Jap trouble, the medical staff of one ship were
the only members of the ship’s company who were
killed ; they went looking for work too soon.
The steel-floored engine-rooms, to which you go
down by a lift, are all gauges, dials, telephones and
steam pipes. There are no masses of grey, naked
steel to look at—no giant cranks or pistons shining
sleekly with oil. “McAndrew’s Hymn,” with its
reverent Scotch references to connecting rods, throws
and such, will have to be re-written or scrapped to
suit the compact, hooded turbines that are really
enclosed steam windmills.
Another slide downward with the engineer-lieuten-
ant, and the humming fires of the stokehold are
gleaming behind their doors. It is hot, but the heat
is not the stifling, stale heat of a crowded and badly*
ventilated theatre; the draught of the fires and the
ventilating fans keep the atmosnhere fresh, though
you are below the waterline and enclosed by hot
steel. One doesn’t realise how far behind the hygienic
times some theatres are until he has visited the
Australia’s stokehold.

in Sydney with “The Mastersingers of
Nuremberg” in Her Majesty’s. “If we wish
to know what Wagner means, we must
fight our way through his drama to his
music,” thunders the voice of Bayreuth.
The German composer is popularly sup-
posed to have written “The Mastersingers”
as a comic pendant to the minnesingers in
“Tannhauser.” The comedy is so labored in
the “pendant ” that we must fight our way
over the bodies of the Nuremberg appren-
tices to much of the magnificent orchestra-
tion in the first act. There is very little
chorus-singing for these “comic” youths—
certainly not enough to justify their per-
sistent horseplay while Conductor Eckhold
is drawing siren sounds from his fiddlers
and wood-winds. Town-Clerk Beckmesset - ,
as sketched by Wagner, is the low-comedy
gent, who is expected to make the audience
laugh by singing out of tune. On Saturday
bight the front of the house dawdled in
late—some of the galleryites had been wait-
ing since four in the afternoon—and could
give no more than a sickly smile to Beck-
messer. Yet Dever made the best of this
very “sick” part. Eva. the goldsmith’s
daughter, is the prize. For her sake Beck-
messer bawls like Romeow on the back
fence in any suburb. For her, also,
does tenor Spencer Thomas, as Wal-
ther, bellow in tune. What he sings
cannot be of much consequence, for he
might be doing it in Hottentot so far as the
audience is any the wiser. Thomas, how-
ever, is acceptable as a pleasing tenor with
a rounder and more extensive organ than
he obliged us with in 1932.
“ THE MAS IE RSINGE RS,” AT HER
MA TESTY'S, SYDNEY.
The tuneful cobbler, Sacks (Robert Parker),
deserts his-last to help Spencer Thomas sing
his way into the heart of Eva.
Jeanne Brola, the Eva of Saturday
night’s production, has too light a soprano
to contend with the full blast of a Wag-
nerian orchestra. Mabel Dennis, in the
small part of Magdalene, was more articu-
late than most of the company. The new
tenor, Maurice D’Oislv. as the rotund ap-
prentice David, has fine, healthy lung-
power, and downed the orchestra quite
twice. Baritone Parker, the poet cobbler-
visionary' Hans Sachs, is the central figure.
Wagner, as everyone knows, came under
the influence of Schopenhauer; and Act
111. in this long-winded music-drama is
always pointed at as showing the trail of
Schopenhauer in Sach’s half-mile of mono-
logue. Parker was good but not great as
the warbling cobbler. “The Mastersingers,”
which takes about 44 hours to drag itself
to a terminus, has a male cast of 15. This
does not include the apprentice chorus. The
orchestra, however, has the star turn, and
its turn is going on all the time. The over-
ture was a superb sample of Wagnerian
music conducted by a Wagnerian expert—
the bushy-whiskered Eckhold. The second
act has a prelude, which was one of the
most subtle imitative efforts of the com-
poser, reproducing the sleepy twitter of a
feathered choir at dusk. Unfortunately, the
singing tones of the fiddles were stamped
on by the stalled ox (returning from his in-
terval over an adjacent whisky) till the
gallery said “Hush —sh !”
* * * *
Having on Saturday given Wagner in
“The Mastersingers” a chance to poke borak
at the Italian school of opera, Quinlan did
the amiable on Monday by producing “Rigo-
letto,” thereby allowing the Italian school
to speak in its own defence. But “Rigo-
letto” isn’t a very imposing defence: no
jury would be so far carried away as to
pass the prisoner at the bar a vote of thanks
after acquitting him. This mustn’t, how-
ever, be misunderstood. There are patches
in the defence which stir the audience;
wherefore on Monday night the confirmed
grand-opera enthusiast flinched, and once
actually writhed, when applause broke in
on the proceedings and hung up the pro-
gress of the story. On the noisiest outburst
Miss Felice Lyne, making that evening her
first appearance in Sydney, tripped back on
to the stage, and did some smiling curtsies,
whereas the interruption really called for
incurable deafness. Apparently the audi-
ence, recognising three or four things that
operatic sopranos and tenors have made
familiar, fancied it was back again at a
concert hall; and this attitude was pre-
served while the orchestra was doing some
of its best work—when nobody was sing-
ing it was taken as a hint that everybody
might chatter, and ask who the man in the
front row of the d.c. was: the man in the
grey sac-suit, conspicuous among the other-
wise-black human beetles. As a matter of
fact, it was Syd Kidman, “the cattle king,”
and a king can wear what he likes. The
male chorus sang notably well, and even
acted with vigor; Miss Lyne, though her
voice has no very large qualities, managed
it admirably, especially in the familiar
“Caro Nome” number; Maurice D’Oisly’s
equally familiar “Donna e Mobile” (very
well done into English) was sung with
grace and spirit; and Samuell, in the name
part (Rigoletto is a hunchback jester, who
is overwhelmed with all the tragedy), pro-
duced again the voice which so pleased
Sydney in the former Quinlan season. And
he did more than sing his numbers: he
acted dramatically throughout. The lesser
people were, on the whole, well up to the
average of a performance which, since it
gives the orchestra no great opportunities,
will not jump to the front when the season
is being recalled three months hence.
“The Cingalee” is having a week’s revival
at Sydney Royal. It is full of bright music,
some of which has become frayed and tat-
tered through being too “catchy,” though
other parts of the score, including some of
the concerted numbers, retain a lot of their
original charm and freshness. Andrew
MacCunn’s instrumentalists on Saturday
night made them all worth listening to.
Some of the singers backed MacCunn
up and the choruses were generally
satisfactory; but the orchestra did most
of the work. The English “book” has
crow’s-feet round the eyes, and the
lyrical references to the smartness of the
Bayswater girl and other complete strangers
leave the modern Australian audience cold.
The feature dancing, apart from Miss Arun-
dale’s contribution, is uninteresting. The
mounting is adequate, but the ventilation
of the dress circle isn’t. The writer
sampled the battle-cruiser Australia’s stoke-
hold when the ship was at anchor (accord-
ing to the engineer-lieutenant, its very hot-
test phase), and he prefers it to the dress
circle of Sydney Royal as it was on Saturday
night. When a theatre is as stuffy as that,
the best part of the entertainment is the
interval. It seems injudicious on the part
of any theatrical management to make the
free open-air seem so attractive. Next
Saturday evening, the co. will start to fare-
well with “Dorothy.”
* Hi * *
Another profitable Sydney season of “On
Our Selection” will be concluded to-morrow
night at the Palace, after which Dad will
take the family on a tour of N. S. Wales,
commencing at Newcastle on Saturday. No
other piece will be played, owing to that
old martinet, General Desire, having made
himself so prominent in the matter.
* *
Allen Doone, the “Popular Irish Singing
Gomedian” (see advt.), will take over the
Palace (Svdoey) on Saturday, and put on
“Barry of Ballymoore.” Some of the old
favorites will follow. The Bulletin has
never fathomed why they are favorites, any
more than it knows why Doone can put his
singing so successfully across an audience;
There are singers no worse than Doone who
couldn’t fill the Palace with the aid of the
police.
“There is a dreadful evil in our midst,
and this play is written with the object of
trying to wipe it out.” That isn’t th* t .
note to the recently-deceased NSW vf
cination Bill; it is merely the Adelphi’s'
form of apology for producing “The
bide of London” before any civilised n
ence The “dreadful evil” men oned
London’s white-slave traffic; and C. Watson
Mill, the perpetrator of the piece natnrou
thought that the surest way to wipe Tt nS
would be to write a play in the hope tha
it might be produced at the
Theatre, Sydney, and other
command vast influence over London’s
morals. The bellowdrama isn’t new t
Sydney; it has already shrieked here with
Harry Diver, plus an excessive supply of
green limelight, as the principal villain
ihat was over two years ago, and the dimi-
nution m London’s white-slave traffic since
that first dose of the medicine has
been tremendous. Thus encouraged the
Adelphi is trying the same prescript on
again Naturally the play is chock-full of
absurdities and of weeping and wailing
females, tall-top-ha tted ruffians, heroic pugi
listic parsons and bad, bold women ■ also
there is the usual assortment, of low’ com
edians and lower uncomedians, all of them
necessary to clearly impress upon London
the error of its ways. T. W. Lloyd as
Herod Steinberg, the worst egg; George
Cross, the clerical ladies’ man; and Miss
Vera Remee, supplier-in-chief of female
weeps, are the principals in a cast that
deserves better food for reflection than “The
Blighted Side of London.” There may be
something more cheerful about “White as a
Lily,” which is due next Saturday.
Sydney audiences insist on taking Wagner':,
“ Mastersingers” seriously.
The gentleman marked x earns universal
disapproval for daring to laugh at the comic
baker ( Graham Marr).
TVithin the Law,” a play that has all
the faults and all the merits of the modern
American melodrama, is still at Sydney
Criterion, and likely to remain there till
dynamite shifts it.
* * :!:
At Sydney’s Little Theatre “The Butter-
flies” have flown and “The Dominoes” will
appear on Saturday.
* * * *
Doody and Wright are the latest to add
to the gaiety of nations at the Tivoli; their
comedy sketch doesn’t take long to “get
there,” and when it does get there it stays.
Ditto the turns of the two Mullers, “hoop
spinners extraordinary”; Diamond and
Beatrice, the instrumentalists; skaters
Reynolds and Donegan, and Fanton’s
athletes.

By the time this journal meets its clients
this week, the hand of desolation will have
removed from the National (Sydney) Lalie
Moore, Gladys and Alber, Hilary Long (who
conducts his business affairs while upside
down), and Sister Carrie Moore. It is a
fell swoop, but the Hubanik Gelli co. and
four other new acts are relied upon to dis-
perse the gloom. The H.G. lot will hand out
“tabloid” grand opera, which seems sensible
in these long-drawn nights of Marathon
opera.
* * * *
“The Last Days of Pompeii” at the
Lyceum is awarded the cinematographic
bun for remarkable snapshots. Up to the
present the Roman amphitheatre scenes in
“Quo Vadis” headed the list; but Spencer’s
latest beats them, though the picture as a
whole doesn’t approach the other. But the
scene wherein the thousands demand the
blood of the alleged murderer; and the one
where a still more tremendous crowd in the
amphitheatre await the lions’ feed; and
finally the eruption of Vesuvius (taken dur-
ing one of the volcano’s recent lapses), and
the subsequent destruction of the city—these
settle its claim to be a very remarkable
picture.

Of another paint show:—
It is on at the Royal Art Society’s Rooms, Sydney,
and comprises 80 canvases by Australian artist F..
Phillips Fox, who is back from Britain and the rest of
Europe after an absence of several years. No art lover
or student should miss this show. Fox has hung sam-
ples of his work that have had the approval of the
Royal Academy, Paris Salon, International, Salon
d’Automne and other famous galleries from 1905 to
1913. The freshness and vivacity of his color sense

are the first charm of the artist, as particularly ex-
emplified in No. 4, “The Ferry” (Royal Academy
1911 ; Paris Salon, 1912). Fox'" has a striking dSt-’
ness, too, in handling degrees of light and reflections
although this is not so apparent in several of a series
of outdoor nudes. The three most ambitious efforts
in the exhibition are “The Terrace” (Royal Academy
1912), “The Arbor” (Royal Academy, 1912 Sis
Salon, 1911) and “Lamplight” (Royal Academy
1911 ; Paris Salon, 1912). The first-named is a
successful outdoor study in bright sunlight while
“Lamplight” is an interior depiction of the ’coming
of evening, with striking fidelity to the quietude of
the fading hour. On the other hand, “The Terrace”
is a disappointment, by reason of the wax-model-like
pose of the seven figures. The handiest remedy for the
disappointment is to turn to No. 45 (“The Seine at
Les Andelys”). The exquisite blue of distance
therein is alone worth the trip up the stairs.

The “Walter Bentley” Players are billed
to give their usual monthly performance to-
night (Thursday), at St. James’ Hall,
Phillip-street, Sydney. The varied pro-
gramme is made up of five complete sketches
and a scene from Bulwer Lytton’s “Riche-
lieu.”
The trouble with “Henry V.,” late of
Sydney, but just now living the loud, spec-
tacular life at Her Majesty’s (Melb.), is
the same old trouble which discounted the
charm of George Rignold’s memorable per-
formances in the long ago. What little
human interest the play possesses is frit-
tered away by the interruptions of the tab-
leau curtain, which practically divide it
into eight or 10 acts. The occasional ex-
planatory discourses of Chorus are further
wastes of time, although Miss Madge Tith-
eradge makes Chorus a very pleasing young
person, and her elocution is, for the most
part, quite admirable. An audience is not
gripped by this revival of Shakspeare’s
patchy jingo play, nor would Her Majesty’s
comparatively shallow stage be a favorable
pitch for its pomp and circumstance under
the best of acting conditions. Many of the
performers in this production are uncon-
vincing, as, for instance, the youthful-look-
ing Constable of France, the somewhat
artificial Pistol, the Governor of Harfleur
and several persons of exalted rank on the
programme. The supes. put no suggestion
of warlike spirit into their storming of
Harfleur. and when their picturesque leader,
Lewis Waller, speaks his large, heroic lines,
ope is reminded that Eric Maxon’s mimicry
has preceded him, even as many an original
vaudeville songster from Britain has been
already made familiar to Australian ears
by somebody who had pinched his songs
and vocal mannerisms. Miss Titheradge is
charming in the insipid character of Kath-
erine ; and Titheradge pdre, Halliwell
Hobbes, Quartermaine, Halley and others
are placed as they were when The Bulle-
tin noticed the show in Sydney. It will be
limited to two weeks at Her Majesty’s.
Then Lewis Waller and Co. will shift to the
Royal and doff their plumed helms to “A
Butterfly on the Wheel.”
* * * *
“Excuse Me,” published for the first of
12 nights at Melbourne Royal on Saturday,
is a mild tale of revelry in an Amurkan
overland express, relying more for effect on
eccentricity than on story interest. A
series of slight and disconnected episodes,
definitely erotic in purpose, present a
fraudulent air of novelty in the vitiated
atmosphere of a Pullman car. Jimmy Wel-
lington, a diligent seeker of drinks, has
taken a first-class ticket to Reno, apparently
with the object of dissuading Mrs. Jimmy
from securing one of Reno’s hurried divorces.
The fact that his missus is off to that vil-
lage by the same vehicle as her disorderly
property is a happy accident, which soon
leads to the two burying their past ani-
mosity in a fresh rapprochement. This
goes on side by side with the amorous pro-
ceedings of Ira Lathrop and Henry Mallory
and the respective damsels of their desire.
Lathrop’s affair is merely the casual reunion
of long-separated canoodlers, but Mallory’s
case is peculiar, inasmuch as. having rushed
his donah into a false nosition, he has to
announce the lady as Mrs. Mallory, and
then run over the passenger list in search of
a parson to make them legally and per-
manently one. Mallory’s unsuccessful hunt
for a holy man —for the only one on the
train is heavily disguised in a red necktie and
a bad cigar—with the humors of a couple of
train robbers, a nigger porter, and a tender-
foot Englishman, is regarded as sound and
powerful reason why “Excuse Me” should
be mistaken for the last word in “screams.”
Three acts of it are plenty, and the inclu-
sion of a long and irrelevant monologue by
Fred Niblo, in the second chapter, is an
obvious attempt at padding the weakest part.
Fred Niblo has less to do in this diversion
than in some others, but he acts Harry
Mallory with great verbal vivacity, whilst
getting crushing effects with his nicely-
brushed hair and well-creased clothes. Bob
Greig pictures Jimmy Wellington as a thirsty
imposture with most of his refreshers run-
ning to his feet, and E. Pirie Bush draws
Harold Wedgewood as a spectacle of aristo-
cratic English civilisation appalled by the
barbarism of modern Amurka. John De
Lacy plays Ira Lathrop with the full
strength of his baritone, Ray Royce’s Dr.
Temple is amiably undistinguished, and Fred
Cambourne’s Sambo, if anything, suffers
from a rush of intellect to the head. Miss
Beatrice Holloway is a success as Marjorie
Newton and Miss Marion Clarke’s Mrs. Wel-
lington has some quality, but every one of
the other ladies is gracefully unequal to the
demands of her part.
** * *
No piece of extravagance staged in Mel-
bourne of late years has approached the
superlative absurdity of “Queen of the
White Slaves,” at the Princess’s. A mild-
mannered Prince of Foochow, familiarly
known as Fong Low, is the moving spirit
in this series of practical jokes. Ralph
Grimes, a San Francisco bad man, furnishes
hong’s harem with the necessary ladies.
Grimes’s agency at ’Frisco is a Barbary
Coast Concert Hall, where eight flappers
g ggle the giddy hours away and opium
fiends drop in for a smoke. In this strong-
hold of iniquity Grimes and his donah take
their orders from the genial Low, but for-
tunately Cyril Mackay, disguised as Bert
the Detective, conspires with a wandering
sailor and a small newsgirl to thwart the
blighter’s schemes. All of them get to
China in the next act by various means,
save the boss opium fiend. He is dropped
overboard from Fong’s yacht and left to die
on a raft, detective Bert having rescued
him from the angry waves whilst his beau-
teous sister was being abducted on the
quarter-deck. After which the lady joins
the flappers in the palace gardens
at_ Foochow and is condemned to see her
faithful Bert torn limb from limb by order
of the Terrible Nine, who appear to be
mostly the same eight flappers hooded in
black saddle-cloths and numbered like
starters for the Caulfield Cup. The tribunal
of the Terrible Nine is too dimly lighted to
admit of their identity being sworn to, but
their silence throws a terrible doubt upon
their sex. Anyhow, the villain’s donah and
another girl pop up in time to prevent
Cyril Mackay from being thrown into a
burning, fiery cellar. As a result of this
unwarrantable interference Cyril and the
Queen of the White Slaves are immured
in Fong’s dungeon with the moving walls,
where they would be squeezed flat but for
the wandering sailor, the opportune news-
girl and the unaccountable donah. Their
friends in need pull them through a hole in
the roof, thus bringing the pri.son manage-
ment of the Terrible Nine into richly-
merited contempt. Having escaped from
all the torture chambers, these remarkable
American citizens capture the harem, where
the flappers are, and everything ends
funnily.
J. S. Mann’s scenery is more helpful to
the entertainment than the acting of the
co. Mackay, Vox, Leigh, Misses Fergusson
and Helen Fergus and others struggle
through their parts in a comparatively quiet
manner, whereas they ought to regard the
job as a pantomime and chuck themselves
about. Humorous opportunities go begging
for sympathetic treatment. However, the
Willoughby management, by introducing the
Royal Banzai Family into the gardens of
Fong Low’s Palace, has given the alleged
drama the attraction of a fine vaudeville
show. The Banzai Japs are the quickest,
slickest and most wonderful novelty acro-
bats, balancers and foot-workers the Com-
monwealth has experienced. The brilliant
success of their “turn” puts the amazing
feats of the Terrible Nine narrative into the
shade.

“THE CONFES-
SION." AT
MELBOURNE
KING’S.
Charles Brown as
Michael Grogan,
the Sexton.
“The Confession” is to go for another
week or even longer at the King’s.
Every evening until further notice Father
Roberts will have to sit silent in the stage
police-court whilst the murderer to whom
he gave absolution swears that he saw his
riverence’s brother do the awful deed.
Roberts makes a very good attempt to look
sorry for everybody, including himself and
the guilty liar, under the mental strain of
this ordeal, although he knows quite well
that Ananias Cain will put things right in
the next act. The court scene, in fact, is
discreetly played by all persons present, and
it must strike the King’s public as a much
more reasonably constructed scene of its
kind than usually comes their way.

The Corson Clarke Co., reinforced by a
new arrival from America, will start to
argue the question “What Did Tomkins
Do?” at the Bijou on Saturday.
The Prosecuting Attorney (R. H. Stephenson).
Saturday, the 18th, is the date appointed
for Gregan McMahon’s one more production
of “Strife.” Galsworthy’s play is now being
rehearsed anew at the National Amphi-
theatre, at the top of Bourke-street, where
it will get almost as much stage room as it
deserves. On the same night Branscombe
will start a new company of Dandies at his
Arcadia, on St. Kilda Esplanade. Another
matter which The Bulletin has been de-
sired to mention in this issue is the forth-
coming visit to Melbourne of John McCor-
mack and his concert co. McCormack’s
mellifluous tenor will be heard at the Audi-
torium on Thursday, 23rd, and three sub-
sequent occasions.

Frank Fox and Miss Bonnie Leonard
made their first appearance at Melbourne
Opera House on Saturday. Mr. Fox be-
longs to the same active school of humor as
Lillie Langtry and Austin Rudd, and Miss
Leonard, billed as “The Girl with a Million
Smiles,” passably warbles a couple of songs
without furnishing any evidence in support
of her title. Tom Dawson is once more
opening his countenance for a living; Wil-
liams and Rankin still tootle effectively on
brazen instruments; and the Russian
Dancers, being on the brink of departure,
will be but graceful memories shortly after
this paragraph puts on its pink morning
wrapper and goes out to see what the world
is like.

At Melbourne Olympia on Saturday
Charles Spencer biographed the crimes of a
party named Fantomas (understood to be a
misprint for Fantod), a most elusive
miscreant. Fantod baffles the expert
intellects of the Parisian C.1.D., and
whenever he seems in imminent danger of
capture, he simply fades away, leaving
naught behind but a whiff of smoke and the
echo of his deep “Ha! Ha!” Fantod is a
warm favorite at Spencer’s at present, but
the crowd is expressing considerable sym-
pathy for a potentate named Tony, who,
having pawned his best girl for 150 dollars,
cannot raise the coin to redeem the beau-
teous and buxon* pledge.

In a successful second week at Adelaide
Royal is “The Grafters,” the unconventional
singing-play which hasn’t any hero or hero-
ine, but has, instead, Some naive advertise-
ments of a coming Exhibition and of a
brand of whisky. Miss St. Claire scores in
a kind of Palotta part, and Miss Le Blanc
is a fine low-comedian. The male humorists,
La Blanc, Burgess, Nowlin and Vack, are
all good, but all very deliberate and long-
drawn-out, in the modern American style.
So are the Hoboes, still at the Tivoli, which
sumptuous new house has a strong and well-
balanced programme. Miss Willette Whit-
aker is immensely popular, and the trans-
parent but quite discreet dressing-room
of the eight Saxones lends a novelty to their
dancing turn. Jack Prince has an engaging
personal touch on the fiddle: Marini is here
again to sing, and Sydney Bach to “enter-
tain.” At the King’s are Decars, acrobats:
Max Duffek, who makes perfectly good
music while tying himself in knots; and a
lot of clever new American people. The
Waterloo film at West’s brings out some
historical points—among them that both
Wellington and Napoleon spent the greater
part of the eventful day indoors. It is a
fine, stirring, regardless-of-expense picture.
Wondergraph Co. has finished its long lease
of the Town Hall, but is not content with its
finely-appointed new Hindley-street house,
and, stimulated probably by the hottest
October day for 60 years, is showing also in
its open-air corner on North Terrace.
Among many concerts, prominent have been
a Brewster Jones piano recital at the Exhi-
bition and an amateur Variety evening, of
great social tonnage, at Glenelg.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Lewis Waller is going to fly in the face of Mel-
bourne precedent by giving a matinee performance of
“Henry V.” on Caulfield Cup Saturday. It will be
a special mat. for schools and colleges, earnest young
students and their tutors being supposed to have
minds far above horse-racing. But why not advertise
that King Henry will announce the winner’s name
at the Battle of Agincourt? Probably even a few
lovers of the Bard would like to know the fate of
their five bob.
From S’Africa: Aubrey Dennistoun Hoad, elder
son of the late General, will tour Australia in 1914
with his own company. “The Flail of Fate,” “Path-
finders,” “Drake” and “Dorian Gray” will be in the
repertoire. Hoad resumed his original part in “Kis-
met” when Oscar Asche and Lily Brayton opened in
Johannesburg. Sir Herbert Tree retained Hoad for
the “Othello” production at His Majesty’s, London,
which prevented the young Australian actor touring
Australia with the Asche-Brayton combination.
There will be some hustling in Australian theatres
next year. The Tait Brethren have made a specula-
tion in drama by purchasing Florence Barclay’s “The
Rosary”: Beaumont Smith, in conjunction with
Mayer, of the London Strand Theatre, will offer Rex
Beach’s “The Barrier” ; Carroll, of Queensland, will
tour a panto with Florrie Forde (warbling in the
English ’Alls for some years) as chief boy; Wil-
loughby also insists on a pantomime; and “The Glad
Eye,” the revue “Come Over Here,” and Anderson’s
“Land of Nod” will introduce new cos. Added to
these will be a sure Lauder and a possible Pavlova.
The one lone, likely exportation is “On Our Selec-
tion,” which may go to the Big Smoke.
“The Second Footman”: Never in all my experi-
ence of service have there been such excursions and
alarms in connection with ballroom dances as there were
during the festive period that has just passed Sydney by.
In the first place there was the two-sfep pro-
blem ; and the position was exacerbated, later, by
the uprising of the one-step menace. The moment
the ball began, it became all too plain to those
whose dreary job it is to stand and wait up against
walls for the advent of supper, that the younger mem-
bers of Society had been squandering their leisure
in the acquisition of the new steps. As the unre-
generate young people fled by, their feet moving in
a way distinctly different from that which was the
vogue in Good Prince Albert’s time, low moans of
“dreadful” and “shocking” issued from every wall.
The culminating point was reached at Government
House. If you want to see the Bunny Hug done with
genuine enthusiasm and faithfulness to pattern, go
to the more distant suburbs—Summer Hill, Stan-
more, and so on. Most of the girls who attended the
Stricklands’ big ball came from afar, and many of
them gave expositions of the new movement that
stirred the non-dancing section to frenzy. It was
decided by a number of elderly matrons that the
thing must be stopped—just as Queen Mary came
to a similar decision in London recently. Individual
girls were warned, objurgated, implored. Without
the least avail, however. One reason was that all
the programmes of all the dances contained hardly
anything else but two-steps and one-steps. The idea
Of those responsible apparently was that the band
should play one thing and the guests should dance
another. The spectacle of people waltzing in a
puzzled, broken, miserable sort of way to syncopated
airs like the “Gaby Glide” and “Robt. E. Lee,” was
amply sufficient to debar those who knew the steps
nominally associated with such musical efforts from
imitating the waltzers’ example. The only way to
abolish the one-step is to wipe it off the programme.
Sq long as one-steps are played, those who don’t want
to either look foolish or sit down will dance them.
The management of the “From Manager to Cross”
film writes from Melbourne: That excellent critic,
“0.K.,” makes a few comments regarding our film
(B. 9/10/’l3). Says he: “An introductory speech
is delivered by an elderly gentleman in a frock coat
and a German accent.” Just let us ' say that
each evening a different clergyman introduces the
film ; and, as our aim is to avoid sectarianism, these
clergymen represent all denominations and religious
bodies.
Just dead in Germany, Smaun Singh Hpoo, aged
31, the midget black brother who was recently on
show in Australia. His exact weight was 261 b., and
he drew a salary equal to 255. per lb. per week. A
sister a few ounces lighter dropped dead on the
stage of New York Hippodrome a few years ago,
leaving behind an insurance policy for £6OOO. Hpoo,
who was a really accomplished gymnast, was located
in Burmah, and introduced to the show business by
Max Weltzien, formerly skipper on an Australian
coastal boat.

TWO VETERANS.
[For The Bulletin.]
They sing their youthful love! Yet he is bald
And comfortably fat! He shouts and waddles.
Her corset strings, observe, are tightly hauled!
She gasps and totters and she pants and toddles.
Her armor can with straining just encompass
The pillow chest with which she makes a rumpus.
He calls her “Dear,” and strokes her bulging arm;
But fat and middle-age half choke his passion.
She flies en masse from him. Her mock alarm
Perturbs him terribly. In tender fashion
He waddles after, crying hell-for-leather,
To clasp the stays that hold his love together.
She turns! She falls on him! No, no, she leans!
(Some fourteen stone of corseted affection
Would be too much to hold for lengthy scenes.)
They step off gaily in the same direction!
The audience applauds them for the science
With which they shout at Age and Fat defiance.

From the Oldest Inhabitant: —
Apropos Shell Cove (B. 9/10/’l3). F.' H. Grundy,
in his “Pictures of the Past,” says it was called
Murderer’s Bay at one time. Grundy lived in bache-
lor’s quarters there. It was also known as Hungry
Bay. On the Cremorne side there is a 100 ft. reser-
vation, but on the Neutral Bay side the water front
is alienated—to the great joy of one owner, who
recently sold some of it at £25 per foot.
The other evening a citizen who chanced
to be supporting a post in Chapel-street,
P’ran (Vic.), observed the approach of what
looked like a flaming devil bolting from the
vengeance of Beelzebub, his chief. It ulti-
mately turned out to he a motor-cyclist with
his machine on tire and his coat-tails blazing
in the ureeze. He was a hurried passer-by,
with no time to notice what was behind
him, so the citizen broke a fire alarm and
sooled an engine on to him. Simultaneously,
more or less, his jigger jibbed or struck or
burst 1 or something, and the brigade got a
chance to turn the hose on to the rider’s
heated garments and souse his wrecked
machine. Then a corporation laborer swept
the ruins into the gutter, and a brilliant and
exciting “turn” was over. This is the. sort
of episode that makes one understand why
people support posts. The possibility of
adventure is a tremendous lure. Three-
quarters of the crowd in the city streets on
a shopping night are there in the vague hope
that something exciti g may transpire. It
hardly ever does, the world being a dull, grey
place, these law-abiding days. But when the
unexpected arrives and a man gets mur-
dered, or a policeman apprehends a bogus
drunk or a mad cyclist goes shrieking past
with a forest of flames in his wake, all the
boredom of past nights is forgiven and for-
gotten.
“ Jeames” on his defence :
The other day I referred to Governor Strickland,
of N; S. Wales, as “bourgeois.” Shrieks of protest
from the suburbs, where every Englishman of birth
is regarded as unassailable, socially, so long as he
remains solvent and moderately sober. The fact
that Sir Gerald s ancestors came over with the Con-
queror, or the Armada, or the original batch of Rag-
timers,''has been cited wildly, as though such a cir-
cumstance had anything whatever to do with the
case. None but those who are themselves utterly
and irremediably bourgeois could take so distorted
a view of the matter. To be bourgeois is a congeni-
tal trait, or affliction, like fiat feet, the habit of
wearing Jemima boots, and so on. Breeding does
not enter into the matter. The general tendency of
bourgeois people is to take the obvious view in all
things social and political, and to display a stunned
and scandalised appearance in the presence of inno-
vations in these lines. The bourgeois temperament
mostly runs to hideous clothes, indifferently cooked
food, a distrust of wine (drunkenness), cards (gam-
bling), mild flirtations (immorality), mixed surf-
ing (shameless immodesty), and other things that
make life bearable. Yet the bourgeois is by no
means always virtuous. The villainous old Crawley
baronet whom Thackeray portrayed so faithfully was
typically bourgeois. The bourgeois trait is one of
the hardest things to define in words; yet most
people who know the world can recognise it at a
hundred yards. The Earl of Meath, who was in Aus-
tralia the other day, was bourgeois to the back
teeth; so were the Rawsons and the Chelmsfords, and
in a slightly lesser degree, the Northcotes. Untitled
people, of no particular loftiness in the way of birth,
may, on the other hand, be enthusiastically exon-
erated of any such charge. I see by the London
papers, for example, that Major Brinton and Mrs.
William James have just been married. I have
waited on them both. Her late husband owned West
Dean Park, near Goodwood. The Major owns nothing
to speak of, barring a handsome face and the most
charming manners. Neither are in Debrett by virtue
of birth. Yet if some inexperienced footman (say)
were to term either of them bourgeois the entire
Servants’ Hall would arise, as one servitor, and
screech in dissent. Millionaire dukes may be bour-
geois—he of Newcastle, as a case in point, and the
late Duke of Sutherland. Contrariwise, the chroni-
cally hard-up and extremely deaf, but withal essenti-
ally “smart,” Mrs. Hwfa Williams has never been
accused of the offence, and never will be to her dying
day. Archbishop Wright is bourgeois: Bishop
Mercer isn’t. Wade and McGowen, of N.S.W.,
are; Holman is not, or, at any rate, not criminally
so. Alfred Deakin isn’t. Joseph Cook—-but let me
end here. Australia’s present Prime Minister can
supply a better idea of the bourgeois outlook in
one brief platform oration than any writer could in a
three-volume treatise on the subject.
Victoria is just now looking
dumbly to Cold Tea for ex-
planations and getting none..
Wonthaggi is to blame—Won-
thaggi, which is teetotal in so
far as it has no pubs, but
“clubs” of sorts and sly-grog
shops. The wives of this fav-
ored spot have neen writing to
Chief Secretary Weary—who
kept silence —and to Police
Commissioner Sainsbury—who
published their remarks —clam-
oring, in the name of sobriety,
for the licensing of proper
hotels. Premier Watt, having
condescended to notice the mat-
ter, has opined that “special
legislation” is needed to deal
with the evil, and that the offi-
cial licensing of the clubs would be effective.
It might, or it might lead to an increase of
sly-grog selling. But the establishment of that
State hotel that Peter Mcßride promised
long ago should kill both bogus clubs and
sly-groggeries. The State hotel doesn’t exist to
make as much as it can out of beertangle-
whisky foot, neither does it sell doctored or
poisonous stuff as good liquor. And the
average miner is a fair judge of liquor.
The- old scheme for linking up Hobart’s
marine suburbs with the city by means of a
bridge across the Derwent has once more
been revived, and an estimate of its pro-
bable cost is being called for. Present com-
munication is by the Rosny Estate and
Ferry Company’s line of steamers, and the
resurrection of the bridge scheme follows on
that co.’s attempt to balance its failure in
THE ENERGETIC WORKMAN.

lays a brick he stops to cackle. ”
land speculation with a 50 per cent, rise in
season fares. The suburbs’ howl of protest
has deafened several directors, and Bellerive
and Lindisfarne are considering the advis-
ability of packing up their sticks and mov-
ing into town —where there are no empty
houses to move to. In the public interest
the service should be a Government one.
Hobart can’t back much further on to the
mountain, and the suburbs across the water
are its natural offtlet; but the Government
has already pledged itself to a pretty stiff
schedule of public works, and is not likely
to add to its present responsibilities. Belle-
rive is the Kangaroo Point of the State’s
earliest records, and one of its legends is
that Parson Knopwood’s white pony once
swam across from the Hobart side to its
stable there. It was a record if it did, as
the distance must be nearly three miles.
The bridge was one of Governor Denison’s
pet projects, and the old twin ferry, Kan-
garoo, which still earns a Government sub-
sidy by taking carts and produce over the
river, dates back to his time. The O’May
family, who sold out to the Rosny Go. a year
or so ago, built up the passenger traffic, and
incidentally Bellerive and Lindisfarne ; their
connection with the traffic goes back three
generations and starts with a Scotch grand-
father and a whaleboat.
From an Australian pressman in S’Africa :
The visit of H.M.A.S. Australia and Sydney to
Table Bay has done us good, yet left us angry.
Until a year or so ago the Cape press could not find
one word of good to say about Australia or Austra-
lians. Editors ran out of dictionary adjectives of
derogation and abuse, and turned to the Taal for
help in the emergency. Now they have somersaulted
and are preaching the gospel of Australian nation-
hood and ideals to South Africa. All through the
dog days many bad Australians, a good loss to
their country, denied Australia, as did Peter of old
his Master. But there always have been good Aus-
tralians, who, through thick and thin, through good
and evil repute, at personal risk and financial loss,
proudly stood up for their mother country whenever
occasion demanded—which was pretty often. The
visit of the two ships gave the renegades the chance
to come back; and when the newspapers suddenly
burst into paeans, they remembered they were Aus-
tralians too. We had held a meeting whereat it had
been decided to present flags to the Admiral’s ship.
With Australian grit, the ladies—the best Austra-
lians in South Africa—decided to do the work with
their own hands. “We won’t have flags flying on our
ships in which a stitch has been put by colored
labor,” was the sentiment of the ladies. So thev
went to work and turned out a couple of flags of
the true sort. We had a wattle day, pressing into
service a bloom—the Port Jackson—which has the
merit of some resemblance to the golden wattle.
Then came the great banquet in the House of Parlia-
ment, the most exclusive function ever held in the
Cape. Six invitations were allotted to the Australian
community. And who do you think got them? The
renegades, mostly! True, there was one brilliant
exception—R. P. Fitzgerald, son of Nicholas, of Vic-
toria ; but for the rest, almost without exception,
Australia was represented by men who had but
yesterday denied or belied their country, and to-
morrow will probably do it again. Who pulled the
strings we don’t know; but the thing has left the
real Australian community' in S’Africa sore and
sorry.
The police of Geelong (Vic.) have been
making a raid on the young couples who lie
on the seaside after dark. Several couples
described as “reputable,” arid who have
“kept company” for various periods, were
summoned to the City Court to be lectured
by George Murphy, P.M. The P.M. himself
had sooled the police on to do this thing.
The sin of the al fresco canoodling was said
to lie in the fact that it happened after sun-
down, when darkness shrouded it from the
“disgust” of everybody save the policemen
who crept up and took the preoccupied com-
pany-keepers by surprise. No “indecent”

endearments had passed between the unfor-
tunate defendants in any given case, but
their method of “keeping company” was de-
clared to be “offensive” to the police. And
Murphy, P.M., being responsible for the
prosecutions, felt called upon to say that
“no decent man would marry a woman
who would lie on the beach in the arms of
one of the opposite sex.” Which is a
sweeping allegation, and one not calculated
to alarm any girl who gets herself hugged
on the sea-beach with a view to marrying
the hugger anon.
THE SNARE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Now come,” said the Devil, he said to me,
With his swart face all a-grin ;
“This day, ere ever the clock strikes three,
Shall you sin your darling sin.
For I’ve wagered a crown with Beelzebub,
Down there at the Gentlemen’s Brimstone Club,
I shall tempt you once, I shall tempt you twice,
And thrice shall you fall ere I tempt you thrice.”
“Begone, base Devil!” I made reply—
“ Begone, with your fiendish grin !
How hope you to profit by such as I,
For I have no darling sin.
But many there be, and I know them well,
All foul with sinning and ripe for Hell.
And I name no names, but the whole world knows
That I am never of such as those.”
“How now?” said the Devil. “I’ll spread my net,
And I vow I’ll gather you in !
By this and by that shall I win my bet,
And you shall sin the sin !
Come, fill up a bumper of good red wine.
Your heart shall sing, and your eye shall shin",
And you’ll know such joy as you never have known.
For the salving of man was the good wine grown.”'
“Begone, red Devil!” I made reply.
“Parch shall these lips of mine,
And my tongue shall shrink, and my throat go dry,
Ere ever I taste your wine!
But greet you shall, as I know full well,
A tipsy score of my friends in Hell.
And I name no names, but the whole world wots
Most of my fellows are drunken sots.”
“Ah, ha!” said the Devil. “You scorn the wine!
Thrice shall you sin, I say,
To win me a crown from a friend of mine,
Ere three o’ the clock this day.
Are you calling to mind some lady fair?
And is she a wife or a maiden rare?
’Twere folly to shackle young Love, hot Youth ;
Forbidden kisses are sweet, forsooth.”
“Begone, foul Devil!” I made reply,
“For never in all my life
Have I looked on a woman with lustful eye,
Be she maid, or widow, or wife.'
But my brothers! Alas! lam scandalised
At their evil passions so ill-disguised.
And I name no names, but my thanks I give
That I loathe the life my fellow-men live.”
“Ho, ho! ” roared the Devil in fiendish glee.
“ ’Tis a silver crown I win!
Thrice have you fallen ! O Pharisee,
You have sinned your darling sin!”
But, “Nay,” said I; “and I scorn your lure.
I have sinned no sin, and my heart is pure.
Come, tell me the sin that you think you see?”
But the Devil was gone.... and the clock struck
three.

Hi
“Headmaster”: There are a good many
apologetic and ashamed Australians in the
State Schools of Sydney, to judge by the
fact that about a hundred departments in
the metropolitan schools did not bother to
send along an entry for the Children’s Wel-
come to the Australian Navy on its arrival.
A special departmental circular was hur-
riedly issued asking, “Is it not possible, even
at this late hour, to send a representative
class to join in the demonstration welcoming
Our Own Fleet, which should have a recep-
tion no less cordial than that given to the
American Fleet?” It was pointed out, a
month ago, to the responsible heads, that
the schools were given a week’s holiday when
the American Fleet arrived, and hence were
full of enthusiasm. But of course the feeble
department could not give our schools a
week’s holiday to celebrate the coming home
of Our Own Fleet; nevertheless, having
in this and other ways shown only luke-
warm interest, it coolly wondered at the
lack of enthusiasm. The Education De-
partment badly wants a virile Australian
administrator to stop the dry-rot which
afflicts it. Incidentally, an angry, indignant
Australian, such as the writer, may perhaps
be pardoned for wondering whether our de-
partmental heads and public men were
leagued in a conspiracy with the Federal
Liberal authorities to damn our Labor-
created Fleet’s home-coming with anaemic
interest, wishy-washy welcome and grossly
bungled arrangements.

for the same old bits of furniture and fur-

a conservative-appetited family? If he

ter take the ’ole lot and mind ’em. I ain’t
’ad a evening off proper nor a day neither,
’cept when I’d be laid up, since I had me first
baby—and that’s more’n 10 year ago.” A very
ordinary, unsensational statement about a
trade that knows no eight hours, and whose
unending work is scheduled by no wages
board. If it would give that woman any
joy to shift the time-payment piano into the
scullery, and put the coal scuttle on the
front room mantel, then, I say, let her!

“11. Singemoine” on romance, etc.: —
A promising’ romance appears to have been assas-
sinated, practically at birth, by the accidental death
of a child in France. It appeared in evidence,
according to the cable, that the child had been run
over by a motor-car driven by Princess Sophia of
Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, with whom were her mother
and Hans Bleichroder, her lover. But the Princess
is supposed to have been dead for the past month or
more. A circumstantial story was cabled in Septem-
ber, telling how she had been refused permission to
marry her Jewish admirer ; how she had shot herself
in despair; how it was reported, at first, that she
had died of heart-failure; and how Bleichroder had
hurried to, her side, but had been forbidden to attend
the funeral. Apparently the suicide story is a fabri-
cation, concocted with the idea that it is better that
a German Princess should be exposed to the world
as a, suicide than that she should marry or have a
liaison with a middle-class Jew. It is possible, on the
other hand, that the lady really is dead, and that
the inquest on her victim was unconscionably post-
poned for some reason. The romance of the suicide
vanishes just the same. Evidently she slew herself,
not because she feared separation from her Israelite
adorer, but because she knew that the fact of her
having killed the child would cause scandal in the
circumstances. About 99 per cent, of romantic
tragedies peter out in this disappointing way. The
Princess whom we were prepared to class with
Heloise turns out to be dashing about the country
with the allegedly heart-broken Yid, who had been
represented as tearing distractedly across Europe to
her funeral. An Austrian prince is for years
mourned as dead, killed by his own hand, and in
the end is identified living in happy obscurity with
his wife and family, in a humble Harlem (U.S.A.)
flat. A distinguished soldier is told, by one even
more distinguished, that the hemlock awaits him.
The world hears that he has done the right thing,
and blown his brains out. Shortly after, people
begin to meet him in China, in Peru, in Mexico —in
all sorts of out-of-the-way spots; or to think they
do. The moral is that it takes a dashed lot to
make healthy human beings shoot themselves. By
the way, I have for some time foreseen that motor-
car driving by girls will hit up the immorality
figures in the next few years. Morals are a question
even more of opportunity than of climate, and the
girl who drives her own car will get more oppor-
tunity in a week than her grandmother did in a
year. Human nature being the weak and erring
thing it is, the ear-driving girl is bound, in certain
cases, to take at least some of her chances. How-
ever, if she subsequently makes an honest man of
her companion there is no reason why anyone
should complain.
News of a generally-unsuspected result of
is cabled from America. Ihe
New York police have announced that a
marl who accused himself of three dozen
aw f u i murders is suffering from opium-
mania. He merely imagined that he had
been having a great, gory time. _ This seems
to explain the hang-dog expression of the
average Chow velegatable vendor. Under the
influence of the after-effects of opium he is
suffering remorse for the murders he didn t
commit. » » *

Alpar : I have a grievance that I d e
to ventilate, in a few words, if you wouldn t
mind. We N. S. Wales country teachers
were i n f orm ed, through the Public Instruc-
Gazette, that we were not to close our
schools on Eight-Hour Day. bo 1 went
along to my seminary, and found the men
all lying around idle, and nary a child at
school. A few of my best friends looked at
me with a pained expression, but 1 didn t
mind, as, like the late H Nelson. 1 had a
duty to perform. I hung on to that bit or duty
valiantly until midday, and then set out tor
home. Passing a group of workers, some-
body called Blackleg, and I feel that I
have gone and got myselt disliked by the
parents. Hundreds of teachers are in the
same boat as I am, and Id like to know
whose fault it is. It was an ill-advised,
wretched business ; and I hope 111 never
have another holiday like it.
Vox : Sydney has no statue of the Royal
George to decorate on days of national re-
joicing, so the best the Government can do
is to hire a few dozen pot plants and stand
them on the grass-plot surrounding his
grandma’s statue in Queen’s Place. Viewed
from a passing tramcar, this makes it ap-
pear as if the lady with the down-pointed
sceptre is holding an auction sale in aid of
something or other, possibly another statue.
She seems to find buyers, too. for ji cart
calls next day and removes the crockery.
THE END OF THE MODERN ROMANCE.
“And they hved happily ever after."
The Commonwealth military authorities
lately pitched a long-overdue bomb into the
hull of the venerable maritime superstition
that the artillery in the Sydney fortifications
is tnaintained purely as a laughing stock
for cantankerous skippers. Formerly the
gunners used to get a bit of practice with
live shot occasionally—if "they were lucky
enough to catch the sea clear of shipping of
every sort. On one occasion the dis-
gusted artillerymen had to stand by for an
hour while a wretched mud-punt lumbered
leisurely across the firing line; and on
another they were held up till their nerves
were raw while a big passenger liner drifted
into Watson’s Bay for medical inspection.
On April 25 the A.G.A. were booked for
battle practice at 10 a.m. They couldn’t
get a start till 1 p.m., and when they did
start they were so interrupted that they
didn’t fire their last shot till 5 o’clock —
seven hours for a job that would have been
done in an hour but for the shipping which
gaily sailed across the line of fire. The last
straw arrived when some skippers had the
cheek to complain to the Navigation Depart-
ment that firing didn’t stop the instant they
heaved above the horizon. The Military
authorities reckoned that was too strong, so
they intimated their intention of enforcing
paragraphs 71 and 72 of the Defence Act
which give the officer in charge
of any artillery or rifle range power to stop
all traffic within the danger zone during
practice. As a penaltv of £5O hangs to a
breach of the law, perhaps the casual skipper
will be a bit less bumptious in future.

Not long back, what was hailed as the
first real eugenic marriage took place in
Massachusetts (U.S.A.), both parties reck-
oning their mating was in strict accord with
scientific principles, and that the usual sen-
timental influences were not main factors.
Now comes word that the unsentimental
bridegroom has paid a hurried visit to the
nearest police station, complaining of an
assault by a strange man whom he had
found with his wife in the eugenic sitting-
room. It had turned out just like a heap of
the common or weed variety of matrimonial
speculations—only sooner.

The latest proposal to make some public
use of Greycliffe, the old Wentworth house
at Vaucluse, is to fix it up as the official
residence of N.S.W. Chief Justices. Some
parties have discovered a sense of unfitness
in having the Chief Justices of the State
living here and there, in rented houses or
in houses that are being bought on time-
payment. But why the Chief Justice any
more than other Judges? Certainly if the
State Governorship were abolished and the
Chief Justice handled the rubber stamp, Grey-
cliffe might be thrown in. Otherwise there
seems to be no good reason for supplementing
the salary of the “Chief,” which is already
quite high enough, compared with the pay of
the other Judges—often equally eminent
lawyers. The “Chief” gets £3500 a year;
the puisnes, £2600. Only one C.J. of
N.S.W. has had an official, rent-free State
residence, built and furnished by the Govern-
ment. That was Forbes, who lived in a
ramshackle building on or near the site of
the present Lands Office. It was contem-
plated at that time that the C.J. should
always be provided with a residence; but
the salary was small in those days.
Melbourne University professors have
been talking of late about “tutorial classes”
for university extension lectures. A pro-
fessor’s lofty manner of referring to “tutorial
classes” reminds one of George Willoughby’s
high-toned butler in “The Night of the
Party,” who buttled for nobody of less im-
portance than a duke ; and always spoke of
footmen as persons in a '“senatorial capa-
city.”
Westralia’s Arbitration Court President,
Judge Burnside, is now probably cured of
his habit of holding long conversations with
lady witnesses. His custom has been to dis-
cuss at length the cheapest way to provide a
dinner, or how best to cook salt junk, the
while, of course, fishing for information on
the cost of living. The other day, a she-clerk
said that to dress well cost her £5O a year;
and no sooner had his Honor expressed sur-
prise than the lady dived into particulars,
and before the loud coughs of the Bench had
drowned her voice, she had given a full
account of —of everything. Burnside blushed
profusely as he protested that he did not
want all these details; but he got them,
nevertheless.

“Carmine”: London reports a great slump
in modern pictures, chiefly through the
American craze for Old Masters, and no
doubt those who take advantage of it to
snap up accredited moderns will ultimately
make money. Landseer’s “Otter Hunt,”
which cost 10,000 guineas, was sold lately
for 1200. It will never go much above that.
Stanfield’s “Wooden Walls of Old England,”
bought for 2700 guineas some years ago, is
sold now for 160. Tadema, Prout, Rosa
Bonheur and many others have shrivelled
greatly. Tadema will probably never be
worth more than half his top prices—he is
regarded now chiefly as a decorator. Rosa
Bonheur will not lift much. Stanfield’s “Off
Calais” has fallen from lluO guineas to 58.
But it is worth more, and might be looked up
at (say) 100 for Sydney, Melbourne, Ade-
laide or Ballarat. “On The Lagoon” goes
down from 1900 to 52, and “View Near Ser-
polina” from 1060 to 205. Tadema’s “Old,
Old Story” slumps from 1150 to 370, and
“Garland Seller,” a thin thing, from 1120 to
235. Yet I don’t recommend anyone to sell
even mining shares and buy Tademas. Mel-
bourne has an awfully expensive little one,
worth about a sixth part of cost. Prout
has sold at less than 100 guineas each. What
a gamble it is. There was, on the other
side, poor Romney. He gave his “Lady
Pole” and another picture for 160 guineas,
and the “Lady Pole” has lately fetched
£41,370.
SIC TRANSIT!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I burnt your letters, for, alas!
Cupid, in lieu of rose and dove,
Brought marriage—such a paltry,’ small,
And somewhat acid fruit of love!
Two pillow-cases full there were;
They voiced your heart in every phase
Passionate, tender, joyous, proud;
The moods of bygone, amorous days.
I burnt them in the copper fire
Last Monday ; page on page that thrilled
Blazed up and made the copper boil,
With a week’s household washing’ filled.
Yet something of them still survives,
For, flotsam of our passion’s wreck,
The ribbons once around them tied
Make bows for our black kitten’s neck !

THE BREAKING OF THE DROUGHT.
[For The Bulletin.]
The Postmaster-General has promised to consider a
request made by the Licensed Victuallers’ Associa-
tion of Australasia for permission to send liquor
through the post. —News item.
The post arrives but once a week
Outback at Barrengums;
Wild hopes and fears commingled fill
The rough, big-hearted shearers till
At last the mailman comes.
Strong men, their eyes aflood with tears,
Turn out and welcome him with cheers!
«
Each eagerly his “letter” elaims —-
Some lucky ones get two —
And lo ! their joy knows no restraint,
While they proceed the place to paint
A bright vermilion hue.
Thus, weekly, in their simple way,
They celebrate red-letter day.
VICTORIA.

AN EPILEPTIC FIT.
A famous London physician, who for years
made a study of this disease, has, after a number of
experiments, found a prescription which affords re-
lief in almost a marvellous manner. This has been
put on the market by Mr. I. W. Nicholl, Pharmaceu-
tical Chemist, of Belfast, under the name of
“Ozerine,” and the number of unsolicited testimonials
received speak well for its efficiency as a remedy
against this appalling disease. Your chemist can
easily get it for you.*

PERSONAL
ITEMS
Alf Edden, N.S.W. Minister for Mines,
has been giving the ladies’ branch of the
Glebe Labor League a little of his personal
history. Before he was 10 he was getting
9d. per day in a coal mine, leaving home
at 5 in the morning and not getting back
until 7.30 at night. He was the youngest of
a family of 14, and he himself had a family
of 14 —13 of them living; one was killed
in a coal mine. Christmas before last he and
his missus, with their sons, their daughters
and their grandchildren, sat down to dinner
35 strong; had they met last Christmas
there would have been 42 of them. The
warrior has been offered £5OO to write his
life, he says, and he thinks he’ll start on
it. In the matter of education there was
very little difference between Mr. Wade and
himself —“he was educated with his books
of logic and his grammar books at the Uni-
versity ; I was educated in a coal mine with
a double-ended pick and a No. 6 shovel.”
THE CAPTURE.
The American Beef Trust is adopting the same
tactics to capture the Australian trade as were used
in the Argentine.— News item.
THE BERFY ONE: "Dear little pet! I knew
it would lead on this string!”
They can’t keep out of it! Hall-Jones,
ex-Minister for Public Works, ex-Premier,
ex-High Commissioner for Maoriland, has
accepted a seat in that country’s Leg. Coun-
cil. Jones not long ago called on Exalted
Heaven to witness his retirement from poli-
tics. He’s been in them more or less for
about a quarter of a century, and E. H.
might have been expected to take his word
for it. But the witness was silent. It
mostly is when the voluntary retirement of
actresses and politicians is mentioned.
Tom Quinlan, the Napoleon of the Grand
Opera Co., is a native of Bury, in Lanca-
shire, but comes of a Tipperary family. As
a youngster he had a sound musical educa-
tion, and began as choir boy, after which he
developed a fine, mellow baritone. Then,
with a view to a life-crust, he became ap-
prenticed to an accountant, and followed
figures for several years, though pursuing
a musical education all the time. His know-
ledge of accounts brought him his first job
as operatic manager: a friend in that line
invited him to become his partner. Quin-
lan, however, did not long agree with his
friend’s schemes, so bought him right out,
and has been going from big ventures to
bigger ones ever since.
Note from “Jeames” :
The Dudleys have made it up. A year ago there
was talk of a divorce, so hopeless did the rift
appear ; but at this stage the King and Queen, who
are intimately friendly with both parties, waded in
and metaphorically forbade the banns. King Edward
did this in connection with a row which concerned
the present Duke of Westminster, and a somewhat
similar move was made in the case of the Duke of
Marlborough and his wife. There are some noblemen
—the Cowleys, Rosslyns, etc., of Society—who do
not matter. They may be served with citations,
bankruptcy notices, ca. sa. orders and the like every
other week of their lives, without the stability of
the Empire being menaced. . But England’s Marl-
boroughs and Dudleys are out of that class. Since
the beginning of the Dudley row he has been in
Cairo, while she has lived at Witley Court with the
children. The latter are now growing up. Lady
Honor Ward, whom Australians will remember as a
long-legged flapper, has “come out,” and Lord
Ednam, the family heir, will be of age shortly.
Hence the desirability of a reconciliation.
A FRIENDLY SUGGESTION.
Mr. Cook states that his Government proposes to
raise a loan of £3,000,000. —News item.
BULI COHEN: “Oh , yes, I'll fix you tip all
right, Mr. Cook; but aren’t you afraid
the N.S. W. Labor Government will be
saying you're stealing its policy ?"
John Dennistoun Wood, now in Tasmania,
is the oldest living Victorian Executive
Councillor; he was appointed March 11,
1857, when he was made Solicitor-General in
the first O’Shanassy Ministry. The next in
seniority, with a break of 18 years between,
is Chief Justice Madden, who became Minis-
ter of Justice under James McCulloch, in
1875.
Of all rich men left in South Aus. Robert
Barr Smith’s most serious rival is Carl
Blume, of Mount Gambier. If he passes
hence in the midst of a good season he will
probably pan out at well over a million.
Sheep have been his downfall. Some time
ago he handed two sons £160,000 each and
told them to go out and earn their own
living, after the manner of the father in the
parable, who gave the Prodigal Son £2OO in
notes of the Bank of Jerusalem, and in-
formed him that he had got swelled head
and had better strike out for himself.
Wilbur Glenn Voliva, Elijah 111., _ and
successor to Elijah of the Purple Wings,
has gone one better than his predecessor in
Zion City. Dowie only got as far as to
appoint the first of the Twelve Apostles;
that was himself. He promised to name the
rest in due course. His fatal madness, how-
ever, intervened. Voliva has just got the
ecclesiastical lasso on two more of the
Twelve, and they were duly consecrated at
the recent Feast of Tabernacles. One of
them is a missionary from Japan named
Royall; the other rejoices in the name of
Eustace Lawford Carey. Carey was cap-
tured in Melbourne by Voliva himself, and
is more than his right hand to the present
dictator of Zion. He is the son of a well-
known Melbourne minister, and, when fished
up from the sea of Australian iniquity, was
manager of the Northcote branch of one of
the Melbourne banks. The leader of the
Melbourne Zionites kicked up a row over the
coming to light of these two brand-new
apostles, and straightway resigned. Even a
man who can create Apostles at will has his
troubles.
The estate of the late Rowland Ferrers
Pickering pays probate duty on £15,761.
“Rowley” Pickering was sporting editor of
the Sydney Mail for many years, but his
little fortune didn’t come from his pen. His
mother and a couple of uncles —the late
Eyre Goulburn Ellis, solicitor, and Thomas
Ellis, auctioneer —left it (or most of it) to
him.
Peter Bowling’s fiery glim has been
doused once more. After leading the New-
castle miners in the disastrous strike of a
few years back, Peter met reversals that
induced him to gravitate to the Illawarra
coal district, where he became the miners’
general secretary. His enkindling policy did
not pan out any better in the South than it
did in the North, and at a recent ballot for
the billet Peter came a bad third.
Engineer Alfred Williams, who died
lately, aged 79, came to N.S.W. in 1865 to
boss the construction of the railway bridge
over the Nepean at Penrith. Later, being
appointed to the Harbors and Rivers De-
partment, he supervised the building of
ivjLan-o’-War Steps and the retaining wall at
Farm Cove, and gave an eye to many re-
clamation works and divers wharves and
jetties. Sir Edward Leader Williams, the
designer of the Manchester (Eng.) Ship
Canal, who died in 1910, was his eldest
brother.
Thomas Parker Reeve, who died at Stan-
more (N.S.W.) on Friday, in his 90th year,
was a very old Sydney business man. In
the very first ’so’s he established himself in
George-street as a general dealer, in hard-
ware chiefly, his neighbor on the south being
Anthony Hordern, draper, in a small way
then. This was Anthony 11., father of the
late Sam Hordern. Mr. Reeve continued
there for many years, and then, retiring,
gave himself up mostly to philanthropic and
church work.
Died last week J. J. Duncan, leader since
1901 of the Conservative party in the S.
Aus. House of Landlords. Of late years
the crowd behind him called itself the Lib-
eral party; but Duncan, as a dead-straight
man, never liked the new title. The fairly
well-to-do men with whom S. Aus. started
were, on the whole, a good lot; and Dun-
can’s family, which was among them, did
some very estimable things. His father was
a partner of W. W. Hughes, and the young-
ster was on the firm’s squattage on Yorke’s
Peninsula when Moonta was discovered. He
carried the good news to the old people, who
were made rich men by it. Later on a good
cut out of the money went in endowing
some of the first chairs established at the
Adelaide University.
The travelled Australian always seems to
get to the top in the countries he settles in.
Medico-General P. J. 11. Farrell, a Braid-
wood < N.S.W.) boy, long resident in the
United States, a noted soldier of many cam-
paigns, and a big practitioner of Chicago, has
been appointed by the Wilson Administra-
tion as Governor-General of the Philippine
Islands. This is about the biggest thing,
next to Dr. Morrison’s China organisation
job, that an Australian has ever struck out-
side his own little island. The popular “Pat”
Farrell will be only a fortnight’s sail from
his own native Braidwood soon, and might
pop down one of these days in a Yankee
cruiser, with a Philippino band and a star-
spangled banner, and say “Howdy” to bis
old friends.
NEW SOUTH WALES PAYS A VISIT
TO THE POLITICAL GRAVEYARD .
After 37 years’ residence in the aw T ful
Northern Territory, William Seaman Mar-
stin has given up chasing the elusive dwt. in
this mullocky world. “Old Bill" had
sampled various countries before dropping
anchor in the N.T., which he reckoned just
It. He had reached the age of 75 years
when he was served with the notice.
The local paper reports the death in the
Albury Hospital of John Burnett of the
Upper Murray, at the age of 777. aw
Bulletin hates to doubt its contemporaries •
nevertheless it believes that this storv is
exaggerated. J
AGAR WYNNE ,
Postmaster- General.
“Kiwi’s” ap-
preciation in
brief:—
Although louseph
Ward went out of
power as beaten as
man well could be
he is again far and
away the most popu-
lar person in Maori-
land, and but wants
a general election to
prove it. He has the
most admirable qual-
ities in getting out
of trouble. Seddon
was a stronger man,
but never had the
same capacity as
Ward for endearing
himself to those lie
met. And the lOU
gentleman is enor-
mously shrewd. He
well manned the de-
partments of State
with heads attached
to him, and on whom
he could rely for a
masterly and sympa-
thetic opposition to a
new Government, the
possibility of which
he foresaw two years
before the last gen-
eral election. When
the Balance-Seddon
party took office the
first difficulty it had
to contend with was
an antagonistic Civil
Service. The same
position is now ex-
istent, with the vast
difference that Mas-
sey and company
have not the ability
and strength to con-
tend with it.
A couple of rival collectors of Australian
history are now at work in Sydney, both
among the musty, grimy records of the
Supreme Court —-Robert McNab, the Maori-
land historian, and Dr. Watson, the Com-
monwealth historian. McNab has been suc-
cessful in discovering a number of valuable
MSS. bearing upon early Maoriland, and
Watson is putting the top bricks on a new
history he has been building.
Mrs. Hester Manning, who died the other
day at Marrickville (N.S.W.), was widow
of Arthur Wilcox Manning, brother of Jus-
tice William Montagu Manning and son
of John Edye Manning, an early Registrar
of the Supreme Court. A. W. Manning
was Under-Secretary in the Chief Secre-
tary’s office in Queensland in 1868, when he
was assaulted with a tomahawk by a sus-
pended C.P.S. The C.P.S. got penal servi-
tude for life; Manning three months later
got a pension of £6OO a year. Everyone
believed that he had retired to die, but he
lived for another 32 years.
Australia is in temporary possession of
two more of those unaccountable persons
who trapse round the earth on their uppers,
so to speak, relying on the good offices of
the occasional stranger for a crust. Mrs.
Hilda Gilbert, of N’York, is supposed to be
trying to win 5000 dollars from Jack Lon-
don by earning her way about the world.
Pitta Ryan, one of seven Edmonton (Can-
ada) newsboys, is on the same sort of lurk.
He is pledged to circumnavigate the globe
inside five years as from April 28, T 2.
The countries that encourage this sort of
foolishness deserve all the annoyance they
get from it, like the people who help to carry
on “chain-prayers” and similar futilities.
Francis Conway, whose executors have
paid probate duty on £136,000, was a Mel-
bourne cobbler who stuck to his last. He
began and ended in a Prahran bootshop,
and rarely looked beyond a stone’s-throw
from the local town hall for an investment.
In his young days he hawked boots up and
down Chapel-street, and there he opened his
first shop, near the spot where the old Town
Hall was subsequently built. As his business
increased he opened another bootery or two
in the same street, and as he prospered he
put his spare capital into land and house
property thereabouts. When the land boom
smashed, people continued to w r ear boots, so
Conway was still able to snap up bargains
in real estate. But the soul of the ex-pedlar
never expanded. In his old age he still de-
lighted to dust his goods and sweep the pave-
ment in front of his shop, whilst Prahran
reverenced him for his suburban dullness
and his growing riches. In fact, it was
greatly disappointed on learning that its
ancient bootseller had left only £136,000.
and he is 1 now suspected of having handed
over a lot of his possessions to Holy Church
to ensure his safety hereafter.
INCOMPATIBILITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ex-King Manoel, of Portugal, and his wife, who
separated before their honeymoon was over, are still
estranged. In Vienna Court circles it is not believed
that anything beyond a nominal reconciliation has
been effected. Incompatibility of temper is said to
be the cause of the estrangement.— Cable.
When plain Jim Smith and Mrs. Smith
Take up the tongs and two or three
Odd cups to smite each other with —
That’s incompatibility !
To coin a better phrase to fit it
The hapless couple do not “hit it.”
But in the royal households, rare
Are such things known. With vicious zest
They do not swipe each other there
With stewpan or with kitchen chair.
Which gives this Manoel affair
An extra ; special interest.
We have a vision of the king
(That used to be) at 3 p.m.
Enthroned upon the mat to sing
Some weird, distracting, ragtime gem,
The while his spouse, the point to settle,
Essays to stun him with the kettle.
In Smith’s poor, plebeian house, we fear,
A common feature this may be,
■Where hubby comes home on his ear,
And brings a noble load of beer ;
But rarely in the royal sphere
Does such a vulgar thing appear
As incompatibility.
Divinity that hedges kings
Left this one when he lost his job,
And papers hint at awful things
As if he were a common yob,
As if his queen (as should have been),
Forgetting to be sweet and tender,
Might part his whiskers with the fender,
And both might sit the breakfast through,
Exchanging plates and mockery
As mere suburban couples do.
It knocks our loyal dreams askew,
And leaves us curious to view
All bills for royal crockery.
VICTORIA.

For many years N. S. Wales has had two Savings
Banks, one generally known as the Post Office and
the other as the Barrack-street institution. The
one under notice was the Post Office Bank, and when
the Commonwealth took over the Post Office it should
also have taken over the bank. But it didn’t; in-
stead, the State was permitted to carry on business
at the old stands until the Commonwealth Govern-
ment established a Savings branch of its own. Then
this State Bank had to shift out, and during the
last few months it has been busy jerrying up tem-
porary banking premises on the handiest vacant
blocks it could lay its hands on. For the moment,
therefore, there are three Savings Banks in N. S.
Wales—this straight-out State institution ; the one
that has its head-office in Barrack-street, Sydney,
and is controlled by trustees who know very well
that the State would have to come again to their
rescue if they got into difficulties, as they once did ;
and the Savings branch of the Commonwealth Bank.
It is an absurd and wasteful multiplication ; and it
won’t be very much better when presently the bank
which is a State Bank and admits it and the other
bank that fs a State Bank and won’t admit it are
amalgamated. *
No figures show the prosperity of N. S. AVales

1906 . . 9,322,923 | 1912 . . 20,128,598
The increase in 10 years is nearly threefold. But it
isn’t altogether a matter to give three cheers about.
If the country had earned this money it would be
magnificent. But it hasn’t; it has borrowed most of
it, and will have to repay it, and until it does repay
it interest will have to be found somewhere. On
June 30, 1903, the public debt of N. S. Wales was
£77,692,987 ; on June 30, 1913, it was
£106,170.747. Thus in 10 years the State has bor-
rowed £28,477,760, and other large amounts have
been invested or otherwise borrowed for private pur-
poses. It hasn’t all been foreign money, but a great
deal of it has been. The bulk of the money bor-
rowed by the State has been put into public works;
and those works have cost just as much if they will
return only 1 p.c. as if they would give 5 p.c. In
fact, they will give only a wretched return in some
cases because the money spent on them has been
grossly excessive. A good deal of this Savings Bank
money is money that has been spent on such works
—and the State would be better off if it hadn’t
been spent and if it hadn’t therefore been available
for the bank to get hold of. Of course the borrowing
hasn’t been wholly responsible for the big increase
in the deposits. Good seasons and bigger wage-
earnings have had a lot to do with it. And in this
connection it has to be remembered that high prices
have come with high wages, wherefore the
£20,000,000 of deposits to-day are probablv worth
no more to their owners than £15,000,000 would
have been in, say, 1900. From several points of
view, then, the increase in denosits, while, of course,
very satisfactory, is nothing like so cheerful a cir-
cumstance as it looks.
The next list shows what is done with the de-
posits and other resources :

The fact that three-fourths of all the resources of
the bank are lent to the State Government explains
why the State Government fought like a bag of cats
against the proposal to transfer this bank, as well
as the other departments of the Post Office, to the
Commonwealth. In times when the regular money-
lending Cohen is shy, it is a blessed relief to a dis-
tracted Treasurer to be able to dip his hand into
such a till as this; and the people who control it
are the only people who can dip into it. Besides
helping to finance the Government the bank also
finances the Advances to Settlers Department, which
had its origin in the old Advances to Settlers Board
—an institution designed by politicians for the re-
lief of needy farming constituents. The Advances
Department is now on a sound business footing ; it is
managed by a Board of three, headed by an experi-
enced banker. The same Commissioners control the
Savings Bank Department of the bank, and there
seems no good reason why the two departments
should be even nominally kept separate.
The Advances Department shows these results: —

’Tie amount which this lending department owes to
the Savings branch is including
accrued interest. Of this, however, only £1,420,559
is lent out on mortgage. The balance, along with
some old funded-stock money, is nearly all lent to
still another branch —the Closer Settlement Promo-
tion Department. It’s a clumsy business. The
Savings Bank proper doesn’t lend money to settlers.
It lends to the Advances Department, which does
the lending. But the Advances Department doesn’t
lend to all settlers; there are some to whom only
the Closer Settlement Promotion Department will
lend. So after the Savings branch has borrowed
from the public, the Advances branch borrows from
the Savings branch, and then the Closer Settlement
branch borrows from the Advances branch, and the
public gets its bite. There must be a nice little lot
of book-keeping in all this, stupid circumlocution.
Under the Closer Settlement Promotion Act
(1910) “any three or more persons who are quali-
fied to make and hold settlement purchases’’ may
borrow “the whole or part of the purchase money”
of private land they are acquiring, provided that
(1) all the land is bought from one vendor, and (2)
the price does not exceed the valuation of the
Closer Settlement Advisory Board and the Savings
Bank Commissioners. But since no sane banker
would advance 100 p.c. of the purchase price, the
Commissioners require to be guaranteed against loss
by the Government, which undertakes to make any
deficit good out of the Consolidated Revenue. These
advances cost the borrowers only 44 p.c. When the
daring measure was passed the interest was fixed at
4 pc.; but as the Department is now paying that
much the Minister carried an amending Bill, under
which he can charge anything not less than 4 p.c.
Since January ] of this year 44 p.c. has been
charged. The money advanced and owing amounts
to £689,744, and the profit for the year was £783
—the only provision for the bad debts which it is
pretty certain the Department won’t escape. Only
remarkably good management backed up by remark-
ably good luck can, indeed, save the Government
from pretty heavy losses over this business.

The latest transfer of reserves brings the capital up
to £300,000, of which no less than £232,314 has
been paid up out of accumulated profits since 1904.
This makes the present comparatively modest-looking
131 P-C. dividend really equal to one of 60 p.c. on
the capital actually paid by shareholders. Even
assuming that all the capital prior to 1904 had come
out of shareholders’ pockets, it’s a glorious
example of what a well-managed fire insurance office
can accomplish once it gets over the early struggles.
The infantile mortality among fire offices is, how-
ever, very large; of a considerable litter of such cos.
born about the same time as the South British
(1872), three out of every five are now gone and
forgotten. The tendency with the infant is to
attempt to cover a continent while it can only com-
fortably cater for its own native town, and that is
generally the end of it. And pretty often the young
insurance hopeful tries to attract attention by pay-
ing dividends much bigger than it can afford, which
simply hastens the disappearance. When they don’t
do that, and consequently live and thrive, they
mostly endeavor in a few years to smother the
dividends so as not to attract attention.
The premium income has taken another leap during
the year. But still the insurer is exceptionally well
protected. Premiums for the year were £415,507,
and shareholders’ funds (capital and reserves), after
the dividend had been paid, amounted to £754,365,
or 181.5 p.c. of the premiums, a remarkably strong
position, notwithstanding the very rapid growth of
business, and therefore of risks. The next table
shows that growth and a few other things:—

1913.. 415,507 231,701 119,796 55.7 „ 28.8 „
Under ordinary circumstances the loss rate would be
regarded as excessive ; but this co. does a big marine
business (it used to be the South British Fire and
Marine In. Co.), and that means big risks, although
not much expense in getting the business. So the
expense rate, taken all round, is low, and would be
still lower if the co. didn’t chase business practi-
cally all over the world.
Of its total assets of £884,976, the South British
has no less than £259,521 in premises and property
and £274,863 out on mortgage. The balance is held
in public securities (principally those of Australia
and Maoriland) and liquid assets. Interest and rent
earnings for the past year amounted to £39,006, so
only £lOOO had to come from underwriting profits
to pay the dividend. The rest, of course, is put aside
to earn more, and meantime is available to meet
claims. The big lay-by then attracts new business
while keeping the old ; and the new business, well-
selected, means more profit; and more profit means
more money to lay-by; and that means still more
business. And so it goes on. There is hardly any
stopping the fire insurance co. once it takes root.

This co.’s life js limited, wherefore there is a sink-
ing fund for the return of capital. On June 30 this
fund, which is included among the reserves, amounted
to £25,206: £22,617 of it was in bank deposits
and other liquid assets, and the balance in land.
As the table shows, £26,250, being one-fourth of the
capital, was returned six years ago ; and there being
now in hand sufficient to pay back another fourth,
the transaction, according to present arrangements, •
will be carried through on January 1 next. This
will leave £52,500 of capital in the business. When
that £26,250 is repaid, the profits will shrink by
(say) £l2OO ; on the other hand, an 8 p.c. div.
with call for only £4200 instead of £6300. The
margin of profits in excess of dividend should there-
fore be a bit wider than it is now; and it is com-
fortably wide already, seeing that in 1908 it was
computed that an annual £3020 would be sufficient
to complete the fund for the return of capital in the
required time. The co. apparently hasn’t got much
in the wav of extra business profits to look forward
to ; for gross trading revenue is. less now than it was
10 years ago, probably on account of keener elec-
trical competition, while expenses are a shade higher.

When this co. was last inspected four years ago it
was told that it would probably get into trouble;
and the trouble has arrived all right. Plain mis-
management has had most to do with it—plain mis-
management added perhaps to poor co-operation.
Four years ago the co. was told that things would
not be likely to mend till it left off its stupid plan
of having a Board of 11 directors. There are 11
directors still. If there were five or even three the
co. would have a tar better chance. As it is, the
bad debts have been appalling—just as one would
expect them to be. Also the cost of management,
etc , has been absurdly high ; and with a cumber-
some Board of 11 one would expect that to be so,
too. A new manager has been put in lately, and he
is said to have been given a free hand. If so, the
thing may have a chance, provided the members
stick to their own co. But it had better clear the
deficit right out, and be done with it. As far as
can be seen most of the loss shown during the last
couple of years really belongs to years back ; bad
debts have been kept on the books which ought to
have been provided for long ago. To straighten
things up capital should be written off— £ 2 per
share will do it. Certainly there won’t be much
ordinary capital left then —something under £7OOO
—but the money has been lost, and the sooner the
loss is buried and out of sight the better for the
business, and the fairer to the new man who is ex-
pected to make a success of it. But the manager
can’t make a success of it alone. He must have the
backing of the co-operators ; and the co-operators
shouldn’t need to be whipped or wheedled into send-
ing their business that way, as they have had to be,
judging by the amount spent on salaries, travelling
and motor expenses.
The capital would be too small for the business
even if it were intact, which it isn’t. Of ordinary
capital there is, or was, £23,027, of which £15,000-
odd has been lost; the pref. capital is £B4l7 —say
altogether £16,000 intact. The deposits, over-
drafts, and other liabilities amount to £64,327. Of
the total of these two items £36,624 is represented
by book debts (including bills), £23,657 by mer-
chandise stock, and the balance by property, plant,
etc. The co. is over-trading; and since it is most
unlikely that more capital could be got in on favor-
able terms at present, the co. had better for a while
go back on its tracks, push its cash trading, reduce
its stocks (it is apparently trying to cover too many
lines) and cut a few thousands off its expenses. In-
cidentally it will, of course, do no more gambling
in grain ; and finally it may pray that it may be
spared a repetition of the floods which last year, it
is said, cost it one way and another about £3OOO.

Compared with the money out at risk in advances,
the capital is small ; but the reserves are so solid
that there would have to be either a very sudden
and severe slump or shocking mismanagement to put
the share capital in danger; and there would have
to be a much worse slump or simply appalling mis-
management before the deposits could be affected.
Further, the shareholders (whose capital matures in
a certain period and is then withdrawable) are en-
titled to view with great satisfaction the fine margin
of profit left over after the 84 p.c. div. is provided
for. It probably won’t last, being due no doubt to
the recent keen demand for money at high rates;
but the substantial lay-by will make it easier to
pay good divs. in future—provided the management
isn’t lending on too high a basis of values. That
mistake would, of course, mean foreclosures and pro-
bably the loss of reserves when the securities came
to be realised later on.

The growth of the profits during the past few years
has been very remarkable; it suggests that, notwith-
standing the very heavy writing-down in 1906-7,
something more went for a while towards the reduc-
tion of book values. Properties in possession were
the millstone round the co.’s neck; but during
Queensland’s long run of fine seasons so much of the
millstone has been got rid of that what remains is
little more than an ornament. Altogether, these
foreclosed freeholds stand now in the balance-sheet
for only £7112 ; and, considering how Brisbane pro-
perty values have moved up during the last few
years, the chances are that a profit is shown on such
sales as have been made of late. Anyway, it is
scarcely likely that the properties have realised their
exact book-value; while if a loss had been made it
would presumably be shown like it used to be. This
suggests that the management is tucking away a
trifle somewhere to provide for the losses and shrint
ages tnat will come with the inevitable leaner tiii-
Other things suggest even more plainlv that
cautious policy is nowadays adopted—the’ fact b
instance, that, whereas the visible profits are Lji i
to about p.c. on the capital, the directors are std
content to pay a modest 5 p.c. This policy is mi
right one; for, much as Queensland may believe in
its own future, it is dead-certain that for the present
the State’s prosperity depends almost entirely upon its
erratic climate; and while a few good years
add phenomenally to its wealth, one bad’year niav
not merely reduce its income enormously, ’ but also
wipe out millions of its capital. And this co sub'
ject like others to the effects of these fluctuations
has not only its own capital to protect: it has
it 157,803 of deposits as well. That is to sav 0 f
approximately *255,000 put into mortgages ’and
other shrinkable securities (most of the advances no
doubt being given by way of assistance to pur-
chasers), about £145,000 net is other people’s
money ; and the other people will want their money
no matter what happens to the co.’s securities. Tak-
ing these risks, the shareholder ought no doubt to
get a good deal more than 5 p.c., as things are; but
he must be prepared to wait and let it come later on
through the building up of solid reserves. Solid
reserves mean public confidence; and in a business of
this sort public confidence is what the fattest divi-
dends are fed on.
Arthur Cocks & Co., Ltd., was formed
in 1911 to take over a business established by the
present Mayor of Sydney, who, about 15 years’ ago
set himself up as a wholesale trader in optical
goods. For goodwill £12,000 was paid in shares bv
the co., and that and flotation exes, represent the
deficit with which the co. started:—

There is a bad debts fund of £1269; if this is
reckoned as a reserve, the deficit (that is, the cap-
ital not represented by tangible assets) is reduced to
£5174. The sums which have been put to this
fund have not been treated as profits in the fore-
going table. The capital is now £19,520 preference
and £54,093 ordinary; and in addition to this
money there is £42,664 of the public’s in the busi-
ness, including £13,000 of fixed deposits and
£10,693 of deposits at call—the latter a rather
unusual means of financing a trading business of
this sort. Circumstances alter cases, no doubt; but
in general it wouldn’t be a very safe or satisfactory
method of finance. At the end of July the co.
had resources as follows: Capital, £73,613; liabili-
ties, £42,664; undivided profits and bad debts re-
serve, £9755; total, £126,032. To represent this
it had £66,882 in stocks, £38,146 in book debts,
£4557 in cash, and £4134 in fittings and sundries.
The other £12,313 is in goodwill and alterations
and improvements to leased premises. There is no
loading in the shape of a leasehold asset. Probably
the vendors did not think any of the co.’s leaseholds
worth any more than they were paying for them.
If they did they gave the co. the benefit of it. It
will be seen that practically all the capital is repre-
sented bv stock and the small cash balances; to
finance the business—or, rather, to allow the co. to
finance its customers—the co. has to rely on deposits
and other liabilities. There is nothing in freeholds
and very little in plant and fittings. The fact that
all the capital is in stock and none in freeholds
means, of course, that the shares are not at all a
gilt-edged investment; but it also means that on a
comparatively small capital a big turnover is pos-
sible. And that means or ought to mean fine profits.
These profits are to a great extent governed by the
stock-taking; and, (hough there is nothing about it
in the official report, it was said on very good
authority a while ago that, on a reva'luation, stocks
at one branch had been written down considerably
below the value fixed at the 1912 stocktaking. This
would mean that the profit for 1911-12 was inflated,
the 1912-13 figures having to suffer in consequence.
Head office is in Sydney ; there are branches in Mel-
bourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, and in Maoriland and
England. There is a heap of energy in the main-
springs of the business. The managing director is
the sort of man who decided that he would like to
be Mayor of Sydney, and within six years was Mayor
of Sydney, though up to that time he hadn’t taken
any interest in municipal matters. No doubt there
are other rood men in the business; still when a
big sum is paid for goodwill in a case of this sort,
it is just as well to accumulate hard profit and wipe
out that goodwill as auickly as possible, in case of
accidents. There are concerns to which a certain
roodwill value attaches pretty firmly; still if you
want to see how poor an asset goodwill is as a rule,
just turn up a directory of 35 years ago, and reckon
up how manv of the old business houses then thriving
are thriving to-day.

In five years, on a capital of £15,000, the co. has
thus (1) paid its modest 5 p.c. dividend, (2) paid
for renewals and extensions and (3) accumulated
£330. The amount spent on renewals and exten-
sions isn’t visible; but it has probably been fairly
considerable, seeing that 55 per cent, more gas was.
sold last half-year than in the first half of 1908.
The co. seems, therefore, to have more than earned
its dividend, although, with new competition, thing:.
may be cut finer in the future.

Assuming that additions, repairs and renewals have
made the outfit worth as much to-day as it was when
the auditors let the cat out of the bag in 1903 it
follows that the co. is now really £lB 232 heller
off than it was then, though, having now no reserves
wwv. n< V° , Wel i off „ as - to be then!
Whether the plant really is worth as much now as it
was 9i years ago this paper doesn’t know • nor does
it know how much the plant is still overvalued and
how much more writing down has consequently to
be done. All that is plain is that the business looks
very profitable; in fact, if the co. went on for eight
years putting by as much as it has done during the
last couple of years, it could pay off all its debts
and have enough left over to pay back half its capi-
tal. ihe co. owns both gas and electric light works
The latter, which cost over £12.000, now stand in
the books at only £2708, though the profit from
that department last half-year was £363 after pro-
viding for repairs and maintenance.
“P.X.”; A lot of people have been inter-
ested in misrepresenting the new rule of the Svdnev
Stock Exchange, and the Stock Exchange committee
never enters into controversies ; so it is not surpris-
ing that a wrong impression prevails regarding it
The rule gives the committee power to suspend another
rule concerning what is known as buying-in. If mem-
ber Jones sells member Smiff 500 Tin Fleeces and
doesn’t deliver the scrip, on giving a couple of days’
notice Smiff may go on ’Change and buy the Fleeces
at whatever price they are offered at, no matter how
high; and Jones has to pay up. ’This is the oppor-
tunity of a crowd that is cornering a stock ; it can
make Jones pay almost any price it likes if the
corner is strong enough, and if Jones is strong enough
to stand the racket. Now, the Exchange isn’t
created to help men make fictitious prices for scrip ;
in other words, it isn’t part of its functions to
encourage corners, which are merely conspiracies
to get prices in excess of true values.' So it passed
a new rule declaring that the committee should have
power to suspend the buying-in. That is, the com-
mittee said : “You shall not use our rules to further
a conspiracy. If a member has made a contract and
has not kept it, the other party still has his remedy
at law. Let him therefore go to law, and the Judge,
on evidence, will award damages for breach of con-
tract—if he is satisfied that it was a good con-
tract.” The Exchange does not cancel any contract ;
it does not affect or suspend any legal redress, of
course. It simply says: “When our committee has
reason to believe a conspiracy is afoot, the party
who thinks he is aggrieved must go to the courts
and not come to us for redress.”

White Crystal (N.S.W.) holds a sale this
week of shares forfeited for non-payment of first call of
6d. A second call is practically certain for October, and
then no doubt there will be a “machinery” call of

Block 14-Torrington (N.S.W.) has been
milling its wolfram-bismuth ore with 10 head of
stampers. So far, the returns indicate a remarkably
low average extraction of both metals, for the mill
has had to treat from 140 to 150 tons of crude ore
to produce one ton of wolfram-bismuth concentrates.
The percentage of tungstic acid in the concentrates
should be clearly set out; “wolfram” may mean
almost anything. For a recent fortnight’s run the
mill treated 578 tons of crude ore for 3 tons
19cwt. 3qr. 241 b. of concentrates, assaying from
68.56 p.c. to 67.5 p.c. of “wolfram” and from 2.64
p.c. to 2.95 p.c. of bismuth.

Great Cobar’s mine-manager Treloar
returned to Amurika a couple of weeks back. The
departure was quiet and no speeches were made.
Matters underground on the properties are not as they
should be, and though general-manager Bellinger may
have had trouble in getting labor for his mine out
at the dead-end of things, a word or two might also
be said about the management. The Mines Depart-
ment recently pushed the co. into connecting North
Cobar for ventilation. This had been getting worse
and worse, and the worker will only stand up to a
certain amount of heat and bad air underground.
Also there are constant complaints about inability to
obtain tools and conveniences to work with. If Bel-
linger would only inaugurate some kind of a grumble
book, to be used by the workers underground, it
would provide him with some interesting reading, and
might give him a better idea of the difficulties than
the reports he gets from shift bosses, deputations
from A.M.A., etc. Then it might also be easier to
get and keep good men, and the furnaces might, with
less difficulty, be fed up to their full capacity. Ches-
ney plant is running well, but underground things
there are behind. It would be very interesting to
see a statement of the total cost of the Chesnev plant,
and also detailed statements of the treatment costs,
etc. It’s about time a little light was thrown on
to this part of the proposition. A drought is looking
the co. in the face, too, to make things more un-
pleasant.

also of the Norse Power Syndicate, a wealthy inter-

To enable him to cope with the work of the two
cos. he, a while ago, “imported” from Australia

ther of the manager of the Broken Hill South : and
there are one or two Australian foremen on the

borg, in Sweden, where one of the new Norse works
is just getting its finishing touches.

Malcolm Maclaren and Allan Davidson
have been telling, through the Mining and Scientific
1 kess, how tellurides were first discovered at Ival-
goorlie. The scene of the discovery was the Block
40, now included in Oroya Links. The then mana-
ger, Dick Eades, had obtained rich assays from
samples that showed little or no free gold. This
puzzled Eades, and he sent the stuff to some Kal-
goorlie and Coolgardie assayers, who suggested that
the unknown mineral was some form of iron sul-
t,ut; * ts extren| e softness at once exploded
that theory. Later on, some specimens were taken
to Earle Huntley, who had had some experience of
tellurides at Mount Shamrock (Q.), and he sug-
gested that the new mineral was a telluride of gold.
Huntley tooled away fragments of the mineral, and
then made blowpipe tests, which proved the accuracy
ot his suggestion. Confirmatory tests were made by
A. G. Holroyd, and the news of the discovery was
then given to the press. Before this publication,
Huntley, Holroyd and other experimentalists had
discussed the occurrence in all its bearings, and
saw in it the solution of the problem that for three
years had puzzled mining men at Kalgoorlie—the
source of the rich deposits of “mustard” gold and
sponge gold that were so characteristic of the
oxidised zone of the Boulder mines.

More capital has been put up in Adelaide
to give the Chaffinch another chance—enough to
pay for a bore hole; and in view of recent develop-
! n , the no, 'thern workings of the adjoining
Bullfinch Prop., those who have subscribed believe
that something good will be struck at depth. In
that case a larger co. is to be floated to take over
the show. In the light of past experience, how-
ever, boreholes in the West are not to be trusted,
and core assays have more often than not been
delusions. It may not be so in this case, but the
experience is worth remembering.
Bullfinch Prop. (W.A.) has declared its
first div. of Is., and pays out on November 3. Regu-
lar quarterly distributions are expected to follow.
A reliable man in Archie Hay, formerly manager of
the Hainault, has been appointed manager in place
of Fred Morgan, deceased.
Great Boulder (W.A.) has taken an option
on the Big Bell group at Paton’s Find, 20 miles
from Cue. There is a very wide ore channel in the
property, and trial crushings have averaged over the
ounce. The show is in a locality which is alleged
to have gold, silver, mica, wolfram, tin, beryls,
emeralds and goodness knows what in payable quan-
tities, so there is a chance of the Boulder hitting
the pigeon if it misses the crow.
Mountain Queen (W.A.) has decided to
take the Great Victoria on trial. Several concerns
in search of mines, including the Great Boulder,
have tested the Victoria, but so far no one has been
game enough to make a deal. One reason has been
scarcity of water for crushing; but should the Moun-
tain Queen acquire the property it would probably
convey the ore to its own plant, six miles away, for
treatment. The low average of the stone is, however,
a disability.

Perth Full Court ruled the other day that
in cases where a mine manager is prosecuted for
employing a foreigner who cannot speak English, the
said foreigner must be produced in court, to prove
his inability to do so. This, however, is more easily
said than done. Unintelligible foreigners have a
knack of disappearing when a mine boss is sum-
moned for having them about the mine, and they are
hard to trace. Some unfriendly persons say that
they are spirited away to another field to work in
another mine under another name, but this paper
cannot say for certain whether this is true or
not.

Ominous extract from manager’s annual
report on the Kalgurli (W.A.), with a more ominous
one still from a SDecial report bv Dr. Malcolm
Maclaren: —“Our deepest workings have added no-
thing to reserves, but the amount of ore developed in
the levels and stopes above places us in much the
same position as at the close of last year—namely,
250,000 tons in sight. No claim to strict accuracy
in regard to this estimate is made. As to grade,
the decline of Bd. per ton this year may be attri-
buted to a more general adoption of contract work
in stoping. Under this system more waste rock is
being broken. There is little doubt that the two
years’ life ahead of the mine which the reserves in-
dicate will be prolonged, but to what extent and on
what scale of profit it would be idle to predict.”
Dr. Maclaren says:—“The Kalgurli lodes pass finally
out of the favorable quartz dolerite at between 1750 ft.
and 1850 ft. It is by no means the only Kalgoorlie
mine that has encountered such conditions. Five
other important ones have suffered in the same way,
together with several smaller shows. The experiences
of all these have been identical; namely, that beyond
a short distance —generally less than 100 ft. beneath
the favorable quartz dolerite —the lode channels
fail to carry ore. In gaining this experience not less
than £345,000 and probably £400,000 has been ex-
pended in driving, crosscutting and sinking in the
unfavorable calc-schist. One co., vainly hoping
against hope, has during the past three years spent
£48,000 in this pursuit, reaching a depth of 500 ft.
beneath the contact, but recovered practically no
payable ore. In this instance the lode was far
stronger and better defined than those in the Kalgurli.
The only possibility at greater depth for the Kalgurli
therefore is that the vertical ore channels may in-
tersect favorable rock on further sinking, but I don’t
think there is any hope in that direction. lam of
opinion, however,' that a little further exploration
may be made, preferably by diamond drilling, be-
neath the 1850 ft. level, not that I have any hope of
profitable ore being obtained beneath that level, but
rather to make assurance doubly sure. Final''', if we
accept (as indeed I think we must) the exploration
on the lower levels (1750 ft. and 1850 ft.) as being
fairlv comprehensive, and if we are to profit at all
by the huge and otherwise profitless expenditure in
the calc-schist, there is one inevitable conclusion —-
namely, that it is unsound mining business to sink
deeper in the njine in search of ore bodies that both
the indications present and a wide experience of
similar conditions combine in asserting to be non-
existent.” Of course this isn’t news. The Bulletin
said two years ago that the Kalgurli had touched
bottom —in other words, that unfavorable country
had come in from the east and cut its main ore
bodies clean off. k ,
Ivanhoe’s reserves go on dwindling. The
general manager’s latest estimate of ore in sight is
1.045,500 tons, of a gross value of £2,056,150,
against 1,080,850 tons, containing £2,196,897, which
he reckoned was visible six months ago. The con-
sulting engineers (8., M and Co.) estimate the quan-
tity at 1,059,418 tons, of a gross value of
£2 105,594, which is 30,177 tons and £106,296 less
than they estimated was visible half a year ago.
Allowing 30s. a ton to cover all exes, and losses in
residues, the latest estimates give a profit in sight of
48/9 and 51/8 respectively. # ,
Hope, Beaufort (Vic.), had its machinery
burnt the other day. Then some criminal or fool set
alight to the puddlers—there isn’t much doubt that
it was a deliberate attempt to burn things down.
The pitv of it is that it happened at a time when a
strike was on over the non-unionist eruption. No sane
worker tolerates the destruction of his bread-winning
appliances. Therefore while some young ass or a
brainless unionist may have been tempted to burn
and destroy, The Bulletin declines to accept the
view that this was a deliberately planned and coldly
instigated act of unionist incendiarism.

Burnt Creek, Bet Bet (Vic.), after hav-
ing carried on almost as long as the oldest inhabi-
tant can remember, is to shut down. Gold worth
about £lBO,OOO has been drawn from it, but divi-
dends have been only about £BOOO. Thus the work
has been for the benefit of' anybody and everybody
except the shareholders. The Board, of course,
preaches that the miner has been fed. True, but he
also has had to render unto the paymaster full ser-
vice for his wage, earned in wet ground and often
in bad air. That the Burnt Creek has to close does
not arise from lack of efficiency or the interference
of the Miners’ Association, but because the gutter was
cementy and the gold in the wash below the pay
point. Anyway, what with the heap of slime and
the plant and the other etceteras, a liquidation divi-
dend of about 4s. a share ought to be available dur-
ing the next month. Still it is a pity to see a mine
like the Burnt Creek curl up ; for one thing, another
300 miners will come into the labor market just when
there isn’t much demand for them.
* * * * *
Jumbunna Coal (Vic.) has the jumps
again. These recur just as often as one Boyd, M.P.,
and Murray, ex-Railway Commissioner, blow the big
horn. Jumbunna does a coal trade of about £40,000
a year, but with Wonthaggi State mine cutting into
the State requirements of big and small coal, the co.
fails to heap up profits while eating up its mineral
reserves. This doesn’t suit the directors, who used
to enjoy a big slice of the railway contracts and the
pickings of the small-coal trade of Melbourne. Now
that the State mine furnishes competition, the Gipps-
land private mines have to provide their own back-
bone, or burst. Boyd doesn’t, of course, say this.
What he does say (with his left eyelid on the droop)
is conveyed by the following paragraph: “But in the
face of all these difficulties we look forward with
hope that within the next 12 months we shall have
opened up an area of good, profitable coal, and that
the co. will again be earning regular dividends. The
demand for coal is greater than the supply.” That
being so, one wonders why J. A. Boyd, M.P., flared
up so at the half-yearly meeting. Of course, it is
worrying to find the State coal mine living down
criticism; but if the demand for the co.’s coal is
greater than the supply, and if the directors “expect
prices of coal to harden in the near future,” why
pipe so plaintively ?
There isn’t much in the little Mining
Companies Bill which Attorney-General Brown has
laid before the Leg. Council of Victoria, but that
little makes some Fatmen’s adipose tissue very quiv-
ery. It isn’t the proposed form of the balance-sheet
that hurts the big man, for he will be able to
escape a lot of detail if the model isn’t recast. What
he will squirm over will be the penalties to which
directors will be subjected unless they do the straight
thing a little straighter than in the past. The first
essential is the publication of a prospectus whenever
anyone attempts to form a mining co. Why not the
same over any co. that proposes to make profits out
of mine patents or products ? There have been in-
stances where such a prospectus was, and still is,
badly wanted. Other provisions are designed (1) to
make directors and promoters of cos. liable to pay
compensation for untrue or reckless statements in
prospectuses, (2) to do the same with the expert who
seeks to diddle people by making wilfully misleading
statements in prospectus reports, (3) to throw open
books of account, balance-sheets and half-yearly state-
ments to shareholders and creditors, (4) to compel
auditors to draw attention to any irregularities that
may come under their notice, (5) to make mine man-
agers send in declarations with their progress reports,
and (6) to throw open to inspection all reports not
relating to matters of advice and policy. There is a
lot more in the Bill, but these are the essentials, and
they have the unadulterated approval of every decent
mining man and every straight market jobber. When
chairmen of directors have ’phones straight into big
brokers’ offices, it’s time that the meshes of the law
were tightened. The little game whereby the director
scoffs up commissions for deals between his co. and
others ought to be spoiled—he should be
made to show his grains. Ditto also the
officials who get special gratuities and bon-
uses, as this is the fatman’s way of using company’s
money to keep sweet with useful men on the staff.
The Bulletin hasn’t much belief that the Bill will
pass; but if it doesn’t, something approaching a
model for future reform has at least been provided.

The Tyrconnel, Hodgkinson (N.Q.), re-
ports a good development; a 3ft. reef —worth 20z., it
is said —has been met in the crosscut, and there is
another section of stone behind it of lower value.
Water proved troublesome, so this crosscut was run
in at a shallower level than was originally intended.
The Tyrconnel was famous in the ’7o’s, when it gave
a fortune to a co-operative party.

Many Peaks (Q.) has been flourishing on
a royalty of 2s. 6d. per ton received from Mount
Morgan, which for 12 months to May 31 took 99,051
tons of pyritic fluxing ore carrying a trifle over 1
p.c. copper. But for the last 12 weeks the quantity
smelted at Morgan has been only 9477 tons (July
3929 tons, August 2970 tons, September 2578 tons).
Many Peaks in 12 months to June 30 paid 2s. sd.
per share ( £9864) in dividends, but it can’t do that
during the current year unless it finds some other
source of revenue, which at present seems unlikely.
The great hopes concerning the deposits
of kerosene shale near the Narrows (Central Queens-
land) seem to have been given a knockout. After
the usual paper puff had subsided, a geologist dropped
in; and now the country correspondent thereabouts
reports that “practically nothing is being done.”
When the country correspondent says nothing is
happening in his little kingdom, it is safe to bet that
the little kingdom is very dead indeed.
The reconstruction of the Oaks Amalga-
mated (N.Q.) has been successfully carried out, and
the Oaks (No Liability) has been formed. The capi-
tal of the new co. is £25,000, in 20s. shares, of
which 10,000 are contributing, issued as paid up to
14s. per share upon payment of 4s. per share applica-
tion and allotment. The applicants for these
contribs. receive 10,000 fully paids of 20s. each _in
proportion of one paid for every one contributing
share applied for. The remaining 5000 are held in
reserve. The new co. proposes installing a com-
pletely new crushing plant, for which manager Laby
says there is enough profitable feed in sight to last
two yea rs.
Mount Lyell (Tas.) is so far back
towards its old form that it is once more able to
furnace 1000 tons of crude ore per day. From its
last 28,721 tons (in 28 days) the converter return was:
copper 589 tons, silver 41,3430 z., and gold 7420 z.
The average is a shade over 2 p.c. copper, with from
ss. to 6s. worth of precious metals.
“Silas Snell”: A flicker drama that has
been jigging in all parts of Australia lately comes
from America, although it is highly probable, the
idea of it germinated in Australia. The story is of
a comic poultry farmer in the States, with a few
acres of poor land, a tumbled shack, and a. herd of
impoverished geese, who contrives to sell his miser-
able outfit for £lO,OOO to a speculative millionaire
bv simply salting his geese. I don’t mean to say he
pickled the feathered bipeds in ordinary brine; no-
thing so common. He stuffed some coarse gold
samples into the crops of his geese, and sold the
birds to the millionaire for culinary purposes. When
a few specimens turned up in successive geese, the
millionaire concluded the land they browsed on was
littered with the metal, and got out after those
acres with his clothes full of 50dol. bills. I fancy
the first rush that ever arose out of the goose with
the gold in his gullet happened in the vicinity of
Mount Moliagul (Vic.), close upon 40 years ago.
A Dunolly poulterer struck a few specks in the crop,
panned his goose off, and realised two ’weights. He
wasted no time, and Goose Creek rush resulted. Many
times since the domestic birds of the corner State
have picked up a few grains, and directed attention
to valuable surfacing. 1 remember an instance of
my boyhood at Waddy. “Tinker” Smith found a
very decent prospect in the crop of his Christmas
goose. He went round and cadged crops of other
Christmas geese sold by him, and in three instances
got the color. There was no shallow alluvial at
Waddy, but “Tinker” washed prospects from all over
the shop where the geese ran, and got nothing. He
was nonplussed till he remembered that his geese had
recently been in pound. The pound embraced the
Pioneer lease. But the Pioneer was a thing of the
past, its tips were removed, and little sign of the
old mine remained. After assiduous fossicking, he
struck his patch. Where the big office of the Pioneer
had stood, he scraped £7OO worth of fine gold off
about 64 sq. yards of surfacing. This represented
dust that had been lost during the long years in
which the rich returns of the Pioneer were handled
in that office, and had been discovered by a goose
where nobody but a goose would have dreamed of
looking for gold.

LETTERS
Sydney, October 13, 1913.
My Dear Arini, —
Austral-Britannia doesn’t always rule the
waves. On the day of the “At Home” on
the Australia a stiff north-easter whipped up
a jerky sea that made the pontoon alongside
the gangway heave like a sea-sick turtle.
FT-om this pontoon a tricky set of steps stag-
gered up the side of our flagship. Two irre-
sponsible ropes, very far apart, waved like
straws as despairing woman flung herself
forward on tlieir uncertain support. The
steps fell down from the edges at an angle
of 45 degrees. Guests arrived at the top of
this perilous ascent with their coat-tails or
their skirts (as the case might be) blowing
round the scenery, and their hearts thumping
in their throats. Flaving fallen upon the
hand of something in uniform that was wait-
ing to welcome them, they stood on the firm
deck with a passionate desire not to climb
any more sea staircases. Warned by the
ascent, cautious soles scrambled down the
gangway in good time, and watched their
friends and foes drop off the lower steps and
arrive with a bang on the pontoon.
Archbishop Wright, very neat and nimble
in the region of his gaiters, came down
swiftly. Mrs. Archbishop, with a worried
expression about her ankles, tottered in mid-
air, clutching at her skirts. His Legs made
a gallant attempt at rescue, but the lady
waved him off and bumped the landing stage
alone. John Lane-Mullins formed himself
into a salvage party of one, and, being of a
lean and active build, dashed up the steps
to hand down the faint-hearted. Mrs. C. E.
Waters, very fair and plump, made a joyous
descent in a Mandalay-blue silk coat over a
tussore frock. Mrs. George Earp was clad in
something surprising in blue and crimson.
Mrs. Luscombe was a vision in cream dra-
peries, tied about the waist with floral silk.
Mrs. W. A. Holman, dressed in a shot-silk
gown that flashed in the sun, gripped the
hand of her only chick. Portia. This Titian-
haired infant was frocked in the latest style,
and her small bonnet must have caused con-
vulsions of envy in the breasts of less decor-
ative babes. Mrs. W. Macleod and brother
Gerald O’Brien and the Henniker Heatons
were of the party. Mr. Justice Sly handed
Mrs. Justice safely on board the wherry’.
Mrs. Allen Taylor made a strenuous ascent
just ahead of Hugh Ward’s comely dame,
who, on the journey, gave herself up for lost
at least 16 times. Yet nobody had to be
fished out of the harbor. But the man who
said in his haste that he had never seen so
many legs in his life as he did at Randwick
on Saturday was not present at our Flag-
shirt’s great ankle display.
Chief Justice Cullen and his gentle dame
gave a garden party in excelsis to Admiral
Patey and his sea-lions. Few gardens near
Sydney can compare with the Cullens’ acre-
age of native bush. The lovely tangle of
primeval forest has been just sufficiently
touched up by a landscape gardener to keep
its natural profusion in place. Winding
paths fall down into gullies where fern and
flower grow wild. On the upper terrace,
where are trim lawns and the tame blos-
soms of suburbia, the Cullen pair welcomed
the old lions and the young cubs to Tregoyd.
The Patey profile, under a cocked hat, was
turned towards the great splash of blue
water that laps North Head; thus
anchored beside his hosts he said
how-d’you-do to the party. Parsons
galore and a solid helping of the law
gave a serious background to the frocking.
This was highly respectable, not to say dull
—the X-ray skirts and gartered knees that
pranced round the lawn at Randwick have
given us a taste for comic-opera in daylight.
Governor Strickland and his fair-haired
eldest treasure, Miss Mary, were more or
less attended by A.D.C. Talbot, who wore
an aggrieved exrtression and immaculate
frocking. Mrs. Ethel Turner Curlewis, a
determined gardener in her off-the-pen
moments, went off with hubby to ex-
plore the secret fastnesses of the
Cullens’ bush. The Spencer Brunton
lady sailed across the gravel path in
the sartorial event of the afternoon. This
was a stupendous Paris creation of sand-
colored satin, top-dressed with a floral silk
tunic of so many complications that no lay
mind could presume to say where it hooked
and eyed. Ex-Flag-FJeutenant Seton
escorted his best girl, Miss Joan Deck, of
the willow-wand figure and grey velvet eyes,
to the tea-cups. Squatter Kenneth Mackay,
of Wallendbeen, looked in. A learned sec-
tion from Sydney Uni. helped to give a tone
ro the occasional frivolity of diaphanous
frocks. One of the nicest-looking young
persons present, Miss Joyce Allen, was de-
murely clad in a white lingerie frock that
might have walked out with an archbishop.
At the Fleet Ball at State Government
House Governor Strickland and his lady,
with our own sea-dog Patey at their side,
gave the welcoming hand to a numerous
throng. General Finn and A.D.C. Talbot sped
the arriving guests to the sub-regal gloves.
Rose-tinted shades in the reception room
were most helpful to the dead-white paste
with which Society girls are smearing their
mask-like countenances. Mrs. Baronet
Cooper, a fine, broad-shouldered specimen
of Australian womanhood, glittered with
diamonds in the crush. Selections from
the large Knox family, the Henniker Heaton
maiden in dove grey plumage, the C. G.
Wade pair, a generous helping of Cabinet
Ministers and their female belongings, and
a terrific concourse ot dancers who had
scarcely room for the soles of their feet,
twirled round the congested ball-room. Mrs.
Trefl4 shepherded a sprightly flock of nice
looking dancers. Miss McCrone, a pretty
Temora girl, robed in blush-pink, and a
youthful Miss Barlow, were included in the
group. The Admirable King-Hall took one
of his last bird’s-eye views of Sydney
Society’s bare necks at this party.
A ready-reckoner declared that he
counted 40 superfluous girls, owing to a
shortage of the male dancer. The male who
is prepared only to lean up against a wall
till supper-time was plentiful, while wall-
flowers bloomed profusely on the verandahs.
The Citizens’ Reception to Admiral
Patey and his officers took the form of a
gigantic evening crush in the Town Hall.
At 8.30 p.m. on October 9 the front steps of
that useful building were packed with
slowly-moving bodies, advancing at the rate
of one inch per minute. Town Clerk Nes-
bitt and his next-in-command, the indispens-
able Layton, hovered round the Mayor; and
some of the naval frills, extra-special, were
dared to leave the spot till they had been
shaken by the 2000th hand. On the plat-
form a Union Jack buried something very
large and suggestive of the shield and bell
for presentation to the cruiser Sydney.
This presentation was to have been the
star turn of the evening. The crowd
moved forward to see the Gaud Mayor,
clothed in great majesty, hand over to
Skipper Glossop the solid symbols of our
goodwill. But the company heard with a
shock that the shield and bell were not
ready, after which it glared at two framed
representations of the gifts.
Tall women must have blessed their height
at this crush. Mrs. George Fuller and
her daughter Gladys were among the few
thus able to inspect the scenery; Mrs.
Neville Mayman was a head and a white
tulle bandeau over the multitude of short
and stout. Mrs. Joe Cook ambled through
the throng. The Pritchard Bassetts trod
warily, especially when the fierce rush for
refreshments set in. Mrs. E. W. O’Sullivan
and daughter Eva found breathing space
near the dais, sacred to anything with a
long tail to its name. The glimmer of
green and gold lights, and the swinging
canopy of feathery smilax overhead, turned
the Town Hall into a place of beauty.
But the presentation which was not a pre-
sentation gave a chill to the middle of the
entertainment.
At the State schools’ day-out on the
Cricket Ground the kiddies made a
map of Australia with a coastline
about 10 youngsters deep; and Mrs.
Admiral Creswell gave the Australia presen-
tation flag a jerk and sent it up the flag-
pole. While it flirted with the breeze, the
youngsters had time to chortle with pride
over the fact that their pennies had bought
this bunting, with some self-denial in the
matter of bulls’-eyes and marbles. Peter
Board, FJnder-Sec. for Education, handed
over the handsome rag to Lieut.
Enman, of the Australia. The squad
of attendant bluejackets was small,
but the wild enthusiasm of the native-
born was as big as if an armada was
being greeted. Governor Strickland was
officially shadowed by Admiral Creswell,
with Defence Minister Millen lurking in
their wake. Lady Edeline drove on to the
ground and had a young daughter under her
wing.
Saturday, the final flutter at the Spring
Meeting, was a gorgeous day for frocks.
W oman strode about the lawn in gossamer
muslins with cob-web lingerie, obviously a
two-legged creature. Garters with paste
buckles glittered over one knee of the occa-
sional lady in the last gasp of bizarre fashion.
Silk tights, or the frilly garments that are
usually only exhibited on back-yard clothes-
lines when washing-day comes round, were
displayed under silky transparencies that
were supposed to cover the forms of the most
daring. Low-necked corsages are bringing
their own Nemesis. Tanned and freckled
collar-bones and muddy-brown necks are the
net result of the present scheme of undress.
Hats, which perched like thimbles on the
coiffures of the Elect, have grown an inch or
two larger than they were at the Autumn
Meeting. The spiky wheat-ear trimming,
which is a cheap substitute for the exquisite
flowers of the milliners’ rose-beds, is not
alluring. The fashionable girl is necessarily
angular to fit her 1913 clothes, and she is
too much like a wheat-ear herself to stand
more spikes on her head.
The white hand-made lingerie gowns were
amongst the most attractive signs of the joy
of life at Saturday’s meet. The tall Brennan
sisters, Florence and Ad&le, were clad in
these frothy garments, with Heaven knows
how many yards of hand-sewn lace worked
into the ground plan. Mrs. Kenna was
clothed like a lily, or like a lily would be if
it could order a frock of white sponge-cloth
and a large leghorn hat. The incident of
motoring into a tram, or being tram-squeezed
in a motor, on the way to Randwick, gave
Mrs. Kenna a rather startled expression,
which didn’t wear off till teatime. Dorothy
King kindly showed us a sample of Noo Yark
style, in a plaid-green silk blouse-tunic over
a dark skirt, and a remarkable plumed toque.
Lizard-skin shoes finished this tricky toilet.
Solicitor Norris tore himself away from
the male members’ stand which tolerates (at
high prices) but does not encourage the
female sex in its sacred enclosure. Fie paced
the lawn for five minutes with pretty sister
Etta, whose champagne suit and cerise hat
was the thing for a blue-eyed girl, then slip-
ped away to the eyrie where Woman is
frankly regarded as a nuisance. * From its
Olympian heights, strewn with cigar-ends
and other male bric-h-brac, a superb view of
the Horse can be enjoyed, unbroken by a
tulle bow. Mrs. Tom Rolin put her hand-
some head into one of the new squashed satin
toques. An indeterminate blue gown that
went with this millinery was cloaked in
black, with a dashing flick of rose-color on
its collar. Sheila Chisholm, in a duck-egg
green coatee and a white skirt, looked rather
larger round the waist than a plump young
clothes-prop. Mrs. Bertie Rouse, one of the
most decorative young matrons from the
sheepwalks of Mudgee, put her attractive
countenance under a feathered grev hat that
curled all over in ostrich fluff. The Shep-
heard Laidley damsel tossed her haughty nose
under a small-brimmed headgear, and swished
a white satin race-coat round her exclusive
angles. Mrs. Tom Hughes and Mrs. Ernest
Wilshire were neck and neck as wearers of
the two best-looking black and white gowns.
The A.J.C. Committee is alleged to have
moved tons of obstacles to try to get the
roof ready for the Randwick grand-stand
crowd. Some far-off cause, a strike in Eng-
land, or the small-pox, or the Balkan row,
prevented the arrival of the iron girders in
time. Hence the wails of the roofless.
Wagner’s “Mastersingers of Nuremberg”
interrupted Society’s evening meal on Satur-
day. A stern managerial foreword threat-
ened to leave latecomers on the doormat of
Her Majesty’s Theatre if they failed to be
seated at 7 p.m. In spite of this warning, a
belated dinner party or two and a few
casuals straggled in after that witching hour.
They had to stand in gloomy silence, as part
of the background, till the curtain rolled
down on Act 1. For this mercy all the early
arrivals whose feet they would otherwise
have stamped over had much cause for thank-
fulness.
Mrs. Hugh Ward had the Holmans as her
guests in the manager’s box. Dr. Stewart
McKay was in the opposite box, with two
ornamental young women shepherded by a
discreet dame. Prof. MacCallum and his
tall lady climbed into the front row of the
d.c. Mrs. Mac is a German, and too pro-
foundly musical to be submerged in a stall
during an evening-out (it’s really two-thirds
of a night-out) with Wagner. The Arthur
Allens also forsook the fashionable burying-
ground in the mid-stalls, and camped in the
centre of the d.c. This usually-snubbed area
gathered up most of the professional musi-
cians who hadn’t clambered into the gallery.
Here conductor Joseph Bradley, of the Phil.,
drank in the singing tones of the orchestra
fiddles. Arundel Orchard, of the Liedertafel,
wore. an ecstatic expression in the same
vicinity. Miss Mary Fairfax and her
mamma —the latter just better after a severe
bout with vaccination in the third degree—
were also perched aloft. In the front row
sat a small child in large pink hair-bows and
spectacles. She gradually sank down into a
limp heap of white lingerie as the night
wore on and minstrel Walther showed no
signs of abating his melodious bellow for
love of Eva, the goldsmith’s yellow-wigged
daughter.
In the stalls, the tops of a few well-known
heads were just visible in the sixteenth-cen-
tury twilight. The musical McQuades
flanked the crescendo whiskers of the amaz-
ing Teuton conductor Eckhold, whose mem-
ory for Wagner is as large as the hold of a
cargo steamer. Soldier Finn and the ladies
of his household were further back, but
within long-distance range of the stout, pink
legs of one of the Nuremberg apprentices.
Jeanne Brola, as Eva, meandered through
“The Mastersingers” with coquettish smiles,
long yellow plaits and some pleasing top
notes. She was shadowed by a faithful
attendant (Magdalene) in flower-pot millin-
ery and voluminous drapery. Robert Parker
towered over the rest of the company as the
shoemaker poet. Hans Sachs. Tenor Spencer
Thomas, the Walther of Saturday night’s
performance, was a tow-headed dandy, his
generous waist-line decorated with a six-
teenth century sash like a slice cut from a
red and black draught-board. He warbled
his love for Eva with a lung power that made
the chequered support strain at its moorings,
and caused the legs of his long buff boots
to sag with emotion. “The Mastersingers” is
chiefly a male operatic show, though some of
the apprentices who act as chorus were of
the female persuasion. The large, pink
understandings, already alluded to, were of
this sex, and almost as impressive as the
calves that Ivy Schilling fli nes ahm . .

John McCormack has farewelled this town
m a burst of enthusiasm that could do nothin*
less than bang chair-legs on the Town HaU
floor. This form of applause is more stimi
lating to the singer than to the city’s fund
ture. The choir seats worked themselves inm
an encore frenzy at Friday and Saturday
nights’ concerts, and laid hands on John him
self, while portion of the audience, under the
galleries, seized anything movable and hit it
hard on the flooring timber. When
McCormack got into his last group of
songs a male occupant of a reserved
chair was so charmed with “Oft in the Chilly
Night” that he joined in and hummed like
a top. May Huxley on Friday was gowned
in greenish-yellow plumage—the color of pale
limejuiee seen through a glass bottle. It
matched the girl’s pretty canary-like twitter
and the sleek gold of her shining hair.
Bishop Trower, who hails from Broome
(W.A.), has been staying at the Strick-
lands’ vice-regal cot. Broome is in the
semi-tropic North-West, where “black” Aus-
tralians are on the lookout for signs of
enfeebled health among the whites; but they
don’t get much encouragement from the
appearance of Bishop Trower. He was the
finest-looking specimen of robust manhood in
gaiters at the Cullens’ garden party; and
the saucy little black satin bows on his silk
hat were much admired by ladies who have
a taste for ecclesiastic millinery.
Red frocks in flimsy summer materials are
first favorites with sparkling brunettes. Miss
Winifred Ward, a young daughter of the
Daily Telegraph’s editor, was clothed in
a specially cute combination of red flicked
with black at a recent Fleeting show. The
black tail was the last gasp of fashion: it
was in the form of a sash-end that suddenly
escaped out of a small slash at the waist and
fell in a knotted end down a straight-back
breadth.
Flowers, in tight little early-Victorian
posies, and flimsy tulle bows, with the general
appearance of belonging to multi-winged but-
terflies, ran riot in some of the race hats.
Ostrich feathers in small colonies waved
above the heads of our haughtiest damsels.
This manner of adornment rages with un-
abated fury (the fury occurs when the bills
come home to Papa), and strikes overseas
visitors in a heap. Artist Ethel Phillips Fox
says she has never seen so many feathers a(
the other end of the earth at any one gather-
ing as danced in the breeze at the Cullens’
garden party.
The squatting Bucklands, of Pine
Ridge, are in town for the October
uproar of horse and fleet. The good-
looking Doris is going to act as brides-
maiden to Doris Hermann —a pretty little
dark-browed girl of the Rebecca type, a sister
of the well-known Mrs. Bertie Sheldon, who
is gadding on the other side. Miss Her-
mann’s young man is one of the numerous
Ryries. The engagement is almost brand-
new, but details of the orange-blossoming are
already oozing through in kimono confi-
dences.
Now that ex-Flag-Lieut. Seton retires from
the limelight to the instructional staff
of the Tingira, Society will mark the new
man, Poe. for its own. He flag-lieutenants
on our H.M.A.S. Australia, and was here
before, in his middy days. A large, well-
set-up sailor, with a sharply-defined manner,
he has a strong belief in the seaworthy
qualities of Australian tars.
Captain Glossop, of the H.M.A.S. Sydney,
made the speech at the Citizens’ Reception
party in the Town Flail. His hearty grati-
tude for favors to come—the bell and shield
which are to go to the Sydney being still in
the hands of craftsmen —was jerked out in a
lively fashion, with an effervescing finish.
Skipper Glossop is one of the lean, active
sailor-men, who look as if they could almost
blow through a chink in an argument with-
out losing a hair. His joyous thanks for
the bell(e) of Sydney, since the country
gave not only its sons but its daughters to
the navy, was a climax much appreciated.
Already Society campaigners are inquiring
whether the joyous Glossop is “settled” in
life.
Among the crowd that watched the lusty
babv-Fleet come home was Mr. Henry
Richards, of Chatswood, who belongs
to the family of that Captain Richards who
carried to London headquarters the dis-
natches reporting Nelson’s victory at
Trafalgar.
Barrister-Journalist J. D. Fitzgerald has
stepped ashore again after a scamper
through U.S. and Europe.
Rose Day, on October 18, is going to tear
cash from the general public from dusty morn
till thirsty eve. Fifty-six charities, with
hungry wolves gnawing at their vitals, are
waiting for the results. The Strickland lady
is going to drive round town and inquire into
the financial statement about noon.
Yours affectionately,
YANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, October 13, 1913.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The weather played a wretched trick on
the spring fashions that went out to the
Caulfield Guineas on Saturday. It was
blazing hot when they fluttered out; but a
cold change whistled up, and dresses that
were mostly chiffon were no protection
against it. Worried chauffeurs laden with
fur wraps hunted for their she-bosses on the
crowded stand, while the unmotored looked
on enviously and wondered if they would
escape pneumonia. Most of the Jews were
warmly at home because it was the Day of
Atonement. The chosen race seems always
to score, somehow. The G.-G. pair let the
races slide and took the brother and sister-
in-law down to Queenscliff to visit the chil-
dren. Miss Knatchbull-Hugessen (I’m get-
ting tired of that post-impressionist
name!) had a whole corps of Gentle-
men Helps with her. She floated in lilac
plumes and lilac silk, with violet shoes,
until the sun disappeared, when she muffled
herself hastily in a heavy fur coat. Lieut.-
Gov. John Madden sat in the vice-regal box
with his long white hair blowing under his
silk hat. His dame wore a crown of up-
standing black tulle and a voluminous
wrap. After responding to the Anthem-
burst, they proceeded, attended by ilelp
Crespin, to the old-fashioned green and gold
chariot, which is dragged by a pair of fat
chestnuts and steered by a fat coachman,
supported by a thin footman —the denizens
of the Madden box-seat since the beginning
of history.
There was an air of furtive and unseemly
gaiety about some of last week’s opera-
haunters. The grand finale was at hand —-
the long, listening job was ending. On
Wednesday “The Flying Dutchman” stirred
the house, and some hilarious squattocrats
were almost turned out for their flow of holi-
day spirits. Brain culturists who still
retained some vestiges of their musical pose,
turned in their seats and hissed like law-
abiding snakes over their too-plump or too-
scraggy shoulders. (The woman with the
just-right shoulders always smiles.) In
most cases the merriment abated before the
hovering usher arrived on the scene like an
apologetic black ghost. The Government
House people, just returned from the Fleet
celebration in Sydney, did not put in an
official appearance; but the Barttelot dame
brought the Hon. Harold Pearson as escort,
and the two laughed and chatted in ordinary,
paid-for seats. She wore a beautiful fur
coat and a wreath of diamond leaves. Mrs.
Quinlan, in white satin and diamonds, occu-
pied a whole box. Bernard Hall lurked
behind the curtain in a stage box, and his
wife just showed an artistic blue snood and
a glimpse of brown hair. Mrs. Busst, clad
in petunia, pouted: “I don’t know why I
came —I’ve been every night recently to
opera in Germany!” There, now! Mrs.
Geoff. Syme was back in her old seat. She
looked well, and showed no traces of her
recent illness.
The only Quinlan production of “Tristan
and Isolde” was most effective. The music
is sugary for Wagner; it must have a fat-
tening effect, because the principals who sing
it have got record waist-measurements. The
opera, being distinctly sung in English, re-
vealed to Mrs. Grundy that Isolde was
nothing less than a hussy. On that ground,
some moral folk sternly refused to admire
the leopard-spotted bridal train, or the wed-
ding head-dress that looked like a milk-shake
machine. Parker, as Kurvenal, the servant
of King Mark, gets all the fat, so far as the
dressing is concerned. He wears his skins
with an air, and manages a great silver-wolf
cloak with feminine skill. Just here I want
to edge in a word or so against the usual
stage couch. It is never the luxurious nest
of cushions and rugs that it should be; con-
sequently, the pronounced curves of the
massive prima donna are cruelly revealed,
and if she wears large boots, they look like
snow-shoes.
The last night of the opera drew a thor-
oughly musical audience. Instead of the
usual mixed programme, which attracts the
semi-musical populace like a circus, one
whole opera was staged—the intensely
modern “Louise.” First-nighters were not
officially on duty; but the really musical
ones came along and sat in any old seats
they could get. Their excitement when they
discovered some former neighbor in a new
location was touching to witness. There
was a great rally at sunper time in the
lounge, and the cherry-ribboned girls were
kept busy. Apparently, no one had been
so unfashionable as to dine in time for a
seven o’clock opera; or perhaps they just
pretended they hadn’t, in order to excuse
their appetites.
What with aides and visitors, the G.-G.
house party has grown to such proportions
that it requires two theatre boxes to hold it
when there is anything special to see. The
tribe spread itself comfortably in two
pens for “Louise.” The Denman lady was
late. She had been visiting her youngsters,
who are down with something or other at
Queenscliff. Her Ex. had to fit a motor trip
and a fumigating ceremony between an after-
noon tea-party and the opera. The G.-G.,
heavily decorated, arrived to time, in charge
of a batch of ladies, including Miss Knatch-
bull-Ilugessen, the Barttelot dame and Mrs.
Guise. A cloud of Helps trotted dutifully
behind. Amongst them was the new man,
Captain Pollok. His most noticeable fea-
tures are very round, black eyes,
Audrey Chirnside hovered in the back-
ground during the interval. She wore
wreaths of roses round her transparent chif-
fon cloak—a Honolulu belle effect. The
beauties of a prominent brewery family were
boxed at the far side. At last curtain-fall,
some enthusiasts stood up and clamored for
Quinlan, while the homing ushers hurriedly
covered the vacated plush seats with dingy
canvas. But Quinlan was far on his way
to Sydney and echo and a blank curtain-
face answered the uproar, while the wise
people were tumbling downstairs and fighting
their way into trams.
The Q ua mby is the club of the young
matrons, and the Denman lady is the star
mem ber. Last Thursday she was welcomed
back with fl owerß chatter and tea, and her
c j ubmat es were so glad to see her that they
tore her c i o thes, not quite off her back, but
near i y so . When the victim walked into the
up .g o i ng lift, she was a picture of coolness
anc j self-possession in turquoise crepe, with
a girlish fichu of white net round her shoul-
(iers. When the scrum was over, two
devoted Helps assisted a flustered, tattered
visitor from the premises, and deposited her
tenderly in a purple motor. Mrs. Hennessy
signified her husband’s return to power and
the dust problem with a red dres*. clamped
securely to her form with gun-metal fixings,
Airs. Leslie Stuart broke away with her
lovely brocaded vest intact; but a coil of
golden hair over one eye showed that she had
h, a( l a , struggle. Mrs. Geoff. Syme got
through safely m a tailored black chiffon.
She sheltered under a wide, cherry-colored
hat, with a rose budded on it. Mrs- Miller
wore her ostrich feathers round her neck,
I orrest dame got herself into a cosy
corner and helped several other dowagers
to a roost of refuge. Mrs. Wallach and
Mrs. Dr. Gardiner bravely wore twin crea-
tions straight from Pans—lovely blue things
with white neck ruffles. Mrs. I rell cam-
paigned in black. Mrs. Howard Lonnell
remarked cuttingly from underneath a smart
a t that it was worse than a charity com-
nuttee meeting. (A hen I tell you that her
dress was of the sort that silences all cnti-
cism. will see at once how crushing it
must have been.) Mrs. Horden, secretary
a hundred chanties, hioked indignantly
over a tussore shoulder. But what was one
tussore shoulder against such fearful odds?
On Wednesday, October 8, Professor
Peterson’s flapper-daughter was wedded
amidst great social excitement to Captain
Harold Mackworth, of the Royal Engineers,
It was the romance of a couple of months,
The Captain, who was reckoned a great
catch, came to Australia just about the
time the Peterson girl was putting up the
hair that used to dangle prettily in two long
Marguerite plaits. It is said that several
college boys went white and resolved to
forswear women and go out into the wilder-
ness when news of the engagement reached
them. The wedding was at Scots’ Church,
where the dreamy, grey-haired musical pro-
fessor led his white-clad girl up the aisle
to a gaudily-uniformed bridegroom, who
was supported by Private Secretary Wilber-
force, of the G.-G. staff, and Frank Peter-
son. Gentleman Help Barttelot’s twin boys
acted as pages (they are really only para-
graphs) and supported the bridal train,
Beryl Fanning and Concie Hamilton, two
cheery flappers, bridesmaided excitedly in
pink, with pink water-lilies on their frocks
and hats. The Peterson couple, Captain
Mackworth and the little bride held a recep-
tion subsequently in the nearly-completed
Melba Hall, at the University. The Bart-
telot pair, Mrs. Guise and Chamberlain
Nevill attended, and Emmertons, Millers,
Clarkes and others added either fashionable
feathers or brain-waves to the function,
Finally the bride put on a cream cloth suit
with a rose-colored sash and a smile, and
went off with her bridegroom to Diamond
Creek.
Ballarat takes its Arts and Crafts seri-
ously; so Alec Peacock spread his oratorical
tail during the recent opening of the Applied
Arts Exhibition. One of the interesting
personalities connected with the show is
Becky Macdonald, Mrs. President Brind’s
secretary. Becky is a smart Melbourne girl
who finds time to play the round game of
Society and write political stuff for leagues,
as well as doing the secretary job. Mrs.
Dr. Courtenay is responsible for a fine ex-
hibit of enamels, entirely her own work, from
first process to last. Melbourne matrons
who hail from Ballarat brought along
samples of their needlework, and blatted
more or less amiably. An Italian woman,
though, carried off the stitch honors with
some beautiful work of a kind that is seen
here only in the most expensive imported
trousseaus. She sits out in the sun doing
her exquisite stitches, and explains that, in
her native village, every housewife does the
same, as soon as the washing-up is done. The
village gossip flies up and down from one
shady vine-patch to another while the work
is going forward. Several Ballarat girls
have caught the craze, and, under the eye
of the expert, are trying the whole restful
process—bright silk head-scarf and all. I
think it is the head-scarf that attracts.
Ambrose Patterson has a choice assort-
ment of pictures suspended in a Centreway
room. The Denman lady drifted in unoffi-
cially last Thursday, and brought out a red
spot or two by stabbing her cheque-book.
Chamberlain Nevill fled upstairs ahead of the
partv to tell everyone who was coming ; and
the new Help, Captain Pollok, brought up
the rear, wearing his usual round-eyed ex-
pression of frozen amazement. The Best
People, who happened to be flocking to a
party below-stairs, on seeing Greatness
approach, suddenly remembered their invita-
tions and hurried along. Mrs. Hennessy,
who trifles with art, inspected the show
closely, and the Millers’ daughter Mary
struck an effective, willowy pose. Mrs.
Bowes Kelly, Mrs. Miller and Mrs. Hawley,
all expensively clad, rustled devotedly in
the train of her Ex., who peered at the can-
vases through a pair of spectacles mounted
on a skewer. Mrs. Ambrose was a charm-
ing uncatalogued feature of the show. The
little matron looked pretty as any picture in
a bunchy granny hat, a lovely complexion,
and a frock with a touch of blue in it.
The Repertory Theatre production of
“The Two Mr. Wetherbys,” in aid of the
Mission to the Streets and Lanes, attracted
to the Athenaeum an audience which con-
tained a fair number of non-theatregoers,
the result being that many of St. John
Hankin’s gibes and tilts at matrimony and
other highly respectable institutions were
greeted with outbursts of enthusiastic
silence. Mrs. Lowther Clarke, just back
from the Cold Country, where her gaitered
spouse has been making inquiries as to the
proper time for taking up the collection,
occupied a front stall. The daughter of
Merritt, M.L.C., sold confectionery, her
Amazonian stature provoking the customary
gasps of astonishment and admiration.
Three more engagements in the social vor-
tex : (1) Phyllis Clegg is billed to wed with
Simon Fraser, son of the rich Simon. (2)
The saucy little Commans girl, daughter of
Consul Commans, has said “Yes,” or words
to that effect, to Mr. Brownell, of Golds-
brough, Mort and Co. That is two flappers
disposed of matrimonially. The next case
(3) is that of the young widow Langlands
Jack. She is to wed with one of the several
Parliamentary Thompsons.
Ronald, second son of Toorak widow
Larking, and a fine specimen of Oxford
“tone,” has succumbed to Miss Mataas, a
nice Dutch girl. The Larkings will put in
another year travelling before returning to
these parts. It must be either very beauti-
ful or very boresome to belong to the
moneyed unemployed.
Pretty Fairlie Rede has opened a dogs’
coffee palace, for Most Exclusive brutes
only, at the maternal residence in Toorak.
Already a large pack of tykes in flowered
dressing-gowns bark together and annoy the
family bulldog, whose feelings have been
cruelly outraged. It appears to be his dear-
est wish to murder the whole lot. This dog
retreat will save the grey matter of the
fashionable tripper, who may now set out
contentedly and send the four-legged baby
picture postcards of the Pyramids.
Some time next month Marjorie, the
second daughter of Dr. Arthur Naylor, of
Loch (which is in Gippsland), is to take
Cecil Le Plastrier to husband. Cecil is a
patent attorney in the office of Phillips,
Ormonde and Co., and he speaks of the
bride-elect as the most wonderful invention
he has ever met.
There is sorrow in Toorak over the long
continued illness of the youthful Mrs.
Charles Bright, wife of the Deputy P.M.G.
“A little better, thanks,” is the latest sick-
room bulletin.
Mrs. Tallis turned up for the last Quinlan
night. The frocky lady with the figure had
been recovering from a chill acquired whilst
golfing.
Violet Paget, with husband Hugh Buckler
and other members of the co., plays tennis
every day when she is not travelling with
the show. This is a precaution against the
Flesh, which is the Devil. Whilst they
were appearing in Melbourne, the band of
mimes hired an asphalt tennis court,, and
the local nobility and gentry occasionally
brought along their racquets and joined in.
E. J. Tait, of Her Majesty’s, Melbourne,
'has been appointed general manager for
J.C.W., Ltd., in Sydney, and moves on at
once to that capital. I don’t know when
he will get there. Nobody knows nowadays
when he will get there, the express having
developed an apparently incurable habit of
dawdling. And it is just as bad on the
trip this way.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The Giles-Gale wedding occurred on Tuesday. The
last glad rites were performed by Archdeacon Bussell
and Mr. Bleby. By the time their moving job was
over there was not a dry female eye present—or, at
any rate, not many. At the Grand Central Hotel,
some time afterwards, a tall, dark girl, clad in
ivory-satin trappings, and guarded by a couple of
small fair-haired maidens, might have been observe
Yes, gentle Johanna, you have guessed ritrht n
was the bride. The children were the pronertv ,
her sister, Mrs. Keith Bowman. Mrs. Gale wasth °
in an amethyst frock covered by a coat of blaeW i„
Mrs. Keith Bowman's garment of champa^ e
also boasted a lace overdress. Others present i
eluded the Arthur Jervoises, Mrs. Michael HawiT
and her daughters, the Gordon MacFarlanes M™
Alan MacFarlane and her daughter, Mrs. Morris vt '
Jessop and a sprinkling of the Stokes family. ’ fS '
Mrs. F. J. Fisher gave an At Home at North
Adelaide on Tuesday—a sort of social swan-somT
uttered ere leaving town for the summer The left
motiv was, of course, tea; but there was a haunting
undertone of buns, exquisite flowers, etc. Societ
to a woman, practically speaking, attended the
entertainment. ue
On Friday the Victoria League Committee fare
welled Lady Bosanquet (who is also off to the Hillo
in the Zoological Gardens. There, while the monkevs
shrieked approval, and the crocodiles wept and the
birds sang, and the elephant thudded mournfully
round beneath its immature human load, tea was
drunk and food sunk, and all was bliss. ’ It was „
great day for the Zoo. a
Draper James Marshall (why not Draper Marshall
as well as Doctor Smith?) was married on Tuesday
to Miss Stacy, of Prospect. The get-away was accom-
plished with a quietude that amounted almost to
furtiveness. Enough if I mention in a stage whisper
that the Eastern States were headed for, and the
afternoon’s express patronised.
General Maria Gordon has been here on business-
military business, 1 mean. He stayed for the Steeple
on Wednesday, and greeted more friends on the lawn
in the course of one brief afternoon, than you would
imagine any one martial head could remember for
five minutes.
John Duncan’s death came with tragic suddenness.
He fell seriously ill on Sunday, was operated
upon on Monday morning, collapsed on Tuesday night,
and died early on Wednesday morning. He refused
office in more than one Ministry. As a youngster he
was the first to take the news of the discovery of the
Wallaroo copper mines to his uncle, Walter Hughes.
He came to South Australia from Scotland in '54
aged nine, and entered Parliament when he was 26’
He had large station properties in the Lower and
Upper North, and took a big part in the develop-
ment of the State’s copper industry.
’The S.A.J.C. Spring Meeting was a huge success.
In o'ther words, the weather was fine. On Saturday
Lady Bosanquet, accompanied by a white-clad daugh-
ter, wore a smart frock of purple crbpe, with a small
black hat. On Wednesday she wore a collarless frock
of blue ninon draped over white lace, and her daugh-
ters were in cool-looking ninon ; Miss Bosanquet in
cerise and black, and her sister in navy over helio-
trope pompadour silk. Others on the lawn were Mrs.
J. R. Baker, Mrs. Arthur Cudmore, Mrs. A. E.
Martin, Mrs. Kyffin Thomas, Mrs. Stanley Murray,
Mrs. H. S. Newland, Mrs. A. E. Tolley, Mrs. A. E.
Wigg (in a softly-made coat and skirt of black silk).
Mrs. McFarlane, Mrs. Swift (in a smart and cool
cream coat and skirt), Mrs. Turner, Mrs. O’Leary,
Mrs. George Bagot. The slit tailored skirt and high
boots of Rupert Clarke’s picturesque lady gave food
for conversation when all else failed.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

“Nulla” : With a judicious expenditure of
sin, skill, sweat and sorrow 1 can generally manage
to make some headway with the ordinary man-power
variety of boat; but as a snag and a takedown for
the uninitiated, commend me to the outback river
craft hight the “flattie.” Together with an un-
amphibious mate, I essayed to cross the Murrumbidgee
at Hay in one t'other day. Seizing the alleged oars,
my mate strove manfully, and at the end of 10
minutes we were fully five yards from the bank,
whereupon Bill, with characteristic unselfishness,
vacated his seat with the remark that I could have
a cut. My time for five yards was not so good as
Bill’s, but, by dint of frequent changes and much
blistering and bad language, we eventually won
through. The unkindest cut of all, however, came from
an ancient, hairy individual on the opposite bank,
who only stopped howling directions to us to emit
discordant chuckles at our progress. A poet has
mentioned something about “the rude forefathers of
the hamlet, but it wasn t until the ancient ventured
the opinion that “It’d take a long while t’ git t’
Wagga,” that I realised how really rude some fore-
fathers can be.
* * * #
“Gouger” : About, the softest snap Binghi
has in the eating line up North is that slow-footed
crawler, the porcupine. Hearing footsteps, the
animal turns into an animated pin-cushion, pointing
its thousand quills all over the compass, and waits,
kidding itself that mere bluff is going to stop the
prod of a spear. When turned on his back, the
quill fighter is helpless, exactly as the turtle. After
killing him, the natives throw him on the fire, with-
out plucking him. The quills fall out after a couple
of minutes, and a few turns suffice to roast him
beautifully. The flesh tastes exactly as I would
imagine the essence of duck, veal and ham to taste,
and I can’t think of any higher praise just now.
“Ess”: “Bex” (B. 18/9/’l3) inquires iJ
there is “any particular reason why there should be
such extreme color-difference in the eyes of Austra-
lian crows. The bulk of them (in his district) have
white eyes, while the optics of the remainder are
nearly black. This is not peculiar to any one part
of Australia. Well, Australia has two species of
crow and a raven, the latter being the most common.
Leach succinctly describes them in his Australian
Bird Book: “Hazel-eyed crow ( Corvus coronoides)
Australia, nomadic, common, open country and
timber; 20 inches in length. Black, glossed with
purple; white down, hazel eyes; female smaller.
Feeds on insects, carrion, fruit; not lambs. Small-
billed crow (C. bennetti ), West-N.S.W., V., S.A.,
Stationary, very rare, frequent plains; 18.5 inches.’
Like the other, but smaller; bill small, eye white;
female similar. Insects, carrion. Australian raven
(C. marianae) , A., Tas. Nomadic, very common;
plains, timber; 20 inches. Black, glossed with
purple; throat feathers lanceolate, tinged green;
down dusky grey; eyes white; female smaller.
Omnivorous, destructive.” The latter is the scamp
responsible for most of the depredations for which
the family is vilified. Against him the crows, which
are for the most part useful birds, have a strong
case for defamation of character, for nearly every-
where he is called a crow. Excepting for the evil
streak in the raven, both have practically the same
habits; their nests are similar (open bulky struc-
tures well built of sticks and twigs, and lined with
soft bark or fibre) and each lays four or five greenish
cftgs, spotted and blotched with brown. Neverthe-
less, the raven is entitled to precedence by his
slightly greater size, and from the fact that he is
considered by anatomists to be “the most highly
developed of birds.” He is more cunning than the
crow and he can disgorge his food at will, which
makes him a most difficult bird to poison. What
distinguishes him (apart from the slight difference
between the relative lengths of the first primary and
the innnermost secondaries) is fhat .he is biacker
than the crow. His feathers are black right down to his
skin, while the base of the crow's feathers, o:i the
neck and body are snow-white. Thus, when a per-
son sees one of the sable rogues on the top of a high
gum, all he has to do is to part the feathers, and he
will be able to tell at a glance if the bird is a crow
or a raven. IT. J. MeCooev was a great champion of
the crow, which he considered the most valuable
scavenger in Australia, and without equal as a
noxious insect destroyer. Pastoralists, instead of
paying large sums annually for the destruction of
crows, should use their endeavors to protect f lv'm
because if they were exterminated the pastoralists
would he confronted with overwhelming plagues of
flies (the blowfly is already an increasing scourge
among sheep) against which he would be positively
defenceless.

“McNorth”: In Thursday Island the other
afternoon I saw a discolored sister who took my
fancy. She was sauntering along with studied care-
lessness, holding over her head a parasol like unto
Joseph's coat of many hues. It was a gorgeous thing.
Her blouse was of pink -silk, and cut low, exposing
a broad ebony bosom. Her, skirt was of the latest
mode, and none too long, in the approved fashion.
“A pleasing illustration of what contact with the
European can do for the pore black,” I thought to
myself as my eye ran down to her feet. The shock
came there. She wore neither boots nor stockings!
Tier great black feet spread out beneath her like two
ill-kept frying-pans.

ENRAGED COCKY:
"'Ere, ’ow often

FARM HAND: “Garn, yer no sport to shoot a bird in 'is nest."
Leo Lear”: What about putting the
photograph of platypus on the national stamp? Old
duck-bill has given evolution about the biggest
assistance the cause ever got. With the porcupine,
he is the sole survivor of a large animal class that
formerly inhabited the earth. He is the lowest of
existing mammals. He contains characteristics of
both reptiles and mammals. • Finally, he is of Aus-
tralia only. There are a few points I’d like cleared
up about this burrowing water animal. Why don’t
mobs of them get herded together at the source of
rivers ? I’ve watched platypus in many streams
and seldom seen them going with the current. When
they dive it’s 10 to one they come to the surface
again up stream. Is there any truth in the bush
belief that red robins and platypus inhabit the same
stretch of country? How far do platypus extend,
anyhow? On the mainland I’ve seen them south of
the tropics in Queensland, in N.S.W., Vic. and part
of S.A. How about the Gulf and the Territory?
THE ENSANGUINED
ANIMAL.
MUG RIDER ( holding his damaged
nose): "Yah! You beast!
know now why they said you
were a blood horse.”
Eddyson”: One of (ho qua >'n tost chnr-
aoters I have met with in 40 years was Galvin.
Galvin had been a civil servant, or something of the
kind, but had taken to liquor and literature rather
late in life. He could do little patches of verse
rather neatly, and might have been a piquant essay-
ist in a nation with a taste for literarv prettiness.
As it was, Australian journalism hadn’t much use
for Tim Galvin, and Tim never seemed to possess
more than sixpence, and was the gloomiest member
of a bunch of Melbourne Bohemians who anxiously
pursued art, literature and music in quest of tray-
bits. Galvin’s most marked peculiarity was a hor-
ror of corners. With regard to all other matters he
was perfectly normal, if a trifle lacking in gaiety,
but his attitude towards corners amounted to a
monomania. Street corners were his special detesta-
tion, but he had also a profound suspicion of corners
of buildings, or any constructed angle he couldn’t
see round. If you were walking the asphalt with
lim you observed a marked nervousness in him as
he approached a corner; his pace slackened, he
ere-t nearer the walls, he betrayed a disposition to
sneak forward and peer cautiously when within a few
paces, and when the dreaded angle was passed it
was with a sigh of relief and a burst of buoyancy.
Wien alone Galvin actually did steal feverishly up
to the corners, and peep round before venturing to
pass, much as a man might do who had reasonable
grounds for the belief that a famished tiger was free
in the city, and was likely to be lurking at the
turn for a stray lunch. Galvin never grew
accustomed to his trouble. After three years the
front left-hand corner of the cottage in which the
Bohemian brothers resided remained as dubious u
turning-point to Tim as any in the city. Victor
Daley s explanation that Galvin was always expecting
to come face to face with a dangerous creditor was
not held* to be satisfactory, for the reason that
poor Tim never had an opportunity of owing anybody
anything; and Galvin himself gave no reasons.
Long after the bunch of Bohemians was scattered far
and wide, Galvin was killed in a street in South
Melbourne by a bicyclist who came suddenly round
at high speed, and hurled the hapless ex-scribe against
a tree-guard. The long arm of coincidence stretches
much further. These recollections were stirred by
a recent meeting with Galvin’s widow. “And poor
Tim was always suspicious of corners,” she said.
His father was killed by a bolting horse at a street
corner seven weeks before he was born.”
* * *
“Chin”: At an hotel in Clare (S.A.) a
young fellow who was silly enough to get drunk,
but not too silly to know that bed was the best
place for him, entered by mistake a balcony bedroom
occupied by two girls. On seeing the invader one of
the girls shrieked: “Oh, there’s a man in the room!”
Whereupon the drunk: “Wher ish he? Show ’im er
me! I’ll soon chuck ’im out for yer.” Who says
chivalry is dead?
* * * *
S.T.S.”: Is it really a marked Australian
fault to double the negatives? Eleanor Mordaunt’s
new novel, “Lu of the Ranges,” dealing with the
mountain district of Victoria, makes the local n ,

body never not see nothing of never a , no '

( nmp : I’m satisfied as to the tracking
capabilities of Black Brother (the missionary’s bro-
ther, not mine). Years before the Vic. mallee was
thought of as a wheat-producing country, I was sent
up to a run in the Swan Hill district to take charge
of a draft of sheep for the Melbourne market. We
pitched camp near the homestead. It was well on in
the afternoon when we finished drafting, and we
deferred our start for the South until next morning.
In the evening 1 went up to the house to interview
the squatter, a big, grey-bearded, rotund man. Busi-
ness finished, we adjourned to the verandah, and he
introduced me to Mrs. Squatter, a prepossessing lady,
young enough to be his third daughter. Bottles and
glasses were produced, and my mouth was watering in
anticipation of sampling a promising-looking whisky
which old Mac ’was handing me, when Mrs. Mac. in-
tervened by bringing under my notice a bottle with
a home-made label containing what she proudly
described as a non-intoxicating mulberry wine of
her own manufacture. “You forget, Donald,’’ she
said to her husband, “that everyone is not as fond
of whisky as you are, and Mr. Camp might prefer
some of my wine.” 1, of course, declared for the
mulberry concoction. What else could a fellow do?
Never, since my boyhood days, when my mother, in
an excess of maternal solicitude, would tightly grip
my nose with one hand the while she tipped a
tablespoonful of castor-oil down my throat with
the other, was I made the sarcophagus of such a
nauseating dose. However, I was young and polite
(and therefore a liar), so I praised the beastly stuff
for all I was worth. Mrs. Mac beamed, and, as I
rose to go, she pressed me to take the bottle of
wine with me, at the same time explaining that
it was the last of the vat, or brew, or whatever it
was. On my way back to eamp I struck a match,
wrote across the label “POISON,” and planted the
bottle in a hollow stump off the track. Next morn-
ing Mr. and Mrs. Mac. drove down to see us off the
run Mac, overhearing me ask one of my men for
he loan of a knife, as I had lost mine on the way
ack to the camp, butted in: “If you lost your knife
between here and the house, Snowy (indicating the
black boy he had with him to open gates) will find
it. Forthwith he ordered the “nig” to run my
tracks. Sending my men forward with the sheep, I
remained with the squatter and his wife to await
the return of Snowy. I put in some good work tell-
ing Mrs. Mac how I had appreciated her wine, and
made a frank confession to the effect that the flavor
gripped my fancy so hard that I had finished the
lot before turning-in on the previous night. I was
saying what a great thing it would be if her bever-
age could be largely introduced so as to push the
whisky bottles clean off the pub-shelves, when Snowy
suddenly re-introduced himself with: “Baal find ’em
Knife, Mr. Taggat—only this one-phella bottle
planted longa stump.” The cold eye of pretty Mrs.
Mac and the guffaw of the old man are with me
until this day.

Our claim’s the blanky township’s hub,
Now we are gettin’ gold.

For we want smiles from all we meet,
When we are gettin’ gold.]

An’ tradesmen now no longer smile.
We’ll have tc pay ’em by the mile,

£ f da Y we are the largest piano firm doing business in the Commonwealth is due solely to the
quality of our instruments.
i .... l laS een s P ared in the manufacture of Beale Pianos to reach perfection of tone and ensure
it} • o da\ our instruments stand absolutely unrivalled in those respects.
, , B '" ale B * anos are s P ecia Hy designed and made to meet all the exigencies of the ‘Australian climate. They
embody every improvement known in piano construction, and are made under the direct supervision of an expert who
ma e scientific piano manufacture a life study. In addition, they possess special features which you cannot get in
er pianos , such as our permanent steel tuning-system, hexagonal bass-strings, patent cast-in hitch-pins, and our
patent method of building up the casework.
The Beale Permanent Steel Tuning System renders what was hitherto the weakest part of a piano the strongest,
n e\ery Beale Piano the wrest-plank is made of solid iron. The wrest-plank is that part of the piano into which are
men the tuning pins to which are attached the wires (or “strings”). In every imported piano the wrest-plank is
made of wood, which has to bear the strain (about 20 tons) of all the wires when the piano is in tune. So that in every
piano that has a wooden wrest-plank there is a probability of the wrest-plank splitting and the piano becoming untunable
in consequence. And in every piano but the Beale the wrest-plank is made of wood.
In all Beale Pianos the wrest-plank is solid iron, a part of the iron frame itself.
Write for our special booklets explaining this matter in detail.
We have recently put on the market the Beale Player-Piano. The Beale Player-Piano possesses the finest
mechanism it is possible to produce, fitted in a Beale high-grade piano of handsome appearance. The artistic possi-
bilities of the interpretation of a roll on the Beale Player-Piano are limited only by the artistic temperament of the
performer. The mechanism is so delicately regulated and every control so perfect that it is easier to play than any other
piano-player.
FREE EIFE INSURANCE: We supply, when requested, 3 Free Rife Insurance Policy, without any charge
whatever, to buyers of Beale Pianos. This covers the life of the customer during the course of hire-purchase, and
insures a valuable and saleable asset to the family without further payment in case of bereavement. The Policy is a
purely free gift from Beale and Co., Ltd., so that no other person may claim under it than the person named by the
customer when accepted by us.
All Beale Pianos carry our written guarantee for Twenty-five Years.
A Beale Piano is lower in price, quality for quality, than any other piano you can buy, and in after cost it is
also cheaper, because it requires far less tuning and less frequent expert attention in every way.
PARTS : Should you by accident damage your Beale Piano we can always replace any injured or broken
parts at a very low cost to you, because we are the actual makers, with our factory facilities here in Australia. But if
you buy an imported piano, and it gets damaged, you will find it expensive to repair, because the agents have no factory
facilities here and they do not carry stocks of spare parts.

“Gordon G.” : I guess I can put in a fair
claim to having lighted on the Absolute Last Word
in juror’s sagacity. Twelve of us had been
engaged in hearing a charge of larceny from a dwell-
ing. The Sagacious One and I had held out for
nearly two hours against our 10 opponents, who
were in favor of an acquittal. I had harangued our
adversaries at great length, but, in spite of my
most persistent entreaties, was unable to induce my
comrade to utter anything more than a monosyl-
lable. The result was disagreement. I selected
my friend as the only fit person in the crowd to
accompany me from the court to the nearest tea-
rooms. During the stroll, talk naturally reverted
to the “case,” and the 10 mugs with whom we had
been closeted. “I think I put it plainly enough to
them, eh?” I ventured. “Why, dammit, the evi-
dence was clear enough, and the summing-up was
all against the poor devil.” “Oh, yes, you didn’t do
bad,” he returned ; “but I never take much notice o’
the bloomin’ lawyers and judges and witnesses an’ all
the rest o’ them, y’know.” I became interested.
“Yer see, Mister Wotsyername, I’ve ’ad a good bit
o’ hexperience with these ’ere criminal blokes, an’
what I does is this. Soon’s I get inter me place, I
jes fixes me heye on the prisoner. I looks ’im up
and down fur a few minutes —’e knows darned well
I’m sizin’ ’im up—and then I jes sits back and
waits a bit. After a while I ’as another good quiz
at ’im, and then I ses to meself, ‘Ther cow ’e mus’
be guilty, or wot ’ud ’e be ’ere for?’ ” I staggered
and suggested a pub instead of the tea-rooms.
THE BEER WORM WILL TURN.
The Good Lady (after half an hour's lec-
ture): “You cannot deceive me. T know

The Applicant (bitterly): “I guessed it,

could 'e do ? ”
“S. S. Severn”: Garea, my house boy, was
a native of Courabada (Papua). He “made” the
table and served my food with a lordly dignity that
a bishop’s butler need not have despised. One day
two distinguished visitors from a gunboat dropped
in to lunch. The curry looked lovely, but Garea had
forgotten the rice. I tried to catch his eye, but it
was fascinated by the guests’ gold lace. “Garea,” I
murmured, “rice milaia” (bring rice). “Oh, Sina-
bada,” he said apologetically, “I too many bl —dy
fool!” He meant, merely, that it was forgetful of
him.

OWNER: “Oh, you stood your ground nobly, Dick.
“R.V.”: It’s cow, cow, cow, till you’d
think there wasn’t another brain-numbing, soul-de-
stroying curse in the country. But what about
sheep? Consider the life of the average station-hand.
He gets up at daylight, or before, eats sheep and
talks sheep, saddles his horse, and musters, droves
or drafts sheep. At 12 o’clock, or thereabouts, he
boils his quart, masticates sheep and blathers sheep.
Then all through a blazing afternoon
he tails sheep. At teatime he chews
and blathers sheep. Then over a pes-
tiferous slush lamp or spluttering
candle he argues, wrangles and some-
times fights over sheep, and all
through a steaming night he dreams
sheep. Day after day, year in and
year out. the same dreary, desolate,
hellish routine with sheep to begin
with, and sheep to go on with,
and sheep to end with. Were it
not for the yearly trip to the
nearest country town, where a week of
lurid living relieves the pent-up, pas-
sionate longings of a healthy human
being, our receiving houses would be
full of Jims and Bills gibbering sheep.
Can one wonder at so many of them
holding pessimistic views? Present
scribe thought his cup of bitterness
was full what time he stood on the
doorstep of his country printing office
and heaped curses on and hurled
challenges at the bailiff as he made
an inventory of his shaky hand-press,
dilapidated formes and obsolete types. But the cup
was far from brimming over; how far he only
found out when he had to earn a precarious living
amongst sheep.

cause of its large milk crop. The world’s record for
butter yield is held by Pontiac Lass, a Holstein, in
America. She produced 441 b. in seven days—a per-
formance which whipped her price up to £2OOO
when she was offered for sale. We want some
Pontiac lasses badly. The average for all Australia
is under 300 gallons of milk per cow per annum,
which is less than half Denmark’s average. But,
then, Denmark goes in for systematic testing, and
cows not up to the mark are butchered. What are
called the State Supervision areas in Victoria com-
prise about a sixth of its territory. Within these
areas the average is 475 gallons, but outside it is
only 302. Take another proof of the value of test-
ing. In 1884 the average Danish production was
1121 b. of butter per cow. In 1908 it was up to
just double, 2241 b. The whole explanation is that
Co-operative Testing Associations were started mean-
time —in 1895. The same thing must happen in
Australia, which is now wasting fodder and labor
on thousands of animals that, for the good of the
species, ought to be hurried by the nearest route to
the beef-shop.
“R. Brothers”: A man leans against a
verandah post by the opening of one of the arcades,
quietly enjoying a smoke and sc spit across the
footpath. Towards him shuffles a man in broken
boots and clothes which shout for the destructor. A
battered boxer hat is dragged down at the back of
his head to that extent that the tops of his ears lap
at right angles. His manner is chastened as of one
who has seen light. The smoker spits right in front
of him, and he stops and looks at the moisture with
the look of one who is horrified, and then he turns
to the man it came from with a withering ex-
pression.
“Some blokes oughter go en get shot,” he says.
“What’s er matter ?” asks the smoker.
“Yer oughter go en get boiled,” says the horrified
one. “If yer wants ter spit, why don’t yer do it in
the gutter? S’pose yer don’t know yer can get
fined five bob or the risin’ for spittin’ on the foot-
paths? If yer don’t know yer oughter know, en it’s
little enough. It ought ter be six munce hard.
Wot’s the good of the risin’ when yer goes there for
fun, like enough. It ought ter be six munce.”
The smoker, to show his indifference, spits at the
reformer’s right boot, but the reformer is too quick.
“It ought ter be a year, that’s wot it ought ter
be,” says the vagrant. “If yer pinches anything, it’s
a year, en spittin’ is worse than pinchin’. For
why”
The smoker has another attempt, but the speaker
dodges without an interruption.
“becos spittin’ is murder.”
He pauses to mark the effect of his statement.
“S’pose yer don’t know it’s murder, en I know
why yers don’t know it’s murder. It’s becos of yer
iggerance, that’s why. It’s blokes like yous wot is
killing people; there is people in ’orsepittals dyin’
becos of you, en that’s why it’s murder. Dyin’, I
says, becos of yous blokes spittin’. Don’t yer know
that it causes toober-something or other that is only
another name for consumption, en that’s why I alius
says the bloke wot spits oughter get hung. Wot’s the
good of the risin’ to stop it? Blokes don’t mind
the risin’. They likes it, becos it fills in the mornin’,
en they ’ears the cases bein’ tried. They oughter get
hung be the neck till they’re dead, en a jolly good
riddance.”
Several times during this long speech he hastily
shifts one or the other foot. He pauses to think then,
as if to remember: —
“It’s a disgustin’ ’abit, ennyhow,” he says.
After another pause, he goes on:—
“It’s filthy. S’pose yer don’t think of the skirts
wot ’as ter walk along the pavement after you’ve
done with it? If a bloke with a skirt only took the
law in his own hands, en dealt with yer, yer’d stop
it quick enough, I bet. If the blokes with skirts
pulled out their revolvers (if they ’ad one) en shot
yer dead, nuthin’ would be done to ’em, becos every-
body would say it serves yer right, spittin’ all over
the place where people ’as ter walk. Yer oughter get
boiled, yer ought—boiled in tar. I on’y wish the
Gov’ment would let me deal with yer. I’d put a
stop ter spittin’ quick en lively. I’d bury yer alive,
en play Yankee Doodle on yer grave.”
“That’s enough, bloke,” says the smoker. “Come,
get a move on.”
“I’d give yer wot for”
“Shut up, en get,” says the smoker, angrily. “I’ve
had enough of it. Get, or” And he makes as
if he means to kick.
“Oh, very well,” says the vagrant. “But all the
luck I wish yer is that a cop comes along en nabs
yer, that’s all.”
And he shuffles off.
Another man with his hands deep in his pockets
lounges up at this moment: —
“Do yer know him?” he asks, jerking his head
sideways in the direction of the reformer.
“No. Why?”
“Oh, nuthin’. Only he just got the rising for spit-
ting in Pitt-street. The magistrate gave him a
fair talkin’ to, my oath!”
“Mint”: Who said the days 0 f kniehr
errantry were over? One wet night recently '
baron, who was supposed to be working late
office, arrived at his castle unexpectedly and f •
his wife sitting on a strange man’s knee °T

Ah, no ! I’d rather do the trip
At thirty miles an hour.
No plumes shall deck my four-wheeled biw,
When I am cased in lead.
No immortelles all frowsed and drear,
May shiver overhead ;
For if my pace in Life’s been swift,
Be speed my parting dower,
And let me make my final shift
At thirty miles an hour.
Yes, give to me the speedy mote,
Picked out in red, mayhap,
A neat chauffeur with braided coat
And silver on his cap ;
Let coppers wave their arms and curse,
And traffic blokes “go sour” —
For me the flying motor-hearse
At thirty miles an hour.

HORACE HALLORAN.
The Paces in Our Northern Window.
From an Australian long resident in China ■
In the short period of six years history has re’
markably and unpleasantly repeated itself with
gard to Chinese affairs. In 1907 the cognoscenti
were apprehensive of an outbreak of war between
Japan and the U.S.A., and there were signs that th»
man in the street thought he could read Then
when Japans swelled head had almost reached burst
ing point, the Government realised that such a war
would be impossible, for financial reasons Verv
opportunely the much-debated Tatsu Maru II i nP j
dent happened at Macao, and the Ministry diverted
the attention of the swelled-head people towards
poor old scapegoat China, who got it severely and
unjustly in the neck. Now, again, after rumors of
war between Uncle Sam and Uncle Jap over the
Californian Land Bill and the Mexican concessions
the unscrupulous little brown man has made another
demand for a pound of China’s flesh—in fact, it looks
like a request for liewt. of best meat, with the head
attached.
The utter disproportion of Japan’s demands is seen
when they are placed side by side with the cause of
them. During the recent insurrection at Nankin, Japan-
ese soldiers assisted the revolutionaries. It is now de-
clared by Japan that its soldiers assisted without
leave. After the town was taken the Government
troops found two or three Japs looting, and after
the recognised international custom, shot them. Now
as an indemnity, Japan demands the extension of the
lease of Port Arthur by 50 years, and the right to
establish military bases at Amoy and Foochow. These
two cities are just about opposite the north and
south extremities of strongly-fortified Formosa, and
there is little doubt that the whole province will
ultimately be annexed by Japan, by what have been
described as “Manchurian methods/’ These methods
have been described by Putnam Whale and Mac-
kenzie, and may be regarded as the Japanese ideal
of a peaceful invasion. They are commended to the
notice of the dilatory Australian Defence Depart-
ment as a sort of hurry call to arm and organise
all males of a fighting age.
Jap troops marched through Korea, and their
route was marked by rotting crops and general
ravage. The simple Korean farmer was shot, if
found working in the field, probably on the pretext
that his primitive agricultural implement was really
a military weapon. If he was not working he was
shot just the same. That is how room was made for
the 4000 immigrants that are arriving there monthly.
More hideous still are the suggestions and statements
of Whale, who baldly declares that the Japanese
Government poured hundreds of diseased harridans
into the country. It would be very pleasant to have
a Japanese colony in the Northern Territory.
In its travail China apparently sees no hope for
the present, and expects that it will be able to do
little off its own equivalent for a bat in the imme-
diate future. As a set-off to Japan's demands, it
has, therefore, granted to Russia Mongolian conces-
sions which that country has long desired in order
to strengthen its far-eastern frontier. It is beyond
reasonable doubt that these concessions have been
made by China in the knowledge that Russia must

one day wipe out the stigma of its defeat done,
too, in the hope that that day will soon be due.
Meanwhile, one who has seen the immense army
stores at Vladivostock, and seen, too. the fine type
of colonist that is pouring into the hinterland, can
only wonder how long it will be before the Japanese
frog will be loaded up with something more soliu
than his own conceit.

GAVE ALL A FAIR TRIAL.
“For years I suffered from bronch'tis, although
I tried many patent medicines and doctors’ prescrip-

Lennon, Bridge Road, Drummoyne (N.S.W.). “Then
I tried Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy, and from the
first dose got relief, and kept on getting better.
Sometimes in the winter I get a return of my old
complaint, but in a very mild way, for Chamber
lain’s Cough Remedy soon puts me right.”*

On October 1 the N.S.W. Leg. Assembly,
having been sitting continuously for 20
hours, passed without discussion, as
quickly as the Minister for Works could
gabble through a few staccato sentences,
seven or eight Public Works proposals in-
volving an expenditure of £1,450,000. This
crop of Bills was passed without amend-
ment, through all their stages, at the one
sitting, and all of them were galloped off
to the Leg. Council. With the revenue and
loan accounts heavily overdrawn it is doubt-
ful whether any of the proposals will get
beyond the paper stage for years, but with
election day drawing near that is a mere
matter of detail. The advertisement’s the
thing.
George Elmslie, Prendergast’s successor
as leader of the Vic. Labor party, should stir
things up in the country. Melbourne is
fairly solid for Labor already ; yet “Pren ”
neglected to cultivate the country, and went
on cultivating what was well cultivated
already. Elmslie ought to do the other thing.
And if he can travel with his boots off, so
much the better, as then the farmers will
be able to see that he hasn’t cloven hoofs.
Many Vic. farmers believe that all the
Labor crowd have horns and a tail as well;
so the mere appearance of Elmslie will do
good. But he will never do much while
he stays in Melbourne.
Angus, M.L.A., talking to the bucolics of
Kerang (Vic.), deplored the proposed elec-
trification of railways in Melbourne as being
“detrimental to country development.” He
might have forcibly remarked that Govern-
ment expenditure these times should be
mainly directed to carrying civilisation into
the backblocks, but to protest against elec-
trification of town railways because country
folk have no use for them seems much the
same thing as objecting to asphalted foot-
paths, electric lighting facilities, motor
’buses and the Quinlan Opera Co. All these
features of crowded city life are detrimental
to country development, from a one-eyed
Angus point of view, but not so detrimental
as the selfish narrowness of the average shire
councillor to whom Angus was addressing
his bleat.
“Don Q.” : I see that that reliable blather-
skite, Ben Til let t, addressing 10,000 trades
unionists at Southampton the other day,
advised the strikers to "arm themselves with
the most murderous guns, and be drilled by
ex-soldiers and sailors in order to protect
themselves.” It was quite recently that the
same ass was braying against a citizen army
of these same people, to protect the same
identical fraternity.
Australia pulled off a new advt. during
the London ’busmen’s strike. The Tillings
co. there objected to the men wearing a
union badge, and when business was held
up for some days the similarity of the
quarrel to that of the Brisbane Tramway
strike caused the judgment of Justice Hig-
gins to be looked up and widely discussed.
The outcome was that Tillings and co. with-
drew their objection ; and now, according to
a Sydney man in London, you can’t sit
alongside a London ’busman without hear-
ing what a great place Australia is.
The four lovely United States citizens con-
demned to death for murdering Rosenthal,
the “squealer,” at the instance of Charles
Becker, lieutenant of Noo York police, were
named Cerofici, Horowitz, Rosenberg and
Seidenscher. That is to say, a corrupt
policeman of German parentage, desiring to
remove a Jew gambler who had accused him
of blackmailery and grafting, hired one Dago
and three German Jews to do the killing.
Zelig, the captain of the murderous gang,
had himself been murdered by one of his
mates, so the Law couldn’t touch him. The
conspirators who turned informers, in this
interesting case, are named Rose, Yallon,
Schrapps, Reich, Paul, Shapiro and Fax.
This collection of names might be cited as
evidence that the Anglo-Saxon race is pass-
ing out of the United States. On the other
hand, it suggests that the criminality of the
States is mostly foreign to the stock that
Franklin, Lincoln, Garfield, Hawthorne,
Longfellow, Edison and Livingston Hopkins
(of The Bulletin) sprang from. Which sug-
gestion is worth consideration whenever a
scheme for dumping white alien immigrants
in Australia is mooted by cheap-labor parties.
Preserve us from Seidenscher, Zelig,
Schrapps and Shapira—especially the first,
because his name is hardest to spell.
“Orient”: Palpably it is the Japanese
Government that is publishing Ambassador
Hayashi’s despatches, by instalments, in the
principal Tokio newspaper, the Shimbun ;
and the only object of it can be to humiliate
Britain. Hitherto the idea has been that,
with magnificent condescension, Foreign
Minister Lansdowne negotiated the alliance,
on a humble belly-crawl by Japan. Now it
mysteriously emerges that, instead of going
down on its waistcoat, Japan had a rod in
pickle. Britain wanted Germany to be in
the Alliance. Japan wouldn’t have that at
any price, and Britain apparently would not
have gone in on a lone hand but for Japan’s
alternative —an alliance with Russia. Ito
was even sent to St. Petersburg on the pre-
tence of negotiating this alliance, and it was
because he went too far that Russia entered
into the subsequent war with gusto. The
whole business is a puzzle; but out of the
dark I seem to see that our years of grace
may be up much sooner than we thought.
The Chief Secretary of Victoria announces
himself opposed to the abolition of the kilt
“because it means removing the one bit of
bright coloring from our defence force.” Save
us from our friends; —our enemies would
oppose the change for exactly the same
reason. A bit of bright clothing is a fine
mark for a long-range rifle.
“Billy T.” : Dr. Jones, Victoria’s Medical
Superintendent of the Insane, back from the
Medical Congress, emphasises the opinion of
the profession that this old world is going
more markedly off its chump—such chump
as it possesses—every year. He points out
that “something must be done.” Why?
When everybody is mad, nobody will be ab-
normal, and there will be no need for Medi-
cal Superintendents of the Insane, for
every lunatic will be sane and nobody
will be mad save the individual who is in
his right mind. There is a chance, and not
a bad one, that the general tone and quality
of our affairs may be improved under the new
conditions. But by what right do we assume
that the world is sane? Unfortunately,
we have no standards of comparison. One
might make out a very excellent case in
support of the theory that our earth is
really the madhouse of the universe,
From “Yanco”:—
The most diverse yarns are in circulation here
concerning the amount of money which Samuel
McCaughey—the Irishman who doesn’t consider Ire-
land good enough to live in—has given to boost up
the cause which aims at preventing Ireland from en-
joying the same form of government as the country
which McCaughey inhabits for preference. Some say
that the wildly illogical oldster’s cheque was for
£30,000. Others point to the fact that he is at
large, by way of refutation of the charge; and the
argument is mostly held to be valid. It is at this
stage that his dark and guilty Past rises up and
bears testimony against him. It is remembered
that he gave £lO,OOO to the demented old Dread-
nought Fund. A sheep, or other Emperor who was
capable of such folly as that would, it is felt, be
liable to do anything in the way of lavishing good
money on bad, not to say utterly senseless, schemes.
40 years of newspaper work
William Sholto Douglas, editor of Auck-
land (M.L.) Herald, is dead. He started
on the long job with the pen in 1873 in the
Gold Country and five years later climbed
into the editorial chair on the Leeds Daily
News. It was from there the Auckland
Herald imported him, as a leader writer,
in 1882, and 21 years later he was
appointed to the controlling position.
Sydney and Melbourne knew him for
years (although they were not aware of
it) as Maoriland correspondent of the
Morning Herald and Argus.
From the Oldest Inhabitant: —
Apropos Charles Windeyer (B. 18/9/’l3). He was
the first official Mayor of Sydney, which means
that, when Governor Gipps decided that the people of
Sydney should make and keep in. repair their own
streets, he proclaimed a “Corporation,” which was
the precursor of that elected by the citizens. The
Governor nominated the aldermen, all of them public
officials. For Gipps Ward the nominee was Hutchin-
®on Browne, Immigration Agent; for Bourke
ward, William Augustus Miles, Commissioner of
Police; for Brisbane Ward, Charles Windeyer, Police
Magistrate; for Cook Ward, Francis Lewis Shaw
Mcrewether, Clerk of the Executive Council; for
* " Joseph Long Innes, Police Magistrate;
ioi Macquarie Ward, John Ryan Brenan, Attorney and
Coroner. Windeyer was appointed to act as Mayor,
this nominated corporation got the machinery well
oiled and running for the first election, which took
place on November 1, 1842. On November 9, John
Hoskmg, son-in-law of Sam Terry, was elected Mayor ;
but a commercial storm passed over Sydney imme-
diately afterwards, and in it Hosking was totally
dismasted, and sprang a number of financial leaks
All efforts to pump him out having failed, he resigned
his office, and J. R. Wilshire was elected for the
remainder of the term. Quite recently an official of
the Corporation, seeking for something else, dis-
covered the first ratebook, with the names of the
first ratepayers, their assessments, their holdings and
their homes. The volume when found was damp and
smellful. Deputy-Town-Clerk Layton promptly detailed
several clerks to have the entries accurately copied,
so that it will “appear in its habit as it lived,” and
be an interesting record of the first days of the city
Though incorporated under the same Act and in the
same year, Melbourne did not become a “city” until
1847, when it was created one by Letters Patent
Therefore the ratepayers of Sydney were termed
“citizens” from 1842 onwards, while those of Mel-
bourne remained “burgesses” until 1847.
An old resident of the Sydney “Rocks,”
daughter of a Sydney native, whose parents
dated from the earliest days, lately left a
record not often equalled. She was the
mother of 20 children, all born in one house
on the ttocks. Sixteen of these children she
reared to manhood and womanhood. A suitor
from Somerset married the eldest .
She died after having had a faS 7'
widower then married the youngest \lanll he
—the youngest child of the 20— and shi gh i er
had a family. How manv granrlnvuu e a * so
old lady left isn’t known fo the OhW ’ T he
habitant. Perhaps nobody ever coated lo '

“Briner” : Cabled that a new cruiser
be chnstened the Calliope. The old one of
that name is renowned for getting out o
Apm Harbor, Samoa, in 1889, when the ter
nhc hurricane came thundering in with
tidal waves. Three United Stalls warships
were there, the Nipsic, Trenton and Vada-
£'s German, the Olga and Eber
Both of the Germans were wrecked with
great loss of life. Of the Americans, th
iNipsic was flung on the beach, but was
saved; the Trenton and Vadalia weS
smashed on coral reefs. Stevenson was at
Samoa, and wrote a vivid accovit of the Pal
hope steaming out, in the teeth of the bm
ncane, under Captain Kane. The vessel
was using Westport (M.L.) coal, and the
U estport Co. is still minting dividends out
of the great advt. it got thereby.
“Norseman” : For years I was an advocate
for the abolition of pubs in Australia, and
min a at „ °PP° u ents ammunition
bianded Mildura, which was prepared bv
Christian leagues and associations whom I
believed honest. Maybe they were honest
but, it so, they must have been densely
ignorant. Some time ago I was destined to
toil near Mildura, and, since then, anvbodv
can have my share of no-license. It’s a
fraud for everybody but the local clubs. On
a f re J . < i en t Saturday, in one of these, I saw one
of the wildest scenes raging I have ever
witnessed in the booze business. Three bar-
men were pumping beer at the rate of 67
long sleevers a minute. Anyhow’, that was
my calculation in the early part of the even-
ing. Later in the night, I reckon the speed
had increased to 135 a minute, and was
maintained at that until 11.30 p.m. Even
then it wasn’t fast enough for the mob, and
the pathetic appeals to the barmen to “get
a move on” would have melted a whole Band
of Hope conference. Next dav I wandered
along the \ ictorian bank of the Murray, and
it the bottle-oh merchants have any desire
to gather at the river, let me recommend that
locality to the congregation.

there is not only in the smooth, close shave which the
sharp stropped blade of an Auto Strop ensures, but in t e
simplicity of its use also.
It takes far less time to strop an Auto Strop blade (and so keep it in the pink of
than to put a new blade into a non-stropping safety razor. The Auto Strop is the on y
that strops itself and consequently SAVES CONSTANT EXPENSE FOR BLADES.

POLITICAL
POINTS
“Hock’s” observation :
The Bulletin’s remark that the present system
of party government makes possible the return of
inuckrakers like Fitzpatrick and Levy is true; still no
"tie is much worse off when such inflictions act up to
Fieir natural inclinations. It is when men like
Irvine and Glynn put the welfare of party before
country, as they did in connection with the lately
proposed Constitutional amendments, that the Com-
monwealth pays dearly for the party madness.
Big H. V. McKay, of the Sunshine Works,
near Melbourne, who mixes a lot of public
spirit with his money-making, has just
opened a technical school close by his works.
Some time ago Chief Education Director
Tate spoke of American manufacturers who
had helped technical education, and regretted
i hat Australians were so backward in the
matter. This spurred on McKay. He co-
operated with the State in establishing the
Sunshine school, by giving £2OOO and five
acres of land; and betweep them they have
provided accommodation for 200 students,
half in workshops, half in theoretical class-
rooms. Principally, of course, engineering
and iron-work will be taught, with an eye
1 o McKay’s own requirements. But that’s the
right thing. Only a Freetrader would want
silk-spinning to be taught alongside a bud-
ding ironworks.
A FINANCIAL BOOMERANG.
The accumulated surplus on June 30 was £2,653,223.
Of this amount, £2,457,773 has been invested in
loans to States and otherwise. The Treasurer (John
Forrest) regards this as unfortunate. It ought to
have been foreseen that the amount would soon be
required. —Report of Commonwealth Budget speech.
RELIEVING MANAGER: “What's the matter,
John ? ”
RELIEVING TELLER: “Why, how we battled
to secure the suspension of Fisher and his
staff on the grounds of improvidence and
extravagance! And now Pm hanged if
they didn't carefully invest everything and
hardly left a penny for us to play with ! ”
“J.B.S.’s” snort of indignation:—
“So that the effect of the entry of our Fleet to
Sydney Harbor may live long in the hearts” of those
who saw it, it was commanded that “steamers should
preserve an impressive silence.” The people, in the
simplicity of their hearts, obeyed. So the traitors
who aimed a blow at Australian Nationalism won!
We wanted to shout; we wanted to express our
feelings; we wanted to welcome the Naval Sons of
Australia. But they got the glassy eye instead. Who
gave that order? We ought to know; they are people
worth firing out.
Occasionally the truth leaks out of Syd-
ney Daily Telegraph. In its issue of
October 10:
Turning to Home Rule, he (Winston Churchill)
said the Tories had grown fretful under their long-
enforced continuance in the minority. They used to
rely on the Lards’ veto, but were now inclined to
induce the King to take sides.
The House of Lard ! Good —and we’ll re-
member it was the Sydney Telegraph that
taught us that word.
The imported expert, ignorant of local
conditions, has fallen in again and dragged
the long-suffering country with him. In this
case it is Merz, who owns to an error in
fixing the Melbourne railway electrification
power-house at Yarraville. The quantity
of water needed at the station for cooling
will be 6i million gallons an hour, from 18
to 20 hours a day—more than is consumed
by Melbourne on the hottest summer day.
To get this supply Merz’s Yarraville station
was too high; so though £12,000 has been
spent on a branch railway, the site has
been abandoned and another chosen on
basaltic rock, with hard clay underlie,
nearer Williamstown. There will have to
be a new connection with the Williamstown
railroad, and it will mean lengthening the
main transmission cable by nearly two
miles.
“Public Servant’s” wail:—
The outing of the Superannuation Bill by the
N. S. Wales Leg. Council was certain. The reason
alleged by the party champions for the opposition was
that the Bill was too important to spring on an
expiring Parliament, and that the Council had not
had sufficient time to discuss it. Maybe; but it’s
a different attitude from that taken up in 1910, when
Wade, as Premier, dumped the Railway Superannua-
tion Bill before the Council just previous to the
elections. That Bill had objections which couldn’t
be urged against the P.S. Superannuation Bill, and
even the party’s press was hostile. But Wade was
up against trouble, and wanted to pass a few vote-
catching measures, just as the other party does now—
or did last week. So the Upper House, deaf to all
protests, boosted the Wade Bill through. But,
then, a “Liberal” Government’s job and pay were
in danger. Which made a difference. It generally
does in the House of Fat.
The daily papers get pretty close to the
truth sometimes; but they mostly shy off
before they get right there. In the House
of Reps, the other evening the Cook Govern-
ment proposed to put another £400,000 on
poor sister Tasmania’s plate, Fisher having
dropped £500,000 there already, whereupon
the Opposition stonewalled, and the daily
paper said: —
It is hardly a matter of much concern to the argu-
ment whether there is a political motive in the second
grant, any more than whether there was in the first.
Politics were no doubt at the bottom of both. They
were at the bottom of the baby bonus; they are
at the bottom of all things that Parliament does,
on the well-known maxim that though Parliament
may do many things that are right, it does not do
them because they are right.
The paper knows quite well, of course, that
party politics is at the bottom of the
wretched business. But, being a good party
paper itself, it merely remarked that “poli-
tics” was responsible, and went on barrack-
ing for the old curse.
The occasional announce-
ments made by certain
N.S.W. State Ministers that
they are full of admiration
of their wild loan policy,
and would spend even more
borrowed money if they
could get, are interesting in
a sense. Seeing that these
Ministers climbed into office
on a promise of reduced bor-
rowing, increased economy,
and the expenditure of loan
money only on works that
would pay full interest and
sinking fund, their attitude
defines them as about the
most shameless gang of
political liars, frauds and
deceivers that ever held
office in Australia. They
don’t even take the trouble
to pretend to political hon-
esty—possibly because they
don’t know that such a thing
exists, or possibly because
they don’t know that it possesses a certain
vaiue.
There was an awful row lately because
some suburban Melbourne mayor—a Labol-
ite, of course—left the toast of “The King”
off the list at a municipal shivoo. Now,
according to public report, the knight
McCaughey has sent along a liberal dona-
tion to a party of men who openly adver-
tise that they are collecting arms and ammu-
nition for the forcible overthrow of the
King’s authority. And McCaughey is a
member of the N.S.W. Legislative Council
as well as a knight. Suppose it had been
the Home Rulers who were collecting arms
and fighting funds and a Labor M.L.C. who
had sent a donation, what would the Legis-
lative Council have to say about it?
THE VERY MAN.
One of the most interesting announcements expected from the State Premier in delivering the Buried
speech is the proposal to create a new Department of Labor and Industry.— Melbourne daily payer.
PERMIER WATT: “I suppose you’ll be wauling this, John"'
John Weary : “My oath , yes! Drop it in the hammock.”
Judging by the contradictory reports of
the Moxham-McGirr mill in the library of
the N.S.W. Assembly last week, it is time
the House Committee got busy. Some of
the brands in the Refreshment Room would
appear to require changing, and the immedi-
ate installation of a proper ring with a
padded floor is urgently necessary. A
library is no place for a fight ; some day
some hon. gentleman will knock out what
brains he has by falling against the corner
of a chair. Also, a stipendiary referee should
be appointed, as, according to some accounts,
for the want of a proper supervisor, there
was on this last occasion talk of “putting
in the boot.” This should be guarded against.
If legislators must fight, let them be so gov-
erned that they do it like decent pugs and
not according to Surry Hills rules. One of
the high warlike parties is said to have fallen
down on his way to battle. Which is also
deplorable. There should be a proper exam-
ination beforehand, to see if the hon. gentle-
men are fit to enter the ring. Later on
there should be another examination to see
if they are fit to remain in Parliament.
Conroy, M.H.R., of the Gab, is forming a
party to. agitate for an extension of the life
of the House of Reps, from three to five
years, to reduce that of the Senate from six
years to five, and. to make the whole Senate
retire simultaneously, so that an absolutely
new Parliament, lock, stock and tube, may
be elected every quinquennium. There
would be points about the idea if the Min-
istry were elective but .imagine the present
Parliament and its weird performances
going on wearily, drearily for five
solid years! In any case, if the two
Houses are to retire simultaneously, and be
simultaneously by the same people,
why have two Houses at sill ?
_ After all,’ why this outburst of indigna-
tion and horror when it is suggested that
one member of the N.S.W. Parliament has
been lining his own pockets at the expense
of the public? Hasn’t every member of the
same party who hopes to get re-elected been
attempting to do it? Hasn’t the whole
crowd been using up time (which costs the
country money) in passing railway and other
bills running into about £14,000,000, knowing
well that the works won’t be started for
months in some cases, years in others, and
not at all-in many? There may have been
corruption in one case; there certainly has
been bribery or attempted bribery in the
other. But what in the single member is a
crime, in a whole crowd is—party politics.
“Y’s” verdict after the fight:—
If Moxham you but heard explain
His resurrection from the floor,
You’d think Jack Johnson back again,
But twice as vain as heretofore.
And if you did not quit and run, ■
But heard McGirr his tale repeat,
You’d think he was the biggest gun
On board the flagship of our Fleet.
One of the most insistent deputations that
have harangued P.M.G. Wynne since he
became a Fused Minister arrived from Caul-
field recently, and urged that that
furiously Liberal suburb’s “private contract”
post office should be abandoned in favor of a
State-managed concern. Thus do the advo-
cates of Private Enterprise pour derision on
their creed, going even so far as to earnestly
declare that the beast isn’t fit to be trusted
with the job of passing out a few postcards
or a parcel or two.
Ex-Treasurer Twaddell, getting a chance
in the N.S.W. Assembly the other evening
to talk about Sydney’s inevitable under-
ground railway, moaned, as might have been
expected, that “it would make the present
tramways to the railway unremunerative.”
No doubt it will. The present tramways
also made the ’buses of old unremuUefative;
but nobody but Twaddell would regard that
as any reason why the ’buses should have
been allowed to run for ever.
Page, M.H.R., in from the saltbush and
the mulga, is brutally frank about Parlia-
mentary morals. Men from his own side,
playing the party game, told the Govern-
ment that it was merely bribing Tasmania
with its bid of another £400,000 for the
Speck’s support. “Rats !” said Mulga Jim ;
“the late Government did not give Tasmania
£500.000 without thinking it was going to
get a quid pro quo.” But it seems an urn
tidy way of doing things. Why not have a
regular auction day, and do the business in
a business-like fashion?
OBSERVATION BY A DESPAIRING
SOUL.
The late Fisher Ministry’s proposals to start a
horse-breeding establishment, meat-freezing works and
other things, to help develop the Northern Territory,
have been turned down by the Cook Administration.
THE LONELY ONE: “Ye gods! The old bottle
and hot even a biscuit to chew between
drinks. ”
In Westralia the jarrah and karri cos. of
the South-West, and the firewood combine of
the Goldfields, are so busy with their axes
that decent-sized trees will soon be rare.
Though the South-West cos. should, according
to agreement, replant all denuded areas, no
Government, not even Scaddan’s, has ever
ventured to suggest to them to keep to the
agreement. Recently in Perth a Forestry
League was formed, with the object of look-
ing after these matters, and it will do a
national service if it insists on the right
thing from the jarrah and karri people, and
hustles for the Kalgoorlie-Esperance rail-
way. The line would mean shortening the
route for Newcastle (N.S.W.) coal to Kal-
goorlie mines, and thus give the trees a
chance.
THE POOR CAPITALIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
S fact which appealed to Sir Stephen Collins was
Fiat there were apparently no poor in Australia.
“ there may be a few poor people in the big cities,”
he said, “but in every large town there are bound
to be a few hangers-on. In the country, however,
'.here is no poverty, no poor, and all that seems to
Ic wanted is more men.” —Daily organ.
No poor the Commonwealth within ?
It is a sad, fantastic tale!
Pray search more closely, and begin
Where strikers sleep against the bale
Upon the wharves, or, on the ground,
Beside the wheels that don’t go round.
Go where the horrid Anarchists
Are clamoring for lower rents,
Or where some other wretch insists
That with a meagre 10 per cent.
The man with money to invest
Should deem himself completely blessed.
Go round the six accursed States,
And note the movements of the crowd
Where Sloth with Socialism mates,
And common workers cry aloud
For distribution, fair and square,
Of products of the earth and air.
Rude agitators sit and rule
Where only men of means should be,
And Caucus minions play the fool
With sacred rights of Property.
The claim’s absurd! No poor? Alas!
What of the capitalistic class?

OLD BLAYNEY RESIDENT FOUND
DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS
BROUGHT GENUINE RELIEF
FROM CONSTIPATION.
“Some twelve years ago,” writes Mr. G.
Bevear, Ogilvie Street. Blayney, “I was a
sufferer from rupture, and as nature needed
some assistance, being more or less consti-
pated, I found nothing so good for genuine
relief as Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, and
I always keep them by me for use. As a fam-
ily remedy I can also recomemnd them. At
Blayney I am a resident for 43 years, and
well known. You can use this testimony.”
Nature often requires a little assistance,
and if this assistance is given at the first in-
dication much distress and suffering may be
averted. Mothers especially should guard
the health of their children, and inculcate
regular habits from infancy.
As a family remedy for costiveness, I)r.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills have a wide repu-
tation. They are mild in their action, caus-
ing neither weakness or sickness, and do not
gripe.
To overcome constipation take from one to
four pills regularly until the bowels move
daily, and are restored to healthy action.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
N.S.W. owners have little truck with
South Aus. “classic’ races, but Vic. owners find them
well worth picking up. The £3OO added to the
Morphettville Plate for two-year-olds was annexed
by E. D. Clarker’s Achenar, and J. N. McArthur’s
Kildalton scraped home in the Derby ( £500) from
the local Devron. (The finish was like that of the
Sydney Derby, but, if possible, closer.) The totali-
sator on this race showed the difference between the
correct mathematical odds and those engineered by
the interested bookmaker. Kidalton, reckoned a cer-
tainty, paid 265. for a pound ticket —10 to 3 on.
What would the man with the Bag offer about a
second favorite in a field of seven? The machine
offered 74 to 1, the others being at 9, 10, 37, 50 and
85 to 1.
“0.K.” : The liose of common sense should
certainly be turned upon those heated citizens who
groan at “Baron” when he wins a race with the Duke.
Did the howlers want Duke Foote to run stiff in
the big handicap at Randwick, or did they expect
him to incur a 101 b. penalty for the longer journey
at Flemington ? Seems to me that the haughty
Baron has them dead beaten when he asks: “Is the
person who backed Duke Foote for the Metropolitan
more entitled to consideration than someone who may
have supported him for the Melbourne Cup?” As a
matter of fact, the horse had been more widely
backed for the Cup than for the Met., and the
scratching of him for the Randwick event delighted
more people than it annoyed.
What a wonderful horse Duke Foote is!
In the recent Spring Meeting at Randwick, the hand-
some brute got away with the Spring Stakes, the
Craven Plate and Randwick Plate. This brings his
list of wins to 12, including a dead heat with Auro-
fodina. and his loot to £14,119, including the £4145
raked in last week and the £958 scooped at Tatter-
sail’s (Chelmsford Stakes) just previously. “J.
Baron” tops the winners with six wins worth £5813.
The only ones to get near him are J. E O’Brien, with
two wins ( £4861) and J. and P. Brun, with the
Metropolitan ( £4264). “K. S. Macleod” won two
races, but they were not so heavilv gilded, and
brought him only £1595. Baillieu Bros., whobagged
the Epsom, got £2465. Altogether, £34,023 was
distributed during the meeting to the struggling
owners. After all, it must have been a pleasant week
for these gentlemen.
♦ * * *
With very few Sydney horses figuring on
the card, Guineas Day, at Caulfield, threw little
light on the Cups question, and even the defeat of
Anna Carlovna in the Stakes was less debated than
the news of Duke Foote’s third victory at Randwick.
The mare’s performance was strikingly inconsistent
with her runaway win on the previous Saturday.
Then she looked as fresh after the event as before
she started. This time she was never near the front,
although she finished a respectable third. Presum-
ably something had happened to Anna Carlovna in
the race to account for her much sweat and fretful
mood when she returned to the birdcage. This was
the second time that Mountain Princess had beaten
the Maoriland mare, and the second time within a
week that Audacity had chased the little black lady
home.
Andelosia is either a better colt than he showed
himself at Randwick, or his opponents in the Caul-
field Guineas were a poor lot, for he beat them very
easily. If, as was stated before the race, the Son of
Fortunatus is only slowly recovering from a wrench
which spoilt his Sydney Derby chance, he may, after
all, prove the best of his year. In the meantime, the
form of the Victorian horses has to be tested by the
full strength of the Sydney onposition. Valido made
hacks of the lighter-weighted locals in the Toorak
Handicap, and Aleconner’s canture of the Epsom on
the previous Saturday looks like a bit of good luck.
Before The Bulletin is published the results of
Wednesday’s racing at Caulfield will have settled the
prevailing doubt as to whether Sea Prince is the Cup
“moral” that rumor has talked about for months
past, or is merely a moderately good animal, with a
had English temper and a false reputation. The
present writer pre-supnoses that Sea Prince has done
well in the Eclipse Stakes, in which case he is
entitled to start a hot favorite for the Caulfield Cup.
Seeing that E. A. Connolly offered last week to take
2 to 1 in thousands that he named the winner in
two tries, it seems a fair thing for a prophet to limit
his outlook to seven probables—say, Aurifer,
Anna Carlovna, Mountain Princess. Offa, Sea
Prince, Uncle Sam and Willow Green. The writer
nrefers Aurifer, Anna and Sea Prince to the others,
but because he reckons that the Maoriland mare is
nuite likely to get away in the front rank and escape
the risks of a jostling race he picks Anna Carlovna.
Apparently the trouble with Audacity
just now is a slightly damaged hoof. When the
handsome gee returned to the birdcage on Saturday,
after putting in a run which was an improvement on
his previous best, tnere was a little blood in the
hollow of bi« lame foot. On Monday he was scratched
for the Caul” "Id Cup, to the great grief of baronet
Clarke and all those punters who had got long shots
about the “good thing.”

A surprising crowd of about 200 men
were discovered on Eight-Hour Day deeply inter-
ested in a cockfight in the bush at Canterbury (Syd-
ney). When the police appeared the crowd melted
with extraordinary rapidity, and the police managed
to capture onlv two spectators. The principals, the
seconds, the timekeepers, referee, judge and promo-
ters all got away. So the police let it out on the
two spectators, whose afternoon’s amusement cost
them £5 each, in default two months. Which shows
that watching a cockfight can be almost as expensive
as listening to a grand-opera.
South Australia’s golf championship was
won again by Tom Cheadle, locally bred —he won it first
when still a schoolboy—from Forbes, a comparatively
new resident. The latter was two up with four to
play, but a succession of amazing long putts gave
the game to Cheadle on the last green. The ladies’
championship went to Mrs. H. L. Rymill (nee Blue),
from Mrs. Maxwell Fowler ( nee Ayers).
Manly (Sydney) “goffers” put up a viru-
lent performance in the inter-club premiership this
season by winning the A, B, and C grades. In fact,
it seemed quite possible that had there been a whole
alphabet of grades, little Manly was capable of swal-
lowing the lot. It was a beautiful, well-polished
clean-up.
* * * *
Owing to a holiday, Sydney’s First-Grade
cricketers were able to crowd the second round into
one week. Gordon, which on Monday had declared at
411 for nine wickets, continued the same high-handed
action, and smashed up Middle Harbor’s first innings
for 127 and then put the follow-on through the mill
for 134. Thus it won by an innings and 150 runs.
Which was decisive. North Sydney, the premier
club, which had not tasted defeat for 14 matches,
came to grief against Petersham, having a deficiency
of 43 runs on the first innings. But for the speed
with which the light faded North would have had a
three-point win scored against it, as Petersham
wanted only 22 to win outright and had seven bats
to do it with. A mighty narrow escape for the cham-
pion club. The same thing happened with University
and Paddington. The latter had replied to Uni.’s
327 with a miserable 96, and still had 105 long,
weary minutes to keep its wickets up if it wanted to
stave off an outright win. Uni. played desperately
to wipe out the whole side, but when the day fell
dead Paddington had still four wickets standing, hav-
ing made 115 runs for six wickets. So Uni. got the
verdict on the first innings by 231 runs. Balmain
smacked up 278 in the first innings to Sydney’s 133,
and won by 145. The feature of this match was the
marvellous display by veteran Folkard. He had smit-
ten 101 on Monday, and on Saturday, in Sydney’s
first .innings, he took seven wickets for 81 runs. His
total performance that afternoon was 10 wickets for
128. Sydney had made 105 for five wickets in the
second innings when light failed. Waverley made
only 124 in its first stand against Central Cumber-
land, which smacked up 271 for seven wickets, and
then sent Waverley to the sticks again. The effort
to send it to the woods for a three-point win failed
utterly, as the Funereal Suburb had lost only seven
wickets (for 228) when the curtain fell. So C.C.
had to be content with a first-innings’ victory by 147.
Western Suburbs smacked 370, and Redfern replied
with 318 for seven sticks, so the game ended in a
draw. Two centuries graced the afternoon, Rix, of
Redfern, smiting 135 his side badly needed, and E. L.
Waddy, of Central Cumberland (Parramatta), com-
pleting his little lot at 131. Grace, of Waverley, hit
75; Gee, of Middle Harbor, 58 and 71; and Norris,
of Petersham, 70. Among the bowlers the lion was
T. J. E. Andrews, of Petersham, who took 11 wickets
for 144 runs in the match, Saturday’s contribution
being six for 66. Next came Folkard, of Balmain,
with 10 for 128 (seven for 81 and four for 47) ;
Bowden, of Gordon, seven for 58 (six for 38 and one
for 20) ; Stack, of University, six for 45 (five for
25 and one for 20) : Massie, of University also, six for
62 (four for 43 and two for 19) ; and Maclean, of
Gordon, six for 59.
PRAYING-PUG SUMMERS DEFEATS
CROUCHING BVERNDEN.
For verily, brethren , it is the straight left
and the blessed right that giveth the victory.
Melbourne’s club cricket, the first round
of which concluded on Saturday, promises to be live-
lier this season than for some years past. Already
the century list has started, Cheswass, of ’Cote, carried
his bat for 117 ; Seward, of Carlton, biffed 125 ; and
Baring, of East, 118. Per contra, teams that parti-
cularly wanted to make a large score failed miser-
ably. Collingwood, the premier club, was set the
task of beating Richmond’s 208, and only just man-
aged it with 217. Still, it managed it. Similarly,
’Roy, runner-up last season, being faced with St.
Hilda’s distinctly moderate 163, with difficulty
snatched up 43 and had to follow on, losing ulti-
mately on the first innings by 120 runs. NOrthcote
put together a satisfactory 342 for six wickets, then
declared —and almost fell in, the Easterns piling up
339 runs. ’Cote deserved to win for its pluck. Carl-
ton declared with eight down for 277, a score which
Essendon could have equalled if it had got a move
on ; but the tired feeling encompassed it, and 176 for
eight wickets was the total. South ran up 312 runs
and left P’ran barely sufficient time to catch them, the
ultimate tale of the latter being 186 for five sticks.
The Melb.-’Varsity match didn’t count,, and was only
notable in that W. Armstrong scored 5 and Ransford
99. The only bowlers to push themselves into pro-
minence were youngsters Morrison and left-hander
Moule, of St. Kilda. with four for 21 and three for
18 respectively ; and Mackay, of Richmond, with five
for 71.

The long-drawn-out struggle for the out-
ward and visible sign of the Soccer football cham-
pionship of N.S.W., the Gardiner Challenge Cup,
came to an end on Saturday, when Annandale came
up against Newtown in snlendid fettle. The heat
was stifling, the ground hard as rock, and the struggle
grim. It is doubtful if Newtown ever had a chance,
being outplayed and outgeneralled right through. But
whatever chance it ever had was absolutely thrown
away by the illegal play of over-anxious ’bailers.
The combination, the temperate order and the high
speed of Apnandale were invincible, and its kicking
was deadly. Newtown was overthrown and stamped
flat by three goals to nil—a very decisive win in this
branch of hoofball. A tremendous crowd of Soccer
enthusiasts rolled up to watch the final struggle.’

At time of writing the Coburg Cycling
Club (Vic.) is leading in the Dunlop 100-miles Relay
Desnatch Test, with 4hr. 35min. 13sec. It was run
very close lately bv the Bathurst Club, which did the
distance in 4hr. 40min„ 22sec, The members of both
teams have won the medallions for riding the 100
miles in under the five hours. A notable thing about
the Bathurst club was that the average age of the 10
riders was 18 years. The end of this month will see
the allocation of the £lO special prize for the in-
terim advantage, so there should be some tall riding
during the next few weeks.
Those two apparently invincible English
cyclists, W. J. Bailey and Leon Meredith, have won
the amateur world championships again. Bailey
took the sprint race and Meredith the 100 kilometres
(62 i miles), at the Berlin Stadium, Germany. The
100 kiloms. is a motor-paced championship. Meredith
led from the start, and won easily with over a mile
to spare from Beyer, of Germany, and Blekemolon, of
Holland, covering the distance in lhr. 27min. 58sec. The
Frenchman, Fossier, who was a hot favorite in some
quarters, was quite out of it. The professional cham-
pionships were decided at the same meeting and over
the same course. Walter Rutt, who was here in the
days when Sydney Thousands glittered, won the sprint
premiership of the world, while the long-distance
event went to P. Guignard, since dead. A. H. Shep-
herd, the Australian, did not compete, owing to the
death of his child.
If the toiling backbone of the country
during the next few weeks should hear hymns of joy
ascending from the motor-cars that speed by, he need
have no fear. It will be merely the road hog express-
ing his joy over an announcement that the price of
Dunlop tyres is to be, or has been, substantially re-
duced, as the result of improvements in manufac-
turing methods.

A motor-cycle meeting at the Melbourne
Sports Ground on Saturday afternoon turned out
more or less disastrously. In the Dunlop Scratch
Race Mapleston’s machine skidded on the greasy
track, and the rider found himself lying prone with
a dislocated shoulder. That was bad enough, but
in the Dunlop Handicap McColl’s belt came off ; his
machine wobbled, and crashed into a fence at 50
miles an hour. McGoll’s head struck the post and
he was taken to the hospital in a serious condition,
insensible, and suffering from concussion and other
injuries.
The mermen and maidens of Sydney were
abroad on Saturday when the swimming season was
formally opened by the North Sydney Club’s handicap
at Lavender Bay baths. The race, spread over two
heats and a final, was won by E. C. Cox, with the
Wright Brothers a dead heat for second place. The
day was ideal —and so were the attendances at all the
baths. In fact, in some places there were more
bathers than there was bath accommodation; for,
owing to the encouragement given to the practice of
swimming by the Education Department, the rising
generation in the Ma Capital threatens to become
amphibious. Australia has done well at swimming,
though, as pointed out by Cecil Healy, it is the only
sport—barring, perhaps, ping-pong—that has not had
interest in it fostered by the visits of foreign expo-
nents. But one such is to drop in early next year—
to wit, Duke Kahanamoku, the Hawaiian, who is so
mighty a swimmer that he recently beat an octopus
in a stand-up fight in the ocean. The impending visit
has driven most of the top-notchers into training
before their time this year, and already quite a crowd
of young men are hard at work, and all in splendid
fettle, to qualify for a chance to measure themselves
against this truly wonderful swimmer.
After much thought aud wrestling in
prayer, the N.S.W. Baseball Association declined to
allow the affiliation of the Limited Liability Co. that
proposes to run the Summer competition. Unfortu-
nately, it seems that the Association has no power
to disqualify or otherwise prevent members of its
clubs playing for the co. So on Saturday the lat-
ter started its competitions at the Agricultural
Ground, and pitted Leichhardt against the Waverley
Red Sox and Petersham against the Waverley Blue
Sox. Waverley won both games, Leichhardt being
downed by 23 to 10, and Petersham by 22 to seven.
As a regatta, Henley-on-Parramatta was
very pleasant and successful on Saturday; but as
Henley it was an utter failure. In pomp, social
tone and “boiled dog” in general, it failed to come
up to within seven miles of even Henley-on-Yarra.
But the management worked hard, and, by means of
the short-courses system of racing, provided a finish
about every 10 minutes or so. The afternoon was
perfect, and the racing spiced with excite-
ment. The finish of the Maiden Eights
was a very stern fight between Sydney and Glebe.
Sydney got its nose in front, and, though the boats
were together right to the finish, Glebe could never
recover that lost nose, and finished two
lengths behind. That sort of race is always worth
watching. For the Champion Fours no less than five
crews entered—Leichhardt Nos. 1 and 2, Balmain,
Enterprise and Sydney. The difficult task of starting
them was well negotiated. After a strenuous struggle
Leichhardt No. 1 got about a length in front of
Enterprise. Half-way down Enterprise and Balmain
were making desperate attempts to overtake Leich-
hardt No. 1, and away to perdition in the rear
Sydney was chasing Leichhardt No. 2. Balmain
closed up on Enterprise and they both gained slightly
on slippery Leichhardt. Then Balmain spurted past
Enterprise, but failed to get closer than half a
length to Leichhardt, that crew swinging along
quite unperturbed. And so they finished.
Boxing is now quite a polite profession.
When Jonel Sullivan blazed like a bonfire in the
United States, it was necessary to take elaborate
precautions that “the men” shouldn’t meet. If they
did the furniture was liable to get damaged, and the
peacemakers marked. But on Saturday night, after
the scrap, Evernden presented Summers with his
gloves as a souvenir of the other’s victory, and later
on the two drank sodawater in the managerial office,
and Summers examined the gashed eye of Evernden
with a brotherly interest.
Gladiator James Sullivan, who so mys-
teriously disappeared previous to a fight in Melbourne,
has returned to the fold, and next Saturday night will
meet Jerry Jerome in the place where the latter made
such an amazing stand against Pat Bradley and
broke his hand on the latter’s head. It speaks won-
ders for the recuperative powers of this 44-year-old
darkie that he is able to meet such an opponent in
so short a time. Sullivan, it will be remembered,
was once middleweight champion of England.
The much-discussed meeting of the Eng-
lish welter-weights, Arthur Evernden and Johnny
Summers, took place at Sydney Stadium on Saturday
night, in the presence of over 20,000 men, most of
them roaring with excitement. Summers is t h P
welter-weight champion of England, and i n th P 1
of his birth had already scored a victory over
youth with the mighty wallop. But it was argued
that at .13 Summers was getting no younger am!
Evernden, at about 26, had not got old so fast n
the other hand, there was a firm conviction thal if
the battle lasted 20 rounds it would go to Summed
on points ; for not one in a score would have it (hat
Summers could knock the long-lipped warrior out
On the other hand, no one doubted the ability if
Evernden, provided he could deliver the wallop at
the right address, to put Summers among the poppies
Summers weighed lOst. 3ilb. to Evernden’s lOst
641 b. About a week before he weighed in (or out!
Evernden went list. 81b., and it is quite posible that
the shedding of so much tissue in so brief a time
may have affected his stamina.
At the sound of the gong Evernden attacked with
the cold, temperate fury of a steam-roller. He bored
right in, and Summers met him with quick stabbing
lefts that baulked his attack and disconcerted him
badly. That stabbing left spoilt Evernden’s timing
and caused his sleep-laden swings to go wild; and
when they did go straight to the mark, Summers
shifted that object with some of the smartest ducking
ever seen in the Stadium. It saved him again and
again, and Evernden had the mortification of seeing
absolutely decisive blows miss by—just enough. Sum-
mers was magnificent, and the way he stood in and
mixed it with his gritty opponent, anticipating his
blows with counters that got home first, and swing-
ing three and four rights and lefts to the head and
neck before Evernden could let one go, made the
conqueror of Picato and Burns look as slow as a
beetle. In the fifth round their heads crashed toge-
ther, and Evernden reeled back with the blood trick-
ling in a fast-running stream from a bad cut over
the right eye. Even that terrific smash did not
seem to affect him just then, and he bounded at
Summers like a tiger and shook him badly. But Sum-
mers came through. In the sixth, Summers cut
loose, in an amazing manner, with right and left
swings, hurling in the full force of his body. Evern-
den placed his hands over his jaws and took the
blizzard stoically. Towards the end Summers charged
him, but was met with a heavy counter that all but
sent the champion down. On the way back to his
chair Summers touched his sock-hidden scapular three
times and repeated the operation so often in his corner
that his attendants had difficulty in getting him
ready. In the seventh, Evernden became very aggres-
sive, and showered a quick succession of blows, any
one of which would have dazed an elephant; and
Summers dodged them all or smothered the attack
with a quick clinch. Summers’s mouth was bleeding,
and his left eye was cut, but that ghastly gash in
Evernden’s cheek simply welled blood, and Summers
bashed it unmercifully. It was after the 10th that
Johnny began to take dopes from a colorless medi-
cine bottle, which was said to contain holy water.
He had followed up every repulse in splendid style
and landed about four blows to every one he had
received, and still Evernden seemed unshaken. Sum-
mers still had to duck blows which would have
knocked his head clean over the gasometer, and,
strong as he was, the champion was beginning to
feel the strain. Compared with the other’s celerity
in side-stepping and back-stepping and duck-
ing and getting in his blows, Evernden was
deadly slow. He wasted valuable seconds
waiting for an opening which was never
given, and every time Summers would anticipate the
attack. Had Evernden been as quick as Summers he
would have knocked the latter out half a dozen times
while the young man brushed his hair with his
glove. But*he wasn’t; and as the fight went raging
on, Evernden’s strength began to ebb. His blows at
close-quarters lost their sting, and it became evident
that he was done. Summers might have gone for a
knock-out, but he didn’t; whether it was from caution
or chivalry no man knoweth. In the 18th he closed in
and swung a heavy bash to Evernden’s diaphragm
which caused him to emit a loud yell. After that,
Evernden was done. Though he raged somewhat in
the last two rounds he had ceased to be dangerous;
and at the end of the term the hand of the referee
descended gracefully on the sanctified head of Sum-
mers amidst thunders of applause.
* * * *
The struggling N.S.W. Government, which
is skipping round so nimbly in pursuit of the
elusive shilling, should seriously consider the Tote.
In little Maoriland last year no less than £3,600,000
hurtled through the machine, an increase of
£1,766.132 in five years. How much money do the
bookmakers take out of the pockets of the N.S.W.
public every year? It must be an enormous sum.
Anyhow, it is a certainty that by permitting the
depredations of the penciller, the State Govern-
ment not only fails to protect the best interests of
the public, but loses money on a large scale.

4 Billy T.”: Circumstances alter advertisements.
The Quinlan Opera Co. was in Johannesburg at the
time of the July riots; but since their arrival in
Australia the members have been conspicuously reti-
cent on this subject. What makes their silence the
more clamorous is the fact that when the horror of
the abomination they saw in Jo’berg on the two
most fatal days was strongest upon them, a few of
the pros, wrote letters to England in almost hysterical
condemnation of the soldiers and the police, stigma-
tising the frequent shootings as “cold-blooded
murder.” London Daily Herald published a couple
of these letters ; but no Australian paper has yet been
prodded by any press agent into reprinting them,
although any old, unimportant item concerning the
color of the tenor’s socks is eagerly seized upon.
“Stargazer”: The curious unreality of American
fiction attaches to the American play. Both are un-
commonly clever, both have frequent features that
are human and convincing, but neither is really con-
vincing. The obtruding artificiality destroys the
general effect. The same sensation of wrongness
stands out in all the recent Uncle Sam dramas seen
in Australia, yet one finds it hard to put a finger
on the feature or features responsible for the artistic
failure. Probably the Yankee writer’s affection for
verbal smartness causes much of the mischief. His
characters are all smart in the same way, and their
flippancy is very cloying. When they cease being
flippant, their pathos is turgid by contrast. Per-
haps Americans are like that.
“Petramos”: An Australian syndicate threatens to
import sundry cinematograph celebrities, including
John Bunny and Maurice Costello, of the Yitagraph
Co., and Max Linder, of Pathe Bros. Costello, by the
way, i? boomed by the Vitagraph people as an ex-
Australian stockman. Linder, the French comedian,
made his first big vaudeville hit in Berlin. The
comedy, “The Pedicure,” in which present writer saw
him, was notable for its opening. When Linder was
due at the Wintergarten the manager appeared and
stated that the engagement was the most expensive,
etc., etc. Two minutes later he reappeared to say
that the comedian had not arrived at the theatre,
and craved the audience’s indulgence. The orchestra
played a brief selection. A telephone was (natu-
rally) attached to a wall of the theatre, and the
manager, again appearing, stated that, as Linder
was still absent, he would ring up his apartments.
Immediately he rang a moving-picture was switched
on, showing Linder in bed and reaching for the tele-
phone receiver. The manager informed him that
the audience at the Wintergarten was waiting, where-
at the picture-Linder made a hurried toilet and had
an amazing number of adventures in his rush to
meet his engagement. Eventually he got aboard an
airship, which sailed over the Wintergarten. There,
of course, he fell out of it in the good old flicker -
scopic way. The moment he reached the roof the
celluloid Linder vanished, bricks and mortar tumbled
from above, and in the midst of them came the real
Linder.
“Rosna” (London): An early and cheerful item
of the “Proms,” which have begun to cram the
Queen’s Hall nightly, was the performance of two
new Percy Grainger orchestral pieces, conducted by
Golden Locks himself. They were “An Irish Tune
from County Derry” and “Shepherds Hey,” and
both of them sent the huge house clamoring for
more. “Shepherds Hey” is an ancient Morris dance
~one of many collected by Cecil Sharp, who one
time was choir-master at the Adelaide Anglican
Cathedral. Since those days Sharp has been hunting
folk-songs in Britain, and from one old dame alone
he is said to have recovered more than a hundred
tunes. The Grainger piano version of “Shepherds
Hey” bears the engaging inscription:—“Shepherds
Hey: Morris Dance, collected by Cecil Sharp. Dished
up for the piano by Percy Grainger.” The inside
is equally colloquial, the performer being requested
to play “fast,” “acidly,” clingingly,” “clangingly,”
“bumpingly,” etc., in plain English instead of mys-
terious Italian. The title page naively informs the
world that the setting “is not suitable to dance
Morris dances to.” The Graingers have let their
house at Chelsea and gone abroad. Percy is to
noises in St. Petersburg, return U< to London for 'n St
GeTmany.^Then^he I ’wilfperhaps'havelime^toluei

That sort of outburst doesn’t seem to get anywhere
hut at least it makes a noise. By the way, I don’t
really think the dreadful thing is a folk-song,
“Androcles and the Lion,” Shaw’s latest effort
shows us the Early Christians in the Roman arena’
The lion, of course, recognises in the chief martvr
the friend who, in the prologue, had extracted the
anchor from his foot. W T hen one of the martvrs is
goaded to fight the gladiators he slays the lot of
them. Caesar thereupon pardons the Christians • but
as the lion has to he fed, Androcles offers himself
Tf 16 h.on pardons Androcles, and, presumably, gives
. m a / ree P ass > good for life, over all the railways
* n Africa. After that, the lion ought to sing a
hymn, but doesn’t. Doubtless he is hoarse. It is an
excellent piece of fooling that has come rather too
* onK after “The Sign of the Cross.”
.The veteran G. R. Sims has got back to the stage
with a “human interest” melodrama, “The Ever
Open Door,” something akin to “Two Little Vaga-
bonds,” “The Christian” and “The Lights of
London.” There are a couple of “waifs,” both, of
course, played by girls. A midnight march of the
Rescue Mission through Westminster slums (which
are some of the worst in London) is a big feature,
Hilda Spong, in the principal grown-up part, made
her firs t London reappearance after her world tour
with “Everywoman.”
“Petramos”: Regarding “The Miracle,” shortly to
be filmed in Australia. Only two cities—London and
Vienna—could stand the expense of the original pro-
duction, the people in which totalled 3000. The
mystic play came to London Olympia, chiefly at the
instigation of one Carre, who as a versatile showman
in a big way beats the whole British band. He for-
merly worked in a circus. Rheinhardt, the producer
was a vaudeville performer. Partly because the prices
were so high, and partly because Olympia’s reputation
was more horsey than churchy, London stayed away
in great numerosity, until the Daily Mail asked the
city where it had hidden its reputation for culture.
Then “The Miracle” grew into a well-merited suc-
cess, and in some mystic way the Mail ultimately
ST°t control of the film, which thus comes to Aus-
tralia via Fleet-street.
“Motley”: May Wirth, niece of Phil and George,
is, at 18, the foremost circus equestrienne in the
world. She is a Queensland native. Her superla-
five ability became evident in Australia, which she
left two years ago. Engaged with Barnum and
Bailey in America, she was the brightest light of
that monster organisation. Now Hagenbeck and
Co. have engaged her as principal star in their im-
mense circus and zoo, to show at Olympia, London,
I remember two supposed lady equestrians who vied
with men, but they both turned out to be men. One
was the famous “Ella” Zovara, and the other was
Ernest Shand, l#iown as “Daisv.” Ella Zoyara was
Omar Kingsley, and when he bewitched Australia
his wife and two children were with him. The
Melbourne Public Library has an outrageously rhe-
torical and unreliable biographv of “Ella” Zoyara,
written by a certain (or uncertain) Walker, known as
Tom Cringle. Years after he had left off being a
circus lady Kingsley revisited Australia as a ring-
master.


"THE CAR WITH A CONSCIENCE”

1 P< )Sltlon of builders of exclusive high-grade cars, the Oakland Motor Car Co. have

tiac e. I his year they announced the Model 35 Small Car —a strictly high-grade car in
miniature a product acknowledging no competition ; not a cheap car at all —far from it.
It is piobabh the most silent, most modern, the most elegantly equipped car ever sold
under in Australia.

The Inky Way.
Dead, in South Africa, as the result of a buggy
accident, W. H. Milton, lightweight boxer, racehorse
owner and good sportsman generally, who was sport-
ing editor of the Kalgoorlie Miner for nearly 10
years. He was one of the first men who left Sydney
for the Westralian goldfield, and (to his credit or
otherwise) was the introducer of whippet-racing
there. He had been in Africa about two years, and
was at the time of his death judge for the Johannes-
burg Racing Club.
* * * *
Dr. Cleary, R.C. Bishop of Auckland (M.L.), tha
new Coadjutor-Archbishop of Adelaide,' has trav-
elled the Inky Way, having been editor of the
Tablet, the organ of the R'.C.’s in Maoriland. He
was formerly a priest in Ballarat. Archbishop
O’Reily, to whom he coadjutes, has also done a
variety of presswork, in Westralia and elsewhere.
* * * *
“Absalom Jones”: Bert Bailey says he will stake
Dad’s whiskers on the Charles Garvice drama, “Just
a Girl,” which he is to give Australia shortly. Ap-
parently Garvice had never thought of developing
into a dramatic genius till Bailey suggested the
offence. The Australian manager describes Garbage’s
correspondence as “most unassuming.” In England
he is by no means discredited in the best circles. I
recollect a London dinner 1 at which he was the lion.
Other celebrities Were there (Maurice Hewlett among
’em), but they simply weren’t in the menagerie.
Few Australian pressmen who have gone to the
Great Fog to follow the Inky Way have made such
rapid progress as Harry B. Manderson, formerly of
Melb. Aoe. Manderson went to London for the
King's Coronation. An Australian who knew
Dominion politicians was handy at the moment, with
the Imperial Conference just meeting. Manderson
wrote “specials” about Australian politics, with
sketches of Fisher, Pearce and others, and they were
accepted by the Daily Chronicle and Westminster
Gazette and others. He walked past the flunkeys
guarding the Foreign Office, interviewed the Premiers,
and got away with the earliest Conference news, while
the English pressmen were waiting outside the build-
ing. The transport workers, dockers’ and railway
strikes were occurring about that time, and the way*
was paved for reliable articles on Australia’s arbi-
tration laws. Manderson, making good on these,
too, was sent by the Chronicle to India for the
Durbar. He brought off a couple of “scoops,” for
which he received a bonus cheque upon his return.
Securing an engagement immediately -as sub-editor
of Lloyd’s Publishing Agency, he was despatched
last year, almost at a moment’s notice, to the West
Indies to write a book, “Twentieth Century Impres-
sions of the West Indies.” The book is In the press,
and the author received word on his 27th birthday
a few months agq that his salary had been raised to
£lOOO a year. Incidentally, he married the daughter
of a United States banker at New Jersey (U.S.A.).
The honeymoon is being spent in Peru, where the
young Australian has, gone to write another “Twen-
tieth Century Impressions” book. Lloyd, of Lloyd’s
Publishing Ageney, is an Australian, who, 12 years
ago, was business manager of the now defunct Perth
Morning Herald. With the dawn of the 20th
century he conceived the idea of writing up places
and people and disposing of handsomely-bound, well-
printed works at a substantial figure to the persons
whose biographical sketches appeared therein. He
started with “Twentieth Century Impressions of
Western Australia,” the literary work being done by
F. Humphries, at one time chief of staff of the
Aoe. Lloyd then went to London, and with his
“Twentieth Century Impressions” of many countries
has been coining money ever since.
The Editor. —Sir, —I have long been perturbed by
the coarse, ungodly tone of your Bulletin, and harve
ever viewed with alarm the possible effects of such a
publication upon the youth and innocence of our
community. However, sin, I am not one to bear
malioe. On the contrary, lam willing to co-operate
with you in a Reform campaign, which will, inci-
dentally, give you an opportunity of demonstrating
the sincerity of your protests that you desire to
uplift humanity. Now, sir, in the August issue of the
Ladies’ Home Journal appeared a pictorial sermon
by the editor. It consisted of a page of snapshots
taken on the various Atlantic beaches, and depicted
the same outrageous goings-on that disfigure our
holiday resorts, only here (alas, that it should be
admitted) to a much more shocking extent. The
central picture is one, alas! only too familiar to
this city. It was a portrait of a hussy in bathing
costume (with skirt so short that it displayed her
stockinged legs), and being embraced by an uenscru-
pulous profligate, also in bathing attire! Both were
facing the camera, smiling and unashamed. There
were many other harrowing scenes, including one of
a group of people lolling about the sands, a mincjled
mass of male and female. (“Sunbaking,” I believe
this is called. “Sin-making,” I call it, sir!) Across
this thrilling pictorial sermon appeared in large black
letters: “How Much of This Would You Like Your
Daughter to Share t” Now, sir, such a series of views
would probably delight t-he class of readers you
cater for But a touching editorial appeal to home-
puritv like that quoted above might turn sueh a
work of evil into an instrument of Righteousness and
an influence for Good! Hence my appeal to you to
go and do likewise. I will help you. Although mere
words cannot describe the emotions that thrilled my
entire being on seeing these things, yet was I so con-
vinced of the efficacy of this form of pictorial sermon
that, should vou accept my offer and decide to pub-
lish something similar. I would undertake the dis-
tasteful task of personally assisting in it. I am
indeed prepared to bear the brunt of the work.
Amongst my flock of converts in this city are several
estimable young ladies, who might be prevailed unon
to co-operate with me, out of sheer kindliness and a
spirit of self-sacrifice. They include Miss Knock.y
Dopeall (domestic duties, Crown-street), the Misses
Maisie Fliekett and Jiggy Dashall (both of whom, I
admit, might have once been met in a well-known
city bar Gy the Religious Editor when on city mission
work), Madam Vere de Vene (masseuse, Darling-
hurst). Birdie Wobblegait (Coogee Surf-Siren Club),
and Miss Spemmedays O’Halloran. late of the
Hotel, Lower George-street). But should the Religious
Editor’s pocket diarv contain the names and addres-
ses of any of his disciples upon whom we oould
positively rely for active assistance in this seheme, I
would offer no objection to all arrangements being
left in his hands. However, I would again emphasise
my readiness to take an active part in the presenta-
tion and preparation of these really excellent pic-
torial sermons; and would urge upon him the neces-
sity of such a good work being taken in hand as im-
mediately as possible.' —Yours anxiouslv. Ephraim

the scratch company.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Scotch comedians had come
To make a stir in Brumby Town.
With skirl of pipe and beat of drum
They drew the eager people down
from Dingle Hill and Burgoo way
lo hear them singing “Scots wha’ ha'e.’’
They danced in kilts the maids to shock
With show of wild and shaggy shins;
They chorused “Stop Yer Ticklin’, Jock,’’
And told o’ Glaskee’s little sins ;
Then acted in a Highland play,
Which Tavish said was “awfu’ gay.”
The second morn McDougal went
To air his “ain peculiar views”
To Mr. Smith, the writing gent
Who edited the Bkumby News ;
And sore he knocked poor Smith about
Before he cleaned the office out.
“Scratch company!” McDougal roared,
And shook the News in front of Smith-
“ Scratch company, ye things abhorred !
I’ll teach ye who y-s’re dealin’ with.
Ye scurvy, low-lived human botch
To ca’ us scratch because we’re Scotch!”

What Guns Are Offered
At Your Dealer’s?
FOR a horse or a dog, you of course go to the
dealer who is known to stock thoroughbreds*
You have confidence, in his judgment.
So, too, in sporting goods equipment, you may rely
on that dealer who stocks Remington-UMC rifles and
shotguns* That, in a measure, is proof of his being
well-informed.
Remington-UMC repeating rifles and shotguns are the
last word in breech-loading arms construction. The clean,
trim, thoroughbred lines that make them the sportsmen's first
choice are the result of designing which, among other things,
eliminates the protruding hammer and closes the breech.
You should be informed on these and
other important points in modern gun-making.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf or going deaf, you will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them—-
the strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What
a relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural
drum. Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt
the ear. It fits the ori-
fice of the ear with pre-
cision and comfort. The
division that runs across
the mouth is to allow the
removal and insertion of
the Ear-Drum, and to
brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the he a r ing-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
if you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
£>
cured, and you can be cured, too. You inav wght
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you wish. Children can wear them (we
have special sizes for children from six to twelve).
Even a child can insert and remove them without
the least danger.
. f*he price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are only
sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also an
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur-
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., but the
pair you get at first will last quite two years. Do
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send them out
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use the
Order Form below, and the Outfit will be sent you
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t delay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

For the Country Horseman
The saddle here illustrated is expressly designed
for country use, for stock riding, etc., and is built
of the best materials throughout. If any of our
friends are requiring such a saddle they will find
this a genuine bargain.
It has a hogskin seat, a plated bar-tree, extra
long flaps, with points to buckle below. An economi-
cal feature is the skirt, which extends all round
and thus adds years of wear to the saddle by pro-
tecting its interior from the weather. It has a
deep, “sweepy” seat, 4in. kneepads, nickel-plated
iron stirrups, and double buckle leather girth. The
price complete is £3/15/- Mention of The
Bulletin when ordering will ensure your having a
leather surcingle given in free, and the saddle will
be forwarded freight paid. It is to be obtained
from ,J. P. Talty. 388 Sussex Street, Sydney.

HOW TO PREVENT ACID STOMACHS
AND FOOD FERMENTATION.
By a STOMACH SPECIALIST.
As a specialist who has spent many years
in the study and treatment of stomach
troubles, I have been forced to the conclu-
sion that most people who complain of
stomach trouble possess stomachs that are
absolutely ljealthy and normal. The real
trouble, that which causes all the pain and
difficulty/ is acid in the stomach, usually
due to, or aggravated by, food fermentation.
Acid irritates the delicate lining of the
stomach and food fermentation Causes wind,
which distends the stomach abnormally,
causing that full, bloated feeling. Tmus
both acid and fermentation interfere with
and retard the process of digestion. The
stomach is usually healthy and normal, but
irritated almost past endurance by these
foreign elements —acid and wind. In all
such cases—and they comprise over 90 per
cent, of all Stomach difficult : es —the first and
only step necessary is to neutralise the acid
and stop the fermentation by taking in a
little warm or cold water immediately after
eating, half a teaspoonful of b : surated mag-
nesia, which is doubtless the best and only
really effective antacid and food corrective
known. The acid will be neutralised and
the fermentation stopped almost instantly,
and your stomach will at once proceed to
digest the food in a healthy, normal manner.
Be sure to ask your chemist for the bisu-
rated magnesia, as I have found other forms
utterly lacking in its peculiarly valuable
properties.—F.J.G.*

THE BANANA LAND
The Rockhampton end of the northern
coastal line was shoved a little further north
the other day when the bits of steel were
laid as far as Yaamba. Of old, Yaamba,
which is “at the head of navigation of the
Fitzroy waters,” had ideas of becoming a
“seaport” for the western country. In those
days folk climbed up the rivers as far as
they could go with their small craft, and
then sat down to wait for townships to
grow. But, unfortunately for the budding
Yaamba, boats started to grow too, and the
city-to-be shrivelled to nothing. Even Rock-
hampton is miles too far up the river to-
day. When it knew it couldn’t be a sea-
port, Yaamba pined for a railway. After
a delay of a little over 50 years, it has
come, and now there seems nothing what-
ever for Yaamba to live for.
A curious little row is raging in Bris-
bane. Some time ago the Walker whisky
people began to send out their goods in
patent stoppered bottles that are practi-
cally non-refillable. It seemed a good thing
for the hotel-keeper who wants to sell stuff
true to label in his own shop, and therefore
wants to see others do the same in their
shops and thus compete fairly. But, in-
stead of meeting the innovation with three
cheers, the Bung Association met it with
47 curses, and promptly talked of putting
the price of this whisky up to 9d., so as to
knock the non-refillable bottle out. If Bung
were charged something extra for the
special bottle, or if he couldn’t get as much
for it empty as he can for the ordinary
empty bottle, there would be something in
his complaint; but as he isn’t charged any-
thing extra, and as he can get as much for
the special bottle as for the ordinary, the
only conclusion the public can come to is
that Bung doesn’t like the patent-stoppered
bottle because it isn't refillable. And if
that is a reflection on Bung, Bung has only
himself to thank for it; and if he persists
in his objection, be will deserve all the re-
flection that he will certainly get.
Passed out, the other day, in the Gympie
Hospital, James Nash, the discoverer of the
goldfield which he stuck to to the last. In
1866 Nash, who had been trying his luck at
Nanango, decided to give it best and shoulder
bluey—and then Gympie blazed forth, and
Queensland lifted its tired head. Within six
months 15,000 miners were pot-holing the
alluvial. Curtis discovered his famous nug-
get of 9750 z., worth £3675. (Curtis didn’t
get much out of it when the lawyers had
cut their costs out. He died in Rockhampton
about four years ago. Which is all another
story.) When the alluvial gave out, the
shallow shafts put in their appearance and
the rich specimens were dollied for their
metal; and soon the stamper batteries fol-
lowed. There were some phenomenal crush-
ings in those days. The Caledonian treated
10 tons for 9980 z.; the Lady Marv bestowed
23200 z. on its owners from 13cwt. Within
five years of its birth Gympie had robbed
£1,500,000 from the pockets of Mother Earth.
Then other things happened. The first floor
of black slate, which carried the gold-bearing
quartz, gave out, and was duly succeeded by
green stone which carried nothing worth
carrying, and the slump hit Gympie hard.
But some of the most financial shows amal-
gamated and started to probe the earth for
a second floor of black slate —and found it
and more gold. Nowadays Gympie spends
most of its time looking for the third and
fourth floors ; but it is getting very worn in
the search. Last year, when Gympie had
produced 2,653,2930 z. of gold, a generous
Government opened its heart and gave Nash
£lO0 —but it doesn’t want the news of this
generosity to get into the papers. The old
man was 79 when he died.
Another “honorable understanding” has
gone wrong. Some time ago the Brisbane
breweries decided to raise the price of beer
to the publicans. Then the publicans put
their heads together and decided to raise the
price to the public. A glass was to be
4d. instead of 3d., and a whole pint
was to be fivepence. But the new prices
had been in force only two d.ays when it
was discovered that trade was slack at most
bars, while a few pumps were running hot
through excess of toil at the old prices. Bung
then realised sadly that a man will walk
much further to save tuppence towards the
next pint than had been supposed.
Bananaland’s metropolitan police have
made a new record for smartness. A few
months ago two cheques were forged and
cashed at Ipswich. Cahill’s men soon smelt
out the forger, and one William Smith was
landed in Boggo-road Gaol. After waiting
for 114 days for trial, he was one day in-
formed that he didn’t forge the cheque, and
with a parting word not to do it again he
was set free. He was the victim of mis-
taken identity, and it took the law only 114
days to find it out.
A fine Australian mother has just gone to
join some of her children—Mrs. Sophie
Corrie. Forty years ago she put her young
brood of six under her wing and went on
the land at Colo Vale. For 30-odd years
she worked the farm herself, and made it a
successful proposition. At the age of 74
she sold out, and, unaccompanied, proceeded
to tour the world. Then looking for a place
to settle down, she decided that Queens-

land gave her the best chance of a long life ;
so she went to Brisbane, and lasted out till
she was 83. Incidentally she wrote a book
or two; but it would take a lot more than
that to hold all her knowledge and wisdom.
“Kobbi” : A deputation asked Digby Den-
ham to consider what a grievous wrong had
been done the-Public Hospitals by depriving
them of the “drunk” fines from the local
courts, the last Licensing Act having found a
new use for them. But Denham has no money
to spare these days, wherefore he asked
whether the deputation didn’t think that a
subsidy of £2 for everv £1 of private sub-
scriptions was a fair thing. As a matter of
fact, it is a lot more than a fair thing so
long as the people who put up the £1 have
all the say in spending the £3. One institu-
tion the writer knows once poured out £157
on a fowlhouse!
Governor Macgregor confesses to having
once struck a black man. Up in Papua, he
says, he saw a young dude sawing off an
animal’s tail with a blunt knife. Pie did
not attempt to reason with the butcher, but
gave him a clip on the ear. “Humanitarian
impulse prompted the blow,” says the public,
of course. Not at all —merely trade rivalry.

the thins: done in a bungling fashion.

It brought again the Joys of Earth, the Sin,
And drove afar the ghostly Night’s Ideal.

How this poor Life was but a shadowy

And in the actual daylight I may learn
Its ioys were but the phantoms of a

Brisbane, October 11, 1913.
My Dear Tiiargomindah,—
Governor Macgregor is glumly inspecting
the prickly-pear pest at Dulacca; Lady
Macgregor is busy supporting a f§te in aid
of the Ministering Children’s League; and
the Vision returned yesterday from Belle
Vue, where she has been sojourning under
the hospitable roof of Mrs. Lumley Hill.
That is the vice-regal roster for the week.
The Nudgee College Boys’ concert on
Wednesday was a huge success. The Cen-
tennial Hall bulged with sisters, cousins,
aunts and the rest of the family; also his
Ex., Lady Macgregor, Judge Real, Ted
Real the aide, and a few professors. Lady
Macgregor was handed a big bunch of red
and white roses by a bashful youth, and the
audience (with its feet) helped a fledgling
orchestra to play Irish airs. The item of
the evening was “The Miser,” written by
Mr. Moliere, and wrestled manfully with by
the boys, who pulled through much better
than the average school actor usually does.
Henry Alcock, M.A., of Magdalen Col-
lege. Oxford, has been appointed lecturer
in Hislorv and Economics to the Queens-
land University. At Magdalen he won
three exhibitions, and gained honorable men-
tion for the Stanhope historical prize essay
in 1907. He has also studied in France
and Germany, and has been master at Tet-
tenhall College, in Staffordshire, and at
Kendal Grammar School.
Dr. Hopkins came back last Monday by
the Shropshire. He looks quite well again
and years vounger. While he was away he
attended the International Medical Con-
gress in the city of Big Smoke, and saw
George V. bricklaying on the foundation job
of the Commonwealth building in London.
By the way, George is the most expensive
bricklayer in England.
Mrs. W. IT. Walsh, mother of A. D.
Walsh of Dalgety’s, and of Western Walsh,
died in Toowoomba this week. She was
one of the founders of the Governesses’
Home, and was also intimately connected
with most of the Brisbane charitable organi-
sations. Unlike most other charity workers,
she disliked publicity, so the greater part
of her work was done without the clamor
of press paragraphs. She was a handsome
old lady and a gentlewoman of the old
school, w T hich went down before the rush of
the school for scandal, and the woman’s
frights school, and the X-ray skirt school
and a few other modern acadamies for de-
preciating femininity, my dear.
On Thursday morning a deputation of
women boxed up the Minister for Lands,
and demanded a piece of the ancient Pad-
dington cemetery as a playground for chil-
dren. Minister Tolmie promised, so a play-
ground and a kindergarten will soon hang
out its shingle on the site of old Skeleton
Park.
Mrs. Kingsbury added another presenta-
tion to her already lavish supply on
Wednesday afternoon. She has resigned
the presidency of the Industrial Home „
the committee coaxed her to the hniia:.
with suggestions of afternoon tea and nT g
handed her a silver fruit repSto“ “ !
spoons and other paraphernalia for attaek
ing the reposing vegetables. The
lady seemed to like the utensils very
and the committee appeared equally nl easPf ,’
to give them to her, so things were on the
level and harmony prevailed fore and aft
On Wednesday afternoon three of
girl-musicians—Gladys Frost, Lena Ham
mond and Lucy Baker—gave a mating
musicale at Paling’s. The room is no? lar ee
and it was packed long before the serious
work of the afternoon began. The exaei
quality of the musical goods supplied mav
be suspected when I tell you that, save for
one or two soulless individuals, the late
comers, who had to stand on the mat re
mained there till the end.
Artist and writer Isabel Townley leaves
for Ceylon next week. She is travelling
with the rich Miss Cory, of Toowoomba
Ihe two are old pals, and as Isabel has done
the trip before, they will not need anv
guides or other useless luxuries. J
Singer Lottie Richter Davis and her hus
band are visiting Sydney, travelling down
by motor.
Dalgety’s staff held its annual outing on
Monday afternoon in the presence of its
best girl, a brass band and some superior
kinds of food, etc. I’m not a judge of the
etc., but the rest of the appurtenances was
uncommonly cheering.
The outback parson needs to have a sense
of humor. One was conversing to an audi-
ence of cockies, and he chose the Gadarene
swine for the meat of his discourse. One
old man, who had listened attentively, sud-
denly broke in with great emphasis, “But
what I want to know is, who paid for them
pigs t”
Stone, the aviator and jockey of the
clouds, again essayed to fly at Ascot to-day.
He did not attract rain, but the rest of his
ill-luck still pursued him. When getting a
start a limb of the air-horse was sprained
or bent or hamstrung, and the animal
promptly went on strike and refused to
skychase again. Young Jones circled round
about eight times, at the rate of 40 miles
an hour or thereabouts, but the race that
the public had paid to see did not come off.
This is the third disappointment, and
presently somebody will get annoyed.
Captain G. A. Richard, who for many
years managed Mount Morgan and made mil-
lionaires, has been doing some air-sailing in
one of the Zeppelin craft. The party
set out from Potsdam, and. after circling
about Berlin, finished a 100-mile tour by
returning to the starting-point, r Miss
Richard was with dad, and has recently
dropped to Rockhampton the postcard she
wrote when the wind was howling through
her tresses. The other Australians who
made this trip were Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs, of
a Brisbane legal firm, and Vance Jones.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
One of Bananaland’s itinerant teachers, P.
Jensen, has to scuttle round a district of
25,000 square miles in the course of
12 months, and the annual report

three times a year.” What is the Depart-

way matters (B. 25/9/’l3) leaks at every
joint. Commissioner Evans did not import
the McKeen auto-motor cars; the contract
was made prior to his appointment. When
the first car was put together and weighed,
Evans found that it was 2 tons 9cwt. over
the axle load at the driving end; and seeing
that an 8-ton axle load was specified for,
this overload rendered the cars useless for
light lines, so the Commissioner very rightly
refused to accept them in that state. The
co.’s representative then reduced the weight
on the leading end, bringing it down to the
specified axle load, and cars so fitted are
being accepted, one at a time, after com-
pleting the 500-mile test. Evans has cer-
tainly not developed the importing craze;
and as to his being kind to the foreign con-
tractor —well, ask Beard, the McKeen Com-
nany’s Brisbane representative, what he
thinks about it

Bottle=fed
Babies
How often little, bottle-fed
babies suffer from weak-
ness, anaemia, rickets and
teething troubles. Yet a
little SCOTT’S Emulsion,
added to the contents of
the bottle, will build up
the weakest child, will en-
rich the blood, renew the
strength and make that
child healthy, sturdy and
strong ; and, at t~e same
time, genuine SCOTT’S
will strengthen the lungs
to resist coughs, colds, bron-
chitis, and all throat and
chest ailments. Start baby
on SCOTT’S to-day—but be
sure to get SCOTT’S with
the fishman on the package.

Tom Noddy: Hell begins to bulge witb
sub-editors who get there through cursing at con-
tributors for jambing their type-written lines so
close together that the slimmest pencil can’t squeeze
in between.... Don Gaspar: Right off our beat....
Ormiston: At the time when the Spanish Armada
tried to do things, the British ships were painted
any old color. Of 201 vessels only 50 were Govern-
ment craft —the rest belonged to buccaneers, pirates
and other maritime bushrangers, and there was but
a single rule under Heaven that applied to the lot
of them. Any modern commission agent will tell
you what that rule was. .. . Longworth: Sorry, but
can’t oblige you with any remedy for falling hair.
You might try glue, but we don’t recommend it....
J.8.H.: No copies now available. .. .Rusty Cuss: It’s
all of it vigorous. But there’s a lot of it impos-
sible and your ear for rhyme wants sharpening. Still
here goes for a bit of plain talk: —
In winter time I waded through the mud
And drove the cows, still chewing at the cud,
Through filthy yards that stank of rank manure,
To dirty bails that fire alone could cure.
They waded to their bellies in the slush,
Each step a stinking geyser that did gush,
Like Waimunga a-scattering spray that spread
In spots o’er all the beast from tail to head.
The milk’s pulled out from foul and grimy udders,
Yet senseless parents watch their children’s shudders
As stricken through this milk by dire disease,
And pray “God's will be done, if so He please.”
Try some more... .West WTnd: It sounds like a fact.
Nothing has a worse habit of being old and un-
original... .Dohori: You ought to have good copy
up there, but leave room between the typed lines for
at least one pen to have a look in... . Don Q.: Re-
ceived copy of William H. Hayne’s “Star” poem in
Scribner’s Magazine; also, suggestion that it should
be reprinted on the Red Page. We read the first
verse
IN THE HEART OF THE SWAMP.
Couched in the dense cane brake,
The tropic-hearted snake
Lies in a coil of inert fire,
Drowsed by the midday and the insect choir;
Yet draw not near or you shall hear
The deadly twang
Of his awakened fang.
And, remembering the sheer drop of 60ft. from the
window of the Red Page room into George-street it
was decided to take no risks. The Red Page man
is a cross between a scalded devil and a circular
saw when thoroughly roused, and “the deadly twang
of his” (the tropic-hearted snake’s) “awakened
fang” would merely be calling tenders for the worst
... . Barabbas: Note from you to say that “when the
epidermis swells with vinous effulgence I become
metamorphosed. A bigger, ranting, canting, unctuous,
cadging, non-conformist rotter of a malignant type
never existed.” As one gentleman to another we’re
bound to take your word.... Mint: Not enough snap
in it for that kind of thing—-just about the hardest
kind of thing for a young ’un at the business to
attempt.... McHugh Asbestos (or something simi-
lar) : Your article on “the old sod” (or, again, it
might be “the bold cod” or “the cold dog”) is the
most illegible we have had for three months. It i s
so far as the office handwriting expert can judge,
exclusively about England. There are five references
to “colonials,” meaning Australians, and about 60
erasures. At the finish it appears to go quite mad,
as witness this sentence:—
A bustling Agriculture. Prosperous fields. Recla-
mation, —Roots, —1 say Sugar Beets, Grain.—Farms
farmed ! In good-heart!
Alive. —
Full, overflowing.—
Pedigree-stocked, and —Cultivated !
It’s lucky you’re Asbestos, considering the place
we’ve consigned you to. . . .W.E.: Stygian darkness
pervades the office so far as the article which you
mention is concerned. Blame it on to some other
paper. .. .Jerry : The only man we know who delves
deeply into that question is very ill at present with
a beast in his feet —and the name thereof is gout.
Will ask him for the facts when he gets better—if
we don’t forget, or elope, or chance to be run in, or
something... .A.C.: Poverty makes us acquainted
with strange dead fellows. The man you inquire
about passed out some years ago in a public institu-
tion, and was buried in premises adjacent. . . .Ulster-
ite: You are a bad guesser. All the articles you
enumerate were written by the editor himself, and
he admits being born in Glasgow, and having had a
Presbyterian upbringing. There is one man on the
staff whose name begins with O’, but, curiously
enough, he has never touched that subject or shown
the slightest interest in it. He specialises in fiction
and verse. And the sub-editor of Irish descent
whose name doesn’t begin with O’ only gets really
excited when writing on the absurdity of Party Gov-
ernment or the cussedness of Trusts. .. .Nemo: “If
an irresistible force should meet an immovable object,
what would be the result?” It would go into the
waste-paper basket... .M.R.: Story unsuitable....
Bried Dliu: No value here. You might place them
with another paper. . . .A.O’D.: MS. returned. Can-
not reply by letter. Story too conventional....
Bellerive: Room for a condensed romance: —
FOR THE LOVE OF A LADY.
Lady Esther’s more precious
To me than gold,
Exclaimed a young gallant
To a rival bold.
High words.arose over
The lady fair,
Aroused were the rivals
To furious despair.
Prepared for combat
Their swords they drew
And a duel between ’em
Did grimly ensue.
Fierce passes were exchanged
Tragic ended the fray,
Mortally wounded the
Illfated one Lay.
....John B.: It isn’t a good rhymed advt. for the
unknown land... .D.M.: The story of Jack T. isn’t
very interesting as you tell it.... Stick: You’ve
squandered paper and ink... .Woonga: Too slight... .
The Kid: One is a mildly monotonous devil rhyme,
the other a sort of gallop round one of the old stock
ideas... .S.E.N.: Sorry unsuitable.... Wuk W.: Mor-
alising rhyme rather du11... .A.8.C.: It appears to
be a deserving poem, but we can’t afford to be
charitable... .Boronia: Rather bumpy and quite un-
original. ... Dervish : You rise late for a bugler....
J.E.8.: Mildly humorous. Not enough in it for
B. ....Ralph T.: Desist. .. .W.K.F.: Sorry “Weed”
is below acceptance level. .. .8.M.: Don’t require
“His Requirements.” It is a poem that hurries
along and only half explains itself... .E.M.H.: Blow
the mirror of nature! Bust the little birds ! Dash
the hen-borrowing rhyme!... .G.E.B. (M.L.) : Go
and sing it. It is too idiotic to be read.... W.8.L.:
The bush poem was condemned and you were duly
notified in this column. “Death” and “Life” are
hereby condemned in their turn. .. .G.J.H.: Fairly
thin verse.... Beery C.: No head on it....M.W.
(Sydney): Nothing in batch worth our while....
A.M.R.: “The Bush Inn” is a solemn, dingy, grey-
bearded, toothless poem on the old English model.
Dost see yonder basket?... .J.A.C.: Manuscript en-
tombed... .H. 8.: You may be a patriot: .you are no
poet.... Stranger: Plain bush rhymes. Don’t look
for them in print... .S.J.H. (V.): “Star” may do.
Others much inferior to it.

Our experiment of a couple
of years ago, of taking the
wholesale catalogues of the
great English (Manufacturers
of electro silver and solid sil-
ver goods, and deducting 20
per cent., or 4/- in the £,
from their prices, was of a
revolutionary character, and
might have landed us in heavy
loss, but
IT DID NOT,
owing to our great output,
and so we are continuing the

Started with Pimple, Spread to
Sore. Cuticura Ointment Made
Complete Cure, Hair Thick,
Eden Park, Whittle'sea, Vic.—“l had
suffered for about three months with severe
irritation of the scalp and loss of hair, it
started about the size of a small pimple,
very sore on the top of my head, and I tried
ointment but without success, and it spread
to a sore about the size of the palm of your
hand, and the hair was coming out of the
affected parts. A friend advised me to buy
a tin of Cuticura Ointment. Thanks to
my friend for recommending it I have saved
any further expense from buying anything
more for it because it has made a complete
cure, and my hair has grown as thick as
on any other part of my head.
“As for the Cuticura Soap, I would use
no other now; I have great faith in it. If
I feel tired after my day’s hard work I just
warm a copper of water and take a warm
bath and make a good lather of the Cuti-
cura Soap and I feel quite refreshed, and
it takes all the pains out of my limbs,which
I was subject to before using the Cuticura
Soap.” (Signed) Samuel Barry, June 24,
1912.
For red, rough, chapped and bleeding
hands, itching, burning palms, and painful
finger-ends with shapeless nails, a one-night
Cuticura treatment works wonders. Soak
hands, on retiring, in hot water and Cuticura
Soap. Dry, anoint with Cuticura Ointment
and wear soft bandages or old, loose gloves
during the night. Cuticura Soap and Oint-
ment are also indispensable for treating
pimples, blackheads and itching, scaly scalps
with dandruff. Cuticura Soap and Cuticura
Ointment are sold throughout the world. ]

If you would like to see the alteration Grey Hairs
make, just lay a piece of paper over each of the two
halves of the above portrait. The Grey “half” will
then be seen to have the appearance of 45 years of
age, whereas the other half looks only 30. Dr. B.
Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut Stain will make
all those years of difference if you are grey or prema-
turely grey. It is perfectly harmless, easy to apply,
and will quickly restore the Hair to the natural shade
°f youth, or younger years.

A new World’s Track Unpaced Hour
record on a bike was recently put up by Marcel
Berthet at Paris, when he blew round the Buffalo
Veladrome for 60min , and covered 26 miles V26yds.
on his dead lonesome. It was a night ride, too, and
at half the distance Berthet was well inside the pre-
vious record. The reception he received after put-
ting up this most strenuous and least artificial of
records beggars description. The Parisians went mad
over him. So this is the third of the world’s fastest
records held by Frenchmen.
* * * *
Apparently there is nothing so unstable
as a world’s record, and the one hour unpaced bike
record of 26 miles 726 yards put up by Marcel
Berthet at Paris, mentioned above, has already
been sent to the woods. And the man that
did it was Berthet himself. He was not, it seems,
satisfied with his previous performance, and a cable
to the Dunlop Rubber Co. announces that he has
now succeeded in covering 27 miles 361 yards in the
60 minutes. The new record was established at
Paris, and probably on the same track on which the
busted record was established. The chances are that
it will be a long while before the new figures are
upset—or that it will be wrecked almost immedi-
ately. You never know.
The fastest speed at which a human being
has travelled 100 miles (barring the fall of Mephis-
topheles from Heaven) was the 119 miles in 50min.
which the French aviator Guillaux traversed at Paris
a week or so ago. The fastest speed done in a motor-
car for 100 miles was the 106 miles 387 yards per
hour, put up by Jules Goux on the Brooklands track,
England. Rather interesting that the two swiftest
human beings (Mephistopheles wasn't human) are
Frenchmen —but then the Gaul always had the repu-
tation of being fast.
The makers of the Sunbeam, the English
car that made a splash in the last two French Grand
Prix races and the Indianop.olis International Speed
Contest, have built a special 12-cylinder car for the
express purpose of smashing all rivals. At a recent
trial on the Brooklands track it got over one half-
mile at the rate of 120 miles per hour. If the car
can live up to this bewildering promise, it means
that a new record book will shortly have to be
printed, and the old one torn up and used for pipe-
iights.
John Roberts, the grand old man of bil-
liards —the big personality among a crowd of common-
place experts—has retired from the game which his
father (the original John) raised to pub-
lic respectability, and proposes to end his
days in nursing his health. The ex-cham-
pion, who has turned 66, owned a pictu-
resque little property in Devonshire (Eng.), but the
climate thereabouts is too mild for the veteran, and
he is shifting his domicile to a breezy seaside district.
He shoiffd be capable of a very readable book of re-
miniscences, for he has travelled a lot in his time.
His first trip to India with the original William
Cook dates back 40 years, or more,
Ernest Barry, the champion sculler, Is get-
ting some gate-money out of the game by appearing
at the London halls. A sketch called “The River
Girl’’ is the medium for the introduction of Barry,
who gives a performance with his sculling apparatus
and delivers a lectuip'tte on the rival methods of
pushing a boat the water. If he gets on
fill-’em-up-again terms' with the music-hall wasters
and sporting has-boens, Barry’s championship will
soon be at the mercy of the first lusty challenger who
takes him on. #
London Evening News is publishing a
series of “Life Stories of Famous Cricketers, told by
Themselves. 99 Frank Tarrant* now the lecognised
“greatest all-round” in England, is the latest. His
story is a dreadful reflection on the Australian
cricketing habit of choosing the has-beens for the
bi" games. Born in Melbourne in 1881,
was educated at Melbourne Christian Brothers- Col-
lege and was taught cricket by his uncle Ambrose
in a back yard. At 15 he joined the Fitzroy club ;-
at 16 he performed the hat trick, two of his victims
beino- Warwick Armstrong and Harry Graham. Next
he was chosen to play for Victoria against Tasmania
and M.L., but was keenly disappointed at being left
out of other inter-State games. He thought he would
have'been selected to play against P. F. Warners
English team in 1902, but he wasn t. Warner,
however, saw him bowling on the Melbourne ground,
and being mightily impressed, asked him whether he
would like to come to London “I had almost given
up hope of ever getting into the first flight of Aus-
tralian cricketers,” he says; so lie jumped at the
offer and became a Middlesex professional Coached
bv C. B. Fry, Ranji and others, he developed into
a first-class batsman as well as a bowler. Now he
makes money in the winter as well as in summei ,
for during the past five years he has spent the
English winter in India as a member of the cricket
team of the Maharajah of Patiala. #
Among tbe camp-followers of the Murkan
baseballers who will presently descend upon this
country the newspaper reporters will be boss bounc-
ers, sure. Twenty years ago, or more, a bast ball
crowd visited these shores, and brought its own his-
torians with them, but that luckless expedition was
only a small matter compared with the threatened
tour of the Chicago “White Sox and N ® w
“Giants.” If the party, including conductors,
advance agents and non-commissioned barrackers, is
to number 100. a half-dozen wnters-up can be taken
for granted. Baseball literature is appalling in its
grandeur. The pitcher of the ball figures as a

“ /I/I T husband, who is a miner,” says Mrs. F. Carr, of
IT A Fridays Fiat, Menzies. W.A., “was struck on the nose
by a stone. The bone was injured and a black spot
appeared. While washing himself he knocked off this spot,
and, through using a mineral water, blood-poisoning set in.
His face swelled to an enormous size, and turned black. The
swelling extended to his body, and we had to call in a doctor,
who treated him, saying when he got better he would attend
to him for his nose. When the swellings were cured my hus-
band again placed himself in the hands of the doctor to have
the injury to his nose treated.
“The doctor operated, but seemed puzzled, and was unable
to diagnose the case. His treatment was finally attended
with disastrous results, for all the skin was rubbed off the

best, failed to bring about a cure. After this we consulted a
specialist at Albany, but his treatment was not attended by
beneficial results. Trying everything we could get hold
ot without any success, despair almost seized us. We had

ERE’S to the Long, Wet, Rollin’ Road,
That’s bore me ’ere an’ there“~an’

An’ cheer again for that same road
That soon again will bear me ’ence—
The oldest road that ever ran,
The longest man ’as ’ad to slog
That ’as been since the world began
An’ the first savage launched a log.
Since the first savage launched ’is log
An' paddled it with ’ands an’ feet,
Through all the long years’ mist an’ fog,
Till now we ’ave the steamers’ beat,
An’ strainin’ sails in every sea.
Where trade ’as come or man ’as go-od ;
From Gabo Light to Galilee
The ships tramp down the Rollin’ Road.
As ships ave tramped the Rollin’ Road
Since skipper Noah's day, unchecked
By all the storms that ever blowed
An’ sunk the earth-roads deep an’ wrecked.
The Road that, ever since, ’as scrolled
Acrost the world's big ’ist’rv book —-
The Road that empires fight to 'old,
The Road that Drake an’ Nelson took.
The Road that Drake an’ Nelson took
To ’umble, sinful Dago pride,
The Road their keels an’ cannon shook
An’ later on. whereon they died.
The Road w’ich Anson, Benbow, Blake,
An’ Admirals o’ high degree,
Was free to loose, or leave, or take—
An’ just as free to you an’ me.
An’ just as free to you an’ me
To pick an’ choose the course we’ll take,
By rutted tracks unmarked to see,
By made roads each ’imself must make.
On no two runnin’ days the same,
An’ yet unchanged as years go by,
From blinkin’ berg to tropic flame
It’s still the same old Road we ply.
It's stili the same old Road we ply.
An’ cheer to make our landfall plain;
But yet an’ yet, until we die,
The road we turn to take again.
For stay we can’t, so go we must,
Till —ships an’ men—to Davy Jones
Our hulks drop down, in dust to dust,
The only dust the Wet Road owns.
The only dust the Wet Road owns—
The salt that crusts the funnels grey,
The salt that’s in our blood an’ bones
That whips our lips wi’ stingin’ spray;
The sprayin’ dust that heads the flood
W’ich surges on the rushin’ keels,
The dust that swirls in drivin’ scud
Beneath the wild white ’orses’ ’eels.
'Ere’s to the wild white ’orses’ ’eels.
The plungin’ backs I 'ave bestrode ;
’Ere’s to the love for them I feels
An’ to their Long Wet Rollin’ Road,
That gave the sweetest I ’ave earned.
That bore me to the best I’ve knowed.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
summer boarder pulled down the
brim of her old panama to shut out a
dazzling streak of light. A westering
sun made a white flash on the iron roof of
the little slab house where visitors were
taken in—on strictly moderate terms. The
dairy-farm was per lied askew on the side of
a hill. It belonged to a large family of hills
which heaved themselves up against the
shoulder of a parent mountain covered with
stiff, spiky whiskers of dead scrub. In front
the paddocks bou ided over bare knobby
mounds till they tell down in a hollow at
some sliprails by the roadside. Here a huge
placard mentioned, in dingy white letters on
a mouse-colored ground, that “Sea View
farm was licensed to sell pure milk.” Board-
ers were alluded to as a postscript, for the
shadow of the Cow brooded over the land.
Jane Smart, hovering on the border of her
thirtieth Christmas, was the only summer
boarder at Sea View. It was cheap, and not
nearly so nasty as many other cheap things
which a clerk in a city rag store has to crowd
into a weekly wage of 30s. In fact, the
effort of supporting existence in a bed-sitting
cupboard, and doing all her own cooking,
washing, and most of her dressmaking, in ad-
dition to grinding from 8.30 a.m. till 6 p.m.
a t a typewriter machine, had worn her
almost as fine as the blade of a crosscut saw.
bhe was getting the same kind of jagged edge
to her nerves. Taking what was left of her
severely in hand, Jane had saved up sufficient
cash to spend her annual 14 days’ holiday on
a dairy-farm. She meant to fill her lean
framework day by day with milk. Unfortu-
nately, she wandered down to see the process
m all its native dirt. After 48 hours’
acquaintance with the conditions of
the milking-shod, the boarder drank
tank water and squirmed at the cream
Jng. But there were compensations,
-the wind blew fresh and cool across
a sapphire wash of sea which lapped the
onse of ironstone cliffs a mile away. And
tnc bald, brown hills, cut into slices by low
stone walls, made a delectable promenade
or city feet. An occasional tail that might
nave a snake at the other end of it could be
seen afar off. The frequent horizon of horns
mat loomed over every other knoll could be
aiagnosed as the property of mild young
or the crumpled antagonism of his
m ?j® sty the Bull, taking his ladies for a
midday stroll. In the latter case there was
ways time to run. When the summer
wanted excitement she followed, afar

airs. Muggins yelled this hospitable querv
over the back fence—if the shabby house
could be said to have more back than front
in any special part pf its ramshackle anat-
omy.
“I’ll come inside !” screamed Miss Smart,
glad that the three o’clock snack gave a
chance of respite from too much bull.
“I’ll bring out your tea, Father —seein’
as you’re busy with him !”
It was a family tradition, loyally invented
by Mrs. Muggins, that “Father.” in spite of
rheumatics in both hands, which naturally
prevented his doing any milking, was a man
of toil. The evening meal was always gar-
nished with stories of the days when Dad
worked his fingers to the bone to make the
farm what it was to-day.
“Seein’ as there’s some rose bushes and a
few chrysanthies I put in this ’ere garden—-
and took out a ton o’ stone afore I could get
me spade down —I’ll jest keep a eye on
Dook so that ’e don’t nip ’em orf.”
Silas sank into the boarders’ low canvas
chair —a sacred chair reserved for paying
guests. He lit his pipe, and mused on the
hard lot of a small dairy farmer. Mrs.
Muggins, a little wizened-up Methuselah of
a woman who had squeezed a century of
toil into 38 years of home life amongst the
cow bails, flicked a kitchen chair, for Miss
Smart.
“Not too much milk,” said the boarder
hurriedly. “Er—no —l’m not very fond of
it- —that is—l like the tea just colored.”
In the interval of washing, scrubbing
floors, scalding cans, milking cows and bak-
ing bread when the baker’s cart forgot to
call, Mrs. Muggins had once found time to
present her husband with twins. They
came tumbling into the kitchen now. after
chasing the milkers' into the stockyard.
“Hello Mum —got some tea? By crikey,
it’s hot goin’ after them busted”
“Ladies present!” said Mum; “now yous
just wait on yourselves. I’m goin’ to have a
bite in peace, and so is Miss Smart.”
“Hi, here comes the Kid !”
Seth and Ike gave ’Melia a vociferous wel-
come, and pushed her into a steep declivity
in an ancient settee that wobbled on three-'*
legs near the fireplace.
“Gammon you ain’t found thet calf!”
“What kind o’ a calf is it, Kid? I hope
you ain’t had the cheek to find twins. One
pair’s enough, I reckon, on this here farm!”
“Yous jest let ’Melia be—and behave
yourselves—or I won’t give yous another
bite. Here you, Ike, take this out to
Father!”
’Melia mopped her hot face, flung her
mane of tawny hair off her forehead, pulled
her rag of a skirt well down over her knees,
and swallowed a cup of scalding hot fluid
before she replied.
“I ain’t found it!”
“What!” Mrs. Muggins dropped the
kettle on the hob, and stood rooted to the
floor.
“I ain’t found neither of ’em !” ’Melia s
sullen air of defeat surrounded this remark,
which was. dislocated by passing through a
mouthful of scone.
“G’arn —ye’re just kiddin!” Then the
red-headed twin who was Seth, rushed out
to tell the bad tidings to Father. He fell up
against Ike and the two raced off to break
the news.
“Well, I’m blest!”
Mum’s hair was done up in tight little
plaits screwed together on top of her head.
Every plait quivered with shock as she ab-
sentlv stabbed the whole coiffure with a long
hairpin. She had picked this weapon out
of a crack in the floor, and kept on driving
it through her hair as she stared at ’Melia.
“If that heifer gets away an’ dies in the
bush it’ll just knock spots out o’ Father!
She’s the best beast on the place ’cept the
“I’ll find ’em ter-night if I die fer it,” said
the Kid, stung by the unaccustomed sense of
failure. To her warped intelligence the great
round world swung on the axis of the Cow.
A fierce loyalty to Mum and the twins drove
her day and night like the lash of a whip.
To the boarder, used'to the frank hatred
of the underpaid girl employee for the
wealthy employer, and the contempt that
mutiuous young person always showed for
his property, this devotion was a whole chap-
ter of revelations. ’Melia, child of the
State, gave gold for copper, new lamps for
old, the best that was in her of honest ser-

KIDNEY TROUBLE
IS SERIOUS.
IT used to be thought
that only urinary
troubles and back-
ache were to be traced
to the kidneys, but
modern science now
shows that many fatal
diseases have their
beginninginirregulari-
ties of these important
organs.
For the kidneys are
the blood purifiers.
Every few minutes the
blood passes through
them to be purified.
But when the kid-
neys are weak and in-
flamed they cannot
keep up with their
great work, and so the

in the blood, and the whole body is being slowly poisoned.
You soon feel languid, dizzy and worn out. You cannot
sleep cannot eat —you grow irritable and miserable.
Puffy circles come under the eyes the ankles swell —the
muscles and joints are stiff and rheumatic. There are urinary
disorders, and you have to get up many times during the
night. Your back is weak and aching —you may have sciatic
pains and lumbago. . .

SYDNEY MAN CURED.
(<T e orge Woodroffe, 10 Roseby Street, Drummoyne, Sydney, writes: —
1 derived very great benefit from the use of Doan’s Backache Kidney
L lUs - f iave been a great sufferer with the kidneys for the past 17 years.
IV D s , u , j™ gs started with a cold, and eventually inflammation of the kidneys
and bladder set in. 1 have been treated by some of the cleverest and best-
known Sydney doctors, and was for 174 w r eeks in the Sydney Hospital. I
\vas also two months in the Coast Hospital, where I had one kidney removed,
-though the various treatments eased me for a time, I was not cured, and
wruild soon relapse into my former ill-health. I also tried patent medicines
advertised to cure kidney complaint, but they did not even give me tem-
porary relief. My brother was always worrying me to try Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, if I only took one bottle. To please him 1 got them, and
before I had finished the bottle I felt extraordinarily well. I had not felt
so well for years; the pills were working wonders for me. I continued
taking them, and am now perfectly cured of every symptom of kidney
trouble.”
Mr. Woodroffe confirms the above eight years later“My cure has
lasted, for I am still free of every symptom of kidney and bladder trouble.
All sufferers should know about Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers
at 2s. 9d. per bottle (six bottles 15s. 3d.), or w’ill be posted on receipt of

BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS
CURES BY DOAN’S OINTMENT.
PILES.
FOUR YEARS CURED.
Mr. Henry Adams, 44 Edith Street. St.
Peters, Sydney, says: “I want to tell you
of the benefits I have derived from using
your Doan’s Ointment. I suffered for
years from bleeding and protruding piles,
and no one but the sufferer knows the
agony of this ailment. I had tried dozens
of remedies, but could get no relief. I
saw Doan’s Ointment advertised, and de-
cided to give it a trial. After a few appli-
cations I was relieved, and two pots
effected a complete cure. I am absolutely
free of- the piles. I think my quick and
lasting cure shows that Doan’s Ointment
is a positive cure for this trying com-
plaint.’’
Three years later Mrs. Adams says : “I
am pleased to be able to bring the above
statement up to date by telling you my
husband has been free of piles ever since
Doan’s Ointment cured him nearly four
years ago.
ECZEMA.
TWO YEARS CURED.
Mrs. .T. Thompson, 3 Onslow Street,
Granville, says : “For a long time I was
tortured with eczema. The pain and irri-
tation of this ailment are dreadful, the
days are miserable, and the nights sleep-
less. I tried all sorts of remedies, but
nothing did me any good. I also con-
sulted a doctor, but his treatment did not
benefit me. My son induced me to get a
pot of Doan’s Ointment, and I am glau
I did, for after a few applications I
noticed an improvement. I continued the
treatment, and after using two pots
was completely cured. Doan’s Ointmen
is wonderful, and I never miss an oppor-
tunity of praising it. Eczema is a terr -
ble complaint, and other sufferers will d
pleased to know of a sure cure.
Two vears later Mrs. Thompson say--
“I have had no return of eczema since
Doan’s Ointment cured me two yea..
ago, so I reckon I am cured for good.
Doan's Ointment is sold by all Chemists and Stores at

vice for the bare right to live. She slept on
a torn mattress full of lumps like clods of
earth. This she dragged out of a mouse-
haunted cupboard every night and flung on
the kitchen floor. She got up at four in the
morning, winter and summer. The vigilant
Silas had always attended to this part of
the Kid’s training. lie set an alarum to
that hour, and automatically bawled from
his bed in the next room: “Git up there,
’Melia, yer lazy Kid!” By force of long
habit, she could not only stumble to her feet
in the middle of a dream, but half dress her-
self before she was properly awake. Mum
and the twins fell into their clothes in the
same half-dazed fashion, while the head of
the house wanted to know what time o’ day
they meant to start the milking. Then Silas,
having finished the hardest part of his day’s
toil, turned over and snatched his morning
nap.
, “I’ll get ’em right enuff, when ther milk-
in’s done.” ’Melia added this codicil to her
will, as she rushed out of the door. Ike and
Seth clanked big milk cans and yelled to the
Kid to wait a jiffey.
“I seen where they got out. The fence is
broke up behind the lantana on the hill. I
tracked ’em down to the waterhole. Maybe
they’ve got away to that green feed down
by Marley’s,” she called back.
“Yer must be kiddin' yer carn’t find ’em,”
bawled Silas as the Kid raced down to the
stockyard. But the swollen udders of the
mothers of the herd were an insistent call,
and the family had no time to argue with
Dad.
“If ’twern’t for the rheumatics in me fin-
gers” began Silas.
“That needn’t stop yous from walkin’
round an’ having a look for ’em!” This
unexpected parting shot from Mrs. Muggins
drove Silas to the only comparatively easy
chair in the kitchen. “When a man’s own
missis turns agon him, it’s a bad lookout —
eh. Miss Smart?”
But the boarder affected not to-hear. Sh ■
was putting the ends of the fire together and
wondering how she could concoct a meal for
the family on the • jiggling bars of an old
colonial oven.
“I’m going to give them a surprise and
have the tea all ready. Then we can all go
off and help ’Melia.’*
“She don’t expect it! By crikey, I’ve
brought her up to work. There’s/nothing in
this world I’m up agen so much as loafin’.
Y\ ork is the finest thing a nipper can liev.
T giv £l2 for that Jersey heifer, and the
Kid d —d well "knows she’s got to find ’er!”
Then the father of the family cut up a
small wad of tobacco and went forth to
ruminate on the uncertain habits of dairy
cattle.
A pale young moon hung low in a sky of
pearl and amethyst. The cabbage-tree palms
rustled their stiff green petticoats in a lazy
breeze that made furtive catspaws on the
summer sea. Silhouetted against the glory
"f the paling sunset, the great Moreton Bay
figs stood like carved stone, fashioned in the
form of foliage. Jane Smart, with the
macadamised instinct of a, dweller in cities,
had followed the road till she came to the
track that turned off to Marley’s cultivation
patch. This skirted the edge of steep cliffs.
The Muggins family were distributed
amongst the sheltered gullies behind the
house. A wild bellow from the edge of the
cliff sent Jane flying over the loose stones on
the cattle track that meandered to the end
of Marley’s fence. One panel was down, and
the lost beast was tearing up and down on
the top of the wall of scarred rock that made
a sheer drop of a hundred feet to the sea
below. The tide was out. A thin line of
white foam licked the creamy sand where a
few belated gulls scavenged amongst the
leavings of the ocean.
“The pest of a calf has fallen over the
edge, Jane told herself. But a hideous fear
knocked at her heart, and drove her forward
stumbling, panting in the gathering dusk.
A hundred yards away a precipitous track
made a possible descent to the beach. Once
she nearly fell off its narrow foothold. A
dismal wail from the calf caught in a ledge
of bush and rock, not ten feet below the top
proved that the cause of the trouble was
alive. With torn hands and lacerated shoe
leather, Jane reached the bottom, and blun-
dered ankle-deep in the soft sand till she
found It. A small heap of shabby frock
and a dead white face, with a screaming
gull fluttering overhead.
“Gome, ’Melia, don’t be frightened! I’m
going to carry you home. You didn’t guess
what strong arms I had —did you, poor
Kid ?”
But she knew that the sea fowl’s instincts
were sure. This was only a body—flotsam
and jetsam, to be inquired into With the
sharp point of a beak that probed like a lan-
cet. She tried to lift the Kid, but the dead
weight of that small limp figure was awful.
She sat down and tried to think. Then she
remembered that less than a quarter of a
mile along the coast the cliffs fell away to
sandy knoll covered with coarse tussocks.
Some fisher folk had a small humpy on this
rise. It took a long time for these two —
the Living and the Dead —to reach this shel-
ter. and Jane heralded their arrival with
shrill screams. The raw edges of her nerves
had to be soothed with uproar. Tenderly
enough they took It in, for the Kid was quite
an old and much-respected serf in Cowland.
“She must have chased ’em out o’ Mar-
ley’s, an’ got too near the edge. To think
of ’er, the cutest kid in the district with
beasts to come to. ’er end like this !”
“I'd like to wring the neck o’ Silas Mug-
gins. Why doesn’t he do a bit o’ work him-
self —the skunk !”
They cackled drearily over the body while
Jane, with her brain on fire, raced over the
hills to the farm. She wanted to say some-
thing ; to do something that would pierce
the hide of Silas. Like a mad thing she
burst into the kitchen. He was dozing on
the old settee.
“Wake up—you lazy beast! She’s dead
—broken her neck ! Why didn’t you look for
her yourself?”
She fell upon him, shaking him with the
fury of a wild cat, before he had time to
leap to his feet. The dull brain of Muggins
searched for an idea. This crazy woman—
he had never liked her quiet ways—was the
secret emissary of some gang of fools in Syd-
ney who sent people to gaol for alleged cruelty
to animals. The heifer was dead—a horri-
ble loss —but he was more concerned about
it than anyone else.
“I give ’er the best feed I ’ad.” he said
sullenly. “She were a silly fool to clear out.
Serve her d—d right if she did break ’er
bloomin’ neck !”
Jane picked up the nearest missile, a small
wooden stool, and flung it at his head. It
missed him and struck ’Melia’s kangaroo pup,
which fled howling into the night. Silas
followed, yelling for the family to come and
save his life. They tumbled down the near-
est hill and rushed breathless into the kit-
chen.
“Gawd lieli) us—what’s the matter?”
cried Mum. Ike and Seth flung themselves
on the summer boarder, but she beat them
back.
“Keep away. I want to hurt that lazy
beast of a slave-driver! She’s dead, I teil
you! Fell over the cliffs!”
“An’ I’ll never see my 12 quid agen!”
groaned Silas emboldened by the presence
of Mum and the twins.
Jane made another rush at. the enemy,
this time with the poker, but the room was
running round, and Silas was only a sway-
ing shape, of something detestable in the
middle. Mum held her boarder with both
hands, and implored her to tell them if
she’d been bitten by a mad dog.
“It’s ’Melia —she’s only a body—she—the
gulls were fighting over her —I carried her
to —she’s quite dead” Then the little
slab house seemed to fall on top of the sum-
mer boarder. Mum failed to grasp the
hideous truth. “Git the dipper, Seth, an’
douse ’er with water. She's a bit light-
headed !”
Rut a light pierced the thick skull of
Muggins. His mean face looked almost
cheerful. The State had thousands of chil-
dren. He was a poor man and had onlv
one Jersey cow.
“By Gosh, Mum. ’tain’t the ’eifer, arter
all! It’s on’y the Kid !”

A Tale of Suburban Enterprise.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Burglary and robbery from the person must still
be regarded as pleasant evening amusements for
some of the pale residents of the suburbs until the
police force is materially strengthened.
—Sydney payer.
A LITTLE moon all thin and pale
Was sitting in the simple sky ;
A small bird wagged its small black
tail,
The long, bright day began to die ;
The harbor boats made frequent wail
From brazen throats, with coal-dust dry.
The sun arranged for a display
Of colored fire before he sank;
A little wind across the bay
Blew in my whiskers saltly dank ;
And I had twenty pounds to pay
With four-and-sixpence in the bank.
I cast about for some wise plan
To raise the cash to meet the bill;
I thought to slay my fellow man,
Or crack a crib, or rob a till;
For sitting there the world to scan
Had positively made me ill.
On every boat that crossed the tide
There were at least one hundred men
Whose bank accounts so swelled with pride
That with one flutter of a pen
They could such woes as mine deride
And multiply the sum by ten.
The person that I tipped last night
For bringing me some drops of wine
Had never been in such a plight,
Or known such poverty as mine;
He, too, the ready cheque could write
That hardest banks would not decline.
Thinking such thoughts, my soul grew thin,
And bitter envy moved me sore ;
The cash that seemed so hard to win
Was freely dumped at every door,
Save mine. With heart as hard as sin
I gazed upon the darkening shore.
Such was my mood when eve grew late,
I burned to slay and smite and rob,
To grab the world with hands of hate
And make it yell and writhe and sob ;
Then Thompson through the garden gate
Came in to borrow fifteen bob.
Here was a pal to match my need ;
I rose and gripped him by the hand ;
I told him that some purse must bleed,
And made him swiftly understand
That as we needed cash with speed
Some golden fish our hooks must land.
Armed with revolvers forth we fared,
The night grew very dark and cold ;
We stuck up twelve lone wights, and shared
Some silver and five pounds in gold ;
Our looks were fierce, and no one dared
His private treasure to withhold.
I revelled in my glad, gay sin,
But Thompson with remorse was torn;
I had to rake those dollars in.
And treated his affright with scorn;
By hook or crook I needs must win
My twenty pounds before the morn.
We struck a prize at Alfred-street.
A heavy person glad with beer
Approached us on unsteady feet
And yielded eighteen guineas clear;
We merely made him take a seat,
And cocked a pistol at his ear.
We wandered round by Neutral Bay
Collecting cash from all we met;
We only tried to take away
As much hard coin as we could get,
And everyone seemed pleased to pay
The simple tribute that we set.
Light hearted as a homing bird
I took my bedward way at last;
Some folk might deem my joy absurd,
But every danger now was past—
“ Bail up !” I heard the sudden word.
And through the darkness peered aghast.
“Bail up !” I knew the voice that spoke
In accenfs full of wrath and dread.
I smote him with a counter-stroke;
“Still out collecting. .Tones?” I said.
And like a whiff of frightened smoke
That highway robber turned and fled.
But I passed on with laughter light,
And gained the home I deemed secure.
There paused in wonder and affright
At trouble past my power to cure—
Some dark marauder of the night
Had stolen all my furniture.

CONCERNING A COMMON COMPLAINT.
Of all common ailments perhaps Constipation is the one most fruitful of
ill-health and a potent cause of disease in a variety of forms. Too fre-
quently neglected (especially by women) it may result in grave conse-
quences, and all who suffer from it in any degree should set about
establishing a permanent cure without delay. Failure of the bowels to
act properly results in poisonous accumulations, impure blood, sluggish
liver, and a great number of disorders such as headaches, nervous debility
anaemia, loss of energy, and even diseases of a chronic and dangerous
nature. If you are troubled with this really serious complaint do not
regard it as a light matter, and remember that the cure may be surely
and speedily effected by means of
