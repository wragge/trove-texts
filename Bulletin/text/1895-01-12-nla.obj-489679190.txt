THE “KEEPER” PILE PILL
(Registered).
The PROPRIETORS of these Pills are well aware that
there are many remedies (some of them really beneficial)
for this painful disease already in the market, hut know-
ing as they do the wonderful success of the “ KEEPER”
PILL they have no hesitation in placing it in the very
front rank of Curative Medicines.
For years the medicine had only a local and limited
use, but now arrangements have been completed to make
its merits more widely known, and the Australasian
colonies will have an opportunity of sharing with the old
country the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will be sold on its merits. In confident
assurance that its beneficent action will be a real boon to
sufferers.
It will not cure Piles in old and chronic cases by a single
dose. It wifi not cure every disease that flesh is heir to,
but it will cure Piles if taken in reasonable time, and
IT WILL GIVE RELIEF IN ALL OASES,
however stubborn and chronic, and the proprietors are
continually in receipt of most flattering and unsolicited
testimonials. Price, 2 6 per box (red label).
The “KEEPER” LIVER PILL.
We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids which are
complicated with liver trouble, and we have therefore
perfected a Liver Pill to be used alone, or in conjunction
with the “Keeper” Pile Pill. We do not claim tor this,
or for any of our preparations, any marvellous curative
properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/3 in a box of “ KEEPER”
LIVER PILLS (blue label) and you will not regret it.
The “KEEPER” HEALTH PILL.
If you are worried in-business, if you are jaded by over-
work, if you are generally run down from any cause, T"Y
THIS PILL. It is a prince of pick-me-ups. In one size
only (brown label), 6 6 per box.
The title the “KEEPER” PILL is registered as our
trade mark throughout the colonies, and any infringement
thereof will be promptly dealt with by the sole proprietors,

“ For the anonymous system which is not
n, y anon y m °us there is nothing to be said at
all.”—Times.
The Russian policy is to make Constanti-
nople the Muscovite capital, instead of St. Peters-
burg. ihe latter isn't a real city : it has never
taken root, and merely exists because it is the arti-
ficial metropolis of the empire. When the Czar
moves to Constantinople, Petersburg will fade
away like a drearn-oity at daybreak.
Lord Salisbury holds five acres of land in
the vicinity of Charing Cross (the very heart of
ijondon), for which his ancestors paid ten shillings
an acre. It was secured as grazing land 250 years
ago. A magnificent object-lesson on unearned
incre-ment here. The land reverts to the State in
another 250 years, unless the State in the mean-
time gets sense, and decides that the Cecils have
already had too much of a good thing.
lb -Prussia the murder of men, women,
and children is frequent by the bayonets and
bullets of guards and sentinels. The other day a
little boy was on the grass of a square in Berlin :
the guard tried to arrest him, the child, fright-
ened, ran away and the guard shot him dead.
Such occurrences are frequent. If a newspaper
condemns them, the editor is imprisoned.” —“ The

nightly Review.
at °^‘°^' WQr k swagman lately struck the
A.S. w. border town of Cockburn, and reflecting
that it would be better' to be conveyed by rail to
Gladstone (S. A.), the locality of the nearest gaol,
than to walk there, took off a boot and sent it
through the nearest window on the S.A. side.
Ihe local beak was “equal to the occasion.” Learn-
ing the circumstances, he mulcted the out-of-work
swagman in 2s. 3d. damages and 10s. costs. That
being the exact sum the latter had on him when
arrested, he ruefully paid up and went his way.
Why he didu t send his other boot through
another window is not explained.

MEDIUM-SI/bD LADY, supposed to be very lightly
clad Any information will be thankfully received at
the above address.
.Dear 13 ulletin, At one time of the year
the wild bees near Lake Taupo collect poisonous
honey from a certain native tree, and several
deaths have occurred through using it. The
symptoms of honey-poisoning are great thirst
with vomiting, cramps, &c. About fifteen years
ago, when 1 was on a survey in the Upper Wai-
kato, some Maoris had robbed a wild bees’ hive
and had taken about 2cwt. of honey. It had a
peculiar look which they considered suspicious.
U nder such circumstances it is usual to try it first dp
a dog, but as the dogs in this settlement happened
to be all valuable for wild-pig hunting, this way of
testing the honey seemed too risky. That evening,
however, a swagsman came tramping down the
road, and it was decided to use him for purposes
of experiment, A young half-caste stopped him
with— ‘ Are you fond of honey, mate ? If you
are, come here and have a feed.” “ ’Oney,” said
the swagger, “ I ain’t ’ad a good blow-out of
oney since I left the old country.” He ate about
41b. of it and was then invited to stay all night.
He did so and had some more honey for his
supper. As he was alive in the morning the
honey was then distributed round. If fie hadn’t
been alive there would have been an unobtrusive
funeral.—Yours, &c., Takauuna,
All the rage in Paris. Latest Parisian

You 11 recognise this dame at night,
The one who’s gone astray,
Her age is quite indefinite.
Her hair is either dark or light,
Or else it’s turning grey ;
No other mark or brand she had
Except that she was lightly clad.
She may have wandered near or far—
Her name, it would appear,
Is nothing in particular,
Her weight’s not mentioned in the par.
And only one thing’s clear,
That she’ll be brought back to her dad
Because she’s only “ lightly clad.”
Her eyes are either black or blue,
Or else, perhaps, they’re grey,
Or else they aie some other hue;
She has one leg or, maybe, two,
This dame who’s gone away ;
It doesn’t say she’s sane or mad
But only that she’s lightly clad.
Her age is eighteen years or more,
Or else she’s forty-three,
Or twelve, or, maybe, just three-score ;
She left one Monday sharp at four,
Alone, or else in company,
With someone either good or bad,
And started very lightly clad.
Her size, we note, is med-i-um,
Whatever that may be;
She may be either deaf or dumb :
The advertiser names no sum
As a reward for he
Who finds this lady lost and sad,
Who’s wandering round so lightly clad.
She’s gone to China or Japan,
Or else to Emerald Hill;
Her name, perchance, was Mary Ann,
Perhaps she went off with a man— ’
Perhaps his name was Bill.
But he who seeks her will be glad
To know that she is lightly clad.

SATURDAY, JANUARY 12, 1895.
State Life Insurance.
Last week the Equitable Lite Insurance
Co. of the United States opened its
magnificent Sydney offices with a gor-
geous festivity which almost elevated the
event into a matter of national importance.
Some hundreds of guests, including almost
all the political and social celebrities of
Sydney, were entertained at a costly banquet
and reception, and amid the rich viands and
the high-priced wines they rose up and
delivered many columns of enthusiastic
oratory about things in general and the
Equitable Co. in particular. The Equitable
is one of the very big things of the United
States—a country where everything is either
very big or very small. The U.S. owns the
“ three American Giants”—the biggest in-
surance concerns on earth ; the Santa
railroad—the largest and about the most
hopelessly bankrupt line possessed anywhere
by a single corporation ; and, until a few
weeks ago, it owned Tammany Hall, the
biggest individual scandal in Christendom.
It lias also the largest nigger problem, the
largest silver problem, the longest river, the
most imposing bridge, the most formidable
pension list, and the highest record for
progress, wealth, murders, manufactures,
agriculture, philanthropy, meanness, dis-
turbances, and many other things, in this
world. It has the largest hotels in existence,
and yet the majority of its banks are two-
roomed concerns, ten of which combined
would hardly make the smallest note-issuing
bank in Australia. It is a land of gorgeous-
ness and innumerable contradictions, where
a feverish race lives in a feverish atmosphere
of continual boom, and its representatives
abroad do their best to live up to their
national reputation—which is partly real and
partly bogus—for frenzied activity and a
general capacity for annexing the whole
earth.
* * •
The offices which the Equitable has just
opened are a brilliant example of the
advertising capabilities of the American
race. With the exception of one or two
Government buildings they form the biggest
single tenement in Sydney. They are built
on the most expensive site in Sydney, and
occupy the most central position which
could be found. They are about the
most noble-looking thing in the way of archi-
tecture, both internally and externally, that
the city can show. Outside they are a vision
of costly grey stone and marble ; internally
they are more magnificent than most royal
palaces. They are a dream of glittering
marble, rich coloring, graceful carving, vel-
vet carpets, expensive furniture, and every
kind of magnificence. They are vaguely
suggestive, in short, of Ahasubrus on the
burst—of Belshazzar, or Sardanapulus,
or Lorenzo the Magnificent, or anybody
else who left behind him a reputation
for more than the usual splendour of
monarchs in a garish age, when monarchs
were still of some account. And, behind all
this display, the Equitable has £35,000,000
worth of assets and an annual income of
£9,000,000. It claims to be the biggest
insurance office on earth, and, true to its
policy of advertisement, it piles up a building
in which the offices of its two greatest local
rivals could be stowed away out of
sight with abundance of space to spare.
And, meanwhile, about 100 yards away,
the Mutual of New York is heaping up a
tenement of almost equal vastness, with the
same desire to overshadow all competitors.
Life-insurance business, like everything else,
is a matter of advertisement, and enormously
expensive offices and every other kind of
promiscuous garishness are all means to the
same end,
• m •
Yet if the New South Wales Government,
following the wise example set in Maoriland,
chose to establish a State Life Insurance
Office, with the guarantee of the consolidated
revenue behind it, and under good manage-
ment, all this display would come to nought.
The State Insurance Department need not
advertise on anything like the lavish scale
of its rivals. It could commence its career
in a wooden building, with a dozen clerks
sitting at cheap pine desks on cheap pine
stools. It could dispense with the stone and
marble, with the carpets and car ings, the
pillars, the enamelled tiles, the dadoes, the
costly furniture, and all the rest of the
architectural grandeur. It could leave out
the banquet, the speeches, and the opening
ceremony generally ; it would be quite
sufficient if, on the Monday morning when
it commenced operations, a plain-looking old
man, in patched pants, came down and
opened the front door with a large iron key,
and put up a bill outside stating that the
Department was now prepared to begin busi-
ness. There would be no necessity for a
brilliant oration from the manager on the
prospects and resources of the province ; all
he would have to do would be to arrive with
reasonable punctuality, and hang up his
second-best hat on a nail, and get to
work without ceremony. And with the
guarantee of a fourth-rate Government
behind it, and the security of an embarrassed
revenue, and the endorsement of a little
community of not one-and-a-quarter million
souls, that institution would presently cut
the ground from beneath the three American
giants, and the A.M.P., and the other five
big local societies, and become the most pro-
gressive concern of its kind in Australia.
# # *
The first and last and greatest essential in
life-insurance business is Security. The
questions of large bonuses, small premiums,
and liberal conditions are mere side-issues.
The man who insures his life, does it, in a
very large proportion of instances, because
his policy will be the main support of his
family after his death —because it will be
almost the only thing which stands between
them and poverty ; and therefore Security is
the great essential. Absolute safety, of
course, cannot be obtained anywhere in this
world, but the largest possible measure of it
is what every intelligent person strives after.
The one thing which is certain about every
assurance society, every bank, every Govern-
ment, and every mundane institution what-
soever, is that it will come to an end—some
day ; but the merit of a State Bank or a State
Insurance Department is that it is almost
certain to outlive all rivals. ■ The private
institution lasts until dishonesty, or mis-
management, or the unavoidable depre-
ciation of its investments through some far-
reaching public calamity, reduces it to bank-
ruptcy. The State institution lasts long
after that period ; it may be bankrupt a
dozen times over, but the public revenue
will make up the loss and set it going again,
and it is only when the public revenue can’t
make good the loss any longer that it
definitely comes to grief. The difference in
these, two sets of circumstances is «o great,
and the advantages of the State institution
are so enormous, that the failure of this
country to follow the example set by Maori-
land can only be ascribed to the apathetic
character of the Australian people.
* » #
The condition of life insurance business in
Australia is, in most respects, quite as satis-
factory as that existing in any other part of
the world. Yet, in many respects, it
is woefully unsatisfactory. The directors,
by whom the business is managed,
are elected by the policy-holders, yet very
few of the latter have any real knowledge of
their character or qualifications. The audi-
tors are, in most cases, elected in a similar
fashion, but not one in a hundred among
the policy-holders knows anything about
their honesty or their ability. The real
value of the audit is an unknown quantity.
Hardly anyone knows when the assets were
last valued, or by whom, or with what result.
No one outside the inner circle can tell
whether advances were made on safe valua-
tions, or if loans were made up to 60, or 60,
or 70, or even more per cent, of the value of
the security. The safety or otherwise of the
investments can be roughly estimated, by
those skilled in such matters, by the amount
of interest in arrear, large arrears generally
meaning a mass of rather dubious securi-
ties ; but very few offices reveal even this
item in their balance-sheets. A further
estimate can be made by the amount of property
acquired under foreclosure, but this item is
also, in most cases, an unexplained mystery.
These matters are of less importance, how-
ever, because not one person in a thousand
is capable of learning anything from a bal-
ance-sheet, no matter how clear and well-
defined it may be. The groat majority judge
by the vastness of the society’s figures, the
size of its bonuses, the imposing nature of
its advertisements, and the magnificence of
its premises. The community calls for these
proofs of its solidity—which are really proofs
of nothing at all—and the offices, of neces-
sity, do their best to supply them. If they
could supply any coherent evidence of their
solvency which the ignorant public would
understand they would probably do so, but
the public, as a whole, is not gifted with
understanding, and is incapable of compre-
hending evidence. The ideal insurance
manager would be one who could heal the
sick or raise the dead, like an apostle of old,
that being the sort of utterly irrelevant
testimony which the majority of the popula-
tion would best appreciate. A good deal of
the obscurity of insurance balance-sheets is
probably owing to the fact that obscurity
conveys to most people just as much infor-
mation as anything else.
» • •
This helplessness on the part of the great
bulk of the community, and the evils to which
it is always liable to give lise, are powerful
arguments in favor of a State Insurance
Department. At least 90 per. cent, of share-
holders and policyholders are hopelessly in-
capable of safeguarding their own interests
in any intelligent fashion. An Insurance
Department which is guaranteed by the
State provides against this blind and hap-
hazard system of control, by assigning as the
security for each policy, not only the accumu-
lated funds of the office itself, but the whole
assets of the State, its revenues, its credit
at home and abroad, and everything
of value belonging to it. Considering that
life-insurance is a business which, more
than any other, demands Security above
all things, the value of such an institution
cannot be over-estimated. The experience
of the Maoriland Government Department,
which now does more business in its own
province than all its rivals combined, which
has grown in a few years to be the second
largest affair of its kind in Australasia, and
which yields better returns, and is less expen-
sively worked than all save the A.M.P. only,
proves sufficiently well the advantages of the
system. So far as The Bulletin knows,
there is notoneamong the six large Australian
institutions which is in a really danger-
ous condition. But without some system of
effective Government supervision the public
is not likely to know that any office is in a
dangerous condition until it is past repair, so
that even if the evidences of solvency were
ten times as conclusive as theyare the demand
for State life-insurance would be none the
less strong.

farmers are now compelled to sell their wheat in Sydney
at a lower price than competitive supplies from Victoria
or elsewhere could be delivered at, even if the duties
were abolished. The summing up of the whole business
is, that under any circumstances the farmers here must
lose under the protective system, as in Victoria, and
everywhere else where it has been tried. The unwise
stimulus which the mistaken idea of gaining the tax per
bushel gives to production soon brings down the price
obtainable in the local market.
And this is Sydney Telegraph in its leading
article of Friday, January 4, wailing because
Protection makes food dear and enables the
farmer to grow rich at the expense of the poor
consumer :
The simple truth is that Mr. Reid would not have dared
to venture before the country prior to the election with
any such proposal on his lips as that, for the sake of the
farmers or millers, a majority of the people should go on
bearing a heavy burden of taxation. Any such suggestion
would rightly have stamped him as a Protectionist in dis-
guise, and a politician unworthy to be trusted by any
side.
The Bulletin now respectfully asks this lying
prophet to straighten up, and say in plain
language what he really does mean—if he really
does mean anything. According to these state-
ments, Protection lays a “ heavy burden of
taxation ” on “ the majority of the people ” for
the benefit of the farmers—which obviously
means that Protection enables the farmer to
extract more money from the people. Also,
Protection is an evil because it brings down
prices ; “ the farmers must lose by it“ the
unwise stimulus brings down the price obtain-
able in the local market,” &c. Consequently,
Protection is doubly a curse, for it makes prices
go up and thus taxes the consumer for the
benefit of the farmer, and, at the same time, it
makes the prices of the same articles go down
and ruins the farmer—whereby the Telegraph’s
readers are presented with the weird spectacle
of a thing going in two opposite directions at
once. Also, the fact that Protection always
lowers prices is further demonstrated by the
alleged fact that the protected grain of Victoria
is dearer than the protected grain of New
South Wales—a few weeks ago, by the way, the
Telegraph proved that it was cheaper, but that
doesn’t matter ; and because the protected grain
of New South Wales is too cheap to pay
the farmer, the Freetrade organ wants to
assist him by making him compete with addi-
tional supplies from outside. The Cornstalk
agriculturist is being injured by Protection
because his grain fetches less than that of the
Victorian, and the Victorian agriculturist is
ruined by Protection because his grain fetches
more than that of the Cornstalk. And while
the farmer’s charges to the consumer are going
down in this dreadful fashion, and he is urged
to throw off the yoke of Protection in order to
get the prices up again, the consumer, it seems,
according to the same paper, is bearing a heavy
burden of taxation in order to prop up the
farmer, and he is urged to throw oil' the same
yoke in order to force the farmer’s prices down.
Will the Telegraph kindly explain its own
Freetrade principles ?
The Betting- Law.
A group of objectionable clerics and repellent
females, known as the Anti-Gambling League,
are threatening to do a good work by prose-
cuting the English Jockey Club ks an aider and
abettor of “ the odds ”on racecourses. The
reform intended by the League is something
very different from the work it will accomplish,
if the threat be carried out, which circum-
stance merely coulirms the truth of the old
parsonic statement that Providence moves in a
mysterious way. An indictment of the Jockey
Club for permitting bookmakers to ply the.r
trade under its auspices must inevitably rid the
world of a loathsome legal scandal. Betting on
horse-races in England, as in Australia, is
punishable under an Act of Parliament, the
said Act being enforced, or overlooked, by a
corrupt police conscience, without a tittle of
regard for decency or common-sense. When
enforced, it often happens that the law is
faithfully administered, or smothered, as the
case may be, by a judge who himself patro-
nises the very offence he is discuss-
ing. Justice Hawkins, for instance, may
back a horse at Epsom one day, and next day
impose a tine upon somebody convicted of lay-
ing against a horse in Fleet-street, though he is
well aware the while that the law draws no
distinction between a racecourse “ring ” and a
turf “commissioner’s” office, or a gambling
club. They are all betting places within the
meaning of the Act. One shameless rule has
hitherto been followed in the prosecution of
bookmakers —the rule that no steps should be
taken to interfere with the liberty of noble
lords. When his Grace, the Duke, came in at
the door the abashed Law flew out at the
window, so to speak. The betting-account of
Royal Albert Edward could be settled at
Tattersall’s with impunity, but a petty cash
bookmaker paying or receiving at any “ shy ”
rendezvous in the neighborhood ran a great
risk of being raided at his busiest time if he had
omitted to bribe his blackmailing acquaintances,
the police. So with betting-clubs— i.e., clul s
instituted for the transaction of wagers on
horse races, and maintained for that purpose
alone. The law drew no distinctions, but the
police and judges did. The scandal was so old
that it had become almost venerable w'hen the
Anti-Gambling League began to bore its
righteous nose into the root of the matter.
Last year the lessees of Northampton race-
course were summoned, at the influential insti-
gation of the League, for permitting two rings
to be used for an illegal purpose. The lessees are
Messrs. Frail, whose father was a race-meeting
proprietor before them, and w-hose coat-of-arms
ought to include a skinned lamb and a Hebrew
rampant. Well, the Northampton magisl rates
were confronted last June by the awkward fact
that Messrs. Frail had made “rings ” on their
racecourse, and such rings are illegal. To
allow a conviction in this test case was impos-
sible. No loyal bench of magistrates could be
expected to burst up the sport of kings out of
respect for the law. So they got out of the
difficulty by saying they were not satisfied that
Messrs. Frail had a guilty knowledge of
betting being perpetrated in their rings, there-
fore, the case was dismissed. The Northamp-
ton beaks were neither better nor worse than
our Australian “ authorities,” .who, from time
to time object to the appearance of a book-
maker’s advt. in a newspaper which is allowed
to record his transactions in a special para-
graph. The Law, in its dealings with turf
gambling is a whited sepulchre, a contemptible
humbug, and disgusting fraud, all the world
over. Its sin was bound to find it out, and this
Anti-Gambling League promises to expose the
rottenness of betting legislation in such a
glaring light that it will be forced to recon-
struct on sound, honest lines.
Concerning- some “Scandalous Rumors.”
Melbourne Age suggests that 12 months in
gaol and .£SOO fine would be a fitting reward
for people who circulate “ scandalous rumors”
about financial institutions, and urges, in
enthusiastic terms, that strong measures should
be adopted to “put down” this class of
offenders. The Bulletin can see, with its
mind’s eye, that “putting-down” process,
dating the event back a year or two. The
prisoner who expressed doubts about the
stability of one of'the shaky banks—say the
Federal—would be in the dock. The manager
and directors and auditors would all file in pro-
cession into the witness-box and testify to the
absolute stability of the institution, despite the
fact that its shares were falling with a heavier
thud every day—just as they testified before
the shareholders even when the collapse was in


other side, because the prisoner couldn’t get
free access to the books and securities, and
even if he could it would take 12 months’
hard work and an expenditure of several
thousand pounds to find out the real
state of affairs. Then he would be sentenced to
12 months in gaol, and sold up for the ,£SOO
fine, and just about the expiration of his sentence
the Federal would go bung and verify his pre-
dictions to the letter. But as the law which
the Age clamours for is only to apply to people
who circulate allegedly untrue reports to the
sight. There would he no evidence on the
effect that a financial institution is unsound
when it isn’t, and is to take no cognisance of
the leading citizen who circulates an untrue
statement to the effect that it is sound when it
isn’t, and thereby persuades people to drop their
money into his bottomless financial pit, the direc-
tors and auditors and so on wouldn’t be im-
prisoned for 12 months, or fined £SOO, or any-
thing even distantly resembling it. What the
Age seemingly wants, in fact, is that no man
shall be allowed, under an enormous penalty, to
warn anybody else against any rotten financial
institution, or to call in question any fraudu-
lent or suspicious-looking balance-sheet, or to
make himself uncomfortable to the board in
any way whatever. That is apparently all the
Age wants at present.
Passing* on the Responsibility.
N.S.W. Premier Reid’s latest defence of his loan
estimates —in which large sums are to be bor-
rowed for dredging rivers and makingsewers and
other sundries—is an interesting essay on the
great art of leaving the bill to the next genera-
tion, and shoving along the responsibility. “lb
would,” says Reid, “be grossly unfair to
charge the revenue of one particular year with
the expense of works whose utility would
extend over a period of from 30 years to a
century. By an annual contribution from the
revenue, something like a fair distribution of
the cost could be effected.” This theory might
hold good if these works were the only ones of
their kind which were wanted—but they are
not. Next year more rivers will want to be
dredged, and more sewers will be required, and
the invoice for them will be shunted on to
futurity for the same reason. And the same
thing will happen the year after, and the year
after that again, and the succeeding year, and
every other year while the country endures.
There is no end to the process, and every time,
accordingto G. Reid’s logic, there will be the
same reason for passing on the Bill to posterity.
And when at last posterity has to meet the
bill—for every bill must be either met or re-
pudiated sooner or later—the land revenue,
which at present amounts to £2,200,000 per
annum, will have been eaten up, and the
unpaid-for works will have become old and
decrepit. New South Wales lives just now
by using up the public lands as fast as they
can be realised upon, and leaving the bills
for ordinary current expenditure to be paid by
coming generations. And the country hasn’t
grown one statesman with sufficient pluck or
honesty to look the inevitable result in the
face.
The New South Wales Government announces
that the contracts for thinning out forests—on
which £25,000 of borrowed money is to be
expended—will be let only to persons who have
been at least six months resident in the pro-
vince. Considering that the Reid Government
is a strictly Free-raid institution this lapse into
Protection of the most uncompromising type is
remarkable. There is to be no free competition
about the business. It isn’t to be done in the
cheapest market. G. H. Reid doesn’t even
propose to content himself by letting the out-
side laborer compete under a 10 per cent,
duty as Dibbs did—he is to be shut
out altogether. For want of competition the
price will be raised to the consumer, who will
thus be taxed to keep up an artificial rate of
wages, and to foster an industry which doesn’t
live on its own merits. This is the exact mean-
ing of G. Reid’s action when put into the words
which G. Reid has himself used on a hundred
platforms when he pointed the podgy finger of
scorn at his predecessor. All the same, The
Bulletin is glad to find that Premier Reid,
when put to the test, isn’t heartless enough to
live up to his own brutal creed, and the fact
that he should still regard himself as an un-
compromising Freetrader, while practising
Protection in its most advanced form, only
shows that his brains are by no means
so good as his intentions. If the Reid
Government can make it square with its fiscal
policy to decree that the New South Wales
forests shall be thinned only by people who
have lived at least six months in the province,
then it can also decree that the hats and clothes
and boots of New South Wales shall only be
made by men who have resided at least six
months in the province, and square that with
its fiscal policy also. In fact, its fiscal policy
seems capable of squaring with so many things
that the Reid-Dibbs coalition ought to be
getting almost in sight by this time.
A teetotal priest, lecturing in Melbourne on
the Drinking Habits of Colonial Society, in-
formed his Christian friends that young Aus-
tralians were as liable to get drunk as their
British - born parents. This he gave as a
deplorable fact, without having the least
apparent suspicion that he was guilty of an
Impardonable lie. Comparative temperance in
strong-liquor drinking is already an Australian
virtue. The native of the not distant future
will be at least as sober as the average French-
man who contents himself with a happy hilarity
on vin ordinaire, and it is perhaps the
vague dread of this good time coming
which moves every rabid anti-alcoholist to
rear himself upon his hind legs and wave his bit
of blue ribbon. Strange to say, the temper-
ance tarradiddler in this case took his shocking
examples from among the babies at the Chil-
dren s Hospital in Paris. Many of these suck-
lings, the worthy man declared, would decline
milk, but “ imbibe with avidity anything which
contained alcohol, thus showing their hereditary
disposition to intemperance.” The point of
tins remark lay in the apostle’s application of
it, of course. All infants are tainted with a
liking for alcohol. If his own babbling off-
spring were offered the choice between pure
milk from the cow and a little weak brandy
and water, they would go bald-headed for the
“booze.” Which proves that teetotalism is
against nature.
Thus George Higinbotham on Vic. Legislative
Council :
The root idea of these Legislative Councils is that they
represent wealth. They assume that a man who is rich
is, by virtue of his riches, a better man and is better en-
titled to political power than a man who is not rich, and
they assume that the wealthy class is, by virtue of its
wealth, bi tter entitled to political power than the poor
class ; and that it is not merely entitled to more political
power as electors, but that it is entitled to predominant
power by having a separate chamber to represent wealth.
To my mind a mere statement of the proposition
amounts to a condemnation of the system. ... It
seems to me shameful that a man should tell me that he
is better than I am because he is richer than I am.
The Legislative Council has shown an indisposition and
an inaptitude, even an incapacity, to deal with any public
question whatever except those subjects connected with
wealth and the interests of the wealthy class. ... It
you looked into it I believe that members of the Legisla-
tive Assembly would have been found most injuriously
affected by the influences arising from Ihe existence of
the Legislative Council. lam afraid that the Legislative
Assembly has to a considerable extent been demoralised
by that body, and I am afraid, if I may be permitted to
say so, the people of this country have not escaped with
impunity from that contaminating influence.
My opinion—and if I had the power to carry out that
opinion I would do so —is to do away with the Legislative
Council altogether. In my opinion it is not, nor it cannot
come to good. The institution ifself is vicious in prin-
ciple, and does not admit of a satisfactory and complete
cure. . , It appears to me that no change will be re-
form in the real sense of that word unless it be a oha n ge
in the direction of weakening, and not of strengthening it.
. . . If there are two chambers you must have one
superior to the other ; and I take it that if you assent to
that view you will go with me further to this extent, that
the chamber which ought to be predominant is the cham-
ber which represents the whole people, and not the cham-
ber which represents only a section.
I have seen it stated, and with some sign of triumph,
that the people of this country are indifferent upon the
question ; that they feel no interest in it, and that it will
be a matter of indifference to them whether the Council
or the Assembly gain the victory in the conflict which
now exists and has existed for years. If this statement
be true, I would say, so much the worse for the people of
this country.
Editor Bulletin.—
Prices of Australian produce have diminished so greatly
in recent years that the burden of interest on the New
South Wales loans floated between 1872 and 1891 has
already increased, in effect, from £1,600,000 to £2,300,000
annually.
This is the old “ appreciation-of-gold ” question
—which I understood to be tabooed. I am
against the present National Debt want of sys-
tem, but not for the reason urged in your par.
above clipped from. “ The fall in prices ”is a
vast and complicated question, but I think that
few of Australia’s difficulties come therefrom.
Australia’s trouble, almost from first to last,
has been land-monopoly the habit of
the land - monopolist being to become
everybody’s rapacious creditor in good
times, and everybody’s insolvent debtor
in bad times. But, nevertheless, Australia’s
Loan Impolicy wants attention. Consolidation
would effect a tremendous saving offhand—and
a State Bank would get a lot of State 1.0.U.’s
out of pawn. Two further points to be urged ;
1. Commercial rates of interests are too high for bor-
rowers that have not the corifmeroial privilege of iusol-
vency when adversity comes.
2. No community has a lien on posterity.
To return to the tabooed subject : What are
the advantages of invention and organisation
and mechanical advance and industrial science,
and revolutionised transport, and all the rest of
the characteristics of the times—if they do not
cheapen anything ? Is steam to be developed
almost to an intelligence and then achieve
nothing? It is impossible that steam and the
dozen forces of the day should not tend to
lower the market prices of both luxuries and
necessaries. The “Prices of Produce ” argu-
ment against interest reckoned in gold should
include proof that produce is a fair criterion
or standard of value. The argument that in-
terest should drop with produce would have to
be applied to Wages—and I, for one, am not
prepared to admit that wages should oscillate
with corn—as if man lived by bread alone.
The fault is with the principle of loans—not the
interest.—F. [ (1) When a country has to pay
a fixed debt with produce that is steadily
declining in value, how can produce help being
a fair criterion ? (2) The Bulletin never said that
interest should drop with the price of produce.
If interest did, then it would follow that the
principal should drop also. (3) If The Bulle-
tin had said so, still it doesn’t follow that
wages should drop also. (4) “ The fault is with
the principle of loans—not the interest.”
Which is exactly what The Bulletin said.
Why should “ F.” argue at such length and so
indignantly to prove that he agrees with this
paper ?—Ed. B.]
Organs of the well-to-do scornfully point out
that whereas the working shearer makes an
average of a bare pound a week the Secretary
of the Australian Workers’ Union makes a fixed
.£2OO a year, and delegates to one or other of
the frequently-recurring conferences receive
15s. a day. The first thing the figures show is,
not that secretary or delegates get too much,
but that the working shearer gets too little. Yet
the proportion of remuneration between the
workers and the governing body in the shearer
sphere contrasts favorably with the propor-
tion in the case of State workers and governors.
A postman gets £2 10s. per week, or, say, £lO
a month; a postmaster-general gets £125 a
month. Where the postmaster-general gets
less, the postman also gets less. So right
throughout the State. This wrong-headed
jibe against salaried officials when Labor tries
to organise its resources stultifies its origin-
ators. The head of a large union works
as hard as a Minister of the Crown, and
needs to be endowed with qualities, less
showy perhaps, but quite as solid. The spec-
tacle of the Labor man jeered for taking £3 or
£4 a week, while the State employe receives
about £3O, is an exemplification of Law’n’order
with a very big beam in its eye.
Editor Bulletin, —Not with the object of
dragging the mangled “ W. W.” from beneath
the chariot-wheels of your thundering “ Aus-
tralian ” do I venture to point out to that
“ robustious ” Democrat that, in predicating
the acceptableness of good taste as the “ oil of
intercourse,” he predicates also, of necessity,
the undesirableness of its opposite. With this
much premised, however, let me vociferate in
“ Australian’s ” stentorian company that this
Queen-recognising question is of far too grimly
momentous a character to be referred to any
puny standard of conventional deportment. If
Anthony Ogden, M.P., thought as “Aus-
tralian ” thinks ; if he saw all in that libatory
glass of fizz that “ Australian ” makes him see ;
if he were, in truth, “the one erect man in a
crawling assembly ” —then, indeed, “ his small
refusal covers a great principle,” and “ Aus-
tralian’s ” volcanic screeches will not be as the
voice of one crying in the wilderness. But alas! I
am constitutionally suspicious of the man who is
eager to run his head against a brick wall.
Experience has taught me that blatant inde-
pendence is mostly sham independence, and my
proud enthusiasm flops suddenly to earth at
the reflection that in all probability it was not
that Ogden loved monarchy less, but that he
loved the pointed finger more, and that, in the
beaker which he heroically declined to drain to
the health of a commonplace and unimportant
old lady, he saw no nobler vision than the
chance of a little cheap notoriety for one
Anthony Ogden.—-Cosmopolitan.
Says a London paper :—
Men like Sir Wilfred Lawson and other prominen
fanatics are simply teetotal parasites of the drink traffic.
Politically they live by it and upon it, but they by no
means wish that there should be nothing left to blaze at.
The grand obstacle to national reform is the existence of
a great body of professional publican-hunters who draw
either cash or notoriety from the sport, and naturally
conduct it, not in the way that is best fitted to promote
temperance, but in the best way fitted to provide what
they want.
This is a matter worth considering. The men
who live by the liquor-traffic are brewers, dis-
tillers, publicans, and teetotal lecturers—the
teetotal lecturer lives by drink and upon the
accursed drink-traffic quite as much as does the
publican or the distiller. The abolition of
drink would deprive him of his only means of
livelihood just as effectually as it would the
publican, therefore he has just the same reason
for desiring that drink shall not be abolished.
Consequently, he demands entire prohibition,
which experience has proved to -be practically
impossible, instead of State control which is
possible, and which is twenty times more
effective than prohibition. He insists, ostensibly
on high moral grounds, on having all or nothing,
with a gratifying assurance that, as the result
of this policy, the drink-traffic will go on during
his lifetime, and his billet will last as long as he
wants it. The teetotal agitator who lives on the
game, or adds to his importance by it, is one of
the most serious obstacles in the way of any
effectual reform of the fusel-oil industry.
♦
Bernard Shaw, the dramatic critic and Fabian
essayist, talks straight to the social-gimlet
people in a recent P.M. Gazette :—
My scepticism as to the fate of ordinary woman on the
streets does not affect the damning fact that if a poor
girl, either by chance or by illegitimate inheritance from
a gentleman father, is pretty and ladylike, it is better for
her to trust to the protection of some rich and tolerably
kind man of the upper classes than to place herself at the
disposal of modern capitalism as a barmaid, a whitelead
worker, a sempstress, a match girl, or half-a-dozen of the
other alternatives offered by us to women as the reward
of virtue. It cannot be too clearly understood that it is
not the foolishly open-handed young gentlemen of the
Empire lounge who cheapen women. It is our pious
shareholders who use them up by the thousand, and who
make them into most ugly living pictures of premature
old age, clad in miserable garments that have an inde-
cency far more disgraceful to us than the rosy nothings
worn by the more fortunate living pictures at the music-
halls.
Mr. Shaw goes on to point out that marriage to
a poor girl in London simply means living
indecently in one room with a man legally
licensed to abuse her as no frequenter of the
Empire dare abuse a prostitute, and that, too,
without her consent, and possibly in the pre-
sence of her children.
An English Judge, who also happens to be a
large landowner, recently favored his tenants
and agricultural menials with a few political
remarks. Judges are not expected to give
themselves away, even at remote rural gather-
ings, but Justice Grantham had probably been
drinking to the health of next year’s crops in
home-brewed beer, and he talked recklessly.
He was severe on the Rosebery Government.
“Many of its supporters,” he said, referring to
the accursed democrats, “ do all they can to
injure the landowners, and to set class against
class, and it owes its position to the ill-will
which exists in some districts between the
farmer and his laborer.” The spectacle of a
calm, impartial lawgiver lamenting the fact
that a shilling-a-day laborer doesn’t whoop
for “ the squire ” as he was wont to
whoop is truly edifying. As Grantham so
candidly suggests, there would be no Radicals in
Parliament, nor any legislation save blue-Tory
legislation for the “masses,” if nobody came
along and urged them to vote against the land-
owners and their nominees. Then Hingland
would be happy. God has created two classes,
the landowners, including capitalists of all des-
criptions, and the other class, the class with no
land, or money, or individual influence w'orth
mentioning. The grand old duty of the class on
top is to remain on top in the grand old style of
yore, and the darned agitating democrat, who
attempts to “ injure ” the uppermost party, is
an enemy to Law’norder.
Purgatory must be worse than hell. It's
full of “ the middle-classes.”
Now and than he contrives to tell a tale quite in the
manner of Maupassant—without a touch in excess, with-
out a sign of strain. Lord Pembroke, in a delightful
introduction, properly calls- these stories powerful. To
our mind they are almost models of form for the short
story. Without any pretence of aiming at the more
elaborate effects, Mr. Becke almost always manages to
write with the pen of a master of his craft. The details
are admirable, the picture always holds the eye, now and
again with a rare and subtle charm.
The Chronicle concludes by saying that, true or
fictional, Becke’s stories “make genuine litera-
ture, human documents quite as notable as Zola
or Tourgenieff ever modelled into life-like
semblance.” And, in the big Australian dailies,
these same stories were damned with half-a-dozen
lines of faint praise or incompetent criticism !
Louis Becke’s clever Bulletin stories,
By Reef and Palm,” only published in London
and America on 26th Oct., had, by 10th Nov.,
gone into a second edition. No Australian writer
since Marcus Clarke has ever got such cordial
British press-notices as Becke. For instance, the

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
January 8, 1895.
AI v Dear Moorabinda—
Are women changing their spots? A lady
writes to the Sydney papers condemning the tall-
hatted medical brigade and wildly championing
the cause of the unregistered healer —and, as a
consequence, also that of the mysterious beldame
who cures cork legs with a sprig of greenstuff and
tells fortunes in between when she isn’t before the
court charged with reducing the rate of popula-
tion. There can be no manner of doubt that the
bolus instinct is born in some folk —like piano-
playing and pocket-picking—and that some un-
registered people are gifted with a keener medical
instinct than many qualified practitioners who
merely fire drugs into a body on the off-chance
that some of them will do the trick.
But, yet, why should every other inherent taste
for a given pursuit need sedulous cultivation be-
fore it can come to the surface? An untaught
artist, an uncultivated singer, have absolutely no
value in the open market, strong though their
natural vocation may bo ; why then should it be
asserted that the “qualified” medical practitioner
is laps behind the Heaven-sent natural genius, with
half-mourning nails, who goes tinkering around
one’s vitals by rule of thumb ?
I don’t think the quack’s latest championess, a
lady with a luxuriant literary style who has long
been pecking at the doctors, can have studied her
fellow-women very intelligently, for, after triumph-
antly quoting a most in-and-out sort of female
who consulted a “ regular ” medico only to throw
his medicines into the fire and take the doses of
her pet herbalist (often a most equivocal term !)
who “ soon put her right,” the championess of
back-alley science goes on to rejoice over an
alleged clue “ leading away from mystery . . .
to simplicity and freedom.” However, I don’t
think many women will appreciate the change.
“Mystery ” is the very breath of life to my poor,
dear sisters. When a lady has over-eaten (or
drunk) it is much more soothing to her feelings to
be sympathised with in dog-Latin than to come
home brutally labelled “ awful result of too much
chicken and champagne.”
Some of the letters printed re the latest Tich-
borne-claimant dog-days sensation make charming
reading, the most high-toned epistle I have read
for a whole year being the effusion of one “John
Seult Fortescue le Clere,” who tells of meeting
one whom he considers to be the only genuine
Tichborne, while he (John Seult, &c.) was chop-
ping wood for Murray River steamers —a noble
instance of blue-blood making itself useful at the
end of an axe. Here is a slab of his communica-
tion, worthy of note by all aspirants to melo-
dramatic honors ; "We recognised each other by
ancestral rings his with the family crest,
mine with the family motto of the Fortes-
cues (Forte scutum satus ducem). He showed
me documents of great importance that
I am forbidden on oath to reveal.”
Hasn’t that a good old Bland-Holtian sound ?
The hero of a stage-drama always travels about
with the jewellery his mother gave him, although
his boots look like dismantled roller-skates, and he
is invariably studded with valuable “papers”
which the villain gets hold of in the simplest
manner possible. This I have always considered
a weak situation in an age of iron safes. But now
I will regard that hero with more toleration when
he sits down alone and unprotected and proceeds
to turn out all his pockets for the edification of a
total stranger. The only melodramatic touch in
John Seult Fortescue Le Clere’s romantic narra-
tive is that his Tichborne was discovered headless
later on. I hope budding dramatists will make a
note of that, also; for a melodramatic hero who
expires in real earnest and gives the heroine
another chance should be most refreshing.
The Australasian (it now unblushingly hurls
itself at your head as a “ society ” paper and
chronicles the fact that “ Miss Smith looked nice,
as usual ”) broke out, the other day, with a page
full of Sydney society beauties —a proceeding cal-
culated to do more damage to the prospects of a
passably-pretty girl than if it held her up to public
scorn as a hopeless scarecrow. The page of
alleged Sydney loveliness is, however, incomplete
in that the portrait of the lady whom all the Sydney
clubs vote the belle of the heap (and the clubs are
final authority on these questions) is not given—a
circumstance that should be balm to the soul of
that popular, dark-eyed matron, if there is any
truth in the ancient statement that “good wine
needs no bush.”
The solemn Australasian, I ought to remark,
doesn’t say these ladies are beauties in so many
words, but it obviously thinks so ; else why choose
fifteen women out of the accepted social one
hundred made familiar to us by the Ladies’
Club, leaving the eighty-five out in the cold to
gnash their shop-teeth in envy ? Still, I don’t
think the Southern weekly has thrown much of a
discordant apple into the Port Jackson social
camp. Three of the ladies are calmly and frankly
ugly. The chief beauty of one lies in her pretty
hair, and that, of course, isn’t appreciated in a
photo., which only shows how sketchy her brows
and eyebrows are, and another whose shoulders
are her strong point is really no prettier facially
than I am (as seen at the top of these remarks).
The sublime ignorance that is going to be
fashionable in a day of State schools and Italian
one penny per lesson, appears to have broken out
already in one decorous and seldom-heard-of
ladies’ club. The lady secretary sent out a
circular to the members on some burning question
or other, a month or so ago, and up to now none
of the club-women have the murkiest idea what it
was all about. The bird’s-eye effect of the circular
was as if the secretary had made a bold sketch, in
blue ink, of a Chinese washing-bill, and then sat
down on it absent-mindedly while it was wet.
I don’t know whether to believe the storyette
re the —er —thrift of an enormously wealthy lady
much-advertised as a philanthropist, who once
upon a time undertook to help at a refreshment-
stall at a certain suburban sectarian bazaar. As
the affair was very “class,” a rush of deadheads
was confidently expected, and so a smart boy
was set to mind the door and admit nobody
on the nod who had not a badge or card
of invitation. The first to arrive was Miss
Van Kilmansegg, who, conscious of her fell
purpose as elected retailer of bazaar-pastry,
naturally thought to float past the door-keeper
with the usual supercilious smile; but Cerberus
had been too well drilled to allow that sort of
thing, and, seeing no badge, stopped her with a
modest request for a shilling. “I am going to
help Lady Dash,” gasped the heiress, “ but I have
forgotten my badge. Surely you know me—Miss
Kilmansegg ?” Casablanca, however, was a mere
stupid frivoller compared with that doorkeeper,
and it was only after long and heated argument
that an undoubted authority turned tip, identified
the gilded one as a helper, and passed her out of
the hot sun, where she had long grilled rather
than pay 12 pence at the door ! But how a big
fortune is wasted on a person with such economi-
cal proclivities! That is the sort of individual
who is quite capable of beginning life on a Tommy
Dodd sixpence and ending up on Turkey carpets.
Hovv_ seldom loveliness and lucre go together
except in fiction ! In real life, directly people grab
gold their complexions seem to turn yellow as if in
compliment. The Coolgardie gold-diggers are
said to be turning either unaccountably grey or as
bald as eggs—afflictions variously alleged to be
the results of dust, tinned meats, condensed water,
wear and tear of camel exercise, and scarcity of
soap-and-water. But, to whatever they may be
due, I can’t help regarding them as the best gold-
omens imaginable. Here, in the East, girls notice
that baldness and Plutonic wealth are inseparable.
The reception given by the Equitable Life As-
surance Society of Ihe US. to celebrate the for-
mal opening of its magnificent new offices was
an emphatic success. Sydney is the most promis-
ing city in the world in which to give free enter-
tainments, and the flocks of people on the lovely
marble staircases were like a modern version
of the well-patronised ladder about which Jacob
dreamed.
The noble-fronted Equitable is certainly a
gorgeous palace, with acres of marble floors, reck-
less flights of marble stairways, and a prevailing
tone of grey and gold (and not too much gold,
either) that turns the vyhole building into a sym-
phony. Even the officials’ uniforms are West-
Point grey, with silver buttons. I must confess
to open-mouthed admiration of the whole edifice,
which is probably the only Australian building
likely to last long enough to become more or less
historical ruins when Macaulay’s Maorilander
stalks abroad; and yet it has a light and airy
aspect. The lifts are of iron lace work, for
example, and the top roof, a good balloon-journey
from the pavement, is so fantastically treated that
it suggests a pantomime-transformation scene.
The reception was distinctly hilarious. There
were corks in the air, and when people tried to
lean in a graceful Piccadilly way on their walking-
sticks, quite oblivious for the moment of the pro-
verbial of marble floors, accidents
happened. Nearly all the good old inevitable in-
vitation-brigade turned up and talked all through

With what feelings their advent is noted, they

a wholesale invasion of people who have, on a
remote occasion, paid a fare for which they re-
ceived full value, is quite another thing.”

The resolve of the Reid Government to
postpone till S w pt. the repeal of the N.S.W. grain-
duties, raised the temperature of theParkes group
several degrees last week. The question canvassed
was—What effect would an amendment moved by
Parkes have if it- should affirm that the grain-
duties shall cease on the same date as other pro-
tective duties? Such an amendment would, or
should, be favored by straight-out Freetraders;
would probably capture most of the malcontents
in Reid’s camp ; and would obtain, on strategic
grounds, much support from the Protectionist
side. And if the amendment were carried by
such a combination, what would there remain for
the Reid Government to do ?
Grand Argus argument against Yic. Land-
tax Bill;
What would happen—Mr. Irvine and others may be
asked —to the members of the Municipal Council that
proposed to increase the rates off-hand by 50 to 100 per
cent. Not many of them would be returned to that
Council Chamber again.
If the municipality had an enormous accrued
deficit amounting to £3 per head for every man,
woman and child therein (as Victoria has) the
councillors would either have to raise the rates or
pay the deficit out of their own pockets. Which
would they do? The pity is that legislators have
the privilege of passing deficits on to next session
—and next Parliament, as actually advocated by
Argus —and next generation, as practised in
Queensland.
Daring the discussion in W.A. Parliament
on the proposal to increase the grant to R.O.
schools (warmly supported by Moran, member for
Yilgarn, and formerly teacher in a R.C. school at
Toowoomba, Q.), Illingworth produced a R.O.
school-book and read a number of extracts to show
that for educational purposes the existence of
Protestants was altogether ignored. A sample :
The state of religion in Australia is of the most cheering
character. Pope Gregory XVI. in 1835 sent thither the
first Archbishop of Sydney, accompanied by three priests
and four ecclesiastical students. Under the auspiois of
this estimable prelate Catholicity advanced with rapid
strides. In 1833 the Cal holies were estimated at one-
fifth ; now they are probably one-half of the population.
In Oceania there are 19 bishoprics, eight vicariates, one
apostolic prefect, and over 400 priests.
As, according to census-reports, the proportion of
R.O.’s in Australasia was 23.1 per cent, of the
population in 1871, and only 21.1 per cent, in 1891,
it seems that the W.A. assisted schools teach one
first-class lie, anyway.
Melbourne Argus, exhorting its friend,
Fat Man, to oppose a Land-tax on patriotic
grounds: “It is for the Legislative Council to
earn the public respect and confidence by a full
and anxious consideration of whether it should or
should not exercise in the people’s welfare the
suspensive veto with which the constitution clearly
entrusts it. The people’s welfare is the one con-
si ration.” Quite so.
A Sydney Sunday paper prints a yarn about
a handsome and attractive English lady fighting
and killing a shark at Chowder Point, Sydney.
The lady, the Honorable Mrs. Balk (probably
pronounced “Pork,” in the eternal fitness of
things), met “ a vicious monster of the
main in hand-to-hand combat ” and destroyed it
“like a professional.” Details of the fight, it is
true, hardly bear out the gigantic promise of the
headlines. The lady (accompanied by two men,
who “ left it all to her ”) proceeded to kill a shark
which had been hooked at a bait-buoy. The boat
rolled about, but she harpooned him—“she had
no scruples about that.” It was difficult to stand
up, but “somehow she was quite cool and col-
lected.” The shark came to the surface
and opened his mouth at her, and then
she let him have the harpoon in the
neck; then he came up again and made
more faces. The look of ferocity in his eye
“ gave her quite a chill, but only for a moment.
She hardly knew what she was doing, but she
struck him across the eye with her hand and ex-
claimed ‘You brute!’” Shortly after that, of
course, he died. Then there is some more about
the lady poising a 20-ft. lance and reddening the
sea for 20 yards round. Also, “ part of the lady’s
garments were destroyed in the struggle.” The
Bulletin presumes that it is all an allegory—that
the shark was Man and the lance Woman-suffrage.
But if (Allah be praised!) ibis all literally true, then
t lie man-eating shark has at last found his match—
in the New Woman.
“ Shall our veto be suspensive ?”
Asks the Fat Man, sad and pensive,
“ Are the people to this bill inclined ?
Will it please the lower classes
If the Council promptly passes
Any measure that is ‘ ill-designed V
Would the impost on the soil
Raise the dignity of toil?
Would the farmer, lean and poor—
Ah ! the wolf is at the door—
Like to see his mortgagee thus ‘ fined?’
Would a tax give bread and meat
To the starvers in the street ?
We would gladly pay, ahem !
But we must not injure them:
And so, there’s not a doubt,
We must throw the measure out
In the interests of humankind 1”
The welfare of the nation
Is the one consideration
Ever foremost in the Fat Man’s mind.

The full balance-sheet of the London Bank of
Australia presents all the main features foreshadowed in
the cabled summary. The principal of these is that the
total profit for the half-year is £7020, which is equal to a
little over 1 per cent, per annum on the paid-up capital
of £1,315,000. This circumstance is doubtless a bad thing
for the London Bank of Australia, but it is a good thing
for Australia in general. The London Bank is one of the
hundred or more institutions which make profits in Aus-
tralia and ship them away to pay divs. in England—it is
one more among the vast army of absentees—and, there-
fore, the less profitit makes in this country the better for
the country. The same statement applies to the Union,
the Australasia, and the E.S. and A. Bank, and a horde
of smaller financial institutions. Australia is overrun
worse than any other country on this earth with foreign
joint-stock financiers, and any Protectionist who keeps
his account in an English bank, or insures his property
with an English office, or entrusts his business to an
English finance, mortgage, loan or ot her co., is hereby
informed that he doesn’t know the meaning of his own
principles.

The liquidator of the onoe-famous, bub now
almost forgotten, Premier Permanent Building Society
issues a balance-sheet showing the results of 4J years’
liquidation. Considering the vastness of the figures in-
volved, and the awful bewilderment of the accounts, it
appears that there is, after all, very little reason in the
complaints made about the delay in declaring a div.
During the period in question, £563,000 was collected,
and even this amount was not sufficient to pay off the
mortgages on the society’s properties, and over £200,000
had to be borrowed in order to satisfy pressing claims,
and prevent the whole assets being foreclosed upon in one
act by some large and ferocious creditors. The situation
at the time of the suspension seems to have been some
thing surpassing the wildest nightmares of finance.
Every separate item of the society’s properties
was mortgaged, often in several directions. A large num-
ber of its buildings were unfinished, or half-finished, or
only just begun, and those which had any value had to
be completed by the liquidator in order to render them
saleable. Many of the lands had dubious titles which had
to be patched up, and in some cases, owing to defective
surveys, damages had to be paid to adjacent proprietors
whose ground had been encroached upon. Also, a large
number had been bought on the instalment plan and
were only partly paid for. The present situation, after
years of bewilderment, is that the society has
£879,000 worth of nominal assets left on hand, and if
these yield £300,000 in cash—whioh is all that is ejected
—the depositors will receive between ss. and 6s. in the £.
Therefore.it is evident that the would-be shaiks, who
bought up Premier Permanent deposits at 14s. in the £
during the early days of the liquidation, will be very
badly left indeed. About three-fourths of the mortgagers
who held the society in pawn have now been either paid,
or ohnked-off, or otherwise disposed of, and when the
balance—whose claims amount to £ls6,ooo—have been
settled with, the depositors will begin to have a show.
Consequently, the latter class may expect a first div. in a
year or two or three, or at the beginning of next century,
or thereabouts, more or less.

Under the Maoriland Foreign Insurance Com-
panies Act, no foreign fire or marine co. can operate in
Maoriland unless it flist obtains from the Public Trustee
a certificate of solvency. That miserable official now
awakes to the fact that he can’t go all round the world
auditing the accounts of the different foreign companies.
Therefore, he must either grant a certificate to every co.
because it says it is solvent, or else refuse the certificates
all round on the ground that he knows nothing about the
alleged solvency of any foreign co.
* • * *
The pastoral properties which the Maoriland
Government resumed at the land-tax valuation and
leased in small areas to settlers, paid last year 4} per cent,
on their cost to the State. As the purchase-money was
raised at 4 per cent, and has since been mostly paid off
out of revenue, there is a solid profit on the transaction.
N.S. Wales badly wants a Government which will attack
after the same fashion the unoccupied lands in the
Eastern Division, which are held by speculators for a rise.
There is room on these lands to grow all the agricultural
produce which the province wants this century, and when
they are fully occupied it will be time enough to talk
about opening the regions beyond the mountains.

The old Balmain Steam Ferry Co. is about the
mostoheerfulinstance of a crushed monopoly thatTuß Bul-
letin is aware of. Balmain, a “ working-man’s suburb,”
is one of the most populous in Sydney; and the ferry-
boats to and from the city carry thousands of passengers
daily. Two or three years ago the whole trade was in the
hands of what is now called “the old c 0.,” which
charged a cash fare of 3d. for 7 to 15 min. journey, with
weekly and monthly tickets in proportion. Many appeals
were made for a reduction of rates; but the directors,
strong in monopoly, hardened their hearts and gave a
short and haughty answer to every plea for mercy. Then
the desperate Balmainiacs started a co-operative steam
ferry, called the Balmain New Ferry Co., amid the jeers
of the old oo.’s supporters, who prophesied speedy failure.
But every hard-working artisan who had groaned under
the old co.’s tariff took a share or two in the new
venture, and stuck to it, and persuaded his friends to
stick to it, and often walked a long distance round to it
in order to avoid travelling by the old co.’s boats; and
the old co.’s trade on one route fell away to nothing
instanter. Then it reduced its fares below the Id.
which the new co. charged ; but the workmen stuck
together like wax and were supported by everybody in
Balmain who understood the value of opposition. The
consequence now is that the new co. is making money
handover fist, while the old one is as continuously losing
it, and meets next week to decide whether it will throw
up the sponge altogether. As an example of successful
co-operation, the Balmain New Ferry Co. is worth

A weird and wonderfully circuitous scheme of
bank-amalgamation is proposed in Melbourne. The idea
is to slump together the liquid business and available cash
of five local institutions—the National, Victoria, Colonial,
City of Melbourne, and Commercial of Australia—and
make one vast concern, to be called the Cnnsolidat d Bank
of Victoria. Then the dead business, the unsaleable lands,
unrealisable overdrafts, had debts, and all the miscel-
laneous securities for which there is no market, are to he
lumped together into another concern to be called the
Consolidated Securities Corporation. The bank would
thus have some £13,000,000 in liquid assets and cash, and
would become responsible for £7,000,000 of new current
accounts and other liabilities; while the Corporation
would have all the heavy and unmarketable assets, and
would be responsible for the reconstructed deposits
amounting to i2l 000,000 or more. 'I hen the worst part
of the confusion begins. The Corporation is to hold, for
the time, all the shares of the bank as additional security
for the reconstructed depositors. The preference share-
holders of the existing hanks are to give up their shares
and get instead 5 per cent, shares of the Corporation
—the thing with all the dead assets in it. The
ordinary shareholders of the existing hanks are to give up
their shares and receive instead ordinary shares in the
Corporation ; so that the same old crowd of shareholder
will own the S' curities Corporation, and the Corporation
will own the Consolidated Bank. This being fixed up the
reconstructed depositors come in, and the confusion gets
worse.
The bank, which is owned by the Corporation,
is to issue to the Corporation in part payment of the re-
constructed deposits, £3,000,000 in 3 per cent, consols.
The balance of the “ fixed ” deposits are to be paid, one-
half in “maximum 3 per cent, preferred debentures,”
payable in 25 years, and one-half in “maximum 3£ per
cent, debentures” which are not to be paid at all hut are lo
go on for ever. Further, the reconstructed depositors are
to receive a cash bonus of 6 per cent, as an inducement,
and an attempt is to be made to persuade Govt, to
guarantee the 3 per cent, perpetual debentures. The
result of all this learned and elaborate hash is that the
reconstructed depositor is to get an average of 3Jper cent.


STRAIGHT TIP.
Drink like a fish—water only. Smoke like know-
ing ones—Cavour’s only. This is sound and good
advice. Neither water nor Oavour cigars will ever
hurt you ; both are pure and cost little. Cavour’s
are mild and aromatic. May be had at eight for
a shilling. Get them—the sooner the better.
Delay is a fitter.
Instead of the present 4J ; that he is to have the
dead assets as his security, instead of the whole resources
of the hanks ; that the two reasonably good banks are to
combine on even terms with the three dubious ones ; that
calls are to stop—for the present, anyhow ; and that there
will be a state of frantic confusion in which nobody will
know “ where he are."
Meanwhile, City of Melbourne Bank deposits
have no buyers above 65., and sellers are quite willing to
take Bs., therefore, whatever is to be done in this par-
ticular case looks as if it would need to be done quickly.
If tiie Vic. Government offered 2 per cent, debentures to
the fixed depositors of this institution the chances are, in
the present state of things, that the offer would be cheer-
fully accepted. Then the State could charge the bank
2J per cent., and thus make a handsome profit in the
transaction, and could take over the entire control until
the poor little concern is once more on its feet. Even
the City of Melbourne would get through on such terms
as these, with a State guarantee behind it. There is
a fine chance for a hard and enterprising Scotch financier
to distinguish himself at the Vic. Treasury, just now.
* • • •
Next time, and every other time, that an Aus-
tralian Government issues a local loan it should be
enacted that the dividends thereon shall be subject to an
absentee-tax of 25 per cent. As a solid guarantee against
the debentures drifting into the hands of the inevitable
J. Bull, and helping to take more interest out of the
country, this simple device would be wonderfully effec-
tive. J. Bull could have Che debentures if he liked to buy
them, but instead of £3 10s. per cent, interest he would
only get £2 12s. 6d., which would make all the difference.

The liquidator of the Land Co. of Australasia
reports that one of the mysteries of that truly remark-
able institution was the loss of £B5OO in the notorious
Last Call gold-mine. The amount appeared in the books
first as owing by one of the directors, and then after a
while it was written off among the losses, and disappeared.
Whether the director was speculating in mining shares on
the company’s account, or whether he speculated on his
own account and charged his losses to the 00., isn’t ex-
plained. Anyhow, the shareholders should hunt up this
director, and take a firm hojd of him, and not let go until
the matter is fully explained. Another of the Land Co.’s
troubles was an "estate ” which it bought for £49,000.
It paid £27,000, and £6OOO in interest, and then let the
seller have the property back again, but now the land is
only valued at £7OOO, so the co. owes him another £15,000
and £2OOO for rnore’interest, in addition to losing the pro-
perty. In other words, it-buys a property for £49,000, and
has to pay £50,000 to induce the original owner to take it
back and keep it, and say nothing more about it. Look-
ing at lids fearsome transaction in all its aspects, The
Bulletin is of opinion that some “representative busi-
ness men ” have less brains than an ordinary lunatic. The
dire-tors who could fix up a £49,000 land-purchase so
that it became necessary to pay £50,000 to induce the
previous owner to keep tire properly, are individuals
whose capacity for tying themselves in a hard knot is
something sublime.

With reference to the rumors of the sale of
aydney’s biggest hotel which have found their way into
print, The Bulletin is assured, on the best authority,
that the gossip is absolutely unreliable. The hotel is not
forsale ; it lias been offered to no one ; no one has made
an offer for it; and the person who is mentioned as want-
ing to purchase is likely to continue to “ want.”

The Australian Temperance and General In-
surance Society reports that during the past year it has
issued 686 policies, yielding a premium income of about
£4OOO, and has added £22,798 to its funds. The Temper-
ance and General is an office which has existed and
silently petrified for 19 years. It never seemed to get
really afloat, and its whole accumulated funds, after 19
years of toil, would hardly make a year’s income for a
good second-flight society. Nobody seems to know the
cause of this state of tilings, except that the office has
been a poor, slow, little concern all the days of its life,
and has never been properly alive. Still, in its own small
way, judged on its own figures—and in the absence of a
State audit every society has to be judged on its own
figures—it seems to be moderately sound. Its expenses,
apart from its industrial business, are about 21 per cent,
of its entire income—a woefully high figure certainly, but
one that is by no means unprecedented. The item, " out-
standing and accrued interest,” represents about one-
third of the year’s revenue from investments. As it is
impossible to say how much of this is “outstanding ”
and how much is only “ accrued,” the soundness of the
investments is difficult to estimate, but they seem to be
reasonably good. The only serious objection to the Tem-
perance and General is its name and the fact that it is a
burlesque little institution which can hardly be regarded
seriously, and which takes itself very seriously all the
same. If it gave up taking itself seriously, and professed
to be a somewhat humorous institution, it would be a
great success.
The Temperance and General does not, how-
ever, represent the humblest aspect of Australian life
assurance business. A still smaller concern is the Vic-
toria General Life Co., which has an annual premium
income of £6877, just about as much as the A.M.P. society
collects in a day and a half. And right at the bottom of
the list comes the Adelaide Lite Co., which, after 28 years’
of existence, has a premium income of £lO3l per year
about a day’s income for the Colonial Mutual, or as much
as the A.M.P. Society collects in two working hours. This
u dque institution, when last heard of by this paper, had
117 policies in existence ; it spends 69J per cent, of its
premium income on working expenses, and has a total
fund of about £40,000. Probably not one person in a
thousand even knows of the existence of these quaint
little concerns which hang on to the extreme tail-end of
the life insurance industry in Australia. There isa sleepy,
restful, old-cobwebby aspect about them. They don’t
advertise much, or rush about and perspire in the effort
to acquire business, and tbeir dreamy existence is vaguely
suggestive of a hermit mooning in his grotto and letting
all the outer world slide.

Actuary Alsop, of Melb. Savings Bank, adversely
criticises the local P.O. Savings Bank. The P.O. Bank
will not take cheques, or any deposit that is not “even
shillings £1 Is. but not £1 Is. 6d. The P.O. Bank also
posts an acknowledgment of every deposit—which inter-
f -res with the privacy of the thing. But actuary Alsop
shouldn’t throw stones. Melb. Savings’ Bank’s system
is cumbrous and unnecessary. The pass-book must accom-
pany every lodgment and withdrawal. Thus, depositor
must do all his bank-work himself or else “give away”
Ibe state of his account to everyone who acts for him.
The popular idea is that these shackles are put on to
prevent tradespeople from using the bank for current
accounts.
Now, the frequent drawing of cheques on a
“savings”bank coni.l be stopped by regulation, if the bank
must stick to the letter of its name. By the irony of fact,
the Bank is now used for trade current accounts-and
persons with “givings” are frequently frightened away
by the ritual. In fact, Melb. Savings Bank is run for the
benefit of the “tlirifty” person who will each week under-
go all sorts of inconvenience for the sake of 7d. “interest”
in the half year. Melb. Savings Bank, viewed in the light
of its mortgages, is unsatisfactory ; and, in the light of
its ritual, is ridiculous. The sooner it makes way for the
State Bank the better.

Dear Bulletin, —Would it not pay to locally
manufacture sterling silver table-requisites, such as
spoons and forks ? The lowest price quoted in Sydney for
these goods is from 7s. to 7s, 6 1. per oz., and with silver
selling at less than 2s. 6d. per oz., there is a big profit
somewhere. The best electroplate can be bought for
about Is. 6d. per oz. taking the above goods at per doz.
As the cost of making a silver spoon should not exceed
the amount which will supply material, manufacture, and
furnish two or more profits, on an electroplate ditto, it
appears as if sterling silver goods could be sold profitably
at about ss. an oz.—Billycan.

ment, anyone unable to pay 20s. in the £to sequestrate
and become an ordinary insolvent. Abolish trustees,
have only official assignees who shall be assisted in wind-
ing up the estate by a committee of inspection elected at
a general meeting of creditors held seven days after filing
of the schedule ; such committee to receive no remunera-
tion. The assignee shall examine the insolvent within 14
days of filing of schedule, and ns often as 1 e thinks fit; a
report of every examination shall be submitted to the
Judge, who may order further examination by th“
assignee or in open court, and name a lawyer to aid if
necessary. All examinations to be public, and deposi-
tions to be taken in writing. The committee shall
also report to the Judge, and should any friction arise
with the assignee, the Judge shall be arbitrator and may
obtain expert assistance. Commission at 5 per cent, should
be charged on the gross amount realised, per cent, to
the assignee and the rest to the Govt. ; the assignee to be
held personally responsible for the probity of all his em-
ployes. All accounts to be approved and signed by com-
mittee and assignee, also subject to taxation. All credi-
tors to have free access to accounts, and rightof complaint
direct to the Judge. A bill on these lines would exter-
minate the expert and greedy swindlers to be found in the
ranks of the trade assignees, and cause consternation
amongst their satellites, the shady solicitors. Small
creditors could not then be coerced into accepting Id. in
the £ by majorities who are afraid to allow their blunders
to see the light; in fact, it would prevent,the Insolvency
Court being a chapel of ease, as it is at present to the

From 1493 to 1893, inclusive, the estimated
amount of gold and silver produced in the world was:
Gold, 406,223,949 fine oz. ; silver, 7,663,409,716 fine oz.
This is in the proportion of soz. of gold to 950 z. of silver,
and, strangely enough, this is very like the proportion in
which gold and silver were produced in '9l, '92, and ’93.
The totals for these three years vary verv much, but the
ratio of production is exactly the same "for the three—
namely, 4 - 4 oz. of gold to 95'60z. of silver, or 1 to 2173.
But the commercial ratio (price) has varied considerably :
’9l, 1 to 20-92 ; ’92, 1 to 2372 ; ’93, 1 to 26‘49. 1
Director R. E. Preston, of U.S.A. Mint, issues
a very optimistic estimate of the States’ gold-product for
’94. The ’93 product was 35,955.000d015.—but for the
past year a sum of 42 to 45 millions dollars is expected.
If the larger estimate be realised it will mean no less than
2,175,000 fine ounces—a total before which Australasia
may hide herdiminished head. The same authority quotes
38,000,000d015. for Australasia, which would mean 1,837,000
fine ounces, but recent local statistics do not induce The
Bulletin to desert its own figures, namelv, 2,065 000
ounces gross, or, say, 1,900,000 ounces fine. " ’
The African figures come next in importance.
Gold is produced to a small extent on the West Coast, as
well as to a large extent in the Transvaal. The West
Coast production is reckoned as the amount imported
thence by England, the figures for ’92 being 48 9520 z.
fine. The Randt out-put for Sept, was 176,7070 z., making
the total to that date 1,493,3730 z. The close of 1894
should therefore see a grand total of 2,030,0000 z. (crude),
the value of which is £3 12s. per oz. The balance of the
Transvaal would turn out, say, 120,0000 z. of the same
quality. The ’94 African product may therefore be put
thus in fine ounces:—
Randt 1,720,425
Rest of Transvaal .. .. 101,700
West Coast 50,000
1.872.125
“The world’s output of gold for ’93 was the largest in
history,” so says the U.S.A. Mint. It is now certain that
’94 will eclipse ’93.
Of the 7,523,0000 z. of gold produced in 1893,
4,883,0000 z. came from U.S.A., Africa, and Australasia—
leaving 2,640,000 for the rest of the world to produce.
The latter amount will be much increased for last
year, if only by the mining activity in South America—but
this increase can be left as a discount for optimism in
other directions.
The 1894 estimate for the world can, therefore,
be stated as follows:
U.S.A. .. .. .. 2,175,000
Australasia .. .. 1,900,000
Africa .. ... .. 1,872,125
Other countries .. .. 2,640,000
8.587.125
This view indicates an increase on the world’s previous
record for one year of about 1,064,0000 z., or £4,522,000.
The importance of these statistics to the cur-
rency tangles and theories of the day cannot be exag-
gerated—yet each party will consider them conclusive for
its own end. But let any old miner, who thinks that the
day of gold is past, contemplate the following comparison
of the days of the old rushes with to-day and yesterday :
Average world’s yield .. ’sl—’ss .. 6,410,324
» » .... ’s6—’6o ... 6,486,262
„ „ .. ’66—’7o „ 6,270.086

Total yield .. .. 1889 .. 5,973,780
.. .. 1893 .. 7,523,377
Estimate .. .. 1894 .. 8,587,125
This means that ’94 will produce much over 900 tons of
pure gold—or, more exactly, the equivalent of 36,500,000
golden sovereigns. This is the biggest century in gold-
mining, and ’94 is the biggest year of the century, so far.

The estimate of 670,5440 z. as the Yic. gold-yield
is based on the figures of the Vic. mining registrars. Yet
the amount of Vic. gold actually coined last year from
Jan. 1 to Dec. 31 was 739,4960 z. Naturally many small
amounts find their way to the banks which the registrars
never hear of.
The 4,166,874 new aovs. minted in Melbourne
last year are equal to a daily dole of 11,500 lor the year,
including Sundays.
During ’94, Sydney melted and re-coined
17,1400 z. of worn sovs. and half sovs.—nearly £67,000.
Melbourne only dealt with about £lOOO in the same way.
The gross value of gold handled by Sydney
Mint since its establishment in ’55 to 31st Dec. last, equals
£79,204,132, of which £3,084,778 was received in ’94. The
new sovs. and half-sovs. issued during the 49 years
totalled £76.072,000. of which less than £11,000,000
remain in N.S. W.
Melb. Mint finished ’94 with a record of
1,061,6230 z.— which easily surpasses the previous largest
turnover, namely, 946,9960 z. for '93. Barely 200,0000 z. of
Westralian gold went to Melb. in ’94.

Victorian coal output for 1894 was 176,918 tons.
This almost doubles.that for 1893, 91,726 tons; and is
nearly eight times th* total for 1892, 23,363 tons. Which
rapid increase of production is accompanied by a steady
decrease in the quantity imported from N.S. Wales,
—in ’9l, 954,277 tons ; in ’92, 879,068 tons; and in '93,
731,304 tons. In these figures the Newcastle colliers may
read one effective cause of slack employment.

Wyalong total yield to date is given as 40840 z,

that at one time there were said to be 10,000 on the
ground—there isn’t much in it. It pans out a div. of
£5 per man per annum. Call it 1500 men for six months,
and there’s only £2O per man per annum—not “ten bob a

Another call on the Kapai-Vermont shares—
another proof that between the estimated and real cost of
mining plants there is usually a big distinction, sometimes
attributable to ignorance and sometimes to deception.
Old Bendigo looks as if it might have a new
spurt in ’95. Last year showed a dreadful falling off, the
divs. (£125,000) being only half those of '93, and rather
less than half those of ’92. Within the last few weeks,
however, Lansell’s “180” mine has opened up a
reef at 3100 ft., and a crosscut at a depth of
900 ft. has discovered a promising lode lying
parallel with the great New Chum line, and some-
thing over 16ft. thick. If this pans out well, it ought to
give a new lease of life all along the New Chum line. The
New Chum Railway mine has also got a big and promising
formation at 2800 ft., and these discoveries look as if there
was another great future in front of Bendigo. The belief
that the reefs go right down to perdition or thereabouts
is beginning to revive, and the discovery of a forgotten
lode, only 400 ft. away from ihe New Chum line, makes
some sanguine spirits imagine that the gold deposits,
even in the upper regions, are only scratched after all. In
1877, 1879, and again in 1889, Bendigo suffered an even
worse drop than that of 1894, but in each case it had a
glorious resurrection and started afresh, and no one can

A. J. Wilson, of the Investor’s Review, dis-
charges some of his most hair-raising Billingsgate at the
crowd of Westralian boomers in London. If these mining
potentates don’t proceed against him on a large scale for
libel damages, the only possible inference is that neither
their their doings can bear public inspection.
A certain syndicate had an expert out in search
of any show good enough to float a co. on. Having come
across a good claim in the hands of five miners, he
arranged for the purchase of the mine for so many paid-
up shares only, in a 00. to be floated to work it. Flota-
tion was effected, and the directorate consisted of the
syndicate, who bought machinery and got the co. into
debt. The batik, which had granted an overdraft on the
personal guarantee of the directors, foreclosed—the move
being for one of the syndicate to buy the claim in privately
and get rid ol the paid-up shareholders, viz., the vendor*.
The vendors saw the move and carried on a long law-
suit, only to lost', as they had no money. However, while
they were fighting other troubles arose, and the claim
finally (jot out of both parties’ reach. The miners went
prospecting once more, and when asked their opinion of
Sto k Exchange gentlemen their language invariably
•tarts a bush-fire.

In the course of a few months something may
be heard of an amalgamation of the Londonderry with
adjoining blocks—to enlarge the area and make absolutely
certain of the underlie of the lodes to a much greater

Bayley’s Reward is rapidly running down-hill.
Last week’s output, “120 tons for 400 oz.” What price
Bayley’s shares six months hence? people are asking.
Already down to 12s.—a fall of 50 per cent, in three
months ! Yet- there is a lot of rich stone stacked below,
and when she has fallen to zero she may arise once more,
and knock on the jaw-point the people who are shorten-
ing the script.

Everything still is quiet as a graveyard about
the recent alleged find at Bayley’s No. 1 South, where
IOOOoz. were picked out in two hours. Some are in the
“know”—hence recent anxious inquiries for shares,
which have been increased three for one. Present price,
16s. Under these cheerful circumstances it is easy to pre-
dict the crushing will be a good one. But let not the
public accept that first crushing as typical.

The story goes that C. J. Buckland, who left
per Oceana for London, has in hand a marvellous Western
show, which has excited the whole-souled admiration ol
Professor Nicholas, and for which a working capital is to
be found in London. The show-, it is said, was found by
two of four mates on the first day of prospecting. Pro-
fessor Nicholas, The Bulletin hears, says that “ the reef
is 15ft. wide in some parts; that 500 feet will average 12ft.;
and 1000 feet will average Bft. thick. Moreover, it will
crush ounces, not weights."

At Cue, Murchison, there are several short
table-top hills. The quartz-reefs occur as horizontal
beds from a few inches to 3ft. thick, coursing through the
country in all directions, but with a slight incline to the
centre of the hills. The quartz is of milky whilenessand
carries, perhaps, 2oz. per ton, but as the quantity is
limited it is of no great value to any company.
On the edge of this belt there are a number of
small reefs running north and south, with smaller reefs
running at right angles to the main lodes. The molt
promising claims on this line are the Lady Mary,
Cue I, and the Rising Sun. These have been developed
to a depth of 200 ft., showing a fair but very erratic reef, as
the quartz is in and out every few feet and varies from
a small seam to 3ft. They mill from 2oz. to 3oz. per ton.
On the outer edge of the belt is the Lily line of
reef, the quartz of which is not so high grade. It is
being developed hy Streeter preparatory to floating in
London.
The next line of reef is the Leviathan, on which
are the Kangaroo Gem and other mines. The quartz is
an altered granite marked hy large blows on the surface
which form small reefs below from a few inches to 2ft’
wide. The quartz is frozen to the wall in places, and
divided into several small stringers mixed with the
country rock.
To the west of the Leviathan line are the reefs
of the Dead Finish district, of which there are a great
number. They might be described as specimen reefs, too
poor to mill in quantity.
South from Dead Finish and west of Cue are
the reefs of the Day Dawn district, of which the Day
Dawn is the most developed. The refcf outcrops from 6
to 18ft. wide, dipping on an incline of 65deg. west. It is
well-equipped with a 20-stamp mill and hoisting-gear.
One ore-shoot 160 ft. long has been opened up, and, so far
has milled an average of 15dwts. For some time the
tailings assayed Sdwts , but under Mr. Armstrong’s
management the mill is doing better work, leaving only
4dwts. in the tailings, and this amount, no doubt, will be
reduced shortly.
The Trenton is west of the Day Dawn about
half-a-mile, and owned by the Day Dawn Association. The
reef is short, showing a slight outcrop for a few hundred
feet, and the mines north and south have so far failed to
find it.
A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Unole Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peaoh and ivory may be had by anyone who make#
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

The high-kicking Girl of Yar-

London and rustic ancestral halls.
Some day he will be a bloated earth-
owner of 70,000 acres, yielding the
comfortable annual revenue of
<£oo,ooo. This small strip of land
is spread over Warwickshire, County
Down, and County Antrim, and
was mainly derived from the Con-
way family. Most of the Yarmouth
family wealth came from a bequest
by the last Duke of Queensberry

wife of the third marquess.
Two ladies and two children
were, on a recent day, waiting at a
South African railway-station, but
their train was not expected for some
hours. Cecil Rhodes, the local
Julius Caesar, came along, and a
“ special ” with two coal-trucks was
provided for his Masterfulness,
The ladies asked leave of the station-
master to travel per “special.” The
official referred them to Rhodes.
Said Csesar : “ AH' right; put ’em
in a coal-truck.” And then the
Dictator entered the only saloon
carriage. Which recalls that the
late Joshua Peter Bell, Acting-
Governor of Queensland, more than
once gave up his “special” carriage
to ladies who had invaded it before-
hand, and retired himself to a com-
mon second-class. It was a favorite
trick of women who knew Bell’s
courtesy to their gender.
Postmaster - General Duffy
(Vic.), when he applied to be admit-
ted as a solicitor, was met by the
same obstacle which confronted Ash,
M.P., of Adelaide. The rules pro-
vide that during the terms of his
articles the clerk must follow no t
business or occupation for profit,
and Duffy, as a paid M.L.A., was
objected to. The Vic. Supreme
Court, however, held that Duffy
didn’t follow politics for pay, but
through love of his bleeding country,
and he pulled through.

Straits Times distinguishes between the
attitude toward the public of Cecil Smith, the late

wear the high hat of European civilisation.”
The Age, last week, spoke of the Vic.
Chief-Justice as “Sir John M‘Madden.” This
was cruel to the man (successor to “George Higin-

Honorable Sir John Madden, Knight, LL.D.”
Mrs. Ivo Bligh, wife of the English
amateur cricketer, is on a visit to Melbourne. It
is ten years since the handsome B-echworth girl

the ordinary peeress, really meets the popular
idea of an aristocrat.
A most disgraceful scandal has just been
hushed up. It concerns an individual who, having
left Europe under unspeakable circumstances, was
endowed with an official position in Australia. He
has apparently been at his old game again, and a
warrant issued for his arrest by an independent
magistrate will probably not be allowed to take
effect.
It is not correct, as stated by Mayor Lees,
that George Thornton, still in the flesh, was the
first Mayor of Sydney. Mr. Thornton was Mayor
in 1857, and was the first after the city had
been administered by Commissioners ; but John
Hosking, merchant, of the old-time firm of
Hughes and Hosking, was first Mayor of Sydney
in 1842.
John Raven, who lately died at Hobart,
aged 72, was the son of an Anglican clergyman,
and was born in Tasmania, He had in turn been
sailor, constable, sergeant of detectives in N.S.W.,
miner, clerk, pressman ; and one of the acts of his
declining years was to send to a large London
publishing house a big box of MS. poems, essays,
tales, plays and operas, upon which many years
had been spent. The box was returned only a
few weeks ago after an absence of two years—
unopened. Then John Raven died.
Parkes’ boast at Mayor Lees’ banquet
that while Premier he never asked Mr. Black,
Mr. Brown, or Mr. Grey to vote for a Govern-
ment measure, recalls an ex - Judge Foster
story. Foster, then N.S.W. Attorney-General,
had been denied preferment to the Bench,
and in his wrath exclaimed, “And I supported
the measures you brought in!” “You did,”
replied Parkes. “ And this is my reward !” cried
the incensed Bench-hunter. “If you thought the
measures good, your reward lies in the conscious-
ness of your having supported them,” said Parkes,
“and if they were bad yon should have retired
from the Government rather than be a party to
their passing.” Then the political moralists
looked hard at each other and refused to shake
hands the next time they met.
Rev. John Turner died in Melb., the other
day. In 1850, Government gave him a valuable
allotment, corner of Lonsdale and Stephen streets.
He built there the Particular Baptist Church, not
much bigger than a large saloon railway-carriage.
It remains; and is said to contain all the saved of
Melbourne who are not already food for Particular
Baptist worms.
The National Scripture League (Melb.)
waited on R.C. Archbishop Carr, the other day,
to get a wrinkle about the management of religious
schools. Times are changed since ’4B, when
Father Geoghegan, the first Melb. priest, sent up
his card to Protestant Bishop Perry on the latter’s
arrival, and Dr. Perry refused to see the minister
of a “Satanic delusion.”
Of the late gilded Bobbie
Rand’s close-fistedness, this story is
told. A married manager on one of
bis stations had strict orders never
to buy potatoes whan they were over
Bs. a cwt. “Up to 85.,” said Bob-
bie; “if you pay more for them, I
won’t pay for <tliem, d’you under-
stand?” One day Bobbie called at
the station, and dined there, and
though potatoes were then dear,
some fine ones were placed on the
table. “ Those are good spuds,”
said Bobbie. “Yes, very fine,”
murmured the manager. “ But
they cost more than Bs, ?” “Oh,
yes; Bs. lOd.” “Then you can’t
book ’em to the station. I won’t
pay-, “ These aren’t station pota-
toes. My wife is very fond of pota-
toes, and I paid for these out of my
own pocket.” “ Oh, that’s all right,
so long as it’s understood that I
don’t pay for them.” . . . When
Bobbie was leaving ; “Oh, I say ;
you might put half-a-hundred of
those potatoes in my buggy for me.
I’ll take’em.” “ All right.” Mana-
ger shortly appears with “ half-a-
hundred ” tied up in a bag, an 1 two
fine potatoes visible in his hand.
Money counted out —4s. exactly.
Bobbie drives off. “ Coo-ee !’’
Stops. “Hold on a bit.” Mana-
ger walks leisurely to buggy, hold-
ing out the two fine potatoes afore-
said. “Thqse are fine potatoes,
Mr. Rand?” “ Yes, very fine ; is
that all you want to say?” “Oh,
no ” —putting the potatoes in his
pcoket—“ I noticed you enjoyed
’em yesterday at dinner, and I
thought you’d like to say good-
bye to them.” “You forget that
I have some in the bag he a’
“Oh, them! Them’s station j ota-
toes, and only cost 7s, 3d. a cwt.
Good day.” Bobbie pulled awry
face, cursed a bit, but drove off
with the spuds.
Bishop Green, of Grafton and Armidale,
N.S.W., the still raw victim of platitudinous con-
gratulations, discovers suddenly that one-half of
the fund which should support him has been
lost in unremunerative speculations. The Bishop
thought that those who appointed him to
the See preferred him to English candidates for
“ his pluck and ability,” but he is able to see now
that it was because he was “ green,”
Mrs. Ballance is going to erect a splendid
monument over the grave of her late husband,
and, by the irony of things, the dead statesman V
memorial-stone is being prepared in Hingland,
and is to be shipped out to Maoriland in a week
or two. Think of Ballance, the Protectionist,
whose whole policy was devoted to making Maori-
land self-supporting in every possible respect,
sleeping under an imported monolith from the
land of sweating and unlimited competition !
Truly no man knows what he or his bones may
not come to in the long run.
Mr. John Smith, M.L.O. (N.S.W.), who
died last week, aged 84, arrived from England in
1836, and became manager of a western station,
which he afterwards bought. As far back as 1842
he purchased the Gamboola run, Molong, and
steadily acquired station property until he became
one of the largest western land-owners. No pro-
perty was too small or too large for his purse—he
grabbed the quarter-acre township allotment as
readily as the country carrying three sheep to the
acre ; but he was a land-buyer only, and was
scarcely ever known to sell. He married, in 1841,
the eldest daughter of an old western identity,
“ Parson Torn,” of Guyong, whose name is joined
with that of Hargreaves in the first discovery of
gold at Ophir. A nong Mr. Smith’s children is
the popular wife of Mr. Justice Innes, of N.S.W.
Supreme Court.
G. A. Syme, elder brother of the late
E ienezer and present David, of the Age, is dead.
He began as a preacher, like the other Melbourne
veteran journalist, David Blair, and enjoyed con-
siderable popularity in England. He was thought
to have the best of it in discussions with Holyoake;
but seemed to get much loosened in his own mind,
and thought more freely the older he grew. Long
he dabbled over the T evder, but was never in
his element—a dreamy philosopher, a book in
breeches, rather than a journalist. One odd mis-
take of his, made as a new-ohum, is historical. At
St. Kilda police-station he fished out some deposi-
tions to a murder and published them at length.
They were six months old. Melb. Argus, by-the-
by, utterly ignored G. A. Syme’s death. The
Argus never heard of the Age in all its life.

In the absence of a satisfactory explana-
tion of the delay, it is discreditable that the
Frenchman, Grenon, under sentence of death at
Sydney for shooting a watchman at Rushcutters’
Bay, should be kept so long in doubt as to his
final fate.
It is down in the evidence taken before a
N.S.W. parliamentary committee that an ex-
amine “always understood,” at the time of last
general election, that, if Reid had to form a
Government, his Postmaster-General would be
George Black, M.P.
It is hard to say
yet how ad ult suffrage
will effect S.A. poli-
tic. d parties. Alto-
gether 73,000 women
voters are enfran-
chised, and a great
proportion of these
are In the metro-
politan area. So far
as the Assembly is
concerned the Labor-
party is much
strengthened, but the
property-qualification
increases the chances
of the Mule interest
in the Legislative
Council, and the
Defence League
already meditates the
appointment of a
woman canvasser.
The clause in the
original Bill prevent-
ing women from
sitting in the Legis-
lature having been
struck out, Premier
Kingston now lives in
terror of being con-
fronted by his aggres-
sive enemy, Mrs. Mary Lee, who heads the
B.A. Womans Suffrage League, and has long
been waving her gamp at him.
A perky politician of the Young Australia
school stood, the other day, with all his weight on
the heels of his boots, and, addressing ex-Premier
Parkes, said : “ The first President of federated
Australia must be an untitled native; if not, then
count me against Federation.”
ln Newfoundland, at latest advices, the
Government was reduced to such desperate straits
that it was paying the Civil Service with orders
on grocers and butchers. Think of the Australian
ireasury dude getting his salary in tickets entitl-
ing him to steak and potatoes ! Yet it may come
to that.
Solicitor-General Cuthbert, M.L.O. (Vic.),
had the task of moving the Land-tax Bill in
Council and blundered shamefully—mis-stating
the deficit by =8200,000. Premier Turner had to
sit speechless in the gallery while his junior made
a fool of the bill. The Minister in charge of a
bdl should introduce it into both houses.
“The late Chief Justice Higinbotham
would have been neither more nor less regarded by
his fellow-citizens if a title had been conferred
upon him,” says the Age. Higinbotham thought
differently, and preserved his good name. The
people would have refused to recognise the noble
George Higinbotham behind an Imperial alias.
Varney Parkes, M.P. (N.S.W.), intends
to reform the system on which estimates of costs
for public works are departmentally made. Some
day aiordly public officer will find his schedule
ot figures, representing the probable cost of,
say, the North Shore Bridge, forwarded by a
Minister to some private firm “for purposes of
verification and check.”
That the N.S. W. Civil Service Commission
will prove a rank and expensive delusion, is, to
anyone acquainted with the work to be done, per-
fectly certain. _ The idea of directing it to bring
u |> a report within three months is a very thin
disguise, as its secretary is appointed at an annual
salary of <£4oo. The work cannot possibly be
done efficiently within even a year.
A similarity has been found between
N.S.W. Premier Reid and Premier Rosebery.
Rosebery is pledged to Horne Rule, but delays it
and would rather go to the country with a cry for
a reconstruction of the House of Lords; Reid is
similarly pledged to Preetrade but delays it, and
is on the qui-vive for a pretext to go to the
country with a cry for the reconstruction of the
Leg. Council.
lie the disgust of Yic. Legislative Council
over Turner’s Taxation 8.11, thus the Argus :
The Council represents 170,090 ratepayers, and it is
absurd to suppose the ratepayers of Victoria have any
other desire than to advance the interests of Victoria.
Neatly put. The Assembly represents the man'
hood of the country, and it is absurd to suppose
that the manhood of Victoria has anv desire save to
advance the interests of the country. It is a poor
rule that will not work both ways.
Considering Belgium how she grows, the
Argus
Every adult male has one vote, and thus the one-man-
one-vote principle is recognised, but, on the other hand,
a double vote is given to married men of 35 years of age,
with a small property qualification, while three votes are
given to members of the learned professions.
“Thus the one-man-one-vote principle is recog-
nised !” So the principle of honesty is “recog-
nised ” by the man who steals his neighbour’s
fowls.
In dealing with the N.S.W. grain-duties,
Premier Reid consistently adhered to his one
seeming ideal of statesmanship—compromise. He
always “splits the difference.” Thus: Closing
one eye, and glassing the other—“ Ahem! duties
now on; my backers want ’em off in 6 months ;
others who may become my backers want ’em left
on for 12 ; halve the difference—leave ’em on till
Sept. 30th, or nine months. Amen. So be it.
(Signed) George Reid.”
Shiels, M.P., backing up a Woman’s
Rights deputation in Melbourne, the other day,
said of the female franchise :
They knew that one province already had this measure*
and he thought it only proper that the name colony of
the Queen, who was the greatest living example of’
woman’s capacity, should adopt it.
“Thegreatest living exampleof woman’s capacity.’
Was there ever a more eloquent argument in
opposition to female suffrage ?
Many of the “faked-up” petitions to Yic.
Legislative Council against the land-tax were
informal according to rule (being printed instead
of written), but were tabled nevertheless. There
were 41 petitions with a grand total of 2922 signa-
tures. Nineteen of them were copies of each other
and eight of these were printed, with blanks left
for the names of localities—obviously issued by the
Reform Club, the Ass, or some kindred body.
.Seven of the technically-correct documents were
from land-banks and mortgage co.’s. This is
Pat-man’s patent “ public opinion.”

A RATIONAL EXCUSE.
"Certificates of previous good character were
handed to the Judge, but he remarked that this
rather told against the prisoner than otherwise,”
&c.. &c.—DAILY PAPER.
THE JUDGE: “ Have you anything to say before
I pass sentence on you? ”
PRISONER: “ Nothing, your Honor—only that I
have borne a bad character all my life,
and I hope you will let me down lightly on
that account .”
The cable announcing Hume Black’s
return to Queensland mentions that he intends
to re-enter political life. No doubt, but Banana-
landers should have something to say on this
subject. Hume Black played all he was worth for
the Agent-Generalship; and when he couldn’t
get it, was proud and happy to become
a joint in MTlwraith’s tail with an Eng-
lish lectureship fee of .£lOOO a year—letting
Separation and bis constituents go hang.
His windy clamor about Queensland resources
was intended to hook immigrants on the one
side and inspire confidence among capitalistic rail-
way syndicators on the other. Nothing has
come of either spec., and as Garrick is gummed to
the Agent-Generalship for 12 months, and as long
after as he can secure, the itinerating Black will
re-enter political life if Queensland voters will let
him. That is, he hopes to go through Parliament
to the same old Agent-Generalship.

“the family” to appoint “one of the family’’ a

“ NOT IN HER LINE”
LADY (engaging servant at registry-office) : “Are you used to

Stephen ! This is attempted to be excused under
the plea that it is “ an act of grace to the dead ” !
Why not also ask “the family” to nominate
“one of the family” for the billet of Lieut. -
Governor, as “an act of grace to the dead”?
How much further does G. Houston Reid propose
to go in the way of setting up in N.S.W. a here-
ditary nobility ?
When the gilded Captain Pursey Chirn-
side (now suffering from a bad attack of colored
waistcoat) was standing for Grant at Vic. general
election, several electors asked him whether he was
in favor of One-man-one-vote. “Yes,” he re-
plied. “Why did you say that?” his com-
mittee asked him afterwards, “ You aren’t in
favor of it, you know.” “Oh !” said Pursey.
“ Why am I not ? Don’t you think every man
ought to have a vote?” And that was all the
deah boy knew about the subject.
Bendigo, Vic., Presbytery hopes and prays
that all Church properties not actually used for
religious purposes will be exempt from taxation
under the land-tax. Treasurer Turner replies that
the corner pub. and the pawnshop that pay rent
to the “Loord” will have to stump up, and the
Church is petitioning the Legislative Council to
“ make provision for the exemption of all Church
properties.” The Church is prepared to render
unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s. But it
claims the privilege of defining Caesar’s belongings.
The Roman Quintus Fabius Labeo, being
appointed arbiter to settle a boundary between
the peoples of Nola and Naples, counselled each
separately to do nothing covetously, and rather
to draw back than advance. Both taking this
advice, an unoccupied space was left between
them. He then adjudged to each people the
boundary to which it had confined itself, and all
that was in the middle to the people of Rome.
Here is a suggestion for the settlement of the
Victoria y. S. A. boundary dispute. Let Premier
Reid arbitrate.
The one parson in N.S.W. Assembly—
Rev. G. W. Smailes —has proved a hopeless
cypher in the House. Experience has shown the
parson in politics to be a blank and dismal failure.
The average minister may have some little in-
fluence at mothers’ meetings, and with milk-and-
water young women of both sexes ; but he cannot
rub shoulders with men. The parson is a success
only so long as he talks from the pulpit to an
audience muzzled by the Act of Parliament which
makes it an indictable offence to boo-hoo at or
contradict him.
“ Tom” Slattery, the bogey-man of N.S.W.
politics, who was credited by the daily press with
being at the bottom of every piece of smart
manoeuvring, has retired to look after his law-
business. Thomas was one of the “ properties ”
of the daily papers, and is now spoken of by them
with appropriate tenderness. Had the good-
natured and easy-going Mr. Slattery stuck
to his business as an attorney he could have
been a very rich man. Now, after al4 years’
feast of politics, he goes back to hard work.
Moral : Always do your work before dinner.
Likewise, lay to your book.
Anarchist Andrews has stated that his
defence when the seditious libel prosecution comes
on will* consist in an attempt to prove that he
wrote and spoke in substantially the same words
as N.S.W. Chief Justice Darley used while
sentencing certain fractious shearers. On 4th
Jan. the S.M. Herald in a leading article actually
anticipate* Andrews’ plea, and by emphasising
t'm Judge’s qualifications argues that the meaning
of the judicial utterance is perfectly clear. The
Herald may not have had Andrews in its mind
at the time, but all the same the article is in effect
a Crown Prosecutor’s address to the jury who
will try him. Undoubtedly Andrews will be
justified in challenging every juror who admits to
having read the Morning Herald of the date
mentioned.
At last Yic. general election the public
service vote was given to Labor and Liberalism.
r l he average man, when his pocket is attacked,
will for its defence ally himself, if need be, with
the Devil. This was the public servant’s view of
the situation when he voted for his erstwhile
bogey, the Trades Hall candidate. And now that
he has got back, largely through the aid of the
Labor members, the amounts which J. Beef
Patterson illegally deducted from his salary, and
the reign of terror in the service is over, the high-
collared one will probably abhor the Trades Hall
candidate as heretofore, and vote anew the genteel
Conservative ticket.
The cerements of
doomed Royalism are al-
ready prepared in pro-
fusion, and a rag can
occasionally be spared to
deck a political cadaver
like M‘lntyre. Let the
dead bury their dead.
Draper Sargood’s re-
tirement from Vic. War
office is a terrible blow
to the little jingo fac-
tion. Already a board is
looking for possible econ-
omies in the fuss-and-
feathers department, and
several agitated field-
marshals have been heard
to groan something about
the service going to the
devil. It is actually
suggested that the blood-
thirsty garter-merchant’s
old familar billet, which
remains empty for the
present, might as well be
permitted to lapse. All
the glory of Vic. army
seems to have departed
at one pop. The other
day Col. Templeton, a
prosaic accountant and
busted-bank undertaker,
discovered that every one
of his superior officers
had died or left the pro-
vince for a holiday, or in
some way made them-
selves scarce, and there-
upon Templeton walked
to headquarters armed
with an umbrella and
black bag, and assumed
supreme command of the
troops. Military swag-
ger can hardly survive
an incident like that.
When a liquidator soars
to the giddy height of
commander -in - chief it
must be time to wind the
army up, The Bulletin
imagines.
The £‘216,000 which N.S.W. Premier
Reid proposes to spend on roads and bridges in
1895 and to debit to the Dibbs budget of 1893,
will make another unnoticed addition to the public
debt of N.S.W. There is no such sum on hand ;
so the money, of course, comes out of loans. G. H.
Reid thus does a great part of the ordinary road
and bridge work of ’95 with borrowed money,
instead of providing for it out of current revenue,
and gets over the difficulty by calling it a deficit
left by his predecessor. According to law the
vote lapsed at the end of 1894, and so the money
can’t be legally spent this year, but it will be
spent illegally all the same.

In his spee'ch at Sydney Caledonian gather-
ing, Premier Reid, of the wondrous frock-coat,
spoke of his fellow-countrymen as “Scotchmen.”
This is most objectionable. There is a wide
difference between “Scot” and “Scotch.” The
Scotchman is the pious stage-fraud with hairy
legs and half-crown-sized freckles—the canting
church-elder who sands the sugar and “ jews”
feur-year-old lolly-buyers; but the Scotsman is
the open-handed, Macdonald-Oameron, sword-
dancing kind of warrior with the 50-inch chest,
and a retinue of six pipers, and a private dis-
tillery in his native glen. To be a Scotsman is
a noble thing, but anyone convicted of being
“Scotch ” deserves seven years. Georgey-Porgey
Reid should paste this in his hat.

Gov. Duff has made his peace with Sydney
Highland Society, and cemented the bond with
Reid treacle. The vice-president, who last year
suggested that the absent impotentate’s health
should be “drunk in silence,” was prevented from
being a skeleton at this year’s feast by an oppor-
tune journey down the coast, where he stayed
“ weather-bound ” till the danger was all over.

The claimant of the estate of old “ Bobby ”
Rand, who died intestate, leaving £250,000 behind
him, seems to have come to grief at a very early
stage of his career. His claim, according to the
daily-paper rep irts, is based on tire assertion that
Rand was married before be left England, that
he had a son, and that the man who wants the
money is that son. The case on the other side
is that Rand left England at the age of 12 and
never revisited it, and on the strength of this fact
his legal.representatives desire to put it on record
as their fixed opinion that he must have married
very young. At present the case stands there.

Gov. Kintore was not too popular in
Adelaide Anglican circles, because he rarely wor-
shipped at the cathedral, but preferred a little
suburban church where an English friend was
curate. Previous Governors especially W.
Robinson— made it fashionable to visit the cathe-
dral and ostentatiously plant a half-sov. in the bag,
and Gov. K., by abolishing this custom, deprived
St. Peter’s Cathedral of hundreds of pounds per
annum.

Some Sydney suburban tram-guards pray
daily for the soul of the tin-pot legislator who
continually parades his trumpery importance at
their expense. Verbatim example. “ Ticket,
please!” “D’you mean to say you don’t know
me?” “No, sir!” Furiously—“ Send the other
guard here ! ” Quietly—” It’s my duty to take
your ticket, sir!” “There, then” fiercely
thrusting out gold “pass”—“and remember, my
man, I’ve taken your number ! ”
Gov. Glasgow, of
Maoriland, when in
Rarotonga the other
day, was inundated
with presents of raw
coffee-beans. He bas
since written to the

Asylum : “As I have

I know what to do
with, I am willing to

Dear Bulletin,—
When a bibber commits
a crime, he is accused
of committing it as a
remit of drink-worship.
When a cold - water
saint perpetrates a vil-
lainy, .he does it “in

worse ? Alas, why not
give an extra crown to

never commits a crime worth special mention !

“What has Mr. MTubyre done that he
hould be singled out from his fellow-citizens as a
proper subject for distinction by the. Crown?”
asks Melb. Age. Well, he headed a great Sand-
hurst grovel when the Duke of Edinburgh visited
the town. Moreover, the Argus certifies that
MTutyre has done “yeoman service for the con-
stitutional cause in company with Mr. Downes
Carter and others.” Certainly, it is a long time
since Mao. slavered the Duke and assisted the
g'Jted Carter to hold up the Constitution, but the
Crown has a long memory for services of that sort.
And wasn’t he VillageSettlementer in the glorious
Patterson Ministry, which invited the Yorks to
come out and make the country cheerful? The
Bulletin is not surprised at MTntyre’s knight-
hood. The odd thing is that Carter didn’t also
get a “distinction” on account of his late
lamented Budget. What has Carter done that he
should be allowed to remain an ordinary wine-
merchant?

An Anglican parson, a sincere and able
man, with a wife and eight children, in the diocese
of Ballarat, was engaged at a £250-a-year stipend
which has now tapered down to £l3O paid
grudgingly and at erratic periods. His parish,
200 miles from the seaboard, is, perhaps, the
hottest, dreariest and dearest hole in the province,
and from motives of economy he decided to send
his family to live in Melbourne. This, however,
was angrily vetoed by the congregation, who
objected to their “ thrippences ” going to enrich
the traders of the metropolis. Gloomy fact!

A sign of the times. The chief Church of

It is said that several of the reputed
aborigines in La Perouse camp, near Sydney, are
ex-newspaper editors from the country press. The
story seems feasible, for a N.S.W. £3-a-week
country editorship, advertised the other day,
elicited over 200 applications, including many
from really good men. So much for journalism as
a profession.

It is suggested in a Sydney paper that
sermons should be abolished. The point is at
least arguable. Washington Irving said that a
man could earn a reputation for wisdom in either
of two ways—by talking a great deal and thinking
very little, or by shutting his mouth and not
thinking at all. Perhaps it’s just about time for
our spiritual advisers to try the latter alternative.

Apropos a lurid current scandal, it need
only be observed that you can’t expect professional
soldiers to be very moral. They never are. For one
lobster-coated Puritan you can find ten-thousand
rakes. Given well-paid, more or less, idle men
who gain their positions by means in which brain-
power is the least and social influence' the greatest
factor—given, in addition, a set of idle women
who adore brass buttons and Guvmentouse and
glory in general, and what can you expect? No
wonder the padded man usually gets into trouble
in the long run.

Unlicensed distillers in and around Sydney
often get no more than 2s. or 2s. Gd. per gallon
for their whisky ; and the charges in the way of
bribing watchers, and taking bogus trips here and
there to throw excise men off the set nt, and
carrying on at a loss some bogus industry as a
blind, are so heavy that the principals, after all,
sometimes make less than a pound a week. The
publican who can absorb the stuff is the money-

A b.-each-of-promise case, Love v. Kiss, was lately tried
at Perth (W.A.)—
Many things may happen when gentlemen
leave the grocery-trade to enter upon newspaper-
management and preside over the revision of
“ society ” articles. Thus does the charming
lady-writer of Sydney Sunday Times expatiate
upon “Beds”: —
Bpdtnaking is an art which concerns everyone, and
widoli I am convinced very few women have ever taken
the trouble to acquire. Men have told me that they
would rather sit up all night than enter the beds at s ane
hotels and hoarding-houses, for apart from what Mrs.
Carlyle’s famous servant used to call “ bogues,” the
alleged places of rest are as uncomfortable as the back of
a dromedary. Many women just leave their beds as a
hare does its form, without ever turning back the bed-
clothes, or allowing the close air that has arisen from the
sleeping body to escape; or it often happens that lazy,
dirty creatures turn back the bedclothes all in a mass,
unseparated, and then, to save themselves trouble, draw
them back over the bed in the same condition. What
is the result? The bed retains an unclean and horribly
unwholesome smell, and the room is as musty as a
morgue. It will be still worse, if you persist, as I know
many of you do, in wearing in bed the woollen under-
clothes that you have had on all day, and winch
may be reeking with the effluvia of perspira-
tion. Horrible ! No, you should separate every-
thing, shake the blankets and the sheets, and
hang them in the open air, or on chairs in a good
draught, for at least half-an-hour. That precaution,
which will give a healthy tone to your room, is surely
simple. See that there are no hillocks on the bed, and do
your best with the materials at hand to make the ensemble
artistic and attractive.

The new tenants were accomplished artists,
and took the trouble to decorate their hired resi-
dence with yellow-astered dadoes and pretty wall-
pictures. They also “whacked in” some stun-
ning panels on the doors, and, proud of their
handicraft, they showed the landlord all the
beautifications. His full approval of the gratuitous
decoration of his premises was expressed by—
clapping on five shillings to the weekly rent. _ It
was those artists’ very first convincing political
lesson.

On 3rd Dec., 1854, took place the storm-

the anniversary last month. Peter Lalor s grave

now note this and act differently next 3rd Dec.

was that he had

she wasn’t quite 16
years old. When
she was approach-
ing 17 he married
her, and when she
was somewhere
about 18 he sooled
the dogs on her and
chased her into the

then retired to ask
itself the old, old

The Argus, describing recent troubles at

A Melbourne clemi-mondaine recently
found a new way of liquidating a large and hope-
less-looking hotel bill. She beguiled a fatuous
old gentleman of good repute, and he took her to
her own hotel, where he registered as “ Mr. and
Mrs. Jones.” Next day he asked for his bill,
and found that it was .£24. “ Wha-a-at’s this?”
he asked, feebly. “We only stayed here since
yesterday.” “Yes, sir,’’ said the landlord, fixing
him with his glassy eye ; “but your wife has been
here two months. She said you would pay up
when you came.” And he paid up. It was much
cheaper than explaining.
An Auckland (M.L.) fish-dealer who lately

Hesuggested that his poem should be published,
and the proceeds arising from the sale be given to
the fund, and it was necessary to drive him out
before business could be proceeded with. And yet

Kiss courted Love in the moonlight pale,
And under the golden sun :
The man told ever his old, old tale
Till the fluttering heart was won.
On ripe, sweet lips he feasted high ;
Then, sated with easy bliss,
He turned away with a weary sigh
From the Love that craved a Kiss..
Love courted Kiss with a suit for “breach,”
In the humorous Hinglish style,
And the learned Judge he gazed at each
With a sorrowful, learned smile,
Whilst an angel moaned, on the roof above—
“’Twere a wonderful jury, this,
Could it reckon the damages due to Love
From that fickle deceiver, Kiss.”
But a day shall come—not yet, not yet—
In a time which counts no years,
When the Kiss of passion must pay its debt
To the Love that it left in tears.
True Love will plead for the rascal base,
And the debtor may win release
By offering then to her smiling face
The Kiss of eternal peace.

In Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, the other
evening, two men assaulted and robbed a harm-
loss passer-by, and then, with great presence of
mind, they called a policeman and gave him in
custody for _ being drunk and incapable. The
ordinary policeman generally sets down every-
body who is excited, or angry, or apoplectic, or
who has been stunned with a club, as drunk, so-
he seized the victim and cheerfully hauled him
along, despite his frantic explanations. It was
onlywhen they had gone about half-a-mile, and
the defendant had told his story for the tenth
time, that the stolid “ cop ” began to awake to a
dim perception of things and went back to look
vainly for the two strangers. They were gone,
however, and haven’t been seen since.

English Christmas literature lays such
stress on kissing under the mistletoe, that one
might be justified in imagining the mistletoe a
necessary adjunct to the osculatory rite. Yet we
in this country who have no mistletoe to kiss

quite comfortably under a Moreton Bay fig, or
an iron bark, or a tram-shed. Yes, as long as we
have a tram-shed, blow your mistletoe!

struck a suspicious case, he sent instructions to the

As in other N.S VV. State departments,
promotion in the public schools service is almost
wholly governed by seniority. Merit is, however,
recognised in the form of passing pupils through
University examinations; a success which may be
obtained in a few of the very largest schools by
assiduous coaching during routine hours. But the
great majority of teachers must gain distinction
by working the hours of thesweater. One Sydney
teacher spends two or three hours nightly all the
year round, at his private residence, in cramming
his older pupils for coveted University passes.

“ Men who strive for money, as a means

The most violent and aggressive claimants
on the Wairarapa Relief Fund, so far, have not
been poor steerage passengers and sailors, who
lost their little all and came ashore practically
naked to start the world afresh, but the large, fat,
well-to-do saloon passenger, who demands pay-
ment out of the public subscriptions for his lost
dress-suit and his bell topper. Some individuals
of this description have made the life of the relief-
committee a burden, and even threaten legal pro-
ceedings if the dress-suit and the bell-topper
aren’t replaced. The saloon passengers got all the
advt. there was in the wreck; they button-holed
all the reporters and told fairy-tales of their own
valour ; and if they could get all the relief-fund
as well they would probably be satisfied.

Sydney Worker publishes extracts from a

member of the New Australia Settlement’’—the
letter is said to be dated “Las Ovejas, Sept. 2 ”
speaking cheerily, cracking ironical jokes at the
alleged “starving” condition of the children, and
pitying by contrast the condition of those left be-
hind in Australia. It really seems unnecessary
secrecy to keep dark that writer’s name. To
whose interest among those having special favors
of audience with the Sydney Worker is it that
roseate views of New Australia should be dis-
seminated abroad ?

SLEWED!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was threat ning to rain as the red sun sank
down,
And the races were over in Bidgeebel town :
“ A long ride out home is too much of a lark,
’Tis likely to rain, and the night will be dark ;
Will you start out to-night, Pat! what do you say ?
In town till the morning I'll certainly stay,”
But snake-headed Paddy must needs mount his
horse—
In a hurry to get to the station, of course.
Much whisky he’d swallowed that day, had my
mate,
And his “ bump of locality ” never was great.
He rode out in the darkness, gave “ Cookie ” his
head —
And “Cock-Robin” steered for the racecourse
instead
Of the road to the station; whilst Paddy, half
“screwed,”
Ne’er dreamt for an instant how much he was
slewed.
The bay horse “Cock Robin” ain’t slow—for a
hack,
And once had been trained on that Bidgeebel
track.
And all through that night he paced on, and ne’er
showed
Inclination to shift from “ the track ” to the road.
Around ! and around ! ’twas an unending ride—
But Cookie ” ne’er faltered, nor wavered, nor
shied,
He stuck to that track, and—though Pat’s a big
Weight-
Seemed to freshen each time that he “ entered the
straight,”
Lark and chill was the night, in the sky not a
star—
Though they went a long journey they didn’t get
Till at length when the dawn-light appeared in
the East,
And the rider was sobered and tiring his beast,
Pat gazed at the grand-stand: “Oh, what can
this be?
Are these station-buildings, begorrah !” said he
Then he suddenly “dropped;” so came back—
and got tight,
And (foolishly) told how he’d put in the night.
To bushmen who liquor, the lines of this lay
(If they happen to read em !) a moral convey :
“ If in town they get tight
They should camp there that night ;
Or, 1 don’t say they will , but they possibly may
Like Paddy, my mate, in the dark get astray.

THE BREAKER.
An Australian Scientist.
lo many an old miner “The Etheridge ” will
recall tramps under a North Queensland sun,
watches kept against wild myalls, and fossicking
over the quartz reefs; but few know that the gold-
field was named after a Sydney resident, tint
gentleman who was 1 ist week gazetted as Curator
ot the Australian Museum. Robert Etheridge
jnr was born in the purple of science, hii
father being a well - known savant attached
to the British Museum and Geological Survey,
xoung Etheridge was one of the brilliant group
who officered the first geological survey of Vic-
toria and who were widely scattered on its break-
up. Selwyn, its head, removed to Canada, where
he gained added fame as director of the Canadian
Geological Survey. Wilkinson returned toN.S.W.
and rose to be Government Geologist. Dain-
tree migrated to Queensland, where as author,
artist, and explorer he surveyed and des-
cribed the mineral wealth of the Ear North.
Before he left Australia to represent Queens-
land as Agent - General, he named a new
goldfield, “The Etheridge,” after his old Vic-
torian colleague. On losing his appointment,
Mr. Etheridge returned to Europe and obtained
employment on the geological survey of Scot-
land. Across the seas, Australia still fas-
cinated him, and his studies were frequently
directed to the solution of Australian geological
problems. In 1878 he produced “ A Catalogue of
Australian Fossils,” which still, though out of
print, is the standard work on the subject. Wider
opportunities for research were gained by his
removal to London, consequent on receiving an
appointment in the British Museum. His interest,
in Australia was kept alive by the collections:
transmitted and discoveries reported by Mr. R. L..
Jack, his Edinburgh friend and fellow-worker,,
who, by this time, had commenced his Queens-
land career. In 1887 Mr. Etheridge returned
to Australia, undertaking the joint duties of
palaeontologist to the Australian Museum and
to the geological survey of New South Wales-
which he held till the end of last year,,
when he succeeded Dr. Ramsay as curator of the
Australian Museum. At their next meeting the
Royal Society of N.S.W. will present the Clarke
medal to Messrs. Etheridge and Jack for their
investigations into Australian geology, to our
knowledge of which none have made larger con-
tributions. Besides half a dozen bulky volumes
Mr, Etheridge has published a hundred and
fifty papers on scientific topics. Most of these
deal with fossils of which few men, certainly none
south of the equator, possess so profound a know-
ledge. The ethnology of the Australian blacks is
another subject on which Mr. Etheridge ranks
as a high authority. In his new office, his
science will have full scope.
It is related that a certain Customs officer,
whilst delivering a sugar ship, looked at the sun
so often that he only chalked his weights on the
vessel’s side, and did not enter them in his book. In
the morning be discovered this, and went down tn
rectify it, but found the vessel had gone miles:
away. He followed her and found his marks in-
tact! He was previously bald, but got such a.
shock that his hair sprouted.
The fulsome eulogy of John Walter, in
the Times, is a challenge. The greatest Walter
was the second, the next the first, while the third!
was “ not in it ” with them. In fact, his bungles
reduced the status of the paper, so that it has to
share the lead of the world with half-a-dozen-
even if it be now in the fint flight. Walter did
not understand that the conduct of a great paper
requires a strong man’s whole energies. He was
a fourth-class M.P.— in itself an injury to the
limes. ihe affair of the city editor, Sampson,
was a fearful blow. Nor was the next city editor
a success. Then came the Parnell facer. Delane
was badly treated. Chenery was a thorough fish
out of water. Buckle has been ill.

If so, safe remedies are within your reach at a
nominal cost. CLEMENTS TONIC and FLET-
CHER’S PILLS have never yet failed to cure the
worst cases. General debility, nervousness, weak-

medies. They are prepared by scientific processes,
and are not merely mechanical”mixtures made only
to “gull the public.” The renown CLEMENTS
TONIC and FLETCHER’S PILLS have won in
Australasia is proof of the fact that they stand
preeminent for their special classes of diseases.
No remedies oversold gave such entire satisfaction
to their patrons, and evidence is forthcoming from
every city, town and village to prove their virtues.
No doubt can now exist as to their value, but
purchasers must be careful to get the genuine
articles, as many unscrupulous traders will attempt
to palm off a substitute, if possible, for the sake of
extra profit.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.

MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Princess's Theatre “Beauty and the Beast.”

Bijou “The Judge."
At time of going to press, the Sydney
shows remained the same as last week. The four
big theatres are all open, and as the natural
result of so much theatre the cold blast of adver-
sity is beginning to blow with noiseless feet upon
one or two establishments and wither up the
takings at the front door. G. Rignold’s panto-
mime at Her Majesty’s, “The House that Jack
Built,” has caught on, however, in a fashion which
almost recalls the palmy days of old, when a soul-
less minion of the law had to be beseeched not
to fine the management for over-crowding. The
fire - act, where the ghouls and witches
dance amid a huge bonfire and come out young
again, is partly responsible for this popu-
larity ; and it is partly owing to the pretty
scene where a hundred or two of baby builders
rush up the house which Jack didn’t build after
all, and leave it completed at sunrise. There is a
ballet also which establishes a record for frank and
candid undress, and a gallery of politicians, where-
in G. Republican Dibbs appears as a thing which
is partly Hebrew old-clo’ man and partly Old
Father Time with his scalp-lock badly disarranged.
If G. Republican Dibbs wants to fully realise the
vastness of his fall he need only go and consider
this horrid presentment of himself, and realise
what the public thinks he looks like since he got
his title.

“Cinderella,” at Sydney Lyceum, con-
tinues to look a good deal brighter than it did on
the opening night, and somebody’s friend Macin-
tyre keeps breaking out in new and unexpected
spots. The two men in women’s clothes, and the
lamented death of Cock Robin are still to the front,
and Miss Ray Jones has got over her preliminary
nervousness—or, at least, over a good deal of it —
and tackles her part in a more effective fashion
than she did at first. And everyone you meet in
the street is humming the tuneful tenor’s “Sweet
Marie.”

“Hans the Boatman,” with the old
favorite, Charles Arnold, as the poetic owner of
the big dog, will be staged at Sydney Criterion on
Saturday. “Hans ”is for six nights only, and, so

arrangements.

Bland Holt is doing well with the “ Span
of Life” at Sydney Royal, and a change of pro-
gramme is still afar off. The camels, the realistic
steamboat which takes a bee-line for destruction
on a dark night, the lighthouse, the Arabs, and
the other glories of the show are all in good health
and doing well. The “Span of Life ” lays over
all the other melodramas which The Bulletin
can remember just now in the matter of realism,
and next time Bland Holt is faced with the eternal
necessity for going one better he will have a par-
ticularly hard row to hoe,

R. S. Smythe writes that our correspon-
dent “G.,” in last issue, is right in stating that
Mrs. Annie Besant gave her share of the profits of
her Australian tour to the Theosophical Institute
in London, but in putting her share of the Sydney
lectures at £79, “ G.” is very unjust to the people
of Sydney, who patronised Mrs. Besant’s 10 lec-
tures so liberally that her share averaged .£3O per
night. “ G.’s” £79 odd was what she got for her
four extra lectures, when the gilt was off the
gingerbread. So long as the Theosophical Insti-
tute has a member who can earn money for them
at this rate, it would surely be madness for W,
Q. Judge, or any other correspondent of the
Mahatmas, to think of expelling her.
** * *
Bulletin readers, and the theatrical
public generally, will be shocked to hear that
Miss Myra Kemble’s illness appears to be much
more serious than at first anticipated. She is
pronounced to be suffering from internal cancer,
and her relatives have no hope of an ultimate
recovery. The loss of this bright and clever
actress to the Australian stage would be greatly
felt, and The Bulletin sincerely hopes that the
worst fears are unfounded.

no reduction in Daddy has been accomplished.
Daddy’s popularity is really based on baggy
trousers and bladders concealed about his person,
although his bony legs also find great favor when
he appears in undress, with a rug strapped
round his middle. He changes his clothes and toils
unceasingly. In the opinion of all who can laugh
at this industrious comedian, and have not heard
his songs, or other versions of them, sung by Will
Whitburn in days of yore, “Beauty and the
Beast ” is a successful pantomime. Even those
who don’t find Saker a great source of merriment
may at least feel grateful for the timely suppres-
sion of two other imported funny men. The couple
in question maddened their first night audience
by talking, for ten solid minutes, about a family
that died in bed, and a mother-in-law who suffered
from large feet, after which they defied the masses
with a melancholy duet. They are now reduced
to the ranks, so to speak, and the fact that they
came from a distant country to do something is
quite lost sight of. Six characters in this enter-
tainment follow Daddy around in single file, like
the tail of a comet. Miss Polly Emery, sad to
say, is a portion of the tail aforesaid. The clever
little woman is naturally funnier than ten panto-
mimes put together, yet she is doomed to hide her
true character in the background.

Miss Marie Luella’s legs are a pair of
heavenly twins, also her voice is mellow, and all
that she does is done handsomely, but one must
admit that the dear “ boy ” might do a little more
without wearing herself out. Miss Alice Saker,
as Beauty, is a fairly bright music-hall inrjinue,
who expresses artless simplicity with a ta-ra-ra
smile; whilst the dancing of her young friends,
the village children, is the prettiest incident in
the show. The Ballet of Nations goes very well,
and the living pictures, which at first were
“skied ” in the transformation-scene, so that only
their calves caught the eye, have been re-arranged
by artist Gordon and the hanging-committee.

“ Aladdin,” at the Royal, has three strong
points in its favor It is the best of all pantomime
subjects for incidental display; the deep stage
gives the spectacles plenty of elbow-room, and the
audiences are immense. A crowded house is a
stimulant to a show of the purely Xmas kind.
The company throw off their feeblest topical allu-
sions with easy confidence, and a roar of applause
encourages them to deeds which they wouldn’t
dare to commit in cold blood. Consequently,
“ Aladdin ” becomes more lively every night. It
is the right thing in the right place, with the right
Maggie Moore at the head of affairs, ready to
meet any emergency. There can be no stagna-
tion where Maggie Moore is concerned, and the
value of her festive personality on occasions like
this is just as great as ever it was.

George Darrell’s season at the Opera House
didn’t stretch further than Saturday night. “ The
Nightmare,” which probably came from America,
is a wildly elaborated nigger farce, with the burnt
cork rubbed off its surface. Throughout three
short acts the members of George’s company were
either chasing him in the hope of getting married
(he being a matrimonial agent), or lodging com-
plaints against a gouty person, who exploded an
infernal machine in their midst. George himself
had a romantic side to his character, as shown in
his habit of writing verses on sheeps’“ jimmies.”
Another tender soul was the bald-headed waiter,
who wanted no dowry with his bride, but ex-
pected her to come provided with a change of
“unders.” Had “The Nightmare” been a
reasonable comedy, it was quite naughty enough
to run for three months.

“ The Judge,” at Melb. Bijou, holds out
much better than The Bulletin expected, and
the wail of the wax baby in the next room is heard
every evening until further notice. Situated be-
tween the two pantomimes “The Judge”seems to
fill a want. Moreover, the Bijou prices are
“ popular,” and the aroma of past successes clings
to William Elton’s name. For that reason,
perhaps, Elton is gradually breaking down
the barrier between one of .Her Majesty’s
Judges, and Lurcher, the Dorothian bailiff. Any-
way, Sir John Pye, flattering a policeman’s
mother in “ The Judge,” might as well be Lurcher
paying his addresses to Mrs. Privett. The
policeman’s ma happens to be Mrs. Bryer, and
that lady assists in bringing “Dorothy ” back to
one’s mind. Miss Clara Thompson, who invades
the Judge’s lodgings after midnight and compels
him to nurse her infant, errs a good deal
on the side of extravagance, but even she is
a mild offender compared with Elton. For
the rest, Wilfrid Shine, as the baby’s male parent,
is not very happily placed, but the Judge’s
daughters—Miss Harrie Ireland and Miss
Katherine Hardy—are deliciously sweet and
natural. Also, their innocence is such that when
their supposed step-mother produces the baby as
evidence that she married their papa a fortnight
ago, the artless young creatures merely clap their
hands and cry “ How nice!”

The question with the lady patrons of “ The Judge,”

Dear Bulletin,— No wonder “ The Firm” occasionally
imports some mediocre foreign talent, for the locally-
grown article has a rough road to travel. For instance—
I wrote a song, which was sung for two weeks with great
success at a Sydney house. Everyone who has heard it
has a good word for it. Despite this, the manager would
not print the name of the composer in the programme,
and not a paper—weekly or daily—gave even the name of
the song. The second week found it going so well that
it was kept on, but only one weekly paper gave the title
of the local song, while all the British productions were
named in full. If my song had been a failure 1 should
have been pleased with this conspiracy of silence, but as
it is successful beyond the average “colonial” production
I think they might have printed its name, especially as I
sent copies for review. lam not trying for a cheap ad.

the fact. —P.A. Melb., Dec. 28, ’94.

Saker, the new Princess’s pantomimist, is, to a con-
siderable extent, a tailor-made comedian. It probably
takes nine tailors to make this humorist. He wears a
fresh suit every time he comes on, and each suit is more
preposterous than the other, one of his •• finest effects ”
being produced by wearing blown bladders in the bosom
of his pants. Saker must have a very modest dresser, or
the latter would insist upon stepping out and acknow-
ledging some of the applause.

Those “negro minstrel” shows in England and America
which have adhered to the original style of male per-

class of entertainment seems to have set in with the intro-

George Edwardes, manager of London Gaiety and
Empire theatres, strongly objects to the representation
of nude figures in Living Pictures. He thinks that their
only attraction for “ those who care to see them ” depends
upon the idea of indecency. Moral George Edwardes !
The most important branch of the business of his theatri-
cal life has been the procuring of shapely chorus-girls
how many of them kept “ straight ” ?—for the purpose of
displaying them in burlesque costumes that suggest
nudity to anyone who seeks suggestiveness. A motion-
less figure of a girl posed to represent an artistic study
from the nude is quite as wholesome a spectacle as a
young lady dancing and glancing in a costume which
barely fills a glove-box.

An erstwhile well-known “ romantic ” actress, lately
entered a Case lor legal separation against her husband,
writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent, but the
case has been withdrawn. The hubby is a rich Man-
chester man, who, to afford his wife an opportunity of
distinguishing herself, built a theatre in London, and
presented it to her, but she could not make a hit. She
produced a ghastly bad play, which was hissed off
the stage. On that occasion she came forward, and with
tears in her eyes, and in her best tragedy manner, asked
the audience if they wished her to continue or not. The
reply was emphatic, though no bricks were thrown.

The worst point about that astounding
return of deadheads on the N.S.W. railways is
the unabashed manner in which alleged democrats
have taken advantage of their Parliamentary
position to bleed the taxpayer on behalf of their
female relations. From the Barbours and Melvilles
and Willises one expects nothing better; but the
Cottons and Raes and Traills, without mentioning
the Blacks, Cooks and Bavisters, or the Scheys,
Eddens and Fergusons, should be the first to dis-
courage a system which has no shadow of justifica-
tion, and lends itself so easily to flagrant abuse.
For how can aM.P., whose wife or daughter travels

Have Miss Danahey’s unpaid journeys any better

variety of taxpayer and his wife and the
hard-up seamstress or governess, dump their

SPOUTING NOTIONS.
An impartial outsider wou'd say that the result
of the two test matches goes to show the Australians have
not got the Englishmen’s stamina. They are not so
reliable, so consistent, as their cold-climate cousins.
More brilliant in patches, their brilli nicy can never lie
depended on at a crisis ; their “form ” is,here to-day and
gone to-morrow, while the Englishmen rarely fail to piny
up to concert Ditch. “It’s dogged as does it.’’ Then
some of the Australians play to the pavilion, the bar-
raokers, and the reporters ; the Englishmen invariably
play to win, and sink individual success in the success of
the team. And they are not handicapped by having three
bosses in three provinces, with three sets of prejudices
and preferences. This by way of explanation, not of
excuse.
• • • »
The fiction that English “test” teams would
always prefer to meet the Australians on a sodden
wicket was invented by a patriotic press to suit the open-
ing of the Melbourne match. It is an undeniable fact
that the British “cracks,” from Grace downwards, are
fair-weather batsmen, and that the Australians, com-
pelled to learn, on hard ground, to howl with their heads,
are superior to the more mechanical pros, who are in-
dulged with so many bowlers’ wickets in their own damp
country. The Australians in England have never abso-
lutely won a test-match on a batsmen’s wicket, but they
have twice triumphed in the mud.

Another Byron Moore is wanted to take the
Melh. Cricket Club ground in hand and make a pretty
show-place of it. The shilling part is a badly-asphalted
slope, furnished with an absurdly small amount of dirty
seating accommodation, and on the other side of this
semi-circle hill there Is nothing but squalid chaos. The
scoring-board and box, and adjoining circumstances, are
not a hit like what they might he if the M.O.C. “author-
ities" had less gas and more go.
• * • *
The failure of a S.A. batsman against the
Englishmen was prophesied by intimates who heard him
talk. In his last innings against Stoddart’s men he
got double figures, and said, “I’m in good form;”
whereas, in one innings against Grace and Co., he hit up
149, and afterwards exclaimed, “Some day I’ll, make
1000; I'm as full of runs as a dog is of fleas.” With the
loss of the art of run-making, he has also lost the gift of
eloquence. He should take a spell.
* * * •
S.A. Cricketing Association was asked by
Melh. Cricket Club and Sydney Ground Trustees to join
in the risk accompanying Stoddart’s team, but the
S.A.C.A. d dined. The receipts up to and including the
Melh. test match have, however, paid all expenses of the
tour, and the two bodies expect to divide over £7OOO
profits next April. This news will be very pleasing to
the Adelaide body.

Let us look facts calmly in, the face. The
Englishmen have won the first two test matches. In the
first match the Australians had the rosiest of rosy
chances —and did not win ; the English had the barest of
bare chances and did win—although their howlers, it is
true, were given their opportunity on a sticky wicket.
In the second test-match the Australians were set 428 to
win in their second innings ; the English had scored 475
in their second. The Australians, on a run-getting wicket,
failed ; with 3 for 206, a rot set in, relieved only by the
game batting of Iredale, who scored 68, and when Iredale
was at length bowled by Peel the innings closed 94 behind
the English score. Giffen admitted that the better team
had won ; it would indeed he hard for him to admit any-
thing else with the grandly consistent hatting of the
English staring him in the face ; for Richardson, who
made 11, was their lowest scorer. If the English retain
their present form, it seems any odds that they will come
out of the test matches with the supremacy. .Meanwhile,
the Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide cricket associations
had better fly an advt. from the flag-staffs of their respec-
tive pavilions: “Wanted, a phenomenal. Australian
bowler.”

Lockwood was brought to book by the crowd
during the Australians’ Melh. second innings. After
delivering the ball he would, apparently without neces-
sity, run up the pitch, which, already worn after four
days’ play, was not improved by this conduct. That this
was a fact was proved by nine of the Australians being
dismissed from that end.
♦ ♦ ♦
On the penultimate day of the second test-
match the climax of woe tor Australia was reached
when Trumble got run out. Trumble had played a palter-
ing game all along, hut at the ignoini nous end, to an un-
pleasant innings the hearts of the hqrrackers stopped
with a sickening thud. Wicket after Wicket had fallen,
but not till this awful moment did despair take full
possession. A sporting Englishman offered 10 to Ito a
jockey standing near him. “ Bah !’’ said the jockey,
“it’s hell to 1.” . . E’en the ranks of Tuscany fore-
bore to cheer—the Britishers, present in sufficient num-
bers, looked on joyfully, hut their joy was chastened with
pity. Australia seemed to have defeat and disgrace
assured—and then Iredale and Turner rose with healing
on their wings and staved off the disgrace.
* * » •
It has been reserved for the M.C.C. to put up a
record for cricket trickery. The M.C.C. is an alleged
gentlemen’s club—purse-proud and arrogant. In its
match against the East Melh. C.C. it was afraid to
play the game on its merits —it preferred tactics. Fri-
day’s heavy rains made the wickets sticky and almost un-
playable—M.C.C. won the toss and sent in E.M.C.C. to but.
So far, so good. E.M.C.C. were put out for 91—and
M.C.C. went in to bat. When 5 wickets were down for
61, and the wicket terrible, M.C.C. closed its innings and
thus forced E.M.C.C. in again to play in a bad light on a
wicket the M.C.C. shirked. The object all sublime of
M.C.C. was, if possible, to force its opponents to play two
innings on a bowler’s wicket, its own crowd being con-
tent with half an innings on a bad wicket and the big
chance of a good wicket on the next Saturday. By a
wrench of rules M.C.C. thus obtained for itself a second
option after winning the toss. In the second innings 5
of the best E.M.C.C. batsmen have been got out by the
ruse, but it is to be seriously hoped that the remainder
will score heavily enough to defeat the most miserable
and unmanly cricket subterfuge ever attempted in Aus-
tralia.
• * * *
Nobody begrudged Brockwell a bowling success
in the Melbourne match. His comparative failure as a
batsman on Australian wickets had begun to dispirit the
Surrey crack, and the pleasure of finding himself a heavy
scorer with the ball was extra sweet. In his little
luncheon speech, Brockwell modestly referred to himself
as an emergency bowler, but the last Australian Eleven
in England saw cause to think highly of his attack.
* * ♦ »
What are the odds about all the Englishmen
getting double-figures in their next innings against Aus-
tralia? Pretty considerable. Nevertheless, they are
clearly a pluckier team when put to it than the overrated
Sheffield Eleven of three years ago, and Sloddart is a
cleverer tactician, on and off the field, than W. G. Grace
proved himself. '

“What have you done with Humphreys?”
yelled the shilling wags, when Trott and Bruce were

regard his absence as a mean British trick.

row a match for £2OO a side on the Thames, or two
matches for £2OO each on Thames and Tyne. It is hard
to know what be means by resigning, unless it be that
should he be beaten by the “ bantam ” he could still pose
as an ex-champion. Harding’s friends think it a cer-
tainty that he can lick the long ’un. To-day it is also
announced that Harding will row Bubear for the

The old yacht Australian, better known to old-
time Sydney boating-men as the “Beaky," has been
broken up. The Australian was built upwards of 40 years
ago by Dan Shea, and when Walter Reeks, the English
naval architect, first came to Sidney and saw her model,
he said that the Austialian was the boat the Britishers
had been aiming at for a lifetime. The old Beaky was a
freak, and to the day of her smashing up nothing local or

Dear Bulletin, —In a recent big consultation a
man and his two mates drew a horse owned by a Central
Q. owner, to whom they wired, offering him “ £lOOO to
nothing first.” Owner wired back in reply: “Am not
satisfied—can do better here. Want £l5OO first, £5OO
second, £3OO third. Reply through ” the sweep.
prom iter). They were hard-up, and so laid him what
he asked. Now, that wire of his laid before the stewards
of the club would surely have called forth the pertinent
query: “How was he going to do better?” Would it
not? Pleasant thing for the sweep-subscribers, this black-
mail by owners of horses. And isn’t it likely to harm the
sweep-promoter in the future? Plenty of people, the
writer included, would have replied to the owner: “Do
better and be !”— Subscriber.
The Bulletin understands that the owner of
one horse, which was a very hot favorite for Melb. Cup,
demanded a clear half of any first, second, or third prize-
money that might be won by the drawers of his horse in
the two biggest Tattersnll gambles. The penalty for non-
compliance with this request was, it is said, to be the
scratching of the “ moral.”
“Subscriber, ” it will be noted, does not say that
the sweep-promoter gave any information whatever as to
who held the ticket, but the incident is another clear
proof, were proof needed, that whenever drawers’ names
and addresses are disclosed to horseowners the door to
intimidation and blackmail is opened. In a word, dis-
closure reduces the value of 20s. worth of big chance in a
sweep to 10s., less 10 per cent. If the sweep-promoter
stipulated in his circular for a half-share of the place
prizes, his rapacity would seem shameful. Yet it is all the
same to the ticket-purchasers, taking them as a specula-
tive body, whether the sweep-boss or the owner levies this
tax. In a 100,000 sweep, Jones or Brown takes odds of
99,999 to 1 against winning either of the three stated
sums, with mmor contingencies in his favor, and if those
sums are to be sweated as aforesaid, the value of his
investment is reduced accordingly.
Owing to the policy of ticket-drawers in throw-
ing offers at owners’ heads by way of inducing them to
start their horses, some owners almost persuade them-
selves that they have an honest claim upon sweep moneys
—as though the lucky ticket-holders were outside backers
who had stepped in and spoilt the betting-market for
i hem. In the latter case, an owner has some sort of
e i lev ance against the man who stands to win a fortune
upon his horse—in a sweep case he has none whatsoever.
-Sweeps tend to feed themnarket instead of starving it, by
giving the lucky ones a chance to lay-off a hit” to the
books at a liberal price. A horse-owner should properly
have no more to do with a sweep-ticket-holder than
w ith the man in the moon.
In sweeps, we, the public, are gambling among
ourseWes. We agree to pay the swer p-promoter two
shillings in the & as commission, and draw lots for shares
in the remaining’ 90 per cent, of our pool. Horses are not
necessary to the gamble. We could run our spec, if we
hked on German-lottery lines, and considering that the
iuif, take it altogether, is a sinful matter, the public
ought not to let their lotteries encourage the breeding of
dead-birds. ■ A lottery which yields a subsidy to horse-
racing is twice as unwholesome as it need be.

Dick Burge has been taught by bitter experi-
ence that it is not wise to give too much weight aw'ay,
especially when opposed to a man like Ted Pritchard, who
simply knocked him out in . ight minutes. Pritchard
fought savagely, audit looked as if there was some bad
blood between the men. There was a long delay wrangling
about a referee, and this did Burge no good, as he was a
bit on the light side and looked very pale. Eventually
Joe Steers, the quasi-amateur boxer, was chosen by con-
sent of both men, but all he had to do was to count
Burge out. A lame and impotent conclusion. It is
singular, remarks The Bulletin’s London correspondent,

Dear Bulletin, — He Beckwith’s over-arm swim-
ming “ The mode of swimming among the Mandans, as
well as among most of the other tribes, is quite different
from that practised in those parts of the civilised woild
which I have had the pleasure yet to visit. The Indian,
instead of parting his hands simultaneously under the
chin and making the stroke outwardly in a horizontal
direction, causing thereby a serious strain upon the chest,
throws his body alternately upon the left and the right
side, raising one arm entirely above the water and reach-
ing as far forward as he can to dip it, whilst his whole
weight and force are spent upon the one that is passing
under him and like a paddle propelling him along. Whilst
this arm is making a half-circle and is being raised out of
the water behind him, the opposite arm is describing a
similar arch in the air over his head, to be dipped in the
water as far as he can reach before him, with the hand
turned under, forming a sort of bucket, to act most effec-
tively as it passes in its turn underneath him. By this
bold and powerful mode of swimming, which may want
the grace that many would wish to see, I am quite sure
from the experience I have had, that much of the fatigue
and strain upon the breast and spine are avoided, and that
a man will preserve his strength and his breath much
longer in (his alternate and rolling motion than he can in
the usual mode of swimming in the polished world.”—

J. G. Kennedy, the retired champion amateur
sculler of N.S.W., is one of the few men w’ho loved train-
ing and whom training loved. Out of condition he scaled
41b. less than when in the pink of form ; with him to
train down was to train up. He could set any man at
rest who doubts the encouragf raent given to Sydney
scullers. He won the amateur championship four times
in succession, viz., from ’B7 to ’9O inclusive, and as win-
ning this event three times in succession meant securing
permanently the Sydney Mail Gup, Kennedy claimed it
from the Rowing Association. They, or “someone,” had
however, lost it; but they promised Kennedy a 25-guinea
trophy in lieu of it. They also promised him a medal for
beating six other competitors in the amateur champion-
ship sculls of ’BB. These promises have not been re-
deemed. Now that there is a (baby) Kennedy, jun. the
association might get ready in time to bequeath’ the
trophy to the retired champion’s heir-at-law.

Gov. Gormanston (Tas.) tells this story: “I
was down in Bally (something or other), a small country
town in Ireland, to see a race-meeting, and everything
passed off very satisfactorily until, close to the finish of
the principal event, the jockey on the leading horse, see-
ing No. 2 coming up rapidly behind him, deliberately
crossed, bringing the rear man almost to a standstill and
then galloped in first. To my amazement, up his name
went as winner. I sought the judge, whom I knew very
well, for an explanation. ‘ Well,’ said he, ‘lt was a cross
ahure enough, but, ye see, it’s this way—the man who did
it comes down here every year and gives us a hundred
whoile the other feller’s niver been here before.’ ‘ And 5
added His Ex., ‘I was so damned disgusted that I’ve never

Sydney Truth’s new missing-word competition

known of form or condition ? And even if you do <r e t one
leg in you never hear about it. The gambler who responds
under such circumstances to the cheerful invitation, “ Be

Thousands of people will be glad to hear that
the straight and manly “Billy” Guesdon, erstwhile of
Warwick Farm Racing Club, Sydney, has lately had a
substantial piece of financial good fortune. It is related
of the gentle William that long ago he and a friend of his
were made J.’sP. and went to court to get their hands in
Judicially. Almost the first case called concerned cruelty to
a horse. William’s sporting blood was aroused at once, and
his friend was a sportsman, too. “ Look here, prisoner,”
said W. Guesdon, J.P., “you are a hopeless ruffian. If
you had half-killed a man as big as yourself in a fair row j
—well, the court might have had some sympathy, but to
thus treat a helpless horse is unpardonable. It is a case
Of ten pounds or three months. Next time it will be a

proceeded to lunch. Prisoner, in default of pay-
ment, had been removed to gaol, and his disconsolate
family now came round to beg the beaks for mercy.
The end of the matter is, of course, obvious to anybody'
acquainted with W. Guesdon, J.P. He and his friend i

Writes “Victor”: — Blarneystone stands out
prominently as the most successful holiday race-per-
former. This full brother to Marvel has improved latterly
out of recollection, and his wins in the two Cups place
him amongst the best handicap horses in Australia. Like
old Highborn he has blossomed late in life, and, to carry
the simile farther, he will, if not weight-crushed, emulate
that grand old black’s performances by accounting for
some of the more classic of Australian races. J. Tierney
deserves praise for the masterly way in which he rode
Blarneystone in all his races. There is no “flashness”
about his riding, and, as he uses his head well, there
should be a bright prospect before him.
Tridentate’s running in both Cups was to me in-
explicable. With that able hors°man, James Gough, in
the saddle, he never once showed prominently in Tatt.’s
Cup, though he went out a strong second favorite. How-
ex er, I don’t yet mean to absolutely sponge him out.
Donation, after running last for part of the
journey, finished up fourth in Tatt.’s Cup, and as he is
now getting into rare fettle he may shortly be returned a
winner.
Ruenalf wants a spell. ’Twas deplorable to see
this really grand horse finish absolutely' last in the two-
mile race. Owners should remember that horses are not
machines.
That grand mare, Florrie, ran very consistently
in both Cups, and no one would have begrudged Walter
Hall a win with her in either of them. At the gale of
y earlings at Wellington Park, near Auckland (M.L.), a
full brother to her—a chestnut colt by Tasman —Rubina—
was sold for 45g5.!
Pharamond is getting into form : he ran well in
both Carrington Stakes and New Year’s Gift.
Havilah White’s successes with Georgio, Ti-
woona, and Form were well received and, moreover, well
deserved.
Vanitas and Blarneystone were two nasty
knocks for the ring, but otherwise the fielders had, as per
usual, much the best of the game.

But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-
eminence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston,
a resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Mel-
bourne. His name has become almost literally a house-
hold word ; almost every other man you meet has a
wonderful story to relate of some almost miraculous cure
he has performed in an acute or chronic case of long
standing, where other physicians have failed. He ad-
dresses himself in particular to cases that have baffled the
skill and science of other doctors. His name is a suffi-
cient guarantee of a perfect cure of every case he under-
takes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to
your life.
YOUNG MEN.
You will find this distinguished doctor your best
friend and benefactor. If you are troubled with weaken-
ing dreams, unrefreshing sleep, a tired gloomy feeling, and
loss of energy, ambition and self-confidence, which im-
pair both your body and brain, and absolutely unfit you
for study, business, or the proper enjoyment of married or
single life ; if you are suffering from those or similar symp-
toms you know the cause. Do not allow false pride and
sham modesty to deter you in seeking relief. Before it is
everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat
it with unfailing success.
MIDDLE AGED MEN.
There are many of you afflicted with weak, aching
back and kidneys, loss of mental and physical power and
vigour, wasting weakness, and not unfrequently accom-
panied by an impairment of the general health. In justice
to this celebrated specialist it can be truthfully stated that
in all such cases of middle aged men, as well as of young
men, his success has been almost invariable.

Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy' action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.

liver, promoting the secretions c f Bile, and chrrecting it
when deranged, ai d restores healthy' evacuations in cases

D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB—I find thrse Bitters a

When Miss Adelaide Blank recently
married a S.A. newspaper canvasser, “I wasn
sure,” sighed the bridegroom to a congratulatory
friend, “that I had got my ad. till the contract
was signed.”
J. A. Andrews, the anarchist, charged at
Sydney with seditious libel, is in his thirtieth
year, and claims to be of English, French, Ger-
man, Scandinavian, Spanish, Arabian, African
and Hebrew extraction. All these nationalities
fused themselves into a grandfather who was a
baronet and a father who was chief clerk in an
important Australian public department.
Melb. Argus demands a further lavish
outlay on “our defences,” on the ground that, if
some foreign enemy successfully raided Victoria,
“we should lose our good name and our self-
respect. We should feel that we were not worthy
members of the valiant British race.” Apparently
the only good name is the name of someone who
has successfully mashed a foreign enemy, and the
advantage of having a good name is that it makes
us feel we are members of the British race. The
idea of having a good name and being members of
the Australian race isn’t even mentioned.
There seems at last to be a fair prospect
of the Field of Mars (Sydney) tramway scheme
being carried out. To a recent deputation Min-
ister Young made a distinct promise that, if the
work could be done for less than ,£20,000, it would
be carried out, whereat the far-sighted speculators
and syndicates who purchased the land are
jubilant. It appears that some eight years ago,
when the land was sold, the auctioneers made a
kind of promise that the Govt, would build a
tramway to connect with the metropolis, either
via the G.N, railway or the Parramatta River.
As a consequence the land was bought at a good
price, not by genuine settlers, who might use the
tram, but by speculators in unearned increment.
For some reason or other the tram was not built,
and a Field of Mars tramway deputation has
howled on the Ministerial door-mat ever since. If
the line is built it will never pay, as the district
is too far removed from the metropolis for suburban
population and is already sufficiently catered for
by the G.N. railway. This is one of the many
cases where a Betterment Act would come in
with advantage.
Justice is muzzled revenge.
A Northern Moses has got badly taken
down by-a varnish-manufacturer, who hypothe-
cated a large quantity of his output. When the
crash came, Moses found himself left with a lot
of varnish that had been specially manufactured
for hypothecation. Now, if asked to give evidence
before the Tariff Commission on the varnish
industry, his remarks become unfit for publication.
They are again clamouring for the New
Guinea variety of nigger-slave up North. The
dear old kanaka kind has taken to firing on re-
cruiting-boats, by way of showing how he loves to
come and be kicked in the neck by planters’ over-
seers ; and there has arisen a warm desire to
clothe, and Christianise, and civilise the savage
New Guinea brother, and teach him “how to
cultivate the cane which will some day be the
staple industry of his island.” But Administrator
Macgregor rather sniffs at the charity which
begins so far away, from home, and the scheme
languishes.

STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, THOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 547 George-street, Sydney, in the Colony of
New South Wales, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows :
Whereas I suffered severely from a very troub'esome affection of the Nerves, which
affected me so much that I was quite unable to ai tend to my business. I tried several’doctors
and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr
Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal “Alfalinf
Vitality Pills,” which I hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare COMPLETELY CURED Me with-
in a few weeks, and although this is over five
years ago I have remained well ever since.
The Alkaline Pills also cured my wife, and
I make this solemn declaration conscientiously
believing the same to be true.

Sydney Wool Sales.
M'Burmsv, Wallis & Co. report.—On Thursday, 3rd
i'isr.., we oil red a catalogue of small lots only, at.d found
competition very brisk, with prices equal to rates lately
ruling. The advantage of making a sale of small lots
only is that owners may rely upon their wool having full
attention of buyers who cannot be otherwise attracted by
the presence of large lots. We almost cleared our cata-
logue, thus proving our sale to be a marked success. On
Thursday, 10th inst., we will offer an attractive catalogue
of about 2000 bales, consisting of clips from New England,
Mudgee, Yass, Monaro, Goulburn, Young, and other dis-
tricts from which wool is now arriving in Sydney. Syd-

A BIG BIZ!
Our Trade is Big! Our Store is Big I
Our Ideas are Bigl
We get bigger every day; on Saturday night
we are bigger than on the previous Monday,
and on the Wednesday following we are bigger
still. We can’t help growing. We have all the
elements of growth. The soil we are planted in
is good, the climate propitious, the people kind.
We are continually watered by the lifegiving
showers of a nation’s approval. Can anyone
wonder that we grow ?
Our growth is a wonderful thing. _ People
describe it as magical. There is no magic in it.
Anyone, or any set of people, can do the same if
they do as we have done. But they don’t; they
can’t find the way, charge too much for the privi-
lege of doing business with them, and generally
and deplorably make a mess of the whole affair.
That’s the mischief.
Most People Like Us! All Believe in Us!
Not a Few Swear by Us!
It’s cupboard love. We suit them, make their
money go a long way, and generally render the
path of life an easy one. There’s no sentiment
about it. It’s real biz, and no mistake. In that
way we are beloved throughout Australia, the
measure of affection each one bestows upon us
being gauged by the amount of benefit received.
The more you buy at our store the greater your
liking for us will become, because the more you
invest with us the better dividends you receive.

J. H. YOUNG.
The Sydney unemployed agitators have
decided on a new (Coxey-like) plan of campaign.
They propose to concentrate all their numbers in
Sydney, so as to “compel the Government to find
work for thein.”
The Bulletin is glad to note that at the
recent Sydney University examinations a son of
the poet Kendall got through his second year.
Young Kendall promises to become a good
Grecian—an aspiration strongly felt by his father,
who, however, lacked the opportunity and tena-
city of purpose to become a classical scholar.
Apropos of free passes, The Bulletin
would like to be informed of the circumstances
under which a certain writer was granted a first-
class free pass over all N.S.W. lines for 12 months
by the Colonial Secretary’s Department after it
had been refused him by the Railway Commis-
sioners.
Archbishop Dunn (Q.) has raised the sec-
tarian education cry. Boodlewraith is re-
joicing thereat, foreseeing a loss to the Demo-
crats, who cannot possibly compromise on the
Education question, while the gang in office will
promise anything and give—nothing !
Cabled that Harcourt has resigned the
leadership of the House of Commons, and his
place in the Government; also, that a dissolution
may be expected shortly. If this report is true,
the disagreement between Rosebery and his
colleagues must have reached a critical point.
Apparently the wound which Harcourt suffered
when Rosebery was preferred to him for the
leadership of the Liberal party has rankled instead
of healing. D spite press support, Rosebery has
not been a success as Premier; a big section of
his supporters are dissatisfied with him ; and Con-
servative prospects are steadily brightening.
Many people who read this par. must need
a galvanised tinned-iron bucket, which is a utensil
calculated to bring true joy into every home, being
useful and ornamental, and handy to put the baby
in. Those people are invited to buy that bucket
from J. Partridge, who manufactures such articles
by the million at 261 Harris-street, Pyrmont,
Sydney. Mr. Partridge also creates innumerable
galvanised tinned-iron tubs ; galvanised iron ridge-
capping, guttering, and down-pipes; colonial
ovens, and all kinds of tinware. As he has special
machinery for turning out these things promptly
and cheaply, people who deal with him will be
well served, and will have the satisfaction of
patronising a native industry and keeping their
money in the country.
The demand for Frossard’s Cavour Cigars
has lately increased so much that the capacity of
the Swiss factory has been taxed beyond its limits;
and for a short time, at least, the market supply
cannot cope with the demand. Active steps are
being taken to make the output equal to the heavy
orders from all parts of the world. The mildness
and refreshing aroma of Oavours renders them
quickly popular, and the medical profession is
recommending them in cases where the nerves or
the heart are affected by a stronger smoke. Their
low price is also in favor of Cavour cigars. This
is a result of the cheap shape adopted, which
•■nables the manufacturers to put all the value into
t le leaf employed, instead of presenting to the
p iblio a cigar with a gracefully finished point
vhieh takes a lot of time to make, and is obtained
it the expense of the quality of the leaf.

THE FISHERMAIDEN.
(From the German.)
Thou bonnie fishermaiden,
Now row thy boat to land j
Then come and sit beside me—
We’ll talk thus, hand in hand.
Lay on my breast thy little head
And do not fearful be ;
Dost thou not daily trust thyself
To this tempestuous sea ?
My heart is just like this wild sea,
Hath storm and ebb and flow;
And in its deep full many a pearl
Of love lies far below.
Q.
P. LUMA.
Dear Bulletin, — Apropos of the eternal
strife between Woman and Religion, and the
latter’s insistence that the former should wear
more clothes, did you ever come across Reclus’
description, in “ Primitive Races,” of the manner
in which India learnt decorum at the point of the
British bayonet? He says :
The ladies of Calcutta were shocked. They represented
that Her Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria could not tole-
rate some of her subjects wearing nothing but a bead
waistband, plus a leafy bough before and behind. ...
Christianity and civilisation suppressed the innocent
nudity of the Orissa jungles. . . . In 1871, a company
of soldiers marched into a village, assembled the in-
habitants, and 19 women filed before the captain, and fell
on their knees. Two sergeants and four corporals pro-
ceeded-still in the name of Her Chaste Majesty—to per-
form the toilet of the fair sex. The first put a red mark
on the brow of the kneeling woman, to teach her the first
lesson of modesty. She rose and stepped forward to
where stripes No. 2 waited to put a hand on her shoulder,
and tear away the foliage in front—let us bow before the
virmous sovereign who presides at the drawing-rooms of
Uucki ighara Palace 1 Tommy Atkins No. 3 relieved the
savage of the foliage behind, and all the greenery was
thrown into a fire lighted for the purpose. The 4th
soldier put a petticoat on the poor woman, the sth
strapped it round her waist, and the 6th saw her out of
the door. A child of nature she went in, a civilised
woman she went out, having laid aside savagery, and
being clothed in Manchester cotton.

Dear Bulletin,— The 21-mile plain
stretches between the Bokhara and the Bulga, and
all the way there is not a splinter of wood big
enough to make a toothpick. Years ago, when
the'telegraph line was first erected, the wires were
supported on wooden poles, but owing to a habit
the teamsters and “swaggies ” developed of chip-
ping off enough timber to boil the billy, the wires
were always coming down, so iron posts had to be
substituted. One day, when the temperature was
about a billion in the shade, two raw newchums
were making across the 21-mile, and in their
simplicity, neglected to provide themselves with
fuel. When the billy question arose, big Ned
(who weighed about 16 stone) suggested that they
should set fire to the grass and long Patsy (the
sinewy man from Clare) should hold the billy over
the burning grass and follow it along, while he
(Ned) held the tea in readiness. There was a
nice little breeze blowing in the wrong direction
and when the grass was fired it started back at a
good brisk pace. But Patsy could run like a deer,
and he bolted after it, keeping the billy over the
burning edge, Ned bringing up the rear with a fistful
of tea. When Pat had cantered back about six miles,
the water began to boil and he looked around
anxiously for Ned, but the pace had been too
violent, and all that was visible of him was a little
cloud of dust against the sky. So Pat sat down
in the midst of that baked plain and cursed Ned
till he arrived with the tea, by which time the
water was too cool for making tea, but not cool
enough to drink. Then Ned cursed Pat for going
so fast and for not keeping the water boiling, and
then Pat cursed Ned again, and there they sat, puf-
ing and blowing and gasping with thirst, their red
eyeballs glowering at each other, and cursing
whenever they could get sufficient breath. At
last, when they had cooled down a bit, they
decided to drink the water as it was and return to
their swags. Unluckily, there are no landmarks
on the plain, and it took them the greater part of
next day to find their belongings. When at last
they succeeded, they discovered that the dingoes
had been there before them and had eaten their
provisions and destroyed things generally. Then
they cursed each other at large, after which they
refilled their billy at the clay-pan and marched on
m sorrowful and hungry silence.—Yours, G.

SOMETHING ABOUT TWO BOYS.
“The most pathetic incident of my childhood is
this : My mother had been very ill for several
weeks, and the doctor solemnly announced that
she could not live more than two or three days
longer at most. That night my father roused me
from sleep and took me out of my little bed to bid
her a last good-bye. I shall never forget the
scene, which was new and awful to me. People
were weeping all round the room, the air of which
was heavy with the odour of candles and lamps,
and reeking with the fumes of drugs. My mother
knew and kissed me, and then they took me back
to my bed. But ere I was led away some one
opened the window a few inches from the top, and
I noticed the grey dawn resting on the glass, and
heard the ‘cheCjc, cheep,’ of a newly-awakened
bird. Since then I have associated that hour and
sound with that unhappy episode.
“ But (and to say what now follows I have
written the foregoing paragraph) we were all
rasped and tortured for nothing. My mother
to get well hand-over-hand, and died
quietly thirty years afterwards. She survived
every person who stood at her bedside that night,
:except me.”
Speaking of the illness of her son, a boy of
nine, a lady says : “We bad to sit with him
night and day, giving him brandy, wine, beef-
tea, &0., to keep him alive, and expected every
■day would be his last. The physician plainly told
us that nothing more could be done to save him.”
Yet, in spite of the disease, and—we almost
said—in spite of the doctors, the lad is well to-day.
And this is how it all came about. There is a
moral in it, too, but suppose we serve that up at
the end of the story,. All right, you say. Very
well, then.
It seems that this boy, George Westmoreland,
had previously been a strong, healthy little chap,
as all boys ought to be. But about the middle of
last November—lB9l, that is—he was taken
down. Tiie family couldn’t make out what ailed
him. He complained of a bad pam in the stomach,
and vomited a quantity of yellowish-green stuff.
Presently the pain was so sharp he couldn’t lie in
bed, and they had, so his mother says, to apply
fresh hot poultices one after another. The whites
of his eyes turned yellow, and. his skin, too. He was
hot, and feverish, and had |o fight for his breath.
Of course his mother sent for a doctor, and the
doctor said his young patient was suffering from
inflammation of the; bowels. He gave medicines
which, however, did;no good. so far as the boy’s
friends could see. On the contrary, he grew
worse, and a second doctor was fetched. This
medical gentleman differed from his predecessor,
and gave out that George had an attack of rheu-
matic fever—in other words, acute rheumatism
a disease which no boy has any business with
whatever.
The treatment on this theory availed nothing ;
George was worse. He now had a hacking cough,
and his expectoration was so offensive that the
people had to use disinfectants. He broke out
into sweats, so heavy as to saturate the pillows.
He could take no nourishment save a little milk
and lime water. He wore away to a skeleton, did
the poor boy. He was nothing but skin and bone,
and they had to lift him in and out of bed. Then
he fell so ill he would not notice anyone in the
room, and lay for hours never opening his eyes.
Then came the time when a third doctor said he
couldn’t possibly live.
What happened after that the boy’s mother
tells. We give you her exact words: “In
February last,” she says, “ my husband, as a last
resource, determined to try Mother Seigel’s Cura-
tive Syrup. After a few doses the boy’s breathing
was easier and he took food. In three days he
was able to sit up, and in a week’s time he was up
and dressed. He gained flesh and strength every
day, and is now able to go about. Sometimes I
look at him and can hardly believe he is the same
boy who was so recently at death’s door. Seigel’s
Syrup saved his life. Yours truly, (signed) Mrs.
Mary Westmoreland, 5, High Street, Piumstead,
London, April 27, 1892.”
Now, half a dozen words. Little George had
no bowel inflammation, nor a single touch of rheu-
matism. That was the doctors’ professional guess-
work. He had a sharp attack of bilibusness and
indigestion, of which Mother Seigel would have
cured him long before had her medicine been
appealed to. Here is the moral to conclude with :
Learn what the true remedy for illness is, and use
it first instead of last.

Victoria has got news of her warship
Nelson, whereof the last previous word was that
she was hanging on to the shore by her telephone-
line. Now, however, the Defence Department
proposes to repair her if she will hold any more
nails. Against this the Customs Department
urges that, though her hull is rusty, if scraped she
would spring a leak. The reason for this rotten-
ness is that several times the caretaker went
round town and left the ship out in the rain. It
is now proposed to stop the city gutters and allow
Port Philip Bay to evaporate. The Nelson would
then rest on dry ground, and they could build a
shed over her. This would enable the crew to
sleep on board when the weather was fine, and
sometimes even when it was rather windy.
Dr. A. Mueller, of Yackandandah (Vic.),
whose strychnine treatment for snakebite is now
widely accepted as specific by a large and intel-
ligent section of the Australian medical profession,
writes as follows :
D„-ar Bulletin,—Some people are born great, others
have greatness thrust upon them. It became painfully
apparent to me that I must belong to the latter class when
I saw my old face figuring among the celebrities in your
columns. For the surreptuiouiuess with which you ob-
tained-my portrait, I can forgive you, but we shall,
serioudy quarrel if you allow Mr. “ Steele Grey,” with his
bits of Ditiu and his bits Of ill-digested knowledge, picked
up prdmis Jlously, to writs'any more nonsense in your
columns re snake-poison, strychnine and chloride of lime.
He is evidently in disguise, but through the lion’s
skin of pretended knowledge in which he envelopes
himself, I plainly see the long ears protruding!
Who ever heard of snake-poison, when injected
into the blood-stream, causing blood-clots to form,
that ft 1 up the chambers of the heart of the poison
killing in one way when thus injected and in quite another
way when injected beneath the skin ? Who does not
know by this time, if even but superficially informed, that
it is no blood poison at all, and that all presumed antidotes,
supposed to act on it chemically, after it has entered the
bloo Istream, or supposed co counteract its imaginary
blood-destruction, are simply bunkum, chloride of lime
not excepted! Mix the latter with snake-poison, or,
what means the same thing, inject it immediately
after the snake has bitten you, and in all probability
you are right ; but trust to it after the poison has
been absorbed into the system, which is effected in a
very short time, and you are sold; for snake-poison
is a proteid that differs but slightly from other
perfectly harmless proteids in the system, and the sub-
stance has yet to he found that will select the poisonous
proteids from the harmless ones with which it is mixed in
the blood. This chloride-of-lime cry was got up by a few
gentlemen who felt jealous of the success of the
strychnine treatment and would fain put it down if they
could. Finding they cannot, and, at the same time,
somewhat distrustful of their new antidote, they now
propose to divide honors by recommending both to be
used together. “Steele Grey" appears to be one of
these, or, if not, has probably rubbed his back
against their learned sides. This supposition is
coafirmjd by the concluding part of the effusion that
accompanies my portrait, and smells strongly of Alma
Mater. This “post hoe ergo propter hoe” argument has
ere this been advanced against my treatment inhalliof
science and in lecture-rooms. It unfortunately applies to
half the cures we doctors effect, but to the strychnine
treatment it does not apply—for this treatment is based
on a thoroughly scientific and well-proven theory of the
action of snake-poison, which theory led me to look upon
strychnine as the antidote to s.iake-poison, long before I
ever injected it into man or beast.—Yours truly, A.
Mueller, M.D., Yackandandah, Victoria, Deo. ’94.

Some time since, Robert Qanthony, the entertainef
(brother to Nellie of that ilk, who will soon be seen in
Australia), wrote a farcical comedy, which he gave to
Weedon Grossmith to read. Qrossmith lost the manu-
script, and was put to his wits’ end to find excuses for
not having reported on the merits of the piece. One day
he would tell Ganthony that he had not had time to read
through it, next he would praise the first act, which
was all he had so far read ; then he would affect to find
fault with the second act, and so on. At last he con-
sulted his brother George, who advised him to call at
Scotland Yard, in case the lost document might have
found its way there. When he explained his business at

Oh yes, sir, the manuscript of a play has been found,
and as it bore the address of Mr. Ganthony, Richmond,

went away into a retired place to throw things at himself.

disappointing, hut that is the author’s fault as much ai
his own. John Le Hay, however, is an enormous success
and helps the piece along marvellously.

A Talk with Peel .
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Whbn in ’B2 Peel made his as an All-
EngJand representative against the Australian
Eleven at Manchester, he bowled down six
wickets for the small total of 41 runs. That
success was full of promise, and in the 12 years
that have since elapsed, Peel has proved himself
the most consistent bowler against whom Aus-
tralian batsmen have had to contend.
The famous Lohmann could do more on certain
wickets ; but on all wickets, good or bad, Peel has
ever been the same consistent Peel. Lohmann,
too, has, on a nine years’ average, beaten him for
the English bowling championship, but only by
an insignificant fraction.
Peel stands alone as the English bowler who in
county matches for the last 12 seasons has sent
over 1000 batsmen back to the pavilion. It is
Peel who has done sensational bowling in Aus-
tralia, bagging, in ’B4, 353 wickets for 5 - 75 runs a
wicket. At Moss Vale he got 18 wickets for
seven runs ! He distinguished himself, too, with
Lord Sheffield’s eleven, coming out with a batting
average of 39 for all matches, and taking second
place in bowling- records. His highest score is 226
not out for Yorkshire against Leicestershire.
He weighed lOst. 71 b. when he first left Eng-
land with the ’B4 team for Australia; his weight
increased to list. 71b. on the voyage, and he
has never since scaled less than list. He looks
now a pocket Hercules, scales a solid list. 41b.
and stands sft. Gin.
This visit to Australia being his fourth, he
speaks authoritatively when he remarks the won-
derful improvement that the last 10 years have
made in Australian cricket. Here is the substance
of what he said in Sydney the week before last.
“There are 10 cricketers now, in the true sense
of the word, where there was but one in ’B4. Then
we played 15 of South Australia; now out* team
goes down before their eleven. ■ Gregory has come
to the front in the last few years, possessing more
strokes than any other batsman, English or Aus-
tralian. Iredale, too, who bats with an expert’s
skill and vigor, and particularly cuts with a dash
which would rank him a great gun in England.
Then George Giffen, safer than Gregory, though
with fewer strokes ; and withal the champion all-
round cricketer. Turner, also, who has risen to
top eminence as a bowler, being underrated
as a batsman in consequence. And what
great development there has been in Australian
country cricketers ! Game as pebbles, they will
field anything, and will try to catch a cannon-shot'.
Country batsmen force the game, and though none
promise great things, many are very fair bats
indeed. They hit too; they will knock the cover
off soft bowling. I remark, also, that nearly all
the country bowlers make the ball turn well, keep
cool and use their heads. A. B. Trott, of Mel-
bourne, I should select as possibly the most
promising junior.
“There is a marked contrast between English
and Australian batsmen, and considerable dif-
ference between the batsmen of the several
Austral provinces. The Melbourne batsmen cut
more than the Adelaide men, the Sydney men
still more, but the Englishmen are beyond them
all. The Adelaide men have a cramped style,
they never reach out and smother the ball. Theirs
is a style which is safe enough on their fast and
splendid wicket. But I send down balls on the
off to them with impunity, which if bowled to
Stoddart or Iredale would be sent with a swinging
cut like lightning to the boundary. Against
Englishmen, I bowl more on the wicket than I do
against Sydney batsmen, and more on the wicket
against Sydney batsmen than against the batsmen
of the other provinces. I need not say that two
or three Sydney batsmen poke about the wicket
and play a slow game.
“ Among the Brisbane cricketers I should pick
i l * l or a P^ ace any Australian eleven.
iJr. Macdonald can play nicely, but he belongs to
the class of A. Bannerman, Dr. Barrett, and the
Englishman, Barlow.
“An English wicket is very different from an
Australian, and Australian wickets differ from
one another. That of Adelaide is the fastest in
the world ; next come Melbourne and Brisbane,
then Sydney, and compared with Sydney wicket
our English ones are quite slow. The ball
will break no more on the best Australian
pitch than on English ones; but in wet
weather, the ball lodging on the “home”
wickets cuts through,” as the cricket phrase is ;
that is, it chips out a piece of turf. The Aus-
tralian wicket will not chip after rain; but it
becomes sticky, and doesn’t it turn the ball 1 Ask
-turner. When an English wicket is bad it is
more fiery and kicks more than an Australian
wicket, but it turns the ball less. I pitch the ball
shorter here than I do in England, to keep a
good length. All things considered, Australian
Wickets are batsmen’s wickets. Of all cricket-
grounds in the world the Sydney ground is the
prettiest, and greener than any other in Aus-
tralia. It is more suggestive of the deep, rich
greenness of the English turf.”
Thus Peel talked, as he rested, the Sunday
morning after the first two days of the test match.
Like the rest of the Englishmen he had many
words of generous praise for the grand score of
Australians, and thought their chance was
then 100. to 1. Gregory’s innings, he says, is the
feature of the present-tour.
“ 586! I was never so tired as on
Saturday afternoon. When we came in from the
field at the close of that big innings, I was too
done-up to take my boots off. And then three of
our wickets fell for a mere song, and at quarter
past five 1 had to get ready to go in. So I put on
my pads, and stretching myself on a seat in the
dressing-room instantly fell asleep. I cannot
describe how glad I was when Lockwood woke me
at five minutes to six with the welcome news that
I would not be wanted that night. I had bowled
53 overs, and had put every ounce of my strength
into every ball I sent down, and had fielded under
that hot sun my very best. I think the turn of
the game came when we missed the easy chance at
the beginning of Iredale’s innings of running him
or Giffen out. I have often noticed that when a
batsman has a big ‘ let off ’ he invariably makes a
great stand.

Oswald Brown, formerly a South Aus-
tralian civil servant, has been touting at the Im-
perial Institute, London, on behalf of the Chatfeys.
“Young men,” bawls Oswald, “if you ve got any
money, go to Mildura and Renmark, and you can
depend upon securing a healthy livelihood.
Booh ! If you go to gaol, with or without money,
you can depend upon securing a healthy liveli-
ho >d.
The Age concludes an article on the pro-
mises of modern science with some very solemn
reflections, of which this is the gist : What is to
hinder electricity from doing the bidding of some
future anarchist, and blowing an effete civilisation
sky-high ?” Which recalls Charles Lamb’s horror
of matches, and that 11 hellish faculty above gun-
powder” they gave into the hands of the lawless
hind. “Think,” he wrote, “of a disrespected
clod, that was trod into earth, on a sudden by
damned arts refined into an exterminating angel,
devouring the fruits of the earth and their growers
in a mass of fire.” And yet matches are now a
penny a thousand, and the world remains.
When buying The Bulletin at any wharf
or railway-station, make sure, before paying,
that you get the current issue, as a number of
people h°ve been making money by trading off
ancient copies on the unsuspecting.
At Ashfield (Sydney), on Christinas night,
a rejected lover sang “ I’ve just come away from
the inquest,” prior to shooting a bullet into his
heart. The world knows nothing of its greatest
humorists until they are dead.
At a Northern sugar-mill, recently, a
Kanaka came in from the field with a load of cane,
and seeing it was only five minutes to six decided to
hang round the mill till the whistle blew for
knock-off. In the meantime the owner came and
shifted the hands of the clock back. When
Tommy came again to see the time it was only
5.30. Taking the clock the ex-cannibal went
round to the fireman and requested him to open
the furnace-dopr. “What for?” asked the man,
as he complied. “ Burn this up ;no good ;
go backwards,” replied the savage as he threw the
clock into the fire. The erring heathen was
promptly sacked by the indignant proprietor,
who, however, was obliged to send for the local
“ foorce ” to remove him from the premises.
The latest from ’Ome is “ Ballarat Bill,”
by Bracebridge Fleming, a book of the “Dead-
wxid Dick” series,’' now rapidly selling in Aus-
tralia. The scene is laid at Ballarat; the time,
this year. Ballarat is described as being princi-
pally composed of saloons and cowboy toughs
armed with revolvers and bowies—the Australian
practice being, it is said, to carry two of the latter,
one in the belt, the other concealed in the back.
Gold is described as being picked up in lumps in
the bush surrounding the place, and kangaroos
and bushrangers are plentiful within a stone’s
throw. The bushrangers are supplied with
Maxim guns. The outlaws are, of course,
badly whipped, and the very-much-compromised
females rescued. Camping is described as “out-
spanning,” and travelling through the bush is des-
cribed as “trekking”—South African terms.
Absurdities like these and worse abound, but
“ Ballarat Bill ” sells like hot cakes, while locally-
printed books lie mourning on the shelves.
Dear Bulletin, —The “ Song of Father
Duchesne ” reminds me of a ditty I heard in Tas-
mania 14 or 15 years ago. The old fellow who
sang it told me afterwards that it was “as old as
God,” a statement I remember to have doubted.
It is supposed to be sung in a condemned cell by a
prisoner who is very soon to be hanged. The
earlier verses I forget, and remember only that
the sentiments were similar to Father Duchesne’s,
with a few others quite unmentionable. The
concluding verses run this way
The parson he will come, he will come, he will come,
( Repeat )
A digger who returned to Melbourne per
s.s. Innamincka to spend his Xrnas with his
family, from whom he had been absent two years,
relates that, while in the wilderness beyond Cue,
he used to leave a dish of water outside his
tent night and day for the. vagrant birds. He had
often to cart this same water 20 and 30 miles by
camels, but ho had his reward, for the little birds
grew so grateful that they perched on his shoulder
and ncalled in his hands.
Dear Bulletin, —That “record” team-
load fpr one. waggon has been beaten, several
times. In 1890, W. Bonfiejd conveyed 13 tons
15 owt. from the Overflow station to Nyngan (80
miles) in four days, with only 11 horses. In 1893,
C. Johnston delivered in Cowra 14 tons 10 cwt.,
drawn by 24 bullocks. I could mention at least a
dozen more that have gone close to 13 tons, but
the largest load of wOol I ever saw on one waggon
came into Bourke last year. The waggon con-
tained 110 bales—weight 13 tons 4 cwt., from
Tlmrlagoona, Q. — Thomas M'Guikh.
A Victorian country commission agent
lately did some business for a farmer, noted for
his splendid herd of cattle, and was induced to
take “ a fine cow ” in lieu of the commission. The
cow was duly forwarded, and a day or two later
the following letter of acknowledgment came to
hand :
Dear Sir,—Your cow of the 4th inst. reached me to-day,
and I have to thank you for sending such a fine animal.
You said that if I left it to you you would pick out one
specially for me—and you have done so. If it were
quieter and in better condition and gave more milk and
had two eyes instead of one, it might suit me better, but,
I suppose, we cannot have everything we want in this
world. Or if it had been totally blind, one boy might
be able to get it in and milk it ; or else I could
send it on to the Blind Asylum: but, as it is,
I am afraid they would not take it in there. The chief
points about the cow appear to be that it travels well, and
goes over—or through—fences in grand style, and is
always uncertain as to where it is going to. As a speci-
men of your famous herd it has attracted some attention
here. A farmer in the' district' who intends breeding a
superior class of, cattle and was going to see you and
inspect your young stock, took particular notice of it to-
day, but I don’t know whether he will call on you now. I
am afraid, however, that the cow is too valuable and too
well-bred for me, so I shall be glad if you will send for it.
You might take it back and forward me a cheque for
whatever you think it is worth, and I will get a common,
ordinary cow—one that will stand quietly and be milked
and can be caught without the aid of a stockman and
horse. lam not educated up to these high-class animals.
‘—Yours truly, —-.
Dear Bulletin, —It daily grows harder
for the hona-jide bushman to find work in the
country. Besides legions of Melbourne, Ade-
laide and Sydney unemployed, even ex-oivil-
servants are beginning to take his place. Amongst
the men working at a woolscour on the Merri-
Merri there are an ex-post-and-telegraph master,
a railway-guard, a former rabbit-inspector, a
schoolmaster, a bank-accountant, a commission-
agent, and a B.A. of Dublin University ; the
trades of typesetting, bootmaking, painting and
tailoring are also represented. It is enough to
make one wish he was never born when, after
walking through miles of swampy, black-soil
country up to his knees in water, or across a dry,
dead plain under a broiling sun and tormented by
millions of flies, he arrives at a Woolshed half-
dead from hunger or thirst, only to find that a
gang of boxer-hat-wearing, broken-down city men,
who have never seen a sheep shorn, or a tree
rung, or known a day’s real hardship, have gob in
ahead of him by train from Sydney.—6 xB.
The parson he will come and look so horrid glum
And talk of Kingdom Gome—damn his eyes!
The sheriff he’ll come too, he’ll come too, he’ll come too,
( Repeat)
The sheriff he’ll come too, with all his ghastly crew,
His dirty work to do—damn his eyes!
The crowd, O hear them yell, hear them yell, hear them
yell,
(Repeat)
The crowd, O hear them yell, above that cursed bell,
May I meet them all in hell—damn their eyes 1

Rethought I came unto a world-wide plain,

The works of a watch are its
chief essential. The works of
the Apex watch equal in all
regards those of high-class silver
and gold watches costing from
£7 to £l5.
The untarnishable case of the
Apex Watch is of nickel,
beautifully engine- turned, with
star and garter. No more elegant
or compact watch can be bought
for
money.
The Apex Watch is a keyless
short-winder ; ten turns wind it
for 24 hours. The keyless work
is extra strong, with safety barrel.
The watch is thoroughly regu-
lated and timed for immediate
use, and will last as long, with
even the roughest wear, as any
watch for which you pay 20 times
the money.
