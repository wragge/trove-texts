HORSE GUARDS PARADE HAS SEEN THE PAGEANTRY OF ENGLAND
ON the east side of St. James’s Park, in the heart of London, is Horse
Guards Parade, scene of the world-renowned “Trooping of the Colour”;
an annual guard-mounting ceremony dating from about 1750 and performed
in June on the King’s official birthday. The King has a Sovereign's Escort
when he rides to Horse Guards’ Parade, and the March Past of the Guards
in full dress with bearskins, to the music of massed bands, and the clockwork
precision of their drill provide one of the finest military spectacles in the
world. During the King’s inspection the whole parade stands rigidly to
attention for twenty minutes.
Horse Guards Parade was originally part of the Tiltyard of Whitehall
Palace, and extended from the Banqueting Hall, which still exists in Whitehall,
to the present St. James’s Park. It was mentioned by Shakespeare in Act 111
of “King Henry IV.” It was there, in 1540, that Henry VIII held the
tournament to which knights from all over Europe were invited. During
Queen Elizabeth’s reign (1558-1603) her birthday was celebrated annually by
military exercises on Horse Guards Parade. It was the scene, in the reign of
James I (1603-1625), of jousting, at which Prince Charles distinguished himself
on one occasion.
During the American Revolution men were drafted there from the
regiments of foot-guards for service in America. A number of men from each
company was taken and sent over to replace casualties. It was there, also,
that the funeral procession of the Duke of Wellington was formed in 1852.
On State occasions royal salutes are fired from Horse Guards Parade. Rising
from its boundaries are the imposing eighteenth century buildings of the
Admiralty, the Treasury and of the Horse Guards, headquarters of the
Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces. One of the best views in London is of
these buildings from the bridge which spans the lake in St. James’s Park.

KATHERINE MANSFIELD.
Katherine Mansfield’s personal tragedy
was, of course, her battle against con-
sumption—told with cruel and valiant
beauty in the new Katherine Mansfield’s
Letters to John Middleton Murry (Con-
stable)—ending in her death in a French
sanatorium at the age of 34. Her literary
tragedy was that her art was fragmentary,
brittle, unfinished.
She left a surprisingly large collection
of stories, her notebooks and (with others
that have been published previously) this
enormous volume of letters ; nothing that
she wrote was not lit with a rare and
delicate genius ; but one looks in vain for
the single solid achievement —the novel
or the group of stories —which would
set her securely in place as she is doubt-
less secure in time.
In part it is a tragedy of expatriation.
All through the letters, making a kind of
lyrical theme through the book, and a
very attractive one for this part of the
world, her love for New Zealand keeps
coming to the surface. “Oh, God,” she
wrote in 1914 from the south of France,
“this place is as fair as New Zealand to
me, as apart, as secret, as much a place
where you and I are alone and un-
troubled” ; and Murry comments in
one of his admirably clear and unobtru-
sive notes, “The south of France was,
ever since she first lived in it, more con-
genial to her than any part of England,
which was always my country rather
than hers. The south of France was
much more like New Zealand, which had
been her home, and which now had be-
come the home of her imagination also.”
In France again in 1918 she was read-
ing Wordsworth and “a description in a
N.Z. letter of how to grow that neglected
vegetable the Kohlrabi. I never heard a
wilder, fiercer night; but it can’t quench
my desire —my burning desire to grow
this angenhrne vegetable, with its fringe
of outside leathery leaves, and its heart
which is shaped and formed and of the
same size as the heart of a turnip .” In
Cornwall later the same year, “The sea
and the coastline remind me curiously
of New Zealand, and my old servant is
like an old woman down the Pelorus
Sounds (my dream N.Z. and dream old
woman, of course).”
She wore a “New Zealand stone” (a
tiki? or a greenstone ring?), and delighted
in an old Cornishwoman who, recognis-
ing its origin and learning that she came
from Wellington, asked her if she knew
“a Mr. Charles William Smith, a cousin
of mine, who was residing there in
1869.”
The novel she began to write, which
eventually broke up into short-stories,
was set in New Zealand ; the most com-
plete of her stories of action as well as
the most sensitive of her childhood
studies are set in New Zealand. She
might well have done for New Zealand
what Henry Handel Richardson did for
Australia.
In a way she did more, for she has
probably a far wider European reputa-
tion than the Australian and of course
her writing is altogether finer. Beside her
impetuous prose The Fortunes of Richard
Mahony lumbers along like a carthorse.
Yet there is certainly no group of her
stories which you could put together
and say, in the large way you could say
it of Henry Handel Richardson’s Aus-
tralia, “Here is Katherine Mansfield’s
New Zealand.” To come into her own
field of the short-story, she did not
“create” New Zealand in the way
Maupassant created his France, Conrad
his ocean or Chekhov —her favorite —his
Russia. Her collected stories give a
curious impression of rootlessness: of life
seen in a brilliant flash from the window
of a moving train.
But, quite apart from the facts that New
Zealand in its cultural backwardness was
almost an impossible place for a creative
artist to live in and that Katherine Mans-
field had no serious intention of ever
returning—it was a dream, “very far off ;
I want Sussex and cows and you”—it is
easy to exaggerate the importance of
expatriation. After all, it was from
England that Henry Handel Richardson
created her Australia; from New
Zealand that Eve Langley created another
Australia ; and, had there not been other
obstacles besides mere physical separa-
tion, Katherine Mansfield could very well
have written about New Zealand in
Sussex or Cornwall or Italy or the south
of France or Switzerland, wherever she
happened to be . . . wherever she could
settle down.
But the trouble was, she couldn’t settle ;
not anywhere: either to write about New
Zealand or, since a narrow regionalism
is not finally important, to present any
firm and sustained and broad picture of
life in a firm, broad and sustained artistry.
It is a restless, haunted and feverish
existence shown in the Letters. There
was the turmoil of the set she got into in
London—trying to break into the inner
circles of literary power and influence
and at once “loathing” the “London
Mercury” and longing to have a serial
published in it; separating themselves in
“disgust” from the rest of the community
in war-time; tormenting themselves with
perpetual analysis of their love-affairs ;
the advance - guard of the period
dominated by the demonic genius of
Lawrence. And then, the disease grip-
ping her while she was in poverty in
France during the war, there was her
tuberculosis driving her from lodging-
house to lodging-house, cottage to
cottage, country to country, sanatorium
to sanatorium, never except in brief
intervals allowing her that “blissful
peace” she needed for the fulfilment of
her art. A brilliant and slender flame,
too bright for New Zealand as it then
was, beating up against the darkness of
Europe in the Great War and its after-
math, and far too soon extinguished . . .
Middleton Murry, incidentally, had no
faith in the “mystical” cures for which,
near the end, she abandoned the moun-
tains of Switzerland.
The Letters to John Middleton Murry
are, primarily, a love-story ; perhaps, in
their totality, a great love-story.
Certainly some of them will be reprinted
whenever anthologies are made of the
world’s most memorable love-letters.
Though they are frank and intimate in
expression, with passages expurgated
from the previous general collec-
tion now restored (new letters to
Murry are added, and letters to other
friends omitted), they are not —except for
one slightly absurd episode when
Katherine Mansfield temporarily left
Murry for some French novelist with
whom she thought she was in love—what
is tailed “scandalous.” They are not full
of the dramatic action of “scenes” and
quarrels and jealousies like the story of
Lawrence’s love-affairs, for the very good
reason that during most of their associa-
tion, both before and after their marriage,
Murry and Katherine Mansfield lived
apart—either he would be seeking money
for them to live on in some new job, or
she would be off to France or Italy or
Switzerland for her health. The love-
story itself does not finally mount to a
crisis of tragedy ; for though Katherine
was in his arms when death came to her
—“We can sit and drink kiftir in the
cowshed,” she had written, inviting him
to the Gurdjieff Institute; but the night
he arrived she collapsed with, “I believe
I’m going to die”-—they had drifted apart
towards the end, emotionally as well as
geographically. But Katherine Mans-
field’s personal story is tragic, and out
of that comes the vivid and disastrous
intensity of the letters: a genuine tender-
ness sharpened by separation and made
desperate by disease. The happy lyricism
of:
All the rest of the day I do not know
how I have spent it —such a lovely wild
day brimming over with color and light.
I have found the shortest way to our home
by a road you do not know, through fields
of jonquils and past the olive-trees that
blow so silver and black today. There are
high walls on the road and nobody goes.
I thought; ‘We shall stand here and kiss
each other.’ Then I thought: ‘But if we
do, I think I shall faint for joy.’
And the torment of :
I arrived, and found I was to be here
(without a word explaining why this change
had been) at least tour months, until the
late autumn. No word of your coming,
no word of anything else. It was a sort of
ultimate comble. It knocked me back on
to my own lonely self. I was in despair, as
you know, and 1 saw Life quite differently.
I felt that if all I had oh so passionately
pleaded and protested without shame or
fear about my love —my longing for married
life —as soon as possible —was to be just
delayed, not understood —I could endure no
more, and I fell into the dark hollow which
waits for roe always... .So now, please
God, let us be calm again. / will not be
sad. Let us be calm. Let our love keep
us quiet and safe —like two children in a
great big quiet field —sitting there hidden
in the flowers and grasses. O thou who
hast all of my heart. Accept me. lam
simply and for ever your own.
As well as this great central drama of
love and death, and the minor but still
significant current of nostalgia for New
Zealand, there are, of course, a number
of subsidiary themes to be followed with
pleasure or interest through the Letters:
notably Katherine Mansfield’s contacts
with or comments on her contemporaries,
and her notes on literature in general.
Lawrence, who was probably jealous
of her friendship with Murry, as she
was of his, and who could apparently be
by turns the best and worst of com-
panions, shows through the book at his
very blackest, nothing less than fiendish
in the letter that Katherine Mansfield
said he had “dragged like a reptile ’
across her life:
I want to mention something else.
Lawrence sent me a letter today. He spat
in my face and threw filth at me and said:
“I loathe you. You revolt me stewing
in your consumption... .The Italians were
quite right to have nothing to do with
you,” and a great deal more. Now 1 do
beseech you, if you are my man, to stop
defending him after that and never to crack
him up in the paper. Be proud I In the
same letter he said his final opinion of you
was that you were “a dirty little worm.”
Well, be proud. Don’t forgive him for
that, please.
There is Hugh Walpole—“Oh dear, I’m
afraid Walpole is having his birthday-
cake far too soon —what a surprise for
them when we sit down at the heads of
their tables, all among their cake crumbs
and groaning little tummies —you with a
laurel wreath on your darling head, and
me trailing a perfectly becoming cloud
of glory.” There is the Oxford Book of
English Verse, which Katherine Mansfield
found dull and full of fake poetry; poor
Jack London —“No, a little Shakspeare
makes one’s nose too fine for such a rank
smeller as Jack London”; Yeats, whom
she disliked so much for the spurious
element in his mysticism that she wanted
Middleton Murry to “pull his nose”
(along with, for no stated reason, the
august and perilous proboscis of Conrad);
Duhamel, whose novels she admired very
much ; Ezra Pound—“small beer” ; Shaw,
clever but “not inspired, not an artist”;
Firbank — "Please don’t praise Firbank”;
Huxley, “very silly and young sometimes
—and watery-headed” ; Masefield, “Here
is anatomy of description instead of
creative power : it comes, of course, from
a weakness of creative power” ... a
strange mixture of sound and unsound
criticism, rather malicious when it is all
put together, too much based on the rage
of the literary newcomer against the gang
in power; but then it was all said in
private letters, not meant for publica-
tion, and often originated as a loyal
defence of Murry against his critics and
rivals ; and Katherine Mansfield could be
quite as unreasonably severe on her own
writing as she was, say, on Yeats —she
thought Bliss was "trivial” and the
German Pension “far too immature” to
reprint.
In the comments on literature in general
there is the same mixture of acuteness
and prejudice: arising, fundamentally,
from the obligation to protect her own
art in its dazzling and uncertain fluidity.
As she abhorred Conrad, so she detested
Maupassant, giving all her allegiance in
the short-story to Chekhov: a viewpoint
which cannot be reconciled with her
delightful enthusiasm for Dickens, except
on the understanding that her own art,
taking body and movement from Dickens,
whom she was “not reading idly,” needed
to develop towards a practical story-telling
more like the art of Maupassant and
Conrad than she cared to recognise . . .
though no doubt the immediate attrac-
tion of Dickens lay in the wildness, the
freedom, the high spirits, which she could
not find in the graver art of Conrad and
which had their feminine counterpart in
the more delicate freedom of her own
writing.
On the whole, except with Dickens,
she is happier with the poets than the
prose-writers: Shakspeare, whom she read
at all times with devotion and delight;
Shelley, Wordsworth, Keats, Coleridge,
Chaucer —“1 read today The Tale of
Chaunticleer and Madame Perlicote: it’s
the Pardouner’s tale. Perfect in its way.
But the personality —the reality of the
man. How his impatience, his pleasure,
the very tone rings through. It’s deep
delight to read. Chaucer and Marlowe
are my two at present.” She wrote, inci-
dentally, a fine and moving poem herself,
quoted in these Letters, which in spite
of some technical roughness, might well
be given a place in New Zealand antho-
logies. It describes how Death came to
her as a new husband when Murry
wouldn’t, and it had a “shattering” effect
on Murry, who hadn’t realised how deep
was her despair at that time (1919):
Someone came to me and said
Forget, forget that you’ve been wed.
Who’s your man to leave you be
(Red Page continued on inside back

Where once the grey scrub’s finches cried
with thin
voices through the heat their *‘nin-nin-

Here to the fettlers’ sunken water-tank
the blacks came in; their three dun camels
sank
down to their knees; the tall and bearded
blacks
unslung the water-drums tied to the packs,
filled them, and called their camels and
were gone
to where, out on the iron plain, led on
their lubras, children and lean dogs ... to

always the evening ranges’ ebb and flow,
the shifting sands that bare the parched

MIRACLE.
She takes the whitest bread*
The Maid of every moon,
Sweet from her heart’s own fire
At the high hour of day
Or at the midnight’s noon.
She blesses with a wish
The loaf that multiplies
And golden baskets fill
With beauty’s miracle,
Love feeds the hungry still.

THE ENDEAVOUR IN HAURAKI
GULF.
[From “Tamaki-Makau-Rau.”]
Suddenly yawned the coast and offered a
bay’s
large invitation glossed with morning
dazzle
and were under sail or moored for seven
days
where the broken shore line set for us a
puzzle;
what would we find beyond this coiled
recess
where serpent water’s bright mercurial
scales
flicker between the mainland and the isles
and rounding promontories twist out of
sight?
The head a dreaming harbor is my guess.
The tail explored by pinnace where it
curled
through mangrove and green mud to
crystal waters
brought us through the singing woods of
unbuilt cities
and spars enough for ships of all the world-
By caravan gateways in their reed-thatched
town
traded with the people like and dis-like;
spike nail for whalebone spear;
eyes assessing glances darkly cautious,
glistening smile betrayed by murderous
frown.
What name has this place? O say it again
we who are strangers have the stranger’s
ear
for native syllables. It is the quill's
turn to stammer Ooahaouragee. We can
say “Thames.’’
Then making sail plied up the shining bay
to lay the channel bare;
it seemed the serpent raised its angry head
for levin tongues went darting through the
masts
and thunder roared, the dark winds
trumpeted:
Not you, not now, not here!
A man who knows his place in time’s
contents
does not beat windward to these argu-
ments. |
!
Weighed in a wild dawn-
the mountain knuckling clouds gave us
goodbye
and the coast unfurled its challenge. Blow,
sails, on,
and leave the serpent water curled in sleep:
it shall not long escape the adventurer’s
eye
whether he comes to sow—and stays to
reap,
or fogged in London calculates afar
the fortunes of a mercenary star.

CLOUD IN THE ORIENT.
The rapid industrial progress of Japan
is a warning of what must happen to
sluggard nations in the vicinity of Asia.
It is also a lesson illustrating the paradox
that conquest, so far from suppressing
great modern nations, fires them with a
new urge to live and expand. This has
been proved after two wars in Western
Europe as well as in Asia. The one
country in Europe which is not better
off than in 1945 is Britain, the only one
never invaded and never vanquished.
If ever a nation should have been
beaten into the ground in 1945 it was
Japan. Its maritime empire was
destroyed, its navy and its mercantile
marine, its military and civil air-power
completely wiped out. Its cities were
bombed and blasted from one end of
its islands to the other. Its vast indus-
trial plants were made unworkable with
the blowpipe in Osaka, in Kobe, in
Kure, Hiroshima and a dozen other
cities. Hundreds of square miles of its
industrial areas had been put to the torch
and razed to the ground. Its food-supply
was at danger-level. The average Jap-
anese was in rags.
The whole commercial and financial
system of the Empire was overthrown,
and the landed estates throughout the
main islands divided up and given over
to new owners under a new system.
Taxation reached limits which would
have seemed unbearable to a spoilt
British-speaking race. Official food levies
on the farmers left them in many cases
barely enough to keep themselves and
their families alive.
Added to all this Japan lost Formosa,
the Ryukyus, Korea, Manchuria, numer-
ous adjacent groups of islands valuable to
her fisheries, a vital source of food-supply,
and the mandated islands. Also the
nation’s world trade.
It faces this situation with a popula-
tion which was computed last year at
83,200,000 (already 587 to the square
mile), increasing at the rate of just on
2.000. a year. It has next to no agri-
cultural machinery or farm livestock, and
only about 16 per cent, of its land area,
about 15,000,000 acres, is arable. Its
fishing catch, before the war about
7.000. tons (or more than half the
world catch), has dwindled by over half.
It turns off about 14,000,000 tons of
grains, mostly rice, in the main from
farms as small as suburban lots —in 1947
there were 3,500,000 families farming
plots of under 2.4 acres.
That is the general situation with the
machinery potential of staple trading
industries such as rayon and cotton and
wool-spinning still at one-third pre-war
capacity in 1949. At the same time the
Japanese ended the war with nearly
8.000. tons open-hearth capacity intact
in the steel industry and nearly 7,000,000
tons rolling-mill capacity.
Their industrial morale, however, re-
mained at 100 per cent., and its effect
is already making itself felt, even though
the ink on the Japanese peace-treaty
is hardly yet dry. A correspondent of
the “S. M. Herald” who reported some
of the impacts of Japanese recovery from
New York last week declared that
“American businessmen’s fears that cheap
Japanese imports would soon overwhelm
the United States domestic market are
coming true faster than even the most
pessimistic predicted.” Cases were cited
in which the Japanese exports are mak-
ing alarming inroads into numerous
United States home markets —e.g., for
textile products and sewing-machines,
in which they have already captured 25
per cent, of the United States domestic
trade by selling at half the price of the
U.S. machine. The same sort of thing
is happening in the optical and pottery
industries and in toys, in rayons and silk.
Already 25 Japanese freighters are
reported to be operating in the American
trade —at the end of 1948 all the ships
the Japanese were building were small
300-ton wooden coastal vessels. They
now are able with the huge docks of
Kure, in which war vessels up to the
70,000-ton Yamato were laid down, to
compete in shipbuilding at prices a
quarter to half below the quotations of
English-speaking countries. They already
have several important constructional
contracts, including some involving the
building of three of the world’s largest
oil-tankers, each 38,000 tons.
The situation is alarming to all nations,
but especially to countries like Australia.
Before 1939 Japan found the greater part
of its trade outlets in Asia, so much so
that it did not suffer fatally from the
effects of protective tariffs imposed on
its cheap-labor goods by high-cost pro-
ducing European countries. But with
some of its main customers immured
behind the Iron Curtain it must turn to
the Western markets. Export industries
are the very life-blood of its continued
existence. And the West cannot protect
itself without running the risk of creat-
ing a situation which will throw Japan
into the arms of the Communist bloc as
the only chance of survival. Even com-
petition with the West in export markets
in the British-Asian Dominions, in South
America and in Indonesia must have
results which will be felt in every home
in those parts of the world inhabited by
Europeans.
European and American industry,
wherever in vital conflict with the
Japanese, especially in the export
trade, can maintain its hold only by
bringing costs of production down to a
competitive level. That is very nearly
impossible even with tariff assistance on
the basis of existing Europeanised living
standards. And if it were feasible it
would at once face Japan with the need
to accept the one possible alternative to
world trade presented—to join the
Asiatic Communist bloc in return for
access to Asian mainland markets, and
for military aid and support to secure
lands in which to keep alive a popula- •
tion growing at the rate of about 12 to
the square mile per annum on current
figures.
The trade future, so long as Japanese
living standards and views on the virtues
of hard work continue to be what they
are, is somewhat gloomy, especially for
a country like Australia living in a
beautiful day-dream while the kind wool-
buyers shovel gold into its lap.
Whatever else happens, it seems more
than possible that within measurable time
Japanese entry into world trade may start
a commercial war which will send prices
toppling everywhere, apart from de-
priving us directly of a lot of little
markets created since the war which add
up to something substantial and important
in the aggregate.
Also, as past experience has shown,
the Japanese have a powerful bargaining
argument, when world conditions are
reasonably normal, in their potential as
buyers of Australian raw materials. The
wool industry had some experience of
that phase of Japanese competition in
the ’thirties, and the country should have
a prepared policy to meet it again along
with all the other reactions of Japanese
re-entry into world competition by which
we have not yet been directly touched,
but which must have their impact sooner
or later.
Complacent Paralysis.
A common post-war tendency in Aus-
tralia and in Britain has marked a
distinct divergence from lines followed in
Canada and South Africa. Britain, Aus-
tralia and New Zealand gave themselves
over to Socialism, to what the Attlee
Government’s leading propagandist called
“the Great Experiment.” The “welfare
State” was its preoccupation, an extension
of the Rooseveltian New Deal in U.S.A.,
and the chosen means to that end were
“full employment” the deliberate
creation of a condition of more jobs than
workers —the expropriation of “capital,”
nationalisation of industries in a planned
sequence, cheap and plentiful money,
higher wages for less work, subsidising of
commodity-prices, and largesse for the
multitude in pensions, housing, medical
benefits, insurance, and so forth. Infla-
tion followed inevitably and with mount-
ing force ; indeed, it was part of the pro-
cess. The result was what the late Mr.
Chifley saluted in Australia as “the
golden age.” There was more tinsel about
it than gold; the glass in which the
masses saw their modern economic con-
ditions was, as the London “Times” justly
says, a distorting-mirror.
For nearly three years now it has been
pretty plain that the socialisation experi-
ment in Britain was a costly failure.
During that time it has dragged on only
because of the subsistence derived from
gifts and loans from America —through
Marshall aid and other channels —
amounting, it is calculated, to about
£2,000,000,000. The awakening came
earlier in Australia and New Zealand, in
both of which the Socialists have been
defeated twice at successive general
elections in quick sequence. For the
socialisation experiment in these
Dominions —demonstrations on “a mere
laboratory scale” as the Attlee Govern-
ment’s apologist declared—there was no
foreign subsidisation as in Britain ; and
the Australian and New Zealand elections
since 1949 could be read, and doubtless
were read by many, as a direct signal to
the British people to follow suit while
a chance of solvency might permit.
The election in Britain was fought on
the Socialist breakdown. The “‘Man-
chester Guardian” on the eve of the poll
said it had no love for the Tories, but a
Conservative Government “might lift the
country out of its complacent paralysis.”
Mr. Asquith’s daughter, Lady Bonham-
Carter, told a Liberal meeting—“l feel as
though the whole nation has got the
cramp.” Mr. Churchill said in a final
address—“ You have a decision to make
....not just to flop about this way or
that with some meaningless verdict which
leaves us all hanging on in this present
miserable condition.” He added:
All around us the world is waiting to see
Britain and the British Commonwealth of
Nations take their part again in the great
world system from which we have dropped
appreciably in recent years. Give us a
solid, stable Government not occupied in
trying to ram its opinions down other
people’s throats, but trying to raise our
country to the splendid and glorious posi-
tion which she occupied and which she can
speedily regain if we all act together.
Obviously the British Commonwealth
could not act together to restore British
prestige, nor the mooted Anglo-American
partnership to secure world-peace, nor
could Britain surmount its accumulated
economic problems, while the United
States and Canada regarded with increas-
ing distaste and dismay the Socialist
ruination of Britain and her international
influence, and Britain itself was split from
top to bottom with the most bitter party
strife over the remedies for its economic
decline. In this “complacent paralysis”
the Communist war-planners in Moscow
were winning their ends without open
hostilities ; the cold war they had insemi-
nated through the socialisation campaign
in the most British countries of the
British Commonwealth was doing their
work for them. Of the homeland Mr.
Churchill said:
A fifth of our industries have been
nationalised, and this is the part which is
lagging behind. The export trade, by
which we live, and the vast mass of our
production, which paid its way, was made
by the other four-fifths on which Socialism
has not yet laid its clumsy, partisan and
rigid grip. The free-enterprise four-fifths
pays for the Socialist errors and yet has
enough so far to keep us going by a
narrow margin.... A far richer harvest
would have been reaped by our hard-
working people if they had not been
hampered by doctrinaire experiments, mis-
guided planning and astonishing financial
mismanagement and waste.
But the worst consequence of the
Socialist class-war is the malaise, the
cramp, the sense of failure thrown over
all industry. In Britain as in Australia
and New Zealand the political mounte-
banks directing the Socialist regime had
come to the end of their tether. Even
their supporters were in revolt, angered
by the afflictions of that inflation by
which the Socialists meant to level all in-
comes, and by the incitements of Com-
munist infiltrators who urged as a next
step that union executives should take
over the government of the country. It
sounded like an echo from our own
Socialist-blighted land to hear the secre-
tary of the British Railwaymen’s Union
denouncing as “an absolute disgrace”
that “the administration of the national-
ised railways was such that goods had to
be moved by road,” the failure of the
Government to supply houses, the
miserably low rate of cargo-discharges in
British ports compared with Rotterdam,
the restrictive practices limiting output,
the opposition to labor-saving devices,
the lightning strikes on executive order
to enforce wages demands in defiance of
wage-contracts. All this is part of the
paralysis, infection from the expectation
under the Socialist “welfare State” of
freedom to loaf without intermission of
increases in wages, of easy jobs for ever.
In this distortion-mirror the concept of
the “welfare State” has been made to
seem unreal. Like Australia, Britain has
precious little time left in which to correct
an unbalanced growth of production,
reflecting other distortions, before German
and Japanese competition, untrammelled
by the clogs and shackles of Socialist
centralisation, works up to full tempo
in the international trading market.
In the later stages of the British election
campaign it seemed to observers, as it did
during the Australian elections also, that
there was some “muting of the challenge”
(a phrase from the “Times”), sympto-
matic of a fear, in the crucial issue, of
“throwing the opportunity away by saying
too much.” True, Mr. Churchill promised
only hard times and hard work before
the nation can recover, as also did Mr.
Menzies and Mr. Holland on our own
side of the world. But in no instance
has the leader who has impeached “the
soft economy,” the industrial
which has been de-vitalising the nation'
under the Socialists, explained to the
electors the lines of the sounder, tougher,
more competitive economy that his
Government must implement if it is to
survive more than this Parliamentary
term.
One thing is certain: there can be no
hope for the British recovery of economic
and political strength so long as extremist
union executives defy both the law and
the “welfare State” by such acts as the
throwing idle of the Newcastle steelworks
last week or the British docks a few
months ago, without a pretence of resort
to statutory remedies for a grievance.
German and Japanese competition will
see to that. As for combating inflation,
no Government elected to clean up the
Socialists’ mess has yet proposed to try
the effect of abolishing all controls, regu-
lations, price-subsidies, import-permits,
export-quotas and other cost-raising inter-
ferences with trade, and letting business
enterprise see what it can do unimpeded
to reduce shortages as well as the whole
cockeyed crisis-complex which is the
Socialists’ legacy in our industrial lives.
Land Grab.
He was one of the first three to select
land in what is now known as the
Wakool district in N. S. Wales. The
year was 1876 ; he was 19, with little
capital, but his courage and hopes were
limitless.
He married early, and in the course of
the years had eight children. He had
no personal experience of the free educa-
tion for which he was taxed, but he did
his best to see that his children should
not grow up unable to read and write.
The older ones learnt at home. His two
elder sons worked with him from the age
of 10.
These children also were pioneers who
did their share, and more, in the opening-
up of virgin country. They rarely saw
anybody outside their own family,
Deniliquin, the nearest town, was
at the end of a journey of 40 miles in
a one-horse vehicle. Unless sick, the
children never saw it.
In due course the boy of 19 won out.
His property was free of debt. It was
freehold—and he was past 50. A few
years later he died, leaving his property,
Merriginnie, in trust for his children, his
widow to have the benefit of it during
her lifetime.
A quarter of a century later (in 1945)
Merriginnie came up for distribution
amongst the children, but by this time
the Government of N. S. Wales had had
it proclaimed for resumption for soldier-
settlement.
Some years elapsed. Nothing was
done. The children were not allowed to
sell it on the open market, and the Gov-
ernment wouldn’t settle up.
In June, 1949, the Government was
prepared to discuss the price to be
given. It would only give £4 12s. an
acre for land (worth £10) and for which
anybody in the district wanting land
would give £lO. Still, the court has
recently upheld the validity of land-
resumption at the “1942 value.”
The Government claims that the added
value was entirely due to the irrigation
which had been laid out throughout the
Wakool area and for which the tax-
payers paid. This is not so. Land has
doubled, and in some cases trebled, in
value irrespective of whether it is situated
in an irrigation area or not, or even
likely to be. Eventually the children of
the man who, with their aid and that of
his wife, had built up a fine property
were ordered to be out by January 4,
1950.
One son paid a deposit on a small
property in the district (but not in the
irrigation area) approximately the same
acreage as his share of Merriginnie. It
cost him per acre double the amount he
was to receive for this share. A clearing
sale of stock and plant was held on
December 20, 1949, and he got out.
It soon became clear the Government
was not paying for Merriginnie on his
leaving it, and to save his deposit this
son had to borrow money. A court case
to test the validity of the resumption of
land at less than its value came along
early in 1950. The Government lost. It
then brought down a bill to make it
valid, having the full co-operation of
the Opposition on the understanding that
fair and just prices were paid.
Meanwhile the owners of Merriginnie
had no money to buy stock and make a
start, and the place lay idle, a whole year's
income—the lamb and wool cheques—
running down the sink.
On October 31, 1950, the McGirr
Government deigned to notice those it
had dispossessed and set about the
preparations for the settling of soldiers.
But still no money, nor any suggestion


about compensation for the year’s income
it had deprived the owners of.
The son, who had been bom on Merri-
ginnie more than 60 years ago and who
had worked on it child, youth and man,
had no living and had interest to meet,
so it was hard labor for him again. 1 am
speaking now especially of the member
of the family to whom I am married.
In April, 1951, 16 months after the
old pioneer’s family had had to get out
of Merriginnie, the Government sent a
document to be signed, after which the
owners would be paid for the property.
Amongst much, this document embodied
the price to be given—the original
£4 12s. an acre, and not the fair and just
one promised to the Opposition when the
bill was brought down to legalise the
resumption of land. There was no men-
tion of any compensation for the loss of
our living for 1950.
The family wouldn’t sign at first, but
recently they gave up the unequal struggle
and did sign. On top of all this, the
Government sold an unimproved area of
Merriginnie, isolated from the main pro-
perty, for £6 ss. an acre.
Does democracy mean one law for the
people and another for the Government’s
elected?
It is now two years since the pioneer’s
children were ordered out of the property
he and they had slogged to build up, and
they haven’t been paid, in addition to
having lost a year’s income.
It is all for the returned soldiers, it
may be said. If it is only the land-
owners who are being called upon to
compensate the soldiers, that is their mis-
fortune. But what about the man who
worked all his life in Merriginnie and
whose only two sons are servicemen,
one Mid'dle East and New Guinea, the
other the Navy, and who is on active
service in Korean waters today? If the
man who, as a child, helped to pioneer
the settling of a district is of no account
in comparison with the returned soldiers,
what about his sons? Through him they
have been robbed to compensate their
mates.
I would add that not one acre of
Merriginnie was squatted on. Every acre
has been paid for.
K. FAULKS.
PLAIN ENGLISH
From Kaesong to Ankara.
Korea and Egypt have, for the present,
pushed Persia off the front news-pages ;
but Dr. Moussadek sits in Washington pro-
longing the discussion about his country’s
oil “rights” and the plant at Abadan rots.
A plot has been unearthed which pro-
vided for the Russian Army to invade
Persia on the excuse of British aggression
if force should be used at Abadan; and
Russia has been clearing population out
of the area along the Turkish border and
has sent Turkey an ultimatum warning
her and asking her for “an explanation”
of her action in joining the Atlantic Pact.
Korea’s peace discussions have waxed
and waned. Whatever the reporters of
events are short of in the war area they
never run out of hope. Anybody with
knowledge of Communist technique
knows that the whole plan of a truce
discussion was initiated to provide a plat-
form for propaganda, and for nothing
else. It is obvious that if the Americans
agreed to all demands except one for
abject withdrawal of U.N.O. forces the
Communists would still find an obstacle
to agreement.
They have, as usual, found one in the
present discussions in their scheme to
include Kaesong in the truce area, and
this has become the subject of wearisome
bargaining. It is quite clear that while
details of this sort can hang up an
approach to agreement at a time when
the largest aerial battles of the war are
on and hundreds of men are being killed
every day the position is pretty hopeless.
In Egypt the labor boycott and
terrorism are bringing loading activities
at Port Said and elsewhere to a stand-
still. British troops are being flown in
in considerable numbers, and there are
now over 70,000 in the Canal Zone and
the Sudan. Latest arrivals during the
week were battalions of the Grenadiers
and Coldstreamers and the Cameron
Highlanders.
Meanwhile M. Schuman, the French
Foreign Minister, forecast during the
week a move for peace by the three great
Western Powers, which, he declared,
would “cause a world sensation.”
It will have to be something to do with
a racehorse if his hopes are to be
realised in Australia. On all other sub-
jects, excepting, perhaps, Bikini swim-
suits, Australia takes events in its stride.
There is little realisation here of the
grim unity of events abroad with the
long-term plans of Moscow, whose rulers
act, as do their Australian agents.
“according to the principles of Marxism-
Leninism.” As far as what is
happening in Asia and North Africa
today is concerned, those principles were
laid down by Lenin himself in 1923 —
“The road from Moscow to Paris passes
through Peking, Tokyo and Calcutta.”
On December 24, 1950, two days before
Mao Tse-tung sent a telegram to the
head of the French Communist party
acknowledging Stalin as the leader of the
world Communist forces, Peking Radio
openly declared its purpose in the Korean
war and other moves: “The liberation
of all Asia is the sole mission of the
Chinese Communist party.”
Every day the slow preparation for the
coming “world revolution” grows nearer
to its culmination.
Tattoos and Recruiting.
The three sessions of the tattoo of
Eastern Command at Sydney Show-
ground last week were an encouraging
cross-section of the changes which have
come over Australian defence during the
past two years.
The tattoo was re-established after the
war with greater courage than resources,
and for the first four years of its new
manifestations was a higher tribute to
the size of the hearts of the organisers
than to the size of the forces and their
equipment. This year’s version was im-
posing in every way, and heartening as a
sign of the times. More than
2000 troops took part, including Korean
veterans and a full battalion of National
Service troops fresh from their three
months in camp.
If the new system turns out youngsters
to this soldierly standard in so short a
period in camp it will have justified itself
to the fullest.
The whole exhibition was a fine
tribute to the efficiency, keenness and in-
genuity of the organisers, but perhaps its
most remarkable feature was the surge
of youth among the 120,000 onlookers
who packed the grounds for three nights
running. The attendances were pre-
dominantly in the service age-groups and
augur well for the new recruiting
campaign which is to open under the
supervision of Lieutenan t-General
Robertson when he returns to Australia
after five years’ service in command of
8.C.0.F.
It seems a pity that similar displays
cannot be staged as an accessory to re-
cruiting throughout the country. They
would scarcely be more expensive than
the advertising campaigns which are the
standby of recruiting authorities and
which are inclined to repel by their
spruiker-like urging and their appeal to
personal interest instead of to patriotism.
What is needed is something to stir the
spirit and the blood of youth rather than
their reason and bump of advantage.
And any youth who was not stirred by
this year’s Eastern Command tattoo must
have had a fish for a father.
New Zealand's Way.
They are able to do these things more
easily in N.Z., as witness the Holland
Government’s new legislation to defeat
subversive propaganda and sedition. No
limited powers with the National Parlia-
ment there, and no inhibitions against
proclaiming a situation of “danger to
public safety” because of inadequate
peace-time defence powers.
Prime Minister Holland's new bill, in-
troduced into Parliament at the end of
October, and coming after a conference
with the chief of the British secret in-
telligence service (he has business in
Canberra also), is designed to ram home
the defeat of the Communist transport
strike and equip the Government to meet
in advance any future threat of the sort.
It embraces most of the provisions of
the Australian Crimes Act, but without
that statute’s limitations, especially in the
industrial sections specifying strikes and
lockouts in restraint of inter-State com-
merce (the length of the Commonwealth’s
constitutional tether). For seditious acts
or incitement in spoken or printed publi-
cation the penalties proposed are lighter
than in Australia; but the industrial
offences cover picketing, violence or in-
timidation of individuals, exposing any
citizen to hatred or contempt (the “scab”-
charging technique), declaring things
“black,” processions or demonstrations,
or any other “offence prejudicial to public
safety or the maintenance of public order
or to excite hostility or ill-will between
different classes, so as to endanger public
safety.”
Mr. Holland announced that he pro-
posed to strengthen and reorganise N.Z.’s
security service and make it directly re-
sponsible to himself; for completeness,
he said, “there must be the closest col-
laboration between the British Common-
wealth countries”:
From a knowledge of what is going on,
I can say that New Zealand must guard
Rjfalnst this insidious underground
activity, a sample of which we saw being
tried out during the recent industrial
crisis.
Meanwhile, in an acrimonious washing-
up of its second election defeat the N.Z.
“Labor” party has received a report by
its committee that its campaign conductors
underestimated both public resentment
against the Commos (“the Red scare”
was the “Labor” phrase) and the public
approval of the Government’s action
under emergency regulations during the
strike. In plain words, “Labor” fell down
completely by taking up the Commos’
cause as its own.
Is "Labor" Going Commo?
If. as is allegedly believed by “right-
wing” members of the Canberra caucus,
the witch-hunt against Mr. Chambers,
M.P. for Adelaide, was instigated by Mr.
Clyde Cameron, M.P. for Hindmarsh, as
a corollary to the banning by the A.L.P.
convention (S.A. branch) of A.L.P.
anti-Communist industrial groups in that
State, then Dr, Evatt as party leader may
either have to risk asserting his authority
or let the Left-wing comrades run “the
movement.”
Mr. Chambers’s offence is that he failed
to participate in the “No” campaign at
the referendum on the anti-Communist
Bill. He is an ex-president of the A.L.P.
in S.A., a member of the “Labor” Parlia-
mentary executive, and a front-Opposition-
bench member as an ex-Minister. He is
also palpably a barracker for the anti-
Communist industrial groups in the
“Labor” party, the bodies organised to
“fight Communism” within the industrial
wing of the party, formally blessed by
Mr. Chambers’s late leader as Prime
Minister, and boosted everywhere during
the referendum campaign by Dr. Evatt
and other “Labor” leaders as the witness
of how “Labor” was equipped to “defeat
Communism by democratic means.”
The “Labor” argument won that cam-
paign by a short head. It is well known
that many trade-unionists voted “Yes”
with Mr. Menzies, just as they had voted
for him and his anti-Communist policy
at two successive general elections. Which
was natural enough, seeing that A.L.P.
industrial groups were already carrying
on their own anti-Commo battle, with
the superficial approval but underlying
anxiety of the “Labor”-party manage-
ment. Aware of that, Dr. Evatt ordered
that there should be no “witch-hunting.”
The referendum campaign being over,
official “Labor” in S.A. promptly turned
on the industrial groups and banned them.
Their charge against Mr. Chambers
could get him expelled from the party.
Fhat is what the S.A. branch under new
Leftist control thinks of anything opposed
to Communism in “the movement.” At
the previous session, which drummed out
the anti-Commo groups, Mr. Kennedy, of
Victoria, A.L.P. Federal secretary, was
present. His approving comment, in a
pontifical address, was on the lines that
“there was no place in the party for those
on the extreme Left and the extreme
Right.” That would seem to cook Mr.
Clyde Cameron’s goose, too, except that
his opponents say Mr. Cameron, by
virtue of the arrangement for voting on
the card system, “has complete control of
the executive”—has all the cards up his
sleeve.
This is only a symptom of “Labor’s”
own increasing division on this Commo
issue, and Dr. Evatt had better put his
big foot down, if he can. That union
groups will not take the Adelaide ban
lying down is clear from the eagerness
with which some of them are seizing the
chance offered by the Menzies legislation
to get the Arbitration Court’s impartial
aid in conducting ballots for their
elections. The disclosures that the execu-
tive of the Clerks’ Union has decided to
alter the union rules so as to defeat a
“clean” ballot by postponing a new
election of officers for six years is a sign
of how the Commos are working to extend
their hold.
Lost Souls.
The limitations of the Federal Consti-
tution arc again illustrated by the anoma-
lous position of the three able young
“Parliamentary secretaries” in the Federal
House Messrs. Howse, Hamilton
and Falkinder —who were appointed in
1950 to assist Ministers and presumably
to acquire experience which would
qualify them for full Ministerial rank.
It was intended that their status and
duties should be modelled on those of
Parliamentary secretaries and under-
secretaries in the British Parliament.
These answer questions, sometimes take
charge of bills brought down by their
departments and are recognised by Par-
liament as deputies of Ministers.
In Canberra it is perforce otherwise.
Messrs. Howse, Hamilton and Falkinder
cannot perform any duties in the House
because there is neither provision for
their offices in the Constitution, which
recognises only Ministers of State, nor
power within the Constitution to enable
Parliament to recognise them. Since it
is essential as part of the practice of
responsible Ministerial government that
a legally-appointed Minister should be at
all times in charge of the business of the
House, they cannot act as deputy-
Mmisters, since they would have no
official status as such.
Even if they undertake routine duties
outside the House they cannot be
specially paid for them, for if they take
a penny in addition to their Parliamentary
salaries they risk losing their seats.
Section 44 of the Constitution expressly
provides:
Any person who holds any office of
profit under the Crown shall be In-
capable of being' chosen or sitting as a
Senator or member of the House of Rep-
resentatives.
And a proviso to the section which
expressly excludes Ministers of State and
members of the defence forces on pension
or half-pay or not wholly employed by
the Commonwealth from its effects shows
how rigidly the rule is intended to be
enforced.
Much as Parliamentary secretaries are
needed, and useful as their appointment
on the basis operating in Westminster
would be, their titles now are empty and
their status that of lost souls whose offices
are not even acknowledged to exist in
the official lists of “Hansard” —their
names and offices appearing in 1950 under
those of the Ministry, but not now. Their
case provides one more argument for
the holding of a Constitutional convention
to take steps to free Parliament from
some of the shackles which prevent it
from being sovereign even in the exercise
of its own internal domestic affairs.
Sparrows and Officials.
Being a very sane people ourselves, we
can’t help laughing over the story from
Communist-run East Germany about the
sparrows and the police ordered out to
arrest them and shoot any which resist.
Some official or other there noted the
sparrows’ penchant for eating grain, be-
gan an investigation, discovered that one
sparrow was capable of eating 51b. to
91b. of grain in a single year, related this
to the estimated number of sparrows in
East Germany, the population, the ex-
pected harvest and sundry other items.
As a result, sparrows are convicted of
eating grain which “should go to the
workers,” and are therefore “enemies of
the people” and “saboteurs.”
Somebody has advised people outside
the Iron Curtain that if sparrows hence-
forth come tapping at the window they
should be let in, because they are now
political refugees. In East Germany the
police have been issued with ammunition
and ordered to shoot 10 sparrows for
every 2\ acres of cultivated land, a quota
set by the officials handling the matter.
Yes, it’s funny—until one realises that
if we don’t look out officials will be doing
similar things here. In East Germany, as
in Russia and her satellites, the bureau-
crat is a godlike figure with an almost
free hand. Some of our own bureaucrats
and Governments seem to think they have
a free hand, too. In Queensland they’re
invading potato-farms with the intention
of seizing the farmer’s property; in
N.S.W. the Premier has said that if some
people won’t produce butter he’ll put in
men who will.
Almost everybody who has had deal-
ing with Government departments has
come across orders and statements and
conclusions and decisions even more
silly than the one about the sparrows—-
which is perhaps not as silly as it looks
in a community on short rations —but
they are nothing to what ordinary people
will have to put up with if controls
extend and Australians finally surrender
their enterprise and independence to
Government officials.
Strikes—By Glory.
The report:
“Glory today carried out 60 sorties. Targets
railways, tunnels, bridges and close-support of
advancing U.M infantry. Two aircraft were
lost.”
The background;
With the after part of her flight-deck crowded
with bombed-up Fireflies, the catapult port side
forrard is used. Lt.-Commander Alan Swanton,
squadron-commander of the Firefly squadron
(he helped torpedo Bismarck with a flight of
Swordfish), presses his head back against his
headrest —hard. The next second a whoosh,
an almighty punch in his back, and his Firefly
hurtles off the catapult, dips, then claws sky-
ward. The squadron follows, menacing bats
shot off every few minutes.
One dips, fails to rise, and sprays into the
sea. Those airborne, looking down, can see
the helmeted figure struggling from the cockpit.
The pilot, looking up, can sec a knife of steel,
topped by a spreading roof, flanked by twin

white bow-waves. The stem strikes, carves his
plane in two, A second later, swept aside by
the bow-wave, he leels something slapping his
iace on the end of a steel wire, ihe helicopter.
He fastens the belt, the electric winch in the
hovering whirligig heaves in, the plane lifts.
Drops him on the highl-deck —time, three
minutes.
Formed up, the squadron heads for the suc-
cessive line of ridges, like black solidified waves
rising from the sea to starb’d. Quickly the
railway-line is picked up, a tenuous thread lean-
ing them to the target —a black hole in a hill-
side into which the line runs, to appear the
other side. Safety-catches hick oh bomb-release
buttons on control-columns; a quiet order from
a mouth-matching microphone; sieek noses and
heavy bellies tilt downwards; tne snarling whine
of diving aircraft; and, in switt succession,
black blobs detaching from oil-streaked bellies
and hurtling groundwards. Aimed shallowly,
so that they will skip inside. A streak of blacK
disappears into the waiting mouth; a roar; a
gout of black smoke vomits from the tunnel’s
other end. Then a string of blasts, giant drum-
ming roars. An ulcerated mound of rubble
where the neatly-rounded tunnel-mouth had
stood.
Off further inland. A lone and spunky little
Auster spotting-aircraft is sighted, a silver motn
against the green below, bwanton’s earphones
crackle. “See that ridge otf my starb’d wing/
The pine-trees this side, under the rim? Five
hundred troops in the trees.” The Fireflies
roar in, laying the rest of their eggs at the base
of black, spouting pillars. On target, but not
so good, A more embracing touch is required.
Three strangers approach, with peculiar gull-
wings and a white-painted name along tne
fuselage—U.S. Marine Corsairs. The Ausler
contacts them, mentions the ridge. Ihe Corsairs
answer by kicking over on one wing. They
straighten out, low, colorless streaks. Three
pointed cylinders drop—and, striking, erupt in
vast, roaring sweeps of flame. Napalm. The
frightful sturf pours its molten deaui into fox-
holes, trenches, makes of the pine-trees a flaming
death trap. Enough heat in it to fuse the gun-
turrets of tanks. The watching Fireflies bank
respectfully and draw off.
Back to the ship, job well done. Only the
deck-landing now. Then a line of tracer stitches
up in a beautiful, graceful arc. The lights wink
out as they bite into the left-hand plane of the
flight. Smoke. Growing, streaming into a vast
plume. They circle and watch him hit, bounce
and slither on one wing into a clump of bushes.
A figure stumbles from the bushes. An order
sweeps through the ether to the helicopter; no
order is needed for the next action. As little
flickers of light stab from the surrounding trees
and cut furrows round the pilot, the Fireflies
fall headlong out of the sky on to those flickers,
brown balls of smoke breaking from their wings.
The flickers flicker out. The planes roar tor
height. An unwieldy windmill approaches,
hovers 'over the burning wreckage. The belt
comes out, drops swiftly earthward on its wire.
And the flickers of flame come to life again
from the trees. The Fireflies, watching, go
berserk. Pilot and helicopter are isolated by
an erupting circular chain of 20mm. cannon-
shells. The flickers persist a moment, then are
quenched under the blanket of bursting h.e.
A bulky figure swings on the end of an invisible
wire, closer to the helicopter. He is bundled
in through the wide door. The Fireflies orbit
in a fast, ready circle round the whirligig, which
clambers off at a steady 60 knots for the ship.
Arrester-wires catch, stretch and jerk each
aircraft to a spine-jolting stop. The mechanics,
armorers, fuelling-hands are waiting. As is the
de-briefing officer, for his pilots’ reports.
POLITICAL POINTS
For the first time since the war Japanese
whaling fleets now on their way south
are not carrying Allied inspection officers.
The Nips are on their honor to observe

When the bill to repeal the Wool
Sales Deduction Act was introduced into
the Reps, last Thursday it was expected
that its passage would be a mere for-
mality, but a number of Opposition
members took the opportunity to leap to
their feet to attack the original Act,
although that measure would never have
become law had “Labor” Senators voted
against it—they had the numbers to stop
it. “Labor” speakers made impassioned
references to the iniquity of the Fadden
bill, but “Labor’s” plan for the wool-
growers—one or two of the rank-and-
file carelessly let the cat out of the bag—
was a home-consumption price for wool.
Calwell, in the unaccustomed role of
friend of the graziers, told the House —
and more particularly the listening
public—that the Government was repeal-
ing the Act because it had lost seats at
the last election. He claimed that his
colleagues McLeod (Wannon) and Fuller
(Hume) were back in the House “because
of this measure.” It may be true that
the few votes necessary to switch Wannon
and Hume from Government to “Labor”
allegiance did belong to disgruntled and
misinformed woolmen, but McLeod and
Fuller are scarcely flattered by their
deputy-leader’s remark.
In the 1930’s a common jibe was
“Join the U.A.P. and see the world,” and
a decade later the overseas jaunts of
“Labor” Ministers and members made
the tourists of the Joe Lyons generation
look like weekend trippers. Nowadays,
it is the Communists who seem to have
the secret of how to get a deadhead’s
trip to Europe. Most of the top-rank
Reds have had at least one trip since
1947; many of them more than one.
Comrade Elliott, of the Seamen’s Union,
for example, has just gone off again— to
attend the annual conference of the
Red W.F.T.U.
Sydney’s No-water Board, after a
silence almost comparable with that of
Dean Maitland, is in action again, its
president announcing that the Big Wen is
running out of water again and will be
short if the summer is hot. It is under-
stood this is not expected to affect the
supply of bottled beer for night-clubs.
Narrowest win in the British general
election was that of Labor man
E. A. Shackleton (son of the Antarctic
explorer), who held Preston North by 16
votes. At the other end of the scale was
H. E. Holmes, another Attlee man, who
won Hemsworth by 37,491. Labor
candidates in 35 constituencies had
majorities of over 20,000, Conservatives
in 11. The close finishes were more
evenly divided—22 Conservatives and 20
Labor members got home by fewer than
a thousand, and one Liberal and the
solitary representative of the Irish Labor
party were in the same bracket. The
new Commons will include 17 women.
There were 21 in the last Parliament and

Fishermen on the N. S. Wales North
Coast have been coming in for a little
publicity lately for having pioneered a
new industry—deep-sea prawning. Enter-
prising chaps as well as energetic, they
have formed a Fishermen’s Co-operative
and have been doing pretty well. Now
there’s cloud on their horizon ; someone
in Macquarie-street has heard of their
success and there’s talk of starting a
Prawn Board,
From Yugoslavia come reports of a
resistance movement among the farmers,
who are objecting to being forced to
deliver all their grain to the State; the
sequel promises to be a falling-olt in pro-
duction, as many farmers seem to be
sowing only sufficient wheat for their own
requirements. Queensland’s Mr. Gair,
who is trying to force potato-growers to
hand over all their produce to the State
Potato Board, should ponder over this
news from Titoland.
When a Queensland Potato Board
inspector proposed to mark some bags
of potatoes on a Darling Downs farm to
show they were board property this
dialogue occurred:
Farmer: You will not mark or touch
them. I grew them and they are my
property. There is the road; 1 give you
tive minutes to get out.
Inspector: Is that a threat?
Farmer: Yes. Now get out!
The inspectors—there were two —got.
Somebody asked Acting-Premier Gair
what he intended to do about it and
received the highly original reply “It is a
matter for the Potato Board.” It is also
a matter for every Australian who thinks
his freedom worth preserving.
The Literary Censorship Board in Can-
berra has lifted a Customs suspension on
the importation of Dal Stivens’s big-
business novel Jimmy Brockett. Thus
Stivens fails to get his novel into the
company of Redheap and Ulysses, banned
by Customs Ministers in pre-board days,
but may console himself with that of
The Golden Asse, which the board also
decided could safely be let loose in Aus-
tralia.
Almost the only movement observable
lately in the housing field in Victoria has
been an announcement by one-time
“Labor” Housing Minister Barry that he
had up his sleeve or somewhere a
“secret” house which would cost £lOOO
and could be used for big-scale housing.
The house, he said, had been built, but
he wouldn’t say where. A frenzied search
for the edifice started, but interest died
when it was eventually found at McKin-
non, The present occupant stated that the
original owner paid £2BOO for it, he paid
£3OOO and anybody could have it for
£5OOO.
Limerick (Ireland) Council found that
it couldn’t build houses on a certain hill
because leprechauns made shoes there at
night. In many parts of Australia the
people can’t build houses because housing
commissions and building - material
controls don’t make anything—except
mountains of files.
When the figures for this year’s coal
production are published the Victorian
Gas and Fuel Corporation will probably
inquire politely, “Is that with or without
stones?” Coal supplied for Melbourne
gasworks recently is described by the
management there as of appalling quality
because of the high proportion of stones
in it. The Coal Board’s reply is that be-
cause of production losses at Maitland
a certain proportion of low-grade coal
must be shipped. The result is that Mel-
bourne is at present having its gas
rationed, as the gasworks experts have
established that you can’t get gas out
of stones, no matter how black they are.
Another example of the lengths to
which Red union bosses will go to
preserve their grip on the reins is
given by resolutions adopted by the
central council of the Clerks’ Union.
This executive extended the term of half
its members to 1955 and provided that
the other half should, in future, hold
office for six years instead of one. In-
dustrial groupers inside the union are
protesting to the Industrial Court. They
also want to know why the union’s ex-
penditure over the last two years has
exceeded members’ contributions by more
than £12,000.
Once again prophecies are being made
of Australia’s future as a cotton-growing
country. A Cotton Bounty Bill now
before the Federal Parliament provides
for a guarantee of 9jd. a pound to growers
for seed cotton, and Defence Production
Minister Harrison, in introducing it, said
the guarantee was being offered on the
understanding that the industry would try
to put itself on a sound and efficient basis.
The Queensland Agricultural Department
is going into the matter of the best types
of plant for machine-harvesting, without
which there isn’t much hope of the
industry becoming self-supporting, let
alone valuable. The guarantee is being
paid in the face of Tariff Board dis-
approval.
The Gascoyne seat in. the Westralian
Assembly, vacant through the appoint-
ment of former “Labor” Premier Wise as
Administrator of the Northern Territory,
was won by the unendorsed Liberal-
Country League candidate Noel Albert
Butcher, a R.A.A.F. man who has also
had considerable experience on and
below the ground. Latterly the new mem-
ber has been growing bananas at East
Carnarvon ; in earlier years he worked
in the goldmining industry, both under-
ground and as manager of the Comet at
Marble Bar. His win gives the Mc-
Larty Government a majority of three
after supplying the Speaker, and with-
out the aid of the sole Independent—R.
Read, of Victoria Park.
Victorian egg matters seem to get more
addled every day. A select committee
attacked board member Hurst, who is
demanding a royal commission on the
select committee, which has recom-
mended a new board at higher pay for
a longer term. Whatever egg-eaters
expected out of it, about all they’re likely
to get is a smell. It was a great chance
to abolish the board for a while to see
how things would work out on the old
law of supply and demand, but Vic-
torians have lost the chance.
Sydney draper Mark Foy, who left a
will providing that his remains should be
interred in a sort of Taj Mahal in the
Blue Mountains, will have to be satis-
fied with an ordinary grave in a suburban
cemetery. His legatees told the N.S.W.
Equity Court that the thing would cost
over £32,000 to build and yearly sums
for upkeep. When bequests and death
duties had done with the estate only
£16,938 was left, and there were four to
share that. The court absolved the
legatees of doing the job.
Pakistan’s Foreign Minister has offered
his country’s services as mediator in the
Suez Canal dispute. The offer is doubt-
less well-intentioned, but the remarks
that accompanied it robbed it of any
chance of being accepted. Sir Zafrullah
Khan said “Which is worth more, the
letter of the treaty or the friendship and
co-operation of Egypt?” This implies
that the Minister envisages only one out-
come of the “mediation” —a British
backdown.
A boost for private enterprise came
from an unexpected source last week
when unendorsed “Labor” man
Geraghty, criticising the increased fares
on N. S. Wales trams and buses, said that
private enterprise would make a huge
success of the State transport system, and
that “if the Transport Department were
placed on a sound, solid basis, it should
be one of the most successful and most
profitable undertakings run by the Gov-
ernment.” The last part of his statement
is not as impressive as it sounds. “One
of the most successful?” What are the
other successful undertakings?
Chairman of Committees Adermann
drew the attention of the House to the
fact that 100 members had said their

tunately, is available to show how many

about or how many really meant what
they said.

“B. A. Ker”: I fear I have become a
callous cad where the sufferings of
Hollywood’s great are concerned. When
Trudy Garbage makes a half-hearted
attempt to cut her throat the only sympa-
thetic remark I can think of is “Better
luck next time.” And if Francho Phoney
chooses to get himself bashed up by a
young bloke half his age, over a girl of
similar vintage, my browned-off suscepti-
bilities merely shrug their shoulders and
mutter “Well, that’s his funeral —or
rather, ambulance.” But I felt a genuine
pang of regret at the news that Australian-
born comedian, Leon Errol, had died in
Hollywood. That was about two years
ago. Last week I had to go through it
all again. There can be no doubt about
it —the same Sydney newspapers published
a few details of his career, just as they
did on the occasion of his first demise.
It is to be hoped that this reincarnation
business doesn’t catch on the way divorce
did, or, as a variation from the usual
Hollywood blurb: “Before her recent
Reno divorce Gloria Glamorpuss was

“Bo”: In all the years I have been a
backyard spudgrower 1 have hearkened
to the advice of the pundits. Constantly
they have adjured me to be extremely
careful that I use only “certified” seed,
and then only that in the most robust
condition. They implored me to put ’em
under wet bags for set periods to induce
eyes to shoot and get them to the neces-
sary “green” state, and they peddled a
lot more exhortation, failing which I’d
be doomed to go tuberless. Well, this
season the blackmarketeers snapped up
all the commercial seed potatoes that
came to Sydney, selling them for the table
at fancy prices. Then I remembered
having cast into a corner last year’s
“marbles.” I located them after a search ;
they were debilitated, dehydrated, emaci-
ated, with more wrinkles than a centen-
arian, and of that peculiar green seen on
old bowler hats and dug-up pennies. I
slammed them in and hoped for the best.
Within a fortnight they had burst from
their earthy bonds, fighting-mad and
full of rude health. Apparently deter-
mined to make the theorists look goats,
they are now producing tubers of a most
promising obesity, as a judicious spot of
“bandicooting” has disclosed. Had I
taken the advice of the experts I would
now be looking forward to being soaked
by the blackmarketeers for other “hard”
vegetables like pumpkin, carrots and
swedes at prices 15 times their pre-war
price. Anyone want to buy a gardening
book?

“Undoubting Thomas”: I wish I had
not been so difficult to convert to my
present firm belief in telepathy (B.
17/10/’5l). Awakening to a strong
stench of smoke in my nostrils in my
top-floor room of a ramshackle pub in
western Queensland, I yelled the alarm
whilst I made with the bedcover a swag
of my very few goods and chattels and
hurled it over the balcony, before making
for the stairs in the hope that I could
escape that way. The publican and other
occupants took my alarm as a poor joke
when no fire could be discovered. 1
had to admit to a nightmare even while
the stench of smoke still lined my nasal
passages. Three nights later I awoke
with an identical sensation, but this time
lay quietly until it was too late to save
my gear or sound the alarm in time to
allow the other guests to salvage theirs
from the flames which enveloped the
wooden pub. I forestall suggestions that
I am a somnambulistic pyromaniac by
pointing out that the fire which razed the
pub was traced to a short-circuit in the
wiring of an adjoining shop.

small Boy Scout who yearned to enroll

With a mercy in com-

Ray Whiting: When a Bulletin draw-
ing of mine showed a Digger on parade
with an umbrella, “Ek Dum” remarked
that the joke wouldn’t have raised a
laugh in Wellington’s day, when gamps
were considered a normal campaigning
accessory. This may be correct; but,
apparently, trotting out your brolly when
the enemy was looking was another of
those things which didn’t do for the Duke,
At any rate, a Captain Gronow, whose
recollections were quoted in a recent
“Lilliput,” wrote: —
In 1813, in the neighborhood of Bayonne,
the Grenadier Guards occupied an un-
finished redoubt. When the Duke of
Wellington happened to pass he saw, to
his surprise, a great many umbrellas, with
f§YS
“Any key-money?"
which the officers protected themselves from
the falling rain. His aide-de-camp came
galloping up to us saying “Lord Wellington
does not approve of the use of umbrellas
during the enemy’s firing, and will not
allow gentlemen’s sons to make themselves
ridiculous in the eyes of the army.” The
Colonel a few days afterwards received a
wigging from Lord Wellington for suffering
his officers to carry umbrellas in the face
of the enemy.
Still, I doubt if the Duke’s wigging could
have been as withering as Monty’s on the
base-walloping brasshats in Cairo.
Whew!

“Spokeshave”: Many reasons have
been advanced to explain the slow turn-
round of ships in Australian ports, but
the aesthetic feeling that stirs deep down
in the breast of every wharfie accounted
for one case in Melbourne. A well-
known artist had set his easel up in a
position that gave him a view of a long
vista of ships unloading. A wharfie
observing him stepped up and contem-
plated the canvas. “How long will it
take you to finish that, mister?” he asked.
“Oh, about threequarters of an hour,”
replied the artist. “Hi, mates,” shouted
the wharfie, “Keep ’er going for another
half-hour and don’t let that other boat
get in. This bloke hasn’t finished his
picture.”

“Nobby II”: I am ashamed of “Mac-
nell” (B. 31/10/’5l), who otherwise seems
to smell of salt, when he protests against
the naval usage of the word “wear” in
relation to a flag and “in” in relation
to a ship. A ship is a lady, and if she
cannot wear even a flag, where are we?
Apart from this, “wear” has been the
correct word right back to Elizabethan
days, and the Oxford Dictionary gives it
as meaning “to fly” when applied to the
flag of either a ship or a commander.
Also, if “Macn.” ever decides to do any
spying in the R.N. let him beware how he
speaks of being “on a ship” instead of
“in” one, for a spy who followed his
preference in a pub in naval company in
World War I met disaster through it.
'‘Macn.,” Nelson, “Bartimeus” and all the
McCrimmons notwithstanding, “in” has
the most hallowed support, apart from be-
ing accepted as the right word for over
400 ye T >rs, for at the very christening of
every Naval ship that sails the oceans
the 107th Psalm is intoned with
due effect upon the emotions of
sailormea: “They that go down to the
sea in ships, that do business in great
waters” And if that is not enough,
here’s the testimony of a seasick land-
lubber. Dr. Johnson (as quoted by Bos-
well) : “Beipg in a ship is being in a jail,

“Ex-C.G.”: I can tell “Bo” (B.
31/10/’5l) of one riot that wasn’t
“quelled” and which didn’t happen in
Cairo or Shantung but in staid Melbourne.
It was at this time of year in 1923. The
police had gone on strike and refused
duty, and on Derby Night a mighty crowd
suddenly let itself go, smashing and loot-
ing and burning and fighting throughout
the heart of the city. It began between
6 p.m. and 7 p.m. and went on for a
couple of hours or more —until the rioters
simply got tired and sat down where they
were or drifted home. By the time a
mixed force of ex-Light Horsemen,
R.A.N. squads, volunteers and super-
annuated police began restoring order
only the more enduring of the rioters were
still performing, with a few reinforce-
ments from the suburbs comprising largely
elements full of rage because they hadn't
been in when the first looting began.
There were fresh outbreaks on the Sun-
day, but pretty well everybody was dog-
tired by then and peace descended on the
wrecked city of its own volition. In
the hectic 48 hours there wasn’t a law
body capable of “quelling” a dog-fight.

“Merv”: “Macann’s” early-morning
tram-travellers (B. 3/10/’5l) may not
have been as indifferent as he imagined
towards the limbless Digger. One learns
a fair bit about human nature after a
few months in hospitals, and 12 months’
experience on crutches taught me a few
points. We had a sort of unwritten law
that “you don’t help chaps on crutches.”
You gave them plenty of room and
quietly made ready to save possible falls
in boarding vehicles, but you did not
offer assistance. Crutches can be used
safely only by the chap wearing them;
other well-meaning helpers are almost
always a hindrance. I found the greatest
menace was the tram-conductor who
pulled the cord before I had time to find
a seat. It would probably surprise even
the conductors themselves to learn how
many of their number are thoughtless
in this respect.
POOR LITTLE RICH GIRL.
“If you are sitting on top of wool, you arc silting
on top of the world.’’ —Sir Douglas Copland.
On top of the world with her knitting,
A woolsack to serve as her throne.
A beautiful maiden was sitting,
Except for Sir Douglas, alone.
“You’ve risen to these heights on wool,”
Said Sir Doug as she plained and she purled;
But the girl said, “It’s terribly cool
Up here on the top of the world.
“Though I knit for my living all day
My wardrobe is far from complete,
And whatever I offer to pay,
I can’t get enough food to eat;
Though I hoped for a cottage at Pymble,
My flag of ambition is furled —
I'm just a prosperity-symbol
Up here on the top of the world.”
Sir Douglas replied, “All this mouthing
Obscures the position as is;
Some people have food, some have clothing,
And others have houses, young Miss:
Consider yourself spun in toto
As fibres are twisted and twirled,
And there won’t be a place you can’t go to
From here on the top of the world.”
But the girl said, “Sir Douglas, your teaching
Is merely a lot of hot air;
Wherever I’m thinking of reaching,
It won’t be for Sheehan’s new fare.
Ah me, that the poor little rich girl,
So complex, controlled, combed and curled,
Might become a plain down-in-the-ditch-girl
And get off the top of the world!”

“Chevroford”: One of these days the
Melbourne Cup may be displaced in
public interest by the Australian Soapbox
Derby, the champion ribbon for which
was fought for last week. Locale was
Bastings-street hill, Northcote, which
gives a clear run of 420 yards of smooth
road between suburban houses. Vehicles
entered these days are called soapboxes
by courtesy only. They have stream-
lined aluminium bodies, roller bearings
and wheels which cost £2O each, total cost
round about £lOO. They are sometimes
tested in a wind tunnel for streamlining.
Contestants come from all States and
speeds of 45 m.p.h. are reached. And
this year’s championship was won by a
girl!
* * * *
“Taswegian”: After a road smash in
Tasmania last month the first car to come
along was stopped; five men got out,
summed up the situation, got a box
from their car, and in a few minutes had
everything under control; the worst-hurt
bandaged and comfortable, ready for the
ambulance that arrived soon afterwards;
the others treated for minor injuries and
shock. The five men were the members
of the Hobart railway first-aid team,
driving to Launceston from Burnie after
winning the Gregory Sprott shield for
first-aid. A few days later they won the
State railway contest for the fourth suc-
cessive year, and the right to represent
the Speck in Adelaide against other State
railway teams. I’ll wager they got more
satisfaction from the job they did in
the real accident than from their victories
in the makebelieve ones.
“Ike Hollar”: While “D.L.A.” was on
the subject of tea supplies (B. 24/10/’5l)
he might have mentioned the riots that
followed the introduction of green tea
nearly half a century after the shortage
he recalled. Green tea used to be prized
in Europe as a sleep-banner, helping the
studious to keep Morpheus at bay ; but
it was not as a sleep-resister that it be-
came famous in N.S.W. A merchant
found large stocks available at a cheaper
price and he sold his consignments in
case lots to station-owners. It happened
to be the time when the Shearers’ Union
was arriving and the war between station-
owners and hands was growing bitter;
and the hands reckoned the green tea
was a shot in the war. It was poisonous,
ran the furphy; the ruthless bosses,
having decided that if they got rid of the
rebels they would replace them with cheap
Chinese labor or something, had decided
upon a wholesale killing-off. The green
tea was refused, and black demanded;
there were strikes and, in some cases,
serious riots. For a long time aftei-
wards, while black tea was the handout
to the employees, station families used
the green tea themselves to save a dead
loss.
* * * *
“Sixenate”: Another of those curious
excuses came to light in a Sydney court
“I'd like you to meet Mother."
when an offender was charged with using
indecent language over the telephone. A
policeman deputed to watch a public
phone-box because of previous com-
plaints nabbed a man just as he was re-
leasing a torrent of language which
shocked the magistrate when it was quoted
to him. He told the defendant that the
speech was filthy, and asked what he
had to say about it. “I was only speak-
ing to the missus,” the defendant pleaded.
* * * *
“Hamer” recalls the first Armistice
Day:
Invalided from France, I had been released
from hospital to look after the Horseferry-road
end of what was known as the “Billy Hughes-
street”—it redressed grievances of Diggers and
made Billy popular—and had established myself
so well with the London papers that life was
comfortable and my Army pay was small
potatoes. On the morning of November 11
there was in my heart a hope that the projected
signing of the Armistice would be postponed
long enough to enable me to collect my week’s
contributions owing from Carmelite House
(“Daily Mail” and “Evening News”); the
3s. 4d, I had in my pocket seemed hopelessly
inadequate for a real celebration. But at 11 a.m.
London burst into joyful noise, bells clamoring
delight and maroons exploding, and everybody
poured into the streets. With a group of Digger
pals who claimed me 1 went into the corner
pub in Scrutton’s Ground, where the publican
knocked-back our money and poured us out
double-header whiskies —the first time I had
known a publican in England to shout. In
Victoria-street we were mobbed by groups of
girls, who decorated our uniforms with badges,
flags and ribbons. From then on the day
became sheer carnival; part of it was spent
with a Tommy colonel, who was full of admira-
tion for “you Australians” and seemed a very
fine fellow —but when I expressed that view of
him some days later to a sergeant of his regi-
ment who had seen us together the sarge said
“He’s a regular blankard to his own men.”
I awoke next morning in my lodgings lying
on my bed, still in my much-decorated uniform;
my landlady’s baby daughter, who sometimes
visited me in the morning, was picking badges
off my tunic and pinning them to her dress.
With a hazy recollection of later doings that
had taken me to various parts of London, 1
wondered how I had managed it on my limited
money, but when I felt in my pocket I dis-
covered that 1 still had 3s. 4d. For weeks later
I was returning the hospitality of people vaguely
familiar, who reminded me of “the great time
we had on Armistice Day,” but I never saw
that colonel again.

“Zake”; Sydney’s antediluvian foot-
board-type trams have long been the
subject of strong but mostly unavailing
protests by well-meaning people who have
been horrified at the number of con-
ductors who have been swept by passing
trucks from their precarious perch and
at the conditions it imposes on them in
vile weather. Yet one curious fact re-
mains. Most of the troubs themselves
prefer swinging along that lOin. strip on
the outside than working in the corridor-
type trams. Their attitude was summed
up succinctly by one of the many I asked.
“In the corridors you’ve got to battle
continually through a crush; you’ve got
your footboard all to yourself.” Which,
after all, has its logic.
* * * *
“Bagot”: Unnecessary swearing (B.
10/10/’51)? I know a teacher of English
and elocution who, in his classroom, is
esteemed for the refined and flawless
phrases he draws from a vast vocabulary.
Yet when he is with his cronies at golf
or over a beer his talk is plastered with
blood-curdling obscenities. As he could
not possibly be described as “insincere.
unreliable and not a good mate,” the
only conclusion is that his swearing is a
form of relaxation from the monotony of
the gems that fall from his lips at his
daily job.
* * * *
“C.D.N.”: “Sackville” (B. 10/10/’5l)
fosters the mistaken idea that sign-
writers cannot spell. No doubt the writer
of the “Bulli Lookuot” sign could spell
“out,” but in giving incessant concentra-
tion to the formation of each letter he
lost sight of the whole word. Sign-
writers often have to correct mistakes in
NO SMOKINg/ALOUD
spelling when
d e c i p h ering
the ungainly
scrawls they
receive as
scripts from
clients. One
customer will
insist on
“Mother’s Day,” another on “Mothers’
Day.” Mr. Soandso will forbid the use
of an apostrophe in advertising “Soandsos
wares.” The signwriter gets the blame.
“I only followed your script,” explained
one of the tribe who had written “The
only one of it’s kind,” to a dissatisfied
customer who bellowed: “If it had blown
out of the flaming window, would you
have followed it?”
* :jc * *
“Mr. O’Roo”: Will someone in the
eastern end of Australia help a group of
Gropers out of a terrible dilemma? On
“Sundry Shows” page (B. 3/10//51)
mention was made of a painting by
Norman Lindsay, titled “Bandits at
Soup.” What the gang in our hospital
ward (who have never seen the paint-
ing) want to know is “What does the
painting depict?” Suggestions to date
range from the obvious one —someone
Ned Kelly-like, with quartpot and spoon
in hand, bush clearing, horses in the
background— to the only lady’s idea of a
roses-round-the-door cottage, complete
with canary-cage on the trellis; her
bandits are a couple of sparrows filching
the odd bit of mash. One of our number
who has travelled beyond the rabbit-
proof fence is inflexible in his view that it
must be a pair of Sydney murky-
marketeers sipping a bowl of short or
long in an Oriental cafe, partly concealed
by an enormous potted palm—the foliage
mentioned in the review. Is there a town
or village named Soup, and if there is,
could some villains be planning an
ambuscade in its vicinity? We threw out,
for a fool, the chap who suggested an
attendant going round a clubhouse oil-
ing the poker-machines.
* * ♦ ♦
“Loulalo”: That elephant in the Ring-
ling circus (B. 17/10/’5l) is hardly old
at 77 compared with Alice, who, accord-
ing to Miss Doris Wirth, managing-
director of the Greatest Show on Earth,
is 103. It is three or four years since
I last took the kids to see Wirth’s, but
Alice was looking pretty spry for her
years, swinging along with her fellow-
performers in the Grand Parade.
* * * *
“Anna Ney”: Eating only when you
feel hungry (B. 17/10/ ’5l) is all very
well for the person living alone, but it
becomes complicated when there is a
family to cook for. I should say that
uniform meal-times began as soon as
there was a settled food-supply. When
the caveman gave up depending on what
he could bring down in the way of wild
horse or reindeer for a meal, and began
instead to keep cattle for killing and to
cultivate a bit of ground, no doubt Mrs
Caveman instituted discipline at the
family board, to the saving of her time
and the benefit of the family health.
THE NON-HOMICIDALS.
“The man whose hobby is chess or stamp-collecting’,
given to brooding for long periods over his game or
his collection, may possibly do violence to his fellow-
men. On the other hand, fishing tends to the culti-
vation of a mellow philosophy. Who ever heard of
an angler doing anybody to death ?”
—Radio lecturer.
He whom you see, shoulders a-hunch
As on some move for long he ponders,
So rapt that he forgets his lunch,
His mien impassive as a condor’s.
And yet, withal, perhaps he boils
With anger that must find expression.
Some spring that suddenly uncoils
Within may loose his self-possession.
His bishop he has lost, perhaps;
Thereafter morbidly he’s brooded
Upon his unexampled lapse.
The board of all his men denuded,
His evil temper flares and flames,
And thereupon he starts a yike that
Sees him survive—alone. No blame’s
Attached to him; chess gets you like that.
And, similarly, you may find
Philatelists, seemingly milder
Than curates of the blushing kind,
Are capable of getting wilder
Than any jungle tiger might,
And harbor thoughts quite homicidal
Should someone spill some ink and blight
A beauteous philatelic idol.
But fishermen, you understand,
Are chaps of quite a different kidney,
Whether they fish by rod or hand
Or hail from Exmouth Gulf or Sydney.
They have these traits to make them kin:
They’re unbloodthirsty and they’re placid.
They’d never kick your gizzard in
Or steep you in a bath of acid.
Someone knocks overboard the beer;
A 5/0 hook, fiercely gyrating,
He catches just behind the ear;
As for a bite he’s calmly waiting
Some philistine drops dynamite
Near by. Despite these trials, the angler
Would ne’er set fellowman alight
Or, doing his block, become a strangler.
Take Bluebeard, Peace and Sweeney Todd,
Whose taste for gore we find abhorrent
And altogether rather odd —
They never wet a line, I’ll warrant.
They would have lived out lives benign,
Eschewing ajl those messy slaughters
Had they but taken different lines
And fished —but not in troubled waters.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Solitude”: It was a still, sunny morn-
ing and Seventyfiver was under the gum
opposite the pub, tacking a slipper on his
hack. A magpie strutted close, watched
the old bloke’s operations a while, uttered
a few disparaging ejaculations, then took
himself to a limb overhead and
began to warble. Seventyfiver worked
steadily on. Presently the side-
door of the
pub slowly
opened, and
the stranger
emerged.
He strolled
across the
road, took
in Seventy-
fiver, and
raised hi s
head to the
tree above.
'The magpie’s warbling rose and fell, he
threw in a couple of long-drawn notes,
and returned again to his arpeggios.
“Glorious, by jove,” exclaimed the
stranger. “Simply glorious.” “Eh?”
Seventyfiver raised an eyebrow inquir-
ingly, then went back to his job. “You’d
never hear carolling like that anywhere
but Australia,” the stranger remarked
again. “It’s worth travelling a long way
to hear that.” Seventyfiver contributed
a vague glance, and the maggie a fresh
burst of gargling. “So rippling,” babbled
the stranger. “That bird must rank
among the world’s foremost warblers.”
“Whatchasay?” Seventyfiver paused
again, glanced at the maggie and reached
for a chip. “Aw, stop y’r blasted
squarkin’, y’ noisy cow,” he growled,
taking a potshot at the bird. “Man can’t
’ear a bloomin’ word that’s said!”
* * * *
“Kesem”: The Burdekin plum (Pleiogy-
nium solandri ), which, according to
Rachel Henning (B. 17/10/’5l) grew as
far up as ExmoOr, not far from the
headwaters of the Bowen River, was the
“Don't you know it's rude to point?"
only fruit known to the children of the
miners, carriers, stationhands and trappers
on Burdekin waters even up to the early
years of this century. Trees which grew
on creek-banks were heavy croppers,
having a succulent well-fleshed purple
drupe; the trees which had struggled up
through stony outcrops in badly-watered
areas bore a small almost fleshless plum,
which, however, were never despised by
fruit-hungry children. The richly-colored
leaf is soft in texture, unlike most other
trees of those parts; the dense growth
gives a beautiful shade. Rarely does it
grow to any height, and the fruit of most
trees were readily accessible to adventur-
ous youngsters, who gathered the fruit
mostly with the aid of hurled waddies—
there were always too many ants on the
tree for comfort in climbing.
* * * ♦
“Edx” reports a strange occurrence:
Old George was camped out from Cue
(W.A.), and had the beginnings of a shaft in
the dry bed of a creek, whose sides at this point
were fairly deep and almost vertical. Every
morning at dawn George would climb down
into the creek, and at dark he’d clamber up
again to his bough-hut on the north bank.
One day, when it seemed to be getting dark
earlier than usual and the colors that had
drawn him into the creek seemed to have
petered out altogether, George decided to try
his luck elsewhere, and before packing his gear
thought he’d explore the south bank. He
crossed the creek and began to climb up the
side. Soon he found himself on a ledge several
feet wide, from which the bank continued sheer
to a great height. He thought at the time it
was funny he’d never noticed before that this
bank was so much higher than the other, but
put it down to the fact that he’d never really
looked at the south bank in the daylight. He
drove his pick into the wall, found it fairly
easy going, and was astonished to discover
considerable color in the hungry-looking stuff.
It got quite dark soon after that, and he
recrossed the creek, hardly able to wait for the
next morning. As soon as it was light he was
back on the ledge, tunnelling into the wall as
hard as he could go, The ground proved to
be very loose, and George was obliged to
timber all the way, but at the end of three
days he had made considerable progress, and
was still in good values. He had been slightly
perplexed on the second day when he had
uncovered a tree, apparently in a perfect state
of preservation, and more than startled the next
day to meet a couple of sheep coming out of
the tunnel as he went in. He thought they must
have wandered in during the night, but couldn’t
make out how they could have got up on to
the ledge. On the morning of the fourth day
George climbed up to the ledge as usual, only
to find, to his stupefaction, his tunnel had
disappeared. He nearly fell back into the
creek. The entire wall had disappeared; the
ledge was not a ledge at all, it was, in fact,
the edge of the surrounding country, which now
he could see as far as the horizon. Starting
at his feet, a neat row of collapsed timbering
led a short distance into the bush, the only
evidence of his labors. He was later found
wandering around by a party of prospectors,
who took him into Nannine, where he slowly
recovered from the cruel trick that Nature had
played him. Pefhaps he could be excused,
though—George had never before struck a Cue
dust-storm.
* * * ♦
“Gravelsnatcher”: Recently a cow
belonging to a Westralian dairyfarmer
produced two calves, neither of which
was premature, within five months of
each other. The explanation is that the
cow was served by a bull, but appeared
not to be in calf, and was later served
by another bull. She conceived both
times. This isn’t a common occurrence,
but it does happen. Some years ago on
a Murchison station a mare was served
by a stallion, and, a couple of months
later, by a jack donkey. She foaled to
both. On the same sVation a ewe which
had been covered by a stud ram was seen,
a few days later, running with a ram
which had a small black apot on its belly.
That ewe produced two lambs within
three days of each other, and the second
had an identical belly-marking.
“Blime”; “The Bunyip’s” bloke getting
himself into a mess with a hen-egg (B.
10/10/’5l) had nothing on Aunt Kathie’s
experience. On a trip into the bush she
had come into possession of a large emu-
egg, delightedly transported it home and
set it up on the mantelshelf in the parlor.
For months visitors admired the speci-
men and listened to Aunt Kathie’s story
of its finding. Then came the great day
the honored member for A.K.’s elec-
torate called with his missus. It was hot
and stuffy, the parlor shone with polish,
and over the best china and afternoon-
tea linen the politician was just getting
into his vocal stride. There was a sud-
den explosion. The visitors rose, stared,
then groped madly for the door as they
wiped bits of over-ripe emu-egg off
them.
* * * *
“Kelms”: Genes and chromosomes
(B. 3/10/’51)? Nature must be mighty
puzzled at the way they’re reacting now
to an application of the drug colchicine.
There’s nothing new about this drug—it
was known 2000 years ago, and half a
century ago it was toted all over
America as a universal panacea ; but it
opened up a new field of research when
“ They're rehearsing for the next corroboree ."
two scientists soaked some seeds in it
and sowed them. The resultant plants
grew to twice their normal size, and it
was found that in them each cell con-
tained twice the normal number of
chromosomes. Plants grow by cell-
division —a process in which the chromo-
somes in each cell divide in two, sort
themselves out on each side of the cell
and sit pat while a wall forms between
the two teams, making two cells out of
one. Colchicine apparently acts as an
anesthetic —it halts the process at the
point where the wall should form. So
each cell has twice the normal number
of chromosomes, and the plant grows
twice as big as usual. But that’s not half
the story. Agriculturists have found a
number of uses for the drug, one of the
most important being the treating of
sterile hybrids. By doubling their chromo-
somes colchicine restores the fertility
which was lost in the crossing of the two
species. Soon it will be possible to cross
hitherto uncrossable species, including
varieties of fruits. Now I’m wondering.
Has nature been ignorant all these years
of the effects of colchicine on plant-life,
or has she wisely refrained from using
it? And is she now gnashing her teeth
at man’s discovery, or is she smiling sadly
as man unleashes a force which he will
be unable to control and which may
eventually enable plants to drive him off
the earth?
* * * *
“Kros”: Recently “Gravelsnatcher”
sternly rebuked me for holding that the
weather, abundance of feed and similar
factors affected the breeding of animals
(lemmings was the actual case in point).
Now he declares (B. 24/10/’5l) that he,
too, believes that rains, temperatures,
rich food and the brightness or dullness
of the day (and other things) may all
influence breeding. True, as “G.” says,
science hasn’t as yet definitely proved
this, but there is enough evidence to
warrant our believing it. Still, I wouldn’t
say these outside influences necessarily
affect breeding through the pituitary.
They may; but there is still a great deal
to be learned of the functions of the
glands. The effect may not be through
the glands at all. Many pseudo-scientists
are inclined to try to give a chemical
explanation for every act, emotion and
feeling—of humans as well as of animals.
But psychological reactions also play an
important part in life, even with birds
and animals—or so it seems. The reason
why “G.’s” love-birds did not mate may
have been psychological (nothing to do
with the pituitary gland at all). The
case is similar to many reported instances
of wild creatures which refused to breed
when forcibly kept in captivity.
♦ * * *
“Betcha”: This Gippsland district
produces its quota of shearers, and many
a local kid I’ve given a stand in my small
shed and helped through the learning
stage. I’ve made ’em keep down, use care
with the animals and urged speed only
after the job could be handled properly.
The learning over, they mostly travelled
the big sheds through Queensland and
N.S.W., returning south to pick up local
flocks when the others were finished.
They gained experience, but many times
I’ve looked at their work and wondered.
Then the other day young Jimmy
returned, grabbed a machine and started
in. With his first half-dozen out I paused
at his chute and looked them over—they
were cut, skinned, ridged and decorated
with tufts. “Where did you learn to
shear like that, kid?” Jimmy caught my
eye, glanced out at his shornies and
straightened slowly. “Yair, y’re right,”
he apologised. “Reckon it’s grown into
a habit. But you know how I shore
when I left here?” I nodded. “Clean,
few second-cuts or nicked sheep and a
hundred and twenty a day.” “Yes, but
that way’s no good in the big sheds,” he
explained. “The mob were on to me
right away. Said if I didn’t cut it out and
rough ’em a bit they’d refuse to shear
with me. You see, it makes it bad for
the rest of the team that’s only after a
tally and twelve to fourteen quid a day ”
OUTSIDE THE POLLING-BOOTH.
At the end of the street the mountains, dark,
blue-purple,
Fill the sky, dwarf the marble soldier, stiff and
white,
Cold now the sun-gilt has left him, to patch
with glory
Tom clouds and trailing showers far up the
height.
The wind that scurries the papers along the
gutter—
Vote One No-hoper, the Senate on the back —
Is winter-edged, and we of the better party
Who stand this side of the gate, and they who
lack
Our judgment, and keep to the other, are
suddenly tired;
No longer watchful, we have lost heart for our
game
Of first-to-pounce-on-the-voter—who now is
elsewhere,
Warm at his tea, most likely—wish we were
the same.
Even the dogs have gone home. No one enjoys
An election more than the dogs —small laces
alight
And eager at all the comings and goings, sniffing
Old friends, defying old foes with bark and
skite,
Skirmishing round mixed legs of tables and
humans —
But the last tail sinks below the verge. The fun
Is over, but we must watch by its lingering
deathbed
Till the clock tolls eight on the wind for our
duty done.
Here today the fate of the nation was decided —
Perhaps. But the gap at the gate is shrinking,
is gone
While we the builders and they the destroyers
smile
And remark on the weather. Growing warmer,
we pass on
To our ailments and certain cures. A flurry
of rain
Sweeping in from the sea finds us huddled
together, all
Division forgotten. We know it is not the
thing.
We should have played out our farce till the
curtain-fall
Of decent dark, but more’s to blame than our-
selves ;
More than the voters, who let us all have our
say
With country courtesy, then strolled inside
To vote as they would have voted anyway;
More than our leaders, who have left us only
For pride and faith a creed resigned and terse,
A bitter draught after the froth of fervor:
“They may be s, but the others are worse.”
Yes, more. Time and place, I think, were not
well chosen.
Day’s bright wave ebbs too swiftly, so late in
the year.
Leaving the mountains like cliffs of shipwreck,
huge
And terrible, while still we can see from here
White-glimmering through the dusk the soldier
guarding
Heaped spoils of autumn gardens, withering
away
On the rock at his clumsy feet, the dying
splendor
Washed there by the high tide of Anzac Day,
Fading, the tawny gold and the green laurel,
The velvet crimson, muted under the rain,
And we know whoever wins can no more save us
Than bid the clouds not weep, the light not
wane.
My foe beyond the gate, my countryman
Loves this land as I, and fears for her —even he,
My brother-man on whom the great doom
darkens,
A child of God, who shares under the night
That first, that last, that only hope with me.

“Harbel”: Shakspeare claimed that
there are “sermons in stones.” Don’t
know about that, but there can be history
in a scrap of wood. In a corner of the
shed I came upon a length of sin. x 2in.
about 4ft. long. It was unexpectedly
light; I took another look. Beneath the
dust and cracked paint was the unmistak-
able red of good cedar. Now, where
did I get that? A dozen or more thick
nails and three huge screws spaced along
its length eliminated the timber as a
medium for small cabinet work, but with
a lot of hard work it could have been
ripped down to make a spirit-level.
Evidently, at some time, I had brought
it home for that purpose. Closer
examination spurred memory along ; the
nails were not of this generation—nor the
one before. They were the old-time “cut
nails,” oblong in section and tapered, not
unlike a horseshoe nail. Although rusty
on the outside they were still so solid
they could have been driven into hard-
wood. The screws added to the story;
they had a more pronounced thread than
a modern screw —and no points! That
dated them as before the time of Joey
Chamberlain (Neville’s uncle). Cham-
berlain conceived the idea of putting a
point on the end of the screw, thus
eliminating a lot of boring ; the patent
made a fortune for him. Suddenly my
memory clicked—some 10 years ago I
replaced a window-frame in the oldest
section of Liverpool (N.S.W.) Old Men’s
Home. The piece of cedar had been the
head —and the only unrotted timber in
the old frame. But considering that the
building—originally constructed as a
barracks—had been erected when the
colony was about 30 years old, those old
cut nails had a durability that the modern
wire nail hasn’t got.

“Gravelsnatcher”: Yes, wildflowers
still grow in astonishing profusion in
W.A., and plenty can still be found within
handy distance of Perth (B. 10/10/’5l),
but I can’t agree that they’re as profuse
as they used to be. Does “Bill Ding”
remember the old “flower trains”—the
Sunday excursions that used to run to
some hills station, returning in the even-
ing? Perth station was a pretty sight as
that trainload of passengers disem-
barked, each with an armful of flowers.
Maybe that could be repeated now —
although I doubt it—but the flower which
made up the bulk of those posies would
be missing. It was the everlasting. It
came in all colors, it kept for a month
in vases and it was so popular it was
literally stripped from the ranges. I
doubt if you could get a handful now
within 30 miles of Perth, and to see it in
profusion you’ve got to get up near the
north-eastern corner of the wheatbelt.
W.A. now has pretty stringent regulations
governing the picking of wildflowers —
and they’re needed. A few flowers placed
in vases brighten a home ; strewn around
buildings they may brighten a city—for
an hour or two —but the cost, in wild-life,
is out of all proportion to the result.

“M.S.”: Are there such things as
decent pubs nowadays, or am I just con-
sistently unlucky? I remember the day
when at the old family hotel in the bush
a tired bloke could get not only a feed
and civility at any hour, but also kindly
attention. Even his horse and dog were
cared for. But now! Taking a couple
of horses on a float last week we had a
breakdown miles from anywhere, and,
after calling tails on a head spin, I un-
loaded a nag and rode to the nearest
phone. It meant a mechanic, a day-long
job, no dinner or tea and an arrival late
at night into the next town. Wearily we
made for the pub. When we emerged 10
minutes later I made out a dreary figure
seated on the edge of the veranda look-
ing at the darkness. “Nice sort of pub,
this is,” I growled towards him. “Can’t
get a bed, or a feed, or anything else.”
“No worse’n the one in the next town
where me and me mates are,” came the
voice from the veranda-edge. “There’s
half a dozen of us there in a contract-
shearing gang. Got a couple of months
among the small district sheds, and as
those little places haven’t the facilities we
decided we’d stop at the pub and work
from there. Only the pub wouldn’t hear
of it. Had plenty of room, too. In the
end the boss leased the pub dining-room
and kitchen on condition his twenty-five-
“ Haven't you any romance in you?”
quid-a-week bab. cooks for the pub at the
same time.” “And what are you doing
here?” “Me? Aw, I had to come in
tonight to see the quack,” he explained,
“and here seems as good a place as any-
where else to wait for the mail-bus out
in the morning.”

Frank Jessup : In his interesting flight
of fancy “Binjang” (B. 17/10/’5l)_ makes
the usual mistake about “porpoise-hide
bootlaces.” When the soft layer of
blubber is separated from it a porpoise
hide is very little thicker than tissue-
paper. Actually, the “porpoise-hide”
bootlace, if it is still manufactured, comes
from the hide of a small type of whale
found off Norway. Many years ago,
with the bootlace idea in mind, 1 shot a
porpoise with a rifle in shallow water,
skinned it and as a first step pegged the
skin out in the sun. When the solar
rays had finished with it that hide could
have been used for cigarette-papers. I
have always regretted the demise of that
dolphin in the cause of experimentalism.

“Meri”: Even the cocky in his bucolic
fastnesses is becoming convinced he lives
in a mad world. In our Victorian district
we are being openly advised to leave all
stagnant pools to breed mosquitoes, which
it is hoped will carry the myxo. virus to
spread among the rabbits. Streams and
dams will as a result be full of rotting
carcasses, and we look like having a
major plague of blowflies this summer.
Myself, I stick to the thin film of
smothering oil —I always did prefer
bunny to mossies and blowies.

“Emel”: I found the wild duck’s nests
snuggled between a wiregrass tussock
and a tree-trunk, at least 300 yards from
“ They'll be easier to handle when they've finished with each other."
the nearest water, an irrigation channel,
The duck flashed off quickly from nearly
underfoot. I did not then touch the 11
large lightly-mottled eggs lying among
tiny downy dark feathers, but four days
later I found only one egg in the deserted
nest. I put the egg under a setting hen,
and, when her brood hatched, under
another. This second hen, though she
allowed the only chick she hatched to
die, safely hatched out the duckling 15
days after I brought the egg home. For
a fortnight I kept hen and duckling shut
up. The duckling was very shy, taking
cover when anyone approached their
hutch. Then, as the weather grew hot,
I let them out. The duckling waddled
round after its foster-mother, still taking
cover when extra noise startled it, though
I could get near enough to throw it food.
When the duckling, now semi-detached,
was nearly a month old haycarting so
upset the old hen that she deserted their
hutch. Next morning the duckling was
gone, apparently confident that it could
fend for itself.

“W.M.H.”: South Australian coastal
waters are fast acquiring the reputation
of being the best in the world for big-
shark fishing. So far this year members
of the S.A. Game Fishing Clubs have
established five world records, and they
also hold 10 Australian records. One of
the keenest big-game men in the State is
the Governor, Sir Willoughby Norrie,
who was awarded a gold button in the
Jubilee Game Fishing Carnival. Over-
optimism cost him a higher award —
expecting to catch a much bigger one,
his Ex. cut up a 6001 b. shark for bait.
His biggest catch was made in March,
1950, when he broke the world record
shark catch for a 54-thread line. After
a long struggle with a 22251 b. white-
pointer he had to seek assistance in land-
ing it, which prevented official recogni-
tion of the record.

“Mat’s Mate”: Mat came down to our
camp near Bogan Gate carrying a cornet.
To my feverish queries he confessed that,
having gone into a bazaar in the village,
he’d been cornered by four girls, and only
escaped when he consented to buy four
sixpenny raffle-tickets. “What!” I
howled. “You did our last coupler bob
on raffle-tickets? What’s wrong with y’!
Y’ oughter t’ be” “It was the only
way I could get away from ’em,” he
howled back at me. “What didger want
me t’ do? Bash ’em?” Knowing him
I could sympathise, but the loss of our
last two deeners had me wet. “What’s the
flamin’ cornet for?” I barked. “That’s the
prize,” he moaned. “It could ha’ bin a
five-gallon keg or a bike or a hundred
smokes —but no, it hadda be a flamin
cornet.” He hung the thing on the ridge-
pole and went morosely to his bunk. I
looked at the useless instrument, and rage
mounted until a sort of madness possessed
me. I dragged him from the bunk,
marched him into the hamlet and shoved
the cornet at him. “Play it!” I barked.
“Y’ did our last coupler bob on it, now
play it.” “How can I play the flamin’
thing”—he began. “Never mind. Just
blow,” I ordered. Suddenly he caught
my drift. He put the cornet to his mouth
and blared and barped and honked and
squeaked at Bogan Gate until the police,
the publican, the shire president and most
of the residents threatened to lynch him.
“He won the flamin’ cornet at your
flamin’ bazaar with our last coupler bob,”
I yelled at them, “an’ now y’ won’t let
him play it. What sort of a flamin’ place
is this!” Mat kept on blowing all this
time and only stopped when some public-
spirited citizen coughed up a quid for the
instrument, whereupon we handed it
over and departed for Condobolin and
points west.

“C. Coral”: Torres Straits legend
affords corroborative testimony to the
claim (B. 17/10/’5l) that Polynesians
found their way through the Barrier Reef
to North Queensland shores. Amongst
their hero-cult traditions is the story of
Bomai and Malu, or the “Brethren,”
who, sailing from some part of the Pacific
Islands in great canoes, cast up at Forbes
Island, off the Queensland coast, took a
look at the mainland itself, then sailed up
inside the reef to Boydong Bay, Dugong
Island, and other places in the central
Torres Strait group. There they
separated, Bomai going on to Murray
Island. Maino, Passi and other old hands
amongst the islanders told me that this
was native history as handed down over
the generations. And it is interesting to
note that this is the natural route taken
by floating ocean-current bottles thrown
over from vessels on the Australia-
America run. Natives often handed me
bottle messages (which were duly for-
warded to the respective hydrographic
departments) which they’d picked up on
the beaches in the central group of
islands. The late Dr. Haddon, of Cam-
bridge, who headed a couple of anthropo-
logical expeditions to Torres Strait, traced
the cultural influence of the migration of
the “Brethren,” and also noted that
aboriginal canoes on the east coast near
Cape Bedford have strong affinity with
the Melanesian and Fijian craft, even the
name Wangga being almost identical with
the wanga of the Melanesians, indicating
close contact with Pacific Island voyagers.

“Old-timer”: Little Curl put the paper
down and said “I bin readin’ about these
blokes swimmin’ the English Channel, an’
it started me wonderin’ what become of
Billy Rae. ’Member Billy? He built the
yards down at Tammit an’ was always
skitin’ about how good a swimmer he
was. You was there, Pocketknife, the
night old Kil. come out from Euston an’
come t’ the hut an’ stands there listenin’ t’
Billy skitin’. ’Member?” “Too right,” said
Pocketknife. “Well,” L.C. went on, “old
Kil. chips in an’ reckons Billy is a better
talker than swimmer an’ Billy does his
block an’ they finish up with Kil. bettin’
Billy a quid he can’t swim the Murray in
ten minutes. Out we go inter the night
an’ Billy peels off, an’ when Kil. says
‘Go! ’ he dives in an’ belts inter the water
for all he’s worth. Then we race along
the bank an’ jump inter the pram and the
flattie an’ row like blazes across, keepin’
out o’ Billy’s sight, an’ land ahead of him
an’ gather an’ stand waitin’ for him t'
come in. He thrashes in just above that
mussel bank across from the hut, an’
when he stands up old Kil. says ‘Awa’
with ye, mon, y’ must ha’ got slewed or
did y’ hae t’ tur-rr-rn back?’ Poor old
Billy just gaped at us, wonderin’ how the
blazes he got turned round. Then we had
t’ laugh an he woke up. By cripes, he
was wild. He went for old Kil., but he
had no boots on an’ couldn’t chase him
through the timber. Yair, Kil. paid the
quid. He reckoned it was worth it,
because Billy pulled out next day an’ we
never got another skiter till Squeaker
Watson come an’ ” —but by then every-
body else in the hut was asleep.

“Tiersman”: That 25-year-old galah
owned by Mrs. John Gardner, of Belaii
(SA.), which laid another egg after a
lapse of 24 years (B. 17/10/’5l) followed
up its performance by laying two more
within the next week and is still sitting
on the three. This has been followed by
a cockatoo at Glandore, an Adelaide
suburb, laying its first egg after 17 years,
with another the next day. At Cottoiv
ville, another Adelaide suburb, a whine
crested cockatoo owned by a woman foi
42 years has produced four eggs in aboin
three weeks. Until then cocky had been
regarded as a male. We Croweaten
mightn’t be able to produce a McGirt
or a McDonald, but we have no shortag*

PARK FROM THE HOSPITAL.
This is a vegetable clinic, not a park:
Aseptically shaven grass and sterile paths
Divide with the strict precision of geometry
The wards where huddle beds of arthritic palms
(Condition unchanged) requiring diathermy;
Here in the northern wing are surgical cases,
Moreton Bays, progressing favorably
After the honorary’s skill with ladder and saw.
In the children’s section, lifting small white
Anaemic snowdrops lie, and jaundiced jonquils.
Around them, primly white and blue checkered,
fusses
The pigeon staff, fluttering as the interne comes
On morning rounds past the octagonal house,
The dispensary of well-worn formulas
And brass-band tonics by Verdi and by Strauss.
And had I Prospero’s sea-stained dressing-gown
I’d whistle up from Mittagong the Three
To tunnel and tangle: the wombat, the

And the great roaring gale-drunk stringybark.

Rapid and robust development, which
is not yet complete, accompanied by an
encouraging growth of earning-power,
are the outstanding features of the post-
war history of this big industrial
organisation—it is the largest of its kind
in the Southern Hemisphere. The
parent and eight subsidiaries are an
efficient lot, which together operate some
17 factories scattered throughout the
Commonwealth. And their output covers
a wide range of products, which include
car, heavy-truck and tractor tyres, rub-
ber footwear, flooring and belting, latex
upholstery and mattresses and other in-
dustrial rubber goods, as well as wet-cell
batteries, tennis racquets and gut and
tennis- and golf-balls, etc.
Over the last six years the net growth
in total assets of the group (now
£16,595,267) amounted to no less than
£9,319,355. Shareholders put up
£1,938,347 (including £679,002 of share
premiums), £1,587,500 was raised on
p.c. debentures (which are earning more
than their keep) from the A.M.P. Society,
and £3,566,692 was provided by the bank
and trade creditors. The balance came
from the co.’s large holding of cash, etc.
(£1,222,929 in 1946), and surplus earnings
and provisions.
A lot of new plant came into produc-
tion last term, and the parent’s turnover
shot up by 65 p.c., reaching a record
£18,000,000. About one-third of the
increase was due to bigger output and
the balance to higher selling-prices,
which were bumped up by stiff increases
in the cost of rubber, cotton, rayon and
other raw materials, as well as by steep
lifts in wage-rates and the cost of ser-
vices, etc. The sterling price of rubber,
which accounts for over half the total
cost of most of the goods produced,
leapt from 37.5 d. a pound in August,
1950, to a peak of 68d. in February,
1951, and then receded first sharply and
later by irregular steps to 47d. at the end
of last month. Not all the increase in
costs, however, was passed on in selling-
prices, thanks to the bigger output and to
accumulated stocks of raw materials,
which helped to keep their average cost
well below peak level. Tyre-production,
which still lags behind demand, could be
increased by 25 p.c. if sufficient labor and
an uninterrupted supply of electric
current were available.
After allowing a generous £416,202 (up
£46,132) for depreciation and making
unstated but “adequate” provision for
taxation and other contingencies, net
earnings of the group were £143,044
stronger at £900,162 —£466,286 (up
£195,975) of it was earned by the sub-
sidiaries and £433,876 (down £52,931) by
the parent, whose results appear to be
conservatively stated. After paying
the pref. div. (£93,000), enough remained
to show approximately 18 p.c. on average
ord. capital as against 17.6, 9.6, 11.6 and
11.3 p.c. back to 1947. Continuing its
cautious policy, the board kept the div.
at 8 p.c. Of the £448,045 (49.8 p.c.) of
the year’s profit that remained, £125,000
was sent to the stock revaluation reserve,
making it £300,000, equal to 3.4 p.c. of
the inventory total, which appears at cost
or replacement values, whichever is the
lower. So there is no need for any im-
mediate concern about stocks, the largest
and most vulnerable item in the balance-
sheet.
The growth of the business and
ballooning of prices show up again in the
all-round increase in balance-sheet
figures:

To meet net additions of £3,474,371 to
stocks, £900,443 to book debts, £430,728
to investments (shareholdings) and
£714,950 to fixed assets, £1,304,345 of
fresh share capital, which brought with
it £679,002 of share premiums, was
gathered, the debenture debt was
increased by £337,500, the overdraft by
£1,655,877 (making it £2,600,267) and the
amount coming to trade and other credi-
tors by £679,051 (lifting the figure to

To help finance still further develop-
ment of the undertaking, including the
erection of a new factory at Fremantle
(W.A.), and subject to consent by capital-
issues control, the board proposes
presently to make another new share-

return of only 3.6 p.c. on an 8 p.c. div.
basis. At 445. the 10 p.c. prefs. (£930,000
in a paid capital of £6,000,000) yield 4.5

The decline in prices during the three
months to June 30 last became pro-
nounced at the opening of the current
season, of which more will be said
presently. A new branch at Singleton
(N.S.W.) and the produce, machinery
and real-estate departments helped to
swell the figures, too.
After allowing £18,209 (up £4063) for
depreciation and something for taxation
and other contingencies, declared net
earnings shot up by £72,516, reaching a
record £183,927, or 23.1 p.c. on average
capital as against 18.5, 13.8, 14.2, 11.7
and 10.4 p.c. back to 1946. A 2\ p.c.
bonus was sent out with the 10 p.c. div.,
making 12| p.c. for the year, leaving
£84,696 to plough back into the business.
The cautious board considered it
“judicious to add further to the co.’s
monetary reserves, and thereby soundly
safeguard shareholders’ interests.”
And the \l\ p.c. was sweetened with
a par issue of 200,000 new £1 shares, one
for three, early in the term. To finance
still further expansion, another 200,000
new £1 shares were issued, one for four,
this time at a premium of 10s. each, to
those on the register at July 1. The money
is wanted 20s. (including premium) on
application and the balance as required.
Here is a picture of the growing busi-
ness from another angle:

To meet net additions of £1,243,975 to
advances, £95,742 to stocks, £20,668 to
plant and £30,662 to freeholds, share-
holders put up an extra £184,336, £801,622
was added to the outside debt, and cash,
etc., was drawn upon for £293,547.
Advances and creditors are largely inter-
related, being wool and other transactions
unsettled at balancing date.
The current season opened with the
average price about 64 p.c. below the
March peak, and the decline continued,
reaching over 72 p.c. on Sept. 21 ; the
figure recovered to 52 p.c. of the
March peak on Oct. 12, and has
fluctuated since. For the three months
to Sept. 30 the Australian average
per bale was £B3 ss. sd. compared with
£145 18s. Bd. for the corresponding period
of the previous season, a drop of 43 p.c.
The statistical position of the staple is
clear, but difficult to interpret. Whatever
may happen in the short-run, there is
nothing to suggest that the price of wool
will be depressed by emergence of a
burdensome surplus. Appearances are that
the average price for the current season
will be better than any except the highly-
inflated 1950-51 average. However, rising
costs and higher taxation will narrow
the net result to both producers and
distributors.
At 455. 6d. the co.’s f.-p. pound shares
return 5.6 p.c. on a 12£ p.c. distribution,
or 4.4 p.c. should the rate drop to 10 p.c.
The immediate return on the contribs. at
295. 6d. is 4.2 p.c. on a 12| p.c. div. basis,
or 6.3 p.c. when fully paid. Including
the new issue, net tangible cover is 375. 3d.

Highlights of the latest accounts of
this well-entrenched Brisbane brewer,
which has strong connections throughout
the south and south-west of the State,
are (I) the improvement of £40,532 in
declared net earnings, (2) disclosure of
£200,000 previously reserved for con-
tingencies and lumped with creditors, etc.,
in the published accounts, and (3) further
strengthening of the co.’s trading and
financial position.
The increase in net earnings was due
mainly to the combined effects of ex-
panding turnover and a lift in the brewer’s
proportion of the controlled selling-price
of beer —first thing of the kind for quarter
of a century or more. It was to help
take care of the steep rise in cost of
manufacture and distribution, previously
offset by the buoyancy of turnover, that
the increase in selling-price was granted.
For the year to June 30 last beer pro-
duction in Australia increased by 10.9 p.c.,
reaching a record 173 million gallons,
equal to 20.8 gallons per head of popula-
tion as against 19.3 gallons for the previ-
ous year and 12.1 gallons for 1938-39.
The co.’s turnover, gross earnings and
exes., etc., are not broadcast. But after
allowing £20,603 (up £7209) for deprecia-
tion and something for taxation and other
contingencies, net earnings were figured
at a record £192,141. That was equal to
12.8 p.c. on capital as against 10.1, 9.5,
9.9, 10.1 and 9.4 p.c. back to 1946. The
cautious board kept the div. at 8 p.c.,
and sent the usual £2500 to the staff
fund, leaving £69,641 to visibly plough
back into the business. The disclosure
of £300,000 of inner reserves over the
last two years is a clear indication that
profits have not been overstated in the
past, nor are they likely to be now.
Finances are comfortable, and, with an
eye to the modernisation of the brewery,
hotels, etc., the holding of cash, etc. (up
£167,804 last term), is being vigorously
strengthened:

The year’s expenditure on fixed assets
exceeded the amount written off by
£29,446. The improvement in the more-
or-less liquid surplus (£320,892) was
£240,182, of which £200,000 was on
account of disclosure of inner reserves
already mentioned.
The Treasury, not the brewer, gets all
the benefit from the recent lift of 2s. 7d.
a gallon, making a total of 7s. 2d. a
gallon, in excise on beer. For the brewer,
and other traders, costs are still the ugly
problem, and much depends upon how
soon they flatten out. Recent increases
in taxation, direct and indirect, together
with the high and rising cost of food,
clothing and transport, promise to be a
heavy counterweight against the expan-
sion of turnover which could be expected
otherwise to follow growth of popula-
tion and rising wage-rates.
The price of the co.’s f.-p, 12s. 6d.
shares has followed the general trend of
the market, rising from 295. 6d. a year
ago to a peak of 325. 6d. in April, 1951,
and then easing. The immediate return
at 28s. 6d., the figure last week, is 3.5 p.c.
on an 8 p.c. div. basis. Net tangible
cover (book-value) is 20s. 3d. per share,

OF EVERY DESCRIPTION FOR LAND & MARINE SERVICE
to the ranks of Australia’s infant
rayon-textile industry were the
exchange rate, the tariff and
costs. The exchange question
has been resolved for the time
being, at any rate, by the Gov-
ernment taking no action in the
matter. The duty on imported
rayon materials was hoisted to
Is. 6d. a square yard, an increase
of Is. 44d., in June, 1950, thus
eliminating a serious threat of
competition from overseas,
Costs, which have continued to
climb, and have not yet reached
the top of the hill, fought a
losing battle last term against
advancing turnover, which was
pushed forward by bigger output
and sales at higher prices.
The mill, at Wangaratta (Vic.),
came into commercial produc-
tion on a small scale during the
1948 term, when a profit of
£16,340 was earned. Since
then output, which has grown
in volume and variety as more
looms and other plant were put
to work, has found a ready
market, and earnings have
responded, as the figures in the
table show. Last term profit
reached a satisfactory £84,953,
up £14,766. That was after set-
ting aside £113,000' (up £68,000)
for deferred and current taxa-
tion at the increased rates and
allowing £76,635 (up £28,336)
for depreciation. The £84,953
covered the pref. div. and 10.5
p.c. on average ord. capital as
against 9.5 p.c. and 8.8 p.c. for
the two preceding terms. The
div., which rose from a maiden
3 p.c. in 1949 to 4 \ p.c. in 1950,
was lifted to 6 p.c., and the
£31,092 that remained reduced
the amount of capital represented
by intangibles to £5922. The
£19,555 paid to the prefs. in
interest in 1947 and treated as
an asset disappeared from the
books by amalgamation with the
plant item. All things con-
sidered, it has been an encourag-
ing performance.
During the year 413,900 new
£1 ords. were put out at par —
352,500 to public shareholders,
38,000 to the stalf and 23,400 to
Bruck Mills (Canada) in pay-
ment for plant—thus lifting
issued capital at June 30 last to
£1,313,900 in 250,000 5 p.c.
prefs. and 1,063,900 ords., on
which there was £292,706 still
to come. A further 31,600 ords.
were earmarked for issue to the
Canadian co., apparently in
payment for more plant. When
all the issued capital, including
the lastmentioned parcel, is
fully-paid, paid capital will be
£1,345,500, on which the pref.
div. and 6 p.c. to the ords. will
call for £6723 less profit than
was claimed last term. Another
new share-issue, probably one
for two, is contemplated at an
early date.
The financial position
improved, the more -or - less
liquid surplus being £143,262
stronger at £409,280:

The additional £121,507 of
share capital, together with
surplus earnings and provisions
and an extra £271,897 from
sundry creditors, was used to
wipe out the overdraft (£187,104
at the previous balance), carry
more stocks (up £164,498) and
book debts (up £118,405) and
strengthen plant (up £26,623).
So long as the tariff keeps
overseas competitors (Japan is
about to join their ranks) at
bay, local rayon-fabric producers
are assured of a ready market.
However, rising wage and other
costs, higher taxation and grow-
ing buyer resistance to lifts in
selling-prices promise to be a
heavy handicap to further in-
crease in the earning-power of
capital.
The f.-p. ords., which fetched
325. in May, stood at 235. 9d.
last week, giving an immediate
return of 5 p.c. on a 6 p.c. div.
basis. The prefs. are priced at
paj;. Including uncalled and
unpaid capital, net tangible cover
at June 30 was £5 7s. Id. prefs.
and 19s. lid. ords.
Eldorado Tennant Creek
Operating on the east-west
line of lode south of Tennant
Creek, this co. has been one of
the most consistent and profit-
able producers on an erratic
field. Because it is handling
high-grade ore, mounting costs
have hit it less severely than
medium-grade and marginal
producers. For the year to June
30 last working costs rose by
30s. 5d., reaching £6 4s. 9d. per
ton, due to wage-lifts and higher
prices for stores and materials.
Also, less gold was recovered,
owing to a lighter crushing, and
there was a drop of £11,723 in
the profit. Here are operating
figures for the last five years:
—Div. ■,
Ore Head Gold Per
Trtd..Value,Recov’d,Profit. 2s. Total.

’5l 4885 22.6 3783 23,737 1/3 19,379
Still, enough was earned to
repeat the Is. 3d. div. (62| p.c.),
making total payments over the
last eight years Bs, per 2s. share,
or 400 p.c. No quarterly div.
was paid in Sept, last, because
of expenditure on development,
housing and the cyanide plant.
Still, more profit is expected to
be earned during the current
year.
Proved ore at June 30 was
22,272 tons, assaying from
12dwt. to 22dwt., and there is
still some stuff in the upper levels
that warrants exploration now
that the cyaniding plant is in
action. A hole is also being
drilled to test the anomaly dis-
closed by a Government geo-
physical survey in 1936. So far
two small mineralised belts have
been encountered, but a lot more
work has to be done before the
programme is complete.
The cyaniding plant, which
came into operation on Aug. 20,
should give earnings a nice lift.
Some final adjustments have
still to be made, but a high per-
centage of recovery is indicated.
It is expected to handle 60 tons
of material per day for seven
days a week, and the conveyor
belt, which is to bring residues
from a “very large” dump to the
vats, should be in operation by
the end of this year.
Including stores (£19,866),
current assets totalled £42,307
and current liabilities £3873
when the books closed. Paid
capital is £31,006 in f.-p. 2s.
shares, which the market prices
at 12s. 9d. each.

Value in the Pound
The question of value and the
pound grows more insistent with
each rise in the basic wage. The
coming 12 months should do
something to answer this ques-
tion, as at last the Federal Gov-
ernment is taking financial and
other action to come to holts
with the problem.
Unfortunately the Govern-
ment, in any action it under-
takes, will be “fighting with one
hand behind its back,” as the
Prime Minister said after the
defeat of the anti-Red refer-
endum. Whilst Communism or
any other “ism” should not be
made a scapegoat for all our
shortcomings, the fact remains
that the Communist party is in
Australia for the sole present
purpose of organising financial
and industrial disaster for us,
and it seizes upon any strain or
distortion in our economy or
social system to further its evil
objectives. The party fosters
dissension and class-hatred, and
it has made it ever so much
more difficult for us to deal, as
a people, with all the post-war
problems that require a united
effort for their solution.
But the Communist party will
haveTo be dealt with, and it will
be a much more detailed
problem, for the Government,
than any financial action against
inflation that it has so far taken.
Much of the financial policy of
the Government is being carried
out for it by the banking system
and by the Treasury in the
ordinary course of its operations.
Dealing with Communism and
industrial strife will be a job
calling for a great deal more
active Ministerial supervision.
The Government, on the other
hand, can make or break itself
on its delegated financial policy
as easily as in its more obvious
activities.
Already the effects of the new
credit policy are being felt.
Within a couple of months of
its implementation it can be
said that most commodities,
barring building materials and
food, are once more being sold
by their manufacturers, and not
merely bought on a quota by
the distributor or consumer.
Clothing has been affected in
particular. In the piecegoods
trade there have been wide-
spread cancellations of orders.
Retailers are in some cases cut-
ting prices in order to lighten
stocks. And a number of
importers have recently been
embarrassed by delivery of
overseas orders ahead of time
coinciding with a reduction in
their available bank accommo-
dation.
This sudden contraction of
buying will no doubt check
speculation and discourage
excessive stockpiling. And in
doing so it will serve its purpose.
But it should not bring about a
disaster to Australian industry.
It is more in the nature of a
check in advance of a setback
that may come later on with the
resurgence of overseas competi-
tion. In six months’ time con-
sumer demand will probably be
causing merchants to stock up
on a normal replacement basis
again, but perhaps at prices
lower than would have been the
case if central financial action
had not been taken.
General financial restriction
has also had its psychological
reactions. The optimist of
yesterday is often the pessimist
of today, and he accentuates any
financial trend. There has been
a good deal of sail-shortening
already in businesses that were
existing on ever-rising prices and
the fact that supplies of so many
things were short. Already in
Sydney it is much easier to get
clerical staffs. An advertiser for
a typiste may now get 50 replies
where six months ago he may
have got two. And employment-
agencies are beginning to seek
out employers.
The Federal Budget, too, is
designed to check inflation.
There is no doubt that its general
shape is anti-inflatitmary pro-
vided the Governments, Federal
and State, exercise as much
administrative economy as
private enterprise is expected to
do, and that Government capital
works are given priority in order
of their value to productive
industry.
All Australian enterprise,
public and private, is at present
frustrated to a large extent by
shortage of materials, fuel,
power and transport, and the
last two are very often Govern-
ment responsibilities. Therefore ,
private capital expenditure must, .
in some cases, give way to
public-works needs. The neces- I
sity for improved rail and road
facilities is obvious, and so is the
call for greater power produc- I
tion. But shipping, mostly in
private hands, needs a high
priority also, and so it is with
many other privately-controlled
essential industries.
So far as State public works
are concerned, the departmental
good faith would be better
appreciated if transport tax on
road vehicles was lifted during
periods in which railways are
unable to cope with freight
offering.
To get any of the lost value
back into the pound we need not
only to improve our mechanical
production facilities; more than
anything else we need a greater
effort per day from our man-
power. Unless the hourly rate
improves, nothing is surer than
that eventually we shall be work-
ing the 44-hour week. Produc-
tivity is the only real answer to
our inflation problem, but many
of the financial controls now
being introduced have the aim
of increasing essential produc-
tion, They need an all-in
backing-up.
Associated Rural Industries,
which controls Australian Rice,
Ltd., and has, through its sub-
sidiaries, interests in starch, wine
and farming enterprises, had a
good year last term (to June 30).
After providing £92,891 for
taxation and £18,591 for depre-
ciation, net profit of the group
was £56,896. Of this, about
£47,000 belonged to Associated
Rural Industries, and was equal
to nearly 14 p.c. on ord. capital,
after allowing for div. on the
6 p.c. prefs. The large provision
for taxation in relation to the
disclosed net profit suggests that
earnings have been conserva-
tively arrived at. The board, in
its annual report, says “The con-
solidated companies enjoyed a
record year, and the accounts
have been finalised on a conser-
vative basis, every precaution
being taken in relation to world
fluctuation in value of stocks,
etc.” Headquarters of the co.
are at Griffith (N.S.W.), and as
a general trading enterprise it
should benefit when the Snowy
River scheme gets under way.
Total distribution to share-
holders in Associated Rural
Industries for its first term as a
public co. was at the rate of
9i p.c. Paid capital is £400,000
in 1,200,000 ss, ords. and
100,000 £1 6 p.c. prefs. The
ss. ords. are at Bs. Id. in the
market, returning 6 p.c. if next

year’s div.-rate increases to
10 p.c. There is still a general
shortage of food, including rice,
but the co.’s business is partly
subject to seasons, though less
so (because of irrigation) than
most rural industries.
* * * ♦
The sharemarket is slow to
respond to good news these
days. Bearing Services’ excel-
lent results (a profit of £206,238,
equal to 23 p.c. on capital) and
9 p.c. tax-free dividend did
nothing to stimulate interest
in the scrip. The 10s. shares,
which had been up to near 205.,
have lately been around 16s. 6d.,
returning 5.4 p.c. on a 9 p.c.
div. basis.
Masonite £1 ord. shares have*
been depressed lately at aboutj
645. They have sold as high as'
83s. this year. Price-control
has been one of the co.’s
problems; it caused a drop in
net profit last year. Now that
the McGirr. price-freeze has
ended, the co. may be in for a
better time, and a new share-
issue is contemplated. This will
not immediately add to profit-
earning, of course, but it will
strengthen future prospects. The
co.’s product is superior to some
of the imported lines of similar
type, and there is a large
demand for all it can produce.
Hence the proposed new share-
issue.

LUDWIG LEICHHARDT
Leichhardt, a Prussian scientist, is remembered for
his long journey in 1844-5 from the Darling Downs
to Port Essington, an early settlement in the far north
of the Northern Territory. He proceeded up the
Burdekin Valley, crossed the Dividing Range, and
discovered the Lynd and Mitchell Rivers. After
following the Mitchell, Leichhardt skirted the shores
of the Gulf of Carpentaria. The exhausted party
lost much valuable equipment at the Roper River,
and finally arrived at Port Essington in December,
1845. He made the return journey by sea.
In 1846-7 Leichhardt was forced by heat and
drought to turn back from an attempt to traverse
Australia from east to west, but shortly afterwards
again set out on an overland journey to Perth. From
this expedition he did not return, and nothing certain
is known of his fate.

MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
The Maoriland Budget
When Prime Minister Holland
cut tax-rates to the tune of
£6,250,000 and shouldered extra
subsidiaries and State benefits
to cost £ll million-odd, in his
high-prosperity Budget, he was
leaning on wool millions that
put all past figures for income
and expenditure in New Zealand
in the shade. After the cuts, he
counted on netting £2B million
more in taxes, at £lB6 million,
than in the past year (to March
31), with income-taxpayers foot-
ing £22.5 million of the increase,
at £117.6 million. Although
£41.6 million of this total is
shown as social-security tax
yield (Is. 6d. in the £), it comes
straight out of N.Z. pockets and
bank accounts like the other £76
million.
Maorilanders will be paying
£l5 a head more directly and
indirectly this year than last, at
an average of just over £96.
M.L. is committed for £25
million for its armed forces in
the current twelvemonth (now
more than half gone)—£lo
million more than in the last
term —and is told it will have to
find £lOO million over the next
few years. It wouldn’t be more
than four years at this rate, and
no one is sure this is the ceiling.
In a spirit of Budget optimism
Mr. Holland said: “New
Zealand’s finances are in a
sound and healthy condition,
production is high, there is
employment for all, and more
goods are available than ever
before. There is an unsatisfied
demand for primary produce,
and earnings abroad exceed
spending. While other countries
are increasing controls, we are
increasing freedom, while they
are raising their taxes we are
reducing ours, while they are
limiting their imports we are
expanding ours.”
In the light of the figures, the
claim that the Government is
easing the burden sounds rather
hollow, and, as for trade with
John Bull, M.L. exporters aren't
happy about selling butter,
cheese and meat at prices below
world levels. As a measure of
taxpaying capacity, the Budget
is misleading unless a good deal
of allowance is made for the
money that is collected to be
handed straight back in benefits
for the aged, the sick, children
and other recipients of the
State’s bounty—a round £55
million this year.
Suppressed Inflation
New Zealand’s triple inflation
controls—stimulation of imports,
tighter control of bank credit
and freezing of £32 million of
boom wool moneys—haven’t
been enough to do the whole
job, so Maoriland is still relying
on price-control over two-thirds
of the items in the consumers’
price-index and on subsidies,
now around £l4 million-odd
yearly, to shelter the rank-and-
file from pressure on costs and
prices. It’s still pinning its faith
on measures to suppress inflation
until it feels controls can be
scrapped or whittled down.
However, in the long run it will
have to adjust itself to external
wage, cost and price levels if it
hopes to get along without the
props handed down by the
Socialists,
This is how things looked to
ex-Director of Stabilisation, Mr.
Leicester C. Webb, when he left
there a few months ago to take
up an academic and research
post at the Australian National
University. In a survey of
trends and changes over the 12
years to 1951, which has
blossomed forth as a Parlia-
mentary “White Paper,” he said
the Government had the choice
of two roads —open or sup-
pressed inflation —and both had
mixed merits.
Said Webb: “Drawbacks of
open inflation are a tendency
for real wages to fall, for those
on fixed incomes to suffer a
lowering of their living
standards, and for investment to
be overstimulated. Advantages
are freedom from controls and
rationing, and absence of short-
ages, though this might be more
appropriately called rationing
through the purse.
“Suppressed inflation protects
fixed-income earners and lessens
industrial friction associated
with rapidly-rising prices. Its
main disadvantage is need to
rely on controls, which lead to
labor and material shortages,
bottlenecks in industry, black-
marketing and other undesir-
able practices. It also per-
petuates, or intensifies, the basic
disequilibrium between supply
and demand for goods and
services at current prices.”
Credit and Taxation
New Zealand is keeping a
respectful distance in following
the Australian trend towards
tighter and dearer money, as
steeply-rising defence spending
brings a squeeze for traders and
individuals who grew into the
habit of leaning on the banks in
the years of easy and cheap
money. In this trend, with the
Reserve Bank tactfully pulling
the strings, the trading banks
have to do the donkey-work on
the other side of the Tasman
much the same as on this, but
they do it with a better grace
in Maoriland, because the
central bank there doesn’t carry
on a large commercial banking
business Jn competition with
them as in Australia.
There’s a closer spirit of co-
operation, with more give and
take, more elasticity and less
rigidity, all of which helps to
keep money and credit flowing
more smoothly in the transition
phase, after the long reign of
3-per-cents.
M.L.’s selective credit system
gives traders and industrialists
free access to funds on overdraft
to carry more costly stocks of
goods or raw materials, and
they’re thankful for this, but
there’s a severe pinch wherever
cos. want capital to spend on
plant or premises. This control
is sound policy, because capital-
spending by cos., as well as by
State departments, has been
inflationary in N.Z., as elsewhere
in the past, but there are com-
plications in the effects of soar-
ing costs and prices, which have
eaten into the value of reserves
set aside years ago, and in the
tendency for taxes to become
partly a capital-levy as untaxed
depreciation allowances fall
short of the purposes for which
they were intended.
Car Prices in Maoriland
Thanks to the sudden slump
in car sales in Canada and U.S.,
New Zealand has been getting
record shipments from Britain
when it thought new models
would be scarce, and this has
ended Maoriland’s boom in used
cars that ruled for several years.
Almost overnight, when the
change came, a couple of
hundred or so was wiped off the
price of cars in the popular
range, many of which up till
then had been whisked from
new- to used-car salesrooms
before they were run-in, to
command a handsome profit.
That was in the heyday of
inflation, which ended soon after
the banks began to clamp down
on credit. Easy money made a
picnic for car-profiteers, as for
other operators in scarce
markets, such as houses, land,
timber, cement, spirits and a
range of lesser lines in years
gone by.
For a time, until N.Z.’s Board
of Trade threw open the door
for new English cars early this
year, there was heavy liquida-
tion of overseas investments to
finance car-purchases »n a “no-
remittance” basis, which gave a
big lift to the car trade in the
last half of 1951 and the opening
weeks of 1952, and holders of
eligible securities made the most
of the chance to net gains.
Instead of a drop, car imports
this year are likely to be up
30 p.c.


The Letters of Rachel Henning
[These letters begin in 1853, when Biddulph, Rachel Henning’s only
brother (then 19, and considered “delicate”), and her sister Annie (33)
sailed for Australia in the auxiUary steam ciipper Great Britain.
Rachel and her sisters Henrietta (“Etta” of the letters, who had married
the Rev. T. W. Boyce in August, 1831) and Amy were thus separated, for
the time being, from Biddulph and Annie.
Rachel’s early letters are addressed from England to Biddulph and
Annie in Australia. She moved around from one part of England to
another, spending her time agreeably with some of her numerous relatives,
and keeping Biddulph and Annie in Australia informed of family, social
and political doings in Britain.
In August, 1834, Rachel and her sister Amy, with their cousin,
Tregenna Biddulpb, left for Australia In the Calcutta. They reached
Melbourne on October 15 and landed in Sydney on October 22. Six days
later Rachel and Amy went to Appin, in N.S.W., where their brother
Biddulph had leased a farm from the Rev, Sparling. Rachel soon became
very unhappy and homesick.
Following Amy’s marriage to Thomas Sloman, of Bathurst, in September,
1835, and while Biddulph was establishing a new place on Bulli Mountain,
Rachel decided to return to England, where she arrived in October, 1856.
She left Amy, Annie and Biddulph behind in Australia.
After nearly five years with her friends and relatives in England,
during which period Tregenna returned home to marry, prior to settling
on the Shoalhaven, Rachel left Liverpool in the clipper Great Britain for
Australia on February 17, 1861. On her arrival she visited Amy in
Bathurst, Tregenna on the Shoalhaven, and then, with Biddulph and
Annie, went to live on Exmoor station in North Queensland which was
Just being developed.
This is the thirteenth instalment of the letters.]
Exmoor,
August 7, 1864.
My Dear Mr. Boyce,
You inquire about Biddulph’s
new “purchase,” but taking up
country is not exactly a
purchase, though it sometimes
costs a good deal. By the new
Land Act, whoever just puts
his stock on a new piece of
country and then puts in his
tenders for it to Government
has the right of occupying that
country as a sheep - run.
Formerly, if anyone saw a piece
of unoccupied country he liked
he could send in tenders for it
and claim it without putting a
sheep upon it. Some men got
a great deal of land this way,
and it to put a stop to land-
“Exactly like Sir John Falstaff.”
jobbing that the new regulation
was made.
Now the process is this —
Biddulph sent out 7000 sheep
under the care of a superin-
tendent with orders to occupy
some land on the Flinders
River which Mr. Devlin had
selected for him. Of course the
sheep took a long time travelling,
Biddulph overtook them just as
they got to the ground, found
it was occupied by another man,
who had gone out faster with
cattle, heard of some better
country 100 miles beyond,
pushed his sheep out there and
“took up” eight blocks, each
containing fifty square miles of
beautiful open downs, stretch-
ing along the bank of the river
for nearly 50 miles.
Having planted his sheep there
he made all speed back here,
rode the five hundred miles in a
very short time, spent a few days
at home, and then went down to
Rockhampton as fast as horses
could carry him to catch the
first steamer for Sydney and put
in his tenders for the land. The
reason of the hurry was that
several people were after that
piece of country, there being
none so good about there, and
if anyone else had put sheep or
cattle on it, and then got in their
tenders before Biddulph, they
would have had the preference,
It is certain, however, that no
one came down as soon as he
did, so he is safe enough,
This new run is not to super-
sede Exmoor and I do not think
he has any intention of moving,
He has left a superintendent, a
Mr. Gilliat, to take care of the
new station, and he will prob-
ably hold it till land becomes
valuable out there—in conse-
quence of squatters pushing out
and taking up all the available
country —and then sell it.
It is wonderful how runs
increase in value as the districts
become settled. When Biddulph
first took up Exmoor it was the
very outside run northwards,
and when he dissolved partner-
ship with the Tuckers a year
after it was valued at £4OOO.
Now it is quite an inside station,
every bit of country is taken up
for several hundred miles round
it, and just before he went to
Sydney Biddulph refused £25,000
for it. A man came up here
from Adelaide with sheep, but
could find no country to put
them on without going hundreds
of miles north, so I suppose he
wanted Exmoor. The rent a
squatter pays to the Government
is £lO a block for the first five
years, and it gradually increases
afterwards.
But I did not intend to inflict
upon you a dissertation on the
Land Acts of Queensland,
though of course every altera-
tion in them is a source of great
interest here. Perhaps you will
like better to hear that we have
just had twenty-four hours’ rain,
a blessing at this time of year
which you must have lived in a
dry climate to appreciate. The
last rain fell in March or April,
and the country was beginning
to look very brown, though it
is wonderful how the grass con-
tinues to spring in this climate
long after you would think there
was not the smallest moisture in
the ground.
The lambing season is just
begun here, and Mr. Taylor, the
sheep-overseer, was beginning to
look very long-faced as to the
prospects of any green grass for
the young lambs, and to antici-
pate another dry lambing
season, such as the year before
last, when we only saved thirty
per cent, and scarcely any other
station did even that, but the day
of the new moon the sky began
to cloud up and continued
cloudy for two or three days.
How we watched for fear it
should blow off again, as it has
done several times before of an
evening. Somebody was con-
tinually looking out and coming
back with a report that “stars
were visible,” a piece of in-
formation which was greeted by
a general groan and ejaculations
of “What a bore!” or “It is all
over with the lambs.”
However, one afternoon it
began to rain, poured steadily
that night and more or less all
next day. You could all but see
the grass grow. The second day
places where there were nothing
but stones began to show green.
The lambs are saved, though we
can hardly expect
such a lambing as
last year nearly
ninety-five per cent.
—but it is a great matter for
thankfulness, this rain.
Perhaps in another six weeks
we may get another twenty-four
hours of it to carry us on till
Christmas, when the rainy
season begins.
Biddulph will only spend
about a week in Sydney and
come home as quickly as he can.
We expect him in a fortnight.
I had a nice letter from him
announcing his safe arrival at
Rockhampton without meeting
any bushrangers. They tried to
set up the profession in Queens-
land as it flourishes so in
N.S.W., but the squatters did not
see it, and on the first attempt
(viz., stopping the Marlborough
mail), a pursuit was raised and
never stopped till of the four
men concerned two were shot
and the other two captured, and
there has been no bushranging
since.
Pen-drawings by
Norman Lindsay
With much love to yourself
and the darling children,
believe me, my dear brother,
Ever yours affectionately.
Rachel Henning.
Exmoor,
August 8, 1864.
My Dearest Etta,
You seem surprised at our
extensive housekeeping, but in
fact there is none here. It
would be distracting if we had
to keep house for the entire
station. Every dray that comes
brings its load of flour, tea,
sugar and minor luxuries and
necessaries, and everything is
stowed away in the store, a large
building at the back of the
house, which is fitted’ up with a
counter, weights, etc., like a
shop. Mr. Hedgeland is store-
keeper at present, and he dis-
penses to the shepherds, bush-
men, bullock-drivers and all
employees their weekly rations
of 81b. flour, 21b, sugar, |lb. tea
and 161 b. beef nominally, though
practically this latter article is
unlimited.
The Irish family in the kitchen
have so much a week of the same
allowed them, though they are
not kept strictly to any allow-
ance, and everything extra that
the station people want they pay
for, such as pickles, vinegar,
currants, sardines, jam, etc.
So you see we have nothing
to do with them. There is a
pantry in the house where all
our things are kept, just as in
your pantry at home. Tins of
sugar, tapioca, rice, sago, etc.,
and these are filled from the
store as wanted. Annie keeps
house for us —that is, she makes
puddings and pies and orders
dinner just as you would for a
small family at home.
Our things are quite separate.
The remains of puddings, etc.,
are always put back in the
pantry, unless given to the
servants. When the milk is
brought in, it is set in the same
pantry. Annie skims it and
makes the butter if there is
plenty; the servants are given
some ; if not, they do without.
It is by no means a rights as it
is in England. If they want
currants or anything of that kind
they buy them out of the store.
The store contains, also, boots
and all kinds of men’s clothes
and nearly everything you can
think of as necessary in the
bush. Mr. Hedgeland enters
whatever he gives out or sells in
a day-book, and I keep the
station-books, enter whatever
the men buy with their wages in
a debtor and creditor account,
and make up weekly and
monthly the entire consumption
of the station. All that is sold
and given out.
When we have six or eight
shearers here be-
sides the usual
inhabitants the
figures are very
long. We kill our own beef.

is hunted in and slain. The best
joints are reserved for the house,
an immense roasting and splut-
tering takes place all over the
station, and the rest is salted
down into casks and kept in the
meat-store, a small room behind
the other store. We have a
smoking-house now, made of
zinc where the beef kept for the
house is hung up and smoked
with damp wood. An immense
improvement on the cask beef.
I have given you quite a long
description of our menage, but
there is not much news to tell
you this month. We are looking
for Biddulph coming home in
about a fortnight and very glad
I shall be. The place is quite
different when he is here. He is
the pleasantest of people to live
with, and none of the thousand-
and-one vexations of a station
ever put him out of temper.
They were talking of drafting
sheep last night. One of the
most provoking of employments,
as the obstinacy and power of
passive resistance in a sheep is
something wonderful, and Mr.
Taylor said that Biddulph was
the only man he ever saw who
took it quietly and did not get
in a rage.
Since I last wrote to you the
station has been enlivened by an
elopement. During the absence
of Alick (the blackboy who
fought so valiantly on the
Flinders), Billy, the other station
blackboy, ran away with Biddy,
the wife of the aforesaid Alick.
Alick came back the next day,
and his rage was great when he
found out his loss, especially as
they had taken ail his property
with them, and particularly
355., which comprised his
worldly wealth and which he
kept tied up in an old sock.
He picked out a formidable
“waddy” and set out in pursuit,
vowing vengeance. In the mean-
time Billy and Biddy, finding
running - away not quite so
pleasant as they had expected,
came back the third day in a
very penitent state of mind.
The nights were very cold just
then. They had had “nothing
to eat but cold water,” and
Biddy said “I believe mine cry
good deal, cry all day.” Billy
fled to the Two-mile station to
be out of the way of Alick’s
wrath. Biddy was obliged to
abide it, but he was persuaded
not to give her the beating he
promised, and which she
certainly deserved, and in a few
days they became good friends,
especially as he recovered the
precious 355.
Since that Alick has been ill
and Biddy has made her peace
by carefully attending him. He
caught cold and had a sort of
chest attack, and used to lie in
his hut and groan and cough
and ydl alternately. Biddy came
down one morning: “I believe
that fellow dead,” she said. We
went up to see after him and

Exmoor,
September 17, 1864.
My Dearest Etta,
Biddulph brought up the
English letters with him. We
were so delighted to see him
back, for we were getting quite
uneasy about hipi and began to
fancy all sorts of things which
might have happened on the
road.
He has been away just ten
weeks. The delay was partly
caused by the loss of three
horses, between here and Rock-
hampton. He bought a buggy
and pair of horses in Sydney,
brought the whole turn-out
safely up to Rockhampton by
the steamer and was on his road,
driving up here, when one night
the horses were stolen, as he
supposed, for if they had only
strayed they could not fail to
have been found in the three
days that Biddulph stayed look-
ing for them, and an innkeeper,
close by there, has a very bad
name for stealing horses and
then hiding them till a large
reward is offered for finding
them and then producing them
and claiming the money. Bid-
dulph thinks that this is what
has become of his beautiful pair
of bays, though, of course, they
may have been stolen altogether
and ridden off to the diggings.
However it was, he could not
wait any longer, for he was
greatly wanted at Exmoor, so
he took the buggy back to the
nearest station and left it there
and came on with the saddle-
horses. He offered a large
reward for finding the horses
and has hopes of recovering
them, but the disaster happened
nearly two hundred miles from
here. So I doubt if the buggy
will ever be sent down for. I
think it is more likely to be
sold in Rockhampton.
It was very vexing and disap-
pointing for Biddulph, for he
had bought it entirely for us
because he thought we should
like it for driving out in, and
very pleasant it would have
been. The old dog-cart, in which
we came up, is on its last legs.
However, fate was against us
in this instance.
Biddulph seems greatly to
have enjoyed his visit to Sydney,
for though his mornings were
all taken up by business, he used
to spend his afternoons in driv-
ing out the young ladies of his
acquaintance and his evenings in
visiting. His business prospered,
too, for he got his licences for
the new Flinders run without
any difficulty, and is formally
installed in possession.
He came home to hear bad
news, however. We are visited
with another drought. There
has been no rain to speak of
since March, and, of course,
where there is no green grass
there will be no lambs; their
mothers cannot rear them. We
are getting a very bad lambing
and all our neighbors are ki the
same plight, except one man,
who, having a run that is under
water in the wet season, of
course enjoys the benefit of it
now.
On one station, about thirty
miles from here, they are actually
knocking the lambs on the head
as fast as they come, to save the
ewes. We are not so bad as
that, but instead of ninety-five
or one hundred per cent., as we
got last year, we shall probably
not have thirty-five per cent.
These dry seasons are very
worrying for Biddulph, and a
great loss.
We had quite a budget of
letters brought up by Biddulph
and one parcel. When he lost
the horses, he brought it on with
him on his pack-horse, which I
consider a great piece of
brotherly kindness, for he had
plenty to carry. He also
brought us up a little kitten.
He saw some very pretty ones
at Waverley and asked for one.
It was so young it could not
see when he took it. Of course
there was no milk to be had,
and he used to boil a bit of meat
into broth for her and pour it
into her mouth out of a pint-
pot when he camped. She used
to ride in Mr. Alford’s pocket,
and she throve under the treat-
ment, and travelled the one
hundred and fifty miles quite
safely, and is now growing and
improving upon any quantity of
milk. She drinks it all day. She
will be a very handsome cat, a
very dark tabby.
This puts me in mind of
Charles Henning. I was talking
to Biddulph about him this
morning, and he says that if he
comes out he must do so entirely
on his own responsibility, and
that there is very little prospect
for anyone out here now who
has not a large capital to begin
with —£8000 or £lO,OOO at least.
Out of four seasons, two of
them have been dry. About
six weeks ago we had a fall of
rain, and we all rejoiced and
thought the grass would grow
and the lambs be saved, but a
succession of cold frosty nights
came after the rain, and nipped
off the young spring—and our
hopes. The weather is glorious,
but the country looks terribly
dry and brown, and we cannot
get anything to grow. Last year,
at this time, we had lettuces and
several sorts of vegetables, and
now we have none. These dry
seasons are very tiresome. How-
ever, it will rain bye and bye,
and, meantime, we get on as
well as we can.
I should be sorry to leave
Exmoor on many accounts, but
I do not dislike the idea of
further rambles and journeys in
this wild country, and a settle-
ment on the broad prairies of
the Flinders. We may never
go, but, as I said before, it is
possible.
How I should like to be with
you sometimes, but I think it
will be a long time first, especi-
ally if we go out to the Flinders,
as in that case Biddulph will
not very likely marry for a long
time, unless he were to fall in
love before he goes, if go he
does.
I do not think I am likely to
return to England unless Bid-
dulph were to marry, much as
I wish to see you all again ; and,
fond as I am of home, I do
greatly enjoy the lovely climate,
good health and free outdoor
life that we have here, and,
though I like Aunt Vizard and
love her, She would be a poor
exchange for Biddulph, who is
the very kindest of brothers and
the pleasantest person in the
world to live with.
I can be of some use to him,
too. Annie keeps house and
cooks, etc., but I keep all his
books and accounts, copy his
letters and invoices and am
generally his clerk, and it is a
department I much prefer to
making puddings.
I was amused at Aunt’s idea,
in her last letter, that we should
feel like Nodenic the Goth at
the “unaccustomed face of
man,” the fact being that I never
in my life saw so many strangers,
and that, too, from all parts of
the world—some fresh from
England, some from Sydney,
Adelaide, the Far North and
all parts of Australia. A
Mr. Steward, who was lately
had spent half his

life in Madagascar; another
had just come from India,
another from California, etc.,
etc. We have had quite a
housefull lately,
A Mr. Huxham has been stay-
ing here some time to look after
some cattle which he has on a
run over the Broken River, and
which he wants to sell. He is
very pleasant and agreeable, and
helps me look for ray pet lambs.
Mr. Woodward has also been
here again, and a friend of his,
Mr. Whitley, who is a
great geologist and discourses
learnedly of the curious fossils
we find here. Also Mr. Wiggins,
the Pleuro-pneumonia Commis-
sioner, a most comical old
gentleman. He is very fat and
exactly like pictures I have seen
of Sir John Falstaff. He is
very amusing, and seems to have
read everything and comes out
with the funniest quotations.
When Biddulph came up by
the steamer this time he met
with a Mr. Hill, with whom he
was very much pleased ; he was
a great botanist, geologist and a
very agreeable man to boot.
Biddulph asked him to come up
here in his rambles, and I wish
he would. I should like to know
the names of the flowers we find
here.
Biddulph showed him the
poison plant that grows in the
desert between here and the
Flinders and which killed so
many of our sheep. He named
it directly and took some to
analyse. Biddulph left some with
several gentlemen in Sydney in
hopes of getting it analysed. It
must have some intensely
poisonous principle in it akin to
strychnine, they say. The sheep
went quite mad after eating it.
It is a pretty shrub with whitish
leaves and a crimson pea-shaped
blossom, not at all poisonous-
looking.
Mr. Devlin (formerly the
station superintendent) has just
started to mark a new road to
Port Denison. The present road
makes a great round to avoid
the ranges, and the distance is
one hundred and ten miles. Mr.
Devlin thinks he can find a road
through the coast range by keep-
ing along a spur, which will be
as good as the other and will
shorten the distance thirty miles.
If anyone can do it, he can, for
he is a capital bushman, and it
will shorten the journey to the
port for the bullock-drays by
five or six days, making the
journey three weeks instead of
a month, as it is now.
Your most affectionate sister,
Rachel Henning.
Exmoor,
October 11, 1864.
My Dearest Etta,
A good station-manager needs
a thorough knowledge of stock
and of country, besides much
tact and at the same time deci-
sion in dealing with the very
free and independent gentry
whom we have to employ as
shepherds, stockmen, bushmen,
etc.
The difference in the go of the
station when Biddulph is here
and when he is absent is just
that of trying to get along a
rusty creaking vehicle on a rough
road and the progress of the
same machine on a smooth road
and with all the iscrews, and
wheels oiled. Biddulph is a
capital master. He never lets any
of the men gain the least advan-
tage over him and yet they all
like him.
I am happy to say that Bid-
dulph heard by the last mail that
the pair of buggy-horses he lost
on the Rockhampton road have
turned up all safe, so perhaps we
may get the buggy here yet,
though if we move it may be
sold. But we should want
....Groaning and shivering without a rag on him."
some sort of vehicle to drive out
to the Flinders.
We had such a pleasant day’s
excursion yesterday. Annie and
myself, with Biddulph and Mr.
Taylor, started about 11 for a
spot on the Broken River, about
five miles from here, where there
are some fine rocks and capital
fishing. A little way from the
station we met Mr. Hedgeland
on his way home from Port
Denison, where he has been to
load a dray, which Biddulph is
sending out to the Flinders.
Biddulph has a quantity of
goods sent from Sydney and
stored in one of the warehouses
at the Port and part of them had
to be selected and a great many
cases opened, so Mr. Hedgeland
went down to do it. He looked
very sunburnt and grimy, and
declined turning round and go-
ing with us, so we stopped to
hear the news and then went on
our way. We got to the rocks
about one. I had never seen
them before, and I never, in this
part of the world, saw anything
so fine as the tumbled masses of
grey rock, the long reaches of
blue water and the rocky wooded
banks. I made two sketches,
but they do not give any idea of
the place. Nothing but a first-
rate colored drawing could do
so.
As soon as the horses were un-
saddled and turned out on some
beautiful green grass we
scrambled down the steep bank
till we found a nice shady place
under some rocks, by a large
tree, and then Annie and I
lighted a fire, while Biddulph and
Mr. Taylor went to catch some
fish for dinner. They soon came
back with some fine black bream.
These Mr. Taylor broiled on the
embers, and very nice they were.
We had brought some bread, a
tin of jam, and with the universal
“quart-pot tea” we made a
capital dinner.
Then Biddulph and Mr. Taylor
got their horses and set off to
ride a mile or two on the other
side of the river to look at some
green feed which was reported to
be there, and on which they
thought they could put a flock
of sheep. Annie and I took the
opportunity of their absence to
get a beautiful bathe in the river.
We avoided the deep holes for
fear of alligators and chose a
place where the water was run-
ning over rocks and so clear we
could see the bottom. We en-
joyed it so very much.
Then I proceeded to make
frantic efforts to sketch the place
while Annie fished; then Bid-
dulph and Mr. Taylor came back
and fished till sundown. They
caught some black bream and*
catfish, and when it began to get
dark we packed up our traps,
caught and saddled the horses
and set out for home.
The next thing we did was to
lose our way. There was some
thick bush to go through before
we reached the road, and we got
talking and did not notice that
our horses were following their
own wills till we were suddenly
stopped by a precipice, and, on
investigation, there was the
Broken River at our feet. We
had got back to it instead of
getting on to the road. It was
very dark, for the sun had set
and the moon not risen. How-
ever, we turned round and set
off the other way. In a short
time after a little more riding
Mr. Taylor and Biddulph, who
were going first, to find the way,
pulled up again. There was the
Broken River once more, ahead
of us. It winds very much here.
“We’ll keep out from it this time
at any rate,” Biddulph said, so
on we went till we came to an-
other steep bank. “This must
be some gully,” Biddulph said.
Mr. Taylor got a little way down
the bank to examine. “By
George,” he said, “it’s the Broken
River again!” We all laughed,
for it seemed as if we were be-
witched and were condemned to
wander up and down the Broken
River for the rest of our natural
lives.
It was extremely dark just
then, and there was nothing for
it but to ride slowly in the most
probable direction till the moon
rose, so that we would see the
distant ranges of hills which
would set us right at once.
Presently up she came, but two
days past the full. Then the
Dart Ranges appeared on one
side and the Tenthill and Black-
wall ranges on another, and we
knew our direction at once ; and
a quarter of an hour’s ride
brought us out on the plains
again.
It seemed very absurd to be
lost on the Broken River, five
or six miles from home, especi-
ally as Biddulph is a very good
bushman ; but not having noticed
the direction we took at first,
it was almost impossible to find
out where we were till there was
light enough to see something
beyond the stems of the trees.
We had a nice moonlight ride
home, and got back about nine,
to the great joy of the famished
family, who I am afraid wanted
their dinners.
The pet lambs were shorn this
morning. Biddulph very kindly
promised the shearers a bottle of
grog to shear them nicely and
not cut them, and accordingly
they appeared coming down

from the woolshed about break-
fast-time, very well shorn and
only one of them cut a little.
But looking such little objects!
They will begin to recover their
good-looks in a month or so,
and it must be a great relief to
them to have their fleeces off this
hot weather.
Will you thank Mr, Boyce very
much for his letter to me. My
very kindest love to him and
yourself and the children,
Ever, dearest Etta, your most
affectionate sister,
Rachel Henning.
Exmoor,
November 27, 1864.
My Dear Mr. Boyce,
I wrote to Etta by the last
mail. It is very satisfactory that
we have lately had thunderstorms
nearly every day and the grass is
growing as if by magic. In dear
rainy old England you can hardly
imagine how glad we are when
the first rain falls after a long
drought. How the green grass
springs everywhere where before
there was nothing to be seen but
stones and dust. I think the
East must be something like this.
In these hot countries there can-
not be a more pleasant image
than “rivers of water in a dry
place the shadow of a great rock
in a weary land.”
How 1 should like to spend
another Christmas with you all!
I wonder will it ever be. We
shall be a small party this Christ-
mas at Exmoor, for Mr. Taylor
is already gone to the Flinders,
Mr. Hedgeland will follow him
in about a fortnight, and Alford
is going to the Port on his way
to England as soon as he can
find his horse, which has either
absconded or been stolen. There
will be only Biddulph here, with
the exception of any visitors we
may have.
1 was terribly afraid Biddulph
would go out to the Flinders
himself. Biddulph is afraid they
will be short of provisions on
Lara station before the horse-
dray which accompanies the
sheep can reach them, so Mr.
Hedgeland is to take a small
supply of packhorses and travel
out as fast as possible.
A great deal of stock is going
out to the Flinders now. We
have just had a large party here
branding cattle in our yards be-
fore taking them out. They
departed last Saturday, and I
think they must have been quite
glad to get away, for nothing but
misfortunes befel them during
the last day or two.
Mr. Woodward set the fashion.
A beast charged him in the yard,
charged him again while he was
climbing the fence, and some-
how knocked him over it, a fall
of about seven feet. They all
thought he had broken his neck,
but he escaped with a good shake
and some bad bruises.
The same day Mr. Tooth, who
is in charge of the cattle, cut his
wrist right across the tendons
and lost the use of his two middle
fingers. His hand was terribly
swelled and very painful, and
we wanted him to go to the Port
for advice, but he tied it up
with cold-water bandages and it
got better. He is gone out to
the Flinders now, but 1 think it
doubtful if he will recover the
use of the two fingers.
That same evening Mr. Alford
went up to the forge, where a
stranger’s horse was being shod,
and most foolishly jumped on
its back. He is no rider, and
the horse threw him at once and
then he kicked him when down
just on the temple. He had on
a thick felt hat which probably
saved his fife. The hat and
leather lining were cut through
and his temple cut to the bone,
which was slightly splintered.
Mr. Woodward sewed up the cut
and he kept cold-water cloths on
it. His head was terribly swelled
and he suffered much from head-
ache for some days, but he, too,
has recovered and walks about
with his head plastered up and
one eye very bloodshot from the
effect of the blow.
As if this was not enough
Julian went out the next day to
drive in a wild cow from the
bush and was foolish enough to
get off his horse to drive her
through a scrub, when she turned
and charged him, threw him up
in the air twice, and the second
time he says he came down on
her back. However that may be,
he scrambled up a tree, and
finally escaped from the scrim-
mage minus his hat and with his
garments woefully torn. He left
the cow watching his hat under
the impression that his head was
inside it.
Finally Mr. Holdane, another
of the cattle party, had three of
his front teeth knocked out by
the horse he was on suddenly
me norse. ne was on suddenly
throwing her head back when
Holdane was stoonim* forward
iioiaane was stooping torward.

Women’s Letters
From Melbourne
Over 1000 attended the Navy, Army
and Air Force Club’s Derby Eve Ball,
which was revived for the first time since
pre-war days. Members of the R.A.A.
formed the guard for the vice-regal party.
Lady Brooks wore a gown of pearl-tinted
satin which had a wide skirt and the
bodice a soft fichu drape. Mrs. Kingsley
Norris, whose husband, Major-General
Norris, is president of the club, chose a
deep-aqua-blue crepe gown and beaten-
silver stole. The Lady Mayoress, Mrs.
John Inkster, wore deep-royal-blue satins
highlighted with silver sequins. Lady
Collins was in dove-grey chiffon. Mrs.
W. M. J. Eaton wore a gown of ink-blue-
and-silver brocade. Lady Blarney’s satins
were woven with a self-pattern on a white
ground. Mrs. R. W. Spraggett’s gown
was hyacinth-blue. Mrs. M. Renou’s
dove-grey chiffons had opalescent bead
trimmings. Mrs. Charles Gale’s black
tulle had a pattern of gold thread on the
strapless bodice. Mrs. Sandy Lowe’s
orchid-pink duchess-satin frock was
strapless.
H.M.A.S. Australia, in port for Opera-
tion Cup Day, was gay with flags and
buntings when the First Naval Member,
Vice-Admiral Sir John Collins, with Lady
Collins, received many guests at a late-
afternoon party. Lady Collins’s silk frock
was grey-and-white spotted, her hat a
smart alliance of gold-and-white straw.
Jeanette Brooks’s navy taffeta frock had
a deep yoke continuing into short sleeves
of white Chantilly lace; her tiny blue
hat was finished with an osprey. Mrs.
Charles Reid’s beige-and-black-patterned
tie-silk frock was worn with a large black
picture-hat. Mrs. Roy Dowling added a
small black velvet cap to her black frock.
Mrs Cyril Dickson had a matching hat
for her powder-blue crepes. A hat of
white-and-silver lace was worn by Mrs.
Edward Campbell with her slim black
faille coat. Dr. Ann Bridge chose a pale-
lilac nylon frock and small white hat. A
turquoise-and-gold-patterned national
gown was worn by Madame Liu, wife of
the Chinese Consul.
Officers of R.A.A.F. Headquarters
Mess were hosts at what should have
been a very formal ball at St. Kilda Town
Hall, but which was happily shorn of
formality by plenty of table-hopping.
Mrs. George Jones, wife of Air-Marshal
Jones, wore orchid-pink chantilly lace.
Lady Fogarty, wife of Malaya’s Air
Chief, chose turquoise-blue brocade and
a hip-length Chinese jacket of matching
faille. Mrs. Frank Bladen’s bouffant
gown was of royal-blue net over
cyclamen satin. Mrs. A. Charlsworth
wore soft rose chiffons. Mrs. S. F.
Rowell, who was with her husband, Lt.-
General Rowell, wore ice-blue satins
which had bead-embroideries. Mrs. Eric
Hewitt’s frock was of pink lame, Mrs.
Dick Creswell’s of steel-blue velvet. Mrs.
Harcourt Smith’s deep-sage-green moire-
faille frock had a draped hipline. Mrs.
Philip Dare’s black tulle gown had a
three-tiered skirt. Mrs. E. S. Wackett
danced in white tulle. Mrs. Val Hancock
contrasted her powder-blue crepe frock
with a cerise tulle stole.
For her marriage at Melbourne Gram-
mar School Chapel to Henry George, son
of Mr. and Mrs. G. A. Kemter, of
Heidelberg, Shirley Lenore, only child of
Mr. and Mrs. W. B. Thomas, of Elwood,
wore a gown of silver-and-white French
brocade. The fully-pleated skirt of
beaded chiffon was worn under a trained
overskirt of brocade. Crystal beads
encrusted the Mary Stuart cap of shirred
tulle which held the full-length tulle veil,
and her bouquet was of white orchids.
Judy Brasch was bridesmaid, and the
bridegroom’s nieces, Gillian and Jennifer
Bird, were flower-girls. All three
attendants wore turquoise-blue marqui-
sette ; seed-pearls studded the cap worn
by the bridesmaid, whilst the flower-girls
wore dainty poke-bonnets. lan Smith
was best man (he will marry the brides-
maid in a few weeks’ time).
Reception was held at the New
Alexandra in East St. Kilda. The bride’s
mother received the guests wearing a
gown of orchid-pink faille embellished
with gold beads and rhinestones in deep
mauve ; her tiny flower hat matched her
bouquet of pink and cyclamen miniature
orchids. Mrs. Kemter wore a dinner-
gown of black French crepe, the skirt
of which was finely pleated ; her picture-
hat was of black velvet. Among the
guests were the Jeff Frazers and Mrs.
Eric Hawkins, from Sydney. Other
guests were Mrs. Charles Lane, in ice-
blue satin ; Mrs. Joan Ente, swathed in
masses of coral-pink tulle and with a
gold sequin strapless bodice for contrast;
Mrs. G. Carrick, who wore gold-studded
burgundy crepe; Mrs. W. Digby in
hyacinth-blue crepe ; Mrs. G. Tuxen, her
satins ciel-blue ; Mrs. Alan Bird, whose
gown of floral satin had American-beauty
satin shoulder-straps; Mrs. Frank Lee
wearing floral chiffon and Mrs. Vernon
Jones in parma-violet chiffon.
The dulcet voice of Donald Novis, the
amazing split-second timing of Rosita
and Alexander’s dancing, and the breath-
taking act of a Chinese group make up a
few of the ingredients of “Peep Show,”
the current Tivoli offering. In the large
audience were the W. B. Faulkners, who
were with Mr. and Mrs. W. Plpwman,
Mrs. Norman Lynch with Adelaide visi-
tor Mrs. L. W. Leahy, Mrs. W. Graves,
on a holiday from Surfers’ Paradise, Mrs.
Frank Martin, Mrs. Norman Spry, Mrs.
S. Aarons and Mrs. W. McDermott.
Patric, younger daughter of Dr. and
Mrs. T. J. K. Whittam, of South Mel-
bourne, is pictured here wearing one of
the hats she bought in Paris. Pat has
just returned from a 12-months trip
abroad, which included a motor-bike tour
with a girl-friend; they went through
Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Germany and
Holland. When her companion returned
to England Pat went to Denmark,
Sweden and Norway and France, where
she took in the autumn fashion showings
in Paris. She has settled down to work
again with her sister Yvonne in their
mllinery salon. Broothorn photo.
The spirit of the pioneer past was for
a brief space recaptured at the Victorian
League Jubilee Ball as descendants of
those who came to this State in the early
1800’s walked down the St. Kilda Town
Hall ballroom to be presented to the
Governor, Sir Dallas Brooks, who was
accompanied by his daughter Jeanette.
The vice-regal party was received by
Mrs. Ronald Austin. The stage was
banked with massed flowers set against
a background of greenery, while above
hung a floral replica of the league’s red-
white-and-blue crest. Spring flowers made
in early-Victorian posies were set on
every table, and silver candelabra hold-
ing tall green candles were a feature of
the decorations on the official table.
There were many family groups, the
largest being that of the descendants of
William Rowe. Poke - bonnets and
hooped skirts were worn by women mem-
bers of the group, while the men wore
plum-colored frock-coats, buff trousers,
tall hats and whiskers. Mrs. James
Buchanan portrayed a descendant of Dr.
Godfrey Howitt, the first medico to set
up practice in Collins-street, and Gordon
and Joan Byron Moore represented the
pioneer Simon Staughton and his wife.
Members of the police force were seen
in a new role when, with their partners,
they performed the 51st reel, a dance
which originated in a p.-0.-w. camp.
Lady Herring’s black crepe-romaine
gown had a deep collar of Honiton lace
outlining the rounded neckline. The
Lady Mayoress, Mrs. John Inkster, was
in satin-striped black faille. Mrs. R. W.
Spraggett wore eau-de-nil satin, and her
daughter Anne a bouffant gown of white
tulle. Betty Everard’s lime-green chiffon
gown had cherry-red velvet ribbons. A
slim white crepe gown, heavily gold-
beaded, was worn by Mrs. Alan Powell.
Mrs. Charles Burge’s crimson velvet was
banded with white ermine. Bronze
moire-faille was the choice of Mrs. R.
Ives. Mrs. R. Austin’s gold lame gown
was covered with midnight-blue tulle.
Mrs. Damien Miller’s frock of parma-
violet tulle had a strapless bodice. Mrs.
Stewart Legge wore grey floral-printed
chiffon and Nan Heath pale-lilac lace.
The turf and its appurtenances formed
the decoration-motif at the Derby Eve
Ball at Earl’s Court organised by
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
Association. Jeanette Brooks was one of
a small party ; her full-skirted frock was
of aqua-and-white-striped organza. Lady
Gullett, president of the association, chose
a gown of black chiffon embellished with
jet trimmings on the shoulders. Mrs. lan
Miller, president of the ball-committee,
wore black silk jersey. Very effective was
the mink halter-neckline on the chartreuse
satin gown worn by Mrs. Trevor Clarke.
Crimson faille was the choice of Mrs. J.
Cramer Roberts. A slim sheath of
American Beauty crepe was worn by
Mrs. Trevor Oldham. Mrs. Tom Fogarty's
seagull-grey tulle was beaded.
From Sydney
The Bulletin table won a prize for
originality at the Artists’ Ball, and well
it might, decorated as it was with posters
by artists Norman Hetherington, Les
Such, Sid Black, Carol Martin, lohn
Andrews, Ray Whiting and Ron Broadley.
The place-cards were joke-blocks drawn
specially by Unk White and Ron Broad-
ley, and a mock Bulletin poster de-
manded that Dulcie Deamer should be
made Prime Minister. Dulcie herself was
at the party, once more clad in a leopard-
skin and every inch a cavewoman. Harley
Matthews travelled from his vineyard,
at Ingleburn, dressed as the stockrider
from A. L. Gordon. Short-story writers
Margaret Trist, M. G. Vincent, Ken Levis
and Alf Headley were there —also poet
Roland Robinson. The lon Idriess family
turned out in full force and book-
collectors were represented by Walter
Stone and his fiancee, Jean Saxelby, of the
Public Library. Dr. Sheila Drescher,
who is to be married on Saturday to
Mr. John Keenan, was at the ball with
her two bridesmaids, sister Joan and
Cecilia Doolan.
It was a nice party that the Rubber
Development Board gave for English
road-expert Smee, here to discuss the
merits of rubber-and-bitumen roads. How
the party gets into the Woman’s Letter
is rather a puzzle, for there were no
women present and, as Mr. Smee himself
said, “I can’t imagine anything less
womanly than a road-surface.”
This is Mrs. John Rowe, whose
marriage took place recently at St.
Mark’s, Darling Point. Mrs. Rowe was
formerly Jan Urquhart, daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. A. M. Urquhart, of Oatley.
Her husband is the son of the late Mr.
L. M. Rowe and Mrs. May Rowe, of
Yamma Tree Station, Bethungra, and
Melbourne. Mr. and Mrs. Rowe left on
the Orantes for Colombo and expect to
be away about five weeks. Photo by
Hugh Spencer.
A thermometer at 95 didn’t prevent
the Garden Club from journeying up to
the mountains for the day on Saturday
and taking in the rhododendron-decked
garden of Edelweiss at Kurrajong, on the
way. T. R. Raine, who owns Edelweiss,
is an expert on rhododendrons and has
journeyed to the far north (up Cairns
way) in search of specimens. He says
that although the rhododendron (and the
azalea, which is one of its series) is a
native of Asia, coming from the regions
of Tibet, he has found a native Australian
species at Cairns. At Mount Wilson
several gardens were visited, including
Fred Mann’s stately garden, which sur-
rounds an enchanting stone house built
around a courtyard so that the sunlight
filters all through the house. The garden
is dominated by trees and lawns, with
lovely flower-surprises everywhere, lilies-
of-the-valley, for instance, and wisteria
that is white or pink as well as mauve.
The party given by the Australian-
American Association during the week
was very animated. The guests were
Evelyn Laye and Frank Lawton, Mrs.
C. R. McKerihan and Carrie Moore,
charming and warmhearted as ever. Two
Florence Taylors took the floor, one to
sing, the other to preside, and Minnie
Love delighted everyone with her enter-
taining. Mrs. M. A. Moran, from Narro-
mine, brought with her Mrs. M. Samms,
and guests from America included Miss
Block and Miss Mannester.
The “Hansel and Gretel” opera season
which is to be given at the Conserva-
torium in January should have an appeal
for nearly everyone in search of enter-
tainment. The artists are June Bronhill,
Phyllis Rogers, Betty Prentice, Pamela
Marks, Valerie Isbister and Joy Denistone.
The one man in the company is Alan
Light. The season is being arranged by
a committee, of which Lady Anderson
is the president, in aid of the N.S.W.
Homes for Incurables’ Extension Appeal.
Mr. Edward Rayne, chairman of the
firm which makes shoes for the Queen
and Princesses, was in Sydney during the
week, but etiquette forbade his giving any
inside information about the Royal
family’s shoe-buying habits. He seemed
to know all about the coming fashions
in shoes, which feature principally ex-
periments in the use of fabrics, tweeds,
linen, moire with diamente eyelets, etc.
Mr. Rayne’s get-up for cocktail wear was
noteworthy—a very dark navy broadcloth
suit, the coat cut long with a deep vent at
centre back, a fine lawn shirt with a
monogram over the heart, a grey tie with
pearl pin and a red carnation. To meet
Mr. Rayne at a cocktail-party at Prince’s
were members of the Press and the shoe
trade. Society was represented by Mrs.
Graham Body in navy duster and small
citron hat, English visitor the Countess
of Hardwicke, Mrs. Bill Kendall, Mr. and
Mrs, B. L. Cannon and Mrs. J. Bendrodt.
Peggy Bendrodt’s cotton dress was quite
something to admire. The reds and
creams of the intricate small pattern were
given a Midas-touch here and there with
tiny patches of gold—all hand-done by
natives in Hawaii, where she bought it.
It was worn with a black hat so broad
and drooping it would have been a tent
had it tried a bit harder. In Hawaii, said
Mrs. Bendrodt, hats are not worn, except
for “lovely mad beach ones,” some
waving foot-long palm-stalks with
monkeys and the like dangling at the end
of them. They would make a sensation
at Palm Beach, but lack of dollars and
the general weirdness of the hats brought
commonsense to the fore, so that’s one
bit of fun we’ve missed.
Entertainment for the Glory boys is
being doled out in a slow and meagre-
handed way by Sydney people, especially
for the ratings and petty-officers. Those
who really want to do something to show
gratitude for the work these English boys
have done in Korea can offer hospitality
from November 7 to 21 and from
November 22 to December 22. Lady
Anderson and her committee are particu-
larly anxious to arrange country visits for
these boys during their periods of leave.
When you work in the fashion world
you never know what season of the year
it is really. During last week’s heat this
Letter saw models plying their much-
envied trade clad in overcoats, woollen
dresses and suits. During the depths of
winter they shiver in bathing-suits. Manu-
facturers have mostly finished their winter
goods now and are beginning to think
about what they will show for spring.
The wonder is that the designers can get
any spirit into the thing when they have
to work at warm things in summer and
cool things in winter. Maybe they should
get into Turkish baths to design beach
clothes and ice-houses for overcoats.
Jean Garling writes from the Jacaranda
Festival at Grafton, where she is studying
the folk-dances: “You should have seen
the people (a thousand or more)' of all
ages, joining hands, all inhibitions cast
aside, and dancing the various folk-
dances which are part of the festival.
The youngest in my ring was three, the
oldest about 70. Mrs. Leith Charleston
composed the Jacaranda Folk Dance four
years ago—words, music and steps. Since
then it has been accepted by Folk Lore
authorities as Australia’s first folk-dance.
The latest addition here is Vockler’s
Minuet, also arranged by Mrs. Charleston,
of Grafton, in honor of Mr. Vockler,
who planted the first avenue of trees.
There are lavish things to buy this
Christmas, as the Gift Hall in David
Jones’s demonstrates. Musical-boxes
promise to provide the signature tune of
of the year —they come disguised in all
shapes, but the most delightful is a bird
in a gilded cage which is also a lamp.
The gifts shown are mostly from Europe,
and have that exquisitely-fine finish that
good craftsmanship gives. There seems,
however, to be little scope for the humble
gift-buyer such as this Letter, who goes
out in Christmas week with a list of 12
people and an allotment of 7s. 6d. for
each. During the war we wished there
were beautiful things to buy. Now we
wish we could buy the beautiful things
there are.

PERSONAL ITEMS
It’s only a guess (the gentleman being
reticent on the subject), but Sir Ernest
Fisk might be heading back to Australia
to have a shot at doing for the country’s
television what he managed for its wire-
less. Anyway, he is leaving the headship
of the vast H.M.V, organisation in
Middlesex, England. In every way a
remarkable man, a scientist with none of
the absent-mindedness and exclusiveness
attributed to the breed. Sir Ernest was a
crack motor-driver, is well-informed on
general affairs, and owns a keen business
brain. He has been in wireless almost
since he discarded triangular trousers. At
20 he joined the Marconi Co., and in
1910 came to Australia to crystallise the
efforts of a small inspired group (The
Bulletin’s Macleod among them) into
Amalgamated Wireless A/sia, Ltd. What
that infant grew into is history. Born at
Sunbury-on-Thames 65 years ago, Fisk
was a bosom friend of Marconi. He rose
Sir Ernest in 1937, when he was chief
of A.W.A.
About three years ago Sydneysider
John Alden launched his John Alden Co.
of Shakspearian players, with high hopes
and considerable class as an actor. He
has proved both —the other day the Firm
signed his players for a season of six
Shakspeares at Melbourne’s Comedy
Theatre, beginning next month. A pro-
duct of Manning River (N.S.W.), Alden
took his B.A. at Sydney University
and also a deal of Shakspeare from such
experts as Professors J. Le Gay Brereton
and Arthur Waldock. Joining the Sydney
Independent Theatre in 1932 (then housed
in the Savoy Theatre), Alden was up to
his ears in the stage by 1936, and headed
for England to act with Olivier and
Thorndike. In being taken on by the
Firm he parallels Borovansky, who built
up his ballet, as Alden has his players,
into a group of sufficient competence to
be taken under the wing of the Tails. The
ballet went on to become a national in-
stitution—here’s hoping the same for
Alden,
As on their glorious Anzac Day stand
in Korea this year, the Royals took upon
their competent shoulders a sizeable share
of the savage stoushing north of the Injin
River between the third and eighth of
last month, for his share in which the
D.S.O. went to the battalion’s commander,
Lieut.-Col. Frank Hassett. Well up in
front, Hassett (said the citation) showed
“complete disregard for his life.” The
Royals were heaviest-hit of any unit in
the Commonwealth Division —suffering
20 killed and 104 wounded. On the
delivery end they killed 283 Chinese and
took 50 prisoners.
Britain’s new Speaker:
The House of Commons made two departures
from precedent in electing a Speaker. Normally
the Deputy-Speaker steps up, but James Milner,
a Privy Councillor, a major and M.C. and Bar
of War 1, a solicitor and Labor member for
S.E. Leeds since 1929, had fallen foul of the
Privileges Committee, a stern and august body
in the Commons, over lire question of practising
his profession within the precincts of the House.
The name of Lloyd George’s son, who returned
to the House for Newcastle after having been
beaten in Pembroke last election by 129 votes,
was mentioned, but the choice fell on Major
John Granville Morrison, described as “a
bagpipe-playing Scot,” though one purified by
an English education —Eton and Magdalene
College, Cambridge, an institution once much
favored by missionaries, including Australia’s
Sam Marsden. Morrison is more than one up on
Archie Cameron of Canberra, who cannot play
the bagpipes and who, though he held a
Highlander commission, has never been, like
Morrison, a member of the Royal Company of
Archers —the King’s Bodyguard i'n Scotland.
Neither has he been M.F.H. of the Canberra
Fox and/or Rabbit and Bandicoot Hounds
(Gullett’s Own), as Morrison is of the South
and West Wilts Pack. Nor, again, has he
been High Sheriff of Barker, as Morrison has
been of Wiltshire. And, further, he is not
married, like Morrison, to the direct descendant
of W. H. Smith of railway-bookstall fame,
who, as First Lord of the Admiralty, provided
W. S. Gilbert with his prototype for Admiral
Porter, K.C.8., in Pinafore. On the other
hand, Morrison is an Argyllshire man from
Islay, in the land of the “false, fair Campbells,”
which puts all Camerons one up on him. He
is only 45, one of the youngest men and the
only Scot to sit in the Chair in modern times.
He served in the Middle East, 1939-42, with
the Royal Wilts Yeomanry.
Whether at Oxford, where he had part
of his book-learning; on Bougainville,
where he reported war; in the marble
halls of “5.M.H.,” where he was for a
time a director of the firm which his
family has held as its own for genera-
tions ; or riding a motor-bike through
the peak-hour traffic of Sydney’s George-
street —John Fairfax, dead too young at
47, was always John Fairfax. People
were his kindly interest; outside of people
the Bush, natural history and canoeing.
His writing of his rambles was charming
and old-world, but among newspapermen
who knew him he will be remembered
the more for his humanity in a sphere in
which humaneness is rare.
The Commonwealth could not have
made a worthier selection than Stannus
William Hedger, M.8.E., to be Aus-
tralia’s representative at the International
Conference of Educators of Blind Youth
to be held in Holland. Nobody has done
those afflicted ones better or longer
service. Director of the Royal Victorian
Institute for the Blind since 1920, he
worked up to that position from an
apprenticeship to the N.S.W, Institute,
which he entered from Fort-street in
1906, One of his important jobs is
marriage broker, for the institute in St.
Kilda-road gets many applications for
marital unions with blind people which
have to be very carefully considered.
Carnegie Corporation paid the expenses
of a world tour by air which enabled
Hedger to study work with the blind in
Canada, America and England in 1948 ;
in 1914 he represented this country at
an international conference in London.
Son of Henry J. Hedger, M.8.E.,
he was born in 1891 in Sydney.
Caught by Prior at Sydney’s Millions
Club, Chester Wilmot, in the middle of
a first-class speech on international affairs.
Wilmot speaks forcefully and concisely,
the trained historian with the trained
delivery; he’s had opportunity enough
to become proficient in both arts. Born
in Brighton (Vic.), 40 years ago, B.A.
and LL.B. from Melbourne University,
he showed his bent early, being selected
to lead the Australian Univerities’ debat-
ing team on its tour of the Far East,
North America and England just before
War II broke out. In 1940 he joined the
A.B.C. as war-correspondent, and through
ETHER WAVES.
his dispatches from Greece, Syria, Tobruk
and New Guinea became known in just
about every Australian home owning a
wireless-set. He widened his audience in
1944, reporting for the 8.8. C. the east-
ward struggle across Europe to Berlin.
Responsible for the Tobruk-Alamein
section of the Official War History,
Wilmot has already put between covers
a very good I-was-there account of the
Tobruk siege, and is now tidying-up his
self-explanatory Struggle For Europe.
He's here on holiday.
Herewith the purposeful facade which
houses the quietly competent personality
of Kenneth Stewart Colquhoun, captain of
R.N. carrier Glory. Drawn by Dubois
in his cabin under the tucked-in tail of
Glory’s flight-deck, Colquhoun hails from
Scotland, just missed Wilhelm’s war and
was on the China station in destroyers
before qualifying, in 1929, as a Fleet Air
Arm observer, in War II he was Com-
mander (Operations) in carrier Ark Royal
(John Eccles, lately F.O.C. Australian
Fleet, his executive officer), and was in
all the “sinkings” of the carrier except
the real one. Colquhoun was at Dakar
(with cruiser Australia), on those lively
CARRIER WAVES.
Malta convoys (flying-off fighters to wel-
come the Luftwaffe), and in 1943 crossed
to the U.S. to take over an escort-carrier,
one of those refitted merchantmen whose
main job was sooling destroyers on to
submerged subs, her aircraft couldn’t get
at themselves. His impressions of Korea
are the intensity of flying ops. there (with
not much air opposition and no sub-
marine threat, Glory’s aircraft hardly had
their wheels down); and the coming into
its own, among stratosphere bombers and
jet fighters, of the homely helicopter.
Glory’s own whirligig has picked up shot-
down crews behind enemy lines, from a
sandbank and (when a landing plane
finished in the drink) fished a pilot from
sea to flight-deck in about three minutes.
Over a fathom long, Colquhoun off the
bridge loves flowers, fills his cabin with
’em, and while c.o. of a large U.K. air-
station planted thousands of pine-trees.
His cabin sports a grimmer trophy—the
original surrender document, signed by
Lt.-General Sturdee aboard Glory, cover-
ing Jap forces in New Guinea, New
Britain and Bougainville.
“Trinco”: Included in Churchill’s Cabinet
are two names hardly known to the politically-
conscious public—Lord Ismay and Lord Cher-
well. Yet both men were as close to Churchill
in the war years as his Parliamentary colleagues.
General Ismay, as he was then, was Churchill’s
head military adviser for the whole of the war,
and accompanied him on most of his missions
abroad. Churchill records in his memoirs that
his “debt to Ismay is immeasurable when
the going was toughest, he remained calmest.”
Lord Cherwell was Professor Lindemann when
Hiller let go, and had been Churchill’s trusted
friend and confidant for 20 years. He had two
qualifications of vital consequence to Churchill
—he had helped him try to sound the tocsin
of German military aggression, and was in
complete accord with his superior about the
imminent danger of the threat; and he had the
ability (imperative at a time when, to those
behind the scenes, it was obvious that the war
would be waged with mounting scientific horror)
of being able to decipher the involved reports
from the experts and explain to Churchill in
lucid language what was coming, so that deci-
sions could be made to meet it. It was Linde-
mann who reported to Churchill that the Ger-
mans had invented a radio-beam which would
guide and allow the Luftwaffe to bomb by night
and in the thickest fog. Lindemann also told
him that there was a way of bending the beams
if they acted. Churchill, apprised of the danger
in terms he could appreciate, acted —and a good
tonnage of German h.e. exploded harmlessly on
English fields. An experimental pilot himselt,
and one-time director of the R.A.F.’s research
laboratories at Farnborough, Lord Cherwell is
now Paymaster-General, a post he held for the
last three years of War 11. Ismay has charge
of Commonwealth Relations.
Calling it a day from Deputy High
Commissioning for the U.K. in Australia,
Waiter Garnett has had a long and well-
liked association with Australia, begin-
ning with his appointment as assistant
British Government representative here
20 years ago. He’s been in Canberra
since (with a break in Wellington, N.Z.),
rising to the secretaryship of the H.C.’s
office in 1944. An 0.8. E. came his way
in 1941, and C.M.G. in 1950. Relieving
him, Ben Cockram, also C.M.G. and
0.8. E., has had equally long Dominions-
diplomatic experience. Entering the
Dominions office in 1926, Cockram was
secretary to the U.K. High Commissioner
in S. Africa for the first four years of War
11, and crossed to Washington as coun-
sellor to the British Ambassador in 1944.
From then on he’d been advisorily con-
nected with U.N.O. and U.N.R.R.A.,
attending the ’Frisco Conference in 1945
and the Peace Conference in Paris the
following year. A Jersey Islander, 48, he
comes to Canberra from a departmental
headship in the Commonwealth Relations
Office in London.
In Australia from London on banking
business (and with a hopeful ear cocked
for anything sounding like a Churchillian
denationalisation of steel), Colonel Arthur
Terence Maxwell was chairman of the
Union Bank of Australia before it merged
with the Bank of Australasia recently,
and is now a director of the marriage.
On the steel side he’s among the Vickers
hierarchy, as well as that of the Steel
Co. of Wales. A governor of Rugby (old
school), the visitor led the Ministry of
Economic Warfare’s mission to the
Middle East at the height of the ructions
there in War 11, and, on the soldiering
side, was a staff-colonel at Army Field
Headquarters in 1943-44. Still well under
50, he had for father a distinguished War
I British Army general (also a director of
the Union Bank, with D.S.O. and Bar
and five “mentions”), and for father-in-
law Austen Chamberlain.
Dr. C. J. Birkett Clews, a man whose
rocket experience certainly won’t go
amiss these times, succeeds Professor
A. D. Ross in the Chair of Physics at
Westralia’s University. Thirty-nine, the
new man is at present Principal Scientific
Officer at the National Research
Laboratory of the U.K. In the Hitler
disturbance he was one of the team of
scientists attached to the British Ministry
of Supply. Among the many research
investigations he made were experiments
in visual and acoustic methods of spot-
ting long-range rocket-launching sites —
Bomber Command completing the
experiments.
Into the Silence:
At Auckland (N.Z.), at 64, Gordon Leith
Stanbrook, well-known journalist who entered
the Inky Way in 1909 on the Thames “Star”
and held jobs later on the Fiji “Times” and
U.S. papers. After a shot at planting and
trading in the Islands he returned to the N.Z.
"Herald,” becoming chief-reporter thereon. He
was one-time president and secretary of the
N.Z. Journalists’ Association.
In Dunedin (N.Z.), at 61, Thomas Oakley
Brebner, who joined the Customs Department
in 1906, became assistant-representative in
London 20 years later, he was appointed N.Z.
representative in New York in 1939, and the first
Consul-General when the consulate was opened
there in 1945. On a consulate being opened in
San Francisco in 1949 he shifted there to fill
a like office. He’d been in ’Frisco earlier —
among the N.Z. delegation at the U.N. con-
ferences in 1946 and 1947.
In Newcastle (N.S.W.), Dr. May Harris,
member of a well-known medical family in the
district. Her father, Dr. John Harris, was for
years medical adviser to the northern colliery
proprietors; she succeeded him, to make tor
herself, in her 20-odd years’ work on the pre-
vention and treatment of industrial diseases, an
international reputation. She supervised, as
well, an anti-T.B. clinic in Newcastle. All of
her five brothers became medicoes.
In Melbourne, at 63, Dr. Lewis Nott, who
in the 1949 changeover became Canberra’s first
M.P. He had been superintendent of the
Community Hospital there for years, but had
also had a previous term in the Representatives
—some 25 years ago, when he achieved a
measure of fame by shifting Theodore from his
almost unassailable Labor seat of Herbert.
Born at Bundaberg (Q.), Dr. Nott had been
Mayor of Mackay ip 1923-26, and before that
had held important medical posts in the U.K.
In War I he was a private in a Scottish cavalry
regiment, rising to adjutant. Defeated in the
last election, he was on his way to superintend
Yalloum hospital when the end came.

A MATTER OF
PRINCIPLE
by JAMES PRESTON
THE three boys, sheltering in
the sparse shade of a rugged
gum beside the road, moved
restlessly as the hot breeze
sent the sweat trickling down
their backs.
The three boys wore shorts
and were barefooted. The
eldest, Clive, wore his towel
wound like a turban about his
head and carried a pair of
swimming-togs in his hand.
Jackie, short, tubby and red-
faced, carried his towel and togs
wrapped in a bundle, while Ron
carried both towel and togs
loosely in his hand.
“Here he comes now,” Ron
said, and the boys climbed to
their feet and looked towards
the township.
“You’d think he had all
bloomin’ day,” Jackie said, jut-
ting out his bottom lip.
“Got his dog, too.”
“Ah, that tyke follows Billy
everywhere.”
“Bit of a mong, isn’t it?”
BILLY came trotting along
the side of the road, his
towel wrapped about his head
and his togs stuffed into the
pocket of his shorts. He, too,
was barefooted.
“About time you turned up,
Clive told him. “We wasn’t
goin’ to wait much longer.”
“Gosh, it’s hot,” Billy said.
“Why’d you bring the tyke?”
Jackie wanted to know.
Billy turned and looked at his
dog. It looked back at him, its
wide, mongrel eyes deep-blue
pools, one ear cocked.
“I dunno,” Billy said. “Get
home, Tige. Go on. Get,” he
said. Tige lowered his ear, put
his tail between his legs, walked
a few paces away and sat down.
“Aw, leave him alone. He
can look after our clothes,”
Clive said.
Jackie looked up at Clive
admiringly, and Clive, catching
the glance, put his chest out and
dug one big toe into the dirt.
“He’s a good watchdog,” Billy
told them. “Here, Tige.”
The dog slouched across to
him and submitted to being
patted on the head. Then it sat
down and idly scratched behind
one ear with its hind paw.
“Gosh,” Jackie said softly.
“He’s got fleas.”
The four lads glanced down
at the dog. Tige went on
scratching unconcernedly, screw-
ing up his face in an effort to
get at the source of irritation.
“Phenyle’s good for fleas,”
Ron said.
Billy put his hands on his hips
and faced him “All dogs
scratch,” he said. “That doesn’t
mean he’s got fleas.”
u WY old man says that fleas
IVI breed in the dirt,” Clive
said, putting his head wisely to
one side.
“Gee,” Jackie breathed. “In
dirt!”
“He’s got ’em bad,” Clive
said.
Billy bent over the dog and
parted the black hair near the
neck. The dog stopped its
scratching and tried to lick his
hand. He pushed its head away
impatiently and had a look
behind its ears.
“Aw, nuts,” he said. “He’s
got no fleas.”
“Why’s he scratchin’ then?”
Jackie asked, glancing at Clive
for encouragement.
“ ’Course he’s got ’em, bad,”
Clive announced.
“Look,” Billy said heatedly.
“You can say what you like, but
there’s no fleas on Tige, see.”
“What about this swim?” Ron
asked in his soft voice.
“He’s crawlin’ with ’em,”
Jackie cried, bending close to the
puzzled Tige.
Billy clamped his lips to-
gether and faced Jackie. “If you
say that again I’ll crown you,
Jackie,” he said.
“Yeh,” Clive said. “I said
he’s got fleas, too.”
“I’m tellin’ you, Clive; I’ll
crown the next one that says
Tige’s got fleas.”
“Yeh. You and what army?”
Clive scoffed.
Billy dragged his towel from
his head and threw it on the
dusty ground.
“Just me.”
“Ar, you couldn’t fight your
way out of a paper-bag.”
“No? You try me. Go on.
You try me.”
“I’ll more than try you if you
talk to me like that.”
“Well, go on ; hit me.”
“So you can tell your old
man, eh?”
Billy clenched his fists and
pushed Clive with his shoulder.
Clive moved back a step and
put his hands up.
“Say that agin,” Billy said.
“Yow,” Jackie called urgently.
“Here’s old Murphy.”
FOR all its isolation, the
township boasted a police
constable and one large,
rambling hotel. Cursing his luck
in having to push a heavy State
Government bicycle about on a
hot day like this, the police
force labored his way back to-
wards the township—and a cool
drink. He stopped peddling
when he saw the four boys and
the creaking bike wobbled to a
stop.
“What’s going on here?” he
demanded, sternly eyeing the
two fighters.
“We were only goin’ for a
swim, Mr. Murphy,” Ron said.
Murphy grunted. “Well, come
on. What’s the trouble?”
Clivt looked at Billy, and
Billy pouted his lower-lip and
glared at Clive.
“Clive here says that Tige’s
got fleas,” he said.
“He has, too,” Jackie put in
excitedly. “They’re crawlin’ all
over him, thousands and
thousands ...”
He broke off as he caught the
constable eyeing him.
“He hasn’t,” Billy protested.
“I bath him in phenyle and that
kills all the fleas.”

SUNDRY SHOWS
Hercules Brabazon.
Some delightful little water-
colors by Hercules Brabazon,
from the collection of Mr.
Norman Schureck, have been
showing at the N. S. Wales
National Gallery.
Brabazon, though his resound-
ing name alone should make him
memorable, probably isn’t nearly
as well-known in Australia as he
should be. He was a contem-
porary of Turner; travelled in
Egypt and on the Continent,
sketching as he went; and,
liking to think of himself as an
English gentleman rather than
an artist —but are the professions
really incompatible?—refused to
exhibit his paintings until his
70th year; after which, since he
had an instantaneous success, he
forgot about being a gentleman
and exhibited regularly until his
death in 1906.
He was born in Ireland, the
younger son of Hercules Sharp,
and took the name of Brabazon
when he succeeded his elder
brother in the Brabazon estates,
County Mayo.
Cox and Peter de Wint influ-
enced his early paintings. Turner
some of his later ; but he de-
veloped a style of his own, with
a free use bf body color, and
the 20 or so paintings at the
National Gallery, which Mr.
Schureck picked up on a recent
trip to England, are in this most
characteristic vein: none of the
Turner mistiness but, along with
rather loose drawing, beautifully
clear and vivid color.
Contemporary Group.
It would seem, from the
current exhibition at the Educa-
tion Department Galleries,
Sydney, that the days have past
since one could go along to a
Contemporary Art Society show
with the pleasant anticipation of
being excited, assaulted or
infuriated. The present show, in
its entirety, has none of that
atmosphere of feverish bustle,
of search and experiment, none
of that cheerful, insistent
Here we go in a flung festoon,
Half-way up to the jealous moon!
that practically demanded atten-
tion. It gives, rather, the impres-
sion of a hundred and more
artists laboriously flogging
sundry dead horses, and not
very enthusiastically at that.
There are heavy groups, dull
colors, brilliant colors, dutifully
grotesque patterns, and deliber-
ately messy painting variously
expended on such things as
“The People,” “Portrait of
Christ,” “Woman Pursued by
Eagle in Front of House,”
“Flowers I Grew in May,”
“Post Atom,” “Citizen on
Atlantis” and so forth.
Francis Lymburner’s “Lute
Players” and “Two Dancers”
are, in an apparent attempt at
gaiety, dull and smeary; and
Maximilian Feurring’s “The
Steak” is heavy and uninterest-
ing, even at the present price
of meat.
In the general heaviness,
Ronald Steuart’s “Stone and
Piece of Drift Wood” and
“Dying Rose” are lightly pleas-
ing—there is a real sense of
experiment in the graceful
exploration of fine line and soft
color —and Lilian Chauvel seems
to have achieved her intended
effect in the cheerful, bursting
color of “Carnival.” George
Duncan has two typical, soft
George Duncans, Ruth Tuck’s
“Victor Harbor” is lively, and
Mervyn Ashmore Smith’s two
South Australian scenes are
surprising only in that such
conventionally - pleasant items
found their way into such
strange company.
In the sculpture section, I. E.
Villiers has a “Girl with
Pigeon” and a “Girl with Cat,”
which may be distinguished from
each other by the numbers in
the catalogue ; Anita Aarons has
three conventional “funda-
mentals” in “Figure,” “Form
and Rhythm” and “Giraffe,” and
something more expressive in a
head, “Susan Cohen”; while
Lucian Michalski’s “Head of
Albert Namatjira” may be added
to the long list of injustices per-
petrated on the Australian
aboriginals.
In the architectural depart-
ment there are a batch of “basic
design forms” by Josef Albers
which look rather like geometric
doodling, and a group of photo-
graphs and plans of houses
which illustrate at least one
branch of “contemporary” art
which is alive, growing and
useful.
Tate Adams, an Irish artist
who is showing oils at the
Stanley Coe Galleries, Mel-
bourne, and who seems to have
painted in India as well as the
green island, appears to paint in
a sort of Celtic twilight where
nothing is and everything seems.
The tone and color seem to be
there, but the forms are only
guessed at. A couple of dabs
of color in a sombre expanse of
shifting shadow are “Nuns in a
Forest,” and “Two Priests,”
presumably Buddhist, are similar
dabs of a different color in what
is presumably an Indian jungle.
In “Hindu God” an elephant’s
trunk seems to be recognisable,
so apparently Ganesha is de-
picted, but “Quarry in Mourne”
and “Rocky Beach” are evi-
dently nowhere. Art is a parti-
cular thing, and there is some-
thing vaguely unsatisfying about
Mr. Adams’s generalised
approach to different aspects of
nature though his color is often
pleasant.
Bianca Mascolo.
Between her first recital given
some two years ago in Sydney
and the farewell concert she gave
at the Con. on Saturday night
before going overseas, Madame
Mascolo’s singing has taken on
a polish and acquired interpreta-
tive strength of a notable order.
Moreover, she can be depended
upon to give interesting songs.
As well as two of Schubert’s
most engaging creations, of
which “To be Sung on the
Waters,” with its lovely rippling
accompaniment, was beautifully
delivered, there was Gustav
Mahler’s splendid “Sermon to
the Fishes,” a song too rarely
heard.
Poulenc’s miniature song-cycle
“Le Bestiaire,” six fanciful frag-
ments of much greater wit than
melodic charm, was given the
exact degree of naivete and
airiness it deserved. Si x
Portuguese folksongs by Da'vico
hadn’t much to them, but in
ranging all over Italy for speci-
mens of her native folksongs the
soprano unearthed a rich lode —
their moods, ranging from light-
hearted gaiety to full tragedy,
found her in her best vein. A
group of children’s songs by
Blech and Prokofieff was de-
lightful. The soprano joined
with Douglas Mitchell —a tenor
of considerable promise who
isn’t afraid to open his mouth
and who has a good “forward”
production in duets from
“A mico Fritz” and “La
Boheme.” These were sung
spiritedly and with a nice blend-
ing of tonal shades. As well as
accompanying discreetly Daniel
Koletz played solos, of which a
Chopin group and Liszt’s “Con-
solation” were the most
artistically satisfying.
Queensland is no exception to
the finding (B. 24/10/’5l) that
much of the best work done by
State Symphony Orchestras can
be attributed to resident con-
ductors. John Farnsworth Hall
has for a long time realised the
capacities and limitations of his
smallish orchestra, and his latest
programme may well be con-
sidered one of the most satisfy-
ing of the present season. He
chose the Samuel Barber
“Adagio for String Orchestra”
with absolute faith in the powers
of merely a section of his
orchestra to create a massive
tone, and after interval con-
ducted a wonderful version of
so complex and colored a work
as “Scheherazade.” For years
now the resident conductor’s
choice of programme material
has been courageous, and quite
often the most interesting items
of the concert season have been
evoked by his baton. Audrey
White, winner of the Concerto
Vocal Competition for 1951, was
soloist on this occasion in a per-
formance of Cesar Franck’s
Symphonic Variations which
needed more fire in the conclud-
ing section.
"Peep Show."
Roger Ray, in Melbourne
Tiv.’s current offering, is one of
the funniest comedy musicians
seen here in years ; while the
Pan Yue Jen troupe of Oriental
equilibrists are also the best of
their kind in a long time, the
leader a giant who carries the
lot on his body—there are
about 14 of them. Alexander
does almost as well with his
solitary partner Rosita by carry-
ing her on the biceps of one
arm.
Donald Novis, the Voice that
is Charming Millions, didn’t
charm the present commentator
—he shifts his register suddenly
to a falsetto which tears at the
eardrums, a pressure which, no
doubt, transfers itself to the
heart-strings of the susceptible.
Wally Boag is an amusing
introducer and Violette an
engaging dancer. Marquis and
his family do some remarkable
things—though monkeys doing
things like men aren’t half as
interesting as monkey-like men
doing things like monkeys.
"Winter Sunshine."
The action of Geoffrey
Thomas’s “Winter Sunshine,”
put on by the Sydney Drama
Society, takes place on the
promenade deck of a Royal Mail
steamer bound from London for
Australia.
The happenings during the
voyage revolve around Sophie
Lucas (Dinah Goodman), an
attractive matron who spends
her time travelling backwards
and forwards on the same ship,
knitting and solving other
people’s troubles. Between
somewhere in the Red Sea and

Brisbane Twelfth Night
Theatre ended its official season
—“Dream Girl,” “Antigone”
and “The Eagle Has Two
Heads” —with John Digh ton’s
“The Happiest Days of Your
Life.” The author often holds
up his situations by punning and
obvious crudity, but the plot is
basically a funny one, the bulk
of the amusement arising from
the double-booking of a boys’
and a girls’ school into the one
set of buildings and the clashes
between principals, staffs and
students of the two schools,
Harold Cox, as Mr, Pond, prin-
cipal of Hilary Hall, managed to
achieve the right degree of
farcical comedy, but Vi Hughes,
mistress of the girls’ school, was
too severe and not preposterous
enough. Production by Eunice
Hanger could have been taken
faster, even if it meant using
the scissors on the dull patches
of the script.

ADDITIONS
CHURCHILLISMS.
“New York Times” puts in a
couple of sentences what most,
no doubt, expect of Mr.
Churchill as once again British
Prime Minister;
“Once more he will make his-
tory—not only make, but go
after it, create it, mould it. With
Winston Churchill at the helm
a ship ventures into new and
brave seas.”
It is an easily recognisable
picture—the Churchill of the
war. But in his speeches indi-
cating the lines of policy now to
be expected of his Government
the note has been that of the
doggedly determined rather than
the adventurous Churchill. He
has, however, clearly enough
indicated the lines on which his
Government will move, as the
following few extracts show;
“We need a period of several
years of solid, stable administra-
tion by a Government not seek-
ing to rub party dogmas into
everybody else. It will take us
all we can do to keep going at
home and play our part, which
is a great one, in maintaining
the freedom and peace of the
world.”
“Nationalisation is now ad-
mitted to have been a failure. It
has been very costly to the pub-
lic. It has given a poorer ser-
vice to the user or consumer
and except perhaps in the coal-
mines, and not in all of the coal-
mines, it is not popular among
the employees. This ill-starred
experiment has caused immense
injury both to our harassed
finances and our creative
energy.”
“The keeping on of the war-
time controls and restrictions
has hampered our recovery,
fettered our enterprise and
enormously added to the cost
and apparatus of government
.... .The fewer [controls and
restrictions] we have the better
for a vigorous and expanding
Britain.”
“What are we rearming for?
It is to prevent Communist
Russia, its reluctant satellites and
its ardent votaries spread about
in many countries —some of
them even here—from beating
us all down to their dead-level
as they have done, as much as
they can, to the people of every
country they have occupied
during and since the war. But
rearmament is only half a
policy. Unless you are armed
and strong you cannot expect
any mercy from the Com-
munists ; but if you are armed
and strong you may make a bar-
gain with them which might rid
the world of the terror in which
it now lies and relieve us all
from much of the impoverish-
ment and privations into which
we shall otherwise certainly
sink.”
“The gigantic rearmament of
the United States, their develop-
ment of the atom-bomb, the
growth of British and of Euro-
pean defence, and the unities
which have sprung into being
among the free democracies, in-
cluding our old enemies in the
war, give a foundation, ever
growing in strength and solidity,
upon which a fruitful and dur-
able peace settlement might yet
be made.”
“How is it that we, who have
given away and sacrificed more
than any other country to the
cry of anti-imperialism, should
also be the most hated in regions
where we have made the very
largest possible sacrifices and
concessions? Britain, the greatest
donor, who under Socialism has
given everything away in all
directions, except in Malaya, is
the one who is denounced as the
arch tyrant and reactionary. It
is an astonishing episode in
world history."
“A great country like ours
cannot escape from danger of
war and violence by running
away from them. It is a grievous
misfortune to the whole of the
Western allies in Europe or in
the Atlantic Pact when Britain
falls flat on her face as if she
were a booby. But this is not
the real Britain, it is only the
grimace of an exhausted and
divided administration.”
“Too much harm has been
done in these past six years for
it to be repaired in a few
months. Too much money has
been spent for us to be able to
avoid another financial crisis. It
will take all our national
strength to stop the downhill
slide and get us back on the
level, and after that we shall
have to work up.”
“We do not promise to create
a paradise—not even a fool’s
paradise. We are seeking to
build a lighthouse rather than to
dress a shop-window.”
“The desire of mankind in
this tragic 20th-century can be
seen and felt. The human race
is going through tormenting con-
vulsions, and there is a profound
longing for some breathing
space, for some pause in the
frenzy. That is true all over the
world. All the people in all the
lands long for a breathing space,
to be let alone.”
“If we can stave off a war
conflict for even five or 10 years
all sorts of things may happen.
A new breeze may blow upon
the troubled world. I repudiate
the idea that a third world war
is inevitable. The main reason
I remain in public life is my
hope to ward it off and prevent
it.”
The £ in Inflation.
Change of Government in
Britain has naturally led to
speculation on possible changes
in the rate of the £.
On this theme the Professor
of International Economics at
the Royal Institute of Interna-
tional Affairs, R. G. Hawtrey, in
an article in London “Fort-
nightly” contends that if infla-
tion is to be limited an essential
condition will be the selection of
a rate of exchange consistent
with that purpose, and that “Un-
doubtedly the rate in the first
instance must he raised.”
It was never pretended, he
points out, that the rate of
$2.80 adopted in September,
1949, for the £stg corresponded
te comparative costs in Great
Britain and the United States at
the time, and though since then
wages have been rising some-
what faster in Great Britain
than in the United States, the
rise has not been by so much as
to make the rate of $2.80
economic.
Adding that if the rate stands,
the rise of wages will have a
New York “Herald Tribune."
“DO YOU WANT ME TO GO BACK AND STALL
A BIT LONGER?”
long way further to go, he faces
the question: Can Britain afford
to raise the rate? He answers:
Certainly it can:
“For one disastrous effect of
the undervaluation of the pound
is that British exports are being
sold too cheap. A greater effort
is put into the export drive, but
the effort is largely spent in
increasing the volume of exports,
without any equivalent return in
the proceeds of their sale. In
any case the rise of wages is
rapidly destroying the competi-
tive advantage which devaluation
gave the exporters.
“But the selection of a suitable
rate of exchange at the present
time is only a starting-point. So
long as alternations of inflation
and deflation prevail in the
United States, a fixed dollar
equivalent of the pound will
transmit inflation and deflation
to Great Britain. If we acquiesce
in the inflation, and seek escape
from deflation from time to time
in further devaluation, we destine
the pound to an indefinite
degradation. If on the other
hand the rate of exchange is
raised when the flow of money
expands in the United States, it
can be lowered when the
reaction sets in, and the value
of the pound in goods held
stable.
“Would that mean surrender-
ing the advantages of stable rates
G f exchange? Far from it, for
a stable pound would be better
qualified to play its part as an
international currency to which
other units could safely be linked
at fixed rates. The dollar itself
might be stabilised. American
policy is not altogether blind to
the need for counteracting infla-
tionary and .deflationary ten-
dencies. But its intervention is
limited to expedients and pallia-
tives, and there seems no
immediate prospect of anything
more systematic,
“Stabilisation of the pur-
chasing-power of a money unit
is probably unattainable without
a return to the traditional
methods of regulating credit.
And there are signs that opinion
is coming round to a revival of
bank-rate policy.”
Scuttled Empire.
In his recent electioneering
Attlee was driven to try to
defend the Socialists’ policy of
scuttle in foreign affairs gener-
ally and the more-or-less late
Empire in particular.
“The Conservatives,” he said,
“still talk about the Empire, but,
as Field-Marshal Smuts said,
the Empire really died with the
ending of the Boer War.”
It brought a crushing correc-
tion from a “Times” letter-
writer :
“Field-Marshal Smuts said
nothing of the kind. Speaking
at the conference of the United
Nations in New York in 1947
he said: ‘British imperialism is
dead and buried. It received its
death wound in the Boer War,
and today it is but a spook, a
mere scarecrow for frightening
those who do not know or will
not know. The contribution
which Britain and the British
Empire can make to world
betterment in the human
qualities of balance and modera-
tion, good sense, good humor
and fair play, moral purpose and
outlook is of a very special
character. They are worth more
than scores of divisions, and
without them divisions must
ultimately fail.’
“May I quote again from
Field-Marshal Smuts? In a
statement to the Press in London
during his last visit to England
in June, 1949, he was reported
by the ‘Times’ as saying that
strength of spirit, courage and
independence were the great
needs. Nothing was more
dangerous than to sit like a
mouse watching an oncoming
snake—paralysed and reduced to
a state of frustration. At the
end of the nineteenth century he
saw Britain in all her glory dur-
ing one of the great ages of the
world. He had returned now to
a different Britain. There was a
change of temper. The British
people were sitting down to it.
They had never done so before
and should not do so now.
Nothing could be more futile
than to wait for destiny to work
its will. They should shake off
the spirit of pessimism and lassi-
tude. For the English there was
always a new beginning.”
Japs Watch Korea.
In the continuing comment on
the Japanese treaty, London
“Observer” has editorially
summed it up as “a great diplo-
matic success for the West and a
resounding diplomatic defeat for
Russia.”
Noting that the treaty
changes the balance of power in
the Far East beyond recognition,
it pinpoints Korea as the first
place where the effect of this
dramatic change will be felt;
“The vital interest of Japan
in Korea is as obvious as that
of Britain in the Low Countries.
It is unthinkable that a restored
Japan could tolerate the domina-
tion of Korea by either China
or Russia, and there is little
doubt that she will soon have
it in her power to prevent such
a domination.
“If Russia and China insist on
continuing the Korean war in-
definitely, it is now certain that
in the end they will collide with
Japan, who has defeated them
both in this part of the world in
modern times.
“The best that Russia and
China can now hope for in
Korea is to see Korea established
as a genuinely neutral and inde-
pendent buffer between them-
selves and Japan. This is still
possible under the terms of the
United Nations resolution of
October 7, 1950, which provides
for a united and independent
Korea, at first internationally
occupied and rehabilitated under
United Nations auspices. Its
independence might ultimately
be internationally guaranteed.
The Russians and Chinese have
hitherto defied and scorned that
United Nations resolution. They
will be wise to hurry in chang-
ing their attitude.”
Kashmir War Threat.
Dr. Graham, the latest U.N.O.
mediator in the quarrel, had to
admit failure to bring India and
Pakistan to agree on demili-
tarisation of Kashmir in pre-
paration for a plebiscite, but
(London “Times” has com-
mented) “so far from sharing
Sir Owen Dixon’s despairing
view that there is no hope that

the mediation of a third party
may produce agreement, he
thinks that the Security Coun-
cil can still give valuable help
in composing the quarrel.”
On this note U.N.O. now takes
up the issue at its Paris session.
And if it fails to break the dead-
lock, early war to decide is con-
sidered by British and U.S.
Press commentators only too
probable.
“It has become a settled con-
viction with many Indians and
Pakistanis,” a “Manchester
Guardian” correspondent has
reported, “that the differences
between their two countries will
ultimately have to be resolved
by resort to arms.”
The rest of the British Com-
monwealth, the correspondent
holds, can now do nothing
about it, and a U.N.O. settle-
ment seems, at best, a very poor
chance, while “Even the
moderates [in the country] say
that they cannot acquiesce in an
indefinite prolongation of the
present impasse. The recurring
crises of, the last two years
cannot be expected, in the nature
of things, always to pass away
peacefully.”
A London “Economist”
correspondent has commented:
“Mr. Nehru, the Indian Prime
Minister, is a man of peace, and
even in Pakistan he is generally
credited with a genuine hatred
of war and a desire to gain his
ends peacefully. But gain his
ends he must, at any rate where
Kasmir is concerned. He will
‘tolerate no nonsense’ in this
matter. If world opinion is
against him on this issue, we are
to believe that it is biased or
has been hoodwinked by
Pakistan’s clever presentation of
its case. Mr. Nehru reminds one
of the Irish juryman who was in
the minority of one—‘Eleven
more obstinate men I never saw
in my life.’ Certainly he does
not want war, but if his refusal
to follow the path of settlement
marked out by the Security
Council should lead to a con-
flagration, a very grave respon-
sibility will lie on his shoulders.”
The bloodshed, hatred and
violence that will occur if war
does break out are grimly in-
dicated by a sentence or two of
a recent London “Daily Tele-
graph” report: “The tragic mass
migration in the Punjab of
Hindus from Pakistan and
Moslems from India [on parti-
tion in 1947], involving millions
of men, women and children,
and the fanatical butchery which
accompanied these movements
of population raised barriers
between the two nations that
will not be entirely removed in
generations. In Karachi and
Delhi today almost one person
in three is a refugee.”
Supreme Peace Council.
In a London “Daily Tele-
graph” article, General Lord
Ismay (Chief-of-Staff to Mr.
Churchill as Minister of Defence
during the war) has strongly
urged the setting-up of a
supreme council of the heads of
Governments, similar to that of
the war days, but for the new
purpose of preserving peace.
Never, he insists, was a true
spirit of coalition more vital than
it is today, because in the so-
called cold war the potential
enemies have many advantages:
they are led by the same iron
hand ; there is no question of
divided counsels ; they are not
inhibited by scruples ; they have
no public opinion to consider.
Contending that the mere
piling-up of armaments, on how-
ever colossal a scale, will not of
itself provide a deterrent against
aggression, he suggests as indis-
pensable that the democracies
should have the means of think-
ing together and acting together
in all matters in which the in-
terests of any of their number
are threatened, and further, that
the enemy should know without
the shadow of doubt that they
are so aligned.
Hence, what is most urgently
required is some sort of supreme
council, with world-wide con-
spectus and world - wide
authority. “If a supreme court-
cil is necessary for the effective
prosecution of war, it is even
more necessary for its preven-
tion.”
Anthony Eden advocated very
much the same in a speech in
America. “The Communist
challenge,” he said, “is not only
a problem of Europe. It has
much wider range and signifi-
cance. We need not only an
Atlantic Pact admirably con-
structed to meet the immediate
problem of that area. The call
is for something much wider
and more general, for an overall
strategic concept which takes
account of the demands of
every front, estimates resources
and allocates them according to
need. I do not believe that the
existing machinery is adequate
for this purpose. Only when we
have such a concept fully worked
out, and the means prepared and
in place to meet these diverse
dangers, will the free world
really breathe again. This is an
immensely formidable task, but
we should not exaggerate it.”
Lighter Atomics.
As cabled, the most recent
U.S. atomic explosions were
evidently of the lighter type of
bomb, on which “New York
Times” military writer Hanson
W. Baldwin has commented:
“It would not be surprising if
United States atomic bombs
were now in Britain and aboard
one or more of the United States
aircraft-carriers.
“Instead of one plane,
numerous types can now carry
the atomic bomb, which has been
much lightened and simplified
since World War 11. Atomic-
bomb carrying types include the
Boeing B-29 and B-50 medium
bombers; the Convair B-36
heavy bomber ; the Boeing B-47
all-jet bomber; the North
American AJ-1, a Navy plane
designed for aircraft - carrier
operations ; the Lockheed P2V
Neptune patrol plane, a Navy
plane designed for use from land
bases, but which also has been
flown from carrier-decks.
“These facts indicate that
the United States atomic lead
oyer the Soviet Union is still
appreciable.”
U.S. Television.
A few facts and figures, re-
markable even for the U.S.,
recorded by a “Manchester
Guardian” correspondent:
Every week Americans buy
100,000 television sets.
More than two billion dollars
have been put into television by
industry and the public in the
past five years.
About 107 television stations
are now on the air in the United
States, and it is calculated that
about a third of the population
has daily access to a receiver.
The industry sets its 1951
target at about eight million sets.
A Word For U.N.O.
An old hand in world-league
matters, Australian Gilbert
Murray, in a London “Times”
letter, has listed “three hopeful
signs” in the “troubled progress”
of U.N.0.:
(1) The attempt to paralyse
the United Nations by the veto
in the Security Council has
definitely failed. Mr. Acheson’s
“uniting for peace” resolution
passed by the Assembly on
November 3, 1950, made that
clear.
(2) There is in the United
Nations what was lacking in
the League of Nations, a very
large and definite advantage in
membership. A share in
Marshall aid, in Mr. Truman’s
Fourth Point, in the Colombo
plan, and the very extensive pro-
grammes of mutual help between
nations is enough to make any
average nation, not subject to
special pressure, eager to play
its part in the United Nations,
as is shown by the immense
majorities for a United Nations
policy usual in the Assembly
(3) Experience in old League
days has shown that, as long as
war is prevented, repeated
failures to agree need not be
taken tragically. He recalls
more than one dispute of those
old League days in which,
though agreement was never
reached, the points of difference
grew smaller and smaller until
they were not worth the trouble
of further discussion.
Dragnet Digest.
Convicted. “New York Times”
staff correspondent in Germany:
“One inescapable fact in Europe,
which neither the rulers of Russia
nor their agents abroad seem to have
realised, is that, like Hitler in the
spring of 1939, no one really believes
the Russians any more.”
* * * *
Nice Compliment. “Christian
Science Monitor” records one for
Uncle Sam from an unexpected
quarter: “A Soviet spokesman at the
United Nations [A. A. Soldatov] has
borne gracious tribute to American
capitalism. The diplomat suggests
that the United States pay half the
yearly operating costs of the United
Nations because a study of compara-
tive incomes shows the American
economy best able to sustain this
loan. Shades of Marx, Lenin and all
the five-year plans to date! Where
is that post-war collapse of American
capitalism which follows inevitably
from orthodox Soviet doctrine?”
* * * *
Britain's Corns. —Lord Vansittart, in
a London “Daily Telegraph” letter:
“We [in Britain] need not ban the
‘Daily Worker’ or Communist meet-
ings at this stage of World War 111.
But we must be ready to do all that
in a day if the next Communist
thrust is in Europe, and even so we
shall be unable to cope with the
great number of enemy agents in this
country.”
* * * *
Unpopular Atomics. Consolation
of sorts offered by a “World Review”
writer: “The enormous destructive
powers of the atom-bomb make us
all condemn its use. But every time
in the past a new weapon has been
invented it has been indignantly
denounced. When Luther first saw a
cannon he is supposed to have said:
‘lf God had foreseen that man would
invent such weapons he would have
refrained from creating the world.’
Submarines on their first appearance
aroused the same horror and revul-
sion, but after a while they caused
no more discussion than any earlier
weapon.”
* * * *
U.N.O. Army. —Quoting an official
statement that so far 23 nations have
made favorable responses to the call
(a year ago) for a permanent U.N.O.
army to halt aggression, with “others
certain to join,” “New York Times”
states that the responses have come
from all major Western Powers,
including the U.S., Britain and
France, and from other free nations
in every continent: “They thus con-
stitute the beginning of a wider coali-
tion which already exceeds in the
number of participating nations both
the fourteen nations actually engaged
in Korea and the twelve nations
joined in the North Atlantic alliance.
That is a military and moral factor
which the Soviets cannot ignore.”
* * * *
Indo-China. “This bastion of
South-East Asia,” military writer
Hanson W. Baldwin calls it in “New
York Times”: “The importance of
the struggle in Indo-China is funda-
mental ; just as Korea is, in a sense,
a struggle for the approaches to
Japan and the north-eastern Pacific,
so Indo-China is a struggle for Thai-
land, Burma, Malaya and the south-
western Pacific.”
* * * *
Italy Doing Well. —Stating that
statistics could be marshalled to prove
that Italy has never been so well otf
as now, a staff correspondent in Rome
of “Manchester Guardian” mentions
as one illustration that, whereas in
1938 there were 715,000 unemployed
and 600,000 men in the Fascist militia
(who would otherwise have been
unemployed), today the unemployed
are about the same in number, though
the population has increased by four
millions since then, and 150,000
Italian “refugees” have come in from
Africa, Albania and Istria.
* * * *
In Lieu of Circuses. —“Ney York
Times” summing-up: “The Emperor,,
of Rome used bread and circuses to
divert their subjects’ minds from their
daily troubles; the Kremlin has gone
a long step farther and uses the
mirage of Communism to perform the
same function.”
* * * *
Quakers in Moscow. From a
report in the British Quaker weekly
“Friend” by the mission of seven
members of the Society of Friends
who lately visited Russia: “The time
may well be approaching when the
sincerity of the declared purpose of
Western rearmament namely, to
make possible effective negotiations —
is going to be tested. In any case
we can testify from our experience
to the more conciliatory temper
towards the West which prevails in
the Soviet Union today and to the
persistence with which the necessity
of peace and of peaceful understand-
ings between the major Powers is
being commended to the Soviet
people.” As for Korea, etc.?

How to Become a Dogman.
Who amongst us, watching
the dogman nonchalantly take
his precarious perch on the edge
of his box or with one foot
ensconced in the hook and see-
ing him whisked to the top of a
150ft. building, has not harbored
a secret envy of his daredevilry
and of his being the cynosure of
hundreds of upturned, admiring
eyes? For to the earthbound he
is indeed a hero.
Such a vocation has its
rewards over and above the
mere claims of common lucre.
The dogman may never, it is
true, hope to gain the emolu-
ments of the wharfie, the terri-
fying risks of whose job are so
much greater, involving as it
does the possibility of his sitting
suddenly on his billhook in his
anxiety to rest after having
worked for fully 10 minutes,
ricking his wrist while flicking
up the pennies behind the bales
of wool, swallowing his tonsils
while snoring off down a hold,
or dropping on his toe a parcel
(limit lift 121b.) which he was
just hoisting up as the lunch-
whistle went. Yet whereas the
wharfie enjoys no audience, no-
body having sufficient time to
spare to wait and see if he is
going to do any work, the dog-
man may be assured of never
being without one.
For those who feel that the
occupational glamor of a dog-
man’s life is so strongly attrac-
tive as to be irresistible, a
perusal of the following hints
should more than fit him for
such a billet.
First, it is utterly useless
thinking of taking it up, in the
two senses, if you are subject to
vertigo. A simple test will deter-
mine this. Go to the zoo, stand
at the hippopotamus’s enclosure
and keep yawning. Eventually
the hippo, will look at you and
Y iU involuntarily yawn. As he
does so take a swift look into
the enormous cavity. If you
don’t have to hang on to the
surrounding rails through a sud-
den attack of giddiness you may
take it that you have the neces-
sary head for heights. Simply
quote the success of this self-
PINTO
M X \
m
“How much the giant-size?”
administered test to any build-
ing contractor and you will be
assured of a dogman’s job.
As you will have to be pre-
pared to jump from varying
heights in case the cable snaps,
the sides fall out of the box or
the crane topples over, leaping
practice will be necessary.
Adopt the same principles on
which Chinese dentists have for
so long relied. To condition
their fingers to extract teeth by
hand, thus saving the purchase
of equipment, they start by
pulling out small nails that have
been loosely driven into a board,
gradually working up through
larger and more firmly-driven
nails until finally they are able
easily to pull out with thumb
and forefinger a 6in., eight-gauge
nail that has been driven to the
head in ironwood, thus render-
ing them capable of extracting
the most stubborn molar or
incisor.
Start, therefore, by leaping
from a 2ft. height. Should your
arches suffer no ill-effects from
this, try 4ft., then 6ft., and so on.
With constant practice the dog-
man should be able to so con-
dition his calf-muscles and feet
that he should have no trouble,
if the last cable-strand above
him were to part as he was
passing the 14th floor, in bound-
ing resiliently when reaching the
ground, with nothing beyond a
jarred fibre or two. In such a
case it would remain for him
merely to remember, as he
plummets down, to land only on
the feet he has been so assidu-
ously exercising and not on his
neck or elbow.
Care should also be taken
when stepping off his load at
the top. Usually, the top of the
building will be in a rather crude
state —that is, it will consist only
of steel joists, angles and
channels, though in the latter
case the dogman need have no
fear of being caught in an under-
tow. In case the girder he steps
on to happens to have been care-
lessly left unriveted by a work-
mate and the other end suddenly
flies up and hits him in the face,
he should prudently have left the
box on which he travelled up
about a foot lower down than
the girder. This will ensure that
if he gets knocked out by the
uprearing mass of steel —a strong
possibility unless his face is of
greater tensile strength than the
girder—he will have a receptacle
handy to catch him.
A most important point for
the dogman to observe is the
necessary perfect understanding
with the cranedriver on the ques-
tion of whistle-signals. This
system should be as simple as
possible—say, one for going up,
two for coming down, three for
sideways, or some variation of it.
Complicated systems should be
avoided. Some of the old-time
dogmen had so many signals
(f°r instance, one to leave the
ground, two to be taken into the
air three to go higher, four to
backpedal, five to hover, etc.,
that the cranedriver sometimes
had to count up to 12, necessitat-
ing in the end his using pebbles,
like the cricket umpire does to
count the balls bow ed, in order
to beat a possibly detective
memory. .
The correct use of the whistle
calls for special attention, parti-
cularly in the distinction between
the short and long blasts There
is the case of the tyro dogman
who carelessly gave two and a
half blasts instead of three, so
confusing the cranedriver that
be left him suspended in mid-air
a b night.
A dogman may find himself
working with an elderly crane-
driver whose natural craze for
speed in his youth had been
frustrated by a stern parent who
had refused to let him have a
motor-bike, and who now gets a
vicarious thrill by the operation
of his various levers. Coming
down about 100 ft. in eight
seconds, he may have need to
bring his stomach to that con-
dition that will render it proof
against lightning descents. The
first time this happens he should
swallow very hard to prevent
some vital organ from forcing
its way out through his gullet.
Going up and down in express
lifts of city buildings after he
knocks off every afternoon will
afford excellent practice.
Should the dogman notice that
his public is beginning to be-
come slightly blasd about his
work, he may quickly recapture
their interest by going up hang-
ing upside down by one foot
from the hook, or climbing up
the rope towards the crane-
pulley at about the tenth floor.
This will also ensure against the
onset of that ennui and boredom
which is the deadliest enemy of
the dogman.
Lastly, a discriminating choice
of clothes is essential —clothes
which will be in exact keeping
with the nature of his work. A
suitable outfit would be a pair
of diver’s boots, cadmium-
yellow - checked sox, plum
corded-velvet shorts, a black
singlet, a bowler hat and a neat
,bow. A tie should definitely
'not be worn.

In the reign of william hi of England
(1689-1702) a Coldstream Guardsman
named John Hatfield was tried by court-
martial on the charge of having fallen
asleep while on sentry-go at Windsor Castle. As proof that
he was awake at the crucial time, he claimed to have heard
‘Great Tom’ of Westminster, over twenty miles away,
chime thirteen times at midnight! This defence, which
sounded so improbable, was, on investigation, proved to be
justified and the soldier was acquitted. When he died in
T 770, at the age of 105, he took his alibi to the grave with
him—it was inscribed on the coffin plate.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT’S
RED MILL RUM.
As this went to the printer a
splendid field was lining up for the
1951 Melbourne Cup, and, all over
Australia, punters, armed with any-
thing from slide-rules to the trusty
hatpin, were hard at work preparing
for the annual plunge. Those inclined
to adopt a more orthodox method of
basing their choice on observation
and assessment of performances were
no less industriously, but possibly less
fruitfully, employed trying to make
head or tail of the last-minute crop
of form noted at Flemington on
Saturday—Derby Day.
In discussing the Victoria Derby
here last week present observer dis-
rated Hydrogen’s chances, with, how-
ever, the proviso “Unless he can be
persuaded to run a very different type
of race.” On Saturday Hydrogen did
run a different type of race, and bril-
liantly Justified the faith reposed in
him by punters who, taking a much
more lighthearted view of his AJ.C.
Derby failure than present scribe
could muster, sent the Sydney colt
out warm favorite again for the Vic-
torian classic.
On Saturday Hydrogen was, as
usual, slow to begin, and for a while
trailed the field. However, he was
going much more comfortably and
beginning gradually to make up
ground at a much earlier stage of the
piece than he had done in previous
races. By the time they turned tor
home, with two furlongs to go,
Hydrogen was right up to the leaders,
and shortly after hit the front.
Shoreham (who had also run very
poorly in the AJ.C. Derby) gave him
a solid tussle for a while, but Hydro-
gen eventually prevailed, and went on
to score by T} lengths. Bronton’
came home solidly enough for third
money, only inches behind Shoreham;
then came another Sydney colt in
Montana, followed by Forest Beau.
It is little wonder that in recent
years the drafts from Kia-Ora Stud,
Scone (N.S.W.), have repeatedly
topped the Sydney yearling sales.
Little wonder when, year after year,
the said drafts prove to contain
classic winners and other topnotchers.
Kia-Ora has a wonderfully successful
bunch of sires. Midstream has, of
course, been outstanding. He com-
menced stud duties here in 1938, since
when his progeny have won well over
£360,000. To go back over a few
seasons, in 1944-45 Midstream was
fourth on the list of most successful
sires in Australia. In successive sea-
sons since then he has been second,
third, first, second, second and, last
season, again first, with winners of
£64,944 against his nearest rival's
£44,196.
Other successful Kia-Ora sires over
the same period have been Le Grand
Due and Agincourt. Now, as the
need for replacement arises (Mid-
stream was bred in 1933), Kia-Ora
seems to have made two excellent
choices to keep up the good work in
Channel Swell and Delville Wood.
Channel Swell’s first crop, while
including a couple of pretty speedy
fillies, was not conspicuously success-
ful. The second crop, however, the
present three-year-olds, has been suc-
cessful right from the jump, which
was when one of them, Lloric, won
the first two-year-old event of the
season, the Breeders’ Plate. Then
Ocean Bound emerged as the best
two-year-old of the season by taking
the Sires’ Produce and Champagne»
Stakes, and he looked the early Derby
favorite. As it happened, Ocean
Bound did not make the grade this
season, but Channel Swell and Kia
Ora Stud nevertheless supplied the
A.J.C. Derby winner in Channel Rise.
And on Saturday, with a string of
good races under his belt, Hydrogen
won the Victoria Derby, to give Kia-
Ora’s other new sire, Delville Wood,
a classic winner from his first crop.
The other principal factor in the
success of Kia-Ora Stud over recent
years has been its possession of the
finest collection of Magpie mares
gathered anywhere. And, according
to statistics published recently by the
Bloodhorse Breeders’ Association of
Australia, Magpie easily tops the list
of sires of dams of winners. Hydro-
gen is one of the breed; his dam is
Sweet Sound, by Magpie from Golden
Cello. Another—again to the credit
of Kia-Ora —is Delta, who on
Saturday added the L. K. S. Mac-
kinnon Stakes to a splendid run of
successes this time up. Delta romped
home in the w.-f.-a. Mackinnon (10f.),
scoring by two lengths from New
Zealander Akbar and Grey Boots.
The Victoria Derby was, with £6OOO
added, easily the best-endowed event
on Saturday’s card, as doubtless it
should .be. However, it is disappoint-
ing to see the mile Wakeful Stakes,
one of the treble of classic events for
three-year-old fillies, quite the most
poorly-financed event on the same
card, particularly when, against £lOOO
for the Wakeful, £2500 is allotted to
the Maribyrnong Plate. Dating back
to 1871, the Maribyrnong is doubtless
a race of ancient tradition, but never-
theless it is one apt to be won by
flash-in-the-pan early speedsters of
little subsequent substantial merit.
The Wakeful, at all events, pro-
duced a real turn-up for the books
when the hot favorite Dassie was
pipped a half-head by La Castana (B.
Shaw), a daughter of Yorkshire
Hussar. La Castana’s starting-price,
“I'll use my spoon-headed spear for this one, caddy.”
For Canterbury (before accept-
ances): —

Lady, 1; Unburden, 2; Morgeana, 3.
Juvenile Stakes (colts): Tamahere, 1;

American tennis authorities have
encountered several snags in the
66 to 1, had seemed a reasonable
assessment of her previous form.
Third in the Wakeful was Gay
Comedy, winner of the South Aus-
tralian Oaks and full-sister to Comic
Court, Comedy Prince and the rest
of that remarkable tribe. The
strongly-fancied Sydney filly Blue’s
Sister, even allowing her disadvantage
in the weights, was an inexplicable
disappointment, beating only a couple
home.
The Maribyrnong Plate saw another
favorite bite the dust. Indeed, the
first three in the betting were at
shorter odds than the winner, Cellar-
Master, who, for a colt who had
won at his four previous starts, went
out on Saturday at the incredibly
good odds of 5 to 1. Cellar Master
made it five in a row, with a narrow
but very sound win over the Dhoti
filly Moonlit. Nicoora was third, just
shading the winner’s stablemate, Wine-
maker.
Other events at Flemington also
produced excellent results for the
books. A model of consistency, the
Kinderscout five-year-old Kintail (N.
McGrowdie), at 20 to 1, won the
mile Cantala Stakes from Oversight
and Zezette, and the Hotham Handi-
cap saw the 10-to-l chance Glenvue
narrowly defeat favorite Morse Code,
with Gay Felt taking third money.
* * * *
In Sydney it was back to Canter-
bury on Saturday, and that, plus back
to a six-furlongs journey for the
Flying Handicap, evidently spelled
back to winning form for the five-
year-old Talking gelding Humming
Top, an animal whose form is, at
times, a little difficult to follow.
Humming Top is trained by Jim
Munro, and in most of his best per-
formances (and some of his worst)
has been ridden by brother Darby
Munro. On Saturday Darby was, of
course, absent, but matters were
retained in the family circle when the
mount was taken by apprentice J.
Bearpark, a nephew of the Munros
senior. At all events, young Bearpark
rode a rattling good race to land
Humming Top winner by a whisker
from Mercury and Sir Gene.
Humming Top came from a long
way back to register his win, and
another to score in similar fashion
was Johnny Zero, a Collingwood
gelding who seems better than ever
in what is now a very ripe old age.
With 9st. Johnny conceded the others
a packet all round, but with N.
Watterson up he fairly whistled home
to down the odds-on favorite Neat
Andrew by a neck in the November
Handicap (Ilf.).
A most unusual double was regis-
tered when Blond Val (A. Thompson)
won the Two-year-old Maiden for
colts, and Braestand (G. Podmore)
the 9-furlongs Burwood Mixed. The
pair, both of whom won comfortably,
are full-brothers, by Hall Stand from
Blond Glory. Their dam, Blond
Glory, was bought for 300 guineas
with a foal at foot (Braestand) and
served by Hall Stand, a mating which
yielded Blond Val. It is always sur-
prising to present writer that so few
of the wealthy owners who will cheer-
fully pay several thousand pounds
for a couple of yearlings are ever
tempted to risk as many hundreds on
the sort of possibly treble bargain
represented by a mare with foal at I
foot.
course of getting together their Davis
Cup squad, and the team which
lobbed into Sydney over the weekend
diverged somewhat from the original
selection. The six originally named
were Savitt, Budge Patty, Trabert,
Talbert, Seixas and the junior Ham
Richardson. There arrived in Sydney
Savitt, Trabert, Seixas and Schroeder,
with Frank Shields captain-manager
and Jack Kramer coach. Richardson
was due to arrive on Monday.
One conclusion which can be drawn
is that American officials probably
heaved a sigh of relief when their
defending champion Larsen was so
completely pulverised in the U.S.A.
national championships by Frank
Sedgman; it saved them the em-
barrassment of being forced to con-
sider for selection a player who had
made himself so widely unpopular
as Larsen did during his tour here
last season. Even so, the American
official attitude became pretty pointed
when 33-year-old Bill Talbert was
included in the original team and
when, as Talbert and Patty fell by
the wayside and Trabert was for a
time in doubt, there was never any
move to bring Larsen into the team.
Instead, the veteran Schroeder was
co-opted.
On arrival the American captain.
Shields, made a good impression when
he weighed-in with a timely reminder
of something most Australian fans
are inclined to forget or treat too
lightly:
“We have the Swedes to face first,
and we expect that they will be tough.
It would be an insult to the Swedes
to discuss our prospects against Aus-
tralia at this stage.”
The Americans play Sweden in the
inter-zone final in Melbourne, com-
mencing December 14, the winners
then meeting Australia in the Chal-
lenge round in Sydney on December
25, 26 and 27. Meanwhile both
visiting teams will make their first
appearance in the N.S.W. champion-
ships at White City, Sydney, com-
mencing November 15.

The West Indian tourists faced up
to their first serious opposition of
the tour when they met Queensland
in Brisbane on Saturday, and they
quickly found themselves in bother
when Queensland slow bowler Colin
McCool made the startling discovery
that a Brisbane first-day wicket was
most generously receptive to spin.
McCool, who had been passed over
by the selectors for the first Test,
proceeded to have a glorious time. A
delightful innings from Christiani
held the side together for a time, but
he, too, eventually fell victim to
McCool for 43, and, with McCool’s
figures six for 83, the West Indians
were all out for 198. In reply,
Queensland had lost one for 58 at
stumps on Saturday.
If Saturday’s weather and conse-
quent attendance can be regarded as
an omen, the visitors should be
assured of a financially successful,
tour. Attendance on Saturday was
11,614 and the gate £1826. Last
season, with rain taking a hand in
proceedings, the gate for the whole
match, Queensland v. M.C.C., was
only £lO4O.

“C.S,”: The Ninety - Mile
Desert of South Australia is
mostly sand, stony flats and

Normal practice in the past
has been to sow cover-crops for
immediate cash return to offset
costs of clearing and seeding to
permanent pasture. In C.5.1.R.0.
tests zinc sulphate and copper
sulphate were each applied at
71b. an acre at seeding. Super.
was applied in the second year
at 2cwt., and in third, fourth and
fifth years at I.6cwt. an acre.
Peas were tried as a cover-
crop, but were no good. Both
wheat and oats were successfully
sown with super. They pro-
duced payable crops which
would contribute towards costs
of clearing and seeding. The

Further addition of zinc and
copper in the second year had
no effect.
Bacchus Marsh sub.-clover
was strikingly successful on
sand. It can be established under
a heavy crop of wheat or oats.
It does not require extremely
heavy dressings of super., but
zinc and copper deficiency must
be corrected by the addition of
each at 71b. an acre at seeding.
One such dressing will be suffi-
cient for several years.
Phalaris may be included in
the original seeding at |lb. to
11b. an acre, and although a
cereal cover-crop will reduce the
number of plants that survive,
sufficient will remain to produce
an excellent pasture.
Lucerne may also be included
with the sub. in the original
seeding, and will make a small
but useful contribution to the
pasture.
Head-strike Protection.
“Outback”: Blowfly strike on
the heads of rams, owing to in-
fected wounds resulting from
fighting, or to bacterial con-
tamination of excretions in the
skin creases about the poll and
base of the horns, can probably
best be treated by jetting, but it
must be done carefully, and at
a pressure of only 301 b. to 501 b.
per square inch.
Arsenical fluids have been
used in the past, but these are
likely to render rams infertile.
Preliminary trials suggest that
jetting the poll and adjacent
parts with D.D.T. or B.H.C. pre-
parations may give protection
for up to six weeks. D.D.T. at
2 p.c. or B.H.C. at 1 p.c. have
been used, the wool being
thoroughly wetted by using from
one-third to one-half a gallon
of the solution.
Dry boracic-acid powder,
worked in thoroughly at the base
of the horns, is also of value
against head strike. Shearing
rams twice yearly, preferably in
spring and autumn, prior to the
fly waves, will prove beneficial.
It is important to treat rams
prior to joining, as a high inci-
dence of head-strike can reduce
the level of fertility in the flock.
Shorthorns in W.A.
“Frank H.”; At Tibradden, in
the Geraldton district, Atkins
Bros, are putting together a
pure Shorthorn herd. Breeding
under the supervision of Geoff.
H. Sherlock is proceeding along
the lines of utilising the blended
inheritance of such sires as Cal-
rossie Red Baronet and Towic-
barclay Ossian, transmitted
through a proven formula in the
Woomargama (N.S.W.) stud;
and profiting by environmental
influence is evolving big, heavily-
beefed, early-maturing Short-
horns particularly adapted to the
conditions of North-west Aus-
tralia.
Stock bulls in use at Tibradden
include Woomargama Magis-
trate, Woomargama Maha-
rajah (both sons of Coonong
Napoleon), and Dauntless
Monarch (by another son of
Calrossie Red Baronet, from a
dam of the same [Secret] family
as Napoleon), They are being
mated with Woomargama cows
of the Towiebarclay Ossian line,
and from the Weddin stud on
which the Tibradden foundation
was laid a few seasons ago.
A few miles away at Minni-
nooka, H. M. Readhead has the
entire Calool Shorthorn stud
which he bought from W. R.
Raper (N.S.W.) and took across
Australia by special train a little
more than two years ago. Read-
head had already bought Calool
Jupiter for 1125 gns. at Sydney
Show in 1946, and was so satis-
fied that he elevated him to top
sire of the recently acquired
Calool herd. Jupiter was sired
by Munduney Emblem, from a
dam by Towiebarclay Ossian
(the sire of most of the best
cows in the Calool stud).
Readhead sold Jupiter’s sire
for 1000 gns. to his brother
Charles at Melara, but retained
the third Calool stock bull,
Coombing Double Event (by
Coonong K.C.B. —the sire of
Coonong Napoleon, from
Dorothy 29th [imp.]).
With this interesting back-
ground, the Minninooka Short-
horns are now the biggest pure
herd in the West, running on
23,000 acres of some of the best
beef country in the State.
At Seven Hills, Rcelands, a
young breeder, C. D. Bell, has a
high-class herd founded on
Calool and Weddin blood. His
stock bull is Weddin Elite, a son
of Collynie Spectrum (imp.). At
the Perth show he bought for
525 gns, the . reserve junior
champion bull, Woomargama
Proud Monarch, by Coonong
Napoleon, from a Woomargama
Broadhooks Catherine dam, by
Towiebarclay Ossian, thus
strengthening his herd’s relation-
ship with those of Tibradden
and Minninooka.
At Irwin House, 13 miles from
the coast and about 30 miles
south of Geraldton, A. H.
Gillam breeds the Gabyon Short-
horns from a foundation of
Coonong and Woomargama
females mated with Coonong
Quotation, a son of Coonong
Officer Commanding, also of the
Calrossie Red Baronet line. His
females mostly descend to the
same sire, and include several by
Napoleon.
At Hawthornden, E. H. Lee
Steere is building up a Short-
horn herd with an ultimate
polled objective, based on pure
horned stock from Nalpa and
Woomargama. Last year he
added to his herd the Perth
reserve champion, Woomargama
Summerton 26th, bought for
1000 gns. She was sired by
Coonong Napoleon, and came
hack this year to wiu the
championship.

Burn refuse straw and haulms

Don’t leave old bags and fruit-

weed-growth as much as pos-
sible.
Summer - grass must be
loosened up and allowed to die
in the hot sun while in its
initial stage. Fumigate with
carbon disulphide when keeping
seed like potatoes or corn in a
shed. Water the ground that is
going to grow tomatoes with a
dilute solution of phenyl or
creosote prior to planting out.
Let young plants like cabbage

The Orphan Pig.
“M.”: For the first week give
it six meals a day of fresh, whole
cow’s milk at body heat. Then
gradually reduce the number of
feeds until the orphan is three
weeks old, when a morning,
noon and evening feed will do.
From three weeks gradually
break down the whole milk with
separated milk until, at eight
weeks, the young pig is wholly
on separated milk. It will need
also a dry mixture of cereal
meals (four parts) and meat-
meal (one part) from three
weeks of age ,
Allow it to run on fresh
ground; if this isn’t available,
throw a daily shovelful of fresh
earth into the pen to provide
THE WEATHER
By Inigo Jones
There should soon be rains in the areas which have
become rather dry following the first October rains. This
is partly due to the cycle, which shows good rains after a
pa-use of fine dry weather, and the arrival of a rather impor-
tant southern sunspot group.
Arrival at the full active position should be early In
November. Good rains are likely, except in the wide interior
and western areas of Queensland and N.S.W., the north of
Victoria and South Australia.

the youngster’s iron require-
ments.
The Tractor.
“BilJjim”: When making a
choice buy one big enough to do
the work without fear of over-
loading, For mallee country it
should be pneumatic-tyred. If
the land is partly cleared six-ply
rear tyres of 13.50 or 14.00
width on wide-base rims can be
recommended. If virgin scrub
has to be tackled use bomber
tyres and eight- to 10-ply old
truck tyres on the front wheels.
For 16in. front wheels fit eight-
ply utility tyres.
Watch the air-cleaner. In dry
weather check the oil in cleaner
twice daily. If there is more
than |in. of dirt in the air-pan
discard the oil, clean the pan
and refill. Connections must
also be in perfect condition.
Correct type of lubricating
oil is vital to the tractor’s reli-
able functioning. Use recom-
mended lubes at all times, also
keep oils, greases and diesel fuel
under cover to minimise con-
densation. Also keep the tank
full, especially on a diesel, for
the same reason.
The tractor should always be
kept under shelter. Change oil
in gear-box and transmission at
least once every 12 months.
Every 1000 hours grind valves
and clean rings and ring-grooves.
Main and connecting rods
should be checked for wear.
Keeping the Lawn.
“Buffalo Bill”: Why do people
entrusted with the job of giving
advice to suburban gardeners
keep on telling them that they
must have soil topdressing for
the lawn?
Such advice goes back to the
ages before the discovery of fer-
tilisers, but it is still blindly per-
petuated. The amount of plant-
food which the usual top-
dressing soil contains can be
furnished in a much better form
by as little as 100th or less of
its weight in mixed fertiliser.
The fertiliser will give much
better results at much less ex-
pense and without bringing weed
hoboes into the lawn.
Fire Control.
“N’gaduri”; It is important
that throughout the danger
period the fire-fighting equip-
ment should be easy to get and
use in the absolute minimum of
time. The tank should be kept
full and in a position where the
truck can back under it. All
other equipment should be with
or near the tank so that the
whole lot can be picked up at the
same time.
Minimum needs would be a
small portable engine and pres-
sure-pump and a complete kit
of tools, an axe, spade, wire-
cutters and fencing tools, tinned
food in case fire keeps the men
away from the station for more
than a day and some old clothes,
including greenhide gloves, for
all. The lot should be packed
in iron boxes of the ammunition
type and should be clearly
labelled —although you know
your own you may be working
with strangers and at a fire time
is valuable.
Every tank and bore-pipe in
the district should be fitted with
an extra big outlet so that the
fire-fighters can quickly refill
tanks and knapsacks.
Plan gates so that valuable
stock can be shifted easily and
quickly out of danger. It should
be a rule that everyone should
carry wire-cutters and wire-
strainers. I was once the only
boundary-rider in the path of a
fire, but I had wire-cutters and
got the sheep out of the way
quickly.
The way to stop a fire and
cope with it before it does too
much damage is to expect it and
be ready for it always.
Tomatoes from Cuttings.
“A-Jay”: Tomato cuttings
consisting of side-shoots from
the axils of leaves are quite good
for late planting in the home
garden. Cuttings should be
about 4in. long and of fairly
sturdy growth. Insert in a
propagating sand in boxes or in
individual pots.
For the first week or two keep
the containers under glass or on
a window-sill out of direct sun-
light. Tomato stems trailing on
the ground often develop roots.
Cut these off neatly before they
are too long and plant them out
as separate plants, or suitable
low-growing stems may be
layered in the usual way.
Hints for the Farm.
“Jock’s Missus”: With high
egg production, constipation is
a source of protrusions. This
condition is likely where supplies
of greenfeed are not ample and
regular. Where hard droppings
are noticed in the yards, Epsom-
salt in the drinking water will
help.
“Hortus”: Many people start
to saw a piece of timber wrongly.
Don’t begin the cut by drawing
the saw up to you. Start the cut
with the tip of the saw and go
very lightly at first. Increase
weight gradually as saw runs
down the edge.
“African”; Where a large
number of hens are kept in one
run, place one nest outside in
the sun, away from the others,
and high enough to make access
by perch necessary. This will
protect young layers from bully-
ing hens; birds seldom fight on
perches.
“C. A. A,”: A supply of
autumn and winter greens will
be assured by sowing now
sprouts, broccoli, red and savoy
cabbage. Sow yin. to yin. deep
in rows Ift. apart in a bed rich
in humus and worked to a fine
tilth. Plants should be ready
for transplanting in six to eight
weeks.
“Myrrhee”; A manageable
size for the garden compost-
heap is 4ft. x 4ft. x 4ft. Place
garden waste in layers 6in. to
Sin. deep and cover each layer
with an inch or two of animal j
manure, 4in. of soil and a
sprinkling of lime. An occa- j
sional watering with animal
liquid enriches the product and
accelerates decay. Two or three
vents made by driving a stake
through the pile and rotating it
to make a hole about 4in. in
diameter allows gases to escape
and assists in the decomposition
process. After two months turn
the heap, placing the top at the
bottom and the sides in the
centre. After this turning the
heap will be ready to use in
about a month.

They were on their way to Wide
Bay, their own country. Bid-
dulph told them to go up to the
station and he would give them
some rations, and when we had
finished our walk we went home
and found them all clustered
round the kitchen, Mr. Alford
and Mr. Hedgeland talking to
them, and Tom, the cook, in a
tremendous fright. He knew
their ways, he said. They were
myalls (i.e., wild blacks) dressed
up to take us in, and in the night
they would all get up and attack
the station. He did not con-
descend to account for the
phenomenon of their all speaking
English. And then he made a
melancholy calculation that we
had only about eight hours to
live.
However, Biddulph gave them
their rations, and they proceeded
to camp behind the store, where
they made the night hideous till
a late hour by holding a corro-
boree with the station blacks.
Tom announced his intention of
sitting up all night in company
with all the guns on the station,
but I imagine he thought better
of it when he got sleepy.
The next morning when they
were peacefully eating their
breakfasts up rode Mr. Uhr, the
officer of the native police in this
district. He rode straight into
the camp. “Bail up, you run-
aways,” he said. There was not
a chance for the blacks, as the
mounted troopers had sur-
rounded them on all sides
before they found it out.
They took it very philoso-
phically, but I was quite
sorry for the poor creatures;
some of them were very lame
and footsore, and three of them
were gins. They must have
walked nearly 1000 miles from
Rockingham Bay here, Mr. Uhr
said he only heard of it two
days before, the whole police
force of Rockingham Bay had
absconded, leaving the settlers
there in a great plight, sur-
rounded by wild blacks.
Mr. Uhr left two behind, as
Biddulph wanted them on the
station and they were not
troopers but runaways from some
station. A contribution of hats
and trousers was made for these
two, and they seem very well
contented, and one of them has
been out with Biddulph looking
for horses today, while the other
has been employing his energies
in climbing gum-trees after
“sugar-bags,” or wild honey-
combs. The rest were marched
off to Port Denison.
Mr. Uhr said he did not think
they would be sent back to
Rockingham Bay but would
probably be put into Mr. Mar-
low’s troop—he is the command-
ant at Port Denison. I daresay
they will bolt again before long.
Biddulph still intends selling
Exmoor, but he has not heard
of a certain purchaser yet. There
have been several inquiries after
it, for it is called one of the best
runs in the North. I shall be
sorry for my own sake when he
sells it, though glad for him, as
he wishes to.
I hardly know now about our
visit to Sydney. Biddulph will
not be able to leave here till
either Mr. Taylor or Mr. Hedge-
land returns, and if the rivers
are up that may not be for some
time.
Yours very affectionately,
Rachel Henning.
(To be continued next week.)
The stern arm of the law lifted
one blue-clad leg over the
machine and let it fall to the
groynd “Let me have a look
at this dog, he said.
Tige, seeing the group of boys
approaching led by the well-
known Constable Murphy, tried
to wag his tail and sit on it at
the same time. He managed a
&
smirk and a soft whine, then
waited to see what was about to
happen.
Murphy bent down, patted the
dog’s head and began to explore
the hair about its ears. The
boys followed his every move-
ment with wide eyes.
“Now stand back and let me
see what I’m doing,” said the
law, and the boys shifted back
a few steps. A brief examina-
tion and the law straightened.
“There’s no fleas on that dog,”
he announced.
Jackie dropped his bottom
jaw slackly. “But I saw them
crawlin’ on his neck.”
The law turned ponderously
and Jackie shrunk before the
official stare.
“Are you doubtin’ the word
of the law?”
Jackie shook his head.
“I don’t care. I’m goin’ for
a swim,” Clive said.
The three lads started off
down the road. Billy stood star-
ing after them.
“Go on, Billy. Away you
go,” Murphy said cheerfully.
Billy shook his head. “I
don’t want a swim now.”
Murphy picked up his
bicycle and together they
walked up the dusty road. For
a hundred yards or more neither
of them spoke. Billy was watch-
ing Tige bounding ahead. At
last he looked up.
“Mr. Murphy.” The law
looked down. “Why did you
say Tige’s got no fleas?”
Murphy cleared his throat and
frowned. “Well ...” He
thought for a moment. “It’s a
matter of principle, lad,” he said,
and absently scratched a sudden
tickling sensation on the side of
his leg.
“But he’s lousy with them.”
Billy’s brow was furrowed with
concentrated thought.
Murphy patted him on the
shoulder. “Now don’t you
worry any more about it, lad.
You just ask your father; he’ll
tell you what to do about fleas.”
Billy grunted sceptically.
“Aw, he don’t know nothin’
about dogs or anything. All he
knows about is runnin’ a pub.”
Murphy nodded understand-
“You tell him, just the
same,” he said. “Tell him what
happened.”
Billy still looked puzzled, but
the law looked away across the
sun-dried paddocks, a slight
smile on his face and his tongue
wetting his dry lips.

Names of nursing homes in Sydney
where a semi-invalid man in receipt
of a pension of about £275 p.a. could
be accommodated ?
There are a number of nursing
homes in the Sydney metropolitan
area to which a semi-invalid could be
admitted. They are registered under
the Hospitals Benefits Agreement, and
are receiving a subsidy of £2 16s.
per week from the Commonwealth
Government. Because of this subsidy
the fees of many of these homes
would be reasonable, and could be
afforded by a person on an income
of £275 per annum. If you make
inquiries to the Health Department,
Sydney, indicating the suburb pre-
ferred, you will be supplied with a
list of homes to which you may be
admitted.

Particulars about Margaret Mitchell,
writer of “Gone With the Wind'" ?
Born in Atlanta, U.S.A., in 1900,
she was educated at Washington
Seminary, Atlanta, and Smith College,
Mass. From 1921 to 1925 she was a
reporter and feature-writer on the
"Atlanta Journal,” retiring soon after
her marriage, in 1925, to John R.
Marsh, a newspaper editor. She
wrote only the one book, but it
ranks as one of the “best” of modern
b'est-sellers. Over 100,000 copies were
sold before actual publication, and
sales have since run to around
10,000,000. The book was begun in
1930 and completed in 1936. It won
the Pulitzer prize in 1937. Margaret
Mitchell was killed in 1949 in a
motor-car accident.

(1) Was Dr. Evatt ever on the High
Court ? (2) Order of precedence of
judges and knights?
(1) Yes. He was appointed Justice
of the High Court in 1930, resigning
to contest (and win) Barton at the
Federal elections, September, 1940.
(2) The Commonwealth Table of
Precedence, as given by Who’s Who
in Australia (1950), lists the follow-
ing: 9th, Chief Justice of the High
Court; 10th, Judges of the High
Court of Australia, according to
seniority; 13th, Chief Judge of the
Commonwealth Arbitration Court;
14th, Other Federal Judges according
to the date of appointment; 15th,
Chief Justices of the States, according
to the populations of their respective
States; 24th, Knights of the various
Orders and Knights Bachelor, accord-
ing to their precedence in the United
Kingdom; 26th, Judges of the
Supreme Courts of States, according
to the date of appointment. Each
State, however, has its own Order of
Precedence, which differs materially
from Commonwealth practice. Also,
a knight or baronet would, of course,
take precedence by virtue of an office
held, e.g., that of Lieut.-Governor or
Prime Minister.

Some particulars about Alexander
Kennedy, a Queensland explorer and
pioneer ?
Born in Scotland in 1837, he came
out to Queensland in 1861 and started
work in the pastoral industry. He
soon managed to buy a property of
his own; during his life he bought
and sold several stations, mostly
around Cloncurry. From Cloncurry
he made many exploratory trips,
usually alone, to the west and north-
west, then little-known country. He
did a great deal to open-up the-Clon-
curry and Mt, Isa districts. For
over 30 years Kennedy served on one
local body or another in this area.
When more than 85 he became very
enthusiastic about aviation, particu-
larly as a means of developing the
outback, and was one of the original
directors of Qantas. He died in
1936, at 98. He is one of the heroes
of Taming the North by Hudson
Fysh.

Who was Xenophon, and for what
is he known to history?
Born at Athens, Greece, about 430
n.c., he is remembered now prin-
cipally because of his Anabasis, which
has been called the first of the per-
sonal war books. In 401 b.c., Cyrus,
younger brother of the Persian king,
Artaxerxes 11, tried to seize the
throne; his army included 10,000
Greek mercenaries, of which Xeno-
phon was one . Cyrus’s army, mainly
through the strength of the Greeks,
won t j, e battle of Cunaxa (401), but
Cyrus was killed. The Greeks, left
in the centre of the host ii e Persian
empire, had to fight their way back
to Greece. When their original
leaders were treacherously murdered
by the Persians, Xenophon was
elected to supreme command. He
proved a cool and calculating com-
mander, a shrewd strategist and a
persuasive orator, as shown by his
speeches to the soldiers. In later
life he wrote much, mostly of a
philosophical and historical nature;
the Anabasis was his most important
work. By showing up the weak-
nesses of Persia, it influenced Greek
thought and thus contributed to the
conquest of Persia by Alexander the
Great. A recent translation by Rex
Warner, titled The Persian Expedition,
was printed as a Penguin in 1949.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

4j&d. per line; all others 2£d. per line.
Education
I’ve just read that during “Health
Week” special efforts would be made to
impress upon schoolchildren the value of
“the outdoors in relation to health.”
What kind of nonsense are these so-called
“educators” up to? My generation
neede,d no special schooling in the value
of the outdoors. Only constant super-
vision, threats and occasional punishment
kept us from getting what we considered
our fair share of it.
That sort of thing appears to be part
of the general trend in the educational
system to turn out anything but educated
persons, I receive many letters from
schoolchildren of all ages for information
for their “projects”—which an old-time
teacher tells me are simply a device to
relieve the teacher of teaching. These
letters are generally ill-spelt, shockingly
composed, badly punctuated, and often
almost illegibly written. The children arc
certainly not being adequately equipped
to enter the industrial and business world
about which they are seeking informa-
tion.
The result is that in business we get
clerks who cannot write a memo without
the aid of stilted "business English,” and
even that is sometimes mangled. We
get girls incapable of learning shorthand
or who are too ignorant of English to
correct their own notes in transcription.
Each day I travel several miles in a
bus with a number of young teachers
around me. The “trainees” are no better,
in speech and intelligence, than the
majority of their pupils. They are mainly
preoccupied with the iniquities of the
“Department” in relation to promotions
and transfers. They are products of a
large local Teachers’ College, and what
they learn there I don’t know.
I do know that the department is short
of teachers, but only during my bus
journey do 1 realise how desperate the
need must be.
What it really needs is fewer “projects,”
fewer “weeks,” no psychologists and
more people able to teach a child to read,
write, speak and express himself orally
or on paper, as a beginning. Those things,
I should say, are fundamental to educa-
tion, and the acquisition of further know-
ledge during the rest of the school years
would be made easier. Gulliver
(N.S.W.).
National Theatre
Advocates of a national theatre got
some long-overdue advice from the visit-
ing director of the British Drama League.
He warned that before we get a national
theatre we must build up a sound audi-
ence of regular theatregoers. The failure
to realise that obvious need has resulted
in the case for a national theatre being
hawked about Australia for years with-
out the least hope of success.
It is idle to argue that the art of acting
deserves the same recognition and
financial encouragement as painting,
music and ballet, when professional stage-
acting, as an art, presenting classics of
the drama, is practically non-existent in
this country. No Government can be
expected to spend money on a project, be
it cultural or not, for which there is little
public support. Only in the field of
popular entertainment can the legitimate
theatre claim a respectable band of
regular followers, but surely it is not
intended to waste the taxpayers’ money
on the production of “commercial” plays
which are already provided by private
companies.
No public agitation was necessary to
establish our art galleries because of the
general recognition of the cultural need
for an exhibition of the best in this par-
ticular form of art. Until advocates of
a national theatre prove that they too
have a genuine art form to offer, and
earn for themselves a much bigger audi-
ence than they can at present claim, a
national theatre will never merit serious
consideration. —W. M. H. (S.A.).
The Gauge Problem
The O’Donnell change-of-gauge scheme
was worked with sliding wheels on one
axle. Railwaymen. the world over fear
any wheeled thing which has not fixed
wheels on a revolving axle. Much later
than the O’Donnell scheme another was
submitted to the Commonwealth authori-
ties about 1925 by a Westralian. His
idea was fixed wheels in pairs on the axle,
being so spaced as to equal the differ-
ence in gauge widths. The main idea
was to overlap the 3ft. 6in. gauge rail-
head and the 4ft. Biin., one pair of rails
lying for some distance inside the other.
On passing from wide to narrow the
outer wheels left the rails and were carried
in the air rail height; simultaneously the
narrow pairs of wheels took over.
An engineer from the Vic. railways,
then employed by the Technical School,
Perth, said to the inventor, “You have
it this time, but how do you manage at
places where there are points?” He re-
plied, “Now you cut a suture in the rails ;
what is wrong with cutting two sutures to
accommodate the flanges,?”
Then the question cropped up as to
whether the idea was feasible for the
engines, as narrow-gauge engines have so
much of their works outside, and the
wider-gauge engines have so much of their
moving parts inside the wheels. The
reply was “Just before the change of
gauge occurs you have a loop from the
head of the train to the rear. The wide-
gauge engine leaves the train, travels to
the rear and pushes the train into posi-
tion for the narrow-gauge engine to hook
on.”
Some engineers are willing to accept
the third-rail idea, but this has, in the
main, the same “points objection” as was
“Salt, mustard, vinegar, pepper ”
originally raised by the technical-school
engineer. Why are these engineers will-
ing to accept the one (third rail) and not
the other four rails at junctions, or over-
laps? If the bogie can be laid with three-
rail schemes it certainly can with two
pairs of rails. Where points and cross-
overs occur there are not four rails but
two rails, with the necessary additional
sutures to allow the unused rail flanges
to travel through the rails which are
crossed. — R. Tillery (W.A.).
Communist Slavery
Communists in America have been
trying for years to rope in the negroes,
their main line, of course, being to play
on past grievances. The propaganda has
had little success, and now the Booker T.
Washington Birthplace Memorial has
taken the field to state the negro’s case
against Communism. One of their book-
lets contains a statement that reads well
for white and colored people all over the
world:
Communism, as you see, is a system of
involuntary servitude, and the other name
for that is slavery. Unlike chattel slavery,
the Communist slave has no individual
value and can be (and is) simply worked
and starved to death.
American negroes organised thirty-odd
insurrections and conspiracies against chattel
slavery, and when the chance came over
200,000 enlisted to fight it on the battle-
field. Surely their grandchildren, under-
standing the case against Communism, will
fight just as hard to preserve the freedom
for which their forefathers fought.
Hydro Power-stations
The Kiewa (Vic.) hydroelectric
scheme (B. 10/10/’5l) was planned after
years of investigation extending back to
1919, patient stream-gauging, measure-
ment of snow and rainfall, detailed
hydrologic studies, economic comparisons
with other methods of power-generation
and advice by eminent consultants from
abroad.
To say that this scheme (289,000
kilowatts) will supply only one-tenth of
Victorian requirements is simply
nonsense. The planned generating
capacity of the State system, including
the Kiewa stations, is of the order of
1,000,000 kilowatts —about double the
present figure.
An excellent description of the whole
proposal, written by the State Elec-
tricity Commission, is published in
the “Indian Journal of Power and
River Valley Development” (June,
1951). There is no mystery about the
figures—the Kiewa scheme is designed to
meet between 25 per cent, and 30 per
cent, of the maximum coincident demand
during the closing years of this decade.
Further increase will be met, in part, by
power from the Snowy Mountains
project.
I would like to know what overseas
experts have been “very critical” of
hydro schemes on the mainland, and
what they have said? Commissioner
Hudson, of the Snowy Mountains
Authority, replying to attacks in the
Sydney Press, says experts from other
countries invariably ask why the Snowy
scheme was not started years ago.
Difficulties arising from low stream-
flow in drought years can be resolved by
providing “carryover” storage. Reser-
voirs under construction at the head-
waters of the Kiewa will have a capacity
of 50,000 million gallons, equal to Mel-
bourne’s water consumption in 500 days.
A. L. Galbraith, civil engineer of the
S.E.C. before retirement, discussing this
question in the December, 1949, issue
of the “Journal of the Institution of
Engineers (Aust.),” says:
In the Kiewa investigation it was assumed
that a period identical with the worst in
the past would be followed by a year made
up of the driest January on record, the
driest February, and so on throughout the
12 months. This scheme was adopted, not
as having any logical basis, but as giving
some picture of the margin of safety pro-
vided for the scheme.
'That assumption is most conservative,
and, in fact, one could hardly imagine a
more severe design criterion. Provided
energy output does not exceed the
designer’s limit (1000 million kilowatt-
hours a year average), the actuarial risk
of exhaustion of stored water is very,
very small.
In regard to costs, if the Kiewa stations
were required to operate as a separate
source of supply, the unit cost of power
might well be greater than for the
thermal stations. But, because of wide
diurnal variation of load, the unit cost
with Kiewa in the system will be cheaper
than if it were not, each type of station
helping the other. In a sense, the
problem, for which there is no direct
solution, of storing surplus power ayail-
able at off-peak hours is being overcome
—by storage, instead, of water at an
elevation of 6000 ft. on the Bogong high
plains. It is here, at Morwell and at
Eildon, that the future of Victoria’s
industrial and rural development is being
decided.— Sapper (Vic.).
Property Repairs
A major by-product of the N. S. Wales
rent-pegging legislation is the rapid
deterioration of many of the State’s
350,000-odd tenanted dwellings. The bill
to put all this property into a proper state
of repair, replacing wornout services, re-
roofing and repainting would run into
many millions of pounds.
Owners are desperate because each
year passing knocks more off the capital
value of their assets and increases the
annual cost of maintenance. Rents are
pegged at rates which in many instances
do not cover cost of maintenance and
repair even though the owner were to
devote his gross rent to this purpose and
counted the rates, insurance and other
outgoings as loss.
Just how long it will be before this
state of affairs becomes general is hard
to tell, but certainly such a time will
come. It is the practice of many Fair
Rents Boards to grant small rental
increases contingent upon the owners
carrying out specified repairs to their
property. Many owners will not approach
a Fair Rent Court because such a deter-
mination would involve them in outlay
they could not hope to recoup out of
rent increases before more repairs became
necessary.
Agents, trustees, solicitors and others
who manage property or collect rents on
behalf of owners are finding themselves
in a most difficult position in connection
with repairs. The Public Health Act
defines an owner as (among others) a
person for the time being collecting the
rent on behalf of the owner of the free-
hold. Under this Act and the Local Gov-
ernment Act, local authorities are able
successfully to prosecute such “owners”
for non-compliance with council orders
to carry out repairs, renovations, etc.
The operation of the law is such as to
compel a person having no interest in a
property other than that of rent-
collector personally to pay for any
repairs ordered, irrespective of the cost
and of his ability to pay. Agents may do
only what their principals instruct them
to do, and if an owner refuses to consent
to his agent carrying out repairs, then it
is probable that the owner could recover
damages from an agent who made any
assault on his property by way of repair,
renovation or alteration even though such
assault was occasioned at the order of a
local authority. Certainly no agent would
be able to sue an owner for recovery of
moneys spent on repairs, etc., carried out
in spite of the owner’s instructions to the
contrary.
The liability of an agent to carry out a
council’s order is beyond all doubt, hav-
ing been decided in England years ago and
upheld in Australian courts many times.
Until the present housing crisis arose,
the position was no source of concern
because any owner faced with a repair
bill he did not care to meet could avoid
having to incur it by evicting his tenants
and shutting up his property. His agents
could take such a step for him and then
relinquish their agency if they so desired.
Under today’s conditions the law prevents
owners or their agents evicting tenants,
and also prevents them shutting up pro-
perties or demolishing them. Thus
agents are in a most invidious position,
and one from which they can only be
extracted by an amendment of the law.
Such an amendment is surely overdue. —
Cave (N.S.W.).
Commercial Radio
After 12 months in Australia I am just
getting used to commercial radio. At
first it was unbearable having pro-
grammes interrupted every few minutes
by announcers telling the advantages of
such-and-such a product Later on, when
I was in lodgings, breakfast became an
ordeal. That is the time when we are
obviously supposed to be most suscept-
ible to the announcers’ charms, and a
barrage of advertisements, only rarely
interspersed with music, hits our ears.
How I longed for the American gadget
that automatically cuts out speech and
allows only music to be played. To add
to my misery the landlady was a hill-
billy fan, which surely makes me deserv-
ing of 'somebody’s sympathy.
But now, after 12 months, how do I
manage? First, I have my own radio,
allowing me to choose my own evening
programmes. Secondly, I am still too
sleepy in the morning to hear the blurb
emanating from the landlady’s radio.
Anyway, that early-morning barrage now
has one advantage. By constantly having
the time drummed into my ears I do get
to work on schedule. — J. Kolka (Vic.).

“London Belongs to Me.” The scene is a well-

Could leave a child like you alone?
Said my new husband: Little dear,
It’s lime we were away from here . . .
Finally, though not of course origin-
ally written as such, and therefore often
scrappy, this book must be valued as part
of Katherine Mansfield’s literary output,
an accidental work of art, amounting to
an autobiography, almost unbearably
tragic but full of courage and beauty and
lit all the way through with that intense
sensibility, both towards people and to-
wards the landscape, which gives her
prose-descriptions their unique radiance :
Oh dear! In some parts of the Rhone
Valley there are deep, deep meadows. Little
herd boys lie on their backs or their bellies
and their tiny white goats spring about on
the mountain slopes Then come the
pines and the firs, then the undergrowth,
then the rock and the snow. You meet
tiny girls all alone with flocks of black
sheep or herds of huge yellow cows. And
the houses are so few, so remote. I don’t
know what it is, but I think you would
feel as I did, deeply pleased at all this.
There is delight in this writing, some-
thing fresh and crystalline as a bird’s
song, and that is true of the Letters, black
and tormented though so much of the
book is, as it is true of all her prose. She
says herself of her art, “I feel as fastidious
as if I wrote with acid”; and, more
feelingly in another letter, “I mean ‘deserts
of vast eternity.’ But the difference be-
tween you and me is (perhaps I’m wrong)
I couldn’t tell anybody bang out about
those deserts: they are my secret. I
might write about a boy eating straw-
berries or a woman combing her hair on
a windy morning, and that is the only
way 1 can ever mention them. But they
must be there. Nothing less will do.” It
sounds more like a definition of lyrical
poetry than a definition of the short-
story ; but it is unmistakably the voice of
an artist,
D. S.
A Royal Favorite.
The King's Friend, a life of Charles
Berkeley, Earl of Falmouth, by Cyril
Hughes Hartmann (Heinemann),
originated, as the author explains, from
“an amiable comment by my friend,
Arthur Bryant, to the effect that 1 had
been a little unjust to Falmouth in my
Charles II and Madame.” Mr. Hartmann
proceeded to investigate Berkeley’s
character and career, and to try to “dis-
cover the reasons for the extraordinary
affection in which he was undoubtedly
held by both Charles II and the Duke of
York.”
It cannot be said that the book throws
much real new light on the subject. All
Mr. Hartmann’s narrative and analysis
seem to lead to is the conclusion that
Berkeley and Charles became friends on
sight and continued friends till a Dutch
cannon-ball carried Berkeley off and left
Charles weeping.
The men’s temperaments seem suf-
ficient explanation of their mutual attrac-
tion for each other. Bryant, much more
intimately familiar with Stuart times than
Hartmann, describes Berkeley as “simple,
unaffected and without ambition,” and
as “having gained the respect of everyone
except Clarendon,” who had a very good
personal reason to dislike him. Gram-
mont, one of many who praised him,
probably supplied the whole solution of
the relationship between King and
favorite in the words : “He had no views
but what tended to the glory of his
master.... so polished his intercourse that
the greater his power, the greater was his
humility; and so sincere in his proceed-
ings that he would never have been taken
for a courtier.”
Even the sour Duke of York, the future
James II, wrote that “he was of so
generous a nature that when any projects
of advantage to himself” Jiad been con-
sented to by the King “and some old
suffering cavalier happened to put in for
them, he released the King of his promise
to himself and got them given to the
others.” In the face of tributes such as
these, the King’s devotion to him seems
natural, especially since he was a man of
rigid domestic virtue, utterly devoted to
his wife, which must have seemed to old
Rowley a nice novelty among his
courtiers.
It is not hard to comprehend that after
studying the facts Mr. Hartmann “began
to doubt whether this man, so much dis-
liked by many of his contemporaries, and
above all by Pepys, was really the bad
character and evil influence that he
seemed at first sight.” Dislike by Pepys,
who was always of the Duke of York’s
faction, is scarcely sound evidence against
any friend of the King.
The Magazines . .
A new issue of Bruce Muirden’s little
“Austrovert” — “published when the
editor feels like issuing another number”
—has a poem of Judith Wright’s to help
along its reviews, literary gossip and
critical comparisons.
“Southerly” (No. 2, 1951) continues its
re-establishment of Furphy (a subject it
is inclined to overdo ; after all there are
other writers) in articles by R. G.
Howarth, C. Hamer and (bibliography)
Walter Stone. C. H. Hadgraft writes
about Norman Lindsay’s novels, and Mr.
Howarth has some notes on Brennan.
In a selection of “Unpublished Poems”
by Brennan from the collection of Dr.
George Mackaness “I Am So Deep in
Day” is wrongly included: it was first
printed in February, 1934, in a short-
lived little magazine entitled “The
Australian Outline,” with which Kenneth
Slessor and Frank Johnson were associ-
ated. The same issue of “The Australian
Outline” contained, incidentally, quite a
good buccaneering poem by Robert D.
FitzGerald, “At Arica,” which he has
not reprinted in book form.
“Brolga,” the first issue of a “national
arts magazine” edited by Reba Gins-
burg, is chiefly a university affair, written
by and for arts undergraduates and
graduates for distribution throughout the
Commonwealth. It is also intended,
however, for sale to the public, and, along
with verse and short stories, has an
admirable article on Robert Graves’s
poetry by Peter Edwards, and an intelli-
gent and topical survey of “The Denomi-
national University” by J. P. Parkinson.
Old Sydney,
Pen Points of Old Sydney and Historic
New South Wales by Albert N, Clarke
(Central Press, Sydney) is a collection of
30 pen-drawings depicting some of the
old buildings associated with the early
settlement of New South Wales, in the
vein of Hardy Wilson and Sydney Ure
Smith.
Some of the .old landmarks, like The
Ship and Mermaid Inn in Gloucester-
street, the Commissariat Stores
(Circular Quay) and the George-street
Asylum (Parramatta), have been
demolished since the artist made his
sketches, but most of the others depicted
have so far resisted Sydney’s almost un-
controllable desire to destroy anything
worth preserving. Besides the more
familiar landmarks Mr. Clarke has in-
cluded some delightful pictures of old
houses tucked away in little cobblestoned
lanes off Kent-street.
Designers in Britain, No. 3 : compiled
by the Society of Industrial Artists
(Wingate). A large, illustrated volume
covering the whole range of contem-
porary British products, from stove-
polish and pruning-shears to posters and
aeroplanes.

Pilgrim to Paradise: Shaw Desmond
(Rider). Mr. Desmond says the book is
his “spiritual autobiography” and that
the reader will meet “humans, angels and
demons —grisly spectres, roaring lions and
birds of paradise.” Along with such
strange fauna there are a few tangible
anecdotes about money,, sex and people,
some philosophy, much mysticism and a
very great number of words.
AUTOBIOGRAPHY.
Long ago living
was only growing,
being merely and wholly
me-and-mine-ness ... <
So little knowing
that the future was empty
of old remembering,
that the past time was only
a counted-countless
waking and sleeping . . .
Long ago living
was only my feeling,
my head among great hands,
my hands on big fingers,
a few well-known faces,
my drowning in crowds , . .
When I was bigger
around me were people
like trees or like breakers
to cool me, to wash me;
but all somehow sameness
with back-drop being , . .
Long ago living
was sitting and reading
while those in the same tram
concealed their breathing
under white hankies
and early faces
clean-shining and empty
like newly rinsed bottles.
There was no knowing
the lives I lived in me
were there all around me
strap-hanging and numbered.
Not till much later
did most-living leave me
so I could see me
in those I encountered,
so I could be me
as one and a hundred.
