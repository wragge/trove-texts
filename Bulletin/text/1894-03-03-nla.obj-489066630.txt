origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period
of many years, obtained the highest position in
his profession. The various diseases embraced in
his speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.

“ Interesting things are never true. And

The bebaubled Oliver Mowat has a unique
record as Premier of Ontario, Canada, for 24
years. As a shuffler he beats Gladstone, and he
dexterously uses all parties as tools in turn.
Nobody ever heard him say either “Yes” or
“No.”
The 1894 edition of W. D. MTntyre’s
“Legal Tables, Memoranda, and Precedents,’
published by Gallagher and Co., Elizabeth-street,
Sydney, contains in compact form much matter
which N.S.W. lawyers have to refer to every day
of their business lives, and thus justifies its genesis.
It is of little use to the average layman, whoso
simple, concise digest of the law of the land has
yet to be compiled.
Colemane & Sons’ Yio, Ointment is marvellous.
A gorgeous dude was driving in a cab,
recently, at Brighton (Eng.), his hand, with about
£lOO worth of diamond ring on one finger, resting
carelessly on the ledge of the open window. Pre-
sently an enterprising thief, with much presence
of mind, cut the finger half off, and but for the
fact that he had only a small knife with him,
instead of an axe, he would probably have got
away with both the hand and the jewellery.
In Frankfort Moore’s new Polynesian
story “ Coral and Cocoanuts,” there is an absurd
caricature of “ Bully” Hayes, who is represented
as an aitchless Cockney whose usual costume was
a black clerical-cut coat and a bell-topper hat.
There is also a Samoan octopus, tons in weight,
which assails a whaleboat, but is savagely
attacked and killed by the usual clever English
lad of gentle blood, the hero of the yarn.
Colemane & Sons’ Eucalypte Pills stir one up.
Dear Bulletin, —About the white waist-
coat. I like it, for it is cool; and my wife likes it,
for “it gives a man an air of distinction.” But I
cannot afford it. Like The Bulletin, it is “ the
beacon-fire of democracy, the forceful summons to
the crusade against the monopolist.” But there is
this difference: The Bulletin summons its de-
mocracy for sixpence, while my democracy sum-
mons me. As the vultures scent the carcase from
afar, so do the dead-beats scent my white waist-
coat. It costs me 10s. a week in meals and dosses
to people who “have had neither for two days ”
(nor a wash for two months). I harden my heart
as often as possible, but my white waistcoat
demoralises me, undoes me. Evidently it is the
inalienable badge and birthright of the fat man.
Now, I cannot afford to feed and lodge a metro-
polis, so I have given up the white waistcoat, and
the domainers never look at me. I am sorry ; for
I like it, and my wife likes it. But what can I
do, A Thin Man ?

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
The only really successful prevent-
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuti-
CURA Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, CuticurA Soap is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
Cuticuka, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com-
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer.
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25c.

ON CHOLERA INFANTUM.—VoI. VII.
“Regulation of the diet constitutes, in fact, the
principal method of treatment for Sporadic
Cholera, and particularly Cholera Infantum.
When the mother’s milk is insufficient, Nestle’s
Food is alone to be recommended.”—Pro. Wm. O.
Leobe.
On TREATMENT of RACHITIS.-Vol. XVI.
“In the treatment of rachitis, improper feeding
stands foremost among the causes of those gastro-
intestinal disorders which are so dangerous in
infant life. I recommend Nestle’s Infant Food
from personal experience of its value and con-
venience.” —Prof. Sknatoe.
On SCROFULOSIS.—VoI. XVI.
“What form of artificial feeding ought to be
selected ? The results of our own experience may
be briefly stated to be in favour of Nestle’s Food,
the use of which was but rarely attended with
indigestion, while the nutrition of the child im-
proved in the most gratifying manner.” —Prof.
Birch-Hiksohfkld.

SLIVE FOR EVER!
Was the salute tendered to King Solomon by his people.
Nevertheless Solomon the Wise died at a comparatively
early age, because he did not know how to care for that
most important organ of the human body, the liver, which
has justly been considered the great centre of life’s
machinery. In it is stored the nutriments absorbed
during digestion, which is gradually given out into the
blood to keep up the vigor of the human organism. When
the Liver ceases to do its work the head is heavy, thoughts
come slowly, the tongue is dirty, mouth tastes foul, appetite
is poor; sleep is disturbed, bile circulates in the blood,
causing a yellow tinge in the skin and eruptions, fits of
coughing, slimy expectorations, and pains in the right side.
If this condition is not checked, the consequences will be
serious to the sufferer. The best and never-failing remedy is

Professor Thulinius.—My Dear Sir,—l feel I should be want-
ing in duty, did I neglect the opportunity of sending you my
testimony as to the wondrous efficacy of your rheumatic
specific. For the past ten years I have been a complete
martyr to rheumatism in all its forms. I have tried doctors
. . . . with a view of effecting a cure for this most trying
disease I am well-known, and scores can testify
that at best I could only crawl about with difficulty. . . .
After leaving Little Bay Hospital at the close of last year I
was persuaded to try a bottle of your “Thulinius,” and in a
week or so afterwards I could get about fairly well. Upon
again suffering a relapse last February, I took another bottle,
with an equally successful result; but at last I determined to
go through a course of treatment, and I have just completed
my fourth bottle, with the gratifying knowledge that I am
quite tree from pain, can walk any reasonable distance with-
out fatigue, have an excellent appetite, and feel myself again
competent to re-enter my profession, added to which my oft-
repeated attacks of pleurisy have become a thing of the past.
I have not dieted myself in any way, so all the credit is due to
your wonderful remedy, under Providence, that my blood is
becoming purer daily," and its effect upon my liver and kid-
neys most pronounced. ... I shall only be too glad
personally to convince fellow-sufferers of the benefits to be
derived from a course of your treatment, as exemplified in
my own case, after ten years’ martyrdom.—l remain, yours
faithfully, W. H. NEWTON NEWMAN (Teacher of Elocution
and twenty-five years Actor and Manager).

A Guarantee for Wives.
Dear Bulletin, —An alleged man was brought
before a Melb. Benoh, the other day, for wife-
beating. It was the old story. He had acted the
fine fellow among his acquaintances until his
money was spent, and the publican fired him into
the street. Then, maddened with the bad liquor
he had drunk, he went home and truculently
ordered his wife to supply him with more money.
She replied that she had none—the few shillings
she had earned by going out washing having been
spent in buying food for the family, or something
of the kind. Whereupon, as is usual in such
cases, her husband fell upon her and beat her
sore, and pounded her features into a pulp, after
which he kicked her a few times for luck, and
then knocked her down and danced upon her for
pleasure. The prisoner pleaded, with a ring of
pathos in his voice, for a light sentence, if any, on
account of his poor wife who, while he was in
gaol, would have to do without her bread-winner.
The wife, with a flood of tears, seconded the
appeal. The prisoner received a light sentence
accordingly.
Instances of this kind are occurring every other
day. The bruised and battered wife, tired of
being treated as a chopping-block by the ruffian
who owns her, complains to the police, who
arrest him, probably after a severe struggle in
which their uniforms are torn—for it is a mistake
to suppose that only cowards (meaning, in this
instance, men who are afraid to fight with other
men) beat their wives. The woman, then, after
she has had time for reflection, realises that she
has consigned to gaol, perhaps for several months,
the earner of her miserable living, and that in
the meantime if she is not able to scrub she will
have to starve, and her children with her—there
are always children in these cases. Therefore, she
begs the Bench to deal leniently with her tyrant
who, she says, is rather kind to her than other-
wise when he is sober—which, she is careful not to
add, is but seldom. The Bench, taking pity on
her and her children, lets the brute off lightly. The
consequence is that ho seizes the first opportunity
to show his gratitude to her for her intercession
by smashing her up more savagely than before.
And then the previous perversion of justice is once
more repeated with similar results. These cases
are increasing in number at such a rate that if
something isn’t soon done to repress them men
who are unhappy if they have nothing at home to
kick when they are in a bad humour, and who are
too mean to pay a dog-tax and keep a dog for the
purpose, will get married expressly that they may
have wives of their own whom they may kick
with impunity whenever they feel so inclined.
Charges of wife-beating will then be dealt with in
a summary fashion,
Benoh to prisoner: “Prisoner, you are accused of
having assaulted, kicked, jumped upon, and otherwise
beaten your wife to within three-quarters of an inch of
her life or thereabouts. What is your defence ?”
Prisoner (in a voice husky with emotion): “My wife is
laid up in bed, not expected to recover, and I have seven
children, your Worship.”
Case dismissed, and subscription taken up in Court for
sick wife and seven children.
The only way to remedy this state of things is
to compel men who have once, on good evidence,
been accused in Court of wife-beating to guarantee
that they will keep the peace towards their ivives —-
the guarantee to take the form of a policy in
a society established for the purpose of taking
such risks, and conducted on lines somewhat
similar to those upon which Employers’ Liability
Societies are run. If the husband should repeat
the assault upon his wife he may then be dealt with
t 6 the full extent of his deserts, and the woman
be supported in the meantime by the Wives’
Guarantee Society. By this means, magistrates
Would be enabled to dispense justice, heaped up
ahd flowing over, to wife-beaters without being
haunted by the fear that they were signing a
sentence of starvation upon the unfortunate
wives. Of course, every scheme that was ever
invented has its weak point, and the weak
point in this one is that wives with model
husbands of whom they are, nevertheless, tired,
might take advantage of it to charge their hus-
bands with having ill-used them, in order to have
a free fling on the guarantee money while the
latter were in gaol. But, as the First Napoleon
said, you can’t make an omelette without breaking
eggs, and, anyhow, it is only fair that wives should
have an innings after all these centuries. —Yours,
Crekve Roe.

Mr. F. Coffee, of the Universal Nursery,
Wahroonga, North Shore, Sydney, sends us a
sample of dried prunes, locally grown. In flavour
and substance they are fully equal to the best
French prunes, though each individual piece of
fruit does not possess the bright bloom charac-
teristic of the imported article. However, this is
a mechanical defect easily rectifiable.

“ X.L.” : From reading many lives of
Christ, it is impressed on me that He was an
aristocrat, like Shakespeare. Take my meaning
of the word—an aloof man, hater of the bour-
geoisie, lover of the poor, like many English
Tories, their wives and families. You will see it
is the great middle class —idol of Cobden, Bright
and Gladstone —that Jesus scarifies. It is absurd
to say He tells everyone to sell off his property.
This was only a special test, imposed on a par-
ticular man, whom He wished to become one of
His preachers, and, of course, such a man could
not have any property. Observe how often Christ
dines with rich Pharisees, and the like, and says
not a word to them about selling off, any more
than to his wealthy friend, Joseph, of Arimathea,
Christ’s politics, and those of Paul, have no trace
whatever of Democratic government.

Land Banks.
Victorian Capitalism desires to turn upon
the Government of Backbone Patterson
and rend it. Its grievance is that the
Patterson Ministry is troubled, for the
first time in its history, with some
semblance of a democratic inspiration.
The new idea, it is true, is but a
feeble fragment of a thought, and is
advanced apologetically as if the Cabinet
were harassed by what serves it as a con-
science ; still for dull, conservative Victoria,
the land of whitewashed boomers and in-
solvent hypocrites, it looks almost revolu-
tionary. The nature of it is as follows :
Hitherto the funds of the Savings Bank, and
other State trust-moneys, have been invested
entirely, or almost entirely, in city mort-
gages. They are lent out at an average of five
per cent, interest, which is about half the
rate charged by the private financier when
times are good, and about two-thirds of his
accustomed pound of flesh in seasons
of depression. The principle of lend-
ing only on city properties was
adopted, ostensibly for the reason that they
formed a more stable security than country
investments, but really because it suited the
Melbourne boomers and financiers to absorb
all the State had tolend at five, or thereabouts,
per cent., and they had no desire to share
the privilege with the province at large.
But, by-and-bye, the bottom fell out of the
pretence concerning the greater solidity of
city securities. The boom proved that these
investments were about the hollo west and
the most uncertain imaginable, and that,
arable country lands maintained a
tolerably steady level at all times, the lands
of the metropolis were just a vestige more
certain than a Chinese lottery and only a
shade less treacherous than a “tote.”
# * «
Under these circumstances the only pub-
lishable reason for restricting the investment
of trust funds to city property has altogether
vanished. Treasurer Carter, therefore—
partly, it may be, as a matter of principle,
and mostly, it assuredly is,' as a matter of
policy—proposes to authorise the lending
out of £500,000 of trust money on first-class
agricultural security, at 5 per cent, interest.
The amount, in i'self, is almost infinite-
simal, but the Fac Man sees in it awful
possibilities to come. The loans out of trust
funds, though comparatively small in
amount, have helped to keep down the rate
of interest in the city, and the boomer, who
has borrowed much of these funds, has
profited thereby. But in the country, for
want of any such competition, rates have
always been much higher’for loans on vastly
better security, and there Fat Man has been
a lender, greatly to his own profit. The
banks have practically monopolised this
branch of business, and half—probably by
far the safer half—of their dividends have
been ground out of the farmer, whose utter
ignorance of finance greatly facilitated the
process. The half-million which Treasurer
Carter proposes to lend is only a drop in
the bucket, but it may prove the beginning
of a system which will ultimately destroy
this great ten per shent industry. There-
fore, it is denounced as an unsound policy, a
wrongful interference with private enter-
prise, a wanton outrage upon the sacred
laws of demand and supply, and many other
horrors.
* # #
In reality, however, the only objection to
Carter's proposal is that it is much too
small and timid to meet the emergency. The
scheme is practically an undersized and
emaciated edition of that planned in Maori-
land by Premier Ballance, and adopted
after his death by his successor, Seduon.
Despite all the execration heaped by the
Tory press on Ballancb’s project, and the
denunciations levelled at it as the wild and
crazy device of a man who was always in
search of something new, the idea is neither
new, nor crazy, nor even experimental. The
land-tanks of France, Germany, Norway,
Sweden, and many other countries, have
proved, by many years’ experience, that the
system is absolutely practicable, and the only
possible objection to it is that it does much
to break up the professional usurer and the
banking cormorant, and to destroy one of
the most oppressive monopolies with which
the world is afflicted. '1 he object of the
French and German land-banks is simply
to take money on deposit l —either perpetually
or for a long term of years and to lend it
out again on first mortgage with a 40 or 50
per cent, margin, at the lowest, rate of
interest which will pay expenses and leave
something over towards a fund to cover inci-
dental losses. The Maoriland Government
proposes to improve upon this principle by
making the land-bank a State institution, so
that with the security of the State at its
back it will be able to get money at a lower
rate than even the soundest private institu-
tion. And Carter, of Victoria, being a
pottering politician and a man of small
things, proposes to adopt a fragment of the
idea without having the courage to accept it
in its entirety.
# • •
A State land-bank is wanted in every pro-
vince of Australasia, in the interests of bor-
rowers and lenders alike. For many years
past there has been an abundance of money
to invest and a scarcity of safe investments.
It was because of this scarcity that seven or
eight millions was deposited in the bottom-
less pit of the Mercantile Bank, and almost
as much more in the Federal; and it was for
the same reason that the Commercial of Aus-
tralia was enabled to “reconstruct” some-
thing like £12,000,000, and many almost
equally unreliable institutions to annex
smaller sums by equally shady processes.
The interest paid by the joint-stock banks
was hardly any larger on the average than
the State land-bank could offer, and the
security was, and is, and always will
be, infinitely worse. The public never
had any special desire to entrust its
money to the private whited sepulchres
of finance ; it merely did it because reason-
ably safe investments were few and far
between. If either New South Wales or
Victoria possessed a land-bank backed by
State security, it could, in the course of a
very few years, obtain, without any difficulty
or any recourse to the foreign capitalist,
twenty or thirty millions or more on per-
petual deposit at four per cent, per annum.
And, as a natural consequence, there would
be twenty or thirty millions less to be lost
when the next private banking panic comes
along.
* # *
If this amount were lent out on first
mortgages, at five percent, in sums not ex-
ceeding, say, £5OO, the amount of each loan
never going beyond (50 per cent, of the
coldly-calculated value of the security, the
losses of the institution would be but few,
and there would be abundant margin to
cover working expenses and all pos-ible con-
tingencies. this, again, is not theory, but
a fact demonstrated for many years by the
land-banks of continental Europe. The first
point of difference between the proposed
system and that now existing would bo that
the interest would be five per cent, instead
of eight or ten. The second would be that
the land-bank, not being liable to panics, or
to boom involvements, or to the raids of
badly-scared depositors, would never fore-
close upon its debtor so long as interest was
paid regularly and the security did not
depreciate, whereas the joint stock institu-
tion, in almost every case, lendson “demand,”
which means that it reserves to itself the
right to rush down upon the borrower at any
moment which best suits its own conveni-
ence, and realise upon him by forced sale,
and thus reduce him to ruin. Conse-
quently the borrower is the bond-slave of the
lender—a miserable wretch who lives and
moves and breathes only by permission of
the bank, and who dare not have a mind of
his own except with the bank’s approval.
The abolition of this state of serfdom, and
the reduction of interest by nearly one-half,
would be the only change so far as the mort-
gagor was concerned, and the chances so far
as concerned the real mortgagee—i.e., the
depositor—would be that his security would
be unspeakably better while the interest
remained practically the saihe.
# # #
The reason why the State land-bank could
lend money at five per cent, and prosper,
while the joint-stock institution exacts
nearly double the amount and “recon-
structs,” is sufficiently obvious. The former
would have no dividends to pay ; it would
discount no shady bills, finance no rotten
laud companies, grant no overdrafts to
inflated brewers, speculators, merchants, and
others, lend no money on bundles of dubious
scrip, make no loans on its own shares, for
it would have none —in fact, it would avoid
all those leakages to which every bank smash
is more or less traceable. The losses by
those processes are enormous, and the
ordinary, uninfluential borrower—the indi-
vidual who pays nine percent, for an advance
on the deeds of his house or his farm, and
gets less than half the value of the property,
and lives in constant dread of being sold up
by his creditor in times of stress —pays for
it all.
# * *
A few days ago, Treasurer Carter raised
the price of Victorian four per cent, stockin the
Melbourne market from 100 to 101, in order
to check the influx of money, which, ac-
cording to his own statement, was coming in
in more rapidly than it could be used. This
was in the most distressful province of Aus-
tralasia, and at the most distressful period of
its history. Such a fact is sufficient proof
that the means with which to create a State
land-bank can be had without difficulty,
and thereby settles the only question
really at issue; for concerning the utility
of the system there is no earthly
doubt whatever. The frequent assertion of
the Tory press that cheap money leads to
booms and wild speculation and similar evils
may be dismissed in a sentence. IS’o power
on earth can create wild speculation out of a
system which will never advance more than
£'soo or£looo on any one property, which will
allow no speculator an overdraft, nor discount
his bill, nor finance his syndicate, nor lend
money on his scrip, nor assist him in any way
whatever. The equally common argument
which holds up the Argentine cedulas as an
awful example of what a land-bank must
come to is equally irrelevant. These ghastly
securities were issued, not by a land-bank
pure and simple, but by joint-stock institu-
tions of the good old Fat Man pattern ; and
they are an evidence, not that the land-bank
system is a failure, but that the banking
system now existing is altogether dishonest
and unreliable. Moreover, the one fact
which is a sufficient answer to all criticisms
is, that land-banks have been tried in
many countries and for many years, and
wherever they have been established they
have been an almost unqualified • success.
They are no wild or reckless experiment,
but an old-established institution, and the
time for arguing against the principle was
past at least thii’ty years ago.
Murder and its Punishment.
In the pocket-book of the Bur wood (N.S.W.)
town-clerk, who recently murdered the Mayor
and committed suicide, was found a newspaper-
clipping narrating the similar shooting of
Mayor Harrison, at Chicago. In all proba-
bility the one outrage directly caused the other.
The vague thoughts of revenge nursed by the
Burwood clerk were crystallised into definite
purpose by the action of the Chicago office-
seeker. The Chicago murderer fled ; the_ Bur-
wood murderer made no attempt to flee. He
shot himself as coolly as he had shot his victim.
Where, in either case, was shown that deter-
rent effect of capital punishment which is the
chief ground alleged for the maintenance of
capital punishment? Where is it shown in any
case where the proximate cause of murder is
morbidity, or insanity, or angry impulse, or
brooding malice?
* * #
Crime, disease, insanity, are more or less con-
vertible terms. Each, to a large extent, is cause
and effect of the other. No man is perfectly
sane, no man perfectly sound, every man has a
tendency to crime. This is a necessity to our
organism and its environment. The liability
to decay involves the existence of decay. No
one, says the old Latin saw, became very bad
suddenly, nor did anyone suddenly become
diseased or insane, in spite of appearances. For
beneath appearances will always be found pre-
disposing causes and conditions. There is no
ultimate sanity or insanity, health or disease,
crime or absence of crime. The dividing-line
can never be drawn. Our cognisance extends
only to the overt, but the covert is no less real.
The existence of the community is due to the
fact that the average man is rather more
sane than insane, rather more healthy than
diseased, rather more uncriminal than criminal.
The alienist who certifies that a man is insane is
himself insane; t he doctor who diagnoses disease
is himself diseased ; the judge who condemns a
criminal is himself a criminal. It is all a ques-
tion of degree, comparison. But the one is up
to or above, the other decidedly below, the
normal standard. Laws can only be framed to
maintain an average ideal ; if the ideal is above
the average the laws are proportionately in-
operative.
• • •
It follows that crime is chiefly a matter of
tendencies, and the strength of tendencies.
Publicity is one such tendency. Thus the
publicity given to Prendergast’s crime was
probably a controlling influence in Redfeabn’s.
He stood on the brink of the precipice, hesitat-
ing, as a horse hesitates before a high fence.
And as a horse, when given a lead, follows
unshrinkingly, so Redfearn saw Pkendergast
take the fatal leap, and himself exultingly
followed. There can be no question that the
newspapers which deplore in an editorial the
existence of crime, and in a descriptive article
pursue its most revolting details, are them-
selves a prime cause of crime. The pages spent
by the Adelaide press upon the recent tragedy
in that city have undoubtedly created and fos-
tered more tendencies to crime than a year’s
leaders inculcating morality can repress.
# * *
Now, it is the misfortune of capital punish-
ment that its execution is invariably accom-
panied by a publicity which no other form of
punishment attracts. The elements of crime in
the community are stirred to their dregs. Thus
it is that one crime breeds many. The interest
of a crime to the average person is immensely
increased to the criminal classes, who are below
the average. The murder which a “sane”
and educated man notices and forgets becomes
an intimate reminiscence with people-* of less
stable intellect and lower intelligence. The
hanging of the culprit markedly intensifies
this morbid effervescence. It was probably
this consideration which induced the English
Judge Denman to declare that, “if you take
the various classes of murderers, there is more,
on the whole, done by capital punishment to
induce murders than to prevent them.”
» # *
Even the advocates of capital punishment
admit that it is no deterrent to crimes of im-
pulse, which form by far the more numerous
class of violent crimes. When dealing with
crimes of deliberation, a comparatively sane
and healthy man usually forgets that his feeling
in regard Lo death is not that of' a person men-
tally or physically deteriorated. For such
death has little terror. In every civilised com-
munity the number of suicides is greatly in
excess of the number of murders. An habitual
prison visitor, the author of “Scenes from a
Silent World,” says that “ we cannot assert too
emphatically that death is not the punishment
which lawless men <1 readHhe most. Such men
often fiercely desire death. They seek it; they
look forward to it as the cure for all mortal
ills—the sure and painless refuge from the
agony of life.”
* • #
If the punishment of death were certain,
much might conceivably be said in its favour.
But there is invariably a public agitation, a
public petition, which in very many cases secures
the commutation of the sentence. The
deliberate criminal will always count on this
uncertainty. In his favour, too, is the great
aversion of juries to find a man guilty of
murder unless on the strongest evidence, since
they know that if the sentence'is carried out
there is no possibility of redress in the event of
error. And, as the evidence in deliberate-
murder cases is generally weak, because the
criminal takes unusual precautions and the
murdered person can give no testimony, this
strong presumption of guilt is frequently want-
ing.
* * m
On the whole, the balance of argument
directs the abolition of the death-penalty. But
it must be remembered that prevention is
always better than punishment. The criminal
is the direct product of his environment, and
“ every community has the criminals which it
deserves.” The maintenance of a high standard
of social comfort, the spread of education and
rational morality, the increase bf temperance,
and the observance of sanitary laws, are potent
weapons for the elimination of crime. Breach
of natural law in one generation is chiefly
responsible for the crime and the criminals of
the next.

The Case Against the Camel.
Dear Bulletin,— ln your issue of Feb. 17 you
have a cut at the man with the horse-team who,
you say, won’t adapt himself to circumstances
—meaning thereby that he should hire out as
camel-driver, or buy camels and drive them
himself. But 99 per cent, of the teamsters
can’t raise enough to' buy one camel, and you
can’t swap horses for camels. Even if they had
camels I doubt if they would do as well with
them as men of nations who have been using
them for thousands of years. If the white man
has to start carrying with camels he will soon
fall to the level of the Afghan, and go about
in rags and dirt as the Afghan does. [Accord-
ing to this same logic, if he keeps on using horses
he will presently go on scalping expeditious
like the Apache horseman.—Ed. B.]. It isn’t
the carriers only who cry out against camels.
A lot of the noise comes from business people
who begin to see that Afghans and camels are
only a mixed blessing—as the store-accounts
don’t amount to much, and they leave no wife
behind to run up bills to smash their cheques
when they come home. [Mixing the Afghan and
the camel as usual. Ed. B.]. Besides, the horse
and bullock driversare the main-stay of thetowns
out back. I dare say you, like others, think
the Afghans own the camels ; but they don’t.
The belief in Bourke is that a big Melbourne
firm owns most of them, and that they were
brought to Bourke to smash up the carriers’
union. They have succeeded, though I don’t say
that the union would not have smashed anyhow,
as carrying has had its boom just as land has,
and there are too many at it. But when you
talk of the glanderous horse being liable to more
complaints than anything else its size you are
wrong. It is man’s bad management that is
the cause of all the ills the poor horse suffers
under. As for the horse being the' cause of
gambling and fraud we can’t stand that, for
on the average he is about the only thing you
can put a few boh on and get a show for your
money. The horse will win if he can, but if
you start backing that superior animal, man,
you wilt soon find the difference. As for com-
paring the camel with the railroad, you are out
of it there, as the railroads have been the


(best friends that the carrier ever had, as any
, one that has carried over the Blue Mountains
must know. Don’t we wish there was a rail-
way right through to Coolgardie now !—how
many would stay about Bourke ? Then about
ithe camel living cheaper than the horse. When
'a clerk, ijomo time ago, wrote to the Sydney
ipapers ’ telling how he could keep a family of
■six on thirty-bob a week, you tore his yarn to
■rags an< i Hsked what benefit he would be to the
inatiop. The same with the camel. He benefits
, no olte _neither farmer, saddler, corn merchant,
.blacksmith, wheelwright, or any body else. As
for securing the Labour Leagues, I don’t wonder
at that, for they all know the benefit the horse
us to them, and have to find out where the
will come in from the camel. But, for
.all thalt, the camel lias come to stay, and so has
ithe Afghan, for if the whiteman would drive
*the -camel for 15 bob a week, the Afghan would
•do list for ten. The Afghan could give that
Sydney clerk 50 points in a hundred for cheap
iliviug, and then lick him. There is no doubt
«the camel is the beast for the Western deserts,
where there are hundreds of miles of sand, but
ihe and the Afghan are inseparable. They are
iboth dirt-cheap workers, and I have often been
<told cheap-labour is what Australia wants to
•develope her resources. Well, now she has it.
—Yours, H. Dutton, Nyngan, N.S. W. P.S.—
What a curse the camels were to Burke and
Wills, and what a blessing the horse was to
Landsborough ! — H.D.
(Tub Bulletin has tried to earn the right to speak truth
ito the workers, even when truth is unpalatable. And the
'truth is now, and ever has been, that the fittest must
sunive. The camel supersedes the horse where and
'because he is fitter and better than the horse. The
white man must, supersede the Afghan for the same
reason. The Afghan is not inseparable from the
camel. The camel isn’t born with an Afghan lied round
lit s neck, and can live and die without ever smelling an
Afghan. If the white man doesn’t know how to drive
Ihim, the white man can learn. Else what’s the good of
'being a white man ? The camel is a cheap labourer, hut
his labour profits the white man. The Afghan is a cheap
labourer, but his labour injures the while man. There-
fore, admit the camel, and absolutely exclude the Afghan.
What is wanted is a Coloured Races Exclusion Act, abso-
lutely prohibiting the importation of low-living bar-
barians. Let the Labour party set to work and get it.
They can get it if they like.—Ed. B.]

“ Stop, or I Tire! ”
Now that the Sydney police are armed with
revolvers Lite thief-taking business is conducted
on a new principle. Just about the first case
in which the new weapon was used was that of
a small and wretched - looking fowl - sneak,
or suspected fowl - sneak, in an obscure
suburb. In this instance the policeman issued
the usual challenge, “ Stop, or I’ll fire.” The
fowl-thief didn’t stop ; the policeman tried to
fire but his weapon wouldn’t go oft'; and his
prey presently vanished into the darkness. The
next ease was that of an alleged burglar at
Redfern, but on this occasion the defendant,
on being offered Ithe alternative of stop-
page or sudden death, preferred to stop,
and was arrested. From these two anec-
dotes it will be seen that the revolver,
which was supposed to be employed solely for
purposes of self-defence in an emergency,
is already being usfed promiscuously under all
sorts of circumstances. If a man is" ordered to
stop, ahd he doesn’t stop, the policeman there-
upon constitutes himself judge, jury, and—if
he can shoot straight enough—executioner as
well. A new crime has been added to the code
—that of not standing absolutely still when a
black and indistinguishable figure looms up out
of the night and orders you to do so, and the
penalty attached to, it is death (without benefit
of clergy or space for repentance), mutilation,
permanent crippling, perforation of the stomach,
or anything else that an erratic shootist, firing
wildly, may bring to pass. The defendant
may he deaf and; unable to hear the chal-
lenge many respect able members of Parliament,
judges, civil servants, merchants, and others
are so deaf that, unless the policeman yelled
his challenge into their ears or laid the matter
before them in waiting, they wouldn’t have
even the faintest idea what he was talking
about. And the deaf man might be running
because he was in a hurry to catch a tram, or
more likely because he was nervous and some-
what shortsighted, and suspected the policeman
of being a garrotter—a policeman, seen at a
distance in the dark, especially if he is travelling
rapidly, looks about as much like a garrotter as
anybody else. Anyhow, two things are tolerably
certain under the ne# system: First, the police
will have to shoot a suspected person now and
then if they don’t want to sink into general
contempt, for nobody will pay any attention to
the familiar challenge, “Stop, or I’ll shoot,” if
the officer never shoots, or always aims in the
air and never shoots to kill. Second, when he
does kill he is just as likely to kill the wrong
man as the right one. And when he has killed
ie wrong man—if the wrong man is anybody
0 importance—it will probably begin to dawn
on the authorities that there is something loose
a Tout a system which allows any irresponsible
person from iipperary to walk round executing
untried and unconvicted men with a weapon

The Ethics of Prison Industries.
A deputation of Melbourne brushrnakers waited
upon the Victorian Minister of Public Works
as week with a request that prison-made
brushware should not be utilised outside the
S™ ent . departments. In reply, it was
■ eel that the goods aforesaid have never been
isposed of in the open market, neither is there
any occasion to fear that they will be manu-
ac urert m excess of Civil Service requirements.
Ims brushmaking petition would not call for
omment if it went no further than the legiti-
ia e purpose of preventing injury to a poorly-
paic industry by the competition of cheap
prison labour. Thus far the deputation deserves
sympathy. But “it was also pointed
that prisoners undergoing sentences of a
w months gained a superficial knowledge of
6 tla(le > an d that it was probable that there
thJ- e p .Y ers unscrupulous enough to utilise
f ll ser Y lces when the prisoners were released
arli^l 8 am * SU PP I Y t,ie P ul dic ‘with inferior
j .® s * Here is a grievance at once stupid
immoral. In the first place, no (Jovern-
nt can legislate against the prohibitional ass
n employer who hires unskilled workmen to
produce bad stuff. His folly brings its own
punishment in this world of commerce. His
goods become notorious for their inferiority,
and his business dries up. If there were for-
tunes to be made by employing craftsmen who
had but a superficial knowledge of their work,
which master-brushmaker in Victoria would
object to get rich by that means ? Where does
the unscrupulousness come in, anyway? The
manufacturer who thrives on turning out low-
priced brushes, or cheap anything else, must
produce an article that is at least effective and
cleverly made at the price, and the superficial
knowledge of his workmen must be backed up
by intelligence sufficient to develop them into
first-class hands presently. The pith of the
grievance of this brushmakers’ deputation
seems to lie in the fact that convicts are able to
learn the trade at all. They haven’t the courage
to rail openly against employers who find a
billet for the poor devil of a long-sentence pri-
soner—having more than a superficial knowledge
of his business—when he comes forth into the
world again and seeks to earn an honest living.
The representative brush-maker objects to this
capable rival from the gaol—it is in human
nature for him to object—but he doesn’t say as
much straight-out. He merely drivels about
the unscrupulousness of supplying the public
with inferior brushes made by ex-prisoners of
the short-sentence class, who, by the way, are
even more likely to deserve a start in their new
industry than the “ lags ”of deeper dye. The
sentiments of the brush-making trade are un-
christian and immoral, although quite excusable,
for it is hard for men to encourage the steady
destruction of their owm interests on behalf of
repentant criminality. It is equally obvious
that the way of the transgressor is harder than
the heart of his brother, if the toil of his prison-
days be disqualified from bearing fruit in the
hereafter. Yet each trade in turn would rise
at a proposal to make it a special prison trade,
and a particular hunting-ground for “ free ”
labour. The honest unemployed clamour for
work from the Government, whilst prisoners
are compelled to assist in making outside labour
scarce. On the other hand, how can a prisoner
hope for reformation save through useful em-
ployment in prison ? And, again—well, think
it all out for yourselves.
Sugar and Salt.
For the second time within a very few years
the Victorian Government has undertaken to
assist the manufacture of beet sugar with a
bonus. On tins occasion the Government offers
a purse of £15,000. Last time the grant was
£lO,OOO, a syndicate being formed to obtain it.
When the syndicate had produced the stipu-
lated quantity of beet sugar it grabbed the
bonus and ceased operations. The present
syndicate led off by asking a gift of £25,000
down, with which to buy machinery (duty free)
from France, and found a gigantic business.
This request being somewhat too “ steep ” for
the times, the Patterson Government has com-
promised the matter as aforesaid. It doesn’t
follow that the second sugar-beet job will
prove an utter failure because the first
job was merely a joke at the taxpayers’
expense. What with heavy duties on im-
ported sugar, and the remission of duties
on all implements of this proposed trade, and a
cheque for £15,000 from the benevolent Govern-
ment at the end of, say, a year, the beet-
sugarists ought to make a fair start in life.
Nevertheless, the article they propose to manu-
facture is so dead sure of customers that one
can scarcely conceive the possibility of banks
and private capitalists refusing to run a sound
scheme on its business merits. The inference is
that a tempting scheme hasn’t yet been pro-
pounded on paper, and that the numerous
individuals (apart from the syndicate of yore)
who have thought about Victorian beet in con-
nection with the sugar trade, have seen good
reasons for not putting their thoughts into hard
cash. Also, the rashness of the Government
offer excites wonder as to why Patterson and
Co. don’t encourage the struggling salt indus-
try at French Island and elsewhere. Salt from
the briny ocean is produced in considerable
quantities by evaporation, natural and arti-
ficial, and is being sold as soon as produced,
whereas the beet-sugar is not certain to be sold
for household consumption after the bonus
benefited the producers. Of the two industries
salt has at least an established claim upon
Government aid, if public money is to be
granted to trade pioneers. Men with no
capital at their backs have kept the evapora-
tion salt business going for some time now, and
a very modest bonus would probably enable
them to soon increase their output tenfold.
Unfortunately, the practical, hard - working
person cast away upon an island has no time
or opportunity to set up as a saviour of his
country, and ask the Government for £25,000 on
account.
“ A Divided House.”
Mr. J. Chris. Watson, chairman of the central
committee of N.S. Wales Labour Electoral
League, writes as follows :
Dear Bulletin,—ln the opening portion of your leading
articled Feb. 17, thereis(jam deleted—Ed. B.) . . but
when the writer gets down to detail he drifts into a con-
fused jumble of rumour and tittle-tattle unworthy of Tub
Bulletin, A few of the many inaccuracies:—
1. It is not and never has been the desire of the leaders
outside the House to eject the present Labour members.
On the contrary, they were loyally supported until they
showed their disregard of the will of the majority as
expressed at the November conference. We admit the
value of their experience, but are not going to purchase
it at the cost of effectiveness-
2. The “so-called ” conference (of which three months’
notice was given) did not set itself to heap contumely on
the present members. Three or four delegates out of
200 blamed the party for not seizing all the opportunities
that were presented, but the conference as a body said
never a word in depreciation of the Labour M.'sL. A. In
any case, “ experienced ” politicians should be able to
stand a little slang-whanging at the hands of one or two
“blatant ignoramuses” without being moved to lake a
jaundiced view of everything passed at the gathering.
3. The proposition attributed to the conference to con-
fiscate members’ salaries was ironically moved by one of
the present members as against a motion that labour
Ms.P. be asked to contribute 1 per cent, of their salary
for propagandist purposes. However, thedelegates would
brook no such interference with the principle of payment
of members ; though I suppose it will be said that this was
because each man felt he might some day be affected
personally.
4. Referring to the “ test-oath,” this merely asked for
solidarity on the Labour platform, the fate of a Govern-
ment, or questions of monopoly (the Colo Valley grab, for
instance). Solidarity was an understood thing in 1891,
when the present members were elected ; a pledge defin-
ing it was explicitly adopted at the conference cf January,
18ii2 ; and that pledge was only modified at the conference
of November, 1893, because it was thought that it would
then suit the Labour members. Tub Bulletin has, on
many occasions, urged the necessity of solidarity; the
German Labour-party and Ihe Irish members of the
Commons have shown that it is possible; and the rank-
and-file of the workers in New South Wales are deter-
mined to have it. Division among those in Parliament is
quite as damaging as among those outside.
5. It is not a fact that the Central Committee select
candidates. If a branch of the League cannot agree on
its candidate, the advice of the committee is sought and
only acted upon if thought proper. As an executive
body, consisting of one delegate from each branch, the
committee has only to carry into effect the decisions of
the conference. For attempting this it is vilified by
those who desire that each man should be a law
unto himself. Why not at once proclaim themselves
Anarchists ?
6. Very few of the delegates on the committee have
been selected at all; in still fewer instances have they
been selected for safe seats; and in each case they have been
selected solely by the members of the local branches, who
have a perfect right to please themselves, so long as their
candidate is prepared to abide by the rules.
7. Tfle Labour members have not yet said that the
fiscal question cannot be sunk. And as the full privates
have sunk the matter there is no reason why the officers
should not do so. The man who is honestlv desirous of
working for Labour must be prepared to make all else
subordinate.
The foregoing will doubtless occupy ail the space I
dare ask for, so the gratuitous abuse of the “ new candi-
dates ” may go for what it is worth. Regarding the
general position, several of the best men in the present
party have signed the solidarity pledge, and personally I
have little doubt that before the elections come we will
have agreed on a course of action and present to the
monopolists a united front, which should and must result
in victory.
[ln reply: (1) The Labour Conference demanded
that the Labour members should work on an
impossible caucus system, and when they
pointed out its impossibility called it “ dis-
regarding the will of the majority.” (2) If the
conference didn’t set itself to heap contumely
on the present members it must have heaped
the contumely unconsciously out of the natural
hoggishness of its character, and because it never
learned ordinary courtesy. (3) The conference
didn’t content itself with suggesting that the
Labour members be asked to contribute 1 per
cent, of their salaries ; it proposed a whole lot
of things besides. The above was only the
mildest of a whole string of resolutions. (4)
The test “merely asked for solidarity,”
as stated, said solidarity to be arrived at by a
system of perpetual caucus which all
reasonably sane men recognise as utterly im-
possible. (5) The Bulletin never said the
central committee selected candidates. (6)
“Very few of the delegates on the committee
have been selected at all.” Quite true. But
of the few candidates selected, a very large
proportion are members of the committee, and
if the proportion is kept up all through, nearly
every committee-man will be a candidate. (7)
The Labour members, it is perfectly true, have
not said that the fiscal issue can’t be sunk.
They don’t require to say it. They haven’t
said either that they are alive, but the circum-
stance is tolerably visible all the same.]

The Cheap Female Clerk.
A few days ago, an advt. appeared in a Sydney
paper for an efficient lady shorthand writer,
typist, and invoice clerk, at the truly miserable
salary of 255. per week. Thereupon a male,
evidently in the same line of business, wrote to
the paper under the heading, “ Are the Women
Killing the Men ?” as follows ;
This question can be readily and truthfully answered in
the affirmative. The replies to that advertisement were
no doubt numerous, and one has only to look round the
various offices and shops of Sydney to find that women,
for the sake of earning a few pennies to buy finery, are
treading out the honest male toiler. The qualifications
mentioned in the advertisement appended were some
years back entitled to remuneration of £4 a week.
To-day, with the trebly cursed interference of
women, who have always been wreckers of trade,
the billet is reduced to Chinese rate. Woman, in
her endeavour to stick the quill behind her ear and
sharpen pencils, is peculiarly similar to the Chinaman. A
Chinaman is satisfied with a pair of Mue trousers and an
opium bowl, and doesn’t care a red cent how the rest of
the human beings are suffering. A woman is satisfied
with dieting on bread and water if she can by doing so
bring a rival to the same pitch, and has a few pence to
invest in a gambling “ bankrupt soft goods sale." The
woman question is becoming a far more dangerous one
than any which now affect social existence and social
enjoyment.
The above is a brilliant example of loose and
reckless generalisation. Somehow—no one
knows exactly how—it is one of the fixed
superstitions of the day that female labour is in-
creasing enormously in Australia, and that (this
is the main point) the cheap female is
mainly responsible for the awful fall in wages of
recent years. And the Daily Telegraph’s cor-
respondent, in assuming this view of the case,
never takes it into consideration that the female
toiler may sometimes be “ honest,” and that
the “honest male toiler” is not always any
more honest than the average. Also, he ignores
the fact that even a woman may have a yearn-
ing for bread, and meat, and boots, and a house
to live in, and that she doesn’t work exclusively
for finery any more than the male worker does
for gorgeous ties and shiny bell-toppers.
For it is a lamentable fact, and one for
which the Telegraph’s correspondent offers
no alternative, that a female, who has
no husband to support her, must live somehow,
or else be sent to gaol for vagrancy. Yet even
with all this the female clerk is mostly a super-
stition—not a reality. The manufacturing in-
dustries of N.S. Wales are reported by Coghlan
to give employment to 1459 clerks, and of these
only 30 are females. And if an average is taken
for the last twelve years of all the persons em-
ployed in all the industries of the province, it
is found that the female and the male em-
ployes are increasing at about the same ratio.
The alleged sudden rush of women into
the labour-market is a mere superstition ; there
is no sudden rush of any kind. And though
wages have fallen dismally in those trades
where women compete with men they have
fallen quite as violently in trades where men
only compete with each other. Also, they have
done the same in the trades where women only
compete with each other. It is the Fat Man in
his many aspects who is the cause of the fall,
and the lean and haggard she-toiler’s share in
the disaster has been infinitesimal.

The little side-manoeuvre of Jacob Garrard,
Esq., M.P., to make N.S. Wales Hansard
stink in the nostrils of an embarrassed Go-
vernment, has failed, because Garrard overdid
tbe job in stating the cost of Hansard at
£16,000. In round figures, the Hansard re
porting staff costs £5758 a year ; but, as £3ooq
of this is due to the cost of iSoleot Committees,
tlie net cost of the HANSARDsbOrthand writers,
as applied to Hansard proper, is £2758. The
binding, and paper totals in cost
£0690; grand total, £8448 per annum, or a
little more than half of -Garrard’s stretcher.
However, even if the Hansard cost £20,000
a year, it is a necessary adjunct to Par-
liamentary proceedings. It is the one effective
Nemesis that gib-bets the “ rat ” politician, to
whom it is a poisonous record, convicting hire
either of present or past political sins, or of
■both. It is the one indisputable evidence ‘that
can be brought against the Jim Crow member,
who, otherwise, would brazenly brand accusers
with retentive memories as lying or as forget-
ting, according to the desperation of his situa-
tion. Hansard is more necessary to Parlia-
ment than are the police records to the criminal
department. The average political schemer
will swear anything and deny everything.
Lawyer Gaunson publicly offers to show that
the Mercantile Bank case is a political prosecu-
tion, one-half of the Vic. Ministry being. for
it, and the other half against it. How artless !
Gaunson states, furthermore, that it is not
Bryan O Loghlen who is levelling the present
prosecution. How unnecessary-! Australia is
quite aware that Bryan, for his part,
levelled a nolle prosequi , and the object of
Gaunson in thus calling attention to the old
scandal of Isaacs’s oustment from the Cabinet
is past all understanding. By the way-, if the
present proceedings did really emanate from
Paihament the fact had better be announced
the housetops without delay for the sake
of Parliament’s character. After which the
world will be glad to know which half of the
Ministry was either against the proving of a
prima facie case, or in favour of dropping tl e
said prima facie case after it had been proved.
Gaunson offers to show one of these two things,
and, on reflection, he is sorry that he snoke, we
imagine,

som ® weeks past the public has been
afflicted with blobs of nonsense about the strikes
in the N.S.W. northern district, and by the
daily exaggeration of the actions of women and
smallboyshas been led to conclude that the whole
of the northern coal trade is utterly disorgan-
ised, and its future jeopardised by the incon-
sidcrate actions of the miners. As a matter ol
fact, the coal-getters of three of the smallest
and least-financial mines are on strike—Stock-
ton, Co-operative, and Greta. The Stockton
miners reluse to cut coal at the district rate,
because their proprietary are selling for 3s. a ton’
more than any other co. in the district, and
according to an old custom the he\ving-ra(e
should bear a fixed ratio to the selling price.
The miners in the other two pits struck because
the owners refuse to pay even the district rates.
At Stockton there has been no disturbance he
yond tinkettling by the women, and even thi;
mild expression of hostility has been discon
tinued. The row at Plattsburg has been much
exa ggerated, an d would never have occurred had
the police been led by a cool, common seuseofffcei.
While they were convoying the tributors (»,«.,
blacklegs) to their homes amidst the jeers ami
tin-banging of tlie women, Sub-Inspector Duffv,
with indiscreet petulance, snatched a kerosene-
tin from a woman and—an act of still greater
folly—threw it among a crowd of men. it
struck a miner named Banfield, whereat he,
with more pluck than caution, attempted to
punch the inspector’s head. Immediately ji
zealous constable drew his baton and, according
to the unshaken testimony of five witnesses
(one a reputable solicitor of Newcastle, an
other the editor of the VVal.lsend Sun) began to
hit around freely. While so doing, the wit-
nesses alleged that he struck to the ground
with a blow on the shoulder a young woman
named Wilson who had a child in her arms.
Can anything be imagined more calculated lo
inflame the passions of men already greatly
excited ? The result was that Banfield and
others were arrested, and some horribly dis-
torted versions of the affair wired to Sydney.
With the exception of the few mines men
tioned, the coal-trade at Newcastle is at present
far brisker than it has been for the last two
years, and there is every sign that the present
activity will last well over the winter. Aboht
5 per cent, of the miners are on strike, and
these could easily be absorbed by the other
mines.

The Sydney jury who, last week, recommended
O’Neill and Mutch, found guilty of having set
fire to the Tarragon Hotel, to mercy on the
ground that they were married men, received
from Judge Windeyer in an intensified form
the rebuff made and provided, apparently, for
all interferences of juries between the word of
their verdict and their sense of the circum-
stances of the crime. “ Your reason for recom-
mending to mercy,” badgered the Judge, “is
that they are married men. That is no reason
at all.” Of course, a married man who
commits a crime is not less guilty be-
cause he is a married man—nor did the
jury imply that he was. But a married man
who is sentenced, say, to three years, gets a
sentence wider in range than does an equally-
guilty single man sentenced to the same term,
inasmuch as the married man’s wife and children
are also, in a degree, sentenced under the same
judgment. If a married man get hard labour,
his wife thereby gets hard labour and his
children get hard labour. There is, therefore,
reason in a jury’s recommendation, as in the
case in view. On the other hand, if gaol
discipline and administration were what
they ought to he, this ground for a recom-
mendation for mercy would be taken away, for
the married man would be set to remunerative
work in gaol, and a proportion of his weekly
earnings would pass over to Ms family. The
title to mercy does not vest in the criminal
husband hut in his wife and children who need
him as breadwinner, and who have a natural
claim that he shall either be turned to use on*
their behalf while in prison, or that, in their in-
terests, he he sentenced to a period less pro-
tracted than if his retention in gaol injured
no one. That’s practically what the jury
in the O’Nf.ill-Mutoh case meant and what the
Judge, confident in his knowledge of letter-law,
failed, or chose not to, perceive.

Melbourne Confidences.
Melbourne, Feb. 27, 1894.
The Chinese Mission Hall ceremonial of the
other afternoon, attracted more than the Elect. In-
quisitive virgins, who had long secretly yearned for
a peep at that foi bidden locality, “ Litt'e Bourke-
street,” were glad to gratify their curiosity under
a cloak of : Christianity and adequate police pro-
tection. To such as these, the result was dis-
appointing. The scene, dark with clergy and
their sister souls, and thinly pervaded by soaped
and frock-coated Chinese converts, was hopelessly
respectable. We had expected to see all sorts of
dreadful things, and would fain have found an
opportunity to shudder. A furniture factory
opposite, its windows manned by haggard, sunken-
eyed “ Chinks,” broke the monotony slightly and
drove home the idea—to my mind, at any rate —
that Chinese, being as they are, should not be
encouraged by ecclesiastical fuss and flattery to
prolong their sojourn in this land of broken pro-
mise. As proselytes, though, they are infinitely
more interesting than smug Sunday - school
■cholars, “ who need no repentance.”
Bishop Goe, fresh and frilly as the first baby’s
bassinette, and quite a credit to his laundress,
arrived punctually with a “something to be
given away ” look in his dark-green eyes, and was
rewarded by the anticipated silver trowel. Poor
man, he sighed a little as he dallied with his
trophy. It is at such times as those —as the Duka
of Plaza-Toro might observe—that one finds cause
to regret the steady fall in the price of silver.
The pastoral staff was borne by a downy olerio
whose crushed appearance aroused sympathy. A
man and a brother carrying his boss’s baggage is
never an inspiriting sight, and when a shepherd
won’t carry his own crook, the sheep feel he’s
above his business. I’m only a simple lamb my-
self, but I felt the same as my aunt.
Talking of bishops, the new occupant of a New
South Wales diocese is described by the press as
belonging to the “high, broad school.” As a
curate, some years ago, he almost provoked a riot
in one of the chief girls’ schools of Melb. by the
altitude of his doctrines. A detachment of young-
lady boarders from said college, who were pro-
ceeding to the goal of Confirmation under his
guidance, soon began to whisper dogmas which
gave dire offence to their short and narrow school-
fellows. The bone of contention was a catechism
which laid down as a hard and fast rule that the
only two churches were those of England and
Rome. All other religious bodies were sects, the
difference being that “a Church was founded by
God, a sect by man.”
Those collegians, who in the light of this teach-
ing stood revealed as “sectarians not of God,”
took their disgrace in no meek spirit, and a bitter-
ness ensued which stopped short only of scratches.
Nor was it allayed until a rumour began to gain
ground of a handsome preacher in a neighbouring
temple. One touch of curate makes the whole
girl-world kin, and church, kirk and chapel, bury-
ing the hatchet, wrote for parental permission to
join the Anabaptist persuasion, and giggle at the
Adonis in question.
The Gunpowder shivoo at the Exhibition last
Saturday night was considerably spoilt by the
electric-light fiasco. One hears so much about
military precision and promptitude, “ready, aye
ready,” and all that sort of thing, and then,
after waiting ever so much past starting time,
to begin in the dark! Farewell another
bright illusion of childhood ! When an enemy
does come to Melb. methinks we’ll be bom-
barded in cold blood, with no consolation but the
thought that in an hour or so, when we’re all dead
and done for, our tardy defenders will sally forth
and take a dread revenge.
The dresses, so far as could be discerned in the
dim religious light, were tame. The wife of a
military potentate was in white, with a sailor hat
banded with red, white, and blue. When long
gloves don’t come up far enough to meet short
sleeves, and the intervening two inches of arm
happen to lie in the region of the elbow-joint, it
goes without saying that the result is not exhila-
rating for the onlookers.
Women of the present day are, as a rule, nob
fortunate in the matter of arms and shoulders.
Thirty years ago every girl in a ballroom was fear-
lessly decollete ; now nine out of ten acknowledged
belles draw a veil of chiffon over these portions of
their anatomies. An artist tells me that either a
vemj short or quite a long sleeve is the best treat-
ment for a skinny arm. A half-and-half covering
is always trying, and to conceal the whole limb
but the elbow is a greater mistake than white boots
on large feet.
To return to the “ tattoo.” An eminent politi-
cian, entering unnoticed, blundered into a seat
which a strategic dame had guarded jealously the
whole evening for hubby’s “superior orficer.”
The man of peace was palpably unwelcome.
Civilian commonplaces fall heavily on ears accus-
tomed to the conversational canter of dashing
militaires, and the clank of spurs.
When the “Red Cross knights” dashed on to
the arena an old lady (in the reserved seats) re-
marked cheerfully: “ Here’s the ambulance
corpse!” “Ambulance waggon, mother!” said
her daughter acidly. The ancient wanted to ex-
plain that it wasn’t the vehicle she was talking
about, but her offspring, who married into Parlia-
ment and dislikes late discussions on principle,
froze the words on her lips with a stare that was
below zero.
The Premier and family party graced the scene,
the ladies in plumed hats. Nothing cavalieresque
or startling, you know, though “ plumed ” ex-
presses the effect exactly. After a short pro-
bation in the reserved seats the great man was
brought to bay by a military scout and driven
reluctantly into a State box. Personages have
their trials; at one moment socially cold-
shouldered and at another officially exiled into
lonely splendour. I don’t think Mrs. Patterson
was built for lonely splendour, though there are
few women more classical in face. The eagle-
visaged lady might well sit for the portrait of “ A
Roman mother.”
In addition to upper atmosphere handshakes
and curving parabolic hat doffings, there ia in
vogue at present among sassiety top octaves a
lip to-ear style of conversation, initiated by cer-
tain “ toney ” matrons who want to look as
confidential" as possible when discussing the
weather with imported aristocrats. The approved
method is (when addressed) to approach one’s ear
to the lips of the speaker, and postpone your reply
until he in turn draws near with his little sound-
catcher. The raison d’Jtre of the deaf old lady
has been discovered at last, and ear-trumpets are
doomed in the best circles.
It may have been the exigencies of this fashion
which suggested the recent crusade against beards,
women being notoriously ticklish. The beard
question is still being fought out on domestic
hearths, though not ventilated in the cold atmos-
phere of the press. Women, as a rule, hate
beards. When Lady Hopetoun returned from her
trip ’Ome and found that, in her absence, Some-
body’s chin had blossomed —like the “bottle
brush”—she at once put down her arched De
Moleyns foot, and —well, the photographs in shop
windows showed the result. They say he had
a choice between two deeds with the razor, and
he elected to live on in a shaven state.
Mrs. Cross (“A.C.”), writer of “Three Miss
Kings,” etc., seems to have different tastes from
most of her sex. Two of her shorter stories are
cursed by a hero with a “long red beard.” How-
ever, she yields to feminine prejudice so far that,
in both cases, when hugging-point is reached, the
delinquent lays his beard to one side, that it may
not tittilate the heroine’s tiny ears, as her head
reposes on his heaving chest. All the same, Mr.
Cross, when last heard of, though short, stout,
and reddish, did not wear a beard. No husband,
perhaps, is a real hero to In's own wife.
Poor old Mr. Bland, who died at Clones this
week, after 40 years mining in that town,
had seen his happiest days before ever he came to
Victoria. In the early thirties he played a pro-
minent part in West Australian politics, and an
“ old family ” still possesses the station originally
taken up by him. He is buried beside his wife at
Brighton, while the departed lady’s former hus-
band and the first Mrs. Bland both repose in the
more copgenial soil of the sister province. This
sort of arrangement is rather calculated to lead to
scandals on Resurrection Day.
Miss Shaw, the Times correspondent, declares
that the crying need of Australia is a supply of
“young marriageable females.” Looking at the
matter from a purely feminine standpoint, I think
Miss Shaw is mistaken. We are like a certain
American spinster, who openly proclaimed that
she “ didn’t hanker after strange 'women.'" A few
thousand tons of matrimonially-inclined young
men would be distinctly less objectionable in
many respects, but ray idea of a necessary ship-
ment is a cargo of rich uncles ready to wheeze,
“ Bless you, my children !” and throw bags of
money at the happy pair. Every new-churn pro-
fesses to have ten rich uncles in Hingland, and
it’s high time the old gentleman came out to see
how “Jack, you dog!” is getting on. A Doting
Uncle Emigration Society might do a lot of good.
I hear that Squatter Manifold, of Camperdown
region, prepared to receive the Hopetouns on the
same scale as a British duke condemned to enter-
tain the Heir Apparent and party for a week. A
new wing— to be called the Hopetoun wing, no
doubt—was added to the Manifold station-house
for this historical occasion. There was also
a large outlay in chairs, carpets, and other
knick-knacks likely to meet the wishes of an
earl and countess. Time didn’t permit of the
building of a fresh house altogether, but enough
was done to convince the noble guests that their
duty lies in the country. By looking up each
member of the “landed gentry” in turn, after
sending six months’ clear notice of their advent,
they might do a terrible deal for trade and pre-
vailing depression. Eventually they might even
be the means of bursting up those big estates in
a sociable sort of way. A good many English
country “swells” have parted with their family
possessions all through the Prince of Wales being
fond of coming to visit them. Then why shouldn’t
the loyal Midases of these parts likewise shed
their blood for the reigning sovereign? Taking
blood to mean money, of course. Van M.
“The Bulletin’s” Missing-Word
Competition.—No. 11.
The above Competition closed with 9868 investors,
equal to £493 Bs. In addition to this, the sum of
.£lOB Is. was brought forward from the previous
Competition (No. 10), in which there were no
successful guesses, making a total of .£6Ol
9s. for distribution. The principal demand
was for such words as “idea,” “conception,”
“job,” “bauble,” “suggestion,” “proposal,”
“scheme,” “ dodge,” and- “ proposition.” One
particularly brilliant competitor suggested “ Sir
Henry Parkes,” and another staked bis shilling on
“isn’t.” The correct word, “ARTIFICE,” was
sent in by 26 competitors, whose names and ad-
dresses will be found below, and who are entitled
to a dividend of £23 2s. Bd. each. Curiously
enough, not one winner bails from Victoria, a
circumstance which is doubtless owing (if not to
the curse of Deeming) to “ the blighting- influence
of Protection ” :

There is a good deal more of the shamrock
than the other vegetable in “The Shamrock and
the Rose ” —the latest effort at Sydney Her
Majesty’s, and a piece concerning which The
Bulletin would like to get some serious re-
marks off the region of its lower waistcoat. It is
a truly Irish drama to begin with, because there
is the informer in it, and the praste, and the
agent, and the boreen, and the potheen, and the
dudheen, and the wildly hilarious “bhoy” who
saves everybody promiscuously ; likewise the
armed constabulary, and the eviction, and the
person named Phelim. Apart from these matters,
however, it is not like the ordinary Irish drama,
but branches out into new paths of blood and
devastation. The villain has an even worse time
in it than usual, and, in addition to being bowled
out at the end of every act, he is treated with un-
precedented violence. His head is nearly shaken
off in the first act. He is partially brained by a
stick in the second. At the end of the third the
funny man bounds out of a large trunk, and clubs
him, and then throws him overboard ; and at the
end of act 4he is shot. Also, in a general way,
he is dragged through all the finest scenery in
Ireland, and found out at nearly every interesting
spot in the country; and the English girl scorns
him, and the Irish girl persists in lying insensible
with her head in the dust outside his gate, and in
having hysterics all over'his ill-gotten property ;
and the father whom he threw over a cliff turns up
again with a Scotch accent and a pair of brief
check pants to denounce him, and his accomplice
—the man with the awful black eye—rounds on
him, and even the lady that he killed and put in
the box comes back alive just in time to tell him
that she is glad he is dead. This villain never
gets one decent show in the whole drama; he
never has any peace, and he is always paying away
his last cent in the middle of the night as hush-
money, and why he continues being a villain
under such hopeless conditions passes compre-
hension,
* * *
The above, however, is nob necessarily
meant for adverse criticism. Taking it all round,
the drama is a good one, and contains a com-
mendable amount of go and energy. Mr, Hay-
man, as the depraved person whose half-demented
victim will come and have convulsions opposite
his front window, is a solid, satisfying fiend in
knickerbockers —no lofty villain is genuine with-
out knickerbockers. Sterling Whyte’s agent
is a cast-iron Highland usurer, and is distinctly
the best feature in the programme; and Messrs.
Hodson, Sweeney and Harconrt—the last-named
as the dirty accomplice with the horse-laugh—are
satisfactory. Miss Athena Claudius is modestly
unimpressive, and Miss Maud Williamson—who
is betrayed and goes mad on the doorstep—has the
house with her all through. Certain desperate
struggles with, the scenery in which the co. got the
worst of it, including a murderous conflict with a
back-cloth which went up sideways, didn’t im-
prove things on Saturday. Also, there are sundry
scraps of morality in the dialogue that are
eminently objectionable, and a horribly stilted
agricultural hero who wears gaiters—no simple-
minded agriculturist is genuine without gaiters—
and whose Irish accent badly wants to be closed
for alterations and repairs. But even with all
these drawbacks the drama is a good, upstanding
horror, and ought to pull through successfully.
* * * & ■■
“Captain Fritz,” produced on Saturday
night at Sydney Criterion, is a sketchy concern,
which consists mostly of a German captain’s
foreign accent in five acts. It goes with a certain
dash and glitter, and it is only when it is over
that one begins to realise how little there is in it.
The German captain is “Hans the Boatman”
over again in an elegant blue uniform, but other-
wise unchanged. He has the same accent, the
same desire to play at horses with the children,
the same ingenuous smile, but unluckily he hasn’t
the same songs. Hans’s melodies were thin
enough, but they were bright and tuneful, while
those of Captain Fritz are thin, but several of
them are not tuneful to any startling extent.
“The Cracksman’s Chant ” and “ My Pipe and I ”
are good, especially the former; but the tale, in
irregular metre, of the “ Woolly Bear” is a thing
of wailing and general execration. A good part
of the time the comedy is entirely occupied in
leading up to one of Mr. Arnold’s songs, and a
good deal more of it concerns itself with a child in
a preternaturally brief kilt and two attenuated legs.
Altogether, “Fritz” aims at being a simple, pasto-
ral sort of item, with an atmosphere of German
beer-sentiment spread over it, and a kind of flowery
romance scattered round promiscuously. There is
enough good material in it to make an excellent
comedy of half the length, and the other half
mostly concerns itself with the small boy in the
kilt, and the reckless manner in which he adapts
the German captain for use as a gee-gee, or a puff-
puff, or something equally thrilling.
# • #
Mr. Arnold, as the aforesaid captain, is
a glorious and beautiful mash in his blue uniform,
and partly on account of the uniform, and partly
on account of the wearer’s undoubted capabilities,
the thin little story gets through with remark-
able success. In fact, it is only when one draws
a fancy picture of it without Mr. Arnold and his
uniform, and his general light-heartedness, and
the constant vision of his blue coat-tails flying
round after the child in the abbreviated kilt that
the thinness of it becomes really apparent. The
rest of the co. fill a quantity of more or less
.sketchy characters with reasonable success. A
certain wild slavey called Dinah Wurzle, as repre-
sented by Miss Ada Lee, is particularly excellent,
and another slab of warm commendation is hereby
bestowed on Mr. Percy Brough, as a British cor-
poral. The balance of the cast keeps up to a
respectable standard, with the possible exception
of a long individual who has a disjointed tale to
tell about being the long-lost brother of a person
who has no material connection with the story.
Sydney Royal re-opens on Saturday with
Dan Tracey’s minstrel and variety show. The
show is said to be a big and comprehensive affair,
but it is a lamentable fall for the grand old
theatre, none the less, when it comes down to be
the haunt of the burnt-cork humorist, and “Mr.
Johnson,” the centre-man, who abets him in his
conundrums.
** * *
The Lyceum spectacle—which will last for
another week—remains very much as it was,
except that Caicedo now balances an Austrian
chair on two of its thin hind legs upon the wire, and
then balances himself on one of his own legs on
the chair. This reckless proceeding is received
with the warmest approbation. Rumour vaguely
asserts that Caicedo intends, by-and-bye, to take
his dinner with him when he goes up, and eat it
on a table which is balanced upon one leg on the
wire, but this statement requires further corro-
boration, or corrobboree, or something,

Maggie Moore’s season at Melbourne Royal
opened cheerfully on Saturday night. “ The
Golden Giant” belongs to a large family of ’Mnrkan
mining plays, the heroine whereof is generally de-
scribed as a rough diamond, though, properly
speaking, she is a nigged nugget. In the present
instance this perennial young heroine is known as
Bet, and naturally enough she marries a gambler,
who proves the first case on record of a gambler
becoming converted by winning a Bet. That
Maggie Moore is the soul of the piece goes with-
out saying, but when said the fact may be
left to speak for itself. Augustus Glover, as
the giant, runs a good second to the leading
lady, aptitude for bringing out all the nobility of
the mining character whose whiteness owes no-
thing to soap being Augustus’s strong point.
Stewart, junr,, makes a satisfactory clean-looking
villain, and the gallery, educated to believe that
washing is the first step to crime in regions where
the emblem of virtue is a “pick,’’ howls at him
considerably after each act. Miss Constance
Deorwyn figures as a persecuted widow, also little
Dora Taylor, who is less young than she appears,
figures in a clever dance. Some of the others are
not so uniformly satisfactory as the scenery of
“ The Golden Giant,” whiph will, no doubt, adorn
the boards for a fortnight At least,
“ The Mountebanks,” givdn with more
effect than aforetime in several little matters,
crowded the Princess’ on Saturday. The late
Alfred Cellier is said to have specially written
the part of Teresa for Miss 'Nellie Stewart, a
mystifying statement seeing that W. S. Gilbert
wrote the libretto whilst Cellier endeavoured (not
very successfully) to catch the musical inspiration
of the words. But Gilbert must have had some-
body very like Nellie Stewart in his eye
when he drew the character in question.
Her one fault has virtues peculiarly .its. own
when she comes to act the affected village beauty,
and she is altogether a first-class Teresa. Tapley,
as the richly-decorated farmer, is a successful
novelty in Melbourne, but two other important
changes from the opening cast —Miss Cameron in
Ida Osborne’s former place, and Miss Osborne in
Flora Graupner’s—don’t count much for the
better, because each lady is a little too big for her
part. They give fresh interest to the opera, how-
ever, and “The Mountebank” is a work which
needs all the interest it can get. On Saturday
they start a week of “ Mikado,”
** * *
“ After Dark ” had a first week of bloated
prosperity at the Alexandra, but in consideration
of drama having sprung up at the Royal, this
well-timed show will be hauled down on Saturday
and replaced by a new excitement. Seeing that
Dan Barry’s treasury is overflowing with small
silver it would have been wise, perhaps, to buy 3
heavier class of engine for the important railway
scene. A cardbdard locomotive hitched to )
couple of pigmy carriages is not much of a sigh
for the gods, neither does Dan remote the drugged
gentleman from the track in a istjHe that makes
one tremble for hia safety. Too evidently he ia
concerned for the welfare of the train,"which
would topple ignominiously into the orchestra if
a couple of live men came in contact with its mid
rush across the stage. Otherwise “After Dark”
is a well-mounted and lively entertainment. T.ie
bill for next Saturday is “Right’s Right,” a
refreshing title. In the everyday life of Ml*
bourne, Right’s left —badly left—as a rule.

English notices of Amy Sherwin say nothing about the
strange uncertainty of her voice. In Australia this much-
lauded lady sang sometimes like an angel and sometimes

FranK Clark got married the other day to a respected
little member of the Melb. bar. The deed was done, they
say, immediately after the settlement of that interesting
maintenance-case, which had chastened the erring corner-
man and turned his thoughts to the calm joys of matri-
mony,
Clara Merivale’s husband is flourishing at Coolgardie>
and Ernest Brodribb, of Titan celebrity, has an interest
in the same claim. The spec, looks so promising that
Mr. “Merivale” is itching to start another comic opera
show, lest he may become too rich. Brodribb dreams ol
buying more racehorses and breaking the ring, most
likely.
Talk of European preparations for war has brought on
a new crop of jingo songs at the London ’alls, whence
the shop-boys totter home to roost hiccupping, “Ilshtime
we had’nother Waterloosh, shelpmeGawdiiish 1” The
grand, old, bloated fat man, who used to declare that he
was full of bone and muscle, and if ever there was a
tussle they would find his name to be John Bull—he is
dead now, unfortunately. But perhaps another human
beer-barrel comes rolling on in his stead, beating his
corporation, like a gorilla, in defiance of the French, and
bellowing equal to ten Bulls.

his head would be thrown back and his terrible jaws fall

violently as to cause his enormous ear-flaps to smite
together across his yawning chasm of a mouth with a

At Sydney, last week, Robert Mills,
charged with shooting to murder his paramour,
Martha Uemsley, but found guilty only of shoot-

Mills was jealous of a Chinaman. Judge VVin-
deyer preached a long and boisterous, not to say
abusive, sermon to Mills, but his Honor might
just as well have saved his breath. All the talk
that ever came from beneath horsehair won’t alter
the fact that jealousy is the Dipsomania of Love.
When a Judge is able to put down the jim-jams by
talk, then, and then only, will judicial sermons put
down jealousy and the various suicidal and homici-
dal consequences thereof. Meet the right woman,
and you will be drunk with love—drunk and
happy; meet the wrong woman and you will be
drunk (and disorderly) with love, and Judge
Windeyer, if the jury won’t let him divorce your
soul from your body, will send you up for 15 years,

horrid tone of voice.
The Wild Cat Column.
What is the exact point where judicious reserve
ends and absolute cram begins? This question is sug-
gested by an item In the dismal history of the Anglo-
Australian Investment, Finance, and Land Co. (Sydney).
When that co. had built its magnificent white elephant,
the Australia Hotel, the board made the following
announcement; “ The directors have pleasure in inform-
ing the shareholders of the completion and sale of the
Australia Hotel. An independent co. has been formed
for the purpose of working the hotel in which this co, is
largely interested." It is now announced that out of
297,000 shares in the aforesaid independent company the
Anglo-Australian Co. held 296,300, and the other 700
were held by its six directors and manager, at the rate of
100 each 1 Therefore, the Anglo-Australian held, to all
reasonable intents and purposes, as much of the hotel as
ever it did; it hadn’t sold the hotel, except to
itself; the alleged sale wasn’t to an “independent”
company; and the impression created that the Anglo-
Australian had got rid of some appreciable portion of its
liability was altogether incorrect and misleading. In-
stead of doing that it had vastly increased its risks, for
the hotel, as a nominally separate concern, might pass out
of its hands and into those of an official liquidator, in
which case the latter person could call on the Finance Co.
for £148,150 unpaid capital on its lost property. The
fact that the hotel co. shares are now about to
be forfeited for unpaid calls is a sufficient proof of this ; if
the big caravanserai hadn’t been sold to an “independent
co.” it might have brought the Anglo-Australian some
£150,000 at auction, whereas now it promises to be an
absolute and hopeless loss. The Anglo-Australian could
gain nothing by creating the alleged “independent com-
pany ’’—which was really itself; and unless it was done to
grossly deceive somebody there was no reason for it
that is perceptible to any ordinary intelligence. There-
fore, the influential citizens who controlled the board of
the dead institution might do some hard, voluminous
explanation just here, with advantage to themselves
and others.

The reconstructed Australian Deposit and Mort-
gage Bank (Melbourne) has just managed to scrape
together sufficient to pay 2J per cent, per annum to pre-
ference shareholders. The ordinary shareholders get.
nothing, and, considering that they don’t get anything
till the preference crowd have received 6 per cent, they
will probably remain as they are for several years to come.
An interesting statement by the directorate is that it
“has refrained from bringing to the profit and loss
account any sum which they did not think they were
entitled to take credit for." Which, so far as one can
see, only means that they have abstained from telling
fibs in the balance-sheet, and have the cheek to make
special mention of the fact.

For crass idiotcy commend us to the bank which
notifies a number of small traders that the debts (amount-
ing to £lOOO in all) due to one of the bank’s customers
(owing the bank over £50,000 unsecured; must be paid to
the bank direct. The bank ruins its customer’s credit,
and, so to say, kills the goose that might.eventually lay
the golden egg.

A British insolvent who had fled to Australia
with about £lOOO of his creditors’ money was fool enough
to confide the fact to a southern solicitor whom he had
commissioned to make out an agreement for the purchase
of a business. The purchase-money (£450; was deposited
with the solicitor, who also held the signed agreement.
Delay in payment of the purchase-money evoked a protest
from the vendor, and a stormy interview between pur-
chaser and solicitor ended in insolvent having to hand
over to his legal adviser the balance of the plunder (£550)
to avert a threatened cable to insolvent’s English creditors
as to insolvent’s whereabouts.

Editor Bulletin, —Your correspondent “Insur-
ance ” should have designated himself “ Assurance," and
he would have been warranted in putting a hyphen
after the first three letters of the word. Commenting on
the par. relative to the policy on the late W. 11. Beers,
in the Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York, which
appeared in your issue of Feb. 17, he makes out that the
insured paid, in premiums, nearly double the face-value
of the policy, and had, therefore, secured for his estate
only two per cent, compound interest on his outlay.
The facts are that he paid in premiums altogether
£l9l os. Bd., and his heirs received £538, or about 4J per
cent, compound interest. In other words, his investment
was as good as if he had put his money in a savings
bank, with insurance for £2OO thrown in from the
moment the first annual premium of £4 6s. lOd. was paid.
A sufficiently “ wonderful ” return, “ when worked out."
Your correspondent seems to have obtained his idea of
the amount of “premiums paid” by deducting the
overplus of bonus additions above premiums, viz.,
£146 19s. 4d. from the total claim £538, without taking
into account the balance of bonus additions. If this
exhibits the extent of his knowledge of the subject it
augurs badly for the welfare of any insurance-office with
which he may be connected.—Justitia
* * *
The glory of beer has departed. M'Cracken’s
City Brewery Co. (Melb.) pays no div. this year, it
swallows up the last £5OOO of its reserve-fund, and it
can’t even provide the annual payment of £l5OO towards
wiping off preliminary expenses. Next year there will be
no reserve-fund left to absorb, and then, unless there is a
great beer-resurrect on in the interval—and there are no
signs of it at present—something dreadful is going to
happen. Meanwhile the shares (£1 paid up, with a 10s.
liability) can be got for about nothing, or less, it anyone
wants them badly.

Melb. Metropolitan Board of Works originally
paid £l7OO a year rent for offices in the “Rialto,”
Collins-street. The landlord has recently reduced his
charge 10 per cent., but some members of the Board con-
sider that £lOOO a year would fully meet the case. Others
protest that the premises are “dirt cheap” at the
reduced price, £1530. These differences of opinion rage
around the value of all real property in Melbourne. To
those who estimate the value of houses by what it won d
cost to replace them, it seems that rents are generally
low just now. Whereas tenants who have aiop;ed the
old capitalistic dogma relating to supply and demand
laugh at the landlord who calls his houses cheap to-day
because (hey were so infernally dear a few years ago.
The value of town property is governed by population.

The twice-reconstructed Standard Bank of Aus-
tralia held a tearful meeting last week and presented an
emaciated balance-sheet as a monument of its own hope-
lessness. Last time the Standard reconstructed, a kind-
hearted Judge granted permission to defer payment of
the first half year’s interest on d -posits till the end of
the year, and, judging from the balance-sheet, if it had
not been for this blessed reprieve the bank would now be
burst for the third time and busy over another recon-
struction. The expenses of the last resurrection are
mostly still unpaid, and after allowing for the postponed
interest there is a small loss. If things improve
a little next half-year, the interest on deposits will pre-
sumably be paid; if they don’t improve, the bank will
presumably burst some more at an early date. The
directors announce that they have charged no interest
whatever on many of the accounts, which plainly means
that there is no present hope of collecting the interest
if it was charged. When there is no visible hope
of collecting the interest, the public can estimate
for itself the chances of collecting the principal.
How many of the accounts are in this abject stale is
not explained, but if the amount of the profits is any
criterion it would seem probable that half the Standard’s
alleged assets consist of eminently doubtful debts. Also,
out of the interest actually charged, about £9OOO “has
been placed to a suspense account until the exact position
of the relative advances can be ascertained." From
this it would seem that there are two gradations of
doubtful debts. The first consists of the advances which
are so hopeless that the co. can’t charge interest upon
them; the second of the advances (apparently about
£lOO,OOO or so), which are good enough to charge
interest upon and yet so bad that the com-
pany doesn’t dare to count with any confidence
on getting the interest after it is charged. Nobody even
ventures to mention the remote possibility of a dividend,
and the depositors’ view of the general rottenness of
things can he estimated by the fact that deposits are
offering at ss. 9d. and finding no buyers. As for the
shares, any speculative enthusiast could probably get
about a quarter of the bank for the trouble of taking it
away.
The Standard was twice reconstructed without
any independent audit of its affairs. Judging by present
appearances it wants an independent audit just as badly
as do many other banks.

Dear Sir,—I am in receipt of yours dated 15th

Mo. —, drawn by your friend in the big receni
Brisbane lottery consists of a 16-perch allotment in the
Park estate. It is situated about six miles froir
Brisbane, in a poor suburb. In my opinion, it might be
worth £lO, twenty-five years hence. At present, how-
ever, nobody would give anything for it, and it will cost
£2 to £3 to get a title to the land. As sopn as your
friend gets it in Iris name the rates will commence. You
ask my advice. Have nothing to do with it. The Deposit
Bank doesn’t give cash for any of its prizes. The object
of the lottery was to get rid of the land they couidn’*
dispose of. Congratulating your friend on his glitteriugly
good luck,—Yours most sincerely, .

David Gaunson, on behalf of Millidge, pro-

pay it, and stopped payment on the third day, and did not
re-open till reconstructed, would the directors, if prose-
cuted, be held to have known, when they declared a div.,
that the bank was insolvent ? ” His Honor evaded direct
responsibility of reply by opining that the burden would
be thrown upon the directors to show the cause of
collapse. That a lawyer should dare to ask such a half-
veiled question as the above is a telling indication of the
rottenness of Australian banking laws.

When the M‘Donnell (S.A.) ranges rubies were
first found, a parcel of them was sold in London for big
money ; but they have since been consistently cried down,
by certain leading experts, as not true stones. “Alaman-
dine garnets" is the term of opprobrium applied to
them. Yet, it is declared that though there are lots of
such (and other) garnets in the ranges, there are likewise
many true rubies (the ruby is the dearest of precious
stones) which, when found, are bought cheap and sent to
Asia, where they are repacked—and sold in the London
market without any nasly Australian mark. The ruby
trade is almost a monopoly, and prices would slumo on
the opening of an Australian field.

A CHRONICLE OF THE TIME.
JONES: “If water was so scarce at Coolgardie, how did you wash
your clothes ? ”
SMITH (a returned miner) : “We didn’t, we used to dry-blow them ! ”
JONES: “ And how about baths ?”
SMITH: “ Well, I once asked the publican for a bath, and he said,
‘Which will you have—beer or water? They’re the
same price.’ ”
Premier Kingston, had he not been
educated for the law, would have made a bril-
liant “ lightning calculator.” The writer has seen
him perform a clever arithmetical feat. Giving
the different letters forming the words “ South
Australian Railways” a separate value, Kingston
recently essayed to state the total value of any
collection of these letters as fast as they could be
named, and in no case did he fail. The S.A.
Premier has long been famed for his remarkable
memory.
The Victorian Civil servant who appears
to have absconded with about £l2OO of public
money is a striking example of the folly of the
average embezzler. He had been in the service
27 years, was in receipt of a salary of £485, and,
had he retired, would have been entitled to a pen-

Yet he sacrificed all this, and more.
London Figaro, deluding itself with the
idea that it is getting off a democratic sentiment,
says : “ The Duchess of York has very properly
handed the purse of £lOOO which were subscribed
by men of the army when she was married to the
Royal Cambridge Asylum for Officers’ Widows.”
Tommy Atkins, on tenpence a day, contributes
his trifle to—the support of his late capting’s lady !
W. G. Spence, President of the Shearers’
Union, is from the Orkney Isles in the remote
North of Scotland, Like most prominent Demo-
crats, he is a chronic teetotaller. The Tory press,
in its alleged humorous moments, always repre-
sents the Democrat as having but one yearning—
a yearning after beer, but nowadays the sodden
and beery men are all on its own side of the
House.
A Lily dale (Vic.) publican, an old local
identity, grows tooth-crops ad infinitum. He is
over 70 years of age and no sooner loses a tooth
than another grows in its place. His son has the
same peculiarity. It is clearly the duty of the
Patterson Govt, to see that this strain is carefully
bred from, with a view to the ultimate abolition
of dentists, who as a purse-curse to the human
race can only be compared with plumbers.
The coming 10th March will be the cen-
tenary of the arrival in Australasia of Rev. Samuel
Marsden, the first Apostle of the Maoris. A
grandson of missionary Marsden (born in Sydney)
was Bishop of Bathurst (N.S.W.) from ’O9 to ’B5,
and is still alive in England. The original Mars-
den was an amiable old gentleman who more than
once sat on the bench at Parramatta and ordered
men to be flogged because they refused to confess
to theft.
John Alex. M’Pherson, who, by accident,
was Yic. Chief Secretary for a few months in
1809-70, has died in London. He was the first to
give office to Graham Berry, who was Treasurer
for less than three months. Other members of the
short-lived Govt., now dead, were R. Byrne, M.
A. M'Donnell, J. G. Reeves, Ed. Cohen, J. T.
Smith, B. C. Aspinall, and C. J. Jenner. The
only survivors are long M‘Kean, Wm. M'Lellan,
and Francis Longmore.
The late John Woods once hit the just-
dead (N.S.W.-horn) Vic. ex-Premier, J. A. Mac-
pherson, very hard. He admitted that Australian
natives might some day become useful legislators,
“but,” said he, “in our Parliament we have, as
yet, only had three ; and of these, one is a fugitive
on the Pacific coast, one enjoys Her Majesty’s
hospitality at Pentridge Gaol, and one is Her
Majesty’s Minister for Lands.” Woods’ words
cost him dear when the “ native vote ” began to
tell.
Fitz william Wentworth’s eldest son (a
B. of New College, Oxford) has just passed
with credit his law exam, at the Middle Temple,
and will go to the bar. As he intends to practise
in Sydney, the historical name of W. C. Went-
worth will once more appear on the rolls of the
N.S.W. Supreme Court. Mr. Wentworth does
not intend his sons to lead idle and useless lives
like so many scions of the rich. One of his boys
is being trained as a wool-classer, another is study
ing as a mining engineer, and a fourth, now at
college, is to be an electrician.

A totally blind man, Ambrose Hallen, of
Toongabbie, is a parliamentary candidate for
Sherbrooke, N.S.W. It is said that Hallen walks
from Toongabbie to Parramatta, and all around
the latter town, without any guide. That is
understandable. It is also stated that he plays a ,
fair game of cricket, and bowls with good judg-,
ment. That is a transparent fib* of a low order..
One Leslie Murray Robertson, a witness.-,
in the famous Ardlamont murder case, is said to,
be the identical Eton schoolboy who, years, ago,
broke his umbrella on the lunatic who threatened)
to shoot Queen Victoria. Salmon Wilson’s sou.
has been a person of fame for years past, on the
assumption that he was the umbrella-smasher of
that bygone episode, but it would seem that
history is wrong again.
Mr. Bloomfield, owner of the crack Auck-
land yacht, Viking, which beat the Sydney flier,
the Volunteer, the other day, has had a far from
uneventful life. With his mother and his
brothers he was among the few survivors of the
horrible Poverty Bay (M.L.) massacre, in 1808,,
when over 80 of their fellow settlers were slain by’
Te-Kooti. The Bloomfield family, almost ruinedl
by the Maori troubles, lived for several years in a
state of penury, but when Captain Reid, their
uncle, died, he left the boys .£lOO,OOO.
Colonel Tom Price, of Melbourne, was;
lately summoned at the instance of a common
policeman for driving a horse and buggy on the
wrong side of the road without reasonable cause.
A dreadful change from the time when a mere
word from the Colonel would have been the signal
for the laying-out of a crowd of proletarian
corpses ! In those days he mig(it have driven on
both sides of the road at once, and also in the
middle, and nobody would have dared to dispute
his right. Victoria, and the provinces generally
for that matter, will soon be no fit place of
residence for military men who have any self-
respect. The sooner the better.

The Victorian Government has commuted
the death-sentence on William Burnett to 15 years
penal servitude. Burnett’s crime was the shoot-
ing, with fatal effect, of a youth who interfered
with him when he was beating bis mother. The
ordinary murderer, if he isn’t hanged, gets a life
sentence, but the fact that Burnett was beating
his mother probably appealed to the Patterson
Government as an extenuating circumstance.
Latest suggestion re Kanaka traffic. That
depots be formed on the islands, and steamers be
run for Kanaka transport from July to December
—the boys being returned at the end of the season.
“ Then,” adds a N.Q. paper, “ the boys will re-
cuperate during the slack season, and the danger
of depopulating the islands will be avoided.”
(Apparently the Kanaka is to be sent home to
propagate.) “This system may in time be ex-
tended to New Guinea.”

Victorian voters are urged by “ a Christian

possible ! Nearly all the Vic. men of character

boom aftermath —in fact, Victorian “character”
is so badly injured about the midriff that there
would be almost a chance of starting a Sunday

Dear Bulletin, —The
last Queensland J.P. list
contains many names of per-
sons who have filed schedules
during the last twelve months
—some only three months
ago. The intermittent J.P.
is quite a feature in Queens-
land. Periodically he stops
payment, in order to add
another stratum to his un-
earned increment. He resigns
his commission temporarily.
When matters are “ wound-
up in liquidation, and not in
insolvency,” his collabora-
tors, or co-directors, or fel-
low-conspirators exert their
influence, and he duly blos-
soms a J.P. in the next list
gazetted. As he is always a
shining example of thrift, a
bulwark of property, and a
supporter of law and order,
his performance is repeated
ad infinitum. —Yours, Na-
tive Minee.
From General Labourers’ Union report
read at Intercolonial Conference, Sydney, Febru-
ary, 1894:
The laundry established by the G.L.U. at Newtown*
Sydney, has to compete with a keen competition, which
cuts prices too low to pay. Although most persons talk
in favour of co operation, we find that they do nothing to
help in a practical way. It is also a sad fact that amongst
the list of customers we only find three unionists. Until
men do instead of talk, we shall have no success in co-
operation or anything else calculated to raise humanity.
Will every unionist paste this in his hat?

severe punishment those horrible corrupters of
infancy who sell “ prize packets ” of lollies at Id.
each. Melbourne is coming down with several
thuds on the hokey-pokey men who dare to sell
their sticky wares on the Sawbath. Sydney is
being gnawed at by the Council of the Churches,
who want to conflagrate the music-halls and
aquariums that give “ secular ” music on the Sab-
bath—altogether, Australians are getting too
beastly good for this hemisphere. But, thank
heaven ! in every one of the capitals named, it is
easier to get a drink than a dinner on a Sunday.
Haynes, M.P. (N.S.W.), was advocating
late parliamentary trams, because many hon.
members couldn’t afford cabs. Traill (the analy-
tical Traill): “And if they stay in town, what
will their wives say ?” i
The reply is a fan,
Maybe peace, maybe strife—
It depends on the man ; •
It depends on the wife.
To the true give the crown, ■
To the false fling the gold ;
When the man is in town,
P’raps the wife is consoled?
The Q. Government’s risk in making
Advances for trams and mills under the Sugar
Works Guarantee Act is dangerously increased
by the recent repeal of the sixth clause of the
regulations, providing for the deposit, in cash, of
one-tenth of the proposed cost of a central mill, as
a security for hona fides. There is now only |
the valuator to depend on. But if the crops of *
companies under this Act increase much more,
the margin of the Australian and only certain
market for sugar will soon be supplied. An export
trade is dubious, while the bounty-fed beetroot
article competes as at present.
THE CAT.
The wild cat beasts at human feasts
Provided by the old time priests,
Ate every morsel clean.

It will not touch a bit of Pat,

Mr. Henry Heylyn Hayter
Thk snVvoined portrait represents r Mr. Henry
Hts.ylvu Hayter, C.M.G., Govt. Statistician of Vic-
toria, ■who is about to leave the service at the
age of 72. Mr. Hayter is being retired, not
because his mental or bodily vigour shows any
symptoms of decline, for he is as youthful as are
ordinary men of 55, and more so than many
of only 50. Ho is being dispensed with simply
because he is 72. Mr. Hayter, like astro-
nomer Ellery and ootanist Von Mueller, is a
wnole-scaled enthusiast in his work, and
would gladly go on till he dies in harness, if
a bull-headed Cabinet would so permit. The
chances of finding an equally efficient statistician
to succeed him are limited, for men of his
ability and devotedness are rare. The Bulletin,
recognising the fact that Mr. Hayter leads a
double life, has decided to divide his portrait into
two chapters. The first is the intellectual and
business part of Hayter, and the retirement of this
end of him is a matter for profound regret. The
second instalment is the poetic and C.M.G. por
tion of the man—the one which wears a Windsor
uniform and a mass of decorations —and This
Bulletin views the superannuation of this end with
complete indifference. This latter portion of the
otherwise eminent Hay ter can be replaced at any
time, but if the Government can be induced to re-
consider its decision and allow the upper extremity
of the gentleman to continue in the service, it
will be a distinct benefit to the country which the
said upper end of him has served so long and so
efficiently.
An effort is being made in Orange,
N.S.W., to throw open the municipal billets,
from road-man up to town-clerk, to public tender!
Kipling (in “The Amir’s Homily”) on
Afghan camel-drivers : “To the Afghan neither
life, property, law, nor kingship are sacred when
his own lusts prompt him to rebel. He is a (thief
by instinct, a murderer by heredity and training,
and frankly and bestially immoral by all three.”
Mr. William W. Brown, Inspector W. and S.
Board, Gowrie-Street, Newtown, who writes on
Dec. 28th, 1892";—For about two years I have
been a severe sufferer from biliousness and indi-
gestion, with constant attacks‘ of dizziness ; in
fact I have been at times incapacitated from fol-
lowing my daily avocations as a Government
Inspector. At times when seized with dizziness
I have had to ait down to keep myself from falling.
Hearing so much about the nerve strengthening
■qualities of Clements Tonic I resolved to give it a
trial, which I have done with the most beneficial
results. I had only taken two bottles when I found
myself thoroughly cured. lam only too happy
to add my testimony to the number already re-
ceived.—Wishing you every success, and a happy
new year, I remain, yours gratefully, William W.

Various branches of the Australian Natives’ Association
have resolved —“ That some form of regalia or sash
smihr to other friendly societies’ be introduced into this
association, to be worn by members at public demonstra-

Gaily turns the young man’s fancy
To the gaudy-coloured sash
That will thrill the heart of Nancy
And accelerate a mash.
In his suit of tweed and topper
Tompkins, of the A.N.A.,

A state of things that’s far from proper,
So the leading memhahs say.
So they want a pretty feather
Public envy to coerce
When they demonstrate together
Or procesh behind a hearse.
They’re not particularly clever—
Not quite mental Brobdingnags.
Thus it is with “bodies ” ever—•
Wanting brains, they will endeavour
To make up with flaunting rags.

Eighty divorce cases on the list for the
N.S.W. divorce hearings, and 80 percent, of these
Slave the wives as petitioners. Nearly all of the
cases are under the Divorce Extension Act.
Joseph Johnson, ex-sec-
fjtary of Melbourne Per-
manent Building Society,
sentenced last Friday to two
yt ars in gaol for the usual big
'embezzlement, put in a plea
for consideration on the
ground that he had been for
many years “a respected
'citizen.” They are all respected
citizens, and it is only an
aggravation of the offence.
The respect is fraudulently
acquired as well as the money,
and a man who has stolen
the cash is no more entitled
to consideration because he
id o obtained the good opinion
of his friends by false pretences
than he would be if he had
also obtained a suit of clothes
by false pretences. Still, the
plea was accepted in this in-
stance as in most others, and
Johnson (an old man) got an
unusually light sentence ac-
c irdingly. Being “ a respected
citizen” he had a tolerably
good time of it before, and fur
this reason the law lets him
have as good a time as it can
now.

A Sydney lady, well-

and discussing methods of
getting possession of it before
the serewing-down of the

“Barmaids, musical, for
West Australia.” — Melb. advt.
How about wagers laid that Matthew
Davies would never tiave to stand a trial in Melb.
Criminal Court? The criminal charge against
Davies and others is being heard in the Banco
Court. At the outset “the defendants were con-
ducted to special seats provided in the body of the
hall, but at a subsequent stage they were per-
mitted to place themselves near to their legal
advisers,” There is not even an aroma of Criminal
Court attached to these very special proceedings.
The Bulletin hopes to see this precedent fol-
lowed. It is sheer brutality to put an uncon-
victed man behind the spikes.

Irving has shown his contempt for vulgar
superstition by enrolling himself as a member of
the London Thirteen Club, which seems to think
that by dining together once a year it can break
down an ancient superstition. The members of
the club are to dine in room No. 13 at Holborn
Restaurant. There will be 13 cross-eyed waiters ;
the entrance to the room will be under a ladder ;
there will be 13 courses; salt will be spilt in 13
places on the table; and though much liquor
will, of course, be consumed, the members,
instead of taking wine with each other, will say,
“ May I spill salt with you?” These and other
childish things will constitute the main entertain-
ment. It is to be hoped, for the sake of the
company, that there will not be thirteen toasts.
The superstition as to 13 diners received a
remarkable illustration a few years ago. When
Searle, the sculler, was leaving London for Sydney,
Henniker Heaton gave a small dinner in his
honour at St. Stephen’s Club. About 16 or 17
were invited, but only 13 accepted. Heaton then
asked a friend, who was assisting him to arrange
the dinner, to invite one or two more. He did so,
and one accepted, making the 14. When the
guests assembled it was found that only 12 had
turned up, and Henniker, who is most supersti-
tious, was in dread that another would arrive at
any moment. The company sat down 12 strong, but
just as the oysters were being discussed word was
brought that Mr. (the writer forgets his name
for the moment—he was editor of the Chronicle)
was down-stairs and would like to be carried up,
as he suffered from palpitation of the heart. Here
was another dilemma, and Heaton asked his
friend to go down and hunt the club to find
another guest, but no one was available. A jolly
evening was spent and the fateful number was
quite forgotten. But within 12 months both
Searle and the editor of the Chronicle were dead.

A Sydney solicitor last week left on his

In Sydney nowadays, when a death is
announced, a mouldy-looking little man, dressed
in rusty-black with white snail-tracks along the
seams, presently comes round to the back door of
the bereaved family and wants to sell mourning-
cards with little bits of doggerel on them. They
are the same old doggerel every time —“Dearest
mother, we have missed you,” and things like
that. The apologetic little ghoul who carries
them sidles apologetically in at the back gate and
treads lightly on his broken boots down the path
to the back door, and there he softly takes off his
crape-bound hat and wipes away the tear of hired
affliction with a cotton handkerchief of murky
hue, and produces his wares. Then, lest any of
their beauties should be lost upon his hearer, he
reads them aloud in a husky tone, and emphasises
the more touching passages with an unscavengered
finger-nail. And he is so limp and persuasive,
IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
1ST EMANCIPATED ONE: “By-the-way, old girlie, I haven't
seen your husband lately.”
2ND DO. DO. : “Well, the fact is I’m without a servant just
now, and he can’t get out much. The last slavey-man
we had was such a lazy good-for-nothing.”
and so gently sorrowful, that you presently feel as
if the death had occurred in his family instead of
your own, and you buy a half-crown’s worth of
literary awfulness out of sympathy. Whereupon
he thanks you in the same husky whisper, and
takes off the midnight hat again with another
profound reverence, and mops himself up a second
time with the murky cotton handkerchief, and
steals away.

In New Guinea, under the pious adminis-

attempting to foretell the future by divination
will get three months gaol with hard labour. Yet,
m Australia, the diviner and the trance-medium

the rest boom prodigiously and though their
addresses can be found any day in the Evening

Strange that the churches give so little

Despite published denials, it is a solemn
fact that an eminent S.A. lawyer charged the
captain of the ocean-liner in which he recently
travelled to Australia, fees (over £2O) for con-
versations at sea—between Colombo and Albany—
which the captain believed to be informal. The
captain avers that the lawyer never told him that
the conversations were official; however, he had
to pay (under threat of writ), as he could not afford
to fight the matter at the risk of detention. At
the bottom of the trouble, of course, were several
ladies —who were quarrelling among themselves.

matised as pimp. Nowadays he comes under the

Dear Bulletin, — Women do dislike beards

Latter-day Adventists, Social Gimletists, and
other holy cranks and faddists; and women, young

TO THE LADIES.
It is generally admitted that you, ladies, have on
your shoulders the responsibility of the household,
and the care of providing for the welfare, at home,
of your husbands and the children.
You no doubt act up to the best of your abilities,
and yet there is one pertinent question which we
should bke to ask you.
Do you give your children a drink
OUT OF THE TAP
when they are thirsty 7
If you do, you are running a fearful risk, especially
in the country, of bringing unwelcome visitors into
your home.
Typhoid and Hydatids
Are very prevalent just now in Sydney, and half the
cases are brought on by drinking unfiltered water.
Now, in making up your mind to purchase a filter
at once, there is just one thing to beware of —ar.d
that is the old-fashioned Sponge or Carbon Filters;
and one thing to remember—that since the water in
Sydney is deficient in lime, the best filter to buy is
A LIMESTONE FILTER.
Let nothing induce you to buy any other kind. If
you do, you will be sorry.
(Tobin & (gavidson’s “ <§apid”
LIMESTONE FILTER is the best in the world.
It obtained
fiust rum:
at the late Chicago Exposition, and costs, in the
small size, only 10s. 6d.
Only lOa. 6ci.
For 10s. 6d. you can fulfil a grave duty, and dis-
charge a serious responsibility.
Order through your local storekeeper, or, if in
town, call at our Show-rooms, 393 George-street,
opposite Royal Hotel.
A line from you will bring our illustrated circular,
telling you all about it. [Mention this paper, we
want to test its value.]

The senile masher has struck anew patch.
Haunting the steps of G.P.O. he scrutinizes the
faces of the passing female show until he notes a
pleasing countenance, and then, with_ the polite-
ness of the ancien regime, he introduces himself as an
artist—save the mark. With profuse apologies
he explains thatheis wanting “ just such a face, and
to pourtray that delicate and refined countenance
in undying pigments is the one necessity for
finishing his great picture”—of Helen of Troy,
Andromeda, Titania, Marion de I’Orme, or
Marguerite de Valois—according to the type of
girldom addressed. Sometimes the victim is
caught on this skilfully-hidden hook of vanity;
bnt'uow and then the artist is led on to an un-
v ■■ isant interview with a Herculean husband.

Annie Rostron, aged 70, walked from
Melbourne to Ballarat, 90 odd miles, last week, to
get into the local “ Benevolent.” “In Melbourne
old folks are treated as rubbish,” said Annie,
“ but in Ballarat, I hear, you treat ’em as ladies.”
The Bench told the venerable heroine that they
could not get her into the asylum, but they would
send her to gaol if she pleased. The old woman
objected, saying she would walk back to Mel-
bourne, and at latest her bonnet was seen nodding
through the dust on the Melb. road. It is time
woman got her rights : Annie Rostron is worth a
score we could select from any Australian Upper
House.

(confession) night. Crowd close to confessional,
from which emerges well-known J.P. Two old
women crowding for next turn. The priest comes
forth to decide who is entitled to priority. “ How
long are you here, Mrs. Maginnis?” “Tin
minits at laste, your reverence.” “And you,
Mrs. O’Brien?” “Simre I’m bin here much
longer, father dear.” “How long?” “Well,
iver since M'Gaire there” (pointing to the J.P.)
“towld ye he shtole the boots !”

Duncan Gillies, taking one long, last feed
at Melb. Town Hall, paid a tribute to the energy,
perseverance, and general usefulness of civic dig-
nitaries : “I can only say that all the time I
have had the opportunity, for many years past, of
being present at these luncheons, and especially
the annual ones, the Mayors of Melbourne have
always done their duty as the head of the citizens
of this great city.”
The latest Tasmanian elopement has pro-
vided Hobart Shakespeare Society with the spirit
of a real live heroine —though the committee was
last year of opinion that the lady was too shy and
retiring and lacked the pre-eminent natural
characteristics of a Juliet, Rosalind, or Jessica.
He was a much-married Gratiano.

At a recent Hobart society ball the prin-
cipal excitement was furnished by a leading poli-
tician rushing about wildly in search of his
daughter. At length, finding her indulging in a
little fresh air outside the precincts of the hall, he
loudly ordered her to go to the cloak-room and
prepare herself for home, taking occasion also to
make nasty remarks concerning any male who
would take his fair partner out of the gaslight.
Yet at the last local Government House ball, for
which 1000 invites were issued and accepted, the
cramped ballroom was packed with 250 guests,
the spacious gardens and grounds accommodating
the remainder.

years ago, miserable in ad-

are a bit behind the style,
and they have to slink into
town per tram, how they
gnash their store-teeth at
Mrs. Browne reclining among
the cushions of that carriage!
Hell hath no fury like a
lady who has lost her
barouche contemplating the
happy sister who has re-
cently found one, “If I

they seem to say, “I’d let

Old Mr. Meek, of
Broadford (Vic.), has no
superstitious prejudice worth
speaking of. He came home
the other evening and found
his wife dying on the floor.
He placed her oh the bed,
and shortly afterwards re-
tired to rest and—slept be-
side the corpse that night
and the night following. On
the morning after that he
told the police of the decease.
Which recalls to mind a story
told of a well-known Sydney
pressman. He was living in
a coffee-palace, and on going
to his room one night found
a strange man in Ins bed.
Being too tired to raise a
row. and believing the man
to be drunk, he simply lifted
him off the bed and laid him
on the floor. The man did
not awake. He was dead.
“What did you do then?”
the pressman was asked on
one occasion when he told
the story himself. “ I went
to sleep,” lie replied, simply.
“What! with a dead man
in the room ?” cried his audi-
ence, in a tone of horror.
“Why not?” he said, “I
was tired, and I knew he
would be there all right in
the morning.”

Protective Duties.
The worshipful Mayor of Melbourne town —
It makes one consider the lilies
To see him arrayed in his gnrge’us gown—
Has stuck to bis duty by Gillies.
Hi, never omitted, eadi quarter that flitted,
To furnish a guzzle for Gillies.
Thrmgh sneers of a highly offensive kind
Are levelled at mayors by sillies,
Municipal duty is best defined
As giving a luncheon to Gillies.
Not easy lo sicken of charamy and chicken
Are people who blather like Gillies.
When Summer, or Winter, or Autumn came,
Or Spring, with its daffydowndillies,
The head of the city, whatever bis name,
Would further the welfare of Gillies,
Whilst men in the gutter were likely lo in Her—
“ 1 wish I'd the stummiok of Gillies.”
At a smoky fire in the cheerless bush
Old toilers are boiling their billies ;
They haven't a claim on the “ leading ” push,
The same as our excellent Gillies.
No tucker-providers for dirty outsiders
Are bigwigs who cater for Gillies.
That annual dinner was extra good :
loe-pudding to cool down the chillies,
And very particular sorts of food
Passed inti the innards of Gillies.
41 This burgundy fruity is doing your duty,
Most Worshipful Mayor,” said Gillies.
He gratefully spoke of the famous ball,
When an annual bevy of fillies
Discovered their charms in the big Town Hall
To the critical notice of Gillies
Indeed she’s a beauty—you’re doing your duty—
A dear little creature !” quoth Gillies.
'Then Hocli! for the Mayors of Melbourne town
More tough in their hides than Achilles.
The angel-recorder will write it down
“They studied their duty to Gillies.”
We say it with unction, at each civic function
The Mayor did his duty by Gillies.
A REVERIE.
Give me a reed from lyric Arcady
Of softest music, bid the birds to sing
Of all that is divine, the flowers, the sea,
Dim glades of forest for the weary wing,
Murmurs of rivulets—and let me be
One of the choir, that I may pour a song,
Ripe from a heart that is untouched by age,
Rich with the perfumes that to youth belong ;
Of what is never writ in lettered page,
But only whispered with a faltering tongue.
And as I conjure up one fairest face,
No more the birds and forest shall be there,
No more the rivulets shall flow apace ;
I shall forget all other, everywhere
Ever shall see her eyes in sunny place.

Duke of York was twice mairied, as reported, his guilt
will give England an adulterer for a king, and a bastard
for an heir-presumptive.” So you want St. Stead to poke
his nose into this congenial matter, and verify or disprove
the rumours. Dear fellow, Stead is a good dog on such a
scent, but a hundred Steads would never run to earth all
the little incidents of this kind that beautify the British
monarchy “Curlew” (Sydney) i Please call

but no poet. MS. returned “W.”: Lacks indi-
viduality ..“Alt the Stroller”: A by-gone style of
romance “D.A.”: Not new or strong enough. ...
“L. 8.”: Same, but more so “R.R.”; Insufficient
interest “Canioense”; “Death” trite, in spite of
French (?) title; “Suspense” better, but below par;
sketch obviously suggested by Punch’s “ ’eave ‘arf a
brick at Mm.” "Ye Ken Wha”: Broken Hill to

cannia “A.F.”: Sorry unsuitable “J. H. Shaw”:
It seems to us quite possible that the decreased friction
of the sliding wheels may counter-balance for a short
distance the loss of the motive power. The engine-driver
presumably knew what he was talking about; you merely
theorise “ A.J.” : That kind of yarn played out in the
days of Clarissa and Pamela “Rybuck”: Do the
R.C. schools train children to confute R.C. doctrines

that doesn’t stop your verse from being dull both in
thought and style “Albert”: Useless “ X.” :

heaves, or something “Expectoration” (Maoriland):
You ask, “How can political life be pure when a man is
compelled to conceal his honest convictions that he may
not lose the election ?” In other words, “how can politics
be pure when the candidate has to piofess that he is of
the same opinions as the electors before he can get in ?”
Well, the obvious remedy is for the electors always to
return a man who thinks the opposite way. Then, if his
honest convictions are not the opposite way, he will con-
ceal them. “ Caution ” ; Starr-Bowkett building
societies are good enough if honestly managed. They are
common in England : and the principle is sound enough.
It all depends on the honesty, and about that we know
nothing “ Serong” (Emmaville): Don’t get so excited

“ Tirai Piripi ” : Beer-salting story only a variation of the-
yarn about the innkeeper who greased the horses’ teeth.
.... “J. A. 0.” : Wail suggestive of “ Old Dog Tray.” We
loathe old dog Tray. Also young and middle-aged dogs'
Tray ...“Nardoo”: Yarn depends on the theory that

tin. This implies that The Bulletin looks like the War
Cry, and if we thought it did we would go and fall over

or ingenious, or original—it’s only loathsome..." Pasar-
geda”: Will u5e...." 11. R.W.” tG.P.O., Sydney): Almost
good enough, yet doesn’t get there. It just totters on,
the brink of being a decent yarn .. “ W.” (Hurstville):
As you say, the I w should call a spade a spade. Bui first
of all, you must find out that it is a spade, and as the
dreary old maxim doesn’t help you to do that, it is only a
platitude, after all. Generally five of the jury think it is
a spade, and the other seven aren’t dead sure that it is a
hoe ... “ Memphis ” (Newcastle); It is very easy and very
cheap to curse the “professional legislator,” but the
amateur legislator is a lot worse. Almost every very
good, as well as every very bad, politician is a proles-
si mal legislator. Ballance, Higinbotham, Gladstone,;
Parnell, Dsakin, Kingston, Seddon, Parkes, and John,
Davies are all included .. “John S ” (Coolgardie)::
As yours is the first really original poem we have had
from Coolgardie, we send it through the world :
Land of scrub dust and desart sand
Whose arid plains will not yeald food for man
Whose mighty lakes are naught but leads of salt
Where the weried traveler cannot hault
To quench his burning thirst with Adams ale
Or wash his hide from dust most stale
Whose great rich mines are skite and gass
Boomed up by men with lying longues and cheeks of brass
You other siders take heed in time
Come not near this cursct rechet clime
There is nothing here but scrub saultand sand
Western Austrelea is old hell for a free white man.
“ Ab-extra ” (Fiji): Received “ Aurum et Argen-
tum ”: You write in the melancholy strain of a hardened
bigamist, and sound like a collect telegram from Solomon
saying that all things are vanity The Pauper”:
“Damned” is a dull horror about a cheap Chinese hell.
“ Nelson P. W.” : You Degin by explaining that you can
afford to ignore The Bulletin; then you ignore it in 2C
pages of wild remonstrance. Why this awful dis
crepancy ?....“ Ch. Mitchell ” (D.): Vou arc evidently
English because you accuse The Bulletin of being
“Yankee.” The Briton who runs amok with an ink-pot
always reckons he has said sonn thing very desolating
when be has accused bis opponent of being a Yankee.
English don’t like Yankees. Uncle Sain has always
managed to punch J. Bull’s head, on land and sea. ..

was not half so sure about it when afterwards he
went to shake hands with the giant and found
that he was Irish.


DOMESTIC ECONOMY!
WHJLT IS XT ?
DOMESTIC ECONOMY is primarily the art of feeding and clothing the family at as low a rate as possible,
without impairing the family digestion, or taking away the character of its members for being well and com-
fortably dressed. Domestic economy is not comprised in buying a bad article for sixpence when better can be
got for sevenpence ; but if the ruling price for the best is eightpenoe, and somebody comes along and offers it for
eevenpence, then it’s domestic economy to close with the merchant so offering. By all means study this great
and glorious science of social life, because its due and proper observance cannot fail to make poor people rich, and
rich ones richer. What say you ? Will you do your business at

Editor Bulletin, — Your issue of 13th Jan. to
hand. Anent that “dream-like” report of Bayley’s
manager, it strikes me very forcibly that all the most
conspicuous accounts of Coolgardie, as received in the
other provinces, have a tendency to be “ dream like.”
While not disputing the report of amount of gold
already obtained from the mine in question (although
gold, when there is any, and worth about £3 17s.
6d. per oz. at the Mint, can be bought on
these fields for £3 12s. 6d.), it certainly requires
a pinch of salt to swallow this much-interested gentle-
man’s statement that the stone at grass is going to pro-
duce 26,0000 z., or the excavated wash-dirt from the new
tank, 2oz. to the ton. There is no doubt a limited
amount of loose gold lying in the untouched alluvial de-
posit bedded around the cap of the reef, also a limited
quantity of rich stone in the unworked blocks in the
higher levels of the mine, but the sensational dividends of
this “ show ” are evidently over. However, between past
results and future prospects, the interested parties
have succeeded in causing a tall boom, and if many
shares change hands at their present distorted
value, the probable sequel will he the occasional
“dreamlike” report of some suicide’s revolver. For
miles around both Coolgardie proper and the outlying
fields the country'is held under mining-leases, nine-tenths
of which are as free from gold as a frog is from feathers.
Others, again, having yielded a few hundred ounces to the
lucky finders (by hand-brushing) now show a fair pro-
spect evidently left for the inspection of intending specu-
lators. The alluvial industry of the Coolgardie fields is
represented at present by some 500 or so of heart-broken
fossickers crawling over abandoned workings up to their
eyes in dust and sweat and misery, trying to fossick up a
“weight” white waiting for rain and a new rush, for
“things” are going to “hum” here when the rain does
come; and there are 30,000 people from the eastern
colonies (some let us down with 10,000) coming
here next winter, and there is going to be lots
of rain and new gold discoveries to meet all requirements
of the coming multitude. But it is evident to the writer,
and several others, that it is just possible there may be
some hitch in the proceedings. Whatever Coolgardie is
going to be in the coming winter, it is represented just
now by a wretched handful of galvanised iron, calico and
bag shanties, set down in the middle of a drought-bound,
God-abandoned, sore-eyed, howling wilderness of dust,
thirst and desolation, where water is a shilling a gallon, and
nothing obtainable in the shape of food excepting tinned
meat (the mainstay of W. A.) and preserves, at the usual
goldfield prices. Coolgardie is at present, to all appear-
ances, on the eve of a water-famine, owing to the collapse
of the supply from the Govt, bore upon which the con-
densers depended. This is the bore mentioned by that
“ boiled shirt ” correspondent of the Melb. Argus, some
two months back, as yielding splendidly. You can live
on it, too, as he says, but not for long, it being brackish,
and highly mineralised. Anniversary Day, in this golden
city of the west, this combination of the “ Hill,” the
“Towers,” and the Croydon, passed over very quietly,
excepting a bit of foot-racing amongst the unemployed,
during the early part of the day, when it transpired that
a situation was vacant at the top end of the street, Bs. per
day and water. No jobs going begging here, I assure you.
I met yesterday the only fossicker who appeared to be on
good terms with himself. He was an old “ rooster,” who
was dodging around with the usual two dishes, shovel,
and water-bag, and was dry-blowing around burnt rub-
bish-heaps for—solder. There is a bit of tank-making
(plumbers’ work) going on here, and the “ game ” earned
tucker and water, which is more than the gold-seekers
can do now, for of such is the field of Coolgardie, where
the “ live men lie," at the present time.— Wire-Brush.

The fact that Marshall Bros, kept their Hill

small private crushings, and, had they known that the

Silver, 2s. 3Jd. ! Broken Hill output for week
ended Feb. 22 was 268,1450 z. from Proprietary, Block 10,
and Block 14. The present price, if continued, means not
only a heavy fall in profits, but also the stoppage of work
in poor mines and poor portions of good mines.
• # *
By the open-cut system at Broken Hill, says
mine-manager Howell, with 500 men less they produce
nearly 3000 tons of ore a week more. He also remarks
that the silver crisis has closed down over 90 per cent, of
American silver mines ; but the Proprietary could work
as economically, and therefore as long, as any mine in the
world. Roughly speaking, the Proprietary open-cuts
have reduced the cost of raising ore one-half. Further
reductions will ensue as the cuts get down to where large
quantities of good timber will be recovered. If the con-
ditions of ’92 prevailed to-day, says the manager, it would
be impossible to pay divs. with silver at even 2s. sd. an oz.

In the United Coolgardie Gold Mining and

working capital, not cash and promoters’ shares, is asked
for. The co.’s operations began in Sept. last year when
little was known on the field outside Bayley’s. It is next
to Bayley’s with one lease, and near it with two others,
and has big reefs exposed on several of its claims. Having
some dozen leases forming six or seven distinct properties,
on which already a good deal of money has been spent in
opening-up work, it is now proposed to devote
£BOOO to complete several purchases and to the erection
of a crushing-plant to prove what the good-looking big
bodies of stone are made of. Provision is made by re-
served shares for further working-capital if required.
We are told that the successful enlargement of the Syn-
dicate has been placed beyond doubt by reason of the
large number of shares already applied for. Messrs.
Soutar and Hoare, of Post-office Chambers, Pitt-street,
Sydney, are the brokers.

Dear Bulletin, — In issue 20 Jan. you state :
“It is now known that the gold and stone used to salt the
‘Last Call’ came from the Etheridge, where it was
buried years before. It was taken to the Last Call and
artistically put into different parts of the mine to deceive
Hammond and others.” Now, this theory is quite
erroneous. The gold that the mine was salted with was
actually got in the same shaft that was afterwards so
successfully salted ; it was taken out of a small but rich
leader (ironstone). This I know for a fact as I paid a visit
to the mine long before it was rigged for the market, and
was afterwards one of the first three who worked that
shaft for the co. As to the mine being salted with
Etheridge gold and stone that’s all bosh. As a matter of
fact there was no stone in the mine; it was a sort of
kaolin deposit resembling alluvial that had been screened
of all stone. The crusher was never used—the ore just
simply passed through the feeder into the Huntingdon
mills. Stone would have been a “put-away;” the gold
was supposed to be loose in the kaolin, and the kaolin
Basin, o.i the side of the hill, was supposed to be a thermal
spring, carrying gold to unlimited depths.—Yours, etc.,

REPORT BY Mr. THOMAS BIBBY
TO THE
Shareholders of the United Coolgardie Gold
Mining and Prospecting Co.
Gentlemen,
I beg to submit for your consideration the
following report on your mining properties at
Coolgardie, Western Australia. My views on the
field generally have been published in Perth, Ade-
laide, Melbourne, and Sydney, and I have no
doubt have been read by you. I need only say
that these have been expressed with the greatest
deliberation, and I am satisfied that they will be
borne out by results. I shall therefore confine
myself to the different properties in which you
are interested.
Blocks 130 and 13 (“Ritanita.”)
The day after my arrival at Coolgardie, 2nd of
January, I made my first examination of this
lease. It is situated about a quarter of a mile
south-west of Bayley’s Reward mine, and has an
area of 12 acres. I found on the lease three dis-
tinct reefs exposed by surface trenches only. These
reefs run north-north-east by south-south-west.
Two of them are small, running from 1 foot to 2
feet 6 inches. Both show free gold in payable
quantities, but I am unable to say much about
them because of the small extent they are opened
up. Their positions are shown in the accompany-
ing plan. About 60 feet to the west of one of
these small reefs I found a large reef had been cut
through by a trench, which practically only un-
covered the reef. In all the stone dislodged I
found coarse and fine gold, and I at once deter-
mined to confine my operations to this body. I
put three men on to w r ork, and in the course of
four days I had the reef uncovered for a distance
of 40 feet, by removing the loam and cutting a
trench right along the cap of the reef. I also sunk
a shaft to a depth of 12 feet at the southern end of
the trench (as shown on plan). By this work I
proved the reef to be between 6 and 7 feet in
thickness, consisting of a solid body of quartz and
ironstone enclosed between slate walls, which, like
the reef itself, are well defined. In breaking stone
in the shaft, as well as in every part of the
trench, free, rough and fine gold could easily
be seen. From the shaft, which is carried
lengthways across the reef, I raised fully seven
tons of stone, which I am perfectly satisfied will
yield 100 ounces of gold when crushed. I have not
a doubt on this point, as, in addition to the free
gold showing in every part of the reef, the splen-
did prospects I got by dollying stone in which
gold was not visible led me to this conclusion. I
deemed it advisable to have the trench filled in,
and I at once determined to see if I could make
satisfactory arrangements for acquiring for the
company Block 13, which adjoins it on the
southern boundary. As you will see, the Block
has been pegged out at right angles to this reef,
which was not known when it was taken up. This
I have succeeded in doing. I would also point out
that there are a number of dry-blowers on each of
these leases, busily engaged in turning over the
surface, and while I was there nuggets, one weigh-
ing 24 ounces, one ounces (a quartz specimen
nearly all gold), and a third ounces, were found
on these leases, from which altogether some hun-
dreds of ounces of surface gold has been got. I
may say that these dry-blowers have the right of
working the surface until the leases are issued by
the Government. Should this large body of stone
continue to go down carrying the gold it shows on
the surface and in the bottom of the shaft, and I
can see no reason why it should not, this property
is one of very great value. I can congratulate the
shareholders on the possession of one-half of this
lease (Ritanita), the transfer of which has been
duly made.
Blocks 206 and 36 ( (< Tas D’or”).
These leases have an area of 12 acres each.
There are three lines of reef on Block 206 exposed
by trenches sunk in different places a distance of
over 200 feet along the surface. They are from
1 to 3 feet in thickness and run north and south.
Free gold in payable quantities can be seen in the
stone, which will return from 3 to 5 ounces to
the ton ; but little work has been done on this
block. On Block 36, which adjoins on the western
boundary, there is a reef 6 feet wide, showing
gold freely. This reef also runs north and south,
and underlays to the east, whereas the three
smaller reefs referred to in Block 206 underlay to
the west, and I am inclined to think that they will
prove to be leaders from the large reef; and it
will be found by sinking that they will come
together. A considerable distance, some 300 ft.
west on Block 36, there is another reef 18 inches
thick, running north and south and underlaying to
the east; on this a shaft has been sunk to a
distance of 40ft. The manager of Bayley’s
Reward claim was good enough to put through a
small sample from this reef weighing 2cwt. 151 b.
and yielding 2oz. sdwt. retorted gold ; certificate
of which I attach. Together 1 consider these
blocks will form a valuable property. Their situa-
tion is about a mile and a half south-west of
Bayley’s Reward mine. They occ.upy a small
rise, which forms at each end of the leases a small
gully. These gullies have been partially turned
over by dry blowers, and their workings towards
the reefs show that the gold found lias been shed
from them. These gullies come together about a
quarter of a mile below the leases, where a large
dam could easily be made to retain water during
the wet season. When I left Sydney, Block 206
was under offer to the Company for a large sum
of money, and a deposit of =B2OO had been paid. I
declined to recommend its purchase on the terms
offered. It was eventually agreed that the Com-
pany should purchase Block 36, amalgamate it
with Block 206, and that the deposit money should
be placed to the credit of the Company to the
wages account. This has been confirmed by the
payment of a deposit of .£lOO, and the transfer of
Block 206 has been duly made. I strongly recom-
mend the completion of the purchase of Block 36,
in which case the Company will be the owners of
one-half of the two leases.
Blocks 5 and 262.
Block 5 is a lease of five acres on the line of
Bayley’s Reward reef, and is situated about 300
yards from Bayley’s northern boundary, one lease
only intervening. On the lease there are several
lines of reef (as shown by the accompanying plan),
but so far only two have been opened up, On one
reef, running north and south, I sank a hole about
Bft deep, proving the reef to be 4ft in thickness.
L saw gold in breaking the stone, but it is not
rich ;it might go an ounce to the ton. The other
reef runs as shown in the plan. There is not a
doubt in my mind but this will prove to be
Bayley’s reef. I traced this reef along the surface
through the adjoining Block and up to Bay-
loy’s northern shaft. I got gold along the
surface, bub I did nob think it expedient to do
much prospecting on it, on account of the
Company’s position with regard to adjoining
Block. Block 262 adjoins Block 5 on the
western boundary, and is the additional area
secured to the company in terms of the agreement,
making fche property altogether 11 acres. Time
would nob permit me to prospect the reefs showing
on the surface of 262. I need hardly point out
the value of this property, from its position alone,
more particularly in the event of the Company
being successful in acquiring the intervening
Block. It would give the Company a large addi-
tional area, and join Bayley’s boundary on the
line of reef.
Bloch 6.
This is a lease of 10 acres adjoining the western
boundary of Bayley’s Reward claim as shown on
the plan The western-or what is known on the
field as Gorrie’s-reef runs through the corner of
this Block, and underlays into it. The reef has
nob been found on the surface, but the workings
in Bayley’s South show the reef to be going into
this property; and this is admitted by Mr. Gorrie
himself. A very large amount of dry-biowing has
been done on this lease, bub so far as I could see
no reefs had been exposed. This may be accounted
for by the fact that fche surface or loam is com-
paratively very deep, running from 10 feet to 20
feet in depth. The alluvial workings clearly in-
dioate the large amount of alluvial gold recovered.
This Block is under offer to the Company, a small
deposit having been paid ; bub subject to confir-
mation I, on behalf of the Company, made an
arrangement which, I believe, is of a more satis-
faotnrv character
factory cnaracter.
Blochs 16 and 10 ( (( Star Of Cool-
gar die.”)
mu 1 . e • ~
These leases have an area of six acres each and
are situated three miles south-west of Bayley s
Several shafts have been sunk up to 40 feet m
depth each sunk on the same reel, which runs
from 5 to 7 feet in thickness carrying good gold all
the way down Coarse gold shows so freely and
is so well distributed through the stone that I
estimate it to be at least three ounces to the ton
Large quantities of stone are lying at grass, and
in the adjoining Block 17 the same reef is 9 feet
wide, and I saw some wonderful specimens taken
from the reef, I took a particular fancy to these
Blocks, and before leaving I urged Mr. Nyhan,
who has been left in ehare-e of the Cotnnanv’s
nronerties and who is a shareholder in Block 19
properties, and wno is a snarenoider in Diock u,
to lose no time in endeavouring to secure them to
this Company. He wires me that he has sue-
needed. I strongly recommend their being taken
on the advantageous terms offered, as outside of
Ri StM theBB B ' OCkS am ° ngSt the beSt
on the whole field.
Massie’s Lease.
This property consists of a 12-acre lease. It is
situated about eight miles south from the Cool-
gardie township. It adjoins Burbank’s Birthday
Gift on the northern boundary. No work has
been done on the lease, except that done by my-
self in prospecting the reef near Burbank’s boun-
dary. The reef is shown on the surface, being
covered in places by 2 or 3 feet of loam. It runs
north-east and south-west, and consists of a solid
body of quartz 8 feet wide. I broke stone in dif-
fer.-nt places along the reef, and had no difficulty
iu finding coarse gold. I believe the stone will go
from 3 to soz. to the ten. In Burbank’s tho reef
has been exposed by shallow shafts for fully ten
chains, averaging from 7 to 8 feet wide and show-
ing splendid gold. This property (Massie’s) I got
under offer for three months, subject to your con-
firmation. I thought so much of the property
that, ontny own responsibility, I took up another
12 acres on the western boundary so as to secure
the underlay of the reef, and I strongly advise the
Company to take Massie’s lease on the terms
offered, for, with the Block taken up on your
behalf, it is a valuable property.
General Remarks.
When I found that the Company had such a
splendid property in Ritanita I decided to bring
some two tons of the stone to Sydney apart from
any consideration of cost; but suddenly I was
made aware of a dispute of titles that had cropped
up with reference to Blocks 5 and 6, and, after
consultation with the owners and the Registrar, I
was advised, and myself deemed it necessary, to
return as soon as possible to Perth for the purpose
of interviewing the Secretary for Mines. It is not
necessary to enter into details here, but it may
be encouraging to learn that I was assured that
the titles were alright; and that it was only a
matter of time when they would be gazetted. In
consequence of my unexpected quick return I was
compelled to abandon the idea of bringing the
stone with me to Sydney ; but this can be done
at any time if so desired. I regret also to state
that the large samples of specimens which I
myself broke from the Company’s properties, as
well as from the properties under offer, have not
yet come to hand. They would not take them
under any consideration in the coach, so I was
compelled to send them by team. I have already
arranged by wire for other samples, and have
replies saying they are on the road. I hope both
lots will turn up, although our experience has
been that it is not an unusual thing for samples
to be stolen en route from Coolgardie. The few I
have are those I carried in ray handbag. In con-
clusion, I can congratulate you on the value of
the properties already acquired. Since my boy-
hood I have been engaged in mining, and it has
fallen to my lot to examine many mining fields,
but never in the whole course of my life have I
examined a field which presents such innumerable
evidences of great and permanent value as I saw
at Coolgardie.
I willingly take upon myself the responsibility
of urging you to so enlarge this Company as to
enable it to take over the leases recommended,
and to deal with your properties in a manner com-
mensurate with their value. If you do that I
have not the slightest hesitation in saying that
your Company will grow into an organisation
worthy of New South Wales mining enterprise,
and will redound to the credit of everybody con-
nected with it.
I am, gentlemen,
Your obedient Servant,
THOS. BIBBY

POSTCRIPT. —I have to day received information
that the samples referred to have been recovered
and are now on their way to Sydney, and a tele-

I anticipated, that the disputes in referrnce to
Blocks 5 and 6 have been decided by the Minister

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mrs, M. A. GUMMING,

“ About a year ago, I had a severe attack
of Influenza, which left me very weak, with-
out energy, appetite, or interest in life.
Obtaining little or no relief from doctors, or
from the many remedies recommended to
me, I Anally tried Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and,

from that time, I began to gain health and
strength. I continued the treatment until
fully recovered, and now have very great

Attention is drawn to the fact that during the
last campaign of the furnace combined charges of
copper and silver ores resulted most successfully,
and large quantities of each are known to exist in
the syndicate’s properties and in the immediate
neighbourhood.
The inability of the Directors to call up further
capital to more fully develops the mines since the
late financial disasters is the sole reason for this
step being taken.

RAZOR
There will be no blood spilt in “ revolu-
tionising ” the House of Lords —but a lot of fat.
“ An alliance between France and Russia
is not unnatural, for the spirit of revolution is in
both.”— Heine. (About 1830).
Hordern Bros., of Sydney, recently hired
an aboriginal blackfellow to stand in their win-
dow as an advt. “Look here,” said the darkey
to John L. Hordern, “ this is disgraceful. You
gib me one poun’ three days an’ you make
thousan’s out o’ me.”
On the Mount Lofty to Wallialla cutting
(Vic.), there was, for several years, and probably
still is, an idiot, who, under the impression that
he was employed by the Walhalla Conned to do
so, passed his time in sweeping the cutting clear
of ad leaves and debris for a distance of about two
miles.
Archibald Alison, in Blackwood’s Maga-
zine, calculates the chances of a European war in
the near future, and sums up ominously. He thinks
Russia and France will be on one side, and Ger-
many, Austria, and Italy on the other. The first
combination can bring into the field 5,437,971
men, 1,480,000 horses, and 9920 guns ; the second,
5,941,276 men, 813,996 horses, and 8184 guns. The
chances are about equal.
When the Thursday Island cable broke
last Nov. the French cable co., then finished with
the Noumea line, offered to restore it permanently
for £ 1500. This was too large a sum for the
economical Government, which started tin-
kering it up with spare bits of old cable, and
without the necessary appliances. Up to date it
has cost more than the amount mentioned, and
ere this is printed will probably have parted
again, as it is by all accounts now almost unwork-
able owing to defects in reconstruction.
The Indian Civil Service is the most
economical on earth. You cannot get a lead-
pencil beyond the allowance, and an application
for a fresh piece of indiarubber has always to be
accompanied by the remains of the old piece, that
the stationery department may be sure there is
no waste. A lady-ward at a military academy
recently wanted an artificial tooth. There was no
precedent, and the Government of India appointed
a standing committee to report on the matter.
The report being satisfactory, the tooth was duly
sanctioned and fitted, three months after date of
application.
The proprietor of a country business show-
ing highly prosperous returns, a couple of years
ago, wrote one day recently to a Sydney creditor,
offering to put his business into the hands of a
trustee or of an agent for sale, and himself to go
into the service of his creditor at ,£1 per week,
leaving the balance of wages in the creditor’s
hands as instalments of the debt. This latter
proposal recalls the early British days of debtor-
slavery. In the rural districts of Southern France
there is still in operation a custom under which
the creditor seizes the debtor of an unpaid account
and makes him work it off in his vineyard or
farm.
Queensland railway items : —A man up-
country sent to Brisbane for two water-bags.
These were received, enclosed in a box with a
quantity of stones. Enquiry by the puzzled
receiver showed that the rail-charge on the small
parcel would have been 9s. 6d., but sent with
the stones it was only 4s. 6d. A Brisbane
merchant sent two empty jars to a station on the
Southern line, for which he was charged 4s. 6d.,
but they were returned to him full for 2s. 6d.
1200 doz. bananas were sent from the Baderim
mountain district—6o miles from Brisbane. The
freight cost 325. 6d., and the nett return to the
grower was a 2d. stamp ! Another lot resulted in
a loss of 2s. 6d.
Judicial oaths are unknown in Japan.
Apropos the refusal of a Japanese tribunal to
allow an Englishman to be sworn, thus the Kobe
Chkoniclk ; —“ The use of the judicial oath sets
up two standards of truth, that which is sworn
and that which is unsworn. To regard the second
as unreliable is to render it unreliable, and to
foster, as far as judicial requirement may, a nation
of liars. The remedy is as simple as effective.
Let every tub stand upon its own bottom. Leave
perjury (oath-breaking) which is a sin against
God, to be punished by God, and punish lying
(deception) which is, in the first place, a sin against
man, as now we punish perjury.”
At North Melbourne Court, the other day,
two men were convicted of insulting behaviour
and even woise language than usual. Then Dr.
Lloyd, the Cobbloquent local magistrate, “went
for ” them. His reproof was awful in its severity,
and he finished up by telling the staggered
prisoners that their proceedings would have dis-
graced the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah,
after which he fined them 40s. and 20s. respectively.
That was all. When Heaven squared accounts
with Sodom and Gomorrah it struck them both
by lightning as the only solution of the difficulty,
but Magistrate Lloyd fined Sodom 40s. and let
Gomorrah off with Ml, and evidently felt that he
had done his duty in full.
Nervous sufferers will bud it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page

Whether smoking is an evil or a comfort,
or both together, is a question often discussed.
Ladies, who don’t smoke themselves, generally
opine that it is a nasty habit: it is bad for the
curtains and the lungs; it may put fire to your
bed ;it makes one feel thirsty ; and so on. Men,
on the other side, believe in their pipe, or their
Frossard’s Swiss; and the multifarious dangers
which they know they brave act on their persever-
ing nature like so many stimulants. Queen Vic-
toria and Mr. Gladstone are both decidedly of
opinion that smoking is a comfort, indeed ; for the
duty on tobacco brought in over =£10,000,000 to
the English Government last year.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You think that what has happened is too blissful
to be true,
You feel cleverer and bigger and more handsome
than you were ;
You think no man has ever been so lucky as are
you.
When you’re right, old man—with her.
You are thinking of your sweetheart, you are
thinking of her yet,
The answer that she gave you does to memory
recur ;
And the kiss that followed on it which you never
will forget,
When you’re right, old man—with her.
How gracious of her was it when she let you hold
her hand
(What delirium of happiness a girl can thus
confer!)
And the dewy glisten in her eyelids made you
understand
You were right, old man —with her.
Then you told her (how remarkably your manly
voice was hushed)
How you thought of her at daytime, and you
dreamt of her at night,
And you knew, though she said nothing, but just
looked down and blushed,
You were r!(flit, old man - all right !
When at last she looked up at you with the love
light in her eye,
While your arm her waist encircled and you
held her mighty Light,
And her bosom heaved beneath it and she looked
up with a sigh.
You were right, old man —all right !
You don't know how you got home, but you felt
as if you flew,
And the world seemed extra cheerful, and the
sun shone extra bright,
And everyone looked joyful, and you wondered if
they knew
You were right, old man —all right!
Then you wondered what she saw in you to care
for you so well.
And you wondered how such blissfulness could
possibly occur,
And you had a wild and eager craving every one
to tell
You were right—all right—with her !
And you walked about till daylight, for you
couldn’t go to bed—
It really did not matter, for no matter where
you were
The one thought was everlastingly a-ringing in
your head—
You were right—all right - with her!
And you couldn’t sleep for thinking, and you cared
not what you ate,
You were off your feed at daytime, and you lost
your rest at night;
But you had a joy within you for all this to com-
pensate—
You were right with her —all right!
No doubt you’ve had some pleasure and some
happy times since then ;
No doubt there have been incidents that set your
heart a-stir,
But you know as well as can be that your gayest
time was when
You were right, you knew, with her.
So you’ll sympathise with Lawson, and mayhap
you feel inclined
To tell him such a triumph’s worth the chances
of a fight;
You’re repaid for all your hazard of a cracked
heart when you find
You are right with her— all right!

Dear Bulletin, —You seem fond of
propounding problems- here is one. Not so very
many years ago an Australian could be recognised
anywhere, from his habit of taking off his liquor
standing—in one act, so to say. Most of us of
middle-age can remember the fashion of the old
hand who gulped down his 30. o.p. rum neat, and
then breathlessly and gaspingly held out his hand
for the water-bag. Now-a-days, however, men
are more inclined to sit down and discuss their
drink slowly. Witness the improvement in the
arrangement of our best bars. Does this arise
from the depression ; because they want one drink
to go thrice as far, or is it. fin de sidle civilisation ?
Anyhow, it is the case.—D. *

WILLIAM JOHN LYN®.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
ihe V.R.O. puts itself in a ridiculous position
by allowing horse-owners to bring the club’s handicapper
up for trial before his employers. “J. B. Clark” charges
Dakin with inefficiency or dishonesty in the management
of an important branch of the V.R.O. business, and the
racing firm calls upon its trusted servant to prove that
they haven’t mistaken his character all these years,
instead of telling the other man to file his protest and
leave it to be proved or disproved by events to come. Mr.
Dakin ought not properly to have received any official
notification that his handicapping had been called into
question, nor would he if the complainant were an obscure
owner. The whole business is a painful evidence of weak-
ness in the government. A handicapper must be put on
the same pedestal as the judge, unless they want an
eternal row in the racing camp. To admit any doubt of
Dakin’s fairness in dealing with a particular trio of
second-rate animals is to invite complaints from evsry
owner who doesn’t consider his horse “wellin’* every
handicap he is weighted for. Did J. B. Clark or the
V.R.C. contemplate the idea of the handicapper’s dis-
missal because he possibly put a couple of pounds more
than he might have put on the back of Warpaint ? Or
was it considered likely that Mr. Dakin would need a
warning, like a jockey, to be more careful with Warpaint
for the future ?

The Autumn Meeting at Flemington commences
next Saturday, and the old alluring “ double," Newmarket
Handicap and Australian Cup, is open to be picked by
anyone who can see it. The long race should not puzzle
backers very much by the time the horses are at the post,
for if Carnage comes to the scratch with Mr. Wilson’s
money on his back— i.e., if Carnage starts a warm first
favourite—he ought to win. It may be assumed that the
horse will not run unless thoroughly fit. When fit he is
good enough to swear by. A horse out of the common is
not slopped by a few pounds the worst of the weights
with this horse or that other horse ; if he were he
wouldn’t be out of the common at all. Carnage has to
give 13Ibs. to The Sailor Prince and Light Artillery, and to
receive only 13Ibs. from Portsea. These seem the most
likely ones to beat Mr. Wilson’s colt, especially on paper,
but the chances are that the Derby winner will be equal
to his handicap, if started. Whatever the Wilson stable
may start for any race will be worthy of consideration
this meeting.
As for the Newmarket flutter, it is about as open
as usual, if not more so. Of the top-weights, Portunatus,
Ascot Vale, or Lord Hopetoun is fast enough to win with
the best of luck in his favour, and all three are said to be
looking well. One of them, at least, is very likely to beat
Parramatta and Cannon. This is the season for mares,
and speedy ones like The Dauphine and Gaillardia may
“shake” minor handicaps if they get defeated in the
Newmarket. The animal that seems to present most of
the appearance of a “dead bird” is Capstan, on latest
and reliable “form.” Treating the event as a missing-
word competition, in which guessers pay on an average
about ss. for every shillingsworth of guess, one might as
well pick Capstan to fill the vacant space.

The longstanding monopoly enjoyed in Mel-
bourne rowing circles by the Yarra YarraClub appears to
be at length broken up. The defeat of the club's cham-
pion four at three regattas in succession by the hitherto
unknown Mercantiles, seems to point to the supremacy of
the latter over a mile course. The old 3, Yeomans, who
rowed 7in last Victorian interprovincial crew, is, it is
only fair to state, no longer in the Yarra’s boat, having
left thesmellful river for Maoriland.

Old Carbine grows very fastidious in his fancies.
He will only let one particular lad mount him, and,
though he graciously accepts all courtesies in the shape of
carrots, &c., if any but the favoured boy gets into the
saddle, the old horse dissents, and keeps on dissenting
until the objectionable person retires. Sometimes on the
track he seems to fancy himself at Flemington again on
Cup-day, and, taking the bit in his teeth, gallops (or two
or three miles. It is not thought likely by his trainer that
he will ever perform again. That troublesome leg forbids.

Memraott’s impudence in accepting 3000 points
in 15,000 from Peall, at “spot-stroke allowed” billiards,
deserved the awful thrashing he received. Memmott
scored 4000 or so whilst Peall was knocking off the
15,000, and even then the Australian could have had
none the worst of the luck.

In a Melb. suburb monumental mason’s yard
lies a gravestone thus inscribed :
Beneath this stone Sam B lies,
No one laughs and no one cries ;
Where he’s gone and how he fares
No one knows and no one cares.
The stone has been in the yard ever since a certain Melb.
Cup of about 20 years ago, as the owner has yet had
no occasion lo use it. He was lucky enough to secure
second horse in a big sweep, and after drawing his cheque
invested a portion of the money in the necessary allot-
ment and marble. He has, it is said, since seen the time
when he would have liked to realise on his property.

At the Boxing Day race-meeting at Bogo
Creek, Queensland, a small 2/6 tote was run (blackboard
style) by “ Hardfaoed Mick.” The last race of the day,
won by a rank outsider, had a total of 87 (two on the
winner). One of the lucky twain came up smiling for his
dividend, and was calmly handed 7/6 by H.M. Scanning
the board, the recipient commenced to growl. “ Why,
hang it all, I should get a bit more than this ; there’s only
two of us on it.” “ Why, blime me, ain’t yer satisfied?
How’d yer like to be the other bloke?” “Why?” “’Co*

London Refkrbe publishes an awful warning to
Turf "mugs,” in the form of two tables showing the fruits
of investment in high-priced yearlings. The moral effect
of the principal table, which deals with the yearlings of
1891, is damaged by the singular fact that the costliest of
them all returned a splendid profit in stakes. For La
Fleohe the shrewd and lucky Baron Hirsch paid £5500 in
her infancy, and the mare had won £31,153 by the end of
last season. This is a record in the annals of blood-stock
speculation. With La Fleche out of the way it would
seem the act of a maniac to bid high for the finest-looking
yearling on earth. Out of 58 that were sold in 1891 at
prices ranging from £lOOO to £4OOO, seven animals wouldn’t
stand training at all, whilst 21 of them have never yet
won a race. Thirteen fall short of £lOOO apiece in stakes
(most of the 13 haven’t won £300) and only ten attained
to the distinction of four figures on both sides of the
ledger. The others have been exported and their fates
are shrouded in mystery. Lord Dudley takes the bun for
fooling away his money at this kind of gambling. He
paid £15,750 for eight youngsters ; twm of them never ran,
four others yielded nil, whilst the other two won £963
and £175 respectively 1 Mr. Dan Cooper bought a couple
for £3150 without getting a red cent of his money back,
but a similar investment by W. Cooper turned out fairly
well. One solitary thousand pounder fell to the Heir
Apparent’s bid, and it appreciated this mark of royal
favour by promptly breaking down in most of its legs.
THREE FORTUNATE WOMEN.
Wk will introduce you to the oldest one first. Her
name is Mrs. Jessie Russell, and she lives near the
city of New York, in America. She was born in
London in 1787, and is therefore 105 years old.
She remembers many incidents of her childhood,
and still has traces of former beauty. Her eyes
are bright, and become animated when she talks.
She retains her mental faculties completely. She
descends two flights of stairs to every meal, and
returns without assistance. Up to three years
ago she was a regular attendant at the Greenwood
Baptist Church, Her sight is excellent, and she
reads the newspapers every day, and takes great
interest in the news from England. She has
never had any serious illness in her life, and her
appetite and digestion are almost as good as they
were fifty years ago.
The second woman says: “Ever since I was a
child I have suffered from illness. Thirteen years
ago a tired, languid, and heavy feeling came over
me. The white-of my eyes became tinged with
yellow, my skin was sallow, and my hands and
feet were cold and clammy. My mouth tasted
badly, especially in the morning, and I was often
sick, vomiting a sour, frothy fluid. I had a pain
in the chest and sides, heartburn, and flatulency.
For four years I suffered like this, and I shall be
glad to recommend the medicine that finally cured
me.” (Signed) (Mrs.) Francks Emily Smith, 49a,
Woodhouse Street, Leeds, January 25th, 1892,
The third woman says: “ I have been delicate
all my life. For the past six years I have always
felt tired, languid, and weak. I had a poor
appetite, a bad taste in the mouth, and pain after
every morsel I ate. I was dizzy, and often felt as
if I was going to fall. I always felt sick, and
would retch and strain, but could bring nothing
up. There was a dull pain at my right side and
a dreadful pain between the shoulders. I never
knew what it was to be well. After being on my
feet for a while my legs would swell very much;
No doctor was able to help me, nor any medicine .
that is, up to the time I took the one which gave
me my health back. I never felt so well in my life
as Ido now.” (Signed) (Mrs.) Sarah Sharman,
Glinton, near Market Deeping, February 19th,
1892.
Why do we put these three women in a group—
the one venerable woman in America and the
two others here in England ? They are perfect
strangers to one another and always will be. We
do it to show how long and happily a woman may
live if she only happens to escape the malady
that everywhere threatens her sex; and also to
show that those who have been burdened and
cursed with it may be cured and once more taste
the joys of health.
Mrs. Smith concludes her letter in these words :
“After taking three bottles of Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup all pain and sickness left me, and
I knew no more of the ailment that had troubled
me so long, indigestion and dyspepsia. I know
others who have been benefited by the Syrup. All
sufferers should use it.
Mrs. Sharman adds that after she had doctored
and doctored and taken everything, almost with-
out getting any good from it, Mr. Webster, a
grocer of Glinton, said, “Why don’t you use
Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup? ” She acted on
his suggestion, and health wasn’t long in coming.
“I cannot speak too highly of Seigel’s Syrup,”
she says. We should agree with her in that
opinion, for a remedy that will in a few weeks put
an end to a case of chronic indigestion and dys-
pepsia is certainly worth a good word or two.
Now here you have these three Englishwomen
—one so fortunate as to have lived more than a
century without an illness ; the others (still more
fortunate) have known the sadness of suffering
and the pleasure of recovery.
Oh, my ! oh, my ! how hard it is to tell who is
best off in this queer world.

Sizing Them Up.
Editor Bulletin,—
This song to the Democracy I chant:
Is it not time you ceased bowing to monograms
and rings,
To canes and gloves and all assertiveness ?
And ceased, to do business with institutions that
patronise and scorn you —
'The time, cramming their cupboards from your
scanty barns? .
How long ere you teach children to distinguish
education from goodness,
And affable manners from goodness ?
And before you teach them that courage often
serves selfishness ?
And how education is the indispensable instrument
of swindling ?
You seem unable to detect the untrustworthy
gentleman.
I will tell you his fashion :
He is at, ease among men ;
Courageous, affable, obliging, kind, of pleasant
appearance.
These things because they are pleasant to him,
They are powerful aids to his ends also.
You will detect him by his delight of ample com-
fort,
By his paying his labourer but a-tenth of the sum
he charges for a like amount of work.
Plainly, he is announced by his respect of costly
clothes,
By his determination to Get on in the World,
By his concealed fast-clinging to saluted positions,
By his prudent reticence at public meetings,
By his flaunting of the Labour candidate.
Democracy, teach your children to loathe these
men and women.
Come, conclude discussion.
By justice you can starve the lawyer.
By your post-office much of the profit of exchange
can be placed in your public pocket.
Vote your brother of Labour into your Parliament,
Pay your workman all he earns;
Cease to repeat a belief of these things, and act.
The hours’ are begetting months, and they are dig-
ging your graves. Do something, then,
quickly. r
ago a Democrat sang the song 1 echo. You
caught the tune, and your enemies supplied
false verse.
Now I give you the true words.
B.i friendly, just, and bold, and these without fear
of poverty.
Poverty !. Is this your fear ?
Then there is no hearty-helping Democracy.
She is unborn.
Cowards ! Cowards all !
J. GALLOWAY.

Abgus. This whilst the air is still noxious with
the stench of the last boom. More Abgus :
If we reduce charges on land in the matters of taxes
and freights, we by so much increase the returns from
land, and the better position we put the producer in in
this way, the better is the security which he can offer and
the brighter are his prospects of obtaining cheap money.
How artfully the Abgus confounds the producer
with the landlord and the land-shark, and
beseeches the people to pawn themselves irretriev-
ably in order to secure cheap money for the other
fellow, who will presently be raving for cheap
people also.
Our recent visitor, the attractive Miss
Flora Shaw, of the Times, is a niece of Eyre
Massey Shaw, late chief of London Fire Brigade,
and consequently connected with Lord Olarina
(never heard of him before, but we have been
reading the English press for 20 years, and have
encountered the name of at least two new lords
every time we looked at a paper). _Her lecture,
recently given at the Royal Colonial Institute,
London, was, whatever one may think of the sub-
ject matter thereof, most admirably read, and in
this respect so marked a contrast to many deliver-
ances in the same place, that Q. Agent-General
Garrick well might say (writes a Bulletin corres-
pondent), “ that if many more ladies like Miss
Shaw appeared on the scene, the men would have
to hide their diminished heads.”
Thus a correspondent:—
Editor Bulletin,— A deputation of unemployed lately
waited on J. B. Patterson to see if there was any glint of
work for the coming winter. They were long, gaunt, ill-
fed and ill-dressed men, most of them, with dark circles
round their eyes and knotty hands. Patterson, with that
blunt, bull-necked boorish ness which he calls “ backbone,”
and which may be seen any day in the demeanour of the
common or garden hog, cut short the speech of the
“ member,” who acted as M.C., with the remark that
they were “ wasting his time ” (an Australian Premier,
apparently, always regards the plaint of a hungry “ un-
employed ’’ as a personal insult and as no earthly business
of his in any case), and told them they could go and
cut mallee scrub in Gippsland for ss. an acre. It was
pointed out to the retired butcher that this wage would
not afford the men (most of them married) more than the
means of the barest sustenance for themselves and none
at all for their wives and families. J.B.P. c!icked-to that
lovely lower maxillary of his and thought that “ their
friends or the benevolent institutions (all crammed full
and head-over-heels in debt) could look after them.” This
remark was so genially suggestive of a latent faith in the
cemetery being the most probable deliverance from such
domestic burdens that the deputation froze for a
time and twirled its hat reflectively. A timid
reference was hazarded to the winter time, now
approaching, being scarcely suitable for out-door
work in the mallee ; but the Jawbone crunched it up with
brutal directness: “It’s time that all that bosh was
exploded. 1 am convinced that the winter time is the
pleasantest for work in this part of the world.” And with
this observation, so illustrative of a sympathetic and
thoughtful consideration for the constitution of the work-
ing-man, ringing in its ears, the deputation withdrew in
quite a glow of contentment and peace. It is one of
Patterson’s firm convictions that the unemployed are as
reasonably happy as Jerome's peasants, and that the
utter absence of work for a few thousands of them is the
last thing that can have aught to do with their being
hungry and discontented. While J.B.P. is in office, and
draws £2OOO per annum, and has three meals per diem,
he utterly refuses to entertain the idea that there is any
distress amongst the labouring classes, or that it is in any
way his business to alleviate it. When th ■ fact is callously
thrust upon him, as in this instance, he deals with it in
his own pigheaded fashion, shirks any direct responsi-
bility, and promiscuously distributes a few hundred men
out into the wastes. And this is what Premier Patterson
calls “providing ” for the unemployed.
Charged with a breach of the Lord’s Day
Act, Manager Andrew Anderson, of Yarram
Batter Factory, Vic.— a married man of between
30 and 40 years—was dismissed because the prose-
cution bad not proved that he was over 14 !
When the Kearsage (she sank only the
other day) and Alabama fought, Lancaster,
owner of the Deerhound, was urged by his
wife not to go out of Cherbourg harbour, and
see the battle, because it was Sunday. When she
saw it, she kept on saying, “Closer, closer I”
Which is always the way with a woman when it
comes to an engagement.
The Bulletin is glad to learn that its last
Christmas number wasn’t • the only Christmas
number in the w'orld which was full of ghosts and
bones and groans and sudden death and vveed-
covered tombs, and the like. The following is
the Pall Mall (Christmas) Budget, as reviewed
by London Referee :
The first picture I found when I opened the Budget
was “ One of the Devils of Notre Dame.” He was an n ly
and coarse-looking devil, leaning on his sharp elbows, i.is
hideous head resting between his sharp-pointed claws,
and his tongue protruding mockingly. I am not sure that
the first thing you want to see on the Saviour’s Birthday
is a full-page drawing of the Devil, but tastes differ. The
next item in the Christmas Budget was “The Bhvme of
the Three Sealers,” by Rudyard Kipling. A strong,
vigorous piece of work this, but not much peace and
goodwill about. It’s all Hell and the Devil, and blood
and the death-rattle, and red pools and the dead that
rocked drunkenwise, and some bloodthirsty ruffians of the
sea who do each other to death in a fog with much strong
language and local colour. I turned the pages to the end,
and when the end came I folded this beautiful Christmas
number up and bound it with orape and put it away for
perusal at a more fitting season. 1 think 1 shall take it
with me the first time 1 am invited to a funeral and have
to make a long journey in a mourning coach. The
number, principally written in the Cockney language
and blood, is a curious combination of the Chevalier
coster and cold corpse. Mr. Kipling’s gruesome poem
is followed by a clever story, “ Mees,” by George
Fleming. Here, although the scene is laid in Venice, the
heroine talks of “a bullet through the ’eart,” and pulls at
her black gloves and curdles your blood, although she
talks about the drorin’-room and a hempty ’ouse. The
next page to this story of blood and sorrow is devoted to
two more leering, jeering devils, with lolling tongues.
There are some small devils on the next, and a horrible
devil all by himself on the next page to that, and still
another devil over the leaf. The next story is a humorous
fairy tale, of which the following, taken haphazard, is a
specimen: “He laid his finger on the rigid h md. It was
quite cold. ‘Your kingdom is not of this world,’ he
whispered. Then he extinguished the candles one by one,
and left the old man in the darkness." After the fairy
tale comes a Christmas story by a lady. The hero,
finding himself pressed by his creditors, and being dis-
appointed in getting a w ealthy heiress, gives a little supper
party to his landlady and creditors, and sits behind a
screen until his health is proposed. Then the servant
removes the screen, and the young gentleman is
discovered. His head was thrown well back, and the
blood was flowing from his throat, which w'as cut from
ear to ear. “For a moment there was silence. With
their glasses uplifted, they stood as if transfixed. The
girl standing by saw as if in a dream that on the sheet of
paper by the inkstand was written, ‘ Gentlemen , I think
you will own that your claims are settled."' The
unanimity with which all these Pall Mall people cele-
brate Christmas by dying is really remarkable. Mr. Barry
Pain, who is a humourist, follows, and he evidently feels
like a funny man in an undertaker's shop. He introduces
us to another Cockney heroine in the shape of a caretaker
who is left in charge of a house on Christinas Day while
the family go out to dine. When the family return they
find her sitting in the kitchen, and they shake her and
call her names, and then discover that, like everybody
else in the number, she, too, is a corpse. If we continue
to advance along the present lines I shall expect next
year to open a Christmas number and find that the
double-page supplement is a beautifully-coloured picture
of Hell.
A curious case is reported from Tallan-
gatta (N.S.W.). A man was out driving when
the horses bolted for four miles before he could
pull them up. No damage was done, and the
driver went about as usual. On the fourth day,
however, the man became totally blind, and, after
a brief illness, died —of shock to the nervous
system.
Colemane & Sons’ Eucal. Loz. are for the voice.
Two new books iu Macmillan’s admirable
colonial library are “ Adventures in Mashona-
land,” by two hospital nurses, Rose Blenner-
hassett and Lucy Sleeman; and “Marion
Darche,” by F, Marion Crawford. The former
fails to justify English encomiums, being for the
most part dull diary detail of tiresome trivialities.
There are some redeeming comment-touches :
The Bishop of Mashonaland’s exits were always effec-
tive ; he evanesced rather than went, alwaj'S at the right
moment, and left behind him a little hush in which one
would place a note of admiration.
Cecil Rhodes has a “Roman-emperor type of
head,” and
Whatever happens in Africa, people shrug their
shoulders and say; “It will be all right; Rhodes will
square it.
Selous, the lion-hunter, has a reputation through-
out Africa as “the man who never tells a lie.”
Hence the current libel-action against Labouch&re
who spoke strongly of Selous’ part in the Mata-
bele loot. There are also some good lion-stories ;
and this, which looks like an old friend :
A prospector arrived at Umtali whose name was Mr.
George Dam. He walked into a bar and asked for a drink.
“ Haven’t I seen you before, mate? What’s your name ? ’
said one of the men standing by. “ Name ? - oh, Dam !’’
was the answer. “ D yourself,” retorted the other,
“ what’s your name ? ” “Dam, I tell you!” Unholy
adjectives flew round. “What’s his name?” “Won’t
he give his name?” “What is your name?” roared the
whole assembly. “Dam!” shrieked the prospector, for
the third time. This was more than could be endured.
A free fight ensued ; there were many black eyes walking
about next day; and it was some time before the town
settled down again.
But, on the whole, the narrative is bald and un-
attractive. And the best yarns of Rose and Lucy
are not in their book. One tells how they lost
their luggage, and had to wear men’s clothes,
Mashonaland importers not providing for women
in 1891. Rhodes heard of this, and wired to
Jameson, Mashonaland administrator: “Hear
nurses have no clothes. Provide at once.” Jameson
wired back: “They are the best-dressed women
in Mashonaland.” Which was true enough, seeing
that in Mashonaland the women don’t dress.
Another yarn tells how for fun the nurses pegged
out a Mashona claim, choosing an old working for
purely picturesque reasons. After their return to
England, much to their astonishment, a syndicate
purchased their claim for .£7OO, and floated it.
Marion Crawford’s new book has an old plot,
made endurable by fresh treatment. The conver-
sations which fill the pages are wonderfully dex-
terous and clever. There are occasional felicitous
phrases of the kind which Crawford can make
better than almost anybody :
Dolly was a good girl, though she had too many “pur-
poses ” in life.
“ What is good nature?” “ A combination of laziness
and vulgarity—the vulgarity that wishes to please every-
body, and the laziness that cannot say no.”
Vanbrugh’s proposal and the description of the
American interview are the best things in the
book; which in our case derives additional
piquancy from the manner in which the sheets
have been carefully mixed by the binder.

Out in the middle of a great western plain a
traveller has thrown himself down for an hour’s
sleep. He has_ not troubled to make an orderly
camp; he has just hobbled his two horses, kicked
a few tussocks of grass out of the way of his hip,
rolled his blanket around him and, with his head
upon his upturned saddle, tried to rest. At the
last water the tracks of the blacks had been thick
and fresh, so, after watering Ids horses, he had
preferred riding on a mile or two in the dark and
camping, without fire, on the open plain. No
great hardship, for the night is sultry and sullenly
6 Vr‘ i r m n
No place for silence like a great plain at night-
time, ihe same wide boundary surrounds you as
on the sea, but the sea is ever restless, the plain
forever still. Every dash and ripple of the waves
makes a phosphorescent flash, or a shimmer of
reflected stars ;but the plain is dull, dead and
unresponsive. Ihe myriad lights oerhead are the
same, but yet different. When they dip to tne
westward they lose their radiance in the earth-
haze and their lustre is quenched ere they die.
At sea they burn to the horizon; on the plain the
earth taints them and they pa e.
And there is the silence, the great silence and
stillness of earth without life. The constellations
may change their declinations as they pursue
their courses, but they are always the same—cold,
passionless, cruel, and regardless of the petty
tragedies they witness. The watcher, encircled
by vast shadows, feels strangely glad when the
great beams of the morning star herald the grey
light of day
So thought the tired man, who yet could not
sleep, although, when he dismounted, the hardest
rocks had seemed to him as a bed of down. But
ghosts had come and gone out of the darkness,
ghosts unbidden had kept a long vigil with him
and only vanished when Time sleepily turned his
glass and bade another day to awake.
He was still a young man to be so haunted, and
with the first breath of morning wind which stole
faintly across the plain he arose and shook from
him the phantoms. Some of them. One or two
were not to be dismissed, but pursued him through
the hot glare of the day.
It was with some satisfaction that the traveller
at last saw beneath the western sun the rude
buildings of the cattle-station he was making for
Mud and thatch in those districts served in place,
of the familiar slabs and bark, and the stockyard
would have shocked the nice sense of any well-
constituted fencer. For straight sticks were rare
and the most perversely crooked timber had to
be pressed into the service.
“ Back at last, old man,” said a man advancing
to meet him as he rode up and somewhat wearily
dismounted.
“Yes,” returned the new arrival, “and have
done no good.”
“ No trace to be found anywhere ?”
“Not a sign. I went to Buglethorp and Yentnor
Downs, but nobody had seen anything or noticed
any unusual tracks.
“Deuced hard lines to have all our horses
cleared off like this. None of the other stations
touched ? ’
“ No. The d—d thieves seem to have made an
especial set at us. It’s the biggest mystery I ever
came across.”
“ Well, come in and have some grub, at any
rate.”
Letting the liorses go, the two men entered toe
hut, into whicli the cook had just carried a very
primitive meal.
A strange thing had happened : nearly every
available riding horse on the station had disap-
peared. It was evident that they had not strayed
away, but must have been stolen, and so cleverly
that no defined track could be found leading any-
where, Dufresne, one of the partners, had just
returned from a weary round to the two neigh-
bouring stations, in the faint hope of picking up
some information. Out of some thirty or forty
horses, they were left with five, which happened
to be in use and had been kept close to the station
when the raid was made.
Neither Dufresne nor his partner, Drummond,
was much inclined for conversation that evening.
The loss was a serious one to them, for the pioneer
squatters of those days had a hand-to-mouth
struggle. Dufresne, too, was tired and soon sought
refuge in his blankets
it mU st have been the middle of the night when
he suddenly awoke with the not uncommon
belief that someone had just spoken to him.
“Drummond!” he called out to his partner,
“ Did you speak
“No,” answered the other, sleepily.
“ Devilish queer ! I could have sworn somebody
spoke to me just now and woke me up. ?,
“ i t wasn ’ t i j un i ess L talked in my sleep> ..
<(T . it. . . t-, -

\Ve 11 make an early start in the morning,
We ve •) ust enough horses left for three of us, for
yours must be pretty well tied up.”
Botl * ,n ? n soon sle P t > bufc Dufresne tossed and
muttered in his sleep.
Fifteen miles from the station, straight back
from the river, was a jumbled mass of basalt, an
insurmountable obstacle forming a perfect natural
boundary some 20 miles long and varying in
breadth from three to five miles. Strange stories
were told about “The Wall,” as it was called,
Lakes were said to exist in it; those who had
camped near it said that they had been awakened
a t night by low rumbling sounds and earth
tremors. The blacks took to it when hard
pressed, but could not live in it, for there was no
game, and the rugged basalt cut their feet to
pieces. The whites had, on several occasions,
tried to penetrate it without success, so
that Dufresne’s notion that the horses
were concealed there seemed rather improbable.
Both Drummond and he knew, however, that
along the edge of the wall were many dips and
pockets forming natural paddocks, many of them
with narrow entrances, hard to find without care-
Ini search. If there was water in one of those, the
horses could easily be concealed there for months
until the coast was clear,
“ What’s up with you ?” said Drummond to his
partner as they rode on their errand next morning.
Dufresne was in the highest possible spirits ; as
Drummond remarked, he seemed more as though
he was riding to a pleasure gathering than in pur-
suit of horse-stealers. Even the black boy who
accompanied them looked strangely at him, his
laughter was so incessant.
The dark line of the wall soon loomed before
them, and shortly afterwards they were riding
along the edge of the grim barrier. The plain ran
smoothly to the verge of the rugged pile of basaltic
boulders, but Dufresne called out not to
bother about tracks, but follow him —he knew
where he was going to. Drummond could
do nothing but comply, concluding that his
partner had suddenly gone mad. In about six
miles they came to a place where the basalt
extended far into the plain, in comparatively level
sheets. Dufresne rode on to the rock and turned
towards the wall. He pointed downwards. No
tracks were visible, of course, but on the bare
rock were evidences that horses had been there.
Still led on, apparently by instinct, Dufresne
kept straight for the wall, and when they were
close to it a masked opening, narrow in the
extreme, was visible. Threading this in single
file and dodging amongst the boulders, they kept
on until they emerged on the edge of a large
pocket of open country. The entrance had been
roughly but securely blocked by boulders and
saplings. Dufresne pointed to these and laughed
loudly. Drummond and the black boy dis-
mounted and removed the obstacles. As they
rode down this natural paddock they recognised
their lost horses feeding about, and in the distance
the timber of a creek was visible.
“That must be the creek they talk of,” said
Drummond, “ the blacks say it only runs at
night.”
Dufresne did not answer—only pointed to a
white object under one of the trees, evidently a
ent. They made for it. Nothing stirred as they
approached—not a sign of life was visible. The
ashes of the fire were cold and dead, and the
tumbled blue blankets in the tent had not been
slept on during the past night.
“ No saddle or bridle,” said Drummond, looking
about the camp, “our man is on the warpath
again.”
Dufresne had been turning over some of the
loose objects in a valise that had formed the
sleeper’s pillow. “ Might as well find out the
beggar’s name,” he muttered. Drummond thought
he saw him slip something into the breast of his
shirt, but his manner had been so queer that
morning that he refrained from comment.
They mustered the horses and started home-
ward, but after getting through the narrow
entrance Dufresne pulled up.
“ I’m going back, Drummond,” he said. “You
and Jacky can take the horses in. I’m going back
to wait for that fellow ; it teas that man Staines.”
“ Rot!” returned Drummond, “there’ll be more
than one of them. One man didn’t get these
horses here single-handed. We’ll both stop if you
like.”
“No. There’s only one man camped there now,
and he won’t venture back until after dark. I
shall have him on toast. You let me have my
way.”
Drummond reluctantly left, and Dufresne turned
and rode back to the deserted camp, first replacing
the boulders and saplings.
Darkness, the semi-darkness of a clear starlit
night, closed in on the watcher, the noise of the
running creek seemed to grow louder as the hours
of silence drew on, until at last the tramp of a
horse told that his vigil was about to be rewarded.
The rider dismounted at the camp, quickly un-
saddled, and commenced to kindle the fire. The
dry sticks he put on soon burst into a blaze and
be arose from his crouching position and gave a
sudden cry of alarm. On the opposite side of the
fire stood Dufresne covering him with his re-
volver.
“Now, Mr. Staines,” he said, “your little game
is up.”
“So it seems,” returned the other suddenly.
“ Better complete your bloody work by murdering
me as you did my sister.”
The hand holding the pistol faltered and then
grew steady. Dufresne slipped his left hand
inside Ids shirt and pulled out an envelope. “Is
the photograph inside this envelope your sister?”
“ Yes.”
“ How did she die?”
“Like many other ruined girls die. First she
threw her baby, your child, into the water—made
a murderer of herself—then jumped in afterwards
and drowned herself.”
Dufresne never flinched, “Did you steal our
horses out of revenge ?”
“ I did, and went out to-day to try and get the
rest; then, when I caught you out on foot looking
for them, I’d have shown you little mercy.”
“You have got the family temper, but not so
much pluck,” said Dufresne with a sneer ; and, as
if in contempt, he lowered the pistol. In an in-
stant Staines, as active as a cat, had sprung across
the fire and grappled with him. Dufresne might
possibly have twisted his hand round and shot
him, but for some reason he refrained. They
struggled silently, well matched. Suddenly there
came a low, rumbling sound, the ground trembled
for a moment, then, with a faint sigh as though
the earth was sick, it passed away.
The combatants paused. Dufi-esne was the first
to recover and taking Staines unprepared, tripped
and threw him.
“Lie quietly there,” he said, panting, “or you’ll
never get up again.”
There was silence while the two men recovered
breath ; then Dufresne spoke again.
“ For reasons of my own I won’t hand you over
to the police for horse-stealing, but give you a
chance to clear out.” Here he stopped and took
the revolver from the man’s pouch. “Is this all
the firearms you have?”
“Yes,” was the reply, but Dufresne did not
look in his eyes. “I will leave it on one of the
rocks at the entrance,” he said; “lie there and
don’t move at your peril until I leave the camp.”
He went to where his horse was tied up behind a
neighbouring rock, mounted, and rode back past
the camp.
He was still within the firelight when Staines
, sprang to his feet and rushed into his tent. Next
moment there was the report of a gun and
Dufresne dropped with a charge of shot in his
back.
The murderer approached cautiously.
“Come here,” said Dufresne faintly, but every
word was audible. “I won’t shoot you, though I
could. I was married to your sister, but you
knew her passionate temper. We quarrelled
violently, parted, and, in my rage, I told her that
I would never acknowledge her. An empty
threat, of course, for she could always have
proved our marriage, and I meant to make it up,
but, unfortunately, she knew no better and
believed me.”
Dufresne paused ; then, in still lower tones, he
went on: “It’s in the blood, I suppose. She
killed herself and her child, and now you’ve
murdered me.”
Drummond was not long in looking up his
partner, but when they found his body they also
found a lunatic taking care of it in the solitude of
the basalt wall.

Revenge —An attempted salve'to wounded
vanity (or egotism),
Henniker Heaton has given notice of a
motion in the Commons which, if carried, will
have the effect of substituting physical for mental
excellence as qualifications for army and navy
examinations. This is a step backwards ! The
day of physical worth in military matters is over.
The brain, not the biceps, will rule the roost hence-
forth.
No. 1 of the Umtali Advertiser is to
hand, cyclostyled on Bpp. post 4t0., in far-away
Mashonaland. The paper “ will be conducted on
entirely independent principals, apart from poli-
tical bias, and reports will be plain, unvarnished
statements of what has actually occurred.” There
is a correctly-spelt French phrase, and a list of
Umtali wholesale prices, from which: Ceiling
boards, 2s. per foot;, deals, 2s. ; iron, 2s. 3d. ;
dynamite, 1505.; kerosene (10 gals.) 955.; candles,
3Js. per case; milk, 725. per case; bacon, 2s. 3d.
per lb.; pickles, 30s, per doz.; sugar, 745. per cwt.;
flour, 70s. per 1001 b. ; corned beef, 48s. per cwt.;
matches, 9s. per gross ; brandy 955. whisky 655.,
beer (quarts) 1725., champagne (quarts) 2205. per
case : cigarettes, 555. to 755. per 1000.
The most suspicious-looking item in the
list of subscriptions sent to David Syme by his
admirers is one which reads: “Journalist, £25.”
Now, no journalist ever had .£25 all at once, and
there is very little probability that any journalist
ever will have it. Therefore, either the money
was not sent, or else the sender wasn’t a journalist.
As the money obviously was sent it is necessary to
fall back on the latter hypothesis ; it was for-
warded by someone who thought he was a
journalist but wasn’t one. The man who oftenest
thinks he is a journalist, but isn’t one, is the
newspaper proprietor; moreover, he is the only
person, among the very few people who have a
diseased yearning to pass for journalists, who
ever has £25. These unhappy coincidences point
straight at Mr. Syme, and the only point in his
favour is that he must know, out of his large ex-
perience of journalists, that there has never been
£25 in the whole fraternity, and even if there was
a big newspaper-owner is the very last person they
would send it to.

“ Sez You.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN].
When the heavy sand is yielding, backwards from
blister’d feet,
And across the distant “timber ” you can see the
. flowing heat;
When your head is hot and aching and the shade*
less plain is wide,
And it’s fifteen miles to water in the scrub th®
other side—
Don’t give up, don’t be down-hearted, to a man' 8
strong heart be true !
Take the air in through your nostrils, set your lips
and “see it through,”
“For it can’t go on forever, and I’ll have my
day !’’ says you.
When you’re camping in the mulga and the rain
is falling slow,
While you nurse your rheumatism ’neath a patch
of calico;
Short of tucker or tobacco, short of sugar or of
tea,
And the scrubs are dark and dismal, and the plains
are like a sea;
Don’t givenp and be downhearted —to the soul of
man !
Grin ! if you’ve a mate to grin for—grin and jest
and don’t look blue,
For it can’t go on for ever —“ And I’ll rise some
day,” says you.
When you’ve tramped the Sydney pavements till
you’ve counted all the flags,
And your flapping boot-soles trip you, and your
clothes are mostly rags,
When you’re called a “ city loafer,” shunned>
abused, moved on, despised—
Fifty hungry beggars after ev’ry job that’s adver-
tised,
Don’t be beaten! Hold your head up! To
your wretched self be true ;
Set your pride to fight your hunger ! Be a man
in all you do !
For it cannot last for ever, and I’ll rise again !
says you.
When your “dossing ” out in winter—in the dark-
ness and the rain—
Crouching, cramp’d and cold and hungry ’neath a
seat in the “Domain,”
And a cloaked policeman stirs you with that
mighty foot of his—
“ Phat d’ye mane ? Phat’sthis? Who are yer ?
Come, move on—git out av this! ”
Don’t get mad; ’twere only foolish; there is
nought that you can do
Save to mark his beat and time him—find another
hole or two;
“ But it can’t go on for ever, I’ll have money
yet! ” says you.
Bother not about the morrow—for sufficient to the
day
Is the evil (rather more so). Put your trust in
God and pray !
Study well the-ant, slow sluggard. Blessed are
the meek and low.
Ponder calmly on the lilies—ho*" they idle, how
they grow.
A man’s a man ! Obey your masters ! Do not
blame the proud and fat,
For the poor are always with them, and they can-
not alter that.
Lay your treasures up in Heaven —cling to life
and see it through !
“For it can’t go on for ever; I will die some
day,” says you.

“Bill’s Yarn—and Jim’s.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I.— Bill’s Yarn.
“You don’t believe in ’em?” said Bill. “I
didn’t, either —one time. But if ever you see one
—like I did—and you lose your girl through it —
like I did—you’ll believe in ’em right enough, I
promise you ! ”
“ Did the girl see it too, Bill ? ”
“My word.”
“Were you scared ? ”.
“Was I scared! Would you be scared if you
saw six foot long of ghost coming at you ? ’’
“ Tell us about it, Bill.”
“ Well, mind you, this is a true yarn, and you’d
better make up your minds there’s nothin’ funny
in it. And there’s nothin’ to laugh at in it,
either. So, if any of you fellows wants to laugh,
he’d better start now, and we’ll go outside an’ see
whether he can give me a hidin’ or I can give him
one. Lend’s a match.” And Bill lit his pipe.
We promised Bill that we would take his yarn
seriously, because we could see he would be
annoyed if we didn’t, and Bill scales 12st. 131bs.
“ They was havin’ races at Bogalong,” said Bill,
“at the pub. And there was a little girl working
there that I was shook on, name of Mary—Mary
—darned if I don’t forget her other name. Now,
that’s curious, too! Mary—well, no matter.
Never mind her other name. But I thought a lot
of that girl those days. There was a jockey,
though, named Joe Chanter, and I always thought
he was the white-headed boy with Mary, and I
had no show. But she was only stringing him on,
after all. Only Joe never found it out. He was
ridin’ a colt for the publican this day in the
Maiden, and the colt bolted and ran into a fence
and chucked Joe, and they picked him up with
his face stove-in and his neck broke. He wasn’t a
bad sort, Joe ; a long, slim chap he was—tall as
me, but thin— some of you chaps might ha’ knowed
him? No? Lend’s a match.
“Mary didn’t seem much cut-up over the acci-
dent, though she was keeping the.other women
company in howlin’ most of the afternoon. But
all the women cheered up a bit after supper, and
it was decided not to put off the dance at night,
because there was a great crowd there, and the
publican said it didn’t matter about Joe—Joe
wouldn’t mind. Landlord was thinking about
what he’d lose, you see, if they broke up the party.
So they cleared the kitchen, and the fiddles played
up, and at it they went. Now, I never was much
of a dancer, and Mary wasn’t dancin’, either; she
was helpin’ in the bar ; so I went in and talked to
her instead. By-and-by I got her to come away
and sit in the best parlour with me. There was
nobody there, and we sat down on the sofa, and
got a bit confidential, and she said, when I asked
her wasn’t she shook on Joe, ‘No, indeed, not on
Joe.’ There was somebody else—she said. I
asked her who was he? She says, ‘A lot you care !’
‘ Indeed Ido care a lot, Mary,’ I says. * I don’t
believe you care anything at all about mo,’ she
s.-iya, half crying. ‘Why,’ I says, ‘Mary, you
ought to know (an’she did know, too, only she was
foxin’) that there’s nobody in all the world I do
care about except you.’ Then she began to say
something, but couldn’t get it out for crying, an’
I cut in. ‘Don’t you know, Mary, that I love
you?’ ‘I don’t know,’ says she. ‘Well, I do,
then,’ I says, ‘more than anything else in the
whole world. Tell me, do you like me a little?’
(I got that out of a book I’d been readin’. Sounds
silly rot, don’t it ? Lend’s a match.)
“ ‘ Yes, I do, Bill,’ says she, ‘ and I never liked
anyone else.’ . . . Well, then, of course, you
know what a fellow’ll do when a girl talks that
way, and they’re by themselves. By the Lord,
boys, it was a treat to kiss that girl. She was
just an armful of loveliness. Funny thing I can’t
think of her name. The music was going it out
at the back all the time, and they were dancin’
away no end. Presently Mary says she’d have to
go; she might be wanted ; and, of course, I said
she’d have to give me another kiss before she went.
And she was just doin’ it, when, all of a sudden,
she turns white an’ says—
“ ‘Oh, Bill, how wicked we are!’
“ ‘Why, Mary,’says I, ‘what’s wicked about
this lot ?’
“ ‘ Just think, Bill,’ she says, ‘here we are,
talkin’ love and kissing, an’ poor Joe Chanter
lyin’ dead in the very next room 1’
“ ‘ Great Scott !’ says I; ‘is he?’ and then Mary
began to cry and laugh both together like, but she
was hardly started when I hears an almighty
bump on the floor in the next room, and then we
both looks up, and there was Joe ! He was stand-
ing at the door, wrapped up in his windin’-sheet,
and his face was covered with blood. Mary gave
one yell and ran out by the other door, and me
after her, like blazes ! Scared ? Now, wouldn’t
that ha’ scared you? Lend’s a match.”
“ Well, and what was it, Bill ?”
“Great Lord, ain’t I tellin’ you! It was Joe /
Can’t a man trust his own flamin’ eyesight ?”
“ And what happened after?’’
“ Nothin’. Joe was dead enough when the rest
came in and looked, and they wouldn’t believe
what I told ’em. Only Mary wouldn’t look at me
next day—seemed frightened like—so I came
away. I’ve never been to Bogalong since.”
We all thought Bill’s yarn a very unsatisfactory
one, but we couldn’t get any more out of him. But
six months afterwards I heard Jim’s yarn.
ll. —Jim’s Yarn.
“ Bogalong?” said Jim, “Yes, I’ve been there,
and I don’t want to go there any more. It was a
bit funny, though, all the same. Oh, all right,
I’ll tell you about it.
“ I’d just delivered a mob of stores at Pilligi,
and as I was cornin’ back, I made Bogalong about
dusk. I thought I might as well be a swell for
once, havin’ a bit of stuff, so I reckoned I’d stay
at the pub. all night. So I put my horse up, and
had a drink, and asked if I could have a bed.
But the place was full up—they’d been havin’
races that day—and they said there was no bed
for me, so I was goin’ away. But the publican
called me back —l s’pose he guessed I had a
cheque on me—and said he’d find room for me
somewhere. ‘There’s a double bed,’ says he,
‘if you don’t mind sharin’ it with another man !
He’s a very quiet fellow,’ he says; ‘l'll
answer for him not disturbing you.’ So I said
all right, and after I had a few more drinks I
went to bed. They had a dance on, but I wasn’t
in the humour for dancin’, for it was a hot night,
and I was tired. The other fellow must ha’ been
that way, too, I thought, for he was in bed
already, I saw, when I went in. I didn’t take
much notice of him, except that he seemed pretty
well covered up, for such a hot night. But after I
put the light out, an’ lay down, I found that I’d
have to cover up, too, or else the mosquitoes would
eat me. So I pulled the sheet off the cove an’
rolled it round myself, and went to sleep. But
the noise of _ the music and the dancin’woke me
up after a bit, and I lay awake, growlin’ a bit to
myself for a time, an’ was just goin’ off again,
when I heard someone talkin’ in the next room.
I had left the door open, an’ could hear quite
plain. I was goin’ to sing out to them to clear
out, or shut the door, or something, but when I
heard what they were sayin’, I thought it was too
good, to miss, so I listened. It was some fellow
dom a mash with a girl, and I couldn’t help
laughm to myself to think how mad he’d be if he
knew somebody was listening. He was pretty
solid with_ the girl, I could tell, and by and-by he
started kissin’ her, an’ I nearly burst myself
laughm when that began, and he called hersweet-
heart, and darling, and all that. I was goin’ to
wake up my mate, and let him share the fun, but
I thought they might hear me, so I lay very quiet,
until presently the girl says, ‘ Oh, Bill! and poor
Joe lym dead in the very next room !’
‘‘l shoves out my hand as quick as lightning,
and feels for my mate’s face, and—Great Lord ! it
was as cold as a snake !
l ‘Holy Wars !’ I says, and I gives one bound
out of bed, forgetting all about the sheet bein’
wrapped round my legs. I came down an awful
buster, and my nose hit the side of the bed, and
started to bleed like a waterspout. But I picked
myself up and made for the door, and then I saw
the fellow and the girl sitting together on the sofa,
\, he y had one look at me—l was still rolled up in
the sheet, and the blood was running down my
face and then they cleared. By Jove, they did
travel! I got my clothes on—l didn’t much care
about going in for them, though—and went out to
the stable and got my horse and took the road for
went on to Blind Creek, and camped there.
But you’d ha’ laughed to see how them two

The Last of Six
Tales of the Austral Tropics.
By ERNEST FAVENC.
With Prefatory Note by JRolf Boldreivood.
OjiiM-ioxis of ■fcla.e Press :
“ The volume takes its name from one of the sketches, ‘ The Last of Six.’ though hi point of merit they all stand pretty well on a par The
author, who is familiar with life in Northern Queensland, writes with vigour about the doings of the whites and the natives in these'faraway
parts. A strong vein of mysticism runs through his narratives, and there are ghosts in almost every chapter, and for those who are fond of
realistic work the volume will prove attractive reading.”—S.M. Hkkat.d, July 8, 1893. r
“No writer has given the world a more vivid description of Australia and its wilderness than Ernest Favenc, and the secret of thl - k tl • t
he has, by many years’ experience of travel and bush life, acquired a knowledge of this continent which is possessed'by scarcely anv other wr'/ 1
He, too, possesses great descriptive powers. Whatever he puts yento is certain to be good. In the stories under notice he has siL
his best work. That they will be widely read is certain.”- Sydney Mail, July 8, 1803. glven us solne of
