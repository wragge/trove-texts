The Red Page
Too Little Science
The article “Too Much Kindness,” by
Lester Way (R.P. 26/6/’24), calls loudly for
correction. Mr. Way’s attack is levelled at
“sentimentalists and pseudo-scientific educa-
tionists.” He has seen articles by some of
these on the Red Page lately. I had not —
till I read Mr. Way’s article, which is a
luminous example both of pseudo-science and
of sentimentalism.
Mr. Way affords us a striking example of
the use of a pseudo-scientific method in his
adoption of a classification which divides
mankind into two temperamental types—
extrovert and introvert. Examples, indeed,
may be found of two extremes of tempera-
ment. _ There are metaphysicians and
materialists, altruists and profiteers, poets
and pigs ; but the vast majority of men cannot
be so clearly labelled. There are examples
of poets of the power of Tennyson, of philo-
sophers of the calibre of Carlisle, who yet
had a very keen sense of the social values of
the material world. Also, Woodrow Wilson
was an American.
Bradley, in his remarkable book, “Duality,”
has brought a wealth of scientific knowledge
to bear on the problem of our origin. He
concludes that we have originated from two
primitive types of men—the roundhead and
the longhead—and inclines to the belief that
the longhead is a cretinism developed from
the original roundhead. But the blending of
these types has produced an infinite variety
in temperaments. Moreover, these tempera-
mental differences are basic —fundamental, not
environmental. Mr. Way’s theory that en-
vironment can convert a true extrovert into
a true introvert receives no support from
science. Differences in temperament are
apparent in the same -family and observable
in infancy. Because of this, children and
adults react differently to the same environ-
ment. It is certain that many carpenters
reared sons in similar environments in
Nazareth, but history records but one Jesus
Christ. In his explicit adherence to this
two-type theory, Mr. Way certainly errs.
But this error is of little practical import-
ance. The important and mischievous part
of his article lies in its implicit educational
doctrines.
It is difficult to get at Mi*. Way's exact
ideas on the subject of education. It is
always difficult to extract a clear meaning
from a mass of sweeping criticism and im-
pregnable platitude. But from certain of his
phrases it is obvious that he has reactionary
hankerings after the classics and the good
old days when the dutiful schoolmaster
taught harshly and cudgelled cruelly. In
effect he but gives us a revised version of the
250-years-old advice of John Locke: “If,
therefore, I might be heard, I would advise
that, contrary to the ordinary way, children
should be used to submit their desires and go
without their 'longings, even from their very
cradles.” It is the way of the reactionary
to denounce as a fad each new advance in
method. When Pestalozzi propounded the
doctrine that there are in the child-mind the
seeds of faith and love and innocence and
morality, he stirred holy horror in the souls
of thousands. “We have no such children
to educate,” wrote Caroline Frye, “and,
therefore, this book is useless to us.” She
proceeds to compare “this dream of Socinian-
ism” with these sentences from a Christian
author (Newham) : “No sooner do children
begin to act at all, but we discover how
universally sin has pervaded all the sources
of intelligence. There is a greater pleasure
in reflecting on the images of crime than on
the character of piety; the conscience is en-
feebled and oppressed ; its voice is stifled and
its actions perverted ; the imagination de-
lights to revel over scenes of iniquity and
is difficultly carried forward to anticipations
of future happiness.” Mr. Way is
merely feebly echoing these sentiments in
his gibes (“the supposed tenderness of the
child body and the supposed innocence of the
child mind”), and in his truly remarkable
utterance, “The child prepared to look for
kindness is badly prepared and foredoomed
to folly and filching.”
Finally, Mr. Way is of the opinion that
a course of social and educational cruelty
will lead a child to fall back into self-com-
munion, to find his own soul and to arrive
as a worshipper at the shrine of the Ideal.
Should such a course result in “merely life-
long misery and despondency,” it is simply
because “they had nothing in them; their
souls were barren.” Here is sentimentality
of the most monstrous kind —the abnormal
and the perverse. The truth is that harsh-
ness to children is criminal. Cruelty murders
the fledgling soul. The utmost kindness, the
rarest sympathy, the most delicate discrimi-
nation are vital to the culture of the child
soul. The old classical and disciplinary sys-
tem of education had this for its worst fault.
It neglected to develop the aesthetic side of
the child’s nature. Huxley, arraigning the
system in “Science and Education,” levels at
it this indictment. In effect, he says, we
say to our sons: “You will have to weary
your soul with work, and many a time eat
your bread in sorrow and bitterness, and you
shall not have learned to take refuge in the
great source of pleasure without alloy, the
serene resting-place for worn human nature
—the world of art.”
The age-old problems of education are to
fit the child for his social environment and
at the same time to develop to the utmost
his individuality. The old Greeks faced this
problem with characteristic commonsense.
“The whole life of man,” said Plato, “stands
in need of grace and harmony” ; and Aristotle
felt the same need. “Living happily and
beautifully” was his ideal. These men knew
that grace and harmony, happiness and
beauty do not flower from cruelty and misery.
They made the life of the Athenian youth a
full and happy one, the basic principle of his
education being a pleasurable activity and
self-expression. The results of this system
are seen at their best in the history of the
fifth century b.c. —a period of practical and
artistic achievement incomparably greater
than any preceding it. Education passed
through many dark days after that, none
darker than those of the classical discipli-
liarians. To-day, however, the position is
vastly improved. Psychology holds aloft the
light of science, and the powers of darkness
are being dissipated. Eyes cleared of the
mists of evil tradition lose their distorted
sense of perspective in a wider vision. The
most hopeful sign of the dawning of a new
day is the very tendency which Mr. Way
deplores. Science and sentiment are in accord
in pronouncing it a crime to break the
bruised reed or quench the smoking flax.
ALICE JACKSON.
Luther Burbank and Science
Recent experiments made by Pavlov, the
eminent Russian physiologist, seem to give
the lie to that modern heresy which declares
acquired characteristics uninheritable. In
less than half a dozen generations of white
mice Pavlov reduced from 300 to 5 the num-
ber of lessons necessary to teach them
run for a meal on the ringing of a bell, anc
he hopes, after another propagation or two,
breed a family that will respond to t
dinner-bell without any training.
Darwin made no sharp distinction betwe
somatic and germinal variation, the theo
of germinal continuity being originally attr
butable to Weismann, who believed th
germ plasm contained living matter whic
had come down in unbroken line ever sin
life originated on the earth, and was destinet
to persist as long as life persisted. The boc
was, as it were, the mortal part of organ
life, a mere vehicle for carrying the com
paratively immortal germ. This conee
altered the attitude of many biologists t
wards certain fundamentals connected wit
questions of heredity and evolution, am
Darwin’s theory of variation was no long
accepted in its entirety.
Luther Burbank, the “creator” of a spin
less cactus, a stoneless plum, a white blae
berry and many other horticultural marve
was as a youth a keen student of Darwii
ism, finding in the fields of Massachuset
evidence which ultimately made him postu
late that “heredity is the sum of enviroi
ment.” Migrating to California, where cl
matic conditions were more favorable to ex
perimenting, he made such capital out of th
sensitiveness and adaptability of that “com
mon denominator” of organic life, protoplasm
that he earned the title of “Wizard of Cal:
fornia.” One of his earliest contribution
to scientific knowledge was the disprovin
of the theory commonly held by botanist
that a cross between two species of plant
resulted in infertility, his plumcot being th
result of hybridising the distantly-relatet
parents, plum and apricot. Finding in natur
many instances of hybridisation, he believe*
it to be. a very common phenomenon, anc
one of the chief means of producing new
species. Natural selection brought aboir
differentiation of species.
Since the same great laws seem to operat
in plant and animal worlds, Pavlov’s experi
merit with mice supports Burbank’s attitud
towards the question of the inheritance o
acquired characters. While many eminen
biologists were subscribing to the new dogma
of non-inheritance, Burbank, who based his
life’s work on the theory they were denying
and gained his knowledge direct from Nature
herself, stood firmly for inheritance. He
postulated that all traits of all species were
acquired in response to environmental stimuli
and that to deny the transmission of new
characters thus acquired was practically to
deny evolution. If there is such a hard and
fast line between soma and germ, he argued
why is it possible to reproduce flowering
plants possessing reproductive organs (germ
plasm) from buds, pieces of stalk and fractions
of root (somatic plasm)? In his opinion
germ plasm is part of the general body of
a plant, and he denies the assertion that
qualities imprinted directly on that plasm
are transmissible while those imprinted on
the body plasm are riot.
While Gregor Mendel’s theory of inheri-
tance was still in obscurity, Luther Burbank
had discovered that hybrid forms allowed to
interbreed produced progeny which usually
showed a wonderful tendency to vary, some
of them travelling in one' direction,' others
in an opposite one, others again making a
new road by combining two old ones. It
was on this unannounced theory that he
worked to develop many novel types. Study-
ing the later history of hybrids, he found that
in connection with given characters—say,
shortness or tallness—the hybrid tended to
follow one parent (dominant) to the exclu-
sion of the other (recessive). Though he
5-j 0 110 rru, thematical calculations as Mendel
did, Burbank over and over again gave prac-
tical demonstrations of the truth of what is
called the Mendelian theory of inheritance
long before Mendel was known either to Bur-
bank or to any of the scientists. The stone-
less plum was one result of working out this
theory. Crossing a small, acrid and commer-
cially worthless but practically stoneless
plum with choice cultivated varieties through
many generations, he found that each imme-
diate cross resulted in dominant stone-fruit,
the recessive character of stonelessness at
which he aimed appearing only in subsequent
generations.
“Science,” says Von Baer, “is in its source
eternal; in its scope unmeasurable; in its
problem endless; in its goal unattainable.”
Life has protoplasm for its common denomi-
nator, science has a search for knowledge.
Persistence and mutability are attributes of
both protoplasm and the science of biology,
their scope is unmeasurable, their sourc-
eternal. Not only do we find scientists in
laboratories differing in regard to the great
fundamentals of life, but those two biologists
Henri Fabre and Luther Burbank, who lived
close to Nature all their lives, are at oppo-
site poles so far as the theory of evolution
is concerned. Fabre, engrossed with his
insects, completely denied the theory Bur-
bank, hybridising, selecting, in-breeding his
plants, could only explain life in terms of
Darwinism. Yet from the time of Aristotle
to the twentieth century there are few biolo-
gists who have failed to sense the eternal in

National Literature
What constitutes a national literature.
One of the most remarkable features about
men like Shakspeare and Emerson and Tur-
genev is their universality. Shakspeare cre-
ates the only Hamlet outside of Russian
literature, Emerson has vastly influenced
Britons and Germans as well as Americans,
and Turgenev has been read probably far
more outside of Russia than inside. These
writers go into the depths of human nature,
and these depths are common to au mankind.
It is only the superficialities of human
nature, the everchanging habits and customs
and conventions, that are local and common
only to certain nations of men. Writers like
those mentioned above write for mankind
quite irrespective of time or place. Writers
like' Charles Dickens, for instance, and Bret
Harte and Gorky, on the other hand, are local
and not universal. Dickens is intensely Eng-
lish, Bret Harte intensely American;
Gorky is before anything else Russian. _ Yet
it would be absurd to say that English litera-
ture owes more to Dickens than to Shaks-
peare; American literature more to Bret
Harte than to Emerson, and Russian litera-
ture more to Gorky than to Turgenev.
Yet it seems to be the prevailing idea in
Australia that if there is to be an Australian
literature it must run on the lines set by
men like Gordon, Paterson, Lawson and
Dennis. These writers are supposed to de-
scribe truthfully the most essential phases of
Australian life. But because of the limita-
tions of their ranges of view these men in the
future cannot ever rank as more than secon-
dary men. They are like the Bret Hartes
and O. Henrys ot America. They are Aus-
tralian, but their lack of universality, though
it might be an endearing quality, is certainly
never a literary virtue. Gordon writes of
horses, Paterson of jockeys and shearers and
drovers, Lawson of swagmen, Dennis of lar-
rikins. Many people hold that they sing the
real songs of this land, and that they get,
for all their crudeness and roughness, right
at the real heart of the nation. The ques-
tion is, Do they?
We have all got a very strong strain of
sentimentality running through us, and
writers like those just mentioned undoubtedly
do pander very pleasantly and agreeably to
that strain. We are all at heart idealists, too,
and we all idealise what we do not know.
We city folk, for instance, are all wont to
idealise the country life. We think it would
be fine to get away from these people about
us that we know so well, and the clang-
ing of tram-bells, and the dust and grit and
bustle, to the peace and freshness and clean-
liness of the country life. But when we have
lived the country life for a while it is dif-
ferent. Both time and distance are en-
chanters. Paterson sings of how “the life out
West has a strange inviting.” One some-
times wonders if it really has for anybody
who has actually lived there. Certainly when
the men from the country come to town they
often enough want to get away to the coun-
try again. But it is possible that this is so
because they feel awkward and out of things
in the town. They are like fish out of the
sea. And the country they have come from
might quite possibly be to them the lesser of
two evils. Lawson puts patriotism and kind
hearts into swagmen, and Dennis does the
same for the larrikins who live out then-
lives in the city slums. We do not put
patriotism and kind hearts into the city folk
with whom we have our daily dealings we
know them too well. We do not know swag-
men and larrikins, so _we can idealise them
and believe in idealisations of them. But let
us go and live with them for a while, and
the majority of us would soon be wanting to
get back to the company of the despised
city folk with whom we have our daily deal-
ings. It is absurd to think that if you want
to get at the great heart of humanity
you have to go on the land or into pal-
aces or city slums. Yet this is where the
lesser novelists and lesser poets would always
have us go. Gordon, Paterson, Lawson,
Dennis, like Bret Harte and O. Henry, please
and amuse, but they are not great intellec-
tual forces. They are not going to alter
or influence in any way the national charac-
ter. It is doubtful if they play any great
part nationally at all. Bret Harte must
have given pleasure to hundreds of thou-
sands of Americans. But Emerson must have
affected and influenced the life courses of
millions more. Bret Harte amused and enter-
tained the people. Emerson shaped for them
their struggling thoughts. Even people who
never read or could read his works would be
influenced by people who had been directly
influenced by* those works. The greater part
of the reading public of any country is made
up of middle-class city people, and it is the
man who writes of anywhere but the city and
of any people but middle-class city people
who has the greatest local public waiting
for his work. To these people the country,
the palace, the slum make the most dramatic
and picturesque appeal. But it is the deep
thought in a work that gives it its ultimate
literary value. It is that, too, that unlocal-
ises the work and gives it its universal
appeal. Bjornstjerne Bjornson was more
typically Norwegian and a more popular
writer in his day in Norway than Ibsen was.
But would there be a Norwegian literature
if there were no Ibsen? I think not.
The Australian Ibsen has not arrived, nor
the Australian Emerson. Some day they
will come. Then the other nations of the
world will awaken to the fact that there is
really an Australian literature. A national
literature would seem to be one that includes
all native-born or naturalised writers
whether they be poets, dramatists, essayists,
novelists, biographers, irrespective of what
parts of the world they write of or what
peoples or what subjects. If this is not so,
then Shakspeare does not belong to English
literature and Dickens does, and Keats and
Shelley do not —which is all rather absurd.
ALAN D. MICKLE.
Housing the People
There are to-day about eight million in-
habited houses in Britain, and to meet the
growth of population about 80,000 more are
needed each year. The problem thus created
is as old as civilisation. All that has hap-
pened of late lias been an intensifica-
tion of the difficulties; and for that the
Great War is almost wholly responsible.
After its conclusion so severe became the
pressure, despite the toll of life in the con-
flict, that Parliament was impelled to deal
with it in a comprehensive measure. An in-
structive account of the position before the
passing of the Housing and Town Planning
Act of 1919, an abstract of its provisions, and
the reasons why the steps taken to enforce
them effected so little, are contained in The
Houses of the Workers, by A. Sayle (Fisher
Unwin).
“Bad housing,” says the author, “is bad
policy, bad business and bad religion.” It
is, however, quite a modern view—and largely
a post-war view—that the housing of its
people in fit and sanitary premises is a ques-
tion for the State, and the burden not one
to be cast wholly on the individual. The
immediate causes of the shortage in England
and Wales Mr. Sayle traces to “the marked
decrease in the number of small houses
erected by speculative builders after the
passing of the Finance Act of 1910, which
introduced the Land Value Duties, and the
prohibition of all building not of ‘national
importance’ during the war.” A “housing
survey” was made by each Local Authority
showing the number of houses built during
the eight years 1911-18 inclusive, and the
result indicated that the number built in
each of these years had failed to keep pace
with the demand. Throughout that period
the birth-rate had decreased ; nevertheless, the
population had increased. Though the war
had killed, in round numbers, 700,000 British
men. it had not greatly reduced the number
of families needing homes. That was the
situation which had to be dealt with. The
Act of 1919 placed the obligation on the
Local Authorities — i.e., the County and
Borough Councils and the Urban and
Rural District Councils —to prepare schemes
and provide homes. In the event of failure
to do so the Ministry of Health had power
to carry out the work either directly or
through the County Council. The Govern-
ment on its part undertook to defray the
cost (in excess of the produce of a penny
rate) of all the housing and slum-clearance
schemes of the Local Authorities. The pow-
ers of the Authorities were enlarged with
regard to the fixing of the values of slums
purchased for clearance with a view of re-
building; also in the direction of granting
loans to owners to repair houses, and, in
the event of their failing to do so, to carry
out the work themselves and recover the
cost from such owners. The Act also en-
couraged “public utility societies” (generally
taking the form of co-operative tenants’ asso-
ciations) to enter the building field, by the
grant of loans and an annual subsidy equal
to 30 per cent, of tire loan charges. That,
broadly, was the solution of the problem
offered by the Act of 1919. “It was the big-
gest endorsement of the principle of com-
munal enterprise in housing ever made; and
it was passed because Private Enterprise,
through the Master Builders’ Federation, had
declared itself quite unable to provide houses
for the working classes, owing to the high
cost of labor and material prevailing in
1919.” , ,
No sooner had the Act been passed than
a change of front was made by the building
trade. It was represented that there were
a large number of individuals all over the
country who were willing and able to pay a
substantial proportion of the cost of build-
ing small houses, and that private builders
were ready to erect them, provided the Gov-
ernment paid a subsidy either to the future
owner or to the builder to cover the differ-
ence between the then cost and the future
value. The influence of this movement was
sufficient to secure a further measure of
legislation in the Housing (Additional Powers)
Act of the same year. _ In the case both of
the public utility societies and of these “sub-
sidy houses” greater latitude was given in
respect of accommodation and floor area than
was granted to the Local Authorities. They
were not controlled by the official inspector,
and were, there seems to be little doubt,
made the subject of traffic and speculation.
Nor did they in all cases meet the needs of
the working class. A number were either
rented or occupied as week-end cottages by
persons living in houses or flats elsewhere.
The local authorities, as a whole, met the
Act with apathy, if not with tacit opposi-
tion. The apathy was largely due to the
want of imagination associated with ultra-
conservative minds. Things as they stood
were to such minds the best possible under
existing circumstances. “If you put them
in palaces to-day,” said one, “they’d make
them pigsties to-morrow.” If it were
pointed out that the pigsty condition was
often due to leaking roofs, cracked walls,
broken privies and refuse pits—often not
emptied for months —the reply would be that
the owners could not afford to pay for
repairs. There the matter was allowed to
rest ■ no one was desirous of exerting pres-
sure' with the possible risk of the loss of popu-
larity. Political antagonism played its
part also ; and not infrequently some mem-
ber or officer of the Council was himself the
owner of doubtful properties, and did not
wish to meet the competition of these new
and better homes. So inertia, ignorance,
prejudice and personal interest did their best
to damn the scheme. Meantime the price
of building contracts soared, and the size and
convenience of these “Government houses
had to be reduced. The question of where
the money for it all was to come from was
soon raised. The surveys had shown that
824,709 houses were required. At the then
cost of £lOOO each, an outlay of £824.700.000
would have been reached. The inability
of the Treasury to find this vast amount
finally brought about the collapse of the
scheme. It is significant that at the
present time the same class of house could
be built, in the ordinary course of trade, for
about £5OO each. Not a little of the failure
was undoubtedly due to “the unhappy results
produced by trying to run idealists and
business men in double harness —the former
in blinkers, and the latter without.”
Garden-city enthusiasts, socialists, social
reformers, health pundits and so on all
had a finger in the pie. The builders, on
the other hand, seem to have possessed few
ideals, but much willingness to make money
out of this or any other national misfortune.
A new Housing Act was passed in 1923
making another attempt to deal with the
problem. Provision is still made for con-
tributions from public moneys towards the
expenses incurred by local authorities in pro-
moting building, or in building, provided the
houses are ready for occupation before
October 1, 1925. This assistance is, how-
ever, limited to a very small type of house.
Ambitious propositions are not encouraged.
Government aid towards the clearance of
slums has been whittled down, and in other
respects Treasury economies effected. But
the question is not yet at rest, for the
present Labor Government has its views
to be embodied in still further legislation.
The ideal has been expressed by a promi-
nent member of the House: “My dream is
an England in which every family will have
a house to live in fit to bring up children
in.”

Fossil Words
“English as she is spoke” is more wonder-
ful than most of us realise. Standard
English is the result of many centuries of
growth ; there is a continual pruning or lop-
ping off of words which have ceased to suit
the trend of national thought. But many
of these expressions that are disused in cul-
tured speech retain a firm hold on life, often
in disguise; many a word that formerly held
an honorable office in general speech has
become anathema to the purist, and is cursed
under the name of slang, or vulgarism.
Assuredly there is such a thing as slang
which is a taint; but just as surely there is
many a “common” expression which has a
reputable ancestry and a respectable use.
Doubtless when a small boy mentions that
some happening was “no end of a lark,” or
that he and some others were “larking”
about, his phraseology stands in need of cor-
rection, according to our usage. But in
point of fact he has unconsciously spoken
correctly, and has used a word which means
exactly what he intended it to mean. In
the days of Alfred, that young prince
“larked” with his brothers, though they
spelt it “lakode” at that time. There is a
so-called slang use of the word “hot” that is
as old as English. To remark of some per-
son’s conduct that “That’s pretty hot, any-
how,” may be considered a crude way of
expressing disapproval, but it has the sanc-
tion of antiquity. Our ancestors used the
term “aht” or “ohte” to mean brave or
daring; and, though it has been long absent
from classic speech, it leads at present a
busy and useful life in ordinary conversa-
tion. Again, when Kipling, in the “Ballad
of East and West,” put into the mouth of
the Colonel’s son
Ha’ 1 done., ha’ done;
Put up the steel at your sides,
he most likely thought, even as you or I,
that the word was merely a cut-short form of
“have” convenient in current speech. Actu-
ally, according to derivation, lie should have
written “a.” "The older language possessed
sucb a verb, meaning to have, the forms of
which were dispossessed by the better-known
“habban,” which became our present “have.”
Another expression-—not now very common-
has an interesting history. It is used in
speaking of a man who, after holiday, is
inclined to shirk work. He is “collar-proud.”
This is at first sight a figure of speech, re-
ferring to a horse’s unwillingness to pull
into the collar and take a fair share of ten .
But there is another word, collertertu,
which meant just “proud.” It appears that
when the newer word “proud” came into use
beside this older expression, the two were
put together and became one, each as a
translation of the other. Now T the force ot
“collar” has been forgotten, and the term
appears to us merely as a useful figure o
SD6GCh
“Doilishly pretty” is a description that
carries with it a certain disparagement, yve
take it that there is a comparison implicit
between the face of the woman ana a chai-
acterlcss doll. But there is an older word,
“dollice,” which meant quite bluntly that a
thing was foolish; and that was the one
that started the phrase. When the adjective
“hard” is used in expressions such as a nara
blow,” there is still a certain implication
of anger behind the action; and indeed the
original “hard” meant fierce. A commentary
on changing customs and altering view-
points is to be found in the words lovely
.and “gift.” A lovely thing is properly one
worthy of praise and esteem, from which
love is born. As to the other, gift mean
“the price of a wife,” and a gift rvas ers,
much a token of love and honorable mten-
Perliaps we might call such as these fossil
words —survivals of the earlier time. V'e
cannot reinstate them; sometimes it wouiti
hardly be desirable, and, anyhow, most or
them ‘have their work in their presen t places.
But it is interesting to know them for what
they are —no mushroom growth of a century
or so, but fine old commoners that go back
far towards the beginnings of our tongue.

The Joy of Succeeding
while you are still Young.
TWO men work equally
hard, and both succeed.
But to one man position
and independence come at thirty-
five; to the other not until sixty.
Success is sweet whenever it
comes; but at sixty the capacity
for enjoyment is less keen.
The travel that seems so
alluring at thirty-five has lost a
little of its charm, the distance
to the end of the road of life is
shorter; and many a man finds
fortune in his hands so late that
there is time only to arrange to
pass it on to someone else.
Happy is the man who finds
a way to save somehow the inter-
vening years; there is joy in
succeeding while you are still
young.
There is a way to save the
wasted years.
The reason why success
comes so late for most men is
that there is so much to learn.
Only a man who knows all
the different departments of
business is qualified to reach the
higher positions, or to enter
business for himself. And the
learning of all departments from
practical experience in each is a
matter of many years.
Is there no way to shorten
this process? Must every mans
life have so many wasted years?
Thousands of able men have
determined to eliminate those
wasted years from their lives;
thousands have found the answer
in the Alexander Hamilton Insti-
tute’s Modern Business Course
and Service.
For years the Alexander
Hamilton Institute has special-
ised in the single task of training
men for the higher executive
positions of business.
Into its Course have been
built the experience and the
methods which have made many
of to-day’s business leaders suc-
cessful.
Its subscribers appropriate
the knowledge of other men, and
profit by other men s mistakes
and successes. They learn in
months what ordinarily takes
years.
The experience of the most
successful made available to all.
Hundreds of successful
executives have testified that the
Alexander Hamilton Institute
has been a tremendous factor in
their success.
More than 27,000 directors
and business heads are numbered
among its 200,000 successful
subscribers, of whom nearly
2000 are in Australia and New
Zealand.
“In the past eight years,” one
man wrote recently, my income
has increased 750 per cent. The
Course has been the foundation
of my business training.”
Would you like to save the
wasted years? Would you like
to know the joy of rapid instead
of moderate progress —the joy of
succeeding while you are still
young? If so, this is the call of
opportunity to you; a moment s
decision is all you need.
Any man who is sincerely in-
terested in his future will clip

- Universal %ice of Civilisation
THERE is much evidence to prove that the existence of music is
coeval with mankind. It has come, through a slow, slow process
of evolution, from the crude percussion or rhythmic state of primal
times, to the modern art we know. As man’s intellectuality increased,
so his finer feelings expanded. His emotions became more complex
and demanded a greater means of expression. Many formal struc-
tures of sound-concords were reared, only to be swept aside by advancing civilization as
circumscribed and unworthy. A high degree of intellectuality was reached before our
modern scales were evolved, but now music rests on a sure base. It is a universal tongue
of civilization, capable of expressing the most profound emotion of the soul.
The love of music is an age-old inheritance. It made possible the development and
manufacture of an instrument like the New Beale. Here is an exquisite technique, in a
golden-voiced instrument; an interpretative combination with which the heights of the
most lofty musical conception can be scaled. It enables anyone to release all those surges
aeons old that clamor in his being for outward expression. This interpretative qual-
ity of the New Beale is possibly its greatest attribute. It is certainly the feature which
appealed strongest to the many musicians who have so enthusiastically endorsed it.
Interpretation and Style! These are better than mere notes and rhythm. And it is because
the New Beale is capable of personal and individual expression to a greater degree than
is very often contained in a course of arduous manual effort that it so surely appeals to the
true music lover. Sold on a liberal extended payment plan ; used instruments accepted

Mary’s Dream.
God was in a lilac mood ;
All the air about His feet
Breathed the quiet scent of good
In a mystery made sweet.
Very white His open hand,
Whiter than an angel’s bread
Or the star of Evening Land
Watching over Mary’s bed.
Mary’s face is morning-bright;
Sleep was surely good to her.
God had wrapped her all the night
In a dream of lavender.

The Dark Lover.
I sought Romance, sought late and long
The music of her magic song.
Drawn by one fleeting golden glance,
I sought in vain beyond the throng.
Though dim the lights grew, faint the
dance,
I sought Romance!
I heard her singing, sweet and far,
Past where the darkness rose to bar
My torch’s dreary radiance.
Through crypts of night without a star,
To light me with its quivering lance
I sought Romance.
She sang no more. I found her past
Night’s groping horror, blind and vast.
Her lips were locked in icy trance;
And one was there who held her fast —
Poor cheated Death, who sighed “Perchance
I sought Romance!”

The Second Love.
He loved her till she died, he said.
I think of her. Her lips were red
As mine are now; and, falling free,
Her silken hair shone to her knee.
Blue eyes she had. He said her eyes
Were bluer than blue dawning skies.
And, oh, her golden voice I hear
Ring mocking in my heart and clear!
A slim ghost girl, she smiles and peers
Still from the silence of old years ;
But, oh, ere death kissed her asleep
Love and the Spring had lapped her deep !
She had her hour; but her soul yet
Clings to him. He may not forget.
I hate her lovely laughing ghost,
The sweet dead woman he loved most!

The Black Swans.
O’er waters wide and golden
Beneath a windy sky,
Dark cohort after cohort,
The lonely swans drift by.
From East and North they number;
And swift, with necks unbent,
They take the yellow morning
Steadfast with one intent.
Oh, whither, whither sweeping?
And wherefore —who may know?
What old tryst arc they keeping,
A-fluting as they go?
And as I watch them swinging,
They seem singing
Soft and low:
“Over the hills and over the lake
(Blow, little wind, from the South!)
Where the bloodwoods dream in the ferny
brake,
This is the way, the way we take,
Down to the river’s mouth.
Green, oh green are the water-weeds,
Towed by the crawling tide
Over the ripples and over the reeds ,
Where the oozy banks are wide!”
From secret lakes they gather,
Where by the foetid pool
The scrawny scrub and tea-tree.
Stand pale o’er channels cool.
They see the mussels glimmer,
The speckled fish below%
The stingray in the shallows,
Where tidal currents flow.
On. on with wings a-glisten,
They glide; and as they veer,
They poise awhile and listen,
The big swan in the rear,
Their dark legs doubled under.
And I wonder
What they hear.
“Winging away and swinging away —•
Over the dunes is the sea!
Oh, we hear the splash as the skip-jacks play,
The wind in the dead boughs old and grey,
Bells where the slopes run free.
Wild with urge is that crooning voice
Out of the deep ajar, ,
Calling us on, and catling us on,
To the blue world over the bar!”
Soft night by night I watch them,
Gliost-blaclc against the moon,
A-beating up the shadows
By creek and lost lagoon.
I hear a silver fluting
Of voices in the dark
That call alone —together—
With music; and I hark.
For as they come low-swinging
That chorus wild and free
Seems but my own voice singing—
My own dumb song a-singing—
Crying, crying
Out of me:
“Out of the night where the blackness rolls,
Lift me up, little wing!
Oh, who can know of the distant goals,
Of us who sing of the lonely souls,
And are sad with the songs we sing f
Who can tell of the mystic dreams
Snared in the farthest star,
Calling us on, and calling us on
To the worlds where the lost suns are?”
VICTORIA.

A GREAT IDEAL—THE NO-HOUR
WEEK.
With a general election in sight, the making
of programmes has been given a brisk start
in N. S. Wales. The output so far has been
mostly composed of cries for Less Work and
More Pony-racing, though some sectarian
specimens are on the market. Labor-
leader Lang made his formal bid for the
Premiership a few weeks ago. He began with
absolute preference to unionists because they
are unionists, and without any obligation
on their part to show that they deserve a
preference. That is to say, the unions will
not be required to supply good workmen, or
sufficient workmen, or workmen who will
work; they are simply to have preference.
Next, he sketched an “industrial bank,”
which is to take in deposits if it can get
them, and lend the money out on the security
of two most uncertain forms of Private En-
terprise—to finance workmen’s co-operative
enterprises and to build homes. Other items
included the introduction or extension and
enlargement of everything which could pos-
sibly gratify the wage-earner, including un-
employment insurance, and especially a
comprehensive reversion to the idea of 44
hours’ work less holiday time, and 124 hours
off duty plus holiday time, per week. But
the industrial section of the party, which
threatens to break away and set up as a
separate institution if it can get strength
enough, has schemes before it which leave
LjANg at the post. He is practically a non-
starter. They include payment of the full
basic wage to all who are sick, injured, aged,
° ut of work or successful in avoiding work;
tne 44-hours week, when there happens to
oe a week; full maintenance of children till
they attain the working age, which is to be
lb; and the full pay of a capable and expert
adult to begin at the age of 18, the toiler
• T??*’ learned his trade, however intricate,
m 24 months. (Probably this is not meant to
apply all round, for the idea of a surgical
student beginning his training at 16, and
cutting off the leg of a Labor member at 18,
lie being the medico who reached the scene of
the accident first, has too many possibilities
about it.) The industrialists claim that
they are genuine workers when they do work,
an distinct from soft-handed hangers-
on like Lang, the property dealer; McTier-
nan and Sproule, lawyers; McGirr, boss
chemist and _ rich landlord; or Dooley, the
ex-master tailor. They are perfectly willing
that these anomalies should remain in the
Labor movement as rank and file, camp-
tollowers and baggage-carriers, but they de-
sire the billets and the big salaries for their
_ sort. . If the Communist party can be
admitted into the Labor army cn bloc, all
ranking as genuine industrial hard-workers
because they are Communists, it is reckoned
that there may be a change in the leadership,
or figureheadship, and that the ideal of pay-
ing the full and increased basic wage for a
AO-Hour Week may come to the front.
* * * *
Leaving the absolute No-Hour Week out
of consideration, the question is whether it
is possible for the manufacturer to pay 32
months’ wages for 11 months’ work (that be-
mg the difference between 44 hours per week
and the very reasonable 48 hours), plus
greatly enhanced taxes to meet the bill for
all manner of side-lines, and at the same time
for industry to expand, or even to avoid con-
traction. Two States which have prided
themselves for quite a while on being good
to the toiler in the matter of loafing time
are Westralia and Queensland. Comparing
the figures for the year before the war,
which was also the year before Queensland
took to semi-Bolshevik ways, with those
just out, relative progress has been after this
fashion i

It may be regarded as surprising that Vic-
toria, which imports the bulk of its coal
(for a long time it imported the lot), should
show so well; but Victoria has kept very clear
of Bolshevik ways, and it took to Protection
earlier than its neighbors. The progress of
►South Australia, which is bare of both coal
and water-power, is also remarkable; but
S. Australia doesn’t Bolsh, nor does it rave
after the doctrine of the No-Hour Week.
Queensland has coal for its own use and for
export, in which respect it and N. S. Wales
are in a category by themselves; in fact,
the northern province is furnished more pro-
fusely with fuel that even the Ma State. It
has likewise water-power and to spare, and
much of the richest soil in the Common-
wealth. But it fell into the hands of the
roaring Friends of the People in 1915, and
while that gang can manipulate the rolls and
count the votes it would appear to be a per-
manency. The Queensland artisan, in addi-
tion to being the only one with a vanishing
job, isn’t even specially well paid in the bit
of job that remains. Latest figures allege
that his average wage is below that of the
man in S. Australia, N. S. Wales or West-
ralia, and under the Commonwealth average.
* * * *
N. S. Wales manufactures would doubt-
less make a better showing but for the com-
parative stagnation which set in when the
Langs and Dooleys and McTiernans and
McGirrs arrived, clothed in all their arro-
gance and ignorance, to introduce bright
ideas imported from Moscow or copied from
Karl Marx. At June, 1920, when N. S.
Wales, like other places, had fairly resumed
business after the war, the number of factory
employees was 16,863 greater than it had
been a year before. In the next year, when
the Dooley-Lang Government was in full
charge, the increase was 557. During the
of another financial year (to June,
Dooley and Co. went out, and the
increase _in the number of factory workers
was 3865, and at June, 1923, there was a
further improvement of 3390. The record
of 557 in 1921 was the triumph of Dooley-
lsm — the complete Dooley, so to speak. And
the financing that the Dooleys did in the
struggle. to keep that which was almost as
bad as it could be from looking even worse
was a wonder. These figures are from the
latest N. S. Wales “Quarterly Statistical
Bulletin,’’ 1921 and 1922 being the Dooley
years:—
N.SVV. Loan Expenditure.
Irrigation,
Harbors, Rivers,
Year Railways and etc., classed as Not

1923 .. 4,669,285 3,301,918 1,822,816
A party which put up the loan record of
1921 and 1922, and had a big deficit each
year in addition, and left its famous wheat
guarantee unpaid, should give up professing
to have a policy. It can’t be trusted with
one. But its apostles preach their doctrine
of slow working and fast borrowing with all
their old assurance.
* * * *
There is a pleasant sensation of making
holiday and acquiring merit at the same
time about the theory that few hours and
slow hours make room for more wage-earners,
and that the man who does a reasonable day’s
work is a traitor to his caste. Where the
job is a necessary one and not competitive,
like the running of a railway system, the
plan may work, provided expenses don’t force
up charges to the point where trade begins to
leave off. But in other lines it does marvels
in the way of destroying manufacture for
export and even for local supply, for the
foreign importer comes in and crawls all over
the market, and people develop in a remark-
able fashion the habit of doing without
things. At a push half the families can do
even without houses —they can lodge on the
premises of other families. Consequently
few hours’ work per day is apt to signify few
workers, instead of the other way about.
The British person had the “limited output’’
idea long before the war, and it has been in-
tensified since, with the aid of the system of
doles, which represents the policy that these
Labor renegades preach carried far into prac-
tice. This helps to explain how it came
about that there were 132 blast furnaces going
in Britain in 1922 as compared with 338 in
1913, why the smelting business had dropped
by 60 per cent., and why the wool, cotton
and flax required to keep the British mills
going was only 2079 million pounds, whereas
in 1913 they required 3102 million pounds.
The Freetrade superstition has much ro
answer for, but that is a disease of long
standing, and it doesn’t account for the shock-
ing falling off in the output per worker dur-
ing very recent times.
LUXURY FOR PROFIT.
“Straw-hatted millionaires and multi-millionaires
invaded London on board the Majestic, the world's
largest and most luxurious liner, whose record list
of 884 first-class passengers included many of the
richest Americans. Pawning stewards, who had been
tipped with small fortunes, gazed hungrily after
the departing hosts. Orders in a nasal twang split
the atmosphere until three special trains bore the
vast army of social mannequins and complacent
‘dollar-king’ husbands to London.” —Sun cable.
Most of us are republicans—in theory. We
know that the idea of a hereditary monarchy
cannot he supported by logical argument—
that in all reason a superior ruler is to be got
by selective processes. Sensible people no
longer talk seriously of the “divine right of
kings,” and Use-majeste died as an offence
with the German Empire; so that when sub-
versive foreigners sneer at the mummeries
of Courts or denounce the snobbish extrava-
gance that impels monarchist nations to sup-
port herds of royalties in virtual idleness,
they usually have the discussion to them-
selves. In a similar spirit we are all Spar-
tans —sturdy upholders of the old Puritau
system of ethics. There is even a general
tendency to applaud prohibition—in an im-
personal way. An organisation called the
Business Men’s Efficiency League has lately
appeared in Australia —composed in about
equal parts of those who are non-drinkers
by preference and those who think that the
“workers” would be more efficient if they be-
came teetotallers—and many righteous drink-
ers who are not “workers” wish it well.
The same phenomenon is to be seen in
America, where some of the most eloquent
advocates of prohibition for others —and in
particular for the “workers”—are careful to
abstain from practising it themselves. It is
therefore perhaps not so remarkable that when
a democratic, title-scorning, liquor-denouncing
citizen of the U.S.A. amasses an immense
quantity of money, he nearly always makes
holiday with it in London, where there are
continued and glaring evidences of monarch-
ism and of the nation’s affection for alcohol.
Instead, however, of these things sickening
his soul and ruining his visit it is beyond
doubt that rich Americans —and Australians,
South Africans, Canadians and others —
heartily enjoy in London what they depre-
cate in their own countries. America now
holds over £900,000,000 in gold, or two-fifths
of the world’s supply, and the pound ster-
ling which used to be worth about 4.87 dol-
lars hovers round 4.35 dollars. Freetrade
will never rectify that position, but the lures
that are bound up in royalism and good
liquor, and their innumerable appurtenances,
such as social pageantry and first-class hotels
and restaurants, are beginning to do it
already.
* * * *
For generations Britain has been saying,
in effect, to the other English-speaking
nations: “Your country may be all right to
make money in, but this is the place to spend
money on the grand scale.” And while
scornfully denying the proposition, the rich
of all nationalities have proved its truth in
a most practical manner. Millionaire Rus-
sians, Austrians and Italians have gone year
after year to the English shires to hunt, and
some, like Count Kinsky, have set up costly
racing stables. Others have leased or bought
deer-forests and Scotch or Yorkshire grouse-
moors. Some of the biggest houses in Park-
lane and Piccadilly belong to South African
plutocrats, and the permanent Australian
colony in Britain is considerable, while there
are several rich families—the Wilsons, of
Victoria, for example—who have been ex-
patriated for so long that their association
with the land that supplies them with money
has been almost forgotten. Thousands of
Americans, of whom Lord and Lady Astok
are the most prominent, ai;e in the same cat-
egory. But never in history have foreigners
with money to burn poured into England in
such hordes as during the past 12 months.
The Wembley Exhibition is partly respon-
sible, of course; and the suggestion made by
that king of publicity-agents, the Prince of
Wales, that the show should be kept going
till next year is a sign of the nation’s appre-
ciation of its commercial potentialities. But,
chiefly, Britain allures because, despite all its
disadvantages—an abominable climate, natives
who are intensely class-conscious and hence
unsociable, an acute housing problem and
so on—it offers more allurements to those
able to pay extravagantly for their pleasures
than any other country. According to an
article written by Lord Birkenhead last
month in the San Francisco Examiner, “the
best Scotch whisky is only about $1.50 a
bottle higher in New York than in Montreal.
And this is not supplied through dangerous
channels, but by a most respected bootlegger
who, to my knowledge, belongs to at least one
good club in New York.” Unfortunately for
America’s traders in luxury goods, epicures
will not be satisfied permanently with whisky
alone, however sound and cheap and easily
and safely acquired. In London rich Ameri-
cans can walk into any good West End
restaurant and without a tremor order the
choicest wines of France’s Chateau or Cham-
pagne districts, vintage ports and ’65 bran-
dies, and be sure of getting any of them at
a lower figure than would be asked for fire-
water at home. If the visitors are very rich
indeed their wives and daughters will be in-
vited to royal functions; and if they are of
secondary financial importance they may, at
the worst, expect to figure at parties patron-
ised by minor royalties, thus acquiring pres-
tige which they will find gratifying, and even
sometimes commercially useful, when they re-
turn to the States to make more money. As
for the British, their Communist agitators
rail at “the king business” with virtuous
anger and contempt. H. G. Wells may be
seen performing the good old trick in his
latest novel. The Sovereign is an expensive
and useless figurehead ; the extravagant social
life of which he. is the centre amounts to an
affront to the poor; and the overseas visitors
whom it attracts are parasites who would
oblige a scandalised democracy by staying at
home. But no one is convinced. Hotelkeepers,
restaurateurs, milliners, tailors, bootmakers',
motor-car firms, gunsmiths and a thousand
others and their employees know that luxury
is business for England. The British have
capitalised high living. The U.lv. was only
one of the world’s playgrounds before the
Great War: with the Volstead amendment
operating to make America uncomfortable,
if not sober, and with most of Ehrope insol-
vent, Britain now holds a virtual monopoly
as a resort of touring millionaires, and as
time goes on the circumstance is going to do
much to balance the outgoings represented by
the duty of paying the creditor in Washing-
ton.

The difference between Australia’s position
and Britain’s is that most foreigners visit us
not to buy, but to sell. This country attracts
not the millionaires, but their bagmen. A
certain influx of bagmen is a necessary, even
a desirable, manifestation ; but no nation can
be said to have come into its own till it is
able to point to a generous stream of the other
class of visitor. Our cities can set against
the social attractions of London climates that
are as good as England’s is abominable, and
against the specialist sports of the old coun-
try—salmon-fishing, grouse and covert-shoot-
ing—surfing, better racing and yachting under
ideal conditions. Where we fail conspicu-
ously is in a disposition to spurn the ameni-
ties of life, in the sense that cosmopolitans
understand the phrase, as unworthy, if not
immoral. The law assists by making it as
difficult as possible for hotels to give of their
best (the recent N. S. Wales decision which,
to all intents and purposes, barred non-resi-
dents from entertaining friends to dinner in
hotel restaurants is a case in point), and
Prohibitionist, Next-Step and other bodies of
the sort continually urge legislatures on to
further repressions and inhibitions. We have
about the best foodstuffs in the world to-day,
and the worst cooks ; a large travelling popu-
lation, and country hotels that are marvels
of sordidness and discomfort. Much of the
coastal scenery from Wilson’s Promontory to
Cape York surpasses anything to be seen on the
Riviera or in Devonshire ; but wherever there
is a township Nature has been made hideous
by man, and wherever there is a road it is
such as to make sight-seeing a misery. We
have imported many unprofitable practices
from Britain, not the least of which is the
habit of importing cheap goods, but her im-
memorial habit of encouraging expensive
humans has been almost entirely neglected
so far. It is done by catering to the tastes
of the rich, and can be made almost as re-
munerative to those who practise it intelli-
gently as the IX. S. tariff lias proved to the
straw-hatted millionaires who are now help-
ing to enrich England.
AN AUSTRALIAN SMITHY.
As the Gwytlir cast oft her mooring lines and
swung over towards mid-stream to pass out
into the black Tasman Sea beyond the light
on Nobby’s, I stood on the port side of the
deck and watched the fireworks which the
Broken Hill Proprietary Co. nightly pro-
vides, as a sort of side-line, for the entertain-
ment of the people of Newcastle. All the
year round that red glare hangs low in the
sky over the wide and dismal flats three
miles lip the broad estuary of the Hunter,
sometimes intensified fitfully when they spill
out molten slag, or flaring into a Stromboli
when one of the big blast furnaces is tapped
at the end of every four hours. We turned
round Nobby’s, and headed down the coast
into a southerly gale; and all night long, be-
tween the Coal Island and the Sow and
Pigs, I see-sawed sleeplessly and sleepily in
a narrow bunk, and wondered over the mar-
vels and amazements of Port Waratah. For
I had been treading delicately and inter-
minably before the Lord who made that in-
genious devil Man, amidst strange and gigan-
tic and inspiring manifestations of his acti-
vities.
When the young boundary-rider Charlie
Rasp, on a September morning 41 years ago,
climbed the corrugated ridge in the Broken
Hill paddock of Mount Gipps station, his
“Prospectors’ Guide” in his pocket, stuck his
pick into the rusty outcrop, and smelted
some of it in his camp-fire, it) is certain that
he never dreamed of anything like the estab-
lishment at Port Waratah as an outcome of
his morning’s work. The whole story of
the B. H. Proprietary Co. is one of romantic
surprises, but there is none more surprising
than the genesis of the Steel Works from
the world’s richest silver-mine. Sturt, Rasp,
McCulloch —none of their imaginings could
have contained this! The stony ridge rising
out of the mulga, and the blast and open-
hearth furnaces, coke plant, bloom mills and
stockyard at Newcastle, with the score of
subsidiary industries to which already they
have given birth, are too greatly in contrast
for man’s grasp of the future.
A roomy steamer of robust physique was
lying at the wharf which stretches along the
low shore of the riverside, her holds being
unloaded by an electrically-operated ore
bridge—which is principally a cab contain-
ing hoisting machinery travelling on the
underside of a large steel bridge carried on
tall trestles. A clutching hand, a grab, lifts
the chocolate-red ore from the hold and de-
posits it on the ore-pile or directly into the
transfer car, six tons at a time, and it can
unload 240 tons in the hour. The transfer
car runs along the top of the blast furnace
bins, which contain ore, limestone, coke and
other raw materials. From the bins this mix-
ture is run through shoots into a small car
with a hopper carried in a weighing-machine,
so that the charge of each material
may be exactly determined. The fur-
nace is charged with ore, limestone and
coke in even layers, and is kept full. The
charge settles down slowly, getting hotter
as it sinks, until the iron is smelted out of
the ore and the whole mass is either melted
and drops into the crucible, or is volati-
lised, and carried out of the furnace as gas.
The waste gases are taken out of the top


of the furnace and, cleansed of ore and coke
dust, are used as fuel for the boilers of the
blowing engines and in the draught-heating
stoves.
The furnace is a sort of titanic bottle
which widens from the top to near the bot-
tom, so that the charge will slide down and
become thoroughly mixed in settling. Near
the bottom it tapers in again, so that the
charge does not all fall to the bottom, but
forms an arched roof, under which is the
crucible. The air necessary for the rapid
combustion of the coke is forced into the
furnace, by blowing engines, through the
draught-heating stoves, raising it to a tem-
perature of about KJOO degrees F. Two
holes in the w r alls of the crucible —one at
the bottom, through which the iron is drawn
off, and the other, higher up, for the removal
of excess of slag—are stopped with clay
plugs. When the furnace is tapped at four-
hourly intervals, the iron runs down a gutter
in the cast-house floor and into hot metal
ladles carried on railway lines at the side of
the furnace. By these hot metal is taken
to the open hearth furnace to be refined into
steel; some of it is cast into iron pigs
in moulds. The open hearth is a com-
plete model of the good old Hell of John
Calvin and other speculators iu Futures,
whither the children of the Right Thinking
should, in these sceptical days, be led in pil-
grimage to strengthen their belief in eternal
unpleasantnesses. It is a flat brick-lined pan
about 35ft. x 13ft., roofed and walled in.
The hearth is charged with scrap steel, rail-
ends, bloom-end and limestone (to make a
flux), some ore and pig-iron. At each end
are gas and air inlets. When the furnace is
charged gas and air are brought in from
one end, and a fierce flame plays on the
charge, the waste gases passing out through
the ports at the opposite end. From time to
time the gas is reversed, and comes in at the
other end, for by an arrangement of valves
the ports may be used for either inlet or
outlet. When the raw materials are melted
liquid iron from the blast furnace is poured
in from ladles through doors in the brick
wall, and in time the whole charge is re-
duced to the required chemical composition.
The furnace is tapped through a hole in
the centre of one side, and the charge ruus
out into a ladle, from which it is “teemed”
into moulds, and forms ingots, which are
ready for the rolling-mills. The ladle is
carried by a 100-ton crane over the row of
cast-iron moulds 6ft. deep by 20in. square,
standing on cast-iron plates, in pairs, on cast-
iron trucks. The record output for this
plant of seven furnaces —it is a world
record—is 10,420 tons for one week.
After you have warmed yourself at
these monstrous furnaces your guide
may take you through the mills, where
the fiery masses of incandescent steel
are punched and pommelled, squeezed
and stretched and juggled about from
huge machine to machine as if they
were playthings. The mills are housed in
a steel building 750 feet long by 140 feet
wide, and from the time the ingots enter them
until they pass out as rails, or whatever they
may be destined to become, they are handled
on electrically-driven roller conveyers. One or
two men high up in a “pulpit” dispose of the
red-hot tons of metal with an ease and dex-
terity that is superhuman.
The bloom mill, the rail mill, the merchant
min, the fishplate plant, the rod mill—there
is not room for detail of them here: each one of
them to the layman is a vast box of miracles
that make him feel small and mean, and the
side issues appertaining to them instruct him
in the sinfulnessi of waste. So far as that
goes, the Steel Works are sinless. On the
west of the works is the coke plant, most of
whose valuable by-products are captured and
utilised. The gas heats the coke ovens and
the furnaces. The tar is extracted from the
gas and sent to a refinery, and the ammonia
is extracted from the gas and the ammonia
liquor and turned into sulphate of ammonia,
and (so wide are the ripples from the stone
that Charles Rasp cast into the water) sul-
phate of ammonia means, among other things,
more plentiful vegetables and fruit. Re-
cently a plant has been. installed for
separating and refin in a- the light oils, which
give benzol, a valuable motor spirit, and
solvent naphtha. There is an engineers’
shop for repairs to the plant, and a steel
foundry; and throughout the works 26 miles
of standard-gauge railway. A score of
chemists, working night and day, closely
examine the chemical composition of raw
materials and finished products, while a
physical testing staff sees to it that they
comply with such standard or special qualifi-
cations as may be required.
But the main impression one carries away
from this great enterprise is one of human
efficiency. Everyone knows what to do. and
there is no loafing. There is nothing vacuous
here —all is competence, order, design. And
when you lunch in the hospitable mess —
they call it a canteen —at the head office, you
are surrounded by about as an efficient-
looking a lot of men as you are ever likely to
find yourself amongst.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
General Macready and the A.I.F.
A cable of last week represented General
Sir Nevil Macready as saying that “the
lack of a death penalty accounted for tin;
Australians’ ineffective discipline during
active service in France, as the result of
which hundreds were in a constant state of
desertion.” A.I.F. records show that the
number of desertions in France was negli-
gible ; the vast majority occurred in England,
and many of the men concerned were crimi-
nals who had enlisted without any intention
of going into the line. But that is beside the
only point that matters at this time of day.
General Macready typifies the impenitent
dug-out—the stubborn reactionary who, un-
less this country is careful, will foist on our
next expeditionary force, if not the death
penalty, at any rate an unreformed court-
martial system, and the rest of the wooden-
headed barbarities that belong to the days
when fighting-men had fewer rights than
slaves. This English possessor of the only
reliable recipe for improving the active-service
discipline of Australians has never been
eminent as a combatant himself—a charac-
teristic which is often found in martinets
When the World War began he had been a
commissioned officer for 33 years, and had
gone through two campaigns without earning
a single decoration for valor. From 1914 to
1918 he occupied the eminently safe positions
of A.G., 8.E.F., and A.G. to the Forces
respectively; after that he was Commissioner
of Metropolitan (London) Police. Hardly
the man to speak as an expert on battle dis-
cipline ; and yet it is invariably to this wordy
type that politicians turn for advice rather
than to the often inarticulate regimental
officer with experience of conditions in the
field! It might be thought that even the
rigid mind of a sexagenarian office-soldier
would suspect the value for fighting purposes
of men who can only be kept in the trenches
by the knowledge that they will be executed
if they leave them. But it must be remem-
bered that this type of general thinks of the
other ranks in terms of the phrase Welling-
ton applied to his men: “Dogs, the scum of
England!” If the dregs of society are caught
young by the recruiting officer; if they’ are
disciplined intensively for year after year,
till the habit of implicit obedience has become
instinctive; and if they are then sent into
action with the threat of a disgraceful death
should they fail —given all those conditions
they may yield satisfactory results, as the
British regulars did at Mons. But modern
armies are not composed of professional sol-
diers. Half-way through the late war it was
almost impossible to find a regular nearer the
front than a Divisional Headquarters. The
fighting was being done by hurriedly-trained
conscripts and—as in the A.I.F. —by volun-
teers. Under such conditions the coward cannot
be made to stand, even by the threat of death
in the event of his bolting. Seventy-five per
cent, of the men in the Fifth Army were no
doubt brave enough : they were not routed by
the shells of the Germans; they were de-
moralised by comrades who had even less
stomach for a certain fight than for a possible
firing party. The Australians were never
routed. On the contrary. The military, cor-
respondent of the current American Mercury
mentions that in 1918 “the Germans circu-
lated a document giving their notion of how
the various divisions of the British Army
ranked in striking power.” The 51st Highland
division was placed first, and the five Aus-
tralian divisions next. The existence of the
death penalty would certainly not have helped
the Australians to better that record, and it
might well have robbed them of it.

“Good Roads v. Bad Railways.”
“Slogans” are, and have been for some time,
a fashion in these parts, and tend to become
a nuisance. The two latest are to the effect
that the tramways, which aren't paid for yet,
should be removed from Sydney’s streets
because there are too many people, and that
“good roads” should be substituted for branch
railways in the country because there are not
enough people. Things may come to that;
but if they do the disease won't be cured —it
will be merely a few symptoms that will have
been got rid of. The too-many folk in one
place are the natural cause of the not-enough
folk in the others ; for when there are 650
inhabitants per square mile in the County of
Cumberland, there are only about four per
mile left for the huge balance of the area.
The case of London, which doesn’t permit
tramcars in the city area, is quoted as a pre-
cedent and a justification; but the rest of
England outside London having some 600
human beings to the square mile, there is
little chance for building new cities to relieve
the great Bullopolis. In N. S. Wales outside
Sydney, with its four persons per mile and its
best harbors kept empty and their shores un-
populated through lack of railway connec-
tion with their inlands, there is room in
abundance, and the metropolis isn’t so much
a city as a crime, and a stupid one at that.
The reason always assigned for the refusal to
make other ports accessible is that the exist-
ing adjacent population is insufficient to
make a line pay, and for want of the line
the population remains permanently insuffi-
cient. Fresh railways to “open up a new
area of wheat country” are as common as
sins, and muddy, hopeless little river “ports”
on the Murray and Murrumbidgee and the
Darling and the Bar won and the Lachlan are
“linked up” unprofitably by the dozen ; but
when the question concerns a new city and
a new seaport, insuperable difficulties arise
like Hies in all directions. Hence the latest
“slogan” of “Good Roads v. Bad Railways,”
and the proposal that one of the few highly-
payable assets in the Ma State’s repertoire
should be scrapped as a sacrifice to the God-
dess of Premeditated Bloat. N. S. Wales,
with 2[ million people on an area vastly
larger than France or Japan, has raised one
city which beats Budapest, Warsaw, Cairo,
Madrid, Moscow, Brussels, Prague, Copen-
hagen, Rome, The Hague, Munich, Leipsic,
Dresden, Lisbon and probably Constanti-
nople, to say nothing of a terrace of minor-
capitals. It knows well that it suffers from
a disease, and it is always talking settlement;
in fact, there is not a thing that N. S.
Wales wouldn’t do to bring about a greater-
diffusion of population—except the thing that
has brought it about in every other country
where it lias been tried.

Make-believe Finance.
Discussing the latest Commonwealth “sur-
plus,” a Bulletin writer remarked that
Australian Government finance was largely
a game of make-believe. He pointed out
that the “surplus” was brought about by
a boom in Customs revenue, which exceeded
the Treasurer’s estimate by six millions, and
that the boom in Customs revenue was partly
the result of enthusiastic Government bor-
rowing. In other words, the six State Gov-
ernments floated as many loans as London
(and New York) would stand, and
out of the proceeds bought foreign
goods on which the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment levied import duties. The pro-
duce of the duties on these consignments
figured in the Customs revenue, and hence in
Page’s surplus, which to that extent was a
sham. This may be carried still further.
The State Governments share in the
“revenue” so obtained and are enabled there-
by to manufacture surpluses of their own,
or to reduce their deficits in proportion. For
example, the S.A. Government spends
£1,250,000 in the purchase and shipment of
foreign railway material, on which the
Commonwealth" Government imposes duties
amounting to, say. £300,000. Both these
sums are provided for in the London loan.
Out of its Customs receipts the Common-
wealth allows the States 255. per head of
population ; thus portion of the £300,000 paid
in duty finds its way to the State which bor-
rowed it for that purpose, and is there called
revenue. Of course, there is no actual re-
mittance of money from London to Mel-
bourne, or from Melbourne to Adelaide, but
the transformation of debts on which interest
has to be paid into material for “surpluses,”
Federal and State, is accomplished just the
same. There is a fine elasticity in the term
“revenue ” as employed in Australia. Accord-
ing to the usage of facile Treasurers, unpaid
interest on abandoned soldier-settlements is
revenue; so is the cost of transporting
politicians and other deadheads over the
Government railways ; so is income-tax paid
by a self-sufficient Government undertaking
for officials in its employ. That was done
on an extensive scale by the Commonwealth
Bank. It is one of the interesting facts that
have leaked out recently about this too-
mysterious institution; another is that the
bank has had the use, free of interest, of
Government deposits soaring to as much
as £40,000,000, part of which was doubtless
borrowed in London at 6 p.c. or thereabouts.
On this subject pertinent remarks were made
in the House of Reps, by Wiiitsitt, the
member for Darwin (Tas.), who has been
a banker himself :
The water has boiled out of the pot now. Accord-
ing to the Treasurer, the bank has received from
the Commonwealth during the last nine years an
average of £12,000,000 per annum free of interest.
At 5 per cent, that money should have earned
£5,400,000, but the profits of the bank during the
whole period have been only £4,500,000, notwith-
standing the great volume of business which was
given to it in connexion with the war. If the
Commonwealth Government had handed to me
£12,000,000 per annum for nine years, I should
have undertaken to return a bigger profit than the
bank has yielded.
Truly, this is a land of make-believe finance!
The Adversities of John Bull’s Country.
The latest batch of British statistics are
curiously irregular, some being to the end of
1923 and some to 1922, while an odd table
here and there ends with 1921—which suggests
untidiness, dispiritedness and a new habit of
procrastination. But whether older or newer
the same vein of melancholy runs through
almost all. The recovery of the ground lost
during the war seems to be indefinitely post-
poned. For example:—
Between 1913 and 1922 the quantity of iron ore
dug out of the ground fell from 15,997,000 tons to
6,868,000 tons. Yet the country keeps on importing
ore on a large 5ca1e—3,473,000 tons in 1922. In
that year the value of imported iron ore was
£1,890,000 more than the value of the local product.
The number of blast furnaces in use fell from
338 (1913) to 132 (1922). In 1921 the number
was as low as 95. In round figures, the quantity
of ore smelted dropped from 2 of million tons to
10}; pig-iron made from 10} millions to under
five millions; coal and coke used from 21} million
tons to 6f.
The quantity of cotton, wool and flax required to
keep John Bull’s mills going declined from 3102
tons in 1913 to 2079 tons in 1922.
The cost of pauperism for the whole of Britain
is given only up to March 1922, the last four years
shaping as follows:
1918- . £20,165,057 | 1920-21.. £35,625,527
1919- 25,669,992 1 1921-22.. 46,845,586
These figures, of course, are quite apart from old
age pensions, war pensions, unemployment insurance
and some sundries.
In 1913 imports exceeded exports by 134 millions,
but in those days Britain was purely a creditor
country, and with interest rolling in from all parts
it had the means to pay with. In 1923 imports
exceeded exports by 212 millions, and the country
is now heavily in the debtor class as far as the
United States are concerned, while a lot of its
foreign investments have gone bad and ceased to
yield anything.
It was mentioned with justifiable pride in 1920
that Britain had begun to reduce its National Debt,
in which respect it and the United States were alone,
or so it was generally understood, among the nations.
Now Britain’s debt is piling up again fast. The
debt reached a temporary minimum in 1921; but,
despite the payments made in reduction of the U.S.
liability, it grew by £190,000,000 between then and
March, 1923.
Scotland, which depends to a very great extent on
the iron and coal business, is set down by the official
estimate for 1923 as a country which has definitely
commenced to decrease in population. Many of the
agricultural counties have been long in a state of
decay, but now it is the “ancient kingdom” in general
that is on the down grade. Yet it is no densely -
peopled place as European ideas go, ranking rather
behind Portugal,
The year 3920 was the year when the en-
larged and improved unemployment insurance
scheme and sundry other expensive and pater-
nal Acts came into effect, and it was also the
time of the great coal strike. Promptly after it
came the biggest industrial landslide, but
the movement, in some important lines, had
commenced earlier. In some cases there was
a slight revival after 1921, while in others
the downward progress continues to this day.
And 1920, which is some distance back, can’t
account in more than a small measure for
the all-round failure to recover the standard
of 1913. Especially it is insufficient to
account for the birth and marriage rate
figures, which for England, Wales and Scor-
land have moved in this fashion: —
Marriages. Births.
1920 . . . . 426,496 1,094,532
1921 . . 360,120 972,010
1922 . . . . 333,918 895,209
1923 . . .. 327,286 870,287
Figures like these almost suggest a com-
munity which has lost heart and belief in
the future, even though it may have found
the complete gospel of Freetrade by way of
compensation.

Dried Fruit and Motor-cars.
The negotiation about trade reciprocity with
Canada still drags along, the latest pub-
lished proposition being that Australia
should give the Kanuek specially low rates
on “news printing paper, motor-cars, tinned
fish, and one or two other items,” though it
will probably require some very spry
negotiation to prevent the list spreading out to
one or two dozen “other items.” In return
it is suggested that Canada should reduce
its duties on dried fruits. Reciprocity
treaties are a valuable idea, for such articles
as a country requires and can’t produce
must be imported; but it is a dolt of a
country if it gives away its custom while
that article is saleable. But Canada learned
commercial ways in the school of our mutual
uncle, Samuel of the Stars and Stripes, and
learned them so much better than we did
that during the two years 1921-22 and
1922-23 it sold Australia goods to the value
of £7,569,712, and bought from us to the
meagre, not to say mangy, extent of £528,469.
In opening conversations with a customer like
that, the preliminary idea should be to ask
for concessions on 10 articles and offer a re-
duction of duty on one, in the hope that
business may be put on a more equitable
footing. Supposing the Kanuek could be
beguiled into giving a solid advantage to Aus-
tralian wine, brandy, fruit, sugar, molasses,
coal and woollen goods (this country could
make woollens for export if it tried hard
enough), and accepted a preference on news
printing paper and tinned fish in return, it
should be really possible to find a basis to
go on. Failing something of the sort, two
alternatives present themselves. One is to
stop all preferences, but make advances to
some other country, which would not be the
United States, it being more convinced than
Canada that trade consists in selling every-
thing and buying nothing, and would not be
the United Kingdom, which has already de-
clared that it regards its children, its allies
and its enemies as on the same footing. The
other idea is to stop all preferences and make
advancesi to no one, but intimate that offers
will be considered. In either case a body of
experts should be appointed to see if ways can
be devised to greatly reduce importations
from the Two Bad Customers across the
Pacific.

An Old Idol Totters.
There are Freetraders still in Australia, and
wherever a few of them have gathered to-
gether of late years the conversation has in-
clined towards shipping. They are not nearly
so cocksure as of old about most of the so-
called fallacies of Protection, their change
of front bearing an interesting resemblance
to the volte face accomplished by the oppo-
nents of compulsory service here and in Bri-
tain after 1914. As regards the beneficent
effects of Cobdenism on the shipping indus-
try, however, they are solid. In a recent
pronouncement on the subject in Sydney it
was declared that no Protectionist country
could hope to compete with Britain at sea,
since “the mercantile marine [of the U.K.].
had the inestimable advantage of free im-
ports, thus enabling the shipping yards to
turn out ships as good as, if not better than,
their trade rivals at a less price.” The same
point of view has often been expressed in
England. During the last elections A. G.
Gardiner, for years editor of the London
Daily News, wrote in the Nation : •
At a meeting which I addressed at Eastbourne, a
fine, white-bearded old man. a mariner who had gone
to sea as a boy in the middle of the last century, got
up in the midst of the audience and told how he
had seen the mercantile marine of the United States
disappear under the influence of Protection, and the
mercantile marine of this country develop into un-
challenged supremacy under the influence of Free-
trade. The effect of this bit of living experience
was extraordinary.
But what are the facts about this “unchal-
lenged supremacy”? Last week “Lloyd's
Register of Shipping” published the follow-
ing :
In 1914 the total tonnage of Great Britain and
Ireland aggregated 18,877,000 tons gross register,
compared with 18,917,000 tons at present. Shipping
tonnage of the British Dominions has increased to
2,213,000 tons at June 30, compared with 1,407,000
tons in 1914. Among foreign countries the United
States shows a tremendous increase to 11,825,000
tons at June 30, compared with 1,837,000 in 1914 ;
and France has 3,193,000 tons, compared with
1,918,000 tons in 1914. Holland’s shipping stands at
2,533,000 tons, compared with 1,471,000 tons 10
years ago, and Italy has 2,676,000 tons, compared
with 1,428,000 in i 914. Japan’s shipping tonnage
has increased from 1,642,000 tons gross register in
1914 to 3,655,000 tons at June 30.
Germany, which had three times France's
tonnage in 1914, is 300,000 tons behind her
to-day, chiefly owing to seizures under the
Versailles agreement, but is fast picking up;
and America’s huge advance is also attri-
butable in great part to the war. The only
nation which has remained practically sta-
tionary is Freetrade Britain: the countries
with Protective tariffs, putting aside the
cases mentioned above, have increased their
mercantile marine in proportion as they have
raised their duty schedules. Apart from the
Freetrade handicap, there is every reason
why the British mercantile marine should,
boom. The U.K. is the depot for most of
the trade between Western and North-West-
ern Europe and the Americas and the Brit-
ish Dominions. In the passenger-carrying
trade Germany and the U.S.A. were Britain's
only serious rivals before the war, and the
former is still struggling against war-created
prejudices, while the attempt to enforce
liquor-prohibition at sea has affected
America's prospects. What appears to be
happening to British shipping is exactly what
happened to British trade when first the pro-
gressive Continental countries, and next the
U.S.A., disregarded the warnings of Gobden
and went in for economic defence. England's
mercantile marine is not going back, but
other fleets are advancing more rapidly: ir
is still an impressive money-maker, but not
nearly such an impressive one relatively as
it used to be. Is it not reasonable to deduce
that Freetrade is to blame, as it is unques-
tionably to blame for the nation’s tragic army
of men and women who are subsisting on
doles because so much of the nation’s work
is being done for it in Protectionist countries?

“Popular” Politics.
Students of Hansard know that our poli-
tics are seldom inspiring; but it is surpris-
ing none the less to find a Church dignitary,
the Bishop of Gippsland, who has the courage
to say that they are conducted on the lines
of a hardware store, and that the last Im-
perial Conference was like a directors’ meet-
ing considering only questions of paying pro-
positions and possible bargains. “The really
permanent bonds of Empire,” says the
Bishop, “or of family or community, are
ideas. The real forces that make for nation-
hood are founded on the common culture of
literature, art and religion.” No doubt the
Bishop’s idealism will be regarded as rank
heresy. But popular low-brow politics tend
not only to divide the Empire, but to split
up Australia. The Commonwealth is no
longer regarded as an organism, but as a
house divided against itself. The country
declares war on the towns, agriculture look-
ing on national manufactures as its natural
enemy. Queensland fights Tasmania —Sugar
v. Jam. Even little Victoria is split into
warring camps,- one electorate trying to beat

another over the question of a new railway
line or a bush road or a roll or two of wire-
netting:. No big issues are discussed, only
sectional and material interests. It appears
that the one w r ay to get votes is to make the
narrowest and most selfish appeal to the
supposed interests of the candidate’s own
electorate. There must be something hor-
ribly wrong with our present vote-catching
so-called representative system which repre-
sents mainly, as Oscar Wilde once said, “the
organised ignorance of the community.”
Popular politics are on the same level as
popular literature. If English literature
were represented, like politics, by best-sellers,
there would be no Hardy or Yeats —only such
figures as Ethel M. Dell and the successors
of Charles Garvice. Under our out-of-date
Party system this is almost the result we
achieve in politics. What chance has any
expert who knows his subject, and considers
the interests of the State as a whole and in
relationship to the Commonwealth, against
the demagogue who regards the boundary
of his electorate as the land’s end, and knows
the ropes, inquires after the last pig or baby,
appeals to the “sovereign will” of the people,
laughs and weeps at will, and calls upon his
God to witness that the charge against him
of corruption was never proved? Who
would tolerate such a person of bluff and
bounce in the world of science, art or reli-
gion ? But the report of debates in the
House and the speeches of candidates on the
hustings show that this is the very type of
politician that has the best chance of elec-
tion. Surely it might be possible to devise
a more reasonable and less haphazard method
of representation whereby the really compe-
tent men, the finest experts and true leaders
of the people, would direct the affairs of
the country! “Popular” politics, which are
not popular at all, but a wild caricature of
democracy, would lead any country into
chaos. A Frenchman, with characteristic
Latin logic, proposed that the candidate who
obtained the least votes should be elected.
This method is not flawless; but it seems
an improvement on the cheap and nasty sys-
tem at present in vogue of returning the man
who can bluff the biggest number of fools
or buy the biggest number of rogues in a
given area to vote for him.

Mr. Facing-both-ways Anstey, M.P.
It is possible to understand and even sympa-
thise with a sincere pacifist on the principle
by which Anatole France explained the
mental processes of another kind of bigot:
he allocates one side of his brain to Reason
and the other to Faith. But what is to be
said for our neo-pacifists of the type of
Acting-Labor-leader Frank Anstey, who are
capable in one and the same speech of deny-
ing that there is any justification for arma-
ments and of affirming that in certain cir-
cumstances money may advantageously be
spent on “extending the aerial fleet” and on
munitions factories? This JANUS-like point
of view, which was disclosed by Mr. Charl-
ton’s understudy in his speech on the De-
fence Equipment Bill last week, is as dis-
concerting to plain men as the same speaker’s
unexpected tributes to the virtues of national
patriotism were at a recent Special Service
Squadron banquet. Modern Labor, as ex-
pressed by Anstey, bases its so-called
Defence policy on three main claims: —
(1) That Australia will never be invaded, there
being no danger from the U.S. or from “destitute
and impoverished Europe,” and Japan having “honored
her agreement when Britain had her back to the
wall.”
(2) That Australia cannot be effectively invaded
owing to the sea distances that separate the Eastern
coasts from possible enemies.
(3) That if conclusions (1) and (2) prove wrong,
a local land force is capable of dealing w’ith the
situation.
Unfortunately the theories on which all these
assumptions rest have been proved fallacious
during the past 10 years. Germany showed
in 1914 that a nation which is friendly and
loyal to-day, and was friendly and loyal
yesterday, may be neither to-morrow. The
Germans had far less cause to be annoyed
with England, which for generations had
been welcoming them in every capacity, from
that of royal consorts downwards, than the
• Japanese have to dislike Australia, which
affronts them with a stringently-adminis-
tered Immigration Exclusion Act. There was
a widely-held theory before 1914 that no
troops could be transported by sea while an
enemy fleet was in being. The spectacle was
eventually witnessed of hundreds of thou-
sands of Americans being rushed to France,
through seas teeming with submarines, and
not a man lost. As for land defence, it
is not too much to say that Germany lost the
war through being compelled virtually to rely
on it. Germany’s lack of a fleet capable of
patrolling the seas at will not only pre-
vented her from adequately feeding her people
and guns, but finally caused her armies to
be outnumbered. The position of the Com-
monwealth in the event of Asiatic aggression
would be incomparably worse. According to
General Howse we are incapable of putting
one physically fit army corps into the field,
and according to General Chauvel and
other experts we are unarmed. If invaded,
then, even by such a force as Australia sent
to the Dardanelles, we would not be in a
position to put up an effective fight, and with
every fresh enemy troopship that arrived the
future would grow’ blacker. The obvious
remedy for an obvious danger is co-opera-
tion at sea with the British Fleet—a defence
policy that is as useful diplomatically in the
present as it is likely to be for purposes of
warfare in the future. Labor men of the
mental calibre of Fbank Anstey must know
it in their hearts. It is the necessity of
placating the Internationalist section of the
party, wdiile not wholly alienating the sec-
tion wdiich supplied the A.I.F. with so many
of its best men, that compels them to face
both wmys on the Defence issue—a tragic
example of how party tactics may endanger
a nation’s life.

“Nationalism” and a New Birth.
Bruce and Peacock are Teported to have
been discussing plans for instilling new life
into their party, which has suffered so many
reverses at State elections. The one hope for
the Nationalists lies in a new birth of Aus-
tralianism, and in the matter of the two
10,000-ton cruisers they have been provided
with a golden opportunity of bringing it

“On the day they gave pages to Charlton’s win of a swimming race, the papers reported in
three lines that two young Australian surgeons had been invited to deliver the oration in surgery

about. By opposing the restoration of the
Australian Navy, the Federal Labor party
has ludicrously misrepresented the spirit of
the Australian democracy. That spirit was
significantly expressed when the Common-
wealth's one battle-cruiser was destroyed in
accordance with the Washington Treaty, in
which treaty, by the way, there is nothing
to prevent Japan from attacking the Philip-
pines or a hostile naval Power from strik-
ing at, the Northern Territory or Westralia.
Absolutely the strongest protest against the
sinking of the warship which protected the
Australian coasts from the guns of Spee’s
squadron came from Newcastle, which has
always returned a Labor member. The fact
is that the average Australian worker is
proud of the R.A.N., and is not prepared to
leave his country and its White Australia
policy naked to their enemies. If he has
to choose between a party which stands for
adequate national defence and a Labor party
dominated by the sort of politicians who
used to be known in America as Copper-
heads, the latter will get a shock. The abys-
mal folly of the Labor Opposition has given
Bruce a chance of fighting it on tile issue
of Australianism versus Pacifism. Let him
come out boldly with a declaration that
the R.A.N. must be preserved, that one of
the cruisers and an ample supply of guns
and munitions will be constructed by Aus-
tralian workmen, placed upon their honor to
give the country a fair deal, and that every
worth-while Australian industry will be suffi-
ciently protected, by the tariff route and
otherwise. In that way and no other will
his party achieve a new birth.

“Anophele” (Darwin) : The articles on
Tropical Diseases (B. 29/5/’24 and 5/G/’24)
recall the great battle waged against malaria
up here in the Territory after the return of
men from the war. A number went back
to their old jobs and districts; other re-
turned soldiers, who had acquired the roving
spirit, headed this way, many from Groper-
land. Also the Commonwealth Government
sent a prospecting party into the Territory,
with instructions to wander at their own free
will. Many of these men had been in Egypt
and Palestine, and, if not actual carriers,
were likely subjects for contacts. Little
wonder that a wave of malaria swept
through the Territory, and every police dis-
trict reported dozens of cases. Seventeen
deaths wore reported in a shade less than
three months. All hospitals were full, and
each train brought its quota to Darwin to
swell the crowd of bush battlers already re-
ceiving attention there. Incidentally, the
Inland Mission’s hospitals did excellent work,
and many a man working away on the sta-
tions and mining fields to-day owes his life
to the ministrations of the noble women in
charge of these nursing homes scattered
throughout the Never-Never. Also, the medi-
cal officer at Darwin took prompt action,
and organised an effective system for dealing
with all cases that could be located. Leaflets
and dodgers were sent throughout the coun-
try, and definite and emphatic instructions
was issued to all police officers and other
responsible persons. Ample supplies of
quinine and medical comforts were for-
warded to all parts ; carriers were located and
treated —sometimes under compulsion—a
couple of the most persistent cases were sent
south for further treatment. Camps were
cleaned un and all known waterholes and
camping-grounds had notices posted up, with
instructions as to the method of treatment.
The result is that the Territory is freer of
malaria than it had been for the last 20
years.
The Education Commission now sitting in
the Speck under the chairmanship of Peter
Board, to find out whether the State is
getting value for its money in its High
Schools, has been providing the press with
a sensation. A lady member of the Com-
mission declared that Education Director
(?. V. Brooks, when giving evidence, made
an admission that ought to put him out of
his job, viz., that he had refrained from clos-
ing an obviously unrequired State High School
at Burnie because, or partly because, the
head teacher was the State Premier’s brother-
in-law. Brooks promptly denied that he had
intended to convey any such outrageous im-
pression, but the lady commissioner insisted
that there could be no mistake, as she had
“taken a note” of his exact words. An
examination of the official shorthand report
was naturally demanded by both sides, but it
disclosed the disconcerting fact that the re-
porter (another lady) had failed to take
down Mr. Brooks verbatim, regarding this
portion of his remarks as confidential or con-
versational or something. The din of the
dispute reached Premier Lyons, who assured
the Commission that, if the Director bad said
anything so highly improper as was alleged,
he (the Premier) had had no hand in, or
cognisance of, it: Lyons further suggested
that the insinuation conveyed was absurd,
inasmuch as the closing of the school could
not affect the status or the salary of the
teacher in question—he would merely go to
another school at the same or a higher salary.
Lyons finally demanded that the Commission
should clear up the matter at once, and
Director Brooks said ditto. The result was
that, in a short half-hour, nearly everybody
seemed satisfied that a verdict of misunder-
standing would meet the case. But there
may be a sort of minority report by the
lady commissioner, enlarging upon certain
public servants’ tendency to indiscretions of
speech.

From a former union secretary:—
Having- had something- to do with assisting boys to
enter skilled trades, I agree with the Apprenticeship
office of the Queensland Department of Labor (15.
3/7/’24) that nearly all youngsters desire to become
motor mechanics, electricians or engineers. However,
it is one thing to express a preference for a trade
and another to show an aptitude for it. Many of
the boys who came under my notice were so palpably
unsuited to the fashionable calling they wished io
enter, or said they did, that I summed them up as
having been self-deceived or over-persuaded by some
doting parent. James Nangle, Superintendent of
Technical Education in N. S. Wales, is a strong
advocate of the principle that every normal lad
has some bent which he should be allowed to
follow in the selection of his life’s work, but this
bent, he insists, is to be scientifically sought for
and not hastily determined upon the youngster’s say-
so. In one case Nangle interviewed a boy who said
that he wanted to be an engineer. Questioned as to
his knowledge of engines, the lad admitted that he
had failed to observe even the number of wheels
on an ordinary locomotive. Further interrogation
revealed that, although he had never been sufficiently
interested in engines to examine one at close quarters,
he had a passion for building- toy yachts and sailing
them when built. That boy was apprenticed to boat-
building, and has made good. Some day, when we
get a new breed of politicians, every schoolboy will
be taught a trade. When that day arrives it will
be necessary to depend on something more than the
fancied desires of the boys or the whims of the
parents (frequently altogether illogical) in arriving
at a decision as to what calling the youngster is
fit for; and the something more will probably be
on the lines which Nangle adopts when he gets the
chance —close observation of the boy’s bent as revealed
in his plfi}' and his schoolwork.
-— *——- —♦
The present British Ministry talks a good
deal of its “loyalty to the Empire” to
compensate for its lack of practical helpful-
ness, and Colonial Secretary Thomas made
some specially lofty deliverances lately to a
Commerce Congress dinner-party. He de-
clared that Imperial concerns shouldn’t be
made party affairs ; and people who noticed
that a mere change of the party in office
led to the abandonment of Dominion prefer-
ence and the scrapping of the Singapore
naval base cordially agreed. He added that
“the talk of losing the Empire was humbug.”
Possibly it is. Possibly, on the other hand,
the Empire is lost already, only the fact has
escaped the secretarial eye. With no com-
mon legislature, army, navy, tariff, code of
laws, color, coinage or religion, and with
all the Dominions that count, the Irish Free
State included, allowed the option of remain-
ing neutral (at their own risk) when the
Empire is attacked, there isn’t sp very much
of a “bond” left. If in these hungry times
of war indebtedness, struggling Dominions
try to eke out a crust by making reciprocal
tariff bargains with foreign Statep, their own
country having refused, with something like
scorn, to do business, there will be a bond,
but of the wrong sort. In fact, there will
be a divided allegiance. It would be curious
if Britain found, by some process of sudden
revelation, that it had lost the Empire with-
out knowing it, and the Dominions discovered
that they had left the Empire without being
aware of it, and that both events were years
old when they oozed out.

POLITICAL
POINTS
From the Victorian Gallery:—
By 43 votes to 16 the Assembly threw out the
Peacock Government, after its short and troubled
reign of T 9 days. Prendergast’s attack was delivered
in a two-minute speech. Then came a stab from
Allan, the Cocky leader, a blow from Snowball,
leader of the Liberal five, and a few kind words from
McLachlan, the Independent, and Prohibitionist Green-
wood. Peacock took it all smilingly. He and
Gordon were the only two of the team for whom
those who ejected him felt sorry; Argyle, Eggleston,
Toutclier, Beardmore and Groves can hardly complain
at being beaten at a game they themselves have
played.
Though Prendergast, the new Vic. Pre-
mier, could be sacked at any moment, there
is a pretty general feeling that he will be
given a fair run. He might last the year
out by introducing n on-controversial legisla-
tion ; even a redistribution of seats scheme
granting the metropolis a bigger say in the
IJouse than Peacock offered it wouldn t
necessarily endanger his job. The Labor
Premier, however, will have no easy task
with the Red Raggers egging him on. He
will almost certainly be asked to reinstate
the sacked police strikers; and if he sur-
renders to that demand it will mean sudden
death.
Lazzarini, who mouths the pacifist social-
ism of Italy, distinguished himself in the
latest Defence debate in the Reps, by declar-
ing that the two proposed cruisers would
be so useless for the protection of trade
routes, which is what they are intended tor,
that “the money might as well bn thrown
into the sea.” Yet a modest 5400-ton
cruiser saved the Westralian coast from a
commerce-raider which had done enormous
damage in the Indian Ocean. And the mere
presence of an 18,800-tonner off the east
coast scared a formidable enemy squadron
to the other side of the Pacific. Perhaps
a politician who talks of wiping out the
national debt by issuing an equivalent
amount of paper money can’t be expected
to know these things, even though lie spent
the war years in Australia. Still, any
schoolboy could give him the necessary in-
struction.
Cocky-leader Allan found difficulty in con-
cealing his chagrin at being ignored by Gov-
ernor Stradbroke when the Vic. Premier-
ship became vacant. Without tendering
advice or being asked for it, Peacock handed
in his resignation; but he shrewdly sup-
plied his Ex. with a proof of the Hansard
report of the previous evening’s Assembly
debate. That showed so clearly that the
Labor 27 had been supported by 12 Coekies
and five Liberals that the Earl had no need
for a chat with Farmer John from Rodney
before handing a commission, uncondition-
ally, to Prendergast. Now Allan may have
a try for the Opposition leadership, with
the view of launching an attack on Labor
before it can properly warm the Treasury
bench.
After appointing a committee to review
the cases of the four N.S.W. Labor politi-
cians Warned for the ballot-boxes with sliding
panels, the Federal A.L.P. has refused to
deal with its report. That document, which
is believed to have pronounced the accused
as guiltless as Galahad, has been “referred
to the October conference,” and there is no
certainty that the October conference won’t
refer it back to the Federal executive or send
it on to Washington. Meantime the four,
being “automatically out of the movement,”
are unable to contest selection-ballots on
which they had set their hearts. The A.W.U.,
at whose instance the committee was ap-
pointed, is now furious with the N.S.YV.
executive for expelling the quartette, and bit-
terly contemptuous of the Federal execu-
tive for not removing the expulsions, and in
the tumult of feelings it may do something
desperate. Start another Labor party, per-
haps.
Perhaps Australia will do something some
day for the spread of the higher education,
but this decentralisation idea, like all decen-
tralisation movements, has the pace of a
tombstone. The Commonwealth has six uni-
versities, one at each State capital, for no-
thing much save rabbits is expected to
happen save at a State capital. The Union
of South Africa has one-sixth of Australia’s
area, and not one-third of its white popula-
tion. In its four States it runs nine univer-
sities, none so big as Sydney, Melbourne or
Adelaide, but handy. Three of them are in
towns smaller than Lithgow, the idea possibly
being that a peaceful hamlet is a good place
for study. The young Afrikander can hardly
look out of his front door without seeing the
higher education lying in wait for him.
Jens August Jensen, one-time Federal
Minister, now one of the six State members
for Bass, the other day appeared before the
THE ANSTEYEAN THEORY.
“Deputy Federal Labor-leader Anstey denounced the proposal to acquire two new cruisers for naval
defence.”
Tas. Labor Conference to plead for
readmission to the Labor party. Jensen
made a dramatic appeal to the con-
ference, and some of the half-dozen
women delegates were moved to tears.
Mere male delegates, however, asked the sup-
pliant to explain, among other things, just
why he fell out of the Hughes-Watt Cabinet,
and to enlighten the conference on certain
obscure points in connection with Shaw
Wireless. Apparently the replies could
hardly have been considered satisfactory, for
conference resolved that it was “not in the
best interests of Labor to readmit Mr. Jen-
sen to membership in the A.L.P.”
Gabb, Labor M.11.R. for Angas (S.A.),
whose practice of demanding a quorum
breaks up so many bridge and snooker
parties, has given additional offence to “ad-
vanced” Labor members by supporting the
Government proposal for adding two 30,000-
ton cruisers to the R.A.N., instead of letting
it perish. II is speech was so Australian in
sentiment that he was angrily carpeted in
Caucus, and at latest it wasn’t certain
whether the offender would be ordered to
stand on his head for ten minutes With a
white flag tied to his feet or apologise to
the Soviet Republic.
Just before the X. S. Wales Premier went
into hospital for surgical treatment (unreli-
able report has it that he went to have his
procrastination cut out) a long list of
small bills was announced. Some of them
were so small as to be hardly visible. The
measure for the reform of the Upper House
wasn’t among them, but rumor talks to the
effect that the amended institution will con-
sist of a limited number of nominees instead
of an unlimited number, and that they will
be in for a term instead of till the under-
taker calls for them with a long box. There
will be the “necessary provision” to prevent
a House which can be neither dissolved nor
swamped “resisting the will of the people.”
An Upper House, like a Lower one, should
represent the will of the people be the
people, and then it couldn't "resist.” That
is why it should be elected by the adult popu-
lation voting as one constituency, so that
both Houses would reflect popular senti-
ment, but from different angles.
The Speck’s Labor Conference, sitting at
Hobart, voted in favor of abolishing selection
ballots. A doubt arose, however, as to
whether the rule requiring a two-thirds
majority before the constitution can be
amended had been fully complied with, and
the precise meaning of the old rule is to' be
determined by the executive. The voting on
the proposed amendment is alleged to have
been 29 to 15.
“Rounds”: Peacock was never afraid to
face the reporters, whether he had a cheerful
or doleful tale or no tale at all. To the
last he was urbane and courteous, even when
he had to announce that the funeral of his
Ministry had been arranged. In striking
contrast, Prendergast, when sent for by Gov-
ernor Stradbroke to form a Ministry, sneaked
in bv the cellar door of the old Treasury and
went out the same way, not because ot an
excess of modesty, but to be able to boast
that he had dodged the press fellows. The
fact was that the men of ink, knowing that
he must come along to them soon, were not
bothering about him —they were concentrat-
ing ou the Charities Board report.
The sale of the fixings of 44 poultry-
farms on to which soldier settlers had been
pushed at Bankstown (N.S.W.) marks
another stage of the failure of Repat. Men
who started with a bare knowledge that
hens laid eggs were expensively placed on
the blocks and fettered with red-tape m such
a fashion that even those who had aptitude
for poultry-farming had little, if any, chance
of making good. Much public money, and,
what is a greater loss, five or six years ot
the ex-soldiers’ lives, and all their hope and
enthusiasm, have been wasted on the mis-
directed experiment.
N. S. Wales Minister of Public Instruction
was asked by Rutledge, M.L.A., last week —■
Will he request the Senate of Sydney University
to afford students at country technical colleges and
trade schools the same privileges as are now granted
to students at Sydney Technical College?
The answer was :
Country technical colleges, such as those at New-
castle and Broken Hill, receive the same privileges
as those now granted to the Sydney Technical College.
In a statement recently issued by the Senate
the following passage occurs: —
Sydney University, unlike some others, has invari-
ably required the attendance of its undergraduates....
The only exception to this rule is the acceptance from
the Sydney Technical College of certificates in cer-
tain subjects.
In other words, the Senate says to the
country, “If you can’t afford to come to
Sydney to acquire learning, stay at home and
remain illiterate!” And the Minister of
Education (of all people!) says “Hear hear. ’
Our dreadful habit of paying for every-
thing out of loans and never wiping out any
debt is landing us in more trouble. A “good
roads” agitation has made a vigorous start
in N.S.W., and has got so far that it is
reckoned an up-to-date highway can be made
from Penrith to Mount Victoria, at the back
door of Sydney, for £580,000, or £14,680 per
mile. The State’s railways cost —in loan
money—about £16,500 for line and rolling
stock and all equipment. And, of course, the
roads must be made Avitli loans too. Bad
authorities reckon that if the Slate borrows
money and builds plenty of highways for
the use of the public, the State loan-roads
will take so much trade from the State loan-
railways that the State won’t know whai
to do with itself in its joy.
Senator Kingsmill, of Westralia, extracted
the information that the cost of building the
Fordsdale, Australia’s biggest completed
effort, was £858,500. That is a trifle over
£BB per ton gross, or three times more than
some experts say there is the least hope of
earning interest on. The Fordsdale, like its
coming sister, the Ferndale, is no glittering
passenger boat, but just a marine maid-of-
all-work, with a net register of 5800 tons
and capable of doing 18 knots per hour.
Kingsmill was flatly refused information as
to the price at which the Shipping Board
took over the new property, and that lias
led folk to speculate that there was a solid
writing-down of the book value before the
taking over was accomplished. This is only
a suspicion, but if the ship isn’t in the
Board’s accounts at its exact price, neither
more nor less, then it simply amounts to
juggling with the national finances.
One of the biggest worries of the Vic.
Forestry Commission is that large forest
areas that should be conserved are still under
the Lands Department; and with the latter
possessing the power to lease out territory
which should be afforested, the timber posi-
tion grows very serious. It is absurd, any-
how, that the Lands and Forests should be
given control of contiguous areas, for, with
the firestiek happening as a matter of course
in one section, the danger to the other,
despite the activities of the scattered for-
esters, is increased a hundredfold. The
Australian Forest League is trying to edu-
cate Governments into a more benevolent
frame of mind regarding the timber future
generally; but with one Cabinet rapidly suc-
ceeding another it is like talking to a cloud
of dust.
The “throwing open” of 36 improved farms,
of from 3229 to 2592 acres, and in a few
cases more, in Riverina, led to the usual
rush, which is said to demonstrate the in-
tense land hunger that exists. There were
over 1900 applicants. And if the N.S.W.
Government had offered 36 cash prizes of
£lOOO each, with no entrance fee, there
would probably have been a fair number of
applicants also. The exact value of a home-
stead farm varies, but with a perpetual lease
at a rental of 21 per cent, of the nominal
value, and no revaluation for 25 years, the
chance of dodging personal residence and
some minor benefits, it is always reckoned a
very good horse to draw in Tatt.’s.
The Egyptian dignitary may not be great
on foresight, but there is nothing wrong
with his Coptic nerve. The first coat of
paint isn't dry on his new Parliament, but
ultimatums are being served quite briskly.
The Premier desires control of the Suez
Canal, and “restoration” of the Soudan —
the Soudan whose people were coming in
force to throw all Egypt into the sea when
Britain saved the situation ; and they would
probably be glad to come again. Possibly
British theorists will get tired, one of these
days, of trying to bestow “popular govern-
ment” on peoples who never took the trouble
to bestow it on themselves when they had
the chance. ’Hie colored ideal is big-stick
administration, with the proviso that the
stick shall be used honestly and fall hard in
the right place.
One witness before the New States Com-
mission said that Sydney management is so
casual in dealing with the remote parts of its
over-large domain that, when bis town
wanted a local holiday gazetted for some
local show or other, the holiday was not only
fixed at the wrong time but given to the
wrong town.

Hurrah for the flag of the British race
And the new flags marching on!
Open the book of our history,
Write on it clear and high:
We led the way for the East to slay—
Hip, hip ! Whaffor ! Banzai!
For the pride of race is a fetich
Set up by the men of old,
Who held that their own traditions
W ere cleaner than all the gold
That might be gained from a friendship
With folk ’neath the Eastern sky;
But we know more than “the men of yore—
Hip, hip ! Whaffor i Banzai!
So help for our rag-time allies,
For the cheap-wage Jap and John ;
A good leg-up for Rangoon Singh—

The div. rate was the usual 10 p.c., but a
bonus of 21 p.c. (£6250) is payable out of
the reserve of non-taxable War Loan interest,
in which £20,437 was held on May 31 last.
Lost year’s contribution to this reserve was
£3833; each year’s additions are included
with profits in the introductory table. This
big Rockhampton storekeeping concern,
which also has innumerable agencies, has had
a very prosperous career. The present co.
began 23 years back with £93,750 paid capi-
tal, and only £11,250 more has been called
in; but _it did so well between 1910-18
that £145,000 of reserves were capitalised—
taking paid capital to a quarter-million—
and all debentures on which the co. had
worked for many years were redeemed a
couple of years ago. Even after paying hand-
some divs. on the bonus-enlarged capital,
£188,584 of reserves (including £18,530 in an
insurance fund) have accumulated. Though
the co. may not be doing so well as it used
to, considering tne larger funds now employed,
the £43,380 left for the past 12 months
after depreciating properties by £4007 was
17* p.c. on the £250,000 of capital. The
year’s gross profits amounted to £133,770,
and £86,390 went in salaries, management
exes., taxes, etc.
The next table details the remarkable ex-
pansion of balance-sheet figures in 14 years,
during which period only £11,250 of new
capital was called in, together with £629.1
of share premiums :

Freeholds and
investments 53,482 140,558 146,037 140,734
Total liabilities are now £2049 less than in
1910. Meanwhile the book value of assets
has soared from £277,429 to £548,842, and
probably during the long prosperous run
some of the balance-sheet items have been
written down hard. From every point of
view the old business is extraordinarily snug.
The big composite item of freeholds and in-
vestments includes War Loan—five years ago
the directors stated that £102,000 of Gov-
ernment lOU’s was held —and steamship
(A.U.S.N.) scrip. When the final div. and
bonus had been paid, there were assets with
a book value of £5 16s. to guarantee every
£1 owed to outsiders; and after providing
cover for all debt, every one of the quarter-
million of shares was represented by 355.
of assets —all except a few shillings of which
could be classed as liquid assets. Walter
Reid’s is thus splendidly equipped to continue
to earn good divs. under efficient manage-
ment. Indeed, the future of the northern
State offers such possibilities that, notwith-
standing the decline of such an old stand-by
as the Mount Morgan mine, Walter Reid
prospects are very bright.

This has been a consistent 10 p.c. proposi-
tion. For some years after Edwards-Dunlop
stock was listed on ’Change in 1915 it paid
that rate on £254,231 of ordinaries; lately
£15,000 more lias been required to give the
s . Mne rate on £50,000 of bonus scrip issued
o" u t' reserves in 1919 and £lOO,OOO sub-
scrib at par by shareholders. Though
visible earnings are not so large in propor-
tion to capital as they used to be- —disclosed
profits for the past year, after extracting
pref. divs., returned 9.7 p.c. on ordinary
funds, compared with 10.3 p.c. in 1917-
surpluses over and above 10 p.c. on capital
have probably been larger than the accounts
have shown. A lot of profit has been taken
to write down book values, and probably a
substantial amount of this internal lay-by
will ultimately prove to be actual profit
earned. In their latest report the directors
say that stocks have been valued “at replace-
ment cost or less”—paper prices, by the way,
again declined a little during the year—and
"provision has been made for any further
decline in market values.” Besides, “adequate
provision has been made for any loss on book
debts or any fall in the value of the co.’s
investments.” Edwards-Dunlop not only sup-
plies the printing and stationery trade; it
is also a very large financier: compared with
£159,918 of stocks held at April 30. it had
accounts and bills for £379,506.
The business had been established almost
half a century when the first accounts were
made public nine years back. The following
table show’s how’ figures have expanded in
that period: also the changes which took
place when the paper market went mad :
1915. 1921. 1923. 1924.

ments .. . 17,348 122,406 190,608 196,224
Book values were so well protected in the
period of abnormally high prices that stocks
were cleared without apparent loss. Much
of the turnover was possibly under contracts ;
nevertheless, a large portion of the stocks
had to be absorbed by printers and retailers
who were hard hit in the slack period which
followed the depression. The book value of
stocks held at April 30 last was smaller than
at any time since the co.'s accounts have been
made public. A feature of the business is
that against £116,858 of outside liabilities
Edwards-Dunlop showed £186,11S of cash,
Government securities and shares in other
cos. after paying the year’s final div. Its
position is, therefore, very comfortable. Hav-
ing more funds than it at present requires for
the business, the co. is equipped to develop
its interests without calling upon sharehold-
ers. The larger financing of the printing
trade, which generally is in a poor condition,
has expanded turnover: that for the last
year, notwithstanding the further decline of
prices, was the largest on record, excepting,
of course, the year in which paper-goods were
at peak war prices. Ordinaries, by the way,
are helped by £86,509 of pref. capital carry-
ing only 5 p.c.: on the other hand, the co.
has a lot of its funds invested in War Loans.
The market has taken so great a fancy to
the scrip that it is paying 335. for assets with
a book value of 295. 4d., and, in anticipation
of better things to come, is satisfied with a
return of only slightly more than 6 p.c.

The directors dipped into reserves for £4401
to pay the usual 10 p.c.; but they had taken
£16,000 of the years earnings for deprecia-
tion, and the true net profit depends on how r
much was actually required under that head.
The £16,000 represented almost exactly 21
p.c. on the average amount invested in the
power-house and all equipment, and after
striking off a little now and again (£2079
for the past 12 months ) this reserve now
amounts to nearly £lOO,OOO, or slightly
more than one-seventh of the total book
values of properties, buildings, plant, mains,
etc. These figures indicate that the 10 p.c.
divs. are not being paid without due regard to
wastage of assets. Besides the allowances
made for wear and tear of machinery, last
year’s earnings also bore special renewal
charges; some thousands were spent in re-
placing poles which had carried the Corpora-
tion’s mains for anything up to 15 years.
Here are some figures showing the develop-
ment of the enterprise in 10 years:—

The E. L. and P. S. Corp. began in a small
way by securing the electric-supply rights
for the municipality of Balmain in return
for solving that densely-populated district’s
garbage problem. The special Act which
ratified the agreement also permitted the
Corp. to widen its, field, and the enterprising
crowd who established the concern hastened
to take advantage of the privilege. It now
serves five municipalities, in which it has
exclusive rights for from 18 to 43 years.
Further expansion is restricted owing to the
surrounding districts having been captured
by the City Council E. L. Department; but,
as the increase in the number of consumers
shows, the demand in the five crowded muni-
cipalities has grown rapidly, and possibilities
are not nearly exhausted.
The next table gives comparisons of
balance-sheet figures back to 1911:

There have been further big changes since
the accounts closed on April 30. The deben-
ture debt has been redeemed, and on July 15
lists closed for £150,000 of new shares at
par. The issue was fully subscribed. By the
end of this month £26,250 (3s. 6d.) will have
been paid, and the directors can make calls
of ss. per month to extinguish the overdraft
which was required to pay off debentures and
give shareholders their final div. At April
30 the co. had £10,827 of cash on hand, and
it had to return £50,000 to debenture-holders
on May 31 and pay shareholders £22,901 on
June 24. However, the new capital should
give the management adequate funds for some
time: latest additions to plant are capable
of supplying a larger demand for current.
Assuming that the new shares are soon called
to 10s. each, paid capital will have been
increased to £575.000, and 10 p.c. on that will
require £57,500 p.a. For the past two years
the average net profit (including interest on
the debentures which have now been re-
deemed) has been under £46,000, after
laying aside an average of £14,500 for
depreciation and paying for special re-
newals. The maintenance of the pre-
sent rate of divs. is therefore a little un-
certain ; the recent growth of the business
may just about permit payment of the regu-
lar div. rate for the current year if working
costs are not enlarged, and if no further
large amounts are required for renewals
other than those provided for by the depreci-
ation reservations. The management can
certainly be depended upon to make the most
of its opportunities; the E. L. and P. S. Corp.
has been capably managed from the begin-
ning, and, provided labor does not become
utterly unreasonable, it should have no dif-
ficulty in earning good divs. in future. Even
now its wires are connected with only 15,000-
odd of the 33,000 of houses, business pre-
mises and factories in the districts in which
it has the exclusive rights. Its charges to
consumers are, by the way, controlled by
Act of Parliament, and the municipalities
have the right to purchase the undertaking,
at valuation, at stated periods. The munici-
palisation of the business is a remote con-
tingency, provided the co. gives efficient ser-
vice, because the councils concerned are not
likely to have cheap funds available for the
purchase for many years, and municipal
enterprises have become as malodorous to
ratepayers as State enterprise.

The Colonial Mutual opened its Industrial
branch in 1909 and in the following year
took over the old Standard Co.’s business.
The table goes back to the time when sur-
pluses had extinguished accumulated deficits
—the department was £42,964 to the bad at
one stage apart from the actuarial liability
under policies. Policy-getting has been brisk:
premium income last year was treble that
of 1914. The first lot of bonuses followed
the 1921 valuation; the next year the
bonuses were increased 50 p.c.; and for the
past 12 months 33 p.c. has been added to
the previous year's distributions. Bonuses
now range from 2 p.c. on policies 10 years
in force to 1 p.c. on policies less than three
years on the books, and have taken £37,814
of the £47,669 by which the funds in the
table above exceeded the amount required by
the actuary. The Colonial Mutual has intro-
duced several innovations in its Industrial
operations. It claims to have been the first
life office in the British Empire to apply non-
forfeiture rules to Industrial contracts, pro-
tecting policy-holders from lapses through
inadvertence or temporary misfortune. The
concession has been in operation for three
years, and the directors say that results have
been “entirely satisfactory.” The manage-
ment has been still more enterprising in
establishing a welfare and nursing service,
which is doing good national work and is
not costing the society much. There are
now 15 nurses connected with the branch, and
in the two years thousands of visits have
been paid to sick policy-holders, and 1,148,000
health leaflets have been distributed. The cost
last year was £3607 —it is made a first charge
on the surplus—and the directors say that
there is already evidence of a reduction in
death claims, "at the same time increasing
the prestige of the society, and making it less
costly for it to carry on its business."
The Accident Department lias also been
doing better: —

This branch is conducted on a purely mutual
basis; the Colonial Mutual was the first
Australian office to pay bonuses on Accident
policies in the form of permanent additions
to the benefits contracted for. Hitherto the
bonuses have added 2 p.c. each year to the
benefits, but as the actuary has accumulated
a general reserve of £25,000 over and above
the provision for unexpired risks, on this
occasion the bonus rate has been increased
to 24 p.c., absorbing £4833 of the £6489
surplus disclosed. This section of the busi-
ness. has not grown as rapidly as might have
been expected considering the bonus attrac-
tions.
The Colonial Mutual’s assets (amalgamat-
ing the figures of Ordinary, Industrial and
Accident branches) now amount to
£7,234,451. The principal items are:
Public securities, £4,401,663; loans on mort-
gage, £1,027,305 ; premises, £951,787 (includ-
ing the Equitable Building, Melbourne, which
was purchased last year for £280,000) :
loans on policies. £546,129; cash and accrued
interest, £201,537. During the year substan-
tial parcels of Government stocks were sold
and they realised £40,000 over and above their
book values. Most of this “profit”—prob-
ably largely derived by writings-down in
previous years—was employed to reduce the
hook values of low-interest securities bought
in pre-war times.

Returns from investments made in affluent
days alone saved Mt. Morgan from heavy
loss for the financial year ended May.
After passing £31,527 into the depreciation
reserve, which was much less than the usual
annual allowance, mining, treatment and
metal-selling operations showed a loss of
£65,091but investments gave the best har-
vest on record (£49,817), and the net loss
for the period was only £15,274. Details

The loss of £15,274 may not represent the
true result. The financial year opened with
1978 tons copper unsold, which had been
taken into the 1923 accounts at £55 per ton,
and it closed with 2018, valued at that cus-
tomary figure. The year’s profit benefited
by the difference between actual sales
and the low book valuation; similarly the
current term will gain by the selling margin
on slightly larger stocks taken in at £55.
Probably the actual loss last year, assuming
the depreciation was adequate and sufficient
was spent on development and prospecting,
was a good deal under £15,000. But that is
quite bad enough considering that the big
mine has been weakened to the extent of
242,021 tons ore raised, from which were
won 4729 tons copper (fine) and 73,1610 z.
gold which can never be replaced. Alto-
gether in three years the whole of the pro-
ceeds from the sale of 11,389 tons copper
and 149,3510 z. gold, besides £81,415 earned
by investments, have been short to the extent
of £llO,OOO-odd in covering charges, in-
cluding depreciation (£109,138). That has
been a very serious set-back to a co. whose
principal assets are of a wasting type, and
under ordinary circumstances it would be bad
business to continue to allow capital thus
to fade away.- Morgan’s big trouble has
been, and still is. the poor market for cop-
per—not in the demand, but in price. Every

Australian copper-mine of importance except
Morgan is down-and-out because costs of
production cannot be brought below the
world’s market price, though elsewhere,
under cheap labor conditions, copper pro-
ducers are making handsome profits.
Mt. Morgan’s stand-by in its years of dis-
tress has been the gold contents of its ores.
The past 12 months gave gold returns much
better than the run-of-the-mine average, the
“ordinary course of mining” having given,
for Morgan, bonanza values. Ore reserves
average 6.o2dwt. gold; but the 66,834 tons
of smelting ore last year gave a recovery of
more than a half-ounce (10.41 dwt.), while
172,326 tons ore concentrated assayed
s.Bsdwt. For every ton fine copper pro-
duced last year 15.50 z. gold' were won, com-
pared with 11.40 z. in 1923, 11.60 z. in 1922,
and 12.30 z. in 1914. Meanwhile, the metal-
lurgical practice has been so improved that
for the latter half of last year 96.45 p.c. of
copper contents of the ore were recovered in
concentrating and 83.45 p.c, of the gold, and,
besides, the mill was working more efficiently
in other respects. The improved recov-
eries, the directors say, have rendered un-
necessary the continuance of experimental
work on the re-treatment of the mill tails.
Meanwhile experiments have been successful
in expelling more sulphur from mill products,
and attention is now being given to another
smelting bugbear, the silica in the concen-
trates. But all these improvements are
only a drop in the Morgan bucket compared
with the effect which a few pounds’ increase
in the price of copper would give. The
average for electrolytic last year was £73 7s.
10d., compared with £72 6s. 9d. for the pre-
vious 12 months, £73 11s. for 1922, and
£ll5 in 1920.
Though losses on mining operations have
been heavy, Morgan has not lost weight in
its balance-sheets after having invested, or
held in cash form, the amounts reserved for
depreciation. The following table shows how
the liquid position moved between 1914 and
the peak year of cashable assets (1922), and
also shows the small decline in the past two
years : —•

are proprietary cos. and do not publish
accounts. Metal Manufactures has developed
into a great industry which is turning out a
variety of copper products—particularly elec-
tric cables—hitherto wholly imported, and
nowadays it should be doing well. Probably
the new super, works are also on the div.
list. The Morgan position at present is as
follows : every £1 share is represented by cash
assets (taking stocks at only £55 per ton) of
Bs. 4d. after paying off all outside debt; and
in shares in Kembla enterprises there is
7s. 6d. per share more. Besides them are the
mines and all equipment, with known ore
reserves of 2,851.651 tons going 2.59 copper
and 6.o2dwt. gold, and with large bodies out-
side the measured zones : last year 180,540
tons were mined from the reserves and 61,481
tons came from other quarters. What these
ore reserves will be worth is the big “if” in
Mt. Morgan’s future.
* * * *
An odd balance-sheet is that of the North-
ern Territory Land Co., of Adelaide. In the
long-ago it acquired 73,000 acres in the N.T.
at 7s. 6d. per acre, and the present value is
entirely problematical. The co. has £3OOO
invested in War Loan and Government secu-
rities, and £l6O of interest was the only in-
come recorded by the 43rd lot of accounts.
The directors’ report is a model of brevity:
“There has been no opportunity of dealing
with the co.’s land during the last year. _ The
income is sufficient to cover expenses.” A
strong directorate of five is content with nine
guineas in fees, “charges” amounted to only
£2B, but land-tax hit up the little co. for £94.
Even so, there was a profit of £27.

One of the most impudent raids ever made
on the Commonwealth is that now being
engineered by an English co. called the Brit-
ish Allied Estates, Ltd., which has flooded
the G.P.O. with what purports to be the
“latest edition” of a newspaper, “Oil-Lands
News,” but which is only an accumulation
of advertising of the cheapest ’Murkan type.
The British Allied Estates claims to have
bought up areas in the “midst of the most
prolific oilfield of modern times” in Arkan-
sas (U.S.A.), and its benevolence is so great
that it has journeyed all the way to the
Commonwealth to sell 1100 sq. ft. “gusher
plots” at a fiver apiece. When the pocket-
handkerchief allotments (11yd. x 11yd.)
have been sold, the B.A.E. proposes to en-
gage a geologist and drilling expert to put
down the wells, and the plot-holder is to
get 25 p.c. of the net profits from oil-produc-
tion—and that “may mean a fortune of
anything from £5OOO to £50,000 in return
for your £5 speculation.” In accordance
“with the co-operative participation plan,”
65 p.c. of the net profits of any section will
be divisible among other plot-holders, and
the vendor concern is to take the balance for
its administrative work. The invitation to
the public is overloaded with numerous
shrieks in heavy type, but the promoters
do not bother to tender any expert geological
opinion on the area, or to mention anything
about the constitution or personnel of the
vendor co. Why they should be offering “for-
tunes” for Australian “fivers” instead of de-
veloping “some of the richest oil-bearing
country in the world” on their own account
is an unexplained mystery.

Oil-prospecting cos. for German New
Guinea are blossoming freely in Melbourne.
Rabaul Prospecting Co., with £35 cash in
hand and debts of £173, proposes forming
a new co. to prospect 640 sq. miles at Eitape, in
the North-West. Capital is to be £lOO,OOO m £1
shares ; the Rabaul co. will annex 25,000 fully-
paids, and the public is offered 50,000, to be
paid to 4s. Another co., the Colonial Explora-
tion and Development Syndicate, has a modest
capital of £25,000 in £1 shares. The public
issue is 17,000 shares at 45., the vendors
taking 8000 shares and £5OO cash, practi-
cally a one-third interest. The oil license
covers 1000 sq. miles at Wanimo, on the
border between Dutch and German New
Guinea. M. M. Stewart reports having found
oil seepages and brine springs. It is pro-
posed to spend £6OOO on a geological survey,
though it is obvious that a very large sum
will be necessary afterwards for roads, plant,
machinery and boring.
“Tcthys”: The search for oil in the Pari-
tutu district, s.-e. of New Plymouth (M.L.),
dates back to 1865, although the Maoris
had found oil near the Sugar Loaf Islands
before Captain Cook called at the Dominion.
At 180 ft. petroleum was struck at the rate
of 50 gallons a week. For three years shal-
low holes were drilled with too little money,
and no logs were kept of the boring. In
1889 Julius Vogel formed a co. in London
which sank 15 holes, but the petroleum
produced was not in payable quantities. In
1904 another start was made by an Adelaide
co., with G. C. Fair driller. He reached
2100 ft. for an outlay of £lBOO. A second
co. carried the well to 2345 ft. and struck
good oil, but there was far too much water,
owing to defective casing. Up to 1910 many
holes were bored; petroleum was frequently
found, and immediately lost again because
those in charge generally did not bother to
shut off the water. The co. now being
formed in Melbourne will have a nominal
capital of £500,000 in £1 shares. Vendors
take £llO,OOO in paid-ups and £5OOO cash.
E. L. and C. Baillieu underwrite 150,000
shares, keeping 75,000 themselves and letting
the public have 75.000. The vendors pay the
underwriters £27,500 as commission, or 18
p.c. on £150.000. In addition the under-
writers will be given an option over 150,000
shares for two years at 355. each, and 90,000
will be reserved.
* * * *
Eugene de Hautpick, the Russian geolo-
gist, who bottomed on a dud in the Mersey
Valley (Tas.), is on the way to London
with hopes of interesting the oil world in
the Coorong district (S.A.), where he has
been superintending a job for the Goldfields
Diamond Drilling Co. London will probably
tell him very courteously, as it has told so
many other missioners, that it is fully booked
for oil specs., but will be glad to see him
when he has struck oil. The Coorong Oil Co.
has put down three scout bores, two miles
south of Salt Creek. The first bottomed at
350 ft. in what Hautpick called blue mud;
the second, one mile east, was stopped in
tertiary sediments at 350 ft.; and in the third
borehole the drill went through an “oil
sand” between 300 ft. and 350 ft. Work ceased
at 750 ft., and so far Hautpick’s report has
not been made public.
Following several reports by mine-man-
agers and Mines Department officials which
gave Mt. Shenton (W.A.) a chance, three
directors decided to examine the Mt. Shenton
Co.’s holdings. The leases are 100 miles
east of Laverton, midway betw r een Perth
and the S. Aus. border. The Directors
planned to cart the rich stuff reported to be
at grass by camel teams to Laverton, and
with the cash proceeds to erect a plant to
deal with the 50,000 tons of ounce material
stated to be awaiting treatment. A cursory
examination caused the directors to alter
their programme. The numerous quartz reefs
■were found to he in granite country, cer-
tainly slightly enriched at the surface where
intersected by cross leaders. Half a dozen
shafts had been sunk on four flat makes, and,
excepting in one instance, the stone had cut
out 30ft. down, and in that one case values
in the bottom of the shaft were only 15dwt.,
and the stone did not look like lasting another
10ft. All the co. has to show for an outlay
of £3OOO are dumps having an estimated gold
content of about £6OO. The directors paid
off all hands and abandoned the dumps to
enterprising individuals who may make some-
thing out of them by carting picked stuff to
Laverton. The “Golden Hole,” which had
been so much talked about, consisted of an
underlie shaft sunk on a flat “squib” a few
inches wide and averaging less than an ounce.

For many years the Ida H. Co. made good
profits from a Westralian mine, but when no
more divs. appeared to be in sight it shut
down and went on a world’s tour in search
of something else. Finally it settled on a
tin-field in Nigeria. At a shareholders’ meet-
ing held in Condon the other day the chair-
man said the co.’s new holding adjoined that
of another old Westralian absentee, the Cen-
tral and West Boulder Co., and an arrange-
ment had been made for the two properties
to be tributed jointly. The Westralian in-
terests of both concerns have been disposed of.
Mt. Isa Prop. (Q.) reports are now pre-
sented in a much more satisfactory form.
Hitherto developments throughout the field
have been recorded in vague terms —“good
ore,” “in values,” etc. —though widths have
usually been reported. The Prop, now has
an assayer at work, and shareholders are
told that 31ft. of lode at 59ft. in the Even
Break shaft is going 19 p.c. lead and that a
foot of it runs to 49 p.c. The Out-on-Her-
Own is showing 31ft. at 46ft. averaging 9
p.c., and 63ft. in the tunnel 3ft. is going
25 p.c. The Ibus at 80ft. is in 2ft. of ore
assaying 201 p.c.

A machinery inspector, recently returned
from a visit to the Palmer mines, at May-
town (Q.), on behalf of a Cairns syndicate
which is de-watering some of the old mines,
was surprised at the almost uncanny state
of preservation of machinery that has lain
idle for over a score of years. After having
done only 10 months’ work in 30 years, a
large boiler was found perfectly clean and
sound. A 10-head battery that had ceased
crushing many years ago needed only a
week’s overhaul to put it in working order.
Joseph Campbell, North Queensland’s en-
thusiastic barracker for a generation, is as
keen as ever about his Belimbla Creek gold
proposition, near Nerrigundali, N. S. Wales
South Coast. He talked in superlatives in
the prospectus, and after six months’ work
says that he has nothing to retract —he is
“confident that the mines are destined to be
in the front-rank of Australia’s steady gold-
producers.” A 10-head battery is going up
and should be ready for crushing in October.
Meanwhile a tunnel is being driven from the
battery site into the big formation to permit
it to be opened up and mined in a big way.
Also a little 5-head battery is being installed
to handle material from a 3oz. vein. The
larger battery is to be connected by tram-line
with the northern end of the leases, where
from an open-cut sdwt. to 6dwt. stone will
come from a formation 10ft. to 12ft. wide,
and later this area is expected to give
30dwt. stuff. When the tunnel is completed
Campbell talks of 23 chains of lode making
175 ft. of backs available. The whole show
oozes optimism: “from surface indications
another valuable lode will be cut before the
main objective is reached; in fact, it appears
as if the whole hillside is auriferous and
values may be met with any week.” The
tunnel is in 200 ft. and has to go 800 ft.

“Allendale”: For the enlightenment of
“Old ’Un” (B. 10/7/’24) here are some
official records. Madam Berry West paid
£90,000 in divs. and royalties on a called-up
capital of £9OOO. Madam Berry, which was
more than 300 ft. deep, called up £15,975,
won £1,588,515 of gold and paid a little over
a million in divs. and royalties. The New
Ristori is on the south end, or starting point,
of the Berry leads, and is miles away from
Spring Hill and Central Leads and the
deeper mines.
* * * *
From a Maoriland mining-engineer:—
Much nonsense is being written about gold-
dredging possibilities in the Shotover and Kawarau
rivers. The Shotover was rushed in 1862, and at
one time as many as 3000 white men worked the
bed and banks. Sons of the old pioneers followed in
their fathers’ footsteps, and a good deal of hydrau-
licing was done with water from the mountain sides.
Nearly the whole of the river bed was worked. The
miners, a hardy class, worked the bed by putting a
wall down the centre, and by the aid of wings one
side was worked, and when this was completed the
wings were carried round and the other side was
tackled. Chinese followed and cleaned up the
poorer ground. When the dredging boom was on,
the Shotover bed was claimed to be rich in gold;
nevertheless, a dredge at Maori Point, said to be
one of the richest portions, had only two or three
good returns, and they were from the bit of solid
ground under the old walls left by the miners; on
either side of the walls the dredge could not pay
working expenses. About the same time the Sand-
hills dredge, driven by hydro-electric power, started
traversing some five miles of river higher up, but it
failed to pay a div.
Centrifugal pumps, hydro-electrically driven, have
more recently been tried on certain parts that were
reported rich. The result was disastrous. The
bulk of the gold was originally deposited on a false-
bottom, which ranged in depth to 150 ft. Evidently
there had been a large lake just below the head-
waters of the Shotover, and during one of the
early glacier periods this was carried away and huge
quantities of lake d&bris were deposited over the
course of the gorge on a much higher level than the
present bed. In places large moranic deposits were
left behind as the glacier moved forward, and in the
course of time gold-bearing detritus was carried for-
ward by the same process and lodged on top of the
old moraines. It was on this false bottom that
the miners won the bulk of their gold. All gold
on the rock bottom of the river bed was deposited
there by the breaking down of the terraces.
The river’s course is through mountainous country,
and any suggestion of diverting is arrant nonsense.
A short stretch or two may be diverted ; in fact, one
attempt was made and proved a failure.

“Det Selloc”: The edge of a movie-like
racial drama was touched on at the Sydney
Coroner’s inquiry into the drowning of a
woman at the finish of a wine orgy in the
Domain the other day. According to the
skipper of an Island steamer the deceased
was the daughter of a trader of Tofua and
his native wife. She grew up a handsome
and accomplished girl, married a commercial
traveller in Tonga, and helped to rear a
family in Auckland, before starting on the
downward grade. She came to Sydney in
1919, to get her living as best she could,
and, although frequently in domestic employ-
ment, something seemed to drive her to the
out-door gipsy life. She frequented the
Domain and mixed with a group of city
beachcombers —men who often earned good
money as seamen and wliarf-laborers,
but preferred to spend tlieir nights and idle
days in the open. One of these stated m
evidence that an impulse to throw off her
clothes and swim the harbor in moments ot
elation was one of her most troublesome

characteristics. She made two such at-
tempts on the night of the wine orgy near
the Domain baths, and the second proved
fatal. * * *
The Watson’s Bay (Sydney) con-
stable who picks up the discarded clothes
and farewell letters of the people who go over
the Gap at South Head, or want their friends
to believe they have done so, found his ser-
vices requisitioned by a sadly disillusioned
and justly indignant woman the other morn-
ing. It appeared from her story that she
had dramatically informed her relatives that
she was going over the cliffs. Then she fled
for the Watson's Bay boat; but a cold wait
of two hours on wind-swept rocks failed to
bring the confidently anticipated rush of peni-
tent kinsfolk to rescue her. Either they
didn’t believe her, or didn’t care a darn; so
the angry lady went to the local police-station
and gave the constable the job that her own
family had neglected.
“X.N.0.”: Talking of ships lost through

“Yarra Ben”: Mel-
bourne is becoming a
city of gastronomic
slogans. “Eat More

way-station poster.
“Every day raisins!”
echoes another hoard-
ing ; and “Take a loaf
of raisin-bread home
with you to-day” is im-
pressed upon a de-
fenceless public. Now
there is a glut of
cheese. People, it
seems, haven’t been
taking enough of it at
their meals, possibly
because they haven’t
been able to afford the
bread to eat with it.
So I foresee a new and
elegant sign, “Chew
more cheese!’ And
after that who
knows? The fish indus-
try could probably do
with a boost. What
about “Crunch more

the stone-flagged swimming-
bath are still to be seen. The

placed by buildings which m-

Public hangings used to take

alive in I-Iobart who can tell
of an extraordinary scene lie

man about to be hanged for
rape solemnly declared that
he was not guilty of the
crime; he admitted that he
had stayed with the woman
for a few days during her
husband’s absence on a fish-
ing-cruise, but insisted that
when the husband returned
unexpectedly the wife had
framed the rape story to
account for his presence in
her room. He finished with
a prediction that neither hus-
band nor wife would survive
him long. The crowd was
strangely moved by his
words; the story goes on to
relate how the very same
afternoon the woman died
from snakebite, and a few
days later the fisherman hus-
band got one of his fingers
caught in a link of his anchor-chain as he
was dropping it from his boat, and went
down with it.

“Spare Corporal”: The queerest souvenir
I ever heard of came from Ypres. Most Dig-
gers, much as they hated the neighborhood,
had a sentimental regard for the place that
typified so piteously the suffering of invaded
France under Hun hammerblows. When I
took my last look at the town, in February
1918, there were a few walls left here and
there, but never a complete house. There was
only one sign remaining in the whole place—
that of “L’Aiglon D’Or,” a familiar cate
which faced the railway square. Its survival
was almost as much a subject for comment
amongst the Diggers as that of the statue
of the Virgin at Albert. But one of the
letters was gone from the sign: according to
EVIDENTLY A MISTAKE OF THE TOWN CLOCK.
THE WEARY HOSTESS : “Is that twelve striking? Oh, no, it can't
he, because I told your mother that you would he home by
twelve, and you haven’t even got your hat yet."
local legend, a Digger had souvenired it.
How he expected to smuggle out si tali,
gilded letter Heaven knows; but the chances
are that the unique trophy of destroyed ipres
is somewhere in Australia to-day.
“Ex-Dig.”: Some Digger sentries were
scornful of the conventions. Once, going
on “rounds,” we heard a challenge out of the
darkness —“ ’Ere, you, pull up ! What s your
game?”—and, in reply to the orthodox re-
sponse, “Friends, are yer? Shove yer frames
forward an’ let’s have a quiz at yer . lhe
orderly-officer looked pained, and asked
Sentry to detail his duties. “See that bloom-
in’ track?” said Roughasbags, scrambling un-
tidily to attention and unscrambling again.
“I’ve gotter mooch up and down that, and
’old up any mugs ’oo come ’anging around
and get their guts. If they don’t pull up
when they ’ear me chat ’em, I plugger bullet
inter them; and if anything over the odds
’appens I gotter raise ell and the guard.
Then the storm burst; but Roughasbags wore
an injured ’air when he was reproached with
forgetting the book of the words. It s a
silly blanky business, anyway,” he pro-
nounced casually. “If they’re so damn par-
ticular about the words, why don t they set
’em to music?”
# * * *
“Machete”: The Melbourne gaol warder
who sold pieces of the ropes with which mal-
efactors had been hanged (B. l</i/24) was
supplying a long-established demand. One
of the most profitable side-lines of a hang-
man’s job in the good old days was the
touching of children and others suffering
from the king’s evil (scrofula) with liis bit
of hemp. It was considered as efficacious as
the Royal touch (which Samuel Johnson
received in infancy from Queen Anne) and
much easier to obtain. I never heard of the
rope as a luck bringer. That was the attri-
bute of the dried hand of the criminal. It
had to be taken at midnight from the body
on the gibbet; and when the countryside of
Merrie England was dotted with dangling
corpses, most of them were handless before
the weather and the crows completed the
disintegrating process.

“Jimmy Possum”: Bill Bushman may
occasionally be a laggard in love; but not all
who find their way out into the bush are
slow or bashful in their courting processes.
I have a vivid recollection of a young Ger-
man riding up to our place in South Banana-
land, and asking to see a young lady rela-
tive who was staying with us at the time. We
had never seen the man or even heard of him ;
but as soon as the damsel showed up Fritz
doffed his hat politely and, having intro-
duced himself, without further ado and betoie
us all proposed on the spot from horsebacK.
When told there was no hope, he politely saiu
good-bye and rode off. That unorthodox
wooer toured the district in search of a wife,
proposing in turn to various young women,
until he was accepted by a well-to-do farmer s
daughter.
* * * *
“Simon Simple”: Even the British Navy
can hardly b e more thorough than the In-
dian cavalry. At the beginning of TG we
were camped near a brown regiment, wherein
the practice existed of parading two more
than the number required for guard every
evening, and excusing from duty the two
best turned out. One evening the officer ot
the day found it impossible to pick the win-
ners by ordinary means, so he ordered trie
men to remove the oil-bottles and puff-
throughs” from the butts of their rifles. All
had polished their oil-bottles; two had in
addition, polished the brass weights of their
pull-throughs, and to these went the honors.
Incidentally, our C.O. was struck with the
bright idea of trying the same scheme on
his own men. But it didn’t act. After a week
or so William James came to the conclusion
that he would sooner do a blanky guard
than go to the blinking trouble of getting
himself up like a movie actress.

“Norman H.”: Dunwich, Queensland's
home for the old ’uns, houses some quaint
characters. One old chap claims that his
mother was with Florence Nightingale
through the Crimea, and that subsequently
she was one of the very few who escaped
from the shambles at Cawnpore during the
Indian Mutiny. He is still hoping for the
day when he will be able to substantiate his
claim to her considerable estate in Chancery.
Another, also nearing the century mark, is
the sole surviving link with a ghastly tragedy
perpetrated in the Gulf Country about bU
years ago. He was a book-keeper on the
station at the time the crime occurred, and
for years it was believed that he had it m
his power to draw aside the veil and tell
exactly what happened. It is unlikely he
ever Avill now, for his mind has given way.
Although he did not actually break the bank,
another old character claims that his sys-
tem” at Monte Carlo was a sure winner.
But Paris swallowed up not only his win-
nings, but what he had got from the sale of
a sheep-station in N. S. Wales, and he had
to ship back to Australia as a deckhand.
He is still practising his “system, ’ and is
certain that the tide would run again it only
he could get back to the tables.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Shingling is all the rage, hats are small and
simple, stockings are mainly flesh-colored, and skirts
continue short and tight.”
Sing me a song of a shingled mane
Under a speck of a hai that goes
Sweetly simple and neatly plain;
Paint me a picture of legs and toes
Cased in the daintiest flesh-hued hose—
These are the fashions that eyes delight.
Build me an idyll, but not in prose,
Over the skirts that are short and tight.
Where are the feet that, in Suckling’s strain,
Mouselike stole for enraptured beaus
Out of their shelter and in again,
Under the flounces and furbelows?
Vanished and obsolete, I suppose:
Only a memory, fled from sight
Like the whirled-ofl leaves and the melted snows,
In a day when skirts must be short and tight.
The billowy blouse and the sweeping train,
The raiment over a frame that flows,
Where is it? When will it come again?
No man may guess and no woman knows;
No signs forecast and no spooks disclose.
But, lithe-limbed nymphs, let your hearts be light,
Since fashion’s world no weakening shows
On the mode that skirts shall be short and tight.

“Ilido”: A merry and melodious little
actress lately in Melbourne was hampered
with an earnest middle-aged admirer for
whom she had no kind of use. The bald
Lothario was regular in his attendance at the
flat, alternating protestations of his deep re-
gard with threats 1 , of self-destruction if Miss
Melody refused to listen to his suit. As the
vows of devotion and threats of suicide grew
more noisy, the other residents in the flats be-
gan to complain. Eventually the management
waited upon Miss Melody, and voiced its
objections—it could not have this man com-
mitting suicide on its mats. Here the lady
rose to the occasion. “I can’t drive him off,”
she chuckled ; “but I’ll tell you what I’ll do—
I'll buy some linoleum.”
“Smike”: Having put "Squizzy” Taylor
away for six months, the Melbourne police
are now pouncing on two-up and fan-tan
schools. A recent raid on a haunt yielded a
squad of unabashed gamblers, one of whom
refused to glory in the fact that his name
was Billy Hughes. Barring a peevish
ancient who was iu the middle of winning a
trip to China when the Johns interrupted his
happiness, they all paid their fines without
a murmur and retired with wooden faces to
meditate on the villainy of the white man’s
laws. From the police point of view this
affair was a complete success; but a more
ambitious drive against a two-up college was
a failure. The plan had been well re-

hearsed and a number of cops had been
heavily disguised ; but just as they were about
to spring on the mob, two ordinary bobbies,
who had not been warned of the impending
swoop, hove innocently into sight and the
startled quarry took to its legs before the
real offensive could be launched. There is no
fun in being a new policeman, in Melbourne
nowadays. Even if lie slips into some quiet
corner to nibble a pie. or suck at a tag, the
cold eye of a hostile afternoon reporter is
bound to catch him iu the act, and he is
roasted for a lapse which his predecessor
could have performed with impunity.

“C.H.R.”: “G.8.L.” (B. 10/7/’24) par-
ticularises where I generalised. In compar-
ing the results of
the gunnery
methods of two
nations —the Ger-
mans, hitting with
several shells to-
gether at long in-
tervals, and our
hitting with one
or two shells more
frequently—l said
the material dam-
age might he much
the same. I might
have added the
stock phrase, “other
things being equal.”
The fact that the
Germans had the
luck at Jutland to
find a bad defect in
the design of our
ships not once but
three times doesn't
affect my argu-
ment. The size of
ou r casualty-list
was caused by three
battle-cruisers, In-
vincible, Indefati-
gable and Queen
Mary, sinking with
a 1 1 hands. li e-
member, too, that
our cruisers di d
most of the firing
on our side, and
our morale at the
end was as perfect
as before, whereas
that of the Ger-
mans was gone.
Regarding the
material damage,
if we allowed each
side, say, 100 points
for evex-y capital
ship sunk and 50
for every capital
ship put out ot ac-
tion for four weeks,
and so on, we would
come out well on
the right side. The
Ger ma n s didn’t
have a fleet for
three months after Jutland, whereas we
never ceased to have a most effective one.
“Lexo”: There was joy in a Jewish family
in Sydney recently when a daughter arrived.
Little Rebecca is the first female child to
be born in her father’s family for half a
century. Dad himself was one of a family
of 14—all boys. Rebecca’s grandfather had
seven brothers, but no sisters. The three
brothers who married had nine, 11 and 12
sons respectively, but no daughters. Rebecca
herself has six brothers, so her chances of
arriving were beginning to look very blue.

“Burglar’s Laborer" : The Protestant par-
son who wrote the other day to the S. M.
Herald to announce his discovery that
“Roman Catholics do not
form 24 per cent, of our
population, but they give us
42 per cent, of our gaol popu-
lation.” overlooked the fact,
even if his figures are correct,
that large numbers of gaol-
birds become R.C.’s for the
period of their incarceration,
for good and sufficient rea-
sons. One inducement is that
priests pay more attention
to the prisoners than minis-
ters of other denominations,
as a rule. Once when I was
making a trip to prison, my
neighbor put me wise:
“What's your religion? Take
my tip and be an R.C.” If
the S. M. Herald’s parson
wants to argue the point on
the figures, he should first
take a peep at the A.I.F.
records, when he will find
that, in proportion to their
number in the population,
the Roman Catholics gave an
undue proportion of soldiers
to the war. The same influ-
ence operated in both cases';
and the large gaol proportion
cannot be insisted upon with-
out an admission concerning
the A.I.F. figures also.
Edward Denman writes more regimental
history:—
“R, D. Robb" (B. 12/6/’24) > who contradicts my
statement that the “Buffs are the oldest regiment
in the British Army” and claims that honor for the
Ist Royals because it is numbered 1 in the Army
List falls into the common error that a regiment s
number denotes its antiquity. The system of num-
bering regiments was unknown in the English Army
until 1661 ; before that they were mostly distin-
guished by the name of their commanding officer.
Hence the Buffs was consecutively “The Holland,"
“Churchill’s,” “Sir Philip Sidney’s,” “Prince George
of Denmark’s,” the “Duke of Argyle’s” and “Ogle-
thorp’s” regiment. The Buffs actually came into
SAVING HIS FACE.

MARTHA : “It’s a sure sign, m’dear, when a husband comes home
and starts talking about the advantages of saving money.”
being in March, 1572, when Queen Elizabeth gave
orders that 3000 men should be selected from the
London trainbands as men-at-arms, 300 of whom
were detailed for service in the Netherlands. This
company was the nucleus of a numerous body of
British troops which fought in the Low Countries
during the reigns of Elizabeth, James I. and Charles
I. In 1665 Charles 11. demanded the return of the
so-called “Holland regiment.” Other regiments also
had been recalled home, and numbering was resorted
to; but the numbers the older regiments now bear
merely represent the order in which they arrived m
England. The “Douglas regiment,” now the “Royal
Scots,” arrived first; the “Tangier” regiment (now
known as the Queen’s) came second ; the “Admiral’s”
regiment followed (afterwards incorporated in the
2nd Foot Guards) ; and the “Holland” regiment was
fourth. In 1708 the title of the last was changed
to the Buffs, after its bufi facings, waistcoats,
breeches and stockings.

“Albert Park" : A Melbourne business man.
albeit no Scot, behaved in accordance with
the finest Caledonian traditions the other
night. Going home late, he was passing
across an open lot when two men came out
of the shadows and accosted him. First
they wanted a match, then they demanded all
the valuables the business man had about
him, and there being no ready compliance
opened an attack. Business Man entered
into the affair with such fine spirit that
presently he had one man down, thinking
hard. The other tried bouncing a brickbat
on his intended victim, but Business Man
survived even that, and renewed the engage-
ment with such vigor and velocity that the
marauders discovered discretion the better
part, and picking up their heels fled for their
live?. Business Man confesses he had on
him fourpence halfpenny and an evening
paper. But, he says, these rascals must be
taught a proper regard for property.

“Lao-dah”: In Manchu days it was the
“palace rats,” the eunuchs, who were the go-
betweens of the foreign embassies and the
Peking Government; to-day it is the house
servants of Cabinet Ministers. The man
responsible for the just-cabled final agree-
ments between China and Germany was Li
An-ch’ing, once the Chinese President’s “num-
ber-one boy.” While the Peking press flung
weighted ideographs at Wang Iv’o-min, the
Finance Minister, who had nothing to do
with the business, and while he was telling
the foreign ambassadors that he knew noth-
ing about it, the suave young man who used
to bring the President his morning tea was
bargaining secretly with the Teutons at
Tientsin. The questions at issue were very
mixed, and don’t matter much to Australia,
anyhow; but the settlement involves the
return of German property in China, and as
that gives the Teutons a footing again, it will
not be long before they regain all they lost
and more besides. That it was worth a
good deal to them is shown by the size of
Li’s “squeeze,” which his friends say
amounted to 10 or 15 million dollars.

“Wing" : Is there ill-luck in certain names
for particular families’? My great-grand-
father’s Christian name was James. He was
killed in a mining accident. A son, named
after him, was drowned in infancy. A second
son. also James, was my grandfather. Early
in middle-life he was blown over a Cornish
cliff during a storm. His son James died
young. Three of the latter’s brother- gave
the name to sons of their own. The first
died from strychnine-poisoning at four years
old: the second died suddenly at 10; the
third was killed in a motor accident at
29. Now no member of our family will call
a child James.
“Capta’’: 1 would like to suggest to
“Puree” (B. 3/7/'24» the probability of the
Parisian restaurant “Le Dingo” having re-
ceived that name from a French word, and
not after our sheep-killer. “Dingo” in
Parisian argot means “mad” or “cranky.” In
a once-popular French song. “The Goose-
step." there is a line reading “Nous etions
dingo." And “Paree” himself testifies that
the restaurant is “the noisiest, maddest place
this side of the Hereafter.”

English than “E.S.” pictured it (B. 20/3/’24).
Less than 20 per cent, of its 3000 or more
students are from overseas. An Oxford Eight has
never been captained by a Harvard graduate; even
a Dominion t n lergrad failed to secure election as
captain of the ' Rugby team last year, although lie
was the obvious choice. Balliol College, which “F.S.”
refers to as containing the intelligentsia of the
Orient, has less than 3 per cent, of Orientals, and
this is about the usual proportion for Oxford colleges.
Xor is University College “full” of Americans and
Chinese. It has at present no colored students, and
only about 3 per cent of Americans. Christ Church
has less than 2 per cent, colored men, and no more
than the usual 3 per cent, or 4 per cent, of Ameri-
cans. The leading literary journal of the University
was not edited by an American when “F.S.’s” article
was written. There have been two American presi-
dents of the Union in the last 10 years; I do not
think there was ever one before that. Far from
Oxford losing its best and finest characteristics
through its cosmopolitanism, the general opinion

THE TOUCHWOOD BOYS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Young Men’s Touch-wood-and-wliistle Associa-
tion has followed the polo fashion of having a club
song that may be sung at bunfights and muffin-
worries.”
The Touchwood boys are naughty
When they are going gay ;
They’re what the girls call “spawty”
When they’re out for the day.
They don’t go in for football—
It’s far too rough, you see;
But they’re the boys who make a noise
Like “Comeanavea bun with me.”
Comeanavea bun with me,
And a nice hot cuppa tea.
We’re the Rah! Rah ! boys, and we
make a noise
Like “Comeanavea bun with, me.’’
The Touchwoods play no polo,
They vote it much too slow;
But at patience, whist or solo,
They’ll give the world a go,
You'll never see them racing
For a motor-bike Grand Prix ;
But when they’re dry, you’ll hear them cry
“Comeanavea bun with me.”
Come along to the A.8.C.,
We’re out on a gorgeous spree.
We spare no cash on our annual splash,
So come and chew a bun with me.
They don’t go in for hockey,
Or noisy games like chess.
Their riding is rather rocky,
But at draughts they’re a huge success.
At forfeits or hunt the slipper •
They’re right at the top of the tree;
And at kiss-in-the-ring you’ll hear them sing
“Comeanavea tart with me.”
Comeanavea tart with me,
It’s the Touchwoods’ Jubilee,
And the O.K. dope at our Band of Hope
Is “Comeanavea tart with me.”

“The peach-tree Fan-tao blossoms every 2000
years.”
In the dream mountains somewhere beyond Cnina,
A million hopes from the last Tartar tent,
Once in two thousand years the boughs are bent
Upon a peach-tree whose lush fruit can sign a
Long truce with death and make a man s decline a
Deep quiet autumn in full reverie spent
From age to glistering age. So small content,
Ufist riving, blooms like Arabia alpina.
The peach of long, long life is far for seeking.
I would not ask to break its juicy rind
Or. see the first pink blossom break the sheath ;
But, just to keep life’s golden bowl from leaking,
I’d ask some useful god who doesn't mind
To let me grow a third good set of teeth.

The P> members of the Prendergast Labor
Ministry (Vic.) are all Australian natives.
’ later, the Attorney-General, is senior vice-
president of the A.N.A., and Lemmon (Edu-
cation) is on the executive. The team is
the strongest the party could yield, and the
exhaustive ballot selection was probably
better than Prendergast’s would have been
had it been left to him. Tunnecliffe is well
placed as Chief Sec.. Bailey as Lands Min-
lster, Hogan as Railway and Agricultural
Minister, Jones as Health Minister, and
McNamara can do all that is necessary at
the Mines and Forests Departments. Cain
and Webber, the two Assembly lionoraries,
will be helpful in Cabinet, and Beckett and
Disney will not be passengers. Jones,
Beckett and Disney sit behind considerable
wealth, particularly .Jones, who is an “intel-
lectual socialist.”
There are but four survivors of Victoria’s
only previous Labor Ministry—it held office
lor 13 days in 1913. Prendergast was Chief
Sec.; J. W. Billson, Minister for Railways;
J. Lemmon, Minister of Education and
Labor; and J. I*. Jones, Hon. Minister.
Frank Hourigan, who died at Adelaide a
tew days ago, was one of s earliest
and most brilliant reps, in the S.A. Assem-
bly- He was a pugnacious single-taxer,
and this, with some other more amiable
weaknesses, induced the party to hold an
undated signed resignation over his massive
head. After he left politics. Hourigan took
a sequestered billet in the Railway Depart-
ment and was almost forgotten till at 68, in
disregard of departmental precedent and
medical wisdom, he sprinted to catch a train,
and heart failure caught him first.

Labor Cabinet, Attorney-General Slater is
the only ’Varsity graduate; but Jones
(Works and Health) and Lemmon (Educa-
tion and Labor) take so much interest in
higher education that they are Government
representatives on the ’Varsity Council. The
Ministry comprises two tailors, a bootmaker,
u printer, a lawyer, a lawyer’s clerk, a
farmer, a couple of industrials or A.L.P.
secretaries, a furniture and an ex-furniture
dealer, a clerk (who has also been a handy
man), and a Whip who is or has been a
butcher. Tunnecliffe in his spare time has
written verse as well as pretty good prose.
Recently deceased Graeme Balsillie, first
Commonwealth Radio Engineer, had an in-
ventive mind. He worked out an original
scheme of connections for wireless which in
no way infringed any existing patents, and
sold it to the Government. He then turned
his. attention to telegraphing without an
aerial, and actually succeeded in sending read-
able signals across Bass Strait. Rain-making
by wireless was his pet hobby, but in this he
failed to make good, although given a gener-
ous allowance by the Government to cover
the cost of experiments in inland Australia.
He was engaged in America in placing a
Patent for a unique reflector for motor-car
lights when his spark was quenched.
Poor old W. H. Story, ex-M.H.R. for
Boothby (S.A.), who died the other day, be-
gan to fade away after he was beaten at the
last election. To him the House was another
home where he could have a quiet drink,
toast his feet over the fire, or meet some
of his old Labor friends in a game of cards.
NED HOGAN
(Warrenheip ),
Vic.’s Labor
Minister of
Agriculture
and Railways.
He rarely made a speech, but when he got
up on one of the few subjects that were
near his heart, his pellucid diction struck
strangely on an ear more accustomed to gruff
language from men of his age. He was sin-
gularly quiet outside, and the only time a
colleague ever heard his voice raised in ex-
citement was during an unexpected call for
a division one night when he was playing
poker. The other players quietly turned their
hands down on the table and went out to
do their duty. Story apologised for putting
his lot in his pocket. He couldn’t bear to
part with four kings and an ace, which he
produced as if they were the Crown jewels
when the game was eventually resumed.
•T. H. Thompson, one of the first agents
The Bulletin had in Queensland and a
staunch friend of the paper for over 40
years, died last week, aged 78. A few days
previously cancer had been definitely diag-
nosed, after an X-ray examination. He was
offered the alternative—a few months’ suffer-
ing and a very doubtful operation. He did
not expect to come through the operation
—which had to be performed with local
anaesthetics only—and he passed away under
it. His wife died 22 years ago.
Norman Haire, the young Sydney doctor
who has become the foremost London dis-
ciple of Steinach, has put his ideas on re-
juvenation into a book, now ready for issue.
He spent some time in the Viennese special-
ist’s laboratory last March. Ilaire lias
operated on about 80 cases in Harley-street,
where his plate is displayed. Some of the
results were “miraculous,” but Haire doesn’t
describe the treatment (which has nothing
to do with monkey glands) as a cure-all.
His best tribute came from a Scandinavian
film co., which recently sent an expert to
London to propose a film (presumably show-
ing “Befoi’e” and “After”), offering a big
lump sum and royalties. Medical etiquette,
of course, forbade acceptance. One of
Haire’s greatest successes is a well-known
novelist.
A. G. Ralston and David Maughan. who
have been made acting-Supreme Court judges
in N. S. Wales, are descendants of a long
line of Australian legal men. A cousinly
relationship connects them both with the
Windeyer family—-Charles Windeyer, the
founder of his tribe, was their great-grand-
parent. Coming to N. S. Wales in 1828,
Charles Windeyer intended settling on the
land; but a century ago there was a shortage
of legal men, so, knowing' something of law,
he obliged Governor Darling by mounting
the bench of the Sydney Police Court. A
few years later his son Richard, a barrister,
came to Australia and quickly established
himself as a legal lion. When the first Re-
presentative Parliament was established, in
1843, he was one of 24 members elected by
the people, and proved a thorn in the flesh of
Governor Gipps through his radical opposition
to the Government’s 12 nominee members.
Incidentally, he used to scandalise folk by
shaking hands with his convict servants anil
paying them wages. He died 11 years after
his arrival at Sydney. Richard’s only son
was William Charles, who became a judge.
Ralston married his own cousin. Justice
Windeyer’s daughter, and Maughan’s wife is
a daughter of the late Toby Barton.
A variegated life ended with the death of
Allen Martin in Adelaide. Born in Eng-
land, he first earned a crust as a school-
teacher, then signed on before the mast in one
of Soames Brothers’ sailing-vessels which
traded to Australia, and after seven years—
he was then mate—settled in Sydney. The
Gympie gold diggings called him, ' but no
fortune awaited him there, so he worked his
way around to Port Adelaide, where he
labored on the wharves. In 1870 he opened
the Port Adelaide Grammar School, and,
when it was taken over by the Govern-
ment some years later, he continued as head-
master. In 1900 he was given the job of
inspector, and held it for 15 years. Then he
retired from the service and joined his sons
in a motor business at Port Adelaide, where
he toiled until the end came at 80.
A fine old-fashioned gentleman was Hugh
Lavery, over whom a mound has been heaped
at Geelong. For years he was assistant
Surveyor-General of Vic., and the younger
generation remember him as one who, no
matter how busy, always had time for help-
ful suggestion and an encouraging word. He
died at Rose Bay, Sydney, and, in compliance
with his wishes, the body was taken back to
Geelong.
“Rounds”: Little Ernie Farrar, just back
from England, has a greater idea of the im-
portance of being Ernest than most of his
old N.S.W. Trades Hall acquaintances. He
was sec. of the Saddlers’ Union, and, as its
representative on the Labor Council, had
climbed into the presidential chair when
Labor was in power in N. S. Wales. Hol-
man, looking for party men who would be
grateful for favors received, included him in
a group of Laborites he made M’s.L.C. Offi-
cially there is no payment of members in the
Uppish House, but Farrar and those
appointed with him have managed to live
without regular outside toil—Works Com-
imttee fees are one solution of their financial
problem. I rank Bryant is a member of the
Water and Sewerage Board, Teddy Kav-
anagh a member of the Board of Trade, and
his job as Minister for Labor Keeps Farrar
going.
“Old Parliamentary Hand’s” verdict:—
Of the Ministers who retired with Peacock the
one apart from the head who most impressed ns
was Argyle. He got a good grip of administrative
work in the Chief See.’s Department, and had a fine
conception of the duties of a Minister. As McPher-
son soon found, the doctor was no mere polish
on the Cabinet, hut master of his own section.
Three months ago he was regarded as a possible
Premier, but his virile campaign work made him
unpopular with the small men and aroused the
jealousy of old hands who never had a taste of
office. In 10 months Argyle was in three Cabinets
—the second and third Lawson and the third Pea-
cock teams.
One of Monash’s young men, John A.
Laing, cast a supervising eye on the hand-
some new bridge over the Yarra at Church-
street, Richmond. He is an M.C.E. of Mel-
bourne and bagged a lot of scholarships there
about 16 years ago. All his practical experi-
ence, however, he received with Monash,
whom he succeeded as specialist lecturer at
the Uni. on reinforced-concrete construction.
The P’ran Council agreed to co-operate in the
erection of the bridge only on the under-
that Laing should prepare the
engineering plans and supervise the construc-
tion. Just turned 40, the young Victorian
looks' like challenging Bradfield. of Sydney,
as the Commonwealth specialist in bridge-
building. He should be well in the running
for the control of the projected Spencer-street
bridge—if it isn’t delayed beyond his life-
time.
Victoria lost an old-established Jesuit re-
cently when Denis Manning reported to
Ignatius Loyola. A Kerry man, he joined
up with the S. .1. Society in 1867, came to
Australia in the late ’eighties, was attached
to the teaching staff of St. Ignatius’ at River-
view (Sydney), where he imparted classical
knowledge to most of the leading Catholic
laymen of N.S.W., and thence went to
Xavier College, Kew (Vic.)—so tb the finish
at 77.
When he is not looking after the Arctic
Stefansson sometimes interests himself in
spiritualism. In his latest book on the cult
“Our American Adventure,” Conan Doyle
mentions two sittings with mediums in New
York to which he went with Stefansson In
the first case they ran up against what Doyle
describes as a fraud; in the second the “con-
trol” was an Indian who had lived near Fort
Garry, now Winnipeg, where Stefansson was

born. But as the Indian had passed over in
3876 and Stefansson was not born till 187!>
the statements of Black Hawk about persons
and events at Fort Garry had to be taken on
trust.
Memories of the exploring days were re-
vived along the Riverina recently when
grazier Henry Angel left for the place where
the other angels live. His father was with
Hume and Ilovell on their great overland trip
to Port Phillip (Vic.), which incidentally
put the Murrumbidgeo and the Murray oil
the map. Angel, sen., claimed to be the
first white man to swim across the latter
streak of wet. In 1845 the family settled near
Hay (N.S.W.), but when the just-dead
grazier s first wife died he moved on to Lake
Albert, where he married the widow of a
settler named Fitzgerald. He was 87 when
the day closed at Wagga.
Thomas Armson, who died last week at
Young (N. S. Wales), claimed to have been

Saville called it a day at Casino. An Eng-

retiring to Casino 20 years ago. The veteran,
who finished at 98, had 17 children, and the

children and 76 great-grandchildren. His

■She waits for the tram in the early morn,
A lone old woman, in garments worn,
Washing and cleaning by the day—
A sorrowful end for Kate O’Shea!
In her old bonnet of rusty black,
M ith a bit of a veil pinned on the back,
’Mid ribbons faded and tips uncurled
A red, red rose nods at the world.
Of youth and-laughter and love it speaks—
Once she’d the like in her lips and cheeks;
But Sorrow plucked them this many a day,
For his hand fell hard upon Kate O’Shea.
Weary hours of rub, rub, rub—
Small wonder that ghosts conic round the tub!
The lad she loved, the men she bred—
She lives with the absent and the dead!
For the only place she has to call
Her own, her home, is a stuffy, small
Back room in somebody rise’s house,
And she’s as poor as the poor church mouse.
But still, though sore by the years beset,
There s good, red blood in her old heart vet,
And the rose held high to the world can say:

A PROBLEM SOLVED.
POET (in despair): “Wife, the wolf is at the door. What shall
we do?”
WIFE: “Shh! Go down the first floor, lasso him with your belt,
and we’ll cook him for tea.”
“Moc”: Several incidents stick in my mind
as contradictions to the assertion that there is no
intentional cruelty in the New Guinea native (B.
26/6/’24). For instance, in a village on the
Mandated Territory coast, I saw a small crowd
and heard agonised yelps coming from its midst.
Investigating, I found that the attraction was a
mangy dog with two broken forepaws. One native
was applying a burning stick to its nose, ears and
paws, the tortured animal’s frantic cries and efforts
to dodge the brand being productive of much merri-
ment in the crowd. When I stopped the fun it was
explained to me in all seriousness that the dog was
of no use whatever, one paw having been broken
accidentally, which had led its owner to break the
other in the interests of entertainment for himself
and his friends. The ultimate test of intentional
cruelty is whether pleasure is derived from the
infliction of pain or the sight of suffering, and in
this particular case there could be no doubt that
that was what was happening.

“Moce” : Re dogfights and feats of strength.
Recently while I was discussing with a gang of
Fijian labor the blessings accruing from hard work,
Roko, who follows me around the plantation, had a
difference of opinion with two Fijian dogs. Though
seriously hampered in the rear he acquitted himself
well in the scrap, and he got a stranglehold on his
larger opponent’s throat which gave promise of an
early reduction in the odds against him. At this
point, however, the Fijian owner of the big dog
seized his property by the tail and in an effort to
separate the contestants flung the struggling mass
from him. The three dogs, locked together, landed
still in that condition, and the throw was a matter
of 25 feet. Two days later, having seen the smallest
of the three dogs turn the scales at 211 b., and eager
to confirm the evidence of my own eyes, I persuaded
the same Iviviti to try his hand on a 601 b. bag of
rice. His best attempt was 29ft.

“Old Timer”: A perfect Australian gentle-
man (B. 19/6/’24) is also found here in the scrub
at Dorrigo (N.S.W.), but he resembles the blue
’possum that is slaughtered every winter for its
skin. My little gent, was discovered in the pocket
of a vest which was hanging on a fence. I trans-
ferred him and the garment to the kitchen, and every
night, the tiny creature found the sugar and dined.
After that he would scamper round for a while before
returning to the pocket. He disappeared after six
months. We blamed the cat, who, being a lady, iiad
not the instincts of a gentleman.
* * * *
“F.J.S.”: I cau’t agree with “Cartot.” (B.
27/3/’24) that malaria is a comparatively ne>v
complaint, in New Guinea and New Britain. In my
three years of plantation work in the Rabaul,
Kaiwieng and Manus districts, I have come across
only about 15 cases of malarial fever among the
native laborers out of the several hundreds of sick
cases treated. The natives have several cures for
malaria, including Tamorine’s herb brew and a
brew of the grated bark of the mango-tree; and
the fact that there are a number of native cures
should be sufficient proof that it is an old-estab-
lished sickness. I think that the enlarged-spleen
appearance described by “Oartot” is due to the con-
tinuous diet of the tasteless and highly-indigestible
taro on which the natives in the Bainings and hinter-
land of New Guinea exist. As to the remark that
coastal village piccaninnies suffer largely from the
enlarged spleen, my experience is that coastal natives,
whether small or large, are of far better average
physique than bush nigs. I have seen inland boys
in Kaiwieng district with slim waists which would
have made the ex-Crown Prince go green with envy.

“X2X”: Our marsupials often suffer from
an epidemic disease the causatory organism of which
has not yet been isolated, probably because it be-
longs to the class of filter-passers. It was not
known until a short
time ago, however,
that the infection could
be transmitted to
human beings. The first
case in which this hap-
pened occurred in West-
ralia, a black gin be-
ing the victim. The
’roos in the district
had been suffering
from the complaint for
some months, the
symptoms consisting of
a paralysis of the hind-
quarters, a discharge
from eyes, nose and
mouth, with ulcerated
patches on the body,
and finally a state of un-
consciousness rapidly
ending in death. The
gin drank from a
waterhole which the in-
fected animals fre-
quented, and within a
few hours she developed
symptoms very like
those in the marsu-
pials, with the addi-
tion of others some-
what resembling teta-
nus. Her death was
preceded by delirium,
foaming at the mouth
and a swelling of necit
and jaws. Another
characteristic was the
rapid decomposition that took place. The body was
not examined baeteriologicallv, because of the re-
moteness of the spot where the case occurred, and so
nothing was learned as to the course of the disease
in human beings. It is not known whether it is
possible for stock to acquire the infection ; but the
question is one that is well worth looking into.
* * * *
“Saaedi”: “Arnapu” mentions a lawsuit in
Maoriland arising from ewes described as four-tooth
having their fifth and sixth teeth appearing through
the gums at the time of sale (B. 19/6/’24). In Aus-
tralia such sheep would be described as rising six-
tooth, by which would be understood an age some-
where in the vicinity of three years. No hard and
fast rule can be laid down as to the exact age in
months when a sheep will get any particular set
of teeth. A harder thing to define than the usual
two-, four-, six- and eight-tooth terms is the title
“hogget.” The moment lambs are taken from their
mothers they are known as weaners, and a few
months later as hoggets; but as to the precise age
at which they are to be described by the latter term
there is no agreement. Moreover, as the two teeth
appear in some sheep at 13 months, and in some
not till 16 or 17, the age at which they cease to
be hoggets isn’t clear either. But it is in rela-
tion to sheep described as “sound mouth” that the
THEY ADMINISTERED AN ANESTHETIC.
THE MAGISTRATE : “ Don’t you think it a cruel thing to have robbed a man like this?”
THE THUG: “Well, yer Washup, ’e was unconscious at the time. We 'it ’im on the
’cad first.”
greatest difficulty occurs. The teeth of sheep only
four years old will often present a disreputable
appearance if the jumbucks have been fed much on
scrub or hard dry feed, or pastured in stony coun-
try-, while ancients of seven and eight years will often
exhibit excellent molars. To make matters worse,
some sheepmen (usually in the capacity of buyers)
will declare a sheep’s mouth unsound if the teeth
are worn or separated in the slightest degree, while
others (usually in the capacity of sellers) have ex-
tremely generous views on the subject.
“VL7”; The hoary old problem as to when
a four-tooth becomes a six-tooth has done a good
deal to enrich the lawyers, and is the outcome of a
clumsy system. By describing the animals as, say,
“May-June drop” or “June-July drop” we get at
the precise age. The buyer can still check the age
in a “near enough” way, by examining the month
—unless he is like the newchum who bought a lot
of gummy ewes as lambs. Another method of fat-
tening the lawyers is by using the words “in lamb”
in a sale note. If it means anything it means
100 p.c. drop. One buyer claimed this, and judge,
lawyers, barristers and 32 witnesses spent eight
days threshing the thing out. Why not say so
many per cent, rams joined on such a date? So
with the term “more or less” in regard to sale
stock. The meaning of this phrase has never been
decided, though the Courts have wrangled over it
for many years.
* * * *
“Hayband”: I agree with “John Welling-
ton” (B. 29/5/’24) that J. D. Ewes is off the track
in his book “China, Australia and the Pacific
Islands” when he states that the ancient Maori
forced stones down the necks of the infants at bap-
tism. In Taylor’s book, “New Zealand” (really a
first-hand account of Maori beliefs and customs), he
describes the baptism as follows:
On the eighth day after birth the ceremony was
performed at the side of a stream. A native priest
sprinkled the child with a twig, or branch, when
the little one was not immersed. The priest kept
calling over the names of its ancestors until at last
the child sneezed. That was its name, thus chosen
by the child itself, or the ancestral spirit manifest
through it.
I have never seen a statement of Taylor’s questioned.
* * * *
“Morinda”: “D.II.R.’s” par. (B. 5/6/’24)
re Papuan and Gyppo natives burying spears, cook-
ing utensils, etc., with their dead reminds me that
about four years ago at Abua, Papua, a white
trader ended his own life while delirious with
malaria, and his native boys buried him and re-
ported the matter to the Government. The District
Magistrate arrived some days later and, exhuming
the body, found that all the dead man’s personal
belongings, including a cup and saucer, plate, knife
and fork, had been buried with him.
* * -* *
“FY7” : I fancy that “Larry Longun” is
in error himself when he says (B. 26/6/’24) that he
has seen flocks of 50 spoonbills feeding on lucerne
flats “a mile from the nearest water.” The odds are
heavy that the birds he saw were white ibis. These
are great pasture-feeders, like their parti -colored
brothers, and their fondness for the wire-worm makes
them invaluable to farmers. The spoonbill, in my
experience, is at least a semi-solitary bird. Further,
his beak, tipped with circular paddle blades and
fitted with strainers, is essentially a tool for feeding
in wet and swampy ground. The bird paddles the
ooze and drains off the water through the strainers,
retaining small crustaceans, insects, etc. His bill
could not pierce ordinary soil.
“Pantagruel”: I agree with “Yardley” (B.
19/6/'24) concerning the durable and artistic quali-
ties of Queensland cedar. His 30-years-old mantel-
piece which still remains sound is surpassed by a
cedar screen standing in the doorway of a Rockhamp-
ton (C.Q.) auctioneer’s rooms. It is nearly 60 years
old, and shows no sign of decay, incidentally, cedar
stocks in Queensland are very low. The cedar twig-
borer pest is rampant, and the Eungella Plateau in
the North is the only place still containing red cedar
supplies; and, what’s more, it is the only place
capable of producing fresh stocks, the other districts
being ravaged by the borer. Experiments are being
made on the Q. forestry stations with Gedrela odoratu,
an imported cedar which has so far been unaffected
by the twig-borer, and if successful new forests
of it will be laid out.
■*'***
“Old Timer”: “Sol’s” picture of the New
Chums on the Land (B. 22/5/’24) reminds me that
34 years ago a newly-arrived Scotchman bought a
mare from my father and took her to Penrose, on
the Southern line (N.S.W.). In the daytime, when
he wasn’t using her, he would take her into the
dense bush, tie her to a tree, hobble her and put a
bell on her; and at night she was given a dipper of
bran and stabled. She soon died. Then Scotty said
he was taken down at his first horse deal in this
cursed country. There are people still living at
Penrose who can vouch for this.
* * * *
“Chiron”: Someone was worried awhile
ago as to how a snake backs out of a hole, the idea
being that his scales prevent his retreat. They don't.
When the hole is so small that the wriggler can’t
turn his head and slide out right end first he simply
turns his scales. That sounds so simple to me that I
wonder no one has suggested it before. Anyhow,
I’ve got a momento to say I’m right; but I can’t
enclose it.

“D.M.1.”: I came upon an interesting relic
recently while horse-hunting along the Flinders (Q.).
It was a heap of old shear-blades about, 4ft. high,
not far from the site of the old Manfred Downs
woolshed. This shed and Northampton Downs share
the honor of being the first in Queensland to shear
with machines. The Manfred shed was perhaps the
most up-to-date when it occupied its old position on
THE WINE LIST.
a ridge overlooking the Flinders. The, uprights were
Sin. bore casing and the materials used ip its con-
struction were all carted by teams from Normanton
The first machine shearing on Manfred took four
months to put through, as the barbers had to learn
to shear all over again. Not one of the original
team stayed till the cut-out—one by one they left
in disgust, declaring that the next year would see
the blades doing duty again.

THE WONDER-WIND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As 1 wandered, craving rest,
Peace of heart and mind,
From the red heart of the West
Came a wonder-wind.
“Trouble not,” it said, “nor fret;
Worry waits on men;
Age forget and care forget—
Be a boy again.”
Tales it told of route and track,
Camp and river-arm;
“Come,” it said, “I’ll send you back,
Back to Perry’s farm.”
Out of town and west away,
Counselled by that wind,
Went I at the end of day,
Leaving ills behind.
Perry’s farm —it lay beneath,
Housing homely folk ;
Over it curled wreath and wreath
Of blue chimney-smoke.
There stood Perry and his dame
At their open door,
Farm and folk were just the same
As they were of yore.
“Trouble not,” they cried, “nor fret;
Sit you down,” and then—
“ Care forget and age forget,
Be a boy again. ”
Wood upon the fire they threw,
Close they shut the door;
Warm of hand and heart I grew,
Meeting them once more.
Thus I sat with friends about.
Mind and heart at rest,
Till the wonder-wind died out
In the greying west.
Fancies fail and visions pass,
Dreams unreal grow....
Perry and his dame, alas,
Died long years ago.

MOTOR TYRES
Australasian Requirements
“The road conditions in Australia call for
tyres specially constructed with a view of
withstanding the rough surface, stones, etc.,
incidental to the average roads and tracks
in this country. The Dunlop Rubber Co. of
Aust. Ltd. has for over 20 years studied the
requirements in this direction —and the re-
sult to-day is that Dunlop motor tyres are
everywhere recognised and appreciated by
motorists as being supreme for wear,
economy and comfort. They combine the
essentials—great strength, extra thickness
of wearing surfaces, and highest quality of
materials and workmanship, thereby ensuring users
wonderful mileage and freedom from trouble. The
demand for Australian “Dunlops” is such that the
extensive plant of the Dunlop Co. (the largest in
the Southern Hemisphere) is being continually ex-
tended to cope with the insistent call for more
“Dunlops.” The Dunlop policy of building many
thousands of miles of service into every cover and
tube made—is appreciated by tens of thousands of
motorists in this country. There is no doubt Aus-
tralian motorists can with profit support this great
Australian industry, and thereby ensure further
employment to Australian workers. It it well worth
remembering that the initial cost of “Dunlops” is
less than imported tyres—and as they deliver road
service equal to any tyre in the world—the result
is a lower running cost than if other tyres are used.
The company guarantees satisfaction—and adjusts
claims on a 5000 miles basis.”

“F. Clinton”: Starving sheep brought by
rail from dought-strieken areas to the Monaro
(N.S.W.) seem particularly liable to disease. It
seems that their vitality has been so lowered by
privation that immediately they start on green
feed they are attacked by one complaint or another.
“Pink eye,” with its resultant blindness, is one of
the commonest troubles, and once they contract this
THE WAY OF THE TABERNACLE.
INCUMBENT: “We must get up a bazaar to pay off those bills.”
WARDEN ( surprised ): “Bills!—what are they forf”
INCUMBENT: “Well, you know, we've never paid for the social we had to celebrate the
church being at last happily free from debt.”
they are an easy prey for the crows. Sheep-fly plays
havoc with them ; and if placed on soft, moist coun-
try, footrot puts in an appearance. Sheep which are
driven from the plains to the uplands instead of be-
ing railed develop greater resistance. Evidently the
gradual change from drought-stricken fields over
increasingly better-grassed areas until they reach the
tablelands’ rich pastures progressively hardens them
to a point at which disease has difficulty in finding
a lodgment.
* * * *
“Rahoriki” (M.L.) : The theory of the
Spanish origin of the Maori’s black-and-white tyke,
as propounded by “VeronaT’ recently,
does not seem tenable. The kuri was
not wild; he was a domesticated
Towser, highly prized as a smell-dog
for ground game, as kai and as a
fur coat. He figures in many ancient
traditions—in fact, Ina Waru, of
Hawaiki, was the first kuri, having
been turned dog by Maui, the chap
who fished Maoriland up from the
sea. There was a kuri with the
Maori Noah, Tipu, and a particular
breed, kuri mahorangi, came to
Maoriland with the last fleet, about
a.d. 1300 ; but perhaps the Spaniards
were here before that. Perhaps the
kuri isn’t indigenous; but, then,
neither is Hori, though he has been
here quite a while, and so, too, has
his pero. It is not unlikely that the
Maori adopted the word “pero” from
the early Spanish navigators, but I
don’t think he pinched their dog. As
to “poaka”—not “porka”—Williams’s
-Dictionary says; “Cook relates that
the Maoris in conversation mentioned
the pig, not by description, but by
name, that they called it booah
( puaa ), which, he says, was the same
as the name he had heard in the South
Sea Islands” (Voyages, ed. 1793, Vol.
11, p. 372). The word “puaa” has
been entirely displaced by the imported
poaka (porker), which has been erro-
neously supposed to be connected with
the Word puaa. Evidently, though the
Maori was out of pigs when Cook
came, he had traditional knowledge
of them.
“Milburn”: Re “Herodot” (B. 19/8/’24)
on goanna fat. Quite a lot of cookies up here in
Queensland consider it a sovereign remedy for mam-
mitis in cows, and I know of cases where a cure has
been effected; yet no one would suspect Strawberry
of having any beforehand belief in a cure. Incidentally,
some people assert that the smellful stuff is no good
for rheumatism, because it is claimed to have a
softening effect, on bone. Judging by the way it
gets through a glass bottle I am inclined to think
there is something in that too.
* * * *
“Borom”: Several months ago the birds
in the country around the Guy Fawkes Ranges
(N.S.W.) were attacked by some obviously bacterial,
disease which slew thousands before it had run its
course. There were no external manifestations of
the epidemic, except in some eases a slight pus-
like discharge about the beak. Apparently the virus
was powerful, for some of its victims dropped while
in flight and died within a few minutes. So far as is
known no other creatures were affected by it, and
the epidemic seems to have been restricted to the
district between the main Northern and North Coast
railway lines. Outbreaks of this kind are not un-
common m the bush, and they are responsible for
some terrific holocausts among the fauna of the coun-
try, though generally they pass unnoticed outside
the areas in which they actually occur. It is diffi-
cult to say whence most of them come, but the
chances are that in a case like the Guy Fawkes out-
break the trouble was introduced by some migrating
warblers, probably from Asia, where many bacterial
diseases among birds and animals exist in endemic
form.
* * * *
“Azac”: Tell “Ragar” (B. 26/6/’24) that
the biscuit-colored, luminous fungus which he found
growing on the semi-rotten stump near Brookvale
(N.S.W.) is most unlikely to be edible. Although
he was not very detailed in his description, yet it
is probable that he found one of the species of Agari-
cus. There are many species of the Agaricus tribe,
but only four are luminous— Agaricus olearius, A.
igneus, A. noctilencus and A. gardneri. None of
these luminous species can be eaten, but about 80
other species of Agaricus are edible. There may be
some obscure (or unknown) species of N.S.W. fungi
that are luminous and at the same time edible, but
“Ragar” will be well advised to fight shy of food-
stuffs that go to the trouble to advertise themselves
by luminous signs on dark nights. It simply isn’t
Nature’s way of doing things.
* * * *
“Tang-alolii” : Re long rides on horseback.
In 1899 I was living just 20 miles from a country
town in N.S.W. when one of my children became ill.
I rode in the dark to the town in one hour, left my
prad at the doctor’s gate for the 20 minutes it took
to get advice and .medicine, and then rode back home
in another hour. The little mare, that carried me
I had brought from N. Queensland a few months
before, and she was only grass fed. She was about
13 hands, and I was about 13 stone.
* * * *
“E.D.C.”: “Ragar” mentions a snake at-
tempting to strike him in winter (B. 26/6/’24), and
says it is the only occasion he knows of that one has
been sufficiently awake at this time of year to try
it. In July, 1914, I was driving some cattle across
a big red ridge in the Moree (N.S.W.) district,
when my mare shied violently at a big black chap
who was enjoying the sun. He took no notice of
us until I made a miss-hit with my stockwhip. This
woke him up all right, and he made a desperate leap
at the mare, who sidestepped beautifully. I made
no mistake next hit, and put him permanently to
sleep. Incidentally, this encounter convinced me
that a snake can spring forward, and it was only
the mare’s agility that saved me a 10-mile walk.
* * * *
“Jacky Roo”: Mention by “Lily-Beale”
(B. 3/7/’24) of pink-eye in sheep moves me to ask
why the disease was ever called that when the
eye invariably turns blue. By the same token, a
certain cure is to doctor the affected eye with
powdered brown sugar.
* * * *
“Capta” : “Cbhota Peg” (B. 26/6/’24) has
it right when he reckons a racial war has been
declared between our native birds and the louse-
infested starling. The kookaburras are probably the
kingpins in the big stoush, with Maggie on the
right flank, while our backyard ducks are the
Portuguese of the turnout. Some time ago I heard
a rumpus in the yard and got out in time to see
two ducks having a tug-of-war with a starling as
the rope. The stronger duck got away with the
prisoner and proceeded to rattle him up and down
violently, using the poor pommy’s head as a handle.
Hemmed in, pecked and dragged at, there was only
one thing for Lousy to do. He did it—he died!*
“W.A.G.”: Has the Council anything to
beat this carrot? It was grown at Hazelhurst, near
Marton (M.L.), weighs 151 b., is lft. lOin. long and
has a circumference of ‘26tin.
“Te Whare” : Although the bird is said to
be common in most parts of the country, I have
only once come across the singing honey-eater
{Ptilotis sonora) on Monaro (N.S.W.) highlands. The
call is a full, liquid, sonorous note, which can be
heard at a considerable distance. The general
coloring is brown with yellow ear patches and a
grey breast finely lined with black. The familiar
green-back, or white-eared honey-eater (Ptilotis
leucotis ), is of the same breed. This bird builds a
neat cup-nest, cosily lined with fine cow- or horse-
hair, or sometimes ’possum or wallaby fur, v'hile the
noisy New Holland honey-eater prefers as upholstery
the soft velvety material gathered from certain
ferns. Some of the smaller cuckoos often favor the
green-back as a foster parent, as it is mainly insect-
ivorous in habit, and occasional doses of so-called
honey (nectar of flowers) won’t harm a young cuckoo.
I have seen a greenback chase a bronzewing cuckoo
away from its nest and roll tbe parasite over in the
dust. This bird also emits a loud, ringing call-note
resembling that of the yellow-tufted honey-eater,
a more ornately plumaged variety. Both species are
common and of wide range.
* * * *
“L’Fou” : Some data for the Council. The
flock consisted of four white leghorn hens, one
white leghorn rooster and a dozen black Orping-
ton hens running at large. Wanting purebred
chickens I set some white leghorn eggs, easily iden-
tifiable from those of the brown-shelled orps.
Result: Fertility, nil. Noting that Ohanticler was
attracted by the ladies of opposite hue to himself,
I set some black orp. eggs. Fertility, 90 per cent.
I tried the experiment over next season, with a pure
black orp. rooster, six black orp. hens and the same
number of white leghorns. Result: From a dozen
black orp. eggs, two chicks; from a dozen white
leghorn eggs, 11 chicks.
“Trevdee”: A Wimmera (Vie.) farmer
went after quail recently. The birds were wild, so
he began shooting at anything, and finished with
1 teal, 2 black ducks, 5 quail, 1 rabbit, 2 hares, 3
parrots, 8 crows, 1 fox, 2 water-hens, 1 coot, 16
sparrows and 1 wood duck. As he was out for only
an hour, and used No. 10 shot throughout, the
variety of bag must be a record.
“Gouger”: Recent reference to niggers
camouflaging their heads with reeds when catching
wild ducks recalls the haul made by one ingenious
tribe up here on Cape York Peninsula (Q.) when a
flooded river washed many wild pie-melons into an
adjacent lagoon. The ducks quickly became accus-
tomed to the water-logged melons floating about, so
the niggers collected half a dozen of the largest
vegetables, scraped the insides out, cut tiny eyeslits,
put the shells over their heads, waded into the reeds,
then very slowly made their way right in among the
guileless ducks. The rest was simple. But it was a
discharged police-boy from Cooktown who made his
name ring throughout the coastal tribes as a marvel
man. This inventor’s method was to bait a white-
man’s fish-hook with the slushy green stuff wild ducks
love, pick a suitable possy in the reeds, throw the
sinkerless line well out through the reeds, then pull
it gently in. Almost invariably some silly duck
would dive for the morsel. So widely did the fame
of, this wonder-man spread that a witch-doctor
poisoned him.
* * * *
“Pinnacle”: A neighbor of mine while
working cattle had w'orn the , horsehair cracker on
his whip back to the knot. A beast broke, and as
he raced to turn it he made a mighty chop with
the whip. Simultaneously with the crack he felt a

burning pain over his heart. He thought he had
been struck by a spent bullet, and on investigation
found a hole about the size of a .22 bullet through
his waistcoat, shirt and singlet, and a red scar where
the skin was just broken. No bullet was found, but
the knot of horsehair was just below the mark.
THE FALL OF McGINNIS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Miss Mary Jane McGinnis was the pride of Toolev-
bar;
She could run, and she could wrestle, and was clever
in a spar;
She was rather good to look upon, and, fierce as
she might be,
She had caught the wayward fancy of voung Tim
Maeonnochie.
But Tim was a flirtatious bloke; his fondness going
astray,
He looked with an admiring glance on little Annie
Hay.
Athletic Miss McGinnis took exception to the fact,
And Miss Hay was promptly waited on and com-
petently smacked.
Then Tim took up with Chrissie Smith, and Marv
called her out,
And Chrissie in the contest was knocked shamefully
about.
Miss McGinnis fought her rivals in a pugilistic style,
W ith a clever show of footwork and much scientific
guile.
She went for Jessie Thornton on whom Tim had east
his eyes,
And bruised her lip, and swelled her nose to twice
its normal size.
As Tim was very popular, owned cows and verdant,
lands,
Miss Mary had a quantity of trouble on her hanls.
The maidens of the district got together one fine
night,
And resolved on certain measures the McGinnis girl
to spite ;
And presently to Tooleybar came Miss .Rebecca
Jones,
Who had rather pleasing features, but was just a
bag of bones.
She at the dairy picnic was monopolising Tim —
Her goo-goo eyes and vamping ways had fairly flum-
moxed him—
When. Mary rose majestical, with energy and grace,
And waded in and soundly smacked Rebecca Jones’s
face.
What followed roused keen interest, and everybody
swears
’Twas the liveliest picnic they had had for “quite
a mort o’ years.”
For Rebecca sailed in gaily, and she boxed poor
Mary’s ears,
And slapped her cheeks, and all the girls encouraged
her with cheers.
Rebecca had more science than poor Mary, and she
teased
Her opponent to confusion, and she smacked her as
she pleased.
Her headwork was perfection. She evaded Mary's
blows,
And concentrated steadily upon that lady’s nose.
AFTER SIX.
“ Gaan’t get the old bottle in pocket, maate.”
“ Caan't ’ec! Well, drink drop av un and then try again.”
Miss Mary Jane was very game, and stuck it quite
a while,
But presently she gave a scream and went down in
a pile.
In tearful words of hatred she abandoned handsome
Jim,
And the Jones girl put her hat on and went trapesing
off with him.
Miss Jones she went from Tooleybar by river boat
next day,
And discarded wig and petticoats before she steamed
away.
But this bit of information broken-hearted Mary
missed—
She had fought and lost a battle with a budding
pugilist.

SILK GLOVES
M-Kr.r^ 1 J“ a TT cast as the unfortunate
Maggie Faust, Her Majesty’s was a brim-
xng beaker for the management on the
opening night of Gounod’s work. The circle
«w«o Stalls f we , r ? upholstered with the most
swagger frocking of the season. Lady
Sf® Kous, in Mrs. Tony Hordern’s box,
ll , c F. s , llvei ; brocades in a wrap of
ermine, while her hostess demonstrated what
a whoie cape of the elusive pelts could look
™ "- n ?ther wearer of the furry aristocrat
was baritone Maguenat’s wife. Toti Dal
Monte and the beauteous Scavizzi nested in
l Tait box The G.-G.’s lady turned
on a clear-cut profile and silver and green
brocades, while the grey and silver frocking
f her guest. Miss Carleton, conveyed a cer-
S ty Heaven sufficient to confound a
dozen Meplustos. Commander Grant’s wife
was a rosebud in pink georgettes.
faPrv uight Melba, having renounced
the Devil and all his works, was boxed with a
clear conscience with Lady Helena Rous
and Prince Obolensky to watch “Pagliacci”
and Cavalleria Rusticana.” Scavizzi made
a stunning Santuzza in “Cavalleria,” and
gracetul little Aurora Rettore a bewitching
JNedda. City Coroner Jamieson was a
prominent front-staller. Lady Forster
tering like a Lorelei, brought Mrs. ’ Pitt
Rivers in rosy brocades and Miss Carleton in
bla ?. k - The E. J. Taits sat in the circle
with the sweet-consuming Toti, who looked
like a merry doll above the apricot hues of
her gorgeous shawl.
The opening night of “The Dover Road”
Attracted the most fashionable crowd the
l alace has housed since it was “made over.*’
Dozens of the Very Best inhabited the stalls
and the circle, though both boxes turned
aces to the Repertory stage. The
J-;rJ orsters ’ good-looking daughter Rachel
l itt Rivers was cast for leading lady in the
rather skim-milk Milne comedy, and invested
the part with natural grace, beautiful frock-
and a set of Irene Vanbrugh mannerisms,
iter nrst entry was made in a graceful mole
coat; the tossing of that aside revealed a
ravishing geranium-red Jersey silk three-
piece; the next morning’s kipper was eaten
. m a luscious sand-colored charmante, show-
ing the new side sash and just-below-the-knee
skirt; and her third episode was dressed in
nifty green-stripe apparel. The quite-pretty
Ihipson girl was rather colorlessly attired in
whites and browns that didn’t suggest enough
dash for a wife who’s got a man to even
partmUy ran off with her. The lead’s Honor-
abie husband and the vice-regal parents sat
m the centre front of the dress-circle trying
r j modest over the achievement.
Lady k orster in a frock that had been steeped
m a blue moonlit night.
The newly-formed Players’ Club got in be-
fore the Repertory with their version of “The
Dover Road.” Though not such a smooth
?/ tare , rendering as that given by Gregan
McMahon s forces, it showed more originality
in treatment. Eric Howell’s Mr. Latimer
was quite noteworthy; and the two girls in
the .east, Leila Coppola and Vera Keogh, gave
clever portrayals of the high-spirited Anne and
the mimstenng angel Stacia. But the King’s
Hall isn t a good choice for a comedy—the
cramped quarters the other night scarcely left
steering-room around the furniture.
For amiual Bankers’ Ball the top end
of the Town Hall was the Bank of Roses
pillars and primrose-shaded electrics were
linked with the queen of blooms, and the
event was a good deal gayer than a direc-
tors meeting The G.-G.’s lady was the
only vice-regal to turn up—her good-looking
spouse stayed at home to nurse a heavy
cold. Captain Mulholland attended her in
the customary tasty blue lapels. She did
the occasion proud in handsome black and
gold brocades, her soft tresses bound by a
circlet of gold leaves. Mrs. Massie, who
presented the official bouquet of pink roses
and later on the three snow-white debs
dressed her moment in black satin weighted
fTm 1 a Je tI an £, tl ? lastre black panne en-
folded Dr. Cecil Purser’s ladv—he’s the
chairman of Prince Alfred, for whose benefit
the frivol is held. Mrs. C. Walker, organis-
ing chieftain for the big institution, added
the luxury of ermine to black frocking:
violinist Leila Waddell pinned her faith to
maav f! and the French bank was repre-
sented by the Spitzer couple, she in an ivory
marocam model heavy with crystal embroid-
,kast Thursday evening Paddington Town
ilail turned itself into a rose bower for the
ball in aid of Mt. St. Margaret’s Hospital,
at Kyde. This July function is always the
ivose Hall, and a feature used to be the
presentation of a posy to every fair attend-
ing. Hut the growing popularity of the
nance has cut the horticulture out, and this
J. ear x e c “. omrn ‘ttee designed programmes and
tickets with the pretty blooms in various
Si p ac L? s ' Mollie Kelly was again secretary
or the money-raiser, and was modestly
mdiant over its success in rosy georgettes
glittering with sequins. Mrs. W. H. Bull
was treasurer, and Mrs. Muller president of
what was one of the brightest dances of the
week.
The Don’t Forgetters, most of the males
oemg themselves returned Diggers, gathered
at the Wentworth to help their Not For-
Unii League - Judging by the crowded
ballroom—so crowded that only half could
• aace . at a the right-handers alternat-
es with the left-overs—some poor T.B. sol-
dmrs and sailors will be given a fresh lease
During the evening £l9 was made
riom the sale of balloons alone, the cheerful
airs. Harold Vale and Miss
h cott Fell. Mrs. Stanley Davenport, who
had organised the function and was untir-
mg m her efforts to see that everybody gatli-
ei ed rosebuds while the jazz shone, put in
lei hard night s work sustained by luscious
b ack velvets. The kindly General Rosen-
thal couple and 400 other enthusiasts helped
the affair along—among them Mrs. Jack
Campbell, who hostessed a large party.
There was a full house at the Palais the
xv . th , e Feminists’ Red Revel.
Nearly all the club enthusiasts turned up,
looking like anything but themselves. A
flashing-eyed Romany Lass turned out to
be president Miss Preston Stanley; Ruby
shrouded her charms and abundant
and came as a seductive harem-
lady ; Queen Esther had a striking reincar-
nation in Mrs. Wolfcarius ; secretary Mrs.
Liddell sparkled as a red knitting-bag; and
Miss Plummer, the treasurer, upheld the dig-
nity of capital in a French model in flame
georgettes. Another striking costume was
m orn by artist Minns’s wife. She was Aus-
tralian gems.
Lloyd Hutchinson, who came back from
Cambridge to join the N. S. Wales Bar, has
decided to throw in his lot with Louise
Wilson, one of the few women architects
m Scotland. Louise’s dad is that Prof.
Jumbo Wilson who used to teach at Sydney
uni., and is now drumming medicine into
undergrads, at Cambridge.

Mary Bridge, with a head like a Floren-
tine angel s, is busy unwrapping wedding-
presents these days. The great fixture, with
f’ " olin f iynn as second principal, is dated
tor August. Meantime Mary and her parents
are dug in at Eadith Walker’s flat in tlm
Savoy.
The Mayoral Graham couple, of Suva
are visiting the lady’s native State. She
was a Thompson, of Newcastle, and their
return from Fiji to the City of Coals was
celebrated by a civic reception. When not
wearing the mayoral rabbitskin, Mr. Graham
sits behind his law books.
The plan is now open for the demonstra-
tion of eurhythmies to be produced by Mary
Whidborne and Rachel Lewis at the Con.
on Saturday, August 2. Pupils from West-
wood, St. Albans and Meriden will take
part; also some little pupils from Retford
Hall and Tresco. Dorothy Michel, the
winner of the Dalcroze scholarship, will con-
tribute to the programme; and there will be
music too —by Mary McCormack (M.L.
soprano), Frank Hutchens, Lindley Evans
and Cyril Monk.
Kathleen, the auburn-tressed daughter of
General Finn, has been appointed secretary
to the Walter and Eliza Hall Trust. Until
the General’s death he held this position,
Kathleen being his capable assistant.
“The Shop Girl” is the title of the new
comedy to be produced for the benefit of this
State’s Belgian Benevolent Society. The
play is a French three-acter by J. F. Fonson
and F. Wicheler, and the cast includes both
Henriette Segaert and Louise Chautard, in
addition to Henriette’s Consular father, who
is, as usual, producing the comedy as well as
playing a lead.
This Monte Luke photograph of Mrs.
Weatherill was taken just before the produc-
tion of her opera “Neryda” at the Conserva-
torium. Mrs. Weatherill is not content to
rest on her
laurels; she is

on two more
scores which
she hopes to
take to Europe
next year. She
has been a stu-

native of Geelong, most of her life has been
passed in Sydney. To the Waverley-
Rand wick Musical Society, which produced
her work, the energetic lady presented 63
copies of ‘Neryda,” penned and manifolded
by herself.
No one was a stronger barracker for a
great Maggie Moore benefit than Nellie
Stewart. Nellie sat beside E. J. Tait at the
preliminary meeting, and had all prepara-
tions made for appearing in the third
act of ‘‘Sweet Nell of Old Drury” as a com-
pliment to her life-long colleague and friend.
And now Sweet Nell is laid aside with
pleurisy, and to her own and her friend’s
disappointment will be unable to appear on
August 1.
Berry Hay, who returned to Australia
Irom Cambridge the other day with his
mother, was just leaving for one of Otway
b aikmer s stations last week, with the object
of learning the complete art of squatting
when illness smote him. Stewart McKay
operated on him at Lewisham Hospital,
which is a sort of home from home for mem-
bers of the Hay family. They all take their
ailments there. Berry Hay, by the way,
owns the only Bugatti in the Commonwealth •
it is a weird-looking Italian car that recently
broke all records in its class from half a mile
to 10 miles at Brooklands.
The widow of E. J. Wilshire, who died a
lew days ago at Mosman, aged 82, was a
daughter of John Hosking, first Mayor of Syd-
ney (1842), and a grand-daugliter of Samuel
lerry, Australia’s first semi-millionaire
lhe old lady, who was an eminent authority
on ancient Sydney, was born in Pitt-stree't
in a house built by George Crossley, an early
birth-stain attorney, which later became the
property of the Iloskings, and later still the
r4 et i r . opolltan Hotel. She used to tell that the
Tichborne claimant lodged there when cn
route to England. Martin-place now runs
over the site.
There’s a graceful Melbourne chick trailing
models as the mannequin Miss Hetherington
through Good Morning, Dearie.” She’s
Adele Crane, and the possesosr of something
so close to a grand-opera voice that she took
Gladys Moncrieff’s part in “Ivatinka” for
three nights in Melbourne. The girl has an
Oriental tour to her credit, and has appeared
several times at the Liedertafel and munici-
pal concerts in Melbourne. A pupil of Mary
* s ’, si l6 is also a clever musician.
Add to. this blonde locks and a rose-leaf
complexion, and you have the ingredients for
a success that nothing short of a steam-
roller could crush.
Mary Campbell herself is in Sydney quaff-
ing still deeper draughts of opera. Fritz
Hart, of the Melba Con., is doing the same
:r in f; „ Fntz aild Mary run a close second in
the Melba Adoration Stakes. Of course dear
old John Lemmone is allowed to come first
Here’s a draught from the well of truth
by an Anglo-Australian artist who recently
took his wares to London :
Ait in England is a corpse—the deadest thing
evei ! The advertising stunts of Disgustus John and
his brethren have completely killed the profession,
and the R.A. is regarded as a joke. The exhibi-
tion of Brangwyn was a beacon shining through
the murk of what passes for art in these days. There
is really very little fine work being done. R.A.’s
are living on the money they made in the recent
riotous past; others are diverting their attention
to purely commercial art. Judging by signs and
portents, Art in Australia is more healthy than
her sister abroad.
The Joseph Wieners are among the Aus-
tralians who are helping to keep Sydney’s
name on the map: two months spent on the
Continent brought them to London in time
for the opening of Wembley; and thereafter
daughter Beryl took part in entertain-
ing the Boy Scouts. Mrs. Pickles, a well-
known Sydneysider, had a hundred Austra-
hans to her home on the Thames—the great
vv olsey m the days of his fame had his name
over the portal of it.
, rj n h< i . Warwick Armstrong couple lately
landed in England after sampling the winter
sports in Switzerland. They went north
to Scotland; then he came south to look for
some sun and cricket. And found both.
j, .Blie neighbor’s daughter stopped the family
Kin g-street the other morning.
O-oli, she gurgled, “isn’t daddy a pet!
lou know I ve been troubled with a throat
all winter, and the dear has got it into his
head that I don’t wrap up enough. So this
morning he handed me a cheque for £175
to buy a fur coat.” “That seems a fair
amount, the family friend remarked. “It’s
what mother’s cost,” the lambkin replied
ciyptically, as she went on her way. Late
in the afternoon the family friend again ran
into her—-this time in Hunter-street. “Get
the coat?’ he inquired. “No-o!” she re-
sponded. I couldn’t find one that I really
liked, so I bought a pearl necklet.”
. iiterary young woman who has an idea
that she discovered Beethoven is nursing
a P * eg ‘ Tired of her rhapsodies
about the Master, and her attitude of being
he only mind in Sydney that could appre-
ciate him, the Visiting Cat suddenly purred:
Its quite true, dear —everything you say.
Who else could have written a thing like
this, for instance?”—and going to the piano
she soulfully played something out of “The
Pirates of Penzance.” “Wonderful!” ex-
claimed the poetic one, jumping up in a
blaze of enthusiasm. “Poignant! It’s only
Beethoven can touch the very heart!”
A Brisbane postscript:—
The Governor of N.S.W. and Lady de Chair were at
Government House for the week-end.
Sir Matthew went to see Dion Boucicault and Irene
Vanbrugh play “Aren’t We All?” at His Majesty’s.
With him were the Sydney Belisarios, Mrs. Turner
and Hal L Estrange, with Jack Turner A.D.C.-ing.
Sir Matthew went to the at-home’ given
by the president of the Toowong Bowling
Glub after lunching the Feezes at Govern-
ment House; in the evening his Ex. enter-
tained the Belisarios and Hal L’Estrange, and on the
Sunday night the Boucicaults, Mrs. Peter Macgregor,
Mrs. Cullen, Beryl Cullen, George Sampson and
DeVereUX SUpped at Government House. Sir
Matthew also had some people for tennis during the
week, Janet Eccles, of the Boueicault-Vanbrugh co
among them.
n ! hL ; F l° rin Tea held at Bishopsbourne for the
Cathedral fete, Irene Vanbrugh recited “He Fell
Among Thieves,” some verses of Rupert Brooke and
My Earliest Recollection.” Mrs. Beet and Mrs. Martin
sang, and Canon de Witt Batty did “King Charles.”
Archgaiters Sharp and his sister welcomed the big
mob, which included Mrs. Charlie Lilley, of Sydney.
On the 17th New Farm Park woke up from its
green slumber to witness the invasion of a crowd in-
vited to the christening of the boats to be used in
the world’s sculling championship. Mrs. Barry and
Irs. Theodore were the clergy of the occasion, the
Mayoress sprinkling the John Oxley and Mrs. Ted the
Maurice Barry.
The Causerie Francais had its party to celebrate
Frances Day in the Brisbane Women’s Club rooms,
where Conte de Tournouer and M. Henri Tardent wel-
comed a large gathering. Sir Matthew brought a
party, which included the Bruches, Whittinghams
and Glyn Connollys, Major Davies and Captain
Saunders. A fencing display was given by De
Tournouer and M. Welten, and on a programme of
musical and other items figured the names of Luis
Amadeo Pares, Guinand, Eunice Cochrane, Eaton,
Nancy Power and Norali Halford. The comedy “Le
Voyage de Monsieur Perrichon” was given by the
Burstall and Clair matrons, the Conte de Tournouer
Messrs. Tardent, Steer, Gee, Eaton and Guinand and
Prof. Schindler.
At Lennon’s Mrs. Macdonald (Blackall) had a tea
m honor of bride-elect Miss Macdonald amid a
grove of red sweet-pea ; and a card party was arranged
by Mrs. Ray Matthews for another bride-to-be, Mar-
garet East, in a setting of gerberas.
Erie Wilde, grandson of the late Angus Gibson,
ot Bmgera, has made Vida Pumfre.v his wife. Par-
son Atherton, of Drayton, tied the knot at All
Saints’, and the bride, who was given away by her
brother, was in brocaded crepe de Chine and a
Brussels net wedding veil lent by Mrs. Boreham.
Mrs. Pumfrey gave the marriage feast at the Ritz,
and the honeymoon rises in N. Queensland.

P[?] Central 1532, 1533.
Lady Helena Rous crossed to Sydney tlie
other day to shelter under Dame Nellie’s wing
while her vice-regal parents probe the heart
of Australia. Lady Stradbrokc. who has
been more or less on the sick-list for some
weeks, is already on the track with a gent.-
help or so to look after the grips. The Gov-
ernor, who has a date with his wife at Alice
Springs, is still anchored here owing to the
State political eruption. When his Ex. does
shoulder his bluey for Central Australia he
will have Hester Pliillimore as well as his
helps to cheer him on his way, the date of
the lady’s Maoriland visit and return to Eng-
land having been hurriedly pushed down the
calendar when the chance of adding the in-
land trip to her Australian experiences
cropped up.
Mrs. Stanley Bruce spread an afternoon
tea at her South Yarra home the other day
to cheer the Grooms on their way to Eng-
land. It was a sedate, matronly gathering
°f the first social quality. Among the few
political wives there was Mrs. George Pearce.
Mrs. Bruce was in black marocain with gold
embroideries, and there was a golden touch
on her black hat-brim. The guest of honor
lightened her black trappings with silver.
Barrowloads of flowers beautified the recep-
tion parlors, and red and gold poppies flut-
tered over the cakes and sandwiches in the
dining-room. Among the tea-drinkers were the
Arthur Robinson, Frazer. Garran, Best. Mil-
ler, Howse, Maudsley. Isaacs. W. J. T. Clarke,
Darcy Addison (Hobart), J. Elder, Russell
Clarke, John Fisken, William Leonard and
Eric Harrison matrons. Mrs. Clarke is now
the possessor of a new grand-daughter, which
the Stork handed to the Sid Sturts a few days
after the husband got back from inspecting
farm life in Rhodesia with a view to settling
there. (As the prospect did not please him
the pair will probably remain where they
are.) Mrs. Dick Casey was also in the
gathering, doubtless feeling it odd to be a
guest in the big white house which she once
called her home.
Baronet Rupert Clarke has sent a message
from London to say his family circle has
been enlarged by a girl babe. Hitherto two
small sons have been in undisputed possession
of the nursery. The Baronet was to have come
to Australia for a short visit some months
ago, but blue-pencilled the trip so that he
might welcome the little stranger. He hopes
to come south at the end of the year.
Alliance Francaise members celebrated
French National Day with a Bal de Papil-
lions in the St. Kilda Town Hall. Crgpe
paper butterflies jazzed in their thousands
over the blue and pink decorations and flirted
with the baskets of vegetation on the supper
tables, and enamel butterfly brooches and
bobbing balloons were handed round among
the feminine guests. (Late coiners wno
found that baubles were off glared furiously
at a few of the early arrivals who sported
more than their share of the booty.) The
fox-trotting programme was bisected by a
butterfly dance by Eileen Kent and Yalda
Richardson, two of Florrie Greene’s brightest
pupils. French Consul Turck and his wife
(she all a-glitter with crystal beads over
flesh-pink chiffonery) made a triumphal entry
to the stirring strains of “The Marseillaise.”
With them were Italian Consul Grossardi and
his wife, whose blonde bobbed curls shone out
above the raven black satin veiling her slim
elegance. The popular little vice-president.
Mrs. Gay, also in black, followed. Both she
and Mrs. Turck carried tri-colored presenta-
tion posies. During supper. Rene Vander-
kelen read cabled greetings from the absent
president, Mrs. Jimmy Dyer. He mentioned
that Mrs. Dyer is now in the French capital,
and has been there handed the Alliance
medal.
Chica Edgeworth Somers said she would to
Dr. Gilbert Boileau at St. Pat.’s Cathedral
the other night. She was led to the tryst
by her medical father, and trailed ivory velvet
under a Limerick lace veil moored to her
head with orange blossoms. Sisters Flor-
ence Somers and Mina Boileau. with Eleanor
Heazlewood and Lorn a Hiskins, looked after
the bride in blue Bouncings clouded with
tulle veils. Dr. Kevin Brenner had a trio
of assistants—Neville Somers. Edmund
Boileau and Frank Cole—to help him best-
man the groom. Dr. and Mrs. Edgeworth
Somers afterwards entertained their friends
in the Hotel Windsor.
Geelong s horse-and-liare week drew people
from as far afield as the Ma State and S.
Australia. The strangers gasped to find the
streets of the Sleepy City buzzing with ’buses
and to hear that the local inhabitant casually
takes a ’bus to and from Melbourne for a
theatre or a concert —and that at only about
half the time and cost of a train journey.
The moving spirit in this riot of progress is
Senator Guthrie, the most widely popular
man in the district. There was coursing
every day of the week but Wednesday, when
the Race Club’s steeplechase meeting was
staged. Mrs. Robert Vincent, wife of the
racing-club president, dispensed afternoon tea
in the wattle grove known as the Plantation,
where the new-born blossoms splashed the
landscape picturesquely with gold. In this
radiant setting she welcomed her guests in
brown dressings warmed with a fur-trimmed
braided coat and topped with a hat that
sported an autumn-tinted wreath. Mrs.
James Robertson, from Barwon Heads, stood
by in a mole-colored wrap under a drenched
feather hat. Mrs. Frank Guthrie’s fairness
shone out above a fur-edged black coat, while
a glittering arrow pierced the darkness of
her hat. Mary Bostock, Mary Armytage and
Nesta McKellar were a youthfully attractive
trio in neat tweeds under little pull-on black
lids. Mrs. Willie McCulloch had a dark blue
rig, Mrs. James Russell sported a chinchilla
coat topped with a mole hat, Mrs. Alec
Robertson (S.A.) was greyed like a cloud,
but had a rosy-patterned lining twinkling
from her hat-brim. Mrs. T. Bailey brought
daughter Mollie from Melbourne to join in
the week’s whirl; the S. Grimwade pair con-
voyed .daughter Gertrude, and several of the
Austins and other Western District tribes
supported the horsey occasion.
. That day finished with the Waterloo Cup
Ball, which yearly helps the funds of Gee-
long’s Free Kindergarten. It was held in St.
Mary s Hall, which was swamped under
wattle blossoms for the occasion. Jim
Blakely and Keith Bostock, as lion, secs., saw
that the whirl was a happy one, and Sena-
tor Guthrie dispensed cheerfulness all round.
Mrs. Frank looked arresting in misty black
which twinkled'at the edges with diamente.
Mrs. Sidney Smith was there with her hus-
band, who looms large in local sporting circles
as sec. to both racing and coursing clubs.
Mrs. H. A. Anderson glittered in black jet,
barraging georgette, while Miss Lascelles,
who helped on the committee, curtained black
satin with lace. Mrs. Ormond Foster’s rosy
upholsterings carried a dado of hand-made
fruit and flowers : Mrs. James Russell hid her
ball draperies under a silken shawl; Hope
Rutherford (S.A.) jazzed in a waistless frock
of mauve brocade, hooped about the knee with
white swansdown; Mrs. Geoff Straehan was
hung with white satin inlaid with gold, and
Audrey Pooley had silver lace surrounding
her blue silk.
Mrs. Guthrie was out at the coursing each
afternoon with her small, dark-eyed daughter
Mary. Her Senator and his fellow commitee-
men spread lunch parties every day for all
distinguished guests, who included one or two
political lights. The weather was attractive,
but the dogs found the going too hard on the
dry Plumpton. The number of kills was
unusually high, and fresh hares—loo all told
—had to be hurriedly ordered in. Many spec-
tators new to the sport openly wailed over
the suffering of the little brown creatures,
and implored those in the know to tell them
why in the name of goodness hounds can’t
race each other without bringing butchering
into it. Whippet racing might solve the
great problem. The little hounds dearly
love sprinting along the track —and why
not ?
Lafayette, of Perth, made this picture of
Phyllis Browning-Turner, Westralia’s 20-
year-old contralto, who has been awarded
a two-years’ exhibition at the Royal Aca-
demy of Music,
London, and
expects to
leave for the
Fog at the
end of the
year. She com-
menced h e r
studies with
Prof. A. J.
L e c k i e in
1922, gaining
in that year
the W.A. ’Var-
sity’s singing
prize an <1
honors in the
i n t ermediate
grade of the
As s o c i ated
Board’s exam.
Last year she
passed with
honors in the
advanced
grade, and won the Board’s medal for the
highest singing marks in the State, while at
the recent W.A. Eisteddfod she bagged a
first, second and two hon. mentions. The
gifted young person—she is a pianist, lin-
guist and something of a penwoman—comes
of musical stock. Her mother, then Ida
Browning, gave great pleasure in Westralia
in other years with a fine soprano voice.
Tlie Art Gallery has just bought a small
landscape for 100 guineas. It is not known
for certain who the artist is, but the picture
has every appearance of being a Corot, and
the trustees have chanced it and hung it
as such. If it is a genuine Corot, it is a
wonderful bargain considering that “The
Rent Tree” brought £5750 or thereabouts;
On the other hand it may be merely a copy
by an amateur. Director t Bernard Hall re-
ports that the find was quite as good-looking
as a Corot, but it is admitted that its history
is unknown.
The Montgomery sisters had a packed St.
Kilda Town Hall for their young people’s
ball, the financial results of which go to the
S.P.G.A., of which the sisters are two of
the keenest committee members. The party
was one of the cheeriest juvenile events of
the jazzy season, a fact largely due to Gee-
long and Melbourne Grammar boys being
there in rival dozens. One of the host-
esses was all a-sparkle with black beads
hedged round with marabout, while the other
provided a rival glitter of white crystal cir-
cumferenced with gold. Frank Schlesinger
and his wife, in an interval, showed how the
Blues really should be danced in all its varia-
tions. Many of the young things, who, like
old friend Midshipman Easy, believe that
dancing and chatter should be twins at social
gatherings, heartily admired the exhibition,
but inwardly decided that _ the complexities
of the Blues-de-luxe would give one no chance
of getting better acquainted with one’s pari>
ners. Among the elders who, had brought
their young folk along Were Mi's. Norman
Falkiner, the Richard Lintons, Mrs. Fbrdyde
Wheeler and Mrs, Leonard Bucklaiid,
This is Johnstone P’BbaUiiassy’S present-

Leaving Gen-
eral Brudenell
White as his

th e veteran
tripped off a
fe w months
back to see
his daughters
who married
and settled in
England. One
son and
daughter (Mrs.
Dudley Tren-
chard) live in
M e 1 b ourne;
also a small
grand - daugh-
ter, whose
father, the
late Major
Collins,
was killed in
the war, and
whose mother, the younger daughter of the
late Richard Grice pair, died less than a
year later. Since severing his connection
with Reuters in 1909, after 47 years’ service,
90 of them as general-manager for Australia,
Henry Collins has devoted much time to
philanthropic and charitable endeavor, with
the Alfred as liis chief interest. On his way
to the other side of the Equator he put in
at the Cape, where he was accorded a great
reception by the press, which hailed him
as a man who had been associated with
S’Africa during the Boer War. He was
holidaying in England when that disturb-
ance broke out, and was hurried off to the
scene of trouble by his co. to organise a
service which would gather news from the
far-flung fighting areas and broadcast it
throughout the world.
The Harry Prells had a Sunday-afternoon
tea at their new Ivooyong bungalow in honor
of Mrs. Roystone Davey, amid a setting of
violets and rosy blossoms. The hostess gave
a touch of tangerine to her navy crepe, while
Mrs. .Davey, who had her husband under her
wing, was in mole tailorings with a fur coat,
and had a brown plume surging to red curled
round her felt toque. Among the big crowd
of tea-drinkers were Mrs. Albert Miller and
her elder hope, Bertie, the Nicholas Lockyers,
Mrs. Bowes Kelly and daughter Lyle, Mrs.
Harry Ford, Ernestine Stevenson and her
sister, Mrs. John Gurner, Mrs. Drought, the
Bridges pair, General Tivey and his flapper
daughter, Mrs. E. Millar and the R. Cowpers,
who are ere this in Sydney, where they are
to spend a few weeks. The Albert Miller
widow also gave a tea on Friday in honor of
Mrs. Davey, who left for the Harbor the fol-
lowing day.
The Cellini-Cimara-Zacherawitsch com-
bination woke Melbourne up to a decided
enthusiasm with their first recital in the
Town Hall. There were encores galore, and
fiddler, singer and pianist all got laurel
wreaths tied up with the Italian colors.
Carmen Pasco va (formerly Carmen Pins-
chof), temporarily understudying Essie Ack-
land, who has had a bout with the ’flu, was
awarded two floral tributes, both in pastel
colorings, which found a nice background in
the lady's rosy draperies, shimmered over
with gold beads. The singer’s likeness to hex-
dead mother, Madame Wiedermann, is very
striking. The hall was thickly peppered
with the Best Known. The Arthur Robin-
son lady was in the balcony, and the
Maudsley dame in the front chairs with Mrs,
Bertie Austin* Mrs* Dick Casey Was ill
the first i'ow with the Campbell Boggs, pair;
and g’Henry ParkeFs daughter Mildred, fav :
ishingly enclosed in a liiahve silk shawl; Toiii
Cochran convoyed a , smart-lbpking English
woman and another Cold Land vistor, Willii)
Ducroz, whose people are associated with
the Dalgety firm oversea. The Italian and
French Consuls sat in a special half-circle
with their wives, each lady armed with a
presentation bouquet, and gossip said that a
dimpled brunette seated with them was the
wife of one of the stars. The Mayoral
Bruntons also inhabited a special reserve,
and musical lights twinkled all over the hall.
The Reggie Wilmots’ elder daughter Grace
confesses intending matrimony with a young
Irishman, Frank Story, whose late father,
Lieut.-Col, Story, lived at Bingfield, Co,
Cavan. The Wilmots lately sold their Brigh-
ton home, Boort, which had been in the
family for three generations, and settled on
a property at Box Hill,
Mrs. Gilbert Lodge gave a lunch* and
theatre-party for 20 as a farewell blessing to
the lady of Littleton Groom, who is off to tile
League of Nations, The mid-day meal Was
at Menzies’, and the play was “The Wheel, 1 ’
after which the all-feminine party Was
motored back to the. hotel for a final .shack.
The guests, all of Whom sported a gift,Posy
of purple . and maiivb flowers, included
Admiral, Hall Thompson’s wife and dauglitef,
the Bridges, White,. Lafcy Addison, Arthiit
Morris, Albert Miller and J. Ik Doylfe
matrons and Jessie Broom.
Lieuti-Colonel Rupert Ryan, D. 5.0., only
son of General “Plevna” Ryan, was married
to the Hon. Rosemary Hay last month. She
went over to Coblenz with her grandfather,
the Earl of Errol, for the ceremony, and will
live there for the present, as ht*r husband is
deputy to her father, Lord Kilmarnock, who
is High Commissioner on the Rhine. She is
just 20.
Admiral Clarkson and his wife have de-
cided to go to grass in Sydney, and the lady
paved the way for her departure with a tea-
drinking in the Quamby Club. The affair
served the double purpose of farewelling both
herself and Mrs. Roystone Davey. The
hostess, in navy georgette, smiled under an
Orientally-colored hatbrim. Heading the
guest list were her two sisters (Miss Hawker
and Mrs. Henry), the Robinson, Best, George
Paxton, Talbot Brett and Virgoe matrons,
Mrs. Edward Nortlicote and daughter Doris,
and Miss Cotton and Erica Lines, here on a
visit from Sydney.
A few lines from Adelaide
The Palais was bedecked in flags, with the tricolor
predominant, for France’s Day Ball, and there Were
balloons and posies, caps and flags which dancers
bought readily. Masks were compulsory and fancy
dress optional. Lady Bridges, in draped white that
frothed to a line of ostrich feathers about its hetn,
came when the dancing was well started, and Was
welcomed by French Consul Frank Moulden—he, poor
soul, bereft of his wife, who Was one of the hardest
workers for the ball and had been prisoned at home
by an untimely germ,
Passengers by the Ulysses included the S. R.
Morgans, who wel‘e married in London the other day.
He, now a coming lawyer and something of a poet
in his ’Varsity days, is a son of the Ran Morgans,
and his wife is the only grand-daughter of the late
Peter Waite.
The younger set is agog over the engagement of
popular Phyllis Bray, elder daughter of the Cecil
Brays, to Andrew Tennant. He was one of the
jockeys at the Hunt Club’s meeting at Cheltenham
on Saturday, and had the bad luck to be. shed by
his mount ill the Drag Cup—fortmiitely without
much damage resulting.
As far as dressing went, the Hunt Club’s meeting
was mostly a coat-and-skirt affair, with a brave
showing of apache handkerchiefs —very brave, in
some cases. Lady Bridges (small daughter Alvida
and Major Clowes came with her) was rust-colored
as to dress and black as to headgear, Two of the
smartest frockers owed a debt to almond green—one
a. recent bride who plumped for the alluring color for
frock and hat, and the other a. well-clad damsel who
chose it for the hat that topped her smartly-cut
brown coat.
The death of Miss Mabel Hardy removes owe of
the best known of the older generation. Time was
when the Hardy home was one of the most hospitable
in the State, famed for dinners and lunches of a
genus almost unknown in this age of clubs and hotels
and a continually-lacking Mary Ann. Her hobby was
the Girls’ Friendly Society, and when she resigned
the secretaryship a purse of sovereigns told of her
fellow committee-women’s regard.
Across Australia from Adelaide to Darwin is
becoming a popular trip. Walter Duncan, M.L.C.,
Essington Lewis, of the B. IT. Proprietary, and Harold
Darling have just motored through. Last week the
fortnightly train from Adelaide to the fail-head at
Oodnadatta was crowded. Stefansson goes to Alice
Springs, at the invitation of the Federal Government,
and will make some excursions from there. Keith
Ward, S.A.’s Government Geologist, lias gone with
him. The Countess of Stradbroke plans to motor
through. Her husband will join the party as soon
as the political situation in Victoria settles down a
bit. Professor Osborne and Dr. Herbert Basedow arc
the scientists attached to the expedition ; the party
includes several ladies.

a change, Sydney punters had a bit
the better of things at Moorefleld on Saturday, five of
the nine winners being favorites and three second
favorites. One of the latter was Woodville (Linacre —
Auriga), who has furnished into a very handsome fel-
low and has a knack of winning “first up”—an excel-
lT nt -^ hing in horses - Behind him were useful Jim
Murillo and the three-year-old Lakawanna, who
looked a bit above herself and may be expected to
improve. Other features of the meeting were Toohey’s
masterly handling of the grey Doris Lynn (5’s) iri
the Moorefleld Handicap and Bedonia’s exercise canter
m the first division of the Juvenile, for which he was
an even money chance. Like Salitros, with whom he
has been compared, Bedonia is a chestnut by Lime-
light, but he is not so ruggedly built as the 1920
Derby winner nor so stoutly bred on the dam’s side.
The indications are that Heroic will be most in
request for this year’s Randwick classic until it is
definitely proved that he cannot stay.
John Barker has retired from the chair-
manship of the S.A.J.C. after holding it since 1909,
when he succeeded the lawyer-politician-sportsman
Richard Chaffey Baker.
Tom Barr Smith also
retires from the com-
mittee after 27 years’
sendee. The new chair-
man, W. B. (“Doc”)
Carr, has been on the
committee only five
years, but before that
he was for a long time
chairman of the Adel-
aide R. C. In earlier
days he was for 12
years sporting editor
of the Register, and
he holds the Australian
record of 20 years (and
still going) as chair-
man of the Adelaide

or his fences and never improved his position in the
rearguard, vigorously as Gray rode him. Thom owl,

ln . was. favorite at 5 to 2, but he was done
with half a mile from home, and Berrigan (6's).
got up in the last stride to beat Roisel and Pildin by
half a head. Roisel has list. 21b. in the Australian
Hurdle; Berrigan and Pildin are not engaged. Les
Paddington has been withdrawn from both Hurdle
and Steeple; but Palbi will worthily represent Rand-
wick in the race over the big timber ; his success at
Caulfield on Saturday (Moon rode him and 5 to 2
was his price) was very easily achieved. Havelock
(3’s), a nice cut of a gelding by Lucknow —Cardinal
and Black, annexed the Lillimur Two-year-old rather
impressively, and the much-talked-of Tookarby (9
to 2) outstayed the M. L. -bred Tressayr and Imputa-
tion in the 11-furlongs Murrumbeena Handicap, run
in 2min. 21see. A five-year-old bay gelding by Sea
Prince—Caram, Tookarby has 7st. 41b. in the Metro-
politan (101 b. less than he carried on Saturday) and
6st. 131 b. in the Caulfield Cup, and backers are keep-
ing him in mind. Spearsum, who belonged to the
Governor’s lady, fell in the Murrumbeena, and Simmons,
the jockey, was taken to the hospital in a serious
condition, while the horse and Corunna, who also
came down, were destroyed by the vet. Simmons is
the boy who has won three Cups on Wynette.

“Loud”: London Referee seems to have
found a way to get round the Act that makes
lotteries illegal. It offers a £395 motor-car, 25
cash prizes of £IOO each, and a lot of silver cups,
and the tickets are three bob. True, the winners
are not drawn out of a hat or a barrel. They have
to come out near the top in an enormous bridge
tournament. Given any knowledge at all of the
game, the cards admittedly do 80 or 90 per cent, of
the work ; but it is believed that the trifle of skill
involved is just enough to keep the scheme outside
the Gaming Act.
* * * *
With the cycle races to come, Australia
has had three winners at the Olympic Games—
Charlton in the 1500 metres swim, Eve in the plain
high diving, and Winter in the hop, step and jump.
All three belong to Manly (N.S.W.), a fastness of
amateur sport. In addition, Charlton was third in
the 400 metres to Weismuller, the American, and
Arne Borg ; Beaurepaire was third in the 1500 metres
to Charlton and the Swede —a great performance for
a man who wall a champion before “Boy” was born—
and the Australians were second to the Americans in
the 800 metres teams race. No one else did any-
thing memorable. Bull, the sculler, beat the French
competitor in his heat, but cracked up in the final,
which was won by the Englishman Beresford, second
at Antwerp four years ago to the U.S. representative,
Kelly. The Murray Bridge eight was a great dis-
appointment. Second in their heat to the Italians
(Spain was third), the Cods were outed in the semi-
final by the Canadians (Argentina also headed them),
who chased the Yanks home in the final, with Italy
third. “Stale” is one explanation of the Murray
Bridgers’ indifferent showing, and no doubt they were
stale; but advancing years also had something to
do with it. The average age of the South Australians
is 32; the U.S. and Canadian crews, on the other
hand, were composed of husky young University men
whose youth enabled them to make light of climatic
and dietary difficulties that botnered the older men.
Bayley and Willard shaped creditably in the lawn-
tennis department without getting among the points,
and Sinclair, one of the boxers (the others were
swiftly eliminated), was travelling well until he was
adjudged to have lost on points to a Bulgarian. It
was one of several disputed decisions; in a later case
than Sinclair’s, the English-speaking competitors re-
fused to continue until the judges had altered their
verdict in favor of a French middleweight who had
not only been given a boxing lesson by an English
opponent, but had sunk his teeth in the Anglo-Saxon’s
chest.
Nurmi, the unbeaten Finn, must be accounted the
most dazzling performer at the Games, but Charlton
surely comes next. It was a marvellous achievement
for a youngster not yet 17 to make hacks of the
world’s best in the 1500 metres and establish record
after record in the process —21min. 20 *3-ssec. in
the first heat, and, in the final, 800 metres in
lOmin. 34sec., 1000 in 13min. 19 4-ssec., and 1500
in 20min. 6 3-ssec. —lmin. 53 2-ssec. faster than
Hodgson’s time at Stockholm in 1912. Equally
amazing was the sprint which landed him within
two yards of the great Weismuller in the final of the
400 metres, which is not his distance, and for
which the Yank had been specially reserved, whereas
Charlton had had three competition swims over
1500 metres and two over 400 metres in five days. And
then on the eighth day he covered a great 200 metres
in the relay race. The lad is a phenomenon, but he
was asked to do too much. It is a way we have with
our kid-athletes. Had the youngster been in Ameri-
can hands he wouldn’t have been allowed to start
in the 400 metres, let alone the relay. The Ameri-
cans are far more careful of their championship
material; it is one of the secrets of their success at
these Olympiads.
“Hamer”: I might have got home earlier on the
day the news came through that “Boy” had won the
1500 metres if I hadn’t met so many of his fathers.
The first v 7 ho thrust himself upon my knowledge—
it was in a Surry Hills bar—started ’by giving me
an inventory of the drinks he had had. “But sup-
posin’ you had a son w'ho had beaten the world’s
best, wouldn’ chou?” he said. “Yes, my name is
Charlton.” Numerous drinks after that I found my-
self assuring someone else that he could not be
Charlton — the Charlton —considering that I had seen
the real one fall into a motor-’bus somev'here at the
other end of the town after I had told the con-
ductor to drop him at Manly. The indignation with
which my new friend denounced the previous im-
postor was so convincing that I introduced him as
Mr. Charlton to all my friends in the bar —I didn’t
know their names, but their faces seemed friendly
and they didn’t mind drinking at my expense to the
champion’s father. After that I got so used to
meeting Charltons, some of them proud uncles, but
most .of them proud fathers, that I did not worry
to dispute their identity until the ticket-collector
woke me up on the last train home, or thereabouts.
His face was familiar, and I greeted him as a long-
lost friend. “Yes, I see you nearly every night on
the train. My name is Charlton.” I don’t know
what happened to that ticket-collector, because I
took the next boat to Europe, and was just showing
how “Boy” broke the record when the splash woke
my wife and she came into the bathroom and pulled
me out. Also, she said it was disgraceful. She has
repeated that remark quite often since; but, after
all, it is not every day that Australia produces a
champion who has a father or an uncle in every bar
in Sydney.
“Phil Pillface”: Water is almost Dick Eve’s native
element: he was born at Parramatta (N.S.W.)
baths. His father built the Alameda baths in Cali-
fornia, where Dick won the State diving champion-
ship ; his grandfather got within 200 yards of swim-
ming the Channel; and he is a nephew of Arthur
and Syd Cavill, famous swimmers and instructors.
Dick is a good footballer and tennis player. Some of
the congratulations which flowed over the cable to
Paris came from Longreach (Q.), which football club
he joined when following his profession of wrool-
classer.
* * * *
“D.”: It is rather saddening to read “Boy”
Charlton’s repeated assertions that he is “coming
back to go on the land,” that he “will not let
swimming interfere with his career as a farmer,”
and so on. One is reminded of the protestations of
Gregory-—now playing tennis and grade cricket in a
Sydney suburb—that no sporting will o’ the wisp
would lure him from the out-back station to which
he intended to dedicate his life. Charlton is of
course sincere. They all are. But the combined
calls of pleasure and the press are usually too strong.
The attitude adopted by some of our sport-mad
journals is that a phenomenal bat, bowler or
swimmer who refuses to place his gifts at the service
of his country on demand is a traitor, and that those
who encourage or even condone such conduct are
as bad or worse. It was this kind of raging, tearing
propaganda that sent the unfortunate Adrian over-
seas—though experienced men associated with him
knew that the excitement of foreign travel was one
of the worst things possible for his trouble —-and it
is ready to be unloosed against any other athlete
who flouts the popular whim of the moment. The
gladiator, amateur or professional, has a good time
while he remains at the top of the tree. But there
is no money in any sport but prize-fighting, and the
fame won at athletics is the most ephemeral of all.
There is no one more neglected by the crowd than a
broken pug. or a superannuated cricket or tennis
champion. If Charlton is wise he will drop inter-
national swimming, but if the papers have their way
he will drop work.

“Adelaide”: If Grimmett really pulls liis
weight in the South Aus. XI, that State may again
have something to say in the Sheffield Shield. Purely
local bowling, that of Giffen and Lyons, assisted by
Reedman, brought it quite to the front in the earl'v
’nineties, just when the Shield was instituted. But
all through the time when Ernest Jones and Travers
were at their best, with Darling and Clem Hill bat-
ting also at their best, S.A. never got quite to the
top, though it might win a match every season and
so turn the balance in favor of either Victoria or
N.S.W. About 1909 Roy Hill and Rees did good
work, but since then the Adelaide wickets have
seemed discouragingly good, and the purely local
bowling has not been up to the form outside. O’Con-
nor was engaged as a coach, Whittv came from
N.S.W. and Crawford from England as amateurs
who could find plenty of time for cricket, and Clem
Hill near the close of his career had the satisfaction
of gathering in the Shield twice. Since the war
S.A. has not won a match in the competition at all;
though easy wins over Maclaren’s team and Queens-
land show that the local form is good enough against
anything but the best.
* * * *
“15-30”: Vincent Richards compensated
for his failure at Wimbledon by succeeding
at the Olympic Games. Richards’s colleagues in
the American team, Norris Williams, Hunter and
Washburn, were eliminated early, and it shows
France’s strength this year when two Gauls, Cochet
and Borotra, fought out a semi-final, the first-named
winning rather easily by three sets to one. In the
other semi-final Richards knocked out De Morpurgo,
the Italian Davis Cup player, who did rather well
against Denmark and in 1922 was expected to cause
anxiety to Patterson at Wimbledon. He revealed his
class in the Games by defeating Washer, the Belgian,
who cut short Norman Brookes’s career in the English
classic, after Washer had captured the scalp of
Hunter, Vincent Richards’s team-mate in the doubles.
In the final of the singles at Paris, Richards beat
Cochet: 6—4, 6 —4. 4—6, 5 —7, 6 —2. Continental
countries are benefiting immensely from these inter-
national contests, and in time must develop players
who will seriously challenge the English-speaking
cracks. This year France has a good sporting chance
of reaching the challenge round for the Cup, and with
the experience gained, anyhow, should go very near
taking the drinking vessel to Paris in 1925. Tilden
and Johnston can’t go on playing for ever, and the
next best in sight do not suggest that Uncle Sam is
invincible.
At one stage of the shoot for the King’s
Prize at Bisley it looked as if Eastmon, the West-
ralian, might bring the bauble to the Commonwealth
for the first time since 1907. In the end, however,
Private Bourke, a young Canadian, won rather
easily with an aggregate of 230, but eight Australians
qualified for the final stage. Previously the Afrikan-
ders had carried off the Kolapore Cup, with the
Canadians and British next and our men fourth.

So evenly matched are the teams in this
season’s Vic. League competition that, with but five
games more to finish the first round, only one—Mel-
bourne —is definitely out of the hunt. An unusual
feature is the way various teams maintain sequences
of wins or losses. Richmond started by losing four
games right off; then they won the next four. Fitz-
roy won the first eight; then lost the next four.
Collingwood won four, and lost the next six. On
Saturday Fitzroy were at home to the Tigers and
went down by 10 points—s 4 to Richmond’s 64 —
mainly through the latter’s better system and
superior marking. Also, South found St. Hilda's
concerted play too much for tlieir speed and sure-
ness, and lost their high position by four points—SS
to Saints’ 92. Carlton outed Melbourne with diffi-
culty, and a tally of 62 points to 55; and Essendon
stepped to the head of the procession by collecting
74 points to Geelong’s 62. Fitzroy’s goal-getter,
Moriarty,' now owns 53 goals; his nearest competi-
tors are Johnson (S. Melb.) and Hagger (Geelong),
with 36 each. Carlton’s star, Clover, boasts only
26, while last season’s record-breaker, Stockdale,
hasn’t booted a score.
* * * *
Balmain and South Sydney, who are lead-
ing for the Sydney Rugby League premiership, were
concerned in two exciting matches on Saturday. In
one Balmain downed Glebe by 13 to 7, thanks
largely to Kennedy, their brilliant wing three-quarter,
who twice crossed in ; in the other a sparkling try
by Wearing just on time enabled South to defeat
’Varsity by 12 to 11. Uni.’s defence was splendid,
and in a sense they were unlucky to lose. In the
other games, St. George drew with Newtown, 25 points
each, and Western Suburbs overcame North Sydney,
20 —16. With only one round to go, Balmain and
South have each 13 points—five wins, a defeat and
a drawn game.
“Centurion”: Having trounced N.S.W.
in two of the three fine Sydney contests, the All
Blacks have gone back to Maoriland, where they
will play two matches, and be joined by three backs
and three forwards, before heading for Europe.
They have satisfied all the critics on this side that
they are a class combination. The forwards combine
height and weight with remarkable pace, and the
backs are uncommonly tricky and clever. H. G.
Munro’s splendid hooking, combined with his dash
and opportunism in all the outside work, made the
pony forward exceptionally useful all round in a
batch of sterling performers. Certainly Nepia, the
full-back, showed form far below that of Joe War-
brick and Sergeant-major O’Brien of old, but he
tackled well, and his line-kicking was good on the
whole. His failure as a place kick is ascribed by
some to the lighter and livelier ball, due to the
drier grounds and climate. The three-quarter line
has a star centre in Brown, and Svenson, though
he played on the wing here, is another exceptionally
good man in the middle, while Lucas is a fine, hard-
running winger. And there is Cooke, at five-
eighth, whose elusive, kangaroo-like hop is reminis-
cent of D. J. Nelson, once of Sydney Uni., N.S.W.,
and Queensland. Dailey, the number two scrum
half, gave a great exhi-
bition in the last two
matches, his passing
out being particularly
fast and accurate. He
was well guarded by
Porter, but is full of
devil in the open, too.
Porter, though some
of the critics fell foul
of him, played as much
onside as is possible
for a wing forward,
who is born to trouble
as the sparks fly up-
ward. Pity Maoriland
doesn’t put Porter in
the pack, for he is a
great player enough in
the legitimate stuff.
To sum up, from the
three-quarter line on-
wards, these All Blacks
look more like the real
old Dominion stuff
than any side that has
crossed the Tasman
since the Armistice.
JOCK RICHARD-
SON, vice-
captain of the
All Blacks.
“Past Grammar”: The failure of the N. S. Wales
Rugby team against the All Blacks seems to be due
to the same cause as that which let down their
League contemporaries against the Englishmen—
obsession with attack to the exclusion of defence
lor a long time past N.S.W. has been tinkering with
the rules “to make the game faster,” and has con-
stantly quoted the dangerous aphorism that attack
* s the best defence. Wiser in their generation, the
Maorilanders stuck to the old system of improving
their players and letting the rules stand. As a result,
they have been able to show that fast and pretty
football can be allied with sound defensive methods,
and that without cutting the rules to suit one’s own
game. Our forw-ard play needs stiffening, and
sounder and better combined defensive methods are
required from the backs, some of whom rely entirely
on their capacity to intercept an opponent’s pass
to stop an attack. In short, play is taking on too
much of the League spirit of flashy work in the
open, and that is no good in the R.U. game.
There was no knockout at the Sydnej
Stadium on Saturday night, but count-outs were
frequent, the crowd being dissatisfied with the enter-
tainment provided by Bert Spargo (9st. 2jib.) and
Joe Fox (9st. 2ilb.). Spargo was groggy in the
fourth, fifth and thirteenth, but he won most of the
other rounds, and few agreed with the referee’s
decision —Fox on points. There was £663 in the
house; £331 10s. for the management and £165
16s. for each pug. Better fights have been seen in
a bar-room by sports who improved the shining half-
hour by pinching unguarded beer.
* * * *
“Lily B.” : George Tosli, who has knocked
out all his opponents in the £2OOO tournament at
Sydney Stadium, and is a hot favorite for the final
comes from Gilgandra (N.S.W.) and is only 19.
He learned boxing from his father, who used to spar
with him until the youngster thoughtlessly presented
Tosh, senior, with a black eye. Dad thereupon
announced his retirement from the sparring-partner
business.
u** * *
“Feng-Shui”: The two champions stood
racing each other in the middle of a ring of brown
spectators. Their seconds twisted their limbs, blew
down their throats and spat in their eyes to arouse
their martial ardor. The excitement mounted to
fever pitch, and a rain of Dutch ringaats and even
English sovereigns descended around the principals.
The light of a single oil-lamp gleamed on the six-
inch stilettos of hard steel with which the combat-
ants were armed. A gong sounded and thev were
released They crept stealthily round each' other,
looking for an opening with quick sidelong glances.
There was a rush of two bodies through the air, a
soft impact, and one of the contestants lay gasping
on his side with a gaping wound in his neck, while
the other strutted round the ring, followed by the
frantic “soraks” of the crowd. The loser’s second
angrily dragged his champion to his feet, and blew
down his throat and spat in his eye more vigorously.
The gong sounded again, and once more the con-
testants faced one another. One was full of jaunty
confidence; the other staggered like a drunken man,
his glazing eye wandering aimlessly away from his
antagonist’s and his weapon trailing on the floor
behind him. As he raised his head in a last effort
at defiance, his enemy launched himself at him, and
in less than a second he was lying on his back, with
the last beats of his heart visible to all the spec-
tators through the wound his adversary had dealt
him. A breast feather from the winning- bird drifted
slowly down the air on top of him. I witnessed
this nauseating spectacle at Bali, Dutch East Indies.
Twenty years ago, when I lived within smelling dis-
tance of Cook’s River (N.S.W.), cock-fighting was
a regular Sunday pastime, and I believe it has been
furtively practised since at places like Broken Hill
and Kalgoorlie. But it is illegal in all white coun-
tries, though encouraged by the Dutch in their spice
islands.
A SUGGESTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
When people went to the races, they put on
£f K r brightest clothes. Why should they put on
S f loth ®u K g0 to chur ch? He was heart and
soul for a brighter church’ movement.”— lieu. S. ll
Coxy of Sydney.
Folk who go racing wear
Gay rags and glad ones,
Those who to church repair
Sombre and sad ones.
Just why it should be so
I do not rightly know
But think the chance is
That the two sections far
Apart in outlook are
With tastes dissimilar
And varying fancies.
Yet sports and churchmen both
From Cox’s movement
Might, you can take your oath,
Derive improvement
Touching the way they’re drest.
Permit me to suggest,
My Christian brother,
Those who to Randwick turn,
And those whose sole concern
Is Soul, may something learn
Each from the other.
If books in black cravats,
And gapless collars,
And solemn stovepipe hats
Raked in the dollars ;
If punters thronged the totes
In sweeping “iiogger” coats,
If women gracing
The scene laid scantier stress
On variegated dress
We might have somewhat less
High-colored racing.
Sidesmen in racecourse rig,
Fashion’s reflections,
From many a flock might dig
More in collections.
And —take it not as slight
On alb or surplice white,
Cassock or mitre—
Parsons in checks that scream,
With rings and pins that gleam,
Would make the gloomiest theme,
The dourest Bethel, seem
A trifle brighter.

Yes, it’s a fact it brings prosperity, because
not only does it replace 8 horses on the farm for ploughing, harrowing, seeding,
harvesting, hauling, etc., but it works quicker, turns shorter and will work right
on for 24 hours on end, if necessary, without getting sore shoulders. It saves and
makes money by doing work impossible to horses, for with its power it pumps water,
saws wood, cleans tanks, threshes the grain, and does scores of other jobs about
the farm. Don’t take our word for it, but ask a Cletrac owner.

THE INKY WAY.
Maoriland has lost another good pressman in Eric
Ramsden, who has been collected by W. H. Morton-
Cameron, of London Globe, as his assistant foreign
editor. Ramsden started on the Wairarapa Age and
carried on in Wellington and Auckland.
Hobart Mercury, which, in spite of its grand-
motherliness, is one of the things Tasmania can well
be proud of, was 70 the other day. All its years it
has been in the Davies family, although nowadays it
has a Board reinforced by two outsiders.
E. George Marks, of the Sydney Sun and author
of several books, the other day received a request
from Tarakrnth lias, Director of the Oriental Research
Library, New York, for permission to translate his.
latest book, “Watch the Pacific,” into Hindoo, Chinese
and Japanese, and to allow publication in news-
papers of those countries. The request was granted.
Taraknath Das, by the way, translated the Indian and
Japanese protocols at the Congress of Versailles.
“Pick”: Billy. Boot, who recently went off the
Inky Way at Moruva (N.S.W.), was an example of
grit. After strenuous years on the Moruva Exam-
iner he established the Cobargo Watch, and later
the Bega Budget. While he was engaged on the last,
writer’s cramp so affected him that he completely
lost the use of his right hand and arm. Though an
old man by this time, he refused to give in ; in less
than two months he was writing, as fluently, and,
to the joy of his compositors, much more legibly,
with his left wing.
“Two Seas” : Re the danger of fastening the names
of real people on to fictional characters. A more
curious coincidence than any of those related by
“Ex-Englishman” (B. 10/7/’24) may be found in the
back files of The Bulletin. In one of Henry
Lawson’s yarns was a character whose financial opera-
tions were not above suspicion. Apparently Henry
thought that this imaginary Jeremy Diddler could
safely be named Smellitscheek. But one agent who
bore that cognomen turned up, and wrathfully de-
manded an apology, which was cheerfully tendered.
“Jerphlin”: Tottenham, on the outermost fringe
of the N.S.W. wheat belt, has had a newspaper tor
years, the Peer, issued by one J. J. Paterson ; but
it. has ceased to exist. Paterson managed to get
out a creditable sheet, considering that he was his
own editor, compositor, repo: ter, copy-boy, news-
runner and printer. Before he put the last “dis” in
he sapg his swan song: “It is the only paper that
ever was or ever will be published in Tottenham;
the burg has every prospect of becoming a, one-
horse town, or goat-run, and rather than waste any
more time we make our exit.”
“Bandicoot”: The selection of Mrs. E. F. Allan
as substitute delegate to the League of Nations
Assembly to be held at Geneva in September is a
compliment to Inkywavfarers as well as to the sex.
Mrs. Allan, who has been conducting the admirable
women’s section of the Argus since 1908, is one of
the pioneer woman lawyers and journalists of Aus-
tralasia. After she had completed a brilliant college
and ’varsity course a special act of the M.L. Parlia-
ment was necessary to allow her to be called to the
Bar as the first woman practitioner. Later on her
appearance in the press gallery of the Parliament
caused a sensation, and there was a special sitting
of the debates committee of the House over it.
“Uramao”: “Cosmopolitan’s” reference to Harold
Williams, foreign and dominions editor of the Times
(B. 19/6/’24), reminds me that Harold’s dad has also
been on the Inky Way. He is the Rev. W. J. Wil-
liams, retired Methodist parson, now of Sumner,
Christchurch (M.L.). But his literary guns have
been mostly used for lobbing shells into Bung’s
trenches and upholding John Wesley. For years he
was editor of the Vanguard, Prohibition organ of
Maoriland, from which he has now resigned, but he
still edits the Methodist. Harold’s mother is dead,
but his father re-married, the second wife being
Sister Annie, a church deaconess, who declaims from
the pulpit with more force than many a masculine
expounder of the Word.
“Ivnib”: The acquisition of Melbourne Punch by
the Herald looks like a sort of retribution for the
temporary deposition of Sam Winter slightly over
30 years ago. In the early ’nineties a crowd con-
nected with the late lamented Daily Telegraph
acquired a controlling interest in the Herald, and
for a time a brother of the former owner of Punch
was business manager and parson Fitchett was editor.
Winter meanwhile marked time in the office of his
hobbv journal, the Sportsman. A little before the
two evening papers, the Herald and the Standard,
amalgamated in October, 1894, Winter was restored
to his former throne. What the Herald will do
with Punch now it has got it remains to he seen,
but if it proves as good a property as the Weekly
Times (originally an adjunct of the Daily Tele-
graph) the directors will have reason to shake hands
with themselves.
“M.D.”: It must be Wembley that has awakened
foreigners to the possibilities of Australia. The
first long article on the Commonwealth that 1 remem-
ber to have ever seen in a prominent Italian
review appeared in the April number of the
best of > them, Nuova Antologia, an enthusi-
astic account of the wonders of Australia written
by Attolio Barela. After a long survey of his
subject the writer concludes that “L’Australta e
la terra dell ’ awenire” (Australia is the country of
the future). All the cities come in for commendation,
the only note of sadness being occasioned ,by a Sun-
day spent in Australia’s “Holy City”—Melbourne
in this ease. There are some amusing misprints,
but the text is good, and the illustrations of Mosman
Bay, a cattle station, an artesian well, Sydney Uni-
versity, etc., are first-class. Wat.son-’s Bay is
“l’meantevole Watson Bay.”
“FY7”: Touching newspaper spoof-scoops (B.
5/6/’24), I can recall a famous example in Queens-
land about 40 years ago. R. G. (“Dick”) Newton
was the author. Tremendous interest was being
taken in the possibilities of the frozen-moat trade,
then in its infancy. Newton went one better than
everything that had been written on the subject, with
a circumstantial account in the Queenslander of an
entirely new process for suspending animation in
cattle, and reviving them after a period of hiberna-
tion. The habit of bears and other animals was
gravely quoted. The sheep or cattle, it was ex-
plained, would be driven on board ship and anima-
tion suspended. At their port of destination they
would be reawakened and driven off, having cost
nothing for food, etc. The weird tale was un-
believably successful, trade journals taking it at face
value all over the world, the Yanks biting especially
hard.
“Lex”: The practice of bringing and defending
libel actions has taken the place of subsidising
musical comedies as the last word in extravagance.
The musical comedy could always be taken off:
there is a type of libel suit that can’t be stopped.
Smith’s Weekly lately published a eulogy of Justice
James of N. S. Wales. His remarks during the
Bishop case had been an “encouragement” and an •
“inspiration,” and had consoled the directors for
the expenditure of £7OOO (most of it irrecoverable)
in costs. Hardly had these kind words appeared
when it was announced that the plaintiff was relying
on at least one observation from the Bench to
provide him xvith a new trial. A case of “Save us
from our Judges! ” if ever there was one. Emanuel
Mverson, who also grapples with the same sheet,
appears to look on “the vindication of his honor” in
the same spirit as a British millionaire regards the
upkeep of a steam yacht or the renting of a deer
forest in Scotland —as a pleasure as well as a social
duty. Sportsmen of this class know wavs to make
litigation practically interminable ; and their friends
of the legal profession are in hearty accord with
them. If I were a newspaper proprietc*', an! had
a really resolute litigant on my track, 1 would not
brief eminent K.C.’s like Long Innes and Watt. 1
would select the most incompetent junior, and 1
would get him and his advising attorney drunk on
the morning of the trial. I would give evidence in
person that the plaintiff was a man of the highest
character, and bribe one or more of the jurors to
stand out for at least £5OO damages. The matter
having been thus ended beyond all possibility of
an appeal, motion for a fresh trial or what not, I
would invite my late enemy to dinner and have a
notice put up in the office mentioning that
anyone responsible for printing his name except in
terms of praise would be sacked. It might not be
in accordance with the best traditions of the press,
but it would certainly save me a deal of money.

(e) The Report on “The Petroleum Possibilities of the Taranaki Proyncial Distnct gew Ze.Ua id,
dated 23rd February, 1924, by Mr. Frederick G. Clapp, B.Sc., F.G.S.A., ol 30 Lnurcn atiett,
and for tlm purpose' of developing, .by the adoption of modern technological
and business methods the production of oil on a commercial scale fiom the pop e*
so to be acquired, and which have been reported on by Mr. Clapp.
These properties are situated in the Taranaki. Provincial District, New Zealand,
in the vicinity of New Plymouth and Tarata respectively.
New Plymouth is a port capable of accommodating ships up to six thousand tons,
and is distant about 1140 miles from Sydney and 1420 from Melbourne. For purposes
of comparison it may be stated that the distance by water from Adelaide to Sydney
is 1075 miles, and from Melbourne to Fremantle 1660 miles. Tarata is situated inland
about 15 miles from New Plymouth, with which it is connected by an excellent macadam
road *The history of the Taranaki Oilfields, which may be known to many, records con-
siderable expenditure and spasmodic effort extended over many years, but no commercial
success, though, notwithstanding the unsystematic and unscientific methods hitherto fol-
lowed, production from certain wells near New Plymouth has, it is stated, amounted to
over 60,000 barrels of crude petroleum. . ~ xT
The present venture is based, inter alia, on a portion of this old New I lymouth
oilfield, and a relatively large area of unprospected territory selected by Mr. Clapp,
situated near Tarata, some fifteen miles distant from New Plymouth, and about B_oo
acres in extent. , . , . „ ,
The royalty payable on oil raised from the properties to he acquired is 2/6 a ton
in respect of certain lands, and five per cent, of the value of the flow in other cases, the
whole of which royalty will go to the owners and/or lessors of the various properties
involved.
The Promoters of the present Company put forward this venture as an
attractive one, specifically on the report of Mr. Frederick G. Clapp, B.Sc.,
F G.S.A., whose wide experience and high credentials sufficiently attest its value
and the importance of the conclusions arrived at, by him after field investiga-
tions and a review of the information available from Government reports,
well logs and facts gathered from other sources.
As evidencing the outstanding position which Mr. Clapp holds in the oil world, it
may be mentioned that in 1912 he was commissioned by the Dominion Government of
Canada to report fully on the Petroleum and Natural Gas Resources of Canada. In
1923 he figured as one of the two independent and disinterested authorities appointed
by the United States Senate to investigate and pronounce judgment on certain moot
points connected with oil-distribution and drainage in the now famous Naval Reserve
Oilfield, Teapot Dome, in Wyoming, U.S.A.
An arrangement already made with Mr. Clapp provides for his acting as Consultant
to the Company. An experienced Field Geologist, selected bv Mr. Clapp, and engaged
to study under his direction the detailed geology of the district, has arrived from
the United States, and has taken up his duties in New Zealand. An expert Boring
Superintendent, with an Assistant versed in the up-to-date methods now practised in
U.S.A., has also been engaged, and has arrived in the Dominion.
Mr. Clapp’s Report, which can be seen at the Head Office of the Company, is too
voluminous for publication in extenso, but the following extracts will be read with keen
interest, especially by those- who have long sought for reasons why the possibilities of the
geographically well situated Taranaki area have never been fully developed.
NOTE. —In reading these extracts it should be clearly understood that when Mr.
Clapp speaks of the New Plymouth Oilfield he refers to the particular area in which
are situated the wells which have produced oil, and when lie mentions the Taranaki
area or district he refers to a large stretch of country embracing the New Plymouth
Oilfield, the unprospected area selected by himself and other possible oil-bearing areas.
In a chapter of the Report dealing with the district under consideration, Mr. Clapp
writes (Extract from Article 1) :
“As in the vicinity of all productive oilfields in the world, large areas here” (i.e., in
the Taranaki Provincial District) “are unpromising for commercial deposits of petroleum; but
in certain restricted localities the geological structure, associated with surface seepages of
natural gas, give conditions that appear favorable. These restricted areas may each be several
square miles in extent, and may thereby amount to a relatively large area in the aggregate.”
Commenting on the general Geologic Structure, he writes (Extract from Article 8) :
“Summarising, the general geologic structure” (i.e., of the Taranaki Provincial District)
“consists essentially of a westward or south-westward dipping monocline, at the western edge
of which the volcanic activity has occurred in the past. . Between the easternmost dykes or
plugs known, lying just east of Wanganui Stream, and the eastern border of the basin is an
interval of 50 miles, which leaves plenty of room for many geological structures if they exist,
any one of which may contain petroleum in commercial quantities if the structure be suitable.”
Regarding the area comprising the old New Plymouth Oilfield, he writes (Extract
from Article 14) :
“Summarising, I can find no proof of the existence of deep-seated anti-clinal structure
adjoining the Sugar Loaves, although certain facts indicate the possible existence of such struc-
ture for a few hundred feet outward from the igneous mass. The desirability of drilling a well
to test the area between Taranaki No. 3 well and the Sugar Loaves is based on (1) the fact
that the intervening' area has never been tested over 1100 feet deep ; (2) the excellent showings
of oil in these shallow wells; (3) the proximity to the Breakwater seepages; and (4) the fact
that the dyke or plug must form a pocket in any porous strata that may exist below ground.”
Referring to the Tarata area, situated some fifteen miles from the above and not
far from Inglewood, he writes (Extract from Article 1.4) :
“From what is now known there appears to be a dome or nose centering somewhere within
a distance of two miles north-west of Tarata. Whereas the normal south and west dips of
the region are commonly only from 1 to 5 degrees, the abnormal dips in the Waitara area are
3 to 15 degrees, with the maximum intensity towards the eaVt. The configuration of the Tarata
structure can only be accurately determined by detailed instrumental geological work. Whether
the structure be a dome or a nose, it is a type commonly found and drilled in the oilfields of
Ohio and Oklahoma, in the United States, and deserves testing if no more perfect structure can
be found after studying the entire Taranaki structural basin in great detail. Thus, in addition
to having suitable structure, the area just west of Tarata is the centre of the best and most
numerous natural gas seepages known in Taranaki. The analyses of some of them are given
in Article 10, Table VI, and correspond closely with the composition of natural gas associated
with oilfields in some parts of the world.”
In a chapter of tlie Report headed “Important Factors Considered, Mr. Clapp
writes (Extract from Article 18) : ... .
“Most previous considerations of the petroleum possibilities of Taranaki have emphasised
the fact that only semi-commercial quantities of petroleum were found there and that no well
has ever proved a commercial success, although a number of companies have been organised at
various times for development of the field. It is also usually explained that water is mixed
with the oil ; that the wells have become clogged with sediment, paraffin and tools, sd that they
never produced to their fullest capacity, are now dead, and that deep drilling will be necessary
to obtain the greater quantities of oil that some persons believe exist below the oil horizons
tapped to date. The general opinion has been that the New Plymouth petroleum owes its
existence to distillation under the influence of the Sugar Loaves igneous intrusion (dyke or plug)
and that no oil is to be expected at points removed from such activity. 1 am unable to agree
with all of the above-mentioned points of view or to derive an unfavorable point of view from
them ; because, offsetting the supposedly unfavorable factors are the following, which .may be
considered as offering a probability that petroleum can now be obtained commercially in
• “1. No wells in the New Plymouth field are known to have been systematically pumped. All
of the wells have fallen into disuse and neglect, or been abandoned whenever the flow became
small enough to discredit their commercial success. Such practice is not indulged in in
most oilfields.
“2. So far as I can learn, no well has been cleaned out, although in the oilfields of the world
it is a recognised necessity to clean wells frequently, or whenever they appear to be clogged
by falling rock, by natural cementation, or by paraifining.
“3. No well in the field has ever been ‘steamed,’ although the wells are high in paraffin content,
although in such cases in other fields the paraffin frequently clogs the pores of the sands,
and after a time prevents flowing, so that steaming or shooting is necessary to open new
crevices, in which oil may again reach the tubing of the well.
“4. Since wells in the field are known to have been abandoned owing to the loss of certain
drilling and fishing tools general inefficiency appears to have been the custom. Although tools
are frequently lost temporarily in wells, it is not usual for this practice to proceed to the
extreme to which it has gone at New Plymouth. Losses of tools should be an incident in
the operations that should be speedily overcome by competent handling.
“5. Out of the wells in the field, only the Blenheim appears to have been drilled properly, so
that the others may be considered as practically non-extant from the standpoint of actually
demonstrating whether the oil was in commercial quantity.
“6. Although salt water did and does occur in some of the wells, much of the water at present
contained in the sands is fresh, having descended along the casing from strata at lesser
depths ; thus the water would not probably interfere with the production from wells properly
drilled, packed and cased. Some of the fresh water may have entered the oil sand--. but. I
do not consider it probable that enough will have entered to ruin the field, if oil still
exists in the sands in quantity.
“7. The longest-lived well in the field is apparently Taranaki No. 3, at the western end. of
the field, from which oil still flows in small quantity at weekly intervals, and near to which
gas bubbles to the surface through crevices formed in the drilling operations. This well is
situated only a few hundred feet from what appears to be the south and east boundary of
the Sugar Loaves igneous mass. The intervening distance between No. 3 and the Sugar Loaves
is what may he the most favorable geologically of any part of the field, and has never been
drilled more than 1100 feet deep (see Wells Nos. 2 to 6, Table VII). These wells have
some of the best showings found at any shallow depth in the field, were situated, near
important oil seepages in the sea (see No. 2, Table HI), and hence the desirability ]of
drilling in the interval between No. 3 and the Breakwater for a fair test of any remaining
oil deposit.
“8. If petroleum be present in that portion of Taranaki east of the railway which runs through
Inglewood and Stratford, the deposits may be expected several hundred feet, and possibly over
a thousand feet, closer to the surface than at New Plymouth, on account of the general
east and north-east rise of the strata in the intervening area.
“9. It is contrary to the principles of oil geology to assume that the oil produced to date at
New Plymouth is all that will he found in the Taranaki Basin. As a matter of fact, most
regions in which petroleum is found are far removed from igneous intrusions, and in only
a few places in the world has igneous activity occurred in the past that appears to have
possibly assisted in the formation of petroleum. It is much more common to find large
deposits of oil far removed from igneous masses than near to them ; therefore I am of
opinion that the remainder of Taranaki may offer more chance of finding commercial oil
deposits than did the New Plymouth locality.”
Mr. Clapp recommends ( inter alia) (Extracts from Article 15) :
“That an additional attempt be made, by scientific and technical procedure, to discover
petroleum in Taranaki.”
“That certain areas be acquired for drilling where geological conditions are the most
favorable.”
“That tests be drilled where the geological structure is suitable, based on the conditions now
known, supplemented by the detailed work recommended below.”
That one of the tests, 3500 feet deep if necessary, be. drilled north-west of Taranaki Petroleuni
Company’s Well No. 3 in the New Plymouth field, to determine whether or not petroleum exists in
greater quantity nearer the dyke or plug and trapped by it.”
. “That a second test be drilled on the structure mentioned in the last part of Article 14 (i.e. ■
near Tarata), or on a still more favorable structure if such be found in detailed geological work.”
“That if oil be found in commercial quantity in either of the first two wells, other wells be
then drilled in succession on such favorable structures as may be mapped or be contiguous to good
wells.”
He points to tlie big scope offered by tlie district for further close investigational
work, and stresses the advisability of bringing from U.S.A. an experienced Field Geologist,
with an Assistant, to study the detailed geology under his (Mr. Clapp’s) direction.
This, as stated in the Prospectus, has already been done, and the necessary steps
will be taken with all possible despatch to give effect to the above recommendations.
In conclusion, Mr. Clapp writes (Extract from Article 191 :
“This report may be summed up by (1) calling attention to the considerations mentioned in
Article 18. viz., that neither the investigation or development of Taranaki’s petroleum resources
has been heretofore undertaken by the method and system generally followed in modern oil
development; (2) by referring to the existence of what promises to be favorable geological structure,
described by Article 14 ; and (3) again expressing my belief that since oil of high grade exists in
a seemingly unfavorable geological situation at New Plymouth, more oil exists in other parts of
the great sedimentary basin on more definite structures, susceptible of discovery by detailed
geologic work,' and which will, not be handicapped in their oil possibilities by the existence of
volcanic intrusions.
“The question of whether petroleum actually exists in commercial quantity m any region
can only be ascertained by the drill, and proper tests have not yet been made in Taranaki. The
best that can be said now is that conditions are favorable, not only for occurrence, but for the
technicalities of development and for the establishment of the industry if petroleum be found
commercially anywhere in the district.”

“Faust” made the popular hit
ot the Sydney season of grand opera thus
tar. Even the least musical know some
tragments of the score; and with Melba
billed as the much-tempted Marguerite, and
Borgioli as the elderly Faust who sold his
soul for what a monkey-gland or one good
draught of Voronoff might do for him to-day,
the wild enthusiasm _ Her Majesty’s was
a foregone conclusion. The chorus, especi-
ally the ladies, put in good work, and the
ballet in the second act filled the market-
place with a gay crowd of lads aid lasses
who romped like kittens in the moonlight.
Di Lelio made a sonorous Mepliisto, and,

judging by the efforts that two able-bodied
men put into the netting of one young girl’s
soul. What is harder still to understand is how
the flaming gentleman, with penny squibs
bursting from his finger-tips, wasn’t arrested
by the village constable. As for Borgioli,
the Devil may have given him back his
youth, but he didn’t include the flower of
his beauty in the transaction. On the other
hand, the voice was everything and more
than it has heretofore been. The French

Scavizzi and Granforte snatched victorv
from the teeth of Death in the two tragedies,
“Cavalleria Rusticana” and “I Pagliacci,”
that are always Siamesed together, Heaven
alone knows why. The casts in both were
the most even Sydney has so far seen;
nevertheless, the vivid acting of Scavizzi in
“Cavalleria” and of Granforte in the other
leaped out of the frame. As Santuzza Sca-
vizzi wore her sorrow with dignity—she
was never woebegone. Though hands and
eyes were eloquent of hopeless misery, she
acted and sang with artistic discretion. Pic-
caluga was forceful and tuneful as Turidd i,
tlie roaming lover; and Grandini as Alfio
was impressive and melodic in his contempt
ror the home-wrecker. Vida Sutton made a
ightweight Mama Lucia, though her voice
met the small requirements, and Doris Mc-
lnnes as the naughty Lola put the right
amount of audacity into that part. Gran-
tor i;es lonio was a very fine bit of acting
and facial expression. His portrayal of the
Half-witted clown enamored of Nedda was
masterly, not to say heart-breaking. Aurora
Kettore sang sweetly and was altogether
charming as Nedda; and Marques made an
arresting Canio, simulating anguish that was
very close to tears in both voice and acting.
Antonio Laffi as Silvio, the gentleman far-

as the Harlequin were melodic punctuations

One or two art shows:—
H. van Raalte’s reputation as an etcher will be
enhanced by his show at the Fine Art Society’s

three or four are below his standard. In two of
them, figure studies (Nos. 10 and 26), he is guilty
of ineffective portraiture; but No. 23 is technically
mdictible because it is not a successful combination
of drypoint and aquatint. The effort is wanting in
harmony and balance; the big foreground tree rZr.o-
polises the attention. But in other prints, wherein
the needle is the servant of his imagination, his
art is serenely beautiful, One cannot ask for ahV-

Adelaide drew a fine line with regard to Norman
Lindsay s etchings sent across for the current Artists’
Meek The picture-exhibition is held in the Society of
Ai ts Gallery, lent for the occasion under a rule which
gives the lenders power of inspection and veto. Eight
of the Lindsay pictures were passed for exhibition;
put the Society exercised its veto over “The Festival ”
The Apex of Life” and “The Funeral March of
Don Juan,” explaining that it did so “not because of
the quality of execution, but solely on account of
the subject matter, and considering it not in the
public interest to allow these three to be displayed.”
Of course that didn’t end the matter. Lindsay
promptly withdrew his other exhibits; and within 18
hours word was sent through that probably all Sydney
exhibits would be withdrawn—it was even suggested
that Adelaide would be brushed out of existence so far
as at least one important Sydney art group was con-
cerned. At this point Dame Melba saw her chance to
wipe off a score against Adelaide, which on her recent
visit treated her very coldly—even hinted that it was
more interested in its own new orchestra than in
any Italian Grand Opera co. “Pouf!” said the
scornful Dame, apropos Adelaide’s new outburst; and
the S.A. capital was expected to feel that it had been
blown off the map.

The Robert Greig season, at Adelaide
Royal, was not as well patronised as it de-
served. It gave good plays (always except-
ing Baby Mine,” with which Greig mis-
takenly opened), the acting was good, and
by the time a farewell was said with the well-
worn _ Message from Mars” the public was
beginning to take notice. Greig himself was
the Messenger, and Richard Webster much
increased his reputation by his work in this
play and in “Officer 666.’” A strong variety

OUTWARDLY two motor cars may
appear the same. But similarity in
appearance does not signify that the service
of each car will be the same. For real
satisfaction in an automobile depends upon
the quality of materials and workmanship
used in its construction. And these impor-
tant factors must penetrate the very heart of
the car.
In making Studebaker cars, for example, Fine
Appearance must be matched by Fine Per-
formance. And to ensure the latter, we em-
ploy only the best materials and workmanship.
Such qualities, while not always perceptible to
the eye, are important. They are responsible
for the complete satisfaction that Studebaker
owners receive from their cars.
On many steel alloys we pay 15% extra to
secure better than average grades. Thus
we provide matchless strength for vital parts.
Not steel alone, but all other raw materials
are selected according to rigid specifications.
All must bd approved by Studebaker labora-
tories in which 500,000 tests are made annually.
We machine our crankshafts on all surfaces.
This costs us £120,000 per year. But the
added cost is justified because it practically
eliminates vibration in Studebaker engines.
We use Timken bearings liberally—because
they are adjustable and wear longer than
ordinary bearings.
We employ 1200 men to give 32,000 inspec-
tions to every Studebaker car in the making
—this to safeguard our high standards of
quality.
These are but a few of the hidden qualities
incorporated in Studebaker cars—but they
are typical of the policy Studebaker has
followed for 72 years in the building of
quality vehicles.

The FOUR TESTS of an ASSURANCE COMPANY
THE nature of Life Assurance, the fact that it constitutes a promise of
payment to your wife, child or dependant at a critical period of their
lives, demands the unshakable stability of the Company issuing it.
The following four tests reveal the unassailable position of the Producers &
Citizens’ Life Assurance Co. of Australia, Limited.
FOUNDATION.—The Producers & Citizens’ is based on a solid rock of the
primary producer—the backbone of the community, and on whom the very
existence of the country depends. By its agreements with the leading
Farmer and Grazier Co-operative bodies in each State the Producers &
Citizens is linked with the most substantial section of the community.
G. L. WEAVER, Managing Director.
VOLUME.—-For a Company of similar age, the Producers & Citizens’
created an Australian record during the past three years by writing Five
million pounds of new business. J s

“T. 0.1.”: H. R. Harwood was managing
the Melbourne Royal when Maggie Moore,
with her first husband, J. C. Williamson,
arrived in the latter part of 1874. Asked to
produce “Struck Oil,” he objected that
Emmett and others had “worked out the
Dutchy business,” and that the salaries pro-
posed were excessive. “Well, will you share
the house and expenses?” asked Maggie. Har-
wood was agreeable, and the bargain was
made. “Struck Oil” ran for six weeks,
crowds being turned away. I still retain
a memory of Harwood biting his nails
moodily at the sight of money being rejected
at the box-office.
“Thersites”: “Hamfat” (B. 17/7/'24)
suggests th|it small-part men are overpaid at
£0 a week. But the small parts are as im-
portant, relatively, as the leads. I know a
fine play in which the act ends with
“Dinner is served,” the entire “part” of a
footman ; and another, by Sardou, in which
the tensest situation in the drama is created
by a servant announcing, “The lamp!” Such
parts simply have to be played by experi-
enced mummers. I question “Hamfat’s”
assertion that small-part performers are en-
gaged at other callings in the daytime. His
sunshine canvassers who are actors at
night—when do they rehearse? A rehearsal
begins, usually, at 10 or 10.30 a.m., and may
last all day—it certainly lasts till 1 o’clock—
and the small-part, one-line man must be
there all the time in case his scene is re-
peated. Then there are matinees. Many
a decent actor nowadays counts himself
lucky if he gets three months’ work in the
year. For the other nine months he doesn’t
know enough about any game, even can-
vassing, to earn,tram fares.
“Norbell” : Have actors got brains?** asks
“First Old Man” (B. 17/7/’24). If they
had they wouldn’t be actors, is the obvious
answer. The producer wants automata
who will carry the costumes around and re-
produce his monkey-tricks accurately and
mechanically. And as the producer is not
a creative artist, but merely the tradesman
who has to interpret the author in terms of
the theatre —well, we get the kind of shows
we do get. Just as the Diggers were “no
soldiers” to the brass-hat whose bible was
the little red book, so the Australian mum-
mers are “bad actors” as soon as they at-
tempt a little unconventionality and sincerity
in their work. You “cross right,” “cross
left,” “go up,” “get left C,” “sit,” “stand,”
“laugh,” “cry” or “sneer” with parade-
ground exactness. But if you dare to ex-
Inbit a gleam of intelligent anticipation,
initiative or understanding, you are the
“wrong type,” and out you go.
“Phil Pillface”: Jack Dunne, the second
juvenile in “Good Morning, Dearie,” at Syd-
ney Royal, w r as a buyer for Hoffnung’s, the
Sydney importers, before he went on the
stage. A versatile young man who can
always be relied upon at a pinch, he once
played Popoff in “The Merry Widow” at a
matinee, and at night Nisch. In “Sally” he
took three different parts on consecutive
evenings. Paddington (N.S.W.) claims him
as a son, and his favorite recreations are
surfing and composing at the piano.
“Yarra Ben”: “The Wheel” did not go
round for long at Melbourne Palace. Of all
the plays served up during the last decade it
had the worst first night, and a production
rarely rallies after a bad start. Barbara
Hoffe has had an unlucky experience in Aus-
tralia. Laid aside by illness as soon as she
landed, she was prevented from taking the
parts she was “up” in ; and then she had to
study two long and trying characters in
pieces which nobody was anxious to see.
“C.M.”: Although a relative like “Gina”
(B. 17/7/’24) should be an authority, all
Wilde’s biographies give his full name as
Oscar Fingal O’Flahertie Wills Wilde. He
dropped the three extra names as he became
better known. Frank Harris tells a story about
coming across some verses which Wilde had
contributed, years before, to his college maga-
zine, and noticing that the Signature was
“Oscar O’Flahertie Wilde.” Asking in a
joking way what the O’Flahertie stood for,
the poet replied reproachfully that he had
a right to the name, as a descendant of the
O’Flalierties who had been kings in Ireland
when the English kept themselves warm with
tattooings. And Wilde’s certificate of Free-
masonry, dated December 20, 1876, invites
COULDN’T TELL HIS HANDICAP TILL HE PLAYED.
MUSICIAN: "And how much would he the rent of this room with the use of the piano?”
LANDLADY : “I couldn’t say just straight away—you see we haven’t heard you yet.”
everyone to know that “our excellent brother,”
of all four Christian names, is “au expert
master,” etc.
“Orb”: Americo Gagliardi, the flautist of
the Grand Opera Co., was with Nellie
Stewart in Maoriland. Sweet Nell tells in
her “Life's Story” how he was missing one
night in Dunedin, and how the Hops and
Sleuths of that respectable city searched for
him unavailingly for days after he had re-
turned to his orchestral job. She doesn’t
mention his name, but the cherubic Americo
himself reminded me of the incident the other
day.
“Ellae” : Seymour Hicks, when delivering
his election address in “Old Bill, M.P.,”
makes it plain that the persons on the stage
are his whole audience. In my judgment, a
better effect could be produced by speaking
direct to the people in the auditorium, there-
by roping them in as “buckshee” supers, and
arranging for interruptions to come from
somewhere near the orchestra. The few
actors needed in the scene might be grouped
about Bill’s platform. Which reminds me
that when Allan Wilkie did “Henry V.” in
Sydney he called to the breach an army so
unimpressive that a scornful schoolboy voice
declared its ability to make a better one “out
of ebooks in my back yard.” A stage picture
of Henry, solus, urging on a continuous line
of spears and shields from a mound or pile
of stones would have been far more convinc
ing than that of Henry encouraging an
“army” which painfully recalled Smike and
another gentleman going on as a General
Rebellion. The half-forgotten art of “sug-
gesting” a crowd might be revived with pro-
fit, now that supers are so expensive.
“Norman H.”: There is an old chap in the
Dunwich (Q.) home for the aged and in-
firm who says he played Silvio in “I Pagli-
acci” before Royalty, shortly after the first
production in London. Other grand-opera
parts he claims to have taken are Alfio in
“Cavallei’ia Rusticana,” Valentine in “Faust,”
Count de Luna in “Trovatore,” Mazette in
“Don Giovanni,” Count Arnheim in “The
Bohemian Girl,” and Don Jose in “Maritana.”
According to his story, he sang at the Christ-
church (M.L.) Exhibition in 1906. with
Alfred Hill’s orchestra, returning to London
to appear in “Dorothy.” But he had devel-
oped bronchial asthma, and during the run of
“Dorothy” this complaint became so bad that
liis voice left him for ever. Can any Pointer
identify him from the description, or is it all
imagination?
“C. Ockney”: Once an actor always an
actor. When the last mail left England
Robert Courtneidge, who played several parts
in Australia before he became one of
Britain’s most successful managers, was
making his re-appearance as a mummer in
“On Change” at the Grand Opera House,
Leicester, a theatre which he had recently
acquired. It was Bobbie’s first appearance
on the English stage since he toured with
Kate Vaughan in 1894; but, unless my
memory is playing tricks, he was briefly seen
in one of the comedies he brought to this
country four years ago.
“Abbot P.” : Discovered an old volume the
other day—“ The Musical Gem,” published in
1835 by “Mori and Lavenu, New Bond-street,
London.” Lavenu, who married Mori’s
daughter, eventually came to Sydney, where
he died in 1859. The old book has an en-
graving of Rubini, then the “King of
Tenors.” He had a falsetto top storey which
captivated contemporary composers. Hence
the abnormally high tenor parts in operas
like “La Sonnambula,” which in these days
are sung three or four notes lower than
Rubini took them.
“Caesar's Ghost” : When a child in England
I met Elgar, the composer (B. 10/7/’24) ;
an uncle with whom I stayed was his neigh-
bor at Malvern, where “The Dream of Geron-
tius” was written. Elgar’s wife had a
passion for music equal to his own, though
she lacked her husband’s genius. Their one
child, a girl, was left very much in the charge
of a nurse, who amused herself by scaring the
hapless mite. A prey to curious fancies, the
lonely little girl one day sped fearfully from
the garden and said the clouds had opened and
God had spoken to her; to which the nurse
merely replied that she was “a fearful little
linn.” _ Even as a kid, the lot of that imagina-
tive infant, with her musically-absorbed
parents, struck me as pathetic; and often,
when I hear Elgar’s music or of his increas-
ing fame, I wonder what became of her.
“X.N.0.”: Talking of grand opera (and
who in Sydney isn’t?), I only once saw an
audience completely overwhelmed with laugh-
ter during a tragic death scene. It: took
place at the Opera House at Malta before
the Chevalier de Lancelotti became impres-
ario. The opera was Mascagni’s “Iris,”
and the heroine committed suicide by throw-
ing herself over a precipice. What we saw
in the next scene was the corpse of the lady
lying at the foot of the cliff among what the
directions called “the growing flowers.” This
had been literally interpreted: the flowers
grew under one’s eyes. The method em-
ployed involved a series of very small hinged
trapdoors, about two inches square, being
cut in the stage. One suddenly opened and
fell back with a click. Through the hole
was thrust a bunch of dirty artificial flowers
Another trap opened with a click somewhere
else and another bunch came up, and by the
time an overworked stagehand had ' been
responsible for about 20 clicks and 20
bunches of flowers, the audience, composed
almost entirely of British officers and their
wives, was nearly in hysterics.
“Verri”: Died recently in Auckland,
Joseph Newzil, organ-grinder, goldminer
sailor, curio-dealer and one-time proprietor of
a Sydney picture-theatre, a venture that was
a great unsuccess. Newzil, an old Bohe-
mian, was well known around Auckland
where a host of kindly people regularly
dropped pennies into his collecting-box. The
old man died comparatively well off, and, in
addition to a few family and charitable be-
quests, remembered all his friends in his will
His landlady was bequeathed a house lie
owned, and almost every benefactor got some-
thing—even to those who had given the old
organ-grinder a cup of tea.
“Cat” : Touching the statement that Gerald
Griffin is an American (B. 17/7/’24), Griffin
told me, on his last visit, that he was born
in Co. Mayo, and emigrated when a lad.
.T.F.H. (Lond.) : Talking to a London
reporter, who described him as “one of the
makers of modern Australia,” and “a man
of great vision and wealth,” Hugh D.
Mclntosh had a go at “the too-prevalent type
of American film which ridicules British
ideals and standards.” The Mclnstoush is
appalled at “the evil influence exerted by
films of that sort on the young people of Aus-
tralia,” which films, it seems, are “very un-
pleasant”—albeit “very” is an adverb and
‘ pleasant” an adjective which “Hugh D.”
rarely uses unless he has run out of terser
expressions. Convinced that Something Will
Have to Be Done, Mclntosh has a plan for
"guaranteeing an output .of suitable pictures
m which the ideals of the British peoples
will no longer be held up to ridicule—the
making on a big scale of British Empire
films with a world-wide appeal.” No particu-
lars are furnished, so the plan cannot be
judged. Still, Mclntosh will be assured of
a welcome if he puts money into pictures,
for the British are as weary as the Austra-
lians of Hollywood smut and slop.
Caesar's Ghost”: An incorrigible optimist
is the minor mummer, amalgamations and
the movies notwithstanding. Two I met re-
cently told me that they had the company re-
hearsed, the tour fixed, the scenery ready and
the “paper” printed; in fact, nothing was
wanting except the fares to Bailemup, the
first town on their schedule. Once at Bail-
emup. something could be done, or somebody,
even if it was only the hotelkeeper. Apropos,
an actor, who now has a regular job at a
city theatre, once had ten bob left after
paying his landlady and laundryman “I
know what I'll do,” he exclaimed. “I'li’start
a company.” And he started one—with a
shilling for an advertisement in the S. M.
Herald. It brought him two ambitious ama-
teurs who agreed to pay a premium for stage
experience, and the subsequent tour was a
success.
E-T-’ '• Sardou takes a lot of killing. “La
1 osca in its operatic form still earns a
crust for its producers, and “Diplomacy,” one
of his earliest successes, is again drawing
the crowd in London, where, at the Adelphi,
it has been in the bills since March. The
breach dramatist. may be “old-fashioned” and
artificial, ’ as his detractors maintain, but
Ins stage technique—call it “trick,” if you
will keeps the interest of his audiences alive;
Apropos, Israel Zangwill, in the preface to his
latest play, “The Forcing House,” has this
to say of the long-dead author:—
Ihe name of Sardou, that master of dramatic*
technique, is rarely mentioned nowadays without a
sneer. I used myself to speak of him as a stage-
carpenter. But closer acquaintance with his plats
has convinced me that, although he may sometimes
have divorced incidents from their roots in psycho-
logy ,he w T as as frequently dramatic in the best sense.
And Israel might have added, “I wish I had
the gift!” •
“Mancam”: Emanuel Pugwash had just
won a nickel-plated pencil-case at the Sozzle-
bong eisteddfod for reciting “Lasea,” and
7,® wanted to go on the stage, please.
Ihe Jirm’s pet producer sighed resignedly
when the callow Borneo told of his experi-
ences and his artistic yearnings. “Well,
let s hear you jerk a bit of 'Lasea,' ” he
snapped. Emanuel Pugwash pumped out a
couple of adenoidy lines. “Ring off,” boomed
the producer. “That’s quite enough of animal
impersonations. Now let’s hear you make a
noise like a human being!”
Lud : C. B. Cochran, of the Wembley
Rodeo and half a dozen London theatres,
.again threatens to get out of the show busi-
ness. Only a few months ago he professed
to be so disgusted with the way the critics
treated one of his productions that he vowed
lie d retire, but nobody takes him seriously
or seems in a hurry to acquire his interests.
Cochran has been by turns actor (he toured
with Jefferson in “Rip Van Winkle”), press-
agent, boxing-promoter, circus-proprietor,
music-hall manager and theatre boss; he is a
Sussex man, rising 51, and there was some
talk a while back of his taking Hugh D.
Mclntosh into partnership.
EXIT THE CHORUS GENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The chorus gent, is going, soon he’ll disappear for ever
From our stages,
Where for ages
It has been his fond endeavor
To emulate those singing stars, so grossly overpaid.
While he snorted
“This imported
Talent I’ll put in the shade!”
Oh, the chorus -gent, is going: let us toll a parting
knell,
For where the deuce he’s going to there’s not a
soul can tell.
He has strolled on casually from the wings to take
his cue up,
When a number
Wakes from slumber
The stalls baldheads and they screw up
Op’ra glasses,
For the lass is
Back the pert one, with the million-dollar legs.
While the chorus-
Gent. sonorous
Vainly kind attention begs;
Though the song may be the liveliest, oh his visage
it is grim!
How we’ll miss those classic features when we’ve
said good-bye to him.
Me shall miss him in his “plus-fours,” and his dress-
clothes, and his “blazer.”
On he’d toddle—
Tailor’s model—
To be wasted in the background, though as keen
as any razor,
While limelit principals would sing and think they
were “the show.”
How he stuck it!
Think he’d chuck it
For a decent job ?—oh no !
And now the manager remarks, “You’re fired—get
work!” The churl!
But life’s got its compensations—there is still the
chorus girl!

DEFEATING
The Smoke Terror
HPO venture into the suffocating atmos-
“*■ phere of dense smoke, or the sickly fumes
of foul gases can only be successfully accom-
plished by wearing a perfect Smoke Helmet
such as the Siebe, Gorman Helmet illustrated

This Smoke Helmet has proved to be perfect in
design and construction, giving ample supplies of
fresh air with comfort and safety to the wearer.
In Gas Works, Chemical Works,
Breweries, Fire Brigades, Mines, and

atmospheres are frequently met, this
apparatus defeats the atmospheric
terrors.

CAN YOU DRAW?
You may think you can’t, but really
you can, for if you can write you can
draw; the same principles apply in
each. With the thorough tuition you
receive from the Weston Course, there
is no reason why you should not in-
stantly dash off free, bold sketches
similar to the one above.
THE HARRY J. WESTON
Postal School of Drawing
takes you step by step from the rudiments of
sketching to the highest branches of art.
The lessons are simple, interesting and effi-
cient.
Remember, we teach to DRAW not to COPY.
Learn more about the Course ! Post three
stamps with your name and address, and you
will receive a copy of Mr. Weston’s interest-
ing Booklet —“There’s Money in the Pen’’;
it explains all about the Course.

Rustington: Yes, it was a good cartoon;
but we can't resurrect it H.D.; “The Soil’’ is
too poor. .. .John Stillwater: Short weight....
P.O’F. : Only this cursed lack of space keeps it out.
. ...E.O. (Nambour) ; Doesn’t look as though it was
written for The B. And too much bone and gristle
in it, anyway. We want the marrow.... Hoxton:
Not in a thousand years.. . .T.L.A.: But there is
no question of prosecuting defaulters; they are
simply to lose the service, that’s all. .. . Spunyarn:
Thanks; you are quite right. .. .L.D.G.: Its poor
feet are sore. .. .H.D.: If this will help you to shift
Teddy, you’re welcome:—
We have to have them whether or not,
So says the oracle, and he knows quite a lot;
We in old Queensland now know our fate—
Theodore lias spoken and we shiffer and shake.
He and his party our saviours were to be,
Cheap meat and fish was the bait laid for we;
No out of works, all for a glorious time,
Hell should be Heaven at their bidding sublime.
Queensland is thought to be a somewhat hot shop;
By cripes, we know it, with this double red hot.
Have pity, Bulletin, and give vent to our cry;
Help us shift Teddy and his socialist fry.
.... H.W.: Thin tale told without humor in poor
verse. ... Lem Hand: It didn’t get through before,
and it can’t get through now... .Roma N.: The
yarn doesn't convince; the people are utterly unreal.
H.J.G.; Doesn’t thrill us Redmond D.: Can-
not give opinions by letter. The goods submitted
have no literary quality Set: Poor sort of stuff.
....Gina T.; Misses, but the verse is distinctly not
bad. .. .U.M.C.: Hard to know what all the excite-
ment is about... .1.L.1.: The wool-holding toiler
must go back.... A.R. (South Yarra) : Too unplea-
sant a yarn.... Droftep : Pretty awful A.J.Y. :
Not nearly.... Chalk: Try again; you don’t get
enough out of it... . Gordon M.: The verse isn't
strong enough to carry it... .E.W.G.8.: The charac-
ters are too crudely handled Henry C.: Hardly
point enough for the elaborate machinery that has vo
be imagined Cassin; Your Miss Carter is not for
us... . Thomas D. : The verse is far too rough....
M.8.P. : Doesn’t strike us R.S.A.: The mirth
makes your yarn very heavy, and it is all about
nothing.... Colin G.: The lines are so tired they sag
badly. .. .P.A.M.: Too weak and wobbly.. . .S.S.M.:
An ancient tale badly t01d.... Peter S.: Begins well,
but falls away J.W.D.: Says old things in an
old way. .. . T.D.T.: No yarn there. It is merely a
detailed account of a murder. There isn’t space to
acknowledge pars in this column... .F.J.H.: Doesn't
get near... . Bellerive: “The Whalers” are a glory
and a delight:—
The Whalers, daring Whalers,
Whom plough the frothy deep,
Where the billows wail and dasheth,
And gusty winds doth sweep;
Weather-worn and bearded,
( A tough and fearless band,
Away out from the land;
Whom hunt the spouting monsters,
For trade their lives they risketh
Upon the bounding foam,
While wives and sweethearts trusteth
They’ll returneth safely home.
Daredevils of the ocean,
A tough and fearless band,
Whom hunt the spouting monsters
Away out from the land.
. ...W.E.8.; “Sailor” doesn't make us believe it’s
true. .. . J.E.D. : Nothing to suggest promise....
M.F.T. : Thin and uncertain on its feet 8.M.T.:
Merely chopped prose; and poor of its kind....
Billy S. : Doesn't even get its nose around the corner.
• • •-P.M.H.: Artificial. .. .Bettie R.: Imitative stuff
that does not get to much... .R.D, (Dungog) : You
haven’t made the most of your material J.M.D.:
Very lame. .. .8.H.: “The Stone-age Jazz Party” is
as dull as sawdust Hilda G.: You can do better
than that Squibby; Why not write of the things
you know? You’ve got real information concerning
matters of which most of us are profoundly ignorant;
and then you turn to a subject that thousands of
men know a lot about. Don’t be afraid to talk
shop....M.R. (Austen’s Ferry): That bush girl has
been mishandled in that way too often. We don’t
believe a girl of the type would turn to infan-
ticide .... Hunter C.: Hardly enough general inter-
est. .. .W.E.8.; “Natural Feelings” promised well,
but tailed off. .. .E.J.F.: The verse is a bit too
ragged and the yarn doesn’t hold any mirth
A.K.R.: Gets near, but doesn’t quite arrive....
H.T.R.: Not enough in them. .. .E.J.F.; Not for
this bundle.... Ripponlea: “Orange-pips” deserves to
win its heat in any Olympic contest:—
When the ground is mud and mire,
And underfoot is slop,
I love to sling ’em in the fire,
And hear ’em loudly pop;
For when I’ve ate my eggs and ham,
Old Thirst puts in the nips;
So I eat an orange if I can,
And then I burn the pips.
Crack! Crack! they go
Like a foreign foe
A-firing from its trenches
At me, as so
Within the glow
My fierce thirst I quenches.
But by the time
It’s half-past nine
Most every pip has busted
(Unless, of course,
i’ve hogged the sauce,
Or overdone the mustard).
Kenneth W.: You might find another market for
it.... Clara S.: The verse is not well enough con-
structed .... Edgar M.: The remarks of the horse
are too commonplace.... Hesperian: Not even in the
places where the birds “graze” would such verse
be joyous... .Planter No. 2: It isn’t exciting....
Mark VII.: Fails ; but there is some merit in it....
N.G. (Edington) ; Very commonplace ideas in poor
verse.... G.W.W.: You have guessed the verdict cor-
rectly.... Chicot: Just so-50... .Jakardy: Too like
many others... .Inglenook: Not enough general inter-
est. .. .Nollig: “The Road” left us rather sleepy.
... .Galen: Misses... .Mary M.: The verse hardly
carries it... .G.F.P.: Says nothing except that there
is “no beauty like the Western Hills” and so fails
to make its case g00d... .T.11.C.; It deserved brighter
handling— .8.C.F.: As slight as our acquaintance
with the Shah of Persia... .A.P. (Brisbane): Very
weak flutter.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
W.J.R.: If you are determined to go in for black-
and-white you had better learn drawing... .G.S.:
The dictionary doesn’t hold a suitable adjective... .
J.V.: Hopelessly amateurish... .A.E.: As usual....
J.G.: Nothing in it....E.M.: So many geniuses are
unrecognised, aren’t they ?... .R.D.L.: Pathetically
senile gag... .E.V.F.: Drawing very wobbly in spots.
. ...R.M.: A rank theft... .J.D.: If it was funny
when it left you, the humor leaked out on the way
to us W.T.H.; Below the mark... .K.L.: A
shearer holding a sheep like that would be asking
for the sack. —• —~-

a Beautiful
Rexona Girl
the First Prize
Miss Lilian Owen, of 20 Thornton Street, Manly, winner of the
First Prize of £5OO in 'The Daily Guardian Surf Girl £lOOO
Competition, is a true Rexona Girl and uses only Rexona Soap. She
writes us as follows: —
“I am an enthusiastic Surfer and every morning after my dip
in the Surf I always use Rexona Soap for my shower.
“It keeps the skin and hair in the pink of condition and I
think that is one of the reasons why I won the £5OO First Prize in
‘The Daily Guardian’ Surf Competition.”
Are You Satisfied
with Your Looks?
Be a Rexona Girl
sind Be a Winner, too!
Rexona and Rexona Soap are the Rexona Girl’s
aids to beauty. With their assistance she rids her
skin of blemishes and pimples, keeps her hair and
scalp in such perfect condition that she is the envy
of all her friends. But the Rexona Girl is not
selfish —she does not keep the secret to herself, but
wishes all the world to rejoice with her. Over 5000
girls have written to the Company the glad news
that they are Rexona Girls and find the Rexona Pro-
ducts the most wonderful aids to health and beauty.
They say that Rexona Soap keeps their skin and hair healthy and
beautiful and should be used by every girl who values her good
looks. They say they are always finding new uses for Rexona, the
Rapid Healer and many of their letters contain a photograph which
shows by its beauty that these users are getting the best results in
health and happiness. Are you satisfied with your looks? Why
not become a Rexona Girl, too?

“Ringer”: “Derf Commor” (B. 12/6/’24)
looks on the sunny side of a cane-cutter’s
life. He says thousands leave the southern
cities each year for North Queensland with
visions of cheques up to £ls weekly. I have
cut cane for years, and never once have 1
handled £ls for a week’s work. If I averaged a
trifle less than half of it I was well satis-
fied. I am at present cutting in D 1135 cane
and cannot make £1 a day, and out of that
tucker has to come. Shearing at £2 a hun-
dred is a 100 p.c. better occupation than cut-
ting cane at 10s. a ton.

“H.M.”: A satisfactory batch of immi-
grants arrived by the Benalla the other day
—a group of woollen-workers for the soon-
to-be-opened mills at Goulburn (X.S.WY).
all but two of them girls, and all specialists
in their particular branches. They comprise
the advance guard of the army which some
day will be employed, and on their shoulders
will rest the training of others in a branch
of work which is not quite new to Australia,
but which Australians have still much to
learn about. The new-comers hail from
Bradford.

“H.K.”; The first regular ferry service
betwen Sydney and Manly was started by
Capt. 11. Wilson in the early ’sixties with the
Breadalbane and Phantom. At first the
boats plied on Sundays- only, but Wilson
soon made it a daily business. Four trips a
day were made from the old Queen’s,Wharf;
the single fare was a shilling. A horse tram,
which started from the Ship Inn, Circular
Quay, and ran along Pitt-street to the old
Redfern railway station, had arrived in
1860.
* * * *
“Kirk”: Someone recently boosted liis axe-
handles made from silver-wattle. I’ve never
had any axe-handles of this timber, but if I
want a slash-hook handle or a hammer- or
pick-handle, I always get a sapling of it, and
find that in general it gives good service,
equaling, and sometimes surpassing, Ameri-
can hickory. It is a tree of rapid growth,
and soon reaches maturity. After that the
wood becomes brittle, so for making axe-
handles trees about 12 years old should prove
most suitable. But if our axemen feel they
must have hickory, why not start planting it
here? There should be money in it, with axe-
handles selling at 4s. each.
* * * •
(( “Pestle”: “Cartot” writes of the law
“which permits grocers as well as chemists
to sell certain medicinal preparations” as if
it were a Federal affair. Actually the laws on
the subject differ widely. In Victoria the most
potent “gland extracts” can only be sold by a
pharmaceutical chemist, and even then the con-
tainer must be labelled: “This preparation is
a potent drug, and care must be exercised
in using it.” In Tasmania chemists have a
monopoly of things medicinal, including
patent medicines. There a grocer dare not
sell even a box of Beecham’s pills if then
is a pharmacy within five miles of his store.
* * * •
“Australian”: “Ex-Englishman” (B.
3/7/'24) can rest assured that Australian
wdiisky is made from the best materials
under the best conditions, and from first to
last is required to conform in the matter
of purity to much more rigid tests than any
other part of the world imposes. Again, every
layman or expert distiller who has frequented
the premises of any Australian distilleries
knows that the standard insisted on by the
department is maintained in ;every particular.
Indeed, the standard of maturity laid down
by patriotic distillers is more than twice
that demanded by the Government. “Ex-
Englishman” is, I fancy, quite correct in
his supposition that the prejudice against
Australian whisky is carefully fostered by
the importers, and he can rest assured that
he will satisfy both his palate and his pocket
if he buys any of the whisky bottled undei
the a?gis of the Australian distiller.
* * * *
“Fitzwilliam” : “F. Clinton’s” Sydney bank
clerk (B. 3/7/’24), who used to swindle the
Stamp Office by placing half-stamps on the
security documents so that an overlap would
cover the swindle, was a smart man. I
have been practising the law for more years
than I care to think of, and ever since the
Stamp Duties Act came into force, over 40
years ago, the N. S. Wales stamp office has
used “impressed” stamps for practically all
purposes. Yon lodge your deed at' the
Stamp Office, pay a duty in cash, and the
deed comes back with a single stamp for
the required amount impressed on the parch-
ment or paper. Apart from the Id. and 2d.
duty stamps used for denoting the excess
duty on demand drafts and receipts, the ad-
hesive stamps are used only for the Is. duty
on “agreements not under seal.” A smart
clerk might make 6d. on two such documents
by using a stamp and a half for each, but
any auditor worth his salt would very soon
drop on the fake. Moreover, “securities”
properly so called only became liable to duty
in 1920, and the duty in every case must be
denoted by an impressed stamp.
* * * *
“Cwrw Bach”: Just now when the sheep-
breeders are considering whether the export
of stud sheep should be prohibited, it may
be news to some that the merino is not the
only Australian production which is being
rushed by over-sea breeders. In an article
on Australorps (i.e., Australian black Orping-
tons) a British agricultural journal gives
some facts which may be a pleasant sur-
prise to the average Aussie whose main inter-
est in poultry is that eggs are 2s. od. a
dozen. The British Austral Orpington Club
was founded in 1921 with 110 members, and
“since then it has gone on in leaps and
bounds, and enormous numbers of birds have
been imported from Australia. It is
largely bred in Scotland, nearly every poultry
farm of any size stocking same..... .It was
the Australian Leghorn that caused the great
utility boom in America and this country.”
According to M. A. O’Callaghan, the dairy
expert, the Illawarra milking shorthorn is
quite distinct from the British breed, and
now that that good Australian Melba XV. has
again broken the world’s record for butter-
production, it should not be long before we
export stud dairy stock. The Yanks have
had a monopoly in these world’s records so
far, and it may come to pass that we will
be sending them something else besides ten-
nis champions.

Kelso King writes that it wasn’t he who
secured the late General Finn’s appointment
as secretary of the Walter and Eliza Hall
Trust; the appointment was made, he says,
on the nomination of the benefactress, the
late Mrs. Hall.
“Detective Dogwatch”: Victorian Judges
are not the only ones who refrain from don-
ning the black cap when dealing out death
sentences (B. 10/7/’24). The grim bit of
headgear has become obsolete in N. S. Wales,
too.
“D.F.”: Tasmania is the only Australian
State which has no camels. Victoria used
to be in the same position, Zoo and Oscar
Asche specimens not counted; but there, is
now a team at work on the job of hauling
salt at the Pink Lakes, up in the Mallee,
near Underbool.
“Trevdee”: Just another queer accident
before the door closes. Some years ago a
steam-roller was rumbling along a street in
Brunswick (Vic.). The usual man with
the red flag was walking'ahead. A nervous
young horse in a gig began to play up. Its
antics caused the man on foot to stop and
watch ; the man on the roller watched also,
but lie didn’t stop. The man with the flag
w r as buried next day.
“Pejabe”: A Chink who chooses Look
On for a name has an advertising sense.
As his fruit and vegetable van passed through
Hawthorn (Vic.) the other day I npted that
even those in the biggest hurry to catch
trains spared a moment for a glance and a
smile. It must have been a joy to the sign-
w'riter to tickle that four-wheeler with such
a name.
“Q.Q.Q.”: The heathen Chinee hasn’t a
monopoly of ways that are dark. An outsize
Maori went into a fashionable, local tailor,
ordered a 14-guinea suit, and paid £1 deposit.
After he’d had the usual try-ons, Hon de-
cided to wait a while before collecting the
raiment. He kept an eagle eye on the shop
until eventually the suit appeared in the
window marked “Unclaimed, a bargain, at
£6.” Then Hori closed.
“H.M.” : My Rabbinical friend, who wears
the whiskers prescribed by Jewish law, in-
duced me to attend the Sydney sheep-show
with him. It may have been the quaintness
of his facial upholstery, but most of the dogs
certainly barked as he passed. “That vos
vunny!” he commented. “It says in der
Talmud dat nod efen der dogs would bark
at an Israelite. But, b’raps,” he added,
“dey vos not know dot I am an Israelite!”
Having reached the retiring age W. H.
Rennick, assistant chief-engineer of ways
and works in Vic. railways, is getting out
at the end of July. As a private engineer
he did some of his biggest jobs before the
railways snapped him up 35 years ago. He
was the engineer-in-charge of the Queen s
(general traffic) Bridge over the Yarra, and
of railway spans over the same classic stream
on the St. Kilda and Port Melbourne lines.
“Fitz”: I met in front of the Chronicle
office in Wingham (N.S.W.) the other day
.John Lyon, Andrew Herkes and George
Soars, each of them 80 years, old. Lyon has
been blind practically all his life, but
has been gifted by Nature in.many other ways.
He recently made a penknife—blade, handle
and all —a regular work of art. Years ago
Jack Pollock asked him what he thought
of a buggy he had built. Lyon walked round
the vehicle, felt it carefully and spotted a
flaw in the woodwork. It had escaped the
notice of the builder, and was rectified.
“Borom” : “T.P.,” who complains of stamps
disappearing from his oversea letters (B.
3/7/’24), may be interested to know that a
regulation was gazetted some years ago for-
bidding postal officials to indulge in philately.
But I question if any serious attempt has
ever been made to enforce it. A youth
employed in a Vic. country post-office some
years ago showed me his collection, and re-
marked that he had got nearly all of it to-
gether during less than 12 months. If
such opportunities as that offer in a country
town they must be something extra-good in
the cities.
“Sturt”: S.A. Supreme Court has relied
on an aged precedent for doing substantial
justice. J. A. Breaden, of Central Austra-
lia, travelled from Oodnadatta to Adelaide by
train after his last illness came on him, tak-
ing his will in a bag, but on the drfeary three-
days’ journey it somehow disappeared, and no
trace of it can be found. A draft of it was avail-
able, and the Court, on the strength of sev-
eral affidavits that deceased had signed this
will, and was not known to have signed a
later one, allowed the draft to be taken as a
will and admitted to probate.
“Bill Losler”: The last of Cobb’s coaches
has just disappeared. Until quite recently
they were running regular services in these
parts with the identical vehicles used in the
olden days. With St. George (S.-W. Queens-
land) as centre, the coaches and “shanghais”
radiated to Bollen, Surat and Thallon, but
all three services have now been discon-
tinued, and the coaches replaced by cars and
lorries. Cobb and Co. still exist, but only
as proprietors of a chain of stores through
S.-W. Queensland. Here at St. George, in
back-yard stables, slumber the last of the
coaches that were once the pride of the
Western roads. I would suggest that one
of them be procured and given an honorable
place in the National Museum at Canberra.
“Harold Hardupp”: “It really amounts to
a renting proposition,” remarked a member
of the N.S.W. Board of Trade after an
agent had testified that three-quarters of
the householders of Sydney were buying their
own homes ; and after the process had been
explained Judge Beeby worked it out that
it would take some of them 190 years to
acquire freehold at the rate specified. The
rent-purchase system provides a coating for
the pill of landlordism. With the idea that
the house he occupies is bound to be his
own some day, the occupant becomes a docile
tenant, effecting improvements and paying
rates and taxes, as well as forking out (in
addition to his weekly rent) a substantial
deposit in the first place. Meanwhile the
landlord gets his rent as if he were merely
an ordinary landlord, and retains an excel-
lent chance of re-acquiring the entire pro-
perty when the tenant-purchaser has lost
heart and given up the struggle. After less
than seven years a large house-building com-
pany has under 60 per cent, of the tenant-
purchasers in the houses they hoped to make
their own

Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery
Of all the new discoveries in medical science the most remarkable of recent
years is one which has proved invaluable to thousands of people and which is
rapidly taking: the place of all other remedies for the relief of cougrhs and colds.
This preparation is called Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery for Coughs and Colds,
and is a scientific compound of great merit. It is most healing to the lungs and
throat and stops the cough or cold in a remarkably short time, leaving no bad
after-effects.
A few doses of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery, taken when a cold is coming on are
generally all that is needed to soothe the fever and correct the bodily discomfort
of a severe cold. It is well to continue taking New Discovery for a day or two,
even after the attack seems averted, for its soothing influence on the mucous
membrane renders one less liable to a second attack.
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is a favorite Cough Remedy for men, women and
children. It will protect you this winter from any tendency to Bronchitis, from
having a bad Cold in the head and from Influenza. There is nothing better
than New Discovery to prevent or relieve the children in an attack of Croup
and Whooping Cough.
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is Australia’s National Remedy and is good for
all the family.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TJHE grave that was a ragged wound
With verdure now is covered o’er;
Where dews of sorrow wet the ground
The little dancing flowers have found
Their home and grief is known no more.
Here sleeps the laughing, Elinor.
Here is the grave of Elinor
Whose joyful life so swiftly sped,
Where mourners stood, but come no more.
Healed also is the wound they bore;
Now only, with his white, bowed head,
One mourner sits beside her bed.
New playmates have the children found ;
New joyful cares have now up-grown
Within their elders’ busy round.
But he who sits beside the mound
Counts not that happy spirit flown
That Death has made of all his own.
For others Life’s onmoving tide
With laughing voices calls once more;
But she is nearest to his side
Who in their careless thought has died.
He watches for the opening door
Beside the grave of Elinor.

“Oakes’s Oath.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A GOOD long time ago—rather more
than a century—Mr. Francis Oakes,
Chief Constable of Parramatta, giv-
ing evidence in court, was asked whether he
was prepared to swear to the truth of a
statement he had made. For a few moments
he is . said to have considered the question
thoughtfully. At length he came to a deci-
sion and gained everlasting fame by reply-
ing; “Well, I’ll chance it.” It is significant,
perhaps, that Mr. Oakes had been a mission-
ary in the South Seas—nearly every minis-
ter of any religion that has ever existed has
had to chance the truth of statements he
has been called upon to make. There could
hardly be any sort of creed whose devotees
were not prepared to do as Mr. Oakes did
about his oath. But the saying became a
proverb, and there are plenty of old people
still living on the Hawkesbury and the
Hunter, and down by Goulburn Plains, who
would quite readily understand you when
you said you would do “as Oakes did.”
All this by way of explanation of the story’s
title. But Francis Oakes was a highly respect-
able man, and his evidence was no doubt as
correct as he could make it. The subject of
this memoir, on the other hand, was not
respectable at all, and his “chancing” was
lamentably disastrous.
* * * #
In 1837 her late Majesty Queen Victoria
reached the throne, and Mr. Emanuel Gala-
thiel came to Sydney from Van Diemen’s
Land. To many citizens of the mother
colony, in the years that succeeded, it was
far easier to forget the former fact than
the latter. More than two generations since,
the influence of Mr. Galathiel may still be
traced in certain lives that are being lived
now. Eighty years is all too short a time
in which to nullify the actions of such a
man as he was. It will be almost another
80 before the mark he made in Sydney is
obliterated.
He was a free man when he landed in the
Cove—“free by servitude,” as they used to
say—but he had been almost as good as such
from the day he landed in Hobart Town
15 years before, under a sentence of 14.
Having saved another man the trouble of
writing his name, he had been convicted of
forgery at the Middlesex Sessions of April.
1822, and had arrived at the other end of
the earth a little before Christmas in the
same year. Only a single circumstance had
saved him from providing one bf those spec-
tacles outside Newgate, so popular in Lon-
don a hundred years ago, that had termi-
nated the careers of many business men of
different sorts opposite to the tower of St.
Sepulchre’s Church. The Judge who tried
Mm had termed it “a Judas-like betrayal of
less guilty accomplices,” and although such
an expression reads a little harshly, there
can be no doubt that Mr. Galathiel continued
to be an existing fact, and not an unplea-
sant memory, only because he had very com-
pletely given away to the officers of the law
all of those who had been concerned with
him in as impudent a piece of roguery as
had ever excited the interest of the just and
unjust alike in the large city on the estuary
of the Thames. It is not that story that is
to be told now, though it is a very curious
and interesting story indeed, and caused Mr.
Galathiel to be remembered in London for
very many years after he had departed out
of its boundaries.
Arrived in the Derwent, it was not long
before his character and talents had obtained
for him such alleviation of a hard lot as
was to be found in the possession of a
ticket-of-leave. They were such talents, and
his was such a character, as had been pos-
sessed by Mr. Jonathan Wild, of immortal
memory. Nothing was too villainous for
him to undertake, nothing too sacred to be-
tray. no means too bad to justify the end.
In that community of rogues and unscrupu-
lous officials which was Hobart Town in
the twenties of the last century he found,
such uses for the talents, and such an in-
difference as to the character of their pos-
sessor on the part of those whose interests
led them to employ the former, as to ensure
him many immunities not enjoyed by his
less gifted contemporaries in the prison
population of the island. So he prospered
exceedingly as a receiver of stolen goods on
the one hand, and as an ally of the police
upon the other. But when 1837 brought
him complete liberty to go where he would,
he came to the conclusion that any other
part of the young Queen’s dominions would
be a healthier dwelling-place for him than
the queer little town nestling at the foot of
Mount Wellington. So he proceeded to Syd-
ney, and established himself in George-street
a little below the Barracks, as what is most
favorably characterised as a financier. lie
lent the people who wanted it money, and
took great pains to ensure that it came back
to him substantially increased. Also he
cultivated a side-line in blackmail that was
exceedingly profitable, and in other similar
ventures; so that by 1845 he was a verv
rich man indeed, with a large stake in the
country, and a reputation which, if it was
not invariably pleasing to persons particular
about such things,--gave no sort of coiiceru
to Mr. Emanuel Gdlatllieh
So we come to the year 1850, and the
day when Mr. Thbm&s > Martin Handyside,
clerk in the General Post Office, took a walk
down George-street' to call upon Mr. Gala-
tliiel at his office.
Mr. Handyside Was a young man of not-
able, if not distinguished, appearance. It
v/as not possible to overlook him in the par-
ticular piece of scenery he might happen to
adorn, lie had a pink face ornamented with
straw-colored side-whiskers, an eyeglass, a
velvet jacket, a flowered waistcoat with two
gold watchcliains, pegtop pantaloons o,f a
large check pattern, shiny little boots, a
silver-topped carte with his monogram oil it,
many rings upon his fingers, a top-hat, and
the air and bearing of one whom we would
in these days find Wearing purple silk speks
and the reputatioji (if a knut. As he passed
upon his way, ogling pretty wearers of crino-
lines through his eyeglass, lie had a
factory impression that he was a distinct
ornament to Sydney's main artery. You or
I, perhaps, contemplating him across seven
decades, would classify him as a very typical
specimen of the mid-Victorian bounder.
Three golden balls decorated the front of
Mr. Galathiel’s business premises near
.Bridge-street, but Mr. Galathiel’s private
office was approached by a narrow door in
a lane, and a (light of Stairs that led to the
first floor. Between the, hours of 9 a.m.
and (j p.m. the door stood hospitably open,
and a painted sign' on the wall within in-
vited visitors to “Walk up and knock.” This
Mr. Handyside did, Was; bidden to enter, and
found himself standing before the desk of a
vulture-like gentleman lof Hebraic cast of
countenance. '
“Good morning, ’Manuel,” lie drawled.
“You —-haw -wished to see me, did you?
Ai’ve just had your note. Doosid incon-
venient to gpt out just now. you know -but
here I am. demme. Here I am.”
He sprawled elegantly over a chair Whilst
Mr. Galathiel went on writing for a good
minute or more without paying him any
attention. Presently he laid down his pen,
sanded the document he had been inditing,
and leaned back in his chair, whilst he re-
garded his visitor With a sour smile and an
expression that was npt pleasant.
“Tommy,” he said ’slowly, “the game’tli
up. I don’t think it’ll be long before you’re
a-livin’ in Darlinghurtht.”
Mr. Handyside pulled himself together and
sat up, the eyeglass dropping amongst the
gold chains on the gorgeous waistcoat to
the full extent of the watered silk ribbon
that secured it to his person. The pink
face went a little pale.
“What d’ye mean, ’Manuel? Demme,
what’s the matter?-’
“Oh, nothing Vary much, me dear boy.
Only I underthtaud that Major Christie ith
likely to become aware of the fact that
you’ve been tampering with correthpondertth
passing through life Potht Offithe. In fact,
that you have improperly obtained informa-
tion contained in lettertli entrusted to hith
care as Postmasteif-General, and have, on at
least two occasions, actually purloined tliuch
letters for your own purposes. I thought that
perhapth you’d like fo know this.”
His thin, clean-shaVen face seemed to Mr.
Handyside to haiffi become almost devilish
in its malignancy.
“Good God!” he gasped. “How has it
been found out?”
“Well, I thought it my duty to inform
the Major of what I know. You thee, dear
boy, this game cafi’t go on for ever. ’Twath
bound to finish some time —and it struck me
that it would be. better if it were found out
now than later on. So I have, ath they
uthed to thay in London when I wath a lad.
‘blown the gaff.’ You thee. Tommy, my boy.
I had to think bf 'mythelf. It would have
been very unpleasant—quite out of the ques-
tion indeed—for me to have been arrested.
Tho I have arranged that you will be taken
up when you go downstairs again. I’m
thorry for you, my young friend; but, if
you will do these tliingth, you must be pre-
pared for trouble.” ,
Mr. Handysife whimpered, as he wiped
his face with a red Silk handkerchief.
“O my God. ’Manuel, why have you done
this? I did it for you. You know I did.
You’ve paid me to do it. You’ve got the
letters I took. Good God, you’re in it as
much as I am Jr
Mr. Galathicl grinned, and shook his head.
“No, no —Tommy, my dear boy. No, no—
not at all. Not in it at all—except for the
prothecution. Everything’s ,in order. This
will be your funeral, dear boy, not mine.
Tith better tho. < People would mith me
much more than you’ll be mithed. You
thee, I’ll be able to swear that you made
thith confethion of your ill behavior. For-
tunately. your hafid’th an easy one to imi-
tate. I’ll be quite tliafe. Not in it at-all.”
Mr. Handyside stared at Mr. Galathiel in-
credulously. He was quite white now, and
the cane fell on the floor with a rattle as it
dropped from his shaking fingers. He burst
into tears.
“O my God, ’Manuel—d’ye mean to say
you’re villain ehou;gh to forge a confession I
never wrote?”
Galathiel nodded pleasantly, still smiling.
“But—but ybu can’t swear to it. You
can’t go into the witness-box and swear I’Ve
written that—that confession. Good
heavens, you can^t!”
Mr. Galathiel laughed cheerfully. “Oh,
well, you know, dehr boy—Oakes’s oath, you
know. I’ll chalice it.”

The case against Thomas Martin Handy-
side seemed tb be very complete when
the Crown Prosecutor outlined it to the
jury. Betters h|d been opened arid re-
sealed whilst passing through the post office.
Valuable information had been obtained by
such means that: had been used to the detri-
ment of those whost interests demanded that
it should be kept sqcret. In some cases let-
ters and packages had entirely disappeared.
And so on. The ifisoiler had given himself
away—fortunately to a gentleman in whom
public-spirit and a? sense of duty had tri-
umphed over instindts of compassion towards
a young and foolish man who had been living
beyond his means. He had made a written
confession, about which there could be no

THE PENALTY OF OVERWORK
Many People are Beginning to Feel the Strain
The heavy tax of overwork, the extra strain so
necessary to many trades and occupations, is hard
on the kidneys. The kidneys fail in their work
and the poisonous matter collects in the system.
If your work seems hard for you, if you have a
lame, weak or aching back, if you seem tired and
listless, if you notice sediment in the urine,
unnatural color, or irregular passages, and seem
to be running down without apparent cause, begin
at once with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, the
remedy that has proved so beneficial to your
neighbors. It has brought strength to the backs
of thousands of working men and women. Sydney
proof is given here.

A MAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mr. W. H. Tjott, “Fairview,” Gannon Street, Tempe,
Sydney, says: “Off and on for years I suffered a good deal
from backache and kidney trouble. Sometimes my back used
to ache terribly, the pain being particularly severe when I
stooped. One day Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were recom-
mended to me, so I bought some and tjiey worked wonders.
After taking a few doses I felt much better, so I continued
with the treatment for a few weeks, and I am glad to say
they drove the pain out of my back and made me feel
splendid. Two years have elapsed since then, and I am still
free of backache, but I keep Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills by
me, and take a dose or so whenever I feel a little off color,
and they always do me good.”
Twelve years later, Mr. Trott says: “Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills cured me of backache 14 years ago, and I am
still free from this trying complaint.”

PEOPLE

BACKACHE
AND KIDNEY
TROUBLE.
A WOMAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mrs. Emily Osborne, 5 Queen Street, Petersham, Sydney,
says: “Some years ago I had a very bad attack of disordered
kidneys, and, as a result suffered agony from backache and
rheumatic pains all over my body. I was often so bad that
I could hardly get about the house, every movement giving me
increased pain. My rest at night was very disturbed, as it was
impossible for me to lie .in one position for any length of time,
owing to the nagging pain in my back. My ankles and arms
swelled a good deal, and were very painful if I touched them.
I had no energy for anything, and was really far from well.
Doan’s Backache-Kidney Pills were recommended to me, and
after taking a course of these grand Pills I was completely
cured.”
Ten years later, Mrs. Osborne says: “Ten years have
elapsed since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me, and i
am still well, a fact that speaks volumes for this splendid
remedy.”

the matter. The case was a very simple one.
Mr. Emanuel Galathiel told his story very
well, and very convincingly: but it was re-
marked in court that neither the foppish
young man in the dock nor his counsel
seemed very much disturbed by it. In fact,
when the latter rose to cross-examine, the
prisoner was smiling, as if in anticipation of
the best results.
“This so-called confession, Mr. Galathiel —
you observe the date on it?”
Mr. Galathiel remembered it quite well.
It was September 25, 1850.
“You have sworn that the prisoner wrote
it in your presence, and your clerk has sworn
to his own signature as a witness —isn’t that
so?”
“Yeth.”
“Can you tell me which hand the prisoner
w-rites with?”
“His right hand.”
“He wrote this document with that hand?”
“Yeth.”
“You are quite prepared to swear that?”
“Thertainly.”
Counsel paused, and regarded Mr. Gala-
thiel intently for a moment or two. Then
lie asked him a curious question.
1 “Have you ever heard the expression, Mr.
Galathiel, that refers to Oakes’s oath?”
“Oh, yeth—of course.”
“You know what it means?”
“Yeth.”
“Ah. And—remembering that you are upon
oath—you w-ill still swear that, on September
the 25th, the prisoner wrote and signed this
er—confession with his right hand?”
“Thertainly I will.”
“H’m. Well, I won’t trouble you further,
Mr. Galathiel. You may stand down. Call
Dr. Hamilton.”
Having found out that Dr. Hamilton was
a duly-qualified medical practitioner, residing
in Lyons’s Terrace, Hyde Park, counsel pro-
ceeded to question him as to his knowledge of
the prisoner.
“Has the accused ever been a patient of
yours, Doctor?”
“Yes.”
“When was he last a patient?”
The doctor consulted a notebook.
“From September 24 to October 10 this
jear.”
“For what did you attend him?”
“For a whitlow on his right hand. On the
second finger.”
“Was it a very bad one?”
“Very bad indeed.”
“Could he have used a pen on September
25?”
“No, it would have been quite impossible
for him to have done so. His hand was
very painful, and was completely bandaged
up. In fact, he was carrying it in a sling.”
“You are certain that he could not have
used a pen on that day?”
“Quite certain. Not on that day, nor for
a week afterwards. It would have been
altogether impossible.”
“Ah, thank you, Doctor. That is all I
have to ask you.”
There is not room here for the whole of
‘-lie eloquent address to the jury delivered by
Mr. Handyside’s counsel. But these were its
concluding sentences:
“And so, gentlemen, I leave it to you to
confound this diabolic liar, who will, no
doubt, suffer a prosecution for his gross and
malevolent perjury. You heard me ask
him whether he was familiar with the ex-
pression ‘as Oakes did his oath.’ You heard
liis reply. He had the effrontery to chance
it.’ But his ‘chancing it’ will lead him to
his ruin. In view- of his evidence I don t
think my client has much to fear at your
hands. Perhaps Mr. Emanuel Galathiel will
have time to reflect in his future seclusion
what a truly risky thing it is to do as
Oakes did in a court of law. Gentlemen,
with every confidence I call upon you for an
acquittal.”

Brown’s Dog.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BILL BROWN travelled with a dog.
A spotted dog. It was never
satisfactorily settled on the field
whether Brown owned the dog or “the dawg ’
owned Brown. I think the dawg won on
points. Certainly, to see him trotting patron-
isingly ahead of Brown up the little town-
ship road leading the w r ay to work, and later
the way back to dinner, was to get the im-
pression that the dawg owned the whole
township.
The dawg had a woolly head loaded with
a perverted intellect, big brown eyes, clean
teeth, about 18 inches of bright red tongue
and fleas. It grew its chest well out and
its tail well up. That tail told a tale of
the plump body never having tasted the toe
of a boot. It was an altogether uncivilised dog.
Brown w-ould follow obediently behind,
his worshipping eyes never off the dawg. He
was a nuggetty, black-moustached, rather
dull man, but well liked among the opal
gougers all the same.
One peculiarity of the dawg w-as its par-
tiality for the pub. The joyhouse dispensed
anything from plain beer to unbeatable hor-
rors ; it simply depended on the thirst of the
drinker and the size of his cheque. These
refreshments were served at the Old Town,
three miles down the road. When the mon-
grel was missing an anxious Brown would
make straight for the boarding-house. There
“Have you seen me dawg?” he would ask
hopefully of the cook.
The cook had no time for Browrn, and
w-ould merely say he hadn’t. Then Brown
would trudge the three miles to the pub, and
later on the dawg would come trotting back
leading Brown.
Apart from bones there was no visible
reason why the pub should have a fascina-
tion for the dawg. In his previous life he
may have been a beer-chewer. Or a publi-
can. Especially did he like the pub when a
big opal-buyer had visited the field. For
days the big bar would be crowded with
thirsty men assimilating their cheques. At
such times the dawg’s eyes would literally
shine their approval. He could never keep
still, trotting up and down the long bar-
floor among the tramping feet of the roy-
sterers, joining in the chorus of boisterous
songs with lively barking. He refereed
fights, and later accompanied the star artists
to the pump and helped them sluice off the
surplus hair and skin. He would sit on his
haunches and stare open-mouthed at this
operation, his big brown eyes saying plain
as daylight, “Bully, boys!” Finally, no
fight was complete without Brown’s dawg.
I have known promising fights delayed for
hours simply to allow Brown’s dawg to turn
up.
When a man had engulfed that quantity
of beer which made it necessary for him to
sleep it off wherever he hit the ground, the
dawg always seemed to get disgusted. He
would walk superciliously up to the snoring
imbiber, sniff his breath reflectively, then ex-
press disdain. It was a standing joke on
the field that no man had ever been properly
sizzled who had not been counted out by-
Brown’s dawg.
Strange to say, Brown drank very little
himself. This failing of Brown’s the dawg
took very much to heart. He would look
shamefaced when Brown turned the pub
corner. Leading the way into the bar with
drooped tail (the only time his _ tail did
droop), he would point his nose invitingly at
the bar, and then gaze at Brown with re-
proachful eyes. Brown had to drink three
beers and sham very drunk before the dawg
would take him proudly home.
One day the crowd, being half-lit up and
consequently very happy and full of strength
and brains, conceived the brilliant idea of
making Brown’s dawg drunk. They invited
him to down a long beer, which lie straight-
way did in most approved fashion, asking
plainly for another, which was immediately
forthcoming. He asked for a repetition,
which w-as delightedly put before him. The
dawg then hiccuped, and walked lop-sidedly
towards the bar. The laughing crowd lifted
him on the bar-counter and played it low-
down on him. They gave him another
beer dosed with whisky. One low-principled
coot wished to drop his cheap cigar-ash into
the pot, but the crowd counted him out.
They wanted, they said emphatically, to give
the dawg a fair spin.
The dawg shortly after tried a jazz on his
hind legs up and down the bar-counter to
a roaring song from the delighted crowd, who
kept him from falling off by the simple ex-
pedient of pushing him back. The dawg
then stood on his nose and tried to wag
hip tail while barking, but gravitation drew
him irresistibly downward, where he fell
into an open hogshead of sour beer at the back
of the counter. Here he w-ould have been
drowned if the publican had not pulled him
out by his feebly-wagging tail.
When Brown’s dawg came to he tried
to go home. A quarter of a mile up the
road, feeling very sick, he reached Mrs.
Smith’s house. Mrs. Smith came down off
her doorstep, and nodded her head com-
prehendingly. She gathered him up in cap-
able big arms and laid him in the shade on
a bag beside the fowlhouse. Then she went
to the well and very soon had poured four
buckets of icy-cold water over his head and
back. He whined gratefully with , closed
eyes: but his head was ’ all lead and he
couldn’t lift it.
At this time Brown came striding along
the road. Mrs. Smith called: “Are you look-
ing for your dog, Mr. Brow-n? Here he is.”
Brown came over and gazed down at the
dawg in astonishment. Then fear spread
quickly over his quiet face. “For Gawd's
sake don’t say he’s sick,” he pleaded in a
low voice. “He won’t die. will he?”
“Of course he won’t.” said the woman
practically: “he’s only drunk.”
“What?” Brown gazed up at the woman
in a way that accused her of being drunk.
“They made him drunk at the pub,” she
said sharply.
Brown stood up and gazed amazedly down
the road towards, the pub. Then a look of
cold fury stole over liis face. He spat twice
emphatically on his hands, rubbed them, and,
rolling up the sleeves of his flannel, set off
towards the pub in a walk that was almost
a run.
“Don’t be a fool,” Mrs. Smith called after
him. “There’s 40 men down there. They’re
all drunk. They’ll mob you.”
Brown kept on, and after a moment Mrs.
Smith ran after him. She caught him up
and grasped his arm determinedly, gradually
slowing him up.“ Look here,” she said as
they walked along, “those men only did it
for a joke. It was a dirty joke, I know,
but drunken men don’t know any better.
They didn’t mean any harm, really. If you
go down there they’ll want you to join in
the laugh with them. When you start fight
they’ll all turn on you. You won’t have a
chance. See them to-morrow or the day
after —or whenever they’re sober.”
Gradually she, stopped Brown, and soon
after, still talking, piloted him into the kit-
chen. Brown, though brooding and sulky,
was soon getting outside some bread and
butter and well-made tea with milk in it.
Brown’s dawg, joined the prohibition ranks.
He never after went to the pub, and would
walk a long way around to avoid even an
empty bottle. Mrs'. Smith’s always pulled
him up.
Brown liked the dawg going to Mrs.
Smith’s, because then he could go there look-
ing for him.
Mrs. Smith was a widow woman whose
fortune w-as a plain face, five children and
a big heart.
Brown in his slow way began to do a lot
of thinking. He lived in a hut with fleas
in it. Mrs. Smith lived in a nice clean house
with a garden. He baked his own poor
dampers. Mrs. Smith baked bonzer yeast
bread. Mrs. Smith’s juicy roast beef was
always done to a turn. A man could go
three plates easy, especially with baked
spuds. Hi 3 own salt junk was always
stringy and tough. Besides, the dawg had
made a home there.
One day Brown proposed.
“You know, I’ve got a good opal-claim,
Mrs. Smith?” Brown one day said feelingly.
“Yes!”- said Mrs. Smith encouragingly.
“An’ you’ve got a good home,” went on
Brown quickly, “an I’ve got a cow of a one.
An’ you’re a, good sort of a woman, an’ I’m
not a bad sort of a bloke. Besides, the dawg’s
made his home here.” Brown paused bash-
fully. “Wot if you take me in too ?” he added.
“Meaning?” asked Mrs. Smith softly.
“We get married.” whispered Brown.
Mrs. Smith gazed at the man reflectively.
“I don’t mind admitting I was thinking that
way myself,” she said quietly.
Brown reached out suddenly and caught
Mrs. Smith’s strong hand, with a burst of
confidence.
“ ’Struth!” he laughed delightedly, “I felt
like I w-as asking for the whole Rnming
Empire with Buckley’s chance of getting it.
Say”
“Matilda,” prompted Mrs. Smith softly.
