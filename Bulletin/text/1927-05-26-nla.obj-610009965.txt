“Oh, any tobacco, I suppose.”
* My child, they don’t have to get the

It’s only the coarse, cheap leaves from the

THE MOUTH THE GATEWAY for DISEASE.
Scientists have proved conclusively that no fewer
than 38 different infections may be traced to the
human mouth as a starting point. The mouth thus
being the gateway for the entrance of disease, it
is here that precautions are most necessary.
Hudson’s Eumenthol
Jujubes
Are the most powerful, safe and pleasant Germi-
cide and Antiseptic known. Beinr destructive to
all organisms which give rise to infectious diseases,
they keep the mouth in a sweet, healthy condition.
The Lancet (London) states: —“Their purpose is to
act as a bactericide in the mouth. This result is
I'.kely to be gained, for in the experiments tried
.Eumenthol Jujubes proved to be as effective bae-
tericidally as is creosote.’’

Art and the Movies
I am by no means content to believe that
moving pictures are particularly bad for
people. They may be dull; they often are
dull; but they are not as dull as the daily
newspaper, the daily gossip, or the daily
grind. They may be indecent, but they
are not as indecent as the divorce -courts,
the “yarner” or the corset advertisements.
They may be morbid and unsavory, but
they are neither as morbid nor as unsavory
as the “news” dished up to us every day
by press magnates, who get knighted, let
us hope, for services in other fields. Against
their dulness, their indecency and their
morbidity, they are frequently amusing
and occasionally genuinely interesting. They
may even be sometimes instructive, though
that is a minor sin which I hope will not
become a major vice. I enjoy them a
good deal myself; I don’t think they are:
as pleasant as a number of other things,
like cafes where one can get a drink, and
theatres that are neither “snappy” nor
“culchawed”; but in a country where these
things are rare, the picture-show is, on the
whole, highly entertaining.
But there is one little matter that is
tending to become a big matter, upon
which I decidedly disagree with “the pit-
chers.” Their makers are developing a
habit of using the word “art” with a capital
A. One is more or less accustomed to it
in the managers of Repertory theatres, but
it is deplorable that it should pollute the
otherwise honest hearts of the gentlemen
who live in Hollywood.
There is only one way of being sincere
towards art, and that is to think of it as
art, and not as Art. Vaudeville is very
frequently refreshing, because genuine skill
and ability often occur without any sug-
gestion that they are Art. There was,
fairly obviously, something of the same
innocence in William Shakspeare. Peopl.
like Lilly, he probably thought, were
Artists; but he, Will of the Globe, wa
perfectly content to be merely a play
wright. Which is perhaps the reason wh>
some of us like him still. '
However, this is rather by the way. The
point I am on is the Artiness or Artfulness
of the picture producers. I have not the
slightest doubt, that there is an art o
picture-making and an art of picture-acting
but they are not high arts, and hardl.s
arts at all in the sense in which we can
speak of the art of literature or the ar;
of etching or the art of acting in the
theatre proper. It did not need Luig
Pirandello to make it, but he has admirably
stressed the point that, the intervention o:
the machine in the film-making process is
a fatal rupture, The contact between high
art and the individual who comes to it
must be immediate. The author must
really be the author of something in the
other’s mind, and this implies that his con-
tact must be free and intimate and human
He must be able to pass into the other
and the other must be able to feel him
within. There is involved, as a necessity
the opportunity for complete revelation aiic
full expression. It is here that the pictures
fail. They can give us a story, but they
can give only the incidents of the story
They cannot “hold up” while the author
tells us what is behind the incidents, while
he reveals the psychological developments
and the emotional movement. Macbeth is
always being hurried on to the murder
and his end; not for an instant can he
pause to think on the life that is but a
walking shadow and an idiot’s tale. The
film, in short, lacks the ability to portray
spiritual values. Good as an actor may
be, he cannot convey by gesture or expres-
sion on the screen what a painter can con-
vey with a stroke of his brush oh the
canvas, or a writer with a sentence on his
pad.
Most of us, I suppose, have experienced
that queer sort of disappointment that
comes when we see a favorite book or
play on the screen. I do not mean the
disappointment that is merely an aspect of
the anger we have when a story is pal-
pably spoilt, but that which follows when
we see, as we have done Sometimes lately,
a picture that has striven its hardest to
convey the essential impression of the
theme. I think we are most of us content
to damn the producer, but the real reason
for the failure, of course, is the inadequacy
, medium. How, for example, could
the 'Pickwick Papers” be done on the
£lms? How “The Brothers Karamazov,”
Don Quixote,” “Hamlet,” “The Importance
of Being Earnest”? How could anything,
m brief that has moral and intellectual
subtlety?
It simply cannot; and it appears to me
highly desirable that the people behind the
business should recognise the fact, just as
vaudeville has recognised it, and be con-
tent with a destiny, which if less noble is
in many ways as attractive, and always
worthy. Let them be content to amuse
and interest and delight us; let us have
jollity and excitement and passion; but
for Heaven’s sake don’t serve us up sloppy
pars, in the manner of the snobs who ar*
“litary” and “so artistic,” and who already
infest, us overmuch.
D.P. McGUIRE.
Every Other Inch a King
' ' lere are few generous estimates of the
character of Charles 11., but to these few
John Drinkvvater has made a notable addi-
tion. Mr. Charles, King o/ England (Hod-
der and Stoifghton; Angus and Robertson),
is indeed the most generous tribute that has
ever been paid to the memory of any man
who stands so thoroughly discredited at the
bar of history. To read this book may not.
be to know all, but it is at least to under-
stand a great deal more than we have
allowed ourselves to,understand before; and
though we may not' be prepared to forgive
all, it will make us a little ashamed of the
historical convention which has decided that
Charles 11. was a thoroughly disreputable
person. We have agreed to this convention
without taking the trouble to realise the cir-
cumstances of the world in which this king
underwent strange vicissitudes of fortune;
and we have made little allowance for the
fact that, intellectually and spiritually, the
environment which conditioned his life has
since undergone an almost incalculable
change.
It was a great handicap to start in life the
son of Charles 1., in whom the insecurity
of the Stuart character was rendered fatal
by incurable stupidity; but anything that
was wanting to make such a handicap almost
insupportable was supplied by Henrietta
Maria, the mother ot this child. The very
best that can be said for Charles I. and his
Consort is that, as parents, they were excep-
tionally virtuous; but that, unfortunately,
was an altogether insufficient basis for suc-
cessful sovereignty. The only theory of
kingship that young Charles learned from
liis mother was that kings were answerable
to God alone, and that the whole duty of
subjects was implicit and docile obedience.
..In his years of exile, as he wandered
through Europe with his pathetic little band
of followers, uncertain where arid how he
might obtain credit for the morrotv, was it
any wonder that he accustomed himself to
a condition of mind in which he was ready
to compromise on anything with anybody if
only he could regain his kingdom? Stern
moralists have allowed nothing to Charles
because he was deficient in the virtue of
personal chastity. They make no allowance
for the fact, that he came through a long
and terrible probation with surprising credit.
He had seen his own father, whom he had
been trained to look upon as a direct in-
strument of the Divine Purpose, defeated,
disgraced—and murdered. He had been
driven from his own inheritance with a price
upon his head. He had been used as the
merest plaything of half the rascals in Euro-
pean diplomacy. He had suffered indignities
which must have sorely tried his Stuart
pride. He had been sermonised by bigots
whom he surely recognised as the intolerant
fanatics that they were. That he emerged
with head unbowed is a matter for no small
wonder; that he should have come back
into his kingdom completely unembittered,
as he did, would have been an impossible
achievement for a man who had nothing
either of grace or nobility in his soul.
If Charles’s virtues had been equal to his
undoubted abilities he might have' made the
Restoration one of the supreme heroic events
in history; but it was not altogether his
own fault that his character had no desire
of expressing itself in that particular way.
He returned to a kingdom that had been
sorely tried by an exhibition of violent moral
splendor; he returned to a people who had
established a- claim to rights, not by the
favor- of the monarch, but by the privilege
of God; it was, in fact, his peculiar destiny
as a Stuart to be called upon to play his
part as the founder of Constitutional Mon-
archy. In the irony of such a situation
he compromised by not considering too
deeply the problems of his office, for his
sense of humor would not let him forget
that, though he were the descendant of
kings by right Divine, yet he enjoyed his
authority by reason of a very lucky turn in
the wheel of Fortune.
Charles’s treatment of' Clarendon is the
blackest stain on his character. It is impos-
sible to explain this in any other way than
to say it showed a defect in a side of this
character that is otherwise free from cen-
sure. There is no other recorded instance
of his having abandoned a servant to whom
he owed fidelity, and, so far as is known
every promise he made during his exile was
iaithfuljy redeemed as soon as the oppor-
tunity came. His mistresses might have had
rivals, but they were never deserted. He
may have dishonored his Consort by his
flagrant infidelities, but it should be remem-
bered to his credit that when Catherine’s
childless condition raised the question of
divorce, the King set his veto on the project.
And no appeal was ever made for his patron-
age on behalf of industry or learning that
failed to meet with an intelligent response.
Charles may stand convicted by the number
of his mistresses; but, though‘the Restora-
tion Court was a loose one, it was also one
that encouraged wit and learning, and in thi*
the King gave a decisive lead. Charles was
a patron of the drama; he could appreciate
poetry. Lely was his Court painter, and
Pepys tells us that he had some knowledge
of music, and liked it. He made Purcell

The Super-Six principle, released to full capacity in
Hudson, is also amazingly revealed in the Essex Super-
Srx. In performance as well as appearance, the Essex
Super-Six is an entirely new car
it reveals the capacity of the Super-Six principle. It
attains an engineering triumph in low maintenance
and operating cost.
It possesses such stamina that 50 miles an hour all day
long is an easy accomplishment. And so nimble and
alert is its action that no car will surpass the quickness
with which it may be driven through traffic or in tour-
ing* whether the trip is one of a few city blocks or
hundreds of miles. To both driver and passengers, there
is rare comfort in any kind of going.
Unusual accessibility means big savings in replacement,
service and all shop work. Economy in fuel and oil is
also a notable feature of the new Essex Super-Six*
It holds further exclusive advantages in its Super-Six
motor, four years of development has resulted in a
chassis that would permit full use of its capacity. In the
kssex Super-Six, performance, safety and reliability are
realized to a degree never approached in a car of its
size or price
There are five new bodies on the Essex Super-Six
chassis-—all beautiful, all smart in line, finish, appoint-
ment and upholstery. They are easily the paramount
values of Essex history.

GERALD DILLON.
The Greater Apollo
It may be rather a cliche to state that
this is a thoroughly commercial and efficient
age in which poetry has very little place;
nevertheless, like most cliches, it is per-
fectly true. The painter, of course, can
make himself useful by decorating build-
ings and filling up otherwise empty art
galleries, and the novelist can while awa;/
an odd half-hour while one digests one’s
dinner, but the poor poet (unless he be
an American ‘‘hobo-poet” and therefore
easily understood) has no place in the
modem scheme of things. Once upon a
time (as fairy-stories begin, and this does
sound like a fairy-story) the poet could
demand enormous sums from his publisher.
The amount Byron alone made is stagger-
ing; now he would very probably have to
pay even to see his work in print. At
least, that is, in Australia. What encourage-
ment have our younger poets? It is all
very nice to write illuminating articles
about their small output and their low
standard (or their high standard, as the
writer happens to think), but there are
really only three papers that deign to print
good poetry: one is The Bulletin, the
others the Melbourne Spinner and Sydney’s
Art in Australia. As for the publishers
—well, unless your pocket is very large
and you can guarantee the sales, you will
be very lucky indeed to see your work
in book-form. I do not mean this as any
slight on publishers: they are business men,
not philanthropists. It is the public I
refer to.
Here in Australia we have fine poets
whose names mean nothing to the average
man; but they are courageous, and they
write for the fully sufficient reason that
they are poets and therefore have to write.
And amongst the first of our men I would
place Robert D. Fitz Gerald. For years I
have scanned the pages of The Bulletin
for something from his pen, and often my
search has been rewarded; for years I have
followed his work and noted the slow devel-
opment, the stronger grip on technique,
the easier-flowing thought, until now he
seems to have reached well-nigh perfection
in his most difficult art. Yet even he
has been forced to publish his work himself
in a paper-covered slip of a book bearing
the title, “The Greater Apollo.” Fitz Gerald
has not only published this volume him-
self, but with a splendid gesture of con-
tempt he has (to quote the colophon)
published it “for private distribution by
gift among the author’s friends only. No
copies are for sale.” Perhaps this is a
little unfair, barring as it does so many
poetry-lovers, but one cannot help applaud-
ing the gesture that repudiates commer-
cialism, disdaining to offer its magic to a
heedless world.
Fitz Gerald has subtitled this book “Seven
Metaphysical Songs,” but I do not think
that it applies. These are not metaphysical
poems in the true sense of the word, but
seem rather a declaration of faith, a sort
of challenge to metaphysicians. Here in
this verse is placed as simply as possible
the whole meaning of the book:—
The valley path is calm and cool
As I walk here between green walls—
And those are diamond waterfalls;
This is a bird; and that’s a pool;
I heard their loud insistent calls,
And gladly have returned to these.
What is revealed to me and known
Beyond material things alone?
It is enough that trees are trees,
That earth is earth and stone is stone.
Certainly that is a very material philosophy,
far from metaphysics, which immediately
connotes abstractness: a simple philosophy,
a love for the fleeting beauties of earth,
its colors, forms, giant trees, sweet flowers
and lovely women. Nothing of the modem
cynicism pervades this book: Fitz Gerald
is satisfied that the world is about him and
that it is good to be alive, that there are
colored flowers to smell, birds to hear,
women to kiss, and work to be done. What
matter if ugliness lurks round the corner,
beauty is still but a step beyond: yesterday
has gone and one must not mourn its pass-
ing; to-day is here and sunlight trellises
the leaves, drips in yellow honey to the
grass; somewhere a butcher-bird is singing
its happy note, the ground is crisp under
marching feet—is it not brave to be alive!
To Fitz Gerald earth is a garden and if it
is wrecked, if Commercialism controls its
ways, if the Puritan still clamors to kill
joy, one must not blame the garden: it
is man’s fault, not the greater Apollo’s.
There are still many great deeds to be done
and many lovely things to be seen.
Most of these verses have already
appeared in The Bulletin and in the
Spinner, but some are new to me; yet
whether new or old each bears the stamp
of beauty, the true poet’s hunger to express
his thoughts in magic words. If I had my
way I would quote the whole book from
beginning to end if only for the pure plea-
sure of repeating its beauty, of quickening
my blood once more with its music, its
courageous philosophy.
Where is our public for poetry? I can-
not conceive anybody living who would
not desire to be surrounded by every great
poet this world has to offer our hearts.
And yet in all our vast Australia I dare
swear there are barely 100 people who
would trouble to buy “The Greater Apollo”
were it put upon the bookstalls, and not
that number who would appreciate its
rich savor to the full. I confess I can-
not understand why. To me there is no-
thing more marvellous than good poetry,
and I would bargain every novel in the
world if I might only keep my little shelf
of heroes into which I am squeezing “The
Greater Apollo” between W. H. Davies’s
“Collected Poems” and my Herrick —noble
company which it fully deserves.
L. PHILLIPS.
Australian Plays
In reading “Columba’s” scheme for the
guidance of Australian playwrights (R.P.
21/4/’27) one is struck over again by what
seems a sort of conspiracy of silence as
to what has already been not only written
but produced. These schemes are put forth
as into a vacuum, instead of in concur-
rence with work already done. Granted
an enormous and immeasurable task re-
mains to be undertaken; but such things
ought to be cumulative, not isolated.
Surely it is fortifying for a new writer to
find himself in the same ranks as others
who have been working and planning for
years!
“Columba” says we must use our abos,
but hesitates to handle them as contem-
poraries. Let him look up Louis Esson’s
one-act play “The Drovers,” and see how
the blacks’ pidgin-talk is used successfully,
in a kind of grotesque poetry, at a crisis
in the lives of bushmen. Not only the talk,
either, but the persistent legend of the
white man’s being re-born black, and vice
versa. (In this way Tom Petrie’s “Remi-
niscences” tells how when the Maroochy
blacks first saw white men they thought
they were ghosts of blacks.)
Then there are legends of our own early
days in Australia. In this subject, Stewart
Mackv’s long play “John Blake,” produced
many times in Melbourne, is a skilfully
woven cento of outstanding scenes, tales so
often re-told that they are part of our life.
There is room in such a dramatic move-
ment for every shade of play, fantastic or
realistic. The first necessity, as “Columba”
says, is, of course, the theatre itself for. a
centre.
Ireland was indeed fortunate in its
legends, so that when its renaissance
dawned there were these old fires to be
revived. Yet the Abbey Theatre drama-
tists have been far from consistent in using
that old material. I can remember when
Lennox Robinson first had one of his
modern realistic plays produced. It was
startling to a movement concerned chiefly
with the ancient glories of Finn or the
modern romantic outlook of Synge. (This
is not a time to argue about the word
“romantic.”) Yeats, when interviewed,
said it might prove necessary to evict Len-
nox Robinson from the Abbey’s Parnassus,
but this was not done, and so much the
better in the end.
Here in Australia we must use what
material we have, and wonderful and varied
enough it is, from Broome to Melbourne
and Cape York to the Leeuwin. And when
some painful inch of ground is gained, it
must not be lost by total forgetfulness.
N.Q.
Endemic Verse
One of our local schoolmasters came
across an old Bulletin lately. The Red
Page contained a number of nursery
rhymes, so he took them to the best judges
—the infants at his school. Their verdict
was practically unanimous—“ Three ha’pence
and tuppence” won easily. Children are
mercenary.
But at the lunch hour through his office
window came floating in joyous chant two
gems, racy, native of the soil, and not even
remotely suggesting the midnight oil:
There was a little man went fishing in a
hole,
He had a little line and the 'fracteur he had
stole,
He gotter little bite and he made a sudden
grab, .
And, lor lumme, in a minute he caught a
bonser crab!
He took the “bonser” home and put it on
the kitchen floor, scaring his missus into
a faint. Then: —
In came a policeman, with a blimey broom,
He chased the blimey crab all over the blimey
room,
Singing “Hey Jimmy, ho Jimmy, come alonga
me,”
Singing “Hey Jimmy, ho Jimmy J-o-h-n-
-s-o-n.”
Not another poet in the world could asso-
ciate a policeman with a broom and “put
it across.” Let us hope he collected the
“little man” who went fishing with “ ’frac-
teur.” But listen:—
Fatty and Skinny went gathering nutz,
Skinny give Fatty a kick in the gutz,
Sez Skinny to Fatty, “.Ter want any more?”
“No, thank yer,” sez F'atty, “me gutz is too
sore!”
There is a haunting, mellifluous, melancholy
lilt to that. Poor Fatty! The accent
should be bold and"' emphatic on “gutz”
wherever it occurs.
Our infant schools are unexplored fields.
Collections could be made if head teachers
would interest themselves. A volume of
real Australian unrestrained effort would
result. Try another: —
Hullo, hullo, hullo, sir,
Meet me at the grocer.
Oh, sir, no, sir,
’Cause I got a cold, sir.
Where’d jer get the cold, sir?
Up the Northern Pole, sir.
Wliatjer doing up there, sir?
Catching polar bear, sir.
How many did ybr catch, sir?
One, sir ; two, sir; three, sir—out!
The one who is “out” is, presumably, “it.”
Now where and how the deuce do these
things originate?

A Satchel of Books
The Up-grade, by George Gibbs (Apple-
ton; Dymock’s). An interesting novel that,
presents fairly the problem of the American
woman in the industrial world.
From Nine to Nine, by Leo Perutz (John
Lane). From the German. The scene is
laid in Vienna and, as with “The Marquis
of Bolivar,” its action moves swiftly.
Evolution Disproved, by William A. Wil-
liams. The basis of the main body of dis-
proof is the infallibility of the Biblical re-
cord. So you get no farther forward.
This Believing World, by Lewis Browne
(Benn). A simple account of the great re-
ligions of mankind, with numerous illustra-
tion and maps. Presents its subject in a
popular style.
Hibiscus Heart, by M. Forrest (Hutchin-
son). Readers of the Woman’s Mirror, in
whose pages this story appeared in serial
form, will agree that its interest and faith-
ful local color well warranted London publi-
cation.
Murder in the Maze, by J. J. Connington
(Benn). Another detective story. Since
two simultaneous murders may not be suffi-
cient fuel for the lire, the author throws in
a burglary and a forged cheque. He would
be a glutton who called for more.
Britain Looks Forward (Benn). A col-
lection of articles by competent authorities
on British industrial problems with an intro-
duction by Sir Alfred Robbins. The intent
is to combat any idea that the British nation
may now be counted as “down and out.
The Evolution of Modern Capitalism, by
John A. Hobson (Walter Scott Publishing
Co.). A new and revised edition of the
work forming one of the Contemporary
Science series. This study of machine pro-
duction has passed through many editions
and is now brought up to date.
Rogues and Vagabonds of Dickens, by
Walter Dexter (Cecil Palmer). Mr. Dexter
lias omitted, among others. Sikes and Hor-
tense, the French maid to Lady Dedlock.
On the other hand, he has included Mrs.
.Tarley, who was rather saint than sinner,
but he makes amends by dubbing her “the
beloved vagabond.” Well compiled and excel-
lently presented.
The Return of Blackshirt, by Bruce
Graeme (Fislier Unwin). The author of
“Blackshirt,” which proved an acceptabl
novel to lovers of the detective story, has
pulled his hero out of the virtuous domestic
life that had rewarded his reformation, and
here is again embroiled in a network o
crime.
Hellas, the Forerunner, by H. W. House-
hold (Dent). “I have often thought, says
the writer, “that history, for all but tne
scholar, is overloaded with facts that have
little significance, and that for all purposes
but those of an examiner (whose melancholy
fate it is to do so much harm to education)
are irrelevant.” The student cannot see
the wood for the trees. History should, m
the author’s opinion, be regarded as philo-
sophy teaching by example. A,t. the present
time the world has reached a stage,
and it is well to remember that man s pro-
gress, material and intellectual, has its tides
like the ocean. There is flow and ebb, and
an intelligent study of the rise and tall ot a
great people has its lessons. Without some
intelligent, knowledge of. Greek history and
thought no man’s education is complete, toi
it embraces the most brilliant period ot the
human race. Attractively written and well
worth reading.
The Plutocrat, by Booth Tarkington
(Heinemann). The author can be depended
on for a good yarn. This novel revolves
around the character of Mr. Tinker, million-
aire, a philistine of the frankly commercial
world, big of heart as he is of pocket and
without a trace of snobbery. About this
amusing but lovable personality the author
gathers a body of incident full of genial
humor.
Disraeli, by D. L. Murray (Benn). With-
out possessing charm of literary style, the
author has the advantage of a Semitic strain
which enables him to enter with sympathy
into the complex elements making up the
personality of Dizzy—-dramatic, brilliant,
shrewd and worldly. He offers his work as
a simple “impression” of a bewildering career.
The impression, however, covers a wide field,
its political interest dating from the day
when a strange figure rose in the Commons.
“It was dressed in a bottle-green frock-coat
and loudly patterned pantaloons and dis-
played on its waistcoat as in a pawnshop
window a glittering cuirass of chains. A
face pallid with excitement was lit by burn-
ing black eyes, and crowned with oiled curls
that fell upon the cheek.” In the laughter
and uproar that greeted the maiden speech
a voice startled the House by its fury in
the parting words: “I sit down now, but the
time will come when you will hear me. ’
The drama closes witli the Earl of Reaeons-
field the confidant and adviser of the Queen
of England and Empress of India. “Victoria
and he had many affinities,” Mr. Murray sug-
gests. “Both were romantic temperaments,
though both have been ridiculed for the lack
of taste that revealed itself as much in their
language and their emotional self-expression
as in their dress, their homes and their
artistic sympathies. .. . Like her he read
history much as the schoolboy does —exclu-
sively in terms of glory.”

Rain-murmurings The wind whines and

As a poor dog whose lord has ceased to
care
For faithful things like dogs. And you,

With little firclit face and fire-gold hair,
Curled like a kitten in an easy chair,
Who purrs for stroking. Velvet-soft —and

Who knows, behind your yellow eyes what

May serve you? Hark! The little whine
of rain!
Rose-red azaleas around you bend ;
Soft from your lamp tlie rose-red shadows

As panther firelight leaps along the

Outside, the small wind shakes its dripping

Stifling a little whimper in its throat.

The Green Farm.
As up hill and down hill
A lone man I wandered
I came to a green farm
When day was half-squandered ;
And there at its doorway—-
A true story this is—
A slim girl was standing
With lips made for kisses.
The look in her big eyes
It set me a-thinking
Of cream and of honey
And wine good for drinking;
Heart-warm was the greeting,
The kind words she uttered;
“Gome, taste of my new milk
And bread thickly buttered.”
Her words gave me tooth-edge,
My hunger awaking,
For milk from her red cows
And bread of her baking;
An angel I thought her,
An angel or fairy,
As new bread she brought me
And milk from her dairy.
Now when I had drunken
My fill, and had eaten —
Blest, blest be her red cows,
Her bread, white and wlieaten !
She talked of her day’s work,
Of churning and baking,
And bade me a good-day,
My thanks lightly taking.
Long, long I’ll remember
That angel, that fairy,
The bread from her oven,
The milk from her dairy;
And long I’ll remember
When counting past blisses,
Her big eyes and kind words
. And lips made for kisses.

The Rebel.
We stole the land, decking her with bright
flowers,
Our cities shimmering jewels in soft night
hours;
Set smug, white fences on her empty spaces
And cleared strange scrubs for cheap
suburban graces.
Her .great wild pastures claimed we for our
own,
On many a barren stretch the fields lie sown ;
The silver waters of a thousand streams
Harnessed to yield the power of our dreams.
Smooth pavings run where once the pioneers
Struggled alone with bitter hopes and fears;
Our trains, our trams, climb now the curving
hill
That thirty years ago was virgin still.
Never a plain so lone or post so far
But some gaunt settler there has lit his star.
We stole the land, decking her with bright
flowers —
Sometimes, I wonder, is she really ours?
Let but a torrent fall, swift rivers rise;
A spark—great forests smoulder to the skies,
As if amid a whirl of flood and flame
Slumbered a spirit that no man might tame.
Take for a simile a savage child
Borne from the shadow of its native wild,
With shingled locks and silken frock and
hose
And satin slippers squeezed on spreading
toes —
Beneath the docile smile, the shimmering
dress,
Lingers no faint and yearning restlessness?
Sometimes, I fancy, when the streets at night
Are lit by many a scintillating light,
Amid the tapping that the high heels beat
I hear the slinking pad of naked feet!
The spirit of the land, Whose native trees
Whisper to her such radiant mysteries,
Who, for the wattle’s gold, a parrot’s wing.
Would barter every glowing man-made thing.
We plan and hope and build our wond’rous
dreams,
Our politics and laws and subtle schemes;
Then, in an instant, carelessly aside,
A thousand glittering hopes are scattered
wide.
We stole the land, decking her with bright
flowers —
Sometimes, I wonder, is she really ours?

“Only One More Day.”
(A chanty for the Old Man’s ears.)
We’re three months out on a burgoo barque
And we’ve scraped her beef-casks clean,
There’s a necklace o’ bones on her figure-
head
That says we're from Aberdeen.
But we'll raise the good old chanty, boys,
And heave till our hides sweat blood,
For in one day more our chains will roar
As our hook finds the Sydney mud.
Only one day more, my bullies,
One day more!
Oh, rock and roll us o-ver
For one day more!
We coaxed her over the breathless line
When her decks were as ’ot as ’Ell,
And we cursed as we swung her yards
around
To each puff that arose and fell.
We shivered like dogs in our slop-chest duds
When running our Easting down,
With our decks awash; but soon we’ll see
The lights of old Sydney town.
Only one day more, my buckos,
One more day!
Oh, bend your backs and heave, lads,
For one more day.
The cook is weighing the tins of fat
That lie stole from me and you,
The bos'n is blacking the old ’ard ’at
For a stroll round Woolloomooloo;
The steward is giving a harbor shine
To the brass on his pantry door,
And the mate is brushing the long-tailed
coat
He ships when lie goes ashore.
Only one more day, my bullies,
One day more!
Oh, blow us down io Sydney toivn
In one day more!
The Old Man sits in his big saloon
Where lie's making up our pay,
And cursing the cost of sailormeu
At eighteen pence a day;
And the weevily bread we’ve eaten, boys,
Makes his hard old dial look glum
When he thinks of the casks of beef we've
sunk
With never a taste of rum.
Only one day more, my buckos,
One day more!
Oh, tighten your belt and heave her
For one day more!
Old Sails is squatting upon th e poop
With our ensign on his knees,
He’s mending the fly with a bright red patch,
For to-morrow it’ll float in the breeze.
With our anchor down and our number up
We’ll be taking our pleasure ashore,
For the girls are hauling our tow-rope in
With a chorus of “One day more.”
Only one day more, my bullies,
One day more!
Oh, bloio us down to Sydney town
In one day more!

Peccavi!
She passes with her son, while mine, mayhap.
Uncarnate, sees that other, envying
Those rosy knees, and curls, and hands that
cling,
That thread-bare overcoat and ragged cap,
Those small, hard boots that on the pavement
ring—
She passes proudly by with love’s rich spoil
Won forth through deeps of agony and toil:
I shrink who grudged the price, remembering.
Ah, if in some far time, in some far clime,
Warm life, young life, should come to me
again,
Dear God, make me a wiser, braver thing,
With truer, stronger heart, in that far time.
So I may then, through ears and heart and
brain,
Gear my son’s steps upon the pavement ring.

Dead Timber.
The ringbarked trees as ghosts
Blanched in the moonlight stand,
Leaves shed and limbs awry,
A grisly band;
As if, did a wind wake,
They’d sudden move and moan
With the ghosts of birds and bees
That they have known.
But on a Lethean wold
They seem to have come to bide,
Gaunt, naked as the dead
Beyond Time's tide;
As if on them no wind
Could blow, no sun could pour
His light, but a moon would shine
For evermore.
As on the Stygian strand
The trees that have died here
May in a phantom life
Still reappear;
And many an old ghost may
Recall, when earth was young,
llow in the boughs the birds
Divinely sung.

THE SECOND MORTGAGE.
In Queensland and N. S. Wales the Fair
Rents laws stay on and are regarded as
permanent, though in other States they
were merely temporary Avar expedients. The
object of the law, as worked in the Ma
State anyhow, is to make rents Ioav for
the benefit of tenants, and much joy has
been expressed at the injury done to the
landlord and the “capitalist.” Lack of re-
striction might have induced those people
to over-build and make the “house to let”
a drug in the market, as has chanced before.
Violent restriction naturally caused them to
go out of the business, though something
is still done in the running up of expensive
fiats, where the baby is a nuisance. The
professional landlord ceased to cater for the
new crowd of would-be small-home tenants,
and this is a serious matter, as Sydney
gained 250,000 extra inhabitants between
1915 and 1925, and even the Rest of the
State gained a few. But the professional
builder runs up homes for sale at a good
pace, and with dear land and slow work-
manship they cost a remarkable lot. That
would be a matter of great importance if
the builder expected to be collecting rents
and skirmishing round for tenants years
hence; but, thanks partly to a complicated
system of finance which has grown up and
partly to the advent of a new type of
middleman, he doesn’t expect anything of
the kind, and cost is of minor importance
to him.
* * * *
To illustrate the position The Bulletin
gives a free advertisement to a new home-
finance company which is projecting itself.
It is nominally a million-pound concern,
but it may grow. The preference capital
is to collect a 9 per cent, cumulative prefer-
ence dividend, and there should not be
the slightest difficulty about earning it in
boom times while the Fair Rents law lasts,
and for some time afterwards. The ordinary
capital should receive much more than 9
per cent, when the show gets into full
swing and while the Fair Rents Act holds
good. Some extracts from the prospectus
follow:
t “The demand is so great and the needs of
the builder so pressing that a high rate of
discounting is readily paid in order to secure
prompt financing. The average builder, being
unable to carry the heavy financial respon-
sibility of his own mortgages, which would
involve large capital resources, has to seek
some means of discounting so as to release
lxis capital for further operations.
“A small private company dealing in second
mortgages paid a dividend of over 30 per
cent, last year. Australian Mortgages,
Limited, with its ample capital, can earn
much more than this. ... Its earnings should
range from 20 per cent, to 40 per cent, per
annum....
“The directors have themselves been hand-
ling for years a considerable amount of the
class of business proposed by the company,
and they have discounted second mortgages
on terms varying from 24 per cent, to 20
per cent....
“There is also the security of the owner,
who is liable for any deficiency, and there
is a further security in the fact that every
•transaction will be insured with a first-class
insurance company against any loss that
might arise from any cause whatever.”
It is no doubt legitimate business as things
stand, but the stand of things is crazy and
artificial. It arises through the famine in
modest rentable homes, and that is mainly
due to the fool of a law.
■f :|: * *
. A perfectK familiar example of the local
fauna is the male human with a moderate
income, one or two hundred pounds saved,
and a desire for a home. The difficulty of
renting his kind of home often drives him
to purchase on the long-hire system. His
savings cover a little of the cost. Half,
or even a trifle more, may be raised on
a first mortgage at perhaps 7 per cent.
The easiest way to fill the gap is to give
the builder a second mortgage at 10 per
cent, for the difference, and it isn’t a very
long-dated document even on those terms,
for a possible slump must always be con-
sidered. As the builder hasn’t a boundless
fortune to lock up, his remedy is to sell,
or discount, his secondary security “on
terms varying from 24 per cent, to 29 per
cent.” If he doesn’t expect to get more
than £75 for each £lOO of his bond, it is
plain that he must, for his own protection,
add £25 to each £75 of the amount named
in the bond, and that means that if the
amount of actual value not covered by the
buyer’s money and the first-mortgage
money is £450. the second mortgage will
be for £6OO. It may be for more, as the
discount is apparently as high at times as
29 per cent. Having completed the trans-
action, the buyer probably finds that his
interest and repairs and rates bill is very
much ahead of any reasonable rent, and
until he removes some of the overburden
he may, instead of owning a home, own
less than a mere tenant would. For the
remark that “there is always the security
of the owner, who is liable for any defici-
ency,” is a reminder that he has pawned
his future and his miscellaneous belongings
ns well as his domicile. Also the cost of
mortgage renewals lias to be considered.
* * * *
It can’t be said that any of the parties
involved is taking his fellow-creature down,
or that all of them put together could find
a remedy. The would-be tenant can’t be-
come a tenant if there is no landlord. He
can’t produce enough money of his own
to manage without a second mortgagee
if he hasn’t got it to produce. And the
builder who holds the second mortgage
must realise on it. The discount of “24
per cent, to 29 per cent.” may seem exor-
bitant, but there are big risks to be faced
—the collapse of 1890-93 isn’t forgotten.
A good deal is talked of gigantic schemes
by which Government is to find millions
of other people’s money, and make loans
on mortgage to the extent of 90 or even
100 per cent, of the price of the shack.
But money is hard to get, and the price
of the Government shack would probably
be so high that the apparent relief would
be no relief at all. And no such scheme
directly touches the lettable house, after all.
Relief from the famine in that class of
house is only to be got from encouraging
instead of discouraging the building of it.
THE BUSINESS OF A CROWN.
The connection of royalty with patriotism
goes back to the days in the cave when
Blubgem, after cuffing his unruly brood
of men-children into submission for 16 or
17 years, found his wind was getting short.
He had to use his head instead of his
hands then, for the brats were getting wide
of chest and heavy of arm. He had trouble
with his daughters too. The young blades
from the tribe of Biffem who came court-
ing in the twilight filled their heads with
vain ideas. It was at that stage that
Bludgem, after having a private seance
with such gods as he knew, found a meta-
physical. basis for his job as boss. His
tenure wasn’t entirely metaphysical either.
He knew more than the young ones, and
his knowledge (except for those superstitious
killings of hens and young goats) was en-
tirely practical. As a food-getter he had
no peer among his offspring until he was
very old indeed; and after he had taken
the precaution of telling his young men and
women that a big black thing would spring
out of the forest and mangle them unless
they followed his advice, he did not have
much trouble. The old woman was a bit
fractious sometimes, but a 31b. rock was
all the metaphysics she needed to make
her realise that her husband was a man to
be taken seriously.
* * * *
The tribe grew and the cunningest grand-
dad. established a suzerainty over the other
old men by demonstrating that he had not
only more cows, hens and children, but a
special revelation from the most awe-inspir-
ing of the gods, nominating him for leader-
ship. Then there came a time when the
tribe got so rich in children and in the cows
and hens from which they drew their sus-
tenance that it was able, at times of the
moon decreed by the cunningest grand-
dad, to sally out and give other tribes a
mauling. The men were killed and eaten
and the women taken to wife. So the tribe
grew till it dominated a wide tract of coun-
try, and populated it. It was recognised
by all that the oldest grand-dad held his
job as chief because he was cunning. The
tribes of a little group of countries in the
far North seized on that idea—sceptics that
they were —when they forged the name for
the old man who invented and adminis-
tered the tribal laws. They called him
“the Cunning.” Folk on the mainland of
Europe cherish the term still in the form
of “konig,” and the islanders in the-vicinity
have shortened it to “king.”
* * £ Ss
It was never much of a job, this of being
a king. Quite early in the history of king-
doms old men who noticed that kings led
short and bloody lives, owing to the fre-
quency of quarrels about their degree of
kingliness, began to say that the one thing
the country needed more than anything
else was stability and a return to normalcy.
So they collected all the chooks they could
beg, borrow or steal, made a magic that
lasted over a week—mead helped—and
came back pale and trembling to announce
that in future the eldest son of the king
would automatically take over the job.
Then they gathered round the youngster
and gave him advice, and warned him of
what would happen if he didn’t take it, and
that was the birth of constitutional mon-
archy. There was a lot more peace in the
land, and the old men began to discover
that they really did all the ruling and took
only a small part of the responsi-
bilitjG This persuaded them that kings
have a divine right to rule. Soon, how-
ever, there came a revolt of youth, and
the old men retired to their fastnesses to
apply herbs to their cuts and bruises. They
came out nine days later to say that boys
will be boys and that the only satisfactory
way to settle differences between the young
and the old is at a round table.' The young
fellows, who were stronger on brawn than
brain, said it would be all right in future
if they were consulted as to the selection
of his Majesty’s advisers. After that a
pair of big biceps carried a vote, and de-
mocracy was born.
❖ jH
There came a time when brains began to
develop earlier, and the old men never
knew when some young upstart might break
into the game with a new religion or a new
sort of politics and make trouble with a
gang of larrikins. So they began to take
the youngsters into the Cabinet. The
youngsters, being full of pride, used to
get so puffed up that they said “Pooh” to
divine rights and grabbed the kingship
whenever they could get sufficient rabble
to follow them. That sort of thing wasn’t
good for the country. In no time the place
was a seething mass of hostile gangs, and
when simple-minded men from overseas,
who hadn’t got beyond the idea of an
hereditary king and the looting of small
tribes, gave them a look-over, they were
not in a position to mobilise an effective
defensive force. Thinking it over after-
wards they said “Unity is strength,” and
thereafter, with occasional lapses into revo-
lution and anarchy, the tribes have stuck
to the idea of a figurehead. So far a
better idea has not been discovered.
A visit from a king’s son and daughter-in-
law is regarded by almost all hands in this
day and generation as a thing that, tends
to make an Empire homogeneous. The
Empire in question isn’t quite what Julius
Caesar would have understood by the term,
but it hangs together, and finds it easier
to hang together because the human being
at the head of the nation doesn’t play
politics and wasn’t elected by any section.
It finds his sons are likeable young men,
and gets a vicarious pride out of the fact
that they travel in pomp and circumstance
that a Solomon in all his glory never
dreamed of. It is all so absurd and illogical
on the surface—and so extraordinarily solid
and practical underneath. In that respect
it differs from a good deal of the rest of
our system of government, which is so
logical on the surface and so rotten under-
neath.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
No Conscription!
Echoes of the stormy days of 1914-18, when
a large-sized war caused revolutions in
Europe and split Australia's youngest poli-
tical party, reverberated in Canberra when
the Conference of Labor delegates com-
menced to talk ‘ about national affairs. It
was all plain sailing for a while. A reso-
lution declared handsomely in favor of “the
cultivation of Australian sentiment,” and
everyone was solid for “the maintenance of
a White Australia.” There was also put
into the mouths of delegates a piece about
“the development of an enlightened and
self-reliant community with complete self-
government as part of the British Com-
munity of Nations.” That last sentence prob-
ably caused some of the oldsters a moment
or two of thought. After all, if one is a
partner in the firm, one can’t always act
independently of the other partners in busi-
ness, matters, particularly if those business
matters include the subject of defending the
firm’s trade—not to mention such trifles as
protecting the hearths and homes of the
millions of members of the firm against
people who might think that the best way
of getting rid of a ■ dangerous competitor
would be to exterminate him or terrorise
him.
However, vague platitudes are always in
order when units of an Empire begin to
philosophise about their part in the busi-
ness,; and Labor conferences can’t be
expected to dodge all the pitfalls that beset
such discussions. But they can be expected
to have a little commonsense, even if
they Hive in a country that has never been
invaded. The men who made the Aus-
tralian, Labor party saw that, whether they
realised their notions of an ideal State or
not, Australia would stand in need of
defence for quite a long time, and they put
compulsory military training on their plat-
form. The gentlemen who run the present
government of Russia, such as it is, recog-
nised at once that the need for defence
becomes, greatest when a State embarks
upon political experiments that exalt the
lowly and debase the high. The Soviet
citizen of military age goes into the army
whether he wants to or not, and the Soviet
wouldn’t have held together this long had
it not been that the thing has claws.
Robespierre, Danton and Marat hadn’t any
time for the citizen whose ideas of liberty,
fraternity and equality conflicted with the
necessity for defending the republic. But
the Canberra Conference has come to the
conclusion that defence is entirely a bour-
geois affair. So there’s to be no more con-
scription, either for home or foreign service
—if Labor gets into Federal power again
and remembers all that its multifarious con-
ferences have decided upon.
However, everybody over 40 round the
conference table knew well enough, if he
had any sense, that peace-time resolutions
about war don’t govern what happens in
war-time. The only thing any self-respect-
ing Government can do if a war comes
along, and the country is even remotely
threatened with invasion, is to take all
.such steps as are humanly practicable to
avert the threat. And about the first thing
that is done in such a case is to bring com-
pulsion upon men to defend their country.
Knowing that to be the hard, sad fact,
people of intelligence believe that it if
well that the men who are to be called upon
to fight should know how to do it. And
the only way to insure that is to compel
all citizens of military age to undergo mili-
tary training.

The Triumph of the Machine.
The expected, not to say inevitable, that
happened at Warringah on Saturday ought
to show Nationalists the folly of surrender-
ing their self-governing rights to a handful
of unelected and unrepresentative people
whose names even most of them don’t know.
With preferential voting in practice, pre-
selection, as it is grandiloquently called,
. never is necessary; in such a case as War-
ringah it is a dangerous invasion of popular
rights.
The cry, of course, is that, Labor being
united, anti-Labor must have unity too.
But whose unity? We have seen what has
happened on the Labor side through the
rank and file surrendering their self-govern-
ing rights in the unions and out of them
to a few Tom Walshes and Jacob Johar-
sons; the Nationalists themselves have been
demanding that there shall be no strike, lor
instance, without a ballot of the whole or
the members concerned. And we have seen
Parliaments filled not by genuine working
men, but by office-men who represent cliques
that spend the workers’ substance in fign -
ing for their own benefit and aggrandise-
ment. The Nationalists are going in pre-
cisely the same direction; and the rank ana
file of the party will wake up presently to
find that their alleged representatives are
merely the tools of big predatory nr e "
rests. It hasn’t got quite that far
when big predatory interests see how obe -
ent to the machine the bulk of the Nation


Mist, party are, the machine will certainly
be captured.
And the tragedy—or the joke—of it all is
that it was to avoid this very thing that
the preferential-voting system was solemnly
introduced.
*
The Bolshevik and the Raid.
Some people of an apologetic turn are wail-
ing about the wrong done to the Soviet
because certain Russian trading premises in
London were searched for stolen British
State secrets believed to be concealed there.
There seems very little in it. Though the
proceedings were large and sensational,
they don’t differ in principle from a raid
on a Dago’s wineshop owing to a suspicion
of “receiving.” Neither the big -warehouse
nor the obscure winery enjoys any diplo-
matic immunity.
Even the immunity conferred on an am-
bassador and his staff and home was only
clearly defined in Britain when Anne was
on the throne, it being then agreed that the
Russian envoy, who was apparently an in-
solvent or penurious beggar, shouldn’t be
again arrested for debt. It wasn’t unlimited
immunity by any means. A far-back pre-
cedent was that of certain Greeks who
dropped a Persian embassy down a well,
where, presumably, it still remains. In 1914
the Russian ambassador, leaving Berlin
under a rain of insults, and threatened
with detention unless the price of his special
train Was forthcoming in coin, probably
thought that his diplomatic immunity was
worn rather thin. The Sovieteers attacked
i he British embassy at Petrograd in 1918.
end committed murder there, and at Mos-
cow in recent days they developed a nasty
way of picketing the residence of the British
Charge d’Affaires, molesting his visitors
and demanding to know their business. So,
in the almost impossible event of the
British Government contemplating any com-
pensation for the Soviet’s allegedly damaged
feelings, it is hoped that it will tell that
truculent body that there is a large contra
account, and that it had better deduct the
trifle from the thousand millions or so of the
repudiated debt which it owes J. Bull, and
send along a cheque for the balance.
The Malodorous Maroubra Business.
When piloting a bill through the N.S.W. .
Assembly a few months ago, Chief-Secre-
tary Lazzarini explicitly declared that
there was “no proposition to register any
new racecourse in or near Sydney.” Now,
however, we find items like this:—
“Many of the leading trainers and owners
were entertained by the directors of
Maroubra Speedway, Ltd., when the
proposals for providing trotting at the
Speedway were explained by the man-
aging director, Mr. A. AY. Anderson, and
his co-directors. It was stated that the com-
pany intended to hold 20 meetings at night
in the year. A five-furlong track, 66ft. wide,
with two straights, had been designed, and it
was hoped to make a start with the racing
in October. Large prizes would be given....
Young Air. Leslie McDonald, who headed
the Sydney reinsmen’s list for four years, gave
a good lead to his confreres when he said that
die company had only .to turn on the lights,
;»pen its gates, and the public would flock
into the Speedway. .. . The license which Air.
Anderson obtained for his company is for
20 dates yearly, and is the only license
granted by the Government for about a
ouarter of a century at Sydney.”
So a Labor Government is burdening
Sydney with another proprietary race-
course, which in the last resort will depend
on the workers’ craze for betting, and in a
surf-bathing suburb hitherto free from the
gambling taint at that! It is enough to
make the founders of the party, who
dreamed great dreams of what Labor Gov-
ernments woidd accomplish for the masses,
turn in their graves.
But. what is Opposition-leader Bavin
going to do about it? Mr. Bavin has made
no secret of his belief that there should be
a lot less racing in Sydney instead of more.
In the course of 12 months he will very
probably be Premier. As Premier he will
have the power to veto the conversion of
the Maroubra Speedway into a legalised
gambling pit. As leader of the Oppo-
sition he has a right to say that he will
not be bound by proceedings which are a
sequel to the withholding of material facts
from Parliament’s knowledge. A few words
on such lines would nip this Maroubra
scandal in the bud.
♦
Ashmead Bartlett on Gallipoli.
The Peace Prize for 1927 ought to go to
Ashmead Bartlett, whose articles purport-
ing to be based on the private diary he
kept during the Gallipoli campaign em-
body the most unsparing condemnation of
war that has yet issued from the 1914-18
upheaval. Yet he certainly didn’t intend
anything of the kind. His aim seems prin-
cipally to be to justify the cabal against lan
Hamilton that he took so energetic a part
m forming. The relations between the two
men can never have been very cordial—
no commanding officer could be expected
G welcome fatherly advice from a news-
paper correspondent, however many titled
and influential relatives that correspondent
Possessed, nor would Hamilton’s love for
bis mentor be increased when events proved
* bat the amateur was right and Iho profes-
sional wrong.
The main grounds of the charges Bartlett
brings against the High Command at Gal-
lipoli are familiar enough. French and
Italian tacticians questioned, at the time,
tne soundness of the naval plans, the choice
°f the points of attack, and the attempts
to storm the enemy’s most strongly-held
positions instead of searching for the weak
links of the defences. But those criticisms
were not given much weight in England,
even by those few to whom they filtered
through. From Gallipoli came encouraging
dispatches, flanked by glowing accounts
from the press correspondents, Bartlett
among them. He confesses quite frankly
that he took part in the game of saying
that everything was all right when every-
thing was all wrong. He could either send
home that sort of stuff or send nothing,
and the newspapers that had sent him out
had a right to a run for their money. So
he gave them a run, and now gives an
ironic parody of the sort of soothing-syrup
he used to purvey. But he was not content
to be solely a purveyor of lies. He smug-
gled to England a letter to Asquith which,
in effect, was a strong plea for the recall
of Hamilton on the grounds that the
General’s muddles and mismanagement had
utterly destroyed the confidence, if not the
morale, of the forces under him. It is left
to be inferred that the evacuation, 10 weeks
after the letter reached its destination, was
ordered owing to Bartlett’s disclosures.
The most interesting feature of the cor-
respondent’s story of the great part he
played in making history is his unveiled
contempt for the stupidity of the men who
controlled the destinies of the Anzacs. Their
callousness revolts him. Even his hero,
Winston Churchill, does not escape. He
mentions that G.H.Q. “disliked Birdwood,
and were very jealous of him,” and adds
significantly, “Politics is a dirty game, but
the inner life of this Army is dirtier still.”
He is unrestrained in his admiration for
the Australian troops, and pays them a
very high tribute. The sacrifice of such
splendid fellows on the altar of stupidity
and inefficiency—as he deemed it—moves
him to indignation, as well it might. But
what is there that can be done about it?
Nothing! Press correspondents with the
fighting forces in wartime are under mili-
tary rule and discipline, and their messages
are subject to censorship. Hamilton, the
scapegoat of Bartlett's wrath, was a gen-
eral of high repute, rather above the aver-
age of military intelligence by all accounts.
He fought his campaign in a manner that
led to failure, but even Bartlett admits
that it was foredoomed to failure.
If, then, there is any practical maxim to
be got out of the Ash mead Bartlett dis-
closures, it is that there are occasions when
a press correspondent knows more about
war than a better-than-average general. But
though that is quite comforting to an unpre-
pared country like Australia, it wouldn’t be
safe to adopt it as a rule for the guidance of
Governments at war.

Ringhi’s Journey to the Sunset.
If statements made at the recent conference
in Sydney of the Aborigines’ Inland Mission
are true, then Binghi is quickening his
pace towards the sunset. The mission, begun
in 1905, now functions practically through-
out Australia. It is in an excellent position
to collect reliable data, and the figures
quoted by Mrs. L. W. Long, one of the
heads of the mission, may be taken as
fairly accurate. For the year ended June
30, 1926, deaths among the natives actually
within the mission’s purview were 3119.
The total number of natives under super-
vision could not be arrived at, but some
idea of the rate of decrease may be gained
from a “Commonwealth Year Book” table.
That shows a falling off in numbers of the
aboriginal population of Victoria and N.
S. Wales from 1741 in 1921 to 1158 in 1924
—say, one-third in three years. But the
worst feature of the mortality rate as
seen by the mission is that it is highest
among the young children. Fewer are being
born, too, and even in comparatively primi-
tive Centralia young children are notably
scarce.
It may be, as another speaker told the
conference, deplorable that the nation seems
more interested in preserving native fauna
and flora than in saving the abo. from
extinction. But the point is that, flora and
fauna, if unmolested, can fend for them-
selves. Save for the remaining wild tribes
of Arnheim Land perhaps, the Australian
abo. has got far below that capacity. Fenced
off and left to themselves, if that were
practicable, the Arnheim natives might
preserve the race indefinitely. The rest,
on whom the destroying angel of civilisa-
tion has breathed, are as surely doomed as
were the hosts of Sennacherib.

Tire Interests of the Child.
It is a wonderful age for the child. In
the last century it was taken as an axiom
that the home of the parents was the
infant’s best nursery. Perhaps it was and
still is in the well-ordered middle-class
home. But the middle-class home has gone
a bit to wreck, and there are so many homes
that are no class at all. So if things were
left as they were, children would be spawned
in the slums, fed on garbage and thrown
into a drab world to scuffle through it as
best they might; and nobody would worry
much whether they survived or how they
survived.
In the Courts of Law. the Judges clung
tenaciously to the ancient common-law
doctrine that the father had the light to
the custody of his child against the world
—what sort of father he was did not much
trouble their lordships. But the other day in
a N. S. Wales court the Judge calmly set
aside a father and handed his child to an
uncle. “It appears to me,” said S’Honor,
“it would be cruelty to take this child
away from where it appears to be happy.”
It is the new doctrine that sees in the
interests of the child a power that must
prevail against not onty parenthood, but
all the minor issues of the passing day.
O
Queensland’s Northern Railways.
Dear Bulletin, —In writing about “Queens-
land’s Northern Railways” (B. 19/5/’27) Dr.
Jensen seems to be the man on the spot,
and the inaccuracy of the man on the spot
is sometimes very striking. Assuming that
of the £750.000 which the State paid for the
Chillagoe railways and swindle £500,000 at
6 per cent, was debited against the Ethe-
ridge (Almaden to Forsayth) line, which
has closed in disgust, he makes out a case
of grievous wrong. Part, he says, snould
have been charged to some other section.
As a matter of fact, the loan capital
debited against the Almaden to For-
sayth enterprise was only £281,802, and
as the interest charge was £13,526 the
rate was below 5 per cent. The weekly
train which was “always loaded with freight
and passengers and must have paid for its
own running” earned £12,539 in 1925-26, and
the working expenses were £39,303, so it
seems possible to save £26,764 per annum by
closing the route, even though the interest
bill goes on. I heard, however, that storms
did the closure, and that the department
simply decided that it was far too expen-
sive to reconstruct 142 miles of track which
is capable of losing £40.000 altogether inside
12 months. If the closure of the Etheridge
line and the Chillagoe smelters has turned
nearly 1000 men into temporary burdens on
the State at £50,000 a year, that is better
than for them to be permanent burdens at
a great deal more by sticking on at their
old jobs. And if, as alleged, “a Brisbane
daily recently pointed out that only 10
sections of railway out of 60-odd pay,” it
was a very §low old daily. I recently
pointed out that only nine sections of
Queensland railway out of 88 pay.
I sympathise with Dr. Jensen, but the
man who tries to put up any sort of an
apology for any Queensland railway has a
dreadfully hard row to hoe. That mob of
leaderless cars and trucks and dissipated
locomotives, with some rails here and there
to lend color to the picture and a strike in
the middle distance, passes explanation.
—Yours truly, J. E.

Why the Trams Don’t Pay.
Dear Bulletin, —As a N.S.W. tramway
employee, who tries to see both sides, I
am more and more convinced that the
chronic losses made by our department
show that both ends of the service lack
civic sense. While cut-throat - tactics are
used by employer and employed, just so
long will the country have to pay. Why
is every rise in revenue counterbalanced
by increased expenditure? A private firm
woidd want to know, but with the tram-
ways no one greatly cares. For instance,
no one puts in two loop-lines, each 20 yards
long, at Epping junction and Rozelle depot
junction to shift trams after peak loading,
notwithstanding that the delay at those
points costs thousands of pounds every year
in overtime.
And it does not matter that few men
work the 44 hours per week which the award
provides. I repeatedly work 39, 41 and
42 hours, and have to be paid for 44 hours;
and it makes me scratch my head. There
are brains among employers and employees,
and it should be possible for the brains
to combine and at least correctly diagnose
the losses.
The union only worries about non-
essentials, such as Gardens or Seales, while
the real problems are side-tracked. The
abolition of the footboard is as far off as
ever, due in the main to the fact that our
leaders go off on wrong scents. On Easter
Monday, with a 64-mile-an-hour gale blow-
ing, the conductors struggled along 18 inches
of footboard, most of them drenched to
the skin. But no one took any notice.
Meantime a conductor gets killed now and
then, and another gets crippled for life, and
a boy on the offside, trying to dodge his
fare, is swept off by an approaching tram
while he is watching the conductor.
My plea is for closer relations and a
better understanding between employer and
employee, and you, Mr. Everyman, are our
emplover.—Yours, etc., Keg.

Mrs. 1927 Replies to Miss, 1927.
Dear Bulletin, —We three friends, who
have been university women, too, and who
have also practised medicine, science and
teaching, were discussing, among other
things, “N.K.C.’s” letter (B. 5/5/’27). We
are married, and in our twenties, and each
of us has a wee bairn.
We are agreed that any woman with
average brains, and given the opportunity,
could provide for a home; but could she
make one? To make the ideal home, a
woman must be proficient, among other
things, in cooking, sewing, home-decorating,
child-welfare and home-nursing. She must
be businesslike in her dealings with trades-
people. She must be a pal to her husband
and children, and be ready to advise and
sympathise with them in their troubles, and
to share their joys. She must keep abreast
of the times, and be intelligently interested
in the outside world. Also it is important
that she should know how to fill in the
leisure moments not only of herself, but
also of her family. The making of the
ideal home is not easy. No woman need
think it beneath her.
What “Miss 1927” seems to kick against
and think quite unnecessary is the main
essential in home-making. We are agreed
that it is what has proved most difficult
for us. It is self-sacrifice. To “Miss 1927”
self-sacrifice seems unfair. Why, she sug-
gests, should woman have not only.to sacri-
fice her pleasures but also to suffer the most
excruciating agony to bear her child? But
is not this, after all, one of women’s privi-
leges? Is not self-sacrifice the highest ideal
of everyone? Don’t all decent men rever-
ence women for this very thing?
Perhaps a woman’s academic training
seems to be wasted when she marries. We
do not think so. In our cases the doctor
married a doctor, the scientist an engineer
and the schoolteacher a clerk, and we have
found that our education has benefited our
husbands and children. Then we feel that
should anything happen to the bread-
winner we are capable of carrying on. Are
we not entering on and participating in the
greatest experience of a human being’s life?
—Yours, etc., Mrs. 1927.

Australia with Its Coat Oft.
Hadfield’s (Australia), Ltd., started 10 years
ago with a capital of £40,000 and with a
present paid capital of £400,000. has turned
out a 60 x 48 rock-crusher, which is the
largest stone-reduction instrument yet made
in the British Empire. It weighs 100 tons
and, fitted with jaws of manganese steel,
can crush 700 tons of stone in an hour.
That fact of itself has interest, but its
implications are still more interesting. The
new crusher goes to a N.S.W. quarry, its
installation being an effort to meet vast!}'
increased labor costs. In short, the engineer
is the man who is readjusting the burdens
imposed by the politicians—burdens which
industry would, without his help, find un-
bearable. His importance in the modern
scheme of things simply cannot be over-
estimated.
Hadfield’s achievement is notable, too,
because it was said that the production of
such goods was impossible in Australia.
Very big castings, certainly, were required
for the job; but if others could make them,
why not Australia? Of course there was no
reason—except a modesty that might be mis-
taken sometimes for cowardice. It is mainly
the good Australian engineer who has
broken down this Australian shyness. Down
to a few years ago most of the engineering
works of the Commonwealth—other than
certain specialised industries, such as the
making of harvesters—were merely assembly
works, dependent to a very large extent
on imported parts. To-day Australian in-
dustry is supplying Australia with practi-
cally every description of machine, and is
making practically every sort of repair to
imported machinery. And very often it is
improving substantially the output capacity
of the tinkered machine by new Australian-
conceived devices.

Finger-Printery.
After long consideration of ballot-boxes
which have been tampered with, dead
bodies left in cloak-rooms at railway
stations, wandering persons who have mis-
laid their memories, and similar subjects,
The Bulletin is convinced that the neglect
to make general use of the finger-print
system is a blot on our civilisation. Life
would be wonderfully simplified if every
child’s paw record was taken on entering
school, if not earlier, and every adult’s on
becoming eligible to vote. In addition, a
fresh record might be taken when one
marries, or leaves the country, or enters or
re-enters the country.
The familiar declaration that the pro-
posed departure would be an outrage on
the liberty of the subject may be left out.
Law calls on the subject on many occa-
sions to put his record on paper per hand
with a pen in it, and it is no more de-
grading to do it per hand without a pen in
it, though it is certainly more dangerous at
times, the counterfeiting of a finger-]>rint
being very difficult, though perhaps not
quite impossible—not in fiction, anyhow.
Since a long time back the average human
being, however retiring, has undergone
registration, like a dog, at least thrice in
a lifetime, at birth, marriage and death,
and if he can put up with that he can
stand a lot. The use of finger-prints is
said to date among Japanese and Chinese
from time immemorial, though European
people only began to sit up and take notice
of the science after Galton published his
work on “Finger-Prints” in 1892-93.
For detective purposes universal finger-
printery might fall short in the case of the
lady who is left in a box at the cloak-room.
(It is almost always a lady, and the habit
of leaving her in the cloak-room seems
incurable, while the habit of calling for
her when she would be much better left is
more prevalent than might be expected.)
The proofs of the victim’s identity might be
sawn off, and the criminal might wear
gloves and exercise superhuman care, though
criminals are not a very bright lot. But
in the matter of the murder done in a
hurry, the burglary done by a new hand
or a new arrival, the “found dead,” the
bigamist and many others, an extensive
field of usefulness presents itself.
Another field, as already mentioned, is
the preservation of the secrecy of the ballot.
In many, places which are removed from the
full glare of publicity, an impression pre-
vails that there is not now enough secrecy
left to be worth mentioning, and that there
will be less as time goes on. It would be
a satisfaction if there was a chance to
discover, even once in a while, which un-
couth crook had been at the ballot-papers.


OBJECTIVES AND OPPORTUNITIES
“Thrift is more than mere saving. It is more, even, than wise spending.
It is both an hind and a Means to an End—an Objective and a means of
attaining that Objective. >
“We all want our lives so ordered that we can get the best the World has
to offer. But we can’t acquire unless we strive; and we can’t strive intelligently
and effectively without a purpose.
“The foundation of every worth-while purpose is Thrift.”
—John W. Staley.
Given the purpose (and who is so lacking in Ambition that he has no
purpose?) you will find no more effective method of Thrift Practice than the
Savings Account.

POLITICAL
POINTS
In ordinary circumstances the Warringah
by-election would have been a dull contest
between Nat. Federation and A.L.P. nominees,
with the size of the Nat. Fed. majority the
only thing in doubt. Scott Fell’s challenge
to the Nationalist, machine and the circum-
stances which led to the running of two
Labor candidates made it the most, exciting
by-election that Federated Australia has
seen. The introduction of factors and issues
which the machines try to suppress roused
thousands of people from the apathy they
generally show. Warringah, indeed, indi-
cated how much more interesting elections
would be, and how much greater the chances
of getting abler representatives of both sides,
and therefore better government, if the law
banned pre-selection (while permitting
endorsement) where there is obligatory pre-
ferential voting.
Warringah saw the Lang Government
do what The Bulletin hopes yet to see
many other Governments do—when we get
elective Ministries. At one street corner
in Mosman the Premier and Willis, leader
of the Legislative Council, urged the
claims of O’Gorman, the nominee of Seale’s
A.L.P. executive ; at the next several other
State Ministers, with Federal Labor-leader
Charlton and Theodore, thundered against
O’Gorman and his backers, pronouncing
Conway the genuine Laborite. In their
fury the Conroys stooped to the folly of
instructing their supporters to put O’Gorman
last on the list, whereas the Seales placed
Conway second. Both candidates lost their
deposits, but O’Gorman beat Conway by
1120, whereupon the exultant Sealites with-
drew from the peace conference summoned
by the Federal A.L.P. delegates, declaring
that the people were on their side. There
is a possibility that the Lang-Willis-Seale
faction will . drop pre-selection and make
preferential voting compulsory under the
new Electoral Act. If so, the public will
get some good out of the quarrel.
Hogan’s new Vic. Labor Ministry is the
same in personnel as Prendergast’s 1921
team, except that Bob Williams, M.L.C.,
a South JMelb. caterer, has been substituted
for Danny McNamara, M.L.C., organiser
of the A.L.P. in Melb. Allocation of offices,
however, is slightly different. Hogan takes
the Treasury and Markets; Tunnecliffe, the
Railways and Electricity; Lemmon, his old
jobs of Education and Labor; Prendergast
the Chief Sec.’s post; Slater, Law and
Agriculture; Bailey, Lands and Water, as
before; Jones, Works and Mines; and
Beckett, Forests and Health. Cain and
Webber, M’s.L.A., and Disney, M.L.C., are
honoraries, as they were three years ago,
and Williams (No. 12) is also honorary.
So only one extra railway-pass for life will
have to be issued—Beckett has a paid job
instead of an unpaid one.
The election of the 11 Vic. Labor Minis-
ters to act with Hogan took three hours.
One feature of it which will not readily
be forgotten—the thing is so rare nowadays
—was the quixotic unselfishness of the bril-
liant Blackburn in declining to continue the
contest for the sixth salaried Assembly Min-
istership against Prendergast when victory,
with the Attorney-Generalship, was in his
grasp.
For the nine months for which trade
figures have just been issued the Common-
wealth exported £12,410.614 worth less than
in the same period of 1925-26, and imported
£10,138 526 worth more. For the mere
three-quarters of a year the country was,
roughly, £45,000,000 short of paying its
external liabilities (import bills and interest
bills) by its own efforts. The result is seen
in the ever-increasing procession of down-
at-heel Premiers and mendicant Treasurers
whining for money at the rich foreign capi-
talist’s door. If a party would arise to keep
the doctrine of More Work persistently be-
fore the community it might be a voice
crying in the wilderness, but that is better
than a wilderness with no voice in it.
There is still occasional talk about start-
ing a Diamond Keg or something of the
sort in N.S.W., as a rival to Queensland’s
Golden Casket. To judge by the destinations
MAKING A REAL SPORT OF IT.
“‘The bookmaker must be introduced into flying as in horseracing,’ said Sir Alan Cobham, the
famous airman, at an air-display in England last week.”
BAR-V ON: “Ten ter one!—ten ter one the fat feller reaches the ground first!”
of the big prizes a lot of N.S.W. money
goes to Queensland for a gamble, and over
40 per cent, of it stays there, as donations
to Queensland hospitals (27 per cent.) and
expenses (13 per cent.). The State Govern-
ment at Brisbane takes a bit for itself;
£32 500 in 1926. The Federal Government
used to tax a little also, but it gave up the
habit. There is no method by which the
Lang Ministry can keep the local money at
home, the Casket not being persecuted by
the Postal Department, so some people
reckon that a local Diamond Keg would be
no bad idea.
One of the rocks that lie in wait for the
Hogan barque in Vic. is the unofficial trade-
union of ex-bobbies, who went out during
the police strike. There are still 300 of them,
and they made a fine show in the last Eight
Hours Day procession. They demand re-
instatement, with all pre- and post-strike
privileges, and Labor leaders, not then being
in office, smiled upon them. Trouble will
now be the portion of the said leaders,
whether they grant the demand or whether
they don’t.
Gibson, 0.8. E., who refused to give a
Parliamentary select committee information
pertinent to the financial side of the film
“industry,” as he and his kind call it, is a
constituent and supporter of the Prime Mini-
ster. Bruce is not the sort of man to let
such considerations influence him, but some
people must have been annoyed when he
transformed the committee into a royal com-
mission, so that the information hiight be
extracted. Others were disappointed that he
didn’t put a couple of good Protectionists
on the commission while he was about it.
Considering that the establishment of a real
film industry is aimed at, or should be, there
are too many Foreign-traders on the job.
A proposition laid before the Tariff Board
in Brisbane was that a bonus of £lO per ton
shall be paid on all copper raised and refined
in Australia while the price of standard cop-
per hangs below £66 per ton. Above that
price the bonus is to taper off, till at £76
it vanishes. The export of unrefined copper
is to be stopped by absence of bonus and by
an export duty of £4 per ton. If standard
copper decided to stay at or around £66 for
an eternity or two, the business might be
very expensive, for the more it succeeded the
more it would cost. In the end Australia
might find itself faced with opprobrium and
dumping duties. It might be better to sub-
sidise the making of woollen goods and
things like that for the local market. The
local market is always with us.
Having enacted that the per capita allow-
ance to the States will cease in the centre
of 1928 the Federal Treasurer has called
a conference of State Treasurers for June
14 to consider what should take its place.
It is stated that “no definite proposals will
be put before the conference by the Federal
Ministry.” If the Federal Ministry is bar-
ren of expedients the easiest course is to
c,n .
sit back and listen to the cat-chorus.
It is all a matter of subsidy, of course;
but the present uncertainty of communica-
tion between Tasmania and the rest of the
Commonwealth makes a couple of oil-driven
ships for the Straits a necessity. The fire-
men cause the hold-ups nine times out cf
ten, and a system that doesn’t suffer if the
fireman does get drunk is the only safe
system.
A quaint item of news is to the effect that
100 Yankees and Yankesses, members of a
“Hands off China” society, paraded with
flags outside the British Embassy at Wash-
ington, as a protest against “British imperial-
ism.” The Yankees and Yankesses mightbe
surprised if there arose in London a “Hands
off Mexico-Niearagua-Panama-Philippines-
Porto Rica-Hawaii” society, and it performed
outside Uncle’s embassy, and called to him
to come out like a man and pay his just
debts, or at least those of his repudiating
States. Possibly he would want boundless
damages for the outrage on his diplomatic
sanctity.
After the Labor Conference-at Canberra
had passed a stern resolution in favor of
freedom of speech and freedom of the press,
the Printing Employees’ Union at Perth
closed up the press, or at least the West
Australian, at short notice. It had been
rumored for some weeks that there would be
no issue for the ducal visit, so the event
wasn’t unexpected.
“Here comes another seedy old acquaint-
ance with a borrowing expression in his eye.”
That must be the remark in London when
the familiar figure of an Australian poli-
tician heaves in sight. McCormack, of
Queensland, heaved in the other day. and
bumped into McKell of N.S.W., who was just
getting ready to come out with three loans,
two Yankee and one British, under his arm.
McC., given the usual perfunctory Parliamen-
tary lunch, said he had come in search of
cheap money “to develop trade and migra-
tion.” If trading, instead of bringing in
wealth, makes the' State so poor that it is
in perpetual need of more loans, it would be
better to leave off trading and save much
expense. The distinguished but penniless
Australian pilgrim whose pants have begun
to go has become a rotten advertisement on
the other side.
The comedy of the Irish “Republic’s” New
York loan had a precedent. Jeff Davis's
Confederacy sent two inefficient envoys to
Europe to raise a loan, and they fell into the
hands of an obliging firm, said to be of
German extraction. It undertook to float the
loan (£3,000,000) payable by instalments,
but not to guarantee it, and it bargained foi
the first instalment as its commission. The
firm’s instalment came in pretty well, but
then a rot set in. and many subscribers re-
solved to cut their original loss and pay no
more. The envoys asked the firm for the
money, and the firm bade them collect it
themselves. In the end the firm did very
well, the bondholders lost all they put in.
and the Confederacy made a ’bus fare or two.
The Labor Conference at Canberra re-
solved on a number of things, one being, of
course, that the 44-hour week should b>-
applied to industry in general all over tin;
Commonwealth, “with shorter hours for
women workers and where health is men-
aced.” In Queensland the Board of Trade
has done some preparatory work with a
view to bringing rural industries under the
44-hour law. And the Federal Court is
periodically taking further steps in the same
direction. The question whether Australia
as a whole can stand unlimited fooling with
its means of support is consistently left
out of the problem.
When the House of Commons reached that
clause in the Trades Unions Bill which pro-
hibits the fining, suspension or expulsion
or boycotting of a union member who re-
fuses to .join in an illegal strike, the excite-
ment of the Opposition grew intense. The
cause of Liberty roared and even poor old
Judas Iscariot was dragged in as an illus-
tration. It was all a matter of the point
of view. The bygone Arkansas planter who
was willing to die in his war harness for
the sacred right of a man to wallop his own
nigger had his point of view likewise, and
who can blame him?
“Clifford Snook”; Much is said and writ-
ten and printed about the mysterious ways of
persons who have the spending of public
money, and who have a craving to get im-
ported wares; to accept the higher or highest
tender; to acquire the expensive bit of land
instead of the cheap one which seems equally
suitable: or to buy something useless and
irrelevant for no visible reason. There is dazed
inquiry as to why it is done, but the doers
never explain. I wonder if it could be laid
down as a legal principle that in every such
case the inquiry shall start with the assump-
tion that the public has been victimised.
Then anyone, having assured himself of the
act. and no satisfactory explanation being
forthcoming (I don’t remember that it ever
is) within a brief period fixed by law, could
state as openly as lie pleased that Cornelius
Blucbody, or whatever his name may be, is an
uncouth crook, and agitate for an examination
of his bank-account, at least. Being no legal
authority, I don’t know how one would lay
down the principle, but it appears no harder
than laying a foundation-stone, and I have
done that.
THE DISILLUSIONED ONES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“At the Dailey election three months ago, Mr.
Lang eulogised Mr. Theodore as a man of outstanding
ability, whom the Labor party could not alford to
lose. Mr. Theodore reciprocated by calling Mr.
Lang the best Premier N.S.W. had ever had. At
Warringah last week, the M.H.R. for Dailey declared
that there were people of overweening pride in the
N.S.AV. Labor movement who would have to be
ruthlessly dealt with. The Premier retorted that
the M.H.R. for Dailey was a new arrival from another
State who had accepted a strong party seat on
a platter, and that nobody was afraid of him, whether
he had the gloves on or oft.”
Time was when each of you to each
Was dearer than a brother,
When to and fro the bouquets flew
And butter —generous issues, too—
You handed one another.
Yet now upon Warringah’s heights
You close in vicious rally
Who, side by side, the foe defied
And, blade to blade, about you laid
In Dailey.
Time was you boomed each other’s stock
With ringing-loud assertion.
Tis sad that such admiring trust
Should change so quick to cold disgust
And passionate aversion.
Is this the cherished idol, Jack,
Now butt for venom’d sally,
By whom you swore? And, Theodore,
Is this the Lang whose praise you sang
In Dailey?
What cynic, misanthropic doubts.
In smarting souls must waken
When flsts that you were wont to grii
In warm and pulsing fellowship
Full in your face are shaken !
With canine snarl and feline swear
You fill tlie Labor alley,
The pair who met —one can’t forget—
To coo your loves like cushat doves
In Dailey.

“11. J.K.”: My neighbor Schultz has
always been proud of his nationality. At
the outbreak of war four of his stalwart

dad, as the result of vigorous denunciations,
became an internee. After the war ceased
and the young men returned there was some
sort of a family reunion : nevertheless Schultz
senior continued to proclaim himself an

enthusiastic .admirer of the Kaiser and all
his works. Consequently, when passing the
Schultz farm one night, I was surprised to
hear an uproarious chorus of “God Save the
King,” with the old German’s basso pro-
fundo distinctly recognisable. I met the
old fellow a few days later and ventured
to congratulate him on his new-found pat-
riotism. “Batriotism pe tamned,” he growled,
“we sing der same tune, put I sings it in

“Simon”: At last I’ve found a second-hand
dealer with a sense of humor. In the win-

wedged in among field-glasses, false teeth
and solid gold-plated watches marked “40/-,”
my eye lit on a paperweight casting with
the head of Billy Hughes on it. It was
satirically ticketed “£25,000” !

“Gooram”: It isn’t only city stores that
are liable to suffer losses when the electric
light fails (B. 12/5/’27). I was in an
A.I.F. camp at Rollestone (Eng.) during the
late war, and one pay-night, when the cash
was being spent and the beer absorbed freely
in the canteen, the camp was suddenly
plunged into Stygian darkness. The “juice”
came on again in a few minutes, but brief
though the interval was it was long enough
for the canteen till, containing a substantial
sum, to have been effectively looted. Sub-
sequent investigations showed that the fail-
ure of the light was no accident; the whole
business had been scientifically planned. A
“zero hour” had been fixed and the raid on
the currency timed to the second. But not
even a court of inquiry could sheet home the
guilt to anyone.

“Narara”: Are the emergency buttons in
the N.S.W. trains of any use? I recently
travelled from Newcastle to Sydney in a
carriage with some mildly skylarking boys ;
near Morisset one of them accidentally broke
the glass over the emergency button and
pressed the alleged signal. The whole pack
were badly scared when they realised what
had been done and began to concoct a plau-
sible tale to account for the accident. But
when the train didn’t slow down and no
official came along to demand explanations,
they decided the whole thing must be a
fraud. To test this theory one audacious
youth pressed the button designedly, and
even held it down for some minutes with the
heel of a boot, but nothing happened. Men-
tioning this to a friend a little later, he told
me he had seen the button pressed when a
man fell off a train quite recently, but the
signal was either unheard or disregarded.
Seeing that these signals may be the means
of saving life or preventing a serious acci-
dent, surely more care should be taken to
keep them in order.

the other day that
the mission had
“established filling

derness to recharge
the exhausted spirit
of pioneers.” In
cold truth, the mis-
sionary, and the
L.M.S. variety in
particular, has no
time at all for the
pioneer, be he ex-
plorer, trader or
prospector. T h e
last two classes, in
particular, ha v e
always been coldly
regarded by the
shepherds, for,
however praise-
worthy their atti-
tude may be to-
wards the native
flock, they tend to
draw the convert
away from the fold,
and, incidentally,
teach him to de-
mand wages, in-
stead of being con-
tent with that in-
ward glow of satis-
faction for a good
deed done which is
often the only re-
ward for services
rendered to the
church. A long-ago

who was much in

sion ideals in this
respect, once said
in the writer’s

puan gold warden,
that he wished to

“ J.E.” : The story of the “Clark Millions”
lias been published all over again in the
S. M. Herald. It is a funny tale as the
paper tells it. It seems that Senator Wil-
liam Andrews Clark died in 1925, leaving
neither widow nor children nor any relations
in America. He was a school-teacher and
then a Confederate officer, and after the
Civil War he went to Montana, where he
made a fortune estimated as high as
£101,000.000. Already (since, the year be-
fore last) 62 sets of claimants from all parts
of the world have had a try for the fortune,
but the U.S. law, which is evidently an
express greyhound, has turned them all
down. Now 17 claimants from N.S.W., the
REFLECTIONS.
CHEERY ONE (to sad little man at the wedding): “Cheer up. You’re putting a damper
on the whole show. Why don’t you join in the fun?”
SAD LITTLE M AN: “Oh, I’m all right.”
CHEERY O NE: “Well, hitch up. Have you hissed the bride?”
SAD LITTLE MAN: “No —not lately.”
home of claimants, are to get busy. Three
Newcastle citizens are said to have put up
£20,000 for legal expenses (in Montana),
and in return they are to get £750,000 when
the fortune is collected. As the claimants
expect £3,500,000 each this trifle won’t be
missed. “Who’s Who” for 1927 reports
ex-Senator William Andrews Clark as a man
who was married twice and had two sons
and four daughters. Probably he has, or
had, plenty of grandchildren and relations-
in-law as well. About his wealth and his
Montana record there is no doubt, and he
was certainly a school-teacher; but as lie
was a Northerner who went to Colorada in
1862 his career as a Confederate soldier
seems impossible. A great deal of trouble
arises through the habit of assuming that
when millionaire Brown dies in Oklahoma
or Ashantee (or even if lie has no money,
and remains alive, and his name is really
Smith) that he must have left neither heirs,
heiresses nor will, and that the Joneses of
Australia must have an indubitable right to
the entire fortune, partly because of the
similarity of the name and partly because
they live in Australia, which is evidence in
itself. Arthur Orton, butcher, of Wagga,
who imagined himself Roger Tichborne, was
possibly the man who sowed the seeds of
the Missing Heir in this country, and he
has grown to gigantic proportions.

“Wang”: Re street nomenclature (B.
5/5/’27). In one part of Caulfield (Vic.)
there is a network of thoroughfares that
must have been christened by an enthusias-
tic forester. They include Sycamore, Alder,
Poplar, Cedar, Larch, Olive, Almond, Fil-
bert. Teak, Beech, Birch, Maple and Myrtle.
A stone’s-tlirow away somebody interested in
astronomy presumably must have had a
turn, with the result that we have Jupiter,
Mars, Venus, Saturn and Mercury streets.
Close handy a former Anglican bishop of
Melbourne has cut his name deep on the
map in three streets named respectively
Field, Flowers and Goe. And at St. Kilda
one can almost visualise the charge of the
Light Brigade when he gets into a swirl of
such highways as Alma, Balaclava, Crimea

“Naklioda”: The namings of suburban
streets aren’t always as irrelevant as some
of the pedants think. Just off the Burwood-
road, running easterly out of Melbourne, is
Isabella-grove. The lady commemorated was
wife of old George Coppin, and Coppin’s-
grove lies fittingly alongside it, while the
adjoining Sliakspeare-grove recalls one side
of the ancient mummer’s long activities. Cop-
pin bought the estate thus subdivided from
James Palmer, whose memory survives in the
name of the neighboring St. James Park.
James was not a saint bnt a knight, and first
President of the Legislative Council, and
shield-shaped tiles roof his picturesque
lodge at the top of Coppin’s-grove, while
further down is his feudal castle (now
occupied by William Macpherson), which
is still topped by a curfew bell. The
bell fetched the convicts who farmed the
fat Yarra flats in to their evening meal and
their slumber on the big slabs of red-gum to
which they were chained during the night—-
the rings and staples still persist. These
are some of the matters memorised by the
names in Coppin’s-grove, and they seem to
me at least as fitting as Wonk-wonk (mean-
ing water) and Bungarungarungaroo (mean-
ing nine dead goannas on a rock).

“Glaucus”: The job of excavating Her-
culaneum, the city which was buried by
Vesuvius, at the same time as the better-
known Pompeii, 1848 years ago, should
interest the tourist agencies quite as much as
the archaeologists. Indeed, it is probable
that the former ivere what the astute Mus-
solini had in mind when lie decided to dig
out a new objective for Cook’s trippers.
No goldmine ever floated has paid dividends
compared with those returned by Pompeii. Her-
culaneum has been left alone until now,
largely because tradition said it was over-
come by a lava torrent, whereas Pompeii was
snowed in by gently drifting ashes. Boring,
however, has shown that mud and gravel,
and not solidified lava, cover the town. Pom-
peii has given an idea of what the sister
city may yield up in the matter of art and
ethnological treasures.

“The Listening Insect” : In imitation of a
futile English experiment half a dozen devo-
tees are going to sit in a closed room at
3LO in Melbourne opposite a microphone
and think of things, and listeners all over
Australia will be given three weeks in which
to report what the thinkers thought. The
idea is to prove the reality of telepathic
communication, but most electrical engi-
neers, without being in the least sceptical
about telepathy in general, will be apt to
regard it as foolishness. If the waves set
up by the brain can agitate a thermionic
valve, why not sit down and think at a
telephone, instead of shouting to overcome
the noises of induction? Or why not avoid
paying for one’s telegrams by going down
to the landing-places and thinking at the
submarine cables? Henri Fabre conducted
experiments which showed that certain moths
could detect the presence of their females
from miles up the wind, although the females
were imprisoned in a house. If that was a
form of telepathy it needed no assistance
from radio, which wasn’t then invented.
THE SAILOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ilis hair was long; liis nose was red —-
’Twixt icy blast and tropic sun.
Strange if it hadn’t been, he said —
The life was hard, but it was fun,
And more exciting than on shore;
Well, yes, he didn’t mind one more.
He’d sailed all oceans in his time,
And travelled well-nigh everywhere;
He spoke of shipwreck, tempest, crime,
Of whaling trips, and islands fair,
Pausing to drain with gusto tense
Another pot at my expense.
He spoke of days ere steam was king,
When famous clippers ploughed the seas ;
He sighed as one remembering
The Cutty Sark and boats like these.
A final parting glass I bid
Him have with me. The which he did.
He rolled away from out the bar,
I turned to Bung, serene and grim,
And asked who was the jolly tar.
He merely sniffed and said, “What, ’im?
Works in the grain-store by the quay—
'E ’asn’t never been ter sea.”

"Stellsby”: Melbourne hasn’t experienced
what one might call a decent electrical storm
for two years or more, that is to say since
it began to equip itself with wireless on a
grand scale. Before that the southern capi-
tal periodically got its whack of lightning
and thunder. It makes one wonder whether
wireless counters electrical disturbances in
the heavens, for the phenomenon is not con-
fined to Melbourne by any means; a similar
state of affairs has been noted in other
parts of Australia.
“Sea Nomad”; Many people
dare not ascend to a -groat height
because of the overmastering
urge to jump off that they know
will come upon them. I once
had to fight the same impulse
in different bui p “haps parallel
conditions. AH* of men, on
hands and knees, were chipping
the rust-eaten deck of a dis-
mantled gunboat in a northern
port through which the tides
rush at the rate of six miles
an hour. The day was overcast
and squally, with a strong sou’-
east breeze. The gunboat was
pitching heavily, the choppy
waves occasionally spraying the
deck. There was no railing,
and the deck where we worked
was barely two feet above water.
My right eye being nearest the
water was continually subcon-
scious of the huge torrents
capped with frothy foam and
hissing bubbles that went
whirling past. Again and again
I found myself working towards
the extreme edge of the un-
guarded deck, and checked my-
self with a shudder. Had a man
fallen over he would have been
gone like a chip, and yet the
fascination persisted. At knock-
off time one of the men con-
fided to me that lie had put in
a hell of a day: it took all his
will power a dozen times to hold
him from lurching head first
into the racing water.

“Final” : Washing-day on a
station, the big, bricked-in
copper bubbling full-tilt over a
good brigalow log, with the
missus serenely ignorant, that
brigalow is not conducive to
prolong the life of the copper.
The laundress, old, weather-
beaten and gnarled with toil,
and the mother of a numerous
family, mostly grown stockmen
now, pauses with a wet sheet
twisted round her arm, as the
mailman slows down his sulky
near by and communicates the
latest bit of local news. “Mick
Donovan dead, yer say, over at
Rocky Gully, and the pore feller
ler be buried this afternoon?”
Five minutes later she had put
the clothes on to soak in a tub
of clean water, rolled up her bag
apron, and was searching for
her hat, preparatory to walking
the seven miles to Rocky Gully.
“Tell the missus I’ll be back
termorrer,” she commissioned us
—“l’m goin’ ter the funeral. I
always liked ole Mick. Besides,
he wus the father of my Willie.”

“The Listening Insect” : Vic-
toria, alas! has forfetited the
reputation for piety it made for
itself last year, when it placed
religious services at the head of
its preferences in broadcasting.
This year’s plebiscite, taken by
the Argus, although not quite
completed, places band music
first, wrestling descriptions
second and religious services
thirty-second on the list. The descriptions
of wrestling were only recently introduced.
They come mysteriously over the ether, like
the words of some unimpassioned god re-
cording a murder of a riot on a planet not
under his jurisdiction. A distant but blood-
thirsty uproar like a million mastiffs worry-
ing a spaniel to death accompanies the talk.
It is the voice of the 12,000 fortunate spec-
tators of the show. The account is couched
in esoteric language which not one in 10
of the listeners fully understands, but it is
enormously suggestive. When the announcer,
in his impassive tones, reports that Bill has
a reverse double wristlock on his friend who
is prising him off with a foot under the chin,
he might be a Spanish inquisitor describing
a new experiment in torture. Sadism —per-
haps Stadiumism would be a better word
is an ancient ingredient of human nature,
and it is wonderful how it keeps cropping
up in a world of aeroplanes and Fords and
wireless.

“Amyl Nitrite” : Why does a person of
low intellect register an abnormal tempera-
ture on a bed of sickness whereas in similar
circumstances a person whose intelligence is
of a reasonably high order almost always
registers a comparatively low temperature?
I have noticed that this is the case especi-
ally among T.B.’s. Incidentally, in a hospi-
tal medical ward or a sanatorium, an illiter-
ate person—usually a “windy” patient—will
greet another of similar mental calibre, morn-
ing and evening, with the inevitable question:
"’Ow’s your temp.?” whereas among patients
of normal intelligence “temps” are seldom
discussed. By the way, dyed-in-the-w T ool T.B.
specialists are agreed that the respiratory
and pulse condition rather than his tempera-
ture is the true index of a patient’s condi-
tion.

"Sebrof”: There is a house in Hobart
with the whole exterior covered with pearl-
oyster shells, stuck face outwards in plaster.
The owner, a lady, once found a valuable
pearl in a blister, and with the proceeds
built this house. The shells are there to
keep green the memory of the source of her
fortune, and, especially on a sunny day, there
is no chance of the neighbors forgetting it.

Robert Williams, from Kurri Kurd
(N.S.W.) :
Charles Pritchard tells of the wreck of the Walter
Hood on the N.S.W. coast in April, 1870 (B.
5/5/’27). Will you allow me, another survivor and
formerly a seaman on the ill-fated ship, to correct
my old shipmate (whom I am pleased to locate after
57 years) about a few details? The ship was
wrecked on a Monday night; Tuesday morning found
31 of us huddled together on the stern, with the
captain in what remained of his cabin. A seaman
and a passenger were the first to attempt to swim
ashore. Both were drowned and the captain was
washed out of his demolished cabin to meet the
same fate. Then two more seamen perished trying
THE LABOR CHOIR.
“Two Labor candidates were run for Warringali, one supported by Mr. Charlton and the Conroy faction,
the other by Mr. Lang and the. Seale faction.”
to swim ashore, and the boatswain followed them to
his doom on the Wednesday. On Thursday, I myself
(whom the newspaper termed a West Indian black)
and Charles Branson, an American colored man,
attempted the trip. He had the only lifebelt on
the wreck and also a line, but he got into difficulties
and was drowned while being pulled back to the
ship. After being- carried some distance out to sea,
I managed to make the shore. Charles Pritchard
came next, and I swam out and helped him in. We
found a lifebuoy and attached a line to it, Charles
remaining on shore with the line, while I swam
out with the lifebuoy and helped in five others,
including the first and second mates. On Friday,
two passengers, the Smith brothers, and another sea-
man were rescued in the same way. We found and
buried six bodies, not nine, including the captain’s.
The steamer that took the 13 survivors from the wreck
was not the Thetis, but the Illawong.
“L.C.M.”: The recent discussion on the
qualities of different poisons is recalled by a
cable from Paris that a woman has been
convicted and sentenced to 10 years’ impri-
sonment for attempting to poison her hus-
band with small doses of arsenic in his
morning coffee. The result would be a sub-
acute gastro-enteritis, with neuritis and
other complications, symptoms quite liable
to puzzle unsuspecting physicians. Hence
the popularity of arsenic among would-
be husband-poisoners and wife-poison-
ers ; its very gradual onset makes it
quite likely that foul play will not be sus-
pected. Some years ago the case of a man
in a large public hospital in Australia baf-
fled all the leading physicians, until a raw
graduate—a woman, by the way-—directed
suspicion to the dainties which the patient’s
wife brought to his bedside twice a week.
These were examined and found to contain
arsenic. The lady was tried, but there was
a sufficient flaw in an otherwise complete
chain of evidence to secure her acquittal.
But I wouldn’t recommend arsenic nowa-
days ; doctors are too wary.

“Adamascus” : One of Queensland’s early-
day bushrangers was known as “The Wild
Scotchman,” his real name being McPherson.
There was nothing of the Ned Kelly type
about him, but he was of a wild, roving dis-
position ; lie wandered the country terroris-
ing people until captured by the strategy of
a mailman. After he had served some years
of a stiff sentence a Brisbane clergyman
named Patterson became interested in him,
and secured his release on a bond. The
Wild Scotchman was very grateful to the
minister, and later made him a beautifully-
carved writing-desk. Curiously, a daughter
of Patterson married the mailman who had
captured McPherson, and to-day the desk
is in the possession of a grandson of the
mailman who put McPherson in gaol.

“Anophele”: How’s this for second sight—-
the real article, not the metaphorical?
Fifteen years ago C. J. Scrutton, of Borro-
loola, probably the oldest man in North
Australia—he is close on 90 —was unable
to read without the aid of glasses. A few
weeks back I was astounded to see the old
chap pick up a copy of The Bulletin and
read out a paragraph without the slightest
difficulty. To my amazed inquiry he in-
formed me that several years ago whilst on
one of his long trips he had lost his reading-
glasses and was forced to do without them.
At first he found a little difficulty, but the
sight continued to improve to such an extent
that he had almost forgotten he ever wore
glasses. Has anyone ever heard of a similar
case?

“Cuchulain”: Several people risked pto-
maine poisoning recently at Cam'perdown
(Vic.) when some tins of rabbit were un-
earthed at an old factory which went out
of business 35 years ago. The stuff, how-
. ever, proved to be as wholesome and satis-
fying as if it had been canned last week
instead of last century.

“Chancery Lane”: The site of the syna-
gogue in Bourke-street, Melbourne, recently
offered at auction, was obtained by the
Jewish community at the first land sale in
Melbourne, in 1837, and has never changed
hands since. In the contract of sale at the
recent auction it was stipulated that when
the building was pulled down the records
under the foundation stone should belong
to the trustees of the Melbourne Hebrew
congregation, and that the ark and memorial
tablets should also remain their property.
“N. or M.” : Curious place-names? “Dub-
bilbarril,” near Strahan, on the west coast
of Tassy, looks like a native word, but i>
really the point where the river forks.
“Flowerpot” and “Sandfly” are two other
Tasmanian names, the former christened
after a curiously-shaped rock. “Sheepwash,"
on Tassy’s satellite, Bruny Island, comme-
morates one of the activities of the early-
day farmers.
“Ivai te Kuri”: Speaking of immunity
to the effects of poison gas (B. 21/4/’27),
the 2nd N.Z.E. had a bull-terrier, souven-
ired from a Fritz dug-out in Delleville Wood
in 1916, that could sniff the thickest of phos-
gene gas without turning a hair. I had him
under my arm in a shell-hole near Hooge
when gas-shells were landing all round for
quite an hour, and he showed no ill effects
whatever.
“Cousin J.”; The story of the trustful
Melburnian who posted a telegram in a
street letter-box and left the money on the
roof of the receptacle (B. 21,/4/’27) reminds
me of a visit I once paid to Moonta (S.A.t.
Late in the evening my hostess asked ine to
lend her a stamp. Upon my regretting that
I hadn’t one she said, “Never mind, I’ll just
pin a note to the letter and drop the money
in the box.”
“Seebee” : Death has removed
a lady who for eight years
haunted Vic. State public offices
with a personal grievance
against Ministers. She was Miss
F. Weeks, and her claim was a
legacy from her dad, a con-
tractor, who considered he had
been treated unfairly by the
Railway Department. Snowball,
the member for Brighton, man-
aged to get a select committee of
the Legislative Assembly
appointed, and it recommended
the payment of £lOOO to the
aggrieved contractor. Watt, who
was Treasurer at the time,
undertook to find the money and
pay it out in periodical allow-
ances. Weeks died before the
debt was liquidated, and his
daughter took up the running.
At first she was granted £1 a
week compassionate allowance
for herself and a similar amount
for her aged mother, but when
the economical McPhairson
arrived at the Treasury he re-
duced the dole to £l. It be-
came an obsession with the
beneficiary to have that quid a
week restored, and for years she-
waylaid heads of Governments
and Ministers, including Law-
son, McPhairson, Peacock and
Prendergast. Peacock had the
worst time of it, as lie was this
man who had first granted the
£2 a week. The mother, who is
91, will be made comfortable for
the rest of her days in the Bene-
volent Asylum at Cheltenham.

“Starboard Hand”: Aus-
tralian battleships have occasion-
ally carried a woman passenger,
too (B. 19/5/’27). In January,
1919, 11.M.A.5. Brisbane gave
Lady Smith-Dorrien a passage
from Gibraltar to Plymouth;
special permission having been
accorded by the Admiralty.
More recently a vice-regal party,
including -women, returned to
Sydney from a tour of the
Pacific Islands in IT.M.A.S.
Sydney.
“C.Q.”: A by-law about the
keeping of guinea-pigs on private
premises has been added to the
civic statutes of Brighton
(Vic.) ; and so ends one of the
longest struggles in suburban
history. It is over two years
ago since an Englishman made
himself allegedly objectionable
to his neighbors by starting a
guinea-pig farm in that expen-
sive district. The demand for
the rodent is continuous and
large. The Federal serum farm
at Royal Park absorbs scores of
them weekly, the University
takes move, and there are other
research laboratories which re-
quire a constant supply of these
martyrs to science. So the
Englishman is doing a good
deed, but his neighbors would
rather he should do it further
off. The council gets over the
difficulty neatly. It prescribes
that guinea-pigs shall not he kept within 100
feet of any dwelling, and Brighton is packed
pretty close.
“Carisbrook, .Tun.”: “Showy” was the
worstj shot in the battalion, and no amount
of practice improved him in the slightest
degree. His bullets threatened his trench-
mates more than they did the enemy’s front
line, and at length the lieutenant became
exasperated. “For God’s sake, man, go and
shoot yourself!” he said. “Yessir." replied
“Snow” ; and he clicked his heels and walked
off. Presently the n.c.o. was horrified to
hear a rifle go off round the corner. He
rushed to the spot, expecting to find “Snow
extinct. “Missed again, sir!” reported that
warrior with a solemn phiz.

“King Bolt”: “Country Ped” was per-
fectly right when he wrote (R.P. 5/5/27 >
that “sorrow and tragedy reach deeper into
the fibres of our being than joy or laughter.
The other afternoon, watching an old mate
searching for a piece of pine to finish a
small job he was doing. I asked why he
didn’t break up an old butter-box lying m
a corner of his workshop. “No,” he saw-
“l couldn’t break that up. I sat on tluu
box and read tl.« letter from the army cliap;
lain who laid my son to rest in France.
And only the other day I asked a little gu
of our neighborhood her name. When sue
lisped “.Teancourt,” I remembered an uncle or
hers was killed there.
PROGRESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tn the broad days or the little.
In a large world or a small,
The knives of the grey years whittle
Down the great and tall.
Till little is lett of Caesar
And less of his old Rome;
And the waves of each shrill breeze are
Bubbles of spent foam.
The temple columns are broken,
Gods in their fables drown :
And a wisp of words spoken
Must stand for an old renown.
Vet I wonder if all the glory
Of the years died well
To fashion the simple story
One child’s eyes tell.

“Dum Spiro”: The mild autumn sun
streamed through the windows of Sydney’s
District Court, and the old usher, sitting in
the pleasant warmth, began to feel its
soporific influence. With his nodding the
spectators sot careless, and there was a hum
of talk. S'Onali, noticing the usher dozing,
sharply rapped out a “Keep order there!’’
The old man, suddenly recalled to conscious-
ness, got to his feet, hand to mouth, went
down the court into the passage calling:
“Keith Order —Keith Order—Keith

.Tack Point': He was gazing beerily into
the window of the tobacconist’s shop, and
it was obvious that something amused him.
I pulled.up, and he invited me to share the
joke, pointing to a conspicuously displayed
notice, which read: “We sold First Prize
in No. .158 Golden Casket.” I professed
my inability to see anything amusing in the
announcement, as did Mr. Capstan, who at
that moment emerged from the doorway to
see what all the hilarity was abouk “Struth,”
said the beery one, addressing the latter,
“you’re a real clever sort of cove, you are.
Hold the ( hie.) first prize in the Casket. Why

“Uramao”: A burglar who settled down
comfortably in the scene of his burgling is
reported from Dunedin. The police, it seems,
were on his trail when he broke into a
wholesale store and took up his temporary
quarters in a loft above the top floor. He
dragged up a ladder after him and during
the absence of the staff used it to get down
and help himself to champagne, spirits, beer,
wine, tinned cheese, pineapples, sheep
tongues, sardines and cigarettes. For a
severe cold contracted up near the chilly
roof he dosed himself so liberally with a
lung cure that a threatened cough was driven
away, and the men working daily within a
few feet of him were quite ignorant of his
presence. He had been there four weeks
when his lair was discovered.

“G.8.L.” : Somebody who was classing the
contents of an Ultimo (Sydney) bottle-
yard eight years ago had his attention
arrested by a dead marine with several
names engraved on it. Thinking it might
have some value as
a curio, lie handed
the bottle to G. JL
Bressington, of the
N. S. Wales Bottle
Co. ; the latter put
it away somewhere
in his home, and.
only quite recently,
with the aid of
some expert advice,
elucidated its his-
tory. It seems that
in 1912 Frank
Wild and the mem-
bers of his Ant-
arctic expedition
celebrated Midwin-
ter Day by a din-
ner at Shackleton’s
Glacier. The wine
used had been pre-
sented by a friend
in London, and
Wild suggested
that those present
should engrave
their names with a
diamond on a Ma-
deira bottle. One
of them (C. T.
Harrison) also
drew a representa-
tion of the Aurora,
their vessel, on the
other side of the
bottle. This sou-
venir was in due
course sent to Lon-
don, where it
doubtless is reli-
giously preserved by
some collector. A
second bottle was
inscribed with the
same set of nanus,
though without the
picture of the ship ;
this one somehow
disappeared until it
was resurrected in
the Ultimo bottle-
yard. The names
T , . „ T .,, engraved on it are:
I rank Wild, A. L. Kennedy, G. Evan .Tones,
( . Hoadley, Charles T. Harrison, George
Dovers, A. D. Watson and Morton it. Moyes.

“Bab" : The latest story about the illegi-
bility of doctors' handwriting comes from
a tovvn in western N.S.W. One of the local
physicians dispensed with the services of his
chauffeur and gave him a reference on leav-
ing. The recipient, after ruefully scanning
the crabbed hieroglyphics, made a bet that
if the document were sent to the local chem-
ist it would be taken for a prescription.
He won ; Squills duly made up the medicine
and labelled it: “A tablespoonful every four
hours.’’
“Coo-ee” : If the Yorks are both fond of
reading (B. 19/5/’27) they should have
plenty to occupy them on the voyage home.
When they were in Melbourne the Aus-
tralian Literature Society presented the
royal pair with 50 volumes by local writers.
The list includes 12 novels, 20 books of
poetry and some standard works on the his-
tory of the Commonwealth and all that
therein is. Finally there were some chil-
dren’s books which, the society expressed a.
hope, “might later on give the Princess
Elizabeth an interest in Australian fauna
and flora.”

“Lao-dah”: Vic. Education Department
regularly issues per medium of the School
Paper lists of words which to the teachers
are as the Laws of the Medes and Persians.
One such list recently contained the word
“tumultous.” Approximately 100,000 school-
children accented this ruling as final, but
one or two individualists preferred the ver-
sion of the dictionaries. These rebels were
punished by detentions and being made to
write “tumultous” many times. But the
martyrs had parents to stick up for them.
Attacked on all sides, Mr. Tate’s advisers
regretfully confessed that it was a printer's
error.

“Kai te Ivuri”: Speaking of mustard-gas
(B. 21/4/’27). One property of the atroci-
ous stuff used by Fritz was that in very cold
or frosty weather, especially at night, it
would settle on the ground like dew. After
it. had frozen or liquefied, the first warm
wind or the rising sun would lift it into
renewed activity, making- it just as bad to
breathe as when the shell exploded. Before
we_ got wise to this peculiarity, a M.B.
Brigade li.q. crowd had bivvied in the Butte,
past Chateaux Wood, on the Ypres sector.
One frosty night Fritz shelled the position
with mustard-gas. All gas curtains, etc..
were let down, and no casualties were re-
ported at the time. The gas soon drifted
away or settled on the ground, and later in
the night the occupants of the bivvies and
dug-outs hooked up the curtains (generally
blankets soaked in solution) and propped
open the doors to get fresh air, preparatory
to returning to bunk. About 3 a.m. the
wind changed to a warmer quarter and there
was a thaw; the gas lifted and drifted into
the bivvies. Nearly every occupant of the
Butte that night was a casualty in the
morning.

“Patiti”: Speaking of quaint bush hotels.
I struck a house of call in a lonely part
of Vic. the other day, and asked for soda-
water, only to be told that no “cordials” of
any kind were stocked. I suggested that this
might bear hardly on local bushmen suffer-
ing a recovery, but a wdiiskered Bung merely
remarked dourly: “They suffer no recoveries
here.” After getting down two fingers of
his schnapps I came to the conclusion that
lie probably spoke the truth. It occurred
to me, though I didn’t say so, that an over-
dose of this stuff would be more likely to
make a man crawl away into the bush" and
die.
THE UNKNOWN ROGER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“One of the vilest and most noxious of the weeds
that follow wheat cultivation in Australia, is known
as Stinking Roger. Its perfume has a distinct
suggestion of unwashed humanity, though why the
name of Roger should have been picked out for
this obloquy it is hard to say.”— A. J. Ewart ,
1 rofessor of Botany in Melbourne Uni.
There’s many an illustrious man lias worn it
for prenomen,
The word that now is fastened on a weed of
evil omen.
Why isn’t there a penal law—there ought to
be, I wis—
-1 rotecting honored, honest names from such
base use as this?
There's many a Roger’s record cut in British
annals deep,
Statesmen and princes of the Church in
storied tombs they sleep;
But none of all the lordly throng whose
light no years can dim'
Has ever had a decent flower christened
after him.
To Roger Bacon what we owe each school-
boy knows, I guess,
And eke what Roger Ascham did for glori-
ous. Queen Bess.
In science tis indelible, in chivalry ’tis
scrolled,
That sturdy-sounding moniker, so Saxon and
so old.
What character does one recall with such
a keen delight
As Addison’s immortal and inimitable knight.
The squire whose name with all that English-
men admire we link,
Of goodness the quintessence and of courtesy
the pink.
Those famous Rogers lived and died. Also
the baronet
Fpon whose title and estate a Wagga butcher
set
His longing eyes. In history their various
names are Avrit,
Quite celebrated, some of them, and one or
two were It.
CONVALESCENT.
“Hullo, Brown! Quite recovered from your operation?'
“Almost: Tec only got twelve pounds more to pay."
And yet there’s one whose infamy may well
outlast their fame;
As long as wheat is grown he’ll be a syno-
nym for shame.
That unknown and (presumably) unwashed,
unfragrant codger
Whose drab identity supplied the noun for
Stinking Roger.
N.S.W.

THEM WAR THE DAYS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tlie dull routine of life goes on, the dreary
days drag past,
And to our weary eyes each seems more
futile than the last.
But none the less we’ll have a different tale
to tell. I’ll swear,
When wliat are now the days that are become
the days that were.
How grandly will they tower above the years
_ of later growth !
We’ll point to them with pride and say,
“Them was the days, my oath !
Them was the days, too right they was.
when’’ —hut you’ve heard it all.
We .never rate them right until they’re gone
beyond recall.
But sadly still the days creep by; poor
things, they cannot see
The aureole of glory they will wear in years
to he!

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Anthony Hordern and Sons, Ltd. —The
disclosed profit supports the prospectus, with
something to spare. The flotation took place
12 months ago, the whole of the issued capital
being* subscribed before the public was let into
Only £2,000,000 of the authorised
->,000,000 was issued—£7so,ooo in 74 pc.
cum. prefs. and £1,250,000 in ordinaries, all
in £1 shares. The purchase money paid to
the old co. was £2,900,000; £1,900,000 in
cash and £1,000,000 in 7 p.c. debentures
haying a currency of 20 years, subject to the
co. s right after 30 years to pay off the whole
or any part of the amount. The debentures
are a first charge on the co.’s undertaking
and assets, and are secured by the usual
trust deeds and mortgages over the co.’s
freeholds. Previous profits were certified as
under:—
Year ended August, 1923 . . . , £236,158
Year ended August, 1924 . . . . 249,682
Year ended August, 1925 . . . . 235*383
Half-year ended February, 1926 . . 124,947
an annual average of £241,763. For the 12
months to February 23 net profit, after pro-
viding for all trading and administrative
exes., depreciation, contingencies, etc.,
amounted to £262,922. This has been dis-
tributed as follows: Interest to vendors to
date of final settlement, £42,602; interest on
debentures, £70,000: formation exes, written
off £20.598; pref. divs., £39,220; 8 p.c. on
ordinaries, £69,589 ; to reserve fund, £20,000 •
carried forward, £913.
Balance-sheet figures afford little oppor-
tunity for other concerns to indulge in com-
parisons, but this Column frowns on the
mixture of goodwill with the fixed assets,
and wants to see the book debts given a
speaking part instead of being merely one
of a crowd. Still, a comparison of a kind can
be made with the figures of the previous
year (quoted in the prospectus) :

Last year’s figures gain by the comparison.
Lite solid -reduction in stocks is particularly
good. It is plain that not only did the
management shift the heavy load of goods
purchased from Lassetter’s. but cleared up
much of its own. The Sydney properties
are shown at 1920 valuations less what was
considered adequate depreciation, and the
London property at a valuation made in
1912. Subsequent purchases and additions
were, taken at cost less depreciation. As
additions and improvements over that period
have been extensive—the co.’s practice was
to write off even valuable improvements—and
as the increment in Sydney city property has
been relatively enormous over’the past seven
years, there is a substantial reserve in the
property item alone.
The new co. took over in June. It is not
to be expected that the remarkable business
built up by the Horderns over the past cen-
tury—the firm is welded into Australian
history—will make sudden and amazing
dashes forward. The Hordern tradition
>s likely to be developed rather than revo-
lutionised under the present board. Already
changes are reported which have brought
improvement, and the public interest in the
co.—the two million shares are well spread—
has won new friends and new business,
(’lose attention is being paid to buying, over-
head is under keen scrutiny, and. although
the co. carries whole departments of slow-
moving lines, there lias been a speeding-up
of turnover wherever possibß These are the
tests of management, and the leading retail
cos. in Sydney have set such a pace that
only the keenest will win through. Lassetter’s
fell out of the race. Although that co. at
one stage of its career had a very sub-
stantial trade and a solid goodwill, it was
unable to keep up with developments and it
was jostled to the rear.
There has been big trading in the shares
throughout the year, most of the selling being
the activities of profit-takers. Now that the
co. has paid its first div., sellers will be
less plentiful. The stock may be considered
as an 8 p.c. proposition, for the board,
headed by Mark Sheldon, is not likely to
have made the initial distribution at that
rate had it not been reasonably sure that,
it could be maintained. The shares should
be a good hold.

Speculation as to whether the Bank of Adel-
aide would go the way of the Royal and
the Victoria, and be swallowed by one of
the bigger banks, enlivened the market for
several weeks. Rumor was very definite, as
usual, the names of the absorbing institu-
tions being freely mentioned. Under the
impetus of the reports the £5-paid shares
lifted to £9 17s. (id., but denials finally
assured the market that there was nothing
doing that way. Although there was then the
inevitable fall in price the market has since
recovered and buyers find no answers to
offers of £9 12s. fid. At the annual meeting
it was made clear that the objection to the
banks losing its identity was very strong.
On the other hand, recent events have shown
that when the price is sufficiently tempting
that objection loses its strength. A word
or two has been also said regarding the
bank s practice of issuing new shares at a
premium, some holders taking the stand
that, inasmuch as the bank pays only 10
p.c., new issues should be at par. Since
the close of accounts the board has announced
a further increase of 50,000 £5 shares,
but nothing has yet been said as to the
terms of issue. The October issue (25 000
shares) increased capital to one million and
reserves to £850,000, which the undistributed
1 . and L. balance raises to £881,827.

Advances were £633,593 greater than at the
previous balance. This was due chiefly to
tlie excess of imports and the fact that a
large quantity of wheat is held in anticipa-
tion of better prices. The liquid position of
course suffered, 47.5 p.c. of the bank’s out-
side liabilities being fluid compared with
54.5 p.c. at the previous balance. The per-
centage is still solid, and it needs to be.
south Australia has had a remarkably fine
run for years: it has enjoyed 12 good seasons
in succession, and there must be a lean year
or two hovering over the skyline. The
bank’s capaWe management has doubtless
taken fullest advantage of the good times to
provide for the setbacks which come at
irregular intervals to every country that so
largely depends on primary production. Bank
premises went up by £64,000-odd. due chiefly
to the purchase of premises in Brisbane
which are being altered to house a new
branch, and extensive alterations have also
been made to the Sydney home. The expan-
sion in the Eastern States will help to

This subsidiary of Marcus Clark moves along
satisfactorily. As in previous years, the
parent, which holds all the ordinaries, paid
itself 71 p.e., although it has the right, now
that formal reserves are in excess of £40,000,
to increase the div. rate. Goodwill is in
at £60,000, but is not counted an asset in
the introductory table. The co. intends to
purchase a property adjoining the present
premises; a deposit has been paid. The

which there are 80,000. This comparison

Results were very satisfactory. From the
expanding business consistently good profits
are being won. Shareholders received their
fifth consecutive 15 p.e., with the offer of
two shares for each three held, at a premium
of 15s. each. At that solid price a fat
portion of the issue will eome on to the
market, and already large numbers of the
rights have changed hands at 7s. to 6s. 6d.
At the latter price the return to investors
on the basis of 15 p.e. divs. is £7 4s. p.e.
Despite the heavy premium the issue is a
nice sweetener to the fine divs. which share-
holders have received. The profit, was struck
after the usual provisions had been made,
and almost £BOOO was visibly added to re-
serves. The management has widened the
co.’s field to good effect and still more is
meditated. Existing warehouses at Albury
are now being enlarged to meet the require-
ments of that district. The total sum raised
from the new issue has to earn a trifle more
than 81 p.e. to pay its way at the rate of
15 p.e., and 8 p.e. on visible funds will
maintain the present distribution when the
whole of the new money is in. Raid capital
will be lifted by the new issue to a quarter-
million. and reserves to £222,337.

The figure for the past year is really better
than it looks, because the sales for 1926
included a heavy carryover (17,400 bales)
from the previous year. Gross earnings in-
creased by £5153 to £113,214. Expenditure
was kept within bounds and £2819 was taken
for depreciation on plant and furniture.

Liabilities were heavier than usual; the new
money will improve the proportion. At
March 31 all outside debt was well covered
by more or less liquid assets. The dry spell
in Victoria has broken and prospects at the
moment look bright for further prosperity
in the pastoral industry in that State, so
that the 15 p.e. div. does not appear to
be in immediate danger.

Profits reached their second-highest point,
thanks to a bigger-than-usual div. received
from General Films. The uneven return
from that source is the chief cause of
the variations. The substantial improve-
ment on this occasion moved the directors
to a bonus of fid. per share in addition r«>
the usual 10 p.c., and a nice sum was left
over. Shareholders have received an average
of just on 10 p.c. since the old co. was
reconstructed in 1918, and they can see solid,
reserves of £82,525 supporting paid capital
of £96,443. There is a “capital reserve"
of £37,888. When the bales of paper were
handed out following the formation of Gen-
eral Film Go. of Australasia by West’s,
Spencer’s, Amalgamated and Greater J. D
Williams, this co. discounted the face value
of the holding by the amount mentioned.
This Column excludes it from its calcula-
tions. The co.’s theatres appear to send for-
ward a fairly even sum each year, and their
excellent situation should insure steady earn-
ings. It rakes in a little from its invest-
ments : Commonwealth loans have grown to
£24,158. Balance-sheet figures moved favor-

The shareholding in General Films is
£86,536, with £±0,40() lent on debentures
and £4OOO advanced to that concern. Exclud-
ing the share interest, net assets at March
81 totalled £84,730. That represents about
18s. for each £1 share, so there hasn’t to
be much value in the shareholding to make
a full 20s. for each £of capital. Although
divs. are erratic, an a verage of 10 p.c. p.a. seems
a reasonable expectation, with possibilities
of that becoming fhe minimum.

Supplying toothsmiths and sawbones has
never been a golt hoi business for this co.'s
shareholders. I ,ast results show that the
increased div. in 1926 was hasty, and the co.
hasn’t passed all the bumps in the road by
any means. This was one. of the industries
in which Germany had specialised, and her
re-entry into active business has created
trouble in prices—in one important line there
was a drop of 271 p.c. Nevertheless, tie-

Motor Finance, Ltd. (Sydney).—This
co. has more than lived up to its prospectus.
Profits have been greater, and for the second
time the 30,000 £1 prefs. received their 9
p.c., and the ordinaries (60,000) 121 p.c.
The public is interested only in the profs.
These shares are well secured, and, in addi-
tion to their right to 9 p.c. cum., they are
protected in other ways: only by a 75 p.c.
majority of holders, and then only when net
tangible assets amount to £3 for each £1
of pref. capital (including the new issue),
can further pref. shares be issued. Ordin-
aries are held chiefly by the motor-trading
firm which makes the sales (mostly motor-
cycles) which Motor Finance. Ltd., finances.
It is comforting to prefs. to see the remark-
ably low cost of running the business.
Administrative exes, last year amounted to
only £164, with £lll2 interest on bank
overdraft, £3504 provision for income-tax
and £697 appropriated to write off the last
of preliminary exes. The co. lias done very
well and now that preliminary exes, have
been cleared off there may be something in
it better even than p.c. for ordinaries.
Conditions, of course, have been excellent —
the country has been generally prosperous,
motor prices have been almost steadily re-
duced, and the bank and outsiders have been
obliging with accommodation. Such a com-
bination of circumstances cannot be greatly
improved. Indeed, so long has been the run
of prosperous years that setback of some
kind needs to be considered as a close prob-

Lead and spelter continue to move down.
Average prices for January, 1926, were:
Lead, £34 13s. 7d.; spelter, £37 14s. 3d.
For the year the averages were £3l 12s. 2d.
and £34 2s. Bd. Present prices are £24 17s. 6d.
and £29 ss. Most of this big drop will
come off profits, for costs remain about the
same, and there is not much relief to be
got from picking the ore, so Barrier balance-
sheets are going to suffer. B. H. South, for
instance, must have a lead product of about
35,000 tons a year, and of spelter close on
30,000 tons; so the hole the fall makes in
pi'ofits is big enough to bury a whale in.
Norths are, nevertheless, only 3s. and Souths
15s. lower than they were a year ago. North’s
production has increased, recoveries are a
little higher, and the slimes are being put
through, but all this will not avail to main-
tain anything like the old dividend rates
if the metal market does not. improve.

Associated Northern (W.A.) is reported
to be thinking of having a clearing sale of
has-been mines and plant and going out of
business. At the date of the last balance-
sheet its liquid assets were valued at about
£45,000. Since then some of the best of
them have been unloaded and holdings in
Wiluna Gold and Lorrain silver-mines in-
creased. The co. now has 25,000 £1 Wiluna
shares and 54,000 dollar shares in Lorrain.
Northern’s shares were last quoted at a
price which doesn’t nearly represent the
value of what the co. holds in shares and
cash, to say nothing of machinery and plant
and two Westralian shows which are still
capable of producing a little payable gold
even under present costly working condi-
tions. But that doesn’t necessarily mean
that the shares are too cheap. It depends
upon whether the co. hangs on to what it
has got.

Bremer Range gold deposits (W.A.) are
being talked about in the West. A Govern-
ment inspector of mines says the locality is
promising, and options on “finds” may be
hawked about Perth and Adelaide before
long. Bremer Range is about 100 miles
north of the Bight and about the same
distance west of Dundas. Its rocks are sim-
ilar to those at Southern Cross, from which
over £1,000,000 was won.

Boosting newspaper reports of Glenelg
Hills (W.A.) continue; nevertheless, options
are being abandoned almost every week. The
field has shoots of gold, but they seem to
die young. One in the Glenelg Queen,‘which
Jack McDermott optioned but didn’t purchase
started well, but soon was sick. Monte Carlo
Bank Co. has now got hold of this show,
and is booming it as something good. Some fair-
grade ore developed by McDermott is being
crushed by the Monte Carlo crowd at Cool-
gardie, and they hope that returns will be
attractive enough to cause a market flutter.
Shares may move up a little as a result of
inside support, but will come down when
selling pressure is applied.

Kanowna Red Hill (W.A.) has been laid
to rest. Floated among scores of other shows
at the time of the Hampton Plains boom in
1920, it was the only one of the lot that
ever paid a dividend. For a time it didn’t
get the gold that flotation reports promised
and was let to tributors. Good crushings,
which made the directors of the co. turn
green with envy, followed, and after a while
they retook possession. Since then it has
paid three 6d. divs. and has the unique
record among no-liability cos. in the West
of never having made a call. Small, rich
shoots were struck from time to time but
were never dependable, payable values being
liable to disappear any day. .In fact, Red
Hill at best was always a slippery place
in which to build castles.
“Prospector”: The par. re Wilga (W.A.)
coalfield (8.28/4/’27) was based on an official
report which, if it were written now, would
have to show quite different conclusions. At
the time it was compiled Collie Combine
had a monopoly of the Government coal
order. The Government is now offering any
new company capable of supplying it up to
20 p.e. of its orders, estimated to equal in
the near future about 100,000 tons per
annum. As a profit of ss. to 6s. per ton can
be earned, and prices are fixed and non-
competitive, there are good prospects for a
new co. provided with adequate working capi-
tal but not over-capitalised.

Marranboy, Arthur Clarke’s N.T. tin ven-
ture, is issuing 15,060 10 p.c. prefs. Half
of the issue has been taken up by the present
holders, and the balance is offered to the
public. A 20-head stamper mill has been
purchased. It is to be removed and erected,
and there are hopes of crushing by the end
of this year. The directors have guaranteed
the co. £3OOO to enable it to go ahead with
the battery scheme.
The Speck’s main lode-tin producer, Mount
Bischoff. paid another ss. div. in February.
It was the 484th taste. Last December share-
holders got refetive, and sent in a round
robin to the directors pleading for a Christ-
mas div. of 10s. to absorb only £6OOO out
of accumulated profits of over £BO,OOO. There
was nothing doing, because the problem of
treating the northern slopes and river flats
(the valley scheme), reported on specially
by Briseis manager Lindesay Clark, lay
ahead. Shareholders reckoned that that
would be equivalent to a new mine, and that
fresh capital should be called, rather than
that the work should be financed out of
accumulated profits, no div. having been paid
since October, 1920. However, just before
the annual meeting the div. was announced.
Chairman Percy Hart told shareholders that
the extension of operations would absorb
£20.000. The directors propose to keep
£lO,OOO behind them for that purpose, and
pay for the new scheme bit by bit. Every-
thing done to date in connection with the
scheme has been financed out of profits: the
sections have been bought.; timber cut for
pontoons, etc.; first instalment paid on the
machinery and plant, and all working ex-
penses met. The decision to push on with
the valley scheme is not untimely, for the
old mine must be nearing the end. For a
long time the fortnightly output was 18
tons of tin oxide, regular as clockwork, but
the latest one (the first in May) was two
tons short of the usual. In view of that
falling off, the new scheme is going to be
watched with anxious eyes.

After the extra bustle at Mt. Isa conse-
quent on the activities of the American
experts and their staff, the co. has settled
down again to steady prospecting and de-
velopment work. On the Rio Grande lode
a distance of 430 ft. has been driven at the
150 ft. level and both ends are in good ore.
Certainly a trifle low in silver, but much
of the ore is carbonate, and thus somewhat,
leached in silver values. Samples of the
full width of the drive average IS p.c. lead
and lOoz. of silver: On the Black Star a
drill was put through at a position 380 ft.
north of the Davidson shaft. It was pulled
out, at 578 ft. Assay results of. core sections
are not yet released. The drill is now punch-
ing into the Black Rock north of O’Doherty
shaft; the proposal is to test it at 500 ft.
in sulnhides. The Rock has proved the
richest lode on the field over its full width
in the carbonate zone. All the others im-
proved as they moved down into sulphides,
particularly the Mt. Isa, which was quite
a low-grade proposition on top.

“W.”: Everything is not put down on
paper even in the most voluminous report.
After watching Titcomb and Goeppart on
the job at Mt. Isa I formed the definite
opinion that they were anxious to exercise
the ontion. In explaining why it was turned
down I would place the following considera-
tions in order of merit: (1) High taxation
and fear that it will go higher still; (2)
heavy freights; (3) loss in recovery from
carbonate ore; (4) distance from coal and
coke and quality (freight on high ash fuel
enters here). Titcomb thinks the geological
conditions point to the. lodes going to great
depth.

The half-million tons of coal recently
proved by the Mines Department, and locked
up in a State reserve near Howard, Burrum
coalfield (Q.), are to be offered for public
application. This has been decided by
Cabinet after many deputations and invalid
applications for leases. Three cos. are tread-
ing on each others’ heels to get the land.
An equitable plan would be to divide the
block and let them prove more coal outside
of the already proved area.

Mt. Morgan marshalled a long array of
statistics for the Tariff Board at the Bris-
bane sitting in support of a claim for a
£lO copper bounty on metal produced and
refined in Australia. The co., however, was
not able to say that the bounty would mean
keeping the mine and works producing with
copper at £66. The granting, of it would
only assist in arriving at a decision when
the report of E. E. Barker, the Utah Copper
Co. expert imported last year, comes to hand.
Barker found that the decision on the new
scheme of operation showed such a narrow
margin that he delayed his report to give
him time to consult two American colleagues.
The co.’s objective output is 18,000 tons a
week, so the decision is momentous for
Queensland.

A good gold-reef find is reported from the
outskirts of the old Palmer alluvial field
(N.Q.). It has made more noise than any
other since Mt. Coolon jumped into notice.
The reef lias been sunk on to a depth of
50ft. and is said to reach a width of 6ft.
The gold assays have caused excitement, the
best reading 107 oz. and 920 z., while lOoz.
is quite commonplace. However, the unin-
formed public needs to be informed that
assays alone mean very little. The reef

would give an assay to suit the most opti-
mistic flotation expert. If the above samples
represent the average of the width of Oft.,
then we can begin to throw up our hat.

ment that the public w r on’t be asked to come
in until things are O.lv.’d. Walter .Collie

the reef, and publication of his report is
promised. It looks as if it might be a good
thing after weary years of waiting.

Sundown tin and arsenic mine, Ballan-
dean (Q.), has been dewatered and started
on another run. Manager Teague is pro-
ducing about 20cwt. of tin per week, but
only half capacity—five head of stamps—
is being used. Whether the mine and plant
will be run at full pressure depends on
prospecting work. More feed in sight is
wanted to keep 10 head running continu-
ously. Its neighbor, Beecroft arsenic-mine,
owned by O. C. Roberts, is closed down.
Roberts finds it cheaper to buy arsenious
oxide for his Wallangarra poison plant than
work the Beecroft. Freight kills the raw
ore.

“Old Prospector”: “Old Warden’s” com-
ment on Fifield Gold and Platinum (B.
19/5/’27) reminds me that the general aver-
age of the ground is very shallow. The
original prospectors gave the shallow gutter,’
where they got their best prospects, a good
trial with a puddler about 1890. It was
scarcely a tucker job. I did some prospect-
ing there later on and failed to find anything
to induce optimism. It also lies in a very
dry area.

Gunong is an offshoot of Twyford Malayan
Tin with practically the same directorate,
including veteran Joe Millican, formerly of
Charters Towers. The lately-launched pro-
spectus gives capital as £50,000 in 200,000
ss. shares. The co. is acquiring 160 acres
at Gunong Kantang, some 16 miles from
Ipoh. The area is part of a 324-acres option
originally bored by Tin Lands Consolidated.
Check-boring by C. J. Rowe, field engineer
for Twyford Malayan, was responsible for
the selection of the 160 acres comprised in
the Gunong area. Rowe estimates that it
contains 41 million yards, averaging
to the yard. A bucket dredge with a capa-
city of 40.000 c.y. per month has been
ordered. Digging costs are estimated at 4d.
per yard, though 7d. is more common. Twy-
ford Malayan takes 40.000 f.p. shares and
£13.176 in cash. Of this, £8176 is to be
paid to the original owners. In addition
shareholders are offered 40,000 contribs., and
the public is to be allowed to come in on
the remaining 120,000 contrib. shares.

Malayan tin-dredging returns for the first
half of May show general improvement in
spite of several stoppages. Malim Nawar,
with a five days’ stoppage, was the wwst
sufferer, realising only seven tons in 199
hours with 85,000 c.y. turned over. The
dredge’s best return to date is 20 tons from
110,000 cubic yards in December last, or
an average of ,41b. It will have to do a
lot better to realise the boring average of
.821 b. It is hoped that the end of the
current month will see the dredge out of the
difficult ground which first had to be cleared.
Costs keep well under £2OOO per month.
Malim Nawar South, with the big dredge
fairly going, took out 30 tons from 68.000
yards in 283 hours—good going and a trifle
better than Newman’s estimate of 11b. per
c.y. There is a big area of 50,000,000 yards,
15,000,000 of it, however, rated as only .751 b.
ground. The first div. of Is. is due May 31.
A heavy and valueless overburden of 45ft.
adds to digging costs. Larut Combine’s four
dredges returned 48 tons of tin from 157,000
yards, a slight improvement on last month’s
averages, and better, than the prospectus
estimate of 90 tons per month. Flu Yam,
with 201 tons from 50,000 yards, 1.21 b.
to the yard, is going better than ever—the
co. began dredging in January, 1922, and has
paid Bs. 6d. in divs. since then. Ronpihon
(22 tons from 45.000 yards) and Kampong
(25 tons from 54.000 tons) also show
returns calculated to warm the hearts of
shareholders.

Silaya Tin, a Malayan-Siamese prospect-
ing co. which was registered in Sydney last
December, with C. McDowell, J. H. King
and A. Vickery as directors, lias been hunt-
ing for likely dredging propositions. The
directors now report that an option has been
taken over an area at Bandon, Southern
Siam, after preliminary testing by John
Marshall, the co.’s field engineer. Boring
will be started as soon as possible, and the
area thoroughly tested. Options have also
been taken over other areas in Southern
Siam, and prospecting arrangements are in
hand. Silaya’s authorised capital is £70.000
in £1 shares; 50,000 contribs. have been
issued, paid up to 2s.

Austral Asiatic, a Sydney-registered con-
cern, is out with a further report of boring
results on its Tarua and Muang Tuat pro-
perties, and these tend to confirm earlier
figures. On M'uang Tuat, 190 of tli e 300
acres available have been close-bored by A.
C. S. McLeod, for an average of over 14oz.
to the yard. On the Tarua, 10 miles from
Muang Tuat, three million yards have been
proved by close boring to average 19.70 z.
Another option has been taken over a South-
ern Burmese area about 20 miles from
lienong, and this is to be scout-bored shortly.
Depths average 13 feet on Tarua and 21 on
Muang Tuat. The shallowness is the only
fly visible in the rich cream.

“G.D.M.”: Surprising results are being
obtained by the U.S. Bureau of Mines from
the refining of oil distilled from Colorado
oil shales. Yields as high as 80 p.c. of
petrol have been produced in a commercial
plant by simple distillation at atmospheric
pressure. If further tests prove that the
process is commercially practicable, it will
be good pews for Australia because of the
large deposits of oil shale in N.S.W. and
Tasmania.

Prospectus of Issue of 100,000 “D” S| Per Cent. Cumulative
Participating Preference Shares of £1 each .
At an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Shareholders in Arthur
Rickard & Co. Extended, Ltd., held on the 20tli April, 1027, a Resolution was
passed providing, inter alia, for the creation of “200,000 8i per cent. Cumula-
tive Preference ‘IP Shares of £1 each, ranking in all respects after the existing
issue of "C' and ‘A Cumulative Preference Shares and ranking for the return
of Capital in priority to all other shares in the Capital of the Company except
the said ‘C' and ‘A: Cumulative Preference Shares and with the right to such
‘IP Shares to further participate in the surplus profits equally with the ‘IP
ordinary shares after the ‘IP ordinary shares shall have received 81 per cent,
(but with a total limit to the ‘IP shares of 10 per cent.). Such ‘IP shares to
be Cumulative as to the 81 per cent, dividend only, but such ‘IP shares not to
confer the right to any further or other participation in profits except as above
stated or any further right to participate in surplus assets on liquidation.
Such ‘IP shares to be called ‘D’ 81 per cent. Cumulative Participating Pre-
ference Shares and to be under the control of the Directors who may allot
or otherwise dispose of the same to such persons on, such terms and conditions
including an option of purchase and either at a premium or otherwise and
at such times as the Directors think fit Provided that not more than 100,000
of such 200,000 ‘IP shares shall be issued until such time as the Reserve Fund
of the Company and so much of the fully paid up capital of the Company as is
represented by ‘TP ordinary shares together total the sum of £380,000* at the
least and then the balance may be issued.”
*Tliat is an increase of £100,000 on the present total.
Subscriptions are now invited for 100,000 of these 200,000 “D” 81 per
cent. Cumulative Participating Preference Shares (hereinafter referred to as
“TP* shares), being the moiety available for issue at the present time. It will
be noted that these “D” Shares have priority over the “B” Ordinary Shares,
which was formerly agreed to by the holders of the latter shares at a Meeting
of that class held on the 20th April, 1927, at the close of the Extraordinary
General Meeting above mentioned.
The position is as follows:—
Present capital and reserves—
“(P Preference Shares
“A" Preference Shares
“B" Ordinary Shares
Reserves ..
£100,000
200,000
£300,000

£280,000
Total £580,000
To which add proposed issue of “D” shares . .. 100,000
Total £680,000
It will be seen that after deducting from the above the sum of £300,000,
representing the total capital ranking prior to the “D” Shares, there would
remain £380,000 to protect the £100,000 of “D” Shares, equal to £3/16/- pei
Share.
L he assets of the Company as shown in the Balance Sheet are conserva-
tively valued and do not include any intangible assets, such as goodwill, etc.
For the past eight years the dividends on the “C” and “A” Preference
Shares have been paid quarterly, which has proved very convenient and
satisfactory to the holders. It is intended to extend this privilege to the
holders of the “D” shares.
The “W Ordinary Shareholders have been paid during the past seven
years dividends ranging from 6 per cent, to 8 per cent, per annum, and in
addition have received 100,000 Bonus Shares of £1 each, representing the
capitalisation of part of the profits during that period accumulated in the
Reserve Fund. No further capitalisation of reserves can be made without
the consent of the holders of “D” shares.
This Company, considered together with its main operating Company,
Arthur Rickard & Co., Ltd., has a record of twenty-three years of successful
trading in. Real Estate. It has followed a policy of liberal treatment of
purchasers, and its name and methods are favorably known throughout the
Commonwealth. The experience thus gained, and the reputation built up
during this long period, form an additional asset, which, while it cannot
be expressed in figures, is of far-reaching importance.
A return of 81 per cent, per annum so amply secured, with the prospect
of an increase to as much as 10 per cent, per annum, is such an inviting
investment at the present time that the Directors would emphasise the
advisability of early application.

Willie Watt was, unintentionally, respon-
sible for bringing Ned Hogan, Vic.’s new
Labor Premier, into politics. He gave
Hogan his chance by appointing the then
sitting member for ’ Warrenheip, G. F.
Holden, Chairman of the Melbourne Harbor
Trust, which involved resignation from Par-
liament. Hogan happened to be on the spot
—he was over on a visit from Westralia,
where he was union secretary—and as a
6ft. Sinn, lad, who had helped iiis struggling
dad on the farm and done a man’s work
since he was 12, he appealed strongly to
Warrenheip. And Warrenheip has been true
to him for 14 years. Hogan held the Agri-
culture and Railway portfolios under Pren-
dergast in 1924.
For the first time this century Vic. has
had a Government formed Avithout a “Mac”
in it. When electing Ministers the Labor
party rejected the one available (McNamara.
M.L.C.) in favor of Williams, of the same
House. The Elmslie Labor Government had
McLellan, M.L.C., and the Prendergast Mini-
stry McNamara. The Allancocks had three
Macs—McDonald, McGregor and Mackrell.
James McCulloch was Premier four times
between ’63 and ’75, J. A. MaePherson led
the Government in ’69-70, and McLean in
’99-1900.
It looks as if the Vic. Speakership will
go to Peacock, now an ordinary M.L.A.
Charles Gavan Duffy, Graham Berry, Dun-
can Gillies and John Bowser were elected

Bent wore the wig before becoming head of
the Government.
Thirty-three years ago James Franklin,
noAV Mayor of Perth —he welcomed Albert as
a C.M.G. —was a brickworks inspector in
the employ of the N.S.W. railways, at Goul-
burn. The heads did him a good turn un-
consciously by singling him out for the axe
during a retrenchment period. He at once
went to Westralia, and has done so well
there as a builder that N.S.W. couldn’t get
him back again on any terms.
Adelaide laAvyers are wondering who will

junior Bar are Ligertwood (a member of
the firm that gave the Bench Parsons and
Napier), Mayo, Thomson and Stuart. The
last-named is filling Poole’s place as acting-
judge.

Hudson Maxim has followed his better-
known brother Hiram across the Jordan.
The pair were printers when they began

Hiram made the machine-gun which carries

into eternity without knowing that death
was approaching. Hudson, who was 74 at
the end, had hobbies of the most peaceful
character. Amongst other publications he
was the author of “The Science of Poetry

It has been left, to Warwick, one of the
oldest towns of Bananaland, to pile up a
bit of cement in honor of Allan Cunningham,
who crossed the Macpherson liange and

The mayors of Brisbane, Warwick, Ipswich

When Charles Lindbergh made the long
hop from New York to Paris, 3350 miles in
33 hours, the earth, already very small,
pulled its belt a couple of notches tighter.
The flight is incomparably the finest solo
performance yet recorded, and will go down
in the history of aviation as a demonstra-
tion of endurance on the part of the flier
and reliability on the part of the machine.
But when that history is written, no matter
what may happen in the years that are to
come, there will have to be special mention
of the colossal cheek of Australian airman
Parer and his mate Mclntosh. They piled
into an ancient ’plane tied together with
bits of wire and patched with all sorts of
material, and they coaxed the contraption
through the air all the way from London
to Sydney. When a Sydneyite asked Parer
what he was going to do about a big hole
in one of his plane’s wings, Parer looked
businesslike and said : “We’ll fix that in no
time. We’ve got some very strong brown
paper.” And with a brown-paper patch they
flew to Melbourne.
After being in the water since Midwinter’s
day, 1912, a bottle containing a message
from some members of Douglas Mawson's
Antarctic expedition of 1911 washed ashore
on Tuggerah Beach (N.S.W.). Two of the
signatories are easily traceable. A. L. Ken-
nedy is assistant astronomer at the Federal
observatory at Canberra, while Lieutenant-
Commander Merton 11. Moyes is an instruc-
tor at Flinders Naval Base. Moyes still
wonders how he had the luck to get into
that expedition. He came down from Queens-
land. where he had been engineering, in
quest of Mawson and ran him to earth in
Sydney. They had been schoolfellows in
Adelaide. “No need to worry about you,”
said Mawson, “you look splendid !” Moyes
was just then riddled with dengue, and it
took him hve months in the polar cold to
realise that he was alive.
Dear Bulletin, —This avus the way of it.
Lewis was a Federal Minister without port-
folio from January 1, 1901 —-when the Com-
monwealth was created. He did not, how-
ever, put up for Parliament, and resigned
before the Parliament met. James R. Dick-
son was Minister for Defence at the start,
but he died only nine days later (January
10). I succeeded him on February 2, and,
as F’orrest preferred Defence to the Post
Office, I became Postmaster-General.—Yours
sincerely, James G. Drake.
C. J. French, Avho came to Adelaide from
8. Africa about four months ago to act as
curator of the snake park recently estab-
lished near the local zoo, was not accli-
matised to local venoms. From long experi-
ence he believed himself immune from
reptilian poisons. But during a demonstra-
tion a large tiger-snake bit him on the wrist,
and he died soon afterwards.
O’Malley Wood, tipped to remain a N.S.W.
Savings Bank Commissioner, has had his
ups and downs. Born, on the Lachlan 60-odd
years ago he was once marooned on the
uncivilised side for two months through
floods. He and a blackfellow replenished
their pantry by taking a lamb or tAvo from
near-by flocks. Wood’s first job was as a
shop-assistant on Gulgong diggings—wages,
10s. per week; hours, 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., with
“sitdown” and “sack” synonymous terms.
He entered the Civil Service as a surveyor
and was stationed at Queanbeyan, where, in
1885, he had a chance to run for Parliament.
He didn’t take it, and E. W. O’Sullivan was
elected, commencing thus a very long political
career.
Bill Roden, who passed out at Hobart the
other day, was one of the famous stockriders
of the Speck in his young days. He made
stockwhips, too, and supplied a big demand.
After his boss, Tom Field, of Westfield, died,
Roden joined the police. Some of his con-
temporaries who survive are Tom Shaw of
Parkliam, Tom Brown of Deloraine and Bill
Bonney of Westbury, avlio between them
total up about 250 years.
Ex-Premier John Allan (Vic.) has been
elected president of Deakin Shire Council,
which sits at Tongala. It was meant kindly,
but the £75 a year, or whatever the alloAv-
ance is (probably about enough to pay for
lunch when attending meetings), will be
poor compensation for what John is dropping.
He drew £l5OO p.a. as Premier.
The Defence Department is likely to be-
come more strictly departmental than ever
now that Malcolm Lindsay Shepherd is to
be its secretary. He has been secretary to the
High Commissioner in London for six years.
Shepherd joined the
N.S.W. Public Ser-
vice as a boy of 17
in 1890. After the
Commonwealth ar-
rived his suavity
got him a job as
Prime Minister’s
secretary, and when
the Prime Minister
decided that h e
wanted a depart-
ment all to himself
Shepherd became
secretary of that.
His London job
goes to Tom
Trumble, who was
a Defence Depart-
ment officer in Vic.
when defence was a
local affair, was

Government in
London.
Just dead in Maoriland. W. Field Porter,
one of the hardy men who helped to open
up the pearl-shell beds and b§che-de-mer
grounds of the Barrier and Torres Strait.
He survived the disastrous Cape Melville
cyclone which wrecked a hundred boats and
drowned over 300 men. Porter had his wife
and baby daughter with him in his schooner
Crest of the Wave. One huge wave actually
snatched the child from its mother's arms
—to swirl it back into the cabin in the back-
wash. It was only by hacking away the
masts that Porter Avas able to ride out the
storm. A fine sailor and a stout-hearted
pioneer.
THE AIR VOYAGERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We left the city ere break of day, while, the
city was still in bed.
The western sky was a murky grey and the
east was a sketchy red.
The river was likewise in its bed, where it
travelled on slow, w T et feet;
A homeless breeze made rustling sounds like
ghosts in xi field of wheat.
We drove to the port where our great ship
lay on the grass of the heaving park.
Her priceless cargo was all on board ; she
Avas down to the Plimsoll mark.
Her motley crew were Pilot McKay and Air-
mechanic McKee,
And two passengers lounged in the grand
saloon, Augustus Sadd and me.
We weighed the anchor and heaved the lead,
and we set a press pf sail,
We blew off steam, and we blew the gaff,
and we waited a friendly gale.
A stowaway man went overside to lighten
the cumbered bark.
His name was Jonah. We cheered as he
made a meal for a roving shark.
The pumps were manned, for some fool
alleged that the water was gaining fast.
The siren blew for a whole xveek through
with a terrified, screechy blast.
Then we rose with a jerk, and the sun rose
too, in splendid raiment clad.
And we danced up a ladder of golden light,
I and Augustus Sadd.
We sighted some angels and asteroids, and
a stranded comet or two,
One was ablaze, and we passed the hat for
the wives of the hapless crew.
An old tramp rainbow crossed our track, and
we carelessly ran it down;
It fell in flames and in smithereens on the
roofs of a staggered town.
A Soul trudged by on its way above (pil-
grims that way are rare)
A lady Soul, dressed, of course, in. white,
with a halo in its hair.
Our road was smooth—not like earthly roads,
which,are rocky,, muddy and mad.
And we Acav along it like hunted hares, I
and Augustus Sadd.
Great cities spread beloAv xve scanned through
holes in the misty floor.
Our craft skipped noxv over bits of sea and
then over bits of shore.
We found numerous mansions in the sky,
“To Let” and in disrepair.
We heard the roar of wild debauch from
some castles in the air.
We chased the bright hours round the clock
and arrested one or two,
And we raced a half-moon for a bet till it.
meanly sneaked from view.
Then Dusk loomed up with its mask of
stealth and its cloak of hypocrisy,
So we slid to earth down a stair of stars,
Augustus Sadd and me.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES - LINSEED OIL
“Biliai": Fish smelling of iodoform are
not rare in tropical waters, but I have never
known any to be caught on outside reefs,
or away from the area of human habita-
tion. The theory that fish so affected have
been feeding on a variety of seaweed heavily
impregnated with iodine is tenable. In
Papua this seaweed has its habitat in the
fairly quiet waters of bays or inlets, where
LAUGH AND GROW FAT.
CANNIBAL: “Look here, my friend, if you don’t laugh
and grow fat, I’ll have to put you to the indignity
of making a mere stew of you!”
sewage from a township or native village
contaminates it; only fish caught in such
waters has the taint. Balala, a snapper-
like fish, probably similar to the one men-
tioned by “Sea Nomad” (B. 31/3/’27), when
caught in such a place is pretty rank, and
the parrot-fish is quite uneatable.
“Xepa”: Most ground-feeding fish on the
Barrier Reef and a good many mid-water
fish live on small crustaceans that frequent
or grow on patches of seaweed. The peculi-
arity “Sea Nomad" mentions is not confined
to this snapper, but at certain seasons may
be noticed amongst the ground and mid-
water feeders. Fish taken on the Barrier
from Cooktown to Port Curtis carry the
aroma faintly. I have noticed the smell on
rock- and coral-cod, scorpion, red emperor,
groper, parrot and grey snapper, but never
on mackerel, king, barramundi or salmon.
In prawns and shrimps it is particularly
distinct at this period, and renders them
practically inedible.
“AdeL.”: I can bear witness to the use-
lessness of Queensland’s expensive vermin-
proof border fence in the state of disrepair
it has fallen into. Many parts of this fence
are fired during the hot, windy months of
September and October, and repairs are
not made till after the wet season, about
April to August. In the following months
other sections are burned down either acci-
dentally or deliberately, and remain un-
restored till the following winter months.
Apart from this, the fence is not vermin-
proof. Bunny gets under the wire wherever
he likes, and the dingoes vault over it for
exercise. At the northern end, in the Burke-
town district, wallabies and wild pigs have
made a well-beaten path through the net-
ting.
“Biliai”: In the days of Sir William Mac-
gregor a small herd of deer was introduced
into Papua by a storekeeper and liberated
near Port Moresby. For many years neither
native nor white was allowed to hunt them,
and they multiplied till they became a pest.
Nowadays it is a not uncommon sight to see
50 or 60 in a herd in the hills behind the
town, where they do damage to the native
gardens, so much so that the embargo on
hunting them has been removed. No-
thing in the way of a native-made fence
will keep them out. It is said that the deer
have spread to the Ivokoda district; if so,
they have crossed the Owen Stanley Range,
the lowest pass of which is 7000 ft. up.
=l= :i! *
“Atherton” : Civilisation is fast robbing the
native of his skill and knowledge of the
wild. In all except the few tribes as yet
untouched by the white man the young
bucks, instead of becoming 'warriors, go
working on the northern fishing-fleets and
cattle-stations. They eat the white man’s
tucker, wear his clothes and assimilate a
distorted conception of his habits and his
commoner thought. There is no longer
need of unceasing training in the habits of
animals, birds, reptiles and fishes, the phases
of the seasons and the laws governing edible
plant growth. At least once a year the abo.
returns to the tribe, but if the season is
dry, and game consequently scarce, he can
go back to the white man for easily-earned
food. The younger generation has already
lost a great stock of nature lore that took
its forefathers centuries of striving and
hunger to accumulate. Many of the young
fellows cannot even spear a’wallaby. And
the fathers of the tribes, seeing their people
dissolving into nothingness, and despairing
of keeping their heritage intact, are carry-
ing the deeper tribal secrets with them to the
grave.
“Fitzo”: Every bush town
has its haunted shanty, and
Yarralong was no exception.
We were returning late one
night, after a hard day’s
search in the bush for scrub-
bers. and had reached the
outskirts of the township
when a storm broke. Hastily
we made for a hut in a
near-by paddock. Dave was
the first to reach the door
and open it. Instantly
something unseen shot out
of the darkness of the hut
and knocked us both off our
feet. We scrambled up and,
heedless of the rain, which
was now pouring down in
sheets, ran for our lives. Ten
minutes later w~e staggered
into the pub. “Strath!”
gasped the barman, “’Ave y’
seen a ghost?” “Yes,” Dave
gasped, “up there at the
shanty. It’s ’aunted. Jist
as I opened the door some-
thin’ flew out and knocked
us both off our feet. It’s a
ghost, all right.” Then
Bluey, who was drinking a
pint, exploded. “Ghost, me
foot!” he roared. “If you’ve
let my ole sow out again, I’ll
stoush yer.”
“Wang": “I’ve read an’ heerd of some
’strordinary ’lopements in me day," re-
marked old Dan, “but th’ ’strordinariest wus
one I seen with me own eyes. It were
years ago now, when a big flood come down
th’ ’Bidgee. I was workin’ in a township
on th’ river bank fer a mis’rable ole skin-
flint who kept th’ store there; Jinks wus
his name. He had a daughter, a good-lookin’
piece, who wus gone on a young bloke who
had a s’lection farther up tli’ river. But
ole Jinks wus dead-set agen Aggie marryin’
this young bloke, Bill Hapsley, an’ whenever
Bill come near th’ place he useter sool th’
dogs on him. Well, th’ flood come down.
First it wusn’t much ter worry about; but
it kep’ gettin’ higher an’ higher till at last
ev’rybody wus forced to climb on top of their
house an’ camp there. Aggie’s room wus
a little distance from th’ store, an’ while
ole Jinks an’ his missus an’ me is on th’
top of th’ store Aggie’s perched away on
her lonesome on th’ rdof of her room half
a chain away. Th’ first mornin’ after we’ve
taken to th’ roofs we see young Hapsley
com e sailin’ down on th’ body of a waggon,
He’s got a lump of wood what lie’s usin’
as an oar, an’ he works tIT contraption oyer
to -Aggie’s perch. She gets in alongside him,
“FROM ONE WHO KNOWS.”
CUSTOMER (to proprietor) : “I notice you proclaim that you make your own sausages.”
PROPRIETOR: “Yes, sir, we do.”
CUSTOMER: “May I make a suggestion that would be of very material benefit to your
trade?”
P ROPRIETOR: “Certainly, sir — certainly.”
CUSTOMER: “Get somebody else to make ’em!”
an’ doesn’t ole Jinks perform! Across th’
way, ’bout a hundred yards off, is th’ parson
an’ his fambly squatted on th’ roof of their
house. Th’ parson’s got a book in his hands
an’ tli’ next thing we sees is young Hapsley
workin’ his craft across. Then we see
him an’ th’ parson havin’ a yap tergether.
Soon afterwards we twigs them kneelin’ in
front of th’ parson, an’ him readin’ outer
tli’ book —marryin’ ’em, that’s what he wus
doin’. Ole Jinks nearly breaks a hole through
th’ store roof, roarin’ an’ jumpin’ about, an’
threatenin’ all sorts of things. But it's no
use; they wus married fair an’ square. Th’
flood lvent down that day, an’ tli’ parson
explains ter ole Jinks that he thought we
wus all goners, an’ that Bill an’ Aggie would
die happier tergether if they wus married.”
:Js *
“Bargona” : It would seem that the hoary
superstition which credited snakes with an
appreciative ear for music must go the way
of the tales about cow’-milking and offspring-
swallowing serpents. London Zoo has con-
cluded a series of musical experiments on
its tenants. While mpst of them expressed
delight or the reverse, not a snake could
be got to take the least interest in the per-
formance or to give any evidence of having
even heard the music. Other reptiles, such
as crocs., paid rapt attention to the concert,
even climbing on the banks of their pools
to hear better.
* * * *
“Gouger” : Great fishing is to be had in
the Barrier and Torres Strait waters. Every
lugger trails a tow-line, its bait a strip of
white cloth w’hich twirls on the water like
a live fish. The whiter the cloth the greater
the chance of attracting surface fish. The
Thursday Islanders get fine sport from
launches, rod-fishing. The tackle is neces-
sarily long and strong, as a 601 b. “king” or
trevalla fights like a tiger. Black trevalla,
kingfish and barramundi have been caught
in these waters up to 1001 b. in weight.
Queen- and white-fish are whoppers, too,
with a trick of jumping high in the water
to shake the hook from their mouths. Tre-
valla and kingfish often “shoal,” shooting
quick sprays over an acre of Avater. When
a patch of fish is met with the launch circles
at slow speed to the song of the whizzing
reels. There is no such thing as biting; the
big fellows simply savage the bait, then
smoke the reel. With a number of rods
working, and a racing whopper on each
Jine, the thrill is sustained and intense
Sometimes a shoal can be kept in play for
two hours, when the catch is phenomenal,
A spoon bait is used. For deep-line enthu-
siasts there are always snapper, Spanish
fish, yellow-tail, coral-fish, cod and a host
of others; for those who like big stuff thera
are the giant groper, which run into hun-
dredweights, the half-ton dugong and the
over-a-ton diamond-fish.
* * * *
“Bill R.”: Between the outer wall of
weatherboard and the inner Baltic-pine lin-
ing of a house being demolished at Ando
(N.S.W.) were discovered clusters of excel-
lent grapes, attached to spindly vine-stalks
that had crept through chinks between the
boards. Confined to the narrow space the
fruit had grown flat and elongated, and the
bunches were so compressed that they could
not be shaken apart. Nevertheless, especi-
ally those nearest the chimney, they were
much better specimens than the clusters
that hung outside the walls. The shelter
and warmth had evidently nourished them.
LOOKING HER OVER.
OWNER (to prospective buyer): “No roads
too ’ard for ’er. She's gone everywhere.
P. B.: “Yes, I can see she is!”
“Cuchulain” : Old Tom scratched his head
and spat out his “chew” before answering
my question. “These Bulleteen , coves are
alwus givin’ quick-shearin’ records,” he said,
“but they ain’t records like the old days.
Look at Jack Harvey—he did his 120 by
hand, easy. I remember a wager he had
once. He shore, killed, skinned, dressed,
cut up, cooked ’n’ ate a chop inside o lu
minutes.”

■'She ought to go the ounce,” said Bill,
“I’ve picked her over well.
She ought to pay all right, but still
A man can never tell.
The best of us get blown to bits,
The soundest tips will fail
At times. There’s no denying it’s
The battery tells the tale.
“But still, the ounce seems safe enough.
Or p’r’aps a little more,
I’ve kept my eye upon the stuff—
I’ve fallen in before.
I wouldn’t, sure as I’m alive —
I tell you this as mates—
Be too surprised at twenty-five
Or even thirty ’weights.

Though some are rather low—
Are good enough, it wouldn’t stir
Me much if she should go—
No points in my deceiving chaps
Who know and understand —

Another in the sand.”

To swell our party’s score,

And richer William’s ore.

The car and tyres you select for your requirements are
either suited to the purpose or they are not. All cars
and tyres are not alike, and therein lies the need for
careful selection of an automobile. As regards tyres,
many motorists are careless in this respect, and when
purchasing a car or tyre replacements just take what-
ever tyres happen to be fitted, or offered, irrespective
as to whether they are of sufficient strength and quality
to withstand hard work on Australian roads. Safe-
guard your interests in this direction by specifying

and thus start away with high grade covers and tubes
that will ensure you many thousands of miles of trouble*

quality, for we make only one grade, the best, and
motorists can always rely on obtaining value and
economical service by using them. Don’t take
any tyre offered, demand “Dunlop.” They
cost no more, the difference is in the extra
mileage you obtain. Garages stock
them in Cords and Balloons.

“Ledraw" : I had a cat: whom I saw chase
a rat into an old box full of rubbish, and
there kill it. I missed puss for a few T days,
then going to the box for some paper was
surprised to find her coiled up mothering
four young rats. I had drowned her kittens
some days before, so she had adopted the
enemy’s youngsters. She reared them suc-

cessfully, and it was interesting to watch
her bringing dead mice and birds for them
to eat. One rat: developed a distinct purr
and I was hopeful of keeping it for exhibi-
tion purposes; but it fell into a bucket of
water.
“Iverys”: To the fears of the Maoriiand
Government that the fishing-grounds round
the Bay of Islands and Bay of Plenty may
be depleted Zane Grey gives a comforting
reply. It all comes down, says the author-
angler, to a matter of climate. Maoriiand,
with its inconstant weather and tempestu-
ous seas, is never likely to have the grounds
over fished. This year the overseas visitors
have fished only about half-time. There is also
the volcanic element to be considered: in
some places submarine upheavals send the
big fish scurrying to less exciting waters.
But, in Grey’s opinion, the plenitude of
food in the Maoriiand seas will always
attract big fish in huge numbers, and the
roughness of the ocean prevent the angler
from catching over-many of them.
"E.W.S.”: I can’t say what voltage is
required to kill a rat (B. 21/4/’27), but
if takes more than 240 volts to kill a centi-
pede. I found a lively fellow whilst string-
ing the dinner beans, and called one of my
men folk to dispatch it. He took it into
the adjoining room, an electrical workshop,
where he was engaged in testing 240-volt
bulbs. Two wires were attached, one to either
end of the insect, and he “sizzled.” Smoke
came as he burnt. When he ceased to move
he was left on a piece of timber on the
bench. Twenty minutes later a very lively
centipede was observed making for shelter.
“The Rumpus”: With the advent of
motor power, liorse-bells and hobbles are
vanishing. In one sense this is well. Belling
and hobbling were not a fair deal to neddy.
My father owned a chestnut moke at Yep-
poon (Q.) that after years of bell and hobble
used to wait outside the gate at night for
his equipment. He could canter quite com-
fortably when shackled; and swimming a
50-yard-wide saltwater creek in hobbles,
and clambering up the other side over
smooth-worn rocks, was no great feat for
him.

“Pfella”: Riding along the dry bed of a
creek running through a plain of dwarf
mulga in the nor’-west of Groperland, 1
heard a medley of sound. I reined in my
neddy and saw a flock of white cockatoos
harassing a kangaroo, which was coming
straight in my direction. The yellowcrests
flew low, screeched hideously and beat angry
wings in the ’roo’s face. Half a dozen were
riding their victim’s back, with hook-beaks
biting into-the fur. The maddened ’roo came
blindly on and lobbed fair in the centre of
a clump of snakewood, crawfling under a
thousand prongs for safety and in the pro-
cess tearing birds off its back. The cockatoos
flew round and round their quarry till, with
half a dozen stones, I put them to flight.
“Momokeni”: On
a canoe journey m
the Purari Delta
one of the pad-
dlers, wanting a
lig h t for his
“cigar" roll of
newspaper a n d
trade tobacco, com-
menced to make
fire with a stick of
hardwood, a few
shreds of fibre rav
oiled from a rope-
end and a groove
in the side of the
boat. I watched
until the sparks
came, a matter of
a few moments
only; then, taking
the stick from the
liremaker, now
p u ffi n g at his
lighted “cigar.” I
essayed to repeat
the operation, hav-
ing the advantages
of the still hot
groove and the
smoking fibre. In
spite of the energy
t expended I had
to give it up as
hopeless. The
whole crew in-
formed me that,
being a woman, I
never could make
fire, the art being
solely confined to
men. Later in-
quiries at various
villages corrobo-
rated this, and I
never found a
Papuan woman
who could, or
would, attempt to
make fire. Does
this apply to Australian aboriginal women
also ?

“Up Top”: Give plants their head and
they become wild in a very short time. If
edible they lose their food-giving properties
and run to leaves and stalks, or if flower
plants the blooms quickly lose their size and
beauty. In the early days the miners on the
tropical Queensland fields planted orange,
lemon, mandarin, banana and mango trees,
also pineapples and maniocs. sw T eet potatoes
and other vegetables. Most of the old fields
are now abandoned. The banana-trees have
gone completely wild, being now only shrubs
with tiny fruit all seeds. Many lemon-trees
survive and still bear small, crude products.
The orange-trees have died or no longer bear
sweet fruit. On many old fields an odd man-
darin-tree is still to bo found, but its fruit is
nearly always wooden. The mangoes have
thriven best, but not so well as when near
civilisation. Pineapples are scattered in
"IT DON'T SEEM SIX MUNCE SINCE WE LAST MET, DO IT?”
many places; the plants are smallish with
very dwarfed, intensely red and sweet fruit.
Odd maniocs have grown in clumps the
size of saplings. Nearly all the “sweet-buks”
have disappeared, though I have occasion-
ally met them grown into a sort of yam.
Ali other vegetables have vanished, as also
most of the flowers. Some of the latter,
how r ever, have adapted themselves to en-
vironment and thrive, though in color and
form quite different from what they were
20 years ago.

“Black Tracker”: The Kangaroo Island
reserve, known as Flinders Chase, promises
to exceed Professor Wood Jones’s expec-
tations. The protected ’possums and wal-
labies have multiplied so rapidly that the
advisory committee proposes that certain
months be declared open, so that their
numbers may be reduced. It has also been
suggested that a charge should be made for
licenses or a royalty placed on all skins
marketed, the proceeds to go towards the
upkeep of the Chase. Incidentally, the
Tasmanian black ’possums, which were in
danger of being exterminated, are doing
famously on the island, and later on
will be the source of much wealth.

“Bill Bowyang”: When eocoanuts were
thriving on the Daintree River (N.Q.) 30
years back, damage to the trees came from
an unexpected quarter. Binghi took a fancy
to cocoanut meat, and in order to make the
climbing as easy as possible cut steps into
the trees to reach the nuts. The trees did
not bear after being thus mutilated. When
Binghi was persuaded to stop the practice
bush-fires damaged many of them. One
grower adopted a unique method of prevent-
ing this destruction. He planted sweet-
potatoes around the young trees, and the
vines checked the advance of the flames.
“Wandi”: Ulgundhi Island, one of the
90 specks in the Clarence River, is an
aboriginal farming settlement, where Black
Brother has shown, by perhaps the best
example in N. S. Wales, what he is capable
of under proper management. The island
is provided with a school, under a white
teacher, for the black children. The farms
produce sugarcane, beans, maize and pota-
toes. In one year the abo. growers sold over
£50(1 worth of cane, whilst the school, in
competition with all the district schools,
obtained first prize for the best display of
work and products at the Lower Clarence
Agricultural Society’s show. The children
were quick at learning, and after school
were steady and intelligent workers.
“Tamornie”: Dwellers in the south can
form little idea of the countless millions of
flying-foxes in the jungles of northern Aus-
tralia and in the Pacific Islands. I was
camped on a creek between Marakai station,
on the Adelaide River, and Batchelor (N.T.)
when I saw a flight travelling inland from
the coastal mangrove swamps, where they
spend the breeding season, to the jungles
where the wild-figs were fruiting. At 4.30
p.m. the vanguard passed overhead, and
from tlnm fill it became too dark to see them
a stream of the villains about 20 yards
wide, followed the course of the creek. In
three minutes I counted 2040 and this was
only a small proportion of those that passed,
since I could not count across the width
of the flight. My estimate is that over
half a million passed in three hours. Further
along the creek the blacks were killing
them with throwing-sticks, and there was
a great feast that night. To a white man
the thought of eating a flying-fox is repul-
sive. but absolute necessity compelling me
to sample them on one occasion, I must
admit that the flesh made fair eating. An
old New Guinea trader told me that he often
ate them, after burial in dry* sand for 24
hours had caused the musky odor to dis-
appear.

“Momokeni”: The white jacky-winter
(B. 28/4/’27) is surely an albino. Albinism
occurs occasionally in birds, beasts and
humans, and has been fixed by selective
breeding in animals such as white mice.
White sparrows, white rooks and white wag-
tails are sometimes reported in local papers,
but the only case of albinism in birds 1
ever saw was a white rook. It had a bad
time, being driven away from the parental
rookery by angry black brethren.

“6G.Y.”: I doubt if many dogs can sur-
pass in intelligence an old kelpie I came
across in the Ballina (N.S.W.) district re-
cently. A friend driving a grey Dodge car
called at the place where I was working and
took the boss off for a week-end holiday.
When they started I had to grab the old dog
and tie him up to prevent him following.
Next, morning when I let him loose he ran
to the side of the road, a popular one for
tourists, and watched the cars that went by.
Twenty or thirty motors of various makes
hummed past, but he took little notice of
them. Then a grey Dodge whizzed along. Old
Laddie gave a yelp and raced after it, man-
aging to keei) it just in sight for over a
mile. It then pulled up at a refreshment-
room. As the passengers got out he smelt
each one separately, looked carefully into
the front and back seats of the car. and.
having satisfied himself that it was not the
one his boss went away in, trotted slowly
home.

“Spadger”: When were pintpots or pan-
nikins first used in Australia? My father
remembers a shearing in the early ’seventies
when the men were provided with crockery
basins in which to drink their post-and-rail.
“Ledraw”: “Sawbones”: (R. 21/4/’27)
may be right in saying that want of vita-
mines causes Rarcoo rot, but how does he
account for this? On a station on the Barwon
we all had Rarcoo rot, yet the tucker w T as
first-class, with ample fresh meat, vegetables
and milk. It had been a very wet season,
and flies were troublesome. Rarcoo spew
was also prevalent.
JOHNNY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
By chance I heard some people say
“The fire went through the spur to-day.”
This information called a pause
Upon the daily round because
About a week before this flare
I met a kookaburra there.
He had deep laughter in his eyes
And he was fearless, friendly, wise.
Once I was overjoyed to find
A little dish of bacon rind,
lie met me with it by the fence
And his excitement was intense.
He ate my imitation worms
Most gratefully, but missed the squirms.
Some folk may doubt that, but I know,
We understood each other so!
That he was married I had proof
Although his people kept aloof.
I know 7 , for oft his features took
That puzzled, married sort of look.
His lady trusted her home-tree
More than she ever trusted me.
And when they said the fire was through
It seemed the only thing to do
To take a car that very night
And see if Johnny was all right
And in the blackened copse we shared
To ask him how the twins had fared.
But though it seemed I really should
1 feared it mightn’t do much good.
Alas! the post he laughed upon.
The stumps and woodshed all are gone;
My house and his delightful crib
Have vanished like a penny squib.
I feel that something should be done,
But can’t think of a thing—not one.
The Spring is coining round and then
We may meet on the Spur again,
For, Johnny, I would love to learn
How you and yours fared in the burn.

RISK OF OLD YARDS.
“J.D.C.” : Many sheep are lost annually in
Australia from tetanus, particularly on pro-
perties where they are only a side-line. Deaths
following shearing are usually attributed to
cold weather or rough handling, but when
carefully investigated, tetanus is' often found
to be the cause. The woolslied on a small
holding is generally a kind of store-room
the rest of the year, and all the hides, skins,
dead wool, etc., are dumped there until shear-
ing comes round. The shed is then roughly
swept out, the board mopped over with a
broom and a few buckets of water —the slush
being often swept down the chutes —the sheep
are put in, and the work started. In blade
sheds the waterpots in which the shears were
dipped were often a source of infection, as
they were rarely changed until they sprang
a leak, and the accumulation of filth became
an ideal medium for the culture of tetanus
and other germs. In these circumstances the
smallest cut is dangerous, and even contact
with the earth in the counting-out pens may
result in infection.
The whole floor of the shed should be
scoured with strong disinfectant, including
lower parts of walls and fences, and the
counting-out pens, branding-race, etc., treated
with quicklime. The older the shed and
yards the greater the risk, as the mixed dust
and manure, generally inches deep, forms a
perfect hotbed for the development of wogs.
The incubating period of tetanus may extend
to three weeks, and as the sheep by then are
back in their paddocks and probably doing
well, deaths are credited to anthrax or poison
weeds.
The danger of old yards is now so generally
realised on most large holdings that tem-
porary structures are used for lamb-marking;
but as this system cannot apply to woolsheds,
thorough disinfection is the only alternative.
THE JUMBUCIv’S FEET.
“T.J.” : “A sheep is as old as its legs,"
meaning that a ewe eight years old if sound
on her pins is a more valuable animal than
a ewe of six that is shaky about the shoul-
ders or knuckles. It is, above all, necessary
to keep the jumbuck's toes trimmed. Young
sheep require • very little attention in this
respect, but after a jumbuck passes his
fourth year his hooves are liable to grow
long and ungainly. This is generally true
of sheep in plain country, and especially
true of those on blacksoil plains. In wet
weather, too, the hooves seem to spread more
than in dry. Unless the animal is attended
to when his toes begin to get out of shape,
lie is liable to go lame and lose condition
and is much more likely to succumb during a
dry spell. Naturally, his earning-powers are
diminished in every respect, even as regards
wool. All this when a few seconds’ work
with knife or toe-cutting pliers would set
matters right.
In parts of N. S. Wales during last
winter and spring footrot was prevalent and
caused considerable loss. Sheep with long
or misshapen hooves are the most likely to
contract this complaint. As soon as foot-
rot is noticed the sheep should be yarded.
Their feet should be carefully trimmed and,
whenever practicable, the rot cut out. Then
the animals should be walked through a
solution of bluestone (bluestone dissolves
more readily in hot than in cold water).
A strong wooden trough is a good receptacle
for the solution. This should be built the
length of the race, and fitted into a trench
so that its top is level with the ground sur-
face. The solution must be kept at such a
level as to completely cover the sheep’s
hooves. They should be then turned out
in the driest paddock available, and in about
a week’s time put through the solution again.
On the second occasion very little trimming
can be done, as the bluestone makes the
hooves hard and dry and difficult to cut.
The treatment outlined above is not infal-
lible ; unfortunately, no treatment is. In
fact, if the disease has reached such an
advanced stage that it breaks out above the
hooves, i.e., in the animal’s flesh, before the
fight begins, chances of success are pretty
poor.
CONCRETE ON THE FARM.
“Billy Ballong”: We have used concrete
fence-posts on the Murchison (W.A.) for
many years with every success. Besides
being fireproof they are especially service-
able where fences cross rivers. Not only
do we use concrete for posts, but all our
tank-stands and verandah-posts are made of
this material, and the first cost is the last.
Drinking-troughs of concrete are also a suc-
cess, while concreting the approaches to the
troughs three feet on either side prevents
thirsty sheep making a quagmire round the
place and saves many a lamb. Without this
help lambs often cannot reach the water owing
to the bog.
TIMBER FOR FENCING.
“F.H.R.” : Thirty years ago N. S. Wales
cockies seemed to think that the first fence
they put round their lands would last for
ever, so they killed out all their useful timber.
Nowadays most of them leave a fair sprink-
ling of suitable trees along the lines of
existing fences. What has always made me
wild is the ringing and suckering of timber-
on portions of land that would never grow
grass. Ringing itself is a good idea if you
want to go in for reafforestation. For in-
stance, one stringybark, however unsuitable
itself for timber, will, after ringing, throw
out a nest of suckers. Should these be left
to grow for a few years and then culled out,
at least three good straight sticks will be
the result, and in a matter of 15 to 20 years
these will be good, well-seasoned timber
for fencing. Iron posts must nearly always
be carted over country that is innocent of
roads, while the country will produce the
timber on the spot.
RESTORING BANANA BAND.
“Hop Scrub”: The banana is a vor-
acious feeder and prefers soils of
high humus content; hence the grow-
ing and turning under of the velvet and
Mauritius bean and pigeon pea. To bring
back exhausted banana land into profitable
production it has boon found that applications
of potash, super, and nitrogenous manures
increase the total weight of crop consider-
ably, though it has little effect on the number
of hands in the bunch. The banana demands
a heavy percentage of potash and the re-
lative weights of the mixture that gave the
best results in tests at Buderim were potash
160, phosphoric acid 80, and nitrogen 40.
AIDS TO POULTRY-KEEPING.
“Practical”: Give your chicks green feed
of some kind every day. As a green feed
in summer, lucerne stands alone. But chaff
it up when it is young and succulent ; don’t
allow it to get woody.
Separate the sexes as soon as you are able
to distinguish them.
If you have any liens setting, don't forget
to dust them well with insectibane; at the
same time give the nest a good sprinkling.
(cleanliness is essential to success.
Keep your chicks busy. If you have small
runs, dig them over often. Apart from
offering the chicks an incentive to scratch
harder, this keeps the ground sweet and fresh.
Never coddle your chicks. Grow them
under good, clean, healthy conditions. Feed
them well on sound, first-quality food, and
wean them off heated brooders as soon as
growth and weather conditions will permit.
When using artificially-heated brooders for
rearing your early chicks, be very careful
to maintain an even temperature, and as
nearly correct as possible for the age and
development of the chicks. F'or the first
few days about 90 deg. is right, reducing
it a few degrees every few days, having in
view at all times weather conditions, pro-
gress of feathering and the number of chicks
being brooded.
When you have hens setting on eggs never
put the food or drinking-water near enough
for her to reach without coming off the
nest. It is best to place both a short dis-
tance away to ensure her leaving the nest
to obtain it. Thereby you oblige her to take
a certain amount of exercise and keep her
in condition. It also very often helps to
prevent fouling the nest, which is both
harmful and objectionable.
WOOLLY APHIS.
“Poncirus”: Any fat or oil will kill woolly
aphis—provided it reaches the pest. The
covering is the aphides’ protection. Com-
mercially, oil or tobacco-extract sprays are
used, but good kills depend on the force
from the spray-pump and the extent the
woolly covering is blown away and the oil
or other spray allowed to get in its work.
The parasite Aphelinus mali, which has
recently been introduced to N.S.W. from
Maoriland, is death to the woolly pest.
Aphelinus is a minute wasp that makes its
home inside the aphis during part of its
existence, eating its innards, departing as a
mature wasp, and leaving the apliis shell
sucked dry. Our native parasites, in the
form of ladybirds, sometimes get to work and
clean up both the aphis and the parasite.
If apple-trees are near the garden tap, try
blowing the pest off with the hose. It often
succeeds quite well.
GRASS-SEEDS—PREVENT ’EM !
“Spike”: “ J.D.C.’s” illuminative survey
of the grass-seed problem (B. 5/5/’27) is
of great value to the sheep-man who is in
the business in a small way. But under
existing awards the cost for handling, dip-
ping and treating sheep in large numbers
in the eradication of the nuisance would be
prohibitive. Prevention, besides being better,
in this instance is far cheaper than cure.
The main point is to shear early. And the
better the season the earlier the shearing.
Few sheep-men these days are without
a mob of cattle —generally young steers
picked up at a couple of pounds per head —
which, besides keeping down the rank feed,
useless for sheep, are growing into money
while the boss sleeps. Turned into paddocks
which are seeding early, the cattle knock
out a lot of seed, or else trample down the
long grass, so that the valuable portions of
the sheep’s fleece cannot come in contact
with the seed. The belly-wool, shanks and
wigs are usually seedy in any good season,
and as the sheep come under individual
notice at shearing, grass-seed in the eye can
be instantly detected and treated, while the
shanks are always trimmed.
No doubt grass-seed causes loss to the
wool-grower, but he is fortunate in that a
great deal of the seed of Australian natural
grasses comes out in the scouring. The
fact that it takes bushels of this class of
seed to frighten oversea wool-buyers was
apparent during 1922. I shore 2600 come-
back lioggits in the November of that year.
They carried 15 months’ wool which so
bristled with seed that the animals resembled
porcupines. Sold in February, 1923, the
wool, although very tender, returned an
average of 24d. per lb. Of course it carried
no Bathurst-burr.
“SEEDY” SHEEP.
“Almanac”: Beware of lambs or stores
from corkscrew-grass country ! Any experi-
enced livestock-buyer, purchasing for slaugh-
tering, will generally refrain from bidding
for woollies which he knows to come from
such country, or will offer a very low price.
At Flemington abattoirs (Vic.) I have seen
“seed lambs” slaughtered by the hundred, only
to be rejected by the grader. The flesh on
the legs, loins and belly of some of these has
been literally covered with corkscrew. These
rejects, although otherwise prime quality,
are sent to the meat market, usually to make
about half (or less) of what they would be
worth were they free of the curse. Mostly
they are bought by “choppers,” and your
delectable sausage’s flavor may be enhanced
(or otherwise) by the extra ingredient, cork-
screw.
In recent years the corkscrewed animal
has been more numerous, and I’m wondering
if the buying of these as stores is spreading
the curse.
BARLEY GRASS.
“Saaedi” : I’m locking horns with “J.D.C.”
when he says (B. 5/5/’27) that barley-grass
is not nearly as bad in effect as corkscrew,
spear-grass and wire-grass. I bought a mob
of 500 hoggets once. They were twelve
months old, but only a little larger than
mice. “Did they all lose tlreir mothers as
babies?” I asked. “No, barley-grass,” the
seller replied, and further added that they
were the survivors of a mob of 1000. Another
lot of sheep I bought oft barley-grass country
lost 50 per cent, of their wool. The only
way to combat this grass is to stack about
10 sheep to the acre on it when it is growing :
and even then, in a good season, it will
probably beat the jumbucks, as it is a won-
derfully quick grower. When green it is good
fattening, and it is not until the stalk dies
and the bar tied seed forms that it becomes
dangerous.
SUBTERRANEANCLOVER.
“Jaymack”: “8.T.” (B. 5/5/’27) states
that this plant was discovered at Mt. Barker
(S.A.). I don’t know what date it was dis-
covered there, but I do know that 40 years
ago the late David Mitchell (father of Dame
Nellie Melba) imported a consignment of
strawberry clover seed from Holland to sow
a 200-acre swamp on his Fancourt estate
near Camperdown (Vic.). Within a year
or so there appeared an alien clover in this
swamp area. The interloper did not do well
in the swamp, but upon the edges of the
swamp, comprising stony volcanic rises, it
throve amazingly. It was subterranean
clover (Trifolium subicrranium).
In spreading to the adjacent stony rises
it worked wonders. Land lying unselected
and over which the Western pioneers passed
to go further west it transformed into pros-
perous dairy farms. “Sub.” has ousted the
thistles and bracken, and incidentally made
it possible to abolish the rabbits and myriads
of snakes which swarmed there, and it would
be a fortunate cow-cocky who could to-day
purchase this hitherto wilderness for £4O
per acre. Such is the fame of this plant that
many years ago the Hampden Shire Council
(in which the area in question is situated)
was forced to frame a special by-law prohibit-
ing the sweeping of its roads —a damaging
practice followed by outsiders to secure the
seeds of this wonderful fodder-plant.
It is now spread over the greater part of
Victoria, but does best in the cooler districts.
It makes early autumn growth, but the sum-
mer sun is not to its liking.
COFFEE IN QUEENSLAND.
“W.P.D.” : In the year 1924-25, 2,605,240
pounds of coffee was imported from overseas.
The value of this, at Is. per lb., was
£130,262, which was sent out of Australia,
and gave employment to foreign labor.
Queensland ought to capture the bulk of that
trade. It can and should be done.
At the beginning of this century there
were 12 or 15 coffee plantations between
Buderiirt in the south and Cairns in the north.
A couple are all that remain. Yet nowhere
in the world does the plant flourish better
or give higher returns ; many instances are
known of 15cwt. per acre being gathered.
The difficulty of obtaining labor during the
picking season might be overcome by a
system of co-operation among small planters,
especially those who have a family of children
who could help at the harvesting. That
finished, the year’s work on two or three
acres is very light. The shrub will grow
well and bear abundantly in any moderately
fertile land out of reach of severe frost where
there is an annual average rainfall of 38
to 40 inches. Most newly opened scrub land,
if undulating and naturally drained, is very
suitable. Farmers would And coffee an excel-
lent and profitable side-line; a few hundred
trees up to two or three acres could be
easily tended, and the remuneration would be
'encouraging. Reckoning the yield at a
moderate 10001 b. per acre, the gross return
would be £29 3s. 4d. The finished beans
should be worth Is. per lb., which would give
£5O, from which must be deducted the loss
of weight of the parchment skin, about 18
per cent., and the cost of hulling, the two
items aggregating about £l3 10s., leaving
£36 10s. per acre net to the grower. With a
well-considered system of co-operation among
small growers and efficient arrangements for
marketing, there is no reason why the indus-
try cannot be revived and made a much
bigger thing than ever it was before.
COMPETITION WITH ARGENTINA.
“Shorthorn”: Australian and Maoriland
farmers read so much of the Argentine
and its great rivalry to us in beef-producing
that we are apt to throw in the sponge too
readily. It should be always remembered
that the chilled beef which commands such
a fine price in London comes only from
the alfalfa belt, 20,000,000 acres. In this
area the cattle are all high grade, 90 per
cent, shorthorns. Breeding for many years
has been conducted on scientific lines. And
as in Australia the cattle are sent direct
from paddock to abattoir.
Most of the beef goes to market at the
age of two to two and a half years. Few
cattle are kept four years. This system of
beef marketing approaches that of Maoriland
with its young Canterbury lamb. There are
three chief classes of Argentine beef cattle —
chilled, frozen and canned. Britain takes
the best, which is the chilled; Belgium. Italy
and France take the frozen. Why should we
not attempt to open up these Continental
markets for our frozen meat?
England would naturally prefer to get her
chilled meat from her dominions; but chilled
meat must reach the consumer within 40
days of slaughter, and while Argentine can
do this, we in Australia and M.L. take 50
days. The establishment of abattoirs again
in Northern Australia and a faster steam-
ship service would get over the difficulty.
But who will supply them without tangible
guarantee against the recurrence of suicidal
strikes?
STILL MORE WOOL-PACKS.
“Trepex”: Yet another wool-pack is being
tested with a view to saving the vegetable-
fibre nuisance in the old jute affair. Brad-
ford must be in deadly earnest over the
half-million pounds a year which it claims
the jute thread costs it. Or is it that keen
business men scent a possibility of making
money out of the scare? Twenty wool-
brokers, representative of Australia and
John Bull's land, were invited to inspect a new
wool container constructed of very fine wire
wrapped in paper. Opinions differed, which
isn’t wonderful. Woolgrowers will have to
be satisfied over several points before they
look into the thing seriously. What will
be the cost? Will they stand the wear and
tear of land transport? What will be their
facilities for handling? Will they be made
to fit the thousands of wool-presses in use
throughout the country? And, after all. how
far is this vegetable fibre nuisance charge-
able to Australia? We have, at least, been
(Continued on page 31.)

educated past the point of using binder
twine and such-like horrors to sew our
bales. Other countries haven’t, and no doubt
we get some of the kicks that are coming
in consequence.
Another important point is: Can the
things be made in Australia? Any change
from the existing arrangements should be
in favor of a local product.
IMPROVING CARRYING CAPACITY.
“T.J.” : In N.S.W. the increase in sheep
numbers due to good seasons and the limi-
tation of grazing areas due to closer settle-
ment bring to the fore the need to improve
the carrying capacity of pastoral properties.
Undoubtedly many properties are now
giving the best returns possible. Again, in
the Western division the rainfall is, in most
eases, so low that it would never pay to
improve the land to its fullest capacity. But
in average sheep country—land reckoned a
sheep to one or two acres —-millions of
pounds could be spent very profitably. It
goes without saying that rabbit destruction
is of fii»st importance. It can be claimed
with confidence that when good country is
cleared of rabbits the carrying capacity is
increased by a third. This will show a
very fine return, in most cases from 50 to
100 per cent, on the money invested.
That done, the stations must be kept well
subdivided to give good results. A paddock
of 1000 acres carrying 500 sheep will do
better than a 2000-acre area of similar coun-
try carrying 1000 sheep. This is due to the
fact that the jumbucks in the larger enclosure
travel further in a day, on the average, and
so per head destroy more feed and require
more feed than the sheep in the smaller pad-
dock. Possibly 500 sheep is the ideal number
for any enclosed area of fair country.
The water problem is not so acute as it
was years ago, owing to the great increase
in artesian and sub-artesian bores, but much
remains to be done. Where practicable sheep
should not. have to travel more than a mile
and a half to water.
Some graziers make the mistake of over-
crowding paddocks that carry a heavy coat
of grass. All grasses should be given a
chance to seed, and light stocking is the
best policy in the long run. In years to
come artificial grasses may be used to in-
crease the carrying capacity of our sheep-
walks, but the native grasses over much of
N.S.W. are ideal for sheep raising. The
main thing at present is to see that the
native grasses get the best possible chance.
FRUIT-TREES AND RUSTY NAILS.
“Poncirus”: “Pick” tells us (B. 5/5/’27)
of non-bearing fruit-trees that have been
made fruitful by driving iron nails and
bolts into them. There is no virtue in the
rusty nail. Often non-bearing fruit-trees
are extra vigorous, and while putting on
vegetative growth are out of stride with the
bearing habit. What happens when a spike
is driven into a tree is that the sap is
diverted to heal the wound, the tree is
weakened and growth checked, and a bal-
ance is reached that induces cropping. All
fruit-trees go through the above stages.
First, there is the young, vigorous stage;
second, a steadying stage (that is, a slower
flowing of the sap) ; finally, the bearing
stage, the balance between root and top that
is desired.
There are fruit-trees that never crop sat-
isfactorily no matter what is done. This is
a matter of breed, and can only be rectified
by the selection of buds or grafts from
proved trees of bearing habits —that is, “bud
selection” from pedigree trees. And make
no mistake, there are pedigree fruit-trees
just the same as there are pedigree bulls.
LAMB-MARKING RECORDS.
“J.D.C.”: "Taharangi” (B. 2S/4/’27)
doubts whether lambs can be satisfactorily
marked at the rate of 1000 per hour. Well,
for 15 years I had to mark about 60
thousand lambs per annum, and occasionally
attained the rate mentioned. A few were my
own, but most belonged to other properties,
and the work w T as considered satisfactory. In
these days of closer settlement few men get
much practice and have no chance to become
expert, but along the Lachlan in the ’nineties
big mobs were the rule, and the knife-man
had to know his job. There is nothing to
prevent an expert attaining the speed referred
to and still doing good work.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Dundoo": “Glenfield” (B. 5/5/’27)
tells us that the way to keep a
horses’s shoulders O.K. is to see that
the collar is the right size. But often
the right size is not available, and then the
bran-bag fitted under a slightly oversize collar
makes it right. If a horse has a sore shoulder
cut a hole in the bag to correspond with the
sore. Don’t cut the collar. Another thing
to help towards fewer sore shoulders is the
dandy-brush. Keep the shoulders and collar
♦•lean. A good brush-down in the morning is
almost as good as a feed. Feed oats, crushed
for preference; they make a horse harder and
far less likely to get sore shoulders than one
fed with a corn or wheat mixture.
“Y. Worry”: “Ziff’s” method of storing
eats (B. 5/5/'27) belongs to the prehistoric
days. It’s a poor kind of Riverina cocky
who cannot sport a silo for his oats. Storing-
oats in bags, even if the rain and the mice
don’t get in, is wasteful and extravagant.
The oats soon begin to dribble out. and after
12 months bags worth a bob apiece are use-
less for grain again. For £5O a cocky can
erect a galvanised-iron silo to contain 500
to 600 bags, and it is practically everlasting.
“5.8. W.” : “Rene” asks (B. 5/5/’27) about
borers in fruit-trees. Usually they gft in
their deadlv work before the trouble is found.
Squirt methylated spirits into the hole in
the tree and stop up the hole with soap.
Kerosene is used in place of methylated at
times, but it is likely to do damage to young
trees. Wattle-trees are at times the breeding-
ground for borers. I believe there is not any
method of stopping them from attacking fruit-
trees.
“.Tore-bowler”: A horse T owned was a
confirmed kicker. 1 called in a vet., who
extracted a badly-decayed tooth which must
have cost the neddie almost continuous pain.
Its removal was followed by complete refor-
mation. Since then I have not known him
to kick anything- animate or inanimate.
Teeth troubles are the cause of much kick-
ing and jibbing.
“Y. Worry" : Last year motoring through
Natal (S. Africa) 1 saw hundreds of groves
of wattle ranging from a few acres to a
couple of hundred acres. Nearly a quarter-
million acres are under wattle in this one
State of the Union, and the growers are
making good profits. The trees are stripped
in the eighth year; the yield per acre is
about three tons of dried bark, which aver-
ages £ll per ton. The timber, which runs
to about 20 tons per acre, is sold as props
in the mining centres and for firewood; this
side-line returns easily £5 per acre. Experi-
ments are now being carried out to extract
vegetable dyes from the wattle.
❖ ❖ ❖
“E.S.”: The noise that the domesticated
hen makes after laying an egg is evidently
an acquired habit. Watch the truant layers
that go away in the grass on farms and
selections. They don’t make any fuss when
they want to lay, like the. house-hen, which
goes around caw-caw-caw-ing for half an
hour beforehand. Many of the nests are
so well concealed, and the hens so secret
about them, that they are never found. The
truant layers, with the instinct of wild
ancestors, become too cunning to approach
the hiding-place when watched. What is
more remarkable, they can lay a whole
clutch without cackling once. An occasional
boastful hen, after laying about 50 rods
away, cackles when she gets back to the
house. The others return unobtrusively,
looking quite innocent, as if they had merely
been seeing about some grasshoppers. Dur-
ing the sitting period, too, nearly every one
can hide her broodiness. But one fine morn-
ing she marches proudly out of the grass
with a family, and takes the little squeakers
right up to the house to be fed.
jt* * J.:
The latest report of the Vic. Government
herd test shows the Friesian in a very favor-
able light. The breed has given several re-
markable returns hitherto, but the three-
year-old Halecote Opera Girl’s leads the lot.
She returned 6491 b. butter-fat in 273 days,
a record for a heifer of that age in all breeds,
and 431 b. ahead of the previous best. She
gave 1894 gallons of milk in the 273 days,
or 6f gallons daily over the nine months.
As the old Yorkshireman said when he lit,
accidentally, on the jug of rum and milk,
“Man, what a coo!”
* v *
“X.2.X.”: The possibility of animals dis-
similar in species producing young lias been
scouted as being outside the bounds of bio-
logical reason. Yet fertile unions have been
known to occur between the bull and the
mare, and it would be hardly possible to have
two creatures belonging to species more dif-
ferent. Within recent years there has been
reported from France such a bull-mare union,
the offspring being known as a “jumart.”
The existence of such creatures, in which the
characteristics of the bovine sire generally
predominate, was reported by the English
naturalist John Loudon in the early part of
the nineteenth century. Mention also was
made of them a good deal earlier by a num-
ber of writers, amongst them the philosopher
Locke. One curious feature is that the
“jumart” is always the offspring of the bull
and the mare and never of the stallion and
the cow. The basic laws which govern the
phenomenon of reproduction between varieties
and species are so little known that it is
impossible to say which can and which can-
not reproduce.

“J.8.C.”: It took a very bad accident
to make a cherry-tree in our orchard realise
that its mission was to bear fruit. It was
20 years old, and, although it always had
a beautiful blossoming, no one had ever
seen fruit dangling from its branches. During
a violent wind-storm it w T as blown over,
although some of its roots still held firm.
The following season it had a wonderful,
crop of white cherries, and in spite of its
dissipated appearance it is still a credit

“ J.McG.” : ‘Before South Aus. became
noted for its merinoes (I refer to the long-
ago days of shepherding), a percentage of
the lambs had one or two fleshy dumb-
bells on their necks. Some of the older sheep
had them, too, but the things usually got
cut off at shearing time. If the bells escaped
the shears they grew, and had hair on instead
of wool. I have not seen a sheep or lamb
so adorned for more than 50 years. At the
time of which I write all sheep were shep-
herded and many of them had real bells
strapped on to scare the dingoes at night
and warn the shepherd. Had the wearing
of these bells anything to do with the growth
of the dumb-bells? I am minded of Jacob
of Biblical history, who placed colored rods
before the sheep at their watering-place and
soon had a multitude of spotted sheep.
“Lammermoor” : North Queensland cattle-
men are facing a bleaker prospect than usual.
The big Burdekin meatworks, which begin
operations early in May, is offering only
17s. a hundred for first-quality beef. A
6001 b. bullock at 17s. per 1001 b. will return
the grower 70s. to 755., according to the
amount of transport costs to be deducted.
There is no reduction in production costs,
and coming on top of the drought losses
the drop is a serious one. Small wonder
a cattleman at the meeting of Dalrymple
Shire Council, at the Towers, said recently
it would pay better to raise rabbits!
“Prickly Jack”: The myall is rapidly suc-
cumbing to the increasing, and sometimes
wanton, demands on it for fodder, firewood
and fencing material. This picturesque and
useful tree takes considerably longer to reach
maturity than most of our indigenous vege-
tation. and on the sheep-runs where new
growth is most needed the seedlings are
eaten off as soon as they appear above
ground. Some lusty young myalls may occa-
sionally be seen in horse,-paddocks, but with
the increasing use of the motor-car even
tliese sanctuaries are being invaded by stud
rams and killers.

momentarily to an electrical circuit, and,
nichrome wire being the heating element
used in electrical heaters, it gets hot enough
to just sizzle through the wool, enabling the
entire fleece to be lifted off without damage
and in a fraction of the time usually taken,
while the jurnbuck walks off to grow’ another
one. Its advantages are apparent. I am

Williams saturated lather
in a stick with a non-slip holderi
Men want two things above all others in shaving
sticks. First: the right kind of lather; and,
second: a holder in which the soap can’t work
loose. Williams gives you both. The soap
works up into a quick, rich lather that bulks
large on the face. The razor just glides
through the beaten bristles.
The holder grips the stick so that slipping is
impossible. When a reload is necessary, the
wafer of soap comes out easily and surely, and
can be placed on top of the new reload. Buy

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE great day had come!
Young Fosket, master, crew and owner
of the yacht Hermit, awoke with a
start and found his tiny cabin tilled with
bright morning light. At almost the same
instant he sat bolt upright in his bunk and
tixed his eyes, which ivere opened unnatu-
rally wide, upon the cabin clock. Then he
sprang out of the bunk in a fever of excite-
ment. He dressed hastily, jumped up on
deck, and hauled to the truck of each mast
i hoist of brand-new bunting that had been
Pent to the halyards overnight. The flags
Hew out gaily. But now came a prouder
moment. With eager, trembling hands he
took up a large roll of blue bunting; “made
up for hoisting,” it was the size of a sun-
downer’s swag. In a minute it was hoisted
between the two masts, and bellying in the
wind boldly displayed, in red lettering, the
legend: “I’m sailing round the world alone. ’
After breakfast, when all was ship-shape,
lie cast off from the little wharf in Lavender
Kay and dived into the cockpit to turn over
the spick-and-span engine. As he took the
helm he noticed that the little hatch of the
forepeak was open, but that he could batten
down at sea. All clear now! lie steered
down the harbor to his rendezvous, a buoy
in Neutral Bay, whence, at the stroke, or
rather, gunfire of noon he was to leave and
circumnavigate the globe. The passing ferry-
steamers all developed a sharp list towards
him as their passengers stampeded for a
sight of the Hermit.
“Hoop! Ray! Ray! Ray!” He felt sick
with delight. A panting launch overtook
him, and his chest swelled proudly beneath
his uniform jacket. The Press ! M hen he
rounded Admiralty House a flotilla of small
craft and a Manly ferry-steamer—The
Flagship—awaited him. All there to see
him off, to follow him to sea. It*was won-
derful ! And from each Australian port
that he visited he was going to be sent
off in this magnificent, this princely man-
ner. It had all been arranged. They were
going to fire a starting-gun, and the moment
of his departure was to be telegraphed to
the Sydney newspaper that had promoted
the voyage. The exact moment! It was
most important. People were betting on
his time between ports !
He struck imposing attitudes, heroic pos-
tures as he stood at his wheel, and from
time to time he raised his hand to the vizor
of his badge-cap in graceful salute.
“Good boy, Sinbad 1” a familiar voice
shouted. To all Sydney motor-yachtsmen
the master and owner of the Hermit was
known as Sinbad. “Hooray! Coo-ee!”
chorused the crowd.
Sinbad had no trouble tying up. He had
only to shut off his engine; there was almost j
a struggle for the honor of reeving his
painter through the eyebolt of the buoy.
Men from the committee boat came aboard
smelling of whisky; flasks and bottles were
produced. A glass was thrust into his hand,
clinked, was emptied and refilled. His right
hand was grasped and shaken until it was be-
numbed ; then at last a megaphone from the
starter’s boat brayed, warningly:
“All off the Hermit!”
Sinbad was dishevelled, drunk, and very
happy. He started the engine and waited
out of sight below with his hand on the
lever. “Bang!” went the starting-gun.
The answering roar from the crowd burst
upon him as he clambered out of the cock-
pit and ran aft to the wheel on unsteady
feet. Down the harbor went Hermit and
escorting fleet. One after another small
craft fell off and headed for home. Few
followed through the Heads. Soon only
the flagship was in sight. He steered to
the southward. Fainter and fainter came
“A li-fawn theo-shun wave,” and then,
ceased. He looked astern. Tlie flagship
was gone. He was at sea —alone. He hauled
down his flags, made sail, shut off the engine
and, intoxicated by the excitement of his
departure, by the glow of drink within him,
and by the romantic and adventurous pros-
pect that lay before him, he sang joyfully
as the yacht bounded over the sparkling
swell. All at once the chanty was strangled
on his lips; his eyes big with astonishment
were fixed upon tlie little forepeak hatch.
He staggered helplessly against the wheel.
A man’s head, a red head, had popped out
of the hatch with the startling suddenness
of a jack-in-the-box. “Blime, I'm fair
roasted •!” it remarked, wiping its streaming
forehead with a tattered sleeve. A leg-
encased in frayed trousers was thrown over
the coaming and the, stowaway scrambled
on deck. Sinbad didn’t like the look of his
unwelcome passenger—no, not at all.
“Here!” he broke out, “what’s this? D you
know I’m supposed to be sailing round the
world by myself? On my own ? Big wager,
too! You can’t stay here! You've spoilt
it all, you have!’’ He went on, his voice
rising until his tone was almost tearful:
“And now. I s’pose I'll have to turn back,”
he almost concluded, “and hand you over
to the police.” But he thought better of it.
The stowaway set his chin forward trucu-
lently and regarded the yachtsman with
narrowed eyes, then he made a contemptuous
grimace, relit Ids flaccid cigarette and flipped
the dead match into Sin bad’s face.
Sinbad’s head jerked back involuntarily
and into it spun these thoughts: “What a
nasty brute! 1 can’t turn back, though.
I’ve just got to carry on. It would mess up
everything—besides lie wouldn’t let me, the
big bully! But I’ll tip the wink to the
police in Melbourne as soon as we get there
if he doesn’t go ashore. .Mustn’t have any
publicity, though—no delay—no, I’ll have to
think what to do. But in the meantime
I’ll have to be tactful. Might be dangerous.”
Aloud he asked in a timid voice: "What’s
your name, brother?”
“Bluey,” casually replied the stowaway.
“What’s yours?”
“Sinbad,” answered the young master and
owner, and instantly bit his tongue in
chagrin. Shouldn’t he have said Captain
Fosket? The paper always referred to him
as “captain.” After all, wasn’t he a ship-
master? To cover his confusion, he asked:
“Can you cook?”
“My oath, Joe!” exclaimed the stowaway,
“(food idea, boy!” and without another word
Bluey dived into the cabin, whence arose
instantly a purposeful clatter, and later,
tempting vapors. Bye-and-bye a voice from
below called cheerfully: “Come ’n’ get a
bit of tucker.”
After the meal, Sinbad took up the morn-
ing’s papei'— —the sheet that stood sponsor to
his voyage—which until that moment had
not been opened. lie read of the prepara-
tions for his departure, of the expressed hope
that “our heroic navigator will be given a
rousing send-off,” and then drowsily began
to skip from one paragraph to another. The
stimulus of his numei'ous drams was waning
rapidly and he was just beginning to nod
when his attention was held by a photograph.
WASTING VALUABLE LAND.
THE COCKY: “ Yairs, diggin’ the dam’ rabbits out again!"
THE N EWCHUM: “ Wouldn’t it be cheaper to build hutches for them, sir, than to have
all these holes in the ground?”
He read the description beneath it and began
to glance furtively at his companion round
the edge of the paper. “Red hair,” he
thought, “scar on temple, tattooed wrist; of
course he’s the man ! Why even his clothes
are described.” And before he knew what
he was saying, he exclaimed: “Isn’t your
name Pugnell?”
Across the man’s face flashed a swift
expression of alarm, but so brief was its
duration that if Sinbad had not been watch-
ing closely he w r ould have missed it alto-
gether. Coolly the stranger reached over
and took the paper. He read,. with a blank
countenance, making no disclaimer. Sinbad
was emboldened to ask: “How did you come
aboard my craft?”
“The Johns ’ad been after me fer a week.
I got as far as McMahon’s Point when they
got on me tracks again. I seen that hatch
open last night, so I ducked down the wharf
an’ hopped aboard. It was a good possy.
That’s all.” He stared at Sinbad with
fixed unblinking gaze, and added slowly. “I
reckon you’re a dinkum sort of a bloke. Play
fair with me ’n’ me ’n’ you’ll get on all right,
see? I might even go along with you on
this ’ere world tour of yours, if things don’t
look no good in Melbourne. No one would
know but what I wasn’t aboard.”
Sinbad went limp, went hot and cold;
the very air of the cabin seemed oppressive.
A criminal. A safe-breaker ! A felon flying
from justice ! Aboard his yacht!
“That settles it: he leaves my craft the
minute I get alongside in Melbourne’’ Sinbad
decided.
“Yes,” came a sudden menacing grow l. “If
i bloke acts jonnick with me I’ll alius give
him a fair spin. But if ’e rats on me —-
well ’e’d better look out fer ’isself, that’s
all I can say. 1 gutter long memory. Too
right!” He rolled a cigarette dexterously*
and after a moment remarked in a friendly
tone: “You look proper done in, cobber.
’Ave a sleep. I’ll get up on deck. I can
steer a boat, don’t you worry; not that this
packet wants much steering, as far as 1 can
see. She's bonzer, ain’t she?”
* * * *
When nearing Melbourne Bluey took a
cushion, a blanket and a book and made
himself comfortable in the roomy cockpit.
Bluey had spent much time down there. He
seemed to be very interested in the silent
engine, and Sinbad had noticed him going
over it solicitously with a piece of oily waste.
The yacht was fitted with a speaking-tube
which connected engine and wheel. By
blowing into one end a whistle sounded at
the other end. As the Hermit went up the
bay in heavy rain, Sinbad was startled by
the sudden squeak of the whistle near the
binnacle. He applied his ear to the tube
and heard the voice of his passenger: “Don’t
forget the engineer’s standin’ by, skipper.
Sing out your orders down the toobe. I’m
hot stuff on them injuns.”
The rain came down in a cold torrent,
obscuring the land; and at last in the
night, Sinbad, cheerless and unwelcomed,
came alongside St. Ivilda jetty, calling his
orders cautiously down the tube. Bluey
proved an attentive engineer. When Sinbad
had tied up the Hermit, he went aft through
the darkness and spoke once more into the
pipe.
“Now’s your chance, Bluey. The coast
is clear. Get ashore now. I’ll give you a
raincoat.”
Bluey appeared in the gloom. In the
cabin he put on the raincoat, flung a fare-
well over his shoulder, and climbed into the
night. Sinbad was scarcely able to believe
that he had so easily got rid of the stow-
away.
The rain which had never ceased for days
was still falling when the yacht left Mel-
bourne. She stole unattended seaward
beneath a gloomy sky. She got through the
heads after a severe shaking in the Rip; the
wind increased; and soon the sea was
changed into an awful desolation of angry
grey waves. Squalls charged madly out of
the horizon. The little craft behaved nobly ;
sometimes her decks were invaded by a white
seething smother, or a great wave swept her
fore and aft, but Sinbad kept saying to
himself: “This is nothing. She’ll stand lots
worse than this. She’ll stand almost any-
thing.” But thoughts that he had tried to
expel from his mind became more tenacious.
He could not overcome his loneliness; it
increased hour by hour. Night came down
and wrapped him in terror. Ilis solitude in
this tumultuous darkness became a thing un-
speakable. He longed for the sound of a
human voice as a condemned man for the
words of reprieve. If lie had a companion
it would have been a different matter, these
days of storm, of unsleeping- despair. What
was he doing alone in this awful, sleepless
desolation? What madness!
When at last, in fine weather, he reached
Port Adelaide lie was fully resolved upon
one point: that here the voyage ended. lie
would go no farther. On no consideration
would he put to sea alone. And a mate on
the Hermit! Why, one might as well look
for two kings on a single throne! It couldn't
he done!
Adelaide greeted him on a sunny day. lie
was taken to dinner; and, exacerbated by
the discomposing visions of “great ocean
tracts our brave guest will cross alone, alone
mind you, gentlemen, in his gallant craft,”
lie drank himself into a state of sullen im-
passivity. His hosts were determined that
his departure should make a gala day; and
some time before the well-advertised hour
Sinbad found the yacht surrounded by a
fleet of small craft. The demonstration
accorded him as he appeared on deck, reeling
slightly, was received with a glare of sombre,
inebriate hostility. The committee came
aboard to shake liis hand. He was enveloped
in an aura of whisky fumes that defied the
breeze.
“Five minutes to go!” They agreed.
Further talk. “Three minutes to go !”
“I’m not going. Injvui trouble,” Sinbad
said peevishly, staring at the deck in drunken
gravity. “Not going. Injun trouble.”
“What!” exclaimed the Commodore. “Not
injuii trouble? Strange. Here, Harry, nip
over to the shed and get Mac Adam. Best
man in Australia on. internal combustion
injuns is Mac”....
“No good. Too serious.” Sinbad stam-
mered and hiccupped helplessly.
Oh! why hadn’t he given some other
reason? They’d sec there was nothing wrong
with his engine in a few seconds! Fool!
“We’ll have a look till Mac. comes,” began
the Commodore.
“All visitors off the Hermit !” bawled the
official megaphone from the starter’s boat.
Half a dozen Voices shouted in clamorous
unison :
“He’s got injun trouble!” “Reckons he
can’t go !” “He’s gotta misfiring cylinder!”
“Hold on !” “Injun trouble !”
The strong breeze made gibberish of their
dissonant chorus. Angrily the starter raised
his double-barrelled gun, muzzle to the sky,
and clapped the megaphone to his mouth. lie
was going to stand no nonsense from those
fools! From the iron throat blared the
peremptory warning: “Now then, all those
visitors off the yacht! Twenty seconds to
go!”
“Hold on !” “Mac Adam’s coming !” lies
got inj”
“Bang !” The red-faced starter had fired
the gun.
Immediately on this report a strange thing
happened. From deep down under the closed
skylight of the cockpit came a sepulchral
gasp. This was followed by a mild explosive
sound like the bursting of an overcharged
seltzogene; hiss, snort, grunt; then, chug-
cliug-chuga-chug of the sweetly running-
engine as it took to itself a rhythmic beat.
Those on the yacht’s deck stared at each
other in amazement; their minds full of
exclamations, but no words upon their lips.
The megaphone rasped in the anger of
despair: “Are you fellows going to get off
that yacht?” and startled them into action.
They tumbled into their launch alongside
and cast off. The Hermit gathered way.
Sinbad, stricken with astonishment, found
himself alone at his wheel. As in a dream
he heard the cheers and saw the waving hats
and handkerchiefs. The broad doric of
Mac Adam, the mechanic, raised in answer to
an interrogative clamor came from afar:
“Weel. sae far as I can make oot frae what
ye tell me, he’d hae one new-fangled salf-
starrtin’ gear. Ye put foot on a wee deck
gadget. Sometimes it wur-rks an’ sometimes
it does not. They’re no to be deepended on.
Peersonally I hae nae time for sicli freeVoli-
ties.”
As for Sinbad, an idea, at first nebulous,
but now growing in intensity, shone through
the chaos of his mind. It was not until the
last launch had turned back that the little
whistle squeaked. He put his ear to the tube.
“By cripes!” came Bluey’s voice. “I'd ha’
been up a gum-tree if we ’adn’t got away
then. Thought I’d ’ave a go at the engine.
She started first time. Nothin’ wrong. What,
was you only pullin’ their legs?” He paused
for a reply but none came, so he continued.
“I’d ’a’ been nabbed if I stayed in Mel-
bourne, so I come on to Adelaide. A d.
looked ’ard at me when I got off the train.
I reckoned a trip round the world'll be
good fer me ’ealth. I'll work me passage,
skipper; do any sort of yakka you like.
But don’t you put back or I’ll ’ave ter get
rough, see? Go ahead! You an’ me ’ll get
on all right. Any orders?”
Sinbad laughed quietly at the sky. Then
he spoke severely into the tube: “You may
come up now. What’s this talk of turning-
back? Bring that snatch-block out of the
starboard locker. We’ll make sail now!”

Information re growing chokos. —363.
Cliokos require a good, sunny aspect and
when in growth plenty water. Almost any
soil is suitable, but advise a good quantity
of rotted manure at base when planting.
Plant when shoot is showing about four
inches of growth and place side with shoot
uppermost. Plant now and up to end of
July. Keep covered from frost.
Have given a chap (N.S.W.) a job grub-
bing and cutting up box-timber, so much
the lot, he to find all tools, etc. Must I
insure him under Workers’ Compensation
Act?— 34o.
Yes. Section 6: “Where any person enters
into a contract to clear land of stumps or
logs and the contractor actually performs
part of the work himself he shall be deemed
to be a worker.”
I have an old dinner-plate with a unique
pattern. It is branded “Cellini,” and I am
told it is valuable. Is it? —313.
Information too vague. If it is a genuine Cel-
lini metalware platter it would be worth about
£2000; but the facts you give do not suggest
that it is. Write to Tyrrells, Ltd., 26 Martin-
place, Sydney; or Miller Stokes, Margaret-
street, Sydney.
With what trees shall I beautify an
open, flat area of about two acres; some-
thing quick-groicing that would retain its
foliage for most of the year? The land is
on the Liverpool Plains. —270.
The following quick-growing evergreen
trees are recommended : Acacia elata (cedar-
wattle, Lophostemon australis (silver-box),
Cupressus lawsoniana, Ceratonia siliqua
(carob bean), Erythrina caffra (coral-tree),
E. ficifolia (scarlet flowering-gum), E. coryno-
calyx (sugar-gum), Grevillea robusta (silky-
oak), and (if you haven’t tired of it) Scliinus
molle (pepper-tree). Deciduous: Melia aze-
darach (white cedar), Platanus orientalis
(plane-tree). Any of the above are plantable
now.
Are there any frost-free places near Sydney
where tomatoes and beans could be grown

What number of settlers are on the Daw-
son Valley? Is there an opening for trades-
men—l’m a saddler? —245.
About January last 300 irrigation farms
were made available in blocks of from five
to over 20 acres at 30s. per acre p.a., and
a contiguous dry area of from 90-500 acres
at 2s. 6d. per acre p.a. At the township
of Theodore streets are laid out and all
shops, halls, boarding-houses and dwellings
are built to a plan. Electric lighting and
water are provided for. The retail shops
and other businesses there at present supply
all the wants of the district. The scheme
is being financed by the Queensland Govern-
ment. The Commissioner of Water Supply,
Brisbane, will supply fuller details.
Where can J. H. M. Abbott’s “Letters

gentleman out with a piece of wire and drop
into his tunnel a few spots of kerosene-
emulsified with rain-water and soft-soap.
When the borers are working underground on
the roots, as they so often are in peaches and
plums, a soil fumigant is necessary. The
best is paradicholorobenzene; use t to loz.
of the crystals per tree. Scrape a circular
trench around the tree one inch deep, two
inches away from the butt of the tree, and
cover the crystals over with loose soil. This

ment is applied in spring.—Hop Scrub.
238. —For several years, growing leaf for
my own use, I found that when simply cured
it had very little flavor. Discarding some
inferior leaves I threw them in a box where
there chanced to be a broken Havana cigar.
Months later I hunted up the rejected leaves
to find them now delicious and pungent with
the Havana aroma. Later I found that the
true curing of tobacco is not in its drying,
but the leaving it in bundles on floors fdr
long periods. There it _ generates its own
ferments, or it may—as in my experiment—
be inoculated by a strange one. The leaf,
cured, matured and flavored, is moistened
and pressed into cakes; but you must bake
the neAvly-pressed leaf sufficiently to kill all
germ life.—Hawkesbury.
134. —Re “Hush-hush” towers. The effective
barring of the Straits of Dover against Ger-
man submarines was very difficult; cruisers,
destroyers, trawlers and drifters were con-
stantly driven in by bad weather, and were
very unsteady gun- and lookout-platforms at
any time. The concrete towers were designed
to be sunk at intervals across the 21 miles
of straits for use as gun-towers and lookout-
stations ; also as anchorages for anti-sub-
marine nets. They would have released a
large number of small craft for duty else-
where and been more efficient than ships.—

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
It is not only bipeds who benefit from a
change in the country. When raced in
Sydney for a season or two Land of Leisure,
a big brown gelding by imported Shadowland
—Rosedell. had the reputation of being a
speedy squib. He failed repeatedly in third-
class company, turning it up when tackled,
as a rule. Bought for the Newcastle district
lie came under the care of veteran trainer .J.
Chambers, for whom, in process of time, he
did so well that he was brought back to the
city last week, having been nominated for the
Flying Handicap at Randwick. Ilis party
backed him at 10 to 1 and better, but most
people neglected him with scorn. Consider-
ably astonished were they, and not a little
indignant, when they saw the despised animal
cut down the pacemaking Cadenza (12 to
1) and go on to win by a couple of lengths
in lmin. lljsec. for the six furlongs—time
he never got within seconds of last season.
Cadenza was clear of the third horse, Boaster
(8 to 1) , and would have been a good thing
with Land of Leisure away. Punters’ feel-
ings were not improved by the coming to
light of Sweet Sappho (14 to 1), hitherto
reckoned a jade, in Tattersall’s Stakes; nor
did many of them back Lucy Thrice (10 to
1) in the Winter Stakes, for which £750 was
hung up by Tattersall’s Club. Some of the
sporting scribes wrote that the daughter of
Thrice and Glenluce was lucky to beat
Tibbie (9 to 2), and allege that Tooliey went
to sleep on the Newcastle mare; but the
truth is that Lucy would have been unlucky
to lose. Last at one stage, she was battling
for the lead with Royal Sun (9 to 2) at the
home turn, and then ran wide. Disposing of
the English horse nevertheless, slm was taken
to the rails by Percival, and while in that
position was tackled by Tibbie. She w’as
headed, and seemed beaten, but came again
(the Westralian riding most vigorously in the
decisive moments), and got there by a head,
in 2min. 21 (sec. She is a mean little thing
to look at, but she stay's well and is all grit.
A hurdler that has .T. E. Brewer for
owner and Ike Foulsham for trainer ought
to be a good one, and Micronesia is. So
dashing was his exhibition in Saturday's
affair over the battens, for which he was
favorite at 5 to 1, that he reached the end of
two miles in 3min. 38sec., which is claimed
to be a world’s record, though burdened with
list. 51b. Probably because of the pace he
set, several horses came to grief, and one
(Knighthood) was killed. Castles (20 to
1) was a meritorious second, and his rider,
who entered an unavailing protest for inter-
ference. thought he should have been t ; rst:
while the topweight, Grosvenor (list. 71b.),
was by no means a bad third. All three will
have to be considered for the more important
A.J.C. Hurdle Race on June 6. Micronesia
and Bagpipes (3 to 1 for the Welter) tem-
pered the wind to the shorn punter.
* iJJ * ♦
Trying to pick winners a day before the
acceptances—that is, three days before the
races—is unsatisfactory in some respects,
if the business is taken over-seriously. Making
a new departure with the enlargement of
the sporting section, The Bulletin came
out at the beginning of the month with
selections for the Saturday meetings at Syd-
ney. One of the troubles is to pick starters.
Three weeks ago Somnolent or Bacagi was
named for the Intermediate Handicap at
Warwick Farm, Dion or Duet for the May
Handicap, and Valparaiso or Chris for the
Casula Handicap. Bacagi was first and
Somnolent second (each at 5 to 1) ; Dion
ran unplaced; the others did not start. For
Rosehill the 1-2 method was adopted (and
will be stuck to, as a rule, except in the
case of big meetings) ; Reference and Golden
Grist were mentioned for the Auburn Handi-
cap, Lady Merriwa and Nolens Volens for
the Granville Stakes, Lucy Thrice and Dion
for the Rosehill Handicap, Goldbeater and
Sea Risk for the Highweight. Dion was
first and Lucy Thrice second (each at 12
to 1) ; Lady Merriwa was second (also at
12 to 1) ; Golden Grist and Goldbeater were
unplaced; the others were scratched. For
It and wick Cadenza was picked straightout
for the Flying Handicap (she ran second, at
12 to 1) and Lucy Thrice for the Winter
Stakes (first, at 10 to 1) ; of the other six
horses selected for four handicaps only Var-
ney (unplaced in Lucy Thrice’s race)
started. The Bulletin would be sorry to
suggest that anyone will get rich by follow-
ing its tips or those of any other paper, but
such prophecies are expected nowadays and
they will be supplied. Necessarily, final
gallops, jockeys and post positions are fac-
tors which cannot be taken into account.
Selections for Canterbury Park: —
Flying Handicap, six furlongs: Reference,
1 Slianakiel, 2.
Trial Stakes, six furlongs: Air Lady, 1;

There was a hint of a Grand National
chance about the victory of Fiscus (6 to 1)
in the Kororoit Hurdle at Williamstown.
A TWO-MILER.
FATHER: “That young Walker seems slow. He has been coming to the house for years
now.”
PHYLLIS: “Yes, Daddy, but I think he's sure. Not much of a sprinter, but a genuine
stayer.”
The Tasmanian gelding won well, as lie had
done the previous Saturday at Sandown
Park; on this occasion he led Jollity (6 to
1), known to Sydney punters, arid Swahilli
(2 to 1) home. The time, 3min. 39sec., is
a course record for two miles. Valaster (5
to 2) took the Steeple in comfortable fashion
from Liverpool (8 to 1) and Strath Blitli
(9 to 2). He jumps the Williamstown
fences cleverly, but Flemington is much
stiffer country. A. T. Creswick’s gelding
Buckshot has run most of his recent races
in front, and the last bit has generally found
him out. In the Bay View Handicap, 10
furlongs, for which Buffline was favorite,
Brady didn’t give the Bucklaw gelding his
head till about live furlongs from home: and,
sticking it out better this time, Ducksliot
lasted long enough to beat old Warwickshire
(10 to 1J by a head, with Valwyne (10 to
1), now owned by Norman Falkiner, half a
neck away. Duckshot, wdio is trained by J.
Cripps, started at 8 to 1, and left the 10
furlongs behind in 2min. 7|sec. Jumping
away well for Ashley Peed, Admng was
never headed in the Gellibrand Handicap,
and the very promising Nawallah (6 to j.)
finished in fine style in the Welter, to score
by a head frdm the rank outsider Isomer
(3 to 1), who was a neck in front of the
topweight Ambassador (7 to 1). Nawallah,
who is by Magpie—Bocran’s Sister, had won
at Sandown, and success should come his way
again. With three first favorites and a co-
favorite victorious, and backing for the other
two winners, the public got a bit of its
own back for the time being.

I)ivs. of £93 Bs. on the 10s. straight-out
tote and £8 16s. on the 10s. place machine
were paid on Sir Waddy. winner of a six-
furlong sprint at Canning Park, Perth, re-
cently. There were only 10 starters, and
McSliortodds’s price was 20 to 1, as against
nearly 186 to lon the s.o. implement. The
horse’s recent performances had included a
first and a second within three weeks, but he
was thought to be racing out of his distance
at Canning Park. If Sydney people were
provided with straight-out and place totes,
the Government wouldn’t need to worry about
the decline in receipts from machine betting.
McShortodds —particularly the tax-dodger in
the s.p. shop who has a 20-to-l limit, or
something like that —would do the worrying.
* * * 3=
“0.P.H.” : Hogan’s Labor Ministry (Vic.)
is not likely- to propose any additional levy
on McShortodds or to embarrass him by
introducing the tote. Prendergast’s Labor
Government was responsible for dropping the
higher tax on betting tickets; at any rate,
the sixpenny rate was not re-enacted and
the threepenny maximum was reverted to.
The versatile Allancocks proposed both the
tote and a tax on the ring's turnover. It
abandoned the tote proposal because men
who had promised support went cold, and it
was defeated on the motion to go into com-
mittee to consider the other impost.

“Retired Urger”: I see they wuz a court
case in Sydney th’ other day over a pony-
measurin’ row—a cove plastered another fer
30 notes, ’is bill fer shrinkin’ it. Th’ tot
useter get down to 14.1 one day an’ be over
14.2 th’ next, - an’ th’ barometer biz.
got on th' owner's nerves. It's a queer joke,
measurin’ ponies. Th’ best way’s, t’ get
thick with th’ measurer if 'e'll stand fer
it—they won’t in Kidney Pie. I knoo a
bloke ’oo was that absent-minded, if a fiver
’ad been slipped into ’is jacket pocket, that
’e’d rest th’ foot of th’ standard on ’is boot
when ’e was takin’ th’ measurement —an'
’e wore bonzer thick boot-soles, too. A good
dodge, if clippin’ or ’oof-parin’ or dosin’
wasn’t enough, was to rub red blisterin’
ointment inter th’ pony’s withers. Th' pore
little cow’d cringe as soon as a 'and or th’
standard gauge come near ’is withers, an’
that was good fer an inch anyway. One
nark I’d ’eard of in time knoo th’ joke, an’
useter sniff at th’ withers ter smell th’ oint-
ment. W’en I come along I was ready with
cayenne pepper, you betcher life. I ’eard
afterwards ’e'd cut th' sniffin’ game out fer
keeps. But it’s a crool game, from first ter
last, th’ ponies. A cove gets no charnce at
all, unless ’e’s a share’older.

‘'FY7”: Some months ago the Q.T.C.
committee installed an attendance-book at
Ascot racecourse, with instructions that
jockeys and apprentices must sigu it when
attending to ride work. The book was
ignored by a big proportion of the people
concerned, and, after the first three months,
the worst offenders were cautioned. This
had little effect, so the committee has
suspended one well-known rider till the end
of May, and fined another a fiver, besides
giving final notice to a lot more. The
action of the Q.T.C. is a desirable bit of
discipline worthy of general imitation.
“Kirkwall”: Another thing about the
Epsom Derby (B. 19/5/’27) is that the
winner lias never been owned by a woman.
Many ladies have had a shy at it, including
the amazing old Duchess of Montrose, but
their luck has been worse even than that of
the fillies, only four of which have finished
first in the famous classic. Of late years
women owners have been very much to the
fore in the acceptance-lists, and at least
seven prads nominated by women are expec-
ted to face the starter this time. None of
them are fancied in the betting, but Steve
Donoghoe may provide a surprise with Lady
Torrington’s Vanoc, on which he will have
the mount.
# :j: * ❖
“Ike Mcßagg”: There is still .evident
among British legislators a tendency to give
another turn or two to the screw which the
Exchequer has fastened on the struggling
bookmaker. The latest is a bill to remove
the ban on ready-money betting in offices and
apply the provisions of the. hard-hearted
Betting Act to all trancactions under this
head, with the result that the proprietors
will have to take out licenses and pay the
taxes. Many members of the profession
whose feelings had been outraged by the
Betting Act or -whose licenses had been
refused or cancelled by an officious Govern-
ment department turned to the peace of the
“nod” shops, and were rehabilitating their
fallen fortunes. The proposed legislation, if
passed, will destroy these refuges, to all
intents and purposes, and throw’ a number
of hapless victims on a pitiless world. And
the dart is feathered by the fact that it has
been launched by a member of that British
aristocracy which has hitherto been, from
time immemorial, the chief support of the
bookmaking order.

South Sydney continued its conquering
career in the Sydney Rugby League competi-
tion on Saturday, washing out Balmain at
the S.C.G. by 36 points to 14. The pace of
the premiers and their machine-like combina-
tion were too much for Balmain, whose solid
forward division, however, fought hard all
through. The fast-moving Lapham scored
four tries for South. St. George, still un-
beaten, like the premiers, had an easy job
with North Sydney, which once-great team
it downed by 24 to 7. Eastern Suburbs won
by 22 to 11 from Newtown, bad handling
losing Newtown several points; and Western
Suburbs overcame University by 21 to 12;
the students are not nearly as good, on the
whole, as they were last year, though
O’Rourke, the inter-State centre, is in fine
fettle.
The Rugby Union put on a fine triple
bill at the Showground, two metropolitan
sides engaging country teams and a N.S.W.
XV meeting Combined Universities. N.S.W.
gave a brilliant display, beating Combined
Universities by 28 to 11. The defeated XV
contained the cream of Sydney Uni.’s power-
ful side, -while the Maorilanders included were
all Provincial representatives —one was here
with the All Blacks last year and another
went to Europe with Parata’s Maoris. Yet
the N.S.W. side was superior in all depart-
ments. Wallace played his best game since
returning to Australia, and his Oxford con-
frere, Lawton, was little, if anything, behind
him. The Maorilanders, accustomed to a
two-man front row, with, a pack of seven
forwards and a winger, three halves and
three three-quarters, were asked to. play the
N.S.W. style of three in the front row, an
eight pack, two halves and four .three-
quarters. Naturally, the two systems failed
to click, and a side'of brilliant individualists
couldn’t pick up combination. N.S.W.’s
tough and fast pack included Howell, of
Newcastle, who is likely to be chosen to go
abroad. The country teams lost, both their
matches against metropolitan sides, being
perhaps a bit: stale after their feast of foot-
ball during the week; but Burke, also of
Newcastle, made a .strong impression as full-
back. and may get the job of offsider to
Ross.

After having been just beaten (1-nil) by
Czechb-Slovakia in a mid-week Soccer match,
the Victorian team added two N. S. Welsh-
men, called itself Australia and met the
visitors at the M.C.G. The first, half was
an even argument until Hochmann got past
Bingham (Prahran’s goalie) with a tremen
dous drive that curved like a snake in pain.
The Czechos’ footwork was pretty and they

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Where’s the Bohemia we knew,
Or dimly in our dreams descried,
The land where poets, painters too,
Convention’s ukases defied
And quaffed from morn to eventide
Of joie de vivre and wine the mocker?
Clean-gone, with all the name implied—
The Czecho-Slovak’s turned to Socker.
Where are the madcap gypsy crew
Who lived and loved, and drank and died,
And staged so many a glad sliivoo
At Prague, by rolling Moldau’s side.
And spent and lent and scattered. wide
While any krone was in the locker?
Vanished across the Great Divide.
The Czecho-Slovak’s game is Socker.
The leather blown they now pursue
And deftly through the goal-posts guide.

In songs that vibrant passion sighed.
The revelries in which they vied
To give the graver lands a shocker
Merely as memories abide,
Now Czecho-Slovaks shine at Socker.

bullet. A minute after the interval the
visitors rushed their second goal and stirred
the Australians to emulation. A beautiful
series of exchanges between the home for-
wards ended in Orr’s left foot driving the
leather past.the prostrate form of the Czech
goalie. The final score, was 4-1 in favor
of the travellers. Knizek is their star goal-

The meeting of South Melbourne andColling-
wood brought over 39,006 to South’s ground
on Saturday. Hard and rugged play, inter-
spersed with flashes
of brilliance, found
’Wood a little fas-
ter and a < little 1
more concerted, so
that at the interval
the Magpies led by
2 points-. Oh- re-
suming they * un-
wound a series of
systematic passes,
combined with cor-
rect handling, that
put on 5 goals
right off, and. when
the game ended
they had ,106
points to South’s
67. Many men
limped off sore
after it was over,
but there was no
spite. On the other
hand, at Geelong,
where the seasiders
encountered Carl-
ron, the numerous
casualties were
largely the result
of bad feeling. Col-
lins, Carlton’s
centre, laid out
early, was of little
use afterwards;
Warren, of Gee-
long, required seven
stitches to keep his
co untena nee in
place, and Hagger,
though he kicked
11 goals, so angered
the crowd that the
Law had to prevent its proceeding from
pebbles and clods to half-bricks. Geelong
collected 123 points to Carlton’s 77. North
Melbourne kept, its place at the head of the
list by trouncing Hawthorn. 133 points to
56; Footscray went down wallop before Rich-
mond, with but 30 points to the Tigers’ 100;
Melbourne outed Essendon with 78 points to
60; and Fitzrov started the long up-liill
climb by scoring 92 points to St. Kilda’s 75.
M.Q. (and. Rafferty) Rules
No onlooker with a knowledge of boxing
could do other than agree witli the verdict
of Joe Wallis at the end of the 15 rounds
fought by Jim Williams (list. 101 lb.) and
Charlie Long (list. 41b.) at the Sydney
Stadium. Williams got the award, and
thoroughly earned it, though he had (o light
furiously and use every trick of the trade, for
Long never loafed for one second. The first
and second rounds were slightly in Williams’s
favor. The third lie won by a good margin,
steadying Long with right uppercuts and left
swings to the face, while the smaller black
tore short’uns to the body. The fourth,
desperately contested, was equal. Williams
took the fifth by a street; lie had Long bleed-
ing at the mouth and getting puffy of feat-
ure. The next four rounds were fairly even,
but Williams took charge again in the tenth
and kept the lead to the end. He dropped
Long with a heavy right to the ear in the
fourteenth, and when resuming hostilities
Charles had the look of a man who knew
he was being licked.
Hi He
“Centurion”: The spectacle of imported
blacks—sometimes one, sometimes two —get-
ting the big money every Saturday night is
rousing even the ; S. M. Herald to protest.
Still, it can’t be said that Australian boxers
are altogether neglected. Those in the pre-
liminary class get £2 apiece for a four-round
bout, £3 for a six-round go, and a whole,
splendid £5-note for a ten-rounder. Ten
bob' a round, in short, while two negroes
drew '£4l2 each for less than three rounds.
Naturally, there is no workers’ compensa-
tion for these pampered white lads should
they be injured while earning their ten bob
a round. The benevolent Labor party, re-
presentatives of which are conspicuous among
the crowds that cheer the colored pugs on,
carefully excluded boxers from the benefits
of the new Act, though shoals of other small
contractors were included.
“8.M.”: “Griffo,” as well as being the
cleverest of all boxers, was the quaintest
ring character Australia ■ ever had. Taken
to Melbourne for a mill, lie looked so dis-
reputable on arrival that a stern trainer
drove straight to an outfitter’s, whence the
fodder emerged in a slop-made suit arid —
what he had never worn before —socks. That
same night lie slipped liis keeper, to return
home about midnight, beered and sockless.
“What did yer do with yer socks?” the
wrathful trainer asked. “Oh, dem,” said
“Griffo” carelessly. “Dat poor bloke I wuz
wit, ’e seen dem on me plates o’ meat an’
sez ’e likes dem. So I pulled dem orf and
give dpm to’im.” And lie was quite capable
of giving away the slop-made suit if the
other had asked fop it.

“J. 8.”: There were some great doings at
the Sydney Stadium when “Snowy” Baker
NOBLE ART STUDY.
A black-and-white draw-ing.
was master of ceremonies. I remember one
joyous occasion when two ringsiders, excited
by the spectacle of what two Yankees were
doing between the ropes, got into holts. They
hit, kicked and rolled on the ground, the
mob in their vicinity urging them on. Sud-
denly one of the glove-fighters struck the
other a foul blow and dropped him like an
axe-stricken ox. Infuriated men—there
seemed to be millions of them —yelled and
cursed and started to pull the Stadium u n by
the roots. “Snowy” Baker was the only
calm man there. He stood in deep thought,
evidently arriving at liis decision, when an
excited second climbed into the ring and
made threatening motions with his fists.
“Snowy” hit him one crack which could be
heard above the shrieks of some hysterical
women. When 1 found myself outside the
Stadium I couldn’t see out of one eye, and
I had lost a boot. A grand night!
Hi V H* *!*
“White Horse” : Mick Dooley, still alive and
hearty in Westralia, had some queer experi-
ences during his long ring career. He un-
doubtedly beat Joe Goddard at Sydney
Amateur Gymnastic Club, but the referee-
stuttered over the “ten, out,” as it was done
in those days, and Joe struggled to his feet
before the honorary official had done “ow-ow”-
ing. In the return match in Melbourne Mick
had Joe on the canvas for fully ten seconds,
but when Jack Fuller suggested that the
timekeeper should remember what lie was
there for that official rushed round the out-
side of the ring, with dangling watch, to re-
buke Dooley’s second. “Well, look,” remon-
strated Jack, “’e’s still down. Why don’t you
count ’im out?” The timekeeper came to and
re-started the count at “seven,” but before
“ten” was reached Goddard was on his feet.
The rest is history.
* * *
“Biffspear” : Bert Spargo’s appearance as
an actor in a Sydney show recalls the many
professional boxers and wrestlers • who have
been called on to take such parts as Charles
the Wrestler and submit to ignominious de-
feat. To none did this come harder than
to “Gorilla” Gilhooley. engaged by the Lon-
don Lyceum and Fitzcray Dramatic Co. for
a tour of the Queensland “smalls.” The
Gorilla was the most insufferably conceited
artist who ever appeared on any stage or
in any ring, which is saying a lot. But
he hated walking, and was told that this,
in a homeward direction, would be his por-
tion unless he adhered strictly to the stage
manager’s instructions. So whenever a part
like Charles came his way lie submitted to
the inevitable, but not until he had given
Orlando, or whoever the hero was, a rough
passage. When the time for his defeat had
com?, be would wink at the audience while
ejaculating in a pig’s whisper, “Y’ know,
it’s all a blanky fake.”

Ted Thye (12st. 121 b.) and Billy Meeske
(same weight) had possession of the mat
at Melbourne Stadium on Saturday night
and, compared with the disturbances in
which Edwards took part, : tlieir display was
quite sedate. Thye, whose first appearance
it was for the season, was above himself in
condition and slower than usual on that
account. Hpwever, he applied wristlocks
from all angles, and they were as great a
nuisance to Billy as the net to a beginner
in tennis. William fell foul of them at every
turn, and surrendered to one in the third
round. The fifth was the least unexciting
round ; first the Aussie had the advantage with
a well-sustained deadlock, and later with an
arm bar: but, breaking free, the Yank gave
Bill , a heap of trouble with a succession of
wrist'loeks. In the sixth term the tall Oregon
grappler submitted rather tamely to a side
deadlock and body scissors in lmin. 22sec.
The deciding fall came in the next session,
when the Cornstalk, attacking from behind,
was tin'own backwards on his shoulders and
pinned.
Racquet and Bawl
The City of .Sydney lawn tennis tourna-
ment was largely : a repetition of the N.S.W -
Vie. affair of the previous week; most of the
Victorians who came over for the earlier
event took part. The final battle for the
singles was particularly interesting, for the
players were Jack Crawford, this year’s State
and junior champion, and F. E. Ivalms, who
won the State and country titles last year.
Kalins began well, capturing the first set,
4—o, but the youngster gradually adapted
his play to the countryman’s tactics, and
though the latter ran him to B—6 in the
third set, Crawford took the last with a lot
in hand; 6—l. In the doubles O’Hara Wood
arid Wfertheim showed perfect understanding,
the Victorian pair beating Schlesinger and
Williams 6 —3, 6 —2, 6 —3. Daphne Akhurst,
of N.S.W., turned the tables on Mrs. Martin,
her conqueror of the inter-State women’s
singles, by winning 6 —o, 6 —l, but Mrs.
Martin and Mrs. O'Hara Wood defeated Miss
Akhurst and Mrs. Utz in the doubles.
■J.: * ( V * *
“W.J.P.”: N.S.W. tennis is to lose R.
Schlesinger, who is going back to Victoria in
September. During his sojourn in Sydney
Schlesinger has become a favorite with
players and crowds, both for his keenness on
the court and his good sportmanship. He
will always be welcome should he return
with future Vic. teams.
Hi Hi Hi Hi
“15-30”: Tilden is reported to have said
that lie hopes he and Johnston will be allowed
to defend the Davis Cup against the pro-
bable onslaught of France this year. Since
they snatched the Cup from Australia in
1920, Tilden and Johnston have kept Old
Glory flying over the American tennis cita-
del. Tn the singles Tilden has survived every
challenge round without a defeat, though he
was very close to the white flag and burnt-
feather stage against Lacoste last time. The
one black mark on Johnston’s record is
THE QUEST.
D RIVER: “I think it's a case of give it up, old
man, and call it a lost ball.”
STRIVER: "Bail? I gave up looking for the
darned ball long ago. I’m looking for
my bag!”
J. O. Anderson’s five-set triumph, in which
the Cornstalk dazzled the small Californian
with an unusual exhibition of servied aces.
And there has only been one loss in the
doubles, due to the superb play of Patter-
son and O’Hara Wood, who ran out in three
sets straight.
❖ ❖ H« H*
“Amateur Pro.”: The decision of Rice
Gemmell to turn professional has been rather
welcomed than otherwise by the Westralian
association, which officially wished Gemmell
luck in his new career. Though his loss as
an amateur will be felt, it is recognised that
his services as a coach will more than make
up for that. There is a scarcity of qualified
coaches in 1 the West. This is not the case in
the East, ’where there are many long-estab-
lished professional coaches whom an invasion
from the amateur ranks would injure. It
will be a pity if this happens; for, judging by
the dozens of high-class players that this
country has produced, the older type Of pro.
has done liis work well.
* *
“Linesman”: While tennis keeps thousands
of Australians in action on Saturday after-
noons, Badminton, its smaller indoor rela-
tive, is almost unknown out here. Yet Bad-
minton is a fast-moving pastime which calls
for greater speed and accuracy than a
singles at tennis, because the missile struck
by the racquet is not a ball, but our old
friend the shuttlecock, and on that account
lias to be volleyed (or struck on the full)
to keep it in play. Badminton has numerous
enthusiasts in Britain, and for nearly 30
years now there has been a regular annual
championship for singles and doubles at
which many tennis players appear. Kitty
Mclvane (Mrs. Godfree), who is talking of
visiting us, is an ardent follower of Bad-
minton, and has lifted a trophy or two in
partnership with certain stars.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Schlaff”: The Kirk-Windeyer Cup was
originally offered for an annual tourney be-
tween Maoriland and an Australian State;
M.L. and N.S.W. officials drew up the
scheme and two of them presented the trophy
for competition. Though Queensland, N.S.W.
and Maoriland have entered teams, the Vic.
G.A. has refused to do so, on the ground
that only the Australian G.U. should control
such a competition, and that it did not
approve,of some of the conditions. Neverthe-
less four leading Vic. players who will be
in Sydney for the championships will, if their
entry is accepted, tqke part in the Kirk-
Windeyer contest.
❖ H? Hi Hi
“Ploughman”'. As to palatial golf-club-
houses (B. 5/5/’27), what about the Vic-
toria club’s new shieling at Melbourne?
It cost £30,000, and is by far the most
luxurious in Australia. Prime Minister
Bruce, who opened the show, said that the
qualities required for success at golf were
valuable to a nation. Obviously the chief
quality for a club like the Victoria is ttw
possession of surplus cash.
* * * *
“Mid-iron": A good many golfers who
ought to know better are careless about
keeping their clubs in good condition. They
rarely wipe shafts or heads dry after rain :
then they wonder why warping or faulty
glueing makes, itself evident. There is an
example for the casual ones in the account,
of the equipment of Molly Gourlay, a former
English champion, at Roehampton. It was
raining hard during the lady’s round, and it
was observed that each of her clubs had a
separate waterproof bag, to which it was
returned as soon as used. Molly herself
faced wind and rain without hat or coat.
* # * *
“Mid-iron”: A rare old “gowfer” is S.
Larard, an 80-year-old member of the
Charleville (Q.) club. On his birthday
recently he and a friend played another pair
a four-ball over 18 holes. At the turn the
ancient and his mate were one down, but,
rallying, they won by four and three. The
old gentleman plays regularly on Saturdays
and Sundays, and considers himself off his
game if he can’t at least tie with bogey.
“Key” : “Drapener’s” par. (B.
T4/4/’27) recalls an almost
identical feat at the fifth hole
on the Warrhambool (Vic.)
links. The short fifth at Warr
nambool is guarded by a clump
of pines. Lifting his tee shot,
J. A. Black, a Mt. Noorat sports-
man, was surprised to see his
ball rebound from a dead limb,
strike a post on the fourth
green'and then trickle into the
hole. There happened to be
no “nineteenth,” but the green keeper led
the way to a substitute.
* $ * H:
. “Divot Digger*: The Brisbane club's links
were the scene of an unnerving happening
during a recent four-ball match. Driving
off at the tenth, all four players came to
grief, and had to drive a new ball from the
tee. The first player sliced his drive out
of bounds, as did the second and the third.
The fourth man varied the muck-up by pull-
ing liis shot into a creek. Nothing quite so
disconcerting has been reported since a
Downs golfer lodged his ball in a cow’s ear.
His opponent, an authority on the rules,
advised him to “play as it lies,” but the
cow’s behavior rendered this inadvisable,
not to say impracticable, and he decided to
drop a ball.

“Uao-dah”: Mrs. O’Brien and her five small
O’Briens, and her sister Mrs. Bullock and
her three, hired a service car and a driver
and came holidaying from Adelaide to Mel-
bourne. It just shows another way the road
is beating the rail. Ten railway fares would
have cost the trippers more than car hire did.
and they would have lost three-quarters of
the fun. They crossed in the Murray punt
with a herd of elephants—part of a circus.

“Centurion”: A fresh attempt to simplify
car control is announced by F. W. Uan-
chester, one of the world’s greatest auto-
mobile engineers. The different functions
are controlled by a single lever. The accele-
rator pedal is mounted on the brake pedal,
an extended movement of tire accelerator
working the brake. The accelerator is con-
nected by a link having a lost-motion device
to a lever connected with the throttle.
Depressing the accelerator opens the throttle
till, when fully open, the accelerator con-
tacts with a stop in the brake pedal lever.
Further movement of the accelerator de-
presses the brake, the throttle being auto-
matically closed by the action of the lost-
motion link.

“Split Pin” : Not all the future improve-
ment in motor-car design will be confined to
the engine (B. 5/5/’27f. British designers
aim at perfecting an all-aluminium chassis,
or at least one of duralamin, the alloy
which plays such an important part in auto-
mobile and aeroplane construction. That
ideal attained, we shall have a car lighter
by far than the most cut-down models of
to-day, and much stronger. That will mean,
in turn, less horse-power, less fuel consump-
tion and less depreciation.
* * * *
. “Garry” : The worst handicap against the
British car-maker in the Dominions is the
Old Dart’s sumptuary law against powerful
engines. Car taxes are based on cylinder
capacity, and in order not to scare pur-
chasers away with the certainty of a stiff
annual tax British makers of moderate-
priced cars have cut down engine-power.
If the motor-making Englishmen now touring
Australia can be convinced that this country
needs bigger engines and doesn’t have to pay
taxes on ’em their industry will benefit.
Sfc * *
“Trembler” : Recent discussions as to the
cost of motoring overlook the fact that the
driver’s individuality counts for a great deal.
The man who takes care of his car will
find his costs far lower than he who trusts
a lot to luck; this is especially true with
regard to lubrication, the most paying duty
an owner can observe. For the family man,
the car is the most economic transport there
is, if properly managed, since tram, train
and other fares are cut out. Motoring costs
are getting lower every day, including the
cost of the car itself. This is down to pre-
war level, but as the car is a much better
one it really is far cheaper. The same is
true of tyres, and nearly every other item
of car equipment, for the life of a tyre to-
day is three times that of the tyre of 14
years ago.
Miscellaneous
“Slide”: The swamping of boats in the
late inter-State eiglit-oar race has revived
interest in discovering a practicable means
of quickly getting rid of the water in the
shell. At Hobart Westralia won with its
boat: half-full, while the second crew, N.S.W,.
only kept afloat by bailing, the cox adding
this to his other duties. Victoria and South
Aus. sank after finishing; Tasmania and
Queensland sank during the race. Many
dodges have been tried to get rid of the
water, and S. E. Swan, a famous Cambridge
oarsman, seems to have struck the best.
Swan has been experimenting with a boat
fitted with outlet valves like those employed
in lifeboats, the valves being under the cox’s
seat. The idea has worked so well that
Oxford and Cambridge are to adopt it forth-
with.
“Leander”: The Murray Bridge crew did
not suffer unduly from inadequate provision
for housing, training and boating in Paris,
as “Slide” (B. 12/5/’27) supposes. The
men took up quarters at Nogent-on-Marne
a few days after their arrival in Paris, and
enjoyed almost ideal conditions for several
Aveeks prior to their removal to Argcntcuil,
on the other side of the metropolis, close to
the Olympic course. At Nogent they lived
at a cafe immediately opposite the boatslied
from which they operated. Aided by special
food, they thrived on their work and were
shaping well when the transfer in location
occurred. Matters were not so congenial at
Argenteuil, as it was impossible to get quar-
ters within a couple of miles of the boat-
house; this distance was no handicap, how-
ever'. as the Murray Bridgers were taken in
a conveyance to and from the course on each
of their spins. The acclimatisation factor
certainly affected their form, and owing to
sickness several men were unable to take part
in the final trials. But tire principal reason
for failure was that the South Australians
were not, and never had been, up to the
standard of the Tale crew. Yale won in
smin. Slsec., 14sec. faster than the pre-
vious best time for the distance. "Slide”
has strayed on to the wrong course when he
denounces the Olympic Council for inepti-
tude. I ought to know the facts, having
been a member of the rowing section of our
Olympic team.

“M.G.S.”: Cobliam’s proposal that book-
makers should be introduced into flying led
to my getting a vision of the London-Mel-
bournc Cup of 1939. It was the most bril-
liant and widely attended in the history
of the fixture. The start from Cricklewood
(Eng.) was watched by one million people in
person, though, of course, the entire popula-
tion of the globe was enabled, not only to wit-
ness the race from kick-off to finish by tele-
vision, but to lay bets by wireless telephone
at every stage. Unfortunately the favorite,
AE49.3, was unable to leave the ground,
water having been substituted for petrol in
its tanks by some of the “heads.” The
second favorite. XT23, was shot down while
well in the lead by anti-aircraft guns located
in the Taurus Mountains and alleged to
have been commissioned by the Turkish
Government, which had risked several mil-
lions, the proceeds of the harem tax, on the
third favorite, 89. That machine, although
so far ahead in crossing India that the
bookmakers on the Ganges refused to bet
against it “in running,” failed to put in an
appearance over Singapore, being, it is
stated, jostled against the Malay Peninsula
by an unmarked aeroplane for which aerial
stewards searched in vain. Another story
is. that B 9 was fired on and brought down
by a warship flying the colors of the Chinese
Government, which had drawn the fourth
favorite in Tattersall’s 20-million-guinea
sweep. Early on the morning of the last
day the remaining contestants were seen in
a bunch flying low over Alice Springs at
an average speed of 452 m.p.h. Excitement
spread throughout the world when it became
A CONVERSATIONALI ST,
DAD (to migrant); "He’s all right — he's only
playing. You want to talk to him.”
N.C.: “W-w-ichat does he like to talk about?”
known that a rank outsider, GX3, previ-
ously reported 2000 miles in the rear, was
creeping to the front; and the excitement
grew to fever-heat when the reporters who
were “calling the race” mentioned that Nicara-
gua had raised an enormous loan from
American financiers two hours earlier and
placed it all on GX3 at odds ranging from
50 to 100 to one, most of it with Melbourne
bookmakers. Passing over Mildura GX3
had a lead of 53 miles. Half an hour later
the biggest multitude ever assembled in
Australia was roaring her name while she
hovered over Essendou preparatory to drop-
ping to the ground. It was a proud day for
Nicaragua, but it had one unfortunate sequel
from the Central American point of view.
The entire Melbourne ring “took the knock.”

The Australian team of swimmer's -which
is to leave for a tour of Japan at the end
of July will consist of E. W. Jones (West-
ralia), R. Grier (Q.), Ivan Stednran (Vic.)
and E. Henry (N.S.W.). With the excep-
tion, perhaps, of Grier the team does not
seem to have much chance against the Jap-
anese over the shorter distances, taking a
line on the form shown here by Takaishi
and Saito. Jones, however, should do well
in the distance events, and as he and Grier
are both fancied candidates for the Olympic
team the tour ought to prove a valuable
experience.

“Spikes”: Prank Schultz, the bronzed
Queensland six-footer, may have run 300
yai'ds in 29 4-ssec. at Roma (B. 12/5/'27),
but his friends will have difficulty in con-
vincing the Australasian Athletic Council
that he did. It is'only a month or two since
Schultz was reported to have broken down
and gone into the paddock for a spell. Either
the timekeepers at Roma blundered or else
the course was short, with a gale of wind
behind the Bananalander. who is certainly
a fine runner but no Donaldson or Hutchens.
The association requires notice of an
attempt on a record, and the claim, if any,
has to be supported by three official watch-
holders. Then the authorities abroad have
to be satisfied that these and other details
have been faithfully observed.

‘'Davos”: Ski-ing, a sport which has its
devotees in the mountainous parts of N. S.
Wales and Victoria, should gain in interest
with the arrival in Australia of Chris Mac-
intosh, a young man with a European repu-
tation as a performer on the long wooden
snowshoes. An Oxford Rugby and athletic
blue, Macintosh is going to tackle fruit-
growing in this country with his wife, a
daughter of the great Scottish house of
Hamilton. The ski has been in use for many
years in the Monaro uplands and the Vic-
torian end of the Great Dividing Range, but
for obvious reasons it is never likely to come
into general use in Australia. It is interest-
ing to note that the long, narrow, Norwegian
wooden appliance has almost superseded the
North American-Indian snowshoe, made of
hide thongs and bent birchwood, in the coun-
try of its origin.

“Shrewsbury" : The N.S.W. Cricket Asso-
ciation .will presently propose some changes
in the rules governing Sheffield Shield com-
petitions, notably the limiting of matches to
four days, with two and a half hours on
the fifth, if necessary ; the awarding of points
to 1 competing teams —four for an out-
right win, three for a win on the first
innings and two for a draw —and the com-
pulsory covering of wickets, a matter now
left to the discretion of local authorities.
Two of the suggestions are overdue. Week-
long matches have become a weariness; and
the method of scoring by points will obviate
the difficulties raised by Queensland’s entry
to the competition. But the enforced cover-
ing of wickets is a retrograde proposal. For
Heaven’s sake, let us give the bowlers a
chance now and then !
* * * *
“Murkah” : With Rig Booty, a giant puppy
of the same litter as his Derby and Oaks
winners, the usual Buckley annexed the
Produce Stakes at Liverpool (N.S.W.).
Booty, an 891 b. dog, outweighs by nearly a
stone and a' half the next heaviest grey-
hound in Australia. “Too big,” said the
experts; but Buckley’s outsize flier made
half-dozen opponents look cheap. Should he
ever strike hard going, however, he will need
hoofs. The Walker Whisky event was col-
lared by Andy, who is as interesting a study
in his way as Big Booty. He is the most
dejected-looking animal in the business. But
he forgets his depression when the hare is re-
leased. • In three stakes (21 courses) this
season no other dog has led or beaten the
sorrowful streak.
* * * *
“The Gaffer”: English papers are giving
a lot of notice to Captain Lowry, blinded
in France in 1914. He was a fine athlete
before the misfortune, and, being only 24,
he set his teeth and carried on—to such
purpose that he reckons he has developed his
brain to the point of being able to see
without eyes, as it were. He is a fine
swimmer, track runner, diver, boxer and ball-
puncher. To cap all, he is a really good
bridge player, though sightless card-players
are unheard of elsewhere. Old Queensland
“heads” will recall Blind Harry, a profes-
sional punter and hazard-player of years
ago. No quicker or keener bettor ever threw
a main. Though he had an offsider to call
the dice for him, he needed no help in the
bandying of odds and bets that goes on round
the table when a hot hazard-school is at
work. Of course, there are plenty of sports
who suffer from temporary blindness when
they pass a creditor on settling day, but
their sort can be cured.

“Bishop”: The meeting of Crackanthorp
and Purdy in the play-off for the N.S.W.
chess championship will be talked about by
enthusiasts for many a year. The game took
hours, spread over three evenings; and
with a queen and pawn against Crackan-
thorp’s queen the young fellow had a solid
advantage. But the old champion worked
the pieces into a position in which he was
able to take the pawn with the certainty
that if Purdy took his queen there would
be a stalemate. It was a draw for which
Crackanthorp deserves credit; this is prob-
ably the only stalemate that has been forced
in a championship game. Perhaps the nerves
of the older man stood the test of the pro-
tracted tussle better than those of Purdy,
who is still only a youngster, though he has
been reckoned in the first class of N.S.W.
players since he was a 16-year-old student
at Cranbrook College. In the last Common-
wealth championship tournament he was
third.
Business, Robbery., etc.
“JimCarew” : “Centre” (8.21/4/’27) asks if
anyone has tried myrtle’for tool-handles. I have
and found it satisfactory. Like “Centre,"
I was warned against it, but used it' for
a maul-handle and found it outlasted both
spotted-gum and bloodwood. But as a maul-
head it was a blow-out. It broke in,’less
than half an hour.
=;: * * *
.“R. Mort”: The Speck threatens to add
the manufacture of artificial silk to its in-
dustries, and very nice, too; but why not
turn attention to necessities as well as
luxuries? What’s wrong with household
crockery for a beginning? We’ve as much
kaolin here as they have in Staffordshire.
Yet even our York souvenir tea-sets are
imported!
* * * *
“Troy”: The Maoriland Publicity Depart-
ment is joining the ranks of cigarette-card
advertisers. A series of 50 pictures adver-
tising the attractions of the Dominion has
been prepared, and these will be pushed into
the boxes of various imported brands of
cigarettes. The Maorilanders ought to take
“Nikko’s” advice (B. 12/5/’27) and make
their own coffin-nails, instead of exporting
the makings to Yankeeland.
* * * *
“Centurion”: The Australian beef-trade
Lazarus got an extra crumb or two from
Dives’s cradle last week, when the British
War Office placed a contract for 0070 tons
of frozen beef and 380 tons of frozen mut-
ton. The stuff is to be delivered in Egypt,
Malta and Gibraltar during the year eliding
May, 1928. Small as it is, the job is a
welcome one, and may be the forerunner of
others which are badly needed.
* * * * *
“Emel": Revaluation of soldier-settlers’
blocks on the basis of present market prices
wouldn’t suit them all. Here are two cases
in point, both on the old Yectis estate, which
lies along the Wimmera, 15 miles from Hor-
sham (Vic.). One man bought his land on
the usual long soldier-settler terms at £9
per acre. To-day he values it at £l5. The
other farm, bought at £ll. is now worth £26.
And that is no fancy estimate, for the owner
has actually refused that figure.
* * * *
“Murkah” : A listener-in, not only during
the silent watches of the night, but between
drinks, can hear the round-the-world chain
of British naval radio-stations bidding each
other good-day. Six times in the 24 hours
each station establishes communication with
the centre of this all-embracing web at
Horsea (Eng.). Seychelles, Mauritius. Dur-
ban, Port Said, Malta. Gibraltar, Singapore.
Hong Kong, Garden Island (Sydney) and
Williamstown (Melb.) are some of them—
all erected and controlled and operated by
the British Navy.
* * *
“Mako”: Maorilanders in Australia
wonder why the Commonwealth P.O. did not
earlier introduce the handy little stamp-
meters in use by all big business firms m
the Dominion, and why even the biggest
post offices sell stamps over the counter
when a slot machine could do it just as
well. The stamp-meter has more than ■ one
advantage, as was discovered when ,an epi-
demic of objectionable anonymous letters
struck Auckland some years ago. Thcy had
been stamped by meter, and it was an easy
matter to find what office they came from,
as each meter prints its own number on
every letter put through.
* * * *
“Yarra Ben” : The ancient Hobson’s Bay-
steamer Edina had a birthday the other
day—her 73rd. Launched at Glasgow in
’54, she first bucked the billows of the North
Sea. Transferred to Australian waters m
’(54. she was running for some time between
Melbourne and Warrnambool. Then _ for a
short spell she took a turn at trading to
Maoriland. In ’(57, when the Duke of Edin
burgh visited Melbourne, the Edina took
the official party down the bay. In ’76
Howard Smith bought her for the Queens-
land trade, afterwards placing her on the
Melbourne-Geelong run, and the old girl is
still earning dividends.
* * * *
“Les. R.”: There was excited yelling-from
a Chinaman on the platform, and. a seedy-
looking individual, protesting his innocence,
was being escorted away. “What’s lie been
up to?” I asked. “Oh, he’s a long-distance
fare-scaler, and an expert too,” said one of
the station staff. “He carries a porters
cap about with him —stolen, I suppose. Pur-
ting it on, he goes along the train calling
out ‘All tickets, please!’ Ticking a mug.
he tells him there is something wrong with
his ticket, asks him where he got it. etc..
then, saying that he will have to show it
to, the stationmaster, lie pockets the ticket—
and hides his porter’s cap. Grabbing :i
vacant seat in any of the carriages, exeep’
the one his victim occupies, he starts on his
journey; and it generally comes off, too.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER

SLIPPER HEEL

STOCKINGS
For women the second Triennial Confer-
ence of the Australian Women’s Federation
tor Equal Citizenship was the really im-
portant happening of the week. But apart
from those workers who are already allied
to one or another political or semi-political
body, woman did not rush the Chamber of
Commerce, which housed the conference. On
no occasion would you in passing the doors
have judged by hordes of clamorous females
without that a sale of silk stockings was
raging within. Yet it is through such con-
ferences and those who labor for them that
woman has annexed enough privileges to
patch up the always rather threadbare chiv-
alry of man.
The small, well-dressed, pink and wdiite
Westralian, Mrs. Rischbeith, proved herself
a splendid shepherd not only of her own
thoughts but of the thoughts and ideas of
Ihe delegates from every - State. And she
continues president of the society under its
new and less cumbersome title, the Austra-
lian Federation of Women Voters. A motion
urging that, the fatherless child and its mother
should be considered wards of the State
shrined one of the finest ideas propounded
in the long talk; and this was a result of
the clear and forceful report on “The Un-
married Mother and Her Child” presented
by South Australian Mrs. Carlile McDon-
nell. Other engrossing subjects were child
endowment and like conditions of work for
men and women. Here Mrs. Jamieson Wil-
liams frolicked upon her native heath, so to
speak; for this is a subject with which the
little Scots lady with the burr on her tongue
is saturated through and through. Tas-
manian delegate Mrs. Waterworth demanded
more policewomen for her island home. Well,
perhaps if Eve had known there were one
or two women bobbies about Eden, she
might never have started the family trouble
over the apple. Mrs. Goodison, racial hygiene
enthusiast, added a pearl or two of wisdom ;
and so did Miss Walker (S.A.). The appoint-
ment of women to the Film Censorship
Board, a uniform marriage law for all Aus-
tralia, the appointment of women assessors
to speak at the Premiers’ Conference on
matters that relate to women and children
were a few of the matters threshed out with
balance, moderation and quiet force.
Woman is turning a reflective eye on
South Australia since Miss Walker declared
at the conference that “marriage is easier
in South Aus. and divorce harder than in
any other State.” It sounds like Elysium
for the woman in search of matrimony. In
Warringah, where last Saturday’s by-election
raged, no fewer than 7000 more women than
men were on the rolls. If South Aus. doesn’t
get some of that surplus, woman can’t take
a hint as promptly as she generally thinks
she can.
Lorgnettes went up at a dance the other
night with something like a snort when some
care-free youngsters swirled into the arena
displaying pantalettes through the spreading
tulle hem of tlieir frocks. The frocks were
of taffeta to the knee, and thence the hem
fell to the ankle—like a little transparent
curtain. Through these the pantalettes, made
of the same colored taffeta as the flounce
above mentioned, tipped a wink to the out-
raged seniors. But the style is only a modern
adaptation of a more blatant one in vogue
when great-grandmother blushed and sim-
pered in her virginal innocence. Then the
idea was to have coy little pantalettes of
white smirking up at the beholder, hinting
at the odalisque charms of the wearer. And
talking of clothes and the Woman recalls
that a confirmed clubman who lived through
the crinoline days declares that they were
the only skirts that ever caused him to
blush. So let grandmama put that in her
fag and smoke it!
Again the Women Painters' show failed to
charm the trustees of the National Gallery
into buying even one picture. The query
before the society now is which is the short-
est: cut to the Gallery walls —to paint better
pictures or to get Maie Murray or Pola
Negri interested in the Women Painters’
doings. To what a mush of concession
the sinuous Pola’s murmured recommenda-
tion of her sisters’ wares might reduce the
dear old gentlemen who buy for the National
storehouse! If Pola Negri isn’t available,
what about trying to interest our own
Queen of Song, the incomparable business
woman known in the concert profession as
the Gold Dredge? The sales at the show this
year ran from fair to just about weather-
th e-storm. Yet many of the pictures were
pleasing, and some of them were of out-
standing merit. The Women Painters should
try calling themselves Bolshies in Art, and
,ioist a slogan :
Art only.sQ per cent, pure,
Clothes 100 per cent, fewer.
Then they could sit back and write out the
first instalment on their Rolls Royees.
However, if the sales didn’t compare with
a Basement Bargain morning, the brush
sisterhood ran the afternoon party of the
week. The Education Gallery saw its
crowded hour of glorious strife when polite-
ness waged and won tiie war against wearied
legs, so that no undue scramble was made
for the two last chairs placed by a lonely
male before the standing battalions. Of
course the early-comers had seats, but the
merely punctual and the late arrivals stood
at unease or sat along the edge of the plat-
form while Mrs. Holman implored them not
to allow the National Gallery to become
another of the great empty spaces of Aus-
tralia. She_ also urged a movement for
Higher Art in almanacs and colored supple-
ments. At least this Letter presumed that
was the inner meaning of her appeal for
better pictures in baby’s bedroom. The host-
esses for the afternoon were the auxiliary
committee of the society, of which Mrs.
Architect Taylor is the president, and whose
vice-presidents include Lady Poynter, Dame
Mary Hughes and Mrs. Holman. Music and
tea-drinking sped the short winter afternoon,
and the guests emerged from the Education
Gallery to a city over which a thin, haze-
like smoke drifted, and an evening star, like
some blazing jewel, swung as it were on an
invisible chain between the earth and the
deep blue of the Heavens.
Maybe the row that had burst over the
Student and his Songs was responsible for
the almost frigid decorum that ruled over the
early stages of the Uni. Sports Union dinner-
dance. It was not till the cliampagne-cup
and chanty stage was reached that mirth
came to abide amid the revels. G. G. Hill
was the capable secretary of a committee
made up entirely of men, among whom were
president of the Sports Union Treatt and
H. M. Saxby, the massive ex-president of
the Undergrads.’ Association. Priminister
Stanley Bruce stepped blithely into the arena
of youth about midnight, convoying Captain
and Mrs. Ferrers Guy and attractive Mary
Langtree. The girls at the dance were
numerous and costly, and the little dinner-
jacket punctuated the more feminine allure
of the spreading early-Victorian style. Lois
Windeyer wore a severely-cut dinner-suit in
black satin, while Elizabeth Bligh exempli-
fied the vogue of the 1830’s in black taffetas.
Bright-faced Rosemary Shepherd mixed
white georgette and black velvet in her dash-
ing little coat and skirt. Adrian Gurlewis
carved a duck in honor of his newly-
betrothed, Betty Carr, who looked positively
toothsome in a shimmer of pale pink sequins
crusted on pink chiffons; and Brian Win-
deyer squired his best girl, Joyce Russell,
who wore black satin. Rhodes Scholar John
Flynn was another of the pointed-outs, and
the Mungo MacCallums occupied the seats
of the mighty.
Gwen Varley, the alert and bright-cheeked
secretary for Girls’ Week, is the subject of
this picture.
Gwen’s big ob-
ject in life
since she left
he r Welfare
job at Far-
mer’s is the
City Girls’
Amateur
Sports Asso-
ciation, of
which she is
secretary, and
her enthusiasm
had quite a lot
to do with
kindling the
desire in the
m e m b e r s’
hearts for a
playing - field
of their very
own. A round
£15,000 will
buy and equip
it, and the main object of Girls’ Week is
the raising of this amount. For two shil-
lings a year any girl in factory, office, shop
or domestic-service can become a member of
the association. For twopence a month she
can have healthy companionship with girls
of her own years. And with perseverance
she can excel in all the sports necessary to
the career of a movie star.
New red carpets on all the aisles in the
Town Hall and a new line in electric fit-
tings (the latter probably due to Mayor
Mostyn’s professional pride) caused a wave
of excitement to run through the. audience
gathered on Saturday for the Heifetz con-
cert. The subject of the carpets was dis-
cussed in divers tongues and tones till the
entrance of Dame Nellie Melba and the vice-
regal. Unfortunately for the Dame, her
entry on the left clashed with that of the
Government House party on the right, so
she received only one clap. But she had a
special place all to herself in the front line,
with a little table blooming with a bouquet
of roses right under her nose. Lady de
Chair and her party sat three rows further
back—the vice-res. don’t relish the draught
that sweeps along the front of the stage.
After Melba, in her Parma violet satin
topped by a silver coat, had seized her roses
and whispered to her male escort and a fair-
haired, primrose-enwrapped young thing on
her other side, and Lady de Chair, in a
black-and-silver wrought cloak, had throned
herself in the midst of her aides and her
friends, among whom was graceful Dagmar
Thomson, a fiddler in her own right, Heifetz
came out. Daniel making his bow to the
lions didn’t meet a louder roar of welcome.
The bland young man tossed it off with a
“Same to you and many of them” sort of
salute. At the close of the opening sonata
by Acliron Melba uttered a deeply resonant
brava, and she continued to ejaculate this
during the first two sections of the pro-
gramme. . But her great moment came when
two attendants hove in sight with a mon-
strous wreath of bays, on which “From
Melba to Heifetz” was emblazoned in letters
to catch the eye of the back row of the gal-
lery. When the toilers of the City Hall
finally got the bays into position Melba tripped
forward, and with one Amazonian effort
swung the horticulture at the feet of the
young Russ. With his quick and still rather
shy smile. Jascha bent from the hips in the
sort of how that is the despair of the
English and kissed the diva’s hand. At that
moment there was a terrific flash, and this
Letter isn’t sure yet whether it was a flash-
light photograph or Dame Nellie’s rings.
Seventeen homes, not all in a row and not
all in the one street, but in Bankstown.
Bondi, Coogee,
M err y lands
and half a
dozen other
suburbs —that
is the achieve
ment of the
V o 1 u n t ary
W o r k e r s’
Cafe, started
at the instiga-
tion of the de-
voted lady in
the picture. A
week or so ago
the title-deeds
of the cottages
were handed
to the disabled
soldiers an d
war widows
who have been
their tenants
for years past
at a nominal rent of os. a week. It was
in the very early days of the war that Mrs.
Greatorex —she’s the lady—had the idea of
running a cafe with voluntary labor as a
sort of complement to Dr. Arthur’s volun-
tary workers’ organisation. The first cafe
was on the site of the London Bank in
Martin-place, and the premises were the
property of that bank. The sweetest music
Mrs. Greatorex says she has ever heard was
when Mr. Millett, the bank manager, told
her he had put the matter to his board, and
not only could the Voluntary Workers have
the building, but there’d be no rent to pay.
To get the first instalments on the furniture
a group of the Workers ran a stall in
Martin-place, where they sold anything they
had already got for nothing. Such a system
of finance in such hands was bound to
succeed, and the cafe simply coined money
both at its first address and later in Eliza-
betli-street. Two of the most devoted of
the little band died before the completion
of the task —Mrs. W. F. Corbett and Mrs.
Bisset Amess. But a group of trustees,
among whom are Mrs. Harry Simpson, Mrs.
G. McMillan and Mrs. J. Samuel, has
rounded off the work, and with one gesture
handed out nearly £12,000 on the presenta-
tion evening. The cafe was the first of its
kind in Sydney. Since it opened its_ doors,
like establishments have sprung up in con-
nection with almost every charity.
The curate’s lot can hardly be a happy
ohe these days when a minister’s widow is
faced with the fate of the six ladies men-
tioned by .Canon Charlton at the annual
meeting of the Homo Mission Union. They
are the widows of Anglican ministers who
gave their energies, their health and the
education which they could have sold in the
business world for a cosy income, sables and
a diamond necklet for their wives. The
wives, on their part, probably worked like
slaves in the interests of their husbands’
parishes, and now they are left with some-
thing like 2s. lOd. a day between them and
the wolf at the door. Canon Charlton made
an appeal for £3OOO. This invested would
bring them in another weekly 12s. 6d. each.
Australians pride themselves on their gener-
osity ; and although the appeal was made to
the Home Mission Union, the Canon will not
thunder denunciations against outside help.
Two of Hobart's best-known young people,
Eileen Chancellor and Captain Eric Stopp,
crossed the Strait to find a smithy to forge
their matrimonial gyves. St. Mark’s at
Darling Point meeting all requirements, the
two were made one on Monday. The Captain,
who is an Adelaide native, has lately been
appointed private secretary to the Adminis-
trator of Norfolk Island, and the newly-
weds will come to a home-camp there after
a honeymoon dash in the Mountains. For
Tassy sisters who have been quite wrought
up about this engagement, this Letter took
note of a wedding-dress of blusli-pink lace
over georgette, a becoming pale pink hat. and
a bouquet of pink orchids that completed
the bride’s outfit when . father armed his
daughter up St. Mark’s, and sister Joyce
in delphinium blues followed demurely. Mrs.
Chancellor and Mrs. R. C. Stopp added black
and green and black and gold trimmings
to the pews during the vow exchange.
Moira Brady, the pretty blonde daughter
of the medical A. J. Bradys, is the cause
behind the permanent smile that is being
worn by Captain Broadhurst, one of the
Governor-General’s aides. The engagement
of the pair has released a flood of congratu-
lations, for Moira is as popular as she is
pretty.
Susanne Helder, of Lane Cove, golden-
haired and blue-eyed, was one of the pret-
tiest brides who ever exchanged vows at
St. James’s. Her lucky bridegroom was Dr
Stewart Oag. The celebration was later
held at the Ambassadors, where Millions
Clubman D. K. Inglis made the flowery
speech of the evening in praise of the bride.
But the young man who staggered the house
was one who uttered a prophecy concerning
Mr. Mares, the weather prophet. Mr. Mares
according to the young man, had threatened
every sort, of bad weather short of three
feet of snow for the evening: and behold
the evening was flawless! “You’ll be glad
to learn,” said the young man, “that Mr.
Mares is aboflt to give up his weather-job
and is taking one at Farmers —to make
bloomers.”
The fashion of taking a moving picture of
the arriving magnates at the Prince Edward
on the opening night of a new picture was
again in force for the first showing of “Old
Ironsides.” But last Friday, as always, what
one might term the perennial deadheads were
the notabilities picked out by the flicker man.
Instead of showing theatricals and poli-
ticians, why not give good old General
Public —who, after all, pays for liis seat —-a
thrill by seeing himself, his wife and his
daughter walking across the foyer and up
the marble steps? If this Letter ran a movie
palace he who paid would always get snapped.
Heifetz was probably the most distinguished
personality at the mixture of buccaneering
and romance, and with him sat E. J. Tait’s
two daughters. Elaine de Chair was another
front-seater. Dan Carroll brought a swish
party, among them Heifetz’s accompanist.
Isidore Acliron.
Mrs. Norman Aronson, one of the most
consistent workers for St. Margaret’s, was
farewelled by that hospital's committee,
under the shepherding of Mrs. George Fitz-
Patrick. The tea-drinking took place at the
Ambassadors, where a leather travelling-bag
was presented to the guest, who next week
sails for Europe.
Newly-returned Mark Sheldon's lady gavi
herself just time to pull on one of her new
Paris hats before taking up her interest in
Santa Sophia College for R.C. women. The
committee staged a party to her glory in
the handsome building itself. Last week
she and her daughters were among those
who arranged parties for the bridge after
noon held in Mrs. Toohey's flat at St.
Monica’s in the interest of the building fund.
The party was a great success, and Mis-
Egan, who attended to the arrangements,
had nearly 100 guests in her care. Incident-
ally, the youngest Sheldon girl is the on"
to whom uncle Tom Dalton left something
like £30,000.
Stage people are usually economical in
the matter of babies, but the members of
the Renee Kelly company reckon themselves
as godfathers and godmothers to an
Australian-born infant. The mother is Peggy
Willoughby, who came from England two
years ago to fulfil a long-standing engage-
ment at the altar with Ronald Ward, and
was subsequently with the Renee Kelly co.
She is with that co. now; but the arrival
of young Irene Ward caused a period of
absence. As the maternal grandma has taken
the infant to England with her, it is evident
that the Wards do not intend to emulate
other imported actors who, once in Aus-
tralia, can’t induce themselves to leave if-
On Thursday the Wentworth will blaze
with decorations when the braves of the
United Service Club appear in their war-
paint at the Institute’s yearly corroboree.
The presence of the Governor-General and
his- lady will cast ,vice-regal glamor over
the social baptism of a group of debs. Presi-
dent Colonel Alfred Spain will do the honors
for his institute.

The superb quality of the gems selected for use in
Drummond's Rinfts contributes in no small decree to
their distinctive appearance, but it requires the
masterly skill of the firm's experts to impart that
added exclusiveness that has always been associated
with their Diamond and Gem Ri lifts. Both the quality
and the distinctiveness of the Rinfts illustrated can
best be appreciated by a personal inspection.
A discount of five per cent, is allowed

Chatter
The Victoria Golf Club, which used to
chase the little white ball at Fishermens
Bend, gave a lunch when it took possession
of its new links at Cheltenham, guests
assembling in the £30,000 club-house. The
pavilion is a most elaborate affair, with 14
bedrooms. The card-rooms and lounges are
connected by folding doors, so that space
can be made for at least 700 dancers —-the
club membership at present is 630, of whom
130 are women. A line view of Port Phillip
is one of the attractions' of the new quarters.
S. M. Bruce was the big gun who drove off
from the first tee and declared the links
open; and Mrs. Bruce, in sports attire of
black and white, was one of the players.
President Baillieu, with his daughters, Mrs.
R. Ramsay and Amy, received and enter-
tained the guests, who included the office-
bearers of the V.G.A.
W. Bankes Amery, who keeps an eye on
migration for the British Government, held
a sort of three-in-one jollo at the Windsor
on Friday night—dinner, a theatre-party. for
“The Ringer” and a supper-dance. The idea
was to enable members of the Migration and
Development Commission to fraternise with
leading workers of various organisations
interested in migration. The Mitchell
and Masson ladies helped to make the
guests acquainted. Tables were decorated
with baskets of carnations, with trails of
violets and autumn foliage wandering over
the damask. The ladies’ places were marked
with shoulder-posies and boxes of chocolates,
and theatre tickets and programmes were
handy. Taxis waited before and after the
show. Some of the bidden were IT. W. Gepp
and his wife, James Barrett and his lady,
David Masson, J. Gunn, C. P. Fleming. Pro-
fessor Gunn and his life-partner and Mary
Mitchell.
The English-Speaking Union entertained
the lads of the training-ship Wangaratta at
The Palms, newly-established on the lawns
of Henley. Secretary Richard Gipps and
his wife were the moving spirits, she having
grey-blue georgette clinging to flowered bro-
cade apparel. Mrs. W. B. Adamson, in a
confection of glittering beads and sequins, of
amethyst hues, brought her dainty chick
Hester, clothed in almond-green with touches
of gold. Marie, daughter of E.S.U.-president
Donald Mackinnon, was in black. Audrey
Osborne, not yet become a land-girl, wore
a frock of figured chiffon taffeta of pastel
tone.
Justice Duffy and his wife mourn the
death of their only daughter, Mary, which
happened very suddenly. Miss Duffy, who
was her father’s associate, was spending a
few days’ holiday at her brother Brendan’s
home in Albury. A cold started it, and
she became so ill that her parents, who were
on their way to the Canberra opening, were
recalled at Goulburn, returning to find then-
daughter’s case hopeless. Many friends
regret the passing of a good pal. Miss
Duffy was a keen motorist, but found little
pleasure in the social round.
Though dress-designers here insist that
their clients’ skirt-hems must brush their
knee-bones, travellers who have seen the
latest styles displayed in mannequin parades
abroad tell us that the very abbreviated
frock is out of fashion. In Paris very little
jewellery is now seen, and the still-current
Melbourne fashion of wearing numerous
ropes of pearls has been abandoned in Europe
for the older fashion of the single string.
One of our most thoughtful dressers —a
man, at that —has brought back from Eon-
don the latest conceit, handkerchief and tie
fashioned of the same figured and bordered
material. Some very fascinating color effects
are being displayed by this gentleman.
A more elaborate programme than usual
was furnished at last week’s soiree of the
Alliance Frangaise. Consul Rene Turek
talked briefly and rapidly of the Pacific
adventurings of La Perouse and Cook. In
apparel of petunia-pink tone Eileen Thomson
warbled little French songs, showing much
promise. Besides being accompanist, Maisie
Thomson, who was in green silk, played
Debussy and Chopin. Madame Cockerfon
presented well-posed and excellently-costumed
tableaux vivants that depicted La Perouse.
Madame Vigee-Lebrun. Madame Recamier
and Balzac. The allegorical group of
“France Surrounded by Her Colonies,”
which adorns the medal presented by the
parent body in France for special service to
the nation, was a grand finale. After the
coffee-cups were handed round, there was
dancing.
A sprig of heather mingled with the
orange-buds amid the antique Brussels lace
that swathed the ivory-white bridal raiment
of Elspeth, younger daughter of the J. AV.
Robertson couple of Camberwell, when she
took Dr. Norman J. Parker as her husband.
Queen’s Chapel, at the Uni., was the foundry
where the links were forged. Wearing frocks
of apricot and silver gleams of taffeta, topped
by large tulle millinery to blend, Sheila
Robertson and Jean Fraser Smith attended
the bride. Little Kaye Mitchell guarded the
filmy lace train.
Edie Ramsay, third daughter of the late
Angus Urquhart, has passed into the annexed
area. The successful selector is C. E. McCar-
del. only son of the late Dr. C. J. McCardel
and Mrs. Lister, of Ardeck. His bride-to-be
lives with her mother at Camperdown.
Jeanette Barrett, youngest daughter of
James Barrett and his lady, is gathering up
a trousseau for her nuptials with B. H.
Marks on June 1. Billie Herman helped
the bride-elect to furnish her linen-chest by
bidding friends to a gift-tea last week, when
the Morell lady handed over her Toorak
home for the gathering. Daughter Sheila
graced the function in covering of biscuit
hue, and the guest-of-lionor was prettily clad
in mushroom-pink.
The Business and Professional Women’s
Club had its monthly dinner at the Rivob
one night last week, when Dr. Georgina
Sweet talked about trade with the Orient.
A confirmed traveller herself, she advocated
travel as a very good way of preserving
peace. But unfortunately the recipe can t
be very generally applied, and when the
wrong people do it. there may be the Devil
to pay. The Borodin woman in China, for
instance.
Rupertswood at Sunbury, one of Austra-
lia’s historic country mansions, is going to
change hands. Rupert Clarke, when he suc-
ceeded to the baronetcy, sold the place to
brother Russell, who in turn sold to H. v.
McKay, of Sunshine Harvester fame. Now
it’s going to be an agriculural college, having-
been purchased by a religious order, the Sale-
si'an Brothers, for that purpose.
The Heliotherapy Children’s Hospital, at
Frankston, got unexpected monetary help
last week by a cheque for £2500 from knight
AV. G. Mcßeath and his son, to provide an
operating- and X-ray-block. This valuable
addition to the institution will bear the
name of Marion Nancy Mcßeath.
This is Mrs. J. G. Desaiily, wife of the
medical head of Camperdown Hospital. The
lady was in
Melbourne
for the royal
visit, bur she’s
a confirmed
Camperdonian,
and takes a
hand in so
many benevo-
lent m ove-
ments tlic r e
t, h a t her
daughter has
to act as her
secretary. Her
war - work
was so out-
standing that
she was pre-
sented with a
brooch bearing
the word
“Charity” in
diamonds. She
was wearing
the gift when the Broothorn camera
clicked. She is a life governor of Camper-
down Hospital, a member of the War Memo-
rial Committee and on the executive of the
Camperdown branch of the National Council
of Women. Mrs. Desaill.y is a lover of sport,
too, and lawn tennis players compete each
year for a cup that she provides.
Doctors and nursing-staff of the Chil-
dren’s Hospital had a night off on Saturday,
when they went a-dancing with some friends
at No. 9. The ministering angels laid aside
their uniforms for taffetas, georgette, tulle
and chiffon, and it was a great night. Alice
West, chief-engineer of the jollo, wore jade-
blue punctuated with bands of petunia tone.
Young lawyer Howlett. who went abroad
to iron the creases out of a tired mind, has
reached London after a saunter through un-
fashionable byways. He took passage on a
Finnish oil steamer that was tramping round
the world, and was months afloat, reaching
Finland in the pink of condition.
The Sierra assists with an exodus of the
Caddy family. Dr. Caddy is taking son John,
via America, to his future moorings at Wool-
wich, where he will inquire into the interior
workings of armaments and such. Mrs.
Arnold Caddy and Betty will accompany them
as far as Honolulu.
The Raynes Dicksons are sending their
son across the world with strict injunctions
to bring back sister Betty, who has been
pleasure-hunting abroad since St. Catherines
turned her loose as a finished product some
two years back. As in all that time the
young lady has been too booked-up. to make
her bow to royalty she is to be given tune
to repair this omission, so for a while young
Haynes will be able to shake a free limb
in Fogtown.
Margot Best will be an experienced trav-
eller when the Berrys restore her to her
father at the end of this year. The party
lived on the shores of Lake Michigan,
motored through California, and were guests
in many American homes. By the time
Margot returns sister Phyllis will be spread-
ing her wings to search for fame and pro-
fessional experience where so many clever
young Australians seek it —abroad.
Mollie Locke, pictured here, is one of the
brightest members of the Beresford Fowler
co. For some
years slic has
been known
as an enter-
tainer songs
at the piano
and mono-
logues and so
fort h. She
dabbled in
melodrama for
a while ou
tour with the
Anderson co.,
and about a
year'ago visit-
ed England,
where she be-
came a mem-
ber of the
B i r m ingham
Repertory
Thea t r e
Society, and
p 1 a y c d Mrs.
Borkman in Ibsen's “John Gabriel Bork-
man,” Since her return to Melbourne she
has been seen in Ibsen, Galsworthy and
Shaw plays, and was the star in a recent
performance of “The Seagull.” Her next
appearance is to be as Liza Doolittle (the
flower-seller who became a lady) in Shaw’s
“Pygmalion.”
Marie Bernadou, a returned traveller,
stepped off the beaten track in Europe to
see places and people but little known. In
a little corner astride the Pyrenees she
fraternised with the Basques, having an
uncle-by-marriage among the tribe, and _ the
folk who claim descent from the Phoenicians
made her heartily welcome. Miss Bernadou,
who is on the staff of the Coburg High
School, spent some of her time studying
educational methods at the Institute Jean
Jacques Rousseau at Geneva.
Constance Laver, who was a valiant war-
worker, is rejoicing because the Yorks have
been pleased to accept copies of her book
“Extracts from My Diary.” She is still hard
at it on behalf of disabled Diggers.
The staff of the London and Lancashire
Insurance Co. said au revoir to Arthur E.
Wall, who returns to the Big Smoke to be-
come assistant-manager. B. Finnigan, Mel-
bourne manager, and his wife were host and
hostess at No. 9, and there was jazz, bridge
and chatter. The hostess was in cyclamen-
colored georgette linked to ecru lace. Mrs.
Wall, who carried a presentation posy, was
in black lace, and daughter Joy was pleasing
to the eye in a harmony of gold lace and
rose-tinted chiffon.
Mrs. Rupert de Burgh Ker (Phyllis Lett
on the concert stage) caught qpid during
her tour of Maoriland, and has been very
ill since. Though far from convalescence,
she left last week with her husband and
small daughter for their station-home in
Queensland, to enjoy some recuperating
warmth and sunshine. Miss Maude Burdett
accompanied them. She returns to England
by way of South Africa about the middle
of July.
The tally-ho season is upon us, and finds
the countryside a bit too dry for comfort.
The packs are being exercised, and the
horn will call members of the four hunt
clubs together very soon for the opening
meet. Melbourne wearers of the scarlet had
a preliminary run at the end of the week
over the parched country, and report good
hunting.
Mrs. Norman Brookes, who watches over
the welfare of the Queen Victoria Hospital
for Women, has sent out an SOS for sup-
plies of linen of all kinds. A general collec-
tion will take place at Scott’s Hotel on .Tune
7, when there will be tea, and stalls of
flowers and sweets. Mrs. W. M. Robins and
Mrs. W. B. Carnegie are arranging for
entertainers to enliven the tea-drinking hour
of those who bring gifts from the in un-
dies ter department. It will take a big pile
of sheets, blankets and pillow-cases to re-
commission the 72 beds occupied by patients,
to say nothing of the requirements of the
nursing and domestic staffs. P.S. —Friends
need not wmit until the tea-drinking to hand
in their gifts.
At the latest of the readings arranged
by Carrie Haase Hilda Stevens dipped
into the works of brother Alexandei.
The room was tilled with shadows of the
closing day, and the only light was that
from the green-shaded lamp whose rays fell
upon the pages of the reader's book. Appro-
priate, therefore, was the warbling by Miss
Malyon of the poet's verses “In the Half-
Light,” set t 6 music by an overseas composer,
to which Mona Mcßurney played an accom-
paniment.
The British Music Society’s second tri-
bute to Beetlidven was noteworthy. The
Lamberts, father and son, were wholly in
sympathy in the “Kivutzer,” and Louise
Gargurevicli gave a skilful performance of
tlie pianoforte Sonata in E Major. Tin
programme closed with the Sonata in A Flat
for piano and ’cello, played by Gwen Prock-
ter and her mother.
Though Paderewski was just across the
street, the Assembly Hall enticed a large
audience to listen to the Melbourne string
quartette and pianist Edward Goll. Under
Bernard Heinze’s leadership the four tiddlers
gave the Mozart quartette in D and Schu-
bert’s “Death and the Maiden,” both good
in parts. With Mr. Goll’s aid. a Cesar
Franck quintette was essayed, with a lot of
success.
Violet Somerset, with a ripple of diamente
on a gown of roseate hue, was heard at the
Assembly Hall the other night in songs by
French composers, Liszt’s “Mignon,” and
some English lyrics, and the contralto made
a very good impression. William Burrell
proved himself a sympathetic accompanist.
Katie Liddle, the pianiste, shared the hon-
ors, wearing cyclamen pink with sparkling
adornment. Chopin, Schumann, Brahms and
some more modern composers were drawn
upon. There were regular stacks of flowers
for the performers.
Art shows are so plentiful just now that
there is a regular glut of portraits, land-
scapes and still-life pieces. A collection of
French work, mainly of inferior quality but
nicely set up in quaint frames and low-
priced, sold well lately, but there has been
a lull in buying since. Vida Lahey’s show,
which closed on Saturday, didn’t get the
attention it merited. This Queensland artist
exhibited at least one study that deserved a
place in our gallery. Her next show is to b :
in Adelaide. To-day the Athenaeum Gallery
wall be hung with the canvases of 11. Septi-
mus Power, and Governor Somers will say
the opening words. Herbert It. Gallop's
oils are enlisting notice this week at the
Sedon Galleries.
Until the 28tli the Institute of Arts and
Literature will give room to an exhibition
of flower-paintings in water-color by Miss
A. E. Oakley, combined with Mrs. M. Wal-
soe’s sea-and-landscapes in the same medium
and the same artist's pottery and sculpture.
A feature of Mrs. Walsoe’s chinaware is
the lovely blue she has obtained.
The Operatic Society accumulated financial
support for its August production of “Floro-
dora” by a dance and bridge party held at
Mrs. Norman Churton’s Toorak home on
Saturday night! The hostess was present
in a gown of periwinkle blue. Frances Lea,
who headed the committee of conveners', had
a border of feather trimming to her raiment
of shell-pink. Dr. Fleming Dunstan’s wife
danced in flounces of peach-pink georgette
allied to a bodice of taffeta. Bernard Col-
man secretaried the function, which had
good patronage. Some selections from Les-
lie Stuart’s most successful comic opera were
cheery interludes of the evening.
To celebrate the first Australian birthday
of “Bose Marie,” which falls on Monday,
there will be gay doings at His Majesty's,
and decorators will hang up draperies and
garlands. A birthday cake of large dimen-
sions will be cut by Harriet Ben net after
the performance, and boxes containing por-
tions of the cake will be given to patrons
as souvenirs.
A few lines from Darwin (N.T.) :
Three marriages in two days is Darwin’s latest
record. Doris Witte and Wesley Lucas said their
vows in the Methodist Church one night; and on the
next the church was again crowded to see Dorothy
Watkin, of Port Augusta, keep her troth with Harold
Hilditch, well known on the football held. On the
same night, at the R.C. Church, Olive Wickham and
Her.ry Farrar, both of Darwin, were made a pair.
Gordon Marsh, a well-known Territorian, lias
induced Hilda Fincham, a Queensland girl who
was for a. while on the staff of Darwin Hospital, to
accept an engagement-ring.
The Victoria League’s first social evening of the
year introduced the new president, Mrs. R. 11.
Weddell, to members. There was music, supper
and dancing and plenty of chatter, the weather being
cool enough to make all four enjoyable. Mrs. Wed-
dell’s sister, Miss McDonald, who is spending a. few
months with her, was there.
The Town Council elections in June promise to
be exciting. It’s expected there’ll be no lack of
candidates, and two women, residents here for some
years, are likely to take the hustings. It’s a
change from previous years, when Town Council
elections were usually walk overs and the Government
had to fill seats that nobody wanted.

Nell Douglas-Graham did up the platform
in All Saints’ Hall with red poinsettia to
show that, Charles Dickens's memory is
kept green in Brisbane. Gladys Peake was
at the piano. Patricia McGregor was very
sweet, in a scene from “Nicholas Niekleby,”
and Dorothy Webster made a vivacious Miss
lvuagg; but the hit of the evening was Mr.
Bumble’s courtship, in which Nell Douglas-
Graham and E. J. Brown took the principal
parts. The Lieut. Governor and Mrs.
Lennon were there.
When Evelyn Barry, daughter of the T. ,1.
Barrys, Greenslopes, said "I will” to Tom
Gamin, at St. Stephen’s, she wore ivory,
broidered in opalescent sequins and crystal,
a veil of Brussels lace and a circlet of orange
blossoms. She carried Eucharist lilies and
rosebuds. Joan Barry held up the court-
train of ivory chiffon, her frock being pink
chiffon. Alma Barry, Elsie Roberts, Hilda
Forth and Madeline Barry 'maided in •cameo
pink, with silver sequins and close-fitting
caps of rose velvet, with pink tulle veils.
They carried posies of La France roses.
There has been a good deal of talk about
the arch erected by the carpenters and build-
ers in front of the old Town Hall to honor
the Yorks. Those who put it there did not
see their way to take it down again, and
the motorists who make Queen-street a risky
footway have been cursing it pleasantly and
unpleasantly. Mayor Jolly promised that
something should be done, and there is hope
now that the thing will go, though it has been
suggested that it might as well be left to
welcome the new Governor in June.
The Old Girls had their annual dance
at Somerville House. Pink flowers and
asparagus fern decorated, with streamers of
mauve and pink, and in the supper-room
were the taAvny golds and warm reds of
autumn. There Avas a tremendous roll-up
of O.G.'s.
Mayor Jolly, avlio will surely deserve a
halo if lie doesn’t get a statue, has his eye
on St. Helena as a health resort and seaside-
holiday spot for Brisbaneites. Shade trees
are to be planted, and a toAvn planned over
the site of ancient sin and sorrow. The
City Council will take command.
Poetess Emily Bulcock’s dainty daughter
Marjorie has been awarded the McDermott
prize (given for the first time ibis year)
to the Best Honors Graduate at Queens-
land Uni. Marjorie took her B.A. with
honors in languages and literature.
Roses and chrysanthemums adorned the
supper-tables for the first dance given this
season at the Hamilton Golf Club. St. Lois
College, at the Uni., had their dance set in
green and white. At the Hockey Club dance,
at All Saints’ Hall, there was a big muster.
We are to have a. new theatre soon, with
seating for 2000. It will run through from
Queen-street to Elizabeth-street, and be fitted
with a lounge and various comforts.
WESTRALIA.
Perth.
Our brightest western sunshine flooded
Fremantle Harbor Avlien the Renown made
herself comfortable there, and the Yorks got
their first glimpse of the Large Lone State
under ideal conditions. It’s 12 miles from
port to Perth, and the route was lengthened
a little so as to get in as many of the
prettiest glimpses as possible. Everywhere
the road had a human lining, and a flutter of
bunting, too. Perth’s Mayor Franklin was
waiting at the King’s Park gates with a
loyal address, backed by an array of leading
citizens, and Mrs. Franklin had an armful
of our best roses for Duchess Betty.
Next day, after spending the night at
Government House, the guests were given
an outing in the country. Some institutions
and the Fail-bridge Farm School Avere visited,
but there weren’t any very formal doings.
After that breather we held a great corro-
boree in King’s Park on the Saturday, when
the schools and all the sorts of Scouts and
Guides Avere paraded and did a living map
of Australia, and 10.000 citizens filed past
the dais to catch a royal eye.
This is Lafayette’s portrait of ilary
Meares, who amid shouts of “Good boy,
Mary,” received
a gold medal
on Anzac Day.
The R.S.S.L.
gave the trin-
ket in recogni-
tion of the fine
work she has
done during
and since the
Avar. She is
secretary o f
the Red Cross
V.A.D.’s, vice-
president o f
the Ladies’
Return e d
Maimed and
Limbless Aux-
iliary. and on
the executive
committee o f
the Military
Nurses’ Home.
She devotes
three evenings a week to what she calls “my
boys,” designs and traces their fancy-work,
plays bridge with them, Avaits at the tables
of incapacitated heroes, and sees that they
get to races and sports matches. All her
soldier jobs are honorary. She earns a crust
as secretary of the Repertory Club.
The Margarets of England are raising
£7OO for the building of a hostel in the
Group Settlement of Margaret, near Bussel-
ton. There will be a mothers’ rest-room,
and wards where little Aussics whose
parents till the soil of the district can have
their first howl and peep of daylight. Dame
Margaret Cecil, who visited this country
last year with the Empire Press Delega-
tion, set the ball rolling when she got home.
The Green Room club-rooms, decked in
chrysanthemums, housed a recent dance.
The Wittenoom lady wore lilac and silver
under her befringed evening wrap of a simi-
lar tone. Tall Kitty Gillies chose black
georgette threaded in silver and Anita Fitz-
gerald powder-blue and gold. Mrs. Arthur
Francis was in two-toned cherry, and Mrs.
Burgoyne’s dark head gleamed above a shim-
mery gown of rose-tinted sequins.
Gilbert and Sullivan operas are spending
a tuneful season here. Strella Wilson and
our own Mabel Gibson and Lilian Crisp lift
their melodious voices in the familiar airs
and wear their clothes gracefully.
Walter James’s lady and Senator Kings-
miH’s wife hastened with their husbands
from the Canberra festivities to flag-decked
Perth to join in the gay welcome to the
Visitors.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
The week has given us a couple of sub-
scription dances, one at Glenelg, in the
Maison de Dance, organised by a local com-
mittee to help build the new R.C. church,
and the other in the Burnside Hall in aid
of that suburb’s School for Mothers. The
latter dance is an annual affair, usually run
by the younger set, and this year’s frivol,
with Mrs. Arthur Laughton as organiser-in-
chief, was one of the best.
Concerts have been given by the Orpheus
Society and the Elder Conservatorium
students. Marjorie Walsh and Dorothy Bel-
cher were among the younger singers from
the Con. who gave a good account of them-
selves. The Orpheus Society, under J. M.
Dunn, had as soloists Aileen Newly n, Grace
Cussin and Ray Wood, and encores nearly
doubled the programme. Folksingers and
dancers launched their season with a seance
at the Masonic Hall, where there was music,
a presidential word or two from Mr. Carey,
and much dancing. Devotees of the revived
arts are fresh from a “summer school” at
Mount Barker —successful enough as an affair
feminine, but man is a shy bird, and only
one of the species could be induced to go.
The English-Speaking Union assembled its
members to welcome the Angas Parsons
couple. Music, supper and a speech from
the male guest of the evening tilled a pro-
gramme whose only minor note Avas one of
regret for the illness of the secretary, Miss
Johnston.
A hundred tables were booked for bridge in
the Town Hall in aid of the hospital auxiliary,
and Frank Moulden was in attendance to
present prizes in his lady’s place.
The eternal feminine bulks large in the
Arts and Crafts School exhibition, as teacher
and exhibitor. Gladys Good’s china painting
pupils show imagination as well as crafts-
manship, and there are admirable woodblocks
from the disciples of Mary Harris. There
is an exhibition of paintings at the Society
of Arts rooms, too, oils of the earlier and
water-colors of the later period of James

of putty and henna, was one of Mrs. Ben-
son's luncheon guests at the Port Adelaide
Racing Club’s meeting at Cheltenham. Her
daughter was with her and Mrs. Gerald
Armstrong, and other guests were Mrs. E. W.
Morris and her daughter (the latter billed
as Queen Elizabeth in the Empire Pageant),
Mrs. W. J. Masson and Mrs. A. F. Lynch.

His Ex. arrived back from Canberra in
time to be present at the Repertory The-
atre performance, when Galsworthy’s “Loy-
alties” Avas given to an absolutely packed
house. The next play is to be Shaw’s "Pyg-
malion.”
The Training College had its 21st birthday
recently, and Premier Lyons and Principal
Johnson talked amusingly about its and
their early struggles. Mrs. Lyons and
Education Minister Ogilvie’s wife were both
students in their younger days, and it was
recalled that the Premier’s better half won
a prize for a poem commemorating Scott’s
death in the Antarctic in 1913.
Most of our smart set turned up at the
Continental at the bidding of the Walter
Gellibrands for an at-home in honor of
Mrs. Battersliill (daughter of John Gelli-
brand and his lady), who has come from Cey-
lon on a visit. Contrary to the usual rule at
day-time affairs, plenty of men attended, and
there Avas dancing all the afternoon. The
chief attraction was the interpretation of
three of Chopin’s Preludes by the Russian 1
dancer, Mdlle. Michailovska. Elliott Lcavi's
and his lady, Margaret O'Grady, Mrs. R.
Morris (Ceylon), Miss Walsh (Brisbane)-
and a fair number of country guests were;
In the throng.
L. M. Shoobridge has come to the rescue
of women who have yearned to exhibit at
the Royal Agricultural Slioavs. but have been:
prevented by want of building accommoda-
tion. He has had a hall built in the grounds
at his own expense, and the other day ho:
formally presented the key, with a deed of
gift. Women who desire to do so may noAV
show their butter and cheese, cakes and
scones, needlework and the like. M. L. Moore
has consented to become organiser of the
women’s-work section.
The once-a-month reunion of British
migrants is now to be held in private homes
instead of at the Y.W.C.A., it being felt
that there is a more homely and hospitable
touch about it.
President’s Day at the Royal Hobart Golf
Club droAv a crowd across the water to
Rosny links. Avliere Alfred Ashbolt and his
lady shook hands with, and fed, a record
number of members and guests.
Chief Justice Nicholls and his lady made
a d&tour through Ballarat after the Can-
berra show, and were there given a 1 civic
welcome, that city being the home of the
C.J’s. ancestors, so to speak. R. IL Nicholls,
his father, was editor of the now-defunct
Ballarat Star before coming to Hobart to
run the Mercury.

6.V.8.: Country girl wlio adored school-
master for liis grammar evidently loved him for
tlie dangers lie had parsed.... J.T. (Ballarat) : Particu-
larly charmed with the sweet rhyme “books —moods.”

sigh that in life’s progress the horse “is no longer
in the van” sounds like a jest... .1.P.5.: Mere
word-wandering... .M.W.: Tale of profitable trans-
action too long for profit in print... .Visconti: It’s
a peaceful picture :—-

m that beach. .. .P.E.K.: You clothe the idea in
agged lines. . . .K,A.J.; Story too slight. .. .Verna W.;
Tcrbie’s love-making is wearisome... .M.R.N.: The
leginning of wisdom is not to write on both sides. .. .

arpentering too evident.... Bellerive: The Chow has
.iis speakee :—-
“Me havee bad hick,”
Said Ling to your humble,
“Alee same no good,
Would makee you grumble.

Brown’s advice, we've put it in the clink....
E.R.IL: Much obliged. All we can do is to see

but is rather stodgy.... Omah; 111-digested and
shrieky stuff.... Ignotus: Genuine instances of hard-
ship may arise, but as a rule they can be adjusted.
The object of the procedure is to meet cases where
the defendant is capable of complying with the
order of tin- Court but refuses to comply. It would
be difficult to find any equally effective substitute
by way of duress.

CORRESPONDENTS.

THE INKY WAY.
“11.E.C.” : F. T. Wimble, whose name is
a household word in Australasian printing
circles, lately celebrated the fifty-ninth anni-
versary of the day lie first made printing ink
in this country. Wimble, who is 80, started
his little factory at Baptist-lane, Melb., on
May 4, 1808. On the same day the Ramsden
Paper Mills produced the first paper made in
Australia. The Evening Stab of that date
told the story of the birth of two new indus-
tries, and used the first-fruits of both for
its issue.
“Makp”: In his mention of Maoriland
comic artists “Mlink” omitted Aucklander
Harry Rowntree, who very early discovered
that his own country offered no market for
his output and went off to London. A bril-
liant career was prophesied for Rowntree by
more than one of his school-teachers, and
his London success justified the predictions.
Cumberworth, now of Sydney, is also a
Maoriland product.
“Hamer”: One who knew many poets
passed with the death of Frederick Shen-
stone. As secretary to Angus and Robertson
he saw and bargained with most of them.
Having the figures at his finger-tips he could
assess their honor in their own country by
sales returns. He thought that Banjo Pater-
son was the most popular of Australian
versifiers, and he assured me that the un-
veiling of the Lawson Memorial at Cowra
and the accompanying publicity had not been
responsible for the shifting of a single copy
of Henry’s published works.
Charles Melton put up a startling long-
distance record this month, when he com-
pleted his sixty-ninth year of service on the
Brisbane Courier. The usual congratu-
lations were offered by staff and directorate,
but they must have come with an accus-
tomed flavor to the recipient. His first
experience of the sort was when lie topped
40 years’ service 20 years ago, and there
have been three or four celebrations since.
The old gentleman has been heard to hint
that he may think of calling it a day when
In; has rounded off his seventieth year on
the job.
What a lot of trouble some men do take
to earn a few shillings. A few weeks ago
there were landed in Australia thousands of
old, out-of-date copies of a paper published in
Glasgow and elsewhere in Scotland. Founded
in a very small way 12 years ago, it called
itself The Bulletin. It had a perfect right,
of course, to do that, but it hadn’t a perfect
or any other right to steal this paper's title-
heading. which it did—-the one that was
designed and drawn 40 years ago by William
Macleod. Since then, assisted by its piracy,
the Scotch paper has prospered, and editions
are published now at Edinburgh and Glas-
gow ; at the latter place it is incorporated
with the Scots Pictorial. It was the out-of-
date copies of this paper that have been
bought and shipped to Australia; and at
favorable opportunities runners are sent out
with bundles. Showing the familiar Bul-
letin title, they yell “Bulletin —Reduced
to a penny,” and have made great sale-.
Of course, the thing is an impudent fraud:
one glance at the purchase shows that what
has been bought is a Scotch paper bearing
a date back in 1925 or 1026- The Scotch
piracy hasn’t the familiar pink cover, other-
wise the success of the swindle might be
greater even than it has been.
“.T.H.” (Lond.) : Among London news-
papers the Northcliffe sheets are the most
prompt in paying outside contributors, and
for exclusive news stories they also pay
best. One Derby eve I got an exclusive
statement from the owner of the favorite
about his colt's prospects. There were no
more than three paragraphs, but the Mail
wanted the story to itself, and didn't argiu
about £2O. The same paper paid me £l5 for
a short article by Holman (about 4<>o
words) on the eve of the introduction of the
Betting Tax Bill. A fiver for an exclusive
news story on the boatrace or a big Rugby
international is nothing out of the way at
Carmelite House. The Times, Daily Tele-
graph and Morning T*ost pay monthly, and
require accounts to be sent in. The same
applies to the Daily News, Star, Datly
Chronicle, Daily Express, Daily Hki:-
ald and Westminster Gazette. Most
of the Liberal papers are rather
cheeseparing in their rates of IW'
ment, a disability they share with the
Times. Of tin* Sunday journals the
Observer pays best for accepted copy,
although Lord Riddell’s News of tiik
World is not niggardly for anything "UP
its street.” The Evening News norniallj
pays 10 to 12 guineas for feature stuff: <»•
its Saturday sporting page. When cricket
articles by leading Australian players aim
ex-players were all the rage last summer the
Daily Mirror offered £25 for an article or
1500 words. U was vain; the market Inn
been “cornered.”
INSPIRATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To e’en the most prosaically inclined
And sober-minded often comes a time
When frenzy seizes on them, aud they find
A yearning to express themselves in rhyme,
To woo the muse and with her to ascend
Into the brightest heaven of Invention,
To make their thoughts in natty couplets
blend
Becomes their hope—or, rather, their in-
tention.
We seek to steer our barque, when once is
fixed
Our port, as is too oft the tyro’s wont,
Through reefs of metaphors too richly mixed
With rhythms that are lame and rhymes
which don’t.
We blithely rush where poets fear to tread,
With execrable efforts, gay or solemn,
And wonder why it enters someone’s head
To quote us in the “correspondents’ ”
column.
And so I feel emboldened to suggest
If, in the still, dark watches of the night.
Excess of lobster lying on our chest
Or other reason, urges us to write,
Why, write ! and treat this homily with scorn!
Pursue your muse! Drain Inspiration’s
cup !
Then read it in the sober light of morn,
And, having read it —-tear the damn thing
up.

The big number at the fourth concert
given by Heifetz at Sydney Town Hall on
Saturday was a sonata by Joseph Achron,
a brother to the violinist’s accompanist. It
is a distinct acquisition to concert pro-
grammes, and the first Australian audience
to hear it was warmly responsive to its
beauties. Of course, it suffered nothing
under the bow of the tone-proof Heifetz.
Though something of that first fine rapture
that Sydney associated with the music of
the boy player five years ago has gone, still
to hear Heifetz in the works of Mozart,
Chopin and Paganini is to have an evening
so brimming with melody that it spills over
a whole week. Another work introduced by
the violinist was the fragment “Cortege” bv
Lili Boulanger. ‘
Tli.e amazing tribulations of Ethel Wayne
are the most striking feature of the magical
entertainment opened at Sydney St. James
Theatre on Saturday by Carter the Great.
The lady allows herself to be sawn in halves,
shot through the heart, hanged, elongated
until her hands and feet appear to be three
or four yards away from her still smiling
face, imprisoned in a box full of spikes, and
finally shot into nothingness—and all with
an air of quiet enjoyment. Carter is a mas-
ter of illusion, and, although his tricks have
been seen before in Sydney, most of them
MELBOURNE BIJOU.
George Wvrd, the Fuller Revue comedian.
remain as mystifying as ever. The gallows
net is as clever as the bit of surgery which
divides a young woman with such apparent
completeness, that the operator can walk
between the halves; until the trap-door of
the scaffold is drawn, and merely the dark
cloth that has covered the condemned young
woman hangs limp and empty, there is not
a member of the audience who would not be
prepared to swear that the lady was still
under the coyer. The performance is varied
by a seance in which the blindfolded Evelyn
Maxwell answers questions which people
write on slips of paper.
The signals.are clear for “The Ghost Train”
to rattle into Sydney Criterion Theatre
station on Saturday next. “Cradle Snat-
chers” will be shunted to the Palace, which
has been kept amused for the last week by
“Is. Zat So?” vine feature of the brief
revival was Bert Spargo’s appearance in the
part of the boxer-chauffeur; but Bert had
left; his best punch in the boxing game and
didn’t even look the part like the granite-
dialled pug who was his predecessor. The
“second edition” of.“ Sunny”—-the first has
lasted 12 weeks —provided the excuse for
a gala night at the Empire last Monday,
"hrasquita” was due to welcome back Ward
Morgan to stage-life at the lioyal last night
and to give him an enthusiastic reception
after his gratifying recovery from a terrible
accident. From the manner in which
“Madame Pompadour” is being mentioned as
an arrival on Saturday week, it seems likely
that “Frasquita’s” - nights are numbered.
"Tip Toes,” at Her Majesty’s, continues to
amuse as a compote of dancing events and
vaudeville comedy, with a thread of plot
almost invisible in places; and “Getting
Gertie’s Garter” has so appealed to Grand
Opera House patrons that the management
last week cut off free tickets at the meter.
On Saturday week (June 4) “The Sheik”
is to displace Carter at the St. James.
The revue company of which Stiffy and
Mo are distinguished ornaments found itself
“In Spain” last Saturday, and although
there was not much besides the title to sug-
gest the country of the Hildagos, the con-
glomeration of nonsense went as well as
usual. A pair of slick dancers, Iris and
Foley, are adding some new eclat to the pro-
ceedings at Fullers’ New Theatre, Sydney.
The little Playbox enthusiasts who have
been delivering “Business Is Business” every
Wednesday for some time make a change
next week; the Wednesday production is to
be Sean O’Casey’s “Juno and the Paycock.”
This much-discussed play would scarcely have
reached Sydney audiences so soon but for
Playbox enterprise.
“The Man Who Made the Queen Laugh”
sounds a doubtful tribute to her Majesty’s
sense of humor, but it is the crowning
achievement credited to Dick Henderson, the
chief of this week’s new arrivals at Sydney
Tivoli. Dispensing with grotesque clothes and
make-up, the comedian, after leading off with
a well-sung “straight” song, rattles off a
cascade of patter jests like a jocular machine-
gun. Elsie Bower and Billy Rutherford, a
pleasing enough comedy pair, make another
addition to a capital programme; two of the
Three Flacories show how near it is possible
to go to neck-breaking without doing it, and
the Lordens are back again in the same line
of business, sauced by comedy. But Hender-
son stands out. He is the sort of entertainer
who refreshes even the most blase.

“Old Ironsides,” at Sydney Prince Edward,
shows the beginnings of the American navy
going forth to rid the seas of Barbary cor-
sairs ; it is a reflection on the backwardness
of British producers that they have never
tried to show us the destruction of the
Emden by the Sydney at Cocos. The Ameri-
can film is merely more mass-production
from the Hollywood factory, but it is admir-
ably done. and the battle scenes are genu-
inely realistic. One picture, showing the
U.S. Constitution with every piece of
canvas on, is a perfect thing of beauty.
When she in Paris landed she lost the
right address, and so the girl was stranded
—imagine her distress! She couldn’t find
her hero; she’d lost her luggage, too; her
heart sank down to zero—what could the
poor thing do? She was by chance mis-
taken for a noble French princess. Sus-
picions did not waken —she wore so rich
a dress! But as she was retiring she got
an awful fright; she heard the prince inquir-
ing ; he’d come to stay the night! In the
bathroom swift she locked him; but troubles
grew and grew. Her presence never shocked
him —he was a lover, too! Came complica-
tions after, but why the need to say? The
picture’s full of laughter: ’twill while an
hour away at Sydney Lyceum and the Lyric
Open-air Art:—
M. J. McNally limns Australian scenery lovingly;
the thrill he clearly experiences in a charming 'and
colorful bit of it runs through to his fingertips in
a desire to make other eyes see through his. His
water-colors, shown in a small exhibition at the
Australian Pine Arts Gallery, Boomerang House, King-
street, Sydney, give the impression that each is a labor
of love. A fine appreciation of color is the marked
feature of the exhibition; and although the artist
may like to bathe himself in sunshine, as in “Kurra-
beena Point, from Mosman” and “Balmoral,” such
pictures as “Wet Road, Healesville” and “Rain”
show that he can enjoy himself in an overcoat, too.
A very refreshing little show.

Only one Melbourne critic has pointed
out that in his bigger enterprises Paderew-
ski struck wrong notes, though it was obvi-
ous enough. The matter doesn’t seem to be
of great importance. These faults are cer-
tainly not such as are committed by electri-
cally-driven pianolas in good adjustment, hut
they, are liable to occur when a notable
pianist reaches the evening of bis days.
There are probably younger virtuosi capable,
of giving renderings’ of complicated master-
pieces more note-perfectly than Paderewski,
but none who can bring more passion (not
to say fury) and delicate intelligence to
the operation. Even on the physical side
the. musical Pole's achievement at the Audi-
torium bordered on the miraculous. Watch-
ing the ethereal figure drawing without appa-
rent effort every tone and mood out of flic
big piano, while one foot kept up an accom-
paniment of distant thunder, was mysteri-
ously exciting, like watching the ghost of an
ancient warrior routing a regiment of living
soldiers. Into the bargain Paderewski
labored under a burst thumb, and in between
his metropolitan recitals lie packed a shirt
and his colossal memory and trotted off to
Bendigo and Ballarat to entertain the pro-
vincials.

continues to weather fairly successfully a
dull first act, and “Rose Marie” wall say
many happy returns to itself on its first Aus-
tralian birthday at His Majesty’s on Mon-

at the Palace, where “Possum Paddock” will
remain another week.
Elton Black, a Scotch comedian, Lawrence
Johnson, a ventriloquist, Harry North, who
plays on and with a concertina, and the
pattering Carthy Brothers pave the way for
George Ward’s new revue at Melbourne
Bijou, and pave it fairly evenly on the whole.
At Hoyt’s Melbourne house this week
Lefty Flynn as “The Traffic Cop” is showing
our policemen how to do it by transferring
himself from a speeding motor-car to a
rushing charabanc instead of taking the
offender’s number and ringing up the next
station. In addition Lewis Stone is embroi-
dering the witching hour with rich passion
in “The Midnight Lovers”: while the
Majestic, which always furnishes a very
varied and interesting news-gazette, is also
featuring Bert Lytell in “Obey the Law,” a
moral story, and Norma Shearer, who, in
“Upstage,” a theatrical tale, is allowing
knives to be thrown at her in the cause of
melodrama.

Alexander Watson, who has just tinkshed
reciting himself hoarse to large crowds at
Melbourne Playhouse, offers a hint in his
programmes to visiting virtuosi of other
sorts, such as pianists and fiddlers. He does
not pipe exclusively the foreign lay. Souter,
Adams and Roderic Quinn have been given
their turns. But no musician from abroad
has ever heard, apparently, of Henry Tate, or
even Percy Grainger. They surely stand high
enough to figure modestly in a final encore.
Mussolini’s advice to mankind to live dan-
gerously is being followed by that section of
it which frequents the stalls at Melbourne.
Tivoli. An entertainer named Evans lies on
his back on a staging projecting into the
theatre and supports on his soles a pole that
reaches well above the proscenium arch. On
this wavering perch his friend Perez upends
himself by one hand in what appears to be
an excessively uncertain manner. This turn
requires great nerve and courage on the part
of orchestral conductors. In addition, the
remarkable Gallenos continue to toss each
other to and fro with the casualness of bush-
men turning damper. The D’Arcy trio, who
sing and play, are not an unmixed blessing,
but Jarrow coaxes fivers from a lemon more
easily than he draws them from the audience.
Belmont’s canary opera, a score of birds in
cages that sing in good time to the piano,
continue in good voice and feather —the two
go together, and for three months in every
year their owner has to take a holiday while
in's- stock-in-trade recover both. Raymond
Vaughan, an American who has made the
discovery that the xylophone sounds better
when operated by a player lying on his
spine, is rapturously received, and Alexander
Carr, the character-actor, hears only faint
applause, although his work is by far the
most artistic of the evening. He should try
the effect of doing it standing on one leg.
When the Postal Institute choir essayed
the Bach Mass in B Minor at the Audi-
torium it gave a taste of what might have
been achieved had George English, the con-
ductor, been able to mobilise an adequate
force of contralto and male voices. As it
was, though the sopranos overbalanced the
ensemble, the singers showed such intelligent
interest that the difficult fugal passages were
negotiated with scarcely any wavering from
pitch. The soloists, Nellie Gibbs, Victoria
Anderson, Norman Bradshaw and Victor
Harding, were not worthy of the choristers
—Bach, makes tremendous demands. Miss
Anderson, a contralto, withstood the ordeai
better than her associates. The Melbourne
Symphony Orchestra supplied an accompani-
ment, and an organ and piano helped.

Melbourne Art:—
Agnes Goodsir, the Bendigo artist who won a
scholarship and went to Europe, is back again, and
at the Fine Art Gallery in Melbourne. She ha>
been inordinately busy abroad on a model with un-
usually long legs. She has painted Miss Longleg>
with a cigarette, in a blue hat, in a striped skin,
in a chemise, on a conch and in bed drinking morning
tea. She has painted her as a flat but by no meam
ineffective decoration (.No. 8), as a poster (No. 7)
and as a living, breathing creature more in the
round in No. 47. There is some extraordinarily
slovenly work in this show, as well as some that is
extraordinarily good. The infant in No. 46 should
never have been passed by the immigration officers,
and the still-lifes are mere inventories of objects of
competing interest. But the lady has a lively color
sense and a feeling for design. When she invests in
a new model or two and supplies them with more
atmosphere to breathe, she will doubtless surpass
even this extremely bright and antiseptic show.
Miss A. E. Oakley and Mrs. M. Walsoe are show-
ing water-colors at the Institute of Arts. The first-
named, whose admirable wild fiowei's have appeared
in book form, paints the aboriginal flora with under-
standing and a wholesome charm. The second can
best lie described as painting Nature with “sin-
cerity,” the same sincerity with which the present
commentator sets out to build a wash-house and
with a somewhat similar result.
Tlie little shrieks of alarm evoked by “The
Ghost Train" at Adelaide Theatre Royal will
have ceased almost before these lines are
read. “The Green Hat” opens on Saturday.
May 28. At the Prince of Wales the
Yankee melodrama “Under Cover” introduces
Hilda Dorrington as a society girl compelled
to become a secret-service spy. Incidentally,
there is a bedroom scene that keeps all the
puritanically inclined ladies in the audience
on tenterhooks. New star turns at the
Majestic include a clever girl contortionist,
disguised as a green frog. Lily Burnard hits

Old Rill is reviving war memories in “The

“S. Ure”: Pola Negri, the cinema person,
has been married —her third venture on the
matrimonial sea—to a Russian prince. The
cablegram reported that “the evening closed
with fireworks.” It would !
“Hamfat”: Phillip Lytton’s “The Sheik,”
due at the St. James, Sydney, on June 4,
is not the first dramatisation of Mrs. Hull’s
book to be shown in Australia. A well-
known mummer made his own stage version
of the play and took it into the country. He
was handicapped by lack of capital, but a
neat advertising notion helped: his show-
cards for shop windows and bar counters
were in the form of three-cornered tents
with luscious details advertised on every
side. But a patch of bad weather drowned
the show. Neither the public nor sheiks like
wet feet.
“Eye Brow”: Duncan Macdougall is to
do Sean O’Casey’s “Juno and the Paycock”
at his tiny Playbox house next Wednesday
—the first work from this Irish playwright’s
pen to be produced in Sydney. Born in a
Dublin slum, O’Casey sold newspapers as a
boy and became a laborer. He wrote eight
plays before one was accepted by the Abbey
Theatre, where he acquired his technique
watching the performances. For “Juno and
the Paycock” he was awarded the Haw-
thornden Prize for the best work in imagina-
tive literature' by a writer under 40.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Most theatrical houses,
glad enough to welcome ’Varsity students on
other occasions, shoo them off when Com-
mem. is on ; but the Sydney Empire
Theatre people, suffering from inexperience
and a desire to please, appointed a special
’Varsity night. The students are milder
than when they used to pelt the performers
with orange- and banana-skins; but Rufe
Naylor had to implore the buoyant youths
to keep quiet, as angry patrons were
demanding the return of their money. But
the Empire was not the only house which
experienced disturbed conditions that night.
The disturber at another theatre was a din-
ner-suited ancient who made endearing
remarks to the female performers. The
usher who reduced him to silence gazed
at his venerable whiskers with scorn. “If
I’d known you were from the Uni.,” he said
sarcastically, “I wouldn’t have let you in.”
“Yarra Ben”: Why weren’t Melbourne
playgoers allowed to see “Cobra,” in which
Judith Anderson appeared in Sydney, and
which was her starring medium in America?
She had little chance of showing any out-
standing ability in the two pieces, “Tea for
Three” and “The Green Hat,” which Vic-
torians sampled. “The Green Hat” was
about the stupidest concoction staged of late
years. “Cobra” surely couldn’t have been
worse; and at least it provides Judith with
a part that suits her.
“Caul Boy”: The actor who pretends to
be a musician takes chances. Laurie Greig
once sat down at the stage-piano at Mel-
bourne Princess in “The Man from Mexico”
to play “Home, Sweet Home,” as a reply
to a question put to him by Hugh Ward
as to where he was to go. Dead silence
accompanied his flourish on the keyboard,
and looking sideways he observed that Reg
Wykeham, stage manager, was not yet in
his place at the off-stage instrument which
was to provide the noise. To save the
situation Greig swung round with his back
to his piano and engaged Ward in some
make-shift patter. Whereupon the house
was delighted to hear the thing, apparently
without assistance, break out with the
familiar melody. That night Oscar Asche
and Lily Brayton were in the audience, and
Ward had made a special effort to impress
them with his infallibility as a producer.
“J.F.P.” : A Brisbane vaudeville show pre-
sented a Yankee howl about “the. orange-
groves of California.” The producer staged
a scene where chorus-girls picked oranges
off gum-trees.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: He is a good-natured
chap for a comedian, and he tolerantly bore
the criticism of a candid friend who pro-
nounced his act “slush.” “Personally, I think
it very humorous,” was his mild reply. The
critic came back with a new tirade of sar-
casm. “Well, don’t you think it very funny
the way the audience laughs at me?” the
comedian suggested.
“M.G.S.”: Having conscientiously per-
spired through the book before seeing the
play, I found “The Green Hat” extremely
interesting as a revelation of the ways of
producers. In the book the wayward Iris
catches septicaemia in an insanitary Paris
nursing home, run by an unpleasant, collec-
tion of Sairey Gamps; which seems con
WON’T TAKE A SINGLE CHANCE.
“They say she’s so suspicious that she won’t trust anybody or
anything !”
“Distrustful? She’s the limit. She even wears two pairs of sms-.
penders.”
sistent. In the play she acquires the same
complaint in a spotless convent, occupied
by nuns all as lovely as Madonnas; which
seems a strain on the imagination. Pro-
bably Arlen or his advisers thought the play
sordid enough already, and meant to brighten
things up. The result, however, is exactly
the reverse. The Arlen literary style is a
remarkable compost of Wilde, Conrad, Kip-
ling, Sam Pepys, Synge, Dickens, Carlyle,
the Bible (authorised version), a society
letter-writer and a movie subtitlist: and the
dialogue of the play was composed by select-
ing the smartest sayings in the book and
distributing them about the cast. It is as
if a dozen Michael Arlens in various dis-
guises were speaking in rotation.
“Spokeshave”; Students of Maskelyne and
Devant devices are getting their money’s
worth at Melbourne Princess. In “Cornered”
Muriel Starr actually plays three parts. She
is Margaret, a lady, and anon Margaret’s
twin-sister Mary, a crook; then Mary im-
personates Margaret. A girl whose name
does not appear on the programme (she is
an actress of some reputation, nevertheless)
dummies for Mary when she is Margaret,
and for Margaret when she is Mary. Muriel
Starr succeeds in keeping her characters
clearly separated, though that voice of hers
would be recognised in a broadcast of a
Philharmonic concert.
“Eureka”: Beer-bottles have other uses
than for smashing policemen’s jaws. In
Paddington, Sydney, recently I noticed a
number of boys and girls coming in all direc-
tions, each carrying one or more bottles.
They stopped at the back entrance to one of
the houses. Inside the gate I saw a lad
of 12 or so arranging a home-cinema machine.
He made me a guest of honor. The charge
for admission was two beer-bottles or one
lemonade-bottle; the seats were blocks of
wood and stones, and mother’s tablecloth was
used for a screen. Financially and other-
wise it was a great success, the takings being
38 beer-bottles and 11 lemonade-bottles,
which the bottle-o converted into cash next
morning.
“C. Ockney” : Frank Harvey (B. 19/5/’27)
is making good progress in England, though
the big chance hasn’t yet come his way.
He joined Pauline Frederick at the London
Lyceum season of “Madame X.” He did
not play Baroque, his part in Australian
productions of the piece, but Noel, the middle- 1
aged lover of Jacqueline. Another old Aus-
tralian friend, Cecil Brooking, also figured
in the east.
“C u r t a i n
Raiser”: Estrange-
ment after a long
connection is be-
ll i n d J.C.W.’s
action against D.
B. O’Connor to re-
strain him from
using the Firm’s
name in connec-
tion with such
ancient stage fod-
der as "Are You a
Mason?” an d
“What Happened
to Jones.” For
many years the big
show passed on
pieces to O’Connor,
who reared small
companies and
launched them on
the provinces “by
arrangement.” The
producer’s Hell is
paved with writs
as well as good in-
tentions.
“S mad a” : In
the artistic U.F.A.
film at Sydney
Adyar Hall the
only dull patch is
the elaborate scene
of a Roman matron
taking her bath. A
group of semi- or
three-quarter nude
girls make the
ceremonial prepa-
rations ; and the
matron arrives in a
Roman barge at a
marble mausoleum
for her dignified
dip. She who gets
slapped and stri-
giled is rightly
shown as a lady of
40. A Hollywooden
producer would
have picked out a
girl of 17. So ela-
borate was the pro-
cedure that the
Roman lady could
have taken a bath
only at rare inter-
nals. The legend of
the Roman bath
must have been
like that of the Englishman’s tub—more
boasted about than used.
‘‘Caul Boy”: The other day the ground-
man of a troupe of gymnasts at a Melbourne
vaudeville show missed his catch, and the
human ball he was toying with struck the
floor. Luckily, the injury was slight. It
is practically impossible for a groundman
to get another job if lie makes a big mis-
take. The news travels right round the
world and no “top-mounter” will trust him
in future. So when you hear that he pre-
empts £2OO out of the £250 paid to his
troupe, don’t envy him. He gambles with
Death for his job twice a day, and the audi-
ence expects him to do it with a showman’s
grin.
“F.S.”: Nine Australian dramatic critics
out of ten regard their function as indis-
tinguishable from that of the turf tipster.
That is to say, it is their job to pick win-
ners. If one says that “They Knew What
They Wanted” is, dramatically, the best
play presented in recent years, and that play
fades away within a fortnight, then he is "a
bad critic. If one says that "Abie’s Irish
Rose” is a brilliant psychological study of
Jewish and Irish character and the play
runs for a twelvemonth, then he is a good
critic. This is also the opinion of all stage-
managers, producers, entrepreneurs and
theatre shareholders. Looking back over his
own record in this light, the present writer
thinks it is nearly time he retired gracefully
into the fish-and-chips business.
"M.G.S.” : The prevalence of the drug habit
in Melbourne playhouses at the moment
amounts to an obsession. Stanley Henry reduces
himself nightly to a state bordering on the
ridiculous in “Cornered” at the Princess by
absorbing large quantities of cocaine.
Maurice Moscovitch, in “The Ringer” at the
Royal, favors morphia injected hypodermi-
cally. Barrie Livesey, in "The Green Hat”
at the King’s, mixes various opiates with
Scotch. All these victims agree, however,
in acting when under the influence as if
they were sitting in an invisible Ford truck
going over the Ballarat-Geelong road. The
present writer hasn’t the slightest intention
of contradicting them, though none of the
drug-fiends of his acquaintance behave quite
in the same way in ordinary life. In fact,
when he was one himself in a mild way of
business he was constantly upset by his
friends congratulating him on how well he
looked, and the only symptom an advanced
case he knew exhibited was a reluctance, for
obvious reasons, to go in for a swim.
“C.C.”: The indomitable Beresford Fowler
will soon be at it again in Melbourne. He
is rehearsing a whole fistful of Shaw’s plays,
and also “The Fires of St. John,” by Suder-
njann. The star of his last season, Molly
Locke, will assist him in the enterprise.
Molly stands comparison with many of the
curled darlings of the commercial stage, at
any rate on the histrionic side. Fowler is
not a Heaven-sent actor, but he is quite
frequently what the professional men are not
—a genuine producer. Many of them are
merely reproducers.
“Curtain Raiser”: The Firm, apparently
nettled by the suggestion of “Musi Cus”
(B. 12/5/’27) that Moscovitch has a “ghost”
to play liis bit of music in “The Ringer,”
replied in its weekly budget of stage propa
ganda in Melbourne to the effect that the
Russian actor was an accomplished musician
and a Chopin-lover. But why shouldn’t an
actor pretend to be a musician in the world
of make-believe?
“Mlif” : Talk about the torrent of American
films that deluges Australia! The legiti-
mate stage suffers the same infliction.
Last week in Sydney practically every
theatre put on American stuff. Carter “the
Great” is an American. “Tip Toes,” “Cradle
Snatchers,” “Frasquita,” “Is Zat So?”
“Sunny.” Herb Williams, “America’s Great
Buffoon,” and “Getting Gertie’s Garter” an
all imported from- the place where our plays
come from. And at the Stadium two Ameri-
can coons kept the striped flag flying. Thank
Heaven Sydney still has Stiffy and Mo!
“Goldilocks”: Although Eva Novak has
returned to Australia —she went back to
America after helping to make “The Term
of His Natural Life” film—her business this
time is not with Australasian Films, whose
second picture is “Conn, of the Coral Seas,”
but with the new Phillips Films enterprise.
Steele Rudd has provided the story, and
the mostly Australian co., having taken a
number of Sydney scenes, is now on its
way to N.Q* The assistant director, Eric
Wilkinson, is an Australian who put in an
apprenticeship in film-making experience in
America. Nellie Ferguson—NellieOgdenin the
long ago—is amongst the players.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: “Carados” of the Lon-
don Refekee gives a surprising list of well-
known names on the stage whose owners
were not suspected of being Jewish. Ada
Reeve, for instance, was originally Isaacs;
the family name of Sir Arthur Sullivan was
Solomon ; Julia Neilson and Lewis Waller
were of Jewish descent, and the maternal
grandfather of the great Mrs. Kendal was a
Rabbi. “Carados” tells of a rumpus between
Zangwill, whose “The War God” was being
produced, and Tree, who was producing it.
Tree, who also had a dash of Yiddish blood
in his veins, said that greater plays than
Zangwill’s had been staged in his theatre,
some by Shakspeare; “and, thank God. the
author’s dead and can’t come here and show
off his temper.” Retorted Zangwill: “If
Shakspeare is dead that doesn’t prevent him
from being murdered by you every evening
you play him —and twice on Saturdays!”
“Peter Pan”: Maoriland dramatist Cap-
tain Reginald Berkeley, whose war-time
comedy “French Leave” w r as done here by
Emelie Polini and later by Muriel Starr,
now has a London production at the Every-
man Theatre —“The White Chateau." also
with a French atmosphere. A broadcast
version had proved so successful that
Berkeley elaborated it into a full-night’s
bill.
THE CRITIC.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With something of contemptuous frown
He eyes the players up and down.
So young, so blase, and so wise,
His function is to criticise.
He is, in fact, Sir Oracle—
And looks the character as well.
On every play his word is law.
He knows the faults of Bernard Shaw ;
With Ibsen at his finger-ends,
Rarely Pinero he commends.
He knows what Shakspeare meant to say
Better than Asche or Wilkie A.
The well-boomed star askance he’ll view
And pityingly the ingenue.
Who writes such stuff he cannot think.
And when lie’s had another drink
He hurries off—lie’s seen enough.
Besides, they’re waiting for his stuff.
But, thank the Lord, he never says
The things he thinks about the plays.
At least, the things you’d think he thought
From his demeanor tense arfd taut.
With sheer repulsion he may throb,
But still —he wants to keep his job.

Here’s the Best Remedy
for Piles —
REXONA-The
Rapid Healer.
All who suffer from Piles are especi-
ally unfortunate in that they cannot
talk about their complaint. They
must suffer in silence.
To all such Rexona comes as a great
blessing, for it is easily obtained,
easily applied, and the result is
always gratifying.
The distressing symptoms quickly
subside, and mind and body both feel
relief from the constant strain almost
after the first application. In this
Ointment are combined juices and
essences in an entirely new and
unique manner, forming a remedy
justly celebrated'as a Rapid Healer.
Rexona is a remedy which is especi-
ally valuable in the treatment of
Piles. Those who try it will not be
disappointed.
“After suffering from piles since a
child and using many remedies which
gave me no relief, I tried Rexona Oint-
ment with the best results. Rexona bene-
fited me from the first time I used it.”
Mrs. G. WALTERS,
101 t Percival Road,
Stanmore, N.S.IV.

The Restless Years.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TT TE sigh for a faded dawn of old, the
1/1/ sun on the mulga dew
r “ That warmed the heart while the
voice extolled the wealth of a
dream come true,
When Bayley and Ford discovered gold in
the prime of ’ ninety-two.
Ah, days of profit and pride and power! Ah,
yield of the swift years fled
Since rang the knell on the mu'ga’s spell by
a digger’s pick-point sped !
White stars keep, watch on the ghostly
dumps while the old mills starkly gleam
Where the tragic ore from the stope’s rich
store once fell in a roaring stream.
Those night-long ramps of the rowdy camps
and the Fly Flat dust high blown
Have passed with the mates who fared with
me on the famine track and shared with
me;
Who spent and suffered and spared with me
in the brave'hours nightward flown.
But let us arise and pace the pad which
called to the stout hearts then,
In the liot-foot time of our speed and prime
in the wake of battling men
Whose trodden dust like a crimson pall
crept up in the startled dawn
To lower and lift like a flame adrift till the
coals of day were drawn.
To Bayley’s reef was the clarion call by
never a soul denied—
We held straight on in the dogged ruck while
the garish sun rays fiercely struck,
Each courting the furtive glance of luck with
a ceaseless steadfast stride.
We pegged in the dusk on TindaPs flat. We
toiled for a quick return,
Blowing it dry for the values high, making
the surplus burn
At night when the lamps of festival, shone
down on the bearded throng
Which staked good gold for its hundredfold
in a gale of strident song.
We worked us each from his shallow claim,
while further afield we vowed
Through the distant liazc on the skyline spun
we’d travel a course by star and sun
And peg where the reefs of fortune run,
concealed in the scrub’s dark shroud.
C’oolgardie, queen of the restless days! Old
city of hearts a-swell,
When the wash aslieen from the shaker*
screen in a sparkling cascade fell!
Old camp of a past fraternity, of dolly and
pick and dish
That showed the fire of the heart’s desire,
denied or granted the wish,
We sang for you and we sprang for you in
carnival, calm or gale ;
We have spread your fame and boasted you,
known thirst in the droughts which
roasted you,
And many a time we’ve toasted you in the
coldest amber ale!
Come, follow the pads of ’ninety-four and
halt where the new camps thrive!
Co, squander the fame of Hannan’s claim
to the winds of ’ninety-five !
We followed the gold from Charlotte’s crown
to the south of “Brookman’s Run.”
Wheu the Boulder woke to the eager stroke
that bared its wealth to the sun
In canvas cities we made carouse ere a single
stamp was hung
To lift and fall through the years of gain,
of pleasure and turmoil, joy and pain,
That witnessed the profits wax and wane till
the requiem was rung.
Old miner mates of the top-note years when
the century was new,
Behold the lights of the toilsome nights which
flared for the help of you!
Cive heed once more to the whistles shrill
that rang you a gruelling shift
While the loaded skips engaged the tips and
the white dust rolled adrift!
For, though we have journeyed each his way,
the storm of an olden strife,
The smite of shoes on the sulphide ore, the
clatter of steel and the ball-mill’s roar
Above the stopes of a treasure store gave
speed to the pulse of life.
We knew the whir of the driving wheels
when a thousand cams made play,
Timing the tread of a thousand head through
the shifts of night and day;
The stays and trusses, the straining guys
by the sailor splicers rigged,
The streaming plates and the concentrates
where the Wilfley tables jigged;
Red furnace fires and the roaster pyres and
the smoke stacks file on file—
The low, white pall of the ore dust blown
from Boulder South to the Hannan’s
zone
When fortune shone in the yielding stone
we won on the Golden Mile.
We’ve seen the glitter of Brownhill ore and
Oroya’s telluride.
The lights aglow on the Ivanlioe, the peak of
? the Lake View’s pride.
We’ve toiled in the Golden Horseshoe drives
to measures of chanting drill,
While the Boulder Block received the shock
of the Perseverance mill.
Deep down in the Boulder’s throbbing vaults
we’ve labored in winze and stope—
From North Ivalgurli to Hannan’s Star we’ve
followed the gleam of candles far
With truck and spawler and drill and bar
through the lilting years of hope.
Scattered are we like wheat husk blown bv
the wayward winds of fate,
For the yields arc small where the stamp-
heads fall and the tempest tones abate.
We burn the timber and turn the soil to the
purging light of day,
And dream by night of the salt-lakes white
and the saltbush ashen grey
Where some yet follow the tragic gleam
through the years of sad unrest,
While fortune sleeps in the haze aglow,
under the. drift of the ridges low.
By sombre hills where film bull-oaks grow
in the golden-hearted West.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
KATRINE was born a Mahoney. That
meant that in appearance she was tall
and big-boned, with hollow cheeks and
blue, pale-lashed eyes. To be born a Mahoney
also meant to have a close acquaintanceship
with cows. The first dawn of consciousness
with Kate, as with every one of her family,
was intimately bound up with the sound of
cows lowing in the soft, dewy mornings, the
staccato squirt of milk into buckets and the
thud of rails being jerked on to the ground.
Always as a child she had watched the
Mahoney men—big, raw-boned creatures
with reddish hair—trailing off to the cow-
sheds in the early morning, and in the late
afternoon, as regularly as the sun rose and
set. Whatever else happened, the cows must
not be neglected. What were they, these
strange, gentle beasts, with their wet-looking,
bored eyes and moving mouths, that de-
manded such unswerving allegiance, that
clamored so unceasingly for attention? As
she became older the fact of pounds, shil-
lings and pence dawned on her; and she
ceased to wonder.
After leaving school she had to do her
share, and came to regard the animals as a
necessary evil. She ceased to torture herself
with the meaning of what lay behind them
and all the drudgery of the farm. Her
imagination as yet was a vague, nebulous
thing, as vague as the little impalpable lakes
that lay dreaming against the sky-line. She
was a plain child at 14, skinny-shouldered,
with perpetually red hands and freckles on
her fair skin.
Without question, she played her part in
the ritual of the farm. Most of it had to do
with the milk and the large, dinted, sil-
very cans that were carted away to the
factory. Sometimes she rode on the waggon
with her brother Bill, and though there was
a sameness about these journeys she enjoyed
them. They would pass carts with squeal-
ing, naked-looking pigs poking their moist
noses through the nets, and blue, rattling
drays with wheels of dusty scarlet. There
would sometimes be the smell of rotting cab-
bages as they passed farms lying close to
the road, and yellow hay stooked up with
mathematical precision. Away in the dis-
tance would lie the fiat country, unreal and
beautiful, with the colors of an opal del-
phinium about it, with the windmills turning
airily everywhere, with the thin trees on the
horizon and the lines of pollard-willows, the
color of pewter, looking like things that grew
under the sea. Beautiful, this, so that it
stirred her to wonder and touched her pale
eyes with a brooding mystery.
In the township there was more to see,
though it did not affect you in quite the
same breathless way. The wide streets lay
under arched elms that gave you a feeling
of security in the midst of bustle. But you
always went back to the farm, where one
day was any day, with the changeless routine
of baking, cleaning, cutting lunches and
mending woollen socks that became hard in
the wash, as though frost had caked them.
She Avas simply a slave to the farm —but
again, the farm was slave to the cows.
Katrine came infinitely further down.
She was 20 when she became aware of
Abe Wilson. He was a tall man, with dark
good looks and a habit of silence. His
brother had a farm over the Bald Hills, but
he himself did odd jobs and saved money,
lie would come over about milking-time and
watch her with a brooding, ruminating look.
“Money in cows!” he said one day, chew-
ing a straw. “Damned if I”
He didn’t finish it; and she looked up at
him, the fair hair curling about her forehead
in the heat, feeling strangely drawn to him
because lie was so unlike the Mahoney men.
She began to think of him of a night when
they all sat round the dying kitchen fire,
too tired for coherent speech. She would
look across at her father, snoring with his
feet up on the bricks, at her brothers bicker-
ing over a dirty pack of cards, and ask
herself in fear, “Will it always be like
this? Is this all?” And the question would
follow. “All of what?” And she didn’t
know. But she knew that she wanted some-
thing ; and she took the thought of black
Abe Wilson with her when she went off with
the white-faced alarm-clock under her arm,
and thought her thoughts—terrible, lawless
thoughts, winged with an unknowable magic.
One night Bill looked-up from hacking at
his nails with a knife.
“That Abe Wilson ! He’s after you, Kate.
You’re his girl now.”
“I don’t know,” she said with her soft
hesitating speech, but a feeling of happiness
surged over her.
“He’s all right,” said Bill, going back to
his nails. “He’s going to buy his brother’s
farm. He’s dotty on cows.”
“Yes,” she said dully. Something sagged
in her. For a moment she had had a wild
thought of escape, a vision of something
away from and beyond this old life. But
there was no escape. Yet she would love
him. That was it. She wanted love—that
terrible hunger that would not let you be.
They were married a year later. It was
mid-spring. A glamorous time, when the
yellow flowers were blowing in the sheeny
grass along the wide country roads, and the
milk had a strange warm taste because of
the prevalence of the weed.
Abe’s farm, bought from his brother, was
a dark place surrounded by immense, scraggy
pines. Inside the house you seemed to smell
darkness along with the piercing scent of the
sodden needles; and it was as though the
trees rocked the place in their great arms
and crooned to it. The sound was inter-
mingled with the crying of the cows down
in the yard.
It seemed to Katrine that the same cows
had come over from the Mahoney’s. She
knew them all. She could never get away
from the warm, rich smell of them, the
sound of their plaintive bellowing, and their
steady chewing when she went out in the
windy dark to draw water at the well.
Abe was grossly proud of them. He would
stand at the door, his old felt hat tipped
over one eye, while he looked out and saw
them winding over the bare hill.

Kidney disease often advances so rapidly that many
a person is firmly in its grasp before aware of its
progress. Prompt attention should be given to the
slightest symptom of kidney disorder. If there is a dull pain in the back, headache, dizzy spells, or a
tired, worn-out feeling, or if the kidney secretions are irregular and attended by pain, procure a good
kidney remedy at once. Sydney people recommend Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. Read these
statements: —
TWO COMPLETE CURES.
Mrs. Pullbrook, Senr., No. 342 King Street, St. Peters,
Sydney, says: “For six or seven years 1 was troubled with
weak and disordered kidneys. The chief symptom was back-
ache, and the pain I suffered was awful. When I stooped the
agony in standing up again was almost unbearable, and I often
bad to get someone to help me. Nothing I took seemed to
relieve the pain, and I used to wonder if I would ever be well
again. One day I was urged by a friend to try Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills, and it was a real friend’s advice, for a few
bottles completely cured me. My experience proves that Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills are a genuine remedy, and I sincerely
trust that other sufferers will benefit by my experience and take
these splendid pills.”
Twelve years later Mrs. Pullbrook says: “I am still a
great believer in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and would not
like to be without them. They are invaluable to the kidney
sufferer.”
TESTIMONY
FROM
SYDNEY.
Mr. Thomas Duggan, No. 99 Connell’s Point Road, Hurst-
ville, Sydney, says: “I am pleased to tell you that Dosin’s
Backache Kidney Pills have done me the world of good, kor
a long time I was so ill with backache and kidney trouble
that I was almost a cripple, not being able to move without
enduring positive torture. My limbs swelled very much, show-
ing serious signs of dropsy, and this worried me a good deal.
I tried all kinds of remedies, but they did not benefit me, and
I was fast losing hope of a cure. One day I happened to hear
that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were a splendid remedy
for all kidney ailments, so I got some at once. After taking
them for about a week I began to feel better, and as I per-
severed a steady improvement was noticeable, twelve bottles of
these grand pilis fixing me up completely.”
Pour years later Mr. Duggan says: “I have had no return
of backache and kidney trouble since Doan’s Pills cured me
over four years ago.”

Kate never milked now, because they had
a boy to help, but she was never free from
work. Her face, with its always hollow
cheeks, grew more sunken, and she lost her
color. Abe did not notice. She was only a
fraction of the farm. Sometimes of a night,
sitting under the lamplight, he would watch
her holding the sewing close to her nose, and
feel vaguely irritated because her sight was
bad.
The child was born when they had been
married nearly five years. Something in
Abe seemed to grow softer and more alive
as he watched the boy grow. Kate, hungry
to please him, was glad again.
“A bouncing kid,” she said one evening.
“The Mahoney nose and hand”
“Yairs. A good hand to hold the teats,”
he said with a burst of laughter. “He’ll be
a good milker. Guess I’ll be putting in more
lucerne now.”
A vague fear laid hold of Kate. She put
a protective arm round the baby sleeping
in the dress-basket with the broken corners.
“Abe, p’raps he won’t want to farm.
P’raps lie’ll want the town, and”
“P’raps your grandmother!” said black
Abe, frowning.
Kate sat watching the sleeping boy, pas-
sionate resentment in her eyes. Was he
for the farm and the hungry cows, too?
They had taken Abe. She told herself with
a sudden horror what she would not admit
before, that she had given all and got no-
thing. Abe had never given her the love
that she had craved for. Something had
come between them. It was the cows. The
cows had claimed him. Would they take
and hold little Petie, too?
Work on the farm increased with the
years. Kate got thinner, as though work
had worn her down fine. Abe sowed more
lucerne, and boasted of it, because it
flourished without irrigation. The house got
shabbier and shabbier. She never had new
clothes. Her eyes hurt.
“Can’t we have some new floor-covering?”
she asked once, in her soft, hesitating way.
“This did your brother for years. The
O’Days have a carpet, and”
“Shiftless, that’s what I call the O’Days!
Half a dozen cows and their udders’ll be
bursting for the want of milking!” Abe
Avas scornful, his dark unshaven chin thrust
out. “And Missus with new cement troughs
In !”
“They’d be fine to wash at,” said Kate
Avistfully. “All that carrying water to the
tubs fair breaks your back.”
Abe had not heard her. He was worrying
about a sick heifer.
She washed out in the sun and rain, at
the back of the house, in zinc tubs that were
so low that she had to stoop. Sometimes the
child helped her to carry the buckets. He
was a sturdy boy. with the Mahoney height,
but with the Wilson dark good looks.
When he Avas 13 he started to milk of a
morning before he went to school. That
made him tired. In the nights he sat in the
dark kitchen, snivelling over home-work that
would not come right. Abe would tell him
to shut up—that a farmer had no cause to
Avorry over lessons.
“Oh, Abe!” Kate’s mind would rebel pas-
sionately. “Learning out of books teaches
people to get the best out of life.”
The boy would pucker bis face and look
at bis father cunningly, bis tongue exploring
bis teeth at the back.
At 15 lie was doing a man's work. Kate’s
heart yearned over him as she saw him
going out into the yard, bis blue shirt open
at the throat. He was gentle with her, and
a soft word from him would make her face
flush.
When Petie was 19 Abe died from the
effects of a stroke.
Kate looked into the room where his
body lay with a dull horror. Outside the
cows were lowing. She had a fearful feeling
that he could still hear them. She told
herself that she had had nothing. A word
here, a look there —and now he was gone.
She clung to Petie, her frustrated love
fastening on to him with hungry tentacles,
“Never mind, Mother,” he said. “We’ll
carry on. Be milking 40 soon.”
She looked at him and thought how like
his father he was.
As the months passed, her love grew more
insistent: but he left her for long nights,
and in the township sbn would find him
sitting on the saleyard rails, and lie would
leave her to harness up. Lear touched her.
Then Petie got secretive, and took to put-
ting on high collars of a night when he
went over to see the shiftless O’Days. One
afternoon lie brought a strange girl home.
She was a fair young thing, and she lit
up the dark room as a lamp might have
done. Petie said awkwardly that she had
been staying at the O'Days for some weeks.
The three of them stood looking at each
other —-the young man with his rude, hand-
some youth, the slim girl anxious to please,
and the faded woman with her waspish
waist and restless higli-veined hands. There
was a vague hostility in the air.
Kate sat alone in the dusk when they had
gone. She heard their voices in the yard,
suggesting an intimacy from which she was
excluded. She knew what it was. This
girl had taken Petie. She had never had
Petie. She stared out and saw the dark
figures of the cows standing by the trees.
Patient, quiet things they looked —but she
knew better. They had taken Petie, too.
They were like the old fire-breathing crea-
tures that she had read of in mythology.
Dragons! Terrible, insatiable beasts for ever
demanding sacrifice. She knew a sudden
flare of resentment, and a desire to battle.
She confronted Petie next day.
“Petie, my back is near broke. Can’t we
have troughs put in to wash?”
“We lost on those cows,” lie said sullenly.
“Two milkers died last week”——
“And my eyes are bad. These cheap
glasses are no good,” She was getting reck-
less, her spare frame trembling her eyes
hating him as he sat there complacently
behind his paper. “A new cushion for the
buggy is what we need.”
“We want all the money for the farm,”
said Petie fretfully. “You women are
always the same.”
The cows were mooing outside. “Moo-
mooo-mooo !” A long-drawn, muffled cry as
though they were in pain. There was the
clank of a windmill that seemed to be run-
ning to the bitter wind of her thoughts. She
gave a little, hopeless gesture.
“What have you wanted for, mother, any-
how?” he asked roughly.
She liked to hear him say “mother” like
that. She wanted to answer, “Love, that’s
what I've wanted”; but she was ashamed,
and sat rubbing her wrinkled hands together,
saying “Yes,” when he asked if lie might
have the girl Paula over for a few days,
as he had asked her to marry him.
The girl came. Kate found that it was
impossible to go oil hating her. She .was
so much of a joyous child in lief pink Check
dress, hanging on to PetiC’s hairy arm, and
rolling in the green lucerne wliefe tliey
were trussing it in tile paddock. Of a.ii
evening she sat throwing arch glances dt Petie
and saying that if Site livfed tllefe she Wduld
have a red Carpet, ahd this afid that. To
which Petie answered gOod-hUmbl'edly;, and
Kate Smiled a wr.y smile, aS tlibugh she knew
something that Pauld did not know. And
Paula was so gentle with her. One evening
the girl came and put her arms round her
as she stood in the yard feeding the fowls.
“I love cows, don’t you?” she laughed.
“Their eyes are like velvet.”
“Get out!” said Kate with a surge of
hatred, shooing away a bleating calf.
Paula’s hand lay on her shoulder, and it
hurt her —so soft and gentle.. .. She looked
ahead, startled. She saw Paula married to
Petie. Saw her boived down under the
weight of unaccustomed work, shackled to
the farm—shackled to the beasts out there.
Her youth going—gone—old before her time.
Something of horror came to her with the
sighing of the dark pines.
The day after, she had a fall. Not_ a bad
fall; but she was shaken, and stayed in bed.
Petie, with a faraway look in his eyes, Went
off to a cattle-sale, with a careless word of
condolence. Paula stayed. All day Kate
had the consciousness of soft, ministering
fingers about liei—something that exltdcd
love. It hurt her and brought tears iiltb
her throat. , ,
“You are too old,” said tile girl tenderly;
“You shouldn’t do anything.”
“How old?’* demanded Kate hafslily, Won-
dering. .. .
“SixtydavC, said PhuM breathlessly, as
though she had beep kind.
Kate cackled, li,er stringy throat working.
“I’m not fifty,” she Said, and lay back.
Watching ah uncertain fear blanch the girl’s
round fade, and her bright eyes fill with
tears.
“Petie shouldn’t have gone to-day,” said
Paula incoherently. “Men —they are selfish.”
She stroked the thin hand lying on the white
honeycomb quilt. “I would like you to love
me,” she said.
Kate stared up at the boarded ceiling.
Her heart felt as though it was bursting.
She loved this girl because she could not
help it—and because she loved her, this
thing must not happen. She must never
marry Petie. She must save her from that.
Petie was the son of his father. Petie was
Mahoney and Wilson. Petie would break
the heart of this young thing, delicate as
a flower. Petie and the cows between them!
It all came back to the cows!
She sat up in bed, her hands pulling at
her high-necked nightdress. Petie Would
hate her —her little son Petie; it was like
striking Petie in the back with a knife. But
Paula was a woman, just as she was a
woman.....
She pointed out to the yard where the
cows were gathering.
“You tnustu't marry Petie,” she said in
all old* flat voice. “Look at me! Before'
m.y age ybu will be the same; Oh, no; there
is ntj escape. You cannot tell yburself that
it Will he different. He is his father—and
I know. Lb,ok out thebe, Paula. Thebe abe
the cows; They fire the things that Will
matteb. Bhey will always niatteb. You can
bruise .your heart and your soul, al}d it will
be nbtliiyg. It i£ only the bows, that Will
be Something.” She drew back the spotted
curtain with a trembling hand. “Look.
Paula. You think they’re gentle creatures.
They’re not. They’re the old dragons that
you’ve read about. Listen to them lowing.
They’re always asking for sacrifices. It’s
always women they want —always women.
Dragons !”
The girl stared uncomprehendingly, then
she shuddered.
“Oh,” she said, “you—you frighten me.
It’s worried me before, but”
“You must not marry Petie,” said the old
woman ; and she felt that she was running
that knife deep into Petie’s strong heart.
“Tell me!”
They stared at each other, and the girl
dropped her eyes first.
“I won’t marry him,” she said slowly. “1
am not brave enough—now.”
Petie stood at the door, his black eyes
smouldering, his fist clenched. , lie came
into the room, and stood over tlie bed.
“What’s this?” he shouted. “Ttais she been
trying to turn against me, Paula?, These
old Womeii—they’re always mad with jeal-
Ybii’ve . always hated ..her mother —
you’ve alwayk hated Paula. That’s it!”
“Petie!” illlie girl threw out her hands
in terrob;
fcate was trying tb say that, it was be-
cause she loved Paula —just that! _ But she
realised the futility of all she might say,
and was silent.
The mother and son stared at one another.
In the eyes of the son was bitter hatred.
The mother was trying to turn it away, but
she could not. It was going deep down, deep
down, right into her heart like a sword—
even as she wounded Petie with her blow.
“Let me go home to-morrow,” said Paul i
sobbing. “Be kind to me, Petie, but I could
not live on a farm —now.”
They went out together. The woman
old before her time lay back staring at the
ceiling, wrapped up in the bitterness of her
victory.
The cows were mooing plaintively outside.
Someone kicked over a bucket. There was
an uneven beat of hoofs.
“Ach!” moaned Katrine. “Beasts! Cows!
Dragons!”
