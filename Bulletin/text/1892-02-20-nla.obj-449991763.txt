and the cost of doing so. My long experience in the

therefore, to

The Imported Criminal.
Ever since the race of globe-trotters first
commenced to pervade Australia, and to
travel on free pauper passes on the Govern-
ment railways, and to deliver lectures, and
make garbled notes, and then go “home”
and write dreary, muddled books about the
things they hadn’t seen and the facts they
hadn’t heard, an impression has been abroad
that Australia is pre-eminently a land of
crime. With hardly an exception, the family
of globe-trotters has been solid on this point,
right down to the lamented Christie
Murray, which insolvent Munchausen
was, perhaps, the most solid of them all.
The Australian larrikin has been officially
inspected, and his howl and oath have been
analysed and reduced to their component
parts, and held up on the fork of righteous
indignation to be the scorn of a moral world.
The football barracker and the native bruiser
and the “sporting man” have all been dis-
sected, and proved to be prodigiously loud-
mouthed and blatant and obnoxious. The
Australian “drunk” is alleged to be more
numerous than the “drunk” in almost any
other part of the world ; the swindlers and
homicides and brutal-assault men are past
counting, and bigamists, thieves, garrotters,
cattle-stealers, horse-stealers, sheep-stealers,
dog - stealers, forgers, rioters, incendi-
aries, gamblers, loafers, libellers, per-
jurers, embezzlers, counterfeit - coiners,
burglars, bushrangers, and people who aban-
don illegitimate infants on doorsteps all help
to make up a mass of criminality at which
the moral British nation is officially requested
to shudder. And the godly Bull has shud-
dered accordingly. Nearly every literary
visitor who has infested Australia for the last
25 years has gone back to complain of how
we have degenerated from the lofty British
standard, and the mother-land has grieved
in many leading articles accordingly.
# * #
In one respect the literary globe-trotter is
correct. Australia has a very high average
of criminality. There is nothing to be gained
by denying this fact, even if we had any
wish to deny it. The average is far
from being the highest- among civilised
nations, but the exact proportion between
Australian crime and that of Europe and
America is a matter into which we have no
time at present to inquire. The point at
issue is, that what is commonly described as
Australian crime is really imported British
crime ; that the malefactor who arouses a
shudder in the bosom of the moral British
visitor is his own malefactor ; and that the
offensive Englishman who wails in print over
the degradation which prevails in Australia
really supplies the degradation that he wails
over. There is a wondrous hypocrisy about
that Anglo-Saxon pietist who furnishes this
whole continent with drunkkrds and law-
breakers, and then is pre-eminent in
grief over the falling-away of the nation
which he has contaminated with the offal of
his three kingdoms, but it is strictly in
keeping with his entire history. He even
feels hurt that Australia is not sufficiently
grateful for that offal, and is indignant
because the prospect of another large con-
signment, heralded by the dissonant tam-
bourine and the great Salvation drum,
arouses no enthusiasm in the land.
* * *
At the present time, and so far as can be
ascertained from the figures immediately
available, New South Wales is the most con-
spicuously criminal of the Australian pro-
vinces. The population of New South Wales
may be roughly described as consisting of 72
per cent, natives of Australia, about 26 per
cent, imported inhabitants from the British
islands, and the balance—with which we
have, at present, nothing to do—of various
nationalities. The native population is thus
very nearly three times as numerous as that
which has been sent here in a ready-made
condition from Great Britain, aud it is at
least reasonable to suppose that the native-
grown criminal would also be three times as
numerous as the exotic article. He ought,
indeed, to be far more numerous to justify
the lofty moral attitude assumed by the
average British critic, but leaving out the
tttitude of that pompous censor, it seems
fair to assume that the two nations would
prove equally law-abiding and equally law-
less. It is rather surprising, therefore, to
find that, out of over 38,000 criminals, great
and small, arrested in New South Wales
during 1890—the last year for which the
figures are available—only about 15,000 were
Australians, while over 19,000 were natives
of Britain. In other words, the Briton, in
proportion to his numbers, is about four-
times as criminal as the Australian ; and
when this outrageous national malefactor
publishes criticisms upon the law-abiding
person whose land he infests, and the
offender remonstrates—because of his own
offences—with the person who didn’t commit
these offences, the great art of Pecksniffism
reaches its climax.
* * #
In all the many branches of criminality
there is hardly one in which the imported
Briton is not pre-eminent. He supplies
8700 drunkards against 3900 locally-g rown
dipsomaniacs, and is thus, in proportion to
numbers, more than six times as drunk as
the native inebriate. Under the headings,
“murder, attempted murder, and man-
slaughter,” he furnishes 21 offenders against
31 of Australian origin, thereby showing
himself, man for man, twice as murderous
as the rest of the population. In the matter
of assaults, plain and garnished with robbery
and other trimmings, the arrests show 778
of British, against 1149 of Australian birth,
which—again allowing for the relative num-
bers of the two nations—shows that the
Briton is just twice as much addicted to
leaping on an inoffensive stranger with his
hobnailed boots as is the humble aboriginal
rowdy of the south. And, strangely enough,
it is under the designation of “aggravated
assault ” that the Englishman is most con-
spicuous ; he loves to prance on the head of
his prostrate victim and gouge his eye out or
kick his teeth down his throat, and at the
same time he complains sadly in the Fokt-
niohtly Review that the Australian has “ a
strain of cruelty ”in his composition. In
every variety of crime which implies revolt-
ing brutality the imported person keeps far
ahead. Out of seven garrotters arrested,
four were English, which is exactly four
times their fair proportion. Under the
headings of “wounding” and “inflicting
grievous bodily harm ” the cultured Briton
is nearly as prominent. He comes in well
in front, too, in the matter of “cruelty to
animals,” which is a strictly British charac-
teristic, and in the matter of “wife and
child desertion,” which may possibly be
placed under the same category, he is three
times as conspicuous as the native-born
inhabitant.
# # •
The Australian, it is commonly asserted,
is a diseased person with a tendency to
erotic mania, and many frantic newspapers
with a longing for unclean sensationalism
have bewailed this alleged tendency to all
manner of sexual offences. The assertion,
according to the indisputable evidence of
figures is a lie—the same dreary lie as all the
rest. In those dismal crimes that are
described in the records as “rape” and
“ indecent assault ” the British section of the
population is, as usual, in a front seat. They
furnish, in proportion to numbers, about
twice as many offenders as do the native
Australians. They also supply five times as
many lunatics, six times as many cases of
indecency, three times as many of riotous
and disorderly conduct, and five times as
many of vagrancy, as do the rest of the
population. In every sort and description
of stealing—larceny, cattle, horse, and sheep-
stealing ; embezzlement, forgery, false pre-
tences, arson, coining, and all kinds of plain
and fancy felony—the British leprosy is well
to the front, and the British criminal is 50
per cent, more numerous than the one of
local manufacture. He also keeps ahead in
all the small offences which lend a light and
humorous aspect to the solemn poliorecords.
He refuses to pay his cab-fare, and thereby
defrauds a hard-working cabman and robs
an exhausted horse of its oats, four times as
often as anybody else in New South Wales,
He is three times as much given to defama-
tory libel as all the rest of the population,
nine times as much given to “illegally
pawning,” and nine times as much addicted
to being a suicided corpse in a river and thus
damaging the water supply. He has the
heading “conspiracy ” all to himself ; he is
in evidence for “ polluting water he de-
clines to pay his train-fare twenty-four times
as often as the Australian native ; he is iu
an enormous majority iu the matter of
hawking without a licence ; he travels
on the railways without a ticket more
than twice as much as any other citi-
zen, and he is more than twice as
much addicted to dog-stealing, contempt of
court, and absconding from bail. Except in
such matters as “ disturbing a congregation ”
and a Very few more, the Englishman is
everywhere predominant. If that imported
Briton could be driven unanimously into a
deep part of the sea, New fcouth Wales
would become —through his loss - one of the
most law-abiding countries upon this earth.
* * #
The British malefactor infests all the Aus-
tralasian provinces to a greater or less
degree; in the majority he is even mote
obnoxious than he is iu New South Wales.
In Maorilaud, in paiticular, the English
population furnishes from ten to thirteen
times more criminals in proportion to num-
bers than do the native-born inhabitants—
the proportion varies, hut for 14 years the
English criminal has never been less than
1000 per cent, in advance of all others. And
unhappily, in all the Australasian provinces,
this obnoxious variety of Anglo-Saxon keeps
steadily increasing. The beetle-browed
British ruffian - the individual with the
bullet-head and the hair like traol doormats
—the sneak-thief and the brutal-assault man
and the embezzler—are for ever coming,
and as they come the pious globe-trotter
keeps on lamenting about the criminality
of this degenerate nation. The English-
man still recognises upon these shores
the ancient sign, “Rubbish may be shot
here.” He sends the rubbish, and reproaches
Australia with having it when it is sent, and
he also suggests military coercion and blood-
shed when this country objects to him send-
ing any more. He is the original offender
and also the individual who wears an air of
solemn reproach concerning the offences.
He pervades every stratum of Australian
society. He supplies this country with
Governors, archbishops, bishops, politicians,
railway officials, and college professors, and
grabs every good salary that is going ; he
also supplies burglars, sneak theives, gar-
rotters, and hoodlums who, being unprovided
with an official salary, get in by the window
at night and grab the family spoons. And,
in addition to all these things, he furnishes
much solemn warning about the necessity of
maintaining a high standard of morality in
“ the kawlinies,” and last of all he wants to
know why we are not grateful for the bene-
fits accruing from the British connection.
Somehow we are not grateful. The bloated
English rowdy who drinks and howls
throughout the continent does not appeal to
the Australian soul as a spectacle that is
calculated to arouse gratitude.
Woman’s Work in Sydney.
It is frequently and loudly asserted that Aus-
tralia is not as other portions of the earth are.
Here we have no proletariat, no poverty, no
caste system —in short, none of the evils or
grievances under which the Old World labours
and groans. This is a land flowing with milk
and honey, teeming with wealth, stuffed with
riches, and exuding fat and plenty. It is a
land of corn and wine and fruit, which God has
kept pure and unspotted throughout the ages
as a guerdon for the Anglo-Saxon race. This
is a beautiful sermon, preached from a lying
text, with which to tickle the cars of Old
World emigrants and solace those self-deluding
Australians whose breath of life is “ blow,” and
whose existence is one eternal brag. As a
matter of fact, we are doing all we can to
exhaust our advantages, and to reduce onr
country to the same level of commercial and
industrial degradation as that reached by
Europe and America. We have imported a
ready-made system which has only to work
sufficiently long to grind ns all to powder—-at
least excepting the few who may manage to
get a grasp on the handle of the driving-wheel.
» # *
The modern industrial system is marked by
a total disregard of the comfort, the con-
venience, the health, nay, the very life of the
raw material of flesh and* blood upon which it
operates for the purpose of extracting profit.
The extreme callousness of the old world
employer may not yet characterise the profit-
monger of Australia, nevertheless the system
has been introduced, it is thriving iu a fat soil,
and wants little encouragement to culminate in
a state of things such as that revealed by the
match-girls’ strike in London. If anyone
wants reliable evidence of the condition of
female-labour in so young a city as Sydney, for
instance, we would refer them to the report on
woman’s work recently prepared by Mr. T. A.
Coghlan, the N.S.W. Government Statistician,
in which all the information obtainable through
the operation of the Census and Industrial
Returns Act of 1891, is classified and tabulated
in a thorough and scientific fashion, forming
a body of well-arranged statistics, some of
which are appalling, when one comes to read
between the lines. In his report, Mr. Coghlan
furnishes the public with data respecting the
tailoring, dressmaking, millinery and white-
work industries, the woollen-cloth manufacture,
and the laundry business.
* * *
The information supplied in this report com-
prises facts concerning accommodation, division
of labour, classification of work, rates of ))a
raent, earnings, hours of labour, fines, earnin'
of home-workers and outside workers ; SVVe J s
ing, employment of children, morality, wa»esai 1
piecework, apprenticeship, overtime, liealth
etc., and gives a very detailed statement j’
reference to the whole field represented by 0"
sewdng and washing trades, and the
cloth manufacture. In regard to accomnioda
tion, one of the most striking features of th"
report is the poor character of the sanitary
arrangements provided for employes. The/
arrangements are seldonl good, very o fter*
inferior, and too frequently had. At one place'
where live men and twenty women are working
there is hut one small closet for general use'
At another place, the sanitary conveniences are
in connection with a large arcade, where the
cabinets for both sexes adjoin, and are separated
only by a corrugated iron fence, six feet i u
height and open at the top. In some cases no
sanitary arrangements exist at all, and this
remark applies to one of the most pretentious
establishments in Sydney —although the fact is
not mentioned in the report. In one of the
suburbs, the nearest conveniences of a sanitary
character to a large tailoring factory are iu
connection with the railway station ! Both
in the large factories and in workshops, where
tailoring is carried on, no attempt is made to
afford facilities for the prevention, extinction or
escape from lire. The approaches to many
workshops are dark and dingy ; the stairways
are rickety, steep and narrow, and lighted by
gas during the daytime. In case of fire they
are practically useless. In the busy season 80
girls and men work in one long room, the
approach to which is a ladder through a trap-
hole. The entire length of the room on the
next floor has to be traversed before a corres-
ponding trap-hole and ladder can be reached.
The tailoress makes more money than any
other employe in the sewing trades, but then
her calling is not so respectable. The home-
worker, however, has rather a bad time of it.
One woman with a family of four to support
was compelled to work twelve and fourteen
hours a day in addition to the time devoted to
her household affairs, and this for an average
remuneration of fourpence half-penny per hour.
The earnings of by far the greater number of
home-working tailoresses range from ten to
fifteen shillings a week. Mr. Coghlan re-
marks :
The tendency to a minimum wage already resulting
from the existence of this large body of incompetent
workers, is still further aggravated by the competition of
women not wholly dependent upon their own earnings.
For example, there are numerous cases where married
women whose husbands earn fair wages seek to increase
their incomes by tailoring work, and it is by this class
that the minimum price for piecework is most frequently
accepted.
We have beard of one instance of a trousers-
hand who was compelled to work hours a
day—los hours a week—to make four pairs of
trousers for which she received from one shil-
ling to two shillings per pair. She had to
furnish her own thread and lining, and her
average earnings were five and sixpence a day
when in full work. Sometimes, however, she
had no more than three pairs per week to make
and her average weekly earnings were twenty
shillings, out of which she had to pay about
sixteen for rent and living. Her clothing was
untidy and slipshod, her person dirty, her room
in a state of woeful disorder—but then she was
at the time working 17i hours per diem, and
had little leisure for what she doubtless con-
sidered superfluous adornment.
* * *
The dressmaker is a grade higher iu the
social scale than the tailoress ; but she makes a
great deal less, money, and she is compelled to
work for many hours longer. Her work-room
is generally over-crowded and badly-ventilated
—very often badly-lighted as well. She is
frequently obliged to toil on without proper
intervals of rest long hours beyond the time for
which she is supposed to be paid. In such a
place she sometimes eats her lunch without
leaving her seat, and then immediately resumes
her work, hurrying on in order to be earlier
released, for she knows from bitter experi-
ence that when a job cannot be completed
within the regular working day, but may
possibly be completed before midnight, 7, S,
9, or even I 1 o’clock, may find her still
frantically plying her needle. The Government
Statistician laments the possible effect on the
morals of young girls of compelling them to
traverse without protection the midnight streets
of a large city, and the injury inflicted on their
bodily health, as very obvious evils :
After bending for ten or twelve hours over their sewing,
girls are too weary to have much appetite for their food,
and on the morrow they rise unrefreshed to face thesanie
monotonous routine of excessive toil, with insufficient
food, rest, and exercise. Saturday is frequently the most
trying day of all, because, expecting to be free at one
o’clock, they take no lunch with them, and on such
occasions it is an ordinary occurrence that they pass y’ e
whole day, from the morning till the evening meal, with-
out refreshment of any kind. It is therefore not to he
wondered at that few of the girls are robust, or that
many exhibit signs of delicate health. . . . In lafff®
establishments the regular hours are sometimes observed
in one room and not in another, because the power to
keep the girls overtime rests largely in the hands of the
forewoman of each room, who is expected to obtain a
fixed result on the work done. The one-sidedness toe
contract between employers and employed in this in-
dustry is well exemplified in certain establishments,
w here the girls are fined half-a-day’s pay if they are ten
minutes late in the morning, and fined again on in®
flimsiest pretext, but, on the other hand, are compelieu
to work overtime without pay, and also in slack fi me Lu e
accept compulsory holidays on the same terms.
greatest sufferers iu this direction are those entire*!
dependent on their earnings for subsistence, the exigei j
cies of whose position silence their protests and conip
them to submit to what they know to be injustice an
oppression. . . Payment for overtime is seldom offer
even in cases where extra hours are most common,
employers claiming that, since the workers are som ■
times absent and no deduction from their pay is made t
public holidays, they may reasonably be expected to
extra work when it is required.
From the foregoing it may readily be seen tha
the dressmaker’s life is anything but a happy
one. As an apprentice, she usually serve 8
without pay for the first half-year, and receives
2s. 6d. a week for the second, finishing * iel
term of apprenticeship (generally two years) on
a remuneration of ss. a week. In large retai
establishments the average wage for skn >
bodice, and sleeve hands is 17s. 3d. ; in dress
makers’ shops, 15s. ; in small
retail shops, 13s. Bd. per week Assistants
home-workers earn an average of 9s. 7d.» an 1

The girls are said to be, generally speaking,
heroically moral. The report is especially, and
• tly severe on those who insert in the daily
uaners lying advertisements for numbers of
assistants of various grades although they
really want none, and this simply for the pur-
pose of conveying a false impression of the
magnitude of their business.
# * *
The milliner is socially higher than the dress-
maker, and again, of course, makes less money.
But this is not so bad as it at first appears,
because most girls who engage in this business
have comfortable homes, and mainly desire to
learn how to trim their own hats. The lowest
deep of all is reached by the “ white work
slave, the woman who has served no regular
apprenticeship, who has, as a rule, seen heltei
days,” and who desires to conceal the, fact
that she works for a living. these poor
creatures hardly ever know the names of the
(inns for whom they slave. The work is
delivered to them by a man who drives round
in a buggy, and who pushes one bundle round
the door and takes another away with him.
His thrall may have all the responsibilities of
supporting a family, and is, in addition to the
twelve or thirteen hours devoted to the service
of the needle, is obliged to do the entire work of
the household. One poor creature wrought for
six days, twelve hours a day, to make a dozen
children’s pinafores. For this she received the
sum of 2s. 3d. Theaveragenetweekly wage of the
home-worker is 11s. 9d., and she usually starves
at the rate of Bd. per diem, on slops, which she
calls tea, and bread with a scrape of butter on
it. She eats at her work—if it can be called
eating—and her digestive apparatus becomes so
depraved that meat would be a luxury her
weak stomach could not possibly retain. She
is diaphanous, dreamy, transparent. The
power of lifting has long left her. No muscular
exertion is possible, and the blood has dried up
in her veins. She does not live —she lingers.
A factory girl on white-work may earn 10s. a
week; seldom more than 15s. Excluding
cutters and forewomen, the average wages of
the employes in the shirtmaking industry
amount to 11s. 4d. per week. Homeworkers
employed in the manufacture of Crimean and
woollen shirts and flannel vests, on piecework
for white-work factories, average 11s. fid. a
■ week, or less than per hour. The highest
recorded weekly earning was 15s. for 60 hours,
and the lowest Bs. for 40 hours. The laundress
earns good wages, but it takes a strong woman
to do the work. The domestic servant is better
off than any woman who plies a needle, but
there are a variety of reasons why every woman
who earns her living does not do so by domestic
service. At all events, sufficient has been said
to show that we, in Australia, are rapidly
approaching a condition of things paralleled
only in cities like London and New York —we
have imported their industrial system —and
now we shall sit down and wait for it to grind
out its own damnation.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The N.S.W. Saving's Bank.
ijAST week a run started upon the Savings name
of New South Wales—almost the only sound
institution of its kind in the province—and for
two days a howling mob raged round the doors
of the office, and climbed frantically over each
other’s heads to get their money or die in the
attempt. It was a wonderful scene while it
lasted, and wonderfully illustrative of the hope-
less, incurable ignorance of the average
depositor— of the man who is to be given by
the ‘"National” Association a vote for his
‘‘ thrift.” The New South Wales Savings Bank
is so affluent that it recently lent the Govern-
ment £600,000 in hard cash ; it is managed by
people unconnected with Sunday-schools; it has
about £1,500,000 on deposit in other banks, and
the leading financial institutions backed their
faith in it by undertaking to casli Savings Bank
deposits to any extent over their own counters.
The Premier announced that t he resources of
the public Treasury were at the bank’s disposal
if they were wanted. A huge notice on the
door of the suspected office set forth, that
it would keep open for three hours beyond the
customary time of closing, and would pay
everybody in gold ; and yet the crowd rushed
in with never a break till at 10.15 p.m. the door
was shut for the night, and then those who
remained still unpaid sat down to weep tears of
despair in the gutter. All through the day
the police were busy rescuing trodden-on
depositors from beneath the feet of the
frenzied crowd and saving fat women in terra-
cotta plush who had got impaled on
the railings in their efforts to climb over.
AH through the night, too, they hovered
nbout, for the depositors sat around on the
edge of the pavement till long after midnight,
nr stood staring aimlessly at the windows,
home who succeeded during the day in drawing
put the savings of a life-time came out rejoic-
mg—and had their pockets picked on the pave-
ment. A lot more rescued their money and
came out saying, ‘Thank God!” —and no
doubt, straightway, in the fullness of their
hearts, went and deposited the assets with
801110 “land bank,” headed by a deacon
renowned for his piety. A lot more, being
unable to ght in, sold their deposits at a huge
discount to some speculative Hebrew who was
cunning a,little three-ball industry of bis own
iu the gutter. Rut the most melancholy
feature of it all was the fact that the
managers of at least one Labour union were
among the earliest to withdraw their account.
Presumably, because they are managers, they
are a shade more intelligent than the mere
rank-and-file of the Union, and if the leaders of
such an organisation know so very little, the
ignorance of the followers must be something
pitiable to contemplate. The whole proceeding
is a miserable commentary on the proposal to
start a Labour Bank, managed by, and for the
exclusive benefit of, the working - classes.
The New South Wales Savings Bank
is, practically, a Labour Bank, with the
additional security of enormous support from
other classes of the community and from the
Government, and the labouring classes did
their level best to pull it down at the first
breath of unfounded suspicion. If it had been
exclusively their own institution they would
have succeeded. No bank can stand being
rushed by all its customers at once, and judging
by last week’s experience that is just what might
readily happen to the Labour Bank in a very
early stage of its career. Moreover, the event
suggests that the public doesn’t like accurate
balance-sheets. The New South Wales Savings
Bank proves, by its balance, that it can pay
225. in the £ ; if it had been an utterly rotten
and fraudulent establishment, it would pro-
bably have issued a document showing that it
had a profit balance of £1,000,000, and was in a
position to pay 30 per cent, on deposits, and
with that obvious lie before them the depositors
would have been quite content. A hook-nosed
adventurer who promises 30 per cent, always
appeals to the finer feelings of the nation more
than a reliable institution which pays four,
declines to receive more than five and a half,
and steadfastly refuses to lend a red cent on
wooden house's.
“General Confidence,”
The Victorian “National Association” of big
money-grubbers has resolved to appeal to the
sympathies of the Australian toiler in a series
of pamphlets, carefully written down to the
presumed level of his intelligence. It calls
these productions “ Plain Facts for Workers,”
probably because they are not plain, neither
are they facts. The first of the series is now
before us : it is a strange collection of fusty
platitudes, and old, blue-moulded aphorisms,
and dried statements, and it is entitled “ Causes
of Prosperity.” The writer begins by slamming
down this problem :
“ Now, what is the corner-stone of public prosperity ?”
Then he answers his own question in the old,
memorable lie that has boomed along for so
many ages:
Every reader who looks beyond his nose will say at once:
“ General confidence !” For what does that imply? A
willingness on the part of capitalists to lay out their
money in enterprises that promise a profitable rate of
interest. And what follows from such an unlocking of
money ? Employment! regular and steady employment
at high rates of remuneration ; and is not this precisely
what the worker wants? Whether he uses his hands or
his brains, are not “work and wages ” his main object
and reward?
In other words, “general confidence” is the
one thing that keeps the world moving. When
everybody has confidence then things are
universally prosperous. The Labour-party, all
over Australia, is seeking to destroy “con-
fidence.” Everybody who wants a rise of wages
is destroying “ confidence.” So are the people
who want to abolish plural voting—in fact, con-
fidence is the one thing needful, and if any single
monopoly is interfered with, this great essential
at once goes to pot. And yet somehow, when
the world has confidence—which happens now
and then, in spasms —it “ gets left ” worse than
when it hasn’t it. The alleged “ corner-stone
of public prosperity ” is the most ruinous thing
that ever happens to the working classes. It
was when they had confidence that they lent
their money to Matthias Larkin, and that
saint swallowed it up. It was public confidence
that led them to take shares in the Premier
Permanent, and the Northumberland Banking
Co., and to leave their deposits with Messrs.
Bell and Davis, and to plunge heavily in the
Land Credit Bank, and to buy hopeless allot-
ments with bad titles from all manner of
Sunday-school superintendents, now in gaol.
“ General confidence ” isn’t a willingness on the
part of capitalists to lay out their money ;” it
is an opportunity for capitalists to scoop in
other people’s money. It lasts just as long as
the masses will lend their money to the capita-
list ; when they stop lending the confidence
game bursts. It always bursts, in fact. Then
when the great boom has gone wrong, and the
poor people who had confidence are cleaned
out, and the people they confided in have Hed
with the proceeds, there is an era of depres-
sion, and the “National Association” says
that it is owing to want of confidence,
arising from wicked agitators, and “ One-Man-
One- Vote” Bills, and similar nefarious proceed-
ings. Vet it would be a vast amount better
for the nation if it never had “confidence.”
There is an almost superhuman gall in the
plaint of the Association about the want of
public faith, seeing that the faith is invariably
misplaced. If the “National Association”
can show one case in all commercial history
when any nation has had what it defines as
“ general confidence,” and hasn’t been hideously
swindled as a consquence, we would be glad to
hear of it.

The Customs v. the Country.
The Melbourne Customs authorities, stimulated
to activity by a steady decline in their “ col-
lections,” have lately been raiding the premises
of sundry manufacturers and merchants con-
cerned in what is practically an advancement
of the protective policy of Victoria. A seizure
of “ German ” lager beer brewed at Collingwood
was the first feat accomplished by the Customs
in this new direction. Secondly, the vigilant
enforcers of the Trade Marks Act descended
upon the Denton Mills Hat Company and
annexed a few gross of “ tiles ” that purported
to be of best English make. In each instance
the parties involved have been guilty of
attempting to mislead the public as to the
birthplace of certain goods. A similar infringe-
ment of the Act can no doubt be proved against
local manufacturers and vendors of boots, t ies,
and sundry other necessaries. Hut as the
public, taking only a superficial view of these
seizures, are apt to think them directed by a
stern moral regard for the commonwealth,
it is just as well to point out that the
Customs people play a purely selfish
hand. Strictly speaking, their object in
seizing sham “imported” articles is to in-
crease the bona-fide foreign trade which pro-
duces the revenue of their particular depart-
ment. In the case of hats, boots, &c., there is no
question as to the action of the Customs being
inspired by Government official rather than by
public interests. Colonial felt, shellac, soles and
“ uppers ” are not injurious to the health, and
even though they be made factors in a deception
practised upon that section of the community
which prefers Hinglish goods for the sake of the
Hinglisli name, the moral fraud is not one that
any patriotic Australian will object to. The
Anglomaniac must be catered for. If he accepts
hats made in Melbourne as the product of his
beloved mother country, so much the better for
Protection. If, on the other hand, the guileless
creature who loves to think that his headgear
comes from London is to have the Government
keeping a vigilant eye open to see that he gets
it—so much the worse for the local industry.
Lager beer, which compares favourably with
the German original in taste, and is equally un-
objectionable, may surely be sold as such
to the benefit of the makers, the unsuspect-
ing consumers, and the country at large. Let
the Customs seizers confine their atten-
tion to the exorcising of evil spirits and
encourage the manufacture of pure Austra-
lian whisky until it will no longer be
necessary for a man who considers his health
to pay duty on the imported lotion, which
is at present so lamentably superior. Bogus
British hats don’t injure a man’s head, but
imported whisky adulterated with Australian
poison has the effect of making it swell badly.
There’s where the Customs ought to come in for
the benefit of the public —and don’t.
Snobbery Organises.
A delirium of sectional organisation has seized
hold of Australian communities. Therehave been
class-organisations, cross-organisations, inter-
organisations, dovetail-organisations, obverse-
cam-reverse organisations, and every other sort
of organisations. The latest is a Melbourne
spume that frothed itself into visibility at a
meeting “to form an association of an anti-
socialistic character amongst young business
men.” There is a fine humour about this phrase
which calls to mind the late Marcus Clarke’s
essay “ On Business Men,” who, he says, “are
the cream of the social bowl—in their own
estimation.”—
You may be the best fellow in the world, the sole sup-
port of an aged mother, and the protector of a whole
boarding-schoolfull of orphan sisters. You may work
like a horse, and give all your goods to feed the poor, but
if you are not a Business Man, you are sounding brass, or
a tinkling cymbal. To be a Business Man is a special
gift—a sort of inherent virtue, like a cast in the eye. If
you are a Business Man, you will succeed in Business —
that is to say, you will be a good husband, a fond father,
a conscientious Christian, always vote with the Govern-
ment, and, when you die, you will go straight to heaven.
If you are a Business Man, people will shout for you, the
papers will write you up, and your friends will give you
prayer-books with gilt-edges.
The Victorian “young business men” have
combined, as Mr. Meudell (son of a banking-
magnate) intimated, because “the black-coat
section of the community suffered as much as
the trades.” It seems supererogatory to organise
snobbery, for snobs always stick together under
any set of circumstances. The same sort of
bastard gentility causes counter-jumpers, and
store-clerks, and calf-padded flunkeys, and
barbers’ mates, and the hair-oiled sections
generally, to roll up whenever corpulent em-
ployers sound the tocsin against men in mole-
skins. The meeting was rather spoilt by a
motion for the formation of “ a political asso-
ciation of young Victorian citizens.” How
“young” must a member be? How much
“Victorian ” ? How much a “ citizen ” ? These
conundrums require a special black-coat solu-
tion, since the black-coat glossary is incompre-
hensible to the ordinary artisan whose horny-
handed, moleskin-lined wages are, in most
cases, much greater than the pittance of the
servile, yet vain, black-coated quill-driver, or
tape-measurer. E. Jowett’s subsequent reso-
lution, however, defined the position clearly—
“ Determined resistance is to be offered to the
proposals of the leaders of the so-called Labour-
party.” It matters not what those proposals
may be —even though they were for the emanci-
pation of the helpless, hopeless, black-coated
brigades themselves —whatever emanates from
the man who soils his hands with manual labour
is “ pizen ” to the black-coated snob, whose
miserable servitude only affords him the hollow
satisfaction that he is expected to possess
neither brains nor grit, nor required to begrime
his cuffs. Let us whoop for organised snobbery.
There is one w T ay, and only one, to restore
confidence in the financial institutions of Aus-
tralia. Let a detective—or, if needful, a staff
of detectives —be attached to each one, and let
him search every director, manager, clerk or
auditor every time he goes out, and if he finds
upon him any cash or documents which might
possibly belong to the bank, let him confiscate
them and deposit them with the Government,
pending an enquiry. If necessary, he should be
authorised to undress the director or other officer
and inspect him by means of a microscope, and
also to feel for documents in his ears and in the
lining of his clothes. There must be only one
exit from the office —through the detective’s
room ; the windows must be barred ; and any
director or manager seen escaping over the roof
must be made liable to be shot at there and
then. No customer must be allowed to com-
municate with an officer of the bank except in
the presence of a detective, and, if neces-
sary, the latter must be authorised to
search the customer also. The office keys
must be kept by the police. The detective
who looks after things must also be searched
six times a day by a Government auditor, and
the Government auditor should be inspected at
frequent intervals by the Premier. All parcels
going in and out of the bank must be examined
and the officers’ lunch overhauled by the aid of
a magnifying glass. Anybody throwing any-
thing out of tiie bank window should be imme-
diately arrested on suspicion of flinging 1 lie
reserve-fund to Ins pal outside. The ash-heap
at the back must also be sifted hourly by the
police, lest notes or other securities should be
planted there and surreptitiously removed at
night by a confederate with a dray. No
manager, clerk, director, or other officer to
leave the town without finding security for his
return, and the charwoman and the coal man
must furnish bonds for their good behaviour.
If this scheme won’t produce any good results,
then the case is about hopeless.
Premier Salisbury states, as a proof of the
impossibility of Home Rule, that the majority
of the Irish people “ have always been allied to
the enemies of England.” The average sample
Bull is so miserably inflated that it never
dawns on him that the sentence might as well
read the other way about —“ the majority of
the English people have invariably been allied
to the enemies of Ireland.” Moreover, the
statement is a lie in any case, for Ireland has
done as much service in fighting the battles of
the Empire as England herself. Right up to
the time of the Crimean War Ireland supplied
four times as many troops, in proportion to
population, as England did, and Ireland, Scot-
land, and Wales furnished among them about
two-thirds of what was termed—with cheerful
mendacity—the English army.. Even away
back in the Middle Ages there was a great Irish
contingent at Cressy, and the remainder of the
alleged English army on that fateful occasion
was mostly Normans and Gascons. An Irish
army was imported to prop up the English
Crown in the Wars of the Roses, when England
herself wouldn’t fight worth a cent. There
never was a British Empire until the time when
Irish and Scotch soldiers were pressed into the
English army ; England, while travelling on her
own account, inherited an empire on the Con-
tinent of Europe, and had neither the strength
nor the brains to keep it, and she afterwards
started at least four foreign empires and lost
them all. Salisbury ought to read up the
history of his country over again. It was a
remarkably poor, mean country till it got the
loan of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales to fight
its battles and prop it up generally. And now
that the loan is being withdrawn it is likely to
be a very poor, mean country again. The Irish
contingent was once nearly 80,000. Twenty -
five years ago it was 50,000. Now it is 28,000.
The Scotch forces are evaporating in the same
way because the Highlands are depopulated by
landlordism, and the Highlanders used to be
the flower of the “ English” army. The Scotch
and Irish troops both began to diminish rapidly
after the Crimea, and since the Crimea Britain
hasn’t raised enough military glory to surprise
its grandmother with.
"O’ "
The Age sneers at the Labour Party in the
coming Victorian elections as people “about
whom we hear very much, and of whom', when
it is all over, we are likely to hear very little.
But the same journal derided the chances of
Trenwith and Hancock before they were re-
turned to Parliament, and many better-liked and
trusted labour candidates than the aforesaid
pair will be going to the poll in April. Maybe,
too, they will pull through without the assist-
ance of an “ organ.” Everybody is beginning
to understand that the Melbourne daily press
represents only rotten “interests, and is
practically the voice of the loyal land-boomer,
exhorting the country to keep its paths crooked.
“ I never knew a candidate to be carried in by
the Age,” says one of Melbourne’s oldest poli-
ticians, “ although he is often pushed in by the
opposition of the Argus.” Now the animosity
of both journals at once should give a great
moral impetus to the enemy.
Melbourne Age has gone back on democratic
liberalism and exhibits itself as the Catiline o*
Australian politics. It transparently opposes
the vital democratic plank of One-man-one-
vote by seeking to make its readers forget and
ignore the existing sectional conspiracy to
establish a dual vote—“ one vote for manhood
and one for thrift,” as the blundering and
plundering gag goes. Speaking about the arti-
ficial hole-and-corner “ push ” known as the
Victorian “country party,” the Age says :
The platform of this party may be said to consist of two
planks—the stock tax and retrenchment in the civil
service.
Not a word about its chiefest aim, the object
nearest the political gizzard of the scheming
politicians who have invented this “country
party ” —a dual vote for Proputty. However,
the workers of Victoria have no blind side on
which the Age can get in this vital matter.
Labour-member Hancock, carried Collingwood
in the teeth, and probably because of the
venomous opposition of the mighty penny daily,
and workers all over the province should be
prepared to show Dictator Same that his politi-
cal power vanished when lie deserted democracy
in order, to support syndicates, to boom monopo-
lies, and to overbalance the franchise of the
workers by giving secret aid to the duality of
the voting power of Property.
During the trial of W. P. Smairl, of Sydney,
last week for embezzlement, some curious facts
came out. One of them was the statement by
the bland and gentlemanly auditor that
“certified to the correctness of the accounts,’
but didn’t count the cash—which, as it hap-
pened, was £lOll 7s. 4d. short. The other
auditor, apparently, counted the cash and
never observed the shortage, so, between the
man who didn’t look at the deficiency and the
man who didn’t see it when he did look at it,
the shareholders of the Imperial Building
Society have gone where the good shareholder
goes —into the soup. A Melbourne society
which burst lately made even a worse dis-
covery : the borrowers’ ledger hadn’t been
written up for two years, and seemingly the
auditors had never observed the circumstance.
They professed, of course, to have gone over the
book and examined every separate entry, and
yet they weren’t even conscious that there were
no entries to examine. Apparently this kind
of an auditor doesn’t enter the office at all, but
simply hands in through the window his little
certificate stating that everything is quite
accurate, and has his fee thrown to him over
the back gate, and goes away quite content.
Wanted, ofir' 1 auditors, criminally liable for

816 Maoquarie-street North, Sydney, Feb. 17,1892.
My Dear Moorabinda,—
If there is one thing in the world that makes me
smile behind my gauze fan, as depicted above
(I’ve had it a long time, haven’t I ?), it is to
hear the Sydney she-Suffragists crying aloud in the
wilderness, proclaiming their “advanced opinions”
—their peculiar aptitude for striking out in all sorts of
familiar directions-their stern contempt for the every-
day woman who has no Ideas - with a six-foot I. Because,
in sober truth, the Suffragists are a sheepy mob—one
woman’s opinion is their opinion, as anybody knows who
attends a Rights seance and watches the way the applause
goes. You have only to he “Lady” So-an’-So, and the
meeting lifts up both feet and its brass-shod gamp to
drive your namby-pambyisms home every time you open
your mouth—and what a Title disapproves of, the whole
surge of untrammelled feminine intellects disapprove of
at sight without asking any questions. It is pitiable.
More, it is sickening.
Apropos -at a recent pow-wow of the league the
lecturess rose on her Paris heels and wrestled with a
“ devil’s dozen ” of the objections agin the universal vote.
Some, she said, were too flippant to be heeded; for
instance, the reluctance of one woman to join in because
the members seemed (sonpturally enough) to take no
manner of heed wherewith they should be clothed. It
certainly was an objection to be counted out, for any
thinking woman would enlist under the banner of a scare-
crow with a commendable cause - but then only a handful
of people take the league seriously, and anything does for
an objection. A league canvasser told me that one woman
“didn’t think she would,” because she had to take two
trams to get to the place of worship, and another—a
woman, mind you—had the audacity to hack out
“because there was too much talking.” But, harking back,
the league does get itself up in a rather marked manner—
for business reasons, I suppose, just as a musician never
gets his hair clipped, and an artistalways sports a soft ’at.
But you can overdo eccentricity of outer shell. I re-
member herding up Hunter-street behind a leaguist once
who had caught all her waving petticoats too high at the
hack, and the result was a rather embarrassing perspec-
tive of cloudy white stockings ending in venerable boots ;
and when ray fascinated eye got to her bonnet I couldn’t
help wondering if the meeting had stood her on her head
in the corner for seditious utterances at the last stance.
Obviously women don’t want the franchise ; if they did
they would take a dfal more interest in municipal elec-
tions over which lady-householders are called upon by
local jacks-out-of-office and begged to vote them in again.
It is odd that when even the most companionable
member of Parliament starts in a train for anywhere, he
will descend to abject fibs to get a carriage to himself.
For instance, at Redfern the other day, a well-known
member hung out of a carriage-window, and told those
who approached that it was full to suffocation. They put
credence in his statement (you can’t tell members at
sight) and passed on, hut at last came a man who, seeing
there was room for three in the carriage, gently got in
and sat down. “You can’t sit there—that Walter’s seat,”
said the M.P. from his post of guard at the door, but the
stranger had been there before, and so only smiled fitfully
and settled himself comfortably—at least until Walter
came. But Walter never did come, and the journey was
a peaceful one after all, for the interloper had his seat
and was happy, and no M.P. is ever “ disconcerted” at
being bowled out in a little “ expediency ” like that.
Per printed report I gather that Melbourne Austral
Salon is still flourishing at the top of Uollins-street, with
a bank surplus, too, of three figures, and a sequential air
of joyousness in the region of the till. Yet I harbour a
ghastly dread that the Salon is slowly allowing its
appetite to become its god, for in the list of receipts,
innocently side by side, are the suggestive announce-
ments :
Sale of refreshments .. £9 17 7
Sale of stationery .... 56
Nine pounds twelve and a penny more for pastry than for
pens and ink!
Which reminds me that when the Manly flower-show
authorities sat down to cold, emotionless numerals the
other day, it transpired that there had been a loss on the
refreshments Of nine and a penny. However, I don’t
wonder at that. In a tea-and-cake tent given to amateur
waitresses in fetching clothes you always have to give
chase to the lady who waits upon you ere you can settle
with her. And everybody isn’t honest even at a flower-
show.
A lady just returned from ’Ome tells a story of an
English female, a frock-builder by trade, who had been
four years in India., coming aboard as a second-class
passenger at Colombo, and having to share a cahih with
some people returning to Adelaide. Almost ere the
steamer had started a female voice was heard expostulat-
ing on deck, and at last the new passenger burst in upon
the ship’s purser with the force of an enraged cyclone:
“Purser, I must have my cabin changed,” she gasped.
“ Why, what is the matter—isn’t there room where you
are?” “ Oh, yes, there is room enough,” said the lady
with acid emphasis, “ but I really am not accustomed to
‘•ravelling with Australians.”
Madame Weigal’s fashion fads for February enshrine
nothing which the woman with a now dress in her eye
will rush forth after a paper pattern of, but the sketches
of young ladies wear most of their dresses below high-
collar-bone mark, and I sincerely trust that isn’t a sign of
the times. For only one throat in a thousand will bear
unveiling, and the virgin who is no longer as young as
she would like to be simply hangs out the date of her
nativity when she allows her long lute-stringed gullet to
poke too far out of her collar.
Italian opera at Freetrade prices oped conspicuously at
Sydney Royal last Saturday. There wasn’t much “dress-
ing” in the circle, for this is the time when the d.c.
seraph’s garment generally reveals the dust of many
sweepings on the tip of its trail. Carrie Swain was in
white hroidered chiffon aggravated with diamonds and a
white plume fan, and was perhaps the most observable
personage. On the stage, Elvira wore three expensive
garments, but the women always do look guys in grand
opera because their frocks must be either chronological
or nondescript. A songstress can’t very well come out
dressed up to date to canoodle with a lover in doublet
and jack-boots, can she ? And if you dress to
enhance his antiquoness, it’s ten to one the femi-
nine fashions of a.d. ever so far back will only
make- the gallery “ chyak.” Therefore, Elvira wore
plain-cut non-committal garments—the first one of a sur-
prising greenness which made you think of Erin-go-
bragb; the second a white satin bridal dress (fortunately
worn without those yards and yards of mosquito-net
which make the stage-bird such a roundabout lump of
love) made perfectly plain and without ornament, and
the effect soothed. But in the third act (where Elvira
has a very bad time, you remember) to her black frock
was added a spray of flowers—a bit of coquetry no really
badgered female would ever dream of—for instance, don’t
you always doubt the grief of a widow who haunts hubby’s
little tomb on Sundays with carefully banged hair and a
white rose entangled in the buttons of her bodice ? La
Guidotti got a shower of floralities at the conclusion of
“Ernani Inviolami”—which reminds me that Ernani was
like a Valentine in scarlet and gold, and the two wicked
old gentlemen wore black necessarily. On the stage
people always wear black when they want to look old, or
virtuous—words sometimes synonymous.
In “Faust,” at Her Majesty’s, the actor-men have the
cream of the wardrobe—Jewett’s lovely get-up of blue
and gold brocade doublet, slashed with gold silk, worn
with electric-blue trunks and a cloak of electric-blue
plush, barred with velvet, was like something you dream
of, hut seldom see, except at a fancy-dress ball on a
pimply youth with champagne-bottle shoulders and
padded calves, and then, of course, you don’t notice it.
As the inflammable Marguerite, Kate Bishop (she gets
her face up to perfection, by the way) rang the changes
on virgin-white and electric-grey, slashed with mull—
only I must object to her sporting the same pair of
shoes from start to finish. They are dear little shoes
with glittering buckles, hut all the same one likes to think
that Maggie changed her hoots now and then. Mephisto.
(it sounds personal, but I must say that Mr. Rignold
makes a realistic devil) glowed like a live coal in scarlet
and black, and the yanking up’ards of Marguerite to the
strains of Heavenly music was charmingly done. By the
way, why is Heavenly music always soprano, while the
melodies of Tartarus are set in the bars clef ? Is there
any visible connection between virtue and treble register?
I think not. No, dear, I think not.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

And, if she would not give it, steal it.

On Saturday last at Sydney Royal the
Italian Opera Company opened a four weeks’
season with “Ernani.” The house was crowded,
and the treasurer sat, like Matthew, at the
receipt of custom, a dazzling vision of glittering
gems and snowy shirt-front. There is some
subtle and occult connection between diamonds
and Italian opera, the mystery of which we are
still engaged in unravelling. Likewise, no one
who is anyone—unless he happen to be a press-
man or a policeman—dares sit amidst the elect in
the dress-circle in any other than the garb of the
waiter, for it is impossible to understand Verdi’s
music unless you are sitting awkwardly and self-
consciously on a crumpled swallow-tail. However,
there was a great deal of enthusiasm pervading
the atmosphere ; floral tributes—not necessarily
provided by the management —were occasionally
hurled with manifestations of delirious joy at
Signorina Guidotti, much delight was expressed
by hand-clappiug, several press people appeared
solemn and ostentatiously read opera-scores, and
Potts’ Point and Elizabeth Bay looked highly
edified and unspeakably bored, and wondered
what the deuce it was all about, you know.
# # *
“Ernani” is a sad and solemn thing to
contemplate. Its main interest is the pursuit of
a lady, named Elvira, by three bearded pirates—
one of whom is a bandit, and another a king,
though there isn’t much difference —and the sur-
render of a penny trumpet upon which bangs a
life. Some men wither and are gathered to their
fathers at a breath of air—poor Ernani wilts sadly
and hands in his checks at the blast of a bugle.
There is also a tomb in the piece, and taking it all
round it is moderately cheerful and eminently
reassuring, Signorina Guidotti is a magnificent
Elvira of superb dimensions, whom it is impossible
to behold without loving. She is a Spaniard, we
are told, though if you didn’t see her you would
conclude that she was a nightingale. The Ernani
of this production is also a Spaniard. On the
play-bill he is called a dramatic tenor. He acts
fairly well, but he strains too much after effect in
his singing. He forgets that “ Ernani ” was
written purely in the interests of “ Carlo Magno,”
King of Spain. Signor Melossi, the potentate in
question, is a fine baritone with a powerful and
sympathetic voice, and he may fairly be considered
as having all the unguent of the show, although a
little falls to the basso, Signor Travaglini, who
lias a stage presence reminiscent of Bondi,
The conductor, Signor Napoleone Maffezzoli,
works like a veritable Trojan, and has a
capital orchestra well under his control. The
principals and chorus are well dressed, and the
different productions are admirably mounted and
staged, and altogether so cheap a presentation of
operas of the calibre now given to the public
could not be witnessed in Italy itself. By the
way, touching the tomb-,scene —when Pimazzoni
played “Carlo Magno,” he emerged from the
grisly vault in a dazzling suit of silver mail, and
the effect was simply electric, the conspirators
appearing to be genuinely justified in taking the
tin-plated monarch for the ghost of the defunct
Charlemagne. On Tuesday, “ Lucia di Laniraer-
moor ” was produced with an entirely different
cast, the personnel of which shall have our par-
ticular attention in a future issue,

At Sydney Her Majesty’s, “Faust” lias
replaced the anonymous drama of “Forty-Nine,”
and Maggie Moore dances no more the sand-jig
of her sires. “Faust” is a very fine production.
The painting of the cathedral leaves nothing to be
desired, and the incidental music and the lime-
light are exceedingly good of their kind. Every
child should be taken to see “Faust” at the
earliest opportunity, for it is calculated to destroy
all fear or reverence for the “ Bogey Man ” men
have agreed for several centuries to pile their sins
upon. Mr. George Rignold’s devil is hale and
fat, and he cannot get about very rapidly. He
has a low comedy nose and an American goatee.
His laugh belongs to the bold, bad man of modern
melodrama, and he behaves generally as a cheap
conjuror in a dime museum, rather than a renegade
angel with serious business on hand. Goethe
created a splendid fiend who clothed nis spirit
with the thoughts of evil that existed in the minds
of those he tempted. He assumed the guise they
wished, or their own peculiar wicked desires sug-
gested. Mr. Gilbert Horatio Parker has travestied
and tortured Goethe’s sublime creation into a
mountebank in a red cloak, with a transpontine
laugh, who wanders about market-places mesmer-
ising little children and setting beggars by the
ears. Mr. Rignold’s Mephistopheles is consistent
throughout. Moreover, it is a clever piece of act-
ing, but after witnessing it we feel it would be a
solemn farce henceforth to consign anybody to the
devil. He can hardly be blamed for this. He
hired Mr, Parker to manufacture him a fiend,
and Mr. Parker was sparing of the material.
The author, an ex-elergyman, by the way,
hadn’t wickedness enough to clothe his ideas
in, so he made good the deficiency in limp
and laugh and limelight. After Mr. Rignold
is taken out there is hardly anybody left in this
particular edition of “ Faust not even the call-
boy. Poor Marguerite is, of course, played by
Miss Bishop, and very charmingly and pathetically
does she sustain the part, notwithstanding the
fact that she is hardly the sylph-like girl that
Goethe dreamed about. There is a change in the
Faust. It is now played by Mr. Jewett, for
which we are devoutly thankful: have we not yet
rasping in our ears the voice of brawn of Mr.
Brian Barley’s Faust ? Mr. Stirling Whyte has
let us into the secret of the German doctor’s
nationality—while he was an old man Faust was
Scotch ; when he renewed his youth he became,
in the person of Mr. Jewett, pronouncedly Aus-
tralian. A word of praise is deserved by Mr.
Hazlitt for his fine and manly acting of the
character of Valentine. Likewise the man who
runs the limelight sticks to his post and does his
duty like a hero.

At the Criterion, “Uncles and Aunts”
has/niade way for “The Solicitor,” a farcical
ccffiGdy by J. H. Barnley, the author of “The
Barijstet,” “The Balloon,” and other pieces.
“The Solicitor” is a weird and wonderful con-
strucfion'iiwhree acts and five doors, and the
doors have most of the strong lines in the piece.
The plot is a simple one. A legal man, blessed
mahsoned by a number of military f r ier,H° r
manages to got fuzzy at supper, and while i,
state of mixture is induced to lay a wager that b
will drive a neglected cab down Piccadilly oreb
where. His first fare is his wife, bis second tV '
man who stole her diamonds. This is practical!* 0
the plot, the whole plot, and nothing but thenlnf
After the matter is fairly launched, different
people begin to crop up and chip in. Thecal
man’s daughter impinges upon the scene. 8j 1P •'
followed by the brother of the wife of the solicitor 8
and ultimately the whole garrison turn out t ’
make love to her, followed by their various wives
Ihe fun culminates in a riot, in which a dress*
maker’s shape and the five doors play vigorous
and leading parts. Mr. Brough is the solicitor
and he practically runs the show. Other people
jostle up against him now and then in an enquir.
mg manner, and his wife sometimes asks him how
he is, hut generally he is walking round bullying
defenceless colonels, and making the lives of
peaceful grenadiers a burden to them. JVf r
Cannani, as a grizzled warrior of exalted rank
looks nice in a short jacket, and does his business
with an inspiring devotion to duty. Mr. Fabert
is cleverly made-up as an impossible burglar and
works his way through a small part with much
success ; while Messrs. Cates and Chichester have
a number of important military manoeuvres to
execute with more or less fidelity to mess-room
traditions. Miss Homer’s Mrs. Sterndale is an
admirable piece of acting, and Miss Bessie Major’s
Bella is a gem of purest ray serene, albeit born to
shed its lustre o’er the area pave.

J. F. Sheridan, of joious memory, has
doffed the sock of Bridget O’Brien and donned
the buskin of Jnrisprudence Marks in the wild
and wondrous bur 1 esque comedy tragedy drama of
“Lncle Tom’s Cabin,” with extras. There’s
more nigger than hymn-book, and more Topsy
than whip in the present version, and Legree
without entirely being a land-shark or a clergy’-
man, is still villainous enough to inspire a whole-
some abhorrence in the public mind, and-little
Bva is so sweet that everybody is glad when she

The Polytechnic, the Cyclorama, and
several other places of amusement are still open,
and there is a marked and growing desire on the
part of several other places of ainu-ement to be
open if they could. Sunday concerts are flourish-

suburbs, and- er—altogether theatrical matt rs
have wonderfully improved since the imposition
of the new customs duties.

It would not surprise us to learn that the
tug-of-war strike was suggested to the competing
teams by the associated theatrical managers of
Sydney, who are now put very much in the same
position as they were by the Pain’s fireworks
exhibitions. Parallel the risks: the theatrical
manager is obliged to lease an expensive theatre
for a term of months or years, to engage stars at
high salaries, to provide an orchestra, a staff of
carpenters, scene-painters, house-hands and ticket-
takers, and to become responsible for the whole
enormous expenditure of running a large establish-
ment with no other certainty of success than popular
caprice. The tug-of-war promoter, on the other
hand, is obliged to rent a hall for a series of per-
formances stretching over only a week or ten days,
to hire an ordinary band, and to put up two or
three hundred pounds prize-money (which, con-
sidering the novelty and the minimum of risk and
expense, he should be able to borrow on the
security of a percentage of the takings). Four
prizes only are offered, and all the beaten team?
are practically put in the position of providing the
public with amusement at their own personal loss
—this means 80 men engaged night after night
with no possible prospect of remuneration.
Theatrical managers never get a “ throw in ” such
as this. The promoters of the tug of-war urge,
however, that the men should compete solely from
motives of patriotism. Patriotism is evidently
becoming one of the last refuges of management.

At the Opera House, on Monday night,
George Musgrove’s variety show was received
with mingled feelings of astonishment and pain.
Naturally, the Graggs raised a genuine furore by
the skill with which they tossed their unwhole-
some small boy from foot to foot. The Graggs’
aot throughout was recognised as the perfection of
muscular art, also Carl Hertz, a trickster of
ren wn. opened the eyes of everybody to every-
thing save the way in which it was done, although
some of the charm of his rather protracted enter-
tainment is lost in a large theatre. Of the so-
called illusions, invented by Hertz, the newest is
not an illusion strictly speaking, inasmuch as the
metamorphosis of a man into a girl is perpetrated
behind curtains. What the eye can’t see, the optic
can’t be deluded by. It was with the incidental
performances of Fred. Mason, Rose Bearing aim
the Fairy Four that the pain came in. As items
in a music-hall bill or a pantomime they fid a .
want, but when they lack the glamour of a go l '
geous scene and have to face an audience who
can’t appeal to a bottle between the verses these
artists seem sad and wearisome. They will not
bear considering in cold blood, for which reason
mainly, but also because of a general want or
briskness, the new show as a whole fell some-
what flat on Monday. A comic ballet brought
matters to a fairly cheerful conclusion, but the
congregation dispersed in an ominously quiet and
unobtrusive manner. ,
** * *
“La Cigale,” which duly put in a &’ st
southern appearance at the Princess’s, on Satur-
day, promises to remain the show of Melbourne
for several weeks to come. The fierce light that
beats upon a comic opera reveals much that is
rich and rare in the production of this latest
novelty, and regarded as a feast for the eye it 19
verily a sumptuous repast. Six fair dancers,
assisted by one dark ditto, triumph over many
difficulties with their legs, alike in breezy rura
districts and in the highly perfumed salon, where
they trip to the strains of an orchestra of ladm 9 ,
who fiddle away like ministering angels m ,
balcony built for that purpose. There is dancing)
too, in the market-place, all amongst the orange
peel and nut-shells, and here a nimble little fay
constructed on the lightest possible lines, make-
the greybeards wag with admiration. Moreover
and more particularly, the music of coinp°®. e
Audran is frequently fascinating, occasionally
very fine, and always good quality. The open l )',,
takes precedence of the comic in
which bears only a superficial resemblance

Mention of a ducal ass in hideous wearing

u.j'/'/li'u"' eminence on the lyric stage. The duke

U her gaudy “boy” to assume a devouring
mssion for another girl, and his choice falls
lion the heroine. The chevalier’s pretence of
mssion soon grows into such a devouring
reality that ho would fain eat the dim, leav-
the duchess to be consumed by jealousy.
The upshot is a row in the palace, and a sudden
fainting away of the prima donna, whereupon the
s 't i n 'e darkens and the audience see the vision that
haunts the poor girl’s swoon—a vision of how she
totters back to her old ’appy ’oine on her upper’s
and dies or something in the beautiful snow.
Vow, tho'moral English version of “La Cigale”
knocks all sense and meaning out of the aforesaid
vision, which would seem to be intended as a
warning to the thriftless light-o’-loves. Evidently
it' doesn’t apply to the present situation. The
shadows gradually lifting reveal the heroine still
fainting in the place where she fell, and the
duchess is so overcome by the spectacle of her
rival’s distress that she freely gives her the
chevalier for a wedding-present, which is very
unwomanly on the duchess’ part. The termina-
tion of the opera is artistically as weak as a
fasting-man on his fortieth morning, but the plot
up to then possesses consecutive interest, and
reminds one of a hot French potato being chilled
by the icy breath of British respectability,

With Miss Marie Halfcon rested the ques-
tion ’twixt success or failure for “La Cigale,” and
that gifted new arrival decided in favour of the
former with scarce a moment’s hesitation. The
lady’s Parisian experience is delightfully apparent,
especially in a “kiss” song, which reduced the
whole house to ruins at her feet in the first act.
No ditty so cleverly interpreted as this had been
previously heard under the same sliding roof. It
is as a singing actress that Miss Halton in all her
moods soars high above the average, and creates
her most refreshing effects. Her well-trained
voice is not very strong, nor does she talk to any
particular advantage, but the intelligence of her
warble is quite unusual. Personally, Miss Halton
inclines to stoutness in moderation, though
indeed, her face, which is pretty, would bear
(fining down. Suppose we say that her general
appearance suggests an improved edition of Sig-
nora Cuttica, whilst her bearing and gestures are
strongly reminiscent of Isabel Morris. Anyway,
she is a solid success. Howard Vernon plays the
absurd dook in a style that is comparatively
fresh and new to him, and certainly carries off
second prize. Ryley, as the Chevalier, is happy
and straightforward as usual. There is never much
attention to petty details about Ryley’,s acting, but
he seems to stroll afteT the ladies as though he
liked it, and it’s always nice to see a good sort of
fellow enjoying himself. Besides, they’ve got him
up regardless of expense, and his best pair of
breeches is a twin brother to the plush curtain.
Florence Young, without a ballad to call her own,
acts the duchess prettily, and there the interest
ends. Elton, trying to brew humour of bosh, was
a dire infliction on Saturday, and will require to
touch up his part very skilfully if he wants to win
-genuine laughs. Flora Graupner gets an occa-
sional peep in, and kauri, Lissant, Elsie Cameron
■ and Violet Varley hover around at times. Allen
Morris, the new baritone, shaped unobtrusively in
.a colourless part, and as his voice, for some reason
iorother, refused to “come off,” his first appear-
ance made no difference worth mentioning. “La
'Cigale” is an opera without a tenor, and would
deserve enthusiastic support if there were nothing
else in its favour,

“ The Hobby Horse ” took a picrimiuary
canter at the Bijou, on Saturday night, and its
style of going was not encouraging to backers.
Pinero turns out hopeless plays every now and
then, crazy works of art that caricature human
nature without being comical, and seem to defy
probability out of pure cussedness. And he has
the late Mr. Boucicault’s weakness for creating
sporting characters when he knows nothing of the
sporting world. In “ Dandy Dick ” the author’s
extravagance in horsey terms and conceptions was
justified by results, but “The Hobby Horse”
hasn’t enough result to justify anything. It
w a dreary outcome of the Ibsen period, a
tiresome three-act enlargement on the simple
tact that a husband who sticks to racing has
nothing in common with a wife who sticks
’° Professional charity work, and that a
mutual sacrifice of manias is necessary to bring
their souls within speaking distance. - An attempt
to blend their fads in a religious Home for Decayed
Jockeys and blacklegs fails miserably, partly, no
uoubt, on account of the residents being an insult
t° all understanding. There is one touch of real
mature in “ The Hobby Horse.” When the lead-
'll" lady endeavours to fulfil her mission under the
t'rectum of a curate, the gentleman in holy orders
ties to mash her, but with this one commonplace
xception there is nothing satisfactory about the
v _ e business. That much of the dialogue is
‘■mart goes without saying. Its smartness only
to provoke sorrow for a waste of good in-
ntions on a worthless object. The B. and B.

The husband of Mrs. Kirby, whose son attempted her
life by throat-cutting the other night, used to keep the
theatrical bookselling shop under the “Old Vic.’ in
Pitt-st., Sydney, and was burnt out when the playhouse
went. His wife assisted in the shop and was well up in
dramatic lore. Dr. Muskett, who was called in to attend
Mrs. Kirby, is himself the son and grandson of the earliest
booksellers in Melbourne.
W. H. Pennington took his farewell of the English stage
the other day. As an actor Pennington, who has been
“ starring ” at odd times at out of the way places for
many years, was a solemn and terrible character, but he
was blessed with a useful advt. in the fact that he had
been a Balaclava ’ero. On every anniversary of that
little event Pennington is engaged somewhere or other,
to recite the Charge of the Light Brigade. The gas is
lowered and the gallant ex-dragoon mouths Tennyson’s
poem in a most impressive manner. This performance
grows more humanly interesting as the Balaclava muddle
fades into ancient history, and very soon, perhaps, old
Penny will stand in his pride alone, the sole surviving
relic of all the “ glory.” “ Honour the charge I made ! ”
he will be able to say.
Elton (says a correspondent) is not going “home”
because he has any particular love for Hingland. That
affection he had once, though, and it was cooled in this
way. He returned from the Capo, some years back,
expecting to be received as a martyr in London. But he
fell flat, nobody welcomed him, and most of the theatres
were closed. On the fifth day of his second advent he
met an old face, which nodded and went its way. “By
,” said Billy to his wife, “this won’t do.” He
followed the acquaintance (a well-known manager) and
grabbed him by the collar. Manager, coolly : “ So you’ve
returned from America, old boy.” Billy: “No.”
Manager; “From India?” Billy;' “No.” Manager:
“ Well then, from Australia.” “And I’m damned,” says
Billy, “if I hadn’t to tell him that I’d been at the Cape.
That cured me of my nostalgia.” It cost Billy £3OO to
bring his family to Australia. This is too much, audit
has been his desire for a long time to settle the wife and
youngsters in a suburb of London. When this is done, he
says, lie will either accept an engagement in London, or
turn his eyes to America.
Maculiy, professor of elocution, provided a rare trea*
for the boys at Clara Merivale’a benefit. Mac’s sample o*
elocution was probably correct enough in small details"
but as his voice didn’t travel beyond the orchestra the
trouble was to find out whether the worthy man was try-
ing to melt ’em to tears, or set the theatre in a roar. The
theatre roared, anyway, when the gods began to ac-
company the professor’s dumb show with whistling
variations on “ Home, Sweet Home.” It was a painfully
humorous exhibition whilst it lasted, but Mao. took his
ironical call with apparent complacency, and a few lady
admirers, who had tripped in specially to hear the
“ master” recite, seemed much gratified at his success.
In the London advertisement of “Cinder Ellen” vve
read; “The audience is politely requested to be seated at
eight o’clock, as the plot of the piece terminates at
quarter-past.”
The stalls of one Sydney theatre must have been built
for men with detachable wooden legs. A far-seeing and
bountiful Providence has blessed the average “colonial”
young man with a pair of lovely nether limbs. How the
doose can a chappie impress his girl when be sits beside
her like a trussed kangaroo and gazes at the show through
the chink between his knees?
The late Alfred Cellier left, by will, the “rights” of
“ The Mountebank ’ to Nellie Stewart.
Lucy Escott and Henry Squires, of the old Lyster
Opera Troupe, enjoy a happy old age in a villa on the
shores of the Mediterranean. The lady’s name is Lucy
E. Scott.
The Dick Lee-W. G. Grace letter brings to memory the
Squires episode of many years ago. Thu “silvery tenor”
had written to a friend in ’Frisco, speaking of the success
of the Opera Co. in Melbourne. He used the phrase—“ I
like this shore, but everything and everybody is blawsted
English.” The letter was published in the ’Frisco papers,
and found its way into the Melbourne journals. Lyster’s
troupe, then in Adelaide, S.A., were billed for a coining
season in Melbourne, opening with “ Martha.” The house
was crowded, and Squires' reception anything hut plea-
sant. The d.c. applauded to the echo, the other parts
howled, hissed and hooted. Farquharson, a great
favourite, came to the front, placed his hand upon Squires’
shoulder, and made a short explanation. The opera was
allowed to go on with occasional interruptions, but when
Squires sang “The Last Rose of Summer,” the house rose
at him, and he had no further need of an apologist.
Sara Bernhardt went bear-shooting when in the U.S.,
and killed two bears single-handed. They were old,
tame bears with most of the hair rubbed off them, and
they were bought from a local saloon-keeper tor the
occasion, no wild ones being available. Some of Sara’s
admirers led the dejected animals out into the woods and
chained them up, and then the divine tragedienne either
shot them or pounded them to death with the thick end
of her gun amid great rejoicings.
Zola’s new play, “ Therese Raquin,” is said to be a sort
of epileptic screech—a horror in four nightmares with a
moral. A woman, assisted by her lover, murders her
husband to clear the way for their marriage. The
woman’s paralysed mother-in-law haunts them ever after-
wards ; she knows the details of their crime, and only her
paralysis keeps her from denouncing them, but she
her baleful green eye upon them, like the starboard light
of a steamer, and ultimately that oppressive optic drives
them to suicide.
Musgrove and Williamson are on the best of terms,
evidenced by the former lending his scenic artist, Gordon
to J.O. W., to co-operate with Goatcher, in “ La Cigale.”
The Melbourne Knights of the Bucket - make the gruel
thick and slab—complain of a superfluity of flour and
water. In other words, managers have been cutting
down the bills this way and that way till the .esthetic
education of bill-boarding is all behind. Look at “ Evan-
geline”—a few miserable slips, while every hoarding
blossomed with the magnificent pictures when the two
Macs, were at their apex, zenith, and apogee.
Billee Barlow, sick, was out of the Melbourne “ Whit-
tington” cast six nights, but has re-appeared, whereupon
the first mention appears in the press of her being away.
Now, this is wrong, and indicates a fault in the critics,
perceptible in a variety of Melbourne cases recently. They
ought not to allow managers to dictate to them in
these matters, and here are other recent cases of the same
thing in Melbourne—no mention of substitution till the
principal re-appeared: Dauby, eight nights out of “Ruy
Bias ” ; Nellie Farren, about a week from the same piece ;
G. Rignold, as long from the “ Merry Wives.” So much
for your “ impartial press.”
Pattie Brown talks of going to England in April.
Irving’s “ Henry VIII.” is a tremendous affair. Pre-
liminary cost, £15,000, wherefore no profit can possibly be
handled, even with crowded houses, the first ten weeks.
Thereafter the ex.’s will go on, at £2OO a night, while the
packed house is £4OO. Ravenswood was a failure, and
Irving must be always tremulous over his immense
ventures, knowing how Bulwer’s posthumous “ Junius ”
ruined Wilson Barrett. Brough and Boucicault’s “Much
Ado ” won’t really begin to pay till Sydney sees it.
London Referee finds Horace Lingard’s production of
“ La Fauvette ” to be somewhat “ country tied and unso-
phisticated,” a cheap and roughly-finished article, in
fact. Also, the critic complains that there is too much
Horace Lingard, who “ takes the centre of the stage as if
it belonged to him as indeed it does in a manner of
speaking, for Mr. Lingard is ins own manager, and simply
does as he pleases.”
The past fortnight, writes our London correspondent
by last mail, lias made a record in primih'es : Haddon
Chambers’ “The Honourable Herbert,” at the Vaude-
ville ; Comyns Carr’s “Forgiveness,” at the St. .James';
Sydney Grundy’s “A Fool’s Paradise,” at the Garrick;
Gilbert and Cellier's “ The Mountebanks,” at the Lyric:
and “ Cinder Ellen," at the Gaiety. Add to these Irving’s
magnificent revival of “Henry VIII.,” the opening of
“ Venice in London," and Gus. Harris's big pantomime,
and you have an unparalleled list. “ A Fool’s Parad.se ”
is, of exiurse, not absolutely new, but it has never before
been properly staged and acted- It is drawing the town.
The annual ceremony of cutting the “ Baddeley Cake,”
writes our correspondent, was performed for the first time
/or many years somewhat in accordance with the old
actors’ intentions,, in the green-room of old Drury in the
presence of the company at present playing there.
Harris, however, not content with this, arranged a some-
what similar ceremony across the road at Covcnt Garden,
whither be had bidden the usual crowd of bang.ws oi:
Shortly after 11.80 the great man mounted a dais and
uncovered a huge cake which he proceeded to cut,
announcing that it was to lie known as “the Harris.”
Oouid caddishness go further?
The London critics agree, remarks our correspondent,
that Olga Nethersoie’s acting lias improved out of recog-
nition since she went to Australia. She played in “A
Pool’s Paradise” with great power, and contributed as
much as Hare himself towards tire undoubted success of
tjie play. Young Irving, in a thankless part, shows
improvement, and as he is ridding himself of his melo-
dramatic manner there is still some hope for the youth.
Young Hare lias already proved that the stage is his
metier: his career is assured.
“ Billy ” Florence was very near-sighted—couldn’t see
anyone in the auditorium, for which reason ho acted
better. Buokstone was so deaf that he had to watch the
mouths of the other performers.
The tiff between Moody and Sankey was because Sankey
took what is called a royalty on American organs, popu-
larised by ins playing.
Lawrence’s new “Life of G. V. Brooke ” is candid on
his feminine entanglements. He long travelled with
Madame Marie Duret, who came to Australia, but was
never here associated with him. When Brooke started
from London for Melbourne another lady was with him,
apparently not an actress, and recognised everywhere as
Mrs. Brooke, who kept house for him in Australia,
receiving all ins guests. Thus Miss Fanny Oathcart, a
strict young lady, could come to Australia as Mr.
Brooke’s pupil. When she arrived a very important
manager, who had buried two wives, fell in love with her,
but Boh Heir carried off the prize, and there was a bit of
a rumpus—soon healed.
Cates has a stage habit of twirling a “spirit”
moustache. This was very noticeable in “ Uncle and
Aunts,”
Carl Hertz, the illusionist, was “ honoured ” by the lat e
King of Bavaria with an elegant gold star that twinkle®
the name of “Hertz” in diamonds. This testimony to
genius is slightly discounted by the fact that His Majesty

Miss Adey Brunei, who is certainly a winsome and un-
conventional reciter, seems to be coming forth as a
teacher of elocution in Melbourne, to which end the fair
lady advertises a number of extravagant press_ notices
from “ home.” Some kind friend had better advise Miss
A. B. that English newspaper eniogium doesn't count for
much over here—nor over there, either. Besides, she has
already appeared at two Melbourne matinees and given
more proof of her ability than could be gathered from a.
mile of stereotyped praise by professional British
gushers.
Max O’Bell arrives in Sydney by the April Yankee
mail.
At Hobart, Wirth and Co. lately gave some open-air
cow-boy exhibitions at a sports ground. Of the two
audiences assembled—one inside and the other outside
the ground—the former was mainly composed of poor
people while the outsiders were a well-dressed lot.
lu view of the continuous envious sneers of a Sydney
daily paper (whose musical criLip is stated to have been
a competitor with M. Wiegand for the post of Sydney
city organist), it is interesting to notice that the London
Musical Times of Ist January refers to Mr. Wiegand as
“ the famous Belgian organist whose artistic and execu-
tive powers are so well known to Europe.’
The Gaiety Company have introduced J. F. Sheridan’s
“Little Glass” song into “Cinder Ellen” in London,
and the papers say’it is “ very pathetic.”
Meston has ail his myalls ready for collecting when pre-
pared to start on his American and European tour. He
will take 25 picked men and gins, including five of the
famous “Kalkadoonas,” one of whom is nearly 7ft. high.
His partner, B. H. Purcell, is bringing these in from the
M'Kinlay Ranges. Meston will take one of the finest
ethnological collections in Australia. He intends to give
special lectures before ail the scientific societies in the
countries visited, and will stay some time at the Chicago
Exposition.
Muzzy’s lieutenants, Melbourne Opera House, are
brother Harry, Frank Emery, and Lohr.
Marie Halton, Williamson’s new Cigaie, has struck a
grand blow for popularity. Williamson could hardly ask
La Cigaie to act for the unemployed, but she overheard
the talk, and came forward generously with the proffer.
What is becoming of the poor stage? People com-
plained of a clever woman singing an indifferent song, in
the Melbourne pantomime now running, and were told it
was an advertisement! In the burlesque at another
theatre there is a big whisky advertisement, in the prin-
cipal scene, but it was hoped the like of this had ever
been banished the harlequinade.
Williamson is now beginning to tickle his chin over
“ La Basoche.”
Organist Jude, despite adverse circumstances, did good
business in Tasmania, where his varied abilities were
greatly admired.
Harry Jewett meditates matrimony.
A London society paper declares that the Actors’ Asso-
ciation has done nothing to justify its existence, except
to take the subscription moneys of actors and actre-sts,
many of whom can ill spare the cash. It has never prose-
cuted bogus managers, nor moved in the matter of
insanitary dressing-rooms. It made a feeble splutter
against some agents, and is now anout to start a theatrical
paper. Sookanbuskin ! The actor is to be his own critic.
A ballet shame —women in tights.
Another story about deceased dramatist Wills. Like
other geniuses he had a strong distaste for clean linen,
and a friend meeting him one day said: “Dear hoy, I
had a terrible fright last night. Thought I saw a ghost,
and was in such a funk I turned as white as your shirt.”
Then he glanced at Wills’s dicky and added, “By Jove,
old man, I turned a good deal whiter than your shirt.”
George Anson will have several good stories to tell of
“ the colonies ” when he goes Home. One of his favourites
is about an excursion he and a party of merry mummers
took up the Nepean when he was last with the B. and B.
company in Sydney. The scenery was new to them, and
at each successive turn in the river the actors expressed
their admiration by such exclamations as, “ Bravo,
Gordon,” “ Well done, Spong,” “Good man, Brunton”
(scenic artists, you know). At last a specially fine view
came in sight, and a hitherto silent gentl man in the
stern gravely remarked, “Bravo, Mon Dieu!” Either
the man who said that was French, or he had borrowed
the remark from a Frenchman.
Miss Dwight, the well-known Melbourne Temperance
Hall pianiste, died last week.
A Brunswick (Melb.) shepherd held up his hands in
holy horror last week. He had assisted an unemployed
widow with a large family, and next day one of her little
boys told him—“ Oh, we had such a jolly time! Mother
took us to the Circus I” Moral : Never assist the Un-
employed.
“Bail Up,” the drama written for Mrs. Keightly to
immortalise her ride from Rockley to Bathurst, N.S.W.,
to obtain from her father 500 sovs. to rescue her husband,
the late 11. M. Keightly, from a bushranging gang, has
been produced at Bathurst, where the audience, knowing
the facts, found the author’s fiction very disappointing.
Morever, they didn’t quite like to see the lady making
capital out of an event which cost one man ids life and
very nearly cost the late husband his. In the play Ben.
Hall is depicted ns a blood-thirsty scoundrel, whereas he
never attempted to take life, and is supposed to have been
a rather mild-mannered sort of highwayman.

At Goonery, au out-statiou of Carney,

Five hundred of Melbourne’s unemployed
marched, without notice, into £cot.s Church, last
Sunday, and punctuated Rev. A. Marshall’s ser-
mon urging people to give honest working-men
either employment or bread with “hear, hears,
and loud applause, much to the horror of smug
and scented Toorakia, just back from the seaside.
The red flag—which means defiance, just
as the white flag means peace and the- black
piracy—has been hugely advertised in Melbourne
through good Pastor Bevan—salary A3O weekly—
having refused to speak under it, at the Sunday
unemployed meeting. The Pastor’s red hag is
his nice, soft, red velvet pulpit-cushion which he
hangs out every Sunday.
: The S.A. Surveyor-General has sent to
the museum an egg, depressed at one end, and
also oppressed with the photograph of a snake.
It is learnedly argued that the hen-mother was
terrified by a snake whose image she lithographed
maternally, after the fashion in which Jacob fooled
PTncle Laban in the matter of the ewes at water-
ing-time. Fancy and fable are not yet dead.
When Booth arrived in London, after his
tour of the world, the Salvationists hired 10
steamers, and crowded into them 4100 blatant
howlers armed with trombones* bassoons, cat
calls, hymns, saokbnts, bagpipes, and ail manner
of horrors. There was a big bill to pay for the
steamers and the whooping, but it all came out of
the money that the Australian believer gave for
the poor. We are going to yell for the Pope after
this. He seems the cheaper institution of the
two.
The Institute of Journalists, which hopes
to be “Australian,” compiled its constitution a
few nights ago in Melbourne. There are to be

Women “possessing tire necessary qualifications ”

Chief Justice Higinbotham has promised to be
president. Next general meeting on 27th.
Some Newcastle (N.S.W.) small tradesmen
have just been fined 255. each and costs under the
Towns Police Act (2 Vic. No. 2, sect. 10) for the
hideous offence of selling a glass of milk on Sun-
day. That a law which makes it a crime for an
honest man who has sixpence in his pocket to buy
a drink of milk and a bunch of grapes for himself
and his child, should be still extant, is surprising ;
that about 50 per cent of the clergy should support
it only shows what a set of cantankerous idiots
have forced their services on the almighty.
Another fact about Dick Lee. author of
the W. G. Grace lampoon. He arrived on Be ndigo
just as the Independent editor was looking round
to see a man, wherefore Dick went that very night
to report a political meeting, crowded and im-
portant, where Hattam, and a number of others,
held forth with a flood of loyalty. Dick was in a
floody state, but produced a large batch of copy.
Next day a shower of letters poured into the
office, but Dick was about as far as Castlemainc.
In short, every speaker complained he was
abominably misrepresented, and that the-report
was a stream of seditious lava. The editor
published one or.two letters, adding “We have
received other letters to the same tenor, and regret
that we have been deceived and imposed upon.’’
All very funny, no doubt, very droll and ex-
travagantly comic, to read about at this time of
day.
Melbourne telegrams state in a low tone
of voice that Superintendent Kennedy “does not
agree” with “ the finding of the board appointed
to inquire into the Edward Bell case.” Consider-
ing the language which that board used about
Kennedy this statement seems too probable to be
worth mentioning. We never yet knew any
accused individual who didn’t fail to agree when
the Judge made unpleasant remarks about him,
whether the remark was “ten years” or a five
shilling fine. Meanwhile Detective O’Donnell is
to be “ transferred.” What the board said about
him was practically that he obtained the convic-
tion of an innocent man, knowing him to be
innocent, and now he is to shift his peculiar
talent up to Stawell, where there probably are a
lot of innocent men badly in want of conviction.
Dear Bulletin, Your correspondent
“ Kyalite,” whose letter on the Riverine eel ques-
tion appears in your issue of to-day, is certainly
complimentary when he asks me to admit that I
don’t know a small eel from a leech. I have
asserted, and still assert, that on the occasion
mentioned in my previous letter I saw thousands
of small eels lying dead on the sandbanks of the
Edwards, and even the unique experience of
“ Kyalite,” who says he has fished that river as
man and boy for 30 years without seeing any eel.
either small or large, proves nothing in the way
of a direct negative. “ Kyalite ” simply says that
he has never seen or heard of eels being in the
Edwards, and I say positively that I have seen
thousands of small ones. These little eels were
exact facsimiles of large fresh-water eels, except
that they were of a delicate pink colour. If
“Kyalite” takes the trouble to make inquiries
among the townspeople of Deniliquin, who went
lobster-catching when the river became black on
the occasion to which I have referred, he will
doubtless find plenty of persons who can confirm
my statement. —H. 8., Sydney, Feb. 13, 1802.
P.'S.—l notice “Kyalite” says Ac caught leeches
in the Edwards. Is he sure they weren’t eels?
Dear Bulletin, —One of the games of the
land-monopolist (I include the big selector) In the
district of Narrabri West, N.S.W., is to fence in
the Government reserves, or, when they do ribt
fence them in, they graze their sheep and cattle
upon them, stealing the grass that belongs to the
public, and economising that in their own pad-
docks. Carriers find it difficult, and at times
impossible, to discover a decent feeding-camp for
their bullocks and horses, for the reserves arc
eaten bare by the usurping stock of the very men
for whom the carriers are expected to.take heavy
loads along ugly routes. Worse ; Carriers have
in places been charged agistment fees of 3d. per
night per head of stock for depasturing their
animals on Government reserves that have been
fenced in by the predatory squattah. Worst of
all; Carriers’ teams have actually been impounded
from the said reserves. Is this legal? A carrier
generally has no money to fool away in lawsuits,
so he puts up with those extortions. Besides, he
would bo boycotted from employment if he
resisted the encroachments of the men with whom
he makes carrying-contracts. Will so*io member
of Parliament bring this grievancp under the
notice of fbe Minister for Lands ? —Yours, Ac., D.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Reform or abolition of the Legislative
Councils. Which shall it be ?
Another revolution is impending in Brazil.
The monarchy has been felled, but its roots need
“grubbing.”
The next Victorian Parliament will
probably contain a large proportion of young
native Australians.
Duncan Gillies will stand again for his
present constituency (Eastern Suburbs) at next
Victorian elections.
Gladstone : “ Labour has, since 1884, a
majority of votes, and it rests with the voters to
prosecute and carry out just demands.”
Mr. Daniel b’Connor, we notice, is making
transparently artful speeches to the West Sydney
electors in the N.S.W. Legislative Council.
Sir Graham Berry graciously admitted to
a political deputation last week that he
“ hexpected to ’old horfice ” in a coming Govern-
ment.
Sixty members of Melbourne Stock Ex-
change petitioned the Mayor to convene a meet-
ing “for the purpose of calling upon Munro to
resign his self-inflicted .£3500 a year as Agent-
General.”
Sydney D.T. argues that the fiscal issue
cannot possibly be sunk by the bogus N.S.W.
“ National ” Asso.datum. And yet the D.T. lias
cursed the Labour-party in scores of leaders, for
not sinking it!
At the opening of the session of the
British Parliament last week, “everybody present
wore deep black in mourning for the late Duke of
Clarence.” How like an undertaker Henniker
Heaton must have looked !
Canada is ducking under to the US.
This week a conference is held between its
Ministers and Secretary Blaine rc the tariff. Even
Chancellor Capri vi has pointed out how the object
of the M'Kinley Tariff is to coerce Canada.
The Southern Press points out that on
Munro’s last trip to England, he got people to in-
vest in a bank which has failed. What sort of
inducement is this for his Agent-Goneralcy to
rehabilitate Victoria in British estimation?
The bogus “ National ” Association has
officially declared that its chief object is to defeat
any attempt to secure for one section of the com-
munity the power to dominate the remainder.
Therefore, ds chief objectis to commit suicide.
Little rubicund Outbrim, Minister for
Mines, (Vic.), says th it Munro is a good financier
and is being hounded down as Agent-General
because he is too honest in business. Query : Is a
“good financier” ever “too honest in business?”
A new terror is added to the sentences at
the Melbourne Criminal Sessions, the solemn
striking of convictees off the Electoral Roll, but
inasmuch as only about two-thirds of the people
on the rolls vote, it is to be feared this is a bit of
bogus.
That smellful politician, John Davies,
M.L.C., is now an out-and-out Tory. J. Davies
reminds us of the scotched snake which vainly
tries" to bite its own tail. With this difference —
that though Davies’ political backbone is fractured
he succeeds in biting his own tail.
The unmistakable Melbourne feeling is
chat either Berry should be sent back as Agent-
General, or M. H. Davies should have the office —
anything rather than bungling Munro. Davies
would really be the next best man to Berry—who
should be packed to England again instanter.
W. R. Campbell’s reason for desiring to
enfranchise the “copper” is artless and to the
point—“ They raise families and there is not a
more Conservative body in the country than the
police.” A Tory who multiplies his species ought
to be encouraged. By the way, almost every man
in a uniform is a Tory.
A meeting of Foreign-traders was held on
Thursday last week in Sydney Carington Hall to
protest against the Customs Duties Bill, The
Telegraph states that the hall was full; the
S.M. Herald mentions sadly that about 50 people
were present. Evidently one of them doesn’t
know the truth when it sees it.
There’s a political lightning-change artiste
in Melbourne. He went in the Liberal interest
against Hancock, for Collingwood ; then became
fugleman for the “National” Association, on
salary, as he admitted at a public meeting; and
now he’s Liberal again, going for Collingwood,
“ because the association wouldn’t agree to One-
man-one-vote.” Oh, g’long !
The Melbourne Associated Banks have
agreed to take up two-millions’-worth of Victorian
Treasury Bills, bearing per cent, at par. This
is only equal to gettbig the low price of £77
15s. fi|d. for per cents. And debentures are
short-dated bills. Victoria is paying dearly for
its whistle, since its ordinary 3J per cent, stock
was, on the date of the issue of Treasury Bills,
£91155.
Spagnoletti : “ Nothing can stop Berry
rushing to the head of affairs in Victoria. This is
t m irresistible and universal verdict on the
Collins-street flags. Nor is Berry’s style bad. He
makes headway, collaring the conservatives, all
fie Liberal Unionist sort of people, and impress-
ing Radicals with his excellent physique, trained
ability, and a studious avoidance of any offensive
Englishism. Besides, Shiels is a thing of naught
—Hybrid Liberal.”
The “ country party ” in the Victorian
Assembly have constructed their new “ platform,”
coiuprising eleven planks of an A.B.C. character,
with “additional recommendations.” Plank 3 is
“ In favor of immediate and vigorous measures
being taken to re-establish public confidence, and
to restore, the financial equilibrium.” Somehow
this reminds us of the suppositious politician who
declared himself a staunch advocate of increased
prosperity and better times.
“General” Booth says that “the pros-
perity of the Australian colonies is of mushroom
growth, and is of such a nature that it cannot
blend with religion.” Australia is a toadstool and
not an edible mushroom to Booth and exploiters of
his kind. Though he found many monopolists
enamoured of his cheap-slavery proposals, the
political power of the masses, who are self-pro-
tectively opposed to his “ submerged - tenth ”
scheme, was too great an obstacle for the self-
elected Pope of the Slums.
Sir Henry Parkes never forgave the late
Alex. Dodds, M.L.C., for the part he took
against him years ago in the East Maitland
election. Mr. Dodds nominated Frank Punch for
St. Leonards at the last contest. On the latter
AGIN THE GOVERNMENT.
OLD GENT (tending threepenny-bit to working man) : “Would you oblige me with three
tickets ? ”
WORKING-MAN : “Sorry, sir, on’y got two over my fare.”
OLD GENT : “ Let me have them. I would rather give the extra penny to you than
to the Protectionist Government.”
occasion Sir Henry, speaking at the hustings, on
the subject of an Elective Upper House, half
turned round, and looking at Mr. Dodds rudely,
said, “ When we get rid of these old gentlemen
who are anchored there. ” The departed Dodds
was not one of “ his creatures.”
Melbourne Argus is straining its loins to
bring about a second Service-Berry coalition, this
time with Service as Premier in the Upper House,
with guasi-neutral addenda in the persons of
“Sir” Henry Wrixon, J. G. Duffy, M‘Lean, &c.
An “impossible” scheme. Service would want to
be Treasurer, and the Assembly wouldn’t stand
an M.L.C. in that niche, besides which, such a
location of the Treasury portfolio would be
distinctly unconstitutional and anti-democratic.
Further, Service is now old and feeble —over
seventy, and loves to be coddled by his women
folk.
The attempt of Trickett, M.L.C. (N.S.W.),
to deprive of the franchise all police and military
servants, stipendiary magistrates, clerks of petty
sessions, &c., cannot be justified by any reason-
able logic. If Trickett were logical, lie would
aspire to higher flights and disqualify all judges
and even legislators—aye, and the most potent
army of bailiffs and the common hangman. Free-
dom would indeed shriek at any such a travestied
injustice. Speaking soberly, manhood suffrage is
neither more nor less than what the common
interpretation of the words mean. Constables are
men, therefore they are entitled to vote. They
may have official as well as private consciences,
but the ballot only recognises their right as men.
Whether the constable polls his official or bis
private conscience is not a wrinkle on the political
welkin.
David Christie Murray, speaking recently
at a Colonial Institute meeting, struck a great
patch of truth as under :
I lamented, and I still lament the fact —and I expressed
it openly as one of the causes of Australian dissatisfaction
with England, that we send to these splendid colonies
our most dangerous incapables. I denounce that as a
hitter injustice to the colonies. I met there 20 or 80
hopeless blackguards whom I had known over here
[What a lot of blackguards Christie knows !—“ tell me
your company,” &c.— Ed. B.] - Scotchmen and English-
men sent out by their parents simply because they were
wastrels.
The tiling Murray forgot to mention is that Eng-
land, on top of her other outrages, wan|s to know
why Australia isn’t grateful for this collection of
waste matter. When the Englishman starts out on
a philanthropic mission he always has one idea—
to send the poor, the crippled, the imbecile,
drunken, diseased and incurably vicious to some
other country, and leave them there. And then,
having thrown his dead dog over the wall into the
next man’s garden, and hit the owner of the
garden in the eye with the offensive matter, he is
quite surprised that the recipient of the beastly
thing doesn’t sing a hymn of praise and thanks-
giving.
The Foreign-traders of Sydney are hiring
canvassers to obtain signatures to a petition
praying the House of Aged Fossils to reject the
Customs Duties Bill and thus set up its feeble
old bones as a barrier against the expressed reso-
lution of the nation. Every house in Sydney is
to be visited, and in the gentle language of the
Telegraph, “ women as well as men shall have
an opportunity of recording their protest against
the new tariff.” They shall—in fact, most of the
signatures will be those of women. The average
woman never reads a petition, and will sign
almost anything, and she will depend entirely on
the explanations of the canvasser, who will tell
her that kid gloves are fivepence a pair dearer
through the duty. And then, in a very short
while, the Telegraph will speak about this docu-
ment as the emphatic protest of the great mass of
the “ electors of Sydney,” and will entirely forget
the fact that only one-sixth of the signatures were
electors and the rest were women, children, and
assorted infants.
Premier Griffith, of Queensland, has issued
a manifesto announcing his conversion to the
cause of nigger-labour, and the re-opening of the
kanaka slave traffic. Griffith rose to power first
on the cry of Australia for the white Australians.
He groaned for years and years about the suffer-
ings of the coloured serf on the northern planta-
tions ; he even shed a tear over him, and there
used to be a lump in his throat and crape on his
voice when lie talked about the burdened nigger.
His Government hounded the “Hopeful” prisoners
to a living death as a burnt-offering on the altar
of the ill-used Polynesian, and relentles.-h pi.- *ed
a miserably shady case against Sorenson, and con.
victed him on evidence that was too unspeakably
thin and suspicious to hold good against a dog-
all as a proof that they were solid on the white-
labour question. It was the only political prin.
ciple Griffith ever had —if he ever really
had it and now that it is gone he has
no political principle at all. In his new
capacity as an advocate of black-labour he is much
more eloquent than he ever was as an advocate for
white-labour. Whether he has a genuine belief
in either policy is doubtful —in fact, it is doubtful
if Griffith has a genuine belief or any other kind
of a belief in anything. But at present he holds
a brief for the big sugar-planter, and the labour-
trader, and the fatted syndicate, and he sheds the
same old tear over them as he used to shed over
the miserable Kanaka who was kidnapped from his
South Sea home under the nose of a drunken
“ Government agent,” sent out to see fair play on
board a “ blackbirding ” labour schooner. Griffith
has only one tear, and it is a glass imitation article
which he has used over and over again all through
his career. When he brings it out and fastens it
on his open countenance, everybody knows that
there is pathos coming, and that Sir Samuel has a
big brief in his pocket.
An obliging Bananalander in a far-out
township sends us five sides of news. Essence;
Two drunken local undertakers, performing the
last rites over a deceased publican, got the grave
made too small, and to make things level sawed
off half of the deceased boniface’s legs : likewise
the local doctor has a three-years’grog-prohibition
order out against him : the only sober local under-
taker is a Chinaman, the postmaster is mad, the
storekeeper and saddler are always in the horrors
and (ghastly climax !) the blacksmith is a Scotch-
man. Thanks.
“Any man who has not sufficient fore-
sight to provide for the future is an incubus
upon the State, and should be allowed to die,”
says politician - lawyer Crick, as reported in
Sydney Evening News. Good. Nearly all our
really brightest men die in the gutter, absolutely
or comparatively. Our country has not produced
many men who have said or written anything
worth remembering, but some of our geniuses,
such as they were, left not even a pair of socks’
and some were buried amongst murderers, and
some shot themselves because of over-Jew bills.
None of them provided for the future. It is the
dogs and wolves chiefly who perform this func-
tion. These snatch and bnry a bone, often with
the life-blood of the community scarcely dry upon
it—then they get an “ extra vote for thrift ” from
the “National” Association —they dig up their
plant by night and it provides for their future,
even when it reeks with corruption. Let us howl
a panegyric for these provident hoarders of bones.
THE NATIONAL ASS.’S NEW PLATFORM.
One vote for Manhood and one vote for Thrift,
None to the wretch who is poor and adrift,
One for the toiler hard striving to live,
Two for the lucky rich loafer they’d give,
For Thrift in the sight of the National Ass.
Is proved in the sacred possession of “brass ;”
Possession by chance, or by striving alway
To grab what you can and give little away ;
To screw, and to pinch, and to chisel your neighbour,
To feed a tat purse by the starving of labour.
Ye gods! we know thousands who work on this plan,
who'd
Win votes for their Thrift by the loss of their Manhood,
Rescued from Misery.
John L. Aubrey, Esq., Sofala, N.S.W., kindly
furnishes the following testimony “In January,
1879 I was master of a provisional school in tho
western district, and I married a delicate young
lady, and was shortly afterwards appointed
teacher under the Board of Education. Our first
child was born in September 18S0, after which my
wife never seemed to regain her usual strength.
In May, 1881, she was suddenly taken very ill;
the family doctor was sent for and was greatly
puzzled ; he, however, prescribed and the patient
Partly recovered. About twelve months later
she was very much troubled with a painful
throbbing movement in the abdomen, especially
when lying down, loss of appetite, and what food
was taken afforded no nourishment. Another
doctor was called in, who sounded and prescribed,
but to no purpose. We left the neighbourhood
and went to Lithgow Valley, hoping to effect an
improvement, but without result. Another doctor
did all he could and decided that the case was one
of enlargement of the liver, and this proved to be
the case, as the side sometimes swelled so large as
to prevent dressing; so matters progressed and
got from bad to worse. Numerous doctors con-
tinued to do but little good and that only
temporary, but all agreed that the svstem was
generally weak and wanted building up; and the
liver would sometimes swell and burst off button
after button off her ulster while standing in a store.
For the last two years the trouble has been com-
plicated with a most distressing rushing noise in
the head, so violent as to render it impossible to
lie in bed at night, with violent attacks of windy
colic, causing complete prostration, and excoria-
tion of the throat. Eventually, after further
sufferings, I read of Clements Tonic and its
wonderful effects, and sent for a bottle. The
first dose was too strong for the debilitated
stomach. I diluted it with water and gradually
increased it as the stomach could bear it. Mrs.
Aubrey has now taken three bottles and the effect
is mo.t marvellous; the swelling has entirely
disappeared, and the waist is reduced by seven
inches. The eyesight is renewed and strengthened,
the appetite returned, the noise in the head
diminished, and, to use ray wife’s own words,
‘Language utterly fails to describe the relief and
benefit she has experienced by the use of only
three bottles of Clements Tonic.’ 1 consider
Clements Tonic the most palatable and effective
medicine I have ever used in cither England,
India, Africa, or Australia.— John E. Aubrey.”

The latest story about a certain eccentric
Australian police magistrate. His liver was ex-

usual, he got worse. He said: “Clear that

of those lazy loafers. I don’t believe there are
faces as ugly as some of those in hell! ” .
The cherubic-looking editor of a Mel-
bourne paper is a dude, and a frugal dude at that.
He used to get his clothes made “at Home” and
consigned to a Sydney friend, so saving the duty.
The last consignment to hand, however, arrived
at Sydney just after the new tariff came into
force, and just now there is a Melbourne editor
walking round with stylish but frayed pants,
praying for a speedy triumph of Cornstalk Free-
trade.
An evidently irate correspondent inforn s
The Bulletin "that Francis and Lalor “did not
despise a knighthood,” and that “Higinbotham,
if ever offered it, refused it because he didn’t think
that an handle would be an ornament to his
plebeian name.” Our correspondent carefully
avoids giving his own name, which is probably
Hogchops. A name doesn’t make a man an aris-
tocrat, but the man may make his name noble.
Higinbotham has done that.
The name of the Earl of Ranfurly, a

Dr. Ulrich Hiibbe, who recently died in
Adelaide, was the draftsman of R. R. Torrens’
famous Real Property Act. Hiibbe got the
idea in Germany, and nearly the whole measure
was the work of his brain. He brought from the
Fatherland the idea that mortgages should not
change the freehold, but should be charges in
priority. The Doctor always thought himself
badly treated by his adopted country, and very
justly he considered his services should have been
amply rewarded.
It is related of Mr. Jenks, late Law Pro-
fessor at Melbourne University (who has just left
for England), when he got married a year or two
ago, that on the day the vessel bearing his “ to
be ” arrived in port, he went to the University in
the morning and conducted a class ; at mid-day
he hastened to the pier, brought away from the
vessel his bride, escorted her to a church and
married her, then returned to the University again
and delivered a profound lecture upon Jurispru-
dence. How’s that for a day’s work ?
The late Dr. Perry, once Bishop of Mel-
bourne, loft behind him £31,000. Cardinal
Manning died worth only £lOO, but in fairness to
Perry it should be remembered that married
clergymen of Protestant churches have widows
and families to provide for, whereas the Roman
priests are celibate. However, no clergyman who
would do justice to the Christian religion can
afford to die worth more than his books and fur-
niture and a life-assurance for the benefit of his
immediate heirs.
Fraser Smith, the Hongkong editor—he
was in Sydney a few months ago —has practically
been ruined by the little Crown-colony clique,
against whose aggression he has fought so long
and so manfully, and his friends are raising a
fund to free him from money trouble. The “ set”
made against him reminds one of the experiences
of Edward Smith Hall and other men who, in
early Australia, fought; for public right as against
Imperial official privilege. Through official
machinations Fraser Smith was denied the use of
every local hall, and had to hold an open-air
meeting.
At an Otago election meeting John Lar
nach was asked his opinion of Fergus, his (Lar
nach’s) successor as Minister of Mines. The chair-
man objected to the question as improper. “ I
have no objection to it,” suavely put in Larnach ;
“I consider Mr. Fergus a very handsome gentle-
man with a very large beard.” Another story of
Larnach : Editor Twopenny, of Otago Daily
Times, known throughout Alaoriland as a breeder
of dogs, threatened to oppose Larnach for the
Peninsula seat. At a meeting the sitting member
referred to his opponent thus: “The gentleman
calls himself a leader of public opinion. Well, all
I have ever known him to lead is a fox-terrier
stallion round this district, for pecuniary pur-
poses. ”
The German princes of Pless, one of
whom has just wedded Miss Cornwallis West, are
a curious lot. They are all named John Henry,
and they are all numbered after the fashion of
monarchs, or convicts, or registered dogs, or stud
bulls; and as the numbers take in not only the
direct line of princes but all their cousins and
second cousins, and their twenty-third nephews,
and their one-hundred-and-seventy-ninth uncles,
it has come to pass at last that nearly all the in-
habitants in their locality are John Henrys with
a number. When the numbers go up to a certain
point—a hundred or so—they start afresh ;by the
time it reaches John Henry lxxxxix the thing is
pretty monotonous, and the people want some
variety. (N.B.—This paragraph is written by
Thomas lxiii.)
Many prominent Maoriland barristers are
self-made men, sprung direct from the plebs.
Clever Theo. Cooper, possessor of the finest prac-
tice, sold newspapers in the streets of Auckland,
and afterwards graduated in the machine-room of
an Auckland morning paper; so also did his
brothers “Ted” and William, both successful
forensically. W. J. Napier, who, single-handed,
beat M'Arthur and Co. in the great Samoan land-
case, is the son of a shoeblack, and fifteen years
ago was a boy in a tobacconist’s shop. Hon. Joe
Tole, an ex-Minister of Justice, the son of a com-
mon soldier (named O’Toole), and Thomas Catter
are sons of the proletariat now enjoying big
practices at the Bar. Sir Robert Stout himself is
entirely self-taught, and is the son of a very
“ small ” Shetland Island shopkeeper.
A n escapade of Richard Egan Lee, author
of the now celebrated “W. G. Grace letter.” We
change the names, that is all—he himself told the
story to the present writer. He arrived at Cow-
town just exactly in the nick of time —said the
proprietor of the local Observer. This potentate
had been slangwhanged by a woman, call her
Mrs. Bullfinch, who edited the local paper in a
neighbouring town. “Give it her hot,’’said he,
and we will call him Sugars. So, Dick “did her
up ” in one of his choicest W. G. Grace styles,
beginning, “ When a female baboon squats in a
gutter, and slings mud at respectable journalists,
it is time to protest.” This duly appeared, say,
on Thursday. On Saturday, after receiving his
wages, Dick, eating pears in the orchard at the
back of the newspaper printing-office, heard
a terrific din, as if everything was being smashed
in the place. He rightly divined that it was Mrs.
Bullfinch’s two brothers chasing Sugars round
with sticks, and so he scooted right off out of the
town.
The father of a certain brilliant, but now
departed, N.S.W. barrister, was a worthy old
Northern dairyman, who sacrificed much to
obtain for his son a liberal education and went
wild with delight when young got his first
brief from a friendly solicitor. The old man
attended to witness his son’s first appearance in
horsehair, and invited a number of his friends and
as many of the unoccupied jurymen as he could
find to join him in celebrating the occasion.
After had made one of those impassioned
appeals to the twelve which the young Irish-
Australian so greatly affects, the jury retired, and
his father hastened down to G ’s Hotel, close
to the Court-house, to tell his friends all about it.
“ Gintlemin,” said the old man, “’twas the
proudest moment of me life, and I’m well repaid
for all me expinses an Janny’s edjucation. For
what did I see in the Coort above? There was
the Joodge wrangling wid the barristhers, and the
barristhers wrangling wid the lawyers, and, by
G , gintlemin, there was my Janny wrangling
wid the whole lot o’ them.”
The citizens of Glasgow, it is cabled, are
promoting subscriptions for the persecuted
Russian Jews. An Irish blaggard here remarks
that “ a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind.”
When the N.S.W. Harbors and Rivers
Department called for tenders for 60 tracings of
machinery for the new Defence Dept., the tenders
ranged from £2B to £l5O, and most of tht
tenderers were not draftsmen at all, but clerks,
artisans, &c. Nearly all the draftsmen and archi-
tects who arrived recently from Melbourne and
Maoriland, are returning owing to the dearth of
work.
Resolution passed by the Pahiatua (M.L.)
county council:—
The public, whenever each or any one of them And a
short cut from anywhere to anywhere else, are to immedi-
ately publicly notify it for the benefit of anyand all those
whom it may concern, and that a copy of this resolution
be forwarded to the Makuri township.
The Bulletin rises to express its utter
disbelief in the existence of any “Dora Dora
blacks.” It is tired of reading in the daily papers
the recital of the fabulous achievements of
“ Sarjint O’Smiley, capably assisted by Saynyer
Constable O’Blatherty and Constable Bannigan,”
who “thracked ” the desperadoes amid the glow-
ing haze of a tropical day, and the murky
mysteries of an insect-governed night, for lofij
Irish miles, and who, at the very moment when
men and horses fell into dead faints on a clump of
prickly-pears, could just see the two niggers
sitting straddle-legged on the edge of the horizon.
Assorting and analysing all the alleged circum-
stances connected with thehistory of these mythical
outlaws, The Bulletin asserts its suspicion that
they were deliberately invented in order to pro-
vide pleasant picnics and extra-duty allowances
for mouldering policemen. It refuses to believe
that there are any Dora Dora blacks whatever,
and, if the allegations concerning them contain
any grain of truth, it will probably eventually be
discovered that they are policemen in disguise,
who have taken to the road, and are secretly
supplied with provisions by their comrades in the
force. And in further support of this theory it
may be pointed out that nobody has actually seen
any blacks from the very beginning of the scare
until now, and the only time that any man
thought he saw one and fired at him he shot a
respectable settler in the abdomen, and, so far as
.any evidence went, there wasn’t a real Dora Dora
black within a hundred miles.
Dr. Fletcher’s Pills.
£50 FOR CIRCULARS.
We 'isg to notify that we have bought back
the circulars sent out with Dr. Fletcher’s Pills
during 1891. The whisky bottle contained 2128
pills, and we bought the forms from the following
gentlemen at the following prices :
A. Bauer’s, Kilkivan, Queensland, for ,£25.
J, M. Frazer’s, Hardinge-st., Auck., N.Z., £lO.
G. Paroipien’s, 709 Toorak-rd., Melb., £5.
W. H. Pudderphat’s, East Wodonga, Vic., £4.
G. Russell’s, Market-st., Adelaide, £3.
J. Marshall’s, Strath Hagley, Tasmania, £2.
E. W. Griffin’s, Avonside, Oh’tchurch, N.Z., £1
’ For New Year, 1893, we have filled a large
Clements Tonic bottle with Ur. Fletcher’s Pills,
and we enclose a circular with every shilling box
of them, on which our friends are requested to
write a number, and we agree to buy back the
circular for £25 for the first one to hand which
bears the written number corresponding nearest
to the number of pills in the bottle ; £lO for the
second ; £5 for the third ; and £4, £3, £2 and £1
for the 4th, sth, 6th, and 7th, respectively. The
pills will be counted Dec. 24th, 1892, and all
circulars must be in our office before that date or
we refuse to buy them. We buy back the first
nearest seven, only. Dr. Fletcher’s Pills are a
quick, sure and positive cure for indigestion,
constipation, headache, liver and kidney com-
plaints, and are used with greater success and
more extensively by male and female sufferers
than any other medicine, and we have thousands
of testimonials to prove this. They are sold by
all chemists, storekeepers, and patent medicine
dealers everywhere, or post free for 13 penny (not
2d.) stamps of any colony, from F. M. Clements,
Newtown, Sydney.

LIFE OF C. SB. PARNELL,

Price (post jree), Is. 2d.
“Mr. O’Connor has certainly surpassed himself in the
writing of this intensely interesting work. ... No
newspaper notice, however full, can give any adequate
impression of the career as is here depicted of the great
Irishman who has gone. Mr. O’Connor’s book itself should
be in the hands of everyone who is interested in the
brilliant and stormy career which is ended for ever. . .
A delightful, graphic and biographical sketch of one of
(lie most remarkable figures of the century.”—Dublin

Two absolute essentials for the existence
of the human race are—land and air. Many
economic and political systems have been invented
and are advocated for obtaining land for each
individual to live upon, but it has been left to the
Hydraulic Cooling and Ventilating Co. to intro-
duce pure air into every habitation in Australia,
by means of their “Perfection” Cooler and
Ventilator. By attaching this machine to your
water supply or tank, and simply turning on the
tap, a constant stream of pure, fresh air can be
obtained in any chamber you desire. Punkahs
are thus superseded, perishable goods can be kept
at a small expense without ice, and you can enjoy
the luxury of a cool chamber on the hottest day or
night. The machine, which is simplicity itself,
works at the cost of one half-penny per day, while
the price brings it within the reach of most.
Send for particulars or inspect the machines work-
ing in our offices. T. A. Knight and Co., St.
James Chambers, King-street, Sydney
Society
A big Sydney bank, which holds the bulk
of the securities taken by Mr. Abraham Friedman,
the busted money-lender, from his “clients,” has
commenced legal proceedings in a wholesale fashion
against Friedman’s debtors. As it is well-known
that politicians formed a considerable portion of
Friedman’s clientele, it is more than probable that
Abraham’s collapse will cause some M.P.’s who
did business with him to face their constituents
ere long.

Dailey once prophesied that Parkes would
yet rule over “a nation of creditors.” If the
Dibbs Government follow their present track,
they will yet reign over a nation of inspectors.
The latest inspector is Captain Le Patourel, late
of the N.S.W. Artillery, who is to “inspect the
N.S.W. rifle ranges” in return for “ .£2OO a year
and travelling allowances.” When we become
old and hoary, may Heaven send us as soft an
official bed whereon to lay our aching bones !

Pastor Soltau, of Tasmania, who claims
that it was he who fetched along the Launceston
earthquake by prayer as a punishment for the
local sinners, will presently have reason to wish
he had never been born. A Melbourne syndicate
owning property on the island has served him with
a writ for .£250,000 damages for shook, malicious
concussion, and wilful destruction to their pro-
perty. We can hear with the capacious ear of
prophecy the Pastor under examination in the
witness-box. “ Did you not state that you fetched
along that earthquake by prayer.” “I did.”
“ You are aware, no doubt, that one old woman
died of fright; do you admit murdering that old
woman?’ “I—ahem—that is a matter which
rests entirely with the Lord. I am only a

much damage was done to property. Do you
admit causing that damage?” “I—ahem —I

“ Are you willing to pay up the damage? ” “No.”
“ Then you don’t admit that you caused the
injuries and killed the old woman?” “No.”
“ Then you didn’t bring about the earthquake ? ”
“No, I didn’t.” “Then when you said you
caused it by prayer the statement wasn’t true ? ”
“No.” “ What do you call a man who makes a

Madame Carandini was “farewelled” in a
very neat and kindly way at Allan’s, the afternoon
previous to the veteran nightingale’s final de-
parture from Melbourne. A little group of men
who knew her when she was from 20 to 40 years
younger handed over (per Mr. Fred Tate) a purse
containing 130 sovereigns, and anon the secretary
of Madame’s concert at the Town Hall came
forward with a cheque for ,£2OO, under the weight
of all which tangible expression of good-will the
lady fairly broke down. It is not often that the
musical world of Melbourne comes out so freely
with its money, but, then, in this instance the
good cause happened to be an especially handsome
and charming woman.

A late “popular” Australian Governor,
who used to be hand-in-glove with everybody
who could cheer him, was ineffably stingy in his
own establishment. “ Meat once a day,” was his
healthy, economical rule as regarded his menials.
At the expiration of his term, not One of his ser-
vants would return to Hingland with him ; he
never shook hands, nor even bleated a fatherly
farewell to any of his commoner old retainers, and
as to the disbursement of parting remembrances—
no fear.

If the Earl of Glasgow had a mania for
the turf, like his crotchetty old predecessor in the
title (who bred Musket’s sire), one could under-
stand him being sent out to bid for the sporting
vote and interest of Maoriland. The incoming
Gov., however, is alleged to be a dreary nonentity
and a pious infliction of the most respectable
character. He hates racing, and is altogether a
dry-hash individual in his 00th year. Evidently
Knutsford considers that anything will do for the
beastly Kawlinies (especially Maoriland) nowa-
days, provided that it carries a Scotch title.
Kintore, Hopetoun, Hamilton, Glasgow! The
Duke of Edinburgh will soon be forwarded as
King of Australasia if we don’t take care.

A Melbourne suburban Mayor—a butcher
generously announced that on a certain night
he would distribute free meat to the unemployed.
He did so—gave away at least a ton. Yery
philanthropic-looking, but—he had appropriated
part of his mayoral banquet-allowance to provide
the meat. Having supplied that article himself
he did a good stroke of business, beside posing as
a public benefactor and helping along his parlia-
mentary candidature. That, and the fact that, as
the allowance came from the ratepayers, the
starving men probably paid for the meat them-
selves after all, is one .aspect of the case. The
other is that, had the Mayor been like aldermen
in general, he would have spent the money in
greasing the fat pigs at the Town Hall.

One of the most skilful Melbourne inter-
viewers has just come off best in a bout with a
slippery politician. This individual played the
bplly, and wanted to make out that he had been
misreported. In this case the editor, contrary
to the usual practice, stuck to his reporter, and
the M.L. A. was routed. Yet he has hectored
other papers into grilling their interviewers. The
old Tory newspaper proprietors have a most
absurd theory that an interviewer must shorthand
it. Experience tells you that a man will never
talk under such circumstances, unless he be a
self-seeking sixth-rate prig—who’ll write his own
interview,

A correspondent from China writes in a
Melbourne daily last week, that the missionaries
live there like fighting cocks. In a river steamer,
he travelled with nuns, who wouldn’t look at him,
but each put away at dinner a couple of glasses of
sherry and half a tumbler of claret; nor are the
Protestant missionaries behind in luxurious living.
OUT OF THE QUESTION.
YOUNG MASHER (proceeding to tell old swell a story) : “ The other night a girl who’s a

OLD SWELL ( impressively) : “ My dear young man, no girl who is a friend of your’s
can possibly be a friend of your wife.”
In a gidya clump, about four chains from
the beaten track, six miles from Widgcegoara
bead-station, off the main road to Cunnamulla
(Q.), the traveller will, a correspondent tells us,
come upon a heap of white bones, an old billy-can,
a pannikin, a perished waterbag, heavy hobnailed
blucher boots, rotted shreds of clothing, swag-
straps, &c. —a collection of things eloquent of the
hard death of one out of many hundreds who
perish by thirst in the Australian bush. These
bones belong to one who so died in the drought of
’BB-9. An enquiry was duly held and orders were
issued for burial. But the dingoes sharpened
their teeth on the bones, the crows feasted on the
snn-carrioned flesh, and the remnants bleach
openly, a testimony to official laisser faire. It is
wondered if burial vouchers ever passed through
the departments on this count.

Solicitor Trickett, of Sydney, confesses
once to have been in a tight place. He had drawn
the will of old Mrs. Fox, who owned a city pro-
perty in King-street, adjoining the Daily Tele-
graph office. On the old lady’s death he
assembled the people interested or alleged to be
interested in the old lady’s affairs and read the
will. Amongst the expectant legatees was an old
woman who had daily waited upon the deceased
“just to take a drop o’ tay or sich like.” This
lady was an expectant to the extent at least of
half the property, but item after item was read
and yet her name did not appear. Mr. Trickett
finished reading, and the old lady’s wrath knew
no bounds. She cursed the dead, and, had the
“casket” been at hand, she declared she would
have opened it and “ spat ” upon the corpse. She
seemed to think the lawyer her mortal enemy, and
had he not departed, would have “gone for him.”
Mrs. Fox left most of her money to “St. Mary’s.”

A story (told by a Queensland paper,

found among the debris. The A.D.C. thought it
belonged to a certain Miss Smith, and wrote to
her about it, signing himself, “ Yours, Binning.
after the accustomed style of the British lord.
The answer he received paralysed him so much
that his eye-glass got fixed in his eye for 40 days,
and had to be removed at last by a surgeon. It
read : “ Dear Binning,—The fan doesn’t belong to
me.—Yours, Smith.”

At Bridgend (Eng.), the other day, Judge

judgment in the railway-station at the end of the
journey. We don’t do things that way in Aus-

The mau who makes a pile by his own
efforts has to be dreadfully mean to do it and his
eff nness sticks to him for ever afterwards. Any
"nt who happens to drop into a George-street
(Svdney) restaurant, and watch a certain enonn-
mislv rich man who lunches there every day, will
presently realise this. It is an eighteenpenny
P Sshment, and he goes there partly as a
e r ifice to appearances, and partly because he
sao ” h the Premises ; but he would much rather
patronise the sixpenny place down at the Chinese
Therefore he tries to get level by eating
thing on the table, and there is a grieved
expression^ on his countenance when he has to go
way and leave something behind him. He con-
fines all the sauce in the bottle, and all the green
Sin the dish, regularly. He empties the little
teapot that is brought to him, and then he shakes
it and then he takes off the lid and looks in to
make quite sure that no fluid is left concealed
among the leaves. He uses all the sugar in the
basin and demolishes the butter, and generally
he gets right through the bread. Then he takes
‘the milk-jug, glares into it with one eye, and
solemnly drinks up the contents. But the thing
that obviously preys on his mind is the cruet. He
~a n’ t eat all the mustard, yet it rends his vitals to
leave it behind, and he regards it with a wistful
expression which seems to imply that his great
soul is struggling with a sense of defeat. Cast ot
all he gathers up his ticket, heaves a heart-broken
sigh, and goes away.

It has been noted that the most violent
advocates of total abstinence in N.S. Wales are
hopeless slaves of their nipes. Similarly, the chief
leader of the liquorphobia movement in Brisbane,
“ Blue Ribbon ” Clark, is a bondsman to nicotine.
He has “ sworn off ” smoking several times to the
writer’s knowledge, hurled away his pipe with a
pious anathema and a good resolution, given away
his tobacco and pouch, and —been seen strutting
down Queen-street next day with a seven-inch
cigar in his mouth. Sydney’s own Niman Mel-
ville, too, is afflicted with smokomania and is
understood to go to bed with his pipe in his
mouth. Were it not against the rules_ of the
House, he’d often smoke out the Committee of
the Whole when hon. members are stonewalling.
So it is with most of the chief anti-alcoholic
bigots. Smoking is their darling sin. But it is
not their only darling sin, mind you.

Some years ago a young and exceedingly
rich Australian lawyer got badly smitten by a
beautiful actress. He constantly attended the
theatre where she appeared, and thus became
mixed up with theatrical people generally. Ihe
young actress left the stage and married -not the
lawyer, but quite another fellow, and the lawyer
now practically “bosses” the theatre where his
idol used to play. There is a big moral in this.

Broken is the golden bowl. The new

ferred,” and said, “if they followed him to the
nearest puli, he would do the needful. Ihe press
noticed the pointed way in which it was ignored,
and remained glued to its seat. 1 hen a resolu-
tion was unanimously passed to adjourn to the

Upon the corpse of W. G. Long, a recently

by an unknown person and witnessed by Long—
“ J limit myself to one bottle of beer each day,
and that such shall be brought to me, so that I
shall not be in any way required to enter a hotel.”

The whereabouts of Speight, Chief Com-

mystery of these latter days. Two Saturdays ago
that inspired failure went up-country, or down the
bay, or somewhere, and during an awful period of
suspense a great multitude of Victorian engines
were allowed to go puffing to and fro like sheep
without a shepherd. The Chief Commissioner, in
short, was lost to everything save his salary, which
stuck to him as usual. He left no postal address
for the benefit of the reporters, and no sort of clue
that could be followed up by the black-trackers
with any hope of success. An unaccountable
absence of Speight at such a dull time is not to be
borne in silence. He is the mainspring of political
oratory in Victoria, so to speak, and the sole sup-
port of Melbourne’s alleged “ comic” paper. Take
Speight out of public life and the Cabbage Garden
becomes a mere wilderness with nothing but a bad
smell to fall back upon. Under the circumstances

“ Our paths diverge.” Six years have fled
Since first you spoke those words and turned
To leave the rival whom you spurned,
“ She loves you not,” you, sneering, said,
“Our paths diverge.”
Six years ago the world was fair,
An English landscape bathed in light
And summer beauty ; all more bright
For she, adored by both, was there
Six years ago.
Alas, too late, my love found voice,
You’d won her heart (she said) and hand,
And I, I left my native land, . „
Where Love had whispered once Rejoice,
Alas, too late.
I’ll take your hand ; I never thought
To see you dying in the south,
To see the blood-foam on your mouth—
Despite the agony you’ve wrought,
I'll take your hand.
I never thought that she could die,
That you would wander o’er my path ;
I’ve ne’er recalled you save in wrath,
Of her, except with longing, I
I never thought.
You’d speak again ? Your hand grows cold ;
The Morn is flushing all the grey ;
I scarce can hear what you would say ,
You smile, but not as once of old ;
You’d speak again ?
“ Our paths diverge.” Dear friend, ah no! >
Strength comes with Day. . . . My God, he s dead .
They two have met, and I must tread
A lonely world —-as long ago,
Our paths diverge 1
THE PHOENIX
TO THE GODDESS OE TRUTH.
Tell us, goddess, pure, undraped,
You who know our frail ways,
Whereunto had Speight escaped
When he fled the railways ?
Leave us not in fear and doubt ;
Say—what was the man about?
Was he roaming far and wide,
Or in calm seclusion.
With refreshment at his side,
Free from all intrusion ?
Was he romping in the hay.
Spite of lines that never pay ?
Was he picnicking with Zox,
Likewise Duncan Gillies,
Camping out in baokest blocks,
Boiling tea in billies?
Was it on a rural burst
That he started, Feb. the first?
Ne’er a farewell word he spake
Telling of his movements,
P’raps he went to test a brake,
One with new improvements ?
Was it biz. or pleasure led
Speight to seem the same as dead ?
Tell us, goddess white as snow
(Secret this between us),
Had a shaft from Cupid’s bow
Made him slave to Venus ?
Did he slip away to spoon
By the light of yonder moon ?
What became of potent Speight
Whilst they sought him vainly—
Did he go to bed at eight ?
Was it duty mainly
Took him from his office-chair
Far away to Lord knows where?
Goddess, in but virtue clad,
Queen of subjects all dead,
Tell us where that rorty lad
Hid his bouncing, bald head ?
Truth divine, this story tell
From the bottom of thy well.

Gentlemen,
I send you a photograph
of our‘twin’ baby girls, taken
on their first birthday, Novem-
ber nth. From birth they have
been fed entirely on your Malted
Food, and from being poor, frail
ittle mortals, whose lives were
despaired of, they have thriven
and become quite chubby and
jolly little specimens of baby-
hood. Moreover, so far, they
nave been entirely free from
illness of any sort. I ought to
say your food was recommended
us by ourfamily doctor. Kindly
post us the photographs back at
your convenience.
Yours very faithfully,
(Signed), JAS. WALTER.

My child, after being at death s door for weeks from exhaustion consequent upon severe diarrhoea,

I'.L. (B. Hill); Many thanks ‘The Bahy
Chestnut—like the other joke ... ‘ J. O. M‘0.’ (Meib.): A
Jot of words ana no meaning... 1 Banter ’ (Orange, N. S.
ales): “ Ardill, L.S.” doesn’t know every word of the
English language— probably not a hundred in a thousand.
It is absurd to say that tnere is no such word as " pre-
cludes ” . ‘Tiie Orphan’: No meat in it... ‘C.J.M.’:
Too crude. . ‘ II. Began’ (Castiereagh-street); Stories
containing 95°/ “ Flash Jim ” and tiie remaining 5% im-
probability aie getting wearisome. Besides, no sane man
womd biow his head off with dynamite because he
happened to lose a game of billiards ... ‘ A S tray away ’:
(1) Too incoherent. (2) H.L. and J.S. are one and the
same..., ‘ J.G.F.’ (S. Y.); Thanks ; will consider....
‘ 0 juel ’: Such a subject needs a light and strong hand.
You cannot effectively substitute mere vulgar cursing
for impressiveness and sandwich a tragedy with drapers’
jukes J.H.G.’: Too baluly put. Toj resent a con-
gregation with a plot of groumi and then mortgage the
church which they had erected thereon is just the
sort of thing you would expect from a much-respected
land - boomer who was chairman of the deacons....
Arcus.’; “ Unskilled labour” is a misnomer. There is
no such thing. Just you try pick-and-shovelling....
A. Craig”; The Bank of Ireland and many other “home”
banks issue Jil-notes anyhow.... ‘ J. Cruse’: There are at
most two men in Australasia in whom we believe suffi-
ciently to praise them while they are still alive. One of
them isn t ourself. We add this to save you wasting a
twopenny-stamp in mailing it to us ... ‘ Suffolk : Giving
‘ a vote for thrift” is often like giving a vote to the
alligator, which (it loves festering carcases) buries its un-
eaten victim in the sweltering mud bank for to-morrow’s
dinner. If one vote for thrift, how many for generosity,
and charity? The usurer is the most thrifty man....
-M.L. : Thanks ; but doesn't it strike you that the man
who has a tip to give ought to give it to himself ? “ When-
ever a man offers yon a horse cheap, ask him ‘ Why ?’ ,
‘Jack Grant’; Declined.... ‘ K. O'D.’: A bald truism.
The worker must be protected, as well as the products of
his labour. ‘ Autochthonologist ’ (Nanango, Q.):
.Spell “ Degilbo ” backwards, and you will have as good a
guess as any Mestonian oracle can give respecting its
meaning.... • .Marsupial ’ (Ada): Thanks ... ‘ Deepdene’
(B.H.); Many thanks... ‘H.O. (Wagga) : Your story of
the young man who slew' all his mother’s fowls with an
axe on his wedding-day is hereby declined ‘J.M.A.’:
Ves, they’ll soon Ife out—within a couple of months. The
other volume is also under way, but won’t be visible for a

Always quote the “National” when speaking of the

* ition, Wingadee, is not “ near Bourke.” It is between
Joonamble and Walgett—200 miles “near” Bourke....
Neta ’; Send us under published conditions one sketch,
teeping copy thereof..,. 4 C.C.’: Tiie Foreign-trade daily
papers claimed a £300,000 surplus for ‘ ex-Treasurer
MMIillan. Why did the latter, in his farewell speech,
only claim a paper surplus of £100,000 ?, .‘Jean Himeur ’;
Will read... ‘J. O. Wadson’: Have no means of
checking the valuations. All we know is that the thing
looks fishy, as the directors have mortgaged the calls on
shareholders which were the ultimate security of the
depositors.... ‘Anti-Twaddle ’: Competition would lower
the price of bread under the circumstances stated in the
paragraph thus; —Firstly, the increased local production
of wheat and flour consequent on the farmers having
secured the local market for themselves would ordinarily
ensure a full supply; secondly, when a ring of bakers
combined to raise the price of bread by £6 a ton, whereas
the duty charged on flour was ,t;X per ton only, other
bakers, seeing a big margin and a chance to cut
in, would attack them on their own ground.
Prices would then be reduced, fast enough.... ‘ A.
Kell’; It is much better, in a pecuniary sense, to
“wind-up” a bankrupt stock than to go burgling
P.M. : “ Ephiaites.” Unsuitable. Such a subject can
only be dealt with effectively by a big imaginative genius
or a big humorist, and you, up to date, are apparently
neither .‘The Colonel’: Yes, we believe that the death-
duties should be largely increased. We believe it still
more strongly since reading Max Nordau’s “Conventional
hies of Civilisation.”... : Griffith has got a brief
from the other side—that’s all ‘ William D.J.’; Good
sentiment, but badly put....‘A Rolling Stone’: Will
read .. ‘J.G.G.’: Thanks for cuttings. .‘Terence O'D.’;
You have apparently written in milk and water. Will
read when we rig up our biggest microscope—or borrow
George Reid’s eyeglass... ‘J.H.G.’: Will read “ By
Wire.”,...‘Jimmie IV: Bad joke to hand ‘Coo.
Green’: Will consider.... ‘ Dunbar’: Under considera-
tion. ... ‘ H. J. Mac.’: Letter to hand, but no song
R.W..M.’: Much obliged ‘ Bluegum ’ (Tas.); Much
obliged.. ‘ M. Cavander ’: Thanks. Next week, probably.
.... ‘ SnappnT T.’ (Croydon); Will read ...‘ K.’(Hobart):
May do, with revision ... ‘ E.F.S.*: Held for considera-
lion ,. ‘ Anson K.’: The honorary magistrate system is a
corrupt system. The man with social and business ties is
unfit to be a magistrate. No man can be a competent
judge in his own cause or in that of his friends. They
used to pack the benches in Sydney—pack them unblush-
mgly. They still pack them in the country districts. In
Melbourne they pack them all the time, and the only
letnedy is to altogether debar honorary beakdom from
sitting on the bench. (2.) If the Judge has, as would
appear to be the case, injured you by making remarks
based on a misconception, write him a letter explaining,
but lie careful to stick to the point. If you convince him
that he has acted unjustly, he will no doubt make public
reparation. (Many replies held over.)

N.S.W. Juniors, Driver and Camphin, played
remarkably good cricket for their innings of 71 each, and
the Britishers in the field looked as if they were
thoroughly sick of the contract.
* # #
It will set the minds of many people at rest, if
we state that the R. Driver who played so well in the
recent match—Sydney Juniors v. the Englishmen—is no
relative of old-time “Dicky” Driver. Camphin, who
shared the honours with Driver, is a son of the well-
known detective-inspector.

The listless way in which the Britishers
“knocked” about the field in the recent match with
the Juniors, meant stale as a week-oid loaf. Should
N.S.W. in the next match mind her p’s and q’s, she should
just about win.

If Percy M ‘Donnell, after two years’ absence
from the cricket-field, is considered good enough to play
against England, it seems a pity he did not come out a
few weeks earlier and show his patriotism by playing for
his province against Victoria. Rumour has it that
Percy’s resurrection is more due to the ambition of the
A.J.S. Bank than to any desire of the player.

The invincibility of the Sheffield sluggers was
not taken for granted by level-headed journals at
“home.” The Referee, for example, in discussing the
prospects of another Australian Eleven spec, this coming
season, says “ one risk of direful financial disaster must
not be overlooked. In the event of their (Australians)
getting licked by our assortment, at present on view down
under, the bottom must be knocked out of the enter-
prise.” Such event, you will observe, was not anticipated
i n a onirit of cocksureness by a paper that is worth paying

George Giffen is now quite an orator. Replying
at Adelaide welcome-back, he spoke for nearly three-

Massie’s 206 against Oxford in 1882 the most brilliant

England in Sydney eclipsed it.

The London Daily News, when the cable
reached it, giving the first innings scores of the Mel-
bourne test cricket-match, and showing England 20 runs

of its chosen ones.” Next day was published the simple
cable—“ The Australians won by 50 runs.”

WHO'S STOLEN MY KEY HOLE?
The problem of how to find the midnight key-
hole, no matter how unsteady the hand of the
belated reveller, has been solved at last. A large,
wide-mouthed funnel, the smaller end of which is
screwed to the door, covers the otherwise frisky
and evasive keyhole. Thanks to the shape of the
inside of the funnel, the wobbling and uncertain
key is surely directed to the keyhole, which would
otherwise not be there, the weary pilgrim
finds a haven of rest —that is, if he has the right
kind of a wife, who will meet him in the hall,
gently show him upstairs, and extract his weary
feet from the reluctant boots, as well as any spare
cash which may be reposing in his breeches pocket
—and say nothing about it in the morning.
The new funnel must be regarded as a great
boon, because it has happened more than once in
society life that gentleman have been obliged to
walk the streets all night, not because they were
reporters on the morning papers, or policemen, or
even domain “dossers,” but because the keyhole
was successful in evading their keenest search.
A much greater boon, however, than the keyhole
funnel for the amelioration of family care and
worry has been before the Australian public for
the last 10 years, and the said public has not been
slow to recognise its worth. The result is, if you
ask any Australian, no matter whether he adopts
that title or is native born, what is the best
remedy for lumbago, rheumatism, sprains, or
neuralgia, he will invariably answer: “Why, St.
Jacobs Oil, of course ! ” The proof of the pudding
is in the eating, and no one who has ever used St.
Jacobs Oil as an external remedy for pain will
ever use anything else.

The Waterbary Watches are meeting with
genuine approval on all sides. They sell upon
their merits. A discerning public has not been
slow to recognise that they are accurate, con-
venient, stylish in appearance, carefully con-
structed, and with absolutely interchangeable
parts. Their nominal price, too, is by no means
an unimportant feature. In the series for ladies
great improvements are to be noted, and these are
now turned out of a pattern and finish that cannot
fail to please the most fastidious. A word of
caution, however, is necessary. Don’t be misled
into buying inferior imitations of the Waterbury,
manufactured in Germany or Switzerland, and
not infrequently ensconced in Waterbury silk-
lined boxes the better to deceive the unwary
purchaser. Intending purchasers of the genuine
articles should note that every watch manu-
factured by the Waterbury Watch Co. has one or
both of the following distinctive marks on the
dial, viz., the word “ WATERBURY ” (in line
type) and the. interwoven letters “ W.W.C0.,”
without which no watch sold as Waterbury is
genuine.

The Late W. G. Wills.
We have all seen so many of the late W. G.
Wills’ plays that we must naturally be in-
terested a little in their author, who lately
died. Here is a picture of him —from the pen
of Augustus Moore
It will be with very sincere sorrow that poor
“Willie” Wills’ death will be heard of by all who
knew him. His work, like that of all men nowa-
days, has been absurdly overpraised, for there can
be no doubt that neither Ids painting nor his
poetry will live, for the simple reason that they
were both, judged by any high standard, about
as bad as they could possibly be. But of “Willie ”
Wills’ character nothing sweeter or more simple
in this world ever existed. I am speaking
with some knowledge, for I have known
him intimately for over 25 years. The
best part of his life was spent in one of the
Avenue studios off the Fulham Road, and never
since the world began was there a more curious
collection of artists gathered together. Next to
him lived poor young Good, the clever sculptor,
who lived with a horse and blew his brains out.
Then there was Miss Elizabeth Thompson, now
Lady Butler. But of these and other wonderful
people Wills was the most curious, and Iris studio
was the quaintest. Everybody lived there, every-
body painted there, everybody ate there and slept
there ; it was the refuge of the destitute. They
ate Wills’ food, they drank his whisky, they
wore his clothes, they pa’nted with his brushes,
they wrote with his pens, they smoked his tobacco,
and borrowed his money, and at night they covered
themselves with hiscan vases, and slept in front of his
fire. The door was never shut on anyone, and even
when Wills was writing the same went on. To
get something of silence and quiet Wills stayed in
bed all day, and wrote his curious blank verse on
little note-books about two inches square with an
infinitesimal stump of pencil. As each book was
filled he tossed it through the door to his secretary,
who somehow or other read it, and somehow or
other copied it out. This is how he did his work.
The studio was as curious as its owner and
denizens. The walls, as high as man could reach,
were one huge, chaotic memorandum book, ad-
dresses, appointments, accounts, and, indeed,
every form of memo, pictorial and literary, being
scribbled on the distemper in red, green, white,
blue, pink, black, and yellow chalks, which Wills
used for his pastelles, and nothing was funnier
than to see him trying to find out, say, when the
Princess Louise was coming to sit, and read-
ing out “Sally Hicks at 10,” “Chop, nine-
pence,” “Read play Irving,” and various
other notes extending over years. The
life, as may be imagined, was most primitive.
Wills and his secretary acted as cooks, and if you
called at lunch-time you would probably find, by
the’smell, a chop dangling from a string over the
gas-jet if the fire was not red, and often have I
seen a chop or steak, which had been sent out for,
thrown on to the fire to cook and picked out with
the tongs, and placed, black as a cinder, before an
astonished visitor. There was nothing vulgar,
inconsiderate, or pose in any or all of this curious
studio life. It was the outcome of pure simplicity
and good heartedness, for there, was nothing
sweeter than Wills’ character, for, despite his
somewhat neglige costume and habits, he was in
speech and behaviour a perfect gentleman, with
something of old-fashioned- deference which is so
charming. He had all the instincts of a poet and
a gentleman. His worst fault was his absurd
generosity. If anyone asked him for money—and
nearly everyone did—he said in his effusive Irish
way, “ Deloited, deloited,” and if he had a roll of
notes in his pocket he handed them over to his
suppliant to help himself, and if he had nothing,
as was too often the case, he would go out and
pawn his coat. He was indeed a beautiful nature.
He was absurdly good-hearted ; he meant all he
said, and he believed in his own “history,” which
was a reflection of his own ideas that kings and
gentlemen were always noble, and women were
good.
Here are some lines he wrote after the first
night of his play, “ Charles I.” :—
A FIRST NIGHT.
It comes at length the golden year,
The day that crowns my days,
My foes no longer dare to sneer,
My friends take heart to praise ;
And all is fair and all is bright
As could be wished by me—
I would that one were here to-night,
That one had lived to see.
And now I sit alone to think,
Even on a night like this,
Like some parched man who stops to drink,
Yet pauses in his bliss.
Now dreams of prose upon me break,
And nothing troubles me,
Save for this wish, this ceaseless ache,
That she had lived to see.
The rancour of old strife it dies,
Old cares I cast aside,
■ I gaze on men with kindlier eyes,
IJnwarped by want and pride,
I am aweary of the strife,
And now I will recline
In this sweet shadow of my life
This blossomed life of mine.
And all is calm, and all is bright
As could be wished by me,
And none save 1 can feel to-night,
And none save I can see.
Oh ! for her smiles that might have been,
Oli! for her lost delight,
' Her love and pride, if she had seen
The glories of to-night.
How one low word from her to me
This throned joy would crown,
The thought she did not live to see.
Strikes all my honours down.

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS
Proving the Wonderful Cures to be Genuine.
“ Herr Rassmussen’s World-famed Denmark Universal Pills are
purely Herbal, and is the best remedy in the world for curing and
preventing disease.”— The Times.
“ Herb Rassmussen’s, the Celebrated Danish Herbalist, well-
known Herbal Remedies have been the means of.performiug many
great cures during the last few years, as his numerous testi-
monials will prove/’—Sydney Bulletin.
“ Herr Rassmussen has shown us some highly complimentary
Testimonials which he has received, certifying to important
cures effected by his Remedies.” — Sydney Evening News.
“We have been shown some excellent Testimonials of the
great cures performed by Herb Rassmussen, tbe Celebrated
Danish Herbalist. Herb Rassmussen is a gentleman who has
gained for himself a reputation in the medical world of herbal
science. He has been practising as a qualified herbalist so long in
Sydney that his name has become known throughout New South
Wales and Australia.”— Australian Star.
“ We are continually receiving letters from Herr Eassmussen’s
Cured Patients, requesting us to make known the wonderful
virtues his world-renowned Herbal Remedies contain.”—
Sydney Weekly News.
“ Herr Rassmussen’s name has become a household word
throughout the Southern Hemisphere. He was presented with a
magnificent Gold Medal for some of his marvellous cures.’
Balmain Leader.
“ Herr Rassmussen is too well and favourably known to the
Australian public to require any additional praise from ‘ Truth.*
His Herbal Remedies are unequalled.”— Sydney Truth.
“ The remarkable Cures effected by Herb Rassmussen’s Herbal
Remedies are pretty generally known."— Balmain Observer,
“Herr Rassmussen, we are glad to say, as a Medical Herbalist,
bolds the highest place in the Colonies, and enjoys the confidence of
many of the leading people in N.S. Wales, Victoria, and Queens-
land.”— Cooktown Courier, Queensland,

A REAL MAN OP MARK.
“ Herr Eassmussen’s Cures are so remarkable that we make no
apology for referring to some of them. Mr. Eamsden’s case is tbe
most wonderful, and he cured him in six weeks, after all the
Sydney doctors gave him up. We may also state that a gentleman
in this district, who has been a martyr to the demon Dyspepsia for
more than two years, after trying several “doctors” with no
benefit whatever, is recovering under Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal
Treatment. In this age of unblushing quackery it is well to find
a man of Herr Eassmusseu’s undoubted skill, and we wish him a
lono- life to continue bis useful mission in the cause of suffering
humanity.”— Kangaroo Valley Pioneer, N S.W.

rank of Botanic Scientists ; now he is tbe Proprietor and Discoverer
of the famous Denmark Herbal Remedies, all of which have
secured the honest support of the people, not only of Australia,
but Africa, tbe United States, the British Kingdom and Italy.
It is not for us to enumerate tbe various remedies prepared by this
really learned man, but having seen and examined letters from all
parts of the world, we ar-e assured that be has saved a world of
suffering and cured people of many complaints, after they bad
given up all bope.”—The Australian Workman.— Sydney,
January tltb, 1892.

The Tug-of-War.
The drat night of the Tug-of-Warj at
Darlinghurst Hall, Sydney, Was a great affair;
There was a big crowd, mostly Irishmen and what
are called “foreigners.” The tugs took place on
a long narrow platform, having stout battens
nailed across it; the men laid their feet against
these battens and lay right down to their pull. It
was a straight-out test of strength and endurance;
but it was whispered about the hall that the
Irishmen and the West Indian darkies had not
room for their feet between the battens. This
should be seen to. There was a parading of teams
for a start, and a very fine-looking lot of men
they were. Then the Italians came out to pull
the Norwegians. The Italian teams were.mostly
fishermen; their rivals were sailots and wharf-
labourers, It looked any odds on the Norsemen,
who were a long way the heavier team, and they
won the pull. But the children of Garibaldi
fougnt firmly for every inch, and stuck to it for
half-an hour. It was a desperate struggle. The
crowd were very facetious, and yelled much good
advice to the fair-haired men—“ Now, boys, don : t
let the ice-cream push beat you,” “ Pull the organ-
grinders over,” “Go it, Macaroni,” —and so forth.
An interval for drinks —here the teferee took a
drink —and the Denmark team had a walk-over,
the Welshmen having scratched. The Taffies had
not time to get a team together. Then another
walk-over, France failing to appear against
Sweden. The frog-eaters rely mainly on style
and deportment in everything they do, and there
are no points given for style in tug-of-war !
# # #
Then came what was supposed to be the
tug of the evening, Australia v. Ireland. As
the teams took their places you could feel the
electricity rising in the atmosphere. The Irish
were a splendid team, a stone a man heavier than
their opponents all round, but the latter looked if
anything harder and closer-knit. As they took
their places the warning yells rang out all over the
building; “Now, boys, Sunny N.S.W. for it!”
“Go it, Australia!” And from the Irish side
came a babel of broad, soft, buttery brogue j “Git
some chark on yer hands, Dinny,” “ Mick, if yez
don’t win. niver come back to the Wharf no more,”
“For the love o’ God and my fiver, bhoysj pull
together 1 1 It was a national Irish team right
through—regular Donegal and Tipperaiy bhoys.
Ihe Swedes might have been Swedes from Surry
Hills, the Russians might have first seen the light
at Cockatoo Island, but there was no gammon
about the Irish. They were genuine; every other
ttiau answered to the name of Mike. They wore
orange and-green colours, to give the Pope and
the Protestants an equal show. Then they spat
on their enormous hands, planted tiled- brogues
against the battens, and at the stklndOf the pistol,
whiltf every Australian’s lieaft beat -high with
hope, the Mickies simply gave one enormous dray-
horse drag and fetched our countrymen clean
away hand over-hand, pulling them about ten
feet more than was necessary before they could be
stopped. How did their supporters cheer 1 Ahoo 1
Ahoo 1 The building rang again with wild shouts
of exultation. It was a great flay for Donegal
entirely, likewise for Cork and Killarney. The
Australians present palled their hats down over
their eyes and lodked at their toes. One man
wanted to back a team of light-weight jockeys to
pull anything anybody would fetch,' but' this
pleasantry could not avert the sting of defeat,
fhere was no disguising it —the Australians wore
‘ beat bad, ’ and the glory of Woolloomooloo had
departed,
* « .■*
Next came the West Indies Versus Maori-
land, which was a very funny business. The
Maprihinders Were small and weedy compared to
their sable opponents, but they hung on gamely.
The coloured gentlemen, as seen from the M.L.
end, presented a most remarkable sight. Firstly,
the eye caught the soles of their huge, fiat feet,
sticking up in the air like so many shovels; their
feet hid their bodies altogether, and only allowed
their heads to be seen-. The heads were all as
found as apples, black as ink, and each one had
in it two white dots —the glaring eyeballs of the
owner. As these remarkable people swayed in
unison behind the ramparts of their feet, they
looked like —well, it’s no good trying to say what
they looked like. There is nothing in heaven
above, or the earth beneath, or the water under
the earth, that will furnish the feeblest com-
parison. They pulled like good ; uns, and amid
loud yells of “Go it. Snowball 1” the Maorilanders
were pulled over, lighting hard to the last.
# • *
Then “Rule Britannia ” from the band,
and the English team marched on to the platform
- all very neatly dressed, neatly shaven, moving
with great precision. “What are they at all?”
“A team of marines from the men-of-war. ’ They
look'd fit to pull a house down. Then the squawk
of the band changed to “The Watch on the
Rhine, ’ and the sons of the Fatherland came up
to do or die for the country of sauer-kraut. It
looked any odds on the English. But they were
white-skinned and flaccid, while the deep, sunburnt
hueof theother arms told of hard, toughening work,
Bang went the pistol, and after a terrible tussle
the Rhinelanders fairly wore out the Britishers
and scored a gallant win. There was a strong
British section present, and their disappointment
was intense. A man-o’-war’sman was with diffi-
culty stopped from climbing on to the platform
and offering to pull the heads off the whole blanky
Hutch team. This win was a surprise, but a
bigger surprise was in store when the Russians
met the Scotch. Where they found a team of 10
Russians in Sydney goodness only knows, but
they were gaunt, wiry, hard-featured men—some
of them obviously Russian Finns, than whom the
earth produces no stronger or more resolute race.
Their opponents had a smug, comfortable look,
and seemed a long way the stouter men. The
Russians were all seamen and seafaring men of
some sort. At the signal to go, the Russians
gained a little, and then began a tremendous
wavering pull, each side alternately gaining and
losing. The Scotch supporters cheered their men
on with wild cries. The Australians impartially
barracked both sides. First they would give the
Scotch a turn—“ Go it, Donald ! ” “ Haul away,
Sandy!” “Go it, Burgoo 1 ” Then they would
turn their attention to the Russians—“ Go it,
Siberia!” “ We’ll have to get the knout to you
follows,” and so on. But all the foreign nations
seemed to form a sort of Mafia to encourage the
Russians against the Scotch. Norseman, Dane,
and Dago joined in the wild chorus of encourage-
ment. An old man, apparently the father of
one of the Russian team, danced alongside the
platform shrieking in every language under the
sun. The man he was cheering was a
great- broad-chested giant who threw his
mighty strength on to the rope in tre-
mendous surges, and at every pull the old
Whether on land or at sea, on the prairie or in
the crowded city, Ayer’s Pills are the best

tnan would howl—“Go oil) Manuel! you’re doitig
splendid.” Then he would sing out something
like “ Kychjhnoo,” and Manuel Would give
another heave that would fetch the Scotch team
another two or three inches at least. He was a
magnificent man, was Manuel. The great wiry
muscles stood out on his arms like knotted ropes.
And when at last it only wanted site inches more
fob a win, Manltel lifted his head and gave the old
sailor-cry that the men of the sea know so well
and respond to—“ Yo, heave-ho-o-o-o-o,” and the
subjects of the Great White Czar gave one mighty
lift that fetched the Scotchmen away as if they
had been children. It was a grand pull, and
one's sympathies went with the little band
of Russians, because if they are really Russians
(their faces seettled Slavonic) there must
have been Very few men to pick from, whereas
here every third man is a Scotchman. It will be
seen, therefore, that the Germans beat the
English, the Russians beat the Scotch, and the
West India blacks beat the Maorilanders. Per-
haps (Whisper it softly)—perhaps the British and
the Australians are not the only strong and deter-
mined races on the face of the earth after all.
* * *
The Irish on the first night certainly
looked like winning. It is said that the
team has been carefully picked—-that scores of
men were tried and rejected before the team
was formed. The Continental nations have
very few men to choose from. The Australians
ought to go and practise pulling the hair off a
pound of butter before they compete. They may
do better later on. We intend to be there again
for a good long evening when the black men meet
the Irish. And if you want to get your two
eyes knocked straight into one, go and “ barrack ”
against the land of Erin.
* » •
In Australia, however, nothing is com-
plete without a strike, and on Monday the teams
mostly struck. They wanted a total sum of =£ls6
a night, and the management didn’t see it. Then
the Italian gentlemen, full of a desire to recover
their lost glory, offered to throw themselves into
the gap, and were set down as “ scabs.” By and
j bye a compromise was arrived at, and the show
began 45min. late. Scotland and Norway took
the rope and in six minutes the former went under
amid the ruins of the thistle and the haggis,
while a spectral voice in kilts groaned
over their discomfiture. Russia, with the
potent Manuel on deck, broke Germany up in
about 12 minutes, and the signs, at time of writing,
seem to be that the sons of the Great White Czar
will come out on top. Manuel —we are not
quite sure that his name is Manuel, but it
doesn’t matter —is an awful snag to strike,
especially when his aged father barracks for
him and urges him on. The longest pull of
the evening was between the Englishmen and the
West Indian darkies, and here for the first time
the Anglo-Saxon race got a show. It took them
over an hour to do it, but at the end of
that time Ham went under. He deserved
better luck, did Ham, especially as he is
the lightest team in the show. Australia again
had the distinction of knocking under in shorter
time than anybody else; he was a disgraced
kangaroo in just 33 seconds, the Maorilanders
bolting with him as if they intended to rush down
to Circular Quay. Ireland also went under to
Sweden, which was a painful surprise to many
individuals named Mick, Terence, and Hinny.
Last of all, Italy came on to give a mighty heave
for the honour of the banana-vending industry.
Denmark took the other end of the rope and held
it for 33 minutes, ahd then the stupendous efforts
of the fallen Romans carried the day. France
and Wales both failed to turn up.
* * •
After Monday night’s proceedings, Norway,
Sweden and Russia were ahead with two wins
each, and Ireland, West Indies, Italy, England
Denmark, Germany and Maoriland had one
apiece. France and Wales have been on strike
since the start, and Scotland and Australia come
in dejectedly at the tail with two blanks. If
Manuel’s boiler doesn’t burst, or his father
doesn’t break a blood - vessel while howling
for him, Russia should win the big prize ;
and Italy, if only on account of the demoniac
energy of the hulking gentleman with the
large feet who pulls at the extreme end of the
rope, should be close up. Thk BcLUStIN suggests
that that huge Roman and Manuel should pull
each other single-handed at the close of the pro-
ceedings. It would be a gaudy spectacle, The
Roman’s name, we believe, is Julius Caesar.

How Babs Malone cut down the Field.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Now the squatters and the “ cockles,”
Shearers, trainers, and their jockeys
Had gathered them together for a meeting on
the flat ;
They had mustered all their forces,
Owners brought their fastest horses,
Monaro-bred—l couldn’t give them greater
praise than that.
’Twas a lovely day in Summer, .
What the blacksmith called “a hummer,”
The swelling ears of wheat and oats had lost
their tender green,
And breezes made them shiver,
M Trending westward to the river—
Ihe river of the golden sands, the moaning
Eucumbene.
If you cared to take the trouble
Y ou could watch the misty double,
ihe shadow of the flying clouds that skimmed
the Boogong’s brow,
Throwing light and shade incessant
On the Bulls’ Peaks’ ragged crescent,
Upon whose gloomy forehead lay a patch of
winter’s snow.
Idly waiting for the starting .
yl the race that he had part in,
Old Gaylad stood and champed his bit, his
weight about nine stone ;
His owner stood beside him,
Who was also going to ride him,
A shearer from Gegederick, whose name was
Ned Malone.
But Gaylad felt disgusted,
lor his joints were fairly rusted,
He longed to feel the pressure of the jockey on
his back,
And he felt that for a pin he’d
Join his mates, who loudly whinnied
or '*‘m to go and meet them at the post, upon
the track.
I roni among the waiting cattle
Game the sound of childish prattle,
And the wife brought up their babe to kiss his
father for good luck ;
' ai 'i Malone: il When lam seated
VV u * fßlylad, and am treated
ith fairish play, I’ll bet we never finish in the
ruck.”
But the babe was not contented,
Woi gU pinafore was scented
ith oranges, and sticky from his lollies, for
. he cried,
this gallant little laddie,
- s he toddled to his daddy,
id raised his arms imploringly, “Pease, dad,
div Babs a wide. .
Then the father, how he chuckled
Tli ° l • P r ide of it, and buckled
e surcingle, and placed the babe astride the
racing pad ;
He did it, though he oughtn’t,
And by Providence he shortened
The stirrups, and adjusted them to suit the
tiny lad
Who was seemingly delighted,
Not a little bit affrighted,
He sat and twined a chubby hand among the
horse’s mane,
His whip was in the other ;
But all suddenly the mother
Shrieked, “Take him off!” and then “the
field ’’came thund’ring down the plain.
’Twas the Handicap was coming,
And the rhythm of their drumming
Beat dull upon the turf that in its summer coat
was dressed,
The racehorse reared and started,
Then the flimsy bridle parted,
And Gaylad, bearing featherweight, was strid-
ing with the rest. >
That scene cannot be painted,
How the poor young mother fainted,
How the father drove his spurs into the nearest
saddle-horse,
What to do ? he had no notion,
For you’d easier turn the ocean
Than stop the Handicap that then was half-
way round the course.
On the ‘ ‘ bookies ” at their yelling,
On the cheap-jacks-at their selling,
On the crowd there fell a silence as the squadfon
passed the stand ; 1
Gayest colours flashing brightly,
And the baby clinging tightly,
A wisp of Gaylad’s mane still twisted in his,
little hand. ~
Not a thought had he of fallihg,
Though his little legs were galling,
And the wind blew out his curls behind him in
a golden stream ;
Though the motion made him dizzy,
Yet his baby-brain was busy,
For hadn’t he at length attained the substance
of his dream !
He was now a jockey really,
And he saw his duty clearly
To do his best to win and justify his father’s
pride,
8o he clicked his tongue to Gaylad,
Whisp’ring softly “ Get away, lad ; ”
The old horse cocked an ear, and put six inches
on his stride.
Then, the jockeys who were tailing
Saw a big bay horse come sailing
Through the midst of them with nothing but a
baby on his back,
And this startling apparition
Coolly took up its position
With a view of making running on the inside
of the track.
Oh, Gaylad was a beauty,
For he knew, and did his duty ;
Though his reins were flying loosely strange to
say he never fell,
But held himself together,
For his weight was but a feather ;
Bob Murphy, when he saw him, murmured
something like “Oh, hell ! ”
But Gaylad passed the filly,
Passed Jack Costigan on “ Chili,”
Cut down the coward “ Wakatip,” and chal-
lenged “ Guelder Rose
Here it was he showed his cunning,
Let the mare make all the running,
They turned into the straight at stride for
stride and nose for nose.
But Babs was just beginning
To have fears about his winning,
In fact, to tell the truth, my hero felt inclined
to cry,
For the “ Rose ” was still in blossom,
And two lengths behind her “ Possum,”
And gallant little “ Sterling,” slow but sure,
were drawing nigh.
Yes, Babsie’s heart was failing,
For he felt old Gaylad ailing ;
Another fifty yards to go, he felt his chance
was gone.
Could lie do it ? much he doubted,
Then the crowd, oh, how they shouted,
For Babs had never dropped his whip, and now
he laid it on.
Down the straight the leaders thundered
While the people cheered and wondered,
For ne’er before had any seen the equal of that
' sight,
And never will they, maybe,
See a flaxen -headed baby
Flog racehorse to the winning-post with all his
tiny might.
But Gaylad’s strength is waning,
Gone, in fact, beyond regaining,
Poor Babs is flogging hopelessly, as pale as any
ghost ;
But he looks so brave and pretty
That the “ Rose’s ” jock takes pity,
Arid, pulling back a trifle, lets the baby pass the
post.
•••. • • • •
What cheering and tinkettling
Had they after, at the “ settling,”
And how they fought to see who’d hold the
baby on his lap ;
As President Moutgom’ry,
With a brimming glass of “ Pomm’ry,”
Proposed the health of Babs Malone, who’d
won the Handicap.
BARCROFT H. BOAKE.
A scandal has been caused in Brisbane by
the pitch-forking of lecturer Brooks, ex-M.L.A.
and ex-sky-pilot, into the position of librarian at
the local School of Arts in place of Dudley
Eglington, 17 years librarian. Brooks, who wrote
a lot of fiery rant against trades-unionism, &c.,
during the shearers’strike, was a member of the
committee which found fault with and “sacked ”
Eglington, for whose dismissal no substantial
reason has been offered.
An Interesting Failure.
The dreary round of commercial failures in Mel-
bourne is brightened, now and then, by an indi-
vidual case of such exquisite humour, that the
creditors of the insolvent institution find consola-
tion in the thought that they have bought into a
first-class joke, so to speak, on fair and equitable
terms. The larger their share in the insolvency,
the more joke they get for their money. Messrs.
Tunnock and Co., Limited, a concern engaged in
the manufacture of blacking and other groceries,
recently called a meeting of creditors and share-
holders, for the purpose of considering what had
better be done under the circumstances. The
paid-up capital was some =£4ooo, the outstanding
debts amounted to another <£4ooo, and the position
of the company was simplicity itself. It had
melted into a tender memory of the past, A
demure-looking gentleman, with large, melan-
choly eyes, fired off the calm, judicial an-
nouncement that Tunnock and Co., Limited,
was as dead as the Duke of Clarence, and
its sacred ashes had become merged in the
Mercantile Loan, Finance and Guarantee Co. The
entire show was in pawn for nix, and the directors
hadn’t got the ticket. They couldn’t offer the
meeting so much as a drink out of the assets, or
suggest the dark, evil-smelling composition of a
cake of blacking in the pound. In fact, they
would have been forced to call the meeting in the
open air, and tell their side-splitting yarn upon a
piece of waste ground, but for the kind considera-
tion of the Mercantile Co. in loaning them their
lost manufactory and guaranteeing that they
wouldn’t be arrested for breaking into the
premises. The stock piled around them was no
longer theirs to offer at an alarming sacrifice.
Blacking, blacking everywhere, but not a cake to
eat. And the book-debts of the vanished com-
pany had, by some weird, mysterious, financial
arrangement, gone the same way as the boot-polish
and soap and things. All was lost save honour. The
M. L. F. and G. Co. as it appeared, administered
the “happy dispatch” to Tunnock & Co., with a
bill-of-sale, or some similar deadly instrument.
The sheriff having seized the entire bag of tricks,
put Tunnock & Co, up to auction in an unusually
quiet sort of way, whereupon the Mercantile
Finance came upon the scene, and, like a huge
boa-constrictor, swallowed the carcase of the
factory which it had already, in the ordinary way
of finance, pinched to death. The metaphors
around here are not a bit more hopelessly mixed
than the transaction in question. The price paid
by the M.L.F. & G. Co. for Tunnock & Co. at
auction was understood to be <£7o, or there-
abouts, i.e., the purchasers had bought their
own property in at that modest figure.
When the shareholders and creditors of the
annexed institution had been given time to
understand that there was nothing left to hold
shares in or prove debts against, the fun branched
off in a new direction. A committee of enquiry
recommended that the victims of this droll
calamity should form a new company for the pur-
pose of buying back the so-called “assets” of
Tunnock and Co. for .£750, from the Mercantile-
Finance crowd, who had generously consented to*
hand over the blacking, book-debts, and sundries*
for eleven times as much as they paid for them at
auction. A certain whiting mine, formerly
belonging to Tunnock and Co., was not to be
included in this proposed sale, however, probably
because it is valuable. They will take ,£750 and
keep the whiting, and the late shareholders and
creditors in Tunnock and Co. are earnestly

requested to roll up and subscribe to this good

amongst them is to go to the devil, and leave the
original committee to form their own company
out of the ruin they have wrought.
A distinguished Sydney equity - lawyer
now appears on the block with whiskers as black
as a crow, while his hair is as grey as a badger’s.
Not long ago a prematurely grey attorney and a
Sydney barrister, who hid his grey hairs under
cosmetics, were engaged on opposite sides in a
backblocks District Court. A question of prac-
tice arose, when the barrister sneered: “A man
at your time of life ought to know.” “You may
sneer at my grey hair if you like ; my hair,will be
grey as long as I live ; yours will be black as long
as you dye.”
One of the most guileless observations on
record appears in the report of the alleged “ Elder
exploring expedition ” :
After passing through 250 miles of desert it would have
been unwise to continue in unknown country.
Think of that! The great, expensive, gilt-edged
expedition which took its dress-suit and its eye-
glass out into the wilderness and went exploring
in a white shirt and a bell-topper grew depressed
when it saw 250 miles of unknown country, and
decided that it was “ unwise” to see any more of
it. What sort of a name would (say) Sturt have
left behind if he had collapsed every time he saw
250 miles of unknown country? The Elder ex-
pedition is the sort that ought to go exploring in
a bath-chair with a porous plaster on its chest.
A large and blusterous Yankee book-tiend
got on the razzle-dazzle the other day in aN.S. W.
bush township, and held possession of the place
for several hours. He first drank all his money
and then he drank his bogus jewellery and his
samples, and after that he drank his superfluous
clothes ; and then he was cast out of the pub. for
want of anything else to drink. Being thus
wrecked in a drought-stricken world he looked
round for someone to borrow from, and noticing
that the storekeeper was a meek-looking little
man with weeping whiskers, he walked into his
premises with a fire-eating, boiling-water-drinking
expression in his eye, and demanded the loan of
ss. Being refused, he took off his coat and jumped
on it to show that he was indignant, and explained
that if the cash wasn’t forthcoming he would
jump on the storekeeper as well, and then jump
his stock on top of the storekeeper, and the
store on top of the lot. The little, harm-
less tradesman surrendered on hearing these blood-
thirsty threats, and the book-fiend went back and
swam in liquor so long as the money lasted. When
it was gone he came back for ss. more, and got it
also. It looked, in fact, as if he had appointed
the storekeeper as his banker, and meant to draw
on him regularly for an indefinite period. But at
the fourth or fifth visit the dealer stopped the
supplies, and then the canvasser tore off his coat,
and leaped on it, and volunteered to tear the
whole shop asunder. Next he took off his hat and
dashed it on the floor, and offered to kill any man
who trod on it. It was evidently a gage of battle
and the storekeeper promptly bounded on the
hat with both feet. Then there was a long
pause. The canvasser was evidently moved, and
tears came into his eyes. Twice he tried to speak
and his voice failed him. Then in tones that were
broken by emotion he remarked : “ Old man, you
might have wiped the mud off your boots first.”
And with that he gathered up the coat and the
shattered hat and retired from the scene.

IV.— The Prisoner’s Statement.
“Sir, and the Honourable Court, —I stand
charged with a crime. To understand the crime,
1 must describe my life.
“ It is now almost seven years since I received
the scrape of a pen from anyone belonging to me.
And from the following, which is an extract of a
letter I received from my eldest sister, Jeany (a
woman of very great sensibility, tenderness, and
affection, and for which I did not blame her in
the least, as she was obligated to write me in such
a manner by my father). From such an extract,
Sir, it will appear-very evident unto you that it
would be the height of folly in me to entertain
even the most distant hopes (much less sanguine
expectation's) of my connections ever doing any-
thing to forward my future welfare in life. After
a Jong preamble, resembling a Methodist parson’s
sermon, her letter concludes thus :
* A common soldier, a disgrace to your family and
connections —alas ! what have you brought yourself unto
—what money has been lavished away upon your educa-
tion and profession, all to no good purport? You might
have been a credit unto your family. You are no longer
any utility to yourself nor to society, the grand end for
which you were created. You never write to your friends,
only when you wish to drain them of money. Do you
suppose because your brother-in-law is a respectable
merchant that he is going to advance money io a man he
knows nothing at all about ? These are notions which are
very fallacious, and which will never be realised. There-
fore, as you have made your bed, so may you rest your
bones.’
“To such bitter invective, Sir—to such severe
animadversions upon my conduct in consequence
of past follies, &c. —I returned an answer as
follows :
Dear Father,—l embrace this opportunity of writing
home (if I may still, with any propriety, call it home) by
Captain W , of the N.S.W. Corps, a gentleman
whom, I informed you in my last, has, in conjunction
with my offleers in general, ever treated me with the
greatest kindness—and upon all occasions studied to ease
me to the uttermost—being stationed at an outpost on
the Hawkesbury, about 40 miles distant from Head-
Quarters.
With regard to any further particulars—l mean, with
respect to myself—l have nothing to communicate unto
you, having been repeatedly led to understand from the
tenor of your letters, as also my sister Jeany’s, that I
need look for nothing from you, nor indeed from any
of my friends, and that, as I have made my bed, so
might I rest my bones. You having, therefore, come
to such determination, it would be folly in me to the
uttermost to expatiate upon such subject—and, indeed,
to tell you the truth, it is a matter of very little indiffer-
ence to me whether you do or not, as my age and the un-
certainty of life, at the best of times, have taught me to
treat with indifference and contempt all wealth, grandeur,
&c., and to conclude with Solomon that it is all vanity,
&c. Being therefore perfectly reconciled to my fate, I
shall neither stoop so low as ’to beg, nor, indeed, to ask
any favours from any of you. Such being the case, per-
haps you may reply, what induces me to be repeatedly
writing you. My answer is that my education has taught
me it is my duty at all events to pay respect to you upon
account of your being ray parent. My letters, therefore,
to you, as also my sister Jeany, have always been couched
in the most respectful terms, but I cannot say so much
for your answers, as they have ever breathed a spirit of
the greatest rancour and malevolence, in consequence of
the follies of juvenile indiscretion, and which, from the
distance of time, ought long ere now to have been buried
in utter oblivion. But whatever errors and sallies of
youth may have precipitated me into during the former
part of my life, of this much I am very sensible, that all
of you are fully determined not to give me another trial
during the latter part of it. Such being the case, I bid
you a Anal adieu, humbly hoping that the Author of my
Existence will, whenever it shall be His pleasure to call
me hence, not deal with me quite so roughly as you have
done.
You demanded of me a certificate from my officers
respecting my military conduct. In compliance with
such your request, I herewith transmit it you—although
even here I am very sensible that such letter will avail
hut very little. You also required from me a history of
this country, which very much surprised me, upon
account of you, yourself, being an old soldier, and not
recollecting at the same time that it would neither he
political nor prudent in me, by reason of such my
situation, to enter upon such particulars.
With my natural love to you all, and compliments to
all enquiring friends.—l am, dear father, yours, &c.,
John Fudgeon.
“ This correspondence, Sir, and the Honourable
Court, will inform you of the causes of the reck-
lessness which has marked my character
The President here put it to the Court whether
prisoner should be further heard. And the Court,
deciding in the negative, the issue was as per
record.
P.W.
Joys that are No More.
Dear Bulletin,— While hunting up information cor
cerniug the early life of our dead “ Singer of the Dawn *
Henry Kendall, I stumbled across—in the Empire of’a
date 31 years ago—the enclosed little lyric, written by hi«
twin-brother, Basil E. Kendall.—Yours truly, Stewart o'"
Mitchell, Jan. 22, 1892.
See how the light recedeth, love,
The shades are falling fast,
And mantling o’er a sunless world
That weeps for glories past—
The glories of departed days
Which shone on sea and shore,
Now lost in darkness, faded out
Like joys that are no more.
How fair the moon is gleaming, love,
Through yonder shadowy trees,
Where swamp curlews their mournful songs
Chime to a mournful breeze—
The breeze that wanders here and there,
The hills and valleys o’er,
Like some lone heart, it seems to sigh
For joys that are no more.
See how the water glistens, love,
Upon the pebbly strand,
Where solemn ocean tells his tale
Of sorrow to the land.
The waves, returning constantly,
Cling fondly to the shore,
Like memory lingering round the graves
Of joys that are no more.
The morning will return, love,
And smiles will hail its birth,
And sprinkle rays of gladness o’er
A dark and cheerless earth ;
But will it bring those early days—
Those happy days of yore—
The spring-time of our life, or wake
The joys that are no more?
BASIL E. KENDALL.
The present alleged total wealth of Aus-
tralia (1,136 millions) is almost one-half of the esti
mated wealth of England in 1822 (2,600 millions)"
The human bones found near River
have turned out to be those of an aboriginal. The
police have consequently given up the investiga-
tion. —-Newspaper Extract.
One day while digging bj' the sandy river side
“Old Bill’’found something bony—something that had
died. *
Tho’ to geology and such he’s not addicted,
Still well he knows the earth’s by nature not afflicted
With jawbones and with skullbones and a dozen ribs
Or more—he didn’t wait to count, ’em did “ his nibs.”
Man’s bones ! Foul play no doubt had placed them in
that shrine
’Midst sand and mud, where leeches crawl and wild-fowl
dine.
Plain was his duty to the law, himself and State—
The ’pleecemust get the wind, and go and seek the fate
Of one, a brother man, and run to earth the Cain—
Who had, with ruthless hand, this nameless brother slain.
The ’pleece in eager haste, like bloodhounds after prey,
Well arm’d, well mounted too, rushed madly to the
“fray”—
For don’t you kno w that clever captures mean promotion,
And don’t you know, you surely must, the great com-
motion
That dead men make, throughout this bright and sunny
land—
Those dead men that get buried somehow ’neath the sand?
The bones were rooted up and laid out in the Court,
The doctor came to view ’em and to make report.
Quoth he, “An aboriginal once held his hide
Up with these bones ;it doesn’t matter how,he died."
The ’pleece got orders to disarm. “Our luck !” they sigh.
For don’t you see, it matters not how “ darkies ” die.

and eruptive blemish.
They are pleasant to the taste.

They are positively beneficial for children.
They are a gentle and efficacious medicine in the rational
treatment of constipation and haemorrhoids (piles).

germs or disease growths in the blood.
o o
They are good for the liver, by reason of their tonic and

Taylor and Matthias Larkin, the two
biggest embezzlers that Victoria has raised for
many years, have each a separate cell in Mel-
bourne gaol, and sundry small comforts and con-
veniences have been added to the usual furniture
in order to soothe their feelings. And meanwhile
the small thieves, who took a handkerchief or a
pair of boots apiece, are packed a little tighter
even than before to provide this accommodation,
and sleep in rows on the floor each with his foot
in the next man’s ear.
Cabled that the Czar re-institutes serfdom.
Serfdom is not an old arrangement. It was only
established about 1721, by just such a measure as
the Czar contemplates now. About half the popula-
tion were slaves, and the idea struck the nobility
of collaring the lot. So they made an Uncle
Tom’s Cabin arrangement, that the people might
be bought and sold, even families cut up—only
not by auction. The late Czar, in 1861, freed 40
million serfs—half of them Crown property, the
other 20 millions private goods.
A South African lawyer tells a story of an
ante nuptial contract. The contract is signed
before a notary by the male prior to marriage,
with a view to settling property upon the female.
An ante nuptial contract had been signed in his
presence, and the happy pair had gone on their
honeymoon and returned again, when one day
they rushed into his office with the astounding
intelligence that they had been told they
were not married. “Absurd,” said the lawyer,
“show them your certificate.” “What certifi-
cate ? ’ “ Why, the marriage-certificate given by
the minister.” “ What minister?” “The minister
who married you.” “No minister married us,”
said the wife —“you married us.” The guileless
pair had taken the anti-nuptial contract to be a
legal wedding.
The calm monotony of existence down at
Swan Hill (Vic.) was recently disturbed by the
suspicious behaviour of a lone, lorn spinster, who
first loomed upon the locality with a baby in her
arms, and was presently observed to be coming
back from somewhere in an excited state, but
without a baby. The awful tidings were spread
around by an elderly man, who drives the local
punt, and the whole township began to sniff red-
hot blood. Search parties were despatched for
the purpose of discovering the remains of the late
lamented infant wrapped in an evening newspaper,
whilst the more old and gouty section of the
population stayed behind to keep an eye on the
lorn female and see her commit self-destruction.
A first-class murder and suicide was the very
thing they wanted to wake them up at Swan Hill,
but their hopes were crushed again. The missing
baby had simply been left unexpectedly to the
care of its alleged father, and the people who went
forth to find a tiny corpse found nothing more
horrible than a flabbergasted married man wrest-
ling with the tangible result of an unhallowed
passion, and feebly requesting his injured wife to
fill the feeding-bottle. As for the spinster mother,
she put a finishing-touch to the tragedy by sud-
denly disappearing in the next train for Melbourne.
WRECKED ON THE GOODWINS.
Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of the famous
Charles Darwin, the naturalist, inscribed upon his
seal the significant words, “ Omnia ex ronchis” —
all things arise from oysters. But from what do
oysters arise? What is the origin of matter?
Ah! nobody knows. Yet one thing is getting
plainer every day. Let this man’s story show.
He goes on to say : “ On the 17th of December,
1872, whilst acting as ship’s carpenter on board
the steamship Sorrento, I was wrecked on the
Goodwin Sands. The shock to my system was so
great as to produce an effect I never felt before.
I fell into a low, weak state, and was seized with
giddiness and a sinking, fainting feeling. I had a
bad taste in the month, weight at the chest, and
great pain after eating, and my face would burn
like fire. I had difficulty in breathing and palpi-
tation, and often a pain seemed to run from the
heart through to my shoulder. I had a kind of
rumbling all over me, and a choking sensation at
the throat, with a rush of blood to the head.
“I slept very badly, and after a time I got so
nervous and. weak I was afraid to go about, and
would sit in a chair quite powerless. I saw a
doctor, who treated me for a time, and then sent
me to a hospital in Rattlebone Place, London,
whsre I was under treatment for three months,
but got no better. I then put myself under a
local doctor, who said I was suffering from
nervous debility. He patched me up for a little
while, but said to my wife, ‘Your husband is in a
critical condition, and may die at any time.
“ However, I got to work for a short time, and
then was as bad as ever. I lingered on in this
way for years—now a little better, now worse, but
never well.
“ About 1880, whilst working at Messrs. West-
wood and Bailey’s, Millwall, a mate who saw my
sufferings told me of a medicine called Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup, and he brought me a
bottle. After taking the first bottle I found my
food agreed with me, and I began to improve.
All nervous feeling gradually left me, and by per-
severing with the medicine I was soon cured.
From that time to this I have been a strong man,
and done harder work than ever in my life before.
I have since kept Mother Seigel’s Syrup in the
house, and my wife, who was a great sufferer
from. rheumatism and dropsy, has found more
relief from it than from anything else. If any of
my family ever ail anything, a few doses soon sets
them right.”
The statement from which the foregoing is an
extract was made by Mr. William Hill, ship’s
carpenter, 108, St. Anne’s Road, London, E.
Now, what is the thing which we said is getting
plainer every day ? Why this : that almost an
infinite number of different results arise from a
single cause. Like the majority of people in all
ranks ol life, Mr. Hill had in his digestive organs
the seeds —or what women, when they buy dress
goods, call “the makings”—of dyspepsia. Up to
the winter of 1872 it may not have troubled him
much, but the excitement and exposure of the
shipwreck was more than the system could bear.
We must remember, too, that all shocks to the
mind or body, or to both, act directly on the
stomach. Who can eat when under the influence
of a great worry or a great sorrow? And if this
worry or sorrow continues long, it always upsets
digestion, permanently impairs or destroys
the appetite, and thus brings on an apparently
incurable dyspepsia and nervous debility. Why,
gracious goodness ! there are millions of women,
and lots of men, crawling about under this thing
in England every day in the year. And it is to
them we are talking. They are half dead, and
we want them to come to life, and get some good
out of their existence. Whatever the ailment is
called, you may be sure indigestion and dyspepsia
is at the bottom of it, as in Mr. Hill’s case, and
what cured him will cure you.

An of Melbourne Gas Company
has lodged a serious complaint against a lady,
who, as he alleges, is in the habit of assuming a
theatening attitude every time her gas is cut off,
an event which occurs about five times a year on
an average. Last time he went down to chop away
the meter he was entrapped into supposing that
“themissus” wasn’t at home, but directly he had
severed the service pipe and was busy plugging up
the hole, a large, muscular female started to
baste_ the back of his head. It then became a
question of whether he should let the gas escape,
or attempt to escape himself. At duty’s call he
decided to stand by the severed pipe and complete
his task. The lady of the house emptied a sauce-
pan full of Irish stew over his devoted head, and
nearly broke his arm with a dumpling, after
which she chased the unfortunate man off her
premises with a meat-axe. The Metropolitan
Gas Company is a bloated monopoly, but there
are times when the down-trodden consumer is
able to chip in and avenge a few wrongs.
The newest form of advertisement is the
professional “ window-gazer.” He is a well-
dressed individual, who walks carelessly up the
street in company with another “gazer”—they
always go in pairs. As he passes his employer's
shop he is struck all of a heap by the beauty and
cheapness of the contents, and he strikes an atti-
tude of rapt admiration before the window, and
calls the attention of his friend in a loud tone of
voice. The friend is also staggered, and they
point out the things to eacli other till a crowd
collects. Then they go on their way, and half-
an-hour later they come up the street again, and
are floored a second time. Sometimes the pair of
window-gazers work for half-a-dozen firms, and
all day long they walk round, and strike paralytic
shapes and attitudes before their bosses’ em-
poriums, A good “gazer” makes money at the
business, but it is weary work to travel about and
be an astonished citizen in front of a series of
windows for twelve hours per diem, especially
when the boss is keeping a note of his appearances,
and will dock his screw if he doesn’t turn up
twenty-four times in the day, with the same look
of surprise and admiration every time.

In the early days of the British professional-
beauty mania, when the Jersey Lily and Mrs-
Cornwallis West were struggling for supremacy,
the latter charmer was photographed in the
capacity of a romping mother, giving a x>ick-a-back
ride to a pretty little girl. That picture was all
over London, and had a big sale at a shilling.
The little girl has been growing older since then,
it appears, for she hooked a German Prince —
Henry of Pless—recently, and Albert Edward,
who used to make eyes at the lovely mother,
figured at the wedding-breakfast of her lovely
child.
For some reason which nobody has ever
explained fat men are more emotional than thin
ones. Treasurer Thomas MTlwraith (Q.), now
at war with the Bank of England, is a fair
example of this. He is a huge individual with
burning hands and hot feet and a masterful coun-
tenance, but he can be moved to tears much easier
than most men. At a banquet, when, he is the
honoured guest of the evening, and the liquor has
gone round copiously, and the room is stifling,
and there are cigar-ashes and decanters every
where, and everybody is perspiring, and the gasp*
ing congregation has opened all the windows bu
no breath of air comes in—nothing but murky
heat and green bugs and old, tired beetles—then
MTlwraith’s emotions come out strong. One
speaker after another gets up and orates about
him, and tells what a truly noble character he
is, and how much he has done for , a
suffering country, and as he listens to
them a mist of tears gathers in the big man’s
small eyes, and he makes a great effort to smother
his feelings. Then he gets up and responds with
a tremor in his voice and a look of grief on his
countenance. It is a thing to be remembered —
the spectacle of an inflamed fat man in tears. For
the fat man is apt to be bald as well as corpulent,
and when he is bald and his grief becomes too
much for him the top of his head always smokes
from perspiration and excitement and inward
combustion, and if 16 fat men were overcome at
one and the same moment they would assuredly
set the premises on fire. Why M‘IIwraith weeps
surreptitiously at these times can only be con-
jectured. Possibly he is grieved to think how
badly the orators have been taken in ; possibly he
only does it on general principles.
