The “KEEPER” PILE PILL
(Registered).
The PROPRIETORS of these Pills are well aware that
there are many remedies (some of them really beneficial)
for this painful disease already in the market, but know-
ing as they do the wonderful success of the “ KEEPER ’’
PILL they have no hesitation in placing'it in the very
front rank of Curative Medicines.
For years the medicine had only a local and limited
■use, but now arrangements have been completed to make
its merits more widely known, and the Australasian
■colonies will have an opportunity of sharing with the old
■country the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will be sold on its merits, in confident
assurance that its beneficent action will be a real boon to
■sufferers.
It will not cure Piles in old and chronic cases by a single
■dose. It will not cure every disease that flesh is heir to,
Unit it will cure Piles if taken in reasonable time, and
IT WILL GIVE RELIEF IN ALL CASES,
however stubborn and chronic, and the proprietors are
continually in receipt of most flattering and unsolicited
testimonials. Price, 2 6 per box (red label).
The “KEEPER” LIVER PILL.
We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids which are
complicated with liver trouble, and we have therefore
perfected a Liver Pill to be used alone, or in conjunction
with the “Keeper” Pile Pill. We do not claim for this,
or for any of our preparations, any marvellous curative
properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/3 in a box of “ KEEPER ’’
LIVER PILLS (blue label) and you will not regret it.
The “KEEPER” HEALTH PILL,
If you are worried in business, if you are jaded by over-
work, if you are generally run down from any cause, TRY
THIS PILL. It is a prince of pick-me-ups. In one size
only (brown label), 6 6 per box.
The title the “ KEEPER ” PILL is registered as our
trade mark throughout the colonies, and any infringement
thereof will be promptly dealt with by the sole proprietors,

A BIG BIZ!
Our Trade is Big I Our Store is Big 1
Our Ideas are Bigl
We get bigger every day; on Saturday night
we are bigger than on the previous Monday,
and on the Wednesday following we are bigger
still. We can’t help growing. We have all the
elements of growth. The soil we are planted in
is good, the climate propitious, the people kind.
We are continually watered by the lifegiving
showers of a nation’s approval. Can anyone
wonder that we grow ?
Our growth is a wonderful thing. People
describe it as magical. There is no magic in it.
Anyone, or any set of people, can do the same if
they do as we have done. But they don’t; they
can’t find the way, charge too much for the privi-
lege of doing business with them, and generally
and deplorably make a mess of the whole affair.
That’s the mischief.
Most People Like Us I All Believe in Us!
Not a Few Swear ly Us I
It’s cupboard love. We suit them, make their
money go a long way, and generally render the
path of life an easy one. There’s no sentiment
about it. It’s real biz, and no mistake. In that
way we are beloved throughout Australia, the
measure of affection each one bestows upon us
being gauged by the amount of benefit received.
The more you buy at our store the greater your
liking for us will become, because the more you
invest with us the better dividends you receive.
If living IN THE COUNTRY, send for our
Catalogue and Patterns of anything you require;
if in town, call every day.

Itching Skin Humors
Torturing, Disfiguring Eczemas
And every species of itching, burning, bleeding, scaly, crusted, pimply,
and blotchy skin and scalp diseases are relieved in the majority
of cases by a single application, and speedily, permanently and
economically cured by the Cuticura
Remedies when the best physicians,
hospitals, and all other remedies fail.
No language can exaggerate the suf-
fering of those afflicted with these dis-
eases, especially of little babies, whose
tender skins are literally on fire.
CUTICURA
Remedies are the greatest skin
cures, blood purifiers, and humor reme-
dies of modern times, are absolutely
pure, and agreeable to the most sensi-
tive, and may be used on the youngest
infant and most delicate invalid with
gratifying and unfailing success.
Cuticura, the great skin cure, instantly allays
the most intense itching, burning, and inflamma-
tion, permits rest and sleep, heals raw and irri-
tated surfaces, cleanses the scalp of crusts and scales, and restores the hair. Cuticura
Soap, the only medicated toilet soap, is indispensable in cleansing diseased surfaces.
Cuticura Resolvent, the new blood and skin purifier and greatest of humor reme-
dies, cleanses the blood of all impurities, and thus removes the'cause. Hence, the
Cuticura Remedies cure every humor of the skin, scalp, and blood, with less of hair.
4®““How to Cuke Diseases of the Skin and Blood,”64 pages, 300 Diseases, 50 Illus-
trations, 100 Testimonials, is wrapped around every bottle of the Cuticura Resolvent.

‘A GOLDEN SHANTY.
Kaleidoscopic Politics .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As broken glass reflects the rays
Of passing light a thousand ways.
And offers to the gazer % view
An ever-changing form and hue,
To one fast law no instant true,
So moves that mass of shams and tricks—
Kaleidoscopic politics.
Strange ! one straight truth can never reach
Its destined goal in human speech ;
But, biassed by the mind’s condition,
Is twisted out of recognition,
And, like a turbid stream, exudes
In dull and endless platitudes,
That gurgle o’er the suff’ring ground
To swell the awful sea of sound.
We’re weary of the ass’s bray—
The little dog that barks all day,
The hound that nightly bays the moon )
O Lord ! in mercy send them soon
To that bright corner of the skies
That Satan viewed—Fools’'Paradise.
We’re sick of the undying screech,
The dreadful and eternal speech,
Of brazen cheek and leathern lung,
Of thorax tough and ceaseless tongue
That’s most tenacious in the wrong,
Arid on this earth has wagged too long.
Amid the din a nation’s prayer
Arises on the tortured air :
“ O, mighty Author of the spheres
Give peace unto our suffering ears,
And with Thy lightning dart transfix
These conjurors in politics,
Who cackle o’er the empty theme,
And brooding sit on addled scheme.
O Lord ! the voice of Chaos cries,
Plant some sure symbol in the skies,
And, ’mid the dark, infernal din
Let some unbroken ray stream in.
W.B.N.
William Turner, who suicided in Melb.
the other day because his sweetheart had joined
the Salvation Army, gave full and particular
orders for his coffin and funeral before walking
into the Yarra. Very considerate conduct, but it
has its drawbacks. How unpleasant to be sued
by your undertaker should you change your mind
before getting into the water, and not have the
cash to square up for your coffin !
The emphatic and useful little word,
Damn, according to the latest dictionary—Dr.
Murray’s—comes from an Indian root. In India
there used to be a small coin called a dawm, valued
at about the 1600th part of a rupee. When a
man says he “don’t care a damn,” he only means
that he doesn’t care a copper-coin worth that
fraction of a rupee. Pity that so good a word
should have so cheap an origin.
A Dublin Trinity College-man, after serv-
ing a term under N.S.W. Education Department,
wen* to Queensland as a teacher, and thence
graduated as agent, reporter, and actor to unem-
ployedism. Then one day he asked a rag-and-bone
picker for a job. The latter was also a man of
education, but he was educated in rags and bones,
not in classics. “Go to Hades,” he said, briefly ;
“ what do you know of my profession ?”
The Archbishop of Canterbury has found
a convincing reason why the Church of Wales
ought not to be disestablished. It is the oldest
portion of the Church of England, so old that the
modern Welshman, as a rule, is unable to name
an ancestor who professed to belong to it. And,
as regards tithes levied upon dissenters, the
Archbishop explains that tithes are not really
taxes in Wales, but a grant set apart hundreds
and hundreds of years ago. Their extreme age
ought to make ’em sacred, he thinks. A century
hence there would be nobody left in the Welsh
Church except the parson, but the “ Canterbury”
of 1995A.D. would plead all the more earnestly for
the dear old tithes, because they were another
hundred years older.
A once well-known municipal potentate,
who faded away out of the memory of p ople in
Victoria years ago and is generally supposed to be
dead, was heard of the otiier day. He runs wild
along with a tribe of blacks in the scrub regions
of the Coen (N.Q.). The ex mayor is dressed
chiefly in a sugar bag ; his hair hasn’t been cut
for some years; and when he pelts through the
scrub with his unkempt mane flying behind him
he is a fearsome spectacle. He is a hatless, shoe-
less being with a harem, and is about as aboriginal
as the aboriginals themselves. His wife and
family in Victoria draw the rents from !>is pro-
perty, and have done so ever since the old man
vanished in the N.Q. wilds,- and they are
likely to continue doing so undisturbed.
Eor the old man isn’t coming back. He is
quite contented roaming the scrub with his
harem, and his niggers, and his fellow-derelicts.
There are a good many wild and greasy wanderers
of his kind in Carpentaria, and most of them are
known vaguely as Bill, or something to that
effect. No man who disappears mysteriously in
Australia can be safely set down as dead until
the scrub-country has been raked for him, and it
is definitely proved that he isn’t there. Some
of the more recent mysteries of Austra-
lasia, and a good many of ancient date, might
possibly be cleared up by a careful search in the
regions of Cape York Peninsula, or thereabouts.
A good many brown, neglected-looking waifs and
hermits and odd Calibans of these parts', if
they were caught and washed by the strong arm
of the law, would be found to be persons with a
history attached to them.

The Federal Balance-Sheet.
A century ago, or thereabouts, there lived
one Sieves, who made constitutions for
the first French Republic. He supplied
the country with quite a number of them in
his time, and he generally kept two or three
new constitutions on hand to be ready for
any emergency. They were exceedingly
beautiful constitutions, all of them, and,
theoretically, almost perfect, and under each
successive constitution the value of the
assignats kept falling, and the Treasury kept
growing empty, and the army became more
hungry and shoeless than under the one
before. The moral of which is that the most
symmetrical constitution ever invented can do
very little good by itself, and Australia,
which has been busy for some time past,
officially and unofficially, in drafting experi-
mental constitutions for the Commonwealth
that is to be, would do well to recognise this
fact. So far, experience has shown that it
is comparatively easy to draft a constitu-
tion —or half -a - dozen constitutions—for
Federated Australia, and exceedingly difficult
to get Australia to federate under any of
them. Of the obstacles in the way, the
first and, at present, the most trouble-
some —the indifference of the masses—
will doubtless remedy itself in course
of time. The opposition of the Fat Man
Governments of Queensland and Westralia
will also remedy itself when the Fat Man
dies of his own excessive girth. Even the
provincial jealousies over the division of
power in the Federal Parliament may not
be an absolutely hopeless element. But the
most unpromising feature in the case at the
present moment is that politicians in all the
provinces have begun to figure up the assets
which each province will bring into the
Commonwealth, and the liabilities which it
will shuffle off on to its neighbors, and to
publish estimates according to which it
appears that each writer’s own particular
province will be badly defrauded when its
assets and liabilities are pooled under
Federal control. And, as the most beautiful
constitution which the brain of man can
devise will furnish no means by which the
provinces can combine on terms of absolute
financial equality, all this balancing of
accounts looks unpromising.
• # *
No person in his senses, who had seriously
considered the question, ever supposed that
Federation could be arrived at on purely
equitable terms. If the Commonwealth is
to start by each province putting exactly the
same proportion of capital into the partner-
ship, then there will never be any Common-
wealth. If union is to be postponed until
some scheme shall be devised by which each
province will furnish exactly the same
revenue per head of population as every
other province, then there will be no union
in our time, or in the time of our sons, or
our grandsons, or at any other measurable
period. The Commonwealth must take over
the debts of all the individual provinces, and
some of the more heavily-indebted States
will thereby shuffle off a portion of their
burdens on their neighbors. It must take
over the railway systems, which bear no sort
of proportion to each other in value, and
probably the public lands, which are also a
variable quantity, and it will impose a
common tariff, which will produce a much
larger revenue per head in some provinces
than in others. Then, whether it returns
all surplus revenue to the Provincial Govern-
ments in proportion to the amount contri-
buted by each province, or in proportion to
population, or in any other proportion, it
will—as can be shown by figures—inflict a
serious injustice in any case on one or other
of the States. All of this, no doubt, is very
regretable, but Federation is not an exact
science, and theoretical injustice is unavoid-
able.
* * «
Taking the public debt as the first and
most serious item in the account, this varies
from £74 per head in Queensland down to
about £4O per head in Victoria. The
average rate is a little over £5O per
head, so the immediate result of Federa-
tion would be that each Victorian would
be saddled with a further liability of
£lO per head, each Westralian with a
liability of £6 per head, and each inhabitant
of New South Wales with a liability of
£2 10s. per head, while a resident of South
Australia would be relieved of a burden of
£l5, and each Queenslander would profit to
the extent of £24. The position of Tas-
mania would be practically unaltered. This
would be the immediate result, but with the
more rapid increase of population in the
large provinces of New South Wales and
Queensland it is quite probable that, 20
years hence, Victoria might be profiting con-
siderably at their expense. In proportion to
population Queensland has the largest State
railway system ; then follow South Aus-
tralia, Western Australia, Tasmania and
Victoria, with New South Wales a very bad
last. The cost of construction varied from
£14,743 per mile in New South Wales and
£12,665 in Victoria, through varying degrees
of extravagance down to £4441 per mile in
Westralia, and there is no sort of proportion
between the debt to be handed over to the
Federal Government and the railway assets
which accompany the liability.
• * •
The difference in the revenue from rail-
ways is another serious discrepancy. In
N.S. Wales and South Australia the railways
almost pay working expenses and interest on
capital expended, and if the Federal Govern-
ment consolidates the aggregate public
debt into one uniform 3 per cent, stock,
which should be easy of accomplishment, the
railways of these two provinces would pay a
handsome dividend. Under the same sys-
tem the Victorian lines would about pay
their way in the present, and would also
yield a profit in the future. But the lines of
Tasmania and Westralia are worked at an
enormous loss, and those of Queensland are
also very unprofitable. With the debt
placed on a 3 per cent, basis, the whole rail-
way revenue of Australia, according to the
latest returns, would just cover expenses and
interest, and thus iTasmania would shift its
burden on its neighbors and give nothing in
return for this assistance, and Queensland
would shift its railway deficit and one-third
of its debt as well on to the other provinces.
• * •
If the Federal Government takes over the
public lands of the various provinces, there
is again no sort of equality. Tasmania,
which would gain slightly by handing over
its public debt, and enormously by transfer-
ring its unprofitable railway system, would
hand over by far the smallest asset in land.
South Australia, which would lose heavily
by handing over its lines, would give up to the
central Government perhaps the most valu-
able property of all. Westralia would con-
tribute an immense area of unsold desert.
Victoria would surrender the least of all the
continental provinces. Considering, how-
ever, the differences in value per acre and
other circumstances, it is impossible to form
any accurate estimate, except in the case of
Tasmania, which would obviously come off
best in the deal. Possibly, however, public
lands will be left in the hands of the pro-
vincial Government, so that this item may
not appear in the balance-sheet of the Com-
monwealth.
» • •
As already mentioned, the Federal Govern-
ment would almost certainly be able to
convert the Australian public debt into a
uniform 3 per cent, stock. By this means
all the provinces would profit largely,
but South Australia, Westralia and Tas-
mania would profit especially through the
superior credit of New South Wales,
Victoria and Queensland. The aboli-
tion of border customs duties w'ould also
involve a sacrifice which would be very un-
equally distributed. By the transfer of the
posts and telegraphs to the Commonwealth
Government, South Australia would hand
over a profitable business and take a share in
the losses of the other provinces, and Vic-
toria, where the department makes only a
small loss, would suffer considerably by
amalgamating with Queensland, Westralia,
and Tasmania. Victoria would surrender a
very large excise revenue, and New South
Wales one somewhat smaller, while the
other provinces would contribute almost no-
thing under this head. Until the conditions
of the various provinces assimilated, South
Australia would supply twice as much Cus-
toms revenue per head as Victoria, and
three times as much as Tasmania. Victoria,
as the principal manufacturing province of
Australia, would profit most by the abolition
of internal customs duties, and the establish-
ment of a uniform tariff against the outside
world. Also in a number of other ways the
loss or gain by the unification of Australia
would be distributed in a most unequal
fashion, and in no single particular, how-
ever small, is it possible to suggest a method
by which Federation can be accomplished on
an absolutely equitable basis.
m • •
The object of all this is merely to
prove the uselessness of going into financial
details on such a subject. Federation can-
not be arrived at in any fashion which will
prevent every province profiting in some
way, for a time at least, at the expense of
its neighbours, neither is it possible to make
the gains and losses balance each other so as
to arrive at even a rough semblance of
equality. Therefore the only logical course
is to federate for the sake of making Aus-
tralia a nation, and to leave wholly out of
consideration the odd coppers of provincial
discrepancies. Likewise, Federation cannot
be arrived at in any way which will give each
province a mathematically correct proportion
of political influence, nor can the Federal
capital be located in every province at once,
and there isno guarantee that the Federal rail-
way department will be able to apportion ex-
pend! ture on future public works so as to give
each province its exact share, either accord-
ing to its necessities, or its population, or
its contributions to the Federal exchequer,
or on any other fixed principle whatever.
And, though the probabilities are that the
various discrepancies will gradually diminish,
this is merely a probability, and there is no
possible guarantee that they won’t become
worse instead of better. The economies to
be effected by consolidating the public debt,
the judiciary, the alleged military and naval
establishments, the railways, and many other
public departments will be very great —so
great that, in all probability, even the pro-
vince which loses most by the partnership
will be better off than it was before, but
even this isn’t absolutely certain. And,
under these circumstances, the only thing to
be done is to leave off adding up figures and
counting possible losses, and endeavoring to
arrive at an impossible balance, and to
federate without taking any thought for the
morrow. The advantage to be gained is
more than worth the sacrifice. No one can
tell exactly what the sacrifice in any given
case may be, but the advantage is worth it,
anyhow.
Australian Appeals at Law.
Does dog, then, eat dog ? Is there no honor
among sharks ? Here is lawyer G. B. Barton
arguing in February Cosmos that the idea of
appointing an Australian Judge to the Privy
Council “ seems too absurd to be seriously
entertained,” unless—here is a loophole-*-in the
case of “a retired Australian Judge who had
really distinguished himself by his general
powers of mind, as well as his legal ability.”
And then he grasps all Australia’s benches in
the hollow of his forensic palm and remarks
that they are but a pinch of dust, after all.
Considering the source, his admissions are
startling. “By no chance can Australia hope
to see for many years to come a race of J udges
fairly on a level with those of England.”
“Judicial appointments in Australia are too
often bestowed as the reward of political ser-
vices without sufficient regard to the public in-
terests.” “A vacant Judgeship is now the
lawful prize of an Attorney-General; but that
officer is rarely, if ever, the leader of the Bar
otherwise than ex-officio, because the leader of
the Bar cannot afford to become an Attorney-
General. Thus the Bench has long been, and is
apparently destined to be ” —are your Honors
listening?—“recruited from the second and
third ranks of the Bar—a state of affairs
which has never been seen in England,
and never will be.” Then Mr. Barton pro-
ceeds offensively to clinch his argument by an
illustration drawn from the ’9l case of R.
v. M‘Leod, when a man was convicted by a
N.S. W. Court of Quarter Sessions of bigamy
committed in the United States, without objec-
tion by the Supreme Court, to which the case
was subsequently taken. When defendant ap-
pealed to the Privy Council, the J udicial Com-
mittee quashed the case at once on the ground
that N.S.W. Courts had no jurisdiction to deal
with crimes committed abroad ; and the Judi-
cial Committee was thereupon severely lectured
for its ignorance by local Bar and Bench. All
this is very gratifying to Australian Judges,
and still more gratifying to the public, who in-
variably expect when lawyers fall out to get a
better grip of the justice which they call their
own.
• • *
But when Mr. Barton's arguments come to
be seriously considered, they have little force
for laymen. For example, in referring to the
Supreme Court of Australia constituted by the
Federal Constitution Bill of ’9l—on the
ground, as stated by Mr. John Downer, that
“ Australia has reached a stage of national
life in which we are fairly competent to manage
our own concerns, not merely political, but
judicial as well Mr. Barton’s comment is
that it seems singular that statesmen “ should
have shown themselves so ready to throw
away one of the fundamental rights and liberties
of the British subject ’’—meaning, apparently,
the right of appeal to the Privy Council. Pass-
ing the objection that the connection which
makes Australians British subjects is only a
temporary connection, inevitably to be set aside
sooner or later, Mr. Barton’s fallacy is
obvious. The “ fundamental right and liberty ”
of the British subject, so far as it has any
value, is not the right of appeal to the Privy
Council, but simply the right of appeal. The
right of appeal to CLesar was not cherished by
the Roman citizen simply because Caesar was
Caesar, and enjoyed ipso facto superhuman
wisdom. In creating an Australian Appeal
Court we do but exchange one for
another—a foreign Caesar for a Caesar at
home. Our “ fundamental right and liberty ”
of appeal subsists unchanged.
• • •
But Mr. Barton affirms that there are in
Australia no Judges fit to assume the responsi-
bilities of an Australian Appeal Court, and that
there will be none for a considerable time. “ A
degree of confidence is universally felt in the
judgments of the Judicial Committee which is
not met with in the case of our own Courts.”
Admitting, for argument’s sake, that this is so,
it is plain that, law technicalities apart, the
confidence is ill-founded. Mr. Barton naturally
judges from a lawyer’s point of view ; but, to
everybody not a lawyer, the exact interpreta-
tion of the letter of the law is of far less
moment than the just interpretation of its
spirit. The Judicial Committee is admirably
fitted to supply the one ; it is certainly incap-
able of giving the other. Accustomed to Eng-
lish conditions, saturated with English
precedents, what can it know of conditions
peculiar to Australia, of the precedents which
every day we are creating ? And who will con-
tend that justicecanbe done by a tribunal utterly
ignorant of the circumstances under which its
suitors appeal for justice—ignorant even of the
laws which should govern its decision ? For
the formidable mass of Australian legislation is
now being so rapidly increased that it is diffi-
cult even for lawyers on the spot to keep pace
with and assimilate it. Does any sane man
believe that the members of the Judicial Com-
mittee even attempt the task?
• « •
And, in spite of Mr. Barton, this incapacity
of the Privy Council in Australian cases is no
mere imagination. Greater confidence in the
judgments of the Judicial Committee, con-
sidered as a whole, is not felt by the Australian
public—probably not by the weightier half of
the Australian legal profession. There do
arise occasionally cases which hinge upon that
portion of the law of England which is practi-
cally unchanged in Australia ; and in these, no
doubt, the Judicial Committee’s* judgment is
more authoritative than would be that of any
Bench of Judges brought together in Aus-
tralia. But such cases are rare swimmers in
the vast whirlpool of appeals which impera-
tively demand for decision some knowledge—
often a great deal of knowledge—of Australian
laws and conditions. The attitude of the Judi-
cial Committee to such cases is simply pitiable,
as Mr. Barton well knows. Its members
have no choice but to pick up their knowledge
of law and facts from the addresses of counsel,
and, blinking feebly over their glasses, to apply
English precedents as far as (or farther than)
they will go, and plunge wildly into a decision.
• « •
Were there no alternative course, the ap-
pointment of an Australian Judge to instruct
this incapable committee would be absolutely
necessary. As there is an alternative course in
the creation of an Australian Appeal Court, the
“idea,” as Mr. Barton says, “is absurd”
not for the reasons hinted by Mr,
Barton, but because it is foolish to
send suitors to England to get what is,
on the whole, worse law and less justice than
the law and justice dispensed in Australia. It
is admitted that an Australian Appeal Court
would not be as perfect as it might be ; but
that is a defect which the lapse of time will
steadily remedy, while the unfitness of the
Privy Council to dispense justice to a self-
governing community of millions of souls,
16,000 miles away, must steadily increase.
And, even if an Australian Appeal Court w ere
much worse than it is likely to be, it is still in-
finitely to be preferred, on account of its local
knowledge and local training, to any foreign
court whatever. Mr. Barton errs in thinking
the public demand that the decisions of its
courts should tally exactly with the devious
course of English law since Edward the Con-
fessor. The public can do without accumulated
precedents as long as they get common sense
and a reasonable amount of equity applied to
the construction of Australian statutes. Let
English lawyers interpret English law : let
Australian law be decided by Australian
lawyers in Australia.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
B. R. Wise’s Amendment.
B. R. Wise, M.L.A., the benevolent theorist
of N.S.W. Assembly, came forward with a
theoretically-beautiful amendment on the Land-
Tax Bill, which amendment was promptly
rejected by a big majority. Mr. Wise’s theory
was that the State, when valuing land for taxa-
tion purposes, should exempt the amount ori-
ginally paid for it to the Treasury, and levy an
impost only on the additional value which it
has gained by increase of population, the build-
ing of roads and railways, and other circum-
stances. Thus if a man bought 10,000 acres


from the State at £1 an acre, and it is now
worth only 19s. 6d. per acre, it would be wholly
exempt from tax, while if another man bought
100 acres at the same price and it is now worth
JB3OO in all, he would be taxed on the £2OO of
added value. In other words, Mr. Wise wanted
to lay down the just principle that the unearned
increment belongs to the State, and to assert
the principle by taxing the unearned increment
accordingly. All this was strictly in accord with
Single-tax principles ; also, it was strictly in
accord with a certain kind of theoretical justice.
Still, the Assembly was distinctly justified in
Jumping on the proposal as it did, the only
pity being that the Assembly jumped on it
apparently from no good motive. To all
appearance it objected, not because it saw that
Mr. Wise’s theoretically perfect amendment
was all wrong in practice, but merely because
it was hot and flurried and in a bad temper,
and didn’t care much for justice, theoretical or
otherwise. Yet there wefe at least five good
reasons for its conduct, had it only known them.
(1) The small agricultural owner should be
exempt, if there is to be any exemption at all,
even though he has a large unearned increment,
and the large owner should not be exempt,
though his land is now worth less than lie paid
for it, simply because it is the policy of every
State to encourage small holdings. They lead
to better cultivation, and they create a large
class of independent agriculturists, whereas
large holdings create a small body of wealthy
owners and a vast, helpless, servile mass of
underpaid laborers. (2) The large holder often
has no unearned increment solely through his
own fault. Increment comes from population,
and, where half - a - dozen men shut out
the public from 500,000 acres of land,
they prevent any serious increase of population,
and reduce the value of the soil through their
own greed. Therefore, Mr. Wise proposes, in
such cases, to exempt the big holder because of
the injury he has done to the community. (3)
The small holder’s allotment is generally
increased in value because of the labor he has
; spent in improving it; the large grabber’s pro-
perty often fails to increase in value because he
jhas snatched more of the public estate than he
,can put to any profitable use. B. R. Wise
imakes no allowance whatever for this very
,obvious contingency. (4) The large grabber’s
[land deteriorates also, as a marketable asset, in
many cases for want of a convenient market
; and for want of railway communication, simply
because, by shutting out population, he makes
iit impossible that there should be a market,
and he keeps the country a desert so that there
iis no population to support a railway. And (5)
B. R. Wise’s statement that it isn’t the purpose
of the State “ to punish men for holding land,”
is partly correct and partly incorrect. If
he holds enough land for the comfort-
able maintenance of himself and family,
and puts it to a profitable use, there-
by enriching the country, he should not
be punished. If he holds it for purely specu-
lative purposes in order to block settlement and
force up prices by creating an artificial scarcity,
or for the purpose of letting it and living on a
rack-rented tenantry, or if he doesn’t put it to
profitable use, and merely, through indolence
or cussedness or some other cause, prevents
other people using it, to his own loss and that
of the country —in all these cases he should be
punished for holding land. The “unearned
increment,” as B. R. Wise uses the term, has a
comforting sound, but the nation can’t live on
sounds, and it is impossible to cure all the ills
, of the community with a single dogma, whether
it be Protection, Freetrade, Single- tax, Teetotal-
ism, or anything else. Therefore, the dogma-
, tist of one idea is only a dreary and useless
ibore.
The Importer’s liOgic.
Melbourne Argus, which has been taken
worse ithaaa usual of late over the tariff question,
Stad .another bad attack the other day, when it
attempted to define its faith as follows :
We fo*v t e itodwe toy our exports from the land ; we have
to sell our iproduce abroad. And our exports will be paid
for by imports. Ju the list twenty years we have ex-
ported produce ixova Victoria to the value of more than
£250,000,000. And every penny of payment for this pro-
duce has been made in (roods, and every penny of pay-
ment for the next £250,000,000 of produce we ship will be
made in goods also. . . Our toilers want the most they
can obtain for their produce, and they are not served,
but they are injured, when the high-tariff man steps in
with his assertion —“ The smaller the payment from
abroad the better,”
This beautiful piece of logic almost arouses an
idea that the Freetrade organ is off the remains
of its head, and has been putting an enemy in
the hinder-pocket of its pants to steal away its
brains. Who, or where, or what is that alleged
Protectionist who says that “ the smaller the
payment from abroad the better ?” If Victoria
sells goods in England, and takes English goods
instead of cash in return, it buys them at
English prices, and whether Victoria charges
100 per cent, duty on them or no duty at all,
the quantity it gets in England is exactly the
same—unless, indeed, the duty makes the seller
eut down his prices, and give more goods in
■ order to compete with the Australian manu-
facturer. Moreover, it is pure drivel to say
1 that every penny of payment for Victoria’s
exports, or any other country’s exports, comes
in goods ; a whole lot of it merely comes in the
: shape of the British money-lender’s receipt for
■the half-year’s interest, and the rest generally
■comes in goods, and if there is a balance against
■ us it is either paid in gold or else is liquidated
Iby exporting this country’s I O U. The mere
[fact that Britain buys from the United States
ito the extent of <£9i,000,000 annually, and only
:sends back goods to the value of £35,000,000,
is a solemn evidence that a country only takes
payment in goods when it wants to, and not
•otherwise. Also, the fact that Australia has
■accumulated a debt of several hundreds of
millions is another proof that goods aren’t
necessarily paid for with goods, for this country
has evidently bought some hundreds of
millions’ worth of goods which it hasn’t
been able to pay for, consequently it owes
the money to this day. And this country
still keeps on buying goods which it can’t
pay for with other goods, consequently the
debt keeps increasing, and the country keeps
hard-up, and the Argus keeps on making a
fool of itself by telling an impossible story about
an alleged state of things which never existed,
and never will exist. And, even if the Argus’
impossible theory could be true, it doesn’t
amount to much. If Victoria did live by selling
its raw material in London, and getting back
its exact value, less freight, manufacturers’
profits, wages, commission, exchange, &c., on
finished goods, why shouldn’t it live equally
well by selling its raw material to local manu-
facturers, and getting back its value in finished
goods from them, and thus save the freight and
commission and exchange, and keep the wages
and manufacturers’ profits in the country ? It
is all very good to bash down the dogma that
we “ have to live ” by our exports and get im-
ports in return ; but why have we ?
The Pitt Town Martyrs.
Were the judgments of the Labor press any-
thing more than a mixture of sentiment and
shriek, the five men cast out of Pitt Town
(N.S.W.) co-operative settlement might easily
be pedestailed as the Pitt Town martyrs.
Their condition in no way justifies such
canonisation. No doubt it was foolish of New
South Wales Legislative Council to insist on
the disenrolment of the single settlers. They
might have been left to sink or swim with the
married ones, seeing their numbers were so few,
and that, anyhow, a single man has quite as
much right to be supported by the State as a
married one— i.e., he has no right at all. For
the common preference of married men to single
ones as objects of beneficence involves a very
obvious fallacy. Certainly, a married man is
worth more to the State if he supports himself
and his family. But if he comes demanding State
soup, all his marriage means is that there are
so many more mouths for the spoon to go into.
Marriage, in such a case, simply implies that the
man, careless of responsibility, has treated him-
self to the pleasures of a wife and trusted to le
bon Dieu to feed her and the children. As le
bon Dieu, in practice, is simply the congrega-
tion of taxpayers, and as there is no earthly
reason, generally speaking, why one fellow
should be taxed to feed another fellow’s pro-
ducts, aid should be rather withheld from, than
given to, the reckless and thriftless married
man, were it not that we must take facts and
twins as they are, and that the bitter cry of the
outcast latter is not easily to be disregarded.
But the single man, the man who has pru-
dence and self-restraint enough not to bring
into the world mouths which he can-
not feed, should certainly not be victim-
ised on that account only ; and from
this point of view the single men of Pitt Town
have valid ground of complaint. From any
other point of view their complaint has no
ground whatever. What are the facts ? On
July 21 next the Pitt Town settlement will have
existed two years. To the end of last mouth
<£6778 cash had been expended upon 100
families. Not .£3OO had been earned. The
improvements—including settlers’ huts, fencing,
and other things, which have little or no value
when the settlement is disbanded—are esti-
mated as worth ,£5991, so that the labor of 100
men and a number of youths for 19 months has
failed to earn rations for themselves and
families. There is now no doubt whatever
that, as soon as the Government subsidy
stops, the settlement must stop too.
The five complainants have had for 19
mouths their daily bread —including, pre-
sumably, their share of the currants and
raisins, pills and painkiller, pipes and tobacco,
bird-seed and balsam and cocoa, into which
“ daily bread ” is translated at Pitt Town—
found for them by the hard-working community
outside the Arcadian fence, who toil, many of
them, 10 hours a day to help to supply the cash
which the strictly 8-hour Arcadians absorb
with such alacrity. How much longer do the
men disenrolled expect this kind of thing to go
on ? Martyrs, indeed ! The real martyrs are
the community, upon whom Parliament has
permitted a set of amiable nincompoops to foist
an ideal poor-house with unexampled possibili-
ties in the way of carraway-seed and cayenne
pepper. It isn’t wholly the fault of the men,
of course, that the Pitt Town failure is so
ghastly. But the sooner the country sets its
foot on the neck of the “simple, beautiful,
Arcadian system,” the sooner the men will
mend.
The Lav of Appeal.
A married lady-teacher recently sued Vic.
Education Department for six months’ salary,
in lieu of a “proper notice” to quit, and
obtained a verdict. The department fought
and lost this case on the recommendation of the
late Attorney-General. The present A.G.
advises an appeal to the Full Court, inasmuch
as the decision re one lady-teacher entitles a lot
more of them to claim salary, amounting to
some £2500 in all. Practically Attorney-General
Isaacs says : “ The Government of the State
has failed to obtain justice from its Supreme
Court, and we will carry our grievance to the
higher, or Full Court.” Anyway, that is how
the outside world must interpret the meaning
of the department’s appeal. Supposing the
higher Court confirms the other (humorously
called Supreme) Court’s decision, ignor-
ant Victorians will assume that their
Attorney-General is an unsatisfactory law-
yer, because he altogether misunderstood
the law. If the Full Court confirms the opinion
of Isaacs by upsetting the original judgment,
the Supreme Court will stand condemned by
the Law, in the public eye, as a worse than
useless institution. Every appeal case excites
anew the bitter cry of common sense—What is
Law, and where is Justice bred ? To which a
sophistical barrister replies that the Law is
known to no one, and Justice is a matter of
opinion. Judges are mere blind men groping
for Truth in a dense fog of learned precedents
and modern instances. The sophistical bar-
rister refers, of course, to civil argumenta-
tive law. Men are hanged, flogged and
imprisoned by criminal law, and the wigs
all argue that justice is being administered.
There are no appeals against the gallows, or
the cat. The Judge sums up in a prisoner’s
favor, or otherwise, and a jury, more often than
not, forms his Honor’s opinion into a verdict.
Criminal law Justice is largely bred in a Judge’s
skull, but as regards Justice in civil law’, we
have the ghastly fact that civil lawyers always
differ as to its birthplace, and never feel certain
that it has been born, or even conceived. Laws
are made, Acts of Parliament passedj bar-
risters argue over them, Judges come to
decisions upon those arguments, after all which
—an appeal to another court. And, although
finality in legal judgment be arrived at, the
sophistical barrister does not admit that justice
is necessarily there. For nobody knows the Law.
The game of appeals and costs is based on this
tricky argument. A shameful game, surely.
Selfish litigants bring their honestly warped
notions, or impudently absurd pretences of
right and wrong, fairness and unfairness, to a
law-court. Yet one or two judges are held in-
capable, by the law of appeal, of deciding what
is right and fair according to Law. For no
lawyer knows the Law. Laymen, let it be
carefully observed, don’t desire to have the
Law’s identity wrapped in this expensive robe
of mystery. They support, in Victoria, six
judges, and, considering that any six judges are
bound to be always contradicting one another,
and any one of them is likely to know as much
as another, the public would be glad to have
each Court’s decisions made final. Men box, or
row for big stakes, and the umpire awards the
money upon a foul. The finality of his judg-
ment has been determined by written agree-
ment beforehand. There is no appeal against
the opinion of the man at the little window
who thinks the Melbourne Cup was won by a
horse that, perchance, finished a nose behind
the “ second ” animal. If the Great Unknown
Law were honestly desirous of settling legal
contests in the most satisfactory way possible,
it would require suitors to sign a document
binding themselves to abide by the first Judge’s
judgment they could obtain. Also the Law
would give every Judge the power to make his
jury’s decision final, if he deemed it wise and
fair. In other words, the Law would elevate
its group of supreme officers to the same dignity
as is enjoyed by the trustworthy individual who
umpires at a prize-fight.
“The Czar,” it is cabled, “has partially
abolished the use of the knout, restricting its
application to the discretion of the country
Judges.” On the other hand, New South
Wales Legislative Council now seeks to revive
the local use oi the knout—restricting its appli-
cation to the discretion of town and country
magistrates—a strong percentage of whom are
ignorant and malicious savages, as often drunk
as sober. Even some of the police-magistrates,
in towns, actually sit on the bench while drunk,
and quite a number of them can’t pull their
boots on any morning until they have had about
six whiskies. However, that doesn’t much
matter, as no black-coated or well-connected
youth or man has ever been, or ever will be,
flogged. The lash for the workman —and his
sonT The House of the Glutton’s Snore will
no doubt pass the new flogging-bill with
alacrity, but let every democratic voter mark
well the name of every member of Assembly
who dares to vote for a law which involves the
flaying of “ common people ” without the inter-
vention of a sober Supreme Court Judge and
jury.
The Inspector-General of New South Wales
police, in his report for ’94, says that the
“Sunday-closing clause” of the Licensing Act
is “no better observed by licensees than in
previous years.” Let the boot be put on the
right foot. The licensees don’t observe the
clause simply because the public won’t observe
it. Isn’t it about time that a little common-
sense was imported into legislation, and that
laws that are absolutely repugnant to public
opinion should be repealed or at least re-
modelled ? The Inspector-General actually
declares in his report that it is found impractic-
able “ without neglecting other important
duties ” to employ a sufficient number of men
to enforce this law. Until the teetotallers can
make the public conscience believe that Sunday
beer is sinful as well as illegal, the public will
insist on buying and drinking its Sunday beer.
When the teetotallers do achieve that result
(in the Greek Kalends, of course), the public
will admit the sin also of week-day beer, and
will acquire teetotalism, gluttony and unchas-
tity as its trinity of strong points.
Sydney Truth sums up the reasons for not re-
engaging Commissioner Eddy at an increased
salary, with a holiday thrown in :
Lady Plagiary thus hits off the Eddy episode:—
“ Would I re-engage a cook at a rise in her salary, and
then allow her to go off to Paris (expenses paid) to learn
how to make some new dishes ? No, Sir Fretful, I would
not— and well you know it.” “ And well I no know it 1”
In other words, Eddy is only a sort of appren-
tice, and he has gone to Europe and America to
study his business at this country’s expense,
whereas what New South Wales wants is a
finished railway expert who knows all his
business already. Which wmuld be logical
if N.S.W. could find a railway expert who
knows everything in his own line that has been
invented up to date, and who also knows every-
thing that is going to be invented during his
life-time. But, unluckily, there is no such man
alive just now. Every year Europe and America
are turning out new labor-saving and money-
saving appliances for railway purposes, and if
the railway systems of Australia are to be kept
up-to-date one of three things must happen; (1)
Either a clever official must make a peri-
odical tour to inspect the latest discoveries,
and see them at work, and adopt those that are
worth adopting ; or (2) this country must pur-
chase all the new inventions indiscriminately,
and find out at its own cost whether they are
good or bad ; or (3) Truth must arrange that
all such new apparatus shall hereafter be
invented in Australia and nowhere else, so that
they will always be on the spot. As an exam-
ple, the Vic. Railway Commissioners recently
discovered that they could save yearly an
amount, variously stated at from £16,000 a year
to almost double that sum, by the use of a cheap
little machine which oils the engine automa-
tically, instead of having the refreshing fluid
poured on by hand. One small discovery like
that is worth four times Eddy’s salary, and it
is worth paying a man to travel round the
world in search of similar trifles.
When is New South Wales going to establish
an information bureau in connection with the
Lands Department ? Said bureau should con-
tain maps of every land district in the
province, with all the land available for
selection accurately and accurately marked
thereon. Similar maps shouid be avail-
able at important country towns such as
Newcastle, Goulburn, Albury, Bathurst, and
others, and, in addition, every country lands
office should have an accurate map of its
own district marked in the same fashion,
These should be kept always well up to
date, and any official whose map wasn’t
corrected and revised, up to within a
fortnight at the outside, should be promptly
and enthusiastically sacked. Also, the depart-
ment should be able to supply information
about roads, markets, population, soil, and
kindred subjects, and any official who didn’t
keep himself posted up in all necessary facts of
this kind should be either discharged or turned
into a policeman. At present, such informa-
tion can only be obtained from private agents
who charge a small fee of <£2o or so for
finding the applicant a 100 acre selection, and
whose business is mostly a ghastly compound of
roguery, swindle and misrepresentation.

G. (Sydney): You say that according to Bullbtin logic

last statement is that most wealth comes from income.
This paper supports both Land and Income tax. It never
said that land wasn't a source of wealth. Also, the par.
referred distinctly to wealth derived from the land, and
took no account of the immense value of land as standing-
room for humanity. The land on which London is built
has an enormous artificial value, but the wealth you get
from it in vegetable or mineral products is practically nil.

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of Careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by .skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the lie,Ring properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

My Dear Moorabinda—
Mayoress Lees’ “first Tuesday” at Sydney
Town Hall on sth inst. was not a supreme sort of
outbreak—it looked like a weird ceremony for
women only, since scarcely a man relieved the
weary waste of petticoats. It is significant that
the women follow men into smoking-rooms and
dare the most horrible mixed tobacoodors in
order to never let Adolphus give ’em the slip—yet
men (I mean real men, not tame cats) won’t brace
up to one small cup of afternoon-tea in order to
bask in the society of women. That’s another
point on which the sexes are not equal.
A change came o’er the spirit of the music at
Mrs. Lees’ At Home—Miss Lees performing
selections on the great organ with pleasant effect.
She is the second of Wiegand’s pupilesses who has
tackled the big instrument, and the result made
me think that a lady should always be laid on to
play for occasions when people want to talk.
Under the srnitings of Wiegand, the organ tyran-
nises over the tympanum, but beneath a woman’s
hand it only growls sotto-voce, like a departing
thunderstorm.
Mrs. Lees and her daughters wore albescent gar-
ments of simple make—most sensible wear for a
very hot day, and the Lenten season hadn’t en-
couraged a rush of sackcloth and ashes to the
figure on the part of the guests, who all suggested
in their attire that the wardrobe was almost
empty at home. Some of the new initial hat-pins
were on view. I can’t say I really like them.
People whose initials suggest the points of the
compass ought not to wear them, anyhow, unless
they want to look like weather-vanes. Fancy a
girl with a big “S ” on one side of her skull and
a huge “W” on the other! Nobody could help
watching her to see if the wind was changing.
These immutable “Thirty-second Wednesdays,”
and so forth, on the part of official women, to
which Mrs. Tom, Dick, and Harry make a point
of going, are very often used by people to keep
their friends off their carpet and to effect economy
of refreshments. I mean that Mrs. Blank im-
pressively invites a regular round robin of her
friends to meet her at Mrs. Official Personage’s
heterogeneous “At Home.” When there they
mass into a coterie, Mrs. Blank taking the lead,
and, after a chat, Mrs. Blank suggests an adjourn-
ment for tea, just as she would in her own house.
Calm, isn’t it ? The most they do to the hostess
of the afternoon is to simply pump-handle her on
entering, and they will dodge out of any side-door
to avoid formal farewells. Yet somebody asked
at the Sydney “Literary” Women’s Club, the
other day, “ What is a vulgar person ?”
The engagement is announced of Miss Garran
(the “Miss Wilmot ” of the B. and B. Co.) to Mr.
B. Harper, of Manly Beach.
Mr. Churchill Otton managed the complimen-
tary concert tendered to ’cellist Gerard Yollmer at
Sydney Y.M.C.A. last week. Herr Yollmer
means to make his camp in Sydney as a ’cello
tutor, and though I have not detected a burning
anxiety on anybody’s part to learn the large, loud
instrument, still I have no doubt mein Herr has
received due encouragement, or surely he would
never have joined the throng of musicians who
are like sands on the shore in Sydney. Nellie
Young, in blue brocade, kindly lent her creamy
voice to grace the occasion ; and Henri Stael,
Kowalski, and Mr. Sykes helped things to an
artistic conclusion. By the way, 1 was much
struck by a hat I saw at the concert. It was a
longish black hat, and out of the top of the high
crown burst a quantity of flaming flowers. This
ought to be called the chimney-a-fire effect.
Quite the latest London society craze is the New
Baths Club (to build it cost .£80,000), in which
Australia has some sort of an interest, since the
club is installed at the residence of the papa of one
of the imminent Lord Brassey’s aides-de-camp.
The subscription is altitudinous, and the rnembah-
ship select, don’t you know. The place contains
every sort of baths —Turkish, Russian, and all-in
addition to the ordinary conveniences of a first-
class club, and only 550 membahs, the very top-
cream of London, will disport in the baths —a
description of which reads like the last days of
Pompeii. In faot, anybody who laves in these
hallowed waters is socially baptised for evermore
(bar accidents). Being dipped in Jordan is nothing
to it.
There is a ladies’ day, too, when all the best
women (or those not too frescoed to stand the
ordeal) will disport like Naiads in the marble
baths, and scratch their names with diamond rings
on the sides thereof, and, taking it altogether, it
seems a pity that the New Baths Club didn t start
when “ Ouida” was at her palmiest, for the whole
\hing appears to be much in her vein. The idea
is a splendid one for this climate.
Maoriland had a vice regal sensation, last week,
when Lady Augusta Boyle slipped off a bareback
steed and fractured her leg at the ankle. It is, en
parenth&se, very clever of Lady “ Gussie ” to
break it at the respectable ankle. “ How is your
ankle?” is a permissible query from either sex —
whereas “How is your leg?” would never do.
Bare-back riding is a new vice-regal departure
in Australasia, and is a frolic that no tame young
lady ought to attempt. Certainly the bush-girl
rides as well on an empty chaff-bag as on the best
hogskin, but the tame-girl doesn’t bestride her un-
dressed steed bush-girl fashion—she humps her
knee over the gee’s wither as if it was a crutch,
and either tumbles clear over the off-side or slides
down the near. Unless a girl is prepared to have
a foot on either side, bare-back riding is to her a
sealed sport.
Mrs. Brough’s farewell ben., at Sydney Lyceum,
drew a flatteringly full house, and the baskets and
bouquets that went over the floats turned the stage
into a flower-show when Mrs. B. spoke her
valediction. By the way, one clothes-basket full
was posted near the front, and the donor’s card
with its pencilled sentiments was turned full on
the public, who read it through their opera-glasses.
It must be a creepy sensation to write a senti-
mental message with your name attached to an
actress, and sit by while hundreds of unsym-
pathetic people read it, too.
I liked Mrs. Brough’s farewell speech better
than the last one, which was too calmly succinct
to be convincing. After all, it is a very much
more real thing to say good-bye before going ’Ome
than to make second-class cm revoirs before pro-
ceeding on a professional tour round Australasia.
Mrs. Brough was artistically nervous in her
a lieux at the close of her nine years’ campaign on
the ’Stralian stage. I suppose practice makes
you perfect in farewell-speechifying as in every-
thing else. I thought Mr. Brough’s “spoken”
was a perfect gem in stage speeches-flimsy enough
when viewed in cold blood, but just the necessary,
airy bit of persiflage which cleared the atmosphere
of heroics. “I am an old friend of Mrs.
Brough’s,” he said, and everybody laughed.
In spite, though, of flowers and fuss, I do not
think the charming Mrs. Brough was so univer-
sally adored as she might have been had not
Mr. B. sternly (and very sensibly) decreed that
she must not recite even “ Casabianca ” for the
edification of small tea-parties, the givers of which
are generally prone to forget what a breach of
professional etiquette it is to ask artists to sing
for their suppers. Mrs. B. never performed gratis
(bar benefits, mind you), and the only time in nine
long years she ever gave the public a cheap show
(unless my memory plays me a trick) was last
Saturday, when she took a stall at a fair in aid of
a suburban Infants’Home (where one of the boy
babies is called “Robert,” after Mr. Brough, who
happened to be there when the bantling was dis-
covered on the mat), and dispensed useless bazaar
articles in the sacred cause of the “ foundlings.”
In another way, too, Mrs. Brough baffled the
local lioness-hunters, who yearned to make a sister
of her, and exhibit her in a tame state —she had no
“day ”at home; and so whole scurries of inquisi-
tive females, foolishly seeking to state their more-
or-less genuine admiration for the actress with
maudlin gushings over the woman, were blocked
at the very outset. But perhaps her complete
devotion to the stage is one of the reasons why
Mrs. Brough has reigned so long, and why she will
be received with open arms on her return. Pro-
fessionals who display their wares gratis in private
drawing-rooms, and submit to be pawed in the
way of friendship by patrons of the dress-circle,
haven’t always the longest artistic life.
Some of the “Masqueraders” (the new and
improper play at Sydney Lyceum) reminded me
of some parts of the “ Heavenly Twins ” set to
music, as it were, but I liked the new leading
woman (leading lady is obsolete), Geraldine Olliffe,
who is indeed as an oliffe—l mean olive—in the
theatrical bill-of-fare. I don’t consider Miss O. a
professional beauty, for, though she has an emo-
tional profile, she is hollow-cheeked, and the con-
tour of her face is square ; but she is tall and
willowy, and possessed of a magnetism far beyond
that of the common electric-shock, and—she
knows how to dress herself. In the first act —a
“pink” ball at a country inn —the first part is
played in a black gown with a frizzy coiffure d la
Hebe, made realistic by a red bow, and the second
part in a yellow evening frock of suburban cut,
from which the chiffon comes off, so that Mr.
Elwood (he talks like Alfred Dampier) may pin it
up and reverently kiss her garment meanwhile—
whereat a titter arose. The audience, largely
At the Tasmanian International Exhibi-
tion one of the prettiest sights is undoubtedly the
show-case containing the new excellent toilet
requisite, “ Atnykos,” which has of late got such
a popular name amongst the people of Aus-
tralia, and is getting a good hold of the Tas-
manians and their guests at the Exhibition.
This shows that this excellent preparation for
the skin, teeth and mouth is thoroughly appre-
ciated when once used. Sold' by all chemists, etc.,

consisting of the Chosen, evidently thought it a
good joke to kiss the hem of her garment when
the girl had her face with her, but they critically
and seriously applauded Cecil Ward’s auctioneer-
ing. The fall of the hammer touched a sym-
pathetic professional chord behind many a
dazzling shirt-front. The ball guests in the first
act were satisfactorily gowned—Grace Noble and
Emma Temple cutting stylish figures, but the
new “ old woman,” Miss Compton’s, frock sug-
gested a quantity of tea-leaves sticking on a white-
washed wall. Titheradge, in pink and a very
repulsive part, reminded me of Lord Carington in
the first act. I think Titheradge ought to have
been the hero.
In the second sob, Miss Olliffe sported a good-
looking dress of white-satin brocade, the train
lined with silk, and a folded bodice of pink and
huge white butterfly sleeves, a feather fan and a
stage-diamond necklace finishing off a very neat
toilette, which made the speechless portion of her
stage guests look more touzled than usual by con-
trast. Miss Bessie Tarrant (Miss Hammond)
looked crisp in a flesh-pink silk gown, but a semi-
amateur, who trailed in wearing a lavender dress
with what looked like a hearse-pall weirdly fes-
tooned at the back, was quite up to the sartorial
standard of the usual stage guest, and so was
another girl in a white, raggy sort of garment
with a bunch of scarlet flowers.
In the third act (after which the dressing
lets up) Miss Olliffe wore a shot-bean and reseda
silk with bodiceof puffed strawberry-colored chiffon
and a few effective patches of black passementerie.
Emma Temple and Grace Noble wore dominoes,
and the marvellously agile Dot Boucicault
cut a quaint figure as a Pagliacci, covering
his fool’s dress with a black cloak lined
with scarlet which he managed as deftly as a
skirt-dancer. “The Masqueraders” (which I
consider a wicked play, because in the end the
good man looks such a fool) contains a few
smart cynicisms. “Marriage is the last insult
a man offers to a woman he respects,” made several
d.c. matrons ruffle their feathers and call it a
horrid play.
I am not fascinated with Elwood, who reminds
me of a Sydney Q. 0., and who never seems to
forget his hat. For example, in the hotel-scene,
when he enters in a hot hurry to see his fate once
more, lie naturally flung his hat on to a chair, and,
as it slid off (properties always act as if possessed
on a first night), he most unnaturally stooped to
pick it up again. No matter how arduously a
man may act afterwards, a lover who is so con-
cerned about his boxer necessarily impresses you
with the idea that his hat is of more importance
to-him than the lady. If I were a he-actor I
wouldn’t like to go down to posterity as a man
with a perfect genius for bringing his hat out of
the most agonising situations without a dimple in
its crown.
Under the heading of a “grand wedding,” a
Northern paper gives a mile-long account of a
recent Sydney marriage when a wealthy Israelite
led his bride under the chuppah. In this report
every article in the bride’s trousseau is described
down to the very last goffer in a familiar way that
certainly goes one ahead of the common or garden
style of trousseau-reporting. It is unique, and
deserves to be reproduced if only to encourage the
“ society ” pen-woman to dive beneath the surface
in future.
After describing acres of silks, satins, cotton
and rags, the reporter (who is masculine and
married, I hope) takes a header. “The lingerie
is of the finest lawn and cambric richly trimmed
with Valenciennes and Torchon laces, veining, and
other delicate embroideries, all exquisitely marked
with a monogram of three letters, and the gar-
ments are in sets of three and also in combina-
tions (!). In the make the American fashion is
followed in many. The knickerbocker portion
of the combinations have finely-pleated frills
edged with lace. The frills are open on the outer
side, and ttiis arrangement takes away the pres-
sure of the seam and prevents the tearing that so
often results in the old style. The night-
dresses are so handsomely trimmed that with a
silk lining in front they would make perfect
blouse bodices. In the chemises, many have a
full cambric sleeve—a ball-gown sleeve in minia-
ture —set in to the band of insertion which forms
the shoulder-strap. The puff is about six inches
deep, and is edged with lace like that above the
insertion. The exquisite needlework, in addition
to the fine quality of the fabrics and trimming,
makes the underlinen very attractive.” Dress
reporting is indeed becoming “ thorough.” How
proud and happy the bridegroom must be, feeling
that the public know all about his bride’s “com-
binations,” and how neatly her nightgowns fit
her 1
Gov. Duff is now said to be suffering from
“lingering jaundice,” and the weirdest reports
float up from the tight little island. For one
thing, the Y.R. telegrams said, the other day,
that H.E. had not slept, and could eat nothing,
but still he was “progressing favorably!” A
patient who can neither eat nor sleep is not a very
promising convalescent. However, everyone hopes
for the best, and trusts that the Governor will
soon be restored to health.
I am pleased to hear that the tickets for ex-
Mayor Manning’s complimentary banquet are
having a hot sale, and that the affair promises to
bo a huge success. There is talk of giving ex-
Mayoress Manning a reception a la Mrs. Bowden-
Smith after the banquet, and this also is a good
idea, for the kindly lady certainly merits the
compliment. Ex-Mayor Manning goes ’Ome
shortly with Miss Manning for a business-cwm-
holiday tour.
Sydney has a good heap of wild, unearthly
melody in store for it. The Metropolitan Lieder-
tafel leads off with a glorified sing-song with
women’s voices for the first time, and assisted by
nine first-class artistes, including Miss Florence
Esdaile, Miss O’Shannessy, Kowalski, Strauss
and Arthur Deane (who will be a first-class artist
some day). The Sydney Liedertafel follows on
27th with one of its sure-to-be-good outbreaks,
assisted by a new Sydney soprano, Lottie Hyam,
Allpress and Arthur Deane. On 28th the Phil-
harmonic enters the lists with “ Samson,” assisted
by Mr. and Mrs. Philip Newbury, Mrs. “ Char-
ley ’’Edwards, Hallewell and Mr. Wildigg. The
long-haired are in for a regular treat.

Jones’ drama, “ The Masqueraders,” which
introduced the new Brough-Boucicault 00. at
Sydney Lyceum, is an unsatisfying affair, with
many good things in it, and many things which
are not bad, but are only rather slow. It ends no-
where in particular, chiefly because the author has
by that tune got it into such a state that it can’t
end anywhere else. The story covers four acts,
and can be told in as many sentences. A bright,
ambitious girl has been reduced to become a bar-
maid at a fashionable hotel, and, being loved by a
poor and dreamy man of science and a hog-like,
gilded baronet, she marries the baronet, as most
girls would. The baronet drinks away his fortune
all but 3s. 3d., his other assets being a daughter, a
blotched, full-moon countenance, a footballer’s ex-
pression, and a wife who is on the verge of insanity.
The dreamy astronomer becomes rich, and stakes
his pile against his old love and her child in a mid-
night game of cards, and wins. Then he takes
the stakes away to his home among the Alps, and
there the lady thinks better of it, and they part.
The dreamer, with his unsatisfied longing still upon
him, goes away to Africa, and no one knows what
becomes of him. The lady stays behind, and her
after-fate is a matter of conjecture. The baronet
is left insensible on the floor, with 3s. 3d. between
him and perdition, and the drama goes on and
leaves him. A dozen other characters come into
the story, but the drama goes on and leaves them
all. In which respect it resembles a hydrophobic
patient the writer once met, whose disease com-
pelled him to run, barking as he went, and who
caught hold of bushes as he ran to try to stop him-
self until someone would overtake him. But
every time he did it the bush was dragged out of
the ground, and at last he ran over the horizon
with his hands full of herbage, and left everybody
behind. Jones also runs and leaves all his
characters behind.
• • «
Jones’s drama is life-like and realistic
because it is an unfinished tale of misery, and this
world in general is miserable and unfinished.
Also, it contains one really artistic scene and one
patch of tragic intensity which should make the
fortune of a much worse production. It is never
altogether bad, and once it manages to be alto-
gether good, while on two or three occasions it
only escapes being excellent with great difficulty.
Miss Geraldine Olliffe, Mrs. Brough’s successor,
is an unalloyed success. She is tall, graceful, and
stately, with a bright, expressive face, a strong
musical voice, and a magnetic presence ; also, she
is a finished actress, and, as Jones’s heroine, she
is nearly half the drama. Most of the other half
is Titheradge. As the baronet with the foot-
baller’s expression Titheradge outshines even him-
self. The greater part of the time he is a slouchy,
sullen, sodden, leering ape, but in the scene where
he gambles for his wife and daughter and loses
them he is blotchy and rampant, and the
living picture of an ape in a state of crazy
excitement. Mr. Elwood, another new importa-
tion, makes a great hit in the same scene, but th-
rest of the time he is a stagey person with a stride
and a sombre drawl and a number of exhaustirm
attitudes. The Bulletin suspends its judgment
until it ascertains if the stride and the drawl
belong to Elwood or if he belongs to them, and
respectfully hopes for better things. Mr. Comp-
ton, a third new arrival, has a small part and
no definite opportunity, save the opportunity ol
letting the public know that he pronounces surely
as “shurley.” Miss Beryl Faber leaves a de-
cidedly good impression in a Quakerish part;
Miss Talbot—still another new attraction—does
sufficiently well in a very small character; and
Cecil Ward is a bright spot in Jones’ wilderness.
Providing Elwood doesn’t always stride ami
Compton doesn’t say “ shurley ” too regularly, the
new importations promise well on the whole.
Bjucicault, who engaged them after persomd
inspection, is a man of few histrionic mistakes.

The Lyceum dress-circle audience didn’t
talk half so much as usual on Saturday night, and
it now only converses about three times as much
as the d.c. at the Royal or Her Majesty’s. The
principal disturbance on Saturday was caused by
a female with the longest neck in Sydney, wl.i“
cackled incessaptly with the female with the
shortest neck in N.S.W., and by the stentorian
voices of two well-known newspaper men who
need to be killed and eaten.
** * *
Mrs. Brough’s farewell on Friday night was
as big a function as the Lyceum would hold. Tin-
departing favorite made her exit in “ Niobe,” ami
the Greek lady who haunted the house of Peter
Amos Dunn never appeared to more advantage
She also made a pretty little speech, which was
altogether successful, especially when she struggl- 11
with her rising tears towards the end, and began
to be troubled by the exuberance of the audience.
Brough also farewelled in a cheerful vein, amt
didn’t struggle with his tears, for he hadn’t any
about him. The senior member of the firm was
in a happy mood, and gladdened the audience with
the joyous assurance that he would return by-and
bye. About two tons of flowers were handed over
the footlights, and towards the end of the last act
the house of Dunn looked like a gorged conserva-
tory. “Niobe” lasted longer than usual because
the audience insisted on cheering in season and
out of season, and in various other places besides,
and altogether it was a great occasion.

duction looks as if it is quite capable of lasting out
the season. By the way, The Bulletin desires
to mention that Bland Holt has a birthday on
Sunday, on which date he is partly 24 years of
age and partly 115, or thereabouts. That is to
say he looks about 24, but, judging from the
amount of amusement he has furnished to the

Miss Florrio Ford had a benefit at Her
Majesty’s (Sydney) on Saturday, and thereafter
the theatre closed fpr a fortnight to give the lessee
a well-earned rest. It is so long since Mr. Rignold
&ad a rest that the date is lost among the mists of
time. Meanwhile, he proposes to toil vigorously
at the preparation of a new drama, that being the
only form of repose he indulges in; in other words,
he leaves off work and proceeds to carry bricks
uphill.

Edward Fordo, “the most remarkable
facial comedian of the age,” made his appearance
at Sydney Tivoli according to promise, and proved
as well up to description as could be reasonably
expected. That is to say he is a good comedian,
and, owing to his variety of expression, he can
pass’ as three or four comedians when necessary, and
if he could all appear on the stage simultaneously
he would fill a very long-felt want. Winton, the
ventriloquist, has fixed up some new and interest-
ing performances, and all the old members of the
co., including little Alma Grey, are doing well.
Also, the glad news is promulgated that comedian
Larry Dooley will be in evidence next Saturday.
The name of Dooley is probably intended as a
guarantee that the bearer is a comedian, it being
a tradition of the stage that all persons named
Dooley are more or less comic.

“M’lntyre’s Flirtation” put in a postponed
appearance at Melb. Princess’ last Friday. The
gloomiest anticipations were more than realised
by this ricketty dramatic offspring of “ Muldoon’s
Picnic.” However, as the poor little thine toddled
upon the stage of Messrs, W, and M.’s respected
theatre for one night only, and is not likely to re-
peat its indiscretion at any future time, The
Bulletin begs to move that the circumstance be
expunged from the brilliant records of the Prin-
oess’. Carried unanimously.
** * *
“ The New Boy ” made a cheerful start on
Saturday. The extreme simplicity of its story
distinguishes “The New Boy” from many other
farces, ancient and modern. Massive Miss Jenny
Watt-Tanner has a husband able to pass fairly
well for her 14-year-old son, and circumstances
force this beardless adult into the garments of
youth and the position of a pupil at boarding-
school. There he gets torn asunder on the foot-
ball field, and inhumanly buckled by Bullock
major. Also, he is rather worried by the endear-
ments of a forward little minx, whose license to
roam around the academy and mash at random is
not more improbable than the discretion of a
married man in declining her invitations to hug.
There are no hiding places, or ordinary complica-
tions, attached to the scene of this imposture, and
when the new boy confesses his 30 years, and his
fine, large figure of a wife has publicly claimed
him for her own, nothing else needs to be
straightened up. A red-haired schemer and a
sudden rise in the shares of a dry champagne
company are extraneous incidents.
# # •
The cast of characters for “ The New Boy”
was the same at the Princess’ as when the joke
was first played in Sydney. All the newcomers—
Messrs. Bernage, Alderson, Mayeur, Cosham,
Roberts, and Miss Housley—look their parts
satisfactorily, besides being more or less convincing
in other respects. Perhaps Ernest Cosham, as
Bullock major, acts a few years in advance of his
Eton jacket, and probably Dion Boucicault would
make a better principal boy than Ralph Roberts,
but the objections in both cases are negative.
Miss Watt-Tanner is a toiver of strength, and
Miss Housley succeeds in seeming even girlier
and sweeter than sweet sixteen. Also, the new
comic edition of Clifton Alderson is a refreshing
change from his former self, whom one remembers
as the heroic leading gent, of the ill-fated Laura
Villiers expedition. Indeed, it is hard to recog-
nise our old friend, the Duke of Guiseberry, in
Felix Roach.

A new set of Living Pictures comes after
the comedy. The trial of Mrs. Grundy is over
some of these pictures in the form of drapery
which ought not to be there. As regards Helen
of Troy, the muslin sacrifice to Mrs. G. is hung
upon an invisible line, or bunched upon a stick,
Helen places a portion of her figure behind
this screen in a deeply interesting manner.
Evidently there has been an accident with the
tableau lady’s fleshings. The screen is accepted
as a hasty managerial device for concealing the
extent of the damage.

“ Esther Sandraz ” retires from the Bijou
on Friday. The fine frenzy of Miss Roselle, and
the good work of comedian Elton are loudly

grovv less. But the stagey situations appear

Rj a yi® hitter flavor is complained of. On Saturday
the Dactes produce “ A Bunch of Violets,” one of
oydney Grundy’s most successful achievements.

Charles Erin Verner, once an Australian
native comic singer, who has learned to act in
foreign parts, appeared at Melbourne Royal on
Saturday night. Mr. Verner is now an Irish
comedian of the best brand. He has a breezy
bhoyish style in humorous scenes, and much quiet
toree at serious moments. His own version of
ohainus O’Brien ” is a very inferior melodrama,
concluding with an impossible gallows and a
ridiculous reprieve for the prisoner, but Charles E.
Verner wins respect all the time. If he will
appear m an Irish play from somebody else’s pen,
and abandon his habit of singing more than is
good for the audience, the new arrival may do a
. r,s c business at the Royal. Apart from Verner’s
clever performance some very tolerable Milesian
treachery and patriotic valor are wasted upon
ohainus O'Brien.”

AN APOLOGY.
This is NOT the Portrait of Miss MAY
GUMMAS.
This portrait was, in last week’s Bulletin,
erroneously printed as the portrait of the com-
plainant in the Sydney court-martial case.
Through an unfortunate mistake, which The
Bulletin greatly regrets, and for which it now
sincerely and unreservedly apologises, great annoy-
ance has been caused to Miss KATE CUM-
MINGS, a young and favorably-known Sydney
lady, by the publication of her portrait in the last
issue of this paper as that of “ MISS MAY
CUMMINS, complainant in the Sydney court-
martial case." The portrait was obtained in the
usual way, i.e., through an individual who devotes
himself to providing newspapers with photographs
for publication, and as the provider of that portrait
gave his assurance that he had himself seen the
lady at the court-martial, and as this alleged
portrait of “ Miss May Cummins” corresponded
with one previously published by another paper,
it was accepted and printed in good faith. The
Bulletin much regrets that it should have been
so deceived, and that pain should have been in-
flicted on Miss Kate Cummings, a lady in no
way connected with Miss May Cummins, or with
the court-martial proceedings before referred to.
The Wild-Cat Column .
When the Anglo-Australian Investment Finance
and Land Co., of Sydney, made its historic collapse, it
found itself curiously situated. The debenture-holders
(£350,000 worth of them) had the first call on the assets ;
the depositors had the second, and the shareholders the
third. As there weren’t enough assets to cover the
debentures, the depositors had no visible chance of get-
ting anything; as for the sharebo'ders, their case was
hopeless from the start. Then the depositors commenced
expensive law proceedings to upset the claims of the
debenture-holders, and. being defeated in the local courts,
they carried the case to the Privy Council, and the Privy
Council, after chewing it over for six or eight months,
has decided in favor of the debenture-holders, and ordered
the miserable depositors to pay a very robust bill of costs.
• • * ♦
The Union Bank of Australia has earned about
£44,700 during the past half-year, and pays a 6 per cent,
div., absorbing £45,000. The result is attributed partly
to the general falling off in profits, and partly to the
large suras written off to provide for bad and doubtful
debts. No one has ever suspected the Union’s solidity,
yet its £25 shares, which sold a few years ago at nearly
£BO, can now be had for £29.
♦ * * »
The old, old story. The Australian Deposit and
Mortgage Bank, which reconstructed some time ago in
the usual enthusiastic fashion, reports that “ it is impera-
tive that steps should be taken to reduce the rate of in-
terest payable to depositors and debenture-holders.”
The reason is that £730,000 of the bank’s advances .are at
present bearing no interest. And just here the same old
question naturally arises: If this £730,000 pays no interest
what chance is there of getting back the principal? A'd
if the principal, or a good part of it, should prove irre-
coverable, where will the depositors, &c., ultimately coma
in?
♦ ♦ ♦ *
In another big impending “stave-off,” The
Bulletin sorrowfully notes that one institution is “in”
£12,000 and another (a very careful concern) £35,000.
Neither has any security save bills of the stave-off con-
cern’s eus tomers. A man who can get discounting
facilities appears to have no need of actual capital in
some provinces. The trader who at first discounts only
his “ sweet ” paper, can in time get anything melted, and
the tons of accommodation stuff are never distinguished
until either a bolt is made or the inevitable meeting of
creditors comes around.

In Sept, last a big liquor-house joyfully an-
nounced to one of its creditors who “ had his doots ” that
its (the b.l.h.'s) balance-sheet showed £50,000 surplus. In
Dee. the house whooped wildly to other creditors that
its surplus was £25,000. At a select meeting of the
creditors the other day it showed a surplus of but
£14,000 ! Provided all these statements were correct,
what a frightful illustration it is of the rapid depreciation
in value of trade assets ! The assets, by the way, consist
of stock, about £13,000 ; bills, £5000; cash, £600; and
book-debts, £45,000. Good old book-debts and bills!
Poor old cash ! Nearly as bad as a boom balance-sheet.

N.S.W. Justice Manning has decided that a
man is insolvent on the day he cannot meet, out of his
own money, all the legitimate claims against him. How
many commercial men are, in these days of paper, solvent
in that sense? Also, Justice Manning is one of the
influential people who, a year or so ago, held that certain
N.S.W. hanks “ were perfectly solvent if only they were
given a little time.”

A highly “ aristocratic ” firm of Melbourne
jewellers has been dropped on for a £3OOO fine
for defrauding the Customs (the Argus calls it
“evasion of duty”). The proprietor is very wealthy and
can afford to pay the fine 20 times over. Another big dis-
tributing jewellery house was dealt with only the other
day for smuggling dutiable jewellery in concertinas. Tub
Bulletin has already na< rated the swindle where 18-carat
gold chains were imported as brass-lamp pendants. There
are also three wholesale jewellery houses in Melbourne
and one in Adelaide which have made fortunes
at the game. Those which si ill continue operations
should cherish all "intelligent” employes, irespective of
their capacity, inasmuch as every expose of Customs eva-
sions so far has been made by' discharged employes. As
a matter of fact, the Customs cannot “follow” smuggled
jewellery unless “put up” to it. The very'compactness
of the article renders its smuggling easy, and no one but
an who knows the inner workings of his firm, can
afford sufficient evidence to the Customs to put the smug-
glers away.

Further economies at Block 14 (8.H.). Man-

way for the next in command. The manager of Block 14

important individual in the service of the mine. Zeb.
Lane used to be his own metallurgist.
The slimes from Block 10 concentrators are un-

First meeting of Londonderry shareholders a
howling success. Chairman North said the public took
over 400,000 shares, and letters of regret had been sent to
subscribers of over 11,000. It then developed into a love-
feast. Lou. Aarons, late of Sydney, said he had seen
the mine and subscribed 3000 shares—but whether he
mentioned that his brother had been appointed mining-
manager does not appear. Lord Fingall gave some assay-
ing figures all based on “if,” and one Gorrie said his
friend Shaw said he could get out three to five tons of
gold in eight to ten weeks. The Bulletin would like to
add its little opinion. The Londonderry is a phenomenal
surface-show—perhaps the richest ever seen, but whether
it will pay one div. or twenty on a capital of £700,0C0
no man knoweth. The chances are the shareholders
will never get their money back. The chairman also
announced that the vendors had acquired seven adjoir ing
leases, and would amalgamate them with the big mine
without any charge on the shareholders, and with visions
of “pups” the shareholders’ gratification was great.

Capitalists looking for mines and mostly
getting only leases—are daily arriving at Coolgardie.
They all come from, or are going to, London, where the
nuts are, and nine-tenths of them are sure to find mines
as long as the market holds out. The present game is to
throw cold water on the early floats and floaters. Some
excuse must be found, now that the batteries are going
up, and to hold the market these men and mines must be
passed out. One brilliant mining authority says: “I
believe London has of late been getting some of the best
Westralian properties just as at the beginning (hey got
all the worst.” Where and what are they ? London gets
no properties that are good at 'the price. It is next to
impossible to get a div. mine in W.A., because a shew
which would be worth £lO,OOO in Vic., where there is
plenty of water and cheap mining, would bring three
times the money in W.A., where there is neither—for the
boom is there.

Bayley’a battery stopped one boiler - plate

to go wrong by selling at the present price—between 9s.
and 10s. The newspaper guides of the poor, deluded
London public are asking why they don’t crush from the
4000-ton heap at grass. A few more weeks and it may
begin ro dawn on the public what the writer and others
thought, a year ago—that the big heap won’t go sdwt. to
the ton.

The 25 Mile sensation owes its boom to a certain
councillor, who came into Coolgardie ahead of the dis-
covery and said, “It eclipses the Londonderry.” Then
many remembered that it was the same gentleman who
enthused over the Wealth of Nations. However, he spoke
about a golden outcrop and heavy pieces of dazzling
metal for 30ft., but refused to open a box of specimens
till the prospectors arrived. A capable, coolheaied
manager, who saw them, says; “They weigh about
lOOlbs., and may contain 16 to 20oz. gold.” He adds:
“This show can be got for a mere £290,000 £lO,OOO
deposit and the balance to be paid as soon as the money
can be got together.” He also says several other things.

Mr. W. Merton, watchmaker, Sydney, late of
Hill End, in conjunction with Hr. Wiston Baker, Hill
End, has invented a new and simple self-opening tin, the
“Pull-wire.” A slight corrugation is made around the
top of the tin’s rim ; one end of a piece of thin steel-wire
is soldered in the corrugation, wound around the top of
the tin in the corrugation (the bed of the wire) to within
a Jin. of the other end, and is then passed through a
small hole in the top rim of the lid, and formed into a
loop. The lid is soldered on, and the hole through which
the wire passes hermetically sealed. To open the tin, you
hang the loop on a nail (or pass over anything, such
as a knife-handle, which will give you a grip) and pull
gently. The wire cuts the top of the lid almost off,
leaving only half-an-inch to act as a hinge ; but does not
leave any jagged edges whatever, and the whole contents
of the tin—whether meat, fish; jams or jellies—can be
emptied out in a solid form. The invention has been
syndicated in 2800 shares, and patented in 22 countries.
It is expected to prove a good thing.

have had enough whisky in to fight. No h : z., no whisky,
no fight.

FOR PROOF READ THIS:—
Mr. Chas. Friar, Nelson, N.Z., who writes on
May 15tb, 1893 : —I am much pleased to bear testi-
mony to the value of Clements Tonic. For seven
years I suffered from chronic dyspepsia, and con-
sulted many doctors, and took gallons of different
medicines, none of which did me the slightest
good. Every meal I took used to cause me great
inward pain, and invariably I used to throw it up
again. At length I had to take all my meals per-
fectly dry, and in a recumbent position, but with-
out benefit. Accidentally I got hold of one of
Clements Tonic pamphlets, and after reading its
contents I resolved to try the medicine. After
taking the first bottle I could take my food with-
out lying down, and three bottles cured me en-
tirely. I can now take my food solid and liquid
together, without the slightest after pain or ten-
dency to throw it up. I feel perfectly well and
have gained considerable flesh, whereas when the
complaint was on me I was as thin as a skeleton.
My age is 42, and present weight eleven stone four
pounds. I shall consider it my duty to recom-
mend Clements Tonic to all who suffer as I have
done, —Chas, Friar, Nelson, N.Z.

An old and prosperous Hunter River
pioneer and cattle-breeder, John Nowlan, of

A hanker, lately released from a N.S. W.

Lindsay Cooper, night-overseer of S.A.

Ash, M.P. (S.A.) does not save all his

10s.
Ferdinand von Mueller—who attributes
bis healthy old age principally to his going so

“The player plays many parts.” Jacob
Garrard, of N.S.W., wharf-laborer, blacksmith,
engineer, book-keeper, land-agent, auctioneer,
M.L.A., Minister for Education, and Minister

and is still going strong.
The proposed Land and Income tax has
produced quite a scare amongst the N.S.W. brigade
in London, and there will shortly be a large exodus
to Sydney (writes The Bulletin’s correspondent),
including Tanglefoot Tooth, Fitzwilliara Went-

J. W. Hackett, M.L.C., editor and part-
proprietor of West Australian, used to be a
thorn in the flesh of Dr. Madden (now Vic. Chief
Justice), with whom he closely contested Port
Melbourne on several occasions. Hackett is now
one of the strong men in W.A.’s political life.
Henry Frencham, of Richmond (Vic.),
who claims to have been the first discoverer of
gold at Bendigo in Nov., ’5l, revisited the old spot
last week. Since the first find -£70,000,000 worth
of gold has been taken from the field. Mr.
Frencham is 79 years of age and has 50 grand-
children.
Julian Salomons, Q.C., father of the N.S.
W;desßar, appeared at the Banco Court table one
day last week attired in a loud tourist suit. He did
not “move” anything; but Darley, 0.-J., kept
his weather eye upon the indomitable one, who
presently dropped the Chief a three-cornered note
and left the Court.
Oscar Wilde is proceeding against the
“ Markis ” of Queensberry for criminal libel. Pro-
bably the nobleman has accused Oscar of some
conventionality. Mister Wilde would have been
satisfied to revenge himself with an epigram, were
he capable of evolving one quite as telling as
Queensberry’s uppercut.
To Alexander Kethel, one of the vice-
presidents of N.S. VV. Highland Society, is due
whatever credit may attach to a ph\y of words on
“Scots wha’ hae.” At one of the society’s

he asked his friends to drink the health of “Scots
wha’ hae, and Scots wha’ dinna hae !”
Are atque vale! The N.S.W. Bar pro-

Simpson and speed retiring Mr. Justice Foster at

wisely enjoys the good things of this life.
Young Fred. Lange, who has figured so
prominently in the Vic. “society” libel-case —it
is a “ society ” case, for his pa left <£loo,ooo to the
family—during the last week or two, is a pale,
well-groomed youth, with a pink-and-white com-
plexion, and a tiny flaxen moustache. He sits in
a back row of the ceurt all the time and amuses
himself by wrinkling his forehead and tearing up
bits of paper. Mrs. Lange has not been in court.
She has been kept away for fear of being excited.
The defendant, Dr. Bage, is one of the examiners
in medicine at Melb. University,
“ General” Booth,
in the last English
census papers, described
himself as “a servant
of the Lord 1 .” A
“general” servant, as
it were.
The late Dean
England, of Melb., used
to tell how, when he
first became pastor of
Collingwood, he found
lamps at the four
corners of two inter-
secting streets, while
the neighborhood of the
adjacent convent was
“ all in the dark, like a
Protestant bishop.” He
asked Mick Molowney,
who kept the Retreat
Hotel, what was the
reason of this anomaly.
“Well, you see, yer
riverince,” says 'Mick,
“Ned O’Shea, the clerk
o’ the coort, lived on
that corner years ago;
and ould Bennett, the
town-clerk, lived over
there ; and constable
Fogarty owned the
house on that other
corner ; and Misther
Noone, when he was
Mayor, hung out ap-
point.”
Hercules Robinson, now spoken of as the
next Governor of the Cape, was accustomed in
Sydney to refer to his minute on the release of
bushranger Gardiner, sentenced to 32 years’ im-
prisonment, as his ablest performance.while N.S.
Wales Governor. The “ performance ” nearly
broke the back of Responsible Government.
Lord Brassey owns 26,000 acres of Wes-
tralian land, which, he says, he bought for
“purely philanthropic purposes,” intending to
establish a pauper colony in Westralia with
“ General ” Booth. The philanthropic idea did
not come off, and Brassey’s land is now worth
double its cost price. Virtue is its own reward.
The opulent Capt. “Matt.” Byrnes,
drowned last week at Pyrmont wharf, Sydney,
always had the honorary privilege of bringing up
the*Beautiful Harbor in one of his small fleet of
ferry-boats the prelates of the R.C. Church who
arrived by mail steamers. He so piloted Arch-
bishop Vaughan on his arrival, and, later on,
Card. Moran and Bishop Higgins.
Ib is related of the late Detective Elliott,
the best-known practitioner of his day in N.S.W,,
that he abhorred divorce oases and never volun-
tarily engaged in them. Once an old client, whom
he could not refuse, employed him to “shepherd’
his wife. Elliott accepted the commission, but he
waited upon and warned and advised the lady,
and in the end the couple lived happily.
A prince who lately visited Australia was,
at his own request, shown over the works of a
certain private 00., and recognised the intelligence
and civility of the senior workman, who acted as
guide in the absence of the manager, by present-
ing him with—a threepenny piece. The coin has
since been put in a suitable plush frame, and
adorns a conspicuous place on the office wall.
When it was announced the other day that
the wife of Mr. Ninian Melville, of Sydney, had
presented that gentleman with triplets, everyone
assumed that the victim was Ninian Melville, ex-
Chainnan of Committees of N.S.W. Assembly,
who lately lost his billet. “ And Satan finds
some mischief still for idle hands to do,’’remarked
the populace. But it wasn’t that Ninian Melville,
Mr. Freeman Thomas, Brassey’s son-in-
law, who is coming out to Melbourne as an
A.D.0., is, like his father-in-law, the son of a
wealthy contractor. Freeman Thomas, pere, was
a publican on a mammoth scale. He catered for
the Covent Garden Promenade Concerts, kept
hotels, and made money “ hand over fist ” in Lon-
don. His connection with Brassey is another link
between the beerage and the peerage.
Dr. Bleasdale, the English R.C. priest,
who was a great expert in wine and precious
stones, also in executions, having for years
escorted to the scaffold all R.C.’s hanged in Mel-
bourne, once said to a servant-woman, at Arch-
bishop Goold’s palace, “That’s always the way
with you Irish ; you can’t give a straightforward
answer to a direct question.” “ Phaw,” says the
Bridget, “ye never axed an Oirish gerrul to
marry yon or ye’d know the difference.”
A little hit* of verse written by Parkes 61
years ago when a Birmingham stripling, and lately
cited as a prevision of his present political condi-
tion :
A more dispiriting “wold” than the old man’s
present political one would be hard to discover.
At St. Jude’s, Randw.ick, are now buried
three recent N.S.W. Judges —James Martin,
Alfred Stephen, and W. M. Manning, In the old
Sand Hills lie three old-time N.S.W. Judges—
Francis Forbes, James Dowling, and John
Stephen. In the cemetery at Liverpool (N.S.W.),
where the major portion of the interments are
“ pauper,” are the remains of poor old deaf Judge
Kinchela, an ancient and unsuccessful member of
the Irish Bar who was given the N.S.W. Solicitor-
PRACTICAL.
SUNDAY-SCHOOL TEACHER (in a sheep-district) : “ Why did the

COCKY’S SON (with eager confidence) : “ Please, Miss, ’cause it was
the prize ram. ”
Generalship in the days of the “System”—when
anything was good enough for “the colonies.”
Re Chief-Justice Madden’s alleged remarks
about the poorness of the Vic. bar, “What about
the Supreme Court bench ? ” asks a BULLETIN
correspondent. “ Holroyd is the only first-class
man there, though Hood is good. Hodges looks
very sharp and isn’t; A’Beckett always reserves
his decision, and is apparently not equal to taking
reliable notes ; Williams would be a good man if
he could, but is lazy : while Madden is still an
advocate and very weak in his digest of facts;
The Supreme Court bench does not exhibit the
power of putting aside its class prejudices, but
somehow always appears to view the working
classes with a stern aspect compared to the suavity
exhibited towards the highly respectable and
moneyed. As for future Judges, Higgins, Topp
(if he abjured certain little eccentricities), and
Isaacs would be equal to any of the present bench
except Holroyd.”
The Rev. Dr. Momerie, the heretical
theological professor from London, who has been
globe-trotting through amused those
who met him by his dandified ways. He wears
dainty black silk socks, with white embroidered
clocks, and patent-leather shoes at least two sizes
too small for him ; clothes of the most elegant
cut, and a moustache trimmed as carefully as that
of the veriest dude. The philosophical conversa-
tion which some of those who met him
expected was not forthcoming. He jabbered only
the flimsiest small talk —cheap nothings—in the
simpering manner of a debutante in her first
season. He is so careful of his precious self
that he wears a muffler and a gresit-coat on even
the hottest days.
During the good old “stone-walling”
period of N.S.W. Parliamentary history, while
an attempt was being made by the virtuous Oppo-
sition of the day to delay a design of its enemy,
the corrupt and despicable Government, poor
Harold Stephen, in a stone-walling speech, was
called to order for describing someone as a “devil.”
Harold proceeded coolly to argue the matter on a
point of order, and went into the whole history of
the Devil, his private and public character, his
origin and probable final end, his habits, appear-
ance and general manners, his rise, decline and
fall, his influence, moral, political and ecclesias-
tical, the legends concerning him ; also the popu-
lar misconceptions about him. He vindicated him
in an elaborate disquisition, and then proved con-
clusively that there never was such a thing as a
Devil, nor did he ever possess the attributes alleged
concerning him ; but in case he ever had existed,
the spotlessness and blamelessness of his character
were clearly shown. After rambling on with
immense erudition, touching lightly for an hour or
so by the way on the Faust version, both Goethe’s
and Marlowe’s, Harold Stephen sat down, and
was immediately ruled out of order.
The late Capt. Darby, of the Orient liner
Ormuz, who, to the great regret of many afloat
and ashore, lately died at sea, aged 38 years, was
a man who lived for his ship ; he had no sports, no
hobby ; the ship’s welfare was the be-all and end-
all of his existence. Like Captain Tuke, of the
Austral, he was an old “Worcester” boy. This
training-ship Worcester is still lying in the
Thames, and still trains most of the midshipmen
for the English mercantile service; Oapt. Darby
was a 13-year-old boy when he joined her. He
first went to sea in ’BO, in the Lord Warden, one
of the old line of Blackwall sailing ships, which
began running to Melbourne in ’4B, so that from
the commencement of his career Captain Darby
was identified with the Australian trade. In ’BO
he became chief officer of the Renown, a ship
of the same service, and in ’Bl joined tin*
Lusitania, of the Orient line, taking the post of
fourth officer, the highest position assigned by
this company to officers coming frqm another
service. He rose to be second officer of the Cuzco,
then chief-officer of the Austral, and in ’9O com-
mander of the Chimborazo. His first trip as
commander was on a yachting cruise to Norway.
He was given command of the Orient in ’9l, but
in ’92 he had SO bad an attack of influenza that he
was prostrated awhile, and when well again took
the Chimborazo for another yachting trip. Re-
turning, he was appointed commander of the
Ormuz, and died on his second voyage from the
effects of a fresh attack of influenza. His wife
died 12 months ago last January, after a short
four years of wedded life.
Saturday Review on Gladstone : “ Poet
he might have been had his emotions been deeper
and his intellect larger : Primate he should have
been : Premier he was.”
Marital infidelity, murder and misdirected
suspicion, are fictional “properties ” so well worn
as to require rather more delicate handling than
they receive in “ Mortgaged Years,” the work —
under the pseudonym of “R. K. Dee of Mr.
O’Hara Wood, of the Victorian Bar. The book,
in fact, is less a performance than a promise, for,
though its general lines of construction are not
much less conventional than its materials,
there is an ingenuity about some of the in-
cidental developments which should make the
author heard of again to greater advantage.
Extremely well-conceived, for instance, is the
device by which the self-suspected Marston
is made to enlighten about hit enlightenment the
frisky dame whose negleet of the Seventh Com-
mandment is the root of all the evil. The situa-
tions, also, are, upon the whole, stronger than the
style, which is, in spots, not very dimly suggestive
of the London Journal. This fault, however, will
probably disappear with practice, and may fairly
have set against it certain touches of imagination
and pathos which take the book well out of tin
category of the commonplace.
A needy and benighted man,
Of woe-bent form and visage wan,
Attracted by a trembling ray
Which seemed at times to die away,
And sad as suffering wretch who sighs
Because none share his miseries,
Wandered across the gloomy wold
To find a shelter from the cold.

The advisableness of appointing future

At Richmond (Melb.)
police-court, last week, an
illicit-distiller, evidently in a
large way of business, was

dungeon cell. Meanwhile, the
local pub. keepers, who, pre-
s imably, bought the poison as
fast as it w is made, are neither
i nad nor imprisoned. Under
tha State Drink Department
system, illicit stills would dis-
appear, for the raw-spiritists
would have to consume their
own products if they wanted
to place the stuff anywhere,
ar,d death would result.
The utter impossibility of
telling how a new Act will
work is shown by a Maori-
lind return, which states that,
in the 23 years of provincial
Parliaments (1853-76), 2323
Acts were passed, of which all
bub 105 had to be repealed.
Under the present Parlia-
mentary system (1876-94), 2972
Aobs have been put on the
statute-book, and already 1602
have been repealed. Yet the
first idea of the average poli-
tician is that it is the chief
duty of Parliament to make
laws, more laws, keep on
making laws, though, more
often than not, the law is un-
necessary-even harmful; and
it generally is far easier to
pass a bad law than to repeal
it.
The attempt to make a

once he went away on a long
jaunt, leaving old Jack Robert-
son to run his Assembly elec-
tion. Everything went all
right, until some fool of a
voter arose and asked “old
Jack ” whether Mr. Want was
a Freetrader or a Protectionist.
“ How the devil should I

“why, the blanky man’s

In his first fortnight of offi.ee Premier Reid,
girding at Parkes and Garrett, and Dibbs and
Kidd, declared that he despised a Premier who
allowed a Minister to bring in a bill which the
head of the Government would not father. Last
week he promised the local optionists that next
session, if one of his Ministers liked to take up
their bill, he would provide an opportunity for its
discussion.
Tozer, at Stanthorpe, avowed recently that
Boodlewraith is wedded to the present system
of education. T. J. Byrnes thinks otherwise.
The Yellow Pup, however, which has rendered
invaluable services to Tozer and Barlow, must be
placated. He was beginning to howl ominously.

Said H. Parkes in ’92 : “I have arrived at
the conclusion that Parliament is a very unfit body
to deal with the question of Federation.” Yet,
the moment the Premiers’ Conference proposes to
refer the question to a people’s convention, H.
Parkes dubs the scheme “preposterous!” Vivat
H. Parkes !
In the Morris v. Syme case plaintiff stated
that he did not consider it incongruous for a man
not holding a vote in an electorate to endeavor to
represent that electorate in Parliament. Why
should it be so, seeing that though a conviction for
crime deprives a voter of his franchise, it doesn’t
debar him from standing for a constituency ?
The Board of Health at York (W.A.) has
issued a notice that the local water-supply “is
quite unfit for use unless boiled.” It might have
gone a little further, and stated that all Westralia
—including its Government—is unfit for use un-
less boiled. The Government probably wants to
be boiled more than any other part of the concern.
Was the incitement to murder, alleged
against anarchist Andrews, equally widespread,
grave, or persuasive with the incitement to
assassinate the late Czar, promulgated by poet
Swinburne? Yet English law overlooked the
latter, and the House of Commons declined to
interfere, whereas, in Sydney, law and order tried
and sentenced Andrews.

many Australian churches afloat.
One great reason for the very bad defeat
which Dibbs sustained on his motion of censure
was his refusal to back the O’Sullivan party in
condemning the re-appointment of Commissioner
Eddy. O Sullivan tacked on this condemnation
as an amendment to the original motion, and if

MR. OLDUN : “ And how are you progressing in your studies
at the Shrine of Art, Miss New-Woman? Have
you been doing any work lately ? ”
MISS NEW-WOMAN: “I am only at present engaged in illu-

female bricklayer; but next week I hope to design
something divided ’for the banner of the Woman-
Suffragists with the inscription, ‘ Womanhood pants

Dibbs had accepted it he would have scooped in a
g'ood many votes. Bu‘t the lengthy politician has
a conscience of a certain rough and ready kind,

trade book, Hirsch prints at large two letters from
Fleming to himself re the enormities of Protection
on the boot-trade. Fleming has crossed out
Plutocrat from his black-book and written in Pro-
tection. In the old partnership Fleming supplied
the enthusiasm and Flynn the brains. Flynn still
has the brains.
Melb. Board of Works lately sent to Eng-
land a large order for cement —which could have
been supplied locally at an equally cheap rate.
The duty came to .£20,000, and the Aegus heads
its article —in which it points to the transaction
as a horrible example of the evils of Protection—
with the words, “.£20,000 thrown away.” The
Aegus evidently thinks that the money received
for Customs duties is put in an iron box and cast
into the deep, damp sea. The fact that the
.£20,000 was paid by the people to the Govern-
ment, and was used by the Government for the
benefit of the people, and that, if it hadn’t been
paid by the people in this way, it would have had
to be paid in some other way, will probably be
quite new and surprising information to the
Aegus.
“Sweet Marie,” the song which has
become so popular all through the colonies, has
just been issued by Messrs. W. H. Glen & Co., of
Melbourne, in No. 28 of their well-known musical
annual, entitled the Colonial Musical Cabinet,
which is certainly a marvellous shilling’s-worth of
music, as, in addition to “Sweet Marie,” the
book contains no fewer than 14 other popular
songs, complete with words and music, including
“ Because I Love Thee So,’’ “ She Wore a Wreath
of Roses,” “Mottoes Framed Upon the Wall,”
“ Simon the Cellarer,” “Blind Girl to Her Harp,”
and “ Where’er You Walk.”
Frank Harley Davis developed his early
symptoms of brain and muscle at Toowoomba (Q.),
where his father has long-time presided over the
Highfields State school. At 10 years of age the
boy asserted his independence by joining the
shearing camp at Jondaryan Station, on the
Darling Downs, as “ picker-up ”of fleeces. Later,
he became a pupil-teacher under his father, but,
finding the scholastic atmosphere uncongenial, he
elected to become a professional shearer at the age
of 19. Five years later he was known through-
out Australia as one of the fastest wool-gatherers
on record —the “ringer’’ of the majority of the
sheds of the Barcoo, Diamantiria, Culf, and W.Q.
squattages. On one test occasion, at Lome, he
shore 400 full-fleeced sheep in two days of Bhrs.
20mins. each. At Isis Downs he shore 200 sheep
in hours; and, during the season of ’B3, he
shore 24,500 sheep, an almost incredible
record, seeing that the average shearer’s tally
is 90 per day! Owing to failing health
Davis dropped shearing after a while and
accepted service with John Falconer, a mining
expert and engineer, then employed by the old
railway department. The boss encouraged his
young employe’s natural taste for mechanics. It
was then that Frank Davis conceived the idea of
the Calyx drill, which, after long experiment,
was perfected in ’93. While exhibiting his drill
at Brisbane Exhibition in ’9O, the subject of this
notice saw the Wolseley sheep-shearing machine
at work, operated with it on a single sheep, and
thought he could go one better. Three years
later, in pursuance of this notion, he shore through
twosheds with the Wolseley,and at the second shed
made his improved implement at the station smithy
out of old cross-cut saws and other waste metal.
Experts now freely admit that the Davis sheep-
shearing machine (which will be driven by elec-
tricity) takes a tremendous stride in advance of
all previous inventions of the kind. Both patents
will be introduced to the industrial world by their
inventor. “At a modest computation,’’Davis ex-
pects to net .£200,000 from the Calyx drill within
14 years (the Vic. Government has already paid
.£2500 for the privilege of using five drills), and
the sheep-shearing machine is expected to earn a
big revenue for the proprietary company now
being formed in Melbourne for its manufacture
and sale. Frank Davis is an ardent Democrat,
and possesses the natural force and magnetism
which go to make leaders of men. In the old
days he exercised great influence among the
Queensland shearers, and might easily have dam-
aged his future by becoming a member of Parlia-
ment. The late Francis Adams met Davis in the
banana country, and a great friendship sprang up
between them. From the brainy “ ringer ” Adams
gained much of that insight into the toil and
hardships of the workers of the West, which he
frequently turned to account in his wiitings.
Bryari O’Loghlen has the magnificent
assurance to offer himself for the vacant Carlton
(Melik) seat in Vic. Assembly. If there is a
strong Irish, vote tb bid for in the late W.
levers’ constituency the Labor-party w.ill do well
to run a son of Erin in direct opposition to the
ftpUe prosequi financier. If the nationality ques-
t>on is not of great importance any other sort of
suitable candidate may be expected to “do"
Bryan badly at Carl tod.
N. S. W. politics
afford a dreary spec-
tacle of disloyalty to
party leaders. The
Freetrade party is en’
gaged shaking off
Parkes, the Protection-
ist party Dibbs, and the
Labor party Cook.
Current R.C. ana-
themas against mixed
marriages, and so on,
recall an example of
the vanity of modern
clerical curses. At the
M.L. general election
13 candidates went up
for three Christchurch
seats. In reply co a
circular three of these
expressed their willing-
ness to vote for a sub-
sidy for Catholic
schools, and, at a mass
meeting of Catholics,
Bishop Grimes told
Catholic voters to sup-
port these three. But
they didn’t, for it is
tolerably certain that
most of the R.C.’s
being more or less in-
terested in the liquor-
traffic, worked and
voted for W. W. Col-
Hns, freethought lec-
turer, uncompromising
opponent of prohibition
(although himself a
total abstainer), and
still more uncompro-
misingly averse to any-
thing but “free, secular
and compulsory” edu-
cation in Maori land.
The first murder of a white man since the
Tongans were converted to Christianity 50 years
ago, happened on last New Year’s eve, says The
Bulletin’s correspondent, when a young car-
penter, Low, a Maorilander, who had only been
about a year living at Lifuka, Haabai, was killed
by a native, Siale Vani, a grandson of Pita Vi.
Pita *Vi was one of the first converts to Christi-
anity, and the first Wesleyan native ordained
minister in the Tongan Group. For years he was
chaplain to old King George Tubou I.

New Japanese discovery of “ Taka-koj ”

than smashing China up, if true.

then demanded “ Another penny, please—for the

The Hopetouns saw the big match from
the grand-stand. On Monday, when the first
English innings closed at 385, the Governor, in
manifest perturbation, changed his quarters, and
tried to extort what consolation he might from
Stoddart and Iredale. On the final day, when it
was all up with Australia, the Countess drove
home to substitute a triumphal white robe for her
sombre-colored gown, bringing back with her
“Lord Hope, if you please,” who was allowed his
only glimpse of the match—presumably in honor
of the discomfiture of “the colonials.”
* i *
An interested spectator of the big match
was lively, blue-eyed Mrs. Giffen, her chagrin
whenever hubby failed to “come off” showing
itself only in extra hilariousness. During the last
two hours of the contest, her laugh was more
frequent than ever. But, according to the wife of
another wicket celebrity, who viewed the down-
fall of her country with a complacency perhaps ex-
cusable under the circumstances, the smiles of the
captain’s better-half were, at this stage, pathetic
attempts indeed. The “grand old cricketer”
himself piloted cups of tea and similar marks of
devotion through the crowd until, despite his
hideous blazer, every married woman within eye-
shot voted him a “pet of a husband.”

The London influenza epidemic has caused
a tremendous rise in the price of eucalyptus oil.
What sort of eucalyptus oil, The 15ulletin
wonders, do they retail in London ? A great pro-
portion of the draught eucalyptus oil ordinarily
sold by the average Australian chenr'st is fraudu-
lent rubbish, consisting of, say, a-Hfth of eucalyp-
tus extract, a-fifth of olive oil, and three-fifths of
spirits of turpentine. “The public will have
cheap oil, and we give it to them.” Not only is
such draught oil an imposture—which, by the way,
would, under an honest legal-commercial system,
be punished with gaol —but some of the bottled
oils, being made from the wrong sort of eucalyp-
tus, are of very small aceount indeed.

The tenth anniversary of the departure of
the N.S.W. Brigands for the Soudan was cele-
brated in Sj T dney on 3rd inst. The ranks of the
misguided swashbucklers have not yet begun to
appreciably thin, but it may be safely predicted—
The Bulletin takes pleasure in predicting it regu-
larly every year—that the last survivor of the ex-
pedition will be the donkey that they brought
back with them. That donkey will eat his Soudan
dinner alone after all the rest have fled to Heaven.
It is the fittest that survives.

Commandant Hutton is in such a frantic
hurry to purge the N.S.W. army, that he cannot
see the necessity for equal justice. An ex-surgeon
swears that a certain captain was suffering from
an aggravated form of a certain disease, and was
treated for it while he continued to do duty and
draw his pay. Now, if a gunner had had the
same disease, he would have been kept in the
hospital, forcibly if necessary, till cured, and
would have forfeited his pay for the time he was
there. Why this difference ?

They now call it “ the Victorian knavey.”
Miss Ada Delroy is making her
second visit to Australia under engage-
ment to the veteran variety campaigner,
Mr. Harry Rickards. After an absence
of five years (spent in India, Great
Britain, and other lands) she has come
back younger and sprightlier than ever.
There is a refined sauciness about Ada
Delroy, and what she does—song and
dance, serpentine whirl, or comedy busi-
ness with her brother, James Bell—is
done prettily. A sense of humor is
unusual among little ladies who look
sweet, and The Bux.letin publishes Miss
Delroy’s merry face for the particular
reason that she can raise a laugh as
daintily as she lifts her nimble leg. In
short, this clever variety artist has more
understandings than two.

policemen hate Sunday duty—rounding
up the publicans. Every “ peeler ”
aspires to be a publican, and the fellow-
feeling makes him wondrous kind. Two
officers had the delectable job of removing
a very dead body from a suburban house
recently. Coming out for a breath of
fresh air, “Phew! Mac.,” said Mick,
“ it’s worse than foxin’ the blessed

Inspector - General Fosbery, before the
matter came into court, instructed one of his detec-
tives to investigate the-private character of the
prosecutrix in the Sydney military court-martial
case. If the procedure be correct in this case,
why is not a State detective laid on to investigate
the lives of all girls bringing similar charges,
before the court deals with the accusations?

Quite lately Mrs. Ellis Rowan, the artist,
bad her plate, pictures, and other valuables stolen.
Ere long the thief was caught, and the lady sent
for to identify some trifle of hers still in his
possession. When she arrived she heard a pitiful
tale —a consumptive wife, the man said, having
been his incentive to dishonesty. Mrs. Rowan
went to an address given her by accused, and, sure
enough, found there a bed-ridden invalid.
Mercifully refusing to lay a charge against the
husband, she bargained only that he should point
out to her the different pawnshops where her pro-
perty was deposited. This was soon done, though,
before the owner had redeemed half her belong-
ings, her purse was empty, and she had to visit
the bank.

Dear Bulletin, —Every morning a cluster
of poorly-clad persons may be seen waiting in
Macquarie-st., Sydney, near the District Court.
A notice grimly blazoned on the wall reads : “In-
digent persons desirous of gaining admission to the
metropolitan hospitals at the cost of the vote for the
maintenance of sick paupers should apply at this
office at 10.30a.m. daily.” The unfortunates have
to air themselves for hours with this grim chronicle
relating their trouble. Over and over again I have
seen some miserably sick man, with his meagre
bundle of possessions at hand, huddled on th%
pavement, and trying to slumber away the tedium
of waiting for the medical mandate. To every
passer such men appeared only as indigent persona.
What a brutal exposition of misfortune it all is !

Dear Bulletin, — lie a much-discussed
subject. I think the present poverty-stricken
condition of the legal profession is due in great
measure to overcrowding, the result of solicitors’
blind meanness in giving clerks articles gratis—
not with the laudable intention of breaking down
the barriers of a so-called privileged profession,
but in order to get cheap labor. Clerks thus
articled only get 10s. or 15s. a week. Such mean-
ness results in said clerks, when admitted to
practice, entering into competition with their
former masters and carrying away a portion of
their work. Another cause is that numerous
clerks, formerly in the employ of solicitors, despite
the stringent provisions of the Attorneys Act (con-
stituting the legal trades-union), carry on the
practice of conveyancing and other legal work
whether capable or not, and a section of the public,
rather than incur the ordinary fees of a solicitor,
risks getting bad titles by employing such unquali-
fied persons.—Yours, &c., Veritas.

The woman here, writes a BuLLETiN-man

Hopkins to be here a few days—he would look
more solemn than ever, and the pathos of his eyes
would increase; but he would make Australia
roll over with laughing. The women generally
are fine creatures, some of them extremely tall
and graceful. I went to one political meeting,
attended by a large number of women. It was a
prohibitionist-speaker. They didn’t appear to be
interested, and acted as they do in church—stared
round and criticised each other’s toilettes. When
a round of applause came they looked round
hastily, with a “ What-was-that-he-said-I-
wasn’t-listening ” expression. There were seve-
ral benevolent old ladies there, taking a motherly
interest in the function and the speaker, who was
fairly young ; but they seemingly took little heed
of the subjects under discussion. Not one lady
applauded and, if they had any sentiments, they

Uppers and braces at Xmas-time. The “ mother-

A Melb. lady typist rides to town every

Her travelling attire, as a rule, consists of blouse

Dear Bulletin, —That separate pavilion-
entrance for the English professional cricketers
at Melbourne was an indefensible snobbery. Not
so the separate hotel-accommodation so much
commented on, because less “ frill ” and more
ease was what the p:os. wanted—and got—by an
arrangement which relieved them of unaccustomed
social restraints. It is always the conscious
inferior who is most jealous of line-drawing ; the
man who knows that he is below the salt by a
mere conventionality shrinks from doing himself
an injustice by placing his superficial inferiority
in evidence above it. —A.

The English Saturday Review gives over
a column-and-a-half of its very exclusive space to
a notice of H. A. White’s remarks on Ned Kelly,
by v hose exploits it is much impressed. Kelly is
known to Australians as an ugly, commonplace,
cold-blooded, utterly unehivalrous ruffian who
cost the community a lot of blood and money
before he was caught and hanged ; but the Satur-
day sees in him a noble outlaw, a modernised
Robin Hood, and remarks that the story of his
l'°e is an episode “in an imperfectly-evolved
~society, in which much of the virtue and more of
the skill is on the side of the rebels.” Delicious !
The writer of the article plainly regrets that such a
hero of romance was not better appreciated by his
local contemporaries. Couldn’t the police collect a
shipment of a dozen Kellys for export to England
—just to oblige the gentleman ?

It is interesting to hear that of the Sydney

Manly lady, daughter of a clergyman, won by far

Australian military officers in Victoria, it
appears, have the joint privilege of nominating one
youth a year for a commission in the Imperial
army. No undue noise has been made about this
fact, and Major Tulloch, the recently-departed
Victorian swashbuckler, although only a British
visitor, has secured the “ honor ” for his son in the
absence of any application from a properly-con-
stituted “colonist.” Now the properly-consti-
tuted are howling because knowledge of the con-
cession was not imparted to them. But it doesn’t
really matter. Australia doesn’t want to hire her
sons out as nigger-stalkers in the Imperial in-
terests, but the fact shows how ready the im-
ported hero with the padded chest is to grab with
both hands.

When Joseph Battenberg was at the
Jenolan caves he is reported to have “made a few
remarks” in eulogy of Mr, Jeremiah Wilson for
his energy in exploring these natural wonders.
The Bulletin feels sorry for J. Batt., as well as
for princes in general. The average prince is a
dreadfully bad speaker, and when he is tired
with scrambling through oaves and things he
feels grumpy and disinclined for oratory, just like
any other man. Vet he is constantly running up
against heavy social obligations, which call on him
to make a few well-chosen remarks about Mr,
Jeremiah Wilson, or Mr. William Smith, or some
other person who doesn’t in the least degree in-
terest him. Even the smallest kind of prince is
expected to be a flowing river of well-chosen re-
marks, and the burden lies heavy on his soul.
The only relief he gets is that he occasionally goes
to a strange country, and there he can use up all
his old remarks over again, and no one knows that
they are considerably the worse for wear.

Rev. William Clarke urged the Wesleyan
Conference last week to fix married ministers’
salaries at £5O per quarter, and unmarried ones’
at .£35. Which appears to settle the cost of a
wife at .£6O a year.
Cosmos for February has some in-
teresting reminiscences of Butler Cole
Aspinall, the Vic. advocate and wit, by
Mr. Chas. Bright; and to the publisher
The Bulletin is indebted for permission
to reproduce the 27-year-old photograph
of Aspinall and Dailey which appears
in this issue. When Aspinall came to
Melbourne 40 years ago, under engage-
ment to take charge of the Argus Parlia-
mentary staff, Vic. Parliament boasted
but a single Chamber, which sat in St.
Patrick’s Hall, Bourke-street, from three
till six on four afternoons a week. The
“staff” comprehended only Bright and
another youth named Mackenzie, and
Aspinall’s comment was that if one of
them took ill the strength of his army
would be seriously impaired. In the
same number of Cosmos Mrs. Charles
Bright interviews Mrs. Brough, Mr. G.
B. Barton writes on Privy Council ap-
peals, and Col. Bell collects some useful
information concerning the Nicaragua
canal—making the issue the most read-
able yet published.

In Otago (M.L.) there is a prohibi-
tion district called Olutha. The other
day, when the train stopped at Waihola,
outside the prohibited district, the usual
rush was made on the refreshment-room
by the passengers. Among them was a
well-known and highly-respected citizen
who_ sidled up to the bar and asked unob-
trusively for a simple “ginger-wine.” He
drank it at a gulp and made for the door,
where he acted as if he had swallowed a
dose of kerosene. Then he returned to the
bar, and began firing off violent abuse at
the barman, who, he asserted, had tried
to poison him. “You asked for ginger-
wine and you got it,” interjected the
barman. “I asked for ginger-wine!”
rejoined the poisoned man, “Great Scott,
don’t you know what ginger-wine is?
They know considerably better than that
up Clutha way.” Then the barman
saw light, and he smiled gently and
soothingly, and, placing a bottle of Galley
whisky before the man from the prohibition dis-
trict, he told him to help himself. Then all was
peace. Which exactly fits in with N.S.W.
Speaker Abbott’s experiences during his recent
visit to Maoriland. “ Total prohibition,” says the
Speaker, “ seems a failure as it was in prohibi-
tionist Mildura in 1892. I never saw so much
drunkenness as at the latter place. When the
Maoriland women got the vote they made a great
descent on the sale of liquor—hence all this sly
drinking.”
“ Seeing he would not last many minutes
and wanted to die quietly, I told the family there
was no likelihood of a change till next day, and
induced all to retire. He fell into his last sleep,
and in five minutes his heart stopped. I turned
into my bed in the same room and soundly slept
till seven next morning, for it had not been pos-
sible to obtain sound slumber whilst attending
this case, and it was a fortnight since I came.
Rising, the family were informed, and my engage-
ment ended. Cruel? No, He wanted to die
quietly in sleep, and people fussing about only
annoyed him. What was done was the best for

A new sulphurous evangelist is raging
in Maoriland. One of his recent converts
was an Auckland negro, who was so badly
scared by the missionary that he went
straight away and drowned himself in another
man’s tank of drinking-water to escape from his
horrible thoughts of the hereafter. Every evan-
gelist of any account leaves a trail of lunatics and
suicides in his devastated wake, and it is about
time the law compelled the itinerant preacher to
fit up beside his church a room with all the latest
appliances for painless extinction, so that his con-
verts may suicide decently and in order. Even in
the cause of religion no man has a right to drive
another man into anybody’s supply of drinking-
water.

Strange, but true, that new religious sects
founded “ at ’Ome ” find “ colonial ” soil the most
fertile, once the seed is planted. The Catholic-
Apostolic Church (London) was founded many
years ago by 12 young gentlemen who were ap-
pointed “ Apostles.” Of these, 11 are dead, and
the existence of the survivor appears to be an
essential factor in the existence of the creed.
This Apostle, aged 89, took influenza about 18
months ago, and has been sent out here to recover
his health, thereby throwing the responsibility of

“ IMITATION

The articles most imitated are
CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER’S PILLS.
WHY?
BECAUSE they have the best reputation and
are most in demand by the public, consequently,
every dishonest trader tries to trade on their fame
and renown.
It is really wonderful that the Australian people
are so slow to see the truth as regards the unscru-
pulous quacks and charlatans who prey on the
credulity of the Australian public. Scarcely a
week ever passes but what the press exposes the
barefaced and shameful practices of some of these
harpies, yet, in face of all, they seem to thrive,
and the paper which hounds them down most thrives
fattest on their advertisements and cracks cham-
pagne over each balance-sheet. Clements Tonic
and Fletcher’s Pills have never yet stooped to
deception and misrepresentation. They are scien-
tific therapeutical agents, and evidence as to their
value can be found in every district, and, such
being the case, it is unnecessary to further extol
their virtues.

A remarkable case was recently tried at
Roma (Q.). One black had killed another with a
nulla. The crime arose out of aboriginal super-
stition. It was alleged that the deceased, a medi-
cine-man, had procured a human bone, blackened
it, smeared it with human blood, and pointed it
with maleficent intent at the prisoner and his gin
while they slept. Consequently the gin fell sick,
and the prisoner, having ascertained the cause,
brained ..the wizard with a nulla. Griffith, 0.J.,
took a lenient view of the case and inflicted three
years’ penal servitude on the murderer. It is
asserted, by the way, that this bone superstition
extends right throughout Australia.

he can see no reasonable excuse for denying them their

Mr. F. KENNA.
Perhaps the poems of Mr. Francis Kenna
(“K.,” of The Bulletin) are sweeter separately
savoured than collected in the neat little volume
just issued by Melville, Mullen, and Slade. His
pretty fancies are nearly always deftly phrased ;
yet, meeting them not as single spies, but as mar-
ried, with an offspring of 52 pages, one is assailed
by a sense of slightness, and sameness, and stiffness
all absent from the original reading. A set of
newspaper verses is a plea ; a book is a challenge ;
and we naturally extend to the debutant promise
a welcome which the veteran performance is
naturally expected to justify. Mr. Kenna’s
“ Songs of a Season ” is a collection of promises—
some of them very fine promises indeed ; but he
must do something better before he can be rank* d
with the immortals. Of course, he is not a
veteran yet; cr he would not jar a delicate ear by
rhyming “ dawn ” and “ newborn ’’—“dawning ”
and “ warning.” The Muse’s palate dislikes such
acids even in the hotch-potch of a hasty news-
paper ; and they are utterly forbidden to a poet
who sets out to scale Parnassus in nice brown
covers with a neat gold label. These sentences may
seem to read unkindly. They are not so meant,
for The Pulletin has real admiration and real
hopes for Mr. Kenna ; and, in reprinting a poem
which justifies both hope and admiration, it
assures readers who buy Mr. Kenna’s book that
they will find there two or three poems as good,
many nearly as good, and hardly one which doe*
not please to pause over.

Tliiousin scopes of sky, and under
The deeps of earth «nd sea,
My soul went out in wonder,
To find hut myttery ;
A homeless storm-bird flying
Through dim dark seas uncrying,
Till spent with fruitless trying
It came again to me ;
To find its old home dreary.
Because all things had clanged.
And all old ways were weary,
For that its wings had ranged
O’er leagues of seas unsound, d,
Through skies by clouds unrounded,
Through fields of space unbounded.
In ways from wings estranged.
But ere its final turning,
It felt in frowning skies
The deathless glory burning
In Wisdom’s wond’rous eyes ;
That they who see, shall never
Find rest again for ever,
Till time at last shall sever
The grain from chaff of lies.
Mine eyes go forth to seaward
In mute expectancy,
To skyward, or to leeward,
To find some hope for me ;
The sullen skies are storm y,
And waves and winds before me ;
I curse the times that bore me,
And dream of times to be.
I have grown tired of living
A life that no one knows,
I sing no glad thanksgiving,
While men are weighed with woes ;
I know the winds are blowing,
I know the tide is flowing,
I know that Truth is growing,
Through all her thousand throes.
I know that Earth the mother
Shall be to all men free,
That each will owm the other
In days that yet shall be ;
I hear like maidens sirfging,
In leafy splendors swinging,
The slow years homeward bringing
The fruits of earth and saa.
But now 7, like sad seas sobbing
’Gainst bold, black headlands strong,
I hear the world’s woes throbbing
Against the shores of Wrong,
That shake above and under.
When Freedom’s tempests thunder—
I hear these things and wonder:

Amy Roselle’s nightly demise, at Melb. Bijou, as Esther
Bandraz, makes the women snivel, but it is, for all that,
a rather stagey decease. She lies back on a sofa, in a
flood of limelight and a tight corset, and gasps like a
wheezy steam-roller doing a particularly uphill bit of
wdrk. Then she pants, tremolo, to the woman who has
been her hated rival, “ Ki-i-i-iss m-e-e a-g-gain, my
m-o-o-other ki-l-issed me so-o-o-o!” Having been duly
kissed, she rolls off the sofa into the very centre of the
stage, winks to the man who holds the curtain-rope in
the prompt corner, and gives up the ghost to slow music,
just as the sound of Dacre’s pistol comes from the wings
—Dacre having been suiciding in a leisurely fashion
during Esther’s last movements.
Ethel Haydon, of Melb., was engaged to support May
Yoh6 (now really Lady Clinton Hope, and presumptive
Duchess of Newcastle) in Sims and Caryll’s new piece,
“Little Dick Whittington,” at London Avenue. “I
almost pity her,” writes The Bulletin’s London corres-
pondent, “ for May brooks no rival near the throne, and
if the fair Ethel has really talent, and is likely to become
a favorite, the Hon. May will make it hot for her, as she
has for many others before —to wit, Alice Lethbridge, &c.

A little girl with large, innocent eyes, baby curls, and
wearing a sunbonnet, fell into the hands of the Melb.
police the other day and told them a long, romantic story
Of a jouwipy from" Maoriland, and her experiences as a
homeless toddler in a strange, wicked city. She had
travelled to Melb., she said, to get an engagement as a
song-and-dance artist, and she had bounced accommoda-
tion at hotels for several days on the strength of being a
poor little thing without any ma. The sceptical police-
man immediately removed the sweet child’s sunbonnet,
whereupon she grew suddenly old and displayed an air of
much guile, and at once admitted that she wasn t an
orphan, nor was she of particularly tender years, and she
hailed from Brunswick, and was simply “out on her
own.” Case pending. The sunbonnet of late has covered
a multitude of sinners.

Hare was obdurate. To this Ellen’s reply was a large

Cissy Loftus left the Augustin Daly Co. (so she says)
because she would not play second fiddle to Ada Rehan !
The real reason, says Tub Bulletin’s London corres-

has wisely reverted to the music-halls, where originality is
not quite so necessary. She has had an enormous suc-

engagement to Morton, of the Palace, at a salary of £lOO

When Lydia Thompson horsewhipped Storey, editor of
Chicago Times, about 20 years ago, Bunyan, the magis-

brette wrote Bunyan a nicely-scented, little pink note
acknowledging his impartiality, expressing her con-
trition for having, in a moment of excitement, committed
the assault, and enclosing four tickets for central reserved
front seats of the circle. Bunyan, who had a most unfor-
tunately-ornamented and highly-colored nose, fell into
the trap, attended the theatre en famille, and had the
satisfaction of hearing Lydia sing her (then famous) song,
“ It Ever I Cease to Love,” with the refrain at the end of
each verse altered to
“ May Banyan’s nose turn into a rose
If ever I cease to love !”
SPORTING NOTIONS.
From the long-drawn faces on Collina-street
Block after the result of the fifth test-match became
known, a stranger wou'd have thought that half the
population had died suddenly, and the other half was
mourning its loss.
* « • •
Great as was Turner’s disappointment at his
exclusion from the final test-team, it must have been
more than compensated for by Stoddart’s holding up the
ball at the conclusion of the match, and thanking the
gods that “ The Terror ” had not the handling of it.
• ♦ * •
The coolness of M‘Laren’s batting in the Eng-
lishmen’s second innings was painful—for Giff. There
were still 60 runs to be made when Mae. joined his county-
mate, Ward, who had got his own score to 70 and seemed
in a fair way to bring off a “century.” The new-comer
played as though they had thegarne already won, making
singles easily and lazily off Giffen for the sake of giving
Ward the next strike. However, the pro. didn’t make
the most of the opportunities offered him. A full-pitched
one from Harry Trott eventually took his wicket when he
was seven notches short of the hundred. Then Peel came
in, and the odd 20 runs required by England were
quickly knocked up.
Ward’s 93 was a very tame performance com-
pared with Brown’s 140. The little youngster demoralised
the Australian howling, while the cautious man at the other
wicket pottered along in very nervous style. Ward was a
constant reminder that the Englishmen had a heavy task
to struggle with, but Brown was a bold assertion that
Australia had better make up its mind to get licked. A
local hero, playing the game that Brown played, would
have been cheered at every stroke. Young Australia
only appreciates fast cricket from its own siie. The bulk
of the audience reserved its applause for the plucky bats-
man’s downfall.
M‘Kibbin was fated to chase the “fonrer ” that
won the test-match for the Englishmen. Having arrived
at the ball he was preparing to throw in as per usual, but
a hundred voices yelled, “ Keep it 1 ” Even then the
Bathurst pet seemed doubtful as to whether he had any
right to hold the ball, so they shouted again, “ Keep it! ”
A generous-minded bairacket for Australia moved as an
amendment—" Keep it, and give it to Brown.” He gave
it to Stoddart.
At the outset Stoddart’s team, on paper, had a
fair show of beating Australia, best three out of five, by
keeping the runs down. They left England with the
reputation of being' barely good enough to win on the
extra strength of their bowling. Yet it was the weakness
of the Australian attack which won them two victories in
Melbourne, and enabled them to snatch the first Sydney
game out of the fire.
The Englishmen’s six wickets to spare in last
week’s “decider” didn’t necessarily represent many'
runs, judging from the sick performance of the men who
came after M’Laren and Peel in the first innings. Ford,
Briggs and Lockwood batted so pooily under encouraging
circumstances, that no one would have felt surprised to
see them go for a “ duck ” apiece had they been required
to face a crisis. But England won by six wickets, and the
admitted unreliability of the tail-end of the team made
the batting work of the head and body so much the more
creditable. Furthermore, the Australians were outshone
by their rivals at every point. Richardson knocked down
6 wickets. Peel 3 and Briggs 2. Trott, who came out with
far the best average on our side, had only one case of
clean bowled. The three highest individual scores in the
match were made by M’Laren, Brown and Ward; also,
Peel got more runs for “ once out ” than any man on the
losing side. The Britishers’ fielding was a little better all-
round than the Australians’, and their rate of scoring was
the faster throughout the match.
» * » •
When the Englishmen come to meet Victoria
and South Australia, for a wind-up, they will drop the
careful game which Stoddart foisted upon them. Palience
was a virtue in the second test-match, but dash won
them the final. Stoddart himself hit almost as freely as
of old. Peel laid the wood on, M’Laren lost no time,
and Brown batted like a bantam-cock. Briggs, Ford, and
Lockwood opened lankily, and were promptly caught
close to the wicket. The only case of hitting that didn’t
succeed at all was Brockwell. He may “ come off ”
before the tour is finished.
» * » ♦
Stoddart, the most discreet of speechmakers,
having won the rubber, dropped a delicate reminder that
his team wasn’t the strongest All England lot imaginable,
though it had done what the strongest would have felt
proud to do. A seasonable remark considering all the local
references to “ ashes,” and “ match of the century.”
• • • •
Blackham must swallow his angry prophecy
that Richardson would get the cover knocked off him if
he came to Australia. They have scored off the express
bowler, but rarely punished him. It was the pace of the
ball that made most of the runs.
• » * ♦
Two bits of cricket-report from Melb. Herald :
“Lyons went in to join Gregory after the Englishmen
had the good luelc to get rid of Darling by splendid field-
ing before he had well got going. Then Gregory, getting
in front of Richardson, nftluckrly just tipped one of the
express ones from the Surrey bowler behind the wickets.”
. . . “M‘Kd)binhad howling well, and trying to
get Brown in the slips, and at last he succeeded.” Bad
luck, it seems, killed the two Australians, but the
Britishers’ dismissal was the natural result of artful bowl-
ing. As a matter of fact, Brown went out of his way to
hit at the very “off ” M’Kibbin ball, because he had prac-
tically won the game and could afford to be incautious.
The ball never threatened his wicket. Ward subsequently
let half-a-dozen such pass him without attempting to
touch them.
« * ♦ •
When Johnny Briggs made his “duck ” in the
late test-match, he was never more disgusted in his life.
“Just like me,” he remarked candidly, “ the ball beat me
all the way, and I thought I was good for a hundred.”
Poor little Briggs.
♦ • ♦ ♦
It was stated in Wednesday’s papers that one
reason why Iredale did not score was his inability to sleep
the previous night, owing to a severe attack of toothache
and neuralgia. On reaching his hotel same night, he
found two telegrams from Sydney patent-medicine men,
advising him to try their tonics. In addition there were
sundry boxes of pills and liquid concoctions from Smell-
bourne vendors. Iredale was, of course, asked, in each
case, to send along a line as to the beneficial effects of the
mixtures.
* * ♦ *
The band was absent from the big match, and
the crowd felt grateful. It got tired of music that only
came without discord belw’een overs. During play the
performers’ eyes were divided between their own scores
and the other players’ scores, with a consequence that
“sundries,” “M’Laren, 100,” and the bowling-average
got plaved instead of the lovely strains of “Sweet Marie.”
The big drummer was the only consistent performer. He
was able to follow the game all the time, the only draw-
back being that he, in his cricket enthusiasm, always
kept on playing a solo some time after the rest had
knocked off.
* * * *
Overheard at the match : “ Who caught that?”
“Trott!” “What Trott?” “It’s not rot!” “Well,
what did you say it was for?” “ Because it was Trott !”
"What Trott?” “Rot to you, and be damned!”
“ Suna to you if you can’t answer a civil question !”
(Left thrashing the matter out).
' * • » *
The Australian, defeat quite spoilt the big
“ continental ” arranged in Adelaide for Giffen. George
was to be welcomed as the captain and hero of the Aus-
tralian team but—alas, Brown and Ward !
That wizardess waa right. England won.
• « • •
In the five test-matches England played nine
innings and four wickets, and made 2399 runs : Australia
played nine innings and made 2822 runs. Players and
aggregate scores were as under :
England tried 7 bowlers in the five matches,
who bowled 5811 balls, 229 maidens, 4 wides, 7 no-balls
and took 86 wickets. Australia tried 14 bowlers, who
bowled 5682 balls, 283 maidens, 7 wides, 7 no-balls and
took 91 wickets. The Englishmen clean-bowled 33
wickets, of which Richardson took 26. The Australians
clean-bowled 28, Giffen being responsible for 9. Forty-
six Australians were caught out, Phillipson and Peel being
most successful with 8 each. Fifty-two Englishmen were
caught, Giffen, Iredale, H. Trott, Darling, and Bruce
dividing honors. Three Australians were stumped, 2 by
Phillipson, 1 by Gay, while 8 Englishmen were similarly
dismissed, Jarvis stumping 7. Four Australians w r ere run-
out, and 1 Englishman.
* * * ♦
The aggregate number of different players from
each cricketing province, and the runs contributed by
each group, in the five matches, were as follows
The sending of M'Kibbin to Brisbane was an
error in tactics. Whilst he was taking the Englishmen’s
wickets they took the measure of his twist.
* * * •
M’Kibbin’s bowling, as viewed by the English-
men, had no method in it. All twist and no length.
« * * *
As regards that fifth test-match, all that Aus-
tralia can congratulate itself upon is that H. Trott, the
fat man of the team, scored 42 runs in each innings,
obtained best bowling average against the English each
innings, and fielded with sensational adroitness and
success. This last consideration touches The Bulletin to
the core: imagination-fondly dwells upon the spectacle
of the fat man fielding with ideal grace and agility, and
covering the enemies of Australia with confusion amid
the thundeis of the assembled thousands. It compensates
for all. What though the battle between the teams was
bitter and prolonged ; what though Australia was ulti-
mately borne down and conquered ; what though Brown,
the fat man of the English, in great measure did it all
himself by scoring 140 runs at the crisis ! Did not Trott,
Australia’s fat man, shine in every department of the
game? And can anything be superior to all-round excel-
lence? And, therefore, though the laurels of the match as
such would otherwise go to the English team, Australia
can raise her head in pride, and gaze with love and ad-
miration upon her noble son, whose fat bore bravely up
upon that fatal day and wrested from the might "of a
whole conquering team the robe of triumph and the
crown of glory.
* * * ♦
Brockwell on Australian cricket: “The best
Australian wicket is far better than the best English
wicket, and the worst is much worse. . . . Events
have justified the opinion I formed that Bruce would be
the most dangerous batsmen we should meet on our tour.
. . . George Giffen stands perhaps without a peer as
an all-round player. . . . The Australian spectator is
apparently overstrung, and, as a consequence, is impatient
and intolerant. . . . The spectators would sometimes
get better play if, instead of badgering a player who has
for a moment failed, they would encourage him.”
» ♦ * *
Turner’s figures make him out to have been the
most valuable of the Australian bowlers in test-matches.
He certainly had the benefit of three wet wickets—two at
Sydney and one at Melbourne—to perform upon, but, on
the other hand, he stood out of the Adelaide match when
theover-anxious Englishmen were undoubtedly “cooked”
by the sun. Turner shifted 18 batsmen at an average
cost of 19£ runs, and his proportion of maiden overs was
40 per cent.
* » * *
Richardson’s batting figures are peculiar. In
test-matches he averaged 9 2-5 runs for 9 innings, although
his tallest score was only 12.
* * * •
Interest in the final test-match was specially
strong in Ballarat. When the result was announced at a
meeting of the local Exchange, an excited broker unfurled
a Union Jack and sang “ Kule Britannia,” which he
repeated later on in the share-market. This roused some
ot the Australians, who responded by hoisting the
Southern Cross and singing “ The Men of Australia.” A
ridiculous scene was brought to an appropriate conclusion
by the Englishers raising “ God save the Queen.”

Outside the Melb. Argus office the other Wed-

enormously on learning of Sloddart’s downfall that the
crowd was pushed almost on to the tramlines. Three

small that you could have packed the lot into a tram-car.

The swallows on Melb. Cricket Ground, when
skimming over the grass during the big match, deceived
many, who mistook them for the ball. People were taken
in so" often that they became annoyed, especially if they
had given a yell of applause for a boundary hit which had
been snapped up at point.
Just before the recent test-match, an M.C.C.
committee-man overheard, as he sat in his office, a sub-
ordinate promise an impecunious friend the loan of his
(the sub.’s) member’s ticket for the approaching match.
The listener said nothing then, but laid his plans so
effectually that, when the time came, not only was the
interloper refused admission, but his would-be benefactor
was hauled before the committee. More than one mem-
ber would have let the culprit off as a first offender,
but his accuser required a year’s suspension.

The raffling of the splendid St. Alban’s estate
and stud is probably only another pro< f that racing and
breeding combined don’t pay. Some 28 years ago the
Fishers di-poed of their big stud by art-union—the
draw took place at the old St. George’s Hall (now the Cam-
bridge Music Hall), Houike-st. The great Fishhook was
the first prize, and the children from the Blind School
worked the boxes. Johnny Wallis and Co., bookmakers,
drew Fishhook (and gave the blind girls £5O each), but he
was a failure, and at the stud got nothing—bar The Hook,
now in America.

The Champion race lasted half a second longer
than the "full-stake ” limit time fixed by the V.R.O. —
srain. 45seo. Therefore, the owners of the winner and
placed horses received only half the money given last
year, and the sightseers, who had hoped to see a real three-
mile gallop, were glad to know the club saved £5OO by
the waiting tactics of the jockeys. Nothing started
off to make the running this year, for the simple reason
that none of the horses was reckoned equal to a big per-
formance. Dotty Patron is seemingly not quite the same
hero who won the Melbourne Cup, and Carnage, although
better than the Cup-winner at the present time, has not
recovered the “form ” which beat the Patron of sixteen
months ago. The Harvester was, no doubt, good enough
to win the race whatever way it had been run, but his
condition didn’t warrant an attempt to force the pace,
whilst Preston wasn’t sent to the front, inasmuch as Har-
vester had outstayed him in the Australian Cup two days
before.
Stevenson made a brilliant finish with Dampiei
for the V.R.O. Free Handicap. He came with a late rush
and won on the post, by half-a-head, in the English-
jockey style which Mick O’Brien cultivated so success-
fully here. But Stevenson’s bit of riding was merely the
desperate effort of a boy r who had been blocked until the
last minute. He would have rushed earlier—and might
have lost the race in consequence—but for being hampered
by the mob of cattle.
IT IS EASY TO ASK QUESTIONS.
A CHILD can ask questions that a wise man can’t
answer. Yes; and there are some questions that
the ablest doctors don’t like to have people ask
them. Say a question of this sort —while we are
about it, however, we might as well tell the story
straight away and have done with it.
Mrs. Sarah Mace was very ill with influenza.
That was in February, 1892, the time of the
epidemic. The attack was severe. She was
suddenly seized with a violent pain in the head
(both front and back) and temples. She had pain
in all her joints, too, and was hot and feverish.
She went to bed and sent for the doctor. He came,
examined her, took her temperature—over 100
degrees—and said very little, like a wise man.
The lady could not turn herself in bed. She lived
on slops, such as milk and broth ; she could not
swallow a morsel of solid food. Her husband
pressed her to take strong food, saying, “If you
don’t eat you will starve.” Right enough ; but he
forgot that when one can’t eat he can’t eat, and
there’s an end.
Well, she got weaker and weaker, and fell away
until there wasn’t much left of her but skin and
bone. Then, in her anxiety, she put her question :
“ Doctor, do you think I shall get well ?"
The doctor’s answer was true and honest; we
like and respect him for it. He said, “Mrs. Mace,
Ido not know.” He couldn’t tell. Neither could
any other doctor. No ; not even if he had a string
of titles to his name as long as a kite’s tail. But
did she get well? Wait a bit. We must hark
back a minute now.
Along about the 10th of March, 1880, Mrs. Mace
began to feel tired, languid and weary, as if her
work was too much for her, she said. She had a
bad taste in the mouth, poor appetite, and what-
ever she ate gave her pain at the chest and heart.
“I had,” she continues, “a dull heavy pain at the
right side and between the shoulders, and a sinking
feeling at the pit of the stomach, and a rising of
foul gas in my throat. Later on I had rheumatic
pains in my heart, chest and back. I sent for a
doctor, who attended me for six weeks, but I got
worse. One day the cook said, ‘Why don’t you
try Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup ? ’ —this being
a medicine my mistress (I was living with a lady
in Camden Town) kept in the house for family use.
I did so, and was soon as strong as ever.
Years fled away, and in 1891 she had the first
attack of influenza, and in 1892, the second, al-
ready described in part. We now complete the
account of the 1892 attack.
Mrs. Mace says: “The doctor continued to
attend mo for five weeks, and I took his medicines
for that time, but gained no strength. After hav-
ing suffered for seven weeks I said to my husband,
' I will now see what Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup will do for me. Perhaps it may cure
influenza as well as other ailments.’ I carried out
this resolution ; began taking the Syrup, and was
soon on my feet again, and have since kept in
excellent health, taking an occasional dose when
needed. (Signed) Sarah Mace, Monk’s Farm,
Great Warley, Brentwood, Essex, August 27th,
1892.”
Now we have never advertised Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup as a remedy for influenza. Yet
the facts stated by Mrs. Mace cannot be disputed.
What is the conclusion ? A very simple one in-
deed. She did not have influenza until her system
had been debilitated by indigestion and dyspepsia.
It is such people generally (almost wholly) that
all epidemic diseases attack. The dreaded cholera
scarcely ever touches anybody except a dyspeptic
—cholera is a malady of the bowels only. The
more we hear of disease the more the proof piles
up, showing that persons with a sound digestion
are safe against dying of anything except violence
or old age. The Syrup cured Mrs. Mace’s influenza
by taking away the ground it stood on —the tor-
pidity of her digestion.
She once asked, “ Doctor, do you think I shall
get well?” Time and Mother Seigel have said,
“Yes.”

Only 1 0/- for this REALLY RELIABLE “Double.”

Vide the Press-“ Mr. A. W. Steel is ALWAYS
good over Sydney events.”
Mr. Steel wishes to inform his clients in N.S.W. that
he has HIS BEST TOUT stationed at RANDWICK
from NOW until the END of the great A.J.C. AUTUMN
MEETING—I3-20TH APRIL.
Commissions
Also executed on the above TWO RACES (or on any
other FUTURE EVENTS) by Mr. A. W. Steel (mem-
ber of Tattersall’s), either on HIS selections or on client’s
OWN fancies, and the LONGEST PRICES always ob-

POST in ALL cases. Send for Price-lists, sent GRATIS.
ALL communications to be sent to above address in
MELBOURNE, where Mr. Steel HIMSELF REMAINS
(until the ABOVB-mentioned A.J.C. meeting), for the
purpose of attending PERSONALLY to his
& DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENTS
which he is undertaking EVERY SATURDAY over the
CURRENT Races, for clients who cannot themselves
attend. He is SO investing on NEXT Saturday (16th
inst.) at Caulfield and A.J.C. Races (the Hopetoun
complimentary meeting), and on the FOLLOWING
Saturday (23rd inst.)over the V.R.C. Complimentary
Meeting at Flemington, where he anticipates being
EQUALLY AS SUCCESSFUL
as he was the other week at Epsom races, where he took
(for self and clients) over
£lOOO OUT OF “THE RING.”
of which CONTRADICTION IS DEFIED, either by
Mr. Steel’s clients or by “ the Ring,” which latter body,
indeed, will bear him out in the above statement, only
TOO RELUCTANTLY. The “ DIVIDEND ” per £5
entrusted to Mr. STEEL over the above was £5O 18s,
(LESS Commission and PLUS “ Stake-money ”).
AUTHENTIC copy of winning STATEMENT sent
on application.
BT- PRESS OPINION.-"Mr. STEEL FRE-
QUENTLY makes those of his clients who cannot
PERSONALLY attend the Races, and who entrust to
him a few pounds to invest for them ‘at the post,'
GOOD WINNERS.” (10 per cent, charged on WIN-
NINGS only.)
HESF” And, finally, PRESS, OPINION of February 6,
1891: —“These Discretionary Investments undertaken by
Mr. A. W. STEEL must perforce be better than backing
‘ Doubles,’ etc., for Big Races (albeit Mr. Steel also under-
takes SUCH commissions when desired), and also better
than SWEEPS, where the chances are 1000 to 1 against
you, whereas HERE the chances are all IN YOUR.
FAVOR.”

COMMENDATIONS, etc., see back flies of THIS
paper; also advertisements in Melb. Sportsman, Adelaide
Observer, etc.
N.B.—Clients who have not SUFFICIENT TIME
to send their money for INVESTMENTS by post can do
so by WIRE.
Mr. A. VV. STEEL is the ONLY ACCREDITED
PUBLIC INVESTOR in Melbourne, and the ONLY ONE
who often has A GOOD WIN HIMSELF, and who causes
his DISCRETIONARY INVESTING CLIENTS to do like-
wise. Therefore,
COMMON SENSE
points to your entrusting HIM (and HIM ONLY) with
your INVESTMENTS.
Send for New General Circular just
Issued (sent GRATIS on receipt of address), explaining
fully the nature of these Investments, and showing
CLEARLY the ADVANTAGES of dealing with a man of
Mr. A. W. STEEL’S well-known ability and integrity.

Stevenson aforesaid, who won the Champion on
The Harvester, seems to be the coming light-weight. He
rode three other winners during the same afternoon,
showing splendid judgment of pace. He can scale 6st.
81b. without much trouble.
♦ » * •
Harvester’s defeat by Preston in the Leger is
now accounted for by lack of condition and the need of a
few “ winding-up ” gallops to make him “cherry-ripe.”
Touts had represented Cook’s favorite as the most wound-
up horse on the training-track.
* * * *
Both the V. R.C. and V.A.T.O. are to give a
farewell complimentary meeting to his Ex. Lord Hope-
toun, which doesn’t mean that his Ex. will scoop the pro-
ceeds. The compliment of being invited to come along
and see a lot of horses “run stiff” is rather a doubtful
one, but the business idea is brilliant. Williamson and
Musgrove may as well tender a grand farewell compli-
mentary matinee to Hopey, for their own benefit.
* * * *
When will the crowd decline to feed the Ring
by making favorites of good hors"B when they are really
owned by bookmakers? Surely two recent big events are
severe enough lessons for any but born idiots !
* * * *
Why should a hawker not be allowed to crawl
his rounds with a lame moke, whilst a racehorse owner is
allowed to try and cut out a Newmarket Handicap with a
dead lame ’un ?
* ♦ * *
According to the not very reliable local journals,
there was a capital attendance at Flemington on Cham-
pion Day, although the Australian Cup show, clashing
with the cricket-match, was admittedly a failure. The
writer can’t remember a smaller or tamer Champion Day
crowd than this year’s. Less than a dozen people saw the
favorite mounted in the paddock, and when Gough
jumped on to Carnage’s back, only the trainer and a
stable-boy were standing by. In the palmy days of White
and Hales, and even last year when Portsea left the pad-
dock for the course, a mob of admirers gave the favorite a
send-off. This year there was no send-off, not even an
“ ovation,” as the favorite galloped in a winner. Perhaps
the public are tired of horse-worship.
* * * *
Slavin (says The Bulletin’s London corres-
pondent) has taken on a big job in tackling that smiling
darkey, “ Coffee-Cooler ” Craig. The “ Waler ” has just
gone into training and looks the picture of what a healthy
man should be six weeks before being wound up for a
stiff fight. He has a considerable advantage in height
and weight over his adversary, but the latter has never
yet been fairly extended, and we really don’t know how
good he is. Slavin we know all about, and as he has not
been exactly a Rechabite for the last two years, I have
very great doubt whether he will bear the strain. The
“Cooler,” on the contrary, is the personification of
steadiness—a man who, seeing that there is money in it,
makes use of his skill to take up a profession which he
really does not care about. He prudently invests his
winnings in good securities, and can now count his
wealth by thousands. [Cabled that Slavin knocked Craig
out in one round.]
* * * *
It was no disgrace, says The Bulletin’s London
correspondent, to Tom Williams, of Melbourne, to be
beaten by Dick Burge, who is not alone the champion in
his class, but one of the cleverest of boxers, and almost
Mitchell’s equal in ring-tactics. The blow which settled
Tom was not exactly a fluky one, but had the hurricane
fighter, as he is called, been a bit more careful he would
not have given the opening. He was just getting out of
reach when Burge saw his opportunity and almost threw
himself at Williams. They are sure to meet again, as
Williams’ backers still believe in the lad. Aldershot,
where Tom gives boxing lessons, was nearly “ broke ” by
his defeat.

Mr. B. E. Minns, an Australian-born
artist of sterling personal worth, whose name
and talent are familiar to Bulletin readers, and
whose portrait is printed on page 10 of this issue,
quits Sydney for England this week. The limits
of Australian art are still narrow, and there
naturally comes a time when our bush fledglings
yearn to try their pinions in a wider air. Mr.
Minns is of lusty growth, and goes with happy
auspices. He leaves behind him a tale of solid
artistic achievement which gives high promise for
his future. The Bulletin joins a host of friends
in wishing him the luck that his pluck and ability
deserve.
Cabled that Queensberry’s counsel, in the
Oscar Wilde libel-case, insinuates undue familiarity
between Oscar and the Marquis’ son—Lord Alfred
Douglas. Such charges are very easy to make,
and, once made, whether true or false, the man
accused, if at all sensitive, may as well commit
suicide.

John Duthie, M.H.R. (M.L.), who passed
through Sydney, the other day, en route for Eng-
land, where he proposes to slate the finance of
Premier Seddon’s Government —Treasurer Ward
is going ’Ome as a counterblast to Duthie —is a
large, grey Scotchman with a scowl and a re-
munerative wholesale and retail ironmongery
business situate in Wellington and adjacent parts.
Somebody once said of him he had “ murder in
his face and charity in his heart; ” and he is like
that. He has built up a large business in Maori-
land, has been Mayor and other things, is popular
with all classes, and has one of the finest stocks
of native obstinacy beneath the Southern Cross.
He is a slow, ponderous and determined speaker,
n > mean financial authority, and bites off the tails
of his words.
Mr. Guy Boothby, the well-advertised
and modest great Australian explorer, who knows
the “ secrets of the darkest portions of the con-
tinent” (he once performed an intrepid journey
from Brisbane overland to Maryborough, during
which the heroic party were lost in the scrub and
had to go without whisky for three whole hours),
is the son of Mr. Justice'Boothby, who years ago
caused such trouble by his “contumacy,” and was
removed from Adelaide Supreme Court Bench by
a vote of both Houses of Parliament. Mr. Guy
B. arrived in Adelaide five or six years ago, and
for two years was private secretary to Mr. L.
Cohen, money-lender, then Mayor of Adelaide —
who, in the eternal fitness of things, gave no less
than three balls during his term of office. While
in the confidential service of this much-respected
per-shenter Mr. Boothby must indeed have learned
a bit about “ the dark and mysterious places of the
great Australian continent.”
About 20 years ago an American darkey,
who was cooking for a station on Hellfire Plains,
having put together a cheque, started for the
nearest shanty to go into liquidation. He had a
high time for a week or so, and started away with
bluey, a bottle of supposed rum, and the horrors,
to seek for a new job and get a fresh calabash.
This was in, say, Jan., ’74. In Feb., ’75, a
man attached to a tank-sinking camp was
riding through the long grass, making for the
blue-ruin shop, when he came across a corpse,
black and perfectly preserved as to shape but as
hollow as a d.um. The clothes had been stripped
off and lay rotting not far away. The eyes were
open, and, strange to say, had not been eaten by
crows, cats, iguanas, or any other vermin. (The
want of timber accounts for this.) The empty
bottle lay beside the dead nigger. An inquest
was held, and the body ordered to be buried. A
coffin was made at the nearest station, and a
statien-hand sent to convey it to its destination.
The man stopped at the shanty to discuss things,
became cross-legged, and started off, perched on
top of the coffin, in the usual bush-pub. style— i.e.,
at top speed. Fell off, broke his back. A fresh
inquest was held, and a new coffin provided for
the nigger—which was sheer waste, as he didn’t
need one at all, and might very well have
been left in the long grass until the next bush-fire
came along. Doctor said the nig. was so well
pickled with rum or kerosene that he defied the
usual decaying influences, and gradually his
tissues were consumed by the ants, leaving bones
and skin, as may often be seen in the case of
horses and cattle. Does not Max O Rell say
that alcohol is King in this island ? It looks like
it, anyhow.— Gunyah Tom.
Melbourne monumental masons, if not
paid for their work, now pillory the dead and
shame the living by exhibiting in the front row of
their yards the tombstones, with inscriptions,
which have remained on their hands for the
reason aforesaid. Thu practice has grown con-
siderably during the lust two years.
The rumor of that legacy of £17,000, said
to have been willed to a famous boom-dame by her
long-lost unole, makes dead-and-buried financial
soandals “squeak and gibber” in their shrouds.
The fortunate legatee, ’tis said, leaves for England
shortly, to return later on with the dollars.

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heelCC,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating whatsizeyou generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to. It you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
count ry disl ricts where practical boofmaking is unknown,
has decided to supply Us patrons at the lowest cash price.

CITY MUTUAL LIFE
ASSURANCE SOCIETY, Limited.
HEAD OFFICE :
Intersection Hunter, Bligh & Castlereagh Streets, Sydney.
The most Liberal and Progressive Life Office in Australia.
IST Points worth noting about the 16th Annual lieport :—
1. NEW BUSINESS shows an Increase—£4l47, as against £3750
for 1893.
A Society’s increasing New Business is always Strong Evidence of its Increasing
Popularity.
2. RENEWAL PREMIUMS show a Considerable Improvement
—£22,593 for 1894, as against £21,293 for 1893.
The CITY MUTUAL LIFE is the Only Office which so far has been able to show an
Improvement in this respect.
3. DEATH CLAIMS are Remarkably Small. More than 40 per
cent, less than might have been expected under the Table
of Mortality on which the Society is working (the H.M.) —
£4983, as against £B5OO expected.
This evidences the Strictest Care in the Selection of Risks.
4. The BONUS CERTIEICATES for the past three years, 1892,
1893 and 1894, are expected to issue shortly. Alter this

GRAND DISTRIBUTION
OF THE FAR-FAMED
St ALBAN’S ESTATE,
GEELONG, VICTORIA.
Conducted by Mr. George Adams (Tattersall’s).
IN placing this property before the public, Mr. Adams desires to say that no more bona
fide venture has ever been offered. Mr. W. R. Wilson has most reluctantly agreed to
submit it, owing to his time being entirely occupied with his other pursuits. In the history
of Australia no one has more consistently bought the best of everything, regardless of cost;
and his well-known and justly-deserved character for fair dealing is sufficient to dispel any
doubt as to the figures submitted, or the descriptions given of the various prizes.
As it is confidently expected the whole amount will be readily subscribed, early appli-
cation is necessary.
All overflow money received will be placed in the £lOO,OOO Consultation on next
Melbourne Cup, so that those outside the colonies need not hesitate about remitting in the
usual way. The Distribution will be drawn under Mr. Adams’ personal supervision, and
in the presence of anv subscribers and the public, at Brisbane, Queensland, as soon as it is
filled.

“ It is lighter, clearer and more ethereal oil than
any I have hitherto used, besides being free from

sprayed into the throat.
“It is very palatable when taken internally,
which places it above other preparations, and con-

EXTRACTS
FROM
PRIVATE LETTERS.
“It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to toll you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘Benger's Food.' The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never he able to
rear her. We took her to the
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended 1 Benger's
Food.’ From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength.”
“If every mother knew of
its value no other would be
used.”
“Yes,” saida shipowner in conversation
with a passenger last week, “competition has
forced us to cut down passenger-rates all round
the coast, and every time we take a shilling off
you praise our public spirit and denounce other
companies that refuse to take a shilling off. Now,
why don’t you praise the other companies and
denounce us as blacklegs? When our men under-
cut that’s what you call them.”
In Westralia, the other day, a man out
back was relating to his blackboy the story of a
white N.S.W. bushman who, while timber-
splitting, got his hand jammed in a log, and how
awful evidence was left of the unavailing struggles
of the poor fellow, while dying of exhaustion, to
reach an axe, by which he might release himself.
The Westralian gave minute particulars to the
black savage, with the expectation that the latter
would evince some regret for the victim, or express
a wish that he had been on hand in time to avert
his fate. But what did the nigger say? Only
this: “By crikey, I s’pose that peller did
swear! ”
A sneak-thief fairly “diddled” a Melb.
policeman recently. The purloiner was just
emerging from a house with some flower-pots
under his arm when he ran into the officer who
enquired with a smile, “Phwat he was doin’
there?” With great presence of mind he replied
that he was taking his flower-pots to water at the
nearest horse-trough as his landlady would not
water them, and he had no time to do so as he was
studying all day. The guardian of the law walked
to the trough with him, walked back, and, as the
student walked up to the verandah, he went away
satisfied that it was all right. The sneak-thief
waited till he had gone, then put the door-mat
under his arm and cleared.

The acclimatised-fish question up to date.
Says Mr. Alex. Oliver, in S.M. Herald :
I do not think there is a Maoriland river that has not
been supplied with trout by the Acclimatisation Sociity,
which has been extremely generous and patriotic in
stocking their rivers. The principal trout they use is the
brown trout, and he gets an immense size, far larger than
in Britain, and is now becoming a salmon in his habits—
that is, he spends five-sixths of his time in the sea, which
is not what the brown trout does in Britain. Nine-tenths
of the trout in M.L. are the brown species. The
others are the “ rainbow trout,” and a few rivers
are stocked with the “brook trout,” and a few with
“Loch Leven trout.” It is about 100 to 1 when a man
catches a trout that it will be one of the brown variety.
They have grown so big that they have got beyond the
reach of the “ fly that is, the “fly” fisher cannot get
these fish, but the man with the artificial minnow can
catch them up to 201 b. From 121 b. to 151 b. are the com-
mon sizes to catch at the mouths of rivers and even
among the breakers. They are very often beautiful fish,
but, as a rule, the brown trout has not pink flesh, and is
“muddy.” In Lake Wakatipu they will not take bait,
and have to be caught by nets, but they are the best
tasting in M.L. These, also, are the brown trout. The
M.L. rivers have been so stocked with brown trout that it
is impossible to introduce any other, for the trout has
become cannibalistic, and devours all the weaker species.
The very curious fact is that the brown trout is evolving
himself into something that may become a salmon in
time. A good many scientific men are of opinion that it
may become a kind of M.L. salmon. As to salmon, they
have introduced many thousands of ova into the
likely rivers of the South Island, but the same
is true in regard to M.L. as in the case of
Tasmania. After leaving their nurseries the salmon
are not seen again. The fact is that these imported
salmon cannot live in salt water above 60 degrees,
and that temperature is, I think, probably fatal to the
salmon, so that when the fish gets down the rivers into
the “ parr ” state its instinct is to find salt water of a
temperature suitable to its development. Not finding it,
the fish goes south till it gets into currents or country
from which it never returns. No true salmon has ever
been found in Maoriland or Tasmania. The outcome of
my investigations is this : It is absolutely money wasted
to attempt to stock the Snowy River or any rivers of our-
with salmon ; but we may learn this lesson from Maoris
land-that if we want a big salmonoid the brown trout
will supply us with one.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page

WONDERFUL
Blood-Purifying Effect
-OF
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
Mr. Charles Stephenson, a well-known
Kailway Employd at Kalapoi,
New Zealand, writes;
“ About ten years ago, while engaged in
shunting, my foot caught between the rails,
and my leg was fractured below the knee.
It healed in time, but I have been troubled
ever since with swollen veins, and have been
obliged, at times, to wear a bandage. About
W
m
a year ago it became much worse, and I
feared I should be obliged to give up my
work. A friend advised me to try Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla. I did so, and after taking four
bottles the swelling disappeared, and I have
not been troubled with it since.’'

The very latest from Aafl “In Memoriatn ’

We ail stood around and knelt by the bed.

Last Wednesday the facts about the Fijian
hurricane— which were known in Australia weeks
a g o —seem to have reached London, and the intel-
ligent cable-man promptly wired them back_ as
entirely fresh news. This is the sort of thing
which makes Australia fully appreciate the advan-
tages of having a cable. Some day an interesting
murder in Sydney will be cabled to London,
and the overwhelming intellect at the other end
will cable it all back again for fear the people at
Redfern and Woolloomooloo haven’t heard about
it.
Rev. Wm. Gray, missionary of Tanna, on
the Kanaka trade; —“ By Regulation 20 no
islander who has agreed to come to Queensland
and who afterwards leaves the ship can be made
to come back by force. This is how it is managed.
‘ When a boy jumps overboard just take a boat
and pull ahead of him, then lie between him and
the shore. If lie has not tired himself swimming
and passes the boat, keep on heading him in the
same way. This dodge rarely fails.’ (Recipe by
Oapt. ). The married couples (emigrating)
known to me, were, with one exception, elope-
ments. There is always a friend at hand to act
the ‘chief ’ and give consent. Like the Chinaman,
the Kanaka has an intense longing to be buried
at home. Eleven thousand islanders have died in
Queensland.”
The “good old times” have evidently
shifted to Westralia. At Perth a grog-merchant
sued a lawyer for <£6o worth of dishonored
cheques. The cheques had not come direct from
the lawyer, but through a lady, who, according to
plaintiff, kept a “ boarding-house,” where they
consumed as much as £55 worth of liquor in one
week. Some of the peroxided “young lady
boarders” ordered goods from this confiding
tradesman, who fulfilled the order and said in
Court that he “had no curiosity about Mrs. C.’s
business.” When defendant was in the box he
stated that he was drunk when he signed the
cheques, and that he was more or less drunk when,
on the advice of a friend, he went to try to get’
some of them back again. Then the hospitable
Mrs. 0. gave him more grog, and he faintly
remembered giving “Nellie” and “Minnie ’
cheques; then he became “silly and delirious.”
Altogether there are joyous times to the fore in
Perth.

The very latest swindle. A confiding

country town :
Editor Bulletin, — Would you kindly oblige by letting
me know at your earliest convenience who is the com-
poser of the recitation entitled “The Burglar; or The
Ceckney Knobsman?” A professional actor named
, lately visiting this town, sold the right
to recite it to me for a certain sum of money. He also
told me that he composed it, and that your proprietary
bought the right to publish it, some little time back. The
recitation contains seven verses or 191 lim s. I am lead
to believe that he is not the composer, and, therefore, had
no right to sell it to me. The copy in my possession
bears the number (Ner. 247). Hoping you will he pleased
to give the informalion to me.—Yours, &c., W.T.D.
N.B.—When gave account of the recita-
tion he told me not to lose the copy. Afraid your paper
would prosecute me for reciting it as you bought the
right.
If the innocent Mr. W.T.D. can prove his state-
ments the police should be put on the track of
Mr. Blank Blank, who is quite unknown at this
s ffioe.

Mr. Airy Donnel, a squatter’s son, was coming
to town by train. At one of the stations a sharper
dropped in, and suggested 3d. Nap to kill time. The
game ran level till they were about half-an-hour from the
city, when the raagsman suggested higher stakes for the
final flatters. Airy agreed, and the stranger dealt him
ace, king, queen, jack of diamonds and ace of hearts,
reserving himself five diamonds, so as to pip Airy on the
last trick when he declared nap. The youth cried nap,
and offered to bet a sov. he would get through. Sharp
said he would lay a tenner he would not, and, after some
talk, it ended in £2O level being laid about it. Airy led
the ace of hearts; the other, of course, could not follow
suit, and the rest of his cards were too low to touch
Airy’s. The shark handed over the stakes and inquired
where the youth learnt the game. He explained that the
tutor on his father’s station was a graduate of a Scotch
university on the theological side.

The first Maori “ sport ” the present writer met
was a chieftainess of the Thames district, one Mary
Taipari. Mary’s husband was a mild old rangatira
who disapproved of horse-racing, and wore a billy-
hat and a frock-coat. But Mary had a strong
will and a private income, and she bought a roach-
backed stallion of uncertain age named Potentate.
First time he ran in Mary’s colors the fair owner climbed
on top of the judge’s box and performed an incantation,
supposed to have the virtue of imparting stamina and
speed, and then descended to put on her bit with a faith
that the result did not warrant, for poor old Potentate
finished nearer last than first. The jockey (a white)
didn’t weigh in —Mary didn’t give him a chance, for, sum-
moning some members of her tribe, she chased the
unhappy w retch up and down the course, and eventually
soothed her feelings by pulling out a handful of his
whiskers. ’

The Southern civil-servant who has invented
the “revolutionary ’’ bicycle,” also lately got provisional
protection for an improved mud-guard that, in addition
to avoiding the old nuisance—the hosing of the rider with
mud—will have its V-shaped surface so presented that
the front guard will divide the air-currents during pro-
pulsion and the back guard will give the machine extra
velocity. The original machine built for trial purposes
has been broken up, and the sanguine inventor says he
would not take £300,000 cash down for his inventions.

“ During past football seasons down South tne
crack player,” says a Bulletin correspondent, “ was, as a
rule, a demigod to whom the mad crowd bowed down.
To know and speak to the (treat man was an honor—l°
drink with hi.m a privilege reserved for none save the
illustrious. He drank and cursed and never worked, had
his buggy to take him to and from the ground, and his
man to dress and rub him down. As a rule he was a low-
looking ruffian with close-cropped head and a clean shave.
Yet one quiet-looking little man used to take the tram,
pay his fare, go down to the ground without any fuss,
lead his fourth year’s champions into the field, and take
no notice of the 2p,000 mad fools who roared themselves
hoarse. And when it was over the little man smiled at
the struggling hero-worshippers, went home, put on his
apron, sold His meat, and told the smallest barracker how
the big match was won. He played for the love of the
game, and it’s a pity he has retired. I allude to Alick
Dick, captain of the Essendon Football Club.” The Bul-
letin most respectfully salutes demigod Dick. It was
indeed most condescending for such a potentate not to
put his hat on with a shoe-horn.

Some Vie. civil servants, writes a Bulletin cor-

during Government time, make from £lO to £l2 books ©n
all principal race meetings. One decided sport, however,
does the thing properly. For years past he has been
publicly running £250 sweeps. Last year was his record,
as he raked in his 10 per cent, on eight such sweeps. In
addition to this, a suburban hotel, in his wife’s name, has
the benefit of his enterprising management.

hacked and wealthy William has always insisted that his
horses belonged strictly to himself, and chat anyone who
chose to hack one of his neddies did not thereby acquire
any sort of a partnership in the animal of his fancy.

Summonses were served on two members of
the Victorian Club for betting on the stairs, and one
bookmaker w-as prosecuted. His counsel argued that
the Gaming Act was “simply intended to apply to persons
who were the owners, occupiers, or habitual frequenters
of premises for; the purposes of betting.” Clearly a
member of the Victorian Club is apart owner and habitual
frequenter for the purposes of betting, but the Bench dis-
missed the case after hearing a number of English prece-
dents. English precedents!
If a Melbourne bookmaker mustn’t ply his pencil
at any particular point of the V.C. premises, he’s
not entitled to bet at Flemington paddock. Just here
The Bulletin rises to ask why the V.R.C. or any other
racing-club is allowed to “ license ” bookmakers to bet
on the very ground where it can’t license a tote to do
the same thing? W'hy, in the name of moral decency, is
Parliament even asked for an opinion re the machine whilst
the human odds-iayer is a racecourse law unto himself?
And how would the law regard an enterprising Hebrew
who started to bet all fair, square and abovehoard, upon
the totalisator principle with a hook and pencil ? The
principle can be worked without a machine at all.
Then Sam Winter was prosecuted for publish-
ing, inMelb. Sportsman, “an advertisement setting forth
that a certain place known as the Victorian Club was
used for the purpose of making wagers.” Winter’s
counsel held that nobody on readinj the adet. could infer
that the club was used for purposes of betting. Then
bookmaker Jack Cohen was called to explain his advt.,
but Winter’s counsel objected to his evidence, and the
case was dismissed. Thus the farce proceeds from year
to year, the police (or Crown) pretending to have serious
intentions of asserting an insincere Law, and the Law
holding itself up to contempt. Thtsordlnary daily news-
paper report of overnight odds at the club doesn’t prove
that the place is a betting establishment. Not at all. As
far as the Law can understand, the club may be a house 6f
prayer.

The fiasco of the starting-machine at Caulfield
exactly carries out the prediction of Its enemies. Just
imagine the affair occurring over the Melb. Cup, with a
horse of Patron’s calibre left fresh to run the race over
again 1
• * * *
The false start at Caulfield could have been pre-
vented by the expedient of stationing a man with a red
flag about a furlong from the starting-post. If a false
start occurred, the man in charge of the machine w,ould
shake his red flag at the advance agent, who would then
stand on the track and wave the field back.

It would surprise some people if they knew how
few of the leather-lunged fraternity own the books they

There are “ millions in it ” if you are so lucky as
to have a decent connection. It is not so long since that,

One who should know declares that of all the

A man of “ sterling worth ”
You twig one day, ere it sails away,
About to find his berth ;

Being far from strong. You know what’s wrong—

Ere off he goes ; one eye we close—

Westward, westward, for ever westward,
The hurrying feet of the toilers pass ;
They will not wait in the flower-grown meadows,
They will not rest in the long lush grass,
But still press on for the arid deserts
’Neath skies that burn like a shield of brass.
Westward, westward, for ever westward,
Our loved ones leave us to join the throng;
They will not stay tho’ our arms are round them,
Their hearts are filled with the Syren song
That tells of gold in the lone land hidden
For saint or sinner, for weak or strong.
Westward, westward, for ever westward,
With fierce eyes fixed on tho phantom gold,
Although their feet through the hot sand passing
May tread on bones that are bleached and old :
The Syren Song is of those who conquer
And not of hearts that are still and cold.
Westward, westward, for ever westward,
The weird song floats on the burning air ;
It does not tell of the shining metals,
* It only whispers of long gold hair,
The sunny tresses of white-armed women !
The dead sea-fruit that is wondrous fair.
Westward, westward, for ever westward,
With words of promise like liquid fire,
That stir the blood ot the dreaming people
And speak to each of his heart’s desire,
Till sombre eyes are ablaze with passion,
And dead hopes rise from their funeral pyre.
Westward, westward, for ever westward,
The song floats by with its wild refrain ;
Madly the echoes mock, exulting
In ghastly tribute of heart and brain ;
But the Syren’s arms are for ever empty.
She sings—and then they are filled again.

ETHEL MILLS.
In My Theatre,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It costs only shoe-leather ; but the play goes on
continually and the artists are all stars. I have
spent hours watching this drama of the streets,
but the little girl on the step outside the fruit-shop
amused me best. She sold papers and—was the
most accomplished actress I have ever seen. The
electric-light shone full on her, and behind was a
mirror, so that both aspects of the poor, thin dress
could be seen at once.
I first noticed her having a row with a boy who
had been attempting to sell his papers on her
preserve-. Site drove him into the gutter and
across tiie street till he was glad to be allowed
the opposite corner, and he never poached again.
For whenever she chose to be angry her voice
and vocabulary were dreadful. But whenever she
chose to be otherwise—the same voice, with a
different vocabulary, was heart-breaking in its
pathos. And her eyes—naturally dimmed with
the taint of the streets—could melt pity and
pennies from the hardest cynic who once gazed
into them.
One evening an old gentleman stopped to speak
to her. He asked about her circumstances and was
very compassionate. There were not only the
peaked face and tender eyes to impress him, but
the pronounced shoulder-blades shivering in the
mirror behind as well.
“ Mother’s sick and I’ve two kiddies—young
sisters to keep, and father’s in the ’orsepital ”
“ My poor child !”
“ And then a poor g-y-url has no show, ’cos the
boys bullies yer so, and people don’t buy evenink
papers now like they used to. There was a time
when kind gentlemen, sir, used to gimme thrip-
pences for ’ERALps and let me keep the change,
but now .... Wot are ye givin’us ?”
“This ticket will admit you to an entertain-
ment in aid of the United Christian Endeavour
Association to-morrow night at eight o’clock, and
mind you ”
“ Strike-me-never !—and nothink else ?”
“There’s tea after the address, and the sisters
will take your name, and you will be entered on
the register.”
“Well, I’m blowed!—you bloomin’ fraud-
clear !”
“ My child !”
“ Ain’t yer child, and if I was I’d be ashamed
of me mother. Go on ; git out ! You’re interfer-
in’ with a respectable woman’s business.”
“But” —
“If you don’t skedaddle, ole Alleluia, I’ll give
yer in charge for insultin’ a female. Garn !”
He did—for he had heard of the flogging clauses
in the Crimes Act—while the girl repeated the
tale to the boy, who had come over to listen.
“ I thought I’d ’ooked a softy-softy, but ’e only
guv me this—rot ’im ! Look out, Billy, ’ere’s the
theatre push, and I hain’t done nothink to-night—
’Erald, sir—Won’t you buy the last one, sir—
’Erald, sir, ’Erald?”
« # •
Some time after this I was with a friend who
acts on a stage, and I said, “Come with me and
I’ll show you a better Camille than Bernhardt’s,”
and, while we were walking up the street, I told
him about my paper girl.
“ We’ll watch her from the other side—but no
—see !—she has started already and that’s her
latest.”
She was leaning back against a corner of the
wall in a wearied exhausted sleep, and we crossed
over.
“She can drop into it at a moment’s notice.
Look at the hang of that lip—isn’t it perfect!
Oh, I say, old man, keep a sympathetic face or
she’ll see it’s no good.”
Certainly it was perfect. The little head rest-
ing in the fluting of the pillar, the open palm
hanging limply over the edge of the step, were
very convincing.
“ Poor child, doesn’t she do it well ?” I said, in-
tending her to hear it, and so provoke her Billings-
gate.
My friend gently touched her.
“Lookout, old man-she has claws. Hallo!
she is asleep—catch her !”
“ You fool! She’s dead !”

Mis Luck.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is a demi-monde of men as well as of
women, and the riches of romance are more
varied therein. The Devil is more interesting
than his dam.
Like the women, the men employ the whole
gamut of explanation. The prosperous boldly
declare that they chose their life because they
could see that it was the game that paid best. It
is only with the unsuccessful that explanation
turns to excuses. Then women and wine are
blamed, and the treachery of fellow-men; while the
philosophic account for everything by a compre-
hensive “ Kismet!”
The Big ’Un was a philosopher, and his name for
malignant Destiny was “My luck.” “It
was my luck that brought me to this !” he
would exclaim as he mechanically rigged invisible
thimbles on the table, or manipulated shadowy
cards. “ The year Sardius won the Ad’laide Cup.
Rec’lect? Well, I was a butcher then. Didn't
do a bad business, either.”
Then he would bite a quid from a cake of
tobacco and cogitatively roll it around in his
mouth. “One evenin',” he would resume, “a
pal of mine come into the shop with a scared look
on ’is face an’ ’e ses : ‘Big ’Un, the Kid’s gone an’
done it!’
“ ‘ Gone an’ done what ?’ ” ses I.
“ ‘ Why, robbed the bloomin’ bank,’ ses ’e.
“For a couple of jiffs I said nuthin’, but just
chewed over an idea that ’ad struck me. Then I
ses to Lawson—-my pal, you know —‘Just ’old on
a bit.’ Then I went into the back and come out
with a ’arf bottle of brandy. ‘Now,’ ses I, ‘ come
up-stairs.’ And up we goes. ‘Sit down!’ I ses,
‘ and ’ev’ a drink an’ listen to what I’ve got to
say.’
“We took a swig each. Then ses I, * Bob, this
is the chance of our life !’
“ ‘ What ?’ ’e ses, ‘ the Kid’s bit of snickin’ ?’
“ ‘ Yes !’ I ses, ‘ the Kid’s bit of snickin’. Just
you listen to me. We know, don’t we,’ I ses,
‘that Sardius is a cert, for the Cup. Well, the
Kid ’asn’t been dropt to yet, and ’e ’as only got
one chance.’
“ ‘ Well, spit it out,’ ses Bob.
“ ‘E must, ses I, ‘get old of all the stuff ’e can
an’ back Sardius. If ’e wins ’e can put every-
thing back. ‘lf ’e loses e’ won’t be any worse off
than ’e is now an’ can clear out.’
“ Bob said nothin’. ’E just shook my flipper
an’ took another brandy.
“ Well, to cut it short, the Cup was run a couple
of days after, an’ it was arranged that the Kid was
to meet me on the course with the stuff. I was
there to time, an’ ’e come up soon after.
“ ‘ Well,’ ses I, ‘ ’ev’ yer got the stuff ? ”
“ For answer ’e just clapped’s ’and on each of
’is pockets—’is trousers, ’is breast and’s side kicks.
They was ail bulged out.
“‘What are they?’ ses I, taken aback.
‘Fivers?’
“ ‘Tenners,’ he ses, ‘ an’ ponies ! ’
“ My Gord ! ’ ses I.
“Well, we met Bob a little after, and between
us got about four ’undred on our ’orse. We let
the Kid take the wagers ’cos ’e wasn’t known, an’
at the finish we stood to win about three thou.
“ When the race came on I was excited. My
oath ! Me an’ the Kid stood together in front of
the Stand, but Bob ’ung off with a petticoat ’e
’ad ’ooked onto.
“At last they started. I stood just be’ind the
Kid lookin’ over ’is ’ead an’ followin’ the race with
the glasses. Sardius was goin’ as good as could
be, an’ gettin’ a nice place at the turn, an’ the
crowd was singin’ out ‘Sardius! Sardius!’ ’E
come up the straight dancin’ in, an’ 1 saw that it
was all over, when suddenly the Kid falls in a
’cap at me feet, an’ in a couple of shakes two
blokes was on his chest.
“‘The cops!’ ses I to myself, an’ quietly
slipped away. I went to find Bob to tell ’im, but
couldn’t see ’im nowhere.
“My mind was in a state, my oath! because,
you see, the Kid ’ad all the tickets.”
At this point the Big Un would mop the per-
spiration from his forehead.
“ Well, I ’ung round for a bit an’ then thought
I would just quietly get back an’ see ’ow things
was goin’. I worked through cunnin’-like, an’
when I got to where we was standin’ what do yon
think I sees? Why, the bloomin’ Kid a-standin’
there as calm an’ unconcerned as if nothin’ ’ad
’appened.
“ ‘ Hello,’ I ses, ‘ didn’t yer get nicked ? ’
“ 1 Nicked ? No ! ’ ses ’e; ‘ I never.got nicked !’
“ ‘ Well, what was yer doin’ on the ground with
them two blokes on yer chest? ’ ses I.
“ ‘O, that? ’ ses he ; ‘ they said I ’ad a fit.’
“ ‘ You wouldn’t believe what a weight that took
off my mind,’ the Big ’Un would feelingly
remark while he wiped some more perspiration.
“‘Well, come on,’ I ses; ‘let’s go an’collect
the stuff. Where’s the tickets ?’
“’E put ’s ’ands in ’is kicks, first in one an’
then another. Then ’e looked in ’is ’at, an’ in the
end took off ’is boots an’ looked in them, but there
wasn’t no bloomin’ tickets anywhere. I got a bit
scared.
“ ‘ Ain’t yer got ’em?’ ses I.
“ ‘ I dunno,’ ses ’e, ’is voice shakin’.
“ ‘ Come on, now,’ I ses, suspectin’ funny busi-
ness ; no b y kid !
“ ‘ I ain’t kiddin, s’elp me Gord !’ ’e ses.
“ ‘Then where’s the tickets?’ I ses.
“‘ I dunno,’ ses ’e; ‘ the blokes must ’ave taken
’em when I was in the fit.’
“‘An’ so the ’ad,’ the Big ’Un would
conclude. ‘lt was just my luck!’”
* • #
As a sequel to this recital, he subsequently
added that he had found out the whole thing
was a game played off on him by the Kid and
“that Bob.”
“I might ’ave known,” he whimpered, “that
the little nipper wasn’t subject to fits. It was just
my luck!”

But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-
eminence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston,
a resident and practitioner at 121 Coliins-street, Mel-
bourne. His name has become almost literally a house-
hold word; almost every other man you meet has a
wonderful story to relate of some almost miraculous cure
he has performed in ans acute or chronic case of long
standing, where other physicians have failed. He ad-
dresses himself in particular to cases that have baffled the
skill and science of other doctors. His name is a suffi-
cient guarantee of a perfect cure of every case he under-
takes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to
your life.

ing dreams, unrefreshing sleep, a tired gloomy feeling and

single life; if you are suffering from these or similar symp-
toms you know the cause. Do not allow false pride and
sham modesty to deter you in seeking relief. Before it is
everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, andean treat
