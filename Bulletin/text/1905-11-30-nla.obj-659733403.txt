AUSTRALIA N WRITERS AND AN ENG-
LISH CRITIC
A N Eng. literary "journal, The Academy, re-
/% cently printed such an unexpected criti-
cism of A Southern Garland, that it
seemed worth while asking the authors
of that book for commentary ; and their remarks
here follow the reprinted notion. The Latin
primer’s dictum holds still : Britannia cst insula:
the-Englishman is insular. He rarely compre-
hends that “the colonies ” *are in some ways
better Britains than the one he inhabits. The
Australian or Canadian, as a strange monster,
is a subject for English enthusiasm and praise;
because one ipay defer politely to his monstrous
standards; omitting to stress English superiority
in view of “the colonies’” admitted usefulness.
Considered as an inferior Englishman, it is pain-
fully evident that the Australian or Canadian is
“ un-English,” - and on the occasions of his public
appearance he should be kept in his inferior place :
not because he can be proved inferior, but because,
coming from “ the colonies,” that must be taken
for granted. Between kindly arid unkindly
patronage “the colonies” may take the choice
that is given them.
The Academy reviewer has found a third atti-
tude : one of mild wonder that the “colonial”
monster does not come up to legitimate English
expectation. Most people in England know that
Australia is a kind of No-Man’s Land somewhere
on the outskirts of . earth, where a hardy bar-
baric, population of doubtful colour and antece-
dents ekes out a rather precarious living by herd-
ing sheep against the attacks of the wild kangaroos.
But here is Orson writing poetry ! poetry dis-
tinguishable only from English minor verse oy
the fact that some of it is a good deal
better than current English minor verse.
Can such things be and co-exist with one’s
notion of “the colonies”? No-; emphatically.
The Academy feels all a boy’s natural disappoint-
ment when the circus does not reach the level of
the posters. It is “another injustice to” England.
What is to become of the British Constitooshn,
Magna Charta, and a man’s right to w-hack his
lawful wife, if these things are permitted? “The
colonies ” must adjust themselves better to the
eternal fitness of things and notions English.—One
can only suggest that a new habit of the “grand
tour ” be instituted in Great Britain ; and that
English adolescents should be brought round “ the
colonies ” to see the difference between facts
and the British imagination of facts. (Lord
Salisbury’s goldfields experience, remember, col-
oured for a generation Eng. policy to Aus-
tralia.) Yet “the colonies” are doubtfully worth
so 'much trouble. It is easier to rest on the
grand old precedents that have made the Empire
what it is. Let us rather reform “ the colonies.”
Nolumus mentes Angliae mutari!
All which, of course, need not prevent one from
acknowledging, with others, the kindly spirit of
The Academy’s criticism, in happy contrast to the
perfunctory or malicious notices of Australian
books occasionally vouchsafed by the English
press. “Don’t snoot the pianist! He’s doing
bis best.”
Crabbed Age and Youth.
A Southern Garland. (Sydney: The Bulletin News-
paper Cos., 4s. 6 d. net.)
The Sydney Bulletin has reprinted in one
volume a series of “Bulletin Booklets” which
contained some of the poems contributed by
certain Australian poets to that paper. In this
volume we find five poets,: Mr. Roderic Quinn,
Mr. James Hebblethwaite, Miss t Louise Mack,
Mr. Hubert Church, and Mr. Bernard O’Dowd.
In view of. the criticism we have to offer, it may
be of interest to state that of these five one, Mr.
Hebblethwaite, was born in England, and emi-
Sated when adult; three others, Mr. Quinn,
r. Church, and Mr. O’Dowd were born in Aus-
tralia or Tasmania of parents who had emigrated
from England or Ireland ; and one, Miss Louise
Mack, was born in Tasmania of a father and
mother who had emigrated from Germany and
from Ireland respectively. All of them, that is,
belong almost as much to the old world as to the
new: they are not so completely eoio&ial as to
make their poems fairly representative of the
poetry of the colonies.
We have heard, and have been delighted to
hear, that poetry is widely read in Australia ;
that, where it commands a limited sale among a
cultivated few in England, it reaches all classes in
city and country in her daughter-land. And
we opened this book, therefore, in the natural hope
of finding—what the lover of poetry is always
hoping for—&ume sign of new- worlds to be con-
quered or being conquered, some new note ; some
difference, in fact, promising further amplification,
from the old forms and thoughts of poetry which
not a few hold to have done all they can in the old
world. We were prepared for rugged ness—even
fftr the formlessness of Whitman ; for simplicity—
and we even hoped for the grand simplicity of
Homer or the old English ballads ; at any rate for
something that should prove a looking forward—a
forgetting of the old arid worn—not a looking back
to models and methods which have done the utmost
'that can be expected of them.
What we did not anticipate was meriiory, form,
and accomplishment; and these are the very
qualities that are most marked in the book before
us. These five singers sing not as birds sing or as
children sing, with a complete unconsciousness of
form and method, with an ebullience which might
grow some day into anew and natural poetry;
but,with all the art, the memory, the accomplish-
ment of the singers of the' old world. Take a few
verses from Mr. O’Dowd, who, fierce Irish Radi-
cal as he is, hates the old world, and has his eyes
ever on the new. What is his poetry ? A long
reminiscence; a thing of allusion and recollection,
not the original “careless” bird-notes of an
unpremeditated rapture,
What is that but reminiscence, a recall of the old
learning of the old world ? Its ruggedness is not
the freedom • of rapture, but the result of too
crammed a memory and too allusive a mind.
There are twenty more such allusions in the poem
from which we quote it. It might have been the
work of some soured old misanthrope in an effete
despotism, instead of that of a young man in a
new country. For all the hope of its message, its
poetry—and we are only concerned here with
poetry—is effete, not promise-crammed, but
emptied of promise. One and all of our poets are
too full of the old learning. Mr. Church has a
dog called Tasso !
Here and there, indeed, in these Australian
-pages, we come upon downright decadence. Mr.
Quinn, in “Derelict,” paints a portrait of a
•drunken old artist, which, were it French, any
poet of Montmartre might be proud to sign ; and
his “Love’s Legacy ” has all the age of the old
world in its subject, the perfect restraint and
polish of its form, and the cynical shrug at the
end of it :
The author of that is a poet; but not the poet for
whom we look, and shall continue to look, to
Australia;, the new land. The sadness of the old
world is there, and something of the artistic per-
fection with which the old world tries to turn its
sadness into a thing of delight. It is not the
poetry of youth, of hope and freedom.
Our disappointment rises, indeed, not from any
lack of skill and beauty that we find in this
volume, but from the fact that these poets are too
accomplished. There is a charm and delicacy
about the work of all of them, except that of Mr.
O’Dowd, a dainty lyrical beauty that makes them
precious.
So sings Mr. Church in his part of the work, which
is called “The West Wind,” and there is nothing
perhaps fresher and sweeter in the whole volume
than this poem; but it is an accomplished, a
sophisticated freshness; it is poetry of the town,
not of the country. And though there are in the
work of all these poets (except, perhaps, that of
Mr. Hebblethwaite, whose eyes and heart are
always set on the land he has left) no small amount
of “ local colour,” full evidence that their country
is not England but Australia, and ,a certain use,
too, of words with a kind of freedom that gives
them an un-English flavour, yet we miss any fur-
ther definitely Australian characteristics than
these. Miss Louise Mack loves Sydney arid
writes of -it, in her vigorous rapid verse, with
enthusiasm and pride; but she writes of it just as
an Englishwoman might write of her home in the
British Isles.
The work of the cultivated poets of Australia,
as this volume is amply sufficient to prove, is
good. When we know it better, we shall find it a
valuable addition to the lyrical beauties in the
English language. But what are the uncultivated
poets of Australia doing, or what have they done
m the past ? Were there no bushmen, untutored,
perhaps, but poets by right of their genuine, deep
feeling, who made songs by their camp-fires in the
wilderness; no gold-diggers who turned to song
some features of the hot and crowded hours of life
about them? If such poets there were—and
surely there must have been—the Sydney Bulletin,
which has done interesting service to literature
by the publication of this volume, would do well,
by collecting and editing them, to give readers in
England a chance of making acquaintance.
It is, we fancy, from such rough, natural and
simple poetry as this that the characteristic Aus-
tralian poetry for which we look will trace its
descent.
—From The Academy, Sept. 9.
*• The prognathous Neanderthal,
To them conceals the Bruce ;
They see Dan Eh - )p in the thrall;
From swagmen Christ deduce.
“ They Jesus find in manger waif:
In horse-boys Shgkespearhood :
A id earthquake-Luthers nestling safe
In German miner’s brood.”
“ The light upon her cheek

_ The lips whereof you speak
Are not for lovers’ lips.
“ The wherefore and the why
Make men and maidens weep ;
Gold lights of hair and eye
Grey grow in endless sleep.
“ A flower is she indeed,
A lily-chalice pale,
But evil was the seed
Whence sprung a growth so frail.
“ The debts we pile to-day
They pay in ceaseless tears —
With streaming eyes they pay
The score in after-years.
“ Who should not meet have met.
They sin—the world rolls on l
Bust all, except the debt;
Who pays ? She dies anon."
“ Rosalind has come to town !
All the street’s a meadow,
Balconies we beeches brown
With a drowsy shadow,
And the longglrdivn window panes
Are the foliage of her lanes.
"Rosalind about me brings
Sunny brooks that quiver
Unto palpitating wings
Ere they kiss the river,
And her eyes are trusting birds
That do, nestle -without words.”
Roderic Quinn writes:
The Academy’s appeal for a rough, simple, natural
Australian poet is not likely to fall on answering soil in
our times. Australia has 'never yet produced a rough,
simple, natural poet. Her condition from the first made
his advent .doubtful. Although she possessed, and
possesses, a pioneering population, she did not evolve her
civilisation. It came to her from England and Europe,
in ships and along the submarine cable. It is only when
a race begins to shed the shaggy skins of barbarism, and
to don the tailor-made clothes of Civilisation, that the
rough, simple, natural singer gets his chance.
What Australia wants is not less art, but more art.
Poetic methods and forms which have stood the test of
centuries, from Dan Chaucer to Tennyson, are good
enough for the Australian singer. He would not be
likely to profit greatly,by a departure from them. Whit-
man’s lack of art does not enhance his poetic value. As
said on this page recently, he is read in spite of his uncouth
measures—not because of them ; but, if he had adopted
the same sweet forms and methods which great poets
created and used, his appeal would have been to a wider
and less astonished circle. The Academy critic, with the
sated palate of the intellectual Englishman, may have
grown tired of the slim, smooth, symmetrical glass from
which he has been privileged to drain peerless wine, but
if Australia were to offer hirii his desire—•crude vintage in
a jagged vessel—it would cut his mouth and set his teeth
on edge.
Australia has no new point of view to offer, because, in-
tellectually considered, Australia is not a new country,
but only an old country transplanted. All the Australian
poet’s peculiar environment permits him to do is to give
a new setting to an ancient theme. Of themselves the
swagman and the digger are not poetic subjects. It is
only when they love or hate, weep or laugh, that they
become such. It is not the atmosphere, but the man
whom it surrounds that the true poet tries most intensely
to depict. If the atmosphere should be that of a gold-
field, or of‘ a camp-fire, so much the better. Let him
write his poem, but let him write it to the utmost of his
art.
&
Jas. Hebulethwaite writes from The Rectory,
Georgetown, Tas. : ...... ...
In The Academy review there is the old courtliness,
the old beautiful phrasing; i.e., “forgetting .of the old
and worn,” “ a long reminiscence ” ; but not the oia in-
sight. And I for one am deeply thankful for its courtesy,
especially after recent English criticism of Australian
literature and politics. Once I was waiting for the tram,
and an old Irish lady came up to me and begged. I gave
her sixpence. A few moments afterwards she came again
and asked for more. “But I have just given you six-
pence,” I said. “Hush!” she replied, “no gentleman
talks of past kindness.” Under such perfect tuition, 1
can no more than murmur “ Ancient kindness benefits
forgot,” and express a sincere wish that our English
brethren would at least try to understand us.
The Academy critic writes as a gentleman, and after
the expression of spite and ignorance recently quoted as
a final judgment on our verse, it is refreshing to read his
review :it is consoling. But he is disappointed because
he does not get “ ruggedness.” (So is “ the man in the
street ” because we are not black.) What have “ rugged-
ness ” and “ local colour ”to poetry ? He goes on
to complain that we do not *give the simplicity, the
unconsciousness, of the old ballads. Now I learnt from
The Academy long ago (or I think I did) that poetry was
the perfect expression of deep emotion, a delicate crea-
tion ; and also that until we could regain the inner state
and the environment of, say, the writer of “The Wife of
Usher’s Well,” we must not expect another ballad of such
tragic simplicity. But the Australian consciousness and
environment are infinitely more modern English than
mediaeval! The critic expects an impossibility.
What do we want ? Let me quote from my own
writing on the Red Page. “It is in the contemplation
of that which is waning, of the evanescent, that the
modern poet finds his inspiration and song. There is
infinite pathos in the very presept death of parting, and
in the passing away of that which is young and beautiful.
Perhaps, when the brotherhood of man is recognised as a
glorious and simplifying fact, our singers will leave
sorrow and sighing and strike a lofty note of hope and
joy.” What do we want ? In song and in politics young
Australia is striving to realise the Brotherhood of Man,
and we want our English brothers to sympathise with
our endeavour.
What do we want ? Just sympathetic judgment. For
myself ! love the Past—goldened by Time made piteous.
I want a critic who can enter into my sense of exile, who
can estimate the dignity of the object of my desire, my
capacity for passion, and my power of expression. On
these he must base his judgment of my “making,”
Whether adverse or otherwise it does not really matter —
justness is the thing.
And my love includes a passion for my old home.
Like a wave of the tea that floods and breaks in falling,
My heart flows to thee, 0 England of my dream,
Floods and breaks with a cry when I hear thy voices calling,
And see in the spring light thy wet woodlands gleam.
Here in this pleasant isle I rest from my sad roaming,
Soft is the wind and green and Sweet the earth ;
But it is not the land where I tvould fain be homing,
. Whose dust and whose passion came forth at my birth.
But it is not the England of to-day. It is the England
of the dream : a land of blowing woods and golden brooks ;
of a rustic greyness and sweetness of life hinted at in the
old engravings in wood and steel, and embalmed in cer-
tain verses of the Elegy.
My ideal critic must love these things with me —and
then judge. Yet lam glad that The Academy speaks of
us kindly-like.
Hubert Church:
It is a pleasant article to read. But the writer expect*
too- much from us. Is Australasian literature to be
judged on the lines of Australasian cricket? Are our
poets to astonish an effete old world with new discoveries
in the manner of Mr. Spofforth and Mr. Trumper? Again,
are we to march into the arena bearing boomerangs,
waddies (or, if Maorilanders, meres), clad in opossum-
skins, gibbering? I think not. Must we smell of the
soil, like a gin ? As well ask for the unities of time and
space. The reviewer has looked into the book to find
what does not exist—an Australian spirit. There is as
yet no Australian nation (the more the pity) ; we have no
history that we care to fondle in memory. Our past was
a fond imitation of panem et circenses; we have had a
good time. Literature is now being born among us ; and
the first comers grope their way feebly. No patron stands
beside our cradle to endow us munificently. Like the
coneys, we are a feeble folk.
I take leave to doubt if poetry is, the best medium
for describing the early days of our nation in the
forming. The “humours” of camp-life, of the
gold-fields, of the shearing-shed, of cattle-droving,
and so forth, surely they develope themselves with
a finer outline under the hand of the writer of short
stories and satire. What has poetry to do with them ?
Australian authors, Vot to be named here, have done this
kind of work very skilfully in verse, but the result was
not poetry. Could a Milton, a Wordsworth, enthrall us
with poems on such subjects ? We have given some signs
of new worlds to be conquered. We do not say we have
entered them ;we try to lead thither. We have what
Jeremy Taylor calls “the tendencies to glorjn” We write
about our country because we love it. In a dim way we
know that there is a glory undiscoverable to our eyes,
that shall be plain to our successors. Meantime we do
our best. Can anyone give us the simplicity of Homer ?
I look into Matthew Arnold’s Essay On translating
Homer , and I find he says that Homer’s simplicity can be
no more. It is an uncopyable antique.
Again, who are the writers of merit who write with an
unconsciousness of form and method ? What is the good
work done that way ? Anyone behind the poetic scenes
knows that good literature is not made thus. Truly,
we belong to the old world as much,as to the new. Why
not? We were fed in our youth on the old-world writers.
We never heard of any others till we were adults. How
can we write in a way different from the way of the men
whose writings were our daily food when we were young ?
As well ask us to turn Buddhists. If Miss Mack writes of
Sydney like an Englishwoman would write of the British
Islands, it is quite' natural. Reactive, philosophic verse
is of no country. It is everywhere naturalised ; free of
all charter. If 'an Australian poet meditat s deeply on
the forces of life, and pictures them as he Sees them—if
he does this pointedly, essentially, truly, all the time with
the high music that charmed Milton, Wordsworth, Brown-
ing, let us not ask why he did not leap into the arena with
a corroboree.
Bernard O’Dowd:
My answer to much said by the critic will, I am sure,
be realised by him himself when he has time to carefully
read A Kevnote,” and when he also realises that my
verses in Dawmvard i are mainly destructive, destructive
of the evil features (if anything is evil) of gur bourgeois
social system, as “ effete ” and dangerous a “ despotism ”
as ever afflicted man. In that sense I claim to be a poet,
in (not “ of ”)an “ effete civilisation,” whose “ effeteness,”
hearsay had led me to believe, should also have been
fairly evident even to our critic. Another obvious answer
to th ■ whole article is that verse of good quality claims to
be j .isessed by virtue of that quality, not on what a
chance critic however able wants to see come from “the
colonies,” but on its note of universality. That is the
time-test, and is also, with the additional quality of
originality of idea (so singularly overlooked in that
article), the principal factor in judging verses from the
point of view of absolute poetry.
I don’t think, oh the whole, that the critic has dealt
broad-mindedly with any of the writers in A Southern
Garland, and I hope such a key as he has chosen is not,
for the sake of the future of English criticism, common in
review circles there. In any case, his theory of poetry
runs counter to the best traditions of English literature
in England itself, and is certainly violently at variance
with the teaching of men of the type of Professor Tucker
here. While I think the new: country will and should
produce new poems, and from new points of view, they
'1 not be poetry at all if they are “ colonial,” or if they
Wk the universal note or originality of idea.
Finally, in my opinion thought is a more important
element in the valuation of absolute poetry than form or
melody : form as an end, and melody as an end, have
resulted in both local and English sterilisation: and
originality of thought ( i.e., inspiration + “ essential brain
work ”) must come • brick to the Muse before she will
become fecund of poetry as distinguished from guitar-

Rebel: The lines were written by 3L L.
Stevenson for his epitaph, and run:
Under the wide end starry sky,
Dig the grave and let me lie.
Glad did I live and gladly die,
And I laid me down with a will.
This be the verse you grave for me I
Here he lies where he longed to be ;
Home is the sailor, home from sea,
And the hunter home from the 'hill.
B: True: it was said in our haste that A. E. Housmsn
assailed the opponent in his “ Juvenal.” But no : thus it
was in his introduction to “ Manilius." /

A novelty in .22 caliber rifles. As its name indicates, the trig-
ger, located upon the upper side of the grip at the rear of the
bolt, is operated by pressing down with the thumb, thus obvi-
ating “ pull off” in firing. Simplicity and quickness of action
are its features. It is a take-down, and has the widely imi-
tated Winchester bolt action. Notwithstanding its low price,
its quality is the same as that of all Winchester rifles.

SOMETHING LIKE A CURE.
The Case of Mrs. E, LAWES.
(By a Sydney Reporter.)
As the following case achieved un-
usual notoriety it is proper that the
main facts should bo put before the
public in complete form. We aro in-
debted to Mrs. Emily Lawes, of Mo.
21 Liedfern-slreet, Red fern,. for the nar-
rative, which was begun in answer to
this statement by a reporter :
“I have been informed that about
thirteen years ago you caused general
surprise by shaking off a serious ill-
ness. Will you kindly give me the par-
ticulars V”
“With pleasure,” acquiesced Mr 3.
Lawes. “Yes ; it's all thirteen years
since my illness, for it was after my
first child was born that I sank into
such a pitiful state of weakness that
for six wearv weeks I could not put
my foot to the ground. The nurse who
attended me toFd mother she thought
1 was going into a decline, and you
should have seen me then. You would
have thought so, too. Talk about
feebleness ! It was awful. I had a lit-
tle dog that came into my room one
night and jumped on the bod, and
would you believe that 1 didn't have
enough strength to push him off ?”
“At the end of six weeks were you
any better ?”
“If I was it was very slightly, I can
tell you, for 1 was just barely able to
stand, and that was all. The nurse
used to say : ‘For goodness sake don’t
go to the door because you look so
wretched,' and, my word, 1 felt
wretched. When I persisted in trying
to crawl for a few yards about the
house, it was impossible for me to
straighten myself up, and there 1 was
—bent double like an old woman. But
it wasn’t every day that I could get
up, and I remember on one occasion a
relative coming into my bedroom,
and, after looking at me, rushing out.
saying : ‘Come in, Em’s dead !’ so
that will give you an idea of the
deathly appearance I bore. The truth
was, i alterwards learned, that &he
could not notice me breathing, my re-
spiration was so feeble, and that, com-
bined with me fact that I was not ex-
pected to recover, gave her the idea
at once that T was dead. I was very
near it though, and I’m sure I never
thought for a moment that I would
over recover. But there is a Divine
Providence watching over all of us,
and He did not desert me in my hour
of need. 1 had got so fearfully thin
that it must have been painful to look
at me."
“Have you any idea what weight
you were then ?’ J
“I was greatly reduced, and as
ghastly a mortal as you could find in
a day’s march. Well, I was going to
tell you about the blessings that were
afterwards showered upon me. By somo
means or other, when death was un-
doubtedly staring me in the face, I
got into touch with Clements Tonic, a
remedy that 1 had heard a good deal
about, and do you know that the dif-
ference which that medicine made in
me was something extraordinary ? Up
till then T had the greatest difficulty
in the w'orld in making myself eat.
Let the food be as nicely prepared,
and as light as it could possibly be, it
was all the same —one or two mouth-
fuls, and 1 was done. But not so with
the pain, it was then that it started.
My chest felt chocked up with some-
thing, and I was oppressed almost to
suffocation. Hot flushes used to come
and go. the blood rushing to my head,
and making me feel quite giddy, while
the pains in my head nearly distract-
ed me. Now, this is what I liked
about Clements Tonic. It w r as abso-
lutely the only medicine to do me good
in regard to those symptoms.”
“How many others had you given a
trial to ?”
“A great number. I took all sorts
of physics, and not one of them ap-
pealed to my case at all. They were
absolutely worthless. But Clements
Tonic acted like a charm. I could feel
it instilling- fresh vigour into me as
distinctly as one feels the warm glow
of a welcome fire on a winter's night,
and shortly after commencing with it
1 began to feel hungry. This was sure-
ly something surprising. But what
will you think when 1 tell you that
Clements Tonic so acted upon my in-
ternal organs that my food started to
digest again ? Why, there are people
who saw me at the time, who heard
me say how much Clements Tonic had
done, and yet could scarcely believe
their eyes or ears. But it was an in
disputable fact that I was on the
mend, and to my dying day I shall
thank Clements Tonic for it. I used
to sleep very indifferently, and awoke
feeling- none the fresher f >r the rest I had
got—-in tact, I was always so weary
and melancholy, and had such an in-
tense aching feeling right through my
body that 1 often felt that I would
like to lie down and die. I don’t look
as if I am much troubled with such
gruesome thoughts now, though, do I?”
“No ; you certainly look the picture
of health, Mrs. Lawes.’’
“That’s what everybody tells me,
which shows what can happen in even
the most hopeless cases so long as a
few bottles of Clements Tonic can be
got. Goodness me, I am now over
twelve stone weight, and have had six
children since Clements Tonic snatched
me from the grave thirteen years ago,
and I can honestly tell you that from
then till now I have not had one day’s
illness. That will- show you whether
my cure was a complete one or not.
But I don’t think I’ve told you half I
went through yet. J didn’t refer to the
times that 1 had giddy seizures—well,
they were very numerous occasions!
indeed ; and I didn’t say anything
about the horrible feeling of fulness in
the stomach which used to come on
when I had been given some refresh-
ment. This was before using Clements
Tonic, you know. Afterwards, I was
not like the same woman, for I could
eat anything, and not experience the
least inconvenience, every particle of
pain arising from indigestion having
disappeared. There is another thing!
would like to mention in order to
point out what a splendid all-round
remedy Clements Tonic is. It is that
during my illness my heart was great-
lv affected with palpitation, and, un-
der the influence of Clements Tonic
that trouble left me. Again, I was one
of the most nervous of women, and if
I happened to be left in the house
alone I felt so timid that I dared not
move, while to be without a light was
always enough to make me fret terri-
bly. You’ve no idea the excessive mis-
ery my nervousness brought me, and
as I’ve been free from it all these
years it’s time similar sufferers had the
benefit of my experience.’’
“So I’ll print it ?”
“Certainly ; in any way you please
you may publish it.’’

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Tragedy of Time.
Here where wheeling sea birds shrill their ditty,
Flickering flame-like through the sunny calm,
Rose triumphant in its pride a city—
Towers exalted once for prayer and psalm ;
Holy hands built hospitals of pity,
Full of mercy like a sheltering palm.
Church and hospice wrought in faultless fashion.
Hall and chancel bounteous and sublime,
Wide and sweet and glorious with compassion,
Filled and thrilled with force of choral chime.
But fervid prayer allied to music’s passion
Stayed not the descending hand of Time.
Here is the end of all its former glory.
Desolate dust and barren silent stones.
Only there stands one hollow tower and hoary,
Naked and wind-swept, filled with sobbing moans,
Telling the careless sea its sorry story,
Here where the earth is dense with dead men’s
bones.
Now displaced, devoured, and desecrated,
Now by Time’s hands darkly disinterred,
These poor dead that, sleeping here, awaited
Long the Archangel’s re-creating word—
Closed about with roofs and walls high-grated,
Till the blast of judgment should be heard.
Naked, shamed, cast out of consecration,
Gospel and coffin, yea, the very graves
Scoffed at, scattered, shaken from their station,
Spurned and scourged of wind and sea, like staves,
Desolate beyond men’s desolation.
Shrink and sink into the waste of waves.
Scarce a stone whereon a child might stumble
Breaks the grim waste paced alone by me.
Tier by tier, and row by row, they crumble,
They that thought through ages still to be.
Earth and man and all his gods grow' humble,
Here where Time brings pasture to the sea.

The Outcast.
Ah, how I scorn you sitting there,
With your silks and lace and your haughty stare,
And turn from your pomp and your perfumed
pride
To your lord and owner there at your side—
Content with his bargain, I should surmise
From the leering glance and the lustful eyes.
For a bargain it was—you were bought and sold,
Youth and beauty ’gainst age and gold,
With the organ’s note and the bells’ brave peal,
And a brace of bishops to bless the deal.
Once I had youth and grace like you,
A form as rounded, an eye as blue,
A mouth as curved and as dark a tress,
And cheeks as soft to the lips’ caress.
But I gave them all with a love unthrift,
Yours was the bargain, and mine the gift—
And the error, too, as it would appear ;
You sit in your carriage, and I stand heie.
Yet I would not change, by the heaven above,
For your painted pomp, that one draught of love.
For mine was the bliss you can never know
Of the arms a-strain, and the lips a-glow,
When youth and beauty seemed mine to spend,
Not to hoard, and sell at the bitter end.
Love ! —is it love, that loathing fear
That camps o’er you, as the night draws near ?
There’s a dread that must cloud the dance and
feast
In the heart of Beauty who weds the Beast.
If a day were to come wheti hearts are bared
And wrongs redressed, and the balance squared ;
If there were truth in the tales they tell
Of another life, with its heaven and hell,
Say which would be mine, and which your goal ?
I gave my body, you.sold your soul.

HARRY TOWER.
The Philosopher’s Creed.
Oar life’s a conundrum, so hard of solution
We never can solve it, so why should we try ?
Why probe the dark secret of man’s evolution ?
“ Eat, drink and be merry—to-morrow we die.”
Though from dawn of his birth, through the cycle
of ages,
Man has striven behind the drawn curtain to pry,
This phrase can condense all the knowledge of
sages—
“ Eat, drink, and be merry—to morrow we die.”
So why waste the hours in a fruitless endeavor
To penetrate mysteries hid from the eye ?
Whence we come, where we go, is a riddle for
ever—
“ Eat, drink, and be merry—to-morrow we die.”
The sun of our brief day is swiftly declining,
The long, cold, dark night draweth ever more
nigh,
When Death gives his knock ’twill be useless
repining—
“ Eat, drink, and be merry—to-morrow we die.”
Then don’t let us worry with barren surmises,
Nor seek to decipher our wherefore or why ;
But have a good time when occasion arises—
“ Eat, drink, and be merry—to-morrow we die.”
Let us gather from Life all its joy and its laughter,
And sip all the sweets from the days as they fly
Till our innings is closed, then sleep soundly here-
after—
“ Eat, drink, and be merry—to-morrow we die.”

Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the paper
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for 1 ‘ copy. ” Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

LAND POLICIES, HERE AND ELSE-
WHERE.
In a small way—a very small and apologetic way
—a few Australian States are now m iking an
effort to provide land for settlement- near the
coast, where the rainfall is, and where life is en-
durable and agriculture possible. Some of the
States are doing a little more than the average ;
some a little less ; some nothing at all; but the
general result is very poor. Tasmania, probably
the most fertile and promising part of the Com-
monwealth, is doing nothing. With a population
of less than seven persons to the square mile, it
finds not only that it hasn’t room for immigrants,
but that it hasn’t room for its own people.
Latest advices showed its population to be actually
diminishing—crowded out for want of employ-
iSwit and want of land. The area under cul-
tivation is also diminishing. The small farms
are being bought up and consolidated into
large estates by earth-hungry individuals who
allow much of the soil to go out of cul-
tivation when they get it because they have
already more soil than they can manage, and
who drive away population to make room for
sheep and cattle. And Tasmania, though ' it
wants men badly, does nothing to restrict the
aggregation of great estates and to make room for
population; the only thing it really has done of
late years has been to reduce the already scant
taxation on land so as to make the lot of the
mighty land-grabber easier than it was before.
* * * *
Victoria is doing a little more than Tasmania in
the way of providing land for settlement, but
what it is doing seems to be mostly either com-
plete foolishness or complete swindle and corrup-
tion. Bent’s State is divided into 37 counties,
and the last census showed that eight of these had
lost population between 1891 and 1901, while in
a number of other counties population was
practically stationary. The Government is
doing a little for settlement by buy-
ing up poor land at exorbitant prices
from the large landlords, and re-selling it in
small farms, at prices which make the buyer
a slave to a hopeless mortgage all his life. Some-
times the prices are so absurd that the State
doesn’t sell the land at all, and has its ridiculous
transaction left on its hands. There is no com-
pulsory purchase. The landowner not only gets
pretty well what he asks, but he often gets more
than he would ask from a private buyer, and he
also gets something like twice as much as the
valuation which the State cheerfully accepted
when it was collecting probate duty on the
property. Also, he has been known to ask a
dozen times as much as the value he pays tax on.
And even if he only got the current market price,
that price has been ridiculously inflated by the
exemption of the land from its fair share of
taxation, and by the making of roads, rail-
ways and waterworks out of loans, the
interest on which the land • isn’t expected
to pay. Also, while the Bent Government
breaks up an estate here and there at absurd
cost, it does nothing to prevent new big estates
forming twice as fast as the old ones disappear.
So Victoria, with less than 14 people to the square
mile, is overcrowded ; its population is growing
very slowly; and instead of having room for
immigrants, it is exporting its own young man-
hood and womanhood at the rate of about 14,000
per annum.
* * * *
New South Wales is doing a little —a very little
—in the way of resuming large estates, and is
doing it mostly on the same swindle principles as
Victoria. Its swindle is even a trifle worse, for
while Victoria has done some of its disastrous
resumptions out of revenue, N.S. W. hasdone every-
thing out of loans. N.S.W., like Victoria, buys
on the voluntary principle, and often at ridiculous
prices, which make settlement on the acquired land
a matter of difficulty. Like Victoria it does
nothing to prevent the accumulation of large
estates faster than they are cut up. It is also
overcrowded—with less than jive persons to the
square mile—and last census showed that in
no less than 47 counties (out of a total of 141)
population was decreasing, the decrease, in a few
instances, being in the most fertile regions of the
State. As regards the other States, Queensland
is trying to do a little towards breaking up the
great estates by taxation. S. Australia is doing a
little more. Westralia is doing nothing ; and the
Northern Territory, as usual, is quite forgotten.
Taking Australia in the aggregate, its politicians
are still slaves to the English doctrine that the
great land-grabber is sacred, and that any inter-
ference with his right to depopulate the country
is confiscation or worse—something almost as
bad as Sodom and a trifle more nefarious than
Gomorrah.
• • • *
Let this feeble, worse than half-hearted policy
be put in contrast with that of a few countries
which have really dealt with the land settlement
problem with something akin to sincerity. The
following scattered examples are taken from
Mulhall’s little volume, the “Industries and
Wealth of Nations ” :
Denmark : The reform of land tenure has been attended
with the most astonishing transformation. In the 18th
century Denmark consisted of 614 estates, belonging to the
same number of noblemen, ranging from 10,000 acres up-
wards. On each estate there were 200 or 300 tenants, called
bondsmen, whom an English traveller described as “ dirty,
devoid of energy, and not so well-fed as Jamaica niggers.”
...In 1808 a reform was introduced by Frederic VI.,
which compelled the nobles to sell farms to their tenants at
£6 an acre, and an official return in 1840 showed that in
30 years the peasantry had bought up half the kingdom.
Those who had not bought farms were termed huusmen,
or tenan ts whom the law protected by enactment that the
landlord could neither raise the rent, nor evict them so
long as they paid it. In 1861, Bishop Monrad’s law
gave still farther facilities to the peasantry for the pur-
chase of land.
For fully half-a-century Denmark has flatly pro-
hibited by law the enlargement of estates, and for
97 years it has had in operation an automatic
process for the breaking up of great estates—a
process that involves neither loans nor resumption
swindles, and which goes on all the time, even
when Denmark is sleeping, and the ghost of
Hamlet’s father walks at Elsinore. And Den-
mark has become, under this system, the richest
agricultural and dairying country on earth, and
its bleak sandy soil isn’t overcrowded, even with
a population of 160 people to the square mile.
» * * *
Prussia : In one generation nearly 30,000,000 acres of
pasture and waste lands have been brought into cultiva-
tion, the immediate consequence of breaking up the large
estates, which beneficial measure has been attended with
an increase of Sh per cent, in the value of agricultural
products. The nobles were allowed to retain one-half
their estates, while the other moiety was distributed
among the tenants, and in compensation for what was
taken from them the nobles received Prussian Consols
equivalent to 18 years rent, the coupons of such consols
being met by a land-tax of 5 per cent, imposed on the
tenants for a term of 47 years. The Stein law, as it was
called, has completely changed the internal condition ;
50 years ago Prussia was in possession of 30,000 nobles,
whereas the present number of landowners exceeds
1,500,000.
Austria : The revolution of 1848 brought about a
change. One-half of the estates of each nobleman were
broken up into farm-lots for the peasants, without other
obligation than an annual charge of 2£ per cent, on the
amount paid by the Crown in compensation to the nobles.
This gave such an impulse to rural pursuits that in less
than 20 years land doubled in price, and the peasants
became industrious and thrifty.
Scandinavia : When Bernadotte came to the throne in
1818 he found that 30 noblemen owned Norway, and 1200
gentlemen owned Sweden The grain crops seldom
reached 50,000 tons, or one bushel per inhabitant, for
which reason the bread of the rural population was made
of Sawdust and rye. ... More than 10,000,000 acres were
sold to the peasants at prices averaging Is. sd. per acre,
and when Lang visited Sweden and Norway in 1830, he
was surprised to find that “the condition'of the rural
classes was better than in Scotland.” In 1840 the
psas mts had acquired 16,000,000 acres and the area under
tillage was 5,200,000 acres, having quadrupled in 20
ye.rs. . . In little more than half a century the farmers
(ivho previously lived on sawdust and fish) have been
enabled, by the breaking up of the. nobles’ estates, to aid
£.208,000,001 to the national wealth.
» * * *
These are a few records of the countries that
did things in the way of agricultural settlement,
and in every case they began by breaking up the
great estates. Other cases, which there isn’t
space to particularise, are those of France. Hol-
land, Belgium and Switzerland. And on the
other side of the case Mulhall puts two shocking
examples :
Great Britain : The concentration of landed pro-
perty in the hands of a few is a special characteristic of
the United Kingdom. . . . Two-thirds of England, nine-
tenths of Ireland, nineteen-twentieths of Scotland are
held in ownership by a small group of persons. . . . Land-
owners and farmers have lost £450,000,000 of capital since
18S0 that is, an average of £30,000,000 yearly. . . .
Nearly 80 per cent, of the total wealth is held by 1£ per
cent, of the adult population. . . . The suffering of the
indigent classes in our large towns is greater than ever
before ; the condition of this class has been aptly de-
scribed as far worse than that of the Hottentots.
Portugal : Agriculture is the chief occupation of the
people, and yet is so backward that hardly one-fifth of
Portugal is under cultivation . . . 5,000,000 acres culti-
vated ; 10,000,000 acres idle but suitable for tillage ;
5,000,000 of mountain waste. There is no prospect of the
available land being cultivated so long as the present
system of land tenure exists ... 60 per cent, of the
whole area is in the hands of noblemen. ... If it were
possible for the Government to do as was done in
Austria and Prussia, namely, to purchase from the nobles
one-half of their estates, say 6,300,000 acres, and distri-
bute the same in thirty-acre lots among the peasantry,
the cultivated area would be doubled in a few years.
• • * »
These are a few cases out of many which show
the contrast between the countries that have done
things in the way of agricultural settlement and
the countries that have left things undone. No
country has ever solved the problem which faces
Australia, and exhibited a tender reverence for
the alleged rights and the finer feelings of the
great landlord at the same time. France
settled the difficulty of its great landlords by undis-
guised confiscation—with execution added when
the law could get hold of the landlord. Denmark,
Scandinavia, Prussia and Austria, but especially
Denmark, mostly did the same work by a process
which Australian Tories would denounce as blank
and outrageous confiscation. All these countries
built up a great and profitable agriculture. Great
Britain let the problem slide for fear that it
might inconvenience its great landlords, and its
agriculture is in process of extinction ; it has at
least its manufactures and commerce to fall back
upon, but one result of its policy is a huge
aggregation of wealth in the hands of a very few,
and at the other end of the social scale a vast mass
of about the blackest misery which the world can
show. Portugal was also tender of the feelings of
its great landlords, and having little manufac-
tures or commerce to fall back upon, it has become
the deadest back number in Europe.
* * * *
Australian Toryism, which is a wonderfully old
and crusted and pig-headed Toryism for so
young a community, is mostly Freetrade. It
mostly says that we should not create manufac-
tures, but should be satisfied to “ go on the land ”
and drag out raw products. It also says that we
should stick to the great landlord system which
prevents there being any land to go on except at
almost impossible rents. It says we should
acquire population, and in almost every part of
the country where the big landlord is supreme he
is driving out population. It is especially fond
of quoting Denmark as the brightest instance on
earth of a country which has grown rich by agri-
culture, and the brightest evidence that wealth
can be achieved by “going on the land,” but it
denounces as robbery any attempt to follow the
methods by which Denmark laid the foundations
of its agricultural wealth, and the wholesale com-
pulsory land purchase system of King Frederick
VI. would be classed in Australia as red and
horrible revolution. The old Toryism of this
country bids Australia to become agricul-
turally rich like Denmark by following the
methods which have ruined agriculture in
England, and beggared it in Portugal. And when
Australia, as in the case of the Queensland Land
Monopoly Tax, proposes making even a micro-
scopic effort to break up the big estates which block
settlement in the cultivable part of the country,
and thus attempts to follow the Danish example,
violent English papers like the Statist use lan-
guage which wouldn’t be respectable if .vddressed
to a dog. The Statist is angry because this
country makes the smallest attempt to provide
land for an agricultural population, and is abusive
at the same time because this country doesn’t get
an agricultural population. It tells us to follow
the methods whereby England is fast losing its
agricultural population. And in doing all this it
is backed up by the Tory landowning class of
Australia, which is driving what agricultural
population we have out of Tasmania, out of all
Western Victoria, and out of 47 counties of
N.S.W.
* * ■* *
Australia, in its efforts to please everybody, is
pleasing nobody, not even itself. It is doing
very little to recover land for close settlement —so
little that it can’t yet provide soil on possible
terms for its own people, to say nothing of sup-
plying immigrants. It is scorned in England for
not finding abundant land for immigrants, and de-
nounced as a thief and a confiscator for the little
it is doing in that direction. The best thing to
do in such circumstances is to impose a sweeping
graduated land-tax in order to break up the pre-
sent big estates and make the aggregation of new
ones impossible ; to prohibit any man who holds
more than a certain limited area in the good part
of the country adding a single acre to his estates ;
to give all agricultural tenants the right of com-
pulsory purchase from their landlords at a strictly
reasonable figure after the Danish system ; and
then, having thus provided abundance of land,
Australia should let it be known that desirable
white agricultural immigrants are wanted in
multitudes from Britain, Canada, California and
elsewhere. The yell of execration which such a
land policy would raise in England might be dread-
ful, but when England had blown off that one
fearsome curse it would probably have exhausted
itself and worn out its dictionary. There is only
a certain number of curses in the language, and
when they are all used at once the business is
over. As for the great Australian landlord, there
would presently be none of him left to denounce
his native land —the land that has endured him so
long. And after the first burst of execration this
live policy of land settlement would begin to
vindicate itself by its success, whereas the present
pottering little methods do nothing and vindicate
nothing.

I have been accused by some New South Wales re-
viewers of my novel, “ The Snare of Strength,” of draw-
ing, not portraits, but caricatures of Australian Parlia-
mentar'ans ; and I think that any impartial study of the
stonewallers of the Federal House of Representatives will
be a sufii dent answer. Peculiarly enough, the objecting
reviewers are of New South Wales, where studies of
p ilitieal larrikins and Tartuffes may be had in the Par-
liament of Macquarie-street any day. In the early history
of the elder State the scoundrels of the Rum Corps
became the Pure Merinoes, who handed diwn their
villainy to the Cabbage Tree Mob, who died intestate, and
whose qualities thereby accrued to the New South Wales
Parliament. The burlesque secessionist, Mr. John Haynes,
is no more ridiculous—and he is infinitely less irritating
—than the cheap Mr. Carrutiiers, who attempts to
secure his preposterous and self-assumed dignity by
obstructing the Commonwealth’s establishment of the
Federal capital on the selected site. The people of New
South Wales, but for the gang of opportunists who call
themselves “ leaders,” are as good Australians as any ;
but of the present Opposition in the Federal House there
is not one man who is not a parochialist of the worst kind
—for the parochialism is streaked with sectarianism, to
which deplorable farce many of them owe their political
existence, and which is to-day Australia’s greatest curse.
Of the Victorians and the men of the other States
who have foolishly joined them there is not one
man who is not a bitterly unprogressive Tory, and
there are not two who do not prove their love
for the foreigner and their low appraisement of the Aus-
tralian by opposing any Protection of the Australian
against the sweated labor of the world. The Labor mem-
ber who thinks, or even talks, Foreign trade, is a self-
stultification ; the Tory, who is always a Freetrader, is an
aggressively frank traitor to our country.

Samples of the political portraits which I am accused
of exaggerating into caricatures are sitting on the left
hand of the Speaker of the House of Representatives—or,
at least, they were sitting there the other afternoon.
Two of them—the Hon. Joseph Cook, member for
Parramatta, and the Hon. Alfred Conroy, member
for Werriwa—were twice named by the Speaker. Mr.
Cook is soured by the knowledge that his leader,
the indefinite Mr. Reid, has gone for ever from place
and power. Rut for the Labor movement, Mr. Cook
would probably have remained a trucker all his days ;
as it is, his little soul hates the Labor movement
which brought him into the sunlight, and at every
chance he bites the hand that fed him. Mr. Conroy is
a typical “hard case” of the bush, good-humored,
sneering, boisterous, and reckless ; Mr. Wilks, a
talker of infinite nothings—a thin version of Mr.
a drawn-out Quilf ; a wry man whose work-shirking liver
makes him see a Vatican in every bush ; a man who looks
under the bed every night in the hope of finding a Jesuit.
Yet even when he is alone there is a Jesuit in the room.
In England, where a man can indirectly buy a seat in the
House of Commons by a donation to party funds, the
election of Mr. Kelly, intellectually a good shop walker
whose chances have been spoiled by politics, would not
surprise so much as it does here. A futile person this — of
neither solidity nor brilliance, and elected solely by the
grace of the tin lodes of Herberton. As perky as he is
dull, Mr. Kelly was educated at Cambridge ; the graft of
the political larrikinism of New South Wales State Par-
liament on the Cambridge manner would cause a revo-
lution in that ancient seat of learning did the ancient
seat of learning know. The rancorous Mr. Lonsdale
is of the Gaunson type, The Hon. Bruce Smith,
whose chief title to fame is that he is the Friend of
the Jap and the enemy of Australian nationalism, has
lent but his “ moral support” to the stonewall, which has
been the grave of Mr. Dugald Thomson’s one time repu-
tation for fairness.

Mr. Sydney Smith, who is known in his own dignified
State as “ Pumpkin ” Smith, almost defies placing. Deep-
eyed as a starved hawk, an inconsequential talker, a
futility in everything, he has the saving grace of strong
attachment to the always uncertain Mr. Reid. When the
Yes-No man looks at him his eyes retire further and he
grins like a skull. On Saturday, when Mr. Reid arrived
from Sydney to save the bleeding country after
taking the bleeding country’s money for a week
without service while he devoted himself to
the professional business of a divorce case, Mr.
Smith —who is, theatrically speaking-, Mr. Reid’s dresser —
rushed to Mr. Cameron, who was drivelling against time,
to ask him to hold the floor a little longer ; and having
failed therein because Mr. Cameron had drivelled himself
to a standstill, fawned on his elusive “ leader ” as that
combined low comedian and premiere danseuse entered
to his cue. And when Mr. Reid began to lash himself
into the patriotic fever which is usual with him when in
Opposition, the adoring Mr. Smith sat in his shadow and
bleated “’Ear ! ’Ear ! ’Earl ’Ear !” continuously, until
the House sounded like Flemington on the days of the
sheep sales. Buttoner, dresser, fugleman—Mr. Smith
plays many parts in the service of that unconsciously
great actor who is out of power in Australia for ever.
But Mr. Reid still looks on the Labor party as his pro-
spective master. Almost all of his speech was delivered
to Mr. Watson.
* * * *
The other of the New South Wales members of the
Opposition call for little wonder but as to how they got
there. The cheap, conceited Mr. Liddell sits uncomfort-
ably in the seat of Mr. Barton. Mr. Fuller is a loud
futility, and Mr. Lee is an excellent teetotaller and
nothing more. But what can be said in mitigation of the
Victorian members who follow Mr. Reid? Nobody would
expect anything better of the Anglomaniac, Mr. Cameron,
of Tasmania. Mr. Cameron was educated at Oxford, and
judging by results, he was educated not at the University
but at the home farm there. And the out-of-office sore-
ness of Philip Fysii explains his position in the Opposition
corner. The wooden Mr. Gibb is at home there. He has
not even coughed an interjection during his Parlia-
mentary life —he interposes his sixteen stone weight of
stupidity against any measure for the betterment of the
conditions of Australian flesh and blood —except it be
quadrupedal. The Opposition whip found he was even
too stupid, or not stupid enough, to stonewall, and he
has not spoken on this or any other subject. He simply
stares and breathes. He gets £4OO a year for this.
* * * •
It is to the Victorian Protectionists who sit in Opposi-
tion and who have obstructed business with the despair-
ing Reidites that I look for vindication of my innocence
of caricature. Mr. Knox, elected as a Protectionist, joins
the Foreign-trade Party, and supports the stonewall,
saving, “The gloves are off”—an unfortunate remark,
considering his tonnage. We can forgive the unim-
portant Mr. Robinson ; can we forgive the Protectionist
Mr. M‘Lean— the one-time half-Premier ? Can we again
forgive Mr. M’Cay— who in the Victorian State Parlia-
ment ratted from his old party for the sake of office, and
lost his seat as punishment; who was elected to the
Federal Parliament as a Protectionist, and again ratted
for the sake of office, and who will again be cast out of
politics as punishment? There has been a belief in the
single-heartedness of politicians too long ; and so strong
has it been that it has amounted to a superstition. The
mean, envious, and insolent obstruction of public busi-
ness by the office-hungry Opposition has scotched that
superstition, if it hasn’t killed it. My “ political cari-
catures ” were not caricatures, but portraits—they are at
the top of Bourke-street for any man to see.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
About “Freedom of Speech” and Similar
Trash.
The wise decision of Prime Minister Deakin to at
last get some work done in the Australian Parlia-
ment led to an incredible amount of dry drivel on
the part of the obstructionist party about what it
was pleased to call “freedom of speech.” The
term is practically an obsolete one so far as this
country is concerned, and a survival of the Dark
Ages, but many terms and formalities survive
long after their usefulness has departed, and the
battered old relic is still something to conjure
with. In the days when the power rested with
the sovereign, or with a Parliament that only
represented a fraction of the nation, freedom of
speech was a thing to be held sacred. The people
didn’t govern, nor did they expect to govern ;
the chief thing they asked for was the
right to speak even if speeih did no good—to
bark at the oppressor as the dog does, or
to bray at him as the ass does. For
centuries the people demanded freedom of
speech, and at last they got it. They attained
to it after long struggles, just as they gradually
arrived at the stage-coach after long and weary
processes of development; but now, the old
original sense, it is obsolete just as the stage-
coach is becoming obsolete. What is wanted now
is freedom to do some work. In Federal politics
the people are the Parliament. They have no
one to protest against except themselves. They
don’t want freedom of speech to complain of any
tyranny save their own, and that doesn’t require
much speech—the effective complaint is made at


the ballot-box. Freedom of speech used to mean
the right of the man who had something to say to
say it. Now, in the vocabulary of Reid and
Cook and Johnson, it means the right of the man
who has nothing left to say to keep on saying
it, wherefore Pumpkin Smith “arranges for
speakers to talk for two hours each whether they
have anything to talk about or not. _ But
Parliament is not elected to talk, but to legislate.
The people are supposed to elect members on
account of the measures they promise to
pass—not on the amount of conversation they
promise to put in. The party which prevents
measures being passed by its eternal gabble is a
tyrant and an oppressor, and thwarts the popular
will just as much as the old kings, who muzzled
the press and prohibited public meetings. A
Czar who won’t let the people legislate for them-
selves by refusing them a Parliament is no more
an enemy to freedom than a Joe Cook oligarchy,
which won’t let them legislate for themselves by
reason of its gabble and obstruction. Freedom of
speech is a term that covers many things, but it
doesn’t cover the right of a dog to howl all night
and keep the public awake; it doesn’t cover the
right of a loony obstructionist to hold up the rail-
way traffic or the tramway traffic for six hours
or so while he speaks his mind freely in
the middle of the line ; it doesn’t cover
the right of the congregation to give back-
talk to the preacher and turn the service
into a pandemonium, or the right of the whole
crowd to talk at once at a political meeting or a
theatre ; and it no more covers the claim of a gang
of clattering and malevolent lunatics to suspend
public business than it covers the right of the
clerks in the A.M.P. office to suspend insurance
business while they deliver orations to each other
from their desks. When the people’s representa-
tives have no wrongs left to protest against except
those for which they are themselves responsible
they don’t want to talk, but to work. No doubt
obstruction has prevented the passing of bad
measures as well as good ones, but it had no right
to do either. When the people elect fool legisla-
tors they deserve to get fool legislation, and to get
it promptly, and if they always got it promptly
they would get a better sense of their responsi-
bilities, and cease to elect fool legislators. At
present there is an idea that any ass is good
enough for Parliament because, owing to obstruc-
tion, nothing will be done, and when nothing is
being done an ass is as good as anybody else. That
idea can’t be got rid of too soon.

Wanted : New Markets.
Talking to Sydney commercial men last week,
Ex-Governor Jersey “pointed out the imp rtance
of opening up new markets.” It is safe to bet
that straightway the average Sydney commer-
cial man, of the sort that goes to Governor’s
lunches, thought about the possibilities of doing a
line with the people of Senegambia, or Saghalien,
or Tirnbuctoo, or some other remote part, whose
language he doesn’t know, whose requirements he
isn’t sure of, and whom he could only supply at
vast expense, and by dragging his goods half over
the world, even if he did know the sort of goods
they wanted. Yet right at the Australian com-
mercial man’s own door there is a market for
£37,020,842 worth of goods, taking last year’s
Commonwealth figures ; and if he set himself to
supply that market, there would be such an in-
crease of manufacturing population, and so many
more thiugs would be required, that the figures
would probably be increased by at least 50 per cent,
almost at once. He knows the people who use
these goods, he speaks their language, he knows
what things they need, and to a great extent he
has already the agencies by which he could dis-
tribute the goods. And to get the trade—a trade
which is already made, but at present is in some-
one else's hands—he wouldn’t have to send out
special commissioners at vas; expense, and spend
huge sums in opening up and extending the busi-
:ness, and risk adverse judgments every time he
had a disagreement with his new customers and
had to take them to their own courts; and he
would save freights, and marine insurance, and
•about eight middlemen’s charges. All that he has
to do is to decide that the market is here,
and that he is going to have it; and then,
if he leaves off his Foreign-trade folly, and
votes for people who will establish a high
Protective tariff instead of for G. Reid, and Con-
eoy, and Willie-motor Kelly, and Wilks, and
Pulsford, and Bruce Smith, he can have the
market straight off. The whole question is
whether it is better to have Bill Wilks and an
uncertain market in Tirnbuctoo or some decent
Protectionist and an absolutely certain market in
Australia. Compared with Australia there is no
market in all the world so large on a population
basis; in fact, deducting the specie and bullion,
the whole world in 1904 only took £39,700,000
worth of Australian goods; yet here is a new
market, absolutely under Australian control if it
only likes to say the word, for £37,020,842 worth
of goods. To overlook this market, and strain to
capture the trade of Senegambia, is just as mad a
piece of business as it would be if the Pitt-street
shop didn’t dress its windows to catch the trade
of the people who use Pitt-street, but instead
placarded it with bills to the effect that Sydney
trade wasn’t wanted—what that shop desired was
the custom of Boggabri and the trade of Yam
Creek.

An American Stinking Fish.
The following, from Collier’s Weekly, is about
the United States—the country which Bruce
Smith describes to audiences of silly fashionable
women as having no immigration restrictions
whatever, and therefore presenting such a wonder-
ful and beautiful contrast to benighted Australia,
where his own Stinking Fish party is
ALIEN LAW BARBARITIES.
The callous stupidity on the part of immigration officers
which has led to the Chinese boycott is not displayed
exclusively at the expense of Mongolians. When the
steamer Hamburg reached New York, on August 28, the
hawk-eyed inspectors discovered on board of her a man
who had lived in the United States for thirty-two years,
who had with him $.1,168.20 in cash, and who said that he
had voted for Garfield twenty-five years ago. He had
gone to Germany recently on a visit, and upon his return
was sentenced to be summarily deported because he could
not show his second naturalisation papers and had passed
the Osler limit by three years. On the same ship was a
butcher fifty-five years old, who asserted that he had
been in business in New York for ten years. He came
back last May, and was deported on account of a growth on
his neck. That, he declared, was cured after his enforced
return to Germany, but when he returned the officials
were ready for him again. This time they decided to
deport him on the ground that the United States had no
use for a man fifty-five years old. On the 29th a woman
was deported with a baby, an American citizen, born that
very day. She had a home in New York, where she had
lived for fourteen months with her husband, who was
earning a comfortable livelihood. Ller mind had been
temporarily affected by the strain of approaching child-
birth, and she had been sent to Bellevue, whence she had
been transferred to Ward’s Island and registered as a
public charge, in spite of her husband’s protest and his
offer to give a bond for her support in a private asylum.
She recovered her reason as soon as her baby was born,
but her home was broken up and she was shipped abroad
in a condition that threatened her life along with the boy
whose birth made him eligible to the Presidency of the
United States. It is atrocities like this, which have no
relation with the original purpose of the immigration
laws, which give foreigners the impression that the
United States is inhr bited by savages.
Nothing Australia ever did to any white or
colored immigrant comes within 1000 miles of
these United Stated proceedings. And the com-
ments passed upon them suggest that the U.S.
is raising a Fish of its own which smells almost
exactly like Bruce Smith’s, and that gentleman,
who seems to think he is the only Fish around,
should hold out the depreciated tail of friendship
to this American brother. But especially, as a
gentleman, and a member of the legal trades
union, ho should give up deceiving people with
silly yarns about how Uncle Sam takes all the
world to his capacious bosom and asks no ques-
tion. Uncle Sam gets immigrants by hundreds
of thousands because his strenuous High Tariff
policy enables him to offer almost unlimited
employment, but there is nothing gushing
about him, and on the slightest excuse of
undesirability he says plainly and dis-
tinctly that there is no capacious bosom on his
premises. A country which ejects as an unde-
sirable immigrant an infant who was born on its
own soil, and who had never been in any other
country in its short life, is one that only an
outrageously ignorant or a very unscrupulous
barrister could hold up to admiration on the
ground that it freely admitted everybody. The
Bulletin doesn’t say that the U.S. is wrong in
this matter; what it does say is that the Bruce
Smith party is an insufferable nuisance, a silly
fraud, and a good deal of Sapphira’s husband.

A Letter from Maoriland.
“Melbournian-in-Exile” writes from Dunedin :
I am lucklessly condemned to sojourn for a time in
Southern Maoriland —a stranger within the gates of
Scotchbyterian Dunedin—gloomy city of grim self-
righteousness.
One of the hospitable pleasantries of the graceless in-
habit!. >ts of the place takes the form of reminding the
Australian that his land was partly populated by con-
victs, and hinting that the taint remains, to the present
detriment of the people of the Commonwealth.
The best answer “Melbournian-in-Exile” can
make to any ill-mannered and possibly red-headed
Presbyterian of Dunedin is that Australians are,
to some extent, the descendants of convicts, just
like Englishmen, and Americans, and Maori-
landers. For a while Britain sent a small pro-
portion of its criminals to the West Indies and to
what is now the United States, and kept the rest
at home to be the fathers and mothers of the
rising generation. Then for a while it sent a small
proportion of its convicts to Australia, and kept the
great majority at home to be the fathers and mothers
of the rising generation. The rest of the time
Britain kept all its convicts at home to be the
fathers and mothers of the rising generation, and
under its “open-door” system it now imports
foreign convicts very largely as well. In the old
days it was very easy to be a convict in England,
and rather difficult to avoid being one. Then, when
England had accumulated so much history that
almost everybody had forefathers and foremothers
who had been imprisoned, or pilloried, or pub-
licly whipped, or all three, it sent out the descen-
dants of its lags to colonise Maoriland. The chief
point of difference is that the ancestors of the first
Maorilanders served their sentences in England
or elsewhere, while a few of Australia’s ancestors
came out before their sentences had expired.
When their sentences had expired they often
went over to Maoriland, which was largely
settled, in the golden days, from Australia.
Between Maoriland’s imported convict fore-
fathers and the people whom it has convicted
since their arrival in the State, it can rest content
(like most other countries) in the cheerful assur-
ance that every one of its citizens has probably
got the gaol and the hangman in his family some-
where. As a matter of history, the Southern
States of America were more extensively settled
by convicts than Australia ever was, but
the person of British descent, who thinks there is
some kind of joke in the “ Botany Bay ” gag,
seldom mentions that fact to the traveller from
Virginia or>the Carolinas. If he did he would
stand a fair chance to have the remark and his
teeth crowded down his throat together, for there
is something about the man from Carolina
which doesn’t invite confidences about his “con-
vict ancestry, ” and he hates to be interrupted at
his cocktail with remarks about the free passages
of his forefathers.
A Conspiracy that Failed.
Sydney wharf laborers nearly fell into the trap
laid for them, but not quite. With the object of
showing how Arbitration had failed again,
numerous papers and people did all they knew to
lead the men to strike, virtually against an award
of the Arbitration Court. It was a cunningly-
worked conspiracy. Day by day the men read
the most definite statements that a majority of
them had decided not to go to work ; their objec-
tions to the award were dwelt upon ; and objec-
tions that they had never thought of were put
into their heads. If the mischief-makers had
been really anxious to prevent the strike that they
professed to regard as such a serious matter,
their course was clear enough. They would
have argued the men out of any objections
they had, and pointed out the far-reaching
consequences of anything in the nature of
a refusal to accept the Court’s award. But they
wanted a strike, just as the same sort of hypo-
crites, during other strikes, and while shrieking
for “law and order,” have deliberately fomented
lawlessness and disorder so as to turn public sym-
pathy against the men. Those tactics have suc-
ceeded in other cases, and they nearly succeeded
in this one. For a few hours the wharf laborers,
gulled into believing that the members had de-
cided individually not to offer themselves for
work, held back. Then they reflected that their
union had sanctioned nothing of the sort, so they
resumed work, and on Tuesday—the day after all
the trouble was to occur, according to the cun-
ning newspaper reports of a week previously—
“wharf laborers did nothing to hamper the
steamship owners ” (Sydney Telegraph re-
port). The conspiracy to foment a strike,
and supply the reactionaries with another
stick to beat Arbitration with, had duffered out.
But, not to be quite cheated out of the victory
for which they had plotted, the enemies of Arbi-
tration say —“Well, anyhow, the incident shows
arbitration doesn’t prevent strikes.” It shows
nothing of the sort. Granted that some individual
men have less respect for an award of the court
than they should have (though, on the word of
Maoriland Arbitration Judges, employers far
more frequently seek to evade awards than em-
ployees), the fact still remains that the registered
union must obey the award. Strikes are illegal,
and a union dare not issue strike-pay. Its whole
funds must be maintained within the State and
within the power of the State law, and this
is the guarantee that no strike pay will
be issued. The disaffected individual may
“strike”, but he can get no strike pay; and
a real strike without strike pay is simply impossi-
ble. Even a majority of the men may abstain
from work for a few days; but there can be no
organised stoppage. Arbitration does prevent
strikes, then. It even prevents them in the teeth
of widespread conspiracies to keep it from doing
its natural work.
The Tory Intelligence.
A CRY from the recent Sydney Conference of the
“ Australian Women’s Liberal Union,” which
moaned very heavily over the union label, evi-
dently under the impression that it is a new horror,
instead of being an American device of long
standing, which hasn’t broken anything or raised
the price of anything :
Working men’s wives would suffer if the provision be-
came law. She might want a table for £l, but the union
labelled article might be £1 55., while a man might be
ready to make it for £l, and find it pay him at that price;
still the label prevented him making it.
If the rather ungrammatical persons who run the
: ‘ Women’s Liberal Union ” really believed this
truly awe-inspiring rot, they wouldn’t oppose the
union label. Rather they would reckon that it
was a good thing to have it, and to let the work-
ing man and his wife learn, by bitter experience,
the evils of unionism. But, as a matter of fact,
their state of mental confusion seems to be such
that they have no distinct beliefs, except that
something dreadful and shapeless may happen
any day unless they put on their best hats and
prevent it at great length. The proposal as re-
gards the union label is simply that, when the
table above-mentioned is made, a mark may
be put on it, setting forth that it was
made by union labor. It would be made
by the same workman at the same cost
if the mark wasn’t put on it. The mark won’t
cost 55., nor a tenth part of a penny. And the
non-union table will still be on the market; the
only change of circumstances will be that the per-
son who wants union-made goods will be able,
under the new conditions, to make sure that he
gets them, instead of having to take the unreliable
assurance of the commercial male relative of the
Women’s Liberal League female. The person
who doesn’t want union goods will also be able to
make reasonably sure that he gets them. It is
freedom that is aimed at—freedom to buy what
you darned well please and be sure that you get
it. Taking it all round there is a strangely infan-
tile mental confusion and obfuscation about the
“ Women’s Liberal Union.” In all its debates it
didn’t touch one subject without mixing up its
facts and details till its statements got far
below the average coherence of a Domain orator,
and sounded worse than the hysterical statements
of Ann, the factory girl, telling her mate Jane
(also hysterical) about the row she had with
the forewoman. In the early days of the Fran-
chise Reform movement in England it is said that
there were illiterate individuals who believed that
“ the franchise ” meant an equal distribution of
property, and who drew lots at the village pub.
for bits of the squire’s land ; but even their lack of
mental development was a comparatively trivial
jest compared to that of the society lady who puts
on her best hat and goes to a large hall to clamot
with others of her kind and straighten up the
universe. And in this respect the society male is
much on a par with the female. This writer has
heard it related in all seriousness, at a dinner
garty of affluent evening-dress men and women in
vdney, how a Tory citizen had a pet sheep
which grazed on his lawn, how a friend sheared it
for him by way of recreation, and how the friend
was fined £lO at the police-court for doing
it because he wasn’t a professional shearer
and a member of the union. Such a thing
might happen if the sheep were a client, and the
shearer a person who did legal work without
being a member of the lawyers’ trade union, but it
couldn’t happen otherwise. Yet all the company
heaved a great sigh and said “ How dreadful! ”
and about half-a-dozen affluent fools “ remembered
the terrible incident quite well.” There is no
remedy in such a case. The only thing is to buy
the patient a rattle and a blue monkey on a stick,
and bid him, or her, run away and play.

Land Settlement, Real and Bogus,
When the Victorian Closer Settlement Act was
passed, the House of Rich Landlords, with the Tory
powers in the Assembly, fought against the inser-
tion of a provision for compulsory purchase. An
alleged compulsory clause was at last inserted, but
of such a nature that it isn’t compulsory—to put it
into operation requires the passing of another Act
of Parliament. The Land Purchase Board was
given £500,000 to play with, and with this money
15 estates have been bought. When the Bill was
being debated, the Rich Landlords insisted that
estates would be voluntarily sold at reasonable
prices, and they point now to the operations
of the Land Purchase Board as a triumphant
vindication of their assertion. But the
facts are otherwise. Of the 15 estates not
one is of the class that ought to be used for
closer settlement. What is wanted is fertile
arable land where there is easy communication
with markets. The 15 State purchases—bought
at from £3 to £8 per acre—are second, third, or
fourth-rate soil. In spite of the crying need for
farm-holdings in Victoria, these lands are so little
desirable that they have failed to draw applica-
tions for more than a portion of the area.
Meantime, the prominence given to “Closer
Settlement” in the newspapers has caused a
mild boom in rural land. Enterprising land-
lords are making subdivisions, which are adver-
tised as “divisions for settlement,” and they are
realising fine prices. But go through these
subdivided estates, and you won’t find the
settlers. The allotments have mostly been secured
by speculative buyers, and the would-be farmer is
as far from getting fairly cheap land as ever. The
alleged voluntary subdvision is a sham. The
voluntary sales to the Government are sales of
poor land only. The landlord who has a tenantry
is enjoying the benefits of the mild boom, and his
rents are frightful. Travel in parts of the
Western district —ideal land for settlers —and you
will find tenants who suffer under such rentals that
they cannot make their holdings pay without gross
overstocking. Thus the soil is quickly becoming
exhausted, and the end of these tenants is ruin.
Dairy farmers solve the problem of rent by elimi-
nating wages, and enslaving their children as
laborers from the time they are nine or ten years
old, and the cry of these miserable, over-worked,
joyless children goes up in judgment against the
brutish Rich Landlords of Victoria, just as
did the cry of the children immured in the
English coal mines against their slave-drivers
years ago. Many landlords insist on receiv-
ing rents clear of all deduction, and the
tenant pays the landlord’s income-tax as well
as his own. There is a Bill now before Vic. Parlia-
ment to provide settlers with improved holdings—
the settler to receive land, material for improve-
ments, and a living wage while the improvements
are being made, the whole to be paid back by
instalments. This measure may or may not pass
the House of Landlords, but in any case it offers
no help to the acquisition of land. Real com-
pulsory purchase (as in Maoriland) and a heavy
graduated land-tax are measures that the country
calls for. There is a necessity and an oppor-
tunity. Opportunity comes sooner or later even
to a person like Bent. If he seizes it, he may be
forgiven everything except his songs.
Some Rude Remarks from Cue.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the camel-clotted distance there’s a fellow
sitting writing,
And the flies are wheeling round him and his I
clothes are very few;
There’s a hint of fire and brimstone in the screed
that he’s inditing—
Aye, a lode of wrath is lurking ’neath hi3 rude
remarks from Cue!
Here’s the letter that he’s scribing—it’s addressed
to those Australians
Who are ambling Pitt or King-street, or are
dawdling round the Block ;
“ Salutations from a grafter, ’mongst the Afghans
and the aliens,
In the intervals of pounding at inhospitable rock !
Salutations from the mulga where the wild bull-
camel rages,
Where the ice-cream doesn’t flourish, and red
dust obscures the view ;
Where the sea’s a misty legend, and no ocean
breeze assuages—
Salutations, sprinkled over with some rude re-
marks from Cue !
“ Past the Day Dawn lies a sandscape where we
dwell in red damnation—
Where we feed the hungry stampers of the foreign
pirate’s mine;
Slaving here for bloated satraps, making our
pawned land’s oblation
To the Jews who sit in London at the banquet
and the wine.
Where the rind of hell is thinnest we are toiling
for a living,
Gouging down through Shed’s bulkheads for our
grim sun-stricken crust;
And away down East in Melbourne politicians in
misgiving
Stroke the tail and pull the whiskers of the
mighty Yankee Trust!
4 He is tame,’ they mumble glibly, all forgetful of
the toilers
Who sweat for Isaac Cohen and the fat importer
crew ;
Who are banished from the foundries and the
mills and looms and boilers—
Who despise the tame-souled leaders, and spit
rude remarks from Cue.
“Driven out and driven further —driven past the
fringe of mulga—
Driven forth to stuff the pockets of the men of
Flinders-lane;
Flinging back our curse in anguish, flinging back
our protest vulgar,
Lo ! we stumble to the shaft-mouth, through the
dust and heat and pain !
4 White Australia ? ’ Strange it soundeth where
the Jap girl hangs the shingle
Of the oldest trade on earth beside the dusty
hurrying street,
Where we struggle through long deserts, while the
whirlwinds rush and mingle,
To the 4 soak ’ wherein the Afghan yester-even
washed his feet ;
Making Asia in Australia, making wreck of all we
cherish —•
Aye, we shudder, looking forward to the future’s
ghastly brew ;
Mixing Chow and Jap and nigger—shall the white
breed pass and perish ?
Will ONE politician hearken to these rude re-
marks from Cue ?
“There’s a microbe of politeness that has bitten
all our leaders,
There’s a blend of milk and water in the legis-
lator’s veins ;
Let some harsh man lift his voice up midst the
roaring stamper-feeders—
Let some rebel run the flag up on Australia’s salt-
bush plains !
For we’re led by dancing-masters, and our leaders
phrase and palter—
Where’s the Voice Australia yearns for —where’s
the Man Australia needs ?
Someone strong who will not fail us—Someone
grim who will not falter,
Towering upwards like a gum-tree ’mongst the
legislative weeds !
There’s a democratic legion that will march
behind that giant—
There’s an army in the mine-stopes that will see
that Leader through ;
There’s an army of Australians, patriotic, straight,
reliant —
Where’s the Leader for that legion ? ” comes the
question rude from Cue.
In the camel-clotted distance there’s a fellow
sitting writing,
And the flies are wheeling round him, and his
clothes are very few;
There’s a lode of strength within him, and his
right arm aches for smiting—
Aches to deal with Jap and Afghan, Yankee
Trust, and foreign Jew !
Here’s the letter that he’s written —it’s addressed
to those Australians
Who are ambling o’er the landscape with no serious
thoughts in stock ;
Here’s the letter that’s indited midst the Afghans
and the aliens,
In the intervals of pounding at inhospitable
rock !
Here’s a cooee from the mulga, where the wild
bull-camel rages,
Where the ice-cream doesn’t flourish, and tho dust
obscures the view ;
Here’s a lusty call to conflict scrawled o’er dry
and blotted pages—
Here’s a Call and here’s a Promise in some Rude
Remarks from Cue !

True to its instincts, Vic. Leg. Council had no
sooner got hold of the Milk Bill than it set about
making things easy for its friend, the filthy dairy-
farmer. Squatter Manifold managed to carry an
amendment providing for the creation of an
“ advisory board,” seemingly designed to advise
the Minister when to go ahead and when to go
slow. Manifold seemed to think his precious
board should consist of farmers, landowners, and
one or two milk-sellers—nothing was said about
the hapless public that has to drink the cow-juice.
Davies, who was in charge of the Bill, told the
Rich Landlords they might as well shelve
it straight out ; but there is little of the
straightforward, practical instinct about the Rich
Landlords, so they passed the amendment, which
they knew quite well Minister Swinburne and
the Assembly wouldn’t accept. It was so like this
precious “House of Review” that, though the
Assembly, the Minister, and the draftsmen had
spent weeks of hard toil in licking the Billinto some
sort of useful shape, the House of Landlords ren-
dered it a mere useless derelict in about 4U minutes.
Returning, next day, the Landlords dealt with the
Pure Food Bill, which, in six hours, they knocked
out of all semblance of use or beauty. Seeing how
the land lay, Minister Davies invited them to
throw out the measure openly, but they merely
smiled fatuously, and told him to get it into com-
mittee. Then they passed Harwood’s motion
that witnesses should be summoned to the bar of
the House to give expert evidence, and postponed
clause after clause pending the examination of the
said experts. By the time these Obstructives
have got their expert evidence and passed their
amendments, and generally mangled the Bill as
they intend, and the Assembly has considered it
once more, and the Rich Landlords have “re-
viewed ” it again, Christmas will be long passed
and the session vanished —which is just what the
Reactionaries want. By the way, one “argu-
ment” of the regrettable Rees was specially
choice ; he objected to the (sealed) tins or bottles
being labelled with their correct weights or
volumes, because “ the contents might evaporate.”
+
Stagnant Maoriland.
A Wellington man writes :
Politics in Maoriland are stagnant, although that
country is just now in the throes of its election campaign.
The air is full of the din of battle. Massey, the cheerful
and good-natured old farmer who yells noisily as the
leader of the Opposition, spent last recess in whirling
round the country in a violent endeavor to unearth
candidates, and nearly every electorate has its Opposition,
candidate warning the electors that ruin is hanging
about outside, and that a loud explosion will occur unless
Seddon is hurled into space. Asked for some particulars
of ruin, they speak vaguely about the curse of autocracy,
and the demoralisation of the public service, and the
fact that “ our credit at Home” is rotten, and that the
climate is not as good as it was, and that Lone Dog Gully
got 6d. more than Cabbage Tree Flat for roads and
bridges, and that Seddon is too big and vast and over-
powering and permanent, anyway.
Seddon is whirling round the country too, only stop-
ping long enough to bellow remarks about “our pro-
sperity,” and predicting such things as a graduated land-
tax, and national pensions, and a free breakfast table, and
an attack on the Harvester Trust. And the Opposition
member, as soon as the dust of Seddon’s passage sub-
sides, and the crowd has come back from cheering him,
faintly states that that isn’t the point, and then the ten
men and the dog pass a vote of thanks and confidence.
The fact is, everything in the nature of immediate
practical politics is finished up with the exception of the
land question. The Labor laws are settled for good ; the
Arbitration Court is only Half employed and will soon be
able to go to smoke its pipe, in the garden ; the bona-fide
traveller is dead and buried ; the liquor law is flawless at
last and out of the hands of politicians (candidates merely
make the stereotyped and satisfactory reply that it is not
in politics any more, and that it doesn’t concern them),
and a blessed peace broods over the political landscape in
spite of the loud howls of the Opposition about nothing
in particular, arid its frantic assault on ghosts that don’t
exist.
Tiie land question remains’, and it is a real trouble.
The country party in the just-dissolved Parliament had a
freehold majority, and Seddon is sitting on the rail. He
has left the whole State wondering whether lie is a lease-
holder or a freeholder —these are Maoriland’s terms of
differentiation betvveen the supporter of the conservation
of Crown Lands (by only leasing them) and the advocate
of their dissipation (by allowing the tenant the option of
purchase). Three years ago Seddon was a land nationaliser.
He has been everything since, and sometimes he has been
two opposites at once. One thing is certain —he will not
make the land tenure a question of policy yet, and
although he has stated 259 different policies, they are all
so cleverly put that he will be able, if he declares
eventually for leasehold, to say that he never advocated
anything else and that for the 260th time he must repeat
it.
It is a moral certainty that next Parliament will be a
leasehold Parliament, and one can already hear Seddon
preparing to jump. It will be the one clear issue at the
elections, because there are no other issues. And that
settled, there is nothing for Maoriland to do in the legis-
lative line except begin decorating and adding the
luxuries of Democracy. Seddon’s majority will be about
the same as before, in everyone’s opinion—about 54 to 26
—but Massey is telling interviewers that there is a great
wave of revulsion coming, and that the country will
declare the doom of Seddon by giving him only 53 seats
this time, And this wave is whirling along with such
fearful velocity that Seddon will be certainly kicked out
in 15 more years.
And in all this joyous shriek there isn’t a word to
show that the writer realises that Maoriland may
soon have to face a bigger problem than even the
land question—the borrowing question. A State
that, while on the topmost wave of prosperity,
still borrows some £2,000,000 a year, which owes
about £60,000,000 (nearly £7O per inhabitant),
which steals the sinking fund regularly, and
which, to a great extent, makes its surpluses
nowadays by not charging revenue with ordinary
repairs to public works, will yet strike something
that will make it realise that politics are not
finished and dead—not by 10,000 miles. Did
neither party in Maoriland ever hear of honest
finance ?

Self-respecting Defence.
The establishment of a Vic. Division of the Aus-
tralian National Defence League is to be discussed
at a preliminary meeting in Melbourne Town
Hall, called for Friday of: this week. The first
resolution, which Prime Minister Deakin will
move, meets any objection that might have been
raised by democrats of the Peace Party order,
whose anti-Jingoism takes fright at the thought
of training every able-bodied Australian to the
use of the rifle. Deakin is to move—
That a division of the N.D.L. be formed in Victoria, on a
non-party basis, with a view of creating and fostering
amongst Australians a healthy and vigorous public senti-
ment as to the duties of citizens in respect to the defence
of hearth and home under conditions which will minimise
the evils of militarism, and so obviate, as far as possible,
the need’ of a standing army,
Originated seemingly bj citizen Marshall Lyle,
the Vic. movement is openly anti-jingo in
purpose. At the present time there are 350
rifle clubs scattered about Victoria with a
total. membership of 16,000, and the attitude
of the frilly military authorities towards these un-
pretentious amateur pioneers in national defence
work dan be judged from the fact that the Vic-
torian Government, taking its cue froiri the local
army figureheads, has cut down its annual vote to
the. rifle clubs to about one-half of the former

PARTY GOVERNMENT CONDENSED.
sent conditions, a man who wants to become a
practical defender of bis country without itching
to fight for the blessed Umpire is required to buy
his own rifle and pay his own travelling expenses
incidental to shooting practice. The idea of the
Victorian Defence League is to extend the civilian
club movement and promote a valuable system of
physical culture among the young—in short, to
improve the country’s manhood whilstrencouraging
every man to become a proficient rifle shot.
Cadets under the present military system get
only a.course of idiotic drill and a lamentable in-
fusion -A>f Jingo-spirit. The League proposes to
develop muscle and national sentiment in
the boys. Its platform is supported by all sorts of
representative men. Oh the provisional committee
the assortment of names is humorously com-
prehensive. Senator Best and O. R. Snow-
ball, brother Orangemen, figure beside Dr.
Maloney and Higgins, the aggressive apostle t>f
Peace. Maugher. Prendergast, Knox, and T.
Skene are there, likewise the names of Gaunson
and two or three parsons crop up amongst the
motley gathering. The speakers at the meeting
will be the Prime Minister, Waxcellency Madden,
the A.N. A. president, Scott (of the Trades Hall
Council), Watson, Hughes, Bent, &c., &c.
♦
The Stout Chow.
For years, the better class of Chinamen in Aus-
tralia, assisted by religious and philanthropic
bodies, have been agitating for the prohibition of
opium; and about 12 months ago the State Premiers
decided to introduce simultaneous legislation deal-
ing with the question. That agreement has not
been carried out, but Victoria lias gone so far as-to
frame a measure covering its share of the business.
The Opium Bill passed the Assembly and went on
to the Reformed House of Well-to-Do Persons.
There it has been stuck up for several weeks,
owing to an agitation on the part of the fat
Chinese opium-importing merchants of Melbourne.
This Bill originally provided that the sale, posses-
sion, or smoking of opium should become an
offence after Feb. 1, and the Chow importer, like
his Caucasian brother, started to yelp that he
would be ruined, owing to the large stock of opium
now on hand. That wail found a large number of
remnants of the old House of 48 Rich Landlords
to support it. Even the godly Balfour, a member
of the Presbyterian Assembly, who had been
foremost in his denunciations of “ the dia-
bolical traffic which was ruining body and
soul,” arose to do his little turn on .behalf of
the poor Chow importer, who would lose through
not being able to kill bodies and souls a
little longer. That the contention of the mer-
chants and their apologists was utterly untenable
is manifest from the fact that they have had a
year’s warning that the traffic is to cease, and
an ultimatum of three months from the date when
the measure was introduced into the Assembly.
More important than all, there would be nothing in
their contention had the prohibition been carried
into effect at a day’s notice, seeing that the other
-States have not yet fallen into line, and conse-
quentlyall opium held in Victoria could be exported
to meet the demands and undermine the constitu-
tions of the rest of Australia. Nevertheless, the
barrackers for the extended “sapping- of bodies
and souls by the hellish compound ” were so strong
that Attorney-General Davies had to back down
and accept May las a compromise. The worst
feature of the whole business is its trickery. The
agitation was conducted, not on behalf of the
Melbourne merchants who could have lost
nothing, hut in the interests of the one big Chow
monopolist of Hong Kong. This Pierpont
Morgan of the opium trade has, in bond, in
Melbourne, a large quantity of opium consigned
to various local firms. The packages could be
returned to Hong Kong without any Australian
duty being collected or any loss to the fat Chow
at Plong Kong other than transport charges. But
these would have to be paid by the fat Chow of
Hong Kong, and therefore his fat brethren of the
Victorian Upper House combined to foist upon
the lowly Chow, of Melbourne, the drug it had
just decided was killing him. ihe pious members
of the Vic. Upper House would prefer to destroy
a few more souls rather than that a base mercan-
tile wretch engaged in ruining his fellow creatures
should have to pay double freight on his package
of iniquity and get it returned on his hands.
—
It most likely won’t be long before Tasmania will
find out what an ass its House of Dodeky was in
throwing out the Bill to control friendly societies,
on the ground of “ undue interference with
people’s business.” Such returns as Tasmanian
friendly societies do furnish show that the total
funds per member are only £7 19s. Gel., as against
£l4 Ills. Id. per member in Victoria, where for
some years past the business has been run on an
actuarial basis ; and se ing that .Tasmanian
societies consist mostly of old men, Dodeky having
driven the young ones out of the country, it s
pretty certain that Tasmanian societies ought to
have more accumulated funds than the Victorian
ones instead of less. Before S. Australia inter-
fered with people s business ” and put the societies
on a proper footing, many of them had had to
slam the door in the face of ancient greybeards
who came along on their crutches to draw the
benefits they had paid for ; and apparently
the Tasmanian Do lderers want the same thing to
happen there. Well, it looks from the figures as
though they won’t have to wait long.

Mr. Tanqueray, who married Pinero’s
second Mrs. Tanqueray, was always reckoned a
good deal of an ass, yet surely not such an ass as
to marry the woman whom Miss Tittell Prune
represented in Sydney at Her Majesty’s on Satur-
day night. The previous conception of the lady
was almost entirely Tanqueray’s own idea of her—
a very clever person with a very had kink, which
made her. hold and express the most upside-down
opinions upon almost everything. Miss Brune
represents her essentially as a private-bar sort of
lady, “loud’’and “flash a rampageous creature
who wasn’t likely to care two straws whether color-
less step-daughter Elleari cared for her or not; who,
in fact, would be much more likely to want to
stuff the youngster away in the coal-scuttle than
have her fussing about and interfering with her
pleasures. Further, from such a woman Pinero’s
dialogu'tfis not to be expected ; she surely wouldn’t
use keen little .daggers—her blows would be more
likely to be struck with an axe or an empty wine-
bottle. From all of which it may be judged that
Paula Tanqueray isn’t one of Miss Brune’s striking
successes. Passing over the general conception,
however, and getting to the detail, little fault can
be found. The plans are bad, but, such as they
are, she works them out well; and when Satur-
day night's audience got used to the new
idea—which took it the better part of
half the'play—it applauded her work warmly.
Inevitably, however, she has to fail some-
times. ’.The passage with Mrs. Cortelyon,
avhen tlnit .buzzing old soul from over the way
looks in the ice, is unreal, simply because
the new Mrs. Tanqueray is using language which
is intended for quite another ’sort of Mrs. Tan-
qu >ray. Yet, in spite of these things, the general
effect is far less incongruous than might be ex-
pected.
Albert Gran’s Cayley Drummle, though it
has touches of the same sort of melodrama treat-
ment —one almost dreads at the start that Cayley
is going to act “comic relief’’—turns out one of
the successes of the performance. Redgrave is a
passable but youngish Tanqueray, who tries to
shrug himself out of difficulties ; and Miss Susie
Vaughan paints Mrs. Cortelyon with broad
strokes, yet effectively. To a great extent, the
new treatment puts “ Saint ” Ellean (Miss Flor-
ence Gleeson) out of the picture.
* * * •
Saturday night next witnesses J.C.W.’s
first Australian production of the much-talked-of
“Leah Kleschna,” at Her Majesty’s (Sydney),
with Miss Brune in the name-part.
** * *
The revival of “Sunday,” played four
times at Her Majesty's last week tofillinagap, sup-
plied, curiously enough, a much better “ Sunday
than when it wasn’t merely filling in a gap.
There were reasons for expecting that it wouldn t
be as good —that, for one thing, the “art” which
Miss Brune has learned since she opened in this
comparatively poor yet ruggedly-strong piece in-
Australia, would spoil the naturalness with which
she won her first big success here. But there was
no trace of that, and the part still stands as one
of her very best. The cast was little different
from the old one, except that Douglas Gerrard
played “.Tacky.” Gerrard seems to have been
unfortunate in having made his first Australian
appearance as Launcelot in “Merely Mary Ann.”
From his long association with that piece one
judged him from what he did in it; and it is very
clear that he can do much better.
** * *
At Sydney Royal “The Battle and the
Breeze” on Saturday gives place to “ Through the
Divorce Court,” which is said to be a soul-stirring
domestic drama. Sydney lately hasn’t been able
to take its old pleasure in the Divorce Court owing
to the prohibition of press reports of the “spicy
bits”; and this drama should fill a gap for a
while.
* * *• *
For the last week the posters advertising
“ The Postmistress of the Czar ”, put on at Sydney
Palace by Miss Lily Dampier and her co., have
caused a block of traffic—horse and foot. A
public that loves to be thrilled stops its lorry to
gaze; and the telegraph boy carrying a death
message marked “Urgent” pauses, stops whist-
ling, stands on one foot, and adds himself to the
group of women and children Who are all eyeing the
one picture—a woman bending over footprints in
the snow. At another place near the kerb another
group glues awestruck eyes on a picture of a con-
vict coming out of an iron safe. But the most
curdlesome tableau of all is that of a rosebud little
girl, in a red frock and pelisse, being walloped
with a full-sized knout by a gentleman in the
uniform of an officer of the Czar. These pictures
give an inkling of the drama’s merits as a baby-
frightener. It is styled an Anglo-Russian
drama, and was produced for the first
time last Wednesday. The plot has more
convolutions, twists and knots than a hundred
fathoms of kelp. A Russian Prince is secietly
married to a Jewess, although he is betrothed to a
Princess named Olga. A police spy, Sergius,
blinds the Prince with vitriol because a wicked
uncle—are uncles in drammers ever good ?
wants his estates. Sergius gets into the
soup himself, and by way of giving the Prince
truly uncongenial company the pair are sent
chained together to Siberia. Act 11. shows
Sergius, well-uniformed in the clothes of an officer
he has killed, coming into the log-built post-office
on the road to Siberia to steal the bag of gold
that the postmistress of the Czar has obligingly
left hanging near an unlocked window. The
Jewish wife is “working” in this office, but
the Princess Olga, who has also somehow contrived
to be penalised, is the boss. The assistant is
murdered by Sergius, and he is tinkering with the
telegraph tape when the blind and princely con-
vict comes in and interrupts him. The thief is
fully armed with revolver and sword, the blind
convict has onlv his white hands. But do the
bullets strike him? Not if he knows himself!
He pursues the ai med burglar round and round the
counter, and would catch him if a horde of police
and lanterns didn’t intrude. The little child of
the murdered woman now comes down stairs and
denounces Sergius as a villain, and the curtain
drops, whilst the audience hopes that in the next
act it will see Sergius being Hayed alive. But S.
is no common man. When the next act begins he
is dressed in fresh clothes, and forging passports at
the palace of the Governor-General in St. Peters-
burg. Also he is friendly with the G.-G. Through
the death of the Czar certain political prisoners are
pardoned, the Prince among them. So he gets
back his uniform, if not his sight. Also, he
is free to wed the noble Olga. “ Your
career of crime is ended. Answer now to the
laws of your country,” says one of the characters
when the dramatist has exhausted himself and
has nary another climax secreted about his
person. The two Dampier girls, Percy Walshe.
Alfred Rolfe, Edmund Holloway, S. A. Fitzgerald,
and Alf. Dampier, junr., sustain the weight of a
very exciting and very confused play, and the part
of a little child is well done by small Sybil Miller.
The beauty of some of the scenery is a good adver-
tisement for the Russian tourist bureau, if there
be such a department.

All th.e leading Jewish families were represented

“lolanthe,” revived at Sydney Criterion
after a very brief interval since its last production,
proved again the never-fading charm of Gilbert
and Sullivan’s work. It is in the variety of it?
appeals to the public that a work of this sort
■cores. The musicianly are attracted by the ex-
cellent orchestration, the melodious solos and con-
certed numbers; for others there is the attraction
of the gay and sparkling wit, showing in the appeal
to “scorn not the nobly born for hearts as pure may
be found in Belgrave Square as in the lowly air of
Seven Dials” ; for yet others the broad burlesque
of the House of Peers and its brass band. In this
re.ival the chorus work is again notably good-
Among the principals Kenmngham stands out so
strongly as an artistic singer as to rather put
the others in the shade (except Vernon, whose
humor the years do not stale). But
De Loitte gives a pretty picture of lolant e
and Miss Celia Ghiloni, though the music does
not fit her voice, is a fine figure of a Fairy Quee
and acts with an impressiveness and humor that
help much to the success of the production, whils
Miss Castles is an attractive Areacban shep-
herdess. Walter Crane is rather heavy j( as
Strephon. For next Saturday 1 riuces. 11

Leroy, Talma and Bosco still hold the fort

they will produce a full-sized Customs tariff they

“With Flying Colors,” first produced at
Melbourne Royal four years ago, took the stage
again last Saturday. This is a strong, deserving
melodrama which presents a smooth surface of
exaggerated probability to Bland Holt’s public,
and works upon their feelings until they come to
regard the principal evil-doer as a personal enemy
and are sorry to think his murderer will be
hanged. Critically considered, in his character of
the man who causes trouble all round, the
villain (Albert Norman), has only one weak-
ness—the same old failing that marks the
lurid miscreants in lower-grade melodramas. He
has a ridiculous lust for creating unpleasantness.
He goes too far with things. Finally he goes to a
lonely cottage for the purpose of pressing his un-
welcome attentions on a gentle Mary (Miss Ross)
—the last thing a brave, practical, cold-blooded
villain would think of doing. Whilst he is com-
mitting this foolish error, one of his indignant
male victims, who has just escaped from
penal servitude, arrives, puts the light out, and
murders him with great success. In the midst
of gloom he is in death. Then the prison warders
recapture poor Styan, whilst Walter Baker, who
is also a convict at large, proves his innocence by
embracing Mary aforesaid.
'** * *
The cottage scene and the preceding prison
scenes, where the chief convicts toy with bricks
and mortar and have stirring interviews with
their relations, are good, honest melodrama,
brightened by touches of human nature. Also,
the murder of a nautical person by Norman in the
Ist act is a well-built episode that carries the
criminal along to his bitter end. And the inter-
vening scenes have ingenuity and spectacular
effects to recommend them. Nobody troubles to
explain why this long pale of woe has a cheerful
title, but doubtless it is Baker whose colors are
warranted to fly. Baker repeats his frequent
character of an unsuspecting hero in uniform,
and Miss Ross is the faithful Mary de-
voted to his cause. Styan plays the
penitent embezzler, Lotan Hackett, who
makes tender appeals for his wife’s affection all
the time that she is unaccountably attached to
Norman, the villain ; and Miss Harrie Ireland is
the wife aforesaid. She puts herself right with
the audience towards the finish by turning vindic-
tive and telling her husband to get even with the
other fellow. Four years ago Miss Ireland was a
smiling novice in bad-woman parts, but since then
she has become hardened to them. She has been
often knifed and strangled, and pulled around the
room by her auburn hair, so she feels her wicked-
ness and gives it full expression. Bland and Mrs.
Holt are minor features of the performance,
getting in their comic relief at long intervals, and
the other members of the co. give assistance more
or less valuable.

At Melbourne Princess’s there will be
another week of “In the Bishop’s Carriage” ere
Miss Nellie. Stewart packs up her defiant red hat
and leaves Melbourne for an indefinite period.
The circle and the stalls are not unduly crowded
these nights, but the amphitheatre is full of
admiration for the burglar’s chaste donah who
takes to the stage and blossoms into a Bernhardt
after a few rehearsals. By the way, this is at
least the fifth drama in which Nellie Stewart
has impersonated a theatrical star of one
sort or other, but in the present instance she
abandons the “purfesh ” when the young laurels
are green upon her brow, merely because the
burglar tried to take her character away. The
shock is so great that she quits her lodgings, and
gets temporarily lost in a Home for 111-Used
Children, where the weak-kneed Bishop achieves
her rescue. The play may be said to owe every-
thing to the dear old Bishop. At the outset he
brings the fair pickpocket to light in his carriage,
and later on he restores her to his friends by
means of the same vehicle.

“ Veronique,” as was remarked last week,
is growing in popular estimation at Her Majesty’s,
Melbourne. All the same, popular estimation
is unsympathetic soil for a foreign musical plant
now that it has been fed for years with British
bone dust. “ Veronique ” doesn’t grow as rapidly
as a mushroom. The butcher-boy with a large
flat ear for music can’t catch the melodies of the
new opera as promptly as he caught the “ Rajah
of Bhong ” or “ Tell me, Pretty Maiden.” They
hadn’t the barrel-organ quality of “The Bull
and Bush.” But they will grow in time. Mean-
while, “Veronique” is doing an immense busi-
ness on Saturday nights, like the Sorcerer, who
sold penny cakes at thirteen a shilling.

. Princes Court stands where it did, rejoic-
ing in the belated arrival of warm weather, and
the sunshine of Melbourne’s very nicest patronage.
Something special is about to be introduced at
the Court, and a personage of distinction will
perform the opening ceremony. The Corrick
family, supported by colored pictures, is giving
its entertainment at the Athenreum Hall, but
the Circuses have jointly and severally
gone away. The closing show at Wirths’
Circus afforded further cause for public
dissatisfaction with the colored members of this
mostly white Commonwealth. Brother Gunga
Brahm had undertaken to wrestle three falls with
Clarence Weber. In less than two minutes Weber
laid the oily Hindu flat upon his back, whereupon
somebody announced that the black man was
suffering from a cold (which was nobody’s business
hut his own) and would not carry out the rest of
his contract. This was everybody’s business, and
they growled accordingly. Gunga’s alleged indis-
position looked very like an attempt to belittle the
victory of the white man, and anyway it was no
excuse for his refusal to get beaten in a satisfactory
way. If he was capable of 'losing one fall he
wasn’t too ill to lose another. The present scribe
would be game to collapse before Haekenscbmidt
five times in one minute even if he had three colds.

At the Opera House, the same people as
before have made alterations in their “turns,” or
some of them have. The Graham and Dent
sketch is changed, sadly changed, and Hill and
Whitaker are doing a banjo duet. But the larky
smile of the lady retains its original charm, and
she still desires de congregation to stand up. If
she were to try to get away without singing her
coon song de congregation wouldn’t let her.

Rickards having closed his experimental
season at Adelaide Tivoli, Ryder Slone, Boy Glen
of the startled eyes and the Lancashire accent,
Spry and the rest have moved on to regions more
hospitable. Charles Holloway battles along at
the Royal, and has replaced “ Shall We Forgive
Her C’(which is now so old that the lady seems
likely to die before the question is decided, though
its very age gives it a certain freshness) -by the
sentimental thrill. “Two Little Vagabonds.” And
all that portion of the community which can afford
to pay more than two shillings for its seat treats
the theatre as though it' didn’t exist.
THE METEOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
H a meteor of light,
Fell a-blazing
thro’ the night ;
And ivc gazed upon
the sight,
You and I.
And you pointed to
a star.
In the spaces set afar,
And you said, “ True
lovers are
Such as they."
And I read your
meaning through,
And I found your
moral true,
And I said: “ Then
what of you —
You and me l ”
Then you said ■'
‘'This earth is me,
And that meteor was
thee,
And the central
gravity
Is in me.”
Then we laughed, as
loters do
When their love is
strange and new ;
For we never thought
to rue
Byand-bye.
O, I’m gazing back
upon
Pleasant days long
dead and gone ;
And the light oj
them is wan
With their grief.
When I gaze into the pall
Of the night, and see the fall
Of a planet, I recall
All you said.
For your metaphor was true,
That you dragged me down to you
And I fell, as- mortals do,
To my doom.
N.S.W.
THE MOOCHER.
AT POVERTY POINT.
After Amy Cashes’ re-appearance at Queen’s Hall the
other day, the London papers loudly sang her praises
and the Daily News predicted enthusiastically that she
will be the soprano of the future. Apparently little
Amy has arrived in real earnest.
After Grant Hervey bad recklessly slaughtered the
bluestone wall of a public-house in Bourke-street, Mel-
bourne, .and had been arrested on a charge of intending
to bruise Blandolt’s only Walter Baker, an enterprising
tradesman offered' a reward to anyone who found the
bullet. Twenty-one people, with Webley revolver bullets
in various stages of smash, came in to claim the reward ;
but the tradesman failed to identify any of them as the
shot that slew the public-house. So no business resulted
“G.S.”: Australian version of “In the Bishop’s Car-
riage ” omits the most dramatic situation in the bbok.
Nance Olden—those who have read the book will ren: em-
ber—visits the.office of the great New York theatrical
entrepreneur, canoodles his private secretary who is an
unrestrained hard, drinker, and abstracts from the great
one’s desk the document demonstrating the existence of
the theatrical ring.- There’s a fine situation, and the s\ar
has the stage to herself, too. Can’t remember a stronger
situation of the kind since Countess Zicka got tampering
with the dispatch-box in “ Diplomacy.” There’s a reason,
I suppose, why that situation goes out.
“ Adelaide ” writes : —“ ‘ When we were Twenty-one,’
making- its first appearance on an Adelaide stage,
shows the familiar Esmond device of g-eneric names
(‘ The Imp,’ ‘ The Soldier-man,’ etc.), and of the nice girl
throwing over the youth in favor of the middle-aged man.
But authors are practically forced into the latter device
these times, to appeal to the vanity of middle-aged actor-
managers. The Imp is 21, and the four men who act as
his parents and guardians all reminiscently wish they
were. Hence the title —but nothing further comes of
that. The Imp is somehow engaged to Phyllis, but has
come under the spell of a really notorious Variety lady,
who fig-ures in scarlet costume, and not much of it, on
the hoardings. There is one such picture right opposite
the windows of Oarew’s flat (where all the action takes
place), and much business turns on this. Oarew is the
strong man of the four guardians, and in despair he goes
to buy off the lady by bribing her heavily to pass as his
own property for a month or so. Arranged accordingly.
When the Imp, who meant matrimony, is at his throat,
enter the scarlet person’s true but long-lost husband, and
all is well. The Imp goes off to some unspecified war—
to kill a few perfect strang-ers is the regular dramatic
cure for a broken heart —and Phyllis, who has shown all
along that she really prefers Carew, manages to convince
him of the fact. The joke of the whole- thing to the
initiated was that the capable amateurs who produced
the play-cut out of it bodily the third act—the only' one
in which the Scarlet Woman appears, with her past and
her presents, the awkward bargaining with Oarew, and
the boudoir, and the French maid who says ‘ Damn ! ’
Playing solely to invited guests, they feared that the
scene of devilry by' night would not be 1 nice.’ Carew,
Phyllis, and The Imp had representatives who would not
be out of place in professional company. Adelaide is very
strong in amateurs just now.”
Who originated the yarn that Melba had lost her voice
for ever; and was returning to Victoria to hide her di-
minished head '! There’s nothing the matter with Melba’s
voice. She sang, the other week, in “La Boheme ” for
the opening of a winter opera season at Oovent Garden,
and all the dukes and duchesses went to hear her, as
usual. The following week she sang at the Bristol Fes-
tival.
James Stew'art, mixed up with Brisbane theatres from
a date so long ago that it is almost forgotten, dropped off
recently'. Twenty-five years ago he leased the old Gaiety
; Theatre in Adelaide-street—there is no theatre so sad-
fooking that someone won’t call it Gaiety—where he
catered for the revellers during the boom. Ten years ago
he took up the management of the Roy'al, and stuck to
that job till a few weeks ago, when his health broke down.
Lily Hall Caine, sister of Thomas Henry' Hail Caine
(that’s his full name), appears at -Drury Lane (London), as
the wronged heroine in the early part -of her brother’s
much-boomed bellowdrama, “The Prodigal Son.” When
the heroine has succumbed under a load of troubles, Miss
Caine is transformed into her (the heroine’s) daughter.
Hall’s sister has been in the profession for about 12 years,
and has play'ed without extraordinary success parts
ranging from comic opera to Elizabethan drama. In
“The Prodigal Sou” she attracts less attention than
Nancy Price, who impersonates a bold, bad woman, and
whose rich reddish hair sends the critics into paroxysms
of delight. Harrie Ireland’s hair would probably affect
Australian pressmen in the same way' if she were an.
imported actress. As she is only a remarkably' fine local
product, such inky raptures are seldom laid at her feet.
“Amateur”: Why don’t these actor men who are con-;
tinually being called upon to wipe out their enemies with
one blow study a little the art of laying on of hands?
Ilarcourt Beatty, in “The Bishop’s'Carriage,” enters
casually', and knocks a thick-skulled criminal clean out
with an absurd punch on the head, just where it would
do the bad man the least possible mischief, and do most
mischief to the delicate knuckles of the gentle hero.
Then, when the gaol-bird recovers, and is threatening
devilment, Mr. Beatty, shaping with his hands down,
informs the big, strong- brute that he is about to give him
the thrashing of his life-time. Even Walter Baker,
who is much of a stage man-eater, frivols with the gloves
like a boxing bullock.
The cable-impression that Irving died on the stage or
in the wings, and that his last words v\ ere from the play,
“Into Thy' hands, O Lord,” was yards away from the
mark. “Becket” over, he undressed and dressed.
Entering the cab at the stage door, he said to his valet:
“ Will you come with me?” When they'arrived at the hotel
the valiet.noticed that Irving leaned very-heavily on his
arm. He sank into a chair in the hall, and w'as evidently
ill. Dr. Carroll was sent for. Meanwhile Irving reclined
on a couch, and lapsed into insensibility'. When the
doctor arrived he was dead.
Not long- before his death Henry' Irving- related, at a
private gathering in Glasgow, a remarkable occurrence
which has never appeared in jorint, save once in the
columns of a Glasgow newspaper. The conversation
turned on “ doubles,” and Irving related that on one
occasion the body of a woman was recovered from the
Thames, and noticed by the river police as bearing a re-
markable resemblance to Miss Ellen Terry, who at that
time was temporarily off the stage. Irving was sent for
to view the body, and had no hesitation in identifying it
as that of Miss Terry. This identification was further
corroborated by her husband, and the body was buried as
hers. The real Ellen Terr.v returned, and declined to
be regarded as dead ; but the identity of her double
was never discovered.
“Stony”: The person-.who execrates the stage-frilkiin.
is still about town. At a Melbourne playho%Ae,,one*
recent night, a god leaped up from bis uneasy
as the persecuted sufferer on the stage was beg.t ulwS
pass his last moments beneath a heavy cardboard inullyV
wielded by the villain of the piece. “ M,v God ! ” shrieH&i
the god, “ I ivon't see that man murdered ! ” And the*
meaty thud of the falling mallet was drowned in a roaring
flood of laughter.
One of Victoria’s most ancient theatrical landmarks was
auctioned for removal the other day, when the remains of
the old Princess Theatre, of Bendigo, came under the
hammer. The Princess, which was identical with the
Criterion and the Haymarket, was Bendigo’s first theatre,
althoughses.tablished originally as a mere adjunct to the
Criterion Hotel. It was here that Thatcher bellowed his
parodies and somewhat blue topical songs to approving
diggers, who sat at small tables drinking for the good of
the house and for their own particular mischief. It was
at the Haymarket that Cola Montes played on the much-
quoted occasion when Jupiter acted as limelight man and
provided lightning and thunder to lend realism to
“ The Little Devil.” Madame Oarandini, and Misses Urie
and Hayes, Avonia Jones, and G. V. Brooke, and other
celebrities, appeared in the Haymarket in the middle
fifties, when gold was handled like dirt in Bendigo.
The theatre, stripped of its simple embellishments,
drifted out of the service of the Muses, and degenerated
into a hay and corn store. Old hands still enthuse over
the magnificence of the talent at the Criterion and Hay-
market, but, in point of fact, the gold-diggers of the
Roaring Fifties made the least exacting audiences on
earth. They asked of the theatre and musical hall only'
a medium for expressing their own exuberance, and,
excepting on rare occasions, the audience was much more
entertaining- than the artists.
“ Cockaigne ” : Dillon and Fechter paved the way for
Irving. The breach they made was by natural acting, as
opposed to the traditional, which had descended from
Macready to Phelps, Sullivan, Brooke, Creswick, and
Anderson. Irving gloated over the Shakspearian pro-
ductions at Sadler’s Wells, but formed his style on the
French performers who visited the St. James’s, especially
Lafont. However, the lessons of William Hoskins were
valuable, in technique. I have read the history of the
Edinburgh Theatre Royal, with casts of the plays
while Irving- was there, 1856 to 1859. lie was walk-
ing- gentleman, the position formerly held there
by Barry Sullivan, to whom as a star Irving acted.
There is the record of his acting a female witch in the
Christmas pantomime. In 1859 he had a fitful appearance
with a little part in “ Ivy Hall ” at the Princess’s, London.
Then he returned to the provinces for seven years. Phil
Day told me he acted with G. V. Brooke and Irving
together at Cambridge. Irving returned to London with
a leading position at the St. James’s. He was the original
Compton Kerr in “ Formosa”, at Drury Lane. Made his
footing secure at the Queen’s with Toole, Wyndham,
etc. Dickens there praised, his Bill Sikes. Went up
the ladder with Digby Grant in “Two Roses,”
at the Vaudeville, in 1870. Then came his dis-
astrous blow under Bateman at the Lyceum. Opened
there in “ Fanchon,” a mere feeder to one of the
Miss Batemans. Play failed. Irving made a little stir as
Jingle in “Pickwick.” Persuaded Bateman, with a good
deal of trouble, to stage “The Bells.” Overwhelming
hit. Salary raised from £l5 to £35. “Charles 1.,”
“ Eugene Aram,” and “Richelieu ” advanced him. Then
“ Hamlet,” 200 nights. His management of the Lyceum
was financed by Baroness Bux-dett-Coutts, who used to be
very palpable in the stage box. Suddenly she deserted
him. Rumor says Charles Kean proposed marriage to
her about 30 years before. Probably nonsense. For
five years—’66 to ’71 —Irving was only regarded
in London with some curiosity as an actor.
This was after 10 yeai-s’ previous experience, so that
merely luck evinced his transcendent ability, at the age of
33. Not long before the demolition of the Lyceum, the
accumulated scenery for all his magnificent productions
was burnt in a warehouse. His genius can best be
compared with that of Lemaitre, the Frenchman. His
wife was a Miss Neligan. They separated. She kept the
two boys, H.B. and Lawrence. Afterwards Irving took
charge of them, and for 15 years, at all evexits, both have
been devoted in their affection for him. The mantle
falls on H.B.
“J.A.C.”: Away back in the’7o’s, there used to tour
the United Kingdom a team of clown cricketers. I have
seen them play, or rather, I have not seen them play, for
they could not play ; they never won a game, but their
monkey tricks amused the spectators. They did not last
very long, for devout cricketing enthusiasts could not
suffer such profanation. They were all clowns of renown
in pantomime and circus. Among their number were
Bimbo, G. Budd, Dale, Butler, the Brothers Alvens and
Banvard, Hurry and E. Crouste, all of whom have now
pretty well disappeai-ed. The poor clown is not nowadays
the deity he used to be ; pantomime harlequinades are all
but obsolete, and the circus humorist is, more often than
not, a sad spectacle., x ~
A press chiffonier discovers that in November, just 50
years ago, manag-er Torning was making money by “ Jack
Sheppard” in the Victoria Theatre, near the School of
Arts, in Pitt-street, Sydney, and spent his off-time
defending the morals of his play. “ The audience cer-
tainly appreciates this piece,” writes Andrew Torning,
“and hundreds of highly-respectable people are loud in
its praise.” Ditto, after 50 3'ears, with William Anderson
and “ Thunderbolt.”
The Duchess of Sutherland was the “anonymous”
authoress of a foolishly dull play with which manager
Forbes Robertson opened a beaxxtiful London theatre the
other week. And now the sox-rowful manager is trying
to persuade himself that he accepted the play on its
wondrous literary merits, without knowing for certain
that the dear Duchess had sent it along. He can’t admit
the possibility of a duchess’s play being- l-ighteously d —d.
“ Hassam ” : Amin full agreement with “ Skull’s ’’senti-
ment (B. 12-10-5), re the disgraceful prevalence of stage
misalliances between the white (colored) and brown,
black, yellow, ringstraked and spotted (discolored) varie-
ties of our species. The one blot on the fair fame of the
late lamented Bard of Avon is the unpleasant scene of
Othello pawing- the missus. It is true that Desdemona
receives the orthodox wages of sin for crossing the color-
line. And as such the play is a healthy warning, although
I do not think W. Shakspeare had his eye on the moral.
His slaughter of the lady so early in her career of infamy
was for artistic rather than ethical reasons. The poet’s
eye, in a fine frenzy rolling, conjured up visions of divers
parti-colored infants and piebald domesticity. So she
had to die. But, if you will observe, Desdemona was not
an Englishwoman, but a Dag-o.Shakspeare was, at any
rate, a patriot. So I suppose, on the whole, I must for-
give him ; but I’m — : — if I forgive the perpetration of
that Oingalee atrocity.
“ Hamer E.M.K.” tells of his experience with a
dramatic co. some of whose members got ptomaine poison-
ing-. In another dramatic show we had a man who
suffered perpetually from a different vai-iety of poisoning.
He used to get mixed up in many things, and when a man
had been stabbed by the villain in the first act this person
would refer to him in the second act as a suicide, and in
the third as some one drowned at seaJ But he-carried.his
mistakes off with an air that convinced the audiences, and
he had a voice that told them something was happening.
The ti-agedy arrived when lie wasplaying- a railway porter
in an accident scene, and the excitement carried him back
to the night before, when he had been a sea captain. He
demanded that blue lights should be burned, and boats
lowered and sails reefed, until the stage manager got riled
and taking advantage of the darkened stage threw props
at him. Then he -made a rush through tlxe scenery, and
prematurely wrecked the train, and brought down the
cui-tain on a scene of dissolution and blasphemy.
The yearning of the Owe’Sullivan to be
benevolent to tbe people of N.S.W. at the public
expense is incurable. This is his latest motion :
Referring to the old 9d. per acre selections (or leases)
taken up before 1875 —some of them as far back as 1862-
3-4—will he take steps to have these converted into free-
holds, in view of the fact that more than their value has
been paid to the State ?
Is he aware that though the value of some of these
blocks is only 12s per acre, more than 30s. per acre has
already been paid upon them?
As the price of Crown land was long since fixed at £1
per acre, with interest added, does he not see the occu-
piers of these old holdings are paying more than other
people for Crown lands ?
The man who gets land worth 12s. per acre for a
rental of 9d. is really paying just about 6 per
cent. ; where the land is worth £1 an acre he is
only paying about per cent. The terms don’t
seem extortionate. If Owe’Sullivan had a house
woi th £5OO, and it had been let for 40 years at
£3O a year, would he now feel called on to make
the tenant a present of the house because said
tenant had already paid £l2OO for a building
worth less than half tlxat sum ?
THE MUMMER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Those mummer men in Parliament,
They run deceitful shows ;
They pull the artless Public’s leg,
And lead it by the nose.
Great battles they pretend to fight,
They wave their arms a lot;
In language loud and impolite
They voice their views of Wrong and Right
The dramas they perform at night
Are merest tommy rot.
Rehind the scenes in Parliament
Those mummers legislate ;
Behind the scenes they pledge their votes,
And fix affairs of State.
But party wars they still must wage,
Which matter not a jot.
The prompter rings ; they take the stage ;
From either end the3’ spout and rage,
Whilst patient Hansard, page by page,
Records their tommy rot.
O, mummer men in Parliament!
The pieces that ye play
Impressed the bard when he was young ;
But now he’s bald and gray.
“ The Crisis ” and the old “ Stonewall
Development and plot—
Were played in years he’d fain recall.
Their time-worn scenes beg'in to pall
On one who knows them—knows them all
For ancient tommy rot.

It seems now that whisky has been grafted
on to the Maori religion—much in the same way
that the Pagan sprees were grafted on to the
Christian Christmas. A Maori was “up” for
supplying liquor to eight women ; and he pleaded
Maori custom. A flattened magistrate remarked
~” , ,
that, in that case, it must be a pretty modern
custom. Then the accused explained. Reretini
TT •, jlilj
Uru was sick, and her husband sent for a
tohunga to get rid of the tormenting devil. The
tohunga used to take the patient to sacred ground ;
now, however the patient takes a drop of whisky
instead, and thinks she son sacred ground. More-
over to help along the i lusion all the friends and
neighbors take a drop of whisky ; wherefore the
newplan of devil-dispersing is becoming immensely
popular, and is sworn to as being far more
efficacious than the old one. The magistrate, who
is always taught to walk very ginger y when
Maori custom is mentioned, didn t quite know
what he ought to do under the circumstances, and
hung the matter up till the Maori Council should
have time to say a few words about it.
The widespread British royal family comes
in for another throne. Prince Charles of Den-
mark and his wife Maud, daughter of Edward
VII., become King and Queen of Norway at a
small salary, and Charles takes the blood-curdling
title of King Hakon ~S/ 11. The name recalls a lot
of quaint old history. The first Hakon came to the
Norwegian throne when the people drove out King
Eric Blanky-Axe (they were a primitive race and
used a worse term than “blanky ”), son of Harold
Fairhair. Hakon I. was troubled all his days by the
sons of Eric Blanky-Axe, and left few results
behind him. Hakon 11. had to fight for his king-
dom with Harold Greyfell, allegedly a grand-
nephew of Harold Bluetooth: and Hakon 111.
had to scramble with Inge 1., Eystein 111. and
Magnus Y.—mostly alleged descendants of Mag-
nus Barefoot who was killed in Ireland—all trying
to reign at once on a far from commodious throne.
The later Hakons were of comparatively small
account, and lived in reasonably peaceful times.
They weren’t harassed by the insurrectionary
descendants of Olaf Tryggvasson and Harold
Bluetooth and Eric Blanky-Axe as were earlier
Hakons, and at last even the posterity of Sigma
Jorsalafari and Erling Skakke and Gorm the
Old and Snorro Bad-Egg and Knut Dogfight
and such-like persons ceased from breaking
the peace. Under these circumstances the
new royalties may have a quiet time, disturbed
only by the smallness of the salary and the
impossibility of persuading Henrik Ibsen to get
his hair cut.

The time of the Yic. Police Commission is
in some cases wasted by the introduction of
evidence which seems deliberately intended to
cover the inquiry with ridicule. The other day a
witness came along with the assertion that he had
often “squared” the police whilst he was engaged
in running a “racecourse game.” Then he stated
with an air of virtuous indignation that the
“ squared ” policemen had proved false to him on
many occasions byconfiscatingliisprecious “game”
after taking his money. The evidence was naturally
supposed to relate to fairly modern transactions,
but when the witness was asked for dates he ad-
mitted that he had been talking of what happened
40 years ago. How came it that this spieler of
auld lang syne was summoned to give evi-
dence, or permitted to appear with evidence, that
could merely raise a laugh against the Commis-
sion ? Surely it is somebody’s business to see that
a would-be witness has something of possible
importance to tell before he is called upon to open
his mouth.

“Please, Mr. Bones,” she said, “this is the meat

Just at what point does the undertaking
ghoul draw the line in the matter of advertise-
ment ? At the moment when the widow or the
mother is least able to take care of herself, the
harpy comes at her and her little, purse,
with the yarn that to “do the thing
well ” is only what love demands;
and the mourner’s grief is
paraded through the city
streets, so that the crowd may
see that Ghoul and Co.’s
business is flourishing, and
the firm's horses are black,
and its hearse has a tine
polish on it. Even when
the streets are only
tolerably full the busi-
ness is an indecent
scandal; but not long
ago, when a big pro-
cession had brought
tens of thousands
into the city, and
ordinary traffic was
suspended in many
places, along the
route came Ghoul
and Co.’s closed
hearse, with the
name-plate well
polished, followed
by a mourning
coach with no-
body in it; and,
though the dri-
vers had their
weepers on, and
were going at the
regulation funeral
crawl, it’s very
doubtful if any-
body was in the
hearse either. It
looked 10 to 1
that the solemn-
looking business
was a scandalous
farce played as
an advertisement
for Ghoul and Co.
Why don’t the
municipalities
take up the under-
taking work, and
do it decently and at half the present cost ?

Mr. Fleming, who describes himself as
an anarchist, gave evidence before the Police
Commission in Melbourne the other day. He
said he was against all forms of authority, parti-
cularly that kind which makes a visible and out-
ward demonstration in the person of the police-
man. “ I don’t believe in no police,” said Mr.
Fleming, and the Commission began to be awake
for the first time in many dreary days. “What
would you substitute instead of the police force,
Mr. Fleming?” ingratiatingly asked the chair-
man. “Nothin’ —nothin’,” said the witness.
“All forms of authority is frauds.” And he was
at least partly right. Some forms of authority
are land frauds, and among the rest are military
frauds, hairy frauds who lurk behind the ambush
of their whiskers, genial frauds who pass off their
stomachs as evidence of good humor, pious frauds,
Holy Joes, and sundries.

Now the dog-star rages —as the old poets
used to put it—and the westerly wind and the
bush fire set thermometers at the century, and
the demand for lemon squash grows. A popular
squash shop, these days, pays dividends like a
gold-mine. But very, very few shops, sell a
genuine squash in Sydney. Within a radius
of 20 miles of the city there are millions of
lemons rotting on the trees because it doesn’t pay
to market them, whilst the popular squash is
made of an imported chemical stuff. The Board
of Health should sternly suppress the chemical
squash, which is a robbery and an injury to the
Eublic stomach as well as to the orchardist. An
onest squash gives the retailer, at the general
price of lemons, a full twopence profit out of the
threepence charged. The chemical squash pro-
bably gives 2£d. profit, or it would not be so
extensively retailed. The seller who isn’t satis-
fied with a 66 per cent, profit, but adulterates to
make it 80 per cent., deserves no sympathy.

Each year since the S’African war the officers
of the cohentingents have held a dinner in Mel-
bourne, and swapped lies, and told one another
what brave fellows they were, and in some cases got
valiantly and fearfully tight. This year the thing
was got under way as usual, but there is a slump
in that kind of patriotism, and the feast fizzled
horribly. None of the gilt-edged gentry turned
up. Many of the officahs themselves failed to
rally round the bottle and the flag, and 30
patriots, some of whom the pop of a cork would
raise from their graves, were all who answered
the call. They fed in solemn state, surrounded
by several acres of empty tables and a jungle of
deserted chairs.

At the Liverpool (N.S.W.) Tubercle Farm
not only does the Government keep pauper con-
sumptives in a factory building, where they are
stored like sardines, and are, on the average,
killed within two years, but it supplies a noxious
sewer in the near vicinity to make more miserable
the lives of the unhappy inmates. According to
the medical superintendent—
The state of the river adjoining the institution has a
prejudicial effect on the health of the inmates, the mal
odor having proved in many instances a contributing
cause in hastening the end of the dying.

S.A. Coroner Ramsay Smith, of Tommy
Walker fame, is consistently falling foul of legal
opinion in his capacity of coroner. At the inquest
on the body of Isabella Wortley, shot by the
jockey Howie, at Glenelg (S.A.), the jury found
that the woman came to her death by a gunshot
wound inflicted by Howie. Ramsay Smith
directed the clerk to make out the verdict in the
form that Howie “ did wilfully, feloniously, and
with malice aforethought kill and murder,” &c.
H. W. Yarley, who was watching proceedings on
behalf of Howie, contended that this was not the
jury’s finding, but the coroner’s. Then Coroner
Smith rose like an infuriated tall building with
the Wrath of God on top of it, and announced, in
a loud voice, that the jury would sign the docu-
ment or stay there till it did, and the lawyer said
that, even though Coroner Smith stood up and
shouted till the Public Debt was paid off, the jury
wouldn’t. Finally a compromise was arrived, at,
and Dr. Smith took home his injured dignity in a
truck.

Alderman Wells (Adelaide), in proposing a
motion of sympathy with the Russian Jews, hoped
that steps would be taken to draw the attention
of fugitive Israelites to the attractions of Aus-
tralia. But no one encouraged him much. There
was a general feeling that if 40,000 new pawn-
brokers struck this country the business would be
overdone.

Westralian Full Court struck two solici-
tor’s names off the roll the other day, and re-
marked that it was going to be vigorous in the
matter if the Westralian Gent One in general
didn’t get into better habits. “It was time,”
said Justice Burnside, “ that cognisance was
taken by the Bench of the condition into which
the roll was fast getting. The profession was a
high and honorable one, and it was time the
source from which the Bench was drawn was puri-
fied.” Matters must be pretty bad with the six-
and-eightpenny trade-union when a Judge talks
like that.

The northern coal area of N.S.W. is re-
markable for its un-Australian names. On the
map it looks like a piece of the North of England,
Northumberland for preference. It has Mor-
peth, Hexham, Hepburn, Stanford-Merthyr,
Plattsburg, Wallsend, and so on. Some of the
spots had Australian or semi-Australian names at
the outset, but, as coal showed itself, coaly English
names were borrowed and affixed. Newcastle was
originally Kingston, after Governor King.

About the eccentricities of Fitz Gibbon’s
Board: —
The state of muddlement that Melbourne’s Board of
Works has drifted into promises to cause some lively
trouble between autocrat FitzCJibbon and boss Bent, now
that ex-Mayor Pleasance and the municipal crowd have
formally charged Fitz and co. with incompetence.
If Bent is going' to pose as a practical business man
in this matter he will have no difficulty in scoring' oi.e
point, on the question of water-rating, apart from all
questions concerning the belated and needlessly costly
sewering of Melbourne and suburbs. The average
suburban householder under Board of Works bye-laws is
taxed eithei too much or too little. If the house has any-
thing of a garden, and the garden is sufficiently watered
to keep any sort of vegetation alive through the summer,
the Board compels the owner to have a water meter fixed.
And a meter means an increase in the annual payment for
water consumption, No matter how small the family
may be, or how modest the expenditure of water for
garden purposes, the quantity registered by a meter is
always greater than the quantity permitted by the ordi-
nary rate. Therefore the watering of even a small garden
incidental to a small house js„a luxury which must be
paid for.
But if a comparatively large house doesn’t keep a
garden going the meter is not compulsory. The whole
household expenditure of water is supposed to be fully
covered by the water-rate without regard to the fact that
the house may have a dozen boarders, each of whom
takes a daily plunge bath. Consequently the tidy lone
widow who grows a few lettuces and geraniums and
things is more heavily taxed than the lively widow who
converts her garden into a howling wilderness and takes
in a number of nice clean gentleman boarders for a living.
Fitz Gibbon’s Board at the outset of its career thought to
give the small amateur gardeners a chance of fair play by
permitting them to pay a garden rate of 10s. a year
which would entitle them to nourish their geraniums
without getting a water-meter ; but the Board’s notion
of a small garden was so ridiculously small that the Ids.
rate doesn’t apply in thousands of cases where it ought
to. There isn’t room for a kitten to overtake its own
tail in what the Board calls a small garden.
The Board has lost a considerable income, and subur-
ban Melbourne has turned many little garden-plots into
deserts as the result of an ill-considered bye-law, or an
absurd miscalculation of the quantity of water which a
householder is entitled to consume without exceeding
the amount of the water-rate.
If every house containing eight rooms, or more, were
charged for its water through a meter, as it is charged
for its gas ; if every large garden, regardless of the size
of the house, were likewise compelled to have a meter ;
if the small house with a little piece of garden were
bound to carry the ten “bob” garden-rate—then the
existing anomaly would be abolished.

“Homo”: Re doctors and stethoscopes
(B. 12/10/’O5), “the old wooden double-ended
arrangement” hasn’t altogether “dropped out of
doctordom.” As an instance of the weapon’s
thorough reliability, even under adverse condi-
tions, I know a doctor of considerable repute, who
went on day by day diagnosing aneurisms, cardiac
affections, tubercular and pleuritic patches, etc.,
per medium of a wooden stethoscope, which had
been tightly plugged up by a waggish brother-
medico. The victim of the joke had defective
eyesight, and worked his gun thus for three solid
months without discovering that it had been
spiked.
VIRTUE HAS ITS OWN REWARD.

A Melbourne woman who is seeking two
divorces at once evidently understands that busi-
ness principle which consists in getting a reduction
on taking a quantity. She puts the case thus :
She first married Walker, who disappeared almost
immediately. She heard he was dead, but he
wasn’t—he had only gone away. On the strength
of Walker’s reported death she married Brown,
who was apparently a failure, and threw her out,
and almost immediately afterwards married
Amelia Clapp. The petitioner desires to be
divorced from Walker on account of his alleged
desertion, and from Brown on account of his
alleged misconduct, though if the court can’t give
her a divorce from Brown, a decision that there
was never any legal marriage will do as well.
This sort of thing arouses a sort of sympathy for
that shadowy background figure, Amelia Clapp,
whom nobody seems to consider. If the court
gives the petitioner a divorce from Brown, then it
decides that there was a marriage with Brown,
and in that case where does Amelia Clapp come
in ? On the other hand, if it decides that there
was no marriage, then Amelia Clapp gets Brown
sure enough, but it would take a more extended
knowledge of Brown than this paper possesses to
decide whether Amelia Clapp should be congratu-
lated or not.
“ Huffin-Guffin ” : Yes, Melbourne is a
remarkable place for shaking things (B. 26/10/’OS).
We lately moved there from an honest country
town. The wife hung her pet canary out on the
front verandah the first day we dug him out from
the ruins of what Bent’s railways had left of our
furniture, and also laid the door-mat at the front
door. By-and-by, along came a benevolent-looking
elderly gentleman, with nice whiskers, who said
“Madam,” and touched his hat frequently. He
explained the utter recklessness of our action in
thus leaving our property about. “Several ladies
in this street, madam, have lost their . birds,
madam, and door-mats, madam, only the last few
days, madam.” We thanked him profusely, and
took the articles in. That night, our well-filled
woodshed was left almost bare. The few remains
of firewood looked as though they had been left
us out of kindness by a benevolent-looking old
gentleman with nice whiskers and a habit of say-
ing “Madam” frequently, who had taken stock
of things while talking about a canary.

A person named Bell has been lecturing
in Brisbane on the virtues of our dear friend and
ally, the Jap. He also writes a good deal of
slush to the Brisbane Daily Mail like this : “ To
secure for the civilised world the open door to the
numberless hearts and homes of half Asia, more
than a million Japanese were hurriedly transferred
from the productive to the destructive force of
Japan, and this diversion of energy . . . hassown
a portion of this beautiful country with want and
human suffering. Not from her faults, but from
her almost excessive virtues have arisen Japan’s
tribulations.” This cracked Bell goes on : “Aus-
tralians are bountifully supplied with the things
for which these people long,” and urges that we
should send “consignments of food products.”
Not only would it be a “gracious act,” but we
ought to do so, for the Jap is pledged to defend
us when assailed, and he is going to be our best
customer in the future, and he is also going to be
our leader. It has come already—the Jap is to
be our leader and protector. It is nothing that
the unemployed are wandering hopelessly about
the streets of every Australian city ; it does not
matter that there are a million people in England
at the present moment who have not a crust and
are absolutely dependent on benevolent; relief to
save them from starvation —we ought to send con-
signments to Japan. Why can’t Japan float a
loan, and buy rice for the hungry people with the
money ? If it borrowed enough to raise its debt
per head to even one-tenth of the Australian figure
it would have enough money to carry everybody
over till next harvest.
As the absorption of Camperdown by the
Sydney Munic.pal Council, thus' beginning the
formation of a Greater Sydney, approaches, the
yelling of the landed interests in that locality grows
louder. the soil on which Cafnperdown now
stands was among the first grants allotted on the
nod by the early rulers of Botany Bay. In 1793
Lieutenant-Governor Grose handed out. as
he states in a letter to England, “ one
hundred acres to such officers as asked.”
But he didn’t confine himself to officers, as the
official returns show the names of several convicts
and free settlers. Among those, figuring on the
return are John Harris. George Johnston, Rev.
Richard Johnson, John Macarth'ur, John Palmer,
and Edward Powell. Most of the land between
Sydney and Parramatta was thus given away
without one penny of consideration. Grose not
alone gave away the lands, but allowed each officer
ten convicts for cultivation purposes and victualled
them from the public stores.

The Anglican Synod, at Melbourne assem-
bled, has resolved to give Bishop Clarke power to

be strictly confined to church properties :—
A NEW IDEA.
DOMAIN PARTY : “ Beg parding, sir, but do you
’appen to have lost yer purse ?”
GENT (having felt his pocket): “ No, my man,
no.”
DOMAIN PARTY : “ Well, then, guv'nor (hie), you
can let me 'ave (hie) a little assistance.”
A lively tangle has arisen over three
ramshackle Sydney wharves. When the plague
scare was on, Parliament (on behalf of the people)
resumed these wharfs, which had been (on behalf
of the people) vested in the City Council.
Whereupon the Council (on behalf of the people)
demanded from the Government £48,000 compen-
sation, and the amount was paid into the Equity
Court (on behalf the people). Now the Harbor
Trust(on behalf of thepeople)demandsthe wharves.
So the Council can’t get its £48,000 which it wants
to spend on the city streets. The Law Department
has advised that the compensation money can, by
law, only be used for constructing new wharves,
and as the City Council is out of the wharf
business, it won’t get the money. Yet the Harbor
Trust can’t get possession of the wharves, and
the Government can’t get anything. So an
amending Bill is to be passed to alter this disas-
trous state of affairs, and to allow the Government
to spend its own money. All the trouble has
arisen from the way the Government has of
compensating itself for transferring its money
from one pocket in its pants to the other pocket
in the same pants.

The recent protracted Federal debates
have played havoc with the Plansard men. The
all-night sittings of the Australian Parliament
left the staff—always short-handed through the
ridiculous system of wasting one man in taking a
check note —limp as wet rags. An appeal was
made to the State Hansard for assistance, which
was like sending West for water at drought time.
Last recess one of the Yic. Hansard staff died,
and, instead of filling his place, the Bent Ministry
committed the meanness of making a sessional
appointment, which means that a man was given
the job for the term of the session, and was denied
the holiday that Hansard men really want during
recess after the ordeal of six months’ hard note-
taking. Half-way through the session one of the
regular men broke down from overwork, and, a
little later, the sessional man, Joe Melvin, wanted
to throw up the job. He was prevailed on to stay,
and a pressman from the Herald was taken on
to fill the vacancy, but he had enough after a
week. Vic. Hansard, which was asked to come
forward and assist the Federal staff, is itself
working one man short, and can't do justice to
the remarks of Enabling, M.L.C., about the
necessity of being kind to people who adulterate
food.

A unique prosecution is under way, in
Melbourne, against a young woman for “falsely,
wickedly, and unlawfully soliciting and inciting”
another woman to prevent the appearance of the
usual baby, “contrary to the peace of our Lord
the King.” It seems to be playing it rather low
down on Edward VII to drag him—with a family,
too —into these delicate matters.
“Drifter”: The mild-mannered Merely
Mary Ann at times furnishes a sensation. My
friend Bronson and his wife have had some
queer experiences. On one occasion the
actions of Merely struck Mrs. B. with a
sense of the peculiar which was aggravated
by hearing murmuring and strange
noises from Mary Ann’s bedroom.
One afternoon she heard a succession
of sounds while the maid was down
in the kitchen, and went in to in-
vestigate. Under the bed was a
L strange girl in the midst of an
' onslaught on a plateful of din-
ner. Mary Ann naively ex-
plained that she was sticking
to her mate until she got a billet,
and that she had only been hiding
there for one week. Soon after-
wards they got another girl. It
was at the period when the comet
was observable, some time in the
small hours. Bronson came home
with the news, and his wife, who
was curious to see a star with a
tail, begged of him to rouse her up to
witness the wonder. The new
Merely Sarah Jane also became
curious, and pleaded for a knock
at her door when the phenomenon
was on. When Bronson knocked,
a voice, startled into sudden in-
discretion, yelled, “ What’s up? ”
Bronson almost fell through the
door with astonishment. It was
a man’s voice ! Some time after
the individual had made his un-
dignified exit through the window
and was speeding away
beneath the fatal comet,
Sarah Jane tearfully ex-
plained that her husband
had been unfortunate, and
was in a jobless condi-
tion, and she did not
think she had done any
harm. Then Bronson nego-
tiated for a simple country
girl. Her plain simple
narrative was afterwards
related in the police court,
and beyond the fact that
she invented a new kind of
hysterics in the clock she was of
no great interest.
Is the N.S.W. Parliament going to take
any steps regarding the very confused and
foolish Judge Rogers who, having a certain work-
man before him in the dock, harangued dis-
jointedly about the alleged fashion in which the
Federal law kept out desirable persons like the
accused (who had evidently not been kept out),
and said that the accused was just the sort of man
we wanted here, and then gave him six months
hard labor? According to the foolish jeer which
Mr. Rogers threw at this country, the sort of man
badly wanted here is the kind that gets six
months. There was no question of immigration
laws involved in the case, which was simply one
of aiding and abetting a felony, so it was a gratuit-
ous insult dragged in without point or sense or
relevance or any o her excuse whatever, and it is
up to Mr. Rogers to explain.
A FIGURE OF SPEECH.
“ Clarice, what is the grod of my buying you a
bicycle t You seem to use it less now than
when you hadn't it."
N.S.W. has laid in its first “habitual
criminal ”as specified under the new Act. He
was detected stealing something small from a
Chinaman. The sentence of three years just
passed brings up his total to 25 years, so he seems
quite habitual enough for all ordinary purposes.
He is now liable to perpetual incarceration unless
he puts up a record of unobtrusive good behavior
for two consecutive years, and doesn’t steal the
cell door or the lead off the gaol roof.

Dawn lit a lantern pink
In the sky—
The birth-light of the Morn
Drawing nigh,
And the eucalyptus trees
Swung their incense on the breeze
As we rode across the leas,

NOON.
Oh, Life and Love ran hot
Through our veins,
We put no check on Life’s
Bridle reins,
And a crimson burning ray
From the golden heart of day
Shed a shimmer on our way—
Love o’ mine.
EVE.

One by one
Pursue the flaming footsteps
Of the sun,
And they leave me here alone
By thy monument of stone
When the light of Life has flown—

THE BUD.
The church, though claiming for itself
The care of Heaven, is not content,
And takes precautions ’cute, its pelf
To save in case of accident;
And so a fund it much desires
To pay for churches lost by fires.
But only for church property
Is this wise plan to be matured.
The cautious parsons clearly see,
If called to pay for souls insured
From fire, their precious fund would go
Insolvent in a week or so !


The WILD CAT
COLUMN
N.S.W. Treasurer Carruthers last week intro-
duced a Treasury Bills Deficiency Bill, which ex-
Treasurer tYitddell welcomed as “ reasonable, and a good
way to get rid of an ugly disfigurement on our accounts.”
N.S.W. has a large floating debt, representing the accu-
mulated delicts ot the past that haven’t been provided
for in a definite way—money in excess of revenue that
has been grabbed from wherever the Treasurers could get
it. Now the Premier proposes to borrow money on
Treasury bills to provide for th s floating accumulated
deficit, and to increase the public debt though the
amount so added won’t be represented by anything what-
ever in the shape of works ; and the ex-Treasurer cor-
dially approves of the proposal as “ a good way to get rid
of an ugly disfigurement ” ! Treasurer Carruthers sweeps
the refuse under the bed ; and ex-Treasurer Waddell says
it has been satisfactorily got rid of.
On June 30 the accumulated deficits amounted
to £2,064,515', of which £1,727,627 was represented by
"Treasury bills, and the balance of £336,890 was floating
debt. Apparently the Government proposes to issue
Treasury bills for this latter amount, and provide for re-
payment at the rate of £50,000 a year, so that even if
there isn’t any other deficit meantime it will be seven
years before this new deficiency is wiped out. Down to
1885, when the borrowing mania had just become acute
(in 1880 the debt was £14,903,919, and by 1886 it had
sprung to £41,034,249), the State had managed to pay its
way and avoid accumulated deficits. In fact, up to that
year there was an accumulated surplus. But as soon as
the policy of borrowing to develop the great natural
resources began in earnest, and Cohen began to
look in for his interest, New South Wales started
to pile up an “accumulated deficiency.” At first,
down to the end of 1889, the accumulated deficit was re-
garded as a merely temporary thing ; all that was wanted
was a year or two for the permanent and reproductive
works to develop the magnificent natural resources, and
then it would be wiped out for good. By the end of 1889,
However, as the permanent and reproductive works or
the great natural resources, or something, didn’t pan-
out up to expectations, the first Treasury bills were
issued—the first definite acknowledgment of the failure
of the great loan policy. From that time to this the
accumulated deficit has never been got rid of. Taxation
has been increased enormously ; but—mainly because
foreign borrowing has also been increased enormously,
and the money has been sunk in undertakings which
don’t pay their way, so that the unearned interest has
had to come out of taxation—revenue has never
got far enough ahead of expenditure to wipe
the deficit out. And Treasurer Carruthers (with
the cordial approval of ex-Treasurer Waddell) now
proposes to sweep tile new deficiency under the bed, and
hide it behind another pile of Treasury bills, with the
deliberate intention of keeping some of it there for seven
years at least.
When J. H. Carruthers wants to show what a
successful and prudent Treasurer he is, he points to the
fact that he is now paying off £350,000 of the public debt
per annum. After this Treasury Bills Bill is passed, he
will, no doubt, throw out his chest further than ever and
remark that he is paying off the public debt at the rate
of £400,000 a year ; and the fact that £400,000 a year
is being paid off will be put forward as an excel-
lent reason why Bull Cohen should be tapped for
£4,000,000. But the fact is that the real public debt is
hardly touched ; £300,000 a year of the repayment goes
to wipe out the Treasury Bills issued to cover' up deficits
—to “get rid of ugly disfigurements,” as Waddell put it.
And even this is a farce. In a good year the repayment
is made ; but in a moderate or bad year the repayment is
counterbalanced by a deficit. Treasurers have for 20
years past been crowing, just as Carruthers does, that
they have paid off large amounts of back debt ; yet the
fact remains that the accumulated deficit was just the
same size on June 30th last as it was in 1890. Absolutely
no progress had been made in the intervening 15
years. If there was a legitimate repayment in a
fat year, there, was a corresponding deficit in the
next lean year. In other words, in the past 15 years the
State.has not only made no progress in paying off any of
its real debt, but it has actually not reduced its accumu-
lated deficit. The money contributed from first to last
for redemptions out of revenue amounts to £277,000.
That is the sum total of the real sinking fund of N.S.
Wales. All the other payments have been mere contri-
butions towards wiping out deficits —and, as pointed out
above, there hasn’t been any net contribution even on
that account duVing the past 15 years. Meantime, in
these 15 years, something like £18,000,000 of land-sale
money has been approppriated as revenue, and £32,000,000
has been borrowed. It is a ghastly record.
Treasurer Carruthers, announcing his Treasury
Bills Bill, stated-that, if he didn’t have to pay more than
£50,000 this year towards wiping out the new deficiency,
he would be able to pay for the Public Library buildings
and probably something else out of revenue. All of which
will no doubt be counted to Joseph for righteousness. It
is only ordinary honesty that non-productive works like
the Public Library should be paid for out of revenue.
But it isn’t Joseph’s fault that even ordinary honesty is
being practised in this matter. Joseph, anyhow, d.dn’t
provide for any surplus to be used for this purpose ;
if he gets a surplus the credit for the honesty belongs to
an extra-good wool season mostly. Honesty' shouldn’t
hang upon so uncertain a thread as an Australian season.
When a Treasurer has grit enough to provide in his ordi-
nary estimates for a public works policy, and to arrange
his taxation accordingly, something like the beginning of
a reform will begin. Then if an extra-good season happens
along, and there is a surplus, it needn’t provoke anybody
to become excited, for going on the records of the past 15
years, the surplus will soon be wiped out.
South Australia has won. Hitherto it has
prided itself on the invention of the wheat-stripping
machine, the Real Property Act, and the stump-jumping
ploug-h ; but these are small things now that it will be
able to claim to have, in proportion to population, the
Biggest Debt on Earth. Queensland for years held the
title ; but Queensland woke, and saw where it was going,
and stopped, while S. Australia has plugged steadily on.
On June 30 last the position was as follows :
S. Australia £7B 1 1 per head
Queensland 80 1 11 ~
But whereas Queensland has sworn off further borrowing
(thoug-h the swearing off isn’t even yet as definite as
could be desired), S. Australia has just passed loan esti-
mates amounting to £362,209. These figures compare
with those showing actual loan expenditure for the pre-
vious two years in this way :
1903- £581,169
1904- 624,069
1905- 832,209
So the further S. Australia goes the worse it gets. In-
cluding the £862,209 now authorised, the debt-position of
the two States is approximately as follows :
S. Australia £BO 7 1 per head
Queensland 80 111 ~
Queensland will probably spend a few thousands of loan
money during the year, but practically the whole of it
will be locked-up loan money repaid by the Q.N. Bank ;
nothing in the way of new borrowing is proposed. And
as the population of Queensland (especially the adult male
population) is increasing much more rapidly than that of
S. Australia, the latter State has made its position secure
—on a population basis it has achieved the Greatest Debt
on Earth.
The only thing that can be said by way of
excuse for Labor-Premier Price is that some of the works
which will absorb the £562,209 were authorised by the
Parliament led by ex-Premier Butler, and several of them
were begun before Price arrived. But Price adds numer-
ous heavy lines to the bill. For “ railway accommoda-
tion,” for example, £75,000 is on the Estimates. Some of
this has been spent already on relaying' certain lines—
practically on repairs. The old worn-out lines, paid for
out of loans, are not capable of carrying the traffic,
and on that plea they are being relaid and the
cost charged to more loans ; so that the one
line will be pasted over with two I 0 U’s and
one lot of traffic will have to carry two lots of Cohen.
Another £155,000 is down for harbor improvements ; and,
though Premier Price’s Labor platform is against borrow-
ing except for undertakings that can show interest and
sinking fund, there doesn’t seem to be the smallest likeli-
hood of much of the harbor work filling that bill. Cer-
tainly, here again it has to be said that Price found the
biggest work—the Outer Harbor —under way when he
arrived.
Another £200,000 is provided for land repur-
chase for closer settlement. If he were asked why he
didn’t make land available for settlement by taxing' it into
use, Premier Price would no doubt reply that the Legisla-
tive Council will not let him. Question, however, is
whether Price and his party made a serious enough
attempt to rouse the State on this loan question ; whether
the awfulness of the drift has been sufficiently hammered
into the people ; whether they have been told that only
one State in all the world had more deeply pawned its
possessions, arid only one State was humping a heavier
load of interest. If they haven’t been told that with
sufficient emphasis, Price has now the chance to tell them
that even that one State has now been passed, and South
Australia has pawned itself more deeply than any other
country in all the world.

Ex-Governor Jersey tells Australia that it
shouldn’t borrow any more—yet awhile, anyhow—ex-
cept for irrigation works. The reason for making an ex-
ception of irrigation works isn’t visible on the surface.
Also it isn’t easy to find a reason even if you dig for it.
So far from irrigation works having proved reproductive
in Australia, they have in almost every case been financi-
ally disastrous. Exclusive of national works, those handed
over to Victorian irrigation trusts have cost £1,120,650.
From this £724,776 of capital has been written off (the
trusts declaring that it was utterly impossible for them
to pay interest on the mon v) besides £337,23 > of interest.
The waterworks are capable of irrigating 2,373, ISO acres,
exclusive of roads and reserves; the area actually irri-
gated is only 157,523 acres. That is to say, there are
enough works already carried out and paid for by the
State in Victoria to irrigate about 16 times the area now
under irrigation. The land is of almost all classes and
situated in every part of the State ; a great deal of it is
much handier to markets than any land available for
irrigation in N.S.W. is ; and yet so almost utter a failure
has irrigation been that not l-16th of the irrigable area is
now watered ; and the State has had to relieve the
irrigationists of two-thirds of the capital cost, and forgive
them most of the interest they should have paid. There
is mighty little encouragement in these circumstances to
make an exception in favor of borrowing for irrigation.
It looks, instead, about the last thing for which a State,
resolved only to borrow for permanent and reproductive
undertaking's, should go to Cohen.

Under the reasonably effective State tariff of
Queensland the engineering trade up there was making
steady progress, and the work was improving until it had
almost driven foreign machines off the goldfields at
any rate. In the last three years during which the effects
of the State tariff were felt the number of men employed
in Queensland as engineers and ironfounders was as fol-
lows :
1899 .. .. .. .. 2073
1900 .. ■ .. .. .. 2233
1901 .. .. .. .. 2308
But about this time the Queensland Federal Labor party
decided in effect that it didn’t matter whether Queens-
land ironfounders, &c., were employed or not, whereupon
it “ sank the fiscal issue ” ; and the State returned one or
two avowed Freetraders besides. Then this happened
(engineers and ironfounders employed in subsequent
years):—■
1901 .. 2308 I 1903 .. 1204
1902 .. 1888 | 1904 .. 1037
In other words, more than one-half of the engineers and
ironfounders who were employed in 1901, when the effects
of the Queensland State tariff were still felt, have since
been dismissed ; and the employment of the remainder is
irregular and precarious. Does the Queensland Labor
party, or any other party, really say that those 1271
Queensland engineers who have lost their work don’t
matter ?

Once more —Australia needs a Protective
tariff. During the past twelve months one Australian
lead-smelting works has been shut down, and now the
Australian lead-rolling- industry finds a lively competitor
issuing from Canada. The much-boomed land-of-the-
snows is placing sheet-lead on the'Australian market, and
its bounty-fed manufacturers find they can at times
undersell in Australia the local producers. Given a few
more years of tariff inanition, and Australia will be so
helpless that it will send its old pants abroad for some
foreign girl to stitch a button on.
The Bulletin, looking at fire and accident
insurance figures, has been expecting it ; and it comes
from Queensland —the Queensland Accident and General
Insurance Co., to start in Brisbane (if it can get the
money), and to creep into the other States when it has
found" its legs. Its authorised capital is £lOl,OOO in £1
shares ; promoters propose to issue 50,000 shares for a
start, and to call the thing formed when 20,000 are
applied for. As only ss. per share will be avail-
able at once, co. will probably stand off fire
and marine insurance for a start, and set itself
chiefly to get the business which the new
Queensland Workmen’s Compensation law will create.
The' figures certainly show there is room for it ;
there would be room for a dozen its size if, instead of
feeding foreign co.’s with insurance business, Australians
either gave their business to existing Australian offices
or formed. new offices to do it for them. Apparently,
however, quite a lot of Australians prefer to give their
business to foreign people who make 10 or 15 per cent,
out of them, while they themselves put their money into
fixed deposits at 3 per cent. It’s a strange, perverted
taste..

Advances .. .. 18,969,250 18,942,298 26,952
Compared with the position 12 months ago, deposits have
thus increased £2,226,938, of w'hich considerably more
than half is represented by unproductive coin and bullion,
and another £790,000 is only earning a trifle on short call
in London. Meantime, while deposits (much of them
carrying interest) have expanded so rapdly, advances
have actually shrunk to a small extent. Y’et profits are
£126,983 as compared with £120,435 for the corres-
pond ng half of 1904. The- reduction in the rate
of interest no doubt accounts for a good deal
of this. Probably also there have been less bad debts
to provide for, or less provision has been made.
Besides the reserves shown in the table, the bank has a,
reserve held for doubtful debts ; this, with some other
items, is included with “ bills in circulation, &c.” It will
be noticed that this item shows a substantial decrease,
though there are no means of telling to what section of
the composite item the decrease is due. The liquid
assets arq now equal to 40 per cent, of all liabilities to the
public—a substantially larger proportion than usual. With
perfect safety, it would seem, the bank could put nearly
£2,000,000 more into advances ; it would then have 35
per cent, of the public money liquid. With that money
out, depositors would be able to get the old higher rate
of interest without impairing profits. But the industries
in which the capital ought to be invested are being' car-
ried on with the aid of foreign capital in foreign
countries, and the Australian capital is either lying
unproductive in the bank’s vaults or is in Lon-
don earning a mere trifle. And even when the capital
is out in Australia it is to a very large extent in land-
mortgages, which is not the class of business an energetic
bank in an energetic country would look on with most
favor. Still, the Bank of N.'S. Wales continues to show
very solid earnings for its shareholders, .though the,y pro-
bably wouldn’t object to even larger earnings, and
depositors certainly wouldn’t object to larger interest,
and even the staff might not object if its salary was a
trifle higher. Recent figures showing the return on
shareholders’ funds (capital and reserves) have been :
Mar., 1902 ..£7 010 p.c. Mar., 1904 .. £7 2 10 p.c.
Sept., 1902 .. 7 3 5 „ Sept., 19C4 .. 7 3 0 „
Mar., 1903 .. 619 9 „ Mar., 1905 .. 710 10 „
Sept., 1903 .. 7 011 ~ Sept., 1905 .. 7 8 8,,
Several Australian banks show up higher. But “the
Wales ” doesn’t write down certain of its assets hard at
the expense of its reserve fund ; and, while this means
big figures in the balance-sheet, it tends to reduce the
fig'ures when calculating the proportion of profits on the
basis of reserves and capital.

This co., whose loss rate for some time past has, on the
whole, been much higher than the average of Australian
co.’s, has had a moderate year. A few years ago it
reached out extensively for foreign business, and wound
up with a rather disastrous experience. It was under-
stood to have drawn out of this foreign business almost
entirely ; and in that case the increase of business now
shown, bringing the total nearly up to the level of former
days, is very satisfactory. Assuming that this is Aus-
tralian business, which can be watched a good deal better
than foreign business, the loss rate should now be more
satisfactory. Some further particulars as to the co.’s
progress follow:

The underwriting profit (67 per cent, of premiums) is
still among the smallest in Australia, and allows room for
considerable improvement. As to whether part of this
unfavorable experience is due to claims which have come
in under the expiring foreign treaties, future accounts
will probably give some clue. The co.’s securities consist
almost exclusively of Government stocks (£22,650),
fixed deposits (£43,072), and freeholds (£27,874). On the
average of the investments the return amounts to £3
16s. sa. p.c. —satisfactory considering the unusually liquid
character of the securities. A co. which dealt in mort-
gages might reasonably be expected to show a good deal
higher return ; on the other hand, it would send up the
management costs, and at the best of times that class of
security has its risks. The co. is adding substantially to
its reserves ; the present div. absorbs only 51 per cent, of
profits ; and no policy is better calculated to win the con-
fidence of Australian insurers in Australian insurance
oftices'than this steady strengthening of reserves.

The last four figures show a remarkably rapid recovery—
the wool-man is having a fat time just now. The amount
shown as written off in the past year has resulted from a
re-valuation of reserve-fund investments, and they are
exclusively British and foreign public stocks. So it still
happens, in spite of the Socialistic legislation (which we
don’t seem to hear quite as much of now that they have
a new bogey to play with), that Australian investments
can make good the losses which the British investor
incurs on British, Egyptian, and Indian securities. The
co., which set out, in the first place, to finance pastoralists,
has been left to nurse a vast quantity of pastoral property,
especially in the dry parts; but •in the balance-
sheet the advances and foreclosed and other properties
are not shown separately ; the whole are lumped at
£2,248,185. These, it is stated, have been re-valued, and
ample provision made for depreciation ; in that case, and
if the same sort of provision has been made in connection
with “ sundry debtors, £93,194,” the reserves should now
be what they are represented to be. In addition to the
co.’s capital of £520,000, it has issued £1,900,000 of 4 per
cent, and £lOO,OOO of 3 per cent, debenture stock ; it for-
merly had also a considerable amount in debentures out-
standing, but this item has now been reduced to £7400.
Generally speaking, it has been one of the most successful
of Anglo-Australian finance co.’s ; its debenture stock
interest has been kept paid, and though the co. can’t give
now the 15 and 20 per cent. divs. which it paid in the
“flash” days, yet it managed to come through without
making any tremendous bad debts, it continued to pay
fair divs. with hardly a break, and it hung on to substan-
tial reserves. If the Australian manufacturer had done
half as well lie' would have been called a bloated mono-
polist, and bricks would have been thrown through his
factory windows, even if he had the luck to escape them
himself.

Associated, Kalgoorlie, will shortly be more in
evidence. The rise from 1200 ft. will, by end of the
month, be connected with the winze from the 1000 ft.
and then the Oroya shoot will be properly exploited. At
present the ore from the incline winze has to be hauled
up 300 ft. or 400 ft. by an air winch, then trucked 1300 ft. to
Judd’s shaft. When the connection is made the stone
will be dumped.down to the 1200 ft. level, and trucked to
the shaft only 200 ft. away. Developments in all parts of
the mine are being pushed ahead so as to try to get into
full swing to treat 11,000 tons monthly for 66000 z from
January. This would be a 'great improvement on recent
returns, and should place co. on a good and regular pay-
ing basis. The overhaul of the treatment plant is nearly
finished, and it looks much more compact than before.

is awkwardly situated, being about 100 miles east of
Magnet, the nearest railway station, and there is no tele-
graph communication. As regards the Oroya-Brown Hill,
the famous shoot is gradually but certainly being worked
out, though mine should last till end of next year at
least. There are still possibilities in the Oroya south
block, which is entirely untested to the south, all the
work so far havingbeen done near the Associated boundary.

Princess Royal, Norseman (W.A.), must be in a
bad way. The 1700 short tons treated during October
were only worth 375. 3d. per ton, and, as costs are, say,
555., there must have been a loss of about £l5OO. A mine
can’t keep going at that rate for long. Owing to the bad
provision made for water and the absence of rain, Norse-
man district is in a critical state, and it looks as if all the
mines would shortly have to close.

Great Tower Hill, Leonora (W.A.), a resurrec-
tion of late Whitaker Wright’s Standard Exploration Co.,
has started crushing with the Paddington Consols’ old
40-head mill, which has been shifted. Mine consists of a
very big low-grade formation, from which original owner
treated several thousand tons for an Sdwt. average. Co.
was floated in May, ’O4, with a capital of 1,000,000 shares,
so will have to produce a lot of gold to earn decent divs.;
70,000 shares are held in reserve, and there is an out-
standing assessment of 3d. on the shares issued.

Lancefield (W.A.) has closed down. The first
two levels were free milling, and part of the third, but
then an intrusion of arsenical pyrites arrived. The lode
is very large, ranging between 25ft. and 28ft., and the shoot
has been proved for a length of 1100 ft. Tests of the
refractory ore have been made at the Sons of Gwalia, and
it is found that a fairly good extraction can be made by
roasting. The plant will be remodelled with roasters,
and, till this work is completed some months hence, the
mine will remain silent. W.A. is providing metallurgists
and chemists with lots of problems.
* * ' * »
Golden Pole, Davyhurst (W.A.), continues to
provide excitement. Hooper, consulting engineer of
Boulder Perseverance, expresses the opinion that the
mine is all right, though it can’t be compared with the
big Kalgoorlie mines. Percy Morgans, late manager of
Westralia Mt. Morgans, has also visited the property, but
so far has been silent. There seems little doubt that the
ore reserves were grossly exaggerated both as to quantity
and value, that the profits of the past cannot be main-
tained even by treating sands and slimes, and that the
future was sacrificed to make a brave show. Unless a
large expenditure is put into development, co. must find
itself in Queer-street. During the past five years develop-
ment has been neglected, and, once the battery started,
this became only too apparent.

Shareholders in Victory United, Cuddingwarra
(W.A.), get, in a report just issued, confirmation of most of
the things said in Tiie Bulletin about this comic-opera
mine, though naturally nothing is mentioned therein
concerning the tricks the Adelaide crowd has played with
the scrip. New manager Merry, who took charge in
April, found the whole plant an absurdity and the mine
bare of ore except, say, 800 tons. The battery was shaky,
and, though patched up, cannot now do more than about
one ton per stamp in 24 hours ; the cyanide vats were in
a bad way ; even the poppet-legs wobbled. Some develop-
ment has been done since and a quantity of new
machinery got in (and over that, by the way, a law-
suit is pending, co. being the defendants), but nothing
in the shape of cheap work is possible ; and, though
manager Merry still has qualified hopes, the mine is, so
far as can be judged, a perfectly hopeless proposition.
Reef is narrow, irregular, and in value erratic —just the
thing to hang a gamble on, but no good for dividends, or
at any rate not good enough to cover the risks. Present
profit and loss debit balance is £11,427, of which £1645
has been added in the past six months. Co. has about
£lOOO in hand to play with, and this will certainly not be
enough to put the mine ship-shape, so calls are looming
ahead. But only £4OOO (Is. per share) is outstanding;
when that has been mopped up, the worst will probably
happen.

Queensland Silver Lead Mines, Ltd., has secured
its amendment of the Albert River, Burketown and Lily-
dale Tramway Act of 1900. Co. originally put up £2500
as an evidence that it meant business, and was granted an
Act on the lines of the Chillagoe Bill. It undertook to
construct about 120 miles of tramway before the
end of this year, and up to the present it has not
laid a sleeper. Five years have gone ; nothing done.
Co. now puts up a further £2500, and is granted by
Queensland Legislature an extension of two years. If
construction does not begin before l/7/’O6 and is not com-
pleted by l/l/’OB, the £5OOO shall be forfeited.
The Lilydale-Burketown proposition is more
generally known as the Lawn Hill Tramway. The area
of mineral lease nursed by the promoting co. is
vast ; it is the pick of 25 miles by six; it looks
like a grab, but on account of its remoteness
the grab has yet to demonstrate its worth. From
a miner’s point of view the scheme is probably not
such a wild-cat as much of the data circulated by the
promoters would suggest. What money has been spent
in development has been spread over too great an area,
and the result is of little value. Co. has exhausted its
resources in acquiring and scratching Tunnel Hill, Bell’s
Lode, Lawn Hill (or Mended Hill), Watson’s (Big Blow), Lily-
dale, East Star, Silver King, Anglo-American, and Greater
Britain. In this lot are comprised 31 leases. The Silver
King, which is regarded as the most valuable of the lot, is
represented as a specially good mine, because it sent 7J
tons of ore assaying 76 per cent, lead and 430 z. silver to the
smelter. Similarly the Lilydale furnished 37£ tons assaying
81 per cent, lead and silver, and the Mended Hill five
tons assaying 80 per cent, lead and 40oz. silver. To the
uninitiated, this reads well ; but the investor, who will
have to provide about half-a-million of solid cash, re-
quires to know, not what has been sent away from the
mines, but what is left in them. A few tons of . almost
pure galena can be obtained from dozens of lead
shows more readily accessible than Lawn Hill or
Lilydale, and to suppose that those properties are
going to yield more than the average quantity of pure
galena is wasting good time. There is little doubt that
the field has possibilities ; it also has limitations ; but
neither can be definitely assessed at present. Ex-Vic-
torian Geologist Reginald Murray and Queensland
Assistant Government-Geologist Cameron have reported
favorably upon the possibilities, but what is lacking is an
estimate of the tonnage of ore available, and the metallic
contents of same.
It is not altogether necessary to turn to Chilla-
goe to decide the fatuity of spending hundreds of thou-
sands of pounds upon a railway before the mineral traffic
is reasonably assured. Chillagoe as a railway proposition
had good prospective merits ; it is only now beginning to
demonstrate them. The Burketown-Lilydale line has no
immediate proved merits. When the line is constructed,
it will, moreover, still be without a port. It is well known
to those who have investigated the matter that the Gulf
of Carpentaria is not much more capable of cheap ship-
ping facilities than is Bourke, in N.S. W. For that reason
the Normanton-Cloncurry people dropped their railway
scheme, and suggested that the Government allow
them to connect Cloncurry with Richmond instead.
Although -it took them several years to realise
it, they found it essential to come east for
a port. Queensland Silver Lead Mines will recog-
nise that sad circumstance presently. Present coastal
steamers are compelled to anchor five miles off the mouth
of the Albert River, or eleven miles from the proposed
terminus of the railway—at what are known as the
Ballast Grounds. Queensland S.L. Mines directors admit
this, but urge that the “ bar can be easily dredged.
That “ bar” is a little flat, extending for from 60 to 80 miles
in one direction, and from five to 13 in the other ! The
dredge-man is in for a good time.
The Burketown-Lilydale co. has estimated that
the line will cost £300,000, and that £lOO,OOO will be
required for developing and equipping the mines. It is
proposed to raise that sum in London. For close upon

There is trouble alt Gympie (Q.), over the tail-
ings question ; and thl local (Widgee) shire council is
talking fi'dit in the interests of its farmers. Most of the
larger batteries, Scottish, South Glanmire and Monkland,
md the Gympie Crushing Mill are, and the No. 2 South
Great Eastern has been until recently, discharging their
tailings into the Mary River. The river at Gympie flows
through fairly level country and winds a good deal, and
there w very little current. Last few years being dry
there were few freshes, hence the river has become silted
with tailings until it almost isn’t a river. Three batteries
alone (Scottish, No. 2 South Great Eastern, and S. Glan-
ce and Monkland) have been discharging 14,000 tons
into the river per month. The river banks and
flats have always been looked upon as valuable farm-
in"- properties. Now, owing to a thick deposit of tailings
nlaced there by freshes, much of these lands have
been rendered worthless. The influence of these tailings
on the river water is noticeable as far down as Tiaro, 40
miles nearer Maryborough. Farmers also growl that the
river is so thick that it is unfit to water cattle. Lately,
Gympie itself has been warned of the danger, for the
water drawn from the Mary for the town supply has been
threatened with pollution, the site of the town water
supply being only 40 chains above the point where the
tailings are discharged. In fact, a gang of six or seven
men is working daily to keep the tailings and sludge
moving down stream, and prevent it spreading upwards.
The Widgee and Tiaro councils want the mining co.’s to
stack their tailings. The co.’s say the river is the natural
place for them ; hence the argument. No. 2 South Great
Eastern has, however, commenced stacking, and has
space for two years’ material—that is, without elevating ;
but the other mills still discharge into the river. Chief
objection to stacking is expense. But, if they don’t
stack, they will soon have to pay dearly to keep a channel
clear. Even if stacking would cost a bit the co.’s should
do it for two reasons. (1) The tailings would be valuable
as filling in the stopes, and that is the great trouble in
Gympie’s two most important mines. (2) Gympie’s metal-
lurgical treatment (simply amalgamation) leaves an open-
ing for further treatment of tailings. The co. s’ officials
themselves admit the assay value of the tailings to be
about 2dwt. per ton. They have been known to run much
higher. Even if cyanidation does not pay now, it proba-
bly will. The co.’s are sending tens of thousands of
pounds’ worth of gold down stream ; and it is at least
worth holding on to this stuff for a while, even if it
costs a trifle, in the hope that some cheap re-treatment
process will be dug up out of the laboratory.
* * * *
Very little provision is being made for the
future of mining in Gympie (Q.). In the past most of the
gold has simply been stumbled on ; the question now is
whether technical knowledge and training should not he
used to locate fresh auriferous country. Geologists and
other more or less reliable authorities say that the Two
Mile is part of the Gympie field, only separated by a
large crosscourse. What are known as the first, second,
and third beds of slate have been mined to great advan-
tage at the Two Mile ; but the Phoenix slates at that end
of the field have received very little testing ; yet their
existence is almost beyond doubt. A few months back a
meeting was convened to discuss ways and means of
prospecting the district, but only about a dozen were
present. The meeting decided to form a co. of 48,000
shares at Is. each, 4d. to be paid on allotment. A 50-acres
lease was to be taken up, the site to he chosen later on,
and the Government asked to remit rent and survey fees,
and also to subsidise the work. Two methods of pros-
pecting were discussed—viz., by drill boring and by shaft
sinking. Under the conditions, one would feel more in
favor of shaft sinking, for the existence of the slate bed
has already been proved. What is wanted now is to
prove the reefs in the slate. At the first meeting it was
decided that all present form themselves into a committee
to canvass the district so as to dispose of shares, and a
meeting was to be called within a few weeks to elect
directors and choose a site. Government promised to
remit rent and survey fees, but could not subsidise. Still
no second meeting has been held, and it is doubtful if
many shares were applied for. Well, it’s Gympie’s own
funeral.

Re mine names. Under the Queensland law the
prospector must name his claim when he applies for it.
Jack Munro, the North Queensland prospector, overlooked
this ; but by way of general exhortation he wrote —“ This
claim is 0.K.” And so N.Q.’s first div.-payer among the
copper mines got its name.

Carrington’s group has had a flutter in the
Charters Towers (Q.) market, wholly due to a strike in
the Excess ground. This co. has two shafts ; the north
touched the lode in an eastern crosscut two months ago,
and a crushing from a 2ft. body gave a total (including
residues) of £55 from 20 tons. Present strike is in the
south shaft, which has lately been provided with a
hauling plant. At 140 ft. there was a narrow
formation showing, not good enough to move
the market; but at 180 ft. some gold-bearing copper ore
was shot out. Towers market had nothing much to play
with at the moment, and rushed up Excesses 50 per
cent., although all the ore broken could have been
stowed away in the directors’ hats. Still the development
improved the outlook, though Towers speculators left
nothing in the stock to make it worth an outsider’s while
touching it.

Parts of North Queensland are now having
their dry time—the oldest inhabitant can’t remember a
drier. Stannary Hills tin, which was just beginning to
give some hope to its weary shareholders, is threatened
with difficulties in consequence.

Abdul Wade, the camel man, has been in
Sydney, buying more traction engines to shift the ore
and metal from out-hack mines in N.Q. — pretty strong
proof that, up north, the camel is found to be a failure
for this work.

A tribute co. is on foot up north to work
Tartana copper. It certainly is time Tartana started to
produce something besides reports. The tribute-co.
promoters rely mainly on Gibb’s report, which fore-
shadowed something solid in the way of profits.
« * * *
The Broken Hill Prop, is crosscutting the lode at
its deepest level, 1100 ft., and has gone 70ft. without
getting through it. In May last general manager Delprat
estimated the reserves at 3,200,000 tons. At that time
the lode had been pierced at a few points at 1000 ft., hut
it certainly had not been opened up, and it was doubtful
how much of the ore lying between 1000 ft. and 800 ft.
(where the main workings are) had been taken into the
reserves. Northward from Delprat shaft the co. has
about 1700 ft. before Block 14 boundary is reached,
and this end of the mine is practically untouched
below 600 ft. Even assuming that this end of the
mine isn’t as valuable as the south (or Block 11)
end, still it is just about as certain as anything
can he in a mine that there are very large quantities of
ore there which could not have been included in the esti-
mate. Now the big end of the mine has been tapped
100 ft. below the point at which it had been partially ex-
plored last May, and the lode is over 70ft. wide—how
much over 70ft. it is impossible to say. From Delprat
shaft to Block 10 boundary is about 1000 ft. Here, then,
is a block 70ft. by 100 ft. by 1000 ft. more or less
developed since the middle of the year. Possibly the lode
isn’t 70ft. all the way ; the chances are, however, that it
is a great deal wider in places. Add that and the
northern ore to the estimate of 3,200,000 tons, and you
get some idea of the size of the mine. So far as
quantity is concerned, it looks as though the present
generation of shareholders, at any rate, needn’t worry
about the ore-supply.
As to quality of ore at the deepest level in the
B.H. Prop., no assays are reported (the B.H. Prop, rarely
gives figures on this subject), but chairman Harvey
Patterson says it is higher grade ore than at the level
a^ove —which isn’t very serviceable information until the
value of the ore on the' level above is mentioned. But it
at least indicates that the metals are not petering out of
the lode. The Broken Hill mines have generally had the
same experience, and find that the sulphides are not
poorer as they go down. What they have found, though,
is that in most cases they become harder and more
refractory, so that, in spite of repeated improvements in
milling and metal-saving appliances, the extraction is
hardly as good to-day as it was 10 years ago, when sul-
phide-dressing began. And that is why sulphide assays
are worth very little. It isn’t what is in the ore that
counts ; it is what can be got out of the ore payably.
* • * *
Nobody need seriously worry about the Broken
Hill ore-supply if the markets keep good. The markets
make the gamble. Drop lead from its present dizzy
height of £l5 7s. 6d. to £lO, where it has been before,
and hundreds of thousands of tons of the poorer or more
refractory ore must be cut out of the reserves. Of
course, nearly everybody says that the lead-market
is going to keep good now. The same nearly everybody
always has said that during every metal boom, and given
excellent reasons why it must be so. But neither that nor
the silver nor the spelter market has ever kept steady,
and there is no reason to expect that they will do so now
even to oblige Broken Hill speculators. Only this can be
said for certain, that, in the 21 years during which the
Barrier mines have been selling lead, the mean of the
highest quotations per annum has been £l3 10s. and the
mean of the lowest quotations £ll 7s. In an average
year, therefore, the variation has been from £ll 7s. to
£l3 10s. ; and the present price is £ll7s. 6d. higher than
the average highest quotation. The man who would ex-
pect present prices to last must therefore be a very san-
guine person.
* * * *
The silver market is a deep, dark mystery. It
is no use going on the law of averages here. Even during
the Broken Hill Prop.’s brief lifetime, that co. has got as
much as 4s. 6|d. per oz. standard, and as little as a small
fraction under Is. 9fd. The former price followed upon
American silver legislation, what time the U.S.A. tired of
waiting for the world to embrace bimetallism, and resolved
to “saturate itself with silver,” as Moreton Frewen used
to enthusiastically put it, on its own account. Since then
the threefold increase in gold production has killed
bimetallism stone-dead, and silver is slipping out of use in
countries that had long hung to it. It was thought,
when it got down to Is. llfd in 1897, that that was the
bottom of the reactionary movement after the previous
boom, and silver did start to improve ; but in 1902-3 it
was lower than ever—it didn’t go below Is. lOd. till then.
The tin and silver markets always have had much sym-
pathy (most of the tin-getting of the world is done by
yellow silver-users), and the boom-price of tin probably
accounts in part for the present silver quotation of a
shade under 2s. 6d.—the best since 1900.
* * * •
Broken Hill co.’s are rushing out the ore to
catch the high markets. Standard rates of wages haven’t
been put up, but as a very large proportion of the work
is done by contract, rates for that work are set high to
attract good miners. Oo.’s don’t, of course, try to get
one another’s men—or they say they don’t—but all the
same there is warm competition for men who can rush
out ore, and where lls. could be made three years ago
13s. can often be made now. Managers and directors are
. not taking any risks with the tricky silver and lead mar-
kets. They leave that for Sydney speculators, who have
been buying silver stocks more heavily lately than for two
years past, and will presently be left squealing.
*** ' *
J. It. Godfrey, who threw up the secure billet of
N.S.W. Government mining inspector to take over the
management of Broken Hill Block 14, has already quitted
that mine, after less than 12 months’ service. The billet
wasn’t too comfortable a one under new conditions, and
the failure of the old plant to do the things that some of
the directors reckoned it should do didn’t improve mat-
ters. No successor has yet been appointed ; co. is looking
for a man at £lOOO a year.
* * * -K
The half-yearly report of the B.H. Junction is
out ; and Manager Beaumont (who was formerly at the
Pinnacles) gives his first account of the property
“ Results of exploration by drilling and crosscutting-
have placed a considerable quantity of ore at our disposal.
This work has also demonstrated the fact of the irregu-
larity of the ore bodies, and the impossibility of giving
estimates of quantities. The further development of the
mine is necessary, while at the same time stoping to a
limited extent may be carried on.” This is dated Nov. 13.
And on Nov. 27 the mill is set to work. The shareholders
had better face the situation at once. If they want the
mine to make dividends for them, the control must be
shifted from Adelaide. If, on the other hand, they simply
want the mine as an excuse for gambling, they will leave
the control where it is.

It was stated at Broken Hill Block 14’s meeting
in Melbourne that the price paid by the Zinc Corporation
for the zinc tailings runs from 4s. 3d. to 3s. per ton,
latter being the figure for the future output. Last half-
year, working the zincs itself, co. made a profit of 3s. 4d.
per ton ; so the corporation’s price looks fair enough,
provided the mining co. has made up its mind not to
continue the treatment on its own account. The Zinc
Corporation has going in its favor all the improvements
that are likely to be made in treatment during the next
few years ; on the other hand, it has to face a very pro-
bable slump from present high price of spelter.

Coppabella Co. (N.S.W.) has got the returns
from its first 10-ton lot of ore sent to smelters. Gross
return, £lllls. sd. per ton ; “ after deducting all charges,
including £1 per ton for mining and £3 4s. for cartage
and railway freight, a profit of £4 per ton is shown.”
Well, if Coppabella can make £4 per ton on its ore, its
business is to rush it out before the metal markets break.
The mine-owners might reduce costs by waiting a while,
but if it only costs £1 for mining and £3 4s. for freight,
etc., any reduction they could make would not compensate
for missing the present metal markets. It’s like throwing
money away to keep the ore in or on the mine if these
figures are right. The trouble is that they are probably
utterly misleading. How much ore can Coppabella break,
paying all charges at the mine alone, for £1 per ton ?
The £1 per ton is a mere guess ; it is safe to say, though
most of the work the co. has done has been in the lode,
that every ton of marketable ore it has produced has
cost £3 so far.
* * * *
Irving’s Mt. Gifford, which, though in the
Coppabella (N.S.W.) district, refuses to hang on to Coppa-
bella’s tail, has sent away its first parcel of ore to Cockle
Creek. Irving is something of a philosopher. “ Mr.
Came, the Government geological surveyor, has been
here,” he writes, “and declares it to be a saddle reef.
Well, it doesn’t matter much what they call it; the
smelter is best to tell the tale. The Bulletin shall have
statement as to freight, treatment results, costs and
everything else when we get particulars, so that the exact
position can be seen.” They are still tunnelling as
well as shaft sinking. In the tunnel the reef is
3ft. 2in. thick, with a main seam of galena 14in.
wide and another small vein on the footwall; and 60ft.
from the tunnel, where the shaft pierced the reef, latter
was 2ft. wide, with seams of galena through it. It still
sounds encouraging, though, situated as the mine is, the
owners will have to scratch hard to make a profit out of a
14in. galena vein. But, whatever it is, there is good
proof that Mt. Gifford is going to be tested and handled
on its merits. . .

The cable says that English newspaper man
Newnes and his friends are forming a co. with a big
capital to develop the shale deposits of N.S.W. Some-
thing about the Newnes shale business was printed here
on June 15 last. It seemed then that Newnes might have
been bustled into a shale spec., and this paper felt sorry
for him if, as was ascertained on good authority, he had
been induced to put up £lOO,OOO, and his friends had put
up another £lOO,OOO, of which the promoters were to take
£lOO,OOO, besides 200,000 shares. Apparently the business
hung fire in some way then ; if so, Newnes and his
friends have had plenty of time since to make in-
quiries for themselves. If, therefore, they fall in, it isn’t
Australia’s fault. The deposits which Newnes is sup-
posed to have acquired are around Capertee. The
N.S.W. Shale and Oil Co. has been at work there and
thereabouts for 30 years, and by this time it ought to
know every deposit worth having in the district; and it
certainly wasn’t likely to go on working year after year
at poor deposits if good ones were available.’ Yet, working
what no doubt it believed to be the best shale it could get,
this co. in 1898 paid one poor little div. of 2| per cent.,
and since then it hasn’t been able to distribute a penny,
and the last quotation for its shares, 17s. paid, was
sellers 4d. That is the recent actual experience of
Capertee shale-mining, and that is the N.S.W. market’s
most recent estimate of its value. If, in the teeth of that,
J. Bull pays hundreds of thousands for Capertee shale
properties, then he won’t deserve much sympathy.
* * * *
Queen Bee (N.S.W.) shareholders have de-
cided to give a three months’ option to Oobar Gold Mines
ex-manager Pox, who is talking for J. Bull in the matter,
and has £lOOO of Bull’s money to bind the bargain with.
If Fox’s scheme comes off the present co. will get £50,000
cash arid one-fifth of the mine (50,000 shares in a 250,000
share co.). The offer was accepted unanimously. No
doubt. Co. is at present in 50,000 shares, and, though the
scrip has been on the up-grade lately, it has only reached
19s. per share, and present quote is 18s. 3d. To
get £1 per share and a fifth of , the mine
will be good business. But what about Bull ? Sydney
has been valuing the property at £40,000 or so ; now
mine is asked to pay Bull fair interest on £250,000. And
when it doesn’t (as, good little mine though it is, it pretty
certainly will not), then we shall doubtless hear remarks
to the effect that N.S.W. labor conditions are much too
stringent, and that Bull capitalists are consequently shy
of Australian mining investments. “Labor conditions”
are an evergreen scapegoat.

Evidence given before the Victorian Coal Mines
Commission gets more interesting as it accumulates. One
Gippsland mine manager told how a man representing the
Newcastle colliery interests talked smoothly and suggest-
ively to him about closing up the Coal Creek mine, and
hinted at a sum of £20,000. The manager said he merely
laughed ;“ he said he laughed.” As to the value of the
Gippsland mines to the Vic. coal consumers generally,
before Korumburra was opened up, Newcastle coal that
now sells at from 13s. to 17s. 6d. per ton brought from
325. to, 375. a ton. As to the Coal Creek mine, the co. was
originally formed with a capital of £lO,OOO, “subse-
quently increased to 100,000 shares of a face value of £1
each.” Altogether £27,000 had been paid in dividends.
Notwithstanding these dividends, the co. always pro-
fessed itself unable to pay the miners for the slack coal
they hewed. The co. got from 2s. to 7s. a ton for it, but
couldn’t afford to pay the miner who hewed it a blessed
halfpenny. There was no changing-house at the mine,
though the law required such accommodation, and,there
was no air shaft though the department had ordered them
to put one down 12 months ago. Another witness was a
miner who had worked at the Outtrim-Howitt mine on
contract —3s. 6d. for coal and nothing for slack—at which
he couldn’t make tucker. He went to Jumbunnaandput
in eight weeks at 7s. a day. Then he alleged the Outtrim-
Howitt manager saw him casually one day and the next
day he got the sack —of course, a mere coincidence. Then
he tried Coal Creek and was told to start work, but as
soon as the manager got his name he said he had made a
mistake, there was no vacancy just then. He had broken
his leg at Outtrim, but there was no ambulance on the
mine, and he had to crawl out and get to the surface as he
could. An hour and a half afterwards his mates got a
stretcher and took him to the station and sent him to the
Melbourne Hospital—the company carefully docking their
wages for the time they were away.

Prentice and Southern, Rutherglen (Vic.), with
its debt to the State of £20,000, is still pumping water out
of the damp lead and money out of the shareholders’
pockets. This was one of the mines on W'hich the Bull
emissaries who preceded Bewick, Moreing and Co. to
Victoria cast a longing eye. But for once the
Argus had an inspiration, did the right thing, and
blocked the deal, thereby preventing Bull messing
up things, as is his wont when touching deep-lead
work. Since then it has been pump, pump at
the Southern and Prentice shaft, where 2,400,000ga15.
are drawn from the lead every 24 hours. Visick, the
manager, thought that this ought to have let him cross
the lead at the North Prentice shaft. But every time he
tries to get across in his west drive he has to wait for the
water to go down. As his North Prentice dirt averages
about 17Jdwt., he keeps calls low. Still he can never do
more till he makes the western reef. Once it looked as if
he had reached it, but he only found a bump in the reef,
beyond which lay the channel as full of water as a sponge.
The old river bed has now been proved for a width of
1000 ft., and'the one cheering fact is that some of the best
gold seen in the drives is to the west, where the wash is
wettest.

South New Moon, Bendigo, had a mild and
quite unjustifiable boost on the striking of stone in the
eastern ground at 1380 ft. Afterwards, when the market
thought it over, shares flopped down much faster than
they flew up. Co. has got all its payable stone west of
the* shaft, and the new make has no connection
with that. Its value was pretty well determined
when it was passed through in the shaft, and
there was nothing to make a song over. Co.’s yield
on Saturday showed a great shrinkage in gold contents.
This, coupled with admission that the eastern stone was
worthless as far as proved, was too much for the nerves
of some of those who had bought on the hope that a
rise will take place when the crosscut is started out from
the shaft at 1825 ft. As there is a big drain on the stopes
from 945 ft. to 1220 ft., more stone will soon be wanted if
the mine is to show the value of the shares.

Victory, Foster (Vic.), is a mine with a unique
experience. It was one of the assets of the Standard
Bank, which had a poppy-like existence during boom
years. Then it was run by the liquidator, and, most
striking, paid well. Next it came out as a public float,
and with shares taken up privately has been divi-
dend-earning since it was launched* Reef is - very
' small, but rich, ■ the ■ last 295 tons crushed giving
11370 z. Shoot has been followed down over 400 ft.,
where reef is about three inches wide. Country has
been much faulted, one slide throwing the reef 42ft.
to the south west. Now another fault has come in 253 ft.
further ahead, and co. has again to go in search of the
formation. Directors have picked up some leases north
of where they are trying to locate shoot beyond No. 1
break. Some shafts have been sunk on the ground, and
as gold was got there the co. may have a chance in that
quarter.

Victor’s Quartz, Woods Point (Vic.), once upon
a time was a 60s. show. But then came ructions between
the local board and the Victor brothers who had made
their way to Melbourne. So Mackay lost the co., and with
him went the co.’s mascotte. Finally the board let the
mine to a party of tributors on a 20 per cent, footing and
a nominal charge for the battery. And now' one hears
that good stone has been left along the side oFthe bottom
level. From such things arises the saying—“ Lucky
tributors.”

Heathcote (Vic.), dusty and apparently dead
for many a day, buzzed in a mild way last week, when
the M‘lvor Dredging Co. got formally to work. Sims,
sen. and jun., who ought to know the old M‘lvor goldfield
in their sleep, were at the bottom of the enterprise ; and
Castlemaine, which has taken more seriously to dredging
than gny other Vie. town, is at the top of it. It didn’t
cost much to set the new plant going, and successful re-
sults are almost dead-sure.

Phew ! There was something more than the
smell of its Yarra bank manures around the Mt. Lyell
office last w'eek. Fat Willie Knox and “ Hang-it-all ”
Jamieson got a staggerer when the Blue Tier crowd didn’t
shut their eyes to be swallowed up in the Luke Williams
net. How history repeats itself! Crotty first, Madden
next, atfd then Trent, all fought for individual
existence over North Lyell, and lost for the want
of a strong man to advise. Williams pegged all
round the Maddox-Duff claims on the west slope of
the Blue Tier for Mt. Lyell co., and once the tentacles
had got a grip, the octopus yawned wide to swallow
the tit-bits inside. Of course, in the end it will get them
just as it got North Lyell. Then will spring up a 260,000
co., under a dominating Lyell influence, to test whether
the Tier is good or not. Duff wanted his crowd repre-
sented on the board. It was then that sulphur smelt in
the Lyell office as strong as the fumes with which Sticht is
destroying all the vegetation at Queenstown. This was
because of the disregard of the notice—“ No strangers
admitted here.” All the while Bowes Kelly, who is in
with Maddox and Duff, was cavorting in his old resorts in
Argent-street, Broken Hill, leaving Knox to look solemnly
at the aforesaid notice, and giving an occasional side-
glance at Duff grinning defiance.
Of all the doleful shows proved (or disproved)
since the Tasmanian tin-mining boom, nothing was
heralded with more ecldt than the Wyniford. There was
a cheerfully-illustrated pamphlet, with views of the
Briseis workings, mining engineers’ reports, and so forth.
But “ Winnie ” was less winsome when stripped to work,
and there were some shrewd spec, sellers in Melbourne
who did not do any weary-Willie philandering over the
maiden. A change in managers failed to bring up the
yields, and now there only wants one strong, solid man to
give the Wyniford co. its dispatch. Fact is, had it not
been for the boomlet, the Wyniford would have remained
a one-man show, to be worked under the cheapest condi-
tions. As it is, shallow wash, boulders, and hard granite
bars, together with the poverty of the drift, have brought
co. to a very anxious stage.

Mount Todd, between Pine Creek and Katherine
River (N.T.), is promising tin country. Already a score
or so white miners are there, and some hundreds of
Chinese. Drastic steps should be taken to prevent the
scandalous dummying by which other fields in the N.T.
have been virtually handed over to Asiatics. As yet no
claims are dummied, and it should remain so. One show
with.it is estimated, £3OOO worth of tin in sight, has
been sold to a Melbourne syndicate for £2500.

Balmain Ferry Co. (N.S.W.) is very cock-a-
whoop at dishing the Sydney Ferries by acquiring the Lane
Cove and Leichhardt boat services. These have been
under offer to the rival co. for about six months, but a
haggle over the price interfered with the deal. As a
lever, the vendors offered their boats to the Balmain Co.,
which snapped them up. The acquisition of these
steamers means a'good deal in the charter work down the
harbor, where the Balmain and Sydney ferries have met
in deadly competition. Moreover, the Balmain Ferry Co.
can now flaunt its flag at Circular Quay, right under the
nose of the Sydney Ferries’ directors. These latter are
none too pleased at the outcome of the transactions,
which is the first rub their co. has had since the
Government trams turned it into a gilt-edged investment.
Whether the Balmain co. has paid too high a price or not
(some of the “ new ’’ craft are pretty old), it has a chance
of pluming itself as a power to be reckoned with in Syd-
ney harbor ; and it has not the spectre of the bridge to
North Sydney stowed away in its cupboard. The Balmain
Co., however, is badly hit by tramway competition ; in
fact one of its officials declares that the ferry business
doesn’t pay now, and that the profit comes solely from
hiring out steamers to the exuberant people who*follow
boat-races or eat their food on the grass down the harbor.

A 15 inch Suction Dredging Plant is being built
for the Tanjong Rambutan Syndicate of the Federated
Malay States. The plant is similar in design to those now
working at the Pioneer and Briseis Extended Tin Mines in
Tasmania. The 15 inch gravel pump will be of the latest
and most approved design, very strong and massive, and
will be driven by a vertical compound condensing engine,
self-contained and of 250 I.H.P. The centrifugal nozzle
pump will be driven by a separate vertical compound
engine and will be capable of discharging about 4000
gallons of water per minute with a pressure equal to a
head of 112 ft. An Edwards type of air pump, a surface
condenser, and an electric lighting plant will be provided.
Mr. T. R. Toby is the engineer representing the Syndicate
and the Austral Otis Engineering Co., of South Mel-
bourne, is designing and manufacturing the plant.*

The British Broken Hill Silver Mining Co.,
after careful consideration of all types of boilers, have
placed an order with Babcock and Wilcox for three large
boilers, each of 500 h.p. Superheaters, chain grate
mechanical stokers and economiser have also been
ordered from the same firm. This now makes 40 boilers
of the Babcock and Wilcox type supplied to the various
mines and industries at Broken Hill. Wherever economy
in fuel and maintenance of boiler has to be seriously con-
sidered by competent engineers, the Babcock boiler is
installed. Hence the recent unanimous decision of the
Expert Admiralty Committee to install Babcock boilers as
the standard for the British Navy.*

The strength, lightness, durability and low cost
of spiral rivited pipe have given it a place of superiority
above any other pipe. This pipe possesses enormous
bursting strength, and is protected, inside and out, with a
perfect coating manufactured from asphalt. Asphalt
coaled steel pipes have lasted from 25 to 40 years without
any sign of decay, and may last as long again. Spiral
pipe is manufactured by Mephan Ferguson, at Wanganui,
New Zealand, and at his engineering and pipe works,
Melbourne, where the latest up-to-date machinery is also
used for making boilers, fluming, refrigerators, bolts, nuts,
and every discriDtion of cast or wrought iron work.*

“ Abbyj ” : The fish in the Tweed River
(N.S.W.) have recently been dying in hundreds,
while hundreds more swim sluggishly about or
lie stranded in the shallows. Mullet seem to
have suffered most, but there are also bream,
whiting, flathead, &c. The trouble is attributed
to the fluid filth drained into the river by
C.S.R. Co.’s sugar mills at Condong. In fact,
this state of things exists more or less every
season. Is there no legal means of preventing
this destruction ? Men are heavily fined for
not returning to the water captured fish under
a certain weight. Yet here we have a huge
annual slaughter of fish, large and small, and no
notice is taken. Recently, too, there was an out-
cry about net-dragging in the Brunswick River,
but an army of net-fishers could not compass the
destruction now taking place in the Tweed.

“Hamer ” : We stopped in the middle of
a snore to watch the new passenger when he got
in at the N.Q. station, and then we re-started the
quartette. His fooling about with the hat-rack
didn’t worry us, but we woke with a start to
speculate how soon he would break his neck when
he began to climb into it. He got there, and
smiled complacently at us. “They make these
bunks damned small,” he remarked, “Why,
they’re smaller’n on the coast boats.” Then he
went to sleep, and we made bets as to how soon
he would fall on us, and whom he’d hurt most.
MOTOR PUNISHMENT IN SHEOL.
DIABLUS: “ How yon eyeballs glare.”

Prime Minister Deakin, the other day
in the House, promised Langdon Bonython to
inquire “as to the nitrogenous producing plants
being employed by American scientists to improve
the soil.” Probably both questioner and answerer
have an amiable ignorance of the subject. The
“ nitrogenous producing plants ” about which so
much song is raised in America are simply
legumes, such as the cow-pea ; and the planting
and ploughing in of these as “ green manure ” has
been a commonplace of scientific farming for
many years. The system may be seen in operation
at the splendidly managed Hawkesbury (N.S.W.)
Agricultural Farm.
“ O’Fipp ” : Just before Blogg ceased edit-
ing the Boomahjingolong Boomerang he had
things nicely in train for a discussion on “ The
Scarlet Scale Parasite,” which he hoped to make
a burning question in the district. First a letter
was to appear from “ Oppressed Orohardist, ” de-
claring that since the advent of a Labor party in
politics the scarlet scale had multiplied exceed-
ingly on his orange trees, and that this sort of
thing was not to be tolerated by the inhabitants
of a Christian land with British blood in their
veins. Next “Balm in Gilead’s” letter was to
point out that he had a faint remembrance of
reading in Sneak Bits some years before that a
parasite existing in Manchuria was fatal to the
scale. “Balm in Gilead’s ” letter ended, “Let
the Government look tc it ‘ How long, O Lord,
how long?’” But “Bonified Horticulturist”
was then to assert that all right-thinking persons
were agreed that the remedy was worse than the
disease, and that there were already sufficient
parasites in the district (“ Balm in Gilead ” pre-
sumably being one). “Horrified Hort.” con-
cluded—“ Not in our time, O Lord!” Before
leaving on a trip to an adjacent township, Blogg
wrote the three letters, also a leader calling the
local M.L.A.’s attention to the subject, and a
sonnet on “A Scarlet Parasite,” by “Citrus.”
He handed the copy to the foreman, and left him
to bring out the next two issues of the Boomerang,
hoping that with occasional assistance from him-
self correspondents would keep the discussion
raging. But the foreman promptly went on a
prolonged jag, leaving the apprentices to look
aft ■ the paper ; and Blogg was flabbergasted, on
receiving a mailed copy, to find the three letters,
the leader, and the sonnet in the same issue. The
boys had oven left out two columns of patent
medicine ads. to make room for the great scale
question. Blogg tried to make things right with
shrieking subscribers by saying in the next issue
that the correspondents had been shown proofs of
each other’s letters, but various references in the
letters spoilt the explanation. Besides, his “ pro-
prietor” (the local blacksmith) could not forgive
the blasphemy of allowing ads. to be overlooked ;
so Blogg and the foreman are now “ resting.”

“Timbarra ” : My good friend “Yarrum”
(B. 9/11/’O5) says that the oldest inhabitant of his
white-ant-eaten town keeps the ants away by
sooling every single solitary one of his 200,000,000
(more or less) ferocious fowls on to them. The
termite successfully pits liis cunning against that
of God’s own creature, so I don’t see how a silly
old domesticated chook is going to gobble him
up; more so since he always approaches any
building that he attacks by burrowing under-
ground from a distance until he strikes a stud or
post, then eats up the centre of it. Taking into
consideration the termite’s size and the number of
times he is likely to be caught by the oldest
inhabitant’s fowl, “Yarrum’s” story doesn’t hang
together.
“TheProoshan”: “Hexham”(B. 16/11/’O5)
is cocksure “ Old Man ” is useless to protect
peaches from blight. He doesn’t tell us that he
ever tried it, hence, I suppose, his cocksuriosity.
He says poison only does the trick. Now, how
many hundreds of people have failed with poison
—nicotine, &c.—to effectually settle the curse?
Get the electoral rolls, their names appear there
in a long list, from Ato Z. If “ Hexham” ever
comes to Batlow (which can run a good grass-fed
animal in the Federal Capital Skite Handicap),
I’ll show him a row of healthy peach trees, reared
under the watchful eye or potent smell of the
“ Old Man,” with nary an aphis on one of them.

“ Nulla ” on absence of mind :
“ It’s a norrible thing to have a bad memory,” said the
bar-polisher.
“ It is," said the publican, pointedly.
“ There was a mate o’ mine, Bob Cummins, who was a
born general at workih’ points, which he alius spoilt
through his bad memory. The time ’is mother was sick,
they used to send Bob for the medicine. The old lady
used to drink a terrible lot of it—arf-a-wheel a bottle.
Some’ow Bob discovered it tasted somethin’ like pepper-
mint, and after that we used to drop into the old Pick
an’ Barrer pub. an’ swamp the arf-dollar in beer, and get
the publican to fill the medicine bottle with peppermint
and water. We ’ad a lovely time while it lasted, but one
day Bob broke the bottle an’ ’ad to borry one from the
pub. There was a norrible row when he got home. Yer
see he’d forgot the label, and it smelt terrible of whisky,
an’ his pe'ople tumbled, an’ Bob cleared out, an’ me with
him.
“ Barrin’ one week when Bob got some money in a
letter, we ’ad a bad time. The heat an’ flies was some-
thin’ awful, an’ all drinks sixpence, an’ after a while'Bob
said he was goin’ home again. ‘ Any friend of mine will
get a warm welcome,’ he said, and he was right. The
night we marched up to his house the girl what opened
the door took a fit, an’ three or four more came runnin’
out an’started abusin’ me somethin’ awful, while a tall
old bloke (Bob’s father) told us to git before he untied the
dogs.
“Yer see, Bob ’ad forgot all about sendin’ the letter
home, sayin’ as ’ovv he’d been killed in a sawmill an’
askin’ bis people to send a tenner for funeral expenses.
“ He was horrible forgetful, was Bob.”
NOTHING TO WORK ON.
“ Wot’s up with pore Harry? He’s cryin’ like a

“ Well, yer see, he thinks his mind’s failin'.
He's drunk two bottles o’ whisky and ain't

Marida Yallock, M'Kinnon’s smallholding
of 12,000 acres of choice Western district (Vic.) land,
has a quarter mile stretch of local trees leading up
to the homestead, and the wattles, in their spring
bloom, look like a patch of last summer’s sunlight
splashed across the landscape. Other squatters un-
fortunately give pride of place to foreign pines. It
seems somewhat strange that the younger genera-
tion should follow so abjectly in the old ruts.
Because their fathers loved lugubrious surround-
ings and preferred to wallow in the Calvinistic
mud-holes of the past, they consider it incumbent
upon them to do the same. Norwegian pines
seem to belong to the past. They suggest doc-
trines of predestination, lurking assassins and
deeds of blood ; and when the wind is up they
are about as entertaining as a discontented ghost
moaning mournfully through his whiskers.

“ Hamer” : The average pub. in a coun-
try town is a constant amazement to me. In
Maoriland they charge exorbitantly, feed you on
old boots and ironmongery, and have insufficient
attendance for a heavy business. In New South
Wales the hotels are cheap, well-kept, and main-
tain an amazing staff. Is the gentle Bung, who
lounges in genteel idleness while he feeds his eyes
on his solitary guest, a philanthropist who runs an
hotel merely for the good of the town ? . In three
towns I called at I was carried to the pub. in a
luxurious vehicle, dined luxuriously, had a
waitress all to myself, talked with the waitress
(who was a really nice girl) to relieve the dismal
solitude of the dining-room, had a drink with
the landlord to give him encouragement and keep
the beer-pump from rusting, and tried to reckon
how much profit there is to be made out of one
guest at 4s. a day and a shilling for two drinks.

“R. Flanders,” from Leonora (W.A.) :
Wild turkeys are very plentiful in this State, and during
the egg season very high nests are made. Two men
recently knocked down big cheques at Bummers), Creek
Hotel. They had been employed by the turkeys building
nests on day la ">r. This is the best lie I can think of
just now.

“ Yarrum ” : Casey was a new chum. He
was riding between Jembaicumbene and Braid-
wood (N.S.W.). On the plain he encountered a flock
of tame geese that had to be ridden through. Casey
was in a playful mood, and flicked at a tall gander
with his riding-whip. Flying for his face, the
bird grabbed his long whiskers, and the horse
bolted with gander and man in “ holts,” and fight-
ing like fiends in upper air. Last I saw of Casey
he was on foot and very lame. His beautiful
whiskers —all but a few scattered and broken
hairs —had departed, and his curse words were
artistic. He carried half a rail and was asking
after a “ flamin’ ay-mu.”
“Janor”: Struck a party of sleeper-
cutters, t’other day, belting away at one of our
“g.n. resources,” and noticed that the only

“Scatterbrain”: lie the instinct of
pigeons to find their homes. A Daylesford (Vic.)
Bung has a lot of the homing variety. Some short
time ago he sent two eggs from one of his crack
birds to a friend in Tasmania, and he received
word they were duly hatched. The other day two
strange birds arrived at his place, and he swears
they were the two young ’uns hatched in Tas-
mania. [This story would have been complete if
the eggs had rolled home on their own respon-
sibility before being hatched, with the incubator
running after them. —Ed. B.]

“ Drifter ” : Witnessed an almost incredi-
ble happening at the Clyde River (N.S.W.) last
summer. We were on the wharf, watching a
fisherman in the water. He was out almost in
mid-stream, swimming leisurely across the deepest
part, when suddenly he gave a yell of terror and
sprang up completely out of the water. For the
fraction of a second every part of his limbs and
body was horizontally in the air. Small boys on
the wharf, amazed at the feat, called out “Do it
again, Bob.” Bob didn’t. He turned, swam
feebly shorewards, crawled up on to the sand, and
became violently sick. A log, with a fin-shaped
piece of bark sticking above the water, had swept
suddenly against him, and, believing it to be a
shark, he did the calisthenics above-mentioned.

A moving picture of the coming of the
Salvarmy to a Maori settlement, from William
Satchell’s new novel, “ The Toll of the Bush ” :
All te people up there very religiously now. All te
people buy biggy drum and tombones and blow him up
and down te beach. My mother’s father, she very ol’
man—more’n one hund’ed years—he play te tombones
too. When he come down to see us yes'day, he got tom-
bones on his back an’ he play all a time. Then by’m-by
Kanara’s bull he hear him and say, “ Golly, I tink datcow
got belly ache ; I go see ; ” an’ when he see only tombones
he very angry. Pshut ! My mother’s father she clear ;
Kanara’s bull clear af’er him. Te ol’ man make very
quick time and get on top te kumara bouse. Then play
tombones more’n more an’ say “Praise Lord.” But
Kanara’s hull he walk roun’ an’ roun’ an’ say, “ By gorry,
I get you, I break your burry neck.” By’m-by ol’ man do
the haka, an’ while he tance the roof bust up and he fall
in the kumara pit. Then when Kanara’s bull see, he say,
“ Aha ! Goo’ jhob ! ” and he go away.

London Daily Mail’s war correspondent
gives an interesting picture of the “ dogs of war.”
After recording some of the horrible mutilations
committed during the Russo-Jap trouble by
Chinese demons who plundered those left on the
battle-fields, he says
Damage was also done to the wounded and dead by
hungry dogs. These dogs in time acquired a taste for
human flesh. They hang about the battle fields, usually
in threes, and gradually became sleek, in the end calling
to mind the gorged vultures to be seen fluttering lazily
away from the wayside dead during an epidemic in India.
These remarks are commended to the notice of
sentimental persons who compile books of elegant
extracts about “the canine friend of man”, the
canine friend who never deserts the dead body of
his master—while there is any of it left.
THE CATTLE IN THE NIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Have you ever heard the cattle in the night
Break through the waiting silence of the street?
The clatter and the stumbling of their feet,
Passing onwards with a dull insistent beat ?
Have you ever heard the cattle in the night?
Have you ever heard the drovers in the night
Whistle up a lagging cattle-dog to heel ?
While across your dreaming senses fancies steal,
And, once more, the creaking saddle-pads you feel
As you join with dreamland drovers in the night?
Have you ever tossed upon your bed at night
AVondering what can bind the bushman to the town ?
Have you ever longed for moonlight settling down
On the sleeping upturned faces, bare and brown,
Among the whispering tallow-gums at night ?
Have you ever heard the cattle in the night,
The deep sound of hollow lowing in the gloom ?
Have you pined for scent of wattle trees in bloom ?
Have you turned and cursed the close confining room
When you heard the cattle bellow in the night?
QUEENSLAND.

AT THE MOTOR
RACE.
MOTORIST: “Seen anything
of Petrol yet ?”
CHAFFEUR : “No, but I think I smelt him a bit ago."
ir “ Vigils ” : A man went up to the
Northern Territory, the other day, having read
Searcy’s book, “In Northern Seas.” He was a
tired man—wanted to rusticate and have a good
time cheaply, live on fruit, and explore the coun-
try which the Chow had made to blossom like the
rose. After seeing the Botanic Gardens in Pal-
merston, where there’s no fruit, and the Chows on
the fringe of the ocean, where a few weary man-
goes and bananas are to be found, he went up the
line m the Flying Scotchman. In the 140 miles
f , onl y stones and Chows. “ Whereum
trait, he asked the heathens. “No more,” was
the reply. After searching in vain for good things
edible, he went to the Daly River and found a
solitary mango tree remaining from a wrecked
mission station. He has now returned, a dis-
illusioned man.
“Holder” : Re
“P. A.” on the
bullocky’s dog
(B. 9/11/’O5). The
dog which heels
bullocks in the
yoke should bo
made into com-
post as quickly
and decently as
possible, or the
owner will one
day strike
trouble. There
is nothing so use-
ful to the bul-
locky as a good
heeler to muster
his bullocks; but
when yoked it is
another thing.
The unpardon-
able sin in a bul-
lock is kicking,
as his driver has
to crawl about
the beast so much
in tight places;
and nothing will
make a bullock a
confirmed kicker
so quickly as being
heeled at work. It
is about on a par
with the stupid practice of tap-
ping the polers on the horns
with the pin to make them back ;
tap once too often, and you get a
horn poked through you. Or it
is like letting your dog heel
horses in the stable. Some day
you stand behind a horse there
and scrape your foot, or make
some slight noise—next second you
have a hoof through you.
“Val”: I gave a dead snake to
a tame jackass recently. He eagerly
grabbed it with his mouth, and held it there,
slowly disappearing, for three days. On the fourth
day he threw up the bones. [The Bulletin
accepts this narrative in dead silence.]

“ Nulla ” : Sometimes the vegetable John
keeps his accounts in a pocket-book, but more
often he uses the handiest wall for that purpose.
Remember being awakened one morning out West
by what I thought was a violent fan-tan quarrel
in the hotel yard, but on venturing forth to in-
vestigate I found that the uproar proceeded from
Ah Two, who was strenuously trying to dig his
day-book from under the coat of whitewash
administered to the kitchen wall the day before.

llttle Wales town named Olive near the
Queensland border, with a coach route marked to
it from Bolivia (on the inter-State line). But no
one knows anything about Clive. At Bolivia the
name is unknown, and people regard inquiries
about it as a symptom of insanity ; the postal
directory knows it not; and a man who said he
knows the county upside down wanted to fight me
for saying there was such a place when he said
there wasn’t. Was it that a draughtsman in a
state of recovery found a blot on his map and gave
it a name from force of public-house habit ? Or
did Crick put the town on a horse and lose it ? Or
did W. N. Willis take Clive away with him and
drop it overboard as incriminatory evidence?
GODLINESS'S NEIGHBOR.
“’Ullo, Bill, where yer going?"
“ Ter bathe the dorg .”
A. moderately harmless little deception is
practised up in N. Queensland. Sheep won’t
grow in most places there ; and when you ask for
mutton you get goat. There really isn’t enough
difference to make a fuss about between sheep-
mutton and goat-mutton, only there has been a
prejudice against the horny animal ever since
Scriptural days. The local butchers serve up the
despised animal about nine times out of 10 ; but
for the sake of appearances they import a few
sheep from the south (poor brutes—the way they
are handled is a disgrace !), and then, when you’re
eating your goat, you can always kid yourself that
you are the lucky one that is having sheep. North
Queensland is probably the only place in the
world where a sheep supplies more legs than a
centipede.

“ Sam Remo ” : As a term of opprobrium
0.0. W. is short for “ coward,” a term of reproach
that makes most men put up their hands. At
school we made frequent use of the word “cow”
without one thought of horn or hoof. It caused
many a black eye and disarranged nose.

Over in Westralia they recently discovered
a new wallaby, upon which the awful name of
pccrogale lateralis liacketti was bestowed by the
curator of Perth natural history museum. It was
intended as a compliment to honorary doctor
Hackett, who is chairman of trustees, but it seems
rather rough on the wallaby.

“T.A.M.”: Re “ W.H.E.” (9/11/’O5)
on the life of the average State child boarded out.
I am a schoolmaster, and, as such, have been in a
great many parts of N.S.W., and have had
to deal with a good many State kids, and I
have never yet seen one State child treated
even fairly well. One State youngster who
attended my school was boarded out to a cocky,
who, to supplement his income, used to indulge in
“’possum shooting” during the winter months.
The cocky and the lad would tramp through the
bush every moonlight night till the moon got too
low. The cocky was well-booted and wrapped up
and carried the gun, but the youngster, who had
to do the skinning and carry the ammunition, had
neither boots nor coat. After the shooting was
over they would return home, the youngster
carrying the skins, hung on the barrel of the gun,
while the cocky smoked his pipe and cursed him
if he got a little too far behind. When home was
reached they would both turn in. The cocky
would sleep till late, but the State kid had to be
up at 6 a.m. to peg out the skins. Fagged out
with over-work and want of sleep, the miserable,
small object could do nothing but yawn all day
at school.

There are two historic Norfolk Island
pines in Sydney Botanical Gardens. The one
known as the “ wishing tree ” has recently been
measured, and its height proved to be 99ft. 3in. ;
when measured a few years ago it was over 100 ft.
The second pine is 118 ft. 6in. in height. These
trees are said to have been planted by a man
named Ned Shakely in Governor Bligh’s time, 99
years ago.

“ The Prooshan ” : Wombats have an eye
to comfort in the construction of their camps.
After tunnelling far enough, they “ sink a rise,”
as Cousin Jack says—that is, work up a few feet,
and then start on a higher level and make an
elevated platform for their roost. This done,
t ley take in ferns, bushes, and grass, and make
everything snug.
DESOLATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
L
Let me sit and rest a little in this well-remembered spot
Where the lories chatter shrilly, and the sun strikes not
too hot;
Where the breezes from the ranges wave the gum leaves
to and fro,
Whispering of youthful pleasures as they softly come
and go.
Twenty years 1 Good God, a lifetime 1 And it seems a
tiny span
Since this place was humming gaily with the sounds of
beast and man ;
Crack of whip and curse of driver as the big logs tore a
path,
Leaving undergrowth and saplings draggled in the after-
math.
This old log whereon I’m sitting, this grey ghost of
brighter hours,
I remember stretching cloudward ere he fell amid the
flow’rs;
Now the songsters of the bushland at the passing of the
day
Perch themselves on younger branches and look down on
his decay.
In the elbow of the river is what’s left of Bunby’s mill—
Just a blackened heap of sawdust, and a few posts
standing still;
And across the river, yonder, where the weeping willow
falls,
See the outline of a cottage, broken roof and moss-grown
walls.
Jennie Hall dwelt once within it—outwardly so good and
bright;
Inwardly (she was repaid it), Jennie Hall was black as
night.
Do I wander? Why this groaning? At the wrong end of
my life
When my blood is flowing slowly I should sure be done
with strife 1
Yet I’d like to see her sometime—just to tell her, once
for all,
That some life is still within me, and I’m glad she had a
fall.
Bah 1 the sun is sinking rangeward in a blazing ball of red,
Touching all the bush with orange, painting things a
long time dead.
I must hump my bluey farther—four miles yet to
“ Splitters’ Rest ”
(For these nights grow damp and chilly, and I find a pub.
the best);
So I’ll leave you now, old gully, as the shadows grip your
sides,
Leave you to the bear and mopoke, and whatever else
betides.

address must appear on MS. No liability is under-
taken re contributions voluntarily submitted , whether
sent by post or handed in ; and no MS. will be
returned unless stamps (of any State) accompany.
Cosmos : There are some beautiful but vague
sentiments in your letter. For instance, “ The spirit that
underlies Protection is the same spirit that makes nations
go to war.” Putin other words “It is the spirit which
makes nations defend themselves when other nations go
to war with them.” Also “ Protection has driven
American shipping off the seas.” But American shipping
hasn’t been driven off the seas. It got a severe set back
through blockades and privateering in the Civil War,
when the U.S. didn’t go in much for Protection, but it is
greater now than it ever was before, and ranks next to
the shipping of Britain. The “ Statesman’s Year
Book ” (1905) says that the shipping of Great
Britain and Ireland is 10,208,604 tons, and that
of the United States 6,087,345 tons. Moreover in the last
year covered by the “ Year Book’s ” statistics, U.S. ship-
ping grew faster than British... W.0.H.: “Potters’ Buck”
was returned simply because it was rejected. If we sent
reply in the envelope with a foreign stamp (upside-down)
on it, which you enclosed for the purpose, it would cost
you 4d. fine Chips : Your North Queensland rag has
embezzled Grant Hervey’s verses from The Bulletin of
November 2, and tried to localise them with horrible con-
sequences... .Campfire : Not brilliant lies.... A. J.C.:
Contributions sent are of little value Wurrym : The
idea was Hop’s own device and the picture had been on
hand some time P.J.D. : Small sentiment enshrined
in small verse... .T.C.S. : How can The Bulletin
prevent him “ dropping out! ” He writes nothing now. It
is impossible to publish the writings of a man who has
ceased to write and shows no present sign of resuming....
C. Julius : Thanks for correction. “ Retrospect ” is
rather flat and feeble Ne’er-do-weel: An older con-
tributor has a prior claim on your pen-name; take
another. Yerse facile but futile Wisht Warner : Well,
there will be no ambiguity this time. Both are bad—
inferior in every way. Also, they cost us 4d. short
postage H.C.O. : Elegant, but empty Dynamo:
Neither true nor useful nor amusing Argument :
Coghlan (“ Australia and Maoriland ”) gives average
wages from 1872 to 1879 in Sydney : Carpenter 9s. lid.,
mason 10s. 7d., boilermaker 9s. 6d. ; laborer’s wages
varied from 6s. to 7s. Id. “Statistical Register,” last
number, quotes carpenters from 9s. 6d. to 10s., masons
11s., boilermakers 10s. 3£d., laborers 6s. to 7s. Id. No
records available of movement of miners’ wages on par-
ticular goldfields....W.F.S. : Falls very flat Mars:
“ Dreamer ”is crude and feeble Obi: Not well enough
handled A.J. : Verse impossible. Par. good; but
please observe, for future guidance, that we’ve made it
say in about 150 words all that you used 400 over
Moocher : Hardly worth the space Helen A. : A pro-
mising effort C.W.T.: Tawdry and hysterical Wom-
bat : Neat verses enough, but not a spark of poetic
inspiration R.L. : “Return ” declined with emphasis.
....W.H.R. : “Refusal” can be put in five words :
“Things ain’t what they seem.” Z.X. (Syd.): N 0....
Digger : As it happens, those lines were not the poet’s,
but were interpolated by the editor in polishing up the
contribution for publication... .Virtus : Too strained....
Tom K. : Good, hearty cussing, but not verse... .N. W.S. :
Yes, doubtless Nancy was a nice girl, and far away in
Africa you feel that you must write poetry about your
recollections of kissing her by the slip-rails in this
country. All that is quite right; where you mistake is in
sending the copy to a newspaper. Send it to the girl....
T.P. : “ To-morrow ” is very jagged metre ; if you fixed a
handle at each end of it you could saw trees with it....
H.B. : “ Angel Progress ” reads like a vague attempt to
open up a stupendous theological problem Needle-
wood : “ Nemesis ” is too horrible. After reading it we
can almost seethe blood and the mud and the funeral
and all the rest Bud : “ Moonlight Message ” just fails
to overtake the vehicle... .Observer : Pitchforked to-
gether ! Note how matter is arranged in print before
jou try again... .Nerrinyeri: Doesn't give a strong
enough impression of actuality... .H.W.N. : Too much in
the nature of an essay... .Jackdaw: Story not well
enough told. Sketch suggestion too odoriferous....
Spen : But he doesn’t write all his own gags, and his
brother wasn’t a popular comedian—he w asn’t a comedian,
nor was he popular on the stage or with audiences
Scotchmer: “Game of Life” came within an ace of
success. Try some more.. .. J.E.B. : “Corn” gives a
general impression of being good verse if we could only
decipher it... .Carl Clifford : Neither is far off the mark.
Just a shade too mechanical.... W.M. : “ Earthly Love ”
was getting on pretty well when your “ humble lyre ”
burst M.L.W. : "Spring Afternoon” throws no new
light on the sky-and-grass subject, and its remarks about
daisies are trite A.F.P. : “Shipwreck” cost 4d. for
deficient postage, and if we sent it back in your envelope
with 3d. worth of Victorian stamps gummed thereon it
would cost you Is. for deficient postage. Stamps of other
States should be enclosed loose George : Declined.. ..
S.P.B. : Felt reluctantly compelled to pour water on the
“Gleam of Hope,” and it fizzled out.. ..Geo. H. : Sorry
we can't agree with you about what you call the “in-
famous gag.” It is most salutary and necessary.
Also the dissolution Watson asked for wouldn’t
have made the closure any less necessary. Fur-
thermore, Deakin couldn’t coalesce with Watson in
the way you describe, for the Labor party isn’t
taking any definite or permanent coalitions
E.A.S. : Well, The Bulletin didn’t pay Mr. Flavelle, of
the Stinking Fish party, for that liberal advertisement
about its influence in England and the size of its circula-
tion there.. ..D.B. : Dialect stuff should be very legibly
written F.G. : Hypocritical snuffle of that kind is too
common to call for notice Angela : You think it’s
“fairly good.” But we like things unfairly g00d....
B.F.N. : Modelled on Meredith, but lacking the pregnacy
that lies behind his eccentricity of style... .Drum-
mer : Cut out and post to Bulletin accountant....
Barbara : Both alive ; one in poor health, and the other
not expected to recover Dingo : Photo, of the dog of
the man who didn’t win the big sweep received. It
doesn’t look any great shakes of a dog Two Seas:
That land argument has been so often put before in The
Bulletin. We believe in closer settlement by adequate
land taxation R.N.C. : You start off well with the
heading, “Orange Bill’s Inquest,” and then tail 0ff....
General: Dogs and hogs verse not up... .E.G.8.: Verse
hopeless ; par. more promising E.E.F. : Have not the
slightest knowledge of having received any “ journals,”
and you don’t even mention in your excitement what •
they were.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
Byrock : Picture of disembowelled Russian declined
N.S.: Thanks, but we have never been able to find out
that putting a larger amount of wool on a dray than was
ever put on a dray before is of any real benefit to the
country... .A.J.: After some hesitation can’t chance it.
There is an old and mossy air about the joke... .Hewett:
Perspective bad and clouds look like whitewashed
footballs... .Butch : Wouldn’t publish such a picture of
a boy on any account. He is a Horror Liggy: No
demand for portraits done with one continuous line on
the spiral spring principle.,. .J.H. : “Deauch and
Dhoris ” m'ght be worse, and it could also, without
bursting its boiler, be a good deal better.

Said that N.S.W. ex-solicitor David Chen-
hall, who made a little spurt in the Sydney papers
some two years ago, has now left for the U.S. A.
Ex-Minister and Labor-leader Johnson,
of Westralia, who less deserved to be beaten than
probably any other member of the party, promptly
looked up his carpenter’s tools again, and is now
back at his trade.
Re dead Premiers (mentioned in Bulletin
9/11/’O5). Old George Throssc 11, of Westralia, is
only politically dead. He was very ill recently,
and had a look over the fence into the Hereafter,
but he didn’t climb over.
The Rev. Pearce Carey, the small perky
Baptist parson who was not long back imported
to fill the pulpit of the Collins-street Baptist
Church, has seized upon Orangeism to give him-
Bslf the boom he might not otherwise raise. He
is now known as the Rev. Fierce Canary.
Premier Price (S.A.) had one pet lamb,
and, when shearing time came, he got Lundie
(sec. of the Shearers’ Union) to shear it under
union rules. He told the Assembly proudly that
there wasn’t a dispute right through the contract,
but everything went on smoothly to the end.
“ Nulla ” writes :
A prominent speaker at the recent Hen Convention,
where, amongst other things, a motion in favor
of colored labor was carried, is the wife of a country
storekeeper who, a short time back, took part in the
agitation against the competition of Chinese storekeepers.
Maoriland is erecting a monument to
parson Marsden, who preached there on Christmas
Day, 1814. Notwithstanding vigorous whipping,
neither Sydney nor Parramatta has put together
enough money for even a freestone statue to the
violent old Samuel.
A Sydney shopwalker was threatened with
dismissal the other day if he did not at once pro-
vide himself with some front teeth. He lost a
couple of teeth lately, which, according to the
boss, destroyed his value as a walker. He couldn’t
smile properly without all his front teeth, and his
grovel was depreciated.
Chaffey Baker, President of the Senate,
got a knock when the House discovered that,
whenever he travelled on the Adelaide express,
he reserved two berths, one for his lordly self, and
the other, presumably, for his boots. The House
failed to see why the country should be called on
to pay £lO 10s. for a double berth for Baker and
his boots, and struck the item out.

It isn’t every man who can paste his trade
advt. on to his friend’s coffin ; but G. H. Reid
did it last week. To both morning papers he
supplied an “ appreciation ” of the just-dead J. H.
Want—a practically word-for-word “apprecia-
tion,” so that the thing was apparently done in
cold blood, and committed to writing. He de-
scribed how, lately, the K.C. came into the
barristers’ room, threw off his wig and grown, and
said he was “ done.” Then—
“ There’s one thing, old man. My stopping will open
things for you, and I’ll do what I can to have my briefs
sent along to you.”
“And with her dying words, she says, ‘Maria,’
she says, ‘ I shall never go out no more by the
day,’ she says, ‘ but if ever anybody needs a job
done by the day,’ she says, ‘ then all I can say is
that I knows of no one more satisfactory to do it
than you, Maria,’ she says with her own dying
lips, * and I hopes as how my old customers won’t
ever forget it.’ ” The man who told the tales of
Mean Streets might write something of the sort
concerning a Sairey Gamp whpse fine feelings he
wanted to pourtray; but it seems that even a
K.C.’s feelings are sometimes fine enough to per-
mit him to give himself the same sort of testimony.
Hugh Nelson, a pretty sick man these
times, will, it is understood, give up the Presi-
dency of the Bananaland Leg. Council very soon.
One crowd names Premier Morgan as a likely
successor. The anxiety of one crowd to provide
some other billet for Morgan is about the most
touching feature of politics up North these times.
Lionel Terry, who shot one aged Chinaman
at Wellington (M.L.) as a protest against yellow
labor, has been sentenced to confinement for life.
Yet in South Africa the ruffianly mine-manager
who flogged over 1000 Chinamen in one month,
to screw out bigger dividends for his German Jew
bosses, hasn’t even been arrested.
. Mr. Naltamer, a Japanese gentleman, has
been doing the usual horrible proceeding in New
York. On the ground that the peace treaty was a
disgrace to his country he disembowelled himself on
the roof of a very tall hotel, and then threw himself
over into the street, quite regardless of what Ameri-
can citizen he might fall on.
The things that might have been expressed
differently were illustrated by the advertisement
published by the Licensed Victuallers’ Association
of N.S.W. re the decease of “Jack ” Want. The
aggregate liquor trade deplored the loss of one
who had been an ornament to the Bar ! Just as if
the late K.C. had been in the habit of taking a
threepenny drink at the counter of the Pig and
Whistle.
A few December birthdays :—Ex-Premie
Butler (S.A.), 55 on the 3rd ; Senator Zeal 65, and

most of the flourishing institutions of Adelaide, 47

Remarkable personal item from London
Free-Lance :
Mr. Seddon was a blacksmith. Another notable example
is Mr. Deakin, Premier of Australia’s oldest State—New
South Wales. Mr. Deakin—as all Australians know —was
educated in a State school, and left at the age of 16. His
ambition was to be a carpenter, and a carpenter he
became. In the workshop a trade dispute arose between
the union and the employers, and young Deakin expressed
his opinions in such forcible terms that he was elected
spokesman for the employees. His eloquence won the
men their point, and at the next elections he was asked
to stand as a Parliamentary candidate. As is usual in
Australia, the election expenses were paid out of the
party’s funds, and, on being elected, the new M.P.—or, as
they are called out there, “ Member of the Legislative
Assembly”—received from the Government the sum of
£3OO per annum. That is the fixed stipend for all mem-
bers. Since then Mr. Deakin has held many positions in
the Cabinet, and now holds the most honorable of all—
the Premiership.
Late “Jack” Want’s
sledge-hammer jaw was not al-
ways the right sort of jaw. He
never got on very well with the
cow-like juries of the buttery
parts of the State. They like to
be smoothed and stroked and
purred to : and Want couldn’t
purr. When the Broken Hill
strike “conspirators” were put
on their trial it was a toss-up
who should be asked to be their
leading counsel—Wise, Want,
or Reid. Want had just made
a slashing attack on the strikers
in the Leg. Council. They
found out, however, that Want
was prepared to defend them.
The strike committee jumped
at the chance. “Here,” they
said, “is what we want. We
are misrepresented; if we
weren’t, the public would be on
our side. Now we shall be able
to say that before he inquired,
Want was against us like the
rest; after he inquired, he was
for us.” Yet Want, though con-
fident, could not win the case
when the venue was shifted to
Deniliquin, and a jury of buco-
lics empanelled. They couldn’t
understand his sledge-hammer-
ing ; but Coffey, on the other
side, talked to them like, a cow
and a brother, and, as they pro-
bably didn't understand too
much about the complicated
matter, they took his word for it
and convicted.
The Tory S.A. Opposition
is in the hands of the children
of Israel, Cohen, deputy leader,
and Solomon, whip, running
the guerilla warfare against the
Government. The nominal
leader, Butler, has just gone
into an auctioneering business,
and lets politics slide a good
deal while he knocks down small
substances with his little ham-
mer. Besides, his speeches often
indicate he is in sympathy with
most of the Government mea-
sures. More than once the nose
of Cohen has flushed with indig-
nation, and Solomon has been
unable to find words to express
himself, as Butler voted with the Ministry and
against the bulk of his party. Butler still weeps
a good deal about his wrongs, but he can’t weep
Comfortably in the same bucket with Cohen and
Solomon.
“Itan”: Fate decreed that “Jack” Want
should not attempt his contemplated arch-destrov-
ing crusade against Australian union. Nine
months ago he told me, at Brisbane, that, in a
year, the time would be ripe for his scheme, and
he would then lead a campaign to burst the Fede-
ration. Three months later I saw him again, and
found that the desire for distruction had waned a
little. He said that, if he could enlist the help of
five others willing to share the toil and expense
he would sound the tocsin, but his proposed lone-
handed campaign was off.
With “ Jack ” Want passes away the last
of the fighting members of what was once known
as the “Old Jack Robertson” political crowd.
Dibbs, Copeland, Garvan, Slattery (politically dead)
differed from Robertson from time to time, chiefly
through the machinations of Parkes, but there
was a bond among them, and they always
came together again as soon as explanations were
made. Want was the medium of reconciliation
on several occasions. Political principals were not
of much consequence in those days, personal liking
and social habits being the main factors in the
constitution of a party.
THE MASONIC SIGN OF NATIONHOOD.
Japan is going to borrow £50,000,000.— Cablegram.
The name of Fattorini, so prominent in
the Dailey divorce case, is an old one in New
South Wales. In the late twenties Dr. Charles
Lammonerie Dictus Fattorini was in practice at
109 Pitt-street, Sydney, south of Bathurst-street,
and opposite the old Ebenezer Chapel. He and
Dr. Bland were physicians to the Benevolent
Asylum. Later on he lived in Upper Castlereagh-
street. In later years he leased land in Druitt-
street, corner of Kent-street, from W. C. Went-
worth, and built there; the house, this writer
thinks, still stands. The doctor left Sydney and
took up his residence at Port Macquarie, where
he died in October, 1853, aged 55 years. His son
was stock and share-broking in Sydney in the
booming seventies.
Amongst the N.S.W. barristers now
clothed in “stuff” who propose taking “silk,”
Langer Owen, son of Justice Owen (and on whose
account the Judge left the Equity Court), was
called at Lincoln’s Inn, London, in June, 1888.
Adrian Knox, who belongs to the “sugar”
Knoxes, was called at the Inner Temple, London,
in 1886. Both are in Equity. A. G. Ralston, a
relation of the late Justice Windeyer, belongs to
N.S. W., was called in 1884, and practises ex-
clusively in Divorce. Wilfred Blackett is also an
Australian, called in 1887. The “father of the
stuff gowns,” C. B. Stephen, called in N.S.
Wales in 1870, has no hankering after “silk.” He
earns a large income at certain Chamber work,
which the etiquette of the Bar would reauire him
to give up if he took silk, and C. B. Stephen is
apparently not taking any.
Oliver Bainbridge, who hung about
Australia recently and professed to have dis-
covered murky naked Jews in Papua, is
now (presumably it is the same Bain-
bridge) holding forth about a find of yel-
low Jews in China, and proposes to pass
the hat round to buy them a synagogue.
But the yellow Jews of China, and the
black Jews and white Jews of Cochin,
and the Arabian Jews, and the
Abyssinian Jews, and the Jews of
Tartary and Bagdad, and the Jews of
Morocco who keep harems, were all
known so long ago that Oliver Bain-
bridge has a very poor show, His
frenzy for discovering old, exhausted
Jews that were known before he was
born will yet lead some tired Hebrew I
to hit him on the head with a Tal-
mud. Nothing worries an old-estab-
lished race more than being suddenly
discovered in this way.
The latest charge against the
Federal Government is that it “starved ”
that eminent scientist, Clement Wragge,
out of Australia. The Moisture De-
partment, in which the doubtfully-useful
Wragge was engaged, was never under
Federal control, and Wragge was never in
Federal employ; but when the anti-Federal
liar is on the job, he is capable of accusing the
Australian Government of brutally neglecting to
provide refreshments for Julius Caesar.
“N.”, on a bit of history
Bendigo Bishop Langley has raised a storm of pious
indignation by hinting at Nelson’s Lady Hamilton. “ Oh,
no, we never mention her.” Somethin g tangible. Emma
Lyon was born in very humble life about 1761 (died 1815).
Became a nursemaid. Went to London, where she is
alleged to have figured as shop girl, ladies’ maid, bar-
maid, and a nymph of the pavement. Became the
mistress of Captain Payne. A quack named Graham
engaged her as Goddess of Health for his earth cure.
She was exhibited buried up to her neck in the ground.
Next heard of as mistress to Sir H. Featherstonhaugh.
He cast her off for being too giddy, and she sank into
great poverty, living with her faithful mother, who went
under the name of Mrs. Cadogan. At a former time she
had a child, apparently by the Hon. C. Greville. He now
took her as his mistress, and bestowed much care on her
education, she having been utterly ignorant up to this
time. The name she went under, chopping and changing
about like her class, was Emily Harte. Greville had por-
traits of her painted by Reynolds, Hoppner and Lawrence.
In 1784 Greville’s uncle, that grand old foozleberg Sir
W. Hamilton, English Ambassador at Naples, came
to England, and fell in love with his nephew’s charmer.
She was transferred as mistress to Hamilton, under the
odd and easy style of the aristocracy. He took her to
Naples, where they lived together. Before leaving
England he tried to introduce her to the Queen, but
majesty sniffed contemptuously, and would not receive
her. However, Marie Antoinette did so g'raciously, in
Paris. At Naples she became the confidante of the
Queen, Marie Antoinette’s sister. Hamilton married her
in 1791, when they were on a visit to England. In 1793
Nelson first saw her at Naples, but they did not
become acquainted till 1798, after the battle of the Nile.
It is not generally known that besides Horatia (said to be
Nelson’s daughter), she had another daughter by Nelson,
which died in infancy. In 1813 she was placed in the
Queen’s Bench prison for debt, and remained there about
a year. She got out on bail, but apparently there was
connivance at her escape to Calais, where she died.
Daughter Horatia became the wife of Rev. P. Ward, and
lived till 1881. Before marriage she lived with Nelson’s
sisters. Yet there are doubts whether she was really
Nelson’s child.
A very efficient lady artist in Victoria has
surprised her friends by marrying a man
who will be about three hundred feet be-
neath her as a general thing, her husband
being a working miner in Gippsland. The
story is a miniature romance. The artist
went to the Gippsland bush with paint and
ware, seeking local color, and wishing to
rent a convenient cottage she interviewed
the owner. He was a strapping young miner.
“No, I won’t rent the cottage,” he said
promptly, “but you can have it if you’ll
marry me.” Offer refused. The lady built
her own cottage, but the miner was so pleased
with his original idea that he persisted,
and eventually succeeded in persuading her
that nature had designed them for each
other. In order that the design might not be
frustrated the wedding happened, and now
there is one cottage to spare in their locality.
The death of J. H. Want leaves nine
K.C.’s nominally at the N.S.W. Bar. Of these
Salomons doesn’t appear in court, likewise Dr.
Donovan, who is so disgustingly rich that he can
do without practice. Wise is in England. Pilcher
is going there. Jumbo Armstrong is an acting
D.C. Judge and a Crown Prosecutor. Cullen is
at the Equity Bar, Gordon in Bankruptcy, Wade
is Attorney-General and full of the cares of
office, leaving but G. H. Reid and R. M. Sly at
the Common Law Bar. Sly is a lawyer, and no
speaker, Reid is a speaker and not much of a
lawyer, hence suitors at Common Law have little
choice.
There would be no harm done if King
Edward pardoned the mates of Kiely, who
has just been pardoned through the repre-
sentations of the Commonwealth Government.
Only two of these old Fenians now remain
under the ban of the law in Westralia. Close on
60 were transported to Westralia 37 years ago for
complicity in the Fenian movement. Some
escaped, some were pardoned, and some
died. The last three, Kiely, Kileen and Duggan,
have of late years been an eyesore to all who
wished to forget the mad folly of James Stevens,
the plaster-of-Paris head centre. Kiely and
Kileen were soldiers, and Duggan was a school-
master.
Rev. David Laseron, who was shot by
Thomas Walker (recently elected on the Labor
ticket to the Westralian Assembly) is reported
now to be a life assurance canvasser in northern
N.S.W. By the way, has Thos. Walker ever
compensated Laseron in any way for the pain and
expense to which he put him? He might, at
least, have handed over to the injured Reverend
the copyright of his wonderful drama, “Mar-
mondelle the Moor, ” to show there was no ill-
feeling.
Premier Bent, discoursing at Elsternwick
(Vic.):-
He knew the recreation reserve 32 years ago. The
Ministry had wanted to sell the land by auction, but he
said “don’t.” The people who built houses would have
been four feet under water. A few years previous to that
he was “ stuck up ” by wild bushrangers just opposite the
Elsternwick Hotel. He meant where the Elsternwick
Hotel now is. He was one of a party of 40. They were
stuck up by bushrangers from Tasmania, and three of the
bushrangers had pistols, so that settled it. The whole 40
of them were brought into Sargood’s paddock, and they
were all searched there. He was not very big then, of
course ;it was quite 40 years ago. At allevents the men
with the pistols robbed the whole party.

more !

JEAMES: “ But I have admitted him. He says

“Drifter”: I attended a private spook
seance in Sydney, one night recently. I was
ushered into a big, dimly-lit room which
served in the day time as the dining-room of a
struggling hash factory. The smell of “stoo”
still clung tenaciously to the heavy atmosphere,
and there was a whiff of sausage in one corner. A
shadowy circle of figures spread around the dining
table. Hands were placed on the board with
fingers interlacing to form a magnetic current. Seen
through the gloom each face wore an expression of
tragic earnestness. The medium, a faded, middle-
aged lady, sat before a slate at the head of the
table, and stared with a deadly, fish-like stare at
the discolored ceiling. Her hands twitched and
vibrated like the last wriggles of an assassinated
serpent. The assembled shades in doleful, under-
ground tones commenced to drone “Abide With
Me.” I watched a gleam of hysterical force gather-
ing in the medium’s eye, and clung tightly to my
chair. Suddenly she made a grab at the pencil,
wrote as if driven by an evil spirit, turned the
slate with a crash, finished the spirit’s message,
threw the pencil down with a squeezed-out gasp,
and fell back exhausted. A pale-faced nervous
youth struck a match and laboriously deciphered
a wild, incoherent message. He suggested a dead
mummy lighting his pipe in the middle of a
pyiamid. For over an hour, amid the
gloom, dirges were wailed, and the recu-
perated medium rose to the occasion with
“messages” from the cold, pale, blank tomb.
Intermittently a succession of uncanny raps
sounded under chairs, and the table heaved like
the board over the top of the bottomless pit when
a blast of hot air comes up. I asked for the Cup
winner, and during a long dismal psalm “Mam-
opoto ” bolted on to the slate. Then the smell of
the “ stoo ” began to weigh me down. Likewise
the gloom and doleful assemblage filled me with a
longing for air, and I and another unbeliever crept
away and left the pale flabby ghouls still whisper-
ing and breathing heavily and rustling in the
semi-darkness.
The old Emperor of Austria is anxious to
spike the gun of the Hungarian malcontents by
granting universal suffrage throughout the empire,
and Hungary, which has been crying out a great
deal for freedom, objects violently. The curious
position is that the Hungarians so-called (the
Magyars) don’t constitute quite half the popula-
tion of Hungary, but the other races are divided,
and the Magyars, by faking the vote, or disfran-
chising other races, or by sheer brutal terrorism,
have kept them quiet while they demanded sepa-
ration, and liberty, and the right to wallop the
Slovaks, Roumanians and sundries. Universal
suffrage would turn the Magyar flank badly by
sending to the Parliament at Budapest a majority
which would rather trust the German bureaucrats
at Vienna, or even the devil, than take its chances
with Kossuth’s countrymen.
From London Referee :
In the week ending September 23 the returns of
pauperism in England and Wales for the preceding month
were issued. At the close of a glorious summer, whilst
the rigors of winter are yet far away, whilst the Board of
Trade returns are being triumphantly appealed to by
many statisticians to prove that the commerce of this
country is increasing by leaps and bounds, the ratepayers
of England and Wales are taxed for the maintenance of a
greater number of people who cannot support themselves
than they have ever yet been called upon to feed, clothe
and shelter at any given time since pauperism began. . .
The one Freetrade nation in the world is the nation
which maintains the greatest army of paupers.
Curiously enough, no one seems to have
thought of alleging that Socialism was driving
rabbits out of the country.
“ Tim ” from more or less accurate obser-
vation :
What terrible wives policemen do get hold of ! I live
near three married “ Johns.” Mrs. No. 1 is a big, strong,
healthy-looking woman, who was never once suspected of
doing a hand’s turn. Her constable has to rise early in
the morning, clean up, cook the breakfast, get half-a-
dozen kids ready for school, then go out and catch bur-
glars. His wife appears about 11 o’clock clad in a dress-
ing-gown, and passes the morning hanging over the front
gate. Policeman No. 2 is not much better off. His wife
does the light housework, also all the row-making for the
whole of the street. He does the scrubbing and washing.
Policeman No. 3 doesn’t do any housework. He just
comes home, hands over his wages, sits down, and keeps
quiet. One Sunday he told me that things were going to
be different at his place, and that he was going to stand
up for himself. Next pay day he came tearing' round to
iny house in a highly-excited condition, with a stream of
blood, tea leaves and jam coursing down his countenance.
He had stood up for himself, and his wife had smashed
the tea-pot over his head, then hit him behind the ear
with the jam-dish as he sped out the back door. When I
had finished lending him the necessary first aid he was
like a raging tiger, and said, as he rushed off, that he was
going to tear his missus into little bits, then kill himself.
Five minutes later he was out in the back yard chopping
wood.
“ F.C.” : I witnessed a domestic squabble
with embellishments the other evening. I was
dining in a sixpenny hash-house when a respect-
able-looking working man sat down alongside.
He had had, perhaps, two beers, but was quite
sober, and drank his soup like a gentleman. He
was about half-way through it when a tall, neatly-
dressed woman marched in and stood opposite
him. Then, to the waitress, in a strident voice,
“No, I don’t want any tea ; but he can have a
restaurant tea while his wife and children are
starving at home.” He looked up momentarily,
then placidly continued consuming the soup.
Pointing to the semi-bald spot on his head, she
commanded, “Go home ! Go to your starving
children, your dying baby ! ” The rest of the
customers were much interested, one or two
women being amazingly sympathetic. When he
had finished his soup, he ordered steak and
casually desired his wife to sit down and not
make an exhibition of herself. Again the strident
finger pointed and the accusing voice rang out,
“ Where are your wages ? Give me them ! ” She
turned to the room generally—■“ Here he is living
on the fat of the land ” (the boarders snickered
here, while the missus scowled), “ and boozing his
wages while his little boy and girl starve at home
and the baby is dying for want of a bottle of
magnesia.” The waitress brought in his steak
just at that point, whereupon the lady grabbed it
and sat herself down opposite me. “/will eat
this ! /, who am starving ! ” she said. The husband
assured me, in a voice intended for the whole
room, that, though he hadn’t handed his wages
over, he certainly hadn’t drunk them, and that
there was money in the bank if she wanted any.
Then he paid for the tea and departed. There-
upon nearly every woman in the place crQwded
round and sympathised volubly, and descanted at
great length on the villainy of men in general and
this one in particular, so I strolled out. Return-
ing just an hour later, I observed the lady still
dallying with the remains of her meal and sur-
rounding her fourth cup of tea. I had a .dim
notion of suggesting that she might hasten home
with the remains of the food to the starving
children—if they and the dying baby weren’t
already dead —but I restrained myself in time.
That sort of interference leads to complications.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, November 28, 1905.
My Dear Arini,—.
A man prankt in strange trappings of rolled
gold and the embroidered skin of a young goat
held what seemed to be a clinical thermometer
■ against the side of the memorial stone. He took
its temperature, so to speak, then placing his
hand on liis appendix he almost broke in two say-
ing, “ Most Worshipful Grandmaster, the stone is
plumb.” Other gentlemen tested the rock with
other fancy implements and, bowing, reported
in mysterious language that it was properly
set. The incantation proceeded by the pour-
ing out of a libation of wine, knocking
the stone three times, singing of words by
a body of men suitably ornamented with young
goatskins, and invocations addressed to the great
Architect of the Universe.'
All this has reference to the laying of the
memorial stone of the Nurses’ Home at
Prince Alfred Hospital “in Masonic fashion”
by Earl Jersey lasc week. The incantation
rites were carried through by Masons with
the Earl and Grandmaster Remington as the
chief Capricorns. It wasn’t as funny as the
philtre scene done by Howard Vernon in “The
Sorcerer” but it was just as dignified. In
the invocations the Almighty was credited
with being a master craftsman in various trades
and professions. “Great Architect of the Uni-
verse,” moaned the Earl. “ Great Artificer,”
supplemented the stately Remington. “Boun-
teous Author of Nature,” prayed a gentleman
with a banner. “ Gigantic Bricklayer ” and
“Enormous Carpenter ” the others ought to have
murmured, but they missed their cues. A lot of
doctors were present, and one could feel their
subjective personalities winking at one another
and snapping derisive thumbs. Medical men are
out-and-out unbelievers—small blame to themsofar
as Masonic mummery is concerned. Prof. Stuart
kept clear of the incantation scene, but he made an
elegant speech, and his name is graven on the
stone that is plumb. If only three witches had
rushed nine times round the stone with a burning
torch apiece, to finish the proceedings, all would
have been well.
Lady Jersey, in artistic mourning—she keeps
her girlhood’s figure, and her eyes as bright as a
girl’s—saw the fee-faw-fum ceremony through,
seated between pretty Mrs. Anderson Stuart (all
in bhm raiment and white ostrich feathering) and
Mrs. Kater, with Mrs. James Fairfax to make up
the quartette. The Jerseys are going to stay some
weeks with the Raters, at Moss Vale. Mr. K. is
a very big wool, and also vice-president of the Com-
mercial Banking Co. Miss Newill, matron of the
P. A. H., prettily laundered, looked reverently at the
magic rites around the stone. Miss Rose Scott was
there with the American tourist, Miss Brecken-
ridge. This lady and her party are by way of
being much paragraphed. The American lady,
though in the vicinity of the seventies, is as alertly
interested in the problems of progress and poverty
and education as she was in her younger days,
when she founded clubs and was on boards of
educational concerns in San Antonio, Texas. And
she is slight and upright, and wears such a perky,
round toque, a little on one side. Her brother,
who accompanies her, is a banker, and has lady
clerks in his money store. One of the party
is a journalist in the Texan city, and is like-
wise soaked in municipal and educational
and for-the-good-of-our-race questions. Think she
was a little disgusted at the first eager questions
of an Australienne : “Texas? D’ye know Owen
Wister? He who immortalised Lin Maclean, in
‘The Virginian’ and ‘Red Men and White.’
What is the inner meaning of that frog story ? ”
The party can’t talk Wister, or Bret Harte, or
cowboys at all. Perhaps many an Australian in
San Antonio and elsewhere couldn’t talk Henry
Lawson, or discourse on dodging the boomerang
beside the Finke River.
It was very cute of Prof. Stuart to remember
and ring-in Lady Jersey’s words, said years ago,
on the requirements of a good nurse : “ Good
health, good temper, a good head, and a good
heart.”
Saturday afternoon at Randwick racecourse was
a gentle, soothing function. The announcement
that this meeting was a complimentary one got up
for Lord Jersey’s joy, and that any joy he wasn’t
using was intended for the Chelmsfords, did not
bring * a crowd. Lady Chelmsford, very tall
and slight, with dark hair, good teeth and a
clearly-pale face, will do Queensland proud.
She was clothed in soft cloud-grey clingsome
clothes and a pale blue boa. Five children,
it may be remarked, form the C. family.
He is a tall, oatmeal-biscuit-complexioned
man with soldierly figure and bearing. They
are staying at Cranbrook. The Darleys
were boxed with the C.’s, and the Cliieftainess—
who is coming out brilliantly since the announce-
ment of her widowed daughter’s engagement
to Viscount Sudeley’s son—was in forget-me-not
blue raiment. Two young mamas, Mrs. Oswald
Watt and Mrs. Harrison-Smith, were also in the
pen, but there was nothing remarkable about the
latter save a calamitous hat; and the former left
early with her warrior boy. He had to go and
storm a fort —in a motor car—at Bondi or some
such naval base. Mrs. Philip Morton was to the
front in a redingote and other things. Skirt and
’gote were of the same material, a kind of clear
black-and-white check making for a grey effect.
Her youngest sister, Daisy, a big-eyed girl with
an Alice-in-Wonderland expression, was around
with Mrs. Phil, dressed as to color reminiscent of
Burns’ daisy, the one that he told “ I maun crush
thee ” and wept over. Champagne colored shoes,
dozens of them, flattened the grass, and lace
scarves with deep fringes were present in plenty.
The guest of honor, Jersey, played nearly all the
time in the front yard of the members' stand.
Lady Northcote is doing the self-effacement act
most thoroughly so as to give the Jerseys all the
lime and footlights. When the J.’s arrived, Lady
N. stayed in the railway carriage until they disap-
peared with the full band ; then she drove to
Government House through a tunnelled way or
by back streets, or in some such fashion.
The largest thing of its kind in the way of
Town Hull entertainments that I’ve seen during
the time that I've infested Sydney was the Allen
Taylors’ evening reception to the Jerseys. The
scheme of decorations was large, striking, and
well-defined. A thousand extra lights were used,
and the bulbs of the electrics were dyed to a softened
shade of cerise. There must have'been a few miles
of foliage garlanded below the balconies, and
fifty palms lifted their fronds under the rose-
light. Baumann’s, too, did a record piece of
catering. They had the 2000 or so guests all
down to supper at the one time, and every sup-
perer found seat and meat. Lady Jersey and
consort, the Mayoress, Mayor, and Town Clerk
Nesbitt formed themselves into an unlimited lia-
bility company for hand shaking purposes. The
visiting Countess heavily jewelled her black moire
antique gown with diamonds, back and front.
Next to her in Arabian Night effect was Mrs.
Frank Gardner.
Mrs. Francis Suttor, back from her trip, was
there. One of the loveliest dresses was that of
Mrs. Burdekin, reminiscent of a cloudless summer
sky at midnight, “softly dark and darkly pure”
as Byron has it. For the rest it was a sapphire
chiffon powdered with star dust —or sequins.
Phenomenally small-waisted daughters were with
her. An English paper, otherwise quite sane, is
running a crusade in favor of small waists. It
says the era of the greatest refinement
was marked by the 17-inch waist. Tears and
swoonings possibly show refinement. Wonder if
Joan of Arc, the Maid of Saragossa, Florence
Nightingale and the like wore 17-inch belts, and if
Boadicea rose against the might of Rome in a cast-
iron corset. Hundreds of shining, ebony black
frocks punctuated the crush. Mrs. Layton had a lot
of Parma violets on hers. Mrs. J. C. Williamson’s
gown was like the Safrano —that coppery-yellow
decorative rose. The crush was so great that you
had to burrow for your friends. Only Rosalindish
women like Miss von Arnheim, Mrs. Jack Toohey
and Mrs. Arthur Turnbull could be easily signalled.
Two ex-footlight dazzlers pranced at the Jersey
run. One trailed an adorable gown with over-
blown yellow roses on its champagne sur-
face. Her other skirts were yeasty in
their lightness and her shoes matched in
color all the skirts and frills. A winey effect
altogether. A chorus girl showed a conventional
figure in a silk knitted jersey—possibly as a com-
pliment to the noble guest who is Earl of that
garment. A pair of pale green gloves, worn with
a linen frock, got several cold glances, but, accord-
ing to a fashion rag, Paris gets rid of its njoney in
the forenoon dressed in white linen and with frog-
green, or baby-leaf green, gloves on its salary
hooks.
An Adelaide correspondent writes :
Miss Maud Puddy, who for years has been the show
pianoforte pupil of Adelaide Conservatorium, goes to
Germany to study early next year. Miss Puddy is clever,
but the popular opinion seems to be that she should have
been sent away five or six years ago if she was to make
anything of a name for herself. Anyway, the feminine
pianist hasn’t much chance of achieving fame, because
she can’t wear her hair long enough without being taken
for a lunatic. Adelaide, which exports two or three
geniuses a year, is giving Miss Puddy a complimentary
concert, and threatens to turn out in great force for the
occasion.
A returned Cupper says that she saw but few
Sydneysiders at the race meetings —the crush was
too great. But she ran against pretty well every-
one she knew in the shops, looking for hats.
Women are always hunting that elusive bird, or
portion of a bird, the ideal hat. Sometimes they
catch it, but, by the irony of Fate, that is at the
times when there’s nothing worthy in the way of
functions to wear it to, or when the weather is
bad, or the other woman isn’t there to be riled.
Never the time and the place and the right toque
all together, as Browning didn’t remark. I sup-
pose that when Melbourne women come here they
pay our hatters the compliment of sampling local
stocks. The distant hat always looks green.
My Cupper friend also found to her surprise
that the Mother Shipton type of hat is already
“in” in Melbourne. It has a very narrow brim
and otherwise is just like an inverted flower-pot.
Not one has appeared in Sydney. The description
is not enticing enough to induce one to pawn one’s
breakfast cruet to buy a capsized straw vase
in which to plant one’s head. Fantastic shoes are
also worn by the Melbournians, says the commen-
tator. And their short frocks are shorter than
ours. If one wears phantasies on one’s feet why
hide them with long skirts ? Japanese sunshades,
too, are “in” in the southern city. “Bring us
our Nogis and Togos,” called out one of two sisters
to their maid. And the girl brought two Jap
parasols.
Gerrard, the actor, always attends ten o’clock
Sunday service prior to going fishing in some
sunlit cove of peace. The other Sunday he came
to his official prayers dressed in white pants and
striped flannel coat, and carrying a hamper as
big as a door. There’s an access of young
woman worshippers at that church. They say
Gerrard prays better than he acts. Also that he’s
better looking off the stage than on. He himself
confesses that he’s “the dead spit of Napoleon.”
Mr. and Mrs. Harold Perkins, a young English
couple, have been much in evidence lately in
Sydney society. Mrs. Perkins, who is an in-
tensely blue-eyed blonde, dresses in foreign crea-
tions of taste and splendor. Her husband, an
English barrister, came to Sydney to draw
£104,000 (resumption claim money) from the
Equity Court.
Only millionaires, according to R. S. Smythe,
should be operated upon for appendicitis. At a
cimique in the Bois de Boulogne £4OO was the
fee asked by the leading expert in the disease, and
£3OO was the sum actually paid by a friend of S.’s
to get rid of his appendix. Consultation fee was a
hundred guineas. These charges are much higher
than in London, where Sir Frederick Treves will
prune and diminish you for a hundred guineas.
But, then, all the rich Americans go to Paris —
either for millinery or deletion of the appendix.
Another Australian novel, “Helene of the
Blaekall Range,” is on its travels. The author is
a Mrs. Crawford, who canvasses lives for the
National Mutual. Her late husband—he lost his
life in the burning of an hotel at Wellington (M.L.)
four years ago —was once a Sydney pressman.
From an English paper :
The hearts of the women of Great Britain should be
grateful to the Princess of Wales to-day, for her royal
highness graciously allows a description of the gowns
made for her Indian tour to be published.
Talk about being grateful for small mercies ! And
the State gowns were made out of England
according to the same paper. England didn’t
get the work or the profit or the credit, and it
didn’t even see the gowns, but it got the
description.
The Kelso King girls left by the Marmora on
Saturday “to get carpets for their new flat.” So
slight an excuse for taking so big a trip shows
what good sailors they are. The Blackwood naval
bride also departed by the same vessel. The word
“naval ” reminds that the new flagship “ Power-
ful” will be here next week with a swarm of possible
husbands on board. Lady and Miss Fanshawe
with their butler and maid, join the vessel at
Fremantle. Sydney society is spitefully joyous
over the fact that there was no move to present
the departing admiraless with a farewell jewel.
She kept all the ten commandments, and the
whole of the cardinal virtues, and all the city bye-
laws, and rules of etiquette in such a perfect state
of shine and repair that Sydney felt its moral fur
stroked the wrong way.
Frederic John Napier Thesiger, otherwise
Baron Chelmsford, at least knows something of
the three R.’s. He’s an M.A. and barrister-at-law,
and looks more than his 37 years. His consort
Frances Charlotte is a Churchill on the maternal
side and their eldest son is nine years of age.
After which slab from the Peerage I hasten on
to matters which don’t roost so high in the cold
atmosphere of aristocracy.
No reasons are asked or given as to the whaffor-
ness of certain fashionable persons in this city
going back to their ancient fervor of Hebraism.
Julian Salomons has taken a seat in the Synagogue
after years of absence from that temple. And
the Gollins, after marrying their two daughters
to pure merino Osborne and naval officer Black-
wood respectively, have also resumed devotions at
the old address.
A correspondent, signing himself “T.D.”, re-
ports on Merely Mary Ann as she is in London :
The servant girl in Australia may be a trifle independent
in her manner, and may have a bad habit of offering back-
talk, likewise of choosing her own time for doing things,
and of going home to spend Christmas with her people,
and in the same manner selecting an inconvenient date
for getting married, and she may have other defects, but
she’s a saint with a beautiful halo of whirling dust com-
pared with the London “skiv”—which word I under-
stand to be newly-invented slang for the Merely Mary
Ann creature. The London girl commits all the crimes
above-mentioned, and also those labelled “miscellaneous,”
and in addition she is the most dishonest slattern on this
earth. I’ve encountered not a few at boarding establish-
ments of my frequentation, and with one possible excep-
tion, about which I’m wrecked on a shoreless sea of doubt,
they have all pilfered right and left, whenever anything
worth pilfering was lying round. Fancy studs, books,
pen-knives, odd coins,' photos, of beauty actresses, &c.,
disappear with alarming rapidity ; likewise, patent medi-
cines are assiduously tested, and a new variety of corn
cure will vanish like a beautiful dream. The other day
two fellow boarders of mine missed, one his false
teeth, and the other the exquisite switch of golden
hair with u'hich she makes herself of interest to the critical
male. These losses were too severe, so search w T as made,
and it resulted in discovery of the missing articles in the
servant’s bedroom. As the girl herself is of another color
in respect of her hair, and as she is already so well sup-
plied with teeth that two of them have been crowded out
of the stalls, so to speak, and into the orchestra of her
countenance, I presume that she stole the articles from
sheer force of habit. The same thing must have happened
three days before, when she swilled off a mixture of four
different kinds of patent medicine and some salad oil,
which I had specially prepared for her. I noticed that she
was not herself for a day or two after partaking of my
hospitality, but when she isn’t herself she is somebody
equally undesirable.
Mr. “Jack” Want died in his prime, as age of
men goes to-day. He was twice married, his first
wife being a Miss Prince. She died some years
ago, and the great lawyer married the widow of
an Adelaide medical man. She had two daugh-
ters whom he formally adopted. Mr. Want leaves
to his widow and children a sum of between
£20,000 and £30,000.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.
It; is generally thought that there is no
cure for stoutness, because the usual treatments
only confine themselves to combating single
symptoms instead of attacking the root of the
disease. Pyrolene Pellets remove not only the
superfluous fat, but also the internal deposits of
fat which hinder the action of the heart and lungs.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, November 27, 1905.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The Grey Dame, of Stonington visited a pic-
tured “Grey Dame” in the studio of artist
M’Cubbin on Monday. She does a picture show
rather intelligently and not a bit like the Tal-
bottle himself, who is very dreary when he isn’t
merely automatic. She sails round with her
lorgnette and an encouraging smile. Sometimes
she points. This is quite cheery and informal.
Whenever she wants to be friendly, she points or
uses her aristocratic hand in play. Anything of
the kind is evidently intended to convey the news
that her Ex-ship is a live mortal, and not a mere
automaton worked by wires to do V.R. duties.
The “Old Girls” of the Presbyterian College
gathered for a convivial munch of the social muffin
t’other afternoon, when the sky showed turquoise
gleams and the earth smiled golden. A muster
of Old Girls is sometimes droll, sometimes pathetic.
There are the sere and yellow spinsters wlm ..ore-
gather with the fat, jolly mothers of the State.
There are the social failures, showing up drab and
grey beside the gay successes, arrogant in their
glory. All kinds of emotions are brought into
play. The sight of the present pupils brings its
pang of regret for the old days to a few, and a
glow of emancipation to those who are not yet old
enough to sigh for what belongs to the past.
The Tasmanian Fyshes left for the Flyspeck
Isle last Wednesday, after the long (or decayed
ling) politician had shown a large wedding assem-
blage the swell-draper fashion of giving a bride
away. Nothing so beautiful has been seen at any
church ceremony than the Fysli fashion of “ walk-
ing this way ” down the aisle of St. Peter’s. The
wedding guests were tremendously impressed. It
seemed as if the Tasmanian chiffon man had been
practising the giving-away act all his life.
Dickens’ Turveydrop would have processed and
given a dancing pupil away in marriage just in
the magnificent Fysh manner.
There’s great attention given here to such
societies as that for the advancement of Plain
Needlework and for the Rescuing and Drying of
the Fly in the Milk Jug. But why—oh why—isn’t
there a society for the advancement of Plain
Womankind, and another for the Promotion of
Masculine Attention to the Surplus Sex ? It seems
that too much time is given up to the imperfect
stitch and the trodden-on puppy while surplus
spinsters are left to wilt in neglect. Some
humanitarian should start a society to lessen the
sorrows of the wallflowers.
The Lachlan Mackinnons made a festive de-
monstration on the anniversary of their wedding
the other day. They are a comparatively young
couple, but they naturally consider that any
anniversary of so important a union is a great
event. It is in the same spirit that a certain
kind of person grows wildly excited on the annual
re-appearance of her birthday—an ordinary thing
that everybody has.
The death of the veteran dame, Mrs. Richard
Grice, has thrown a great clan into bereavement
garb. The handsome old matron had a numerous
family and a school of grand-children, and was the
most famous of a trio of strenuous dames, the
other two being Mrs. Sumner and Mrs. Osborne,
who still lead a rather vigorous existence and look
after a host of grand-motherly cares. The late
Mrs. Grice was one of the most consistent bene-
factors of the Anglican Church, and her generosity
to the poor at all times leaves <a fragrance about
her grey memory. As a type of upright, splendid
motherhood Mrs. Grice should have a memorial.
An awkward mistake, or a little printer’s irony,
crept into a newspaper report of a meeting the
other day, when it was set forth that some
hundreds of “the feeding citizens of Melbourne
assembled,’’etc. Presumably “leading” was meant.
But after all they’re practically synonymous.
The Leading are the Fat and the Fat are the
Fed.
A recent bride marched up the aisle to the
hymning of “Oh Welcome was the Call ! ” a week
or two ago. That’s the most appropriate chant
that has yet chorused for an up-to-date sacrificer
to Hymen. Welcome? Ratherl
The rush of mayors, magnates, Jellybys and
other small charity committee fry to help fatten
the funds of the Epileptic Home has been over-
whelming. All because the Grey Dame of Stoning -
ton blessed the Cause, and started it. going by a
public appeal and personal prayer. The Toorak
section responded, and got itself thanked in the
most cordial Talbot manner. It also, in a few
particular cases, got itself asked to tiffin. Then
the mayors and others with family axes to grind
set forth to help the fund. Talbot smiles were
measured out to them—only smiles, not biddings
to a Stonington spree. Later the Mrs. Jellybys
started a pin-cushion show in the cause, and La it
in such numbers that the Grey Dame’s thanks gave
out —ran down like an over-taxed clock—and now
a shoal of motley bazaars, concerts and fetes are
under way to swell the funds, and they must all
go past without much more than the mere approval
of the V.R. personage.
Beechworth excited itself over the recent
exodus of three girls to South Africa. They are
setting forth under the pilotage of a bachelor,
who is acting as deputy Cupid for three
faithful ex-Victorian “boys,” now established in
a remote African quarter. It isn’t often that
three boys and their corresponding girls maintain
so much faithfulness at long range. The deputy

CURED BY CUTICURA
IN ONE MONTH
Mrs. George H. Tucker, Jr., 335 Green-
field Avenue, Milwaukee, Wis., is a
grateful mother. “When six months
old,” she says, “my little girl weighed
a pound and a half less than at birth.
When one month old a scab formed on
her face, spreading until it completely
covered her from head to foot, followed
by boils, having forty on her head at one
time, and more on her body. Then her
skin started to dry up, and it became
so bad she could not shut her eyes to
sleep. One month’s treatment with Cuti-
cura Soap and Ointment made a com-
plete cure, and now my child is as
large, strong, and healthy as any child
of her age. The doctor’s and drug bills
amounted to a large sum, and my baby
grew worse all the time. Then we got
Cuticura Soap and Ointment and cured
her at trifling expense.”
CUTICURA A BLESSING
To Skin-Tortured Babies
and Tired Mothers.
The suffering which Cuticura Soap and
Cuticura Ointment have alleviated among
the young, and the comfort they have
afforded worn-out and worried parents,
have led to their adoption in countless
homes as priceless curatives for birth
humours, milk crust, scalled head,
eczemas, rashes, and every form of itch-
ing, scaly, pimply skin, and scalp
humours, with loss of hair, of infancy
and childhood. A warm bath with Cuti-
cura Soap, and a single anointing with
Cuticura Ointment, purest and sweetest
of emollients, will permit of sleep for
baby, and rest for mother, and point to a
speedy and permanent cure in the most
distressing eases, from infancy to age.
Cuticura Soap, Ointment, and Pills, are sold throughout the

Nothwithstanding the ENORMOUS SUCCESS

THE MARVELLOUS CORRICKS,

Revolution in Tariff, viz.—2s. and Is.

had a delicate commission, but in each case the
lady lent a ready ear to the message of Love.
Last week the young man sailed away with the
cluster of brides-elect amid the cheers of the local
population. What a blessing if a few other
signing 1 African swains would commission a chum
to entice their adored ones to pack up and sail
away and so relieve the glut of the more frequent
and picturesque sex on the market! What
a greater blessing if there could be an inrush of
swains who’d marry the Australian girl here !
A foreigner who runs a cheery flat in the
neighborhood of the wool-stores calls the snuggest
department his “combination room,” which is
just a way of indicating that his smoking and
eating rooms are in one. Many flatters sleep, eat
and toil in the one den, converting the furniture
into day or night use by an ingenious lightning
change at which all the city denizens are
adept. When you are offered a perch in a cosy
corner by the flat-hostess (who may be called the
flattess for short), you may be really sitting on a
be-draped wash-stand, or a decorated kitchen
dresser, or a disguised meat-safe, or a meta-
morphosed tub. You never know till the drapery
gives way, and you fall into the chest of drawers
or project a foot into the bread-bin. The genuine
Bohemian in a flat drapes nothing, and you know
without inquiry that you are resting on the meat-
safe or the bed or the wood-heap.
Toorak guesses “there’s something in” the
almost simultaneous setting-out for the Cold
Country of a certain young official and a saucy
local charmer. The pair have been chummy, and
the simultaneous flitting is regarded as significant.
Its never allowed in these cases to be coincidence.
I here s no such word as “coincidence” in the
gloomy vocabulary of the suspicious.
Baritone Haigh Jackson looked sheepish on
returning to the Itoyal Comic ranks after the fare-
wells and the speeches and the silver presenta-
tions. He was due to step aboard an English
liner when the Firm button-holed him and
pressed a re engagement (worth while) upon his
attention. He recalled his deck-chair and set
back to the theatre. But what of the farewell
trophies ?
The two rival Conservatoriums hold year-end
shows in a week or two. Marshall Hall’s team
still makes the bigger and the better fight. The
I etersons are too gentle and ladylike to be pro-
Peily assertive, and they don’t bang or explode.
At a recent knot-tying all the best presents
received by the bride were branded “made in
Germany, until she wondered if her friends were
playing a joke on her — She is a local production,
and her groom has no claim to German extraction.
'T no i oke \ Much of the showy silverware of
the day the kind that affects novelty or massive-
ness—bears the label of Kaiser-land. Australia
digs up the silver dirt; the foreigner does the rest.
Mrs. Talbot the Tasmanienne who owns rela-
tionship of a remote kind to the Victorian Reggie
—hied back to her isle and the comforts of the
Malahide domicile last week. The dame in queS-
tion, with the wealthy Grubb clan, made the best
chiffon show among Cupping Tasmanians this
year.
The moneyed Smiths—ma and the youngest
chick—have landed back from the Big Smoke with
great talk of gadding Australians, of the wool
clans anchored there, and other gilded ramblers
basking along the Mediterranean shores.
Pasteboards bearing the sign of the Wallaby
Olub in the corner summoned a mixed assortment
of tnskers to a lawn party at the Australian Par-
liament grounds on Saturday. It was the first
spree extended by the Wallaby brethren (who are
bookmen, bards, and political blades) to outsiders
it was a rather tame show. The Wallaby hosts
looked a shy lot (Senator Cupid Keating particularly
so), and though a quartet of dames tricked with
croquet mallets and exercised their train frillies
over the close-shaven lawn, the excitement kept
at a low ebb. Bananalander Higgs, who was with
his dame, loomed like a sombre note of exclama-
tion on the scene, and the six-foot-six of R R
Garran struck an even taller note of sad query.
In spite of Mrs. Isaacs capacity for keeping up
her end of the (croquet) stick, things languished
considerably. Now the Wallaby Club thinks
it is better to go off springing from its tail
on the country roads o’ Saturday noons, and not
to break into frilly excursions at variance with
its early resolutions of exclusiveness.
Mrs. Blake, the rich little widow of the Miller
clan, takes her petite self and chick back to Europe
before the start of 1906. Up to the present
she has revolved sedately at the Grand. A widow
who is rich, pretty, young and sedate, strikes the
interested public in the light somewhat of an
honest lawyer or a humorous parson. It upsets
one s theories.
Ever since a witness in an insolvency case told
the local Court that, though his wife’s income
averaged £lBOO per year, they had both been in a
chronic state of impecuniosity since the knot-
tying, bachelors have been sitting back and pro-
nouncing new vows of celibacy. It’s a great sin
tor a daily press—generally so intent upon helping
on matrimony—to publish such shockful informa-
tion. What use to theorise about the value of the
respectable married state to the public when the
papers print such alarming facts ?
The repent Yank papers tell of a little Jap Miss
who punished an annoying male by throwing him
in the streets of New York according to the iiu-
ptsu methods. When the large victim was still
stroking a bruised head and suffering from the
hing, the Muss called a member of the force and
gave the alleged ruffian in charge. Subsequently
in Court she repeated the turn, with alacrity, the
polite and willing interpreter this time suffering
the jiu-jitsu turn—his fall shook the very walls
and convulsed the onlookers. Physical Culture
Schools ought to take warning. If all the students
learned to throw a cwt. or two of strange man
whenever he grew aggressive in the street, the
police would be saved a lot of trouble.
Miss Nellie Stewart is not likely to return to
Roo-land after her Yank tour in a hurry. Sweet
JN ell hopes to make a hit in U. S. A. If she doesn’t
it will be a terrible blow, and the old favorite will
not hasten back here to have her tears dried.
A likely engagement has collapsed owing to the
inability of the mixed couple to identify sport and
art interests. They tried to amalgamate but it
didn’t work, and now the youth redoubles his
sporting interests and the pretty charmer con-
cerned is more than ever devoted to Art.
Merchant Henry Butler spends a large share of
his days working up presentation-mugs and pickle-
stands to departing magnates, retiring Worships
and such. The last was a marble bust of Sammy
Gillott, which marble image was served on the
original ope recent noon, much to the nervousness
of the ex-Mayor. In grace after the gift Samuel
expressed his joy in handing the Carrara image to
the City Council, to enhance the collection of
municipal celebrities already represented in oil or
putty. The brand-new mayor took it over, pro-
mising the donor to give the bust a most pro-
minent place in the Council Chamber.
Mrs. Thonemann still lingers abroad for health.
Meanwhile, Toorakites miss her hospitality, the
dame being one of the few to treat flutterers to
full-sized spreads.
There are five kiddies in the Chelmsford
entourage. It seems a most plebeian quantity.
Most Governors permit themselves one chick, if
they indulge in posterity at all. There’s no olive
branch in the two Vice-Regal arbors hereabouts,
and the last Victorian Ex. only boasted one tender
sprig. A Vice-Regal coming along to one of the
States with a bunch of five seems as though
Imperial attention were being given to encouraging
that birth-rate.
The troops who took part in the King’s Birth-
day Review at Albert Park (Melb.) were just
about full-up of it when the performance ended.
Previous to the actual review, they were twice
paraded for the benefit, seemingly, of the
clanking staff which needed to learn its part.
The 2000 men and their immediate officers had to
roll up, like a thoroughly efficient theatrical com-
pany, in order that the “star’’staff might get
some more rehearsal whilst the military Hamlet
of the occasion jotted down notes of stage business
on his shirt-cuff. And, after all, the performance
was considerably bungled. Only two personages
Northcote and Talbot—should have been treated
to strains of “ anthem ” and salute of arms, but in
addition to these Lord Jersey, and the Governor
of Tasmania, and the Admiral were received with
musical honors, and the gaudy function positively
reeked of God Save the King.
Mrs. Maesmore Morris shed a few salted pearls
aboard the Oinrah, last Tuesday, when the Morris
clan, some members of the Musgrove co., and a
knot of the lady’s profile admirers waved their
hands in farewell. The small son helped in an
affecting tableau with mama. On this side they
say a millionaire waits in the Big Smoke to plead
his cause with the languishing lady.
Miss Fabiola Twomey, one of the most forward
of the young Victorian artists, hangs a large num-
ber of her clever canvases on the walls of Bernard’s
studios at the start of December.
Miss Frankie Oliver and Mr. Stuart Murray are
making up their youthful minds to face the Eden
Chant early in the new year. Toorak thinks it
just as well. An engaged couple is of absolutely
no use to decorate a scene for social purposes.
When married they become of service to society
once more.
The Holy City promoted a giddy dissipation for
the Governor-elect of Bananaland when he touched
at that port —a Carnation Show.
Some of the festive Cup visitors from other
States worked havoc in the hearts and homes of
certain local philanderers. The wool quarters echo
with one desperate affaire, and theatrical circles
with another. In the latter case, the Eve from
another capital offered inflammable attentions to
a charming stage Benedict, who had not the
brutality to reject them. Wifie reproached him
with unwonted enthusiasm, and there was trouble
in their dovecot for several days. Now the clouds
have rolled by and absent sinners are never men-
tioned.
The signboard of “ Scratchings ” hangs in the
most inappropriate place both at Caulfield and
I lemington. It should loom up on the- Terrace,
where the fashionable cats pursue their scratching
occupation with such vigor.
Several lots of girls intend to try cottage life in
mountain districts this coming season of plum-
pudding, as a reproach to the hundreds of foolish
virgins who crowd the hotels at all the seaside
resorts. Last year the few men who did venture
into these establishments departed at the earliest
opportunity, and left several gross of girls con-
sidering the lovely sunsets in a bilious frame of
nnnd. Now the girls hope by a camp in the
mountains to do away with the necessity of mere
man.
The confusion occasioned by two families of the
one label getting and returning each other’s cor-
respondence at a swagger hotel nearly led to a
public fracas. All sorts of things are still being
threatened by the one and laughed at by the
other.

THE CROWNING CHARM
Of a pretty woman is—not hair, not eyes, not
features, not figure, but a good complexion. “Valaze”
is the great creator and preserver of good complexions.
It removes wrinkles, freckles, tan, blackheads, etc., and
substitutes a fair, soft, smooth skin that is the delight
of its fortunate possessor, and the charm of all beholders.
“ Valaze” is scientifically prepared from herbs grown in
the Carpathian Mountains. It is guaranteed to be non-
hair producing, bringing nothing but beauty in its train.

The good old gag about “ international,
complications” and “Imperial interests” serves
all manner of purposes. In Melbourne it has
been found necessary to put special restrictions on
Chinese factories because the Chow is so wily and
persistent a law-breaker that he crawls through
the regulations which are sufficient for the white
employer. Wherefore, W. H. Calder and Mel-
drum and Jacobs and George Reid’s brother and
Chinaman Ah Kett and Chinaman Pang recently
got together and resolved, among other things,
that anyattempt to make the blatant Chow obey
the law would “ cause embarrassment to our Im-
perial Government in its relations with friendly
powers, also that “ the proposed measure is one
of persecution, therefore contemptible in character
and quite unworthy of a place on the statute-book
of victoria.”
Here is an interesting extract from the
proceedings of the Victorian Upper House :
Mr. Melville suggested that Victorians should be
settled on the available lands of the Mallee. In the land
would be found the solution of all the difficulties that
beset the people. He dissented from giving strangers
free land. He trusted to the Victorian people first.
Mr. Rees : That’s only a parrot cry. Our own people
be sugared.
It is a pity there is not in Australia some power
strong enough to inform Rees that, since our own
people are so offensive to him, he will have 24
hours to get into a purer atmosphere outside the
Heads, and, failing his departure, no Australian
shall speak to him, eat or drink with him, buy or
sell with him, or in imy way offend his superiority
by contact with him. When we meet a very
superior hog who is shocked at the awful inferi-
ority of the globe, the only thing is to tell that
hog to go away and get a globe of his own.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The death of “Jack” Want is presented
as an additional cause for a.new batch of N.S.W.
Legislative Council appointments. Joey Car--
ruthers has now quite forgotten about the need for
Council reform.
Judge Hey don’s finding on the S.M.
Herald article re the coal-carriers’ dispute was
that the Herald, the organ of the employers, was
hostile to the aims of the N.S.W. Arbitration law,
whereas the Worker, the organ of the employed,
confined itself to legitimate criticism of the Act.
Bent’s Land Purchase Board struck the
usual land-tax evasion during a ramble through
Western Victoria the other day. Owner of one
estate asked £6O per acre for his land, and it is
valued for taxation purposes at 60s. This is the
class of man to whom the Argus always refers as
“the backbone of the country.”
Kennedy, Vic. M.H.R., compared the
closure successively to a policeman’s baton, a
double-edged sword, and a boomerang. “But,”
he added, “ I have no doubt it will be useful for
the purpose for which it was intended.” A
weapon like that seems likely to be useful in
any capacity except as a bulldog or an ironclad.
The Massey-Harris Co. of harvester
builders, which is yelling for a low Australian
tariff in the sacred name of British fair play, is a
Canadian concern, and Australian manufacturers
of agricultural implements cannot get within miles
of the Canadian markets, because Canada believes
in Canadian fair play, and has a tariff wall as high
as the Great Pyramid and just as thick.
“ Itan ” : Queensland public men and the
people generally only discuss Freetrade to express
their contempt for the fools and knaves who advo-
cate it. They had an experience of a Protective
Tariff, which encouraged the establishment of
many industries, since struck heavily by the
miserable revenue tariff of the Commonwealth.
If a vote were taken, Bananaland would poll
heavily for High Protection.
N.S.W. Joseph Carruthers was astonish-
ingly un-Joseph-like in reply to the Methodist
clerical deputation which wanted Sunday selling
made an offence by which a N.S.W. publican
might lose his license. Sunday selling might be
unlawful, but it wasn’t inherently sinful, he can-
didly informed a staggered lot of reverends. The
Cabinet had deliberately left this offence out of
its black list in the new Bill.
Johnson, M.H.R., the great obstruc-
tionist, has a motion on the business paper of
the Representatives that the House shall never
sit more than eight hours out of the 24. Johnson
has been clamoring a great deal of late about
“freedom of speech,” and his new desire to
prevent free speech, or any kind of speech,
except for about 32 hours in the week for about
half the year shows the versatility of J ohnson.
Both Sydney Telegraph and Herald be-
sought their present tin god, State Premier Car-
ruthers, to have a little common sense and shut
down the flood of talk on the N.S.W. estimates.
The only way Carruthers could do this was by using
the closure, and he used it freely. At the same
time, both papers were calling for vengeance on
Deakin for attempting to obtain the right to use
the closure. Only in Deakin’s case they called it
the “gag.”
N.S.W. Labor party, which is putting up
a record for stupidity in tactics this session, added
considerably to the record by its attempt to reduce
the higher-paid public servants by an all-round
percentage. This gave Carruthers a fine chance
to slap his chest and dare the House to interfere
with the Public Service Board’s assessment of
salaries. Clearly if, under normal conditions, the
public servants, after running the gauntlet of the
P.S.B. and its regulations, are to be grilled each
year by Parliament, security of tenure is reduced
to a farce.
The open and shameless hostility of the
Vic. House of Landlords to the Pure Food Bill
indicates that mighty lobbying has been going on,
on behalf of the associated poisoners of Melbourne.
Since the last election on the reduced franchise,
the House of Rich Landlords has been more or less
reasonable ; but the solid front presented to this
measure, and the big majority whose intention to
destroy it is already manifest, indicate that back-
stairs influence of the most strenuous sort has been
exerted.
Briner, M.L.A. (N.S.W.), has a proposal
before the Assembly that tolls should be estab-
lished on all bridges costing over £3OOO. As a
matter of loafing, lingering, and waste of human
effort the toll system is almost unrivalled. It is a
method whereby a full-grown man lounges all day
in one spot to collect about 95., of which he gets
perhaps 6s. in wages, the other 3s. going
to the State. Anyone who proposes to go back
to the toll system has the non-productive spirit
very badly.
Col. Ryrie, Deform candidate for Quean-
beyan (N.S.W.) says, amongst other things, that
he is strongly in favor of closer settlement. Con-
sidering the size of the Ryrie estate, what’s wrong
with him doing a bit in that direction on his own
account? Perhaps, though, State acquisition of
properties after they have been greatly enhanced
in value by the squandering of public money—said
acquisition to be at the owner’s valuation, plus
10 per cent. —is the kind of closer settlement that
the Colonel means.
A passing whiff from the remains of the
Vic. Butter Commission offended Melbourne’s
smelling apparatus the other day. William
Bateman petitioned Vic. Assembly to inquire-into
an alleged breach of contract by the Bent Govern-
ment, which, he said, had contracted to pay him
£1 Is. a day during the Commission’s sittings for
skirmishing up evidence as to the habits and
customs of butter-agents, &c. He has been paid
some £7O, but claims £250 or so, and Bent objects.
An interesting detail of the matter is that Bate-
man lives in Bent’s electorate. A whole lot of
people seem to live in Bent’s electorate.
ONLY ROOM FOR ONE.
An old Arab fable modernised for the benefit of Alfred Deakin in particular and
Australians in general.
The Victorian ’Pootra shook off his shroud
the other day and flapped—just after the proces-
sion had passed, as usual. No sooner had the
Federal stonewall collapsed, and an arrangement
been arrived at whereby some work would be
done, than old Ben Goddard, of Kyabram, wired
that he was calling a meeting of himself, Sammy
Lancaster, and one or two others, “to support
Opposition in opposing Deakin’s gag proposals.”
Poor old Goddard can’t grasp the fact that the
’Pootra is a long-since dead bird, and that if it
held 50 meetings it wouldn’t matter now.
N.S.W. Premier Carruthersis a bumptious
little insect. Being asked by Fegan, M.L.A.,
whether he would at once appeal to the High
Court supposing the Australian Government took
possession of the Dalgety site for a capital, Joey
cocked his solitary tail feather in the air and
replied :
The Federal Government will not be permitted to take
possession of any of this State’s territory without the
consent of the State Government. I cannot conceive it
to be possible that such an attempt will be made. Such
a contingency, should it unfortunately ever arise, can be
met by an exercise of the undoubted constitutional
powers of the State.
Unfortunately for Cocky Carruthers it is not he
but the High Court which is the judge of “the
undoubted constitutional powers of the State,”
and if the High Court decides against him, the
Australian Parliament will take possession whether
it has the consent of the Cocky Government or
not, and all the tail feathers in the world won’t
prevent it.
The Commonwealth doesn’t treat its ser-
vants very generously ; in some cases, it is posi-
tively unjust. The temporary employees in the
Customs Department, for instance, are refused
any annual holiday, and, if absent on sick leave,
are docked their pay. Further, when on sick
leave, they have to furnish weekly medical cer-
tificates, though it is not likely that a man who,
when on sick leave, is not on the salary list, would
malinger. In the same Department, there seems
a tendency to sacrifice efficiency to economy, old
and tried officers being replaced by cheap juvenile
clerks. That’s not the way to run a Department
which is of vital importance to the Common-
wealth.
There is much uncertainty in S. Australia
as to how Premier Price will deal with the immo-
vable ass that is braying in his path. The Tory
Council would get a considerable shock if he were
merely to adjourn for the ordinary Christmas
holidays, and resumed work on 2nd January.
There is no reason why Parliament should be
closed for the greater part of each year in the
interests of business men who are also amateur poli-
ticians, and who give the fag-end of their time to
the State. Anyway, as the Council has practically
rendered the session barren, it is absurd to close
merely because of ancient custom and ancient
fossildom. With an Upper House that won’t do
anything, the obvious remedy is to keep it sitting
till it does something.
According to careful measurements, made
by Webster, M.H.R., Joe Cook has done most
talking against the Deakin Ministry. Ai
“leader,” Joe felt it incumbent on him to rise
several times on every amendment in committee,
and state his opinion of the Labor party and the
Six Hatters. Result, 91yd. of Hansard. Reid
hasn’t been there very often, but whenever he has
come he has been noisy for a whole afternoon.
He is second, with 81yd. Williemotor Kelly has
left a dreary smell of petrol for GOyd. ; Conroy
has a modest 42yd., and Johnson is disgraced by
being only fifth with 36yd. Bets are offered as to
whether Kelly or Johnson will be the first to be
suppressed under the new Standing Orders. Some
offer a shade of odds on Kelly.
The same old lie, this time from Enabling,
M.L.C., of Victoria :
Englishmen, Irishmen, and Scotchmen were blocked at
the door, and it was useless, under such conditions, to
call for immigration.
Yet Embling cannot point to one Englishman,
Irishman, or Scotchman who has been refused
entrance to Australia. Subsequently Embling
stated that he was “ashamed of his country.”
That’s all right. His country is ashamed of him.
Embling, by the way, has never had a vote cast
in his favor. He induced his opponent to retire
when he was first elected, and since then he has
had the usual walk over. He is an awful bloated
commentary on the misrepresentation of Victoria
in Parliament.
Sydney Labor Council has sent a solemn
warning to England that this isn’t a place for
immigrants. In doing so it told something not
far from the truth. Australia isn’t much of a
place for immigrants; there is lack of work be-
cause of huge imports and want of land because of
huge monopolies. And where the disgrace comes
in is that Labor in N.S.W.. politics has for 13
years allowed its alleged policy of breaking up big
estates to provide land for settlement, to be a dead
letter, and while the fiscal question belonged to
the State legislature it voted most of the time
against work and against industries, and for the
rich Tory importer, and for the free and liberal
influx of the products of cheap sweated labor. In
big things the N.S.W. Labor Party has been a
horribly Tory and stagnant institution of late
years.
One of the unintended beauties of local
option was explained to the Victorian Tied Houses
Committee by a licensing inspector, who stated
that publicans who were making a bare £2OO a
year before the Cold Tea-ites closed 37 of North
Melbourne’s hotels are now making from £BOO to
£lOOO a year. But the licensee won’t have that
joy for long. Presently the landlord will look in,
and then the brewer, and between them Bung
will be squeezed as thin as ever. At present it is
simply to fatten the landlord and the brewer that
the people are taxed in order to provide compen-
sation for the dispossessed.
Now that Prime Minister Deakin shows
signs of being more awake than usual, it is to be
hoped that he has begun to realise that his scheme
for being beastly affable to Japan by altering the
Education Test is not the sort of thing that Aus-
tralia is inclined to stand. Deakin’s proposal was
to so fix the Act that any Asiatic might be
admitted if he could write his own language (and
he might also be admitted if he couldn’t write his
own language), and the great bulk of Australians
would sooner attend Deakin’s funeral (or even
stay away from his funeral) than make such a
sacrifice for the sake of affability.
Melbourne Argus, settling itself to
demonstrate that the agitation against the attempt
of the Yank Harvester Trust to smother the Vic.
industry is wasteful and ridiculous excess, quotes
figures to prove “ A Large Decrease, in Imports.”
The agricultural machinery imports in 1900 were)
valued at £283,218, those of 1904 were valued at
£578,301, the increase coming in four big jumps.
To justify its heading, however, the Argus seeks
to show that the imports for ’O5 may be only about
£400,000 worth. If these figures pan out correctly,
the difference in the two years’ transactions will
be due to the fact that the importers raced stock
into their stores last year in anticipation of. an
early tariff revision, but even then the satisfaction
of the Argus in noting the “large decrease” from
£283,218 to £400,000 (accepting its own figures
shows a splendid determination to overcome
figures and fight facts to the last.
A point invariably missed by Spruce Myth,
when explaining at women’s meetings the alleged
benevolence of the United States immigration
laws as compared with those of the Common-
wealth, is that every visitor passing through the
U.S. has to pay the head tax of two dollars,
which is imposed upon alien immigrants remaining
in the country—or the steamship co. pays it for
him and adds it to his fare, which is the same
thing. True, the law says the tax shall not be
levied on aliens in transit, but the Supreme Court
has decided that the possession of a ticket to a
European port is not sufficient evidence of transit,
as the traveller may sell the ticket and remain in
the country, thus defrauding Uncle Sam of two
dollars. So the alien can’t prove he is in transit
without going away, and when he is gone he can’t
recover his two dollars, consequently Uncle Sam
cheerfully collects two dollars.
“ H.G-.” offers a most valuable suggestion:
The Swiss system of regulating Parliamentary speeches
might well be adopted by the Australian Parliament.
This is not a party question, for Webster, on the one side,
is as great a nuisance as Johnson on the both
sides would find business expedited were there some
means of curtailing the wild waste of words. Unlike
“gag” measures of closing debate, the Swiss system
opens no door to abuse. It divides up the numbers of
hours in the period that the session is intended to
last by the number of members, giving each man
the right to speak for double the quotient. This
offers every chance for one side or the other to put
up a man to talk against time when tactical exigencies
demand that course, and puts no curb on any debate
of an important character. Every man knows exactly
how much time he has available and utilises it to the best
advantage. Of course, were every member to avail him-
self fully of the time allotted, the session would last twice
as long as intended. But in practice this does not occur
in Switzerland, though it might in Australia. Under
present Australian conditions, one member may start
talking when Parliament meets, and never sit down
throughout the entire session ; though even Neild has
never done quite so much as that. If the Swiss system
were adopted in Australia it would be a beautiful thing to
see Johnson and Kelly, having used up all their time
allowance in the first half of the session, sitting silent and
bursting with rage for the last three months, and not
allowed even to interject.
The story of the closure :
The Opposition party of the Australian Parliament is a
very sick party just now. It has been out-manoeuvred
and soundly thrashed, and has been taught not only
that it is a minority, but a very foolish minority at that.
When G. 11. Reid definitely gave up the pretence of being
Opposition leader, and resolved to dally in Sydney
to pick up what crumbs he could in the Divorce Court
and at the Quarter Sessions, the captainship of the
disgruntled Sydney party fell to Joseph Cook, who set
himself to the task of opposing with a bitter and un-
scrupulous pertinacity. The system of opposition—from
the point of view of the man who didn’t care what hap-
pened to Australia so long as his miserable little party
interests were served —was good. Joseph Cook and his
followers seldom actually stonewalled, but they ob-
structed all the time. They “moved the adjourn-
ment” just enough times to waste as much
of the session as could be wasted in that way
without making the game too obvious. For every
Bill they had a long debate; for every clause in
committee several amendments and seventy speeches.
It was an elusive guerilla system of war, infinitely
harassing, and as effective in preventing progress as
the Boer tactics in the second stage of the S’African war.
Through broken country the column of the Govern-
ment attempted to move, whilst an enemy, inferior
in numbers, refusing always to give direct battle, held
the hills and made a dozen small attacks a day.
Progress was practically impossible. Finally the Cabinet’s
patience was exhausted. It began to understand the
game which was being played for the purpose of securing
a barren session, and made up its mind to make a resolute
stand. It was only necessary for that resolution to be
arrived at to be successful. The Opposition was not only
inferior in numbers but markedly inferior in generalship
and ability. It was very easily decoyed into coming
down on to the plains and offering onen battle
in the shape of a “stonewall.” Then the Government
remarked as Cromwell did at Dunbar, “ The Lord hath
delivered them into our hands,” and the fight opened.
As a result the guerilla bands were utterly routed and lose
all their armory to the Government, which now has Stand-
ing Orders which can effectively suppress any further
attempts at obstruction. The victory having been won,
what is important now is that full advantage should be
taken of it for the benefit of the Commonwealth. The
Government party, flushed with victory, is keen for work.
The electors are sitting up in glad astonishment at finding
an iron hand beneath the soft affable glove of Deakin.
The time is fitting for doing something big.
AUSTRALIA AND THE CHOW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Australia is getting a bad name through this sort of
legislation. It will be asked everywhere, What did you
do to the poor Chinaman?— Melville, M.L.C., in the
Opium Bill debate. (Melville was the Minister of Defence
who despatched the first Victorian Cohentingent to
S’Africa.)
“ What did you do to the Chinaman ?
What did you do to the Chow ?
You shut the door
In his face and swore
That he’d smoke no more
From now,
You made him keep the Factories Act
By a brutal shameless plan ;.
Wherever you go
You’ll find they know
What you did to the Chinaman."
. “ What did I do to the Chinaman ?
I think that you’ll allow
That I fought a war
And I spilt some gore,”
Said Melville, “ for
The Chow.
Just look to the mines where the reeking cat
His dorsal muscles fan ;
And judge by the tracks
Of his blood-stained axe
What I did for the Chinaman.”

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The N.S.W. Pioneer Motor Cycle Club held a
80-mile road spin on Saturday last, and the result
was to demonstrate very forcibly the superiority of
the Australian-made machine for the sort of roads
we have. Mr. Norman Saunders, the winner, rode
a machine of his own design and construction, and
whieh he calls a “Rival.” Although he finished
the last mile on a punctured tyre, Mr. Saunders got over
the 30 miles in 56min. 30sec., and, considering the dusty,
evil road, all full of ruts and holes, and sprinkled over
with sharp jagged metal, or something else that cut tyres
like knives, the performance was remarkable. The second
place was filled by J. Jarman, who rode his own design of
local manufacture. Hardly a machine got through with-
out damage to the tyres, and there is a suspicion that
somebody along that road doesn’t want motor-bike races
held in the district.
The motor was not altogether an imported
luxury in Australia. Long ago, when the old world was
beginning to experiment with the idea, Australians were
doing something in the same line. As far back as 1893
Knight Eaton, a Brisbane man in the cycle trade, made a
motor for driving bicycles. He fixed it right behind the
back wheel, and the thing was not quite a success —no
first effort is—although it drove the bicycle all right. In
all probability Mr. Eaton threw away a fortune by not
following up his very successful first attempt. Then in
1898 Mr. Thomson, of Armadale, near Melbourne, built a
car, driven by a kerosene engine of his own invention. It
ran some 2000 miles very successfully in Victoria. In
1900 he brought it to Sydney, and exhibited it
at the Agricultural Show, and in April of the same year
it started from Bathurst to Melbourne, and accomplished
the pioneer overland trip in 10 days. The distance was
493 miles, and the pioneers struck bad weather, and found
out that even then the roads of N.S. Wales were un-
speakable, while Victoria had no roads at all, and the
traffic followed the course of the Government quagmires.
The average speed for the whole trip was 8'72 miles per
running hour, and the actual running ranged from five to
40 miles an hour, according to the state of the roads and
the slope of the country. In fact, motor-building might
almost call itself one of our natural industries—but it
won’t grow without a 50 per cent, tariff all the same.
The Dunlop Reliability Test is still at time of
writing undecided. The run to Medlow and back eliminated
only one car, Fauvel’s Richard-Brasier ; while, owing to
the driver accidentally touching the sparking appara-
tus, Tarrant’s engine stopped, and the Australian car
lost three points by sheer bad luck which in no way
affected its reliability. On Thursday morning the six that
remained in, started another run-off, this time back to
Melbourne. The first stage to Goulburn was to be a non-
stop run and all the competitors made full points, although
Moffatt had a blow-out close to the town and finished,
without stopping, on the deflated tyre. Day’s De Dion
smashed a spring, but managed to score full points with-
out effecting any repairs. The second stretch from Goul-
burn to Gundagai included a stretch of bad road that
began to find out the weak spots. Even the invincible
Mercedes nearly came to grief in a V-shaped water course,
dislocating a spring. But Hobbs dashed on without
effecting repairs. Moffatt struck the same hole, and
smashed his wheel, both driver and observer being hurled
out and badly shaken up. Hobbs was the only one to
score full points. Moffatt, of course, was out of it; Day
lost two points, Grimwade, Tarrant, and Wilkinson lost
three points each. When they arrived at Albury Day had
broken another spring, but got in within' schedule
time, and Wilkinson lost another three points through
exceeding the time allowed for adjustment at the start.
At Albury, with a view to eliminating a few more, the
conditions were made more strenuous, and the run to the
Victorian capital, over roads that are in fact not roads,
was ordered to be covered under non-stop conditions.
The five surviving cars banged and rattled from Albury
to Melbourne, stopping only at closed railway-gates, and
all arrived within schedule time and without losing the
10 points which would put them out of the competition.
Sydney Day ran through with both the front springs of
his car broken and held in position with string.
Also, a steering handle was bent so that he could
only turn to the left; when he wanted to go to the
right he had to keep on turning to the left till he
arrived at the right position. The position at present is
—Hobbs and his Mercedes have not lost a single point the
whole trip : Day and his De Dion lost two ; Tarrant and
the Tarrant car, three ; Grimwade and the Argyll, six ;
Wilkinson and the Talbot, nine. The best solution now
seems to be something with dice and a basin. To run it
off means running till the cars are worn out and drop to
pieces through old age.
V * *
Twenty-six of the 30 cars that started used the
British Imperial Oil Co.’s petrol. 8.1.0. Co. is the old
Shell Transport Co. which keeps the flag flying in spite of
the unscrupulous Standard Oil Trust. Further, of the
seven which were left in for the further test to Medlow
Bath and back, to decide the destination of the Dunlop
Cup, five used the 8.1.0. Co. liquid. And when the com-
petitors arrived at the Agricultural Ground it was the
same co. which lubricated the throats of the competitors
with whisky, and put a genial glow into them with cigars,
and other luxuries.
“Usay”: Cyclists have different ways of hin-
dering the flight of their wheels downhill, and each
reckons his the one infallible device ; but there is a
decline in the mountainous district near Adelaide that
would baffle the ingenuity of the most resourceful. I
don’t know the official estimate of the fall, but when I
ambled down it seemed like lin I£. This road runs at
right angles into another, and at the junction is a pub.
My speed was too great to allow of turning off, so I
dashed through the front door of the pub. and down the
passage till I came in contact with the back wall. It was
a case of an irresistible force meeting a (hitherto) immov-
able object, and the latter lost its reputation, and fell
with me into the valley below. There a policeman and a
publican sought me earnestly, but missed me amidst the
falling plaster, and in the twilight I escaped to‘ the Holy
City disguised in whitewash. I write this under fear of
the “ accursed walls of quod,” and if apprehended must
plead “ act of God,” or something.
Don Walker, the Victorian cyclist, who an-
nounced his “ definite” retirement from the track at the
close of Sydney Wheel Race carnival, has a unique record
in some respects. He has competed in 15 Austral Wheel
Races in 16 years, and raked in as prize money, in round
figures, £3OO0 —equal to £lB7 per annum, or, roughly,
£3 10s. per week. And all for merely whirling his Hind
feet.

“ Unregistered ” cycling is flourishing in Vic-
toria, apparently ; as it held one meeting Saturday week
and has announced another, lasting two days, on Exhibi-
tion Oval, no less. There must be something very rotten
about either the Victorian League or the Victorian riders
to make such a thing possible.
* * * *
S. A. Automobile Club has 83 members, and its
first meet brought out 30 cars and 16 motor cycles—
estimated value about £ll,OOO. Visitors to Adelaide say
that motors are a commoner sight in the city streets than
they are in Melbourne.
* * * *
Whenever a sportsman goes abroad he is ex-
pected to be a model of “ quiet modesty,” or, at any rate,
this writer never heard of a champion' returning to his
ain countree, but someone rose up and assured the great
organs of public opinion that the champion had won tons
of friends by his “ quiet, modest ways.” Kieran is the
latest to have scored with the q.m.w., according' to
trainer Mitchell, although, certainly, Mitchell did qualify
it by stating that he only practised that demeanor “ out
of the water.” It is a very weary old gag, and merely
means that the champion did not rage round in mufti
and greet his friends with loud howls at the dinner-table,
and, in general, behaved more like an intelligent human
being than a combination of Kaiser Bill and trained
chimpanzee.
The angriest set of athletes in Australia just
now is the East Sydney Swimming Club. North Sydney
Swimming Club, has the honor of being the body to which
Barney Kieran belongs. The East Sydney Club held its
opening carnival on Saturday, at which the chief event
was the 300 yd. Championship of N.S.W. North Sydney
Club entered Kieran for this event, whereat the East
Sydney was delighted. But the Northern Club
had already extracted a promise from Kieran that
he would make his first appearance in N.S.W. after
his return home at the North Sydney Welcome
Home Carnival. East Sydney got into communication
with Kieran, however, and went for North Sydney with
vigor, and some remarkably plain speaking was in-
dulged in. When the meeting came off on Saturday,
Kieran did not compete. Now North Sydney has got its
Panama right down over its eyes, and is brooding on
reven e. Probably, it will take the shape of a boycott
of North Sydney by the members of East Sydney.
Many of the crack swimmers belong to the Eastern crowd,
and North Sydney carnivals will be dull affairs if
East Sydney swimmers decline to compete. Even Barney
Kieran himself cannot make a whole carnival. In spite of
Kieran’s absence East Sydney had a most interesting
meeting. The 300 yd. championship saw some good racing.
Nine started, and Craig, of Balmain, and Murray, of
Manly, went to the front early. At the finish Smith, of
the Enterprise Club, made a mighty effort, but Craig was
too speedy, and the Enterprise man, in spite of his great
sprint, had to be content with second place. The time
was 3min. 51 sec. The 100 yd. Club Championship found
Cecil Healey in front at the finish, but that speedy young
man had not got near his own world’s record for the
distance, which he covered in 59 2-ssec.
* * * «
Fryberg, the Maoriland representative in the
coming swimming championships meeting, is not likely
to defeat Kieran, Healey and co. He is onty a lad, but
turns the scale at 13st., and is altogether too beefy for a
champion swimmer.
Now that Kieran has hoisted the Australian
tail in the swimming world by beating Enirland’s best in
their own baths, it is probable that an attempt will be
made to send some of our crack runners abroad. With
Duffey, the American, retired after being beaten by Nigel
Barker, of N.S.W., and Shrubb gone the way of most
amateurs who develope boodleosis, there seems to be
room for some new champions, and this country has a
few of the best on deck just now. So probably Nigel
Barker and Wheatley, of Victoria, will be sent to the
English championships meeting next year.
* * * *
The test races which were held for the purpose
of deciding who should represent N.S.W. at the Swimming
Championships meeting at Brisbane, were held in Sydney
on Monday night. The main result was to show the over-
whelming strength of East Sydney Club. In the 100 yd.
three of the four triers C. Healey, Tartakover and
Wickham, belonged to E.S., and Len Murray, the fourth,
to Manly. Tartakover was right out of it, and Healey
and Wickham downed Murray in a great rush at the
finish. The half-mile found R. Healey, A. Hill, and R.
Garland of E.S. competing with R. R. Craig of Balmain.
Hill dropped out at 250 yd. and one after another all the
others save Craig and Healey. Healey beat Craig by full
30yd. North Sydney Club is sending Kieran to Brisbane
at its own expense.

Anything in England must for the ordinary
Brown and Robinson be a most exciting and profitable
sport. For a recent great fishing competition in the
Thames 1500 anglers turned up from all parts of the
country, and of these 1100 were allotted “swims.” The
“bag of assorted fish” which took first prize weighed
31b. 9oz. !

The “Jarsay” meeting at Randwick (Sydney)
last week was not altogether a dream of glory. The
Hurdle Race saw Paragon and South Head come down,
and jockey Montgomery had his collarbone broken and
bits knocked off his countenance—all in honor of Lord
Jarsay. Maoriland mare Levant ran so badly that the
Stewards started to hold an inquiry, and adjourned till a
vet. should make a report—all in honor of Lord Jarsay.
It was a day of rejoicing to the bookmakers, outsiders
and surprise packets getting home in every case. The
only fly in Ikey’s ointment was that the crowd of mugs
was so small, and the profits, although at a good rate per
cent., were hardly bulky enough to justify a champagne
supper—in honor of Lord Jarsay.
* * * *
The Auckland Racing Club is up against the
bookmaking' trouble in an acute and startling form.
During a recent meeting an exceedingly well-dressed lady
was seen flitting about the grandstand talking to mem-
bers of her own sex and collecting much coin. Gradually
it dawned on the stewards that the lady was “laying
’em,” and “steps were taken.” Nothing happened, as
whenever the officials approached her, the lady simply
disappeared—sat down amidst an ocean of chiffon and
was lost to sight. The club vows that it will block her
at the next day’s racing.

Gr. G. Stead’s handsome bay colt Sungod, the
son of Multiform, who ran second to Noctuiform in the
last A.J.C. Derby and helped to increase his owner’s
swag by winning the New and Grantham Stakes, is no
more. He was destroyed as the result of an accident
while exercising.

Australia, seemingly, has no charms for Frank
Bullock, the jockey, who returned from England in time
to win the Melbourne Cup on . Blue Spec. He is going
back for good business reasons. Reckons that he can
make £lOOO a year in the Cold Country by his fees for
losing mounts, apart from the rewards for riding winners.
Juanita, winner of the principal race at Albion
Park (Q.), on last holiday, paid 72 to lon the tote. Ikey
and Co. offered 10 to 1, and assert the machine “ish no
goot.”

“Vulcan ” : Winning a “ Tatt.’s ” gamble isn’t
all morning sore-head. Day or two after publication of a
recent big prize-winner’s name and address, the unfortu-
nate’s front step wore down three inches in five hours.
Callers had everything from a 200-roomed house down
to twins for disposal. A perspiring and despair-
ing postman deposed to delivering no less than 64,296
letters in three days ; the contents ranging from a
diffident request for a loan of 3d. to complete a flying
machine, to a frank plea for a modest thousand to allow a
tired person to rest chronically. The victim defended
himself for a week, then broke down, let his furnished
house to the first bidder, and evaporated.

Wren, the Collingwood (Vic.) tote man, having
abandoned the scheme for purchasing Bundoora Park at
Eltham, has leased the Ascot, Fitzroy and Richmond
racing grounds from the previous lessee, “Ben ” Nathan.
Wren declares he will have no stake of less than £3O
(present prizes are £lO and £8), and £5O and £lOO flutters
will be quite common. At Christmas time he proposes
to go in heavily, and one prize of £5OO will be run for at
Ascot. By these inducements he reckons to take a lot of
the horses away from the V.R.C. places. Also he says he
is going to make the unregistered sport clean. How he
is going to do it has not yet been explained. If the whole
pony business were boiled it wouldn’t come out white,
though it might be a paler brown than it is now.

Miss Chalmers, of Palmerston, Maoriland’s
champion horsewoman, at the recent Palmerston show
took first, second and third prizes in the jumping compe-
titions. She ended up, riding one horse and leading the
other three, by taking four horses over the sticks to-
gether.
“U.”: Some of the tales lately floating around
about outrages committed or threatened by betting-club
assistants are mere inventions, told to help along some
fishy yarn. For instance, young Blanksby, a counter-
jumping resident of my boarding-house, was given a few
shillings by some of the girl-boarders, and asked to back
Blue Spec on the tote for them. He arrived home on
' Cup nig'h't greatly excited, and asserted that he had put
the money on, but had been swindled out of money and
tickets by the tote clerks when the result was known,
and threatened with personal violence and the loss of most
of his interior anatomy if he didn’t go without saying
much more. Blanksby asserted that he had remained on
the tote premises all the afternoon, until he was actually
thrown out. His tale was going nicely, and the girls were
sympathising, when Smith came in, and asked, “How
did you get on out at the course, Gus'? Didn’t look
as if you were doing' too well when I saw you.”
“ Couldn’t have been me you saw,” said poor Blanksby ;
“I’ve been at the tote all the afternoon.” “Go on!”
said Smith; “as if I could mistake that ugly cbiv of
yours. Once seen, never forg'otten ! ” Blanksby tried
hard to convince his audience that his tote yarn was not
a fake, but the suspicious frowns of the girls meet him
now wherever he turns, and he is thinking seriously of
changing his abode. '

Clarence Weber has arranged the wrestling
match with Buttan Singh, for which he has been yearning
since they met at Fitzgeralds’ Circus building (Melb.)
some months ago. The white man on that occasion
scored one fall by cross-buttocking the Hindu, but was
debited with a couple of unsatisfactory falls whilst both
men were rolling on the mat. This time the bout will be
under the management of the lately-formed Olympic
Club, at the same Circus building as before. The club
will fix up a full programme of athletic contests and
“ turns,” with the Buttan-Weber match as principal item.
They wrestle catch-as-can, best two out of three, or one
fall to win if neither man can score another.

The Olympic Games, which are due again next
year, will be held at Athens —a small place in Greece,
where people are named Demetrius. What remains of
the ancient city is to be illuminated. Leonidas
Phriedphish will be in his glory once more, and will, no
doubt, take down the stranger even as his forefathers did
in the remote days when they were described as a people
“ruddy, fair, and exceeding fickle.” The pick of the
world’s athletes will be there, and it is understood some
Australians may go. Certainly, some of the Australian
spielers who have been kicked off the continent will be
there, and probably make a few thousand by selling the
Acropolis to some unsuspecting foreigner, after explain-
ing to him that they were driven out of Australia by the
trend of Socialistic legislation, and that the Labor party
had killed private enterprise.

Although the Maoriland football team is purely
amateur, English papers state that overtures have been
made to many of the “shiniest” members to turn pro-
fessional and accept lucrative fees to remain in the Cold
Country. In fact, it is stated that some of the Maori-
landers have partly accepted the terms offered. The
press generally has gone mad on the play of the beefy
Islanders, and unless the heads of players are kept within
reasonable limits, the. hats which they wore when they
left Maoriland won’t even fit the' team’s baby brother
(whose head is swelling by proxy) when they return.
* * * *
The cursed gambling spirit again:—“During
the recent Anglican Convention in Melbourne, presided
over by the Archbishop, the voting for two candidates
for a vacant canonry was equal, and the scrutineers were
directed to decide the matter by lot —which was done
with due solemnity.” — S.M. Herald. Come to think of
it, there is not much difference between the drawing of
lots for a canonry and the tossing of pennies for coin.
The second Golden Gate (Sydney) handicap
last week wasn’t much improvement on the first as
•regards the good behaviour of the athletes. Three non-
triers were disqualified on the opening night—although
there were many cases which missed the eyes of the care-
ful stewards. There is evidently a host of runners who
are striving to suppress the sport ; but the management
has decided that no quarter will be given to these
stranglers. The meeting was even better patron-
ised by the public than the initial handicap, and profes-
sional athletics look healthy at present.

The English Amateur Athletic Association has
biffed Alfred Shrubb, the eighth wonder of the globe,
right out of the amateur section ; and with the zest that
comes of a world-shaking action is eagerly inquiring into
the practices of quite a lot of top-notchers. In g-eneral,
the trouble seems to be that many amateurs have found
out some occult way of making money at the game and
partaking of the flesh-pots of professionalism, while yet
wearing the unsullied robe of amateurism, which qualified
them to mix with the best.
As an all-round athlete young F. Boynton, son
of storekeeper Boynton, of Balranald (N.S.W.), should be
hard to beat. He has been at Melbourne Wesley College
for some years, and now he is captain of the football team,
cricket team and rowing eight, and is a fine runner and
athlete generally. He commenced the present cricket
season with top score (70) in a match which his college
won easily from St. Xavier’s.

Sydney Yacht Squadron held an ocean race on
Saturday, the event being the annual run for the
Beauchamp Cup, which must be won three times to be
included in the family plate. Seven yachts started on a
strong flood tide for the rounding mark off Coogee. Petrel
led and Scotia br ught up the rear. Petrel fell off in the
light wind, and Fleetwing was the first to burst into the
ocean. Scotia was becalmed under Steel Point, and then
a big ocean liner put her out of her course, and the book-
makers reckoned her name was mud and offered “ fearful
odds,” like those that Macaulay faced in his “Lays of
Ancient Rome.” Fleetwing led round the mark, and
Scotia was far in the rear ; it got too close to the reef and
had to make a board out to sea to get round the mark.
On the return home the breeze freshened up, and Scotia
began to move through the water in splendid style and
made up a lot of lost time. Oithona was the rst boat to
enter the Heads, followed by Magic and Fleetwing, and
in that order they finished. When the rating adjust-
ments had been completed it was found that Scotia had
beaten all the others, and that Fleetwing was next, lmin.
ssec. behind, with Culwuila third. Then some gentlemen
who had laid fearful odds wished they could walk on
the water and sprint ashore. It is a horrible thing to lay
the odds on a steamer unless the booky can swim. This
was Mr. Bremner’s second win of the cup with the Scotia.
* * * *
Sydney Flying Squadron held two heats and a
final on Port Jackson on Saturday, and as a spectacle they
were picturesque, the display of kites being very fine.
But as a sport—well, the less said the better.
‘ ‘ Swab ” : The latest novelty in American row-
ing is the “ octopede ” boat—a sculling eight. An octo-
pede would naturally be faster than an eight-oared row-
ing boat, but the crew would need to be more accom-
plished watermen to sit the boat properly and get the
most out of it. In Australia, where rowing is largely
carried on in inlets subject to the sudden rise of choppy
seas, the octopede, like all long boats, is not likely to be
popular. An octopede on Sydney harbor, for instance,
would be likely to snap in two the first time the bows got
on one wave and the stern on another. Still sculling 4 is
essentially a better sport than rowing-, where much power
is lost by the muscles on one side of the body being put
to insufficient use ; and the octopede may take the place
of the old racing eight in a few years.

In Sydney first-grade cricket premiership com-
petition Burwood is now at the head of the list with
seven competition points ; Waverley comes second with
four, and North Sydney, Central Cumberland and Glebe
are bunched together with three each to their credit.
North Sydney feels its position very keenly.
* * *’ *
In Sydney first-grade cricket on Saturday, the
chief atrocity was the walloping of North Sydney by its
late limb, Gordon, which beat it by 51 runs on : the first
innings. Said that the Gordon men almost wept at
having to beat the “mother club”; but they set their
teeth with Roman fortitude and did it with all their
might. It was North Sydney’s first defeat in two years.
Although Saturday was a perfect afternoon there was a
lot of most indifferent batting, which was only thrown
into greater relief by the three centuries. Diamond,
playing for Burwood against University, knocked up 122;
Brownlow, of Middle Harbor, made 103 against Pad-
dington ; and when Paddington got to the sticks, the
only Victor Trumper scored 101 before he was caught.
Wicket-keeper Kelly’s retirement from Aus-
tralian representative cricket is likely to be helped by the
proceeds of a benefit match between the Australian XI.
which lost the ashes and a N.S.W. team, in Sydney in
January. And the match won’t be a very unequal one
after all. The idea, however, opens another aspect to
Australian cricket. Years ago, when a benefit was pro-
posed for George Giffen, the outcry was loud and long that
it meant the thin end of the wedge of professionalism in
cricket ; but the recent lucrative visits of Australian
teams to England have fastened the title on Australia
permanently, and players seemingly don’t care what they
are called as long as the money rolls in. The battering
which Kelly has put up with for many years deserves a
benefit.
* * * *
The unreliable wicket-keeping of Newland for
S. A. against Victoria has brought about his elimination
from the team which is to play N.S.W. Although 19
players have been chosen to practise, the only alteration
likely to take place will be the installation of Gehrs in
Newland’s place. Gehrs’ work in the tail-end of the Aus-
tralian XI. tour has caused him to be considered as the
“ stumper ” of the Australian team ; but everything
depends on how he shapes in the season’s Sheffield Shield
matches.
* * * *
If the tour of the Australian XI. wasn’t very
lucrative from the standpoint of Captain Darling and his
men, it panned out very well for other people. For all
matches, over £lO,OOO was whacked by the counties ;
while the gates of the tests yielded over £ll,OOO, of which
the Australians took £5635.
* * * *
The quiet omission of Bill Howell’s name from
the list of probables for inter-State cricket is taken to
mean that Bill has retired from the game. S.M. Herald,
instead of accepting the situation, devoted half-a-column
of its best page to the “sensational” dropping of Bill,
and darkly hinted that Bill would be heard from. But,
up to date, Bill hasn’t been heard from.
* * * *
A fairly strong team of Sydney bowlers was com-
fortably beaten in Adelaide last week, twice by S.A., and
once by the Adelaide Club alone. Local players average
considerably younger than the Sydney men.
* * * *
There seem to be quite a crowd of resurrections
in the U.S. A. lately. Griffo has been coming to life again,
till he has become recognised as a habit or a vice. Johel
Sullivan is anxious to get knocked out by somoone in the
first flight, but, so far, no one has been unkind enough to
take advantage of his bow-window front. The latest
resurrection is that of Terry McGovern, erstwhile known
as The Terrible.
* * * *
Judging by his exhibition against Charles Frost
at Sydney National Sporting Club last week, his recent
sojourn in wet, windy Wellington (M.L.) has improved
the stamina of Hock Keys wonderfully. Frost started
with a tremendous burst of stoush, and for a minute or
so it looked as though Keys had been caught napping.
The blows fell so fast that it was impossible to see them,
so the cognoscenti placed their elbows on their knees,
closed their eyes and listened intently. They knew that
those blows which gave forth a hollow, brass-drum sound
were falling on Keys’ stomach ; others, which gave forth a
dull, meaty thud, were striking his upper chest; while
the sharp wooden-like cracks were head blows.
Then Keys lashed out with a left and right through the
hurricane at where Frost’s head ought to be, and
found it. Frost staggered back on to the ropes.
Keys did the hurricane act, and Frost slipped down
to the floor. But he got up again, and raged round Keys
like a mad bull till the gong went. That was the first
round ; afterwards they went slower, but fast enough to
hurt. Hock’s skill enabled him to land two blows for
every one he received, but he still, as he always did, lacks
hitting power. He bashed Frost three times running on
the jaw, and instead of curling up on the floor Frost
landed him over the kidneys. Twice Keys narrowly
escaped being knocked out, but he continued to hit Frost
in vital spots with great precision and artistic effect. In
the sixth, after body exchanges, Keys smote Frost on the
mouth four times in succession just as the bell rang, and
Frost sat down looking decidedly weary. A moment later
the towel fluttered into the centre of the ring, and the
referee, in giving Keys the verdict, announced that Frost
had damaged one of his hands badly. Keys is a beautiful
boxer, but has not got the steam for a raw meat scrap.
After the Closure rumpus in the House of
Reps, the spontaneous handshake of the Premier
and Joe Cook was another instance of the
irrepressibility of the former’s good feeling.
Deakin’s benignity is always on top. The majority
of members, however, cannot manage to be benign
without the assistance of D.C.L. whisky to remind
them that sweet reasonableness is the best policy
even in Parliamentary debate. A man animated
by the spirit of D.C.L. is wise in all things.*
Queensland Assembly shook itself up a
little last week when Lesina, M.L.A., called
Minister Bell “an English cad,” and Bell called
Lesina, “you great brute.” There was no
bloodshed.
Randolph Bedford’s latest novel, “The
Sn ire of Strength,” published in London by
Heinemann, will be issued in America by Herbert
B. Turner & Co., of Boston, early in February.
Last week death removed Mrs. Frederick
Lord Cloye—in years and residence Melbourne’s
oldest inhabitant. She arrived in 1840, and was
93 years old when she died. Her husband was
one of the first solicitors admitted by the eccentric
Justice Willis, then Resident Judge at Port
Phillip (1841).
Horse-racing, as a rule, is in sore need of
purification. Its morals want washing. But
those members of the V.R.C. who visit Daly’s
new Turkish Baths in the Royal Arcade, Mel-
bourne, have at least a love of external cleanliness
which must assuredly permeate to their inner con-
sciences. After a healthful two or three hours at
Daly’s Turkish Baths, a man feels good. The
improvement in his body has brought virtue to
his' mind.
The punt tragedy, which Melbourne papers
magnified into a national disaster last Cup Day,
was inquired into by Coroner Cole last week.
Thirty witnesses faced the starter. Fifteen said
that the punt was rocked till it tipped over, and
fifteen said it just sank. The Coroner gave
his casting vote with the rockers, and committed
for trial, on a charge of manslaughter, two young
men who were alleged to have done most of the
rocking.
“Itan”: Arthur Morgan has set an ex-
ample to other State Premiers in the way he has
made out a case for the'sugar industry and placed
Bananaland’s claims before the Australian Parlia-
ment. If Barrenjoey or Bent had to handle such
an affair they would start off by screeching
“Secesh.” But Morgan possesses a little
diplomacy and has worked the matter quietly.
He just acts. The swinging about of open gamp®
should be left to old women and cranks and Bent-
and Joe Platitude.

PROSPECTUS
. . OF THE . .
Queensland flcciden!#feneral Insurance §®.
LIMITED:
To be incorporated under the “ Companies Acts 1863 to 1896,” whereby the liability of a Shareholder is
limited to the amount of his Shares.
NOMINAL CAPITAL = - £lOO,OOO.
Divided into 100,000 Shares of £1 each.
A first issue of 50,000 Contributing Shares is now offered to the public for subscription, payable 2s. fid.
on application, 2s. fid. on allotment, and five payments of Is. per share at intervals of not less
than one calendar month, so as to provide a Paid-up Capital of £25,000.
PROVISIONAL DIRECTORS :
Sir ALFRED S. COWLEY, Kt.
Hon. T. B. CRIBB (Messrs. Cribb & Foote).
Hon. P. MURPHY, M.L.C.
ACHESON OVEREND, Esq. (Queensland Milling Co., Ltd.).
SOLICITORS :
Messrs. O’SHEA & O’SHEA.
BANKERS :
THE QUEENSLAND NATIONAL BANK LIMITED
AGENTS:
HOLMES & CHURCH, Creek Street, Brisbane.
As an illustration of the success of some of the Companies doing this class of business, the follow-
ing table clearly shows that the business is a profitable one :
tThis Company commenced business with a paid-up Capital of £25,000, has paid several dividends, the last being-
-10 per cent. ;in addition they have capitalised some of their profits. The paid-up Capital now is £62,500.
* This Company did a successful business, and after paying several dividends up to 8 per cent, was purchased by
the Manchester Insurance Co., the shareholders receiving a liquidation dividend of 9s. Od. per share.
In the event of the Company not being floated, the application money will be returned in full.
No promotion money or consideration of any kind will be paid or given, nor will any Preferential
Shares be issued. The only charges against the Company will be brokerage at the rate of 2J per
centum on such of the Shares as are subscribed for through members of the Stock Exchanges in the
different States, and the usual charges, including advertising, printing and stationery, and the necessary
legal charges incidental to formation and registration of the Company.
The Shares will be, as far as possible, distributed so as to secure Shareholders throughout the
State with desirable business.
The only agreement that the Provisional Directors have entered into is that the business of the
Company shall be managed by Messieurs Holmes and Church, General Insurance Agents, Creek
Street, Brisbane, on the terms mentioned in the said agreement. Messieurs Holmes and Church’s
long connection with General Insurance Business is a sufficient guarantee that the business of the
Company will be well conducted, both in the interests of the insuring public and the Shareholders.
As it is desirous of starting business as soon as possible, owing to the Workers’ Compensation
Act probably becoming Law at an early date, intending subscribers should make early application for
Shares.
The draft Memorandum and Articles of Association have been prepared, and can be inspected by
intending Shareholders at the offices of the Company’s Solicitors.
Moneys accompanying application for Shares must be by cheque crossed to the credit of The
Queensland Accident and General Insurance Company Limited.
Prospectus and forms of application for Shares may be obtained from the brokers of the Stock
Exchanges in the States, or from Messrs. Holmes and Church, Creek-street, Brisbane, to whom
applications for Shares must be sent.
The Provisional Directors are empowered to register the Company when 20,000 Shares have been
applied for.
It is proposed to establish this Company for the purpose of
(a) Providing a Queensland Insurance Company, with Local Boards of Advice.
(b) To transact General Accident, Employers’ Liability, and Workers’ Compensation business, also to
provide compensation in case, of sickness, and to indemnify Employers against loss by want of
honesty of Employees.
• f 6 ?P erat i° ns the Company will be, if found advisable, extended to the other States, and in
inew of the fact that Workers’ Compensation Acts are in force in Western Australia, South Australia,
New Zealand, and shortly to be so in Queensland, employers of labor will prefer to insure rather
than accept the liability to be paid to workers in case of accident. This Company would, therefore,
have an assured income from its own Shareholders, who no doubt could and would influence further
business.

Great Motor Contest
MELBOURNE to SYDNEY.
Seven Cars scored full points in last
week’s contest—six being fitted with
DuniopTyres l
which stand unequalled for hard work
on Australian roads.
The cry of an Australian in Natal :
The repeated hearing's of the Nick Willis extradition
case were treated with indifference by the Natalians
(“ Only another Australian beauty ! ”). The local ’Roos
showed no interest. Bail was forthcoming from a Natalian
who answers advertisements re sale of Nick’s racers. The
only sensation was caused by a “ Benno ’’-like individual
who with great pride, announced himself as a horse
trainer and Justice of the Peace for N.S. W., and who was
armed with depositions from somebody in Australia. The
local Bench and Bar showed signs of collapse, and Nor-
man Lindsay would have struck something good in
depicting their features when this magistrate made him-
self known. If it is necessary to make “Benno,” or
“Micko,” or “ Johno” a J.P. the powers should not
allow him to roam further than Warwick Farm. When
he shows up in foreign parts the local Australians feel
downright small, and we even sneak The Bulletin into
our back pockets.
If Bendigo’s recently-deceased veteran,
J. D. Crofts, had been a plugger like Geo. Lan-
sell, what sweet chances he had ! When he was
quite an old hand at mining he held a lease which
took in what is now Lansell’s “ 180; ” he got
down to 115 ft., and then gave it best. Quite as
capable a man in most ways as his old friend “ the
quartz king,” and ten times more versatile, he
couldn’t “ plug.” He stopped at 115 ft. ; Lansell
gets to 4000 ft. or so. Crofts died poor ; Lansell
isn’t at all likely to.. The difference between the
man who can plug and the man who can’t.
Dead in London, aged 68, John Mac-
donald, mining director. He was a native of
Scotland, and began his Australian career as a
storekeeper at Ipswich (Q.). He moved on to
Charters Towers, when that field opened up in
1872, and set up as general merchant and mining
speculator. He amalgamated two claims on the
Queen line of reef, and floated them in London as
the Bonnie Dundee Gold Mine, Ltd. ; then he
floated the Day Dawn Block and Wyndham
G.M. Co. for half a million. In 1886 he became
an absentee in London, and except for a flying
visit to Australia last year this country has had
to support him as an absentee ever since.
■ Under the new Federal Standing Orders
there is to be no debate on a proposal that a
Bill be read a first time, on a proposal to adjourn
a debate, on a motion that the Chairman report
progress, on a motion that the Chairman leave the
chair, or on a motion that some business which
had lapsed for want of a quorum should be rein-
stated on the notice paper. All these matters are
as formal as a motion that the fire should be pokecV,
or the window opened at the top, but on these
pegs endless discussions have been hung—discus-
sions that were just as useless as a strangled
curate hanging from a nail. The object of the
new Standing Orders is to ensure that the House
shall only talk about business, and Heaven knows
it can talk enough about business without also
talking about things, that are not business. One
bad omission, however, is that the new Standing
Orders don’t abolish the useless, purposeless debate
on the Address-in-Reply.
From a man who knew him :
James Kiely, the W.A. veteran, aged 77, who was
recently pardoned by Edward VII., helped to make a little
Irish history. Kiely was a soldier of the 53rd Foot regi-
ment, which was stationed at Clonmel (Ireland) in 1866
what time evictions grew on hedges thereabouts. Parties
from the regiment were often detailed to back up the
law, and a lot of the men had no stomach for the sicken-
ing business. Kiely joined in a Fenian plot to raid
Clonmel armory, and seize the 2000 rifles and the
ammunition stored therein. Keys procured by the
plotters proved useless, and Kiely, W'ho had some
mechanical skill, manufactured a skeleton key.
With this he entered the armory “on his own,”
but before the arms could be removed the Law happened
along and arrested the plotters. After waiting seven
months in Dublin for trial, Kiely and many others were
exiled to Westralia, then a penal colony. Some of the
exiles escaped to America in 1870 ; later on, others were
pardoned, and drifted to the four winds, but Kiely
remained. He got his ticket-of-leave in 1878, and lived
on forgotten by the authorities. Lately he drifted across
the path of Rep. Mahon, of Coolgardie, who set the Com-
monwealth Government to work on his behalf, and a very
belated royal pardon ensued the other day.
The Russian row —half-revolution, half-
strike—had one humorous feature, anyway ; the
cable mentions that the revolutionists took posses-
sion of the office of the highly respectable Novoe
Vremya, and produced a Sunday edition, but in-
stead of filling it with the usual remarks concern-
ing law’n’order, packed it with screaming sedition.
The thing has its magnificent possibilities. If
only some Saturday night all the most violent
persons in Australia could get hold of the Sydney
Morning Herald, and send a Sunday morning
issue to all the parsons on the subscribers’ list
with the remark that Mr. James had decided to
“desecrate the Sabbath ” for the future ; and if it
then proceeded to curse everybody who had men-
tioned the Six Hatters, or the Six Potters, or the
Petriana myth with approval, and urge that a six-
penny land-tax was the least it would be satisfied
with ; also if it published a list of churchwardens
who notoriously sweated their employees, and re-
spectable citizens who drew rent from hovels and
bagnios ; and if it included in its market reports
current quotations for bribing various people with
secret commissions, &c.—what a Pleasant Sunday
Morning it would make.

INDIAN ROOT

THE STANDARD FAMILY MEDICINE.
Throughout Australasia Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a household remedy, and the antidote for all general ailments. In
thousands of homes the little amber bottle is the sole medicine chest, for there are few complaints in which Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills cannot be administered without beneficial results. The many wonderful cures effected by Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills have awakened
the interest of all classes of the community to the merits of these Pills. Years ago, pills were the medicine of the poor only. To-day the
efficacy of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills to overcome the common ailments of mankind has convinced not only the working section of the
population, but the more wealthy, professional and independent classes that Dr. Moises Indian Root Pills aie the best family medicine.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills have come to stay. They are an efficient, reliable and safe remedy, placed on the market at a price within the
reach of all. The Pills, being sugar-coated, are pleasant to take, and retain their full medicinal properties. They are packed in amber-
colored botlles —not in cheap wooden or pasteboard boxes—and are thus always fiesh and clean, impel vious to moisture, unaffected by climatic
conditions, and do not deteriorate by keeping as all liquid medicines do. The piudent housewife always keeps bottle in the house, for she
has learnt by experience that Nature occasionally requires some assistance, and that this assistance is best afforded by prompt recourse to
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. Many a serious illness may also be prevented by the timely use of these Pills, checking the disease in its
primary stage. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, being purely vegetable, do not weaken, sicken 01 gtipe, and may be taken with perfect safety
by the most delicate woman or the youngest child. The old and feeble will also find them a most suitable remedy for aiding and
strengthening their weakened constitutions.
DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS are a Perfect Blood Purifier, and a Sure Cure for Biliousness, Constipation,
Indigestion, Headaches, Sallow Complexion, Liver and Kidney Troubles, Piles, Pimples, Boils, and for Female Ailments.
THEY DO NOT WEAKEN. THEY DO NOT SICKEN. THEY DO NOT GRIPE .

Dr. RD. WALLACE, Chief Physician
We have
Cured
Hundreds
of Cases
Like Your
Own.
There is no eco-
nomy in employing
an amateur to do
an expert’s task.
Nine times in ten
failure follows. In
a large percentage
of instances the re-
sult is harm. The
average physician
is an amateur in
the treatment of
men’s diseases.
He doesn’t treat
enough cases to
learn a great deal about them. His time is so fully occupied in
treating a full assortment of human ills that he cannot devote special
study to any particular branch of practice. Most diseases are suffi-
ciently simple as to require no special training other than, that
received in the medical colleges and that afforded by experience in
general practice. The more cpmplex and perplexing ailments the
family practitioner seldom cares; to treat. He prefers to be relieved
of tasks beyond his training, thpugh cannot without fear of injuring
a patient’s confidence in his ability, recommend the services of a
specialist instead of his own.
The true specialist is a physician who is absolutely expert in the
treatment of a few diseases. Hfe knows all about the few diseases he
treats, and he treats difficult %ases with the same certainty with
which the general practitioner treats the most common ailment. For
sixteen years we have been treating men’s diseases only. We began
our special work after thorough preparation at the best medical
colleges and hospitals of the country, and have cured more men than
any other specialist in this Country, some of whom were themselves
physicians.
If afflicted with any of the ailments constituting our specialty,
seek an Expert’s and not an amateur’s services. You can come to us
knowing that we have treated hundreds of cases exactly like your own,
and thousands of others very similar. You can rest assured we will
know just what to do, that a complete and permanent cure will follow.
If you are suffering from any of the following ailments call at our
office or write at once for full information—
“Weakness”
Functional derangements, commonly termed “ weak-
ness,” are a direct result of inflammation, enlargement or
excessive sensitiveness of the prostate gland, brought on
by early dissipation or resulting from some improperly
treated disorder. These conditions cannot possibly be
removed by internal medicines, and any torno system of
treatment that stimulates activity of the functions can
but result in aggravation of the real ailment. This is a
scientific truth that we have ascertained after careful
study and observation in hundreds of cases, and is a truth
upon which our own original system is based. We employ
neither tonics, stimulants, nor electric belts. We treat
by local methods exclusively, and our success in curing-
even those cases that others have failed to temporarily
relieve with their tonics is conclusive evidence that our
method affords the only possible means of a complete and
radical cure.
Varicocele
Men who have for years been afflicted with varicocele
and who have chosen to suffer the consequences of neglect
rather than submit to the harsh, pa nfuland dangerous
surgical treatment commonly indulged jn, can come to us
with complete assurance that we will effect a permanent
cure in one week’s time by a painless and absolutely harm-
less method. Our treatment involves no cutting, and it
is seldom necessary that the patient be detained a single
day from his business. So painless, harmless and
thoroughly successful is our method that we regard each
case that comes to us as an opportunity for demonstrating
the superiority of gentle measures and the folly of resort-
ing to surgery. Do not submit to cutting’, pain, possible
injury and hospital expense. We will cure you quickly
and thoroughly without pain and without the need of
hospital care.
Pelvic Troubles
We cure these troublesome and positively dangerous
diseases in but half the usual time required, thus fore-
stalling chronic complications. A new and unique system
of treatment that cannot fail to cure both quickly and
thoroughly.
Varicose Veins
In our treatment mild and harmless measures have
again triumphed over surgery. We cure without pain,
and without cutting, and all the affected membranes are
thoroughly -cleansed and restored t,o a healthy state.
Blood Diseases
We cure these diseases—cure them thoroughly. Every
Symptom vanishes for ever, and the patient is relieved of
a mental burden that he has probably borne for years.
Harmless blood-cleansing remedies only are employed.
We are always willing to oblige in every detail
until a cure is effected.
Our office and operating theatre occupy three
floors, fully equipped and so arranged as to afford
all patients the utmost convenience and privacy.
Inability to come to our office fcr consultation and
treatment need not deprive you of our services. Our
knowledge of men’s diseases enablas us to treat
successfully at a distance. Write, describing your
symptoms in full, and we will advise you free of
charge, and will tell you whether we can cure you
without your calling in person.
We have published a 700-page medical work, “ Clini-
cal Experiences,” 31 chapters, 150 medical plates. It
will be found interesting, instructive and helpful by
all men suffering from special ailments. Write for
it. Mailed free, sealed and under plain cover.

If Australia’s present neglect of defence
continues the only thing we can do when the
Asiatic horde comes is to e p vin that we refuse to
fight them—that,, like American pugilists, we
“draw the color line.”
A Russian paper, the Slovo, sums up the
new Anglo-Jap alliance by remarking that Great
Britain “is speculating more cynically than any
other country on the assumption that Europe no
longer exists.”
The most striking feature of Circular Quay
nowadays is the way the German Steamship Co.
has increased its hold on the port of Sydney. Not
only does it own the biggest ships, but its trade
has grown so large that it has had to charter a
fleet of British vessels to assist in carrying it.
Absolutely the whole of its enormous cargoes
are Australian raw materials —wool, hides, zinc
ores, &c. —exported to Europe in the rough, and
much of them re-imported into Australia at a
vastly higher price as the m mufactured article.
And all the notice taken in the Foreign-trade
dailies of these evidences of the State’s industrial
backwardness consists of a shriek of pride about
the swelling export trade.
The citizens of Hawthorn (Melb.) are just
now looking with a jaundiced eye at their munici-
pal representatives. A yen-or two back a rate-
payer sued the council for damages to his
premises, caused by the overflowing of its main
drain. He got £250 damages, with costs ; where-
upon the council appealed to the Full Court
(which upheld the verdict, with more costs), then
to the Privy Council. This appeal has just been
thrown out on its ear, with much more costs. Safe
to say that more than the plaintiff’s £250 will be
swallowed up in his extraneous expenses not
covered by “costs,’’ while the precious councillors
who put up the regrettable fight—espeejadv the
unnecessary appeal to the Privy Council —won’t
have to part a penny, unless they put an extra
one on their 2s. rate, and that is not very likely.
Haw-hawthorn is the sort of place where an
adverse verdict of that sort usually passes on the
loan vote as a “permanent and reproductive
work.”


The Paradise
of Childhood
“ Childhood is the hap-
piest period of life.”
How tragic, then, when
the little one has to spend
the happy days of child-
hood on a bed of sick-
ness ! Or, without being
downright ill, the poor
little soul may be cruelly
distressed with childish
ailments, which render it languid
or fractious—a burden to itself,
an anxiety to its parents. If all
mothers only knew how easily
by the aid of Scott’s Emulsion of
cod liver oil with glycer-
ine and the hypophosphi-
tes of lime and soda the
troubled little one can
be made strong, joyous,
full of overflowing life !

The happy experience of Mrs.
A. M. Halls, of Fitzroy Street,
Burwood, n.s.w.,
is worth notic-
ing : On Septr.
2nd, 1904, she
wrote to us: “My
baby, aged four
months, had
been undersized
and delicate from
birth. He had a
dreadful cough
and was so ill
that I had small
hopes of ever
rearing him.
From the first
dose of Scott’s
Fmulsion I no-
ticed an improve-
ment. It agreed
well with him
and has built-up
his system so
thoroughly that
he is now as fine
and healthy a
child asyou could
wish to see.”
Scott’s Emul-
sion is the only
form of cod
liver oil which
can be taken
without nausea
and is bound to
dig'est, however
delicate the
baby stomach
nay be. SCOTT’S EMULSION cures
rapidly, and is therefore economical
in the truest sense.

1 AGREEABLE, MILD AND SURE
IT MAKES YOU SHUDDER!
JNo matter how dainty food may be, or how carefully prepared, it is
Dimply repugnent to you If your stomach is out of order. That dull pain
in your stomach causes you to simply loathe the sight of food-you can-
not eat. and yet you want something and don’t know what. When you
do eat. you suffer tortures afterwards. Do you realise what will happen
to you if you continue in this way ? Your body will become depleted and
any sickness is apt to take hold of you. If you escape such evils, you
do as lots of other dyspeptics have done—die of exhaustion.
You positively oan avoid all these troubles by taking
Dr. SHELDONS
estive Tubules.
The reason why any wholesome food is not properly digested is because
j the stomach lacks some-important element of digestion. Some stomachs
lack peptone, others are deficient in gastric juice or hydrochloric acid.
The one thing necessary in any case of poor digestion. Is to supply those
digestive elements which the stomach lacks, and nothing does this so
thoroughly and safely as DR. SHELDON’S DIGESTIVE TABULES.
They digest what you eat, thus giving the stomach a rest and assistance
until it is restored to its normal action and vigor.
One of these Tabules will digest 1500 grains of meat, eggs, and other
wholesome food. They are a genuine tonic, because they bring about in
the only natural way a restoration of nerve power, a buildir.g up, of lost
tissue and appetite, by the digestion and assimilation cf wholesome food.

“ w e must be careful not to do any thing, ’’said
ex-Governor Jersej' in a recent speech, “ which would
injuriously affect that most sensitive of plants— capital”
It is hard to see how capital can be called a sensitive
plant. It has its shape in land, in bullocks and sheep in
large, heavy lumps of iron and coal, in solid yellow
sovereigns, and other things equally hard to destroy You
may misuse it, and it is still there. You may jump on it
with both feet, and it will keep growing in spite of you
You couldn’t kill it unless you wrapped it in bags and
dropped it to the bottom of the sea—and then somebody
would dive down and bring it up again. Possibly in
some of its forms, you might burn it without getting
some other form of capital in its stead. Otherwise it’s
here to stay. The sensitive things are the inflated bub-
bles that pretend to be capital (but are not), and Usury
Usury is so sensitive that if you take the extinguisher off
it, it will grow as fast as the beanstalk that Jack planted
while if you look at it hard it denies its own existence
and tries to prove an alibi. And in this country the more
we can injure that sensitive plant called Cohen the better
it will be for us.

“Two Seas”: A new regulation affecting ap-
plications for Crown lands in N.S.W. which recently came
into force simply howls for explanation. Under the old
system, if a man putin an application fora C.P. at 10a m
any Thursday morning, and no other applicant for the
same land was present when the land office opened that
applicant secured the land without balloting—presuming
he afterwards proved his bonafides before the Land Board.
The lessee’s “ dummy ’’ has been known to gallop furiously
up to the land office with the necessary cash to take up
the same block—just ten minutes too late. But this new
regulation, so quietly and unobtrusively made the other
day, dispenses with all that unpleasant haste which the
lessee had to exercise whenever his boundary rider
reported that a suspicious-looking stranger had
been inspecting a portion of his resumed area with
“ selection ” written hard on his horrid countenance
This brand-new regulation, so gently insinuated, says
that all applications lodged within a week shall be
counted as having been made at the same time and
applicants will have an equal chance at the ballot on the
following Thursday. Thus, supposing a stranger on the
run is suspected of being an intending selector—and he
always is suspected of being one of those horrid creatures
—old Graball, instead of having to race the abandoned
wretch to the land office, drives calmly in the next morn-
ing, inspects the office maps, notes the block applied for
and arranges that the applicant shall not feel lonely when
he goes to the ballot on the following Thursday, but shall
have a dozen to keep him company. will Mr. Ashton
kindly explain for whose benefit this sudden new regula-
tion is designed? The only opinion I have extracted
from an official of the department is : “ It’s quite uncalled
for. No sense in it at all that I can see.” But there’s a
lot of sense in it when viewed by the man who wants to
block selection.

“R.A.K.”: Australia is just stuffed with
precious clays of all sorts, suitable for pigments. At
Black Flat, Mulgrave, Box Hill, Heidelberg, and all around
Melbourne, and in many other parts of the Common-
wealth, are claybeds, made up of alternations of dif-
ferent greys, yellows and reds, from which pigments of
every description pan be manufactured. Those who
ought to know argue that every pigment can easily be
made in Australia from Australian raw material. This is
another tip for the Protectionist.

“Jake”: Stalled, the other day, into a
Chinese cook-shop in Campbell-street, Sydney. Seeing
through the smoke the second cook, with trousers tucked
up and both bare feet in a large, globular, gourd-shaped
jar, I said to the boss-cookee, “ Whaffor that feller? No
good wash’em feet kitchen.” The boss stolidly and
reassuringly replied : “ No, no,; he no wash’em ; he pless
em down pickel.” The jar contained pickled cauli-
flower, and the second cook was assisting the steeping
process. He had a vegetable hanging out of his mouth
and reminded me of the ox that is not to be muzzled as
he tread eth out the cauliflower.
BLOWN IN THE BOTTLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I knew a happy man
With twinkles in his eyes ;
H:s clothes were built to plan,
His boots would take a prize.
He always jingled pelf
Until he took to grog,
And read a catalogue
Of “ how-I-saved-ni3'-dog, ’
And fell down like a log,
And then he said to Blogg,
“ Suffer from them meself! ”
’Tis sad to tell the same
Because he went to rack,
And very sbon became
A hypochondriac.
Said he was “ on the shelf”
When such was not the case.
He looked with saddened face
Upon the human race.
And walked with wobbling pace
And groaned about the place,
“Suffer from them meself! ”
They told him in the book
The case of Mrs. Brown,
And how the pressman took
The startling details down.
It must have been an elf
Who saved her—so he read.
She suffered from her head
And got no rest in bed ;
A mournful look then spread
O’er Jim’s face, as he said,
“ Suffer from them meself! ”
Thej' told him in the end
About their splendid stuff,
And if he wished to send,
A pound was quite enough.
They said he’d smash like delf
If he should take the view
That something else would do,
To please the chemist crew ;
And Jim he thought so too,
And said, in accents blue,
“ Suffer from them meself.”
He looked a scarecrow thing—
A thing hung out to dry—
He read that England’s King
Felt also far from spry,
The Royal House of CJuelph
Had took ill just like him.
It sort of cheered up Jim,
His eyes with tears were dim
And red about the rim.
He said (his tones were grim),
“Suffer from them meself.”
But let the truth be known,
He filled his aching throttle
One day when there was blown
No name upon the bottle.
He threw it out the door,
And then he went inside ;
The remnant of his pride,
And hope and joy beside,
Had come back to reside ;
And, jumping up, he cried,
“ Suffer from them no more.”

The Milk Foods closely approximate In composition to
human Milk, the natural and therefore best nourishment for
the young infant.
They are as easy of digestion as maternal milk, and
provide a perfect diet for the formation of firm flesh and
strong bones.
The Milk Foods are absolutely free from any noxious
germs, and hence are far superior to cow’s milk as obtained
in towns.
No diarrhoea, digestive or stomach troubles need be feared
from the use of the “Allenburys” Foods.
The Milk Foods can be made in a moment, hot water
Only being necessary.
The “Allenburys” Foods are so graduated as to provide
the maximum amount of nourishment that the child is able
to digest at the periods of life for which the foods are re-
spectively recommended. For the robust and delicate they
are alike suitable.

„ Benger’s Food has attained

stant recommendation of those

Efforts are being made in N.S.W. to
galvanise opposition among Carruthers’ bushy
supporters against the reduction of the vote for
agr.cultural societies. This annual cadge is
devoted by the societies to the local shows of each
district. At these gatherings the cocky who can
exhibit the most blatant pumpkin does not envy
the fame of Wellington or Victor Trumper, and
the prize-taker for the flagrant and globular
porker apes the importance of a land agent.
Reform in this direction hits the man on the land
in a tender place, and not one country M.L.A.
would dare to appear before his constituents after
having failed to join in the threatened demand in
the sacred name of the “Show.” Before this
demand Carruthers’ backbone is expected to
crumple as usual.
The Jap is about the finest specimen of
grasping iniquity on the face of this earth. A
year or two ago Japan demanded that all the un-
occupied .'atate Lands of Korea—-about two-thirds
of the country—atid practically all its mineral
areas should be handed over to a Japanese
company at a few coppers per square
mile. It didn’t carry its point then, but now that
the war is ended it will probably do so before
long. And Korea is supposed to be Japan’s
friend ; also Japan was supposed to be fighting to
secure Korea’s independence. Australia is also
supposed to be Japan’s friend by reason of its
connection with the British Empire. Also, the
British Government explains that Japan may
some day fight for Australia’s independence. It
seems a vast amount more dangerous to be Japan’s
friend than its enetnv.
‘L.”. Standing sometimes on those
magnificent steps in front of Melbourne Parlia-
ment House, and watching ancient members
climb painfully up and down, I wonder that Vic-
toria’s Legislative Council went so many years
without fearful casualties. Elderly gentlemen
who are in the habit of dining heavily are apt to
lose agility and sureness of foot, and I should not
be surprised any morning to hear of a stout land-
lord found bruised and battered on the pavement,
with large splashes of gore showing the way he
fell. When the Great Victorian Revolution
occurs (by which time the Australian Legislatuie
will be in a home of its own) I shall hurry to Par-
liament House to see the spectacle of spectacles.
Those steps must have been designed in order
that members of the House of Landlords might be
hurled down them by a maddened populace.

is at hand a certain cure for his weakness, a check to his loss of strength.
Most of the Pains, most of the Weakness of Stomach, Heart, Brain, and
Nerves, from which men suffer, are due to an early loss of Nature’s reserve
power through mistakes of youth. You need not suffer for this, you can
be restored. The very element which you have lost you can get back,
and you may be as happy as any man that lives.
Our ELECTRIC BELT, with ■pedal Electric Attachments, will
Restore your Strength, will Cheek all Drains, and will
give you back the old Vigop of Youth,
We have cured thousands of men who have squandered the savings of
years in useless treatments. Our Belt is easy to use ; you put it on when
you go to bed ; you feel the glowing heat from it (no sting or burn as in
old-style Belts), and you feel your nerves tingle with the new life flowing
into them. You get up in the morning feeling like a two-year-old.
Mr. L. Arrowsmlth, of Won go, via Manilla, N.S.W.*writes.
<> j w i s h to report to you the Marvellous Cure which the Electric Belt I obtained from
vou has effected in my case. I wore the Belt for three weeks, applying it when going
to bed and taking it off when rising in the morning. Before I obtained your Belt I
thought I would never be cured. I oould not sleep at night for the pain in my back,
but after wearing your Belt for one week the pain left my back, and since then I have
not lost one night’s sleep. I can now record a positive curt through your Belt.”
It Cures Rheumatism, Sciatic Pains, Lumbago, Kidney Troubles,
Weak Back, Nervousness, Indigestion, Dyspepsia, Gout,
Varicocele, and all Liver and Stomach Troubles.
Mr Fred. Fox, of White Cliff*, N.S.W., states: “After wearing one
of your High-Grade Belts for four months, I am glad to say that I am perfectly cured
of Bad Back and Debility, after suffering for fifteen years. I have had some rather
severe tests since leaving the Belt off, but have felt no ill effects. I would advise any-
cue suffering with a Bad Back to wear one of your Belts, which is a sure cure."
What ails you? Write and tell us, and no matter where you are, we
think we can give you the address of someone in your town who has been
cured. We’ve cured thousands, and every one of them is a walking
advertisement for our Belt,
Every man who ever used It recommends it, because it is honest.
It does great work, and those whom It has cured are
all the moro grateful because It costs so little.

WHAT IS CATARRH?
MEDICATOR.
g
Catarrh is inflammation of
the lining: membrane of the
nose and adjoining passages.
If this inflammation is not
arrested it invades the pas-
sages which lead from the
nose to the head; ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the
sight and hearing, destroys
the sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the
small frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and sto-
mach, causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want
relief and cure? If so, try

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.
Q. I have been feeling very poorly lately, and have just been told by my doctor that lam Buffering
from uric poisoning. I shall be glad if you will tell me just what uric poisoning means. Is it a
serious matter ?
A. Uric poisoning is caused by the retention in the blood of various substances which should
leave the body in solution. The retention of these substances is due to a diseased or inactive condition
of the kidneys. When the kidneys are working perfectly, they filter and extract from the blood of the
average individual about three pints of urine every day. In this quantity of urine should be dissolved
various waste material produced by the wear and tear of the tissues of the body. This is dead matter,
and its presence in the blood is poisonous. The three pints of normal urine should contain about ten
grains in weight of uric acid, an ounce of urea, together with other animal and mineral matter varying
from a third of an ounce to nearly an ounce!
Q. Then I am to understand that the substances you mention when not eliminated from the body
in the natural manner constitute what is known as uric poisoning. What are the usual symptoms by
which the presence of these poisons is manifested ?
A. Now you are asking a rather large question. Many complaints which are commonly called
diseases are not actually diseases in themselves. For instance, Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago,
Sciatica, Gravel, Stone and Bladder Troubles are all caused by uric poisons. Indigestion, Anaemia,
Persistent Headache, and General Debility are often solely due to the same cause. In fact, if the
kidneys are doing their work freely and thoroughly, none of the complaints mentioned could trouble
us, as the causative poisons would be absent.
Q. I had no idea that so much depended upon the efficient action of the kidneys. I suppose that
when anyone is suffering from Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Sciatica, Gravel, Stone,
Bladder Troubles, Anaemia, Debility, Persistent Headache or Indigestion, the scientific method of
effecting a cure would be to directly treat the patient for the kidneys?
A. Exactly. In fact, that is the only way in which a radical and permanent cure can be effected.
The kidneys must be restored to health and activity, so that they may be enabled to remove the daily
production of poisons in the body, or the patient must continue to suffer.
Q. I have always been under the impression that the liver had a great deal to do with the main-
tenance of our general health, but it seems that the kidneys are the chief cause of most of the dis-
orders from which we suffer.
A. The work done by the liver is of the utmost importance, and it is closely associated with the
work done by the kidneys. Indeed, when anything is the matter with the liver the kidneys are
almost always directly affected, and the contrary is likewise true. In the liver various substances are
actually made from the blood. _ Two or three pounds of bile are thus made every day. The liver takes
sugar from the blood, converts it into another form, and stores it up so as to be able again to supply it
to the blood, gradually, as the latter requires enrichment. The liver changes uric acid, which is
insoluble, into urea, which is completely soluble, and the liver also deals with the blood corpuscles
which have lived their life and are useful no longer.
Q. As the functions of the kidneys and liver are so intimately related, I gather that if there is
reason to suspect that either organ is not doing its work efficiently, a curative agent should be em-
ployed which would act equally upon the kidneys and liver ?
A. Yes, that is the case, and it was the realisation of this important fact which led to the dis-
covery of that invaluable medicine, Warner’s Safe Cure. About thirty years ago, certain medical men,
knowing that if they could find a medicine which would beneficially affect alike the kidneys
and liver, they could control most of the common disorders, devoted themselves to the search
for such a remedy. After many disappointments, their efforts were rewarded, and a medicine
now known as Warner’s Safe Cure was proved to possess the required properties in the
fullest degree. Warner’s Safe Cure has a marvellously stimulating and healing effect upon
both the kidneys and liver, and by restoring those vital organs to health and activity, it necessarily
cures all disorders due to the retention in the blood of urinary and biliary poisons, such as Rheumatism
Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Sciatica, Blood Disorders, Ansemia, Indigestion, Biliousness, Jaundice’
Gravel, Stone, Bladder Troubles, General Debility, and Sick Headache. Even Bright’s Disease’
probably the most fatal of all diseases, yields to treatment by Warner’s Safe Cure. Cures effected by
Warner s Safe Cure are permanent simply because they are natural. [a

SWIFT was our glance as a stab,
> Meeting and severing thus—
You flashing past in a cab,
I on the top of a ’bus.
So I have found you at last.
This moment opened a door,
Flooding our souls with the Past:
So —I have known you before !
You are the woman I sought
Age after age endlessly ;
Fierce to possess you we fought—
All the dead egos in me.
As in those lives far removed,
Once more our pathways have crossed;
Yours the one soul that I loved,
Longed for and reached for....and lost!
You are the same. I recall
All the desire and the strife ;
You are the one in them all
I have loved life after life.
Lost you, I treasured your lips,
Ever remembered your eyes.
Death after death might eclipse f
I with each dawn recognise.
So that I know you are you,
Choose you so surely from all.
You have remembered me, too :
Your new self strives to recall.
Swift that old hunger for you
Woke in me unreconciled;
And in that moment I knew,
And in that moment you smiled !
For, through our loving, the grave
Closed in forgetfulness, yet
Keepsakes, mementoes you gave—
Trusting I should not forget,
Till I am but as a scroll
Telling an old tale anew :
All this rich garment, my soul,
Patterned with memories of you !
, Aeons ago we first met.
Till in our splendor we mate
Aeons jnust pass and forget,
Drowsing Eternity wait.
And in those long years aloof
Lives upon lives yet must run,
Till I, the warp, you, the woof,
Richly are woven in one.
And in that future, at last,
This meeting we may discuss—
You in a cab drifting past,

ARTHUR H. ADAMS.
In Hospital.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CRONMEYER was a brisk little Jew, with
birdy bright eyes, close together over his
fat nose, and the neatest little patent
leather boots the heart of man could conceive.
He had the racial facility for doing the Gentile in
the eye first, last, and every time, and even those
of his own nation, while they hopefully followed
his lead in all matters relating to the money-
market—particularly mines—thought it well to
keep a wary eye as much on what he came out of
as on what he went into. There was one mine
he took altogether under his wing. As coal was
supposed to come out of it, it was appropriately
named the Black-but-Comely, and the way it
boomed along was enough to make the mouths
water of all those left outside in the cold. The
competition for shares was tremendous; you
couldn’t get the ghost of a look-in for love or
money—except as a peculiar and personal
favor, which favor, being gradually ex-
tended by secret and imperceptible de-
grees, the outsiders one day awoke to
the fact that whoever held shares in that desirable
enterprise Mr. Cronmeyer certainly did not. He
had also as managing director (with a few dummy
directors to make up a Board) had command of
everything, and an extraordinary meeting of
agitated shareholders revealed the inexplicable
but complete disappearance of much liquid assets
and a large amount of debenture money. There
could be little doubt that the brisk Cronmeyer
had transferred a very large fortune to some yet-
to-be-discovered retreat under a name known only
to himself.
* * * *
A week before this revelation took place, a
neat little dark man, in a grey flannel suit and
Panama hat, was shown into the consulting room
of one of the N Macquarie-street doctors.
“Doctor,” said the little man, “I’ve got to
leave here to-morrow morning. My berth is
reserved, and go I must. But I’ve been feeling
confoundedly seedy the last few days—heart
tumbling about and all that sort of thing, you
know. I’ve had an anxious time lately—been
doing a bit too much I expect—so I want you to
overhaul me, and give me a pick-me-up that will
get me safely out to sea. I know I’ll be all right
there. The sea always does me good.”
The doctor eyed him doubtfully, and began
poking and tapping, and telling him to say
“ninety-nine” m a systematic way, and finally
took his temperature. With a lift of the eyebrow,
as he saw what the thermometer registered, he
said :
“ I’m afraid you won’t start to-morrow.”
“Hang it, I must!” said the little man ; but
even as he spoke he went hot and coldfall over,
and found himself clumsily knocking into the
doctor, who, with a firm hand under his arm,
steered him to the couch and laid him down on it!
In a minute or two he looked up, rather haggard!
“ What had I better do ? ” he asked.
“A private hospital is the best place for you,”
said the doctor. “I’ll arrange it for you if vou
“£e. You can wait here till the ambulance comes.
Where are you staying, and what name shall I
say ? ”
“At the Metropole, number 76, name of
d on es, said the little man, and then he closed his
eyes and held on to the couch, feeling very faint,
with waves of heat going over him, while the
d'ootor rang up hospital, hotel, and ambulance, and
settled the whole business in five minutes. He
looked several times at Mr. Jones, who lay very
still, breathing rather fast, with a hot color rising
by degrees to his face, and packed him carefully
off at the end of a quarter of an hour with special
injunctions to the ambulance men to waste no
time on the way.
Mr. Jones, after a very muzzy time of noise and
movement, lifting and setting down, and the
coming and going of what seemed like thousands
of people (yet all a long way off), found himself in
a neat bare bed, in a neat bare room colored
ducky green on the walls, with big, naked win-
dows set wide to catch all possible air. A calm
and friendly young person in a blue uniform, also
rather neat and bare, came and looked at him and
asked him if he wanted anything, to which he re-
sponded quite cheerfully, “Nothing, thanks,”
and went on breathing away in a sort of anxious
style as if he wasn’t quite sure he could keep up
the requisite supply of air as thoroughly as he
would like. Then he dozed a bit and woke up
with a start in a sort of hot, miserable fright.
“ i shall miss my boat,” he called hoarsely, and
then remembered, with a quite amazing sense of
relief, that he didn’t have to catch that boat after
all. He drank milk when the blue nurse told him
to, and took medicines as ordered by the same
kindly autocrat, and spent many, many hours as it
seemed to him, or days, or centuries, dozing and
dozing, and always waking up with the same hot,
startled misery. It didn’t last long, for he dozed
again in two minutes, but he found it pretty
tiring while it lasted. Next day a cheery, loud-
voiced matron, all in snowy white, came and looked
at him, and said what a fine day it was, and Mr.
Jones, who had always liked the ladies and rather
fancied himself on his society manners, perked up
and answered quite gaily for nearly three minutes.
Then he retired mentally into the depths of the
bed, with his head spinning, and his heart thump-
ing, and his hands gripping the clothes lest he
should go quite down into the abyss and never
come up again.
By the end of the week he knew a number
of blue nurses by sight, though his memory, on
which he had always prided himself before, re-
fused to be burdened with any of their names.
Every morning he had a few sprightly words with
the matron, but that seemed about all he could
stand for the day. By the time the doctor came
he only wanted to be let alone, and his “ninety-
nines” were distinctly grumpy. How glad he
was to lie down again and be quiet; only the worst
of it was, he couldn’t lie really down—that
hurried anxiety for breath grew more insistent.
Lots of visitors came and went all day in the cor-
ridors —rather noisy some of them, laughing and
talking—but they sounded very kind and cheery
going by his door, and he didn’t mind them. Then
by degrees, as the light waned, the sounds grew
fewer. His pet little nurse—he hardly knew
when she was in the room, she moved so
gently—brought in a lamp and shaded it
from his eyes very carefully. Then she said :
“Now what do you say to some milk?” as if it
were quite a new idea, whereas he had never had
so much milk in all his life before, barring the first
year of it. He could hear the day nurses troop
off down the stairs, all chattering together, and
the head night nurse came and looked at him, but
he didn’t trouble to speak. Then it would get
very quiet—only an old man opposite with a deep
slow cough and a small boy farther down the cor-
ridor with a high, quick cough disturbed him a
little one night.
“Sort of big bear and little bear,” he thought
drowsily. “ Where’s the middle-sized bear, I
wonder?” and drifted off into uneasy dreams
again, where this time bears came after him
with their little red eyes glowing nearer, nearer,
till he woke trembling and called “Nurse ! ” and
then rang the little bell by his bedside, he felt so
frightened and'shaky. The stern head nurse came
and looked at him with her black eyes, and he was
quite apologetic, but when he tried to explain he
got very confused, and she said firmly, “Now, you
must go to sleep,” which, indeed, he had already
done.
The seventh evening of his illness he was
having his face washed by the little nurse and
telling her rather fretfully to mind his nose, when
there came a sound of loud talking from the hall
below. Mr. Jones suddenly sat up straight in
bed.
“ What’s that ?** he said, and caught the little
nurse by the arm.
“ Only somebody asking about a patient,” she
said, soothingly. “ They often come here looking
for people we haven’t got.”
She tried to go on with the face washing, but
he put the sponge aside irritably and sat bolt
upright, supporting himself on his hands, and
listening, listening, listening. The talking below
grew louder —for a moment it sounded angry—•
and then it died away as the speakers, whoever
they were, passed out at the doorway.
‘* I can’t be washed any more, ” said Mr.
Jones, faintly, and collapsed on to his pillows.
The night nurse visited him very often that night,
and every time she came in, however quietly,
he started bolt upright, staring at her. By
morning he was beginning to wander a little, and
it took two more pillows to prop him up so that he
could fetch his breath. He was very, very drowsy,
but he roused many times to say, “ I must get up
soon or I shall miss my boat,” and the little nurse
—she had such pretty fluffy hair under her cap, he
noticed —always answered soberly, “You needn’t
get up yet, there’s plenty of time.” He said to
her once—after just sipping at the milk she
brought him because he didn’t like to let her take
the trouble for nothing—“ First time I go out I’ll
send you the smartest hat in Sydney. It would
look something like on that hair.”
Then he said, turning a little on his side, “I
think I’ll just take a snooze. Don’t let me sleep
too long, nurse,” and dropped into the usual
troubled sleep. But towards evening he could not
rest. A special nurse was sitting up with him—a
fat girl that he didn’t like ; she talked loudly, and
whispered, and clumped with her heels. He
stared at her as it were from a great way off
and heard himself say in the queerest croaking
voice, “No, she’ll never wake me in time.”
So he tried to keep awake, and then he was
sure it was time to start, and he began to get out of
bed. The fat nurse reasoned with him, and even
Laid a restraining hand on him, but that made
him very angry, and he began to talk loudly.
“Go away ; don’t you touch me ! I tell you it’s
time to be off.” Then she went and fetched the
head nurse. He recognised her, and did what she
told him, but when she had tucked him into bed
again he pulled her head down and whispered—
“ You won’t let them in, will you. Say I’m not
here, you know. Mind, mind now.”
The fat nurse followed her outside.
“I can’t manage him a bit,” she said, “can’t
you change with me ? He attends to you.”
The head nurse thought a minute.
“ All right,” she said, “ I’ll stay, but don’t for-
get No. 16’s medicine, and No. 5 is having food
every two hours. You’ll see when by the card.”
This was about nine o’clock, and it must have
been close on eleven when the electric bell of the
front door downstairs struck suddenly across the
silence. Mr. Jones had been quietened by the head
nurse’s presence, and through all the two hours
he had drowsed, only waking twice, to say first
“ Is the front door shut ? ” and again “ Mind now,
I’m not here ”; but his eyes when they opened
were terribly wideawake, bright and startled, and
his breath came with ever greater labor. The
sound of the bell brought him upright with a jerk.
Hold his breath he could not. The shuddering,
long-drawn hiss of each laborious inspiration
sounded clamorous in the quiet house. But his
whole body was listening. The front door was
opened, voices sounded speaking together, raised
in anger, and then feet on the stairs. With an
anxious look at the sick man the head nurse went
to the room door to still the disturbance. She
heard a man’s voice, deep and angry, say—
“ But I will see him ; I know he’s here. I must
and will see him.” And a shrill elderly voice
joined in—
“ My good young woman, this is a matter of the
utmost importance. You don’t understand —of
the utmost importance.”
Before she could close the door they came
tramping along the corridor —a burly, big man in
tweeds, red and hairy, with little angry eyes, and
a thin short old gentleman wrapped in a long top-
coat, over the turned-up collar of which a pair of
neat white whiskers showed. Both were but
newly off a journey, the stains of travel were still
on them.
“This Mr. Jones’s room?” growled the big
man, and the little one chimed in : “Excuse me,
nurse, our errand here is of the greatest import-
ance.”
She tried to bar the way,, saying :
“Mr. Jones is far too ill to see anyone,” but
they marched in as if she had not been there.
“Now, look here, Cronmeyer,” said the big
man, “we’ve run you to earth. There’s no
getting away now, and you’ve just got to tell us
where you’ve invested that money, and under
what name.”
He bent threateningly over the bed and shook
a finger in the sick man’s face.
“ Speak out, you ! ” he said.
“Mr. Cronmeyer,” piped the elderly gentle-
man, “I hope you will see reason and give us no
more trouble. <We’re not vindictive—we’ve no
intention of setting the law in motion against you
if you meet us halfway, sir—if you meet us half-
way ; but the money we must and will have.”
The big man laid a heavy hand on Cronmeyer’s
shoulder. He was shaking with passion, and
looked as if he would wring out an answer by
main force.
“ Speak out! speak out, I tell you ; where is it
and in what name ? ” he shouted.
All this time the sick man—motionless save for
the vibration that affected his whole body as he
drew each breath and the tremulous working of
his liarids —had kept his eyes unwinkingly fixed on
the big man’s face. There was such an expression
of terror in them that the head nurse, with a sort
of groan, rushed at the other, crying “Ring up
the doctor! Ring him up, quick ! ” and then
came panting back to do battle for her patient.
“Leave the room at once,” she said; “don’t
you see you’re killing him? Oh, go !go!go ! ”
and she stamped her foot and wrung her hands in
an agony of impotence as they took no notice
whatever of her words. She laid hold on the big:
man to drag him away, but he shook her off like a
kitten. Then she appealed to the old one, but he
said :
“Excuse me, nurse, this is a matter the im-
portance of which you cannot estimate.”
Suddenly Cronmeyer closed the conference him-
self with the promptitude which had distinguished
him all his life. His last laborious breath stopped
•dead at its very beginning, a wave of bluish color
rose up over his face, and as it sank left behind it
a deathly pallor ; then the breath bubbled out of
him once and for all, and he tumbled over side-
ways limply among his pillows. During one
endless minute they waited to hear him draw his
next breath, then the elderly man said, shakily ;
“ I fear Mr, Cronmeyer has —er
“Cleared, the our, damn him,” growled the
burly man, and, turning, without further parley
they marched out, leaving Cronmeyer master of
the situation,

Zl
OMEN are the chief sufferers from
Summer Fag. Hard work indoors, lack
of fresh air, and home worries, spoil the
w
appetite, impoverish the blood, weaken
the system, and bring on that weary fagged feel-
ing. To avoid this lassitude one thing is neces-
sary —the whole system, and especially the diges-
tive organism, MUST be in perfect and regular
working order. For this purpose there is fio
preparation so effective as BILE BEANS FOR
BILIOUSNESS. Acting in a gentle manner, they
do not (as many other purgatives do), achieve a
temporary abatement of the trouble, but eventually
leave the system weaker than ever. On the con-
trary, they strengthen and build up the whole
digestive organism, purify the blood, and tone up
the nervous system. They have already
proved themselves the very best medicine for
all Summer ailments, and are admitted to be
the foremost remedy in Australasia. A course
of Bile Beans will enable you to move round
this Summer with a light step and increased
vitality. There will then be no lack of energy
or “ Summer Fag” to mar the pleasures of
the Summer season. As a striking illus-
tration, Mrs. Sarah Lewis, of 5 Avon-streef,
Glebe Point, Sydney, says : —“ Some twelve
months ago a friend of mine told me she had used
your Bile Beans, and that they had cured her of
Biliousness, and as I was at the time run down
from anxiety and over-work, she advised me to try
them. I needed a real ‘pick-me-up,’ as I felt as
tired in the morning as when I went to bed, and my
appetite was greatly impaired ; in fact, I was quite
done up, and did not know what to take to recover
my strength. Although I was a little prejudiced
agaihst medicines in general, I was persuaded to give
your Bile Beans a trial, and it is with much pleasure
that I tell you that a very few of them worked a
miracle with me. I began to feel the benefit at once
by being quite bright after taking one or two at
night, and my usual health began to return to me. I
would now have no other medicine in the house.”

WE are the ghosts of the men unburied,
We are the wraiths of the seameri
drowned,
Haunting the raiiks of the rollers serried,
Breasting the strength of the gales unbound;
Ghosts of the men who died grimly, grimily,
While shrill winds Wailed and the sun shone dimiy,
With the clouds above and’the sea around.
Our bdnes are hidden in divers places.
By long, black reefs that the tall ships shun ;
On sunny sands that the foam enlaces,
In narrow straits where the tide rips run.
On shattered hulks they are drifting, drifting,
With the veering winds and currents shifting,
Till the sea shall end what it has begun.
Winging aye on a quest that’s bootless,
Day by day, to windward and lee,
We hover over the sea plain fruitless,
With the homeless clouds for company.
Ever and aye we are flying, flying,
The seamen know when they hear us crying,
The hail of the men who were lost at sea.
There is no rest from the west wind’s urging,
’Twixt the blue sea floor and the blue sky’s dome.
We find no peace from the combers, surging,
The flying drift and the frothing foam ;
With wistful hearts we are waiting, waiting,
For skies dissolving and seas abating,
And the hour to come that shall call us home.
This is the legend I heard them tell
One windy watch on the Fairy Bell,
As the red sun sank o’er the ocean’s lip,
And theseabirds wheeled round the driving ship.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HEALTH,” remarked Mr. Barnes,
with thoughtful expectoration, “isone
of ’em things wat y’ on’y appre-
ciate when y’ ain’t got it—same as another bloke’s
wife. The chief advantage in bein’ ’ealthy is in
givin’ advice to ’em as ain’t. It’s a great conser-
lashun to ’ave them patent pill advertisements
read over to y’ an’ then to think of all ther things
a cove could ’ave wrong wid ’im. It kinder con-
soles a man to be alive at all.
“ I knew a bloke onst, up at Gaskar Crik—Jarge
Mills by name, though we mostly called him Doc.
—’oo wuz a fair tiger fer all that sorter racket.
’E muster spent millions in ’is time, buyin’ up all
the patent pain-killers and stuffs ’e could ’ear of.
Fun o’ ther world ! It got sicb a cravin’ wid ’im
at ther last, that I do believe ’e would o’ rather
’ad a black draught than a pint. ’E wuz never so
’appy as when ’e ’ad found ’e ’ad summat noo
wrong wid ’im, an’ wuz alus worryin’ round the
boys'tellin’’em’ow ill they wuz,-till’e become a
pest.
“One night, Doc. found that Jerry Lane, me
mate—’oo ’ad bin a little tight .ther night afore—
’ad no less than forty-sevin diff’rent an’ warious
diseases on ’im. ....
“ ‘.list look at that, now ! ’ sed Doc., proudly,
slappin’ Jerry on ther back. ‘ Look at ’im. Wot
a hawful eggsample ! Till a few short minutes
ago ’e wuz walkin’ round, in ignerence an’ con-
tentment, thinkin’ ’e wuz a ’ealthy man ; and
now, wif the aid of a little science, I ’ave proved
to the satisfacshun of all that ’e isja seethin’ mass
of mi-crobes. _ Mi-crobes,’ sed Doc., warmin’ up
to ’is work, ‘is the greatest invenshun o’ modern
times. Everything’s mi-crobes- now. I’m a
mi-crobe. Y’re a mi-crobe.’
“ ‘ I’ll punch y’ in yer jore ! ’ sed Jerry.
“ ‘ Why, years an’ years ago,’ resoomed Doc.,
‘afore we cum to Australier, ther blackfellers
useter live their lives in ignerence an’darkness,
never knowin’ nuthin’ ’bout sickness- or kidney
pills, an’then they’d die an’ never knowed wat
killed ’em, poor beggers.’
“‘Come ’ere,’, he said ter Jerry, ‘while I goes
through y’ agen an’ see if I can’t make the diseases
an even number.’
“But Jerry cared less than nuthin’ ’bout even
numbers, an’ sed so. _ Therefore three more o’ the
boys ’elped to ’old ’im—makin’ six in all—while
Doc. consulted ’is books an’ things, and sounded
an’ prodded Jerry like ’e wuz a cow in ther sale-
yards. ‘ Ah,’Led ’e at last, ‘ qre we ’ave it. Now
let the patient attend carefully. D’ y’ suffer from
shortness o’ breaf ? ’
“ ‘My oath,’ sed Jerry, wi’ convicshun.
“ ‘ Y’ see,’ sed Doc., turnin’ to the company, ‘I
thought so. ’E suffers from shortness o’ breaf.’
“‘Breaf!’ said Jerry; ‘Garn! I thought y’
sed cash!’. .
“There was some disturbance just about here,
through the patient breakin’ loose. But when he
was captured again, Doc. looked in his book an’
asked if Jerry ’ad disturbed sleep, I sed ’is
snorin’ at night disturbed my sleep something
dreadful.
“ ‘ Then,’ ses ’e, closin’ ’is book, an’ speakin’ in
an awed voice, ‘ I kin confidently say ther total is
forty-eight.’
“Y’ should ’ave ’eard the ringin’ cheer wat
went up—jist like at a cricket match. Some
rushed up ter Jerry an’ patted ’im on ther back,
an’ congratulated ’im sif ’e’d won Tattersall’s;
while others shook ’im solemn an’ sad by the ’and,
an’ ’oped that ’is end might be peaceful. Jerry
stood it well till Doc, telled ’im ’e might live ther
night, an’ shoved a box o’ pills an’ a bundle o’
tracks into ’is ’ands. Then me mate shoved ’is
fist inter Doc.’s jore-bone, an’ we went ’ome,
leavin’ Jarge Mills an’ ’is medicines on ther floor,
nursin’ ’is face an’ discoursin’ to ther flies on
ingratitood.
“ Next mornin’, fer all’is four dozen diseases,
Jerx - y wuz up betimes an’ wuz just brushin’ down
’is ’ide wi’ the ’orse-brush —I must say Jerry alus
wuz neat an’ cleafi—when in steps Doc. wid ’is
face all over plaster—not proper stickin’-plaster it
wuzn’t, but one of ’em kidney-soothers, which, as
Jarge sed ’imself, ‘answered lovely, though it
didn’t look it.’
“ ‘Ah,’ sed ’e, when ’e saw Jerry, ‘in spite o’
yer ingratitood, Jarge Mills ain’t ther man ter
let y’ die like a corpse if ther medical knowledge
’e possess will ’elp. I’m glad y’ survived ther
night—l fear nothin’ woulder saved y’ if y’ ’adn’t.
As it is, y’ may jist pull through, though-don’t-
let me buoy y’up too much. We must diet’im,
Jim—very little ter eat an’ very seldom; nothin’
rich, an’, above all, no beer.’
“ ‘ What! ’ screamed Jerry ; * ’ere,- git out,’ an
he looked that liercei the Doc.; ’e got.
“ Two minutes arter the kidney-plaster, accom-
panied by Doc.’s face, appeared round ther door,
an’, in a stern voice, ’e sed, * I’ll look back later.
Remember—no beer ! ’ Then, duckin’ quick:}'
as a boot went smack agon ther door, ’e departed.
“That night Jerry’ad a ’eap o’ trouble at the
Bowyang Arms; First Sly Mick; arter consultin’
Ddc. Mills, refused to serve ’ini,. Sayin’ ’e didn’t
want Jerry’s blood on’is’ead tvi’Jerry owin’ ’im
close on 5/-; Then when me mate did curse si
pint outer ’im, Doc. rushes up an’ empties a
bottle o’ medicine, wat smelt like a glue factory,
inter ther beer, sayin’, like a play actor; ‘ I’ll save
’im in spite o’ ’imself.’ Arter which it took ten of
us to save ’im from Jerry.
“ Next day, Lane ’ad a worser experience. ’E
come across Sam Riley an’Olutcher Wilson sinkin’
a shallow ’ole down by the clump o’ wattles, wat
wuz our cemet’ry. When they caught sight o’
Jerry, they looked like they’d seen a ghost, or like
a man looks when ’e ’olds fours agen a straight
flush.
“‘Wadjer mean by lookin’ at me like so?’
yelled Jerry. * Wadjer diggin’ ? ’
“ Olutcher wiped ther sweat from ’is ’ead. ‘ A
grave,’ ’e answered, solium-like.
“ l ’Oo for?’ asked Jerry, strivin’ to becalm;
but they only shook their ’eads mournful.
“ ‘ We’ll be ded sorry to lose y’,’ sed Sam.
“ ‘We will,’ sed Olutcher ; ‘I alus wuz fond o’
y\ Jerry, an’ if y’ could see yer way ter let me
’ave that bull-pup o’ yourn, I’
“ *’Oo —’oo tole y’ to—to fix this up?’ gasped
Jerry, gulpin’ noisily.
“‘Doc.,’ sed Olutcher, *’e sed y’ll be very
catchin’ when y’re ded, an’ that we’ll ’ave to plant
y’ quick. If y’ could fix up about that dorg
now ’ But Jerry, ’oldin’ on to ’isself wi’ both
’an'ds, wuz staggerin’ towards the pub.
“ ‘ Gi’ us a brandy, quick !’ ’e groaned.
“ Sly Mick shook ’is ’ead very sorrowful. * No,
Jerry, ole man, it can’t be did,’sed’e. “I likes
y’ too much. ’Sides, Doc. ses ’e’ll ’ave me up fer
murder if 1 supplies y’ any licker. I’ll alus think
kindly of y’, an’ I’d like summat to remember y’
by. That bull-pup o’ yourn, now’
“Jerry looked wildly at ’im fer some time.
Then, widout so much as a cuss, ’e lurched to ther
door an’ went out. ’Twas then I realised Doc.
wuz right, an’ Jerry wuz near death. It wuz
’eartbreakin’ not to ’ear ’im swear ! Doc. an’ me
’urried ’ome arter ’im, an’ found ’im sittin’ on ’is
box, gazin’ melancholy-like at a photygraph of ’is
last mash.
“ ‘ Alri, ole mon,’ ses I, soothingly; ‘ I’ll break
it to ’er gentle. ’
“ ‘ To ’ell wid ther pair o’ yer !’ ’e snapped.
“ ‘ It ain’t no good yer goin’ on this ’ere way,’
sez Doc.; ‘ give in an’ go ter bed like a Cheristian.
Y’re deadly ill. Why, I’ve seed men wi’ only
one or two o’ the complaints y’ ’ave peg out inside
the hour. ’
“’E give Jerry several instances wat ’e ’ad
known, but it on’y made me mate mad, an’ when
Doc. took a big bottle outer ’is pocket an’ gave it
to the sufferer, sayin’ it’d hease ’im a lot an’ make
’is end more peaceful, Jerry donged ’im over th’
’ead widfit, so that I ’ad to carry Doc. home.
When I%ot back, Jerry’ad eat an’ drunk every-
thing in sight, an’ ’ad gone to sleep wid all my
beddin’ over ’im.
“Next mornin’ ’e wuz more reasonable, an’,
admittin’ ’e wuz sick, stayed in ’is bunk, so I ’ad
to go ter work at ther claim alone wi’ a ’eavy ’eart.
“When I got ’ome that night, there wuz no
food in sight, nor could I find any terbaccer. Doc.
Mills wuz with ’im, ’owever, smokin’ a pipe o’
mine. ’E laid’is’and on ’is lips an’ sed ‘Ssh!’
several times loudly. ‘ ’E’s sleepin’ peaceful now.
’E ain’t got long, poor feller—l’ll stay wid ’im ter
the end.’ ’E went out an’ returned wi’ all ’is
goods on ’is back. Then e’ occupied my bunk.
“So things went on fer a week—me all ther
time workin’ ther claim on me own and sleepin’
on the floor. I wuz ’orribly cut up about Jerry,
too. ’E still clung ter life, an’ though ’e could
on’y speak in whispers, ’e wuz very large an’
plump ter look at. But Doc. sed they all looked
like that when they wuz as bad as Jerry wuz, an’
that ’e ’ad taken a turn fer the bad an’ Doc. didn’t
like ’is simptims. All that could be done,
accordin’ to Doc. wuz to keep up ’is strength by
feedin’, an’ that ’e must ’ave plenty o’ spirits to
keep’is’eart movin’. Doc.’ad now discovered a
forty-ninth disease in Jerry that could on’y be
combatted by stimulants, an’ as they owed Sly
Mick for most of the whisky he was very angry
and wanted to know if Jerry couldn’t die of one
of ’is cheaper complaints. It was marvellous how
much food an’ drink Jerry put away. But it all
did no good. He lay there weaker an’ weaker
though ’is appetite woulder shamed a dingo.
“ Another fortnight went by, me doin’ all ther
work an’ Jerry gettin’ all ther luxuries. Then,
one night, I come ’ome, ’ot an’ dog-tired, and Doc.
come tip-toein’ out ter meet me.
“‘Y’rejist in time,’ ’e whispered. ‘lt’s ther
last flicker o’ the candle. Olutcher Wilson came
to-day an’ brought ’im a big bunch o’ wild flowers.
Jerry didn’t seem to like ’avin’ ’im around, an’,
when ’e got ’old o’ Jerry’s big wellin’tons an’ tried
’em on, I could see Jerry wuz upset, an’ told
Olutcher to ’ook it. But ’e ’eld on to the boots,
an’ tole Jerry ’e wood look arter ’is dorg when ’e
wuz gone, an’ Jerry jumped up an’ give Olutcher
such a smack on ther j ore as eaused ’im ter go
’ome on a door. But it’s ther last flicker o’ ther
candle.’
“ Then I see’d it all. Strike me ded, but I felt
like faintin’ ! ‘ Ho, is it ?’ I yelled. ‘ Enuf o’ y’
an’ yer doctor’s tricks. Outev this y’ go—quick.
Git! ’ I trew ’im out on ’is ’ead among the jam-
tins an’_ empty bottles, an’ ’eaved ’is fernitcher on
top of ’im. Then I rushed back to the ’ut to kill
the dyin’ man. I wuz mad. ’E lay shiverin’ wi’
fright in ’is bunk, an’ when I come in ’e gives a
pitiful sorter groan, an’ muttered ‘ Good-a-bve,
dear ole mate, I’m goin’.’
“ ‘ Y’are !’shrieked I; ‘y’re goin’ ter git up
an’ work. Wadjer mean by polin’ on me like so ?
Git up an’ fight, y’ pointer.’ It wuzn’t till I
give ’im a soul-shiftin' kick that ’e saw ther game
wuz up. ’E rose slowly, an’ passed ’s ’and acrost
’is fat face, like ’e wuz dazed. ‘ I feel a little
better now,’ ’e sed, wi’ a sad sorter smile.
“ ‘ Wait till I’ve finished wi’ y’,’sed I. ‘’Ere
’ave I bin graftin’ like a ’en on a china egg, while

Had no appetite, and could not sleep. Read what
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla did for Mr. Marsden, whose
portrait and letter we publish below:
w
m
>‘l was in a very weak condition, had
no appetite, and could not sleep. After
trying several so-called cures, I began
with Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, and it did me
SQ much good that I took, in all, ten
bottles. It was the cheapest in the end,
as it cured me entirely. I now make it
a practise to take three or four bottles
daring the year, and it keeps me in good
working order. I can honestly recom-
mend it to other like sufferers, as I feel
sure it will cure them as it did me.”—
.Hon Aon Mabsden, Adelaide, S. A.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla has been
tried and tested in every way;
and there is nothing like using an old, reliable, and effective
medicine. Intelligent people do not like to experiment.
It is too dangerous. Unknown and untried medicines
often work more serious results than the disease. When
you need a Sarsaparilla, get “AYER’S,” for it is the old-
est, strongest, and best Sarsaparilla you can buy. Hold
fast to the kind that has been tested for 60 years. For
purifying the blood, strengthening the digestion, and brac-
ing up the whole nervous system, use

A BOON TO THE BILIOUS.
Are you compelled to deny yourself many

you bilious ? Do you know that your condition

suffering from a bilious attack, take

PI LLS
and all annoying symptoms will soon disappear.
They settle the stomach, regulate the liver and
exercise the bowels. Their good effects are felt
immediately.
Beecham’s Pills mingle with the
contents of the stomach, and make easy work
of digestion. The nourishing properties of the
food are then readily assimilated, and the
residue carried off without irritating the
intestines or clogging the bowels.
BEECH AM’S PILLS
should be taken whenever there is sick headache,
furred tongue, constipation, sallow skin, or any
symptoms that indicate an inactive liver.
