FACTS!
The only type of
circulation tHat
has real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

Markets are People

»f
Queensland, as a market, Is therefore
its 950,000 people, collected in fami-
lies throughout the State.
It would seem a difficult task to
fmd a common bond between all the
varied interests of these people
a market-place where mer-
chant and client may meet.
Yet there is such a market place
■ . . there is a common bond be-
tween all the varied interests . . .
the daily newspaper.
Through it you can reach the fami-
lies ... the 950,000 people that
make up the Queensland market.
A market too, that has thrown off
the threes of depression and is now
well advanced along the road to
orosperity.
Deliver your advertising messages
into the homes of these people, and
you will find a ready response. Let
The Courjer-Mail carry the story
of youi merchandise into more than
62,000 homes throughout Queens-
land
Make the columns of The Courier-
Mail the market-place of the
250,000 people who dwell in these
homes. . . . Make each family
circle a market-place.
No other Queensland newspaper
Daily or Sunday—can deliver your

ket of so many people . . . can
render such a service at so low a

HIS BOOKS
Literature for the Home
According to the “S. M. Herald,”
Confessions as to their taste in literature
were made by three well-known women at
the Bush Book Club’s annual meeting.
Two said they liked thrillers best; the
third “owned up to a partiality for the
most sentimental of love stories.”
It confirms The Bulletin’s view that
the talkies do no harm. Whether talkies
which specialise in crime and love are
worth going to, and whether novels on
the same themes are worth reading, is
another matter. Most readers of intelli-
gence object to such works, not because
they bear no relation to life, but because
they are dull. They divide up into a few
groups, and each is like every member
of its group. Consider a batch which
was unloaded on The Bulletin a few
days ago.
Murder ( U.K .)
Of the thousands of thrillers which
appear in London year by year, about
75 p.c. are Edgar Wallace models. The
villain ? has a pseudonym like “The
Ringer,” he is pursued and bowled
out by a public-school product (prefer-
ably an old Etonian) who belongs to the
best clubs and gets his clothes in Savile
Row. No malefactor has been brought
to book in the history of English crime-
detection by an amateur sleuth who was
educated at a grammar school and
clothed by Austin Reed.
Sydney Horler, author of Secret Agent
(Collins ; Dymock’s ; 7s. 6d.), has written
over 40 thrillers. “Bunny” Chipstead is
the hero of this one.
Garbed in a dinner-suit over which
Halter, his tailor, had expended loving
care, he scanned the menu at the Savoy
Restaurant and told himself he was en-
titled to an hour or so of leisure.
Even as he was approving of the
crevettes dressees to a fawning maitre
d’hotel and sipping a glass of Royal
Amoroso, he realised that “The Dis-
guiser” was watching him from the
other side of the room. “The Dis-
guiser” (made up to look like a clergy-
man) was dining with the deposed
Maharajah of Kudapore and M. Kirin-
shinsky, of the Soviet Embassy. The
chief murder had occurred, as usual, in
Chapter I. “Bunny’s” job was not merely
to avenge it, but to prevent “The Dis-
guiser” from blowing up the Rock of
Gibraltar. How the master criminal im-
personated first Lord Poynder, the Secre-
tary of State for Foreign Affairs, and then
Major-General Sir Bartley Kerr, C.M.G.,
D. 5.0., Governor of the Rock, and was
dropped by a revolver-shot from
“Bunny” in the nick of time, is explained
in the penultimate chapter.
Death Meets the King’s Messenger
(Bles; Angus and Robertson ; 7s. 6d.)
is by Gilbert Collins, author of “The
Dead Walk” and “Horror Comes to
Thripplands.” The corpse having materi-
alised in Chapter I, Hugh Carding (“a
tall, blonde fellow in a superbly-fitting
dinner-jacket”) is revealed at the Surete
Generate interviewing a suspect.
. “I’m assoomin’ there is a photo, of you
in the old ancestral home?”
“Plenty. But how the devil do you
know my address? And why all this doubt
about my identity?”
“My dear old thing, you float down from
heaven on to the Seine et Oise Depart-
ment with a story about as plausible as
Sinbad and the Roc, and the local authori-
ties are naturally suspicious.”
The law-abiding characters, including a
nice girl, tear about in cars and ’planes,
are captured, stunned, threatened with
revolvers and chained up in cellars while
Carding prattles Bertie Woosterisms in
various parts of England and France.
Then Kurtz, Vassilievitch and the rest
are rounded up, and the possessor of the
dazzling brain which caused their down-
fall issues his instructions to the young
man who has won the girl.
“At my caravanserai you wait while I
slough this dressy lounge for a tuxedo. We
next proceed to that austere bachelor apart-
ment of yours for you to doll up similiter.
Then, old top, we’re trundlin’ along to the
Ritz for a morsel of somethin’ tasty.”
These English crime-detectors are
really high-spirited schoolboys. Rational
grown-ups do not
use their tortured
jargon; but it is
preferable, any-
how, to the
Bowery lingo
which; is creeping
into the thrillers of a few of the younger
British masters.
Murder (U.S.A .)
American thrillers also make a strong
appeal to snobbery. The principals have
unlimited money, and move in sumptuous
surroundings. Oddly enough, the detec-
tives are often cultivated to the point of
priggishness. Several are famous collec-
tors. They are quiet, drab men, as a
rule. Crafft, of Mignon G. Eberhart’s
Death in the Fog, is typical.
He was a wiry little brown man, with
thick leathery lips and eyes that shone like
topazes and a cane which he hooked
around his hard, leathery brown neck. He
wore pince-nez with tortoise-shell rims and
a wide black ribbon.
This “secretive, incalculable little
brown man who was like a djinn,
very old in evil wisdom, very sly, diaboli-
cally crafty,” is as hard to swallow as
any English detective. One of the few
points in his favor is that he talks adult
English. The style of the average Ameri-
can thriller has none of the easy collo-
quialism of its opposite number in Eng-
land.
Charlotte did not know that because
Jules had a toothache she had never again
to listen for sounds in that dark, silent
house. Charlotte did not know that after
a short time now she would never
again feel fear. The telephone on the desk
began to ring-. It rang sharply, insistently.
In short, Charlotte was murdered.
The murder-novels of the U.S.A. have
more interrogation and less action than
those of England, and they appeal in
other ways to a reader whose mental age
is a little older. Ssfy 16.
Sentimentalism
Most novels of sentiment have the
same characters, and many have the same
plot. Georgette Heyer’s The Convenient
Marriage (Heinemann; 7s. 6d.) is as
stereotyped as a sheik novel. The plot
has been used hundreds of times by
scenario-writers, thousands of times by
novelists. The period is late-eighteenth-
century. Horatia, aged 17, is married to
the stern, handsome, 35-year-old Earl
of Rule. She, poor imbecile, thinks he
doesn’t love her ; he forbears to approach
her, for behind his dissolute ways is a
chivalrous soul, and they have come to
one of those arrangements which are so
common in romances of the sort. If
Freud or Jung had lived in George Ill ’s
lime and had been asked to diagnose
Horatia's trouble, he might have said:
“She is suffering from a heurosis caused
by the failure of the Ego ta deal with
the Libido.” But no one suspects what
is wrong with her; so she makes a sexu-
ally-provocative little pest of herself in
a number of ways, and ends by landing
her husband in a duel with his friend
Lord Lethbridge. One so experienced in
sex matters as Lord Rule would have
brought peace to the home months
earlier; but this is a love story, so it
is not till the second-last page that the
equivalent of a talkie fade-out occurs:
He raised her hand to his lips. “Horry ”
he said. “When I married you there was
another woman in my life. She is not
there now, my darling, and in my heart
she never had a place.”
“Oh, M-Marcus, put m-me there,”
Horatia said on a sob.
X OU u are t h erc ’” he answered, and
caught her up in his arms and kissed her,
not gently at all, but ruthlessly, crushing
all the breath out of her body.
The osculation continues overleaf, and
is still in progress when the reader
reaches, figuratively speaking, for his hat
and coat.

ously by Douglas Creditites is What
Everybody Wants to Know About

eight other “Economists from Oxford”

When you dissolve a Hudson’s Eumenthol Jujube
in the mouth you render the mouth and throat
absolutely antiseptic and definitely prevent any
possibility of germ infection of the throat, chest

of the plutocratic octopus. They dis-
cuss, lucidly and in most instances very
fairly, the structure and problems of the
world’s financial system, with special re-
ference to the developments during the
depression. They are not pontifical. One
of them truthfully says “Economics is
an inexact, non-experimental science, and
in it ‘sweet reasonableness’ is particu-
larly necessary.” All seem to be agreed
that the economic problems of the day,
being immensely complex, are not sus-
ceptible of any quick and simple solu-
tion.
The most interesting section to most
readers will be the discussion of the
panaceas put forward by Douglas, Soddy,
Gesell and Eisler. The writer who
analyses Major Douglas’s contentions —
it’s a very thorough analysis—riddles the
A+ B theorem. He concludes that “the
popularity of the Douglas view is in all
probability to be explained through its
ambiguity and complexity.” No other
economic reformer, it is averred, has “that
defensive weapon against rational criti-
cism—the ambiguous statement —so per-
fectly at hand, so efficiently controlled.”
And in conclusion it is complained that
“the critic must, to the end, remain in
difficulties, fighting not only dogma but
obscurity. It is not only for his convic-
tion but also for his methods that Major
Douglas must be regarded as a religious
rather than a scientific reformer.”
Kinder treatment is meted to Prof.
Soddy’s obsession that the creation of
“fictitious loans” by banks is the root of
all monetary evils, but the conclusion is
that he hasn’t developed his case in a
scientific manner and that his objections
are moral rather than economic. Gesell’s
plan to make money perishable, reducing
its value by a certain small percentage
each week to ensure its prompt circula-
tion, is approved as “a policy for a de-
pression”—an instance is given where it
was tried in a small community and
worked well—but it is added that cur-
rency is relatively unimportant com-
pared with bank money. Dr. Eisler’s
plans for stabilising the income of con-
sumers by the creation of two sorts of
currency—“bank money,” which is to be
a stable standard, and “current money,”
which increases in purchasing power as
prices rise—are rejected on the ground
that it has not been shown that booms
and slumps could be thereby avoided.
For the rest the book gives a clear
account of the working of banking and
exchange and other main technicalities
of private and national finance ; com-
ments that Roosevelt’s national-recovery
programme will accumulate opposition in
precisely the degree to which it succeeds
in restoring confidence among business-
men, and, in quite the weakest chapter,
'urveys the problems connected with the
nationalisation of banking.

The Art of E. H. Shea
In The Sculpture of Rayner Hoff E. H.
Shea, of the Sunnybrook Press, Sydney,
has turned out a masterpiece of its almost
oppressively expensive kind. The book is
limited to 100 copies, each of which is
signed by the four contributors ; the price
is £3 35., and every copy has been sold.
Many have gone overseas to eclectics
like Sir William Rothenstein.
Though there are only a few copies in
any one Australian city, the work is of
great public interest; it is for a very
long, if not for all, time, and in every
generation it will be studied by tens of
thousands who don’t own a copy. The
format will show future ages what Aus-
tralia was capable of in the first half of
the twentieth century in the way of print-
ing and photography (or rather collo-
graphy: the process used here has a
gelatine base, giving an intense range of
blacks and whites with every graduation
of intermediate tone); and the critical
estimates are valuable for the lights they
cast on contemporary taste. The con-
tributors are Lord Beauchamp, Messrs.
Howard Ashton and W. B. Dailey, and
Dr. Temple Smith.
They seem to agree about the super-
lative quality of at least one of Sydney’s
four chief monuments: Lord Beauchamp
calls it “the sublime recumbent of Lam-
bert in the Basilica.” Lord Beauchamp
thinks the Archibald Memorial “a fine
example of the commonplace.” On the
other hand, he writes of the Anzac
Memorial :
Here, then, in Sydney will stand splendor
worthy of the heroism it commemorates.
Mr. Dailey is less enthusiastic.
The Memorial is not set forth as a
momentous factor in the sum of Hoffs
achievement. By comparison with Cromag-
non or Aboriginal Boy it is unimportant.
Dr. Temple Smith considers the Edin-
burgh Memorial “an example of de-
cadence run riot”—though it should be
explained that he doesn’t use “decadence”
in the usual denigratory sense. Lord
Beauchamp writes of this “the best-
known of our Memorials”:
The monument on the Rock at Edin-
burgh has the widest emotional appeal.
It is prodigal. As the cathedral builders
in the dawn of the Renascence invoked
genius in its most diverse forms, so it was
invoked here.... The harmony of the
monument is the measure of its success.
Lord Beauchamp is as provocative as
he is interesting. He remarks that War
Memorials used to be of a religious
nature.
Battle Abbey is an instance. It com-
memorates the triqmph of William the
Conqueror, who dedicated it, “that glory
might be offered up to God.” As Chris-
tianity wanes Memorials change their
character. Many are utilitarian.
But can Christianity be said to be wan-
ing in an age which has seen mighty
cathedrals go up in Westminster and
Liverpool? And could anything have
been more utilitarian than Battle, which
in the eleventh century served as a dole
depot, soup kitchen and hospital for the
part of .Sussex it stood in? Also, could
anything less utilitarian be imagined than
a cenotaph, an Anzac, Edinburgh or
Artillery memorial, or a German gun?
This is a fascinating publication quite
apart from its sumptuous appearance and
beautiful illustrations. Every possessor
of a friend who possesses a copy should
spend an hour or two studying it.
H. S.
Talkiefied Historty
If the sponsors of “The Private Life
of Henry VIII.” want some good pub-
licity they should offer a prize to the
schoolboy who picks most holes in its
history.
Henry was, at the time when Laugh-
ton shows him as a stout and brain-
less lecher with untidy hair, a 6ft. 4in.
tree of a man with a shaven crown, a
face like a cliff and a mighty jaw (see
Luke Hornebolt’s portrait). He was the
best shot in an England when it was
illegal for an archer to practise with a
light arrow at a range under 220 yards,
the kingdom’s champion lance and
Europe’s finest ship architect. His im-
provements in artillery and his revolu-
tionary ideas in warship construction
made the English Navy a fit instrument
to defeat the Armada, and England was
more prosperous under his reign than
under that of any other pre-nineteenth-
century king. He was popular with all
classes because of his firmness with
foreign Powers, and because of his price-
and wage-fixing activities and his estab-
lishment of the principle that every man
had a right to work. He spoke and wrote
four languages fluently, was widely read
and an accomplished musician, and his
temperament was even.
He put up with Katherine of Aragon,
six years his senior, until she had failed
to produce a live male heir at six births.
It was a time when a secure succession
alone seemed likely to save the country
from a return to Wars-of-the-Roses
conditions. Even the Papal legate
wrote that “he was not a man whom
harsh manners and unpleasantness could
provoke; nor could any sane man
believe him to be so infirm of character
that sensual allurements would have led
him to dissolve a connection in which he
had passed his youth without stain or
blemish, and in which he had borne him-
self in his trial so reverently and honor-
ably.”
The females whom he beheaded were
wantons. Katherine Howard confessed
to immorality with servants in her teens,
and if ever a woman deserved behead-
ing it was Anne Boleyn. Anne betrayed
him after he had lavished untold
luxury and attention upon her and had
withstood the resistance of most of his
advisers. She was no flapper either, but
a mature woman of 30, who dragged to
ruin with her half a dozen youngsters,
years her junior.
The Venetian ambassador, who had
no cause to love him, wrote of Henry in
his prime that “in mental accomplish-
ments he seems to have few equals in
the world” ; that he was “courteous and
benign, especially to strangers,” and
“prudent and sage and free from vice.”
There is plenty of other testimony to
his ability, much of it from his enemies ;
but the best is in his own letters.
EL V.
The Modern Australian
Anyone who possesses the requisite
standards of comparison will agree with
“J.D.” (R.P. 30/5/’34) that “our accent
is ‘fixed’ and ‘general,’ and has sound-
nuances which differentiate it from Cock-
ney.” But why has no one yet suc-
ceeded in isolating those herd-characteris-
tics of the Australian by which, generally
speaking, (1) anybody who has visited
Australia can identify an Australian
abroad ; (2) nobody can tell what part of
the Commonwealth he comes from? It
is not altogether the anatomical distinc-
tion of Helen Simpson’s doctor in
“Boomerang,” who “was an Australian
anywhere, at first sight, from any dis-
tance, long head, long legs, long lean
chin.”
Grub-street and Hollywood accept
stock characterisations of the bland in-
scrutability of the Chinese, the myopic
square-headedness of the Teuton, the
vivacity of the Frenchman, the English-
man’s stolidity. Are Dad and Dave to
become traditional puppets of the type-
Australian?
Froude wrote in 1885:
There is not met anywhere in Australia
the slightest symptom of a separate pro-
vincial originality either formed or form-
ing... .they are pure English and nothing
else.
And the Commonwealth “Year Book”
registers officially that
At present the characteristics of the
Australian population, whether physical,
mental, moral or social, are only in the
making, and probably it will not be pos-
sible to point to a distinct Australian type
until three or four generations more have
passed.... The Australian at present is
little other than a transplanted Briton.
Ethnologists say the same thing, in their
own jargon:
They look upon We
As only a .sort of They.
But do They? The converse is certainly
untrue. With the “currency” lads of a
century ago there began an origin of
species quite distinct from “sterling” im-
portations. That “sterling” tone still
rings, even in the writings of such friendly
critics as Tom Clarke and Dr. Wood. The
loud and intellectually “untidy” Aus-
tralian of Humfrey Jordan’s Commander
(R.P. 30/5/’34) is a lineal descendant of
Henry Kingsley’s lanky louts, profane,
expectorating and unashamedly independ-
ent. Exactly the “rough but honest”
pose acquired with his passport by every
travelling Australian, and maintained with
a Puckish whimsicality, to the puzzle-
ment of observers overseas. At home, it
is unnecessary to adopt the pose, and
visitors from abroad record their im-
pressions, according to personal reaction,
of “an uncouth bonhomie” or “colonial
hospitality.”
An American war correspondent in
-1918 admitted his inability to understand
the “mighty efficient casualness” of the
A.I.F. A Scots professor found a “non-
chalant insouciance masking a snake-
headed pertinacity.” S. M. Bruce, at an
Anzac Day dinner in 1928, spoke of “a
certain disreputableness which will never
let us lose our sense of humor, and will
force us on with the job.” Exactly the
humorous disreputableness which strung
an incongruous line of lace-edged
lingerie across a village won in the
bloodiest sector of the Somme (the war
history of the Welsh Regiment records
that “As we marched through that vil-
lage, the men laughed as men seldom
laughed on the Somme in ’16”). The
same disreputable humor changed a
famous N.Q. riot from red revolution to
pot-shots at the post-office clock.
Fixed and general, from Fremantle to
Brisbane, and from Darwin to Adelaide,
all “saying something like ‘wyte’ for
‘wait’ and ‘ahs’ for ‘ours,’ ” there is an
Australian type. But has it come to
stay?

A Satchel of Books
The Home for June is a brides’ num-
ber. It contains photographs of eminent
brides ; examples of furnished flats that
any reasonable bride should be glad to
live in ; illustrations of brides’ dresses ;
aye, and (pace Mr. Creswell O’Reilly
and the Customs Department!) pictures
of brides, actual and potential, in their
-nd-rcl-th-s! The most interesting
feature of the issue is a collection of cari-
catures of movie stars made by George
Finey out of snippings from the “Satur-
day Evening Post” and “Ladies’ Home
Journal.” Why Finey shouldi waste
life’s golden hours over trick stuff of this
kind is a mystery ; but its cleverness has
to be seen to be believed.
A year ago Cecil Roberts wrote Pilgrim
Cottage. Now comes Gone Rustic (Hod-
der and Stoughton ; Angus and Robert-
son ; 7s. 6d.). It tells how he came to
acquire his cottage, and chats about his
life there. He gloats over the thought
that Chaucer and Charles I. may have
ridden past his door, delights in his tulip-
beds—the result of a chance circular
from “a dear old bulb-grower” in Hol-
land—and makes disclosures about sun-
bathing, earthworms and lawn-making
which will be no news to Australian
suburbanites. There are four excellent
color-drawings of the cottage.
The May issue of Manuscripts is an
improvement on its predecessors in most
directions. Margaret E. Davies’s “Con-
temporary French Literature” stands out,
and Don Finley’s “The Russian Theatre”
covers the subject in a series of gasps
(“Independent dog of a serf —wants to
buy his freedom, does he?—wants to
educate his son —a doctor, eh? —Tchehov
grandpere Tchehov pere—Tchehov—
doctor—playwright”) inside a couple of
pages. The format is admirable, as usual,
and there are some interesting wood cuts.

NOBODY WANTS WAR.
Nobody wants war, yet almost every-
body but Mr. Jimmy Thomas, the British
Dominions Secretary, seems to expect it
to happen soon. The fight to prevent
it has almost become a war in itself.
The sharp engagement between M.
Barthou and Sir John Simon at Geneva
had a distinct air of pistols for two ; and
the Disarmament Conference, which has
been dragging on for nearly three years,
seems to regard Mr. Arthur Henderson
as the only bulwark against Armageddon.
Mr. Arthur Henderson thinks so himself.
He says modestly that “he is present as the
guardian of millions of the world’s young
men, whose lives are in our hands.”
Outside the British Empire the world’s
young men are busy with preparations
for looking after themselves or for pre-
venting other people from getting into
mischief. Evidently they don’t share Mr.
Henderson’s opinion.
Mr. Ramsay MacDonald is the head
of the school of pacifists to which Mr.
Henderson belongs. They are great be-
lievers in example. Mr. Thomas, speak-
ing at the reception to the Australian
cricketers, said that when you had a
drink with Mr. MacDonald it was always
ginger-pop, and when you asked him for
a song it was “O God, Our Help in Ages
Past.” The European policy of these
people is an exact adaptation of the Brit-
ish Prime Minister’s private habits: it is
all ginger-pop and trust in the Lord. It
has resulted in the reduction of the Brit-
ish Navy and the British Army and the
restriction of the British Air Force, while
almost every other country which might
be a menace has been allowed to increase
its army, navy and air force. Except,
of course, Germany, which is doing
it whether allowed to or not.
The nations most capable of plunging
the world into war are the U.S.A.,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan and
Russia.
The U.S.A., which is the least likely
to fight of its own volition, is almost the
most heavily armed, and it is adding to its
armaments on an enormous scale. It
plans to spend about 600,000,000 dollars
extra on the navy alone, if other coun-
tries refuse to behave. Which shows how
much Uncle Sam knows about world
wars. The moment his programme be-
gins to take shape, every armaments
manufacturer in the world will be help-
ing other big countries to arm to U.S.A.
standards.
France wants disarmament, but by that
she means the disarmament of Germany
and the drawing of Signor Mussolini’s
claws. The Duce is the only prophet
in Europe who will frankly admit that
war is a human necessity and that his
ambitions are Imperial. He said as much
in 1923, and in August, 1932, he wrote
that
Fascism does not believe that eternal
peace is possible War is the only thing
which develops the drive of humanity to
its maximum Attempts to establish
world peace are doomed to failure.
And in March last he told a Paris
newspaper that he was in favor of alter-
ing the title Disarmament Conference to
“Conference for the Limitation and Pro-
portioning of Armaments.”
Herr Hitler, of course, is for disarma-
ment. He and his supporters issue hun-
dreds of pamphlets about it. They par-
ticularly want to disarm France to a
point which would give them a fair
chance of licking her. Professor Banse.
who interprets their views to stu-
dents, writes in his book, “Germany
Prepares for War,” that an “iron age
lies before us”; that “the day of
grim resolve and cold steel has begun,”
and that, thanks to German effort,
“the sword will come into its own
again.” But, while keeping in office this
peaceful person who discusses in detail
plans for an attack on England, Herr
Hitler says that he has no belligerent in-
tentions. In training millions of men to
march and obey orders, in building secret
aerodromes and defence lines, he is
merely protecting innocent Deutschland.
Of course, he has won the sympathy of
the Ramsay MacDonalds. As Mr. Garvin,
of the London “Observer,” remarks, “we
have irrevocably recognised Germany’s
right to rearm.”
Another interesting peacemaker is M.
Litvinoff, the Russian Foreign Sec-
retary, who thinks the “risk of war
is increasing monthly,” and says the
Soviet’s “original doctrine of the com-
plete abolition of arms” is the only one
which will bring peace. He cried out for
a “disarmed conference.” Every Aus-
tralian worker has heard Soviet emis-
saries preaching against war. But that
means simply that they are against “capi-
talist” and “imperialist” war. The
U.S.S.R. aims at abolishing the defences
of capitalist countries, so that, when
the final class war to establish Commun-
ism is entered upon, Empires must fall
without resistance. The protagonists of
the movement must get a lot of fun out
of hearing U.A.P. women’s organisations
and other loyal societies supporting the
Australian Soviet anti-war movement.
Doubtless the Disarmament Conference
would have had some fun out of M.
Litvinoff, too, if it had recalled that the
13th Plenum of his party executive, held
in January, which he attended, passed
a resolution
obliging all sections of the Communist
International in all countries t 0.... exert
every' effort without losing a moment for
the revolutionary preparation of the prole-
tariat for the impending decisive battles
for power....
It was made clear that the battles would
be real.
M. Litvinoff might have added to the
gaiety of the occasion by reading M.
Voroshilov’s exposition to the meeting
of the U.S.S.R.’s military position—M.
Voroshilov is Minister for Naval and
Military Affairs: —•
We have to-day a fully up-to-date, a
strong, good army ready for battle
This is no mere phrase, but Bolshevik
truth. The Red Army can justly pride
itself on its armaments.... We have a
sufficient number of absolutely up-to-date
tanks and, through mass production, a
fully adequate number of our own good
machine-guns.... Production has started
on new models of guns Our air force
has changed beyond recognition. We have
created a mighty force of heavy bombers.
The mechanised horse-power per man
in the Red Army had increased from 2.6
in 1930 to 7.74, the highest in the world,
in 1934; 50 p.c. of Red Army officers
were also technicians. The navy was
“receiving attention,” and would be made
“into a real powerful workers’ and
peasants’ navy.” At the same time, the
speaker accused Japan of preparing for
war on Russia, and said that “the pro-
posed attack would cost its instigators
dear.” There has been no reported reply
from the Japanese side—unlike these elo-
quent Russian gentlemen, Japanese are
not addicted to making speeches. But
there has never been any reason to sup-
pose that Japanese sea-, land- and air-
power has been neglected.
Apart from the little peoples it would
seem that the only genuine pacifists are
in the British Empire. And the best
specimens are to be found in Aus-
tralia. The Nobel Peace Prize Com-
mittee should not pass over Mr.
Scullin, who will not allow us to defend
ourselves until we can make our arma-
ments here—a thing which his own party
would never let us do on an adequate
scale. And Senator Pearce should not
be overlooked. His habit of acquiring
obsolete destroyers and second-hand
guns, and of allowing the strategic lay-
out of naval oil-supply parks to be shown
on movie screens, as that of the Darwin
oil base is being shown now, makes it
clear that he has illimitable faith in
Providence.
Belligerence toward other countries is
one thing which every Australian desires
to avoid. Prudence is quite another thing.
It is time public opinion bestirred
itself to see that we shall not go like
sheep to the slaughter if world war
breaks out again.
LYONS IN THE PATH?
It was decidedly cool of the U.A.P.
gentlemen who recently foregathered in
Melbourne to reply to Dr. Earle Page’s
offer of an election arrangement, which
was at least a basis for negotiation, with
a counter-proposal for “a complete union
of the two parties and organisations
throughout the Commonwealth”; in
effect, the absorption of the smaller con-
cern by the larger.
The Country party is so much older
than the U.A.P. that it might fairly sug-
gest that it should do the absorbing. It
was in active business when Mr. Lyons
and Mr. Hughes were still Labor poli-
ticians, when Mr. Menzies was dt the
University and Mr. Stevens was a young
Treasury clerk, and when other delegates
to the Melbourne conference, which was
held with the doors closed, were office-
boys. It saw Mr. Hughes dandle the
Nationalist party in his arms in 1917, and
saw him drive his knife into it in 1929.
It was a power before the U.A.P. was
thought of, and may be flourishing when
the U.A.P. is forgotten.
The wording of the Melbourne resolu-
tion implies that Mr. Lyons’s party is
organised throughout the Common-
wealth ; but is it? Queensland supporters
of his Government and opponents
of the Forgan Smith Administration
call themselves Country-Nationalists.
Premier Butler, of South Australia, pro-
fesses to be a Liberal; anyway, his Gov-
ernment is backed by the Liberal Federa-
tion. The organisations behind Mr. Lee
in Tasmania and Mr. Keenan in West-
ralia are not U.A.P. but Nationalist. It
would require some courage to form
U.A.P. groups in W.A. when there are
so many angry secessionists about. And
Victoria has its Young Nationalists,
though it has U.A.P. branches also. In
short, U.A.P. organisation as such is con-
fined to two States, and even there it is
nowhere very strong outside the big
cities.
in any case, the people who keep
parties going are not to be bought and
sold like cattle on the hoof. Officials,
paid and unpaid, and politicians playing
for safety may ready up an amalgama-
tion ; but it is for the rank and file of
both parties to approve or disapprove.
State branches of the Country party have
enjoyed autonomy ever since it arrived.
Their servants would not dare to sign away
its existence without consulting them. If
they were presumptuous enough to try
it, the members would indisputably re-
ject the arrangement they made and
repudiate those responsible for it. The
Bulletin is not so sure that this is true
of members of the U.A.P., but hopes it
is. These politicians with their secret
meetings and these machines with their
preselection (it is regrettable to see the
Victorian C.P. tarnishing an honorable
record) take far too much upon them-
selves.
Three months before a general elec-
tion is no time to be talking about union
of parties and organisations which have
been on unfriendly terms for two years.
Union may be desirable, but if it is to
be fruitful and enduring it should come
about naturally after frank discussions,
and after reference of the outcome to
accredited delegates. All that should be
aimed at now is an arrangement provid-
ing for friendly co-operation in the con-
stituencies and in the next Parliament,
and preserving the rights of both parties
to contest seats which each thinks it can
win. Another Bruce-Page arrangement,
in a word.
The Nationalists under Mr. Bruce and
the Agrarians under Dr. Page pulled
together for seven years. Their alliance
stood the strain of the dismissal of a dis-
contented but highly-regarded C.P.
Minister, and it was beneficial to Aus-
tralia on the whole—though doubtless it
would have been more so if the two
leaders had not arrived new to the game
during a boom of unexampled propor-
tions which most people came to regard
as normal. If they had done nothing
else they would deserve to be remem-
bered with respect for the financial agree-
ment. The U.A.P. and the C.P. both
desire to protect Australia against the
twin perils that menace it—import quotas
abroad and political control of banking
and currency at home. Neither can rule
alone. There is nothing in their pro-
grammes, not even the tariff, that should
prevent a renewal of the 1922-29 agree-
ment. Mr. Bruce could assuredly bring
it about. If Mr. Lyons fails, the fault will
lie with him and his advisers.
GERMANIA, UNLIMITED.
There has been great activity amongst
Nazi propagandists on the subject of
German colonisation. On the inaugura-
tion of the republic this question fell
into abeyance. The old Imperialistic
slogans became disreputable. It was no
longer Germany’s sacred duty to assume
other white men’s burdens; she had
enough to do at home establishing
democracy.
In this respect history was merely re-
peating itself. Good immigrant as
America and Australia have found him,
the German is a very reluctant colonist
under the German flag. The notion
that Germany turned imperialistic too
late to get her fair share in the great
world scramble in the second half of
the nineteenth century is not true. She
arrived in good time amidst the concert
of nations, but Bismarck, a Liberal Free-
trader, for long refused to pipe the
fashionable tune. By 1885 30 volumes
of plans for German overseas expansion
had been pigeon-holed by the Iron Chan-
cellor.
He changed his opinion, learnt the
technique and applied it with resolution.
The great German empire-builder was
Dr. Carl Peters. Peters and two asso-
ciates, disguised as English workingmen,
landed in Zanzibar, crossed over to the
mainland, plunged into the interior and
returned ten days later with a dozen
treaties on which illiterate native poten-
tates had put their marks without know-
ing they had signed away their birth-
right. Bismarck at first dissociated him-
self with righteous indignation from these
conquests, but when they threatened to
be successful and advantageous he con-
firmed them. In the South Seas he
allowed the German missionary to pre-
cede the German trader, and the diplomat
and the navy to follow the trader.
When the Emperor Wilhelm took over
the reins of government he turned the
steady expansion of the Reich into a
grand explosive melodrama, with guns
menacing, flags flapping and ultimatums
creating periodical panics in Foreign
Offices. There was method behind Wil-
helm’s Drury Lane madness. He concen-
trated on the Near and Far East. Far-
seeing projects like the Bagdad railway
were furthered by his Christian Majesty’s
exchange of courtesies on the spot with
his Mohammedan Majesty the Sultan
Abdul Hamid. The murder of some
Catholic missionaries in Shantung aroused
his Protestant indignation, which could
only be assuaged by the lease of two
hundred square miles of Chinese terri-
tory on a 99-year tenure, the area in-
cluding one of the finest ports in China.
His Majesty proceeded to erect a first-
class naval base, no doubt to protect
future missionaries from further attacks
by Chinese savages. Moreover, he
ordained that a Chinese province with a
population larger than that of Italy was
to be an economic sphere of influence
for Germany ; in other words, a colony.
Despite all this fuss and bother, what
did Geimany’s colonial empire amount
to at its apogee? Between 1884 and 1914
she obtained, at considerable expense and
at the risk of European wars, territories
which, though large in extent, failed
miserably to attract the younger sons
of German families. Just before
Armageddon the number of Germans
in German colonies was 23,952, not
a twentieth of her annual increase, and
just about equal to the number which
had emigrated to America in the two
years 1912-13. Her trade with her
colonies was little more than 2 p.c. of
her total trade. The notion that the
Fatherland needed these colonies to
insure a supply of raw materials was
pure illusion. The vast bulk of such
supplies came from Australia, the Argen-
tine, Malaya and other lands over which
she had no political control.
What is the basis, then, of the Teutonic
thirst for colonies? It is partly psycho-
logical, the expression of national mega-
lomania, and partly political. It is
certainly not the product of any innate
capacity for bringing the blessings of
civilisation to the heathen. General
Goering, the Nazi Prime Minister of
Prussia, recently claimed that “the
natives loved us, were faithful to
us and took a pride in achieve-
ments under German leadership. ’ The
evidence of the Hereros of South-west
Africa might be worth taking. The Ger-
man endeavor to establish white cattle
ranches worked by native labor resulted
in the Hereros, deprived of their tribal
lands, rebelling in 1904. This revolt and
others Were suppressed at a cost of 600
million marks, 5000 German lives and
the extermination of more than half of
the Herero population.
The Nazis’ renewal of the claim for
a place in the sun for Germany is thus
not the plea of a starving man for a
share of the rich banquet being wolfed
by a lot of greedy rivals. It is an arti-
ficial appetite created for political pur-
poses by propaganda.
FENG-SHUI.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Chain Stores and Employment.
It would be hard to find a system
which reacts more alarmingly against
Australian living standards than that of
the chain store.
For one thing, chain stores have turned
selling into a mechanical act. It calls
for no persuasion ; the assistant’s part
consists in handing packets over the
counter and collecting the money.
No counterhand under .such a system
can be expected to feel any pride in the
work. It is so simple that any untrained
child can do it.
In N. S. Wales undiluted female labor
is permitted by the law, and 50 per cent,
of a chain-store staff may be juniors.
Children under 15 years can be hired for
9s. 6d. a week to stand up all day in a
whirling crowd handing out cheap stuff,
competing only too successfully with Aus-
tralian articles which their fathers might
be making. At 15 their emoluments must
soar to 12s. 6d. per week. A year later
they must have £1 os. 9d. per week. Still
another year later the wage goes up
to £1 ss. 9d. At 19 it is £1 11s. per
week ; at 20, £1 14s. 6d.
And every year a chain-store girl faces
the risk of the sack upon her birthday
and replacement by some cheaper drudge
of tenderer years.
In one chain store visited by a Bulletin
man there were 170 girl employees and
10 men ; in another, 180 girls and 20
men.
No doubt, there are chain stores with
softhearted directors, but from the look
of things benevolence is extended much
more to the shareholders than to the
staff. It can scarcely make softhearted
directors comfortable to reflect that
they can hire a child to do 52-weeks’
work for less than a year’s dividend on
an investment of £lOO at a time when
the earning power of money is not nor-
mally high.
The Commonwealth and State Gov-
ernments should investigate the position
thoroughly and act resolutely where
action is required.

Surplus R.A.N. Officers.
At the beginning of last month the Min-
ister for Defence made an attempt in
The Bulletin to justify his department’s
treatment of the late Lieut.-Commander
Casey. Last week he tried again on
similar lines in the “S. M. Herald.”
Some differences were that his language
was more ambiguous, and that the re-
sponsibility was shifted to “the chief
medical adviser of the Naval Board,”
who is said to have “recommended the
invaliding of Casey from the service.”
The adviser referred to is not a special-
ist, and had had no opportunity of
examining or so much as talking to
Casey for at least two years. A Mac-
quarie-street specialist did examine Casey
for the department a few days before the
officer was dismissed. He swore at the
inquest as follows:
I could find no sign of organic disease.
The “anxiety state” was no longer evident.
It is a matter of surprise to me that he
was discharged as being below the navy
standard.
The Bulletin’s original charge against
the department (and, whatever paper
Senator Pearce gives a statement to, it is
The Bulletin he is trying to answer) was
not only that Lieut.-Commander Casey
had been irregularly discharged, but that
he had been bilked of his compensation
money. When Casey had his breakdown
at Greenwich, and offered to retire, it
was obvious that he was suffering from
the terrific strain of his special advanced
(w./t.) course there. In the circum-
stances he would have had to be com-
pensated. The Naval Board wrote that
it recognised his desire to help the
naval authorities as regards the problem
of surplus officers, but it implored
him to remain in the service. He was
regarded, the board said, as “a very
valuable officer.” All the letters are
available.
Senator Pearce disposed of this episode
in the “S. M. Herald” in the following
disingenuous manner:
The Naval Board, in accordance with
its policy of retrenchment, invited officers
to volunteer to retire, and Lieut.-Com-
mander Casey, then abroad, volunteered.
The Naval Board communicated with him
through its representative in London,
and received a reply asking to be allowed
to cancel his application to resign. This
the Naval Board approved.
The principle involved is of tremendous
importance to the R.A.N. It has been
recognised at the Navy Office for some
time that by 1936 or earlier the ques-
tion of surplus officers, already acute,
will be insoluble on existing lines. The
Government can bump its officers out
irregularly as “below naval standard”;
then say that the officers’ alleged dis-
abilities had nothing to do with their
work, and use that as an excuse to refuse
them compensation. It can compensate
them, and incur the hostility of pacifists
who begrudge every penny spent on
defence. Or it can make use of their
high mental, moral and physical quali-
fications in shore jobs and incur the
hostility of the Public Service Associa-
tion. The Bulletin submits that the
first alternative is unthinkable; that the
second alternative may be impracticable
in the present state of our finances ; and
that the third would be implemented
without delay if the Government had
any regard for defence morale.
Even at this late stage, the department
should save face and allay the uneasi-
ness in the R.A.N. by compensating
Casey’s relations. It is up to Mr. Lyons.

Hush, Not a Word!
Every politician will condole with W.
M. Hughes on the miscarriage of the
scheme to keep his address to the
Douglas Credit Association at St. Leon-
ards a secret. On their blood or a bottle
of tomato sauce or something, the high
contracting parties swore that no word
he might say should be contaminated by
press mention. Lots of people in North
Sydney do not approve of Douglas. Mr.
Hughes wants their votes, but he also
wants those of the young lions and
artists of Douglas Credit; and to get
their support he was apparently willing
to go half-way with them so long as they
did not tell anybody about it. Unfor-
tunately, Granny “Herald” disguised her-
self as an aspidistra and heard it all.
Mr. Hughes, it now appears, is a
Douglasite to the extent that he agrees
with the Major about the causes of the
depression. But he does not admit that
the remedy proposed by that projector is
the right one, and he tells the Douglasites
that if they want to carry it into effect
they must first convert a majority of the
people.
Mr. Hughes believes this because he
is “still as much a Labor man as he was
when he joined the Labor party.” If he
thinks that even a majority vote could
put Douglasism into operation without
bringing about a national crash, he is as
credulous as he was when he used to
believe the stories of Hans Andersen.
Anyway, the meeting was obviously
right in telling him that he did not un-
derstand the system. Most people will
also agree, after reading the report, with
the dictum of his old friend J. H. Thomas,
who said: “You know, Billy, democracy
would be all right if it were not for the
democrats.” Mr. Hughes is one of the
democrats.

Exit W. A. Holman.
From an old friend: —-
It was difficult to believe that W. A. Holman
was 63. Even in his later years of sickness
and disillusion he held to a buoyantly youth-
ful. outlook. He was always an idealist, and
he cared more for the manner of a perform-
ance than for the performance itself. He once
called himself a “leftover from the Elizabethan
age,” and mourned the fact that all his fencing
practice (he was an adept with the foils) went
for nothing. “Surely,” said somebody present,
“surely you are not bloodthirsty, Bill? Whom
would you like to fight?”
“First,” said Holman dreamily, “I should
tackle Billy Hughes, because he is smaller than
I am, and then- I should take on Jim Page
[then the biggest member of the Reps.], because
I couldn’t miss him.”
Holman loved a good book more for its
finished argument or style than for the meat in
it. He loved politics because of the mental
fencing practice which they gave him. He liked
speaking to a hostile audience for the play
which the exercise gave his wits. And the law
appealed to him because he looked on it as
a game full of nicety and skill in which the
swiftest-moving and most adroit player had
the best chance.
Though his Governments steeped themselves
in practical socialism, he delighted most in
the development of public amenities. Taronga
Park was one of his brainwaves, and he it was
who planned Verbrugghen’s orchestra and
made it a reality. It was an axiom with him
that there would never be great stable parties
in politics in Australia until there was a
leisured political class free to think in terms
of philosophy and principle, and he used to
say this with glee in a complicated way to
some of his most materialistic colleagues, who
could never understand what he was driving at.
He cared little for money and was generous
with his friends. He used to say sadly that
he was the wrong man for deputations to see,
because “anybody can get anything out of
me.” At the same time, he could be an im-
placable fighter who cared nothing for man
or devil when his dander was up—as Sir
Gerald Strickland learnt to his cost —and
nobody of his political period was so clever
at getting out of difficulty.
In later years, the fight died out of him a
good deal, but he was still an adroit and
eloquent counsel. During his term in Can-
berra he was a sick man. As he put it
himself: “Politics don’t seem what they were.
The color seems to have been bleached out
of them.”
If not the greatest of N. S. Wales Premiers,
he was among the most colorful of them, and
nobody who held it ever loved the office more.
One of his pleasures was to sit with a friend
over a quiet cup of tea or whisky-and-soda on
the little balcony outside the Premier’s room
and then, unobserved by the street, observe
its personalities. But I don’t think he would
enjoy it now. The Premier’s office has become
a bustling place, and he hated flurry.

The Poor Charity-monger.
“Retired Mendicant”: I think it is
hard and cruel the way The Bulletin
pursues the promoters of the N.S.W.
Golden Chest “art unions.” How diffi-
cult it is for them to keep going is shown
by the following letter circulated to
country newspapers:
In an effort to help the hospital, Mr.
W. H. Whiddon, as honorary director of
the Golden Chest, is giving the whole of
the profits from his fifth lottery shares to
the hospital and charities benefiting by the
Golden Chest.
In an effort to get subscribers, I am
anxious to advertise in your paper, but,
because every shilling means such a lot to
the hospital at present, cannot pay adver-
tising rates.
Would you, sir, consider payment by
barter, i.e., payment for space taken by
means of lottery shares? It is suggested
that this space be taken and that fifth
lottery shares to the value of £5 be sent
to you.
This is heartrending. The Golden
Chest was advertised to be in aid of the
Community Hospital, the St. Margaret’s
Hospital, the Dalwood Health Home and
the Food for Babies’ Funds. The balance
sheets of these organisations show that
their total expenditures last year were
about £16,000, and that there was a
working surplus on that amount.
They have since had a monopoly of
big “art-union” business, which they
have carried on without regard for im-
portant regulations. They have held
three “art unions” and have permission
to hold another. In one quoted
they sold £32,489 worth of tickets,
and their main expense should have
been £5270 in prize-money. In the other
two, sales exceeded the figure quoted.
They should, therefore, have received over
£BO,OOO in cash from lotteries alone,
against their normal £16,000 p.a. in ex-
penditure.
I can’t help wondering whether the
owners of the palatial office floor which
the concern occupies in an expensive
Sydney building take their rent out in
lottery shares, and whether salaries are
paid in the same medium.

Truth in Criticism.
A leader in the “S. M. Herald” last
week asked what was to be done about
talkies which “must tend to lower the
tone of the community.”
Parents naturally hesitate to deprive
their children of one of the most varied
of modern pleasures, but one way to a
remedy is at least in their hands. They
can forbid attendance at the cinemas, or
select those which offer the minimum of
corruption—but who can tell beforehand?
The obvious answer, as regards Sydney,
is the “S. M. Herald.” Equally obviously
it rarely does tell. One of the most
blithely corrupt pictures that Australia
has seen is “Should Ladies Behave?”
The principal thrill occurs when a doll-
faced child lures an elderly beauty-actor
into a playhouse where she keeps her
toys, and asks him to seduce her. It
might be expected that the “S. M.
Herald” would have warned its readers
that “Should Ladies Behave?”, while
excellent entertainment for those who
like Palais Royale farces and the jokes
of “Le Rire,” was unsuitable for Boy
Scouts and Girl Guides. Not at all. All
it took serious exception to was the
ungenteel behavior of the girl’s father
when he gets himself and her boy-lover
a scratch meal in the kitchen.
Mr. Barrymore carries uncouthness too
far when he gnaws bones, swills his coffee
in his mouth, and picks his teeth.
The “S. M. Herald” published a letter
in which the writer complained that part
of “The Private Life of Henry VIII.”
had been cut out.
While it admittedly sailed rather close
to the wind, it was certainly the funniest
part of the whole film, and there was not
the faintest suspicion of coarseness or
grossness.
In point of fact, judged by the standards
applied by the “S. M. Herald” to the
other film, practically the whole of
“Henry VIII.” is coarse, gross, uncouth
or any other adjective that may be in-
spired by what Bejetman calls “ghastly
good taste.” It is also bawdy to a degree.
The Bulletin doesn’t believe that the
spectacle of Mr. Laughton creeping after
women in passages or “carrying un-
couthness too far” at the dining-table is
capable of doing a ha’porth of damage
to the morals of young Australians. Aus-
tralian morals are no better than those
of England, which has never had an
O’Reilly to guard its purity. Some papers,
however, think differently. All they need
do is to publish the truth. Four-fifths
of the scandalised yelps which are heard
from time to time in respect of porno-
graphic novels and talkies arise, from the
discovery by Puritans that the works are
quite different from what the newspaper
critics said they were.

Greeks and Their Friends.
“D.E.”: The wrongs of “Cosmos” (B.
6/6/’34) leave me cold. He was charged
2s. 9d. for a hotel lunch which he had
expected to get for 25., and, though lager
is Is. 3d. a bottle over the counter, he
had to pay 9d. for a glass brought to his
table, his notion apparently being that
service should be free. “Profiteering!”
he shrieks ; adding that “a precisely similar
lunch can be got at an adjacent Greek
establishment for Is. 3d.” Mere assertion,
and I take leave to doubt it, especially
as at my last visit to a Greek shop six-
pence was demanded for a small glass
of malted milk, the price a few doors up,
for more and better, being fourpence.
Obviously “Cosmos” has a weakness
for Greeks. His preference is shared by
a great many Australians ; hence the fact
that no country town of any size is with-
out its Greek restaurant —generally the
most prosperous eating joint in the place.
Cookitdersnap has a great advantage over
the publican who serves meals, inasmuch
as his trading hours are unlimited. Also,
if he goes through the form of handing
Demetrius and Pisistratus award wages
and takes back 50 or 60 p.c. for Venize-
los or Constantine’s family, how is the
union or the Government inspector to
know? I never heard of a hotelkeeper
providing “businessmen’s lunches” being
fined for having a filthy backyard or a
kitchen in which maggots feast on what
the rats and mice have left. Cookitder-
snap has a virtual monopoly of these
cases. What the one eye of “Cosmos”
doesn’t see his heart needn’t grieve over ;
still, I doubt whether it would be to the
ultimate advantage of the brewing and
wine-making industries to let his Hellenic
protege have the license which “Cosmos”
would give him.
“Cosmos” doesn’t mention the name or
situation of the pub in which bang went
ninepence. My experience is that you
can get a better lunch in Australian hotels
for 2s. or 3s. and a better dinner for
4s. or 5s. —better food and better cook-
ing—than you can get in London for
the same money. I refer particularly to
places like the Metropole, the Grand
Central and Adams’s in Sydney, and
Alexander’s and Carlyon’s in Melbourne.
One thing I grant: ales and wines served
at meals are too dear. But the politicians
are chiefly to blame. The State politi-
cians who compel hotelkeepers to close
their bars at 6 p.m. —which for six
months of the year is merely afternoon —
and the Commonwealth politicians who
impose terrific customs and excise duties
on alcoholic beverages. “In France you
can get a bottle of sound wine or a carafe
of beer for three francs, with the franc
standing at 2d.” Why, the Common-
wealth charges the equivalent in excise
alone.
AN ENLARGED “BULLETIN.”
Since January 31, 1880, “The Bulletin” has tried to mirror the life of
its times and the preoccupations of its readers.
To cater for current interests, it now takes a new step forward. From
June 20 onwards, it will be permanently a 52-page paper in which special
pages will be devoted to motoring, radio and bridge.
Motoring will be in the hands of Mr. Fred Berry, known as race-driver
and engineer. Mr. Don Knock, one of the wireless pioneers, will deal with
radio. Dr. Tonkin, one of the leading contract players in the Commonwealth,
will attend to the bridge page.
Existing features will remain, and there will be more illustrations,
embodying the best work of the best Australian black-and-white artists—
Norman Lindsay, Scorfield, Townsend, Finey, Frith, Aria, Miller, Johnston,
Stephens and Percy Lindsay among them.


Society
“AND IT'S DRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKD"
“Strict Veg.”: A lone woman stand-
ing up for her rights always enlists the
sympathy of a warmhearted people.
Such a one is Mrs. Mott, a Horsham (Vic.)
widow who became engaged to Deering
Charles Beddison, a well-to-do retired
grazier, aged 81. Last March, when
Mrs. Mott was about to step into a
church-bound motor-car, the door
slammed and the car and the prospective
husband disappeared into the blue. No-
thing daunted, the widow moved into
the Beddison house with her family, and
thence issued a writ claiming dam-
ages for breach of promise. The bride-
groom, however, could not be found.
He had properties in various parts of the
State, and it was alleged that relations
were whisking him about from one to
the other at such a rate that the post-
man couldn’Pkeep up with him. After
various legal manoeuvres, the writ was
delivered in his absence, and the enemy
capitulated to the extent of a settlement
out of court. The lady has now an-
nounced that she will evacuate the
invaded territory and retire to a Mel-
bourne suburb.
* * * $
“Chevrot'ord”: The Salvation Army is
noted for its faith in Providence, but it
permits itself reservations as regards
Melbourne motorists, apparently. In its
journey from the citadel to a stand in
Bourke-street on foggy nights, one de-
voted band always carries a tail-light of
the regulation color.
* * * *
“Old Unionist”: Caring a great deal
about power but nothing for money,
W. A. Holman sacrificed a good deal
for politics. He never forgot a friend,
and had an extraordinary number of
pensioners for a man who was never
really affluent. Holman inherited his
histrionic ability from his father, merely
applying it in a new direction. He pro-
vided the campaign brains for Labor long
before he reached personal leadership,
but his capacity for Parliamentary
strategy aroused constant uneasiness and
distrust amongst his followers. “We’re
going to tie Holman down,” was often
whispered before a conference; but
gatherings that assembled to attack him
frequently finished by cheering him after
he had explained his views. Holman’s
delight in subtlety was probably his worst
handicap.
* * * *
“El V.”: The Duke of Gloucester will
stay at two of the most stately homes in
N. S. Wales —Camden and Edinglassie.
The former, an old white, late-Georgian-
style manor, with an eighteenth-century
air which belies the date of its erection
in the middle ’thirties, was the successor
of an earlier house on the property and
of Elizabeth Farm at Parramatta, the
original Macarthur dwelling, which is
now the oldest standing building in Aus-
tralia. John Macarthur did not live to
occupy Camden Park; Edinglassie is a
large Scottish-looking pile which could
be turned into a fortalice without much
trouble. Colonel Jim White, its host, is
one of the leading Aberdeen Angus'
breeders of Australia, a tall, gentle, un-
assuming Light Horseman, every inch an
Australian. He is Jim White the fourth.
The original one was an employee of
the A.A. Company as early as 1827;
he married a daughter of Hoddle, the
surveyor who planned Melbourne. Jim
White the second was born at Stroud
(N.S.W.) in ’2B, and by the late ’sixties
the family had a long string of stations,
largely acquired from the Wentworths —
Martindale, Edinglassie, Belltrees, Dal-
morton and Narran Lake. Then they
bought Segenhoe, where in an earlier day
Potter McQueen had lived like a Scottish
baron. In later years their interests spread
to North Queensland and the N.T., where
“Stop that ridiculous bobbing up and down and tell me how I look.”
they still own Brunette. There is a big
clan of Whites to-day. Australian nature
study owes much to one of the family
—the late Squire of Belltrees, who was
also Australia’s greatest stamp-collector.

‘Molar”: How’s this for optimism?
Recently I accepted a lift from a lady
driver in a particularly old and rickety
car. Nearing a railway crossing she
sounded the horn vociferously. There
was a clear view in both directions, and
I remarked that there was no train in
sight. “I like to be on the right side,”
she assured me ; “then, if you do hit the
train, they can’t do anything to you.”

“Keg”: There are headaches in the
Department of Road Transport over the
new R-type tramcar installed in Sydney.
While the innovation is a delight to the
eye and graded A 1 by the conductors,
it is hopelessly inadequate for its job
of carrying passengers ; in effect, a 48-
seater car has displaced an old 100-seater
coupled set. The caravans are just as
expensive to run, as two conductors have
to be on the job most of the journey.
Also, congestion in King-street, due to
overloading, has made it next to impos-
sible to run the departmental timetable.
We lowbrows in the union expect that
those responsible for the type will get
an increase in salary, and that the
department will approach the Court for
another decrease in wages.

“Retired Thug”: “S.T.S.” thinks the
bound-and-gagged bank-clerk, idea has
moved up (B. 6/6/’34), but if he knew
my friend Mr. Chatterjee, B.Com. (Lon-
don), he would regard the S. Aus. tech-
nique as crude. Mr. C., unlike his imitator
in “S.T.S.’s” State, had dishonest designs
on the strong box in the office where he
worked. He removed it, repaired to the
house of a well-known thief and scat-
tered incriminating papers in the com-
pound ; broke into the poor burglar’s
dwelling and removed his pet bowie
knife and slippers ; returned to his own
office and walked across a wet verandah
in the stolen slippers, which he then con-
signed to the Jumna, and, finally, after
rigging the evidence of a terrific struggle,
pinned himself to the table with" the
thief’s snickersnee. He awaited discovery
with extra equanimity because he had 16
friends and relatives suborned to swear
that they had seen the villain upon whom
the guilt was to be saddled bearing away
the booty. The latter, however, spoiled
this excellent plan. He chose that after-
noon to get rid of one of his mothers-
in-law, and, having been caught in the
act, had a perfect alibi. He was attached
to a ring in a gaol wall when the rob-
bery was committed. Mr. Chatterjee was
very indignant with the law for what it
did to him afterwards.

“Barangkali”: “Double Disc” takes
“Jeviel” to task (B. 30/5/’34) for his
statement regarding the “white” bursts
from Archie batteries, stating that the
nearest to white he had seen was the
dirty grey wisps from the Mills bomb.
An extract from the “British Official
History” should settle that question.
British anti-aircraft guns now opened
fire on the German ’planes, and the charac-
teristic white bursts of their shells
attracted the attention of Captain Brown,
who, although he could distinguish no
enemy ’planes, knew that they must be
there and signalled his formation to
follow him towards the fleecy shellbursts.
* * * *
“YVandana”: A few years back the
Victorian Government constructed a
railway about 30 miles off the Mildara
line at a cost of £30,000 or so. No
train has yet run on it, but travel-
lers passing through Nowangie to or
from Mildura may see a curious-looking
piece of mechanical equipment coming
in along the new line. It is a tractor,
mounted upon a railway truck, which it
propels by chain-driven wheels, pushing
two 15-ton trucks in front and hauling
two behind. The outfit is used for trans-
porting gypsum deposits for the manu-
facture of plaster building sheets.

“S.T.S.”: Decided by a Bench of
suburban magistrates in Adelaide that the
word “copper,” used repeatedly in
addressing a policeman, is “insulting lan-
guage.” Fined ss. plus 225. 6d. costs.

“Mells”: The N.S.W. Crown Law
Department is scratching its head over
the case of a man who escaped from cus-
tody 10 years ago while serving a sen-
tence of nine months. Nothing more
was heard of him until a few weeks
back, when he was discovered to be living
in S. Aus. In the intervening period he
had worked industriously at his trade,
married, begotten children, become
reasonably prosperous and conducted
himself as a straight-going and, indeed,
an exemplary citizen. It is reckoned hard
that a past which would normally be
considered dead and buried should rise
up to make things unpleasant for him
after all these years. In America it is
generally a detective who stumbles on
the secret and considerately puts his blind
eye to the telescope, as Ben Price did
for Jimmy Valentine in one of O. Henry’s
gripping stories. But it isn’t so easy for
the Law, as a department, to yield to
human impulses.
THE NEW PENOLOGY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A radio set has been installed in Fremantle gaol
to enable inmates to get the Test-match scores.”
In those convict-system sketches Marcus Clarke
so grimly etches,
Ihe amenities were singularly few
ror the mostly hardened wretches who were
undergoing stretches,
As /he Gabbetts and the Vetches had to do.
I here s a grisly picture flashes in one’s memory
ol the lashes,
And the leg-irons and the curses and the
yells,
When a tig of black terbacker, in the intervals
of yacker,
Was the solitary solace of the cells.
But the world, ’twas never plainer, waxes
saner and humaner;
I hough our clinks and jugs and boobs still
hold their guests,
Though we regularly lag them and occasionally
_ scrag them,
We’d be loath to stop them listening-in to
Tests.
Though down evil pathways daily fellows still
go tripping gaily,
Snatching handbags, donging coppers, pinch-
ing cars;
Though a host of erring codgers, Sikeses down
to Artful Dodgers,
Must still be packed away behind the bars;
Still, we like to treat them kindly, not to flog
and starve them blindly
Into more elevating frames of mind.
There’s no need to keep them fretting or com-
plaining, or forgetting
All the interesting things they left behind.
Hence their lot we seek to lighten with the
picture-shows that brighten
And with music strains to their savage
breasts,
We'd as soon cut down their dinners as deny
them racecourse winners
Or debar them from the latest news of Tests.
We have done with human cages smacking of
the Middle Ages,
We have finished 'with the thumbscrew and
the rack;
We believe that moral suasion, well applied,
prevents occasion
For a dose of cat-o’-ninetails- on the back.
In the bad old days they broke ’em into quod
at picking oakum,
Now we set ’em peeling spuds or shelling
peas,
Or some sensible employment not devoid of
the enjoyment
That attends on honest effort, if you please;
And when night comes, darkness bringing, well,
they can’t be always singing
Or chucking orisons from off their chests,
Then what more wholesome pleasure for their
long nocturnal leisure
Than keeping tabs and measure on the Tests?
Coddling, you’re insinuating? Brother, would
you keep them waiting
Till another dawn with light the bars should
fleck,
Keep them in suspense, unknowing whether
Bradman’s fairly going
Or poor old England’s got it in the neck?
“Delightful fluffy little
things, aren’t they ?”
“My oath, they are!”
That were wanton torture surely, torture that
accords but poorly
With the high ideals of these enlightened
times,
When by gentleness we’re winning lots of repro-
bates from sinning
And discouraging by leniency crimes.
Blokes immured (for peccadilloes, it may be)
beside the billows,
Would you send them to their pillows and
their rests
While the ether rings and crashes with remarks
about the Ashes?
No, even gaols must listen-in to Tests!

T. THE R.


“Findy”: Why are barbers as a class
so supercilious? When I dine at the
Hotel Splendifore and inadvertently spill
the soup, the waiter doesn’t say “Usually
dine at home, eh?” Nor does the kiosk
man from whom I buy a packet
of cigarettes ask me whether I usually
roll my own. Yet on the rare occasions
when I seat myself in the barber’s chair
I am no sooner lathered and at his mercy
than he remarks, “Usually shave your-
self?” in a tone that implies there is no
secret that one can hide from him. He
follows this up with “Safety?” and “We
can always tell.” The effect is to make
me feel that my face looks as though I
usually shave with a lawn-mower and
finish off with a crosscut saw. I favor a
“Back to the Beard” movement.

“Beechworth”: I wonder if the revival
in Westralian gold-mining has brought
the lucky digger with money to burn
upon the scene once more. He was fre-
quent enough in the roaring ’nineties, and,
though he refrained from shoeing horses
with gold or using banknotes for sand-
wich material, numerous publicans had
good reason for regarding him highly.
It was “light come, light go” with too
many of Fortune’s favorites, but there
were others, like the unforgettable “Tom
“You mentioned Phyllis’s name in your sleep last night.”
“That’s funny—I was dreaming about Maud.”
the Rager,” who steadied up after
months or years of indiscriminate shout-
ing and took a good bit away with them.
One whom I recall had a poor reward
for his eleventh-hour prudence. He had
made a pot of money out of a Black
Range find, after years of struggling, and
had lashed up about half of it by the
usual methods. Then he suddenly be-
came haunted with the fear that he might
finish up in the Old Men’s Home, so he
sank everything he had left in an annu-
ity. It was to bring him in a good sum,
for he was over 60 ; but he had scarcely
drawn his first quarter’s income when he
fell down the steps of a pub and broke
his neck.
* * * *
“Malisch”: Last week I read of the
ringing-down of the curtain on a Sydney
youngster I knew well. He had a good
job in one of Sydney’s oldest shipping
companies trading with Eastern Asia, was
a bachelor, in perfect health and with
plenty of the world’s goods. He vanished
one morning, leaving no trace and aban-
doning a very considerable sum of money
left him as a legacy. His people, apply-
ing for the usual legal “declaration ot'
death,” told the Probate Court in Sydney
that they had searched the world for
news of him, the inquiries covering China
and Japan, of course, and also the
Legion L’Etrangere, without a whisper
of the vanished lad.

“Duchess”: Scorfield’s drawing (B.
16/5/ ’34) of the man who refuses to buy
an encyclopaedia for his boy—“let him
walk to school like I did” —reminds me
of one of Queensland’s pioneer pastoralists.
The old boy was in most respects a typi-
cal Scot. He had weathered many periods
of financial stress, and, used to living
hard, it took him some little time to
realise that he was safe in Easy-street.
His wife had reared him a family of sons,
and they sought to make things more
comfortable for their old mother in her
declining years. A deputation bearded
the old autocrat. “Father,” the spokes-
man suggested, “don’t you think it would
make things easier for mother if there
was linoleum in the house?” The old
boy withered him with a look. “Ah’ll no’
hae one o’ they domn squeakin’ things
aboot the place,” he snorted, “so lang
as Ah’ve th’ breath to blaw ma pipes.”

“Pawang”: A tribute is due to the
Canadian doctor who confined Mrs.
Donne of five offspring. As soon as the
event became front-page stuff, showmen
offered the parents large sums to let
them transport the litter to the World
Fair at Chicago. The parents were
anxious to accept, but the worthy medico
put his foot down on behalf of decent
humanity. As he had absolute authority,
there was nothing more to be said.

“Bluejacket”: “Ekim,” criticising a
radio version of the Mutiny of the Bounty
(B. 16/5/’34), tells us that “no naval officer
or seaman has ever taken an oath of any
kind.” Permit me to say that every
officer and man of the R.A.N. is a sworn
man, the oath being taken before he ever
sees a training establishment.
* * * *
“C. Coral”: One of Australia’s oldest
guides to mariners still stands on Raine
Island, a coral-encircled sandbank mark-
ing one of the entrances through the
Great Barrier Reef into Torres Strait.
Long ago, so many sailing-ships came
to grief in the vicinity that the Admiralty
decided to erect a “great tower” ; and
Captain Blackwood, of the survey ship
H.M.S. Fly, with the aid of the car-
pentef (who acted as architect), 20 picked
convicts skilled in stonework and a
number of free men, constructed a mas-
sive guide-post 70ft. high. Up to 40ft.
the walls were of coral, sft. thick at the
base, hewn out of reefs ; shells were burnt
for lime. The upper structure was a
dome of wood and canvas, for which
wrecked ships furnished the materials. The
job was completed inside three months ;
the speed is perhaps accounted for by
a statement of Tukes (the naturalist of
the Fly) that one could hardly move with-
out treading upon birds and eggs, and
that the tiny islet “stank like a foul hen-
roost.” Very few vessels pass that way
now, but the solid old coral structure
dating from the early part of last cen-
tury still stands.

“Nikko”: With languages (B. 6/6/’34)
as with money, it is often a case of “easy
come, easy go.” You may pick up a
foreign tongue and lose it when the need
for use no longer exists, but a language
learned and spoken fluently in childhood
“I don’t think you’d like the new play, dad. It almost shocked ME.”
is not forgotten. My grandmother, who
began to learn both French and Eng-
lish at the age of 12, had, until then,
spoken nothing but Gaelic. At 80 she
retained a smattering of French, but she
astonished a Scottish visitor by dis-
coursing volubly in Gaelic, which she
had had no occasion to speak for 60
years. Her theory that a language one
had thought in in youth remained clear
always was her chief reason for disbeliev-
ing in the Tichborne claimant. Tichborne
himself as a young man spoke French
like a native, whereas Orton could recol-
lect nothing of the language he was sup-
posed to have once known as well as
English.

“X.N.0.”: The 8.8. C. has adopted the
24-hour clock, and one wonders how
much longer British conservatism will
reject its obvious advantages. The Con-
tinent has used it for goodness knows
how long, and Continental timetables
leave one in no doubt as to whether
a train arrives or departs at 8.53
a.m. or 8.53 p.m. The British Navy,
which can’t afford to be too con-
servative, introduced the system before
this century was five years old, but
the rest of us are still liable to
be misunderstood if we visit a feminine
acquaintance at midnight when she really
meant noon.

“Auralia”: The controversy in West-
ralia as to who should hump the secesh
petition to Buckingham Palace and
Westminster recalls that, 34 years ago,
the goldfields “Separation for Federa-
tion” crowd found some difficulty over
the same question. Their petition went
across the seas per medium of the Gov-
ernor of the period, but as it was accom-
panied by another document from
Premier Forrest, directed to exposing
its alleged fallacies, it was thought that
the petitioners should have someone on
the spot to hammer in their side of the
case. The job was eventually delegated
to Father O’Gorman, who had taken an
active part in the agitation and who
happened to be visiting England on other
business. Whether the goldfields dele-
gate managed to interview anyone in
authority is hard to say, but the state-
ment unkindly cabled from London that
he had got no further than the “fourth
doormat of the Colonial Office” lashed
the separatists into frenzy for weeks
afterwards. Nevertheless the agitation
did its work indirectly ; it forced Forrest
to submit the Federation Bill to the
people.
“Ike Hollar”.: Whenever I see a report
of resolutions carried by some society
with a grandiloquent name, I get a pic-
ture of a dingy room with half a dozen
fanatics grouped around a small table,
probably (but not invariably) surmounted
by a water bottle. Having been in the
business myself, i know what publicity
can be worked from the scantiest
material. A few years ago a regular
boom was given to the proceedings of
an organisation with a name something
like “The Fellowship of Freedom-loving
Flagflappers.” Nearly every day space
was found in the dailies for high-sound-
ing resolutions on various subjects, until
the papers dropped to the fact that the
Fellowship consisted entirely of a mass
of impressive stationery and a president
and a secretary who sat upon an up-
turned soapbox to concoct their propa-
ganda. The concern of an organisation
with Empire aims about a fine of ten
bob inflicted upon a speaker in a North
Sydney park was emphasised by three
pugnacious resolutions in one week.
Then one of the papers began to investi-
gate, and the game was up. The orator
who had been fined was the secretary.
* * * *
“X.S.”: For probably the first time on
record, legal sanction of a sort has been
given to the belief in the magical potency
of the number 13. A defendant in the City
Court, Melbourne, objected to her case
being set down for hearing on the 13th
of June. Bond, P.M., made it the fol-
lowing day.

“Shep”: Doses of tetanus serum
weren’t always entered on wounded men’s
tickets (B. 6/ 6/’34); a quicker and better
method in the advanced dressing stations'
was to mark a capital “T” on the fore-
head with indelible pencil. Cards were
easily lost or dragged off or torn off, but
it took a good scrub to get rid of the fore-
head brands. I’ve seen men doubly
branded, one “T” on their bandages and
another alongside the puncture in their
chests. During a rush of casualties in the
Menin Road dressing station it seemed
to be everyone’s job, from the doc. down,
to make dead sure of the tetanus serum
injections. Bearers loading wounded for
further back looked for the “T’s” as they
loaded the ambulances. Even the buffet
orderly dishing out tea to those awaiting
evacuation looked for them, and a story
used to be told of a British staff officer
who called in there to glance over things.
Seeing a mob of wounded men sipping
tea, all with their “T” brands, he sarcas-
tically demanded of the orderly: “Is the
hot tea so bally scarce that you have to
check off every poor lad who gets a mug-
ful?”
BALLADE OF FISH AND CHIPS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Five Judges of the High Court have decided that
fish and chips are not subject to sales tax.”
They met, five pundits skilled in legal lore
And soaked in precedents from Ato Z,
With all the wisdom in their garnered store
Dredged out of books that one or other had
read,
From Coke and Blackstone down to Birken-
head.
They listened while the lawyers got to grips
And, finally, with one accord they said:
“Hands off the proletariat’s fish and chips!”
They met as men accustomed to explore
Strange avenues where all is dark ahead,
Dim labyrinths where none have been before,
Mazes ’twould puzzle lesser lights to thread.
Human, they might have differed, but instead
Their fiat came with no dissenting lips
A doubt on its validity to shed:
They all stood solidly for fish and chips.
Their eagle eyes went to the problem’s core;
They brooked no arguments which might
have led
To logic-chopping and forensic roar
And stodgy law reports o’er columns spread—
The pabulum that most approach with dread
And that the ordinary reader skips.
One sentence only o’er the land they sped:
“Thou shalt not tax the people’s fish and
chips.”
Hey, there, Diego! Fill my plate once more
With flathead flakes and spuds in piquant
strips,
Here’s to the Solons five who overbore
The odious impost upon fish and chips!

POLITICAL POINTS
Tas. Labor, which had only a third
of the representation in the last Assem-
bly, did well at the State election. Not
well enough, apparently, to be capable
of ousting the Lee Government (though
P.R. is apt to play tricks when prefer-
ences are counted), but it improved its
position in each of the five six-member
districts, holding its ten seats and gaining
four. Of the two Fed. Labs, who chal-
lenged the Ogilvie group, ex-Minister
Becker polled pretty well, but Jude, the
A.W.U. man, lost his deposit in Denison
—a fact which will have repercussions
on the mainland.
Though the Launceston “Examiner”
gave him hark from the tomb, Chief
Secretary James has evidently been re-
turned for Bass (Tas.) ; but Hon. Minister
Hobbs got a dreadful doing in Darwin.
He may not save his deposit.
Defeated Commonwealth legislators
rarely return to State politics on the
mainland, but in Tasmania they make a
habit of it. Six were among the starters
at the Speck election on Saturday—
Atkinson and O’Keefe in Wilmot; Sea-
brook and Frost in Franklin ; Culley in
Denison, and Jackson in Bass. If Jen-
sen’s health were not worrying him there
would have been seven. Culley is the one
certainty at the moment.
The £12,000,000 Commonwealth Loan
was oversubscribed in two days. There
has been murmuring in Macquarie-street
at the interest being exempt from State
income tax and from the special Federal
tax on property income. All Common-
wealth loans are free of State income tax.
It is one of the reasons why all income
tax should be levied by the Common-
wealth.
The longer the Disarmament Confer-
ence lasts the stormier it grows. Last
week’s proceedings were given over to
“Hop into it, lads, and disarm these
disarmament blokes !”
bitter arguments and reproaches. If this
goes on it may be necessary to send a
file of soldiers to disarm the Disarma-
ment Conference.
The three Hogan Labor Ministers who
contested Vic. Leg. Council seats on
Saturday got in. Beckett had a com-
fortable victory in Melbourne East, and
preferences put Williams (who stood as
an Independent) well ahead of the Labor
candidate in Melbourne North; but
Jones, now U.A.P. Minister of Works,
was rather hard pressed by Gill, the
Mayor of Newtown, in the South-western
Province. However, he had the majo-
rity, and that’s the only thing that
matters.
Canvassers working in the Melbourne
East Province of the Leg. Council found
it impossible to bring a large proportion
of the electors to the poll. Of 19,000
enrolled, 8000 had moved. The depres-
sion has contributed to this migration ;
still, Australians have always been like
that. It largely accounts for the regu-
larity with which Government home-
building schemes crash.
Uncle Sam was literally paid in his
own paper the other day, and is making
a fuss about it. When the Olympic ran
down the Nantucket lightship in a fog,
“What’s the prahposition ? Paying me
in my own paper ? Well, of all the
goldarned nerve!”
with loss of life, its owners faced a claim
for 500,000 dollars and promptly paid in
U.S.A. bonds. Uncle is now bellowing
about issuing writs and confiscating the
liner.
After a meeting which must have
sounded like a Disarmament Conference,
Martin,.M.L.A., the “unendorsed” Cocky
member for Gunbower (Vic.), has been
admitted to Caucus. This is flat defiance
of the C.P. Central Council, but it is hard
to see what that body can do about it.
The strength of Vic. Assembly is now
U.A.P., 29; U.C.P., 17; Labor, 16; In-
dependents, 4. Premier Argyle, who has
returned to his job after a long illness,
has a very thorny bed on which to con-
valesce.
Launcestonians were recently shocked
at a report that five trainees in their
public hospital had contracted tuber-
culosis. Dr. Bell Ferguson has informed
them that the five cases occurred in 1933
and were traceable to a carrier. He went
on to say, in effect, that the nursing staff
was too small, and was kept at work too
long—6o hours a week, with one day
off, and a fortnight every six months.
He suggested reduction to 50 hours
and ten more appointments. Launceston
is far from being the only place where
hospital nurses toil long hours and crack
up, and in most cases the pay is small ;
but nobody seems to care very much.
N.S.W. Minister Spooner snubbed a
deputation of aldermen who asked his
Government to help them to get 6 p.c.
and 54- p.c. municipal loans converted,
saying it would be a breach of contract
with the lenders. Still, the lenders might
be open to reason. Money could be
borrowed at lower rates ; with the sanc-
tion of the Argyle Government, Mel-
bourne City Council is raising £172,000
at 3\ p.c.
It was a Nat. Government that made
Clydesdale, the Labor M.L.C., chairman
of the Westralian Lotteries Commission,
with a large addition to his Parliamen-
tary salary, but a Labor Government has
fallen in for all the trouble. The Chief
Justice decided that the lottenes job con-
stituted an office of profit under the
Crown. Now the Government has
brought in a Constitution Amendment
Bill to permit Clydesdale to keep
it. The measure has made a very bad
impression, especially as Clydesdale does
not need to be specially exempted from
a salutary constitutional safeguard. He
is comfortably off.
Of course, when it was announced that
J. Bull would not come down with the
dust on June 15 he was accused in Lang’s
newspaper of having “adopted the Lang
Plan,” as per Lang’s resolution:
That the Governments of Australia
decide to pay no further interest to British
bondholders until Britain has dealt with
the overseas debt in the same manner as
she settled her own foreign debts with
America.
The Australian debt to British bond-
holders was contracted with private
persons, and the interest, towards which
public works furnish something, is pay-
able in goods. The British war loans
were borrowed from the U.S.A. Govern-
ment, and were taken out in goods and
services, but the lender refuses to receive
the interest in goods and services. If
anyone can see any analogy he should
rush to get his eyes straightened.
Members travelling from Victoria to
attend Parliamentary sittings (they are not
all Victorians) are in future to be carried
from Goulburn to Canberra by motor-
’bus, instead of special train. It will mean
a saving of three hours at least. There
is no mention of the privilege being ex-
tended to the people. Time is money to
the people as well as to the politicians,
and the people are equally appreciative of
comfort and convenience ; but slow trains
and trams are good enough for them.
Although N.S.W. possesses a costly
Public Works Department which has not
had much to do since the end of 1929,
its Government is setting up another
organisation, headed by Mr. George
Julius, to distribute the £2,500,000 it is
raising for unemployed-relief. Mr. Julius
is chairman of the National Research
Council, and as such has acknowledged
that “nearly £16,000, alleged by Professor
Chapman to have been in Commonwealth
bonds or to be deposited with the Royal
Society, cannot be accounted for.” Mr.
Julius is a very charming gentleman,
but
The terms of the new Soviet loan ought
to make Lyons’s mouth water. The
amount is 3? billion roubles ; the term,
ten years ; the interest, 10 p.c. Bonds are
exempt from all taxes and levies, and
there is a prize section in which every
“It may be bigger and better iced, Ivan;
but mine doesn’t really need icing.”
bond will win a prize every year for ten
years. Even Lang has never promised
anything like that.
Nowadays the A.W.U. is about the
only union that matters in Queensland,
and it rules with a heavy hand. The
ironworkers asked the Trades and Labor
Council to see what it could do about
rotational workers being compelled to
take out A.W.U. tickets. As rotational
work pans out at one month in twelve
and the A.W.U. ticket is for the full year,
there is ground for complaint. Tne Cjov-
ernment was approached, but the Minis-
ter for Labor declined “to interfere with
the internal affairs of a union.
The Royal Commission on Petrol
started its investigations a year ago m
Melbourne, has listened to 2,28/,0/-
words of evidence and is still listening.
It bids fair to beat the record.
De Valera’s bill abolishing the Free
State Senate has reached that Chamber,
whose President has denounced it and
its author from the floor of the House.
It is sure to be rejected, but, unless Dail
“This looks easy for Dewy, but I don't
feel like tackling Paddy Lynch. He
might put a horseshoe in his glove”
Eireann weakens, may be deemed to have
been passed by both Houses after 270
days. Australian Laborites are watching
the procedure with interest, for they have
a Senate-abolition plank on their plat-
form, though it is rarely produced nowa-
days. But to make it effective they
would have to get the consent of a
majority of the electors and of majori-
ties in four States.
The East Toowoomba by-election,
rendered necessary by the mysterious
death of T. R. Roberts, is to be held in
July. Hitherto, East Toowoomba has
been a safe Country-Nat. seat, but
Roberts had a strong personal following
and Labor is hoping to upset the cart this
time. It is getting ready for a plebis-
cite ; the other side is asking J. D.
Annand to stand. He is Mayor of Too-
woomba, and was its member in Moore’s
time.
Brisbane’s Labor Lord Mayor has con-
firmed the sinister report that he in-
tended to don the gauds of his office,
and was quite brazen about it. Com-
rade Jones attended a Government
House levde wearing robes, rabbitskins,
chains and cocked hat, and was photo-
graphed. It is expected that the photo-
graph will be exhibit A in the case for
expulsion at the next A.L.P. conference.
A few hours before a Perth jury found
a son-slayer not guilty on the ground of
insanity, a Richmond (Vic.) man cut
the throats of his wife and three chil-
dren, and finally his own. Investigating
his history, the police discovered that he
had battered his first wife to death 10
years before, had been found not guilty
on the ground of insanity, and been re-
leased after three years in the asylum.
Laws which permit such verdicts will
have to be reviewed.
Queensland’s wheat board and its
millers have patched up a truce. For
seven months the millers refused to buy
at the board’s fixed price and got grain
from southern States, with the result
that last season’s Queensland crop could
find few buyers. Millers have now agreed
to take a substantial parcel of Queens-
land wheat at a bushel above the
ruling rate at Darling Harbor, which
was 2s. lid. at the week-end. The agree-
ment is to run for three months and will
be welcomed by the growers, who have
had to wait for their money for the
second season in succession.

IREMS
The tallest entrant for the centenary air
race is Warren Penny, son of Clifton
Penny, Sydney’s tallest solicitor. Penny
first flew ’planes for an oil concern in
America, and when he began was the
world’s youngest pilot. Since returning
to Australia he has earned a crust by
radio announcing. He is a good all-
round athlete.
C. W. Andrewartha, of Caulfield (Vic.),
is one of those who have found
means of beating the depresh. Unable
to get a job in his trade as cabinet-
maker, he turned to pipe-organ building.
He picked up most of what he knows
from a technical magazine which he
found at a public library. His first organ
was made for himself. Then he got a
contract to build one for Caulfield Angli-
can church. He is now at work on a
third.
Sarah Sanderson, Geelong’s oldest
native, is in her 91st year. Her father
arrived at Port Phillip in 1838, and
settled on Dr. Thompson’s holding in
Geelong, where she was born. She was
one of the first school-teachers in Vic-
toria, and can remember the turning of
the first sod of the Melbourne-Geelong
railway. The A.l.F.’s Brand is a nephew.
“D.”: Few men have been so many
things, and so good at all of them, as the
late W. A. Holman. He began as a
cabinet-maker, and he was an artist at
the trade to the last. He was a first-
class journalist; some of his articles on
constitutional questions were classics of
clear, reasoned writing. He was success-
ful as a junior barrister, and still more

Commission.
so, for a time, as a silk. He was an
authority on French literature and an
excellent fencer. And he served N.S.W.
as both a Labor and a Nationalist
Premier.
Thousands of Sydneyites have noticed
a venerable steam-engine puffing away in
the neighborhood of old buildings and
a man with a pipe directing its activities.
The engine belongs to the Telfer Clean-
ing Process, and the man behind it
is a Digger. Sid Telfer left with the
2nd Battalion, and got a D.C.M. When
not at his odd job he attends to the
affairs of the 2nd Battalion Association,
which aims at helping members in need.
“The Clerk” on successful N.S.W.
youngsters:
Eric Callaway (B. 30/5/’34) isn’t the only
one. Stan Wilson, director of Farmer’s; Frank
McDowell, of the drapery firm; T. Ritchie,
director of Noyes Bros.; and T. H. Silk,
managing director of Mort’s Dock, are all in
their thirties. At 33 Tom Watson is general
manager of Tooth’s. C. R. McKerihan is
Chairman of Commissioners of the Rural Bank,
Norman Nock is boss of Nock and Kirby’s,
and Norman Rydge is chairman and guiding
star of several large financial concerns; and
they are all well under 40. Managing-director
Palmer, of the men’s clothing store, is only 29,
and Mark Barnett, who joined Angus and
Coote as a useful boy, fresh from school, and
for the past two years has been manager, is
two years younger.
“M.”: Here’s a family record that will
take some beating. John Nimmo, who is
retiring from the job of foreman book-
keeper in the Government Printing De-
partment, Hobart, has served there for 57
years. His brother James, with 55 years’
service, is still carrying on as warehouse-
man, and John’s son has been a comp,
in the same department for 35 years.
The death of Tom Roberts, 'M.L.A.
for East Toowoomba, who was found
drowned at Southport, came as a
shock to hundreds of Queenslanders. He
was naturally cheerful, but he took his
politics seriously, and of late years had
not been in the best of health. Roberts had
been 27 years in the Assembly, had no
enemies, was always impersonal in debate
and asked no more of his party than the
minor offices of Whip and Chairman of
Committees. He was a tinsmith by trade
and had been in Toowoomba for 40
years.
This is a Finey impression of the most
popular conductor who has visited Aus-
tralia so far. Sir
Hamilton Harty -no
doubt paid a visit
or two to Blarney
either during his
boyhood in Co.
Down or later
when he was tak-
ing his LL.D. de-
gree at Queen’s
University, Belfast.
In any case, he is
a naturally charm-
ing character. He
has been con-
ductor-in-chief of
the London Sym-
phony Orchestra
since 1933, and is
almost as well
known and liked in
the U.S.A. (which
he has toured many
times as a guest-
conductor) as he is
in England and
Ireland. He began
a series of sym-
phony concerts
with the Broad-
casting Commis-
sion Orchestra in
Sydney on Satur-
day night.
“Aliquis”: Cap-
tain Smirnoff, who
will pilot one of the
four Royal Dutch
Airline’s entries for
the centenary race,
is likely to shake
things up. It was
Smirnoff, a Dutchman of Russian
descent, who last December made record
flights from Holland to Batavia, 8968
miles, and back—in four days four hours
forty minutes and four days four hours
thirty-three minutes respectively. He
used a two-year-old standard Fokker
XVIII with a total h.p. of 1290, cruising
speed 122 m.p.h., and no special equip-
ment for night flying, and he had only
an hour’s notice before taking off.
George Rayner Hoff, A.R.C.A., R.S.,
A.R.8.5., was born in the Isle of Man,
where his father
was a carver in
stone and wood.
He first studied
architecture and
sculpture at the
Nottingham School
of Art. He had
hardly begun when
the war came and
occupied his time
for three and a
half years. After
the Armistice he
went to the Royal
College of Art,
South Kensington,
and worked under
Derwent Wood,
R.A. In 1922 he
won the blue rib-
bon of his profes-
sion—the Rome
scholarship. Aus-
tralia achieved him
in the capacity of
teacher of sculp-
ture at Sydney
Technical College
in 1923. Every-
body likes him, but
he has been more
or less of a storm-
centre ever since
his arrival. Some
object to the nudes
of his Anzac
Memorial, others
to his Vic. Centen-
ary Medal design.
Throughout these periodical disturbances
he retains the imperturbable expression
which has been registered by Frith in
the accompanying study.
“C R B.”: The passing of Frank Bow-
den has caused gaps in Tasmania’s life.
He started as a messenger boy and
finished chief of the telegraph branch of
the post office. Choirmaster, soloist, bell-
ringer, secretary of innumerable public
movements for helping down-and-outs —
every kind of good work came alike to
him, and he kept at it for 73 years. One
of his sons is a Cambridge professor
whose subject is metallurgy.
James Armstrong, who had a 90th
birthday recently, arrived in Keppel Bay
in 1864 when 19 years old —long before
Canoona rush filled the countryside with
gold-diggers—and levelled the ground
on which the first railway station was
built in Rockhampton. He has been
employed by Archer Bros., the pioneers
of the district, for 40 years.
“Ad.”: Adelaide was surprised lately
by the arrival of two young men, R. H.
Webster and R. C. Minter, after an in-
land voyage “from Brisbane.” This
wasn’t literally possible, of course. After
getting up the Bremer to Ipswich, there
had to be a transfer of some 140 miles
by train over the watershed to Dalby.
The Condamine, then a mere trickle,
took them only five miles in three days,
but rain came. Down the Balonne were
countless rocks “and falls, but, when the
winding Culgoa brought them at last into
the Darling above Bourke, the rest was
fairly simple. At Mannum, on the
Murray, near Adelaide, they sold their
Krazy Kate, a 10-foot dinghy with a 17-
foot mast. Distance uncertain, but
boldly estimated by the voyagers at 3500
miles; time, 13 weeks.
W. McCallum Park, of Enoggera (Q.),
must be about the oldest bowler on
earth. He still plays regularly at 98.
Born in Scotland, he arrived in Queens-
land in 1863, and constructed many of
Brisbane’s earliest buildings. For years
he was a Government works inspector
in the Far North. He founded the Enog-
gera Presbyterian Church, and was at
one time Chief Ruler of the Rechabites.
“J.L.”: The mileage figures of Father
Rockliff (B. 30/5/’34) pale into insigni-
ficance beside those of Jim Hammond,
RAYNER HOFF, of Anzac Memorial and Centenary
Medal fame.
senior conductor of the train that runs
between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie.
Since he joined the department 17 years
ago he has averaged 2100 miles a week;
say 150,000 in all. He is a product of
London, and had a 62nd birthday re-
cently.
From “Second Divvy”:
The Hollywood “Low-Down” says that
Victor McLaglen, ballyhooed in Australia
recently as a much-decorated major in the
Black Watch, was never under fire. When the
war began he was a policeman in Winnipeg.
He joined up after a while, and “his histrionic
abilities won him a temporary lieutenancy,”
but didn’t carry him into the front line. It
has an air of veracity. Victor looks much
too bloodthirsty to be true. All the V.Cs. I
have met have been mild-looking customers,
with gentle voices and unimpressive figures. As
against which one of the most soldierly beings
I ever clapped eyes on—six feet two of up-
standing brawn and a voice like a Stadium an-
nouncer—declared himself medically unfit as
soon as he realised what warfare was, and did
the rest of his scrapping in a Lark Hill train-
ing camp. Another equally terrifying specimen
volunteered “for transport services only.” Has
anyone ever known a bona fide desperado who
looked the part?
Henry Gunning, of Cooma (N.S.W.),
who died the other day, aged 80, had an
odd hobby: he was an amateur meteor-
ologist. He maintained a private station,
where he did work which was of great
benefit to Monaro people. He landed in
Australia in 1872 with half a sovereign
and a healthy capacity for work, and
soon made good. Meteorology apart, his
chief interests were the council, hospital,
St. Paul’s Church, temperance move-
ments and planting trees in Cooma.
This year will see the retirement of
two famous Bananaland stipes. H. L.
Archdall, the State’s first Chief Police
Magistrate, has been in Queensland for

Ever since the discoveries of Ford,
Bayley and Hannan started the rush
of thirsty people to Coolgardie and Kal-
goorlie in the early ’nineties, this co. has
enjoyed a lion’s share of the trade in the
West. For nearly 20 years afterwards
divs. ranged from 24 p.c. to 32 p.c. The
rate dropped to 16 p.c. in 1911, follow-
ing the -transfer of £101,450 from reserves
to capital, and then remained steady,
sweetened with 4 p.c. bonuses in the
fattest periods, until the March half of
1931. For the next two years 14 p.c. p.a.
was paid from earnings well in excess of
that rate.
Meanwhile, the number engaged in
gold-mining more than doubled ; so did
the value of the output in Australian cur-
rency, and the growth continues. Also,
during the 12 months to the end of
March, the rise in the price of wool put
more money into circulation, the percent-
age of unemployed in Westralia dropped
from 30.3 in the second quarter of 1932
to 19.5 for the first quarter of this year,
the tax-gatherers took a few straws off
the camel’s back, and the co.’s harvest
was the richest for the last four years.
The spring in gross earnings (£241,061,
of which rents, etc., provided £52,756)
was £40,606. Including an extra £1663
set aside for taxation (£24,518) and an
additional £15,728 struck off for depre-
ciation (£45,183), exes. (£152,794) took
£26,727 of the increase. Including
£13,099 dropped from somewhere into
reserves, and after handing the prefs.
their £3OOO, there was enough to show
23.1 p.c. on ord. capital as against 20.1,
17.3, 21.5, 26.7 and 29.2 p.c. back to
1929. So the div. was lifted from 12 p.c.
p.a. for the first half to 16 p.c. p.a. for
the second half (which includes the thirsty
summer months), and a 2 p.c. bonus
was added, making 16 p.c. for the year.
These high returns on capital alone are
due mainly to the support and assistance
of reserves, visibly £203,988 in excess of
capital at March 30.
Not only is the co.’s purse thus bulg-
ing, but the family stocking is suspected
of being full, too —additions have con-
stantly been made to the brewery and
hotel freeholds, etc., and paid for out
of earnings ; then from the same source
these items have been written down.
Here is as much as balance-sheet figures
tell:

Last year £25,107 more was spent than
was written off on hotel freeholds, etc.
Still, the more or less liquid surplus
(£106,273, including mortgages but not
shares in other cos.) was £13,697 stronger
than it was a year earlier. Shareholdings
consist of all the scrip in the Castle-
maine and Emu cos., bought in ’26 and
’27 respectively.
Over the last 2\ years the market has
lengthened its bid for the fully-paid 255.
shares from 555. to 90s. ; the highest
price paid was 102 s. in 1929. The return
at 90s. is 4.5 p.c. on a 16 p.c. div. basis.
At 265. the well-protected prefs.—there
are only 50,000 of them —yield 4.6 p.c.

Consumption of gas and electricity in
Sydney reached its lowest level in 1931,
when a couple of points were chipped
off this co.’s ord. div., reducing it to 8
p.c., and all visible reserves, including
provision for depreciation (£310,242 at
April 30, 1931), were used to write down
book values. The div. was lifted to 10
p.c. again in 1932, thanks to a smaller-
than-usual allowance for depreciation;
but it dropped back to 8 p.c. in the fol-
lowing year, owing to reductions in the
price charged to consumers, and has re-
mained there, notwithstanding a steady
increase in consumption. Indeed, for
a co. enjoying a monopoly of a public
utility to pay more than 8 p.c. these days
may prove to be an indiscretion.
During the 12 months covered by the
latest accounts, two further cuts of one-
twentieth of a penny each were made in
the price charged for a unit of current.
Together they represent an aggregate
concession of nearly £6OOO on the basis
of last year’s consumption, which showed
an all-round increase. The growth in
the number of consumers was 1417, and
revenue was £5221 better:

A tight hold was kept upon working
exes, (up £1123), and the allowance for
taxation (£17,000) was £3OOO lighter. The
co. was thus able to pay the pref. div.,
repeat the 8 p.c. to the ords., visibly allow
an extra £7715 for depreciation (shown
as written off in the introductory table),
and send £lOOO to the staff fund ; the
lot called for £55 more profit than was
claimed.
Capital expenditure for the year
amounted to £49,825, while the net re-
duction in the book value of fixed assets
was £19,281 ; so £14,241 was apparently
struck off in addition to the visible allow-
ance for depreciation, etc.:

Outstanding features of the business of
this 12-year-old hosiery manufacturer
have been, and still are, the enterprise
of the management and its war against
production costs, the aim being to im-
prove quality, lower selling prices and
thus liven turnover. The board took
prompt advantage of the opportunities
which the emergency tariff and exchange
provided ; more plant was installed arid
the business was extended to Maoriland,
where an interest in one of the leading
mills was bought a year or so ago, and
to the manufacture of high-grade lin-
gerie, etc., not catered for by other
manufacturers, the chairman says.
Last year competition further forced
down prices, and, after providing some-
thing for depreciation (there is evidence
that these allowances have not been
skimped in the past), the board wrote
gross earnings (£119,747) £5519 short of
the previous year’s. Including £2OOO
openly struck off the book value of build-
ings, and £4002 set aside for the tax-
gatherer, administrative charges, etc.
(£99,951), were pulled back £6048, leav-
ing enough to pay the larger pref. div.
(£8244 —an extra £45,800 of pref. capital
was gathered in the previous term) and
show 10.2 p.c. on ord. capital as against
12.4, 13, 12.3, 37.7 and 44.1 p.c. back to
1929. The div. was kept at p.c., and
the 24 p.c. bonus was repeated, making
10 p.c. for the year. But share premiums
make 10 p.c. worth no more than 6.6 p.c.
on capital gathered since 1925, while the
jettisoning of half the amount paid up
in the early post-war slump reduces the
return to half the declared rate on old
holdings.

To carry an extra £27,907 of debtors’
balances, reduce the amount coming to
sundry creditors by £27,553 and add
£6250 net to the book value of fixed
assets, the board drew upon cash, etc.,
for £13,554, reduced the stocks item by
£19,784 and went to its bankers for an
extra £22,963. There was little movement
in the more or less liquid surplus (£91,789,
including stocks but not shares).
The fully-paid 10s. ords. have been
fairly steady in the market for the past

A well-managed trust offers many ad-
vantages to the investor. It provides
him with expert service, as well as a
judicious spread of risks, and relieves
him of the anxiety of managing to the
best advantage a small portfolio. On
the other hand, he can expect but mod-
erate returns until substantial reserves —
they are the cornerstone of this class of
business —have been accumulated.
Judged on this basis, the Reliance has
put up a very heartening performance,
considering that it was formed at the
end of 1929, when the economic
barometer was low and falling fast. In-
come from investments was enough to
pay shareholders 2\ p.c. for each of
the first three years, and 5 p.c. for the
last term, when capital profits from
changes in the co.’s holdings turned in
a further £13,751. This was placed direct
to reserves, raising them to £16,539, thus
strengthening the support and assistance
for the £50,082 of capital.
At the start, most of the co.’s funds
was invested in Government securities,
as the following table shows:
, Shares ,
No. Bonds, Pref. Ord.

1933.. 135 13.0 *9.8 77.'2
1934.. 200 17.9 10.1 72.0
The investment changes have resulted in
a wider spread of risks, as well as sub-
stantial capital profit and better dividend
returns, etc. Also, at the end of March
the market value of the co.’s investments
exceeded their book value (£67,559) by
£7493. The amount coming to outsiders
was £2791 ; cash (£1956) and book debts,
etc. (£3441), totalled £5397.
The year’s income was £1605 better
at £3913, and exes., which are commend-
ably low at £1124, took only £92 of the
increase, leaving the net revenue at 5.6
p.c. on capital as against 2.6, 4.3 and 3.2
p.c. for the three preceding years.
At the moment there is nothing to
suggest that the 5 p.c. div., a satisfac-
tory return these days, is likely to be
interfered with. The board, headed by
Stan Ricke.tson, has demonstrated its
ability, and the co.’s prospects are those
of the market generally.
The fully-paid 10s. shares, which are
covered by net tangibles with a book
value of 13s. 4d., are not listed. Recent
sales were at 10s. 3d.

In 1932 a dry spell, followed by severe
frosts, greatly reduced the crushings, and
therefore the earnings, of this and other
sugar cos. in the Bundaberg district. But
growing conditions improved as 1933
advanced, and a good average crop was
harvested. The outturn of raws for
the whole State (about 621,000 tons) was
the biggest yet, being approximately
40,000 tons in excess of the previous peak
figure in 1931. Australian consumption
was 348,700 tons ; the balance had to
be sold overseas at low prices. Because
of this and of a cut of id. per pound in
the Australian retail price, last year’s
average price for raws was £2 Is. lOd.
lighter at £l7 4s. 3d.
Still, the board put net earnings at
£31,745 as against £16,301 for the pre-
vious term. The difference between these
figures and profits in the table are net
additions to the replacement reserve (now
£179,977), which appears to be largely
provision in excess of current require-
ments for depreciation, etc. Declared net
earnings were 11.9 p.c. on capital, com-
pared with 6.1, 10.7, 10.2, 9.9, 10.2 and
16 p.c. back to 1927. So a couple of
points were added to the div., lifting it
to 10 p.c.
Though the outlook for the current
term is for a heavier crushing, the
market prefers to regard the co. as an
average 8 p.c. proposition, which it has

This co., whose freezing works are at
Victoria Dock, Melbourne, handles the
produce of Victorian butter factories on
a semi-co-operative basis. It also handles
meat, rabbits and all kinds of butter-
manufacturing equipment. Since the re-
construction in 1920, it has paid out in
divs., bonuses and rebates to clients
£111,616, equal to an average of £7972
annually, or approximately 32 p.c. on
capital.
During the last term the butter-export
business got askew, and gross earnings
(£21,627, including £5355 of commissions
rebated to clients) fell away £2663. Exes.
(£7786) were up £Bl, leaving the profit
£2744 short of the previous year’s. The
usual 7 p.c. div. was repeated, the amount
paid in rebates was practically halved,
nothing was visibly struck off for depre-
ciation, and £6741 as against £1169 in
the previous term was ploughed in.

He left her an Orchard
but she needed an
INCOME
A CERTAIN orchard ist would never assure his
life. “I shall leave you this orchard and it
will provide you always with a good income,”
he used to say to his wife.
Since he died the orchard has yielded no profit.
Prices have; been low and working expenses high.
The widow lacks the capital that would bring the
orchard up to the point of making profits at present
prices. Moreover, she lacks an income on which
to live.
It is always a mistake to leave property without
A.M.P. assurance as well. The cash from the
A.M.P. policies enables probate duties to be paid,
and the estate to be carried on. It is an essential if
the family is to be relieved of distress and worry.
Every A.M.P. policy is backed by the Society’s
£93,000,000 worth of assets, and the man who
becomes a member of the Society employs those
assets to make secure his own estate. The Society
will be glad to send to any citizen an experienced
counsellor to talk over this phase of its usefulness;
or it will send booklets explaining the benefits of
membership.
Those who have not arranged for such security as is
here discussed should not delay. Next month may
be too late.

Levies under the Paterson plan ceased
in April, and, since some of the objec-
tions raised by S. Aus. and Tas. had been
overcome, the new equalisation scheme
commenced to function at the beginning
of May. An all-Australian price of 140 s.
per cwt. of butter was agreed to, where-
upon the Melbourne price shot up from
li2s. to 140 s. After much fluctua-
tion, the London market for Australian
choicest is now fairly steady around 755.,
and the Export Board is systematically

Drillers, Ltd., an offshoot of Oil Search,
Ltd., has had no difficulty in placing the
200,000 ss. shares it offered: 55,000 of
them at a premium of 2s. 6d. each. By
diligently piecing together data obtained
by a number of cos. which stabbed for a
commercial pool in the Roma-Blythdale
district, but missed, what is claimed to
be the first really closed structure in a
proved petroliferous area in Queensland
has been located. To test this structure,
Drillers commenced to put down a hole
on April 4. The well had reached 3065 ft.
oh June 7. The critical stage will
arrive within the next month or so,
between 3500 ft. and 3900 ft., the latter
being bedrock.

a lot of other ground has been taken
up. On the old Shamrock lease crush-
ings have averaged over an ounce ; the
New Shamrock has put through 12 tons
for 200 z.; the Native Bee is on a for-
mation with seams up to 18in., and values
are improving with depth; the Monte

Bismarck Range is still in the rich patch
struck at Lucknow (N.S.W.). During
the last five months it has extracted over
£30,000 worth of gold, and has paid
£20,000 in dividends since March. Now
that the 80ft. and 110 ft. levels have been
connected, and the lode proved at the
lower depth, there is another 12 months’
divs. in sight, the chairman says. A
new reef is being opened up in the upper
levels, and 20 years’ work is talked of.
The field, however, has a reputation for
being patchy.

Tullamore (N.S.W.) has proved the
lode for a length of 600 ft., the average
width being 44 inches, and average value
of all samples to date is loz. lldwt. Two
shafts, approximately 250 ft. apart, are
down 240 ft. Assuming 13.5 cubic feet
of ore to the ton, the co. has approxi-
mately 35,000 tons developed.

high-grade, are said to be the most exten-
sive in the world. The best price secured
by the old King Island Scheelite Co. was
525. 6d. per unit. Altogether the co.
raised 640 tons of scheelite, valued at
£112,472, and paid £30,000 in dividends.
Then the market became glutted and the

Victoria Alluvial Syndicate has decided
to exercise its option over a dredging
lease of 180 acres at Gretta, near the
Lisle goldfield (Tas.). The average depth
of the wash is 6ft., with about 7ft. of
free silt overburden, carrying a little
gold. Geologist D. C. Hill estimates that
there is approximately 3,000,000 c.y. of
2s. 4d. dirt available. The Lisle field
produced close on 300,0000 z. of gold,
but the source of the stuff has never

to replace expenditure out of earnings
on plant, etc. This has called for £20,000
during the last six months. The present
20-head of 12501 b. stamps is expected to
deal with 3000 tons of ore monthly. The
gross return is put at about £9OOO, and
working exes, at approximately £3500.

OBJECTS.
This Company was formed, inter alia, for the purpose of drilling wells for the
production of oil and gas from structures shown by modern petroleum geology to be
suitable for the accumulation of oil. Drilling will be undertaken only on areas where,
following the use of all the necessary tools of such modern practice, the best advice
available favours the operation. An efficient drilling plant and the best modern oil production
practice will be employed. . , , , t - Ar .
The first activity of the Company is to drill for oil on an area of approximately o4t)
acres, situated in the Parish of Beaufort, eight miles east of Roma.
HISTORY.
The history of the search for oil in the Roma district of Queensland extends over
a number of years. Several efforts have been made, mostly on incomplete geological data,
or on information wrongly applied. Nevertheless, some thousands of gallons of free on,
and over 30,000 gallons of ■ petrol from natural gas, have been obtained in the district. This
is the aggregate from a number of bores on sites none of which, on examination, gives
evidence of t>eing on a. closed structure (i.e., a structure suitable for the accumulation of oil).
They have, however, given undeniable evidence of the presence of oil, and thus provide the
first essential to the development of an oilfield. Records and core samples of every bore
put down in the district have been subjected to close investigation. Fortunately, samples of
all of the cores obtained from 150 scout bores were available, and the Geological Staff of the
Investigating Company, Oil Search Limited, has had full access thereto. All these
cores have been very satisfactorily correlated, and these data, together with information
obtained from surface surveys and scout boring carried out by the fatter Company, give a very
clear and accurate picture of. the structure of the district, and of this area in particular, in
which the geological setting appears decidedly attractive. The results of and
topographical work and the scout drilling in this area carried out under the direction of Dr.
Frank A. Moss, Chief Geologist in Australia for Oil Search Limited, form the subject
of a detailed report by Eric A. Rudd, B.Sc., Field Geologist.
It is claimed that for the first time in the search for oil in Queensland a definite
closed structure in a proved oil-bearing area has been located, and an unqualified
drilling recommendation has been given.
The Company has secured, under a favorable contract, the sole rights to drill on the
recommended area of 640 acres. There are no Vendor Shares. There is no cash consideration
except the refund of an agreed amount representing a portion of the expenditure incurred in
the geological investigation that has led to this activity.
if, however, commercial production is obtained, Drillers Limited will pay for the rights to
the oil so produced, and for rights to drill the whole area, the sum of £50,000, to be paid
to Oil Search Limited in terms of the contract —herein referred to —which sum will be
applied to Subscription at par of shares in the Company to a like amount.
On any wells' after the first well producing in this area Drillers Limited will pay to Oil
Search Limited a Royalty equal to half the amount of Royalty to be paid to the Queensland
Government.
It is to be noted, as evidence of the confidence with which this activity is undertaken,
that Drillers Limited incurs no liability in the matter _of vendor consideration in regard
to this activity unless and until commercial production is obtained. Drillers Limited will
then enjoy the full benefit of profits to be derived from oil produced subject only to the
payments referred to.
VENDOR.
The vendor, Oil Search Limited, with the permission of Roma Oil Corporation Limited,
Builders Limited (In Liquidation), Australia Oil Industries Blocks, “A,” “F” and “I,” and
others, was able to place at the disposal of its geologists a large area for investigation.
Without this it would have been impossible to have obtained the present authoritative
information, as a result of field work, in an area of about 50 square miles, regardless of the
boundaries imposed by the conditions of the Queensland Oil Prospecting Act, which places a
limit on the area of operations of any one Company.
It is by virtue of co-operation with the cited companies that Oil Search Limited placed
with confidence the recommended area referred to at the disposal of Drillers Limited.
ANTICIPATED PROFITS.
It is not wise to make any anticipation of profits in an oil activity. It may, however,
be noted that:
(1) A definite closed structure, giving one of the necessary requirements for the accumu-
lation and retention of oil, has been located. Drilling preparations are in progress.
(2) The region is petroliferous. Some thousands of gallons of oil have been produced
from several bores in the vicinity of the selected site. Dr. Moss states these latter
have demonstrated an oil horizon, but that they were not drilled on structures and,
consequently, accumulation of oil could not be expected.
(3) In any oil-producing country the proved conditions under which drilling is now
sponsored would be recognised, with the usual results that attach to a proved oil
venture.
(4) The oil reserves of such a structure as that under reference can, according to Dr. Moss,
be upwards of 5,000,000 barrels of oil, estimated upon experience in oil-producing
countries.
GEOLOGICAL REPORT.
The detailed geological report referred to includes the following:
OIL POSSIBILITIES.
Excellent and undoubted proof of the presence of oil and gas was encountered in the
Hospital Hill (Roma), Blythdale, and Roma Blocks Oil Co. Block 16 bores. The Warooby
Creek area therefore lies in a proved petroliferous province.
The showings of oil and gas in the bores cited came from coarse sands resting on
bedrock, and the oil is migratory having its probable source in the Permo-Carboniferous
sediments of thp Bowen Basin, the southerly continuation of which underlies the country to
the east of Blythdale and probably swings westward to the south of Roma. The structure in
the Warooby Creek area is in a favorable position to trap migratory oil, and there is the
added possibility of the accumulation of oil in the overlap of the Permo-Carboniferous
sediments along the edge of the basin.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.
1. A distinct and consistent set of marker beds has been established by scout drilling,
and upon these reliable sub-surface data accumulated.
2. Thirty-eight scout bores have been used to delimit accurately a closed structure.
3. This structure has approximately 16 feet of closure and a considerable drainage area.
It is highly probable that the closure on this structure increases with depth.
4. The structure lies in a proved petroliferous area and in a favorable position for
trapping migratory oil.
5. Approximately 3900 feet of drilling will be necessary to test this structure to bedrock.
6. It is recommended that deep test be drilled on this structure at the site indicated
in Figure 5.
7. No useful purpose will be served by coring this hole above 3500 feet.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Bombex”: A Melbourne paper has
been trying to revive interest in the old
method of curing rheumatism by bee
stings. Many years ago there was quite
a cult of the kind, which resulted in my
losing a small fortune hardly earned
floating N.Q. mining cos. I bought a big
house just outside Brisbane, on a long
grassy slope with a sunny aspect; and
invited applications from sufferers desir-
ing to undergo the cure. Adopting the
American method of planting stout stakes
all over the paddock, I leg-ironed the
patients to these, after taking off all their
clothes but loincloth, and shoved a
skep of bees beside each stake. Atten-
“Is the keeper alive to the fact that the lions have escaped ?”
“No, he’s dead.”
dants, masked and gloved, were in-
structed to push over the beehives and
run for their lives. Unfortunately, 1
didn’t provide enough attendants. The
result was that, when the first few hives
at the top of the hill were upset and the
bees began the treatment, the uproar and
tumult scared the people lower down out
of what senses they ever,had. One
and all tore up their stakes and bolted
for the bush. The clothing they aban-
cloned the Law forced me to return, and
it was the same with the deposits I had
very properly demanded from them in the
Further, a timber co. made me
part up for 100 6 x 4 Oregon stakes, 9ft.
long, and a large, sweaty proletarian,
wielding a huge maul, came along and
asked what about paying him for driving
in the stakes.
* * * *
“Bally”: He was a smart-looking
fellow, shrewd enough to be an auc-
tioneer, lean enough for a horseman.
While the train was stationary he came
to me and sat alongside. “I haven’t seen
a bushman for weeks,” he began. “How
do you know I’m a bushman?” 1 asked.
He tapped the back of my hand. “That’s
how,” said he. “No old-timer ever has
any hair on the back of his hands.
Barcoo rot and sunburn wipe ’em out
at the roots. You can pick ’em every
time.” I had a look at his hands. They
also were hairless on the back ; and the
miles sped past while we argued about
Spider Fallon, Tommy Nolan, Billy
Winters and horses of the past.
* * * *
“Truthful James”: Afraid I can’t
swallow that yarn about a fellow having
his clean holding ruined by .rabbits
dropped by flying eagles (B. 30/5/’34).
The average eagle flies at a height of
1000 ft., as a rule. If one dropped a
rabbit, those who learned in the mus-
ketry schools at the war that thes tate of
speed of a falling object increases as the
square of the distance, or some jolly old
tosh like that, will realise that the rabbit
would, after hitting the ground, be in
no mood for propagating the species. I
am more inclined to think that “Tie-
wire’s” cats were responsible. Usually
maintained at some expense in rabbit
country, my experience is that they like
catching young rabbits, climbing the net-
ting fences with them, and, after showing
off with their prey at the house, letting them
go again. A cat is a bored, purposeless
beast, anyhow, and half the rabbit kittens,
captured for swank purposes are released
in disgust before the homestead is
reached. .
* * * *
“Tom Willie”: I’ve never been able to
decide whether a snake makes a hole in
the ground for itself or uses the hole
made by some other animal. Bushmen
ignore the question, or show contempt.
Now, does a snake burrow? If it doesn’t
bite a hole into the ground whose hole
does it cuckoo? I once ploughed up a
wriggler in the winter ; its hole fitted it
so well that the snake appeared to have
been moulded into it.
* * * *
“Peu”: At one time and another within
recent years The Bulletin has told of
new preparations designed to immunise
those dwelling in malaria-affected dis-
tricts. In spite of experiment and
advertisement, it looks as if our old friend
quinine sulph. is the only remedy worth
bothering about. The League of Nations’
health section-has just , issued a report
which is disturbing to those who, like the
writer, had reason to think that the silent
scourge which has destroyed civilisations
was in a fair way of being mastered. It
seems to be the other way round. In
Italy the malaria mortality has risen from
60 per million before the war to 320 per
million to-day. Countries like England
—in the Fens —where malaria has not
horses and cattle. Great fires were lit
in the paddocks, and all day long —our
sandflies knocked off work at sundown-
long queues, of horses .and cattle stood in
the drifting smoke coming from the burn-
ing piles topped up with green branches.
In amongst them were kangaroos and
wallabies by the score, and I’ve seen even
the wary dingo taking his chance.

Point!”
appeared for half a century, are again
visibly' affected. The League, while giving
attention to the usual destruction of
mosquito-breeding areas, says bluntly
that more quinine is needed. The amount
necessary for the 88 malarious countries
of the world is estimated at 1390 metric
.tons. The amount produced by the Gov-
ernment of the Netherlands East Indies,
which has an absolute monopoly of
quinine production, is 600 tons.
* * * *
“Jack’s Track”: Crows see more than
man or dog. One white-eyed croaker
got bored to tears watching my pack miss
rabbits in the long grass that’s smother-
ing the Upper Hunter (N.S.W.) this sea-
son, and decided to join in by swooping
and picking at hidden bunnies and driv-
ing them with wings and beak to the
dogs. This suited everyone, and the tire-
less feathered worker never let up until
a move was made to boil the billy. He’d
then have a snack and start the ball roll-
ing as soon as the quartpot was hung
to the saddle again.
“Heresone”: “Flight Feather” is a bit
out in his dissertation on crows (B.
23/5/’34). Have often shot the fellows
that sport the white down, using carrion
as lure. And neither breed specialises in
anything. They are equally at home
with green corn, ripe figs or overripe
meat.
* * * *
“Tabora”: A friend has sent me an
East African newspaper which gives one
a very clear idea of how the uplift of
civilisation is affecting the savage. A
mission boy of Nairobi, by name Sami-
well—which has a Pickwickian flavor—
bought a paint-box, inks and paper from
the Church Missionary Society’s shop. A
little later he was arrested for trying to
pass counterfeit notes —excellent imita-.
tions of East African 10s. notes, made by
himself with the C.M.S. materials. Asked
to explain, he told the Bwana up on. the
Bench that “Necessity was the mother of
invention,” and airily departed to do his
sentence of 18 months’ hard.
* * *
“G.G.6”: Mandated Territory owners
of horses and cattle which risk. attack
from shark or crocodile when, maddened
by sandflies, they stand out in the shallow
sea to escape their tormentors (B. 2/;5/’34);
should hearken to this. After the great
floods of the early ’nineties, which prac-
tically swamped the Balonne River (Q.)
country, the sandflies arrived in billions
and nearly drove humans and wild and
domesticated animals , mad. Fortunately,
the country was mostly under sheep,
which were not so much troubled as
if I am with him he remains set until
I perform the last sad rites. If he smells
out a wriggler on his own private rambles
he first sets it, and then proceeds to
annoy the worm. He will keep on at
this game for half an hour. As some of
his catches are only frilly lizards I don’t
always bother to investigate, but I’ve
killed over a dozen blacks and browns
this season. So far Bruce has never
been bitten.
* * * *
“Wagga”: Among the old tombstones
in Longford (Tas.) cemetery I came
across this epitaph: “In memory of
Zimram Youram, a native of Cornwall,
England, who died July 6, 1848, aged
85 years.” Apart from the association of
the duchy with England in a manner that
Cousin Jacks might resent, the names
suggest that the stone may have been
raised by an enemy.
* * * *
“C. Coral”: The diving feats men-
tioned by “Corselet” (B. 16/5/’34) re-
mind one that some pretty good per-
formances below water have been put
up in Torres Strait, although the rows
of graves on Darnley Island (T. 1.) and
other places show what heavy toll the
sea has taken. Before the advent of the
dress-diver the work was done by naked
skin-divers; and, incidentally, records
of the ’sixties and ’seventies show
that Island girls were signed on to
European boats, being looked upon by
skippers as better swimmers than the
men. Various types of dress and
diving devices have been used in north-
ern waters without becoming popular.
One of the best Jap divers of the
Strait, who went out last year, used only
corselet and helmet, working in over 30
fathoms. He' had no fear of sharks.
The dress-diver, for his part, is
more afraid of the playful ray fouling
his lines, or of getting entangled in the
whiplike -.tree-growth down below. Island
skirndivers, using only swimming-
glasses, work in 16 fathoms, remaining
below for three minutes or so.
* - * * *
“Shoal Bay”: Darwin has just com-
pleted its football season. The premiers
are known as, the Buffaloes, and it would
take an anthropological-cwm-ethnological
commission to sort out their nationali-
ties. The team consists of Europeans,
abos., Koepangers, Malays, at least one
Western Papuan, and others of assorted
races and shades. All show remarkably
fine physique, despite the fact that they
drag out their existence in a climate
wherein, as everyone in the South knows,
no human being can do hard work or
take hard exercise and live.
WHEN WE TIN-KETTLED JACK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We mustered thirty strong by night, without a
sound, without a light,
In silence and the moonlight bright until
the word was given;
And then with sudden smashing blare the tins
were crashing everywhere,
And jangling cowbells rang their share, as
night was rudely riven.
There sure was music on the track
The night that we tin-kettled Jack.
Each cow with wild-eyed, startled head a
moment stood; then past the shed,
Past house and stacks, all madly fled, their
hooves like drummers beating,
While we with crash of tin on tin the house
with blatant sound ringed in,
And saw, not heard, them through that din
in vain for peace entreating.
But; still the clamor did not slack
The night that we tin-kettled Jack.
Determined that they shouldn’t rest, we cleared
the kitchen floor with zest,
While somebody, by loud request, struck up
a concertina;
And there we danced swift hours away, till
night was paling into day,
And morning through the windows grey
danced in with the maxina.
For no one spoke of getting back
The night that we tin-kettled Jack.
We drank their health with three times three
and wished the pair prosperity,
And he was proud as he could be, while she
was shy and glowing;
And as we took the homeward track, well, I,
for one, kept looking back
Where she stood hand in hand with Jack to
watch the neighbors going,
And wondered who the girl will be
The night that they tin-kettle me.
VICTORIA.

“Macropus”: In his interesting mono-
graph on the habits of the nesting kan-
garoo (Macropus nidificans) “C am Cove”
(B. 30/5/’34) seems to have quite for-,
gotten that other aberrant species, Macro-
pus incubatoris. This interesting and rare
creature carries its eggs in its pouch until
hatched, after the fashion of some of the
lower monotremes. When the eggs are
deposited the creature has to refrain
from hopping for fear of breaking them,
and simply crawls about in secluded
places. One would have thought that this
would make it easy to capture, but that
is far from the case. Its favorite haunts
at this time are in obscure pub back-
yards and under the beds in these same
hostelries, whence it is wont to emerge
at nightfall. The commonest species is
bright blue, with horns and a spiked
tail, but a correspondent has recently
recorded a pink sub-species with purple
spots. To date, no specimen has actually
been acquired for our museum at Quart
Pot Creek, but many vivid accounts by
close observers have been recorded by
the editor of the Q.P. “Banner” and filed
for future reference.
* * * *
“Herbert Dawson”: “Lanus” (B.
30/5/’34) was probably right; in the
southern N.S.W. tablelands, anyway, the
“Fancy Dave coming to a concert with his hair like that !”
“Careless cow! Told ’im to tuck it in his collar.”
black cockatoo is a notorious tree-
chewer. Recently saw one of a flock on
the head of Tumbarumba Creek carving
vigorously into a cleft in the fork of a
messmate sapling which was bending and
tossing before a roaring sou’-wester. The
forager’s curved beak was suddenly
jambed by the cleft closing. Frantically
flapping and screaming, he tried to pull
out, the other birds circling low round
him and offering vociferous advice. A
wedge-tailed eagle dropped down and
tore the struggling bird from the tree,
both landing in a confusion of wings and
drifting feathers. Before I had time to
reach them the king of the air changed
his mind, tore himself free and clumsily
made off. Cocky, though obviously in-
jured by the raider’s claws, was still in
commission.
“Wandy”: At Wandiligong (n.-e. Vic.)
a black cockatoo in pursuit of grubs
succeeded in lopping off a limb 6in.
through, which fell on a sleeping bullock.
The local butcher managed to salvage
the carcass, and special “cockatoo-killed
meat” was on sale next day.
* * * *
“De M.”: I wasn't surprised to read
of “Peng.’s” penguins at Manly (B.
23/5/’34). Possibly they have some con-
nection with the pair that nested under
a house at Collaroy (N.S.W.) in 1921.
The occupants heard a loud cackling
noise and opened the door; the queer
little fellows stepped right inside and
danced about. They made a nest of sea-
weed under the house, where two eggs
were laid. The birds took it in turns to
sit, and after six weeks two chicks were
hatched. After four months the family
departed, and wintered abroad. August
saw them back, cheerily announcing their
arrival at the back door of the same
house. When the door opened the whole
lusty family danced into the room. After
one more hatching the parents moved
their domicile, and are possibly among
the colony at Smedley’s Point.
* * * *
“Lofty”: The huge leaf-mould nest of
the N.Q. scrub turkey makes a great
vegetable patch. Last year I spread one
out, and on it planted 52 tomato plants.
From these I picked 15 cases of first-
grade fruit, which netted me eight bob
a case ; and ourselves and most of the
neighbors had tomatoes for over two
months. Last week, from the same
patch, I picked a summer crop of maize,
sufficient to keep the chooks going for
three months. Next week in go another
52 tomato plants, and I’ll bet on another
15 cases.
=i= * * *
“M.H.H.”: Re this ambergris argu-
ment. A Maorilander who possesses a
piece of the real Mackay and a fox-
terrier has taught his dog to locate any
of the stuff that might be around when
they stroll down the beach. The amber-
gris found thus pays for smokes, periodi-
cals and an occasional flutter on the
horses.
* * * *
“Verri”: Don’t kookaburras kill
snakes (B. 23/5/’34)? A Double Bay
(Sydney) resident recently had a young
kooka sent to her from the country ; she
was worried about suitable food for the
youngster until the matter was taken out
of her hands. A company of local jacks
invaded the garden each day and con-
tributed tasty items to the captive’s menu.
The owner looked on approvingly until
she discovered a couple of small snakes
wriggling into the violet border, after
which a close watch was kept on any-
thing arriving par avion. The friendly
visitors had apparently an inexhaustible
“Me ’usband sez you remind 'im of Mae West.”
“Does ’e, now ? Y’ll ’ave ter tell ’im to come up and see me some time.”
supply of diminutive wrigglers to draw
upon, and each day one or more had
to be killed as soon as delivered. The
cut wing of the pet was allowed to grow,
and soon afterwards it flew off with the
visitors, with no regrets on either side.
* * * *
“W.P.T.”: The fox is a past-master at
the art of feigning death. I caught one
recently in a rabbit-trap, and, after hitting
him on the head, watched him stretch
out apparently dead. I released him
from the trap and reset it, but when 1
turned to skin him he’d vanished. Another
time I wounded one with a pea-rifle, and
after a short chase my dogs caught him.
I hit this one on the head, too, and he
performed his death kicks. But when I
took my eyes off him he also sprang to
life. On this occasion the dogs saved
his skin for me.
“F.Y.7.”: “D.E.” asks (B. 30/5/’34)
where .Sarah Bernhardt saw “on a large
prairie in Australia” a flight of “brilliantly
colored birds that filled the sky,”
and what were the birds. Sarah
saw this spectacle, as thousands
of others have done, somewhere
on the western plains of N.S.W.
or Queensland, and the birds
were the beautiful rose-breasted
cockatoos which Australia
knows as galahs. On the upper
Barcoo, years ago, when the
bindei burr, which was one of
their favorite foods, was carpet-
ing the plains, great flocks could
be seen busily feeding on the
ground. When the alarm was
given the whole flock would
rise as one fowl, and, wheeling
in their thousands, alternately
showing their rose breasts and
the slate blue of their wings and
back feathers, would give a
color display which Sarah rightly
referred to as “dazzling.”
“Mac”: Our mascot in the trenches (a
goat) didn’t get sozzled like “P.R.’s” kan-
garoo (B. 16/5/’34); shell-shock finished
him. He could duck to cover with the
best of us when a strafe was on, but the
long strain told after a while, and then
a shell-shocked goat worked in reverse.
Instead of ducking he ran out to meet
the shells, and took shelter when the
show was over. He ran out once too
often.
**' * *
“Tufter”: Anyone lifting up his voice
in song about the bonny red deer in
Maoriland these days runs a risk of
instant extirpation. The brutes were
introduced to the Shivery Isles some 60
years ago. Since then they have so multi-
plied that they have become a menace,
especially in the South Island. In
the high country forests they strip the
trees of their bark ; hence water erosion
and the ruining of farm lands. The Gov-
ernment is subsidising a party of expert
hunters under Captain Yerex to work in
the South Island areas. Since the begin-
ming of summer these men have shot
10,000 deer in one district alone.
* * * *
“Maluka”: Crossing over from the
Cloncurry River to the Leichhardt long
ago with rams for Avon Downs, we
camped at. some native wells in spinifex
country. There were about half a dozen
of them —rock holes full to the brim
and apparently permanent, as it was
drought-time. Cattle started to come in to
water towards evening. Amongst them
was a big merino wether as wild as a
brumby ; I got him into our hessian yard
at night with the rams after a lot of
trouble. We were well down in the Gulf,
five months on the track, all cattle
country for hundreds of miles. He was
sweet mutton ; but, like the water in the
native wells, where did he come from?
* * * *
“J.H.”: Touching this tree-growth con-
troversy (B. 2/5/’34). Every day I pass
along a track where survey-marks on
trees cut into the wood are at the same
height as when made 35 years ago, but
blaze-marks on the bark of bloodwoods
are now nearly 15ft. above the place ori-
ginally cut. This seems to prove that the
bark is drawn up as the tree grows, but
the wood at butt remains stationary.
* * * *
“Woombye”: Blacks on the tidal
creeks and rivers of Queensland prefer
to bogey when the tide is on the ebb,
their theory being that his sharkship is
too busy watching he doesn’t get stranded
or pocketed as the water recedes. Fish
bite better as the tide is going up; per-
haps they are also imbued with the
safety-first idea.
* * * *
“King T.”: Contrary to general be-
lief, oysters do not thrive in polluted
waters. When the purity is affected the
oxygen content is reduced. Experiments
show that water with an oxygen supply
of less than 12 p.c. will destroy
nearly all oysters inside of 50 days. The
minimum oxygen content that will sus-
tain oysters is between 25 and 33 p.c.
* * * #
“Barangkali”: Torres Strait Jimmy has
some very clearly defined rules about
turtle-hunting. When the breeding sea-
son approaches, canoeloads of Islanders
daily search the ocean for signs of
mating turtles, and when discovered it
is an easy matter to slip a rope over the
flippers, both turtles being captured and
taken alive to the beach. A huge fire
is lighted. The female turtle is killed,
the meat being used in the feast; but the
male is kept alive. Men with bull-
roarers, whistles and rattles, grotesquely
dressed, dance around the turtle, creating
a tremendous din. This, of course,
makes the reptile foolish and easy to
capture, and every turtle in the sea will
be affected by the reactions of their lone
relative on the beach. It is fed on small
portions of a dog, a rattan collar is tied
around its neck, and it is dragged around
by the Islanders, cajoled and beaten with
sticks until it makes some effort to fol-
low its captor. It now has the dog com-
plex, so it is taken to the water’s edge
and released, to spread the complex
among other members of its family.
FROM LYONS POINT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I sit at ease where swaying trees
Draw patterns in the sky,
And watch the questing, cresting seas
Go helter-skelter by.
From Barrier chain across the main—
Dear sea beyond compare!—■
Oh, is it castles built in Spain
You follow, lads, out there?
Or ladies true that wait for you
By bluff or bay serene,
And sent you word to rendezvous
Per land breeze yestere'en?
Or mermaids gay that dance and play,
For ever out of reach,
But lead you on—the old, old way!
To break you on the beach?
This way maybe, or that —ah me!
Befogged is journey's end;
And so with men, O comrades; we
Know not what Fate may send.
Best take one’s ease where swaying trees
Draw patterns in the sky,
And watch the questing, cresting seas,
And let the world go by!

LIFE INSURANCE SUPPLEMENT
A Life Policy
Owing to the wide range of investment
needs it covers, and the security and
returns it offers, life assurance has grown
to be such an important factor in social
economy that it has become a necessity
of modern life. It has had its growing
pains, like all other businesses, of course.
Still, because our life offices have mostly
developed along sound lines, and have
not failed to profit from their own and
others’ experiences, they are now able
to offer what every man ought to make
the sheet-anchor of his investments, of
which more will be said presently.
Early Developments
The first office to set up here was the
Australian General in 1836, followed by
the clumsily-named London-controlled
Australasian Colonial and General Life
Assurance Annuity and Endowment
Society in 1839—Francis Kemble was
sent out as secretary. But it was not
until after the wreckage of the financial
storm of the early ’forties —the Bank of
Australia had failed—was cleared away
that the foundations of what is now the
biggest mutual life office in the Empire
were laid in Sydney. That was when
the Rev. W. H. Walsh, T. Holt, T. S.
Mort, C. Lowe and W. Perry formed the
Australian Mutual Provident in 1849. It
had a credit balance of £265 at the end
of its first year. No claims arose during
the first three years, and it has never
looked back.
Of the existing offices, the next in the
field was the National Mutual, founded
by Colonel Templeton in 1869. It was
the first office in the world to introduce
the non-forfeiture principle, which caught
on like wildfire, and became known
throughout America as the Australian
system. In 1897 the National took over
its old competitor, the Mutual Life of
Australasia, also formed in 1869. Of
recent years it has quickened its growth
by swallowing what remained of the Aus-
tralian business of the Equitable of
U.S.A. and the New York Life.
Then came the Australian Widows’
Fund, in 1871, followed three years later
by the Colonial Mutual, which was the
first Australian office to extend the non-
forfeiture principle to Industrial con-
tracts, and which pioneered group
assurance. The Australasian Temper-
ance and General, now prominent
amongst Australia’s five big mutual
offices, made its first appearance in 1876,
and the City Mutual, with which the
name of the late George Crowley will
always be associated, set up in 1879.
It was about this time that the failure
of the Albert and the European, two big
English concerns, led the British Board
of Trade to demand substantial deposits
from life cos. This had its repercus-
sions in Australia, where the formation
of new mutual offices ceased, and the
proprietary, or co-operative, cos. began
to make their appearance. Chief of these
was the Citizens’, formed in 1886, along
the same lines as the big English Pruden-
tial, which, after spreading to many
other parts of the world, recently set up
here. About 20 years later the Citi-
zens’ became the Mutual Life and
Citizens’, having absorbed the purely
mutual M.L.A. and then the Widows’
Fund. The inducement which led to the
amalgamations was a guarantee, backed
by the Citizens’ capital (then £20,000),
that henceforth costs would not exceed
15 p.c. of the total income. In 1895
came the Australian Metropolitan, which,
like the Provident of Dunedin (M.L.),
which also operates here, has developed
into a sound and progressive little con-
cern. The Australian Provincial, formed
in 1912, got into a backwash. It has
been set firmly moving forward by E. S.
Paul, and it promises to be a vigorous
competitor of other offices.
Post-war Experiences
Of the litter of life offices which sprang
up during the post-war boom, only the
Australasian Catholic, founded by E. J.
Mooney, has developed what looks like
regular bonus-paying capacity.
In 1920 there were 20 offices writing
life assurance in Australia. Five years
later the number had grown to 35 ; it
was 28 in 1931, failures and amalgama-
tions having accounted for the difference.
Extravagance and heavy lapses were the
chief causes of the collapses that
occurred.
The worst example was the Federal
Life and General. It was formed in
1923 ; then it took over the People’s
Prudential, which had set up in 1896,
and for many years had paid regular
bonuses to its policy-holders and a steady
10 p.c. div. to shareholders. The very
sick Federal Building and its three feeble
associates Commonwealth Traders’,
Australian Traders’ and the Empire Life
and General —were also taken over by
Federal Life. Within a few years the lot
were in liquidation. The solid and
revenue-producing assets of the People’s
Prudential had been pledged beyond
redemption. Not only were the events
that led up to the liquidation a scandal,
but the delay in proceeding with the
liquidation itself comes near to being
another scandal. There should be no more
hesitation on the part of the N. S. Wales
Government in appointing an arbitrator
to deal with the whole matter. There is
precedent for this in the cases of the
Albert and the European. The policy-
holders, a large proportion women, have
not only lost the savings of a lifetime;
it may be no longer possible for many
of them to get accepted as a first-class
risk.
Though it is difficult to make the class
pf disaster just referred to impossible,
much could be done by legislation to give
policy-holders more protection. Queens-
land has done it
“Good job for the missus I paid my life-insurance premium this morning !”
At the end of last year Queensland’s
Labor Government passed an Act mak-
ing it compulsory for cos. doing both
Ordinary and Industrial business in that
State to establish separate funds for each
department. Also surrender values on
Ordinary policies which have been three
years or more in force have been
made compulsory. The minimum sur-
render value has been fixed at 65 p.c.
of the office reserve value of the policy.
Things Worth Considering
One of the first things a person about
to purchase assurance needs to remember
is that he is really buying into a partner-
ship, the future profits of which he will
share with others in the business. So
that a reliable idea may be formed as
to how the partnership is likely to turn
out, it is necessary to consider not
only the premium, or price charged, but
also to carefully examine the financial
standing and past performances of the
office concerned, as well as details of the
particular class of policy or contract
which it is proposed to take out.
A successful office is one whose funds
are genuinely accumulating at a faster
rate than the growth of liabilities under
its policies. Its soundness depends upon
the nature of its assets, of course. These
need to be carefully considered in rela-
tion to any surplus announced—it is the
amount by which the Assurance fund
exceeds liabilities under policies. While
the actuary calculates and certifies the
amount of liabilities under policy con-
tracts, it is not his duty to report upon
whether the assets are really worth their
book value. It is possible, therefore, for
an office to show a surplus (it is the
source from which bonuses are paid)
which exists only on paper. Hence a
sharp watch needs to be kept for any-
thing in the nature of doubtful or over-
valued assets. When the growth in lia-
bilities under policies is greater than the
amount by which actual incomings
exceed outgoings, the gap may be
bridged by writing up the book
value of goodwill or some other will-
o’-the-wisp. In sound bonus-paying
offices the assets are conservatively
valued, and substantial reserves, in addi-
tion to the Assurance fund, are usually
accumulated. These reserves supplement
the earnings of the fund, and therefore
enhance bonus-paying capacity.
Where Bonuses Come From
The chief sources of bonuses are (1)
interest, (2) mortality, (3) loading and
(4) miscellaneous minor items. In calcu-
lating the premiums, or price to be
charged for the various assurance con-
tracts, an office assumes that its funds
will earn a certain rate of interest, after
deducting taxes, etc., that it will experi-
ence a predetermined rate of mortality,
and that the cost of handling the busi-
ness will not exceed a fixed percentage
of the premium income. If its funds
earn more than the assumed rate, and
its mortality experience is less than that
expected, and it succeeds in handling the
business at a lower cost than allowed
for, then it derives a margin of surplus
from all these sources, and the rate of
bonuses will depend upon the size of
the aggregate surplus.
Interest Rates
Two things have led to the use of a
low rate of interest by life offices in
valuing their contracts. One is the fall
in the actual rate of interest realised.
The shoe first pinched in this respect
after the crisis of the ’nineties, when
bonuses were either reduced or stopped
altogether for a while. But the market
rate of interest began to climb early in
this century, reaching over 6 p.c. for
first-class securities during the post-war
boom, and with it the rate of bonus rose,
too. Now that we have entered upon a
period of cheap money again, bonuses
generally are being adjusted in accord-
ance with the reduced rate of earnings.
The other thing which has led to use of
a low rate of interest in valuations is the
popularity of uniform compound rever-
sionary bonuses (bonuses allotted on the
sum assured plus previous bonuses).
These compound bonuses demand that
the cash surplus available for division
amongst policy-holders shall increase
rapidly. The method of valuing by a low
rate of interest meets this need by lock-
ing up .during the early years of a policy
sums which would otherwise be avail-
able for distribution, and by releasing
them with interest later on.
Mortality
The profit derived from the mortality
experience arises from what is known as
suspended mortality. If the lives assured
survive for a longer period than was
counted upon, then the office receives a
greater number of premiums, and has the
use of the funds it has accumulated to
meet the policy when it does become a
claim for longer than was figured.
This applies only to whole-life contracts,
of course. Some offices provide for the
suspension of premiums on whole-life
business upon the assured attaining the
age of 80 years or thereabouts.
The mortality tables most extensively
used are the British offices’ Om., which
covers the 30 years to 1893, and the
Institute of Actuaries’ Hm., compiled
in relation to a period ended Dec. 31,
1863. Recent Australian experiences are
only between 50 p.c. and 60 p.c. of the
mortality expected under these tables.
A joint committee of the Institute and
the Faculty of Actuaries has just com-
pleted an investigation into the mortality
of assured lives in Britain during the six
years 1924-1929. The results disclosed
some rather astonishing facts. For the
period covered they showed that endow-
ment-assurance mortality was lighter
than whole-life, that the mortality in with-
out-profits business was slightly less than
for with-profits contracts, and that there
was little difference in the rates of mor-
tality experienced by medically-examined
and non-medically-examined lives. It all
means that premium rates generally are
higher than they need be, albeit a
good office returns to the holders of its
with-profits contracts the amount which
they have been overcharged, and more,
in the shape of bonuses —and few people
mind. It does, however, demonstrate
the necessity for a careful examination
of the bonus-paying capacity of life
offices. Another feature revealed by
recent mortality statistics is that females
assuring their lives could now be accepted
at slightly lower rates of premiums than
those charged for males; years ago the
premium rates for females were higher
than those for males.
Sundry Profits
During the last three or four years the
surpluses of most cos. have included
amounts of profit arising out of the un-
fortunate heavy increase in surrenders,
the surrender values (they vary with dif-
ferent offices) being less than the actual
reserve created against the policy. An-
other miscellaneous source of profit has
been the rise in the market value of Gov-
ernment securities, large wads of which
were purchased at a heavy discount a
few years ago. These two factors have
tended to offset the immediate effect of
the sharp fall in interest rates upon
bonuses. The greatest relief in this
respect, however, has been the concession
granted to life offices by the Government
in respect of taxation. Because of this,
and the extra reserves created out of
profits from lapses, etc., it seems probable
that the well-established offices will be
able to maintain bonuses on their present
scale at least.
Stability
One of the outstanding features of the
big Australian life offices has been their
stability. Although a large proportion of
their assets was represented by mortgages,
and foreclosures were numerous, they
went on paying claims as usual, including
bonus additions, throughout the crisis of
the ’nineties. They stood up to the strain
of war claims without a falter, and some
even refunded the extra war-risk pre-
miums they had collected. The only
effect of the war was temporarily to
reduce bonuses. Then came an even
worse experience, the influenza epidemic,
which kept bonuses down a little
longer. After that interest rates and
bonuses began to soar, until they were
interrupted by the big slump and the
growth in taxation.
Still, the well-established concerns con-
tinued to make steady progress, as the

Some Australian
History
From the day in 1793 when the first free
immigrants arrived in Sydney until to-day,
the steady enrichment and progress of the Aus-
tralian people have been amazing. It is a
record to compare with any similar “colonis-
ing” in any part of the world. The early
events of Australian history are known to every
schoolboy. The arrival of the First Fleet in
1788; the discovery of Port Phillip in 1802;
the first wool sent to England in 1803; a path
across the Blue Mountains discovered in 1813;
the name of Australia given to the new settle-
ment, on the recommendation of Flinders, in
1814 (a year before the Battle of Waterloo);
the erection into a Crown Colony in 1824;
Darling Downs discovered in 1827; Melbourne
founded in 1835; Mew Zealand separated in
1841 ; first Representative Constitution granted
in 1843 ; rising indignation against convict
transportation, leading. to Final Abolition in
1850 —just one year after the A.M.P. Society
was founded.
* *, =i= *
From then on, Australian development was
rapid. Within two years of the A.M.P.
Society’s humble beginning, payable gold was
discovered by Hargreaves, and in the same
year Victoria was separated from New South
Wales. The next year the first steamship arrived
from England. The first railway—that from
Sydney to Parramatta —was opened in 1855,
when the A.M.P. was “well in its stride.”
* * * *
Few people realise that the roots of the
A.M.P. go so deeply into Australian history.
The Society had good fortune from the begin-
ning, for no member died during the first three
years. The first year ended with a credit
balance of £265 and 34 policies in force. By
the time the first claim was made, the funds
had grown to nearly £2000; meeting the claim
was a simple matter, and the Society never
looked back. Through “good” years and “bad”
years it continued to prosper and extend. It
grew as the little nation grew. Its funds were
used in developing the country’s resources and
in building the people’s homes. The Society
was planning to open a branch in Melbourne
when the first tramline was being laid down
in Sydney. It had opened a branch in Bris-
bane before the first mail service with America
was established; indeed, before this service
came into being, the Society had already reached
the point where it was doing £1,000,000 of
new business each year. The Society had built
up a great business before the first artesian
bore was put down, and before silver was dis-
covered at Broken Hill. It had helped many
a farmer to buy his property, and to render his
future secure, long before the first shipment of
wheat was sent oversea.
By the time the Boer War began the A.M.P.
was in so strong a position that it was able
to loan some of its funds to the colonial Gov-
ernments of the day to equip and despatch
their contingents, and to accept the risk on
the lives of those who volunteered. It had
become, in fact, financially impregnable, and
was even then a national institution with assets
valued at £16,500,000.
When the Commonwealth was established in
1901 the Society’s assets had grown to
£18,000,000. In 1905, realising that there was
a demand for life assurance amongst the pro-
vident wage-earning classes of the community,
the Society opened an Industrial Department,
and this, too, has grown and prospered with
the years, bringing comfort and a sense of
security to hundreds of thousands of homes.
With the beginning of the Great War in
1914, the A.M.P. found itself once again called
upon to mobilise its resources to help the
nation. In all it loaned the Commonwealth
£14,000,000 to aid in prosecuting the war,
evidence of the financial strength and vigor
attained by the members when pulling together
as a Society. In the Great War, also, the
Society freely insured the lives of those who
volunteered. The little tree planted in 1849
had grown so vigorously that it was able to
provide shelter to the extent of £3,000,000 to
the descendants of its members who gave their
lives to the Empire, and this without any im-
pairment of its strength and stability.
Since the war, the A.M.P. has maintained a
vigorous part in financing the nation. It has
lent its reserves to State and Commonwealth
Governments, and to municipalities, to help
them in their efforts to solve the problems of
unemployment and development. The A.M.P.
has a full faith in Australia’s great destiny. It
is strong because the Australian people are
strong. It has braved all the winds of adversity,
and has built up for its members assets worth
£93,000,000, because the Australian people have
withstpod the same winds, and it will go on
gathering more and more strength because the
Australian people will go on prospering.

PF/za/ would happen to your family
if your chair fell vacant?
AN unpleasant thought, but it is well for a
man to face it; what would happen to your
family if, through accident or sudden fatal
illness, your place in the family circle fell
vacant ? What provision have you made for that
possibility ?
You can make provision quite simply by
becoming a member of the A.M.P. Say that you
are 30 next birthday. You can make provision
for your wife to receive in the event of
your death (even if it should occur the next day)
by making a quarterly deposit equal to less than
10/- a week. The moment the first deposit is
made the provision is made ; the obligation to
protect your family is met. If, as you expect, you
live to a ripe old age, bonuses may easily double
the amount assured ; at least, that has been the
experience of members ; some policies have even
trebled.
A certain member assured his life for £lOOO
in 1891 when he was 32 years of age. The
premium was equal to less than 10/- a week.
When he died last year his beneficiaries received
lt is within the power and means of
almost every man to make such provision.
The man or woman who decides to invest
in Life Assurance will very properly consider
the standing of the concern with which he or she
proposes to deal. Has it the strength to withstand
the winds of adversity? Are its roots deeply in
the nation’s soil ? What is its history as regards
meeting the needs of its members?
The assets of the A.M.P. are valued at
made up of investments, in the
Government, municipal, public and private
undertakings of the people. The Society is as
strong as the nation itself. Every policy issued
by the Society has the backing of these assets,
which belong to the members as a whole.
During its 85 years the Society has paid out
over 120 millions to members or their represen-
tatives; last year the sum was six millions
sterling, and after that there was a surplus with
a reversionary value of over 4! millions to be
distributed as bonuses.
The wise man (or woman) will ask the
nearest A.M.P. office to send a counsellor to
discuss membership, or he (or she) will send for
a copy of “Investing in Happiness,” a book that
tells the whole story.

Assurance Company Ltd.
Incorporated 1895.
Extracts from the Chairman s speech at the last Annual
General Meeting: —
“Our Actuary carefully investigates the Company’s
position every year, and his report for 1933 discloses a
surplus in each Department which is more than sufficient
to provide for Bonuses to policy-holders on the same
basis as that declared in each of the past five years.
“After the Valuation for the year 1928, the Ordinary
Department Bonus was raised to a rate ranging from
£l /10/- to £3 per cent. on the Sum Assured, and since
then there has been no diminution in that rate of Bonus,
notwithstanding the loss of interest following upon legis-
lation and the difficult times during the intervening years.
“Policy-holders will appreciate the fact that their Bonuses
have been maintained, and they will, I hope, also
appreciate the fact that the Bonus Certificates will be
ready for issue almost immediately after the close of this
Meeting.
“The Company continues to make profits for its policy-
holders, and with normal growth these profits should
lead to even bigger Bonus distributions than those which
they at present enjoy.”

There has thus been a steady increase in
the amount of business in force at the
end of each year, despite the contraction
in the amount of new business written
and the sharp increase in surrenders, etc.
The figures for Industrial assurance show
a similar trend.
The progress is further reflected in the
combined balance-sheet figures of 22
Australian offices, including the five just
referred to:

Over the three years the growth in the
book value of the net tangible assets was
over £26,572,000. There was also a
growth of over £130,000 in the value
placed upon goodwill and other intan-
gibles by those who were unable to make
ends meet. A feature which catches the
eye is the growth of £7,625,000-odd in
loans on policies. The life cos. have thus
proved to be a haven of refuge for many
of their sorely-tried policy-holders.
Modem Trends
A lot more attention is now being
given to life assurance as an investment,
and many attractive schemes have been
introduced. In the past, however, it has
been found that few of these establish
themselves firmly, because the simpler
forms of ordinary whole-life and
endowment assurance contracts, possess-
ing liberal options of all kinds, fulfil
most requirements. One thing recent
developments have shown is that a life
policy in a sound office means that the
money is always available when due.
It is not frozen.
It takes years to accumulate an estate
through toil, thrift and compound in-
terest, especially when the rate of interest
is low, like it is at present, A life policy
guarantees completion of the instalments
should the assured’s years of work, etc.,
be cut short by death, and so protects
dependants against the absence of an
estate. When the age for retirement is
reached, life assurance makes available
another great investment objective,
methodical liquidation of the investment
fund in the form of an annuity. In
this way it is usually possible to secure
a much larger income than by putting the
proceeds of the policy into any other
sound investment. A lot of attention is
therefore being given to annuities these
days.
The most familiar form of life assur-
ance is the Ordinary whole-life contract,
with or without profits. It is taken out
mainly for the purpose of providing for
dependants after the death of the assured.
It provides the maximum amount of
cover at the lowest annual cost. The
premiums, however, run on so long as
the assured survives, and it may be diffi-
cult to find the money in later years.
This difficulty may be overcome by
accepting a paid-up policy for a reduced
amount that would participate in future
profits, or by taking out a whole-life
limited payment policy. Though the
annual premiums are a little greater, the
difference is very slight for the usual
ages at entry, provided the number of
premium payments is not very small.
A recent development has been the
issue of special whole-life and endow-
ment assurance policies carrying disa-
bility benefits. Speaking generally, the
big Australian offices are inclined to look
askance at the extension of these benefits,
which involved life cos. in the U.S.A. in
substantial losses ; but that was largely
due to overextension of benefits at too
low a premium. If caution be observed
in the selection of risks and in admission
of claims, this business should prove to
be a very valuable adjunct to Ordinary
life assurance, says J. J. Lohan, president
of the Actuarial Society of Australia.
The next most widely-adopted form of
contract is endowment assurance, also
with or without profits and other embel-
lishments. Its popularity arises from the
wide variety of investment objectives to
which it can be applied. It is a contract
for the payment of a specified sum, plus
bonuses, if any, at the end of a stated
period, or at death, whichever occurs
first. Some of the purposes to which
such a policy can be applied are (1) pro-
vision for family or other dependants,
(2) provision for old age, (3) investment,
and (4) education of children. But all
these objects cannot be secured by a
single endowment assurance policy. It
is true that, by taking out a policy to
mature at, say, age 65, a man can com-
bine 1 and 2. But such a contract is
of little use as a provision for the edu-
cation of children. Here the need arises
early, presses heavily for a few years,
and then passes away. Conversely 3 and
4 may be combined, but only at the ex-
pense of 1 and 2. It is thus necessary
to select a short-term or long-term con-
tract, or to take out more than one pojicy,
whichever best suits the purpose in view.
A recent development, and now one
of the most popular forms of contract, is
the family income or heritage policy.
The plan combines ordinary life assur-
ance with temporary annuity benefits. If
the life assured fails at any time within,
say, 20 years, an annuity will commence
at once and continue for the remainder
of the 20 years, at which time the full
sum assured will be handed over, to-
gether with bonuses, if any. This class
of contract has filled a real want, the
need for high cover at comparatively
small cost during the years when a mar-
ried man’s responsibilities are greatest.
The simplest form of annuity con-
tract is a life annuity. It provides for
payment of an annuity annually, quar-
terly or monthly during the lifetime of
the annuitant, there being no death bene-
fit. The refund annuity grants a simi-
lar income on a somewhat reduced scale,
but, in the event of the annuitant’s death
before the income payments amount to
the original premiums paid, the income
continues to be paid to a beneficiary
until the full amount of premium pay-
ments is returned. A cash refund an-
nuity is similar to the refund type, ex-
cept that an adjustment in the event of
premature death is made in cash instead
of in the form of continued payments.
A survivorship annuity is contingent,
and commences upon the death of a
second party, the annuity usually being
purchased while both are alive. A joint
and survivorship annuity provides an
annuity for life to two or more partners
jointly, payable until the death of the
last survivor.
Another form of contract to which at-
tention has been turned lately is without-
profit assurances. Favorable mortality
has allowed some offices to reduce their
premiums for this class of business,
which is also being featured by some of
the younger concerns paying small
bonuses or no bonuses at all. Doubtful
of the future of bonuses, some seek the
highest amount of guaranteed assurance
at the lowest cost.
Yet another feature, and one likely to
remain, has been the growth of group
assurance, by which large numbers of
employees have been able to secure
assurance on terms more favorable than
would be available to them as individuals.
All cos. now seek this class of business,
which figures very prominently in the
volume of new business written by some
of them. The plan, which is directly
related to the payroll, originally provided
for the issue of a blanket policy, cover-
ing a group of employees, without medical
examination. But medical examination
is now mostly insisted upon, and indivi-
dual policies are issued. It has been a
definite step towards overcoming the chief
objection to Industrial assurance, namely,
its high cost.
The expensiveness of Industrial policies
deprives their owners of most of the
bonus benefits enjoyed under an Ordinary
with-profits contract. It is the result of
the service, extended to the assured by
sending agents each week to collect
premiums. However, the history of
Industrial assurance shows that since the
beginning of this century it has been
largely transformed from a business con-
ducted solely for profit into one which
now exerts a widespread influence for
social uplift. Many of the lower-paid
workers either will not or cannot afford
the time to attend to the payment of
premiums themselves. Increased bene-
fits, sweeping concessions to policies
about to lapse, liberalisation of conditions
and the privilege to transfer into the
more profitable Ordinary department are
some of the concessions which have been
extended to Industrial policy-holders.
All the usual forms of contracts can be
taken out under an Industrial policy.
Assuring Children
Assurance for the benefit of a child is
not always taken out on the life of the
child; it is on the breadwinner’s life
more often. If an endowment, the policy
thus makes provision for a lump-sum

payment upon the child reaching a cer-
tain age, or upon the death of the father.
The advantages gained in assuring this
way cost little more. Furthermore, the
payments which may be made by an
office on the death of an assured child
are limited by law. Excepting that it
may return the premiums in full, the
office must not pay more than £5 on the
death of a one-year-old child nor more
than £45 in the case of one nine years
old. The aim is to make it impossible
for parents to benefit by a child’s death.
A policy may be taken out on the life
of a young child and the death risk is
covered after he or she reaches the age
of 11.
In the case of endowment assurance
on an 11-year-old child, the premium for
£IOO, payable in 24 years, would be £3
11s. in one office; on the life of a parent
aged 31, same term, it would cost only
about 10s. a year more.
In the “Policies” section of this supple-
ment will be found references to two
or three special forms of children’s assur-
ances. They are good examples of means
of providing for the education, etc., of
a child at a certain age, or the encourage-
ment of thrift in young people when
they come of age.
Where a parent’s aim is to provide for
a child should it be orphaned, an ar-
rangement for a temporary contingent
annuity may be arranged with some Aus-
tralian offices.
For a parent aged 35 to secure an
endowment of £IOO for a four-year-old
daughter when the latter reaches 21, or
an income of 10s. a week should the
parent die before the child comes of age,
an annual premium of about £8 is asked,
which ceases upon the child reaching 21
or at the parent’s earlier death. If the
child dies before reaching 21 premiums
are returned without interest.
Under yet another kind of child’s
policy a parent may assure his or her
life, the policy to be payable when a
child reaches a selected age, premiums
to cease and the sum still to be payable
should the parent die before the child
reaches that age. Premiums are refunded
with interest if the child dies before the
selected age.
The Amount of Cover
One of the most difficult questions to
answer in connection with life assur-
ance is: What amount of cover should
a person carry? Some American cos.
argue that a man may safely purchase
Ordinary life assurance for an amount
equal to 15 times his yearly income at
age 20. Another American notion
is that 25 p.c. of a man’s income is
needed for his personal expenses, includ-
ing assurance, and that the value of his
life is therefore the present value of
75 p.c. of his future earnings. The fact
is that no rigid rule can be applied. Each
case varies according to the circumstances
surrounding it. For the average person the
best measuring-rod is: How much can I
afford? As in personal assurance, the
amount of cover in business assurance
should fit the needs of the individual
cases. In a partnership the amount of
assurance purchased on each life is usu-
ally in proportion to the amount which
would be needed to buy the holding of
the deceased from his estate.
Tontines
A tontine is a form of life annuity,
originally devised by Lorenzo Tonti, an
Italian banker, about the middle of the
seventeenth century as a means of raising
Government loans. The general features
of a tontine with regard to money are
in some respects similar to those of a
joint tenancy with regard to land, being
characterised by community of interest
and equality of profit, with the right of
survivorship attached. The income from
the common fund contributed by the
persons composing the tontine is divided
at first among all, say 50 persons. When
one dies, his share passes, not to his heirs
as part of his estate, but to the 49 sur-
vivors of the tontine, and so on continu-
ously, the profit increasing to each sur-
vivor as the number diminishes, until
the last survivor takes the lot.
The thing was first applied to life
assurance by the Equitable of New York
in 1860, and later prohibitive legislation
was passed in some of the States. Mean-
while the Equitable had brought the prin-
ciple to Australia, where it became more
or less the vogue during the dying de-
cades of last century. The A.M.P. and
other Australian offices denounced it, and
shunned that class of business, notwith-
standing that many modifications were
introduced, such as the granting of days
of grace and of a guaranteed cash sur-
render value for policies.
Incidentally, two other American cos.,
the New York Life and the Mutual Life
of New York, had also set up here in
the late ’seventies or early ’eighties, and
they wrote a lot of policies. But the
scandals connected with assurance busi-
ness in America at the beginning of this
century led to restrictive legislation there
and to repercussions here, and our three
American visitors ceased writing new
Australian business.
Policies Suited to the Want
The A.M.P. in its first year—lß49
showed a credit balance of £265, with
34 policies in force. By good luck no
claim was made until the society was
three years old, when the funds had
crept up to nearly £2OOO. At last
balance they totalled £89,598,000.
In the-interval 1,021,183 policies have
been issued. The society’s rate-book
covers dozens of different types of con-
tract. And still new forms of assurance
are being evolved to suit present-day
needs.
There is a growing demand for special
women’s policies. Whole-life contracts
are not attractive to a single woman
with no dependants; her main concern
is provision against want in later years.
The A.M.P. recommends a deferred
annuity or an endowment in such a case.
A woman 25 years of age may obtain
an annuity of £SO, payable from age 60
until death, for an annual premium of
£9 7s. lid.; or payable from age 55 for
a premium of £l4 2s. 6d. If assured
dies before annuity is entered upon pre-
miums are refunded.
If an endowment assurance were taken
out, it would become payable at the
woman’s death, or upon reaching a cer-
tain specified age. If the age be reached,
the sum assured, with accrued bonuses,
could be used to purchase an annuity, or
dealt with in any other way. A short-
term endowment is also a good way of
providing for a trip abroad.
The A.M.P. also features educational
endowments. Say a father aged 30 next
birthday wishes to make provision for
the education of his baby son when the
latter reaches 17. For an annual pay-
ment of £22 17s. 6d. ,each year the
society will contract to pay a lump sum
of £3Bl, plus bonuses, at the end of 16
years, or alternatively four annual pay-
ments of £IOO each, bonuses being added
to the first payment. Should the father
die before the son reaches 17, the policy
matures straightway.
Probate policies, which are ordinary
whole-life or endowments taken out for
the specific purpose of providing for
death duties, are also being pushed by
the A.M.P.
Many men jib at life assurance
because they imagine that, should they
live to an old age, they will pay so
many premiums that the policy will be
unprofitable. Notwithstanding the fal-
lacy of the idea, life offices have en-
deavored to meet these people, and some
very attractive policies—called limited-
premium contracts —have been evolved.
The National Mutual has issued a
special leaflet embracing such policies.
Premiums are payable for 20 years or
until death; should the assured survive
20 years premiums cease, but the policy
participates in bonuses until death.
The premiums can be arranged to
cover the period of a man’s most active
earning power, and the policy becomes
payable, free of further premiums,
should he die before completion of the
premium-payment term. Under the
National Mutual’s tables a man aged 30
may assure himself for £IOOO for an
annual premium of £3O 3s. 4d. The
maximum total amount of premiums
payable for the full 20 years is £603 6s.
Bd., which is exceeded by the sum
assured to the extent of £396 13s. 4d.
Bonuses would increase the amount of
the policy.
There is a definite paid-up value
attached to this policy. If three , annual
premiums have been paid, for example,
the paid-up value would be three-
twentieths of the sum assured, plus
bonuses.
The National Mutual also issues an
attractive children’s policy. Where a
child, aged five, has a 30-year-old father,
an assurance for £IOOO payable at death
of the child after it comes of age can
be obtained for an annual premium of
£lO Bs. 4d. If the child should die before
reaching 21 all premiums are returned;
if the father should die before the child
comes of age all liability for premiums
is cancelled until the child reaches 21.
From age 21 the policy starts to par-
ticipate in bonuses, the child assumes
responsibility for the premiums and there
are several options which may be exer-
cised by him.
The policy may at his option be con-
verted into an endowment of smaller
amount or a whole-life limited-premium

3 -YOU may go-but the “LEGACY”
Policy stays AND pays.
4 The “LEGACY” Policy is a
“Declaration of Independence” for
your family.
5 The returns from the investments
you leave may fluctuate —the re-
turns from a “LEGACY” Policy
never will. Cash available im-
mediately death takes place.

contract, or it may be converted into a
paid-up policy. It is a very flexible con-
tract.
In view of the uncertainty attached
to investments these days, the T. and G.
(the initials by which the Australasian
Temperance and General is known) has
had a rush on endowment and annuity
policies. The office’s family-income con-
tract, which provides for a payment at
death, an income for the balance of the
term and the full sum assured at the
end of the term, is also in demand. The
value of probate policies is becoming
more widely appreciated.
Group assurance, which enables pre-
miums in the Ordinary department to
be paid in small weekly instalments
through the assured’s employer, is
another special activity of the T. and G.
During its last year this office wrote a
number of short-term endowments, the
premiums being paid in one lump sum
—another indication of the dearth of
satisfactory investments elsewhere.
The Prudential, the big British office
that came to Australia a few years ago,
is writing a large volume of annuity
business.
Life offices have found that a woman
who has safely passed the child-bearing
age usually lives longer than a man;
indeed, any woman over 40 has to pay
more for ah annuity under the tables of
most offices.
For a lump sum of £IOOO paid into
the Prudential at 40 a man can obtain
an annuity of £56, or a woman £53, pay-
able until death. At 60 a man may, for
the same sum, draw £B4 a year; in a
woman’s case the annuity would be £73.
These propositions have many attractions
for people with no dependants and only
a small capital.
Under another Prudential table the
office will repay the amount of the pur-
chase money, less annuities) already paid,
should the annuitant die within five
years. Under this contract a man aged
60 may buy for £IOOO an annuity of
£76 10s. Another variation: The office
will undertake to pay an annuity until
the purchase money is refunded, or until
the annuitant dies, whichever is the
longer period. For £IOOO the annual
income to a man aged 60 would be
£72 10s.
The Prudential also writes joint and
survivorship annuities. For £2OOO pur-
chase money a man aged 55 and his wife
aged 60 may draw £l2O a year between
them ; when one dies the survivor derives
the whole benefit until his or her death.
The Australian Metropolitan Life is
putting its special child’s assurance policy
into the window again this year. The
scheme is to secure for a youngster the
low premium which naturally results
from early assurance. The parent pays
until the child reaches 21, after which
it accepts responsibility for the commit-
ments. For an annual premium of £lO
a parent can insure a child turning six
for £B6O, payable at 60, or at death after
21. If the child should die before com-
ing of age the premiums would be re-
funded with interest at 4 p.c. This par-
ticular contract would carry a guaranteed
surrender value of £162 at 21—£12 more
than the premiums paid in. This can be
claimed by the parent should he desire
to terminate the policy when the child
reaches 21, and, for a small extra charge,
the policy is free from premiums until
the child is 21, should the parent die in
the meantime.
The Australasian Catholic offers very
attractive Industrial assurance, as well as
policies earning increasing bonuses in the
Ordinary department. The office is
featuring endowment assurances —which
become payable at a certain age or at
death before reaching that age. With life
assurance increasing in demand as an
investment, endowment policies have
grown greatly in popularity over the past
five years.
The Colonial Mutual continues to
feature its “Legacy” policy—one of the
guaranteed monthly income variety. The
day the assured dies his family starts to
benefit. The office transacts a large
volume of Industrial business, and in-
troduced the non-forfeiture principle to
this class of assurance. It was also early
in the Australian field with group assur-
ance.
Nursing service is extended to Colonial
Mutual Industrial policy-holders. The
society also writes accident and sickness
contracts, annual bonuses being declared
in respect of these.
The City Mutual chiefly writes Ordi-
nary whole-life and endowment contracts;
this is plain life assurance without any
frills. There is still a great demand for
these contracts; indeed, nearly every
new kind of policy is a variation or com-
bination of the principles of such policies
with those of an annuity.
The M.L.C. offers a form of mul-
tiple endowment assurance with full
participation in the profits. This is the
B.P. table. Instead of the endowment
being paid by the office in a lump, it is
spread over the selected term of years,
the first instalment being paid at a
selected age. In the event of death before
that age the sum assured becomes pay-
able immediately. If death occurs after
several instalments have been paid to the
assured, the balance becomes payable at
once. The policy participates in bonuses
until the selected age is reached, and un-
paid instalments also participate.
Australian Life Offices Reviewed
A.M.P. —Australia’s first life office con-
tinues to show healthy figures and. to
declare satisfactory bonuses, besides
handing large sums to the Treasury. The
amount (£743,857) paid in taxes last year
was £78,373 lighter, owing to a little
relief on the property rate.
Investments and the income therefrom
have been the main worry of sounder life
offices since slump commenced. Interest
reduction, taxation and possible deprecia-
tion of securities caused the A.M.P. to
reserve £1,463,621 in the Ordinary de-
partment against these items during
1930-31. In the Industrial the assumed
interest rate was brought down to 3 p.c.
in order to maintain future bonuses. The
ratio of bonuses distributed to premiums
received in the O.D. dropped from 58.1
p.c. in 1928 to 45.8 p.c. in 1931 ; in 1932
it recovered to 46.3 p.c., and last year
to 46.8 p.c.
The surplus for bonuses in all depart-
ments last year was £113,037 stronger,
thanks mainly to the cut in the tax bill:
Ordinary. Industrial.

1932 . . . . 2,470,310 259,751
1933 . . ■ . 2,566,322 276,776
Net addition to the O.D. funds was
£2,529,892, an improvement of £336,423.
Total income in this department was
£9,322,373 (up £177,806). New business
put on the books was £2,005,762 higher.
The office allows 18.7 p.c. of the pre-
miums for exes. etc.; excluding taxes,
only 12.3 p.c. was absorbed in this way
last year. Of the year’s total income in
the 0.D., including net interest earnings,
8 p.c. was taken by exes. Deducting
taxes, the interest return was a shade
under 4 p.c., as against the 3 p.c. assumed.
The society’s £93,073,807 of funds in
all departments at Dec. 31 last was in-
vested as follows: Public securities, 55.5
p.c.; mortgages, 22.4 p.c.; loans on
policies, 17.3 p.c.; premises, 1.7 p.c.;
other assets, 3.1 p.c. Assurances on the
books totalled £220,170,041.
National Mutual Life. — This associa-
tion (don’t refer to it as a “society” if
you want to keep the peace) has its head
office in Melbourne, and out of a board
of six five directors are titled. It is a
solid and progressive office, gathering
nearly half its income outside Australia.
Notwithstanding this country’s position
in the eyes of the world three years
ago, the figures kept very steady, and
policy-holders have benefited.
Total income for 1933 (£4,662,815) im-
proved £185,800 compared with 1932,
and was only £321,062 below 1929, the
association’s peak year.
Last term the net interest return on
funds was £3 19s. lid. p.c., an improve-
ment of Is. lid. over 1932, but a drop
from £5 6s. lid. p.c. in 1930. In 1928
the office lowered the assumed interest
rate from 3| p.c. to 3 p.c., so there was a
margin of nearly 20s. p.a. last year to
help swell bonuses. Likewise the amount
allowed by the actuary for exes, was
15.3 p.c. of the premiums, but the per-
centage actually absorbed was 12.7. The
cost of running the business has remained
almost steady over the last three years.
Premium charges have always been on
the low side.
Bonuses covering the trienniums to the
dates in the table have been declared as
follows:
1925 •• •• £2,118,974
1928 . . • • 3,013,518
1931 . . • • 3,577,833
The next valuation published will be to
Sept., 1934. In the meantime interim
bonuses have been on a slightly reduced
scale compared with 1931.
There was £36,243,175 of funds in the
window at last balance ; they were in-
vested 43.7 p.c. in public securities,
23.4 p.c. mortgages, 15.5 p.c. loans on
policies, 4.4 p.c. freeholds, 13 p.c. other
assets.
M.L.C. —The Citizens’ is Australia’s
largest co-operative office; in addition to
the assurance funds there is £200,000 of
capital to back policy-holders’ contracts.
Shareholders have to show more than £4 of
profit for every £1 they take themselves ;
so a low expense rate (not to be more
than 15 p.c. in the 0.D.) is assured. The

Safe and Profitable—
A CATHOLIC POLICY
• Old age or untimely death terminates a man’s earning-power,
but matures the life policy.
G Think of your dependants, and the time when YOU will be
dependent. With a Catholic whole-life or endowment contract
you can’t go wrong. Your premiums earn bonuses, which accumu-
late as the policy matures.
• The company’s funds, assumed to earn 3-| p.c., actually
returned nearly 4 p.c. last year!
0 Take out a Catholic policy and you have a front-rank invest-
ment. The office directs attention to The Bulletin’s criticism
(10/1 /’34).
• In its tenth year the Australasian Catholic Assurance Co.
commenced paying BONUSES OUT OF PROFITS. Few
offices in the world can beat that performance. Policy-holders
are entitled to 90 p.c. of the profits.

co. exercises discretion in its hunt for
business. But its income has fluctuated
very little during the slump, last year’s
revenue (£2,071,868) in the Ordinary
branch being only £37,404 below the
1930 peak year.
Premium income in both departments
(£2,032,953) advanced £64,285 last year,
being the highest recorded to date. The
jump in total income was £78,730. Exes,
accounted for 8.6 p.c. of this in the
Ordinary branch and 26.5 p.c. in the In-
dustrial ; on Ordinary premium income
alone the cost was 13.4 p.c. The disposi-
tion of the co.’s funds is very conserva-
tive, 83 p.c. being in Government stock ;
nevertheless the net return was high at
£4 ss. 7d. p.c. in the O.D. (3s. 3d. better
than in 1932), and £1 ss. 7d. more than
the rate assumed.
There was a strengthening in the
amount of bonus distributions last year,
as these figures show:
1929. 1931. 1932. 1933.
Ordinary .. £692,946 £660,967 £552,326 £556,512
Industrial.. 76,730 66,022 70,530 74,851
The benefit of the taxation rebates should
enhance bonus prospects for the current
year.
Loans on policies are low at 8.7 p.c.
of the assets.
T. and G.—This society has had a
non-stop career of progress over the past
decade. Last year’s premium income
(£3,052,254) was a record, beating 1930
(the next-best year) by £64,361. In 1923
total income in the O.D. was £747,049 ;
last term it was £1,716,881. The Indus-
trial branch raked in £1,141,979 in 1923 ;
last term the figure was £2,135,912.
Industrial assurance is thus an unusually
big feature in the T. and G.’s activities.
Apart from the unavoidable downward
trend in interest earnings, the figures
generally have shown steady improve-
ment. Have a look at these surpluses:
1930. 1931. 1932. 1933.
Net surplus:—
Ordinary ~ £398,612 £389,768 £393.592 £400,640

tingencies, bonuses on the same scale as
in the previous year (equal to 1931 rates
in the 0.D.) were handed out.
The net return on funds last year
averaged £3 16s. lOd. p.c. (up 9d.), show-
ing a surplus of 16s. lOd. p.c. over the
3 p.c. assumed in both departments.
Excluding taxes, exes, took 17.4 p.c. of
the premiums in the 0.D., as against
17.1 p.c. in the two preceding years.
Costs absorbed 35.6 p.c. of the net Indus-
trial premiums.
Of the funds 63.9 p.c. is in public
securities. The co. finds good publicity
value in attractive premises, and these
represent 9.9 p.c. of the assets. Loans,
23.8 p.c., and cash, etc., 2.4 p.c., make
up the remainder of the funds, which
totalled £18,655,218 at Sept. 30 last.
Colonial Mutual. —During the term
to Dec. 31 last this office wrote
£1,021,333 more new business in the
Ordinary department than in the previous
year. Net premiums (£1,652,201 in this
section) were £159,117 higher. Notwith-
standing the extra energy involved, the
expense rate (excluding taxes) was 24.5
p.c. of the O.D. premiums, as against
24.6 in the preceding year. In the Indus-
trial branch costs ran off with 32.7 p.c.
of the net premiums as against 32.3 p.c.
The society counts on its funds in both
departments earning 2>\ p.c. Here is its
actual experience over the last half-dozen
years:
Tax Interest p.c.
Interest Income p.c. Mean Funds,
and Rents. Tax. Interest, Gross. Net.
£ £ etc. £ s. and. £ s. and.

1933.. 693,309 103,582 14.9 417 4 4 3 8
The percentage figures above are indica-
tive of the sudden inroads of the tax-
gatherer into all life offices’ earnings.
There was a little relief last term ; of
each £IOO of interests and rents,
Governments took £l4 18s., a drop
of £2 4s. compared with 1932. But it
still amounted to 3s. in the £1 of invest-
ment income. The net return on mean
funds improved 7s. lOd. p.c., a hearten-
ing movement.
Realisations of securities turned in a
profit of £128,450 during the term. The
surplus available for policy-holders ex-
panded by £106,590 in the O.D. and
£BI9B in the Industrial. Ordinary bonuses
are to be increased.
City Mutual. —George Crowley,
under whose guiding hand this society
made remarkable progress, paid his last
premium during the year. William
Bennett, formerly Victorian manager, has
taken over the reins.
.... The office mostly attracted those people
who don’t mind paying a little more
for their assurance provided they are
handed a bit extra weight when the
claim becomes payable. The City
Mutual handed out so much extra weight
in this way that for many years it claimed
to have paid larger bonuses than any
similar institution in the world.
For a long time the society specialised
in mortgages as a means of employing
its funds. In 1932 just under half was
invested this way. Last term they had
got down to 45.6 p.c. of the funds, the
swing now being towards Government
stocks and shares, debentures, etc.
During good times interest earnings
were far in excess of the 3| p.c. which
the office assumes its funds will earn.
In 1932 the return dropped to 3.27 p.c.,
mainly owing to the disorganised pro-
perty market in N. S. Wales. But last
term investments were again turning in
slightly more than the assumed rate, and
thus contributing to bonuses.
Bonuses in 1932 ranged from £2
17s. 6d. to £4 ss. p.c. on whole-life con-
tracts ; indications are that they should
not go much lower. The society has
been steadily recouping in contingency
reserve any asset wastage that depression
may have brought about.
Australian Metropolitan Life. —
This, another semumutual office, has
shown steady figures through a difficult
period. It runs two branches —Ordinary
as well as a very energetic Industrial.
Ordinary income was slightly higher last
term at £105,990; Industrial improved
to £162,491.
Funds stand at £667,511 in the O.D.
and £591,971 in the Industrial. The
office assumes that the Ordinary funds
will net 3 p.c., the same as the larger
offices; even in the Industrial the co.
values as low as 31 p.c., and the margin
of loading has been increased. Actuarial
reserves were strengthened by £43,992
in this operation, thus brightening the
outlook for bonuses, which have re-
mained steady at from 30s. to 60s. p.c.,
according to the age of the policy.
After deducting taxes, last year's net
return on investment of the funds re-
covered to 3.6 p.c. in the O.D. and 4.1
p.c. in the Industrial branch —highly satis-
factory figures. After deducting taxes,
exes, took 22.2 p.c. of the net Ordinary
premiums last year.
Funds at balance-day were invested
45.2 p.c. in Government stocks, 21.6 p.c.
in mortgages, 19.7 p.c. freeholds, 7.4 p.c.
loans on policies, 6.1 p.c. other assets.
There is £50,000 of share capital.
Australasian Catholic. —Out of all
the post-war concerns, this is the
only one which commenced paying
bonuses that were actually earned
within the first dozen years of its
life. Its assumed rate of interest-
earning has been brought down to 31
p.c. in both the Ordinary and Industrial
departments, while last year’s premiums
were gathered at an average cost of
38.2 p.c. in both departments. It has
been a splendid achievement.
Last year’s interest earnings showed a
margin of Bs. p.c. over the rate assumed.
With favorable mortality experience and
less worry attached to investments, the
outlook for policy-holders continues to
be bright.
Over 80 p.c. of the assurances are in
the Industrial branch. Policy-holders in
this section benefited by bonuses at the
rate of 255. p.c. on whole-life contracts.
In the O.D. the rate was 455. p.c. on
whole-lifes and 30s. p.c. on endowments,
irrespective of age. On new policies these
rates are very satisfactory.
Mortgages represented 58.7 p.c. of the
assets last balance-day, as against 82.1
p.c. three years ago. Government
stocks, bought mostly below par,
accounted for 26.3 p.c.
A.P.A. —There has been a great re-
covery here over the past half-dozen
years. The Australian Provincial is one
of the younger co-operative offices that
are heading towards satisfactory bonuses
—the way is now clear, all establishment
exes, having been cleaned out of the
accounts. Policy-holders have the back-
ing of £257,028 of share capital in addi-
tion to £2,585,690 of assurance funds and
reserves.
Of the assets, £1,381,027 was invested
in public securities last balance day. Net
tangible assets totalled £2,975,262, as
against assurance funds of £2,545,661.
The expense rate showed a further
satisfactory movement last term: it
dropped from 22.6 p.c. to 20.2 p.c., and
compares with 40.1 p.c. in 1926. New
business remained steady, though re-
newal premiums showed a shrinkage—
a sign of the times, many finding it
hard to keep up their payments. If such
people manage to keep their policies alive
they should have few regrets later on;
when the basis of assumed interest return
is brought more into line with present-
day anticipations, policy-holders _ should
be on a favorable wicket.


ASK YOURSELF THIS QUESTION
WHEN WILL MY CHILDREN
BE SELF-SUPPORTING?
When you have answered it, ask yourself this —
How am I to Guarantee Their Maintenance
in the meantime ?
When you have done this, you will find that you need a NATIONAL MUTUAL
IMPROVED POLICY OF INCOME ASSURANCE, which, in addition to other
benefits, will supply the income for the period it is required, if your death prevents
you from providing it yourself.
AN ILLUSTRATION—
The following benefits could be secured by a man aged 30 nearest birthday for an
annual premium of £29/13/4 during 20 years of assurance, and £23/6/8 thereafter: —
In the event of his death within the term of 20 years:
(1) An immediate cash payment of £lOO, together with the full amount of
vested bonus additions.
(2) The regular payment to his family of £l5O per annum by monthly
instalments of £l2/10/- for the balance of the term of 20 years.
(3) A final cash payment of £lOOO when the monthly instalments cease to be
payable.
Or on survival of the term of 20 years:
An assurance of £lOOO payable with bonuses at death.

What is the Australian record high jump for
a horse off the turf; horse’s name, owner and
when and where record was made ? —1758.
Record is held by Coal Dust, which cleared
7ft. llin. at Wangaratta (Vic.) on November
8, 1932. The horse was then the property
of John Phillips, Mount Keira, Wollongong
(N.S.W.).
What causes the intense blue of the Blue
Luke at Mt. Gambler (iS’.T.) ? Is it due to the
mineral contents of the water ? —1728.
The generally accepted view is that it is due
to a reflection of the blue color of the sky in
the deep clear water of the lake. There is no
special peculiarity about the composition of
the water that would account for it.
Particulars of aeroplane which left Sydney
for Melbourne and was thought to be lost in
the mountains or the Tasman Sea ? —1738.
The Southern Cloud left Sydney early on
March 21, 1931, but failed to arrive at Mel-
bourne. An intensive search by a number
of aircraft and many land parties was carried
out over an extensive area for a considerable
time, but without success, and to this day there
is no authentic clue to the ’plane’s fate.
Although I am in perfect health and only 21,
my hair is rapidly falling out. I do not suffer
from dandruff to any great extent. What can
I do about it ? —1765.
Scalp massage with the fingertips should be
beneficial, with an occasional singe if the hair
is thin. Using a bay-rum lotion for the former
purpose, rub well into the hair roots after
brushing or a preliminary dry massage, once
daily. With the fingertips moistened in the
lotion, employ a pinching movement over the
head from nape of neck and temple towards
the crown. This stimulates circulation and
brings essential nutriment to the hair cells.
Shampoo once weekly with coal-tar soap and
hot water, and use a vegetable oil pomade as
a dressing when the scalp is dry.
Remedy for pr unit is ? —1824.
This disease may be general or local, the skin
being congested with papules; itching persists
as a definite symptom of trouble. Although
chronic cases seldom respond fully to treat-
ment, the simple form yields in some measure
to an antacid diet. A soothing unguen't may
be used to relieve local irritation. Do not
aggravate the condition by scratching, indulge
in a tepid soda bath at night, and dab affected
parts with the following lotion night and morn-
ing : Bismuth subgallate 1 drachm, distilled
witch-hazel 4 drachms, glycerine of lead 2
drachms, calamine lotion to 4oz. Use zinc
oxide and starch powder to dust on during the
day.

ceiver, to receive signals from a broadcasting
station 40 miles distant ? (2) If so, where could
I obtain one, and approximate cost ? (3)
Particulars of suitable aerial and earth ? —lB5B.
(1) Should be possible with a good aerial
and earth and a sensitive pair of headphones.
(2) Miss F. V. Wallace, Royal Arcade, Sydney;
receiver, 255.; Lissen headphones, 13s. 6d. (3)
It should consist of at least 75ft. of 3/20
copper aerial wire, carefully insulated at its
points of support, erected at as great a height
as possible and well clear of near-by objects
such as trees and buildings. A kerosene-tin
will make a good earth if buried in moist soil.
The earth lead must be soldered to it.
(1) Are short-wave receivers less susceptible
to static than broadcast sets ? (2) Will a short-
wave receiver operate successfully on a small
aerial? (3) Will a three-valve battery-operated
short-wave set bring in Australian stations at
speaker strength ? (4) Where could I obtain
a circuit diagram, instructions and parts for
a three-valve battery-operated short-wave set ?
—lB3O.
(1) Generally speaking, the lower the wave-
length the less the static. (2) Yes. (3) De-
pends upon the wave-length, distance and the
hour; under favorable conditions, yes. (4)
From Miss F. V. Wallace, Royal Arcade,

/ reside in Vic. and wish to go fishing in
Queensland. Nantes of river mouths front
Maryborough to Bowen where rod-, line- and
surf-fishing can be obtained ? Nantes of
nearest towns and places of accommodation .
1740. . .
The principal rivers discharging into the sea
between Maryborough and Bowen, with the
nearest city or town, are: Mary and Burrurn
(Maryborough); Elliott, Burnett and Kolan
(Bundaberg); Calliope (Gladstone); Fitzroy
(Rockhampton); Pioneer (Mackay), and Pro-
serpine (Bowen). There are other tidal streams
within reasonable distance of the towns men-
tioned. Gladstone and Bowen are situated on
the inlets of Port Curtis and Port Denison re-
spectively. Rod-fishing and line-fishing are goou
in all the rivers, and surf-fishing is obtainable
from ocean beaches in the neighborhood.
What family does the grey mullet belong to ?
What are the principal species, and are they all
good food fishes ? —lBB3.
They are members of the family Mugilidce,
and about two dozen species are known in
Australian waters. Nearly all are valuable as
food fishes. The so-called sea mullet ( Mugil
cephalus ) is one of the most important fish
marketed in N. S. Wales; it occurs in enor-
mous quantities in inlets, as well as in the
open coast, and is captured by net-fishermen
throughout the year. The sand mullet, or talle-
galane (Myxus elongatus), of N.S.W., is less
valuable as a food fish, although at times
plentiful in the markets. Other allied species
are the flat-tailed or fan-tailed mullet ( Mugil
argenteus), the diamond-scale mullet (M.
waigiensis) and the silver mullet (M. georgii ).
(1) Easiest way of nibbing down 22ft. yacht
hull preparatory to repainting ? Old paint is
not thick, but surface is pitted. (2) Any way
of whitening discolored suit of sails ? Have
tried scrubbing. —lBll.
(1) Use pumice and a weak solution ot
washing-soda. If badly pitted or rough rub
down first with “wet or dr.y” sandpaper dipped
in soapy water. Wash surface thoroughly and
let it dry before painting. (2) Wash thoroughly
in clean, fresh water in which has been dis-
solved a small quantity of washing-soda. After-
wards bleach the sails in the sun, spreading
them out on clean, dry grass. If mildewed
dab the affected parts with weak chloride » of
lime solution, taking care not to let it touch
the eyelets, cringles or other metal parts. Then
rinse out in clean water and bleach for several
days in sunlight.
I wish to take up art-metal work in my spare
time. Nothing that needs casting, but small
things like jewellery and beaten ash-trays, etc.
What tools will I require to get, and what are
the easiest metals to work ? —lB7B.
A steel modelling tool, a small hammer, a
mallet, shears, two or three small files, a pair
of dividers, a variety of punches, sand bag and
a piece of strong thick felt, collet and planish-
ing hammers and a blowpipe for simple sol-
dering. Pewter is the easiest metal to work,
but copper and silver are within the scope of
the amateur.
The roof of my house was originally painted
red. 1 painted it with a rejuvenating paint, a
mixture of lime-salt and alum, but it peels off.
Is there anything I can do to make the paint
stick and keep white ? —1770.
In the paint you have used there is no bind-
ing medium to hold the ingredients, two of
which are soluble in water and.therefore would
be lost after the first heavy rain. Best plan
is to repaint with a linseed oil-bound paint
of the sort specially prepared for roofing, first
scraping olf the refrigerating paint.
Details concerning the man after whom
Townsville (Q.) was named ?■ —1880.
It was named after Robert Towns, who was
born at Long Horsley in Northumberland on
November 10, 1791. He was apprenticed in
early youth on a collier, eventually became
master of a vessel, and in 1827 brought his
own ship, The Brothers, to Australia. In 1842
he settled in Sydney, founding the firm of
Towns and Co., and became a pioneer in the
South Sea trade; he also took up land in
Queensland, and was the first to introduce
cotton cultivation on an extensive scale, farm-
ing a plantation of 2000 acres, on which he
employed 260 South Sea islanders for several
years. He was connected with the Bank of
N. S. Wales, and was a member of the N.S.W.
Leg. Council. He died at Cranbrook —now a
public school —on April 11, 1873.
(1) Is Taree (N.S.W.) a thriving and pros-
perous town ? (2) Would it be advisable to
buy a refreshment-room and confectionery busi-
ness there ? —1729.
(1) Taree is progressive and up-to-date and,
speaking generally, an excellent business town.
(2) Hard to say. Refreshment-rooms and con-
fectionery businesses do well there. Can’t
advise regarding the particular establishment
you have in view without knowing all about it.
A list of pleasant-sounding abo. names for a
house that is high up, among trees, near a creek
and which commands a good view ? Would
Wdhroonga be suitable ? —lB9l.
Wahroonga means “our home.” Others
which might suit are Akuna, “running water”;
Attunga, “a high place”; Bunyarra, “good” or
“sweet"; Carcoola, “gum-tree”; Carinya, “a
peaceful home"; Coolangatta, “a fine view”;
Elimatta, “my home”; Gooyong, “a camp”;
llowra, “a pleasant place”; Karrorung, “a
little creek”; Leumeah, “here I rest”; Moola,
“a shady place”; Moonya, “a dwelling”;
Murrirundi, “a nest in the mountains.”
Who was the composer of “The Holy City,”
and titles of other songs by the same composer ?
-1898.
Michael Maybrick, who wrote as “Stephen
Adams.” His other compositions included
“Star of Bethlehem,” “Nancy Lee,” “The Mid-
shipmite,” “Alsatian Mountains,” “The Little
Hero,” “A Warrior Bold,” “The Valley by
the Sea” and “Children of the City.” He was
born in 1845 at Liverpool (Eng.) and was
known as a concert singer before he made a
name as a song-writer.
(1) Conditions of the Laura Bogue Luff man
prize for best original one-act play ? (2)
Amount of prize? (3) Judges? —lB6l.
(1) Plays should be between 3000 and 5000
words long, and should take not more than
half an hour to read. Entries close October 1,
1934. Manuscript must be signed with a nom
de plume, accompanied by a sealed envelope
containing nom de plume, real name and
address of writer, qnd sent to Joan Mcllrath,
Boomerang-street, Turramurra, Sydney, with
entrance fee, Is. (2) £lO. (3) Doris Fitton,
Harry Green and Francis Jackson.
Approximate date of Chippendale’s furniture
productions? (2) What were his outstanding
periods and variations ? —1879.
Chippendale’s work dates between 1740 and
1780. He worked mainly in mahogany and
satinwood, and his early style shows strength
and stability, with a very simple grace and
beauty of line. His second period was markedly
Gothic, with pointed arches, quatrefoils, pillars
and fretted patterns, much less suited to furni-
ture than the early designs. The third period
was influenced by the Louis XV. furniture,
and was rococo with shells and scrolls. Later,
when the fashion for Chinese goods and
lacquer work came to England, he turned out
pagoda-like pieces. His earliest work is the
most valuable, but even the Chinese and rococo
pieces have the grace of design which marks
the great craftsman. He published a book of
furniture designs, which have been employed,
with a little variety, by master craftsmen ever
since.
Population (give figures for both males and
females ) of the six Australian State capitals
and Canberra and Darwin at the 1933 census ?
—1763.
Sydney: 591,234 males and 644,133 females;
total, 1,235,367. Melbourne: 464,886 and
527,162; total, 992,048. Brisbane: 143,545 and
156,237; total, 299,782. Adelaide: 147,939
and 164.690; total, 312,629. Perth: 99,299 and
108,165; total, 207,464, Hobart: 28,356 and
32,052; total, 60,408. Canberra: 3841 and
3484; total, 7325. Darwin: 909 and 657; total,
1566.
How to make passion-fruit essence ? —1792.
Scoop out the fruit and place seed and
juice in a preserving-pan, then add half their
bulk in good jam sugar. Make very hot, but
do not boil, and keep hot for half an hour.
Transfer to a jelly bag, and drain out all the
clear juice. Return to the pan, bring to just
under boiling point for ten minutes, then fill
quickly into hot sterilised jars or bottles. Close
with hot corks and melted wax, or new rubbers
and the usual tops. If sterilisation is perfect,
the juice will keep well; a few fresh passions
added when used will help to restore the flavor,
which cooking tends to destroy.
Recipe for a polish for dress-shirts and
collars ? —1720.
Melt together and mix well 4oz. white wax,
stearine and 2oz. spermaceti. Cool, and
make into cakes. After ironing the articles,
and while still warm, rub briskly with one of
the cakes until the linen shines. Give a final
quick, light ironing if necessary, but the rub-
bing should be enough. The following polish
may be rubbed on irons or rollers, and will
impart a handsome gloss: Melt together 200
parts Japan wax and 200 parts paraffin wax,
then add 100 parts stearic acid. Cast into
moulds to form cakes of convenient size for
handling.
Recipe for home-made toilet soap ? —1748.
Take 51b. mutton-fat which has been clarified
and freed from salt and impurities, a lib. tin
of caustic soda, 1 quart water, 2 tablespoons
each of ammonia and powdered borax, 4oz.
glycerine and -j-oz. oil' of lavender. Dissolve
the soda in the water all night, melt the fat to
as low a temperature as possible so that it can
be worked without hardening, then beat it very
slowly into the soda lye. Add the lavender,
borax, ammonia and glycerine slowly in that
order, beating well between each. Then whip
hard for a few minutes. Mould into shapes
or bars and set aside to harden. May be
colored with a few drops of cochineal or
laundry blue.
What was the exhibition of Australian paint-
ings held in London in 1898, who organised
it, and where? Anything of outstanding in-
terest about it ? —1589.
Julian Ashton and the late B. R. Wise brought
the matter of an exhibition of the work of
Australian artists in London to the notice of
Dame Eadith Walker, who gave £750 to the
trustees of the N.S.W. National Art Gallery for
this purpose. The trustees undertook the re-
sponsibility, and had permission from the
Government to supplement Miss Walker's gift
if necessary out of the annual grant to the
Gallery. The exhibition was held in the Graf-
ton Galleries, London, during April and the
beginning of May, 1898, and was well received
by the press. The first three Conders exhibited
in England were hung in this show, one lent

Gallery.
I have two large scenes in water-color by H.
Tebbitt. Can you tell me anything about him,
and what is the value of the pictures ? —1552.
Tebbitt was born in Paris, of English parents,
and studied and gained much of his experience
in the leading art schools of Europe. He ex-
hibited in various Continental and English ex-
hibitions and at the Royal Academy of 1882.
Toward the end of the ’eighties he came out to
Queensland, and his first work there was pur-
chased by the Brisbane Art Gallery. Later he
came to N.S.W. and did a tremendous amount
of work, most of which was sold through the
agency of a dealer named Aldenhoven at his
shop in Hunter-street, Sydney. His pictures
are quite good ones of their kind, but the
artist’s output was so great that their value de-
pends on finding a buyer who wants a par-
ticular picture. No general idea of values can
be given.

LEAVES FROM THE PAST.
IV. —The Sheep Come ro Stay.
With the decline of bushranging and
gold-digging, active minds in Australia
began to look round for other pursuits.
Some suggested camel-raising in order
to build up the paint-brush industry, and
others visualised a vast export trade in
kangaroo-tail soup. The obvious indus-
try of rabbit-breeding occurred to no
one, for in those days a sealskin coat
was sealskin, and the coney-marten
hadn’t been thought of. The sheep,
however, had.
Macarthur said “I’m going to keep
sheep.” Others followed his example,
and Australia has been wool-gathering
ever since.
The scheme had much to commend
it. All you had to do was to find a large
slice of country and squat on it with your
flocks clustered around you. The sheep
ate the grass, and you ate the sheep. You
thus lived on the land. The deserted dig-
gings which were bound to be found
somewhere on your squatterie made
excellent waterholes, and the abandoned
bushrangers’ huts formed the nucleus of
your station homestead. The stock routes,
too, were already there, and had only to
be filled in on the map to be ready for
use.
The sheep has not always been docile.
The hardy drovers and boundary-riders
of those early times carried their lives
in their hands, never knowing when one
of their flock might turn out to be a
wolf in sheep’s clothing. Gradually, how-
ever, the flocks became civilised, and the
sheep as we know it to-day is tame and
tractable. It rarely gets its wool off
more than once a year, and then is
practically forced to it. Besides provid-
ing us with food and clothing, it can also
be used (in small
numbers) as a pet;
in quantity (photo-
graphed) it is very
handy for giving
local color to bush
scenes painted by
Australian artists in
Melbourne and Syd-
ney, and (also in
quantity) it has long
been considered an
infallible cure for
insomnia.
It should always
be kept separate
from goats, and usu-
ally is, except in
outback butchers’
shops.
Of course, black
sheep dwell in every
fold, but they don’t
dwell there long
after they are found
out.
At the beginning
of last century'there
were 5000 people in
Australia, and as
many sheep. To-day
there are about
7,000,000 people,
while the sheep
have increased to
110,000,000. This suggests that the
country is much more suited to sheep
than to man.
Perhaps it would be a good idea to
clear out and leave it to them.

“Mead’s century is very interesting, from a
left-handed point of view, more so as Mead
is in his 47th year.”— Daily paper.
Quite so! And it is even more in-
teresting from a double-jointed viewpoint,
as Mead will be 51 in 1938. Looking
at it from an ambidextrous angle, it is
doubly remarkable, as Mead will be 65
in 18 years’ time. It brings up an entirely
new train of thought if you approach the
matter with a two-eyed stance, particu-
larly as it is many years since Mead turned
21. In fact, whichever way you look at
it, Mead’s century is most interesting.

“Yes,” he said, “I do lots of reading.

“What kind of things do you read?”
“Well, I scan meters, mostly light
stuff.”
“Ah,” said the others, “a light-verse
reader. Do you do it for publishers, or
are you a critic?”
“Critic be blowed. Ido it for the
electricity department.”

UNDER FALSE COLORS.
“In one of the public rooms, blocks of
wood are treated to look like de luxe volumes
of Dickens. The effect is most realistic.”
— “Telegraph.”
This seems a splendid plan. The
idea, no doubt, is to combat the menace
of book thieves. The real library, of
course, is kept in the woodshed and fowl-
run. Dickens’s volumes are disguised as
mallee roots, Shaw’s plays masquerade
as ironbark, and Wells’s books look like
chips for the bath-heater.
Galsworthy’s works make an excellent
henroost, and if anyone can distinguish
between Kipling and the duckpond he
must know one or the other very inti-
mately indeed.
The family find the arrangement rather
inconvenient at times, but they’ll have to
get used to it.
So will the hens.

“With a clever device the whole steeple was

THERE’S SOMETHING IN IT.
“People’s heads are full of groundless super-
stitions.” — “Sun.”
But there are some superstitions with
good grounds.
Punching a policeman, for instance,
nearly always brings months of bad luck.
The harder you punch the longer the bad
luck is likely to last.
To see a t.-p. man travelling in the
direction of your home is a bad omen.
It generally means that your furniture
will have disappeared before you get
back.
Unlucky charms often cause marriage
and, in some severe cases, bigamy ; while
a light in your house at 3 a.m. foretells
tfiat you are likely to be hit on the head
with a rolling-pin.
It is most unlucky to lose a five-pound
note on a Friday. It usually indicates
“When I get my divorce I’m
going to many your junior
barrister.”
“Well, mind you keep your
own counsel.”
that you’ll be hard up the following
week.
Even people who are not otherwise
superstitious agree that when 13 people
sic down to table it is very unlucky—for
the one that pays the bill.

SOME AMBITIOUS SCHEMES.
“A fantastic project for cooling Japan down,
involving the diversion of Arctic currents, has
been put before the Soviet by an engineer,
Avdeyev.”— “Sun.”
Other schemes under consideration by
the Commissar for Proletarian Brain-
waves include a plan to draw the sun a
million miles nearer the earth. The emi-
nent Soviet research worker Serge Offis-
beanski has long contended that a
stronger sunlight would mean that Fiji
and Queensland bananas could be grown
without a bend in them, thus effecting
great savings to the countries concerned,
the packing of straight bananas taking up
less space.
The creation of a huge inland sea
where the Tibetan plateau now stands,
by pumping portion of the Pacific Ocean
over the Himalayas, .is the bold concep-
tion of Ivanovitch Kwytoff, who hopes
to have the plan included in the fourth
Five-year Plan. It would mean the estab-
lishment, for the first time in history, of
a big Tibetan fishing industry.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO SIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
LIGHT BALES BEST.
“Kai-Te-Pai”: “Sheepo’s” advocacy of
the heavier pressing of bales (B. 16/5/’34)
opens up a controversial subject. One
important factor has been entirely over-
looked —the attractive appearance of the
wool on the show floor.
Ostensibly the experts who buy base
their price on. the quality of the wool;
but this is only partially correct. General
appearance has an influence on prices.
A lightly-pressed bale opens up much
more attractively than a heavily-pressed
bale. There is greater lustre, and the
natural spring has not been crushed out
of the wool. Heavily-pressed wool some-
times loses its character, and bears the
appearance of carrying much more con-
dition than its lightly-pressed competitor
of equal spinning quality.
This is more apparent in, say, N.S.W.
western wool, with its red-soil content,
than the more lightly-conditioned wool
off New England country, but the differ-
ence in the latter class is only one of
degree. I have handled all classes under
varying conditions, adverse apd other-
wise, and plump solidly for the light bale.
WARP AND WEFT WOOLS.
“Sheepo”: “Merino,” in his wool-class-
ing advice'(B. 16/5/’34), says it is more
profitable to put the weft wool (under
Hin. in length) in with the tender wool.
So it is for the dealer or repacker.
Under no consideration should any
sound wool, 'of whatever staple length,
be placed in amongst wool that is either
partly or wholly tender, or in with any
that shows a break'in the staple. The
supposition that wools used for the weft
in cloth are the tender wools or those
too short for combing is a fallacy.
What might be too short for combing
in Bradford may suit the Continent. The
woolclasser is not the one to discriminate
between warp and weft wools. That is
the job for the ultimate user.
Warp wools, comprising the lengthwise
strands of the yarn in the cloth, require
good body, and need to be sound and
compact, free in growth and with sub-
stance, whether staple length of the
original wool is long or short. Weft
wools, though not spun so tight as the
warp yarn, and not having the same ten-
sion applied during weaving, must be
sound.
The wise classer will not try to differen-
tiate, but will merely handle the fleeces
as they come to him, and get uniformity.
SAVING THE EWE.
“F.L.8.”: Vaginal eversion is not
common, but is qften found when ewes
are too fat or get lazy, and after a diffi-
cult lambing. It is essential to attend to
it at once, and to do the job with the
utmost care.
To prevent blood-poisoning, wash the
protruding part with a cold-water 1 p.c.
solution of lysol, administering a drench
composed of one dessertspoon of laud-
anum mixed with 4 fl. oz. of raw linseed
oil. Then gently manipulate the organ
back into place, having first smeared it
with olive oil. The lips of the vulva are
stitched if necessary to hold it in place.
This is not done if it can be avoided.
During the “operation” it is essential
to have the ewe’s hindquarters higher
than the rest of the body. This materially
assists the process of replacing the organ
without damage.
Often one is miles from the homestead,
without the required drugs or the imme-
diate chance of getting them. Under
these conditions complete cures are often
made as follows:
Cast the ewe in some suitable spot
where the shoulders are much lower than
the hindquarters. Then wash the part
with cold water if possible. Next very
gently manipulate the organ into place.
Don't use force, as the job can always
be done without that. In the process
allow complete urination to take place,
which will stop the ewe straining. This
is most important, because the protrud-
ing organ prevents it, and it is usually
the cause of death through uraemic
poisoning, although sometimes gangrene
sets in. This done, keep the ewe cast
in position (propping with logs if neces-
sary) for at least six hours. See that the
head is in such a position that the blood
will not run to it. Cover her with green
branches in a secluded spot for protec-
tion against crows, etc.
When returning to release her, syringe
out with the 1 p.c. cold-water lysol
solution, but make sure that the bladder
is empty once more. Water well colored
with permanganate of potash will do as
a substitute for lysol.
Complete involution should have taken
place by next day, and, in most cases, she
will recover.
SHEEP AND THE BARKLY.
“Bluebush”: Writers without practical
or local knowledge keep booming the
Barkly Tableland as a sheep proposition.
There are millions of acres of more suit-
able stuff available.
Take its past sheep history. Headingly
station gave it a flick in the long ago and
dropped out early. Austral Downs went
in for the thing in big licks. Some of the
fences are still there—or were not long
ago. Avon Downs finally sold out about
1920- owing to labor troubles, distance
from markets, or some cock-and-bull
story. It was only a coincidence, of
course, that the cattle market had been
booming for years and that Avon was
good cattle country.
The writers in question stress the rain-
fall and the certainty thereof. The average
over a period of about 50 years is just
on 15in. per annum, with the absolute
certainty that not once in 20 years is
there a winter rain. Against the 5 per
cent, bonus of a winter rain we can place
the 10 per cent, certainty of a dry pinch.
Those dry periods outnumber the wet
winters by at least two to one, or more.
The grasses are good—the same old
Mitchell and Flinders which cover W.Q.,
only larger species. The whole of the
Tableland is rich in limestone and
devoid of salt or saline herbs. Weighed
one against the other, the lack of salt
places a huge debit which the lime does
not balance.
Water supplies? There are some good
holes in the rivers. There are some death-
traps. I have seen Lake Kanellan littered
with corpses. The sub-artesian water is
there in good quality and quantity. Most
writers put the depth at 200 ft. The
average of all Tableland bores is about
250 ft. And it is easier to sink 1000 ft.
in many parts of W.Q. than it is to get
down that 250 ft. on the Tableland. In
short, it is the worst drilling in pastoral
Australia, and two to three years on one
hole is nothing out of the ordinary.
There is not a flowing bore in the whole
area, and not one supply in 20 bores
rises more than a few feet when struck.
The country is for cattle —not sheep.
It is the land of big areas, which call
for whips of capital.
ARSENIC DRENCHES.
“Tumbe Munda”: A lot of sheep-
drenching recipes contain arsenic. I sug-
gest to anyone administering an arsenic
drench that he let his fingers soak in
the mixture for a few minutes and think ot
the sheep suffering what he will suffer next
day. I have never used arsenic drenches,
but I have seen sheep die from their
effects, their eyes standing out from the
heads and their teeth grinding with pain.
My standard drench is Hoz. bluestone
to a gallon of water with a little Epsom
salts. This is safe, simple and effective.
I have also used carbon tetrathyline,
which, while expensive, is simple to
administer in sc.c. doses and perfectly
safe and reliable.
One M.O.L. writer stated that there
was no known drench to destroy lung-
worms. He may be right, but a healthy
sheep will throw lung-worm off.
Twp years ago I bought a ram low in
condition, and he kept getting worse till
he was too weak to rise from the ground.
He was coughing badly. I drenched him
with bluestone and Epsom. Three weeks
later he had a dose of tetrathyline. He
improved rapidly, and there has not been
any sign of lung-worm since.
Incidentally, when drenching sheep let
them stand up. They drink better that
way and there is less chance of the dose
going the wrong way than when they
are sitting.
TELEGONY.
“Old ’Un”: “The Lad” (B. 9/5/’34) is
right in condemning telegonic influence.
He uses an unhappy simile, though, when
he states it would not be feasible for the
current crop of carrots to influence the
following crop of cabbages. He should
know that a common custom in the
canefields is to plant a crop of cow-pea
to influence next year’s cane; also that,
due to the growing of eucalypts, much
of our otherwise suitable soil is, in the
opinion of experts, unsuited for tobacco.
The only fault I have to find with his
ideas is that such things do happen. X
have known a mare, almost clean bred,
have a mule fdal. I know her follow-
ing foal had longish ears and distinct
mule stripes. Mendel couldn’t take a
hand there. There could not possibly
be any previous ass in that mare. With-
out going into tedious detail I have
known similar cases with cattle, sheep
and with goats.
“Is there such a thing as lelegonic
influence?” wrote the late Dr. W. H.
Lang. “My medical knowledge and
my scientific training tell me such a thing
is impossible. Are there ghosts? Ghosts
are only a figment of the imagination
and I know there are no such things. But
I’ve seen one!”
DAIRY-CATTLE IMPROVEMENT.
“Byron”: One of the most outstand-
ing average improvements in dairy herds
is to be seen in W.A., where 10 years
ago the quality of the stock was pro-
bably the lowest in the Commonwealth.
In less than a decade the West has
improved its cow yields from an average
of under 901 b. to 1421 b. of butter-fat per
cow. On a recent trip through the wet
south-west 1 saw herd after herd of one
type and color, obviously good-produc-
tion stock.
This change has been brought about
by the introduction of the zone sys-
tem of mass herd improvement. 9 n ! y
one breed of dairy sire is used within
huge zones in a policy of continuous
grading up. The bulls are pure and the
progeny of standard butter-fat-produc-
tion cow^.
When this scheme was adopted an
Act was passed requiring the registra-
tion of all bulls over the age of nine
months’, and power was given the Gov-
ernment to set the standard of bull which
would be registrable each year.
In bringing about the 60 per cent, in-
crease in the average b.-f. production,
1500 scrub bulls have been slaughtered
or desexed, and nearly 900 standard
pure-bred dairy sires have taken their
places.
When the two measures were first in-
troduced there was considerable opposi-
tion, mostly from vested interests, but to-
day all are agreed that the policy has
justified itself.
CHEESE—AND CHEESE.
“Kunasarta”: Australia does not im-
port cheeses as she used to, and our cheeses
are only fair to good. There seem to
be three varieties, mild, tasty and soapy ;
in Italy there are over 90. Where beet
and mutton are rare cheese is a fine sub-
stitute. In other European countries each
district has its local type, made in
peasant homes daily, as our farmers
made butter before the factory system
brought the housewife’s best efforts to
an end.
It is a matter for regret that more
varieties of ch§ese are not made here.
Rich milk, rich pasturage and other con-
ditions are all in the cheese-maker’s
favor.
French cheeses are no way behind
those of Italy, though some of the latter
are better as flavorings for biting savories,
or to be taken in a pinch with a sip of
dry wine, than as a food. Gervais and
Camembert, which in Europe might cost
Id. and 3d. respectively, cost in Sydney
4d. and 9d., making them beyond the
means of the ordinary worker. Both are
staple and nourishing foods with the
European worker. Australian farmers
might try some of these cheese novelties.
TALLOW PREPARATION.
“Horsey”: This is something most of
us lose money on. Generally the fat is
rendered down anyhow, and sold to the
local dealer for what he offers. Try
this method and test the Sydney market:
Collect enough crude tallow to make a
cask of purified product, keeping it clean.
Next, one-third fill a thoroughly clean
copper with clean water, and put in
the fat to be treated. Heat it and stir
until all impurities have sunk to the
bottom or been dissolved. Allow the
copper to boil for 15 minutes after boil-
ing-point has been reached, and then draw
the fire. Leave the tallow to cool for
30 minutes and then ladle it into a clean
cask.
Care should be taken that no water
gets in with the finished product. If it
does it will spoil all your work. The
pure tallow should be even in color.
This method may not be the recog-
nised way of doing it, but it works
capitally provided care is exercised in the
skimming. Leave at least 2in. of fat
on top of the water, to be removed when
cold and treated with the next consign-
ment. There need be no waste.
RINGING AND CLEARING.
“Jarrah Jack”: “Tree Destruction” (B.
25/4/’34) to the contrary, ringbarking is
not harmful if judiciously carried out.

After-meal Pains
Sour Acid Stomach
Griping Pains
Be Warned of Serious Danger
Suffocating stuffiness, heart palpitat-
ing, flatulence, heartburn, griping
pains, all tell of acid stomach or some
form of digestive trouble. Are you
waiting for more serious trouble to
develop such as ulceration, gastritis,
colitis, bowel weakness, the misery of
chronic dyspepsia ?
Why not let the new-principle remedy
for Indigestion, De Witt’s Antacid
Powder, stop your pain and danger
quickly—permanently ?
Sufferers say its effect is marvellous,
quick and lasting. No more miserable
pain. Back comes the old splendid
appetite.
This New-Principle Remedy
Stops Indigestion Quickly
Here are just two from a host of
letters from those once in misery
because of “neglected indigestion,”
now pain-free —thanks to De Witt’s
Antacid Powder for Indigestion.
Mrs. Laughran, of 116 Northbrook
Street, Princes Park, Liverpool, Eng.,
says:—“My husband,suffered intense
pain from indigestion. He was in very
bad pain and under the doctor. We
thought we were going to lose him
for he was getting no better. He
really was in agony, so learning about
De Witt’s Antacid Powder I sent for
some and gave my husband one tea-
spoonful whilst he was in bed in agony.
At once he went to sleep and had a
real good night’s rest, and each day he
has improved. He is a different man.
You can understand how grateful we
are for learning about your remedy. It
is the best we have tried —and we have
tried many remedies. It should be
more widely known.”
GASTRIC TROUBLE ENDED
Mr. W. Best, 152 Carlingford Rd.,
West Green, N. 15, England, says :
“For many years I was a martyr to
severe gastric trouble, and was never
free from pain. One day I read about
De Witt’s Antacid Powder, and
decided to give it a trial. I was really
astounded at the quick relief it gave
me, and I can now eat and enjoy a
hearty meal. I am truly thankful for
the relief De Witt’s Antacid Powder
has given me.”
De Witt’s Antacid Powder for
Indigestion is quite different from
ordinary purging salts or strong soda
products. The nine specially selected
ingredients of this new remedy neu-
tralise pain-causing acidity, soothe and
strengthen the digestive system and
actnlly aid the digestion of food.
Here is sound advice we give to
every sufferer from indigestion trouble.

£5O per acre to clear outright, is turned
into first-class pastures after the timber
has been ringbarked and thinned out at
a cost of £2 to £5 per acre.
The man who knows doesn’t attempt
to cut down dry timber. He burns it
down, thus doing a much quicker job, as
well as removing most of the stumps.
Burn green timber down if possible ;
if not, saw and either bark or ring
the stumps at ground level —eight to
twelve months before burning off.
In felling in big timber fall a key tree
to take several others (partly cut through)
with it. Some time before burning bash
any suckers on the stumps. When these
are dry pick a hot day with a good wind
(no gale) and light up against the wind.
In clearing, the firestick works right
round the clock.
WET-WEATHER WORK.
“Lion”: When wet days arrive remem-
ber that there is still plenty of work to
be done. Often it is left, and done in
the fine weather instead. Here are a few
wet-weather jobs:
Bag-patching; dead-wool “classing”
and/or skin-pressing; shed-cleaning and
-tidying; greasing or oiling harness,
saddles, etc. There are woolshed tables
to be scoured, sheds and pens to be
disinfected. Engines need overhaul; tools
may be repaired ready for use when
wanted, and not left out of order until
wanted. Waggons may need to be re-
paired or greased, and motor-trucks and
cars serviced, while handpieces or shed
machinery will always stand an overhaul.
It is as well to remember, too, that the
stock, especially the lambing ewes, need
more attention on rainy days than at any
other time. Their wool becomes heavy
with water, and after the strain of lamb-
ing they often become cast and cannot
right themselves.
FINDING A WELL SITE.
“Dowser”: Though water - diviners
come and go, an old rule in water-finding
still stands the test of time. All that is
needed is a little commonsense and an
old creek bed.
No creek ever runs in a straight line.
When looking for a site to sink the well
follow the course of that creek. Mark
where it sweeps away in a bow and
comes back to its original line. Any-
where along where the string of the
bow might lie, put down the well. If
there is any water about that is the place
to get it.
The theory is that the creek marks the
actual and natural drainage of the water-
shed. The water below takes the
straightest course. It does not follow
the windings of the creek above the
ground. The rule does not produce all
winners, but it is nearly always good.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“C.O’C.M.”: After a saddle has been
well oiled it can be used immediately
without fear of soiling one’s clothes if
it is rubbed all over with white of egg.
“Louden”: Save the screw caps and
tops of shaving cream and toothpaste
tubes. They are made of good tin solder.
“Mangaratta”: To waterproof boots
melt one pint of neatsfoot oil, 21b. of old
rubber and loz. of resin in a saucepan.
Apply to the boots while warm. Bottle
what is left for future use.
“W.V.H.”: Pigs do much better, and
are more economical to feed, if they
receive a well-balanced ration with plenty
of legumes, bran and other foods rich
in mineral matter. And charcoal, soft
coal dust and wood ashes, small amounts
of common salt, saltpetre, sulphur and
slaked lime are all good for them, mixed.
“Boka”: If the big swill is mixed
fairly thick the pigs do not root to the
bottom after the solid stuff and waste the
food by spilling it over the side. Divi-
sions in the trough will prevent them
from running their noses along the side
—a wasteful habit. Lips or edges on the
trough will also help to keep the waste
down.
“Bones”: “Boka” would make a better
rug by using five cornsacks instead of
four (B. 9/5/’34). Lap the front two
so that the corners will meet under the
neck. Enough spare buckles and straps
to go round a herd of 20 cows would
be hard to find, but a hank of marline
will do the trick. Tie the two corners under
the neck, another piece to go under the
belly just forward of the navel and
another under the tail about a foot below
the backbone. Don’t pass the string
round the legs, as it works down and cuts
the flesh. Make a good job of the sew-
ing—the weakest part of the rug.
“D.D.”: Old cars make good portable
oil-engines when the body is taken off
and a belt wheel is fixed on to the shaft.
This engine can be horse-nulled or trailed
behind a vehicle, and will drive separa-
?ors> circular saws > pumps, sheep-spray-
mg or -crutching machines, etc.
“Yarri”: Old horseshoes make good
hooks for the harness-room. Heat a
s hoe in the centre and twist it in the
V y Ce> so that one end can be nailed
flat the wall. The other end will stand
ou t anc j curV e a little upwards. The
s hoe also makes a bale-hook,
“Mulyan”: A Moreton Bay fig-tree
ma kes a fine shade for fowls. The trees
are prolific bearers, and the berries are
goo< i food for both chickens and pigs,
“j e Babarantiko”: Beware seed-pota-
toes w j t h “shoots rubbed off.” A small
setting of Up-to-Dates ordinarily sprout-
jn g yielded a normal crop. An equal
quantity of the same seed-potatoes
sprouting in the bags, “rubbed off” and
shooting again yielded less than a double
handful of berry-size tubers.
«y. de L.V.”: “Cockyson” (B.
23/5/’34) is right-about a better crop of
sweet potatoes coming when only one
joint of the cutting is covered by soil.
But h e does not mention two of the most
important factors for a successful crop,
deep trenching in between the rows
and nipping back the ends of the vines
to prevent them running beyond about
2ft. The result, in sandy soil, will be a
pleasant surprise,
“T.S.M.”: Next time “Bryan” (B.
23/5/’34) gets a chook with the staggers
from pumpkin-seeds let him shut the
bird in a coop and feed on maize alone,
I’ve seen many a fowl cured in this way.
“Granova”: To poison crows, nail a
ram’s horn to a post or tree. Fill all
except last 3in. of the horn with paper
stuffing, and fill the remaining space with
fat and about a teaspoonful of phos-
phorus. The same bait left on the ground
will tempt foxes. If you want the skin,
substitute as much ground strychnine as
will lie on a sixpence for the phosphorus.
“O. W. Waireki”: Use a stiff nail-
brush to paint powder dip on to sheep-
skins. Bore a small hole in the centre
of the brush-back and insert a wooden
handle 18in. long.
“Wrash”: Charcoal for the farm forge
being needed and a burning-kiln being
impracticable for small supplies, burn
half-green logs in the shelter of a gutter
or, better still, in a box-drain. Partly
quench the fire when it gets fierce, and
constantly rake away the glowing coals
to cool off. Use an old spade to push
the coals from the sides of the burning
logs. When cold, bag them.
“Drap”: As showing , the fertility of
the rich black soil of the Darling Downs,
one bushel of seed maize planted over
six acres returned the grower 283 bags.
Has this return been equalled in any
other district?
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
1 am requiring some trees to make a
breakwind (about 20 ft. high) at Gosford
( N.S.W. ), and have been recommended to try
bamboos. (1) Would they be suitable, and, if so,
names of suitable varieties and time to plant ?
(2) What is the best time to shift native trees ?
—1759.
(1) The giant bamboo ( Bambusa arundinaced)
forms dense clumps and would make a good
breakwind, but the price is rather high owing
to the difficulty of cutting out the growing
points.* Other tree species suitable for moist
soils are swamp mahogany (Eucalyptus robusta),
broad-leaved tea-tree (Melaleuca leucadendron)
and prickly-leaved tea-tree (Melaleuca sty-
phelioides). For positions near the sea front,
the M.L. Christmas-tree (Metrosideros tomen-
tosa) is suitable. (2) Small mature trees may
be shifted from now until August, but care is
necessary to take as much soil with the roots
as possible, as many of the species do not
stand transplanting well.
(1) Where could I obtain literature on the
Australian nut ("Macadamia ternifolia”) ? (2)
How to make loofah sponges ? —1652.
(1) The “N.S.W. Agricultural Gazette,” April,
1934, contains an article on “The Australian
Nut.” Obtainable Government Printer, Syd-
ney. Price 6d. (2) The fully developed fruits of
the dishcloth gourd ( Luffa acutanguld) are
placed in water for a week or so to hasten
rotting. They are then hung up to dry and
the seeds and rotted tissue other than fibre are
shaken out. In some countries the sponges
are bleached, but the method adopted is not
known locally.
How to eradicate crickets which are destroy-
ing seedlings ? —1430.
Use a poisoned bait. Paris green (loz.),
bran (Hlb.) and molasses (1 tablespoon) mix-
ture has given good results. Or try this well-
recommended overseas recipe: Twenty pounds
maizemeal is spread out and sprinkled with
about half a gallon of water. One pound zinc
phosphide is then dusted over it and the whole
thoroughly mixed. This should be scattered
over the infested ground while moist at sun-
set. The material should be handled and
stored with care, as it is poisonous, and must
be kept away from foods. The Paris green,
bran and molasses mixture is also poisonous.

SHADOW SHOWS
“Every Woman’s Man”
At the St. James. It is easily the most
interesting fight-talkie that has been
made. The plot is the one about the pug
who k.o.’s his way to the top of his pro-
fession, and then takes to chorus-girls
and whisky. The main difference is that
the hero, instead of being a narrow-
chested beauty-actor, is Max Baer,
aspirant to the heavyweight title. In
addition to looking like a pug, he makes
all the motions of an actor.
The picture emphasises two significant
points about the alleged art of the cinema.
One is that practically anybody can be
made to appear a finished mime on the
screen. It seems to be merely a matter
of patience on the part of the director
and intelligent cutting. Baer, who, when
this film was made, knew no more of
acting from personal experience than the
average Australian art-critic does of
painting, is indistinguishable in technique
from Clark Gable, Gary Cooper and a
dozen more great lovers. He runs
through the whole gamut of their busi-
ness with Myrna Loy and her rivals, and
doesn’t make one serious departure from
a formula which was imposed originally
by Valentino.
The other point is the necessity of over-
statement if a film is to go down with
film audiences, who, as regards mentality,
are identical with the melodrama audi-
ences of pre-film days. There is an
epileptic touch about the methods of some
of the performers which reminded the
writer of the naive extravagances of the
Sicilian players. Walter Huston repre-
sents the manager who is estranged by
Baer’s dissolute ways. Watching his
former protege from a ringside seat, the
perspiration streams from his face, his
eyes roll, his features are distorted, he
tears his collar off, tears his shirt open,
tears his coat off, gasps for air. Mean-
while many of those around him are
doing the same; fights start on all sides,
police pour in. It is strangely unlike what
happens at a real championship fight.
So is the fight. This 10-rounder between
Baer and Camera is waged at top
speed, without a let-up, from start to
finish ; and steam-hammer blows to the
jaw are landed by both men. Thrilling
as a spectacle, of course, but preposterous
to spectators who know anything about
boxing.
Jeffries acts as referee, and every living
champion and ex-champion now in the
U.S.A., with the exception of Jack John-
son, is introduced.
“This Side of Heaven”
A bourgeois domestic piece (U.S.A. for-
mula). Lionel Barrymore and Fay Bainter
have a family of stock Hollywood collegi-
ates and a stock Hollywood servant (need it
be said that the servant is Una Merkel?).
Barrymore gets into trouble at the office
and takes poison while his wife is away
on business in connection with an epoch-
making first novel which she has written
in her middle age. Meanwhile the son
gets smashed up in a car, and the girls’
love-affairs go wrong. The mother
returns, the expiring father is rushed to
an operating-room, the president of his
company calls to say it is all right about
the 40,000 dollars, the children fix up
their troubles. The defect of the picture
is that the experienced spectator knows
, exactly what is going to happen next at
every stage. The character-acting is
efficient as usual, and there isn’t an
episode that could bring a blush of shame
to the cheek even of a Customs Depart-
ment official.
“Bottoms Up”
A musical comedy, at the Plaza, with a
plot.
The action is laid in Hollywood,
where a go-getter (Spencer Tracy), an
English forger (Herbert Mundin) and a
retired jockey (Sid Silvers) are experienc-
ing a lean time. They are joined .by a
stranded beauty-prize winner (Pat Pater-
son), who worships afar a film star (John
Boles). Mundin, at the instigation of
Tracy, poses as an English peer, and Miss
Paterson as his daughter. They fool the
newspapers and some of the celebrities,
and by judicious forgery and blackmail-
ing, get a movie contract from Harry
Green. Tfie end shows the male sharpers
down and out again ; the lady has become
filmland’s newest star.
Miss Paterson is good ; likewise Boles,
who has a gift for comedy. Harry Green,
however, is the chief laugh-raiser, with
Mundin a close second.
“When New- York Sleeps”
Ostensibly this very long talkie at
Sydney Capitol is as moral as “Ten
Nights in a Bar-room.” But, though the
gambler-hero comes to a tragic end, he
steadfastly refuses to reform; he dies
“THE PRIVATE LIFE OF MENRY VIII.”
In centre: Charles Laughton as the much-married monarch. In margin :
Assortment of wives.
happy in the belief that he has not only
scored off a hated rival, but has won
back the wife he lost as the result of his
iniquities. Spencer Tracy makes the nar-
ration interesting throughout by present-
ing a nicely-shaded picture of the mind
and manners of an incorrigible play-boy.
His inconsistencies and sentimentalities,
one feels, are a natural part of the char-
acter. Helen Twelvetrees has a Griselda
part as the neglected wife.
“On Secret Service”
The action of this 8.1. spy-drama
takes place in Vienna and Rome, and to
give it verisimilitude most of the char-
acters have foreign accents—Carl Diehl
manages this part of it nicely; not so
the others. Carl, after about three-
quarters of an hour of the usual musi-
comedy spying and * flirtation, finds he
must choose between betraying Austria
and letting his lady-love (Greta Nissen)
drop to earth from his aeroplane. He
lets Greta drop, and goes on his cold,
ruthless way, pursued by a hail of pro-
jectiles from howitzers and machine-
guns, to unmask an Italian spy. Rub-
bish, of course ; but not so rubbishy as
most U.S.A. spy-melodramas.
“Emperor Jones”
This Melbourne Lyceum release is
dominated by the huge figure, majestic
bass and powerful acting of Paul Robe-
son, the negro tragedian. It has more
points of resemblance to O’Neil’s play
than is usual in screening confections.-
What it sets forth, in intensely dramatic
form, is the essential weakness of the
powerful. Jones is a nigger with the lust
for greatness of a Napoleon. His black
mammy has implanted in him the horror
of the unknown of his jungle ancestors,
and his native pastors have given it a
Christian complexion. Master of every
situation in which he only has to deal
with fellow-human beings, he becomes a
Pullman porter, rises to be personal ser-
vant of a railway president, murders an-
other nigger, finds himself in Sing Sing,
kills a white warder, escapes aboard a
steamer and lands, on a West Indian
island. Here he makes himself an em-
peror and creates a fantastic caricature
of a European court, supported by a
beachcombing white financier.
At the height of his glory his brutality
forces his subjects into revolt. He escapes
into the jungle, still confident of his
power to master all circumstances, but
the monotonous beating of the revolu-
tionary drums breaks down his. com-
posure. He becomes a fugitive from his
own conscience, and finally expires on
one of the voodoo altars of his fore-
fathers.
Only an actor of Robeson’s calibre
could have made this last scene anything
but ridiculous, but Robeson makes it
actually what the ballyhoo merchants

Musical Sydney got its first face-to-
face impression of Sir Hamilton Harty as
a conductor at the Town Hall on Satur-
day night. The visitor had no need to
be dissatisfied with the warmth of his
reception, the audience being almost as
dynamic as the orchestra in its expres-
sions of approval. Most of the music
played was new—either from scores not
heard before in Sydney (save over the
wireless from Melbourne recently) or,
as in the case of the Brahms No. 1 Sym-
phony and the Smetana overture, inter-
preted in a new manner. Undoubtedly
Sir Hamilton is a master of the
orchestra’s many and varied voices, and
that he was able after one week’s rehear-
sal to educe so successfully the effects
in which he excels says much for his
magnetic qualities—and also for the
teachability of the instrumentalists. In
the three or four weeks he has been in
Australia Sir Hamilton has opened the
ears of thousands to new realms of musi-
cal expression. The music he makes is
warmly . alive; always intelligent and
often witty. Pitching his pianissimo to
the merest whisper, this conductor has
a great range of light and shade to work
with, and he delights in the sharp con-
trasts that give vitality to so much
modern music. His treatment of Brahms
is illuminating, and he invests even such
trifles as Liadoffs “Musical Box” and
Rimsky-Korsakov’s “Bumble Bee” with
new significance and importance. The
audience on Saturday insisted on hearing
the Liadoff number twice, and appeared
to appreciate the delicacy of Delius’s
“Walk to Paradise Gardens” and the
contrapuntal graces of an excerpt from
Weinberger’s “Schwanda.” It may be
asking too much of the A.B.C. that it
should buy Harty outright and keep him
here, but it should certainly ask him to
call again.
* * *
The majestic Florence Austral and the
evergreen Amadio were welcomed back
by a huge audience at Melbourne Town
Hall on Saturday, and it was to be grate-
fully noted that the Australian singer did
not let her compatriots down, as visitors
do, in the matter of the quality of her pro-
gramme. Vocal proceedings opened with
a lovely group of Schubert songs in which
Madame excelled herself. Her voice has
that apparently effortless quality with
which art conceals art, and it was
nowhere more in evidence than in the
middle number of the Strauss songs
“Dream in the Twilight.” Operatic items
were “Amuri Amuri” of Geni Sadero and
an aria from Verdi’s “La Forza del
Destino.” Here the depth and the
breadth of the lady’s soprano were com-
bined with great vigor of attack. It has
been heard to more tremendous effect in
Brunnhijde’s somewhat hackneyed battle
bellow, but it is rumored that a ’flu
germ was lurking in the vicinity of the
singer with intent to filch a top note.
In her modern numbers, by Leighter,
Bantock and Harty, the singer was
equally impressive. Amadio obliged with
a Bach sonata and the finale from the
flute concerto in D of Mozart. He has
the faculty of making his thin instrument
sound like an orchestra. Raymond
Lambert played the Beethoven sonata
in F sharp minor, not in his best
manner, but he mastered the emotional
content of the Allegro de Concert of
Granados and proved a smooth accom-
panist.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Several Grand National candidates
figured in the Ballater Hurdle field at
Moonee Valley, but the result had no
important bearing on the big event. The
Adelaide horse Great Chester was
backed down to 2 to 1. He cleared out
from the opposition, and, jumping with
fine dash, established a commanding lead,
but tired. Full Charge, who had been
almost last at the half-way stage, finished
very strongly, but failed by half a head
to catch Dress Suit. Two lengths behind
this pair came Great Chester. When
lying second, The Mirror struck a hurdle
near the five-furlong post and dropped
out of the hunt. He is in the stable of
A. D. Webster, who recently suffered a
misfortune —Bayacre was killed while
schooling.
Novice jumpers develop rapidly, and
it may be unwise to dismiss the Ballater
Hurdle performers from G.N. calcula-
tions. They are all lightly weighted at
■ Flemington, Great Chester having 9st.
71b. (a stone less than he carried on
Saturday), Dress Suit and Full Charge
9st. 21b., The Mirror and Manlius 9st.
Manlius, who belongs to “S. A. Raw-
don,” ran fourth, but was ten lengths
behind the nearest placegetter. Dress
Suit was sired by Stand By ; his dam.

Brevadale, is by Berridale (son of Wal-
lace) from Breva, by Grafton from
Mistral, by Havoc from Aura. There is
even more fashionable blood in the pedi-
gree of Full Charge. He was sired by
Heroic’s brother Thracian, and is out of
Lancet, by Spearhead from Alexandra
(imp.), who produced Kingsburgh.
The Boiardo Steeplechase was another
washout from a G.N. standpoint. Har-
monic, who led practically all the way
and won easily from the favorite, Calfly,
is not engaged in the cross-country event
at headquarters; neither is Calfly nor
the third horse, King of Arms. The G.N.
aspirants to sport silk were Tongalla,
Daily Mail, Prince Flaviol and Grave-
lines. None was placed ; Tongalla and
Daily Mail fell. It is unlikely that Hoy-
sted will send Tongalla to the post for
the National, which he hopes to win
again with Redditch. The dashing
manner in which Dummett rode Har-
monic compelled admiration. Dummett
had employed similar tactics with Great
Chester in the hurdle race, but his mount
knocked up.
Those associated with him did not
believe that the Warroona Handicap could
be taken away from Kaoota, who had
finished an impressive second to Belle
Marie on the same course a fortnight
before. The Cyklon gelding went out
favorite. He began badly, never
stretched out in earnest and beat only
two of his 11 rivals. Winner turned up
in Kalili, who outgalloped Jack Sing’s
representative, Court Crier, over the
short straight and scored by three-
quarters of a length, with Casque d’Or
a good third. It may not be long before
Bold Bid pulls a race out for Tindall.
He led for part of the journey.
George Harrison, who the top
flight of Melbourne flatrace jockeys
before he took out a trainer’s license, has
a very useful four-year-old in the Magpie
gelding April the First. So far April the
First has not flown at high game, but
he keeps winning. Backed from 5 to 1
down to half those odds for the Com-
pensation Handicap, he proved the best
of good things.
* * * *
Racing at Randwick on the last day of
the winter meeting was remarkable for
reversals of form. Naturally they assisted
the bookmakers, who lost on only one of
the seven races. At this time of year, of
course, wet tracks are to be reckoned
with, and sometimes reputed mudlarks will
fail where they are expected to shine.
Still, the stewards might hold an inquiry
or two occasionally. The attendance was
22,000, an increase of 6000 on the corre-
sponding day of last year.
Windbird, by the defunct Magpie, was
backed to sevens in the Botany Handicap,
the lightly-framed Mafoota going out
favorite. Acting up to stable expecta-
tions, Windbird, ridden nicely by O’Sulli-
van, finished too solidly for the out-
sider Bill Wedgewood and Mafoota;
Veilantif, the pacemaker, was a close
fourth. Persian was always in the pic-
ture, and is worth keeping in mind, but
Blixten and Turbine, who opened
favorite, shaped poorly.
Watson, a stable-mate of Windbird,
trained by Peter Riddle for Bob Byers,
started at 3 to 1 for the Second Nur-
sery, First Son being the elect of
backers at 5 to 2 ; and again followers of
Riddle’s string collected. But the brother
to Confab had to be punched right out to
beat the pacemaker, Limyris, Heritor
being an excellent third and First Son
fourth. The last-named finished bril-
liantly, and he looks a Derby proposi-
tion for owner Dick Wootton and trainer
P. Nolan. Paragon also showed speed.
Journal was responsible for one of the
reversals of form. In winning the Winter
Plate (at 14 to 1) he proved himself a
stayer who will be kept in mind for the
long races in the spring. The son of
Treclare and Encre finished gamely to
overhaul Mr. Kerry in the last furlong ;
Balgay was third. Forestry was made
favorite, but had had enough half a mile
from home. Bold Boy was always in
the picture, and a win for him while the
high-class stayers are spelling is very
probable. 4
Newcastle-owned and -trained Speldon
(10 to 1), carrying the Donald colors, did
not leave the result of the Exeter Handi-
cap in doubt when he dashed away at
the Leger. Kept going by Stan Davidson,
he had too much toe for Archmel and
Cool Spell. Jamieson and his friends
supported Upoko Ariki. The chestnut
could not go a yard in the early stages,
but ran on well in the straight. Love
Song finished fourth just ahead of Tor-
toni; Zeus was the pacemaker for a
long way.
Both divisions of the Novice gave the
bookies a clean sheet. In the first, the
14.2 pony Presumptuous (12 to 1), by Beon
from the Dominion mare Small Talk,
outstayed Cid and Molvius; in the
second, Silvius King (20 to 1) defeated
Depar and Diamond.

Australian racing lost a great sire when
Magpie had to be destroyed at Kia-Ora
stud, near Scone. By Dark Ronald
Popinjay, he was imported as a three-
year-old by Robinson and Clark. In
England he had done little racing,
his best showing being second in
the Two Thousand Guineas to Gay
Crusader in 1917. In Australia he ran
in seven races as a four- and five-year-
old, winning three, including the V.R.C.
Linlithgow Stakes, in which he downed
Desert Gold and Cetinge. As a sire he
was an amazing success, and up to
March last his 840 winners had taken
£269,000 in prize-money. Windbag was,
perhaps, his greatest son.
* * * *
The Bulletin's selection for the
Derby, Windsor Lad, duly rolled home at
Epsom last week at the very nice price of
15 to 2 in 2min. 34sec. for the mile 4
furlongs 29 yards. He was third favorite,
and, as the second colt, Easton, was
placed just after the favorite, Colombo,
on the betting lists, the race result was
an inversion of the betting order.
Colombo started at 11 to 8. He found
the climb to Tattenham corner too much
for him. There had been criticism of
“Togo” Johnstone’s jockeyship before
the race, and it was briskly renewed
afterwards. Windsor Lad won by a
length, and a neck separated second and
third. He is owned by the Maharajah of
Rajpipla.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Opposed to Penchiff at Leichhardt,
Tommy Nylan showed that he can hold
his own with most of the importations.
With a full-Nelson he made the Bulgarian
concede a fall in the fourth round.
The next was all buffoonery, except
that Penchiff floored the Aussie with a
right swing that any pug would be proud
of. In the sixth Penchiff was awarded
a fall, though ringsiders swore that only
one shoulder had touched the mat. One
more draw.
Woodfull’s Men
At the close of the second day’s play
at Trent Bridge, it looked as if Australia
would go pretty close to putting the first
Test in her bag. After patchy cricket on
the first day, when it took from 11.30
until 6.15 to get together 207 runs for 5
wickets, stumps being drawn owing to
failing light, a grim resistance by
McCabe, Chipperfield, Oldfield and
Grimmett took the total to 374. At
stumps that evening England had lost 4
good wickets for 128 and the pitch was
beginning to wear.
The opening Australian batting was
not inspiring, and it says much for the
tolerance oi the Notts crowd that they
forbore to comment on Woodfull’s
26 in two hours or an equally wearisome
22 from Brown, who was sent in first
wicket down. Ponsford compensated
with a finely-played 53, and Bradman
did not linger during a lively shot for
29. As Darling had gone for 4, it was
fortunate McCabe found his form and
a reliable partner in Chipperfield. Mc-
Cabe was the first to go for an attrac-
tive but careful 63. Chipperfield carried
on, and the aspect of the game changed
when Oldfield gave solid support with 20
and Grimmett came along with a bats-
man’s innings of 39. Chipperfield reached
99 at the lunch interval, and was caught
by Ames off the third ball after resuming
—cruel luck to get so near the three
figures in his first Test. His batting was
not as carefree as usual, but went far
to save the day for his side.
Of the English bowlers, the fast Essex
amateur Fames made a great debut with
5 for 102, his victims being Woodfull,
Ponsford, McCabe, Chipperfield—all
caught —and O’Reilly, who was bowled.
The veteran Geary kept a fine length
to take 3 for 101, Bradman, Brown and
Grimmett being his bag. Mitchell and
Verity each took a costly wicket.
England opened with skipper Walters
—replacing the injured Wyatt —and Sut-
cliffe. They had 45 up when Walters
went to one of Grimmett’s straight breaks
for 17, after Chipperfield had missed
him. in the slips. Hammond replaced
him, and the score jogged along to 102,
when Sutcliffe snicked Grimmett to Chip-
perfield, who this time made no mis-
take, and departed for a sound 62. More
trouble followed when Hammond mishit
O’Reilly and was caught by McCabe
when he had made 25. Leyland joined
Pataudi, and the Yorkshireman’s backers
tore their tickets up when he popped
a lollypop back to Grimmett. The latter
had now taken 3 for 43, and had the best
of them scratching. O’Reilly bowled far
better than his figures of 1 for 41 sug-
gest. Pataudi (6 n. 0.) and Hendren (10
n. 0.) played safety till stumps.

Thirty-five thousand League followers
at South Melbourne’s ground on Satur-
day who hoped for a mighty struggle
with Richmond flopped badly. Rich-
mond, fast and clever, put it all over
the Red-and-Whites, and at lemon-time
had a 10-goal lead. Souths were with-
out Diggins, Reville and Beard, but that
shouldn't have made the difference. Re-
cent setbacks have taught the Tigers a
lesson, and their machine was sparking
in all plugs ; result, Richmond 108 South
64. Another game that promised thrills
—Collingwood v. Fitzroy • provided
plenty. Going off at a great bat Fitz-
roy put on a sound lead. But the Mag-
pies steadied, settled down, and by halt-
time were within 13 points. After that
it was a hard go, with little lost and no-
thing given away. Finally the locals goi
home with 111 to ’Roy’s 96. It was a
great game, with Carter, Beveridge, Pan-
nam and H. Collier shining on one side
and Bunton, Sexton and Cordner on the
other. Geelong’s lads came up to Essen-
don, and, as they often do, forgot to bring
their form with them. The team that
drew with ’Wood the Monday before
could score only 82 points to Don s 95.
St. Kilda visited Melbourne, and by
greater pace and accuracy held the Red
Legs easily, winning by 134 to 101. The
Saints are being coached by their old
champion Colin Watson, and recent vic-
tories have put them in the first four.
Carlton outed North Melbourne with
145 to 83, and Hawthorn broke its duck,
so to speak, by downing Footscray, 77-71.

Rugby Union club competitions in
Sydney once more showed how closely
matched the teams are, seven of the nine
being possible candidates for the premier-
ship. In a dour match at North Sydney
Northern Suburbs administered a check
to the flying Rand wick team, scores at
the end being 12-12. Western Suburbs
downed Manly 6-3, the scores being all
penalty goals. University was too good
for Drummoyne, winning 6-10, and St.
George defeated the long-suffering East-
ern Suburbs by 18-8. University now
heads the table a point in front of Rand-
wick.
* * * *
In the Sydney League matches, West-
ern Suburbs continued its march to the
premiership over the body of St. George,
which went down 24-15. Mead’s 6 goals
had much to do with the Western win.
South Sydney had no trouble in outing
Newtown by 19-9, scoring five tries to
one. University, after a good first half
against Eastern Suburbs, collapsed in
the second, to go down by 40 to 11.
North Sydney fought a tough battle with
Balmain at Leichhardt, but took the
knock by 17 to 12. An unusual item was
a penalty try awarded Frankland, of Bal-
main.

and here’s what "Knees”
mean to motoring comfort
Drive a Master Chevrolet over a bumpy road there are no jolts that
bounce you on your seat, no suggestion of insecurity of steering, and no
front to rear pitching of the car. Instead, there is an easy glide with all
the shocks smoothed out before they reach the chassis, by the new Knee-
action front wheels. Three years of perfecting on the proving ground
guarantees the effectiveness of Chevrolet’s Knee-action wheels.
Each front wheel has a resilient coil spring of its own which is of the
correct resiliency to absorb all road shocks. The wheel rises and falls like
the action of a human knee, adapting itself to every road variation, while
the car glides on without any jarring, pitching or loss of equilibrium.
Another outstanding feature of the Master Chevrolet is its improved
engine which now develops 80 horsepower to give 80 miles an hour, while
using even less petrol than before.
Space does not allow for the full listing of the many improvements.

Woodfull’s Men
The match with Lancashire resolved
itself into a bit of batting practice by the
visitors. Australia carried the overnight
score to 367 on the second day, Barnett
being 61 n.o. Lancashire got to 285, Ernest
Tyldesley hitting up 107. The bright spot
in our bowling was 5 for 107 by Fleet-
wood-Smith. The second Australian try
saw 3 down for 338 when stumps and
the match were drawn. Bill Woodfull
delighted all except the spectators with
172 n. 0., and Brown contributed 119.
Neither innings was inspiring and t’
operatives behind the fence didn’t
forget to mention the fact. Baxter, who
had proved so dangerous in the first
innings, could not turn out in the second,
and the rest of the Lancashire bowling
was far from champion.
* * * *
“Will Scarlet”: It is pleasant to note
the atmosphere of anxious courtesy which
has surrounded our cricketers since their
arrival in England. There have been
only two jarring notes. One was a
demonstration at Lord’s, where one
expects that sort of thing, and the other
the refusal of the Mayor of Nottingham
to silence the chimes of the town hall
clock, “Little John,” during the night
so that the Australians in their hotel
over the way might get some sleep. How-
ever, the clock itself has taken the matter
up and set its Mayor a tactful example
by suddenly refusing to strike at all.
This is the first time it has happened
since the days of Robin Hood, and must
be acknowledged as a graceful gesture.
* * * *
“Yarker”: By some accounts England
is on the verge of revolution owing to
many thousands being unable to get tickets
for the Test matches. London papers
are complaining of the “antiquated and
cramped” grounds at Trent Bridge,
Lord’s, Leeds, Manchester and the Oval,
and compare them unfavorably with the
“stately Sydney and Melbourne grounds.”
Even these places are very far from suit-
ing the requirements of the public which
follows big cricket and football, and in
both extensive alterations and additions
to accommodation are being undertaken.
Something of the sort will have to be
done in England, for the biggest arenas
there, Lord’s and Old Trafford, can barely
squeeze in 30,000.

Victoria and South Australia clash
under Australian Rules on Saturday at
Adelaide, the while the V.F.A. and V.F.L.
are opposing each other in Melbourne.
The Victorians have sent a strong side,
skippered by the evergreen Syd Coventry,
which includes several players formerly
located in South Australia who have been
induced in one way and another to take
on Cabbage Garden nationality. This
is rather rubbing it in. It may be excus-
able to attract talent from one State by
offers of badly-needed employment and
so on, but to utilise it to bite the hand
that fed it, in a manner of speaking, is
surely over the odds.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: Since the V.F.L. and its
disrespected parent the Association
agreed to bury the hatchet a season or so
back, there have been several escapes
from the tomb, so to speak. Another
amnesty conference was held recently,
and it was decided that all disqualifica-
tions, save for field offences, should be
lifted by both bodies. Further, there is
to be a challenge match between League
and Association sides at Melbourne
Cricket Ground, the gate to go to charity.

Rugby Union players held an Aus-
tralian field day on King’s Birthday. In
Brisbane, after narrowly losing the first
match, Queensland flattened N.S.W.
21-12. In Sydney Victoria beat an alleged
“N.S.W.” side 14-6. Melbourne saw South
Aus. figure against a home team for the
first time in the story of Rugby Union in
Australia, the visitors going down 26-16
after giving a creditable exhibition. In
Tasmania Melbourne Uni. won a hard
match from Southern Tasmania, 12-8.
If any further arguments are needed in
favor of the formation of an Australian
Rugby Union to take the control of the
game out of the hands of individual
States they may be found in the fore-
going.
* * * *
Queensland Rugby League players
ended their Sydney visit with a match
under electric light at Sydney Show-
ground against a N.S.W. side. They
most unexpectedly won by 14 to 10,
scoring two tries, both converted, and
two penalty goals to two tries, one con-
verted, and a p.g. The attendance was
disappointing and the experiment was
probably a costly one. Following on the
failure of the series of club matches
under artificial light at the end of last
winter, it is evident Sydney is of opinion
that “East, west, hame’s best” when it
comes to night football.

The Nineteenth Hole
“Red Fern”: A ball which broke at
right angles after being putted a few feet
cost lan Grant several strokes in the
open golf championship at Brisbane. On
the ninth green the ball’s queer behavior
so mystified him that he examined it and
found a piece of bone as white as the
ball protruding from it. The bone had,
apparently, been picked up by the ball
on landing on the fairway after a drive.

“Amateur Pro.”: Wallace, the artisan
from Troon who played magnificent golf
in the recent British amateur champion-
ship, only to be beaten in a hectic final
by Lawson Little, has joined the Selsdon
Park staff. Whether his ability as a
player will help him in the coaching
which is a club pro.’s chief job, remains
to be seen.
* * * *
“Hoylake”: The British open golf
championship, which opens at Sandwich
on June 25, has only seven American
entries this year—evidence, maybe, of the
depresh from which Uncle Sam is trying
to extricate himself. The seven are:
Densmore Shute (title-holder), Genb
Sarazen, Macdonald Smith, Kirkwood,
Melhorn, Lawson Little and Moreland.
Interesting to Australians are the entries
of Sarazen and Kirkwood. The pair are
due in Australia very shortly after the
finish of the open, and they will have to
gallop.
* * * *
“Sandringham”: Melbourne golfers
are mildly agitated over certain heresies
put forward by one Martin Smith, a
well-known professional player in the
Cabbage Garden. Martin throws to the
winds the teachings of the Fathers. He
says that in putting the player should
not keep both eyes on the ball, but the
right on the clubhead and the other on
the pill. While I am in accord with
Martin in his defiance of steretoyped
golfing conventions, I cannot follow him
in the matter of this kind of two-eyed
stance. Of all the animates I have come
in contact with, about the only one I
can recall as likely to be able to carry
it out is the chameleon. As a flycatcher,
that swivel-eyed beast is superb. As a
golfer, I should hesitate to back him to
beat a member of the British Walker
Cup team.

“Divot Digger”: The Kirk-Windeyer
Cup authorities in N.S.W. are wondering
if “there is visions about.” The other
day they got a request from the Vic-
torian G.A. that the next contest for
the pot be played during the Cabbage
Garden State championships in order to
add lustre to the centenary celebrations.
The Kirk-Windeyer business is, tem-
porarily at least, dead and buried, chiefly
because of the studied aloofness from the
meetings of the other golfing States, par-
ticularly Victoria. There is no report
yet of a reply from Ma. Probably the
heads are in convocation hunting for just
the right word or combination of words.

“Woodlands”: Victorian returned-
soldier golfers mean to make a big splash
with their centenary tournament on
November 9, it being hoped that the
Prince will attend the subsequent dinner.
Royal Melbourne will be the venue, and,
as 1000 or more entries are expected,
both the courses will be used for an 18-
hole competition. All active-service men
serving with any belligerent nation dur-
ing the war may enter, provided they are
members of recognised golf clubs. This
will let in players from visiting warships
and other birds-of-passage. Trophies by
the ton are promised.
Racquet and Bawl
Australia progressed a step in the Davis

in the first two singles and the doubles.
In the singles Crawford beat Fukijura
6-3, 6-3, 11-9, while McGrath accounted
for Yamagishi 2-6, 7-5, 6-2, 6-4. Craw-
ford and Quist were our doubles pair,
and they won from Yamagishi and Nishi-
mura 6-1, 6-0, 4-6, 9-7. An excellent
start.
* * * *
“Top Spin”: Having obliterated
Mexico and thus won that soft snap the
American zone, the Yankee Davis Cup
chiefs have chosen the team which is to
visit Yurrup and tackle the winners of
the tourney on that side. The five picked
were Stoeffen, Shields, Wood, Lott and
Van Ryn. Van Ryn has dropped out.
Allison is on the injured list and out
of the question, and, as Van Ryn was to
replace him in the doubles with Lott, his
absence may prove serious. The side
sailed for England on Saturday, and will
make its bow in the Queen’s Club
tournament.
* * * *
“Hotham”: The people running the
special international tennis tourney in
Melbourne at the end of the year are
feeling a bit more cheerful, the tendency
of leading players overseas to cast a
glassy eye on invitations showing signs of
vanishing. Two South Africans have
accepted, and Perry says he and Hughes
will make the trip. With them will
probably come Peggy Scriven, Dorothy
Round and Betty Nuthall, so there
will be something for our girls to
get their claws into. The Italian De
Stefani is also asking for particulars. He
“ Nonsense, boy—the ball can’t have gone both ways!”
would be a big hit here, for he is a freak
player like McGrath, save that he plays
with right or left hand alike, never em-
ploying a backhand.
* t- * *
“Cash Amateur”: The International
L.T. Federation is submitting questions
pn the amateur status to the various
national associations. The three points
stressed are the facts that leading players
are becoming professionals, that many
others are obviously playing under con-
ditions which point to secret profession-
alism, and that the employment of
players by traders in tennis goods, with
the natural result that they are supposed
to push the products of their firms, is not
in the best interests of the game. The
federation suggests the appointment of
a special committee in each association
to investigate the status of players, with
power to deal drastically with breaches
of the amateur code. The trouble is that
“drastic treatment of breaches’ would
eliminate every first-class or near first-
class player from the amateur side ot tne
game pretty well everywhere.
Car and Cycle
“Whizz”: The hardy inhabitants of
Phillip Island (Vic.) were again invaded
the other day by motor-racing addicts,
the occasion being the “Winter ’ 100-
mile race. There were 15 starters, and
eight finished. The winner was L.
Jennings, driving an M.G. Magna, who
hit up 74.2 m.p.h.—he had a start of
lOmin. 45sec. Lea Wright, winner of
the Australian G.P. this year, was second
with an average speed of 67.9 m.p.h.
Breakdowns were plentiful but there
were no accidents, the dust nuisance
being conspicuous by its absence.
* * * *
“Differential” : America’s only motor-
car race of importance, the Indiana-
polis 500, was won this year by William
Cummings, who has had several shies at
it. He did the distance in 4hr. 46min.
a record for the race. The field
had to be kept down to 33 starters,
and only a small number of these lasted
out the run, which was watched by 135,000
people. Cummings’s car was not given
in the cable. On a previous occasion he
drove a Diesel-engined job.
“Fitzcray”: The Melbourne centenary
heads have gone back to their old idea
of a motor-car race, round Albert Park
reserve, which is mostly inhabited by
golfers and ducks, the latter on the lake.
The race is to be 250 miles ; the park is
a bit over six miles round. There is no
track, and a fence will be necessary to
protect the public on November 7, if
serious risks are not to be run. As it is,
the show will be limited to cars not over
2500 c.c. capacity.
tj: * * *
“Kick Starter”: Queensland’s revived
motor-cycle Grand Prix, a 100-mile go
over the Kingston circuit, was won by
L. Sherrin, riding a 3|-h.p. Rudge, in lhr.
34min. bsec. M. R. Anderson, who won
the Australian G.P. at Bathurst a couple
of months ago, was 47sec. back, second.
Several N.S.W. cracks, including Don
Bain, started, but failed to show up at the
finish. There is no racing to which the
old adage of horses for courses applies
more particularly than road-cycling and
motor-cycling, and the Queenslanders
seem to have made the most of their local
knowledge.
* * * *
“Sprocket”: Ossie Nicholson, disquali-
fied by a Victorian official recently for
three months for riding without permis-
sion alongside another cyclist who
was attempting an Adelaide-Melbourne
record (B. 16/5/’34), appealed to the
Australian heads. These staggered the
distance rider by increasing the sentence
to six moons. The tough part of it is
that Nicholson, a professional, will be
debarred from taking part in the rich
round-Victoria centenary race, in which
he, as the unchallenged long-distance
champion of Australia, would have been
certain of making a good killing.
Miscellaneous
“Chevroford”: The last-minute rush at
the Melbourne end to enter the cen-
tenary air contest resulted in 43 nomina-
tions —10 American, nine British, eight
Australian, four Dutch, four French,
three Maoriland, two Italian, one Irish
Free State, one Danish and one Swedish.
More were due to come from London.
Some of the biggest aces are repre-
sented. Weddell (U.S.A.) is holder of the
world’s land ’plane speed record of 305
m.p.h. ; Parer was one of the pioneers of
the England-Australia flight; Smirnoff
made the journey Amsterdam to Batavia
and back in a total of eight days nine
hours and 13 minutes; and Mrs. Louise
Thaden (U.S.A.) holds the world’s
women’s endurance record of 196 hours
five minutes. The one-eyed Post, regarded
as Uncle’s premier flier, lately talked of
doing the trip at 300 m.p.h. and at a
height of 30,000 feet. If he can justify
his boast, it will be all over bar shout-
ing 48 hours after the gun goes off.
* * * *
“The Gaffer”: The Australian Empire
Games sprinters have some reason to
bless the South Africans for dropping the
flying Joubert from their team. Just
after Thenuissen was preferred to him,
Dan reeled off 100 yards in 9 2-5 sec.
This is not only a Union record but
equals the world’s best put up in 1930 by
Yankee Frank Wyckoff. Australian Jim
Carlton has also notched the figures, but
in his case an “assisting wind” kept them
off the record books.
* Jfc SH #
“Third Base”: There was a teacup
cyclone in Sydney baseball last week when
the Umpires’ Association struck for higher
pay on the eve of the inter-State
matches with Victoria. The baseball
heads promptly suspended the lot and
filled their places. The reply of the umps.
to that was to resign in a body —a rather
superfluous gesture, one would think.
* * *
“Shinty”: The Australian hockey
people have everything set for the Aus-
tralian tour of Maoriland, and are only
waiting for the nominations to come in
by June 15. The team will be picked on
July 7. The side, with W. Rothwell as
manager, leaves Sydney on August 17,
and will play its first match at Wellington
against Dannevirke club on August 23.
* * * *
“Aileron”: One of the hurdles for
competitors in the coming centenary air
race is the fixing up of the passport
bother. Vacuum Oil has been busy for
some time on the job, but still has one
or two recalcitrant countries to win over.
However, the Netherlands Indies have
made a sporting gesture in deciding to
waive all formalities usually in force as
to landings and departures. They have
also started on new equipment for night
landings at Batavia and Sourabaya, while
the wireless stations will broadcast
weather reports. During the race, Dutch
vessels will patrol the sea areas of the
course within the N.I. jurisdiction.

a man can’t “ply” horses unless he does it

doubts about its originality, so out it went....
M.B.: You have a lot to unlearn and much
to learn... .L.P.B.: The wash drawing shows
merit, but there is not sufficient contrast in
the tones.
THE PALETTE
An exhibition of pictures made by
Australian painters in the late ’eighties
and early ’nineties occupies the walls of
the Macquarie Galleries, Sydney. It is
a reminder that there isn’t much new
under the sun. Streeton is represented by
‘The Football Match” in his early im-
pressionistic style, which is rather broader
and certainly more interesting than most
of the current essays in the fuzzy manner.
Lambert’s water-color sketch of “She-
oak Sam” looks as fresh as if it were
painted yesterday; there has been no
improvement since on the Lambert
draughtsmanship and color economy. A.
H. Fullwood’s large canvas showing
George-street in a winter’s dusk, with the
Post Office clock on that frontage alight
and hansom cabs dashing hither and
thither, is another striking piece of im-
pressionism. Charles Conder in “The
Day We Lost Poor Flossie” out-
Meldrums the Meldrumites ; his excuse
was that he was actually painting a fog.
Tom Roberts’s portraits of lassies in
sailor hats and veils and leg-o’-mutton
sleeves don’t look as weird as they would
have looked ten years ago—the fashions
are veering back to the ’nineties. John
Longstaff’s portrait of Julian Ashton is a
reminder that neither knight John nor
his younger brothers-of-the-brush have
added anything to the art of limning a
face in the intervening 40 years.
Grace Scott-Ross has on show at the
Grosvenor Galleries, Sydney, a collec-
tion of 40 oils, mostly flower-pieces, with
a scattering of landscapes. All are bright
and cheerful, but many of the pictures
are marred by poor drawing and careless
painting. Best floral study in the show
is “Oleanders,” and “The Little Jug,”
“Banksia” and “The Copper Pot” are
also well-considered essays in color.
“Devonshire Farm” is the most pleasing
of the landscapes.
Arthur Streeton’s exhibition at Mel-
bourne Athenaeum is dedicated to the
memory of John Monash. It contains
one of Streeton’s largest pictures, “The
Vanishing Forest,” which is also one of
his latest, and is priced at 800 guineas.
The painter’s new manner is not as good
as his old or middle manner, exemplified
by such canvases as “Grey Day on the
Hawkesbury River,” painted in 1896,
lent for the current show. The later
Streeton is fussy and preoccupied with
unimportant details. He can paint a
sky and a distant range of mountains
and an immense middle distance with
more or less breadth, but at the same
time can affect to see the fronds of a
fern in the foreground. There is a slick-
ness about the execution ; the viewpoint
is pedestrian. There is nothing in these
pictures that the man in the street couldn’t
instantly appreciate.
Amidst a large and cosmopolitan array
of etchings, pencil drawings and wood-
cuts by such masters as Anders Zorn,
Brangwyn, Strang, Norman Lindsay and
Penleigh Boyd, exhibited at Melbourne,
the eye of this critic lingered longest on
a study of half a dozen women hoeing by
Doreen Goodchild. It had a freshness,
simplicity and directness which were
absent from some of its more pretentious
rivals. Mrs. Goodchild is the wife of
John C. Goodchild, the South Australian
etcher, and a good man, too ; but there
was nothing in his panel of 40 examples
which struck this commentator so forcibly
as the impression of the hoeing ladies.
The picture market is looking up. A
Sydney Harbor scene by A. J. Burgess
recently sold in London for over 1000
guineas, and a Maori portrait by Charles
Goldie for 250. At an auction in Mel-
bourne lately a bronze by Web Gilbert
went for 100 guineas, a Hans Heysen
landscape for 110 and Streeton’s ‘Grey
Day on the Hawkesbury,” from the late
Dr. Springthorpe’s collection, for 250.
This is pretty well back to pre-depres-
sion prices.
Miss Annie Gates and Miss M. Hol-
gate, whose show is at Melb. Athenaeum,
have the refreshing merit of never taking
the unwary visitor by surprise. If they
make progress year by year, it is gradual
enough not to appear like a sudden
jump. Miss Holgate’s landscapes are
bright and sunny, but they have the pecu-
liar quality of not suggesting Australian
landscape at all, although the titles dis-
tinctly say they are. “Dromana” and “A
Smoky Day” are possible exceptions to
the above. They have the unusual
quality of unity. Miss Gates hangs 40
or 50 demonstrations of a sincere, if un-
critical, affection for flowers, of which
No. 73, “Anemone,” bespeaks a second
look.
“F.S.”: Melbourne Centenary Com-
mittee finds itself in another quandary.
It wanted a medallion or plaque bear-
ing some memorial design symbolic of
the city’s first hundred years. A com-
petition yielded bad results, symbols
being ornate, crowded and confused ; so
they commissioned Rayner Hoff. The
Sydney sculptor submitted a design com-
posed of one wheatear, representing the
wheat industry, and one ram’s head (skele-
ton), representing wool; on the obverse is
an electrical transmission tower. The
design has been criticised on grounds of
too great austerity, but the Centenary
Council has adopted it.

TWO-WAY, DOUBLE ACTION
TYRE INFLATION
The “RENRUT” QUADRUPLE TYRE PUMP gives a
remarkable service in tyre inflation. Built on the principle
of quadruple compression, which provides a double-acting
main barrel, drawing in air on both the up and down strokes,
this unique mechanism doubles the capacity of the large barrel,
and so halves the time of inflation. The inner high-pressure
cylinder ensures easy delivery of this large volume.
Sturdily built for a long life of faithful service, the “RENRUT”
QUADRUPLE offers quicker and easier pumping than you
have ever known.

World Trade and Australia
For the 12 months to February last,
world export values were fairly steady,
but January and February estimates were
slightly less than in the same months of
the previous year.
The quantity of goods passing between
countries has not dropped in anything
like the same ratio as their value. The
volume of trade in 1933 was not greatly
below that for 1932 ; but values slumped
heavily. Though volume at the end of
1933 was around 75 p.c. of 1929 activity,
value was about 35 p.c. Again, taking
1929 as 100, the world price index was
about 50 during 1933.
The efforts to combat this fall in prices
are shown by the effect of currency depre-
ciation and the premium on gold. At
the end of March U.K., U.S.A., Can-
adian, S’African and Indian currencies
showed a depreciation of approximately
40 p.c. compared with their old gold
parity. The dollar, keeping to a premedi-
tated plan, was slightly weaker than the
others. Australian and M.L. notes were
worth less than half of their former gold
values, but were not so far down the list
as Spain and Greece.
The index of industrial production,
taking 1928 as 100, was very uneven at
Dec. 31 last. Germany’s was 74.5, Bel-
gium’s 70.6, Canada’s 72.2, France’s 83.5,
U.S.A.’s 67.6, Japan’s 138.1 and Great
Britain’s 98.6. Among the more important
countries, Japanese and British trade was
the healthiest. Britain’s unemployment
position was better than at any time since
1930; the figures for last January and
February were 3 p.c. better than in 1933.
Though Britain’s and Australia’s re-
coveries are very heartening, they are not
world-wide characteristics. We cannot
ignore the troubles of other countries.
They are our markets, and their buying
power is reflected in world prices, upon
which our sheep-farmers and wheat-
growers depend so much.
Wool and’ Prosperity
“Murrawong”: When the bottom
dropped out of the wool market a few
years ago, it took nearly a year for the
repercussion to be felt among Australian
secondary industries. But when wool
rose to a payable level last season the
recovery in other business was apparent
immediately ; and politicians whooped
that we were round the corner, and voted
themselves an extra £75 a year.
Recently Germany imposed a ban on
wool imports, and the buying at the Lon-
don sales at once slowed up. The result
was also evident in our own markets.
Then France and Belgium, racked by in-
ternal troubles, cut down their purchases,
while Japan eased off. Buyers sat on
the fence awaiting the next move. While
optimists were saying that Germany must
have wool there was a further extension
of the ban, and the gravity of the situa-
tion was no longer in doubt.
Last week at the Melbourne wool
sales there was a definite dwindling in
demand and consequent drop in values.
Sydney and Brisbane, with over 100,000
bales for sale within the month, were
faced with the prospect of a substantial
drop in prices and heavy withdrawals.
Sydney catalogues were relatively unim-
portant—merely a clearing-up sale at the
end of the season —but Brisbane had
90,000 bales, chiefly autumn-shorn clips,
representing about £2,000,000 at the
season’s average value.
At a hurriedly-convened conference
on the eve of the Sydney sales, it was
decided to postpone all auctions until
July, when the position will be again
reviewed.
This is the* first important postpone-
ment of sales in nine years, but all parties
are agreed that it is the only action
possible.
Sugar and Wages
The Queensland sugar industry was
before the Industrial Court in Brisbane
last week. The A.W.U. is asking for
restoration of 1932 wage rates, with a
44-hour week; the sugar producers want
reductions.
Part of the A.W.U.’s case is that,
before the cut in 1930, the wage for mill
and field hands was 2s. 2.1 d. an hour
in southern districts. It is now Is.
10.5 d., a drop of 14.3 p.c. Reductions
in the State basic wage paid to other
than sugar-workers have not exceeded
12.9 p.c. The home price is down 11.1
p.c. ; it is argued that the heavy export
surplus this year was a windfall to the
grower, as it was excess sugar that didn’t
increase his costs.
The growers’ association says that the
£l6 3s. 6d. a ton averaged last year was
below cost of production, and quotes
figures compiled by J. B. Brigden, of
the Bureau of Industry. Prospects
“Which one is the pork pie?”
for the coming crop, estimated at
642,000 tons, were no better. The
world price was still weak, and the ex-
port surplus might not fetch even last
year’s price. Out of 4921 farms, 50 p.c.
were at present subject to crop liens.
In 1921, when the minimum wage was
2s. an hour, the cost of living index was
1637, and raw sugar was £3O 6s. Bd. a
ton. To-day, with sugar averaging £l6
3s. 6d., the wage rate was Is. 10.5 d. an
hour, and the cost of living index 1228.
The Court consists of Webb, J., and
W. J. Riordan and T. A. Ferry.
Ten Months’ Trade
Surplus of exports over imports for
the ten months to April 31 amounted to
£39,087,676 sterling. The commodity
balance was £13,384,000 stronger at
£33,113,000 sterling.
Imports remained practically un-
changed over the period, but exports of
merchandise were £13,568,000 higher at
£81,397,000. Wool represented 49.2 p.c. of
the exports ; with sheepskins it accounted
for 51 p.c.
Figures show that Australians continue
to drink more tea (up £740,000 stg.),
while motor chassis increased £871,000.
Cotton goods imports were down
£653,000; silks, £307,000; sacks and
bags, £535,000 ; petrol, £309,000.
We sold £250,000 (Aust.) worth more
raisins, £366,000 more lamb, and sugar
exports increased £795,500. Butter was
down £969,500, wheat £8,263,000, and
flour £782,500.
Principal purchasers of Australian
wool had the following bills to pay:
U.K., £16,695,807 (Aust.); France,
£4,478,511; Belgium, £6,391,021; Ger-
many, £8,393,913 ; Italy, £3,902,058 ; and
Japan, £11,759,484.
The Tariff Board is inquiring into the
present 35 p.c. British and 55 p.c. general
tariffs on blankets. Stated in evidence
for retention of duties that blankets were
the first woollens manufactured in Aus-
tralia, and that the present comparative
prosperity of the trade came only after
many years of struggle; also that the
local market for blankets had fallen from
£750,814 in 1928-29 to £372,338 in 1931-
32. Victorian mills alone are capable
of supplying the whole of Australia’s
requirements; 1,369,341 blankets have
been turned out in a year by all mills,
but the demand has shrunk to 783,289.
In 1933 blanket imports from Britain
were valued at only £7948, from the
U.S.A. £3385 and Japan £8713.
Adelaide is having its Stock Exchange
gold boom, too. During the week to
June 2, 619,000 gold shares exchanged
hands, mainly Westralian stocks. Not
since the Bullfinches fluttered their wings
a quarter of a century back has there
been such feverish trading.
* * * *
There is a spurt in tin as well as in
gold. U.S.A. usually takes 50 p.c. or
more of world output. Tin stocks
at the end of May had fallen to 16,788
tons, which is near the minimum in keep-
ing with present demands. Production
and consumption of the metal are now
about equal, and at present prices most
dredging companies are showing a profit.

Following the death of a Melbourne
woman from an overdose of barbitone
and aspirin, taken as medicine, the Phar-
macy Board advised the Vic. Chief Secre-
tary that while aspirin perhaps shouldn’t
be added to the schedule of poisons, it
could be more appropriately included in
the list of potent drugs. Dr. H. N. Fea-
tonby mentioned, in support of aspirin,
that a patient had taken 261 b. of the
drug (four grammes a day) over nine
years, and that a man had absorbed 600
grains in a vain attempt to commit
suicide. Commission of Public Health
declined to take action.
St. James Theatre, Sydney, which for
some years has been exhibiting talkies,
passes under “a long lease” to Metro-
Goldwyn-Mayer. The theatre is to be
redecorated and opened under the new
control next month.

Four or five years ago gramophone
shares were among London’s most popu-
lar investments. Last week the two lead-
ing manufacturers of talking machines
and records, the Gramophone Co. (“His
Master’s Voice”) and Columbia Grapho-
phone, applied to the Chancery Court
for permission to write off £734,000 and
£72,000 of capital respectively. The
Gramophone Co. dropped £606,000 dur-
ing the year to June, 1932, and the whole
of Columbia’s reserves have vanished in
the same way. Popularity of wireless
largely wiped out the demand for
records.

W. H. Wright, a Papuan planter who
made a success of desiccating cocoanut,
is going to start a tea plantation in
B.N.G. Knight Hubert Murray, Lieut.-
Governor of Papua, is barracking for the
new enterprise. Wright has had tea-
planting experience in Ceylon.
* * * *
“Laputa”: Once more the idea of ex-
tracting gold from sea-water is being
seriously put forward. Pretty well every-
one who has dabbled in gold recoveries
has been told the old tale that
the salt seas hold some 14 bil-
lion ounces of gold, but a good
many hundreds of thousands must
have been blown in on extrac-
tion schemes —writer can recall one which
was to operate near Sydney years ago.
However, with gold prices high and going
higher, and the advance of chemical re-
search, several new schemes are being
put forward. One is advanced by
Thomas Midgley, who is tipping that iu
a few years gold can be won from sea-
water at a good profit on a £6 10s. an
ounce basis. Midgley is entitled to re-
spect, for he was one of the developers
of tetra-ethyl-lead, which eliminated
“knocking” from petrol. To-day, 15,000
pounds of bromine is being daily re-
covered from sea-water at Kure Beach
(U.S.A.) and worked up into ethylene-
dibromide for motor fuel.
* * * *
“Double Express”: It looks as if the
good old days of the elephant-shooter
are gone for ever. Up to a few years
ago Burroughs and Watts, and one or
two other makers of billiard balls, took
10,000 East African tusks yearly. Then
composite makes came along, and to-day
even championship matches, in which
ivory balls were once de rigueur, are
played with artificial ivory. I suppose
that is all to the good of the elephant,
but it has practically wiped out of busi-
ness a class of men who, from Selous
upwards (or down, if you like), were
assets to the Empire.
* * * *
“P. Penwiper”: “Give It a Name”
competitions (sixpence a try) are already
developing ancillary industries. A free
paper which was shoved on to my
doorstep contains the ad. of “How
to Write a Winning ‘Give It a Name’
Title,” alleged to be “by a Prominent
Journalist.” It costs a shilling to get the
assistance of the guide, with “a com-
plete list of the double meanings con-
tained in the current picture.”

THESE EAST FEW
YEARS
These last few years have, in a marked or lesser degree,
proved to all the wisdom of making some provision for the
future. All of us have experienced the unexpected financial
calls of everyday life, and, while it is impossible to gauge
accurately the needs of the future, it is possible to provide
for them.
A Savings Account costs nothing to open, and can be
opened nearly anywhere in Australia. With it and the regular
saving of money, however small the amounts, adequate pro-
vision for the unexpected calls will be made.

The Other Fellow’s Mind.
The Road to Anywhere
To-day, every river and many of the
roads are lined with an army of home-
less nomads. Taking the Murrumbidgee
as an example, it is calculated that there
are 3000 between Gundagai and Went-
worth. Resourceful folk, for the most
part (Communists and stump orators
cling to the unemployment camps and
the dole), they sell fish, rabbits and live
birds, paper flowers, grass mats, tin and
wire kitchen utensils. Thieving by them
is almost unknown, but women with
young children occasionally beg food and
old clothes. No bushdweller turns them
away; at harvest-time and shearing the
men get odd jobs.
Old covered waggonettes and sulkies
are the most popular means of transport.
Horses, dogs and poultry are bred in
numbers ; as for themselves, birth-con-
trol is about the last thing thought of.
But this is the rub: very few who are
born into or become adapted to that kind
of life will rarely ever settle down to
the humdrum of hard or regular work.
Month by month the army increases. In
the not distant future it will be some-
thing to be reckoned with, especially at
election-time. — Jim Grahame (N.S.W.).
The Anti-Motor Obsession
I have been instructed to convey a
resolution, carried unanimously at a
general meeting, that members of the
N.S.W. Motor Van Owners’ Association
highly commend the editor for the
articles “Putting the Clock Back” and
“The Anti-Motor Campaign,” which ap-
peared in The Bulletin on May 30 and
June 6 respectively. The members state
that the articles have driven home to
Governments the criticism they deserve ;
also that The Bulletin deserves the
patronage of Australian citizens for its
fearless exposure of Government policy
and legislation. I, as secretary, concur. —
B. Fitzgerald (N.S.W.).
Proposed Return to the Bottle I
Whatever else it has done, the depres-
sion hasn’t taught the Empire Develop-
ment and Research Committee a thing.
In its general report the E.D. and R.C.
discusses the problem of surplus popula-
tion in the old familiar terms. Migra-
tion from the homelands has ceased ; the
expected expansion into the Dominions
has not taken place; Australia’s popula-
tion has hardly increased at all, and, at
the same time, Australia and Canada
have been vigorously building up their
secondary industries. Cities continue to
grow and the country to decline.
The present stagnation, the committee
sadly concludes, is fatal, and the remedy
for a fatal disease is to export more
Britons to the Dominions. It does not
explain what the Dominions are to do
with them. A new loan drunk is appar-
ently the committee’s aim. It ought to
be told that Australia has had enough
of that.—C. B. (Vic.).
Robbery as a Fine Art
Under this heading The Bulletin dealt
with the extortion practised by the N. S.
Wales Taxation Department in collecting
unemployed-relief taxation. I can show
where a taxpayer has been taxed on
“income” which he never had.
A man on a fixed salary (on
which wages, Federal and State taxes
are levied), he invested his small sav-
ings in an equity in a dairy farm
With the assistance of the bank he was
able to erect the necessary buildings and
equip and stock the farm. He installed
a share-farmer, thereby doing his bit
towards relieving unemployment.
In November, 1932, the farm com-
menced to produce earnings, and for the
eight months to June 30, 1933, his net
return was £lO4, which he declared. His
assessment showed that the department
had increased his taxable income from
the farm to £260.
The “adjustment” sheet herewith (the
department knew he was still in a salaried
position).
Owing to the change in the class of your
income from “Income from Employment
(Wages)” to “Business Income” it has
been deemed necessary, in order that tax
would not be avoided, to adjust your
assessment on the following basis:
Net Business Income for 8 months
• as per return £lO4
Add 12 months’ assumed income
from trading as under:
8 months’ trading (as above) £lO4
104 X 12
12 months’ trading = .. 156
8
Net assessable income .. .. £260
In other words the taxpayer’s real in-
come has been increased l\ times, and
he has nothing to show for the sum
added. Had he left his small savings in
safe securities his actual income would
have been very much less than £104.

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
Territory Population
“Kaloa”: The Census Summary shows
that N.T. people who are not abos.
number 4850, of whom 2038 are in
Darwin and environs and another 526
at Alice Springs. There is roughly one
dwelling to every 380 square miles of
country, but 838 of the total of 1300
are packed into three towns. Two-
thirds of the inhabitants are not
married. A third of the non-abos.
were born outside Australia and the
British Isles, but a good many born in
Australia are, of course, Chinese.
For all the disabilities, a lot of residents
seem to like, the climate. Over 250 of
them have been there a generation or
upwards. One hero has withstood its
rigors for over 75 years, and three others
for over 70 years. The place is a true
democracy—only 462 persons have in-
comes of more than £260 p.a. As 302
persons are employed professionally or in
the civil service, it is a fairly safe bet as
to who constitute the staple of the pluto-
crats. There are 12 pubs, one to every
40,000 square miles, and 13 boarding-
houses, and 344 persons whose dwellings
are labelled as “wagon, van, etc.” One
house in every four has only one room
and 75 p.c. have four rooms or fewer.
Only 130 have more than five rooms —
the pubs and boarding-houses account
for several of these. And rents are a fair
cow up north. There is actually a house
in Darwin for which £2 a week is paid.
The hoi polloi get their castles for from
ss, a week upwards.
“Kaloa”: I often wonder what the
ghosts of William MacGregor and other
pioneers must think of modern goings-
on in Papua. “The Poreporena native
choir gave a concert in the Institute
Hall Items included ‘My Old
Kentucky Home’ and ‘Old Black
Joe’.... The Girl Guides gave a first-
aid display, treating an alleged case of
snakebite.... A native Boy Scout danced
a sailors’ hornpipe, and there was
a sketch entitled ‘The Gamblers.’ ” Even
“go slow” has been introduced, and when
a manager near Samarai remonstrated
with his employees, who were applying
this new democratic technique, they
picketed him with the aid of an axe, a
stick with a heavy cog-wheel tied to it,
an iron bar and some other persuasive
implements. He is now in hospital, and
11 of the democrats are under arrest. I
should have liked to see any native going
slow with Wullie MacGregor!
.*' * * *
“X.T.”: Papua is producing quite a re-
spectable amount of rubber —1,320,0001 b.
for the last six months recorded. It
seems an industry worth cultivating
assiduously—one of those which go to
make a country self-contained. The
U.S.A. would give both Uncle Sam’s ears
for an adequate local rubber output.
* * * *
“Kaloa”: The skill which enabled
Australian souvenir-hunters to remove
a sight from a 4.7 gun on a visiting
battleship is not failing, as witness the
plea of Dr. Goddard, a Queensland pro-
fessor, that they should not be allowed
to remove the Barrier Reef, which is
disappearing piecemeal in tourist lug-
gage. Trippers lug away coral, which dies
when it leaves the water, and a few clam-
shells for the front garden. Govern-
ment supervision is undoubtedly needed.
It would be a pity to see the Barrier go
the way of Canberra’s brass sundial.
* * * *
“Pandanus”: I agree with “Porosus”
(B. 30/5/’34) that crocodiles are becom-
ing a menace in some of our northern
streams. They soon get used to river
traffic, and on the Norman and several
other rivers I have seen dozens of them
sunning themselves along the banks, too
lazy to glide into the water at the
approach of a passer-by. They are hard
brutes to poison, but they don’t like
dynamite. Their diet is varied. I once
shot a 12ft. croc, on the Endeavour, and
beside the hardware he was carrying
around inside him were 16 flying-foxes.
The flying-fox cannot land, and drinks
by tipping the water whilst in flight.
It is then that Scaly grabs his prey.
* * * *
“Cudgerie”: Cooktown in our Far
North needs telephonic communication
with Cairns, but not by the route that
“Travel Stain” (B. 30/5/’34) suggests.
The line at present extends 13 miles
south of Cooktown to the lighthouse at
Archer Point, and 67 miles westward
along the telegraph line to the Laura.
Why not continue along the telegraph
line south from the Laura to Mount Sur-
prise and thence to Cairns? To link
up the Bloomfield, China Camp and
the Daintree settlements would involve
clearing scrub tracks to at least one
chain wide for more than 100 miles, and
building the line over densely jungle-
clad mountains. And a gang would have
to be constantly employed with brush-
hooks and repair outfits. Give Cook-
town the line by the Mount Surprise-
Laura route, and, in case of cyclone
warnings, instal small wireless-receiving
and -transmission sets in the isolated
Daintree and Tinfields settlements.
* * # *
“Kuranda”: Queensland’s Minister for
Agriculture Bulcock has evolved a plan
for growing coffee, having discovered
areas suitable for the purpose. Also
he is thinking of tea-growing, and has
visions of that turning out profitably.
“Twins, eh, Mary ? Which of ’em ’ll talk first, eh, Jacky ?”
“That pfella. Him lubra.”
Thirty-five years ago writer knew two
young Irishmen named De Moleyns who
ran a coffee plantation behind Cairns.
There were others on Buderim in the
south. The coffee they marketed was
first-class, and in New Guinea, where
B.P. handled it, it was preferred to the
imported stuff. That little enterprise
crashed when Queensland entered the
Federation.

“Alma”: If Central Queensland can’t
produce a gloomy dean to rail against
the decadence of modern humanity, it at
least has a gloomy Judge. “Girls,” says
our Judge Brennan, “run the house and
tell their parents to go to blazes. Instead
of their being flogged, they control the
home.... And these young men, they
won’t go into the country to find work.
They get 13s. a week, bingo and free love
in the city, so why should they?” I
wish ’Sonah had lived in our district a
generation ago. When I went to school
in Mt. Morgan, there was flogging and
to spare. When our kindly tutor had
done with some of us we looked more
zebra than human, and to show our peni-
tence we used to retire to the creek bank
and bet on which of us had the most and
biggest stripes. Yet I doubt whether
it improved our morals or conduct. In-
deed, I am sure that the present genera-
tion is better behaved in every way than
we were when both sexes of us used to
get a weekly dose of strap oil,

“Futtack Deen”: An Emerald (Q.)
three-year-old was discovered sharing a
snake as a plaything with the cat. Serpo
would rise on his tail and the toddler
would grab it. Then the cat would pull it
away. The artless scene was interrupted
by the entry of a lady with boiling water.
The papers must be getting a bit namby-
pamby when they publish tales like this.
Nobody ever wrote about my old friend
Jimmy O’Rourke, for instance. When
he was in his second childhood out at
Hatch’s Creek, he used to play with 16
snakes, colored in seven different grades,
at once. He was in the habit of tying
them head to tail, in true lovers’ knots,
and, using the local bunyip for a stump
and his battery of fantods for scouts,
he would play quoits with them by the
hour. He had them trained, moreover, to
form themselves into a Union Jack, and
salute when the police arrived. After
which he would say “Hooshta! ” to them,
and they would all lie down and die. I
should like to introduce a cat into the
story, but the only one that ever was in
Hatch’s Creek was eaten for supper. But
there was a camel, and he was once found
playing with a snake. He was on top,
blissfully chewing his cud, and the snake
was underneath, looking as if he had just
seen his income-tax return.

“Red Poll”: Speaking at the Q.M.I.
Board’s first carcass-dressing competition,
chairman E. F. Sunners referred to the
freight hurdle facing the chilled-meat
trade. The frozen-meat rate is .818 d.
(Australian) a pound. The Idomeneus
shipment of chilled was charged on
the basis of the chilling-hold’s frozen-
beef stowage. Freight was 1.02 d.
per pound. The next shipment, owing
to space wastage, cost 1.14 d. per
pound. The shipping companies have
now fixed the rate at 1.475 d. This makes
the shipping of crops with hinds unprofit-
able, and without including crops a satis-
factory stowage cannot be got. It is
worth noting the comparative rates on
chilled and frozen beef from Maoriland
and the Argentine. In M.L. the rate
for frozen is ,694 d. (sterling) and for
chilled ,760 d. per pound. From the
Argentine the charge on frozen is .551 d.
(sterling) and on chilled 9-16 d. per
pound, plus 10 per cent, per 105 cubic
feet,, less 2 p.c. The Australian rate
“is, in my opinion, ridiculous,” Mr. Sun-
ners summed up.

At All Saints’, Cynthia Mary Keon-Cohen
married Donald Rutherford Morell. The
families of both parties hail from Melbourne,

would improve the dairying industry’s finances
to the tune of £300,000 a year.

Rumor is muttering
persistently that Gov-

During Sir Matthew

broke their fall, but the lasses had to be put
to bed and treated for a number of scratches

Mrs. Firmin McKinnon and Mollie Butler
entertained at a bridge party at Mrs. McKin-

spring-green windswept cloth. Sunflowers in
bowls and vases made gay the reception

Studies in still-life hold pride of place in
the Art Society’s exhibition, officially opened by
our Sir Leslie. Vida Lahey shows three
flower paintings, of which “Frangipanni” and
“Peach Blossoms” are the best. President C.
H. Lancaster is represented by six pictures, and
in two of them has taken his inspiration from
the gumtree. Stanhope Hobday exhibits three
water-colors. “Winter Twilight” is a cold
fairy dream of shadows thrown into water. A
single monotype, “Sun Dappled,” represents
this side of his art. P. S. Templeton’s best
work is a water-color, “Early Morning.”
Frank Payne (Mrs. Clinton) has an oil
painting of a young mother and her infant
sun-bathing on the beach. Gwen Grant has dis-
covered the possibilities of the Australian abo.
as a model. Billie Bustard’s magnolias are so
realistic that one sniffs involuntarily on seeing
them. Enid Dicksen shows a portrait study
which is lifelike. Hubert Jarvis, with a brush
dipped in magic, shows children playing on a
beach beneath the many-hued arc of a rain-
bow. Marion Jack has made great improvement
in the last few years. Her “Green Jar” (pastel)
evinces originality and a sure color sense.
Sculptress Daphne Mayo has a beautiful sketch
model for a stone figure, “Continuity of Life.”
Her portrait head, in bronze, is one of the
outstanding exhibits. L. J. Harvey, using
beech-wood as his medium, has given several
wood-carvings—most lifelike—and sends a col-
lection of pottery. M. A. Macdonald (matron
of Ardoyne Hospital), M. McDiarmid, Jeanette
Sheldon and S. E. Bott also are adepts at the
potter’s art, and Alice Bott is represented by
desirable hand-painted china.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
The Australian Flying Corps held its
dance at Nock and Kirby’s. To this
came a white-lace-clad Jean Batten, and
found awaiting her the association’s
badge in gold, on its wings the diamond
letters “A.F.C.” Major A. W. L. Ellis
handed over this bauble, and Thelma
Goldthorpe, president of the younger
members, in trailing black velvets, pre-
sented a basket spilling over with wattle,
carnations and violets —a sprig of the
wattle, the flying girl says, she will keep.
Mrs. Ellis’s frock was of old-gold crepe.
Air Commodore Goble and Flight-Lieut.
Knox, of Melbourne, were among the
night’s honored. Mrs. C. T. Ulm wore
black velvet, and brought her flier-hus-
band to keep her company. Secretary J.
Winslow’s wife covered her windswept
crepes with a lame coat.
The Chinese costume is always eye-
arresting. Among the national attire
represented at the International Ball it
stood out for beauty. Elma See wore
The sun shone for 'the second day of
the winter meeting at Randwick, but
there was enough nip in the air to make
pelts a joy to the wearer and the be-
holder. Silver-fox won by a head, cer-
tainly not by a neck. Lynx was a close
runner-up. Mrs. W. H. Mackay’s black
coat sported a collar of this attractive
fur ; so did Mrs. E. A. Eakin’s brown
coat. Mrs. James Burns’s white tarn car-
ried one of the new glass ornaments.
Silver-foxes added a note of luxury to
her black ensemble. The McKelvey lady
also stuck to fox; hers was a smoked
grey, which she wore as a collar to her
navy boucle trig-fitting coat. Enid Bayley
wore a smart black-and-white-striped
jersey blouse under her black coat. Rachel
Joy Morton’s coat sported sable trim-
mings on sleeves and collar. Mrs. Sam
Hardy’s attractive little hat was made of
the same material as her costume —white
and blue shepherd’s check. Judy Bur-
leigh flaunted a tricolor scarf, and Phil-
lipa Stephen’s grey Angoras went well
with her horizon-blue hat.
Rosemont, home of Mr. and Mrs. C.
Lloyd Jones, Woollahra, housed the nicest
cocktail party of the week. Sir Hamilton
Harty was the reason. It was one of
those clieery affairs that make the late-
comer think everyone is talking and no
one is listening. Log fires burned in all
the rooms; lily-of-the-valley, cool and
aloof-looking, was massed on mantel-
pieces, tables and cabinets, but corners
glowed with the ’ golds and reds of J
autumn. )
The black crepes worn by the hostess
had spring-leaf-green sleeves. They were
of the new order (almost magyar), very
wide, cut into the bodice and narrowing
at the wrists. Her hat was a wisp of
black tulle wreathed in ospreys. Irish
soprano Laelia Finneberg’s hat was of
the same family. The Premier Stevens
couple came to shake the hand that
wields the baton ; so did the Attorney-
General Mannings and the Chief Justice
Jordans. Professors, musicians, medical
men, legal men were there by the score,
and with their wives. The W. G. Laytons
had a word with everyone. Peter Osborn,
Ann Gordon and Margaret Hughes
hobnobbed. Gladys Marks and many of
the Consuls left early—they were going
to see “Le Vol Nuptial” at the Savoy.
With one gesture the Musical Associa-
tion welcomed Sir Hamilton Harty, the
visiting A.B.C. conductor, and the new
Con. Director, Dr. Edgar Bainton. Both
are by way of becoming popular ; Sir
Hamilton has already a name for telling
a witty story: Arundel Orchard, the just-
retired Con. Director, brought his wife,
and Dorothy Gibbes, Lloyd Evan Davies
and Gladstone Bell filled 'he rooms with
the magic of the Orchard Trio in D
Minor. Sir Hamilton heard his own
“Wistful Song” played by ’cellist Bell.
Elsa Corry, in Lia’s aria from Debussy’s
“L’Enfant Prodique,” showed the kind
of singing-birds Australia produces.
There were the usual speeches, but, so
far as this Letter heard, no one paid a
tribute to Will Holman, who had died
that day, and under whose Ministry
Sydney was given its Verbrugghen and
its Conservatorium.
All the women were fur-coated, fur-
collared or both. Mrs. C. L. Jones’s
cocoa ermines hid mulberry velvets, high
as to back, and long and slim as to
sleeves. A glittering coronet adorned
Mrs. John McPhillamy’s head, and Mrs.
T. H. Kelly’s hair curled in an intriguing
manner above amethystine velvets. At
supper Aldrovandi and his opera broad-
casts provided conversation for almost
every table.
it. It was of white, embroidered in gold,
with a towering bejewelled headdress.
Eugenie McNeill seemed the spirit of
Mexico in her enormous hat with the
huge poinsettia under its brim, her red
skirt and her red, blue and green striped
scarf. Boy Scouts were everywhere;
they held flags, cleared the way for the
debs, and formed a guard of honor for
the vice-regals.
Consuls from all the countries in the
League of Nations brought parties. The
G.-G.’s lady wore gold and ivory
brocades, and the Street lady’s laces
were silver. They and Acting-Governor
Street smiled kindly on the 13 youngsters
who shyly bowed before being whirled
away by their partners in the debs.’
dance. The Chief Justice Jordans were
there. Her frock of sky-after-rain-blue
had a silver lining to its train. The
Gordon lady, president of the shivoo,
wore mulberry chiffons. A gold thread
ran through Mrs. C. L. Jones’s white
crepes. Secretary Ellis Dettmann’s let-
tuce-green crepes swished a train ; Mrs.
Linda Littlejohn’s black chiffons were
silver rose embossed; and towards mid-
night Jean Batten arrived in white laces
Sir Hamilton Harty’s hands fascinated
the audience at the A.B.C. concert on
Saturday. It adored the way he coaxed
and bullied the orchestra to do what he
wanted. He made no speeches.
The v.-rs. wanted to enjoy the concert
to the full, so they had their seats moved
to the Clock Gallery. (They usually sit
in the body of the hall, just at the feet
of the orchestra.) The Lindley Evanses
sat high also, as did the C. L. Joneses,
her ermine coat sporting a white fox
collar. The Bavin lady’s coat was fur,
daughter Valerie’s velvet; both wore blue
gowns. Laelia Finneberg had a collar of
white coque feathers on her black wrap.
The Professorial Fawsitts were appre-
ciative listeners, as also were Bertie and
Mrs. T. H. Kelly. The Archdale Parkhills
were there; so were Mrs. F. J. Davy, Lute
Drummond, Czecho-Slovakia Consul
ICuraz and the E. J. Taits. And members
of the orchestra didn’t know till the con-
cert was over how exhausted they were.
The subject of the pencil drawing
is Joan Osborne Wilkinson, who
will lead the Wool Set in the
Extra Chukka Ball, which will
take place on June 28 at
David Jones’s. The girls in
this group will wear vividly
red satin dresses with
white wool capes and
hats. These days Joan
is busy flat-hunting, for
her marriage to “Din-
ger” Bode will take
place some time in
September.
Vinia de Loitte gave one of her bright
and breezy evenings last week. Dressed
in white angel-skin, weighted at the hem
with a broad band of fur, Vinia sang
Gilsullivan ditties and told amusing
stories of people she had met. Her last
item was her mental reactions, expressed
in music, of a tram trip from King-street
to King’s Cross. Then Dorothy Dunck-
ley took the floor and drew a vivid word-
picture of Aimee Semple McPherson,
whom she started out to jeer at but ended
up by admiring for her courage, gener-
osity and showmanship.
Among those who thoroughly enjoyed
the brilliant dialogue of “Le Vol Nuptial”
was the G.-G.’s lady. She wore an
ermine tippet over a gold lame coat, and
sat in the front row of the crowded
Savoy in company with Acting-Governor
Street, his lady, French Consul-General
Dussaps and Madame Segaert, wife of
Belgium’s Consul. Henri Segaert, who
produced the play, was the ace-aviator
Pierre whose love of women was only
exceeded by his love of the spectacular
in flying.
Hortense (Eva Kuraz), one of Pierre s
lady friends, wears a ravishing coat ot
brown velvet over pale gold crepes.
Jacqueline (the heroine, also an ace, and
Pierre’s wife) has an equally gorgeous
frock of mulberry velvets, cut high m
front, but with cowled back. The elbow
sleeves are like V-shaped pockets. The\
are made of bands of velvet caught
together with stitching.
Everyone respected and most people
liked W. A. Holman, whose passing robs
Sydney of one of its most romantic
figures. The Government honored him
with a State funeral. Dr. Micklem con-
ducted the service, and the Dean of Syd-
ney gave the address. St. James s was
packed, and W. M. Hughes was one
of the pallbearers. Quite early crowds
started to gather, and soon King-street
and all the rest of the route were lined
with people to pay tribute to a man all
knew by name and many personally.
The procession was headed by the
mounted police, and they and the hearse
were half-way down George-street before
the last car left the church. A widow
and daughter are left in sorrow.
The knightly Tom Bavins will soon
have another son-in-law, for daughter
Nancy has cabled news of her engagement
to Lawrence Harry, son of the J. D. Gul-
lands, of Bourne Hall, Bushey, Herts.
Nancy, who is staying with her sister
Shirley (Shirley married Commander
J. Horn), met her fate on a pleasure
cruise to the Isles of Greece. The ring,
a diamond and sapphire affair, was
bought at Glasgow, the last port of call.
The young man is a graduate of Cam-
bridge, a brilliant classical scholar, and
a master at one of the great public
schools. Nancy has literary ability, and
has met with some success in London.
Another engagement is that of Valerie
Baird to H. Becher, of the R.A.N.
Valerie is the daughter of the Henry
Bairds, whose cocktail party at the
Queen’s Club gave friends an opportunity
of offering congratulations.
The engagement is announced of Edith
Lilian, fourth daughter of the W. C.
Millers, of Coreena station, Barcaldine
(Q.), to Kenneth Lyall Mackenzie, of
Maranda, in the same locality. Ken-
neth is the eldest son of the K. O. Mac-
kenzies, of Manly.
Two young things whose doings will
be chronicled in the press from now on
are Desiree Ross and Phillipa Sanders.
They were among the reasons for the
naval Randle Fords’ dance in the Can-
berra. Another reason was that these
well-liked recent-comers wished to show
heir pleasure at the Rear-Admiral’s ap-
pointment to Sydney. The ship was all
dressed up in red and orange bunting.
Mrs. Ford trailed black satins, her short
silver lame coat glowing faintly pink
above its rosy lining.
Among those who cheered the polo at
Cobbity, Mrs. Venour Nathan was one
of the smartest. She wore Robin Hood
green, with hat, gloves and stock of
brown suede ; Mrs. Oscar Ireland was
one of the most attractive in green,
orange and beige tweeds, and Mrs. James
Ashton, in black-and-white plaid, was
one of the most cheerful.
Sydney was shocked when it heard of
the death of Phyllis Cade. Phyllis and
her sister Kirry were well known for
their good looks. An operation for ap-
pendicitis was performed on Phyllis
some weeks ago, and, apparently quite
well again, she was planning a holiday
when a cold brought on pneumonia.
Great sympathy is felt for Kirry and
her mother ; the latter, by the way, is
also very ill.
The R.S.P.C.A. Ball is to take
place on June 19 at the Blaxland Gal-
leries. This is a dance in which all
society takes an interest, so tickets are
selling rapidly. Artists are painting pic-
tures which will be auctioned during the
evening.


Melbourne
Chatter
Moonee Valley Racing Club has aug-
mented the number of its garden-seats on
the sloping lawns in front of the stand —
and very popular the new additions
proved in Saturday’s sunshine. There is
also an enlarged dressing-room where
generously-proportioned mirrors are so
arranged that a discriminating woman
may study the effect of her face in a
little more make-up and the panorama
outside in the same mirror. The silver
fox family was there in force, one shoul-
der being the average allotment for each
beast. Mrs. Albion Walkley wore her
blue-blooded animal on a black coat
smart with buttons and a white camellia ;
her velvet tarn ran to a little eye-veil.
Mrs. U. J. Nicholas also chose a velvet
headpiece, and daughter Judith had a
blue woollen blouse under her navy suit
and an air-vent at the top of her saucy
knitted cap. A vivid emerald parrot had
left a wing on Mrs. A. B. Paterson’s
black velvet beret, and her black coat
sheltered a silver lamd blouse. Phyllis
Mein was all brick-red with a bow at the
throat, and sister Alison was trim in black
with white gauntlets to match the cord
round her hat.
Mrs. Barry Thomson, with a whisk of
summer ermine on the crown of her hat,
sat in her favorite stand, the one with
the steam heaters. Mrs.. Harold Nathan
wore a bunch of violets in her caracul
coat, and, unexpectedly, a brown hat.
Mrs. L. Vane chose black ribbed velvet
and perky silver wings above her ears.
Mr. and Mrs. A. V. Hiskens were there ;
also Dr. and Mrs. McLean, Dr. Lorna
Bray and Mrs. Ben Chaffey with sable
tails dangling to her waist. Mrs. A. G.
Hunter was in blue corded velvet. Enid
Thompson was one of the smart tweedy
young things, her dark-blue suit being
flecked and worn with a belt. A black
dress with buttons right down to the hem
at the back of the skirt was worn by a
visitor from Burma —Mrs. Hogan-Tayor.
As a result of the party on the Wes-
tralia for the Blanket Fund, the winter
looms less grim for many poor families.
Chief Officer N. Cook looked thought-
ful when it was decided that bridge
would be played on the starboard deck,
for he feared for feminine ears in the
firing-line of wharf-lumpers’ language.
Sunbeams filtered through the canvas and
gay bunting, and if highly colored nouns
and adjectives accompanied them, they
were not sufficiently unusual to raise
players’ heads from their cards. Early-
comers grabbed tables in an Indian sum-
mer atmosphere behind glass windows,
and non-players listened to music in the
lounge. There was such a satisfactory
rally that the dining-room was filled twice
over for tea. Mrs. Ernest Cox, mating
ermine tails and perfume from a spray of
lily-of-the-valley, kept an experienced
hand on the helm.
Baron Marks and Frank Faulkner were
early arrivals. Captain Darroch was
gallant, as always. It being his home
port, Mrs. Darroch was able to pay the
ship a visit. She had violets pinned to
her fur coat. Among the players were
Mrs. Norman Shepherd, Mrs. Charles
Wilson, wrapped in fur, Amy Cullen, in
black, and Mrs. Maurice Patkin. Mrs.
E. M. Ricker flourished an ice-blue
hankie to match the dash upon neckline
and halo-hat. Myra Marsh, who had
robbed some diminutive beast of his tail
to trim her hat, scurried backwards and
forwards between the port suite and the
deck with trays of nuts, sweets and
cigarettes. The Huddart, Parker Co.
gave the ship, the sweets and the tea.
The Palais looked marvellous for the
Rotary Club Ball. Cabaret tables were
arranged round the dancing-floor, along
the terraces and in cosy nooks where
they were almost hidden by tall baskets
of splendid chrysanthemums and dwarf
trees in tubs. The decorative effect of
clusters of balloon lights was repeated in
real balloons which did their best to
escape their anchorage and sail aloft to
the gold-lit ceiling and a revolving wheel
of flowers. Supper was very sumptuous.
Preliminaries like olives and chocolates
were already on the tables when the
guests arrived, turkey came on at 11,
and after midnight 1000 revellers sought
sustenance upon beef-tea and piping-hot
nibbles of cocktail-sausages.
Rotary president Fred Walker brought
his wife in black lace and satin and
daughter Sheila in honey georgette with
a spiked and baubled halo band. Marion
Steel, in flame and green, was one of the
busy secs. Mrs. J. Nowack, in black
velvet, was a-glitter with diamente
upon her wrist, her bag and her hair-
band. Daughter Phyllis had in her hair
meadow-flowers of the same soft pink as
her ripply frock with its high draped
neckline; schoolgirl Sylvia was in green
with a primped and flounced synthetic
sleeve.
Mrs. P. A. Oakley was followed by
an elongation of chiffon train from
under the edge of a wine-red velvet wrap.
Lurline Highett’s dress had silver strap-
pings upon blue. Elizabeth Dutton-Green
wore violets in her hair and on the
corsage of her lizard-green chiffons.
Mrs. Geoff Fethers, in a gown of misty-
blue, had its shoulder importance stressed
with padded “shock absorbers.” Mrs.
L. R. Stillman was sheathed in the liquid
fall of silver lame. Belle Craig’s black
velvet burst into white in unexpected
places. Mabel Pearson’s organdie was
starched and pale primrose, and Ellis
Nicholson managed an ice-blue train
with discretion. Mrs. O. Yuncken wore
a spray of red rosebuds, and her
daughter, when not dancing, wrapped
herself in a white bunny coat.
Cricket fans discovered a radio in a
quiet corner and crept off to listen to
scores of the first Test until unsympa-
thetic partners discovered the truants and
dragged them back by the ears —the girls
considered there was no excuse for let-
ting good music go to waste, especially
when a loudspeaker announced the
cricket happenings at intervals.
Joyce Macbeth, for two years profes-
sional ice-skating champion of Great
Britain, has come out to delight the eye
on Melbourne’s Glaciarium. Miss Mac-
beth is only 20 and possesses well-
groomed fair curls, a cold-weather com-
plexion, a beautiful figure and an attrac-
tive English accent. She wears her skat-
ing dresses with very short full skirts and
snugly-fitting corsages. This is her first
trip so far away from home, but she
went to Switzerland last year for train-
ing and practice and has visited Paris for
holidays. Her father was organiser of
the Manchester Skating Club and bought
his small daughter her first skates when
she was only five. Miss Macbeth has
given exhibitions all over the British
Isles and spent last summer at Bourne-
mouth doing a skating number in a revue
called “Gypsy Nights.” At .the termina-
tion of her season here she will return to
her job as professional at London’s
luxurious Park Lane Ice Club. Picture

Cars came from far and wide on
Saturday afternoon to All Saints’,
Terang, for the marriage of Prudence
Staughton and James Holden. Prudence
is the third daughter of the A. J.
Staughtons and one of Vic.’s loveliest
girls. The ’groom is the second son of
Mr. and Mrs. H. W. Holden, of Warra-
wee, N. S. Wales, and will take his bride
to live in Adelaide. The wedding gar-
ment of parchment satin was cut with an
Empire corsage, long sleeves, and tail
wings flying out at the back of the waist
like a suggestion of bustle. The head-
dress of jasmine and orange-buds, with
a quaint Tudor peak in line with the
forehead, had a cunning frill at the back
which was an anchorage for the foaming
tulle veil. In the bouquet were orchids,
camellias and azaleas. The bride’s three
sisters, Mrs. T. M. Bolland, Deborah and
Judith Staughton, and Jean Weatherly
were a quartette of attendants in
autumnal velvets, their hands filled with
the same berries and leaves as those
which wreathed their hair. Rejoicings
were at the Staughton stronghold,
Keayang, after which guests proceeded
to an informal dance at the R.
home, Wooriwyrite, or to other houses
in the district which were running week-
end parties.
The Dudley Bruntons are lucky
enough to possess a cocktail-bar —a
decided asset for a party. The bar, which
has pale-green walls and a golden ceiling
and lots of easy-chairs with glass-catchers
of the requisite sizes, was filled with
amiability one late afternoon last week.
Mrs. Brunton robed herself in dusty-
beige-pink flat crepe, a hint of bustle in
the frills at the back of the skirt. Among
the guests were Mrs. Stuart Brunton and
Gladys Brunton, General Chauvel and
his lady, with Elyne, lan and Edward,
Anne and Joan Falkiner, the Bill
Lemprieres, Mrs. Tom Grantham and
Monica, the Jim Paxtons and the Fred
Gilders.
The Centenary Club held a rally at the
Wentworth as a welcome to Florence
Austral and John Amadio and a God-
speed to the Hennessy lady, who is off
to Sydney and Queensland in quest of
better health and sunshine. Charlotte
Hemming pluckily mounted the plat-
form with the aid of her stick to do
her bit. She spoke of the time when
she taught a youthful Florence Austral
the art of speaking, and recited “When
Florence Sings” and a poem “especially
for John,” at the conclusion of which
he and Madame Austral swept upon the
Wentworth’s platform to plant kisses on
their old friend’s cheek. Dr. Maloney
seconded a vote of thanks in his favorite
red tie and blue muffler.
There was all the fuss and flutter of a
first night about the opening Austral con-
cert. Even the programmes wore festive
covers of crinkle tissue over green or
gold linings, so the fastidious woman
could choose either a foil or a match for
her dress. The diva was robed in ivory
moire velvet, the decolletage dropped to
the waist at the back, the up-to-the-throat
corsage supported by a fold round the
neck. She wore no jewellery but a dia-
mond bracelet, even her golden head be-
ing unadorned. “God Save” happened
at the end and was sung only by
Madame, though John Amadio made
encouraging gestures at the audience,
inviting co-operation. He and Raymond
Lambert were handed exciting-looking
parcels, and Madame’s floral offerings
kept five ushers running up and down.
Lady Huntingfield was near enough to
the steam-pipes to discard her wrap and
disclose a fashionable back to her Bur-
gundy satin. Also in the v.-r. semi-circle
were the Hon. Anne Vanneck, with her
two plaits swinging upon a green velvet
cloak, Hon. Mrs. Helme Pott, Hon.
Gerald Vanneck and Captain Lawrence.
In a gathering representative of many
walks in life were Prof, and Mrs. Ber-
nard Heinze, the Herbert Brookes couple
in its favorite seats, with daughter Jessie
in orange and a green shoulder-whirl, and
Mrs. Alfred Deakin, Dr. Maurice Mac-
Gillicuddy with his all-in-lilac Mauri-
cette, Dr. John Dale, Theodore Fink,
Basil Murphy, Edouard Lambert, Frank
Talbot and artist Jorgensen of the beard
and long chestnut locks. Mr. and Mrs.
Tom Smith brought their two grand-
children, whose mother, Mrs. Norman
Gadsden, is still abroad.
Athol Shmith has caught Nancy Fry-
berg in serious mood —possibly she is
thinking of the hard work that lies ahead
of her. At last her ambitions are to be
realised, for at the end of the year she
is off to have her dramatic soprano
polished abroad. Should this Melbourne
singer relinquish her present plan of go-
ing to London, Emilio Rossi’s roof is
waiting to shelter her in Milan. Miss
Fry berg’s alma mater was St. Michael’s,
where she distinguished herself as a swim-
mer. Since her schooldays she has been
lab. assistant to Dr. Cherry, Director of
Cancer Research. (Prof. Cherry is his
son.) The Jewish Women’s Association
interests her, and for some time she
reigned as vice-president of its junior
section.
For her concert in Central Hall Miss
Fry berg was swathed in black velvet with
silver-lined flower frivolities upon its
shoulders. Phillip Cohen assisted with
his fiddle, and Henri Penn, after he had
objected in dumb-show to the lighting,
was piano soloist. With her baton
Madame Ottlee marshalled the Southern
Choral Society into white dresses and
white ties for groups by Elgar and
Dvorak and, with Miss Fryberg as solo-
ist, “The Marvellous Work,” by Haydn.
Adelaide’s social annals:
There was a plentiful scattering of blues at
fvi A;, • races. Mrs. F. A. Tennant wore a
Lido-blue ensemble with a hat to match and a
huge white fox fur. Mrs. Pat Hennessey looked
well in a delphinium-hued cloth coat and a felt
hat to tone. Mrs. W. T. Mortlock chose a bur-
gundy-toned marocain coat and skirt, with a
hat to match and a fur of silver fox. The
weather was wintry and fur coats were much
in evidence. Mrs. Alan McFarlane, who had
the thrill of seeing her husband’s horse
Aloxite win the Alderman Cup, wore a hand-
some coat of Persian lamb, with high-standing
collar of mink fur, and a wide-brimmed black
velvet hat.
Ruth Naylor, who is singing the role of
Musetta in La Boheme” at Covent Garden,
London, is a Henley Beach (S.A.) product. She
studied at Adelaide Con. under Clive Carey.
The West enjoys itself:
Perth Repertory Club’s ball was a rosy
attair. Garlands of the blooms trailed over
Government House ballroom’s white walls, all
the pillars were entwined and festoons dangled
in the alcoves. President Rabbi Freedman and
vice-pi esidents Cameron and Bickford stood
at the portals with their better halves, Mrs.
Cameron swathed voluminously with classic
te ins an d Mrs. Bickford draping black
Chantilhes over magenta charmeuse. It was
a Jancy headdress stunt with silvery-white-
wigged Mrs. Ambrose, silver-lame-and-black-
satined Mrs. Langlois Lefroy and Mr. Stan
I erry as the judges. Mollie Learmonth’s gold
and sdver sequinned butterfly winged a prize,
Mable Teather’s lobster mayonnaise clawed
some of the booty, Mrs. R. J. Cox brayed
with glee from her donkey’s head and Miss P.
dicer s, whooped Red Indian
At the W.A.T.C.’s winter meeting a couple of
races were lost to sight through the driving
ram, and a cheery scarf or hat here and there
were the only things to brighten the landscape.
The Moulden lady braved the elements in
navy blues warmed with brown fox furs: a
black seal met its death to cover Mrs. A. M.
Aylwin’s black wool rep.; Mrs. Harry Vin-
cent’s royal-blue tweeds gladdened the eye, as
did Hope Robertson’s leopard collar. Cap-
tain and Mrs. Laurie were there, the Charlie
Heppingstones, Frank Cadd and daughter
Gwen, the Jim Monteiths, the Ernie Halls and
the Everetts, Mr. and Mrs. Lesley and Joan.
At the Dentists’ Ball Mrs. Gilbert Henderson
wore sapphire matelasse emerging from a silver
monkey jacket; Mrs. Tom Flintoff fluttered
geranium petals over her black ninons; Mrs.
Tebbut’s sherry radio-wave velvets were se.en
near daughter Gwenyth’s chromium-plated
black; May Cotterell’s matelasse was in
candied and liquid honey; Betty Holgate
ruched her turquoise laces with taffeta and
Freda Janes scintillated with silver sequins.
Radio station 6AM (sounds like a very early
bird) opened with Lieut.-Governor Mitchell
speaking over the mike from the studio in
Perth, followed by a concert and dance in
the Northam Town Hall. Director Frank
Whitford squired his lady’s black chiffons,
Mrs. Stan Perry sprinkled autumn flowers on
snowy ninon; engineer Coxon’s other half
semi-concealed black georgette with a velvet
coat and Kath Essler swung orange goffered
frills on figured brown flamisol. The gather-
ing in the Mayor’s parlor saw Mrs. Northey’s
welcoming hand extended from scarlet-touched
beige marocains.
Members of the Historical Society donned
their old-world gear and gathered at the Karra-
katta Club on Anniversary night. Mrs. I.
Birtwistle and David Lyle trilled ditties of long
ago and Linley Wilson’s pupils stepped a
graceful minuet during lulls in the old-time
dancing. Meda Leschen, who became Mrs.
Benjamin Clifton next day, was officially wel-
comed into the family by joining in a set of
lancers danced by descendants of Marshall
Waller Clifton, of Australind.
Helen Walker announced her engagement
and exchanged vows with David Williams
within a week. A round of parties was hastily
put on in her honor, with sister Mollie
Walker’s cocktail-shaking as the final shivoo.
The Speck tunes in:
For the racing at Elwick the weather was
fine and the sport exciting. Chairman A. J.
Miller and his wife entertained a big crowd at
tea in the committee-room, Mrs. Miller sport-
ing navy with a pale pink satin vest. Dressing
was wintry. One or two halo-hats looked nice
on the right style of wearers.
The Tas. Institute of Engineers had an even-
ing of merriment at the Imperial. Chairman
and Mrs. P. C. Piper received the guests, the
lady in black ring velvet touched with silver
lame. Supper tables were decorated with gold
hoops set on stands, from which hung trailers
of Virginia creeper and autumn flowers. Lieut.-
Gov. Lewis and his lady were there; also Mayor
and Mayoress Wignall.
Mrs. Payne was hostess at a party at the
Queen Mary to welcome Mrs. D’Arcy Addison
back to the Speck and to speed Mrs. G. H.
Butler and Miss Butler on their way to Eng-
land. Mrs. Payne’s artistic fingers had been
busy making a record of the club’s origin in
1910, the names of the first founders printed
in old English letters, and the whole framed
in a carved setting of old cedar.
Launceston’s Pageant of Song Ball, under the
management of Broadland House School, filled
the big spaces in the Albert Hall with color
and movement. Mrs. H. E. Dougharty deserved
all the bouquets showered on her for the
arrangement of the bright spectacle. His Ex.
and Lady Clark, the latter in deep violet lace,
attended.
The Speck lost a grand old woman when
Mrs. Henry Dobson passed over. Her hus-
band was Premier of this island from ’92 to
’94 and a Senator for nine years to 1910. Mrs.
Dobson was president of the N.C.W. for a
number of years, and many times represented
that body at conferences of the International
Council. She was appointed by the Deakin
Ministry to represent Australia at the Inter-
national Women’s Suffrage Convention at
Amsterdam, and, in all, made 33 visits to Eng-
land and the Continent. The call came at
the 92nd milestone.
We Tasmanians have no use for women in
politics. When 20,888 votes had been counted
in Denison, Mrs. Murdoch’s score was only
119. The courageous lady will lose her
deposit.
To be published soon is “Lyrics and
Sonnets,” by Helen Power, of Hobart, whose
poems have from time to time appeared in
The Bulletin, and also in anthologies.

19 34 FORD
The New Ford V-8 for 1934 is now on display at the showrooms of Ford
Dealers. Surpassing even the great Ford of 1933 in economy, beauty and
comfort, it is truly the car of this modern age —the culmination of 30
years ’ Ford progress. It combines the proved performance of the V-8
cylinder engine with many important new features —Dual carburettor
and Dual Intake Manifold. Perfected clear vision ventilation ....
Matched interiors .... See it and Drive it at the first opportunity .
Distinctive New Appearance . . . .
Appearance is enhanced by newly designed radiator grille, hood louvres and hub
caps. Closed cars have attractive matched interiors blending with body colour;
new window mouldings; new domed-type head lining; new instrument panel;
front seat arm rests. Swivel-type sun visors in De Luxe bodies. All models
have safety glass windscreens.
Better Performance
Greater power, more speed, quicker acceleration, smoother performance, more
miles f>er gallon, especially at higher speeds, and quicker starting in cold weather
all these result from the new dual carburettor and dual intake manifold.
Added engine refinements reduce maintenance costs, further improve operating
economy and reduce oil consumption.
Greater Riding Comfort
Exclusive Ford transverse cantilever type springs have great flexibility, giving
unusual riding comfort. Road shocks are absorbed at outer flexible ends of
springs. Seat cushions are deeper, with new, softer springs. Adding to comfort
is the new driving ease of the 15-to-l steering gear ratio.

“El V.”: “Sydney Herald” has dis-
covered that Jane Austen was “an
authoress of the early eighteenth century,
and a very proper authoress withal:
As a contrast to other noted literary
women of those days (I write of about
1780), Jane Austen’s love episodes were
almost infinitesimal.
I am glad to have that assurance, because
I have always liked Jane, and, though I
do hot mind hearing that Granny
“Herald” in her wild youth had love
episodes when she was five years old (as
Jane was in 1780), I shouldn’t like to
hear of any really nice authoress of my
acquaintance being so precocious.

“Doggie”: Admiral Roger Keyes, in
his recently-published reminiscences, tells
a navy yarn that seems fresher than most.
In August, 1914, the German Ambassa-
dor and his staff were embarked for the
Hook of Holland on one of the Great
Eastern Railway’s passenger packets.
Going out of Harwich, the skipper noted
that the German naval attache and one
or two others were interested in his
course ; he thereupon zigzagged his ship
all over the place for half an hour. His
passengers landed in Holland convinced
that Britain had laid an elaborate mine-
field outside Harwich —where nothing of
the kind then existed.

They’re never too old to appear in
the Divorce Court. Earl Russell —better
known as Bertrand Russell, the philo-
sopher-mathematician—whose Countess
has served him with a citation, is 62.
The Countess’s father, Sir Frederick Black,
was a police magistrate in Ceylon before
the war, and in that capacity was liked
by many Australians who met him at the
club on the Maidan. Earl Russell’s late
brother, to whose title the present peer
succeeded, married at the third attempt
(he divorced his first wife, and his: second
divorced him) Mary Beauchamp, the
famous native of M.L. and relation of
Sydney’s Lasseter family who wrote
“Elizabeth and Her German Garden.”

Fritz Hart has an impish sense of
humor. Welcomed to Melbourne from
his third visit to Honolulu, he touched
on the difficulties of training an orchestra
whose members represented nine pure
nations and an indeterminate number of
mixtures. “In the beginning,” he said
with a grin, “they were as responsive
as a lot of elderly virgins.” Mrs. Hart
and Lillian Stott gave a recital in Hono-
lulu, after which the newspaper critics re-
proached them for not having prepared
them for the “most marvellous and
stupendous singer of the age.” In Hono-
lulu nothing less than a long string of
superlatives serves to describe a vocalist
who knows her job.

“Jolland”: The late Thomas Anstey
Guthrie (“F. Anstey”) sold “Vice Versa”
for £5O. The publishers paid him a few
hundreds more after the success of the
book and its author was assured, but
they were under no obligation to do so,
having bought the copyright straightout.
Perhaps the most amazing thing about
the transaction is that Anstey, who was
not absolutely dependent on his pen for
a living, should have accepted such a
beggarly sum. But the reason is fairly
obvious; the book had been turned
down by six firms of booksellers. Pub-
lishers, one can’t help thinking, must
have had some hopelessly inefficient
readers when the delicious humor and
irresistible drollery of “Vice Versa” could
go undiscerned.

“Ex-P.8.1.”: I saw a Brjtish 18-
pounder battery bring down a low-flying
two-seater German aeroplane at Ypres
in September, 1918. Fritz had been over
after some of our kite balloons, missed
them, and was going home flat out,
machine-gunning ground targets and gen-
erally making it the end of a perfect day.
The officers of the battery—one of the
41st Divisional Artillery—saw him com-
ing and raced for the gun-pits. It was
seen that the ’plane would pass almost
directly over the battery position, about
400 ft. to 500 ft. up. Two guns were hur-
riedly laid on the probable course, and
at the right moment fired. One shell-
shrapnel—burst just above the tail ,of
the ’plane ; the pilot and observer were
literally riddled with bullets, and the
’plane crashed by the White Chateau, on
the Menin-road. The O.C. battery was
a well-known Cape Town solicitor, Major
Roper.

“Pawang”: I have often wondered
where influenza comes from. The latest
theory is that of Dr. Howard Wise, who
contributes his discovery to the British
“Medical Journal” ; it is that ’flu has its
origin in the mud of the Yellow River.
The mud is infected with bacilli, and in
the periodical great floods is deposited
over the surrounding landscape ; when it
dries the dust is distributed over the
membranes of the people. Dr. Wise
points to the fact that widespread
epidemics followed floods in 1899 and
1913. The infection was first carried to
Europe via the land routes, but now
takes the sea way. According to Dr.
Wise, the next overflowing is due in
1946, and will be followed by another
epidemic unless the Whang Hoo is dealt
with. As it is capable of inundating a
small continent when it gets down to
business, this seems a tough proposition.
* * * *
“Old Liner”: One of the drawbacks
of civilising the Pacific island native is
that it inevitably draws him away from
his old habits and social culture. Dr.
Bach, R.C. Bishop of the Gilbert
Islands, made this clear recently. He
mentioned that the Gilbert atolls were
passing through the world depression,
due to the impossible copra prices. In
happier days the people earned enough
of the white man’s food to live in com-
fort. Rice in abundance, tinned salmon
and other delectable imported foods
taught the natives to forget the cocoa-
nuts and fish which, before the white
man’s coming, were their only food.
Now after many years the Gilbertians
have had to go back to the old kai. It
sits sourly on their stomachs, and every-
one who knows the Gilberts can vouch
that, even when there is plenty of both,
fish and cocoanuts pall on the hungriest.

“Two Spades”: England is to see an-
other exhibition of freak golf. George

12 handicap man, and is to try his luck

“Shrewsbury”: Oxford’s supporters
have hopes that the long run of losses
in the boatrace with Cambridge will be
broken next year. For some reason not
disclosed, Peter Haig Thomas, who
coached Cambridge for its 11 successive
wins, has parted brass-rags with the
Light Blues, and will take the Oxford
crew in hand for next year’s race. A
lot of people have been wondering how
it is the Cambridge crews have been so
uniformly successful. “Peter Haig
Thomas” seems to be the correct answer.

“Spinnaker”: Sopwith’s cutter Endea-
vour, the 15th challenger for the R.Y.S.
cup, won by the Yankee schooner
America in 1851 and kept on the other
side of the herring pond ever since, has
been successful in its first race. The
Americans are building a new yacht
named Rainbow, and she is to be sent
out in a series of trials with Yankee and
Weetamoe, which are now being altered
to the new specifications for the purpose.
Endeavour is slightly the larger, which
means she must give a time allowance in
the seven races which are to decide the
issue. Comparative measurements are:
Endeavour, 128 ft. overall; Rainbow,
126.57 ft.; waterline 83ft. and 82ft., beam
22ft. and 20.92 ft., draught 15ft. and
14.93 ft., sail area 7550 ft. and 7555 ft.
Endeavour’s weight is not given, but the
American’s is 138.137 tons.

“Amateur Pro.”: Rene Lacoste, who
learned his tennis off his own racquet, so
to speak, is dead against the modern
idea of dry-nursing and mollycoddling
young players in the hope that one or
two of them will develop into champions.
Says Lacoste, “Certain tennis-players who
are only ‘hopes’ would be already cham-
pions, perhaps, if they had been less
aided materially—if the easygoing life
they had been induced to lead had not
retarded to a certain extent their intel-
lectual and moral development.”

“Over 40 ailments are caused
by clogged intestines,” ex-
plains Dr. J. Bruenaur, the
noted European Specialist.
Constipation, ind i g e stion,
stomach troubles, gastritis
rheumatism, neuritis, sciatica
—• bladder weakness, catarrh,
frequent colds, headaches
lassitude and poor appetite
all these and more can be
caused by the clogging of the
intestines which gives rise to
Self-poisoning ( Autoxima).
NEARLY EVERYONE SUFFERS
Self-poisoning is caused through
incomplete evacuation of the
bowels. Nearly everyone suffers,
even people of regular habits.
Modern foods and lack of exercise
give rise to flabbiness of the ab-
dominal organs which makes com-
plete elimination almost impos-
sible. Fragments of food waste
cling to the intestinal walls and'
there decay, breeding germs and
poisons which enter the blood-
stream. Self-poisoning is all the
more to be dreaded because it is
hidden and often unsuspected'. The
symptoms of self-poisoning are
always apparent, however. Skin
blemishes, those frequent head-
aches, fits of ‘blues/ the strange
lassitude and weakness which pre-
vent you from entering fully into
the enjoyment of life all point to
you being a victim.
Poisons from sluggish intestines spread
throughout the body and undermine
health, prominent physicians explain.
COLOSEPTIC combats ill-health by
activating the entire intestinal truct.
O
Here's where 95% of
present-day ill-health be-
gins. Keep clean intern-
ally by daily drinking
COLOSEPTIC.
“EQUAL TO 15 YEARS OF LIFE”
“I have been using COLOSEPTIC
for over three years. I have felt
very grateful to it as it effected a
wonderful difference in health and
strength, equal to a recovery of 15
years of life. I became absolutely
free of any physical complaint
whatever. I am 83 years of age and
my health continues perfect and
free from any trouble. I now
find it only expedient to take
COLOSEPTIC occasionally of a
morning.”

COLOSEPTIC BRINGS BACK
HEALTH
Before you fan regain the spark-
ling health that is your birthright,
you must sweep away the poison-
ous intestinal accumulations. Drink
COLOSEPTIC in hot water every
morning. Coloseptic first loosens
the fermenting matter encrusted on
the walls of the intestines and then
gently sweeps it right out of the
body. COLOSEPTIC activates the
kidneys, the pores of the skin, and
the respiratory apparatus, thereby
ridding the blood-stream of all
impurities.
DRINK COLOSEPTIC EVERY
MORNING
COLOSEPTIC gives you the in-
ternal cleansing which is the first
step to perfect health. And with
the body internally clean how well
you feel. Gone are the aches and
pains, the feeling of being old be-
fore your time. You regain the
vim and vigour of youth, your step
is firm, eyes sparkle, you are a new
being alive to all the pleasures
that life can offer.
TEST COLOSEPTIC FOR
YOURSELF
Don’t let the ill-health, so sympto-
matic of self-poisoning, drag at
you any longer. COLOSEPTIC in

Down the Well.
BY G. F. WALKER.
SMOKE from a fire on the range was
creeping through the trees around as
Jack Kemp scraped a hole in the
ground with his rabbiter’s hoe and re-
set a rabbit-trap, while Bill Lonergan held
two saddle-horses alongside and rolled
one of his eternal cigarettes.
Low over the hills to the north-west
the sun, clear-cut as a full moon, but
red as a poisoned eye, was setting in a
pall of smoke. A smoke-mauvey twilight
was filling the long, partly cleared valley
that wound through timbered hills to the
distant Alps.
Weeks of hot weather had parched the
winter-torrent beds along the valley, had
bleached the long grass by the water-runs
to a tinder dryness and had dimmed the
green of the flanking timber with dusty,
coppery tints. Lonergan, watching the
pillar of smoke from the fire, was pon-
dering its possible danger. It was safe
if the wind stayed down, he guessed.
Kemp straightened from his trap-set-
ling, wiping dusty hands across the sides
of dustier trousers.
“If these traps don’t get the dingo, that
fire might do for it, eh?” he said.
“Yes,” answered Lonergan ; “and if
a wind springs up it might do for us, too,
and all the sheep the dingo’s been feedin’
on.”
“Good luck we’ve got the well along-
side the shack to hop into,” said Kemp.
“That fire could whip down to the mouth
of the valley and lock us in proper.”
The men mounted, and, as they rode
over a timbered spur for the home clear-
ing at the mouth of the valley, Lonergan
mused bitterly over the depredations of
a dingo that, for a fortnight, had been
raiding their sheep nightly. Each night
a dozen or so sheep had been killed or
so badly maimed that they had to be
destroyed. Just when he and Kemp were
beginning to show a profit with the new
prices, after years of poor returns.
There wasn’t a darned thing more they
could do to get the brute, he told him-
self. They were hunting it every day*
watching at night and losing sleep, and
setting all the traps they had evening
after evening. And they hadn’t even
had a smell of it.
Rumley, their neighbor over on the
Billikoo run, had done too much. He
had laid poison-baits. Two nights back
their sheep-dog, Betsy, had crawled home
retching convulsively, with one of Rum-
ley’s baits inside her. Lonergan winced
as he recalled Betsy’s awful agony. He
had drenched her with an emetic, but she
died. Another kill to the dingo! He
would just as soon have lost half the
sheep.
“If I could only get my hands on the
thing!” he muttered.
Kemp paid no attention to the remark.
He had heard it a hundred times in the
last fortnight. He was always reiterating
it himself.
The men reached the clearing where
their hut stood. It looked very homely
after the heat of the day, with its score
of straggling fruit-trees and its row of
Lombardy poplars running down to a
well, their light foliage showing out
blithely against the sombre gums of the
slope across the valley. An English
family had settled there originally.
Lonergan and Kemp had finished tea
and it was dark outside, and through
their window they could see the flames
of the bushfire, backed by a glow that
spread to the zenith. Kemp was on his
bunk, worrying over the dingo. Loner-
gan, with the butt of one cigarette in his
mouth, was rolling another.
A rustle in the massy plum-tree out-
side the door made Lonergan tauten.
The walls of the hut trembled and a ball
of tossed-out paper scuttered over the
ground outside.
A wind was rising. Lonergan strode
to the door, Kemp on his heels. As
Lonergan pulled the door open a gust
of wind shot in like an attack. He
gripped Kent’s arm. The wind, increas-
ing in rapid gusts, was blowing from
behind the fire.
A roar swept down from the blaze,
now suddenly raging in a mad fury and
racing down to the mouth of the valley.
Lonergan saw at once that it would
swiftly seal them in and storm over the
clearing.
“It means the well, Jack!” he ex-
claimed grimly. “Shove everything you
can into the well and I’ll free the horses.
They’ll have a chance of getting away up
the Valley.”
As Lonergan ran to the horse paddock
sparks were showering down from the
fire and lighting the timber near the edge
of the clearing. The main blaze raged
down behind.
The horses, stiffened with growing fear,
were standing near the sliprails, Loner-
gan flung the rails down and yelled be-
hind the horses, but they galloped round
and round the paddock —for ages it
seemed to Lonergan —before they broke
through the gap and wheeled up the
valley.
Like a hand-smack Lonergan felt the
hot breath of the conflagration on his
cheek as he turned for the hut. In the
fierce glare that lit the valley he could
see Kemp, blurred by smoke, struggling
towards the well with what looked like
a bed.
Lonergan dashed into the hut. Kemp
had pretty well stripped it of its scant
furnishings. As Lonergan yanked a box
of private belongings from a shelf, Kemp
rushed inside shouting wildly for him.
A savage din of blazing foliage and
crashing timber nearly drowned his voice.
Tossing arms of flame enveloped the
whole.hillside in front of them, and the
fruit-trees were blazing as the men ran
outside. They loaded themselves with
their saddles and bridles as the last bit
of salvage and raced to the well.
“The rope's 0.K.!” yelled Kemp. He
slid down the rope which had been left
hanging down the well as a fire-escape.
Lonergan followed.
Edges of the hut’s furniture showed
'over the red-shot surface of the well-
water. Lonergan pulled a suitcase away
and lay, half submerged, in a trough be-
tween a slanted table-top and a meatsafe.
Kemp, under water to the waist, huddled
on a gradually subsiding pile of bedding.
A vivid, weaving glow lit up one side of
the well. The other, where the men were
crouched, was dimmed by a shadow
thrown by the lip of the well.
Into the lurid circle over their heads
popped the snout of an animal, slavering
with fear and exertion. A head dropped
over the lip of the well, and Lonergan
and Kemp caught a glimpse of terrified
eyes as a tawny brute tumbled down into
the water. A yellowish, pointed head re-
appeared, then flashed from sight again
as the creature splashed and struggled.
Its groping paws gripped a submerged
object, and it stopped plunging, although
its back legs kept sliding away. Only
its head and shoulders showed —a gro-
tesque shape in the wavering glow—but
Lonergan guessed at once the identity of
this new refugee.
“Hell, Jack! The dingo! ”he exclaimed.
Kemp gaped in amazement. “Must
have been caught out on its raid,” said
Lonergan.
The dingo, aware of the men for the
first time, jerked round its head, its
dripping jaws shot back and white fangs
flashed ; not in a snarl, but in a new
shock of terror. It slid from its support,
scrambled back on it again, and cowered
whimpering.
Blasts of hot air and smoke howled
down into the well. It was warming up
like an oven. A sudden fierce crackling
outroared the din above. “That’s the
poplars,” said Lonergan, his voice
strangely subdued by the presence of the
dingo.
“Look! The dam’ dingo’s been
burned,” exclaimed Kemp. Blackened
flesh showed through its yellow shoul-
ders. The men saw that burning leaves
and twigs that had been swirling into the
well were settling on it.

The “Cyclone” label on your roll of fencing is your definite guarantee that
you have bought the very strongest fencing that is made. It means that your
fencing 'will be absolutely stockproof, practically everlasting, and completely
free of costs for maintenance or repairs. Here are two simple tests that prove
your wisdom in ordering “Cyclone” Ringlock.
Test No. i
THE “RESILIENCE TEST” (see sketch and arrows). After straining
to the correct tension, grasp the top and bottom wires firmly, and bend
them towards each other, forcing the top wire down and the bottom wire up.
You won't be able to make much impression on a “Cyclone” Ringlock
fence, because the upright wires are so strong and resilient that when you
let it go it will spring back to its original position without distortion.
“Cyclone” Ringlock is the fence with backbone ; only HARD steel wire
is used throughout.
Test No. 2
THE “JOINT TEST.”—Grasp an upright wire above and below a joint
(see sketch), then wrench the upright
first one way and then the other.
You’ll never shift the Ringlock joint.
It’s rigid and immovable. “Cyclone”
Ringlock is the ONLY fence made
throughout of HARD steel wire. It is
absolutely unaffected by weather ; the
longer the fence is erected the tighter
the joints become.
There is the correct type of “Cyclone”
Ringlock for every class of fencing (sheep,
lambs, cattle, horses, pigs). For paddock
subdivision —whether temporary or per-
manent —“Cyclone” Ringlock fence stands
alone.
“ CYCLONE ” is not a “type" offence, but
is our registered trade mark, and can only be
legally applied to fencing manufactured by us.

Lonergan splashed water over the dog.
It cringed away, lost its foothold, tussled
madly and secured another, where it was
jammed against the side of the well.
A crash broke in on the roar above,
“The roof of the hut,” commented Kemp,
Lonergan hardly heard the noise. He
was watching the dingo, gripped by the
drama of such unexpected propinquity,
The dingo looked a craven thing, whim-
pering and trembling, its muddied amber
eyes distended with terror, its tongue
drooling, and a wildly wavering shadow,
wolfish in outline, behind it. Lonergan
felt a strong surge of pity. Very much
like a domestic dog it looked—a bit like
Betsy, he thought. But it was a cur and
an outlaw, and something to be killed, or
it would ruin you.
He thought of the torn, bleeding sheep,
and of Betsy, and his pity died. But
the dingo was whining poignantly and
his pity rose again. There was a bond
between them now, anyway! They were
all hunted creatures when it came to
bushfires. What a damn twisted joke
some demon had played, his thought ran,
to produce in a moment the killer that
he and Kemp had vainly hunted for days,
to put it completely at their mercy;
and yet, instead of wanting to kill it on
sight, he could feel only pity for it!
The bedding on which Kemp was
perched collapsed and he floundered
wildly. “Grab this! ” commanded Loner-
gan, thrusting out his hand.
The disturbance heaped a fresh terror
on the dingo. It howled hideously, and
a blatter of re-echoing noise filled the
well. Startled once more from its foot-
hold, it whirled madly around and over
its previous position, too distraught to
climb back again. Its outcry changed
every second or two to silly-sounding
gurgles as its head went underwater.
“The poor devil! It’ll drown,” said
Lonergan. He grabbed the dingo by the
ear and dragged it to him. The dingo
burst into another shattering howl, fought
to free itself and snapped viciously at
Lonergan’s wrist.
He clamped his other hand over the
dingo’s snout, pulled the creature up from
the water and bundled it on to the top
of the meatsafe behind him, where he
closed his free arm around it and held
it down, keeping clear of its burns.
A new intensity in the roar of the fire
indicated that it was across the clearing
and was burning into the timber on the
other side.
“We can get out now, I reckon,” said
Kemp. He pulled himself up the rope,
swore as he burnt his hand on the hot
brickwork of the lip of the well, and
poked his head over the top.
The main fire had passed, and he
tumbled out, his hands plunged in his
sodden coat-pockets. Lonergan, with-
drawing gingerly from the dingo, climbed
out after him.
The trunks of the poplars glimmered
and smouldered like stubbed torches.
The chimney of the hut, a mass of smok-
ing rubbish round its base, stood out
pallid as a nude beauty. Scavenging run-
nels of flame licked up grass that the
blaze had left, and smoke from mounds
of ruin around the clearing rose in wind-
swirled waves.
The fire crackled and roared through
the timber across the clearing, and a glare
still lit up the night. On the hillside down
which it had blazed to the clearing,
smouldering tree-trunks glowed pulsingly
in the wind.
As Public Enemy No. 1, Lonergan and
Kemp killed the dingo. They lugged it
out of the well with a noosed rope, and
Lonergan shot it in the glare of the fire
as soon as he had retrieved his rifle and
some bullets.
“We’re lucky to have it served up to
us like this, after all the time we hunted
it,” said Lonergan. “And it evens up
with Betsy. But, hell! It wouldn’t take
much to make me let the poor devil go,”
he finished wryly.
“Me either,” said Kemp as the dingo,
trussed up, cowered before Lonergan’s
rifle. “But go on, shoot!”
No More Illusions.
BY JOHN ANDREWS.
A SMALL man, red-faced and pale-
eyed, appeared beside me when I
upset my glass. 1 had been yarning
with Myrtle across the bar.
“No woman is worth it,” he observed.
“There wasn’t much in the glass,” I
said.
“It’s not that altogether,” he went on ;
“I mean the time a man wastes on ’em.
Time and trouble. What does he get for
it? A shadowy illusion of happiness,
largely self-sustained at that.”
“You have lost many an illusion, I
can see.”
“Unfortunately,” he admitted. “Re-
member, to lose an illusion is to lose
something more perfect than the reality.
Thank you. A small lager, please.”
“Years ago,” he resumed, “when I was
young and knew next to nothing, I was
spending a holiday in Boolgaroolga. My
host had taken me to a bush dance ; I
had inadvertently shot his favorite dog
that day. Half the evening had dragged
by slowly when I met Yvonne.
“Aesthetically, the polka-mazurka had
always left me cold. But she danced with
a sylph-like grace that was the very poetry
of motion. In her talk I recognised a
charm of mind that even Boolgaroolga
hadn’t corrupted. ;
“She was the publican’s daughter.
Horace Sywimbleton, the oily-haired
M.C., was seeing her home. The whole
thing was plain as a pikestaff. Inexperi-
enced as she was, he had found it easy
to impose himself on her.
“I left her later with a promise that
we’d meet by the bridge outside the town-
ship the next evening. Later still, I left
Sywimbleton with a scar that has lasted
to the present day. See, just behind this
ear.
“It made little difference. Many a time
Yvonne and I met among the willows by
the bridge and, when the weather was
unpropitious, in the scented dusk of her
father’s cellar.
“Before long, I was aware of a certain
warmth of feeling on her part. For my
own —well, what would you expect?
“My holiday came to an end. I had
turned over the idea of an elopement, but
I knew that my family would disapprove.
That last evening down by the bridge we
pledged each other in a bottle of her
father’s filthy hock to wait years if neces-
sary.
“In the following months I wrote her
endless letters, garlanded with endear-
ments. The blow fell with crushing
suddenness. Somehow, this Horace
Sywimbleton had prevailed upon her
tender sympathies and married her!”
For a space the little man gazed sadly
into his glass.
“I’ll bet you felt bad,” I ventured as
Myrtle reappeared. “The same?”
He nodded.
“How can I describe my feelings at
the time? I have forgotten them myself.
To some, young love is as ephemeral as
a politician’s promises. With me it went
deeper. I was forced to turn to work
for forgetfulness. I entered the legal
firm of Wibley, Wibley, Wibley and
Wibley, in which I became a partner as
the Wibleys thinned out.
“For years women had no interest for
me. I found none to compare with
Yvonne of Boolgaroolga. But in time
my discrimination dulled. I married a
woman whose walk reminded me of hers.
“It was a tragedy from the start.
Imagine the W.C.T.U. co-operating with
the Brewery Union’s Picnic Committee
and you have a faint idea of how it was
with us.
“I had weathered her first season's
golf. I had shown her how to tell the
gear-shift from the hand-brake on the
car, but when she demanded that I teach
her contract bridge I said to myself:
‘Edgar, old man, it’s time to look up
Whilper on “Matrimonial Causes.” ’ I
was worn to a shadow.
“I lunched at Ramsbotham’s then. It
was the one bright spot in my day.
“On one occasion a meatier joke than
usual was told among us regulars. The
waiter bore down on us during the
applause.
“ ‘A lady over there,’ he says to me,
‘says will you please speak up. She
couldn’t catch what the Frenchman said
to the duchess.’
“In the hush that fell, I glanced across
the room. It was Yvonne!
“I went straight over and, apologising
for the others, mentioned my name. She
was astounded.
“ ‘My heart-line indicated this,’ she
said when she got over the shock. I
looked blank. ‘I go in for palmistry a
little,’ she explained.
“She was the same shy girl. In a more
mature way, I mean. It seemed like
yesterday that we had met among the
empties behind the Boolgaroolga Arms.
We were soon deep in reminiscence.
Presently I worked the conversation
around to palmistry. I hinted at my un-
happy life. My faith in womankind

’""THERE is no greater obstacle to social

revived as she listened. Here, at last, was
a woman who was no kitchen shrew.
“Just then Wibley butted in. He
approached our table spluttering with
rage and waving his watch at me. I
drew his attention to Yvonne. He
apologised and mumbled something about
missing his lunch. He’d been waiting, of
course, for me to relieve him.
“When I suggested that Yvonne should
come to the office the next afternoon, she
readily agreed. I was delighted, and
Wibley said he was looking forward to
having his fortune told. For impudent
effrontery it took the cake.
“In the following weeks her visits
became looked-for events. . I kept her
away from my partner as much as I
could. Wibley could do much to dis-
credit one if one is judged by one’s com-
pany. She was impressed by the wealth
and distinction of our clients. I intro-
duced her to several.. They were cap-
tivated by her charm.
“Once I found Wibley deep in con-
versation with her. I knew that, given
a chance, he would pour out his troubles
to anyone. Mrs. Wibley was a jealous
woman. While this commanded my in-
dulgence, I didn’t see why Yvonne should
he burdened with it. ‘Mrs. Sywimble-
lon is interested in our opulent clientele,
old man,’ was his feeble excuse. I gave
her a tip as to his character before she
left.
“Up to this my wife had never troubled
me during business hours. The office was
my one retreat from the hardships of
domesticity.
“Then one afternoon Yvonne took my
hand when I was helping her to after-
noon-tea. ‘You have an interesting head-
line,’ she told me. ‘But remember the
price of perspicacity is pain. 1 see you
will get some sudden shocks.’
“I got the first one right then. My
wife walked in!
“I explained hurriedly. ‘This is
Yvonne. Mrs. Yvonne —a friend of Mr.
Wibley.’
“Opening Wibley’s door, I called out
‘Oh, there you are, Wibley. A lady to
see you, old man.’
“When we were alone my wife didn’t
voice her suspicions bluntly. A complete
command of innuendo has always been
hers. Even then I was getting the situa-
tion in hand, when Wibley played me as
foul a trick as one man can play another.
“His door flew open. Literally thrust-
ing Yvonne in front of him, he called
out:
“ ‘A—a lady to see you, old man! ’
“I glimpsed my wife’s face. With
Yvonne before me, I flung his door open
again and said loudly: ‘lf this is your
idea of a joke, Wibley, I fail to see it.
This lady is a friend of yours.’
“I glanced around his room, and for
the moment I was thunderstruck. There
stood Mrs. Wibley!
“Obviously she had caught him making
his odious advances to Yvonne. He kept
mumbling ‘She’s yours! You know she’s
yours, old man.’ I forget what argu-
ments I used. Faintly I remember Wibley
passing Yvonne backwards and forwards
in the doorway. It was ghastly.
“My wife spent day and night being a
wronged woman. The most watertight
explanations were useless. To my relief
she left after a week of it, to share her
wrongs with her family.
“Wibley and I never spoke face to face
after that day. We had separate ’phones,
and he would dial my number when the
work necessitated it. Once, I inadvertently
hung up on him. The antipathy between
us deepened after that. We were only
able to work together by leaving notes
on each other’s desks during lunch-hour.
“That was the position when the crash
came. Jacob Schwinghammer was the
first. He called and said that he was
interested in a land speculation. It was
being kept dark at present, and he was
getting in on the ground floor. Would
we realise on his investments with us?
Several of our wealthier clients followed
him with similar requests. That after-
noon it was Gothby-Norman. I could
get no details from any of them.
“The position was delicate. We had
made some investments on our own
initiative, ambitious enough, but ill-
advised, as it turned out. In a word, we
were embarrassed.
‘The next day while Wibley was at
lunch, I wandered about the office worry-
ing things over. I could see no way out.
A steamship folder on Wibley’s desk
caught my eye. ‘Why not escape it all?’
I asked myself.
‘A passport? No, I must just disappear.
It would mean hardship. But wherever
I went I would take with me my memo-
ries of Yvonne.
‘The next afternoon I boarded the
R.M.S. Mauritius.
“It was touch and go. I just managed
to get on board before sailing time. I
reached the boatdeck. They were cast-
ing off as I walked along the long row
of lifeboats. It was high time I found
my accommodation. The cover of each
boat was tied down. All except one,
which was unfastened at one end. There
was no one in sight, so I scrambled up
the side and wriggled under the canvas.
“I sat up in the dim light, when a voice
behind me gave me the shock of my life.
‘So you’ve followed me, you swine!’
“It was Wibley!
“ ‘The cover was the only one untied,'
I tried to tell him.
‘“You followed me!’ he insisted.
“ ‘Look, old man,’ I said, ‘we ? re both
in the same boat in more ways than one
Don’t forget I’ve had my share of woman
trouble. True, for me there will always
be Yvonne.’
“‘What do you mean —for you?’ he
snapped.
“Before l could answer he struck me.
and we fell struggling in the bottom ol
the boat. He had me by the throat, when
I got my hand on a bit of wood. I
brought it down on his head!
“It looked as though I had killed him
Annoyed as I was, I became aware of
an elderly man emerging from some
canvas at the other end of the boat.

North of Capricorn.
I know a glorious place to be,
To rest and dream awhile,
Close to the wide and friendly sea
Where the dusk and the starlight smile,
And the lights of the town in the distant
shine
And the palms and the silence are,
And somebody’s thoughts keep step with min.
As the sea-lights step with a star —
Seeking for wonders yet unborn,
Somewhere up north of Capricorn.
Deep is the hush over sea and land
Where the tides and the river meet;
Even the swift wheels understand
And whisper along the street.
Dim islands loom out in Cleveland Bay;
The port lights flash and turn;
Bold Castle Hill seems far away
By the path which the moonbeams burn—
Reaching to many an isle forlorn,
Somewhere up north of Capricorn.
Where are you now, O dreamer dark?
Your eyes like the dusk were made
To follow in dreams an enchanted barque
Or ghosts in a lovers’ glade.
Where have you gone on this magic night
Who were so near that day?
Have you fled to the stars through a world
made white.
By the moon on Cleveland Bay,
Where the warm winds pass with a breath of
scorn
For a dreamer up north of Capricorn?
I will go back to that shore again
Some day, to the sea-winds warm,
Where the dusk is filled with the hopes of men
And memories sweet that swarm;
Where the sea is still as a sheet of glass,
And in the silence there
You almost hear God’s footsteps pass
To bless a world so fair;
And the moon rides high like a silver horn,
Somewhere up north of Capricorn.

The Unbeliever.
BY CON DREW.
I AIN’T ever told you fellers about that
red-headed Doubtin’ Thomas I
bumped in western Queensland. He
was as unbelievin’ a bird as ever there
was, but if his hair had been any other
color he would have been saved a deal
of unpleasantness.
I was out on the road with a boxin’
booth. There was a couple of welters
who could slide round pretty slick, and
a middle called Keegan who wasn’t too
bad, though you couldn’t have called him
a fighter. But the drawcard was a heavy-
weight we had christened Slugger Ryan
after a scrapper who was makin’ a name
for himself chinnin’ all-comers at the
Sydney Stadium. Our bloke wasn’t a
champ., if you know what I mean, but
he generally skittled the come-ons in
about half a round.
Our layout was a big horse-waggon,
which carried us and the gear, an’ I’d
brought an ex-jockey from Brisbane to
drive it.
We’d lob in a town, set up the tent,
and when the gang was lined up I’d rattle
off a lot of wild stuff that didn’t mean
nothin’. To top off, I’d offer a fiver to
the lad who could stay three rounds with
Slugger.
Slugger skittled his man on time in
every instance, and things looked good
for about a month. Then there came a
slump. And, believe me, it was a slump.
It appeared that the shearin’ season
had started, and most of the sports had
left the district to take on barberin’ the
woollies. You wouldn’t have believed
it possible that a few rancid sheep could
have made such a difference to our busi-
ness. At some of the towns we couldn’t
entice more than a dozen or so into the
web. We was as out of luck as a beef-
bone at a dog show.
I’d heard of a town called Raslin,
which was located some twenty miles
away, and we steered our barque for
there. Whoever said that Raslin was a
good show town knew nothin’. There was
about twenty-five men and a ,score of
kangaroo-dogs in the dump when we
lobbed there. We gave it a pass and went
on to the next town, and that was worse.
Ten days later we pulled in at a town-
ship tucked away in the bend of a river
and pitched our tent on a vacant allot-
ment.
“If this place proves to be a dud,” I
said to Slugger, “we’ll have to pass the
buck. I’m down to my last five notes.”
Well, we opened up that night with,
enough flares around the joint to illumi-
nate the Leanin’ Tower of Babel. A fair-
sized crowd collected; but no one
showed a disposition to come and get
knocked out. Most of them were eatin’
peanuts and exchangin’ information con-
cernin’ sheep. I made them a speech
that would have enticed a corporal’s
guard away from a canteen counter at
noon on a pay-day; but they dug their
toes into the ground and refused to
budge.
There was my boys lined up on the
board and not a blow struck. It was like
tryin’ to peddle diamonds in a dole camp.
“Gents.,” I said at last, “it’s evident
that you have assembled here because
you don’t realise how comfortable you
are at home. If I was runnin’ a sheep
show or a horspital for speckled brum-
bies you’d be playin’ leapfrog with one
another tryin’ to get in; but I ain’t. I
wish you one and all good-night.”
I’m just goin’ to step down off the
stand when someone on the outskirts of
the crowd yells out, “That ain’t Slugger
Ryan.”
“What’s that?” I said, wheeling.
“Oh, you heard what I said,” come
back the bloke.
“H’m,” I says to myself. “It might
be that this bird knows somethin’. I’d
better solind him out.”
“Come up into the light and show
yourself,” I said, beckonin’ him forward.
“I ain’t on the long-distance telephone.”
The bloke edged forward and I seen
that he was a red-headed gent, with ears
like jug-handles. He was a simple-lookin’
bird, and I judged his weight to be about
twelve stone ten. In condition he might
have fined down below twelve.
“That’s better,” I said. “Now we can
see each other without a telescope. What
was that you were tryin’ to tell us?”
“I’m telling you that that bloke there
ain’t Slugger Ryan,” he said, pointin’ to
Slugger.
“Oh, ain’t he?” I snapped. “Maybe
you’ll try to tell us that you’re Slugger
Ryan?”
The crowd laughed at that, and Red-
head colored up.
“No, I ain’t Slugger Ryan,” he said.
“And he ain’t, either.”
“You’re certain of that, eh?”
“Absolute certain.”
“Maybe he’s heard that Slugger is dead
or someone has shown him a schlenter
photo.,” said one of the welters.
“I ain’t heard nothin’ and I ain’t seen
nothin’,” come back Redhead ; “but I
know that ain’t Slugger Ryan. I’ve got a
reason for kno win’.” ''
The crowd laughed again and I held
up my mitt for silence. “Gents,” I said,
“a slur has been cast on the honesty and
rep. of this here show which must not
be let go unchallenged. This gent, here
has publicly stated that my heavyweight
boxer ain’t the genuine Slugger Ryan.
All right. What’s wrong with him step-
pin’ inside and provin’ his words?”
“Aw, I don’t have to prove nothin’,”
Redhead come back. “I’m just sayin’
that he ain’t Slugger Ryan, and no more
he ain’t.”
“And I’m just sayin’ that he is Slugger
Ryan,” I said, skewering him with a look.
“What you say don’t count for nothin’,
because you ain’t game to take a glove
and prove your words.”
“Ain’t I?”
“No, you ain’t. And the chance of
winnin’ a fiver won’t encourage you to
try and prove them, either,” I jeered,
holdin’ out a glove.
“Go on, Bluey,” said two or three
chaps in the crowd. “We’ll see you get
a fair go.”
Redhead still hung back, and Slugger
lets out a laugh.
“Aw, get on with the business,” he
said, “and let him get back under the sink
with the other gaspipes.”
“Don’t call me a gaspipe,” said Red-
head, flushing up.
“Rats!” jeered Slugger. “You’re only
a windbag.”
“I’ll show you whether I’m a windbag
or not,” said Redhead, pushin’ his way
to the Stand. “Throw me them gloves.”
You should have seen us pack ’em in!
Inside k quarter of an hour there wasn’t
room in the tent for a dog to bark.
When. Redhead had peeled down for
business and I was puttin’ on his gloves
it didn’t take no Nick Carter to see that
he was a newchum at the boxin’ game.
He was lookin’ pretty nervous, and
there’s a dozen ways of judgin’ if a man
has had any ring experience.
Thinkin’ to do him a good turn, I said,
“See here, son. If you’ve learned your
boxin’ by post it ain’t too late to juggle
out of this. We can easy put on a boxin
turn or two to amuse the crowd.”
“He called me a windbag,” Redhead
come back, “and I’m goin’ to show him
I ain’t.” . . .
“Tut, tut,” I said. “Such things is of
little account. What do you say if I tdj
the sports the scrap has been called off ?
“No ; he called me a windbag, said
Redhead. “No one’s goin’ to call me a
windbag and get away with it.”
“All right,” I said. “Gang your own
gait, as they say in Derry” ; and 1 begun
lacing up his gloves.
I’ll say this much for Redhead. For
the short time that he was in the ring
he showed that he was willin’. As soon
as 1 give the signal to commence he made
a cornbeef rush and unloosed a swing
that would have knocked Slugger cold it
it had landed. It didn’t land, of course.
No wild swing ever did land on a scrap-
per.. who knows .the first thing about
boxin’. Slugger ducked under it neatly
and Redhead sprawled down on to his
knees.
He was up again in a second, and for
a time he kept Slugger busy dodgin
whirlwind swings and uppercuts. It
didn’t bother our bloke much, but the
crowd thought that Redhead was win-
nin’, and nearly brought the tent down
cheerin’. - -
This went on for about a minute and
a half. Then Slugger steadied Redhead
with a straight left to the chin. Redhead
dashed in again and was brought up
standin’ by another straight left. I knew
by the glint in Slugger’s eyes that the
affray would soon be over.
It was. Slugger gets in quick with a
left to the ribs, and Redhead lowered his
guard. Then across comes the right. It
landed fair on Redhead’s jaw, and he’s
knocked as stiff as a frozen snake.
The crowd wanted to rush the ring to
see if he was badly hurt.
“Stand back, gents.,” I said. “No harm
done. He’ll be right in half a tick.”
But it must have been ten minutes
before he opened his eyes.
When he did come back to his senses
I said: “Well, son, you put up a good
show, anyhow. How did you get it into
your nut that he ain’t Slugger Ryan?”
“Aw, don’t I know he ain’t?” said
Redhead, feelin’ the lump on his chin.
“Slugger Ryan’s got hair the same color
as mine. I read it in the paper.
“No,” he went on, stiflin’ a groan, “I
don’t let nobody have the loan of my
leg and get away with it.”

TO LOSE YOUR
NATURAL TEETH
What a tragedy, what terrible words, when the Dentist says:
“I’m sorry, but they must all come out.” The preparation,
the dread, the period of retirement.... Social life a misery. . .
Business almost impossible. . . The dentist does render
marvellous help with his workmanlike set of artificial teeth,
but he would rather use his skill earlier to prevent trouble,
if you will give him the chance to check up every six months.
HALF THE TEETH LOST
ARE DUE TO PYORRHEA.
When people pass the age of 40, most of them will find
pyorrhea entrenched in their systems. Four out of five will
get it sooner or later, and' many will not know it for five or
ten years after it has begun to work down from the gum line
to the tooth sockets. Once established, pyorrhea cannot be
cured by Forhan’s or any other toothpaste. . . So get
ahead of the trouble instead. Start now to protect and
prevent. y
Give your teeth and gums vigilant care twice daily. Use the
best dentifrice money can buy. When you investigate Forhan’s
you will find it is more than a toothpaste, more than you
expect, perhaps, in so simple a toilet preparation. Dr. R. J.
Forhan devoted a lifetime to the treatment of pyorrhea, and
he is as famous among dentists for his Pyorrhea Astringent,
now used by thousands in the profession, as for Forhan’s
Toothpaste, containing the same principle, for use in the home.
Don’t wait for danger signals. Start with Forhan’s to-day.
