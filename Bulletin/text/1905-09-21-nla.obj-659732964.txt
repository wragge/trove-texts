COPYRIGHT
THE Bill introduced by Senator Keating, now
before the Commonwealth Parliament,
divides subjects of copyright into four
classes: literary, musical, dramatic, artis-
tio.
In the literary class, copyright [which includes
rights of abridgment and translation) is given to
every book that shall be “first published in Aus-
tralia, before or simultaneously with its first pub-
lication elsewhere. ”
When a book is published, it is published. Presumably
the words “ first publication ” make doubly sure ; and
there is no practical objection to them. But in the pre-
■ vious words “ first published,” “ first ” is unnecessary.
Doe 3 “Australia” include Tasmania? New Guinea?
Elsewhere the Bill refers to “ a State,” “ the Common-
wealth,” distinguishing the parts from the whole ; so that
“ Australia ” might be taken to mean the mainland
Btates. “The Cm' .> in we Ith ” should be used through-
out.
The Bill defi u>s ‘ publication” of a book to
mean “ the first offering of the book for sale, or
the first distribution of copies of it, or the first
making of the book accessible to the public with
the privity, in each case, of the author.”
Thus, a foreign author who posts (a) one copy
of a book to a Commonwealth bookseller, or (b)
two copies to two friends in the Commonwealth,
or (c) one copy to a public library in the Common-
wealth, and can prove (a) offering for sale, or (b)
receipt, or • (c) availability to readers (at the time
the book is published elsewhere) will have copy-
right in the Commonwealth.
J*
This copyright begins as soon as a book is thus
“ published.” No public notice within the Com-
monwealth is required. No registration within
the Commonwealth is required. Colonel Jona-
than, of Boston,
sends presentation copies of My Reminiscences
of the War to his friends A, in Perth, and B, in
Ballarat;
or sends a presentation copy to Rockhampton
School of Arts;
or sends a copy to the George Robertson Pro-
prietary or another bookseller for sale,
and his copyright follows automatically. Then he
can sleep on his copyright.
If Col. Jonathan wishes the Commonwealth
Customs to seize and forfeit at any port of import
copies of My Reminiscences which he alleges to be
pirated, he must give to “the Minister” written
notice of the existence of the copyright and of its
term—and the Minister will take his written
notice as proof, and will seize and forfeit (59/2).
(Before a Commonwealth author can substantiate
his copyright he must register it. Col. Jonathan,
of Boston, is not required even to register his
alleged right before stopping goods at the Customs.
He writer to “ the Minister ” that he owns the
right, and “ the Minister ” Relieves him without
proof or parley. By section 59,
Books reproduced without the authority of
the owner,
.In which copyright (gained as above-men-
tioned) subsists in Australia,
are “prohibited imports.” The prohibition is
not left to the Minister s discretion : he is bound
by Senator Keating’s Bill. If such books are
imported “they shall be forfeited ” (59/2): there
is uo alternative unless “the owner of the copy-
right” (alleged) “or his agent” (alleged) has not
given written notice. No registration ; no proof ;
—“written notice” protects Col. Jonathan.)
J*
Col. Jonathan (or the citizen of any other
cation “ whether a British subject or not ”) will
appreciate Senator Keating’s generosity, and the
trouble which he takes to give a foreigner privi-
leges not enjoyed by a native of the Common-
wealth.
But does Col. Jonathan, as a U.S. citizen, recip-
rocate that generosity ? those privileges ?
Not at all: he has more sense.
When Senator Keating writes a book, and
desires copyright in U.S.A., will the U.S.A.
grant him copyright on “publication” of one
copy with a U.S. bookseller or library, or two
copies with two friends in the U.S. ?
It will not.
Will the U.S.A. accept Senator Keating’s or
agent’s bare statement on a sheet of notepaper
that he has a copyright, and forthwith prohibit
importation of copies of his book without his
authority, and seize the copies, and forfeit them—•
all on Senator Keating’s say-so, without registra-
tion, without proof, without inquiry by a com-
petent tribunal ?
It will not.
, But this the U.S.A, will do. It will say, and
it says: Before we grant you copyright in the
U.S.A. you must
1. Not later than the day of first publication
in Australia, deliver to the Librarian of Con-
gress, or deposit in the mail within the United
States, addressed to the L. of C., a printed copy
of the book’s title ;
2. Pay a fee of one dollar;
3. Deliver or deposit as above-mentioned two
copies of the book printed from type set in the
United States, or from plates made therefrom.
Plainly, while 'Col. Jonathan in Australia is
standing on velvet, Senator Keating in the U.S.A.
is standing comparatively on barbed wire and
broken bottles.
With marly reservations, the attitude of the
U.S.A. may be likened to that of other
countries beyond the British Empire, and .of
Canada within the Empire. The most generous
of them will not do as much for the Australian
author as Senator Keating will do for the foreign
author.
Senator Keating’s generosity is excessive ; his
Bill is unjust. Plainly, registration in every case
should precede even the formal admission of copy-
right. Since “ simultaneous publication ” in
Australia, under the Bill, is such an empty farce,
the foreign author should at least formally register
his alleged right not later than the day of first
{lubrication. The separate and informal Customs
ist is unnecessary and a nuisance. One register
should be kept, and from this register the Customs
list of “prohibited imports” should Vie compiled.
But should not the foreign author be asked, in
the interest of Australia, to do a little more ? In
return for his Australian copyright, should he not
be asked (as in America) to put his book in type in
this country ? or (as in Canada) to print it in this
country ?
SPRING POEM.
HERE, then, is opring; and here are the...
Poems ? The writers, at least, are con-
tent so to regard them. Not all, of a
surety : Modesty will refer to “lines”;
Dubiety shall entitle them “verses”; but, lines,
or verses, or stanzas, or poems, they Spring ! they
Spring ! Lambs have no more seasonable election ;
rubber-heels no surer calling. Like lady pedes-
trians, they run in all shapes, these Poems;
though some, eonless it! walk sadly (in funereal
anticipation?); and some, alas'! hobble like
asylumed old men in the indignant streets of
Parramatta: their motive is Spring...and they
are sprung.
A guinea was offered for “ the best ” —and there
is no uifficulty in choice. Hugh IMcCrae, whose
work in verse is becoming memorable, supplies a
piece with a fibre of distinction in it, a touch that
is beyond the ordinary. For verses “written to
order, ’ liis are not so bad. The general level of
the competitors was not high ; but in the selec-
tion given will be found examples of sincere
emotion and an occasional happy turn of phrase..
Several verses are in type and held over.
AUSTRALIAN SPRING.
The bleak-fac'd Winter, with his braggart ■•winds
( Coiled to his scrawny throat in tattered black)
Posts dov;n the highway of his late domain,
His spurs, like leeches, in his bleeding hack.
He rides to reach the huge, embattled hills
Where all the brooding summer he may lie
Engulf din Kosciusko's silent snow,
His shadow waving o'er the lofty sky.
And jolly Spring, with love and laughter gay
Full fo.untaining, lets loose her tide of bees
Upon the leaking ember-flame of bloom
New kindled in the honey-scented trees.
The old, old man forsakes the chimney-hole
Where erst he warmed his bones and lazy blood,
And, clasping Molly to his wheezing breast.
Triumphant floats, cock-whoop, upon the flood.
N.S.W.
HUGH McCRAE.
When the white is drifting down
(In the Spring !)
From the tea-tree’s flowery crown
In the Spring !
When the east is flushed with rose,
And the straining plough-team goes,
Turning in the blossom-snows
In the Spring !
Then the blackbird whistles bold
In the Spring!
Flames the yellow wattle-gold
In the Spring !
And wherever you may roam
Your heart is turning home,
With the turning of the loam
In the Spring !
J.N.
The shear-blades click and merrily ring,
Announcing out West that the time is Spring; '
And the magpie, corella, and parrot all sing
As they circle the sheds of the squatter king
From morning till dewy eve.
And the wild flowers.grow on the western track
Where the Hindoo and Afghan pedlars’ pack
With imported goods, made by red, brown and
black, :
En route to the sheds and camps out back,
Are increasing year by year.
And the wool is packed and carted away,
Not as it was in the good old day,
But by camel and Hindoo and Atghan gay,
Who do the work cheaper, and intend to stay,
And scoop in the boodle each Spring.
WHISKERS.
The Southern earth grows sweet—
Her stubborn winter brown
Conceives in humid heat
A murmuring honey-town.
The magpies lirrup light
Their lovely Springtide calls,
And dance about the bright
Star-sparkling waterfalls.
The stockman riding slow
Against the rosy morn,
Counts o’er his saddle-bow
How many lambs are born.
And thro’ the homestead trees
1 hear the glad refrain
Girl-echoed on the breeze—
“ September’s come again !”
H. McC.
Ihe plains are a surge of golden, a sea of white,
On the hills the starry clematis weaves her vine;
I here are new fern-fronds in the hollows to left
and right,
And the bridle-track has a pungent scent like
wine.
J?he sturdy heaths have put on their bravest dress,
Ihe wattle stands in a l3anae-shower of gold,
And out of the throb and riot of Spring’s caress
My heart awakes to the eager hunger of old.
There’s a sudden welcome, right at the heart of
things.
Like a bride’s whose lover has left her a while
alone;
And something in Nature calls, as a wild-bird
sin __s,
And something deeper than that has a- plaintive
tone.
The mountain gullies have answered the warm
Spring rain,
And the wide, wide plains that stretch till they
meet the blue,
And now, as whenever September comes back
again,
It stirs within me the old heart-hunger for you.
N.M.F.
Hail, flowerful, fanciful season !
Of sighing and singing the time,
When youths lose their hearts and their reason
And perpetrate murder in rhyme.
When maidens dream dreams of brave lovers,
When young men and frogs burst to song,
And she whose age round two-score hovers
Blooms giddily ’mid the young throng.
When grass groweth green and the sky soft,
And green and soft groweth the youth,
Succumbing to innocent eyes oft—
Betimes to the lasses of Booth.
Oh. dear, when we sat by the trellis,
The Australian stars flashed from the jet,
And—but was it you, May, or Alice,
Or Doris ? I really forget.
J.C.O.
Spring has come to us again
In Victoria ; \
Showers of gold laburnum rain,
And boronia.
Spring has come and lilac blows,
Wattle and peach blossom ;
Every maiden wears a rose
On her happy bosom.
Spring has come, and freezias too,
Sunshine and Lent lilies ;
Mountains doff their veils of blue,
Crowned with green each hill is.
Spring has come and thrushes sing,
Lambkins skip in clover,
Butterflies are, all a-wing—
Spring has come, God love her!

Carolling debonair).

Oh, how the warm sun’s rays enfold and fill

The flames of this green fire ?

I know the way they feel the Spring
On Sydney side,
’T is easy for a bard to sing

We ’re shivering still with Winter’s sting
On Melbourne side,
And must imagination spur:
For weeks yet Spring will not occur
On Melbourne side.

And you, like Love, can realise
The dreams of alchemists of old,
For all you touch, beneath our skies,
Is gilded with your sun-wrought gold.

The Maid of the River, by Mrs. Campbell Praed
(Lond., Unwin ; 2s. (id.). A romance of Austra-
lian reality in the writer’s earlier manner: that is,
in her best. There are a bush girl, natural and
attractive ; and a bush man of the orthodox type;
and a false-hearted stranger who leads the heroine
astray through many chapters till exciting first
love has prepared her for a restful second. Then
the faithful bushman mends the broken heart—
and one reflects that this is too frequently the lot
of faithful bushmen. The Bush ip fiction has a
fine character for pluck and devotion ; but can it
never be first favourite ? is it always to remain the
misguided heroine’s “second string”?—Behind
the leading characters are Mrs. Praed’s memories
of Brisbane and the Logan, always passionately
felt and truthfully depicted.
In Lonely Dreaming, by G. A. Dunlop (Lond.,
Gay and Bird)—the price is not given, so we value
them [for one girl] at their weight in [one boy’s]
happy blushes. In the book the blushes become
kisses—so boldly ! —youth’s tender literary de-
bauchery of a butterfly in a rose’s bosom.
Daphnis appeals nowadays in pale-blue covers,
bearded with soft gold: but pipe, but pen, but
lonely dreams, the ages know them, and
Amaryllis knows their end.
Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I love.
For merely verbal poetry, there was alwayß
plenty of that already.
“I believe,” writes a Barrier Truth contributor,
" that Religion is Poetry and Poetry the Motion
of Bliss.” This may be utter folly, but it looks so
like profound wisdom that one can’t be sure.
“Dumas’ grandmother was a negress; and,
referring to his ostentation, one of his enemies
said that he was the sort of man who was capable
of riding behind his own carriage in order to prove
that he kept a negro in his service.”
“ Beau S.” writes: —
A picture-dealer, in Adelaide, visited the studio of a
local painter (a Salon and Academy exhibitor). He
looked through the man’s oil sketches and pictures,
picked out 45, and offered 25f. cash for them—which was
just about the cost of material. Most of the pictures
were mounted, many were also framed, and some
measured as much as 3by 2ft. The dealer submitted an
alternative offer to sell on commission, and suggested
when all were sold they would possibly realise 7Of. Both
offers were declined. The painter has made up his mind
to return to Europe at first opportunity.

Rifle and Pistol Cartridges.
The proof of the pudding is the eating; the proof of
the cartridge is its shooting. The great popularity
attained by Winchester rifle and pistol cartridges
during a period of over 30 years is the best proof of
their shooting qualities. They always give satisfac-
tion. Winchester .22 caliber cartridges loaded with
Smokeless powder have the celebrated Winches-
ter Greaseless Bullets, which make them cleaner to
handle than any cartridges of this caliber made.

HANS PETER RASMUSSEN,
AN ENFEEBLED SYSTEM
THOROUGHLY RESTORED.
TK TRIUMPH IN ULTIMO.
The Case of Mr. A. WALKER.
(By a Special Reporter.)
In all matters affecting the well-being
of the community it is our duty to ex-
ercise every effort and influence in the
direction of promoting a still happier
state of things, and it we only utilise
the chances that offer of helping our
fellow-man we shall do much to
brighten the hearth of many a home.
In this direction such assistance as
that given by Mr. Alfred Walker, of
No. 68 Macarthur-street. iJltimo, is
most valuable, for it deals with a sub-
ject which claims the attention of
everybody. Answering a reporter, Mr.
Walker said :
“1 served my apprenticeship to en-
gineering in Yorkshire, and have been
at the trade all my life, a large por-
tion of which has been spent in this
country, for I came here in the year
1876."
“Do you find the climate agree with
you ?" was asked.
“Pretty well, but about six years
ago I had very bad luck indeed, which
was brought about in this way. My
work had taken me to a place situated
between Douglas Park and Picton.
where I had an engine and boiler to
repair. In putting those things to
rights I put my health all wrong, for
whilst I was on that work I lived in a
tent, and caught a severe cold, which
went right through me. For two or
three months I could not get rid of it,
and in tho meantime the cause of
much suffering had been taking root,
for rheumatism attacked me so badlv
that my legs, arms, and shoulders
were almost useless to me. And the
pain ! I can't find words to describe
it. My neck, too, was so stiff and sore
that I could hardly move it, and by
degrees .1 got so infirm and helpless
that I had to lie up altogether for se-
veral weeks."
“Which would mean considerable fi-
nancial loss to you ?"
“My word it did ! but that was no-
thing compared to the misery I was in.
My right shoulder got worse and
worse, and my sleep became scarcer
than ever. 1 had become so cross and
restless that I could not settle myself,
down to sleep at all satisfactorily un-|
til about midnight. Then I would
sleep and dream till two or three i
o'clock, wake up suddenly, and then
there was no moro rest for me till the
next night. But these were not my
only trials. There was) one very im-
portant drawback, which was that I
could not relish any kind of food ow-
ing to my appetite having left me in
the lurch long ago. When I ate it was
more by force of will than anything
else —a determination to keep up my
strength as well as possible under the
adverse circumstances ; but there was
a stronger element than my own will
at work, and so my strength dwindled
away in spite of me. The internal de-
rangements that had got hold of me
were having a detrimental influence in
every conceivable way. My eyes felt
twice their proper size, and my sight
got bad, for when I started to read I’d
soon have to give up, all the print
seeming to run together, and nearly
every day of my life I was persecuted
with the most violent headaches. Oh !
it was an existence deserving of com-
passion, and I pray to God I’ll never
experience the like again. It was
strange how giddy I used to get, too,
sometimes so severely that I felt quite
sick ; but, at that time, 1 was an aw-
fully bilious subject, and it took noth-
ing'to upset me. I would only require
to take two or three mouthfuls of food
when a feeling came to the stomach as
if churning was going on. The chest al-
so had a stifling feeling about it,
which made me short winded, while
about the back, just across the lower
part here, the aches were something
dreadful. It would be almost impossi-
ble to endure all this without the
nerves giving way, and I assure you
mine broke down with a vengeance. In
point of fact, I was a complete wreck
at the time a friend of mine came to
see how I was doing, and strongly ad-
vised me to give Clements Tonic a
trial.”
“What medicine had you taken be-
forehand ?”
“Well, I had been under the treat-
ment of several doctors, each of whom
paid me great attention and prescribed
medicine, but for all the effect it had
1 might just as well have taken so
much water. Seeing it was useless
continuing with them, I tried my luck
with many of the medicines 1 saw ad-
vertised, only to meet with more fail-
ures. Yes, dozens and dozens of bot-
tles of physic I took before Clements
Tonic was recommended to me, and yet
everything was left for the last reme-
dy to do. I may as -.veil tell you that
some of the chemists tried to palm
their own mixtures, but I said ‘No ; I
have spent enough money already. I’ve
been advised to take Clements Tonic,
and that is what 1 am going to have.’
My word, I was soon thankful I had
acted on the advice given, for after
using a few bottles of Clements Tome
I felt so much better that I hardly
knew myself.”
“In what respect did you notice im-
provement ?”
“When Clement* Tonic had had a fair
chance I experienced benefits in many
directions, but what I was particular-
ly thankful for at the time was a dis-
tinct falling off in the rheumatic tor-
tures that all other medicines had been
incapable of touching. It was marvel-
lous. Naturally I was encouraged to
pursue this latest treatment of mine,
and, by-and-bye, I could hardly re-
strain myself with the joy I felt at the
progress made. I soon started taking
my food as eagerly as if nothing had
ever been the matter with me, and in
due time, to my surprise, I found that
my internal organs were actually per-
forming their proper work again, which
meant that I gained entire freedom
from the old tortures of indigestion,
and began putting on flesh again. It
w T as a new thing for me to retire to
rest at night and not wake up again
till morning, and that’s what I have
to thank Clements Tonic for. It was
also new to rise from bed with a clean
tongue in place of the fur which had
formerly covered it, and no headache
to distress me or no giddy turns dur-
ing the day, and I assure you T often
thanked God that at last I had got a
remedy which could restore vigour to
my enfeebled system, and steadiness
and strength to my nerves. Yes ; these
are some of the good things Clements
Tonic did for me, but I need not enu-
merate them all, as it is sufficient for
me to say that my rheumatic pains
were thoroughly driven away, and I’ve
never had a touch of biliousness nor
indigestion since.”
“Not for six years ?”
“That’s true, and if my story will
help other afflicted people you may
publish it in any form you please.”

Why not look
young ? There’s
' genuine pleas-
ure in holding
back Father

years. You
can do it
1 easily with
Ayer’s Hair
Vigor, for it
gives all that deep
and rich look to the
hair which belongs
to young life.
Ayer’s
Hair Vigor
You know the story—how good
Queen Bess, pointing to the beautiful
hair of a peasant girl, said, “ There’s a
real royal crown. I would trade my
golden one for it.” That was long ago.
Now you can have a ‘ ‘real royal crown’ ’
of your own, simply by using Ayer’s
Hair Vigor. It makes the hair grow
thick and long and stops it falling
out.
When your hair is rich and heavy,
and when the closest inspection fails
to detect a single gray hair, you will
certainly look a great deal younger,
and you will be much better satisfied
with yourself, too. Isn’t that so ?

[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Kiver Song.
VIC.
Afloat upon the river
’Tis sweet to lie and dream
Where willows trail and quiver,
And sunbeams slant and gleam,
And glad birds sing together
And shadows kiss the stream.
Where either side the grasses
Climb up to fneet the sky,
To bend as your boat passes
And wave a gay “ Good-bye ! ”
While up above cloud masses
Like white birds float and fly.
Where cattle cease from drinking
To stand among the fern
To stare with eyes unwinking
And wish you “Safe return,”
While in the west the sinking
Red ball doth flare and burn.
Where Pain and Strife and Sorrow
Fade on the shore behind,
And no thought of the morrow
Oppresses while you find
Your way thro- trees which borrow
Strange lights from sun and wind.
Where Twilight softly creeping
Supplants her sister Day,
And o’er the blossoms sleeping
Trips on her happy way
To Heaven, “ where all weeping
And pain are passed away ! ”
DOROTHY FRANCES McCRAE.
The Flight of Culture.
I am writing more in sorrow
Than in anger, for to-morrow
I am sailing for the country where they speak pure
Londonese;
Where no renderings phonetic
Will offend ray taste, aesthetic,
By a shocking predilection /or the use of tabooed
“ e’s.”
Oft on orgies Bacchanalian
I proceed, when the Australian
Offends my rural senses by the way he utters
“clerk,”
And a sharp and poisoned barb he
Plants in me when saying “ Derby,”
For that wretched “e ” would rouse me were I
lying stiff and dark.
Our ancient names, baronial,
Are lost on the “ Colonial,”
He’s swamped in saying Cholmondeley, and he
founders on Colquhoun ;
To pronounce, correctly, Beauchamp,
I have tried in vain to teach him,
And he gets as near to Majoribanks as a mullet
to the moon.
When I’ve passed beyond the offing,
I shall go again a “goffing”;
I shall swing once more the willow in the fields of
Marylebone;
I shall view the fount of knowledge
At my old-time Magdalene College,
And, in short, I shall recover quite the purest
cultured tone.

JASON.
Unmasked.
I had a glimpse of my lorn self last night,
And I was sore dismayed ;
It was the Prince of Pain struck blind my sight
Doffing his masquerade.
God ! how the furrows of my Soul did show
Barren upon my face—
That desert where Hope died—how long ago ?
In a dead world’s embrace.
Was that the man who sang with every bird,
Taught rivulets to run,
Schooled Echo to repeat sweet sounds she heard,
Hung haloes round the sun ?
Who swung thro’ clouds with a great joyous hold
Upon the young moon’s horn,
Ordered the hills to stand erect and bold,
Like spearmen in the dawn ?
My heart was hot once as the fire that burns
Within the Earth’s great heart.
My blood did pulse like some full tide that turns
Landward with sudden start.
They begged me with appealing eyes to own
God, and to kiss His rod ;
But I made war against Him on His Throne,
And I was maimed by God.
Lo, with hot irons of Hate He burned mine eyes;
And to a weary mill
I put the strength of shoulders and of thighs,
And prayed that God would kill.
Love has forsaken me ; give me no wine
To quench the thirst she leaves,
But the crushed grapes, storm-threshed from Sor-
row’s vine
That ever bears and grieves.
O, had I Night’s eyes, I could weep such tears
Would make a moving sea,
Shored by the stern, inexorable years,
Mourn with its misery.
O for forgetfulness, have I not called
‘ ‘ Lethe ! ” with a loud cry;
Till Terror took those by the heavens walled ?
But—Lethe has run dry.

THE N.S.W. BUDGET.
It is about the best feature of Australian politics
to-day that every responsible politician admits, at
least in a theoretical way, that borrowing is more
or less of an evil. Almost the only open and
unashamed defenders of the old fearsome loan-
drunk who are still on deck are the impossible
Owe’Sullivan— who lacks even the sense to recog-
nise that he belongs to the Dark Ages—and the
riotous public pirate who is seeing political snakes
at the Westralian Treasury. Queensland, having
a real and energetic man at the head of affairs, has
openly sworn off borrowing. Victoria, having
a genuine and energetic bear in command, has
started even to reduce its debt a little and to find
a good deal of public works money out of revenue.
And N.S.W., being run by a real and apologetic
caterpillar, talks honesty, solvency, and self-reli-
ance, and sneaks round with a j ug to the public-
house side-door after dark. The Carruthers finan-
cial statement, which was delivered last week, fully
justified the caterpillar accusation. It was the
effort of a man who has never realised that there
may be principles in politics—who desires to
appeal to the economists with an alleged surplus
and an alleged sinking fund, to appeal to the
demoralised voters by providing public works
without inflicting on anybody the disagreeable
necessity of paying for them, to appeal to every-
body by not levying extra taxation or cutting
down needless outgoings, to pose in the limelight
as a reformer because he is borrowing a shade less
than some of the more awful of his predecessors,
and generally to agree with everybody and slap
everybody affably on the back.
Last year N.S.W. had a surplus, according to
Premier Carruthers, of £187,173 (the State
Statistician denies these figures and puts
the surplus down at only £141,843). This
was part of the sum raised by selling the public
estate. It and a sum of £319,413, also raised
by selling the public estate, went in nominal
“reduction of the public debt,” but all the same
the net public debt increased by £1,122,141. The
amount paid out of land sale revenue in reduction
of the public debt was about £461,000; and the
amount of loan money improperly used as revenue,
by the old swindle of charging to loan account
wholly unproductive items of current expenditure,
and patches, repairs and alterations to productive
works, was just about the same amount, leaving
the sinking fund payments and the surplus just
about the same old sham. Next year it is pro-
posed to keep on reducing the debt per medium of
the sinking fund, and to keep on increasing it per
medium of new loans, and it is expected that the
increase will beat the decrease by fully £1,000,000.
So far Carruthers is not scattering the loan
funds as gaily as some of his predecessors; but the
piling up of the great liability goes on pretty
steadily, none the less.
# * * *
There isn’t in N.S.W. one sign of any attempt;
such as Bent and Morgan are making, to pay for
public works—even for unproductive public works
—out of revenue. The only idea in the alleged
mind of Carruthkrs seems to be that if loans
cease—as they must do some day—public works
and public progress must both stop dead, and
even the making of roads must leave off. The
actual income expected for next year is £11,288,300,
the expenditure which Carruthers sees ahead is
£11,407,909, and his only hope of making ends
meet is that some rather indefinite “savings”
may be made, and that some refunds may
turn up. Only as recently as 1901 N.S.W. ran its
affairs, apart from postal expenditure, on an
annual outlay of £10,202,487, and to-day Joseph
the Economist can hardly see his way to struggle
through on an expenditure, apartfrom postal expen-
diture, defence and some other charges, of a million
more. The revenue is expected to be about £660,000
more than it was in 1901, and it has no longer
to cover military and naval charges, and post
and telegraph outlay as it did then—yet the
struggle of the State incompetents to make the
ledger look square, even after charging all the
productive and most of the unproductive works to
loans, and spending all the land receipts, is as
dreadful as ever.
* * * *
The N.S.W. borrowing policy has now reached
a point where, even supposing the tramways, rail-
ways, Harbor Trust, and all the water and sewerage
undertakings paid full interest on their cost —
which they never do —the amount of annual
interest to be made good out of taxation would be
over £925,000. Judging by last year’s experience
of the inability of the works above-mentioned to
pay interest, the amount to be made good out of
taxation will probably be at least £1,000,000.
That represents 14s. per inhabitant. In other
words, the amount of unproductive debt which
N.S.W. has heaped up in about 50 years—the
dead horse debt, or the debt which isn’t repre-
sented by anything “permanent and reproduc-
tive ” —represents a greater burden per inhabitant
than the whole debt, productive or unpro-
ductive, of Great Britain, Austria, Hungary,
Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Holland,
Roumania, Russia, Servia, Sweden, Norway,
Switzerland, Turkey, Japan, or the United
States. The burden of unproductive debt in
N.S.W. is 12 times the burden of the whole debt
of the United States, and presents almost equally
amazing results in comparison with the liabilities
of a good many other States. And this result has
been arrived at without any war bills, without any
great naval or military outlay, and after squan-
dering a land revenue which, in proportion to
population, is greater than any other State was
ever blessed with in the world’s history. Yet, so
far, there is no sign of a statesman arising who
will protest against a continuance of the system
which has produced these remarkable effects.
The money that is raised by jobbing away
the public estate is still to be spent as
if it were ordinary revenue. All kinds of
public works are still to be charged to loans,
and the old lie that the loan expenditure is
“permanent and reproductive” is still to be
accepted by common consent. The crowd which
got into the Assembly last year on its solemn
promise to. vote for the abolition of all loan ex-
penditure, and for the application of the lands
revenue to public works, has mostly proved to be a
crowd of frauds and hypocrites. The Labor
party, which is pledged to vote against all loan
expenditure except for works which will pay full
interest and 1 per cent, sinking fund—and that is
practically equivalent to voting against all loan
expenditure—lies very low. And affairs drift
along much as usual.
* * * *
Last year N.S.W. found itself blessed,
even after paying its share of the Federal ex-
penditure, with about £1,400,000 more reve-
nue than it enjoyed in the final year of
separation, and, in addition to this increase of
revenue, it had been relieved of many items of
expenditure. This great influx of revenue was
commonly described in N.S.W, as “extortion”
and a shameful ‘' heaping of burdens on the backs
of the people,” but, all the same, N.S.W. promptly
spent the money, and piled up, more deficits oh
top of it, and increased "its borrowings on top of
that; and. amid all this, shriek of expenditure it
didn’t pay for any public works or resumed lands
out of the new revenue, nor did the idea of putting
something to a sinking fund occur to the demented
community. Now the great additional Customs
receipts have dropped off a little, and though
J oseph Carruthers belongs to the fiscal school
which declares that N.S.W. should never have
had the tariff which produced these extra receipts,
he weeps over the small decline, and says that if
the reduction goes any further he doesn’t
know what a poor miserable Premier like himself
is to do. Meanwhile he proposes to build out of
loans 310 miles of new railway in the North Coast
district, which railway is estimated to cost
£2,700,000, and to add an annual deficit of £70,000
to the dead-horse interest which has to be made
good out of taxation. This North Coast line was
one which Premier Carruthers once glibly pro-
posed, in the days when he was a bogus reformer,
to pay for out of revenue.
» * * *
There is a great weariness about this slipshod,
hand-to-mouth policy of frequent big deficits,
occasional petty surpluses, constant selling of the
people’s capital to pay current expenses—this
policy of loans, fakes, weeps, dodges and lamenta-
tions. Those who advocate honesty, solvency and
self-reliance, and ask that the whole loan policy
should be put an end to for ever, that the present
. sinking fund payments should be a real reduction
of the public debt, and that the land revenue should
be set aside for the promotion of a vigorous public
works polity, do not demand anything either large
or unreasonable. In proportion to its population
the land revenue of N.S.W. is a huge gift, or
endowment—a vast revenue which falls on the
Government from heaven, so to speak, and for
which it has neither to toil nor to spin—the like of
which no other country on this earth enjoys. It
is only a temporary blessing as things are going,
but it will last for a good many years yet. If this
land revenue is all set. aside for public works,
N.S.W. will only be called upon to pay its
ordinary expenses of government out of taxation,
as almost every other country has to do—most
countries, in fact, do more than that, and
pay for many of their public works out of
taxation, and for the cost of wars, and
the upkeep of bloated land and sea arma-
ments. The only possible theory why N.S.
Wales can’t pay its ordinary expenses of
government out of taxation, is that the average
inhabitant, when it comes to a question ot Puolic
honesty and self-reliance, is the greatest fool, the
worst incapable, or the most sorrowful coward on
this earth. It is on the supposition that lie is all
these objectionable things that the loan policy ot
See, Owe’Sullivan and Carruthers is based.
If that policy endures it seems as if a time will
come wlieii the whole tax-revenue of the State
must go to pay interest on the great public
dead horse—the debt that was incurred under
false pretences for temporary and unproductive
shirks, -
IMMIGRATION AND AN INSECT.
In the scheme of things, we are taught, everything
has its uses. The mosquito is something else than
a midnight tormentor with a lance and trumpet.
The smelly creature with a brush was made for
other things than to wantonly destroy poultry
and to provide, when chased by the English
squire in the hunting field, an illustration of
“ the uneatable pursued by the unspeakable.
In fact, all things have their uses, which
disclose themselves to patient inquiry. Even
Joseph Carruthers, Premier of N.S. Wales, js
no exception. He has his use. It is to demon-
strate to Australia the hopelessness of expecting
any good to come out of a system which leaves to
a State Government any power in national
matters, and to preach by his acts the necessity of
extending the Federal control. The mosquito is
Nature’s hint to look to your swamps or expect
malaria. Joseph Carruthers is the kindly-
meant warning that the State “right’ to bean
obstacle in the way of Australia and a, sour
objector in its National councils is a “ right that
needs to be abolished. And very happily has he
been placed in N.S. Wales, whose frantic mud-
slinging politicians stood so long in the way of
Australian union, and managed to so seriously
limit its powers when the Constitution was being
determined. If N.S. Wales isn’t taught by
Joseph Carruthers to loathe the very phrase
“State Rights,” and to be in future a good
Federalist, then N.S. Wales has no sense of
shame, nor sense of humor, nor sense nor sensi-
bility of any kind. # # #
T. A. Coghlan, Agent-General for New South
Wales, and chairman of the Board of Australian
Agents-General in London, recently communi-
cated to his State a report on immigration.
There is a general agreement in Australia that a
strengthening of the population, other than by the
birth-rate, is necessary. Differences exist as to
details. Some would have a horde of immi-
grants of any sort brought at any price
with loan money, and dumped on the wharves
here, to sink or swim. Others pin their faith to
purely agricultural immigration, and would scour
Europe—since Britain offers but a poor recruiting
ground for that sort of labor—for the Russian,
Hungarian or Italian substitute for Hodge ; the
Sydney Evening News is the chief champion
of this idea, and aims at the importation of extra-
cheap foreigners to cut the already miserably low
wages of the agricultural workers. Others plead for
Federal tariff action to force into growth manufac-
tures, which would give the best of all chances to the
immigrant, with an accompanying policy of open-
ing for settlement lands on the coast area to meet
the extra demand for agricultural products which
the growth of manufactures would create.
Coghlan, as a servant of the State of N.S.W.,
could not enter into a discussion of tnese political
considerations. But in his very able report he
considered the other aspects of the question
acutely and sensibly. He showed how the natural
trickle of emigrants to Australia the influx of
people possessed of a little money leaving Europe
with the idea of making an independence —is
stopped by the Stinking Fish stories of Australian
politicians and tourists. Explaining the methods
which other new lands adopt to, attract emigrants,
Coghlan was able also to show that the
natural advantages of Australia are far greater
than those of Canada. Concluding, he pointed
(of course, without being able to suggest a remedy)
to the fact that Australia is in an inferior political
position, as compared with Canada, in attracting
immigration. In Canada, the Dominion Govern-
ment is supreme. In Australia, the Common-
wealth Government has not affirmed its supremacy,
and begs the consent or help of the State
Governments in many most important matters.
The publication of this report draws attention
to, two points in particular :
(1) That emigration which would naturally flow to Aus-
tralia is diverted by the Stinking Fish stories of Australian
politicians, newspapers, and tourists,
(2) That the matter of promoting a large immigration
to Australia can only be effectively dealt with by Federal
action such as Canada takes.
This was followed by the printing of a remarkable
correspondence between Deakin and Carruthers,
On July 23, Deakin— the man whom the Syd-
ney Cabbage-tree Mob regards as the arch-
fiend of the Victorian conspiracy to rob, degrade
and ruin N.S.Wales—wrote to Carruthers inti-
mating that the Australian Government was
seriously considering the question of immigration,
and asking if the Commonwealth Government
might communicate with the various State Agents-
General on the subject through their chairman,
Coghlan. Letters of similar purport were sent
to the other State Premiers, and each one cordially
agreed to the proposal, as a means towards promot-
ing the influx of desirable population to Australia.
But the insect Carruthers sent a churlish refusal.
Thereupon Deakin (who for an arch-fiend is a
very affable person, and who for an enemy of N.S.
Wales shows a wonderful amount of patience with
its disgraceful and scandalous politicians) wrote
again begging Carruthers not to be an unplea-
sant mule-no word even remotely approaching
“ mule ” appeared in the letter, so this is a mere
figure of speech—but to fall into line with the
other State Premiers and allow the Commonwealth
to ask the State’s Agent-General for advice. This
seems to have made Joseph a little ashamed of
himself, and on August 17 he gave a grudging
consent. DeAkin sent a cordial note of thanks
and promptly communicated with Coghlan. On
August 25 Joseph hardened his heart and
wrote again to Deakin withdrawing the per-
mission he had given on August 17. The position
now is that whilst the Commonwealth can
communicate with the Agent-General of
any. other State, it must not dare to write
to the Agent-General of New South Wales
on a subject which is of the most vital moment
to all Australia, and of particular importance to
New South Wales as the State which has probably
the greatest undeveloped resources in the Com-
monwealth. New South Wales stands as a sulky
child, snuffling in the corner, and refuses to be fed
with the rest of the family. And later on Carru-
thers will yelp because N.S.W. “ wasn’t con-
sulted.”
* » * *
It is a disgusting situation for the Australian
who is, also. a. N.S, Waler that this petty Car-
ruthers should have the power to represent
the most powerful State of the Union as a
hog, and a badly-behaved hog at that. But it is,
in a sense, a proper penalty for having Oarru-
THERS as Premier. And it has this advantage,
that it emphasises the necessity of making the
attraction of population a purely Federal matter,
as the Constitution contemplated. Whilst any-
thing is left to the “agreement of the States
any one insect Premier can make agreement im-
possible. It is Carruthers to-day. It was
Jenkins yesterday. It might be Philf or Evans
or Bent another day. What the Australian
Government should have power to do, and should
do, comes under these headings :
(1) Fostering of manufacturing industries by high
tariffs ; encouraging an influx of labor suitable for such
industries when established.
(2) Opening up the lands on the coast. Encouraging
agricultural settlers to come to those lands, and assisting
them through the first steps of settlement.
It does not seem that any constitutional amend-
ment is required to fulfil those conditions. But,
if it were required, it should be effected. As it is,
the Commonwealth has power to establish local
industries by tariff and bonus, and to assist the
immigrants it wants to come, and to prohibit the
entry of the immigrants it does not want. That
gives full and unmistakable control of the more
important branch of immigration. Further,
the Australian Government has undoubted
power, if it chooses, to impose a gradu-
ated land-tax calculated to make the lock-
ing up of big estates unprofitable, and the
locking Up of big estates by absentees ruinous.
That would make a certainty of opening up some
land for agricultural immigrants. Also there is
nothing to prevent the Australian Government
acquiring by purchase State or private lands,
and devoting them to closer settlement. If it had
definite power to compulsorily resume State lands
for close settlement without the consent of the
State affected, paying for them by taking over
their value in State liabilities, it would be all that
the case requires. Probably it has that power,
since it may compulsorily acquire “ land for public
purposes ” from the States, and the settlement
of immigrants is, surely, just as much a public pur-
pose as the drilling of soldiers or the stabling of
post-office horses.

Clause 122 of the Constitution gives the Com-
monwealth power, if it chooses, to make laws for
the government
of any territory surrendered by any State to, and accepted
by, the Commonwealth, or of any territory placed by the
Queen under the authority of and accepted by the Com-
monwealth or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth.
Clause 51 (sub-section xxxi) gives the Common-
wealth Parliament power for
the acquisition of property on just terms from any
State or person for any purpose in respect of which the
Parliament has power to make laws.
Immigration is one of those purposes. Then the
Australian Parliament has also (Clause 52, sub-
section ii.) exclusive power of legislation in
matters relating to any department of the Public Service
the control of which is by this Constitution transferred
to the Executive Government of the Commonwealth.
That can refer to an Immigration Department, if
constituted. On the other side there may be
argued Clause 123 :
The Parliament of the Commonwealth may, with the
consent of the Parliament of a State and the approval of
the majority of the electors of the State voting upon the
question, increase, diminish, or otherwise alter the limits
of the State, upon such terms and conditions as may be
agreed upon, and may, with the like consent, make
provision respecting the effect and operation of any
increase or diminution or alteration of territory in
relation to any State affected.
That permissive clause clearly infers that the
Parliament of the Commonwealth may not ,
lacking the permission of the State affected and
of a majority of its electors, increase, diminish, or
otherwise alter a State’s limits. But this only
applies to an alteration of boundaries. It does not
in any way limit the powers given by clauses 51,
52 and 122. To quote Quick and Garran on the
Constitution :
The section is worded not as a limitation of powers else-
where conferred but as an additional and substantive
power. . . . What was in the minds of those who advised
and framed the amendment was to make more adequate
provision to guard against the possible taking of country
from one State and transferring it to another.
The Commonwealth has enough power, if it is
vigorously exercised, to carry out an immigration
policy. It can simply ignore the petty churlish-
ness of Carruthers or any other insect that waves
threatening antennae in the path. And, since the
object is the general good of Australia—an object
which has the sympathy of the people if not of the
politicians of N.S. Wales—it should do so. It
would be intolerable if a little State Parliament-
elected under the whip of a venal press, and amid
the shrieks of enraged sectaries, a Parliament in
which land agents and their creatures are so
strongly represented—were to be allowed to stand
in the way of Australian development.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Braddon Clause and Other Matters.
A small announcement, which looked to most
people like a matter of no importance, appeared
in the daily papers last week. This, taken from a
Sydney journal, expresses the general effect of it:
As the result of communications between the States,
New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Wea-
tralia have agreed to make a joint representation to the
Federal Government, regarding a settlement of the
financial arrangements between the Commonwealth ana
the States. It is now proposed to ask the Commonwealth
Government to amend the Constitution by providing for
a return of a fixed sum to the States after the expiry of
the Braddon clause arrangement, and for the extension
of the book-keeping period for 10 years. Tasmania has
agreed to the first proposal, and Queensland wants the
Braddon clause ro be continued without the book-keeping.
All the States that are in harmony on the matter will now
make a joint representation to the Federal Government.
It is to be hoped that every genuine Federalist in
the Australian Parliament—every member who is
an Australian first and a Crow-eater or a Corn-
stalk a long way afterwards—will insist on the
Deakin Government replying with a loud
and definite “No” to these proposals. The
Braddon clause should be abolished on the
very first day that the Constitution makes its
abolition possible, and the Commonwealth should
not pledge itself to permanently return a fixed
sum, nor an unfixed sum, nor any sum at all to
the States. The clauses dealing with refunds to
the States were temporary devices put into the
Constitution to bridge over a transition period—
to keep the States solvent until the Common-
wealth could arrange to take over their debts and
some of their costly departments. The demand
for extension arises out of the unfortunate
circumstance that most of the State Premiers
do not want to surrender their debte or their
departments. It would be a great gam to Aus-
tralia if many things were taken over; there would
be a large saving of money, and there would
be much gained in the way of making Aus-
tralia a real nation instead of a loose league ol
snarling, communities. Everything that can be


done to increase the power and responsibilities
of the Australian Parliament, which stands
for union, and to diminish the State
authority, which stands for disunion, is a
step gained towards the attainment of the
national ideal. But as the national ideal grows,
the pomp and circumstance of the State Premiers
must necessarily be diminished, which is a matter
of great importance to some State Premiers, but of
mighty little importance to the people at large.
If the States retain the management of their own
debts and as many other things as possible,
while the Commonwealth finds and hands over to
the States the money to pay interest with, it
makes the State budgets larger, it gives the States
an excuse to retain their six separate Agents-
General to negotiate with financiers in London, it
keeps N.S.W. securities, and Queensland securi-
ties, and four other batches of securities on
the market instead of wiping them all away
and having nothing but Australian securities, and
it enables State Premiers to pose as men of large
discourse looking before and after. And all
this is a disunited and miserable arrange-
ment. It might be a fair enough thing
to extend the book-keeping clause (which
provides that each State shall be charged
only with its own expenses on a population basis)
for so long as the Braddon clause (the clause
which provides that three fourths of the Customs
and excise revenue shall be returned to the States)
lasts, but the Braddon clause should go at the
earliest possible moment, and with it the book-
keeping arrangement. The Commonwealth should
take over the State debts in the largest and most
liberal spirit that can be devised. It should also
take over the Education Departments, to make
sure that it is relieving the States of sufficient,
and more than sufficient, of their expenditure to
compensate for the withdrawal of the subsidies
now paid under the Braddon clause, and it should
make old age pensions a Federal charge. F urther,
it should take over the railways with a guarantee
that a certain number of much-needed extensions
in each State, including the two transcontinental
lines, would be undertaken within a reasonable
time, and that the establishment of a uniform
gauge would be taken in hand. But as a guarantee
that the States will not spread the discussion on
these matters till the crack of doom, the Australian
Parliament should intimate clearly that there will
be no extension of the Braddon clause and no
further payment of Federal subsidies to the States.
While these payments last there is no finality
anywhere.
N.S.W.’s Insect Premier.
Last year was one of the softest snaps any N.S.W.
Treasurer ever had ; yet that shocking posturer
; and humbug, Treasurer Carruthers, had the gall
.to introduce his Budget speech with the remark
that the year had been “one of the severest the
iGovernment could have encountered, and it was
• only by great care we could avoid another deficit ”
—the case over again of the quack telling his dupe
.that the latter had had 15 fatal diseases, and would
Ja&ve died nine times if a Providence that knew
JBDfc* business hadn’t sent him the quack’s way.
.As .a matter of fact, Carruthers got from stamp
• duties £473,283, against Waddell’s £462,570 in
1904,; he got more land-tax ; he got more income-
-tax.; more license fees; he got £4,527,368 from
• railways as against Waddell’s £4,263,743; he
• sold £45.76 of Centennial Park lands, and threw the
proceeds .into re venue ; and he put aside £50,000
less for a .sinking fund than Waddell did. Yet
1904 was reckoned a boom year, and but for the
prodigious load of debt and the vast incapacity in
ihigh places which N.S.W. struggles under, it
: should have shown a huge surplus. Compared
with 1903, Carruthers got £1,491,869 net from
• the railways as against £1,048,594 ; from this, one
•source he swept in £443,275 more net revenue.
And still Carruthers called his year “one of the
• most severe” that a Government could have
( encountered. A Treasurer not so desperately
-anxious to show himself off as a Heaven-sent
• genius in the finance and general reform busi-
ness might have taken some pride in pointing
• out that the country had had a fine season, and a
. splendid harvest, that the area under cultivation
• had increased enormously, and that the surplus of
(exports had passed all previous records; but
• Joseph preferred to throw mud at his country, so
ithat nobody should possibly overlook the brilliant
• insect that crawled over the mud-stain.

The Yellow Pup’s Drooping Tail.
.A 'NJB.W. Parliamentary Committee sat last
week (to(Consider a charge of corruption brought
. against the civil service by Parson Woolls Rut-
. LEDGE, -who had been blathering loudly about how
. an official named Hall was ejected from the ser-
wice when -a Protestant, and couldn’t get back till
• he turned Roman Catholic, whereupon the service
received him with open arms, and enthusiastically
appointed him to a billet worth £IOOO a year. Con-
sidering that anybody with sense enough to look up
i the Public Service List could see that the £IOOO a
year, at all events, was a myth, it was a rather
t crude and inefficient yarn, but the reverend Orange
..firebrand was so loud in his demands for full
r inquiry that at last he got it. Then, as was to be
< expected, he refused to give evidence, and
• sneaked away to write to the papers. The first day
• of the sittings Rutledge declined to proceed
• unless he were made a party to the inquiry
• so that he would have power to cross-
-examine witnesses. The second day—-this matter
• having been fixed up—he gathered up his holy
• coat-tails and left without giving any evidence
. after all. At the beginning of the second day’s
work he wanted to deliver addresses about things
• which he alleged had been said concerning him in
. the Assembly, and when the chairman, Griffith,
M.L. A., said that the committee was only autho-
rised to inquire into the truth of Rutledge’s own
doud statement about Hall’s appointment, it
• appeared that that was the one thing the pious
(but unbusiness-like Rutledge didn’t want to talk
>of. He was informed that he could bring forward
•any and every kind of evidence provided it was in
•support of his statement about Hall’s appoint-
ment, and he made a large and irrelevant
remark to the effect that he warited “British
justice, not Boer justice.” As no one rose
and waved the British flag and sang “Rule
Britannia” at this touching appeal, the Rev.
Woolls-Rutledge made the easy and simple
statement that the chairman was biassed,
and then he backed out. He didn’t overwhelm
the chairman and the committee and the reporters
with a mass of solid evidence, and get the
damning proofs into the Herald and Tele-
graph next morning ; he just said the
chairman was biassed—and faded. Woolls
afterwards complained in the papers that
the committee wouldn’t allow him to make
“a few remarks”—the yearning of the par-
sonical person to make a few remarks instead of
sticking to the question at issue is pathetic ; also
he explained that he had desired to go into a
question about certain letters which the chairman
had allegedly written, and to swear to certain re-
marks the chairman had allegedly made—in fact, he
seemed to want to do anything except prove his
own assertions. Also he ascribed his bolt to his own
personal courage. Woolls-Rutledge, writing to
the daily papers about his own courage, is a thrill-
ing spectacle, and faintly suggestive of the Ancient
Pistol, who departed, a bashed man with his
stomach full of compulsory leek, and said that all
Gehenna would ring with the details of the out-
rage.
The Primary Producer.
“ A manufacturing-artisan is worth to the community
about three times the value of a ‘ primary producer.’ ” —•
Bulletin, 20/71’05.
Dear Bulletin : That depends on the brand of
“ primary producer ” the comparison is made with.
Compare the artisan with the alluvial gold digger
(working on his own), and he willpan.out about
six times the value of the primary man. There
are many thousands of men ekeingout a miserable
existence in Australia in search of the penny-
weight, whose gross average earnings are certainly
not 10s. per week all the year round. From a
national or economic standpoint their labor is
wasted; for they are working on depleted gold-
fields, ground that has been turned over and over
again, and there is no chance of fresh discoveries
resulting from their work. The pathos of their
calling lies in the fact that these fossickers know
perfectly well how hopeless is their outlook. They
are digging away to get a crust. There is no
“gold fever” about it, no romance, no delusive
hope of making a rise. They dig because there is
no other work to do. A large percentage of these
are skilled artisans. You will find hundreds
of these so-called “ miners ” are fitters, moulders,
pattern-makers, iron-workers tradesmen of all
kinds. There is nothing for them to do in their
own trades. They are men of too much energy
and self-respect to become town loafers, working,
perhaps, two or three days per month, so they hide
their poverty and despair in the bush, where they
can at least have a hut to call their own, firing and
water free, and a chance to win a pennyweight or
two weekly for tucker. The younger men engaged
in fossicking are mostly the sons of the old diggers,
but had we been a manufacturing community they
would not have followed such a GoD-forsaken
calling for 10s. a week; they would rather be
trained artisans. The struggle gets harder every
year for the fossicker, and the pennyweight be-
comes more elusive; so many of them trap wallabies,
selling the skins and eating the meat ; others
cultivate gardens if handy to a township; and
they all rush for an odd shift at battery-feeding,
wood-cutting, &c. Yet blatant wind-bags like
Reid and Conroy crack up the great destiny of
the “primary producer.” Socially, the fossicker
is a dead letter. Marriage, in most cases, is
not for him. The birth-rate troubles him
little. He lives mostly in a solitary hut.
If he is married, you will often see his
wife toiling with him in the claim helping
to keep the flour-bag from the “ southerly
wind.” Children who should be at school may be
seen on any old goldfield doing work much too
heavy for them in the way of “helping father.”
These poorly-clad youngsters have no chance of
developing into healthy manhood. Having spent
the past six years moving from one worn-out
goldfield to another, I have seen and noted all
these things, and they cry with a loud voice for
Protection—and plenty of it. If the Labor mem-
bers could be sentenced to live for 12 months on
the gold they could dig, they would probably
hasten to dig up the fiscal issue at the end of the
year, and hurry along with the badly-needed tariff
wall, behind which thousands of their compatriots
would find decent work and decent living, and
get away from being primary producers.— Janor.

The Eccentricities of Bent’s Board.
The principal misdeed of the Board appointed to
buy estates for closer settlement in Victoria will
come under discussion in Bent’s Parliament very
shortly, when the Overnewton property is offered
to would-be settlers. A Bulletin article —
“Closer Settlement on Rocks” —has already
touched upon the forthcoming scandal. Since
then another 1000 acres have been added to
the Overnewton purchase, making it some
10,000 acres in all, of which not more than
3200 acres are of any possible value for farm-
ing. About half of this suitable land
is in one block, the rest being found in
widely separated patches. The general charac-
ter of the Overnewton property is quite
well known in Melbourne, seeing that the nearest
point is only 13 miles distant from the G.P.O.
Much of the land bought by the Board in May last
was originally got from the Government by
William Taylor in the 50’s, for grazing purposes.
It was poor grazing, but it sufficed. In 1904, not
long after Taylor’s death, the mortgagees offered
the whole of the estate at auction without elicit-
ing a bid, but subsequently two little lots at either
end were privately sold. The mortgagees then
offered their white elephant to the Government,
and the Minister for Lands took a report on
the subject, with the result that lie wouldn’t
make a bid. Finally the Closer Settlement
Board was easily persuaded to take up the rejected
territory at a price (£60,000) which would not be
absurdly excessive if it were a grazier’s investment,
but which represents a sinful waste of public
money considering that the land can only be
allotted for settlement in 250-aere blocks, and
three-fifths of the whole area is so rocky that a
plough can’t run over it. The Board’s purchase is
an almost incredibly bad bargain. Even if the
Act permitted the stony land to be sold for
grazing, nobody could do any good with a block of
less than 400 or 500 acres. The maximum block
available under the Act is 250 acres, and this must
be devoted to farming settlement. The Act under
which the Board purchased the Overnewton
Estate, will not permit 6800 acres of it to have
any value whatever so long as it remains
on the Government’s hands. The Board,
of course, has not been solely engaged in buying
tracts of basaltic rock, tempered by oases of
respectable; soil. The Wyuna estate of 23,000
acres, if carefully subdivided and assisted with a
proper irrigation channel, may carry ljO settlers
comfortably. The Memsie estate has a fairly good
average, including some first-class bits on both
sides of the Loddon. There is no irrigation sys-
tem there, but the land is pretty well watered, and
its value has been proved at open auction in the
past. If the Board had bought nothing less
promising than Wyuna and Memsie there
would not be a rumpus in store for that
misguided body of experts. But apart from the
Overnewton scandal, there is the stupid mis-
management of Spring Vale (Kiewa), lately
opened to selection under circumstances that in-
vited a fiasco. The land has a river running
through it, and for two days a year, on an average
(as is shown by the gaugings), the fertilising stream
overflows its banks without doing any damage to
the local agricultural prospects. Yet the plan
issued by the Board to encourage settlement on
the river margins was calculated to gladden
the Stinking Fish party. The land, which
is benefited by an occasional river soaking
and immediately drained again, was descriled
on the plan as “swampy” and “subject
to partial inundation.” Thus the Board libelled
the property it was offering* and to make the
matter worse it issued the plan at the wettest
season of the year, and offered the land for sale at
a moment when the river was abnormally floody.
Consequently the Board had no applications for
Spring Vale Estate blocks when the settlers were
invited to roll up. They will come along presently
when all fear of “inundation ” has been dispelled*
but in the meantime Bent’s scheme of Closer
Settlement without compulsory purchase looks
even a little more unpromising than it really is.

In Seddon’s Country.
Thus Frank Morton
What a country it is, this country of Maoriland ! Since
I lapsed into journalism, an Ishmaelite and a scallywag,
16 years ago, I have spoiled paper in many lands ; but I
never before sojourned in one that bore the marks of
prosperity so broad and deep as Seddon’s coun-
try. Seddon is a tremendous fact only realisable
by coming to live in Seddon’s land. Richard Seddon is
the Government of Maoriland ; and in Richard Seddon
all things in Maoriland live and move and have their
being. You meet his opponents everywhere ; but at the
bottom of all criticism, deep at the heart of the most
clamorous local grievances, there is always a great re-
spect for Seddon, a great confidence in the man who, in
the country he has shaped and guided, has made himself
the master of his time.
Dunedin is charming. It is the City of God and Sandy
Macgregor ; and I have met Sandy, and found him worth
meeting. He’s vera respectable. When he buys The
Bulletin he wraps it up in the Christian Outlook and
takes it home recklessly in the bottom of his bag ; and,
being a man of clean scruple and righteous mind, he
doesn’t pass it over the fence to the neighbor on Sunday
afternoons, George MacDonald is his novelist—when he
is sufficiently depraved to read fiction ; and in poetry he
reckons that '‘Paradise Lost” comes 397th after‘‘The
Cottar’s Saturday Night.” He has a precious taste in
oleographs ; and he reckons that Norman Lindsay is a
bad deevil, although his women are gae fine. In a shop
window in Prince’s-street are various partial nakednesses
after Asti ; and round that window Sandy is always
loitering—to meditate on the depravity of mankind.
The women of Dunedin are a delight and a disappoint-
ment. They are a delight because they are invariably
most gently courteous, with no trace of the snob in them,
They are a disappointment because—well, because their
splendor stops too soon, so to speak. They are full in (he
shoulders, torso, hips, but away beneath that .they lapse
into dreadful insignificance of shank. The wee bit lassies,
up to fourteen or so, are admirably supported ; but after \
that there is a certain failure of contours, a sad
shrivelling. In color, too, they fail. Their bright cheeks
are of too vivid a red. They have not the Tasmanian
pink and white. They have (alas!) the Tasmanian
development of ankle.
I have a keen nostril; but so far I cannot discover that
Dunedin has, or tolerates, our “ sassiety.” The folk are
homely and cordial in their careful way, and truly hos-
pitable to the stranger. I dare say that they run into
cliques as in other cities ; but there is no big shoddy
clique that forms a syndicate for the exploitation of its
collective wife, and affects to own the castle and despise all
cleaner clay—no “ Guvmentouse ” clique as in Australian
States. I’ve been to one or two “ functions,” and so far
I have found the atmosphere very clean and sweet.
And Maoriland is content with itself. I hear no talk of
bad times, and no grumbling about taxation. Municipal
taxes in Dunedin are very heavy, and will yet be heavier ;
but no one passes sleepless nights. The hotels close at
10 p.m. in Dunedin, and we are even reconciled to that.

The Problem of the Prisoner.
In the 1905 N.S.W. Prisons’ Report, Comptroller
Neitenstein shows again that he brings to his
somewhat thankless and unpleasant work a mental
outlook which is both sensible and sympathetic.
For some years Neiten,stein’s reports have been
of value since they threw light on social problems
gleaned from .observation of gaol life, and did not
confine themselves to mere recital of prison facts.
Just as a big hospital is a good training ground
for a doctor, a gaolsystem is a valuable school for
the reformer. He learns there the symptoms of
the mental and moral diseases which afflict society.
Since the average sociologist either cannot, or will
not, include a term as a gaoler in his course of
education, he must rely on the observations of
gaol officials; and N.S. Wales is fortunate in
having at the head of its system so sensible
an observer as Neitenstein. The 1905 report
refers to the effort being made to expand the
industrial branch of gaol life. “If the reform of
criminals is to be accomplished, employment of a
regular and intelligent kind is absolutely essen-
tial,” declares Neitenstein. Later he insists
that it must be of “ a useful kind.” Therein he is
right. Useless work is debasing. It impresses
the worker with a sense of the tyranny and caprice
of his task-master. But useful work dignifies the
average man. There is nothing more ghastly than
toil at the treadmill, nothing more reformative
than the useful work which gives to the convict
the feeling that he can still do something for him-
self, his family and society. In Russia—the bar-
barous Russia of the British press—practically
every criminal has the right to work in prison for
the benefit of his family. If statistics were available,
it would probably be found that the Russian prison
system was practically self-supporting. It is not
yet so, unfortunately, in N.S. Wales. In 1904
gaol labor in that State earned £19,000 from the
work of, roughly, 1880 prisoners, an average pro-
duction of £lO a head. The cost of the gaol
system was £99,321, or, roughly, £52 a head.
The ideal of prison management should be to get
the prisoners to produce that £52 a head and
as much over as possible, making part of the cost
of the prisoner’s maintenance, and a sum towards
the maintenance of the prisoner’s family (if any) a
first charge, and devoting the remainder, or part
of it, to providing a gratuity for the confinee on
liberation. There is probably no reason why male
prisoners should not earn in gaol an average of
£7B a year, and female prisoners an average of
£52. Difficulties, of course, stand in the way,
but the main difficulty—the foolish idea that it is
better for the free worker to be taxed to main-
tain the man in gaol than to allow the prisoner
to work at a remunerative undertaking—is fast
disappearing. Probably, as a minor result of a
thorough reform of the industrial side of prison
life, the cost of wardership would materially
decrease. A prisoner doing useful work for his
family and himself would look at life from a
standpoint very different from that of the man
who is simply a caged animal. Another point
which Neitenstein’s report calls attention to is
the folly of the present system of dealing with
women offenders. Of the 2990 females received
under sentence in 1904, practically all were
vagrants, arrested for drunkenness or for infest-
irig the streets. And “more than half the
sentences did not exceed a week.” That
week would just about suffice to give a
zest to the next bout of immorality or
beer. Within its compass any serious attempt at
reformative work would be hopeless. The female
vagrant needs to be treated as a patient rather than
as a minor offender,, and shut up for a sufficiently
long time to cure her of the cravings which bring
her to infamy, and to teach her some useful occu-
pation. In many cases, probably, the patient
would prove incorrigible. When incorrigibility
was absolutely established, permanent imprison-
ment should follow. In very many other cases
women, who at present alternate between the
streets and the gaol; who are an eyesore on the
streets; an outrage as they are dragged, kicking
and squealing, to the police station ; and a sorry
' sight in theaeells suffering a few days of enforcer:
sobriety ai.fi cleanliness—would be reformed and
become useful members of society., Sane penal
reform would make quite a financial difference
not to speak of its social benefits. Probably jfe
Would, in time, reduce the gaol population by one
half; it would certainly allow of a big reduction
in the officials maintained to catch and sentence
criminals; and it would remove the burden of the
prisoner’s maintenance from the shoulders of the
community.
The “Paltry” Factory.
Dr. Liddell, M.H.R., a Freetrade person from
N.S.W., got on to the Immigration Restriction
law recently after this fashion
. Have you noticed how the population is degenerating
m the back-blocks ? Speaking from experience, I say wo
are rearing a class of people in our back-blocks who are
little better than blackfellows. . . , As a result of this
close community, we are producing a race of degenerates.
Walk the streets of Melbourne or Sydney at night and see
the undersized little mortals—the mere brats of boys and
girls who are to be fathers and mothers of future genera-
tions 1 _ What are we doing to assist them ? Simply-
bolstering up paltry factories of half-a-dozen men in
which these children are employed in what can only be
described as dens. Let us encourage immigrants to the
coun try—l don’t care whether they are Celts or foreigners
—British people, Italians, French or Germans—let us wel-
come them all, as long as they are good citizens and
capable of working. In this temperate zone, it is certain
that we cannot continue as we have been doing unless wo
are to eventually become anaemic, and produce a race of
degenerates.
Dr. Liddell has apparently four theories—at least
his yells suggest these four: —
(1) That the Immigration Restriction Act, passed about,
three years ago, is responsible for the alleged degeneracy
of people born 20 or more years before it was passed,
(2) That children ought to be born grown-up, and that
because the small children of Sydney and Melbourne are
small when they haven’t had time to grow bigger some-
thing is wrong
(3) That the “paltry” factory employing half-a-dozen
men is a thing to be scoffed at, while the paltry farm, run
by one man and his wife and his overworked infant, isn’t,
though on the farm, according to Liddell, people are

fellows.

The Bulletin has received a card from the
“National Democratic Party” (New England
Division) —a concern which asks no fees from its
members, and pushes the good work by the aid of
voluntary subscriptions only. The party has 14
principles:—
(1) Australia always first.
(2) Preference to Australian-made goods.
,(3) Abolition of State Governors and Upper Houses.
(4) Australian navv and citizen’s army for defence only.
(5) Abolition of titles of distinction.
(6) No Australians to take up arms unlJse for the defence
of Australia.
(7) All Australians to bind themselves to defend a White
Australia with arms if necessary.
(8) Discouragement of aliens and undesirables.
(9) Federal arsenal.
(10) Federal newspaper.
(11) Arbitration on all questions, and .the neutralisation
of Australia.
(12) Taking the country out of pawn and keeping it out.
(13) Coinage of silver.
(14) Absentee tax.
N.B.—Members will vote only for candidates who favor
these planks or a majority of them. In no case will a
member vote for a titled person.
The card comes in a red envelope bearing the
legend, “Learn to think Australian 1” It is re-
freshing to come across a society like this in a
blatant age, when the great ambition of the
loudest section in Australian politics is that this
country should “learn to think Nigger.”

There doesn’t seem to be any end to the Victorian
farm-landlord’s capacity fpr loafing bn the 'State,
what time he calls himself the backbone of the
country, and scornfully refers to the city factory-
worker as a parasite. It took some time for the
“parasite” to grasp the fact that the State had
borrowed £220,645 to lend to the farmers' at
Rodney (where the Kyabramapootra comes from,
and which Dunky Gillies used tb represent) arid
then wrote £149,949 off the debt. But 1 even
then the “parasite” didn’t know the self-
reliant country landlord’s full capacity tor cadg-
ing. An appendix, stuck at the back of the
annual report on Vic. Water Supply, furnishes
a “ return of water supplied to bodies free of charge
from Loan Works ” ; and this shows that last year
the irrigation trusts cadged 14,020,000,000 cubic feet
of water gratis for irrigation, stock, and .domestic
purposes, while waterworks trusts and Maljee
shires got another 6,590,000,090 cubic feet for
nothing. The last lot doesn’t matter so much ;
the poor devils who have been squeezed out into
the Mallee deserve pity mostly. But the other
huge lot of loafing was almost exclusively from the
Goulburn and Loddon works, which supply some
of the finest cocky-country in the State.
■ ♦
“ The State ” is the cow that always has to go into
the bail. “Owing to an ambiguous clause in the
Fire Brigades Act,” says N.S.W. Statistical
Register, “the fire insurarice co.’s and municipal
councils do not always consider themselves called
upon to contribute towards the expense of bri-
gades as defined by the Act.” So, in plenty of
places, the State has to hump the whole expense
—the expense of saving the country ratepayer’s
furniture and the house that the insurance co.
would have to pay for if it were burned down.
For instance, at Grafton neither insurance co. ’s
nor local ratepayers put up a penny last
year; the brigade cost £l5O to run, and the
State paid the whole of it. The same thing
happened at Hillgrove, Morpeth, Nowra, and
other places. And at Bega, Corowa, Dubbo,
Junee, Kiama, Lambton, Merewether, Stockton,
Tamworth, Tumut, Wellington, and Yass, among
others, the local municipalities didn’t pay a copper
—they simply loafed on the State for protection.
In other words, the city and suburban taxpayer
had to pay for his own protection, and the country
property-owner’s protection top. No wonder
anything thorough m the way of Local Governmen t
isn’t popular. The capacity of the country pro-
perty-owner for dodging taxation is a positive
fine art, and yet he can get himself passed off as
the backbone of the Commonwealth.

It takes a lot to make the Bendigo (Vic.) miner
kick, but some of him has almost plucked up the
courage to do it. He is groping now 4000 ft. down
below the surface, not in a shaft or a drive where
he can get a draught of pure, moderately cool air,
but in exploring winzes sunk from long prospect-
ing tunnels, or in the dead-ends of crosscuts, or
away in rises, put up in hot, steaming rock in
the chase after an “ indication ” —after something
that if it were chased far enough might turn into
a speck of gold. And in this dead, heavy atmo-
sphere he grinds out the rock, and the little hole
• in which he has to crouch to his work is filled with
; dust that gets cn to his lungs, and with fumes of

explosives that turn the stomach and split the
head. If he were working in a shallow drive with
plenty of air and room to move and breathe in, he
would only be asked to put in eight hours a day;
and his boss, who owns the hole he works in, pro-
bably reckons himself hard-driven if he puts in
six or seven hours in his office before he gets away
to his golf. And down there in his little hell the
deep-sinking miner works eight hours ; anyhow,
he puts in eight hours—there isn’t a man in 20
who could pushTiimself to do a solid eight hours’
toil under sucir conditions from week to week.
He simply must have his spell; and sometimes a
considerate co. leaves a pool of water at
the bottom of the shaft, where he may
go to cool-off. The Miners’ Association has a
rule that men shall only work six-hour
shifts in hot workings; but the man who goes into
a hot working generally goes there because he can’t
find anywhere else to go, and when he has been
there awhile there isn’t much kick left in him—
they could tell him that he would have to work
nine hours, and the chances are that about all the
protest he would make would be a hollow groan.
Still there are a few who know, and have started
to talk ; and a humble remonstrance is to be made
to the directors —Bendigo miners rarely get beyond
a humble remonstrance.

The landed section of Victoria’s House of Rich
Landlords fought tooth and nail against the clause
in the Water Bill which provides that the beds and
banks of all streams shall become vested in the
State. All the opponents of the clause quoted
England. The fact that England is a country
where it’s always raining, while Victoria is a
country where it sometimes doesn’t rain at
all, couldn’t be thumped into the gold-sodden
intellects of the land-gorged Tories. They
had got the land for nothing, or next to nothing,
and now they wanted to keep the water, which
they had grabbed at the same time. Yet,
after all, the Water Bill doesn’t propose to charge
Fat anything for the privilege of using the
streams. It says that the landlords can use them
as much as they like, but they can’t own them,
and, therefore, they can’t swindle the State with
huge compensation claims if it deepens a
river, or dams it, or irrigates with it. But
whatever Fat sees or uses he wants to own—
without paying for it, of course—and he couldn’t
be persuaded to part amicably with the rivers and
streams that he had no earthly right to grab.
Manifold, who owns a province out in the Western
District, where most of the good land is found,
lifted up his voice and wept when he saw that the
clause was going to be passed. “ It will be
a very bad day for this State,” he wailed,
“when a telegram goes to England to say
that Parliament has authorised confiscation.”
This pathetic ant, fussing in the sun, probably
quite believes that England takes an interest in
his agitation. But surely the Tory ant must
realise that he is overdoing it when he flourishes
this rusty old weapon on every small occasion.
It is impossible in Australia to try to make a land-
grabber decently honest, to make him pay his
taxes, to make him cease robbing the country over
irrigation swindles or any other swindles, without
him rising up to say that this will create a horrible
impression in England. This constant use of
England to back up steals and frauds will yet
make people tired of the very name of England.

A writer in Melbourne Herald gives a choice
account of the condition of affairs in that varie-
gated hell—S’Africa. Natal possesses at present
83,000 whites, 100,000 black natives, 80,000 Hindus,
and an assortment of Malays, Arabs, and mixed
lots. The Transvaal is nearly as spotted. Its
50,000 Chows were indented under a contract of
repatriation which will cost about £8 per head;
but, says he, “ Does any man in his senses believe
that within the next two years the mine-owners,
who still control everything, will not get this
repatriation condition annulled ? ” Dozens of
Australians live in S’Africa who dare not own to
their nationality ; and why ? Because the Aus-
tralian workmen are, of the whole empire, the
most bitterly opposed to Chinese labor; are the men
most familiar with and skilled in making use of
industrial and political organisation for the defence
of their rights; and are those from whom the mining
magnates would expect the bitterest opposition
to any repeal of the repatriation provisions. That
is why, especially in Natal, which depends on the
Transvaal, “no Australians need apply.” Yet
consider the politics of this blastiferous handful of
80,000 whites ! The Ministerial programme sub-
mitted to the Natal Parliament last May included
these items : Reduction in State expenditure from
£7,000,000 to £5,000,000; 10 per cent, reduction
in public servants’ salaries; a poll-tax of £1 on
every adult male in the colony, and an estimated
deficit at the end of the year of £200,000. Even
Carruthers would blush at that! Yet the im-
portation of Chow and Hindu labor still con-
tinues—it has become, as in all nigger-labor coun-
tries, a degradation for a white man to do manual
labor, and the Hindus have practically driven
him out of all retail trading businesses. Poor
S’ Africa!
Mrs. Hamilton Grey explains her objections to
the N.S.W. Neglected Children’s Bill: —
A child may be arrested with or without a warrant, on
the mere belief of an outsider that the child is “uncon-
trollable,” or “ neglected.” The Attorney-General, being
asked to explain the meaning of the word “ uncon-
trollable,” writes:—“ I carefully avoided attempting to
define the word ‘ uncontrollable.’ To give a compre-
hensive definition of the term is beyond human power.”
Yet on that term a child may be apprehended
with or without a warrant, kept awaiting a trial
in the Children’s Court, for 24 hours, away from
parents or friends—and, at the mere despotic will
of the Children’s Court Judge, may, on that vague
term, be committed to an institution or reformatory.
Should the child, smarting under a sense of injustice and
yearning for home ties, seek to return to his relatives or
friends, he can be “ put in gaol for three months, with
separate treatment as far as practicable,” and then re-
turned to the reformatory. Should any friend of the
child, or of the child’s parents, advise the withdrawal of
the child from State control, he may be gaoled for six
months for expressing an opinion. The appeal from the
decision of the Children’s Court is so restricted that it is
practically worthless ; yet the child is not even allowed
bail while an appeal to another court is pending. The
accused parent or child may not take solicitor or counsel
into the Children’s Court for the defence, and the power
of the magistrate is absolute. Why this eagerness to
arrest children on incomprehensive terms ? And why this
extreme care that all the proceedings, even the appeals
from the Children’s Courts, should be so jealously guarded
from public censure ? “The heart of innocence is bold,”
and justice has no cause to fear public opinion.
♦
The N.S.W. public has lately been much afflicted
with a thin pamphlet issued by the “ People’s
Reform League,” in which it is pointed out that
the duty of every citizen is to vote, and which
incidentally asks for Is. subscription. The thin
pamphlet is grieved because, at the last Federal
elections, only 292,246 electors of N.S.W. voted,
leaving 394,593 unaccounted for. In its pomp and
pride the League assumes that all these 394,593
stayed away from the poll owing to “ apathy,”
and takes no notice of the large possibility that
250,000 of them stayed away because the nomina-
tions in their electorates gave them a choice
between a knave and a fool, or a fossil and a
bigot. There should be a negative vote whereby
the voter can declare that he objects to all the
candidates, and when the negative vote tops the
poll there should be a new election, and all the
candidates at the first poll should be disqualified.
If under this system the voters still stayed away,
there would be some reason in the cry of the
League’s thin pamphlet about the “ apathy of the
electors.” At present the trouble probably often
arises through the disgust of the electors.

The motor-man from Wentworth (N.S.W.) is
accepted as the wag of the House of Representa-
tives. Playing up to the part, he quite surpassed
all previous efforts in his motion to double Aus-
tralia’s naval tribute to Great Britain. Taking
immense pains, and after great research, he proved
that, year by year, the British fleet would become
less and less able to blockade European fleets in
western waters, and that, therefore, all British
battleships were being withdrawn to Europe,
leaving Australia at the mercy of any assailant.
Having proved this to the hilt, he cheerfully
besought his audience to double the existing sub-
sidy, not to secure double the defence, nor to
secure any defence—for, with engaging candor, he
admitted that £400,000 made as little difference
to Britain as £2oo,ooo—but, as he said, “in
order to call attention to the subject.” The
spending of £400,000 a year to “call atten-
tion to the subject” seems a little stiff. In-
stead of providing a naval defence Kelly’s theory
is that Australia should pay £400,000 a year to
draw attention to the absence of defence. The
Bulletin would gladly draw attention to the
absence of Kelly for 1 per cent, of that sum,

Looking at it all round, “Elizabeth” is
the best thing to date of the Nance O’Neil season
at Her Majesty’s, Sydney. Most historical dramas
are shocking travesties, but this one gets reason-
ably close to the histories. Lying was a very fine
art in the days when the best liar kept his head
longest, as a rule, and therefore it isn’t possible
to say how close the histories of the period get to
the facts; but, at any rate, the historian and the
dramatist have managed to give much the same
sort of general impression of the large, red fury
who raged on England’s throne for 45 years.
The drama certainly pushes Robert of Essex
too far into the front, and gives him a
better character than he deserves. Still,
there had to be a love-interest in the
business somewhere, and, though Bess spent
a good part of her life pretending that she
was seriously thinking about a wedding, her little
affair with Essex was almost the only one in which
there seems to have been any real sentiment on
her part. Essex himself seems to have made
the proceedings look as little ridiculous as could
be expected when a man of 25 pretends to mash a
violent lady of 59. So Essex is turned into some
sort of a hero. And being the hero, his warts
had to be left out of the picture ; it wouldn’t do
to show him up as a braggart, and as a person
who in the end turned rusty because he wasn’t
making such a good thing out of his bleeding
country as he used to, and finally lost his head
because the telephone hadn’t been laid on between
the Queen’s apartments and the Tower, wherefore
her changeable, tempestuous Majesty couldn’t
countermand the order for his execution until it was
too late. But that Essex has been given too
copious a coat of whitewash isn’t John Glendin-
ning’s fault; his fault is that he sometimes forgets
that he isn’t still playing the Laird, in
“ Trilby,” and so makes Essex talk to the
Queen in Scotch. For all that, he carries
through with great credit the warm scene in
the throne room, leading up to the famous oc-
casion when the lady got half off her
throne to box his ears, and did it with a hand that
is said to have practised on her maids. Miss
O’Neil herself rages through five acts with all her
old success ; in a lighter vein she simultaneously
dictates the two letters, one in her character of
eagle, the other in her character of butterfly, with
some fine touches ; and she fails only in represent-
ing the 70-year-old woman, with most of the fires
burned out, as a much younger volcano than she
must have looked by that time. Gaston Mervale
has the heavy, sombre part of Burleigh. His
Svengali had just been getting great praise, and
his Burleigh, in which he does just as good work,
is hardly mentioned. The fact is Svengali looks a
tremendously difficult part to play, and isn’t; or, at
any rate, the representation can be full of flaws,
and the weird make-up and the eccentricities of
the character hide them. Burleigh kept his place
beside Elizabeth almost wholly by virtue of his
brains, and wore nothing conspicuous in the way
of clothes, and when he couldn’t talk sense rarely
talked anything; and there isn’t much extraneous
help to be got out of that sort of character. Most
of the others do nothing in particular except
show the sort of clothes people wore 300 years ago,
and they do that very well, and the stage-carpenter
and the rest who built the throne-room gave them
valuable assistance.

“In Town,” at Sydney Palace, has had a
phenomenal success for an amateur show, and has
gathered in full houses every night. When
the piece goes off it will have been a nine
days’ wonder. Mr. Philip Lytton must feel
like getting a statue of himself erected on a hill
by public subscription. One night Mr. Hubert
Lewis’ voice—owing, no doubt, to the toil of
responding to encores, failed—but a sympathetic
gathering applauded even the failure, and it takes
good management to get an audience into that
frame of mind. .

There are three very good things about
“Beauty and the Barge,” at Sydney Criterion.
Its name is a triumph of artfulness, and almost
alone would lure an audience into a theatre, and
into the belief that it was getting all that was due
to it. Then there are the play’s scenic beauties,
and finally its Bargee, who is Mr. Brough.
Judging from the reception Sydney first-
nighters gave the farce, it must either be quite
full of very good things or every Jack and Jill in
the auditorium had won largely that day—the last
day of the Spring races. This writer was never
previously caught in 3uch a gale of laughter in every
key. The kind of laughter that is like the
clapping together of two slates predominated,
but all the people in Sydney with a highly
developed sense of farcical humor must have
been present. “Beauty and the Barge” leaves
a memory of a silly, affable old skipper
whose instinct of love-making is as much part of
his make-up as is his rolling gait; a horde
of harmless sailors who drain pint-pots in
a bar-room, and always have pipes stick-
ing out from their hairy countenances ; and an
amorous, elderly housekeeper. The love affairs of
a young lady and a gentleman who is a naval
officer make the idyll of the piece. Miss
Bessie Major is responsible, next to Mr.
Brough, for the fun. Miss Emma Temple as a
yellow-haired barmaid, with a huge buckle in the
yellow, is immense. Miss Winifred Fraser and
Miss Gordon Lee play the two carefully brought-
up, but skittish, maidens in a pretty little fashion
that reminds one of mice at a game of hide-and-
seek. Carter Pickford, as the naval man, does
very little, but does it in a gentlemanly way, and
manages his extraordinarily long and slender legs
as gracefully as if he were a daddy-long-limbs.
“ Beauty and the Barge ” will sail together up the
gloriously-painted Thames until further notice.

“ Between Two Women,” a dozen or so
murders, and a caged maniac kept by the villainess
to give thrill to _ the business of assassination by
carving her victims up into small pieces to slow
music, Sydney Royal had no lack of sensations
last Saturday night. The piece reeks with blood
and sobs with strangulation from beginning to
end, and by the time the virtuous English earl’s
son has married for keeps the virtuous English
woman named Violet, and foiled all the machina-
tions and marriage certificates of the wicked
foreign woman named Carmen, and the cur-
tain has dropped, a sated audience couldn’t
be further moved if one of the characters
were disembowelled by an octopus. Shows of
this kind come very close to the horrors of the
gladiatorial circus. True, the blood and the
struggles are not real. But the effort is to simu-
late reality as closely as possible, and the player
who scores the most horror is counted the most
successful. It is only fair to say that this ten-
dency to gain a cheap effect by ghastliness is not
confined to Mr. Anderson’s management. On a
recent visit to Sydney Miss Nance O’Neil, playing
Nancy in an adaptation from Dickens, thought
fit to show to the audience in the last scene a
cleverly made-up and most repellent imitation of
a bashed face, a thing, apparently, of blood and
wreck and bruises. That is not dramatic art.
The prize-ring is the proper place—if there is any
—for its display.
* * * #
The company bears up under its burden
of horrors with courage. The leading parts are
well taken by Miss Duggan, Miss Guildford,
C. R. Stanford, and George Cross. And when
the blood is not flowing Bert Bailey, as the
comedy man, rouses the frequent laugh that
sometimes shows the vacant mind.

It is satisfactory to hear that manager
William Anderson intends to make a bid for
higher success than “The Face at the Window”
or “ Rescued in Senegambia by the Brass Band.”
Early next month he will stage, at Sydney Royal,
an Australian melodrama, by Ambrose Pratt and
A. S. Joseph, entitled “Three Days With
Thunderbolt-”_ It is a bushranging story, but it is
said to be a thing of some merit, and, judging by
the calibre of the writers, the treatment should be
effective. The Anderson co. is an excellent one,
but it rarely gets work to do up to its capacity.
It deserves a better type of play, and in any case
the production of home-made melodrama should
be encouraged. There is plenty of good local
material available, and the supply of British
material for “shockers” seems to be failing,
judging by the crude efforts of imagination which
come from London these days.

Except that some flickergraph pictures of

the Tivoli bill continues the same extra-varied bill
that it was when the oil of praise was poured over
it last week.

Adelaide is an unusually lively city these
times. ■ Nellie Stewart has come to the Royal
with “Pretty Peggy” ; other plays old and new
to follow. The Gilbert and Sullivan Co. has
moved on, after filling up its last nights with
“Pinafore,” stretched out by a Refined Variety
Entertainment. (“Pinafore” was never meant
to play a whole evening.) “The Yeoman
of the Guard ” gave H. H. Wallace the
chance which every comedian loves to get —
his heart broken and expire in agony for a
change. Sheridan at the Tivoli has won the
Melbourne Cup for the last time, and Mrs.
Dooley has made way for the “Lady Slavey.”
Also, the Town Hall has been seized upon by the
head half of the Westminster Glee Party, that
body having divided itself like a centipede, and
the tail half having progressed in another direc-
tion. Then the Live Stock Show has worked
off its extra vigor in evening concerts, and
Hyland’s Circus has produced much fiery tamed
horse, and the Ice Rink has bloomed out in car-
nivals.
“ Woman’s Hate,” revived at Melbourne
Royal last Saturday, proves the thorough respec-
tability of the late Henry Pettitt as a melodrama
writer. Compared with the ordinary domestic
“thrillers” of more recent birth, “A Woman’s
Revenge”—re-christened “Woman’s Hate” be-
cause the author is dead and can’t object—has a
sturdy literary way of expressing itself. The
plot is neatly woven, and the dialogue repays
Bland Holt’s people for their trouble in suiting the
action to the word and vice verm. This is one of
the cases in which they unanimously act for all
they are worth and throw out their lines to catch
the approval of a more or less discerning public.
With the exception of Miss Harrie Ireland (a
wicked adventuress who helps to make the pace
but soon drops out of sight) all the members of
the co. appear in the criminal court in the last act.
Miss Ross is the innocent prisoner in the dock ;
barrister Baker is counsel for the defence (a man
can’t defend his own wife against a charge of mur-
der, except in melodrama); Bland Holt is the
jaunty witness who shunts the awful crime to_ the
account of Styan; and Albert Norman’s sin-stained
corpse represents the crime. Mrs. Holt and Miss
Pollock are nicely-spoken friends of the prisoner,
the learned judge is named Kemp, and there are
12 jurymen of somewhat bloodthirsty aspect. Also
Little Mary figures in the witness-box. Miss F.
Kelly impersonates Mary with more dramatic
force than seems natural to one so allegedly
young, but her assumption of juvenility is, never-
theless, a clever feature of a very well-treated
show.

At Melbourne Princess’s a scandalised
chambermaid will throw her pillows after “ The
J.P.” for two more nights. On Saturday the
Knight-Jeffries co. is to reappear with _ the
intention of producing itself in several pieces
during a brief season. It will appear, however, in
only one piece at a time, and the bill for Saturday
is a costume drama—“ His Majesty’s Servant ”
the story whereof shows how somebody’s “ready
sword flamed red in the loyal service of our Merry
Monarch in the deathless days of Roundhead and
Cavalier.” Julius Knight will impersonate the
flaming red swordsman who saves Miss Jeffries
from the clutches of “Noll’s damned troopers.”
But surely the d—d troopers had lost their Noll
ere Charles 11. began to be monarchically merry.
The managerial outline of the plot is bewildering.

“The Cingalee ” is running until further

The present vaudeville entertainment at
Melb. Opera House is the brightest since Rickards
ever was. Early last week the Jackson family
came to the rescue of an enfeebled programme,
and concerning those four brethren and sistern it
is only necessary to say that they are more admir-
ably Jacksonian than of yore. They play the
same instruments with improved art, whilst the
decorative presence of the girls is a handsome con-
tribution to the family effect. On Saturday the
programme was further strengthened. A. G.
Spry, a little man who has a natural tendency to be
funny, came to take the head of the comic song
deparlThent, which is a minor branch of the
business just now. The older turns were crowded
into the rear by Le Roy, Talma and Bosco, con-
juring comedians and magicians extraordinary.
For half an hour the Triumvirate provide a rush
of miracles, working together on a mixed mysti-
fication system, except when Talma, the lady of
the party, is engaged in coining silver dollars.
What Allan Shaw does with coins is done with,
?erhaps, greater rapidity in .a feminine manner by
'alma. When all the performers, plus assistants,
are distracting attention from one another the
show bristles with surprises. Le Roy plays
the serious magician, ordained by Lucifer
himself; Talma takes herself smilingly, and Bosco
is the buffoon. If Bosco finds a live rabbit in the
hat he divides it into two live rabbits. Le Roy
and Talma introduce the most elaborate of the
Davenport cabinet tricks at a hurricane pace, and
finally the stage is populated with birds of magni-
tude that apparently grew on the spot. In the
art of raising poultry by hand these festive
magicians are supreme. Having shaken numerous

We would wink a wicked eye at the abbreviated
frock
That covers Mary—Little Mary.
Her depth of worldly knowledge it were difficult
to gauge,
Her voice is rather mellow for a girl of tender age;
0, the most impressive youngster ever seen upon
the stage
Is Little Mary.
Mary, Mary, butter from a dairy
Wouldn’t melt within the mouth of such a fairy.
For an air of innocence,
Which is utterly intense,
We must give the bun to Little Mary.

geese, ducks, roosters, and one tall, ruminative

Talking of magicians, the rival Thurston
continues to create water nymphs at the Athenaeum
Hall, and if competition is the soul of business
the last week of that amazing stranger will find
him still going strongly, in accordance with the
advt. Thurston threatens to pass out of Mel-
bourne notice at the end of the month. He will
turn himself into the Adelaide express, and vanish
like a dream.

Maggie Stirling, supported by a violiniste
and a pianist, is to give her first concert at Mel-
bourne Town Hall to-night (Thursday). The
Mayor has formally received Madame Maggie,
the Musicians have welcomed her, the Press has
given her its warmest blessing, and the Public are
betraying a natural anxiety to hear her warble
once again and oftener. Five concerts, including
a matinee, will transpire within the week.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“O’Fipp”: As a serai-apropos appendix to recent cat
pars in “Poverty Point,” let me remark that the best
stage-cat I have ever seen was Harry Shine. His first
Australian part was the Cat in “Dick Whittington, ” when
Coppin opened the refurbished Royal in 1890.
At three Melbourne theatres lately nice girls were
imploring members of the audience to—
“ Come —come—come and make eyes at me
Down at the old Bull and Bush !
Come—come—come and have a glass with me
Down at the old Bull and Bush ! ”
Many would be glad to accept the invitation, but
the old B. and B. is so far away—something like 14,000
miles. Why not make it some local hostelry ? Austra-
lians are growing deadly tired of hearing several songs in
one night concerning the charms of “Romano’s in the
Strand,” the Elephant Hotel, and other Cold Country
drinkeries.
Johnny Dallas, comedian of Meynell’s new comedy co., is
as full of stories as a New York sky-scraper. He came over
on the mail-boat with Archbishop O’Reily, of Adelaide, and
one evening, not noticing the old man in the smoking-
room, related one of his best yarns. A hush, inexplicable
to Dallas, fell over the assemblage. Then the arch, arose,
pointed the finger of Holy Church at him, and ordered
him a week’s penance. Dallas, who was one time big in
the English athletic world, is now, like most retired
athletes, big in circumference. When still some pounds
heavier, he played the part of Queen Elizabeth in a Gaiety
burlesque, and the inference which London Daily Mail
drew from his figure was a grievous insult to the Throne
and Person. Dallas’s athletic record includes running,
boxing, swimming, and three Humane Society Medals
for saving people from drowning. The last person he
saved was a youngster who fell from the Thames embank-
ment. When Dallas got him out, he found that the
enthusiastic crowd had got away with his coat and vest
and all that in them was. Dallas gave up life-saving after
that, and now sticks to ordinary comedy.
James B. Atholwood, character actor, now with the
Tittell Brune co., is an ex-tinsmith, and before he quite
got out of the habit of being a respectable tradesman, he
was continually making unnecessary implements. When-
ever a spectacular piece was to be played, Atholwood
tried to persuade the stage manager to let him make the
battle-scene armor. Failing this, he generally made his
own armor—very successfully, too.
“ T.D.”: Melba will have to sing more frequently if she
means to keep her position as top vocalist in London.
During the Oovent Garden season just closed the very
independent Nellie was heard only three or four times,
and it was noticeable that at these times the public did
not rush in greater numbers than when tenor Caruso was
the bright particular star. The fact that Melba is not
singing means, of course, that other sopranos must take
her place, and this season has been specially dangerous
for her in this respect, revealing Selma Kurz, of Vienna, a
singer with fuller tone and just as artistic trilling powers.
Also, a young girl from Canada, calling herself by the
fearsome name of Donalda, showed a brilliant voice which
is on the right track and only needs to mellow a bit. On
the other hand, the former Melbourne critic who once
wrote amusingly about Melba’s “wonderful white voice”
and didn’t know that the phrase “white voice” was
loaded, from a singer’s point of view, would have ample
justification for his remark now. Melba is retaining her
girlishness of voice to such an extent that she sometimes
sounds like that of a prim Sunday school maiden singing
for a prize copy of “ Stepping Heavenward ” presented by
an anaemic vicar.
Apropos Thurston. Certain wizards : Anderson, Ber-
tram, Blitz, Bosco, Dante, Dodler, Frikell, Haselmayer,
Heller, Hercat, Hertz, Hermann, Houdin, Jacobs, Keiler,
Lynn, Maskelyne, Philippe, Robin, Stodare, Sylvester.
Robert Brough’s proposal that mummers should charge
a fee for their autographs looks like a scheme to levy an
insidious tax on the vanity of the profession. The fees
are to go to a charity, so that there will be a certain
publicity and advertisement about the business, and the
mummer who is never asked for his autograph will have
to pay the money out of his own pocket and pretend there
is a rush upon him.
Seven Australians figure on the list of musical artists
engaged for the autumn promenade concerts under Henry
J. Wood at the Queen’s Hall, London. Singers who can
manage to get into these concerts, under the virile and
musicianly Wood, are considered no “ slouches ” at their
business, and it is possible to spend years trying to get in.
The Australians engaged are Mary Conly, Esta D’Argo
(Hetty Holroyd), Violet Ludlow, Maud Dalrymple, Eva
Mylott, Walter Kirby, and Percy Grainger. The stately
Maud Dalrymple thus gets her first big London show.
“O.”: Members of touring theatrical co.’s are expected
to work for their money sometimes. I received a letter re-
cently asking me to engage a man to play small parts,
look after the scenery and baggage, set the stage, play
the piano when required, sing songs in the intervals,
help in the front of the house, and paint stands (posters),
and all for 30s. a week. The manager (he was a stranger
to me except by name, and didn’t offer anything for my
trouble unless he expected me to take commission out of
30s. a week) kindly said he would pay the fare to the town
where the co. was then playing “The Blighted Ghost.”
I wrote that if he would accept a £5 premium and allow
the new man to pay his own fare, I might secure someone,
but otherwise people would look on his offer as too good
to be true.
“Snell”: In its determination to do the thing well
the “London Lives” Dramatic Co. introduced a real
donkey into its performance of the thrilling melodrama,
London Lives,” in a western district (Vic.) township
recently. The comic coster is a popular feature of
“London Lives,” and Stiggs, the low comedian, had a
“hooroo” reception when he rode into a love scene
between the hero and the heroine, a pale yellow lady
with a lisp, perched on the extreme end of the despised
animal with the bray. The animal ate a morsel of carrot
from the tiny hand of the gentle lady with commendable
reserve, but when it was time for him to exit he forgot
his cue, or labored under the delusion that there was
more carrot in his part, and refused to budge. The low
comedian, pretending that the situation was not serious,
argued with Neddy in a humorous vein, but the tall hero
and the pale, golden heroine, being unable to sustain an
air of convincing repose, blundered on with their
affecting amours exactly as if the ass were not planted
in the middle of the stage, with his four legs
spread and his tail projecting like a pan-handle,
stupidly resisting the blandishments of Stiggs. The
comedian’s temper forsook him, and he kicked Neddy
in the barrel, and called him an ignominious name,
whereat Edward backed ignominiously into the stile, and
pushed it over, and trampled down about two acres of
cornfield. Then he went straight at the heroine in quest
of carrot, and coursed the beautiful lady three times
round the stage, towing Stiggs after him. The stage-
manager blasphemed in the wings, and the hero, in his
confusion, went on with his part on his own, making rap-
turous speeches to the atmosphere, while the audience
screamed with ill-advised merriment. Neddy pushed his
nose over the screaming heroine, prospecting for vege-
tables. The manager and two stage-hands dashed to the
rescue, and the curtain fell on a cloud of dust, in the
middle of which Neddy and several angry people strug-
gled desperately. The audience continued to hear hoarse
curses and the rattle of hoofs, and presently the back end
of the donkey came clean through the curtain, and
slowly Edward emerged, dragging Stiggs, and the hero,
and the stage-manager after him. Then some support
broke, and the donkej’’ slid into the orchestra on top of
the young man who was playing the piano loudly in the
hope of diverting public attention from the disaster.
When Neddy got off the young man, the latter was no
longer fit for use, and the ass himself had lost what little
judgment remained to him prior to the previous catas-
trophe. In three minutes Edward had kicked the
audience from the ground floor out into the night. At
this point Stiggs stunned Edward by hitting him on the
neck with a clothes prop, and the wretched animal was
dragged out by the tail. Then “ London Lives ” resumed
its comparatively mild career.
Something definite is at last to be heard of Amy Castles,
who, after a recent visit to London, has secured a few en-
gagements in that village. Amy will sing during the
coming winter season. The writer has heard many absurd
yarns as to Miss Castles’ voice, and the reasons for with-
holding herself from the public gaze for so long, but he
has had the chance of hearing her sing privately, and he
can testify that her voice is O.K.—that, in fact, there are
not half-a-dozen voices knocking about Europe which are
more O.K. than hers ; also that her operatic repertoire
would be a credit to any singer ten years older, and that
when she chooses to sing, nothing can stop her. The ab-
surd yarns mentioned above come from people who don’t
understand the very beginning of what is necessary for a
singer’s career. While a blacksmith or a shoemaker spends
five or seven years at his apprenticship, a good many ig-
norant people expect a singer to know everything, from the
common scale to the Wagnerian cycle, in 18 months. Amy
Castles has, after all, been less than five years at her
actual work in Paris, she had to unlearn all that she was
taught in her first year, she could afford to wait, and she
is still in the early twenties. Of course, she wished
for operatic work, but it is now understood that she is
starting with concerts. Anyone who knows what the
European opera conditions are can quite understand this.
The prima donna usually obtains her position by pay-
ments either in cash or kind, and it’s the easiest thing in
the world to get three or four appearances at some famous
opera house if you’ve got the money.
Boxy Barton’s dainty style takes London critics. She
appeared with F. R. Benson’s repertoire co., at the
Adelphi, in a recent revival of “ The Comedy of Errors.”
Most members of the cast treated the play in rather too
rollicking a style to please the Times man, who remarked
that “ the elegant Lesbia of Miss Roxy Barton—a First
Empire figure, a Madame RCcamier —seems a bit out of
place in this football scrimmage.” Those who remember
the charming portrait of Madame Recamier in Melbourne
National Gallery will realise how complimentary the Times
meant to be.
“T.D.”: Irving, now said by London doctors to be
gradually dying in harness, is still a lesson to Cockney
actordom. Nowadays he only plays parts like Becket or
Shylock, in which rapid movement is not essential, but
there is a passionate force and dignity about the old man
that you do not get in any other English mummer. I
went to have my first shillingsworth of Irving as a matter
of sheer duty, and with a possible desire to be able to
brag later on that I had seen that idol fretting his hour
upon the stage. I had been convinced for years before-
hand that my shilling would only result in a vision of a
lean and slippered pantaloon tearing a toothless passion
to shreds, writhing in grotesque mannerisms, and mouth-
ing inaudible blank verse. Instead, I found Irving the
only sound elocutionist and the only vital and absolutely
convincing actor that London has to show for itself. He
is its one prominent survival of the old ‘ ‘ stock ” school. It
was not given to Irving to walk on to a West-end
stage as a pretty young .man, and be carefully coached
by a stage manager as to his exact inflection of speech
and the precise position that he should assume at any
given moment. That is the way young fellows go on the
stage in London nowadays, generally paying a pretty
solid cash consideration for the appearance. When the
play peters out, and they wish to find a fresh “shop”
nobody will have them, because they don’t know the
beginnings of the mumming game, and they drop out
perforce, and make room for some other mug with a little
money to spend in being instructed by a stage manager
as to the particular plank he must stand on when the
heroine shrieks “What is to become of my cheeild ! ”
Open the Era, and you’ll find scores of people “resting”
for months at a stretch —people who have, at one time or
other, played big parts in leading London playhouses,
and scraped through because they scrupulously obeyed
the stage-manager and didn’t try to put any individuality
into the alleged acting.
“O’Fipp”: What a gift of expression some of the old
dramatists had ! “Omar” Fitzgerald remarks in one of
his letters —“ You must listen, or I should feel like the
fine lady in one of Vanbrugh’s plays : ‘ Oh, my God, that
you won’t listen to a woman of quality when her heart is
bursting with malice 1’ ” Then there are those really
artistic oaths in Congreve’s “ Double Dealer ” and “ Love
for Love.” Our Barries and Sutros provide nothing to
rival them. If we can’t have Congreve or Vanbrugh on
the Australian stage, how about a new drama, “ Bullocky
Bill, the Cattle King,” with an exhibition of ground and
lofty cussing in the second act, when Bill’s team gets
bogged in a watercourse ?
Edward Terry relates that he made his first appearance
as Myles na Ooppaleen in “ The Colleen Bawn,” produced
by a touring company of four men, three women, and a
boy. “The stage was a flimsy structure of planks on
trestles. The cave scene was reckoned to produce a great
effect. A table and chair were placed right and left to
represent rocks, and a plank was removed from the centre
for Myles to dive through. Myles got on his chair (sup-
posed to be a rook) and spoke his piece. Danny Mann,
habited in a colonel’s undress frock-coat, came with Eily
on to the table (supposed to be the other rock), and on
her refusal of the marriage lines, he threw her into the
gauze waters. Myles attempted to fire his gun ; it
missed, but Danny fell, shouting ‘ I’m shot! I’m shot! ’
Myles then discovered Eily drowning in the gauze, pulled
off his hat (his wig coming off with it in his excitement),
and dived head first on to the floor of the hall, nearly
breaking his neck. But he pulled Eily out, and, standing
up with his head out of the hole in the stage, he bellowed
‘Saved!’” After the performance the manager con-
gratulated Terry, and rewarded him wfith no less than
eighteenpence.
On good authority it is stated that the singing and
recitation tournaments which happen all over Melbourne
and throughout Victoria are responsible for a shocking
growth of envy, hatred and malice among the swollen-
headed young competitors. It is quite a common thing
for a singer, piano-thumper, or spouter who has done a
“ turn” and quitted the platform, to retire to the back of
the hall and hiss rival performers as they come along,
consequently the amateurs who come latest are likely to
receive the most hisses. As for the parents and friends of
the youngsters, they form themselves into mean-spirited
cliques, barracking for their respective candidates, and
regarding all the others with cold disdain. The A.N.A.
idea in starting these prize-battles was to promote a brave
spirit of emulation. The result has been to create a
rising generation of spiteful stage-strucklings, and a
scandalous system of favoritism in the awarding of prizes.
The great actor man was present at an expensive ball in
Melbourne, but he did not dance, partly because he is
scant of wind, but mainly because he dances so much like
a wounded bear that the honor of whirling with the
tremendous personage is discounted by the accompany-
ing misery. He stood round instead, and struck impres-
sive pose% as if under the great strain of being photo-
graphed continuously. This was kept up for so long that
even the dullest sense of the ridiculous was stirred, and
then came the youthful guest who had imbibed unwisely
and well. He advanced upon the attitudinising actor,
and seized his hand, and shook it warmly, and said
earnestly: “God blesh you, ol’ f’ler—Gor blesh you!
You’ve given us a beautiful ball. We’re all grateful. We
thank you heartily f’r your hoshpitality.” He went away
leaving the actor thinking in a pale tone of voice. But the
mummer had hardly worked up another statuesque pose
than the youthful guest, primed with a little more wine,
rushed up and spoke : “Shplendid city thish you’ve got,”
he said thickly. “Congratulate you on the way you’ve
built it. Great sucksesh.” Then he gave the mummer
ten minutes rest, at the end of which time he re-appeared
looking wild. “ Ole f’ler,” he said impressively, “sphlendid
universh thish. Musht have taken you an awful lot o’
time an’ hard worksh. Jusht been readin’ how you did it
in Genesish.” Then a tall figure disappeared down the
stair.
In the Gilbert and Sullivan Repertoire Co. the mother
of one of the performers flits about in the chorus. Which
reminds The Bulletin of a Sydney “financial agent”
who has his father as office boy.
Madame Anita Sutherland, of the Melbourne Conserva-
torium, expresses the opinion that baritones are far more
brainy than tenors. Jackson, madame’s hubby, is a
baritone.
“Melb.”: Anent Thurston and wizards. The first
wizard of importance here was Jacobs, who, with his cele-
brated man Sprightly, opened the Olympic Theatre (Iron
Pot) for Coppin in 1885. The yarn goes that Jacobs once
spoilt a gentleman’s belltopper by making an omelette in
it, before the audience. He added insult to injury by
refusing to pay. The gentleman summoned him. Jacobs
did the trick in the witness box, and restored the hat all
right. After him there came Anderson to Australia. At
his farewell London performance in Covent Garden, end-
ing with a bal masquO, the theatre wa- burnt down.
“Melb.”: A word more on the row between Coppin
and Miss Fanny Cathcart—Mrs. Heir. There was a
ferocious newspaper controversy in the Argus. Brooke
wrote at great length on the exquisite cruelty of Mrs.
Heir in breaking her professional engagement with him.
(Marriage cancels everything, if a lady chooses.) Heir
retorted at equal length with accounts of Coppin’s perse-
cution, his “unwelcome addresses,” and so on. The
Heirs left Coppin’s Olympic for the Royal. The public
furiously took sides. Suddenly the quarrel was made up.
Monster houses ! People said : “ Aha ! the Artful Dodger
again ! ” What a squeeze there was to see the play of
“The Honeymoon,” with Brooke as the Duke, Coppin as
the Mock Duke, Heir as Rolando, and Mrs. Heir as
Juliana ! But who’s the ghoul that raked up the love
letters of Coppin and Miss Cathcart ?
A chorus girl in London has been awarded £B5 damages
against a theatrical manager for injury to her health
caused by wearing damp tights. She gave evidence that
she and others of the chorus complained of the tights
being damp, and were told : “ I suppose they want to go
on naked. They must wear them.” In consequence of
wearing damp tights she had suffered from a bad cold.
A newly-issued book on animal-taming, by Frank
Bostock, one of the leading professors, is instructive.
Capt. Bonavita appears in the caged ring, in America,
with 27 performing lions at once. Lions, tigers, jaguars,
panthers, and leopards can never be trusted to wait their
particular turns lying on the ground in a big ring. They
will spring on the trainer. No such wild animals are ever
really trained. While waiting their turns in a ring they
must sit on pedestals, from which they never spring.
Bonavita has had 50 bad accidents, yet comes up smiling,
Bostock says he himself is tattooed all over with marks,
especially from claws. Weedon, an eminent trainer,
has been savaged time after time by his favorite
tigress, Goldie. Performing with tigers and members of
the leopard tribe is far more difficult than with lions.
Madame Morelli, a little Frenchwoman, is an amazement
to the profession, inasmuch as she appears with two
leopards, two panthers, and a jaguar all at once. She
must keep them all in front. Her special crawly bit is to
have a jaguar on a horizontal pole, looking into her eyes.
The lace of her dress touched a panther’s nose, and the
beast flew straight at her. Madame Pianka took a
bouquet of red roses into the ring for her performance
with four lions. One flew at it, thinking it was meat, and
his claw tore her badly, but she went on. Mdlle. Aurora’s
performance with five white bears in quite unique. A
lion escaped from Bostock’s circus at Birmingham and
got into the sewers, where he made more sensation than
the Tantanoola tiger.
There has been trouble between two corner men in a
Fijian variety show. Endman Dash purchased from
a representative Samoan poet a parody on a popular
air. Endman Blank was sent On to another place by the
management, and immediately started singing the parody
for wbich Dash had paid the poet. The song had refer-
ence to beer and burnt cigars, and was a great success.
When the rightful owner of the thing came along, he
found that the beer was stale and the burnt cigars were
strewn all over the island. At first he decided to kill his
brother, but on further consideration he concluded he
would only disfigure him for life. After pondering over
the size of the plagiarist, and his reputation for waving a
dirty left, Dash further reduced the punishment to
Christian remonstrance. In the end he didn’t even re-
monstrate, but let the matter drop. But so very few
artists, either in Honolulu or the New Hebrides, pay for
songs about beer and dead cigars that those who do
should be protected from conduct like that of Blank.
A point that the decession push— if there is such
a push—in N.S.W. seems to overlook is that,
supposing N.S.W. did secede from the Common-
wealth, it would probably break away as a very
much reduced State. Apart from civil war, which
is out of the question, no secession is possible
without an amendment of the Constitution, and
in making the amendment it would certainly be
provided that any district of the State which did
not want to secede might remain in the Common-
wealth. If the right of N.S.W. to break away
from the rest of Australia were admitted, the
equally solid right of Riverina or New England or
the West to break away from N.S. W. must logically
be admitted also. It is ten chances to one against
a majority being secured for secession anywhere,
but even if the almost impossible happened, and
such a majority were secured in some districts, the
seceding State would hardly consist of more than
Sydney and a few miles of surrounding country.
Certainly Riverina would never return voluntarily
to the exclusive domination of the Foreign-trade
clique in Sydney ; nor would New England ; nor
much of the country west of the Blue Mountains.
It would be the case of Virginia over again. Vir-
ginia split in two over the question of secession,
and even when the remnant of the original State
came back into the Union, it never recovered its
lost territory or became the great, dominant, arro-
gant Virginia of olden days. Virginia, by the
way, made it a condition of joining Jeff Davis’
new Commonwealth that the Confederate capital
should be in its territory, which reads like a co-
incidence.
Queensland’s new, gorgeous Lands offices are
now open. The cost is set down at nearly
£200,000, and it was one of Philp’s jobs. There
is a little irony in the fact that the spendthrifts
disappeared from responsibility long before occu-
pancy was possible, and Arthur Morgan, the
man who. has set his face against extravagance,
was the first to ministerially occupy the suite of
rooms set apart for the Premier. The millionaire-
like Council Chamber (with heavy wainscoting
of polished cedar, and lofty indented ceilings)
looks out on to a garden reserve, flanked by
a wide balcony, and columned on the outer edges
with massive stone pillars. The messengers’
rooms are far more spacious than those occupied
by Ministers in other Departments. The great
vestibules and the wide halls lead the way
to apartments, many of which would give
dancing room to hundreds of people and
some of which are not likely to be occupied by
even a single clerk. One great colonnade, the
length of the building’s frontage, appears to have
no mission at present, and was apparently
designed as a banquetting hall. It was equipped
with lobbies, balconies and lockers, by the men of
the days of borrow and boom and bust. The best
thing would be to let half the building to insur-
ance companies and banks and merchants, if it
were possible to find ■ - •' -

object to the aid given to the farmer, but it does object
when the Freetrade party, after giving the farmer enormous
bonuses in the shape of railway rebates, and exemption
from local rates, and after taxing the manufacturer to
pay these bonuses, holds cocky up as a fine example of self-
supporting Freetrade enterprise, and jeers at the manu
factuier, who pays to assist the farmer and gets so little
assistance himself, as a parasite. (2) You say that ti e
Local Government Bill is bad because it proposes to

The annual show was held in Palmerston
(N.T.) the other week. The great natural indus-
tries were exhibited in the form of some flowers,
vegetables, sugar-cane, tobacco, and fruit from
the State-subsidised Botanic Gardens; specimens
of wolfram and tin from Pine and Brock’s Greeks ;
cases of butterflies and shells. Native implements
and photographs made up the other exhibits. The
live stock consisted of three dogs, four horses, two
goats, a ewe with lamb, and a pig. After 40
years developing the country with Ghow labor
this is the result!
Robert Thomson, F.1.A., who recently died
at Melbourne, was a member of a family of
scientists. His father, James Thomson, was Pro-
fessor of Mathematics at Glasgow University
from 1832 till his death in 1849. Two elder
brothers were the late James Thomson, LL.D.,
F.R.S., Professor of Engineering at Glasgow
University from 1872 to 1889 (died 1892), and
Lord Kelvin (William Thomson). Robert,
whose talent was essentially mathematical, came
to Melbourne over 50 years ago, and in 1854
became secretary to the A.M.P. Society, then in
its fifth year of existence. In 1861 he accepted the
actuary’s post in addition to the secretaryship.
He resigned in 1865, and was afterwards actuary
to the Colonial Mutual Li fe Society.
Ex-Sydney Telegraph editor Brient, now
in England, writes an article under his own name
for the British Australasian, cursing most of
the Telegraph’s gods. As to immigration, he
says it is rubbish for Australia to struggle after
an agricultural population until it has bred or
attracted an army of consumers. Even the
English agriculturist, such as there is of him,
knows that distance from market is of tremendous
importance; and if there is anything else that
Hodge knows it is that Canada is nearer England
than Australia is, so if he must find a market in
Europe he will go to Canada or the U.S. every
time.

A groan from the banks of Yarra :
For the third time some pretentious Melbournites, who
try by apeing English fashions to show superiority to the
common herd, are hiding the mud-dredge’s nakedness
with cretonne borrowed from the spare bedroom, in the
endeavor to provide something like a pleasure-barge at
the festival, foolishly christened Henley -on-Yarra. It
may interest these persons to know that a leading London
journalist describes the original Henley regatta as “ the
revolting debauchery which for three days annually dese-
crates one of the fairest reaches on the Upper Thames.” To
judge from previous displays, it would be an unwarranted
compliment to call the Melbourne affair anything like
that. The element of cheap pretence governs the whole
show. Gingerbread “aristocracy” tries to look as if it
was joining in gilt-edged orgies, while the draperies of
the alleged house-boat, lifted by the wind, show that
gaudy vessel to be mainly composed of dirty tomato-
cases.
MUCH THE SAME.
BIRDIE: "Did you ever dream you was in

The High Court’s reversal of N.S.W. Full
Court’s decision in a case which turned on the
liability of the Government with regard to roads
under its care, has the merit of common sense. A
man proceeding on a dark night along a back-
blocks road, constructed 20 years ago, fell down a
cutting, with painful results. After prolonged
litigation, the High Court has finished the plain-
tiff up by declaring that the State cannot be
reasonably expected to maintain remote highways,
in empty regions which yield little or no revenue,
and where there is hardly any population, in a con-
dition equal to that of George-street, Sydney, for,
if it had to do so, the Government would simply
have to give up road-building. On this particular
road the accident complained of was the first in 20
years, so the inference was that ordinary precau-
tions would make it safe enough. Apart from the
dry law, the decision is welcome as a wet blanket
on the universal practice of demanding vast sums
from the Government whenever a person falls over
himself and makes his nose bleed.
Dr. Lloyd, the very remarkable magistrate
of North Melbourne, who is reputed to always
decide in favor of the girl, however improbable
her story may be, dropped last week on some-
thing which he described as “a scandal and a
national disgrace.” He had been “informed,” he
said, that a Senator (name not given) had his
father and his mother on the old age pension list
of some State not specified. As he gave no names,
and only professed to be gossipping from hearsay,
like any other old woman leaning over a back
fence, the statement doesn’t amount to very
much ; still, even if the quaint old person of
North Melbourne doesn’t know what Senator he
is talking about, he might at least pass along the
name of his informant, so that some attempt could
be made to verify the “ disgrace.” But supposing
the story to be true, it isn’t necessarily so dis-
graceful as some of Dr, Lloyd’s decisions. An old
age pension isn’t charity; it is the right
of every venerable person of good character
who really needs it, and who has a certain
claim on the State by reason of long re-
sidence. It is no more of a disgrace to
take it than it is for Dr. Lloyd to take his income
—in fact it may be much less of a disgrace, for an
old resident’s past services to the State may
justify him or her in collecting the pension money
much more than Dr. Lloyd’s present services
justify him in collecting his money. But it
certainly is a national scandal and a public disgrace
that any J.P. person should allude to the old age
pension as if the receipt of it were a slur and some
sort of a badge of infamy. As to the alleged son
in the Senate, if he really exists he certainly gets
his £4OO a year. But he may have a large family
to support; he may have to live away from home
during the session ; he may be burdened with
debts which have to be liquidated ; he certainly
has to pay election expenses periodically and to
confront the horde of beggars who swarm round
every Australian politician. There are plenty of
conceivable circumstances in which a Senator with
£4OO a year might not have £1 a week to dissipate
on his own account, even though he led a life of
rigid economy such as many a J.P. doesn’t dream
of.

St. Peters struggle to have itself called
Brompton ends for the present, theN.S.W. Legis-
lative Council having fired the Bill out of the
premises. St. Peters began its career as a local
habitation in a sorry little way. Governor Gipps
went out there, one bleak morning, and laid the
first stone of a small Anglican church, to accom-
modate a few residents, who found Sydney too
far off on Sundays. Bishop Broughton called the
church St. Peters, and gradually the people who
lived about it became known as residents at St.
Peters instead of Cook’s River people. Almost
the first official act relating to St, Peters was a
piece of roguery. The British Treasury passed a
special annual grant of £5OO to be spent on
propagating religion in the wilds of New South
Wales. This sum was to be devoted to the “most
distant and destitute parts of the colony.” St.
Peters managed to annex most of the grant,
though there were struggling church settlements
as far out as Queanbeyan, Mudgee and Wellington,
which got nothing. After that St. Peters began
to make bricks, which was almost its first respect-
able action.

Further proofs of the existence of a very-
ancient and prehistoric race have been discovered
at Warrnambool (Vic.) by a German professor
from Heidelberg University. This time the report
appears to be genuine, for, in the cave where the
footprints were found, there was a number of
hieroglyphics beneath a rude drawing of six figures
carrying what appeared to be hats of the kind worn
when Adam was an infant. The hieroglyphics
have not yet been fully deciphered, but are under-
stood to express grave alarm that capital is being
driven out of the country. A totem showing a
figure holding its nose over a dead prawn has led
the professor to believe that the prehistoric owner
of the cave was the originator of the Stinking
Fish party and the proto-Kyabramite. He is hard
at work deciphering the inscriptions and will
cable the result of his work to Germany.

A few cheerful facts about our “ fellow-
Briton of the East ” were related by a returned
missionary from Japan (Mrs. Rowlands), at the
Melbourne Anglican cathedral last week. In the
course of her remarks about this highly-civilised
race, which Spruce Myth wishes admitted into
Australia on terms of equality, Mrs. Rowlands
said (Argus report):—
The standard of morality, as judged from a Western
standpoint, was at a very low level indeed. There were
numbers of primary schools, which were filled with girl
pupils, and colleges and even universities where litera-
ture, both English and Japanese, was taught, and amuse-
ments, such as tennis, dancing, and calisthenics, indulged
in ; but, in spite of a girl receiving a first-class education,
her father still had the right, and in a great many eases
availed himself of it, to sell her into a life that the Eng-
lish mind revolted from.

Among the shows given by the Melbourne
police, at the recent carnival in aid of the Infants’
Asylum, were “a bank burglary, with blowing
open of safe, and pursuit and capture of burglars,”
and “the assault on and capture of the Magpie
tote.” Fancy thus advertising the force’s most
egregious failures to uphold the law within recent
years—capturing the Magpie tote in burlesque
while Wren’s tote still runs and daily defies the
Law ; and paiodying the capture of bank burglars
while the men who burgled the Box Hill bank and
got away with all the cash are still at large.
A DEEP DISSEMBLER.

The “ Continental Sunday ” is spreading
its deadly influence over Melbourne. Besides the
pleasant Sunday evening concerts, to which the
churches object, and the unpleasant Sunday after-
noons, which they themselves run, Prahran gives
a pleasing morning show in the shape of a fight
between the hostile factions of the local Church of
Christ. The dispute seems to have originated in
the desire of each party to have all its own way.
A Sunday or two back one section was fired out,
and expressed its determination to return and
argue the matter further. The next Sunday a
large crowd, supervised by two constables,
stood outside the House of God, while five
anaemic but determined individuals ascended
the stone steps and endeavored to attend worship,
They were ejected by the other party, bruising
the steps and scratching the gravel in their flight, f
One was a blind man, and lie immediately led a
second attack on the citadel, but those holding the
fort were resolute, and this time the attackers
retired even more hurriedly and scratched more
gravel. Once again the “ outs ” made a rush, and
this time succeeded in planting themselves firmly
in a front pew, whereupon the others evacuated
the citadel, closed the doors, and abandoned the
service. So far there has been no offer of an armis-
tice, truce, or peace treaty, and the parties seem
too violent for arbitration.

Pathetic letters have been received in
Maoriland from some of the ’Lijer Dowie dupes,
who are trying to get away from Zion city and
back to their old homes. Their disillusionment
is complete, and the “profit” with the snowy
whiskers is execrated in most luxuriant language.
According to one writer, there has been great
depression in Zion for the last two years. The
golden inducement held out to converts that 70
per cent, of the profits on ordinary industries was
divided amongst the people turns out to be all
flam. Nor is there 10 or 12 per cent, on the lace
industry, as promised. Six per cent, only is guar-
anteed, but just nowall the lace machines are idle.
“ There are many sad hearts in Zion city,” says a
correspondent; “people have to go outside to
look for work, and people are kicked out for the
merest trifle.”

The ease with which a young man may

establishment requested a shop assistant to lead
his cow from Adelaide to his residence in the

he had received no training in the profession of
leading cows. Furthermore, he drew his wages
for selling socks. He didn’t lead the cow, and
now he isn’t drawing any wages at all.

And people with weak hearts should take more care.
It seemed quite natural that Brown should die,
But we—we were immortal, Jones and I.
And as we left him ’neath the cypress tree,

As though he thought my hold on life was slim,
He does not know I mean to bury him.

The obscure Accountants’ and Clerks’
Association, Ltd. (Melbourne) is unfortunately a
very slow and conservative body. Its directorate
consists of no fewer than 13 alleged accountants
and two clerks. And it has nothing to do
with, and no sympathy with, the Clerks’ Union
which was formed some time ago. At the annual
meeting of members, held on August 31, one
emphatic person broke out in protest against the
apathy of those well-placed people who control
the association. The chairman, in reply, informed
the strenuous one that the board had no intention
of agitating for non-sweating legislation. It is
difficult to see what advantage there can be in
supporting an association which, while it carries a
liability in the event of its going into liquidation,
positively discourages any attempt to protect its
members from the pound-a-week sweater. What
clerks want is an association which will adopt for
itself a vigorous anti-sweating policy, and which
won’t be happy till it gets a law to prevent the
possibility of capable clerical 40-year-olds being
forced to toil for 3s. a day in order to preserve
their large and unhappy families from absolute
crustlessness—a law which will protect men and
women clerks alike.

drawn blanks or not till the day is done. There is,
therefore, much counter-spying going on in Bris-

which are unresponsive, many vast thirsts which
go unquenched, and a great increase in weary
travellers and the number of suddenlv-taken-ill
citizens.
“ G.H.” about a noble light
The Greek who publishes the midnight oyster is some-
times a better man than the world gives him credit for.
Two cheap spielers entered a Swanston-street fish kingdom
the other night, and ordered crayfish in terrible language.
There were some ladies present, and the Dago waiter re-
quested the newcomers to take a large scythe and prune
their dialogue somewhat. The gentlemen from Bourlce-
street responded with more language, and Demetrius
Oysteropulos again urged them to use the well of British
undefiled. The “sports” scoffed and put their feet on
the table-cloth. It was the last time of asking. De-
metrius Oysteropulos instructed Constantine Steakopulos
to take back the crayfish. Then he laid down his servi-
ette and seized the first spieler by the scruff of the neck
and the near leg. The spieler resolved himself into a
squirming, waving, biting, spitting cat-fight, but
the Dago bore him to the front door, took
a deep breath, and heaved his burden right across
the tram-track. The assistant, Constantine Steakopu-
los, said “ Hooray ” in the Greek language, but
Demetrius Oysteropulos strode back to the dining-room.
The other waster had entrenched himself behind a barri-
cade of chairs, and waved a cruet in a threatening'
manner. Demetrius Oysteropulos charged, dodged, and
the cruet made a holv wreck of a mirror on the opposite
wall. D. Oysteropulos climbed over the barricade at this
juncture, and felt under the table for the spieler. The
table arose in an erratic fashion, and fell upon its side
with a crash. D. Oysteropulos arose also, with his prey.
He bore him to the doorstep, and C. Steakopulos com-
menced to chant the fore-quarters of the Greek National
Anthem. D. Oysteropulos stood up like a Spartan at
Thermopylae, and threw his second cargo across the
street. I was so much impressed that I recited a large
quantity of Byron’s verse upon the spot. I take my fried
fish regularly now at the establishment of D. Oysteropulos.
A waiter like that is worth having.

In his recently-published ‘ ‘ Soul of Lon-
don,” F. M. Hueffer meets the frequent jeremiads
against town life with a medico’s opinion :
Town life isn’t unhealthy ; the art of sanitation did not
begin until the towns grew large. Did you ever see an
old farm-house? Where did they build them? Always
in hollows, in muddy, airless bottoms, to be near water—
you understand—near water —and they drained into that
water; and they were plague-houses all of them. Did
you ever have to do with a sick farm laborer ? Those
fellows ! Why, they fold their hands and die for a touch
of liver. Their life doesn’t hold them because it contains
no interest. Why, I’d rather attend fifty London street
rats, with half a lung apiece, than one great, hulking
farm bailiff. Don’t you see, my dear sir, your problem is
to breed disease-resisting men, and you won’t do it from
men who mope about fields and hedges. No ! modern
life is a question of towns. Purify them if you can ; get
rid of smoke and foul air if you can. But breed a race
fitted to inhabit them in any case.
And, assuming that the worst they say of tropical
Australia is true, these latter remarks fit that case,
too.

Vic. Attorney-General Davies has dis-
covered that the State Judges have for long been
exercising a power they had no right to —that of
releasing under bond first offenders over 21. Sec.
353 of the Crimes Act restricts this clemency when
exercised by Judges to persons under 21. When
applied to culprits between 21 and 25, sec. 354 of
the Act vests the power in the Governor-in-
Council; and there is no provision for showing
such mercy to first offenders over 25. There has
not been alleged any abuse of the system, and if
A. G. Davies is well advised he will take steps to
legalise the assumed right. But the fact that five
Supreme Court Judges have for years assumed
unchallenged a right they did not possess explains
why the High Court has so often to reverse
Full Court decisions.

A down-South township in Maoriland

that he “lift the coort widout a stain on his char-

furiously up and down the path in front of the
hall of justice, and got himself arrested and
charged with the offence. Sitting in judgment on

“ Yarrum,” on art-unions
Next time a man asks me to take a ticket in an art-
union I’ll jump hard on his face. Once, at Tooboogooloo
(or thereabouts), a woman friend of mine held a ticket
which should have secured for her a buggy and a pair
of ponies valued afc £6O. Instead of the trap and
prgg.croos she had sent her a pair of bullock s horns,
beautifully polished. She’d have “had the law on’
the clergy and others, only she was advised to let the
matter R.1.P., as she would have no luck. Again, at
another place in Australia, I was victimised in a barefaced
wav. There was an art-why “ art,” I wonder ?-union
in aid of a church, and we all took tickets. I sold three
books. The meanest man in the place gave an organ
valued at £2O ; and, strange to say, he won it. Another
old church-goer, and one of the promoters, donated a LlO
gold watch, and he won it. I spent the biggest part of a
pound in making the organ-giver tight, and when seeing
him home, he gave the whole show away. He had given
the organ on the understanding that he got it back again.
“ It was,” he explained, “ your ticket that should have
got it, but we knew you had no use for the dashed thing.
No doubt the gold watch was parted with on the same
understanding. I’d have taken action in the matter, only
was threatened with being boycotted. Some of the pro-
moters of these swindles should go and be land agents,
and then decent people would know how to take them.

“O’Fipp” : “Homo” asks (B. 17/8/05),
“Would the Chinaman sacrifice his beloved
caudal ornament ” for the sake of joining in the
scrap against the Russians ? One who sacrificed
his some years ago tells me that the Chinese
Empire Reform Association, a sort of giant
Kyabramapootra, possesses 25,000,000 members,
in all parts of the world, all of whom favor cutting
off the pigtail. The reformers believe that if
every Chow can be persuaded to go in for Euro-
pean clothes and hair-cuts the empire will make
enormous progress. Only a small proportion have
so far carried these views into practice, as an idea
is current that if the Dowager Empress saw a man
with his queue cut off she would just as soon as
not make his head follow.

It transpires that the loyal desire of Mel-
bourne Hospital Committee to tack the word
“Royal” to the institution’s title is to cost the
hospital £5O. The change cannot be made for
less. It is up to the gentlemen who desire to
express their “loyalty and devotion” in this
particular way to at least be loyally devoted at
their own expense.

It looks as though the tall silk hat that
the doctor used to carry his stethoscope in isn’t
any longer a necessary part of his stock-in-trade.
During the Medical Congress in Adelaide a pic-
ture was taken of 89 doctors’ hats, and all but 14
of them were either “boxers” or of the s ft,
wide-brimmed sort that you couldn’t crowd a
stethoscope into anyhow. And another picture
was made of the five chief officers of the Confer-
ence, and not one of them wore a tall, dazzlesome
hat. Perhaps the hat isn’t reckoned of so
much consequence now to the profession as the
stuff that it covers.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
N.S.W. State Treasurer Oarruthers threw his
usual small second-hand brick at “ Federal extravagance ”
in the course of his Budget speech—and incidentally
tooted his own little trumpet. “ Whereas in the State
departments not transferred to the Commonwealth the
expenditure has decreased from £4,248,000 to £3,829,000,
in the Federal departments the expenditure has increased
from £1,343,000 to £1,590,000.” This yarn as to the
tremendous economy of State administration always stops
dead short at 1901 or 1902. It never goes back to, say,
1898, and points out that in that year the expenditure on
all departments, including those taken over by the
Commonwealth, was only £9,476,619, whereas now,
with defence, post and telegraphs, and Customs
transferred, the expenditure, according to Oarruthers’
own estimates, is £11,407,900. When Oarruthers satis-
factorily explains how it is that, without these three
great departments to maintain, he is still spending
£1,931,281 more than was spent in 1898, it will be a fair
thing to listen to him when he talks of other people’s
“ extravagance.” The familiar gag that old age pensions
are responsible is, of course, too thin, seeing that Carru-
thers’ estimate for old age pensions this year only
amounts to £500,000; and £500,000 is a long way oil
£1,931,281.
One large reason why Federal expenditure is
increasing is that the Commonwealth hasn’t got a loan
fund to shoot awkward items into. Last year (again on
J. Oarruthers’ own admission) he spent £1,570,669 of loan
money, and even he only professes that £1,204,353 of it
was spent on productive works; the other £366,316
was sunk in roads and bridges and buildings. The Federal
Government didn’t borrow one cent; yet it spent last
year, on N.S.W. account, £122,059 on works, rifles, &c.,
and this year it expects to spend £153,511; and under
State administration practically the whole of this would
have been charged to loans. This year the post office
alone estimates an expenditure of £149,150 on telegraphs
and telephones, apart from £56,016 on buildings. In
short, this shocking Federal extravagance of which small,
unfinished critics of the Oarruthers kind squeal consists
of paying the bill; while State “economy” consists of
owing the money, and keeps on owing it, even when the
rifle has been discarded, and the bridge is decayed, and
the post-office is a ruin.
Premier Oarruthers ought to be about the last
man in N.S.W. politics, anyhow, to talk like this “He
wanted to warn the House as to the future. Unless some
arrangement was reached by an amendment of the
Federal Constitution in respect of a guarantee of the
return of a fixed sum to the States, the finance of the
States was bound to break down.” Last year Oarruthers
got from the Commonwealth £2,529,070 of Customs and
excise revenue. In 1898, when Oarruthers was a Minister,
the whole duties of customs and excise amounted to
£1,547,439. In other words, after paying for all
military services, and the deficit on the work-
ing of the post-office, and other services, the
Commonwealth paid Oarruthers £981,631 more than Car-
ruthers collected himself, gross, when he was in office and
could collect as much as he pleased. The Commonwealth
makes Oarruthers a present of the whole of the defence
expenses, and the amount of the post and telegraph
deficit, and £981,631 more than he collected himself into
the bargain ; and the yapping States-frights Premier still
talks about “ the Federal menace ” and the approaching
break-down of State finance.” Well, Oarruthers pro-
bably knows best the sort of man the States (one State,
anyhow) get to boss their finance and the sort of mess
he is liable to make of it, even under such remarkably
favorable circumstances as the foregoing.

The long-drawn-out life-assurance case of Glissan
v. Crowley, of the City Mutual, was ended last week by
the High Court allowing secretary Crowley’s appeal from
N.S.W. Full Court. Main grounds were stated by Chief
Justice Griffith It seemed to him (the C.J.) that any
man might have come to the conclusion that the charge
of corruption was not true ’’—Glissan had said there was
“nothing but corruption between Crowley and the
directors “ and that that was not a proper inference to
draw from the facts. A reasonable man might have come
to the conclusion that the charge was much too large
and that if some of the facts alleged were evidence of cor-
ruption they did not justify the statement ‘there is
nothing but corruption.’ Further, the charge applied to
all the directors, whereas the evidence showed that it
applied to two only of the five, and in some of these
matters the transactions were equally open to an inno-
cent construction. Justice Barton concurred ; Justice
O’Connor added that “ it must be taken that the defama-
tory matter was a charge of systematic corrupt conduct
between Crowley and his directors ; and he could see no
evidence to establish that position, though the Supreme
Court seemed to think there was some evidence of cor-
ruption.”

That is how matters stand according to the Life Assurance
Account in the returns which the society has to furnish
under the Victorian law. But the figures are utterly mis-
leading. In addition to its Life Assurance Account the
society runs another, called the General Division ; and
into this the society pushes most of its expenses. This
“general division” last year had an income of £66,141
derived from “fees, taxes, supplies,” etc., and it
not only absorbed the whole of this, but another £1448
besides. Of the outlay in this section £50,028 went in
extension of the order ”. As, outside the Life Assurance
Department, the society does practically no business (it
runs a sick and funeral benefit, but the contributions to
that amount to only £50,778), it is perfectly clear that
almost the whole of the “general division” expenses
must be borne, by the insurance business. In fact, the
general division appears to have been created for no other
purpose than to pay expenses, and to disguise the real
cost of insurance to the insurers. Dividing the expenses,
then, in this section between the life and the sick and
funeral businesses in proportion to income, it is
found that the expenses of the Life Department
are £62,560 more than is shown in the Victorian
schedule under Life Assurance Account. . Instead
therefore, of expenses being £5 15s. 4d. per cent, of total
income, the cost to members is £l5 ss. per cent. Apart
from every other consideration, this concern, with its
“fraternal” humbug, costs its insurers on the average
nearly twice as much in expenses as they could get their
insurance done for in the largest of Australian offices
and a great deal more than they could get it done for in
some other Australian offices.
This cheap-jack method of doing business runs
through the whole concern. The insurance in force on Dec
31st was £48,579,200. Against that, total insurance funds
were £1,652,946. For every £1 it has contracted to pay the
1.0. F. has saved up eightpence. For every £1 of its lia-
bilities it last 3’ear added just Id. to its funds. In view of
this rate of progress the obvious course for the insurer is
to die promptly and get in his claim before the funds run
out or the premiums are increased—the society has the
right to put up the premium to what figure it pleases to
prevent the funds running out. And if an ancient
insurer cannot pay he has to pass out; there is no sur-
render value. Anj'thing more treacherous in the way of
alleged life insurance it would be hard to conceive.
**••••
In the absence of any surrender value, in the
shape of paid-up policies or otherwise, the number of
forfeitures is appalling—or it would be appalling if for-
feitures weren’t, in most cases, the best thing that could
happen. Last year, for 1417 policies which matured
through death, 20,776 were forfeited. Fourteen persons
thus lost all they had paid in for every person whose rela-
tives benefited by the insurance. In Victoria 942 policies
were in force at the end of 1903. At the end of 1904 there
were only 735. That alone ought to be a sufficient hint
to the concern that it isn’t wanted in Australia. Yet
compared with that move-out, what sort of a scuttle
would there be if the premiums were raised, as inevitably
they must be unless the number of forfeitures is main-
tained.
Two years ago it was pointed out that, even of
its small funds, the 1.0. F. had nearly a quarter of a
million, or more than one-sixth of all its possessions, in
Unjon Trust Co. stock. It was then asked, “ What is this
Union Trust Co., anyway?” The question needs to be
asked twice now. For from £214,167 in 1902, the amount
of 1.0. F. funds which this Union Trust Co. has absorbed,
has jumped to £753,573. Of this total, £450,935 is
described as in Union Trust Co. stock and £302,638 as in
Union Trust Co. investments. Thus very nearly half of
the entire funds—poor little funds as they are—are in
this one basket. Has the 1.0. F. been forced to buy all
this stock and take over these investments to keep the
rest of the eggs it had in that basket from smashing ? That
is one possible explanation, anyhow. Twelve months ago
Canadian financial papers made very disrespectful remarks
about the co. And, in any case, what can be thought of
the management of an insurance office which puts £753,573
out of total funds of £1,652,946 in one co.’s stock and
“ investments,” whatever the latter may mean ?

The documents issued annually by thh society are partly
accounts and partly riddles. In 190 V it was announced
that an extra } per cent, would be paid to depositors and
debenture-holders, and in 1903 that extra £ per cent, was
shown as deducted from the profit made in 1902. In pre-
vious years, when overhauling these accounts, an attempt
was made to debit 1902 with this extra interest; and so
on for subsequent years. In 1904 it was announced that
“ a further £ per cent. ” would be paid in November ; and
the present accounts show the whole extra 1 per cent,
deducted from the profits for 1904. Now it is announced
that “an additional half per cent.” will be paid in
November ; but whether this % per cent, is in addition to
the 3J per cent., or whether it is the extra % per cent,
paid in 1904 repeated, there are no means of telling till
the next accounts are issued. In the foregoing table,
therefore, the interest actually paid during the year
covered by the accounts is shown.
The Modern was an exceedingly bloated con-
cern, which, when the boom went out, found itself
with about £200,000 of deposits, £350,000 debentures, and
£45,000 overdraft. Since then it has set itself to clear up
the disaster, and, comparatively speaking, has met with
considerable success. In 10 years the movement has
been:—

Overdrafts, etc. .. .. 30,788 7,000 23,788
Totals .. .. £534,177 £276,231 £257,946
On the other side advances, foreclosed properties, etc.
have been reduced from £698,505 to £342,457, or by
£356,048 ; while £34,847 has been added to Vic. Govern-
ment stock and cash balances, present total of these
items being £34,941. Thus at the cost of £356,048 of
assets, liabilities have either been reduced, or it is now
possible to reduce them, by £292,793; so that the
realisation has panned out about 16s. 2d. in the £,
and meantime deposits and debentures have been
carrying from 2£ to 3£ per cent. At this rate
the remaining assets, including the society’s pre-
mises (£78,000) would realise £340,000, against a net
liability to the public (outstanding debentures, &c., less
public stocks and cash) of £241,384. This would leave a
deficit of about £99,000. The capital is £198,897, so that
on this figuring £lOO,OOO of it would be intact. As a
matter of fact, the position is probably better than that,
because, whereas previously 75 p.c. of the assets (apart
from premises and cash) consisted of foreclosed pro-
perties, now only 42 p.c. is in those lines ; the balance is
represented by advances. The worst feature of the case
is that the society still holds £60,566 in vacant land ; and
that is a dead horse which is being got rid of very slowly*

There is no sign of a cleaning-up in this extremely gra-
dual society. This is the way realisations have crawled
along—the figures show book value of properties on hand
and advances, exclusive of a special item of £2671, sub-
urban villas:—
1896 .. £74,277 1901 .. £70,820
1897 .. 73,740 1902 .. 69 413

1899 .. 72,675 1904 .. 68 759
1900 .. 72,378 1905 .. 68,731
Nothing whatever has been written off these at any time.
The society’s last effort in the way of writing-down was in
1891, and was directed to the small special item previously
mentioned. To allow these properties to return 6 per
cent, gross they should be written down to £33,500.
Then, with the mock reserves smudged out, the capital
would stand at £30,000, and a few pounds would be left
over to go to a genuine reserve fund—anyhow, to a con-
tingency fund, for even this treatment would not be
drastic enough to guarantee that there would be no losses
on realisation. The society has now spent 14 years
waiting for something to turn up (the divs. stopped
suddenly 14 years ago), and there isn’t a sign of anything
turning up. In fact, almost the only thing that could
turn up to do the society much good would be another
Dunky Gillies and another wild boom ; and Oohen isn’t
providing the funds for another drunk even supposing
another D. Gillies were available. The farce has been
played long enough; the Albert should face the situ-
ation, do the honest and sensible thing, set down figures
which will mean what they say, and then, if it pleases, it
can go into ordinary business again. At present it has
only £2OB in deposits; what else it owes the public (£4028)-
it has had to raise’ on mortgage.

Shareholders thought better of it and didn’t press this
society into liquidation. Properties were written down
£22,076 (that is to say, about 55 p.c. was written off), and
on this valuation they show a return of £6 7s. 6d. p.c.
It seems highly probable, therefore, that the writing-
down has been reasonably thorough. The society has
now only £4921 of deposits ; practically the whole of this
is out in advances. Deposits seem to carry 4 per cent. ;
advances to average about 7 per cent., which helps to
keep the pot boiling. It is now a very small pot; but
there seems no good reason why it should not
become a larger one, and so spread the very moderate
expenses over a wider area. Presumably while this is
going on the society will still try to realise its properties
on hand, seeing that the whole of its funds are locked up
in them and that, even at the written-down value, the
return from them is a shade poorer than from advances.

But, as usual, the published figures appear to be of very
little value. The society shows £3OBO as paid on interest
account. Fixed deposits alone total £197,138, and they
carry 2£ per cent. ; so that lot of itself would call for £4928
for interest. The society appears to be still buying
up deposit receipts at a heavy discount, and part of
the amount made in this way is apparently set against
interest. Therefore the real loss on ordinary business,
after paying only 2£ per cent, interest, is much heavier
than is shown. The society still refers to its assets as
“ loans on mortgage,” though no doubt the vast majority
of the securities are properties in possession. These
assets last year brought in £1502 after paying repairs and
rates ; that is to say, about 6s. sd. per cent. This is about
the worst showing of any Vic. building society, and the
position is not improving. Nevertheless, though hardly
any progress is being made, and though this wretched
return is shown, management expenses last year reached
£1722, absorbing nearly 40 per cent, of the gross income
from rents, interest, fines, and fees. After paying
management and office expenses there is, in fact,
not enough derived from interest, rents, fines, and
fees, to pay rates and repairs ; so that the
whole of the interest is being paid out of
capital, and part of the heavy management expenses as
well. It is just about as certain as anything can be that
the whole of the shareholders’ capital is lost. To make
the assets earn even 2 p.c. after paying rates and repairs,
they would have to be written down from £477,000 to
£75,000, or by £402,000, and the shareholders’capital is
only £231,490. Therefore, since the 2£ p.c. is being paid
wholly out of capital, it must be coming out of the
depositors’ capital. Apparently some of the depositors
have the idea that they are getting interest, but they -re
clearly getting nothing of the sort. It is full time everybody
connected with the awful disaster received a fair state-
ment of the true position, that something like a reason-
able valuation was made of the securities, and the present
absurd figures abolished. Last year the old deposits were
reduced from £206,071 to £197,138, or by £8933, and the
“loans on mortgage” from £473,588 to £462,919, or by
£10,669. But this doesn’t necessarily mean that the
assets brought about 18s. in the £ ; it probably means
that some of the creditors accepted a few shillings in the
£. In fact, the published accounts are a huge piece of
make-believe ; and farce of this sort has surely gone far
enough.

Though the profits are the least made since the beginning
of 1903, the dividend is put up to 12 per cent., so that the
little Commercial of Tasmania now ranks with the best in
the matter of rate of dividend. Still, chiefly as the
result of its comparatively large reserves, which now
amount to almost as much as the capital (£141,492), its
12 p.c. calls for no more than 78 p.c. of its profits. Cer-
tainly 22 p.c. is not too much to put aside; only eight
out of 24 Australasian banks put by less ; and, in view of
the downward movement in profits, the Commercial of
Tasmania would have done better to wait and see where
the movement was going to end before it disturbed the
old 10 p.c. As to profits on capital and reserves com-
bined, four years’ record has been :
Feb., 1902 £7 0 2 p.c. Feb., 1904 £8 18 11 p.c.
Aug., 1902 7 211 „ Aug., 1904 911 0 „
Feb., 1903 619 4 „ Feb., 1905 9 9 8 „
Aug., 1903 918 0 „ Aug., 1905 8 7 7 „
These figures cast still further reflections upon the in-
crease of dividend at this stage. Deposits are £1,492,802
against £1,433,098 twelve months ago; advances
£1,225,360, against £1,312,986. More money in hand,
and probably carrying interest ; less money out earn-
ing interest. That doesn’t look a cheerful movement
on which to increase the div. either. The net result is
that the bank has £281,633 in bullion, &c., against
£217,693 twelve months back ; while it has now £68,500
out with other banks against nothing in that way 12
months ago. If Tasmania had a stiff graduated land-tax
to force on closer settlement, its banks would, no doubt,
be able to find more profitable uses for their money than
either storing up bullion in their safes or letting it out for
a trifle that other banks may make use of it in Australia
and Maoriland.

The reserves consist of £21,816 sinking fund for the
return of capital (separately invested in public stocks),
£11,896 reserve for depreciation and renewals, and
£1855 undivided profits. As the undertaking is
in as an asset at cost price, the reserves are,
to some extent, nominal—to the extent to which
plant, &c., has already depreciated. From profits there
is a special appropriation of £2300, “ being the annual
surn necessary to be set aside to repay capital ” ; in the
foregoing table this sinking fund is reckoned as a reserve,
a previously shown. On total funds the return is a shade
over 8£ p.c.—highly respectable still, though a good deal
less than it was a tew years ago. In fact, it requires the
earnings of the extra £15,000 of subscribed capital and
the undivided profits, to maintain profits at about their
old level —all of which can probably be explained in three
words, “ electric-power competition.”

The published accounts don’t make the year’s trans-
actions any too clear. They show a “special dividend”
of £19,250; apparently that amount has been added to
capital, and £2634 has been called up. Previously
the capital was £27,500; it is now £49,384.
One result will be to disguise the size of
future dividends. The shares still carry a liability
of £50,616, though it is impossible to tell from the
present balance sheet whether it is equally distributed
over the 100,000 shares. Generally speaking, operations
have shrivelled a little during the year. Deposits and
money due on mortgage total £130,384, as against £135,051
twelve months ago ; co.’s own advances are £150,103
against £156,103. Properties (not foreclosures) and bank
balances have moved up from £26,242 to £30,977. The
co. needs to go on strengthening its position like this;
for, considering the size of its deposits, its own immedi-
ately available resources were very small. Even now,
after paying current div., its liquid reserves amount to
less than 3J per cent, of its liabilities to the public ; and a
bank doesn’t feel too safe unless it has 30 per cent. Cer-
tainly a bank has current account deposits, and presum-
ably this co. hasn’t; but even so, though it is following
the plan that means fat divs. so long as things go well, it
is taking a large risk if things should go the other way.

In the last line, it is assumed that the usual bonus will
be paid to employees (for which purpose £475 is deducted
from profits), and that the average proportion of pur-
chasers’ bonuses will remain unclaimed. The gross profits
are just about maintained ; from them £340 has been
written off fittings and premises, against £405 the previ-
ous half-year. In the past the society was controlled
mainly by public servants and ex-servants; a vigorous
attempt is now being made to bring in outside commer-
cial men, with the avowed object of reducing expenses.
As to these expenses, this comparison shows the move-
ment :

The working expenses are exclusive of the variable de-
preciation charges and the bonus to employees. The net
profit for the half-year to January last was at the rate of
44 p.c. p.a. on shareholders’ total funds ; but whether
the concern would be able to make that profit if cus-
tomers didn’t know they were going to get back 10 p.c.
of the amounts they pay is another matter. Co., in spite
of the recent increase of capital, is still unable to quite
get rid of the old overdraft habit, though the offence is
now reduced to £2391.

Two items in the last line are doubtful. The co., which,
after a long struggle, had begun to feel its feet under the
Queensland high tariff, was sent reeling under the reduced
Federal tariff ; and the general depression in Queensland,
partly the result of misgovernment, partly of the drought,
completed the disaster. The co. had an overdraft of
£26,256 at June 30th, 1904 ; shortly after that the
bank, apparently seeing no chance of an early recovery,
began to be unpleasant. The co. was pressed to realise ;
it was compelled to give up retail business ; and numerous
branches were shut. Apparently the loss from this
forced realisation has been put to suspense account; but
whether the loss has been actually made, or whether a
recovery of part of it is still regarded as possible, cannot
be told from the accounts. Hence the queries. But
it looks most likely that the amount shown is an actual
loss, which will have to be provided for, probably with
other losses, by writing down capital. The stocks and
branch and other sundry debtor balances, 12 months ago,
totalled £41,371; they have now been reduced to £28,227,
a reduction of £13,144. On the other side the liabili-
ties to the public (consisting almost wholly
of overdraft) have been reduced from £29,396 to
£26,266—a reduction of only £3130. Unless the
assets have been severely written down, and the writing
down put into the suspense account, this is a very dis-
astrous realisation. In any case, the outlook is very
gloomy. The principal assets, apart from those men-
tioned, are machinery, plant, and buildings, £34,564 ; and
machinery that can’t work at a profit would have to be
written down very severely, too. The co.’s only visible
hope is a restoration of the duties to at least the old
Queensland State level; nothing could be clearer than
that the present revenue tariff is not enough to give the
industry a start. And the first practical step to that
end is for Queensland to vote only and absolutely for the
high tariffist. Sinking the fiscal issue means idle fac-
tories and idle artisans, while the agent who sells the
imported shoddy rules the roost. And from the point of
view of the farmer, the question is whether one im-
porter’s agent can consume as much produce as a hive of
artisans.

Broken Hill South has gone further than Block
10 and not only sold its “ tailings ” dumps outright, but
has sold nine years’ output ahead. “One of the condi-
tions of the contract is that the terms are not to be dis-
closed, nor the buyers’ names,” says the managing
director. Then it is up to shareholders to ask who owns
the mine, and after that to roast the board. Non-dis-
closure of buyers’ names is not a thing to put up with, for
one thing. The buyers might conceivably be the direc-
tors themselves, or some concern in which the directors, or
some of them, are interested. Further, to make a contract
nine years ahead, binding the co. and every future board
of directors for that time, means collaring a power which
it was surely never intended that any board should have.
If it can do this, why shouldn’t it appoint officers
for nine years, and make contracts for stores, &c., for
nine years, and other contracts for the sale of silver and
lead for nine years or eighteen years ? It is much the
same as if the board appointed itself for nine years.
There may be very special circumstances which justify
the extraordinary deal; but 'it is so extraordinary
that shareholders ought to be. told what these special
circumstances are, if they exist. Also, they should know

Experiments were recently conducted at the
Ivanhoe Mine, W.A., by the metallurgist Mr. Brett, with
the Wilfley Slime Table on the fine sands. The results
achieved were astonishing. The amount of concentrates
saved (vide, p. 298, “Monthly Journal of the Chamber
of Mines,” W.A., July 81, 1905) has, by means of the extra
Slime Table, been increased by 45 per cent., whilst the
total gold values have increased 60 per cent. Of this
Concentrate saved by the Slime Table, 92 per cent, is
pure Concentrate Slime. The results of the experiments
have been so satisfactory that the management have
ordered 11 more with the intentions of installing them
forthwith. It is then proposed to increase the number to
25. The Austral Otis Engineering Co., South Melbourne,
are the sole manufacturers for Australasia.*

in fuel and maintenance of boiler has to be seriously con-
sidered by competent engineers, the Babcock boiler is
installed. Hence the recent unanimous decision of the
Expert Admiralty Committee to install Babcock boilers as

of spiral rivited pipe have given it a place of superiority
above any other pipe. This pipe possesses enormous
bursting strength, and is protected, inside and out, with a
perfect coating manufactured from asphalt. Asphalt
coaled steel pipes have lasted from 25 to 40 years without
any sign Of decay, and may last as long again. Spiral
pipe is manufactured by Mephan Ferguson, at Wanganui,

even then some at least of the terms—whether, for
instance, they are going to share in the profits
which may arise from any metallurgical develop-
ments that mav take place within the next nine
years, or whether a present is made to the
buyers of all possibilities in that way. Supposing - the
then directors, or the Broken Hill companies in general,
had made a contract in 1895 for the sale of the sulphide
ores nine years ahead, what would they have got for
them ? Practically nothing—just as little, anyhow, as the
co. is most likely getting now for its “ tailings ” (and it is
to be remembered that these so-called tailings contain over
two-thirds of the metal values). The hundreds of thou-
sands thal the co. has paid in divs. since 1894 have almost
wholly resulted from discoveries and processes evolved
in the interval. Not a single Barrier mine was game to
tackle sulphides on a commercial scale till the end of that
year; yet practically the whole of the divs. paid by
B.H. co.’s during the past seven years have come from
those ores.
The B.H. South’s contract is easily the biggest
deal in ore ever made in Australia, and no doubt one of
the biggest ever made anywhere. The present dumps
contained by estimate 701,943 tons on June 30 ; assay
value, 6'7 p.c. lead, 4'goz. silver and 187 p.c. zinc. At
present market values this means: —
Lead •• .. , • ~ £658,400
Silver .. .. .. .. 353,700
Zinc 3,412,800
Total £4,424,900
That is for present dumps. But the “tailings,” apart
from slimes, which the co. apparently hasn’t sold, are
being added to at the rate of 150,000 tons a year, and the
plant is being greatly enlarged ; even at the present rate,
however, nine years’ output runs to 1,350,000 tons, equal
to £8,505,000 on the same basis. It is a deal, therefore,
in about £13,000,000 worth of metal, on the basis of
current prices. How much of the metal can be got out is
another matter. And, as pointed out just now, what can
be got out now, and what it may be possible to get out
eight or nine years hence, are also very different matters.
Even in its own history the B.H. South has found it
highly profitable, as the result of things it learned by the
way, to re-treat some of its old tailings for silver and lead.
For Australia the big question is : Where is the
stuff going to be handled? Is the treatment going to
employ Australians or foreigners ? Is it Australia that is
going to have a zinc (spelter) industry—an industry
which calls for a very large amount of labor both
directly and indirectly in the production of coal and coke
—or is Germany or Belgium going to get the benefit ? Is
Australia going to be a mere exporter of dirt—and it is a
flat enough country already without exporting dirt—or is
it going to work up its dirt into metal ? If the parties
have reckoned upon exporting dirt and giving the
foreigner the profitable work to do—exploiting Australia
to keep foreign workshops and factories going, and to
employ foreign labor and foreign capital—then they have
reckoned without an export duty.

Foreign buyers didn’t bid as high as the Sul-
phide Corporation for Block 14’s output of concentrates,
so the stuff will go to Cockle Creek (N.S. W.), to make up
for the Sulphide Co.’s own shortage, due to its creep
troubles. Foreign offers were expected to be more than
usually interesting. For some time returning charges
(the deductions made from value of metals to cover smelt-
ing and other costs after the ore leaves the mine) have
been very low, going down to £3 12s. 6d. per ton, and the
B.H. co.’s have benefited accordingly ; but there has been
talk for some time of putting up these charges, and £4
10s. was mentioned as a “ fair thing,” though charges have
been up to £5 10s. Result of Block 14 tenders shows
that something of the sort is happening, and that the
foreigners are not bidding up with their recent vigor. If
this lasts, it will mean a perceptible cut in the profits of
all B.H. co.’s except B.H. Prop, and Sulphide.

Coppabella isn’t a new field; it is merely a
resurrection. As far back as 1881 there was something of
a rush, and 37 leases were applied for in April and May.
Said the Warden, reporting to his department for that
year :—“ At the original find of Musgrove and party the
lode shows at the surface 25ft. wide. The vein stuff is
quartz, through which in parts is seen galena in patches.
At the west side there is an almost solid mass of galena
3ft. wide.” In 1889 the Warden lamented that the
deposits were still unworked. Writer had sent to him
that year a bag of samples, which assayed, from memory,
over 40oz. silver and 50 per cent, lead ; but information
regarding the quantity of stuff it was broken from wasn’t
comforting. In 1890 a few tons were sent away ; and it
was announced that something was going to happen.
Then, in 1891, the Mines report had this : “ All endeavors
to develop the silver mining at Coppabella and No Place ”
—apparently Blocks No’s. 1 and 2 or thereabouts —“ have
ceased, sufficiently good show's to tempt investors not
having been obtained.” It was probably because it had
these records in its office that N.S.W. Mines Department
didn’t get as much excited over the “ new ” find as some
market operators wanted it to.
* * * *
“Coppabella Prop. (N.S.W.) has eight tons of
good ore already stacked at the shaft.” No doubt 800
tons could be napped out of the lode along and above the
tunnel. But to get the 800 tons they would have to
handle about 5000 tons of lode matter—quartz, fluorspar,
and pyrites. Nothing has yet been got away from this
claim that improves the look of things. In the opening
furthest north on the Prop, itself the lode looks much
poorer than it does further south, and that isn’t a healthy
sign for the Cop. North. The Central is reported to have
a lode ; but it is very doubtful if it is a true lode. No. 1
and No. 2 are at present on dead work.
* * * *
Mt. Boppy’s half-liearted development in the
drives and crosscuts north of the fault and on . lode south-
east of main shaft hasn’t deterred properties at either end
from making progress. Mt. Boppy North, worked in the
interests, of J. Bull’s Gulf of Hauraki people, has just
equipped mine w’ith hauling engine, air compressor, Rand
rock-drills, &c., and policy is to sink to 400 ft. and drive
north. At 200 ft., Boppy North opened a low-grade
mineralised reef, of Isft. or thereabouts ; and as stone is
very like, and going in direction of Mt. Boppy’s “ blue
lode,” chances are that depth will show payable sulphides.
Diamond drill at work several hundred yards
south of Mt. Boppy (N.S.W.) is now in the deepest hole
(450 ft.) on the field. Country passed through has varied
between sandstone and slate, with occasional splashes of
mineral in the slate cores. Recent cores show a rather
more heavily mineralised -blue slate, but that is all that
can be said in respect to the gold deposit, which it is con-
fidentially stated the bore is in search of. No doubt on a
field like Cobar, with its payable deep shoots, there are
still possibilities in front of the drill, and before it gets to
its limit of 800 ft. the cores may possibly call for more
cheerful remark.

Barrier, Wyalong (N.S.W.), sent 45 tons of ore
and concentrates to Cockle Creek, and got 2840 z. gold.
This stone was taken from all parts of a reef averaging 12
to 18 inches wide. Ownership of the Mousetrap is still
undecided. Evidence of late owners against the cancella-
tion of the lease (taken before the Warden, July 10th last,
and forwarded to the Minister for Mines for final decision)
has evidently been pigeon-holed. Meantime lease is idle.
* V * *
August yield of W.A. gold mines was 174,881
fine oz., bringing total for expired portion of year to
1,306,0540 z., against 1,313,7660 z. for same period of 1904.
This shows a shrinkage of 77120 z. During last four
months of 1904 average yield was 167,3660 z., while this
year monthly average has been 163,2570 z., so a further
shrinkage compared with last year’s total seems inevi-
table. August output is, however, higher than any
month’s since January, 1904.
« * * *
Great Boulder Prop., Kalgoorlie, is keeping its
end up. At 1900 ft. shoot in north drive is 200 ft. long- and
worth 22dwt. for a width of Bft. Drive is being continued
in barren country so far. No driving south at 1900 ft. has
been done. Edwards shaft at south end of property is
down 1400 ft., and connected with the main workings at
that level. Hamilton shaft on north lease is now splen-
didly equipped, and is being sunk to prospect a lode
which was cut by bore in Jan., ’O4, at 1335 ft., and was
said to be worth 25dwt., for 10ft. wide. The attempt to
find this lode at 800 ft. and 1000 ft. failed.
* * * *
Boulder Deep Levels, Kalgoorlie, is opening up
fairly satisfactorily at 1100 ft. Where intersected by cross-
cut reef was broken and poor, exactly as at 900 ft. Up to
40ft. west drive assays only 1 to 2 dwt. For first 30ft.
east drive is no better, but at 30ft. assays rose to 4dwt.
At 41ft. the lode is sft., worth 17dwt.; and at 46ft. the
average is 2oz. for full width of drive. At 900 ft. mine has
a shoot nearly 200 ft. long worth about I7dwt., and, if
1100 ft. proves as good, co. will yet rank as a regular pro-
ducer. Co. is in 350,000 shares, 70,000 of them in reserve.
At time of scandal it treated 2,524 tons, as a test, for
1,4380 z. fine gold exclusive of tailings worth 6dwt.
■#r * * *
Lake View Consols, Kalgoorlie, is not looking
quite so hopeless as it did a couple of months ago, and
has now two strings to its bow. The famous Oroya shoot
is trending in direction of Lake View lease, but has still
1800 ft. to go to get there. At angle of dip it should
reach boundary at 1600 ft., and may be found any day, as
Lake View has 1600 ft. and 1800 ft. levels to prospect
from. The east lode at 1000 ft. has been driven on
considerably over 100 ft., and averages 7ft. wide, worth
13dwt. A crosscut is being put in to cut this lode at
400 ft. This is an entirely new lode, and may quite alter
prospects. Same lode is being worked from surface
under tribute, and returns have averaged 28dwt. from
ore 7ft. wide. This find should also benefit Central
Boulder, Associated, and Orova.
* * * *
Associated, Kalgoorlie, after closing down its
treatment plant for a fortnight for alteration and repairs,
is again in full swing. While plant was closed down very
little mining was done, as all shafts were more or less
dangerous through being badly timbered and mullocked,
and called for overhauling. Development of Oroya shoot
will now be vigorous, but, as in the case of the Northern
and Oroya, very little rook will be blocked out, the incline
winze practically depleting the pipe of ore, which ranges
up to 70ft. in width and 30ft. in height. If shoot con
tinues to Lake View Consols, as optimists predict, the
Associated will have a run of 2700 ft., worth at least £4OO
to £5OO per foot, not allowing for barren patches. Con-
sulting-engineer Cordner James told Associated meeting
that up to now the shoot from Brown Hill onwards had
yielded £2OOO per running foot. Put it at one-fourth of
that figure, and calculate result if Lake View happens to
cut it. There is no certainty, but there is a possibility,
and Associated shares are worth watching.
* * * *
Golden Pole, Davyhurst (W.A.), is now opening
up well at No. 4 level. North drive is going 60ft. monthly,
and is in over 200 ft. Reef averages 18in., and varies from
30dwt. to 6oz. Reef beyond crosscourse to south is worth
62dwt. at depth of 70ft. for 12in. wide. Filter presses
have now got to work, and are running full time, and re-
ported to be giving a good extraction. August return is
only 17890 z. from 1314 tons, as plant was stopped eight
days for boiler inspection and repairs. As slimes are
worth 7dwt., September results should be very much
better, and probably Is. divs. will be declared in future.
Vet shares continue weak, and nobody can tell why,
though it is well known that insiders have unloaded
heavily.
* * * *
Sirdar, Kanowna (W.A.), once notorious as
General Gordon, has had a clean up of 34 tons for 2400 z.
Return looks splendid till one reflects that the previous
yield of 43 tons for 87loz. dates back to January, 1904.
Mine’s battery is in same condition as left seven years ago
after the fiasco, the ore bin being half full of rock. This
property was badly mismanaged, and may yet be worked
on a big scale ; shareholders in old General Gordon got a
very poor run for their money.
* * * *
Queensland Menzies (W.A.) shows no improve-
ment, in spite of following advice of geologist Jack. As
manager Ferguson is satisfied that mine is played out, he
has been inspecting the Goodenough at Menzies. This
property was taken under option a couple of years ago
by Hamilton, on behalf of No. 1 Boulder, but rejected.
Since then, it has been worked by the owners, Feather-
stonhaugh Bros., who have taken out 3800 tons, yielding
70480 z. August result was 2750 z. from 130 tons. Mine is
intersected by an east and west reef, and such reefs do
not generally last in W.A.
* * * *
North White Feather, Kanowna (W.A.), after
passing through a worthless leader at 575 ft., cut the main
reef at 585 ft., and has followed it down to 600 ft. Manage-
ment says that no assays are to be taken till the footwall
is reached, but the gentle tout has already got to work
with his dish, and pronounces the reef buck quartz.
Quite possible the gold may be either north or south of
shaft, as shoots in Kanowna are irregular, and dip both
ways. As the Reward, Golden Cement, Main Reefs and
White Feather Extended, on the same reef, have all
petered out at comparatively shallow depths, scrip of this
co. can’t be recommended. The air winches hauling from
the lower levels of Main Reefs have been withdrawn,
and work is now confined to the two upper levels. This
may foretell early closing down.

Dalzell’s, the N.Q. tin show described in The
Bulletin, Sept. 14, has had a sensational market experi-
ence. Shares were three-times over-applied for ; Bs. was
paid on them. Before allotment they were at 2s. premium.
On allotment, ss. premium. Before end of last week, they
were snapped up at from 15s. to 175., and at time of writing-
are in the neighborhood of 20s.—a premium of 150 per
cent, in a fortnight from allotment. A market has been
made for them in Sydney and Melbourne. What
does it all mean ? John Moffatt, Munro, and Torpy,
the promoters, know the value of the show (abso-
lutely a surface show so far) better than anybody else. If
they don’t they ought to. They are all experienced men ;
Moffatt is perhaps the most experienced tin man in N.Q.
And the market is valuing the property at nearly three
times the figure put upon it by these three men. Well, so
much the worse for the market.
Charters Towers mills treated for August 18,154
tons for 13,8680 z., valued at £47,542. Cyanide dealt with
18,821 tons of residues for 86950 z. bullion, worth £15,400.
Smelters, etc., brought the total value to £79,015. Pre-
vious month’s returns were: mills 19,468 tons for
14,7330 z., and cyanide and other returns brought the
value to £81,360." August calls by 24 co.’S ran to £11,321,
while dividends by Alexandria, St. , George, Brilliant
Central and Queen Cross amounted to £12,350. Had it
not been for Golden Alexandria’s £1250 (the first), calls
would have overtaken divs., which is unusual. Previous
month calls were £4995, and divs. £18,261. Total calls
for eight months, £65,149 ; total divs., £136,550. Principal
contributors to Towers mills were : Block and Wyndham,
1870 tons for 14530 z. ; Brilliant Central, 2410 tons 16610 z. ;
B. Extended, 3120 tons 1184 oz. ; B. St. George, 2677 tons
15930 z. ; B. Block, 608 tons 2870 z. ; Phoebe, 680 tons
5270 z. ; Queen Cross, 2052 tons 19320 z. ; Band of Hope,
236 tons 50oz. ; New Queen, 504 tons 4820 z. ; Victoria and
Caledonia Block, 247 tons 2060 z. ; Victory Tribute
(Tucket’s), 53 tons 6060 z. ; Victory, 183 tons 1220 z. ;
Mills United, 1154 tons 1161 oz.
■» * *
Carrington’s Lion P. C., Charters Towers, 133
tons for 6060 z., equal to4oz. lldwt. per ton ; concentrates
about 20 tons, and residues to come. This is good ; but
no mention was made of the quantity it was picked from,
and picked it must have been, for it took three months to
raise it from a reef averaging 2ft. Previous crushing was
in May, when 26 tons gave 3030 z. ; the same month 28
tons of seconds as a trial gave 270 z. In April 51 tons
were put through for 3470z.—a1l exclusive of concentrates
and residues. Affairs are well managed ; mill returns and
information that the second crosscut at 160 ft. vertical had
cut 2ft. of sulphide ore were made public about the same
time. Property will not require much developing, as
there is only 400 ft. by 400 ft. When the Huntingdon mill
gets going, as it will early next year, holders
may reasonably expect dividends. Show should be above
call-making, and looks a good gamble. The adjoining
claim, known as the Excess (actually the ground pegged
by the prospectors in excess of their proper area) has a
shaft 108 ft., the sink of which shows copper stains. This
necessitates calls. Also there are other neighbors, all
callers. The P.C. has opened a London office and ap-
pointed two directors. All boom, boom, boom.
* -K * *
Band of Hope, Charters Towers, shows no im-
provement with development. Levels are being formed
on the 1400 ft. formations from the underlie down 259 ft.
Report says that 6in. of mineral stone of medium
quality is showing on the hanging wall. Medium is hardly
the word for the last crushing—336 tons for 560 z.; total
value £250. It takes about 14s. lOd. to cover costs of
carting and crushing. This is from the formation that
the Queen Cross is preparing to deepen its straight shaft
700 ft. to intersect. Still it may improve in settled
ground.
* * * *
Golden Alexandria, Charters Towers, has im-
proved of late. The 18in. of stone in the sink of the
underlie is suspected of carrying gold. South level has
picked up a foot of good stone. Show has 240 tons on
top that spells dividends. Brilliant Block for a fortnight
put through 480 tons for 2150 z., worth £753. Cyanide
clean up from a three weeks’ run, £lO3O. Prospects of
mine recovering its position have improved. A dividend
of 6d. has been declared, but this was the savings of seven
months.

Metallurgist Ashcroft, with John Moffatt at his
back, is having a go at Kangaroo Hills Copper, at Ewan
(N.Q.). Old co. spent money like water on the surface,
then bumped against two snags—(l) distance from mines
to the expensive smelters it had put up ; (2) want of fluxes.
Drought helped these two to knock the concern out.
Plant is practically new ; smelters turned out under £2OOO
worth of metal altogether. Between them, John Moffatt
and Ashcroft ought to about do the trick. Moffatt’s
mana just now is very fine and large. The Victory, at
Irvinebank, the best tin mine on the Australian mainland,
is paying in great style, and his share in the O.K. brings
him in a four-figure div. cheque every month.
* * * *
Berringa (Vic.) has been visited by State
Geologist Dunn, who startled the natives by telling them
that they are the proud possessors of a series of
saddle reefs. He is rather ecstatic over this addition to
the album of saddle reefs he has been filling ever since
he started with those at Bendigo. The main reliance of
the field so far has been on the ordinary lode formations,
such as those at the Birthdaj', but Dunn thinks now its
future is wider than Tom Bent. Once upon a time the
pet phrase in every prospectus was “ true fissure lode.”
If Dunn does not take care, he will be adding “ true
saddle formation ” to every mining promoters’ plant in
Vic. It was once whispered that Dunn could not stand
Bradford’s “ corrugations,” to which Professor Gregory
proffered a listening ear. Now Dunn runs the risk of
being told that he |is only phrasing under another garb
some of Bradford’s weirdly put ideas.
* * * *
Bewick, Moreing and Co. are not teaching the
Victorian alluvial idea how to shoot just yet, andjit is
by no means clear that they are many yards nearer that
objective than when they began at Moolort and Loddon
Valley. They have now got a six months’ suspen-
sion at the Moolort. This may mean almost
indefinite suspension, because the plant is to be
whipped out and put on at the Loddon Valley
to bring the lift there to 11 million gals, daily. The
funds originally subscribed have been so deeply dipped
into that Bull has had to shell out further by subscribing
to an issue of debentures, with the prospect of having to
pay calls after the end of the year, as there is not the
ghost of a chance of gold being seen by then. Economist
Curie boosted the deep leads in London just about the
time that funds were getting low'. This was, of course, a
mere coincidence ; still it caused a broad smile, because
Curie on mining is about as well informed as the Arous
mining man, who did the Loddon field only a few weeks
back, and failed to see the fly in the amber.
No one wishes to unduly interfere with enter-
prise, whether deep sinking-, deep thinking-, or deep
drinking. But the eye of investigation ought to be turned
pretty direct on the Star of the East, Sebastopol Plateau
(Vic.), to find out if that duck is doing a little moulting
at the present time, in addition to being particularly
lame. The profits which were to have come from the deep
level stone have not figured up very high in theaccounts .yet.
Attention would not be directed to this fact if it had not
been noticed that there has been a recurrence of reports
respecting stone being broken from the 2240 ft. crosscut
of the Guiding Star lode. W. H. Sewell, chairman of
directors, is credited with stating that the stone is similar
in appearance to the shoot which paiddividendsat 1000 ft.
and 1100 ft. The only question which may be put on this
assertion is, why, if there is this similarity, has the share
market never shown a move, though Ballarat people are
quicker off the mining mark than any other crowd in
Australia ?

“In view of the fact that there has been no
work done during the half-year, the usual meeting will
not be held,” the directors of the Hercules (Tas.)announce
in their report. Are the directors afraid? The last
meeting, which was held just after the strike started at
the Hercules, decided “ that it be an instruction to the
directors to take the earliest possible steps to resume
operations, if it can be profitably done.” In view of that
resolution, the fact that operations haven’t been resumed
seems to be a particularly solid reason why the ordinary
meeting should be held, so that the directors might
explain what, they did with their “instruction.”
The whole report is a wild shriek against “labor
tyranny.” The fact is that the co. tried to get
outside labor to take the place of the men whom it
locked out (co. was making a heavy wage-cut, and the
men wouldn’t agree), and when the local men explained
matters to the outsiders the latter wouldn’t go on the
mine. Thereupon the Board says: “The experience of
the Hercules Go., in being absolutely prevented from
substituting other labor for the men who chose to go on
strike, furnishes an object lesson for intending investors
in mining properties in Tasmania, as it emphasises
the fact that, in addition to the usual risks of
such ventures, the power of labor organisations
and agitators has to be taken into account.”
Quite true. Tasmania is a poor country which hasn’t
got any Arbitration Courts, and practically no Labor
laws ; so when its employers and employees have a dis-
agreement their only course is to fight it out ; and that
may hang up a mine for six months or more, and ruin
workings and machinery. The directors of the Hercules
are therefore perfectly right in pointing out that, in the
absence of Arbitration and similar laws, Tasmania is no
place for investors to put their money.
Melbourne is tin-mad. You can scarcely wan-
der along a water-course either in N.S.W. or north-
eastern Victoria without tripping over an ambassador
from Collins-street with a tin dish and a microscope.
There will be many fingers frost-bitten. The boom is all
based on the jump in the price to £152 ; and there is no
reason to expect that that price will be maintained any
more than previous high prices have been. Tin has the
most erratic of all markets ; only 10 years ago the average
for a year was under £59 10s., which represented a fall of
65 per cent, in seven years. There have frequently been
25 percent, movements in 12 months. The best proof of
the sort of gamble it is can be got from the N.S.W. tin-
output statistics. In 1874 the yield was worth
£372,777 ; in 1878 it had slumped to £214,613.
Within four years it was up to £568,795 ; three years after
it was down to £281,186. In 1888 it was £309,510,
and in 1904 only £85,264. In 1898 it was down to
£45,638, and two years afterwards it was £142,724.
Within two years of that again it was back to £59,593,
and in the next two years (1904) it had nearly quadrupled.
For a gamble nothing could be better ; for an investment,
nothing could be worse. And even the gambler might
do worse than reflect that, so far as price goes, he is
going in now on the top floor.
“Philosopher” Smith is recalled by the pay-
ment of the £2,000,000 in divs. by Mt. Bischoff. He was
not at all an eccentric, as many would make out, but a
generous, one-souled being, who had a vast faith in his
country. Every man, woman and child on the river
Forth who had ever given Smith a crust of bread or a
drink of water got some Bischoff shares, thus reaping
after many days. Apart from finding Bischoff,
“Philosopher” Smith had interests all round the
Mount. These boomed more or less, but have all long
since fizzled out or been absorbed by tbe big show. Mt.
Bischoff Go. for years and years paid £4 a ton freight to
the sea coast over the Van Diemen's Land Go.’s railway.
Considering- the distance is only 45 miles, it would pay the
co. to look round for another route to the sea ; but there
doesn’t seem to be much initiative in the Bischoff crowd.
“Philosopher” Smith married late in life and was
given a seat in Parliament. But a good hushman
often makes a poor legislator, and he lived up
to that rule. The story is not often told, but it is gene-
rally understood that thebattler had to eat his dog in his
desperate plight when he made for Wynyard after finding
Bischoff. Even then he barely got out of the bush with
his life. Some of the old timers at Bischoff were Captain
Dick, afterwards of Kalgoorlie ; Con. Lynch, diamond
miner ; Elliot, Captain Smith, W. Moore, and Quiggin.
S.A. Inspector of Mines Matthews declined to
say anything hopeful enough about that defunct wild-cat,
Arltunga, to give the Adelaide syndicate promoters a
chance. Even at the White Range, which S.A. has been
told is far superior to its neighbor, the original Arltunga,
Matthews finds the bulk average of the stone raised during
the past half-year is only lOdwt. —and consider where
Arltunga is : 425 miles from the head of the transconti-
nental line at Oodnadatta, and 1113 miles from Adelaide.
Matthews could find nothing in the shape of a true or
well-defined lode —merely veins and irregular formations,
which they pig-root; and then they pick the stone, and
as the gold occurrence is very patchy, they thus hand-
dress it up to about 25 or 30dwt. To make matters worse,
most of the country rock is desperately hard.

Following the example of the philanthropic
drapers who advertise their goods at “ less than cost
price,” a Melbourne suburban fisherman announces a
“ unique fish sale.”. ’Couta and kipper are “ sacrificed.”
Flounder flourishes at “ ridiculous prices,” and the public
is informed that “ fish of all kinds will be double size
during the sale ” —the flathead having presumably con-
sented to put on flesh “ for this week only.” Unfortu-
nately some customers have the idea that the bargains

A Cobar syndicate has taken an option over the
most promising-looking copper show (Barron’s), Wertago,
far west N.S.W. Prospectors have stuck to this field for
five years, keeping the pot boiling with occasional small
parcels of rich picked ore ; but cost of transit has been
crushing —£7 to S. Australian ports. Under more favor-
able conditions Wertago would have made considerable
stir before this; the lodes are not big, but they carry
good smelting ores.

“Whaffor”: The white miner has a big griev-
ance in the Northern Territory. The tinfields are swarm-
ing with Ohows, who work on leases taken up by Govern-
ment servants and others in Palmerston. The Chows pay
the white dummy 10 per cent., and I know of men who
have as many as 20 leases. On the fields across the Bay,
also up the Pine Creek line, you can see lease after lease
taken up in the same name and worked by Chows. Some
of the notices are stuck up upside down. Although lam
a perfect stranger in the Territory, Chows have already
approached me and asked me to lend them my name for
10 per cent, of the tin won. Although tin is now (July
27th) £l5O 15s. per ton, there are very few white miners
in the N.T., but every boat takes away truck loads of tin.
What benefit does Australia get from the cheap and nasty
Chow ? He spends nothing in the country except amongst
his own kin, and all the money goes to China. You only
want to visit the Northern Territory and Palmerston to
become convinced that cheap Chow labor is a fraud. The
Chows practically own the country, but white S. Aus.
owns the debt, which now amounts to some four millions.

MISSUS: "Get up an’ chop some wood, you lazy
wretch. I want ter make up the fire an’ get
a bite to eat.”
MISTER: “Sorry, Mariar, but I suffer fr'm a
pain in me side. It goes away after Eve ’ad
me dinner.”
“Ne’er-do-Weel”: As to blacks’ insensi-
bility to pain (“Ray,” B. 10/8/’O5). A gin, on the
Balonne, had two fingers smashed in a row with
her blackfellow. The bones were protruding, and,
as nothing was done for her hurt, her arm began
to swell, and the whole limb to look ugly. The
manager’s wife persuaded Jenny to go up to the
township and see the doctor at the hospital. It
needed a lot of persuasion, too, as Jenny could not
see the necessity for a 40-miles walk for such a
trifling hurt. When the doctor saw it he was
horrified. Tried for a couple of days to reduce the
inflammation—Jenny steadily refusing to lie up.
Then gangrene set in, and he told Jenny he’d have
to take the hand off —it was the only chance of
saving her life. I was i.i hospital at the time, and
I’ll never forget Jenny’s howls. Anyway, she
flatly refused ; and when the doctor insisted she
sulked. The operation (and the hand) was to
come off next day, but that night Jenny cleared.
Where she got to nobody knows, but she disap-
peared for three months, and then turned up at
the station as good as new, except for some scars
on her fingers and some misshapeliness.

a place for wet weather. In seven months (212

Mt. Lyell 151, and Zeehan 147. Waratah had 25
wet days in July, and Zeehan 27. Mt. Read
(where the rain falls like long fishing-rods—one
end of each stream in the burst clouds and the
other end on earth) had the greatest aggregate
rainfall for the seven months, namely, 75in.

“Janor”: That bluegum is superior to
oak and hickory for wheel-spokes was known to a
few persons many years ago. Know a man who,
after making experiments, was so sure he had a
good thing that he employed a number of men in
a Vic. forest to split out tens of thousands of
them. The mistake he made was not securing liis
market beforehand. All his efforts to sell to the
trade failed—everybody was wedded to the im-
porting lunacy. As a consequence, he dropped
much money in his attempt to develop one of
“ our great natural,” &c. I passed through that
forest not long since, and saw a number of neatly-
built stacks of these spokes, as sound (barring
sun-cracks) as when they were split, 20 years ago.

“ The Prooshan ” : It is admittedly impos-
sible to make men moral by Act of Parliament,
but surely a Bill might be introduced to prevent
euchre players thumping pub tables in the course
of their games. I paid for the luxury of a bed at
a pub in Ruinville last night. The building was
of pine, and my camp was, unfortunately, near
the battery. The “ blackfellows’ ” game is sicken-
ing enough to gaze upon at all times, but to lie in
bed and listen to it for hours is agony. “Pass ! ”
“Pass!” “By me!” “Make it, Jack,” “Oh,
well, clubs for a pint.” Then follows tire con-
tention for the first trick, then the second, but it
is in the battle tor the third or point trick that the
thumping comes. The fortissimo .crash that
accompanies the discharge of the right bower, or
haply the “joker,” shakes the building from stem
to stern, and awakens thoughts of murder and
disembowelled remains in the mind of the would-
be sleeper. Then, “I’m away,” “By me,” “She’s
down,” “Good iron, Jimmy.” Then worse
thumps, and a final thump, and a dropping of
greasy cards, and a general dissection of the game,
and hobnailed boots pounding heavily to bed.

“Ray X.” : Re desert pea (“Jimmy P.”
B. 10/8/ 05). Coming down from Oodnadatta one
day on usual fortnightly train, was lantruidly sur-
prised to find it pull up shortly after we had
started. Scraped a hole through the flies on the
window, looked out and saw guard, fireman, and
passengers making a rush towards some unknown
point off the line. Immediately scented a new
gold rush and joined in. Hardly had time to
build a castle or so in the atmosphere when I
arrived. Saw men frantically grabbing great
lumps of, not gold, but gorgeous pea-blossom, the
beauty of which is neither to be imagined nor
described.

“ Chip” : There was not another drop in
any of the bottles. The captain had upended
them twice, and I had followed suit; but, like
Mother Hubbard’s cupboard, they were bare.
The captain was inhal-
ing the flavor of one
of the corks, and both
of us cast longing eyes
on the chief’s bottle of
bugs. “Cruel shame to
see good liquor wasted
on insects,” remarked
the skipper. “Yes,” I
replied; “ but tarantula
juice, you know. Don’t
quite like the idea.” We
smoked for ten minutes
and spoke of other
things, but our gaze
always returned to that
bottle. “ Thirty over-
proof, and used to
smother a dam lot of
beetles ,! It’s fair dis-
graceful!” said the cap-
tain. More silent puffing.
“ A bit of fine muslin—
if you didn’t squeeze ’em
too hard,” he suggested.
Three minutes later we
were straining the rum
through folded mosquito-net, and
had filled up the chief’s bug bottle with cold
tea. “ The soakin’ they’ve ’ad oughter preserve
them,” the captain remarked, in justification of
our confiscation of the liquor. Whether it was
the presence of “tarantula juice” or not I am
unable to say, but I never tasted more palatable
0.P., and when I said good-night to the old
skipper, my only regret was that there was no
more of it.

“R.J.E.”: Can some one inform me (by
actual observation) what are the symptoms of
snakebite; how long were the patients in dying
from time of bite ; were they in pain ; any swel-
ling, local or general; is the effect of venom of
Australian snakes blood poisoning or nerve paraly-
sis? On the Westralian fields are some lively speci-
mens of the red-bellied tiger snake and the yellow-
bel.ied black snake (the latter a particularly vicious-
looking customer), with a very small, handsome
head and very large fangs.

MR. PUBLIC-HOUSE (notorious for the shortness of his measure):

“ F.H.R.” : A Bulletin writer says by
planting “old man” round peach trees, aphides
and other insects are kept away. An orange
orchardist tells me that gum-lea ves strewn around
the fruit trees will keep moth and other pests
away. He claims that the smell of the eucalyptus
is nauseous to such vermin.

“ F.C.” : “The Prooshan” (B. 24/8/’O5)
might confer some permanent benefit on fruit-
growers if he were less vague and cursory about
the “old man” grass that somebody’s grand-
mother found such a good preventative of aphides
in peach trees. Can he give the scientific or even
the common, every-day monniker of this weed?
He says it is “ well-known in the country.” What
part of the country ? No one that I have met round
Melbourne knows of this grass. There are plenty
of peach-trees whose stems are surrounded with
heavy growths of all sorts of grass, but the univer-
sal experience is the less the ground round the
trees is cultivated the better the aphis thrives.

“ Watty ” : Be “ San Remo ” (B. 20/7/’O5)
and the bird called the emu. In the eastern
States he may be getting scarce for zoo purposes
and as a feature in Australian scenery, but it is
not so in W.A., especially outback. If “S.R.”
was prospecting in summer with the thermometer
about 115 in the water bag, he would not champion
his pet fowl. Rock gnamma holes form the only
water catchment, and it is a frequent occurrence',
on approaching water after a hot dry stage with
men and horses parched with thirst, to find from
one to eight dead emus in what little water is
left. Why he does it I don’t know, but he does.
Such water requires repeated boiling and skimming
and is then anything but drinkable. Therefore
prospectors say the emu must go, and every time
he appears within range he gets a - 44 bullet. He
is a wonderful doer, for when fresh water is un-
procurable he quenches his thirst witli brine from
salt lakes. I have seen emus drinking out of Lake
Lefroy, which is a very salt proposition. The
bird’s two redeeming features are oil and stuffed
hind quarter.

“ Yigilans ” : In Palmerston (N.T.), it is
a common thing to see old niggers carting
round young lubras. They openly solicit,
bringing the gins into the hotels. The in-
habitants merely say it is the custom of the
country.
“Ne’er-do-Weel”: Had a somewhat
similar experience to “ Prooshan ” (B. 10/8/’O5)
in the matter of dingo-slaying. We were cattle
mustering and drafting on the Muckadilles in
’B5, and the yowls of the dingoes in the ranges at
night nearly drove us mad. The head stockman
vowed he’d get the bulk of them—dingo scalps
were worth money in those days—and, having an
off-day, he got all hands to aid him, and com-
mandeered a side of beef from the storekeeper.
There were eleven of us. The beef was cut up
into baits and poisoned, and each man given a
bag full. Also, each man was given a large and
juicy lump to trail. At daybreak every man
made for a different place in the ranges, and then
rode to a given point on the bank of a waterhole
near the camp. Each man trailed a lump of beef
after him, and at intervals threw out baits,
skewering them out of the bag on a pointed stick.
At the waterhole a big lump of beef was hung in
a tree, just within reach of a dog jumping at it.
Next morning we found 15 stiffened dingoes round
that tree. We got a pound each for the scalps
from the station, and 10s. from the Board.
“The Prooshan”: I knew an old whim
horse named Brewer, employed raising stock
water on Nap Nap station, that could show our
State Treasurers a point or two in intelligence,
No driver was needed, for, as soon as the full
bucket reached the bumper at the top, a knock
was given, and the concussion operating on the
bucket trigger released the water. The moment
Brewer heard the knock, he stopped dead and
listened till the last drop of water was out. I hen
l l ® reversed to let the empty bucket down, another
full one rising as it descended. Promptly at the
knock he stopped again till the outflow was tom-
pleted, then off the other way, and thus on till
the 10,000 gallon tami was filled. At that point
Brewer stopped and worked no more, but waited
the station hand came and took him out. How
“ e could time the filling of that tank was aim s-
tery to m e ; Fancy he must have multiplied the
, gallons in the bucket by the knocks anyhow,
‘ le never had a deficit, and he always made the
f' vo sid ® s °f the account balance. Brewer was a
glutton for damper, and the only time I knew him
f° , fl ° afc a lo , a » was , he invaded the men’s
huti knocked the lid off the camp oven, and went
awa ! with the loaf in his teeth .

"GENTLEMAN” FARMER (late of the Smashed Bank,

the dashed thing!”
“ S.R.” : If the ’roo’s jump has not been
cot off in its prime—on Gordon Downs . station
(Central Q.), in 1887, I measured a ’roo jump that
I reckon will lift the belt. ’Roo cleared a flooded
creek at one bound. Measured creek, and found
it, bank to bank, 43ft. Allowing 3ft. for take-
off and landing, this jump beats Harm' Stock-
dale’s 41ft. The same’roo jumped a 6ft. netting
fence like a bird. Talking of jumps—fear will
break records every time. Once I sailed over a
6ft. fence wafted on the breath of an irritated
bull. Couldn’t clear 4ft. 6in. for a thousand sovs.,
bat a man never knows what’s in him till he’s
pushed by a beastly big beast with horns.
SUNDAY MORNING AT THE SHED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Scent of quondongs and of maple, with the spring sun
shining clear ;
Rustle of the glinting box-leaves, drowse of busy bees
a-near ;
Far away a cautious emu, further still, a string of sheep,
And beside me, in the sunshine, half-a-dozen men asleep.
At the well a few are washing—soap-foam, from their
bronzed arms bare,
Gleaming bright as pipe-blown bubbles in the scented
sunny air.
Ah ! the work to them is irksome—soak and lather, rub
and wring !
But—a garment clean and wholesome is a wondrous
pleasant thing.
Some beside the hut are smoking, idle groups upon the
ground
Spinning yarns of doubtful morals with an interest pro-
found ;
And their laughter mingles strangely with the voices from
inside —
“ Twelve’s the main ! ” “ The ace I tell you ! ” “ Blow me!
You have got a hide ! ”
But the shed is very quiet; only through the open door
Comes the twitter of the swallows nesting ’bove the cap-
stan floor ;
Yet, within, as mute as convicts in the chapel of a gaol,
Is the group of weary cookies making ready for the mail.
Ah ! their hands are rough and horny where the shear-
hafts mostly dwell,
And the spluttering- pens keep kicking at the words that
will not spell,
And the lines that struggle upward through the blots
that come to stay,
Only seem to tell a tittle of the things they meant to say.
But their pain will be rewarded when the spells at smoke-
ho come,
And their thoughts go swinging outward to the little
rustic home,
For, perchance, they’ll see the kiddies rushing in with
«• faces glad ;
Hear them shouting, “Mother! mother! here’s a letter
come from dad ! ”
On the sandhill someone’s singing, someone hidden by the
trees ;
Oh ! the notes are full of joyance and of wild bush sym-
phonies,
And they set me dreaming, dreaming of the ways my feet
have trod,
Till I walk through fields of Fancy in the golden Land of
Nod.
Ah ! ’tis sweet, oh city sing-er, in the scented, sunny air—
What was that ?—“ You blanky liar ! Why I beat you with
a pair ! ”
“ Fow? you (something mostly blanky) come outside, you
blanky cow !
Come outside, or, by the Eternal I’ll just belt your hide off
now ! ”
“ Time ! ” and “ Time ! ” again is shouted to the ready
ring-side law;
Then a cry as little Bunty swings a right home on the
jaw.
“ Good boy, Bunty!” “Give him air, lads!” “On the
point the cut is deep.”
But no sound hears Queensland Billy ; limply there he
lies —asleep.
Billy wakes, and w’ondrous battles of the grey and hoary
past
Are remembered and recounted, each one fiercer than the
last,
Till a horseman from the homestead breaks into the
bloodiest tale
With the ever-welcome greeting—“ Hornin’ chaps; I’ve
brought yer mail.”
Some a wife and some a mother, some the sweetest girl of
all-
Does it matter for the moment who may fight and who
may fall ?
This we know who live and labor where the long coach
routes prevail,
There’s a little glimpse of Heaven in the coming of the
mail.

“C.8.H.” : After reading an account in
The Bulletin of a man who caught wild pigs by
the leg and tied them, I had a bad attack of
doubts. In the 90’s, on the Culgoa and Balonne
Ri< ers, Queensland, we often used to organise
“ pig-pricking” expeditions. Ihe weapon was a
shear-blade mounted on a rake-handle. I irearms
were barred. The pigs were fairly plentiful and
gave good sport, seldom running far; the boars
and old sows preferred to pull up after the first
couple of furlongs and take the option of an argu-
ment. The man who was willing to get off and
catch them by the leg wasn’t camping with us
that time. If he had been, we should have tied
him up and left him in camp out of regard for his
mother’s feelings. When pigs make trouble the
victim is not a cheerful spectacle after it is over.
A well-grown pig is tremendously powerful. If
caught on the run and given a thrust between the
shoulders or in the spine, he shuts up quickly.
But, after being scratched, he usually backs
up against a tree, and charges freely till over-
come by wounds and exhaustion. A quick horse
is essential, as several gashed hocks were sus-
tained by mounts that dwelt at the critical
moment. It is a good sport ; the best probably
that the Commonwealth can offer. And the
glutton for danger can usually be accommodated
by a big boar in a lignum patch.

“ Platman ” : “ Itan ” (B. 10/8/’95) says
the Chinaman in Cairns (N.Q.) must be faced.
Well, it will soon take a good many to face him.
One boss N.Q. Chow had his family photographed
some time ago. The group consisted of papa,
three mammas, and sixteen children —nine girls
and seven boys. Since then he lias added to his
responsibilities by importing another wife and
celebrating the birth of four more children.
Why, if a Europem marries two wives he gets
seven years for bigamy. ’Tis the old story in this
country; the alien gets all the encouragement,
from growing cabbages to raising babies.

From the Illustrated London News
(25/7/’57); —
An Extraordinary Batch of Convicts.—On Monday,
notice was given at Lloyds that Her Majesty’s Govern-
ment required a ship immediately to convey 400 male
convicts from England to Fremantle, Western Australia.
Perhaps a more remarkable set of convicts never left the
country at one time than will go out in this ship. Among
the 400 will be found Sir John Dean Paul, the fraudulent
banker ; Robson, the Crystal Palace forger ; Redpath,
who committed the forgeries on the Great Northern
Railway Company; and Agar, who was connected with
the great gold-dust robbery on the South-Eastern railway.
The notorious bank forger, barrister Saward, alias Jim
the Penman, the putter-up of all the great robberies in
the metropolis for the last 20 years, also goes out in this
ship, which will leave England on the 25th proximo,
embarking convicts at Deptford, then the Little Nore,
Portsmouth, Portland, and Plymouth.

“ Alec Zander ”: Re country habit of
calling afternoon “evening.” Stopping down the
N.S.W. South Coast, amongst the cow-folk, I was
once asked by a farmer to call round tomorrer
evenin’ and see the missus and the girls (Mariar
could play the pianner some and Julia could sing
middlin’), and have a pitch. Thinking to give the
women time to finish washing up after tea, I didn’t
call till nearly eight. To my astonishment I
found the place in darkness and the family (with
the exception of the dogs) apparently out. Meet-
ing my friend next day, he asked me why I didn’t
call as promised. On my explaining he said I’d
made a mistake ; he didn’t mean at night, but in
the evenin’. Further conversation revealed that,
as the family rose early to do the milking, they
usually retired about seven, and their idea of
evening was two or three o’clock.
SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.
NEWCASTLE, Thursday Night.—A heavy swell is
still rolling in on the bar.
“ H.S.R.” on some natural history points :
There are eels in western waters ; at least, there are in
the Severn. They have been caught at Banger’s Valley,
and the skins may he seen at any time in Emmaville. I
have seen an eel caught at Barney Downs wriggling on
the grass after a heavy fall of rain. That would be not
very far from Tenterfield. It is also said there are no cod
in eastern waters, but there are plenty in the Clarence.
Also, somebody says the paddymelon, or wirrah, is the
same as the scrub wallaby. He is a distinct animal, and
does not frequent scrubs, but is partial to sandalwood
country and lives in logs, and will always get into one if
possible when pursued. Any dog will eat kangaroo rat
with relish, but not bandicoot.
# * * *
“ Bang ” : In the dense scrubs in this dis-
trict (Bangalow) there are vast quantities of
lawyer-vines—useful in furniture, basket-making,
etc. —but there is no attempt made to save them.
The whole scrub is taken in a face in the clearing
process, and everything destroyed. It seems
strange that there is not a payable market for
this cane.

“Paul Cupid” : Two runaway sailors asked
MacPherson for a job. He wanted his corn pulled,
and asked them how m uch an acre they’d pull it
for. They concealed their total ignorance of the
work by leaving the price to him. He engaged
them at once at tucker, 4s. an acre and help load.
He showed them the corn paddock, and told them
to start at the far side and make the heaps about
10 yards apart. That night he inquired how they
got on. They complained about it being hard
work, and likened it to hauling on a wire hawser
all day. He said they’d soon get used to it. For
two days he kept away from them lest they might
want to leave. The third night they complained
to him that their hands were too raw to do any
more. He gave them some old socks to put on
their hands, and, as an incentive, handed them £l,
and promised them 6s. an acre if they went on.
Next day at noon he rode down to see how they
were progressing. When he viewed the field his
hair stood up and lifted his hat off. He saw great
heaps of stalks with the cobs attached pulled out
by the roots and packed in order, and the two
sailors in the distance attached to a single stalk
and hauling at it as if its roots had gone right
down to Tophet, and Old Nick, with a battalion of
departed importers, was hanging on to them.
When it did give way, their heels described wild
semicircles in the atmosphere and their remarks
were brief but emphatic. Never did a hare-kneed
Highlander give vent to more dreadful yells of
anger and emphasis than those that alarmed the
sailors as Mac. bore down on them at full gallop.
For five minutes the place seemed as if a demented
whirlwind had struck it. The two sailors got on
the port tack and retreated in disorder through
the maize. Then the victor thought of the £1 he
had given them and the tucker they had eaten,
and he sat on a heap of cornstalks and wept.

“Dodd Mobb ” : Abdul Wade, the camel-
owner, is having trouble in North Queensland.
Ten camels lately died from eating the ironwood
tree. Now the beasts have to be fed on com-
pressed fodder, instead of foraging for them-
selves. Abdul says: “Camel driving is like
everything else, it requires experienced men.
You cannot make a European out of a Chinaman;
and you cannot make a camel-driver of an
Englishman. The best drivers are Afghans.
Chinese, Hindus, aboriginals and Europeans have
all been tried without success.” Well, I say this
in reply. My years outback have taught me (1)
that the Afghan camel-conductor is the cruellest
brute in the Commonwealth; (2) that the bush-
bred Australian can handle and manage camels
better than Abdul Sooghee Bhag and colored co.—
but, of course, he wants a white man’s living
wage. The bushman can drive camels further,
can get more work out of the sinuous, sinful
beasts, and can make them live and last longer
than the best of the beastly batch of Afghans and
other aliens.

“ Jimmie Pannikin” : Have noticed during
twelve months’ travelling W est-o’-Darling that
two alleged characteristics of those parts don’t
exist —strong language and strong tea. Even
graphically told stories are seldom garnished with

being allowed to stew for hours in the billy, is
made freshly j ust when wanted.
Crip p s
Clark ap-
pears for
th’e defend-
ant :
In his im-
pressions of
Tasmania, Ro-
bert Brothers
makes no men-
tion of the
n o t e w o rthy
fact that Ho-
bart has, in
spite of its re-
putation for
health, more
chemi s t s’
shops than
any other city
of its size.
Nearly all the
best corner
sites are occu-
pied by chem-
ists, and most
of the build-
ing's between
are filled with
lawyers, ex-
cept those which hap-
pen to be pubs. Yet,
with all these indica-
tions of sin, there are
barely a dozen police-
men—mostly fossils—
to keep order. I have
seen half-a-dozen men-
o’-warsmen hold up
Murray-street u util
taken off by a guard
from the warships.
Can’t confirm B. li.’s
statement that Tas-
mania is the most h-'.ess
State in Australasia.
As a rule, the T; i-
manians, especially
the rural population,
are bred from better
stock than the pci pie
of the mainland.
They may “ desire to
be as English as possible ” simply because a great
number of them are the children of British naval and
military officers who settled there. It is not uncom-
mon to see an old naval captain making his own butter
up for the market —and very good butter, too.
The homesteads in Tassy are far more comfortable than
the average farmer in N.S.W. enjoys. Mostly solid-look-
ing buildings of dressed stone, with stable! and barns to
match. The roads, too, make a visitor from the mainland
green with envy. The payments made by selectors to
the Government for the first two or three years are spent
in providing roads —good enough for bike tracks—to the
nearest main road, no matter in what sort of an out-of-
the-way corner the selectors settle. Granted that there
is a big Doiery element in the Tasmanian Parliament,
backed up by a daily press t lat hasn’t emerged from the
politics of the Stone Age, Tassy is ahead of N.S.W. in the
matter of local government, and even Hobart is up-to-date
with motor omnibuses.
I spent 15 months prospecting the island with a view to
an investment, and everywhere was hospitably received.
The only fault was that the men on the land there have
the same lofty ideas concerning tiie value of it as they
have of their reputation for hospitality. One fine old
gentleman on the East Coast was so afraid that any tourist
might pass his door without calling that he advertised in
the Hobart Mercury that his kettle was kept on the boil,
as of yorg, for visitors, and hoped they wouldn’t pain him
by scooting'past. But I have often heaved the brick if
disapprobation at the filthy sanitary arrangements of
Hobart, and the refusal of the ruling powers therein to
expend any money in cleaning up its dirty streets. “We
can only afford to do that in the tourist season,” is the
usual excuse. That the Tasmanian Parliament, more
especially the Upper House, contains some almost
incredibly ignorant Conservatives is true—and it is truly
reflected by the leading daily paper. Yet, curiously
enough, on my last visit “ petrified Conservatism and
self-satisfied ignorance ” was the verdict bestowed upon
N.S.W. when I informed the up-to-date Tasmanians
that the Cornstalk fruitgrowers themselves helped to bar
the legislation that would enable them to hold their own
in their own market against the importations from the
despised “ Flyspeck.”

“ Bowyang ” : “Fal-
der’s” article on bullock-
driving (B. l/6/’O5) reminds
me that although bulls are
not a success in a team,
they’re very useful single-
handed. Knew a Salvarmy
chap at Port Augusta
(S.A.) who used to drive
one in a dray, using a
horse-collar reversed in
place of a bow. Also some
years ago a selector near
Pish Creek (South Gipps-
land) always rode a bull to
and from the township to
his selection. Worked a
stag poler once (his name
wasn’t Bent) who had a
natural disinclination to
work, and developed the
peculiarity of planting him-
self when indisposed for
toil. He would lie close in
to a log and watch the rest
of the team being hunted
up to yoke, and so success-
fully did he hide in the
Gippsland forest country
that we had more than
once to get a substitute for
the day. At Mt. Gipps
station, beyond Broken
Hill, a party of tank-
sinkers had a leading bul-
lock who invariably refused
to go further once the cook
had indicated dinner by
whanging the camp-oven
lid with a piece of iron.
As to black bullocks —at
Cockburn (S.A.) once saw a
team of 16 of them. They
were well-conditioned and
picturesque, though some-
what funereal. I wonder
some enterprising corpse-planting firm hasn’t inno-
vated in this direction.

Melville Island (N.T.), after ten years’
rest, is seeing great slaughter among the buffaloes.
There are supposed to be 20,090 there ; and a few
white men are killing at the rate of 150 per week.
“Viking”: I have often killed fish with
dynamite in the pools of coastal creeks. The
method generally employed was to place the plug
in a weighted and corked pickle bottle, light the
fuse, and throw the bottle to the centre of the pool.
The explosion of a similar plug not enclosed in a
bottle was not, as far as I could judge from the
earth tremor of the bank, as powerful as when a
bottle was used. Once, when cleaning a perch
killed in this way, I found a considerable quantity
of escaped blood amongst the viscera. That fish
was undoubtedly killed by the explosion. Pro-
bably it was near the charge when it went off.
Generally, as Kooka ” says, the fish are only
stupefied and soon recover the power of motion,
although for a time they can only swim weakly
about the surface. Ido not think the gases of the
explosion have anything to do with the matter.
The concussion does the work. Once I dived ii.to
a deep pool, when what I thought was an explosion
happened. I came to the surface half stupid and
abused my mates for firing dynamite. They had
merely dropped a 201 b. stone about ten feet from
where I was. 13id not tell them my sensations, hut
on our next swimming excursion I came provided
with an ordinary “ hunger ” cracker and weighted
bottle. Used it in the same way as a dynamite
cartridge when the boys were swimming under
water. They came up pretty quickly, and, as I
was quite nude and unfit to make .a bolt, copious
explanations were necessary. When peace was
established I noted their sensations, which were
the same as my own on the former occasion,
namely, a feeling of having been struck on
both sides of the head, singing in the ears
(which continued for minutes after reaching the
surface), involuntary opening of the mouth, and a
desire to come to the surface at once and see that
the globe was still there.

“ Petramos ” : Standing on the kerb,
whistling the ‘’Dead March” and waiting for an
Adelaide tram, heard two men greet each other:—
“Hallo!” “Hallo!” “How’s things?” “Not too
bad.” “ Wife all right ? ” “No; snuffed out Tuesday.”
“ Well, strike me ! Good-bye.” “ ’Bye.”
I tried to think of something more cheerful to
whistle.

“ D.H.R.” : Awful is the fate of the non-
mining man who strikes a mining township. Put
up one night at Broken Hill. At dinner-time,
everyone talked mines in leaden voices with a
trace of zinc in them. I sat silent, but presently
arnui, with his mouth full of pickles, turned to
me and asked me what I thought of the lead in
Shock 10, or some mine like that. I replied that
I hadn’t seen it, and he went off into a loud
guffaw, and grabbed wildly for the cheese. Then
he Slid that 1 must be a blessed new-chum or a
somnambulist. I said I was both, also an anti-
Socialist, a prohibited immigrant, a believer in
Piebald Cole legislation, a relative of King
Edward, an American millionaire, and an old age
pensioner, and that I was thinking of taking up
the land-agency business and combining it with
astronomy and boot-repairing. All this I said to
try and keep the conversation off mines, but I
found no one was listening to me. They were all
talking stocks and robberies and tailings with
frenzied eagerness, and in my disgust I went
forth with the cruet in my hand and fell down a
shaft.

ANOTHER LIFE SAVED.
Mrs. L. Player, Newcastle,
Cured After Doctors Failed.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.
EVERYONE thought my days were num-
bered,” said Mrs. Louisa Player,
Georgina Terrace, 49 Wolfe-street,
Newcastle. “But Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills saved me from the grave. They made me
strong and healthy when the best doctors in New
South Wales gave me up. My cure is a down-
right Miracle.
“ Yes, Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills worked a
miracle when they cured me,” added Mrs.
Player. “All Newcastle knows how hope-
lessly ill I was, for I have lived here nearly
thirty years. I always had excellent health
till three or four years ago. Then, just after
my little girl was born, I caught a severe
cold. It clung to me, and soon wrecked my whole
health. The nerves in my face and head seemed
all on fire with Neuralgia, which pierced me
through and through with sharp spasms of agony,
then Rheumatism settled in my joints and spine
paralysing every movement. Dreadful darting
pains started in the back of my neck, and ran like
lightning all over my head. Even when they
eased up, they left behind a dull, heavy pain that
nearly drove me mad. I used to press my head
against the iron bed-post to get relief. My neck
was so stiff that I could not look round without
turning my whole body. My right arm swelled
and had strange pains like Paralysis, as if there
were a thousand pins dug into it. I dared not
move it, even to do a bit of sewing. I could never
sleep soundly, and even when I dozed the pain
woke me with a start and almost made me scream.
I had no appetite, no heart, no hope, no happiness
in life.
“Every day I grew weaker. The doctors did
their best for me, and I had every care at home—
but, in spite of everything, I grew worse and
worse. I tried every remedy I heard of, but they
were all useless. Nothing eased my splitting
headaches, nothing seemed able to give me a drop
of good red blood. Death would have come to me
then only as a glad release. I generally managed
to get up in the morning, but I was afraid to go
out. One day, when shopping, I was seized by a
strange fit of paralysing weakness, and nearly fell
through the plate-glass window of Robb’s drapery
shop in Hunter Street. I had to stagger home,
doubled up with pain. My heart was jumping
and thumping. After that, these fits came often
like strokes of Paralysis. Each one was worse
than the last. I sank down in a swoon wherever
I stood. More than once my husband came home
to find me lying death-like on the floor.
“ I was just giving up hope,” Mrs. Player went
on, “when I read about a woman who was cured
by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills after she suffered just
the same way. I bought at once three boxes of
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills from Hart and Firkin,
the local chemists. After taking them for a few
days, they brought down a great clot of blood
through my nostiils. It must have been pressing
on my brain, for it relieved me wonderfully. I
picked up heart at once. I know now that Dr.
Williams Pink Pills touched just the right spot—
my blood. Every dose seemed to put new life
into me. My nerves grew strong and steady, and!
I suffered no more from the darting, burning*
piercing pains of Neuralgia. Gradually the dull
ache left my head, and my joints got free of
Rheumatism. Then my spine became strong—
and after that I had no more fainting fits. My
eyes grew bright and my face got a healthy color.
Now I am as strong and well as any woman in the
neighborhood.”
In order to add force to her words, Mrs. Player
then swore to the facts of her illness and cure
before the Mayor of Newcastle, Mr. William
Cann, J.P. Her case is a miracle. It baffled
doctor after doctor. In the end Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills cured her just as they cure all diseases
that are caused by bad blood. In fact, they actu-
ally make new blood. They do just that one thing
—but they do it well. They don’t act on the
bowels. They don’t bother with mere symptoms.
They won’t cure any disease that isn’t caused
originally by bad blood. But that is the cause of
all common ailments, such as aneemia, decline,
general weakness, backaches, headaches, indiges-
tion, rheumatism, neuralgia, sciatica, partial par-
alysis, and locomotor ataxia. If offered a substi-
tute, send for the genuine to the Dr. Williams’
Medicine Co., Sydney—2s. 9d. per box, six boxes

advice will be answered free.

Cardinal Moran and N.S.W. Chief Justice

Thos. Must, who died the other day at
South Portland (Vic.), aged 92, represented Port-
land in the Victorian Assembly in ’73. He arrived
in Sydney in ’33, and subsequently took to mer-
cantile and pastoral pursuits at Portland.
Melbourne Age’s offer of Bent as a conso-
lation gift to Sydney is against the canons. Pre-
sents are not taken back. As Bent vvas born in
the neighborhood of Sydney, he may be fairly
looked on as that city’s gift to Melbourne.

Mr. Cecil West Darley, brother of N.S.W.
Chief Justice, and consulting engineer for N.S.W.
in London, has retired, owing to ill-health, from
the Service, which he entered in 1867. The post
will probably not be filled again. It has long
been more or less of a sinecure.
A man known as Professor Howard, author
of “The Art of Reckoning,” a book on arith-
metic, died in Victoria a few weeks ago. Years
back Howard beat Tom Bent in the contest for a
small billet in the Moorabbin Shire, out Brighton
way ; salary £4O a year. Land booming paid
Bent better than arithmetic paid Howard.
District Court Judge Mansfield, of Queens-
land, who passed out last week, came from legal
stock ; his grandfather, James Mansfield, was an
English Judge. The late Judge first came into
prominence when he was appointed chairman of
the Robb arbitration case, in which the plaintiff
obtained £20,000 out of a £250,000 claim against
the State. He got his Judgeship in 1898. Unlike
Justice Real, who chatters more than counsel,
Mansfield seldom spoke on the Bench. When he
did he always said something worth saying. For
years before his death he suffered from a hopeless
internal complaint.

That R. D. Meagher didn’t make very

fact that he has been for years anxious to. be

Three notabilities of various kinds died
last week. John M'Farland, electrical engineer,
aged 65 years. He came to Australia in the old
Great Britain steamer, married in the same year,
settled in Balmain, and resided in that suburb for
the rest of his life. George Maiden, Sydney
native, aged 64 years. He took early to pastoral
pursuits, founded the firm of Maiden, Hill and
Clark, now Hill, Clark and Co., and died Sydney
manager of Goldsbrough, Mort and Co. The third
deceased, H. W. L. Holt, for many years railway
station-master at Waratah, distinguished himself
as a swimmer and life-saver at Newcastle. In
1872 Governor Hercules Robinson presented him
with a medal on behalf of the Government for his
life saving. He was in his 60th year, and had the
rescue of over 20 drowning people to his credit.
A member of the Federal Reps, is jealous
of his reputation as an orator and a wit, and used
to be always the first to rush the files of imported
comic papers in search of inspiration. A jealous
dog played the miscreant trick once of ostenta-
tiously bringing in Puck when the eloquent
and humorous one was speaking and affecting
to laboriously check off his jokes. This
prompted the orator to a great effort. He
sought aid from a friend. ‘‘Brother,” he /
said, “I speak to-night. I want you
to help me. Now I’ll say this ” —giving
a cue—-“and I want you to say this.
Later on I’ll say this ” —another cue—
“and you’ll say this.” Thus the /
orator arranged for five interjec-
tions, to each of which he had a
rarely humorous and most
deadly extempore retort. He
didn’t tell his friend what
the retorts were to be. Gaily
he sailed along to the first cue.
The interjection came, and the
beautiful crushing, insulting
retort was greeted with howls
of delighted laughter. But it
didn’t please the crushed inter-
jector, who, when the next cue
came, said never a word. The
nonplussed orator went back on
his tracks and came up to the cue
agai n with a pleading look at his
friend. But the amenities of
friendship had been exhausted.
“ No fear,” yelled the interjector,
“ you don’t get me that way a
second time.”
Impecuniosity has been so
much identified with politics in
N.S. Wales that it has become almost
a guarantee of political capacity. A
venerable gentleman, now out of the
hauls of Legislature, was returned on one
occasion because his gas had been cut off.
“ And,” he would conclude his stirring
speeches to the electors, “and, while I was
in my place defending the great interests
of the people confided to my char-r-rge, the
injurious villains, minions of a usurping and
tyrannous monopoly, came and cut off the gas.”
He was triumphantly returned. No constituency
could refuse a candidate whose gas had been cut
off.
Governor Le Hunte, who was lately crying
out in very inferior grammar for nigger labor, has
been in the nigger line all his official life, and
knows no other kind of existence. Ilis first job
was at Fiji. Then he went round the islands,
part of the time as boss of native constabulary,
and passed thence to Dominica, Mauritius, Bar-
badoes, and New Guinea. Now in 8. Australia
he misses his beloved nigger, and refuses to be
comforted.
Sam Copley, Westralia’s cattle
king, credited with having made close on
a quarter of a million since his arrival in
the Sandy State, less than 15 years ago,
is a middle-aged Yorkshireman. He
started money making when a youngster
of 10 or 11. In his native village he
Worked as latherer and handy boy in a
barber’s shop at which the miners got
their chewing tobacco. He noticed that
when the customers were on their way
to early morning shifts the shops were
not open, sa he decided to start a place
of his own. The desperately energetic
kid was only about 11 when lie went into
business as tobacconist, and by opening
as early as 3.30 a.m. he captured a large
share of the trade. He prospered and
enlarged his business, selling out subse-
quently at a big price. Then he went out
to Westralia and commenced in the
same line, and with the same frenzied
energy, at Fremantle. He foresaw the
gold boom and made extensive purchases
of sand patches all around Perth, which
to-day are worth an enormous sum. Then
he turned his attention to the Kimberley
district, forming the north-western corner
of Westralia, and bought out one
squatter after another—his holdings now
run into many millions of acres of fine
pastoral country. He has about 100,000
head of cattle running in the Sturt Creek
and Ord River country, and, to get them
down to the goldfields without the long
and expensive sea trip, a new overland
route is being opened up. Ip addition to
everything else Copley has just started a
slaughtering and preserving establish-
ment at Fremantle, and he looks like a
map who might yet start a new universe.
S. Australia’s old politician, Ebenezer
Ward, still finds the world very hard. At latest
he was in a N, Adelaide hospital, and his troubles
there will probably delay the publication of his
“ Reminiscences.” Ward is very ancient now.
It is 41 years since he went as clerk or accountant
with the Finniss exploring expedition to the N.
Territory.
A MATERIAL DIFFERENCE.
The good , kind father, coming upon his little
son wailing dolorously over a broken jug, had
sympathised, and told him wisely how vain it was
to cry over spilt milk. “ Bu-bu-but this was the
beer,” replied the boy. Here the artist takes up
the story.
Melbourne is getting again into the throes
of discussion as to who’s to be Mayor, Pleasance
having declined to stand again. A quiet fellow,
he got full up .of the prandial business. He
moved from his nice little home near Como, South
Yarra, to a big mansion on St. Kilda-road, but he
will be back again as quickly as possible into a
snuggery. Whilst being a Mayor is so much
flummery and so little real work, sensible men
get tired of the job.
W. A. McArthur, Liberal Whip of the
House of Commons, now visiting Australia, is a
native^ of Sydney. The first Australian McArthur,
Captain John, who was called to London in con-
nection with the violent deposition of Governor
Bligh by the N.S.W. Corps, canvassed for a seat
in the Commons while the trial proceeded, and
only for Joseph Banks would have settled down
to English politics. The botanist held a low
opinion of the rum captain.
Although the Melba of the vigorous pro-
mises doesn’t seem inclined to do anything for
her. Miss “Mignonette” Clarke, whose light
warble was much belauded what time her pa was
Governor of Victoria, has not abandoned her idea
of an operatic career. After study with De Reszke
in Paris, she tried for the good offices of managers,
but in vain. The continental opera director is
generally a rogue and a shark, and he wants to be
paid for giving the aspirant a chance. There is
said to be some possibility of her turning her
attention to the English comic opera stage,|
“Melb,” : It appears that European skilled
labor is to -be obtained to re-start the Maffra
(Gippsland) beet sugar factory. Will anything
ever be made of Murray Ross’s immense deserted
factory at Rosstown, near Caulfield racecourse ?
He built it about 30 years ago, or more, for beet
sugar manufacture, the beet to be grown around,
tie even had a special railway constructed from
Elsternwick, about three miles, and it is there yet.
Premier Seddon turned up at an official
“hop,” at Wellington (M.L.), lately, and was the
most remarkable figure in the room. He wore a
large flowing scarlet mantle over an academic
gown, with a peculiar sort of student’s cap to com-
plete the picture. It was his first appearance in
clothing of this sort, although it’s some time since
he had an honorary degree palmed on to him.
Sitting in repose he looked like ye old Englyshe
Kynge.
“Salt”: The only sensible thing I ever
heard about Kaiser Wilhelm : When he visited
the saloon of the new Atlantic steamer Furst
Bismarck, he said, “ Round off those stupid
a.igular corners of the tables.” Done.
William Pearson, dead the other day aged
76, was a member of the first exploring party to
the Northern Territory, under B. T. Finniss. The
party had a rough time, and Pearson was speared
by the blacks. He was also one of the party which
surveyed the dividing line between N.S.W. and
S.A., and was camped for a month beside the out-
crop which later blossomed into Broken Hill. He
retired from the civil service in .1904, after 40
years of it.
S. Australian ex-Premier Butler is per-
vading the land like a dismal shadow, wailing
“’E stole me policy.” It reminds of some
stranded barnstormers who couldn’t get away
from the little bush town because the “East
Lynne” season had frozen hard, and their traps
had been detained by Air. Public-house for unpaid
board. They stood on the pavement before the
hotel, and every now and then one would insert
his head and say, dolorously, “Gimme me
clothes ! ” And their tone was just like Butler’s.
The Rutledge brothers are men of many
changes. Their father, a Parramatta schoolmaster,
brought them up as strict Methodists; but Arthur,
the eldest, after a few years’ missionary work,
gave up the church and took to law, and got as far
as being invited to form a Government. The
second, Dr. Rutledge, gave up Methodism and
took to Anglicanism. Finally, Woolls, who once
suffered under the delusion that he had a call to
be a newspaper man, quitted the inkbottle for the
Methodist pulpit, and began to see snakes about
the “ encroachments of Rome.”
By the death of William St. Paul Gelli-
brand, Tasmania loses probably its foremost
retrogressionist. No one was ever more' to the
front in going backward than Gellibrand. He was
a Doderyite of a more pronounced type than
William Dodery himself, and endeavored to
block every measure which made for progress.
He objected to stagnation. He didn’t want
a mere insufficient motionlessness ; he wanted to
go right back to antiquity. Even the Tasmanian
Parliament got tired of him at last, and he lost
his seat and went away to herd mentally with
Noah.
“ Dareel ” writes :
Re that Glengarry-capped crank (B. 31/8/’O5). In one op
the late droughts he struck an out nor-west station, and.
persuaded the boss (Parklands) that he was a water-,
diviner. He talked so rationally on the subject, that
Parklands swore he had the Ace at last. The Ace asked!
for a free hand in the blacksmith’s shop, and burned and
banged there almost round the clock. Finally the boss-
went down at midnight and suggested a spell. The Ace-
cursed him for spoiling, at tile critical moment, the
making of a watch, the size of an apple seed, which wasi
to foretell earthquakes, the time the wearer would be.-
killed, next week’s weather, and the date, and. the agri-
cultural prospects. Then he threw up the billet with,
sledge-hammer accompaniments, and left. He got the-
billet of blacksmith to an adjacent pub. Any crank cam
get that job. The publican regarded the Ace as quite ai
humorous addition to the house. His curses on royalties,
introduced a new profanity, but Bung’s sense of humor
wore out suddenly when one day the Ace shouted for the
crowd and put a handful of clover-leaves down in pay-
ment. His book of work done showed, most of us as
debtors for “ crosscut saws to cut ou.t -watch-springs” at,
£4O each. Had made three a day, according to the
entries Last saw the Ace, well-dressed, Glengarry and
all, near Mrs. Macquarie’s. Chair, cursing the royal family
with much vigor.
Yic. Premier Rjeffij was. a quaint sight at
the woman’s suffrage meeting held at Brighton,
the other night, with the deliberate intention of
converting the sitting member. He sat in a con-
spicuous place, a broad, vast, heavy politician
with the general aspect of an impassive heathen
idol, and the ladies on the platform acted as if
there vvas no other audience present, and poured
all their eloquence out at the feet of the mighty
and meaty Premier. They appealed to him ten-
derly, touchingly, passionately, beseechingly, and
with cold logic, and Tommy was unwieldy and
unyielding through it all, and rose to go with an
air that seemed to say, “ Never touched me.” The
women had thought to move Bent to tack the
adult suffrage idea on to an Appropriation Bill,
but Bent is a difficult person to move. He can
scarcely move himself without the assistance of a
motor car nowadays.
Concerning the Tunks family :
The representative of an old Australian name, Miss
Alice May Tunks, stood up before Rev. H. Tate (her '
uncle) and the “Bishop of Parramatta,’’ Archdeacon-,
Gunther, one of the oldest O. of E. clergymen—he has
been in Parramatta since IS6B—at the oldest church in,,
Australia—St. John’s, Parramatta—to be wedded to Mr. J.
Chalmers, of Newcastle, one day last week. The original
Tunks, who spelled his name Tonks, came to N.S. Wales
about 1790 as a full private in the Rum-selling Corps,
and had a grant of land on the Hawkesbury in 1795.
The second Tunks generation settled in Parramatta,
and another of the family kept the Carriers’ Arms,
in the early forties, at the N.E. corner of Castlereagh- '
street and Bathurst-street. The most notable of the Tunks ;
was the stalwart William, who resided at North Shore,
and represented the district for many years in Parlia-
ment. This Tunks was a famous cricketer, and wielded ;
a bat with an iron handle. The widow of the ex-M.L.A..
still resides on the Shore, and must be versfing on her ■
century.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, September 19, 1905.
My Dear Arini.—
Thebe s a scheme afoot for having a great flower
festival in Hyue Park as soon as its electric
lighting is completed. For space of two Floren-
tine nights the fete will endure. You will drive
through the park in your decorated motor-car, or
your enamelled wheelbarrow or other vehicle and
pelt the crowd and be pelted with flowers, and you
will listen to the band, or stroll around on foot
and watch other merrymakers at the buffets drive
the knife into the blushing ham and dash the bold
fmk through pies of pork. There will be hosts of
side shows. All the people with gardens are to
be asked for flowers, and the proceeds of the fete
will be given to hospitals. One of the Faithfull
family—the rich bachelor philanthropist one—
suggested the idea.
Recessional! llie Week of the Horse is one
with the dusty west-winded past. And Society
having worn its four frocks—separately, of course
—on the four Horse Days, and talked about the
same, is now vowing there is nothing “going on.”
Final criticism of the Spring Carnival is that it
was the shabbiest and dullest race-week for years.
The absence of the Governors had probably some-
thing to do with the dullness. There was no one
in the vice-regal box at whom to make rubber necks.
I his should be seen to. Australia pays Governors
to sign things and to lend the light of their presence
to the semi-illegal business of horse-racing. They
should not be allowed to shirk half their work.
The Acting-Ex. Darleys had a lot of violet about
them. To match them Mr. Robertson Clarke
violetized himself—violet tie (a lot of violet tie),
a paler shade of violet waistcoat, and a bunch of
violet flowers in his coat. A girl informed me
that lie had, as well, violet hose, but as I think
that, like the woman in “The Walls of Jericho,”
she was much too well-informed for a girl of her
years, I had better not mention the item.
Therefore I hereby leave it out. Swathed waists
were ten deep everywhere, and so were dust
coats—three-quarter length things, in white silk
principally.
Some tulle boas were abroad—the most perish-
able of things; and the wearers wore, as addi-
tional garments, a strained “ take-care-don’t-
touch-me-l’m-fragile ” expression, and kept their
hands and elbows at angles, like Cleopatra in the
Egyptian pictures. Whilst on boas, Mrs. George
Gaden (who was the Hordern pretty) had an in-
digo blue one, of the usual feathery kind, over
her blue frock. One of the best gowns out was an
Irish crocheted lace inset with panels of white kid.
A She went close to it, put her glasses to her eyes,
and speaking quite loudly to her companion said :
“ Ameliar, this dress cost every shilling of forty
guineas and before even it saw a scissors either.”
A racing man’s wife made a good picture in navy
blue chiffon over white silk. In ornaments the
funniest I saw was that worn by a damsel with
uiallee leaves in her eyebrows. Round her neck,
suspended by a slender gold chain, was a tooth—
unmistakably a human double tooth. In painted
nets, Mrs. Coleman Burke’s outfit took the sunset.
It was very suggestive of crushed roses and a
languid sunset and “a bed of daffodil sky”
as Tennyson has it. A chill westerly made
anaemic-looking the usually good complexions of
the large tribe of visiting Maddens, and of the
Burdekins. Tailor-mades ought to have been out.
but Miss Bonsor’s royal-blue was the only one in
sight.
One of best-admired dresses at Saturday’s race-
meeting was a grey crepe-de-chine with a cream
Valenciennes bodice, the whole groundwork carry-
ing a passion vine-leaf design cut out of grey cloth
and outlined with narrow silver braid. A hat of
silver crinoline kept the artistic get-up in tune.
Wearer was a costumiere in a hig Oxford-street
firm.
Saw a new flower for the first time on Saturday.
It is a Luther Burbank cross between a wisteria
and a sweet-pea. Mrs. Mark Foy had a spray of
it on her tobacco-hued silk attire. Last American
steamer brought it in the freezing chamber. Mrs.
Brough, much rounder in the face than of yore,
and garbed in blue linen, was, with her sister,
Miss Emma Temple, much gurgled over by Miss
Eadith Walker and a large party.
An anecdote. One of a certain gilded N.S.W.
clan was on the lawn emphasing loudly his opinion
of horse Emir. “Emir was a brute—a brute that
shouldn’tbeallowed to race. He had kicked his stall,
or stable, orsomethinghorse-architectural, to pieces;
he had kicked stahle hoys, and had lamed other
horses. He shouldn’t he allowed on the course,”
etc, A phantom, who chewed and expectorated,
turned round and, fixing the squatter with an
ancient mariner eye, drawled—“My good man,
if you were as Well bred as Emir, you could kick
every other human off this blessed lawn.”
Private chronicles from London tell that Miss
Maisie Kelly—sister of W. H. Kelly of this city—
is sharing with Mrs. J, T. Toohey the financial
responsibility of Hetty Adler’s musical education,
Little Adler js the promising vocalist who went
hence with Florence Taylor, the pianiste.
-c urther chronicles mention the success of the
ritzstubbs twins. No “fake” about the authori-
tative opinions on them. The musical Big
trots here, who thought the twins of no artistic
account, candidly acknowledge that they might
have been mistaken. Miss Fitzstubbs and her
' n good financial form. The lady
sold for nearly £3OOO a reversionary interest in
some property.
Auld Scratch must have his address in William-
street, near Forbes-street. He lies in wait there
tor the carriages of Somebodies, like a roaring
lion hidden behind an herb. Last week, after the
smash-up of Mr. and Mrs. Bertie Kelly’s dog-
cart, came other horseastrophes. The Teeces
and a group of Fairfaxes and two Knox
pT whilst driving in to the Australian
Olub ball, were spilt all over the road there-
abouts, but not seriously damaged. Towards
the end of the week Mrs. Lachlan Beaton, with
Miss Ruby Adams and small boy Beaton, were
pitched out of their dog-cart also thereabouts,
with the result that they were beautifully ena-
melled with bruises. And a few hours later
Mrs. Jack Toohey and her sister, Mrs. Arthur
Ha vies, were cannoned on the train lines out of the
former s dog-cart and badly mottled at the same
fatal spot. A male friend, whose interest had
been aroused, went that way one morning at one
o clock to see if the author of the mishaps was
about, and thought he saw his hoofs and tail dis-
appearing round the corner, but he can’t say for
certain.
A lawyer sends me this :
Gent One’s yarn re divorce, in a recent Bulletin, re-
minds me tliat even the youngsters have lax ideas on the
subject of the marriage tie. A legal brother was sitting
in his office one day when in came a little maid, dissolved
in P lc ' ce d her up, soothed her, and discovered
that the cause of the trouble was a grievance against pa and
ma, who had run counter to her wishes. She showed
some reluctance to leave, and eventually confessed that
she had called on him “ to get a divorce” from pa and
ma aforesaid.
Notice in a South Brisbane ballroom: “No
lady shall wear a dress cut lower than from point
t ) point of the shoulder,, the committee to be
judges of the matter.”
Into a race-tram last week swarmed two per-
sons. One was a long, lean female dressed in
gobelin blue and a moss green toque, and afflicted
with a distingui face, like the one which might be
worn by a queen named Jobson. The other was a
short, wide young woman who was having a fight
to a finish with her long white gloves. Said she,
ii\vr Volce t ;l ’i e< l hard for an English accent :
Wouldn’t you think I was Irish ! They say the
French woman puts on her gloves in her dressing-
room, the English woman in her drawing-room, and
the Irish woman in the street.” The jabberwock in
blue drawled in reply, “ I shouldn’t think the Irish
would wear any.” Then the wide damsel, for the
benefit of a breathless public, mentioned “The
Darleys expect me to tea this afternoon.” The
Darleys C.J., wife, and daughter—were at the
races that afternoon. So was General Gordon’s
wife. Now these distinguished persons are Irish,
and they wore gloves that afternoon—a fact which
must have astonished the banshee in gobelin blue.
The tenacity of the sex. A lady holding an
umbrella in one hand and a penny (for the turn-
stile) m the other, missed her footing when step-
ping from the North Shore ferry boat, fell into the
harbor, sank and rose. She was pulled on board
still grasping the penny and umbrella. She ought
to get some society’s medal for saving property.
Civil Ambulance ball, engineered mainly by
Mrs. Hamilton Marshall and Prof. Anderson
Stuart, rolled off most successfully.
debutante at the Euryalus dance was
IJr. Brady s daughter, a bright-looking, dark-
haired damsel in a very becoming tail-less frock.
A private letter from Steffani mentions that
Florence Schmidt—sculptor Wood’s wife—is re-
turning to the public gaze and intends giving a
concert in November. She has begun a course of
resurrection study under Steffani, who finds her
voice in fine form but with a little accumulated
rust. Florence has achieved a gifted husband and
a fine baby, but the platform calls. To have the
entire approval of a baby is good; but to the
average woman it doesn’t quite compensate for the
encore shout of a crowded concert hall.
Mr. Douglas Fry, an English animal painter of
some repute, and a cultured worldling as well, is
much in demand these days among the Pointer
families. He has painted some of the Berry (Dr.
Hay s) herds of choice oxen, also some quadrupeds
belonging to Miss Eadith Walker, and some
more owned by the Woods, of Newcastle.
That little civil court case (but carrying large
possibilities as a precedent) between violinist
Pechotsch and an insurance society reminds that
Mrs. Pechotsch, in whose favor the policy was
taken out, is the mother of young barrister Curtis,
)Trr°v w^ ote the IJrrics 1 J rrics and P art of the book of
Ihe Coquette.” She was a favorite contralto
and married the late Mr. Peter Curtis, a solicitor,
who was considerably her senior.
Max Schliiter—you remember the gifted Max
with the Beethovenish face and hair worn in the
fashion of a duck s tail—sends two slips of lustrous
pasteboard. His name is on one, and on the other
“Baynhild Schliiter Fodt Madsen.” So he has
married. And the bride was “ born ” Madsen.
Cardinal Moran will, it is announced, take an
interest in the musical prospects of a girl singer,
Miss Marion Markey, a Canadian who comes here
from Adelaide.
Talk about the rest-cure ! There must have
been a rage-cure in Queen Elizabeth’s time. The
fiery queen, as played by Miss Nance O’Neil, goes
into two tempests of wrath simultaneously, and
being reprimanded by Burleigh (as much as he
dare reprimand a lady with such red hair) she
tones down and says he’s right. Her physicians
only allow her one rage every 24 hours, and this
is her second. At 70 she is as well-preserved as a
umman of 50—so perhaps there’s wisdom in letting
off steam. It is a Turkish bath for the soul. The
m hvidual who doesn’t boil, but is only glacially
malevolent, probably dies young through a severe
cold settling on the chest of his spirit, and turning
into soul pneumonia.
Miss Nance O’Neil’s sister, Lillie Lamson (Lam-
son is the O’Neil’s real name), who used to play
rustic parts so well on the American stage, has
left the footlight glare in favor of rose-shaded
electric lights in a private drawing-room. In
short, she has married.
Miss Maggie Baxter, late of Sydney, is, from
all accounts, writing and selling short stories at a
furious rate in London. The active damsel was
instrumental, with Dr. McCarthy and others, in
getting up the ’9B monument that towers in
Waverley cemetery.
All the Pointer families are in a simmer of
amusement over an exhibition of thrift by a Rose
Bay family. They let their house furnished, and,
after settling about rent, &c., the incoming tenant
was asked to take over the stores remaining in the
house. After a little hesitation he agreed. The
price-list of “stores” was paralysing. “Two and
a-half candles, 2sd. ; loaf sugar, 3d.; four nut-
megs, 2d.” Sometimes society does not go in for
wasteful and ridiculous excess.
Such a storyette ! An American millionaire
had an unusually intelligent dog, of which he was
very fond. Man’s son greatly desired a gay time
in Paris, and as there was no chance of getting
money directly for the gay time, he, by means of
forged letters, persuaded his father that there
was in Paris a great scientist who could teach the
intelligent dog to talk. With a big bank draft
young man and dog went to Paris, and for over a
year great accounts of the dog’s progress were
forwarded to the millionaire. When the
money was exhausted, the gay boy and
the dog—now a good linguist—started for
home. The proud yet anxious millionaire received
his heir at the wharf—but no dog. When told
that the animal was “no more,” he reeled and
called upon his gods. “Dad,” said the ycung
man, regretfully, “ it happened just out there not
a mile from home. We were both standing on
the deck and he suddenly looked up to me and
asked, ‘By the way, does your father still carry
on with his little typist ?’ and, for mother’s sake,
Dad, I threw him overboard. You see, mother
could have got the whole truth out of him any
time for a chop.”
Miss Beatrice Day has no part in the broad comedy
known as “ Beauty and the Barge.” There isn’t
any beauty in it—it’s mostly bargees and barge
and two girls with squeaky voices. Miss Bessie
Major is a smile-provoking person in the
sad farce, and Emma Temple, as the barmaid,
looks the best of a funereal cortege. On opening
night the Day sat in the circle flanked by her two
married sisters, who live up the North Shore line.
The trio seemed to be well off in the matter of
corn-colored hair. Wish the Broughs would set
the stage masons to work again to rebuild “The
Walls of Jericho.”
Two pleasant sorts of business will come toge-
ther with the marriage, which is announced to
take place next year, of Miss Kate Abel, only
daughter of Mr. 0. B. Abel, of Sydney, the big
confectionery man, to Mr. D. M. B. Simmons,
youngest son of the late Mr. Michael Simmons,
the big tobacco man, of Sydney.
Next Saturday evening will see the wind-up of
the Art Society’s exhibition, and Mr. George
Taylor has taken over the rooms in order to give a
Bohemian evening in aid of the Children’s Hos-
pital. Musical and artistic novelties are an-
nounced, and “a well-known actor has promised
a great surprise.” The promoters promise that it
will be the best Bohemian night yet given in
Sydney.
A son of J udge Rogers was married last week
to Miss Metcalf, a member of an old Sydney
family. Bridegroom is a solicitor practising in
Narandera ; bride, who is well-dowered, is a good-
looking much-liked girl.
Mayoress Allen Taylor’s reception on Thursday
brought a huge race-frocked crowd to the Town
Hall. Reigning Mayoress, by the way, has a very
good name among the various charitable com-
mittees for thoughtful hospitality.
1 ew weeks ago a navy steward on the warship
Wallaroo was convicted of appropriating money
to the extent of £2O. In evidence it was proved that
he had been steward on H.M.S. Mildura for 12
months at a wage of £8 monthly. When trans-
ferred to the Wallaroo his pay was reduced to £3
a month, and on this he had to support a wife and
child. He had had an unblemished record in the
navy, and intended to repay the cash out of a
legacy coming to him from England. Three
pounds a month to keep a wife and child ! It’s
rough on the boy of the Bulldog Breed.
Talking of coal : Prof. David says we have in
Australia coal to the value of twenty-five thou-
sand million pounds. The sum is scarcely realis-
able. We are four millions as to population, and
(only we don’t know it) we are all immensely rich.
Go on the coal, young man and young woman !
Late W. E. Sparke, the rich old Elizabeth Bay
celibate, whose will was proved at close upon
£450,000, left £13,000 to each of the seven
daughters of his brother. To the five daughters
of his sister, Mrs. Friend, he willed large sums
and to Mrs. Friend herself £lO,OOO. A. Carson]
nephew, will get close on a quarter of a million.
A Sydney woman has just told me that she
would know if she were in a vegetarian restaurant,
not by the menu, nor by the name at the door,
nor from any previous information, but just solely
from the fact that the male diners never look
interested in or smile at the waitresses. She says
further that vegetarians are mostly men. Women
don’t affect the diet, and the waitresses at the
grassy restaurants are meat-eaters. Commenting
on the Congress of Vegetarians lately held in
New York, one of the chief speakers—a medical
man—said he had been consulted by a lady as to
what diet would most quickly enable her to get on
“ the astral plane.”

Gerolstein, survives as Marquise de Bionne.
MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, September 18, 1905.
Mr Dear Yarrie,-
The bride of the season (she was a lady secretary)
made her bow to the military circles over which
her reign will chiefly extend at the Australian
Garrison Ball last week. Mrs. Templeton is a
nice young dame, with nothing of the sharp rat-a-
tat manner of the typist, or the secretive air of the
private secretary. She’s just simple and straight-
forward, and has got right out of the way of call-
ing her hubby “ Sir.” After some years of office-
work that mode of address must be hard to drop.
I knew a typist once who frequently addressed
her employer as ‘'Old Boots” instead of “Sir,”
but he was very deaf, and I don’t think she let him
hear her.
Miss Maggie Stirling’s arrival was at first a
matter of pleasant anticipation, then of anxiety,
and finally it developed into a thing of worry.
All on account of the Mayoral invitations to a
welcome, with a note that the rout
off the day after the songster’s arrival. This set
the invited tearing round the city to make
inquiries as to what line she was journeying by,
and when that boat would lower the gangway.
For three days knots of the Bidden gathered
vaguely at the Town Hall, and were told that
there “wasn’t any reception to-day, mum,” and
wandered to tea-rooms forlorn and unreceived.
A touring pastor, journeying hither by the same
uncertain Aberdeen, was also the cause of much
anxious thought on the part of his parish enter-
taining committees. Twice were fresh buns
ordered and the tea things spread in vain, until
the bun of welcome deferred made the parish
heart sick.
Miss Stirling was hurried into a series of fussy
welcomes as soon as the Aberdeen landed her.
The Mayoral one happened at noon on Saturday,
and the returned songster (who, please remember,
hadn’t to be benefited to the Smoke) got
breathless laughing and talking and nodding
thanks to all the gush. She shows an increase of
avoirdupois for all her careful corseting, and
only a remote resemblance these- days to the
Lady Linlithgow. Her capacity for much gurgle-
some laughter has increased, and her frocking is a
matter of much money. Mayoress Pleasance and
the aldermen’s wives gave the Cliveden Dowager
first deal, and saw that Janet was ready to fold
the warbler in her discreet affections.
The musical brethren, under the hosting of
some of the numerous brothers Tait, welcomed the
same returned warbler to the Pianola Hall on
Saturday evening. An elaborately trained gown
of pastel blue glace and a joyful head-garland of
foliage, was the Stirling outfit. Beside her
sat the Dowager, in magpie colors and a delicate
helping of purple. One diamond crescent lodged
on the tip of her coal-black thatch.
The Cliveden Dowager has the two braw Stirling
children under her wing. One of the twain is a
large girleen reaching towards her tuneful mom-
mer’s length and weight. T’other is a boy (large
size) and both are jolly-looking.
“ There’s a wild motor story in circulation
anent a chappie who potters in politics about here.
It seems his motor machine ran over, or ran
down, or was run down by a quiet old milk cow in
a country road. The motorist didn’t pause to see
the pieces, but whizzed on his way. In some way
or other (whether he turned up in town carrying
traces of spilt cow about him, or with his machine
splashed, doesn’t transpire) he was found out,
and one day a cart was pulled up
at his fashionable club bearing masses
of dead cow that had suffered a good deal
from keeping. The motor man within was sent
for, and, the story goes, he refused to appear.
For the whole of that day the cart, with its
dreadful burden, tracked the chappie round till a
settlement was effected.
It has been rumored in Adelaide that several
very well-dressed persons have “ withdrawn their
support” from the Government House Garden
Party, to be held in aid of various Adelaide hos-
pitals, because “several of the nurses voted for
the Labor party.”
A small, hairy, excitable musician was present
at the Scandinavian masked ball when the photo-
grapher’s flashlight apparatus blew up, filling the
room with dust and consternation. The small but
hefty music-maker was seen pawing round in the
fumes, calling wildly on his wife. Then he seized
a lady in abbreviated skirts, hoisted her in his
arms, and staggered into the street, bearing his
kicking, squealing, and expostulating burden into
the middle of the road, where a crowd instantly
collected. There the hero inspected his prize for
the first time, and discovered that instead of his
wife he had rescued a strange woman. On behold-
ing his error he uttered impassioned cries in a
foreign tongue, smote himself thrice on the fore-
head, and dashed back into the Town Hall again,
leaving the disgusted shepherdess under public
inspection in the middle of the road.
Now and then the Waxcellency and his Missus
let Melbourne gaze on stately middle-age in a
state of beautiful curl and oil and preservation.
They minuetted to the Scandinavian Ball, the other
night, but had departed, with stately mien and
slow, before the flashlight explosion. Fortunately !
It would never have done for his back hair to have
been sizzled off in sight of a reverential gathering,
or his dignity blown off without warning.
The Harold Kents are having a good time in
the Cold Country, so their friends say. Ascot
has opened the languishing Mrs. Kent’s eyes to a
race spectacle and the real heavy-weight manner
of doing things when Royalty is present. At
time of last writing the pair proposed running
across to the Green Isle to see how a horse-show
goes in dear, dirty Dublin. He, I suppose, is
still carrying the fair one’s cloak and brolly—the
white man’s burden when wives play the masterful
beauty till late in life.

It is generally thought that there is no
cure for stoutness, because the usual treatments
only confine themselves to combating single
symptoms instead of attacking the root of the
disease. Pyrolene Pellets remove not only the
superfluous fat, but also the internal deposits of
fat which hinder the action of the heart and lungs.
We advise a trial. Pyrolene Pellets improve the
breathing, give the heart freedom, enable the

which not only puts sliine on them, but soft-

other massive stucco buildings in this tall neigh-
borhood have changed hands recently, but the
“For Sale” or “ To Let” signs still flaunt over
many other mansions.
Mrs. Fred Payne is the first in the field with a
booking for Cup-week. She has hit on Nov. 3
in the hope that the Challenger crew will add
their brass furnishings to the ballroom view.
This dame did a good deal of entertaining on her
recent trip to the Harbor City races.
The Misses Winter have left by the India, on a
leisurely tour of Europe.
Mr. Charles Campbell, the wealthiest wool-king
this side of the Murray, and one of the most
generous supporters of the Scots’ Church, died
last Wednesday. He had just finished a liberal
round of hospitality when his illness set in.
Miss Amy Ricardo, only chick of the Military
Commandant of this State, was married last week,
the lucky groom being Mr. Robert Beggs, a
squatter, of the Western District. The audience
was of but 50 souls all told ; but it was real smart.
The bride has pretty eyes behind her pince-nez,
and a knack of wearing her dresses gracefully.
The abrupt cancelling of the Nurses’ Dance hurt
the feelings of all the ticket-selling Nightingales.
Most of them had worked for the revel, and had
prepared fine raiment and had put oil in their
lamps. Its sudden cancelling by a committee is
ascribed to the influence of the recent Children’s
Hospital affair.
Federal members on Friday were interested in
Miss Florence Lloyd and Miss Maud Chetwynd,
who flitted from one House to the other with a
distracting air. Miss Lloyd on the boards is a
better boy than girl, but off she answers the
docorative purposes of womanly woman very well.
By the way, she-mummers seem to take an odd
delight in sitting out the play in the political cir-
cus. Perhaps they pick up wrinkles.
One Toorak dame has her Pomeranian to table
with her, and all the protestations of a reproachful
spouse are of no avail. He relates how tenderly
and with what effusive attention the yelper is
treated, while he sits waiting for the gravy or a
second helping of new potatoes. A husband who
is treated like that should insist on the lady going
to her Pomeranian when the monthly dress cheque
is due.
The diminutive wife of the Federal Fysh—the
Fysh who, according to his own accounts, swam
in such muddy waters when he was in office-
entertained at the Grand last Thursday. The
small Tasmanienne is determined to show that
herislandisnot entirely represented by thesportive
Senator Dobson, and that official sprees are not
peculiar to the Forrests. The affair was marked
by no end of jollity. Dame Fysh believes in the
ball being kept rolling. She calls a gander a
gander (which it probably is), and keeps a laugh
going all the while.
An Adelaide correspondent writes to me :
Fashionable female Adelaide is, as I write, sitting-
shivering at street corners, and occasionally rattling a
Children’s Hospital collecting-box to call attention to its
blue nose and frost-bitten fingers. Last year the hospital
collecting day happened 'midst clouds of dust; this year
it occurred amid rain, slush, and misery. A big sum was
raised last year, and, as the promoters always select
Agricultural Show-day, when the town is filled with
whiskered people from Wayback, doubtless the Children’s
Hospital will benefit a great deal again. It is fashionable
just now to give the threepenny-bit with the hole in it,
and the dubious sixpence, and the trousers button, to
this deserving institution. The hospital stands alongside
St. Peter’s Cathedral, where Society gets saved in a
fashionable manner, and is reproached moderately for its
sins, and is told that it is Lost with limitations. Not
many years ago the block where the hospital and cathedral
stand was known as the “ Devil’s Acre,” on account of
the character of its inhabitants, who never went to church
and never put anything in the plate, because they r wanted
the 3d. to buy beer with.
The disposition of the fair sex to garb and un-
garb in the strong light that beats upon a window
is responsible for a good deal of glee and shock
among those dwelling in opposite buildings. In
Collins-street, where all the flats and residential
or professional quarters are, some distressful scenes
are occasionally witnessed. Saw. t’other day,
across the street, a huge, elderly matron, in trans-
parent muslin, struggling into a straight-fronted
mould, cast originally for some modern Milo
several sizes smaller in the figure. The blows,
puffs, strains, drags and gathers to get her bulk
into the area were painful, and it was a long time
before the ironmongery was adjusted.
A bun struggle and free talk in connection with
the Victorian Waif and Stray Society (in charge
of sturdy Miss Sutherland) came to an abrupt'
finish the other night, owing to the hall'being
engaged for another show before the first was done.
Alfred Deakin had his turn before the switch-off,
otherwise he might have charmed the officials and
the time-keepers into a hypnotic trance of forget-
fulness. But those who had not done their turns
felt rather hurt at their abrupt conge. In the
bosom of every public man there is always gather-
ing a few remarks, and if he can’t discharge them
he suffers seriously from their suppression.
General Finn turns up at few festivals; he’s not
that sort of soldier. The other night, just by the
way, I suppose, of proving that he wasn’t bigoted-
but could be gay as well as busy, he appeared at
the Australian Garrison Ball. So far the Vic-
torian forces sum the chief up tersely as a white
man, which indicates that he is giving himself no
great preponderance of airs. Mrs. General Finn
has not yet tarried any time in Melbourne. A
small family prevents a devoted mother from
bothering overmuch about frocks and frills.
Prof. Sugden has spread his deck-chair aboard
the Himalaya, which weighs anchor this Tuesday.
The prof, leaves two posts to fill—the Queen’s
College mastership and the billet of Argus musi-
cal critic. There will now be a rest from the Sug-
den gush that spent itself so freely on the con-
servatorium in Albert-street, where the prof, once
drew a bow across the ’cello under Hall.
The lengthy Governor of this State is still saun-
tering through asylums and hospitals, and
focussing his pince-nez on butter exhibitions,
varying his sentiments to suit the differing occa-
sions. It will be awkward if one day the Tail-
bottle declares his gratification at seeing this
splendid proof of the natural resources of the
country as he looks upon a hospital for incurables,
and announces his sympathy at a show of prize
pickles. Since he only uses the two sets of
opinions, it’s quite possible he’ll fall into the
wrong one, one of these occasions.
All the canaries of the Marshall Hall collection
twittered over the vocal recital of Mr. Hal Cohen
last Thursday. The singer has a large, soft pre-
sence, and a cherubic set of expressions, which
play havoc with the Conservatorium Miss. Indeed
that young person has very nearly wrecked the
Cohen chances of a platform career,.by suggesting
inducements of a matrimonial character. Mr.
Hal just saved himself, and really does lots of
Rood work with a vocal organ of fine range and
roundness. Interspersed with his German songs
was a French chansonette by Miss Carmen Pin-
schof, the dashing daughter of the Austrian
Consul —a little amorous fragment tunefully ex-
pressed. ■ •- - - ■■
One firm of “ Royal infant powders ” vendors
advertises its wares with a picture of a woman—
presumably the Queen of England—taking two
walking children and an infant in arms out for an
airing in Windsor Castle grounds, wearing her
crown the while. This is a touch of nature. In
hot weather, of course, she doesn’t wear her crown,
but drags it behind at the end of a string.
You bang a handful of roses, or lilac, or mixed
flowerets, on the crown of a hat or on the brink of
one, tip the shape over your eye, and there you
are, millinered in the height of fashion.
Mrs. Edward Miller has condescended to hold
a show of needlework at Toorak House on Thurs-
day (21st). It’s an invitation affair, and the paste-
boards intimate “At Home ” in festive type.
What’s to happen is not obvious. Probably the
specimens of stitchery are to be admired and dealt
for in bazaar fashion, Mrs. Miller helping things
along with a two-inch smile and tea and toast.
The Silver Star polish on the prize shirt plots at
that Laundry Show in the Exhibition wasn’t a
circumstance to the brilliancy of the Waxcellency’s
top bump and verbal frill as he opened proceed-
ings with a soap-sud speech. Standing in the
foreground of a starched plank, with the Silver
Star mounting in the rear, and overlooking a huge
area of shirt and sun-bonnet, the Waxcellency
struck the multitude as a little Moses delivering a
sermon from a mount. The Monday clothes-boil-
ing became, in the pink glow of the Madden
eloquence, a thing of joy and glory.
Pictures of beautiful, buxom maidens at
the tub flashed, iridescent as the bubbles from
the wash, before the audience, and a contemptuous
allusion to John of the pigtail and the flatiron
caused every heart beating beneath linen to regis-
ter a resolve to have the heathen launder no
longer. Afterwards the Waxcellency descended
with a beatific smile, and headed a pilgrimage
with the Starch _ King (Robert Harper) to the
shrine of the shirts, the crowd following, still
dazed with his silver eloquence on the subject of
the People’s Wash.
The two dames of most importance at the wash
show were apparelled in committee black. Dame
Madden relieved it with a sprig of violet. Mrs.
Harper used her tallest glasses on her lord’s
expensive scheme of advertising, and was able to
tell to t’other matrons the points of the heating
and blueing apparatus. She did it in a calm man-
ner that betrayed no vulgar enthusiasm over the
source of the family’s wealth. The crowd swarmed
mostly round the laundry partitions, where teams
of ironing Suzettes “cushed their duddies to
the work,” and raised a Star polish that made the
eyes blink. Young domesticated couples formed
the bulk of Saturday’s gapers—the women looking
a trifle shame-faced at being brought along by the
shirted sex to see how ironing perfection was
accomplished. One or two lithe young females
had gained a few points in the stage business from
the “ Madame Sans Gene ” play, and won a fire
of admiring comment.
The girls of Musgrove’s chorus ranks made Mrs.
Maesmore Morris an affecting presentation before
the co. left Melbourne. The gift was a heart-shaped
toilet set. After her recent ordeal, the heart-
shaped powder puff must have been a pretty solace
to the grieving lady.
Miss Margaret Thomas is an example to all
petite femininity of howto snuggle with the greatest
ease and most effect. This city has never seen a
starlet nestle with more naive fetchingness than
the small Thomas. If her eyes were not so per-
fectly young and innocent, and her prattle so
tenderly green to the ear, this suspicious public
would put the Welsh cherub down as Erenchy—
which means all that the British girl isn’t and
would like to be.
A brown son of the soil, down for the Show of
Ayrshires and Harvesters, had his affections
tangled in the soft locks of a tea-room server. He
had only a fortnight for his visit, so pres-
sure of time led him to a hustle with his
love affair. Before he knew exactly what
he was saying, he found himself being gently
questioned as to his station property. “I m
ready,” he said—urged by the thought of the
return trip in the morning and the soft eyes afore-
said—“ to settle 70,000 sheep on you for a wedding-
gift if you marry me. ” He was shy and awkward,
but his heart was in the right place. He put
down the moment’s silence of the dear young
charmer to diffidence and the depth of her feeling
for him, and was just going to try and coax the
pet when she remarked simply, “And suppose
there’s a drought! ” He didn’t stop to suppose
any. A disillusioned young man resumed an erect
attitude and turned away.
Yours, TRYPHENA.
‘R.H.K.”: Patrick Brougham (men-
tioned in Bulletin, 7/8/'O5) was not the owner of
Hartwood Station at the time of his death. He
had sold out many years before.
Victoria has had a new Thunderbolt as a
result of the publication of Monckton and Pratt’s
narrative of the only original. At Toora, James
O’Donoghue conceived the quaint idea that he
was the famous ’ranger, and having the dregs of a
month’s drunk in him, he took his little gun and
started to clean out two towns, Toora and Welsh-
pool. He rampaged for two days, during which
time he prodded up a railway station, two stores,
and a bank with his rifle, smashed some property,
and held the main street of Toora in subjection.
Then he was strapped in a straight jacket by the
local police, and put away to cool. Meanwhile
the Argus continues its pleasant tale, and quite a
flock of Thunderbolts may be looked for.
Of late a considerable crop of accidents has
happened to the apparatus for perpetrating flash-
light photographs, and an expensive law suit has
already started on its career by reason of an
episode which suggested that the photo, man had
tried to take a flashlight group with a jug of dyna-
mite. In this law suit the traders in photographic
materials rushed over each other in their haste to
disclaim all responsibility. And as it seems, from
their account, that any crowd which wants its
flash-light photo, taken is liable to be blown up
legitimately, and without hope of redress, it looks
as if the suburban assembly will have to give up
the hope of having a reproduction of its hop in
Melbourne Paunch or Sydney Mail. The pro-
cess begins to look too hazardous.
“A Canadian,” who has been some years
in Australia, writes to Sydney D.T. :
Australians don’t know when they are well off. They
have an endless summer in this land, and a land of free-
dom. You grumble at the land and income tax here, but
what would you do in Canada, where everyone over the
age of 21 has to pay a tax, and where you are beset with
compulsory road labor and school tax, whether you are
single or married, to say nothing about the trying climate
in winter? Our cold, wet weather in Australia is as a
sunshiny day to the mildest winter ever witnessed there.
I would like to see some person write about the disadvan-
tages of that country; we hear enough about its advan-
tages. I, for one, was glad, when my holiday was over,
to return to Australia again, for after living in a beautiful
climate and a free country like this, it would have been
utter madness to entertain the thought of staying at
home. And my advice to all Australians, young and old,
is to stay at home, and make your country the better for
your presence, and not run a wild goose chase by going to
Canada. Be satisfied if you have only half a loaf here ;
you might find yourself without even the crust there.
A plaint from Melbourne
Melbourne, when all its alleged improvements have
been perpetrated, will be known as “ the city of old
stones.” Johnny Clayton, or E. G. Fitzgibbon, or Tommy
Bent, or whoever is committing the’ gardening freaks
that are gradually punctuating Melbourne, has appar-
ently been left a plot of land with a big moraine on it, or
else the Customs have seized a consigmfient of condemned
rocks. At every corner and square and vacant spot
in the city a lot of worm-eaten-, leprous-looking
boulders are being dumped, and big, unsightly
heaps of dirt—alleged flower-beds—piled up. Shrubs and
plants are to be set in these some time in the sweet bye-
and-bye. So far all that can be seen is the rocks, the
dirt, and the water squirts to squirt the plants that
aren’t there. No one would mind this mania for ruins if
it were only worked off on vacant lots. But the man who
has the stones to get rid of has set to work on most of the
tree plantations, chopped them down, carted them
away, and put up his heap of dust and his cairn
of ancient rocks in their places. One of the
decentest things about Melbourne was the pre-
sence all over the east of the city of plantations of
well-grown firs and pines, with an occasional oak and
Moreton Bay fig. Many of these have gone, and a whole
crowd more have been marked for the axe. It doesn’t
seem to be anyone’s business to stop the chopping down.
The “great dailies ” publish letters starting “I wish to
call attention to a flagrant act of vandalism,” etc., but no
one wakes up. When all the trees are gone there’ll be a
fearful rumpus and an inquiry board, and some office boy
will get the sack.
The defence of Australia depends upon the
common sense of Australia. Awhile ago, perhaps,
it anyone had ventured the statement that the
wisdom of Australia is laigely a matter of well
ordered invasions of D.O.L. whisky sceptics might
lave sneered. The temperance sceptic sneers even
now: -But to-day the proposition that D.C.L. is
the best policy for the Commonwealth is as readily
adopted and as freely absorbed as the liquor itself. *
Maoriland s champion drinky court orator
is John Burke O’Brien, an aged derelict, who can
describe the interior decorations of almost every
gaol and police-station in the State, and whose
eloquence would melt an iceberg. He told a Wei-
ington magistrate lately that he was thoroughly
ashamed of himself, and implored that official to
send him down to the destructor to get cremated.
He promised, on his honor, if not cremated, never
to offend again. The court let him go, and John
ijurke 08. sallied out and got paralytic drunk
again, and was given seven days.

And swept before him, flying past,
And sullen storm-clouds roll;
Though coughs and colds are in his wake,
Yet still I feel secure,
And fear him not, because I take
Some Woods’ Great Peppermint Cuee.

POLITICAL
POINTS
There is talk of closing the Federal session
in October —barely two months hence. Deakin
will have to find a way of shortening the N.S.W.
Foreign-traders’ tongues to accomplish that.
Oppositionist Prendergast, when debating
the Dairy Bill in Yic. Assembly the other night,
got off something like a bull. “ The fee is only a
shilling per cow,” said a member. “Ah, yes,”
replied Prendy, sadly, “but that may mean a
great deal to a poor woman with a few hundred
cows. ”
The Queensland Ministry has decided that
any future imported State Governor will have to
Eay his A.D.C. himself if he wants to hang that
yphenated person on to his retinue. Queensland
is trying now to crawl from under the load of the
Biggest Debt per Head on Earth, and it can’t
afford aides-de-camp.
No matter what brand of Ministry may be
in power, the Australian Senate is either adjourn-
ing, or has just concluded an adjournment, or else
is arguing as to what it can do to fill in time. It
surely should be possible to arrange the Govern-
ment business so as to give the Senate a chance to
work early in the session.
Significant, in connection with the Foreign-
traders’ uproar about the increase of duty-value of
harvesters, from £3B 10s. to £59 25., that for the
last five years Westralia has, under its special
tariff, valued these machines for duty at £7O, and
is still so valuing them. The importer has made
no atom of moan about that action ! Why ?
Premier Rason of Westralia starts busi-
ness-on a large scale. He says (1). that he pro-
poses to borrow another million ; (2) that he isn’t
going to retrench; (3) that he isn’t going to
impose any new taxes this year ; (4) that he sees
ahead a deficit of £323,000 ; (5) that he is going to
trust in the magnificent natural resources of the
country.
“Trains for sale.—Ffty-four locomotives
and 368 coaches,” is an English newspaper advt.
Electric traction is the other part of the story.
But Australian fool financiers who have sunk great
loans in locomotives and coaches won’t provide
for a sinking fund, and drift to disaster on the
assumption that all the loans are sunk in permanent
works which neither age, nor scientific progress,
nor anything else can ever knock out.
DOWN IN GIPPSLAND.
Go on the land, young man! Go on the land!
You may not get much money, and you may have
to work hard, but if you subscribe to the Arcus
(post paid), and can get it delivered, you will be
able to read every day that you are the salt of
the earth.
Justice O’Connor, of the High Court:
“The fact is, that there are circumstances in
which, for their own good, it is not right to allow
people to make contracts about work and wages
as they please.'’ This is an obvious truism ; and,
if it weren’t, a Scottish Court decided to similar
effect many years ago, when certain workmen
signed contracts to toil for stipulated—and appar-
ently fair —wages for a term of 20 years.
The borough of Windsor (N.S.W.), the
historic municipality where ancient Hayseeds
scoop a lazy living out of the soil, recently adver-
tised fora cheap arrangement to fill the five posi-
tions of council clerk, rate collector, inspector of
water supply, inspector of nuisances, and inspector
of dairies (the two last functions presumably over-
lapping a good deal in the dirty old Oxbury town-
ship)—all for the princely salary of £9O per annum.
Maoriland Tories, like other Tories, say
that State enterprises are always failures. They
have said this with great violence about the two
State coal mines, but their wickets were badly up-
set by Minister for Mines McGowan on Sept. 7.
He submitted figures showing a clear profit of
£ll,OOO on the first year’s transactions —where-
upon the Ananiases said there had been “ un-
warrantable interference with private enter-
prise ! ”
During the policy debate in S. A. Assembly,
Territory member Solomon angrily rubbed it into
Moulden, President of the National Ass., for that
animal’s action on the franchise question at elec-
tion time. “He is no leader of mine,” snorted
Sudden Solomon, savagely. Whereupon a voice
arose : “You are not the first of your race to deny
his Master.” But the point would have been put
more neatly if the interjectorhad just said “ Cock-
a-doodle-doo ! ” three times.
It has been resolved by the Tasmanian
Assembly that future elections are to be conducted
on the Hare system, or the hairy system, or some
such “truck.” Tasmania’s finances may be rotten,
its population may be decreasing because it allows
a few'huge monopolists to block settlement, and
its public debt may be the most awful sample of
waste and thriftlessness on this earth, but at all
events it is solid on getting the hairy system of
voting at general elections.
Justice Heal in Queensland has ruled that
a warrant under the Fugitive Offenders Act for
execution in the Transvaal should have beensigned
not by the State Governor, but by the Governor-
General of the Commonwealth. If that is good
law it is a handy tip for W. N. Willis, the warrant
for whose arrest in S’Africa was, it is understood,
endorsed by the State Governor. And it almost
certainly-is good law. No one outside Australia
is supposed to have official knowledge of any
Governor except the Governor of Australia. The
State Governor is only a kind of enlarged mayor.
Amendments to the Trade Marks Bill
moved by Attorney-General Isaacs propose a
“Commonwealth Trade Mark.” This may be
applied to all goods manufactured in Australia
under conditions of labor which the Australian
Parliament by resolution declares fair and reason-
able, or under conditions governed by any State
or Commonwealth Arbitration laws or Minimum-
Wage laws. The Minister is to register a design
as the Commonwealth Trade Mark, and to see
that it is not misused or infringed. This is a
sound, practical step in the direction of popularis-
ing Australian-made goods and combating sweat-
ing.
For years past Senator Guthrie has been
urging the seamen’s unions of Australia to estab-
lisli a central executive, and for years
the short-sighted unions have refused
to strengthen their own hands. The
seaman is more governed by legisla-
tion than any other class of worker.
He is controlled by law from the
commencement of his engagement to
its termination, and therefore any
advancement must be through poli-
ical action. The existing unions are
all local and autonomous, and con-
certed action on any given point is,
therefore, difficult. The ship-owners
have more sense, and maintain an
executive in Melbourne, with a paid
secretary and a large staff _of clerks.
This employers’ organisation keeps
itself in touch with shipping affairs
all over Australasia. Unless the
unions follow suit and set up a similar
executive, giving it full powers to
act for all the seamen of Australia,
they can’t expect to do much good.
British Trades Union Congress
has declared against Protection. Also
it has declared against Chinese labor,
not having the sense to recognise
that, from a Labor point of view,
there is no difference whether Chinese
labor works for you in China, in
S’Africa, or in England. The Free-
trade Labor man should be an en-
thusiastic supporter of Chinese labor.
The same congress crowned its record
with a vote against industrial arbi-
tration. The British working-man is
still very little of a reformer. The
majority of him does not want social
regeneration; merely yearns to be
left in humble enjoyment of his posi-
tion as an employed person, and to
touch his forelock to his betters, and
to have a cheap plug hat to wear to
church on Sundays.
T. P. O’Connor asks if the next
British House of Lords will talk with a
Yankee accent.
S.M. Herald pats Reformer Carruthers
approvingly on the upper part of the back because
he intends to pledge the country to Uncle Cohen
at a less rate in 1906 than in 1905. Carruthers
admits that he intends to borrow rather more
next year than he did last year, but it appears
that he expects more babies to be born this twelve-
month than last, and dividing his increased loan
money expenditure among the expected increase
of babies, he produces the result which the S.M.
Herald so strongly approves of. Supposing
Carruthers to be blessed with twins in the coming
year, and a recourse to the local pawnbroker to
be unfortunately necessary, would the Herald
congratulate him on the reduction in his interest
bill per head ?
WHEN THE FIRE
BREAKS OUT.
N.S.W. Premier Carruthers will not do away with the
old three-storey oil-soaked mill used as a home for desti-
tute old men at Parramatta, but he promises to equip the
place with fire escapes I —News Item.
The Australian Government has been try-
ing for three years to settle up with the States for
the properties—post offices, telegraphs, customs
houses, &c.—taken over, and has been severely
spoken to by many eminent State Frights for not
having the job finished. It is still trying, but as
late as last week it hadn’t even managed to per-
suade some of the slovenly State Governments to
appoint an official to negotiate with'the Common-
wealth authorities about the price to be paid.
Opposition leader Prendergast moves a
simple amendment to the Vic. Poisons Bill that
aims at abolishing the opium traffic. Opium
vendors must be registered chemists only and
must be annually licensed for opium sale. No
sale must be made except following the written
prescription of a legally qualified doctor, and
vendor, purchaser, and a reputable witness must
sign the chemist’s poisons book for each sale.
Penalty up to £5OO fine or 12 months’ gaol.
The “made in Australia” campaign is
having some result. In Melbourne bootmakers’
windows one now sees goods labelled “ best
Australian make,” the word “ Australian” being
obviously pasted over "English ” or “American.”
Of course most of the boots sold in these places
were Australian all along, but they formerly
masqueraded as imports in order to please some
foolish persons who imagined that nothing good
could be made in their own country, thereby
judging other Australian products by themselves.
Yic. M.’sL.A. Colechin and Elmslie are
inviting the attention of their fellow legislators to
an amended version of Isaac Isaacs’ lost Usury
Bill. The new Bill fixes 10 per cent, as the maxi-
mum rate of interest, gives police magistrates
power to fix rates, and to order the return of
moneys paid at a higher rate, and limits the in-
terest in insolvency proceedings. Also it provides
that where a pawnbroker realises on a time-
expired pledge more than is due to him, the
balance, in default of the pledger claiming it, shall
pass into the State Treasury.
For a week or two N.S.W. Assembly was
almost threatened with dignity and intelligence,
and it refused one or two of the applications for
select committees to inquire into the reason why
Smith’s fence blew down and why Johnson’s dog
barked at night. Now it has relapsed, and a third
committee has been appointed to inquire for the
third time into the suspension of Robert Roberts,
“late bookbinder in the Registrar-General’s
Department ” ; also the little ha’penny woe about
George Hardacre’s conditional purchase, and
sucli-like obscure trash, are again in full bloom.
The N.S.W. North Coast railway, on
which it is proposed to spend £2,700,000, is a line
which certainly should be built—out of revenue.
The North Coast is the richest and best-watered
part of the State, and it has been left an almost
inaccessible and untenanted wilderness while easy
lines have been built out on to the flat western
dust to lure the small settler to his ruin. Joseph
Carruthers, in the days when he was a sham
reformer, talked of building the North Coast rail-
way out of land revenue, but that reforming
Joseph is quite dead now. The work is to be
charged to loans, and the lands it opens up are to
be sold and the proceeds spent to cover current
ex.’s in the old villainous way.
The public, con-
stantly reading in she
papers of “The Sugar
Bonus,” has grown to
think that the sugar
industry receives from
the Commonwealth
Government a gift otit
of Federal revenue.
Such, however, is far
from being the case.
The fact is that the
industry has to carry
an excise duty of £1
per ton on sugar grown
by white labor, and £3
per ton on sugar pro-
duced by black labor.
So far from the sugar
industry being encour-
aged with a gift or
bonus, it is the only
industry, except alco-
hol and tobacco manu-
facture, which is com-
pelled to pay an excise
duty for the benefit of
the Federal Treasury, j
When the Arbi-
tration Court sat re-
cently at Dunedin
(Maoriland) the card-
board boxmalcers’ log
(woman workers) was
discussed. The girls
wanted 4s. 6d. per
gross for making
“ cigarette boxes with
shoulders.” This was
3d. rise. An employer
slated that imported
boxes had formerly
cost ss. lid. per
gross, duty in-
cluded, but just
lately Japanese
travellers were
offering them at
2s. lid. That
was why he ob-
jected to paying
4s. 6d. Th o
Court seemed
astonished, but
when one comes
to consider under what
conditions the Monkey works, what alleged
wage he gets, and all the rest of it, there is no-
thing to be surprised at. It is plainly up to the
Seddon Government to knock the Monkey out by
higher Protection.
By way of combining two great Australian
industries, sheep and borrowing, why not call it
1.0. Ewe?
The latest about the Federal capital is that
Prime Minister Deakin has at last found a way of
referring the questions at issue to the High Court
which satisfies even the cranky Carruthers, who
first demanded that the matter should be referred
to the High Court, and then asked Heakm to tind
the method. Deakin’s “ satisfactory ” communi-
cation has therefore been referred to JN.b.VV.
Attorney General Wade, who so far seems to have
done nothing, and Carruthers has also so far done
nothing, and things are again hung up waiting tor
Carruthers.
General Redvers Buller on the British
army:—
Instead of looking after and encouraging and improving
what they had, our statesmen have disorganised the
army, discouraged the militia, and disheartened t
volunteers; and, as Lord Roberts told them the other
day, they have produced a state of affairs which is worse
from a defence point of view than we were in before the
war. .
And Australia models its defence system on this
low-spirited force which is divided into three
sections —the disorganised, the discouraged, ancl
the disheartened.
The specially sore spots in the N.S.W.
Budget are, according to Sydney D.T., the old
age pensions and the public instruction expense.
Both these accounts show increases the o.a.p.
amount for 19J6 being set down at £522,21b and
education at £919,2GC. The first the D.l.
sheds tears over, and as to the other it asks Is 1
necessary there should be all these additional
teachers ? ” Strictly, neither is necessary; the
superfluous old man might be asphyxiated, and it
children were not taught to read they at least
would be spared the D.T.
Last year was a very great year for
N.S.W. in an agricultural sense, yet according to
Premier Carruthers the whole value of the Stafe s
agricultural output was only £5,414,000. And to
earn this miserable sum it was necessary to prop
up the industry with indirect subsidies in the
way of railway rebates to the extent of much more
than £l,ooo,ooo—to carry the farmer’s produce
below cost to that extent. Also, the farmer had
to be exempted from all laws and regulations
regarding wages and hours of labor, and allowed
to sweat his employees without restriction, and he
also had to be exempted from payment of local
rates. Meanwhile the manufacturer, who pays
local rates, who is charged exorbitant railway
freights to make up for the farmer’s subsidy, and
who pays far better wages than the farmer for
much shorter hours, was worth over £II,OOO,UUU
to the State. Yet the Joe Cook gang has the
effrontery to speak of the manufacturer as it he
were an incubus, and to describe the agricultural
person as the backbone of the country.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
A. J.C. Spring meeting, which closed last Satur-
day, was organised largely for the support and encourage-
ment of the Maoriland breeders and owners. G. G. Stead,
with eight wins, mopped up £3570 ; H. E. Good took
£2222 through Maniopoto’s remarkable reversal of form in
the Metrop., and W. Lyons and D. J. Price took £396 and
£268 respectively. This represented a total of £6456 won
by Maoriland horses out of £14,766 prize money available.
All Stead’s horses did well, but for consistent
running Isolt’s record would be hard to beat. In the
Spring Maiden Stakes (1J mile), with 7st. 41b. up at 5 to 4
“ on,” she won in 2min. 9£sec. In the Wycombe Stakes
(1 mile 3 furlongs) she carried 7st. 91b. and won in 2min.
20|sec. That time her price was 6to 4 “on.” The Mem-
bers’ Handicap found her weight increased to 9st. 51b. and
the bookmakers shouting 2to 1 “ on.” She covered the
9 furlongs in lmin. 55sec.
* * * *
In previous years the “ form ” of the horses that
made the best appearances at Randwick may have been
misleading, in some cases, as a guide to backers at Caul-
field and Flemington a few weeks later. But it was at
least an interesting matter for logical discussion and
reasonable inference. This year the four days’ results of
the A.J.C. Spring meeting have merely proved that
Maoriland was first, and Australia nowhere. Of all
the probable competitors for the Cups, the only
one with “class” to recommend it is Maniopoto. The
speediest of the others have very little stamina, seem-
ingly. They are a flimsy lot, and when a jostling handicap
race is fought out by a crowd of commoners something
unexpected is pretty sure to happen. Ikey Mo. has the
prospect of a rich harvest. Betting on the Cups will take
a wider range than us.ial as soon as the market recovers
from its attack of paralysis. Where the best (bar Manio-
poto) are known to be second-raters who shall say what
horses are too bad to have a chance at the weights ?
* * * *
Maniopoto’s last season’s record : At Manawatu
R.C. April meeting, carrying 9st. 131 b., he won the
Welter Hack mile in lmin. 43sec. Same day saw him
carry Bst. 131 b. over six furlongs in the Electric Handicap
in lmin. 15 4-ssec. Next day, with 7st. 13. b. up, he
won the seven furlongs Borough Handicap in lmin. 28see.
Next he appeared at the Hawkes Bay (M.L.) May meeting
and won the Cup (limile) with Bst. 21b. up, in 2min.
9 l-ssec. Then he appeared on the training track at
Randvvick and broke watches from standing starts and
did other weird things, and, humping Bst. 41b., ran some-
where about eighth in the Epsom mile, which was won in
lmin. 39sec. With 4lb. less in the saddle on the following
Monday he covered the Metropolitan 1J miles in 2min.
32£sec. Following Wednesday, in the Craven Plate,
carrying 9st. 41b., he finished a dozen lengths behind the
third. The time for the Craven Plate was 2min. 7sec.
A wonderful beast, truly, but in spite of his in-and-out
running one worth watching for the Melbourne Cup, in
which he carries only Bst.

What a number of hard-headed punters have
been prophesying for some time has happened with regard
to Emir. There were some who tipped that the piggish
Victorian crack would some day stop dead right in the
middle of a race. In the Randvvick Plate (2J miles) the
brute obstinately refused to race worth a cent in the last
mile. Maorilander Nightfall streaked away and finished
20 lengths to the good of Marvel Loch, with Emir third.
Backers laid 7 to 4 freely on Emir, while 5 to 2 was offered
against Nightfall. In the same event 12 months ago Emir
■was a hot favorite, but finished third on that occasion
also, beaten by Martian and Lord Cardigan rs named.
Nightfall’s time, which would probably have been better
had the mare been pressed, was only Jsec. slower than the
Australian record (3min. 57Jsec.) created by Lord Ullin’s
Daughter in last Australian Cup.

Turfdom is at present arguing as to whether
G. G. Stead is uncommonly lucky or an exceptionally
good judge. Multiform, sire of the four horses he raced
at A. J.C. Spring meet, was, after shaping in Maoriland,
sold to an English buyer. Later on the Canterbury
sportsman bought him back. Against his judgment, it .s
urged that he announced Noetuiform and Sun God were
not in the same class as Charles Stuart and others, and
that last Spring he disparaged Martian, Grand Rapids
and Nightfall. But writer has an idea that those remarks
were due to G.G.S.’s native modesty, 1h; : e;:ret of his
success is that he invariably races to win, and has a
trainer who understands his business thorcughly.
* * * *
The relative form of Emir and Gladsome seems
clear enough. The mare is the absolutely best in Aus-
tralia over the 11 mile—her favorite course—but the
Ballarat horse can be expected to beat her over 12 fur-
longs. Their w.f.a. performances, as a rule, have proved
the correctness of their running in last Caulfield Cup,
where Emir finished third, with Gladsome a couple of
lengths behind him.

Every time the tote question has been raised in
the Vic. or N.S.W. Parliaments, two or three alleged
authorities on racing matters have solemnly assured Mr.
Speaker that the machine is a bad thing for the turf
in Dick Seddon’s country. Indirectly it was suggested
that Ikey Mo. was necessary to those owners who tend to
improve the breed of ract horses. The breed would de-
teriorate, it was hinted, if the tote were permitted in the
principal racing States of the Commonwealth. Now we
have the nags from the “ deteriorated ” turf running rings
.round the champions of the bookmaker-governed world.
Apropos the Maoriland scoop at Rand wick,
Monday week. Victorian nags nearly did the same thing
at Adelaide birthday meeting, when Hasty, Devon,
Figaro, and Foxtail won races, and Blythe only
missed the steeple at the last jump.

The racehorge Valiant, which has been wandering
around as an exhibit in various Australian law courts
since January, ’O4, has at last got back to the paddock of
his original possessor, John Connors, of Tarrawingee.
Valiant, it is said, was taken from his owner’s paddock
about Jan. 4th, ’O4, and placed in the pound at Reid’s
Flat (N.S.W.). Patrick Joseph Mullaly bought him for
£5 Is. from the poundkeeper, and raced him. The
Law has now decided that Valiant belongs to Con-
nors, who gets his horse back. But, in case the animal
should feel lonely, it returns with a bill for £450 law costs
to keep it company. It will need to be a good horse to
carry that tail. : r
Victorian bookmaker, horse-owner and bruise-
promoter Jack Wren is about to sprawl over Sydney, ana,
with a view to making a great splash, has secured exten-
sive premises near King-street for a “club. ’ The club
is an institution which is looked at askance by law’norder,
and Chief Secretary Hogue says that Attorney-General
Wade will rise to the. occasion shortly and wipe out the
clubs with a stroke of the pen. Hogue evidently has a
large opinion of Wade, but that lengthy lawyer will have
to improve vastly on his Willis form to deal with Wren.
The big Dunlop road race from Goulburn to
Sydney was a wild rush before a gale and a half, of 10
Maorilanders and 77 Cornstalks, for the blue ribbon of the
State. Of the 103 acceptors, 16, including Vic. and Tas.
reps., withdrew at the last moment. The Maoriland contin-
gent was a strong one, and numbered 13, but three dropped
.out. The Islanders figured largely among the back markers,
and the only scratch men were the mighty brothers
R. and J. Arnst. The weather was good, and the only
disadvantages were the dust and patches of loose metal.
.Smashes were amazingly numerous, and the race demon-
M. ROBINSON, winner of Dunlop Goulburn-
Sydney Road Race.
strated that the wooden rim is a failure for rough-riding—
so great a failure, in fact, that its use in road-races will
be prohibited by the League. The men from Maoriland
were not nearly as successful as the horses from the same
State, and with the exception of the prize for the fastest
time the loot was scooped up by the local riders.
The fastest time was made, of course, by Maori-
lander J. Arnst, who hurled his vast length over
the 131 J miles in 6hr. 38min. SOsec., or at
a rate of nearly 20 miles an hour. This
damaged his own 1904 record of 7hr. 6min. for the same
trip, beyond repair. The winner was the Cooma rider,
Mark Robinson, who had 55min. start, and did the jour-
ney in 6hr. 44min. 39sec. H. L. Orr, one of the limit
men, finished second in 6hr. 59min. ; and P. S. Hagney, of
the Wahringa Club, who made a mighty effort to do the
fastest time, and was only just beaten by J. Arnst, was
third.
* * * *
Mark Robinson, the winner, is a young man on
whom there are neither frills nor flies. He was quite
apathetic about his win, and did not seem at all enthusi-
astic over his exploit. This writer is quite unable to
think of anything that would excite that stolid young
man. Ha’s of medium height, well-developed about the
chest an.l shoulders, with a sunburnt skin and dark red
cheeks. “ I’d heard all about the road from my younger
brother who, you remember, won last year’s race. Yes,
there are seven of us—six ride bikes, and four of us were
running in this race. I tell you there was no fun in it ;
just a steady, hard grind to overtake the chaps in front,
and a harder grind to keep in front when they were
passed. We caught the leaders two miles Sydney side
of Moss Vale, and Hogan, Woods, Orr, Dean and myself
kept together right down to Picton. I dropped the last
of them on Razorback, and when I got on the Sydney
side had a fall. The hardest part of the journey was
from the dropping of the other fellows into Ashfield on
my dead own. I got my head down and went for my
life, expecting to hear big Jack Arnst go whizzing past
me. Clouds of dust, and both eyes watching for the
loose metal underneath. The wind helped us all, you „
know, and accounted for the fast time we made. In fact,
it helped us along so that we were through before
the people expected us, and I saw hardly anyone on
the road. I don’t think I’d have gone in for the race but
for Henderson, o 1 the Carbine cycle works in Park-street,
(Sydney). I was in with my brother, and he said I ought
to have a cut at it. I’d been riding an old jigger for
months and was hard as nails, but hadn’t got a machine
fit for that trip, and I was going back that night. ‘ Come
inside,’ savs Henderson, ‘ and I’ll make you a blooming
machine while you wait ! ’ I went in and he measured
me, and within two minutes of three hours I was testing
that newly-built machine in Park-street. I guess that’s
a record ! About the race ! Oh, yes. Well, when I got
to Ashfield I was fairly baked, and the first thing I did
was make for a nice drink of cool water, and then they
piloted me off for a hot bath and all the rest of it. No,
there’s no fun in it. I didn’t see anything along the road
worth speaking of; perhaps it was because I kept my
eyes glued on the track.”
At Auckland (M.L.) the Australian Fifteen
found itself opposed by the identical team which had
defeated Wellington for the Ranfurly Shield. Auck-
land won the toss and started with the wind
behind, but the Australians played an aggressive
game in spite of the breeze, and held the Kauri
men in their own territory. At last, by a great effort, the
Aucklanders broke through and by converting gained a
lead of five points. Immediately afterwards the Aus-
tralians got across the line, and by some bungling failed to
score, and what should have been a try was turned into a
force. Owing to this the first half ended in favor of Auck-
land. In the second spell the wind favored the Australians,
and they began to attack. Then Judd was ordered off the
field for rough play, and according to all precedent Aus-
tralia, with one man short, was as good as beaten. But
precedent was disregarded. Australia charged again, and
from the midst of a mass of struggling Aucklanders
Russjll “ potted ” a goal beautifully. Then the local men
came with a rush ; but the Australians stopped them,
took the leather from them, and driving them back over
their own line, scored. Another charge of the forwards
took the ball into Auckland territory and the backs got
over the line, but the shot at goal again failed. Australia
was now leading by five. The local men had little time
left, but they played for all they were worth, and a
penalty kick brought their score up to eight. After that
the game raged up and down without further happenings,
and ended in a victory for the Australians by 10 to eight.
The tour comprised eight matches, of which an equal
number were lost and won. On points Maoriland leads,
having scored 91 to our men’s 63.
*
As anticipated. South Sydney Rugbyites downed
Balmain last Saturday, and thereby ended the compe-
tition by carrying off the premiership for 1905. The
club’s record is 31 competition points. Of the 18 matches
played it won 13, lost two and drew one. The other four
points represent the two byes drawn through the presence
of the odd team in the competition. By points scored as
well as matches won, the club beat all competitors, having
scored 212 points during the season. Glebe finished a
good second, being only one competition point behind.
In points scored, however, the discrepancy was very much
in favor of the sandpluggers ; South Sydney leading by
27. Newtown got third place with 24 competition points,
and Western Suburbs was fourth with 22 points.
' Balmain, which finished third last with 14 com-
petition points, flew high in the latter days of the compe-
tition, and strove desperately to alter the destination
of the championship. On Saturday week the narrow
margin by which South Sydney defeated the men
from the peninsula indicated that the paladins had
gone off, and that there was some clay in the feet
of the idol of the barrackers. On the other hand,
Balmain was improving every week. It raked in some
dark horses from outside, and crumpled up the University
in great style, so it seemed just possible that it might tie
with, if not defeat, the leaders, and send them to battle
with Glebe for the premiership. But on Saturday all
these possibilities came to an end. South had trained
hard through the week, and had the better organisation
to work on. Balmain put up a splendid struggle, and
played a vigorous attacking game in the first half, and a
sound defensive one in the second. It was half an hour
before the struggling South Sydneyites managed to break
away from a throw-in and score, and the first spell ended
with the champions three to nil. In the second spell, with
the wind behind, South Sydney captain followed Napoleon’s
tactics at Waterloo, and sent charge after charge against
the Balmain line. The defence was beautiful, and only
twice did the Souths get through. Then they failed to
convert the tries into goals, and the game ended in favor
of South by nine to nil.
* * * *
The struggle of the leading Sydney “soccer”
clubs for the Gardiner Shield draws to a close, Rozelle
having beaten Pyrmont in the second semi-final on Satur-
day by two goals to one. Next Saturday Balmain \yill
battle with Pyrmont for actual possession of the drinking
implement.
In Victorian League football Saturday’s semi-
finals bumped up against the old trouble known as the
“ right of challenge.” Collingwood was playing Carlton,
and Fitzroy Essendon, but the position was that if ’Roy—
the second highest club —won its semi-final and a final it
still boasted but 14J wins this season whereas ’Wood had
already scored 15, whereby ’Wood has the right to
challenge ’Roy or any other team that may win the
pseudo-final. It was glorious weather, and some 15,000
people paid £482 to see the game, but when the play, at
half-time, had resulted in Carlton notching five goals five
behinds to ’Wood’s three behinds, nine-tenths of the
spectators ceased applauding, and devoted themselves to
sarcastic remarks about “ Collingwood’s price,” “Wren’s
divvy,” etc. It was a fair game to watch —Carlton putting
in strenuous work—but ever there obtruded the idea that
’Wood was merely trying in spots, and scarce spots at
that. Carlton finally won by 11 goals 10 behinds to
’Wood’s four goals six behinds, which wasn’t anything like
proper form. Fitzroy downed Essendon just as suddenly
—by 12 goals seven behinds to four goals 12 behinds—but
here the best team undoubtedly won. Essendon’s defeat
ensured its disappearance from the list there and then.
At both grounds admission price was raised from 6d. to
Is. “outside”, whereat much grumbling; and, in truth,
neither game was worth that for which the Association
charged a mere fid.—the semi-final, North v. Williams-
town, where the all-conquering North had all its work
cut out to keep atop of ’Town, finally managing to do so
by five goals five behinds to three goals eight behinds.
For this match the Association laid on the hitherto-
eschewed boundary umpires, and these, with the rule
against kicking in the ruck, made the game faster and
more open.

Two striking failures among the picked
Englishmen who met the Australians in several matches
were Haigh as a bowler and Hirst as a batsman. Haigh
is nearly at the head of the season’s averages for bowling
in all matches, and Hirst stands high as a batsman, but
this successful pair of county mates made a disap-
pointing show in Test cricket, where the captain, Jackson,
distinguished himself all the time. Hirst certainly put
up a good enough bowling performance for Thornton’s
Eleven. ,

Armstrong carried off first honors in the tour of
the Australians in England, securing the first place in the
batting average in 11-a-side matches, and second in bowl-
ing ; as a bowler he missed first place by OO'Ol of a run per
wicket. Also he was first in both departments in all
matches. His batting average in both instances are
records for visiting Australians, and so is his 303 not out.
He also achieved the distinction of taking over 100 wickets
and scoring (in all matches) over 2000 runs. The nearest
to Armstrong’s big score was Murdoch’s 286, and that was
23 long years ago, before the banks burst.
Results of the three last cricket tours in first-
class matches show:—
Played. Won. Lost. Drawn.
1899 .. 35 16 3 16
1902 ..39 23 2 14
1905 .. 35 15 3 17
§o that the 1905 figures are the worst of the three. In
test matches the ’99 team won one game and drew four.
The ’O2 crowd won two, lost one, and drew two. The ’O5
lost two, and drew (with luck) three. Seeing that the
1905 crowd included nine of the 1899 team, and 10 of the
1902 lot the result is not to be wondered at.
* * * *
Twenty-two centuries were made in the recent
tour by the Australian XI., and twelve against them.
The Englishmen scored six of their centuries in Test
matches, against Duff’s solitary 146 in the fifth Test. Of
the Australian twenty-two centuries Noble made six, and
Armstrong and Hill four each. The 1899 team, with
twenty-five three-figure scores, still' holds the record,
while Trumper’s eleven centuries and over in 1902 is
easily first as an individual performance. Trumper’s
deeds in that season will not be beaten until a new
record-breaker arises, fpr'though Armstrong’s figures this
year nominally work outsat a better average, his batting
cannot compare with V-ictor’s performance three years
ago- ' i'' * *
S.A. cricket is likely to lose Norman Claxton
during the coming season. He is a land agent, and has
opened a branch establishment at Port Lincoln, and the
extension of business promises a curtailment of pleasure.

now throws up a penny in his back-yard every evening to
decide whether or not he'-’will go into the arena again.

The Vic. amateur Billiard championship is being
contested this year (at Alcock’s Billiard Hall, in Elizabeth-
street, Melbourne) on the American tournament plan.
The whole of the eight entrants are drawn in pairs for at
least two rounds, but a player is counted out when he has
lost two games. The play in the first round—soo points—
indicated an ultimate victory for Jacoby, who won the
championship last year after a good battle with O. M.
Cock, the one Victorian amateur whose style has any-
thing’ of the best professional polish. But Cock, seem-
ingly, is disheartened by the uncertainty of his play
(which is apt to slump from time to time in the course of
a long game), and his name is missing from the present
tournament. In his absence, Jacoby is unquestionably
the best of the eight men. Aleck Campbell, who went
down before him in the first round, is about the most
reliable of the others. The final game—if a “ final ” comes
to pass—is to be 1000 points, played in two instalments of
500 each, afternoon and evening. Had this division of
labor been made last year Jacoby would have had a poor
show to outstay C. M. Cock. t
Kieran still improves, and, according to the
cable, which does romance a little occasionally, covered
the half-mile at Belfast in llmin. 2 l-ssec.—92-ssec. better
than his own previous world’s best at Farmer’s baths,
Sydney, March last. This was the record which the
British resolutely refused to believe or recognise, and now
it has been broken under their own blessed management
it is up to Fogland to apologise for doubting this conti-
nent’s word. This is the second of his own world’s records
that he has reduced for the haughty Briton’s benefit. At
Redcliffe, Saturday, he got over 300 yd. in 3mm. 32sec.—-
just l-ssec. slower than his world’s record of Feb. 25th
this year. „
Vic. 10-mile cross country championship drew
a considerable crowd of man, and a host of girls, to
Caulfield racecourse last Saturday. Champion Geo. Blake
(Melb. Harriers) got home 300 yd. ahead of the second man
—Bult, of East Melb. Harriers. The winner's time
(57min. 59sec.) was a “ fair knocker ” to the knowing
ones, beating veteran C. E. Herbert’s record time (59min.
ssec.) by lmin. 6see. Bult also got within previous best;
his time (58min. 51sec.) could have won any back number
of this race. Comparing Blake’s performance with the
English race last year over same distance, one course
being no easier than the ether, it looks as though Blake
will shake up the best of them in the Cold Country. Had
Shrubb started in Saturday’s race, the finish would pro-
bably have been a close thing between him and Blake.
Of 14 teams contesting the club championship, East Melb.
Harriers won from Melb. Harriers by some few points.

It was only after it was all over, and he had to
be taken to Sydney Hospital to have his head dressed, that
ex-champion bruiser McCall realised how much damage
he had got at the hands of Timothy Murphy. His upper
lip was cut right through, and had to be stitched. That
much-battered ear was in a terrible state, and had to be
fairly sewn into shape again, and there were other contu-
sions and injuries innumerable. Nevertheless he is
anxious to fight Murphy again within the next six weeks
for any portion of £2OO that Tim likes to risk on the ven-
ture. So far, Tim, like Baal, maintains a dignified silence.

At Mick Nathan’s hall, Melb., on the 11th
inst., a mere handful of patrons witnessed enough fight
to have satisfied a £5OO house, when P. M’Mahon, a clever
Westralian feather, and J. Perkins, a local slogger, met
and worried through 20 hard, eventful rounds, it was a
blood-stained mill, but the stains were all on Perkins,
who was merely a target or beacon for M‘Mahon most of
the time, though he rushed in a solid thump now and
again, and had a show for a chance victory right up to
the last gasp. M'Mahon hit often, but he couldn’t hit
hard. Perkins hit hard, but seldom, and he usually hit
the place recently left vacant by the agile M‘Mahon.
When M‘Mahon 'did not shift with quite sufficient
alacrity, he stopped something that deranged his plans
for a minute or so, and made him anxious to hang on and
smother up. M'Mahon was declared winner on points.
A long, trying struggle for about 9d.

“ Snell ” : The Kernick-Squires tight was some-
thing in the nature of a bitter disappointment, and the
Napoleonic Wren got much more newspaper appreciation
than he deserved for his management of the big event. It
may have been good biz. to stall off into the back blocks
of the Exhibition Building thousands of people who had
paid ss. each, while in front of them stretched a waste of
empty chairs, but the ss. mob couldn’t see it in that
light. Evidently a very large 10s. and £1 crowd was ex-
pected, and the fight occurred in the absence of this vast
and enthusiastic section, but the half-crown and crown
patrons were as the sands of the sea for multitude, and
after considerably discounting announced results, it is
probably true that there was £lOOO or £llOO in the build-
ing. All this for less than two pen’orth of fight. The
footballing novices didn’t count, and were a lot of un-
handy slovens at the game, with perhaps three excep-
tions, and Kernick went into the ring whipped. Squires,
who is no scientist, punched him pretty well anyhow', and
won his money without once smelling trouble, although
it was thought he’d accepted a real visitation when he
skidded on the half inch of pow'dered resin with which
some foolish person had strewn the whole ring. The
crow’d, one-third of which could see little out of the dim
distance and the smoke of a thousand cutties, while
another third was practically blinded t>y the large elec-
tric lamp swung right in the line of vision, left without
making a single complaint. They had been gulled ovir
Kernick’s abilities and pluck, but they did not murmur,
although the punch that was said to have outed the con-
quered must have been landed in a close hug, if it landed
at all.

Sydney Gaiety Club saw another rousing fight
on Saturday night, when Messrs. Quigley and W llks
bashed one another till, in the 13th round, the people
disrespectfully spoken of as “ the Johns” stopped further
slaughter. Previous to the disturbance a number of
reckless-looking individuals exclaimed in loud voices that
they would lay 6 to 4 against Mr. Wilks. Nobody took
any notice. When the gentlemen entered the ring a
storm of voices arose begging someone to take up the
offers and make money. Nobody passed a cent. The
scrap started gently, but by the second round the
baresark fury of both sets of ancestors was raging inside
the ropes. Both attacked, having simultaneously thrown
all notions of defence overboard, and they turned
an alleged glove contest into a wild-cat, raw-meat
exhibition of the crudest character. Half - way
through, things seemed to be going Mr. Wilks’
way, and the odds were being offered on him in
voices of passionate entreaty. Nobody took any notice
of the odds. In the 10th round Wilks was down —can-
noned off the ropes, as it were. But he got up and sur-
vived a hurricane of swipes and bashes. In the 11th
Quigley was dancing round him, trying to get in a final
stroke, but couldn’t. The start of the 13th found Wilks
driving Quigley all over the available space. Then Quig-
ley lashed out wildly with his left, and Wilks’ head shot
back and he staggered. Before he could recover Mr.
Quigley lashed out again, and Wilks flopped heavily.
He staggered up, tried to flee round the ring, was
knocked half-way across it, and was prone when the bell
went. Then Law’n’order said it must stop, and the referee
announced Quigley the winner.

violently with the Rowing Association last year, and
sulked in its shed rather than take part in the Eight-oar

October. As the strongest club on the river, it could not
afford to long continue the policy of the mule, and the
peace-making has been done with as little publicity as
possible.

“Hexham”: The N.S.W. Agent-General is to
inform British agricultural laborers who wish to
come out here what are the wages in Australia in
their line. But who will inform the Agent-
General? We don’t know ourselves. Four years
ago I was maize-gathering on the Macleav for 12s. a
week and tucker, which was there considered
good harvest pay. For young fellows as plough-
men 9s. and 10s. a week and keep is the rule on
the rivers. In the Cumberland orchards 10s. is
just now a regular thing for men used to the work,
and boys are to be got for as little as 2s. 6d.
Tucker doesn’t cost more than 6s. a week on the
average, so that 10s. and board are only equal to
16s. or at most 175., or 2s. lOd. a day, and not an
eight hours day either. In the North of England
and the Scotch Lowlands, according to official
reports of last year, weekly earnings of agricultural
laborers, including allowances of all kinds, run from
£1 to 225, or 4s. higher than the Australian figures
quoted. Further south wages fall to as low as
14s. 6d. in Oxfordshire, but the average of the
country is quite up to 17s. In all seriousness the
agricultural laborer in many parts of Australia is
worse paid than in England, and he is probably
worse paid on the average. It isn’t wonderful
that it should be so. The landlord is spreading
here, the same as in England. The soil is poorer,
and more acres must be turned over for the same
output. And instead of there being a market for
all the produce in the country, much of the
farmers’ stuff has to pay freight, insurance and
middlemen’s swindles half round the world.
Things might be better if we had a large manu-
facturing population here to buy the produce, but
we haven’t. If Coghlan tells the bald truth to
the English farm-laborer, Hodge will mostly go
home to his cottage and liis bit of bacon with a
resolve to stay where he is.
Hugh Mahon, M.H.R., of Westralia, con-
tributed at least one interesting remark to the
immigration controversy :
I would not object to suitable immigants if there was a
sufficient guarantee that they would settle on the land
actually provided. It would never do to bring people out
here who might afterwards percolate through to the gold-
fields and interfere with the labor market.
Truly it would never do. While Australiainsistson
importing some £30,000,000 worth annually of goods
that it could easily manufacture itself, and lets its
own people lean against a fence, the labor market
is necessarily in a delicate condition, and to throw
even two people on it recklessly might do great
damage.
In strenuously wrestling with the defenec
problem, S.M. Herald takes occasion to say
(9/8/’O5) that for supervisory work that needs a
bit of thinking out, a staff of I mperial officers is
absolutely essential to Australia’s safety, although
possibly “our local staff will answer all routine
purposes.” Judging by the accounts which
Roberts and Buffer give of the British army, and
judging by its South African record of monu
mental blunders, this seems doubtful; however,
that matter may pass. But accepting the
Herald’s theory, it seems equally reasonable to
assume that for information about all large matters
requiring brains and intelligence we should always
read an English paper, though the S.M. Herald
will possibly answer well enough for local and
routine matters—reports re the lining of drunks
and the like. If this country can’t grow a good
soldier, it is just as probable that it can’t grow a
good daily newspaper.
Little Dr. Maloney has duly expressed his
gratitude to his constituents at Melbourne Bene-
volent Asylum. The board of management lately
advertised its thanks to numerous benefactors
of the aged boarders, and among the donations
gratefully acknowledged was a box of “Parlia-
mentary Debates,” from Dr. Maloney. A vener-
able “benevolent,” reading the debates aloud to a
spell-bound circle of asylum politicians, would be
a good subject for a painting.

Lincoln Stuart and Co., Ltd., Melb
Plain English.
A Successful Business.
The business of Lincoln Stuart and Co. was
established in 1884, when Mr. Frank Stuart
joined Mr. T. W. Lincoln on the death of Mr.
MTvor, of the firm of MTvor and Lincoln,
Wholesale Clothing Manufacturers, of 109 Flin-
ders-lane. Mr. Stuart was quick to see the
opportunity for supplying the public direct with
Clothing to measure of high-class character at
moderate prices, so a large portion of the Flinders-
lane premises were devoted to this purpose, and,
by judicious advertising of the fact, very large
business was soon secured. The potentialities of
the business were so apparent that, in 1888, it was
decided to abandon making Ready-made Clothing
for the wholesale warehouses of I linders-lane,
and devote all energies to supplying the men and
boys of Australia with all they required to wear,
in retail quantities at wholesale prices, ihe
business was then transferred to Flinders-street,
and its efforts have been heartily appreciated by
the public ever since: it is to-day the largest of
any in Austrahisia devoted solely to the supply of
mens’ and boys’ wearing apparel. The workrooms
are large, well ventilated, well lighted ; the benefit
and utility of electricity both for power and light
is everywhere apparent, seven electric motors
being used; and everything possible is done for
the health and comfort of the hundreds of em-
ployees dependent on this great industry, and
who in turn are customers for the products of the
farmer and the grazier.
The Why of I*.
Having large premises, equipped with the most
modern "machinery, we can turn out orders in
high-class style at less cost than other firms. We
employ a staff of ten experienced cutters, able to
cut any sort of garment perfectly, and specially
trained in the art of cutting from what are known
(for want of a more convenient term) as Self-
Measure Forms. We confidently assert that we
can sell high-class clothing to measure-value for
value—at lower prices than any other firm in
Australasia. We can do this because we buy very
cheaply from all the manufacturers whose goods
we need—no wholesale house can buy cheaper—
and as we are a wholesale firm selling retail, we
can sell at low prices and still make reasonable
profits. We only want a reasonable profit,
because we want our customers to be our friends
and come to us again and again, and we can’t
expect this if we over-charge them for the goods
they buy. We give them good value by manufac-
turing the greater portion of the goods we sell,
which enables us to be certain that what we do
sell are genuine goods, honestly made and sure to
give satisfaction ; by purchasing the goods which
we cannot ourselves manufacture directly from
the great manufacturers of the world at bed-rock
prices. We believe that by selling perfectly-
fitting, well-made, honest clothing at moderate
prices we can secure and hold the best trade. We
sell no rubbish : we keep all qualities of goods,
but our lowest class is sound and good.
Cheapness and Quality.
Anything to be cheap means that it is the lowest
possible price that any standard article or staple
can be bought for ; but in considering this ques-
tion we maintain that the presence or lack of
quality must be considered also. If a suit is pur-
chased for thirty-five shilling's, or even less, and
in six months’ time is so shabby, out of shape, and
with all the linings gone that it must be dis-
carded, it is not nearly so cheap as one purchased
for fifty shillings that will wear well and keep its
shape for a year. The fabrics from which our
suits are made are of a quality that will wear, and
they are made so as to keep their shape and our
good name.
We believe that when a man wants a suit of
clothes, he does not want the very lowest-priced
thing that can be made, but that he wants a reli-
able fabric, cut in the prevailing style, and
thoroughly well made ; we only make to order the
better grade of clothing, and wish you to bear this
in mind, and remember that we will not send you
Ready-made Clothing when you send us your
order for Clothing made to measure. This is a
practice when measurements are normal, so
where prices are below ours for seemingly similar
goods, there is a possibility of your order being
filled out of stock, You take no risk of this sort
if you trade with us, as under no circumstances
are salesmen allowed to deceive customers in the
slightest degree.

Guarantees.
We guarantee all fabrics to give good wear;
that all workmanship and materials, such as linings,
trimmings, &c., shall be in keeping with the fabric
selected, and that the garments will give satis-
faction in every way. We guarantee all garments
made to order to fit, whether the measurements
are taken by us in our Tailoring department, or
whether you yourself send in your measurements ;
if any alterations should be necessary, we will
make them Free of Charge, and pay carriage
charges both ways. When we send an order to
our Tailoring department your measurements are
copied on a cutter’s ticket, a special pattern is cut
for you, and your measurements and pattern are
kept on file in that department. If the first suit
we make for you is not exactly right, and you wish
changes made, tell us what they are and we change
them on your pattern ; therefore, if we once get
your measurements correct, you need never send
them again unless you have changed physically.
The measure form is simple, the instructions only
require to be carefully carried out, and the fit will
be most satisfactory.
The Philosophy of Dress.
There is the greatest art in wearing clothes.
Don’t you often see men in the street or at church
wearing their clothes as if they were the first new
suit they had ever worn, and inviting public atten-
tion to the fact? Other men may be perfectly
dressed, yet they appear perfectly unconscious of
the fact —that is the way ; clothes should be worn
neatly and in order, but with a certain amount of
ease and negligence; never appear conscious of
your clothes, and you will always be well-dressed,
provided that the garments are well cut, and made
of suitable material. It is of the utmost import-
ance to be well and suitably dressed if you wish
to succeed in life. The philosopher Bacon said :
“ To be fitly clothed is to be largely armed against
unhappiness,” and he was right; a man wearing
well-cut garments suitable to his occupation always
impresses his fellow men and gains their respect,
while the man who dresses in badly-made and
slovenly-looking clothes will be looked upon as a
failure, and generally is.
"We Clothe Everyone
Everywhere.
We have such facilities at our disposal that we
are able to fill the clothing wants of any and every
individual or body of men. The manufacture of
uniforms of all kinds is one of our specialties, and
the making of high-class clothing is our everyday
work. Clothing to measure, clothing ready for
wear, hats of all kinds, shirts for all occasions,
collars, ties, underwear, boots and shoes for men
and women, umbrellas, waterproof coats, oilskin
coats, motor coats of leather and cloth, motor caps,
travelling requisites in bags, trunks, rugs, &c.,
&c., are here in great variety and choice. In all
these lines we have goods of Australian manufac-
ture, and we have such confidence in their merit
that we recommend them to the public of Aus-
tralia. Prices are moderate in every case, and
quality throughout is the best that money can
produce. We would like everyone to have our
catalogue, “The Philosophy of Dress,” which is
sent post free on request, as it will prove of in-
terest, and help in buying. Write for patterns of
our tweeds, serges, vicunas, &c., &c. Suits to
measure, 425., 505., and upwards, stylishly cut,
well trimmed, and thoroughly made.
Buying by Post.
It is easy to order from us. A dip of ink, a
minute spent in -writing, and a postage stamp will
bring our book, “ The Philosophy of Dress” and
patterns of anything you require. Through the
Post Office our Warehouse is at everybody’s door
and everybody’s service ; we make it as easy for
you to purchase goods as though you came to our
counters, and we take all the chances. One of our
books in the house will save you many pounds, for
you will have the advantage of city prices in your
own home.
You take no risk whatever in sending to us for
goods, for we guarantee they will reach you safely
and that they will suit you ; if not you can have
your money back without a word and we pay
carriage both ways ; all you need to do is to tell
us what you require, and send ns enough money to
pay for the goods; we do the rest.
Railway freight is paid on all purchases of £2
and upwards to any Railway Station in Victoria,
or to Railway Border town on Interstate parcels.

EvcrrigM" Serge Suits
A New Blue Serge that will take
the tailoring trade by storm and open
the eyes of men who are economical as
well as dressy.
Made to our order by special process
and improved machinery in one of
Yorkshire’s most famous Woollen
Mills, and shipped straight to
Murdoch’s, in Park-street, “ Where the
Good Hats are. ’ ’
It will defy the fiercest rays of Old
Sol to fade it. It will wear till you’re
tired of it, and till you’re glad to pass
it over to charity.
To Order,
Not in. the last half century lias
there been such a marked improvement
effected in Blue Serges. The man
under whose process this new fabric
was evolved gave fifteen of the best
years of his life to bring it to perfec-
tion. It cost him just that fifteen
years and many hundreds of pounds to
do it. Now it is here, the finest, most
perfect, best looking, and longest
wearing Blue Serge in the world.
“EVERRIGHT” Serges

The Murdoch Method of Making' * s*
S* “E-verright” Suits to Order at 455.
Bound to be Right, because EVERRIGHT.
By our method every garment is produced separately and individually. The cloth is cut to a certain measure. Each
piece, as well as the inside materials behind the cloth, is moulded, shaped, and put together with the single purpose of fitting the
man who ordered the garments, and when Completed there is but one man in Australia that they will fit perfectly. We have
established the first and only complete organisation for producing garments tailored to individual measure at about the same price
you pay for ready-made clothing.

Much That Every Woman Desires to
Know About Sanative, Antiseptic
Cleansing and the Care of the Skin,
Scalp, Hair, and Hands.
WHAT CUTIGURA
DOES FOR WOMEN
Too much stress cannot be placed on
the great value of Cuticura Soap, Cuti-
cura Ointment, and Cuticura Pills in the
antiseptic cleansing of the mucous sur-
faces, and of the blood and circulating
fluids, thus affording pure, sweet, and
economical local and constitutional treat-
ment for weakening ulcerations, inflam-
mations, itchings, irritations, relaxations,
displacements, pains, and irregularities
peculiar to females. Hence the Cuticura
remedies have a wonderful influence in
restoring health, strength, and beauty to
weary women, who have been prematurely
aged and invalided by these distressing
ailments, as well as such sympathetic
afflictions as ansemia, chlorosis, hysteria,
and nervousness.
Women from the very first have fully
appreciated the purity and sweetness, the
power to afford immediate relief, the
certainty of speedy and permanent cure,
the absolute safety and great economy
which have made Cuticura the standard
humour remedy of the civilized world.
TORTURING HUMOUR
Cured by Cuticura, Relief from
the First Application.
“I suffered five years with a terrible
itching eczema, my body and face being
covered with sores. Never in my life did
I experience such awful suffering, and I
longed for death, which I felt was near.
I had tried doctors and medicines without
success, but my mother insisted that I
try Cuticura. I felt better after the first
application of Cuticura Ointment, and
was soon entirely well. —Mrs. A. Etson,
Bellevue, Mich.”
Cuticura Soap, Ointment, and Pills are sold throughout the
world. Depots: London, 27 Charterhouse Sq.; Paris, 5 Rue de
la Pair; Australia, R. Towns & Co., Sydney. Potter Drug &

THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER. —All
who have lost will-power, either by con-
tinually committing themselves to habits of
dissipation or by neglecting the opportuni-
ties to amend, become unfitted for any of the
walks of life. Now 20,000 men and women
have overcome their feelings of reserve to
such an extent that they have openly
endorsed the methods of
and
Weary Women
Will you allow yourselves to
remain in a miserable state
of Nervousness or Debility,
when a Cure is at hand ?
The Physician=in-Chief of Institute,
DR. RICHARD WALLACE.
The FREEMAN & WALLACE
ELECTRO-MEDICAL INSTITUTE.
They restore sufferers to a perfect, healthy state. This is not the confession of merely one person, but Of
TWICE TEN THOUSAND HEN TALKING TO YOU.
These have been Restored to Health by the world-renowned Specialists, and if they are willing to
sacrifice all reserve to prove to you that this is so, you should take enough heed of the matter to
make careful investigation.
The Freeman and Wallace Electro-Medical Treatmant
brings back VIM, VIGOR, and ENERGY to men and women who have wasted their strength and
energies. Those who have wrecked their health MUST certainly suffer. Remember that, and be warned
in time.
DR. WALLACE, M.D., L.R.C.P., E., L.M., has Nine Diplomas and Certificates of Qualification and
Registration open for inspection at the Consulting Rooms. His medical staff comprises FOUR DULY-
REGISTERED, FULLY-QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS, as well as Experts in the special ailments of
MEN. Registered chemists dispense his prescriptions.
You have suffered long and seriously. Why not let us assist you in the realisation of rapid relief and
complete cure ? THIS WE CAN DO WITHOUT DOUBT if you will confide in us. Read the following
description or Keynote Symptoms, and if you have any of them you may rest assured you require the
remarkable treatment that has won name and fame for the Freeman and Wallace Electro-Medical
Institutes of Health and Healing.
FAILING VIGOR.
When this begins to go, you
will twitch and show signs of
premature weakness. Fol-
lowing are some of the symp-
toms :
Your facial nerves twitch,
You are all run down,
Spots before your eyes,
The muscles twitch,
Pains in small of back,
Pains in head,
Shooting pains,
You feel fatigued,
You are weary,
Your head swims,
Your knees knock,
Your hand trembles.
NERVOUS TWITCH-
ING.
A nervous person easily gets all
of a tremble, gets fits of weak-
ness, fits of twitching.
Here are some symptoms :
Your eyes twitch,
Yotir hands tremble,
You feel shaky,
You walk haltingly,
You are melancholy,
Ringing in the ears,
Blood is poor,
Your eyes weak,
Your eyes bleary,
Your head swims.
DEBILITY.
This affliction destroys ambition,
organic strength, energy, and
hope. Following are symp-
toms :
You feel weak,
You feel cold,
Your back aches,
You lose flesh,
You sleep poorly,
Are low-spirited,
Your eyes sunken,
You have hot flushes,
Your memory impaired,
No real vigor,
You have sick headaches,
Nausea after eating,
Hands or feet moist,
Brightness leaves the eye.
DO NOT DELAY.— Delays are at all times dangerous. You would not throw away a grain of
gold ; neither would you discard a pearl of great price ; yet health is more to you than any of these.
What is the value of a million of money, doubled fourfoli}, to a millionaire, if his arteries are aneurised, or
his brain softenened beyond all hope of cure ? The moral of these facts lies in the proverbial truth—Do
not delay. PROCRASTINATION IS THE PRECIPICE BELOW WHICH YAWNS THE AWFUL GULF
OF DEATH. AVOID IT !
LOSE NO CHANCE. —Every man knows it is dangerous to trifle with disease. Yea might as
well stand at the mouth of a loaded cannon. While you have time, write to the SPECIALISTS at the
INSTITUTE; state your symptoms, act according to their instructions, and you will soon be your old
self again. Their record is a series of professional triumphs. THEY HAVE THOUSANDS OF TESTI-
MONIALS TO PROVE THEIR UNEQUALLED SKILL]
SURE
We publish here two testimonials out of the
thousands which we possess. They are from
gentlemen whose names are familiar in the commer-
cial and athletic spheres of Australia. They are
now strong and able-bodied men, happy in the con-
sciousness of renewed health and vitality:—
CURES.
MR. PATRICK LARKIN, J.P., of Sydney, after a brief
course of our medical methods, writes regarding
our Electro-Medical Treatment:—
“ I am satisfied it gives health and vigor to the
system. For some time my nerves were out of
tone, but now I am perfectly well, and have regained
my usual strength.”
MR. RALPH WELLS, of Melbourne, a Professional
Pugilist of very high order, and who recently
fought Jim Corbett, writes to us on October
Ist, 1904, thus :
“ It gives me pleasure to state I have been under
your methods, being run down and suffering from
poorness of blood, with its complications. A brief
course of treatment at your hands has had most
satisfactory results and I am myself again.”
FREE MEDICAL BOOK! !—During the Summer Season our great medical treatise, “Clinical
Experiences,” may be obtained FREE on application. It contains 600 pages, 150 medical illustrations,
and 31 chapters, replete with valuable information. The best Book for Men with Serious Ailments.
FACTS THAT DEFY ARGUMENT.
We are treating thousands of cases annually, and is it not reasonable to suppose that we under-
stand such cases better than those who are treating only a few hundred ?* Practice makes perfect in
any line, and it is none the less true in the treatment of disease. You get the benefit of Experience
when you place your case in our hands. Do not despair. Order your treatment at once, and let us
add your name to our long list of cures.
• * • • • *
If the slightest doubt exists in your mind that our treatment will not cure you, it is a duty you
owe to yourself to write to some of the references we; herein publish, and send an addressed envelope
for reply. Ask any of the attendants who have given their testimonies to us if they think we can
benefit you. We court the closest investigation, Our Parcel Post System is a blessing to all sick
men living in centres far from medical men and aid. Thousands of men would now be in their graves
had we not reached and treated them by our Parcel Post Sj'stem. Remember !we do not charge for
advice by letter.

AND AT MELBOURNE.
As Adelaide possesses the only cremation-
plant in the Commonwealth, it couldn’t let the
Medical Congress go away without a sight of the
machine at work. No candidate came along
appropriately (in fact, the demand does not average
more than about two corpses a year), so a deceased
sheep was placed in a wooden casket, and some
good roast mutton was overdone in the presence
of a critical but admiring crowd.
An engineer supplies this :
The Waranga xlasin, Victoria’s gigantic reservoir for
supplying the dry North-Western Mallee lands, has an
area of 19J square miles ; the Yan Yean, supplying- Mel-
bourne, has an area of only two square miles. The bank
to retain the water is 4J miles long, 137 ft. thick at the
base, and tapering to Bft. at the top, with an average
height of 24ft, The capacity of the reservoir is
53,750,000,000 gallons ; Yan Yean is 6,400,000,000 gallons.
The average depth of Waranga Basin when filled will be
17ft. The water from the Basin is to be taken as far as
Tyrrel Creek, 150 miles away, whilst Yan Yean to Mel-
bourne is only 19 miles. The supply channel, when run-
ning full, discharges 103,000 cubic feet per minute and
will fill the Basin in 58 days. A flow of water for 7Jmin.
from this channel would be Melbourne’s daily supply,
when consumption is greatest. The Basin is completed,
but all timber is being- removed from the bed. The Basin
will receive first water early in September this .year.
A general order issued in Sydney by
Governor Hunter in 1798, presented a remarkably
sane view of the relations between debtor and
creditor. The preamble ran
It having- been represented to the Governor that many
people who are concerned in petty dealings with every
description of inhabitants in this colony consider them-
selves at liberty to imprison the persons of their debtors,
when unable to discharge their demands, by which means
the public interest is materially injured and the Crown
deprived of the services of such debtors.
The order laid down that dealers who desired to
accommodate persons with credit must rely abso-
lutely upon the strength of their good faith in the
integrity of such people, and not on the notion
that they could arrest and imprison them by form
of law. To-day, creditors make the public support
petty debt courts as thumbscrews for their own
particular benefit.
M. Vladimir Tchertkoff, a banished
Russian, and friend of Tolstoy, living in London :
I do not find in general that the state of England is very
much better than the state of Bussia. There is the same
combination of oppressors and exploiters on the one
hand, and the oppressed and exploited on the other. The
laws in this country, as in Bussia, protect the wealth of
one man while allowing another to die of hunger.
Members of the House of Commons are not the repre-
sentatives of the people, but of the moneyed classes. The
voting of work-people is influenced by their employers.
A man cannot venture to become a parliamentary candi-
date unless he is prepared to spend several thousands of
pounds on his election.
In fashionable circles of St. Petersburg the interests,
especially of the women, take a more serious form than
their prototypes in the West End of London. I would
affirm, in fact, that women in Bussian high society are
more cultured than women of like position in England.
For example, these intelligent fashionable ladies in St.
Petersburg do not, and could not, read the trashy,
superficial literature devoured in the drawing rooms of
London.
A theory :
If the Norwegians can’t do without a King, why not get
an automatic figure with a phonograph attachment for
such phrases as “Bise, Sir Hjalmarl” “My dear people,”
“Grieves me to the heart,” “ Gives me much pleasure,”
&c. ? The clockwork interior would arrange for bowing,
saluting, cigar-smoking, and so on when the Groom of the
First-Floor Front pressed various buttons. A Queen and
Boyal Family could be provided on the same system.
These figures would have enormous advantages over
the present flesh-and-blood automatons. They would
perform official duties much more skilfully, and
all the nation need spend on their upkeep would be
a few shillings per annum for oil, benzine, and an
occasional coat of paint. When a bloodthirsty anarchist
stabbed the king in the mainspring, or threw a bomb at
his Majesty’s escapement, a new monarch, guaranteed
sound in wind and limb, could easily be procured for
about £lO. If Norway thinks kindly of this idea, I am
willing to give a free demonstration in Christiana with
my patent automatic State Governor, which I am sure
will convince them of the great merits of the system. I
am now perfecting a wooden Freetrade orator on similar
principles.

With Wounds that discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen, that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated, the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease,
if allowed to continue,will deprive you of thepower to waik.
You may have attended various hospitals and had medical
advice and been told your case is hopeless, or advised to
submit to amputation ; but do not, for I can cure you. I
don’t say perhaps, but I will. Because others have failed

young man full

turning them to the

Who would not

instead of going
through life list -
less, below concert
pitch, and seldom
or never at one’s
best, in conse -
quence of tiresome
colds, coughs,
throat, lung, skin
and blood troubles
and prostrating de-
bility? In Scott’s
Emulsion of cod
liver oil with gly-
cerine and the hypophospliites
of lime and soda we have an
admirable remedy for all these
things and especially for the
after-results, which are often
more prolonged and more de-
than the ailments them-
selves. Mr. Atkinson’s case is
typical of a thousand. From
the Government Labour Farm,
Pitt Town, Windsor, N. S. W.,
under date of August 18th, 1904,
he wrote us as follows :
“ 1 have always been a sufferer from
bronchitis, and could not obtain any
permanent relief, although I tried
various remedies. From the first ds>se
Scott’s Kmulsion benefited me, It
agreed well with me, and was quite
palatable. After taking it for a little
while, my cough was completely cured
and I have gained weight and feel
altogether much stronger and better
in general health.”
Exactly ! Scott’s Emulsion goes
to the root of the trouble —sets
to work instantly to build up the
vitality. Disease has no chance
with a thoroughly
vital man, and this
is the kind of man
which Scott’s Emul-
sion will make you.

“Nulla”: To what base use is the expression
“sports” relegated at the present time! It used, in
olden daj's, to denote those big, breezy men who loved
sport for its own sake, and were not particular as to how
they handled either fists or “fivers.” Nowadays it is
applied indiscriminately to the man who fervently hopes
that you may be struck dead before you strike him for
another paltry “ double,” the unwashed hoodlums who
yell “ fake ” whenever a beaten man refuses to be punched
to pieces in an effort to save their sixpenny wagers, and
the ruffian who expresses a desire to settle down to steady
work with an axe on the gallant horse that has suc-
cumbed to the handicap of weight and pace.

A police inspector estimates that 10,000 persons
in N.S.W. live by horse-racing, a third of the number
confining themselves almost wholly to pony-racing. At
£3OO a year each, the total income would be £3,000,000,
which sum the public voluntarily disburses for, in most
cases, an unsubstantial chance of getting the better of
one another.
* * * *
The totalisator in France has done all that was
expected at its inception in 1891. In 14 years the
Government’s share of totalisator profits comes to
£700,000, which sum has been disbursed to charities, for
educational purposes, and in improving the breed of horses.
Being welshed is not the limit of had fortune at
the racecourse, and a small Melbourne black-and-white
artist puts up a pathetic plaint in proof. He went to
Flemington on a recent race-day, and patronised the flat
from motives of economy. There he was moved by the
lust of wealth to put a very scarce shilling on a horse
which he w 7 as confidently assured was a dead cert. He
selected the most trustworthy-looking tote practitioner,
and then went for a walk. His horse won, and he re-
turned in quest of the tote, and found the man missing
and the spot he had occupied surrounded by a small,
angry crowd. As Black-’n’-White approached, an exas-
perated woman pointed at him, crying: “ Here’s his
cobber. I seen him talkin’ to him. Take it out of him.”
The crowd accepted the invitation with the thoughtless
enthusiasm of crowds. Black-’n’-White was rescued by
two policemen. He had onty tw 7 o black eyes, but he
thought he had fourteen, and there were so few 7 clothes
left upon him that he had to be put into Black Maria for
decency’s sake. Black-’n’-White’s chief grievance lies in
his belief that he w ; as hit by quite 500 people who hadn’t
any interest at all in the missing tote.

English owners take a lot of trouble over giving
their two-year-olds appropriate names. Here are some of
this season’s batch : Reconciliation (b3 7 Love Wisely out
of Sulks), Sealing Wax (Poste Restante—Red Speck),
Couleur de Rose (Enthusiast—Rose Root), Cagebird
(Prisoner—Lady Heron), Diving Bell (Merman—Doncaster
Belle), Cruelty (Janissary—Armenia), Sea Lion (Merman-
Lioness), and Tongue Tied (Father Confessor—Muzzle).
On the other hand, the bad old days of “ Here I Go with
my Eye out ” are recalled by tw 7 o new names, the inane
Not Very Busy (Nun thorpe—Relic) and Tommy up a Pear-
tree (Sir Geoffrey—Dulcemona)!
“F.C.”: Such sympathy as I have to spare is
not being wasted on that “party by the name of Gill,”
referred to herein a while back, who acquired a sweep
prize that didn’t belong to him. My sympathy is kept
for the syndicate that struck Tatt’s. for a £9O prize, the
draft for which a fool postman delivered to the wrong
Gill. The syndicate got a verdict, and started to recover,
but was knocked out in one act by the Law deciding
that the only property said to be possessed by the wrong
Gill aforesaid—three carts, two horses and some house-
hold furniture—in reality belonged to his wife and had
so belonged for a good while. The wrong Gill swore that
his earthly possessions amounted to 255., a few pigeons
and a pup or two, and that he had blewed most of the £9O
at two-up, whereupon the Law called him a “worthless
waster” and threw him out of court. Incidentally it
threw out the syndicate also, considerably poorer than
when it started to collect the £9O that rightfully belonged
to it. I’m not sure whether the syndicate or the wrong
Gill is the right person to hang a moral on.

Seth Ferry, one of the best-known sporting men
in S. Australia, sold all his horses and his estate (Sydney
Park) t’other day, and retires permanently from the turf.
His son, Sidney, who rode in many a race years ago, is
now manager of the York Hotel, Adelaide, and, like his
dad, has deserted the turf.
* * * *
The fashionable (English) Goodwood race-meet-
ing was the scene of about the most awful boil-over on
record. Black Arrow, the unrivalled youngster of this
season, came out in a field of three, all two-year-olds, and all
the same weight. A hundred to seven on was the official
price, but many sportsmen desirous of picking up easy
money laid 20 “ ponies ”to 1 on. And Black Arrow first
refused to face the barrier, then whipped round the wrong
way when it rose, and finally stuck his front hoofs so hard
in the turf that it took half-an-hour to coax him back to
his stable.

“ Yus,” said the spieler, gloomily, “ yer do hear
a lot about the confidence men in town, but some of the
mugs are fly enough for anything. When the warships
came over here last time, I picked up with a couple of
sailors, and had a pretty good time trotting them round
to the races. Of course they paid. Well, they went out
to Flemington on the last day of their leave, and I lost
sight of ’em for an hour or two. I met ’em in Flinders-
street after the races, and they seemed fair down in the
dumps. It came out that they’d lost on every .race but
the last. That was the Footscray Steeple—you remember
The African won it, and Sweet Alice ran second. They’d
backed The African to win ’em twelve quid, and when
they went to collect the bookie had vanished. So they
was fair stony. They showed me the ticket, and I
jumped. It was one of the straightest bookies on the
hill, and I supposed the fools had looked in the wrong
place for him. Well, as I’d had a quid or two out of
them, I didn’t want to be hard, so I offered them a pound
for the ticket. They took it, and that was the last I saw
of them. Next Saturday I bowls up to the bookie at
Caulfield. ‘ Wots this ? ’ says he. ‘My b@t op The Afri-
can for the Steeple at Flemington,’ Isays. ‘ Did you
make the bet yerself ? ” he asks, while his clerk turned up
the sheets. I said I did. ‘ Oh,’ says he, ‘ did yer ? Well
let me inform you, you beer-chewin’ clown, that that
“T.A.” on this ticket isn’t “ T.A.” at all. It’s “ S.A.” for
Sweet Alice, or it was when I wrote it, only some fool’s
been altering the “S”to a “ T”.’ Then he called a John,
and the John called a cab, and a man named Panton
called me some names, and for the last six months they’ve
been callin’ me No, 48, ”

“G. H. : I read The Bulletin’s remarks of
August 31, anent the anti-Tattersall crusade, while coming
into town on a St. Kilda tram. Got off the gradual
vehicle at the corner of Bourke and Swanston streets, and
walked up past the Victorian Club. The people whom
The Bulletin mentioned were congregated around. There
were faces one might have aimed grindstones at without
effect—faces that reminded one of a hard-boiled curse.
Their language left dark brown stains on the atmos-
phere. Their talk was of ’orse, and of ’orse only. Poetry,
painting, sculpture, music—one might as well have men-
tioned Euripides’ grandmother there, for all they knew
about them. That herd summed up the product of the
cheap suburban racecourse—Australia’s Great National
Disaster. Crossed over towards the city tote-shop, and
struck another deputation of the same class. It was a
beautiful spring morning, and that crowd of thieves was
greatly exalted in spirit. There were races at Ascot in
the afternoon, and those vice-charred faces were going
out there. I thought of John Milton’s blank verse
picture of Satan and company ; also I thought _of
the noblg ’orse whose breed is always being im-
proved with the assistance of people just like these.
Pieces of broken commandments lay all over the land-
scape, and spielerdom dug its feet into the fragments and
remarked that it was a boshter day. Forth from a pub,
near by came half-a-dozen “ books,’’-with their waistcoats
and their lower chins waving triumphantly before them.
The mob opened out and stood in a reverent attitude, and
yearned silentlj 7 . Half-a-dozen assorted cabs waited along
the kerb. The arch-waistcoat nodded pleasantly to the
foremost cabby, and loaded himself into the vehicle.
Another waistcoat clambered in with him ; the rest cursed
their affable way into four-wheelers, and the procession of
sharks and punters rattled off. And a few men with
grindstone faces, who probably hadn’t the means to go
out to the course, shuffled about on the flags and broke
more commandments.

HOW many thousands of
men and women have
gone through life miserable
and broken in body and
spirt because they did not
attend to that first symptom
of impending evil ? . The
nerve eentre at the small of
the back becomes weak, the
kidneys become congested,
irritation and pain set in,
and “ Bright’s Disease of

at the finish.
Ei.ectricity, properly

new life into the nerve cen-

MEDICATOR.
Catarrh is inflammation of
the lining' membrane of the
nose and adjoining passages.
If this inflammation is not
arrested it invades the pas-
sages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the
sight and hearing, destroys
the sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the
small frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and sto-
mach, causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want
relief and cure? If so, try

Making Money
I was bom on a Maine farm. I have made some
great successes in business. My greatest through
Co-operation.
I took SI,SOO f.£306:2:6) capital, supplied by
Farmers, Women, Physicians, Clerks, Clergymen,
etc., in Belfast, Maine, and in an honest, but very
profitable business, earned and paid them through
BELFAST NATIONAL BANK, $5,000 (£1,020:8:2)
In Cash dividends in the first six months, $25,000
(£5,102:0:10) in cash dividends within the next
year, and in 18 months I paid them in round
numbers $380,000.00 (£67,346:19:2) CASH.
Every 4s. Earned £ 44:17s

This is HISTORY. Beads
like a fairy tale but it is
TRUE. I made poor
people rich. They helped
me earn the riches. Just
read that over again. I
had SI,SOO. I earned
and paid my stockholders
$330,000 in cash in 18
months. Every stock-
holder got their share.
That’s my Way of doing
business. You must be-
lieve this statement is
TRUE, for, if I wereiying,
I wouldn’t tell you the
place where I earned the
money, and the BANK
where it was paid.
I have learned the great
Value of the right kind of
co-operation, learned how
to make money fast in an
honest, profitable busi-
ness from which millions
are made every year.
I now have a new busi-
ness of the same kind,
only my field is the World.
It is incorporated under
the laws of the State of
Maine and the TJ. S. Gov’t. The Stockholders are
absolutely protected from any liability. They are
safe guarded by law. My plan one of extended co-
operation. Stockholders everywhere who can give
me information and lend their INFLUENCE. The
dividends must be large.
I already have 4.000 stockholders in the IT. S.,
Canada, England, Cuba, Mexico, Sandwich Islands,
Gibraltar, etc. I want a few more. The shares
are going fast. You can invest 4s. or £IOO.
Monthly payments, if you wish. It will be safe
and we will make it grow. This is no gambling
or “shady” scheme. It’s legitimate business.
You will be treated squarely and honestly.
I place 30 years of untarnished business record
behind that statement. I only ask you in your
own interest to INVESTIGATE. You shall have all
the Proof you want. References, Bankers, Bus-
iness Men, Church and Public Officials, etc. Send
your address on a postal card. It will pledge
you to nothing. It may mean your fortune. I
will send a 24-page book,

to the Ox.” Stop plodding. Lift your head long
enough to ask me to prove every statement in this
ad. This is your opportunity, don’t miss it. Don t
Wait if you want something betterthanyouhavegot.

The £17,000 or £lB,OOO lying in the
Elingamite, wrecked at the Three Kings (M.L.)
in 1902, still excites the cupidity of treasure-

Thursday Island diver.
A big man in the Yic. public service gave
a fancy-dress ball on the occasion of his eldest
son’s 21st birthday a few weeks back, and there
was a large attendance, and bright the lights
shone o’er fair women and brave men. As a rule,
guests at a fancy-dress ball prefer to appear in
magnificent and heroic guises, but there were a
few at this festival whose costumes suggested
modesty, and one whose make-up was, eloquent of
humility. He was a Weary William of the
weariest. His clothes looked as if they had been
hired from a professional, and a specialist at that,
and his facial make-up was a marvel of Weary
Williamism. Nobody recognised the guest
under his perfect disguise, and the cleverness he
displayed in living up to the character delighted
the assemblage for an hour or two, but presently
there arose a doubt. It was thought Willie’s
drunkenness was too realistic to be simulated, and
about this time the weary one’s behavior was
thought by staid and elderly persons to be a trifle
over the mark. Later even the young and
careless were inclined to agree with this
opinion, and the host was moved to remonstrate
with his guest. He remonstrated like a gentle-
man, but the disguised one struck him
frankly in the eye. Willie was sent to, Coventry
in a corner, while guests sought a policeman. “ I
merely wish to have him removed,” said the host.
“ He is a guest of mine, and I want no scandal.”
“A guest!” cried the officer. “Bless you, sir,
his name’s Jones, and he isn’t in disguise ; he’s in
his natural state. He’s the most chronic loafer in
the six States, and he’s got more gall than a Syrian
hawker.” Jones was fined next day for drunken-
ness and insulting behavior, but the court was not
told the really interesting part of the tale.

COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, AND CONSUMPTION,
HAS THE LARGEST SALE OF ANY CHEST MEDICINE IN THE WORLD.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or
Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com-
forting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has
never been known to exist where “ Coughs " have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
find a Complete Cure is certain.
BEWARE OF COUGHS !
REMEMBER THAT EVERY DISEASE HAS ITS COMMENCEMENT, AND CONSUMPTION IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE.

Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir, —Please send me by return post
one large bottle of your Bronchitis Cure, for which please
find payment enclosed. I had a terrible cough, caused by
measles. It was tearing me to pieces. I chanced to have
a small quantity of your Bronchitis Cure, took one dose,
and improved immediately. I like to always have some
on hand. It is well worth a testimonial on account of
what it has done for me, and you are at liberty to make
use of what I have written. This is not the first time it
has done me good.—Yours truly,

Completely cured by
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.

Dear Sir,—Twelve years ago I had a severe attack of
Influenza and Bronchitis, and for ten years was suffering
with a terrible cough, and was wasting away. I had
medical attendance, and tried various medicines recom-
mended, but without success until, on my daughter’s
recommendation, I used Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, with
the result that it completely cured me, and I am per-

No other treatment did any good.
Mr. Hearne. Sir,—My daughter, 12 years of age, had
a very bad cough that had been a great trouble to her for
years. 1 tried every cough remedy I could get, but not
one of them seemed to do her any good. Then I tried
one bottle of your Bronchitis Cure, and she has never
coughed since she finished it. lam glad to say the effect

ASTHMA 25 YEARS.
Immediately relieved by Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir.—l have been a martyr
to Asthma for about 25 years, and have tried almost all
known remedies for the complaint, and have been under
the treatment of leading Physicians throughout the
Australian States. I determined to try no more, but let
nature take its course. Two years ago I was asked to try
your Asthma Cure, but laughed at the idea, However,
by the persuasion of a very old friend, 3 weeks ago I
commenced the first bottle of your treatment. Almost
immediately I found that I had made a mistake by not
taking it before. lam now about half-way through the
second bottle, and so much do I feel relieved that I take
this opportunity of sending this testimonial along for you
to make whatever use you may think fit. I intend
continuing your treatment, and I trust that before I have
finished the third bottle I shall be able to write to you
that lam perfectly cured. lam pleased to say the effect
has been wonderful.
Yours very gratefully, PHIL. HANN,
33 Camden St., Balaclava, Victoria.
BRONCHITIS.
A South Australian storekeeper testifies
to the Efficacy of Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure.
A sufferer 70 years old cured by it.
Well and hearty now.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir,—l am a storekeeper,
living in this township for the last 20 years. One of my
oldest customers has been subject to Bronchitis for a
number of years, and has been in the hospital with it
several times. Hearing of your valuable medicine, he
tried it, and found that it gave him great relief. One
bottle was sufficient to put him right. This gentleman
is over 70 years of age, an old bushman who has been in
these parts for the last 30 years, and is well known. He
makes my house his home when here, and got the medi-
cine from me. He is at my place now, and he says that
this winter is the freest he has had from Bronchitis for a
number of years, and he wishes to return you thanks for
your valuable Bronchitis Cure. He is well and hearty
now. You are quite at liberty to publish this or any part
of it you like, as it may be of great benefit to other people
suffering from Bronchitis.—Yours truly,

cure your medicine has effected in my case. About three
years ago I began to cough. At first the cough was not
severe, but it gradually got worse, and I became very
weak and troubled with night sweats, pain in my chest,
and great quantities of phlegm. On several occasions
there was blood in the expectorated matter. I had been
treated by a doctor, who pronounced my case to be con-
sumption, and various other treatments had been tried,
but without benefit. It was at this stage that I heard of
your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for a course of the
medicine. When it arrived, I was too ill to leave my bed,
but I commenced taking it at once, and gradually im-
proved. lam glad to say that the two lots of medicine
you sent have effected a complete cure, for which accept
my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,
J. BLAIR,
Westminster-bridge Road, S.E., London.
Distressing, suffocating, dry cough for twelve
years.
Entirely removed by five doses of Heame’s
BroncMtis Cure.
No other treatment could even ease it.
Sir,—My wife was for twelve years a sufferer from most
distressing, suffocating, dry cough, that could not be re-
moved or even eased by any remedy, doctors’ prescrip-
tions and patent medicines having been tried ; but I am
happy to state that the cough, pain in the chest, and dif-
ficulty of breathing, etc., were entirely removed by the
fifth dose of your Bronchitis Cure.—l remain, sir, yours
most respectfully,

pleased with the results of your wonderful medicine, as a
small bottle cured my little girl, who had been suffering
for five years, and now I do not feel safe to be without it.

GRAVEL AND STONE CAN BE
CURED.
From Mr. G. Lucas, tobacconist, Kapunda, S.A., 7th December, 1904.
“ I have great pleasure in recommending Warner’s Safe Cure to anyone troubled with gravel,
knowing from personal experience what suffering one undergoes when once this dreadful complaint is
contracted, and how it unfits him for the most ordinary duties of life. I suffered for a long time and
was unable to get relief. My urine was thick and ropy, and at times full of dark colored sediment; at
other times it was of a green color. I was almost afraid to drink anything, knowing the burning pains
I would have to endure. My stomach was very irritable, my digestion bad with little appetite, and
sweats at night. I became seriously alarmed after trying many remedies without obtaining any
benefit. A friend, living at Kapunda, who had been cured of the same complaint by Warner's Safe
Cure, advised me to try it. I had very little faith, but I took his advice, and commenced taking
Warner’s Safe Cure and Warner’s Safe Pills. After talcing the first few doses I was greatly
relieved, my water became less impregnated with foreign matter, and the pain decreased and
gradually left me. I continued with the medicine, and after taking it for some time a large stone
passed from me. From this time I improved in health. It is several years ago since I was cured. I
am now in good health, and have not had a return of the complaint since.”
From Mr. James Fabian, Newstead, Breakfast Creek Road, Brisbane, Q., 11th February, 1905.
“ About two and a half years ago my little daughter, at that time six and a half years of age,
suffered severely from kidney colic and paralysis. She lost the use of her arms and legs, and the pain
was almost continuous. She could get no rest at night, and kept all of us awake by her screaming
from the pain. We had a doctor attending her for nine months, but his treatment did her no good.
He told us he had not much hope that she would get better. I happened to read one of your
pamphlets which was left at my house, and saw the symptoms of kidney colic described. I decided
to give Warner’s Safe Cure a trial. After my daughter had taken the first dose it seemed to give her
ease, and she went to sleep. We continued to give her the medicine until she had taken, in all, six
bottles, and could see her improve with every bottle she took. It is over twelve months ago since she
had the last dose. Warner’s Safe Cure restored her to health, and she has not required medicine of
any kind since. You can make what use you like of this letter, as I cannot speak too highly of
Warner’s Safe Cure in cases of kidney colic.”
From Mr. S. J. Wadrop, Mount Barker, S.A., 3rd December, 1904.
“For several years I suffered excruciating pain in the region of the kidneys, hip and groin,
I became so ill and weak that life became a burden to me, and it was torture to me to do any
manual work. I tried many medicines, but could obtain no relief that was permanent. I was
then advised to take a course of Warner’s Safe Cure, and, after taking a few bottles of that
medicine, a large stone passed from me and gave me great and immediate relief. From that time
forward my health continued to improve, I gained in weight and strength, the unbearable pain
was entirely removed, and I was once again in vigorous health and strength. The stone, which is
of large size, I have preserved, and it can be seen by anyone who will call upon me, and I shall
have great pleasure in telling personally my experience.”
From Mr. G. H. Robinson, Harbor View, Watson’s Bay, N.S.W., 29th September, 1903.
“I have much pleasure in testifying as to the value of Warner’s Safe Cure, as, gradually, and
without pain, it removed a stone from my kidneys, which had been accumulating for years.”
From Mr. A. Spiers, 98 Moorehead-street, Redfern, N.S.W., 10th February, 1904.
“About six years ago I was a great sufferer from gravel and kidney trouble. My doctors said I had
Bright’s Disease of the kidneys. My sight, too, became very impaired. I tried Turkish baths and
many other remedies without obtaining relief. I was in misery for at least 18 months, when a friend
advised me to give Warner’s Safe Cure a trial. I did so, taking also Warner’s Safe Bills, and in nine
weeks I was a new man. I attribute my recovery solely to Warner’s medicines, as I have not suffered
in any way since.”
From Mr. John F. Kennedy, Argyle-street, Parramatta, N.S.W., 22nd September, 1903.
“ Some years ago I was attacked by great pains in the kidneys and bladder, accompanied by
swelling in the groin. The pain was so severe that, even when lying in bed, I could scarcely bear it,
whilst to walk across the room was agony. I was treated by doctors off and on for five years, and at
last they told me it was no use giving me any more medicine, but to take care of myself and to take
plenty of nourishment. I was laid up, feeling very bad, when I happened to read one of your pam-
phlets. I sent for some Warner’s Safe Cure, and continued taking it for three months. After taking
three or four bottles it brought gravel in great quantities from me, and I was soon able to get up and
walk about after three months on my back. I am well known in Parramatta, and people were sur-
prised to see the way I had improved after taking Warner’s Safe Cure. I went to the chemist from
whom I bought the medicine, and when I showed him the gravel it had brought from my system he
said it was marvellous.”
From Mr. James Grant, Grocer, 126 Young Street, Annandale, N.S.W., 12th February, 1903.
“Some ten years ago I was attacked by great pains in my back and groin, which at times were so
severe that I almost screamed with agony. I was treated by doctors for fully five years, and also
tried several patent medicines, but obtained no relief. I at last despaired of ever getting well again,
but was recommended by a friend to try Warner’s Safe Cure, as it had given him immense relief in a
similar case. I followed his advice, and after taking the medicine for a while I passed a Stone about
three-quarters of an inch long and a quarter of an inch wide. lam pleased to say that after this stone
had come away my sufferings were at end, a.nd I have not suffered in the slightest degree since. Many
of my friends know of my case, and I always keep the stone I passed. I can confidently recommend
Warner’s Safe Cure in cases like mine, as I am thoroughly convinced that it saved me many years of,
agony, if not my very life itself.”

The Melbourne Burns.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Melbourne Burns statue, erected by the subscrip-
tions of fat Presbyterians in that city, stands in St.
Kilda road, on a lawn where drunks go “ to sleep it off ” by
day, and youths and maids make love at night. It faces
the hill where the anarchist lectures are given on
Sundays.
BAD Bobbie Burns’s brazen, graven statue
Stands gazing mutely o’er the Yarra
slope;
With plaintive eyes that oft seem looking
at you,
Instinct with life and joy and love and hope.
He hears the lads and lassies gaily frolic;
Rebellion, red and raging, meets his gaze ;
While shakily, in accents alcoholic,
The local bards his shifting shadows praise.
Who pledged his memory, elate and rolling,
Refused a drink at Young and Jackson’s, turns
To dodge a “copper ” on the bridge patrolling,
Knowing he’s safe ’neath good old Bobbie Burns.
Burns earned the love of those who love good
liquor;
Few days went by before their hearts he knew ;
For what the new Australian knows as “shikkar”
Is just another word for good old “ fou.”
Then comes the dusk with scent and color laden,
Bringing the couples round his feet to tell
The tale that e’er is told by youth and maiden —
The game he played, the tale he told so well.
Each smiling lass in openwork and frillies
His own loved reckless Pagan spirit brings ;
Discomfiting the local Holy Willies
And breaking Sabbaths—also other things.
With “Don’t!” and “Stop it, now!” and sighs
and giggles
They run the gamut of the world of love,
Forgetful in their kisses and their wriggles
The feelings of the brazen bard above.
As he’d have told their story all would know it
In detail; but, alas ! we have our fears
That writing so would land a modern poet
In penal servitude for seven years.
On Sundays come the sounds of Demos stemming
Oppression’s tide, and o’er the valley swell
The accents loud of anarchistic Fleming,
Giving the bloated capitalist ’Ell.
From his high eminence the blood-red banner
Floats free before his eyes, a badge of truth ;
Their zeal, he knows, atones for faults of manner,
Sincerity refines the phrase uncouth.
The man’s the man, his instinct is the people’s,
He knows their coarse vulgarity is still
Free from the cant that spreads beneath the
steeples
That cluster past the stream, upon the hill.
They preach the mercy of the gentle Saviour,
Yet if He were alive and going large,
They’d shoot Him in for riotous behavior,
And turn up at the court to press the charge.
So turns the bard where laughing lassies frolic,
The rag of Hate the futile rebels raise,
The poets, in iambics alcoholic,
Sing, bask, and sleep through the long summer
days.

Caesar—or Nothing!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
girl hesitated for a moment before
the half-open studio door. “Arthur
Mowle”—she read the name, and again,
with the mechanical reiteration of nervousness,
raised a timid hand, and dropped it. A second
spasm of courage; the Rubicon was crossed.
“ Come in” a voice invited, irritably.
As she entered, the artist was wheeling an easel,
which held a large canvas, face round towards the
wall; whilst a sulky girl, half in, half out of her
clothes, glared viciously at his back. This girl
nodded sullenly at the new arrival as she hurried
back behind her screen, for it was a cold day, and
even the delight of making surreptitious grimaces
at “that beast” was as nought compared to the
real satisfaction of warm clothing.
The artist faced his visitor abruptly. “ Well ? ”
His eye caught the trembling appeal of her lips,
and the mistiness of unshed tears. “Sit down,”
he said, more gently, and placed a chair for her.
She took the proffered comfort. “Now”—he
looked keenly at her, she was undoubtedly very
pretty—“you come for sittings, eh ? ”
“Yes, sir.”
“ Sat before ? ”
“Oh, yes, sir, To Mr. Ferguson and Mr.
Garnet, and ”
His gesture waived further references. “ Right !
Nude, of course? And—please don’t misunder-
stand me—but I have a rooted objection to being
‘sirred ’ or ‘esquired.’ ”
“Yes, s—. Yes.”
“ Uin-m ! ” He drummed with his fingers upon
his desk. She noted the fine capability of the
restless hands. “Well, Ido want a model; and
I think you might suit me.” He thought of his
Psyche, hung up on account of an over-con-
scientious objection to composite creation from
the good features of many divers models. This
girl seemed a gift from Heaven. “Stand up a
minute.” He noted her height and slim graceful-
ness, and motioned her to be seated again. “ Yes,
I think you’ll do. You don’t mind sitting to a
mixed class? Might as well do that while you’re
here. Eh ? ”
“ Oh, no ; I’ve sat to classes often.”
“ Good ! Suppose we say Monday, then—half-
past nine sharp. And, meanwhile, if you’d like ”
His hand dived into his pocket.
“ Oh, no ; I have plenty.” But she recognised
the real thoughtfulness of the offer. Gould this
be the man of whom the other girls had told her
such hair-raising tales? Of brushes, paint tubes
flung in wrath; of three-hour sittings without
rests ; of bad language and brutal sarcasms upon
their personal appearance? She decided im-
pulsively that they must have deserved these
things. She was not very far wrong. Mowle
was, beneath his manner, all kindness and con-
sideration to those who did not seek to take
advantage of him. To those who did —well, the
Lord had fitted him with a bitter tongue. She
divined, moreover, that he was a man to trust.
Of how few of her former employers had she felt
this ! There had with most of them, rightly or
wrongly, appeared the necessity of arm’s-length
treatment. They were certainly more suave, more
polite, than this man; but—she shuddered at a
swift, ashamed recollection of the one who had
seemed the most courteous of them all.
She recalled her errant thoughts with something
of a shock, suddenly conscious that the artist was
watching her with amused curiosity. “Oh ! I
beg your pardon. I ought to” She rose
nervously.
He smiled. “ All right—goodbye.”
He heard her footsteps grow faint upon the
stairs, and leaned back in his chair. What luck !
He began to see his Psyche now. The sulky
model emerged from her lair, buttoning her jacket.
“You won’t want me any more, then ?”
“No ; I don’t fancy I shall.” His tone goaded
her into the open, futile impertinence of the dis-
charged housemaid.
“ Well, I’m not sorry.”
“ Thank you.” He counted out her wages.
“ I’m sorry for her, though, poor thing—sitting
till she’s one big cramp, and her head snapped off
if she moves, and ”
“ Shut the door after you. Thank you.”
* * * *
And so Amy Penn entered into the life of the
Mowle studio. She sat for the classes, and for
the master. The “Psyche” was completed, and
still she reigned, queen of the big, red, baize-
covered dais. Because of her beauty she became
a sort of cult amongst the students, being, like
the armless Venus, identified in some obscure way
with their raw dreams of Art. Even the girls,
since she, from her humble station, could never
hope to display her loveliness in their markets,
petted her and made much of her. The winter
passed, and the gas-stove near the dais was no
longer needed. The summer grew big in fulfil-
ment of the promise of a spring unduly warm, and
the naked model felt that there were compensa-
tions, as she watched the students in their clothes.
For the heat under the glass roof of the class-room
was terrific. But she had by this time reached a
state in which there was neither heat nor cold for
her. Into her heart had fallen and germinated
the seed of the red flower of love.
The conviction of her passion had come to her
suddenly, leaving her weak and frightened, but
strangely exultant for the rest of that day. The
pose had been difficult—a raised right arm and
thrown-back head are apt to become labor in the
third period of the model's morning. She listened
to the city chimes—how far apart the quarters
were. And, just before the luncheon hours,
“Psyche ” slipped loosely to the floor, her face very
white, her hands clenched. The students lost
their heads, retaining sufficient presence of mind
to call Mowle, skilled in emergencies. After
which their brains failed entirely, and they stood
watching him with awe-stricken wonder. She
therefore, upon her return to consciousness, found
herself resting on his arm, while he gave direc-
tions and orders to the collection of awkward
helplessness about him. And she realised, in one
swift flash, that her dearest desire pointed towards
a never-ending continuance of this limp passivity.
Always after this incident, as she posed, a
gleaming delight of bewildering curves and
dimples, she waited but for one presence. As
the master entered, the chatter would cease sud-
denly. Nothing was to be heard but the soft burr
of charcoal Michallet or the flap of a duster. Her
eyes followed him as he stepped briskly from easel
to easel, very sparing of praise, curt, incisive in
corrective criticism.
“Ah! more like a cow than a woman. Rub
it out and try again.” A chamois duster would
whisk out the offending drawing.
“Yes. Not bad. But hard —hard. A little
more tenderness perhaps——Just look—the
graciousness of that fall of flesh. From the
shoulder over the collar-bone (see the dimple on
the upper edge)—in one lovely sweep to the
breast. And study more carefully your tone-
passages—how subtle they are! Don’t be too
downright. And some day ” His hands
expressed attainment.
Amy glowed delightedly. Graciousness—
subtlety—in her body. He had said it. He
reached the next drawing.
“Um-m! Can't you see? Why! you’ve
made her a shrivelled old woman. She’s young—
fresh —pretty. You’ve altered her every curve
to an angle. Every suggestion of the under-
lying bone you’ve accentuated into a horrible
knob. Look at the large masses when you draw.
One needs breadth first. ”
And much more in this strain. After which he
passed from the room, leaving at least one of its
occupants supremely happy. How could she
understand that Mowle, with the artist’s suscep-
tibility to beauty, viewed her charms as he would
view a fine sunset or any other excelling piece of
Nature’s craft, given to him by a kind heaven to
admire and to paint ? Yet at times there seemed to
have entered the girl’s mind flashes of despairing
insight into the hopelessness of it all. For the
class would notice that she became dull and heavy
for days at a time. Then —she knew she was
foolish—but had not kings stooped ? Wherefore
she continued in that hope without which she felt
that her life would be a grey pilgrimage of vain
longing.
* * # *
Few give credit for virtue, still fewer for senti-
ment, to those young women who hire out their
bodies to the gaze of men at so much an ho 'r.
Regrettably, this distrust of virtue in the model’s
calling is, in the main, too well-founded. But
there are exceptions, and for the rest—there i -e
temptations, and poverty cannot consider too
nicely. Who, besides, can afford to cast the first
stone ?
Such an exception was Amy Penn. She had
passed through the semi-licensed freedom of the
studios unscathed. And, as for sentiment, her
love was a truer, more vital principle, than the
sentimental fancy of the brown-haired girl with
the infantile blue eyes who shared her worship,
drew so badly, and wept so copiously at the
master’s unsparing criticism. In short, the sur-
prising model possessed the sensibility which is
usually and erroneously supposed to belong only
to the elect.
This being clearly understood, the psychological
sequences which led up to the unfortunate climax
may be considered as fairly obvious. In the first
place we see Mowle, aggressive, short-tempered,
suffering from a rheumatic shoulder, stalk into the
studio. And, upon the subject of the pet pupil’s
drawing, he made unpleasant remarks.
“ Ah ! ” One who knew him in those days can
imagine the polite sarcasm of his tone. “Ah!
Very pretty. But—it isn’t her. I want you to
draw exactly what you see. Those feet, now.
Might have been drawn from a Greek marble.
Look at hers. Cramped, deformed even, % tight
boots. And her hands—almost plebeian. Look
at your drawing. And her right shoulder—higher
than her left. Save idealism for your pictures
when you paint ’em; It’s out of place i,n studies.”
Take a rest,” he nodded carelessly to his
broken-hearted Psyche.
It was all so pathetically simple after that.
She stepped off the dais, mechanically stretching
her cramped limbs. But the pain at her heart
could not be cured. It had gone too deep even
for tears. That he whom she loved should have
shamed her—publicly. It is easy to imagine her
thoughts as she went miserably home to her little
room. She saw now that he could never love her,
must even be unaware of her presumptuous affec-
tion. Then the flickering of the gaslight in the
draught from the open window arrested her atten-
tion.
“Yes, poor little thing.” Arthur Mowle was
sadly reminiscent. “It was never explained A
lovely girl-sat for my Psyche, you know ' To
think of her doing that-Good Lord! Why on
earth ?” He broke off dmmminer
fingers upon his desk ’ dr ™ing, with his
Garnet hinted uncharitably ; Mowle grew hot

AND HOW TO AVOID THEM.
w
HEN you are Bilious every thought of food is nauseous. When the
room gets warm you feel as if you are going to be sick. If you hurry
to catch a car or a train, there the feeling is again. Headaches,
turning off with sickness, a nasty coated tongue, are other symptoms
of Biliousness, and a symptom most distressing to the female sex is the
fearful green-yellow color which the
face comes to have if Biliousness is
allowed to continue. All this arises
from misdirected bile, which is due,
primarily, to improper liver action.
Mrs. M. Jordan, of Kelly-street, Scone,
N.S.W., says:—“For many years I
have been a martyr to Biliousness.
Almost every fortnight I would have an
attack, and try what I would I could
get no relief. The pain in my head
was unbearable, and also the pain across
my eyes. After eating I would vomit
terribly. I tried several so-called
remedies, but could gain no relief. I
then decided to give Bile Beans a trial,
although I had little faith in them after
my experiences with other medicines.
To my surprise I gained relief from the
first dose. Thus encouraged, I con-
tinued with the Beans, following the directions closely, and now can truth-
fully say I am enjoying splendid health, and have never had a bilious attack
since I first began using Bile Beans. My work is now a pleasure, and my
friends have noticed the great improvement there is in me. Words cannot
express my gratitude to you for your wonderful medicine, and I hope that
many other sufferers from Biliousness will be persuaded to try Bile .Beans.

THE Ancient World was hard and wise,
Its fierce old gods hold still their sway—
Murder, and Greed, and Lust and Lies,
We call them in this latter day.
Hawk-beaked and hungry-hearted gods,
And unforgiving deities;
Their sceptres were revengeful rods ;
They held the Future on their knees.
O Pagan ancestors of mine
This hand that writes shall soon be dust,
But we shall drink celestial wine
Together yet —for God is just.
One night my heart was filled with gloom,
And then there came—l know not how—
A Shining Presence in the room
Who kissed me softly on the brow.
There is a steep and narrow street
That in my waking dreams I see,
And One walks there with bleeding feet
Upon His way to Calvary.
The Milky Way, whose star-world’s gem
The night, is but a breath —a name —
To that small street, Jerusalem,
Which is your Glory and your Shame.
He was not by the nations hailed
As Savior of the World ; not He,
But on His Symbol he was nailed—
An Everlasting guarantee.
And though they were so hard and wise
I see, the gulf of years across,
With wringing hands, and weeping eyes,
The old gods following the Cross.
Who fears dark Death and After-Death
He has not heard your message free,
O Carpenter of Nazareth !
O Beachcomber of Galilee !

Master of Ceremonies had piloted
the “larncers” through without argument,
and was standing at the entrance to the
’all, “ ’avin’ a bit of a dror.” The small boys in
the street had left off their play to gaze on him
admiringly, and a bunch of ladies waited within
the doorway till the hero would return “ ’n’
speak.”
The M.C. said : “I ain’t got no objections to
enny bloke interviewing me, coz, bli’me, I done
nothin’ ter get meself set; but if they want me

see that bit o’ melon in the ’eliotrope ? Well, I’ve
knowed 'er ter darnce all Sunday, part o’ Sunday
night, all Monday, ’n’ faint at ’er work on the
Toosday. Of course, a bloke can't keep it up like
them, y’ know, ’specially if ’e works in a brick-
yard, ’n’ ’as ter empty a ’ot kiln first thing next
mornin’. {Ov course, most ov us works ! ’Ow the
’ell d’ yer think we keep the ’all goin’ ?)
“ A M.C.’s got ter keep ’isself very select, ’n
not ’ave too much talk ter the ladies, ’coz it starts
jealousy among ’em, ’n’ that leads ter rows, ’n
when wimmen starts rowin’ —well, the on’y way
ter stop ’em is ter turn the lights out on ’em. _ A
M.C.’s got ter be very careful about strange girls
comin ter the ’all until ’e finds out whether they
ain’t married. A good M.C. can tell a married
lady quick ’n’ smart. She’s forwarder-like—tells
a better tale, ’n’ is always dead anxious for yer
ter see ’er ter the corner ov ’er street. An ex-
perienced M.C. always stands clear of the girl
wot’s anxious for yer ter see ’er ’ome. Before I
got my experience I—but I’ll tell yer the tale.
“A married chap named Podgie—l never see
’is wife up till this—and three other chaps thought
they’d ’ave a lark with me, so they writes a love
letter askin’ me to meet Lizzie Dough—a girl I
’ad me eye on —at the corner of Mugg’s Alley on
We’n’sday night at ten o’clock. See ? ’N’ they
signs Lizzie's name. I thought it strange of
Lizzie, coz I never could make no headway with
’er, ’n’ she’d never gimme a chance to do a dash.
Of course the joke was that I should turn up at 10
o’clock to keep the meet ’n’ find—not Lizzie —but
these four chaps, ’n’ then they’d ’ave the laugh o’
me. I didn’t get the letter till the Thursday.
Enny’ow on the We’n’sday night a strange girl
turns up at the darnce—a charmer, she wuz, ’n’
she ’ooks me quick ’n’ lively. She drugs me with
a tale that she was nervous at being out late, ’n’
that ’er old mother would be waitin’ up for ’er
with corfee ’n’ arrer-root biscuits; she sez
’er mother never see a M.C., ’n’ she’d
like ’er ter bring one ter the ’ouse.
Proud like, I starts off ter see ’er ’ome—
she said she lived in Mugg’s Alley. Just as we
turns the corner ov the alley who should we run
into but Podgie an’ the three other coves? They
laughed—then yer could have druv nails inter the
stillness. Me ’n’ ’er passes right on. All ov a
suddent I ’ears footsteps behind me like someone
runnin’, ’n’ on lookin’ round I sees Podgie cornin’
at me with ’arf a palin’ fence an’ a lump o’ kerb-
stone. ’E bangs the girl ’n’ charges me, but, no
chance —I done a Carrington. Next day she
come to where I was workin’ ’n’ starts abusin’ me
like ’ell for not settlin’ Podgie with a road apple.
She was Podgie’s wife. So yer see ’ow careful yer
got ter be. A M.C. is a proud position—’n’ bein’
the glassy agate o’ the company the other blokes
gets ’orrible jealous, ’n’ yer got ter be able ter
take yer own part; that’s all that’s in it.”
ROBERT HAP.
Poetry Versus Prose.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YOU’RE so prosaic,” pouted Pretty
Girl.
“Ah, Pretty Girl!” sighed he.
Campbell always called her his “ Pretty Girl ”
in his heart before their introduction, aloud now
that they were so intimately acquainted.
“ And you know how I adore romance ! ”
“Do I ? I know how I adore you ! ”
Pretty Girl shrugged her shoulders. That was,
“of course’’ —man invariably adores lovely
woman. But she kindly permitted Campbell to
take her hand, and to brush her soft palm with
eager “butterfly ” lips.
“Pretty Girl, Pretty Girl! when will you
marry me ? ”
“ ‘ When pigs are swine, and monkeys chew
tobacco.’ Tommy, Tommy ! when will you cease
being ridiculous ? ”
“But you promised last week”
Pretty Girl sank back among her cushions with
an amused laugh, while she stared out to sea with
a pair of eyes that shamed the sapphire waves.
“Last week I hadn’t the honor of knowing
Felix.”
“’Twas Mr. Grey yesterday ! Aren’t you a bit
familiar ? Felix ! ”
“’Tis a poet’s name, Felix Grey ! ”
Campbell sneered.
“ I believe it terms itself a poet.”
Pretty Girl repeated her little silvery laugh.
“ Why, Tommy, I believe you’re jealous ! ”
They were alone on deck. Such passengers as
were not plying their knives and forks below
were groaning in their bunks, holding their
wretched heads as they called for “ Lemons ” (and
Death !). They were alone on deck, and Pretty
Girl’s hair was a crown of glory and her eyes were
two regal stars.
Campbell knelt at her feet in the sunshine, and
put his big hands on her muslin knees, while his
brown cheek crushed the roses on her curving
breast.
“ You’re right, Pretty Girl; I’m jealous !
jealous!”
They were alone on deck, and Pretty Girl’s face
showed like a rose against its background of rail
and turquoise sky. They were alone on deck, and
Campbell raised his head, till his lips were on a
level with her stem-like throat.
“Jealous! Does it hurt l" queried Pretty
Girl, haughtily.
His soul welled up into his eyes.
Pretty Girl laughed again and drew back, and
then Campbell, following the direction of her
gaze, saw Felix Grey stalk slowly up the staircase,
balancing between his thumb and lank fore-finger
the precious note-book, in which it was his wont
to jot down such chance inspirations as were
vouchsafed him during his promenade by Pretty
Girl’s side over the sunny, wind-swept deck.
• • * *
“If Violet Elliot is not engaged, she ought to
be ! ” was the opinion of the shipboard mothers,
and the shipboard daughters echoed their
mother’s opinions fortissimo, while the men sighed,
particularly Campbell.
For Pretty Girl never played bull or quoits
or sang in the music saloon now; never
ran races with the babies or peeped at the
passing ships through her admirers’ telescopes, or
knitted them wonderful and fearful ties, or
poured out morning tea in the captain’s cabin —
never, now.
Wet or fine, she was invariably shadowed by a
gaunt, black figure in a flapping cloak ; a gaunt,
black figure which resembled some gigantic sea
bird; a weird apparition that spread its wings
and wildly gesticulated, as it declaimed choice
portions from out the interminable American
leather note-book.
• * * *
It was some three days later, when Campbell
was smoking a quiet pipe in the moonlight, that
Pretty Girl came to him, across the shining deck,
in a loose white frock that trailed, with a misty
scarf swelling round her slender shoulders, and a
glimmer of moonstones in her hair.
She seated herself beside him in silence, while
he held his breath and gazed at her, and for a
time she seemed to be aware of nothing but the
magic scene before them, the shifting lights in sky
and water, the white foam track that spread like
a train over the rippling deep, the moon that
swam in the blue heavens, and the little waves-
that broke like restless hearts on the ship’s side.
Then suddenly, without any warning, she began to.
weep.
“Oh, Tommy, I’m so sick of poets and poetry,
of long-winded manuscripts and God-given inspira-
tions... So sick of him—you’ve no idea what a
bore—a fool— Felix is. This morning, when I was.
feeling dreadfully low and ill, he would insist on
dragging me to the side that I might admire the-
pearly tints of the horizon (as though I cared
whether there was a horizon at all!), and to-night
he was so absorbed in the rose flush of the sky
that he forgot to put on my cloak, though I was
cold and shivering. Oh, it is awful to see him,
mumble, mumble, mumble, and dream, dream,
morning, noon, and night. He forgets to comb-
ins hair, and yesterday his hands were posi-
tively unclean. And while he prates at such
length about the ideal, he totally forgets-
the real, who stands by his side and loves him—at
least, who loved him. He talks of the glories of
the sunsets, and does not observe the colors of my
gowns. Now, you always know ! You are always
worth dressing for, you dear boy. Shut your eyes-
and tell me what I have on, Tommy—quick ! ’
Tommy guessed, and obeyed.
“You are wearing a white frock that trails.
Pretty Girl, and there is a blue belt round your
pretty waist, and a fan to match dangling from
vour slender wrist. A thin scarf of woven mist
and moonbeams swells softly round your shoul-
ders, and a pendant of red stones burns and glows-
on your sweet, white breast, and there .are moon-
stones as well as moonbeams in your hair.”
There was not a soul in sight, but an ulstered
man who snored in a deck-chair, and did not
count, so Pretty Girl laid her head on Tommy’s
shoulder, and rubbed her cheek on his dark coat-
sleeve with the croon of a contented child.
“ Dear boy ! I knew I could trust him. Go on.’
“ There is a flush like roses in your cheeks, and
a light like Heaven in your eyes. Your lips are
like roses, too, Pretty Girl! ” )r
“You are smothering me—crushing my frills,
cried Pretty Girl, faintly. “Oh, Tommie, dar-
ling—stop ! ” .
But. naturallv enough. Campbell continued.
DOROTHY FRANCES McCRAE.


Pains in the Back
Aches and Chills. Gives Thanks to Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. A Medicine
which Does All that is Claimed for it.
j&r?
Mrs. A. Curtis, of 85 Charles
St., Northcote, Victoria, sends
us her photograph, and says:
“Having used Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla and proved it to be what
is claimed for it, I am in a posi-
tion to say that no better medi-
cine could be found for severe
pains in the back, for which 1
used it. I must have caught a
chill, as I was greatly troubled
with aching pains in the back.
I began to take Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla for it, and after a few weeks
I was a new woman. Am now
well, and in much better health
than I have been for a long time,
lor which I have to thank Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla.”
Tou may think sometimes that Ayer’s Sarsaparilla does too many things,
cures too many diseases. But f you will stop and reason a moment you will
see just why its power to cure is so great. It is because this medicine acts
so directly upon the blood. When the blood is impure, then the whole body
suffers. You feel weak and exhausted ; you are nervous and discouraged ;
you have aches and pains ; the head throbs and beats ; the skin breaks out
in rashes ; and even the kidneys may become seriously affected. All because
the blood is impure. Ayer’s Sarsaparilla simply purifies and enriches the
blood; and by doing this one thing it removes a multitude of complaints and
diseases.
"It was “Ayer’s” Sarsaparilla that made Sarsaparilla famous. Be sure to
get the original, genuine kind. Accept no substitutes.
