The Red Page
George Moore and W. B. Yeats
A reading of George Moore’s Ave, the
first part of a trilogy, entitled Hail and Fare-
well! (Heinemann), is rather disappointing :
hot George Moore is George Moore, and the
author of Esther Waters can claim" respect-
ful treatment. He is one of the surviving
great literary men of a dying generation,
but he survives, not in the dignified retire-
ment of Hardy, but rather like a shipwrecked
man on a raft shouting for help. He is cer-
tainly a great man; he tells us so himself.
The present work is interesting, apart
from the author’s finished style, for the
glimpses it affords us of the beginnings of
the Irish national drama, and the malicious
pictures of William B. Yeats. Moore’s con-
version to pro-Boerism has hardly any in-
terest to a continent that has long ago been
converted. However, his conversion is here
recorded for the benefit of his soul.
Probably with a smile, Moore tells how
Ireland lost her chance:—-
I remembered that Ireland had not been
seen for me for many years, and. to put the
smack of immortality upon it, it would be
necessary to live in Ireland, in a cabin in
the west; only in that way could I learn
the people, become intimate with them again.
The temptation had come, he recalls, to
learn Irish, one day when two Irishmen
were rowing him on Lough Carra. They
were anxious to teach him:—
A decisive day for Ireland, for if I had
learned the language from the boatmen (it
would have been easy to do so then) a book
might have been written about Carmody
and the tinker that would have set all
Europe talking; before the year was out a
translation would have appeared. The
novel dreamed by me, written in a new
language, or in a language revived, would
have been a great literary event, and the
Irish language would now be a flourishing
concern.
That day on Lough Carra its fate was
decided, unless, indeed, genius awakens in
one of the islanders off the coast, where only
Irish is spoken. If such a one were to write
a book about his island, he would rank above
all living writers, and he would be known
for evermore as the Irish Dante. But, the
possibility of genius, completely equipped,
arising in the Arran Islands seemed a little
remote. To quote that very trite, mutton-
chop-whiskered gentleman, Matthew Arnold,
not only the man is required, but the morhen:..
Now for Yeats. Moore took such a dis
like to Yeats’s attire —long black cloak, blac t
sombrero, voluminous black silk tie, and s
forth —that he at first refused to meet him
“and thereby lost two years of his wonder
ful company.” But a reading of his vers
led Moore eagerly to suggest a meeting
with the Irish poet. The rehearsals of Th
Countess Cathleen brought them together
again. The passages describing the muddlef
rehearsals of that play, and the part Yeat
took in still more muddling them, make
delightful, if malicious, “portrait of a famous
poet, seen, as it were, undressed. But more
mordant is his account of Yeats as Moore
found him staying at Lady Gregory’s place
at Coole. Moore came upon “a tall black
figure standing at the edge of the lake
wearing a cloak which fell in straight folds
to his knees, looking like a great umbrella
forgotten by some picnic party.”
On another visit to Coole:
I looked round, thinking that perhaps
life at Coole was arranged primarily to give
him an opportunity of writing poems. As
if she had read my thoughts, Lady Gregory
led me into the back drawing-room, and
showed me the table at which he wrote, and
I admired the clean pens, the fresh ink, and
the spotless blotter; these were her special
care every morning. I foresaw the strait
sofa lying across the room, valued in some
future time because the poet had reclined
upon it between his rimes My eyes
thanked Lady Gregory for her devotion to
literature. Instead of writing novels, she
had released the poet from the quern of
daily journalism.
Yeats entered. Lady Gregory was ap-
peased with the news that he had written
fi"' and a half lines that morning, and a
Pau ’6 that he would be back at six, and
would do a little more writing before din-
ner. As he went away he told me that he
might attain his maximum of nine lines that
evening, if he succeeded in finishing the
broken line....
As the moon is more interested in the
earth than in any other thing, there is al-
ways some woman more interested in a man’s
mind than in anything else, and is willing
to follow it sentence by sentence. A great
deal of Yeats’s work must come to Lady
Gregory in fragments—a line and a half,
two lines —and these she faithfully copies on
her typewriter, and even those that his ulti-
mate taste has rejected are treasured up,
and perhaps will some day appear in a
stately variorum edition.
On another occasion, we learn how seri-
ously these writers took their little selves.
The present scribe met Yeats at one of the
poet’s evenings in his London lodgings, and
the sycophancy of his court of long-haired
people of both sexes, and the purrings with
which he took their adoration, would have
disgusted a pug-dog. He struck the present
writer as a simple-minded fellow, who posed
because it was so obviously expected of him.
On this other occasion, Moore remarks:—
Xeats was composing, Lady Gregory said;
we should have to wait for him; and we
waited, till, perforce, I had to ask for some-
thing to eat, and we sat down to a meal that
was at once breakfast and lunch. Yeats
still tarried, and it was whispered round the
table that he must have been overtaken by
some sudden inspiration, and at this thought
everyone was fluttered with care The
poet appeared, smiling and delightful, say-
ing that just as the clocks were striking
10 the metre had begun to beat, and aban-
doning himself to the emotion of the tune,
he had allowed his pen to run till it had
completed nearly eight and a half lines, and
the conversation turned on the embarrass-
ment his prose caused him, forcing him to
reconstruct his scenario. He would have
written his play in half the time if he had
begun writing it in verse.
Now we know how great poetry, and a
great fame, are built up. The recipe of a
large country house with a lake haunted by
20 swans, a kindly lady to feed you and
transcribe your eight and a half lines a day,
is herewith presented to the bards of Aus-
tralia. Won’t some kind Lady Gregory try
the experiment? An alphabetical list of
poets to choose from can be had at this office.
Tho Earth Soul
Taking the grandiose argument of the
German philosopher Fechner, that the uni-
verse is everywhere consciously alive, that
the earth is the body of a living entity, and
that the world-soul or cosmic consciousness
is something more than a picturesque dream
of the ancients, Algernon Blackwood has
made The Centaur (Macmillan) a book that
certainly will not be popular, but equally
certainly is well worth while.
Fechner’s idea, brilliantly expounded by
the late William James, in A Pluralistic
Universe, is that the globe, whereon we
perch like insects timidly peeping fr-un tiny
cells, might be the body of a gloriou i being
—“the mighty frame to which some im-
mense Collective Consciousness vaster than
that of men, and wholly different in kind,
might be attached.” As one of the charac-
ters in this extraordinary novel explains:—
.“I never realised before that the mere
size of our old planet could have hindered
the perception of so fair a vision, or that
her mere quantitative bulk have killed auto-
matically in the mind the possible idea of
her being in some sense living. A microbe,
endowed with our powers of consciousness,
might similarly deny life to the body of the
elephant on which it rode; or some wee
arguing atom, endowed with mind and
senses, persuade itself that the monster
upon whose flesh it dwelt were similarly a
‘heavenly body’ of dead, inert matter; the
bulk of the ‘world’ that carried them ob-
structing their perception of its life.”
As William James amplifies: “Fechner
likens our individual persons on the earth
to so many sense-organs of her soul, adding
to her perceptive life so long as our own life
lasts. She absorbs our perceptions, just as
they occur, into her larger sphere of know-
ledge. When one of us dies, it is as if an
eye of the world were closed, for all per-
ceptive contributions from that particular
quarter cease.”
Of course, the earth must not be regarded
as merely a sort of big human being—an
immensely magnified George Reid, for in-
stance. A planetary being would be totally
different in structure and in kind from any
other beings we know. It follows that the
human race is literally part of the earth,
projections of her immense life, and our
organs are her organs. “She is, as it were,
eye and ear over her whole extent—all that
we see and hear in separation she sees and
hears at once.”
Blackwood develops this idea by the im-
plication that there may have been projec-
tions of the earth’s great consciousness—
cosmic beings, and that some of them may
have survived. More, his hero meets one.
He is apparently a Russian, but Black-
wood lets us see, from the weird things that
happen, that this being is outside humanity,
a centaur. At times he seems to take the
shape of this half-human, half-horse, and even.
—a risky touch —the faint scent of horses is
not lacking. Of the psychological adventures
that the narrator has in the Caucasus Moun-
tains with the materialised centaur, of his
perception of Pan and the other mythologi-
cal gods, space does not permit the telling;
but the book is a fine example of a sus-
tained tour de force in regions where a
single false note would bring a dream world
crashing to ruins. For the reader of ideas
Blackwood can be confidently recommended.
There is no woman in the tale—not even a
mare.
The modern novel is not published to sell:
it is destined simply to fill the maw of the
circulating libraries. In London it has been
estimated that only 20 per cent, of the works
ot fiction and belles lettres are purchased by
the booksellers, the rest being bought up by
the libraries. Only one boob out of five
is offered to the individual for purchase.
“Jean Sibi”: We have it from “V.V.V.”
(“Red Page,” 19/10/11) .that Marcel
Schwob’s notes and documents on Francois
Villon will shortly be issued by a Parisian
publisher. Schwob’s notes, representing years
of patient research, were said t° have been
so written and arranged that they were ab-
solutely illegible to any person but himself.
Furthermore, it was alleged that he had be-
queathed no key to his mysterious writ-
ings, and that they would practically remain
heaps of valueles paper. However, it would
appear from “V.V.V.’s” statement that some-
one has at last deciphered these famous
notes, and thus rendered a service which
literary France cannot fail to applaud.
The Utter Uselessness of Critics
Grant Hervey, chiefly in capital letters,
shows that poets, arraigned in the Christ-
mas issue, are not so utterly useless as some
other people:—
Dear Brethren-Who-Sit-in-Judgment,—
Isn’t it high time that we had a little
Straight Talk About Critics? They have
lived on the dissection of other people’s re-
putations long enough, and should be com-
pelled to become self-supporting. There has
too long been the impression that the Critic
is a kind of superior being, full of conceit
and immaculate wisdom. But we cannot
overlook the fact that of late years there has
been a hideous slump in the importance of
the Critic-business. Half of our would-be
Critics"-are deservedly unemployed, and the
others —well, most of their pen-productions
simply make Us Prophets smile. The Critic
—unless he happens to be an Original
Thinker like Max Nordau, in which case he
is a Prophet and not properly a Critic at all
—is at best a parasite upon the intellectual
output of the Poet and Prose-Writer; and
in this modern world every man and woman
reads nowadays just exactly what he or
she pleases, without caring one jot for the
joint malediction of all the Posing Para-
sites under heaven. Consequently, the run
of f.a.q. Critics are oppressed with a sense
of dwindling self-importance, and general
organic decay. They look back through their
tears to a time —several hundred years ago
—when the Critic was some pumpkins in the
land ; and when a rude blast from —say —
the Edinburgh Review was sufficient to re-
duce the Minor Poet to tears. But the Poets
of this generation—in this Commonwealth,
at least —are of a hardier type. They recog-
nise that this is a universe of Parasites;
and hence they deduce that there is some
benevolent intention behind the provision
of Critics for Poets. And so there you are!
That Us Prophets do not groan after the
traditional manner, as established by Keats
and Company, is not the fault, of course,
of the Critics. They still turn out Criti-
cisms of much the same length, plus the same
old lack of understanding.
This slump in the Efficacy of Critics and
Criticism is simply a result of modern intel-
lectual conditions. As education spreads,
the number of people who insist upon Think-
ing for Themselves grows greater; conse-
quently, there is a steadily increasing dis-
respect for Critics. The Average Critic is
deficient in Personality, lacking in Indivi-
dual Force. If he were not, he would be a
Prophet—not. a Parasite; for the simple
reason that in this age of universal curi
osity every Prophet with even the rudiments
of a Personality can obtain a hearing. No':
all the Drab Critics and all the Academical
Sniffing on earth, let alone in Australia
can keep him back. And, dear Brethren-
Who-Sit-In-Judgment, it is the knowledge of
this Fact that lies upon your small suburban
chests like lead. You know that the game is
up—that Outback, say in Mulgaland, W.A.,
where YOU have never been: that arounc
the camp-fires the Song of the Prophet will
be read before the Leading Articles, before
the Criticisms—Before Everything; and
that, when the Criticisms and the Leading
Articles are thrown away, the Song of the
Prophet—it might be Lawson’s or Brady’s—
will be cut out, and conned again and yet
again, until its very central essence and
meaning has communicated its dynamic
thrust to some Good Australian’s heart. In
all lands, the aspirations, the passions and
spiritual emotions of the people become
electric in song. They flash out in rhythmic
potence from the Dynamo of Genius that
whirls in the Singer’s Brain. And then—
the Parasites Come After! The Shakes-
peares have their Bowdlerising commenta-
tors, the Burnses their apologists. It is the
penalty of Genius to be crawled over by
Critical Worms You understand?
Take away the written poetry of this Com-
monwealth —blot out the pages of Lawson
and O’Dowd, of Dyson and Brady, of
§uinn and Daley, of Paterson and
gilvie and Randolph Bedford —and you de-
stroy the records of this Young Nation’s
soul. For THAT is the supreme value of
Indigenous Song: it provides a measure of
the peoples’ intellectual and ' spiritual pro-
gress, of its upward or downward thrust.
Measure the spirit of the verse that is being
written in Australia NOW —a spirit of
energy, of effort, of courage and understand-
ing—-measure that spirit against the spirit
of pessimism and devil-may-care recklessness
that inspired the songs and the singers of
10 or 15 years ago, and you have an exact
index of the steady and splendid growth of
Australia’s Soul. To me—an Australian
Prophet of the super-dynamic type—the fact
that no Critic, anywhere, to my knowledge,
has yet set forth that Essential Truth, is
the best proof of Critics’ and Criticisms’ Su-
preme Uselessness.
Of the Poets who were writing here in
Australia 10 years ago, a number who still
survive, in the purely physical sense, have
ceased to count. Banjo Paterson is an ex-
ample. “We respect”— i.e.. We Critics, not
We Australians respect—“ Banjo Paterson,
because he has repented.” When Critics,
whether in the Christmas “Red Page” or
elsewhere, begin to respect a Writer, it is
time_ to prepare that Writer’s epitaph. For
Banjo Paterson is spiritually dead. His
bygone works, like those of Ogilvie and
Adam Lindsay Gordon—their great fore-
runner —are of value simply as a part of the
nation s psychic record. They ser a as an
index of the kind of thought that formerly
saturated the mind of Young Australia. To-
day, the Younger Generation is thinking
about a Horse in connection with a Gun.
And the Gun comes first, with the Horse as
a mere appendage. The “repentance” of
Banjo Paterson means that, having got out
of his spiritual depth—having found the
stream of National Thought flowing deeper
and stronger—too strong for Him —he has
swum ashore and bt me Respectable. And
by becoming respectable in the eyes of Tame
Critics he pays the penalty of Spiritual Ex-
tinction in the eyes of Un-tame Australia.
No Prophet who is a master of his period will
ever become Respectable. He will flee from
the company of parsons, grocers, Tame
Critics and other Pillars of Respectability
as from the Devil. In fact, he would prefer
the Devil —because the D. has a Personality
and is an Individual, not a Parasite.
We want more “disreputable” Poet-
Prophets to batter down the joss of Respec-
tability, with Tame Critics’ skulls for can-
non-balls. To each of those Disreputable
Individuals, who, like myself, aspire to gal-
vanise the spirit of Australia, I would say
this : Beware <?f the Critics’ Approval! Be-
ware of Respectability. Don’t Conform.
Don’t Repent. BE YOURSELF.
Dear Brethren-Who-Sit-In-Judgment, you
are Utterly Useless for Most Purposes, but
when you recover from your Christmas indi-
gestion you may ponder this question: Who
has the spiritual ear of Young Australia,
You or US?
GRANT HERVEY.
H, G. Wells tells his story in a recen
T.P.’s Magazine. Mother the daughter oi
an inn-keeper, father the son of a lord’s heac
gardener, who afterwards kept a little shop
in a suburb of London, and made a little
money as a professional cricketer. The shop
was unsuccessful, and his mother, who had
been a lady’s maid, became, when Wells was
12 years old, housekeeper in a large country
house. Wells was destined to be a shop-
keeper, left school at 18 to be apprenticed
to a chemist, and, that proving unsatisfac-
tory, to a draper. Set to work and won vari-
ous grants and scholarships that enabled him
to study and take a degree in science at the
University of London. Taught biology for
several years, then became a journalist, be-
cause he was “always interested in writing
prose.” Began with short, scientific fan-
tasies, for which he was well paid. After
the publication of The Time Machine,
The War of the Worlds and The
Invisible Man, he was enabled to de-
vote himself, “with a certain sense of
security,” to purely literary work. Has got
tired of the fantastic-scientific style of story-
telling, also of his sociological works, which
he terms by-products of his intention to be-
come a novelist, “They have, I think, made
a sort of view-platform of the world for me.
I had to define what I stood upon or write of
life in a disconnected and inconsistent way.
.... I want and hope I may now write
novels, and onl„, novels, for some years.”
The military correspondent of the Times
(London) has published a number of
Essays and Criticisms (Constable, per Dy-
mock’s Library), which should, but pro-
bably won’t, be of interest to this unwar-
like continent. Some of these studies are
already out of date, but in “New Wars for
Old,” “Tendencies in the German Army,”
and ‘‘The Japanese Army,” he tells us very
disquieting news. For instance, speaking of
Japan’s army, he states: “The supreme ad-
vantage possessed by Japan as a military
power is that, thanks to national service,
her home territory is unassailable, not only
by any single enemy, but by any reasonable
or unreasonable combination of enemies.
Her navy is sufficiently formidable to deter
any Power, except England, from the idea
of attacking her in her home waters, and
her two fighting services in combination,
joined with her geographical position, assure
to her a predominant position in the Far
East. Nothing but the military regenera-
tion of China or the United States seems
likely to deprive her of this privileged posi-
tion —-and to talk to a Japanese of such pos-
sibilities only provokes a smile... Japan
is already twice as powerful as she was
when she challenged Russia in arms. She
intends to be thrice as powerful, and nothing
but an external cataclysm or some internal
convulsion of which there is yet no symp-
tom. or scarcely none, can prevent her from
becoming so. The weight of her numbers,
the excellence of her organisation, the ade-
quacy of her armament, the skill of her
staff, the science of her officers, and the
splendid spirit which animates the whole
nation, have no exact counterpart, whether
in the New World or the Old. Were these
mighty forces ever employed upon aggressive
warfare, Japan would shake Asia to her
foundations.”
You notice he does not mention Aus-
tralia.

ANTHONY HORDERNS’ SALE
Affords an opportunity of securing a selection of the best manufactures at
prices which in many cases are not likely to be so low again in view of the
greatly increased cost of production. The advance in wages, higher freights,
dearer fuel, and increased Federal Tariff must result in materially enhancing
the price of numerous household necessities.
In addition to over HALF A MILLION BIG BARGAINS offered at
ANTHONY HORDERNS*

QUARTERS OF A MILLION POUNDS’ WORTH OF THE WORLD’S

SANACINE prevents the wasting and tearing of the Tissues that occurs in violent colds;
clears away the congested phlegm, and speedily allays irritation and inflammation of the

FLAT-CHESTED WOMEN!
Misfortune may liave been your lot in so far as natural de-
velopment was concerned, but science has found a way to cor-
rect your deficiency. Even though you have never been full-
bosomed, and although you have been attenuated all your
life, if you suffer from no wasting disease your bosom can be
fully developed and your weight increased to normal.
It is the refreshing firmness and delightful fulness of the
feminine form that captivates, and the woman who is most
perfectly developed is the one who monopolises the endear-,
ments of the opposite sex. _ .
No woman need stay thin and undeveloped. Dr. Falnere s

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Peace: 1912
I saw, that still-remembered summer day,
Like resting gulls
Those quiet hulls
Of Quaker grey,
Asleep upon the bosom of our bay.
Like doves of peace upon our waves they dreamed,
And as a quiet benediction seemed
Their black smoke that upon our city streamed.
I saw their sailors, gentle, sleek, polite;
They flooded down
Upon our town—
A goodly sight,
Coming to White Australia clad in white!
Just charming children of the Orient,
On simple, sober jollity intent,
Clasping the hands of boy-scouts innocent.
I saw them, like white flags, upon our street,
Buying our maps—
A sign, perhaps,
Of childhood sweet.
Bluff sailor lads, so glad our girls to meet!
Although, maybe, a trifle squat and short,
No Wowsers we to mind a jack-tar’s sport—
A sailor has a wife in every port!
Their coming has the wide Pacific spanned ;
The crimson thread
Of treaties wed
Us hand to hand.
Our allies welcome are to all our land.
See, floating o’er those hulls of Quaker grey,
That bloodstain of a flag ! Banzai ! Hurray!
.... All this I saw one well-remembered day.

Cash.
The peace proposals of the Chinese revolutionary a;
make it clear that real and personal property will Li
respected.— Daily paper.
Bu’st is the dragon! All his horrid claws
Droop flabby weak. The pigtail is forsworn.
Fierce Chows, enlisted in a holy cause,
With freedom’s flags the atmosphere adorn;
The times are wild With revolution rash,
And fearful China trembles for her cash.
With numerous rifles and a lot of knives,
The Pagan triumph thunders on its way.
The Mandarins are shaking for their lives,
The Manchus to a thousand josses pray.
It seems the yellow world has done its dash,
Mostly for lack of some Imperial cash.
Ah Sin to splendid nationhood aspires ;
A huge republic, vast as Yankeeland
Lights up his dreams with crackers and blue fire.
And gives the raging battle to his hand.
All Asia grows a mass of curried hash,
Forlorn of law, peace, pigtails, mirth and cash.
Lo! to their council the wild patriots come,
Their frowning looks betoken awful deeds;
Unfurl the battle-flag and beat the drum,
No talk of rest until the tyrant bleeds!
The mailed arm is bared to bruise and gash ;
With empires falling, who shall save his cash?
Yet soft! They rise and prate of many things ;
They fix the astonished calendar aright;
But glory lifts her voice and wonder springs
Up like a biplane through the Fat man’s
fright;
The revolution does not use its lash
To trouble property or scatter cash.
Behold, the peace proposals hot and red!
The Emperor shall not be harmed at all.
He can have tea and rice and beef and bread,
And live within a palace proud and tall.
And what is more, these patriots rude and rash
Will still provide him with his yearly cash.
Princes and other persons of renown
May keep their titles if they like the things,
And all their property in bush and town
With all the rental value that it brings.
The revolution does not want to smash
Fat or his interest in land or cash.
Banners shall still be given all their due.
(What this may mean only Confucius knows ;
But clearly this throne-breaking warrior crew
Looks kindly cm each fatted thing that grows.)
Yes, banners when the merry cymbals clash,
Shall be accommodated with some cash.
Whatever anyone may chance to hold —
No matter how he got it —is his own ;
This raging revolution, hot and bold,
Aims but to turn one kid from off the throne;
But ill it were that it should bruise or bash
The country’s bulwark of the Fat man’s cash.
Let dragons bu’st, let all their horrid claws
Be pared and manicured to suit the time ;
Great is the work, and holy is the cause
That will not steep its soul in bitter crime,
That scorning Sosh and all its ways as trash,
Clings to the steadfast rock of solid cash.
Behold, the renovated China rise,
Purged of her stains and new-baptised in gore.
Observe the splendid purpose in her eyes,
And read the noble record o’er and o’er,
How the great Mongol made his warlike splash,
And still retained his interest in cash!
Now, shall proud capital arise and flee
From land-tax bigots and trust-breaking laws ;
A haven opens o’er the shining sea,
Where Fat shall find a champion for his cause ;
Let Refer ida roll and combines crash,
China shall guard the sacred name of cash!

PAT O’MAORI.
An Epitaph.
When I am dead restore me
To brown old Mother-Earth,
And plant a rose-bush o’er me,
If such a tomb I’m worth.
And let the storm-wind toss it,
And let it ramble wild ;
’Twill sing a fitting anthem
For brown Earth’s wayward child!
And, haply, Youth and Beauty,
Lured by its minstrelsy,
May stay to pluck a blossom
Out of the heart o’ me.
Their thoughts blown hither, thither,
Will thrill me where I lie,
And if they praise ’twill flourish,
And if they censure, die!

It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
tlie,,proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1912.
THE IMPORTING BOOM BEGINS TO
FADE.
At the recent Labor Conference it was sug-
gested that “Effective Protection” gliould be
made a plifnk of the party’s platform, but
the proposal was turned, down, and it was
decided to stick hard and fast, as heretofore,
to the “New Protection” idea. A section
of the party never seems able - to quite
shake off its old tendency to be intensely
polite to the importer. Nor can it quite break
away from the theory of the Tory daily rag,
that somehow the Australian manufacturer
■ —who generally pays fair wages to Aus-
tralian unionists —is an enemy, while the
blatant Tory, who brings in the goods made
in an English or Chinese factory, at half or
less than half Australian rates, is a very
good friend. So the party believes, accord-
ing to the New Protection theory, in post-
poning any general increase of duties until
the Commonwealth acquires pow T er to couple
with the increase an advance in wages. Mean-
while, it believes in' ' granting increased
wages when the opportunity serves, without
waiting for the New Protection, and, in
doing this, it seldom asks whether it is pos-
sible, at these wages, to compete with the
sweated foreign goods which climb so gaily
over the one-rail fence ,of the tariff. In the
circumstances it is natural that imports—
largely the product of long-hour and low-
wage labor —should increase much faster
than local and fairly well-paid factory pro-
duction. It is also natural that the country
should begin to find its pocket growing light
with the struggle to pay for all these im-
ports.
Last year was a great time for the im-
porter—that consistent Tory and earnest be-
liever in low wages and a Black Australia,
of whose feelings the Labor party is so
strangely tender. The imports of merchan-
dise were valued at £04,869,243, which was
£6,176,842 more than during 1910. Some of
the more notable expansions were as fol-
low’s

Thus the biggest upheaval w y as, as might be
expected, in the products of Britain’s worst
paid, and most especially non-union indus-
try—-the industry that depends, to a great
extent, on the bony handmaiden who sang
the Song of the Shirt, and bade McGowen
and Holman and Hughes remember that
they were wearing, not ordinary clothes, but
human creatures’ lives. The shirt-maker
and her kind are not well paid in Australia,
but their wages are nearly three times the
British figure. As the duty on imported
goods doesn’t counterbalance this extra
charge on the Australian manufacturer, im-
ports are increasing heavily, and the Aus-
tralian Freetrade or semi-Freetrade Labor-
ite is becoming more and more a patron and
supporter of the sweater and the grinder
and the eater of human flesh and bones.
But, because the sweater lives in another
country, he professes that there is no guilt
on his soul. His principles have geographi-
cal limitations.
* * * *
Australia is a laud with a heavy foreign
indebtedness. It requires to export a great
deal more than it iniD'wts, so that the differ-
ence may cover the interest on its outside
liabilities. If, by reason of its craving for
cheap goods of dubious origin, it unduly in-
creases its imports, it begins to live on its
accumulated small change, and when its ac-
cumulated small change runs too low there
is a slump in local prosperity, and the wages
of the Australian unionist go down with
such a rush that he doesn’t know- what has
happened to him. The few figures which
follow show how Australia is preparing the
slump :
1910.
Imports (except gold) £58.682.401
Exports (except gold) .. . .. .. 69,855,873
Surplus (towards interest on public and pri-
vate Foreign Debt) £11,173,472
1911.
Imports (except gold)' £64,869,243
Exports (except gold) 67,423,395
Surplus (towards interest on public and pri-
vate Foreign Debt) .. .. .. .. £2,554,152
In neither case was the surplus on the sale
of goods large enough to pay the interest on
the public and private foreign debt which
this country accumulated so gaily in days
gone by, so there was a considerable export
of gold in addition. In 1910 the net export
of bullion and specie was only £3,303,327.
In 1911 it rose to £10,069,771. Also, there
is reason to believe that a very large amount
of the Australian gold, which was held bV 1,1
Australian banks in London —the accumu-
lation of years like 1910 —and lent out there
at interest, has been used up. At all events,
while the imports of cheap labor goods in-
crease, the visible stock of gold diminishes.
One big N.S.W. institution —-the Commer-
cial Banking Co. of Sydney—announces that
during the year its reserve of cash in Eng-
land and Australia declined by no less than
£1,705,000. It is a strong institution, and
can stand a much greater outflow without
turning a hair. Still, the fact suggests that
good Australian money is rushing out very
fast, to encourage extraneous sweaters, and
make big profits for importers.
This country can’t stand, with the reck-
lessness of a few years ago, wholesale ex-
portations of gold to make good the differ-
ence between the value of its exports on one
hand and the total of its imports and its
foreign interest bill on the other. Its
second great gold fever is obviously dying
out. Here are three sets of figures, showing
the ancient rise, the ancient fall, the recent
resurrection, and the present decline: —
Australian Gold Output.
The First Great Boom,.
1852 . £11,807,086 1857 ..£11,996,205
1853 .. 12.757,584 1858 .. 11,491,447
1854 .. 9,617,141 1859 .. 10,654,669
1855 .. 11,931,746 1860 .. 10,373,280
1-5 > .. 12,912,950
Then, in 1861, the output got down below
£10,000,000. In 1863 it got down below
£9,000,000. In 1864 it fell below £8,000,000.
After some fluctuations it dropped below
£7,000,000 in 187-3, and 10 years later it
fell definitely below £5,000,000. And less
than £5,000,000 per annum, divided among
a fairly large population in 1883, was a
very different ' thing from more than
twice the amount divided among a small
population in 1860. This represents the
next feature of the story:—
Australian Gold Output.
The Bottom of the First, Great Slump.
1583.. £4,580.523 1886.. £4,428,339
1884.. 4,826,810 1887.. 4.665,400
1985.. 4,626,069 1888.. 4,737,256
The slump was disguised by immense for-
eign borrowings, but it is impossible to bor-
row the same millions over again. So next
time it will be necessary to think out a
different expedient. Just when the foreign
borrowings had brought about the inevitable
burst, the gold production began to look up
again, and helped to save the situation. The
rise, based mostly on Westralia and its
Golden Mile, set in definitely in 1892. The
story is too long to tell )h detail, but a por-
tion of it is as follows \ J —
Australian Gold Output.
The Second Great Boom and the Beginning of the
Second Great Slump.
1898 .. ..£11,678.778 1905 ’.. *..£15,550,910
1899 .. .. 14,533,190 1906 .. .. 14,631.745
1990 .. .. 13,578,438 1907 .. .. 13.515.109
1901 .. .. 14,005,732 1908 .. .. 13,055,853
1902 .. .. 14,811,947 1999 .. .. 12,694,509
1903 .. .. 16,291,684 1910 .. .. 11,623,849
1994 .. .. 15,807,337 1911 .. .. 10,620,800
The inference is that Australia can’t stand
another year of gaudy trade razzle l.ke tiie
one just finished. For a number of years
it has been accumulating gold, and feeling
rich, and shoving up wages a little, and
rents and land prices a great deal, and pay-
ing very little attention to the need for
keeping its tariff well ahead of the upwmrd
movement in rents and wages and land prices.
It has bought more and still more British
cheap-labor goods, and clothed itself like a
king in shoddy and mungo, and boasted of
the inflation of its commerce. It has bor-
rowed considerably, and whooped things up
like a rocket. Now it has come to a point
where the exnort of gold and the using up
of the Australian gold accumulation in
London (the Commercial Banking Co. of
Sydney alone has £320,000 less cash in Lon-
don than it had a year ago) begin to exceed
the supply. The importing frenzy would
have to diminish even if the gold supply re-
mained stationary. But the gold supply
won’t remain stationary. There is hardly
one among the big mines of Australia that
isn’t clearly and distinctly on the down
grade, and unless the Port Augusta-Fort
Darwin railway is built in haste, to give the
gold deposits of the Northern Territory a
show, the probabilities are that the output
will, in a very few years, be back at the
£5,000.000 per annum mark. The decline
from the figure of 1903 is large enough to
make the community think hard. And it
must he remembered that the period of the
biggest gold output in Australian history
has also been a period of fairly good seasons
and high prices. The good seasons won’t
last for ever, and the high prices are already
sagging just a trifle, though the sag may he
only temporary. Moreover, the crazy policy
of the two most populous States, which re-
quires that all goods for export shall go to
Port Jackson or Port Phillip, and condemns
all that part of the country which is too
remote from,, these bloated ports for trade
purposes to ‘lie waste, is such a handicap
upon development that agricultural progress
is much slower than it should be.
Australian manufactures have expanded
very considerably during recent years. But
the wages paid have steadily increased (in
N.S.W. alone they were £1,300,000 more in
1910 than in 1909, and the increase repre-
sented about £4 per annum for each worker).
Rents'have gone up (those N.S.W. manufac-
turers who occupied rented premises paid
nearly twice as much in 1910 as in 1907).
New machinery must always be got if the
manufacturer is to keep pace with his rivals
(N.S.W. factory owners had nearly
£3,000,000 -more invested in plant and pro-
perty in 1910 than in 1907). And, as there
has been no corresponding increase in the
tariff, the manufacturer, though he has done
fairly well, hasn’t been aMe to do nearly
as well as the importer. Now, the course of
events has brought Australia up against
two alternatives. It may make more goods
for itself, which can be accomplished either
by raising duties, or by reducing wages
nearer to the hungry British level. Or it
may do with less goods. But, by one means
or another, it must shortly be content to
import less of the products of sweated labor
and less of the output of the bony Melba
who skirled the famous Melody of the Shirt.
It is only a question whether the reduction
will be brought about by the increased pros-
perity of local manufactures, consequent
on an improved tariff, or by the increased
poverty of the community under an unim-
proved tariff.
UNIFICATION, RECONSTRUCTION AND
RESURRECTION.
The Unification and Reconstruction of Aus-'
tralia is a patriotic ghost which refuses to
he laid. This time it is State- Minister
Beeby, of N.S.W., who is giving a lift to the
good cause, and naturally the usual roar of
anger arises from Joseph Cook, and the
usual liowf of great bitterness from State
Frightism in general. These and other mos-
quitoes of their kind have got a grip on the
hind wheel of the car of progress, and are
digging their feet in hard as they struggle to
hold it back ; but the car doesn’t even seem to
know that they are there. The Unification
and Reconstruction idea offers a remedy for
so many ills, as regards which no other re-
medy is offering, thatfit must win in the mere
ordinary course ofevents. The numerous
diverse railway gauges of Australia have
been, ever since the railways of the different
States first met, a hindrance to commerce
and defence, and a reason why the enraged
traveller was dragged from his bed in the
bleak and early morning at places that were
of no earthly use to him. The States appar-
ently can’Udecide on a uniform gauge, and if
they did they can’t decide how to allocate
the cost of making the change. All they can
do is to build every year a few hundred miles
more railway on three different gauges, and
make the trouble worse. The Commonwealth
lias power to take over the State debts, but
it and the States can’t agree on a basis for
the transfer. A great number of the Com-
monwealth’s best ports are kept closed by
State jealousies, and along each border a
great area of the Commonwealth’s good
country is kept desolate, to the loss of the
Commonwealth’s people- because each State
is afraid that the nexUone will get some of
“Our” trade. The industrial laws, the laws
dealing with monopolies, and other import-
ant matters are in a crippled and uncertain
condition through divided authority. The
Bank of the Commonwealth —the People’s
Bank —is threatened with opposition on the
part of infuriated State insects, and if the
opposition comes to pass the people are to be
charged with the money spent in the struggle
to ruin their own institution. There are too
many costly imported Governors, and the
States don’t seem to know how to get rid of
them. There are sundry Upper Houses
which have long been recognised as ancient
stumbling blocks. For lack of sufficient
Federal authority this country has just seen
the lamentable spectacle,of a Labor Govern-
ment appealing to Britain to interfere with
and diminish Australia’s self-governing
powers by annulling its old State Constitu-
tion. There are remote and neglected tail-
ends of over-bloated States—so remote that
the State capitals hardly know of their ex-
istence, and their neglect is the Common-
wealth’s loss. And there are many other in-
sects, oversights, annoyances, decayed tradi-
tions and mouldy ruins.
When the work of repair is left to the
States each separate repair—and the urgent
ones number at least a dozen—requires to be
done seven times by 14 Houses of Legisla-
ture before it is complete, and some of these
Houses seem likely to take 70 years before
they even make a beginning. At the best,
they are likely to do the repairs in seven
different ways, and thus create needless
diversity. Therefore the Unification and lie-
construction party proposes to have a
thorough spring cleaning instead of doing
one room, or one corner of a room, at a
time —to get a new garment instead of put-
ting 168 patches on the old one. Its pro-
position is that the people should, by a
popular vote, place all power, and all
assets and liabilities, and the whole
darned business for a certain time in
the hands of the Commonwealth. Then until
further notice there would be no State Legis-
latures, Upper Houses, imported State Gov-
ernors, separate debts, separate railway sys-
tems, separate educational systems, separate
Civil Services, State Constitutions, Federal
Constitution (for when the Commonwealth
possesses all power there is no need for a
Constitution to define what power it pos-
sesses) —in fact, for a time the country
would do without many things and live the
simple life. Next a great work of reorgani-
sation would set in. The debts and railways
would be retained by the Commonwealth in
a large general way without any impossible
attempt to adjust small discrepancies about
assets and liabilities. The Commonwealth
would retain all authority over industrial
legislation, trade and commerce and certain
other matters. It would divide up the
settled portion of the country into a number
of small States, attaching each to its natural
port, and endow them with a small handy
one-llouse Legislature and a local Lieuten-
ant-Governor apiece, and give them such
powers as the case seemed to call for. The
unsettled portions would probably be formed
into Territories arid put under direct Fed-
eral control until their increase of popula-
tion enabled them to rise to the dignity of
Statehood. And amid the general cleaning
up a new civil and criminal code might per-
haps be evolved. The State Legislatures
might alter this afterwards as they pleased,
but at least they would start fair, a,fter
throwing overboard a heap of antiquated
legal lumber.
This Unification and Reconstruction idea
—this idea of a great spring cleaning—is
based wholly on the will of the people. There
is no suggestion of a coup d'etat, or a usur-
pation, or a military revolt. It is simply
proposed to put it fully and clearly before
the people that it might be well to have a re-
adjustment of State boundaries —the old
boundaries having been fixed long ago, in
very different circumstances, by people who
had little knowledge of the lay of the
country ; that it might be well if, in certain
matters, the people decided to govern them-
selves through a Federal Government instead
of through six State Governments; and that
it might be well to have an overhaul of the
legislative machine, just as a steadier or
locomotive or even a bike is periodically
overhauled. If the people like the idea it
will be carried ; if they don’t like it things
will remain as they are. Against this the
State Frights politicians hold that the people
don’t really count, that they aren’t fit to
decide large questions of policy, and that
thev have only a right to decide how they
will govern themselves within certain limits
—-such limits as persons like Digby Den-
ham and John Murray and James
McGowen and Joseph Cook lay down.
Thus the impassioned Cook, of N.S.W., de-
nounces the idea of “giving Riverina away,”
being apparently under the idea that the
people of Riverina are an inferior crowd,
with no human rights ; that they belong to
Sydney whether they want to or not, just as
if they were so many cattle; and that if they
were given away to themselves it would be
the same as if they were transferred to Persia
or Hungary. The Unification and Recon-
struction crowd, inasmuch as it only'wants
the privilege of putting its proposals before
the people, is fighting the battle of popular
self-government against arrogant tyrants
who claim the privilege to give or withhold
or limit the people’s right of sdlf-govern-
ment. The fact that some of these’blatant
autocrats call themselves Laboriteg' and the
rest call themselves Liberals -deesb-t alter the
situation. The most intolerant bigot going
may call himself an advanced Democrat if
he has sufficient assurance. As a >case in
point, the slave-holding oligarchy of Poland
called its country a republic—of all things
in the world. ■ ; *•>
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The “S.M. Herald" on the Horrors of
Yassberra.
Now that the Tory press has, as it believes,,
got the Australian capital fairly anchored
on the hopeless Yassberra site, it makes,
very little disguise of the unfitness of the'
place or of its contempt for those who lent
a large credulous ear to its old-time lies on
the subject. Thus, on Tuesday of last week,
the S. M. llekald cheerfully reviled its won-
derful metropolis by implication in this
fashion: —
Does Mr. Holman imagine that the Governor-
General is only to reside in a bush capital, supposing
it ever gets to a habitable stage, and docs lie .sup-
pose that the representative of the Grown, is to
confine himself to such a residence? The thing is
unthinkable.
Yassberra, when it is finished, will be the
only allegedly civilised capital on earth that
stands neither on the sea nor on a reliable
river. It will ba the only one which has
been deliberately fixed by selecting, among
the available spots, the one with the poorest
rainfall and the worst prospects. It exhibits
the rare quality of having been chosen
by the simple process of rejecting the site
which was selected as the best by the re-
sponsible and highly-placed N.S.W. official
who was appointed to report on possible
locations, and by ignoring the places named
as second and third best. It represents a de-
liberate attempt by a gang of shoddy con-
spirators and disreputable traitors (1) to
provide this continent with a mean tenth-
rate metropolis that won’t overshadow
N. S. Wales’s State capital; (2) to pre-
vent that capital being indirectly the
means. of opening up a new port and
thus interfering with the wonderful con-
gestion policy; and (3) to secure its trade,
however small it might he, for the bloated
city of Sydney. These matters being fixed up.


the S. M. Herald now cheerfully expresses
its doubts whether the r<?tten place
helped to make Australia s political centre
will ever even “get to a habitable g ,
and declares that “such a residence, -
garded as the Governor-General s sole om
cial habitation in N.S.W., is “unthinkable.
In other words, it is good enough tor Aus-
tralia, but it isn’t good enough by a io g
way for the blessed Governor-General. i>j
the Herald’s own account the best thing
that Australia can do is to abandon lass-
berra, write off as a bad debt the small sums
already spent on it, and start everything
afresh. Th(? idea of having an Australian
capital which one of its cordial advocates
fears may never be habitable, and which it
is sure will never be fit for a Governor-
General, is too terrible.
A Good Certificate for the Territory.
This from the official report of W. S. Camp-
bell, who was appointed last year by the
Australian Government to make some in-
vestigations in the Northern Territory:—
The Territory possesses the great . advantage of
well-defined seasons, which is not the case in the
southern States of Australia, and this is an advan-
tage neither understood nor appreciated. The cer-
tainty that rain will fall within a well-defined period,
in abundance, to be succeeded most surely by a well-
defined dry period, enables the settler to make ar-
rangements accordingly. All the heaviest of farm
work can be performed during the mild season, and
the lighter during the summer.... There can be no
doubt about the climate and soil being suitable for
the growth of cotton, and, should an easy method
of harvesting the crop be discovered, cotton growing
will become a staple industry in the Northern Terri-
tory. I foilnd cotton bushes flourishing wild as far
south as the Flora River, producing excellent lint,
the bushes competing successfully with the indigen-
ous vegetation amongst which they were growing.
At two of' the old, abandoned mission stations, at the
Daly River, T found cotton luxuriating, although the
plants were burnt off year after year by bush fires ;
and in many quite unexpected places I have .found
cotton growing wild. Tobacco production, if the
industry is taken in hand, will, I feel certain, prove
of great importance to the Northern Territory, and
become a staple industry. Two or even more crops
of leaves can be produced annually from the same
plants. The tobacco season can be kept going
throughout the year, summer and winter. From my
examinations of very extensive areas of the Northern
Territory, I am satisfied that there are hundreds
of thousands of acres of land well suited for agri-
cultural purposes and for stock-raising, within a
reasonable distance of railway and water communica-
tion with Port Darwin. This land is simply a waste
at the present time—little or no stock, and no culti-
vation to be seen. Thousands and thousands of tons
of grass are wasting annually, at times when stock
in thousands in the other States may be dving of
Starvation or thirst. This, too, when fresh beef in
Darwin costs 6d. a lb., when the only butter obtain-
able is tinned stuff from the Southern States, costing
Is. Bd. a lb., when the milk is tinned milk at 9d. a
tin, and maize is 5s 9d. to 6s. 9d. a bushel. Upon
this waste land thousands of settlers could be located,
where huge quantities of stock and. exportable pro-
duce might be raised when markets are made avail-
able. In the earliest times of settlement the idea
originated and obtained that agricultural operations
Could only be performed by Orientals or black races,
and this erroneous idea has prevailed in and clung
with remarkable tenacity to the Territory, and, no
doubt, has operated as a disturbing factor towards
progress.
Still, W. .S. Campbell may not know as
much about it as one "Lancelot Victor
Wilkinson, who writes to the S. M.
Herald at the top of his voice to say that
“a white North is the dream of madmen.”
Anyhow, Campbell was only Director of
Agriculture for New South Wales, and
selected by the Commonwealth Government
for his expert knowledge. And what is
knowledge in these days of platitudes and
Wilkinsons?

Stage Unionism.
Nothing more grotesque, industrially speak-
ing,, has happened for years than last week's
upheaval in the Australian dramatic world.
A number of infrequently-employed and ill-
paid mummers banded themselves into a
Union, and affiliated with the Sydney Trades
Hall. Their action was understandable
enough to the average unbiassed member of
the public. It is such precariously-situated
wage-earners as these that need Unionism
most. The majority of stage-folk, who hap-
pened not to be “resting” for the moment,
immediately announced that they were
deeply shocked. By way of a counterblast
to the Actors’ Union, which demanded fairer
pay and hours in a profession which is
notoriously .sweated as regards its lower
ranks, the'less stone-broke mimes formed an
opposition Union (an “Association,” they
called it, to distinguish it from the other
concern), w T hose main objects were to keep
the Profesh. in a defenceless state, as of
yore, and proclaim to the world the flaming
lie, that everything in the stage garden is
lovely. At a meeting .which fiercely repudi-
ated the idea of introducing Unionism to
the dramatic profession, most of the local
“stars” spoke, and, as often as they did so,
demonstrated the calamitous effect which
the limelight has on frail human nature’s
sense of proportion. The fair and fortu-
nate Miss Florence Young, for example
(incomparably the most prosperous of the
lot), remarked ingenuously that she had been
21 years on the Australian stage, and had
been .in work all that time. She had never
yet had to fall bach on a Union! (Loud
and admiring cheers.) It was as though
Hall Caine or the discoverer of a paying
gold mine or Little Ticii or Frank
Wootton, jun., had smugly boasted of his
capacity to play a lone hand in the world’s
battle. Australia’s moderately-successful
pros, are a lamentably short-sighted crowd.
They are kind and generous folk mostly,
yet, being for the moment out of the reach
of want themselves, they cannot see, appar-
ently, that the lot of their less fortunate
brethren merits attention. They blither
about “loyalty” to their management, yet
they can’t appreciate the virtue of being
loyal to their humbler colleagues. They
can’t even see where their own interests
lie. With superb humorlessness, the
theatrical managers of Sydney, the day
after the birth of the Actors’ Association,
met and solemnly congratulated the mem-
bers on the steps they had taken to keep
the stage free from “vulgarising influences”
(meaning, not panto, gags and patter and
musical comedy obscenities, but Unionism).
It would have been a dashed sight more
honest and seemly had the managers frankly
thanked the Association for the real service
it threatens to render them, viz., that of
keeping down the salaries. None of the
“stars” who denounced Stage Unionism last
week have ever been paid in proportion to
the profits they have brought their exploit-
ers. Most of them are poor, after years of
hard work, well and faithfully done. They
would not be so, in all likelihood, had they
relied less in the past on “loyalty” to their
managements, and more on the “vulgarising
influences” of Unionism. It may be that
they are content: it is a dreary fact that
there are people who would rather be genteel
than solvent. But when they start agita-
ting to 1 force others to take their own Heeb-
like point of view, it is time somebody arose
and dealt them a good, hard knock.
, ■*- :
The story of an appeal unto (Lesar :
Sydney Sun last Saturday dug up a very ancient
and drunken story—that of Henderson Africanus, of
Melbourne. It was away tack in the days of 1878,
when the arrogant House of Landlords had brought
the whole business of Victoria to a standstill by re-
fusing to vote any money, because the Appropriation >
Bill included an item for payment of- members.' Mem-
bers had been paid for some years previously, but the
Council now put down its cloven hoof. Finally, the
Lower House passed a Bill providing for the Referen-
dum as a means of settling disputes between the two •
Chambers, and the Landlords tore it up. This was
the culmination of a 12 years’ battle, during which
three Appropriation Bills were rejected by the Coun-
cil; two Governors lost their jobs; 10 Ministries re-’
signed inside nine years ; an eleventh Ministry, that of
Fei, lowes, tried to get into existence, but was blocked
by the Governor’s refusal to even see the new minor-
ity Premier or recognise his existence; taxes had to
be illegally collected on the authority of the Assembly,
alone to prevent civilisation being turned off at the
meter ; a large portion of the civil service was
and the rest lived tergely on credit; the wages of the'
police fell nearly three months in arrear ; the Govern-,
ment was sued many times for unpaid bills.; and
Sheol reigned generally. Finally, Graham Berry
decided to go to England and ask the British Govern-
ment for a new Constitution. Then the Tory party
perpetrated its huge silly jest. It announced that it
would send a rival mission to England to urge the’
maintenance of the old order of things, and, with a
fine sense of the kind of ambassador whose cleanli-
ness and intelligence would fit in with its own char-
acter, it selected one Henderson, a huge and some-"
what deranged nigger, who sold newspapers .in the,
streets. The party bought him a bashed plug-hat
about a yard high, the worst-fitting black suit it 1
could find, .and'a brass chain, and gave him ss. a day
and a still dirtier nigger as secretary.' The wretched?
Henderson took his billet seriously, and for weeks be,
wandered around Melbourne, being bowed to by emi-t
nent Tories, having his leg pulled by Tory papers,;
and enjoying the assurance that. he would be ban- 1
quetted by the richest dullards in the land when lie'
departed in his ambassadorial capacity to encounter-
the royalty and' nobility of Britain. Strangers who’
visited Melbourne were almost paralysed at the in-)
anity of the joke, which ranked with the drunken'
mirthfulness of the stolen mace in later years. The
unhappy newspaper-seller nearly broke his heart whed
he was " bidden to return to his old job, and was told
that his glory was all a lie, perpetrated by)
the Tory dignitaries of Victoria on a black
tellow-creature of impaired intellect. Berry)
by the wav, despite all his eloquence and
his, personal influence, and despite the fact that!
12 years of political riot made a" fairly good.case, did
hot get his amended Constitution, ■ and was , assured
that under -no circumstances wpgld Britain intej-ferd
with the internal. politics of a self-governing State;
That should have been a warning, to John Verran, of
S.A., who made a similar application the other day’,
with no case worth speaking of to go upon, and was
ignominiously turned down.
In case the clamor about the high rents of
Sydney should lead to misconception, it is as
well to remind the community that rents are
comparative—like everything else. Thanks
to the congestion policy, the general pros-
perity, and the fact that Sydney tries to
house its population on a smaller area than
either Melbourne or Adelaide, combined with
the rapacity of landlords and the bowelless-
ness of speculators, rents have risen very
high and very fast. But if the Sydneyite
regards himself as a unique case and a
special object of commiseration, he is wrong.
He may even be said to be talking through
his hat. His case is bad, but there are
plenty which are a great deal worse. In
Freetrade Britain, the ordinary rent for a
single apartment, high up in a bad tenement
house in a bad locality, is 3s. a week. One
not so high up may run to 3s. 6d. or 45.,
though there is a reduction (perhaps back
to 3s. or even 2s. 6d.) in the cellar. On
that basis, a very poor four-roomed cottage
in a very poor street in Balmain or some
such place would be quite respectably cheap
at £1 a week. It has, in addition to its four
rooms (worth, on a London ground floor
estimate, about 16s. a week), its own front
door, its own (probably decayed) front gate,
its own (dilapidated) wash-house and sani-
tary conveniences* and some dim scrap or
semblance of a garden. The garden ma v be
only a semblance, but it is at least reser ; n d
exclusively for the family, except, of course,
for the occasional unlawful intrusion of
strange children, dogs, cats and fowls. Life
is not cheerful in these high-priced, low-
grade cottages, but the inhabitants have
cause to rejoice that their lot is not cast in
a big British city, where things are. a great
deal worse. Britain makes less fuss than
might be expected about its high rent pro-
blem ; it finds a simple remedy by shoving
plenty of people into one apartment. Bull
is a compressible person in a sense that the
Australian hasn’t yet attained to, and which
it is to be hoped he never will attain to.
Compressibility is not one of the major vir-
tues.
The Australian Journalists’ Association,
which was recently registered under the
Federal Arbitration Act, has come through
its first skirmish, and its banner is flying
high. On January 1, a new set of conditions
came into force on the city dailies, as the
result of a conference held at Melbourne
between a number of proprietors and re-
presentatives of the Association. But the
Perth Daily News remained cold and reti-
cent, and blithered all by itself in the
middle distance, so to speak. It became
essential to test the strength of the Liter-
ary Bricklayers’ Union, so on Saturday
last the A.j.A. men on the paper were
“called into conference,” which is another
way of saying that they dropped their tools.
The News managed to go to press that
day, but it heard the remarks of the Perth
Labor Federation, the Typographical Soci-
ety, the tramway employees (who distri-
bute supplies to agencies along the car-
lines), and the news agents themselves, to
say nothing of the stereotypers, machinists
and publishers. It didn’t like the sound of
these remarks, and on Monday it. held out
the hand of reconciliation. More important
still, the salary of reconciliation was in the
hbnd. It was a small episode, but it is
good to, win the first battle of the campaign
even if it is a small one. Moreover, even the
best general has to be content with winning
anv Find of old battle that comes to his
hand.
“Z 6”: The complaint of the N.S.W. Public
Service Board, that it cannot get enough
bright young fellows. to join the service
nowadays, .pained and surprised me. I’d
have thought that b. y. fellows would have
rushed the opportunity, and held it down
with both paws. All they have to do is
pay 10s., come out on top of a competitive
examination, and they get a start at £1
(one pound) a week. Then, providing the
bright young fellow passes a few more exam-
inations, and doesn’t take to drink, and a job
can be found for him, he will be earning, or,
rather, receiving, from £165 to £lBO in 11
(eleven) years. But the Board has decided
to go even further, and push the figure to the
giddy altitude of £2OO, which may. with
ordinary luck, be reached in about 15 (fif-
teen) years, so that, if a bright young fel-
low started in now, he would, that is, per-
haps he would, get nearly £4 (four pounds)
a week in 1927. Stap me, if I know what
b. y. fellows are coming to nowadays.

Senator Walker says he wants the Com-
monwealth Bank to start, just to show the
crowd that it is quite wrong in thinking
that there are big profits in banking nowa-
days. He points out that, in 1885, the Aus-
tralian banks aveiaged a 13J per cent, divi-
dend, and in 1888 13 per cent., but in 1910
they only averaged 7f per cent. What ex-
banker Walker doesn’t mention is that, in
1885-8 and thereabouts, most of the banks
were so dreadfully mismanaged that they
paid dividends which they were not earning
-—a few of them paid 10 per cent, or more
one week, and shut up in hopeless insol-
vency the next. Those big dividends were
thus paid by robbing the depositors and
other creditors. Before that smash there
were practically no preference shares; but'
in many cases depositors had to take prefer-
ence shares, carrying very low interest, or
chance getting nothing at all. There is a
big difference between tlie size of the bank
dividends of to-day and those of the boom
days ; but the banker who wants to get the
pliblic to think .well, of private bank man-
agement ought to be the last to draw atten-
tion to it.

Now that the avalanche has struck lousepii
Warp, people begin to talk again about . the
possibility of Maoriland joining the Austra-
lian Commonwealth. Ward was one of the
obstacles. He isn’t gone, but his mana
has departed. He has given Britain his
Dreadnought (at the public expense), and
collected his baronetcy (for his own sole
use and benefit)., He could_hardly have
done this either as Premier of a State of the
Commonwealth, or even as Prime Minister of
the Commonwealth (supposing he could have
climbed so high, which is very doubtful).
Now he has got about all he can expect, and,,
besides, he is pearly due to move off the
stage. There is no probable successor in
sight who is likely either to give Britain a
Dreadnought or get a baronetcy, aftd it is
doubtful if the Dominion is, any longer, in a
Dreadnought-giving mood. So a time is ap-
proaching when the question of union with
the Commonwealth can be discussed on its
merits, especially from the naval defence
standpoint. At present Maoriland, having
given a Dreadnought to Britain, instead of
entering into alliance with the Australian
fleet, depends on the British squadron on the
Chow station, and there are just three things
wrong with it: (11 It is very far off; (2)
it is very small; (3) it is not bound in any
way, despite the present of a Dreadnought,
to come within 2000 miles of Maoriland
■when that country most wants it.

Melbourne Argus, for ever lauding the
national spirit of Victoria’s “Liberal” Gov-
ernment,' alleges that an intended State en-
terprise is the importation of 4000 settlers
from South America, to take up land in the
local irrigation districts. Delegates from
these mysterious, would-be immigrants have
approached Minister McKenzie, and Mac.
is going to send an official representative to
interview the “skilled irrigators” on their
native soil, but “at the urgent request of the
delegates, he wishes for the present to with-
hold from publication the locality in which
they ro‘"de in South America.” All sorts
and conditions of people, from cannibals up
to blue-blocded hidalgos, can be introduced
into the Commonwealth from South America.
The veil of secrecy which sbrofids the nego-
tiations with the delegates aforesaid sug-
gests that there is something unpleasant to
hide ; moreover, the congratulatory tone of
the Argus is not reassuring.
Says Peake, the S. Aus. “Liberal” leader:
Bricks, timber, and firewood were to be supplied
to the general public. This was Socialistic legisla-
tion, and would establish a future menace to business
concerns. The Government had not to make a living
or pay rates, and hence could shut up any private
concern. The issue was with the public—-whether
the Government should be able to do this in the
future.
Naturally, therefore, being in a position to
supply cheap bricks and timber, the State
will hamper Private Enterprise abomin-
ably. When, for instance, a big mining
company wants bricks, it doesn’t either
make them itself or hamper itself by trying
to buy them cheap; it likes to pay the
highest price anvbody will sell bricks for.
The higher the price the cheaper, of course,
the building. And when a man is wonder-
ing whether he will build a house or a fac-
tory, the circumstance that lie can get tim-
ber cheap stops him at once. If only bricks
and timber were put up 20 per cent, he
might even build two factories and a whole
row of houses., This only shows how much
better it is for Private Enterprise to have
dear raw materials than cheap ones; also
it proves that the farmer is never so well off
as when wheat bags cost him a lot ,of
money; and Peake knows that when he
paid 2s. a lb. for leather he could make
saddles for much less than when he could
get the stuff for Is.

A three-line par., last week, made known
that “the civic authorities of Sydney intend
to enforce the by-law, so as to prevent people
throwing newspapers about the street.” It
suggests the lamentable casualness which
nullifies so many good intentions. Sydney
has a good, solid, reliable-looking regulation
to prevent thousands of newspapers being -
scattered about the highway, but some muni-
cipal blighter or blighters have taken it upon
themselves to suspend it, and, there being no
law to fine these blighters £lOO each for not
enforcing the law, they have done this sort of
thing with impunity. In like manner
N.S.W. has a comprehensive law for the set-
tlement of industrial troubles by arbitration, ,
but, as the Government has made it clear ;
that its own political supporters may
scoff with impunity at the awards of :
the Court, arbitration is really off.
And the compulsory military training ‘
business is at least partly off, a re- ’
markable Federal Attorney-General having
hung up a section of the people’s statute-.,
some time ago, on his own responsibility. ’
There is just one weak point about the com-
mon or garden statute. It says that the
breaker of it is liable to be hanged or fined
55., or something. But it ought to say how
much (as a minimum') the authority who
neglects to enforce .it shall be fined, and
specify that he may be: proceeded against by
any citizen whose rates and taxes have been
paid up to date, and who has never been
convicted of crime, the said citizen to get
half the penalty. If that feature was in-
cluded there might not be quite so many
laws, for a lot of ancient, derelict statutes
would be hastily repealed, but they would
certainly be much better enforced.
Your true-blue .“Liberal” is a wildly unreli-
able person at all times, but lately he (and
she) has been becoming more incoherent
than ever. A few nights ago, Calamity
Wade, speaking at Goulburn (N.S.W.),
said in regard to Speaker Willis. —
“To their disgrace, the Government have stooped
to be at the mercy of a blackleg.” (Loud ap-
plause.)
A Woman’s Voice: “You oughtn’t to have black-
legs in your party, Mr. Wade.”
Mr. Wade: “I agree with you. He will not
be there again, and, if we had known these things--’
before, he would not have been then.”
From that it would seem to the ordinary
intelligence that the party of which Wade ,
is such a shining glow-worm is composed of
unfaltering unionists, and loathes the black-
leg with all its great and bounding soul. Yet
things are not what they seem. For we
find the “Liberal” Wimmen’s , Conference,
sitting at Hobart a few days later, applaud-
ing the view of several Of thef representa-
tive delegates bn the subject of unionism v. t
blacklegism, thusly : f ;
The aim of Labor, by its preference to unionists,
was to force “Liberals” to become members of unions.
Employers should pay non-unionists higher wages
than unionists, for, in that way, she (the speaker)

Yet there isn’t a word of protest from the
Work or Reflection.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In regard to a proposal to have elective Ministries
added to the fighting platform, Senator McGregor
said the principle was already recognised as far as
Labor organisations were concerned. The motion was
lost.— Report of Hobart Labor Conference.
Now, I always have preserved a certain atti-
tude
Quite definite in reference to Work -
(’Tis futility concealing
That I have the Weary Feeling
And tendency perennial to shirk)
Still, I always strive to recognise the prin-
ciple
That earnest, steady toil is ever best;
So that, having recognised it,
Not to say idealised it,
I would fain lay down my pen and take a
rest.
For, you understand, to recognise a principle
Is patently a virtue in itself.
After that you have the option,
Of its strenuous adoption,
Or the placing of it gently on a shelf.
For myself, I’m forced to own that though
my theory’s
A thing of beauty, even in the rough,
Dearth of cash supplies good reasons,
With the passing. of the seasons,
That this simple recognition’s not
enough.
For it’s Work — Toil- — Graft—
It’s accomplishment that matters in the
end;
And the act of recognition,
Even by a politician,
Has not ever yet been known to make or
mend.
And the man who holds a lamp-post up with-
out much fret or fuss,
He may “recognise a principle” and feel
quite virtuous.
We - have read about the lives, in ancient his-
tory,
Of the. Doers back in ev’ry age and clime ;
Add' their method of reforming
Was reflecting and performing,
More especially the latter, every time.
But the man who sat and recognised the
principles,
And calmly left accomplishment to Fate,
May have won a reputation,
As a saviQur of the nation,
But his name has been suppressed, at any
rate.
This has clearly been the rule since far
antiquity :
Before a thing is done a man must act;
And all progress lay in knowing
What to do, and straightway going
And just working till reform became a
fact.
But to stand on distant nodding terms with
principle
Has been a most unprofitable trick.
You may scan historic pages.
And right down throughout the ages
Mere reflection never laid a single brick.
For it’s Graft—Toil—Work,
It’s performance that is needed in the
land.
Recognition, by the student,
Of the principle is prudent,
But it never yet has shifted any sand.
And Hell is full of futile folk who scorned
the verb “to do,”
Who “recognised the principle” but failed to
see it through.
VICTORIA.

alleged farmers’ friends in the daily papers;
on the contrary, at every suggestion of
starting bag-manufacture in Australia
there is. a howl of complaint, nominally in
the interests of the farmers, but really to
serve the purpose of the importers who rook
them. The United States, Canada and Ar-
gentina all manufacture bags from imported
cloth, and we might do the same for a start,
beginning with the more easily handled
bran bags, and working up to the larger
plants required in the corn-sack industry.
The week’s racing horror: —
A seridhs accident occurred at Marengo races on
Friday. George Brown, who was riding Billy Boy
in the hack race, was leading, when his horse seemed
to falter, and John Arps, who was riding Masher
close behind, came down, the horse falling on Brown
and crushing him.
Warline, running third, jumped the two fallen
horses and riders, and it is surmised one of his hoofs
struck Brown’s head, smashing his skull. He lin-
gered for a short time and died.
Apps is in a critical condition. Masher died as a
result of the injuries. Brown leaves a family of
eight children. Apps is single.
As a mark of respect the meeting was adjourned
unfinished. The sum of £2O was collected on the
ground for Brown’s family.
And still Wowserdom preserves a dead
silence in regard to the need for a cam-
paign against the brutal sport or gamble of
kings.
Concerning a storm in a shaving-mug :*—
There is a sort of musical comedy strike raging
in the Melbourne hairdressing trade. It originated
mainly through the sloppiness of John Weary in re-
fusing to gazette, and thereby legalise, the determina-
tion's <ff the Hairdressers’ Wages Board. The Board
hoisted wages in general, and, in particular, it
fixed the stipends of chairhands at £3 and their
hours at 48 per week, the closing hour being fixed
at 7 p.m. on four week days, 10 p.m. on Friday and
1 p.m. on Saturday. This determination was agreed
to' by the unions of both employers and employees-;
by the former on condition that the latter assisted
it in enforcing increased charges on the public. Im-
mediately then a new union of a section of em-
ployers arose, which objected to the determination
and asked how it was going to mow and reap the
workingman’s crop if it had to close its shops at all
the times when he was at liberty to get harvested
as aforesaid. Weary hearkened to the cry of this
new ass., and postponed gazetting the findings until
a new board had reviewed them, the old one having
expired by the imperishable hand of Time. The
employees promptly gave notice that unless their
wages were paid and hours kept as per the deter-
mination from the 14th inst., they would cease work.
They kept their word. As matters now stand, all
the city employers but one are keeping the award,
while most of those in the suburbs are doing so, only
about 40 employees in all being “out.” The em-
ployees are asking for the Wages Board’s award and
no more ; the objecting employers agree to give the
wages, but wish to keep open till 8 p.m. on ordinary
week nights and 2 p.m. on Saturdays, and at an
abortive conference they reduced their week-day
closing-time limit to 7.30 p.m. It doesn’t seem
much to argue over, but, whether they ultimately
reach a compromise, or fight it out to a finish, their
opinion of John W. remains the same. Their unanimous
judgment on him is that he is a tragic muddler, who
deserves nothing less than to be shaved twice daily,
by a ’prentice hand, for a fortnight.
Disconcerting scrap from an interview
with one Watson, a director of the Bank of
N.Z., a recently-returned tripper:—
British investments in the United States are tak-
ing the form of the purchase of enormous estates by
the English nobility and gentry, who regard the
States as a safer place for investment than Eng-
land.
And only yesterday we were told that if we
would only behave like dear old England,
which didn’t go in for any of your wild
Labor legislation, capital would settle down
quite nicely.
Ezekiel Alexander Baker, a relic of the
old days when N.S.W. Parliamentarians
were unpaid, left this world last Sunday, at
the age of 89. He will be remembered as
one of the few members (and one of the very
few Ministers) who have been expelled from
N.S.W. Parliament on a charge of corrup-
tioh. Milburn Creek was the cause of his
downfall. He was fired out in 1881, on the
motion of Parkes, by a majority of 69, in
a House of 73. Two years later the ques-
tion was re-opened, and he was re-admitted
by a majority of two in a House of 44. But
though he secured re-election, he never again
cut a big figure in politics.
A scrap of belated “Woman’s Letter,”
from Katoomba (N.S.W.)
Lord Chelmsford opened a town hall at crowded
Katoomba last week. He made an effective speech
on architecture, and alluded to Athens, Rome and
Katoomba as patterns. Then he skilfully twisted a key
in a Yale lock, and discovered a vestibule lurking in
maiden modesty behind lots of fernery. Afterwards
he received many local residents with affability and
a vice-regal shake—-all done in 20 minutes, a grey
tweed suit and a straw “lid.” But however much
his Ex. failed in millinery, ‘the local Durbar was an
immense success from the point of view of the dress-
ing of the native princes. The populace—-the simple-
minded mountaineers—who stood round and cheered,
\yere nevertheless rather disappointed. The sonorous
baronial title of his Excellency suggested a coat of
chain mail at the least. A luncheon, culminating
in half a dozen toasts, gave everybody an opportunity
to prove that the district was advancing more swiftly
in architecture than in oratory, though Mayor Goyder
was a bright and notable exception in a somewhat
speechless group. Lady Chelmsford, who was pre-
sent, was rewarded with a posy for looking elegantly
benign-—-which is really not her fault. The vice-regal
party attended a concert in the evening, at which
Harold • Whittle played accompaniments with the
grace of a Grainger and the unobtrusiveness of a
poor relation.

“The Cingalee,” the more or less colored
musical comedy in which, when our
beards were blacker and our locks
somewhat less sparse than they are
to-day, Miss Margaret Thomas enrap-
tured Australian audiences, was revived
at Sydney Royal on Saturday night. The
blighting hand of time has done the work
little damage. It is still strong on the hum-
orous side, and the music, even though it
falls short somewhat of the standard insisted
upon by your chronic Wagnerian, remains
immeasurably ahead of that with which they
who go down to Manly Beach on ferry-
steamers are liable to be afflicted. W. R.
Coleman’s scenic effects are a feature of the
production. Gazing upon his harmonious
masses of color, one can almost smell the
unspeakable odors of spicy old Ceylon, and
hear the scoundrelly local traders screaming
the virtues of their mostly Brummagem wares
into the ears of ingenuous tourists, while the
dhobi itch lies in wait near the Cinnamon
Gardens and ten million microbes bask in the
sun-baked street outside the Grand Oriental
Hotel. It takes a genuine artist to produce
results like these.
* * * *
As regards the cast, Miss Sybil Arundale
(Nanoya) makes such a charming and tune-
ful little Cingalee as would almost tempt a
White Australian to forego the convictions
of a lifetime, and commit miscegenation.
Right here, however, the writer is able to
state, from personal experience, that there
are none in Ceylon like her, and probably
never were. She sings “My Cinnamon
Tree” like a dyed angel, and her gyrations
at the finish of “The Dance I’ll Lead Him”
represent the ultimate yells in the matter
of grace, abandon, etc. Miss Dorothy
Brunton is a complete success as Peggy
Sabine. This little Australian girl sings,
acts and dances as well as any of the im-
ported stars, and, so far as looks are con-
cerned, beats the majority of them hollow.
Miss Florence Young sings Lady Patricia
Vereker’s numbers in her customary finished
manner. A more hard-working Chambuddy
Ram than W. S. Percy it would be hard to
conceive. He is not the type of Asiatic who
sits inertly down and watches the legions
thunder past. If there is any thundering
or other uproar to be done, Percy
insists, firmly, on attending to it him-
self. Jack Cannot is another of the exu-
berantly-humorous school. His Ceylon High
Commissioner is one of the most diverting
officials imaginable. W. Talleur Andrews
sings the hero’s numbers exquisitely, and
Miss Vivian Talleur makes a hit in a pas
seul. The beautiful Bearde sisters stand out
amid a galaxy of show-girl beauty.

George Portus and Frank Talbot (one of
the Taits’ busy young men) have joined
energies and a few other things for the pur-
pose of adding to the tally of imported enter-
tainments. The first consignment will be
opened at Sydney Criterion on March 2, and
will be found to be Jansen, an American
conjurer, who will have no slouch of a job
to keep up to the magnificence of his news-
paper reputation. He will afterwards be led,
pushed or bumped through Australia —at
least, that small portion of it which is not
Sydney—and Maoriland. Twenty-two vau-
devillains will accompany him. Other big
attractions are threatened by the partner-
ship, not the least of which is Delilah Cis-
neros, and a supporting co. in June.
That very human person, “Dame Nature,”
leaves the Criterion on Friday, and her place
will be taken by a vampire. As the present
writer has never met a vampire, he has to
depend on outside sources for a description.
A human vampire is a dead sort of person—
generally female—who is partially alive. She
either keeps irregular hours in her coffin, or
there are two of her. Generally, she appears
in society as a beautiful young woman named,
possibly, Miss Smith. When she stays at
country mansions during the shooting sea-
son, she habitually goes about at night and
sucks the blood of some healthy young per-
son, who thereupon fades visibly, like Little
Eva. If Sherlock Holmes can trace the
matter to its sopnsev the grave of the vam-
pire is opened, and hen body is found in a
perfect state of preservation and floating in
blood. The coffin may nut be blood-tight, but
that doesn’t in the least alter the float. A
stake is then driven through the cadaver of
Ann Smith, and it utters a loud howl, throws
its arms and legs around promiscuously, and
ceases to vamp. It vanishes from the house
party, leaving all its luggage behind; also
abandoning its new spring hat and neglect-
ing to pay its maid’s wages. Sometimes it
has added to the insult by sucking the girl’s
blood and leaving her too weak for domestic
service. Whether the dead person leaves
the coffin to vamp, or whether the lady who
is at large is a duplicate, seems uncertain.
In the former case, it is a durned foolish
vampire that allows itself to be found at
home when the tomb and the 10 buckets of
blood are dug up.
The practice of “Whizzing the Whirl”
still proceeds furiously at the National
Amphitheatre. It is a great and uproari-

ous turn. The comedian who could provoke
but one of the blizzards of hilarity which
cause the Amphi. to shudder to its very
roots, what time the Whirl is being Whizzed
would be able to ask and immediately re-
ceive £lOOO per week anywhere. The How-
ard Brothers will continue to stagger
humanity b’y their thought : transference
feats till ‘further notice. Millie Doris re-
moves her shy and-=:4hrinking personality
elsewhere after Friday, so. those religious
folk who haven’t "yet had an opportunity to
be uplifted by her act are hereby counselled
to buck up and get a move on.
At West’s the attraction for the week is
“Cursed Gold,” which shows what a ruined
merchant can do when he feels fit. He
plots to get possession of his brother’s
money, and kills him in a duel. Then he
arranges for the murder and disposal of his
brother’s daughter; but two accomplices
spoil things and disagree, whereupon the
girl escapes and the murder is postponed
sine die, while the merchant is handed over
to the police. It sounds like the Adelphi,
but can be seen .any night at the Glaciarium.
On Saturday Little Willie will begin the
monotonous job of dying nightly at the
Adelphi, and will continue doing it until
further notice. “East Lynne” is due on
that night. Until then, “A Girl’s Tempta-
tion” will continue to moisten the hankies
of soft-hearted Adelphian^;

“Before Yorktown” headed the list of
winners at the Lyceum this week—a good
picture of a smoky incident in the War of
Independence, when the U.S. began to raise
its first crop of Colonels. “Nick Carter,”
the overworked detective, has been unravel-
ling the “White-Bed Mystery” ; the Duke of
Fife has been escaping in his nightshirt from
the wreck of the Delhi; and “Photography
from the Clouds” has been giving people a
loftier view of things. “The Miser’s Heart,”
“The Indian Flute ” and the “U.S.A. Navy
at Football” also ran.

Comedian Herbert Rule, who came to the
Tivoli last week, had not managed to get
the gallery to sing for him when the Re-
ligious Editor saw the show, but. he may
have succeeded by the time this gets into
print. The process of teaching an audience
to sing* appears to be very difficult. Perhaps
it is because the pupils have paid to witness
and hear a performance—not to give one.
Terry and Lambert, a smart pair of im-
personators, are the other newcomers. They
work well together, and their original turn
sparkles most of the time. Other box office
baits now dangling are Ike and Will Scott,
Pastor and Merle, Cakewalk Johnson and
Tom Dawson.
“The Village Priest” steps into the place
of “A Woman of No Importance,” at Syd-
ney Palace, on Saturday night. G. S.
Titheradge will again put on the immense
hat, and take up the watering can of the
Abbe Dubois; and, as there must be a vast
crowd of playgoers who want to see him in
one of his greatest parts, the Plimmer-Den-
iston management may be forced to pack its
audiences by hydraulic pressure.
“The Quaker Girl’s” melody continues to
appeal to crowded houses at Her Majesty’s
(Sydney), and, judging by appearances, the
Easter egg will be old enough to be addled
before the box office will call for any other
sort of girl.
At Adelaide Royal, Alfred Woods has
taken advantage of a farewell speech to go
for “the greatest theatrical combine in the
world,” through whose machinations he is
unable to get into any Melbourne or Sydney
theatre. The dreadful monster has, he says,
practically shut him, a son of the country, out
of the Commonwealth’s leading cities. Man-
ager Marcus has come back and opened the
Tivoli again with the Frantz family, Emer-
son and Baldwin, and other desirable turns.
The King’s announces itself as now run by
the Brennan Amphitheatre Co., but manager
Shepard stays on to direct things. Bert
Gilbert has been an attractive turn at this
house. The Empire has been showing
“The Fatal Wedding,”’ per film, with tin-
can and other noises behind-scene; it is now
starring some charming kinemacolored pic-
tures. Wondergraph specialises with a
baby’s beauty competition. The Eyrie
mixes some variety turns with its pictures,
and West’s has a strong circus turn in the
filmed drama of the “Daredevils.” In the
open, Skuthorp rides the untamed bucker
and the fiery bullock, with occasional after-
noon shows at the Exhibition Oval, where
also, in the gardens adjacent, the Dandies,
with their simple but ciever concerts, never
fail of an audience.

Peter Waverton, bachelor —young, wealthy
and not quite an ordinary member of his
class—came home one night to his flat in
Piccadilly, and caught his man-servant,
Pine, entertaining a cabman in his sitting-
room. The upshot of which incident was a
sudden development of altruism in the
hitherto unsociable Peter. He ordered his
conservative menial, Pine, to summon from
the street an unkempt tramp, and recall the
cabman (who had hastily retired), and treat
them as his guests at supper. These are the
four men-characters in Tladdon Chambers’s
comedy, “Passers-By,” staged at Melbourne
Royal, last Saturday. • The well-appointed
sitting-room of Mr. Waverton is its only
scene. Cabman “Nighty” is a philosophical
chatterbox, who sometimes talks aloud to
his ’orse, he says, and tells the weary quad-
ruped that the first duty of a State is to have
its children decently housed, fed and edu-
cated in order to improve the breed of
parents as the generations roll on. Samuel

Burns, the tramp, is a shockingly humorous
example of the State’s negligence. Burns
works not, neither will he wash. He exists
contentedly on what he picks up or gets
given to him. Incidentally, he prides him-
self on his hatred of discipline, and his nega-
tive method of self-support. A dull, but not
unkindly animal is Burns. Pine considers
him “hardly human”; civilisation, which
made a pampered menial of Pine, a perfect
gentleman of his master, and a patient
cabman of “Nighty” having done nothing for
the wastrel beyond giving him streets to
loaf jin, Thames Embankment benches to
doss upon, and policemen to scruff him occa-
sionally by the neck.

G-year-old boy in lodgings. Her mention ol
the boy is Peter’s first intimation that he,
also, is a parent. His step-sister,afte f
ing the governess.during 1 eter s a k ,
home, told him she was gone to sßuaaon
"abroad,” and .Intercepted the girl s two
letters to him. And now his step-sister
(Lady Hurley)—the typical Cat ot Con-
ventionality—has got him happily eng g
to her niece, Beatrice, a veritable peaii ot
Mayfair, a maiden in a million, an angel up
to date. The superbly primitive and senti-
mental Margaret, the divinely slangy lea-
trice, and the relentlessly censorious Cat
aforesaid, are the three women characters
in “Passers-By.” The eighth character is
pretty Peter, junior, the small centre-piece
of the plot, who speaks about a dozen words
in all. At the time when the child is first
introduced as a visitor to the home ol his
long-lost father, the impossible Burns,
shaven, shorn and clothed in Pine raiment,
is adopted as a servant of the household.
Little Peter cottons to the wastrel, because
he is a mere child in intellect. _ Therefore,
Burns, in the third act, being informed by
the superior Pine that • he is only a limpet
on the rock of domestic servitude, incapable
of getting any sort of move on him, leads his
little pal by the hand and escapes to a hay-
stack, some distance out pf London. 11ns,
by way of showing Mr. Pine and the others
that he didn’t wish to be shaved and ’air-
cutted, and made a new man of. the an-
nouncement of small Peter’s disappearance
breaks in upon the Cat’s discovery of Mar-
garet’s presence at the Piccadilly apart-
ments ; and, whereas the Cat flees with her
fur bristling, her piece remains to comfort
the spinster-mother, whilst the men ■ are
tracking Burns to his haystack. After which,
the incomparable Beatrice jauntily resigns
her claim to Peter- in favor of the noble-
hearted Margaret, and the snarling of the
old Cat is left to the audience’s imagination.
The least acceptable part of a charming
play is the tail-end piece, where Peter is sup-
posed to be jealously concerned about Mar-
garet’s fictitious fiance, Hgnry Robinson. As
though a real heroine of emotional comedy
could ever be engaged to a Henry Robinson.
Miss Hilda Spong presents a mostly-real
heroine, notwithstanding her excessively
liberal figure. The maternal instinct is in
her performance; the suggestion of sup-
pressed feeling is gracefully offered'; the pas-
sion of the moment shines in her effective
eyes. But her voice is so naturally sweet
that she should never try to make it un-
naturally sweet. The effect is not improved.
It is like painting the honey and gilding
refined molasses. Harcourt Beatty is a
bright, debonair Peter, rarely quite convinc-
ing, perhaps, for his mannerisms of speech
and gesture are artistically theatrical at
their best, and melodramatic at their worst,
but always in touch with the character.
Eardley Turner’s sudden illness has thrust
his part of the man-servant upon A. J. Pat-
rick, who plays it capably in a superficial
manner; Miss Temple is good as the cattish
step-sister; George Miller makes a rather
too clean and crisp cabby ; and the Tramp
brings Robert Whyte, jun. (late of the Swiss
Express Co.), into admiring notice as a
character actor. Whyte’s tWo make-ups are
free from any touch of caricature, and his
truthful impersonation of the moody degen-
erate is strengthened by his peevish, creaky
tones, reminding one of William Cromwell’s
old, familiar bleat. As a draw to the public
the play loses some of its strength through
the mis-casting of Miss Elise Clarens for the
idealised character of Beatrice. The mag-
nanimous young creature who “chucks” her
sweetheart is supposed to be fresh and un-
affected, but the jaunty style of Miss Clarens
is essentially artificial. For the rest, the
sitting-room and its outlook are well put on,
the orchestra plays its part admirably, and
the kiddie is a quaint little picture.

Melbourne’s sacred lamp of melodrama will
he supplied with two new wicks next Satur-
day. At the Princess’s, a lesson in “Driv-

drama for women, written by a woman. Some
day a deep-thinking management will venture
a Drama for Men, dealing with the Sins of
their Sex, and then there will be such a rush
of big hats to the early doors as never was.

At the King’s, the drama announced for
Saturday is “The Shamrock and the Rose,”
and the co. has put its best brogue into
active rehearsal. Meanwhile, the tears of
the congregation are earnestly desired for
“The World Against Her,” which oozes sad-
ness from every pore, and boldly challenges
comparison with “East Lynne.”
The panto, continues to be a pleasure at
Her Majesty’s (Melbourne). The two prin-
cipal flying girls seem to enjoy their extra-
ordinary proceedings, and the other scenic
effects are as before, plus a red pillar-box,
where Mrs. Sinbad posts the mangled re-
mains of the Emperor’s letters to the sub-
urban press.

Fred Poplar and Kitty Wager are a valu-
able addition to the Opera House bill. Pop-
lar, who has much of .the appearance and
force of the late Chas. Godfrey, is remem-
bered as a specialist in “drunk” impersona :
tions; also, he is a full-blooded humorist in
mock melodrama. Kitty Wager is a tall and
fetching serio-comic, with a nipping voice,
and songs that consist mainly of chorus, well
adapted to the gallery’s wants. Hallett and
several other people repeat themselves suc-
cessfully, and the rest cafi be dismissed with
a caution. ’
At the Melbourne Glaciarium, various dis-
tinguished portions of thus lovely old globe
are depicted in kinemacolor. On Saturday
an unusually bright subject; called “British
Coastal Towns,” illustrated Margate, Brigh-
ton. and other resorts where Bull loves to
loaf in his foreign clothes. Another film of
decorative importance was “Picturesque
Holland,” showing some . quaintly pretty
Dutch scenes, which neither the guide-book
mentions nor the tripper wots of. But the

most striking of Saturday’s batch was “A
Great Storm at Teneriffe,” exhibiting Ma
Nature in one of her ugliest moods.
The most stupendous figure on the sheet
at Melbourne Olympia, last Saturday, was a
burly burlesque of Cardinal de Rohan, the
hero of the tale of the diamond necklace,
which involved the fair name of Marie
Antoinette, and led to the spanking by the
public executioner of the last lady of the
royal house of Valois. _ The fact that she
contrived to bite certain officials amid the
after-excitement, and before they had fin-
ished branding her, was a redeeming feature
in the case. At Spencer’s, a clever adapta-
tion of “David Copperfield” is competing in
popularity with “Thrown to the Lions.”
“The Blue Bird” and “Peter Pan” are becoming
hardy annuals in London ; the latter had its eighth
run this Christmas. Pauline Chase is the Peter.
Nowadays Pauline looks almost matronly, but that
doesn’t worry the kiddies —any more than the very
un-bovish Tittell Brune worried them in Australia.
That lady, by the way, has just produced a new play
in England, “Dwellers in Glass Houses” ; and she
now spells her name with a fowl-roost where the in-
terval used to be.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“C; Ockney”: The fair sex seems to have an unfair
share of the plavbills in Sydney at the time of writ-
ing. In fact, the titles of the pieces at all the
theatres have to. do with the sex to which I have the
honor not to belong. The list includes “The Quaker
Girl,” “The Girl in the Train,” “A Girl’s Tempta-
tion,” “Dame Nature” (the first “Girl” of them all),
and “A Woman of No Importance.” “Everywoman,”
no doubt, will happen along- presently. Mere man
takes a back seat these days. Evidently he isn’t con-
sidered the “draw” that he was (say) in Shakspeare’s
time. Personally, being a bit tired of “Girl,” I’m
keeping away from the theatre till some manager has
the courage to stage “The Baker Bloke’,” “The Boy
on the Butcher’s Cart,” or “The Cove Who” Took the
Wrong Whisky.”
London’s second censor, appointed by the Lord
Chamberlain as “joint-reader of plays,” is the author
of a farce, produced a few years ago, which one critic
said “should knock a nail in the coffin of the cen-
sor.” “Dear Old Charlie” was written round a gen-
tleman who snent his time in intrigues with the
wives of his dearest friends. The author has now
become the keel and the bowsprit of the censor’s
coffin. Brookfield stated in a recent article in the
National Review, that the golden age of the Eng-
lish drama ceased in 1889, when “A Doll’s House”
was produced and the modern movement began. The
Lord Chamberlain, despite the presumption to the
contrary, must have a sense of humor.
H. H. Vincent, for years on the Australian stage,
turned up the other day in the London Daily Mail.
The Mail, noticing a revival of “Lady Windermere’s
Fan,” sorrowfully referred to the early players of the
piece who had “passed away,” and included Vincent
among the passengers. “I am delighted to inform
you,'” came the reply, “that I am in splendid form,
and enjoying to the full my retirement on the
heights overlooking this beautiful city of Bath.”
Another Maoriland girl has been weighed on the
grand operatic scale, and not found wanting. Three
years ago Adelaide Van Staveren, daughter of the
Bishop of Judea, in Wellington, packed up her con-
tralto voice and set off for Europe. The voice was
delivered to the best German and Italian authorities,
with good results. It was in the land of the brigand
and the ice-cream that the debut was made. Cable-
grams report a highly successful beginning, and the
daughter of the Bishop of Israel is on the high road
to success.
An “anonymous advertiser of Australia,” who made
a pile here, and spent £lOOO on newspaper advts.
booming the Commonwealth in England and the
U.S., said, among other things: “Every man in Aus-
tralia has a show.” The Bulletin has looked into the
matter closely, and, even after allowing for all the
picture entertainments, must describe this as a gross
exaggeration. It would be nearer the truth to say
that every second man in Australia has a show.
“The dance is supposed to be very expressive, but
if not told beforehand, few would know what it dis-
closes,” says a London critic of some recent “steep”
dancing from Russia. Still, judging by a photo-
graph, The Bulletin doeen’t see how the lady could
disclose much more.
‘’ Ste rgazer ’: Went to see a segment of The
World Against Her,” at Melbourne King’s the other
night, remembering it as a pet abomination of old
lang syne, when the Dampiers used to toss it to
the tearful gods in their Exhibition-street barn. To
my surprise and sorrow, X have to admit that it no
longer holds first place as the worst ever; it isn t
even the 10th or the 20th. Indeed, it is nowhere in
the long range of awfulness since the conv.ng of
Worst Women dramas and plays about Vampires
from Dalmatia. Its plot seems fair, its, language
bearable, its people almost human by contrast with
the melodramatic storms that have blown along in the
grievous interval.
“D.”: The Howards, the mystery-men now per-
forming at the National Amphitheatre, Sydney,
stoutly deny that there is any trickery in their magi-
cal performances. If this is so, they are wasting
their time, it seems to me, and would be more profit-
ably employed backing horses, or something like that.
However, I expect they will be content to go on
earning the comparatively paltry wage that the
modern music-hall pays, till further notice. Watch-
ing them the other night, I was* reminded of the
Abb6 Pregnani, the Italian astrologer, who was sent
to England by Louis to impress Charles 11., and, when
he had done it, help on the French cause at that
cheery monarch’s court. As long as Pregnani con-
fined himself to casting horoscopes and so forth, he
was an immense success. In an evil day, however, he
left the beaten track and embarked on strange ven-
tures. The result is told in one of Colbert de
Croissy’s letters to Lionne (April 1, 1669), and is
replete with unconscious humor. Says the French
diplomatist sadly, concerning his country’s tool;
“The king said to me, on arriving from Newmarket,
that the abbC’s prediction about the races there
were wrong in every single case; and that his errors
had caused great loss to the Duke of Monmouth’s ser-
vants, who had regulated their bets according to his
forecasts. Certain gain had been promised to them
all.” Lionne wrote from Paris (May 4, 1669), in
answer to the above: “As to Pregnani, since he has
been unable to gain ground with the king by his
astrologv and chemical tricks, it is not probable that
he can be of future use to us. Take {means to send
him back to France, where we can have him under
finger and thumb. To prevent him refusing to leave
England, affect to send him with a confidential mes-
sage to Versailles.” It is the fate of nearly every
magician who has taken himself seriously.
“N. Lobster”: Stephen Ewart, as artist Bertram, in
the fourth act of “Dame Nature,” strikes me merely
as a young man who has had three whiskies too many
on the previous night. He is supposed to have been
drinking heavily for some time—long enough, any-
how, to paint some bad pictures. Yet he arrives in a
very presentable state as to clothes, _ and irreproach-
able as to manners; also, his speech is clear and con-
cise, and he exhibits no shakiness whatever. He is
not at all repulsive—rather the reverse, in fact; con-
sequently, Lolette's act of self-sacrifice in dismissing
her faithful Jim Ridgeway to take over the ,iob of
straightening up Bertram, doesn’t appear to be any-
thing serious. To my mind, the finish of the play is
weakened by Bertram’s dreadful spruceness. If he
only dropped a flask, to show that he was full of the
worst intentions, the audience would be better able to
appreciate the size of Lolette’s life-job. In this way
Ewart could avoid painting his nose, red or otherwise
damaging his remarkably good looks in the cause of
Art. ’
Bernard Shaw has got into the London music-halls
at last, with his short play, “How He Lied to Her
Husband.” Pinero, Sutro and Henry Arthur Jones
were there already.
“Snell”: Gregan McMahon had a piquant exper-
ience when he announced to the students of his
dramatic academy that he intended doing a little set
of Australian plays. The whole school was suddenly
and unaccountably afflicted with cold feet. Some
students fell ill, others fled to the mountains, many
had appointments with dying relations. It became
apparent that the idea of appearing in the home-
brewed drama was obnoxious to tpe soaring soul of
the splendid young Australian actor. He would die
first. “What, me act in his play !!’ snorted a half-
baked Thespian, with magnificent disgust, when
offered a place in Dyson’s playlet. - “Why, I know
him l” And the outraged artist got down stairs with
dangerous precipitation. It recalls the cry of a young
Melbournian, when the news first went forth that
Melba was going to be a great singer. “Her a
singer! She can’t sing. Why, my sister went to
school with her!”
“Philm, D.D.”: It’s coming. The West people
recently decided to sandwich their picture shows in
Westralia with vaudeville. The Fullers, in Maon-
land, moved in the same direction some time ago.
Some of the main suburban shows in Sydney arc
running two or more variety turns; and the same
learned and circumstantial observation applies to
shows in Victorian and Queensland country towns.
I don’t believe that the cinematograph is on its last
whirl by a long way, but the ..-competition has be-
come so keen and widespread that, in my opinion,
the best of the houses will have to whip up novelties
in order to keep abreast of the procession. For
instance, if the programme of Spencer, at the Ly-
ceum, included a saraband or turkey trot by mem-
bers of the Wimmin’s Political League, in dove-grey
tights like Grace Palotta used to wear, what chance
would a show on the opposite corner have? Sir, on
my word as a fully-ordained curate, it wouldn t have
a gasp or even an outline.
A curious case at Moree (N.S.W.) sug-
gests that somebodv ought to be prosecuted
for something. An ex-hospital nurse swore
that in the performance of her duties she
contracted diphtheria from a patient, was
in bed for 10 days, and was treated by a
doctor, who gave her a hypodermic injection
of anti-toxin. Shortly after her recovery
she was discharged from the hospital on the
ground that she was not strong enough for
the work. She went to her home at Gunne-
dah, and meeting her brother at the sta-
tion, kissed him. Shortly # afterwards the
young man died from a virulent form of
diphtheria. A Gunnedah doctor deposed
that he had examined the young lady, and
found her suffering from the after-effects of
diphtheria, and that he had seen the mark
of a hypodermic injection on her side. The
doctor and the nurse of the hospital denied
that the girl had been ill, that the doctor
had given her any injection, or that she had
been laid up in bed. It was alleged that
on two of the nights when she said she was
ill she had attended “socials,” and tljat she
was discharged for other reasons than those
given. The Bench dismissed the case, and
left things in a mighty unsatisfactory state.
POVERTY POINT PROTESTS.

The Australian theatrical managers met last week
and denounced the idea of an Actors’ Union. They
applauded the formation of an Actors’ Association
of anti-Unionists as a result of which it was agreed
no vulgarising influences were likely to gam
ground. —News item.
To-day, upon our ultra-genteel stage,
An edifying type of youth’s the rage
Who drinks at Maxim’s with cocottes, and rags
The waiters, and embarks on howling jags.
Stout females madly scoot from wing to wing,
With skirts upraised, whereat the rafters ring
With hearty laughter, and the whole house begs
For further views of underclothes and legs.
Artists, imported at tremendous cost,
Gag about fair, frail dames who have been Lost
Through yielding to The Lodger’s subtle wiles.
(Jokes about lodgers always earn broad smiles.)
That ever-fascinating subject, Beer,
Is handled lightly. The spectators cheer
While “Stars” recount, in side-convulsing rhymes,
How some droll drunk fell prostrate fourteen

The Age, the other day, told of a lady, name un-
known, who, while bathing in the open at South
Melbourne, looked to see what was taking unpardon-
able liberties with her shapely legs, and discovered a
large shark tenderly stroking those exquisite limbs
with his tail.
I sing thy legs, O lovely miss,
Who happen to possess ’em!
The eager wavelets haste to kiss
Their comely curves, and sharks with bliss
Approach but to caress ’em.
The ballet girls, whose legs divine
Are quite their leading features,
Have never triumph had like thine.
They fetch the men, but from the brine
Thou draw’st the finny creatures.
The ravished eels pursue thy knee,
The sole’s another starter,
The cow-fish comes thy calves to see,
The ribbon-fish aspires to be
Thy ever-clinging garter.
Now managers will all compete
To get the record-beater —
The damsel fair who at her feet,
In fond subjection most complete,
Has had a true man-eater.

Melbourne’s City Council is a business-
like body, which grapples with public pro-
blems in a hefty manner. It is now trying
to rid the city of its hordes of rats by em-
ploying one rat-catcher, two assistants and
no less than six terriers. The same council
lately voted £25, and not a penny less, for
experiments in allaying the dust nuisance,
which causes far more than that amount of
damage.in one hot windy day. But the new
council chamber is a thing of beauty, the
extra retiring rooms are unexceptionable, and
the supplementary kitchen is a joy. to the
fat.
( . An Adelaide woman has been lined for
‘harboring” her own daughter. The girl
was 16, an escapee from a reformatory, and
a married woman! She got married at
an aunt’s house during her two months of
lreedom, and then the Law closed in upon her.
Counsel argued passionately that the escape
was prompt id by “the strongest instinct of
human nature,” and that the harboring was
merely motlier-love; but the Court unsym-
pathetically thought that the bride must be
put out of the bridegroom’s reach for the
present, and that the mother had better be
fined a trifle of 255., as a lesson. On
second thoughts, it lined the aunt too. This
is a cold world.
E. ,1. Brady’s book, “River Rovers,” has
received a useful boost from the S. Aus. Gov-
ernment. Since he made his Lone Plan»
motor-boat trip down the Murray, in 1908,
lie lias been on the rivei; with Parliamentary
Commissions and the like, and has been well
fed on the South Aus. view of the Murray
Question, which is the foolish one that navi-
gation shouldn’t be interfered with by irri-
gation. So the book, among other matter
that was not in the magazine serial, con-
tams 18 pages of red-hot special pleading.
The Central State promptly ordered 2000
copies—soo for England, one for each Fed-
eral Parliamentarian, one each for S.A.’s
200-odd country and suburban institutes,
and the rest to be dropped about on steamers
and wherever they may do most good.
“The Old Soldier”: Ramaciotti, Aus-
tralia s warrior-impresario, is careering
about Europe in quest of military lore. Ac-
cording to one of the dailies: —
• over to Italy, he manoeuvred for a fort-
night with the Italian army, then did staff work
tor a month in Rome, and when last heard from was
attached to; the Ist Bersaglieri. ... “Fairly hard
work,” he writes out to another Defence enthusiast,
but enjoyable and of extreme value.”
A question I would like quietly but very
firmly to ask is: What, in the name of
sanity, is the use of it all? Here is the know-
ledge-seeker’s _ own description of the be-
havior in action of the army he was learn-
ing from: —
•f. company just landed is prone behind a low
wail Officers and men are huddled together under
nre for the first time. The enemy is somewhere in
front, intangible, unseen. Bullets whistle overhead
--the wall the only protection from them. No orders
or, worse still, half-hearted ones from the inex-
perienced officers, who do not know what to do, and
whom no one thinks of obeying. The paramount
instinct behind that wall is self-preservation.
Clearly Ramaciotti has been wasting his
time in Italy, if he thought he was going
to learn soldiering there. Custozza, Adowa
and now Tripoli, prove the Italian army is
no school for soldiers.

What dull dogs these shrill “loyalists”
are! Colonel Ryrie, of the House of Reps.,
was the chief speaker at an alleged Protes-
tant; demonstration at Clontarf (Sydney! on
Anniversary Day. The motion he submitted
wound up with a whoop for tho
revolution” of 1688, and a promise to “resist
by all lawful means any attempt to subvert
the great principle of liberty,” which the
glorious revolution established. Then, hav-
ing whooped for a revolution, and under-
taken to fight to the last ditch in defence of
what the revolutionaries accomplished, Ryrie
proceeded to denounce rebels and disloyal-
ists, referred to Holman’s views expressed at
the time of the Boer war, and declared that
men who gave voice to such sentiments
Z Gl '% w*, fit *0 represent the people' of
in. b. Wales, who should be represented bv
men loyal to their country and their king.”
l oor dull old Ryrie’s speech would have been
a. good enough whoop if it had been on a
motion denouncing disloyalists and revolu-
tions and deploring the fact that awful
traitors and disloyalists kicked poor old
James 11. off the Throne; but in support of
a resolution approving of that outbreak it
was the joke of the year.
A CRICKET ENTHUSIAST.
"Go on-bowl! I don't — (hie)— care f‘ yer bloomin' googlies."
Australia seems to have an unrivalled
collection of lame ducks in the naval poultry
run called Farm Cove. The recent long and
painful waddle of the unseawofthy Prome-
theus to Port Darwin is still fresh in the
tiles, and now the Cambrian litis provided
another breakdown. The little cruiser
started off to Hobart last week, but it had
hardly warmed itself up before it had to
turn round and come back, the cause being
a severe pain in the stomach.of the engine.
It may not have been intended, but the
selection of the Drake to boss our flock of
blue water ducks is really an excellent jest.

“Bilbax” on Jack Johnson and Desde-
mona:—
<t Assuming that “Snorter” (B. 4/l/’l2) intends
negro and negress” to include colored folk gener-
ally, I beg to say that established fact directly con-
tradicts his assertion that “the white woman is less
averse to niggers than the white man is to ne-
gresses.”
Anyone who has lived where white and colored
peoples are m contact will bear me out in the asser-
tion that the normal white woman has an instinctive
aversion to mating with the colored man, and that
the noimal white man has little of such aversion to
the colored woman. His chief restraint is such pru-
dence as may be forced upon him by regard for liis
social and business interests. There is no such re-
straint on the _ white woman who mates with the
Chow or the nigger. In all but rare cases she has
11 and th e> personal attractiveness that per-
mittecr her to live in white company as “a necessary
evil ; or, thrown out of the sweater’s den, prema-
turely used-up, she is of no further use of any kind
to the white man, and must perforce starve in the

Of the few eligible white women who, having free-
dom of choice in the matter, prefer to mate with
colored men it may safely be asserted that they are
of abnormal type and rare occurrence. Evidence of
their lanty is best established by the tremendous
curs mShment expressed when such an instance oc
rn T t he xT e y idenc ? available goes to establish the fact
that Nature has entrusted the instinct for race-
preservation to the white woman. The white man
(save here and there an odd one, who is regarded as
a freak) knows little of this instinct. His philo-
sophy in the matter ia summed up in the ieer

In the U.S. slave days the' mulatto or quadroon
with a white father and a colored slave mother was
a slave; the mulatto or quadroon with a white
mother. and . a colored slave father was free. The
child . inherited the mother’s condition—not the
father s. Mulattoes and quadroons Were numerous
enough, but the proportion of them that was free
from birth was infinitesimal.
Taking samples of the floor of' the bay to

ment lately found that the floor was mostly

body wants to make Melbourne an inland
town, though in that case it isn’t clear why
it should keep dredging the channels from
the Heads inward. Meanwhile, there is
about a square mile of low-lying land be-
tween Kensington and the Yarra, intersected
by the Saltwater River, and now flooded
every winter, but which, if filled up to a
depth of six or eight feet, Would make ideal

If the charge brought against the male
halt ot a newly-imported English married
couple proves correct, he has done the Un-
utterably Accursed Thing. They were quite
young people and were engaged to toil at
Lingara (N.S.W.). The woman acquired
iheumatism in the feet, and the police theory
is that the husband, reckoning she was of no
further value as a domestic servant, burned
ui". • shows shameful, unutter-
able ignorance approaching to imbecility.
Any_ domestic servant is valuable these times
until she is dead, and even then she can be
stutted and sold to the museum as a speci-
men of an almost vanished race. To burn a
domestic is akin to kicking the Ark of the
Covenant, or throwing away the Koh-i-noor,
or melting down a priceless specimen of the
gold-workers art and selling it by dead
weight to a marine store. It is not only a
waste of priceless energy, but it is the act
ot a v-andal who has no. regard for things that •
are ? rare. The Carib, the housemaid and the
auk s egg are not to be trodden on lightly
these days. Yet, this is only a development
of yesterday, so to speak. So fast has the
world moved that this present writer can
remember when the domestic servant of Eng-
land definitely revolted against being flogged
by her employer. The defendant was,
almost as a matter of course, an Anglican
parson anything very remarkable of that
sort was always done by an Anglican par-
son—and he hung out in London. The event
happened in the late ’GO’s. In an apolo-
getic sort of way, the preacher’s general kit-
chen wench, aged about 18, haled him before
the police court on the ground that he had
soundly caned her four times during a period
of six months. 1 "
FALLING TIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is a matter for congratulation that the collapse
af the floor did not occur in the dav time, for had it
happened during working hours the clerical staff
certainly have been killed. The desks at
which they usually sit were reduced to splinters by
the falling tin. —News item.
The years go by in busted boots ;
The dog-eared ledgers swell ;
As all books do. (The clerkly coots
This strange fact know quite well.)
The pages stained with honest sweat
And dose-packed figures rise;
The record bloats—grows larger yet
Beneath their weary eyes.
The thick leaves flap like waving flags
When they are “calling back” ;
Each peering hour its slow length drags
Around Time’s eight-lap track.
And as the clerks grow old and shrink,
The open books of Fat
Seem on the desks to laugh and wink
Like his most radiant hat.
The watchful eyes that search with care
The volume of much tin
Grow weak. Then, like some insect rare,
The clerkly one's glassed-in.
A groundling moth, he cannot climb,
Or at his bondage chafe ;
Jlis books are gulped at closing time
By that green frog, the safe.
Arid until nine o’clock next day
lie is as free as air;
Then back he flies to earn his pay ;
The frog disgorges Care.
But once a week a packet small
Is thrust his palm within ;
For this he gives his time—his all!
This is his weekly “tin.”
It lies quite lightly in his hand;
His pockets do not bulge
As if they were chock-full of sand ;
The sum he won’t divulge.
But furtively he counts it o’er.
(To rattle it were rash)
Then straightway bows to earn once more
The same old pinch of cash.
But when he’s gone, that toiler meek,
Eight at the end of day,
The upper floor, grown old and weak,

From the Oldest Inhabitant: —
One of the very few bits of old Sydney left can be
seen in College-street, near the Grammar School. It
stands on the corner of Francis-street, and was built
by William Henry Moore. Moore, who arrived in
1814, was one of the first two free solicitors to
practise in Australia. Before their advent there
were a few birthstained Gents-one who had the ear
of such courts as then existed, and did what legal
work there was to be done. The pioneer clean-skins
came out with a salary of £3OO a year each —in-
creased afterwards —and with the right of private
practice. In the mid ’3o’s Mr. Moore lived at the
corner of George and King streets, on a leasehold
occupied in the early days by Captain Anthony Fenn
Kemp. The land, granted to Moore in 1823, con-
tained an area-of two roods four rods, the considera-
tion being a quit rent of 9d. per rod, with a pro-
vision for the commutation of the quit rent upon
payment of £63. The grant described the land as
“near the public pump.” In 1834—before he had
paid the £63—Moore cut up and sold the corner for
£10,318. The 25ft. 6in. frontage to George-street
brought £55 10s. per foot. Mr. Moore was acting-
Attorney-General on the resignation of Saxe Ban-
nister, who was concerned in a duel, and while in
that position he prosecuted for the Crown in the
“Fisher's Ghost” case (1826). After he left George-
street he went into the College-street house, and oc-
cupied it until his death in the late ’so’s. His
widow stayed on until the mid ’7o’s, and then
medical men became the tenants.
STILL ANOTHER OUTRAGE.
FEMALE VOTER: “Great Scot! Where will
it end? Socialism rampant in our midst,
our liberty threatened on every side, and
now a law against our only safeguard.
It's enough to make every girl flee the
country.”
RELAPSING INTO HIS NATURAL STATE.
BEAUTY (devotedly): “Shall I toast some more bread, dear?”
BEAST (quitenaturally): "Oh, don't bother, darling, unless it is intended for me."
One of Wade’s obedient boys in the
N.S.W. Assembly sees trouble ahead. The
other day a school
teacher, handling a
class of senior boys in
a western suburb,
asked them to nomi-
nate words they had
lately met and didn’t
understand, and he
would try to set them
right. One lad wanted
the strength of “mono-
poly.” The teacher
delved in and happened
to take the big Gas Co.
as an instance. Next
day Wade’s bright boy
—who happened to have
a youngster in the class
—called in to give that
teacher a gallon of
gruel. But the teacher,
instead of swallowing
it, suggested that they
should leave the ques-
tion to the class —the
M.L.A. and the Ped.
should each put liis
case, and the young-
sters, with no precon-
ceived ideas mostly,
should say who had
made good. It seemed
a soft snap for the pro-
fessional prattler; but,
as remarked above, the
politician sees trouble
ahead, and it was the
crushing vote given against him that did it.
* * * *
The great family of Snuffle is losing a
prolific opportunity just now to give itself
a round of advertisement. All it has to do
is get its eye on to the bran-bag gamble
that is going on in Sussex-street, Sydney.
What with short shipments from Calcutta of
the bagging, spec.-buying in Australia, and
extra demands from the country, prices are
soaring, and the betting square at Rand-
wick is small beer to the excitement. One
astute person wired to Melbourne for a
stack of bags, and before the vessel carrying
them reached Sydney, he had resold them to
a Melbourne sport at a profit of some hun-
dreds. The gamblers do not profess to
know where the business will end, but, on
the prospects, the cocky ought to find it
cheaper to forward his supplies by Glad-
stone bags.
It is cabled that our recent G.-G. Dudley
“doubts the wisdom of recruiting the senior
officers of the Australian Public Service from
those now entering as boys, who Will, conse-
quently be debarred from the advantages of
a University education.” Yes, indeed!
Many and many a time must the Australian
inspector of police have felt that he could
have caught the burglar in half the time if
he had only learned the irregular Greek
verbs; and if the manager of the State
brickworks knew Arabic, next wheat har-
vest would average 20 bushels for certain.
In the circumstances, what do they mean by
sending out a man like King-Hall to boss
the navy in these parts? What sort of an
admiral do they think he can be if he hasn’t
got the Oxford bleat or the Cambridge
drawl ?
Private Enterprise, which can always do
the thing better, raises a blast of protest
whenever it is proposed to hand the hospitals
over to the State bodily. Such a thing
would, it is said, lower the standard of the
institutions and poke a stick in the eye of
sweet Charity. So sweet Charity has been
permitted to run the business, and the busi-
ness has got into the habit of running itself.
Mostly the public doesn’t know much about
how the work is done : but in Westralia it
is part of the Auditor-General’s job to probe
the finances and the business management of
the heavily State-subsidised concerns, and,
with scarcely an exception, the results are
dreadful. Here are a few extracts from the
officer’s last report on “State of books, ac-
counts, etc.” —-
Midland Junction.—Unsatisfactory. Coolgardie.—
Unsatisfactory; no effective system of balancing the
ledger accounts in existence. Kalgoorlie.—Unsatis-
factory ; accuracy cannot be expected in the absence
of a system of balance; credits totalling £49 9s. 3d.
have been posted, for which no cash record can be
traced. Menzies.—Unsatisfactory. Southern Cross.
—Unsatisfactory; folios 153 and 154 are missing
from the ledger. Cue. —Unsatisfactory. Geraldton.
—Unsatisfactory. Northam.—Unsatisfactory ; atten-
tion has been previously drawn to the disgraceful
manner in which the accounts have been kept, but
apparently no action has been taken to remedv this
state of affairs; the audit could not be completed ;
the whole of the books should be thoroughly investi-
gated by the Department.
This, is the way sweet charity has got hospi-
tals into the habit of attending to their busi-
ness ; and there doesn’t seem any reason why
things should be worse in Westralia tliab in
other places. In fact, since there is a State
inspection in Westralia, and none at ali in
most other places, there is a reason for ex-
pecting things to be rather better there than
elsewhere.
“W.J.D.” : “Brass Button” (B. 21/12/T1)
drops a briny tear on discovering that a
battered old manure-ship, the Mataura, lying
in Wellington (M.L.) harbor, is all that is
left of the once smart clipper Dunfillan.
“Brass Button” might have dropped two
tears had he discovered the truth —that the
ex-Dunfillan’s bones have been lying at the
bottom of the Pacific since August 24, 1900.
The Mataura, recently at Wellington, was
formerly the Grthes, a fine 1183-ton clipper,
that took many a wool cargo from Sydney in
the ’7o’s and ’Bo’s.
* * * *
“Pub Servant”: After years of harrying
the N.S.W. Public Service Board has agreed
to allow the rank-and-filers to move up by an-
nual increments to the exalted income of
£2OO a year, instead of being bogged in the
wilderness of the pay-ledger at £l5O. Some
time ago the Board sought to quell the agi-
tation by raising the figure to £lBO by £l5
rises every second year, but this dodge didn’t
satisfy anybody, least of all those bodies that
were wanted to fill the gaps in the service.’
No doubt, it was for the sake of future effi-
ciency that the grade maximum was raised
to £2OO and some of the examinations
dropped. In these days a system which
can’t show anything better than £3 a week
after eight years’ toil is dreadfully liable to
find brains off the menu when it sits up to
breakfast. And the Ma State's system is a
whale for brains.
“Tibsen” : Re “O.K.’s” sermon on the lack
of reasoning in Suffragettes. Has the
gentleman with the jam-label name forgot-
ten so soon the case of Lionel Terry, who
shot a Maoriland Chinaman as a protest
against alien immigration? And what about
the shearer who, a couple of months ago,
tried earnestly to murder 500 people on the
Adelaide express because a staiionmaster
wouldn’t give him a free pass to a town a
few miles down the line? Neither of these
offenders was a Suffragette, or a woman, or
even a female.
One of the most active opponents of the
Actors’ Union in Sydney is Miss Florence
Young, and, largely through her efforts, a
meeting of actors and actresses was got
together under the chairmanship of George
Titheradge to protest that the union was
not a representative body. Miss Young ad-
dressed the meeting, and, before she had
spoken half a dozen lines, had put her high-
heeled foot right into it. Said the vasty lady :
“I have never been a day out of an engage-
ment for 21 years, and I think any Aus-
tralian with any talent has had his or her
chance, only one or two, and ; they have
brought it upon themselves that they have
not engagements at the present time.” (Loud
applause.) Miss Young, by no stretch of
the imagination, can be called a great
actress, and the fact that she has not been
out of work for 21 years is a striking proof
of what opportunities there are for medi-
ocrity. George Titheradge, in the chair, is
a very great actor, and he has been out of
an engagement till recently, for much
longer than any ope cares to think about,
with disastrous results to himself. It was
certainly the height of impudence on the
part of the large lady to invite,him to take
the chair and then tell him publicly that “he
had brought it upon himself.” ,The Actors’
Union has certainly, got some officials it
would be a lot better without, but every
new fighting union has to get food for can-
non to push into the forefront of the battle,
and naturally it chooses those who have
least to lose. On the other hand, the Actors
and Actresses’ Association has Miss Flor-
ence Young; and such a tactless person
could well be spared.
THE NEXT MOVE.
“Tips” given by the last Australian Eleven in Eng-
land amounted to £492 8s. Mr. Laver, manager of the
team, said: “It is impossible to go through a tour
without tipping rather extensively. We were neither
mean nor extravagant, but just did what was a fair
thing.”

“Etldyson” : Albert Park (Melb.) was lately
the haunt of a crank with some diverting delusions. He
was a moderately elderly sport, wholly disowned, and
entirely dispossessed of property, and he squatted in
the centre of the park, in the firm conviction that
he was perishing from thirst on the great, desolate
plains, 400 miles beyond the Absolute Ultimate.
A few people, whose upstair windows provided a
good view of the lost soul, carried him bread and
water after the third day. The hopeless stray ate
the bread and drank the water, but that did not
shatter his belief that he was lost in the desert, and
perishing for want of a drop of something liquid to
moisten his parched tongue. When the sufferer
started tearing off his clothes, and scattering them
to the 70 winds of Heaven, the respectable residents
with a good view from the upstair windows thought
it was carrying a fad a little too far, and, at their
invitation, police officers took the long-lost bushman
out of his sandy waste, and he was given the benefit
of seven days’ cool change. When liberated, the
lone man returned to his lost condition, and resumed
his terrible perish at the point where it had been
interrupted by the Law. Then the rains fell down.
The part of Albert Park chosen by the crank for
his death from thirst is subject to inundations, and,
when eventually the rains ceased tumbling, there was
a lake of three acres’ extent where the great, hot,
sandy plain should have been, and in the middle of
it, with his chin just above water, sat the lost trav-
eller. He had torn off his last stitch, and his clothes
were floating on the turbid flood. There, under a
sweltering and malignant sun, the shimmering sands
stretching round him far as eye could see, cut
off from human aid, 7000 miles from the nearest
habitation, he was slowly pegging out. A constable
waded in, and secured the sufferer and his clothes;
and very likely this is the long-lost traveller’s last
public appearance.
THE CHIEF ELEMENT.
LADY OF THE HOUSE: “ That is home made
beer. I made it myself. It’s absolutely
pure—nothing in it but malt and hops."
VISITOR: “An' water, mum?"
LADY: “Oh, yes! I forgot the water."
VISITOR: “No mum, you may have forgot the
malt and hops, but you didn’t ferget the
water."
“K”: “The Pariah” (B. 11/1/T2) in his
remarks re the failure of Premier Weary to snag
Curdie’s River (Vic.), is late for the ’bus. I have
just come back from Peterborough, and left a snag-
ging outfit, which has been at work for several
months. The snaggers are close to Timboon, and,
when they are through, there will be over 30 miles
of an excellent river-way. But God knows what will
be done with it. ' Except for a few tons of fruit,
there will be no traffic, unless the wood-cutters get
to work; and wood-cutting isn’t an industry—it’s a
funeral. Also, the entrance to the sea, described by
“The Pariah” as “narrow and deep,” isn’t desper-
ately deep. The mail drives across it every day, all
the year round; and a couple of years ago I walked
across it, and I’m not Moses.
A TENDER ALTER-
NATIVE.
BILL: "Come orn, let's be
friends. Tip us ver

JIM: “ Sham't."
“Paku”: The par. in this column (P>.
11/1/T2), alluding to the luminous growth on the
sides of and beneath old and decaying logs in the
Australian bush, is merely a reference to one of
many hundred species of fungi, several of which,
when dried, have a high commercial value. In Poly-
nesia, and also in the islands of the Western Pacific,
the natives gather, dry and sell fungus of one sort
and another to the traders at a remunerative price.
In Samoa the growth is known as aitu taliga —“the
Devil’s ear”- —by reason of its shape, which resembles
that of the human ear, the Samoans not being
aware that the Devil has long and pointed ears.
A considerable quantity of this stuff is exported to
Sydney from Savage Island (Niue), where the natives
call it palcu paku, which simply means “dry as dry
can be.” When alive, and growing in any quantity
in the jungle on a dark, starless night, it certainly
has a weird, uncanny appearance, and is calculated
to send the white man who sees it for the first time
flying to the nearest trader with his mouth full of a
wild clamor for sacramental and dispirited, refresh-
ment.
Dear Bulletin,- —I have just received
from Mr. James C. Cox, M.D., president of the
Australian Museum (Sydney), some interesting in-
formation which I would like to set out for the par-
ticular benefit of “Henry llorsecollar,” Hugh
Ward, and other well-known students of the occult.
Mr. Cox states that amongst the acquisitions to his
joint for the past year were a replica of Diprotodon
Australis, which has been placed in the Osteological
room, Decapoda and other Crustacea, and Polyzoa.
He has also snavelled or otherwise obtained some
treatises bearing on the well and favorably known
Riliqui® Diluvian®; the Amenemhats and Hyksos;
Lehrbuch der Protozoenkunde; Eine Darstellung der
Naturgeschichte der Protozoen mit besonderer Ber-
ucksichtigung der Parasitischen und Pathogenen For-
men. 11. Auflage der “Protozoen als Parasiten und
Krankheitserreger; Chemische Krystallographic;
Tabulae animalium invertebratorum, freshwater
Rhizopoda and Heliozoa, and other domestic fowls.
I merely mention this as a preliminary to the ques-
tion : Do these representatives of our common fauna
climb trees? —Yours as ever, The Ratcatcher’s
Daughter.
“Te Pana” (from Maoriland) : The Jew,
the Chow and the Arab are fairly good ac haggling
about the price Of anything; but for the genuine,
spectacular thing you want to see an Austrian sell
Kauri gum. There will be about 15 of him, and
half a ton of resin, which he dumps on the gum-shed
floor. The buyer boots the stuff about a bit, raises
a cloud of white dust, swallows some, curses a bit,
and offers £4 per cwt. But Spolinski isn’t taking
£4. He consults his fellows, in a language which
is a cross between a fog horn and 2s. worth of
crackers, and intimates that he couldn’t take less
than £5. Eighty shillings constitute the limit;
and there’s a lot more foghorn and fireworks. The
demand for a hundred bob is repeated. The buyer
replies that the crowd can take the gum to Gehenna.
Then Spolinski leaps 3ft. in the air, side-steps, goes
through the Morse signalling code, swears in bat-
tered English, Maori, Austrian and other languages,
counts his beads, and remarks upon the doubtful an-
cestry of all gum buyers. As a finale, he removes
his hat, jumps on it, spits in the air three times,
and, coming back to earth, says: “Dobra! I talc’
seventy-five.” The buyer hesitates, shuts his left
eye, and says “Done!”
The Norwegian whaling industry, to be
shortly established on the coast of north-west Aus-
tralia, ought to turn out well, for the Norwegians
know their business. The success —despite prelim-
inary disasters in the way of wrecks, etc. —of the
stations they have established at St Paul’s, the Cro-
zets, and other spots in the roaring ’4o’s, has been
very pronounced. The old fashion of harpooning
from boats is not now followed in the Northern seas.
Small steamers of from 70 to 90 tons, and capable
of steaming 12 knots, do the work with heavy
bomb-guns. In one day last year, a steamer, working
off the coast of Norway, struck and killed seven
of the animal that ate Jonah. The practice is to
buoy each whale after it is killed, and then follow
up the school, leaving a larger steamer to tow the
carcases on shore to the trying-out stations. For
many years past, humpbacks and finbacks have in-
creased enormously in numbers all round the Aus-
tralian coast, but the whaling spirit of the old days
has pretty well departed, although the shore whaling
parties on the Maoriland coast do very well. Nowa-
days, with steamers and improved appliances, it pays
the Norwegians to kill even the finbacks, although
the layer Of blubber is comparatively thin. The old-
time Yankee whalers never tackled finbacks. They
were not worth the trouble, and were hard to kill,
and cantankerous even in death.
*■*<**
The Condominium farce still jogs merrily
along in the New liebrides, and at the present time
three of its leading officials are enjoying a holiday
after their arduous labors. Some of them were nearly
drowned in the late lamented s.s. Tathra. The name
of the President, who is a Spaniard, makes one won-
der if he was chosen for his name alone—the Count
Bueno Esperanza. He can’t speak English, and all
that passes in the court (when a British subject is a
litigant) has to be translated into French. Still, he
is a decent sort of High Bloke. This Court at Vila
recalls the famous Samoan Land Commission ap-
pointed under the Berlin Treaty Act to settle some
hundreds of land disputes between white men and
Samoans. The personnel' of the Commission was as
follows: President, Judge Cedercrantz, a Swede,
specially imported. He could not speak any lan-
guage but his own and German, and was a staunch
pro-German. The British Commissioner was Bassett
Haggard, brother of Rider H. Why he was ap-
pointed no one ever knew, but it was surmised that,
as his brother knew a lot about Zulus, Bassett ought
to know a lot about Samoans and their land laws,
etc. He was noted for the gorgeousness of his dip-
lomatic uniform, which he wore on every possible
occasion, even when the semi-nude natives bathed in
perspiration. Ide, the U.S. representative, was ap-
parently chosen for a similar reason —his brother
having been a large nigger-owner in the Southern
States before the war. He was a genial man, and
was much respected on account of his three charming
daughters. The German Commissioner was pitch-
forked into his seat by reason of his having once
held a very subordinate billet in the German service
in the Cameroons. The Commission sat for three
years, and dissolved by force of its own inability .to
settle a few hundred petty land disputes which the
late Thurston, of Fiji, could have cleared off the
slate in a week. No one of the Commission when
appointed could speak a word of Samoan; perjury,
false interpretation by interested interpreters suborned
on all sides, and general all-round lying by the
Samoan litigants were the order of the day. But the
Commissioners were paid big salaries, and hung on
like leeches to their billets, till the white ant of time-
and circumstance ate the jobs from under them.
THE DRAY AND DRAUGHT-HORSE RACE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DRAUGHT-HORSE RACE, 4 furlongs (winner to
pull dray containing eight men).—J. Walpole s car-
digan (Carsons), 1 ; A. Conway’s Spot (Bougoure), L ,
Antonio’s Skipper (Ford), 3. —Queensland race item.
Now, the pride of Won’t-You-Wet-It -M on’t-You-Wet-
It in the West,
Is the races held to welcome the New Year,
When the Micks and Macs and Murphys don their go-
to-meeting best,
And Maloney taps a special brand of beer.
There’s a Maiden or a Trial; there’s a sprint for
station chaps ;
There’s a flutter for the fillies —ladies up ;
And for all the fancy neddies there’s a brace of han-
dicaps ;
And a Stockman’s Purse, a Hack Race and a Cup.
But last year the timber-carters—as they wished
their eyes might squint,
And themselves be stricken purple, blind or blue —-
Said they’d see the meeting blithered, and they’d
strike unless a sprint
Was included for the carters’ horses, too.
So the local sub-committee met and added, there and
then,
“Item 9: A Carters’ Horse Race,” to the card,
With conditions that “each starter pulls a dray with
eight grown men
Half a mile; ten quid the winner; boy-freight
barred.”
There was joy at Won’t-You-Wet-It when the drivers
heard the news,
And the axemen, half sarcastic, yelled “Hooray!”
Then there followed wordy meetings at the rival
camps to choose
Horses fit to face the flag on New Year’s Day.
So it chanced that four were entered, and the fav’rite
of the lot
Was The Clinker, from the camp at Scotchman’s
Hill;
But the Gully men had Gladsome, and the Creekers
swore by Spot,
While the townies pinned their faith to Bobadil.
Ni’v Year came with beer and bookies to that way-
back western town,
The neat was like the stove of Kingdom Come ;
So perhaps you'll understand a deep desire to “tear
it down,”
And an eagerness for treating folks with rum.
And perhaps it won’t surprise you, that with one
event to run
There was scarce a sober man upon the course,
And that Joe, the Gully driver, ere the great race
had begun,
Tried to harness in' the wrong end of his horse.
Still it’s fact, and, when the stewards posted up
“Race No. 9,”
Of the twenty-eight m en wanted for the drays,
Two were fighting in the paddock, some were sleep-
ing ’neath the pine,
And a hiccup was the best the rest could raise.
Joe was first to get his load on, and he heaped in all
his drunks
Like a lot of empty bags, though they were full;
And he used their chests to sit on, and he swore in
lurid chunks
When they shifted as old Glad, began to pull.
Bobadil, the townies’ fancy, driven by a Rechabite,
Was the next to make a move, but when ’twas seen
That his team was tonicked only to the verge of
talking fight,
Not a sober man would back him for a bean.
Hielan’ Mac had charge of Clinker, and his Scots
were grandly foo’,
But the lightest weight was missing—oh ! the sin !
So Mac took a loan of Hoolan who was sleeping
soundly too,
And with rope and twitch-sticks firmly tied them
in.
Last of all came Spot with Paddy—“ Paddy Boylan
from the Bogs”
(And ould Irelapd rushed an even money bet).
“Sure,” he said, “it’s me that’s knowing how to dale
wid seven hogs” ;
And he fastened down his men beneath a net.
Oh! the cheerful sight they furnished, all parading
down the straight,
While the bookies raked the shekels in galore ;
’Twas a Melbourne Cup in harness —a prelimin’ry of
weight
Such as not a mother’s son had seen before.
Then the flag fell. Like steam-rollers from the
starting point they tore,
Madly racing past the boree at the back :
And “It’s any money Gladsome,” cried the bookies
with a roar,
For alas! Joe’s freight was spilling down the
track.
Still he raced ahead unseeing; but the dray with
Bobadil
Hit a stump beyond the turn in front of Spot,
And the women laughed like ’burras at the townies’
sudden spill,
For the “tip” gave way and emptied out the lot.
But ’twas Paddy did the cursing, for he had to pull
out wide,
And the Clinker got a break of half a chain,
Which was pretty nearly doubled ere the Spot picked
up his stride,
And had settled down to business once again.
Oh! the riot of that racing! Like two funerals they
flew,
And a furlong in two minutes was the pace;
And as nearer, and yet nearer to the winning-post
they drew,
3eads of sweat stood out on everybody’s face.
Stride by stride did dauntless Paddy force the Spot
on at his best,
Stride by stride, and Ireland made the welkin ring,
For the gallant horse kept gaining; yea, though
white foam flicked his chest,
He was leaving yards behind —like anything.
But alas ! the way was very short, although the time
was long,
And The Clinker had by far too big a lead ;
He’d have won by many dray-lengths (and have spoilt
this bushland song)
If Tim Hoolan hadn’t done a gallant deed.
But he did; for, jolted sorely, he awoke, and gazing
round,
Saw 'ould Ireland’s horse still straining in the
rear;
Then he slipped the twitch, and, rising, lurched and
fell upon the ground
With a thud like to a falling hemisphere.
So the race was won for Ireland ; Scotland could not
weigh in eight.
But the mix-up at the end was very sad ;
Mac got into holts with Hoolan, and, I’m sorry to
relate
That two score of other chaps went fighting mad.
And away at Won’t-You-Wet-It, where the folk will
not abstain,
Whilst the best fight blazed that man has ever
seen,
All the bookies from the city slipped away and
caught the train,
And they didn’t leave behind a single bean.

Two days before the mining calamity at
YVyalong (N.S.W.), whereby six men were suffocated
by an inrush of gas, a similar happening took place in
the May Queen gold mine at the Thames (M.L.),
and closed the account of two men. A party of six
were drilling on the stopes when they' suddenly de-
tected gas on the level, and turned to escape to the
chamber above. One by one the candles went out,
and the struggle against the enveloping fumes went
on in pitch darkness. Now, one would be momen-
tarily overcome and fall; again, another would sink
back as if pulled down from behind. But all man-
aged to battle on somehow excepting three, named
Crawley, Guy and Williams. A search party found
Crawley supporting Guy’s head, as if he had been
trying to rescue his comrade when the atmospheric
poison seized him. Artificial respiration brought
Crawley round, but his mate died. Williams’s
tragedy no man knoweth. He lost his way in the
darkness, and did a solitary perish.
Another bush wedding :
It happened recently in a droughty district which
doesn’t keep cows, but where “J. Pannikin’s” Back o’
Sunset friends, William and Nancy Goat, are useful,
if troublesome, quadrupeds. The ceremony was in
progress, in the “front room” of the bride’s parents’
mansion, when a small girl rushed in with the alarm-
ing statement: “The goats is at the cake! ” —the cake
that had been brought a couple of hundred miles, and
was almost as important as the bride! There was a
general stampede, in which the ’groom and bride
joined. The parson, finding himself alone, went out
also. After a furious five minutes, an unnecessarily
persistent William and his lady friends were driven
off, with much damage to furniture and crockery.
Then we all went back, and the ceremony was com-
menced de novo, and concluded safely. When the
breakfast began, it was found that there was no
milk, the hoard of that doubtful fluid having been
spilled in the scramble. The bride insisted that she
had always done the milking, and would now ; so she
donned an old skirt over her bridal array, and ex-
tracted sufficient juice for the company’s needs. Then
we drank her health.
Strained relations exist between Mick
Flanagan, who works in a Victorian factory, and the
Church, as represented by Father O’Flynn. The cool-
ness began thusly. Flanagan cast his eye longingly
over a “bit of a horse,” owned by his spiritual ad-
viser, and managed to borrow the prad one after-
noon, getting a chum to hold the watch. As a re-
sult of the trial, Flanagan offered to lease the
quadruped for a term, and his riverenee agreed.
Shortly afterwards, Mick won a stake, with a bit
in hand, followed quickly by two others. The
Father woke up to the fact that good coin was flow-
ing into Mick’s pockets instead of into the coffers
of the Church, and told Mick plainly that he hadn’t
reckoned the horse would have been raced at all.
Flanagan smiled with one eye and winked the other,
and remarked quietly but firmly that there was
still half a year of the lease to run, and that he
was willing to entertain an offer of compensation
for the cancellation. The Father opined that this
was a low-down sort of idea, but said he would
think it over. He did —-and called to enlist the sym-
pathy of Mrs. Flanagan, senior—-who sadly owned
up that Mick was beginning to think for himself.
Another interview between the parties ended in the
Father telling Mick he was no sport. Mick coun-
tered by saying he saw nothing sportsmanlike in a
cleric who would worry a man’s mother when he
couldn’t get his way with the son, which remark
he emphasised by winning another race next day.
Subsequently another and still another brother cleric
called on Mick’s mother, and darkly hinted at
what might happen to that jaunty sinner in the
next world unless the horse was surrendered, but
Mick kept on never minding, being of opinion that
it was worth the risk while the handicapper was
lenient. The matter stands at that. The united
efforts of the Father and his friends have failed to
stop Dick’s triumphant march. Of course, they
can’t very well curse the horse whilst the lessee is
exploiting it, without running the risk of damaging
the reverend gent’s property, but writer hopes that
in the meantime they will not square the handi-
capper.
“THE KELLY GANG,” ONCE MORE.

NUISANCE (who ex-
pects to be invited to
stay overnight at sta-
tion): "Here come a
couple of sundowners.
I expect you find them
an awful—er —noosance
about here?”
SQUATTER : “Well, they bring their own
bedding, anyhow."
“Quiddam” : This was my closest call. We
were erecting a large Tangye compound condensing
engine. The bed was slung up from a traveller, and
was suspended about 2ft. from the concrete founda-
tion. We had previously skidded the bed through
mud, so half a dozen of us got under to clean the
muck off. It was an easy job lying on our backs on
the concrete, and most of the jobs there weren’t
easy, so we did it very carefully, and got in half an
hour of reposeful exertion in consequence. Then we
emerged, and began to move the engine into posi-
tion. One end was canted up a little, and the boss
told me to jump on the bed and remedy this. In-
stantly something occurred with a bump, and when
1 picked myself up I found that the sling had
broken, and the weight had fallen on to the concrete
with such vigor that a large portion of the cast-iron
sed was broken off. My comparatively small burden
was the last straw which had done the evil deed. It
cost the contractor £2O to repair that calamity,
but Heaven only knows how much it would have cost
him if the breakage had befallen a minute earlier,
ft would have been a distressful circumstance for
everyone but the undertaker.
“The Religious Editor”: I don’t know
iow much the innards of a dead horse weigh, or how
much space they take
up when packed for
transport; but, unless
something happens, an
angry man so encum-
bered will have toiled
into Melbourne before
this gets into print.
The works belong to
his deceased racehorse,
which is believed to
have been poisoned. It
will be the sad duty
of some analyst to ex-
amine the voluminous
contents of the fast
beast’s engine-room,
and endeavor to trace
the cause of its wret-
ched finish. The moral
seems to be that it is
good not to be a race-
horse and a darned
sight better not to be
an analyst.
“L’Fou”: Tallangatta (Yic.) is unques-
tionably the most popular frog-resort in the Com-
monwealth —possibly on earth. Local Biblical ex-
perts and others hold that the curse of frogs, which
smote Pharaoh where the hen gets the axe, in old
Egypt, was a trifling affair by comparison with that
which Tallangatta has patiently endured for as long
as it can well remember. You can always tell a
Tallangatta resident by the fact that, whether he
be in Pekin or Paris, or Nijni Novgorod or Tober-
mory (N. 8.), he invariably walks at night—step-
ping with an Agag-like lightness the while—in the
middle of the road. The explanation is that the
sidewalks in his native hamlet, being adjacent to
the drains, are so many heaving masses of promen-
ading frogs, from eventide onwards. Gelert’s dying
yell is nothing to the final exclamation of a
crushed frog. During the summer months, concerts,
dances and all musical entertainments are off, the
evening hymns of the marsh-dwellers being so loud
and long as to cause total or partial deafness. Were
it not for the silent picture-show film, Tallangatta
would probably perish of ennui—or frog.

“D.D.”: Re the cow and the kid. A
State-school teacher in the North Cowst (N.S.W.)
recently received a note from a parent, stating that
“Florrie would be able to attend school regularly for
some weeks, as she had broken her arm and could do
nothing at home.” Florence (aged nine) was the
note-carrier, and she did not miss a day till her
milking arm was mended.
“Condamine”: What is the greatest height
from which a rock wallaby can aeroplane and land
safely ? Met one on the Upper Murray recently, who,
rather than shake me by the front paw, dropped from a
30ft. eminence, cleared a water-hole and skipped up
the opposite bank with as little fuss as a Govern-
ment fleeing from its obligations.
“Eddyson”: “We called him Old Dough,”
said the bandy man who was odorous of sheep. “He
was cook with Harrigan for years. Must ’a’ tailed
up more ’n’ a million sheep in his time in an old,
tarpaulin-covered tip-dray, ’n’ doorin’ the spell I
was in Harrigan’s gang I never saw old Dough 30
yards away from that dray, when in ’ealth. When-
ever anythin’ unusual ’appened, more especial’ a
woman, that cook he headed fer his dray, same ’s a
rabbit runs for his burrer, ’n’ dived in, ’n’ there he
lurked, ’ard ’n’ fast, till the danger was past. I’ve
seen a bit o’ washin’ on a settler’s fence spoil a
dinner on us more ’n once. He told nothin’ re-
spectin’ them symptims iv his, but we comes to the
conclusion he is a pertickler woman-’ater, ’n’ sorter
sickened iv the subject. Once he come tearin’ into
camp in a blue ’n’ bristlin’ funk. ‘There’s a woman
drownin’ in the crick?’ sez he, ’n’ dives fer his
blankets. We sprinted across, ’n’, sure enough, there
was a woman lyin’ ’arf in ’n’ ’arf out the crick, she
havin’ fainted while gatherin’ water. One day
I was toyin’ with me horse near the fire
where Old Dough was tossin’ a steak, ’n’ Neddy
lashes out, ’n’ plants his left duke fair in cookie’s
chiv. Dough keels over, ’n’ we rushes him to the
nearest hotel, ’n’ has his face done in a bundle. We
’ad to pass on without him, him bein’ all out ’n*
fair dilly. At Bullfrog, Harrigan hired a female t’
go back ’n’ nurse our busted brother. Goin’ up with
some stud stock a few weeks later, we put across t’
pick up Old Dough. He was waitin’ for us at the
pub all right, but, struth! his face was such a ruin
I didn’t know him. I was dead sorry. ‘Dough,’ I
sez, ‘it fair breaks me heart.’ He shakes me by the
hand ez lovin’ ez a mother. ‘Not at all,’ he sez,
‘it’s a blessin’,’ he sez. ‘Fact is, it’s my wife I’ve
bin duckin’ ’n’ dodgin’ this tin year, ’n’ now, thanks
t’ this dislodgment iv me face, she’ll never know me
agin. But it was a near thing. That was her you
sent out t’ nuss me!’”
A NEW REMEDY.
The old friends of Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy
will be pleased to know that the manufacturers of
this preparation have gotten out a new remedy for
biliousness and all disorders of the stomach, liver
and bowels. It is called Chamberlain’s Tablets, and
has met with great success in the treatment of con-
stipation, biliousness, sick headache, impaired diges-
tion and liver disorders. It is easy to take, and
more pleasant in effect than pills. Chamberlain’s
Tablets not only move the bowels, but improve the
appetite and correct any disorders of the stomach
and liver. This is certain to be one of the most
popular medicines in use, and everyone who uses it
is pleased with the prompt relief it affords.*
HARDSHIP.

“Yes, Mum,” the digger said, “I know
Wot ’ardship is orlright—although
To look at me you’d hardly think

“I orfen sits and wonders how

“ ’Twas once when I was out of work,
I tramped from Charters Towers to Bourke,
Eight hundred miles, and all the way
’Twas rainin’ —nearly every day.
“Wot? Plenty water? I should think
They was! Why didn’t I have a drink?
I couldn’t, Mum, ’twas right outback
And not a pub upon the track.”

HENRY E. HORNE.
THE MAORILANDERS.
“Selwyn llider”—his story:—
Ihe \ outh of Maoriland does hoc err outrageously
on the side of reverence. When it doubts, it doubts
with its whole heart; and it strenuously denies what-
ever it regards as improbable. When it chooses to
believe, it believes vehemently, and the evidence of
all the ages cannot prevail against it. It holds that
murder is a thing properly prohibited, but that the
commandment to honor its father and its mother
is a discredited Hebrew tradition—a thing as obsolete
and stupid as the practice of phlebotomy. It will at
all hazards do as it pleases, except in those frequent
circumstances when it has no choice but to do as it
must. Those circumstances tend to multiply exceed-
ingly ; so that in a few months now it will be neces-
sary to pay a fee and procure a permit, should one
desire to smile in a public place. Then, or a little
later, there will come the recoil, for the Puritanism
that seems to control and smother the land is already
an affectation simply. Maoriland is a country of per-
sistent churchgoers who have no religion. When they
tire of the recurring ceremony, we shall have arrived
at the end of the beginning.
A little while ago I met a small boy in an outer
suburb of one of these small cities. Things were so
silent and dead there that the very birds seemed
scared to twitter. This was a very natty and confi-
dent small boy, and his expression; as he sat astride
of a huge farm-horse, plainly intimated that he would
stand no nonsense from live stock. I asked him where
I could get a drink of water, and he grinned the grin
of sympathy that is awakening to mature compre-
hension, and told me that there was a pub about a
mile down the road. I frowned upon him.
“Boy,” I asked him, boring him steadily with my
pained right eye, ‘do you ever go to church?”
“I went once,” he said. And then, apologetically,
“just to see what it was like.”
“Well?”
“It was rotten,” he assured me emphatically.
“Why?” I asked, greatly relieved and abashed by
these admissions. I felt rather shocked, for I know
a man who has been to church three times, though
all three wives are dead now.
“Yer see,” said my invincible horseman, “when I
got in I was chewin’ a lolly, an’ an old bloke wiv
whiskers told me to chuck it. A girl I knew was
sittin’ a bit further off, an’ when I whistled to her
the coves in my seat rousted on me.”
“So you’d sooner go to a circus?” I suggested,
guiltily conscious that I’d sooner go to a circus my-
self.
“You bet!” said he; and with that winked pro-
foundly and steered his formidable quadruped down
the road.
As a matter of fact, the preaching of parsons in
Maoriland is simply a sort of side-line, like the sneer-
ing bluff that Elijah played off on the priests of
Baal. They are chiefly concerned in the mixed busi-
ness of political agitation. They know less of politi-
cal economy than the average blowfly knows of archi-
tecture, and they have no more real democratic in-
stinct than a cow. They will tell you, if you can
persuade them to commit themselves, that the menace
of the Church of Rome lies principally in the fact
that the priests attempt to influence the votes and
opinions of the people. In their excuse it is to be
admitted that they have no saving sense of humor,
and probably don’t realise the nature of their offences.
Their point of view is set in a sort of cultivated
ignorance, fertilised by prejudice. They are the
creatures of cant phrases that they fashion into
fetiches and worship all day long in defiance of
their God ; but I don’t think they always ex-
pect you to take them seriously. They’ll tell you
that God is love, and despise you if you venture to
act on the information. They also see the recoil
looming, and they hate to think about it.
Sometimes I find myself wondering what the recoil
will bring. Despite all this clamor of neck-or-nothing
morality, the people are hardy and independent,
haters of dullness and lovers of pleasure. Many of
the things you don’t easily detect them doing they do
all the more enthusiastically because they do them
in secret. But all these things tell. When the recoil
comes, I think that Maoriland will be in all senses
the least temperate of Australasian States. It is
proving its asceticism by hoarding up its cake. The
land is so fat and resourceful, that even the unem-
ployed only take themselves seriously when they have
time to work' up to it. Except on these occasions,
you shall not discover the unemployed, even though
you look for them earnestly through the longest of
days. The unemployable are a small section, because
the country is unsuited to the dosser, and the average
Maorilander loathes a loafer very vehemently.
* * * *
The recoil is beginning. Even the loudest parsons
realise it, and are jangling and snuffling mightily to
keep the pall well down. In no place on earth are
women freer or more fully protected ; but the parsons
howl persistently for the fuller enfranchisement of
those useful persons and the severer punishment of
the Adam , who looks on Eve when she is willing.
There is a cry that picture-shows are immoral. The
demand is ceaseless that gambling shall be yet more
rigidly suppressed; although everybody knows that
the gambling habits of this community are as deep-
seated and inveterate as those of any community on
British earth. There is wonderfully little drunken-
ness in the country, or very little outside the No
License districts; but the prowling Prohibitionist
waxes fiercer and more insatiable every day. Every
man has a feeling of impending change, and so fights
the more noisily for the fetich he still lacks courage
to kick.
The religion of Maoriland is a queer thing, and its
high place is at Dunedin. On top, Dunedin is the
most moral and respectable town on earth; but just
beneath the surface queer things are wriggling.
Travelling footballers, and other handsome but
morally ramshackle youths, will tell you that in
Dunedin, Manon is so willing that Rahab has no
chance. The average Dunedinite will tell; you that
Rahab doesn’t exist, and that the Millennium has
arrived in Princes-street. No Christchurch man will
pretend that Rahab doesn’t exist; but he will tell
you that competition is so strong that she shall soon
have to retire. If you want to find Rahab in Well-
ington, you must make friends with a policeman. If
you want to escape Rahab in Auckland, you must
never go out, save in the company of two maiden
aunts, a fierce chaperon and an incorruptible bull-
dog. In face of these things, the parsons periodically
import a professional American evangelist, who makes
a large noise for three months, and then announces
that the whole community is converted. Then every-
body sits on the illegitimacy statistics, and the little
girls go into the parks and wave flags.
It will be a great place to live in, whenever the
fetiches faint or die.
“D.M.” : I concur with the remarks of
“Jaloon” (B. 28/12/’ll) re snakes’ sprinting powers.
Recently, whilst riding from Maffra to Briagolong
(Vic.), I witnessed a 22yds. race between a frog and
a brown snake. From a flying start froggy had a
lead of half a jump, which he increased to fully three
amphibian-leaps at the distance, and easily lost his
adversary in the long grass. So engrossed was one of
the contestants in winning the rubber and the other
in saving his steak, that they both passed under my
horse without noticing that he was a horse, and not
an ancient Roman aqueduct. I slew the snake so
emphatically that he died before sundown.

Laboucliere was profanely intolerant of

THE GREETING.
“Hullo, old chap! Still an actor—or unionist?"
Australia lost one of its best immigration
agents the other day, when John Delaney
designed at Parramatta, aged 88. His father
was one of Wellington’s heavy dragoons,
who finally unsaddled at ,the theoretical age
of 105. When 26 years of age, son John
married Mary Ann Ballard, at Parramatta,
and between them the couple brought along
29 of the best of all immigrants. The 12 survi-
vors of the original 29 were responsible for
108 more; and exactly how many they may
be credited with isn’t on record. John (son of
the just-dead John) had 18 children; daugh-
ter Ellen had 17; George and Martha, 12
.each; Robert and Jessie, 10 each. A great
femily those Delaneys, of the place Joe
.Cook misrepresents.

Hetty Green, the richest woman in the
U.S., and a very aged and tottery woman
nowadays, lately uttered a sort of farewell
to her country. With one leg in the grave,
she spoke thus :
Wholesale thievery is going on everywhere, and
the American people are willing to do anything for
money. Worse than this dishonesty, however, is the
shocking condition of American homes. There are
no homes in New York any longer. Women spend
all their time and monev o-n clothes and amusements
and let the homes take care of themselves. They
feed their husbands and children on tinned food.
The husbands get angry ; then there is a divorce; or,
if there is no divorce, the husbands get sick of tinned
food and die.
“Hullo” asks for information of an old
friend: —
Since the death, some five months ago, of Horace
G. Sappycook, 1 have looked in vain for some press
mention of his remarkable personality and his extra-
ordinary life, but, apparently, his excessive modesty
and reticence have enabled him to drop out without
notice. His career was so strange, so romantic, his
interests were so many-sided, and his personality so
beautiful, that I cannot understand this -neglect of
his friends. A year before his death he suggested
to me that I might write his biography; but the
materials I possess are so few that I have been wait-
ing- for some of those inimitable anecdotes that
clung to him, those weird adventures that seemed so
naturally to accord with his dare-Wowser soul. I
may mention that the late Horace G. Sappycook
was the author of two historic phrases. Once, on
getting into the train from Bourke, he said, with a
satisfied smile, “It’s capital leaving the country”;
and, on one never-to-be-forgotten afternoon, while
showing me Ms kitchen garden at Stratlifield, he
murmured sadly, “The thyme is not yet ripe.” The
only relation I have heard him mention was his aunt,
or “aunty,” as he affectionately termed her. Her
name was Sosh. When I last saw him he was mak-
ing horseshoes, or horoscopes, 1 forget which. But
I have heard him, in a moment of expansiveness and
beer, claim that “Henry Horsecollar” was a second
cousin. If either of these individuals is living, I
should be grateful for any facts, anecdotes of epi-
sodes in which this remarkable personality figured.
They will be incorporated in my forthcoming bio-
graphy.
About the great gospel of. Hustle: —
The bustling Yankee person is often so busy hust-
ling and bustling and rustling that he hasn’t time to
work. Also he is fond of leaving off toil to nail up a
big notice with the words, “Do It Now,” or “This Is
My Busy Day,” or “Never Put Off Till To-morrow
the Nigger that Can Be Fried To-day,” and a lot of
things happen during the time that is wasted. To
quote a case in point—King O’Malley is the most
notable rusher in the Australian Ministry. He is
like a kitten which is always bolting madly towards
nothing and stopping before it gets there. He is an
incarnate yell of energy, and a human dynamo. He
only hits the ground twice in a quarter of a mile.
He is a buzz-saw and a crack splitting through the
atmosphere. It is impossible to see his heels for
dust. It is hardly possible to sit down anywhere for
a quarter of an hour without seeing him go past. It
is hardly possible to sit down anywhere for half an
hour without seeing him on the return journey.
Doors fly open before he reaches them because of the
breeze he makes with the fury of his arrival, and un-
less the door is built to swing both ways it flies off
its hinges with the frenzy of his departure. He hasn’t
time to get his hair cut. He is always taking a short
cut for everything except his hair. He is reputed to
sleep in his hat through sheer want of leisure to
it off. And it is commonly alleged that this im-
ported flier is, among those Federal civil servants
Who have the misfortune to be under him, abo„c cue
most hated man who ever held a portfolio in an
Australian Government, and their one grievance is
that they Can’t Get Things Done. The wonderful
Minister is so busy hustling and jumping and hurry-
ing that real business has to stand over. Officials
swell visibly and turn purple when his name is men-
tioned, and allege that the job of extracting from the
King O’Malley department a reply to a simple official
letter is like moving a mountain, and that a railway
could be built during the delay. George Turner, in
his day, was the antithesis of O’Malley. He didn’t -
hustle. He never jumped in his life. He looked slow
and elderly and plain and brown and even sluggish.
- But he kept, on Doing Things, and he hated arrears
f more than he hated the Devil.
John Strange Winter (Mrs.
Stannard), who recently died in
England, was only 55, yet she
managed to turn out upwards of a
hundred novels. Miss Braddon has
just published her 69th. Annie
Swan has produced 94 and Flor-
ence Warden 115. But Miss L.
T. Meade holds the feminine record
with 222.
Thus the Gallery man of the London Daily
Express on Lloyd-George :
A joyous, half-exhausted, worn-voiced, bright-eyed,
waspish, honey-tongued, jaded, sunny-mannered Min-
isterial marvel. Without him the Radical party
would have gone to bits before now. With him it will
go to bits before long. He has beaten everybody the
oldest Parliamentary hand can remember in the feat
of doing about five times the killing amount of work,
vocal, physical, mental, and temperamental—and still
living. . . . There is only one man in England
who could have sjamboked, coaxed, guillotined,
whipped, cajoled, tortured, taunted, gibed, wheedled,
smiled, flattered, and charmed the House of Commons
into passing the great human principles of the Na-
tional Insurance Bill in their present setting.
“T.F.M.” rocks the cradle of the Argus :
Anent the Melbourne Town Clerk who founded the
Argus (B. 11/1/T2). It is true that John Charles
King was Melbourne’s first Town Clerk, but he wasn’t
the town clerk who founded the Argus. King was
clerk from the time of the town’s incorporation, in
1842, till 1851, when he was sent to England as an
emissary of the Anti-Transportation League; and a
dour Scot and Yellow Pup of the most pugnacious
type, Alderman Kerr, stepped into his shoes as clerk.
At an earlier period this Kerr had been connected
with Dr. Lang’s Sydney paper, the Colonist, and it
was he, and not King, who established the Port
Phillip Patriot, and hoisted the John Knoxian
motto: “I am in the place,” etc. The Patriot speed-
ily became merged in the Argus, and dragged its
.motto with it; and its whilom editor and proprietor
abandoned* journalism for the stiddy job vacated by
King. The subsequent downfall of Kerr gave Fitz-
gibbon his chance to become municipal boss of Mel-
bourne, and he took it, despite the hysterical efforts
of the Age, to block him. The White Knight had
shortly before dealt out some stoush to Ebenezer
Syme, in Elizabeth-street, in broad daylight, and
when hauled up to answer a charge of battery, was
acquitted without a stain upon his knigh'tly escut-
cheon. As for Kerr, he got the job of station-master
at Sunbury, though if anybody had accused him of
the slightest knowledge of practical railway work, he
could have proved an alibi.
MAKING FRIENDS OF THE MAMMON
OF UNRIGHTEOUSNESS.
PERCY (half full): “Look here! When you

Sixty-three years ago, a shipbuilder called
Fletcher came to Australia and .started to
work at his useful trade. He died the other
day, at Port Adelaide, in his 92nd year,
leaving the industry very much as he found
it in 1849. Of course, the country has not
done without ships; it has been importing
them at top speed all the time. The seas
are now alive with foreign-built steamers,
and the harbors littered with the aged and
coal-stained ghosts of worn-out imports.
Within the last few years, enough ship-
building orders to establish the industry 10
times over have gone to Bull’s workshop from
this country. The fleets have almost been
built anew, so rapidly has sea commerce
gone ahead; but Australia has missed the
chance to get the vitally important industry
going on a large scale, and to make the coun-
try a fit place for the skilled artisan whose
living is gained about a shipbuilder’s yard.
Under present conditions, a shipwright
might almost as well journey to Switzerland
as come here.
“The Old Soldier” : I see by this week’s
London papers that the Gaekwar of Baroda
has successfully pleaded the fact that he is
a sovereign ruler as a reason why he should
be discharged from the English divorce suit
of Statham v. Statham, It seems queer law.
The Gaekwar’s predecessor on the “gadhi”
was tried for attempting to poison the Resi-
dent in his State. He was defended by an Eng-
lish barrister, Serjeant Ballantine, who got
a record fee with exes, for getting the old
villain off. To the layman it would seem
that if one Gaekwar can be dragged before a
Court for alleged murder, there is no
reason why another shouldn’t be haled
there for alleged adultery. As a
matter of fact, the present man is
not an “independent prince.” Neither he
nor any of his predecessors have ever been
in any sense, independent. They have al-
ways been mere deputies of the Peshwa, who
was himself a sort of Mayor of the Palace to
the Raja of Satara, the nominal head of the
Mahrattas. The Gaekwar, as a vassal of the
Peshwa, came under British protection by the
Treaty of Bassein, concluded in 1802. The
present man is a Brahmin—a caste-brother
of the notorious Nana Sahib, who claimed to
be Peshwa by adoption. Nana had not,
however, been properly adopted by the last
Peshwa according to Hindu law.
THE NOBLE ART OF SELF-DEFENCE.
“ Hatpins, be damned! Wear blinkers,
like me. ”
Alfred Restieaux, oldest of
South Sea Island traders, died
lately in the Ellice Group. The
old man, who had been blind
for many years, started to earn
his tucker as an apprentice on
a brig in 1845 or thereabouts,
and for the next few years wan-
dered over most of the earth —»
the Australian goldfields, among
other places, also Peru, Utah,
Nevada and Honolulu via
’Frisco. One of his early trad-
ing stations was at Ponape in
the Carolines, and there Captain
Bully Hayes turned up with a
letter authorising him to take
over the station and wind it up.
Restieaux didn’t know Bully
Hayes then as well as he did
later on, and didn’t suspect that
the interesting document was
forged. Leaving Ponape Hayes
dropped Restieaux on McAs-
kill’s Island and left him there
with a p.n. for company. The
p.n. was for wages due and nat-
urally wasn’t any good. Still,
Hayes gave it plenty of time to
mature —he didn’t call back for
18 months. Restieaux found
Hayes much too strenuous
a skipper, so he started a trading station in
the Ellices, and began to qualify for the job
of patriarch of the group and most ancient
inhabitant of the South Seas.
Gone to even a longer rest than he had
in Tasmanian politics, William Dodery,
M.L.C., aged 93 years. The House of
Dodery was named after him, so he left a
footmark on the dust of history. He was
an Irishman, of Clonmel, and arrived in Aus-
tralia in 1825. He settled in Tasmania 81
years ago and became a member of the
Assembly 51 years ago. He went to the
Upper House 35 years ago, and retired five
years ago, after being president for three
years. Also, he married 70 years ago. He
was Chairman of Committees for 20 years,
and a member of the Longford municipal
council for 20 years. His beginnings date ;
back 10 years before the annexation of
Westralia to the British Empire and before
the settlement of Maoriland, S.A., or Vic-
toria, and he didn’t miss by much being a
contemporary of Captain Cook. In fact,
“A.D.” in Australia really means “After
Dodery,” just as “8.C.” signifies “Before
Cook.”
THE ETERNAL
WHINE.
Mr. Wade made some strong
points in his general criticism
of the McGowen Administra-
tion.... Perhaps the worst
thing that can be said of the
party is the shameless way in
which it has hung on to office.
—S. M. Herald.
N.S.W.: “For Heaven's
sake stop or change
your tune, you brute!”
A notable characteristic of Colonel
Ryrie, M.H.R., is his larrikin liabit of talk-
ing assault and battery, both in and out of
Parliament —his latest performance in this
line occurring at the Clontarf Orange fool-
ishness last Saturday. Ryrie is an excep-
tionally big and heavy man, who is known to
have learned boxing, to have patronised
prize-fights, and to have associated more or
less with pugs for years past. Presumably,
he is an expert supplier of stoush. Instead
of following the example of calm citi-
zens like Sam McVea, Langford and so on,
Ryrie habitually makes use of his advan-
tage to publicly timeaten unskilled light-
weights of the Holman stamp, that if they
don’t mend their political ways they will be
hurled through windows or have their hats
dashed off, and so forth. It is a cheap and
nasty sort of heroism at best—the class of
display that the genuine fighting man only-
makes when very drunk, and which he is
spurned by his fellow-pugs for making even
in those exceptional circumstances. Also, it
is illegal. But that aspect of the case is a
negligible trifles, possibly, to a sympathiser
with the lawless crowd that hurled missiles
at the Speaker’s head, the other day.
SLEEPLESSNESS.
Sleeplessness frequently arises from the liver. If
the liver is out of order it affects the nerves, and if
your nerves are in any way affected you cannot
sleep. Do not resort to narcotics; a course of Cham-
berlain’s Tablets will set your liver right, and you
will soon enjoy refreshing sleep.*
Do you want to grow a moustache?—a rich, lux-
urious supply of hair? Does your youthful appear-
ance hamper you in business affairs? Have you tried
pomades before with no success? Do you know that
no matter how slow your hair is in asserting itself,
you can grow a manly moustache? You want Capil-
larine. This is not a new moustache-producer, but
has been helping men to grow moustaches for years.
It has never failed where it was persistently applied.
Nobody can tell that you use it. You rub just a
little on your upper lip each night before retiring,
and in a remarkably short time the hair starts grow-
ing in abundance. It does not injure the skin; but
sinks right down to the very roots of the hair—nour-
ishes and strengthens them. Craig and Aitken, 654,
George Street, Sydney, sell it at 10s. 6d., post free.*'
MR. WADE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lines written in detection on reading a leader in
the Sydney Telegraph, headed “Mr. Wade.”
Although my memory is poor,
Somewhere and some time I am sure
I’ve heard of somebody called Wade —■
I can’t recall his age or trade —
Or have I in the papers read
Of someone who was once alive
In Nineteen-Two or Nineteen-Five?
So long I’ve heard
Of him no word
I’m sure he must be very dead.
But, stay! A dim old memory!
And can it be that it was he
Who, in a cellar’s damp retreat,
Dwelt hermit-like beneath the street ?
For saving miners from grim death —
Or was it surfers? —I forget,
Did he a hero’s medal get ?
Such men are few:
I wish I knew!
And does that hero still draw breath ?
Did he not once, though ’twas a wrench,
Decide to step upon the Bench?
I have a vagrant memory
He died a fat K.C.M.G.—
By now he must be quite decayed.
Or, during Wihis’s loud reign,
Was he by six policemen slain?
Won’t somebody
Enlighten me
Just who or what or which was Wade?

That is the nice way of putting it. The other way,
Which also happens to be the truer way, would trans-
form the small reserves into a big deficit, as follows:
Capital .. .. .. .. .. £2,212,969
Resenes 4,878
Total Funds £2,217,847
Less estimated deficiency in connection
with Assets Trust ‘ 928,726
Capital intact £1,289,121
Deduct the capital intact from the alleged capital,
and you get £923,848, which is the real deficit, pro-
vided the management’s valuations are correct. The
Assets Trust was the semi-independent concern created
after the boom had smashed ; its purpose in life was
to take charge of the worst-looking assets, and either
nurse them or realise them, or do some of both. Ip
other words, the Trust took over a certain amount of
assets and a corresponding amount of liabilities, and
the bank guaranteed the latter. For all practical
purposes the two concerns are, therefore, one; and
nowadays the bank frankly deducts the Trust’s esti-
mated deficiency from its own capital. Also, as the
bank makes profits in excess of the amount required
to pay 3 p.c. on its own pref. shares, it transfers the
amount to the Trust, which uses it to write down its
assets, and thus reduce its deficiency. Combining the
transactions of the two, we get these results:—
Pref. Writ- To
Dividend, ten Reduce
Profit. 3 p.c. Ofif. Deficit. Deficit.

Why the bank should continue to branjl itself as a
lame duck, isn’t clear. The operation can’t do it any
good, and may do it a great deal of harm. Banking
is mostly a matter of credit, and it can’t improve a
bank’s credit to be continually yelling into the public
ear that nearly half the capital is lost, and that some
of the shares get no dividend at all, while others get
only 3 p.c. It may be heroic to toil year after year
in order to replace lost capital. No doubt it would
be very heroic of a poor woman, with a large family,
who had lost her husband from small-pox, to struggle
to pay for the funeral. But she would be a very
foolish woman, all the same, if she had a placard
printed: “Board and lodging. Please patronise me.
My husband has been dead for 18 years, and his body
is still lying on the dining-room table and I want to
earn enough money to get him buried. Grills at all
hours. Also, ice-cream and cool drinks.” If the lady
put her dead husband out of the picture, and then
took in boarders, her large family wouldn’t be so
liable to feel hungry. It is exactly the same with
the Commercial Bank of Australia. If that lost capi-
tal were written off, and a fair arrangement were
made between pref. and ordinary shares, everybody
might get a taste, and the shares wouldn’t give the
bank the bad advt. of being continually at a dis-
count.
Who is to gain by persisting in the present policy
of restoring the lost capital ? Obviously not the pref.
shareholders. If the whole capital of £2,212,969
were restored—which would mean squeezing £923,848
out of future profits—the pref. shareholders could get
no more than 4 p.c. on their lot = £84,694 p.a. On
the capital alleged to be at present intact, the profit
is at the rate of over 9 p.c. p.a. Supposing, when
the capital was fully restored, it earned 7 p.c. That
would mean £154,900, which would leave £70,200
after paying the pref. div., and that £70,200 would
be available for div. on ordinary shares and for depre-
ciation, reserves, etc. As the ordinary capital is only
£95,619, the outlook for ordinaries seems gorgeous;
and at first sight it might appear to be in their in-
terest to restore the capital. But there are three
small items to be considered: (1) The pref. shares
outnumber the ordinaries, and as all shares have
equal voting power, it isn’t likely that the prefs. will
let the ordinaries draw a lavish div. to the prejudice
of the reserves, in which they (the prefs.) are vastly
more interested ; (2) to restore capital will, at the re-
cent speed, take nearly 20 years, and meantime the
ordinaries will get nothing ; (3) if anything bad hap-
pened to Australia and this bank (and a lot may
happen in 20 years), the ordinary capital would be
the first to be drawn upon. So the failure to have a
cleaning-up doesn’t suit the holders of ordinary
shares any better than it suits the others.
Certainly the bank is doing pretty well. This
shows its movements in 12 months:—

But go back to 1890, and make some comparisons
with another bank:—

Deposits .. 9,247,827 7,124,152
Advances 9,934,460 5,520,404
One yarn is good until another is told, and the yarn
of what the C. B. of A. has done, looks all right until
the history of the B.N.S.W. suggests what the other
might have done. It seems to be time the C. B.
of A. considered seriously whether it is not being
handicapped, and, if so, whether the handicap can’t
be got rid of.

This is the best dividend the City of Sydney has
paid since 1895, when the shareholders got 5 p.c.—
and shouldn’t have done anything of the kind. But
it happened that this bank, like a few others,
wouldn’t see what an ass it had been. Then, from
being an ass, it turned itself into an ostrich, and
burying its head in its bad debts, refused to admit
that such things were there. Instead of writing off
its losses and facing the world with a clean sheet,
it issued accounts, term after term, purporting to
show that its capital of £400,000 was intact,
whereas its dividend of p.c. yelled as loud as it
could that a lot of that capital either didn’t exist
at all, or was represented by unproductive assets.
The public knew well enough that something was
wrong, but it didn’t know how wrong ; so the bank
naturally didn’t make much progress so far as new
business was concerned. Fortunately, it had the
support of a few influential people; more fortunately
still, Australian conditions improved so much that
no doubt the bank was able to make a pretty good
clearance of the old depreciated assets. Thus, though
some of the figures haven’t grown appreciably, the real
position of the bank has most likely improved very
much. Fifteen years ago the advances and such-like
assets stood in the books at £1,202,495; to-day,
though they stand at only £1,614,403, they may
really be worth twice as much as they were 15 years
ago. There is, certainly, no sure way of ascertain-
ing what a bank’s assets really are worth, because
bank directors are under no obligation to observe the
stupid old rule which says that there are 20s. in£l,
and they may publicly represent an asset as worth
£1 when it wouldn’t fetch 10s., and they may go
on doing so for years on the specious excuse that if
they nurse it long enough it will be worth 20s.
There isn’t any reasonable doubt that, in order to
bring the 10s. asset up to the 20s. mark, the direc-
tors of this bank have been grabbing profit whenever
there was a bit to spare, and piling it on top of the
10s.; and that grab explains the wonderful uniform-
ity in the column devoted to profits. The only
hint as to the actual trend of things is contained in
the gradual improvement in the rate of dividend;
it is presumed that the directors wouldn’t push up
the rate like that if the old 10s. asset was not gradu-
ally getting up to the 20s. mark. But let it be un-
derstood that it is entirely a question of trusting
the judgment of directors and managers; and direc-
tors and managers are still a little lower than the
angels. If they were not they would hardly have
paid a 10 p.c. div. early in 1893, on the very eve of
the banking smash; also, there is a suggestion of
fallibility in the fact that in 1904 they paid 4 p.c.,
and then found that 24 p.c. was all the bank could
afford. Therefore, the man who follows the stock
up and buys at the steadily advancing prices, on the
strength of the steadily advancing dividends, is
backing the judgment of men whose predecessors’
judgment—if not their own—has more than once
been at fault. Of course, there are other things that
such a man may reasonably take into account. In
particular, things ought to be improving. During
the last few years any Australian bank would almost
have had to work overtime at the job if it had
wanted to block itself from improving its position.
In 12 months there have been these visible
changes:—

Total liabilities are £1,707,117. Coin and liquid
assets total £342,733. The liquid holding is thus
20 p.c. of the liabilities, and it isn’t enough. Chair-
man Gould, speaking at the shareholders’ meeting,
snarled at the Commonwealth Bank project; it was
to be “viewed with distrust, not so much for its
effect on the private banks, as in the interests of
the general credit and well-being of the community.”
If the gallant colonel who leads the City Bank had
known discretion, he would have thrown no bricks
while his own bank held liquid assets representing
only 20 p.c. of its debts to the public. That its
position is perfectly sound under normal conditions
this paper doesn’t doubt. It has £1,795,279 of non-
liquid assets, against the £1,364,378 of debt not
represented by liquid assets; and that would allow
for a very severe shrinkage indeed. But, on paper,
its capacity to meet a sudden shock is far less than
“the general credit and well-being of the commun-
ity” seem to this critic to require.

Besides the reserves mentioned in the last line, there
are: Premiums on shares, £282,225; meter replace-
ment fund, £18,273 ; total, £300,498. And besides
those, again, there is an unmentioned amount up the
directors’ sleeves. Go back 10 years, and you will
find that the co.’s “fixed investment”—land, build-
ings, machinery, mains, etc.—charged to capital ac-
count was £1,141,001. The revenue from sales of
gas, etc., in that half-year was £199,791. The
“fixed investment” now is £1,328,546, while the -re-
venue last half-year was £329,885. So, on a capital
expenditure of £187,645 in new works, the co. has
in one half-year derived an extra revenue of £130,094.
The thing, of course, is ridiculous. If it called for
£1,141,001 of plant, mains, etc., to produce £199,791
of revenue, in the same proportion it would now call
for £1,800,000 of plant, mains, etc., to produce
£329,885 of revenue. This paper doesn’t say that it
is possible to arrive accurately at the real value of
the plant, etc., in that way. But the calculation
gives a line, at least, to the exact position, and' sug-
gests very strongly that in the past 10 years, in ad-
dition to paying the 15 p.c. dividend, the co. has put
anything up to £500,000 of undisclosed profit into
works, nominally as a set-off against depreciation. It
is certain that this co. has been doing better than the
Melbourne co. : and the latter co. owns up to having
spent over £l* 5,000 in this way in four years. If,
as seems probable, this Sydney co. has spent £50,000
a year, it means about 6 p.c. on the capital—6 p.c.
p.a. on the capital, not added to the dividend cer-
tainly, but put into a hidden reserve fund, in order
to strengthen the co.’s position.
Of course, it will be said that there is deprecia-
tion to be provided for, and that a reasonable way to
provide for the wear and tear of one lot of assets is
to pay for another lot of assets out of profits. That
is all right; but nobody is likely to suggest that
there haven’t been renewals during the 10 years, and
the assets which existed 10 years ago were probably
not worth one penny more than the corresponding
assets which exist to-day. And that being so, the ad-
ditional assets represent so much added value, and
are not a mere set-off against depreciation at all.
Obviously, a co. can’t go on for ever socking away
hidden profits and piling up internal reserves. The
only justification for doing anything of that sort is
that prudent managers ought to provide for contin-
gencies. But if the contingencies don’t arise, one of
three things is usually done —new shares are issued
as a bonus, and the hitherto-undisclosed profit is
mopped up that way ; or new capital is got in, and,
though it may be earning only 4 p.c., 15 p.c. is paid
on it; or the consumer is given the benefit of the
affluence. Nowadays also, the man who actually does
the hard graft is liable to line up for a cut. It is,
no doubt, the terrible thought that the union and the
consumer may both show their teeth that prompts
this co. to tell practically nothing of much conse-
quence about its operations. It knows well enough
that it is surrounded by teeth and claws, and that
to keep the wolves off it must now and then throw
out some scrap of a concession. And it naturally
wants to put itself into such a position that it can
throw out numerous scraps without imperilling its
sacred 15 p.c. Though, admittedly, the facts can’t
be stated definitely, it certainly looks as though it
has got into that position now. Wherefore it pro-
poses to take measures so that it may get a . few
more scraps for itself. To that end a Bill is to be
introduced, authorising the issue of more capital.

The reserves are made up of these items
Premiums on shares .. .. £466,535
Formal reserve fund .. .. 87,016
Meter renewal reserve .. 21,209
Unappropriated profit .. 14,851
Total .. £689,611
The reserves have moved, in eight years, from
£572,346 to the total just mentioned, which means
a growth of only £17,266. It isn’t a crime to
treat that as a joke.' The sober fact is that, instead
of putting surplus profits into visible reserve funds,
the money has been spent on new works, and the
cost of those works has been written off, so that
they do not show anywhere in the accounts. In the
past half-year £28,223 has been diverted to this
purpose. And that doesn’t mean the renewal of
worn-out works. The cost of that part of the busi-
ness is provided for quite independently. Some of
it is charged direct to working expenses, the balance
is provided out of the amounts shown above as
written off. These amounts written off, it will be
noticed, have increased very much during the past
18 months. This is due to the opening of a Works
Reconstruction Account, into which £40,000 has
been dropped during the past year. The whole
position, then, can be summarised like this. Be-
sides paying a dividend at the rate of 10 p.c. p.a.
for the past six months, the co. has paid for all
current repairs and maintenance, including renewal
of retorts; has put by £20,000 for “reconstruc-
tion of works”; has spent £28,223 on new works;
and, on top of all that, has had £6524 left over
to augment the general reserves. If a man wrote
that the co. has been doing pretty well, he would
not deserve arrest for driving his pen recklessly
through a public sheet.
Observe that, in the tail half of 1904, the profits
amounted to £61,941, whereas, by the same compu-
tation, they now amount to £105,170. Yet the
total expenditure on works, etc., charged to capital
account, has increased only from £2,149,842 to
£2,182,737. This means that the profits have more
than doubled, though the new works charged to
capital amount to only £32,895. It is obvious
from this that either the old works are now enor-
mously more profitable, or that a vast number of
new works have been provided out of the con-
sumers’ pockets, instead of out of capital, or that
both things have happened. The last alternative
seems the most likely. The accounts admit that
£270,238 of profit has been spent on new works in
the seven years; and to that amount should be added
a good many other thousands spent on the “recon-
struction” of works —no doubt to their improvement.
Of recent years the expenditure of profits on new
works—which, of course, belong to shareholders—
amounts to over 5 p.c. on the capital. This is in
addition to amounts spent on maintenance, renewals
and “reconstruction.”
For last year the receipts from the sale of gas
totalled £606,435 (coke, tar, etc., are additional).
In the same period the profits, less depreciation (but
not including amounts spent on new works or “re-
construction”), were £188,007. Deduct 10 p.c.
dividend and £102,287 remains. It seems, there-
fore, that last year the income was £102,287 in
excess of the amount required to pay working ex-
penses, provide for maintenance and renewals, and
pay a 10 p.c. div. And £102,287 is slightly in
excess of one-fifth of the gross revenue from gas.
So, on last year’s record, the co. could reduce its
charges for gas by one-fifth, and still pay 10 p.c. and
maintain its works, even if the reduction did not
produce any extra business, which it would be
pretty certain to do. Whether 1911 was a normal
year is another matter.
The municipalities have the right to buy the
undertaking “upon paying to the co. a sum equal to
18 years’ purchase of its net annual profits, estimated
on the average of the three then next preceding
years,” or upon terms to be mutually arranged. It
is hard to say what the true net profits of a gas co.
are. The profits as shown above for the past three
years were £529,192 in the aggregate. Deduct
£20,000 a year for depreciation not charged direct
to revenue account, and £469,192 remains = say
£156,400 p.a. On 18 years’ purchase that would
mean £2,815,200. The interest bill (4 p.c.) on
that purchase price would be £112,608, which
would be the profit that it would be necessary for the
councils to make to pay the Cohen who would take
the place of the present shareholders. A 1 p.c.
sinking fund, and $ p.c. for contingencies and extra
depreciation, would absorb £42,228. Total for in-
terest, sinking fund and contingencies, £154,836, or
less than the community is now, as an average,
pouring into the co.’s pocket. And the £154,836
includes a sinking fund which would wipe out the
capital debt inside 42 years, and thereafter relieve
the city (if thought desirable) of the entire interest
charge. Lven under present abnormal conditions a
good case can therefore be made out for the exercise
of the purchase provisions in the Act.

The few remarks laid reverently on top of the table
suggest that, when this co. fell into the soup, at the
bursting of the boom, it fell in right up to the neck.
When the co. had pulled itself together sufficiently to
clean up the mess, it wrote down ordinary capital
from £369,602 to £3500 ; and even the pref. shares
had to be written down from £5 to 305., though, in
addition, they got a deferred share of ss. So the
12* p.c. div. on these ordinary and deferred shares
isn’t quite as affluent as it looks. In ease the
writing-down had been too severe, it was arranged
that, as the old properties were sold, any surpluses
should be put into a special reserve for the benefit of
these two classes of shares ; and the next table shows
how this operation has panned out so far: —

This special reserve isn’t included in the first table.
How the total is going to be divided hasn’t so far
been mentioned. Still, the division really doesn’t
very much matter, as lbng as the holders of these
ordinary and deferred shares get a dividend to corres-
pond with the total reserves and capital standing to
their credit. Their capital is £32,406; add
£59,460 reserves; total, £91,866. The £4050 which
they drew last year was equal to a shade under 4*
p.c. on the average amount to their credit; and
though it might well be a trifle more, in order to
bring it up to 5 p.c., the ordinary shareholders, at
any rate, haven’t much to complain about. In fact,
they wouldn’t have much to complain about if they
had disappeared altogether. The special reserve,
by the way, includes only actually realised surpluses;
the directors remark that “the realisation at moder-
ate prices of the [remnant of the] securities parti-
ally realised, and the completion of payments on
sales already made on extended terms,” would in-
crease the total to approximately £95,000.
The bank is now taking new business —including
deposits—and this sets out the position of the old
and the new combined:—

The most cheerful feature is the rapid clearing-out
of the old “land” asset—no doubt a weary, unpro-
ductive heap of garbage-strewn suburban securities.
New advances move along hopefully; the money is
mostly derived from fixed deposits, which are very
fully protected. In fact, the liabilities in excess
of liquid assets don’t amount to one-half the book or
written-down value of the remaining assets; and a
depositor can’t want better security than that.

The amounts added to a reserve for depreciation,
public risk and contingencies are not necessarily
profit. They may, indeed, be quite as much a fair
charge against revenue as wages are. The main point
in the present case is this: Is depreciation provided
for otherwise ? It is impossible to speak positively;
but it is .just about certain that it is. Six months
ago ship property stood in the books at £179,988.
Since then the Kiandra and Kosciusko ferry steamers
have been completed, and four new vessels of the
Kiandra type are under construction, and one new
hull; and as these should be ready in about six
months, no doubt large payments have been made on
account of them. Yet ship property stands in the
present accounts at only £lBO,OBl, which makes it
practically certain that very large amounts have
been written off —in other words, that most of the
payments for the new steamers have been made out
of undisclosed profits. This, of course, has been the
policy all through. As at December, 1901, ship pro-
perty stood at £52,356. In the next five years the
big ferries Koree, Kummulla, Kulgoa and Kareela
were purchased, yet the ship property item only ad-
vanced to £60,687. That is to say, all but £8331
of the cost came out of undisclosed profit, nominally
sopped up to counterbalance depreciation. In the
past five years the item has moved from £60,687 to
£186,082, and the vessels provided include the
Kaikai, Kailoa, Kirrule, Kiandra, Kosciusko, Kan-

etc., and payments have been mad hag

been anything from 50 p.c. upward therefore
sum charged to capital It is
that depreciation has been consistently P
apart from the visible denreciation fund.
The matter may be looked at from another heap
of figures. In 1902, 20,000 shares were ,
par, in 1907 another 40,000 at aml m 1910
100 000 were issued on payment of 4s. casn, witn
10s callable This last 10s. has been practically all
paid up; only £29 was outstanding on December 31.
Since 1901 therefore, £129,971 of new capital has
been actually got in. The assets have changed as
follows: Dec., 1901. Dec., 1911.
Ships . • £52,356 £186,082

JS d ,S,“ :: JS
Total .. £141,952 £433,744
Less Liabilities.. 14,118 5,613
Net .. £127,834 £428,131
The increase in the book value of the net assets has
thus been £300,297 in 10 years; and, as shown just
now only £129,971 of new capital has been got m.
The balance of £170,326 has come out of profits
earned in excess of the dividend. But that doesn t
end the matter. Another point is, are the assets
which have been added in that period all shown at
full value in the accounts? If not, then, of course,
the profits over and above the dividends exceed the
£170,326 mentioned above. Put it in another way.
The new capital got in during the past 10 years
totals £129,971. Liquid assets and landed pro-
perty (less liabilities) have increased from £69,986
to £232,844 ; that is, by £162,858. So the growth
of these two assets alone represents more than the
entire new capital put up, which means that all the
new steamers provided during the past 10 years have
been paid for out of profits, as well as all the ad-
ditional plant, stock, etc., and £32,887 besides. And
all the time the shareholders have been getting a
sweet dividend. Nominally, the div. now is 10 p.c.
But —well, here is a little list to show how the pre-
sent capital is made up:—
Capital of old co. .. . • £60,000
First watering (1899) . . . . 60,000

Paid in Cash .. .; ; ; £189,971
Bonus shares and payments ~ 110,000
fatal ~ ~ .. £299,971
So the i 0 p.c. is really about 16 p.c.; and, notwith-
standing that, the surplus profits have provided the
whole of the fleet added during the past 10 years, as
well as the other things mentioned above.
And the next 10 years? The bridge or the tunnel
may come; but, after all, the co. probably doesn’t
get more than one-eighth of its revenue from the
people who travel to Milson’s Point, and 95 p.c. of
the others will no doubt go on using the ferries.
Whether the Greater Sydney Council of the compara-
tively near future will permit this co. to then retain
the ferries is another question ; and it isn’t one for
the financial post-mortem- ist to decide.
At the Great Gobar meeting in London
the chairman threw the blame for the poor results
of tile past 18 months on to “the labor troubles in
Australia.” This sort of thing gets tiresome. The
chief causes of Cobar’s trouble are: (1) The co.
paid far too much for the property ; (2) paying far
top touch for the property, the promoters had great
difficulty to raising the capital, and the hawking that
had to he done and the concessions that had to be
offered cost the co. £167,000 ; (3) the
plant, as Originally designed and built by
a foreign engineer. Was pronounced unsuitable
after causing endless trouble, and probably
£120,00(3 Was wasted in that Way; (4) the
waste Of money at the surface Was so tremendous
that the CO. Couldn’t apparently spare the money to
open up the mine in such a way as to make cheap
extraction and hauling possible; and (5) the ore.
Which so recently as 18 months ago Was estimated
to give 2| p.c., yielded last term less than 2 p.c.
Certainly, Cobar can’t get men for 7s. a day, and it
probably has a difficulty to keep the best men at all.
But that isn’t due to “the labor troubles in Aus-
tralia,” It is due to the fact that Cobar is one of
the toost unattractive mining camps in Australia—
so unattractive that the general manager Would pro-
bably see the shareholders fried before he would keep
his family there all the year round,

The old Sunny Corner (N.S.W.) will
again be heard from shortly. For years it has been
locked up; hut the money to give it another chance
is coming from England, and recent developments
suggest that there is something well worth going for.
It is understood that merely enough capital has been
secured at present to prove whether the mine is
bad enough to turn down or good enough for a big-
gish float.

Cope’s Creek Central (N.S.W.) realised
£8937 from sales of tin for the half-year, out of
which sum it scored £4057 profit. A game of that
kind naturally gives a dredging concern a keen ap-
petite for more ground, so check-bore holes are being
put down on Skeleton Creek, with a view to pur-
chase. As 6.71 d. has been paying expenses, stuff
yielding lib. of oxide per cubic yard gives a liberal
profit with oxide at Is. per lb.
Vegetable Creek (N.S.W.) has much
improved prospects in a winze 132 ft. from Chandler’s
shaft. The prospecting drive was put in at a high
level, and when the bore through the pipeclay gave
favorable indications, a winze was sunk which bot-
tomed on 4in. of wash of similar quality to that now
being worked from the Rock shaft. There is a strong
dip towards the main channel. The eastern leading
drive from the latter is also in better ground, so
there is a chance of a substantial improvement at two
different points. The weekly output is about 41 tons
of tin oxide, and this keeps the pot .boiling.*
Emmaville district (N.S.W.) produced
1040 tons of tin oxide last year, valued at £120,640
= £ll6 per ton. Practically all of it was produced
by dredging and sluicing cos., at a cost of from 6d.
to Bd. per lb.; so sales, at a fraction over Is. per lb.,
have given a liberal profit. The best returns are
from the Y Water Hole, which has just sluiced 70
tons (156,8001 b.) from 92,500 cubic yards (slightly
over ljlb. per cubic yard) in 972 hours. #

Bellevue (W.A.) remains paralysed. Want
of money prevented it doing a hand’s-turn during the
past year, but some tribute parties tried their luck.
Two of them earned a trifle more than wages, but the
rest didn’t get past tucker. Altogether 1680 tons
were raised and crushed, and out of the proceeds the
co. received £6Ol in royalty. Seven leases have
lately been abandoned as being of no value under ex-
isting conditions; and for all the good that share-
holders are ever likely to get, the rest might as well
go the same Way. Nearly £750,000 worth of bullion
has been Won to date; but owing to refractory ore, ex-
pensive treatment, ruinous Working costs and con-
tinual reorganisation of plant, all this Wealth, as
Well as a thumping big working capital, has been
swalloWed up. The outlook seems hopeless.
Chaffers (W.A.) is now estimated to have
104,900 tons of 28s. 9d. ore in sight, and in order to
crush this stdne profitably the manager recommends
that the milling capacity of the plant be increased
to 6000 tons per month. By this means he hopes to
reduce costs to 265. 3d. per ton, and show a net
profit of £12,937. Before deciding one way or the
other, the Board has arranged to have the reserves
checked by an independent expert, and meantime ore
treatment has been suspended. The funds in hand
amount to £16,400, of which £15,000 is invested
in Government stock, and the balance is in cash and
loans on security. H. J. Giflin has succeeded the late
Lewis Aarons as chairman, and a son of the latter has
been elected to the vacant seat on the Board.^
In concluding some suave observations
from the chair at the Bullfinch meeting, Doolette,
sen., said that out of the moneys put up as working
capital, £46,000 had been expended in equipment,
development, etc., and preliminary expenses. The
credit balance was now over £30,000, and as a
further £23,850 could be got from the sale of reserve
shares when required, the eo. had ample funds to last
it until the treatment plant was completed and gold
production begun. But the market pendulum still
swings back, and not even the chairman’s announce-
ment has stopped the movement.
* * *
North White Feather (W.A.) ends its
finahcial year With a remark that it found it possible,
by effecting economies, to meet working expenditure
and development outlay out of revenue, which totalled
£24,824. Beyond this it had nothing of interest to
say, and judging by the outlook its voice may soon
be stilled for ever. #
Paddy’s Flat line of reef at Meekatharra
(W.A.) produces further proof of permanency. In
the Fenian, 16£dwt. to 60dwt. values have been re-
vealed in winzing below the Nos. 5 and 6 levels, ore
averaging 80s. for 7ft. has been proved by a crosscut
at 600 ft. in the adjoining Ingliston Consols, and at
85ft. below the 300 ft. level the lode in the next (In-
gliston Extended) lease assays 70s. As a group, these
and two or three other shows alongside are better
than anything 1 else in the West outside Kalgoorlie,
and the lasting of their shoots in depth gives the
Westralian gold industry a little firmer foundation
to stand on. #
Black Range (W.A.) is the centre of a
storm that is sundering Victorian Western district
ties. When Hans Irvine and Tom Robertson brought
the proposition from Westralia, it soon was seen that
the hazel twig in Robertson’s deft hand had divined
a “bonser.” Divs. appeared as regularly as the milk-
oh’s bill; also, there was a bit to spare for side-
shows. A baker’s half-dozen of these side-shows have
been tried, and have flickered out, with Hans Irvine
still optimistic. While the bawbees have been flow-
ing into new claims, Tom Robertson has got more
and more dour, until his supply of the milk of human
kindness seems to have been exhausted. Now the
mittens are off, and a ring is being pitched for a
set-to next month between him and his old co-adven-
turer. The stake is the control of the Black Range
mine, for Irvine hints that if Robertson wins the pre-
sent Board of management will go out. Plain speak-
ing is as plentiful as spume on the sea-shore. Rob-
ertson’s cry is that any fool could get good divs., out
of the Black Range itself. Such sparring and the
talk whether this one or the other one is to go off the
Board is, after all, beside the mark, for what the
shareholder intends is to have an end to wrangling
and get an overhaul of the mine, to tell whether the
bottom level smells as sweet as Irvine’s best claret
cup. , , ,
Phil Bright, son of the John Bright of
polities, and boss of the Boulder Perseverance Board,
has just had a casual glance at the Kalgoorlie mines.
Not being an expert, Bright very wisely declined to
say much about what he saw; but in regard to the
Perseverance, he said that it was intended to give the
unexplored portions of the higher levels a systematic
raking fore and aft. Like almost everything else on
the field, the Perseverance is looking very pale and
sickly in the bottom workings. #
The Gimlet, at Ora Banda (W.A.), has
again been handed back to its owners. Oroya Links
had it on trial for a time, but gave it up on account
of the big sum of money required for equipment and
proving the reef a't depth. The Gwalia South then
came along and worked at it, until hard country and
a falling off of values caused that co. to down tools
and clear out. #
G. C. Willcooks isn’t much heard of ih
connection with Queensland mining nowadays; but
the Willcoclts Copper Mines, Ltd., and the Willcocks
Cloncurry Copper Syndicate, Ltd., still drag out
an existence. The former took over some southern
and central shows which Willcocks had financed;
the latter holds some Cloncurry prospects. Both are
either doing nothing or doing poorly. Since it
started, the Copper Mines, Ltd., has gone £10,006 to
the bad, and is now marking time; the other is
£10,518 to the bad, and is marking time in an even
more tired way than the Copper Mines, Limited.
Brilliant Deeps, Charters Towers, gets
more enthusiastic backing since the chairman made his
little speech. He expects that the 25,000 new shares
will bring in £9375 ; but that is 7s. 6d. each, and
the offer to take 7s. paid in a lump sum is sure to
be availed of to some extent. The development of
two levels and the ■ installation of a new hauling
plant will run away with a lot of money ; still, the
directors expect the new issue to pay off the over-
draft (£4552), and leave enough to carry on with
for two or three months without making calls. The
next crushing will also help them over an expensive
period. Chairman Millican told shareholders that
200 ft. of driving along No. 4 west level had produced
413 tons of stone, and that 323 tons had been crushed
for £2323. The first return was 103 tons for £986,
and the last lot of 48 tons gave £711; so this level
has given 151 tons worth £1697, and 172 tons
worth £626. There are 100,000 contributing shares
with a liability of Is. per share, making the un-
called capital £5OOO. The chairman was unable to
give any assurance that this money would not be re-
quired. . „
* * * *
For some time past Chillagoe -has done
practically all the copper smelting in N. Queensland,
but the Mammoth Co. is now building a smelting
plant near the Chieftain mine, at Arbouin, a few
miles from Mungana. Half a dozen likely-looking
copper shows are being developed at shallow levels.
Most of the lodes are narrow. The Lochinvar, at a
depth of 60ft., has Ift. of ore, assaying 8 p.c. copper
and 6dwt. gold; the Chieftain has a vein giving as
much as 17 p.c. copper and Bdwt. gold; the Noonday
has a lode 2ft. thick, assaying fairly well for copper.
The feature of this district is that the copper ore is
fairly rich in gold, and the concentration of metals in
a narrow lode channel has advantages. The diamond
drill has also located what looks like good ore in the
Jubilee mine, nearer Mungana. Some of the
machinery from the O.K. mine is being utilised, and
metallurgist Shepherd, who was once in charge at
0.K., is taking a hand. * #
Last year Scottish Gympie (Queensland)
crushed 81,800 tons, for an average of sdwt. 6gr.,
worth 18s. 3d. per ton. This concern is in 660,000
shares, so the £16,500 paid away in dividends gave
6d. per share. On this output it required a profit of
a fraction over 4s. per ton to provide the year s divi-
dend, so unless the Scottish has been paying away
more than it earned, its costs only mopped up 14s.
2d. per ton. #
Gympie mines that did fairly well last
year were No. 2 S. Great Eastern, which paid Is. 7d.
( £11,400) ; No. 3 Columbia, Is. lOd. ( £7333) ; No.
1 North Columbia, Is. Id. ( £5200) ; No. 1 North
Victory, 2s. (£4800). No. 2 S. Great Eastern
crushed 12,260 tons for 58,3440 z. This co. s outlook
for 1912 depends mainly on developments on the
Inglewood reef at a depth of 2000 ft. The crosscut is
out far enough to strike the reef, so news may be ex-
pected any day. # #
Lord Nelson’s flag is fluttering jauntily
at St. Arnaud (Vic.), on account of a return to
profit-making, the gold from the 2225 ft. level having
sweetened up to a 6 Jdwt. grade. This _ average is
likely to be maintained for the next six months.
There is a height of over 65ft. and a length of 510 ft.
of stone to beat out at this level; and there is a good
prospect of dirt of equal quality coming from 2405 ft.
All the profits that make the co. chirpy seem to be
from the stone coming out of the North Nelson-
ground which Zeb Lane, sen., wouldn’t have tor the
old Lord Nelson Co. Dead Wallace and Schlichtmg
spent their years skirmishing in the upper levels of
this claim instead of beating down to pick up the
shoot on its underlay into the lease; and the more
daring owners and managers of to-day get the re-
ward the others missed. #
Central Cathcart, Ararat (Vie.), has got
what the irreverent call the pip, and all because the
Board has decided to increase calling powers so that
the co. may get in 6d. a time, besides borrowing on
the plant. The proper policy is not to patronise the
three balls, for, with scrip at a solid premium, no
one will forfeit, even if sixpenny calls are made.

The man who wrote about the New Langi
Logan (Vic.) and the non-reporting of recent devel-
opments, went wrong. He said that the Melbourne
dailies on January 12 announced that the bore was
up 69ft., and that some of the uninitiated must have
marvelled when they heard an hour or two later that
the bore was up to 88ft., where it had stopped. As
a matter of fact, getting word on the 11th that the
bore was up 80ft., Mackay’s office sent the news
along to the Herald, which published it same day,
and the news that 88ft. had been reached and driv-
ing resumed,” was in the next morning s papers, bo
James Mackay’s office gets its character cleared, in-
cidentally, The Bulletin’s most ancient Vie. min-
ing contributor throws in the unsolicited testimonial
that “Mackay is a straight legal manager, who will
have a straight mining manager, and hes one ot the
few who won’t stand the repression of news.*
“Alphonse Parbleu”: There are expecta-
tions that a Sydney co. will work the magnesite de-
posits of New Caledonia, which, with the exception
of certain deposits in Greece, are said to be about the
only large stores of this substance known at present.
Magnesite is a peculiar-looking mineral, half chalk,
half meerschaum, but heavy and hard. When put
through incinerators the stuff pans out a ton of mag-
nesite to about 2J tons of “stone” the pure stuff
having the appearance of a bluish-white jelly 01
blane-mange. This is worth anywhere from £4 10s.
a ton upwards. But there are various by-products,
including carbonic acid gas, which is of good com-
mercial value. The show itself consists of 400 or
500 acres, near the bay of St. Vincent, and is held
under lease from the French Government. G. A.
Lawson has recently reported on the property, and
after putting down numberless shafts, he reckons over
a million tons in sight. Magnesite has many mar-
kets; it is used in the composition of certain lire
bricks; Epsom salts are made from it; and it
furnishes a white ware, polished and smooth as line
enamelled porcelain. One way and another, there is
a large and growing demand for* it. #
When the Mount Jasper directors took
over the option on the Mount Stewart mine, everyone,
wondered why German hands had withdrawn their
grip from this Tasmanian show. But the bulk assay
of the ore explains the Teuton’s flit—copper, 0.247
p.c.; lead, 4.494 p.c.; zinc, 16.28 p.c.; gold, 13
grains, and silver 5910 z. per ton. This delectable
mixture, despite the silver, isn’t going to fill -Jasnn-
pockets with anything except cheap scrip and can
notices. „ .

The Tasmania, at Beaconsfield (Tas.), has
had a development at a depth of 1500 ft. A few days
since the crosscut was in 154 ft., and draining the
lode below the 1370 ft. level; since then they got lit.
of quartz, worth 14dwt., followed by 10ft. of rock
and 4ft. of quartz, a sample from which assayed
32idwt. Crushings have, however, never been any-
thing like the numerous good assays reported ftohY
this mine. A' run of 21 days in December gave a
mill' return* of 6050 z- from 3284 tons; but concen-
trates, residues, and the dismantling of an old mill

There is no official statement as to whether the mine
has paid its way lately. Monthly returns have some-
times looked good enough for a profit, but such a
large quantity of residual products has been treated
that it is difficult to form an opinion. *

“Will the undertaking pav?” The economical
handling and transport of ores, fluxes, coal, coke,
merchandise, etc.-, in or about mines, factories or
warehouses, very often solves the problem. W. and
J. Lempriere, of Melbourne, a's agents foT Bleicherf

Professor Richards, in the revised edition of bis
celebrated edition of “Ore Dressing,” 1909, devotes
14 pages to the Wilfley concentrating table, a™?
among other things, remarks (p. 1465) ; “The first
table sold was installed in the Puzzle Mill, at
Breekenridge, Colorado. Since then over 12,000
have been sold. This machine has revolutionised
ore-dressing, and as such is a phenomenal success.
The original form and forerunner of all modern
shaking tables with longitudinal riffles has been
greatly improved.” And further on (p. 1478) re-
marks: “One feature of the Wilfley table to which
especial attention should be called is its ability to
separate sands from slimes wliihf making the ordinary
concentration. This separation is more complete
and thorough than can be made by any classifier,
and should be taken advantage of in designing
mills.” In the last extensive additions made to the
treatment plant at the Golden Horseshoe Mine,
W.A., a large number of Wilfley Table Concentra-
tors were installed. The Austral Otis Engineering
Company, Limited, South Melbourne, have the sole
manufacturing rights.* #

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, January 29, 1912.
My Dear Arini, —
Anniversary Day in N.S.W. (January
2b) is one of the handiest pegs in the State
tor a man with a wad of notes and reminis-
cences and a retrospective habit in his grey
matter. On it he can conveniently hang
either well-preserved or moth-eaten anec-
dotes, from dawn till 11 p.m. or thereafter,
and none shall dare to yawn audibly. The
Australasian Pioneers’ Club hurled the
usual obituary notice at the Governor
Phillip statue. Secretary George Harris
stuck to the historic bones of the little
sailor s descent on this isle, but a man who
poised on the outer leaf of the Pioneers’
wreath party in Palace Gardens tells me he
escaped with all his anniversary dates up-
side down. A blurred impression that Presi-
dent D. H. Johnston (one of the speakers) had
personally discovered Phillip, and founded
Sydney, the British Empire and the Pio-
neers Club immediately afterwards, made
my acquaintance retire from the floral tri-
bute. memorial in disorder. He went away
to dive into the human age limit, and other
problems.
• A , n ,4 nniversary Ray Regatta on this
city s blue water front stirs up the pure
merino anecdote to its profoundest after-
lunch flicker. The Omrah, as flagstaff for
last week’s great sail and yarn revival, was
hlled to the scuppers with spectators at Is.
a head. Sailing events started at 10 a.m.
By tour in the afternoon they had ceased to
be events, and were old inhabitants dodder-
ing round the green islets of Sydney’s hand-
some bay, or loafing home on the lee side of
a catspaw from the nor’-east. Sometimes a
motor-boat foamed through the lazy fleet,
lhe wild uproar of a row-boat race incited
a mariner in a flag-trimmed craft to fire off
a small gun, and then poke it violently in
its stomach presumably fop disorderly con-
duct. A cargo steamer coming up the Har-
bor loitered unawares into the middle of the
sailing events at some suspected crisis in
their career, and apologised profusely (for
meddling with history). It retired, blushing,
into some hole or another, and hid itself till
after dark.
The Regatta lunch saloon emptied its im-
portant toast . list on the Omrah’s upper
planks some time before 3 p.m. Governor
Chelmsford and the new A.D.C. de Moleyns
(not nearly so new-looking as he was three
months ago) passed through the throng with
a long tail of committee men at their heels,
lhe recently imported de Moleyns, by the
way, has grown a healthy brown coat of
Australian tan on his now-acclimatised
complexion. It blushed a Moss Vale sun-
burn under the brim of an up-country felt
hat. “The I)ay we Celebrate” was nobly
supported with blue-ribbon streamers and
button-hole bouquets (like young cabbage
plants) on the bosoms of the Regatta com-
mittee. The benign smile of Judge Back-
house had expanded to a benediction. North
feydney’s Mayor Milson, an Anniversary
Dav waterman of note, trod the Omrah’s
Quarter-deck like an Admiral of the Red,
White and Blue after annihilating the de-
fences of Fort Denison and the Regatta lun-
cheon. Another youthful, clean-shaved face
—•that of Sydney’s acting-Mayor Milner
Stephen—was in evidence. Someone with
an U] exasperating memory for dates
coldly remarked in recent print that
Milner Stephen was more than 30. He
looked rather less in the after-glow of an
official toast-list. A new municipal by-law
to suppress birthdays (after the age of 30)
would clothe the Stephen head with a halo
that would even exceed a beer-barrel for
size, and allow a rejuvenated citizen to re-
main as young as he looked.
The Queen’s Club Co., Ltd., is now float-
ing round the corner of Macquarie-street
and Queen’s Square. It used to be the
lowers in the days when the Suffering
Rich (feminine gender) were clubless in
this city. There are other women’s clubs on
these shores, but they are either full of poli-
tics or resound with meetings for the up-
lifting of the mental outlook. The Queen’s
Club is frankly intended for the Idle Rich.
It is in the throes (as I write) of having its
windows finally cleaned and its scraps—odd
strips of stuff left over from the debris of
the Great Furnishing—removed. Its base-
ment kitchens are cool and spacious, with
a suite of pantries in attendance. Its car-
pets are mostly green Tile (they live on
velvet who reside here), though the dining-
room riots in rich shades of russet brown.
The Queen’s Club * card-room has no pat-
tern on the walls to distract the players’
attention from the rules of the game. An
electric lift from the lower regions conveys
nourishment to the round oak tables in the
dining-room. Its bedrooms will be luxur-
ious nests for the Residential Rich—chiefly
wayfarers to the city from the wool and
wheat belts. And its shares are sold out.
The entrance fee is four guineas and the
aunual sub. three guineas. Compared to
the single bedrooms (or condemned cells) of
many fashionable hotels, the Queen’s Club
will give both quantity and quality in its
handsome, oak-framed sleeping apartments.
I here s only one really small room, where a
slim spinster will fit in nicely.
Miss Living, the bright and breezy secre-
tary of this new refuge for the Destitute
Lieh, is a sister of the capable woman who’s
sec. and manager of the Alexandra Club in
Melbourne. Though the Towers is built
rather after the design of a step-ladder,
much walking upstairs is said to be reducing
to the waist-line. The male visitor, who’s a
friend or belonging of a member, will not
only be tolerated on the premises, he’ll be
encouraged. Mrs. Arthur Allen, Mrs. Bur-
dekin, Mrs. Harry Osborne, Mrs. E. Mere-
wether and Mrs. Gordon Wesche are on a
large committee. The Edmund Barton
dame is president.
Concerning the Women’s “Liberal” Con-
ference now clawing the air in Hobart, I’m
/qa \ .„ e brisk ton g u e of Grace Watson
t S.A.) will be lifted up in those parts by
proxy.. That indefatigable shepherd of con-
servative lives who stray from the ballot
paper when it’s blue in the land is re-
ported to have a huge work on hand, and
by reason of the multitude and the clatter
of it the Tower of Babel will have to take
a back seat, and the Kilkenny cats will
retire from business and apply for the old
age pension. The idea is to cement the Aus-
trahan women’s political organisations
( Liberal brand) with the General Feder-
ation of U.S. women’s clubs, which influ-
ences . a million or so of the emancipated
American ladies who live in flats and feed
their husbands on tinned food. If this
feminine torrent roars over the Common-
wealth with the anticipated ferocity, organ-
iser Grace Watson will hand out life-saving
apparatus to the male electors, and mere
man will swim for his life.
Your old friend. Akenelii sends along a
tew travel notes picked up in odd corners
of the map. “At Cairo we heard for the
hrst time of the wreck of the Delhi. Our
dragoman told us about it. He was deeply
interested in the escape of the royalties, for
it was he who had been deputed to lead the
Ducal Fifes through the land of sand
and ruin and goats. ‘Was the Fife party
drowned also?’ I asked him, for at first we
thought that most of the passengers had
<rml n No, madame,’ replied our guide,
ihey were mercifully preserved for me to
take up the Nile.’
. “ A t Port Said, we” r“we” in this connec-
tion signifies Mr. and Mrs. W. Macleod]
‘boarded the Macedonia for Aden. The
steamer seemed deserted when we arrived.
Her passengers were exploring Port Said, or
had entrained for Cairo. I was leaning over
the rail near the top of the gangway, when
I became aware that Something was about
to happen. Six or seven of the ship’s offi-
cers made a little lane of themselves. Then
English officer (very ‘ranky,’ if one can
judge by clothes and a parti-colored ribbon
on. his wide breast) and a really distin-
guished-looking, perfectly turned-out, grey
man came along. The latter was the Fife
himself—-the dukiest-looking ‘your Grace’
I’ve ever seen.
“The lane, or alley, then waited for the
I rincess Royal and her daughters. She
came nervously and gently out from the
cabin and shook hands, in the same gentle,
nervous manner, with the lane and with any :
one else in sight. The Egyptian officer (he
might have been French, though he wore a
fez) bowed over the royal fingers and grace-
fully kissed portion of them. The ship’s
officers took the Hand in an awkward Eng-
lish way, as if they feared it was going to
pick their pockets. The late king’s eldest
daughter is a very pale, almost painfully
slender, delicate, young-looking woman. Her
eyes are good, her face narrow, and her
nose long. She looks eminently likeable
and gentle, as if she never gave Duff a min-
ute’s nagging in her life. A grey felt hat of
the soft, bashed variety, with a navy-blue
ribbon bow, and a long, dark, by-no-means
new coat, made up the Fife lady’s outer
garb. Behind her trailed two rather em-
barrassed-looking girls. They were just like
any 20 Sydney girls as one sees them pour-
mg out of a Pitt-street commercial college
at 5 p.m. The eldest princess looked nearly
as old as her mother. The second daughter
was a jolly, brown-eyed girl at whose
rather gauche handclasps the younger sailors
hung out the red flag. It colored the backs
of their necks even, and probably their very
scalps blushed, if one only knew.”
What the returned crowning-uproar visi-
tors didn’t see when they perambulated the
kerbstones of the Great Fog, would fill
several columns of print apiece. Generally
not speaking, it never escapes their clenched
teeth, though they prattle prettily enough
about kings, queens and garters. A post-
card to a Sydney chum, from a mere young-
ster, Miss Heather Keep, who is still gad-
ding abroad with her parents, the Ernest
Keeps (chiefly of Melbourne, but well
known here), is a refreshing change. It’s
indexed, “Ali I saw of the Coronation.”
All is mapped out in service blue which
clothes the large legs of a London policeman.
A small child, making frantic efforts to
peer through his calves, indicates the gen-
eral public in the late melee.
Mr. “Cam” Walker, who’s reputed to be
heir to the Walker whisky millions, is alleged
to be engaged to Miss Ramsay, a Mel-
bourne girl. This news ought to fall with
a dull thud on the inner consciousness of
Sydney girls who sharpened not their
arrows in time. Musical comedy is the flame
which attracts one type of local gilded moth;
the residue are acquiring a habit of float-
ing off with damsels from Victorian or other
Australian tribes. Undergraduate Camp-
bell Walker (in the intervals when he
wasn’t imbibing learning at the Sydney
Medical School) has been living at Kogarah,
adjacent. to this township. His vast pros-
pective income, his many motor-cars and
his various chauffeurs, will eventually be
laid at the feet of the Victorian maiden
whose elders belong to the firm of Ramsay
and Fraser. The Fraser half, by the way,
used to live at Darling Point.
The elder son of Editor Ward, of Sydney
Telegraph, is obviously of those who sit
on the lap of the gods and find it a well-
cushioned resort for aspiring young men.
Ward, junior, has recently snatched from
all competitors the comfortable nest of Gov-
ernment Geologist in S.A. The living is
worth £BOO a year. Mrs. Ward, junior, has
come into a pleasing money-fall, and is
likely to acquire another bank vault or so,
later on. A younger Ward, who recently
caught a Rhodes scholarship with both
hands, is gaining flesh in the usually ener-
vating air of Oxford. So the House of
Ward seems to resound with glad tidings.
Richard Arnst, the world’s sculling cham-
pion, has sufficiently recovered from a recent
attack of hospital in Sydney to get married.
The bride was a nurse in the place where
Richard was docked for repairs after a col-
lision with some ruffians at Manly.
Why is some voracious monster —a raging
motor car, a pestilence or man-eating shark
—always lying in wait for the son of a
widowed mother? The good son, of course.
The tragedy of Lane Cove River, last week,
can only be draped by the pious with the ven-
erable theory, “inscrutable workings of Pro-
vidence.” The subsequent capture and
slaughter of the suspected shark, and his
earnings as a side-show (£2l-odd) on be-
half of the mother, are an unusual feature
m the case. No doubt it was the wrong
shark that was captured, for things always
pan out amiss. And, possibly, he was the
only support of a toothless fish-parent, or
had a large family to maintain, and was on
his way home with the groceries under his
fin when trouble came upon him.
The English press is now ilustrating a
new and complete machine for washing
away insomnia. This invention has recently
been perpetrated by a British woman, Mrs.
Cornwall. It’s a fearsome looking appara-
tus which distributes a ripple of water or
“medicated fluid” over the sufferer’s brow.
The Sleeper Who Is Awake lies on his
back with a large tub under his head to
catch the overflow. . A pipe, from a tank
stream above, crawls round his neck like
the serpent of old Nile, and halts on his
forehead, on which it delivers its soothing
contents. . And, presumably, when he gets
tired of lying on his back, and turns over in
his sleep, he promptly strangles himself with
the pipe, and his dead body falls into the
tank, and he either sleeps for ever or else
wakes up in a better (or worse) land. Just
now, some naturalists are struggling with
the question: “Does the African elephant
ever sleep in his wild state.” So far, he
has been so wild in his wild state that no
one has been able to blow into his ear and
find out. Perhaps this invention would do
something for him.
Letters of indignation have revolved round
the hatpin—its length, stabbing power and
general “cussedness”—-for some months, in
tLe daily press.. The uprising of the City
Council, which intends to hurl hew by-laws
at any sharp projection on the feminine hat,
is a New Year greeting to the majestic mil-
linery of the hour. Hatpins have outgrown
their proper place over the cranium, and
deserve to be severely spoken to, and they
ought to be banished to some municipal
Hades,. in company with the male stick
(when it whips the air in congested streets),
or the umbrella carried half mast under the
armhole.
Mrs. Bert Levy, who carefully contrives to
obliterate her light in the reflected blaze of
her husband’s success, was formerly a Miss
Waxman, of Melbourne. The Waxman
family runs to brains, and one brother, who
wandered into the Great Fog, made a name
as Albert Whelan, an inimitable mimic and
well-known vaudeville entertainer. In his
early, semi-professional days, “the Belle of
New York” was raging in Australia, and
Oscar Girard spent part of his time dying
and the rest playing Ichabod Bronson.
Suddenly, one night, he got so busy dying
that he had no time to play Bronson, and
Albert Whelan took his place. By way of
a whim, perhaps, he gave the audience
Girard’s Bronson, and the imitation was so
good that very few knew the difference.
Mrs. Levy is an accomplished pianist,
amongst other things, but it’s the other
things that matter. She shrinks from the
public eye with a persistence that is the hall-
mark of nearly every clever woman who’s
been behind the success of a son or hus-
band.
A pair of brown velvet eyes, a capable-
looking head, beautifully groomed with
sleek braids of dark hair, and an extraor-
dinarily “alive” manner, with a soft edge
that takes off the rasp with which the over-
strenuous woman sometimes grits her com-
pany. That’s Mrs. Bert Levy, if you throw
in a . plump, young-looking, “mothery” per-
sonality. She’s artist-entertainer Bert
Levy’s best asset, and he knows it.
“She’s my business manager, friend, pri-
vate secretary and stage manager. In
N’York she lives in her hat most of the
time, when I’m showing at two matindes
every day but Sundays. By the way, my
wife is my call-boy, and a few other things
I’ve forgotten to mention. She’ll never men-
tion it,” muses the returned Levy, discussing
his best investment. “She rings the cur-
tain up herself, and rings it down; she’s
on the stage behind all the time I’m show-
ing in front. If there’s a light at the back that
oughtn’t to be there—even a match makes a
conflagration near a dark screen scene —-
she’s on the spot to get rid of it. It’s not
my business capacity—l haven’t any—it’s
hers that’s pulled me to the front. It’s the
everlasting she, and as she happens to be
my wife, I’m a lucky man.”
Ola Humphrey, who has parted for quits
from her bland Egyptian prince, was, when
last heard of by wandering Cornstalks, busy
plucking the holly berry of peace in the
U.S. with her mother. After a quiet Christ-
mas, Ola was engaged to appear under her
native Stars and Stripes, in a one-act drama
at an incredible paper’ salary She w”
billed as Princess Hassan, of course.
lmportance,” now drift-
mg oft the Palace Theatre play-bill, is dressy
and talky with one big dramatic situation in
four acts But the talk is generally br 1
liant, and flashes a hard, white light round
the drab existence (generally garbed in trail-
ing biack velvet) of the Woman Who Didn't
Matter. In spite of a youthful lapse, she is
the best and dullest feminine in the piece
Mrs. Arbuthnot is one of the most effective
pieces of acting Mrs. Brough has done for
some time.
Oscar Wilde made the martyr-Woman of
iNo Importance too heavy to be an artistic
puppet m stage craft, and he carved out as
wooden a little prig in the American damsel
Hester Worsley, as Anthony Trollope could
have created in his worst moments The
youth and charm of Lizette Parkes save this
young person from being an unmitigated
bore, litheradge, the lion of the play bill,
Beatrice Day, and Valentine Sidney have
most of the fat of W ilde's witty conversa-
tional sallies. Valentine Sidney’s delightful
part of Lady Hunstanton is merely Mrs
Nickleby up to date. Wilde, bv the way, re-
laxes his Y W.C.A. grip on the lines of Mrs.
Arbuthnot for an instant, and gives her one
smart repartee. “Who was your visitor
mother, dear?” s the tame son (Wilde
handled lead wlu i he created this good
young man). “Oh, only a Man of No Im-
portance!” A simple definition of a titled
cad.
Marie Narelle’s new husband, Mr. Harry
Currie, is electrical engineer for the New
York Central Railway system. He’s said to
be one of the most scintillating persons in
his special line in the U.S. As second in
command of the electric spark which is
flashing through the New York end of the
permanent way, engineer Currie has the
task of keeping the trains going night and
day, while he puts the electric-motive power
where the old steam boiler used to hiss. The
wedding occurred in N’York city on Decem-
ber 9, and the honeymoon wandered
through Bermuda’s spicy breezes.
Plurried word drops in that manager
George Portus shows no immediate signs of
taking a larger size in hats, though he
secured, from all bidders, the Eleanora de
Cisneros concert attraction for Australasia.
The star will rise over the rim of this town
in June.

Is the Ideal Home Piano.
What the Pianola Piano will mean in your home:
It WiS j#an. that you can have music—the best of music—whenever you want
It will mean that you will always have an ever-ready means of entertaining
friends.
It will mean a constantly growing familiarity with an abundance of beautiful
music you may not at present even realise is in existence.
It will mean an important educational factor for the children —a method of
making them familiar with the world s great composers, thus supplying a deficiency
in the educational system of most schools.
It will mean that you can familiarise yourself with the grand operas that are
to bo sung this season by Madame Melba’s Grand Opera Co., in advance or then
production, or it will keep you in touch with the successes of the comic-opera stage.
And above all. it will mean that, instead of just listening to music, you can play it.
No one can tell you the tremendous fascination of producing music. You must
experience it yourself. And, when you do, you will realise for the first time in your
life you are learning what musical enjoyment is. The STECK Pianola Piano,
haying a Pianola inside its case, may be played by anyone. The presence of the
Pianola, however, does not interfere with the piano’s use for hand playing and
practice.
IMPORTANT. —If you have reached the point where music in the home seems
essential to the happiness of the family, do not make the mistake of supposing that
there are other instruments just about as good as the PIANOLA PIANO.
Only at Pianola Hall can you obtain the PIANOLA and STECK or STEIN-
WAY PIANOLA PIANOS.
Other firms have other players, for which extravagant claims are made, but the
PIANOLA continues everywhere to be regarded as the STANDARD. It is the
only instrument of the kind which has the hearty support of the musical world,
and which is bought by the most discriminating class of purchasers here and abroad.
Let us send you one of our catalogues. We will send it free if you will write us. Ask
for Catalogue C;
Full Value Allowed for Slightly Used or Second-hand Pianos as part payment on a STEINWAY or STECK PIANOLA PIANO.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, January 29, 1912.
My Dear Yabrie, —
Squatter A. J. Black, of Mount Noorat,
who was killed in a motor smash, was
awarded the usual rich man’s share of post
mortem praise by the papers. He inherited
the great wealth and stepped into the place
of his father—a man of considerable force
of character. Having a lot of money, he
had a great regard for it; and the hard-
working people whose cows grazed on his
broad acres helped him to more. Years ago,
one of his sharesmen, who had grown tired
of milking early and late, started to think
out a. machine which would do the slavery
for him. He kept at the idea until he
had knocked it into shape. Now Gillies’
goes everywhere, and the affluent
Scotch inventor looks back kindly on the
toilsome days and nights and says: “Per-
liaaps he’s. no so Black as he was painted,”
thus combining a Scotch joke with an epi-
taph. “Black should have stuck to his
horses,” say his squatter friends who knew
his skill with the live, hoofed motors. This
is the second tragedy among the dan, for
a brother went down with the lost Waratah.
He was to have been married on his return
to Melbourne. The fatal journey was un-
dertaken to collect some furniture for his
Australian home, which shows that it is
best to buy Australian furniture every
time.
The youthful Walker who has just got en-
gaged to Miss Mary Ramsay, daughter of
the Robert Ramsays, of Brighton, is a mem-
ber of the great whisky-distilling firm of
that name. It is an ancestor of his who
looms so large on the posters in various
sporting characters. He has lately returned
from Scotland with two immense motors in
his carpet bag, and is said to keep the wolf
a respectable distance from the door with an
income of £6OOO a year.
Peter Schuler is sprinting over to Syd-
ney for a holiday. The Innes-Noads, with
fiancee Joan, have a house at Narrabeen,
where the tumbling surf is not too crowded.
The large and cheerful family of squatter
Graves has come down from the Western
District and is banked up in a city tavern
whilst searching for a vacant spot on the
crowded sea front. “House full!” seems to
be the cry all the way from Brighton to the
Heads. The Graves’ squattage, Mount Bat-
tery, is set in the bed of an ancient sea, and
has plenty of rocks and shells. Their present
need, however, is a modern, damp sea fitted
with sharks, jellyfish and all the latest an-
noyances.
Somebody who lately beheld the lady who
used to be Ruby Wallace rhapsodises in ink
about her dressing. The writer who wit-
nessed her in a smart London caf<s, says that
she was wearing a long, black velvet cloak
with a skunk’s fur collar. (The dictionary
asserts that some fur dealers avoid men-
tioning the unpleasant animal by selling its
overcoat as “Alaska sable.”)
State Governor Fuller is having his turn
at Coombe Cottage. He and his lady week-
ended at the retreat as the guests of Melba.
The Denmans had the use of the empty cage
whilst the singer was absent in Sydney.
A Toorak matron, who had kept her well-
drilled staff of maids together for a whole
18 months, lately decided to take a trip to
foreign parts, and let her house. She added
as an extra inducement in her ad. that the
servants would like to keep their present
quarters. A man, who is to be married
shortly, dashed at the chance to secure the
ready-to-work establishment, and opened
negotiations. In the meantime, the sister of
Mrs. Toorak suddenly contracted a matri-
monial engagement, and secured the girls for
herself. A discussion over the legality of
the sister’s move is now in full blast. It
may even be taken to court to cool down.
Millionaire squatter T. J. O’Loughlin, of
Killarney, Warrenheip (the hill country
outside Ballarat), is back in Australia with
a new bride. She was- Miss Murphy, of
Ballybur Castle, and comes of one of the
oldest families in Ireland. O’Loughlin went
to Ireland to marry her, and the pair honey-
mooned on the Continent, returning to Aus-
tralia by way of America. They brought
three motor-cars wjth them. One of the
machines is a present for Bishop Higgins,
of Ballarat. The city got up on its poppet
heads and statues to welcome the couple
home; also, it put arches and flags in their
way, and whooped and shouted regardless of
cost; for the generous groom has built
churches and hospitals, and generally broad-
casted much money. The Catholic ladies
gave a reception in the evening to Mrs.
O’Loughlin. The bride, who is saucily
pretty, floated into the room in a gown of
beautiful cream lace. She wears her hair in
simple Madonna fashion, parted over her
forehead and coiled in a big, loose knot on
her neck. Robinson Snowball and Dill
Macky will be delighted to hear that her
husband was made a count or something by
the Pope.
A popular Melbourne medico, who is re-
garded as an incurable bachelor, was fish-
ing at Lome with a choice assortment of
girls grouped about him. A watchful matron
remarked tartly: “Yes, the doctor is always
popular with the girls; he is so indiscrim-
inate with his attentions.” A summer girl,
perched on the verandah rail, chipped in
with: “Yes, he’s a dear! But he doesn’t
plav for keeps.”
Alan Currie, who was pitched out of his
car, but escaped unhurt, was chief pall-
bearer to the motor-slain A. J. Black.
Ruby Hanby, eldest daughter of Colonel
Hanby, is to utter the fatal words at pic-
turesque St. Andrew’s Church, Middle Brigh-
ton, on February 6. The intended victim is
Harry Hawkswood, of this city.
Gertie, eldest girl of Town Clerk Clayton,
and Aylwin Leslie, of Brighton, have been
and got engaged. As they .are popular young
people, a great wave of congratulation is
rolling their way.
Rev. F. Brown, the new head of the Gee-
long Grammar. School, has arrived in Mel-
bourne with his spouse and progeny. While
teaching the young idea to sprout, he will
learn Australia and the Australians.
The stately Dalrymple dame has carried
off daughter Mollie to Colombo to recruit,
after a stubborn attack of measles.
A well-known Melbourne man steamed Fog-
ward last year to. have the knot tied. When
his friends met him on his return, they were
astonished to hear that the bride was not
with him.
A couple of Toorak young men, of the
much-moneyed class, are to get a free trip
to Europe with the Australian eight. Sen-
ator Fraser’s eldest son is one of the lucky
pair. The other is Harry, third of the
widow Ross-Soden’s group of four.
The Edward Yenckens are going Thames-
ward once more, the spending of their
riches in foreign places being a chronic
weakness with the Yencken family.
Grandma Yencken is one of Melbourne’s
evergreens. She takes the air each day in a
victoria, out of which she steps like a
frisky two-year-old when lured by a bargain
sale.
Up till now, the Block parade has not
been devastated by the absence of Ernest
Brooks and his smile. He postponed his
passing to Europe until the sacrifice of his
household gods was completed.
The Admiral Bridges returned by the Or-
sova, and the Hunter Landales, who have
been keeping the town house free from the
moth that doth corrupt, are seeking a new
humpy. Mrs. Bridges is a niece of the late
Samuel Wilson—the ambitious, red-whis-
kered knight, who married a couple of his
progeny into the blessed peerage before he
departed this life.
The. Agar Wynne family were recently
expecting the G.-G., with a stray help or so
in attendance, to pay them a visit at their
place. However, Denman could not manage
it, and had to wire his regrets. Whereat
the youthful members of the family went
out and sighed bitterly 458 times.
Mrs. Charles Cadden is back in Melbourne
from, her visit to daughter Queenie, now
married to an English mummer by name
Lennard. She stayed for four years. This
was the Cadden widow’s seventh voyage, and
very nearly her last. The occupant of the
bunk above hers was, in a sense, a fallen
woman. That is to say, she fell one night,
bunk and all, on to the recumbent form of
Mrs. Cadden, and, when the shrieks and
splinters had cleared off, and the lady from
above had ceased to rebound on her pros-
trate prey, the latter was found to be some-
what surprised and squashed. All this
trouble could have been avoided by a margin
of 12 months if she had extended her visit
to five years.
Coincidences seem to hover about Cap-
tain Guy Gaunt, of the Challepger. Dur-
ing a recent tour of America, he indulged
in a game of polo; but, being disabled, he
retired from the field, and a substitute took
his place. Later the papers referred to
the substitute as “Captain Guy Gaunt.”
The correctness of the report was questioned ;
but the injured captain’s own officers were
positive that he had played throughout the
game. Inquiries were made, and it was
discovered that the substitute’s grand-
mother’s maiden name was Gaunt; also,
that a section of the Gaunt family had
migrated to America. The two distant
cousins were ridiculously alike. No. 2
coincidence was that the captain purchased
an old estate in England, and, on signing
the deeds, discovered that the place had
been called Gauntswood over 200 years
before. It turned out that it had been one
of the family seats.
A Collins-street dentist lately bought him-
self a motor-boat, and started up the Yarra.
He discovered (with his nice new boat) that
the stream is a mixture of water and wood—
the wood part being represented by about
45,000,000 uncharted snags. Now the young
toothsmith sits and cusses, whilst his partner
attends to all the fine work. He knocked
his hands about so badly, whilst getting the
craft off the obstructions, that he is tempo-
rarily unable to tackle business himself, and
can only give his moral support. The motor-
boat is for sale. He says he would rather
go sailing in a timber yard than start up
our wooden creek on another jaunt.
There are plenty of aviators in Melbourne
these times. Cugnet wanders the streets
with a far-horizon gaze, and Mack, of Aus-
tralia, perches at times in the topmost parts
of the tall Equitable. Hammond and his
wife are at the Grand, and other high-fliers
are approaching specks on the horizon. The at-
traction is the proposal of the Federal Gov-
ernment to appoint three or four instructing
aviators. The airmen are going to try and
persuade Defence Minister Pearce to make
the attached salaries soar a bit above £4OO
—the figure mentioned.
A handsome parson has bought a house
on one of the bay beaches, where the mad-
ding policeman goes but seldom and the
grandmotherly ban on mixed bathing has
been utterly forgotten. He wears an impress-
ive bath robe to his dip, and the pretty bath-
ing caps of the household are generally visi-
ble w r hen he is braving the sharks. They are
a happy gathering, especially on the rare
warm days of this wayward summer.
A romance, which commenced with the gift
of a mustard plaster, will shortly end at the
altar. Two nice girls, who occupied a tent a
little removal from a clump of can-
vas habitations, were disturbed and
worried by the incessant coughing of
a male camper. At last, one of them
flung on a kimono, and, grabbing a tin
of mustard, started out to render first aid.
Hot coffee and more plasters staved the main
trouble off, and the seaside doctor, wffio
arrived with rumpled hair in the grey morn-
ing hours, did the rest. After all, true ro-
mance is based on the homely things of life,
and a tin of mustard is worth more than
many boxes of chocolates.
On Saturday afternoon, the P. and O.
people gave an At Home on board the Bal-
larat, their new twin-screw boat. About
2000 people rushed the chance of free food,
and the special trains to Williamstown were
packed like sheep trucks. Three gangways
were swarmed by the guests, who charged
past the half-dozen shipping officials on the
pier who had intended to do the receiving.
By the time the hosts managed to scramble
aboard, they found the guests had made
themselves quite at home, and had poured
into every corner. Cargo was being hoisted
aboard at the time, and the stevedores were
so flustered by the rush that a sling of
sheep carcases dropped overboard and floated
about in the bay like a drowned butcher’s
shop. Afternoon tea was taken sharkwise
in the huge dining saloon of the ship by the
unwieldy crowd.
“Maids?” said the registry-office keeper,
briskly. “No, I haven’t one in the place.
Look at that roomful of women there !” (She
jerked her head towards a melancholy apart-
ment, decorated with a few withered pot
plants, and filled with wistful Marianne-
hunters.) “All that lot are waiting on the
off-chance of seeing two that said they might
drop in again! There was a lady here yes-
terday nearly frantic; she said her family
had lived on tinned meat since the end of
last year, and were desperate. No, I didn’t
ask if she had never learnt cooking—that
would have been cruel. Nobody likes the
sort of girl we are sending out; but that
isn’t our fault —we can’t get any other sort.
The general cry is, ‘I must get help of some
kind! Anything will do provided it can
wash up—an old woman, or a cripple, or a
lunatic —so long as it isn’t absolutely homi-
cidal. If there is no lunatic available, send
us an immigrant—but not before you are
dead sure there is no lunatic.’ ” This state-
ment lowers the stock of the im-
ported dish-smasher considerably. Mean-
while, the small suburban family, that
should be the hope of the country, stores
the Chinese-made furniture and the cradle,
and helps to fill some cheap boardinghouse,
where the young wife gets lazy and gossipy,
and her consort, deprived of his lawn-mower
and fowl-run, contracts the club habit, and
lays on fat.
A friend says she knows of an original
charlady who, after working furiously all
day. indulges at night in physical-culture
exercises to keep herself fit for her toil. It
looks rather like gilding the refined washtub
and painting the bluebag; but she vouches for
the truth of the statement, and is prepared
to tell your Speaker Willis so if he doubts it.
Maybe the artist in line and wash juggles
the clubs and bells to straighten her poor
bent back.
Artist Mather and his wife have shifted
their easels and other furnishings to
their new villa on the Como estate,
Toorak. At a pinch, the residence
could easily be used as a shop, for
the front is mostly plate glass. The effect
is rather panefully new—but Art is nothing
if not original. Another hotfse on Como,
belonging to a medical man, seems to have
but one chimney-pot in its entire make-up.
Apparently the domicile is stove-warmed in
the winter, or gets its heat from radiators,
or maybe all the fireplace chimneys lead to
the lone, lorn chimney-pot.
“Hereditary distinction” is a deplorable
badge to hitch on to children, but it has its
incidental and innocent humorousness in
the nursery sphere of action. What time the
two McCormack nippers—Yvonne and Geof.
—were staying in Melbourne with mum and
pop (and afterwards with auntie), the vice-
regal Denham kiddies came occasionally to
help them frivol. One day a friend of the
family remarked to little Yvonne: “So, you
are going to have the Honorable Judith to
play with you to-day?” The damsel, noting
the reverent emphasis laid on the “Honor-
able,” opened her eyes and held her tongue,
but as soon as her distinguished visitor
arrived, she put the question which had been
worrying her young head: “Why do they
call you the horrible Judy?” Neither of the
McCormack hopefuls seemed to catch on to
Miss Judith’s honorable name. Whereas the
girl called her Judy, boy Geof. generally
addressed her as Judas.
Clara Butt got a gorgeous audience at
Pretoria during the recent tour. Governor-
General Gladstone gave a command night,
and practically all the uniforms in the place
turned up. Pretoria is just now stuffed with
military men. and, where the house didn’t
blaze like a burning warehouse, it glittered
like the head of a chemical blonde.
G.-G. Denman lately raked in a hundred
new subscribers for tile Kepertory Theatre
with one well-timed scoop of his cocked hat.
Whilst at the Wallaby Club, someone spoke
sympathetically of Gregan McMahon’s ven-
u-r?' Give. them practical sympathy,”
said his Lx. briskly, and straightway started
to canvass for support, with the above-
mentioned result. He has told McMahon
that hell do anything he can to help him in
the new quarters. The Repertory Theatre
appears to be looking up so much that it
will be lucky if it escapes getting a crick iu
its neck.
Someone appears to be doing good steal-
thily—or as stealthily as possible under the
circumstances. At the last three panto,
matinees, a company of blue-clad Brighton
orphans have shrieked their delight at the
glittering show. The contingents are made
up of about a dozen girls each time.
Evelyn Scotney, who, on the advice of
Melba, took her soprano voice to Paris a
couple of years ago, appears to be making
good. She sang at one of the Boston Opera
Co.’s concerts in the city of culture, and
the Boston Post and Herald bestowed upon
her the unstinted praise that brings grist to
the mill.
Balia Miranda is soon to be heard in
these parts again. She is coming out with
the Quinlah Opera Co., which commences
operations at Her Majesty’s, in May.
Marshall-Hall’s opera, “Stella,” is threat-
ened at Her Majesty’s, in April. It will
eventuate on two successive Saturday after-
noons, and will be run by the committee of
the Lady Northcote Permanent Orchestra.
Artist Bunny, as well as painting pic-
tures, writes dainty little songs, and several
of the species dedicated to various Toorak
hostesses are treasured as souvenirs of his
visit. The owners and their friends gusli
over the productions, though they have
great difficulty in reading them, for the
MS. is most artistically erratic. The
players have to plod as best they can
through the uncharted crochets and quavers.
The people who are working for the Gor-
don statue are circularising every national
society which looks strong enough to help.
At a recent meeting, someone proposed the:
Wattle Society as a likely source for sub-
scriptions. The chairman looked doubtful
until he found that the Wattlers are 1500
strong in Victoria alone. “Put it down,”
he said cheerfully. .
From “Rosna,” in London
There was a special service for Australians-in-
London this Christmas, and the High Commissioner
Reids and a few hundred other ’Roolanders packed
themselves into St. Dunstan’s-in-the-East, more from
a desire to see a few friendly Australian faces than
from religious fervor, I believe. St. Dunstan’s rector
was once St. Augustine’s nilot in Unley (S.A.) ; and
he and his choir served up portions of “The Messiah,”
the chief soloist being Adelaide warbler Arthur Otto,
now raising a tenor voice in London as Kingston
Stewart. When Australians foregather in London
they hang Mrs. Grundy, and don’t wait, for introduc-
tions, and so at the church door we fell in with
somebody’s rich uncle from Australia. He had been
standing there an hour looking for a familiar face.
After 40 years in the great Australian nor’west, the
awful loneliness of London was killing him, he said.
A few lines from Adelaide: —
The builders’ strike has declared a truce after last-.,
ing for over two months, employers having agreed to
pay the desired 10s. a day, pending a decision by the
Wages Board. About £150,000 worth of work has
been hung up all this time, and another quarter of a
million has been waiting in the architects’ offices to
be tendered for.
Dalgety and Co., in Adelaide, have had to do with-
out their head for four months past, E. W. van
Senden having got blood-poisoning in the shin, while
on a visit to Perth. He is back at work again
after a long convalescence, and congratulates himself
that the limb was just saved from amputation.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

WHAT TO DO
IN INDIGESTION.
<*.
Proper Treatment aims at
Strengthening the Stomach,
♦
Indigestion occurs when the
Stomach has become too
Weak to do its work.
There may be different reasons why the
stomach becomes weak and out of order, but
the result is always the same. A weak
stomach cannot digest food properly. The
Indigestion will persist until thfe stomach is
strong enough to do its own work. Laxa-
tives and pre-digested foods are only make-
shifts to get temporary relief. A great
many sufferers have been cured of severe
Indigestion by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.
They supply the stomach with the strength
it needs by enriching and purifying the
blood. Pure blood gives tone to the nerves,
muscles and glands of the stomach, and
makes it capable of properly performing the
work of digestion. The case of Mr. John
B. Rowen, of Balmoral, 33 Morehead Street,
Waterloo, Sydney, shows how good these
pills are in cases of Indigestion. Mr.
Rowen, who has now retired, was a railway
engineer for 29 years. He 'said :
‘‘My Indigestion trouble was brought on
in the first place by my eating my meals too
quickly. I would take a bite or so and be
working at the same time, and presently I
noticed severe pains coming on in my chest
soon after I had swallowed my food, and
my breast bone felt sore and tender. I could
hardly stand my waistcoat buttoned. Be-
tween the shoulder blades I felt the weighty
sore feeling, too. The food seemed to be
rising up in my throat like a hard ball, and
made me feel sick and wretched. I felt
much worse in hot weather. Sometimes I
was quite dizzy, everything seemed to swim
round me. I had to take a spell off work
every now and then for a day or so ; I felt
too sick to do anything. I had been ailing
like this for about three years, and tried
several doctors without getting any lasting
benefit. Then I read about Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills, and I sent to Pattinson’s and got
some. When I was half through the second
box I felt a shade better. Seven boxes quite
rid me of the Indigestion and toned up my
system in every way. I can strongly recom-
mend them, as they have made another man
of me.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are sold by
chemists and storekeepers, or sent by mail
on receipt of price, 2s. 9d. per box, six
boxes 15s. 3d., by the Dr. Williams’ Medi-
cine Co of Australasia, Ltd., Sydney.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Thus chairman A. J. Gould, at the half-
yearly meeting of the City Bank of Sydney:
Imports also were increasing, while the value of
exports was considerably less; and it needed no
financial prophet to tell that money in the near
future might be more difficult to obtain and cost
more. These things, however, affected the com-
munity generally, and not the City Bank specially.
And having noticed that “imports are in-
creasing,” etc. —as a result of a tariff that
isn’t high enough to stop them —and that
the circumstance is not altogether good for
his bank, not to mention the “community
generally,” presumably chairman Gould wifi
now explain eax-nestly to his friend Senator
Gould that neither Freetrade nor low tariffs
are of any account whatever.
“E.ACAV.”: Parties are so evenly balanced
in the M.L. Representatives that another
election shortly seems unavoidable. Neither
Ward nor Massey has any policy worth the
name ; they are simply anti-tlxe-other-fellow,
and are concerned only with their chances
of office. Robertson, the Socialist member,
will close the argument as far as he is con-
cerned by voting to empty out first one and
then the other; but if another election fol-
lows I reckon Robertson wifi lose his seat.
So wifi Payne, the free-lance Laborite who
beat ex-Minister Fowlds and has been rising
a shoe-horn to squeeze his hat on ever since.
The way I figure it is that a new party wifi
be formed from the Radical elements in the
Reps, and, in alliance with Labor, gradually
evolve into a Labor-Socialist combination.
But how it will miss Hogg, Fowlds and
“Tommy” Taylor, who was the ablest of
them all!
A CHANCE FOR FAME!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
So far, only 20 designs have been received by the
Home Affairs Department for planning the Federal
capital. There is still another week to go before the
term allowed to competitors to send in their pro-
posals expires.— Daily paper.
The oil that rolled down Aaron’s beard —-
Yea, even to the ground !
What time the tribe of Cohen cheered
And Levi stood around—
That sacred oil of bygone years
Rolled not so fast as fall our tears!
The blossoms and the lovely leaves
That perish in their pride—
Wherefor old Herrick sweetly grieves f
In poems that abide.
Those daffodils of vanished Springs
Caused not the grief this sad news brings! '
It tells us in cold, pulseless lines
That form a frozen par,
That only twenty odd designs
Have been “received” so far !
And adds with a pathetic shriek:
There's only left another week!
Ye Gods! AVhy is to us reserved
So harsh —so dark a fate?
What is our sin that we’ve deserved
This ignominy great ?
Another week ! And none has planned
The mightiest City of the Land !
Tyre, Babylon, Palmyra, Troy
And Carthage—where are they ?
White Athens —once the whole world’s joy—
With them has passed away!
Though, like a rock amid the foam,
Still stands the soaring pile of Rome!
The mighty cities of our time,
Like London and New York
And Paris —first in Art and Crime —
Chicago—-first in Pork !
One queenly sister lack—alas !
Our undesigned Canberra-Yass !
Ah, heavy grief! The Austral Land
In sorrow hides its face.
Comes there not forth at least One hand
Canberra’s lines to trace?
Vibrates there not one master-brain
To rear a Troy by Yass’s plain?

BEAUTILESS FIGURES.
SLIM SHAPELINESS RESTORED.
AVomen who are inclined to be plump
should he very watchful of themselves. A
certain degree of plumpness is not xvithout
its personal attractiveness, but it must not
be forgotten that this engaging fulness of
figure generally develops into positive stout-
ness. This fleshy increase is sometimes quite
sudden, and the figure soon becomes quite
beautiless. AATiatever the degree of the
obesity, the Marmola Prescription Tablets
present a reducing remedy of the highest
older. Containing in a solid condensed form
all the components of the celebi-ated Mar-
mola Prescription, these dainty tablets re-
stoi-e the slim shapeliness of figure so much
admired, also the pure facial lines and slen-
der mould of limb essential to beauty. At
the same time, the genei-al health is greatly
improved. The reducing process is both
pleasant and harmless, and in a very few
days thei-e is a feeling of relief and bodily
well-being which is delightful and exhilarat-
ing. When the brief treatment is termin-
ated, one feels quite a new being. The dose
is one tablet after each meal and one at bed-
time. Subcutaneous excess-fat is removed
without wrinkling or loosening of the skin.
Marmola Prescription Tablets are sold by
chemists, price 3/6, or, post free, of the
Marmola Company, 5 and 7 Barrack Street,
Sydney, N.S.W.*
Note —For those who prefer the liquid pre-
paration, chemistj', are still dispensing the
famous prescription as follows: —One ounce
of fluid Extract of Glycyrrhiza 8.P., one
ounce of pure Glycerine 8.P., one half-
ounce of Marmola. and mix ivith peppermint
water to make six ounces in all. The dose
is two teacvoonfuls after each meal.
Despite all the sensational cablegrams, it
is fairly safe to bet that the roaring Orange-
men of Ulster won’t fight against Irish Home
Rule. Orange societies have now existed for
117 years, and have done much shouting and
drinking of toasts. But, saving their feeble,
twopenny conspiracy to dethrone the young
Queen ATctoria, and put the Duke of Cum-
berland —then boss-Orangeman—on the
throne, they have done little hard work.
After that futile business —-it was so futile
that many people, even of that day, never
heard of it —their lodges were shut up. But
they resumed drinking toasts and shouting
in a furtive sort of fashion a few years
later.
THE PROTEST.
The Australian Government has decided to again
place the Referendum proposals before the electors.
THE STATE ANCIENT (to Australia, as Fisher
blows the whistle to set the keystone):
“Don't you help! Don't you help him!
He proposes to build out my light."
The N.S.W Goveimment found itself in
a weak position in the House of Landlords
last session, especially when the taxation
proposals came on. There are seven Minis-
ters in the Assembly, and each of them ap-
pears pallid with exhaustion after passing
lxis own little scrap of legislation through a
fairly responsive Chamber. But Flowers has
to master every Bill and put it through a
hostile Council. Then, as happened with a
recent taxation measure, he may be fooled
by the blunder of a Minister lower down.
Even if the Government intends to destroy
the Legislative Council, it must strengthen
its administrative powers and debating
power in order to do it. Its represen-
tation is a joke now—and liable to be a very
disastrous joke for the good man who is
bending under the strain of it.
GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS.
At the Labor Conference to-day, the South Aus-
tralian party submitted a proposal that where pos-
sible all articles required for Federal use should be
manufactured in the Commonwealth. The motto,
“Australia for Australians,” was enthusiastically ap-
proved by delegates. The mover agreed to the ad-
dition of the words, “Australian growth or manufac-
ture,” which means that where possible everything re-
quired by the Commonwealth should be the product
of Australians. The motion, as amended, was readily
accepted by the conference, and agreed to. —Daily
paper.
AUSTRALIA: “ After that choice bit of sentiment
what about making this the first plank of
the platform? ”
Opposition-leader Peake’s seat in the S.
Aus. Assembly is wobbling. His district re-
turns three membei’s, and two of them fox-
years past have been Laborites. Now the
Labor vote has been strengthened by the
Tailem Bend railway works which are in
progress thereabouts, and the “great I'beral
party” is in peril of having its head bitten
off by an infuriated blue pencil.
From a Sydney Telegraph interview with
an Australian just returned froin England
one Minell, a Sydney accountant:
The struggle for existence is terrible. The first
thing that strikes the Australian is the appallm 0
poverty and misery of the people. Ihis is paiticu-
larly applicable to the towns. You very rarelj see
the'average London people smile. They go about
with such a sad look—there is no lightness about
their nature as compared with the Continental
people. You very rarely see the little children smile
in the streets.
It recalls a French traveller’s account of
Poland in its last days, just before the Rus-
sians and their allies wiped out Knsciusko
and the rest of the slave-holders— It is 2UU
years since a Polish baby laughed.
AVhitaker’s Almanac, just to hand, sug-
gests a reason for the recent British rail-
way troubles. In 1910 the average wage of
the English railway men was 265. 3|d. per
week, which was fd.
less than in 1907.
Also, though the traf-
fic had increased very
greatly, there were
15,089 fewer men to
do the work. In Scot-
land the average wage
was 235. 3d., which was
2Jd. less than in 1907,
and there were 311
less employees to
handle a larger busi-
ness. Taking the U.K.
as a whole there were
15,671 fewer employ-
ees in 1910 than in
1907, and they were
each paid Id. a week
less, yet the railway
x-evenue had increased
by £2,500,000, and
the cost of living was
on the up grade. No
wonder the rank and
file —who get about
2s. a day, after the
engine-drivers, sta-
tionmasters and bet-
ter-paid employees are
provided for —didn’t
show all the “loyalty”
that was expected of
them.
AVhat stock-jobbers say isn’t of much con-
sequence to anybody ; but the papers always
lay hold of the remarks of their monthly
circulars when those remarks are even more
brazen than the papers care to make them-
selves. So this, by the incorrigible Pal-
mer firm in Sydney, has been given wide
circulation: —
That the Commonwealth Bank will involve the
people generally in serious los3 we have not the
least doubt, and the same will be the result of all
the Socialist experiments now- being indulged in by
the many Australian Governments.
Well, the railways are a “socialist ex-
periment,” and people like the Palmer firm,
wli ?n they want to show what a fine thing
borrowing is for the country, pour out figures
to show that the railways are coining so
much money that they are worth millions and
millions more than has been spent on them.
As a matter of fact, N. S. AVales railways
did show a surplus of £1,076,286 in the last
couple of years, after providing for all work-
ing expenses and interest; so, instead of this
particular experiment “ involving the people
generally in serious loss,” it relieved the
Palmer 'firm’s Fat friends of something over
a million of taxation.
If eventually the Victorian Government’s
efforts to run a State coal mine result in a
fiasco, and Wonthaggi returns to the howling
wilderness from which it sprang, as seems
just about possible, 10,000 priests and
apostles of Private En-
terprise will make a
babble of excited remarks
about the fatuity of
Socialistic efforts. Iu
point of fact, the AVon-
thaggi State mine is not
Socialistic; it is just a
State enterprise villain-
ously hampered by the
cunning resolutions of a
Legislative Council that
is always the inveterate
enemy of the State when
the State’s effort clashes
with the piratical
schemes of private deal-
ers. The AVonthaggi “So-
cialistic” coal mine must
not sell coal to ordinary
customers even in
tliaggi itself. If
thaggi customers want
coal they are compelled
to haul it from outside
sources. The Leg. Coun-
cil hobbled the industry
with this infamous res-
triction ; and valiant
John Murray and AVillie
AVatt, the democrat with
the yellow streak, permit
it to remain. Mean-
while, the conservative-
minded Railway Com-
missioners are handling
the mine much as a
European monarch might
handle a mysterious, tick-
ing package reasonably
supposed to be from an anarchist.

PROGRESS IN “THE EAST.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One of the leading officials at Changsha was asked
by the Reform party to join in the Chinese revolu-
tion. Though he sympathised with them, he said
that he considered the time was not ripe. The revo-
lutionaries thereupon killed him. —Sydney Telegraph
(26/l/’l2).
We sneer at China for her backwardness
In all that appertains to modern stress,
And class her as. a laggard in the strife
Which is a “Western” nation’s very life.
Vet, in our much-boomed white man’s land, folks
prate
Of old, dead causes, and reiterate
With madd’ning frequency the old, dead cries
(“The time’s not ripe” and such-like Tory lies).
And no one even smites them with a cuss.
So heathen China shows a point to us.
There, let such views be voiced but once, and straight,
The speaker’s butchered by an outraged State.
N.S.W.
10-2-4.
Victoria, which is such a consistent ex-
porter of its own young people, is to bring
in 14,000 immigrants at public expense this
year. Which will, at least, be an act of
kindness to Queensland. The immigrant
takes one wild look at the sort of legislation
imposed on Victoria by its House of Upper
Horribles, and then he generally flees for
the tropics, and John Weary’s State sees
him never more.
The N.S.W. Labor selections for the
Senate are Ike Smith, D. Watson and J.
Grant. The first is a well-known Western
organiser for the big A.W.U. He is no
orator, as Brutus was, or Billy' Hughes is;
but he is well liked, and is a good man for
the job. Grant is secretary of the N.S.W.
P.L.L., a hard Scotch stonemason, and a
bigoted Single-taxer. He holds advanced
views, but reduces everything to terms of
Henry George. He has a fatal knack of
saying things that cause trouble to his party ;
so that the less he says in the coming cam-
paign, the soonest mend.ed. D. AVatson is
the man who beat Peter Bowling for the
boss-ship of the Newcastle miners; a logical
and clever speaker, and a sterling man gen-
erally. On the whole, things might have
been worse; but Labor will have to fight
hard. The easy job of last election will not
be so easy, now that the people have nearly
got used to the Fusion.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The last of the Sheffield Shield matches
commenced between N.S.W. and Victoria, at Sydney
Cricket Ground, on Friday last. Warwick Arm-
strong captained the Weary team, and won the toss,
and Seitz and Kortlang took strike for Victoria, while
Cotter and Hazlitt laid on for Ma. Sid Gregory, who
led N.S.W., was disgusted to find that his men did
not imitate his conduct in the field, and were very
lax indeed. By judicious use of railway language, he,
however, got them tuned up, but not before Kort-
lang had got into double figures. Seitz, some time of
Oxford, was soon caught, by Mclvew, for nine, but
Kortlang bashed up 14 before Barbour caught him
off Cotter. The only Victorian to make a stand was
Armstrong, and he' was bowled by Kelleway when he
had made 51. The side vanished shortly after
lunch, leaving only a miserable 129 on the board.
'The only Ma State bowler to make any splash was
Kelleway, his three wickets having cost only 18 runs.
Cotter took two for 17, Hazlitt there for 50, and
Emery two for 42. Gregory and Bardsley opened for
N.S.W., and between them they rattled up 34, when
Bardsley was caught by Armstrong in the slips off
McDonald, for 23. Gregory went to 48, and then
was out l.b.w. But the two features of the day were
Hoy Minnett and Cotter, who, by the drawing of the
stumps, had slogged up 65 and 58 respectively, and
were going strong. At the end of the day, N.S.W.
had lost seven wickets for 240. On Saturday, Cotter
raised his little lot to 79, and Roy Minnett carried
his bat for 216 in a total score of 448. Armstrong
had proved himself the best bowler of the Vic-
torians, having taken five wickets for 104 runs. When
the Weary team went back to the wickets, it re-
quired no less than 319 to avert a one-innings’ defeat.
It was a hopeless-looking task. However, the bats-
men did their best, though by the close- of the day
they had accumulated only 176, and six wickets had
fallen. It looked more hopeless than ever. The
bowling honors of the day had fallen on Cotter, who
had taken three wickets for 40 runs. Play was re-
sumed on Monday under ideal conditions, and the
Victorians concentrated their efforts on avoiding that
one-innings’ defeat. It was a close thing, for, when
the last man went in, 38 runs were still required.
However, the last wicket cost 83 runs, and when the
Victorians left, they had the satisfaction of seeing
366 on the board. Waddy and Emery were sent
after the 48 runs that N.S.W. required to win, but
the former was bowled after scoring three.
Emery was bowled for 11, and Gregory again got
his leg before the wicket when he was 18. Then
Macartney and Bardsley knocked up 10 and eight
respectively, Sundries added two, and the match
was won by seven wickets. So the Ma State holds
the Sheffield Shield for another year.
* * * *
Nothing happened in connection with Mel-
bourne pennant cricket on Saturday that is likely to
cause a conflagration on the Yarra. Most of the
teams were short-handed in consequence of the inter-
state upheaval in Sydney and the colts’ debate with
the M.C.C. W. J. Scott, playing for Skinner’s Pets
against Carlton, accomplished a good in dogs, being
stumped after he had manufactured 118 Scott’s re-
cent good form will probably gain loi u another
trial in inter-State cricket, though, who previously
given a chance, he was miles away from being a con-
spicuous success, on account of his lamentable ner-
vousness. South’s score stood at six for 333 when
the stumps were extracted. Another good score was
that made by Park, a AVesley College boy, who hit
up 116 on behalf of Melbourne in the match against
Northcote, and ended his career by being run out.
Melbourne had made 286 for six wickets up to time
of adjournment of the debate. ’Varsity dismissed
Richmond for 241, and lost two of its own wickets
for 45. Essendon was sacked by East Melbourne
after it had collected a paltry 145. Before the close
of the day East had knocked up 116 without the loss
of a wicket. Press abuse has, apparently, not greatly
perturbed Peter McAlister, who contributed 56, not
out. Dunn made 45 and Sundries compiled a useful
15. There is something about the ’Don bowling that
howls for immediate correction. Fitzroy, playing
against North Melbourne, drove many temperate
spectators to the most adjacent drinkery, by making
213 for nine wickets, in a dreary manner, which had
a most debilitating effect upon the onlookers. In the St.
Kilda-Collingwood discussion ’Wood were sent back
to the pavilion after producing 293.
* * * *
The Insurgent Six are invited to consider
the doings of some of the colts before sending any
more “ultimatums” to the Board of Control. In
the N.S.W.-Vic. match Roy Minnett led the way
with 216 not out, and C. McKenzie, of Victoria,
achieved 121 at the expense of Cotter, Kelleway and
Co. At Melbourne, in the Colts’ match (under 25
years of age), Baring, of Victoria, piled up 130, and
Sandfo'rd biffed together 76, following a little lot of
124 in Vic. premiership matches a week previously.
W. Scott, of South Melbourne, also recently made an
impression in Victorian First Grade cricket, with 220
and 138 on successive Saturdays. Little things like
this, coupled with the quiet dignity of the assurance
of the Board of Control that it intends to carry out
its resolution, must make the Insurgent Six feel that
they are drawing near the end of their careers as
great cricketers. In fact, it is whispered that some
of “the Players” are wandering round complaining
that the letter has been misunderstood; and that it
did not mean what it appeared to say; and that a
certain amount of overplus was claimed in order to
give room for a generous application of give and
take. Anyhow, to-morrow (Friday) “the Players”
will have their fate decided for them, as the Board
will then officially consider their “ultimatum.”
• * * *
The way the last Australian XI slung
the money about is gradually becoming public know-
ledge, and the recent statement that “tips” swallowed
up £492 Bs. has caused a raising of eyebrows. The
balance-sheet of the 1896 team reveals that though'
England, America, Maoriland and Tasmania were all
visited, tips at grounds, hotels, railway stations and
on the s.s. Cuzco ate up merely £213 19s. 3d. The last
XI did things on a scale of grandeur which will make
the way of the next XI somewhat hard to travel.
The M.C.C. had a pleasant sort of a picnic
in Tasmania, where it overwhelmed the- Flyspeck XI
at Launceston, by eight wickets. The scores were:
M. 0.0., 332 and two wickets for 56, against Tassy’s
217 and 168. In the other match, at Hobart, the
English smote 574 for four wickets against Tassy’s
124 and 355, and thus won by an innings and 98
runs. The feature of the match was the fearsome
deed of Englishman Woolley, who threw up a solid
entrenchment of 305, and carried his bat at the end,
though eight bowlers were let loose against him.
Woolley’s score is the highest so far made«in English-
Austraiian cricket, and although it hardly seems fair
to count Tassy a first-class cricketing entity, the
figure goes into the book as a record.
* * * *
N.S.W. Cricket Association missed a
chance to do some good work last week. A special
meeting had been called to discuss the advisability of
recommending the Board of Control to abolish trial
balls at the change of bowlers in Test matches. This
practice irritates the public, which has already
shown its resentment, and it should be abolished. Un-
fortunately, the party who conceived the very sen-
sible idea was not present to propel his motion
through the special meeting, and it just fell down
dead.
* * * *
Brisbane cricket, on Saturday, saw the
resurrection of Roger Hartigan, when he compiled
135 out of a total score of 212. It also brought to
light one Jaggs, who walloped 121, not out. It was
a flash in the pan at a Test which secured Hartigan
a position in the last Australian XI which wandered
through Bull’s Land. Is he coming again?
- » * *
Saturday was a red-letter day in the boat-
ing world of Australia, inter-State struggles taking
place on Port Jackson (N.S.W.) and the Swan River
(Westralia). Port Jackson had no less than three,
and the Swan had the conflict for the 18ft. cham-
pionship of the continent. There was an 18ft. con-
test on Port Jackson, too, but it wasn’t a champion-
ship, only the races in the 10ft. ffnd 14ft. sections
carrying premier honors. On Port Jackson the Ma
State craft downed both Westralia and Queensland,
but on the Swan River the local boat, Westana, out-
pointed and outran the Sydney flier Nimrod (O.
Ilayes, captain) by ssee.
The Westralians took enormous interest in the
contest, and Perth emptied itself forth on to the
wooded heights of Mt. Eliza and the terraced ridges
of King’s Park, overlooking the Narrows, in which
the race ended. Five started, all but Nimrod being
local representatives. It was 4 p.m. when the flag
fell, and Nimrod glided first over the line, followed
by Westana, Robin, Eurus and Aldus, in that order.
Westana hung closely to the Cornstalk boat, and
behind it Eurus labored heavily with a superfluity of
canvas. Alolus carried away the throat halliards,
and was outed, and then Eurus began to make up
leeway, gaining steadily till the canvas split in a
nasty squall,' and fell on the crew. So far, Nimrod
had led the whole way, and at half-way through the
journey was 67sec. ahead of the Westana. On the
run home both Nimrod and Westana let fly every
extra that could be crowded on, and Westana began
to move up under spinnaker, ringtail and topsail.
Nimrod’s spinnaker skied several times, and then the
mast cracked dangerously. But the N.S.W. boat
rushed on, for it was neck or nothing, owing to the
way the Westana was coming up, having reduced the
lead to 39see. Nimrod’s captain, however, did not
dare to use the spinnaker with his damaged mast,
while Westana crowded on every inch, and bounded
to the front. Nimrod let fly a ringtail, and came
alongside and regained the lead. Westana then sent
up a ringtail, and recovered the position, and Nimrod
crossed the Westralian’s stern in an endeavor to
blanket it. The manoeuvre failed, and AVestana
sailed in with a margin of ssec. Robin was third.
In the 10ft. championship on Port Jackson, the
Britannia, from Westralia, and the Commonwealth,
from Queensland, failed utterly, the positions all
being filled by local boats, led by AVargtah, with W.
Keddie in command. In the 14ft. event it was just
the same. The battle for positions was fought out
among the local boats, and the Queensland represen-
tative, also called Waratah, failed to gain a place.
The Prince Alfred Yacht Club’s race for the
Rawhiti Cup, on Port Jackson, was somewhat excit-
ing. Eight started in a strong north-easter, which
damaged gear and capsized smaller boats all over the
ceiling of the harbor. Petrel would undoubtedly
have won the Rawhiti Cup, but for the throat giving

to say also, but that the boom sprung and the yacht

with Yeulba second, only 25sec. away. The huge
Thelma was third, 54sec. behind Yeulba.

A pleasant announcement last week was
that Sydney swimmer W. Longworth, who has been
sweeping everything before him of late, is a certainty #
for the Olympic games, to be held at Stockholm, *
Sweden, this year. He is certainly the most repre-
sentative swimmer Australia has on deck just now.
Speaking of his intended trip, he said that if the
Swimming Association could not raise the money to
send him, he had traces of a copper or two of his
own, and was going, anyhow.
* * * *
Longworth and Hardwick both visited
Adelaide on the first occasion of its holding the ama-
teur swimming championships. The local authorities
resolved to cut out salt water altogether, and had
two evenings in the City Baths and one afternoon
in a deep 110yds. pool, rather surprisingly contrived
among the quiet shallows of the Torrens, away up at
Walkerville. The local opposition was plucky, but
not very effective, and Longworth showed himself
consistently a bit faster than his colleague from
Sydney. The mile, the half, and the 220yds. were
the three champion events allotted to Adelaide, and
he won them all, in good, though not startling,
times. Then all parties moved on to Westralia to
renew the contests.
Apparently something in the shape of a
tragedy has happened the 36ft. yawl Pandora, which
left Sydney in August, 1910. The crew consisted of
Captains Blythe and Arapakis, and they had pro-
mised themselves a cruise right round the world in
the crazy craft, which was nothing more nor less
than a flagrant defiance of Providence. And Provi-
dence is a strange Being to play tricks with. The
yawl reached New York in safety, after rounding
Cape Horn in the father of a gale. An old grey
wave the size of some elephants gripped the little
ship, and turned it right over, but before the crew
could fall out of it, a nice, friendly young wave
gripped it and set it on its keel again, leaving the
mast afloat in the vasty deep. As the yawl was
fitted with an auxiliary engine, the loSs bf the iiiast
was not a hopeless disaster, and the adventurous
company of two proceeded on its way, marvelling at
its luck. New York was reached in safety, and then
the yawl headed for England along the northern
track, which at that time of the year iS abandoned
to icebergs. And from the day the little craft left
New York, there has been ho word Or trace Of it. At
time of writing, Captains Blythe and Arapakis are
four months overdue, So there is but little doubt
that the North Atlantic has swallowed the little
Pandora, which the Pacific found such ah indigestible
morsel.

Australia is hot the only place that is
suffering from Wowseritis at the present time. In
England public biff has been practically killed by
legislation which makes it unsafe for anybody to be
present at a scrap, just in case anything unpleasant
should happen. And the humor of it is that biff
is not in any way suppressed—only public biff.
The clerical humbug who lately howled, “What is
not good enough for England is not good enough for
Australia,” was braying up the wrong tret. All that
has happened in England is the practical suppression
of public boxing—exhibitions at which the police
were present to prevent brutality and to which any-
one might go, and where the boxers received decent
money. The private proprietary boxing saloons,
patronised by the old nobility and wealthy middle
classes, like the National Sporting Club, are as
immune as ever. They have their weekly encounters
for the edification of the very best people, who, of
course, are members of the club. Thereare no
police present to prevent cruelty, as the "premises
are private, and any sort of horror can be carried
on, so long as neither combatant squeaks. For ex-
ample, it was at the National Sporting Club that
kindly old Peter Jackson had Slavin in such a bad
way once, that he stalled the tottering ruin off with
one hand, and, turning to the referee, besought him,
in the name of humanity, to stop the fight. Lord
Lonsdale, however, explained to Jackson that, by the
rules of the club, there must be a knockout, and so a
knockout there was. In the United States, the roar
of the Wowser is also sky-high in the land. The
Governor of New York State is a Wowser of the
deepest dye. As he is unable to prevent boxing
right out, he has ulcased that matches shall not
exceed 10 rounds, that the referee shall give no de-
cision, and that the. public must decide for- itself
which fighter has scored the most points. The result
is that all the men at the top of the stoush ladder
have crowded to N’York, where, as long as they can
avoid a knock-out, their championships are per-
fectly safe. In New York, prize fights are more
numerous than in ’Frisco, where decisions are given
by a qualified referee. In fact, N’Yark has more
scraps in a week than ’Frisco has in a month.

When Carl Morris fought Jim Flynn, the
latter made a chopping-block of the former, and the
papers howled at the former for having gone into the
ring totally unprepared. Morris had been the White
Hope and the press hurled him down from his proud
position and bestowed upon him “rats.” Now the
press is clearing its, eye, and remarking .that, per-
haps, it spoke in a hurry; and that it is more than
possible that Morris is a genuine White Hope after
all. He went up against one “Denver” Jack Geyer
recently, and, as the public had watched his training,
it was known that he had done all that a man may
do to get into condition. But when he entered the
ring the audience was horrified to note that rolls of
fat hung out over his belt, and he looked about as
hard as a melon grown in swampy ground. Yet
when he got to work it was found that he was all
there, and he put it all over the gentleman known
as the “Denver Cyclone.” The latter couldn’t ’clone
worth a cent, but the failure was due only to the
fact that Morris had improved out of sight. His
whole scheme of fighting had changed, and he who
had been a borer and a slogger had suddenly become
a boxer who side-stepped, ducked, used his head, and
showed wonderful improvement in the way he threw
his hands about. Of course, it is one thing to treat
a man like Geyer in this fashion, and quite another
to serve it out to a master of the Johnson type.
But the point is that Morris has the vast strength,
the depth of lung space, and the ability to take pun-
ishment that are necessary to a real champion. The
only question is: Can he be taught the art of the
game? In other words, has he the brains to take
advantage of his splendid physical endowment ?
Opinions are divided, but Time will no doubt throw
light on the dark subject.
* * ♦ *
Last week’s scrap between the newly-
arrived Yankee heavyweight (Barry) and Bill Lang,
at the Mclnstoush (Sydney) Stadium, held something
extra in the way of interest. It was Barry’s first ap-
pearance, and people were anxious to see what he is
like. Also, it was Bill Lang’s last chance—his final
appeal to Fortune. To be defeated meant stepping
into the ranks of the Has Beens, and to linger a
little while superfluous on the stage as a chopping-
block, on which new and rising men would try their
mettle. William was anxious to keep away from the
crowd of the Men Who Have Gone Before as long as
possible, and had trained with a care and energy he
had never previously shown. Also, he had, ap-
parently, been thinking hard, and set himself to as-
similate some of the science of fisticraft. His work
showed much improvement, but the vim that makes
for victory was not there, and though he boxed ex-
cellently and scored many points, triumphant youth
and greater strength conquered him. He had a num-
ber of narrow escapes, was dropped in the third
round, and sent reeling in the 13th, when he would
have certainly been knocked out but for the bell.
However, he managed to last till the end. Then the
foregone verdict was duly delivered, and Billiam
found himself an outed man on almost the same spot
where he had ended Bob Fitzsimmons’s fighting
career on Boxing Day, 1909 .
As for Barry, this paper has no compliments to
waste over that young man. Like most of the modern
school of Yankee fighters, he knows very little more
about the science of boxing than he does of the 39
Articles, or the fourth dimension. He is a borer and
a slogger, a crude individual who is willing to take
a heavy bash in order to get home a knock-out wal-
lop. For that reason he will be popular with the
public, the mass of which wouldn’t know good fight-
ing if it was shown, and prefer an exhibition of
general ruin to a display of fistic science. Boxing
appears to be almost a lost art. It has given place
to a cruder thing—glove-fighting ; and the change is
regrettable. It was Jim Jeffries who started the de-
cadence with his method of rushing in, despite all
punishment, to get his rib-smashing blow home. Be-
cause it was effective with him, the risjng generation
of fighters began to adopt the method, and before
anyone realised it, the game had gone to the dogs.
That referee, who in England recently stopped a fight,
and gave one man the decision because the other fel-
low wasn’t boxing, but waiting for a knock-out, was
quite right from a boxing standpoint; but he would
have to be escorted home by the police if he gave
such a decision in Australia or Y'ankeeland. One of
the reasons Jack Johnson is so obviously ahead of all
present competitors is because he is a boxer, and not
a mere stousher like the crowd that looks hungrily
for his place. They will have to learn a lot more
about the science of the game than they know at pre-
sent before they knock that haughty black off his
pedestal.
On Anniversary night the Stadium saw a
more pleasant sight, when that sprightly Australian
thoroughbred, Dave Smith, galloped all round and
over the plodding, heavy-draught Yankee, Johnny
Thompson. Smith must have landed somewhere about
100 knock-out blows on the sturdy Yank, but they did
not seem to trouble that mass of hardened meat and
bone overmuch. On the other hand, on the rare
occasions in which Thompson did manage to make
contact with Smith —Well, Smith had no doubts
whatever as to whether he had been hit or not. But
it was a one-man scrap, and Smith’s skill over-
whelmed Thompson with a deluge of points. Thomp-
son wore wide, white knickers, or rather they were
white when he entered the ring, but the water that
trickled down during the refreshment stages gradu-
ally brought the dye' out of the trunks he wore be-
neath them, and Joseph’s coat or a prize rainbow
was simply not in it with those wonderful knickers.
* * * *
Barry has got the talking habit badly.
All through the tight he chatters pleasantly (never
offensively) to his opponent, makes remarks to his
seconds, and during intervals converses with the
people in the front seats. In fact, he mags altogether
too much. Another curious mannerism is his habit
of trumpeting loudly through his nose, like a minia-
ture elephant, when the other fellow lands one; and
emitting a fearsome snort when he lands one himself.
He is built on exceptionally powerful lines, and is a
wrestler as well as a boxe?, having stood up to Frank
Gotch himself for 18min. He would have stayed
longer, only Gotch’s knee slipped and broke his nose.
Then Barry “chucked it.’’
# * * *
The why and wherefore of the postpone-
ment of the tight between Langford and McVea
burst out suddenly last week, when McVea’s manager,
Billy McLain, made an impassioned statement to the
press. Boiled down, McVea, on the strength of his
recent victory, wants the lion’s share of the purse,
and his idea of the lion’s share does not coincide
with that of Mr. Mclntosh. So there’s nothing doing ;
and the public disappointment will be soothed by a
scrap between Langford and Barry, on February 10.
These two have fought frequently, and, although
Langford has invariably won, he has found it a harder
and longer job on each occasion. Last time it took
him 16 rounds to do it, so this time it is possible he
may not be able to accomplish it in 20 rounds
* • * * *
Much bray has been let loose over the
idea of substituting a committee of three or more
“experts” at the ringside for the referee in the ring
as at present. It is hard to see what would be gained
by such a change, and it might lead to a free tight
among the experts, who, after all, would be only
human. The nearest approach to an infallible de-
cision could be got in this way. Let all tights take
place in daylight, and have pictures taken of them
from both sides of the ring. Then the pictures could
. be run through before the committee several times,
and where there were divergencies of opinion the films
could be run through again, more and more slowly,
to show full details. They could, if necessary, be run
through so slowly that a solitary biff would look as
gradual as the Boer campaign. This would at least
prevent hasty legislation. Under existing arrange-
ments it only requires one man’s sudden blunder to
rob the rightful winner of victory. Under the pro-
posed committee method there would be the sudden
blunders of three men to contend with. Every fol-
lower of boxing has his own method of awarding
points, and, of course, they are all wrong according
to the other fellow; and who is to judge, anyhow?
The cinematograph method would have this saving
grace: it would record every blow struck. The
human eye doesn’t see more than half at the inost..
When Battling Nelson fouled Joe Gans, nobody could
be found to swear he had seen the foul blow struck,
and it was not till the pictures Were run through
slowly that it was discovered. It turned out to be
a right short-arm jolt, in which Nelson suddenly
raised the shoulder and dropped the fist, giving it a
downward drive, which the picture showed landing
on the forbidden area. But it would take a lot of
the public interest out of the tight if the mob had to
wait 21 hours for the decision.
* * * *
It was a bright and breezy battle that re-
sulted in the Commonwealth “bant” championship
passing from Teddy Green, of Woolloomooloo, or
thereabout, to Charlie Simpson, of Collingwood, or its
vicinity. The scrap raged at Melbourne Athletic
Pavilion, and 17 clever and engaging rounds were
fought before Green admitted the folly of submitting
himself to further battering. The Victorian was 3lb.
bigger, and 18 years younger, than little Teddy
Green, and for several rounds Edward gave Charles
the impression that he was trying to hit a flea with
an anvil. But Simpson is no slouch; he is quick,
aggressive and shifty, has a clipper left, and as nice
a right for an unlooked-for uppercut as any in the
business. He was a winner from pretty early in the
game, and, after the 17th, Green admitted he could
go no further without converting the fight into a
one-sided case of common assault.

Morse’s Indian Root Pills who speak in
accord with my views. You may use these
lines for publication.”

lic has been more successful than Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills in relieving this
complaint. Thousands of people can testify

arising from imperfect digestion, which,
after all, is the cause of constipation.

The Board of Trade is said to be consid-
ering a proposition that all steamers should
install a “sick bay” for the use of the crew.
At present there is no place where an un-
well man can be tucked away to receive at-
tention. He just has to “lay in his bunk and
hope,” and a fo’c’s’l bunk doesn’t reek with
fresh air, comfort, quiet and the other things
that are liable to make hope hatch any-
thing worth having. The Board might
crowd on canvas and go a bit further by
logging an order that, on the larger steamers,
where there is a good-sized crew of deck
hands and stokers, some person with a real
smattering of medical science should be car-
ried. The skipper, or one of the mates, is
supposed to know something of doctoring,
but usually there is more supposition than
knowledge about it. When anybody is re-
ported sick the old man examines him, and
catches hold of any symptoms that are
sticking out prominently. Then he goes to
the medicine chest, where the bottles are
numbered, looks up the index, and finds the
one that seems to suit the most conspicuous
symptom. The medicine chest is always
stocked up with quinine, and the sick man
usually gets a dose of that for luck, and
just in case the sickness is something quinine
is good for. If a man is even vaguely sus-
pected of malingering, he is treated to the
beastliest-tasting drug available; and if that
and the lamp-room and the stoppage of his
tobacco don’t jerk him back to duty, he is
probably really sick, and the genuine search
for symptoms begins. In plenty of cases the
man dies before it has been decided he Is not
a malingerer, which is unfortunate for him
and annoying for the skipper—especially if
be is shorthanded.

THE NEW FEATURES OF THIS REGISTER.
Nine separate totals in pounds, shillings and pence o&
different kinds of transactions and of the sales of different assist-
ants. in addition to grand total of all cash sales.
Amount of each cash sale made by each assistant is auto-
matically added into a separate total. Every time a sale is made
the amount is added to the total previously shown for that assistant.
Every penny received for cash sales is recorded twice by
this register—on the adding wheels of the assistant making the
sale and on the “secret” or grand total adder. A printed record
giving full particulars is made at the same time.
Amount in pounds, shillings and pence received in payment of
accounts is shown on another set of adding wheels. This obviates
the necessity of going through dockets or cash book to find how much
money has been received on account—the total is ready at all times.
Total value of all goods sold on credit is recorded separately.
A glance will show the amount of credit business for the day or to
date from any stated time. This record enables the shopkeeper
to see at once what his total turnover has been.
Every penny paid out is added to previous total amount of
disbursements.
Think of the advantages of having all these separate totals and
of being able to obtain such valuable information by merely turn-
ing a key and glancing at the records.
These are Seme of the Improvements.

SPEED is not desired by everyone who rides a
Motor Cycle. To set out on a journey, and feel
assured that you will reach your destination,
travelling at a moderate rate of speed—having
no fear for the steep hills with bad corners, or
the bad stretches of road you may encounter,
and enjoying the entire absence of belt troubles.
These are ideal conditions, and will appeal
strongly to a large number of people, who put
COMFORT and RELIABILITY before mere
speed. All are features of
The Speedwell F.N. Lightweight
which combines a free engine, controlled from the handle bars, and a 2-speed gear that cannot get out
of order, and which is thoroughly encased from the weather. . .
We have a sectional Model of this machine in our Showrooms that will explain the functions oi
the various parts of the engine and gears, etc. An object lesson of the greatest possible value to
those who want to master their subject, and have the ambition to become expert motorists.
Call and let us explain it to you.

Don’t get the idea into your head that because you have got just
a few shy hairs on your upper lip that you cannot grow a mous-
tache. You can grow a moustache—abundance of hair, if you use
CAPILLARINE. The hair cells are there, but need nourishing.
Just a little CAPILLARINE rubbed, in each night before retiring will
sink right to those hair roots; feed them, nourish them, bring hair-
growing life to them. No one can tell you use it, because it leaves no
trace of its having been applied.

the noise made by a peck of beer. It is only by an
evasion of this sort that we can avoid falling into
actionable language.... Hee Kee: Glad to hear from

A GRIM CONFESSION.
I was hunted resumed the criminal
By the wolves of the law
And one even tracked Me
To a distant shore
He came upon me and exclaimed
You are my prisoner Jim
He recognised me
And I recognised him
But I had pledged an oath
He’d never take me again
And I lodged a bullet
In his Artful Brain
Upon his lifeless mass
The morning sun did shine
I armed myself with his papers
And his secret was mine
He was buried as an unknown
In a land o’er the sea
And I toured in style
As Detective George Lee.
E. Temple: Bill’s barmaid discharged. She
doesn’t hang together, is too snappy, and doesn’t look
probable.. . .1.L.: Poem to hand. We note with plea-
sure that it is your intention to return to the old
home where the lilac bush has withered. We also
note that the report circulated by certain parties that
you were old is utterly unfounded, the real fact of
the matter being that you are young again. Wish
you every success, and trust that you will be able to
revive the lilac bush. . . .Edward M.C.: The first line
of the poem—“ The sun went down at half-past six”
—is simple and effective, even if a little too exact.
The rest of it, from “Oh! my God how stalk the
ghosts” to “Alas! Alas! the years go by,” does not
appeal to u5....P.H.: Herewith part of your wail
for the old days, and songs, and the station whereof
the boundary-fence went three laps to the mile:—
THE OLD, OLD DAYS.
Oh! give me back the old old days
The days when my heart was young
Oh! give me back the old old days
And give me the songs that I sung.
I’m buried here in the city
With never a minute to spare
And I know my heart’s just longing
For the days of devil-may-care.
The days when I’d rise in the morning
And feel myself king over all
To gallop at will round the station
With never a thought of a fall.
The gallops we had on the soft, brown turf
The reckless jumps at the gates
Never a fence but what we’d clear
When you and I were mates.
And I’m going back to the old home
To live the life that I led
To sing the songs that I used to sing
In the days ere my soul was dead.

W. Dowman: There is a scratchy haze about your
pictures, and they don’t seem to represent anything
special. Why, for instance, should a nigger in a
plug-hat be looking through the window of a fowl-
house, while a white man faints inside, and three
others watch him? And you call it “The All-con-
quering 81ack.”... .E.M.S.: No life or action in pic-
ture, and the hero seems .to have three legs, including
the wooden 0ne.... Lartce M.: Give it up. We are
weary of trying to devise new ways of telling you
that your pictures could hardly be worse. Abandon
the struggle, and draw the game, and bank the fires.
Knock off work and call it a day. In short, chuck
it!....Effie F.: Hardly good enough, yet we have
seen worse... .Schneider: Wouldn’t like to say it is
beneath contempt, but it is beneath almost everything
else... .Cliff K.: Our respect for the cloth forbids us
to accept a gag in which a parson is described as
“old cock.” .E.M.8.: Three of the oldest possible
steals vilely illustrated. .. .T.E.G.: The sketch might
just pull through, but that absent-minded curate who
said: “Here endeth the first innings,” dates back a
long way....J.M.: Workmanship good, but subject
not cheerful. .. .A.W.C.: Nobody laughed at it
T.E.K.: The jokes are not new; but the drawings are
original, we’il swear... .W.S.R., H.O’C., Laracomb,
F. McC., Billabong Bill, A.V.8.: Unsuitable....
M. J.D.: We’ve already thrown those bricks....
F.R.K.: Won’t do. This paper isn’t digging its pen
into the cadet. It wants him trained : —-but it wants
his big brother trained t 00... .P.J.M.: “Seat of
Learning” is a frayed old gag. ... J. 8.: Too micros-
copic .... Agnes R.: They’ve all been drawing their
old age pensions for years.... H.J.E.: It has been
pictured that way too often; but you could have
made a good par of it. . . .Egg: Not even good in
places now, though “The Same Thing” was very fair
fruit when it was first laid.... A.L.: Faint pencil
sketch of well-developed girls rejected.
Before Henniker Heaton goes out of Aus-
tralia he ought to arrange to bring his Aus-
tralian “Dictionary of Dates” up to the
moment. Apparently the last edition of the
interesting bundle of out-of-the-way Aus-
tralian facts occurred in 1879; and several
things have happened since then. Other
books have taken the place of the “Men of
the Times” section of Heaton’s volume; but
there isn’t another to which one can turn
with confidence when one wants to know,
for instance, when some bushranger was
hanged; and a volume that leaves Ned
Kelly’s little party half-way between Glen-
rowan and the gallows isn’t as up-to-date
as it might be. For years Henniker Heaton
went on gathering data, and probably never
left off doing it; but the information that
bulges out of his own private lumber-room
isn’t doing much good to any harassed Aus-
tralian..

A Remarkable and Convincing State-
ment of the Success of Cuticura
Soap and Ointment in theTreat-
mentofthe Pain, Itching and
Burning of Eczema
“I, the undersigned, cannot give enough
praise to the Cuticura Remedies. I had been
doctoring for at least a year for eczema on
my foot. I had tried doctor after doctor all
to no avail. When a young girl I sprained
my ankle three different times, paying little
or no attention to it, when five years ago
a small spot showed upon my left ankle.
I was worried and sent for a doctor. He
said it was eczema. He drew a small bone
from the ankle about the size of a match
and about an inch long. The small hole
grew to about the size of an apple, and
the eczema spread to the knee. The doctors
never could heal the hole in the ankle.
The whole foot ran water all the time.
“My husband and my sons were up night
and day wheeling me from one room to an-
other in the hope of giving me some relief.
I would sit for hours at a time in front of
the fireplace hoping for daybreak. The
pain was so intense I was almost crazy,
in fact, I would lose my reason for hours
at a time. One day a friend of mine dropped
in to see me. No more had she glanced at
my foot than she exclaimed, ‘Mrs. Finnegan,
why in the world don’t you try the Cuti-
cura Remedies!’ Being disgusted with the
doctors and their medicines, and not being
able to sleep at all, 1 decided to give the
Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment a
trial. After using them three days that
night I slept as sound as a silver dollar
for eight long hours. I awoke in the morning
with but very little pain, in fact, I thought
I was in heaven. After using the Cuticura
Remedies for three months I was perfectly
restored to health, thanks to the Cuticura
Soap and Ointment. I will be sixty-four
years of age my next birthday, hale and
hearty at present.” (Signed) Mrs. Julia Finne-
fan, 2234 Hebert St., St. Louis, Mo., U. S. A.,
larch 7,1911.
Sold everywhere. Send to R. Towns & Co.,

WHAT FAMOUS DOCTORS SAY OF
antineurasthin
THE NEW NERVE AND BRAIN FOOD.
Dr. GUISEPPE LAPONNI (Physician-in-Ordinary
to His Holiness Pope Pius X.) wrote: —
“‘Antineurasthin’... is an admirable agent for
toning and strengthening the Nervous System. I
shall not fail to recommend it to my colleagues.”
Dr. ZAMARA (Physician to the Bad Hofgastein
Health Resort) wrote, after making' a careful analy-
sis and subjecting “Antineurasthin” to exhaustive
personal tests: “In proportion as mankind is weaned
from the use of Nerve-destroying drugs, and devote
their attention to your healthy Nerve Food, they will
be cured of Nervousness.”
Dr. LION, the Director of the Russian State Hos-
pital for Epileptics at St. Petersburg, reports magi-
cal results obtained from trials made exclusively
with “Antineurasthin” on Nerve Sufferers. An im-
mediate and marked increase in mental vigor and
bodily strength; increased appetite and sleep—-re-
moval of constipation and tendency to tire rapidly of
work; calmness and marked increase in self-confi-
dence, etc.

If the digestive functions, however weak, can do
any at all they should be given work to do to the
extent of their powers. In the easy process of its prepara-
tion the digestibility of Benger’s can be regulated to give
this work with extreme nicety.

“10-2-4” •. Surely the cricketer is the pawnbroker,
not to say the usurer, of sport. Is there any other
athlete in the British Empire who broods so cease-
lessly on the question of cash, or kicks up a more
deafening row when he considers that a few shillings
less have been offered for his wares than the same are
worth? For me, I do not know one. The pug.—he
whose profession ranked but yesterday with cricket as
one of Britain’s glories-—may argue a trifle about the
financial question at the beginning of things, but
afterwards you do not hear a word from him. The
sable outrage, Johnson, was the only fighter that' I
ever remember who nauseated the public with in-
cessant harpings on the subject of lucre. And, of
course, Tommy Burns, in his prime, had a powerful
leaven of the same offensive quality. But neither cf
them came anywhere near, in this respect, a dozen
or more cricketers one could name. Footballers,
swimmers, wrestlers, runners, jockeys, bicyclists and
hordes of others who sell their peculiar talents for
the delectation of the multitude, are rarely to be
seen wrangling in public concerning the remuneration
that is coming to them. On the other hand, one
hardly ever opens a daily paper without reading that
Snifter, the gifted trundler, absolutely declines to
make the English tour for the £4OO, plus “ex-
penses,” which had be.en decided on. Elsewhere o.ie
observes that Blankey will not bat—thus causing thr
loss to cricket of hundreds of sovereigns’ worth of
gate-money—nor will Blastte, the peerless young
stumper, perform, unless the fees of each are sub-
stantially hoisted. And the day after the Board of
Control, which manages the finances of this grand
old sporting pastime, i,as placard Blankey anu
Blastte, the entire team to which they belong pro-
bably threatens to strike because of some fore-
shadowed arrangement, calculated to take a trifle off
the players’ earnings. For shameless, sordid avari-
ciousness, the cricketer seems to me to occupy a niche
of his own.
“Mayhe Stay”: “Brass Button” (B. 28/12/’ll) is
very right in protesting against the infallibility
required of a shipmaster, and the way the horsehair-
trimmed executioners rip away his livelihood if he
makes an error, even under circumstances of the
utmost stress. But he left out an even greater hard-
ship—the underwriters’ black list. “Lloyd’s Confi-
dential Report” contains the name of every man who
has, or recently had, charge of a ship; and every
mishap that causes expense to the insurance cos.
means a black mark against somebody in that list.
At any time that black mark may mean an increased
premium on the ship the officer commands, and, con-
sequently, his obliteration. This is a secret thing
against which there is no appeal. We want the right
of appeal against Marine Court findings. It should
have been in the Navigation Bill, yet I couldn’t find it
there. But at least a Marine Court of Inquiry is public,
however excessively unjust some of its findings may be,
especially in Sydney; and there is some slight pro-
tection in the publicity. Against the underwriters,
on the other hand, we are helpless. The money
interest has us absolutely in the hollow of its hand,
and it has -no bowels of compassion.
* * * *
“Side-lights”: It looks as if Australian shipping
is going to shake out a reef in 1912. Already
rumors are washing around of new lines launching
or old ones extending. It is almost certain that one
will be run from Fiume, and the tales of the Cunard
co. poking its bows into Indian and Australian waters
have gone a few knots further. The Spreckels liners
are said to be fitting for sea service to commence
about March, and signals have been hoisted of a new
service to be opened between Australian ports.
Naturally, the promoters are not blowing steam
sirens arid hooters till they are ready to swim in, but
it is extremely probable that the new inter-Staters
will open with a couple of steamers on an early date.
The boats will be primarily cargo-wallahs, but will
have a limited passenger accommodation. Another
threatened bombshell is the opening of a new cargo
service between Australian ports and the United
Kingdom by a well-known co., which already runs a
fine fleet of passenger liners with limited cargo
space. These people will cart the cold-stored rabbit
and jumbuek as well as general cargo, and until they
have' their own boats built, will carry on with char-
tered high-speed steamers. No definite date is posted
for the start yet, but it will probably be within the
next two or three months.
* * * *
From “The Lookout”: The Ounard Co. will prob-
ably be running a line to this Labor-blasted country
in a short time. The vast concern is earnestly en-
gaged, at present, swallowing the Anchor Line, which
trades across the Western Ocean, and when that meal
is accomplished, it will have a bigger fleet than it
will need for its old routes. As an additional factor
in favor of the Australian proposition, the Cunard
people have a line running from Italian ports to
America under an Austrian Government contract, and
this expires soon. The Cunard is not likely to get
a renewal, as there are half a dozen fine Austrian
lines which are going out to capture the contract,
and one of them is likely to get it. So the Cunard
will lose its present subsidy, and this will probably
mean running the line at a loss, or having many good
ships eating their fo’c’s’l’ heads off in idleness, or
finding another trade and country to push into.
The vessels now on the Austrian job are in every way
suitable for the Australian run, especially if it is the
passenger traffic that is being aimed at. They are
the Carpathia, Saxonia, Pannonia and Ultonia.
Although they are not in the front rank amongst
Atlantic liners for age, speed, size and luxury, they
are still all fast and comparatively new.
“Bank Clerk”: I used to wonder where
these petitions against the registration of
unions or formations of wages boards, in re-
gard to sweated workers, came from. I won-
der no longer, having met one in full career
the other day. It was sent round our bank,
accompanied by the following remark : “Oh,
Mr. Thirty Bob, sign this paper, will you?
It’s a petition to the Industrial Court
against this whatsitsname for clerks —wages
board, you know.” Of course, all the fel-
lows signed it. You bet. Some of them
didn’t know what it was, but those who did
couldn’t make any kick unless they were
prepared for trouble. And it is wonderful
what a lot of trouble you can find in a bank
if you’re hankering after it. I don’t know
what value those petitions will have in the
mind of the Court, but, as one of the men
who signed, in accordance with the desires
of the heads, I hope they are taken for what
they are worth. And, after careful calcu-
lation, I reckon they are worth •01. You
can take it from a man inside the wheel
that the bank-clerks of Australia not only
want a wages board to inquire into their
conditions, but they need one; and if the
inquiry is held, and it is a full and fair
inquiry, the public will get some reading
which will make the cabled news dry hash
by comparison.
THE PROTESTANTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TuiißAitu.MßA, Saturday.
The shire council yesterday struck a new rate of
14d. in the £, being a farthing higher than last
year. Land-owners are loudly protesting — News item.
Wails, cries, lamentations, ululations ascending!
Moans from afar, continuing, unsubduable!
Mournful cacklings and loud crepitations!
Bellows and reverberations, camerados!
Thunder and squeals from Tumbarumba, Land of
Weird Noises and Uncanny Echoes —
Land avoided by Binghi, and tabu to Combo, by
reason of excessive and inexplicable reper-
cussivity—
From Tumbarumba, grumblings and rumblings, mes
enfants !
What sounds of woe and horror !
Crescendoes of agony—climaces of shuddering sound
Outswelling the roar of Apollyon stricken by Chris-
tian, or the cries of Hercules, wrapped in the
torturing shirt of the Centaur!
Outsquealing the excited remarks of the Gadarene
swine as they' headed for the Mediterranean !
Whence this hideous up-down- and all-round roar ?
Is Hell broke loose, or are the gates of Tartarus ajar?
Nay, camerados; ’tis but the anguished howl of the
strong landowner in his agony !
He is bewailing the New Year, camerados.
“Farewell 1911! Farewell Prosperity! Farewell

IT’S very difficult —in fact, too risky—to attempt to lay out a drain, plan
a channel, or find the height of a spring with the eye only.
Levelling Instrument
and Transit No. 998,
as illustrated, has been specially designed to meet the requirements for all
kinds of draining, irrigating, road building, house foundation, grading, setting
out orchards, fences, getting angles, and every kind of farm work, requiring
such an instrument. The price, 80/-, complete with extension legs, is but a
fraction of that usually charged for a surveyor’s instrument. It will prove
most helpful in performing many tasks that have hitherto been done by
guess, and therefore unsatisfactory.
.“Get Guaranteed Accuracy!”
We also have No. 99F, with telescope, extension legs and ground and
graduated level glass, at £7/10/-. Levelling instrument only, at 46/-.
If you use Tools —“on the Land ” or in the Workshop—it will pay you
to get acquainted with our stock and prices. Our 256 page Catalogue, with
over 2000 illustrations is the medium. Ask us to send it Post Free now.

They are admittedly the best of all Motor

WHY ?
They use only the yellow or more penetra-

dazzling violet rays. In other words, they
give a longer and better light than other
lamps. They do away with dfiep shadows, and
enable a clearer discernment of distant ob-
jects. Their brass work is that solid type of
work and material that one associates with
first-class British goods. The lamps are made
in various sizes and designs. Insist on your
cars being fitted with “Goldenlyte” Lamps.
They are the best, yet cost no more than
others. They will last and-please for a life-
time.

Mr. Badger’s Tramways.
The joy of having a great public utility like
the trams in the hands of Private Enter-
prise has become so apparent of late, that
the people of Brisbane are almost liable to
burst with happiness. In fact, they may
burst unless hooped up. The row between
Manager Badger and his employees was not,
to begin with, a matter of wide public con-
cern, but it spread till it became
about as public as anything could be.
If the community cordially approves of
Badger and his doings, then it t is, of
course, fully entitled to have a general
strike, or any other commotion and incon-
venience that may be available. Every
community has a right to wliatever incon-
venience it really wants. Unfortunately,
when railways or tramways or water-works
or coal supply or lighting arrangements are
in the hands of Private Enterprise, one arro-
gant or tactless person in charge—a person
who isn’t in any way responsible to the
people—may bring about a fuss on some
matter that the people take no interest in,
and about which they have been in no way
consulted, and, in the course of his private
row, cooking and washing and locomotion may
be suspended and civilisation hung up. Now
the ' kramways may belong to Badger’s
company, but the civilisation belongs to the
community, and if any mismanagement on
the part of Badger damages that great
public property, the community has a right
to complain. It has even a right to demand
that the trams shall pass to the control of
some authority that can run tnem Without
making a hash of the framework of society.
When public utilities are owned by the
State, the people can at least do something
to prevent or to end disturbances. They
have some voice in deciding whether they
will have a great industrial scrimmage ; or
noi;. They are, in a rneasqre, voluntary
parties to the fight—not mere onlookers
being trodden underfoot by both combat-
ants, without any say in the matter. Just
now they are in a fair way to stand about
99 per cent, of the loss and
yet, because of the blessings of Private
Enterprise, they can’t prevent the shindy;
they can’t stop it; their opinion about it
cpunts for nothing; and they won’t even
have the retrospective joy of throwing out
Badger at next, general election, for Badger
isn’t elected. Badger, in fact, has the right
to fight out his personal quarrel in the
State’s china shop, amid the crash of the
State’s falling crockery, and so has every
other man in a similar position. It is quite
possible for the boss of a Private Enterprise
tramway or gas concern to start, off his own
bat, a row of, such size and expense that it
would have paid the city better to stick to
the old bullock dray and the ancient kero
sene lamp. And it is a great deal too much
power for any one individual to have. He
is much in the position of a monarch, with
the right to declare war between two ad-
jacent States, and then leave them to fight
it out.
L2«. ■
This little statement of the Brisbane
Tramway Co.’s profits probably explains the
Badger’s swollen head: —
1906 .. . . £24,961 11909 .. ..£47,977
1907 . . . . 32,669 1910 . . . . 77,014
1908 . . . . 39,858 |
Of course it wasn’t Badger who bounced
the profit up from £24,961 to £77,014 in
five years; it was the growth of Brisbane
that did it —that and the fact that Bris-
bane has enough cash in its pocket nowa-
days to hang the expense of a tram-ride.
Also, Badger and his foreign co. are under
no sort of obligation to push their lines
out into newly-settled districts. On the con-
SPECIALLY SELECTED.
THE MANAGER (to seedy actor, who has just got a job on tour): "Look here, you know,
that's a terrible hat you're wearing! Haveen't you got another?"
THE SEEDY ONE: “Yes—two more."
MANAGER: “Well, I wish to goodness you'd wear one of them instead of that thing."
SEEDY ONE (with confidence): “Oh, no, you wouldn't—not if you. saw them!"
trary, the fool-Parliament which gave Bad-
ger’s co. its rights, distinctly encouraged
Badger to confine himself to the crowded
parts and do no-development w’ork at all.
It practically gave the foreign Badger’s for-
eign co. a free fling till 1920 —and when a
foreign co. and a foreign manager have a
free fling till 1920, who wouldn’t expect
them to kick, if they thought kicking paid
best? Unfortunately, the 1895 Parliament
is dead, else Brisbane might get some satis-
faction out of a little vigorous kicking exer-
cise too.
The Denham Government pours money out
to get immigrant population; and then it
subsidises institutions to pay for advts. like
this: —

WANTED MARRIED COUPLE for above, Wife Cook-
Laundress and General; Man, Wardsman ajid General
Useful. No encumbrances. Salary £lOO per annum.
Applications accompanied with testimonials will be
received by the Secretary up to Ist February.
Now, what is Denham going to do about it?
“Stingaree”: The death rate has been
high amongst N.Q. country papers during
the past few years, and the chap who put
up the shutters generally said nasty things
about the Herald and the Register, the
two big weeklies, which, owing to their bud-
get df country notes, were a hippopotamus in
the path \of the country rag. Wherefore,
when the N.Q. Herald recently ceased to
exist, the small Outback sheet drowned its
joy in beer. The Herald had been in exist-
ence for 40 years, and at one time owned a
wide circulation. E. J. Banfield, author of
“Confessions of a Beachcomber” and “My
Tropic Isle,” was its editor before he began
to Crusoe on Dunk Island, but of late it
had fed too much on large scissored slabs
and had grown sickly. The N.Q. Register,
hitherto printed at Charters Towers, hns
shifted itself into the Herald’s office at
Townsville, and an increase in size makes
it a highly-respectable sixpenn’orth.
Martin’s Pills are sold by all Chemists and
Stores in Australasia. Ladies recommend
them. Be sure you get the genuine with the

Queensland Railway Department has
just erected a large dining-room at Ipswich
for its employees, and has engaged to pro-
vide a daily dinner of three courses at a
head. Over the menu the Commissioner
proudly flaunts the. Scriptural command:
“Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he
treadeth out the corn.”
Dilating upon the tramway strike in
Brisbane, and, of course, assuming that the
men must be in the wrong, the S. M. Herald
sagely observed: —
It is quite possible that the unionist employees of
the Brisbane Tramway Company do not really grasp
the very wise reason that lies behind the regulation
against the wearing of badges. . . .
Which is mighty solemn and awesome, but
very ineffective, because tlie_ Herald forgot
to mention what the “very wise reason” hap-
pens to be. It is a thousand pities it did
not, because the employees in William
McLinen’s warehouse would then have known
what to say in case they should wait upon
William to insist that he should no longer
wear his badges of boss-dom, which are a
title and a silk hat.

The Brisbane tramway lock-out illus-
trates the foolishness of allowing public
works to depend on Private Enterprise. Cer-
tain Government offices, railway stations,
gaols and factories draw their power from
the local Tramways Co. Why should
the community depend on the caprice of Ten
per Shent, or have to shiver when he
muddles into a family quarrel?
Queensland’s dead-and-gone Railway Com-
missioner didn’t strike a winner when he
decided to experiment with a road train of
French pattern. Introduced to operate on
bad roads in districts wljiere railways did
not exist, the road train was hung up nearly
a year pending the construction of a track
suitable for it. After running for a few
■weeks, it qualified for the hospital, where its
elephantine bulk now peacefully reposes.
And the bill is said to be colossal.

Way for Badger, strong, resourceful,

With a leavening of Cromwell,
i Lo ! he stands lorth, stark, sardonic,
Like some vast, cold, Gothic steeple
Shadowing the Common People.
Only yester-week our Hero
Hurried to his daily labors,
As unnoticed as the shop-hand,
Or the clerk, his humble neighbors.
With his bag and gamp and paper
Badger might have been a draper.
Who imagined, watching Badger,
As he sprinted every morning
(Barring Sundays) to his office,
That here went a Human Warning,
Against Labor’s selfish strivings
And unprincipled connivings ?
Yet, beneath that neat, black bowler
All the time a Brain lay hidden:
And the fancy vest of Badger
Warmed no mean heart, fashion-ridden,
But an epic apparatus,
Filled with soldierly afflatus.
Wherefore (yet again, I urge it),
Way for Badger, the Preserver,
Laud this large-brained, dauntless fighter
And unflinching Rights-conscrver.
Leap with loyal zeal and cheer, oh
Cheer our new-found “Lib’ral” hero.

H. SINGEMOINE.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, January 27, 1912.
My Dear Tiiargomindah,—
The Governor departed to on
Monday, with the Foxton aide ana Walker,
Minister for Agriculture, in c'ow. Farms,
orchards, schools and lunches met with the
party’s entire approval, and his Ex. has
hopes of again scaling a few of the hills
and other festivities in that district. Among
the incidentals of the trip was a German
waggon ride, and an enterprising female
snapped his Ex. and the Walker man at an
agonising moment, when both were in mid-
air, awaiting the slump.
On Tuesday next the Macgregor will pro-
ceed to Pittswortli, to open the usual show.
Lady Mac. will lend an official'Smile for the
occasion.
Agent-General Robinson has come through
two more feeds —one at the Johnsonian Club
and the other at the Queensland Club —with
flying appetite. At both the official farewell
word was spoken, and every wineglass was
dim with tears of drink. The A.-G. and his
wife are cooling off at Boombali, where. the
Ross-Munros bloom. Presently they will
take the back track to London.
Mrs. Agent-General assisted Mrs. Gov-
ernoress, on Thursday, to distribute smiles
and roses to the children in the hospital.
By the departure of Captain Martyn, who
left for Westralia on Thursday, the local
military lost another ornament, but not be-
fore he had shed, for the last time, his
lustre upon a theatre party of fair women
and brave men. The Naval and Military
Club twirled the merry bowl in his honor
on Wednesday.
The Fifth Contingent of Queenslanders, which
helped to bring about the South African
Union (of which Boer General Louis Botha
is Premier), gathered together the other
night, and, between drinks, asked questions
as to what had become of the Patriotic
Fund? No answer being forthcoming, the
gathering could only ruminate darkly.
At time of writing, my dear, a general
strike of trades unionists is contemplated,
in antagonism to the stubbornness of
one Badger, who is accused of managing
Brisbane’s trams. -If you don’t hear from
me next week, you’ll know I’m busy foraging
for the family cupboard. It is when the
butchers and bakers and milkmen and so on
down tools that women are such a drag on
the community. Men or>n eat beer, and
thrive on it, but I doubt if I could manage
it, although a pal of mine says it is very
succulent with pepper and vinegar.
On the Lucinda, to-day, the Hospital Sat-
urday Association regaled those pirates of
the pavement who had cleaned out the town
last August. Tea and music were the prin-
cipal distractions.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
“P.F.” : Queensland Government is in an
awful funk about its Western Railway ex-
tensions. Drought is raging over huge areas,
and the water question alone will preclude
further operations, unless a general rain
soon happens.

Niggers in this country are supplied to stations
through the Protector at (say) 10s. per week and
found in everything. The buck (or doe, as the case
may be) receives 6s. The balance is paid to the
Protector or his agent. Can you tell me and a host
of others who would like to know, vthere the ss. gets
to? The constable (who is usually the agent) tells
you it is held in an account for the individual. Have
you ever known of a buck going to a police office
and asking how his account stood? Or receiving any
of the goods it is supposed to be stuffed with?
The Denham Government has some of the
wisdom of the serpent. During the last two
sessions it paid Dave Bowman his full Oppo-
sition-leader’s salary of £5OO, and paid
Deputy-leader Lennon at the same rate,
while Parliament was in session. Also, a
hint is given that, if returned to power, it
wouldn’t mind putting up the ordinary Par-
liamentary screw, provided the Labor party
will raise the question!
Trouble has been a permanent lodger on
the Rockhampton Harbor Board’s premises
of late. A few months ago the hardy sea-
men of the Board’s one dredge claimed in-
creased pay and other oddments; but they
did it through their union, and the Board
didn’t know the union, and away back in
November said it didn’t want to. It w T as
quite willing to give the men what they
wanted, but the men wouldn’t - look at the
Board or its good intentions except through
the union. So the dredge was laid up, and
the river began to do its best to fill itself
with sand. The majority of the estimable
gentlemen who form the Board —mostly
drapers, grocers and other Columbuses and
experts in the management of rivers—see
they must back down; but there are stal-
warts among them (one, in a telling speech,
said “many unionists had been proved to be
selfish, cruel, vindictive, destructive and
wicked”), so matters are still hung up,
while the river keeps on attending strictly
to the business of suffocating itself.

'Of secrecy about it:; vve describe it fully and
•explain just how it .acts.
You use spectacles as sight magnifiers, and
in the siime way you may use this sound
magnifier as an aid to weak hearing. But,
unlike spectacles, the Wilson Common-sense
Bar-Drums are invisible and comfortable.
You can’t tell you are wearing them. No
one else can, either, because they are not
seen.
They rest the ear nerves by taking the
strain off them —the strain of trying to hear
dim sounds. What a blessed relief to have
done with that tiring strain!
Being made of the purest and softest Para
rubber, they cannot be felt, even when the
head rests on a pillow. For the same reason,
a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. In fact, they protect the ear, the
tender inner parts that are so sensitive, from
cold winds, dust, sudden and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearlv understand why
these facts arc true, and why the Sound Mag-
nifier restores the hearing, we give an illus-
tration of one as it lies in the ear. You will
notice that the Sound Magnifier is shaped
like a trumpet, and so conveys even the
faintest sounds right to the natural ear-
drum. Being of the softest rubber, it cannot
hurt the ear. It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort. The division
that runs across the mouth is to allow the re*-
moval; and insertion of the Ear-Drum, and to
brace it. 1
The shape of the Wilson Ear-Drum has
been chosen after years of experience as the
best adapted to carry the faintest sound right
down, to the natural ear-drum.
To, persons who are nearly deaf,-it. is not
only trying to .have 'people shout at them,
but it hurts the ear-drum. When age conics
the ear-drum sometimes gets thickened, or
loses ,its tightness, and shouting does not act
properly, on it. It only makes a confused
and tiring noise. But the Sound Magnifiers
concentrate tlie sound in the best spot for
perfect bearing.
Of course, if you have lost the hearing-
nerve completely, or. were born deaf, we can-
not pretend' to euro you. Onlv a miracle
could do . that, in spite of some of the absurd
claims made to-day. But if you can hear the
faintest sound, do not despair. You will
never regret trying the Wilson Ear-Drums.
We have letters to show i'ou from deaf people
in Australia and New Zealand who have been
cured, and you can he cured, too. You may
wear the Ear-Drums day and night, and take
them out whenever you wish. Children can
wear them (we have special sizes for children
from six to twelve). Even a child can insert
and remove them without the least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s
single visit). This includes a pair of Drums
(they are only sold in pairs), a fine nickel
remover and also an inserter. After the first
pair is bought you may purchase a single
drum at any time for 85.,, but the pair you
get at first will last quite two vears. Do not
ask for a trial pair. We do not send them
out on trial, and so they 'are never second-
hand. Use the Order Form below, and the
Outfit will be sent to you at once, with the
fullest instructions. Don’t, delay, but have
the comfort of good bearing as soon as you
can.

Thcßoyal Commission
in their final report on Tuberculosis,
recently issued, clearly showed that
the chief danger to child life resulted
from the use of infected cow’s milk.
To quote one extract : “The Evi-
dence we have accumulated goes to
demonstrate that a considerable
amount of the tuberculosis of child-
hood is to be ascribed to infection
transmitted to children in meals
consisting largely of the milk of
the cow.”
When the mother’s milk is not
available, the “Allenburys” Foods
form the best substitute, as they are
practically, identical-with healthy human milk
in composition, nutritive value and digestibility,
K.and are absolutely free from all harmful germs.

Mr. William Longworth, the World’s
Records breaker, the noted Rose Bay
Swimmer, Champion of New South Wales
all distances from 100 yards to 3 miles,
and 1 mile ; Australasian Cham-
pion, and World’s Record Holder ;
1 mile and 3 miles; also 100 metres Aus-
tralia’s record, who has defeated such
famous swimmers as Beaurepaire, Healy,
Hardwick and Solomons, is undoubtedly
to-day Australia’s greatest swimmer.

were largely accountable for the winning
of the Kieran Shield for New South Wales,
which is the most valued swimming
trophy in Australasia.

worth, Australia’s greatest
Swimming Champion, is a
matter of much interest to

ence. He writes as follows:
WILLIAM
LONG WORTH
(From May Moore,

THE MANAGER, Rexona. December 15, ign.
Dear Sir, —I want to add my endorsement to your famous Rexona Ointment. I have
been training with Rexona for some time past with the greatest success, both as a rub-down
. -after swimming, and as an application before swimming. I have found it invaluable, for
it not only removes any stiffness, but prevents one from being cold when in the water, and I
am sure its use has helped to increase my speed.
Yours truly, WILLIAM LONG WORTH.
ALL ATHLETES NEED REXONA

Chilblains, Chapped Hands, Sciatica, Itching or Bleeding Piles, Cuts, Burns, Bruises, Scalds, Bad Legs,

formity with their actions are being drafted into
such service as the medical corps and commissariat
department. —News item.
THE field guns’ thunder slackened and
died—shells ceased to fly from their
blackened throats;
A tremor ran through the resting lines the
bugles flung imperative notes;
Then up from the ground the soldiers sprang
and started off through the long, dry
grass;
The parched plain whispered beneath their
feet a battle prayer as it felt them pass.
Steadily forward the Young Guard went,
their keen, brown faces all stern and
set,
In open order with shouldered arms, for
those they sought were afar —as yet;
And as they walked to the waiting death,
one spied some waggons behind a rise.
“Buck up,” he shouted. “You Quakers
there! We’ll keep ’em off you, so dry
your eyes!”
Loud laughter rippled along the ranks. An
ambulance driver waved his hand ;
Like sweeping combs to some ugly work far,
far in front went that mocking band.
The heat beat down on the watching troops ;
the distanqe swallowed them; all was
still. . .
At last! The crack of rifles ran along the
slopes of the long grey hill!
The fire increased as the seconds fled; in
gusts of anger the rifles spoke;
The watchers far to the rear saw naught but
dots and billows of drifting smoke.
The fight developed—it snarled and roared!
In spurts and dashes its rage increased !
“They’re gettin’ it now!” a trooper said.. .
Like a fall of hail, the firing ceased.
“They’ve beaten them!” cried the watching
men, and laughed at echoes of parting
shots.
“Well, what th’ Devil is that?” asked one,
and waved his hand at approaching
dots.
The long lines turned at the angry shout;
a bugle sounded. “ They’re in retreat!”
The grey plain rustled in agony. The grim
reserves were upon their feet!
No jests were bandied as they moved off.. .
And none were made as they straggled
back,
Stretcher-bearers trudging along with bur-
dens picked from the haunted track.
“What, Quaker, old boy! A job at last?”
said a sneering Guardsman standing by.
The stretcher-bearer looked up and smiled.
“And doing it!” came the quick reply.
That night the army fell back in haste; a
shallow stream in the dark it crossed;
And on a crescent of hills entrenched to face
an enemy reinforced;
A week must pass ere the trains could bring
more regiments up o’er the broken track ;
The riffemen cursed the breaks of gauge, and
grimly waited the foe’s attack.
’Twas just at dawn on the second day,
when over the river the guns began;
The Guardsmen lay in their shallow trench,
silent and stern while the thunders ran ;
The whining shells in their faces burst, and
gashed the face of the hills deep red;
The ambulance bearers moved about —but
never a word the soldiers said.
Long, long they rested upon their arms —an
eager, suffering, league-long line,
Ere somebody shouted, “Here they come!”
The young eyes noted the bayonets
shine ;
A moment of waiting. . .Sharp commands!
The rifles leapt at the swift desire!
The long hills split with a rending crash —
’mid smoke and fury the world ran fire!
Then up through the smoke the squat forms
rushed. The long lines crumbled like
surges spent;
But back again to the charge they came —
for lo ! the prize was a continent!
The Guardsmen sweated at pumping lead —
they saw the standards before them
reel!
A last “Banzai!” and the charge drove
home!- —it was butt to butt and steel
to steel!
A Guardsman, fighting amid the press,
caught one brief glimpse of a demon
who
Was killing hard with the butt. “ Good God!
Good on you, Quaker! Good luck to
you !”
A moment later the fight was lost! The
brown wave passed with a mighty
heave!
A soldier lay in the trench of Death—the
Red Cross glowed on his bloodstained
sleeve!

E. FRANCIS.
A Question of Compensation.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ TT ER’LL git picked up er mangled
corpse one o’ these fine days, if yer
ain’t carefuller, Jerry,” prophe-
sied Mr. Sharp, as the breathless Mr. Maun-
der reached the side-walk after a spirited
sprint.
The ancient followed the receding motor-
car with protruding eyes.
“Another ’arf a inch an’ I’d ’ave ’ad the
Lor on the cow,” he declared. “Carn’t crost
the road nowadays without bein’ in a ace o’
run down by one o’ them stinkin’ Jugger-
nuts.”
“Well, yer ’eard ’em ’ootin’ fit ter bust
’emselves, didn’t yer?” inquired Mr. Sharp
disdainfully. “Why don’t yer take the cot-
ton-wool outer yer ears, mate?”
“I see in the paper on’y day afore yester-
day, ’ow a bloke wot ’ad bin knocked down
be one o’ them thin’s got two ’undered p’und
reward,” continued Mr. Maunder, intent on
his grievance. “He weren’t so very much
’urt, either —f’actured ’is —’is —somethin’ or
other, I fergit wot they called it.”
“Good wheeze that,” commented Mr.
Sharp. “Yer might do worse, Jerry. It
wouldn’t cost yer nothink while yer was in
horsepittle, an’ when yer come out ag’in
yer’d ’ave more money ter blew than ever yer
seen in orl yer born days. Why not give it
a trial, matey?”
Mr. Maunder surveyed his companion in
speechless indignation.
“Jest think o’ ’avin’ a gentle-’anded, ten-
derhearted nuss in a clean white cap an’
apron to bring you yer beef-tea an’ jellies,
an’ yer port an’ sherry wine,” went on Mr.
Sharp, with enthusiasm. “A luverly young
gal wot ’ud soothe yer troubled pillar, an’
’old that big, red nose o’ yers reg’lar three
times a day while yer swallered yer ’ealin’
physics. There’s many a pore feller ’ud be
on’y too glad o’ the chance, an’ not arsk a
’a’penny fer ’is suff’rin’s.”
“Ho, indeed,” said Mr. Maunder coldly.
“I wonder yer don’t take it on yer own self,
Sam, as yer seem ter fancy it so.” .
Sam shook his head. “I’m younger than
wot you are, Jerry,” he explained, “an’ if be
any chance the injuries did prove fatal, why
it ’ud be far, far ’arder fer me to go than it
would be fer you—an ole man wot carn’t ex-
peck to larst much longer under no circum-
stances. ’Arf a mo,” he added quickly, quell-
ing with soothing hand the venomed retort
that rose to Mr. Maunder’s lips. “I’ve a
little idea, mate. I’m afraid the horsepittle
part o’ the bisness carn’t be managed, but I
lay we could clear enough to make the game
worth our while. I’ve a pal, Jerry—’Enery
Jukes, ’is name is, bin well eddicated ’as
’Enery, ’e were at the Universally, one time,
but come down in the world, owin’ to the
drink. Well, ’e’s ole man Bunter’s —the
sorce an’ pickle bloke’s —chaffer, drives ’is
motor-car fer ’im. I reck’n ’Enery ’ud come
in orright on shares. Say we gotter ’undered
an’ fifty jims—that ’ud be fifty apiece. The
on’y thin’ you’d ’ave to do, Jerry, ’ud be to
lay abed fer a few days, an’ if ole Bunter
’appened to come along—good-’earted ole bloke,
so ’Enery ses —yer’d jest pull some o’ them
hid jus faces o’ yers an’ let out a ’oiler groan
now an’ then —same as yer does of a night-
time arter eatin’ crayfish.”
“If yer carn’t tork sensible, fer ’eaven’s
sake keep yer face shut, Sam,” requested Mr.
Maunder with acerbity. “Wotever are yer
drivin’ at, any’ow?”
“ ’Enery’s gin’rally in the Chequers ’bout
this time,” continued Mr. Sharp, unheedingly.
“Let’s nip acrost an’ see ’im, Jerry; an’
don’t fergit it’s your shout, mate.”
Mr. Ephraim Bunter sat in his library, and
listened with concern, and ill-concealed im-
patience, to his chauffeur’s tale of disaster.
“I did everything in my power to avert
the catastrophe, sir, concluded Mr. Jukes.
“It seems the old man is very hard of hear-
ing.”
“Is he badly injured?” snapped Mr. Bun-
ter.
“I really couldn’t say, sir,” responded the
chauffeur. “After the accident I took him
to his home in Silver-street, and left him
under the care of a friend of his —a highly-
respectable young man, Sharp by name.”
“It’s extremely unfortunate,” said Mr.
Bunter irritably. “Why couldn’t you have
been more careful, Jukes? I did think I
could trust you.”
Mr. Jukes coughed deferentially behind his
hand.
“This is the first mishap I have had since
I entered your service, sir,” he reminded his
employer.
“I sincerely hope it will be the last—-a
most inopportune affair,” said Mr. Bunter,
curtly. “The annoying part of it is I must
leave for Hobart to-morrow. An inquiry
must be avoided. I don’t want my name
dragged into the business. Well, I suppose
it is a mere question of compensation.” He
glanced at the clock. “Bring the car round
in half an hour, Jukes; I shall just have
time to run down before dinner to —to —
Silver-street, did you say? Why didn’t you
take this man Mordaunt—Maunder—what-
ever his name is, direct to the hospital? He
would have stood a far better chance under
proper medical supervision.”
“I did suggest the hospital, sir,” replied
the thoughtful Mr. Jukes, “but the poor old
man wouldn’t hear of it —said he wanted to
die in the arms of his friend. It was really
quite affecting, I can assure you.”
“The antipathy displayed by the lower
orders to our excellent public and benevolent
institutions is simply deplorable,” grunted
Mr. Bunter. “Well, never mind; the car
in half an hour, Jukes.”
He turned to his writing-table, and the
chauffeur quitted the room, the ghost of a
smile upon his face.
“If you don’t stop in bed an’ keep yerself
covered up warm, yer’ll git ’orrible complica-
tions, Jerry,” observed Mr. Sharp, looking
up from the newspaper. “Remember, the
’ind wheel went right over yer empty
stummick, mate. It’s a marvel to me yer
alive at this identical moment.”
“Well, ’ow long d’yer reck’n I’m goin’ to
lay ’ere watchin’ you drink bottle beer an’
never even arstin’ me to ’ave so much as a
’arf a glass?” inquired Mr. Maunder, glow-
ering wrathfully out of a blanket.
Mr. Sharp drank his comrade’s speedy re-
covery in a full glass of ale.
“The doctor’s orders was no spiritus or
fomented lickers—on’y milk an’ sodas,” he
remarked complacently. “If I was to weakly
satisfy yer hawful cravin’s fer strong drink.
Jerry, I’d bp no better than a murderer- yer
blood ’ud be on my ’ands, mate.”
Mr. Maunder’s whiskers quivered with
rage.
“I s’pose yer think yer very funny.” he
said in a voice choked with emotion. “Any
rate, I ain’t goin’ to lay ’ere no longer. The
ole bloke won’t turn up now —it’s pretty
near arf-past six as it is. Don’t reck’n ’e’il
come at orl; ’Enery ses ’e’s off to ’Obart ter-
morrer. ’Sides, I promised Loo Copper I’d
meet ’er at the Feathers, eight o’clock.” He
swung a pair of lengthy legs over the side of
the bed, and fumbled ofi the floor.
“ ’Ere, git back, else I’ll chuck this bottle
at yer—it’s empty,” exclaimed Mr. Sharp.
“Yer delirious, mate, that’s wot’s the matter
with you ; the fever is a-mountin’ to yer pore
addled brains. If yer go on this way yer’ll
’ave to ’ave a straight-weskit. Git back to
bed this minute —d’yer ’ear me?”
Mr. Maunder turned a convulsed face
upon his hostile friend. “Wot yer done
with me trowsis, Sam?” he demanded feroci-
ously.
Mr. Sharn grinned. “Was them yer trow-
sis, Jerry?” he said incredulously. “Very

IN SUMMER?
RASH, SUNBURN. ITCHY SKIN, SORE FEET AND
KINDRED SKIN TROUBLES SOOTHED AND HEALED.
Summer’s heat and glare induce all sorts of
itching, smarting, irritating skin troubles,
owing either to excessive perspiration, over-
heating or dryness, and sunburn, heat swell-
ings, rashes, prickly heat (summer itcli),
pruritis, pimples and blotches cause pain and
annoyance to both housewife and breadwinner.
Face, neck, arms, body and legs—whichever
part of the skin tissue happens to be weakest—
are all liable to be attacked by these tingling,
burning, irritating skin troubles, and the way
to cure them and
to apply dressings of Zam-Buk.
The soothing, herbal juices of Zam-Buk are
naturally absorbed by the skin, thus purifying
the pores, strengthening the tissues, and im-
parting a degree of health to the skin that
enables it to resist the evil effects of summer
heat and chafing winds. It is impossible to get
relief from ordinary ointments, salves, lotions
or cosmetics, largely composed of rancid
animal irritants and fatty mineral substances,
because they tend only to aggravate skin
trouble. Zam-Buk is so constituted that when
applied to the skin it becomes Nature’s ally in
the work of dispelling disease and restoring
the skin to health.
SORE FEET.
Mrs. Gunson, of 157 Hoddle
Street, West Richmond, Mel-
bourne, writes :—“ I am a
canvasser, and am onstantly on my feet. My
insteps became tender and broke out in
sores. I applied different lotions, but they utterly
failed to give relief. Seeing Zam-Buk advertised,
I procured a pot, and the sores were healed, and
the burning, irritating feeling left my feet.”
ITCHING, IRRITATING RASH.
“Last summer,” says Mr. J. Parker, of H 5
Alice Street, Newtown, Sydney, “ a rash broke
out all over tnv body. I bathed my body with
different solutions, but could gain no relief. Re-
membering I had Zam-Bukin the house I applied
it, and after two applications all the irritation
disappeared. I continued the treatment for three
days, by which time the rash had completely
vanished.”
EVERYBODY NEEDS ZAM-BUK.
ZAM-BUK is a healing, soothing anti antiseptic healer, and is invaluable for cuts, burns, bruises,
scalds rashes, prickly heat, insect bites, sunburn, peeling cheeks and noses, sore, aching feet,
smarting patches, eczema, pruritis, piles, and all injuries of the skin and tissues. 1/6 per pot, or
3/6 family size, of all chemists and stores, or from the Zam-Buk Co., 39 Pitt Street, Sydney.

sorry, mate, but while yer was asleep Mrs.
1 ratt came knockin’ at the door, an’ arstin’
me if I ’ad any old rags I didn’t want, as
she was a-goin' to mend the winder ’er ole
man put ’is elber through t’other night when
in licker. I didn’t reckermse they was
trowsis —I thought they was on’y a bit o’
sack in wot you ’ad tore orf o’ the bed in yer
dreadful convulsions.”
iMr. Maunder had opened his lips to make
a response suitable to the occasion, when a
commotion in the street nipped his eloquence
m the bud. Above the squeals of the juvenile
populace sounded the impatient panting of a
motor. Sam craned his head out of the window,
then ran across the room and flung himself
upon the . recalcitrant Mr. Maunder.
“It’s ’im !” lie cried in a voice hoarse
with excitement. “I see’d the car an’ the
top o’ ’Enery’s ’ead. Will you git back inter
bed—blarst yer ! !”
“Well, gimme me trowsis!!” bawled the
enraged Mr. Maunder. There was a brief
struggle, in which the sansculotte, finding
himself overmatched, retired reluctantly be-
neath the blankets. Not "a moment too soon.
There came a knock at the door, and Mrs.
Pratt thrust an empurpled visage into the
apartment.
“A gen’leman to see Stinker —meantersay
Mr. Maunder,” she announced loftily.
■Mindful of his responsibilities, the invalid
here emitted such a dismal groan that the
portly Mr. Hunter paused in consternation
upon the threshold.
Mr. Sharp bustled forward with a coun-
tenance in which grief and anticipation were
’ • ' blended. He shooed the officious
Mrs. Pratt out on to the landing, and, shut-
ting the door on her acrimonious reproaches,
turned to the visitor.
“Won’t yer sit down, sir? ’Appy to see
yer,” he began. “Yer Dr. Wigg’s partner,
I persoome.”
“No, no, my good man; nothing of the
kind,” replied Mr. Bunter nervously. “I
am the owner of the car that ran over your
unfortunate friend this morning. I have
come to express my sincere sorrow for the
regrettable incident, and also to see if I can-
not do anything to mitigate the sufferings of
the poor fellow. Is that he on the bed yon-
der? Dear me, this is very dreadful.”
It was indeed. The zealous Mr. Maunder
was inclined to over-emphasise his part.
Sam struggled with his feelings, chief among
which was a burning desire to make his col-
league groan in real earnest.
“The wheel went right over ’is stummick,
sir; that’s wot makes ’im carry on like this
’ere,” he whispered. “I must give ’im ’is
drops wot Dr. Wigg said as ’e was to take
reg’lar ev’ry ’arf hour.” lie took from the
mantelpiece a medicine bottle which he had
previously filled with unsweetened gin, and
held it to the sufferer. “ ’Ere, don’t scoff it
orl,” he murmured ; “an’ fer Gaw’s sake stop
that hidius moanin’ noise o’ yers—the ole
bloke an’ me carn’t ’ear ourselves speak.”
"I should think the poor fellow would be
better off in hospital,” said Mr. Bunter, who
was watching Sam’s ministrations with ap-
proval.
Mr. Sharp made an expressive gesture.
“So ’e would, sir,” he agreed; “on’y ,’e carn’t
abear the idea. Yer see, sir, ’is pore father
an’ mother both died o’ burns in the accident
ward, owin’ to a sperrit-lamp wot was ‘it
be a boot, an’ Jerry’s fust words to me, when
they brought ’im in ’ere an’ lay ’im down
on ’is sulf’rin’ bed was: ‘Not the horsepittle,
Sam, not the horsepittle, mate.’ Dr. Wigg
said as ’ow ’e must be humored, so we let ’im
stop where ’e was.”
“Well, I’m sure it reflects great credit on
you,” remarked Mr. Bunter rather vaguely.
Mr. Sharp wouldn’t hear of it. “Not at
orl, sir,” he said with great feeling; “if that
pore ole man was to snatch it —meantersay,
depart this life, it ’ud break me ’eart. ’E’s
bin more’n a father to me —together we’ve
shared our latest crust, an’ together we’ve
drunk the waters of affection —which was a
verse wot I learnt at the Sunny-school as a
hoy, sir, goin’ there reg’lar an’ winnin’ the
prize fer attendance three year runnin’.”
“Very creditable, indeed,” commented Mr.
Bunter, who was beginning to show signs of
impatience. He walked over to the bedside
and prodded the invalid tentatively with a
fat forefinger.
Mr. Maunder groaned. Mr. Bunter tell
back a pace or two.
“My poor fellow,” he said concernedly,
“do you think you can understand what I am
about to say to you?” ■
“One ’undered an’ fifty p’und, ’ murmured
Mr. Maunder dreamily.
’’Don’t take no notice of ’im—els delirious,
sir,” put in the agitated Mr. Sharp. ”E
thinks ’e’s a boy at scliol ag’in, a-doin’ of ’is
sums on a bitter slate. Anythink you wish
to say, sir, will be repeated to ’im voracious
like, when ’e comes to ’is census. ’
Mr. Bunter consulted his watch. “I had
no idea it was so late. Look here, Sharp
that is your name, isn’t it? I am leaving
for Hobart to-morrow, otherwise I should
have made a point of seeing the physician
concerning the extent of the injuries sus-
tained by this unfortunate fellow. I have
no intention of attempting to evade my lia-
bilities, so I am going to hand you, on behalf
of your friend, £5O as a preliminary com-
passionate grant. When I return to Mel-
bourne, in a month’s time, I will make fur-
ther inquiries, and if I find that my moral
and legal responsibilities exceed that sum, I
shall be quite ready and willing to face
them. I have not the £5O with me, but I
will send you under sealed cover 10 bank-
notes for £5 apiece. My chauffeur shall
bring them some time to-morrow morning—
he is a man in whom I place great confi-
dence. Do you consider that this arrange-
ment will meet the exigencies of the case?”
Mr. Sharp strove to express the acknow-
ledgments of himself and Mr. Maunder in a
few faltering words. Jerry, among the
blankets, diligently worked short sums in
simple subtraction.
“Fifty from er ’undered an’ fifty’s ought
an’ a ought an’ a one —one ’undered p’und,”
he calculated.
In a spasm of fury, Sam shook his fist
surreptitiously at the mathematician.
“Well, good evening,” continued Mr. Bun-
ter. “I must hurry away now. To-mor-
row morning my man shall bring you the
money. Take every care of the patient, and
spare no expense, mind.”
As the throbs of the motor-car died away
in tiie distance, Sam, after frigidly repelling
the advances of the curious Mrs. Pratt, re-
turned to the room. He found the interest-
ing invalid sitting up in bed, apparently on
the highroad to a complete recovery o£ every-
thing except his missing pants.
“Well, wodger think o’ that for a fair ole
rook, Jerry?” lie inquired triumphantly.
“Fifty jims, mate! You didn’t do too bad,
on’y you overdone it a bit.”
Mr. Maunder, on all fours, groped beneath
the bed.
“If yer don’t give me me trowsis this min-
ute, Sam, I’ll ’ave to go out as I am, an’ so
I tell yer,” he grunted.
“Yer mind’s wanderin’, matey—-’ave some
more o’ them little drops,” said Mr. Sharp
soothingly.
The following morning, Henry Jukes de-
scended from Mr. Bunter’s car at the door
of No. 5 Silver-street. “And how’s the poor
sufferer this morning?” he inquired affably,
as he loosened his heavy coat and divested
himself of his goggles.
“Gettin’' on nicely, thank’ee, ’Enery,” re-
sponded Mr. Sharp with a grin. “Made a
good, hearty brekfuss off o’ sossidges, an’
wanted to know wot we was a-goin’ to give
’im fer ’is dinner.”
“I’ve just dropped the guv’nor at the
docks,” resumed Mr. Jukes, “he’s sailed by
this time. Thought I’d look in on my way
home and see how you were both poppin’.”
Mr. Sharp coughed tentatively. “ ’Ow
about that ’ere sealed envelope, ’Enery?” he
asked insinuatingly. He pulled a scrap of
crumpled paper from his pocket and con-
sulted it anxiously. “Three’s inter fifty’s
£l6 13s. 4d. apiece, mate. Me an’ Jerry
worked it out between us. We sat up till
two o’clock this mornin’ a-doin’ of it. The
addle-’eaded ole alligator managed the pounds
orright, but when it come to the shillin’s an’
pence—Lor’ lumme !”
“What envelope’s that?” inquired Mr.
Jukes. He whistled nonchalantly, and bit
the end off a blunt cigar. “Got a light, i
Sam?”
“Why, the envelope containin’ the 10 five-
p’und banknotes wot the ole bloke’s partin’
up with as a perlim’ary compensation fer the
crool injuries wot yer capable carelessness
inflicted on pore old Jerry Maunder,” ex-
plained Mr. Sharp. “ ’Ere, don’t ’ank about,'
’Enery—you know jolly well wot I mean.”
“Oh, that,” responded Mr. Jukes. “Y"es.
Fact is, Sam, when it came to the point I
found I couldn’t do it. I’ve always lived
honestly so far, and I’m not going to perjure
my immortal soul for fit! odd. So when the
guv’nor gave me the envelope to give to you,
I told him straight that I’d made further in-
quiries, and had every reason to believe that
Jerry wasn’t nearly as bad as lie’s been try-
ing to make out. I didn’t give the whole
show away, mind you —I never round on my
cobbers; but I advised the boss to hold the
matter over until he got back from Hobart.
It was a shock to the poor old chap, I’m
afraid ; lie spoke quite bitterly of the futility
of trusting to appearances. Well, I’m
just as glad now that we didn’t take him
down. He’s a kind-hearted old chap, and —
and —oh, well, the affair’s off, Sam, so
there’s an end of it. Here are your matches,
thanks.” He blew a cloud of cigar smoke
with an air of virtuous satisfaction.
“Ho, it’s off, is it?” ejaculated Mr. Sharp.
“Orright, ’Enery, you see if I don’t show
you up quick ’n’ lively when the old ’un
comes home !”
“Talk sense, talk sense,” entreated Mr. ;
Jukes. “You can’t show me up, Sam, with-
out giving yourself away 10 times over.
Nice airy little room this ,of yours. What
rent do you pay, if it isn’t a rude question?”
“I b’lieve yer fellin’ a pack o’ lies,” went
on the fuming Sam. “I b’lieve yer stickin’
to the 50 jims the ’ole time, you ’erring-
gutted, schnapper-faced shark, you !”
Mr. Jukes dashed his cigar on the floor.
He wrenched off his heavy overcoat and flung
it recklessly from him.
“If you’re looking for trouble, come on!” ;
he cried valorously. “I’ll herring-gut you! j
Call me a thief, eh? Come on, and I’ll put
heads on the pair o’ you!”
He sparred scientifically at Mr. Sharp. ,
Jerry, who had been strangely silent. since |
Mr. Jukes’s arrival, here intervened in the j
blessed role of peacemaker. He picked up
the discarded overcoat and patted the war- |
like chauffeur gently on the back.
“There, there, ’Enery,” he said, soothingly, i
“Don’t take no notice of ’im an’ ’is wicked
words. ’E’ll be sorry fer ’em later on.”
“He’ll be sorry for ’em now, this very
minute, if he’ll only put up his props like a
bloomin’ man,” vouchsafed Mr. Jukes shortly.
“Lemme ’elp yer on with yer luverly fash’n-
able greatcoat; ’Enery,” urged the reconciler.
“You done quite right, matey, in not lettin’
the pore ole gen’leman rob ’isself. I felt the
same as you did meself arter ’e’d gorn. I
couldn’t sleep a wink the ’ole night long fer
thinkin’ ’ow crool an’ wrong it ’ud be to
impose on ’im. Gaud bless yer, mate, fer
doin’ wot yer done. It’ll be a lesson to us,
orl to our d.vin’ days.”
“Here, cheese it, and take your hands off
me,” growled Mr. Jukes, as he struggled into
his topcoat, assisted by the high-minded Mr.
Maunder. “I don’t want any of your jaw.”
He retrieved his cigar, and swaggered jaun-
tily across the room. At the door he turned
and surveyed the speechless Mr. Sharp with
a malevolent grin.
“I might as well tell you I got a letter ( '
this morning, advising me that an old maiden
aunt of mine has just died and left me a little j
legacy of £50,” he remarked casually.
“Rather a coincidence, eh? It seemed to
me like a reward for doing what was right by
the boss. I’m going to have a real good time j
in Svdney while he’s away. So long, Sam. !
Don’t get run over by any more motors, !
Jerry.”
He withdrew, slamming the door noisily
behind him, and the bitterness of Mr. Sharp’s
wrath and disappointment found vent in a
lava-flood of heated words.
•‘An’ you’re as bad as ’im,” he concluded,
swinging round on Mr. Maunder, who was
seated on the side of his bed, busy with some
crisp oaoers ; “roustin’ on me like —’ere, wot
yer fiddlin’ about with?”
Mr. Maunder shook his head reproach-
full v.
“Don’t fork ’arsh, Sam..” he implored;
“learn to bridle that ’ere ’asty tongue o’ yers.
Wot am I fiddlin’ about with? Why, 10
five-o’und banknotes, to be sure. Two’s inter
fifty’s twen’y-five—better than three’s inter
fifty’s sixteen —an’ —an’ the rest, eh, mate?”
“Wherever did yer git ’em from, Jerry?”
Mr. Maunder winked a solemn eye.
“It’s a little legacy wot a kind-’eatted gent
left me fer ’elpin’ ’im on with ’is fash’nable
topcoat, Sam,” he said softly. ' |

makes the following claims upon your attention
1— It uses cheap lamp oil (such as kerosene), and other residuals.
2 The oil is injected directly into the cylinder, thus dispensing with unre-
liable and inefficient vaporisers.
3 It is very simple in construction, there being no electric ignition or other
complicated mechanism.
4 Its speeds are such that electric generators and centrifugal pumps mav
be coupled direct.
5 No skilled labor is required, the supply of fuel and lubricant being all
the attention necessary.

WHY Every Farmer should
use ELECTRIC LIGHTS.
ELECTRIC LIGHT is the only modem method of illumination for all purposes. Electric
lighting is specially adapted for use in farm-houses, stables, bams, where there is danger of
fires if coal, oil, acetylene or gas lamps are used.
If you live in the country, you know without our telling how much you need Electric Lights.
You already know how handy, clean and convenient electric lamps are, and you would, perhaps,
have installed them years ago if it had not been for the high cost of the old style, or for running
the wires out from the
nearest town.
You know how poor
oil lamps are, and how
you have to strain your
eyes trying to read, while
you inhale the kerosene
smoky atmosphere, and
the trouble to keep your
lamps clean. Your doe-
tor knows how unhealthy
your lamps are j your
decorator how it paye
him.
Electric Lights are
Absolutely Safe— No
Danger of Fire.
In almost every news-
paper you pick up, you
read of an explosion of
an acetylene gas plant or
a kerosene lamp falling
over or setting the
place on fire, often with
fatal results.
;
.
ELECTRIC LIGHTS ARE HANDY. Turn on the switch and there you have it. No hunting
for matches in the dark; no lights blowing out. You can have lights on the wall, ceiling, floor,
table, piano, stable, gate, bed-side; Electric Fans to keep you cool; Radiators to make you warm;
Electric Burglar Alarms; Bells. THE PRICES ARE IN REACH OF ALL.
FARMERS ARE ENTITLED TO THE CONVENIENCES OF THE CITY
Because of the wonderful state of development of the
WATSON ELECTRIC LIGHTING Sy stem
including the storage battery, dynamo, engine, lamps and switchboard, together with the low cost
of installation. We provide a storage battery, so that the electricity can be made whenever
convenient and kept ready for use. You, or one of your men, san attend'to the engine while doing
other work. One charge will give you enough current to run your lights nracticallv a week
WHAT IT COST TO RUN A WATSON OUTFIT.- The care and cperadmi of WaS' Farm-
house Lighting Outfit are so simple that anyone can readily learn. They are verv inexpensive
to install. The oost of operation is very low, both in fuel and attendance inexpensive
