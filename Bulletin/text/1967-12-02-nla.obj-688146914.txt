ONE MORE
WEEK
VANISHED HOPES
ADELAIDE, it seems, has once more
proved a graveyard of artistic hopes.
Mr. John Tasker is no longer with the
South Australian Theatre Company
and the long-term prospects of the
company are vague.
Weeks of rumors ended with a busi-
nesslike statement inserted in the centre
pages of the “Advertiser” by the acting
chairman of the South Australian
Theatre Company, Mr. Neil Hopkins,
that “Mr. John Tasker’s contract as
producer of the SATC had ended.”
to have been a dynamic
regional professional theatre company
able to take its place alongside the Old
Tote, Union Repertory, and Perth
National Theatre is after three years
virtually unknown to the Adelaide
theatre-going public. This is not the
fault of those productions it has under-
taken, but rather because it has no
theatre of its own and because public
or private, social or financial support
has never been sought by its policy-
makers.
Mr. Plopkins’ statement went on to
say that the company’s activities w'ould
be expanded by contracting local and
interstate producers, that the 1968
season would have five productions
spread from March to November, and
that a tour of the Northern Territory
would be undertaken.
Without a theatre, a permanent
director, an integrated company of
players, and a public, it would seem
that the most interesting performances
for some time will be in the company’s
board-room.
CHRONICLER OF THE JEWS
“RIGHT-THINKING people every-
where surely support Israel,” William
Frankel, editor of the London Jewish
“Chronicle,” told The Bulletin. “Who
could support a threat to wipe out an
entire nation?”
Mr. Frankel, with his cultured voice,
husky from a cold he caught in Hong
Kong, with his square moustache, thick
glasses, and blue suit, looked and
sounded very British. He admitted that
die circulation of his weekly newspaper,
the oldest and most widely read Jewish
newspaper in the world, had risen since
the development of the Middle East
crisis in May. “It would be disingenuous
to suggest we are not pro-Israel, but we
do not automatically follow the Israeli
Government line. We regard ourselves
as candid friends.”
On why the Arabs wanted to fight
from a position of weakness, he said
that the Arab was a strange person
who would cut off his nose to spite his
face. He said the Arab nations had
always competed with each other in
belligerence. Egypt had to shout louder
than Syria to maintain leadership. He
did not think Nasser had deliberately
put his head on the block, but
committed to competition with Syria.
The Western world, he said a little
bitterly, kept telling Israel: “You are a
reasonable people—don’t provoke any-
thing.” The Western powers started
from the point that the Arabs are
unreasonable, and then asked the
reasonable party to make the conces-
sions. “It’s happening in the United
Nations now. We can’t expect the
Arabs to make peace with Israel, so you
be magnanimous—why?”
Apart from the Middle East, which
at present occupied half of the news-
paper, Mr. Frankel said that the
“Chronicle” covered specifically Jewish
life throughout the world along the
news and feature lines of most news-
papers. “I try to make the paper give
an accurate, not a rose-tinted, picture.
We are the only Jewish newspaper to
have correspondents wherever there is
a Jewish community and our news-
paper circulates wherever people want
authoritative Jewish opinion, whether
it be the Arab world or Eastern
Europe. We are privately owned, in-
dependent of party or religion, and our
prosperity has guaranteed this. We are
the sole contemporary record of recent
Jewish history. You know, we were
reporting Jewish news from Australia
when we began in 1841, though I am
the first editor to come here.
“Our circulation is 60,000 in Britain,
where there are 150,000 Jews, so we
go to practically every Jewish family.
Our circulation elsewhere is only
15,000, but it goes to the opinion
formers, the leaders of the community;
in fact, most Jewish newspapers use it
as their main news source. We syndi-
cate daily a news bulletin and a
feature service. Some have suggested
the newspaper should be shifted to the
United States, where half of the
world’s 13 million Jews are, but the
Americans themselves like our style of
production. Americans have always had
some sort of admiration for English
writing of English.”
YOUNG HOPEFULS
NOEL COWARD’S warning to Mrs.
Worthington apparently goes unheeded
these days. Tom Brown, director of
the National Institute of Dramatic Art,
estimates that a total of 300 appli-
cants are being auditioned for NIDA’s
1968 first-year class of 46.
He has just spent ten days auditioning
prospective students in Melbourne,
Adelaide, Perth, and Hobart, and is
holding auditions this week in Syd-
ney, after which he goes to Brisbane.
He says the establishment of new cul-
tural centres and the proliferation of
home-grown television programs have
produced in Australia a new burst of
optimism about the theatre as a career.
Optimism, however, is not quite
enough for NIDA, which, if anything, is
more stringent in its demands upon
its students than it once was. Only one
third of those who complete the first
year pass into second year.
“It’s not that they don’t have the-
necessary enthusiasm,” says Mr. Brown.
“It’s more a case of the talent they
showed during the auditions not being
realised. We don’t say that they don’t
have talent just that they should
make a start in another way. The
demands of the profession are still very
stringent, even with the increase of
opportunity. But NIDA graduates
have always had a very good employ-
ment rate.”
Paradoxically, those who come from
areas where there is little or no “live”
theatre often do the most successful
auditions. “It may be that they have a
fresher approach. I don’t know but
about 25 percent of those who audition
are from country areas.”

THE TREND
STOPPERS
As another trendy year draws to its close, The Bulletin
would like to pay tribute to the un-trendy. Any fool
can start a trend. It takes real determination to try to
stop one. On this page we announce our Trend
Stoppers Awards for 1967.
1. In the Age of Legginess, of Twiggy, Shrimpton, and
Donyale Luna, it is a brave girl who still relies on busti-
ness. (This award to Sydney stripper Sandra Nelson.)
3. In yet another Age When Australia Came To Maturity,
we should not forget the pioneers who make their for-
tunes out of our past. (This award to Rolf Harris.)
4. In the Age of City Re-Building, what better than
to dream of the floridity of an earlier self-confidence?
(This award to the T. and G. Buildings.)


2. In the Age of an Asian Australia, there is still a place
for reminders of our European heritage. (This award to
the State Theatre, Sydney.)
5. In the Age of Contemporaneity, some of us have to
remember the virtues of tradition. (This award shared
by this year’s debutantes and Princess Soraya.)

ON THE
MARGIN
The uneasy road
from here to
maternity
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
THE IDEA THAT having babies is
fun is of recent origin. The experience
used to be regarded as pretty un-
pleasant. Most people assumed that
when God said to Eve: “In sorrow
shalt thou bring forth children,” He
knew what He was talking about. In
the past few decades, however, a school
of medical thinking, led by Dr. Grant-
ley Dick Read and others, has main-
tained that the hardships of child-
making have been much exaggerated.
It is just a matter of doing exercises
in a jolly, communal spirit, and get-
ting into the right optimistic frame
of mind, and the gravid lady will posi-
tively enjoy the production of her tot.
Or so the doctrine goes.
I am inclined to scepticism about it.
Though I have never had a baby my-
self, I know one or two people who
have. They tell me that even with the
benefit of modern pre-natal gymnastics
and conditioning it is no picnic.
Nevertheless I have tried to remain
open-minded and to allow that the
cheery obstetricians of the Delightful
Labor Party might have a point.
It was in this spirit that I approached
a new paperback about pregnancy en-
titled “Nine Happy Months,” by Betty
Patterson (Hodder Books, Australia).
Before reading it I showed it to my
wife, who has been round the mater-
nity course four times. Her reaction
was somewhat discouraging. On see-
ing the title she gave a hoot of
laughter.
Despite this demonstration I was
determined to find out what, accord-
ing to Betty Patterson, made those
nine months so happy. Her book, I
found, was packed with information,

some of it intriguing. For example:
“Years ago, some people believed that
a woman with only one ovary could
produce children of only one sex. This,
of course, was not correct.” Even if
not correct, the belief was an enter-
prising guess.
During the first month, Betty Pat-
terson hinted that things were not
entirely joyous. “Some degree of
nausea may be present,” she conceded.
It would be more accurate, surely, to
say that a marked degree of nausea will
very probably be present, and for more
than one month. Morning sickness, or
“morno” as it is colloquially termed,
did not get its reputation for nothing.
But to give preg-pundit Patterson
her due, she did not stint the
symptoms as the happy months rolled
by. She admitted that in Month 2
the mother-to-be might suffer back-
ache. In Month 3 her clothes began
to feel tight and there was a possibility
of miscarriage. In Month 4 “the glow
of pregnancy can be seen,” but unfor-
tunately “dizziness may occur.” And
so on.
In Month 6 the expectant one’s
felicity was exposed to the hazards of
swollen feet and legs, insomnia, cramps,
heartburn, haemorrhoids, and varicose
veins. If she felt worse than usual,
there was a possibility of toxaemia.
During Month 7, “breathing will be-
come more rapid,” and there were
various inconveniences due to increas-
ing bulk. B. Patterson noted that in
the later months “most women seem
to have a typical walk or gait.” I
have heard this gait described with
more candor by the ladies themselves
as a waddle.
When it came to the showdown of
parturition, Betty Patterson was no
extremist of the anti-anaesthetic Read
camp. She declared truthfully, albeit
grudgingly: “It would be wrong to
say that the birth of the child will be
accomplished without some pain and
discomfort.” Which ranks as the medi-
cal understatement of the week.
This author seems to be in two
minds. She has gone along with the
modern myth that pregnancy is the
life of Riley; but she is too honest and
informed to deny its true character. A
woman who went through the ex-
periences described in “Nine Happy
Months” could only be happy if she
had definite masochistic tendencies.
No doubt the old wives went too
far in their maternity horror-tales. But
the merry-and-bright school of gynae-
cology has erred in the opposite direc-
tion. It makes the pregnant person who
is not glowingly happy suspect that
she is eccentric and subnormal
whereas, in fact, she is anything but.
Also, it devalues the ordeal which these
uncomfortable ladies go through in
order to keep the species afloat. If
one said to a returned soldier: “You
must have been so happy in Viet-
nam,” he might well resent it. One
should be equally cautious, I think,
about suggesting to someone in a cer-
tain condition that she is having a
wonderful time.


BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
What is hatching
at the sign of
the golden cockerel
POOR BATMAN USED to be persona
non grata at the Carlton Brewery. He
had written something which the late
Sir Reginald Fogarty did not admire.
The word was circulated throughout
the building. So when Batman made
his ring-around, secretaries would ans-
wer, “I am sorry, Mr. Blank is not
available.” However, when he rang Sir
Reginald there were no such niceties.
And that’s how it was up at CUB.
The policy was “The best publicity is
no publicity,” and features about Sir
Reginald or the business were rare,
except on the finance pages. They em-
ployed an anti-Public Relations officer.
He was known around town as “Mr.
No Comment.” You could get a no-
comment on almost any phase of the
industry you wished.
It was last June that the big chance
came. It was soon after the appoint-
ment of the new general manager,
Brian Breheny, and we were all in-
vited to CUB for lunch. Your corres-
pondent went there in awe. There are
two immense Melburnian symbols and
they are at either end of Swanston
Street —one is the Shrine and the other
is the Carlton United Brewery.
In recent years the head office of
the empire has been softened with
pretty window boxes, but even so it
has the authoritarian look of another
era. The building is made of big blocks
of blue stone. Well, we went in. There
was a nice man waiting to wave us
upstairs to the reception-room. There
was a long table loaded with chicken,
turkey, caviar, sucking pig, ham,
Camembert . . .
The occasion was the launching of
the new rip-top can and Mr. Breheny
made a very nice speech. He said there
was a new attitude at the brewery and
they wanted to co-operate with the
Press in every way.
He said newspapermen could call
him direct, any time of the day or night.
He was always available. All he asked
was that they be reasonably well-
informed about the industry. The
other day a lady reporter had tele-
phoned him and she hadn’t even
known where the brewery was.
One reporter thereupon went away
and spelt his name wrongly in two
places, but it was a good start. And,
honestly, relations have been splendid
ever since. Earlier this month there
was another marvellous lunch, the
opening of the $650,000 “Southern
Aurora Hotel” at Dandenong. Mr.
Breheny did the opening and every-
one went up by train. Then, a fort-
night ago, Mr. Breheny took the ball-
room at the Southern Cross Hotel to
launch CUB stubbies in Victoria.
On this occasion he invited all Press,
radio, TV, licensed grocers, restaur-
ateurs, and club men. Once again
there was turkey, ham, chicken, suck-
ing pig, caviar, Camembert . . . Mr.
Breheny showed us his stubbies and
the “handypack” packet of six bottles
with the newly designed foil label.
At the brewery party we all went home
with a box of six rip-top cans. At
this party it was a handypack.
The cynics say God Bless Courage
for the new era, but this would have
come about anyway. Brian Breheny is
a genuinely progressive and charming
man and he wants to get the old
Bastille at the top of Swanston Street
out of the Victorian era.
Let’s have a look at our opposing
beer barons. Sir Maurice Nathan,
chairman of the Australian Courage
Company, is chairman and managing
director of Paterson’s the furniture
people. He is a former Lord Mayor
of Melbourne, a very determined
gentleman, the leading battler for the
Melbourne World Fair and an ex-
Geelong Grammar boy.
Brian Breheny is 55, grey-haired,
with a fine moustache, a lover of the
horses, with plenty of charm. He lives
several doors away from Harold Holt
in St. George’s Road and he is an
ex-Xavier boy.
The Courage people have been
building their $ll million brewery out
at Broadmeadows with the aim of
starting production in mid-1968.
Courage has been taking things very
quietly, letting CUB make all the play
with their rip-top cans and their stub-
“Phew! I hope the breweries
call a ceasefire over Christmas.”
bies. It was time to call on Sir
Maurice to see what was happening.
He said this was deliberate: “You
don’t want to start your publicity too
early. We have some ideas. When we
get going they won’t know what hit
them.”
What about accusations that Courage
beer will be too similar to what Mel-
bourne is already getting?
“That’s all right. When people are
used to getting Yardleys you don’t just
suddenly hit them with Chanel No. 5.”
You said you wanted 10 percent of
the market?
“We’ll do better than that. Look,
don’t mistake me. We won’t hurt CUB.
Beer is a good, wholesome drink. We’re
going to get more people interested in
it with new methods and ideas. We’ll
just expand the market. People here
think that Carlton beer is the world’s
best. It’s not, you know.”
Have you had many people offering
you advice?
“The letters have come by the thou-
sand. I’ve just been answering one from
Hong Kong. Some people want us to
make heavier beer, others lighter beer,
and theie are all the people nostalgic
for home who want us to make a gen-
uine flat English beer.”
And will you? “No.” Any other
letters?
“Oh, yes, everybody looks to Courage
as a fairy godmother. Lots of people
who want to build a motel on some
God-forsaken corner feel that Courage
will just come along and build it for
them. We’re not interested in property,
we just want to make beer and sell it.
We’ll be happy to see two-tap hotels
offering a choice of Carlton or
Courage.”
And Sir Maurice told how special
test brews for the Melbourne Cour-
age market had been made, using
precisely the composition of our water.
It had come back in kegs, bottles, and
cans. They had undertaken special tas-
tings at clubs and hotels all around
Melbourne. This was done with great
care, using masked bottles, and asking
people to give points for color, taste,
effervescence, etc.
“Amazing,” said Sir Maurice,
“Everybody thinks he’s the world’s
greatest beer expert. I remember one
fellow who came away and said ‘l’ve
just tasted the Courage beer. One was
bloody awful, the other was quite
good.’ Both beers he had tasted were
Fosters Lager.”
The symbol for Courage will be the
traditional golden cockerel and they
don’t plan to hit all Victoria in one
mighty burst. As the brewery comes
into production they will start off in
test areas at maybe three or more
suburbs at a time.
One suggested that it required a
little courage to take on CUB, this
mighty firm that had just declared a
profit of $7 million. But Sir Maurice
looked unworried. “There have been
suggestions that they might take us over.
Do you realise we have Bx-itish Tobacco
behind us. We’re bigger than CUB.
We might take them over.”

Hi
Head of a man Vincent Van Gogh, 1853-1890. Dutch School. Donated by the Felton Bequest, 1939.
Before too long, Australia's one and only Van
Gogh will be hanging in the new gallery of
the Victorian Arts Centre now being built in
Melbourne. You'll enjoy going there it will
be a very pleasant place to look at pictures.
And Alcoa aluminium in a new kind of roof
will help make it that way. It will play an
important part in the control of interior
temperatures—keeping things bright and
dry and cool.
The designer of the Victorian Arts Centre has
taken advantage of the characteristics of
Alcoa aluminium particularly its superior
bright finish in a patented process of sun
control. Bright Alcoa aluminium sheeting is
pierced in a pattern of small slits, and the
sheet expanded in such a way that the slits
form three-dimensional apertures. The expan-
ded sheet is vacuum-sealed between two
panels of acrylic, and the panels are formed
into a series of curved rooflights. This forms a
screen of tiny apertures which admit desirable
light, reflect intense beams of direct sunlight
and keep out rain. Very ingenious. And the
light which filters through the screen is evenly,
pleasingly diffused throughout the building.
Yes, Alcoa aluminium will help present Aus-
tralia's only Van Gogh and all the art
treasures from the previous home of the
National Gallery of Victoria in the best
possible light.

like this kitchenware, made out of
Hostalen
The quality of the plastics products you can buy is quickly
improving because of the raw material Hostalen.
Take these kitchen plastics. Because they are made out of
Hostalen they are rigid and strong, yet won’t break or
crack if you drop them. When you fill them with boiling
water or heavy loads, they won’t bulge out of shape.
They are hygienic and extremely easy to clean. They are
colorful, beautiful, modern in design. Hostalen high
density polyethylene is the top quality plastics raw
material developed in Germany and now produced in
Australia.
Manufacturers who use Hostalen make top quality
plastics products. The shop that sells them is changing its
ideas about plastics products and wants to give you the
very best.
You deserve better things made out of plastics, so it’s
really worth asking for the ones made from Hostalen.

Honesty is not enough
for stockbrokers
COMMENT
BY
MICHAEL
BAUME
THE MORE “LITTLE PEOPLE”
who get caught up by the lure of the
share market as the mining post booms
along the more important it is that the
stock exchanges recognise their respon-
sibilities to investors. The professional
investors should be able to fend for
themselves; “people’s capitalism” means
that people who are not equipped to do
so must be protected if the system is
to survive.
For stockbrokers do have serious re-
sponsibilities, the basic nature of which
has been dramatised by two serious
breaches of them, which have resulted
in brokers being suspended. But there
is no doubt at all that many other
brokers have at times taken a much
looser view of their responsibilities than
that required of the profession by Mr.
Justice Street in his judgment last week
In a suspended broker’s unsuccessful
action against the Sydney Stock Ex-
change. It is all very well saying that
people who come into the market are
“at risk”; so they are. But one of the
risks they face should not be the pos-
sibility that the broker through whom
they do their business may be trading
against them; that their best interests
In the market are coming a bad second
to his.
“A fundamental principle of com-
mercial morality will be gravely
compromised if brokers are permitted
to enter the market and to trade not for
their clients but in competition with
them,” said the judge when sharply re-
minding brokers that the law prevented
them from acting as principal and as
agent at the same time; that they could
not accept brokerage if they were meet-
ing a client’s order by selling him their
own shares. But it is striking that not
only did the judge insist that “A broker
Is precluded by the very nature of his
position in the community from playing
the market,” he also stated quite
clearly that a broker’s job is far more
than simply being an “agent” acting for
a client. He said: “The primary func-
tion of a sharebroker is to advise clients
and to act on their behalf in the pur-
chase and sale of shares. He occupies
a position which imposes on him im-
portant obligations toward his client.”
This is important. There are some
brokers who do not regard their ad-
visory functions as a real part of their
job at all, and who stress that these
are services supplied, in varying
amounts by different brokers, not out of
any sense of responsibility to clients but
simply to help business. The only curb
they see on bad advice is that it may
lose them clients. (In this situation a
broker has to decide not between right
and wrong but simply whether the
benefit he will get from giving bad
advice will outweigh the likely loss of
clients.)
And there are many brokers who
seem to take the view that there is
nothing wrong with trading heavily on
the market for themselves (there are
a few brokers who seem to spend more
time and energy doing this than catering
for clients). It was this that prompted
the judge to say: “I think it necessary
in view of the apparent widespread
practice of stockbrokers acting as share
traders to make clear the limitations
imposed upon the freedom of brokers
to deal in shares.” Not that the judge
was prohibiting brokers absolutely
from buying and selling shares on their
own behalf, and his objections to their
“playing the market” seemed to be
only of degree: “Once the degree is
reached where a broker’s private trans-
actions become of frequent occurrence
or constitute a significant part of the
purchases and sales negotiated by him,
then he is exceeding the limit placed on
him by principles of commercial
morality . . . Brokers who seek to
enrich themselves by trading with the
public thereby discredit themselves
and their calling.”
When the question of right and
wrong is one of “degree” rather than
a clearly visible line, then the courts
and the stock exchanges themselves
are going to find it difficult to take
strong stands on the matter. But there
is no question of degree in the matter
of brokers dealing as unrevealed
principals with their clients, which is
illegal. And the broking industry says
there is no conflict between what it
does and what the judge said. For
brokers insist that they do not trade
against their clients and that when they
sell stock as principals to their clients
they do disclose their position.
Investors must be given a fair deal
by brokers. Yet the stock exchanges
must also avoid the dangers of going
.to the other extreme of excessive
paternalism. It was absurd, for in-
stance, for most Australian stock
exchanges (with the notable exception
of Melbourne) to deprive investors of
a market place on Monday last week,
before Australia had decided whether
to devalue or not. If investors are silly
enough to gamble on gold stocks and
so on, why not let them? It simply
means that brokers, in their court-
stressed role of advisers, would simply
be obliged to warn investors of the
risks they were taking by trading on
such a day.
The public simply wants a properly,
organised market place where agents
are not competing with investors and
where brokers are giving honest advice.
It is not too much to ask for.

Those easy days are
over for Mr. Holt
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
BOTH HIS tepid Senate campaign and
his mishandling of the VIP aircraft
affair showed that Mr. Holt does not
yet know how to handle the new kind
of political situation not only the
opposition of Mr. Whitlam but also
the criticism of a Senate that can
become a watchdog when the DLP
wants it to.
When Holt first came into office he
got it very easy. Mr. Calwell was busy
hacking away at the Labor Party’s
throat by putting up antediluvian
policies that were an affront to tradi-
tions deeply held among the Australian
people. All Holt had to do was tc help
Calwell drive the knife deeper.
In the recent Senate campaign he
seemed to think that the main thing
he had to do was again to attack
Labor’s leader the old recipe. But
it isn’t going to be as easy as that any
more.
Whitlam is the first Labor leader
since Ben Chifley who has that sense
of endless manipulation that is essential
within the Labor Party. He is an “Art-
ful Dodger,” but to some extent this
is what Labor leaders always have to
be. His attempts to steer the Labor
Party back into looking like a legitimate
claimant to office may fail, but they
make Whitlam a much more difficult
opponent than his predecessor, who at
the end of his career was following the
impossible luxury for a politician of
merely indulging in his enthusiasms.
There is a difference between a leader
who runs to the Left and a leader who
is trying to use his own guile and the
beguilements of office to move his party
to the Right.
To attack Whitlam as if he is Calwell
is to argue from the unbelievable. It
can blow back in the Government’s
face. It can also seem to some voters to
be sour grapes. At his best (when he
isn’t playing the fool as an under-
graduate debater) Whitlam can be a
more impressive speaker than Holt. The
greater preparation he puts into his
speeches and his livelier use of words
project him as having more overall
intellectual substance; he can sound as
if he is speaking from a general,
thought-out position, not merely making
it all up as he goes along.
The most honest course for the
Liberals may also be the most expedient
to stop acting as if the nature of
Whitlam were vital and to concentrate
their attack on the Labor Party itself.
The quickest way to assault Whitlam’s
credibility effectively may be what at
first sight seems the long way round,
but in any type of propaganda it is the
believable that matters, and this is not
always revealed by frontal attack. The
Government’s line should be something
like this: The Labor Party has a
declared policy on Vietnam that runs
counter to the attitudes of a majority
of Australians. There is little doubt that
Whitlam, by and large, shares these
majority Australian attitudes. Where
there is considerable doubt is whether
his Parliamentary Party would go along
with him if, as Prime Minister, he tried
to wriggle out of his Party’s instruc-
tions. He might. He might not. Why
take the risk?
The second course the Liberals
should follow and again it is not
only an honorable course but also an
expedient one is to become a better
Government. They are misreading the
Senate voting figures if they read them
as an indication that, although there
was a swing against them, they would
get in again next time. How they go
next time depends on how they behave
in the meantime. If they muck things
up between now and the next election
they could lose it, Vietnam or not.
The 1961 election was almost lost
by Sir Robert Menzies because the Gov-
ernment looked as if it was messing
around with economic policy and didn’t
really know what to do. Those who
abhorred what was then Labor’s foreign
policy voted against Labor by voting
for the Government, either directly or
via the DLP. But tens of thousands of
others who were not so interested in
foreign policy, or not interested in it at
all, simply switched from Liberal to
Labor. If Whitlam had been leading
the Labor Party in 1961 instead of
Calwell he would have won the election.
It is quite likely that new impulses
are moving in Australian society,
especially among the young,' and that
these include a desire for a greater
display of the use of intelligence in
human affairs, a sense of. contemporary
style. The dislike of President Johnson’s
Vietnam policy in America is partly
the distrust of Johnson’s old-hat style;
President Kennedy would have followed
much the same policies as Johnson in
Vietnam, but he would have got more
support for them, because he could
have better appealed to the contem-
porary American imagination. He
would have looked as if he knew what
he was doing.
But this contemporary style is not
just a gimmick. It does not mean that
a prime minister has to look like Bill
Peach and talk like a cigarette com-
mercial. Whether Mr. Holt smiles or
not doesn’t really matter. It’s what
comes out of his mouth that matters,
what seems to be going on inside his
head. What is going on inside Mr.
Holt’s head, and the heads of his
senior Ministers? They should learn
how to tell us. Or get some new heads.
Has the DLP finally
come to stay?
COMMENT
BY
ALAN
REID
THE FUNDAMENTAL THAT seems
to emerge from last Saturday’s Senate
poll is that whichever party the Demo-
cratic Labor Party backs will win.
Neither of the major political group-
ings can draw much comfort from the
vote. The Government went signifi-
cantly backwards, well below its peak
of 1966. While to slip from that peak is
not necessarily bad, to slip at the rate it
slipped and in the time it slipped was
rather ominous. Without the DLP,
Labor would have won N.S.W., Vic-
toria, and Queensland, the three States
which, for all practical purposes, decide
the political complexion of the govern-
ment of Australia. Only in N.S.W. did
the Labor Party go close to securing
the 50 percent of the vote that would
give it the hope of securing a govern-
ment in its own right. While the DLP
preferred the Government to the Labor
Party its chances of securing office con-
tinued to be remote.
There are headaches for the leaders
of both major political groupings in
this situation. Hitherto the Holt Gov-
ernment has been able to view the DLP
tolerantly as a splinter group and as
a scourge for the ALP. But after last
Saturday it emerges very clearly as a
power in its own right. It was quite an
extraordinary achievement for it to get
its own quota in Victoria without the
assistance of preferences from any
other political group. There has been
a tendency among both Government
and Labor groups to regard the DLP
as something that would disappear from
the Australian political scene either by
erosion or through re-absorption into
the body of the ALP. But the possi-
bility now is that it is here to stay.
The DLP now has four Parliamen-
tary representatives Senator Gair,
the leader, and Senator McManus and
the new Senators in the shape of Con
Byrne, from Queensland, and J. A.
Little, from Victoria. I do not know
much about Little. But both Gair and
McManus are very able operators. Even
their most bitter opponents in the
Labor Party would admit that they
know how to extract the maximum

advantage from any situation. Byrne
has been in the Senate before, rep-
resenting the ALP back in the halcyon
pre-split days. He also is very able,
personable, persuasive, and liked even
by his nominal enemies within the ALP.
The DLP has now doubled the numbers
of its performers on the platform pro-
vided by Parliament, and those per-
formers occupy a very key position.
They virtually control the Senate. If
they exercise their control responsibly,
they can attract further voters to the
DLP. This will undoubtedly be their
aim.
For Holt the great fear must be lest
they settle their differences with the
Labor Party and return to their one-
time allegiance (all four are former
members of the ALP). If that hap-
pened, he and his administration could
be in real trouble.
At this stage I do not believe that
this is likely. Undoubtedly, any attempt
to get a reconciliation between the
ALP and the DLP would produce a
new ALP split. The DLP is completely
in conflict with the Left Wing of the
Labor Party on defence and foreign
policy. Just as the DLP will not have
a bar of present ALP policy on defence
and foreign affairs, the Left Wing of
the Labor Party will not have a bar
of the DLP policy on defence and
foreign affairs. They are irreconcilable.
This means that the body of the
Labor leadership that hungers for office
has a problem. No sooner had the votes
gone on the board on Saturday night
than tentative negotiations opened be-
tween ALP elements which have not
the same implacable hatred of the
DLP as Left-wing Labor and DLP
men who are willing to listen to
propositions, even though they know r
that at this stage they are meaningless.
Opposition Leader Gough Whitlam
publicly held out a fragment' of an
olive branch. He expressed the hope
that the DLP would co-operate in
securing the setting up of Senate com-
mittees that would investigate areas in
which Labor has an interest educa-
tion, national disasters, and the like.
But to secure a reconciliation it is clear
that the ALP has to go much further
than merely being publicly polite. It
has to get an electoral working ar-
rangement.
Undoubtedly, flushed with success,
the DLP would insist that such a work-
ing arrangement be on its terms. This
would immediately bring in questions
of defence and foreign affairs with
the certainty of violent reaction from
Labor’s Left Wing. The question that
the ALP leadership (anxious for
office) would have to face up to is
whether to take the risk of a further
ALP split or just allow things to drift
in the hope that something will turn
up to destroy the DLP’s present posi-
tion as the balance of political • power.
For both Holt and Whitlam, last
Saturday’s vote created problems and
the DLP is at the heart of them. How
will they handle these problems as the
DLP continues to function as the pace-
setter in the Senate?


AUSTRALIA
Now Holt has to think
of all his tomorrows
From ALAN REID
FOR PRIME MINISTER Harold Holt,
tired, depressed with the Senate vote,
suddenly jolted from his comfortable
philosophy that politics consists of ups
and downs into realisation that a
political course can lead constantly
downwards, the weeks immediately
ahead represent pressure.
From within his own Party the
pressures are for a rebuilding rather
than a patching. An increasing number
of Government supporters are begin-
ning to recognise that the real weak-
nesses within Cabinet are political
rather than administrative. There are
weaknesses in administration, of course.
The fact that Air Minister Peter How-
son and, because of Howson, Holt
could continue for months-in ignorance
of the existence of documents which
listed, admittedly imperfectly, the
names of passengers carried on VIP
aircraft while all the time the docu-
ments were not only in existence but
known to exist by quite a number of
people is an example of an administra-
tive weakness. There are other nearly as
clearcut examples, ranging over a wide
variety of subjects. But far more im-
portant than the administrative short-
comings are the political shortcomings.
The Government seems to operate on a
day-to-day basis, without much thought
•of tomorrow, and while this was good
enough while Labor assured it of con-
tinuance in office by virtue of Labor’s
continual and abysmal gift for making
mistakes, that position no longer obtains.
It is against this background that
Holt has to do his thinking. Whether he
has the ruthlessness to take the Minis-
terial action that will give his Govern-
ment the much needed new look that
could put an end to its downward
movement remains to be seen. So far,
though capable of making firm and
courageous policy and administrative
•decisions, Holt has not shown the same
force when dealing with personalities.
But there are those in his party who
are urging him to grasp firmly the
nettle of .his Government’s declining
authority and to confront the electorate
with a brisker, fresher Ministry that
would ensure that the Government
retained power in its own right and not
merely because of the crass errors of
the Labor Party, which are unlikely to
be made with the same gusto under
the new leadership of Gough Whitlam,
a far more ambiguous operator, as they
were when the aging, didactic Arthur
Calwell was at the Labor helm. As
interesting a suggestion as any is that
the External Affairs portfolio now held
by Mr. Paul Hasluck in the House of
Representatives be transferred to Sen-
ator John Gorton and the Senate.
Transfer of the External Affairs port-
folio from Hasluck and the Representa-
tives to Gorton and the Senate would
undoubtedly hold advantages for the
Government. On the Vietnam issue,
on which the Government and Labor
are in basic disagreement, the DLP’s
views are even stronger and more
opposed to Labor’s than the Govern-
ment’s. Whatever views may be held
about the political convictions of the
four DLP Senators Vince Gair, of
Queensland, Frank McManus, of Vic-
toria, and the two new men, Con Byrne,
of Queensland, and John Little, of Vic-
toria, who will be formally named as
Senators-elect when Senate counting is
completed toward the end of this
week - they are formidable and effec-
tive parliamentary opponents. Even
their enemies admit their capacity,
though they condemn the manner in
which it is used. With this team the
Government would start off with con-
siderable strength in any Senate ex-
ternal-affairs debate, and Gorton him-
self is no mean performer.
Having the External Affairs portfolio
in the Senate would give the Govern-
ment the double advantage that the
replies to the foreign-affairs policy
declarations of the Government and
DLP would come not from Whitlam
but from Labor’s spokesmen in the
"But man, the likes of us compelled to number squares"
Senate. The Senate Labor Leader, Sen-
ator Lionel Murphy, and his deputy,
Senator Cohen, are far less ambiguous
than Whitlam about their support for
Labor’s policy of withdrawal from Viet-
nam. Murphy participated in the dem-
onstrations organised by Calwell against
Air Vice-Marshal Ky when he visited
Australia; Whitlam discreetly retired to
a Queensland holiday resort. Cohen is
against the Vietnamese conflict and
Australia’s participation in it in its
present form.
It would undoubtedly be to the Gov-
ernment’s advantage to have the Ex-
ternal Affairs portfolio in the Senate,
where the Government-Labor divisions
on foreign policy would show up in a
more clearcut fashion. But whether
Holt would come at it or not remains
to be seen. Such a move would present
him with consequential problems. He
would have to find a niche for Hasluck.
He might find this in the Defence port-
folio. Possibly Hasluck’s careful, pre-
cise, and thorough style is what the
Defence Department needs at this point
of history. If he shifted Hasluck to
Defence he would then have to find a
place for the present Defence Minister,
Allen Fairhall. But Holt has no surplus
of ability at his disposal. Though
narrow in some respects, Fairhall has
enormous capacity within his limita-
tions. He has gingered up every port-
folio he has had.
The permutations and combinations
are numerous. One section of the Lib-
eral Party would like Holt to put to
more effective use the immense energy
and imaginative approach of back-
bencher William Wentworth, N.S.W.,
who receives innumerable public com-
pliments for the stimulating originality
of his thought from his Labor oppon-
ents* who regard him as simultaneously
the best and worst mind in the Parlia-
ment. If this colossal energy and imag-
ination could be harnessed and
chanelled into
productive direc-
tions the value to
the Government
would be im-
mense. Holt
might not be pre-
pared to take
risks and Went-
worth’s unpredic-
tability is un-
doubtedly a risk,
But Holt is
moving into a<
position where He
has to take risks.
If he does not,
the dow nwa r d
movement of his
Government
could continue.


DEVALUATION:
THE COWMEN GET IT TWO WAYS
THE ADVERSE EFFECTS of devalua-
tion fall most heavily on . . . yes, the
poor dairyfarmers and, to a lesser
Extent, the fruitgrowers.
v .
Uur cow men are going to get it two
r™ , r I-,
ways. They are being subjected to a
nasty crossfire from two economic dnec-
tions. For one thing, Britain is the
only worthwhile market in the world
for butter. Last year almost 80 per-
cent of the butter traded internationally
was consumed by Britons, so when
Britons pull in their belts, world butter
sales go to pot.
Secondly, all the principal suppliers
of butter to Britain except ourselves
have devalued. Ireland has, Denmark
has, and, of course, New Zealand went
right past Britain. All those countries
have given themselves a good solid
cost advantage over us and will there-
fore be able to undercut us.
The Dairy Board, like the Wheat
Board, faces a straight capital loss on
the butter it has in stock in Britain
or already consigned and on the sea:
a cold 24,000 tons, or $15,000,000
worth. But the loss on this pales into
insignificance against the permanent
losses in the British market, which
takes one-third of our butter production.
There is no one in the Australian
Government who takes seriously the
British pledges to look after British
Commonwealth interests when they get
, . . ; f,
around to negotiations to enter the
£jt C _
But this is only half the problem.
For Australian dairymen had been try-
j n g t 0 build U p exports of various pro-
ducts like milk powder in the Pacific
area and South-East Asia to offset some
D f the British marketing problems that
were due to intensify once Britain got
Into the Common Market. The 20 per-
cent New Zealand devaluation will give
it a strong competitive edge in this
market, which already had become very
significant and whose loss would be a
double disaster. For Britain’s $45
million worth of imports of Australian
dairy products is far exceeded by the
$6O million-odd worth sold to other
sterling area countries (mainly nearby)
along with Japan (which alone takes
sl6| million and is a natural market for
New Zealand) and other countries in
the region.
So the talk in Canberra, in Primary
Industry, the Trade Department,
offices of the Country Party, and
Ministers too (not just in Treasury),
is that we now have to face up to the
inescapable task of reducing dairy pro-
duction. Perhaps 10,000 dairyfarmers
will have to switch to other occupa-
tions. A little can be done by more
vigorous promotion of the subsidiary
dairy products, cheese, casein, ice-
cream powders, and the like. But there
is no escape from a drive to reduce
production, to ensure that an unman-
ageable surplus does not build up.
The fruit men are hard hit, too. The
British market is about half the world
market for a variety of dried and canned
and fresh and so any diminution
of British buying power will affect the
world price decisively. Furthermore,
with important suppliers like Spain and
Israel having devalued, as with butter
our fellows will be up against fiercer
competition.
What can these producers do instead
if they lose their markets?
Dairymen could at least switch their
properties to meat fattening, although
the economics of this industry would
demand much greater units than now
exist in dairying. So a gradual Govern-
ment-encouraged selling-up and moving-
off seems the only answer for many
dairymen. But there is little else to-
which the dried-fruits growers can
switch their operations; the trees and
vines are not usable for anything else.
FOR MOST, SETBACKS WILL BE MILD
“WHEN THE FILES start getting on
the floor, you know there is a bit of a
panic on,” said a man in a Canberra
department last week. He was negoti-
ating a path through to his glass en-
closure past the desks and between the
files which indeed were on the floor.
For the Government had asked for
comprehensive submissions on indus-
tries affected by the British devaluation,
-and Commonwealth departments had to
compile their cases quickly.
The general lines of the submissions
are clear: a large number of industries,
primary and secondary, will suffer set-
backs, but for most these will be quite
mild. The prices of our major com-
modities are set by world market fac-
tors, supply and demand fixing a level.
Thus, while dairy products and butter
will be hit, commodities like wool,
wheat, and meat and sugar will not be
hit very hard. The sterling price of
each will rise to just about compensate
for the devaluation. Sugar, for instance,
which before devaluation was selling on
the open market in London for £2l
sterling is now selling for £25 sterling.
But not only has the world sugar
price rise almost offset the devaluation,
the sugar industry will suffer no losses
on existing contracts (for the 1967
season), even though they are in ster-
ling. For Colonial Sugar Refining, as
the selling agent, had protected Aus-
tralian currency returns by forward
contracts at the old rate of exchange.
And these will apply to British pur-
chases under the British Common-
wealth Sugar Agreement next year, too,
which will make up about 20 percent
of sugar exports in the current season.
So the higher price that British con-
sumers will have to pay for sugar will
only affect a small part of our exports
(possibly 15 percent) that go to Britain
over the agreed quota. Nevertheless, the
sugar industry could feel some effects
in a year’s time, when the British Com-
monwealth Sugar Agreement comes up
for renegotiation.
Now that Britain takes less than 20
percent of Australia’s meat exports,
instead of being our major market a
decade ago, sterling devaluation should
no t have any great impact, although it
will clearly reduce Australian meat-
company earnings in Britain one way
or another. For if sterling meat prices
move up to offset the devaluation, then
British consumers will buy less, and if
sterling prices remain steady, then ex-
porters will earn less in dollars. Fortun-
ately, Argentina, the biggest beef sup-
plier, did not devalue. In lamb, New
Zealand’s devaluation makes the Lon-
don market more attractive to its pro-
ducers, but lamb makes up less than
eight percent of our British exports.
Altogether then, Australia’s food
exports to Britain, which make up
about half our total sales there, are
likely to suffer in varying amounts
either from a reduction in British
demand for price reasons or from other
countries now having better access to
the British market. And the same
goes for other primary and semi-
processed products.
The wool industry’s main problem
with devaluation was simply that Aus-
tralia did not follow Britain’s lead. For
the industry is in basic trouble and
had hoped that a devaluation of the
Australian dollar would have restored
wool earnings to a more realistic level
in sales to big customers like the Jap-
anese even if wool prices remained the
same in foreign currency terms. It looks
as if something will have to be done
for this industry as the combination of
steadily rising costs and steadily falling
prices under pressure of competition
from synthetics is having a serious
squeeze on graziers.
However, Britain’s devaluation could
bring a few advantages to wool. For
it will mean that Britain’s wool textile
industry should be able to reduce its
export prices in the big markets of


THE WASH-UP
FAITH COST
$30 MILLION
THROUGH A BLUNDER, the Aus-
tralian Government’s faith in sterling
will cost the wheat industry $3O million
in one hit.
But this big loss, a once-and-for-all
affair, will almost certainly be met by
the Government rather than the wheat
industry, because about a year ago the
Wheat Board went to the Government
with a proposal for insuring against
devaluation. The Government, through
the Reserve Bank, vetoed the proposal
on the grounds that the Wheat Board
was a Government authority and any
such insurance policy would be taken
as an official statement of non-faith in
sterling.
The Chinese, who took a third of
our wheat exports last year, have
always insisted on negotiating contracts
with Australia in sterling. In our latest
wheat deal with China, in which we
undertook to supply million tons,
worth about $9O million (before de-
valuation), shipments have been
spread from July to December, so
there is still a large amount of wheat
we are obliged to ship to China under
Europe and North America and may
be able to win back some of these
markets not only from other woollen
textiles like Japan but also from some
of the high-quality synthetics with
which wool competes. Nevertheless,
the British domestic market for woollen
goods will certainly be harder for a
couple of years because of the higher
sterling price of wool, and this could
offset much of any possible demand
rise by British woollen-goods exporters.
Apart from wool, the only Australian
raw materials sold to Britain in any
quantity that could benefit from an
expansion in British exports of finished
goods are metals, particularly lead and
zinc. About 45 percent of Australia’s
lead exports go to Britain along with
30 percent of our zinc. But these, like
wool, are responsive to world market
prices, and benefits could be offset by
lower domestic demand in Britain, par-
ticularly as any increase in British
manufactured exports could be at the
expense of another user of lead and
zinc and therefore be of no real benefit
to producers like Australia.
Only about five percent of Australian
exports to Britain are of finished manu-
factured goods, like sporting goods,
photographic equipment, motor
vehicles, and agricultural equipment,
and these will be clearly hit. But for
most exporters they are only a small
proportion of their total output.
McEwen ... Kennedy Round gains
this contract for 14.3 percent less in
our dollars. And there are still large
debts owing to us from previous ship-
ments to China on credit. Altogether,
the Chinese are committed to paying
us another £stgBo million for wheat
already delivered and soon to be de-
livered. Last week this was worth $2OO
million; now it is worth $l7O million.
The long-term position of the wheat
industry is not, of course, threatened by
the British devaluation since no wheat-
producing countries have gone with
Britain in devaluing (which would have
given them a competitive advantage
over the others) and since the world
price of wheat is not importantly
affected by British demand (China and
India and Japan are bigger buyers, and
the Europeans, despite rising protec-
tion, still consume a lot).
Last year Britain bought only about
six percent of Australia’s total wheat
exports, a remarkable change from her
dominant position of 20 years ago. So
devaluation of sterling (and even the
prospect of Britain getting into the
EEC) is of much less long-term
significance than last May’s Kennedy
Round agreement on wheat prices
which Trade Minister McEwen claims
could increase Australia’s wheat ex-
ports by as much as $4O millibn a
year.
NOT MUCH TROUBLE FOR INDUSTRY
THE IMPACT devaluation will have
on Australian imports of British goods
will depend on what policy British ex-
porters decide to follow. Many will
leave their Australian selling prices
up where they were before the devalu-
ation and simply get the extra income
in sterling these bring. This is especially
so for products for which demand is
unlikely to rise much if prices did fall
14.3 percent, like Rolls-Royce motor-
cars and scotch whisky.
Others will leave their sterling export
prices where they were, so reducing the
cost of their products to Australian
buyers, and try to increase their export
earnings by selling a lot more. So
secondary industry will be affected in
diverse ways — as diverse as the
Chamber of Manufacturers’ initial
statement on the devaluation. A whole
range of industries will be able to get
equipment and raw materials more
cheaply. For instance, the manufac-
turers of nylon and terylene fibres will
get their polymer raw material more
cheaply. Polymer is the big cost for
this industry, so there should be an
opportunity for a reduction in the
massive tariff protection it is given, or
at least a reduction in the selling price.
Manufacturers of machinery import
many of their components from
Britain, so firms like Chrysler should be
in a better cost position.
Other firms will face slightly stiffer
import competition since finished
British products will be capable of being
sold more cheaply. In some cases both
influences will operate in offsetting
directions. Of course, to the extent that
British costs themselves rise, through
raw material costs rising, or trade
unions breaking through the wage
freeze, or shipping freights rising (in
sterling terms), the influence of the
devaluation will be mitigated. And the
U.K. Government has withdrawn the
tax incentives to export, so adding to
export costs.
But these days the cutting edge of
the Australian tariff operates mainly
against Japanese, European, and Ameri-
can competition. The British still have
some tariff advantages, although only a
few months ago at the Kennedy Round
talks, the Government sold off British
preferential tariffs on a wide range of
industrial products and increased pro-
tection against British imports by from
7.5 to 12.5 percent. So the edge given
by devaluation in some instances will do
little more than offset this. Altogether,
then, there is unlikely to be much
serious trouble for Australian industry
as a result of increased British com-

petitiveness. In fact, in Canberra at
least, any large spate of references by
the Department of Trade to the Tariff
Board will be interpreted not as a reac-
tion to the devaluation but as part of
the larger war on tariff policy. The
Board wants to get on with a broad
review of Australia’s tariff structure, as
it promised in its annual report. But
the Department of Trade, fearing the
results of any such review, is keen to
gum up the Board’s works with a lot of
time-consuming inquiries. It is known
to think that devaluation might provide
a plausible excuse. So things like de-
valuation have bizarre effects in the
most remote places.
HARDER SELLING IN NEW ZEALAND
THERE ARE PLENTY of other impli-
cations for Australia of devaluation
apart from our trade with Britain.
There is the New Zealand problem, the
consequences of the mounting run on
the American dollar (which is pushing
up our gold share prices), the future of
our capital inflow (which is holding up
well), freight rates (going up per-
cent), and all the rest of it.
The main impact of New Zealand’s
devaluation which makes it harder for
Australian manufacturers to sell in their
biggest single market is on the motor
trade. Our main trading link with New
Zealand has been as an exporter there
rather than an importer of its goods as
New Zealand provides only 1.6 percent
of Australia’s imports, and most of that
is in forest products (timber, pulp, and
paper), while it is a market for 6 per-
cent of Australia’s exports.
Motor vehicles are the biggest single
Australian export to New Zealand,
worth more than $2l million a year
and making up about one-eighth of the
total. British-made cars (and those
assembled in New Zealand from British
parts) will now be cheaper and so
could get a fair slice of our market; and
the same goes for all the manufactured
goods that comprise the bulk of our
exports there. But the new liberalising
of New Zealand import restrictions fol-
lowing devaluation could have a few
offsetting benefits for Australian ex-
porters.
The new export incentives that Mr.
McMahon promised last week could
help a bit more. But, in any event, Aus-
tralian exporters had been looking
further afield than New Zealand in
recent times, particularly since its
severe import restrictions had made it
such a hard place to sell in anyway.
Now that New Zealand’s exports to
Australia can be sold up to 20
percent cheaper and still return the
same income in New Zealand, New
Zealand’s forests are likely to earn in-
creasing income in Australia. And it
seems that the big paper war between
Australian Paper Manufacturers and
New Zealand’s Tasman Pulp that
threatened to disrupt sales of New
Zealand’s biggest trans-Tasman export
(and also to cause the breakdown of
the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade
Agreement) is now settled. APM’s
threat to buy its pulp from Canada
instead of from Tasman, if the New
Zealanders sold liner board in Aus-
tralia in competition with APM, will
not be carried out now that Tasman
can supply 20 percent cheaper. And
there are suggestions that Tasman may
prefer simply to expand its pulp sales
in Australia rather than set up in com-
petition with its biggest customer on
the finished product.
But other New Zealand exports will
be able to increase their earnings in
Australia, particularly farm products
like vegetables, strawberries, pigmeats,
and even a bit of cheese. And so could
manufactures like carpets and farm
equipment and even some consumer
durables like refrigerators. It will be
cheaper for Australians to visit New
Zealand, so its revenue from Australian
tourists should rise.
Many Australian companies, like
Felt and Textiles and ACI, have large
New Zealand subsidiaries, and the de-
valuation has meant not only that the
investment in them is now worth 20
percent less, but that these have to
earn profits and dividends 20 percent
higher in New Zealand to do as well
for their Australian parents.

Social welfare
One State acts
SOUTH AUSTRALIA CONTINUED
what its Premier has called “its move-
ment into the 20th century” with a
new scale of public-relief rates
announced last week. The new rates
established a clear lead over those pro-
vided in the rest of Australia.
Premier Dunstan said last week that
the increases announced for widows,
deserted wives, the unemployed, pen-
sioners, unmarried mothers, and others
were the result of two years’ hard
investigation by himself and his Social
Welfare Department. He explained
that extensive surveys had been neces-
sary to discover where both Common-
wealth and State assistance to the
needy was insufficient and to find the
gaps wherein some of the poor were
not given assistance at all.
Mr. Dunstan said none of his Gov-
ernment’s laws and regulations had
given him more personal satisfaction
than the new rates and areas of State
public relief.
Among the more important are:—
• An increase in payments to widows
with children of up to $3.50 where rent
allowances are payable and $7.50 where
rent allowances have not so far been
received.
• Pregnant wives who are widowed
and widows over 50 without children
may now receive $11.50 in State sup-
plementary relief instead of the previous
$4 to $8.25.
• Wives deserted for less than six
months, families of prisoners during the
first six months of imprisonment, and
women and children of de facto rela-
tionships lasting less than three years
are now offered similar rates of assist-
ance to other needy groups.
• Pregnant girls and pregnant deserted
wives, formerly not covered by State
relief and only eligible for special
Commonwealth assistance for six weeks
before confinement, now are covered
by State relief for a period up to 12
weeks before confinement.
• Additional payments of up to $6 per
week may be made to those on social
relief if their housing costs are an
extra hardship.
• Discretionary power for the Director
of Social Welfare to pay unemployed
or sick people at higher rates appro-
priate to long-term relief if this is
considered necessary during long
periods of unemployment or sickness.
• Authority for the Director to make
extra payments beyond the present
scale in cases of special hardship.
Now that South Australia, whose
Government is in a relatively weak fin-
ancial position, has done the homework
and made social-welfare payments both
consistent and comprehensive, it will be
surprising if other and wealthier State
Governments do not follow the lead.




MARCHING INTO THE PAST
By CHARLES HIGHAM
A BRAVE FLOIJIUSH of banners,
gold and blue and scarlet; sunburnt
chests in the blight colors of Manly,
Avalon, or Bondi; a stiff high-step
through the shifting sands of the
Pacific; an excited crowd on the wooden
stands, announcements hoarsely grated
through a loudspeaker, and then a
spartan dash into surf iumbo-size
figures rounding a buov ’ boats rising
and plunging down great' breakers- the
uTfin farnivaH perhaps the one

eally showy public spectacle that Aus-
tralia has created and its hfesaver
stars staunch figures displayed to
the world as advertisements of Aus-
Laban health and vigor - have all
the faintly absurd antique formality of
a brigade of guards.
The parallel with the guards is
deliberate: the surf lifesaver’s old-
fashioned one-piece swimming cos-
tume, worn ceremoniously at carnival
tirne, carefully preserved in the club
between carnivals, is as outmoded and
as necessary to the ritual as a guards-
man s busby, breastplate, and high
boots, and the march past, strutting
with martial precision past a captivated
public, is as formalised as the Chang-
ing of the Guard at Whitehall. The
to ne of surf lifesavers’ lives is as hedged
about with rumor as well: on the sur-
fa ce austerely dedicated, tough and
militarily severe; yet said to be far
lorn th a t, m fact. If lifesaving officials,
tight-lipped as commandos, tell you in
clipped, unpermissive tones that their
members never drink or make passes
at birds on duty, then you have only
to take a trip down the sand through
the sprawling rust-colored bodies to the
canvas enclosure at the edge of the
surf to see blonde girls lofling only
seconds from the reel and line, to see
a sprinkle of beer cans tossed out into
the dunes

° r ° cean Beach became th e burning
ambition of every kid around—and the
sudden discovery that you were, at 17,
earning enough to buy a surfboard —•
the appeal of the clubs dwindled drasti-
cally.
When you could move from beach
to beach as freely as the wind, the
attraction of having a social focus at
your own use was quickly reduced.
More and more teenagers abandoned
the clubs. Why go through the grim
rituals of drill and pounding up and
down pools when you could get just
the same number of birds at the
Canopus Room at Manly they were
practically falling out of the lamp fix-
tures and fun with the other boys
without paying for anything except
the cost of petrol? The lifesaving move-
ment fought back with cries of
Decadence and Our Flabby Youth, but
that made the young people all the
more rebellious toward something they
now (and, perhaps, rightly)'regarded as
a thoroughly middle-aged and fuddy-
duddy institution.
indifference toward lifesaving reached
a state of pure hatred in 1965-66 when
at the height of the anti-board war
officious lifesavers whistled surfies out
of the sea, drove them up to the ends
of the beach or confiscated their boards
by the dozen. At Palm Beach an open
battle took place, with fierce arguments
and finally a spectacular siege as the
lifesavers, Evans told me, rode down
the beach boys with their boats. Reper-
cussions of squabbles and recriminations
went on for months. At the moment,
lifesavers seem to have won, and board
areas are restricted, but this coming
season could well see a recurrence of
these conflicts.
Despite Operation Surfboard and
unpopularity of lifesavers among so
many surfies, the movement has had
a return to strength in the past year
or so. Some lifesavers drift away in
their twenties because they find the
business of marching up and down the
sand in formal procession faintly
ridiculous. (“You’d have to be feeble-
minded to find it glamorous,” Bob
Evans, who used to be a champion life-
saver, told me. “I used to enjoy the
march pasts when I was a kid, but
now I feel they’re a pretty phony form
of expression.”) When lifesavers marry,
social pressures take them more and
more away from lifesaving. But young
people, especially those whose fathers
were lifesavers, or whose ambience has
been the rugged, RSL-cum-lifesaving
world during the formative years, have
been lured back to the colors more and
more by the concerted efforts of life-
saving officials.
Those who do get lured into lifesaving
pay dearly for the social advantages
the life supposedly offers. They begin
as early as 13 or even younger and
have to plough their way up and down
the baths for 400 yards in a cool
minutes. They have to learn an
unaltering and taxing ritual of rescuing
and resuscitation work, of manipulating
reel and line, to get (at 14) their
qualifying certificate and (at 16)
their Bronze. They learn to swim a
patient round a buoy and 200 yards
back to shore in raging seas, to train
two nights a week for hours, and, if
they are keen, swim for miles in the
baths.
Typical of the lifesaving type is
Barry Rodgers, winner of die “Iron
Man” Championship, in which he had
to paddle a surf ski for 175 yards,
paddle a board the same distance, and
swim 150 yards, all in a pounding
sea Barry, ramrod-backed bronzed,
and clear-eyed, told me over beer and
sandwiches that he swims 1£ miles a
day (or 10J miles a week), jog-trots
U p f our miles a day, and has an
equally rugged diet: steak and eggs for
breakfast sandwich lunch steak and
c hi ps for tea. Like many ’ lifesavers I
spoke to, he is a salesman for, of all
things, a cigarette company (perhaps
f n a conscience-stricken mood, Roth-
mans has insured the lives of every life-
saver in the country, and similar firms
often have lifesavers, ironically enough,
on their staffs). Rodgers told me he
puts up with the discipline for the
socialising, which is good enough for
him.
Although girls are plentiful for life-
savers, Ken Watson, secretary of the
SLSA, was typical of the older genera-
tion when he said that “if a boy steps
out 0 f line with a flapper” (sic) “while
on du t y he’s apt to run into trouble
with a club.”
Qne doubts it; but there’s no doubt
that female lifesavers are Not Allowed,
an d that when not open for a function
the clubs are as sacrosanct as monas-
teries (gang-bangs are rumored to take


place quite often, but, in fact, are
probably rare). I asked Ken Watson
about the reason for the lack of female
lifesavers, so much a feature of Jaco-
petti’s notorious “Women of the
World,” an Italian documentary made
a few years ago and showing at Manly
a beautiful blonde giving mouth-to-
mouth resuscitation to a handsome boy.
Watson looked slightly prim: “We
did have female lifesavers at one time.
Sixteen teams. And they were very
good. In some ways better than the
men. But after the carnival they mixed
with the boys and all kinds of things
took place. Necking and so on. And
that was detrimental to the whole life-
saving movement. So, there aren’t any
females in the lifesaving movement
today.”
Clubs have ways and means of deal-
ing with offenders. If you’re caught
cheating in a club race, or are boisterous
on a bus, you are liable to be hauled up
before a formidable judiciary committee
of your erstwhile mates, and glumly
pronounced guilty; if you want to
appeal, you have to go before a State
and then, finally, a Federal body (one
boy who called someone a fool at a
dinner had to go through a prolonged
ordeal of appeals, a kind of surf version
of Caryl Chessman). An Australian
mania for officialdom is reflected in the
considerable relish with which clubs
conduct their judiciary duties.
Watson mentioned that after one
carnival when the boys kissed the girls,
shocked’ officials arranged for the girls
to enter the clubs through special
wooden enclosures, to ensure that their
modesty went unharmed.
Victorian principles: and Judge
Adrian Curlewis was equally stem,
when talking in terms that might
frighten any surfie - half to death
about the splendid destiny of the life-
saver, and the tests of his character.
“It’ll make or break a man. And don’t
get the idea it’s for the type that wants
to big-note himself, to be glamorous.
If anyone looks like being in it for the
honor and glory of being a lifesaver, the
boys are tough and they’ll bring him
down to earth hard.
“You can’t be an individualist in
this game. You might start out as an
individual, but you won’t stay one for
long, believe me. Anyone who stands
outside the social life is weeded out
quick smart in the first year. You’ve
got to keep up the contacts with the
others. We’ve got the spirit of friend-
ship, and that’s something a man
wouldn’t want to shake off, in fact, he
can't shake it off. Something of that
spirit rubs off on to every lifesaver. Get
a man who’s just going to be in parades
and not join in the social events and
he won’t stay in for long, I assure you.
“And just look at the social events
you’ve got. Football and shuttle tennis
and wrestling, and last Christmas North
Bondi held a special show, ‘Cinderella
and the Prince’s Ball,’ where some of
the lads got up in funny clothes and
play-acted and gave the public a good
laugh. Then there’s the New Year’s Eve
Dance and Sunday Night dances.
There’s plenty going on, I can tell you,
and, above all, the appeal in being a
lifesaver is in the March ’ Past. People
say they don’t like the high-step, why do
you do that? How else can you march
on sand? We have fine uniforms, though
we had to discontinue one, it was white
and the Press photographed the chaps
from below and they proved to be in-
decently revealing, so we changed it
and added a skirt. Women? Out. The
belt swim’s too tough for a woman
and besides you can’t have them mixing
with the chaps in the clubs. There’s
danger in that, isn’t there? Liquor?
Out, too; we can’t have licensed clubs.
If we found drink on a premises we’d
punish the club. How? By forbidding it
to appear at a carnival.”
Not only are clubs womanless and
dry, but they are frequently run down,
shabby places with poor amenities.
Judge Curlewis admits that, but says
that too often men work hard on a
club, and then younger members ruin
it: “I recall an incident at Queenscliff
Club. The men built that and made it
'beautiful. And then a new generation
came along and scraped the paint off.
And wrecked the place. The boys
bashed them about a bit, I can tell
you.”
Against the depressed conditions of
lifesavers, the Judge put democracy:
“Lifesavers are a classless society. Doc-
tors, barristers, engineering students,
fishermen, the roustabout in the local
store. Everyone is equal as a lifesaver.
One surf club I shan’t name did keep
Jews out. But I took the secretary of
that club and I grabbed his neck hard,
and I said to him in no uncertain
manner, ‘lf you keep up this anti-
Semitic policy I’m going to push every
tooth in your head down your throat.’ ”
Surf lifesaving clubs may be demo-
cratic, either by force or their own
choice, but they are full of conflicts as
well, governed by complex committees,
riven by interior dissensions. The
N.S.W. branch, Ken Watson told me,
is often at loggerheads with the Federal
body; N.S.W. opposed plans to send
a team to America, failing to take any
interest at first in sending a team to
South Africa.
Ken Watson said he built Surf House
on a personal loan “without God or
man to help me.” He added: “N.S.W.
was too lazy to raise the money to
help me built it. They did nothing,
didn’t say a prayer. Luckily I’m in
good nick or this might have finished
me off. Every stick of furniture you
see here from the mat you walked over
as you came in to the lavatory at the
back was given to us by business firms
out of the goodness of their hearts. I
built Surf House brick by brick. There’s
jealousy toward me in N.S.W. Branch,
Mr. Higham, jealousy, and he who
shouts loudest at N.S.W. committee
meetings is heard best, as the saying
goes.”
As well as shabby clubs, lifesavers
have to put up with outmoded surf
rowboats, when motorised boats (still
coming in here far too slowly) are com-
monplace in America. Curlewis says
that if boats were motorised, the idea
of mountaineering in waves would dis-
appear, that the sense of adventure for
young people would vanish; and he
claimed the motorised boats had a ten-
dency to break in half. The associa-
tion’s Federal and State grants, everyone
complains, are far too meagre, and
private donations inadequate, due
largely to the public’s indifference (one
small business sideline has been dis-
covered by retail stores: Hordern’s make
the reels and lines, and David Jones
make the carnival costumes). Flags,
which cost $65 to $75 each, are paid
for out of sums raised by ladies’ com-
mittees selling jams.
With adolescents put off by a (sup-
posed) lack of drink and women, by
the atmosphere of conflict in the move-
ment, and by the stern authority exer-
cised by some clubs, with judiciary com-
mittees dealing with offences like cheat-
ing in a surf race or drinking in the
clubroom, the association has been
attacking the problem ■ of recruitment
recently by going to a still younger age
group, luring children to the colors.
One of the most bizarre sights along the
N.S.W. coast these days is seeing tiny
tots (or Nippers, as they are known in
the movement) marching solemnly
along the beach with flags that are
smaller replicas of those borne by the
high-stepping elders.
Dreamchild of lifesavers Jim Routh
and John Jones, the Nipper Movement
has lured 5500 children to the color
in N.S.W. alone, and is beginning to
grow rapidly in other States. Routh is
trying to get children officially recog-
nised as resuscitators of the drowning;
and he has developed an odd spectacle
in the junior carnivals, children of be-
tween five and seven running up and
paddling in the surf, a race, sprint,
tug-of-war, flag contest, and wheel-
barrow race. Aborigines now take part
in a carnival as much living proofs
of the democratic principle as Jews in
clubs?
The appeal of all this military strut-
ting up and' down often comes over
strongly to children. If they are the
children of lifesavers, it had better,
but when they become teenagers it’s
a different story. (“My kids are in
the Nippers now,” Bob Evans says, “but
I doubt if they’ll stay with the life-
savers when they turn 14.”) Just how
the lifesaving movement is going to
ensure its future through the teenage
community is uncertain, but that it
will have to modernise its tarnished
image, improve its clubs’ facilities, and
make lifesaving “fun” if that is pos-
sible — 1 is painfully clear. Until these
things happen, many healthy kids are
going to regard the Spartans of the
Surf as, in one sense at least, Strictly
for the Birds.


"This Is Terrific!

Our New Cartridge Stereo.”
Everyone will like making pre-recorded cartridge tapes for
enjoyment in their home, automobile or boat —in fact,
anywhere.
As Akai's latest model, it is everything you expect. Both
the 8-track and 4-track stereo cartridge recording and play-
back are great new developments. The later requires an
adaptor. You can transcribe with only this X-1800SD. All
sources of sounds can be recorded.
Of course, the X-1800SD is an all-solid state tape recorder
with the famous Cross-Field head and 4-track stereo/monaural
recording and playback reel-to-reel.

THE
BRIGHT PEOPLE
Peter Samuel looks at the Australian Reform Movement
The insignificant result in the Senate
elections of the Australian Reform
Movement still leaves open the question:
what do the "Reformers" really stand for?
MOST PEOPLE IN POLITICS tend
to write off the Australian Reform
Movement as another crackpot group
without any future. And it is true, of
course, that new little parties in Aus-
tralia have all failed, except the Coun-
try Party. The others have been
products of breakaways from the exist-
ing major parties.
But the Australian Reform Move-
ment (or the “Refoi'mers” as they call
themselves) just might be an exception
to the rule that you simply cannot weld
a new party out of nothing. For one
thing it has the sort of money which
only the Liberal Party and the ALP
can raise over $lOO,OOO for a cam-
paign. It has three very large busi-
ness patrons, and its membership of
about a thousand are almost all wealthy
enough to contribute heavily, It was
almost inevitable that, at this stage of
our society, some rich men should get
together to spend their money on poli-
tics rather than on racehorses.
The “Reformers” are a very capable,
if as yet small, bunch of people, in
Sydney at least successful, pros-
perous professional and business people.
And Sydney can be taken as a test
of the movement’s potential.
There are arguments about the
origins of the Reform Movement. Some
attribute it to a Labor Party desire to
splinter the Liberal Party, drawing off
preferences in a mirror reverse of the
DLP’s effect on the Labor vote. Others
see its formation as linked somehow
with the dispute its two leading figures
had with the Government over trans-
port licences. Another theory is that
it was a communist-inspired move to
harness to the Vietnam protest move-
ment the more snooty people in the
community who would not take part
in the conventional demonstrations and
rallies of the regular peace fronts.
The Reformers have the simple ex-
planation that the Liberal Reform
Group, as it was first called, grew as
a spontaneous reaction by completely
separated individuals to an Open Let-
ter to LBJ by businessman Gordon
Barton, which filled a full page of
the “Sydney Morning Herald” in
October, 1966.
The motive force was, and continues
to be, a basic and intense disapproval of
what Australia is doing in Vietnam. This
has led to a completely hardline policy
of withdrawal, to be arranged with the
communist insurgents, who should then
be allowed to take over: “We should
withdraw our forces by arrangement with
the NLF as soon as practicable.” The
Labor Party is attacked for being “half
the way with LBJ.”
The objective of Mr. Barton’s group
at the time of its formation before the
last House of Representatives election
was to “tip the Government out” and
with this in mind they put up candidates
in 21 seats (12 in Sydney, nine in Mel-
bourne) they regarded as being possible
swingei's to the ALP, offeiing Labor their
preferences. Then Mr. Barton sent his
px'etentious, if sincere, ultimatum to Mr.
Holt: Pull out of Vietnam or we will
continue to stand against you, in which
case your chance of re-election as
Prime Minister will be equivalent to
that of “a snowball in a furnace.”
The furnace did not fire. Thei'e was a
big swing against Labor to Mr. Holt and
the “marginal seats” in which Refoi'm
candidates wei'e placed l'eturned solid
Liberal majorities. Angrily Mr. Baxton
wrote: “A majority of well-fed, semi-
Christian Babbits have voted for violence
abroad and respectable inertia at home
. . . for military intervention as the
solution for the pi'oblems of Asia, for
provocation as the necessary path to
understanding with China, and sub-
servience as the pi'ice of Amei’ican pro-
tection.” But the saving grace was that,
unlike others, “most who supported
Libei'al Reform did so as a matter of
moral principle.”
In Victoi'ia, of the 26,000 votes a
lot undoubtedly supported Liberal
Reform by mistake, since, like the
adjective “cooking” on those flashy mai'-
garine packages, the Liberal Reform
How-to-Vote cards carried the words
“Reform” very faintly indeed. How-
ever, we can accept Mr. Barton’s claim
in respect of the N.S.W. vote of 28,000
as members of a moral band. The prin-
cipals in the movement were evidently
bitterly disappointed not only in the
ovei'all vote for Holt and Vietnam but
in the smallness of their own vote. But
most outside observers found it larger
than they had expected. In N.S.W.,
despite the fact that mai'garine promo-
tion pi'actices wei'e avoided, the Group
managed to get between 3 and 7 per-
“Reformers” plan the Senate campaign: informal administration


cent of the vote in each of the seats it
contested, immediately putting it out of
the class of the miniscule no-hoper
parties, and suggesting it had the poten-
tial for developing into a sort of Leftist
DLP.
Most wanted the movement to con-
tinue and be formalised into a political
party. The only serious losses were
solicitor Mr. John Mant and lately Mr.
John Crew (1966 Reform candidates
for St. George and Parkes). For the
rest the gain in style and approach of
Mr. Whitlam as new leader of the Labor
Party was offset by his equivocation
over Vietnam, and so the ALP remained
as unattractive as ever. Moreover, the
enthusiasm and camaraderie of the
election campaign was enough to sustain
it.
It has established a membership and
an informal organisation based on sub-
urban groups. There are some 42 of
these in the Sydney metropolitan area
(most in the posh North Shore line)
with an average of 20 active members
each. The Group conveners meet
monthly to make broad decisions on
policy matters and transmit directions
back to the membership. The bulk of
administrative work and detailed de-
cision making appears to be done by-
small informal policy sub-committees.
So far the movement is working without
any constitution or rules and without
any clear lines of authority. In these
circumstances “founder and leader” Mr.
Gordon Barton and a small group of
selected people around him run the
show.
Mr. Barton is a reporter’s dream, a
pleasant, quiet-spoken, slight man with
a constant stream of quotable quotes.
He speaks and appears also to think,
too, in an uninterrupted series of
aphorisms and analogies.
“Without a constitution and organis-
ation how do you make decisions?” I
asked him? Typically, he replied:
“When I was studying law I had a
lecturer called McClelland, a judge
now, who once told us: two things
always naturally rise to the top
cream and scum.” When I asked him
how he got rid of the scum, he
answered: “It’s pretty simple, really.
It’s remarkable how you can separate
them out by a little gentle discourage-
ment.”
People who are not wanted gradu-
ally fade out of the movement, when
they stop being invited to the little
informal meetings which make the
decisions. Mr. Francis James, a valu-
able celebrity during the early months
of the movement, now seems to have
disappeared. But there is to be a
“National Convention” in February
next year to approve some rules and
formalise the structure, so the Move-
ment may not continue to be run in
so highly personal a manner. And it
may not always be able to attack other
parties for their “undignified and ill-
concealed internal power struggles.”
But an elitist personal style already
permeates the thinking of the Move-
ment, to an extent unparalleled in any
other political party. As for adherents
of Moral Re-Armament, for Reformers
we live in a world run by a small
number of Great Men, and what hap-
pens in the world is a product of the
integrity and ability of the great few.
There are no real problems, no deep-
rooted social forces, or difficult-to-
reconcile differences of interest or
perception.
Our problems are basically attribu-
table to individual selfishness and
stupidity. “The world’s leaders are not
really very bright people,” Gordon
Barton told me as an aside in one
of several sporadic conversations on
Vietnam. Also: “For the life of me
I cannot understand why Wilson and
Kosygin don’t do more to end the
war.”
In order for Australia to really get
with Asia, become a bridge between
East and West and all that stuff, we
need “a new foreign policy based on
faith, understanding, and co-operation,
instead of fear, ignorance, and vio-
lence.” And Mr. Barton boils it all
down to personal qualities when he
says: “The same degree of moral in-
tegrity, tolerance, and trust as re-
quired in normal transactions between
individuals is all that is necessary to
effect this.” Reformers find it im-
possible to believe that there might be
movements like Mao’s or Sukarno’s
with which even the most accommoda-
ting or obsequious diplomacy could
not cope. Difficulties other countries
have with China are attributed to the
fact that we “insult China at every
opportunity.”
If there is an old world touch to the
Basic Platform of the Reform Move-
ment which pledges, first up, “Loyalty
to the British Throne,” in most other
ways their foreign policy is radical.
The American Alliance, which both
Mr. Holt and Mr. Whitlam in their
own ways say is the crux of our foreign
policy, is dismissed with contempt:
“Like motherhood and kindness to
animals, everyone is for it.” Which
brings out Mr. Barton’s intense nation-
alism, or perhaps more simply his
anti - Americanism. “Our Vietnam
policy,” he says, getting back to his
great concern, “must be to disidentify
ourselves from the Americans in the
most convincing and obvious way.”
Or more generally: “We believe Aus-
tralia should stand on its own two
feet. We want to restrict foreign in-
vestment in this country and get rid
of the political and financial influence
of America.” Occasionally he degener-
ates into a sort of 1890 s nationalist
rhetoric: “We must build a greater
Australia, with its own industries built
on its own ideas and its own ideals.”
Constantly trying to be the Whit-
lamite, to see how he might argue
with those who might be tempted to
follow new-look Labor, I asked him
about Mr. Whitlam’s theme that
America is moving to the Left and that
the hardliners are being displaced by
the Bobby Kennedys, the Mansfields,
the Percys, the Romneys, the Ful-
brights. To this Mr. Barton replied
curtly: “Let us wait until they are
in fact running America and then have
another look at it.” I wasn’t enough
of a Whitlamite to be able to come
back at that one. Mr. Barton is against
all alliances, even with neighboring
countries with stable, progressive,
solidly based, representative govern-
ments. “Don’t you think,” I asked him,
“we should show some solidarity with
a government like Singapore in the
case of an attack on them by, say,
Indonesia or Malaysia?” To this he
responded with a homily: “You know
the story of the man who tried to
break up the fight between the husband


. Cog
GAULOISES
(prmmced GAWL-
WAHZ
OAULOISES
m
and the wife. As soon as he intervened
they both turned on him.”
But if the Reformers are isolationist
they are certainly not pacifist. “Aus-
tralia should become an armed fort-
ress” and follow, in the words of Mr.
Barton, “a policy of independence
based on strength on the Swedish or
Swiss pattern,” as recommended by
people like Mr. Max Teichman of
Monash University. With consistency,
Mr. Barton then suggested an ambitious
defence policy, remarkably similar to
that of the Democratic Labor Party:
universal conscription of two years for
all young men, intended to build a
standing army of 100,000 and a readily
mobilisable force of a million (that
goes beyond the DLP), the acquisition
of nuclear weapons, and the expan-
sion of our submarine fleet. Incident-
ally, conscientious objectors to mili-
tary service are to be given the option
of working for subsistence salaries on
Australian development projects or
providing cheap labor for an Australian
overseas shipping line proposals
hardly designed to endear the Move-
ment to the AWU or the Seamen’s
Union.
But if foreign policy has been the
moving force behind the Australian Re-
form Movement, Mr. Barton has linked
it to his domestic policy rather neatly.
“It is time to stop making war in
Asia and to start building a better
Australia,” one of his favorite slogans
reads. The link is a rather nice theory
of international relations: “If we want
to influence political trends in Asia
from dictatorship toward democracy,
the success of our example (in build-
ing a Great Society in Australia) will
be far stronger than the force of our
arms.”
Mr. Barton believes that about four-
fifths of his support so far comes from
people attracted to the movement by
its line on Vietnam. He relies a good
deal on the discovery of lots of Hanna-
fords, claiming that 20 percent of
Liberal Party supporters are against
the Government on Vietnam. But he
says the organisation is developing a
momentum which should enable it to
carry on even if somehow Vietnam
should be suddenly removed from
political controversy. He sees his base
in 20 percent of the electorate, some
800,000 people, “the intelligent, success-
ful middle class, currently lacking a
means of political expression, the pros-
perous salariat.” He hopes to get the
“professional non-joiners” to join.
These are the people Mr. Barton thinks
are most likely to be increasingly re-
pelled by the existing political parties
- by the Liberals because of “provoca-
tion abroad and inertia at home” and
by Labor because of its working-class
character and its “undignified and ill-
concealed internal power struggles.”
He has a number of policies designed
to attract specific groups. For the
nation’s 100,000 schoolteachers he
promises a syndicalist system of teacher-
run schools, in place of the present
departmental and headmastered set-
up. Australian Reform is the only group
against State aid to independent schools
“subsidising the Roman Church” is
his phrase for it. “We’ll probably get
more votes on that one than on Viet-
nam,” he said to me in a rare expres-
sion of earthy political thinking.
If the Movement has any other
appeals they must lie in Mr. Barton’s
general style and approach to Aus-
tralian politics. He wants a more fluid
society, with better leadership: “Our
leaders are at the tail end of society,
and they are thoroughly resistant to
new ideas. Ideas batter to penetrate
the barriers, yet once they are in they
become deified and indestructible.
We’re developing a spectator society, a
waiting and watching mentality.” He
then developed this theme with a
metaphor suitable to Sydney’s garden-
loving North Shore: “What this
country needs is a deep topsoil of
leadership and a more sophisticated
compost of ideas to grow in. There is
a general lack of fertility. We are
attacking the mediocrity and moral
cynicism of Australian political life
and the social apathy that tolerates it
55
The contribution Australian Reform
sees itself making is to attract new
sorts of persons into politics. They
have been remarkably successful in
getting men successful in other voca-
tional fields into their movement
architect Harry Seidler, physics pro-
fessor Peter Mason, rags-to-riches
transport man Ken Thomas, and
white-collar union leader Paul Allsop
for the Senate team in N.S.W. One can
assume, of course, that the readiness
of these gentlemen to stand for office
was connected with the unlikelihood
of their getting it.
These are examples of the “new
type of political person, a sort of
non-politican” whom Mr. Barton hopes
to introduce into Australian politics.
So far they seem disinclined to have a
go in the State parliamentary sphere.
If Mr. Seidler really wanted to get
things done in his field and to con-
tribute his architectural and planning
skills, one would would think he would
go into State politics. The same might
be thought to apply for Professor
Mason with his ideas for educational
reform.
But to me, anyway, there is rather
an air of unreality and gesturing about
the whole exercise. The inside cover
of the National Policy of the Aus-
tralian Reform Movement rather sums
up the thing. It is a quote from none
other than Field-Marshal Montgomery:
“There are in this world things that
are true and things that are false;
there are ways that are right and ways
that are wrong; there are men good
and men bad . . .” If politics, or life,
for that matter, is a series of choices
and compromises between what is
principled and what is possible, then
those who take principle that seriously
just aren’t quite with us.

All the way with
BY DONALD HORNE
ALL OF US who were connected
with the old colonial system rulers
and subjects alike have had to re-
define how we think of ourselves and
how we see the world since that sys-
tem collapsed. When the British Em-
pire still existed, Australians thought
of themselves principally in relation
to the British. Some Australians were
more British than the British, some
were intensely anti-British. (Nine-
teenth-century Australian nationalism
flourished a generation or two before
the nationalism of some other countries
in the South-East Asia and South-West
Pacific area.) But even the nationalists
defined their nationalism largely in
terms of how much better a place Aus-
tralia was than Britain. Not only in
its greater concern for equality and
fraternity was Australia superior to
Britain; it was also somehow better to
be a wide, brown-grassed and sunburnt
country, even a partly desert country,
than a green, wet little country like
England.
By World War I, when the first
round of Australian nationalism reached
its peak, although Australia saw itself
as coming to the assistance of the
Mother Country, it was with the pride
of a son who sees himself as better
than his parents. In the literature of
the time, Australian soldiers were des-
cribed as more comradely than the
British, moi'e independent-minded and
contemptuous of authority, better
fighters, of course, but also taller and
with more handsome faces. But it was
still the British they compared them-
selves with and when they looked at
other European nations they saw them
as the British saw them: the French and
Italians were excitable and unreliable,
the Germans were brutal barbarians,
and so forth. For some reason only
Turks were seen in a way diffei'ent
from the British view: to the Australians
who fought them at Gallipoli, Turks
were seen as being almost as much
human beings as Australians. (There
is now an attempt to increase Turkish
immigration to Australia.)
Between the wars the old-style Aus-
tralian nationalism eroded. There was
too much of a rural ethos about it, too
much of the myths of the “bush” for
it to affect policy in what was already
one of the most urban communities in
the world, and, while nationalism con-
tinued in a rather effete way as one
of the elements in intellectual life and
continued to play some role in the
Labor movement, Australia went
through a very provincial period in
which all of the important decisions
seemed to be made somewhere else. At
that stage, stocked overwhelmingly by
people of British and Irish origin, Aus-
tralia for a while saw the world as if
Australia were an island in the Irish
Channel, between Britain and Ireland.
(Did some Filipinos at this same time
perhaps see themselves as an island in
the Atlantic, between America and
Spain?)
The exceptions were those who saw
Australia as a nation threatened by
the hordes of Asia. The slogan “Popu-
late—or Perish!” had some currency in
the 19305, expressing that sense of
catastrophe that is as much part of
the Australian character as its post-
Copernican optimism, and which may
have come from the disappointments
from the frontier of land settlement in
Australia as hopes dissipated in the hot,
arid interior. In the style of the
times, being of European origin, Aus-
tralians saw themselves as superior to
other races, but their realism made
them see earlier than most that
Japanese expansionism might provide a
threat to the whole of Asia and there-
fore to Australia.
When the militarists took over in
Japan there was a return to a theme
that had already occurred in Australian
history—that Australia might be swept
away by an alien invader. At first it
had been the French, who were seen
as the possible destroyers of Australia,
during the Napoleonic wars; then, in
the mid-century, Sydney put up a fort
to defend itself from the oncoming
Russians; now, as well as Hitler, who
seemed remote, there were the Japanese.
Nevertheless, when the Japanese
destroyed European colonial power
South-East Asia, seized parts of the Aus-
tralian territory in New Guinea, and
sent midget submarines into Sydney
Plarbor, Australians suffered a sen e
of shock which their long sense of im-
pending catastrophe did not in any
way soften. It was then that the first
of the two major changes in Australian
foreign policy occurred. (Perhaps it
might be more exact to say that it was
then that Australian foreign policy was
created.) The Australians realised that,
even though they were assembling a
powerful army, only American power,
especially American sea and air power,
could save them. It was true that an
Australian land force, at the Battle of
Milne Bay in New Guinea, had given
the Japanese their first land defeat in
the war, but only the American Navy
could have fought the Battle of the
Coral Sea, the first real step in the
safeguarding of Australia. John Curtin,
then Prime Minister, dramatised this
new situation when he said: “Without
any inhibitions of any kind, I make it
quite clear that Australia looks to
America, free of any pangs as to our
traditional links of kinship with the
United Kingdom.”
Except for a period in the late 19405,
this has remained the basis of Aus-
tralian policy. Australian attitudes to
Asia are colored by the fear that in an
unstable area some further catastrophe
can occur which might threaten the
very existence of Australia. No sooner
was Japan defeated than China took its
place in the Australian imagination as
a power that might gain control of
South-East Asia and then threaten an
Australia deserted by the world. For
17 years, American friendship has been
seen as the main insurance against
such a catastrophe. To the keenest sup-
porters of the American alliance for-
malised in the ANZUS Treaty, friend-
ship with the States of South-East Asia
was of tangential importance: what
really mattered was Australian friend-
ship with America.
It should be understood that Aus-
tralians seem almost uniquely able to
get on well with Americans without
resentment. They even forgave the
Americans for helping them save them-
selves from the Japanese. It does not
hurt an Australian’s dignity to feel that
ultimately the sovereignty of his nation
might depend on American power.
Earlier it had depended on British
power and many Australians find it
easier to got on with Americans than
with upper-middle-class Englishmen.


This article first appeared in “Solidarity,” a Filipino magazine. Its attempt to put Australia
into a perspective that would make sense in the Philippines may also make sense in Australia.
However, in approaches to American
policy in Asia, during the long rule
of Sir Robert Menzies, the Govern-
ment preferred never to criticise Ameri-
can policy publicly, not even in the
smallest detail, so that as far as speeches
were concerned Australia could be
attacked as a kind of American stooge
in Asia. That this did not often hap-
pen was probably due to the fact that
in actual operation, compared with
what the politicians made speeches
about, Australian policy differed in a
number of ways from American policy.
Menzies’ reticence may have been
due partly to his provincialism he
was still “loyal” to Britain, and per-
haps he made the Americans honorary
Britishers but there is also another
factor, which may account for the fact
that Mr. Holt, who, although he is
inclined to lecture the British, neverthe-
less said that, on Vietnam, he was
“all the way with LBJ.” This state-
ment, bitterly attacked by those Aus-
tralians who want more oratorical
evidence of Australian “independence,”
can be understood only if it is recog-
nised that Australians find it unmanly
to publicly attack a friend. In the
jargon of the old nationalism, America
is now Australia’s greatest “mate” and
it would be unmatelike to make public
criticism, whatever might be said in
private.
Australians make particularly firm
friends and, since a whole part of their
sense of tradition is' connected with
sending military expeditions overseas,
they are prepared to pay the price of
friendships. The battalions they sent to
Korea, to Malaysia, and now to Viet-
nam were evidence of their acceptance
of the price of alliance. Yet they were
also evidence of an Australian ten-
dency to see East and South-East Asia
as a kind of Australian frontline and
to see the Australian role in South-
East Asia as partly that of a police-
man’s unhappy lot.
If this were all there was to it, the
Australians could be criticised for play-
ing a selfish and short-sighted role in
South-East Asia. However, there is
another strain in Australian policy that,
especially among the young, may be
transforming Australian attitudes so
that not only Australian policy but
Australia itself is going through a re-
definition. (The connection between
the two is obvious: foreign policy is
one of the important forms of de-
fining national identity. It tells you
who you are.)
In the late 1940 s Australian policy
was one of support for national in-
dependence movements —the support
for the Indonesians against the Dutch
continued to be remembered in Djakarta
—and, in general, for speaking up for
small nations against big ones. Oratory
became more conservative when Men-
zies took over in the 19505. His
policy of loyally sticking by Australia’s
“great and powerful friends” led him
into several propaganda defeats on the
world scene and, perhaps mainly be-
cause of its involvement in New Guinea,
Australian policy at the United Nations
took a pro-colonialist hue (although this
has lessened lately). But it was on the
initiative of one of Menzies’ Foreign
Ministers that the Colombo Plan was
formed and in many other ways, at
many levels, Australians have responded
to the recognition that they are where
they are on the map. Some of them
are now concerning themselves with the
thought that a nation where the ideals
of human brotherhood found a greater
place in national rhetoric than in almost
any other nation should now test those
ideals by extending them to other races.
The two social revolutions that have
been successfully concluded- in the
South-East Asia/South-West Pacific area
were those of Australia and New Zea-
land and they were concluded before
change in most of the rest of the world
began, yet, although Australia’s in-
dividual actions were better than its
words, overall policy did not adopt
the rhetoric of social revolutions.
Menzies’ imagination was not much
touched by Asia.
The necessity to come to terms with
Asia was for him mainly a problem
that arose after the Communist victory
in China. It was connected with his
continuing successful exploitation of
issues of domestic Communism and the
leftward swing of the fractured Opposi-
tion Labor Party that was the main
reason for the length of his period of
office. In this context his concern was
almost entirely with strategic stability:
social and economic changes of a kind
that took place in Australia more than
100 years ago could to him seem merely
threats to that stability if they were
spoken of in South-East Asia.
With the change in Prime Minister-
ship all this has changed. Mr. Holt may
still see Washington as pivotal in the
world (and is it not?), but London is
now the place where he reads the Eng-
lish lectures on their neglect of South-
East Asia, and it was to nations in
South-East Asia that he made his first
official visits, Cambodia as well as Viet-
nam, Laos as well as Thailand. He has
now accepted the phrase “social revolu-
tion” as part of Australian policy, as
a policy that sees the need for the ful-
filment in South-East Asian nations of
those aspirations that have been so
successfully filled in Australia that, in
domestic terms, it is difficult for Aus-
tralians to decide what it is that they
should aspire to next, their very success
driving some of them to externalise
their aspirations on to the peoples of
neighboring nations.
I have skimmed over the main ele-
ments in Australia’s attitudes to
South-East Asia since the Japanese War
because, in discussing Australia’s pos-
sible future role in South-East Asia, it
is realistic to look at its past perform-
ance. It is out of the conflicts and limi-
tations of existing attitudes that future
policy arises, along with the external
shocks produced by unexpected events.
To these must be added considera-
tions of strategic strength. In terms of
population alone, with its 12,000,000
people, Australia is merely at the top
of the range of small powers and this
smallness provides a limit to its role.
However, its economic prosperity is so
much greater than that of any of its
neighbors, greater indeed, in per capita
terms than all the countries of the
world except for North America, than
which it is less, and the Scandinavian
countries and Switzerland, with which
it is equal, that this gives it a special
dimension of importance in South-East
Asia. Although New Guinea represents
a drain on resources, there is still
enough left for Australia to play a part

in aid programs. In this connection,
what may be even more important
than wealth is that Australia’s high
degree of “westernisation” (tech-
nological skills, acceptance of change,
etc.) makes it a suitable partner in
training programs in more static socie-
ties. In addition, Australia, for the
size of its population, is rich in most
of the natural resources, mineral re-
sources as well as foodstuffs and fibres,
so that it is at the top of the middle
range (or at the bottom of the top
range) of the world’s trading nations.
It is also a nation in which the military
tradition is strong and, while its military
forces are comparatively small, the com-
bination of skill, bravery, and wealth
means that Australia could quickly
expand into a military power of formid-
able importance in South-East Asia, a
military ally worth having.
So here is a nation small in num-
bers, rich in resources and “westernisa-
tion,” important in world trade, with a
military potential comparatively strong
in the area where it exists. Tradi-
tionally it did not see itself as part of
the area, but it does so now. Its tradi-
tional obsession with Britain has
eroded (and in a few years may alto-
gether collapse), but a residual friend-
ship is likely to remain. It sees power
as finally being resident in Washing-
ton; it sees its trading prosperity in
terms of Japan, Britain, America, and
China; but it has also shown a growing
interest in closer regional co-operation,
an interest that, with a change in
political leadership, is now explicit. Its
interest in its neighbors was first
aroused when they were seized by the
Japanese, and then continued because
it feared they might fall into the power
of the Chinese, but now the interest
also exists for its own sake. One of its
traditional views of the world is that
it is a place where there are allies, and
that from time to time military expe-
ditions are sent off out into the world,
partly as the price of alliance, partly in
self-interest. Its interest in material pro-
gress and in the extension of prosperity
and freedom to the common man has
been one of its distinctive character-
istics: previously this interest has been
self-centred, but now it is spreading
outwards: it can be made seem entirely
reasonable to Australians that other
peoples should enjoy what Australians
themselves enjoy and that traditional
societies can be uprooted to suit this
purpose. While it has pursued an im-
migration policy based on tests of race
that discriminate against all its neigh-
bors, this policy is now widely
opposed; it 'has been slightly amended
by the Government, and the Govern-
ment’s conservatism is now based not
so much on racialism as on a fear of
importing communal discord. At the

same time, the doctrines of fraternal-
ism have been more highly developed
in Australia than in most other coun-
tries, and there are now pressures that
these doctrines should be externalised.
Finally, the idea that Australia is also
“Asian” or, to put it more moderately,
that it can pay a fraternal role among
its neighbors could become an im-
portant part of the rhetoric of Aus-
tralian national self-definition.
Given all this, what is likely to
happen? If the tone of its politics
remains as it is, no great initiatives
are likely to be taken by Australia.
Australian politics swings between
conservative and innovatory stages. The
last innovatory stage ended somewhere
in the early 1950 s and there is for the
moment no sign of another one com-
ing up. As things stand now, only some
sense of immediate danger might push
the present government into some un-
characteristic act of initiative but, with
an anti-Peking Government in Djakarta,
and with some kind of de facto live-and-
let-live relationship existing between
Indonesia and Malaysia and between
Malaysia and Singapore, Australia’s im-
mediate environment is now more
peaceful than it has been for more than
ten years. So far as Vietnam is con-
cerned, this is obviously ■ a matter be-
yond any Australian initiative.
If the present kind of strategic posi-
tion prevails, Australia’s role is likely
to be determined by the initiatives
taken by others. With its present in-
volvement in Vietnam, America has no
initiatives for South-East Asia. Nor
perhaps should it have. It seems a
better role for the American to sup-
port what the States of South-East
Asia decide about common action (if
they decide anything) than to try to
impose initiative of its own. The
countries of Western Europe have little
interest in the area and no initiative
is likely to come from them. So far
as Britain is concerned, Australian
initiative was concerned with trying to
slow down departure so as to avoid
its more disruptive effects. Of distant
powers, only Japan is, for the present,
likely to show new initiative in South-
East Asia, but what Japan does depends
on how Japan decides to see itself. Is
it an Asian power? An oceanic power?
A Pacific power? A world power, with
no special interest in any special area?
If the Japanese should define a
special interest in South-East Asia, this
will immediately involve Australia.
The Japanese would expect Australian
support and this would again raise for
Australia the problems of attitude it
has already experienced in its relations
with Britain and with America: how
far does it go in mateship with a big
brother? All the way with Japan? Or
does it use its connection with, its

special interest in and its knowledge
of the South-East Asia area to try to
amend a great power’s policy to the
special interests of the area? As an
adviser of the Americans on South-
East Asia, Australia did not get very
far. Yet this would seem a useful role
that, as the only thoroughly modernised
and prosperous society in the area,
Australia should try to act as some-
thing of an intermediary or spokesman
with any major- modernised power
that develops policies toward the area.
There is a lot of talk in several dif-
ferent nations in East and South-East
Asia about how this or that nation is
“the link between East and West”
yet, of all of them, Australia, when it
next has a policy of strong independent
initiative, would be the best qualified
for that role.
But merely putting up diplomatic
ideas is not enough. There has to be
some power behind them the power
of an army, or of money, or of propa-
ganda. Even if Australia had wanted to
play a stronger role with the Ameri-
cans than it attempted, it would have
been playing from weakness. Its mili-
tary forces were denuded in the ’fifties;
its aid programs were modest and
scattered, and, while its diplomatic ser-
vice was first class, Menzies’ main
propaganda theme was the nostalgia of
“God Save the Queen.” Menzies’ neg-
lect of armed strength is now being
remedied, but mainly in bits and pieces,
without coherent policy, and not up to
potential. So far as Japan is concerned,
an Australia with greater military power
could play a more independent role if a
British entry into the Common Market
meant that Australia began buying
from Japan more of the things it now
buys from Britain. It would not be
impossible for Australia to be, after
America, Japan’s second best customer,
and that would provide a negotiable
strength.
However, for the moment, if any
initiatives for new policies are to occur,
they may be likely to come from
groupings of the States of South-East
Asia themselves. If some of these States
formed a regional group, co-operating
in economic matters, and perhaps mili-
tary matters as well, and there was
some sense in what was arranged, this
would provide an external initiative to
which Australian policy could react, if
it was invited to do so. It would also
get Australia out of a problem that
might otherwise arise that it might
be expected to play favorites as between
one State and its rival. Not that Aus-
tralia has not already become skilled in
detaching itself from quarrels that are
none of its business.
Thus it enjoyed a kind of special
relation with each of the disputant
nations of Singapore and Malaysia;
during Sukarno’s “Crush Malaysia”
campaign, although Australian forces
were lined up against Sukarno, doors
were still open to Australians in
Djakarta and the embassy was not
stoned.
Nevertheless, a regional grouping
would enable Australia to disentangle
itself from a special relationship with
the old area of British influence and to
co-operate in a genuine regional policy.
If this included some military arrange-
ments, Australia would be a valuable
and trustworthy ally. If it were an
economic grouping, Australia’s role
might be more that of friend or associ-
ate rather than that of a full member,
since the Australian economy is so dif-
ferent from that of its neighbors that
full co-operation might be impossible
or very .much to the disadvantage of
either the regional group or of Aus-
tralia. The peculiar economic position
of Australia mainly “colonial” in
its exports of raw or roughly processed
materials and mainly “developed” in
its highly industrialised domestic
economy docs, however, make it an
excellent spokesman for those develop-
ing societies which are mainly raw-
material exporters and indeed Aus-
tralia has already become such a skilled
spokesman for such societies at inter-
national conferences that some Aus-
tralians see themselves as belonging
to an underdeveloped society.
One of Australia’s difficulties in de-
veloping regional relationships is that
its resources are spread widely for their
size. New Guinea makes big and special
demands in skills and money and these
are not likely to diminish with indepen-
dence. The Colombo Plan spreads be-
yond the South-East Asia area. As well
as South-East Asia, many Australians
also have a special interest in India.
And there are still vestigial urges to
resume the exciting policy-on-every-
thing role that was pursued in the
late 1940 s in the United Nations. I
was talking to some young Africans
who were visiting Australia recently
and they complained that Australians
were far too parochial. “You’re not
interested in anything except Asia,”
one of them said. “You should play a
bigger role in Africa.” In the same
conversation an Australian trainee
diplomat complained that Australians
did not take an active enough interest
in Latin America. To some of the
young what seemed revolutionary a few
years ago that Australia should play
a part in the affairs of South-East
Asia now seems timid, parochial,
and old hat.
To this writer it would seem desir-
able that Australia concentrate more,
not less, on South-East Asia, concen-
trating its resources so that it can in-
crease its activity in the area, especially
if the area begins to show signs of
new initative and independent enter-
prise. This still leaves room for con-
tinuing relations with Japan and India,
Britain and America, but it could
mean that some other parts of the
world might grow rather blank in the

That a flanged wheel turns easily on a steel rail is a simple
fact of immense importance to Australia. Were it not for
the constant turning of such a wheel in this country of
vast distances, transport costs inevitably would be much
higher. Historically, on the turning of that wheel the
whole structure of the nation’s transport charges have
come to be based.
Whether it’s passengers or freight, nothing moves traffic
over land as quickly, efficiently or economically as rail-
ways. Only a train can haul 1,000 tons of freight at a single
lift and at high, sustained speeds over vast distances,
with minimum of manpower, fuel, effort. Ton-mile for
ton-mile, trains take the high cost out of transport.
Another thing. Australia’s railways are government-
owned, are not operated essentially for profit but to pro-
vide necessary freight and passenger services for Aus-
tralia’s people. Support for the Railways of Australia is
support for a century old, century tried and tested policy
of common-sense transport costs from which all Aus-
tralians benefit.

Australian imagination. Whether or not
there is a regional grouping, there is
still opportunity for the multi-level
contacts and activities between Aus-
tralians and others who live in the
area that will take Australia further
out of its provincialism and make pos-
sible that growing confidence and re-
definition of role that will further de-
velop distinctive Australian nationhood.
I have argued elsewhere that this
process must later include a constitu-
tional break with Britain, destroying
the present fiction that the Queen of
England is also the Queen of Aus-
tralia.
Something more than a token
change might be necessary in another
Australian habit the habit of high
tariff protection. It is true that Aus-
tralia industrialised and achieved its
prosperity behind a tariff wall, but
now it would seem to be in the in-
terests both of Australia and of its
neighbors that it should begin dis-
mantling those bits of that wall that
hinder the purchase from Australia’s
neighbors of some of those things that
they make that are better or cheaper
than our own goods. In Australia this
would lower some costs and put Aus-
tralian export industries in better
order; for Australia’s neighbors it
would provide the best of all forms of
economic aid an expansion of
trade. This is one matter in which a
regional group, if formed, could be
given special concessions.
The most relevant of all challenges,
of course, is the challenge to the tradi-
tional immigration policy. Some of
Australia’s neighbors, aware of the
tragedies of their own communal dis-
cord, might well have some sympathy
for the present Australian hesitancies
about change. But a much faster rate of
reform than has already been attempted
would now seem a safe experiment.
The immigration of continental
Europeans has not led to the tensions
that critics had feared. There seems
every reason to believe that the immi-
gration of “westernised” Asians could
be equally free of tension. It should
be Australia’s objective gradually to
put itself in a position in which it
can truly claim that its immigration
tests are merely those of socio-economic
homogeneity. It should be Australia’s
ambition to demonstrate that a socially
and economically homogeneous society
is possible even if it is racially mixed.
The world once had the hope that it
would discover some great Southland.
A future Australia could demonstrate
that this hope was not illusory, that a
people of multi-racial origin, inter-
married so successfully that the shapes
of eyes and noses and the color of skins
lost meaning, could live with tolerance
and decency, existing as one nation,
and indifferent to their physical origins.


OVERSEAS
The U.S. keeps cool on gold
From ANTHONY HOWARD in Washington
ONE NIGHT this week, almost cer-
tainly more by accident than design,
the two main American television net-
works devoted a major part of their
evening news bulletins to demonstrating
to the nation that there really was
$13,000 million worth of gold still rest-
ing safe and secure in Fort Knox.
■ Astonishingly, that has been about
the only public sign here of any ner-
vousness arising out of the European
gold rush and its built-in threat to the
future of the United States dollar.
At the Treasury, callers have had
their attention directed merely to the
President’s two statements in which he
affirmed the U.S.’s commitment to con-
tinue “to buy and sell gold at the exist-
ing price of $35 an ounce.”
What need the question is polite
but firm can there possibly be for
any further discussion? The President
has spoken, and that is that.
In contrast to Europe, the U.S. has
been playing it remarkably cool
throughout the whole of this week s
crisis. There is even evidence of a good
deal of irritation with the stories
emanating from London of a diabolical
French plot to humble the U.S. through
eroding confidence in its currency. That
kind of approach is briskly dismissed
as being more inflamatory than illum-
inating.
One reason for the official American
sang-froid lies, of course, in the fact
that the U.S. is not facing this type
of crisis for the first time. Fears for
the stability of the dollar, and appre-
hension as to its vulnerability to a
concerted European gold drain, haunted
the opening months of the Kennedy
Administration.
“I know,” President Kennedy is re-
ported to have said in a prophetic
moment, “that everyone thinks I worry
too much about the balance of pay-
ments position-. But it’s a club that de
Gaulle and all the others hang over
my head. Any time there’s a crisis or
a quarrel they can cash in all their
dollars and then where are we?”
Having had to live with the threat
for so long, and, indeed, come through
one earlier crisis of confidence in the
dollar at the time of the Cuban con-
frontation in October, 1962, the
Administration understandably has not
found it much of a strain publicly to
adopt an unruffled, almost blase,
attitude.
How much of all this is mere shrewd
Secretary of U.S. Treasury, Henry
Fowler, tells a Washington news confer-
ence that following Britain’s devaluation
the dollar is “in the front line”
public relations and how much is based
on actual solid confidence? With
virtually all U.S. Treasury officials now
in voluntary purdah it is a hard ques-
tion to answer. But at least the facts
of the position can be rehearsed fairly
simply.
The U.S. possesses just short of
$13,000 million in gold reserves
those bricks and bars that were lovingly
displayed by the television cameras the
other night to Mr. and Mrs. America.
Against this, the dollar claims of
foreign governments and the central
banks amount to $14,000 million, while
a further $14,000 million is held by
foreign private banks and businesses.
Technically, therefore, the possibility
of the dollar being knocked off its pre-
sent parity with gold plainly exists, if
only because even Fort Knox could not
meet all those claims coming in at once.
That is not, however, a possibility that
as yet is causing any obvious panic or
alarm.
A large part of the explanation for
this clearly lies in the strong conviction
held both outside and'inside the Admin-
istration that the central banks share
with the U.S. a common interest in
maintaining international financial
stability.
Beyond assurances of support, there is
reason to believe, too, that the U.S.
Government has started discreetly to put
it about that gold-hoarding speculators
should not be too confident of making
a coup even if the dollars were finally
forced to the wall.
Some representatives of sympathetic
foreign banks in Washington state
openly that even in the event of a
showdown the U.S. has other alterna-
tives besides raising her price of gold.
Probably the most dramatic of the
re’medies suggested came yesterday from
Congressman Henry Reuss of Wiscon-
sin. He dared to propose that the U.S.
should simply choose to go off the gold
standard altogether, thus leaving the
speculators “holding the bag” and a
glut of gold available at $6 an ounce
for art work and tooth-fillings.
On a less revolutionary level, no t one
doubts that the Administration has a
number of lines of defence open to it
in what is essentially a war of nerves.
It could, for example, restrict American
investment in Western Europe, some-
thing President Kennedy during the
economic difficulties of 1961-62 is
always said to have hoped General de
Gaulle would do for him.
It could also, simply by a decision
of the Federal Reserve Board, remove
the limitation that now immobilises
$lO,OOO million of its gold reserves by
requiring that they be held as a cover
against domestic banknotes. '
For the moment, however, no official
is prepared to talk on the record about
any of these things. The U.S. Govern-
ment has plainly decided that its
proper stance should be one of majestic
calm. Even against what is admitted
in private to be the most serious threat
to dollar stability since 1931 it is doing
its best to maintain it.
Britain’s defence
The fading grin
THERE IS a growing belief that the
£stg. 100 million defence cuts made by
British Minister of Defence, Denis
Healey, last week, following on devalu-
ation, are only a beginning. Not unex-
pected is an accelerated withdrawal of
British forces East of Suez and a
further sharp reduction of the military
“capability” which Britain has prom-
ised to retain there afterwards the
grin, as it were, without the Cheshire
cat.
The latest cuts will yield little
more than a saving of between £25
million and £3O million. This is be-
cause of cancellation payments on


“Now I’ve restored your confidence follow me.”
United States helicopters and British
Buccaneer bombers, and the £6O mil-
lion extra which will have to be spent,
because of devaluation itself, on Ameri-
can aircraft, Polaris equipment, and
the stationing of forces overseas.
The British defence staff is uncom-
fortably aware that a genuine £lOO
million saving could be produced only
by slashing the defence budget still
further. What further worries the
British Services chiefs is Mr. Healey’s
admission that in writing-off the
carrier Victorious, dropping the plan to
build a £2O-million airfield on Aldabra
Island, in the Indian Ocean, and run-
ning down stocks, he was banking on
no serious threat arising either East or
West of Suez in the next two years.
The British Government’s most strik-
ing inconsistency has been about
Aldabra. Earlier this year it was tell-
ing the Royal Society that -only the
gravest necessity inspired its scheme to
construct an installation that would
irrevocably damage the island’s rare
ecology.
But last week Mr. Healey told the
Press that the requirement for Aldabra
had only been “marginal,” anyway.
In fact, a transit station on Aldabra
was probably vital to any scheme to
deploy British forces in the Indian
Ocean after Britain leaves the Persian
Gulf, because the present air route
across Turkey and Iran cannot be
relied on indefinitely.
The only other politically secure
route for deployments East of Suez,
apart from via Ascension Island, in the
Atlantic, and Alda'bra, is across North
America. But after devaluation the
dollar costs, both in transit charges
and aircraft requirement, will be bigger
than ever.
Accepting things as they are, Britain
may declare at once that she can no
longer afford any military commitment
in the Far or Middle East, that in
future her role will be to support inter-
national peace-keeping actions. Britain
may have to admit her inability to
continue any commitment to SEATO,
and warn Malaysia and Singapore that
she really is on her way out.
Given such a change in policy, real
savings instead of candle-end econo-
mies will become possible. The order
for American Fill aircraft, placed
particularly for long-range operations
East of Suez, should be cancelled. This
will lose Britain offset dollar orders,
but the long-term gain will more than
justify any such loss. The Fill’s
tactical strike role in Europe could be
taken over temporarily by low-level
Vulcans and, in the mid-19705, by a
European strike aircraft jointly devel-
oped with the Germans. This would
save Britain about £3O million a year
over ten years.
But the biggest logical saving for
Britain is in service manpower, which
in any economic expansion will be
needed in industry. Cuts currently
planned should be doubled, reducing
the present 472,000 servicemen to
350,000 in 1971, and 270,000 by 1975.
The civilians in defence employment
(360,000) should be cut in equal pro-
portion. This would save £l2O million
a year, in addition to the savings
already envisaged in the 1967 supple-
mentary White Paper. These cuts would
still allow Britain to maintain its cur-
rent forces in Germany, the essential
proof of its sincerity toward Europe,
and to maintain adequate standards of
military efficiency.
Very considerable savings are
possible in another field as well. Efforts
in aerospace should be directed to
projects that are within Britain’s means,
workable, and socially desirable. The
Concorde airliner should be scrapped
now, when only £9O million has been
spent (on the British side) out of an
estimated total of £250-£3OO million.
It is already acknowledged that the
Concorde will not repay its investment
costs: and dollar sales will be drastic-
ally cut if it is banned from supersonic
flying overland.
Cambodia
Border-hopping
From MARK FRANKLAND in Phnom Penh
THE DISCOVERY of what is
alleged to be a North Vietnamese
military camp within Cambodian terri-
tory by American news agency repor-
ters has dramatised how difficult it is
for Cambodia to keep clear of the
whirlpool of the Vietnam war.
The existence of Viet Cong and
North Vietnamese “sanctuaries” has
long been discussed unofficially
in Saigon. The American authorities
have, however, been shy of any public
talk about it until late this summer.
Then, in September, Admiral U.S.
Grant, American commander-in-chief
in the Pacific, told the Senate prepared-
ness investigating committee: “We have
known for quite a long time that there
are various regiments that operate back
and forth in South Vietnam, and back
into Cambodia when the heat is on
them. They use Cambodia as a sanc-
tuary.”
In May Major-General Stanley
Larson, then commander of American
forces in the central area of South
Vietnam, had claimed at a Press con-
ference that up to 10,000 North Viet-
namese and Viet Cong troops were
over the border in Cambodia. But the
Pentagon swiftly denied this.
The camp discovered by the Ameri-
cans, who had taken up an invitation
by the Cambodian head of state, Prince
Sihanouk, to inspect any border areas
they liked, was only a few miles from
the South Vietnamese town of Loc
Ninh.
People may find it hard to believe
that Prince Sihanouk should know
A wooden platform used by Viet Cong to
save rice from spoiling on the jungle floor
in a Viet Cong camp inside Cambodia.
The camp was discovered last week by-
Americans, taking up the invitation of Prince
Sihanouk of Cambodia to inspect any border
area they liked


Cambodian soldiers stand near wooden signs near a road which runs to a care-
fully concealed Viet Cong camp inside Cambodia. The signs say the area is
a Cambodian forest preserve
nothing of the existence of 10,000 or
even 5000 foreign guerillas on his ter-
ritory, but it is not quite as simple as
that.
The Cambodian-Vietnamese front-
tier is some 500 miles long. The Cam-
bodians “defend” it by scattered police
and militia outposts, usually placed
where a road, track, or river crosses the
border. The militia, who are nothing
more than peasants from villages near
the border, are supposed to carry out
patrols, perhaps two or three times a
day, along their sector of the border.
But at the frontier post of Bosmon, in
Svay Rieng province, where you can
see the famous Black Virgin mountain
rising like a volcano above the Viet-
namese town of Tay Ninh, a policeman
said that whenever there was a lot of
fighting on the other side the local
militia usually took up a defensive
position around their village. This is
a sensible act of defence by the peasant
militiamen for their cottages and
families, but obviously it leaves the
border open to anyone who might want
to escape across it.
In fact, this southern part of the
frontier between South Vietnam and
Cambodia has long been smugglers’
country.
At Bavet, the point where the old
French Route Nationale 1, linking
Phnom Penh and Saigon, crosses the
frontier, Vietnamese girls have a little
stall selling loot from the American
PX store. They stand on the Cam-
bodian side of the two barbed-wire-
covered hurdles that close the road and
offer Black and White Whisky and
Hennessy Brandy at two-thirds Phnom
Penh prices.
Smuggling across this border be-
came so bad recently that Prince
Sihanouk had to step in to check it.
He had just set up a factory for
bottling orange juice and found that
too many of the available Cambodian
oranges were being illegally shipped
across the border to South Vietnam.
Even more serious was the amount of
rice perhaps as much as 60,000 tons
last year - being bought illicitly by
the Viet Cong.
The rice was sold by the Cambodian
peasants to their usual Chinese middle-
men and passed through Chinese hands
to storage dumps holding up to 3000
tons on the Cambodian side of the
border. It was collected at night by
the Viet Cong, who signed a chit for
what they took. This passed back to
the chief Chinese organiser, who even-
tually cashed it in at the Chinese
Embassy in Phnom Penh.
This spring, Sihanouk managed to
break up the system, but that it ever
existed on such a scale is evidence
enough of the condition of these bor-
ders. Farther to the north, the situa-
tion is rather different. Here the terrain
on both sides of the frontier is diffi-
cult and very lightly populated. The
only way for the Cambodians to check
the hills and forests of these border
provinces would be to mount regular
and large-scale reconnaissance opera-
tions, and this they do not do. It is
partly a question of equipment. Cam-
bodia has only some half-dozen French
Alouette helicopters and is equally
badly equipped with the sort of vehicles
that can move about such difficult
country. Any attempt to send troops
footslogging through the jungles would
quickly eat up the 34,000-strong Royal
Cambodian Army.
Officials in these areas, including
some soldiers, show a marked reluc-
tance to, make unnecessary journeys,
and considering the hazards involved
this is not surprising. In Stung Treng
province, just below the border with
Laos, a Cambodian battalion occupies
the village of Siem Pang. The village
has won some fame as a cross-over
point on the Viet Cong’s so-called
Sihanouk Trail.
If Prince Sihanouk has no good way
of finding out what is happening along
his borders, the Americans certainly
do. It can have been only from U.S.
military intelligence that the Ameri-
can correspondents indirectly learned
of the camp’s location. But the infor-
mation is mostly of only academic in-
terest to the U.S. commanders as long
as they are not allowed to carry the
war into Cambodian territory.
Suez Canal
Will it ever
reopen?
QUIET FLOWS the canal, quieter
perhaps than any other waterway in
the world, and the Egyptian Govern-
ment seems fatalistically resigned to
this state of affairs. An occasional shell
may lob overhead, enemy aircraft may
“penetrate our air space,” but water
laps indolently over the sandy bed of
the Suez Canal as it silts up at the
rate of more than a foot a year.
For the present, Egypt is not suf-
fering unduly from the canal’s closure.
Canal tolls, plus subsidiary trade, were
reckoned in 1966 at $U.5.308 million.
The actual tolls for the year that
ended on June 30, 1967, had been
estimated at $U.5.250 million. This
estimate guided the agreement
at the Arab summit meeting in August
when Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Libya
agreed to pay £stg9s million a year
(or $U.5.266 million at the old rate
of exchange) to Egypt in lieu of lost
tolls. Of this total Kuwait was to pay
roughly £39 million, Saudi Arabia
£34 million, and Libya £22 million.
And, so far at least, the payments are
coming through on time.
Egypt still has to carry the loss of its-
subsidiary canal zone earnings, includ-
ing the loss of tourist traffic. It also has
a largely unemployed labor force
which used to work for the Suez Canal
Authority, and it has had the additional
cost of having to evacuate most of this
force to the Nile delta because of the
insecurity of the zone. Canal pilots are
being encouraged to take paid leave for
several years ahead, and this applies
also to many senior officials in the
Canal Authority.
The political outlook for the canal
is almost total gloom. But the canal
authorities still hopefully believe that
if and when the canal is reopened the

former toll receipts can be maintained
and even improved. Before the June
war, pilots were taking ships of 38 feet
draught through the canal. According
to the timetable of the “Nasser Project”
for deepening the canal, it should have
been taking ships of 39 feet draught; in
fact, it was not. Silting is putting this
back by years. The pre-war scheme en-
visaged that by 1973 the canal would
have been deepened to take ships with
48 feet draught; this means that ships
of 100,000 tons deadweight could get
through fully laden, and that tankers
going south in ballast could be accepted
up to 180,000 tons deadweight. The oil
companies had been hoping to get
through even larger tankers, up to
240,000 tons, on their return journey.
If any of this is ever to come about,
Egypt will somehow have to raise an
enormous amount of foreign invest-
ment. And even before the June war,
Egypt was no great draw to foreign
investors. The Suez Canal Authority
had made several forages into Europe
looking for capital, but with no suc-
cess. Major users of the canal think
that only an international consortium,
such as that which rescued Iran from
the wreck of oil nationalisation, could
provide the capital to modernise the
canal. But any suggestion that the
canal would no longer be solely
Egypt’s, even if the shadows of im-
perialism could go unseen, would need
a major change of heart in Cairo. So
there is more reason than one why
the canal’s future is uncertain. But for
the time being those Israeli troops in
Sinai are reason enough.
Thailand
Change of heart
BEHIND THE FACADE of gentle
smiles, charm, and politeness which
generally characterise U.S.-Thai rela-
tions, many experts have begun to see
a subtle almost imperceptible
change of mood. This sometimes bor-
ders on visible irritation on matters
which touch on the national psychol-
ogy of the Thais but vhich, in political
terms, are of little importance. The
most significant fact is that the num-
ber of occasions when Thais get visibly
upset or irritated by American policies
or behaviour (and vice versa) is in-
creasing rather rapidly.
“Newsweek’s” article on the North-
east caused a storm here not so much
because it painted a grim picture of
the increasing insurgency in parts of
Thailand as because of some uncharit-
able references to the King of Thai-
land. (It contained a thinly veiled hint
that the King was afraid to get out of
his helicopter when he recently visited
a terrorist infested area.) Two top
Cabinet Ministers, Premier Thanom
Kittikachorn and Interior Minister and
Deputy Premier Prapass Charusthira,

King of Thailand... references
hit out at “Newsweek” with a warn-
ing that the Government might take
action against the magazine.
The growing irritation leaders in
Thailand feel toward a section of the
U.S. Press is partly due to continued
uncertainty in Thailand about the
changing mood in the U.S. toward the
Vietnam war. They are also worried
at the opposition in the U.S. Senate
to Thai-U.S. collaboration. The declin-
ing popularity of President Johnson
and the recurrent talk about differences
of opinion inside the U.S. administra-
tion about the conduct of war in Viet-
nam also create alarm. The Thais who
see every issue connected with Vietnam
or Communism in black and white are
plainly bewildered by these trends in
American politics and are convinced
that powerful forces are at work within
the U.S. to destroy the ideals that
Thailand and the U.S. supposedly be-
lieve in.
The alliance between Thailand and
the U.S. has never been anything more
than a pure “governmental arrange-
ment” unlike, say, the Indo-Soviet
understanding or even Indo-U.S. rela-
tions which become part of national
consciousness of the countries involved.
Now, Thai leaders suspect and the
suspicion is not without some sub-
stance this “governmental arrange-
ment” is slowly being undermined by
various forces, including a section of
the U.S. Press. This explains why dur-
ing his recent visit to the U.S. the
Thai Foreign Minister was so unneces-
sarily aggressive every time he had an
opportunity of talking to the Press and
made no attempt to understand the
anti-Vietnam war feeling now sweep-
ing the U.S.
This growing hostility between Thai-
land and the U.S. Press was not so
obvious even two years ago when the
most influential U.S. newspapers and
magazines regarded Thailand as a
“showpiece of economic progress” and
as a country which then seemed fully
capable of dealing with the insurgency
in the Northeast with a little bit of
U.S. help. The continuing frustration
over Vietnam was then counter-
balanced by increasing optimism about
Thailand.
“This little bit of help” has now
turned out to be aid on a massive
scale. The country that two years
ago appeared capable of dealing with its
own insurgency problem seems caught
in a situation which reminds some
American correspondents of Vietnam in
the 19505. The optimism about “this
showpiece of economic progress” is
suddenly disappearing in the hazy mist
of steadily growing frustration. The
dispatches written by American cor-,
respondents either visiting or stationed
in Thailand now continually report on
this drift in Thailand. These dispatches
raise queries which were never raised
before and they report facts which were
never reported before.
The Thai leaders’ displeasure at
this kind of reporting becomes all the
more obvious and understandable
when American newsmen tend to give
the impression that, since their coun-
try is providing so much of direct aid
in fighting the insurgency in the North-
east, they have a right to come out
openly in criticising the failure of the
local government. American outspoken-
ness and Thai sensitivity have come at
last into open conflict.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
More signs of a rapid
turn into boom
THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN and
the flurry over devaluation have
obscured a number of clear indications
that the economy is rapidly going into
a period of unprecedented boom. The
Bulletin, almost alone, reported last
week that the employment statistics for
the end of October showed a remark-
able tightening of the labor market.
This week yielded further indications of
a vigorous acceleration of economic
activity. October housing approvals
are at a record level, equivalent to an
annual figure of 131,000. Bearing in
mind that it is hardly a year since the
figure was only just making the 100,000
mark, the volume of housing work com-
ing up is increasing at a phenomenal
rate.
An incidental phenomenon, we
might interject, has been the inability
of the Government to exploit the in-
dications of this sort of prosperity in
its Senate election campaign. Any-
way, getting away from politics and
back to facts, the housing industry will
soon be fully stretched in all States
Irrigation at Emerald... dubious?
except South Australia, which is still
the sick region. The value of other
building approvals is not nearly so
spectacular as that of housing. But it
is quite healthy, ticking over at about
$BO million a month. Considering the
fact that six months ago it appeared
and every commentator including the
Treasury men predicted it that there
would be an absolute fall in non-
housing construction, the fact that it
has been sustained at previous levels
is encouraging.
Which makes sillier than ever the
Government’s Senate election handouts
of money for two dubious irrigation
propects. The economic situation is
shaping up in a way which obliges the
Government to look very critically at
all public-works proposals.
Shipping
Higher freights
IT IS JUST TOO BAD, but nothing
can be done about last week’s 12J per-
cent freight-rate rise (in sterling cur-
rency terms), on the Europe-Australia
run and the inevitable similar rise that
will follow in a couple of weeks on the
Australia-Europe return trip. For this
rise is one of the consequences of
British shipping lines on this run hav-
ing joined in a price-fixing shipping
conference with European ship
owners. The British lines could have
come out of the devaluation business
all square if they had raised the ster-
ling cost of their freight rates by about
5 percent to take account of the higher
costs of servicing their ships in foreign
ports now that sterling is worth 14.3
percent less. For something like one-
third of the cost of running a ship on
the Australia-Britain route is spent in
Australia. Such a rise would have
meant only a small increase in freight
charges for British exporters and
a 10 percent or so fall for Australian
exporters in dollar terms. But the
European members of the conference,
who make up probably 40 percent of
its membership (and whose proportion
is steadily rising), were in a far dif-
ferent position from their British col-
leagues. For, apart from Denmark, all
the European countries with ships on
this run did not devalue. And as
their only link with sterling is that
shippers pay their bills in it, these
Continentals stood to gain nothing in
terms of lower costs from the devalua-
tion at all (apart from lower handling
charges if they happened to call at
British ports). So they naturally did
not want their income to be reduced
by the sterling devaluation (they say it
would require a 16.7 percent rise in
freight rates in sterling currency to
make up for the 14.3 percent devalua-
tion). In agreeing on a 12J percent
rise, the Continentals are in effect
lowering their charges by 4 percent
without getting offsetting lower costs.
But this is still better for them than
the threat that the British members
could have walked out of the confer-
ence and under-cut the Continentals on
this run because of their reduced oper-
ating costs.
Nevertheless, it is unfortunate for
British exporters, who now find some
of the devaluation advantages whittled
away by this freight-rate rise, that
British shipping companies did not
stand on their own. If the British
lines had gone it alone and had been
able to snatch a bit of the business
now carried by the Continentals by
under-cutting them (in addition to
giving British exporters the benefit of
lower rates) it would certainly have
been in Britain’s best interests and
would have been just the sort of thing
that a devaluation is supposed to en-
courage earners of foreign exchange to
do. But the British shipping companies
appear to prefer the cosiness of the
conference to the uncomfortable com-
petitive state that would help lift their
country out of the mire.
The economy
A gloomy survey
OUR FRIENDS IN THE research
department of the ANZ Bank really
are in a gloomy mood, possibly reflect-
ing the bank’s sadness at seeing its
London credits reduced by sterling’s
devaluation. Their latest monthly sur-
vey of the economy is a document full
of misery. The funny thing is that their
statistics and graphs are enough to
warm the heart of the most pessimistic
of souls. For instance, their index of
factory production for the latest month
shows a healthy two percent rise over
the figure for the previous month
an annual rate of increase of 20 per-
cent. And their little graph suggests
that the rise in factory production

between October, 1966, and about
April this year was faster than for any
corresponding period of time since the
recovery from the deep recession of
1961. And they speak of a “relatively
slow expansion in retail sales,” having
given the figure of 7.6 percent per
annum.
Their whole outlook seems to be
conditioned by the sad prospects for
farmers in eastern S.A. and western
Victoria. They’ve evidently been out
too much in the drought (and sun),
for the fact is that these days the Aus-
tralian economy has an industrial
momentum which enables it to carry
on without being severely affected by
the fluctuating fortunes of the rural
sector.
Sterling
The last to know
AUSTRALIA, THE COUNTRY with
the most to lose in sterling reserves, was
the last to know that Britain was going
to devalue.
There is mounting evidence that all
Britain’s major financial associates
except Australia knew Britain was con-
sidering devaluing the weekend before
she finally did so, and that their reac-
tions were sought by Britain to the
prospect. Australia’s opinions were not
sought. According to reports in Lon-
don, Britain explored reactions to a
possible devaluation without mention-
ing a rate at. the meeting of central
bunkers at Basle the weekend before
devaluation. The countries split into
three groups:
1. Those who thought devaluation
was appropriate and the sooner the
better;
2. Those who considered devaluation
a sensible move but thought a short-
term loan should be taken until the
time was more appropriate, which
roughly meant when the level of unem-
ployment in France and Germany had
started to fall; and
3. Those who were against devalua-
tion and favored a further package of
credit and deflationary measures.
The third choice would have involved
borrowing 3000 million dollars (£1250
million) from the International Mone-
tary Fund. A borrowing on this scale
would have been unprecedented, and
the fund’s governor, Pierre-Paul
Schweitzer, was initially horrified when
the suggestion was put to him with-
out Britain’s knowledge. His view was
that the conditions attached to such a
loan would have to be fantastic. When
he sounded the views of his staff, they
pointed out that such conditions would
make a loan of that size totally imprac-
tical and within two hours Schweitzer
had informed the central bankers that
such a loan was not on.
But his initial hesitation had been
long enough for the French to start
working on the rumors of a loan with
massive strings attached; rumors that
received prominence in the British
Press and which played some part in
the devaluation crisis.
Throughout the following week in
Paris two parallel attempts to sort out
the pound’s, problems were under way.
From the start it was clear that the
Americans were deeply perturbed by
the idea of the pound being devalued.
The British had not given any hint
about the rate they had in mind and
America came to believe the worst
either a 30 percent devaluation or
possibly a move to a floating rate where
the value of the pound would be de-
termined by supply and demand in the
foreign-exchange market.
With Britain’s knowledge, the Ameri-
can delegation in Paris began to talk
to a number of other central bankers,
in the hope of producing a central
bank package that would provide credit
for a year — ; longer than the normal
central bank period. The Americans got
a long way with this idea and had some
firm commitments to it, but in the
end the devaluation horse, to which
the British were by then committed,
anyw r ay, quite apart from allegations
of French wickedness, beat the Ameri-
cans to the post by a short head. And
it is the American dollar that is now
bearing the brunt of speculative moves.
British economy
Chances of success
IF BRITAIN FAILS to make the most
of the magnificent opportunity given by
devaluation, the outlook for the
economy and for its political and
social structure is gloomy, says the
economist Alan Day. Given the right
lead and the right measures of control
by the Government, there is no reason
why it should not use the openings
successfully. The new opportunities are
excellent. Prices of imported goods will
rise about 10 percent in relation to
their home-produced competitors; and
exporters can either cut their foreign
currency prices by about 10 percent
(after allowing for all cost increases) or
increase their profit margins by 10 per-
cent of their selling prices.
There is, however, a real risk that
devaluation will be taken not as an
opportunity to get the economy into a
prosperous and stable state but simply
to make sure that Mr. Wilson is still
Prime Minister in the early 19705.
The official view is that the impact
of devaluation on the cost of living
will be 21-3 percent: this seems to
be a little high since many food im-
port prices should not rise significantly.
On the other hand, there are other
inflationary elements in the system,
irrespective of devaluation, so, in total,
prices will rise a good deal more than
3 percent.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: The Federal Government did not
devalue the Australian dollar following devaluation of the
British pound (by 14.3 percent); Australia’s largest market
for manufactures, New Zealand, brought its dollar to parity
with the Australian dollar by a 19.45 percent devaluation.
The three months ended October saw significant increases
in the production of motor vehicles and consumer goods
(especially refrigerators and washing machines); iron and
steel output was also up.
Outstandings on hire purchase and instalment credit
totalled $ll4B million at the end of October.
British and European shipping conference lines are
attempting to obtain a 12J percent lift in freight rates on
exports from Australia.
For the markets: After a very positive recovery
from devaluation shocks, Australian share markets grew un-
settled again at the end. Miners and oils hold well, with
golds heavily sought; banks, pastorals, and sugars look most
disturbed. Short-term bond yields have added about .5 per-
cent.
Golds continue to be heavily sought in London; equities
are in decline, although some leaders appear better . . .
Wall Street also traded strongly in golds, but glamor
industrials led an overall retreat.
For companies : There were several prominent reassur-
ances on possible damage from the British and New Zealand
devaluations . . . Henry Jones (IXL) expects no ill effects
(funds for apple and pear sales were remitted before devalua-
tion) and group profits for the year to September will
“definitely be greater” . . . Proceeds from the 1967 sugar
season have been protected by CSR with forward contracts;
future effects may be cushioned if the London daily price
goes up to New York levels . . . Australian Paper Manufac-
turers believes there will be no imports competition from
Zealand in paper ancf boards . . . Forward commitments
on sterling purchases have been covered by Bradford Cotton,
which added that its N.Z. exports weren’t significant . . .
Felt and Textiles’ larger Australian earnings should offset
a reduction in N.Z.
Following in the path of other Australian trading banks,
the ANZ sent earnings up by 22-|- percent to $7,425,000 and
held 12 percent, seven percent of which is payable in
devalued currency . . . Life assurer and general insurer
United Holdings moved from $112,914 to $212,359, keeping
10 percent on issue-increased capital . . . One of the giants,
National Mutual Life, wrote new policies assuring $736.1
million (previously $668.6 million) in 1966-67; new premium
income rose by 9.6 percent (12.7 percent).
More negotiations for exploration deals in the Kambalda
(W.A.) area are being conducted by Hampton Gold Mining
Areas . . . E.Z. Industries’ subsidiary Electrolytic Zinc has
made a rich lead-zinc find at Beltana (S.A.) . . . Production
of blister copper from Mount Isa still remains well below
last year’s levels . . . Magellan Petroleum proposes a l-for-5
issue of 50 cent shares at 100 percent premium to raise
$1,651,400 . . . Mineral Securities is to float Petroleum
Securities to secure a “worthwhile interest” in the oil and
gas industry.
A second-half improvement and absolutely no tax enabled
Ampol Petroleum to send profit up by 33.8 percent to
$6,750,154; a 10 percent payment is retained . . . Sydney
GM-H dealer John A. Gilbert Holdings earned $152,448 in
six months to September, nearly double the previous corres-
ponding period.
Paintmaker Taubmans slipped from $983,000 to $947,000
after making a provision for N.Z.’s devaluation . . . The
Herald and Weekly Times earned 13 percent more at
$5,561,027, but returns from its Melbourne newspapers were
lower.
MEN AND MATTERS
MELBOURNE GRAMMAR may be
the right school to go to if you want
to become a Melbourne stockbroker, but
Shore is the place in Sydney. Last
week 53-year-old Mr. James H. Cooper,
who left Shore in 1932, took over the
chair of the Sydney Stock Exchange
from one-year incumbent Ken Polking-
horne (a former Kings man who had
followed the six-year term of Shore’s
A. H. Urquhart).
Jim Cooper’s 10-man committee in-
cludes four Shore men, one of whom,'
Ken Rothwell, is second in line for
the chairman’s job following his ap-
pointment as honorary treasurer. The
others are Bill Tilley and John Watson.
Shore’s high proportion on the com-
mittee reflects pretty well its prepond-
erance among members. But other
“good schools” are also well represented.
Sydney Grammar has two old boys on
the committee, vice-chairman David
North and Keith Phillips, and so has
Cranbrook, which claims the represent-
atives of the “big firms” —Charles Ord,
of Ord Minriett, etc., and M. R. L.
(Ric) Dowling; of Patricks.
The remaining two are Newington’s
A. B. Challice and, surprise, surprise,
an old boy of Newcastle High School,
lan Reid, the committee-newcomer and
its only sole trader who is showing what
dreadful fellows these State school
chaps are by pulling off one of the
best market coups in years getting
the job of floating Australia’s third-
biggest rutile operator, Mineral De-
posits Ltd., next month.
Six of the committee have tertiary
qualifications, with two lawyers, two
accountants, and two economists (one
also having accountancy qualifications).
One thing all these committee mem-
bers have in common is that they are
ex-servicemen. The chairman was a
lieutenant in the N.S.W. Scottish Regi-
ment was captured by the Japanese
and put to work on the notorious
Burma railway; the vice-chairman was
an RAAF pilot in England and Italy.
Both the chairman and vice-chairman
are following a family tradition in
stockbroking: Jim Cooper now runs the
firm his late father, Herbert P. Cooper,
founded and which he joined on leav-
ing school; David North is one of eight
Norths who have been or are members
of the Sydney Stock Exchange and is
the third generation of Norths to serve
on the committee. (His father, the late
J. A. North, was vice-chairman 10 years
ago, and his great-uncle, A. H. North,
J. H. Cooper
A. H. Urquhart
was chairman from 1917 to 1919 and
vice-chairman four times.)
David North’s election as vice-
chairman celebrates the 100th anniver-
sary of his firm, J. and J. North, which
was founded by J. B. North, a member
of what was then known as the Brokers’
Association and which subsequently be-
came the Sydney Stock Exchange. The
latest North, now 44 and an energetic
cricketer, went into the firm after being
demobilised in 1945 and became an
authorised clerk (his grandfather, J. G.
North, from whom he subsequently
purchased his exchange seat two years
later, was the first clerk to be authorised
by the Sydney Exchange).

The high art of
By DAVID McGILL
“AUSTRALIAN PRODUCTIVITY is
about 25 years behind the U. 5.,” said
an American management consultant
on a visit to Australia earlier this year.
<£ The blame lies firmly with manage-
ment. The ordinary workman is not
to blame. He can only work with the
tools management provide for him.
There is lower production in Australia
because of a (different mental attitude.”
But is it all in the mind, this U.S. lead
in management techniques?
“The question I’m always being
asked,” says an American manager in
Switzerland, “is simply, ‘How do you
get things done?’ Somehow we’ve
created an amazing mystique about our
way of doing things. P think it’s be-
cause we’ve learned how to motivate
people better than anyone else.”
“The difference,” says the head of
an industrial economics section in
Geneva, “is that Americans know what
they want.” An American ’manager’ in
Brussels supports this: “The European
is much less sure. In Italy you get a lot
of the ‘possibiliste’ state of mind, a
•general unwillingness to look for some-
thing without any real conviction that
it’s there. We’re always convinced it’s
there, somewhere.” The American has
the added incentive of being fired if
he does not. find out what is wrong; in
European companies managers are safe
,for life unless they make a titanic
blunder.
The American manages dangerously.
“European managers make fewer mis-
takes than American managers,” says
an American management consultant,
“but the biggest mistake they make is
not making enough mistakes. They must
be willing to take more chances. Middle
management in Europe is extremely
weak and is prevented from taking
decisions and running the show.”
The result: Since 1958 annual sales
of U.S. subsidiaries in Europe have
soared from $7.6 billion to $19.3 bil-
lion. In the process they have out-
pointed, if not KO’d, their European
competitors. After eight years of the
Common Market, the most “European”
companies are American, the most-
copied management techniques are
American, and the fastest penetration
of the 'market continues to be Ameri-
can. So the days have gone when
Europeans looked down their noses at
Americans, those loud-mouthed Yankees
who come to Europe to buy culture.
Now quiet Americans come to Europe
to make money and rueful Europeans
go to the States to learn how to make
money. This is a phenomenon of the
1960 s and the success formula, has been
America’s new managerial revolution.
The Americans recognised the need
to study the art of business back in
1908, when the Harvard Business
School was founded on the pioneering
idea that business was a professional
matter worthy of the attention of
learned men. That was the age in
America of scientific management,
when efficiency was an end in itself
and the worker was considered a
machine rather than a human being.
Scientific management is still apparent
in the efforts of executives to minimise
cost at all costs, but its philosophical
basis was weakened when it was estab-
lished that the worker was a human
being and reacted most efficiently when
treated as such. The second half of
the 1930 s was spent guiltily trying to
keep the worker happy. Today, Ameri-
can managers retain ideas stretching
back to Adam Smith and John Cal-
vin, but more significant is their con-
stant search for new ideas.
Among the ideas for keeping mana-
gers on the ball is going back to uni-
versity for four-week crash courses
on the events that have a subtle in-
fluence on business, such as civil rights
demonstrations, urban conflict, inter-
national power politics. Some mana-
gers who have good potential but are
a bit rough in customer and community
contacts are being sent to charm
schools, where they learn the proper
stance for plucking the leaves of an
artichoke while keeping the conversa-
tion going. Popular at present are a
series of sophisticated monopoly games
that teach ways and means of running
a business. Games like “Adman,”
“Automation,” and “Negotiation,”
where players take turns moving round
the board like “Snakes and Ladders”
cards labelled “Labor Leader” or
“Management.” Each space on the
board presents a different problem and
the wrong decision means a loss of
points.
“Participative Management” is prob-
ably the most popular move at present
to liberalise management. The idea, is
that the company should operate like
a jazz combo, where everyone has a
say, rather than the conductor and
his orchestra. Many chief executives
are saying that the job at the top is
too much for one man to handle.
“There is a tendency,” says Joel Hun-
ter, president of Crucible Steel Com-
pany, “to include more than a single
man in the role of chief executive in
order to provide greater breadth. I
suspect that this will become more and
more popular in larger and more com-
plex companies.” At present there is a
proliferation in U.S. companies of
people with titles such as “Special
Assistant to the President” and “Execu-
tive Assistant,” and three or more vice-
presidencies are appearing where pre-
viously there was- one.
Across the corporate map the second
echelon of management is steadily
being strengthened, and executive com-
mittees are playing bigger roles. Ford
Motor Company has a three-man Chief
Executive, National Biscuit Company
its four-man Executive Department,
Itek Corporation its five-man Presi-
dent’s Office. The company fortunes
of mammoth U:S. Steel are managed
by a tfoika, Union Carbide’s by a
quadrumvirate. Giant General Motors,
for so long dominated by one man,
is now split three, if not four, ways.
Some companies have split themselves
like amoeba. Colorado Interstate Gas
is now in four divisions, each a separ-
Commander Whitehead... sell and promote
ate company with its own president,
but stfll under tight corporate financial
control.
Group management is so much under
discussion that the term “multiple chief
executive” has joined the glossary of
familiar boardroom phrases. Under
the relentless drive toward diversifica-
tion and the development of overseas
markets, where the problems of doing
business in Great Britain, Ghana, or
Guinea are so different from at home,
many are calling into question “the
superstition of the one-man chief.”
- Some European companies, mainly
Dutch and German, have also adopted
the hydra-headed corporation. Euro-
pean management has had the prece-
dent of the founding father usually
willing that his responsibilities be
divided ‘among his heirs, thus spread-
ing the authority, yet keeping it in
the family. When public corporations
were formed, their charters provided
for the traditional pattern of more
than one man at the top. Guiding the
' Royal Dutch/Shell Group is a seven-
man Committee of Managing. Direc-

tors, three Dutch, three British, one
American. Members share power
equally and decide among themselves
who will chair the meetings. Philips of
Holland has a collegium of 11 mem-
bers and Unilever NV, the Dutch
half of the diversified giant, boasts no
fewer than 23 men at the top.
When “Dun’s Review,” the Ameri-
can business journal, asked 300 top
U.S. executives earlier this year what
the business trends were, most
emphasised that decentralisation was
the wave of the future. Chairman W.
Cordes Snyder of Blaw-Knox Com-
pany sounded the keynote: “Corpora-
Alfred P. Sloan... a father figure
tions are becoming so large and their
business so complex that it is more
important than ever to decentralise into
smaller profit centers, but with overall
control.” President Robert G. Dunlop
of Sun Oil Co. saw “greater centralised
control of planning and more decen-
tralised execution of line functions.”
They saw the conventional triangular
corporate chart being replaced by a
flattened version that spreads respon-
sibility and authority more widely.
“The organisation,” said Herman H.
Scott, president of H. H. Scott Inc.,
“is becoming more like a truncated
pyramid with a trapesoidal cross-
section, with a number of vice-presi-
dents or assistants to the president.” An
executive vice-president of Firestone
believed that difficulties arose not from
diversity or corporate elephantiasis but
from ineffective planning. Many
stressed the need for an intuitive
approach, a preparedness to take risks,
the need, as one said, for “business
moxie.” They noted that almost every
major management task was being
aided by the computer, and felt the
chief executives’ problem here was how
to keep up with its chatter.
The crucial decision, which the com-
puter cannot finally make, is one of
value whether the customer wants
A or B. The valuation of a corpora-
tion’s securities is now judged on
quality of managers as much as inani-
mate assets. Investment on plant
modernising is felt to be wasted if there
is not also investment in managerial
talent, which includes physical and
social scientists, lawyers, and public
relations experts. Sears, Roebuck identi-
fies individuals with potential almost
as soon as they join and tries them
out with managerial challenges. Gen-
eral Electric allows each manager to
choose his own line of development.
Concern now is not only with the best
man for the job, but also with the
best job for the man. Companies are
allowing trainees to make costly mis-
takes because so many are quitting
after a year with the reason that the
job is “not demanding enough.”
But at least U.S. corporations are
attracting young graduates into the
business life. Most Australian companies
don’t really know what to do with
young graduates (they are never fully
extended), so they go instead into uni-
versity teaching, the government, or
overseas. Most of Australia’s home-
built industries are run by self-styled
practical men, who took over control
before the advent of sophisticated man-
agement techniques. Indicative of the
success of their traditional techniques
is the rate at which Australian com-
panies have been picked off by over-
seas organisations' in the past decade.
The managers did the picking. The
success of a business no longer depends
on the efficiency of manual workers;
in the competitive present it depends
on the ideas of the knowledge workers.
The huge drives most U.S. companies
now make to recruit graduates before
they are off the campus is part of the
present “youthquake” in American
business. There is *l story of the firm
which filled an ’important executive
position through a consulting firm, and
then discovered that, they had hired
one of their own junior executives.
Among the firms who have acquired
presidents under 45 in the past year
are Lever Brothers, Eaton Yale and
Towne, Boston Edison, Grolier, Phil-
lips-Van Heusen, and Hamilton Watch.
Such companies as American Express,
Armco Steel, and Chase Manhattan
Bank have put men in their thirties and
forties in charge of overseas subsid-
iaries, where the growth rate is twice
that of the domestic.
The youth trend has now caught on
in West Germany, where the growth

rate in the 1950 s was much higher
than the States’. The old-line technical
men in their sixties are being replaced
by professional executives in their for-
ties. The Germans are calling it “the
second post-war wave of general mana-
gers”; the first wave was mainly pro-
duction men who had to meet the
huge demand. Now Europe is having
to cope with U.S.-style problems
salesmanship, greater efficiency, long-
range planning, and increased com-
petition.
The biographies of the new men
read like American success stories
jobless at the end of the war, worked
way through college on a pittance, took
low-level management job and did
post-graduate study at night, and rose
steadily through the ranks. Eberhard
von Brauchitsch is typical. He came
out of the war with no job and a
family to support. He became a
junior assistant in the Flick industrial
empire, and is now top manager. The
tottering Krupp empire is due to be
taken over by 47-year-old Gunter
Vogelsang, a financial expert with
broad managerial experience in other
Ruhr corporations. Volkswagen is cer-
tainly not tottering, but it will be taken
over by the youthful Kurt Lotz, who
has broad executive ability instead of
expert knowledge of the auto industry.
Most of these managers work 60 to
80 hours a week like their American
counterparts, live comfortably but not
luxuriously, and believe in physical fit-
ness. They keep a close watch on new
developments in American manage-
ment. Dr. Joachim Zahn, top man of
Daimler-Benz, was asked for his suc-
cess formula. He quoted large chunks
of “My Years with General Motors”
by Alfred P. Sloan, and concluded: “It
contains all one needs to know.”
Germany's managerial revolution not
only promises tough new competition
for American firms at home and
abroad, but also serves as an example
to other nations in need of a more
efficient industry such as Britain,
which is certainly not ticking over.
When Harold Wilson came to power
three years ago, Britain still seemed to
fit George Orwell’s description of “a
land of snobbery and privilege, ruled
largely by the old and the silly.” On the
boards of the five biggest banks were
82 peers, baronets, and knights. No
less than half the directors of London’s
top financial houses and insurance com-
panies were old school chums from
Eton. After innumerable lunches with
leaders of industry, Wilson is reputed
to have muttered with Yorkshire grit:
“Britannia must waive the rules.”
On cue the leaders of Britain’s blue-
chip companies joined in. “Too many
old men cling on long past their ability
to contribute anything,” said Cecil
King, chairman of the International
Publishing Corporation. “Too many

tives,” chorused Sir Leon Bagrit,
chairman of Elliott-Automation: “The
British economy is a little like Gulliver
in Lilliput, when he could not move
because of the hundreds of cords hold-
ing him back.”
“We must become a nation of sales-
men,” decided the Rt. Hon. Viscount
Watkinson of Schweppes Ltd. His
friend, the dashing, bearded Com-
mander Edward Whitehead, OBE,
president of Schweppes (U.S.A.), was
piped aboard as chairman of the British
Export Marketing Advisory Committee
(BEMAC) to put a little ginger into
his country’s sales efforts in the States.
Although corporate sanguinity colors
his appointment (his boss, the Viscount,
is chairman of BEMAC and David
Ogilvy, whose firm handles the
Schweppes account, is also a member),
nobody has criticised these “old boys”
relations. After all, Schweppes sales
have increased by more than 2000 per-
cent in the past decade. For a long
time Whitehead has been a voice in
the British wilderness; now he has the
job of persuading his countrymen that
it is not slightly disreputable to sell
and promote. As the Commander told
his own firm recently when they asked
politely but a little anxiously why he
had tossed overboard the 156-year-old
Schweppes bottle for a disposable,
throwaway container: “I’m proud of
it, but that is what the public wants.
If they want it in goatskin, then they’ll
get it in goatskin provided that it’s
hygienic, of course.
“Britain’s best brains,” he has said,
“have been channelled into the profes-
sions, the services, and civil service.
Even those with a family connection in
industry try to get out of it.” His
plan is to win over some of England’s
“best young men” to industry, then
bring them to the United States to
learn up-to-date marketing techniques.
Of the dyed-in-the-wool senior chair-
man of the respectable British com-
pany, he says: “I despair of doing much
with him.”
Relying on one man to save the
ship is the fashion in Britain. Lord
Beeching, who made his name chopping
the British Railways down to economic
size, Lord Robens, Joe Hyman, Arnold
Weinstock, Sir Frank Kearton, Sir
Donald Stokes these are some of
the small group of business leaders
very much in demand. British com-
panies, whether oil, chemical, transport,
engineering, textiles, or whatever, bar-
gain for and often gain only a part-
share of them. These supermen are
extremely valuable at present, but
Britain has also recognised the need
for a lot more managers. “The chief
problem of the economy has been the
slow growth of productivity, traceable
to failures of management,” says Dr.
Arthur F. Earle, principal of the Lon-
don Business School, one of two insti-
tutions recently established to bridge
Britain’s managerial gap.
In the past two years Russia has been
obliged to join the managerial revolu-
tion. The U.S.S.R. is, of course, the

biggest and most diversified corpora-
tion in the world. Its problem is simi-
lar to that faced by Alfred Sloan and
General Motors in the early 1920 s
the managers at the centre have been
trying to discharge too much responsi-
bility and have vitiated their control of
the far-flung complex. Russian planners
now have to grasp the nettle of decen-
tralisation. Mr. Kosygin gave the go-
ahead in 1964 and was promptly de-
nounced by the Chinese for copying
“the experience of the Tito clique.”
The reforms remove gross-product tar-
gets and oblige plants to meet cus-
tomers’ orders and at a profit.
Plant managers can now distribute in-
centives. Out the window goes the
quota system, whereby the largest pos-
sible nails or shoes which were all the
same size were produced in the inter-
ests of quality and speed. The quantity-
conscious managers are being turned
into quality-conscious innovators. The
Russians, anxious to catch up, are
studying U.S. management techniques
and hiring American experts.
One of the good effects of the
American way of business is its inter-
nationalising influence. Nations are
being forced to learn how to deal with
each other. It did not take U.S. busi-
nessmen long to lose their “Ugly
American” image when they found that
it interfered with productivity. A
striking example of business before
nationalism is the non-profit Inter-
national Executive Training Centre,
whose first class of 17 high-level mana-
gers (average age 42, coming from 14
corporations in 10 different counties)
graduated last April. Among them were
Fiat’s man in Cairo, the Chrysler In-
ternational Controller, the assistant to
the president of Spain’s Barreiros
Diesel, officials from France’s Credit
Lyonnais, Britain’s Rolls-Royce, U.S.’s
IBM and Sweden’s Saab. The school
was the idea of Georges Heriel, who,
as president of Sud Aviation found it
difficult to sell abroad the Caravelle
jet and the Alouette helicopter. Both
were very much in demand, but he
could find no aides who could deal
successfully with people from other
countries.
During the 10-week course French
and Amei'ican instructors delved into
everything from the unity of man to
the technology gap and international
monetary liquidity. Among the business-
bigwigs who lectured were men from
Volkswagen and Renault, who ex-
plained why their companies have res-
pectively succeeded and failed in the
United States. The graduates were
full of praise for the course. West
German banker Dietrich Herzog said:
“What I have learned here is that
European integration is not only pos-
sible but absolutely necessary. Of all
Europeans, the French need this sort
of exposure most.” That is what Heriel
is after: “We want to make business
more human.”

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
Devaluation, and
the Exchanges
shilly-shallied
TO D OR NOT TO D, that was the
question facing the Government at
the beginning of last week. And this
time the decision was not to go all the
way; it was, in fact, to go none of the
way. The Australian dollar was not
devalued by one iota of a percent. The
reaction generally was favorable. Most
Australians seemed happy that the Gov-
ernment considered we were strong
enough to stand on our own two feet,
economically, anyway. Such breast-
beating phrases as “the Australian dol-
lar is a currency in its own right” are
common fare around town at «the
moment.
The only factor that seemed to dis-
tress people about the whole affair was
the way the Stock Exchanges behaved
in their moment of “crisis.” Instead of
grabbing the opportunity of exhibiting
a strong, united, and confident front to
the public, all they did was hold con-
ferences, sit on the fence and look
confused. They couldn’t even decide
unanimously whether to stay open or
closed. In the end Melbourne opened,
while all the others spent the day
procrastinating. It seems to me that
the Stock Exchanges’ role in the com-
munity is to provide a public market
place for interested parties and that
the decision as to whether or not the
facility is used is one that rests entirely
with the individual investor. It doesn’t
seem reasonable to me that the Stock
Exchanges should make a decision that
prevents a, trader from operating when
he so desires.
Having got that off my chest, on
with the buying and selling.
My number one and only buy this
week was Bonds Industries, a company
that does consistently well in a very
tricky industry. Besides sponsoring
Chesty Bond comics and rather good
commercials for Dri-Glo towels, the
company is also an excellent bread-
winner and sharer. Since the beginning
of the ’sixties it has showered its share-
holders with two cash issues and one
bonus issue. But still the market is
nervous, probably more about the in-
dustry than the company, and is cur-
rently valuing the shares at only eight
times last year’s earnings. At this
level they look a good medium-term
buy and to a speculator that means a
couple of months. Last year alone, the
profit rose by over 32 percent to a
record $1.5 million, which represented
a return of 35.9 percent on capital.
Also, the dividend payout, which had
only just been raised from 10 percent
to 12 percent in 1965/66, was again
increased in 1966/67 to 14 percent. And
even at 14 percent it’s still covered
one and a half times by earnings. Get-
ting back to the profits again for a
moment, it should be pointed out that
some of the recent increase would be
attributable to the takeover of H. B.
Dickie (the towel people) in late 1966.
By the same token, it should also be
remembered that the full benefits of
this deal will not be fully apparent
until the interim and final reports for
the current year are posted. Rather
than wait for the results I bought now.
I got 200.
I see where Wormald Brothers (one
of my portfolio stocks) is attracting a
bit of attention to itself if not its share
price. The company has been demon-
strating how you put out a fire by
shaking a bottle of beer and then
directing the spray at the blaze. All
very interesting, but it doesn’t seem to
have helped the company’s lagging
price. Pity!
My only sale this week was Turner
Industries. I still think this stock is
good value at 37 cents, but I just can’t
resist doing a bit of profit taking. The
deal made me $l7O.

Next week is my week of reckoning,
when I will review my trading per-
formance over the past 12 months. It
will be rather interesting to see how
much the portfolio has gained in such
an exciting and buoyant year of trad-
ing. I should, however, add that for
the most part I have followed a con-
scious policy of staying out of the min-
ing market for reasons I will reiterate
next week, and my performance for the
major part has been based on oper-
ations in the lately oft-forgotten in-
dustrial market.

WILD CAT PAGES
A tough job for the markets

MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
APART FROM THE ABSURD rush
into gold stocks in the faint hope that
the Americans will devalue their dollar,
Australian stockmarkets ended up last
week taking a pretty sensible view of
the changed situation confronting Aus-
tralian business now that Britain and
New Zealand have devalued. The
market eased back a little more than
one percent, which seems to reflect
fairly well the modestly depressing im-
pact that oui decision to hold fast will
mean -
The gold rush is a real long-odds
punting affair. Apparently the market
hopes for a devaluation proposal to get
through the U.S. Congress (where it
would no doubt be debated for weeks
while the gold price went wild). It
all looks extremely unlikely and there
could be a lot of money made on the
options post buying “puts” on every
gold stock on the list (along with those
that only have the word gold in their
name). A far more likely proposition
is that the U.S. might eventually drop
its gold backing to its dollars and this
would knock the stuffing right out of
the gold market.
The markets have a difficult task
to deal with. Sterling devaluation
affects a much wider spectrum of com-
panies than would appear at first sight.
Its'more obvious implications are that
it will knock companies that export
to areas that have devalued, or to
markets where there is competition
from areas that have devalued, such as
the dairy industry, so companies like
Consolidated Milk Industries may find
its new export drive running into some
problems. And so might the sugar
companies like CSR, Millaquin, and
Fairy mead, that were beginning to im-
prove on hopes of better prospects and
which might also suffer in the longer
term, even though their immediate
position is safeguarded by forward
cover on contracts in sterling. Hanimex
also faces problems with British exports.
Already some companies have come
out with statements to reassure their
shareholders, like CSR, APM, Felts,
Bradford Cotton, Kiwi, Frozen Foods,
A. G. Sims, Edwards Dunlop,
Westralian Oil, and Ralta. But most of
these will, nevertheless, feel some im-
pact sooner or later.
Companies that compete with im-
ports from devaluing countries will
clearly face some problems, although
the market is finding it difficult to
make up its mind about some, like the
paper-products industry. For instance,
the cheaper price of New Zealand
forest products in Australia has brought
price falls for Australian Paper Manu-
facturers, and fibre container makers
like Fieldings and Fibre Containers.
But it seems realistic to expect, as APM
pointed out, that cheaper prices for
N.Z. pulp, which APM imports, will
make things pretty good for Australian
paper and container makers and that
New Zealand pulp producers may
prefer not to compete with their cus-
tomers in Australia if they can raise
their Australian sales of pulp suf-
ficiently. Nevertheless, United Empire
Box could be a real threat to its Aus-
tralian competitors.
One company that seems likely to
suffer from N.Z. food exports here is
Petersville, whose frozen-food opera-
tions are substantial, both through its
own brands and through its Gordon
Edgell subsidiary.
Among the worst hit of companies
are those like Berlei, Ralta (the Linda
electric-blanket people), Felt and Tex-
tiles, and Factors Ltd., which earn a
large proportion of their profits in
countries that have devalued. Directors
of Berlei have not been revealing in
recent years just how much of their
profit comes from Britain, but it was
about 70 percent only two years ago.
(About half Ralta’s profits come from
its New Zealand operations, and Felt
and Textiles’ New Zealand subsidiaries
have been contributing significantly to
group profits last year they provided
one-third of the total.)
But there are many importers of
goods from these countries that stand
to do better, like Gollin. And some
companies with New Zealand sub-
sidiaries, like Felt and Textiles, may
be able to do much better in sales from
these to Australia almost enough
The Chartist says:
PLANET GOLD, although only a comparatively new listing, is a stock with
very “bullish” implications for the more speculative-minded investors. Since
December, 1966, a sideways movement above 20c and below 36c prevailed
until last week, when the price rose sharply on very heavy turnover to 48c.
The normal reaction has since followed and the base consolidation suggests a‘
rise to approximately 68c. The point and figure chart which has not been
reproduced here suggests an even higher target of close to $1.20. Better leverage
would be obtained in the Planet Gold options. Last sale price on 23/11/67 —41c.

perhaps to offset me tall in profit that
devaluation will bring in Australian
dollars. For instance, Felt and Textiles’
New Zealand carpets, that it sells here
in some quantity, could well increase
their share of the market at the ex-
pense of local producers like Carpet
Manufacturers and indeed of its
own subsidiaries. On the other hand,
Carpet Manufacturers will presumably
be able to buy the raw material for its
synthetic carpets much cheaper, and
these appear to have been the growth
area for its sales in recent years.
Cheaper imports of raw materials
should be of particular use to the
Australian synthetic textiles business,
not only through direct imports but
also as Fibremakers Ltd. should be able
to produce cheaper yarn from its im-
ported raw materials. So companies like
Universal Textiles and Bruck could
benefit (apart from any specific advan-
tages they may get from having their
longer term materials supplies from
overseas quoted in sterling).
There may be many companies in
this situation of buying goods from
other countries under contracts quoted
in sterling, just as there may be ex-
porters facing losses for the same
reason. Westralian Oil, for example, is
now trying to renegotiate its sterling
ilmenite export contract.
Royalty payments to overseas
principals are not subjects of lengthy
discussion in company balance sheets,
but it seems likely that where these
are expressed in sterling there could
be some significant savings by Aus-
tralian subsidiaries of British com-
panies. This will be one area in which
Australian board members of British
subsidiaries can show whether they are
man enough to put their Australian
company’s interests ahead of the im-
mediate interests of their British
parents.
The list of companies that stand to
suffer losses on their investments over-
seas, particularly New Zealand, is
very large indeed. The loss in these
instances is a double one, for not only
is there a capital loss but the earn-
ings from those investments are now
proportionately lower. Companies like
ACI, CSR, Henry Jones (with its
big holding in J. Wattie), the banks
and insurance offices, and some hire-
purchase companies, Burns Philp,
AWA, Gordon and Gotch, James
Hardie, James Stedman (which has a
reserve of $192,908 available to write
down its assets in line with the
currency drop), General Industries,
Humes, and Schweppes are some of
those who will face fairly large losses.
And, of course, the motor-vehicle
companies stand to lose a fair slice
of their New Zealand market, which
means that parts makers like Duly and
Hansford and Repco will also find
things tougher in their N.Z. exports.
Many Australian companies may well
decide to make the most of the N.Z.
devaluation to switch many of their
exporting operations from Australia to
their N.Z. subsidiaries so that these
subsidiaries may well provide healthily
increased profits and dividends not only
as N.Z. itself gets back on its economic
feet, but from increasing export business,
Then there are the U.K.-based com-
panies like the ANZ and ES & A banks,
Dalgety and New Zealand Loan, New
Broken Hill, and North Kalgurli,
whose dividends in Australian dollar
terms will fall although they may
be largely made up by subsequent rises
since the companies’ earnings should
rise in sterling terms to offset this,
a QUEENSLAND OIL digest’s strong
recommendation has been one factor
- n tbe moU nting support for shares in
tbe Alliance group (Alliance Petroleum
and AOD) that brought a solid price
rise last week after the prev ious week’s
disappointment that the Crayfish gas
in the adjoining BHP tenement was not
commercial. Alliance Petroleum
recovered from 17 cents to 30 cents and
AOD from 34 cents to 49 cents,
Talk q£ further ga§ strikes appeare d
tQ play some part in the risej but
Quentin Cameron’s “Oil Digest” came
out j ast week suggesting that the Cray-
bsb g as discovery had been badly un-
derestimated by the market. He said
that the important thing about Cray-
fish was not that the gas was water-


saturated but that it indicated the
presence of hydrocarbons in the area
and raised the likelihood of further
discoveries either in deeper zones of
the Crayfish well (which found the
earlier gas considerably above target
level) or in nearby wells. And he
stressed that Alliance’s only attractions
in this area were not simply in that its
O.E.L. 22 is adjacent to the Crayfish
hole, but also that this O.E.L. 22 is
held in high regard by oil experts be-
cause it contains sediment similar to
those which have produced large oil
and gas flows in Bass Strait.
Other oil explorers with interests in
O.E.L. 22 are Beach Petroleum (which
has interests in three farmout areas in
the tenement as well as holding the
off-shore-on-shore area O.E.L. 24
north-west of BHP-Esso’s area) and
Santos, which holds almost a one-
third stake in O.E.L. 22 through Gen-
eral Exploration (which would be re-
duced to a quarter if the Alliance
group lifts its stake to 50 percent).
,One unfortunate feature of the oil
search at the moment is that Australian
Oil and Gas shareholders had not been
told the size of their stake in the Gulf
Oil Capricorn well being drilled in
their area north-west of Gladstone. Last
week our table of oil drilling indicated
that Gulf and AOG had half each;
however, it now appears that AOG will
get a production royalty plus a cash
payment covering its expenses in the
area and another out of oil produced.
Shareholders should not be left in the
dark on such a vital matter vitally
affecting the market status of their
shares.
Letter
Optical Industries
I wish to refer to your article on Opti-
cal Industries Limited in the Financial
Section of the Nov. 11 Bulletin.
Toward the end of the article, on
page 53, you state: “A factor account-
ing for the trebling of profits in the last
decade is probably the support of the
medical profession; doctors are believed
to own a fair proportion of the capital,
and many would naturally tend to send
patients with prescriptions to OPSM.”
For your information and for the in-
formation of your readers, I would like
to inform you that in November, 1964,
because of repeated comments that
ophthalmologists owned a major num-
ber of the shares in Optical Industries,
our then president of the Society under-
took a survey of the share register and
it was found that only five ophthal-
mologists held shares—ranging from
120 to 3456, a total of 8620 shares—
while four wives of ophthalmologists
held, in all, 1730 shares. At the re-
quest of the president all five ophthal-
mologists and two of the wives disposed
of their shares.
Therefore, as far as we know, at this
date, no ophthalmologists hold any
shares in Optical Industries Limited.

Security analysis
Working out the per share
earnings of BHP
ONCE UPON A TIME, as in most
fairy stories, it w-as possible to con-
sider the Broken Hill Proprietary
Company Limited as part of the steel
and engineering industry group. Even
then, however, it wasn’t possible to
compare the results of the company
wuth any other in Australia. Today,
the company has reverted to its earlier
condition as a mining company and
I have some doubt that the people who
have been paying nearly $lB.OO for the
shares recently fully realise that BHP
is still the monopolist in iron and steel
manufacturing in Australia.
One analyst certainly hasn’t over-
looked this fact and in a recent study
has predicted that net profit from steel-
making alone will reach $389 million
by 1983-4. Unfortunately, this particu-
lar analyst has just dismissed the pro-
fits from all other sources with the ex-
ception that those from “oil and
natural gas” are expected to be “ex-
tremely large.”
Other analysts have made various
predictions of the earnings from the
various activities in which BHP is now
involved. They have varied in the end
result, but this is not surprising when
one considers the task that these gentle-
men have set themselves. A few over-
looked some of the group’s activities.
Cement w ? as overlooked almost univer-
sally and several publications issued
prior to the 1967 annual report forgot
about the manganese deposits. Perhaps
I will overlook some, too, yet I will
try to list all of them so far as I know
them, and at the same time discuss
their prospects.
IRON AND STEEL MAKING: It is
considered that the present capacity of
the BHP steelworks at Newcastle, Port
Kembla, and Whyalla is of the order of
six million ingot tons per annum. In
addition, the group owns nearly all the
steel-rolling capacity in Australia, as
well as having substantial interests in
other facets of steelmaking (or rather
the extensions of steelmaking). Com-
monwealth Steel Company produces
stainless-steel sheet and strip. Australian
Wire Industries produces wire products
and Titan Manufacturing produces
certain types of equipment and hand
tools.
There are two major problems in
predicting the future profits of the
steelmaking organisation. Firstly, it is
difficult to decide with any accuracy
what will be the rate of grow-th in the
demand for steel in the future. In
BHP’s seventy-fifth anniversary book, it
is stated, “It is likely that the in-
crease in the amount of steel used in
Australia in the coming decade will be
about 5.6 percent each year.” So far,
that is for the first seven years of that
decade, the rate of growth in the usage
of steel has been about percent per
annum compound on average. Whether
one predicts the future growth at the
rate of 5| percent or 8| percent must
have some marked effect on the figure
that one ends up with. The difference
will be greater according to the fur-
ther into the future that one decides to
gaze. For example, over a period of
five years, the 8| percent factor would
be 25 percent greater than the per-
cent factor, but over a period of ten
years it would be 32-| percent greater.
I can see no reason why the growth
rate in the demand for steel should slow
down in the next three to five years; I
would expect some slowing down after
that period. Profits have not quite kept
pace with the growth in local demand
for steel and there are a number of
factors, favorable and unfavorable,
that will affect costs in the next five
years. I think that one can only assume
that they will cancel each other out,
but to be on the safe side I will
assume that profits w'ill increase at the
rate of eight percent per annum for
the next five years. Per share earnings
from steelmaking should be about 48
cents per share in 1971-2.
MOUNT NEWMAN: This is a
joint venture with Dampier Mining (a
wholly owned subsidiary of BHP) par-
ticipating to 30 percent, the other part-
ners being Pilbara Iron (mainly owned
by CSR but with some leading Aus-
tralian financial institutions involved
to provide cheap loan funds in return
for an equity participation), Amax
Iron Ore, Mitsui-C. Itoh, and Seltrust
Iron Ore. A contract is held to supply
a group of Japanese steel mills wuth 100
million tons of iron ore over a period of
fifteen years. In addition the venture
will supply BHP with iron ore; whether
there will be much of a profit in this
for the venture is not knowm at the
moment. It looks as though the ven-
ture wall be selling at least eight million
tons of ore by 1971-2. This figure could
well be greater if new contracts are re-
ceived; it is unlikely that a very sub-
stantial increase in the annual tonnage
could occur in the early years.
Just how- the profits will be distribu-
ted is not known to me but, in a
partnership, one would expect the an-
nual profits to be transferred to the
partners’ accounts. No tax should be
payable and I expect pre-tax profit per
ton to be of the order of $2.75. In
other words, BHP should be receiving
about $6 million per annum from this
venture in 1971-2, or about 5 cents per
share. The big profits from this ven-
ture must be expected after five years
from now, yet it is a very bold man
who would care to predict much be-
yond five years.
BHP also holds some very substan-
tial reserves of iron ore in its own right
and it could be assumed that these will
also be available for a certain amount
of export. I can’t put a figure on this
sort of possibility.
NICKEL: I have deliberately kept
this well down in the text of this article
because the mere mention of the word
is likely to set off the wildest specula-
tion in the shares of any company.
BHP has been exploring areas in
Queensland near Rockhampton and at
Mount Monger, south of Kalgoorlie, in
Western Australia. Neither area has
produced worthwhile results to date, or
if it has it has not leaked on to the
market. While there are undoubted
large deposits near Rockhampton, it
seems that the ore is not an easy one
from which to extract the nickel. This
could well mean that no development
of the deposit will take place in the
near future. Nevertheless, while no esti-
mate can be made of the possible earn-
ings per share at this stage, some
“notional” allowance should perhaps be
made in somewhat the same way that
allowances are made for exploration
activities.

by BHP is quite a large one by world
standards and will not only supply
BHP’s requirements but will also pro-
vide fairly substantial quantities of ore
for export. Because the Bell Bay plant
of Tasmanian Electro Metallurgical Co.
Pty. Ltd. is already producing ferro-
manganese and because some of this
alloy has already been exported to the
U.S.A., it is conceivable that, in due
time, exports may take this form
rather than ore. In the meantime, a
conservative estimate of, say, three cents
per share is made for this portion of
BHP’s interests.
OIL AND NATURAL GAS: Al-
though we know that Esso/BHP has a
commercial gas field which is capable
of supplying about 200 million cubic
feet per day by 1975 and a commercial
oil field capable of supplying about 50
million barrels a day by 1971, there are
some difficulties in making estimates
of the profit that will accrue to BHP
from these fabulous assets. The main
problem is to determine the cost of
developing these assets and then to
determine the amortisation charges and
the rate at which exploration expen-
diture will be written off. Later, after
our target year of 1972, there will be
other problems concerning the price
that will be paid for the oil and there is,
of course, the prospect of further dis-
coveries, which seem highly probable on
the past record and would make a
dramatic difference to the figures that
I am now guesstimating. Using the
Moonie figures, and making some
allowances for the larger production
and for the fact that Esso/BHP’s fields
are off-shore, it looks like about 36
cents per share from oil in 1971-2,
assuming the “incentive” of U.S. 75
cents is still loaded on the price and
assuming that no tax is paid. Natural
gas by a similar rough estimate should
produce about 16 cents per share to
BHP.
SUMMARY: If we now add up the
various earnings per share, we get the
quite substantial figure of $l.OB. No
account has been taken of shipbuilding
and cement, which at the moment are
of little importance in the overall pic-
ture but could well add another couple
of cents per share by 1971-2.
It is unlikely that this calculation
will be dramatically out. Earnings are
unlikely to be as low as 50 cents per
share nor, in my view, as high as $2.00
per share. I do not know what any
investor looks for by way of capital
appreciation—he certainly isn’t looking
for dividend income anymore in buying
BHP’s share at $17 —but let us say that
it is a modest ten percent per annum.
BHP’s shares will need to be selling
for $27 in 1971-2 to achieve this sort
of appreciation. Of course, if there is
substantial nickel at Rockhampton,
they could reach this figure before the
end of 1967.

Behind, the balance sheets
Schweppes’ progressive growth
IT DOES NOT SEEM to have been
only the hot weather putting up the
price of Schweppes (Australia) Ltd.
shares. The 20 cent rise in the past few
weeks, despite the losses in income and
capital terms the company is to suffer
from its New Zealand subsidiaries, fol-
lowing N.Z.’s 20 percent devaluation,
seems to indicate better things for this
company, whose market status had been
dented by the barely steady profit and
lower earning rate reported for 1966-67.
For Schweppes is on the move, with
continuing expansion at a time when
there are indications that the turmoil
in the soft-drink industry, coinciding
last year with a pretty poor season,
has now ended and that competition is
keen but not excessive. The market is
definitely expanding. Australian pro-
duction of aerated and carbonated
waters has grown 28 percent in five
years, from 87,365,000 gallons to
111,586,000 gallons, and in July-August,
1967, production is up 14 percent on
the same months of 1966. Meanwhile
more of this is finding its way to export
markets (perhaps largely Papua and
New Guinea), for the value of exports
of non-alcoholic beverages (excluding
fruit and vegetable juices) soared from
$115,000 in 1962-63 to $708,000 in
1966-67. Schweppes’ own exports have
increased by over 400 percent in the
past three years. Its N.Z. subsidiaries
may be able to increase their export
contribution following devaluation.
So the Australian company could
reap considerable benefits as a result
of the restrictions on British investment
overseas that probably motivated the
parent move to hand over as from
January 1, 1967, the area including
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Cam-
bodia, Laos, and Vietnam to the Aus-
tralian company. In Singapore there
is a bottling plant (a new one is under
construction), but most of the other
markets are served from Australia with
canned products. The English com-
pany still controls Hong Kong and
Japan, but these will probably come
under Australian control one day when
the other South-East Asian markets are
digested. Progressive, rather than head-
long, expansion is the keynote.
Features of the company’s new ex-
pansion are the takeover of its New-
castle franchise-holder in a $1,450,000
deal earlier in the month and its ap-
pointment as exclusive bottler to manu-
facture and market Pepsi-Cola in Mel-
bourne and environs, where previously
Pepsi was not available. On the first
day of the new financial year,
Schweppes bought two companies from
Pepsi-Cola Co. of Australia Pty. Ltd.,
the American Beverage Co. Pty. Ltd.
of Adelaide, and the Mt. Gambier
Bottling Cc* Pty. Ltd. of Mt. Gambier.
PepsiCo International granted
Schweppes exclusive bottling appoint-
ments for Adelaide and the Mt.
Gambier markets. The Mt. Gambier
factory will produce Schweppes
products, and the Pepsi and Mirinda
products formerly made at Queens-
town (S.A.) will now be produced at
Schweppes’ newly enlarged plant at
Payneham.
The close association between
Schweppes and Pepsi-Cola overseas
paved the way for liaison here. In
London, Schweppes have been the
authorised bottlers for Pepsi for ten
years, manufacturing and selling Pepsi
in the south of England, where they
claim to outsell Coca-Cola, the big
seller in the cola field in Australia.
Maybe the visit of PepsiCo Interna-
tionals area vice-president for the Far
East to Melbourne for the introduction
of Pepsi to the Melbourne market
(which culminated more than 12
months’ intensive research and planning
with Schweppes) presages a closer
alliance between Pepsi and Schweppes
in the Far East. In any event, the man-
aging director indicated that the
group’s progress since balance date has
been good and ahead of budget.
And profits should be assisted by the
rise in the wholesale prices of most of
the company’s products this financial
year to the benefit of profits that had
been squeezed by the sugar price in-
crease in June and another lift in wages
in July. The profit-to-sales ratio was
reduced in 1967 by wage rises, but the
very pleasing rate of growth in turn-
over was maintained. Sales are not dis-
closed in this competitive industry, but
increases in the past four years have
been 18 percent, 16 percent, 10.4 per-
cent, and, most recently, 18.8 percent.
Most soft-drink manufacturers com-
plained of a poor 1966-67 summer in
Melbourne, but this year’s drought
could have increased customer thirst,
and an unusually mild winter and early
summer heat in Victoria now should
favor Schweppes, just as it has helped
a couple of other southern producers.
In its Australian operations,
Schweppes has bottling factories in six
capitals, and since the Lambton Hold-
ings takeover in Newcastle, the number
of franchise-holders in Australia has
been reduced to 11. The company
regards Newcastle as a fast-growing
area which could be an important link
in the chain of company-owned plants
and which could be expanded as a base
for northern development. The cost
of this acquisition was $700,000 in cash
and the issue of 500,000 50c shares
(reducing the English parent’s holding
to 63.8 percent), but the Adelaide and
Mt. Gambier businesses were acquired
for an undisclosed cash figure.
The indications seem to be that
Schweppes may well have more expan-
sionary moves in mind sooner or later;
the list of its franchise bottlers gives
some food for thought, as it includes
two Cohn Bros, subsidiaries.
Last week’s devaluation news does
have its complications for Schweppes,
which is controlled by its British parent
company. Although they are not re-
vealed, it is possible that any royalty
payments the company may pay the
British parent could possibly be in
sterling, which would mean a reduc-
tion in their cost to the Australian com-
pany in dollars. It is also possible that
British investors, unwilling to chase the
small yields on the high London mar-
ket, are quite prepared to jump the
extra hurdle in buying Australian stocks-
in depreciated currency; and
Schweppes is a name they know.
Nevertheless, Schweppes will suffer
some income loss from New Zealand
as a result of devaluation, although it
may be only as much as six or seven
percent.
For N.Z. profits available to the Aus-
tralian company are possibly one-third
as big as profits from Australian opera-
tions. Schweppes N.Z. is 51 percent
owned, and the minority shareholders’
share of 1967 profit was $81,294, so
Schweppes Australia’s share of N.Z.
subsidiary profits was around $84,500,
plus the best part of the $91,000 earned
as “income from properties and other
investments,” the latter being the 50
percent (and thus unconsolidated)
interest held by the N.Z. subsidiary in
Innes Tartan Ltd.

alisation of production and selling was
undertaken in recent years. In 1964-65
a new bottling factory was completed
in Auckland, and duplication of fac-
tories in country towns has been pro-
gressively eliminated. There are now
franchise bottlers in 12 N.Z. towns. The
general state of N.Z.’s economy made
trading conditions difficult in 1967, and
the company complained at the restric-
tion and reduction of bank finance.
The soft-drink industry is moving to
disposable containers, such as cans and
non-returnable bottles suitable for chain
stores and supermarkets. This will be a
welcome move to Schweppes, which at
1967 balance date had $3.8 million in
containers (bottles and crates) and a
liability to customers for deposits on
containers of $| million. Container
stocks rose $J million, reflecting in-
creased trade, as did the 10 percent
incerase in stocks (to a mere $1
million). However, the 32 percent
increase in trade debtors to $938,800
(without any increase in the small debts
provision of only $25,492) is a far faster
rise than in sales.
Although current ratio of 1.1 at June
30, 1967, is much the same as usual,
the company has had to marshal its
funds more carefully of late. Up to
1967 it has advances of as much as
$1 million from the parent. This had
been gradually reduced to $£ million
by 1966 balance date, and this loan was
sufficient to permit the parent to take
up its entitlement to a one-for-seven
issue at 25c premium in October, 1966,
when funds were hard to get out of
Britain. The local company arranged
long-term bank finance for $281,000,
and the overdraft was extended from
$408,000 to $590,000, but the interest
bill of $39,000 (actually smaller than
in 1966) is of no great moment.
Capital commitments at balance date
hafve soared from $37,000 in 1963 to
$191,000 in 1965 and $512,000 in 1967.
Expenditure planned for this year was
mainly in plant for Australia, extending
two factories (in Perth and Adelaide),
and the establishment of a large depot
at Ballarat, where manufacturing will
begin within the year.
Fresh investment in land, buildings,
plant, and equipment has barely ex-
ceeded annual depreciation charges.
Fixed assets in 1967 were $4,097,000
compared with $3,868,000 in 1964 when
Innes Tartan ceased to be a subsidiary
and became an investment. (This ac-
counts for the $819,000, shares in other
companies, in 1967 group accounts.)

Mining
CSR’s stake in Nabalco
THE RECENT POPULARITY of
Colonial Sugar Refining Company as a
mining investment received a sharp
shock from devaluation. In a short
period it was quickly realised that the
sugar industry was one group of listed
companies which would clearly suffer,
perhaps considerably, from the change
in exchange rates, and CSR shares fell
quite heavily in trading on the Mel-
bourne Exchange the day following
Mr. Wilson’s announcement. The fol-
lowing day Colonial Sugar Refining
made an announcement that the 1967
Australian crop was fully safeguarded
against a change in exchange rates, and
that it had also protected sales of Aus-
tralian sugar, under the British Com-
monwealth Sugar Agreement, up to
December next year by the arrange-
ment of forward contracts at the
former exchange rates. This agreement
was, in any case, due to be renegoti-
ated toward the end of 1968.
This announcement allowed the
mining interests of the company to re-
assert themselves. Nevertheless, the de-
valuation of Fiji, in which the company
has considerable interests, and the
application (if successful) of Britain to
join the Common Market may have
considerable repercussions on profits
from sugar in the next, few years, when
the company faces heavy capital com-
mitments for its mining ventures.
Nabalco Pty. Limited is now adver-
tising for senior staff to handle design
and transport work for its development
of an alumina industry from deposits of
bauxite at Gove, situated on the
eastern-most corner of the Northern
Territory, on the same latitude as
Darwin. Although there has been no
official announcement, it appears that
this project is to proceed as scheduled,
which will mean the establishment of
Australia’s third major alumina project,
after Comalco’s activities at Weipa and
Gladstone and Alcoa’s operations at
Kwinana in Western Australia. The
project is similar to the Mount New-
man iron ore syndicate in that it has a
pleasingly high proportion of local
equity. Nabalco Pty. Limited is 50 per-
cent owned by Swiss Aluminium Limi-
ted, while local institutions and mining
companies (including CSR) are to con-
tribute the remaining 50 percent equity
in the venture. The Australian com-
ponent is as follows: The Colonial
Sugar Refining Company Limited
percent; The Australian Mutual Pro-
vident Society 5 percent; Peko-Walls-
end Investments Limited 3f percent;
The Mutual Life & Citizen?’ Assurance
Co. Limited 3f percent; The Bank of
New South Wales 2\ percent; The
Commercial Banking Company of
Sydney Limited 2\ percent; Elder
Smith Goldsborough Mort Limited 2\
percent, and Mount Morgan Limited
2j percent.
These equity interests involve a total
contribution of $2O million, with Swiss
Aluminium contributing a further $2O
million and the remaining $6O million
or so to be met by borrowings.
The initial stages of the operation
will involve port dredging and con-
struction, transport and loading facili-
ties, and will cost perhaps $lO mil-
lion. The major expense will be in the
refinery, which will convert the raw
bauxite into alumina by chemical pro-
cesses involving caustic soda, limestone,
and other chemicals. There is no sug-
gestion at this stage that an aluminium
smelter will be involved, as Swiss Alu-
minium will be using the alumina pro-
duced to feed its European and
American refineries. Exports from
Gove should commence around 1972
at the rate of some 500,000 tons of
alumina per annum, and over several
years will build up to an eventual one
million tons annually.
Swiss Aluminium is confident of
future demand requiring additional raw
material supplies, and its interest in
the venture was to secure a reliable
source of these requirements. For this
reason it is unlikely that an aluminium
refinery will ever be established as part
of the project, but in any case this
would hardly be practicable without
sources of large quantities of low-cost
electric power. At this stage the only
likely feasible type of power plant in
this area would be a nuclear-fuelled
one. By the time such a plant could be
considered, it may be commercially
feasible for Swiss Aluminium to enter
the Australian market for aluminium
metal, but the existence of already
strong local competition in this field at
present seems to indicate that this is
an unlikely possibility. Nevertheless,
Nabalco could find itself supplying
bauxite or alumina to the other com-
panies operating here, should they find
themselves pressed for raw-material
supplies.
With its sole customer (to date)
owning 50 percent of its capital, Nab-
alco certainly appears unlikely to be
as profitable an operation as the
Comalco bauxite mine at Weipa
and possibly with this in view there is
a condition in the existing arrangement
entitling the Australian companies to
withdraw from the venture if the
feasibility study shows a profit after
tax equivalent to less than 7\ percent
on ordinary .capital.
Comalco Industries Pty. Limited
(jointly owned by Conzinc Riotinto of
Australia Limited and Kaiser
Aluminium and Chemical Corporation
of the U.S.A.) earned $4.3 million for
the year to December last, which was
equivalent to 14.4 percent on its capital

of $3O million. Comalco operates a
smelter at Bell Bay, and some of this
profit was due to operations other than
sales of bauxite and alumina. Another
complication in using Comalco’s figures
as a standard is that on long-term
loans of some $6O million the company
paid interest of only $1.5 million. This
very low interest rate reflects loans
made available on favorable terms by
the two shareholding companies and
it is doubtful whether the Australian
bank investors in Nabalco could afford
to follow such a policy of low-interest
loans. However, if Comalco’s loans
were at normal market rates the com-
pany would still have shown an earn-
ing rate close to 10 percent on ordin-
ary capital. Comalco’s major Austra-
lian competitor, Alcoa of Australia
Pty. Limited, pays a more realistic in-
terest bill than Comalco, and has been
much slower to achieve profitability.
The experiences of these companies
are not much help in estimating Nab-
alco’s profitability except that they do
suggest that on Nabalco’s investment of
both equity and loan funds of some
$lOO million, earnings at full capacity
in 5 or 6 years time could be at the
rate of $lO million a year before tax
and interest, and at least cover the 72-
percent equity return required by the
Australian partners. In the longer
term, provided that Swiss Aluminium
is prepared to take out its profits as
dividends rather than in lower prices,
earnings should be considerably higher
than this. It is doubtful whether they
can ever be expected to approach
CSR’s likely earnings from its invest-
ment in the Mount Newman iron ore
venture. CSR’s equity in this venture
will be (by coincidence almost the same
as its interest in Nabalco Pty. Limited)
$11,424,000. Using the after-tax profit-
per-ton figure of $2.20, estimated by
Hamersley for the 10 million tons it
expects to ship in 1972, the Mount
Newman venture will earn something
like $26 million after tax in 1975-76
without making any allowance for earn-
ings on its sales to BHP.
Pilbara Iron Limited, the CSR-led
30 percent partner in Mount Newman,
will receive as its share of this profit
$8 million, from which debenture in-
terest of $2.5 to $2.8 million will have
to be paid, leaving equity profit of $5.2
to $5.5 million. CSR’s 68 percent of
this figure amounts to at least $3.5 mil-
lion rather more favorable than the
$825,000 which the company can
expect to receive as a minimum figure
on its $ll million investment in Nab-
alco Pty. Limited. Both of these profits
will be subject to upward revision in
the future, particularly should addi-
tional contracts for iron ore exports be
received by the Mount Newman syndi-
cate (which is quite likely). It is easy
to envisage that when both these pro-
jects reach their operating capacity,
they will contribute at least one-third
of CSR’s profits.

Commodities
A legion of price
rises., and gold
THE POUND’S DEVALUATION is
of course by far the greatest influence
ruling the London commodity markets
at the moment, and appears likely to
remain so for a week or two to come.
Probably very few items will, in the
end, advance to the full proportion of
the devaluing percentage; as they reach
their respective plateaus, more normal
considerations of supply-demand will
start to operate once more. While
Britain’s demand for the base metals,
for instance, may be less elastic than
that for foodstuffs, it must be remem-
bered that the post-devaluation in-
dustrial tempo sets the pattern of future
requirements. The high Bank Rate also
is, among other things, not likely to
facilitate big holdings of stocks. After
the first flush of corrective price rises,
producers will be watching the British
economy very keenly.
Impelled by sterling’s uncertainties,
the markets, in the week prior to de-
valuation, naturally indulged in a fair
amount of hedging, which helped to
start the upward movements. Rubber,
sugar, coffee, cocoa, tin, and the base
metals were clearly affected. It is inter-
esting to see the process still continuing
among some products which closely
concern Australia.
Last week, tin, copper, and zinc (see
below) were pushed well up on deval-
uation considerations alone. Lead, how-
ever, which shared these movements,
also seemed to meet a fair measure of
consumer inquiry. Sugar faced some
resistance at its higher levels, although
buying was on a rather thin market.
(Australia’s own sugar receipts for the
1967 season will ibe unaffected, since
CSR protected them by means of for-
ward contracts.)
All these various surges could prob-
ably be described as quite natural, but
when the spotlight lingered on gold,
great technical and currency questions
began to take shape. Suspicion (and
a coming attack?) has now started to
attach to the American dollar. Bullion
buying in London is occurring at a
“fantastic rate” and there is even talk
of separating dealings in “official gold”
from “commodity gold.”
AT ONE STAGE, just a few days be-
fore the devaluation of sterling, spot
prices for zinc on the London Metal
Exchange rose distinctly above the pro-
ducers’ fixed price. This certainly did
not indicate that there was any world
shortage of zinc.
Indeed, a 1968 world surplus of
some 300,000 tons had already been
forecast by the Lead and Zinc Study
Group. This, when given, also took
notice of the 5000 tons a week being
lost as a result of the American copper
strike. At the time of writing, the
strike would have to go on about an-
other 30 weeks to abolish the predicted
surplus. The U.S. stockpile, too, still
holds about one million tons, while
producer stocks remain quite high as
Producers, perhaps to their sorrow,
are well aware that there is no lack of
the metal available for consumers, and
that there is no immediate necessity to
restore the 15 percent cut in output
effected early this year. They have a
further possible complication to cope
with the threat of a strike at Gen-
eral Motors.
Speaking to North Broken Hill’s
annual meeting late in October, the
chairman, Mr. M. L. Baillieu, rather
optimistically hoped that consumption
would approximate production for
(calendar) 1967. Under the existing
consumption pattern, Mr. Baillieu des-
cribed two producer alternatives:
“either to produce to excess and
‘scramble’ for the available demand, or

logically and sensibly to organise offer-
ings in reasonable relationship to the
available demand.” Happily, he felt
“some major producers have been pre-
pared to adjust their production to
demand, rather than attempt to sell in
excess of current requirements, with
consequent price deflation.”
Incidentally, this type of argument
applies equally to lead. More lead
will be available by the second half of
1968, leading to a sizable statistical
surplus. Lead thus becomes “more dif-
ficult to sell . . . than over the past
five years.”
SULPHUR SUPPLIES, as mentioned
in The Bulletin of November 18, were
expected to improve during 1967. So
far the predictions are well on course,
with the full year’s output from non-
Communist sources aiming toward
15.5 million tons, against 1966’s 14.31
million tons. Yet so great is the pull
of demand, especially for fertiliser
manufacture, that price increases have
been a very distinctive feature of the
past month or so. The grouped U.S.
exporters recently proclaimed a SU.S.2
a ton increase to apply for the first half
of 1968.
The future course of the market
could seem to depend almost entirely
on the finding and development of new
sources of supply. Without these, prices
are sure to continue high and substitu-
tion pose an additional threat. And
the immediate situation for the world
outside the U.S.A. hangs on consump-
tion there, particularly as it is taken
up by the making of phosphate
fertiliser.
At present Canada appears to be the
most significant country in the dis-
covery and development of new sources
of elemental sulphur, thus establishing
the supply pattern for the whole of
North America (where the largest de-
mand occurs) and thereby determining
the availability of sulphur for export.
All this gives a reasonable short-term
position, yet the longer-term prospects
don’t look so bright. The best hopes
for additional supplies lie in perfection
of processes for recovering sulphur
from oil refineries.
THE INTERNATIONAL TEA Com-
mittee is now able to announce that
world production for the first nine
months of 1967 was only a little below
its level for the corresponding period
of 1966. The committee believes the
full year’s output may exceed that for
1966. Declines in South India and
Ceylon have been practically overcome
by much higher production from North
India.
London prices must soon begin to
react to the improving supply position.
They were kept up by such things as
the Suez Canal closure, and dock
strikes in England and Ceylon. The
supply lag had mounted to 64 million
lb. at the end of October (to contrast
with 12 million lb. afloat on October
28, 1966). This hold-up is being gradu-
ally overtaken.
The Ceylon strikes, and reduced
production, have naturally affected tea
entering Australia, since Ceylon pro-
vides more than half of local tea im-
ports. The full 1966 year saw imports
down on both 1964 and 1965, but the
situation should be corrected over the
next few months.


THE LAND
Wool won’t get its relief
through the tariff
THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS of the
British devaluation on rural industries,
and the implications of Australia not
following the pound down in any way,
are examined on pages 18 to 20 of
this issue. It is evident that the greatest
troubles will be experienced by dairy-
ing, sugar, dried fruit, and canned
fruits. These can all be expected to be
pressing for some kind of compensation
when the Federal Government gets
around to treating their claims in detail
almost certainly just after the
Minister for Trade and Leader of the
Country Party, Mr. John McEwen,
returns from Geneva on December 14.
All discussions must be held, of
course, in> the certain knowledge that,
devaluation or no, both rural produc-
tion as a whole and farm incomes are
headed for quite drastic falls in the
1967-68 year. Present estimates are put-
ting the gross value of rural output at
about $3400 million, as against more
than $3700 million in 1966-67. Crops
rather than livestock products will take
the main burden of this fall, since a
22.1 percent decline in their gross
value is expected.
Yet what brings particular concern to
farmers generally is the continuing in-
creases in farm costs. They have been
showing an average rise of about six
percent per annum over recent years.
The costs balloon had undoubtedly be-
come the most vociferous ground of
complaint among farmers before the
problems of devaluation struck them.
Nowhere has this been more obvious
than in the case of wool, for the per-
petual struggle is clearly emphasised
against a background of falling prices.
And the wool industry is backed by a
generally admitted efficiency (unlike
much dairying) and, until now, a wide
reluctance even to consider direct
subsidies.
The devaluation first brought a recur-
rence of some of the older ideas propa-
gated by such bodies as the Australian
Woolgrowers and Graziers’ Council.
Its president, Mr. T. B. C. Walker,
hard upon the British move, recalled
that “a strong case has existed for some
time for a unilateral devaluation by
Australia to relieve the export industries
of the rising pressure of internal costs.”
Tacked on to this fascinating advocacy
was the notion of a “compensatory ad-
justment in the level of the tariff, in
order to offset the effects of higher
import costs as far as possible, and
other economic measures designed to
dampen cost pressures.”
Well, the Government made it
wholly clear last week that it rejects
each of these palliatives in principle
as a solution of difficulties afflicting
farmers in general and the wool in-
dustry in particular. Very recently, too,
Mr. McEwen, addressing the National
Farmers’ Union on October 24, read
them a lesson on the alleged costs of
the tariff.
He argued from a close departmental
study based on woolgrowers’ costs and
returns established by the Bureau of
Agricultural Economics. The average
N.S.W. woolgrower apparently secures
52.7 percent of his income from wool.
The cost of the tariff on his wool,
taking other activities into considera-
tion, works out at less than one cent a
l'b. “This is important,” Mr. McEwen
commented, “but not of critical im-
portance. I am told the cost buiden
attributable to the tariff and bounty
applicable to items directly required
by woolgrowers is .85 cents a lb. This
is the cost of the tariff on the things
he buys, not on the other things the
community buys.”
Mr. McEwen could not resist adding
that the Government’s grants for
research and promotion equalled about
.75 cents per lb. of wool, so that the
difference between the tariff burden
and the Treasury’s benificence “is quite
microscopic and of no real economic
significance.” Admitting the overall
costs problem, Mr. McEwen once more
told woolgrowers that a frontal attack
on the tariff was useless and really a
diversion from studying themselves.
Nonetheless, the situation for wool
won’t blow away, whatever the results
from the first post-devaluation sales.
Perhaps direct subsidies will be resisted
for some time to come; they would
probaly constitute unwise strategy while
the industry has still to resolve its mar-
keting differences. There is, however,
as some graziers suggest, a case for aid
along the lines of rationalisation of
transport and relief in land tax and
shire rates. What they call “a reduction
in the protection afforded secondary
industry and a more realistic exchange
rate” are out.

Startling facts about weeds
EVERY MAN, WOMAN, and child
in Australia is now spending 60 cents
a year on herbicides and stepping up
this rate of expenditure by ten per-
cent annually. The total bill last year
was nearly $8 million, but not much
more than half this was run up by
farmers. The rest includes non-agri-
cultural uses such as railways, town
councils, forestry, water supply, and
home gardens. Clearly, weeds are
everyone’s concern.
How much weeds cost Australia can-
not be estimated, but the figure in
money value alone would be staggering.
Some calculable individual costs indi-
cate the magnitude of the scale. Had
last year’s wheat crop, for instance,
been more or less weed-free, it would
have yielded another $74 million worth
of grain, even by the lowest estimate.
Less than 20 percent of the wheat
acreage is treated effectively with herbi-
cides at present, so there is plenty of
scope for improvement still. Without
weed control in cotton there would
scarcely be a crop to harvest; the
people comprising this modern industry
would be the most weed-conscious
group of all. The banana growers in
New South Wales are also keen
weeders. Though this industry occupies
only 24,000 acres, it is reckoned to
spend $1 million on labor and materials
annually and still doesn’t achieve any-
thing like complete freedom from
weeds. The orchard croppers of that
State spend nearly twice this sum, but
continue to suffer at least sl| million
i n l° ss production,
The average shire council in New
South Wales, and there are 133 of them
altogether, spends $6OOO annually on
weed control. To this ought to be added
the very considerable sums devoted to
weeds by the Pastures Protection
Boards and the Prickly Pear Commis-
sion. The authorities in charge of high-
ways spend about $3O per mile,
amounting to $l7 million a year, on
the maintenance of roads and bridges,
An unknown but high proportion of
this is for weed suppression to improve
visibility, to prevent “narrowing” as

a result of weeds encroaching on the
shoulders of the road, and to keep
them looking tidy. Weeds contribute
to the road toll.
Land-clearing, which is largely a
matter of ridding an area of woody
weeds, costs anywhere from about $5
to $BO an acre. The Forestry Com-
mission in New South Wales spends
considerably in excess of $1 million
a year, but this is only playing with the
job of weed suppression in the State’s
eight million acres of forests.
It is quite clear that State Govern-
ment votes for weed destruction by
the several instrumentalities involved
must be increased. Vegetable fault in
the national wool clip is very con-
servatively estimated at $2 million, but
precious little is being done to alleviate
this loss.
These are just a sample of the assess-
able losses and costs in some crops and
situations. The indirect losses, which
are immeasurable, undoubtedly amount
to a much greater sum, however. Weeds
harbor pests and diseases. They reduce
land values. Poisonous plants cause un-
told losses due to ill-thrift, infertility,
and mortality in livestock, and often
necessitate roundabout methods of
grazing management.
In addition, the toll exacted in
terms of human health, worry, and
the restrictions imposed on recrea-
tional pleasures must be counted. The
adverse effects of weeds on humans
are much greater than people generally
appreciate.
These are just a few of the more
startling facts and reminders mentioned
during the first public meeting of the
Weed Society of New South Wales
held earlier this month. This society
was formed about two years ago in
order to encourage the study of weed
science and to promote wider interest
in weed control. Another of its aims
is to establish an Australia-wide weeds
organisation. Victoria, is the only other
State that has a sister society at present.
It is to be hoped that the movement
outflourishes the weeds.
Perhaps the most reassuring message
to be derived from the meeting was
that modern weapons and techniques
are now available for knocking almost
every weed problem in this country.
Over the last decade weed control has
been revolutionised and economised.
Laborious mechanical methods have
been largely replaced by chemical con-
trols. (In 1957, 40 chemicals were
recognised as herbicides, whereas now
more than 120 are registered.) While
improvements in the technique of using
these chemicals can still be made, dele-
gates at the meeting were unanimous
that the main obstacle to weed control
was lack of appreciation of the harm
that they cause and of the methods at
hand for' their suppression. In other
words, weed control is a matter for
adult education and the agricultural
extension services.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
Naturally the British devaluation produced violent oscilla-
tions throughout Australian markets, yet by Thursday (of last
week) many shares, notably miners and oils, had recovered
their aplomb; Friday saw further unsettlement stemming
largely from profit-taking. BHP dropped back a net 35 cents to
finish at $16.45, while Western Mining achieved a 90 cent leap
to $29.90; Great Boulder shed 40 cents, closing at $12.00.
Remarkably, Hamersley and North Broken Hill ended
steady. Henry Jones gained 10 cents and Thiess 25 cents;
Elders GM lost 15 cents.

was for the actor to know what play
he was in. In Australia, when it comes
to Moliere, most actors, and producers,
seem to think they are dealing with
some rather tedious old plays which
can only be put over if they are played
for all they are worth as period farce.
Out come the property-box paunches,
the funny spectacles, the costumes and
wigs and quirks. It is true that “The
Imaginary Invalid” is a boisterous and
farcical comedy, much closer to the
commedia dell’arte than the witty and
classical “The Misanthrope,” but it is
the* obvious unwillingness of Australian
productions to trust the play that is so
irritating. Ron Haddrick sets the style
with a caricature Argan, whose comic
business is like a constant digging in
the ribs.
Remembering the witty, intelligent,
and very funny production of “Les
Femmes Savantes,” by the French com-
pany Le Treteau de Paris, I cannot
believe that Moliere needs to be treated
so cavalierly. There is, in fact, one ex-
ception to this prevailing Australian
mistrust of Moliere, and that is the
approach of the New Theatre Com-
pany, which manages to perform this
dramatist as though his plays belong
to the living theatre. The reason is
ideological: they think Moliere exposes
bourgeois corruption and decadence.
But it would be enough just to think
that he exposes human folly and weak-
ness. The New Theatre’s playing is
broad comedy, without the consummate
skill and subtlety of the French style,
but it has an engaging naturalness and
liveliness.
There are two exceptional perform-
ances in the Old Tote evening. Kirrily
Nolan reveals a lively comic talent as
the outspoken Toinette which would
make'her at home in a New Theatre
production. Jacki Weaver as Louise,
Angelique’s little sister, has a French
precision and economy in her very
funny scene as a diminutive adept in
the art of manipulating adults by dead-
pan innocence.
While, with Moliere, the company
seems to be doing its best to defeat the
play, with the Shaw the play seems
designed to defeat the company. That
it does not altogether succeed is. due
partly to its having a large collection
of familiar Shavian “characters” and
partly to the fact that the company
does know pretty well what play it is
in.
“Getting Married” is really a kind
of symposium or round-table confer-
ence about the institution of marriage.
With the guests already assembling at
the church, Edith and Cecil, the bride
and groom, are locked in their respec-
tive rooms devouring pamphlets about
the iniquities and irrationalities of
marriage. When they decide simul-
Carmen Duncan and Donald Macdon-
ald in “Getting Married” Independent,
Sydney
taneously not to step into this trap, the
assembled relatives set about trying to
draw up a marriage contract which the
pair will be content to accept. After
a couple of hours’ turning intellectual
somersaults, everyone finishes right side
up again, only moi;e so.
The pleasant thing about the Inde-
pendent’s new repertory system is that
it is like a lucky dip in which the
members of the company get more
than one chance of drawing a part to
suit their special talents. In “Getting
Married,” Donald Macdonald draws a
plum as St. John Hotchkiss, the arch-
snob whose punishment is to be en-
slaved by the charms of Mrs. George,
the greengrocer’s sister - in - law,
Mayoress, and seer. Doreen Warburton
certainly looks the part as she sails
majestically, but it is a pity that Shaw
took Mrs. George so seriously. Young
Leo, the straying wife of old Reggie,
is absolutely delightful in Carmen Dun-
can’s performance, perhaps because
Shaw did not take her seriously at all.
Reggie is a very sympathetic character
and Alexander Hay plays him thus.
But Brian James’ Bishop, with his.
gobbling voice, seems to me a stock
Bishop rather than the clever scholar
and intellectual created by Shaw. But,
clever as he is, even he has to call in
the lower classes, in the shape of the
greengrocer (Gordon Glenwright) and
Mrs. George, to supply the practical
commonsense needed to get the young
couple finally married.
Three of a kind
By ROBERT WARD
An Evening with Strindberg. Sheridan,
Adelaide.
Rattle of a Simple Man. Charles Dyer.
Theatre 62, Adelaide.
PROFESSOR WAL CHERRY recently
remarked that Adelaide’s Sheridan
Theatre “is the only South Australian
theatre that really seems to know where
it’s going.” He may be right. Each
year the Sheridan presents a group
of plays of genuine intellectual or
theatrical merit, and each production
is in the main directed and acted with
sensitivity and clear-headed intelli-
gence.
The Sheridan has found another
director of quality in Marlis Thiersch.
Her . “An Evening With Strindberg”
contains two short piedes, “The
Stronger” and “Playing With Fire,”
and the last act from “The Ghost
Sonata.”
In her choice of “The Stronger” she
set herself a considerable task. It has
only one speaking part, that of Madame
X, who meets an old friend, Madam-
oiselle Y, in a cafe on Christmas Eve.
She is surprised to find her there alone,
and as she chatters on about the old
days, their past close friendship, and
her husband’s faithfulness she realises
that in truth she is speaking to her
husband’s old lover. Thus the part
requires considerable virtuosity, for it
is a very complex piece of high natur-
alism, with Madame X commencing
gaily chattering and concluding bitter,
vindictive, and scarcely able to con-
ceal her real anguish. Valerie Mil-
dred’s performance of the part-is highly
creditable as an exercise in technique,
but it lacks heart. Madame X really
needs a young Paxinou.


“Playing With Fire” is a light and
somewhat autobiographical satire on
the late nineteenth century artistic life.
The Artist suggests to his wife that
a family friend might make her a
pleasant companion in bed, while he
endeavors to gain the attentions of his
cousin, who, we suspect, is more inter-
ested in the Artist’s Father’s money.
The play was written to be performed
in Strindberg’s own intimate theatre,
and so it is ideally suited to the
Sheridan. It is performed with good
humor by a strong cast.
“The Ghost Sonata” strikes me as art
awkward choice, since the morbid
atmosphere of the play can only be
established by the whole work. As
we see it, the Student and the Young
Lady are together among suffocating
massed flowers. We glimpse the
heightened, fantastic mood of the com-
plete play, and some of Strindberg’s
cynic disillusionment, but the full im-
pact is not there, for one is continually
aware of unseen scenes.
Theatre 62’s “Rattle of a Simple
Man” is the simple story of a good-
hearted prostitute, Cyrenne, who meets
a virginal man, Percy, who has come
down to London for a football match.
He ’ plays at being a provincial Don
Juan, she at being a lady with in-
dependent means and an aristocratic
background, and the comedy arises
when the realities and fantasies meet.
Tina Hurley’s Cyrenne lacks the
strained, brash quality the character
needs, while John Gaden’s Percy is an
excellent heavy-footed, gangling, simple-
minded yokel. He shows a natural flair
for this kind of bread-and-butter piece.
Khail Jureidini’s Ricard, Cyrenne’s
brother who returns from abroad to
find his sister in business, is a straight-
forward and credible Greek-Italian,
very Conscious of family honor. The
play is directed by John Edmund, but
lacks his usual polish and control.
Films
Change of pace
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Red Desert. Director, Michelangelo
Antonioni.
Privilege. Director, Peter Watkins.
A CHANCE RELEASE pattern here
gives us an interesting view of the two
sides of Antonioni’s constant theme.
Whereas in the later-made “Blow-Up”
he shows us a. man incapable of lov-
ing, “Red Desert” presents a woman
driven to the edges of madness be-
cause she is filled with love and con-
cern in a society which finds such
emotions foolish and socially gauche.
Seeing the two films within a space
of a fortnight, one realises that a
change of scene was just what Anton-
ioni needed. “Red Desert” has none
of the economy and pace of his newer
film, yet it is often fascinating, not
only for its sincerity and for Monica
Vitti’s deeply understanding acting but
for its great beauty.
Indeed, the last quality occasion-
ally turns into a defect. This was
Antonioni’s first film in color and he’s
often so fascinated by its possibilities
that he forgets his theme in a dis-
play of pretty pictures. A sort of
allegorical fantasy-sequence when the
woman tells a story to her child, for
instance, is a pleasure to the eye and
a thorough bore to the mind; and
though the director intends to show
us a man-made desert, a. countryside
despoiled and poisoned by industrialism,
his painterly eye can’t help seeing the
decorative values of the place. While
the beauty of “Blow-Up” was always
secondary to, and inspired by, the
theme, the technique in “Red Desert”
is obtrusive often to the point of dis-
tracting attention from what it’s try-
ing to convey.
Still, we don’t often find the camera
and the soundtrack used with such
brilliance; Monica Vitti gives an ex-
tremely moving performance (though
not greatly aided by Richard Harris’
dim acting as her lover), and with
all its faults of diffuseness this is an
interesting film for its own sake.
“Privilege” is a story of “Britain
in the near future,” when a benevolently
despotic government uses the adora-
tion of the masses for a pop singer
as a safety valve for any awkward
feelings of dissatisfaction, violence, and
revolt. The poor young man isn’t too
bright, but even he begins to notice
the flaws in the argument, after which
he’s coldly disposed' of by his
“owners.” (The rulers in “Brave New
World” and “1984” were smarter, by
choosing respectively a dead and a
non-existent object of worship who
couldn’t embarrass them.)
We’re often counselled to keep a
warm heart and a cool head; but
Peter Watkins, though he often goes
through the motions of being a hot-
head, gives me the impression of ex-
treme coldness of heart. I felt that he
was trying to manipulate the emotions
of his audience with just the same
cynical calculation as his imagined
Establishment used toward their gullible
citizens. I don’t argue for a second
with his theme, but I resent and reject
his assumption that I can be bulldozed
into disapproval of bulldozing.
Watkins, in support of his assumed
surge of indignation, has adopted a
newsreel-cum-television technique
hand-held cameras, off-screen inter-
views, the lot - which accords rather
ill with the very sleek color photog-
raphy; the acting is- often vehement
but rarely even adequate. As for Jean
Shrimpton’s much-publicised screen
debut, she looks extremely pretty, talks
like a budgerigar, and doesn’t act at
all.
Art
Southern light
on Nolan
By ELWYN LYNN
Nolan’s 1946-47 Kelly Paintings. Tol-
arno Galleries, Melbourne.
Nolan, 1939-47. Strines Gallery, Mel-
bourne.
Nolan Retrospective. National Gallery
of Victoria, Melbourne.
NOT A HINT of commercialism lurks
ax’ound the 200-odd Nolan works now
on show in Melbourne; while Sydney
had three complementary shows of
Nolan’s later works most of them
for sale - two of Melbourne’s com-
mercial galleries concentrate on aspects
of Nolan’s origins, Tolamo’s 25 works
of the original Kelly series allowing
Melburnians to test Hal Missingham’s
preference, noted in the Retrospective
catalogue, for the 1951-56 Kellys as
incomparably finer pictures.
Certainly the later works are form-
ally simpler and metaphorically richer;
the earlier works are more anecdotal
and diffuse and unfold their narratives
in much the same way as the late 36ft.-
long panels; one notes that the later
Kellys are most intensely structured,
but a reviewing of the early works re-
veals the diversity of the Kellys: only
12 show Kelly as Kelly and if, as Robert
Melville says, the helmet “is always
the most sharply visible thing in the
painting,” it’s often not there at all,
and sometimes when the helmet-icon
appears, as in The Picnic, it is lost in
the light, thin, lyrical touch that one
sees again in the Roberts —like Lake
Wabby of 1947 at Strines and in the
pinkish landscape of Escaped Convict
of 1962, owned by the Art Gallery of
N.S.W. What Nolan was doing was
combining Heidelbergian lyricism
and some of McGubbin’s dour pessim-
ism—with a Cezannesque but tattered
fragmentation; to this mixture the
master added wit and tragedy; there
is tragedy as the gloomy hills enclose
Sherritt and his fading bride and as
the horse falls for ever in The Slip,
and there’s wit when the whole land-
scape seems to dissolve around the
naked Kelly “hiding” in the dam or
in the cherry wallpaper, Constable Fitz-
gerald’s sparkling spurs, and the table-
cover’s tassels all light grace notes
while Kelly looms small, but menac-
ingly, outside the window.
Nolan says he painted these with
Rousseau and sunlight, but one is-
struck by the darkness of the paintings;
certainly the reproductions in Melville’s
book are too bright Landscape and”
Quilting the Armor are positively
gloomy, and, strangely enough, the levi-
tation in the two works dealing with
the shooting of the constables is offset
by a compact, intense structure, so-

different from the pale, bleached land-
scapes with upside-down birds of 1948.
It’s a sweet sadness presaged by the
small grey painting of the Kelly family
in a cart driven by a constable at
Strines where one is surprised by
Nolan’s divergent interests. While he
paints loose landscapes he is also trap-
ping images in the portrait of Kelly
and of Barrie Reid in 1947 in Victorian
oval frames; these ovals appear in a
tree in an early Bracefell and Mrs.
Frazer painting and as holes in a most
odd painting of 1945, where the land-
scape is seen in one half through ovals
in solid paint and the police occupy a
conventional landscape in the other
half. It is an early stereoscopic device
that he uses in Strines’ St. Kilda Beach
Scene and in the Retrospective’s Flour-
lumper of 1943. Of course, with Nolan
it is never mere formalism, and what
unites these works is the whimsy of
the stripes on the beach towel, which
reappear on the tiger on the sack of
flour.
We have none of the early collages
here to settle questions of what ab-
straction meant to Nolan in 1938 and
1939, but we do have the remarkable
Moonboy of 1939 of a yellow ochre
champignon on dark blue, almost as
hard-edged and as minimal as anything
around; and it is interesting to note
how formal shape was succumbing to
expressionism in 1943 with a mauve-grey
soldier’s face accelerating the linear dis-
tortions of his slouch hat and how the
yellowed face in Morning Mass dies
behind a veil of bars that appear later
as twisted sinews in Kelly’s neck and
the hides of cattle’s carcasses. In be-
tween these and five drawings of
Kelly’s head, one in a stigmata-spot-
ted mask, all looking crazed and
savage, comes that magnificent paint-
ing, Rosa Mutabilis of 1945, with a
girl transformed into a white-flowered
bush against a lush, flowing green.
The splendid and spacious hanging
of the Retrospective brings out qualities
of Nolan’s work missed in Sydney’s
confined areas; we see the Queens-
land paintings of 1948 and those of
The Centre of 1949 as true panoramas,
the shifting horizon lines in the latter
alone a fascinating study, and those who
feel like it may raise the question of
how aesthetic qualities are enhanced
by seeing paintings in series. Nolan’s
three 36ft.-long works that enclosed
us in Sydney looked better there, but
the hanging of the African works in a
circular room, where the creatures
flickeringly encircle one, the revelation
of the development of the Gallipoli
works and the Leda series, and the
claustrophobic encroachment of the
carcasses are brilliantly staged.
No one in Melbourne or in reach of
that city should miss these shows or
that which follows at Tolarno on 30th
November: 26 lithographs ($260 to
$2250) by Toulouse-Lautrec; caric-
atures, satires, penetrating portraits,
profound or witty, frivolously economic
or harshly and accumulatively trench-
ant, with lines like daggers or cob-
webs, they are an inexhaustible delight.
Television
Straight men
By FRANK ROBERTS
DURING THE PAST two weeks much
of our world has turned upside down,
and most of it happened on or because
of television. The big event remained
the Senate election, 'because Britain’s
devaluation affected the candidates and
their campaigns more quickly than it
has affected our pockets.
What did the viewers see? An elec-
tion speech the Prime Minister delivered
as a sermon. No old-style clergyman be-
ing sent up in revue ever tried harder
to put the congregation to sleep. By
the time Mr. Holt reached his “com-
ing of age” speech on Britain’s devalu-
ation, the only flicker of interest was
in wondering who told Harold not to
smile on television, and will the full
story ever come out.
Gough Whitlam used television to
its limits. It was an over-produced job,


reminiscent in setting and choreography
of the late Eric Baume in those shows
supposed to have been shot in his
study. At times, and in its final effect,
it was laughable, but it had the im-
pact that anything visual and half-
way good had in comparison with
blankness.
Instead of saying how corny it
was, editorial writers throughout Aus-
tralia either ignored it or limited
their comment to the evaded Vietnam
issue, which proved them as unwise
about TV as the Government. Their
readers, if anyone reads stiff editorials
any more when you can see and assess
matters yourself on television, were then
free to do just that without fear that
anyone would tell them they had been
fooled.
Finally, in a moment he will long-
regret, Treasurer McMahon met Whit-
lam head on before the cameras and
two of those ineffectual interlocutors
who abound in Australia like couch
grass and gum saplings. The lights
seemed not only to dazzle McMahon
but also to stun him, and Whitlam had
the merriest game with him since Ken-
nedy put down Nixon.
McMahon, as he projected on to the
screen, was seething and querulous. No
one had told him, or he did not yet be-
lieve, that television is as dangerous
to a serious, crotchety person as a pad-
dock full of mad bulls. He had come
there to discuss Vietnam and Whitlam
refused to let him. They exchanged a
few words about scalps at one stage
and McMahon burst out, “They (the
ALP Senators) will get yours, Gough,
don’t worry.” All Whitlam had to do
was laugh heartily.
The Liberals are still playing the
game like gentlemen, but TV is not
Parliament, nor is it the hustings of
old. The rules are not parliamentary
rules, not even Queensberry, but prize-
ring rules.
The Government has no one with a
TV presence, except Anthony, who is
in the wrong party. Labor has several
better men. Two Sunday nights ago in
“Fighting Words” Senator Gorton
showed up as a non-starter, and one of
the “scalpers,” Senator Cohen, like-
wise. On his recent showing McMahon
w-ould have to try a Yul Brynner gam-
bit and also wear heavily rimmed
glasses, preferably tinted, to outrate
even a Cahvell on television.
All this reads like fantasy, even as
it is being written. Rather it is
prophecy. The Liberals may eventually
lose the country on television. They
have been told often enough about
TV’s searching eye, which can mag-
nify the best of men’s faults out of all
proportion, just as it can be used to
conceal those of a person wiio knows
how' to use it. Sad, but the truth of
the time. These days sincere comedians
may have more chance of election than
humorless straight men.
Turning Paddo into Paddington
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
THERE is Pro Plait’s “Grasshopper.”
With a multi-checked shirt hanging
over it. And a Henry Moore sculpture
with glasses stacked round it. Million-
aire Kym Bonython is standing by the
oriental garden, a feature of this new
art gallery of his, when the man who
designed it all, Stanley Langton, says
wouldn’t it happen, they’ve run out of
Sorbent.
The occasion is the opening of the
gallery. It’s so classy that John Arm-
strong, former Lord Mayor of Sydney,
who does the honors, says from now on
Paddo must be called Paddington.
Kym Bonython grins from ear to ear,
stands by $40,000 worth of Francis
Bacon, and says home is where the
heart is: his is where the art is—
Sydney. And Willie Wampfler, the
sound man, leaps forward to turn the
volume up. There are some here
tonight who won’t stop talking, they
should’ve put mikes all round the
room, that’s what.
What was once a chemical factory
is now 1 10 squares of private art gallery,
certainly the biggest in (guess what?)
the Southern Hemisphere, and it may
be, says Mr. Langton, gulping cham-
pagne, the biggest in the world. God,
you should’ve seen it this morning.
Frightful. The workman left only half
an hour before the opening and he was
fixing the lock on the ladies’ lavatory.
There were problems, all right, what
with sewerage pipes passing the front
door, but they got the whole thing done
in 13 weeks. The memory makes him
grab another glass.
Outside, the local population study
arrivals at this glittering $lO-a-ticket
black-tie event, all proceeds to the
N.S.W. Art Society. Six hundred
or so guests are here, the women modish
in an artistic way: Isobel Lee in the
biggest pink caftan of the year. Actress
Carmen Duncan shimmying around in
green culottes. Jane Cattlin, she designs
frantic fashion, in feathery pink with
a heart painted on her cheek. Well, if
she didn’t, everyone asks where’s it
gone? Mrs. Kym Bonython in gold
and pink brocade, bought in Dallas,"her
hair a fat plait which is very thing. Non-
thing girls wear bows.
“• ■ • if anyone calls me Andrea
again I’ll kill them,” says Andrena of
Adelaide radio.
“. . . I’m not Charles,” says James
Fairfax, “he’s the blond one with a
store somewhere.”
“. . . I mean, darl, just imagine
this place empty.”
“. . . Don’t you recognise that yel-
low nude?”
There is architect Harry Seidler
criticising the place and seven other
architects saying it’s superb. Phooey to
Seidler says Stanley Langton, and Mrs.
Langton says now perhaps Stan will
finish her kitchen. There is artist Ken
Reinhard wearing a psychedelic bow-
tie, the trad black caught in
his beard; and artist Mike Kitching
with hair shampoo’d in Johnson’s
baby soap. Someone gave him a
easeful. But what causes the biggest
stir of the evening is a girl in a see-
through chiffon dress, everyone hopes
she’s wearing a body-stocking.
Out in the courtyard caterers serve
supper, Don Burrows’ jazz group comes,
to life, and the champagne takes effect.
All around people ricochet with high-
piled plates and glasses, frenziedly
snatching seats at Kym Bonython’s
refectory tables. Mervyn Horton looms
from behind the willow tree and an-
nounces he is absolutely not going to
say anything quotable tonight, oh, my
God, he’s done it again. Why is it,
asks Brian Ettel.son the engineering
whizz in Formfit, and tonight in dark
glasses, why is it people cat so much

when they are out? He doesn’t want
a thing. He is mesmerised by a large
lady in pink stretching out for a large
handful of large prawns.
Half of Adelaide is here to see what
their boy has achieved. Lady Bonython
thinks of everything her son Kym has
done, submarines and all, what she’s
most proud of is his music. Max
Hutchinson from Gallery '‘A” leans on
Hepworth’s stringed “Spring” and says
other galleries may be jealous of all
this, to him it’s marvellous. Isn’t it,
Carl? Carl Plate, who’s got the big-
gest work hanging here tonight, it
takes up an entire wall, agrees.
There is also dancing. ABC’s Peter
Young crashes into $2OOO of “Rain on
the Dahlia Farm.” Mrs. Ken Rein-
hard does a fandango on the dais.
About one a.m., when it’s all finish-
ing, some classy Paddingtonian locals
lob in half-a-dozen rotten eggs at leav-
ing guests. The police say that sort of
thing can happen, even here.




BOOKS
Portrait of the artist
as a young shouter
By VINCENT BUCKLEY
The Education of Young Donald.
Donald Horne. Angus and Robert-
son. $3.95.
THIS MOST MOVING and illumina-
ting book reminds me why I will never
write an autobiography: the kind of
honesty required is both too exacting
and too devious. The problem is not
how to get “total recall,” in which Hal
Porter (the most obvious comparison)
is obviously superior to Horne; for
Horne is less interested in recalling than
in composing; the textures of the world
are less important to him than the
shape his own past can be induced to
take in the process of recasting his
society.
Nor is it only, or chiefly, a matter of
how to do justice to other people; in
this matter Horne is, on the whole,
admirably scrupulous. It is a matter of
how to do justice to oneself as a past
entity: to confess without breast-beat-
ing, to give an account of one’s past
energies without self-inflation, to ack-
nowledge divisions and confusions of
interest without seeming a manic-
depressive.
The interesting thing is that Horne
has done all .this so well, and that,
without falsifying his self-portrait, he
has built into his narrative several
devices for draining-off or diverting
nostalgia. It is in effect a portrait of the
observer as a young actor. “Sincere?”
Ah, no, thank God; it is too gamy for
that, too quirky, too overtly aware of
falsities, and too implicitly aware of
their consequences. The sincerity of
most men about their youth usually
tells to their own advantage in middle-
age. Horne is surely on firmer ground
in stressing what was self-regarding or
manic in his earlier behaviour, without
claiming for himself a present sincerity.
No one is so subjective as the reader
of an autobiography, not even its
writer. Personally I am most taken
with those parts of Horne’s work where
he deals with his early childhood in a
country town, and with his activities
at Sydney University in the early
’forties. In both matters his book is
a fascinating and important social docu-
ment. In the childhood scenes, Young
Donald is the chiel taking notes; and
he is himself the one to rue it; there
is no self-inflating infantilism here:
“When there were Sydney relatives
staying with us —my grandparents or
uncles and aunts —there was always a
lot of shouting and laughter over din-
ner. Sydney people were like that: they
shouted at dinner. I became a shouter
early. I remember once, when I was
aged eight or nine, running off to the
lavatory, which was at the bottom of
the backyard, and sitting there stub-
bornly while my grandfather stood out-
side and tried to persuade me to come
back and apologise to my grandmother
for whatever it was I had shouted over
dinner.”
The banality of this milieu is pre-
sented as neither depressing nor en-
dearing. How could it be, given the
author’s care to preserve a certain angle
of interest? The love he expresses goes
with the deliberate detachment which
he uses as the very means of its ex-
pression. He is not interested in past
deprivations or resentments. He is in-
terested in the shape of a past self. And
if the result has sometimes the flatness
of reportage, this, too, is a feature of
its honesty.
Even as a small child, he observed,
as many of us have done, the game of
life in which he participated; and now,
as a man, he observes his own observ-
ing self, estimating the country-town
ethos of “endurance, commitment, the
expression of will” in a land which
seemed “the land of the dogged ges-
ture.” His account of all this is in
itself a valuable corrective to what re-
mains of the myth of mateship; for
mateship was no part of the ethos which
he learned from his Anzac father.
But by far the most interesting part
of his narrative is that which deals with
his time at Sydney University: the rise
of Young Donald, his transformation
into D. R. Horne, the split between
these two selves in the heady glories
of student activities, and the educating
of Young Donald in and through the
downfall of D. R. Horne.
He went to University with much
brashness, a grounding in his father’s
ethos, bits of Darwinism and Marxism,
and an infatuation with the “Daily
Telegraph’s” long war on behalf of “in-
telligence against stupidity”—and with
a flair for disguising his lack of social
flair:
“Having already learned how to for-
get that my father had been in a men-
tal hospital, I now found it easy enough
also to forget that he had been a
government schoolteacher, or that I
had been to a government school, or
that I did not live in a good suburb.
I simply acted as if all this were not
so . .
Yes. And so it became easier to build
up the confidence to approach Professor
John Anderson, or A. D. Hope, or
(above all) James McAuley. He meets
the latter shortly after the hilarious
episode in which, having euphorically
undertaken to give a public talk on
“What’s Wrong with the Freethought
Society,” he decides in panic that he
knows nothing about the Freethought
Society, stays at home during the meet-
ing time, and later explains that his
absence “must have been a Freudian
slip.” The approach to McAuley is pre-
sented with gusto and the nostalgia of
hero-worship. McAuley was “J. Me,”
the poet of “the sad emptiness of met-
ropolitan youth,” but he was also
Jimmy the jazz pianist:
“He was placed below the stage, in
a dinner jacket, playing the piano,
undulating up and down on his seat
with the rhythm, his fair hair caught
by the stage lighting. I had gone to the
revue mainly to see McAuley, and I
left with the same urge I had felt with
Anderson: I must know this man
The urge, at that time, was to par-
ticipate in a myth already existing; the
urge, now, is to extend and rewrite a
myth already changed and blurred by
the fame of middle-age. Horne’s ac-
count of McAuley and Hope is brilliant
throughout; but his account of his own
attraction toward them is even better.
It is an extreme case of the devotion
to becoming initiated. And Horne does
become initiated, accepted: everywhere,
and too readily:
“I wanted to be all things. I wanted
to think everything, first this, then
that, to exercise myself in contradic-
tions and to do it all at once get
moving. In the Philosophy Room, An-
derson was right. In the Quad, McAuley
was right. In the pub, Conlon was
right.”
The comic irony of that is splendid.
He got moving, all right. He became a
man-about-student-clubs, boozer, de-
bater, holder-forth, pundit: D. R.
Horne, in short. A very young D. R.
Horne, of course, because there were
many ways of the world he still did
not know. But he was on the way to
becoming what such a “celebrity” often
becomes—editor of the student news-
paper, which is, for some types, the
necessary crown of all their undirected
excitements:
“My attack on Holburn had
launched me as a notorious person and


a Quadrangle celebrity. There had been
no plan to attack him—it was just last-
minute debater’s ad-libbing . . . but now-
people were suggesting that I had done
it deliberately to get publicity. How
tiresomely stupid they were! I was
naturally provocative. But, excited by
all this, 1 picked up gossip about myself
and enjoyed exposing its absurdities.”
Where better to do this than in the
editor’s chair? To the editor’s chair,
then. You can create gossip and excite-
ment about yourself there. The pages
devoted to the getting and bouncing
there (chapters IX and X) are to me
the most fascinating of all. Anyone
concerned with the present morale of
Australian universities should read, in
particular, pages 298 to 319. There are
enough lessons there to last anyone a
triennium.
The young editor provokes, bullies,
cheats, deceives himself with grand
accesses of indignation, patronises, log-
rolls. On page 313 he tells how he pub-
lished a deliberately misleading head-
line, and on page 312 mentions how
“The Vice-Chancellor called me in for
afternoon tea to tell me how success-
fully he had resisted demands from
outside religious and women’s groups
that I should be expelled. With
audacity, one could achieve anything.”
Yet he could still, in those accesses
of righteous indignation, assure himself
that he had no ambition, was con-
temptuous of the notion of a career,
did not desire political influence, was
not interested in power. At the same
time, “However trivial a. source of
power, it can provide the same plea-
sures as the greatest office.” Among
these is the discovery that “one can
take over the very policies on which
one’s predecessor has been defeated,”
and the lesson that “there was nothing
that, if I was bold enough, I could not
now do.” He “dreamed of Alcibiades,
betrayed one side, then another, then
another.”
For a university this mixture of
cynical realism and fantasy is as terrify-
ing as Horne’s present account of it
is exhilarating. And the lessons thus
learnt include the lesson that it must
all end.
It ends for D. R. Horne and Young
Donald together in a final orgy of
manic self-assertion in which he gets
the sack from “Honi Soit.” A splendidly
energetic consummation for his “story,
funny and sad.”
It should be clear why I think the
book is important both as a sociologi-
cal document of a. kind quite new to
this country and as a livre compose
concerned not so much with reminis-
cences or recall- as with the composition
of a personal past which,
may compose also the society in which
it happened. And happened is the
operative word. The honesty of this
work is measured not by a sombre
revaluatory tone (which people often
call sincerity) but by the energy that
goes into that labor of composition.
Force of actuality
By DAVID McGILL
On Trial: Edited by Leopold Labedz
and Max Hayward. Collins. $5.30.
AS A TRIAL IT IS unique in history;
as a mistrial it was as sensational as
the Dreyfus affair, as significant as the
Tennessee “monkey trial,” as tragic as
the arraignment of Oscar Wilde. This
book is the only published record so
far of this trial, in February, 1966, of
the distinguished literary critic Andrey
Sinyavsky, and the translator, Yuli
Daniel, who are now serving sentences
of seven and five years in hard-labor
camps for publishing abroad, under the
pseudonyms “Abram Tertz” and “Niko-
lai Arzhak,” works judged to be anti-
Soviet. Writers have been ostracised,
put on trial, exiled, jailed, shot
they have not previously been tried for
what they have written. When these two
writers defiantly pleaded “Not guilty”
they forced into the open the position
of the Soviet State toward freedom of
expression. In this book Soviet justice
is on trial, and it is found wanting; the
book records the internal and interna-
tional protests which have asserted that
Soviet law erred and has thereby done
those it serves a grave disservice.
The first part of the book deals with
the background and pre-trial investiga-
tion. Editor Max Hayward, translator
of modern Russian literature, includ-
ing the two authors on trial, introduces
the people and the ground covered.
Madame Helene Zamoyska, a French
student at Moscow University and long-
time friend of Sinyavsky, gives a pic-
ture of the man’s warmth and dedi-
cation to Communism and the reasons
why he and Daniel asked her to get
their fictional works published abroad.
Letters by Mrs. Sinyavsky and Mrs.
Daniel, unpublished by the Russian
newspapers they were sent to, give a
chilly, Kafkaesque account of the arbi-
trary intrusions and unexplained actions
of the authorities. A protest letter to
Kosygin tells of student demonstrations
at the arrests, still unreported in the
newspapers. The Soviet people first
learn of the arrests in articles reprinted
here from “Izvestia” and the “Literary
Gazette,” articles smearing the writers
and presupposing their guilt. Eight of
the defences of Sinyavsky and Daniel
are reprinted here, four of them letters
the Soviet Press would not publish, four
submissions for the defence but not
admitted by the court.
Plumb in the centre of the book is
the remarkable 132-page transcript of
the trial, a document that has reached
the West by undisclosed channels. One
of the 150 carefully vetted people in
the court took down this unofficial
record. It opens with the indictment on
the grounds of slander and subversion.
Daniel, the first to be examined, is
witty and self-deprecatory but a little
uncertain under the impatient question-
ing of the prosecutor. He explains that
the Public Murder Day declared by the
central authorities in one of his stories
is a literary device by which to study
people’s reactions. He says that when he
wrote the story in 1961, Khrushchev
seemed to be reviving Stalin’s cult of
personality.
“Prosecutor: ‘You’re slandering again,
Sinyavsky.’
“Daniel (half-bowing): ‘My name
is Daniel.’ ”
Under examination, Sinyavsky speaks
with scholastic precision, sharply dis-
missing foolish questions, uncompromis-
ing in his answers. The court drama
focuses on him. The judge, the prose-
cutor, the public accusers (who had
earlier published denunciations of both
authors), ridicule Sinyavsky and indig-
nantly accuse him of ridiculing Lenin.
Sinyavsky staunchly defends himself.
The court seems determined to convict.
Sympathetic witnesses are quickly dis-
missed. As the trial progresses, the rift
widens between the defendants’ attempts
to explain that satire is literary exag-
geration, but they do not hold the views
of their characters, and the court’s
obsession with the minimal use their
writings have been put to as anti-Soviet
Sinyavsky (front) and Daniel... pall-
bearers to Pasternak
propaganda, repeatedly quoting out of
context to support its presuppositions.
In their final pleas, Sinyavsky bitterly
complains about this inability to com-
municate and Daniel hotly rebuffs the
literal interpretations of the court.
The aftermath section presents the
contrasting statements of official
approval and individual protests against
the sentences. In an epilogue, Leopold
Labedz describes the present suffering
of the writers. This makes the four
memoirs by French friends which
follow very affecting, particularly in
the emphasis on the writers’ love of
their motherland and its culture. Frank
Kermode writes a literary appreciation
of Sinyavsky’s satirical fantasies.

The book is exhaustive and a little
exhausting. The editors have presented
all the evidence, in view of which it is
difficult to see why in their introduction
and epilogue they should haVe sum-
marised so much of the material in
between; the book is inevitably repeti-
tive as it is. But there is no question
of its impact. It is dominated by the
courage of the two trail-blazers and the
inspiration it has been to their fellow
Soviet intellectuals.
The trial document has the force of
actuality, the inevitability of Greek
drama, the drama of conflict between
literary and legal minds. Indirectly, the
book is a history of dissenting literature
in Russia and an important document
on internal changes in Soviet society
—because of this trial the fight for free-
dom of expression is now an open clash.
It is appropriate that Sinyavsky and
Daniel were pall-bearers at the funeral
of Pasternak, who never licked the
boots of Stalin or his successors, and
who was rehabilitated in June of this
year.
No circus
By NANCY KEESING
An Affair of Clowns. Thelma Forshaw.
Angus & Robertson. $2.50.
THELMA FORSHAW EXPLORES
two city worlds for her very good short
stories and sketches. One world •
it supplies the longest and strongest
section of this book is the seedy,
raffish, boozy, SP, Catholic, working-
class world of a lively but not over-
well-educated family seen through the
eyes of a child, who, as the stories pro-
gress, grows to adolescence. (As noted
in The Bulletin last week, the family
stories, which form a sequence, “Some
Customs of My Clan,” were originally
part of a novel the writer abandoned.)
Mother, a widow with “followers,”
stands firmly central on “little freckled
legs and funny, childish feet.” She
can be shrill, capricious, unfair, or
subtle when her voice is “as slithery
as a snake’s belly moving over the
floor.” There are marvellous aunts
they drink, squabble, pinch linen
from houses they work in, and spend
Saturday afternoon listening to the
races. There are uncles failures and
magnificent, or failures and merely re-
formed. There are squabbles, yearn-
ings, nuns from the convent school,
lovers, and always a little girl obsessed
with notions of a better life, of writ-
ing poetry, of Love and Romance bear-
ing no resemblance to what she observes
in mean streets and noisy, kalsomined
ugliness.
This girl is a great “self-improver.”
She devours articles about clothes, cos-
metics, manners, as well as any and
every speck of good literature which
might accidentally come her way. She
has a saving sense of humor “As
well as being a ‘lady’ I am also some-
thing of a pugilist” and some of
her adventures (as in “The Procurer”)
are funny and sad and deftly presented
enough for valid comparison with
classics of their genre such as “Red-
heap.”
Miss Forshaw’s other world exists
in the same Sydney streets and suburbs,
but now its inhabitants are immigrants
—chicken farmers, milk-bar owners, and
the Australians who work with, for,
or near them. The author has a keen
ear for nuances of pronunciation and
phrase, and this short bracket of stories,
although presented almost flippantly,
makes a more profound statement about
meetings of cultures and nationalities
than some other, more seriously writ-
ten work one can recall.
Of but apart from these worlds is the
group called “Outsiders.” Of these,
three, “The Brave and the Free,” “Wear
an Albatross for Me,” and “The Break-
through,” are less satisfying than others
in the book mainly because they at-
tempt far more. The two which explore
lesbian characters are timely, honest,
and indicate that if only short-story
writers had more encouragement to
produce their work today Miss For-
shaw might develop a really powerful
body of work. As it is, her part failure
is, I think, a defect of style. Here the
writing is too akin to the flippant,
amusing mode which suited those other
two worlds so well.
This is not to suggest that humor,
irony, and even farce are out of place
when themes of this type are used, but
in these examples the voice behind the
tale is at variance with what is hap-
pening, and the progress of the. writing
gains, for this reason, a jerky, forced
effect.
Hitler's children
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Into a Neutral Country. Hugo Wolf-
ram. Longmans. $5.65.
THE MAIN PIVOT of this unusual
first novel is a macabre joke which the
author ironically put into the mouth
of one of his characters, Dr. Arndt, a
distinguished psychoanalyst: “It would
make a good cartoon . . . you know,
of Feiffer’s sort . . the patient tells
a psychiatrist he has murdered a
woman, one of his mother-substitute
figures; the doctor says he only
imagines it; so the patient opens a cup-
board and the body falls out.
Peter Bennett (born Pietro Caruana)
is the murderer of “Into a Neutral
Country” whose confession no one
wants to believe. By tracing his life-
story, Hugo Wolfram explores a com-
plex and disturbing theory that
every displaced person and persecuted
refugee from Nazism is a potential
psychiatric case and is still today a
possible danger to society.
According to the author, Hitler trans-
ferred the usually imaginary world of
the paranoiac into a concrete reality.
He set up concentration camps that
were factual projections of his own fan-
tasies and manias. In this way, he also
exposed the inmates themselves to the
equivalent of mental disturbances. Con-
sequently, even years afterwards, given
the necessary trigger-point, any of these
apparently normal rehabilitated citizens-
may run amok and break out with a
crime of senseless violence.
As World War II begins the child
Pietro Caruana, an Italian Catholic, is
stranded in a Jewish household in Hol-
land. He and his young “sister,” the
Dutch girl Ruth Blumenthal, pass from
the horrors of concentration camps to
the DP camps, to escape to Switzer-
land and finally adoption by different
English families. As Peter Bennett,
young Pietro wins high distinction at
Oxford and marries an English intel-
lectual. Instead of reading a paper to
a University International Refugee
Year Conference and then attending a
party in his honor, he suddenly gives
himself up at Oxford police station for
the murder of a Viennese prostitute.
Much of the novel takes place on the
psychoanalyst’s couch, where Dr. Arndt
tries unsuccessfully to bring Pietro’s
warring “id” and Peter’s new “super-
ego” into the harmonious neutral
country of the title. But it is often dif-
ficult to know whether the author is
running with the psychoanalytical
hares, led by what he calls Professor
Joy of the Vienna Woods, or hunting
with the opposing hounds who either
pooh-pooh the consultant’s couch or
find it downright dangerous.
The novel ingeniously keeps one
guessing till the final chapter by using
a sort of whodunit technique and
jumping backwards and forwards in
time. The style is deliberately popular.

Tears and laughter
The Making of Charles Dickens. Chris-
topher Hibbert. Longmans. $5.65.
DICKENS WAS A MAN who could
not forget or forgive his childhood, who
was neurotically sensitive about him-
self; and if he had not been so, if he
had forgiven and forgotten, it would
have been a tragedy for English litera-
ture.
As a young boy in a large family,
Charles is not noticed for anything
remarkable; but Charles does not miss
a thing. The boy was able to hoard
just about every experience he had;
over the years it was enlarged and
eventually published in its embroidered
version. The only stories that match
what Dickens was to write were the
horrendous bedtime tales of his nurse,
like the bloodthirsty fates of the num-
erous brides of Captain Murderer.
The extraordinary sensitivity of
Dickens magnified what must have
been standard childhood disappoint-
ments. Mr. Hibbert shows that in his
bitter reactions to leaving school his
father’s financial problems and his six
months of drudgery in a boot-blacking
factory were the seeds of Dickens’
social criticism, sentimentality, snob-
bery, vanity, pity for orphans, and
mawkish self-pity. When he returns to
school Charles bounces up as a gay
show-off, his only concern to keep his
shameful working-class past a secret
from his schoolmates. Dickens is seen
as a bored and cheeky lawyer’s clerk,
an incredibly active reporter, a pas-
sionate theatregoer and amateur actor,
a handsome dandy helplessly in lov.e,
hopelessly in despair when snubbed.
Once Dickens is famous as a writer,
Mr. Hibbert speeds up the biography:
marriage to the dull and amiable
Catherine Hogarth, his wild love for
her sister and inconsolable grief at her
sudden death; quarrels with publishers,
straining like a draught-horse under
the massive self-imposed workload, his
stormy literary friendships. His vitality,
eccentricity, and wife-baiting he trans-
mutes into the person of Mr. Quilp in
“The Old Curiosity Shop;” everything
is fodder, and he alternates between
tears and laughter as he re-creates
everything in his novels.
Ward 8
The Pleasure Factory. Valeriy Tarsis.
Collins. $3.70.
TWO YEARS AGO, Valeriy Tarsis
caused something of an international
sensation with “Ward 7,” a novel based
on his experiences as a highly dubious
inmate of a Moscow mental asylum.
Flis madness seems mainly to have
consisted of his desire not unknown
among authors to have his works
published, if not in his own country,
which had been turning them all down
since 1939, then in another.
Tarsis has lived in the West since
1966 but “The Pleasure Factory,”
now published for the first time, is
one of the works he wrote while
still in the Soviet Union. The book
starts off well. Nastasya is a heroine
in the grand manner, a Russian “Car-
men” whose fate is no less enthralling
for being obvious from the first word.
As the story opens she is already
tiring of her weak obsessed lover,
Stephen, and soon meets her “Tore-
ador” in a worldly French journalist.
Part I is the most successful portion
of the novel because it is dominated
throughout by Nastasya’s fiery, mag-
netic personality. Her role in the other
two sections is fleeting and episodic
and this is a major mistake. One
cannot let a figure like this loose and
then put it on ice while plunging
into little pictures of ordinary life in-
terspersed with great slabs of soapbox
oratory, only to return briefly to dis-
pose of the dead body on the last
page.
The other inhabitants of “The
Pleasure Factory,” the apt name for
the Black Sea holiday resort in which
the novel is set, are all interesting
enough sociologically in their own
small-town way and their little lives
reveal some fascinating glimpses into
the average Soviet citizen’s outlook on
anything from women to the local
Party.
Originally conceived to follow on in
the tradition of the great Russian
novelists of the past, the lack of pro-
portion and balance makes the whole
work less monumental than it could
have been. The writing is fine in parts
but it is insufficiently welded into one.
When it strives hardest to sound
Dostoevskian it only manages to pro-
duce miniatures, unevenly strung to-
gether with lots of stylish bumps (if
we can believe the translation). At
the end it lapses lamely into the old
time-worn diary-form. Was it perhaps
rushed into publication before it was
quite ready? If so, it is simply a
casualty of the tidal wave of print
that has marked the year of the 50th
Anniversary of the Russian Revolu-
tion.
Ikebana

Norman Sparnon. Ure Smith. $7.95.

tionist.
However, that is, of course, only the
view of an uninitiate. Otherwise, Nor-
man Sparnon’s book, beautifully pre-
sented with 96 handsome color pages,
would hardly have found a place on
Ure Smith’s sparse list.


CONNOISSEUR
TABLE WINES
NOTES FROM LINDEMAN'S
CELLAR MANAGER
Table wine making has a recorded
history of thousands of years, and
basically the process today is identi-
cal to that depicted by the Egyptians
on their ancient monuments. Modern
science has yet to revolutionise our
time-honoured practices, although, of
course, enormous effort has been
spent on how to produce a matured
dry red, etc., in under twelve months.
The greatest advance in total wine
making took place several hundred
years ago, with the introduction of
cork to seal wine containers, thus
allowing wine for the first time to
attain bottle maturity. Less than one
hundred years ago sulphur dioxide
was introduced to wine making,' en-
suring higher quality general wines
through its anti - bacteriological
properties. Modern science has helped
the winemaker understand what hap-
pens and how, but with dry reds
nothing new has been invented, and
our techniques could still be com-
pletely understood by the Egyptians.
In the case of dry-white winemaking
however, modern science has contri-
buted enormously. New and better
types of white table wine are regu-
larly being marketed, thanks solely to
science.
One such development is the
“sterile” bottling line, so highly
efficient that fermenting grape juice
can be filtered and bottled without
fear of subsequent re-fermentation in
the bottle. The deliberate retention
of a little grape sugar in the wine
is therefore possible, and “moselle”
style whites are now commonplace.
The plant also allows the extremely
early bottling of all dry whites. It
has been found that these young
wines are extremely attractive and
popular due to their freshness and
grapey character, and better still,
that wines so bottled live much longer
in bottle.

MASTER
Adding spice to
the enjoyment of
good white wines
RECENTLY WE ORGANISED a
tasting of Traminers to examine the
styles of the local and overseas pro-
ducts. The wines were gathered from
private cellars, wine and spirit mer-
chants, and two or three of the largest
Australian wine companies.
The Traminer is a favorite grape,
variety in the Alsace region of France,
of course, but it is not the favorite.
This is reserved for the Rhine Riesling.
There also seems to be some con-
fusion over the distinction between
Traminer and Gewurztraminer.
Traminer is the grape variety. Some
time ago, if a particularly good wine
was made it earned the prefix
“Gewurz,” meaning spicy. Nowadays,
nearly all the wine is called by the
longer name, and they use the shorter
name only if the wine is lacking.
We’ve had small patches of the
variety in this country for some time.
Lately, because of the success of some
of the wines made from it in shows,
and because cuttings are being released
after lengthy quarantine in South Aus-
tralia, there has been much interest
in the variety which will undoubtedly
lead to wider use.
The first thing we found was that
there are two completely different
styles in this country. Whether this is
entirely due to different soils and
climates or to winemaking procedures
would be difficult to say. The McWil-
liam’s Mount Pleasant Traminers were
basically Hunter Valley whites with a
distinct varietal flavor. The Penfold’s
wines had all the aromatic qualities of
those from overseas.
McWilliam’s have a fairly large patch
of Traminer above the winery on the
hill at Mount Pleasant, and have been
making separate wines for years. It
appears that they do not show to
advantage when bottled, and need a
couple of years or so to settle down
and harmonise. Then they acquire a
splendid honeyed character. This
doesn’t imply sweetness in wine terms,
but a sort of nutty, mellowed, faintly
nectar-smelling quality. Honeyed. To
me this is often more appealing than
a developed straight Semilion.
Of the wines we tasted, the ’67 was
a good wine, contradicting the bottle-
sickness bit, but then it had been
hardly minutes in the bottle. The ’66
and ’65 were somewhat baggy and
unbalanced, the ’64 good with a
delicate fruitiness and flavor, the ’63,
’62, and ’6l all slightly disappointing.
There was a slight flabbiness in a
couple and an aggressive acid in an-
other. All three benefited by being
open for a while. The ’6O I quite liked,
the flavor and style still developing.
The ’59 was a humdinger. A lovely
flavor and character, good 'balance, soft
fetching nose, all the right words.
Could drink lots of it. "The ’5B was
good, too, but not quite as. The ’57
was the favorite of many present. I
liked it, but thought it was still a bit
too firm. Of the older ones the ’53
was the best, having a very clean
fresh acid that had obviously kept
the whole thing together. The ’54,
’47, and ’43 were all wonderful old
wines that were showing their age,
but still had tremendous flavor and
quality.
So much for the Mount Pleasants.
Some magnificent wines, the best of
all being of definite White Burgundy
style. More Hunter wines than strong
varietal wines, though you could spot
that they weren’t the usual Hunter
whites.
The Penfold’s wines were quite dif-
ferent. They have had Traminer at
Minchiribury for many years, and more
recently a good patch at the South-
ridge vineyard nearby. I have read
of their famous Trameahs of the
’twenties from these areas and have
taken suitable note. Then almost noth-
ing for quite a while until brilliant
wine-maker Max Schubert arrived on
the scene and helped sort things out.
This resulted in the ’6O Trameah, their
trade name for the Traminer, which
today shows big and fat but which,
when young, was very good indeed. The
’6l was acid and slight; this was not
a good year in N.S.W. Then came the
famous ’62.
This wine had everything. A strong
aromatic nose redolent of the grape,
a very full powerful flavor and a crisp
clean finish. Wonderfully balanced and
having that hard-to-describe quality of
finesse. You can smell and savor and
taste in abundance, yet nothing is
coarse or out of place, every com-
ponent is integrated and adds up to
a terrific series of sensations.
The wine is still superb. It has won
pages of advertised medals and no
doubt will win lots more. The ’64
was showing slight fullness while re-
taining a lovely perfumed nose, and
the ’66 was almost as good as the ’62,
being very delicate and balanced. All
splendid wines.
Because of the scarcity of the
material, Penfold’s decided to blend
it with top-quality Rhine Riesling of
the same style and character. This
resulted in ’6l in the Bin 177 Traminer
Riesling. Next year the number was
202 and after that they stuck to the
same number. All the wines of this
line were good when young. But as

they get older the Rhine Riesling seems
to assert itself more and takes over.
So my advice is to drink them young
when the full aromatic quality and
pungency is at its best. The ’67 is
the best wine of the line, and is now
available. The appeal is in the lightness
and the fragrance and the flavor.
Other interesting local wines were
the Lindemans Bin 2750 ’65 Traminer
Riesling, a blend of Traminer and
Hunter Riesling picked and fermented
together, a fine wine, typical of their
whites, but not necessarily a. strong
varietal wine, and the ’66 Griffith
Traminer. This was from the Viticul-
tural Station run by Alan Murray, and
came off about eight vines. The pro-
nounced character it had when young
has gone, but we shall hear a lot more
of these wines from this area.
The Alsatian wines were disappoint-
ing. The best wine of this tasting was
made by L. Humbrecht of Wintzen-
heim, a maker with vineyards up and
down the Haut-Rhin section of the
Alsace. Others of note were the Louis
Sipp ’66 from Ribeauville, of good
style but a little lacking in flavor, a
Priess ’65 which had lovely balance,
and a Cornaz ’64 from Riquewihr
which was a little lacking in nose but
had a good palate. The only named
Traminer, all the others being Gewurz-
traminers, was lacking in every way.
The spiciness is difficut to des-
cribe, but you soon know what it
means when you taste. It’s a sort of
edgy bite to the floweriness of the
nose, a hint of spice in fact, and a
peppery quality on the back of the
palate. Go and buy a bottle,
Now for conclusions. The Mount
Pleasants are not overseas-style Trami-
ners, but are top whites in their own
right. The Penfold’s wines are very
close to Alsatian style, and the best
of them were better than the im-
ported. I would prefer to drink the ’67
202 Traminer Riesling rather than
the others of the same style. In spite
of the blending, it is in short supply,
Australian wines, whites especially,
have suffered in the past from lack of
nose. They simply haven’t smelled as
nice as many from other top coun-
tries. In recent years we have over-
come this to some extent. The Tram-
iner variety helps enormously, for a
strong and perfumed nose is one of
its characteristics.
Yet I do not think it the ultimate
answer. I still think Rhine Riesling
will make the best Hock-style wine in
this country. Still better grape growing
and handling and advanced wine-
making will result in even better Rhine
Rieslings than we are getting now.
The Traminer will be a most wel-
come addition if it becomes more freely
available, and I do hope we see far
more of it. But, as in the Alsace, it
will eventually play second violin to
Rhine Riesling,
I didn’t say fiddle because both are
far too elegant.
LETTERS
Making use of the CMF
Peter Samuels’ article “One Hundred
Thousand Soldiers” was valuable in
pointing up the need for a more realis-
tically sized Army. Our credit rating
in this part of the world is going to
depend largely on the effectiveness of
our defence forces in the next couple
of decades.
Whether we can increase our nine-
battalion Army to two and a half
times its size in ten years is another
matter. Mr. Samuels put his finger
on the problem when he pointed to
the shortage of officers and NCOs
which already exists. It seems optimis-
tic to suggest that this increase will be
possible while middle-grade officers are
even now in short supply and bearing
in mind that many of the World War
II men are on the verge of retire-
ment. Candidates for promotion to
major in ten years’ time will have to
come from the young lieutenants who
are graduating from the officer schools
now. Whether sufficient of them will
survive normal wastage to maintain a
three-division Army, without losing
quality, seems doubtful. The National
Service officer may be another source
of supply, but there will have to be
fundamental changes in public attitude
to a career in the armed forces for
one-fifth of all NS officers to sign on.
Likewise, the idea that, out of the
proposed one hundred thousand, sixty
percent will still be regular soldiers
suggests that somehow the number of
young men volunteering for the Regu-
lar Army will double in the next ten
years. In our affluent society, I can
see no reason for this assumption.
Unless, once again, the incentives
or moral obligations for service
suddenly become greater than they are
at the moment.
While agreeing fundamentally with
Mr. Samuels on the need for a three-
division Army, this may, in fact, have
to be achieved in a different way. The
generalisation that the CMF would
take six months to prepare needs
qualifying; in fact, the whole tenor
of his closing paragraph is open to
challenge.
The quality of units in the CMF
varies, but many, including engineers,
artillery, and armor, could be made
ready in much less time. The main
obstacle to quick mobilisation would
be lack of equipment rather than skill.
The officer examinations for the CMF
are now at virtually the same, stan-
dard as for the Regular Army, and the
man who can pass them, while still
attending to his civilian career, must


compare very favorably with his regu-
lar counterpart.
There is no great obstacle to the
use of the CMF in a major defence
expansion in the ways suggested.
Units and formations could serve full-
time if needed, for remember that
all of them are volunteers. There
would have to be protection for their
jobs and civilian promotion at least as
good as those provided for the Nat-
ional Serviceman, which at present they
don’t have. Units could be warned and
equipped in advance to prepare them-
selves for use as strategic reserves or
as part of the regular force serving
overseas.
A Citizen Army is as good as the
time and effort put into it. In Israel,
reserve units composed wholly of citi-
zen soldiers were mobilised and wait-
ing on the start line within 36 hours
of receiving the call-up. Their sub-
sequent performance is well known.
Having seen both theirs and ours, I
cannot say that our CMF material is
in any way inferior.

Australia's defences
Replying to the letter by J. Cam-
van (8., Nov. 11), “perhaps the Fill
meets the specifications singly, but is
its range at supersonic speeds sufficient
for world-wide deployment? Can it
carry a heavy weapon and/or bomb
load to the target at supersonic speeds?
Was it designed essentially for nuclear
bombs when used in the bomber role?
What is the ‘very short notice’ to
deploy mobile radar units? Is it con-
ceivable that in any theatre in which
the RAAF will have to fight that air
superiority will depend upon the
RAAF? What conceivable connection is
there between the performance of the
short-ranged Mirage in the Arab-
Israel conflict and Australia’s defence
problem?”
I don’t know if the Fill’s range at
supersonic speeds is sufficient for world-
wide deployment, but I know it’s suf-
ficient for deployment in Asia, where
they’ll be used. We can assume safely
that the Fill can carry a heavy weapon
and/or bomb load to the target at
supersonic speeds because everybody
tells us it can, and because that’s one
of the reasons why the RAAF ordered
it. The BFIII of the USAF Strategic
Air Command was designed essentially
for nuclear weapons. Since the FIIIC
that we’re getting is similar to the
BFIII, we, too, can assume that it
can carry nuclear weapons. The “very
short notice” to deploy radar units are
the two “Hubcap” radar units ordered
nearly two years ago, and which can
be transported by the Hercules. It is
conceivable that in any theatre in which
the RAAF will have to fight that air
superiority will depend on the RAAF.
This will be particularly true in the
future now that the British are pulling
out of Malaysia and with an almost
certain American withdrawal from Asia
when the war in Vietnam finishes. The
connection between the performance of
the Mirage in the Israeli-Arab conflict
and Australia’s defence problems is that
we’ve got Mirages in our Air Force,
like the Israelis though ours have
a better performance. In the Arab-
Israeli War the Israeli Mirages had no
difficulty in shooting down the MIG2Is.
Therefore, I think it is safe to assume
that our Mirages are the best intercep-
tors in South-East Asia, excluding, per-
haps, British and American aircraft;
and they will be able to shoot down
any MIG2Is when someone has a
stoush with us.
Why can’t we get military aid from
the United States? The Koreans send
troops to South Vietnam and get more
money in military aid from the Ameri-
cans than it’s costing them to keep
those troops there and get praised
for it from an American Governmental
Committee. Thailand is to send more
troops there and get military aid. Aus-
tralia and New Zealand send more
troops without receiving any aid in
return and get abused for not sending
more troops even though we’ve got half
our infantrymen overseas. Therefore,
why can’t we get military aid from
America, e.g., an attack carrier and
some more Fills? Many Americans
are saying we should do more in Viet-
nam because of the ANZUS Treaty.
But treaties are two-way affairs, so
shouldn’t the U.S. do something more
positive to help our armed forces? I
think the Government should seriously
think over this question.
The Bulletin wants to see us with
100,000 soldiers, and so do I. One
way to make this possibility much
easier would be to get the Gurkhas from
the British. Since there are four regi-
ments there would be at least four
battalions, thereby multiplying our
infantry strength by half. This would
release experienced NCOs and officers
in Malaysia to help the training of an
expanding Army back here. Another
way to get more men would be to start
a Foreign Legion. As well as the
British, the French and the Germans
are cutting down the strength of their
military forces a good source of
recruitment there. When the Americans
get out of Vietnam they will prune
down the Army and we could get
many jungle-experienced officers and
men. The main source of recruits would
be Asia. These men would provide
interpreters and first-hand knowledge
about many Asiatic countries we don’t
know much about. Since the Citizen-
ship and Nationality Act 1967 has
come into force they would help stop
complaints from other Asian countries
about our immigration policies, because
they could settle here. If they went
back home without settling they could
help kill many of the myths in Asia
about Western nations. I think this
proposition should be studied closely.
One reason the Kiwis don’t want to
become an Australian State is that
they’re not Australians. Could some of
the New Zealand readers then answer
this rather simple but, nevertheless,
obvious question? Would there be a
better chance of a union if we changed
the name from Australia to Australasia?
Then, if there was a union, the New
Zealanders wouldn’t have to become
Australians. We’d be Aussies, they’d be
Kiwis, but we’d all be Australasians.
With the name Australasia, too, it would
be easier for some of the Pacific Islands,
e.g., Fiji, who wanted to to become
States.

Accounting merry-go-round
We read in The Bulletin, November
18, that: “So Ansett’s profits dropped
by $675,000, or 17 percent and
had it not been for a change in account-
ing methods it seems they could have
fallen by at least a further $250,000
and possibly a lot more . . .”
It is quite obvious that the plight of
shareholders and other parties inter-
ested in the financial reports of com-
panies is a very sorry one, indeed:
they are completely at the mercy of so-
called “generally accepted accounting
principles,” which are so diverse that
quite different results can be obtained
from the same data. And the auditor
can offer little help: the criterion for
“true and fair view” is, in part, “in
accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.”
When will it be,realised that financial
statements are not prepared for ac-
countants but for others with (more
than likely) little accounting know-
ledge? Even a qualified accountant
could not profess to know the results
or position of the company on the basis-
of historical figures given in the trad-
itional reports, unless he had prepared
them himself. The answer does not lie
in educating the public and informing
them that the accounts don’t mean
what they think they mean. It lies with
the profession asking itself “What is
accounting?” and “What properties
should it have to be useful?” The sug-
gestions are plentiful, if only the pro-
fessional bodies would examine them,
as they have done extensively in the
United States in recent years.

Defending nurses
This letter is addressed to that wide
circle of serious readers of The Bulle-
tin to whom April Horsey’s article
"What is the nurse’s future?” (8.,
Nov. 18) will be of recent recollection.
On behalf of the nursing staff of my
hospital I take exception to, and will
point out the weaknesses of comments
in the first, third, and sixth columns
of this article.
In the first column Miss Hersey has
made a generalisation based on the
views of one general practitioner. Had
it been based on a consensus of medi-
cal opinion it would be entitled to
serious consideration. This general
practitioner, who has, incidentally, less
contact with the nurse than has the
specialist in our large city hospitals,
believes the nurse to be . not much
more than a messenger girl.”
Against this particular view I will
give that of Professor Bruce Mayes,
Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology
at the University of Sydney. In his
work “A Textbook of Obstetrics” for
medical students, Professor Mayes
writes on page 302 of the 1965 new
and revised edition: “. . . I make bold
to suggest that sometimes doctors are
incompletely informed of the extent of
the obstetric nurse’s participation in
details vital to success. From my
training of nurses as well as medical
students I have been convinced of the
practical necessity of acquainting the
doctor with nursing details which too
often may be taken for granted . . .”
The facts are these: If a nurse com-
pletes three certificates she has attended
approximately 400 lectures and sat for
approximately 50 examinations. The
amount of study entailed and intelli-
gence required to cope with this train-
ing program should not be underesti-
mated. Add to this the fact that the
nurse is expected to work hard
physically during her training and the
extent of the nurse’s achievement on
graduation will become clear.
In the sixth column we see once
again a generalisation based on one
doctor’s opinion. It is this: Country
girls make tough nurses, with a tough
attitude to living things, because they
come, “in many cases,” from the rough
environment of a country property or
farm. It is the opinion of my col-
leagues that no difference exists be-
tween country nurses and city nurses.
Differences occur among individuals,
but the country-city dichotomy is not
a valid one.
In conclusion, it is probably true
that nursing does tend to “toughen”
girls. It would be better to say that
nursing matures girls quicker than
other professions. The trainee nurse
spends her post-adolescent years in an
atmosphere where human suffering and
death are part of her workday reality.
If she does not learn to control her
feelings, to hide the sadness and heart-
break she often experiences, she would
not be acting in the best interests of
her patients.

Regarding your article in The Bul-
letin dated 18th November “What is
the nurse’s future?” We as trained
nurses furthering our studies object to
the statement “lesbianism is as rife in
the hospitals as it is in the Army.”
We trained at two large hospitals in
Sydney, Royal North Shore and the
Children’s Hospital, and find this
statement to be untrue. What a slight
on the character of nurses generally!
We are amazed that a certain general
practitioner “with a large city prac-
tice” sends his patients to hospital
to be looked after by such incompetent
morons! How many of these patients
survive the traumatic experience of
hospitalisation with only imbeciles to
attend their needs!
Miss D. Annabel
Mrs. D. Webster
Turramurra, N.S.W.
The article printed in your edition
of November 18, 1967, “What is the
nurse’s future?” by April Hersey has
done great harm to the nursing pro-
fession at a most crucial time, and
especially to the younger generation.
The disparaging remarks, which are
also distasteful and inaccurate, will not
encourage girls to come into the profes-
sion.
We have been in it for many years,
and have yet to see “lesbianism rife in
nurses’ homes.” Also her unkind re-
marks about country girls are untrue.
Young nurses today work long hours
under adverse and difficult conditions
with little remuneration. The respon-
sibility of the sisters is indeed great —
a far cry from being “head messen-
gers.”
The parents of school leavers, having
read the article, will endeavor to direct
their daughters into other fields of
work.
So you have done us a disservice —-
and the community as well.

Taking (civil) liberties?
The students and others of the
Queensland University seem to.be en-
deavoring to give importance to some-
thing that the vast majority of Queens-
landers are not concerned with. We
had hoped that the folly was at an end
with recent legislation; but “the
expense of spirit in a waste of shame”
(8., Nov. 18) is obviously going to be
intensified and be caught up into the
other issues and causes. The Trades
and Labor Council, it would seem, is
climbing on to the bandwagon pro-
vided by the University’s Civil Liber-
ties Co-ordinating Committee. They
will do it no good.
Here are a few questions following
upon your article. Is the CLC commit-
tee duly constituted with proper min-
ute books and accredited representation,
or is it a loose sort of federation free
for all? I ask this because several
times, as by your writer again, Mr.
Laver has been called the CLC com-
mittee’s spokesman when, as I under-
stand it, he was not really on the com-
mittee or even appointed to that exclu-
sive role. Did he appoint himself, or
did the Press appoint him?

Knopfelmacher on Ho
The monotonous predictability of Dr.
Knopfelmacher’s opinions on “Ho Chi
Minh on Revolution” (8., Nov. 11)
made the article barely worth reading.
Whether valid or not, one would tend
to reject his pronouncements as one
would the views of any other pre-
judiced fanatic reviewing a subject to
which his hostility was renowned.
As a long-time and enthusiastic sub-
scriber to The Bulletin, I would prefer
you not to waste your pages and an
interesting topic to Knopfelmacher’s
Red-clouded worm’s-eye view.

Dialogues with Communists
Your 'article (8., Nov. 4) on a move-
ment by certain Catholic intellectuals
and Pax Christi groups in Melbourne
for a dialogue with the Communist
Party also mentioned that the com-
munist paper “Tribune” had published
in part an undelivered address by
Father Kenny stating: “There is an
increasing volume of evidence that the
West, and especially the U.S.A., have
been to some extent responsible for the
generation of the cold-war tensions.
The cold war was started by Soviet
Russia at the end of World War 11. It
broke the Yalta Agreement providing
for the setting up of democratic regimes
in Eastern Europe, imposing communist
ones by force on these countries. Then
about 1948-9 in breach of the Potsdam
Agreement it imposed an illegal block-
ade on the corridor from the West to
Berlin, which Britain and the U.S.
broke by a six-month air lift.
Many other examples could be given,
such as the brutal crushing by the
Soviet’s armed might of the freedom
uprising in Hungary in 1956, the erec-
tion of the shameful Berlin wall, and
the setting up of the missile base in
Cuba by the Soviet about 1962, which
the late President Kennedy forced to be
demolished —or else.
