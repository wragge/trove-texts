Coonardoo
First of The Bulletin's first Novel Com-
petition prize-winners to reach Australia in
book form is Coonardoo, by Katharine
Susannah Prichard (Cape; Dymocks). Its
appearance is welcome, if for no other
reason than the opportunity afforded of
quoting a few paragraphs from the author’s
preface:—
There has been some controversy as to whether
Coonardoo” is altogether a work of the roniautio
imagination. Life in the north-west of Western
Australia is almost as little known in Australia
as in England or America. It seems necessary to
say, therefore, that the story was written in the
country through which it moves.
Facts, characters, incidents, have been collected,
related and interwoven. That is all. The Coonardoo
1 knew and used to ride with, for instance, is not
the gin whose life-story has been told. And Hugh
is not my chivalrous host of those days, to whom,
and his charming wife, this book is dedicated! with
a sprig of wild rosemary.
Geary exists, although the Aborigines Department
has dealt with him lately. Recently, too, there lias
been a regulation to prevent white men from taking
rooms for a gin, or half-caste, in an hotel. Nowa-
days, also, aboriginal stockmen usually receive a
small wage as well as payment in kind by rations.
Before “Coonardoo” was printed in The Bulletin,
l asked Mr. Ernest Mitchell to read the MS. Mr.
Mitchell is chief inspector of aborigines for West
Australia. He has had 30 years’ experience of the
aborigines, and no one in this country has wider
knowledge and more sympathetic understanding of
the western, aiul nor’-west tribes. Mr. Mitchell' sug-
gested an omission and several changes of spelling',
but said that he could not fault the drawing of
aborigines and conditions in “Coonardoo” as he
knew them.
People who only see the blacks along the Trans-
continental line, or when they have become poor,
degraded and degenerate creatures, as a result of con-
tact with towns and the vices of white people,
cannot understand how different they are in their
natural state, or on isolated stations of the Nor’-West
where they are treated with consideration and
kindness.
Personally, that preface makes no differ-
ence at all to me. A story has only to
seem as true as this one, and I’m content.
Coonardoo—especially the girl, and then the
woman gone ultimately into the desert—is
more alive to me than that girl walking
now in George-strect. Geaiy’s physical
existence is quite unimportant. But, all the
same, the support of such an expert as Mr.
Mitchell is useful, because it answers the
bulk of the criticism that I have heard
levelled at the story, which, in. effect, said
the picture was untrue. Some other critics
—profane and otherwise—have shrunk from
the associations of whites and blacks in
the novel, apropos of which I am told that
J. F. Archibald, when he edited The Bul-
letin, laid down as an axiom for his con-
tributors, “Keep away from the black
velvet.” Apparently there was not much
of the Australian character that that keen
observer did not understand. In not
“keeping, away,” Coonardoo’s author has
tried to do the almost impossible—tried to
make a figure for romance out of an abori-
ginal. With any other native, from frag-
rant Zulu girl to fly-kissed Arab maid, she
could have done it. But the aboriginal, in
Australia, anyway, cannot excite any higher
feeling than nauseated pity or comical con-
tempt. In another way, too, the author
possibly offends. She is more frank, more
modem than other Australian writers permit
themselves to be. She recognises that it is
the business of the contemporary novel, if it
is to be also literature, to treat of life, and
she looks straight at life and uses as much
of it as her environment will permit her
to dare; which', compared with what creative
genius is daring as a normal thing abroad,
is, after all, not very much.
I have read the story in manuscript, in
Bulletin proofs, and now in book form.
At each reading its merits and the courage
of its author have stood out more boldly,
and so have the novel’s blemishes. A
blemish that, I noticed much more in read-
ing it from week to week than in manu-
script or book form was a certain barren-
ness in the middle. There is not enough
action—speaking of action in the dramatic
and not in the physical sense—to carry the
movement, without flagging, progressively
from the fine opening to the magnificent
end. I blame Mollie, rather; she never
seems to me to come really to life. And
the children do not exist as they should,
which is a serious defect in view of Phyllis’s
subsequent reappearance. Even if the others
were neglected, the early Phyllis needed to
be made more memorable,: the nine-year-old
Coonardoo of the first few pages is sufficient
proof that the author can portray a child
if she sets herself to the task. In that
middle part, too, the spotlight is not kept
strongly enough on Coonardoo. The story
might have been better for the presence of
a character with some humor—not neces-
sarily comicality—in his make-up. Judici-
ously used, such a character might have
emphasised by contrast the already well-
suggested harshness of the setting, and also
helped to bridge the mid-flatness. But to
make such suggestions is to stray outside
the material domain of criticism into the
nebulous and forbidden land of speculation.
The author’s attempt-to keep the novel
torm alive and vital in Australia alone
outweighs the minor blemishes I have men-
tioned. Apart from that, “Coonardoo,”
with the white flame of the author’s crea-
tive power burning through it, is itself vital
—a harsh but a living piece of literature.
CECR MANN.
Writing the Vernacular
As yet. we have in Australia no hard and
fast rule for the. handling of the vernacular
in fiction. Our writers are merely feeling
their way, each tackling the question in
his own fashion. The results are interesting.
In fiction it is often necessary to set out
the speech of the uncultured, the ungram-
matical, the fellow who drops his “h’s” and
his “g’s” and murders vowel sounds. How
should such speech be printed in good
fiction? Plain dialect is easy enough, for
it is definite, but the vernacular is not dia-
lect. If the navvy or the bulloekv has to
say, in his own way, “I am not going to
believe what you say.” the author may print
it just like that; or like this, “I ain’t gurina
b’lieve whatcher say”; or he may be con-
tent, with a mere indication, “I ain’t going
to believe what you say.”
The second and literal interpretation is the
most exact one. but it does not follow that
it is the best. It is overdone and it offends
the eye. And it is quite unnecessary. The
third version. I would maintain, expresses
all that needs to be expressed. I do not
agree with writers who bar entirely all inter-
ference with spelling to attain the ver-
nacular, relying only upon phrasing arid
rhythm to express the speech of the un-
educated. That is sometimes enough, but
not always. It tends to make the news-
boy talk like the professor, and both like
the author himself. Whatever is still
debatable, it*is certain that all the ins and
outs of a man’s lingo need not and must
pot, be followed to get. strict accuracy.
Edward Dyson does this, and the result is
horrible. Here is a bit from “F'aet’ry
’Ancls” —
Ther graft wasn’t what yeh’d call ’ard, V it
suited me complaint t’ lie there ’n’ lurk, waiting
fer ther little lydies ’n’ ther stout gents ter .’it
ther pipe.
Dyson’s matter, his invention and his
humor are first class, and he does perhaps
get, the Australian drawl, but that sort of
vernacular throughout would damn any
book.
The truth is that a writer can get the
effect he wants by phraseology and choice
of words, with only an occasional resort,
to home-made phonetic spelling. That he
can get it without bad spelling at all is
a question worthy of debate. I believe that
he cannot. A correctly-printed phrase like
“Me and Billo had a pint” expresses your
proletaire. at once; there is no need to print
it: “Me an’ Billo ’ad er pint.” I think it
would be bad art to do so.
I should say that the dropping of the hard
initial “h” and of the “g” at the end of
present participles is .justified. So are “me”
for “my,” “ain’t” for “are not,” and a very
few more. But, one sees much ;otherwise
excellent, prose ruined by the overdoing of
the vernacular, till dialogue reads like a
Penny Comic. “Ther” for “the,” “ter” for
“to,” “orl” for “all,” arid such horrors are
never justified and never effective because
they are never so spoken, if the letter “r”
lias any value at all. Your rough diamond
might- say “Oh lor!” but no.one ever said'
“Gord” or “arsk” or “tork.”
Our writers of fiction are still uncertain
about the slurred “you.” We see it written
as “y’,” “yer,” “yeh,” and so on, and perhaps
the first is the least of these evils. They
seem unnecessary because we all slur small
words. We all occasionally saj r “o’” for
of. “t”’ for to. “th”’ for the. “an”’ or “’n”
for and.. Why then torture and uglify the
text with such letterpress contortions?
JAMES DEVANEY.
An Australian Anthem
One of the best, attempts at an Australian
anthem is Brunton Stephens’s “Maker of
Earth and Sea,” though, strangely enough,
it appears in only one anthology o? Aus-
tralian verse. It is particularly full of
fervor:—
Maker of earth and sea,
What shall we render Thee?
All thing’s are Thine.
Ours but from day to day,
Still with one heart we pray—
Ood bless our land alwav,
This land of Thine.
Here let Thy peace abide;
Never may strife divide
This land of Thine.
Let us united stand,
One great Australian band.
Heart to heart, hand in hand,
Heart and hand Thine.”
I heave pleasant memories of singing that
anthem with hundreds of other scholars on
(Red Page continued on page 5.)

NASH LEADS THE WORLD IN MOTOR CAR VALUE
Equipped
with
Everything
Without Price Penalty
The newest Nash “400” with the Twin-Ignition
motor has some of the greatest owner advan-
tages ever put in a motor-car. It is equipped
with everything from bumpers to tyre lock—all
without extra cost.
It is a fact that this new “400” presents a degree
of mechanical perfection unknown even to the
highest-priced cars of a few years ago.
Then, there were no features such as High
Compression, Twin-Ignition, Centralised Chassis
Lubrication, nor Hydraulic Shock Absorbers.
Money couldn’t have bought a car with such
unbelievable ease of steering and such positive
four-wheel brakes.
Yet this luxury car is now available without
luxury’s usual price penalty.

the Melbourne Exhibition oval. It has been

There have been several ambitious
attempts since, notably one by A. G.
Stephens. His “Australia—Land of All the
Earth the Best” was set to music under
remarkable circumstances many years ago.
Mr. Stephens was to lecture on Australian
Women Poets one evening. At 11 o’clock
the same morning he sought the aid of a
Marshall Hall Conservatorium student, Miss
V. Bedford, who set the words to music
by noon. That night she sang the completed
anthem, two verses of which are: —
Land of all the earth the best,
Land I love beyond the rest,
Daughter Land of kingly line,
Dear Mother Land of mine.
Lady bright in soft array,
Blue and gold and green and grey—
Australia!
Australia!
We sing our love to thee!
Waves that deep around us roll
Shout their freedom to the soul.
Skies that sweep above us fair
Tell the glorious hope we share.
Ours the days of dear delights,
Ours the million shining lights—
Australia!
Australia!
We sing our trust in thee.
Another excellent effort, “The Austral-
asian Flag,” by neighbor-friend John Libby,
goes with a swing. I quote the last verse
and refrain:—
All hail the Standard of the South; Shield of the
realm of State,
The Glory Flag of Commonwealth, bright oracle
of fate;
Emblazoned with the Pointer star and Southern
Cross divine—
The Jack completes the Austral flag that waves o’er
Freedom’s shrine.
Refrain.
Hurrah for Australasia! Unitedly we stand,
A southern constellation the beacon of our land.
Hurrah for Austral colors, those glorious and bright:
The primal hues from stellar rays, the beams of
cosmic light.
In common with the work of W. R.
Furlong, Alfred Hill and Fritz Hart, the
efforts I have mentioned should be more
generally known and sung in Australia.
Again, years ago, a prize of £lOO was won
by Arthur 11. Adams for a “best national
song,” yet the song is lost sight of to-day
in a welter of mediocre music. Two verses
of it are:—
Vast the heritage we hold,
League on endless leagues unrolled,
Splashed with sun and wattle gold—
God’s demesne, Australia.
Freedom for our onward stride,
Wide our continent, and wide
Are the faiths and hopes that guide
God's demesne, Australia.
Time and again it has been said that we,
as a nation, must sing our own songs. Is
not the time ripe to make a choice?
ANDREW G. MILLETT.
Archaeology and the Flood
“J.E in his would-be satirical comments
on the suggestion that the Biblical story of
the Flood has been corroborated (R.P.
l/5/'29), obviously possesses that little
knowledge which is a dangerous thing. Ur
has been excavated by a man of standing,
C. Leonard Woolley, and, in the earlier
stages, there was associated with him the
bearer of one of the best- and most favor-
ably-known names connected with Near
East scholarship, H. R. Hall.
The charitable assumption is that “J.E.”
has read an abridged or garbled account of
the report which appeared in the Times
of March 16. From this report we learn
that, the Royal Tombs at Ur were built
at the bottom of deep shafts, sunk through
a thick deposit of stratified earth, rich in
pottery. Obviously this thick deposit is
older than the tombs, and appears to have
been a refuse-dump containing the rubbish
of the Ur of those times. The strata im-
mediately outside the town dip at a steep
angle (45deg.); those further away flatten
out to the horizontal. Natural agents (dust-
depositing wind and rain) have helped to
form these outer strata, which contain a
fair amount of pottery and, significantly
enough, “in each stratum the fragments lay,
not at all angles, as they do higher up,
but flat, at the bottom of a deposit of
smooth, water-laid mud.” The excavators
dug through this deposit to the level of
the outer plain, and found
virgin soil, a clean water-laid clay, without the
-lightest admixture of pottery or ash or other human
debris That there might be no possible mistake,
we carried our pits deeper, through eight solid feet
of clean clay, and then suddenly came upon a flat
stratum rich in flint chips and cores, pottery like
that found above, and painted fragments of that A 1
’Ubaid ware which I had last summer labelled as
antediluvian.
A new type of burnt brick was found at
the bottom, showing that
at the time when the painted pottery and the
flints were in use, Ur was not merely a village of
mud huts, but already a town civilised and properly
built. Then, at a few feet above sea-level, real
virgin soil, the clean river silt of the island on which
the first huts were built.
Obviously the Painted Pottery People, the
earliest settlers of all, were overwhelmed
by one big flood, or an uninterrupted series
of small floods, which deposited the eight
feet of clean clay. If “J.E.” has another
explanation of the facts, archaeologists would
like to investigate it. Two days later Dr.
Langdon, excavating at Kish, some 140
miles from Ur, announced (Daily Tele-
graph, March 18) that he, too, had found
traces of the flood.
The legend of the flood is an old one;
it was known in Sumeria at least as early
as 2000 b.c.; and there is no doubt that
the Flood of Genesis is also the flood of
those far older Sumerian records (see the
Brit. Museum Handbook, “The Babylonian
Story of the Deluge and the Epic of Gil-
gamish, with an account of the Royal
Libraries of Nineveh,” 1920. Price Is. 6d.).
“J.E.,” after overlooking the significant
painted pottery finds under the eight-foot
bed of clay, is prepared to relegate the
whole discovery into the limbo of forgotten
things merely because the picturesque
details of the Genesis version (“fountains
of the deep breaking up,” etc.) were not, at
the very first moment of the discovery,
either explained or substantiated; nay, he
even goes farther and suggests that as the
Ur finds apparently do not throw any light
on the theory (and it is merely a theory),
“that the whole meteoric system was caused
by the bursting of a large planet which once
revolved between Saturn and Jupiter,” they
ought to be disregarded! The purpose of
archaeology is to record facts, not to bother
with wild theories. Nor is Mr. Woolley’s
suggestion the less probable merely be-
cause “J.E.” has been in places where it
rained 40 days and 40 nights without a
flood resulting. It has taken less than that
space of time to cause some quite disastrous
floods in N. S. Wales during ray own
lifetime. A further point is that in historical
times the rainfall of Asia has become con-
siderably less; it can be scientifically shown
that Mesopotamia enjoyed quite good rain-
fall in prehistoric days, and Mesopotamia
is the area which suffered the flood; only
the imaginings of “J.E.” suggest that the
whole world was flooded at one and the
same time.
A very eminent archmologist, O. G. N.
Crawford, one of the first to denounce the
Glozel forgeries and therefore not easily
hoodwinked, thinks “Mr. Woolley has a
very strong case.” All responsible scholars
will agree, and all those seriously interested
will await further information instead of
exercising their wit at the expense of
men who have devoted a lifetime
to this kind of work and who make
statements only after a slow and exhaustive
consideration of all the available evidence.

A Satchel of Books
Nature and Literature, by Edmund B 1 un-
don (Hogarth Press). No. 9 of the Hogarth
lectures on literature. A fruitful mixing
of odd and other information with light,
undogmatic criticism.
The Fif/ht for the Ashes, 1928-29, by M. A.
Noble (Harrap, London). A carefully com-
piled account of the tour of the last English
Eleven in Australia, with comments which
gain weight from the author’s reputation,
though it is a pity that he should have gone
out of his way to attack the Board of Con-
trol in his introductory chapter. The illus-
trations are excellent.
The Wisdom of Cl. K. Chesterton, by Pat-
rick Braybrookc (Cecil Palmer). As thor-
oughgoing an appreciation as anyone might
wish to have. Chesterton is considered under
nine heads —critic, novelist, essayist, histo-
rian, playwright, poet, Christian, traveller
and man. Every facet is a thing of price,
only in most insignificant details does Mi'.
Braybrooke disagree with his hero. In spite
of the flavor of special pleading, however,
the wide range of Chesterton’s work and
activities is carefully surveyed.
The Riven Pall, by Ronald Gower (Dent).
The author has drawn some line pictures
in such books as “C 3” of the boys who
struggle through London’s poorer schools.
In this novel he deals with life at a muni-
cipal secondary school. Harry Storth be-
longs to an ancient Yorkshire family, some
of whose members, such as Sir Alfred Storth,
Bart., are rich, while others are confectioners
and publicans. He is the son of a "little
boss” and the grandson of a working man ;
and the story shows how his environment
contributes to his eventual success. It would
be a noticeable book if only for the picture
it gives of a strange and fascinating world
which is ignored by most English writers
of to-day.
Murder Most Foul, by George A. Birming-
ham (Chatto and Windus; Roycroft, Syd-
ney). The author tells in his own cheery
style the stories of 23 of Britain’s most gory
and interesting crimes, including the little
affairs of Captain Goodere, Professor Web-
ster, Dr. Palmer, Dr. Lanson, the ingenuous
poisoner Katharine Ogilvy, and other beauties.
In his introduction he argues a strong case
for the crime story. Like the villain in a duel
scene, the murderer on trial is fighting for
liis life. Like the hero in the duel, English
society Uglits fair against him; and the
thrill comes from the very fact that nowhere
else does the villain get such absolutely fair
play, plus the fact that a life is at stake.
In other words, the trial of a murderer is
a supreme sort of sporting event. Not the
least merit of this book is the admirable
painting of the leading characters, all far
enough away from direct contact to permit
the reader to take a quite impersonal view
of even the death agonies of their victims.
Cowbimj the Caribbees, by Harry L. Fos-
ter (Bodley Head; Dymocks). As the
writers of hundreds of travel books have
amply proved, it is not very difficult to
describe a given place so that a reader
who did not know it will have a reasonably
accurate idea of what it is like, how its
people dress and talk and eat, whether
there is an early-closing Act, and, if so, an
infallible method of getting a drink after
hours. It takes the rare bird like Foster
to give the little bit extra which spells the
sense of actually travelling with the obser-
ver. He started the trip which his book's
title fairly describes intent upon supplying
his publisher with an orthodox guide-book
on the West Indies. But the first place he
called at so attracted him that he dropped
off his boat with the idea of catching the
next a fortnight or so later, to find, too late,
that there was no next. So he goes on
unconventionally combing the Caribbees,
examining those entrancing islands with an
eye that takes in pretty well everything,
from tin’ refuse in a town gutter to the fine
figure of a maid on a mountain road.

Thin Yorky: The Federal Constitution Bill as
originally drafted was referred to the electors of
N.S.W., Vic., S.A. and Tas. in 1898; 219,712 voted
for it and 108,303 against, but the N.S.W. majority
(5367) was insufficient. Resubmitted in ’99, with
seven amendments made at the instance of N.S.W.
and Queensland joining in, it was accepted, the
voting being 107,420 to 82,741 in N.S.W., 152,653
to 9805 in Vic., 65,990 to 17,053 in S.A., 13,437
to 791 in Tas. and 38,488 to 30,996 in Q’land. The
Commonwealth Bill was passed in the Imperial
Parliament without amendment and received the
Royal assent in July, 1900 ; Westralia voted 44,801
for and 19,691 against three weeks later and came
in as an original State Spouts: Nothing odd about
it. Why, Durban is the headquarters of a whaling
industry—a pretty big one, too. In 1926 two Natal
cos. operating with 16 boats killed 1094 whales which
yielded 7510 tons of oil; total production was valued
at £204,150.

GOVERNMENT BY AMATEURS.
Amateurism is the bane of the Govern-
ment at Canberra. Long as they have been
m office, Bruce and Page are amateur
statesmen and will never be anything else.
They went into public life, not because
they had any particular bent for it, but
because they reckoned it a decent thing
(being decent fellows) for men in their
position to do. They attained power by
the accident of circumstances before either
of them had served much of an apprentice-
ship, and they have drifted on to a financial
crisis of their own making without convic-
tions or a plan, their one settled belief (use-
less to them now) being that the way to
solve problems of government is to refer
them to conferences and Royal Commis-
sions. Their colleagues, for the. most part,
are even more amateurish than themselves.
The one conspicuous exception is Pearce,
who has been by turns Freetrader, Protec-
tionist and Revenue Tariffist, Socialist and
anti-Socialist, Pacifist and War Minister,
Hater of Titles and Knight, Laborite,
Nationalist and Country-party. This gentle-
man is Bruce-Page’s principal adviser.
The Government can be fearfully inert
in matters like the construction of the
North-South railway, but, as a rule, its
inertia is less mischievous than its activity.
When it fancies action is required it acts
on impulse. It does things by fits and
starts, regardless of its own precepts and
past proceedings. Thus the course of a
few revolving moons will find it keen on
keeping the Commonwealth line of steam-
ers and keen on selling them; anxious to
extend the authority of the Federal Arbi-
tration Judges and anxious to destroy it;
all for strengthening the Army, Navy and
Air Force and all for weakening them. The
Treasurer lays down the proposition that
it is unsound for one authority to raise
money by taxation and for another to spend
it. Then he rushes into an agreement bind-
ing his Government to give the States
£20,000,000 for road-construction and -main-
tenance—an agreement so loose that the
State receiving the lion’s share of the easy
money is not even bothering to publish
costs, though in an incautious moment it
admitted that one of the roads had got
away with £28,000 per mile. The Prime
Minister gives employers patronising advice
on how to run their businesses and treat their
hands, even while his own concern closes the
financial year with a deficit of £2,338,000
(it anticipated a surplus of £13,000) and
is sacking men from the Defence Depart-
ment—men who had every right to con-
sider themselves permanent employees—by
the hundred, if not the thousand. The
same gentleman is fond of saying that “the
cost of production must come down.” Appa-
rently. with the notion of helping to bring
it down his Government proposes to in-
crease the excise duties on beer, spirits and
tobacco, duties which already yield over
£11,500,000 p.a.
Beer and tobacco are surely dear enough
already. If they are made dearer by Bruce-
Page action the unions, will undoubtedly
apply to the wage-fixing tribunals for cor-
responding increases—that is, if the Com-
monwealth Statistician doesn’t allow for
them in his quarterly estimates of
the cost of living with which the basic
wage rises or falls. If the Government
can’t get along without more revenue,
why doesn’t it tax the tourists who go
abroad in their thousands during nine
months of the year and spend tons of
Australian money in foreign hotels, rag-
shops, theatres and so forth? Many of
these trippers are ladies of leisure, and they
are far better able to pay taxation than
Australians who work hard for their beer
and tobacco and spend all they have in
their o\ :t country. And why isn’t the Com-
monwealth tax on entertainments where the
charge is less than 2s. 6d. reimposed? That
tax was removed as a concession to the
moving-picture interest, with a loss of
revenue amounting to £220,000 in the first
year. The Government is much too subser-
vient to the moving-picture interest. And,
everywhere, bluffers find it an easy mark.
CUTTING DOWN THE LOAN
ESTIMATES.
In the year to June 30 Australian exports
exceeded imports by £1,152,142. This is
a thing which has happened in only two
years out of the last seven. Taking the
seven years as a whole, exports have failed
to pay for imports by £57,000,000 and some
odd coppers, and, of course, they failed to
pay anything at all towards interest and
sinking fund on external debts. The balance
of imports and the interest bill have been
met in the only way possible—by floating
new loans abroad. No other English-speak-
ing community tells such an astonishing
tale, the result solely of not producing
enough and of luxuriously consuming too
much. Australia itself didn’t show a trace
of the disease till after June, 1920. June,
1920, was about the date when the Bolshevik
regime and the activities of malignant con-
spirators with Red flags commenced. It
isn’t an ordinary and comparatively harm-
less complaint such as mumps, but more
like deliberately acquired and cultivated
leprosy.
Through the growth of foreign liabilities
a surplus of £5,000,000 (exports over im-
ports) is less satisfactory now than a defi-
ciency of £5,000,000 (exports below imports)
was just prior to 1920. Somewhere about
£220,000,000 has been added to Australia’s
outside debt since 1921, and, though nomi-
nally for public works here, it was really
spent abroad to pay the price of too little
hard earning and too much luxurious spend-
ing. The middlemen who take up our
loans and retail them naturally made no
undue haste to spread a wet blanket on this
business; but they are no longer enthusi-
astic. New York financiers were the first
to show failing confidence. Now the Loan
Council is much concerned about London
also, with the result that Australian Trea-
surers have been told they must cut down
their Loan estimates another 20 per cent.
A side issue is that statisticians have
agreed to admit that the export figures are
not even as good as they seem. Of the
money nominally received for foreign-sold
butter in 1928-29, -they find that £1,755,000
wasn’t received from foreign buyers at all.
It was contributed out of the aid levied on
Australian butter makers, which levy began
at 3d. per lb. and has crept up to
A slightly different situation, but one which
produces a similar result, prevails in the
matter of exported sugar. The sum total-
is that in 1924-25 £1,043,000 and in 1928-29
££‘,347,000 of the butter and sugar export
money wasn’t available to meet liabilities
abroad, but was our own paper currency
subscribed here, and was rather an internal
loss than an external profit. The amount
of this comforting illusion during the course
of five years is set down at £13,688,000.
Things are not what they seem—too many
of them.
The Federal Government has doubtless
every possible desire that Australia should
pay what it owes; but a pious desire is
wholly insufficient. Practical measures which
suggest themselves are a rigorous cutting
down of imports and much less tender
sympathy with professional destroyers of
industry. If Bruce and Page have any
other inspirations, it is time to produce them
and get to work. It would be a cruel trick
of Fate if two such high-minded men were
ever accused of being purposeful nation-
wreckers; but very high-minded men, whose
only fault was incapacity, have been accysed
of all sorts of things. Among those who
smashed big banks wholesale some 28 years
ago there was probably not one who
wouldn’t have shuddered at the idea of
smashing even a child’s money-box.
A SURVEY OF PROHIBITION.
The writer of this article is an Aus-
tralian professional man, trained to
weigh evidence, who lately spent several
months in the U.S.A. making a survey
of this and other problems.
. Very few people know enough about Pro-
hibition. in the U.S.A. to justify the very
definite statements they make about it. One
man recently returned from the States said
that he had yet to meet the American who
believed in Prohibition. Many less down-
right travellers say it is a total failure, or
ridicule it. My estimate may not be any
better than theirs, but I believe that the
majority of Americans are in favor of
Prohibition, if they could get it. A great
body of them certainly prefer even the
existing mess to the sort of mess that pre-
ceded it, and hope for effective Prohibition
later on. Few of them, however, could
suggest a means of obtaining it.
It is just as certain that a great many
prefer freedom of action in this as in
other respects, and among these are the
practical rebels who are willing to pay a big
price for poor liquor. Some of it is not
so poor either. There is real Scotch
whisky to be got, though most of it is young
and somewhat lively. In addition to this,
there are many weird concoctions to bo
obtained carrying well-known labels but
tasting like nothing on earth, and having,
in some cases, quite exciting effects. The
best whisky is worth from 75 to 90 dollars
a case, and as there is, for obvious reasons,
no duty to be paid, there is a large margin
to provide for c.i.f., together with certain
special payments necessitated by the char-
acter of the business, and still leave a sub-
stantial profit. The business is so extensive
and the profit so handsome that not only do
the bootleggers prosper, but their staffs of
bandits have a great deal more money than
is good for them. Many successful boot-
leggers might, under other circumstances,
be more or less reputable business men,
but their employees are not drawn from a
high social strata.
The amount of money that finds its way
into the hands of this element is one
of the worst features of the whole business.
The criminal in the United States has never
hitherto been so financial. Even before the
18th Amendment was enacted, it was charac-
teristic of Americans that they were fonder
of making laws than of conforming to them
when made, and one of the effects of Pro-
hibition has been to accentuate this failing.
Then, again, young bloods and their lady
friends have got into the habit of brighten-
ing things up with a drink or two when
they meet together. They resent being told
they must not, and in many circles it has
become the thing to do. Too plainly some
are getting to like it.
On the credit side there is one big entry.
Generally, the working man and his wife
and family are very much better off than
they were when the sale of liquor was legal.
This is one result of Prohibition, in support
of which any amount of evidence can be
found. Statistics support it, and so do
dozens of large employers of labor and
scores of workmen whom I have met.
Some of them were teetotallers on prin-
ciple, others only by force of circumstances;
but even those who regretted the difficulty
and cost and sometimes the risk of having
a few drinks admitted that they and their
friends were much better off than they used
to be, financially and otherwise.
In some States Prohibition is substan-
tially effective. On the other hand, in most
if not all of the big cities there seems
little chance of its ever becoming effective.
Very few Americans are satisfied with the
existing conditions, and I would say that
this discontent is growing. The dry ones
want more stringent enforcement; the wet
ones and those that are merely damp are
continually getting more restless and resent
the not infrequent killing of citizens just
because they were having a drink, or some-
one thought they were.
There do not seem to be many who
doubt that their country has got itself
into a mess. The repeal of the 18th Amend-
ment requires such overwhelming legis-
lative majorities in so many States that
it does not seem possible to do anything
that way. Can it be generally enforced?
I should think the answer is in the nega-
tive. It has been suggested that some day
the Supreme Court of the United States
might decide to call the 18th Amendment
unconstitutional. If it did there might
easily be another civil war. Legalisation
of light wines and beer does not make a
big hit either.
My guess is that, like some other amend-
ments of the Constitution, it will be allowed
to lapse where it does not fit, and will live
where the environment is favorable. It
has done a lot of good, and it has done »
lot of harm, but I do not believe there is
anyone capable of forming a close estimate
of the net result. The Americans have to
work out their own salvation and will prob-
ably do so in time, but the lesson that others
may learn is that, despite the good that
can be credited to Prohibition—and it is
considerable—the price paid is too high to
encourage others to follow their example.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Soldiers “Can Do Without Training.”
General Chauvel, faced with the Bruce-
Page resolve to cut down Australia’s
skeleton army a bit further, made the best
of a pitiable job after this fashion (daily
paper report):—
“He believed that the men in the country
could do without training, because boys in
the out-back parts had some individuality,
and swung into training when it was needed
more easily than city boys.”
The example of the United States is a
dreary commentary. When the mad Hun
began the indiscriminate sinking of Uncle’s
ships, trouble was inevitable. The republic
had money to burn and possible ammunition
factories enough and to spare, so it didn’t
start from scratch. War had been looming
for two years, ever since the sinking ol
the Lusitania. Yet no preparations had
been made. When the U.S. declared war,
64 days after unrestricted murder had com-
menced, and followed this up 23 days later
by authorising an army of 500,000 men, it
depended largely on the idea that it had a
rather special kind of 'people who could
almost “do without training.” But it re-
quired the best part of a year and much
outside advice and assistance before a
serviceable-army was produced.
If Hun and Co. had won a decisive
victory during the early part of. that year,
which they almost did, and had captured
Allied warships just as the Allies ultimately
captured theirs, it might have been an end
to the House that Washington built. The
republic would have stood alone against
a vastly superior army and navy, with a
half-baked military force of its own, and
within its gates nearly 5,000,000 of people
born in Germany, Hungary, Turkey and
Austria, to say nothing of the mighty, host
of their children, born in the U.S., but of
doubtful reliability. It was one of the
giddiest risks in history, and is a matter
which Uncle doesn’t like to discuss over-
much.
There are, or have been, races which
could put up a scrap after their own fashion
(and it was sometimes ■ a fashion which
knocked saucepans out of good European
troops) without any special training. The
Scottish Highlanders, the Afghans and the
Montenegrins supply instances. But in
these countries every man was a soldier,
not so much by compulsion as because he
couldn’t think of anything else to be, and
sometimes he wouldn’t go ploughing unless
fully armed, and the baby was born on a
war footing. The Boers represented the
same type, but improved, educated and
brought up to date. No civilised nation
with anything to lose can afford to rest on
the conviction that its population has a
natural aptitude for the gory, tented field,
and will successfully rush to arms, includ-
ing the carving-knife, on an emergency.
An untrained nation is always an unarmed
or ill-armed nation, and even the carving-
knife may be blunt.
«
Law, Battles and Mr. Theodore.
Possibly there are too many lawyers in
Parliament, but an acquaintance with the
law and with legal principles is a very useful
part of the equipment of a legislator. If
E. G. Theodore knew anything about the
laws he has for several years been assisting
to make, he would have been saved from
asking two very silly yet dangerous ques-
tions and making an equally silly yet
dangerous assertion at a meeting in Sydney
Town Hall. It was a meeting convened for
the purpose of protesting against the prose-
cution of seven men who are alleged to
be “controlling” an illegal strike—a strike
that has produced several acts of violence
and more than one conflict with massed
bodies of police; and presumably, as on
previous occasions, unionists were compelled
to attend under threats of victimisation.
Here are a few extracts from Mr. Theo-
dore’s oration as reported by the Labor
Daily :
“What have the timber-workers done that
they should be treated as criminals and bad-
gered and hounded by the police? They are
fighting a perfectly lawful battle for th;
maintenance of hardly-won industrial con-
ditions .... Is there any law compelling
workers to work under conditions that they
consider unjust? If there ivas, a man would
not be a free agent. He would be a slave."
The timber-workers have come in conflict
with the police, as even ‘ Mr. Theodore
should be aware, not because they will not
work themselves, but because they have
shown a disposition to assemble in small or
large numbers for the quite illegal purpose
of abusing and assaulting men who, desiring
to work, have dared to seek employment
under a Federal award. But apart from
that, so far have they been from “fighting
a perfectly lawful battle” that their whole
“battle” is unlawful. Every Arbitration Act.
State or Federal, contains provisions which
seek to compel parties to an award to obey
it, and there is no dispensation in any o!
those Acts allowing either party to disobey

an award, either by a strike or a lock-out,
because it considers the provisions of the
award unjust.
The timber-workers and their advisers —
who are not timber-workers—have been
looking for trouble, and they have found
it. Were it not for the constitutional
inability of the Federal Government, under
the Bruce-Page regime, to enforce the
authority of its industrial courts, they would
have found a lot more. Apparently what
Mr. Theodore, who talks about “fighting a
battle,” is pleading for is the immunity from
the law of any person who might be ex-
pected to give Mr. Theodore’s party a
vote.

Beggars at the Gate.
Deputations of unreasoning mendicants and
habitual leaners upon the State are more
common in Australia than in any other
country, and the Acting-Premier of N. S.
Wales has been having his full share and
more. A notable episode was the visit of
a crowd which asked for £4,000,000 of loan
funds to relieve distress in Alexandria and
four adjacent suburbs where strike move-
ments go strong whenever there is the least
excuse, and basher gangs are too well
known. The suggested loan was raised from
£4,000,000 to £10,000,000 before the inter-
view terminated. That was Poverty plead-
ing for a dole.
A little later Comparative Riches looked
in on a similar errand. The N.S.W.
Farmers and Settlers decided that it wanted
the Government to spend £5,000,000, to
begin with, on “resuming large privately-
owned estates, and settling on them farmers
and their sons.” There was the usual com-
plaint that “while thousands of experienced
men could not get land, millions of acres
within easy distance of railways were
locked up.” It wasn’t said that they are
unused, or even insufficiently used, but
merely that they don’t carry so many
humans as they might do. Justice Pike,
who has been inquiring into land problems,
reports that Australia’s losses on Soldier
Loan Settlement alone have been over 23i
million pounds, N.S.W.’s share being seven
millions. This is depressing.
It would improve the situation if an
assurance was given that the “farmers and
their sons” would undertake to pay for the
land right off, and thus leave the demoralis-
ing and ruinous loan out of the calculation.
If they have neither the money nor the
credit, that is a misfortune. The Govern-
ment has no spare money either, and it
has learned that its credit isn’t sufficient
to keep works already in progress going at
a reasonable pace. The supreme difficulty
is that so much loan money is raised abroad,
interest payable in gold or in exports of
produce which will sell for gold, and the
country gets further away from supplying
the necessary surplus of produce as time
goes on. That means a steady shuffle to-
wards national insolvency. There is no
promise of improvement in the fact that,
despite all past, present and prospective
loans, the number of males employed on
the Ma State’s land has decreased since
1920 by over 7000. Possibly some of the
people who get 1000-acre farms on sub-
other day, whereas the quest has been
prosecuted abroad with all the fervor of
a crusade.

Sham Legislatures.
The representation accorded the non-
official white population of Papua in the
local Legislative Council finds little favor
with those most concerned, particularly
as regards the method of making appoint-
ments. They are made by the Governor-
General on the recommendation of the
Papuan Government, and nothing need be
known of them until they appear in the
Government Gazette; with the result that
the people “represented” not only do not
know who a new appointee is to be, but
are given no chance of protesting if they
consider him unfitted for the job.
The white population of Papua, outside
officials and perhaps the missions, is
thoroughly dissatisfied with the scheme,
and is regarding with wondering amusement
the eager desire of its New Guinea equiva-
lent to be endowed with the same blessings.

Psychoanalysis and Pfraud.
The B.M.A. in London, after an interesting
debate, has passed a resolution affirming
that psychoanalysis is “not a danger to
youth.” Of course, it was referring to
reputable practitioners. Unfortunately, the
application of the discoveries of Jung and
Freud is not confined to properly-qualified
men. The somewhat odoriferous purlieus
of the unconscious is a particularly happy
hunting-ground for hordes of quacks, and
that they can and do cause a great deal
of harm there can be no doubt.
In Australia “professors” of the cult
abound. They are unhampered with medi-
cal knowledge, but their esoteric knowledge
of the inner meaning of dreams is vast.
They sit in darkened rooms holding the
hands of their patients while they invite
them to pour out the sick imaginings which
they call the revelations of the unconscious
mind. Constipation may be the prosaic
cause of the trouble, but an “cedipus com-
plex” sounds ever so much more real be-
cause the sufferer doesn’t know what it
means. Pretty well every object in Heaven
and earth has been listed by Freudians as
being a symbol of sexual desire; with many
people the suggestions of the “psycho-
analyst” can turn a harmless habit into an
obsession damaging in the extreme.

The Muddle at Canberra.
Hatred of Commissions has not lessened in
Canberra since the news was passed round
that the Bruce-Pages had decided to con-
tinue the Federal Capital triumvirate for
another year at least. Everybody in Can-
berra is anti-Commission; it is about the
only thing in the place on which people
are at one.
It has not been all the fault of the body
which rules the Capital by Ordinance, and
has become so .autocratic that it all but
rings the curfew every night. The body
was set up as a construction authority with
a five years’ term, and anticipated that it
ivould be 1929 at least before Parliament
would want to step into the place. Sudden
change of plan hastened (and muddled) a
divided estates don't stay there, and are
none too particular about keeping the pro-
perty subdivided.
The condensed moral of the whole busi-
ness is that the settlement debt remains in
full even if the settlers don’t. And that
part of the debt which is owing abroad
(nearly two-thirds of the N. S. Wales debt
is owing abroad) increases by the full
amount of the interest because of the in-
variable failure to produce enough surplus
products to meet even a part of the bill.
Therefore every deputation should be asked
in advance if its intention is to say any-
thing about a loan, and that if so the
visit isn’t worth while .W

The Country Trader and the Vic.
Railways.
“P.M.” puts the country traders’ case:—
It is far from correct to say that the
Hallam Valley gardeners (Vic.) have 6rgan-
ised the country market without State assist-
ance (B. 24/7/’29). They have the assist-
ance of the Railway Department to gain an
unfair advantage over the country trader.
Their bags of vegetables have to be ordered
from the stationmaster three days before-
hand. The order is wired on to Hallam by
the railways, so the growers don’t have to
pick the stuff until the order is received;
and cash must be paid in advance. Then
the stationmaster has to deliver the goods
and collect and remit the cash, practically
free of charge. Is it fair to expect the coun-
try trader to compete against that? Many
of the country stores have sold large quan-
tities of vegetables on credit to farmers who
had not the cash to pay for them. Now
the railways are using public servants to
undersell them for cash! I know a man
who has over £lOOO out in fruit and vege-
tables, and now sees the railways, to whom
he has paid a considerable sum in spot
cash for freight on the goods he has not yet
been paid for, selling against him.
Again, the freight rates are loaded against
the country trader. The Hallam Valley
crowd is allowed to consign in bulk to
our local station, and pays 30s. per
ton for 170 miles. At 60 bags to the
ton the freight is 6d. per bag. But if a
local grower or shopkeeper wants to send
a bag of vegetables to the next station, five
miles away, the minimum rate is Bd. per
bag, 33-j per cent, more for one-thirtieth the
distance. I don’t know' why the Hallam
Valley people alone have the privilege of con-
signment in bulk, but I think it is because
they are close to the metropolis. If you aren’t
crowded round the city in Victoria the Rail-
way Department reckons you have no right
to live.

The Search for an Archbishop.
The six clergymen and six laymen who are
searching for an archbishop to fill the
vacant Melbourne see continue to do Aus-
tralian ecclesiastics an injustice by raking
England for a nominee. The pertinent
question might be put to the committee,
several of whom have spent their lives
training Australians for a religious life,
whether the products of their teaching have
been of such inferior quality that none of
them are fitted for a job which, viewed
realistically, is no more difficult than
running a big city business or organising
the national defence. The fact is that
Australian claims have been considered only
cursorily, as was practically admitted the
great deal of the work, so that two years
before it had planned the Commission had
to find homes for 5000 or so people, and,
incidentally, satisfy a mob of politicians.
In the mad rush two contractors went broke
over housing and kerbing jobs, and Parlia-
ment House and other official buildings
were hotch-potched.
With all the pomp of the Royal opening
gone, the Commission found that to its
original job of builder had been added
that of administrator, and none of the men
comprising the Commission was an adminis-
trator. Trouble started at once. Land-
jobbers had forced up values to a ridi-
culous sum (the capital value of one
quarter-acre garage site is set down at
£11,000) and the Commission based rates
on these values. The result is that to-day
civil servants are paying as much as 10s.
a week for rates and kerbing charges on
properties which can never be their own
because of King O’Malley’s leasehold
policy. Costs of rent and foodstuffs are
higher than in most isolated towns, and
these have to be met by payment of special
allowances to the public-service residents.
The Commission has built up an enormous
staff, and the “garden” plan of the city
requires employment of upwards of 1000
laborers and maintenance men.
The residents’ troubles were eased some-
what by the granting of a representative on
the Commission. Watson found he was
impotent and got out; Alcokn is haying
troubles similar to his predecessor. Some
citizens are hoping for a Legislative Council,
similar to Papua’s; others want a Parlia-
mentary representative and a municipal
council. But with ten millions at stake the
Bruce-Pages are not likely to turn Canberra
over to a handful of locals; anyhow, not
without imposing severe restrictions.
«
Dear Bulletin, — When will Governments
consider the individual soldier settlers—not
only those in groups, where a measure of
organisation has resulted in exhaustive
inquiry, and where organisation compels
respect? No settlement man ever yet put
up the fight which is being waged by
hundreds of individual men who took up
blocks under similar conditions as to
advances and occupancy, and who have had
to face a degree of departmental harshness
reserved for the isolated Digger. Why,
settlement men are spoonfed compared with
those of us who have been hounded and
harried from one debt to another! In this
connection Lands Departments know far
more than they have the pluck to acknow-
ledge.—Yours, etc., XSA.

The Bavinshaw Government has put
Greater Sydney near the top of next ses-
sion’s list. The ancient ideal stands nowa-
days for extravagance, waste and corruption.
Few but boodlers want it. Near the bottom
of the list is an amendment of the Vagrancy
Act which will enable the police to deodor-
ise some of the city’s criminal quarters.
No one objects to the. proposed change but
the gunmen, cocaine peddlers, etc., whose
operations it will hamper. The order of
importance which these measures occupy
is a measure of the extent to which corrupt
influences can govern a well-meaning but
spineless Administration.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The rector of Port Lincoln (S.A.), just back from a visit to Central Australia, has recited a nasty oft-told tale; “The accommodation provided for half-coMc children
.at Jay’s Creek, near Alice Springs, is appalling. About 50 boys and girls, of ages ranging from 1 to 16, are herded together in one room about 48ft. by 24ft. No attempt
is made to separate the sexes.” Again and again it has been promised that this scandal would be ended; and apparently it hasn’t been ended. Above are photographs
taken a few months ago at Alice Springs by Dr. W. D. Walker. (Left) A whole family sleeps on one blanket. ( Middle) Males and females sleep alongside one another.
(Right) The ages of these people range from newly-born to 25 years. “Babies,” Dr. Walker writes, “are born in the open amongst this tangled mass of half-white-half-black
humanity without any privacy whatever.”
The special meeting of the Loan Council
brought .no gladness to Treasurer Stevens
or any of his brethren. It is feared now that
N.S.W.’s loan spendings may have to be
reduced to £8,500,000 for 1929-30, and if so
the Treasurer sees great grief ahead. Still
there remains a hope that more money may
be scratched in by unobtrusive ways. The
Treasury is always open to receive local loan
subscriptions, and it might gather in more
than it does if it kept open till 9 p.m.
instead of closing at 3 p.m. Three o’clock
is an absurdly early hour to cease borrowing.
The opening of the Federal transconti-
nental railway as far as Alice Springs pro-
duced prompt results. Freights on ordinary
merchandise from Adelaide fell from £5O to
£2O ner ton, petrol began to be sold at 3s.
per gallon instead of 65., and mining appa-
ratus became comparatively cheap. Then
animals which were practically valueless
through inability to hoof it over the 300-
mile stage to the old railhead at Oodnadatta
have acquired a price. In fact life in a
good part of Central Australia has ceased
to be an almost impossible luxury.
A “Nationalist” Government was respon-
sible for Westralia’s group settlements. A
preliminary report dealing with 327 cow
(not wheat) farms says that they owe the
State £1,113,197 in principal and back
interest, and that £733,422 should be
scratched off as lost. It was chiefly because
of the group-settlement scheme that the
Cockies fell out with ex-Premier Mitchell.
The egregious mess he made of it helped to
put him out, and it is helping to keep him
out.
The cancellation of the rural award in
Queensland has had swift results. Country
police stations report that the relief distri-
buted at the end of July was less than a
fourth of the amount handed out just before
the avalanche smote the Labor Government.
In other words, large bodies of men have
got work which farmers and graziers could
not have given them under the terms of
the award.
Tas. Assembly thinks the time has arrived
for an amendment of the Constitution to
ensure Assembly rights in regard to all
money bills. A motion to that effect emerged
out of a warm discussion on a proposal to
settle the hash of the Upstairs Gentry by
a Parliament Act on Cold Country lines.
Meanwhile the Council is apparently desir-
ous of setting up as the more democratic of
the Speck’s double-barrelled legislature. It
decided that the Occupational Diseases Act,
which the Assembly sought to postpone for a
year, should not be so postponed.
Weaver, the N.S.W. Minister of Mines,
has shocked the “Nationalist” Assoc, and
staggered his associates in the Wet Blotting-
paper Ministry by saying that “the coal
strike wouldn’t have continued so long but
for family endowment, which the miners have
come to regard as regular income”; and still
more by these explosive utterances:—
The reason for a lot of the taxes we are bearing is
that we are crawling for votes by socialistic tactics.
We are getting blind-eyed on one side and swivel-
eyed on the other. The Nationalist party is jeopard-
ising itself by monkeying with socialistic schemes.
It is all true; but what is Weaver going
to do about it? Or what are the “National-
ists” going to do about Weaver?
More first-fruits of the Defence economies
are the transfer of field and howitzer batteries
to Sydney and the drafting into the infantry
of country lads who have become keen on
their batteries. A check is also given to the
civilian rifle-club movement, which may find
itself reduced to cutting out prize meetings
for trainees. But the, spirit of resistance is
growing. A meeting of electors at Gost’ord
(N.S.W.) roundly condemned the disbanding
of the Light Horse troops at Gosford and
Ourimbah, and pledged itself to give no sup-
port to any party refusing to make adequate
provision for training. Gosford is the biggest
subdivision in the Robertson electorate, which
returns Gardner, hitherto a meek Bruce-
Page man.
Pharaoh Land is to have its “freedom”
restored; in other words it is to go back to
the rule of the old pashas, when its state was
described as “ruined, outraged and miser-
able.” A few British soldiers are to be left
to guard that great foreign-owned property
the Canal, lest another Arabi sink the ships of
all nations there and block the fairway, but
as for the lives and property of Europeans
it is stated confidently in the agreement that
King Fuad" will look after them. His dis-
respected dad failed badly to do this in
1880-82. If Egypt gets into a war despite
anything the League of Nations may attempt,
Britain* is to rush to its assistance, appa-
rently without much question about the
merits of the row. The MacDonald Ministry
doubtless thinks it is laying up treasure in
Heaven by this caper.
In 1919 Gyppo rioters butchered many
Europeans, including a party of jinarmed
British officers on a train; Egyptian police
regarded these proceedings with amused inter-
est. Two .years later the Alexandrians mur-
dered 14 Europeans and wounded 69 in the
streets of their seaport. On that occasion
France and Italy were on the point of land-
ing parties from warships when Allenby sent
tardy relief in the shape of a British regi-
ment. Next time, if the Rammacs and the
Mah moods have their way, there will be nc
British regiment; and then it may be Mus-
solini’s turn.
Judge Pike estimates the losses on sol-
dier settlement at £23,525.500 (Victoria heads
the disgraceful list with £7,721,891) and
suggests that further substantial losses are
inevitable. Certainly something will have
to be done for poor devils “who should
never have been allowed to go on the land,”
while men who are wrestling manfully, but
hopelessly, with pocket-handkerchief farms
will have to be given “sufficient areas.”
Thirty per cent, of the original Digger-settlers
have abandoned the hopeless struggle; those
who remain are in many cases getting better
results than civilian settlers where conditions
are equal, but in N. S. Wales the dice are
loaded against the Digger. Commonwealth
politicians share the guilt, but State politi-
cians are the greater criminals. It is
a pity impeachment has gone out of fashion.
A gentleman profusely decorated with
razor cuts turned up at Sydney Hospital
one evening last week, and, his wounds
having been dressed, departed with the
usual refusal to explain matters. The taxi
which brought him also disappeared hur-
riedly in the murk. There have been many
similar happenings, and an amendment of the
criminal law that will compel these mys-
terious persons to speak out or take the
consequences is overdue. It is a crime to
slash one’s brother with a razor, and it ought
to be a misdemeanor to shield the slasher.
Prime Minister MacDonald extended the
open hand of friendship to the Soviet, and
the Soviet deposited a dead cat in it. Mac-
Donald was willing, even anxious, to wel-
come another Soviet embassy in London,
though the last one had to be ejected; but
he wouldn’t pledge himself not to mention
Russia’s back debts or the need for the new
embassy to abstain from spying, stealing
official papers and conspiracy against his
Government. So the negotiations were sus-
pended. Official newspapers in Moscow are
now attacking the poor man with fury, and
demanding to know when he proposes to pay
Russia’s bill for damage done or contem-
plated. When a bear with swelled head
begins to imagine himself God, he is best
left alone.
The Maoriland Full Court has decided
that the Arbitration Court has no power
to compel any worker to belong to a union.
It is a judgment of far-reaching importance,
for many Maoriland awards contain a “com-
pulsory preference” clause providing that a
worker who neglects to join the union, or
voluntarily resigns from it, shall be dis-
missed. There is also a form of preference
governing cases in which a unionist and
a non-unionist are competing for employ-
ment ; the boss is obliged to employ the
unionist provided that gentleman is “willing
and able’’ to perform the work. But this
is of small value to the unions, the boss
being the sole judge of willingness and
ability.
N.S-W- farmers, who are being driven to
vote again on the compulsory pooling of
their wheat by threats that they will be
fined if they don’t, have been told that the
ballot thus thrust on them is a necessary
step towards an Australian-wide pool. H. Iv.
Nock, president of the N.S.W. Farmers and
Settlers, mentioned this higher aspiration
at his association’s conference last week, and
declared that a “Federal ballot” would be
“almost unanimous for a Federal pool.” It
may be so, but when the F. and S. A. sought
the co-operation of the Westralian Primary
Producers it was told very emphatically
that “any scheme having for its object gov-
ernmental control, or even control from the
Eastern States, would not be acceptable to
the growers of Westralia.” S. Aus., its
Minister Cowan reports, is also hostile; and
a “Federal” pool without S. Aus. and
Westralia would be a bad joke.
The sacking of employees in the Defence
forces and the arms factories was rotten
neglect and sacrifice of a country which
was already ill-prepared for emergencies.
Other discharges were warranted in a way
because the services were overmanned; still
it is a soulless policy which overloads
departments when times are good and private
employment is obtainable, with the certainty
that men will have to be turned adrift whole-
sale in the bitter midwinter of discontent.
Just here it is a rather gruesome joke to read
things like this :
Steady progress is being made with investigations
into the practicability ef developing the lake scheme
provided in the Griffin plan of Canberra.... If the
expense of constructing the lakes on the Griffin plan
is found too high, another scheme will be evolved.
The question of finance is now under consideration.
Such items reflect on the Government’s
sanity, if any.
The dispute between Sydney and Mel-
bourne universities over the value of Mel-
bourne’s matriculation certificates revolves
round a recent American development in
education. Melbourne Uni. authorities agree
with educationists in many other coun-
tries that annual examinations are not
always the best means of judging the intel-
ligence of a pupil, and have introduced a
system whereby colleges may grant a certi-
ficate on the merits of a student’s perform-
ance throughout the year. There is an
obvious temptation to accord certificates for
the glory of the school where they have not

The wrangle over the choice of a Labor
candidate for the vacant Leg. Council seat
in South Aus. has developed into a Donny-
brook. Following a pleasant Sunday after-
noon in the Adelaide Botanic Park, when
the leaders of the Bardolph and AVhitford
factions harangued a multitude estimated at
20,000, the party’s central council declared
the selection ballot null and void, in effect
inviting Bardolph and Whitford to fight, it
out in the electorate. Meanwhile a union
secretary has acknowledged that “as spokes-
men for prominent members of the Labor
party,” he asked old John Vartan, the
Nationalist, to stand ; and another unionist
has withdrawn his candidature for an
Assembly nomination to assist his wife, who
is opposing Whitford and Bardolph; and
Senator Daly is siding with one faction while
Yates, M.H.R., is championing the other.
And, as Edwards, one of the State members
for Adelaide, put it in the course of a pas-
sionate attack on Yates, all because “the seat
is one of the safest and best-paid Labor
seats there is.”
Knowing that McPherson can’t depend on
his nominal majority of eight.'the Vie. Labor
Opposition is treating the Government with
contempt. The adjournment of the House
was moved on two successive days, unem-
ployment and supply of coal from the State
mine to private customers being the pre-
texts. Then Tunnecliffe objected to McPher-
son speaking by leave on the decision to cut
down flhe Eildon Weir spillway. He was
within his rights; still, it is unprecedented
for objection to be raised to the head of a
Government making any announcement to
the House at the outset of a sitting. The
Premier got in his statement just before the
House rose, but the direction of business
had been taken out of the Government's
hands. The idea is, of course, to discredit
the McPherson team so that it may be
accused on the hustings of being a helpless
lot with no achievements.
South Africa would be hit, too, by the
abolition of British preferences, but not
to such an extent; its exports of sugar,
dried fruits and wine are small compared
with ours, though its export tobacco trade
is rather considerable. Wool-growing is the
S. African industry that is advancing with
rapid strides; the number of sheep is esti-
mated at 40 millions —practically two-fifths
of the Australian total —and wool exports
for 1927 were valued at £17.118.000. Still,
Afrikanders see good possibilities in tea-
growing. They have about 3250 acres under
tea, and reckon there is a lot more country
equally suitable; production amounts to
about 4| million pounds of green leaf. Why
doesn’t Australia try to grow tea instead of
importing about £4,000,000 worth every
year?
HIS PUNISHMENT.
[FR THE BULLETIN.]
‘The Labor Council has announced that no Labor
member or official will be allowed to participate in
the welcome to be accorded the Premier (Mr. Bavin)
on hia return from abroad.”
Come, break it gently to the wanderer fleeting
Back to old “Kidney Pie.” How should
he reck
There’ll be no Lang to bellow gladsome
greeting
To him the moment he appears on deck,
No Theodore a handgrip warm entreating,
No Micky Burke to fall upon his neck
With tears of joy, no beaming Paddy Stokes,
Or any, other of those Labor blokes?
Send him a radio. Tactfully and sadly
His soul for this unpleasant, shock prepare,
The dire intelligence that neither Baddeley,
Garden nor Voight nor Gosling will be
there.
But for this ukase doubtless they’d have
gladly
Given him welcome. Now they may not
dare.
11l fares it with the chap that disobeys
The lightest word the Labor Council says.
This is his punishment. No use to bandy
Hot words or fervent protests to convey.
When his boat berths there’ll be no Keegan
handy
And, willy-nilly, Dunn must stop away.
So, too, must “Bondy” Hoare and “Ironbark
Andy”
And the inevitable A. D. Kay.
What cruel hearts these petty tyrants
have!....
And what a bitter home-coming for Bav.

“Morita”: Ex-Prime Minister Iluglies’s
speech to the 4000 Diggers at the Sydney
Showground reunion must have recalled to
many another speech by the Tattle Digger in
the early days of France. Well spruced up
for the occasion, the brigade at zero hour
formed a hollow square around an ancient
farm waggon that was to serve as platform
in a peaceful farm-orchard near Sailly.
It was a hot day, Billy was hours late for
his appointment, and when the tiny figure
strode into the paddock the tired-of-waiting
troops were in the midst of a grass-and-clods

that time was busy teaching England how

“Query”: “Propellor’s” Air Force yarn
“Worth a Dozen” in a recent Bulletin is
a fine story—how fine only those who have
served in a Flying Corps, can judge—but
there is one detail to which I am moved
to take exception. During the. “dog fight”
the narrator puts his “Camel” into “the
tightest loop the Hun had ever seen.”
On one occasion word went round
the ’drome at Minchinhampton that Lieut.
James, a competent pilot, was taking
up a “Camel” to show that with proper
handling it could be looped. A crowd
gathered, and James was warned to give him-
self plenty of elbow-room. He did. He must
have climbed fully 7000 ft. before he flat-
tened out. He took his dive and then zoomed
up to make the loop. For a second or two
it looked as if he might succeed, but the
’plane rapidly lost speed until it seemed to
be hanging stationary in the air. Imen it
fell sideways, to flutter like a kite that Inis
lost its tail; a spinning nose-dive followed,
and the ’plane tore furiously earthward, spin-
ning like a top. With 4000 ft. to go we began
to feel alarmed. “Time he pulled her out,
said someone. It was only too plain that
he couldn’t, and the next thing we heard was
a sickening crash as • the ’plane smashed
through the roof of a barn half a mile away.
I never saw another serious attempt rngde
at looping ,a “Camel.”

“Kerys”: It was two o’clock on Saturday
afternoon and the young married couple
next door to mo in the Mosmau
boarding-house were clearly having
one of their periodical quarrels. I
could hear the voice of Eveline
raised in rich vituperation, and
Alf retorting in kind, and when 1
presently saw the former leaving
home with a suit-case I knew the
parting had come. I happened to
be catching the same boat, and
heard Alf s last-minute plea to her
to forgive him and come back, or,
if she wouldn't, at least to accept
a few shillings to go on with. All
overtures the lady rejected with
scorn, and bumped the suitcase on
to the ferry. As I . knew she
had no friends or relatives in Syd-
ney 1 was mildly interested in her
destination, and kept an eye on her
progress to the Botanic Gardens,
where she seated herself under a
spreading fig-tree and wept bitterly.
I left her there, having an appoint-
ment to keep ; when I returned she
had disappeared. But outside my
turnstile at the Quay a suitcase
bumped me, and a tearful voice
requested the loan of a ferry fare.
It was Eveline returning to Alf
and sanity. On the boat she told
me the full history of the quarrel,
and emphasised that her return
was solely due to her conviction
that Alf was sickening for ’flu;
otherwise she would have stayed
away for ever. Had it not been
for a trifling mishap at the gate
I might still have believed that she
really meant it. But when the
bump on the gatepost caused the
flimsy lock of the suitcase to give
way I had a momentary glimpse of
its contents. They consisted of one
pink satin slipper and a comb!
“Eureka” : Away in the desolate mountain-
ous country between Southern Monaro and
the far South Coast of N.S.W. the -mailman
used to have a very lonely trip with no com-
pany but a dog. Nowadays lie has a six-
valve radio set, and as old Dobbin jogs along
the track the .driver listens in to the latest
news and music. Once he was greeted with
such queries as “What won the Sydney Cup
last week, Joe?” Now he comes with the
latest scores in a football match that is still
in progress. “They’re over again,” he told
a passing swagman cheerfully the other
Saturday afternoon. “What’s over?” asked
the roadster bewilderedly. “Australia’s just
scored another ti - y against the All Blacks,”
and Joe whipped up his steed and left the
other to digest the information, hot from the
Sydney Gricket Ground, on the lonely slopes
of Big Jack Mountain.

“Oxmead”: It is claimed by Lowell
Thomas, the biographer of Count von Luck-
ner, that his hero, who commanded the
German raider Seeadler, is the only modern
adv e n turer wlio
rivals Lawrence of
Ar a bia. Judging
by the stories of
Von Luckner’s Aus-
tralian experiences,
years before the
war, there is some-
thing in the claim.
The Count, one
reads, deserted from
a Russian sailing-
ship at Fremantle
in the ’nineties
and joined the Sali-
vation Army. When
religion palled he
got a job as assist-
ant to the light-
house - keeper at
Cape Leeuwin, but
having been caught
kissing his boss's
liretty daughter he
left hurriedly (his
departure possibly
accelerated by the
old man’s boot),
and “rode to Port
Augusta on a stolen
horse.” A ride of
well over 2000
miles through
utterly unknown
and largely water-
less country—this
was long before the
Trans, line was sur-
veyed certainly
seems to mark out
the rider for future
distinction, and
one reads with no
particular surprise that Von Luckner became
boxing champion of Queensland before he
moved on across the Pacific.

“Candide”: We were in the front line at
Quinn’s Post where the trenches were only
a few yards apart, and Bluey had just got
one of his full-flavored yarns off his chest.
Hearing the roar of laughter, along pops our

“Naklioda”: I have a certain sympathy
with spiritualists who are charged with
imposing on people “by subtle craft,” for
it was by the exercise of such astute cunning
and nothing else that a spiritualist once
saved me from being defrauded in Java.
Some articles had vanished from my bun-
galow, and the servants were suspected.
Inquiry failed to disclose the culprit, so,
being a broadminded person, I yielded to the
importunities of a friend, and calleu in a
native witch-doctor. Summoning the ser-
vants he requested me to obtain five eggs
laid by a black fowl on a Friday. These,
he ordered to be boiled hard, and, alter
making some remarks in a language unin-
telligible to me, he handed one to each of the
suspected persons and directed that they
be swallowed, adding that the guilty one
would find his egg hatch out inside him.
All succeeded in surrounding their eggs
except the number-two “boy, ’ although lie
struggled manfully. The stolen articles
were duly found in his dwelling.

“Toowong Road’’: Brisbane lias been
pondering over a curious bit of treasure
trove, a gold Parliamentary railway pass of
a long dead M.L.A. in a distant {State. The
badge was found when some soil was being
sifted in the Botanic Gardens, said soil
having been brought from the North Quay,
as the result of excavations for the new
bridge across the Brisbane River. The North
Quay is a river-bank park in the heart of
the city, which has for many years been a
favorite resort of trysting lovers, who delight
to nestle in its shady groves and listen to
the murmuring stream. Lots of portable
articles and valuables have been picked up
there, but this is the first time there has been
a hint of Parliamentary patronage.

“Gouger”: The isle of Niuafou, of the
Tongan Group, where some of the mostly
somnolent volcanoes have been midly play-
ing up, is ruled over by Queen Salotte, a
tall and handsome young woman of Samoan
type. She was educated mostly in Maori-
land, and has paid several visits to Sydney.
Nukualofa is the capital of the tiny king-
dom, and the picturesque palace, which looks
like glistening marble, though it is merely
wood painted white, is a tropic dream among
the palms. The sovereign is surrounded by
all the pomp and ceremony and little brown
toy-soldiers that the Tongans love; but there
are no frills about the miniature Parlia-
ment. I have seen the Prime Minister attired
in a faded white lava-lava, and smoking
a huge evil-smelling cigarette, dangling
his big, bare brown feet over the end of
the tiny wharf while he dreamily gazed at
a fishing-line. Niuafou is a British protec-
torate, and, naturally, Australians have
poked their way in there, as traders, officials
and missionaries. A missioner of big ton-
nage is a brother of Earle Page, the Com-
monwealth Treasurer.

“Matakitaki” : Our grandfathers took their
earthquakes differently. In an old copy of
“Brett’s Handy Guide to New Zealand,
dated 1890, it is recorded that “in October,
1848, a violent earthquake shock occurred m
the vicinity of Cook Strait and Wellington
suffered terribly. Houses, churches and shops
were ruthlessly wrecked ; men fell on their
knees in the streets who had never prayed
since childhood ; and funds for the rebuilding
of the churches were forthcoming in a
manner that our clergy of to-day look in
vain for.” I was right through the recent
Murchison ’quake, but I fail to recall a
single instance of any praying being done;
most people were more concerned with keep-
ing on their feet. I saw one settler on his
knees and hanging on to a wire fence, but
his remarks, although fervent enough, were
not in the least like orisons.

“Ida D.”: There arc legends about lost
Jewish tribes in places far more remote from
Palestine than India or China (B. 24/7/’29).
After the conquest of Mexico, when the
Spanish penetrated to the jungles of the Cen-
tral American isthmus, they found ruined
cities and traces of a civilisation older than
the Aztec. What was stranger, the earliest
missionaries found the Cross being used as a
religious emblem and a form of baptism by
water. A very old tradition has it that St.
Thomas, on the dispersal of the Apostles
after the Ascension, somehow managed to
carry the Gospel to Central America. As
centuries passed, and no more missionaries
arrived, the people reverted to their old
religion, retaining some of the apostolic
teaching in a debased form. It is from these
regions that of quite recent years have come
persistent rumors of a tribe of “white
Indians.” In Southern Patagonia, too, there
are legends of a community of white people
living in a city—called Cesares by the
Spaniards—in some hidden valley of the
Andes. Felix San Martin refers to this city
at length in his work on the Patagonian
Indians, and I myself found many well-
informed people in South America, both Eng-
lish and Spanish, far from sceptical about its
existence.

“Centurion” : The adopted design for the
statue of Earl Haig to be erected in Lon-
don has set the Service by the ears, some
neo-Georgian sculptor having depicted the
debonair little field-marshal as a ponderous
blood-and-iron person on a lumbering draught
stallion! Haig was one of the most dashing-
cavalry officers and finest horsemen in the
British Army, and would have died rather
than throw his leg over anything but an
irreproachable bit of blood. Agonised purists
are also pointing out that the F.M. has been
given a shoulder-strap to his Sam Browne,
whereas lie notoriously fractured the canons
of Dress Regs, by refusing to wear one.
Field-marshals can do that sort of thing.

“Narara”: I can certify to one coffin that
was never buried (B. 31/7/’29). I was in
a Queensland riverside town some years ago
when the black-tracker attached to the local
police died. The force secured a substantial
coffin from the local carpenter, and after
placing the body in it handed it over to the
deceased relations for burial. Meeting two of
them some days later I asked if they had
buried Tommy properly. “Yes,” I was as-
sured, “we wrap him in blanket belonga him,
bury him near river. By cripes, boss, that
boat you put Tommy in plurry fine for
duck-shootin’.” Later I saw the “boat” in
use.

claimed to be unique occurred recently in
the Hobart public hospital. A woman was

formed before they could be brought into
the light of day. Mother and brood at latest

“Strict Veg.”: Scientists, artists and the
curious public generally had a high old time
at the expense of the two Arunta tribesmen
whom George Aiston brought down from
Central Australia for the abo. art exhibition
in Melbourne. They were photographed,
painted and interrogated to what must have
been about the limit of their endurance. What
they thought about it will never be known,
but when I watched them being prepared
for a movie picture at Eltliam I made a
guess. At the beginning of the proceedings
the older man looked positively dangerous.
He squatted sullenly apart in a mood of
black dejection, out of which blazed an occa-
sionally disconcerting gleam. Round him
Was the primeval bush, and there was not
a sign of civilisation except the people armed
with cameras, whereas he was armed with
lethal weapons he well knew' how to use.
His kindly and understanding keeper scented
trouble, and went over and talked to him
quietly for fully 10 minutes. After that
talking-to he got up and duly did his stuff:
but I could not help wondering what might
have happened to those respectable suburb-
anites if he had happened to be a Malay.

“Sir Spun”: A certain N.S.W. settler
recently appealed to the Land and Valua-
tion Court against a decision of the local
land board. After setting out the preliminary
grounds of his appeal in the customary
manner, to wit, “that the board’s finding was
against the evidence and the weight of evi-
dence,”: etc., he gave as his last-but-by-no-

would shudder at it, but at least it was
cooked; I had to come to Australia to see
bacon eaten raw. I travelled Queensland
recently with a party of Italians, some pure-
bred, others born here, and the iron-ration
they all carried was bread and rashers. The
latter they ate raw from the rind, like water-
melon ! Mighty teeth and a mightier diges-
tion must be required for a diet like that.

“Nakhoda”: The appointment of an Aus-

Singalese Buddhist College in Ceylon draws
attention to one of - the most remarkable

have been the last person to propose the
proselytising of the West. He held that
a man’s soul was his own concern, to be
saved or damned by his own unaided efrorts.
Nevertheless, a Buddhist church arose, and
some commentors say its doctrines spread as
far as Egypt, Mexico, the Balkans and Aus-
tralia. An Indian king, Asoka, made it the
State religion, and piously forced it on his
neighbors. It did not get a footing in Euro-
pean countries until Max Mueller, Rhys
Davids and others translated the sacred
texts. Since then it has become a fashion-
able creed in London, Paris, Berlin and

“Strict Veg.” : Melbourne garden lovers view
with misgivings a recent remark of director
Ilae, to the effect that the scientific aspect
of the Botanic Gardens had progressively
declined till they had come to be regarded as
little more than a pleasure resort. Mere
unscientific humans want to know what
higher purpose they could serve. Guilfoyle
w r as the man who made the Gardens world-
famous and he was a landscape gardener
first of all. He was a genius who used
horticulture as a medium for obtaining
beauty by the most economical means. Some
of his effects still remain, but others have
mysteriously disappeared. Niggling flower-
beds have broken up the majestic sweep of
his lawns and meaningless shrubberies have
murdered vistas which made the place seem
like a fragment of infinity dropped into the
squalid present of Melbourne’s brick-and-
mortar chaos. It would be easy to make the
Gardens more valuable to botany students by
stuffing them with more specimens, but unless
it is done by a man with the fine sensi-
bilities of Guilfoyle, Melbourne will wake up
one day to find one of its finest features
gone.

“Bad Australian” : Those railway employees
(B. 10/7/’29) who declared that the round-
house at Grey mouth (M.L.) showed signs
of rotating during the recent earthquake
were probably stating a fact. The great
earthquake that rattled Valparaiso in
August, 1906, did a considerable amount of
damage in the Chilian capital as well, and
one of the first things the Santiagueno points
out to a visitor to his city is a four-sided
stone column in a plaza near the Mapocho
Bridge with the terminal stone slewed around
at an angle of about 45 degrees from its
original position. If this was not the result
of a rotating movement, how did that stone
change its position?

“Benno” : I have been sorely puzzled over
the genesis and derivation of many slang
phrases, including “pulling your leg” and
“getting the wind up,” but the verb to “do
in,” as a synonym for “kill,” has me abso-
lutely beaten. I used to think it was entirely
Australian, but it was more likely imported
from Cockaigne. You are apt to encounter
it, among other excerpts from the under-
world argot, at any stage of a case which
centres round a crime of violence. How does
to “do in” come to mean to “murder” —
oneself or anyone else? And what is the
noun that has dropped out to permit of
what must be about the briefest euphemism
on record to denote the taking of human
life?

“Barangkali” : The theory of “Historicus”
that Horj and his waliine are the descendants
of Israel’s lost tribe is one that would have
commended itself to Captain Cook. In his
journal he writes: “These natives [Maoris]
did not scruple to make any advantage of us,
and would, therefore, when they had received
the price of anything they had offered to sell,
pack up both the purchase and the purchase
money with all possible composure as so
much lawful plunder.”

“Sir Spen”: The spirit of the gambler
recently penetrated the tangle of prickly-
pear and hopbush scrub surrounding a little
farm in a remote corner of the Ma State, and
flashed a gleam of hope across the brain of
a settler there, who was evidently fighting
a losing battle. After telling his tale of
woe in a letter to the Minister for Lands, and
suggesting that someone else might, be able
to “make a do of it,” he finished : “I would
like your permission to hold an art lottery
for the place, same as the Golden Helmet,

“Chevroford”: It has always been a mys-
tery to me why, in this supposedly demo-
cratic country, railway travel for the aver-
age unmoneyed person has not been made
more comfortable, not to say decent. The
horrors of a night journey between two Aus-
tralian capitals, when the traveller is un-
able to afford a first-class ticket, need no
stressing. In most European countries
.second-class sleepers are the rule, and in
some there is excellent accommodation even
in the third-class. In Russia before the
war the second-class was so comfortable that
only Grand Dukes worried about the premier
class at all. I put in 14 days and nights on a
Russian second-class, train, and suffered far
less than I have done in travelling for one
night between Melbourne and Sydney. The
accommodation for sleepers involves no very
radical alteration to carriages. The four-berth
compartment can be converted into a sleeper
by the addition of upper bunks that in the
daytime are turned back against the wall.
All the privacy required can be provided by
putting the sexes in separate compartments,
and even if passengers were obliged to bring
their own blankets they would gladly do so
for the privilege of being able to stretch
out flat. Clapp and his fellow-Commissioners
complain of motor competition, yet when this
simple reform w r as put before them for the
umpteenth time the other day they returned
the stereotyped answer that it wouldn’t pay.

the British-Australian-New Zealand-Antarc-
tic Research Expedition. As the full title
is too much of a mouthful for these strenu-
ous days, it seems pretty certain the coined
word will come into popular use. Although
he has never openly disapproved of “Anzac”
or “Bawra,” I am anxious to see how Judge
Curlewis will welcome this latest unauthor-
ised addition to our terminology.

“Coaldust”: A recent sly-grog case at
Rockhampton (Q.) threw some rather start-
ling sidelights on home-brewed stimulants.
One witness mentioned that at near-by Goo-
vigen he had seen men put methylated spirits
into a saucepan, set the stuff alight, and
burn off what they called “the fluff.” Ginger-
beer was then added. Which reminds me
that I once witnessed in Belmore Park, near
Central Station (Sydney), the manufacture
of what was dubbed “derelict’s cocktail.”
The total cost was elevenpence—sixpenno’rth
of “meth.” and a bottle of ginger-beer. About
one-fourth of the ginger-beer was emptied
out of the bottle to make room for the
“meth.” The mixture was vigorously shaken
for about 10 minutes, the cork being removed
at intervals to permit of the gas escaping.
Then the cocktail was pronounced ready for
consumption. I saw the process on several
occasions, but I never knew the Belmore
Park distillers to bother about burning off
“the fluff.”

“Elsie Ghee”: She wms a Melbourne girl
paying her first visit to Sydney, and one. of
the historic spots she was bent on seeing
was that much-paragraphed rendezvous with
Death, The Gap. Friends directed her to
take the Watson’s Bay tram and told (( the
approximate location of Suicide Point. “Oh,
that’s all right,” said she; “I’ll get the tram-
conductor to tell me where to get off!” She
was promptly warned against that course
on the ground that a Sydney tramguard's
first thought in the circumstances -would be
to ’phone to the police. The girl refused to
credit this until the fatal spot was neared
and she found herself the sole female on the
tram. When the conveyance was stopped at
a wayside post and the conductor, stepped off
to open the staff-change box, it was too
much for her. She alighted hurriedly and
walked ostentatiously away from the Gap’s
direction! “When the conductor actually did
get off to ’phone,” she told her friends on
her return, “I didn’t care if I never saw r your
old Gap!” And she went back home without
seeing it.
* * * *
“Orsen Gig”: Parents desiring to find
romantic and euphonious names for their
female offspring might give the amatory
poets a spell and turn to the standard herd-
test reports. Besides such essentially bovinr
names as Aroma and Alfalfa, I find some-
thing to linger over in Gwyneth, Joybelle,
Junette, Zona, Colina and Clementine,
while Kirsty warms the cockles o’ ma Scottish
hairt. And when the milker’s place of resi
dence is joined to her heifer name some of
the combinations would gladden the soul of
any poet. Here are a few: Dainty Lass of
Carney Dell, Araluen Chloe, Karoola Honey-
bee, Leonie of Clarendon Eyre, Glengowrie
Eleanor and Airmaid of the Falls —the last
possibly a fencer. It seems a pity all these
jewels of names should be wasted on the
brute creation, however rich and plentiful
their milk may be. And there isn’t a Straw-
berry among the lot!

“Blink Bonnie” : The fastest of the Union
company’s fleet is the crack ferry steamer
Wahine, which in the early days of the war
put up the record time of 21 days 3 hours
for the passage to England via Panama.
Then a brand-new craft, she was at once
requisitioned as a despatch ship in the
Mediterranean, and on occasions touched 32
knots. On her present run between Welling-
ton and Lyttelton she habitually manage
her 24 knots. Such is the luck of shipbuild-
ing that other craft constructed to precisely
the same specifications have failed to yield
anything near the Wahine’s turn of speed.
* * * *
“John B.”: As an offset to the Digger
who remained a non-com. for five years (B.
31/7/’29), I can tell of a private who was
mess-orderly one day and orderly-officer the
next. He was Frank Johnstone, of tbe
33rd Battalion. It wms at Messines, where
practically every officer of the company was
put out of action within the 39 days
we spent on the ridge. Frank was a good
sort, and nobody grudged him his startlingly
rapid promotion.

“Shop” : It is a saddening reflection that
the only hostility showm to -Australian War
Pilgrims came in one of the sectors where
Australian graves are thickest. Fromelles
lies just over the border from the scene of
the incident, and Ypres not far back in Bel-
gium. Cabled reports only bear out recent
Bulletin pars, that Flanders, unlike France
and Belgium, didn’t go out of its way to
honor the Digger, or indeed any of its
defenders. The population scattered along
each side of the hard-to-define frontier seemed
a race of their own. The French further
south w T ere hostile to them, whilst the W al-
loons of Belgium made little secret of their
opinion that only the sudden German in-
vasion had throwm the Flemings on the side
of the Allies. Their rudeness and coldness
to the Pilgrims will be resented as much
around Charleroi and Brussels as in the
villages of the Somme.

“Vero” : The late J. J. Hi filer, Australia’s
most gifted wmter-colorist, evidently pursued
his early studies in monochrome. On the
wall of a room in a large house near Bega-
South Coast (N.S.W.), is a patch of curi-
ously-involved and very delicate brush-
strokes, all in Payne’s grey. Ililder dwelt
there when employed in the Bega branch of
the Bank of N.S.W., in the days before h>
became famous. While living there he used
to do pretty little sketches from his bed-
room window, and gave them to friends.
The old mansion which houses the trea-
sure stands on a large block of land
given to the C. of E. by T. S. Mori
about 1860, and it was used for many years
as a rectory, the Rev J. L. Knight—a mW
cricketer—being the first incumbent. Hi'
two sons became bishops. Then came Canon
Faunce, uncle of General “Bull” Kyrie.
WOOL AWAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Every succeeding winter sees more furs worn in
Australia.... Women could please the squatters by
wearing woollen coats instead of furs.” —Augus.
To blazes with marten and skunk and Rey-
nard, grey, silver or red,
Not to tnention the numerous things that
Bunny becomes when lie’s dead!
What with cost of production so high, and
price of his staple so low,
The brow of the squatter is creased and well
might he wail in his woe.
Ah, me! How his forehead would light and
his heart be of thankfulness full,
Could be waken to look on a world where
women were coated in wool!
Though never so fleecy his flocks, he watches
his profits decline
Through silk that from fibre is spun and
goods in the sniafil line.
O dames who are stately in seal, O damsels
who ermine have donned,
Have you never a heart for a him who is
hard by the Slough of Despond?
Leave sables to sirens by Seine and beaver
to belledom of Bull,
And lighten the grazier’s lot by walking
through winter in wool!
O madams in musquash and mink top-
dressed who complacently go.
Cut out your exotic attire and give the
merino a show.
For the outlook is gloomy and grey, the
pastoral industry slumps,
And the squatter is doleful indeed and down
in the depths of the dumps.
What a rift would he glimpse in the clouds!
What a different face would he pull!
How he’d whoop if he woke in a world where
womankind weltered in wool!

Ernest Baynes was in his customary
place as president when Queensland’s Royal
Show opened in Brisbane this week. Baynes
can remember when it was a very modest
affair compared with the great thing it has
become; his experience as a helper goes back
to the ’eighties. A big man in the meat trade,
he has catholic sporting interests, with a
life-long* preference for horses. He has
judged hacks and hunters at the Sydney
R.A.S.
J. F. Ward is to succeed W. R. Bayly
as head of Prince Alfred School, Adelaide,
at the end of the year. Himself a Prince
Alfred product, he took a B.A. at Adelaide

appointed chairman of the Royal
Commission to inquire into the conduct
of unregistered and proprietary racing
in Queensland.
Uni. in 1903, and the M.A. later, with all
sorts of honors. Since then he lias taught
at Rockhampton and Charters Towers (Q.)
and at his old school; and for the last seven
years he has been head of Wesley College,
Perth. Ward is 46.
There are no frills about Vic. Premier
McPherson. He usually arrives at Parlia-
ment House by tram, and he recently gave
prestige to the “Better Footpath” move-
ment, which is sweeping Melbourne sub-
urbs, by removing the front fence of his
historic Hawthorn home.
N.S.W. pressmen will miss a friend when
E. M. Lawton, Consul-General for the
U.S.A., leaves for home at the end of the
month. The big-hearted American always
remembered his own newspaper beginnings
and was a brother to all journalists. He
counts the years he has spent in Australia
as among the most interesting of his career,
and lie will carry away a stock of good
stories to add to those he tells so breezily
about his adventures in Mexico and Central
America.
Lord Strickland, who lias now fallen out
with the Vatican
as well as his army
of critics in Malta,
put in 13 years in
Australia (1904-
17) as Governor of
the Speck, Groper-
land and the Ma
State successively.
Even in those days
he had a vast
capacity for get-
ting into hot water,
and there were
periods, both in
Perth and Sydney,
when his relations
with Ministers
Were the reverse
of cordial. Yet lie
found time for
social amenities. In
Westralia he hit on
an innovation in
an annual dinner
to Oxford and
Cambridge men, or
as many as he
could collect, at
Government House.
Strickland is a
wealthy man of a
very old English
family it i s
claimed that seven
generations of his
ancestors sat for
Westmoreland in
pre - Elizabethan
Parliaments but
he must be work-
ing, and, incident-
ally, involving him-
self in violent con-
troversies, even at
68.

’Pile widow of Alfred Deakin, who was
thrice Prime Minister, was present at St.
Tvilda Town Hall when her son-in-law Tom
White was declared elected as M.11.R. for
Balaclava. White beat Francis by 12,579
votes. Mrs. Deakin’s other son-in-law, Her-
bert Brookes, is High Commissioner for
Australia in U.S.A.
Here and there in Westralia there are still
a few old-time political prisoners who can
remember Boyle O’Reilly, but Robert Hood,
who passed out in Perth the other day, had
a still earlier association with Fenianism.
He was one of the bhoys who invaded Canada
after the U.S. Civil War. He marched over
the border with a Chicago unit. Hood sur-
vived the episode 63 years. For many years
he was a photographer at Broken Hill: he
was a silverfields pioneer.
The Wilsons of Bald Hills, a few miles
north of Brisbane, are a little Education
Department in themselves. The father of the.
family is head teacher at the Bald Hills
school. He married a teacher, and their five
children, two girls and three boys, became
teachers, though the daughters have since
married.
Vic. Railways Minister Groves had the
floor in the Lower House the other day,
when a member interjected. “I’m not
skiting,” said Groves indignantly before the
interjector could finish his remark. “I didn’t
say you were skiting,” the member ex-
plained; “I said you were skiting—on thin
ice!”
.1. S. Purdy, who succeeds Ralph Hutchin-
son as N.S.W. president of the Diggers’
League, is familiar to all Sydneysiders as
City Health Officer. A Geordie, polished at
Aberdeen University, he has been many
things in many lands, always in a medical
capacity, and he is a veteran of tw T o wars.
In the South African trouble he was a quack
with Plumer’s flying column; in the 1914-18
business he saw service in Egypt, Gallipoli
and France, where he commanded the 10th
Australian Field Ambulance, collecting a
colonelcy and the D.S.O.
After 53 years’ service at Vic. Govern-
ment Printing Office, W. A. G. Hindfc, press
sub-overseer, is to see how the world wags
outside. He joined as an imp when he was
under 12, and was a supernumerary after
he had gone through the training mill; they
were thorough in apprenticeship matters in
the middle ’seventies. A wallet of bank-
notes was the parting gift of the companion-
ship. .T. 11. Van Prooyen succeeds.
William Sowden, who was editor of the
Adelaide Register for 24 years, has returned
from a visit to “the East” convinced that
Australia is neglecting a big potential cus-
tomer. The brown lands are an old friend
and enemy of the ex-president of the S. Aus.
A.N.A. His first visit was made a genera-
tion ago. Ten years afterwards he still had
a memento of a fortnight’s stay in Sourabaya
in the shape of attacks of malaria acquired
immediately after landing at that then
insanitary port.
A bequest of £20,000 to the Knox Home
for Incurables at Auckland (M.L.) has a
remote connection with the lesser Aapo-
leon’s attempt to foist Maximilian on the
Mexicans as Emperor. The goodwill of
Napoleon not being sufficient, _ Maximilian
bonds were issued to raise the wind. Harker,
a manufacturing chemist in England, put
£70,000 out of his pile of £lOO,OOO on Maxi-
milian. The execution of that ill-fated Aus-
trian made the bonds even less valuable
than German marks were to become in 1920.
Harker took the balance of his fortune to
M.L., and there he increased it; it is his
daughter who has given the money to the
Knox Home.
McPherson’s announcement that he will
introduce a bill to regulate the supply of gas
and the maximum charge for it recalls that
when another Vic. Government brought for-
ward a measure on the same lines in October,
1914, the Metropolitan Co. offered success-
ful resistance. To emphasise its objections
to some of the provisions the co. sent counsel
to the bar of the Assembly. Irvine, now
C.J. of Vic., and Starke, now on the High
Court Bench, were the barristers briefed.
Irvine’s address occupied 10£ pages of Han-
sard. Starke was offered an opportunity to
supplement what his learned brother had
said, but declined in eight words. Irvine
was then in the Reps.; he became State
C.J. 34 years later.
The new N.S.W. Council of the R.S.L. is
short two legs and two arms. Roland Green,
M.H.R. for Richmond, and Gordon Wilkins,
who founded the Wellington branch, have
only one leg each —Wilkins lost his other
pedal extremity at Bullecourt. Albert
Kelaher and Francis Robinson each left an
arm on the other side, Robinson on Gal-
lipoli.
C. E. Doepel, of Dopeltbn (N.S.W.), went
to sea when only nine years old. At 49
he manned his first drogher on the Bellin-
gen, and in process of time he had a fleet
of droghers. When ships ceased to call at
Bellinger Heads Doepel converted his biggest
craft and set sail for Sydney loaded up with
farm produce. Next year the Bellinger was
built to his order; then came the Alma
Doepel—she now runs between Melbourne
and Tas. for the Jones jam concern. A
third Doepel fleet arrived, all steamers; the
first was the Bellinger, wrecked at Nani-
bueea Heads. The tireless old man also
started numerous sawmills about Bellingcn
and the Dorrigo. He was 75 when the end
came the other day at his East Bellingcn
mill.
Robert Bruce Burnside, Westralia’s senior
puisne Judge, died
in harness last
week, at 67. He
had been ,on the
Bench for 27 years ;
pridr to that he was
Crown Prosecutor.
Burnside came of
legal stock; his
father, after hold-
ing appointments in
the Wjest Indies,
became Chief Jus-
tice of Ceylon; the
son was born in
the Bahamas. He
was a hard-work-
ing and essentially
human Judge; for
years Arbitration
Court work was
piled on his should-
ers and his strong
commonseuse and
the conversational
atmosphere he in-
troduced into pro-
ceedings made him
more popular with
Labor than any of
his predecessors in
the job. Sw a n
River yachtsmen
will miss him, for
he was one of
them for many
years.

’nineties and soon made his way to
the front. He acquired substantial in-
terests on the goldfields and in Perth,
won a seat in the Leg. Council and
became one of the foundation members of
the Senate. (He was second on the poll
and is the second of the half-dozen to pass
out; E. A. Harney was the first.) Matheson
didn’t offer himself again in 1906; the
remainder of his life was spent partly in
Maoriland and partly in Scotland. In 1920
he came into a baronetcy on the death of
a half-brother. The title now passes to a
younger full brother; Sir Alex, had three
sons, but all of them fell in the war. His
mother was a grand-daughter of Spencer
Perceval, the Prime Minister who was assas-
sinated in the House of Commons over a
century ago.
The memorial windows in Christ Church,
Maryborough (Vic.), just dedicated, were
hardly needed to keep green the memory
of Alfred Richard Outtrim. Outtrim’s monu-
ment is the elaborate Maryborough railway
station, built at his instance. When he was
a Minister under Munro and Shiels (1890-
93) nothing pleased him better than for
a metropolitan daily to pitch into him for
the “waste of money” on that station; it
was the sort of criticism that consolidated
his majority. Always a Radical, Outtrim
went over to Labor in 1911, and was Min-
ister for Mines under George Elmslie for 13
days in 1913, but he left that party during
the war.
, Mohamad Pdsha Mahmood, one of the
moving spirits in negotiating the Anglo
Egyptian treaty, is the son of a wealthy

Sent to Oxford, he did well, and was made

he was a provincial governor, but, feeling

himself slighted, he became embittered with
the British regime, and swung into line with
the extreme wing of the Nationalists. This
he later deserted for the so-called Liberal
Constitutional party. The gentleman lias
now achieved his ambition of becoming Prime
Minister of Egypt. He is a sort of Egyptian

so humble as that continuous office-holder.

officer of the N.S.W. Statistical Bureau;
Miss Hindle is a graduate of Syd-
ney University. It is an unofficial body, an!
its constitution is similar to that of the
Associated Institute of International Affairs.
The Australian branch of the latter body
once held a debate in Sydney, and, not
having read its own rules closely, passed a
resolution affirming its belief in the White
Australia policy. This it submitted to head-
quarters in the Old Smoke, only to be tartly
reminded that the institute as an institute
had no opinion on such a subject, it being
merely an organisation for the exchange of
individual views.
The conferment of a barony on Baden Powell
will recall to the Australians who served
under him in the Imperial forces and the Con-
stabulary in South Africa many idiosyn-
crasies of the “hero of Mafeking,” who gave
a new word to the language. Like all his
family, he was eccentrically brilliant. He
never quite fulfilled early promise as a
soldier, though he undoubtedly struck a vein
at last in the Boy Scout movement. __ A
brother, who was A.D.C. to Sir Henry Nor-
man when that gentleman was Governor of
Queensland, was another soldier of unusual
parts. His hobby was aviation in a day
when anyone dabbling in it was. regarded as
qualified for an asylum. The man-lifting
kites invented by him w r ere in use in the
army years prior to the Great War.

he took an Adelaide party through the hills
to the annual race meeting at Oakbank. and

THE VOW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“When I get out of this,” you said that night
at Pozieres,
“No one shall know from what I say that
I was ever there.
I’ll hear you fellows talk, perhaps, of how
you did your bit.
And you can talk, but this I know I shall
not speak of it.
“Not for the praise men might bestow upon
a ‘gallant lad’
Will I admit that I was here when all the
world was mad.
Not for the beer that they might buy, how-
ever great my thirst,
Will I confess that I was here and saw meu
at their worst.”
Do you remember yet, old man, the vow you
made in haste
On that black night when you but saw the
tragedy and waste,
When like lost souls the big shells whined
above a world bereaved,
And all was ruin and despair and horror
unrelieved?
It’s far, far back to Pozieres, to where you
made your vow,
And it may be that, looking back, you see
things clearer now.
For though we saw men at their worst —a
worst by us unguessed—
Now do we know we saw them, too, when
they were at their best?
1 know not how the years between far
Pozieres and now
Have dealt with you, nor do I know if you
have kept your vow.
But well I know that you were blind that
night at Pozieres:
You missed, somehow, the comradeship that
saves men from despair.

KEEPING THE BRUTE QUIET.
PRIME MINISTER BRUCE: “Well, I’ve thrown him all the bones I can think of. Can’t somebody suggest another one?
HOME MINISTER ABBOTT: “Is this any good, sir?”
“C.Q.”: If Jack Cannot had postponed his
suicide another day he would have obtained
the job the lack of which led him to take
his life. Percy Crawford, manager of Mel-
bourne Tivoli, had wired Sydney asking
for his address, as he was wanted for a
new revue co.
“C. 8.”: No more extraordinary mistake
has been’ made than the bringing out of
Walter Richardson, full-blooded negro, to
star in “Show Boat” for the Firm. His
chief item was to have been the singing of
“Ole Man River,” a fine spirituelle. But
Richardson’s voice happens to be a tenor,
whereas the song calls for a deep baritone.
Wherefore the part was taken by a white
Australian, Colin Crane.
“Cauboy” : One of the cpiaintest spectacles
in Melbourne is the conducting of Jan Rubini
at the Capitol. This picture palace, which
was designed by Burley Griffin and is still
the most impressive-looking theatre in the
city though several ornate structures have
been built since, stands outside the two big
groups in the Australian cinema world, and
when the talkies came with a rush its pro-
prietors were seriously concerned. They
therefore imported Rubini from U.S.A., and
Ilubini delivered the goods. His conducting
was a revelation. As an exhibition ot
eurhythmies it was superb. ’Twas as pretty
to watch as a Pavlova ballet. So subtle and
varied were his movements that one got the
impression that he was not so much directing
the violins and the drums as playing them
bv some form of telegraphy himself. The
result was that the Capitol not only retained
its regular clients, but acquired more. Nar-
row-minded pedants may have their own
ideas about the quality of the music Jan
purveys; but there is no doubt he provides
a first-class show.
“L.S.” • The Zionist National Anthem
(“Cauboy,” B. 17/7/’29) was not composed
shortly after the Balfour Declaration. It
is an old Bohemian folk-melody; Smetana
uses it in liis “Bohemian Symphony.” It
is known by Jews as “Hatikvah,” . or Song
of Hope, the He'brew words having been
written by Imber. Why the melody should
have been adopted by them as a. national
song it is impossible to say, but its plain-
tiveness appeals to Jews.
“Stellsby” : Lord, how these critics quibble !
When in reply to “Cine Ma’s” first par. I
suggested that “concert-goers were a dwind-
ling race” I referred solely (as did “Cine
Ma” at the time) to the small audiences of
the visiting virtuosi in Melbourne. Accord-
ing to Webster a virtuoso is a “master per-
former on a musical instrument.” He can-
not, therefore, be a whole symphony orches-
tra or a philharmonic show, as “Cine Ma”
in an amended statement (B. 17/7/’29)
would have us believe.. I know unmusical
people who would consider it money wasted
to buy a ticket for a Kreisler concert, yet
will rush cheap symphony orchestral per-
formances and 75 per cent; complimentary
philharmonic shows. I don’t call them con-
cert-goers. They are just plain lovers of
noise, principally Scots, and in many in-
stances are entirely absorbed in the panto-
mimic gestures of the conductor. Indeed, the
orchestral conductor at one prominent Mel-
bourne talkie house is a greater draw than
the squawkie.
“L.H.P.”: “Brewster’s Millions,” revived
in Sydney by Leon Gordon, was first staged
in Australia at the Sydney Royal on October
26, 1907. Thomas Kingston • played Brew-
ster, and the long supporting cast of 24
included Mrs. Robert Brough, Lily Tither-
adge, Nellie Fergusson, Florrie Gleeson,
Maurice Dudley, Jimmy Atliolwood, Gregan
McMahon, Leonard Willey, Rege Carey and
Vivian Edwards.
“Craiser”: His Majesty’s .scene-shifters
will have to work harder than‘navvies from
Aug. 3 on. “Show Boat” has 17 scenes, and
they range from representations of the
Chicago World’s Fair to the deck of a
Mississippi river boat.
“C.R.”: Intellectual dramatists commonly
complain that there is no money in the
intelligent drama, and hence they are martyrs
to art. Well, “Journey’s End,” is as intellec-
tual as you please; yet R. C. Sherriff. as a
result of writing this one play is made for
life. The fact is that much so called “intellec-
tual drama”- may deserve the adjective but
seldom earns the noun.
“C. 8.”: Touching the meaning of music
(B. 17/7/’29). About 17 years ago a con-
troversy broke out in London as to which of
the arts was the greatest. To settle the issue
representative sculptors, painters, novelists,
etc., were invited to a concert. I only
remember the verdict of one man, _ but it
v«ts interesting. Joseph Conrad said that
music was obviously a lesser art than writing
because, whereas a novel was self-explana-
tory, the meaning of a piece of music had
to be printed on the programme. About 49
prominent musicians promptly pointed out
that the explanation was printed because of
the deficiencies not of music but of Conrad.
“Craiser”: Another k.o. for the legitimate
theatre is claimed to have been scored with
the proposal to turn the Princess, Melbourne,
into a talkie shop. But that large, rococo-
looking amusement hall never had much of
a dramatic reputation to lose. During the
last few years it has been closed a good deal
of its time, and when it has opened it has
usually been for the purposes of an Ameri-
cano musicomedy or melodrama. There was
a season of grand opera there two years ago,
but it was a second-rate co. which failed to
attract enormous crowds even at the mod-
erate prices asked. Melbourne, as a fact,
has had a couple too many legitimate theatres
for years, and if some of them go talkie it
will be all to the good—while if some of the
remainder are pulled down and rebuilt it
will be better still.
“S.”: Any doubts as to the reality of the
musical renaissance in Melbourne were dis-
pelled when the city health authorities seri-
ously considered taking proceedings against
the gentlemen responsible for Fritz Hart’s
symphony concerts at the Town Hall for
overcrowding one recent Saturday night.
The present writer can testify to the fact
that there were hundreds squatting in the
aisles and ranged along the walls, while hun-
dreds more disconsolately w’andered home or
possibly adjourned to the talkies. The popu-
larity of the Hart concerts might be said to
be due to the cheap prices—one and two shil-
lings—but the Heinze concerts on alternate
Saturdays run to 7s. 6d., and for them
too the “house full” notice has to be dragged
out of the basement.
“Fauteuil” : With the end of the Marlow -
Rolls ventures the varying fortunes of
Wirths’ Olympia, now known as the Green
Mill, over Princes Bridge, Melbourne, take
another turn. Being closed as a dance hall
awaiting the building of the new theatre for
that partnership, it was the scene of the
Smith-Lindrum billiard match. Priminister
Bruce looked in during the progress of this
game. Rumors about its future include a
revival of roller skating, another wrestling-
arena or a lingerie factory.
“Craiser”: Colin Crane, the young Aus-
tralian who, at short notice, took the part
in Melbourne of an imported negro and suc-
cessfully negotiated the big singing role in
“Show Boat,” is a Sydney boy. The Taits
drafted him from the Philharmonic Society
into the august company of Harry Lauder,
with whom he toured for a year. He has
figured in several musical shows, including
“The Desert Song.”
“A. Major”: “Cine Ma” and his “eminent
authorities” (B. 7/8/’29) may be right in
saying the “Appassionato” Sonata was well
named. As Beethoven himself refused to dis-
cuss the meaning of his music and refrained
from labels, there’s -wide scope for imagimv-
tion. But I can’t concur in the startling
theory that “except in the Sixth Sym-
phony” the Man of Bonn “sedulously avoided
describing natural phenomena.” The whole
of the “Waldstein” Sonata and the opening
movement of the “Moonlight” give unmis-
takable evidences of having been inspired
by such phenomena, to go no further. As to
the unerring unanimity with which flicker
orchestra conductors fit melodies to movies,
I should say that the fact that the careful
folk of Hollywood send out a minutely
detailed musical prescription with each film
has something to do with it.
“Craiser”: Those who prefer spectacle to
drama are getting their money’s worth in
“Show Boat.” It contains two miles of
timber and canvas, 730 different costumes,
220 wigs and 310 pairs of boots and shoes.
“Cauboy”: The cast of “Journey’s End,”
the war play at Melbourne Comedy, is not
only composed entirely of males. It is also
very nearly composed of Reggies. Included in
it ' are Reginald Tate, Reginald Dane,
Reginald Wykeham and Rege Carey.
“Bill O’C.” (from London) : It moves —
and pretty radically too ! Old-time stage
managers can recall their occasional diffi-
culty to induce a “legitimate” actress to don
tights, or to appear in parts calling for
bare feet, such as Trilby. As for suggesting
a wholly bare leg!—or torso !! At present
three legitimate plays (two of them
tragedies) are running in London or New
York or both, which require practically all
the ladies in the cast, from the lead down,
to appear at some time, and in one case
for all the time, in the “near-nood" rig of
the modern cabaret dancer, with occasional
demonstrations of their art. “My Girl
Friday” is farcical comedy dealing with the
sporting, but innocent, adventures of ladies
of that class ; getting so close to the knuckle
in dialogue and action that the Censor had
to whisper in the producer’s ear and get its
naughtiness modified. “Carnival” is pure
tragedy—-that of the professional “hoochy-
coochy” artist, who falls in love with a
rustic innocent and solves her problem in
the only way possible, outside the “pitchers,”
but it moves strongly and inevitably to its
end. The third, “Broadway,” is tragic melo-
drama, but worth while if only for its strik-
ing and convincing picture of one facet of
New 7 York life under prohibition. The
whole action is behind the stage of a cheap
night club, where dancers, bootleggers, detec-
tives and their respective parasites fight out
their drama -with the occasional use of guns.
The types are well drawn and the story
looks real, even if it is a bad ad. for Uncle
Samuel’s panacea. The “good girl” walks out
triumphant, bare legs, torso and all.
“Fade Out”: Peter Dawson (R.P.
17/7/’29) hits the bull’s-eye when he says
that the Australian public does not want
educational pictures. He might have added
that the only educational films which excite
any real attention from tlie man (or woman)
in the street are those which deal with sex,
Y.D., and similar subjects—and even then
k is the promise of something smutty which
generally draws the crowds. In recent years
the only travel picture which the public
really appreciated w 7 as “Chang,” the Siam-
ese jungle movie-; tyit its Sydney season was
not nearly so long as that of “False Shame, ’
the German sex educator, in the same city.

Like all good art, “Journey’s End,” tlie
war play which opened at Melbourne Royal
on Saturday, is so simple in plot as to sound
almost banal on paper. There is only one
set —an officers’ dug-out before St. Quentin.
There are only seven characters (except; tor
ihe humble supernumerary common soldier )
and they are all males. There is only one
theme —the reactions of this small microcosm
of the British army—of any army—to the
fact that the army opposite is preparing to
attack at an hour and on a date which hayc
been ascertained from enemy prisoners.
Those reactions are fundamental and have
nothing to do with the poppycock served
out by recruiting orators. There is no
raving about the glory of war, or the futi-
lity and beastliness thereof, either; though
there are complaints about the quality of
the souji and the absence of pepper (“A war
with pepper is had enough, but a war with-
out pepper is simply bloody,” says Second-
Lieutenant Trotter).
There is, in short, not the shadow of an
attempt to turn the stage into a pulpit, and
it is this that makes the play so effective.
Its author, R. 0. Sherriff, is an artist in
that he never once exceeds the limits of his
medium. You can’t tell from his drama
whether he is a Conservative, a Communist,
a Norman Aiigellite or an anarchist. _ All
that you can safely say is that he is a
realist. lie simply takes a slab of life and
records it as he sees it. Tlie result is a
picture so true to nature and so universal
ia its language that it can he under-
stood by anybody. As an illustration of
which fact it is being played in Berlin in
English with English characters at matinees
and in German with German characters in
the evening.
Fear is the dominant emotion in the. dug-
out. Like all human emotions, it manifests
ELMA GIBBS, lending in a revival of "The Patsy,” at Sydney
Criterion.
itself in an infinite variety of ways. The
simple mind reacts from fear sensually; as
a jellyfish does from a piece of rock, it recoils
instinctively. The more complex mind feels
it imaginatively. A fine mind coupled to a
weak will breaks down under the strain.
A fine mind coupled to a strong will faces it
and overcomes it one way or another.
Second-Lieutenant Trotter is a fat sensualist.
He overcomes his distaste for having been
put in a position where he may at any
moment be untidily turned into an unfeel-
ing corpse by joking about the jam. Lieut.
Osborne, an ex-schoolmaster, sidesteps it with
an elderly philosopher’s soul-weariness, a
decent man’s regard for good behavior at ail
times and by reading "Alice in Wonderland.
He has just returned from leave, which he has
spent in the bosom of his family making a
rockery. Second-Lieutenant Hibbert has a
sensitive mind and a weak will. He feigns
neuralgia in order to escape into. the back
line. Second-Lieutenant Raleigh is an 18-
year-old boy drafted straight from school
into the adult horrors of Armageddon. He
is still stuffed with youthful ardors and
romantic delusions about military glory.
Fear as yet is only for him a vague, incom-
prehensible murmur, like the mumbling of
the guns that filters down into the dug-out
and the threatening green swords of the
searchlights.
To Stanhope, the company commander,
falls the responsibility of controlling all
these diverse terrors. He _is a first-rate
officer, an inspiration to his men, always
ready to risk his life; the popular idea of
a valiant hero. But he is more horribly
afraid than any of them because lie is cursed
with the most sensitive imagination. He
knows exactly what his splendid body will
look like riddled with m.g. bullets.
Fear, noble and ignoble, being the theme,
the story is itself almost irrelevant, Stan-
hope, Raleigh’s school hero, is engaged to
Raleigh’s sister. By a series of coincidences
Raleigh is drafted to Stanhope’s company.
He finds Stanhope after three years of it
in a condition of nerves where the, only way
of relieving the enormous tension of exis-
tence is repeated bouts of drunkenness. Po
Stanhope the romantic young cub is simply
the ghost of himself before the war destroyed
him. He fears that Raleigh will write home
and tell the truth about him, so he exercises
his right of censorship and opens his first
letter. There is a dramatic scene when it
turns out that the boy has been clear-sighted
enough to see the essential fineness of Stan-
hope. Raleigh wins the M.G. and Osborne
is killed in a daylight raid designed by IRQ.
in the most idiotic fashion available. _ lhe
German attack starts and Raleigh’s spine is
broken in the preliminary bombardment. He
is carried into the dug-out to die, and the
fiual curtain descends on the full uproar ot
the battle.
“Journey’s End” is a calm, assured piece of
playwriting that carries conviction without
resort to time-honored devices for scoring
a theatrical sensation. It is so good that
there is nothing seen on the Australian boards
for a long time with which one could com-
pare it. It richly deserves the acting it is
getting. As Stan-
hope, Reginald
Tate dominates the
piece with a quiet
realism, punctuated
by emotional out-
bursts that are
deeply impressive.
As Raleigh, Lewis
Shaw, with the
ingenue manner
which seems native
to him, captures
the affections as he
did in “Young
Woodley.” As the
stout, amiable sen-
sualist Trotter,
Vincent Lawson is
ex c e 11. en t, and
Osborne, the
sequestered school-
master stuffed by
Fate, the inexor-
able tailor, into an
officer's uniform, is
sedately done by
Harvey Adam s.
The culinary hu-
mors necessary to
keep an audience
in laughs and
complete the pic-
ture are provided
by John Fernside,
whose farce, how-
ever, is less the
farce of a real
character than of
a stage jester. Am-
brose Flower, Alan
Lawrance and Regi-
nald Wykeham fit
unobtrusively into

Sydney’s bright-
est stage offering—
and a bit over —at
the moment is the
rainbow musicomedy, “The Five-o clock Girl,
which on Saturday returned Alfred Frith to his
old stamping ground, Her Majesty’s. It is
a very airy-fairy thing* without half the body
of “The Desert Song,” which was still filling
the house, an “obstinate success,” when it
was dragged oil the night before. The l lye-
o’clock” music, also, does not compare with
the ditties that ran through the Sheiky show,
nor with the rollicking songs of The \ aga-
bornl King” ; but the piece, nevertheless, is a
joyous, bright thing, done in the Firm’s very
best manner.
For humor of all sorts it beats its mmc.
diate forerunners to a frazzle. «us
and Cecil Kellaway start it with patter in
an accent that smacks of somewhere arounc
Yorkshire, and Frith —the old Frith with a
new polish in looks and stagecraft con-
tinues it in large numbers. Fj-ith s offsidci
in long bouts of conspicuously clean tun-
making is the three-foot-odd ot femininity
called Tui P»lack. She not only supports him
admirably—she is a rare slice of amusement
in herself. Among them these four make
the.long first half of the show almost a
shout of laughter from end to end. There
is plenty of fun in the other half, too, but
the humor does not predominate, and the
musicomedy heroine and hero, Helen Patter-
son and William
Valentine, come
more into their
own. The Patter-
son is a neat and
unusually _ shaded
blonde, with a
sweet though _ un-
inspiring voice.
Valentine is the
singer of the two.
Excellent special-
ty dancing by the
Kendalls, a bright
ballet and good
producing finish off
a ' rattling good
entertainment, in
which Frith’s ' per-
formance alone is
a full evening’s
amusement.

Clemence Dane’s
“Granite,” intro-
duced at the Tur-
ret, North Sydney,
on Saturday, opens
in a living-room of
a house on Lundy,
a storm-swept isle
off Devon, on a
tempestuous night
over a century ago.
Resident there are
Jordan Morris;
Judith, his wife,
handsome but em-
bittered ; Prosper,
his half-brother, a
genial seaman
home from the
wars; and Penny
Holt, a pretty
maid-servant. Out-
wardly a farmer,
Jordan’s real busi-
ness is smuggling
and salvaging
planned wrecks.
His severity and nefarious ways have
soured Judith, who wants the younger,
more human Prosper, and prays to the Devil
to help her. An unexpected ally stumbles
across the threshold in the shape of a sup-
posedly shipwrecked mariner, and Judith,
in return for saving his life, obtains an
assurance that he will help her. He re-
deems his promise with alacrity. Jordan,
angered by Judith’s perversity over a trifling
domestic matter, manhandles her, then
stamps out of the house. The stranger
follows and kills him, unknown to anyone
except Judith. Free of Jordan, Judith mar-
ries Prosper, but her second matrimonial
venture is also unhappy, for Prosper decides
to remain on Lundy and quarry the granite
on the isle instead of taking his bride to
England as promised. Also, the stranger
(an escaped convict) is attracted too much
to her. Prosper, resenting the intimacy
between the two, wants to dismiss him, but,
though he refuses Judith’s plea, made at
the ex-convict’s instigation, keeps the man
there when the maid, Penny, makes a similar
plea. Madly jealous, Judith attacks Penny,
and in trying to restore peace Pros-
per bruises his wife’s wrists and leaves the
house in anger. The ex-convict also leaves
and hurls Prosper over the cliff. He then
re-enters, and claims Judith and the farm,
his objectives from the start.
In a* gloomy, depressing drama, which
descends at times into undiluted melodrama,
there was a strong tendency to over-act.
Molly Ivirwan (Judith), despite her patent
sincerity, gave way to a too-strident theatri-
calism; John Gould, as Jordon, and Richard
Parry, as Prosper, were well cast; the rest
ranged from fairish to only-just.

A revival of “The Patsy” at Sydney Cri-
terion on Saturday is most worthy of note
for the first-class work of the youthful Aus-
tralian, Elma Gibbs, in the title role. Irene
Homer made the part originally, and made it
well, but Miss Gibbs scores one telling point
by having none of the American girl’s predi-
lection for addressing her lines as secrets to
the footlights. She has a good, clear voice,
an engaging appearance and a keen feeling
for the sort of comedy that runs close to
being plaintive. A touching little show, “The
Patsy.” Anyway, it has touched the pocket
of Australia.

Listeners-iii had their first “classical”
concert under the Australian Broadcasting
Co regime sent out from Sydney Town Hall
on Saturday night. Arundel Orchard con-
ducted the Conservatorium Orchestra, open-
ing with the “William Tell" overture and
passing with almost sacrilegious speed to
Schubert’s “Unfinished. Symphony.’ Beetho-
ven’s Concerto, No. 3, in C minor, had \\ ll-
Jiam Murdoch at the piano as principal in-
terpreter, and Spencer Thomas contributed
some satisfying song. The “Phaeton sym-
phonic poem, Saint-Saens, went too slowly,
but Bocherini’s “Minuet for Strings was
compensation enough. Two movements of
• ‘The Planets” (llolsti completed the teast.

week filled her hearers with a dim religious
emotion as if they were present at a church
service, and the lady's habit of standing like
a sublimated chorister heightened the impres-
sion. Giannini has the ability to sing, one
moment, like an inspired yogi loose amongst
the roses after a long period of austerities,

Adelaide Royal ran the locally-made
“Juanita” for more than the at first
proposed, and to packed houses. The book
by Edith Aird, a clever presswoman, and
the songs by Fewster and King, set out a
pleasant story of a Spanish girl who
returned from school in England disinclined
to marry a local nobleman. Vendetta
declared, abduction following, with rescue
by the English visitors. The music is haunt-
ing if reminiscent, and the whole play well
deserves a professional trial.
The principals, all amateur, sang well, but
lacked the dash needed for complete success
in this kind of thing. Thelma Baulderstone
acts finely as a jealous Spanish girl, and the
author put in much resolute and telling low
comedy as a Cockney maid who gets abducted
in error. The chorus and the dancing are
the backbone of the show. Mr. and Mrs.
Sliolto Bowman looked after this side of it,
and scored heavily. Audiences Avere enthusi-
astic, and charities will benefit largely. Ray
Walsh was the producer.

Brisbane Majesty’s now has “The Desert
Song,” which, contrary to the usual custom
with shows sent on tour, is played by its
original cast in full strength. Nellie Bram-
ley, at the Royal, is also breaking new
ground—her current offering, “My Girl
Lory,” has never been done in Australia
before. It is a four-act comedy built around
the anxiety of a young author’s mother to
see that her son has an “affair.” It happens
all right, and then the family objects, And
so on, to the happy end. McAllister, late
of the Brantley company, has started on
his own account at the Bohemia, with a
variety show.

A FALSE IMPRESSION

It is a false impression among many stockowners that minerals,

hand-fed—particularly concentrated fodder, maize, etc.
It is most essential to use a mineralised Salt Lick to supply
the all-important minerals, and aid digestion and the assimi-

and Maoriland—has been remarkable expan-
sion during the last decade. Prior to that
liquidation was an important part of the
programme, and general-manager Heron and
his assistants were busy repairing the cracks
that the upheaval of the ’nineties had left
in the business. Meanwhile writing down
and other forms of internal reserve had
received such careful attention that when
everything was ready for profit-dividing
again, the reserves were much greater than
met the eye. Also the vigorous management
had mapped a progressive policy of develop-
ment, which, aided by a run of good average
seasons, made the call for more capital loud
and persistent.
Half-way through the last term both
classes of shareholders were offered another
500,000 10s. ords., one for seven, at the
usual 100 p.c. premium. That raised paid
capital to £3,803.600 at .Tune 30; there was
then another £127,500, of which £63,750 was
share premiums, to come in. In all share-
holders have been asked for no less than
£3,308,682 since 1920, one-half capital and
the other half premiums. The latter was
of course added to reserves. These having
had the help of £323,592 of surplus
earnings now amount visibly to £1,994.191.
The premiums mean that the recent flood of
new capital is costing the bank only 71 p.c.;
and of course the 15 p.c. dividend isn’t really
anything of the sort on the bulk of the ordi-
nary capital. Nevertheless, since the
market’s opinion of the scrip is a high one,
the new issues have been in the nature of
handsome bonuses to shareholders.
The £2,117,350 of cheap pref. money—it
represents part of the old bank’s debt to
depositors—is another factor. Its importance
is illustrated by the figures showing the rela-
tion of net profits to total capital employed.
The ratio was 10.8 p.c. last year; but after
handing the prefs. their £84,694, the balance
of the year’s net earnings was no less than
20.6 p.c. on average ordinary capital. Actu-
ally, though, on the funds at work, the bank is
reaping very moderate harvests. The £391,624
claimed by the accounts was only 7.1 p.c.
on average funds (capital and reserves com-
bined) as against 7.9 in 1927 and 9.7 p.c.
back in 1924. The decline is, however, not
surprising considering the heavy inflow of
capital. To pay last year’s divs. those funds
had to net only 5.6 p.c.; so the margin for
lay-by was still very comfortable.
What it has cost to handle the steadily-
mounting income is seen in this next com-
parison :

*Less taxes and provision for contingencies.
After making provision for contingencies the
spring in the year’s gross profit was £81,784
compared with a spring of £63,793 in the
previous year; and since exes, took only
£45.,L79 of the increase, the net result bene-
fited by £36,605 as against an improvement
of £13,308 in the 1928 figure. Last year
exes, took 65.5 p.c.' of the gross profits, com-
pared with 65.3 p.c. in 1923. Considering
the bank now has over 130 more branches
than it had six years ago, a pretty tight hold
must have been kept upon outgo.
The leap in last year’s earnings is not
surprising in view of the increase of
£3,929,675 in the book value of advances,
and a decrease of £1,603,02S in liquids.
These and other things are seen in the
following comparison of balance-sheet
figures:—

What probably pleases the board more than
anything else there is the growth of
£1.744,405 in fixed deposits. The borrower
will come; it is the lender who has to be
pursued. The steady increase in the note
issue reflects the co.’s expanding connections
in Maoriland.. The strong demand for accom-
modation sent advances to 92 p.c. of deposits
as against 82.2 p.c. at the previous balance,
and liquids fell back to 34 p.c. of the debt
to the public compared with 43.4 p.c. at the
close of accounts in 1928. The position in
this respect, however, should be strengthened
as the balance of the cash on the last new
issue comes in. At June 30 the bank was
holding only £4 3s. Bd. of the public’s money
for every £1 of its own funds, and that is
a strong position.
On the market the 10s. ords. are firm
around 30s. 3d., and have been for a long
time. The immediate return at that figure
is a whisper under 5 p.c. on a 15 p.c. div.
basis. The visible backing amounts to 21s.
9d. per share in net tangibles. For the £lO
prefs. £7 Bs. is paid ; they participate in new
share issues, have priority as to capital, but
are entitled only to 4 p.c. cumulative to 3
p.c. At £7 Bs. the return is 5.4 p.c. on a
4 p.c. div. basis. The net tangible cover
figures out at approximately £2B per share.

* Includes arrears.
The last couple of years have seen changes
which have greatly improved this co.’s out-
look. One of its big problems has been to find
a market for linseed oil commensurate with
the market for linseed meal. It came about
in this way. Oil and cake are produced
by one process from one raw material, and
oil represents about one out of every three
tons of seed crushed. Owing to the manage-
ment’s energy in demonstrating the value of
cake and nuts as stock food, the demand for
meal quickly outstripped the demand for oil.
Thus, while overhead grew as production
increased, revenue did not get the full benefit
of the expanding output. The local develop-
ment of the lino, industry, in which linseed
oil is one of the chief raw materials, offered
a way out, but early attempts in that direc-
ting were not successful. So chairman
Philips went to Britain and induced Michael
Nairn and Cos., the big lino, people of Kir-
caldy, Scotland, to take over the Linoleum
Manufacturing Cos. of Australia, Ltd., in
which Meggitts were interested. That was in
1027. The result was the formation of
Michael Nairn and Cos. (Australia.), Ltd.,
which now has a paid capital of £250,000 —
£BO,OOO of it, in scrip, represents the price
paid for the old business, which the vendors
had bought from the bank.
A further important development occurred
last year, when Meggitts entered into “per-
manent and satisfactory arrangements” to
manufacture linseed oil here and market it
under the trade-marks of Blundell, Spence
and Cos., of Loudon and Hull. This will, of
course, further simplify the problem of main-
taining a balance between oil and meal,
besides tending to stabilise the oil market.
Though figures for the 12 months to May
31 have not had a chance to get any bene-
fit worth mentioning from the alliances
recently made, gross profits (£81,836) im-
proved £1450. Exes. (£50.451) were only
£92 heavier; thus the net result was £1358
better than the previous year’s. After hand-
ing the prefs. their 10 p.c. (£4000) the
balance of the net earnings was 8.3 p.c. on
the ordinary capital compared with 8 p.c. in
each of the two preceding years. The div.
was kept at 7f p.c., and the £2833 that
remained advanced the lay-by to £20,362.
Goodwill, which the “Wild Cat” has not
treated as an asset in its tables, figures at
£115,747. Over the last nine years the ords.
have had an average of a whisper under 4
p.c., but the 1920 reconstruction makes that
worth a lot more to old holders.
• This comparison of balance-sheet figures
reflects the year’s brisker trading:—

Cash, etc. .. 17,251 3,132 24,643 41,342
The outstanding features of the latest
accounts are an increase of £74,499 in drafts
for linseed shipments (£106,341) and a
growth of only £46,783 in the book value of
stock. Since the expansion in the liability
was £27,716 greater than that in the asset
acquired, it looks as though stocks were
realised more rapidly than the bills fell due.
On the other hand it might mean that stocks
have been taken in at a lower valuation than
usual. Or there may bo some of both. Other
encouraging features are a growth of £18,702
in book debts and the strengthening of the
cash holding (£23,612) by £lß,Oll. Shares
m other cos. (£17,730) were up £BO.
Excluding these, but including stocks, the
more or less liquid surplus (£109,664) was
£2619 stronger than at the close of accounts
in 1928. Plant (£80,638, up £390 during the
year) i s reported to be highly efficient and
adequately depreciated, and much depends
upon that.
Michael Nairn and Cos. have commenced
manufacturing, and two months ago were
turning out enough plain lino, to meet Aus-
tralian requirements. Meggitt’s production
costs should, therefore, now ease; and, pro-
vided nothing unforeseen occurs, a better
result should be shown at the next balance.
Of course profits will remain sensitive to fluc-
tuations in the co.’s raw seed markets —
“tefly S. America and India. The 1922 and
1.)2b figures, by the way, are sharp
reminders of what can happen in this connec-
tion.
The market, which paid 14s. 9d. for the
ords. a year ago, now prices them at 19s: 3d.
After allowing for the final div. the return at
the _ latter figure is 8.1 p.c. on a p.c. div.
basis The net tangible backing amounts to
14s. 2d. per fully paid ordinary share. Both
lots of prefs. are priced at 265. 6d.; the
figure, is 7.6 p.c. There are
2U,O(M) firsts and a like number of seconds;
each lot carries a cumulative 10 p.c has
priority as to capital, and rank in the order
stated. For the firsts the cover is £ls 13s
Bd. and for the seconds £l4 13s Bd. in net
tangibles.

Drought and financial stringency in Queens-
land caused doubt as to the future of values,
which made it difficult for the co. to realise
many of its trust investments. Mainly
because of this returns have not kept pace
with the growth in the volume of trust
business, which has been stepping along
nicely, as this next comparison shows:—
1910 *.. £2,135,244 1925 .. £6,596,698

At .Tune 30 trust funds were placed
£2.381,528 in Government securities;
£2,231,334, shares in public cos.; £1,413,098,
real estate; £743,702, mortgages; £689,455,
pastoral properties; £1,327,946 sundry in-
vestments. The hook value of estates that
passed into the co.’s care last year exceeded
those wound up by £828,268, and only once
has a bigger leap been recorded. That was
in 1899. when the Tyson estate was put
on the books.
The improvement in last year’s commission
earnings and rents (£39,661) was only
£735; in the previous year there was a
shrinkage of £495, and a growth of only
£766 in the year before that. A little over
two years ago substantial additions were
made to the premises, and the staff increased.
This and louder calls from the tax-gatherer
helped exes, along; they took £31,165. or
78.5 p.c. of last year’s gross earnings, com-
pared with 78.2, 79.9 and 74.5 p.c. in the
three preceding terms.
In order to wipe out the overdraft
(£20,000) in connection with the new build-
ing, ss. per share (£25,250) was called in
shortly before the close of accounts in 1927.
Then the board, satisfied that the future was
right, capitalised £12,625 (2s. 6d. per share)
of reserves, reducing the visible accumulation
to a mere £284. All this added £37,875 to
capital, making it £88,375 in 101,000 shares
of £2 each, paid to 17s. 6d., of which 7s. Gd.
represents gifts handed out since 1917.
From one cause and another net earnings
fell away to 9.6 p.c. on average funds (capi-
tal and reserves combined) last year. That
was after setting aside £6OO for taxation as
against £IOOO in the previous year, when
10.6 was netted on average funds, and that
was preceded by 12.7, 16.6 and 16.3 p.c. back
to 1925. A year ago a couple of points were
chipped off the div., reducing it to 8 p.c.;
but that is equal to 14 p.c. on the 10s. per
share of cash-paid capital, or 9.3 p.c. on
the share register total as it stood imme-
diately before the last gift.
Excluding an overdraft of £37,329 for
secured advances to trust estates, etc., the
co.’s own funds and a trifle of debt were
placed in this way:—
1915. 1925. 1928. 1929.

Book debts and
cash .. .. 3,727 1,806 11,327 10,749
Of the total assets 67 p.c. is in city office
property, and 21.8 p.c. in Government securi-
ties ; the respective proportions were 54 p.c.
and 39 p.c. in 1915.
Notwithstanding anxiety concerning Brit-
ish preferences for Queensland’3 surplus
sugar output, the outlook in the northern
State is more satisfactory than it has been
for some time. And the share market, which
expects something better than 8 p.c. pre-
sently, offers 255. 9d. for the scrip without
attracting sellers. The immediate return at
that price is 5.2 p.c. on an 8 p.c. div. basis.
The backing amounts to 18s. per share in
net tangibles.

The Sydney co. was such a success that this
wholesale ice-cream vendor spread to Queens-
land a couple of years ago; and the quick
success of the Queensland venture sent Mel-
bourne and Perth rushing for the shares when
Vic. and W.A. cos. were lately put on the
market. For 200,000 £1 shares in the Vic.
co. no less than £2,290,000 was offered.
The business was started by F. A. B.
Peters 22 years ago with a capital of £2OOO.
By 1920 the figure had grown to £50,000.
Then, following a visit of the chairman to
America, there was a reconstruction. Good-
will was valued at £25,250—it still stands
at that three new £1 shares
paid to 15s. were handed out in the present
co. for every £1 held in the old co. Imme-
diately the management set to work to liven
turnover. First a cake cone was introduced.
Its success led to the development of a big
trade in packed lines; the co. now buys
“Kleen Kups” in quantities up to 10,000,000
at one time. About three years ago sales got
a further lift when the co. provided refrigera-
ting cabinets, thus assisting retailers to
reduce their risks and enabling it to build
up a country trade. In addition up-to-date
plant has kept production costs down. That
and other things have enabled the board
to show some glittering results.
The growth in last year’s declared net
profit (£73,132) was £0834, the total reach-
ing 19 p.c. on average capital compared
with 18, 19.7, 19.1 and 17.9 p.c. back to
1924, so the 13J p.c. div. was repeated with
comfort. With more comfort probably than
those ratios suggest. The year’s unexplained
additions to the general, taxation and depre-
ciation reserves—the lot are lumped in
one untidy entry at £36B,6lß—was £86.018,
of which £30,000 was presumably on account
of scrip received for the sale of the co.'s
Victorian rights. So contributions out of
ordinary revenue were apparently £56,018,
or £12,440 more than in the previous year,
when £20,000 in scrip was received for the
sale of the Queensland rights. After allowing

OBJECTS OF THE AUSTRALIAN WHALING
COMPANY, LIMITED.
The objects of the Company, which are set out in full
detail in the Memorandum of Association, are to engage (in
co-operation with existing Companies or otherwise) in the
business of whaling, and in Other matters incidental to the
industry, including :
(1) Pelagic (open sea) Whaling in Antarctic and Southern
Waters.
(2) ACQUISITION AND OPERATION OP THE NOR-
WEGIAN BAY (Point Cloates) Shore Whaling
Station on the NORTH-WEST COAST OF
AUSTRALIA.
(3) Construction and operation of a shore station on the
SOUTH COAST OF NEW SOUTH WALES.
In pursuance thereof to enter into an agreement with the
vendors to acquire the Assets and Plant mentioned in object
No. 2, and the results of their past investigations; then-
right, title and interest in an agreement made with Mr.
David G. Stead; and their rights and services in connection
with the acquisition of certain lands on the South Coast of
New South Wales.
An examination of .accompanying data will show very clearly:
(1) The GREAT ATTRACTIVENESS of the whaling
industry from an INVESTOR’S STANDPOINT.
(2) That the industry is paying IMMENSE DIVIDENDS to
Companies 14,000 miles away from the scene of
operations; and
(3) That Australia, from all points of view, is exceedingly
well situated as the headquarters of a whaling
company.
FINANCIAL PROPOSALS OF THE
COMPANY.
The Company proposes to acquire immediately five Whaling
Gunboats or Chasers and commence operations as early as
possible at the Norwegian Bay Whaling Station, on the North-
west Coast of Australia, WHICH HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL!. {
OPERATED FOR SEVERAL YEARS PAST.
Simultaneously the necessary steps will be taken to secure
a suitable vessel, k)f about 12,000 to 14,000 tons oil capacity
(which is the average size of the largest boats engaged, and
would provide for a capacity of up to 80,000 barrels of oil),
for conversion into a Whaling Factory ship. This will be
fully equipped in the most modern manner as a “Mother Ship, ’
and utilised with chasers for "whaling in the Antarctic and
Southern Seas at the close of the season in Australian Coastal
Waters.
Immediately upon the construction and establishment of
the Shore Station on the South Coast of New South Wales,
the fleet of chasers will be suitably increased to meet the
extended operations.
UTILISATION OF CAPITAL SUBSCRIBED.
After careful consideration the estimated cost of the purchase
and fitting out of a suitable fleet of vessels and of other capital
outlay has been assessed as follows: —

Subsequently a site on the Eastern Coast of New South
Wales will be equipped as a fitting-out and laying-up station
and as a complete Share Whaling Station handling all products,
including oil, fertilisers, skins, whalebone, spermacetti, meat-
meal, etc.
ESTIMATED PROFITS
I.—NORWEGIAN BAY, WESTERN
AUSTRALIA.
After careful calculation, following upon a survey
of all available data in connection with the costs of
working the Norwegian Bay Whaling Station, the
following profits are estimated therefrom: —
Revenue: —
Based upon the actual catches for
several years past and allowing for
seasonal variations, it is estimated
that five gunboats' or chasers,
during the season from June to
October, would catch at least 1100
whales, yielding approximately
6417 tons of oil. Valued at
present market price, this amounts
to £198,927 0 0
(In 1928 four chasers caught 1036 whales.l
It may, therefore, be assumed that
with by-products a gross Revenue
may be estimated of at least .. £200,000 0 0
Deduct therefrom Running Expenses:—
Wages, Lay (or Bonus) for Shore
Station and Chasers, Stores and
Providoring, Fuel, Repairs and
Maintenance of Vessels and
Station, Depreciation, etc., Trans-
port, Loading and Discharge of
Oil and Guano, Office and
General Overhead ~v .. .. 93,000 0 0
Leaving an Estimated Profit (subject
to Income Taxes) of . . . . £107,000 0 0
2. —ANTARCTIC AND SOUTHERN
SEAS.
Based on the actual catches of
whales during the past few years
by Norwegian vessels, which, each
year, have returned with full
cargoes within the season from
Antarctic Waters, it is estimated
, that the value of one cargo only
of at least 70,000 barrels of oil at
present market price of £3l per
ton would yield approximately.. £360,000 0 0
Deduct therefrom :—■
Estimated Running Costs and Work-
ing Expenses, including Wages,
Lay (or Bonus'), Providoring,
Coal, Fuel, Oil Stores, Repairs
and Renewals, Depreciation of
Ships, Insurance of Ships and
Cargo, General Overhead, etc. .. 175,800 0 0
Leaving an Estimated Profit (subject
to Income Taxes) from one cargo
only from Southern Waters of .. £184,200 0 0
The Estimated Profit, therefore, from whaling in
these two areas amounts to £291,200 (subject to
Income Taxes).
These statements do not include any estimated
additional Profit from Whaling on the Eastern Coast
of Australia. Upon the construction of the Eastern
Shore Station the number of Chasers will be adequately
increased and utilised there during the months of June
to October, while the remaining Chasers operate at
Norwegian Bay Shore Station, Western Australia.
A conservative estimate, based on actual trials off
the Eastern Coast, shows that a further Profit to the
extent of approximately £BO,OOO should result in oil
alone from operations on the South Coast of New South
Wales.
GENERAL MANAGEMENT.
All matters of vital importance, such as the purchasing,
out fittings of the ships, etc., will receive the utmost considera-
tion, and will only be placed in the control of those who, by
their experience, are the most capable of handling them.
Regarding general labor to be employed, the Company
would at the outset follow closely upon the lines of other
ventures in these respects, employing experienced Norwegians
in the key positions, where long experience is requisite, thus
proceeding upon definitely proved lines.
The following tabulation gives the results of the operations
of four whaling Companies taken from the official figures of the
Norwegian Stock Exchange:-
Name of Company.
Compania Ballenera Espanola
Whaling Co., “Sydhavet”
Whaling Co., “Toensberg Hvs
Whaling Co., “Vestfold”
This shows an average rate of dividend , over the lour years
of approximately 45 per cent, per annum, which in itself should
be sufficiently convincing evidence of the remunerative nature
of the business. These profits take no account ot capital
by bonus shares.
VENDOR’S CONSIDERATION.
The Vendor Company will sell and transfer to the Australian
Whaling Company, Limited, plant, fittings and equipment of
the Norwegian Bay Whaling Station, situated near Point Cloates
on the North-west Coast of Australia, as per certified schedules
valued as a going concern at £110,150, together with an
exclusive Whaling license and lease for a period of fourteen
years from January 1, 1930, and expend a sum up to £9OOO
in cash towards the flotation and preliminary expenses ot the
Australian Whaling Company, Limited. They will also transfer
the results of investigations for over twelve months and the
rights in connection with the acquisition of certain land on
the South Coast of New South Wales.
The consideration of these assets, etc., is the payment to
the vendors of £50,000 in cash, payable over an extended
period, and on the terms and conditions set forth in the
agreement, and the issue of 70,000 shares of £1 issued as
fully paid up. Certain restrictions have been placed on these
shares as a protection to the capital publicly subscribed in
the Australian Whaling Company, Limited.
COMMENCEMENT OF OPERATIONS.
Much of the preliminary work has been done by those
connected with the Company, with a view to commencing
Australian operations at the Norwegian Bay Station, Nortli-
“West Australia, next season, thence working southward into
alluuuo umw’s at Liie "clid of the Australian season, _ and
in the following year undertaking operations in the vicinity
of Jervis Bay, New South Wales.
MINIMUM SUBSCRIPTION AND ALLOTMENT.
It is the opinion of those connected with the Company
that operations at Norwegian Bay should not be undertaken
until at least £7.3,000 is subscribed, and the Directors, therefore,
WILL NOT PROCEED TO ALLOTMENT UNTIL 75,000
SHARES HAVE BEEN APPLIED FOR.
In the event of the Company proceeding to allotment on
75,000 shares only £30,000 of the Vendors’ consideration
will be paid over a period of not less than eighteen months,
thereafter the balance will be paid, having due regard to the
receipts of capital, so that the operations of the Company
are not unduly impaired by the alienation of working capital.

for the final div. and deducting goodwill, the
total lay-by (£365,363) was equal to 90.8
p.c. of the book value of the plant at June
30. Exactly how much of it is required
to cover loss of capital through wear and
tear of plant, etc., could with advantage
be stated definitely.
The rapid expansion of the business over
the last five years is reflected in this com-
parison of balance-sheet figures :

Since 1926 £249,858 has been added to the
book value of plant, and £95,006 to free-
holds, etc. To do it £158,528 of fresh capital
was got in and only £6166 added to the debt.
The balance was provided out of earnings.
Finances are comfortable; at June 80 liabili-
ties were covered nearly 24 times by more
or less liquids totalling £49,986, including
stocks (£11,366).
To finance further additions to plant and
provide for general expansion of business,
shareholders were offered 170,454 new £1
shares, one for three, early last month. Only
ss. is wanted at present. When the issue is
paid to 155., bringing it into line with the
old scrip, paid capital will la* £51.1,363 in
681,818 £1 shares. A 1.3/, p.c. div. will then
call for £4950 less than last year’s declared
net earnings. Other developments since the
close of accounts have been the sale of the
co.’s Westralian rights for £25,000 in scrip
to Peters’ American Delicacy Cos. (W.A.),
Ltd., which has an issued capital of
£250,000. Also an extra 20,000 £1 shares
have been taken up at par in the Brisbane
co. f Peters-Arctic Delicacy Cos., Ltd., which
has paid two lots of 10 p.c. and recently
extended its interests to North Queensland,
where it lias formed an associate concern.
But to what • extent the past can be
accepted as a guide to tin* future it is im-
possible to say. The recent rapid growth of
the business has been aided by free spending
on luxuries. But the more prosperous the co.
becomes the greater tin* temptation for others
to enter the field. Already strenuous oppo-
sition is reported from Victoria; The share
market, however, sees no cloud in the co.'s
sky and pays 395. 6d. for the scrip. At that,
figure the return is only a whisper over 5
p.c. on a 131 p.c. div. basis. The backing
per pound of paid capital amounts to 395.
in net tangibles, mostly in fixed assets, worth
what they can earn.

With an eye to the future the hoard bought
an adjoining freehold for £23,428 about six
years ago. It was not long before building
additions were called for, and anew wing
was erected. It provides accommodation for
an extra 170 guests, making the total capa-
city about 500. The work was put in hand
a couple of years ago. To see the job
through 60,000 £1 shares were offered at: a
premium of ss. each, and the lot were quickly
snapped. That was in the June half of
1928 ; it made paid capital £210,000, of which
the last £l2O came in during the past term.
The premiums—they mean that the new
capital is costing the co. 8 p.c.—went to
reserves.
Though the new building was not completed
until after the close of accounts in 1928, it
was fully occupied by the end of Dec., not-
withstanding that the contractor was not
then off the premises. From these additions
and various other structural improvements,
the Metropole benefited substantially; and
after making whatever provision was con-
sidered necessary for depreciation, etc., the
board said that net profit was £5812 better
than the previous year’s. The result was
equal to 11.4 p.c. on average capital com-
pared with 11.3, 12.8, 12.1 and 12.4 p.c. back
to 1925. Free of interference from building-
operations, and with the extra space at work
for the full term, the current year’s results
might be expected to show further improve-
ment. It all looks very encouraging for a
steady 10 p.c. div. Certainly the general
outlook is not so bright as it might be;
circumstances have already compelled some
restriction in both public and private spend-
ing, and it seems almost certain that in
the future the public will have to dip deeper
into its pockets for its cash.
In the past the co. has been extraordinarily
successful. In 1905 it took over the old
property for about £40,000 less than it cost
the vendor, and began with a paid capital
of £92,507. Seven years later the mortgage
had been redeemed, the pref. capital
(£21,800) returned and £45.000 of _ gift
scrip and a special cash bonus of £37,500
handed out. Mr. W. P. Small, the man who
negotiated the purchase, laid the foundations
of the business, and was for many years
managing director, died during the year. In
1920 the co. was reconstructed, and £60,000
fell into shareholders’ pockets, half in bonus
scrip, the other hand in cash. And then the
book value of fixed assets (£138,307) was
only £23,307 more than it was 14 years
earlier.
Chief balance-sheet movements since 1920
have been in, connection with the new build-
ing :

A year ago the old property appeared at
£134,500, obviously a conservative figure. At
last balance fixed assets were lumped at
£316,244, up £75.005, making the increase
£177,937 since 1921. Over the same period
shareholders have put up £75,000, and only
£29,631 has been added to the debt, which
was £32,633 in excess of the more or less
liquids at June 30.
The market expresses its confidence m
those in control by paying 31s. for the pound
shares as against 295. 6d. a year ago. At.
the current price the return is a whisper
under 6 A p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis. I he
visible backing amounts to 275. 7d. per share
in net tangibles.
The Oil Search at Roma.
The swabbing of Roma Oil Corporations
No. 1 bore has produced results of both
scientific and economic importance. It has,
in the first place, evidently determined new
horizons for gas, much richer in the wet
hydrocarbons than the first supply tapped.
This first supply lay above 3690 ft. in No. 1
bore; but the upper zone has been packed
out and the new flow is apparently all
coming from below 3700 ft. The maximum
flow from the lower level was 1,270,000 c.f.,
and has consistently yielded 2.1 to 2.7 pints
of petrol per 1000 c.f.; whereas the upper
horizons yielded under 1 and down to 0.6
pint.
It may be that the lighter-gravity gas
above is a more volatile product of the
heavier zone below which has escaped
through tiny fissures, if there is an imper-
meable'zone between. This suggests that the
co. may be nearer to an actual pool than
formerly, either edgewise on the latest, gas
horizon or in a still deeper sand suitable for
the retention of oil, should such exist.
Apparently bedrock, either of metamorphic
or granite, lias not been touched in this
bore, and a good case could perhaps be
made out for testing it to its extreme limit
in the petroliferous series.
The yield of 2i pints of petrol should
be a commercial proposition, and compares
favorably with many foreign gas-fields.
Incidentally, the “Wild Cat.’’ is rather
puzzled by the small yield of light yellow
crude oil reported in the settling tanks.
Broken Hill town is in a more cheerful
mood than it has been for years; and if it
wasn’t for the 12J p.c. levy, which practi-
cally the whole working community has to
pay for the maintenance of the Newcastle
district coal strikers, everything in the
garden would be almost lovely. Yet there
is no talk of a protest—week after week
2s. 6d. in the £ of all the miners’ earnings
goes off to maintain the Northern strike. No
wonder that the “Wild Cat’s” coalfield con-
tributor, asked the other day to calculate
how long the men could hold out, replied:
“Under present conditions, indefinitely.”

The Anglo-Austral Investment Syndicate,
representing Sydney interests, will shortly
transform itself into a limited co. to develop
silver-lead deposits at Mt. Galena, about 27
miles south from Captain’s Flat (N.S.W.).
The lodes are said to have been traced for
1000 ft. from the bottom to the top of the
mountain, and to extend for over 500 ft. in
width. Samples taken from the caps assayed
5 to 46 p.c. lead, and from 12dwt. to Boz.
silver. Also large deposits of limestone
and iron, suitable for fluxes for the furnaces,
are said to exist on the property. It all
reads like the days of the Broken Hill boom,
though they weren’t generally content with
12dwt. to Boz. of silver.

South Aus. is wondering whether it at
last has a payable goldfield at Mount Bryan.
Rawlings and Butler pegged out a reef from
which 10 to 20 oz. specimens were taken.
The' Ulooloo field, in the same district, was
worked for years half a century back. But,
like most other S. Aus. shows to date, it
proved to be an affair of ounce pockets and
pennyweight reefs.

The tin showing in the winze at the Great
Northern, Herberton (Q.), compares with
the best that managing-director Newell has
seen in the old mine. Out of this shoot
170-odd tons of concentrates have been won.
The face produces 21 tons of concentrates to
the foot advanced, and it’s in both ends.

The recent tin find at Glenelg Hills
(W.A.) has not become less encouraging
through prospecting. A number of lode and
alluvial areas have been pegged, but more
work is necessary before it can be said that
something worth v. hile has been proved.

Golden Butterfly, Norseman (W.A.), is
offering £BISO 10 p.c. first-mortgage bonds,
redeemable at par within three years.
Holders may convert into scrip, fully paid,
until March 30, 1930. The money is wanted
to finance development and erect a treatment
plant. Issued capital is £IIO,OOO in 10s.
shares, and there is £73,563 at call on
117,700 of them. Recently the co. has had
a lot of domestic troubles. There were
changes in the control in Oct. last, and the
new hoard has filed a claim for £17,000-odd
against members of the old one, and others.
At present the case stands part heard. The
co. holds 96 acres adjoining the old Mararoa
on the south. Geologist Gibson recommends
extension of the north drive on the 270 ft.
level. Here James McLeod, lately manager
of the Mararoa, met ore worth 60s. to 655.
in Nov. last.

Years ago, when returns from the rich shoot
in the co.’s lvalgoorlie mine fell off, Ora
Banda was relied on to make up some of
the deficiency, and did so for a time. Lower-
grade ore and higher costs, however, ulti-
mately made profitable mining there impos-
sible. The board then turned its attention
to Canada, but from all accounts nothing
suitable was found; and a Mexican “golden
holding” from which great things were
expected was also abandoned. When the
last financial statement w r as issued the co.’s
finances were still comfortable.

The Lancefield, at Laverton (W.A.), is one
big mine which it is hoped to bring back
to life by the flotation process, and Randells,
near the Trans, line and about 40 miles
from Kalgoorlie, is another. Lancefield was
floated by Hoover and others in the West-
ralian boom days, and was trumpeted in
London as a big tiling. So it was, and still
is, but the prohibitive cost of treating refrac-
tory ore ruined the original co., which was
reconstructed several times. Its successors,
a party of leading Kalgoorlie mining men,
made money for a while; then a burdensome
arbitration award forced them to get out.
Randells is more refractory than Lancefield,
and those who have tackled it to date have
left off poorer than they began.

Shareholders in London last mouth
approved a scheme for dealing with the
Golden Horseshoe-Lake View position. It
is proposed that the Horseshoe holding in
Lake View shall be distributed in the pro-
portion of one for each preferred and one
for every three ords. held, both classes to
then receive share for share in anew co. to
be formed for the purpose of re-treating the
big tailings dump on the Horseshoe lease.
After payment of £40,000 for the plant the
new co. is expected to have about £70,000
left.

North Coolgardie Goldfield (W.A.) has
received a little notice again on ac-
count of good returns from the Golden Age
mine, Menzies. Several fair-sized bars of
bullion have been got lately, and the holders
are still getting good stuff. But it is an
untrustworthy district.
Westralian Mines Department reports
receipt of some rich silver-lead ore from far
out Pilbara. Despite its many widespread
deposits of gold, tin, copper, lead and some
likely-looking asbestos, Pilbara has not pro-
gressed. Inaccessibility and costly trans-
port are mainly responsible. Some hustle
in connection with asbestos digging is, how-
ever, tipped to occur on the Marble Bar sec-
tion of the field before long.

Malcolm Newman, of Alluvial Tin, recently
arrived in Malaya from London, where ho
put in a lot of good work gathering into
association the tin producers of the world.
Newman has greatly impressed London and
is now very widely regarded there as the
greatest living authority on tin dredging.
Special inducements were offered to interest
him in Nigeria. Acceptance would have
meant permanent residence in London. He
compromised by accepting seats on the
boards of Lower Perak, Talerng and Pattani

The Fifty-first Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders was held
at the Company’s Head Office, 1 1 7 Pitt Street, Sydney, on August 8.
moving the adoption of the Report and Balance Sheet for the
year ended June 30, 1929, the Chairman, Mr. C. C. Gale,
financial
said:—■ .
Just 12 months ago you were invited to take part in the cere-
mony of placing a tablet on the Foundation Stone of this building,
which was then under construction. The progress, in the meantime,
had sufficiently advanced to permit occupation by the Company
on March 2 last of the floors required for our occupation; other
portions became available for our tenants at later dates. The whole
of the building is now practically finished, and any vacant rooms
are ready for occupation by additional tenants. In the Directors
Report, now submitted for your consideration, you are
that about seventy per cent, of the floor space not required by the
Company had been leased to desirable tenants; the position has
since been improved and negotiations for leasing additional rooms
are now proceeding. The rents asked are most moderate, and the
service given is a further attraction; consequently those conditions
warrant the assumption that the whole building should shortly be
occupied and the Capital represented in the investment be fully ,
productive, and in addition our new office has afforded added
convenience to the public, while increased efficiency and economy
has been obtained in carrying on the Company’s business.
ACCOUNTS: Turning to the Balance Sheet, you will recognise
that the resolutions adopted at the last Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders have been given effect to, and the financial position
has been further strengthened by the issue of the additional shares
authorised. Allowing for the payment of the Dividend authorised
the Subscribed Capital added to the Reserves total £721,479, being
about twice die amount of the net premium income; a very
substantial security is consequently provided for Policyholders.
THE GROSS PREMIUM INCOME for the period under review
is larger than received last year, but in consequence of a limitation
in the amount held on risks accepted, the net premiums are lower
than appearing in the previous year s report.
TAXATION, RATES and Contributions to Fire Brigades are
again on a higher scale; they have amounted to £30,1 98, representing
85 per cent, of the net premium income, compared with £28,481
paid last year and £2 7,922 paid the year before. Provision has been
made in the accounts for our contribution to the Family Endowment
Act. The promise by the Honourable the Treasurer of a reduction
in taxation next year is gratifying; I hope it will be sufficient to
afford reasonable relief. The effect of severe taxation is the diversion
of large sums from Industries to the Government, and the crippling
of private enterprise in a country that is looking for expansion.
EXPENDITURE: The total for the twelve months has
amounted to £143,962, compared with £160,894 for the previous
year. A portion of the expenditure is beyond the control of the
Directors —for instance, contributions to the Fire Brigade Board and
Taxation are determined by legislation, while the salaries for quite
a large portion of the staff are arbitrarily fixed by the Court. In-
creased charges for stationery and general equipment had also to be
met, while the large Capital expenditure during the erection of this
new Head Office building temporarily reduced the interest earnings.
The Underwriting profit represents 5.3 per cent, of the net
premiums, compared with 4.4 per cent, last year, and is a smaller
margin than usually regarded as sufficient for most business under-
takings; it also affords evidence that the rates charged are not
excessive.
GENERAL CONDITIONS: Considering the unfavorable con-
ditions that have applied throughout the latter half of the financial
year, I think you will agree that the result of our operations admits
of congratulation; the prolonged dislocation of the Timber Trade,
the suspension of work on the Northern Coalfields, added to the
dryness of the Autumn and Winter almost throughout Australia, and
the fall in the market price of our principal products have combined
to restrict progress and reduce earnings. It is a long lane that has
no turning, and I hope when it is again my pleasure to address you
1 will be able to submit a more cheerful report, accompanied by a
favorable Balance Sheet and increased earnings. Australia’s greatest
need is increased production, besides refraining from borrowing
abroad.
THE STAFF: Before closing I feel called upon to refer to the
good work on the part of the Staff, especially in the removal from
Martin Place to this address; it was an excellent example of team
work; the duties were carried out after hours most cheerfully and
in a capable manner without any dislocation to the business. I would
be failing in my obligations if I did not offer this tribute to their
loyal service.
BRANCH DIRECTORS, STAFFS AND AGENTS: I also take
the opportunity to acknowledge our thanks to the Directors and the
staffs in other States, who continue to render valuable service, which
is greatly appreciated, and I desire to include our Agents, whose
care and ready assistance have helped to place your Company in its
highly satisfactory position.
This year being Western Australia’s Centenary, I also take the
opportunity to offer the Directors’ hearty congratulations on the
occasion of that important event, and, in doing so, desire to express
the hope that the prosperity enjoyed by that State will be continuous.
FINALLY, let me again appeal to the Shareholders to
co-operate in placing their business with the Mercantile Mutual, and
in that way add to the value of the interest they possess in their
own Company.
I have now pleasure in moving the adoption of the Report and
Balance Sheet.

A Message of Importance
TO USERS OF
FERTILISER
The manufacture and distribution of fertilisers, particularly Super-
phosphate, are of such paramount importance not only to the
primary producers but to the whole community, since National
prosperity is dependent on prolific and profitable production,
that any movement in the fertiliser industry is a matter of general
interest and great moment.
The fact that four leading manufacturers of fertilisers and agri-
cultural chemicals—Cuming Smith Chemical Works, Mount Lyell
Chemical Works, Wischer Chemical Works and Federal Fertilisers
—have merged into one company must therefore be regarded as
an outstanding event in the industrial and agricultural history
of Australia. As Commonwealth Fertilisers and Chemicals
Ltd., the new concern will be a power for immense good, and
its formation will be regarded with high favour by far-seeing
agriculturists.
The products of the new Company
will be marketed under the Sickle in
Diamond trade-mark (illustrated) a
combination of brands already well
and favourably known. In every re-
gard the Company’s products will be
maintained at the high standards of
quality for which they have been
appreciated in the past.
With its greatly increased resources,
with its vast aggrega-
tion of experience, the
new Company confi-
dently expects to bring
about improvements
and economies in
manufacture and
e
distribution that must tend towards even
better fertilisers at lower prices to the
consumer. It is towards this end that
all activities are being turned at the
present moment and a definite an-
nouncement of reduced fertiliser
prices can be expected in due course.
No changes in personnel are intended
sothat past customers of the four com-
ponent Companies can have every con-
fidence in the new Com-
pany and can anticipate
the same thorough care
and attention to the
fulfilment of their or-
ders that they have ex-
perienced in the past.

ALITIE'S
“Yimkin”: As one constantly handling
sheep, I would like to learn the opinions
of sheep-men concerning the sheep-dog. It
is my belief that he is steadily deteriorating.
My experience of late
has been with half a
dozen pups and the
same number of fail-
ures; and I begin to
think that if one hap-
pens on a good dog
these days it is by a
fluke. All these pups
I spoke of have been
sent to me with first-
class pedigrees and
bred on the latest
lines. Some of them,
I’ll admit, can be
taught—after a lot of
trouble —to drive a
few sheep through a
small opening, but in
a paddock with a big
mob they work too
wide, and they abso-
lutely refuse to work
in a race or yard. Tic
dog of 20 years back
would break itself in,
often on a few fowls,
and in those days there
were very few failures,
if the breeding was
there, and after being
broken in they were useful all-round dogs—
something we seldom see to-day. If those in
authority over sheep-dog trials insisted on all-
round work, instead of driving three or five
wethers through a small opening, we might
have a utility dog that would be. a benefit to
the man getting his living from sheep, and
also to the sheep.

a certain age, the grinders cease to be a
true guide, and calculating his years becomes
largely a matter of guesswork, but this
brother-bushman says the tail continues to be
a correct guide. Does any member of the
Council know lioVv it’s done?
* * * *
“Apricot Again !’’: Have just read in Melb.
Herald a cable from Stamboul about an
apricot-tree in Shrapnel Gully grown from
a jam stone. We have been thinking of start-
ing an apricot farm for some time and
would like to know if any Abo. could tell
us the best brand of jam to use, and how
many tins to the acre would be required.
* * -!* *
“Bil Can”: For brevity and comprehen-
siveness lend me your ear for this. I wanted
a cook on a road camp, wanted him badly, so
I inserted an ad. in the local paper. A dapper
cliap blew along with Matilda and said:
“You want, a cook?” “Yes —have you any
references?” He nodded, unrolled Matilda,
and out comes a junk of bark. On the sap
was written in charcoal: “Not very clean,
but damn quick. Mick Lynch, contractor.”
We knew Mick, so engaged the chap. Mick
was right, too —on the first count of the
reference at any rate.
* * * *
“Wallis James”: This is the yarn of the
old squatter whom we met at Perth as we
were coming home in 1919. “First of all,”
he said, “you must know that my home-
stead is 500 miles from the sea, and during
the summer months we are lucky to have
sufficient water to make tea. One dry spell
a station-hand returned from Perth after
satisfying a thirst which had been developed
for three years. He was despondent, and
one night adjourned to his hut, and an hour
later was found dead. To meet the require-
ments of law in dealing with such cases, I
had to empanel a jury. The men were
rounded up with difficulty, and I was coroner.
I addressed the jury, giving them all the
information obtainable, and finished up my
eloquent speech by stating that in my opinion
the case was plainly one of felo-de-se. After
hearing evidence the jury retired to consider
the verdict. I learned later what trans-
pired. One of the station-hands addressed
the others: ‘Look here, boys, we all know
that Old Bill cut his throat, but the Boss
says he fell in the sea. The old has
some reason for putting it that way, you can
bet your life, so we may as well humor
him.’ So the verdict returned was ‘Found
drowned.’ ”
“F.A.”: The lady who spills a bottle of
red wine over the bows of the ferry-boat
which she is christening probably has no
idea that she is carrying on one of the most
gruesome customs of our ancestors. When
the Norseman pushed 'his craft into the blue
waters he called for the favor of his gods
by sacrificing a human victim. The rules
made it necessary for the keel to be stained
with gore, and to this end the victim was
made fast to the rollers and simply crushed
to pulp as the vessel weut down the fairway.
The custom was not confined to the Scan-
dinavians, for in recent times similar cere-
monies have been recorded as having taken
place in parts of New Guinea and other
islands of the Pacific. In those cases, how-
ever, it was nearly always a maiden who
was sacrificed.
* * * *
“Dolly Pot”: “F.0.M.” (B. 22/5/’29)
says too much when he alleges that a cat
can’t pant. At the old Mt. David goldmine
a white cat came and made a cosy home in
the boiler-house of the New shaft. Later on
a batch of kittens arrived and Puss was
soon roaming the bush for game, which she
carried to her little home behind the boilers
—birds, lizards, small rabbits and bush
rats were all duly landed. One hot day I saw
Maria pounce on a full-grown rabbit. A
ding-dong battle followed and continued
until Bunny was well and truly dead. With-
out stopping she dragged the bunny up the
steep hill to the door of the engine house.
There she stretched full length, her tongue
lolled out, and she panted like a dog well
spent. The rest of the staff agreed that it
was the only time they had seen a cat do it.
# * * *
“Frigid”: In Innisfail (N.Q.) there were
15 nationalities in a road gang, and they
drove successive foremen frantic trying to
make them understand. Several gave it up
in disgust. Then a deaf-and-dumb man
was given the supervising job and the cos-
mopolitan crew made astounding progess.
The chap who couldn’t speak was marvel-
lously eloquent with his hands.
* * * *
“Chetwynd”: There are some queer ferries
on the Murray, ranging from a sheet of
bark to a well-built boat, propelled by
paddle-wheels worked by feet and hands.
One old fellow who calls himself an engi-
neer. and is certainly very handy at repairing
almost any utensil, travels on eight kero-
sene-tins soldered water-tight, four forward
and four aft, joined together with battens.
He pokes about the river from station to
station on this contraption, and carries not
only a good swag and a collection of tools
but a fine collie.

HARD TACK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I'm a shearer, yes I am,
And I’ve shore ’em, sheep and lamb
From the Wimmera to Cooper’s Creek and
back;
And I’ve rung a shed or two
Where the fleece was tough as glue,
But I’ll tell you where 1 struck the
hardest tack.
I was down the Murray way,
Killin’ time from day to day
Till they started in the big sheds further
out,
When 1 met a bloke by chance,
That I summed up at a glance
As a cocky from a vineyard round about.
It seems he picked me, too —
Which it wasn’t- ’ard to do,
For a pair of tongs was ’anging at me
hip.
“I’ve got a mob,” he said,
‘‘Just about two ’undred ’ead,
And I'd give a fi’-pun note to ’ave the
clip.”
I said I’d take the stand.
(It meant gettin’ in me ’and)
And by nine o’clock he’d mustered up the
mob
In a shed sunk in the ground
With wine vats all around,
And this was where I started on the
job.
I went easy for a bit
While me ’and was gettin’ fit,
But by dinner-time I’d done some half
a score,
With the cocky pickin’ up
And passin’ me a cup
Full of pinkie after 'every sheep I shore.
’Twas about the seventh day,
I think, he went away
After fellin’ me the sort of cask to use.
Then I'd do the pickin’-up
And manipulate the cup,
Strollin’ round among the vats to pick and
choose.
Then I’d come back to the pen,
Grab a sheep and start again,
With a noise between a hiccup and a
sob,
And at times I’d fall asleep
With me arms around the sheep,
Worn and weary from my over-arduous
job.
And so the weeks went by
Until one day, with a sigh,
I shoved the final cobbler through the
door,
Gathered in the cocky’s pay,
And staggered on me way
From the toughest blanky shed I ever
shore.

“Pfella”: I’m not very much impressed
with “Up North’s” statement that white
ants transport gold and other minerals from
below the earth’s surface to enrich their
residence (B. 3/7/’29). I’ve had such a
lot to do with termites that once I fried a
quantity as a savory, but they weren’t any
good. However, that has nothing to do with
what I’m telling you. White ants do not
carry building material to the scene of their
labors like a liod-carrier humps his bricks.
They masticate pure earth and wood, and
every little grain of stone is carefully cleaned
and heaped out of the way. The working ant
ejects his material, then carefuly smooths
it on the passage side, leaving the outer
rough. A prospector “dishing” the stuff
would be severely handicapped owing to the
sticky substance with which the ant mixes
his mortar; in fact, boiling water is neces-
sary to treat the earth. Where I have
actually seen a speck of gold showing in
ironstone and quartz in a crude earth-and-
rock structure was at Gosnells (W..A.).
A retired miner built himself a bush chim-
ney to his hut, and only saw the metal
when it was pointed out to him.

HIS FATHER : “No, Issy. A taxidermist only skins der lower

a while after a new fence is erected in coun-
try where ’roos are plentiful, almost every
morning yields a crop of the hoppers caught
in the wires, sometimes by the fore, some-
times by the hind legs, and sometimes lying
dead against the fence with marks on the
chest showing plainly where they have im-
pacted. A new fence erected recently at
Cumnock (N.S.W.) gave its morning harvest
of defunct ’roos for three months. When
I was round the Georgina River and C-lon-
curry districts (Q.) 30-odd years ago, ’roo
shooters used regularly to ride new fences,
and their morning’s harvest of skins often
exceeded the rest of the day’s winnings.
Incidentally, the state of the heart and lungs
of those found dead from impact gives a
graphic account of the force of their jump.
* * * *
“1.D.”: Re the word “cobber,” which
N.S.W. Judge Curlewis doesn’t like.. In the
Monaro dialect cobra means head, to]p, sum-
mit. Cobra-bald, a mountain behind Old
Eucumbene station, Adaminaby district,.is a
combination of ab o.
and English. It is (or
was) quite bare and
barren at the top. Mr.
Harnett, of Old Eu-
cumbene, father of the
present John Harnett
of (Cooma, had a very
hairless head, and the
blacks often heard the
word “bald” and knew
its meaning. One day
some of them pointed
to the mountain, and
said, “Cobra bald —
Cobra bald,” and the.
name stuck. This at
least was the story
told to my father when
he was a little boy.
The late Mr. C. A.
Middleton, an official
of the Postal Depart-
ment in the early days
(he was in the G.P.O.
when there were only
fo u r telegraphists),
knew the Hunter
River blacks when he
was a boy, and he told
me that cobra meant
head in their dialect
also—rather a coinci-
dence, the places being
so far apart. Can 1
wander from cobra for
a minute? Once in the
Hunter River district,
the family was mov-
ing, and one of the
gins was asked, “What
we call this place,
Mary?” “Koompar-
too,” she answered,
and then told them
that this me ant
"Go another place.” Curiously, in ray collec-
tion of aboriginal words, gathered from very
many sources, I have its meaning noted
for the Collarenebri district as “A fresh
start.”

“G.8.L.” : Poowong is not' the only Vic.
town labelled with Binghi’s word for blow-
fly (B. 17/7/’29) ; Korrumburra perpetu-
ates a local tribe’s name for the same insect.
N. S. Wales’s very tony Burradoo, by the
way, was the native word for louse, and
Marrar is a big spider. But, then, Binglii
had a mania for giving names of objection-
able things.
* * * *
“Pick”: When emus or kangaroos are
feeding out on a plain. Binglii emerges from
an adjacent forest with one arm raised and
his gun (if he’s got a gun—if not, his
spear) held at an angle, to counterfeit a
burnt tree with two straggling limbs. Mak-
ing a few rapid light
steps forward as the
animals bend to feed,
he assumes a rigid
posture on their rising
to look around, and
preserves this attitude
until he has reached
within gunshot of his
unsuspecting quarry.
When ducks arc on a
lake he swims out
from some sheltered
cove, pushing ahead a
floating log as cover
and a rest for his gun.
The birds disregard
drifting timber, and
are thus deceived until
a shot is thrown
amongst them. Far out
over a mudflat or
sandy stretch they are
reached by means of
crawling behind, a
mass of weeds, slowly
rolled along. Birds
perched on a tree do
not notice a bush that
gradually draws nearer
until a shot from 1 its
midst reveals the
stratagem of a dusky huntsman.

“Adeß.”: To his list of those creatures
which find netting-fences a convenient way
of suicide, “Hayband” (B. 19/6/'29) . might
add ducks, plain turkeys, emus and wallabies.
Where netting crosses shallow lagoons and
watercourses, during the wet season ducks
get enmeshed by the dozen ; and plain turkeys,
feeding near fences, when taking to wing
often hit the netting with fatal result. The
silly emu pokes at it, gently at first, and then,
finding resistance, backs a short distance and
rushes the obstacle; and as the meshes en-
tangle its long awkward neck it gets furious,
races along for a few hundred yards and
charges again and again till it cracks some-
thing. It sometimes, too, entangles its legs
in the meshes in attempting to rip the netting
with its powerful talons. The wallaby goes
through much the same performance. Both
bunny and the wild pig show much more
intelligence by burrowing underneath.
WHAT SHE WAS MISSING.
REVELLER (to Samaritan who has brought him home ): “Don’t
knock any more (hie) —let ’er wait."
“McDookie”: The storekeepers of Goul-
burn Valley (Vic.) town used to be worried
by the local habit of distinguishing people
as Cocky Tom’s Lazy Tom, Lazy Tom’s
Jockey Tom, and so on. The business people
finally instituted a number system. Now
T. Ryan No. 6 is clearly distinguished from
T. Ryans Nos. 1,2, 3, 4 and 5, and you only
hear about Cocky Tom’s Lazy Tom’s Tom
round the log fires of the oldest members of
the tribe.

“Silentio”: The cungevoi lily was given a
bad name by the Council some months ago,
and now a death has been found due to its
poison. The victim lived at Leichhardt
(Sydney), and was a small child. There
have been many cases of sickness from it
in country districts, but so far as the doctors
know this is the first fatal case in N. S.
Wales.

“M.L.C.”: Cold blooded, as applied to
reptiles and fishes, is a misleading term. A
lizard basking on the rocks in a hot sun is
probably consider-
ably warmer than a
man picnicking
near by, but it has
no mechanism to
conserve or regu-
late heat. Mam-
mals and birds, on
the other hand,
possess a heat-regu-
lating centre situ-
ated in the brain,
which responds
immediately to the
temperature of the
blood flowing
through it. Most
of the domestic-
animals have a
temperature about
two degrees higher
than man, but
birds run from
two to fourteen de-
grees higher than
any of the mam-
mals. Possibly this
accounts for their
excessive vitality
and joie de vivre.
“Mick Anic”: I’m troubled about a little
feathered cobber of mine, a blue wren. Every
morning for the last 10 weeks I have
noticed him on the signal-arm in the colliery
siding at Fassifern (N.S.W.). He hurls
himself at the red disc —always the red —
and with wings madly fluttering and claws
groping for a toehold, you can hear his
beak working overtime on the glass. The
rounds are short but plentiful, and, he
keeps it up to the point of exhaustion. He
finally lands on the lighter’s platform with
all his feathers fluffed and looking like a
powder-puff, his mouth wide open and a fanati-
cal gleam in his eye. I have been wondering
whether he considers he has been sold a dud
radiator, or has he taken a dead set against
the red element, or has he just gone daft?

“Questo”: Let me tell “N’lmporte” (B.
10/7/’29) that kangaroos are found ne.ar
Cooktown. Kangaroos, wallaroos, wallabies
and emus can all he seen' within a mile
of the town, and I have often shot them
along the extensive river flats of the Endea-
vor. As Captain Cook was here for over
three months, no doubt he saw both kan-
garoos and wallaroos. He probably saw
the rock-wallaby also on the slopes of Mt.
(look and Mt. Saunders, which peaks he
scaled to locate the positions of reefs at sea.

“Mulga Mick”: Now that the North-South
railway has reached Alice Springs take a
trip to Florence Creek, about 80 miles east
of the Springs and 10 miles past Arltunga.
If you’re lucky you’ll see one of Australia’s
prettiest sights. When the water of the
creek subsides it leaves the sand covered
with myriads of small rubies and ruby sand.
You’ll need the luck because the creek
doesn’t often run, and in a day or two
the bed reverts to its original color
—the lighter sand drifts over. Thirty-odd
years ago there was a boom in these gems.
The trade called them garnets; yet there are
few jewellers who can tell them from
Burma rubies.

“Dog Poisoner”: “Karara” must have a
down on the canine race when lie prescribes
a teaspoon of iodine for a dog in a fit and
two teaspoons for a second fit. My dog’s
dead, poor fellow! And my opinion now is
that a teaspoon of iodine would kill an
elephant.

“Drover”: Some decent bargains can
be picked up at sales of impounded
horses. Recently, at Dongreach (W.Q.),
there was an auction of 180 horses, all of
them in good condition. A couple were sold
in the vicinity of £lO each, but the average
was under £2. As a rule, only dealers at-
tend these sales; and you know what that
means.

“E.S.” : Binghi wasn’t a scientist, but he
had legends to explain the origin of most
things in his towri. The native porcupine
was one time a big, sluggish, blood-sucking
creature with no spines. He was too slow
and too lazy to catch sufficient food for him-
self, so he robbed the black man whenever
he got the chance. The victims were annoyed,
and at last a company of hunters surrounded
the thief, and threw a shower of spears at
him before he had time to burrow into the
earth. The spears stuck fast—and that’s
how the echidna got his spines.

“Doutta-Gallan”: Choice by “Curlamo”
(B. 17/7/’29) of Moonee Ponds as one of
the “very few suburbs in Australia given
abo. names” was not fortunate, for two of
Melbourne’s own swishiest suburbs are Too-
rak and South Yarra, both native. Among
inner suburbs of high standing are Prahrau,
Murrumbeena and Carrum. And what could
be more aboriginal than Dandenong, Werri-
bee and Mordialloc, on the outer limits? If

An’ George ’e answers earnestly, “Yairs —
we’ll do that orl right!”
Wen George an’ me 'as bought our stuff I
says, “We’ll jist ’ave one;

Are trustees in N.B. W. compelled to get
the authority of their solicitors to obtai'
probate of a willf —1504.
The Registrar of Probates deals with pro-
bate matters, and if the executors under the
will have placed it in the hands of a solici-
tor to act on their behalf, the Registrar
recognises the solicitor. It is not compulsory
to employ a solicitor, but if one is employed
matters must be left in his hands.
How is tortoise-shell welded?—-3 55.
A pair of tongs or pincers, so constructed
as to reach 4in. beyond the rivet, is used;
the shell is filed clean to a lap-joint, grease
being carefully removed. Then the joint is
moistened with water, the pincers are applied
hot, but not so hot as to burn the shell;
more water is applied, and the job is done.
How can I re-finish a smallish touring
motor-car in wine color, and quantity of
materials required f—1512.
All old paint and varnish must be re-
moved by using a paint and varnish remover,
applied with an old brush. Paint the remover
on one sq. ft. at a time, allowing it to stand
for some minutes, and then use a scraper.
Wash with benzine, and allow to dry thor-
oughly. The surface should then be rubbed
down with water and sandpapered smooth.
When dry apply a coat of grey primer,
which, on drying, should be lightly sand-
papered. Brush on one coat of wine color
coach paint, which will dry in from four
to six hours. Then apply a coat of glaze
color. This is made by mixing 4oz. wine
color coach paint with | pint of hard body
varnish. Stir thoroughly so as to ensure
amalgamation. When this coat is dry it
should be lightly flatted down with very
fine sandpaper, washed down with clean
water, and dried. Then apply a coat of best
finishing varnish. Camel-hair brushes should
be used, and all brushes must be clean.
You will require 1 pint paint and varnish
remover, 1 pint grey primer, 21b. wine color,
1 pint hard-drying body varnish, 1 pint best
colorless body varnish, 1 pint pure turpen-
tine and benzine sufficient to clean car down.
After service with the A.I.F. I was dis-
charged as medically unfit. I did not apply
for a pension, but as my health has broken
down recently I am now thinking of doing
so. (1) Would such a claim be allowed?
12) Must I produce my discharge? (5)
Where should I apply? —l326.
(1) Yes, provided adequate reasons for
the delay in claiming are forthcoming and
a war disability still exists. (2) Not essen-
tial. (3) Apply to the Deputy Commissioner
of Repatriation for your State.
(1) Is there any means by which an old
motor-tyre can be flattened? (2) Is there
any means of cementing rubber to leather?
—538.
(1) Experts consider it impossible. (2)
Rubber solution, as used for tyre repairs,
will do it.
(1) Assuming that defective teeth are not
the cause of the trouble, what treatment
is recommended as a cure for sciatica in
cases where the victim is unable to afford
the fee entailed by a visit to a specialist
and the expensive treatment usually recom-
mended after treatment? (2) Is there any
form of bath-salts which has been known
to contribute to the ewe of the ailment. —lso3.
(1) Complete rest of the affected limb.
The application of heat by hot-water bottle,
local hot-air bath or Turkish bath. Avoid
alcohol and keep to restricted diet. Drugs
are not helpful as a rule and most of them
have to be taken under medical supervision.
Injections have sometimes proved valuable.
A warm, dry climate is supposed to be most
favorable. Why not get a specialist to
put you on his free list at a public hos ;
pital? (2) Bath-salts arc not recognised as
a curative agency.
My kelpie pup, aged nine months, de-
veloped a sore on the tip of one ear which,
through annoyance from flies, etc., was some
time in healing. Ever since the tip of the
ear falls over. What treatment is recom-
mended to restore perpendicularity?— l22s.
May be some damage to the nerve in the
region, hampering control of the muscles.
Try regular massage of the part.
(1) Recipe for making a wood-dye; par-
ticularly one for rendering Australian oak
blackwood color? (2) Is there any Aus-
tralian book on the subject? —7l4.
The easiest method of obtaining a black-
wood color on Tasmanian oak, which is,
presumably, what you mean by “Australian
oak,.’’ is to use burnt umber or walnut cry-
stals. Burnt umber is obtainable as a paste,
ground in water, and can be diluted with
more water until the desired color is ob-
tained. Walnut crystals are water soluble,
and after a few trials the necessary color
should be obtained. (2) We don’t know
of any.
What ingredients should be used in an
adhesive to join fairly smooth surfaces in
a temperature of 90 deg. F.f —1474.
Artists’ flake white-oil paint, sold in tubes
in art-color shops, may be used. Brush
on fairly thickly, press the parts together,
and when dry trim off any surplus paint.
This takes about a week to dry, and is better
left longer. Also, good results are obtained
by placing alum in an iron spoon, melting
it over a clean flame, and applying while
hot. Delicate manipulation is required, and
patient fitting of the surfaces.
(1) Is a Maorilander who has passed the
6 th standard eligible to take the icool-class-
ing course at Sydney Technical College? (2)
Cost of course, period and next date of
commencement? (3) How can I enrol?
(4) What are the chances of obtaining a
position on completion of course? —l27s.
(1) Yes. (2) £lO 10s.; £5 ss. for each of
two sessions, occupying a year. The course
starts on February 1 each year. (3)
Send application for enrolment to the Super-
intendent. Technical College, Sydney. If it
is desired to join 1030 session, this should
be done immediately. (4) Depends on the
individual, but, as a rule, quite good.
(1) / hade made tico concrete fence posts,
both of flic same material and the same mix-
ture. One I put in the mould very wet and
the other I put in very much dryer, but
thoroughly rammed. They have both come
out well. Is there any difference in the
strength of the two ; and, if so, why.’ (3)
Which would be the stronger for fence posts
and walls, a mixture 4 or 5 to 1,4 in. thick,
or a mixture 6 or 7 to 1,6 in. thickf —1532.
(1) Dry mixing is generally productive
of stronger concrete, provided the limits of
workability are not exceeded. Loss of
strength is more often traceable to. an excess
of water than the reverse. (2) A good deal
would depend on the quality of the cement,
but, speaking in general terms, the 4 to 1
mix., 4in. thick, should be much stronger
than a 7 to 1 mix., Gin. thick. It' you will
send the Aus. Cement Manufacturers’ Assoc.,
14 Spring-street, Sydney, details as to the
nature of the sand available and the pur-
pose for which the concrete is intended, they
will be pleased to give you detailed advice.
(1) What were the highest temperatures
recorded at Bourkc and Narrabri ( N.S.W. )
last summer? (2) Highest temperature ever
recorded at Moreet —l36l.
(1) Bourke, 113 deg. on January 7. 1920;
Narrabri, 110 deg. on January 18, 1929. (2)
117 deg. on January. 1, 1909.
How do the insects called “jumpers” get
into Gorgonzola cheese? Are they put there
as part of the process of manufacture or
are they the result of neglect? —l47o.
“Jumpers” or “skippers” are sit times
found in various types of cheese containing
sufficient moisture for their development.
They are not introduced by any process, but
are the result of exposure of surfaces or
cracked rind at some stage after manufacture.
.4 man having been sacked from a station
and told never to return to it obtains work
on the same place under an assumed name
*some months later and works for several
weeks before he is discovered and dismissed
again. (1 )Can he claim a week’s notice or
pay in lieu thereof under the Federal award?
(2) Is he entitled to pay for working on
/Sundays? If so, how much? (3) Can pay
be refused on the ground that he obtained
work under false pretences? —l62B.
(1 and 3) Under the circumstances, which
disclose a wilful disobedience, by means of
a subterfuge, of the employer’s instruction
not to return to work on the station, it is
highly improbable that the claim would be
sustained. (2) The station-hands’ hours are
52 per week, all time worked in excess of
52 hours to be paid for at time and a half,
irrespective of the days upon which the
overtime is worked. Station-hands can be
asked to do necessary work on Sundays.
In “The Quartermaster,” dealing with
Sydney’s early days, the City-road is men-
tioned. Was it the City-road at the time of
the story? —l64l.
In the ’thirties and ’forties it was the
Cook’s River-road. Then for a while it
was Newtown-road. City-road is a compara-
tively modern name.
How much concrete would, be necessary for
a cricket pitch? Best mixture to use? —1366.
For a pitch of standard dimensions, 66ft.
by 6ft. Bin., to a depth of 3in., 4 cub. yds. of
concrete. A mixture of one part of cement
two parts of sand and three parts of stone
is recommended. The foundation should be
excavated to a depth of sin. and a cushion
course of 2in. of sand or ashes, well consoli-
dated, interposed between foundation and
concrete. The pitch should be divided every
22ft. .by means of an expansion joint and
the adjoining slabs connected by means of
edge dowel bars.
Is it unlawful for a person in Sydney to
act as agent and receive commission in con-
nection with the sale or letting of property
without being a registered house and land,
agent?— l62l.
No. Any individual can act as an agent
for the selling or letting of property, but if
trading as a firm or partnership the business
must be registered with the Registrar-
General. The fee is 7s. 6d. if registered
before starting business, or 15s. after start-
ing business.
(1) Where cun I get a■ list of published
works dealing with Australia or printed in
Australia prior to 1901'? (2) What are
copies of the N.S.W. Historical Records
ivorth? —1616.
(11 The Public Library of N.S.W. pub-
lished an “Australasian Bibliography” in 1888.
“The Australian Catalogue, a reference index
to the books and periodicals published and
still current in the Commonwealth,” by Fox-
croft, was printed in Melbourne in 1911.
(2) From ss. to 10s. each.
How can I briny white plaster-of-paris
walls back to their original color when they
have been badly stained by smoke. Also
fancy fibrous-plaster ceilings affected in the
same ivay ? —1557.
Brush the walls well with a soft broom or
stair brush, and give a final rub over with a
woollen cloth. Then apply two or three coats
of kalsomine or hycohte, the latter being
a kind of kalsomine which gives a soft
papered effect. The ceilings may be done the
same way, or given two or three coats of
flat white enamel paint.
How can I remove perspiration stains from
white canvas cricket boots? —1639.
Hold the sole in the hand, and dip the
canvas portion up and down in pure petrol
until clean. Set to dry upturned on sticks or
pegs, and press into shape as necessary
during drying.

535.—T0 smoke Murray cod : Split small
fish open into two slabs and remove the back-
bone —always the first part to go bad. Divide
large fish into cutlets one inch thick, also
removing the backbone. Build your smoke-
house of galvanised iron, making sure it is
blowfly-proof, and after salting the fish for
one day hang on wires placed horizontally
across the smokehouse. See that no two
pieces of fish arc touching. Fill an old pan
with clean, dry pine or she-oak sawdust,
place a teaspoon of saltpetre in the centre,
lay a red-hot coal alongside the saltpetre,
put the pan in the bottom of the smoke-
house and shut the door. Renew the saw-
dust every few hours and keep the fire
smouldering for at least 36 hours. Store the
smoked fish by hanging on strings in a dry
cellar.— “Larrapihta.”

WINTER SPORTS IN SWITZERLAND
SKIING originated in Norway, but Switzerland, because of its incomparable Alpine slopes and its accessible position
in the centre of Europe, is now the real home of this exciting sport. During the season Continental life is here
at its liveliest, and one may be assured of every comfort in one’s hotel after each happy and strenuous day on the
snow. After the Swiss season comes the season on the Riviera, and a very enjoyable few weeks may be spent in
the South, of France before crossing to England for the Spring.
To arrive in Switzerland for the Winter Sports travel to Europe by the Otranto , the Orford, the Oronsay, the Orontes or
the Orama the five 20,000 ton steamers of the Orient Line which leave Australia in November. December and January.

MORE PRIZES FOR FARMERS.
In order to encourage farmers to pass
on to others the fruits of their observa-
tion and experience, “The Bulletin” will
give three prizes for the most helpful
contributions during the six months to
Dec. 31 next.
Points will be awarded for every con-
tribution submitted, if thought worthy and
whether printed or not, and two prizes—
the first of £25 and the second of £lo—
be given to the winners of most
points.
A special prize of £5 will be given for
’-he best individual contribution.
Only contributions that are of practical
value to men on the land are asked for;
literary merit is not taken into account, so
long as the meaning is expressed plainly.
The prizes are in addition to the ordi-
nary payments made for all “Bulletin”
contributions.
O
RICE AS A FEEDING PROPOSITION.
"Deejay”; With the rice harvest on the
Hurrumbidgee Irrigation Area of N.S.W.
almost a record, and supplies for the whole
of the needs of the Commonwealth assured,
there will be broken and inferior grain avail-
able for stock feeding. Already chemists
are handling it with a view to inclusion in
prepared stock and poultry foods, but before
anything comes on to the market farmers can
use a good deal in its ordinary state.
Already rice bran is available, but having
tested it pretty well I can’t see anything to
recommend it for extensive use. Rice pollard
| have used, too, but not of Australian manu-
iacture. It was secured during one of those
tunes when mill offal was scarce, and came
from overseas. It proved to be a great feed,
and its only drawback was its stickiness in
mixing. For pig feeding it made a very fat-
tening drink, very glutinous, especially if
boiled. A little was added to the' skim
milk for the poddies, and they thrived on
it too. For ducks and fowls I used it in
the mash, but it needed twice as much bran
and chaffed greenstuff or soaked lucerne
chaff to make a crumbly food. But whilst
the egg production seemed to remain steady
for fowls, I noticed that it seemed to increase
the weight in growing stock, especially young
ducks.
Handling it _ to-day (whole) I annually
use it for growing chickens, boiling it in the
same way as for human consumption, and
teed it to them twice or three times a week,
in the middle of the day. If the price eases
a bit more-—I pay 4d. a lb.—l’ll use far more
than I do now. On my observations and tests
il makes chicks thrive as well as those having
a milk addition to their diet, either as a
powder in the mash or to drink. Any surplus
water with which it is boiled is used for
mash-mixing or the pigs. A little broken
rice is often added to the chick wheat and
fed dry. It is quickly cleaned up by young
and old birds.
Whilst a whole rice ration would not be
successful owing to its starch content, a
reasonable addition has proved to be beneficial
to my flock, and this comment is given on
the acid test-of use.
THE DUAL-PURPOSE HERD.
“Ooline”: “Coolibah’s” par puts me in
nmid of a dairyman who was trying to sell a
bull of doubtful pedigree. In stating his
reason for selling, lie mentioned that he
started with Jersey cows, then used first
an Ayrshire bull, next a Guernsey, followed
by a shorthorn; “and,” he said, “I have
k pt this fellow for a couple of years, just
to round off the cross.” It is quite evident
that there are many such breeders in tlic
dairying parts of Queensland. The poorer
the quality the poorer the dairyman.
Jerseys are in favor mostly because they
are not hard to keep, and everything that
goes down the Jersey cow’s neck is, as a
rule, turned to good account. Friesians,
although big, are hardy, and I have seen
pure-bred cows of that breed last longer than
either Jerseys or I.M.S.’s in a dry time. The
bullocks, however, are hard and big-boned,
as a rule.
For districts where the areas are on a
fairly large scale the I.M.S. is the ideal cow.
The yield of butterfat is little if anything
below that of the Jersey. With an area
sufficient to enable the dairyman to milk 30
of these cows all the year round and keep his
young stock to the three-year-old stage, the
niau on the land would be on a good wicket.
The drudgery of dairying is cut out to a
groat extent if the cream cheque alone is
not depended on. I have seen I.M.S. bullocks
from a good milking herd in the first ten of a
hundred fats being picked- from a mob of
200 beef shorthorns of good quality. That
is, there were three milking shorthorns in
the 200, and they were in the first 10
bullocks cut out for the butcher.
In western Queensland, however, the
I.M.S. cattle do not appear to be so hardy
since the old Talgai-Musket strain is dying
out. They are better to look at and put on
condition more rapidly in a good season, but
they go under more quickly in a drought.
SELECTING THE DAIRY-COW.
“Irad”: The cow that is entitled to be
called a dairy-cow will produce in one year,
or lactation period, when she is mature, at
least 2751 b. of butter-fat. The average Aus-
tralian production is far below 2001 b. This
low average does not result from a shortage
of feed, poor water or severe weather; it
comes from using cows bred for other than
dairy purposes.
In comparing the different dairy breeds,
we should rank them as follows for size:
Holstein, Shorthorn, Ayrshire, Guernsey and
Jersey. As milk-producers they are ranked
in the same order; but for milk richest in
butter-fat their order is reversed—Jersey,
Guernsey, Ayrshire, Shorthorn and Holstein.
As to total amount of butter-fat produced,
there is really very little difference between
the breeds.
In selecting a dairy-cow, no matter what
the breed, her make-up must be such as to
allow the greatest development of the organs
that are important in milk-production.
Quality is indicated by fine hair; soft,
loose and mellow skin of medium thickness;
and clean bone, lacking coarseness. Tem-
perament is indicated by a lean, neat appear-
ance when in milk; by a large, full, mild
eye. She should have a large muzzle, a
strong jaw and large barrel that much feed
may be consumed and digested. The size of
the milk veins, and also the size of the milk
wells, are good indicators. These veins, gen-
erally two in number, one on each side of the
belly, should be long and crooked; in many
cases they are branched. The milk wells,
which are the holes through the body-wall
admitting the milk veins, should be large.
It is not uncommon to find cows with two
or three wells on each side. If the udder
has the right quality, it will appear-spongy,
and when _ empty will be soft and flexible
and hang in folds. The quarters should be
even in size, and the bottom of the udder
fiat. The teats should be large and set
squarely on each quarter. Udders that are
coarse, funnel-shaped or pendulous are not
desirable.
Indications of a good constitution are
(1) large nostrils and (2) a large chest,
so that the heart and lungs have plenty
of room. This means that there must be
good depth from the top of the shoulders to
the floor of the chest, with well-arched fore-
ribs. Judge the width of the floor of the
chest by passing the hand under the body
just behind the fore-legs. Her back should
be straight and strong. A common defect
is lowness of the back. The hips should be 1
wide and level with the back. The rump
should be long and wide, and the thighs long,",
thin and wide apart.
THE ALSATIAN.
Dear Bulletin, — If the Act passed in the
reign of William IV., which I believe has
never been repealed, were rigidly enforced,
it would be all-sufficient protection against
potential damage by Alsatians.
To quote those portions of the Act which
are relative;—
Any dog found at large in Sydney, Parramatta,
Liverpool or Windsor without being under the
immediate custody, protection or control of some
competent person, or unless such dog shall have a
collar round its neck with the name and address of
the owner legibly engraven thereon shall be liable
to be immediately destroyed, and all persons are
hereby authorised, and all constables especially
ordered and required, to seize, kill and destroy anv
such dog.
And then further :
Any dog attacking any person or animal may
be destroyed by any person whomsoever if the attack
be not on premises, belonging to or occupied by the
owner or keeper of such dog.
Plainly the Act would need to be amended
to cover Australia.
Those Alsatian or German shepherd-dogs
were first imported into Australia some 22
years ago by Air. A. G. Sewell. If the
breed is a potential danger to sheep, why
were not precautions taken in connection
with the first importations'? Those original
dogs did no wrong. Why assume that those
of to-day are less trustworthy?
Grossed with the dingo the Alsatian would
be a menace; but would it be any more
so than the greyhound or the Airedale-ter-
rier? Then wily discriminate? The value
of the class of greyhounds or terriers which
wcTuld be taken into the country districts
for useful purposes would be infinitesimal
compared with Alsatians, which cost as many
pounds as the others do shillings, a fact
which alone would ensure far greater care
being used to prevent Alsatians running wild.
—Yours, C. Court Rice.
PREVENTING IMPACTION.
“Hornby”: One of the greatest troubles of'
sheepmen these dry, scrub-feeding- times is
impaction, and many correctives are tried,
most of them failures. Air. Myers, overseer
of Cuttabloo station, near Binnaway
(N.S.W.), hus made exhaustive experiments
and gives the palm to molasses and salt.
Here’s his recipe. Thoroughly mix four gal-
lons of molasses with one bag of salt and lay
out in troughs. Then drive the sheep to it
and leave them. After their first taste they’ll
return voluntarily every day. The best
troughs are those adzed from logs, the longer
the better. The depth of the troughs does, not
matter, but don’t have them any wider than
the adze blade, or the sheep will get their
feet into them and carry away much more of
the mixture than they eat. Horses and
cattle soon find the troughs for themselves
and similarly benefit.
SHEEP’S TEETH AND AGE.
“Cucliulain” : “Mungallala” (B. 17/7/’29)
quotes the table for telling the sheep’s age
from its teeth. But those who look only to
the teeth will find trouble some day. The
only true selling age of a sheep is the date
of its lambing. From the study of the
mouth only a rough guess at the age can be
made.
It is usually represented, as “Alungallala”
quotes, that two, four and six teeth stand for
one, two and three years ; but whether the
teeth really correspond with the age accord-
ing to. the lambing list depends entirely on
conditions. Seasons and state of country
on which the sheep are bred are responsible
for the advancement or retarding of the
teeth ; whatever the age of the sheep, they
may be either backward or forward, judging
by their teeth. Thus a bad season, with
drought and consequent poor feed or scarcity,
results in the teeth being slow and back-
ward. I have frequently seen 18-montlis
sheep which had still only their lambs’
teeth, two-year-olds had only two teeth, and
so on, or vice versa.
In offering sheep for sale, therefore, sellers
knowing their business list sheep with date
of lambing. It is often found that the teeth
do not correspond with it.
BROKEN KNEES.
“Irad” : If the wound is a simple abrasion
with no discharge, leave it alone and let it
heal dry. If it is deep, and dirt has entered,
bathe with warm water for a few minutes;
but if there is no foreign body in the cut,
the application of water serves no useful
purpose.
Poulticing or continued fomentations
should on no account be employed; they en-
courage suppuration. If, however, there is a
discharge, gently syringe the wound a few
times a day with an antiseptic solution.
Tannoform or iodoform are good for parts of
such low vitality.
Generally speaking the main object is to
heal the wound so as to leave the least
possible blemish. It is advisable to apply
a cantharidin blister to the back and sides
'of the knee to increase the vitality of the
part affected. The vitality of horses’ legs is
very low compared with other parts of the
body, and the higher the vitality the greater
are the healing powers. If a blister does no
appreciable good, it will never do any harm.
When the wound is very well on the road
to healing remove the scab every few days
so the least possible blemish will be left.
This also tends to check the growth of white
hairs.
SPRING BRINGS ITS PESTS.
“Deejay” : They can, be put roughly into
four classes —chewing insects, sucking in-
sects, scales and fungus diseases.
Taking the last first —oidium, rust, black
spot, mildew and others —the best way to
beat them is by regular spraying with a good
high-powered spray early in the season, and
the daddy of all mixtures is lime-sulphur,
with Bordeaux mixture second. Dry dusting
can be carried out, too, by means of proper
bellows, but spraying at three weekly inter-
vals from now on is best.
For the scales, of which white or Indian
wax is the chief, and to which citrus trees
are prone, the treatment is best done after
Christmas for a month or two, and you can’t
beat ordinary washing soda—lib. to* 21b. to a
kerosene-tin of hot water, and sprayed on
wlnle warm. Apples and persimmons in some
districts get a touch of this trouble, drub
out any blackthorn that is near the garden,
as it is a great breeding ground for white
scale.
The chewing insects include the cater-
pillar, grasshopper, eodlin-moth, pumpkin
beetle, slugs, snails and many of the countless
beetle family. In general arsenate of lead is
the surest kill for these chaps; Paris green,
l™ e .~ su lphur and black leaf 40 are most
efhcient in special cases. For pumpkin
beetles, snails and such like, dusting is besr.
lor the pumpkin beetle, which attacks the
melons, squash and such crops each year, I
prefer a mixture of equal parts slacked lime
and wood ashes, with a little arsenate of
lead, dusted on while the dew is on th<*
plants, renewing at intervals.
The aphis and other sucking bugs need
constant watching; trees and plants will be
clean one morning and covered the next,
llarbas, black-leaf 40 and benzole emulsion
are the best sprays for this class, and not a
bad spray can be made at home from tobacco
leaves soaked in a bucket of hot suds dipped
from the copper on washing day, with the
addition of some kerosene.
Keep all the lines away from the kids;
they (the lines —not the kids) are poison.
THE CITRUS TREE.
‘ X.5.A.”: More quickly than any other
fruiti-bearers citrus trees display distress
signals which cannot be mistaken. No trees
respond more faithfully to proper treatment
and none resent more broken-heartedly any
neglect when these signals are hoisted.
A healthy citrus grove should always
present an unparalleled study of rich green
—the darker the better—excepting when
young shoots in autumn intensify the beauty
by way of contrasts. Leaves should be large
and almost brittle with health. Trees should
he well covered to the ground with foliage,
the barrels protected from extremes of sun
or frost. Insides pruned well and no rub-
bishy growth permitted there.
This is the ideal, but is seen only where
the. successful man is operating. In a
majority of orchards, comprising many hun-
dreds, recently visited, every distress signal
was noticeable. And this in districts famed
for suitability of soil.
Citrus trees have no right to turn yellow.
The color is unnatural. No citrus tree ever
grew into profitable bearing with yellow
leaves. Apart from cultural neglect or scale
there are only two causes for this: wet feet
(i.c., lack of drainage) and, probably the
prime cause, lack of nitrogen.
In the famous Hills district of N. S.
Wales drainage is easily overcome and the
lack of nitrogen met by ample applications of
sulphate of ammonia. Although most of the
growers there have had to add thousands
of loads of soil to make their beds, their
methods are something to be proud of.
The notable Hawkesbury district, the home
of citrus fruits in general and mandarins in
particular, can make no such boast. Favored
w r ith magnificent soil and working witli un-
bounded zeal, the majority of growers there
are losing ground day by day. Four to
twelve pounds of sulphate of ammonia per
tree according to age will work wonders
where usual fertilisers have failed.
Citrus trees, no matter how old, should
never be tight in the bark. They should
bo kept green and sappy. If kept growing
without undue forcing, the trees will appear
youthful regardless of size. This also is an
ideal.
If the citrus orchard has gone yellow oi
staggy, provided the bark has not hardenef
cut it right back and work from new younj
wood. Many I recently visited should be cui
right out and a fresh grove planted. Unless
one is prepared to work on entirely differenl
lines the best advice is to grow something
else.
There is some small excuse for an odd
tree which may have root trouble, but abso-
lutely none in these days of specialisation
for a whole orchard to fly signals of distress.
POTATO DISEASES.
“R.X.8.”: As one who has spent a lot
of time in laboratory and field investigat-
ing lihizoctonia of potatoes, I did not like
the par. by “Curlew” (B. 24/7/’29) much.
It leaves too much unsaid, for one thing.
Farmers know the disease best by one of
its many aliases. And “Curlew’s” remarks
may tend to perpetuate the old fallacy that
a diseased crop has resulted from planting
fork-stabbed or otherwise injured tubers.
Certainly an injury would provide an easy
entrance for the spores of Rliizoctonia, but
the potato or the soil must have been in-
fected first.
It is variously known as black-speck scab,
as wet-rot or dry-rot (according to the sea-
son ), as collar-stem rot, as dry-brown rot. in
Tasmanian potatoes as brown rust, and (be-
cause the disease causes a number of voung
plants to die) as the blight (miscalled).
That is not a complete list of aliases, but if
I give others it may be inferred that all

Have you ever considered the many advantages of buying petrol in
bulk? Those who have generally regard the storage question as the
stumbling block. We have made an outfit to solve this very problem.
The “Macson" Petrol Storage Outfit is proving very popular, especially
in country districts.
It comprises a strong, electrically-welded steel container, to which a
Semi-rotary Pump, especially adapted for pumping petrol, is connected
by strong, suitable piping. A 1 Oft. length of petrol hose with brass
nozzle is supplied, also a filler pipe. An air vent is fitted to t e
container.
The “Macson” Outfit can be placed wherever convenient, but probably
the best place is underground, outside the garage. Here the petrol is
safer from fire than it is when in tins. Another advantage is the saving
of space in the garage.

FITZROY, VICTORIA.
rots, scabs and blights are necessarily
Rhizoctonia, and, indeed, eight out of every
ten I investigated were.
If a crop is affected with Rhizoctonia you
may be very sure that the reason will be
found in one or more of the following:
(.1) The crop was infected when it was
planted. All seed, whatever its origin or
the guarantees you get with it, must be
treated before it is sown or you may expect
trouble. Of the two methods of treatment
the formalin method advocated by “Curlew”
is troublesome, and there is still some doubt
as to what strength the formalin should be.
Treatment with, corrosive sublimate is easier
and more certain. The solution is made by
adding soz. of the chemical to 30gal. water.
A half-cask is the best vessel to use, and
should be kept for this and no other purpose,
and the seed should be bathed in the solution
for two hours. Corrosive sublimate is
poisonous and great care should be taken
that no rejected tubers are eaten by stock,
and the hands should be thorougnly cleansed
after working the seed. When the sets
are being cut, reject any that show brown
rings or blotches. I am aware that the gen-
eral practice is to plant whole sets, but
that is not good business.
(2) If the land is too wet, especially as
a result of bad drainage, it will grow a
splendid crop of Rhizoctonia but a very
poor crop of tubers. Such conditions will
introduce the disease to a crop grown from
the cleanest seed.
(3) Practise proper rotation. Thoroughly-
worked fallows and cereals should follow a
crop of spuds for at least two years, and
longer if it can be arranged. If a crop has
been diseased, be sure that the digging is
done well. Burn all the dried haulms you
can rake together. Then work the land as
a fallow, and especially give it a turn-over
between frosts in elevated districts. Any
cereal suitable to the district can be sown
as a rotation-crop, but aim to have a heavy
crop drying-off just when you want to plough
the land to be ready for spuds again. Jap-
anese millet is the best, Burn it. It sounds
a bit wasteful, but the heat will sweeten
the ground and kill numerous diseases, and
ash is the best of all fertilisers for spuds.
GINGER GROWING.
“Agricola” : Owners of mixed farms look-
ing about for a side-line might do worse
than turn attention to ginger, which
promises to become a pretty good industry
in Queensland. The district where it has
been established is the south coast of the
State, between Brisbane and Maryborough,
and more ground is being put under crop
every year. The climate and soil are much
like those of many parts of the N.S.W. north
coast, but there is no reason to suppose
that it will not succeed in other districts.
A firm, sandy, shallow soil has been found
the most suitable, with a good drainage,
and a fair amount of water is necessary,
though this must not be allowed to lie.
The plants are put in 6in. apart in rows
at Ift. intervals. After planting they should
be mulched with dried grass or other cover.
i\o pests have been encountered as yet,
though slugs have to be combated, as with
peas and similar crops.
The ginger of commerce is of two vari-
eties, roots and knuckles; the latter, appear-
ing on the plant above ground, are less
fibrous and are employed in confectionery
and chutney, while the root ginger is chiefly
used for crystallisation. The longer the plant
is left in the ground, the more it is inclined
to harden, so when a tender quality is
required pulling must be done earlier. In
Queensland, the gathering of the crop lasts
from April to July, and it is important to
grade the qualities. The stuff is bagged
for market and carries well.
Imported ginger is worth about £62 per
ton or about 6|d. per lb. A large firm of
Australian confectioners and the Queensland
State cannery are paying 9d. per lb. for the
local article, which is of better quality than
the imported. At present there is no duty
on the latter, but if production stands up
to tests, as it looks like doing, protection
will probably be sought.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
On what basis of valuation does the
Federal Tax Department tax conditional
leases? Are they treated as freehold and
taxed on their freehold value, or are they
taxed as leasehold, as by the shires? —ls6s.
The freehold basis is used as one of the
factors in calculating the value of the lease-
hold on which the assessment is made. The
unimproved value of the lease is the value
of the amount by which 4£ P-c. of the free-
hold unimproved value of the land exceeds
the annual rent reserved by the lease, cal-
culated for the unexpired period of the lease
at 4\ p.c. A typical example is: Unimproved
value of land on freehold basis; £10,000;
per cent, of £lO,OOO, £450; Annual rent
reserved by the lease, £300; excess of
unimproved value over rent, £150; capitalis-
ing factor at 4-£ per cent, according to pre-
scribed tables for an unexpired period of a
lease of 20 years, 13,298; value of the land
for assessment purposes, £l5O multiplied by
13.298, or £1995.
(1) Method of extracting oil of mint from
peppermint or spearmint? (2) Class of land
suitable for growing mint? (3) Gallons of
mint oil per acre per annum? (4) Price of
oil in Sydney? (5) Is the market over-
supplied? (6) Method of harvesting? (7)
Literature on. subject? (8) Is mint-growing
a paying proposition in N.S.W.? —1211.
(1) The oil is extracted by a process of
steam distillation, details of which are too
comprehensive to be described here. Full
particulars of stills, their equipment and
cost of production of the oil can be obtained
from the Curator of the Sydney Technologi-
cal Museum, Harris-street, Ultimo, Sydney.
(2) No information is available regarding
Australian conditions, but in Great Britain
any soil which is well drained gives appa-
rently good results with the exception of
heavy clay. The crop pays best in open
sunny situations where the rainfall is not
excessive. (3) The yields vary from 201 b.
to 901 b. per acre, according to the class of
land, fertilisers used and general conditions.
Don’t expect more than a general average
of 201 b. to 301 b. per acre. (4) 18s. to 20s.
per lb, wholesale for large quantities. (5)
Can’t say. (6) The plants are harvested
when in bloom or just before the flowers
open ; the herb is cut with scythes or mowers,
allowed to wilt in the field for several days
in fair weather, and then distilled. (7) Don’t
know of any special book on the subject. In-
formation is scattered throughout literature
dealing with essential-oil-yielding plants.
(8) Depends upon the yield of oil and more
particularly its quality as judged by the
aroma. Cultivation of essential-oil-yielding
crops is especially subject to unfavorable
seasonal conditions and is rather precarious.
My horse has fallen away in condition.
He cats little, stamps his feet while feeding,
• and is often touchy about the flanks, sweat-
ing there when not working. He rolls on
the ground immediately the bridle is taken
off. What’s wrong? —l62o.
Many horses roll on the ground immedi-
ately the bridle is taken off, so this cannot
be accepted as a symptom of disease. The
falling away in condition and the other
symptoms point to worm infestation. Give
one ounce of Fowler’s solution of arsenic
in the morning feed for eight days, and at
the end of that period administer a thysic
ball, preceding it with a bran mash. Con-
tinue mashing until the purgative acts, then
gradually go on to hard feed. Occasionally
the horse should get linseed-tea made from
pure linseed.
Would the Russell River ( N.Q.) alluvial
flats be suitable for lucerne-growing? —l4B4.
No, for the following reasons: (1) An-
alyses of Russell River soil show a lack of
lime and a corresponding strong acidity.
Lucerne requires a calcareous soil, so the
lack of lime is a strong drawback. (2)
The rainfall, 120 inches, is excessive for this
crop. (3) The danger of floods. Lucerne
is killed outright by being submerged for
24 hours.
I bought a plough from a neighbor' who
has left the district. The makers are look-
ing for it because, so they say, it has not
been fully paid for. (1) Can they seize it?
(2) What ought to happen the man who
sold it? —1605.
(1) As, apparently, the property in the
plough is still in the makers, they are entitled
to recover it. (2) If the neighbor, know-
ingly, by means of a false pretence that he
was the . true owner of the plough and
entitled to dispose of it, obtained the pur-
chase money, he could be prosecuted. But
you should make sure of your ground before
taking action.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Tanguloli”: Lately it was stated that a
grazier on the Murrumbidgee had been feed-
ing his sheep on paddy-rice. Rats, mice and
weevils do not attack paddy-rice. The
Indians in Fiji store paddy-rice from year to
year, loose on an earth floor. Also by well
mixing 41b. to 61b. of salt with each bag of
maize you can keep the grain free from
weevil.
“Cliooky”: Wood-preserving oil or crude
kerosene will rid the fowl-house of lice and
other parasites, but black-leaf 40 is a more
efficient cleanser; it will kill both the insects
and their eggs. It can be painted on ; if it
is used for spraying, it can be broken down
with hot water and soap—one or two table-
spoons to a gallon of water and a little piece
of soap. Give the most pressure you can
when spraying. Some breeders believe it
keeps the houses free from the fowl tick also.
“O. J. 8.”: Unable to start the engine at
my saw-bench, I dragged it out of the way
and backed my motor-lorry into its place,
getting my offside back wheel in line with
the pulley on the saw-bench. Then I jacked
this wheel up, chocked the other three,
slipped the belt (crossed) on to the tyre, got
into second gear and let her run at 10
miles an hour. It did fine work. And so it
did later at a chaffcutter. The belt seems
to stick to the rubber tyre like glue.
“Silentio”: It has often paid me better to
send 60 miles inland than 28 to the city.
Two farmers I know live near Penrith
(N.S.W.). One sticks to the city market,
the other to the local sales and Blue Moun-
tain towns. The second man, though with a
smaller holding, is doing better than the
bigger man. Many little odd-lots will never
pay to send to the city, but will often find
ready sale inland. One grower I know
specialises in salad vegetables, and sends all
his crop right back inland. He is hit-up by
freight/but still makes a better profit than
the city could yield. There’d be a lot more
money in small farms if the owners would
use a bit of gumption in the disposal of
their products.
“De Novo”: Next time you have a sitting
of eggs addled, don’t throw them away if
you have foxes about —use them as bait
either for traps or for poisoning. We caught
four in 24 hours with four eggs. One egg
we smashed and placed with two whole ones
on a litter of straw on the track the fox
took. We trapped one fox in the morning,
one at night before we went to bed, and
one the following morning. The fourth egg
we punctured and part-drained the contents,
inserting strychnine in the hole. This caught
a vixen.
Under the N.S.W. Swine Compensation
Act 1928 a large number of claims with
respect to the condemnation of carcases have
been received outside the statutory period.
Claims not received within 21 days from
date of slaughter cannot be recommended for
payment.
“Cayenne”: Westralian users of Lanz
crude-oil tractors will have something new
in tractor service when a monoplane recently
landed to the order of the local agents for
the tractor is in commission. Doing 40
miles per gallon and SO m.p.h., the ’bus
will be seen in the country districts in
charge of an aviator-mechanic when spare
parts are urgently needed or expert advice
is wanted by the tractor owner. A take-
off run of only 28 yards is needed, and as
the ’plane can land at about 22 m.p.h.. a
landing ground should be found on most farms.
“Cuchulain”: “Mango’s” sheep-killing
horse (B. 24/7/’29) is paralleled by a peace-
able old draught belonging to a neighbor.
From time to time a calf had been found
dead or dying in the horse paddock, its back
broken. One day the owner was attracted
by frantic bellowings. A young cow was
hovering round this old draught, which had
the newly-born calf trundling along in front.
Finally he picked it up, held it as high as
he could, dropped it to the ground and pawed
it. The criminal had gone on unsuspected
for six months.

Glorifying every
tradition of a good name
A.LWAYS and in all ways Dodge Brothers motor cars have been de-
pendable. But in the new Dodge Brothers Six, even Dodge
Brothers dependability attains new heights, revealing fresh proof
of the engineering genius of Walter P Chrysler. Numerous re-
finements in construction, design and equipment have made the
new Dodge Brothers Six something more than just another auto-
mobile. About it is an air of well-bred hospitality that makes the
owner no less proud of his car than of his home. A solid achieve-
ment in honest craftsmanship, the new Dodge Brothers Six is the
greatest value in Dodge Brothers history. To skill in sturdy manu-
facture has been added the art of combining spaciousness, comfort
and style. In appearance and performance the new Dodge Brothers
Six is a gratifying surprise and a never-ending satisfaction.

THE WARNING.
Out of the stillness of the night came
a clear, vibrant sound. A youth emerged
from the shadow on the verandah, a girl
clinging to lam.
“Darling, I must go,” he said. “I must.”
MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANYTHING.
DOCTOR: “Congratulations, Professor, it’s a boy!”
ABSENTMINDED PROF.: “What is?”
“One more kiss,” she pleaded.
He clasped her to him.
Again that warning note—louder, more
insistent.
“Darling, it is anguish to leave you,” he
whispered, “but I have stayed too long.”
“Oh, Clarence! I may never see you again,
I may”
Again the trumpet call,
Matching his iron will against the misery
of parting, he tore himself away.
“flood-bye, my sweetheart,” he called.
“Good-bye! Good-bye! Heaven watch
over you!”
And now the blast rose strident, trium-
phant, as if glorying in the parting of two
young hearts. Coldly the moon looked down.
And still that sound rose cruelly on the
silent night air, causing blasphemy amongst
the neighbors. It was indeed a bugle note —
the snoring of Muriel’s father which invari-
ably reminded Claude that it was time to

“What about the

Minister, dejectedly.
“Beg pardon, sir,”
interposed one of the
twenty-five thousand
official secretaries, and
touched his forelock
humbly, as required by
the new regulations.
“Mr. Hughes left for
the seat of war
yesterday.”
“Thank Heaven!”
sighed Bruce as he
reached for his golf
sticks and bit the end
off a fresh Corona.
Presently a look of
pity flitted across his
face. “Poor cows!”
he muttered. “After
all, they’re mothers’
sons like the rest of
us.”
And then the old
ruthless expression re-
turned.
“I’m not sorry for
tliem, ’ he cried. “Not a scrap. It serves
’em bally well right for coming here and
disturbing everybody.”

THE ISSUE.
Beneath a spreading blue-gum tree the
agitator stands,
And his mighty lungs are roaring icith the
strength of two brass bands.
His followers are listening in the midday
heat intense;
The attitude of all of them bespeaks a cute
suspense.
They are there to solve a problem, which
alas! is far from clear;
They are anxiously debating if he’ll shout
them all a beer!

EHIND the Old Court label lies proof of
the faith which its distillers had in this
fine Australian spirit from the day it was first
placed upon the market.
Realising then that Old Court would in time
be the foremost brand of Whisky on the Aus-
tralian market, they backed their faith by storing
away vast stocks to mature in the wood, for the
benefit of users in the years to come.
And, from time to time, these reserves have
been supplemented so that never will the time
arrive when there will be a shortage of fully aged
supplies.
Thus to-day, when there are more bottles of
Old Court Whisky sold in Australia than of any
other single brand on the market, the man who orders
Old Court is assured of a whisky of wonderful mellow-
ness and age and all those qualities which make it
“The World’s Purest.”
BUT . . . with this wonderful success of Old Court,
it is timely that a warning be sounded. Old Court Whisky,
by reason of its great popularity, is receiving insincere
flattery in the form of doubtful imitation. An inferior
spirit is being offered as genuine Old Court.
Protect your palate and health with this knowledgeNo whisky
can be sold *as Old Court Whisky unless it is so labelled on the
bottle and unless both the capsule and cork bear the brand of
Federal Distilleries Pty. Ltd.
This warning is no reflection on the great majority of hotel-
keepers and proprietors of licensed stores; the distillers of Old
Court Whisky appreciate, as will their public, that no reputable
business house would willingly permit such unfair substitution.

Shadow Shows
It is an old platitude that the American
movie is standardising culture throughout
the universe. What Greta Garbo wore on
the screen last month will be worn next
month by flappers in Tokio, London and
Sydney. The new coiffure affected by Esther
Ralston will shortly be keeping the beauty
parlors busy in Ootacamund and Capetown.
"Power” (P.D.C.) introduces another aspect
of the subject. Its heroes are two young
men who are apparently ordinary navvies
employed on a big constructional job. But
when they knock off work they go to apart-
ments which would be regarded as luxurious
for a successful Australian doctor, and they
change into clothes that would have satisfied
Beau Brummcl. The impression given is
that the American toiler enjoys a standard
of living of quite extraordinary magnificence.
Whether this is so or not, the repetition of
the statement on the screen is likely to have
the same effect on his brother worker in
other lands as Greta Garbo’s gowns have on
the flapper. It may even have as much to
do with industrial unrest as the propaganda
of the Bolshevik. However that may be,
“Power” is an amusing-enough comedy, and
Jacqueline Logan, William Boyd and Alan
Hale keep the interest moving.
Of all the host of silent mimes the present
writer has surveyed, only two have impressed
him as having the understanding of
the pantomimic art in their very bones, and
one of them is Buster Keaton. In “Spite
Marriage” (M.-G.-M.) Buster is at his best.
As a pants-presser whom a Broadway star
marries in order to excite passionate envy
in a faithless beau, he moons through a
series of incidents which would be tedious
instead of funny were it not for the restraint
that rules his every move. Keaton never
wastes a gesture on the desert air. In
this film he knocks out six people with a
bottle, and every one is despatched in a new
and unexpected fashion. Plis intrusion into
a melodrama, where he takes the place of a
soldier privileged to kiss the heroine, is a
wildly amusing symphony of fun. There is
a kick left in the silent film, judging by
“Spite Marriage.”
“The Wheel of Life” (Paramount) is a
picture of English Army life in India
and the great American nasal impedi-
ESTHER RALSTON.
mcnt is as
much a sole-
cism in this
setting as it
can be an aid
to an Ameri-
can prize-ring
story such as
“The Man I
Lo v e.” The
story of “the
wheel” has
some dramatic
quality. A
man who saves
a girl from
killing herself
in London un-
ex pcctedly
meets her later
as the wife of
h i s elderly
c o 1 o n el in
India, and cir-
c u m s t a nces
continue so re-
lentlessly to
throw them at
each other’s heads that the young chap,
being a decent sort, leaves the regiment,
only to again meet his fate in a mountain
monastery, to the rescue of which duty
takes him, and to which the lady had gone
on a reckless sight-seeing expedition. In this
setting the ageing colonel (South Australian
0. P. Heggie) goes west conveniently, leav-
ing the young American Englishman (Dix)
and the young American Englishwoman
(Esther Ralston) free to take out the cus-
tomary license.
“Fazil” (Fox) is a pleasant surprise. It
contains a sheik, and sheik plays generally
make this Showman see red. The desert
chieftain usually wears his spurs upside
down and rescues the beautiful heroine from
a dust-storm only to imperil her virtue.
Then he turns out to be a French nobleman
in disguise, marries the lady and goes to
live in Paris. “Fazil,” however, is a genu-
ine study in miscegenation. The sheik goes
to Venice on a diplomatic mission, meets a
'.vhite girl and marries her. When she refuses
to stay in his apartment like a good Moham-
medan, he departs in anger to Arabia. There
he endeavors to forget his adventure in
monogamy by surrounding himself with a
large and quarrelsome harem. The white
girl follows him, and, the old spell being
renewed, he gets rid of his multitudinous
local encumbrance. But the lady finds
dual blessedness in a temperature of 102
degrees just as boring as he does, and when
she learns that he has surreptitiously taken
another bride she runs away from him. He
pursues her and gets fatally wounded. Her
love for him returns, and when he announces
that they will never again be parted she
accepts the statement in its mundane appli-
cation. However, the ring he has placed
on her finger is poisoned, and there is a
final close-up embrace which is unlike
Ofi previous ones surveyed by this .column
in that the two communicants are dying.
The acting is not quite up to the standard
of the story. Charles Farrell carries his
Arabian nobility with a somewhat self-con-
scious swagger, and Greta Nissen is too
sweet a person to throw her lot in with a
desert nomad. But there is good dramatic
stuff in the picture.
The Inky Way
From a New York correspondent:—
Kathleen Dalziel’s “Lest We Forget,’’ starred by
Tub Bulletin on the last anniversary of Anzac
Day, is having a tremendous vogue in America;
literajly hundreds of papers have printed it. Its
transplanting to this country began with the Literary
Digest’s reprinting of it on June 29; thereafter
it began to make a circuit of the country, usually
accompanied by comment in which Australia is
mentioned —for almost the first time in some of
the smaller papers.
On the same subject W. .1. Sanborn, a well-
known American critic, writes from Florida:
I wish to express to the Australian Bulletin
my deep appreciation of the poem “Lest We For-
get,” and my thanks to the writer, Kathleen Dalziel.
I should judge it to be the finest set of war-
anniversary verses written for 10 years past.
Even more striking is a letter from the
Central West —some place in lowa :
The Literary Digest, which we take, has printed
a poem “Lest We Forget” which has moved me
deeply. I read it—once—and there was moisture
about my old eyes; I read it again—more slowly.
Tears were in those eyes. I sat a moment, then
walked to the sitting-room where sat my white-
haired wife. I read it to her—tears trickled down
my cheeks. We—wife and I — know what it means.
Our two sons—all we had —went wearing the colors
of the U.S.A. Before that war was not unknown in
our family, who have stood in America’s battle lines
since 176(5. In our great war that abolished slavery—
-1861-6s—stood5 —stood my father, three nedes and myself
—I alone am left in these latter years. Then after
those years I had my slight share in the opening
of our Great West, from an Indian country to a
country that is to-day almost the heart of the
nation. These are said simply that you may know
that I understand. The walls of this library are
hung with the relics and the tools-of-war. But
there will be no more wars. Love and peace are
more beautiful as well as more profitable. A field of
lowing kine is a more pleasing sight than any field
of smoking guns; a stretch of land with grass and
fragrant flowers more uplifting than any expanse of
green sward with row upon row of little white
crosses. These are not the words of a sentimental
pacifist, but of an old soldier—the son of soldiers
and the father of soldiers. I stand before you,
uncovered and at salute, and I say deeply and
fervently— “l thank you for that poem!”
Lloyd Dumas, of the fine old news-
paper family from Mount Barker (S.A.), has
returned from London and taken up lus
duties as managing editor of the Adelaide
Advertiser. Langdon Bonython is still called
editor and Fred Robertson associate-editor, as
at any time for the last 40 years.
“Bargara” : A scoop as strange as any m
the history of newspapers was achieved
by one of the two daily papers in Bunda-
b'reg (Q.). The chief proprietor of th
News had been very ill for some time, and
his paper published daily, from a reporl
gained just before it went to press, a bulle-
tin concerning his condition. One morning it
came out with a “very low” announcement
whereas the Mail had an account of the
magnate’s death, with obituary and picture.
As he was about to leave for the night
the sub-editor of the Mail saw a cyclist
speeding to the near-by undertaker and recog
nised a relation of the News proprietor.
He made a guess. “Mr. gone?” he
called. “Yes, five minutes ago,” was the
reply as the cyclist sped on. The News
had made its final inquiry, and the family in
its grief had not thought to ring up the office.
The Palette"
Morris E. Cohen, a Melbourne amateur,
has been showing pastels at the Fine Arts.
The trouble about the pastel medium is that
it is difficult to cool the native exuberance
of chalk on canvas down to the scale _ol
natural values. Mr. Cohen’s world, which
includes Europe, M.L. and Australia, is as
bright and shining as if it had just come
out of the hands of a firm of cosmic house-
decorators. Nevertheless it is full of pleasmg
aspects.
A. E. Newbury’s annual rally at the
Athenaeum, Melbourne, contains work of
sincerity as well as of popular charm. The
sincerity reveals itself in a fairly pains
taking regard for tonal truth; the char a. to
a careful search for the picturesque. New-
bury has a habit of dropping into a faith-
fully rendered landscape some Corot-like
figures, and usually they look as if they
had arrived by natural means. His still-
lifes have a rich simplicity, which arrests
without doing violence to the eye.
No aboriginal- has ever before sat to such
an array of talent as assembled at the Vic.
National Gallery studios to record the
features of the two members of the Arunta
tribe whom George Aiston brought down for
the abo. art show. It included Mclnnes.
Benson, Herbert, Louis McCubbin and
Charles Wheeler. For two hours the natives
sat like ebon statues —and anybody who
has posed for even 20 minutes knows what
that means. In addition, Leason, Justus
Jorgensen and Colahan have made studies
of them, and the amateur cinema society
spent a Sunday morning loosing cameras on
their naked forms in a bit of secluded bush
near Eltham.
“F.S.”: The Rembrandt etchings, which
have turned up at the Sedon Galleries, Mel-
bourne, by arrangement with Colnaghi, Lon-
don, are immensely stimulating, showing as
they do the universality of the principles
governing great art. These travelling musi-
cians, rat-poison sellers, beggars and
negresses asleep—-how real they are ! How
vividly they stand before the onlooker! We
are back in Rembrandt’s world and breath-
ing the same air. And technically it is all
done by a faithful rendering of tonal values,
by a strict adherence to the limitations of
the bitten line, which grows ever more sensi-
tive and freer as the artist proceeds. We do
not know from these etchings what Rem-
brandt’s attitude was towards this prole-
tarian world of his—whether he was a
moralist or an epicurean, a socialist or a
conservative —and we don’t need to know r .
The figures speak for themselves, all the
clearer because the artist does not attempt
to speak for them. This show should be
seen by all interested in the etching art.

BREAKDOWN!
Kidney Trouble Causes Your Weakness
THIS FAMOUS FORTY-YEAR-OLD REMEDY HAS BROUGHT
HEALTH TO THOUSANDS—IT WILL SURELY BENEFIT YOU
If you are run-down, feeling worn-out, hating work, and with no zest for
pleasure, your strength just “giving out,” back aching, complexion sallow or
spotted; if you are having bad nights, it is practically certain that kidney
trouble is poisoning your system.
You may call your trouble rheumatism, lumbago, sciatica, chronic backache,
but it is no less certain that the kidneys are at the seat of all your ill-health.
It is the testimony of not one but thousands of one-time sufferers
which enables us to state that if you will commence a course with a
simple, straightforward remedy, De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills,
you will start again on the road to health. Under guarantee, we say
that if you will test this 40-year-old remedy, in 24 hours you will
see results.
Read this letter, just one of thousands
Mr ft. E. Deacon, 48 Locksley Avenue, Merrylands, Sydney, says:—“For nine
months I suffered with had backache. It was just as if a fork had been dug in
my back. I could not sleep with the pain. As for doing my cleaning, when
J got down on my knees I could hardly get up. The pain attacked me every-
v here. Wo one knows what I went through with my kidneys. I started taking
I)e Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills. They have done me the world, of good. I
get up better, fresher at five in the morning without pain. I blame myself for not
taking ‘jDe Witt’s’ before.’’
Why hesitate longer when such a wonderful offer of health is placed before
you? Why forego the pleasures of life? Why continue in constant nerve-
destroying pain? Why be weak and ailing, when you can, just by visiting
your nearest chemist, start once again building up full vim, vigor and vitality?
Your chemist knows how good this is
Do you know thousands of men and women have found that by
taking a course of treatment with De Witt’s Pills, they have enjoyed
a new lease of life? Women once crippled with pain, bed-ridden,
tell you that thanks to this simple inexpensive remedy they now
enjoy splendid vigor and vitality. Men old before their time have
regained new strength. This remedy, which sells by millions of
bottles the world over, acts directly on the kidneys so that they
purify the blood of all pain-giving poisons. Invaluable, too, in all
cases of Bladder Trouble. Why not ask your chemist about De
Witt’s Pills. He will tell you all about the splendid prescription
printed on the box, and why, if you purchase a 3/6 or 6/6 supply,
you will surely be on the road to splendid health.
For your own health’s sake do not accept any substitute for
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills.

Under the Whip
Mosstrooper followed in the footsteps of
Colonel Shilinski, Les Paddington, lioisel
and Sir Alogy by taking the Australian
Hurdle and Australian Steeple in the same
year. Punters accepted 2 to 1. about bus
Powell's chestnut, and were happily accurate
in their divination. Mosstrooper led through-
out. but it wasn’t such a runaway victory as
that recorded by Sir Alogy last year. At one
stage Epergue gave promise of being trouble-
some, and when lie threw up the sponge
Sea fit lodged a determined challenge. How-
ever, Bert Thompson had not attempted to
break the time record, and Mosstrooper
entered the home stretch with a lot of energy
in reserve. Thompson discovered the opposi-
tion of Seafit to be ineffective, and he
screwed round in the saddle several times to
see if danger threatened on the rails. All
was merry and bright there, and Moss-
trooper registered a leisurely win.
No doubt acting under orders, Alick Ful-
larton reversed the tactics which he employed
with Sandhurst in the Grand National
Steeplechase. Instead of tearing away id
front, he remained behind the leaders; but,
thus ridden, Sandhurst never appeared happy.
Passing the seven furlongs post for the
second time, he fell over Willanjie. The pace
was so moderate that Sandhurst would not
have been hampered by 12.7 had he been
mixing it with Mosstrooper; a freegoing
jumper loses zest when under restraint.
Thompson allowed Mosstrooper to take off
wherever he chose at fences, and the Kenil-
worth gelding gave a delightful exhibition
of jumping. Gus Powell maintains that had
the luck been equal Mosstrooper would have
vanquished Sandhurst in the Grand National.
Nineteen Victorian three-year-olds com-
peted in the Chatsworth Plate, with Sinetre
at the head of the weights, giving 71b. to
Gerald Buckley’s Woorak gelding Limber Up,
and the Great Star colt, Mithras. Duncan
piloted Limber Up, who firmed from 10 to 1
to 11 to 2. Though unplaced, Limber Up
shaped in a manner indicative of early ripen-
ing. Camargo, the favorite, w r as decisively
defeated by Melosus (7 to 1), belonging to
W. E. J. Craig, whom Royal Feast brought
into the limelight as an owner three seasons
ago. Camargo (Magpie—Maltine’sDaughter)
carries the livery of J. P. Arthur, original
owner of Fuji San.
Runners in the middle-distance Balaclava
Stakes included none of the fancied Cup
candidates. Sea Money, an Australian Cup
hero, became favorite at 3 to 1, but did
nothing to justify the honor. Will he ever
regain the autumn form of 1928 ? Affirm
snuffed out after trying to lead all the way.
A terrifically exciting finish ended in the
judge being unable to separate King s Con-
tort (5 to 1) and Hituchi (20 to 1), with
Laird o’ Cockpen only half a head farther
off. Onlookers thought Laird o’ Cockpen had
got home; he would have done so handled
to better advantage. Bill Burke, the owner-
trainer, ought to recover his Laird o Cock-
pen losses ere long.
Conjurer, brother to Poitrel, has been
acquired by a Maoriland sportsman _ and is
under orders for shipment, but was given an
outing in the Arkaringa Hurdle, and ended
up a slightly better favorite than Batalus.
He fell over Lanilda in the straight. Batalus
shaped badly, and Vanto (10 to 1) scored
handsomely from Not Infallible and Tirade.
Les Franklin, former crack flat-race rider,
could not prevent Teh Dien running out at
his fences in the Knowsley Steeple, and this
2-to-l favorite came a heavy cropper, enabling
Bligny (9 to 2) to win from Matang and
Bright Flare. Ringmen rejoiced when Ampli-
fier. a 14-to-l. pop, came with lightning
speed at the finish of the St. Aubin Welter
and wrested victory from Cyloon, from the
“pony” courses, who once belonged to Eric
Connolly.

Saturday’s weather brightened the faces of
farmers down in Sydney for their associa-
tion conference, but it depressed the spirits
of the “sports” who went out to Moorefield,
and everyone was relieved when that meeting
was over. Garrula (evens), withdrawn from
the principal flat race, for which he would
have been favorite, gave a poor exhibition
of jumping in the Hurdle Race, but scrambled
over somehow, and had too much pace for
the opposition on the flat. Prince Yerderer
(5 to 1) downed another even-money favo-
rite in Luita for the first division of the
Three- and Four-year-old Handicap, weight

hill after she had set up a long lead. The
second division gave Tindall his usual Satur-
day race, Urangarra, the colt of many sec-
onds, getting a first at last. Up for sale
during the week, Urangarra receded from
twos to fives, but a late commission brought
him to 7 to 2, and he won welh
A month ago this Page picked out Spear-
shot as a promising young horse whom it
would pay to follow. Equal favorite at 5 to

Spearsliot made an exhibition of his eight
opponents in time (2min. lOJsec.) which
was good considering that the track wjs a
morass. The stylish-looking and stoutly-
bred young gelding (he is by Spearhead-
Ramson) is owned by D. Bouffier and trained
at Mdorefield by Mackinnon. Unfortunately
he is not in the big spring handicaps. Ihe
stable captured another race, the second divi-
sion of the Flying Welter, with Beau Dennis

Maoriland racing men now in Australia

“Durdans”: The first serious trial of the
totalisator in England took place at the July
meeting at Newmarket. Though the machine
used was a slow and awkward variation of
the pari-mutuel, it proved a rousing success;
so much so that, after it had returned a
couple of good dividends, the ring opened
out in despair and laid odds never before
heard of in Merrie England. Factors in the
successful debut were provision for both
straight-out and place betting, as in Wcst-
ralia, and the small percentage deducted —-
6 per cent, as against nearly 14 per cent,
in N. S. Wales. Dividends are calculated
on a 2s. basis, and tickets for that amount
can be obtained in all parts of the course.
On its first appearance on a Scottish course,
at Catterick, the tote paid a dividend of
238 to 1. This has firmly established it in
the estimation of the Caledonians; in fact,
machine betting has come to stay in Britain.

Probably the worst infliction ever suffered
by a Stadium crowd was the Geo. '' mker
(13st. 61b.)-John Pesek (lost. 61b.) tvrest-
jing match at Melbourne on Saturday night.
As a wrestler George is either finished or
rise he never started. John’s efforts to make
the affair appear close resulted in the appli-
cation of the count from the exasperated
crowd as early as the second round. 1
lumbering Canuck’s only method ot attack
consisted in lowering his head and charging
in bovine fashion across the ring. ! esek
waited till the seventh round before he gained
the only fall.

None of Melbourne’s League games on
►Saturday amounted to a row of pins as tar
as the premiership went, and though the
Oollingwood-Geelong encounter drew idW
from the pockets of some 14,000 enthusiasts,
they mostly went to Victoria 1 ark to see
’Wood in action and Gordon Coventry luck
his hundredth goal for the season. He just
failed, reaching 99, two better than Ins pre-
vious record in ’27. As the team has five
more games to play, he should build a stifl
hill for succeeding goal-sneaks to climb.
’Wood ultimately won with 87 points to

was where it didn’t matter, m tbe gaine
between Essendon and Hawthorn on the

spirited finish and lost by only 8 pomts-
-92 to Essendon's 100. If Hawthorn had
battled thus earlier in the season it wouldn
be where it is now.

advertisement in N.S.W. The matter was
referred to the South Australians for then
consideration, and they have decided to
retain Adelaide as the venue. Gates will
be better, no doubt, but if the scope of the
game is to be extended the policy adopted
is a poor one.

“Rangi”: A rather remarkable football
happening is reported from Maoriland. In a
match between Opotiki and Rangitaiki an
attempt at a penalty goal saw the ball strike
one of the posts. Dropping on the horizontal
bar it then hopped gravely along until it
struck the other post, and fell off on the
touch side. There is an English record ol a
hall coming to rest in the middle of the
horizontal bar, and the decision which the
referee should have given is still a matter
for hot dispute in Rugby circles.

“Spare Sub.” : Sydney patrons of the sen-
sational press are in for a dubious tame.
For reasons best known to itself, the Rugby
League agreed to permit its players on tour
to write for newspapers, and there was a
rush to secure the services of touring liter-
ary experts. The result is that every daily
in Sydney with the exception of the • Herald
and the Labor Daily is now fitted with a
war correspondent on the North-of-England
front.

THE LITTLE INFRA-DIGGER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“In the Last round John Pesek (13st. 81l>.) and
Joe Zikmund (15st.. 81b.) came hurtling over the
ropes, the huge forms of the contestants smashing
on top of the diminutive Mr. Hughes. Attendants
ond ringsiders rushed to the rescue and hastily
hoisted the men from Mr. Hughes, while the larg
crowd roared with laughter. Old-timers declared
that never before has such wild hilarity been known
ot the Stadium.” —Sydney Sun.
They dragged him forth, wee William, from
under
An avalanche of animated meat;
They prised the struggling, sweating pair
asunder
To pull a history-maker to his feet,
Dazed, slightly winded, too, I sliouldn t
wonder,
Ruffled a lot and buffeted a treat.
They salvaged him, and the unfeeling crowd
Acclaimed the turn with laughter long anti
loud.
Squeezes lie’s had a-many since liis enti y
Long years ago upon the public stage;
Few have known tighter places Parliament ry
Or closer calls than Billy, I’ll engage.
But to be woodened out by wrestling gentry
Was worse than being downed by Bruce
and Page.
He can hit back at them, but he had no
Such means of getting home on John and Jpe.
What use the most incisive, stinging phrases,
The metaphors so pungent, apt and fresh,
The fertile comminution that amazes,
When ’neath such weight as this you groan
and thresh V , ,
What use to relegate to blithering blazes
Some thirty stone of greasy, squirming
flesh . . „
That threatens you with suffocating death .
I'll bet he did, though, if he had the breath.
There might have been a Privy Councilor
freighted
Across the Styx, a crushed-to-pulp K.L.,
An ex-Prime Minister eliminated
To finish oil' a Stadium jamboree.
Ah ! Let us thank high Heav n he wasn t
fated
For such a squalid end as that would bo.
From under Joe and John in battle blent

Rain ruined the Rugby Union fixtures in
Sydney on Saturday, though the clubs which
adapted their play to the conditions scored
deserved successes. Outstanding was the
defeat of the brilliant Randwick team by
Northern Suburbs, which has fairly come
into its own this season. In spite of the
slippery ground and greasy ball at the
Cricket Ground, Randwick persisted in try-
ing to open up the game. Relying on their
forwards, the Northerners won by a try and
a penalty goal to a try. Pick Rang played
a great forward game for North, while West-
held faced a lot of tough work as Randwick’s
full back. Western Suburbs beat University
at St. Luke’s, (i-O, forwards again carrying
the day. St. George scored its second win
of the season at the expense of Manly, 8-0;
Police also bagged a brace, the second
victim being Glebe-Balmain, G-3.
* ❖ * *
At Melbourne Exhibition Oval on Satur-
day, a Victorian Rugby Union team won
handsomely from a N.S.W. side by 16 to
9 (4 tries and 2 goals to 3 tries). The game
was fast and clever, but the attendance was
disappointing, being under 1000. Marchand,
a new threequarter from England, made a
great impression with Victoria, while Ken-
nedy, the young Uni. winger, was the star
back of the visitors.
* * * *
“Stand Off”: The N.S.W. Rugby Union
is winding up the season by sending a
team across to Perth. The Union game has
now been going in the West for three sea-
sons; there are six first-grade, four reserve-
grade and a number of junior teams play-
ing. The following includes many Maori-
landers and South Africans. All players
able to make the long trip are asked to get
in touch with the N.S.W. Union, which
might do worse than include young men
from Victoria and Queensland in the side.
$ * * *
James Baxter, past president of the Eng-
lish Rugby Union and an English selector,
has been appointed manager of the British
side to tour M.L. and Australia next season.
A great fighter for Dominion interests on
the international board, he has always been
a strong opponent of the Scottish doctrine
of exclusiveness, and but for him and his
supporters there might have been no All
Black and Waratah tours. An old inter-
national forward, he is also a first-rate
golfer and a noted yachtsman, so his visit
to Sydney should specially appeal to him.
* * * *
“Drop Kick” : It looks as if the Australian
Rugby Union will have to find a new half-
back, that great little scrum-worker Syd
.Malcolm having sustained an injury which
will probably keep him out of the game.
This is a dislocated shoulder, which began
in England and has been recurring at
intervals. Most athletes know that when
the joint has developed the habit of get-
ting out of its socket it is almost im-
possible to establish immunity from a repeti-
tion. With the British side here next year,
there is a great opening for a new half.
No one in sight at present, save Lamport
of Sydney Uni., perhaps, is quite in Mal-
colm’s class.
* * * *
Sydney Rugby League players fared no
better than their Union.rivals in the matter
of bad playing conditions. Western Suburbs
made a bold bid to down South Sydney at
the Sports Ground, but the premiers emerged
winners by 10-6, a last-minute try and goal
saving them. Craig put up a great game for
the losers and scored the th.ree goals which
made up West’s points. Balmain, well
suited by the mud, downed North Sydney at
Birchgrove by 14 to 11, while at Marrick-
ville Newtown put University down another
peg, the scores being 11-8. Another narrow
margin separated St. George and Glebe at
Arncliffe, the Saints getting home by a
point (ir.-14), after Glebe had led 14-10
late in the game, thanks to hard forward
play. South Sydney is now assured or the
minor premiership, with the right of chal-
lenge if beateni in the major event.
* :[t *
“Gate”: The N.S.W. Rugby League has
fallen on evil days; so evil in truth that
the section of the daily press which once
ate out of its hand is actually talking back
at it. The latest trouble concerns two young
gentlemen of some eminence in Sydney foot-
ball who were secretly conveyed to the coun-
try and “rung in” in an important match
between two bucolic centres. This was dis-
covered and reported, and the League, on
being assured by the two players that they
had no idea what they were doing, decided
to let them both go with a caution, while
the country League which _ hired them
was asked to show cause why it should not
be disqualified. In reply it invited the met-
ropolitan body to get work, and its example
was followed by another. Also, a query
addressed by the League to the metropolitan
club employing the two offending players
was met with the curt ..intimation that the
central “authority” had better watch its
step. Now the once-faithful press is asking
why it doesn’t buck up and be a man, and
the League’s cup of bitterness is slopping
ovgr.
* *
“Swing th’ Boot”: It is evident that the
N.S.W. Rugby League- is getting ready to
throw its discredited old cobber the Queens-
land R.L. to the demnition bow-wows. Lhe
Brisbane R.L. seems to have gained complete
control of the situation in Queensland, and,
of course, the Sydney body is getting ready
to side with the bigger battalions. The
matter had to be approached politely, so the
Q.R.L. was asked to settle its difference with
the revolting body. The only reply was an
acknowledgment of the letter, and Noo Sowth
now feels justified in any action deemed
desirable.
* * *
“Old Q.”: Adavale, a pastoral hamlet in
south-w 7 est Queensland, has lately had the
usual experience of Rugby League .football.
According" to the local journal, a side from
Quilpie visited Adavale and defeated the
locals. Punching was general, and matters
came to a head when a Quilpie man fast-
ened his teeth in an Adavale gladiator s
throat. No wonder, as the report concludes,
“the Quilpiei players mounted their motor-
lorry and departed hurriedly without even
waiting to change their clothes.”
Racquet and Bawl
America regained the Wightman Cup at
Forest Hills, New York, by 4 matches to
three. The feature of the match was the
close go which English Betty Nutliall gave
Helen Wills, the w-orld’s championette only
winning 8-6, 8-6. Mrs. Watson, of England,
also downed Helen Jacobs, America s second
string, in two sets of singles, and with Mrs.
Mitchell won the only doubles event from
Misses Wills and Cross.
* * * *
“Top Spin”: The Sydney tennis team
which has been touring the north of N.S.W.
has come back much impressed with the
form of some of the country players. So good
a judge as Frank Peach considers that Guy
Williams, of Barrabra, has strong claims for
Davis Cup recognition. Williams has been
conspicuous in country matches for some sea-
sons, but, like most extra-metropolitan players
gets little first-class tennis.
* * * *
“John B.”: When the Waller a wang
(N.S.W.) town tennis club went to Cullen
Builen to settle an argument the other
day—each had a win to ils credit —it struck
a problem which could not bo solved. A
tally after the game showed that both teams
had won 8 sets 79 games! , They called it a
draw, and adjourned for drinks.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: The advent of the
oliicial tennis season, which opens this week
with the N.S.W.-Qtteensland matches in
Brisbane, again revives the query as to when
the Australian tenuis authorities, and especi-
ally those of N.S.W., are going to fall into
line with the British, American and Con-
tinental associations in the matter of a clear
definition of professionalism. As one tennis
authority put it bluntly in the press the
other day, if real amateurism were enforced
here few officials and leading players would
retain their amateur status. For instance, no
attempt has been made by the N.S.W. body—
or any other for that matter —to restrain so-
called amateurs from carrying on business m
connection with the sale_ of tennis and other
sporting requisites. This is an act of pro-
fessionalism everywhere but in Australia, as
it is in golf. Why it is glossed over only
those responsible know.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Ilotham” : The Maoriland golfing contin-
gent now in Australia made a good begin-
ning in the contest for the Victorian
amateur title; Sloan Morpeth collected the
bacon by 2 and 1 from A. Hancock. The
Victorian made a gallant fight of it, but
let himself down on the greens. Morpeth
came from the Dominion with a reputation
as a long hitter, but in this match he
showed that he was deadly with the putter
as well.
# * * *
Legh Winser, South Australian representa-
tive cricketer and golfer, again annexed the
amateur championship of the A\ heat State on
Saturday, downing A. D. Dye in the final at
Ivooyoonga by 1 up. It must have been a
good go, for they were square at the end ot
the first round. Winser last won in 1925.
si: si: * *
“Bertha Brassey”: Competitors in the
N.S.W. women’s championship meeting at
Kose Bay had an unusual experience, for,
owing to the 'heavy entry, the late players
had to finish in the light of the new moon.
It was fortunate that only associates were
concerned. If it had been a competition tor
males, a lot of cards would have been torn
up as the moving finger of the clubhouse
clock approached the fatal hour of p.m.
“Glenelg”: The Australian open golf
championship on the Seaton course at Adel-
aide at the end of the month promises to
be a hard-fought battle, for the entry is
one of the strongest yet recorded. The
holder, Fred Popplewell, from N.S.W., will
defend his title, and in Rufus Stewart, the
1928 champion, and Fergus Macmahon will
have two formidable brother-professionals
to face, both familiar with the course. The
Victorians will be led by Ivo Whitton,
while faraway Queensland has sent two
representatives in Arthur- Gazzard, the
Queensland open champion, and Dick Carr,
who competed in the event in South Aus-
tralia four years ago. Sloan Morpeth, win-
ner of the Victorian amateur title, will
appear for Maoriland in addition to the
professional detachment from the Shivery
Isles.
* * * *
“The McHaggis”: Something like con-
sternation overtook N.S.W. golfers at the
collapse of their players in the Victorian
championships, all the Cornstalk cracks save
one —and he is an exiled Victorian —falling
down badly in the qualifying rounds. The
real cause of the trouble —it is nothing
new—is that Hip Victorian championship
courses, particularly the Commonwealth, on
which the present championships were
played, call for much more accurate golr!
than either the Royal Sydney or the Aus-
tralian Club course in Sydney. Conditions
are too easy altogether by the Harbor, and
when the men accustomed to them come up
against something really stilt they arc; like
Scotsmen out of whisky, so to speak.
:|: J': *!•
“Divot Digger”: After months of backing
and filling, the Australian Golf Council has
collected its wits sufficiently to announce
that there will be no visit by a British team
this year, at least. Some time ago it was
confidently asserted that the tour was a
certainty, and the names of the players were
published. Now it appears that everyone in-
vited has sidestepped. No reasons are given.
Perhaps the stories of the ball-stealing crows
have leaked through—they would certainly
have their effect on Scottish players. Another
deterrent influence might have been the
notorious fact that W. M. Hughes is now a
hopeless golf addict. They still remember
him in Britain.
* * * *
“Hermit Park” : Old rivals clashed when
Townsville and Charters Towers met recently
in the golf battle for the Tyack Cup, the
star event of its kind in N.Q. Point is added
to the meeting by the long-standing argument,
between the two cities as to which was
responsible for the first golf club ever heard
of in Queensland. Both made a start early
in the 1890’s and both efforts came to an
untimely end, though they were revived later,
and have continued with great success. The
reason for the demise of the early clubs is
not quite clear to Hie multitude, but to all
those with a knowledge of N.Q. in those
days it is evident that the lack of that back-
bone of golf, the 10th Hole, was responsible
for the failure in each case. That has long
been remedied, and both clubs are flourishing.
Sjc sj; ❖
“Woolloongabba”: One of those journals
which collect their golf news with scissorS
has published some details of children of
famous golfers who have received baptismal
names commemorating the success of their
parents on one golf course or another. Miss
Hoylake Massey, married recently in Scot-
land, is a case in point, the name of the
famous Royal Liverpool course having been
tacked on to her because poppa won the
British Open there the day she was born.
I hate to think the fashion may spread to
Australia, and especially to my native State
of Queensland. Imagination shudders at the
thought of a Miss Yeerongpilly Bunker or
an Egbert Sandy Gallop Mashy.
* Sf * *
“Baffy” : Golf as it is played in Australia
is popularly supposed to lie within the pro-
vince of gentlemen to whom two bob is
neither here nor there. Yet the proposal
launched by W. A. Windeyer for a 2s. levy
on each he-golfer belonging to a N.S.W. club
has met with the strongest opposition. It is
recapitulating to say that the levy is to form
a central fund, such as that which has
proved such a success in Maoriland, to pay
the expenses of touring golf teams and send
professionals to coach country players.
Curiously enough, the fiercest opposition to
the plan has come from some of the country
clubs.
By beating Victoria 10-1 on Saturday in
the closing round of the Australian base-
ball carnival in Sydney, N.S.W. retained
the championship. N.S.W. was leading 3-0
against South Australia, when rain com-
pelled abandonment of the match, South
Australia taking second place in the series.

Car and Cycle
“Whizz”: Kaye Don, the English racing
motorist, narrowly escaped the predestined
end of speed drivers —at least, those who do
not retire while the going is good—while
giving an exhibition before a holiday crowd
at Brooklands. He was at the wheel of
a Sunbeam car, and had reached a speed of
135 m.p.h., on a track which is only designed
to permit 120, when an oil-pipe burst. The
hot oil sprayed on his face, and only his
goggles saved him from being blinded. llow-
ever, he completed the run, averaging 134.24
m.p.h., and breaking his own previous best
for the track by 1.78 m.p.h.
* * * *
“Garry”; Despite the increasing tendency
of American and Continental designers to
equip sporting and racing cars with motors
of eight cylinders or more—the latest Bugatti
has 16 —the six-cylinder type still has influen-
tial supporters. The Rolls-Royce firm, which
has been experimenting for over a year with
a sporting mode], designed, apparently, to
compete with such high-powered cars as the
Isotta-Fraschiui and llispano-Suiza, recently
disclosed that it has perfected the motor —■
a six-cylinder engine of comparatively small
size and weight, but capable of delivering
well over 100 h.p. at full throttle. While
engines with, more cylinders than six have
certain advantages in the way of smoothness
of running, quietness and flexibility, their
superiority as speed-producers has not yet
been conclusively demonstrated. When the
new Rolls-Royce gets on the tracks it" will
be possible to make some interesting com-
parisons.
* * * *
“Kick Starter” : People who have had to
scurry for their lives to get out of the way
of motor-cyclists in Militafy-road, North
Sydney, will read with mingled feelings of
the achievement of one G. Vallance. In a
quarter-mile road race, staged by the South
Sydney Club, the young man cut out the
distance in 9sec., just over 100 m.p.h. The
time was officially taken and checked, and
the run is claimed as the first at a three-
figure rate which has been recorded by a
motor-cycle on Australian roads. The
machine was a 3|-h.p. 0.V.11. Norton.
* •*;! * He
“Sprocket”: Lamb has won two more races
in the elimination tests for the U.S. profes-
sional cycling championship, *the distances
being 30 and 40 miles. The Victorian lias
been offered profitable contracts in America,
but may possibly cross the herring-pond for
the Tour dc France. Provided he could fit
in with a good team, he would probably do
well in the French race, but Opperman’s
experience last year showed that a lone-haud
venture is hopeless.
“N.”: Hubert Opperman has been granted
another record by the Vic. cycling authori-
ties—loo miles, unpaced, in 4hr. 22min. 9sec.
, Little Jimmy Harrington, of Melbourne, is
going to have a shot at Opperman’s figures.

“Roller”: A patient young man is E.
Wadsworth, who left Perth in January with
designs on Francis Birtles’s long-distance
cycling record of 8200 miles in Australia.
Wadsworth was reported at Mt. Gambier
(S.A.) the other day, when he had completed
5545 miles; he aims at covering 11,000 miles
within 12 months, and so far has not even
had a puncture. His machine is equipped
with wireless, the total weight being 1051 b.,
and he is working his passage as he goes, his
sole funds at starting being £l.
Miscellaneous
“Susie Shinguard”: My dear wait till
I tell you we are all in a perfect twitter at
■ the idea of us girls really and truly sending
a hockey team of our very own, my pet,
to South Africa. Just think of it. We had a
proper carnival all by our own selves over
in Perth to decide on who should go and
beard the lions and the sheiks in their den,
if you know what I mean, though Flossie
Floppyns, who is a high-school teacher and
the most awful frump though she pretends
to know everything except how to play
hockey, says the creatures are only to be
found at. the other end of the country.
Anyway, it looks a duck of a place on the
map all colored pink and I hear there are
lots of places where one can get a bracer
and all that sort of thing, so it can’t be so
slow, anyway not as bad as Melbourne I’m
sure. That reminds me, we’re all having
a lovely time raising money to pay the ex-
penses, so get out the jolly old cheque-book,
old dear, and make out a fat one payable
to the sec. as quick as you like.

“Bermuda”: Though the “21” class has
only been in vogue among Australian yachts-
men for a few- years, the Forster Cup now
attracts more attention than any other yaeht-
racipg event. The next contest is set down
for Melbourne in January. The big Sydney
clubs have joined forces in raising a fund
to build three new craft for the event; over
£lOOO has come to hand and work on two
boats has begun.

“Aigburth”: Indoor cricket in the off
season, or in wet weather, is all the rage
in England, and proprietors of practice
schools are drawing fat dividends. Hendren
has one of the most popular. The pitches
are of wood, covered with felt, with matting
above that; there is brilliant electric light-
ing, and white canvas sight screens are
behind the bowlers. The wickets are cur-
tained off from each other by canvas screens,
while there is a bar and a lounge to round
off this ideal resort. Patsy charges Bs. an
hour for his ten wickets, which are occupied
all day long. This probably accounts for
the fees he asks from overseas cricket
bodies desiidng to engage him as a coach.
# * * *
“Hamer”: What is likely to be most in
dispute about the late Syd Gregory is
how much he received from the subscription
taken up when he made his famous 201
against Stoddart’s team on the S.C.G. An
old hand says the pound-a-run idea was
started by a wealthy enthusiast who promptly
put in his cheque for the full amount; it is
certain that the hat was passed round in the
members’ stand and the grandstand also.
Syd told me himself that the amount was
£350, “but,” he added, “a few of the soys,
may have fallen on the counter.”
* * *
“Shrewsbury”: West Indian Constantine
is no doubt doing well in Lancashire League
cricket (B. 31/7/’29), but Australian Arthur
Richardson is also in the limelight. Accord-
ing to recent advices the South Australian
lias been having a gradely time with Bacup.
During Whit week he scored 74, 112 and 136
n.o. in three matches. He had made more
runs than any other League batsman, his
total being 460 and average 51, while his
25 wickets had cost 17 runs apiece.
* * * *
“Spare Sub” : The player-writer continues
to pile up trouble, the latest to in the
bouillon being Ponsford’s old friend Lar-
wood. The Notts speed merchant wrote
words of high disdain about Yorkshire, and
the Tykes, not prone to take that sort of
thing lying down, protested to the Notts
committee. Larwood has been ordered to
apologise, and to cease from troubling in
future.

“Old Q.”: In September the Australian
Board of Control is to meet to name the
manager, treasurer and selectors for the
next Australian eleven for England. There
is a strong feeling in Queensland that Leo
O'Connor is the man for the treasurer’s job.
O’Connor is a qualified accountant, is orie
of the soundest opening batsmen in Australia,
and is in the first flight of wicket-keepers.
His appointment would give the selectors a
chance to include an extra bowler.
H. H. STERLING, member of the execu-
tive committee of the Maoriland Rugby
Union, who visited Australia with the
All Blacks. In his lighter moments he
is general manager of the M.L. Rail-
ways.
“Hotham”: The Victorian athletic autho-
rities have been disappointed in their hope
of getting the famous Canadian sprinter
Percy Williams to extend his Ma&riland tour
and show in Melbourne. He was unable to
come over before the middle of March, and
by that time the track season will be over.
However, America is to be asked to send a
first-class all-round team next season to tour
Australia.
* * * *
“Tapes”: The Empire Games are definitely
to be held at Hamilton in Canada next
summer, and are to extend over a week.
Hamilton municipality is assuming the entire
financial burden; this will include the out-
lay of £29,000 on a swimming pool and
the increase of seating accommodation in
the existing sports stadium by 10,000 seats.
Boxing, swimming, rowing and the usual
programme of track athletics will be served
up, and it is hoped to include Rugby and
Soccer football. The English A.A.A. has
promised a Number 1 team, but it is rather
too much to expect the casual Australian
athletic bodies to do anything, though the
Rugby Union might send a side if a clash
with the English fixtures could be avoided.
The most cheering news from an Australian
point of view is that the local Olympic
Council is prevented by its constitution from
taking a hand in the proceedings.
* * * *
“Fade Away” : Touching the comment on
baseball by “Third Base” (B. 24/7/’29), it
is worth noting that an American team will
A. FULLERTON, the Melbourne jockey
who rode Sandhurst to victory in the
Grand National Steeple in his first
season over the sticks.
be invited to Australia each year in future,
while it is possible that a couple of the big
professional teams, probably the Yankees
and the White Sox, may visit this country
on an' exhibition tour, like that staged by
the Giants and the Sox just before the.war.
The visit of Stanford Uni. last year has
given the game tremendous impetus, and it
is only a matter of time for it to take its
place with the leading games in this country.
* * * *
“Bumpk”: There was a quaint spectacle
on a grassy spot in Geelong the other day.
P. Pratt, the managing director of the Air-
craft Manufacturing Supply Co., got into a
machine resembling an aeroplane but minus
an engine. The object was tied to the back
of a motor-car by a long rope and towed
furiously across the ground. Several times
it floated up into the air, like a kite being
dragged along by a small boy, while members
of the newly-formed Gliding Club looked
on. The test was considered satisfactory,
and the new pastime is expected to catch
on. Geelong is an unexpected site for the
first organisation of the kind, as it is not par-
ticularly hilly, though if members can get
their machines to the top of the You Yangs,
a range about 20 miles inland,' they should
be able to float home.
* * *
“Pot th’ White”: Willie Smith’s break
of 2030 in his match against Maorilauder
McConachy in Sydney is easily an Austra-
lian record, though lie has bettered it in
England with 2743. Walter Lindrum’s 1954
made in Melbourne early in the year is the
best by an Australian player under the
present rules. _ George Gray made 2196 with
his red loser in 1911, while another special-
ist, W. J. Peall, for years a rival of John
Roberts, once totted up 3304, mostly from
the long-barred spot stroke. Tom Reece
tops the market with 499,135 unfinished,
made by jamming the two object balls in
the jaws of a pocket and carrying on with
cannons till even he had had enough.
* * * *
“Ludo”: Things went with more than a
swing at the polo carnival up Quirindi
(N.S.W.) way. Several were injured, and
they weren’t all riders. In the first match
Uralla v. Wirrigullas G. B. Waller had a
collision, and his head got in the way. Later
a pony galloped into the onlookers, and, two
being knocked insensible, the unconscious
tallied three. Finally an Indian visitor had
his face carved by a flying stirrup-iron. There
may be truth in the rumor that the district
is staging a Baek-to-Marbles Week.
* * * *
“Lignum Vitas”: The visit of a Canadian
bowling team during the coming season has
been definitely settled; the first contingent
will leave from Eastern Canada on Decem-
ber 6, Westerners following a week later.
The team will tackle Maoriland first, spend-
ing about six weeks in the Dominion, and
then coming on here to meet most of the
States and play the inevitable Tests. Not
much is known of Canadian form, but the
Maorilanders should prove excellent trial
horses.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Chevroford”: The increasing luxury of
motor-cars is having its effect on the trams.
A vehicle shortly to emerge from the Prestou
(Vic.) workshops will present to the
delighted gaze of tram-users individual seats
upholstered in leather or moquette. Soft,
shaded lights will give even illumination and
help in the illusion that the traveller is get-
ting something de luxe, even if he has to
: stand.
❖ * * *
“Whitehaven” : One of the things in which
Britain is supreme is the making of oil-
tankers. The Armstrong, Whitworth Co. is
constructing an 8800-tonner, fitted with six-
cylinder Armstrong-Sulzer two-stroke Diesel
engines, for the Norwegians. It will be the
165th Armstrong-Wliitworth oil-tanker.
* * * *
“0. W. Waireki”: “Pabcllco” mentions
(B. 3/7/’29) that M.L.’s Postal Depart-
ment sells advertising space on stamp-
edging. This applies only to stamps sold in
2s. booklets. There are 18 penny and 12
halfpenny stamps in these handy booklets;
besides advertisements on the gummed edging,
pages are sandwiched between the sheets of
six stamps.
* * * #
“Dinde”: Not much is heard of the
export trade in turkeys, but it is growing
fast. Sydney handles most of it; the birds
are killed and dressed on this side and sent
to the TJ.S.A., in cold storage. There is a
strong demand, especially at Christmas and
Thanksgiving, when a turkey menu is de
rigueur. Birds are then retailed at up to
ss. per lb.

“C.Q.”: An Australian invention is getting
a thorough trial in the Swiftpool, the first
steamship designed exclusively to be driven
by pulverised fuel. She is 9000 tons burden,
with a length of 412 feet. The method and
machinery for. breaking down the slack coal
into a powder, which is sprayed into the
combustion chambers as easily as if it were
liquid oil, are due to Engineer-Commander
Brand, who resigned from the R.A.N. to
bring his notion before the British shipping
world.

“John E.”; I earn my crust by lumping
160-pound bags of raw sugar at a North
Queensland port. All winter I help to load
’em into ships going south to the refineries,
and between times 1 help to unload the
refined product out of ships coming north
from the refineries. Something radically
wrong there. In effect, ' a bag of sugar is
stacked at a mill, loaded into a truck, un-
loaded and stacked on a wharf, loaded into
a ship (sometimes into a lighter, and thence
into a ship, as at Mackay), unloaded in the
South, stacked again, loaded and refined;
and then through the same little jig back to
the North for consumption. It’s a wonder
there’s any sugar left, after ail that wear
and tear.

“Prisms” :• The outlook for the _ N.S.W.
fruitgrower has greatly improved since the
N.S.W. railways, following Clapp’s example
in Vic., took to retailing high-quality grapes
and oranges at fair prices. Now prunes from
the Murrumbidgee irrigation area are to be
sold in handy cartons —a pound for nine-
pence. In 1927-28 Australia • imported
1.6 (9,4851 b. of U.S. prunes, valued at
£27,260, N.S.W.’s share being 921.4791 b. We
even sent to Iraq and China for prunes,
though our own Diggers grow them in
abundance.
* * * *
“Ex-Grocer”: A Sydney feminist advises
buyers of “cut” goods at delicatessen
shops and the like to insist, when they
ask for a pound of anything, on being
given that pound exactly, extra ounces
being the trader’s subtle mode of profiteer-
ing. It is very foolish advice. A trader is
naturally honest because honesty pays, but
when it comes to diamond-cut-diamond he
controls the turn of the scale. It is virtually
an impossibility to cut exact weights, and
only a fool would expect the vendor to give
away the “overs” every time. If buyers
start a campaign against paying for “overs
they will find “shorts” their regular lot.
* * * *
“Bill Ding”: Touching hardwood sleepers
(B. 24/7/’29), those used in India of late
years have invariably been jarrah, 9ft. x
lOin. x sin., 16 to the load ; award rate, 48s.
9d. per load. The Westralian cutter does
not pay royalty or carting. Once his 3s.
sleeper leaves the stump there are charges
for turning, inspection, cartage, loading on
trucks, railage to port, wharfage, workmens
compensation, insurance, freight to Indian
ports, unloading on to trucks and railage
to depots. When these obligations have been
met the margin for rake-off looks thin even
if the Indian price is 11s. 6d. But as a
hardwood sleeper’s life is only 2(3 to _ -•»
years, the Indian railways consider it wiser
to buy steel sleepers at. 13s. 6d. and be sure
of 30 to 35 years’ service. Hence the dulness
of the hewers’ occupation in Australia.


Motor Fuels
Tested
Remarkable Demonstration
given at Oil Company’s
Laboratory
A Convincing Test
Anybody who goes to the
Yarraville Installation of
the Vacuum Oil Company
Pty. Ltd., and sees there the
Midgley Bouncing Pin apparatus
testing fuels, must be convinced
that there is only one spirit on
the market that is outstandingly
better than others; and that is
appotenic Plume.
This apparatus—the only equip-
ment of the kind in the South-
ern Hemisphere—proves in deeds,
to the eye and ear, what the
appotenic Plume advertising
claims in words. It shows clearly
those invisible and sometimes in-
audible laborings that take place
beneath the bonnet of a car when
it is travelling up hill, or under
heavy load, on the wrong kind
of fuel, on fuel unstable to heat
and high compressions. It shows
the advantages of the ritjht kind.
Details of the Apparatus
The Midgley Bouncing Pin Set con-
sists of a small internal-combustion
engine; a direct-coupled electric gene-
rator; a thermostatic cooling system;
an instrument and control board; and
—the bouncing pin apparatus itself.
The engine, which is water-jacketed,
is firmly fixed on a solid base. A
special head has been fitted, which is
designed not only to admit the bounc-
ing pin—of which more details later
but to give the high compression of 6.7
to 1. Average compressions obtaining
in present-day cars are as follows: —
American .. • • 4.9 to 1
English .. .. 5.2 to 1
Continental .. . • 5.4 to 1
So it can be seen that any motor spirit
that stands up to the conditions exist-
ing in this trial engine will not break
down in any car in the world that is
not a freak car.
The fuel is further “burdened” by a
magnetic resistance or load which is
placed on the engine through the gen-
erator, and which can be varied by the
operator by means of a control on the
instrument-board; while the spark set-
ting is on much more than a normal
“advance.”
The Measurement of Knocks
Now for the measurement and the
comparison of knocks. This is the
purpose of the bouncing pin.
In a tapped orifice in the combustion
head, similar to a spark-plug hole, is
screwed a drilled steel rod about seven
inches in length. Through the centre
of the rod, fitting closely, but free to
move, goes the “pin” itself. The lower
end of the pin rests on a small dia-
phragm, which is held in position by
a hollow ring nut screwed against a
shoulder in the surrounding metal.
This diaphragm takes the pressure that
is generated in the combustion chamber
during the firing stroke. While it holds
the compression, it transmits any shock
or vibration (when knocking is taking
place) to the pin above it, which is
thus caused to “bounce.”
The upper end of the pin, while at
rest, touches the lower arm of a pair of
contact-breakers. These are normally
open, and are positioned in an electric
circuit which operates a red light and
a “knock-measuring” device on the
instrument board.
When a Knock Occurs
When a knock occurs in the engine,
the diaphragm is “sprung”; the pin
bounces ; taps the contact-arms to-
gether, closes the circuit, the red light
flickers, and the knock-indicator works.
The “knock-measuring” device con-
sists of a calibrated glass tube filled
with an acid solution, through which
the same electric current that operates
;the light passes. The passage of the
current releases a gas in the solution,
which rises in the form of bubbles to
the top of the tube. This renders com-
parisons between the knock-frequency
of two different fuels very simple. The
more gas that is collected over a given
period of running, the worse, from the
knocking point of view, is a fuel —the
less, the better.
More than Human
Those who have seen tests realised
fully for the first time the big differ-
ence between various brands of motor
spirits that ordinary running in a car
does not always reveal —but which is
bound to be recorded in ultimate per-
formance, i.e., in more, or less, gear
changing or in more, or less, miles per
gallon.
The Midgley Bouncing Pin Apparatus
is more than human. . It hears what
ears cannot hear, feels what is imper-
ceptible to the human touch. It proves
very definitely the reason for that
seemingly paradoxical term the “silent
knock” ; and convincingly demonstrates
the value to the motorist of using a
motor spirit that possesses the “appo-
tenic” quality which, by controlling
the rate at which Plume burns, elimin-
ates all kinds of knocking and ensures
maximum power output.
Engineers who have witnessed tests
acknowledge that this inherent appo-
tenie quality places Plume in a class
by itself —a genuine knock-proof motor
spirit of incomparable quality.

The Midgley Bouncing Pin knock-testing set is recognised through-

determining the anti-knock value of a fuel*
The set illustrated above forms part of the extensive fuel-testing
equipment in the laboratory of the Vacuum Oil Company Pty. Ltd.
By this scientific apparatus the remarkable anti-knock quality of
Plume .is regularly tested and confirmed.
If motor spirit tested in
this device has a tendency to
knock, the bouncing pin will
detect it even although it be
inaudible to the human ear.
Even the slightest disruption
or increase in the burning
rate of the fuel is indicated
by a tell-tale sign on the
instrument board. There is
no indication of even a silent

Optimists who deposited topcoats in the
cloak-rooms on arriving at Caulfield on
Saturday soon realised that the sunlight,
like Sandhurst, was no stayer; the wind was
as chilly as any yet experienced at the Heath
during the winter. Mosstrooper’s steeple-
chase win was very popular, the rider,
Thompson, receiving plaudits that would
have brought joy to the heart of a matinee
idol. Here and there feminine attire gave a
hint that spring is coming, though the fur
coat that had a good roll collar was favored.
A pleated navy-blue skirt allied to a sports
coat of the same colored velvet, a floral silk
blouse and a smart straw hat swathed in
some Oriental brocade was one turnout that
suggested the brighter days ahead. Some
lighter makes of coats were other forerun-
ners of the season when minor poets rage ;
tweeds, satins and repp materials were used
in their fashioning, while imitation astra-
clmn leather and figured fabrics took the
place of furs for the adornment of collars.
'Tweed tailored suits with. accompanying
furs again found patronage. Mrs. Rupert
Greene was so attired in a costume of cocoa
tone with felt millinery. The Lud Mayor
and Mayoress were among the punters, she
kolinsky fur-coated. Miss F. McPherson
was another well clad in tweed. Mrs. Lauchie
Mackinnon’s bright-red coat with sable about
the collar and wide-leafed felt hat of the
roseate hue made an arresting glow.
Dr. Murray Morton’s wife was in black.
Mrs. Richard Linton sported a coat of
gazelle. Mrs. James Puves and Valerie,
Mrs. E. M. Pearce, Mrs. Charles Mitchell,
the Richard Turnbulls and Dr. and Mrs.
Barry Thomson were noticed in the packed
members’ stand.
The battalion of first-nighters was at full
strength when “Journey’s End” hopped the
bags at the Theatre Royal. Humor is
blended with tragedy in this military play,
and realism is supplied by effects such as
a smoke screen preliminary to a raid and
sulphur bombs which destroy a dug-out and
the British officers. However, all answered
the roll-call in front of the curtain, when
there was a remarkable demonstration, with
a special hand for each individual performer.
The leading man. Reginald Tate, took four
paces to the footlights and made one of the
briefest speeches on record; the orchestra,
which had added atmosphere during the inter-
vals by playing old army airs, struck up the
National Anthem, and the rather subdued
audience filed out.
It was a first night without flowers, for
there is no lady in the cast to accept them.
Mr. and Mrs. Percy Blackbourn were among
those in the stalls —the lady has just recov-
ever from a serious illness. Knight George
Tallis looked down from the managerial box.
as also did some Taits. Roma Smith’s ruby
velvet cloak with its bordering of white fur
caught the eye. Ada Reeve’s gold-patterned
shawl and Mrs. Bates’s brocade coat with
its large pink roses also stood out from
sombre wrappings in the neighborhood.
Artillerymen and cavalrymen of the
C.M.F. joined forces for the Military Ball
held at the St. Kilda Town Plall on Friday
night, and it was a brilliant affair. The
commanding officers of the three entertain-
ing regiments lined up to greet the guests.
Colonel H. O. Caddy smiled at the gathering;
Colonel F. P. Derham was accompanied by
Mrs. Derham, who wore a cornflower-blue
flounced gown; Lieut.-Colonel W. H. St.
Clair also brought his life-partner, who was
softly clad in black chiffon. The Lud
mayoral Luxtons stepped into the party,
Mrs. Luxton swathed in georgette of Lido-
blue with some frills and loose drapery.
Major W. S. Scrivener was everyone’s
batman as lion, secretary, and is hereby
mentioned in dispatches. A small company
of brother officers served as excellent rein-
forcements in the evening’s manoeuvres.
A very Americanised Hector Goldspink is
in Melbourne on business connected with his
late father’s will. He is the only son, but
two sisters will share in the substantial
estate. The singer, who is unmarried, in-
tends returning to the U.S.A.
When Giannini went along to receive a
welcome from her own people through the
medium of the Dante Society, she wore a
black lace frock wrapped about with a gold
and black brocaded coat and an ermine
Stole. A presentation sheaf of blossoms car-
ried out the Italian colors, red, white and
green. The Old Collegians of the P.L.C. lent
their commodious quarters for the gathering;
Signora Giannini, who was an outstanding
violinist in her day, accompanied her famous
daughter. Some samples off local art were
contributed by songbirds Cora O’Farrell and
Emilie Murray, who received encouraging
appreciation from the star.
The Novar Red Cross Hospital at Bal-
larat is claiming the case of Sister Hart-
ridge as little short of a miracle. Injured
by a bomb during the war, the sister has
been confined to a cot for seven years. She
spent her early years of martyrdom at the
Caulfield Military Hospital, whence she
often travelled to Ballarat, her stretcher
being a familiar spectacle to passengers.
Recently she tried a few hesitating steps.
She is now able to walk short distances. The
doctors believe that she will be permanently
restored.
The Vic. branch of the Country Women’s
Association is extending its influence, thanks
to keen workers and an alert president,
the Mitchell lady. The holding of a Handi-
crafts and home-industries exhibition on
September 20 and 21 is now occupying
attention. It will be staged in the upper hall
of the Town Hall; the enthusiastic Edward
Millers have undertaken to pay the rent.
The Lud Mayor's Ball to-inorrow night
is the big social event of the week. The
gold-lettered invitation-cards were extra o.s.
compared with invitations to previous civic
functions, and one of the burgesses was
heard to remark that some difficulty was
experienced in getting his through the door-
way of his office.
Hats that will bloom with the spring are
light and airy and larger than the close-
fitting felt variety, resembling the aviator’s
head protection, that has held our fore-
heads in a vice for so long. The very finest
straw, like canvas, is used in tin* millinery
which has just come from its bed of tissue-
paper for exhibition in shop-windows and
show-rooms. The craze for lace has spread
to hats. The trimming of these latest models
is “lace” that is made of straw, so cleverly
and delicately woven as to deceive the eye.
It covers crowns, is lot in as insertion, is
made into smart bows, or is put on in bands.
Very often it is the same hue as the hat.
and in narrow width edges the brim. Again,
lace patterns are stamped out on the new
models, all helping to convey flic idea of
coolness and a certain air of festivity.
The first tea-brewing of the Victoria
League at its new quarters in the Auditorium
buildings was occasion for special rejoicing.
The Best lady was one of the hostesses, and
Jean Hambleton, Norman Bradshaw and
Joseph Foster raised voices in song, Eric
Fox being at the piano. Members cast
approving eyes upon upholstery of brown and
lime patterned cretonne and window drap-
eries of pale green. Notwithstanding the
floral famine there was no lack of jonquils
and other yellow blooms.

Dr. Henry Searby has taken a permanent
partner in Mary, only daughter of the
Arthur Hordern couple, of South Yarra; the
contract was drawn up by the Rev. Richard
Sherwood at St. Paul’s Cathedral. The lady,
who has done a lot of travelling—only lately
she returned from a Continental tour with
her mother—wore a gown of ivory ring velvet
fashioned on mediaeval lines ' with a girdle
of pearls. White tulle that flowed to form
a train was attached to a coronet of old
lace, and a sheaf of lilies-of-the-valley was
in the picture. She had no attendant, but
Dr. Robert Brodie assisted his brother-medico
as best man. A few relatives and old friends
gathered at the Horderns’ flat to wish the
newly-weds the best of luck.
Nora Wilks, now flashing 13 sparklers on
her left hand as token of her engagement to
Lieutenant Allan D. Cairns, of the R.A.N.
—l3 is her lucky number —is a Miss with a
serious bent. When her student days at
Lauriston Hall were past, she swotted
through a science course at the Uni. She
is a daughter of the Rupert Wilks couple

Malvern city during their term of omcc. mio

Giannini gave a crowded matinee audience
the privilege of seeing her in evening array ;
unlike most concert artists in such circum-
stances. she left her millinery at home,
and swept yards of train about the foot-
lights. Velvet of blood-red ruby tone was
her gown; the line gracefully ebbed, and
the sleeves were long, with just a bit. ot
gold embroidery to mark the \ corsage, a
fascinating ensemble with her slnny black
hair Molly Bernstein, who was in sapphire-
blue spread some additional flounces ot

The Hotel Windsor had the gay air of a
Melbourne Cup night when the Toorak and
Armadale Auxiliary of St. Vincent’s Hospi-
tal ran cards and a -cabaret in aid of the
institution. Bridge tables were almost for-
saken, for the 400 or more patrons sought the
lounge, where there were ballets by pupils of
Jennie Brenan and Minnie Everett, and
favorite artists lifted voices in song. The
programme was steered by Eileen Castles,
who was of the trillers, wearing draperies
of grey steel-beaded. The president, Mrs. T. J.
Ryan, widow Qf Bananaland’s ex-Premier,
worked hard ; a posy of Parma violets rested
on a shoulder of the lady’s lavender georgette
gown. Mrs. Len 11. Buxton, arrayed in
cosmos pink, with Mrs. H. Krohn and some
other workers, set up a stall in the vestibule
with supplies of balloons, sweets and caps
to reap some further coin. Mrs. Dimelow,
whose apparel was black lace, was lion. sec.;
Mrs. Arthur Joyce and Miss E. Newman
being ticket distributors.
The Corona Club had its final flutter of
the season at Prince’s, Howey-place, on
Thursday night. The dressing indicated that
feminine fancy is turning towards a new
green for evening finery; apple, lettuce and
almond shades are being cast aside for a
very pale tone which is rather difficult to
catalogue—maybe grasshopper copies nearest
the mark, Madeline Mackay Sim aired the
color in her beautifully-cut satin frock:
Kathleen Lascelles wore almost the same hue
in her moire gown; and Mrs. Keith Allard’s
model was of a like georgette of dipping line.
Mr. and Mi-s. lan Hamilton were there,
she in her wedding raiment of layers of
white tulle; also the Charles Forresters,
Mrs. F. in white georgette with floating-
panels ; and Dr. M. Brendon O’Sullivan and
his wife, whose black lace gown had a- fes-
tive note of lilies of the valley. Mrs. Fred
Mateau had some autumn-tinted blossoms
on her biscuit-colored georgette gown.
Valerie Purves was arrayed in black tulle,
and Evlyn Leahy, of Bananaland, who is
contemplating another trip to Java, wore
a floral georgette gown that was of primrose
background splashed with blue and fawn
roses. The Hugh Hamilton couple, and Roger-
Black, a visitor from America, who came
with Mickey Plunkett, -were others sighted.
Workers for the Women’s Hospital report
a difficulty in raising funds. There have
been so many SOS calls from other quarters
this year that big donations are not forth-
coming, and that old stand-by bridge-and-
cabaret has to do overtime service. A com-
mittee has scattered tickets for a gala night
of cards and music at the Oriental Hotel
on Saturday, August 24. The offertory
(tickets are half a guinea) will be devoted
towards the Women’s Hospital appeal for
£lOO,OOO.
Many people mingled in fox-trot and one-
step at No. 9 with the good purpose of pro-
viding the Collingwood cr&che with a play-
ground. Mrs. Monty Grover cheerfully should-
ers part of the blame: and lier husband and
C. J. Dennis jointly plead guilty to a side-
show, “Ginger Mick’s Two-up School.” It
was a very pleasant function, with a regular
galaxy of bonnie girls. Joyce Hammond, one
of the lion, secs., came in white tulle and
silver tissue ; Jean Ferguson, her partner, was
a symphony in red chiffon; Mrs. E. Edwards
had array of gold lace; and Mrs, .Lennox
Speirs’s oyster-grey satin gown dangled
drapery in cape effect from the left shoulder.
Betty Barrett’s black-and-white frock was
outstanding, the skirt being black-pleated
taffeta, with top of white satin joined in
petal form sprinkled with glitter of gold and
crystal. Kitrie Currie featured draperies of
ruby-red lace; Margaret Allen was a good-
looking maiden with an orchid upon one
shoulder of a pink georgette gown : Phyllis
and Alison Mein, handsome brunettes, wore
uneven lengths of floral chiffon; Mamie
Falkiner’s frock was alternate bands of black
silk ribbon and tulle. Nancy Jones, who
made a professional appearance with the
Vanbrugh-Boucicaulc co. in Maoriland, was
in black velvet.
Hawthorn is arranging a bal manque at
Manresa Hall on August 29, in the interest
of the Ladies’ Benevolent Society and other
organisations, for the relief of distress
caused by unemployment. All such societies
are hard pressed these days.
At the annual meeting of the Wattle
League the president, Mrs. Britomarte James,
lamented the prevailing lack of interest in
its efforts to preserve the national flower.
The league is always ready to help in the
raising of wattle groves in schoolgrounds
and parks, but finds it difficult to shake up
enthusiasm in the right quarters. Knight
William Sowden, of Adelaide, who is the
Wattle Leaguers’ Australian president, was
with his wife an interested guest of the
gathering at the Lyceum Club. A special
wattle festival is being engineered for Sep-
tember 7, the proceeds going to the Home for.
Crippled Children at Frankston. Mrs. James
was re-elected head of the Victorian branch
of the League.
A rainy afternoon was well spent in the
cosy studio of Bernice Edwell in Darling-
street, South Yarra. While the kettle boiled
the artist brought out some miniatures which
will form portion of her next-year’s show.
Miss Edwell lived in Sydney and Adelaide
before coming to Melbourne. Besides minia-
ture portraiture, she does bits of bush and
sea on ivory and canvas. By the way,
artists are hard pushed to find studios in
Melbourne. Miss Edwell converted her kit-
chen into a workroom, a partition being
knocked out and a bow-window put in, with
a green door and steps leading to the garden.
The Theatre Guild staged four short Aus-
tralian plays at the Queen’s Hall recently.
The best of the bunch was “The Section."
by Mostyn Wright, the T.G. producer; a
capital study of selection life well acted,
especially by the two young people who
played the school-girl daughters, Mr. Wright
being the worried male parent. A. D. Gil-
fillan’s “A Friend in Need,” a comedy of
the early-Victorian period, also suggested
possibilities; George Walton carried off the
honors among the actors. H*. N. Gregory,
-who made an outstanding success in tie-
Repertory Theatre’s performance of “Juno
and the Paycock,” blossomed forth as the
author of a thing called “Clouds,” with a
melodramatic plot. Jean Vaughan was
the bright, particular person in a double-
romance of the kitchen entitled “A Fixed
Position,” by Laura Wilson. Intervals were
cheered by the songs of Dorothea Neigh-
bor and Alice Wells.
So Sydney’s Mr. Bavin will have a less
gloomy homecoming than his dear friends
on the other side probably hoped for; still he
may prefer to be told about splendid timely and
general rains than that Mick Burke and
Bondy Hoare were waiting in the queue to
shake hands with him. South Aus., which
wants a fall very badly, hasn’t had mon-
th an a lick and a promise at the time of
writing; but all except one corner of parched
N. S. Wales has been pretty well soaked —
thoroughly soaked in most instances —the
Commonwealth meteorologist reported at
noon to-day (Monday). And there were then
great hopes that our own distressed Malice
would get a last-moment reprieve from the
threatened crop failure.
The Albert-street Conservatovium intends
providing musical uplift with a series of six
matinee subscription concerts at the Assem-
bly Hall, Collins-street, beginning on August
14 and continuing each alternate Wednesday
until October 23. Edouard Lambert and his
son Raymond are to provide the first pro-
gramme. These recitals have been particu-
larly planned to suit folk who don’t lik* -
leaving the fireside these wintry nights.
Mildred Gibson, a young Australian who
has won some stage fame as a singer after
years with the Firm, has said good-bye to old
scenes. She has the talkies in view as a
career. Before she left, her sister Jean came
from their home in the West and slipped into
the departing one’s place. Another song-
bird who has put down her name for an
early sailing is Adele Crane.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Ka iyer
SHEER

HOSIERY
There were two big presentation parties
last week to Mrs. E. M. Lawton, wife of
the retiring Consul-General for America. Tin;
first was at the Stores, when for the last
time Mrs. Lawton was hostess to the Ameri-
can Circle which she formed on her arrival
in Sydney six years ago. Like almost every
other American woman who comes to Aus-
tralia, Mrs. Lawton lias fallen under the
spell of the opal; so to keep her truly won-
derful opal necklace company, the members
of the Circle gave her a pair of opal ear-
ornaments set with diamonds. The beauty
of them just took her breath away, and no-
thing would do her hut to wear them home
from the party. A tortoise-shell dressing-
set was another little item about which Uncle
Sam’s Customs officers will he asking ques-
tions.
The second party was staged by the
English-Speaking Union. Here Justice Sly
handed over a book of Australian views, and
Mrs. Mackenzie Adams gave her dear friend
a rose-pink ostrich feather fan.
As the Girl in the Flat Opposite puts it,
11.M.A.5. Penguin sang its swan-song mid-
way through last week. For the last time
its quarter-deck wrapped itself in gay awn-
ing, and before you cast your eye over
this page the Penguin will have gone out
of commission. The ship was moored along-
side Garden Island, and under the light of
a frail new moon the guest-laden launches
sped from the Steps across the trembling
waters, passing the grey bulk of the Aus-
tralia on their way. The wardroom officers
were the evening’s hosts, and Commander
Garsia the principal guest; and over all the
hand of the Australia played. There was
military scarlet mixed with the blue of the
Navy. Mrs. Sep Levy aired graceful black
laces, whose uneven hem drooped gradually
to a narrow train. Commander Hogan’s
lady was another exponent of black lace.
The Captain Rex Bennett couple (Tas.)
were among the dancers ; and the professorial
Fawsitts; and Captain Daniell and his lady,
she clothed in flowing red lace. Lieut. C. C.
Baldwin was responsible for the night’s
admirable arrangements.
If a ball’s standing is gauged by its debs.,
last week’s Masonic dance was among the
higher nobility. No fewer than 49 slips of
girlhood decided on it as thp scene of their
('mancipation from the schoolroom. The
right worshipful brethren saw that the Town
Hall was properly decked for the pageant
of tulle aud chiffon, and all the galleries
and pillars were rosy with garlands, gallant
with flags and significant with blue bows.
But the procession of members completely
wiped the eye of the xvhite and silver debs.
There was the flash of scarlet a'nd almost
as many ripples of blue as can be seen
across the Pacific on a summer’s day when
grandmasters and most worshipful brothers
swept behind their fluttering banners. Here
they were received, very fittingly, by Brother
E. Hungerford, president of the Freemasons’
Benevolent Institution, which absorbs the
night’s takings. Last week’s was the 36th
anniversary of the first Freemasons’ ball in
.Sydney, and what with patrons of the gal-
lery as well as the dancers quite a thou-
sand enjoyed the party. To Mrs. F. C.
Ma,rlow fell the job of presenting to the
(Governor the long line of girls who stepped
beneath an arch of crossed swords and gar-
landed wands. Toning in with their white
and silver, the matron of honor wore azure-
blue georgettes patterned with silver gum-
leaves.' His Ex. had in his company the
Kelso Kings and Civic Commissioners Garlick
and Morton with their ladies, Edna Goul-
ston in white georgettes and Mrs. J, S.
Miller, whose husband directed the cere-
monial of the night.
The rain did not interfere with the roll-up
to the A.I.F. Ball at David Jones’s on Satur-
day night. And as every other man was
in uniform, naval or military, and decora-
tions were worn, the scene was brilliant.
Bunting and flags fluttered, gaily against the
dark green of the laurel, which was used
largely in the decorative scheme. The pillars
in the ballroom wei’e linked together by
festoons of greenery, and on each pillar was
a laurel garland with an A.I.F. victory let-
tered in gold. It was down this Avenue of
Victory that the Governor and Lady de
Chair, with General and Mrs. Gordon Ben-
nett and daughter Elaine and son Graham,
walked to the beating of the drums and
found their place on the dais. On the offi-
cial table, the Rising Sun in golden poppies
.was a magnet that drew all eyes. Here, with
Lady do Chair in midnight-blue georgettes
on which sequins glittered, sat Mrs Gordon
Bennett in pillar-box red georgette, Mrs.
E. A. Buttenshaw in Lido-blue velvets, and
Mrs. F. A. Chaffey in a georgette frock
that blushed rosy through beige lace. Palest
piuk taffettas were worn by Elaine; and
like a little snow-maiden was the one deb.,
Maisie Mann, daughter of Captain and Mrs.
G. \V. Mann, in white lace and tulle. Pro-
ceeds go to the Limbless Soldiers’ Appeal
and Furlough House.
The glory that was Greece lived again
in statuette and in a graceful tableau of
attendant maids, such as Sappho herself
might have trained in Mitylene, on a night
of last week. The occasion was the Hellenic
Ball in David Jones’s, and beauty in the cos-
tume of ancient Greece had Professor Wood-
house as its instructor. Most of the group
that draped itself about the auditorium
steps as tiie guests of honor and walked
from the lift to the ballroom, were students of
Greek from the Professor’s Uni. classes. Then
there was a Grecian tango and folk-dances
that might have been stepped when Theo-
critus piped his gentle measure amid flowering
meadows. For these three cheers go to Mrs.
Chrysanthopulos, wife of the Greek Consul,
and to Mrs. C. Theodore. The Langridgc
School sent along a group of dancers to show
how men and women kept free of the
middle-aged spread before Scotchmen inven-
ted golf ami the first corset-maker was
unborn. A ballet arranged by Minnie
Everett and a solo dance by Joan Fuller
were other patterns in the pageant of the
night.
The hall had been designed to fit into the
Ambassadors, but, that being still in a state
of disrepair, Greece had to ripple and flow
elsewhere. This the committee thought inter-
fered with the attendance, which neverthe-
less numbered 500. Mrs. John Garlick was
president of the ball, and fluttered georgettes
that suggested a soothing lemon drink —a
pale yellow crusted with crystal. Mrs. Chry-
santhopulos wore silvery velvets lit with
rhinestones. Major and Mrs. Longfleld
Lloyd represented Government House; Dame
Mary Cook looked in, swirling silver-tipped
georgettes. The Knight of St. James’s and his
lady had about 40 young things under
their wing. Secretary Mrs. C. Straty presided
over a party which included an ambassador
from the Benevolent Society, whose hospital
for women at Paddington shares the takings
with the fund for the Greek Cathedral. The
wife of Vice-Consul Economus was frocked
in palest pink.
Isabel Letham, pictured for The Bulle-
tin by Monte Luke, has returned to her
native Manly after eleven years spent in
teaching young and not-so-young America
how to swim.
The Sydney
girl acknow-
ledges, how-
ever, that
America
taught her
quite a lot of
t, h e science
of te a c h ing
others how to
do it. The
feat she is
proudest of is
the opening up
of the watery-
way for a San
Francisco girl
who is totally
blind. This she
did in the
swimming pool
of the largest
women’s club
in San Fran-
cisco; it towers above Pershing Square
within stone’s-throw of the St. Francis Hotel.
Miss Letham has been the club’s director of
swimming since it opened its doors three
years ago. Now its membership numbers
7000 and there’s- a waiting list of 3000. You
can imagine that the din about that swim-
ming pool is terrific on the hot days, even
though the whole 7000 aren’t trying to swim
at once. It was bewildering to one without
the gift of sight. But the Sydney girl took
her pupil by the hand, and at her tenth
visit to the pool the girl whose ears and
quick brain are her eyes was swimming with
even strokes the 25 yards of its length.
From the swimming pool the bather can
pass on to the gym, thence to the restaurant,
and finally to the beauty-parlor, which sms
her hair-wave, steadies her complexion and
makes her just right to face any function.
A queer little feature of the palatial institu-
tion (it has 92 bedrooms) is the Economy
Shop. This is within the Gift Shop, where
glittering goods are sold on commission. The
Economy Shop is stocked with the discarded
garments and belongings of the rich members.
Some are beautiful Paris and New York
dresses and coats which their original buyers
will have worn not more than six times at
the outside. Some have been used but once.
But the owners tire of them and get a
philanthropic thrill from selling them for
a trifling sum to the Economy Shop, and
here the nice woman member not blessed with
too much wealth buys .quite a lot of her
party raiment. The day before Miss Letham
left one member wanted to buy cheap a
parrot cage of extra-large dimensions. The
assistant went through her list of wealthy
bird-owners, and by night-fall the parrot’s
cage was waiting to be called for !
Before she was director' of swimming at
the Women’s Club, Miss Letham was assis-
tant director of the sport at the University
of California and at the playgrounds run
by the City and County of San Francisco.
Here the children of all nations come to
learn the games that keep them fit. Among
her pupils were little Chinese, of a shining
cleanness, says Miss Letham, from the gold
pins in their hair to their dainty under-
garments; Syrians; Italians, big dark eyes
and flashing teeth : Swedes, phlegmatic, stolid,
scarcely laughing at all, hut doing incredible
tilings in the water, yet beaten even at this
game by some of the Irish-American kiddies.
Here’s a May Moore photograph of M ar-
gil ret Preston, probably the most vivid
painter of still-
life in Austra-
lia. All her
pots aud jai-s—
-and she seems
to have scoured
the bazaars of
the Orient for
them—are as
clamorous with
life as arc the
p h i 1 o sopliic
jars in Omar.
II e r flowers
are wanton,
1 • rovo cative
beauty, and by
virtue of her
melons, bana-
nas and cray-
fish and her
total disre-
gard for pota-
toes, this Let-
ter nominates
her as artist-laureate to the Housewives’
Association. Mrs. Preston is a tremendous
ban-acker for the use of Australian flora and
fauna in design, and in the vivid show of
her work now on view in the Grosvenor
Galleries white and red and pink gum-blos-
som, banksia, the bottlebrush and the kooka-
burra are happy ingredients.
Lady de Chair, who had visited Mrs. Pres-
ton’s Mosman studio previously . and picked
out a bowl of larkspur and a study of
Westralian banksia for her own purchase,
gave the collection of joyous canvases her
vice-regal blessing midway through last week.
Being an afternoon affair woman filled the
little gallery—an occasional professor or art
critic dropping in now and then. But no-
thing in the male line happened to cause a
woman to raise her hand to see if her side
curls were at the truly fenynine angle. Lady
de Chair massed with horticulture was sup-
ported by Mark Sheldon’s lady and General
Anderson’s wife, and was quite flattersome
in her remarks, the creator of the show mean-
time looking very pink of cheek between a
black ensemble and the brim of an attractive
hat. Spring hats were a feature of the
muster. Ethelwyn Kirk came with the
William Moores, surmounting her fair tresses
with a brick-red bonnet of the newest line.
Dr. Constance D’Arcy, too, had caught the
millinery germ and crowned her dimples in
expensive headgear of black; poetess Dora
Wilcox was in a green and black top-
piece ; and artist Florence Lake wore a hat
of melting blues. A pretty Mott girl from
Melbourne was another whose hat won a
second and maybe third glance.
Members of the Public-school Teachers’
Federation and of the Teachers’ College Re-
union Club joined forces at the Wentworth
for their sixth yearly dance. Even the baby
blackboard upon each table with the name
of host or hostess failed to bring any savor
of the schoolroom into the frolic. Light
blue, black and gold, the Teachers’ College
colors, were woven into the decorations, and
the gold of wattle and daffodils blazed on
every table. A fair dominie in yellow satin,
Rene Kelly, helped president L. G. Walsh
to entertain at the official table at which
sat Minister for Education Drummond and
Mrs. Drummond, Director of Education
S. H. Smith, acting vice-president T. Roberts
of the Teachers’ College, president A.
McGuinness of the Teachers’ Federation,
and several other highlights of the educa-
tional world.
Miss Kimura, the sparkling little sec-
retary of the Y.W.C.A. in Kyoto, at present
a guest at Sydney headquarters, beckoned
her Japanese friends to tea at the rooms in
Liverpool-street last week. The wife of Con-
sul-General Ivishi was there, with 14 other
slim ladies of the Chrysanthemum. Those
who are resident in Sydney were told in
a burst of bright and rippling Japanese
the benefit of joining the International Club
at the Y.W.C.A. Then they sang together,
sometimes in Japanese, sometimes in Eng-
lish, and laughed a great deal, and drank
tea and kept an eye on small offspring who
were playing with toys and balloons pro-
vided by Y.W.C.A. president Miss Fowler,
who was an interested guest.
A correspondent tells of a meeting with
the long arm :
When the Governor planted an oak at Hurlstone
College on Arbor Day it reminded me of another his-
torical tree-planting at which I was present 60
years ago, when Lady Belmore, wife of the then
Governor, planted an oak in Market-square (since
Belmore-square) in commemoration of the opening
of the railway to Goulburn; and I mentioned the
fact to a little group of friends. At the planting ol
another tree at Hurlstone, half an hour later, an-
other man told us that he was present on the
occasion when Lady Belmore planted her memorial
tree. As there can be very few people still living
who witnessed the event, wasn’t it remarkable that
two of us, quite unknown to one another should
meet under such circumstances?
Convalescing after pleurisy in' Prince
Alfred, the wife of Dr. Derrick Knowles finds
life rather pleasant than otherwise these
w intry days. Her lot is cast in the Honora-
ries’ Ward, as her husband is the sunray
expert attached to that model health-rest-
oring colony. Sister Madge Titheradge and
her new husband are spending the American
summer in a sort of fairy-tale palace they
call a country house at Greenwich, Con-
necticut. When the colder days come they
will hibernate in a New York apartment.
Edgar Park, the husband, is one of those
strong, silent men of America’s business
world whose words to their wives are liter-
ally pearls—when they’re not emeralds nor
diamonds.
“Here’s a pot of my jam, Mrs. ’Arris,’ 1
said Mrs. Next Door across the back fence.
“I made it yesterday when the gas was ‘off.’
You can get a good flow then; but when
everybody’s usin’ it, the supply’s so poor
you can’t cook anything with it. In these
had times, Mrs. ’Arris, you have to seize
your opportunities.”
No Sydney penwoman visiting Brisbane
hut has had hospitality from Mrs W. Young,
now head of the Technical College Domestic
Science School, and for 15 years social editor
of the Courier. Of late years Mrs. Young
has spent her summer vacation in Sydney,
so there’s quite a wide circle to feel elation
over the capable lady’s election as vice-
president of the Press Club of her home
town.
The S. M. Herald Fairfaxes are getting
back into the swim a hit. “Mr. Geoffrey”
has just been elected president of the Row-
ing- Association; he has been a vice-president
for years and naturally succeeds his old friend
Q. L. Deloitte. Before this latest election
the association in all its 51 years had only
two presidents: the first, George Thornton,
held office for 24 years.
Sydney is getting middle-aged. The North
Sydney Rowing Club surprised a lot of
people by announcing its 50th birthday-
celebrated with song and dance at David
Jones’s. Dark blue and white occurred on
every table, and a tall basket massed with
scarlet sweet-peas and violets on the official
table was surmounted by “N.S.R.C. Jubilee"
scrolled in silver. Over 400 dropped in for
the congratulations.
Under the title “Lady, Be Beautiful” the
Berlei Company is presenting a revue entirely
dressed in corset and brassiere. This will
take possession of Her Majesty’s Theatre on
the afternoons of August 19, 20, 22 and 28.
The revue symbolises woman’s search for
happiness, hope and health, and three
are typified by the blue bird, Pandora’s box
and the Temple of Hygeia.
The travelled Edith Armstrong, known
over half Europe as Miss Armstrong of
Pickford’s, came back to her native Sydney
last week and gave this Letter a new view-
point on the much-discussed subject of pay-
ing for baths when abroad. “Certainly,” she
says, “you pay a shilling; but, then, the bath
is properly washed out and the floor dried
thoroughly for each guest.” This Australian
is a walking “Enquire Within” on the sub-
ject of hotels here and in England. France.
Italy, Switzerland and Germany. The Quiri-
nal in Rome for its lighting in the big lounge
and writing-rooms, the light filtering through
a great dome of glass; the Grand Hotel
O’Connor in Nice for the blaze of zinnias m
its scrap of lawn ; the Suvretta at St. Moritz
for its white Swiss muslin curtains —these
remain most vividly in her memory. On,
yes, and the Villa Serbeloni on Lake Como.
This massive grey stone summer-house was
built over 600 years ago, and the recon-
structor lias merely added wings. In the
miles of grounds about the hotel the Aus-
tralian got a thrill from finding pittosporuni
and gum saplings.
The beginning of Australia-avenue, which
it is hoped will one day stretch from Sydney
to Canberra, marks an event big with possi-
bilities. It was fitting, too, that the first
tree, planted by the Governor, should te-
at the junction of Hume Highway anc
Macarthur-road, named after two men who
were such potent factors in the founding of
the nation.

THE FIGURES PROVE
BUSINESS HAS DOUBLED
T is time that the general public knew of the progress of a Banking Institution so
closely allied to the primary industries of Australia as is The Primary Producers
Bank. Such an intimation is now made. Figures prove that business has
doubled and more than doubled over the last four years. And, with such
a statement from the House itself it is right that emphasis should be given to the
optimistic reports of uninterested authority.
For this purpose we herein quote two extracts taken from the authoritative "Wild Cat
Columns of "The Bulletin.”
Extracts from “'Wild Cat , July 7, 1928
"The Bank is, however, treading a safe path—and with
the assistance of a W of good seasons the figures show
satisfactory expansion.”
"Since 1925 deposits have nearly doubled and advances
more than doubled.”
"The improvement last year was £266,115 in deposits
and only £149,054 in advances.”
Extracts from “VJild Cat , June, 1929
"The business continues to show very satisfactory expan-
sion. and General Manager Moffat came to the Company
with a good Queensland reputation as a conservative
Banker.”
"Over the last four years both advances and deposits
have more than doubled.”
"But what probably pleases the Management more than
anything else in those figures is the growth of £126,498
in last year’s deposits, despite a marked drop in last
year’s wool and wheat values.
"When the books closed at February 28, the Bank was
in the strong position of holding only £3/15/- of the
public’s money for every £1 of its own funds.”

Cjuessing At
TYRE PRESSURE
Is Extremely Costly
□
It is a mistake which takes
thousands of miles from the
life of your tyres . . . yet is
easily avoided.
Scientific tests, endorsed by lead-
ing tyre manufacturers, have proved
that 80 % of all premature tyre
break-downs are caused by failure to
keep tyres properly inflated.
How to avoid costly
Tyre trouble
Have your car or tyre dealer tell
you the correct pressure for your
tyres. Then buy a Schrader Tyre
Gauge, for balloon or high pressure
tyres, as you will require. The
Schrader Gauge is sturdy, depend-
able, easy to use, easy to read. Use
it frequently, once a week at least
and before long trips, to check the
actual air pressure. Always keep your
Schrader Gauge in your motor car.
Long life to your Tyres!
Now you can join the thousands of
experienced motorists who keep
their tyres correctly inflated, and get
every last mile of service from them.

and Mollie Stewart ’maided, Mervyn
Robertson best-manned and the Bellevue

Another wedding was that of Leslie Stuart
Johnson to Valda Ruthning in St. John's

by her father, A. F. T. Ruthning, wore
beaten silver patterned ivory chiffon and a
French veil of silver lace mounted on cameo-
pink georgette with knots of silver ribbon
and lily o’ the valley. Fay Ruthning,
Phyllis Hunt (Sydney), Noela Ruthning and
Royale Journeaux were bridesmaids, frocked
in sunburst-pink silk tulle with gold and
silver dots and wearing Dutch caps of
silver lace. Mr. and Mrs. Ruthning held

away frock was navy satin morocain and
guipure with a cloche en suite and fur coat.
Town is filling un for the Show, and so
are the pens in the Exhibition grounds. “The

dent of a political organisation, is called on

At the Naval and Military Ball on Thurs-
day night at the Freemasons’ Hall, North-
terrace, the uniforms were a blaze of scarlet
and gold braid. Our Navy had only one
representative, in Lieut.-Commander Lou-
doun-Shand, but the huge, old-fashioned
steering-wheel of the Protector held centre
position in front of the stage, with bunting
on either side. His Ex. and Lady Hote-
Ruthven, and Mayor Bonython and the
Mayoress were present. Her Ex. wore black-
ring velvet and pink pearls. Mrs. Bonython
was in scarlet lace, with a two-flounced
skirt and a trail of Sturt-pea on the shoulder.
Mrs. Loudoun-Shand was frocked in royal-
blue. georgette. Supper was served in the
basement amid a riot of poppies.
Sunday saw the fifteenth Violet Memory

stantinople. Their supply of English being
limited, Stephanie came to their assistance,
and they invited her to pay them a month’s
visit to Stamboul.

supper on the roof garden. A band of waits,
coated in snow, came in through the French
windows and emerged as Fred Nice’s orches-
tra. Generals Hobbs and Bessell-Browne,
Captains Dalziel and Bryant were there with
their ladies. Hetty Forbes wore palest trail-
ing primrose ninon ; her sister Madeline had
leaf-green frills sloping to one side; Doreen
O’Hara’s black georgette was patterned in
diamente, and Guida Weir was cloth-of-gold
clad, while Mrs. Cox danced in a swirl of

Hobart.
John Mclntyre (sometime Senior Puisne
Judge—he retired in 1913) and his lady
celebrated their diamond wedding in patri-
archal fashion among their children and
grandchildren at their home at Sandy Bay.
His Honor, though no longer able to move
about actively, was nevertheless able to
enjoy the day. and even the cake. The Ken-
wall Mclntyres and their young family)
motored down from the north to be present,
and all the local members of the clan rolled
up in force.
A golf team from Hobart ran across to
Swansea for their annual game with the
lads and lasses of the village, who were too
strong for them on this occasion. The homo
players sped the parting guests with a very
jolly dance at the Swansea Hotel. Mar-
garet O’Grady was in the Hobart contingent.
Miss Joan Allport produced a Barrie
double for the August Repertory Circle’s
play-reading, “Rosalind” and “The Old Lady
Shows ller Medals.” Catherine Collinane
and Joe Dickson, with Mrs. King as the
Scottish landlady, were excellent in the cur-
tain-raiser ; Mrs. Brough read the “Old
Lady” as finely as she might have prayed
her, and Rupert Wayne, in Highland kilt
and bonnet and a quite passable Scottish
accent, surpassed himself as the “adopted”
soldier son.
Mrs. Edith Water worth writes interesting
accounts of the doings of the International
Suffrage Alliance Conference at Berlin, where
she is representing the Speck as a delegate.
Mrs. Waterwortli is impressed by some of
the women delegates,. notably Annie Furnj-
helm, of Finland, the first woman ever elected

Mrs Hancock (Vic.) has been stirring up
the Aus. Women’s National League all over

The engagement is announced of Marion,
fourth daughter of the Percy Harrisons, to
Cecil, only son of Mrs. and the late L. J.
Wood, both of Launceston.
Among those who have recently returned

where they have been seeking health and sun-
shine, are Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Stops, the
F. X. de Bavays. the C. T. Butlers and the
H. Brettingham Moores.
Launceston’s musical folk rolled up in force
to the complimentary concert in aid of
Cecily Kelly’s training. The little songbird
herself contributed some of her own com-
positions.

Synopsis : Returning to New Guinea
after a holiday in Sydney, Stephen
Blalce, District Magistrate, is intro-
duced to Lesley Rowan bv Professor
Hicks, an anthropologist, who is visit-
ing New Guinea and had become
acquainted with the girl on board ship.
Blake, warmly attracted to her, is
about to confess his love, when she
tells him that she is going to marry
Harry Merton, a planter of Akupaka
Bay, the district in which Blake's out-
station lies. Blake knows “Flash
Harry” Merton well, but he keeps his
knowledge from the girl. Meanwhile,
Jimmy Glover, holding court as Assist-
ant-Resident Magistrate, imposes an-
other fine on Merton for cruelty to his
native laborers, and learns that the
native girl, Loana, who had been Mer-
ton’s mistress and had borne him a
son, has been returned to her village,
while the son has been sent to a mis-
sion school. Glover, fearing for the
white girl who is coming to marry
Merton, orders his native sergeant to
see that Loana is kept away from
Laubogi, Merton’s plantation. On the
boat Blake now avoids Lesley, who
consoles herself with thoughts of the
fiance she thinks she knows.
CHAPTER V ( Continued).
AN intolerable chill settled upon
Stephen Blake. Could be tell
her that the man who awaited
her at Port Moresby was a liar and
a cheat, a specious scamp who would break
her heart in six months? Could he shatter
her Castle of Enchantment, the shining
mansion she had reared about her, destroy
all her high hopes, and stand by watching
the color drain from her cheeks and the
tears welling into her eyes? He knew he
could not. Would not this straight, slim,
fearless young creature turn with loathing
and contempt from the man who with
clumsy words destroyed her faith? He
knew she would.
In that moment Stephen Blake cursed
himself for a coward.
A little sigh escaped her. “This voyage
—all these wonderful days—will stay with
me for ever as a very precious memory,”
she murmured. “Everybody has been so
kind to me, so thoughtful and considerate.
I think you men who live out your days in
the solitary places are the salt of the earth.”
Blake winced. He saw with fearful vivid-
ness the dreary years that lay' before her,
the misery, the humiliation, and the slow
waning of all her young beauty. He thought
of the cynical shrugs of the busybodies at
Port Moresby, their hushed whispers, their
elevated eyebrows, the honeyed venom that
would dribble when the teacups rattled.
Then it came upon him like a lightning
flash that he could, in some measure, make
it otherwise. That he, Stephen Blake, R.M.,
could open doors that would be closed in
the normal course of events to the wife
of Harry Merton. That he could make
smooth her path and ease her burden.
It was then that Stephen Blake saw his
course clearly before him. It was then he
took up sword and buckler in his lady’s
service.
She looked at him uncertainly. "You and
Hal arc good friends—mates—aren’t you?”
“Why, of course!” Blake lied evenly.
“How could it be otherwise? We live within
twenty miles of each other!”
“I’m so glad. Now tell me about Aku-
paka and the fascinating people I shall
meet there,” she commanded.
Blake pondered this, then plunged despe-
rately.
“At the station there is the assistant,
resident magistrate, Jimmy Glover. He is
the best fellow in the world. An abomin-
able dancer, but you’ll like him.” Blake
foresaw no difficulties with Jimmy Glover.
“I’m sure I shall.”
“Then we generally run to a junior, a pat-
rol officer, you know. There is a vacancy at
Akupaka at present. I think I shall try
and wangle young Jenkins.” He felt he
could trust Jenkins.
“I like Mr. Jenkins,” she told him
gravely.
“There’s a mission station, naturally,”
He must step warily here. “The white man
resigned last year, and I don’t think he has
been replaced. Then there is Tod Lorimer.
who owns Gabubu Plantation, about three
miles from the station. He is an elderly
widower, and has a grown-up daughter. A
half-caste.”
“I shall loathe him,” said Lesley promptly.
“On the contrary, you will like him. Old
Tod Lorimer is a white man and my very
good friend.”
Lesley’s eyes widened in curiosity. “I
see,” she said softly, but. it was obvious
that she didn’t. “Now tell me about Port
Moresby.”
“Port Moresby is the place where all
bad magistrates go when they die,” re-
turned Blake. “In the bush, an R.M. is
by way of being a lordly kind of bloke; in
Port Moresby he feels like a masterless pup.
You see, all the big guns and the little guns,
the howitzers and the pipsqueaks are
mounted there, and—but you’ll see Port
Moresby in all its entrancing beauty to-
morrow.”
“Are there no white women at”
“There are no white women at Akupaka,
Miss Rowan,” Blake replied gently. “Only
the men I have mentioned, and a few
others who don’t count.”
Lesley’s eyes grew wistful. “I shall be
very lonely, Mr. Blake,” she said in a small
voice.
“You’ll soon grow accustomed to it,” he
replied. “Loneliness is the common lot of
Harry Merton.
white people who make out-back Papua their
home. The things that count down south
become trivialities there, and our prob-
lems, our little tragedies would merely raise
a laugh in the busy haunts of men.”
He rose as he spoke.
‘‘Time to make ready for lunch. Miss
Rowan,” he exclaimed. “The last aboard
the Moratau for many a long day.”
A sudden flood of emotion, strangely
poignant, surged within Blake, and he felt
his heart pounding.
“It’s going to be hard,” he told himself.
“Damned hard!”
But he also told himself that he must
face things squarely; above all, he must not
“Lesley Merton now.”
make a fool of himself. He had ranged
himself definitely on the side of Lesley
Rowan’s rascally sweetheart, nor would he
deviate by so much as a hair’s-breadth from
the course he had laid down for himself.
But his resolution brought him no satis-
faction, and when after lunch he drifted
to the smokeroom, he wanted only to
retreat within himself, to wrestle anew with
the problem that confronted him.
Mervyn Woods sat at a baize-covered
table immersed in a game of patience.
Blake’s first impulse was to withdraw, but
the missionary had already moved forward
a chair with his foo.t and invited him to
be seated. Presently Woods swept the
cards into a heap, and leaned back, regard-
ing Blake thoughtfully.
“The young lady—Miss Rowan—is to be
married to-morrow,” he remarked.
Blake nodded.
“To an old friend of yours named Mer-
ton,” went on the missionary. “Is that
right?”
Blake nodded again.
“Quite!” he replied drily.
The missionary toyed absently with the
cards, but Blake was aware that his kindl.y
eyes were searching his face. He remem-
bered then, with a sense of shock, that
Mervyn Woods had “labored,” as he called
it, at Akupaka; that he had actually been
the incumbent four years ago when
“Is it as bad as that, Steve?” asked the
missionary suddenly.
Blake colored. “I don’t understand you,
Padre,” he answered stiffly. “We were dis-
cussing Merton.” He eyed W’oods bellige-
rently. “He was one of your intimate
friends in your Akupaka days, was he not?”
A grim smile touched the missionary’s
mouth. “Am I expected to perjure my soul,
Blake, to help you”
“Then why the devil don’t you put her
wise?” blazed Blake. “Are you man
enough? I’m not.”
There was a pregnant silence. Blake
steeled himself to bear with perfect com-
posure the keen scrutiny to which the mis-
sionary was subjecting him.
“I see,” Woods said at last. “It is not a
question of manhood,” he continued quietly
with a conviction that, was almost solemn.
“If any poor words of mine might spare
that dear child pain and humiliation I
would not hesitate to utter them. But her
whole being is wrapped up in Harry Mer-
ton; her belief in him is child-like in its
simplicity, and—who knows, Stephen?—she
may be the instrument designed by divine
Providence to save his soul alive; to’
“You’re talking nonsense, old friend,”
Blake broke in.
“You know I’m right, Steve,” returned
Woods gently. “It is my business to search
for the things that lie hidden in the
hearts of men, and I know that right back-
in your consciousness is the feeling that
Merton may 'come back.’ And you’ve made
up your mind to give him his chance, and
I’ve made up mine to help you.”
There was a subdued air of excitement,
an undercurrent of restlessness aboard the
Moratau that night. From the upper deck
came the syncopated clangor of the gramo-
phone, the sound of laughing voices and
the soft rustle of dancing feet.
Lesley Rowan was gay; her cup of happi-
ness was overflowing, for was not this amaz-
ing starlit night the eve of her wedding
day? All the evening women had fluttered
round her, her health had been drunk many
times in the smokeroom, Professor Hicks
had made a speech. Even Mervyn Woods
had drawn her a little apart, and had spoken
to her as a father would. And she had held
back with difficulty the tell-tale tears which
would have proclaimed the depth oi her
emotion. How kind they were, these
strangers! And what a cheerful, happy
world she was living in!
Blake alone had seemed strangely unre-
sponsive, and as now he sat by her side,
sunk in thought, she, too, fell silent, won-
dering. But everything was so novel, so
delightful, from the incredible closeness of
the stars to' the breath of the night breeze,
that her momentary depression lifted, and
she hummed a gay little tune under her
breath.
“This is our last night,” he said tritely.
“To-morrow—to-morrow I go back to
work!”
The sound of approaching voices and
shuffling, uncertain footsteps interrupted
him. Blake drew a breath of relief.
“We’d like to dance with the bride, if you
please,” blurted out Jenkins.
Blake assisted her to her feet.
“Go to it, my children,” he said hand-
somely. Suddenly he bent down towards the
gd'l.
“Please keep one for me, Lesley,” he said
in a tense whisper.
She nodded brightly. “Surely, Stephen.”
Lesley Rowan had but little skill in
reading the human face, but long afterwards
she remembered the look that altered his
whole countenance when she called him
by that ’name.
CHAPTER VI.
The Scented Tropics.
A group of lightly-clad passengers stood
silent at. the forward rail. A gentle breeze
had sprung up overnight. Later, it would
freshen to a steady south-easter, but now
it blew so softly as to raise no more than
ripples.
“It’s going to blow again,” complained
Lesley with a little shudder, “and I shall
be sick and red-eyed and—and horrid!’
“Don’t talk, young lady,” Mervyn Woods
enjoined severely. “Look straight ahead,
or you’ll miss it.”
“We’ll miss it in any case, Padre,” put
in Blake. “Too hazy.”
The passengers were now' hanging over
the rail, their heads craned forward, their
eyes straining ahead,. Suddenly Woods
stiffened and Lesley felt his hand tighten
on her arm.
“There!” he said tensely. “Just to the
right of the jackstaff—higher—much higher.
There!”
“O-o-oh!” gasped Lesley softly, and there
came a little murmur from the crowd.

Far ahead, towering aloft in solemn
majesty over a bank of misty cloud, a
mighty summit shimmered in the haze. For
a minute or two it stood out alone in an
immensity of sky, flushed a delicate pink
by the early morning sun, then fleecy clouds
rolled up, enwrapped it in a snowy mantle,
and the vision faded from their sight. It
was Mount Victoria, monarch of the mighty
Owen Stanley Range, in one of her rare
moments of visibility from the sea, flaunt-
ing superbly her age-old defiance of man.
Lesley and her friends lingered a while
after the others had gone below. She
was loath to leave the deck, loath to miss
the first real sight of the strange new
country that held all her hopes.
When, after breakfast, they returned to the
deck the silhouettes of distant hills showed
against the skyline—faint at first, but stand-
ing out with more vivid distinctness as the
ship drew nearer. Barren, burnt-up, un-
inviting they looked; no suggestion of the
glamor, the witchery, the enticement of the
scented tropics lay about them.
Jenkins uttered a startled exclamation.
"My hat!” he muttered darkly. “Some-
body has sold me a pup!”
Lesley’s mouth quivered. The unexpected
contrast, with all she had been expecting
roused in her a repulsion that shook her.
Mervyn Woods seemed to sense her distress.
She felt his hand upon her arm. He was
comforting her, reassuring her, but she
was afraid to look at him lest she should
break into frightened tears.
“If you want the real
Papua, my dear,” he was
saying, “you must seek her,
not in the settlements, but
in the bush. At Akupaka
you’ll work yourself up into
the proper state of ecstasy,
never fear.”
The roofs of houses, some
red, some blinding white,
were showing upon the hill-
sides, and to the left the
swaying tops of palms
seemed to spring miracu-
lously from the sea. Later
a gleam of snowy beach
showed at their bases, and
a long, low island pushed
itself up on the skyline.
The Moratau slowed
down, swept past a barnacle-
encrusted beacon, disturb-
ing a flock of sea-birds that
wheeled screaming over-
head, and held on under
the brow of the lowering
hills. A noble expanse of
placid water showed ahead,
blue as lapislazuli. A cone-
shaped island covered with
stunted eucalypts showed
in the distance. At its
base, nestling at the water’s
edge, were the palm-
thatched huts' of maritime
villages, off which queer,
claw-sailed craft cruised.
Lesley was vibrant with
excitement; a flush of color
gathered in her cheeks, and
with a little laugh of delight
she climbed on to a lifeboat
and sat there alone.
Now the ship was steam-
ing at a snail’s pace. The
engine-room telegraph
clanged. The Moratau
swung round in a half-circle,
and with a rattle of chains
came to anchor.
And it seemed to Stephen
Blake, as he listened to the
anchor chain screaming
through the hawse-hole, that
this marked the beginning of a new phase
of his life. He must learn to be tolerant,
sympathetic, understanding in his relations
with the lame-duck that Lesley Rowan had
chosen for a husband, and, above all, he
must maintain his dignity, keep his head,
and leave the rest to all-healing, merciful
Time.
But it was going to be hard. Damned
hard!
Dozens of small craft were moored off-
shore —unpainted, sun-warped ketches and
cutters deep laden with copra and rubber
for the Moratau’s holds; spick and span
harbor launches and trim cruisers that
bobbed and curtsied to the breeze; com-
fortable-looking auxiliaries that flew the
flags of mission societies; luggers from
Thursday Island, with here and there white
painted craft that flaunted the blue ensign
of the Administration over their taffrails.
Lesley sat undisturbed on her eyrie above
the deck, absorbed in contemplation of the
township. A sudden thrill of understanding
moved her and she experienced a curious
sense of kinship with the men who had
built their homes and planted their pathetic
gardens in this wilderness. The facades of
the many-windowed buildings on the water-
front seemed to flash a message to her, a
secret message that found its echo in her
own heart.
“We are the outward and visible sign,”
they seemed to say, “that the unconquer-
able white man is here. And he has brought
his wife and his children. And they are
here to stay.”
She forgot the gaunt, unfriendly hills and
the pitiless, blistering sun. The red blood
of the pioneers surged exultantly through
her veins. She saw only the beauty and
“‘It’s going to be hard,’ he told himself—‘damned hard.’”
the pathos, the fearlessness and the splendor
of it all, and her throat contracted and she
felt the sting of tears in her eyes.
A launch put off from the shore. She
was manned by fuzzy-haired, uniformed
natives, and two or three white-clad,
helmeted figures sat in the cockpit.
“All passengers below, please!’ The
voice of the purser roused Lesley from her
reverie. “Medical inspection on the lower
deck.”
Lesley joined the queue of passengers.
Perhaps Hal had come off in the launch;
perhaps even now he was waiting lor her
below, and she pressed forward with im-
patient eagerness. But Hal was not there.
Standing in a little group at the saloon
door she saw only the purser and the ship’s
doctor and an alert young man who would
be the port doctor. She heard Blake’s
name called; saw him saunter past the
door with hands outstretched; heard him
exchange greetings with the red-haired
young man, and pass out of sight.
Lesley felt suddenly nervous, felt her
heart racing, and her knees almost refused
their support.
“Sit down, my dear,” smiled Mervyn
Woods, “and don’t feel alarmed. It is no-
thing more than a very tiresome formality.”
“Miss Rowan!”
Lesley’s brain was in a whirl, but she
stepped forward, putting out her hands as
she had seen the others do. She felt the
keen eyes of the red-haired doctor search-
ing her face, heard his “Thank you, Miss
Rowan,” and, the ordeal over, she escaped
to the boatdeck.
She was standing away from the crowd,
a radiant figure of youth, lovely in her
tremulous eagerness. She made a little,
appealing gesture, and instantly Blake was
by her side.
“Stay with me, Stephen,” she breathed.
“I’m—l’m wretchedly nervous.”
Expectantly her eyes scanned the wharf.
All Port Moresby—white and brown-
seemed to be there. Here were sullen-eyed
wharfies from the Papuan Gulf, black-
nursave fofa strip of faded dungaree
wrapped about their waists; lustrous-eyed
house-boys from the East end, slight of
build light of skin, wearing snowy loin-
cloths and red shell-money nose and ear
ornaments, scarlet hibiscus blooms m then
teased-out hair, and plaited fibre bands on
tattooed legs and arms Here were bold-
eyed village belles, whose grass skirts
swayed rhythmically as they swept along
the ietty their Christian sisters from the
mission in shapeless “Mother Hubbards of
unspeakable ugliness; tight-laced, swagger-
ing bucks from the Mekeo; flat-footed, well-
fed orderlies from the Government offices,
with here and there upstanding, square-
shouldered men in the red-braided, blue
serge uniform of the Papuan Armed Con-
stabulary. . ,
Standing aloof at the jetty-head, away
from the chattering natives, were the lordly
white men. Here and there were gaily-
colored sunshades from under which female
eyes stared appraisingly at the passengers
on the incoming vessel.
Suddenly Lesley gave a little gasp, and
gripped Blake by the arm.
He felt her grow rigid.”
“There’s Hal!” she ex-
claimed excitedly. Her
color was high. Her eyes
were like stars. “there,
Stephen! At the end of the
jetty! Standing alone!”
She craned her head over
the rail, waving animatedly.
The man on the wharf,
conspicuously well-groomed,
lifted his helmet and his
dark face stood out clearly
in the sunlight.
A few yards only sepa-
rated ship and wharf now.
Blake experienced a curious
sense of unreality, as if his
mind had become detached
and hovered somewhere out-
side his body. He was only
half conscious of the radiant
girl by his side, and his eyes
dwelt gloomily on the face
of the man on the wharf.
Their glances met. Blake
saw Merton start. His face
took on a sullen, half-fearful
expression and he shifted
uneasily as if unwelcome
thoughts were coming into
his mind. Then his eyes
narrowed and he threw back
his head with a jaunty air
of defiance.
Blake saw Merton elbow-
ing his way through the
throng, then again he felt
the girl’s hand upon his
arm, this time timidly, un-
certainly.
“I can’t —can’t face all
these people,” she said with
a wan little smile. “Please
bring Hal to me, Stephen.
I—l shall be on the other
side.”
“Certainly,” he returned
in a quiet voice, but his
face was expressionless.
Blake tilted his chin, and
squared his shoulders. No
knight of old ever sallied
forth on his lady’s service
with so heavy a heart as
did Stephen Blake then. To
Mervyn ' Woods, standing
further forward, it was as
though Blake marched to
face a firing squad.
The two men met at the
foot of the companion.
Merton drew back to give Blake right
of way, and a dull flush mounted to his
face. It was obvious that he found the
meeting distasteful.
“’Day, Merton!” Blake was amazed at
the depth of geniality he had managed to
infuse into his voice.
Merton hesitated, and an expression of
perplexity came into his eyes. Instinctively
he was on the defensive. ,
“Oh, good-day, Blake!” he replied gruffly.
He flashed a quick, sidelong glance at
Blake’s face, hesitated again, and made to
mount the ladder. Then, abruptly, he
wheeled and looked squarely into the other’s

Mr. P. V. HARPER
Tells How ZAM-BUK Saved Him.
Writing from Tiparra, S. Australia,
Mr. Harper says: —‘‘I have experienced
the great soothing power of Zam-Buk.
For two years I had been a martyr to
piles. The complaint got so severe that
I was beginning to think of operation
as the only way to a cure. The burning
irritation was terrible and sometimes I
was too bad to move about.
“I took doctor’s medicine and used
ordinary ointments and salves, but un-
til I started with Zam-Buk it was just
throwing money away. Zam-Buk
overcame all pain, swelling, and inflam-
mation and soon banished the piles
completely. Zam-Buk is wonderful.”

eyes. He read nothing there save a mild
and genial interest.
“What’s the game, Blake?” he rasped. “Is
it—is it pax, Blake?” he asked.
“It is, Merton!” Blake answered convinc-
ingly. And they shook hands.
Three minutes later Lesley Rowan was
in her lover’s arms.
CHAPTER VII.
Wedding Bells.
They were married that afternoon at the
tiny mission church that nestled at the
foot of the rolling hills beyond the town-
ship. And the memory of their wedding
remained with Stephen Blake for ever. For
Blake was Merton’s best man.
The resident missionary welcomed them
at the doors of the church and ushered
them smilingly into the building. There
was no music save the lip-lap of wavelets
on the beach and the wordless chorus of
the trade wind ir the palms; no flowers save
the scarlet hibiscus blossoms and golden
alamanda blooms in the hair of the un-
invited guests at the windows; no shimmer-
ing, misty veil hid the bride’s face; no
bridal march, no photographers, no showers
of rice; no honkdng limousines at the
doors, no curious sightseers in the nave.
Lesley Rowan had never been lovelier.
.She stood at the altar rail with downcast
eyes, a slim youthful figure in white. So
cool she looked, so sweet, so calmly digni-
fied and yet so touched with pathos. Merton
stood by her side, tall, straight and stiff
as a ramrod, his starched collar already
limp, beads of sweat glistening on his fore-
head. A girl from the ship was on Lesley’s
left—a flushed, pretty girl who seemed on
the verge of tears—and young Jenkins
hovered in the rear, trying to appear bored
and not succeeding very well. Professor
Hicks was there, perspiring freely, his red
face beaming like a full moon. Once or
twice Blake caught him eyeing the bride-
groom with a faintly puzzled expression.
Mervyn Woods, grave, unsmiling, stood be-
hind the bride, and Blake supported the
bridegroom.
“Dearly beloved” Blake felt some-
thing clenched tightly in his clammy hand.
It was the ring Merton had handed him
in the car. He must remember to
The minister’s voice went on intoning the
solemn words gravely, reverently, while
Blake’s discomfort grew upon him, and he
felt an intolerable ache in his throat.
....“either of you know any impediment
why ye may not be”
He thought Merton was going to shy
like a startled horse. There was no impedi-
ment. Why did the parson pause? There
was no impediment—none whatever....
save perhaps deserted'Loana. Go on, man!
“love her, comfort her, honor, and
keep” Ho heard Merton’s response
and then Lesley’s clear voice. He saw
Mervyn Woods step forward solemnly and
give the Woman to the Man; saw the
minister looking at him, Stephen Blake,
with lifted brows. The ring, of course.
“for better, for worse richer....
poorer sickness health”
Merton was Lesley’s husband now—
almost—and his lifelong friend!
They were outside and he was filling his
lungs with great gulps of warm, moist air.
He found himself looking at his watch.
Merton would have to hurry. He had a
long journey ahead. He was wise to take
Lesley to the mountains for the honeymoon,
away from the heat and the glare, the cheap
men at the hotel, and their hard-eyed
womenfolk. It was the obvious thing to
do.
The driver cranked up; the engine sput-
tered and roared and the village people
leapt backwards. The driver mounted to
his seat, and leaned back with folded arms,
glancing round him with great satisfaction.
Mervyn Woods took Lesley in his arms
as a father would.
“My feelings for you are very deep, very
sincere,” he said, gently. “May your years
be full of happiness, my dear.”
Lesley clung to him for a moment, her
eyes wet, but she made no reply. The mis-
sionary shook hands warmly with Merton
and stood back. Merton’s eyes were in-
scrutable.
“ ’bye. Mrs. Merton!” Jenkins put in
jauntily. “All the very best, old thing!
Cheerio, Merton! Same to you!”
“All happiness to you both,” said Pro-
fessor Hicks. He looked hard at Merton,
and his face wore a strange look of mingled
uneasiness and sternness. “Look after our
little Lesley,” he added gruffly. “You are
a very fortunate young man.” ,
“The Professor has heard things,” thought
Blake.
It was his turn now. Lesley was looking
at him questioningly. Merton was showing
signs of impatience. A numb misery pos-
sessed Blake. He felt his finger nails dig-
ging into his palms, and his lips seemed
stiff. Lesley held out her hand with a
sweet air of gracious decorum.
“Good-bye Stephen!” she murmured.
Blake’s eyes leapt to meet hers. Lesley
had a sudden devastating vision of her last
night aboard the Moratau, of stars that
hung low. glowing like celestial jewels in a
black, velvety sky; of phosphorescent
waters, the droning of the gramophone and
Stephen Blake bending over her with just
such another expression of dumb suffering
in his eyes.
Deliberately she thrust the memory aside.
She was Lesley Merton now, and Stephen
was her husband’s good friend, and hers.
“Good-bye, Stephen,” she repeated firmly.
“Good-bye, Mrs. Merton,” he replied
w^}l purposeful briskness. “Good-bye,
Merton! Don’t forget the Siai on the
tenth!”
And so Lesley entered into her Enchanted
Kingdom, and if her mouth quivered a
little and her eyes were misty with unshed
tears, not even she knew the real reason

POUNDS OF PENNIES
“Take care of the pennies, and the pounds will take care of
themselves.” There is more in that old saying than perhaps
you realise. Pennies are more easily come by than pounds;
they are more easily saved, for a penn orth of self-denial is
easier to practise than a pound’s worth at a time.
Think it out —better still, try it out —the steady, sincere saving
of the small coins; the practical appreciation of the small
things and their cumulative value.

LILLI GORMHUILLE McKAY'S
STORY OF A GIRL WHO
FOUND HER MOTHER.
THE big poplar-tree outside the window
itistled silkilv in the afternoon breeze.
The sound, gentle though it was, dis-
turbed Templeton, irritating him curiously,
so that he rose and closed the glass door
leading on to the verandah. It was seldom
he noticed the voice of the tree, the “light
uuivering aspen” of verse and legend, that
filled the ol'd house with a sound as ot
soft rain in the still dusk. But to-day the
rustling brought with it a vague unrest.
Nerves, he assured himself, and proof of his
loathing of the ordeal before him. As lie
clicked'the door he caught a gleam of blue
through the flickering leaves, a gleam that
marked the passing in her small car ot
Helen, his daughter, who was driving to a
bridge-party across the river. He had pur-
posely chosen a day when she would be
away from the house until quite late, and as
lie heard the horn of the little two-seater
at the cross-roads he returned slowly to
his study table. Dorothea, his wife, was at
the Croquet Club, and the maids had gone
to a regatta somewhere down the river. He
was alone in the house awaiting the arrival
of Mirah.
lie had married Mirah twenty years ago,
when, as a penurious young law-clerk, he had
met her on one of his rare excursions into
his restricted social sphere. It was at a hoc-
key dance, and even to-day, nearly a lifetime
later, lie remembered with extraordinary
vividness her startling beauty. She had
worn a yellow frock and, with her masses
of golden hair, her white skin and wonderful
amber eyes, had se.emed to him like a young
goddess come to earth on a bacchanal. There
was always that pagan suggestion about
Mirah, her lithe form, her vivid coloring,
her hatred of method and routine, and, above
all. her inborn and ineradicable love of
dancing.
He had married her after a brief and
tempestuous wooing, tempestuous by reason
of Mirah’s varying moods and waywardness,
and they had settled down in a tiny cottage
on the outskirts of the town, where lie was
to study and garden in the intervals of re-
spite from the office, and she was to keep
the diminutive house and be his lodestar.
It had sounded idyllic in those far-off days,
and it had lasted exactly a year and a half.
Looking back on that time, Templeton mar-
velled it had lasted as long. It lasted until
he had grown to hate her wild, flamboyant
beauty, her solecisms, her gossiping, mischief-
making family and her impossible friends,
and she had come to detest her solemn young
husband, with his unnecessary ideas on recti-
tude and other unimportant matters, and his
attitude of silent criticism and hostility.
When Helen was born-* —Mirah had named
her Marquita after the picture of a Spanish
dancer she had in the bedroom, and lie had
insisted on the addition of the name of his
own dimly-remembered mother —he had been
sunk in utter despondency, seeing in the
hopeless future the child succumbing to
Mirah’s evil influence, and his own impotence
against her will and fierce possession.
Then suddenly, as a bomb that explodes
and clears the fairway, Mirah had eloped
with a young dancer whose turn was the star
attraction at the local theatre, a pleasant,
improvident youth. Templeton learned later,
who was modestly billed as “Alf Bruxton, the
World’s Most Famous Heel and Toe Dancer.”
He felt no resentment towards Alf Bruxton,
rather a dull gratitude, and divorced Mirah
immediately.
With her departure success had conn' to
him almost at once, rapidly and unexpectedly,
He was offered a position in a northern
firm, and passed on to an assured career. Of
Mirah and her dancing husband lie at first
heard occasionally; they were doing
vaudeville turns at. the New Zealand country
theatres, or conducting an academy in some
unfashionable suburb, or appearing in char-
acter dances at up-country functions, but
after the first few years he heard no more
of them.
When Helen was eighteen months old he
married Dorothea Fanning, the daughter of
the old vicar of Waitawa, aud when they
moved north he wiped the hideous memory
of his Canterbury days from the score-board
of his life. Almost, but not quite completely ;
the small allowance he bad instructed hi.s
Christchurch solicitors to pay to Mirah,
should she claim it, was regularly drawn;
a reminder that she was still alive.
He had never been romantically in love
with Dorothea. She represented to him a
haven, a quiet, restful woman who had taken
and cherished the child, who adored them
both, and made life smooth and pleasant for
all who came within her orbit. Helen be-
lieved her to be hen mother and Templeton
had no intention of letting her know other-
wise. Until Mirah’s letter asking for an
interview with him had arrived a week ago,
lie had felt sure the allowance, paid on con-
dition of no interference with Helen, would
keep Mirah silent. Now lie had lost that
certainty.
The aspen-tree rustled with a whispering
sound, and the gate clicked. Templeton did
not move until the door-bell rang,
His first impression of Mirah, when she
had dropped the heavy suitcase she carried
with evident weariness in the hall, and
thrown herself with the careless abandon he
remembered so well into a deep chair in the
study, was that she was more beautiful than
ever. He had expected to find her changed;
a roving life, illness and poverty, both of
which she had mentioned in her letter, must
have left their marks on her. They had,
buti not to deterioration, and the only effect
was a general toning down. The flamboyance
was gone, and in its place was a pale weari-
ness, though she still possessed her white
s kin and brilliant rippling hair,
“Well,” she said as Templeton seated
himself by the table, “I suppose you’ll be
wondering what I want. I’m going to get
cool a bit first. I’ve walked from the station,
Can I have a drink? Water, please.”
She fanned herself languidly with her
wide, black hat, her hair shining like an
aureole in the dark room, and sipped the
water slowly, watching him out of her long,
golden eyes. , ' ~ .
“Where’s the girl?’ she* asked suddenly.
Templeton moved the silver inkwell before
replying "She is not here,” he said,
«< w V where is sbc ? j wa nt to sec her.”
th( ht it was that,” Templeton said,
h b s eeu expecting it. We had better

Helen?”
‘‘Two pounds a week!” she snapped. ‘ And
you with all this! It’s a lump sum I want.
Alf and I are going to buy into a business
over at Banfield. Three hundred pounds
is what we have to put up. Alf’s not able
to dance now —he broke his ankle last year
and has to take on something else. Ihe two
pounds a week was all right when he was
working, but it’s nothing now. This chance
is too good to be lost. It’s Alf’s uncle tlia.t s
giving up, and he’ll let us have the lot tor
three hundred.”
“I’m sorry,” Templeton said. “There is
no certainty you will make a success of it.
In that case I should probably be called on
to face your liabilities and start you again. 1
am not a rich man. The allowance I now
give you is all I can let you have.
“You always were as near as the next
minute!” Mirah said mockingly. ‘ But don t
take that superior tone with me. You went
down on your knees and begged me to many
you aud then”
“I’ve told you my terms,” interrupted
Templeton. “They are not subject to altera-
There was a pause, the old tree rustled
softly, a car purred in the distance, the
drone of bees came slumbrously on the
breeze, and Mirah’s voice, with its metallic
ring, cut through the silence.
“All right. But you’ll be sorry. Maybe
if you won’t do anything for me my daughter
will. Anyway I’ll try her. Alf’s been ill
off and on for months now, and I’d go a
good way to help him.”
There was a pattering of steps outside,
light hurried steps; then the door was flung
open, hiding Mirah behind it, and Helen came
in. She took oh! her hjat as she entered, and
with a characteristic gesture ran her fingers
through her fair shingle, stooping as she
passed to print a light kiss on the top of
her father's head,
"Oh Daddy, such a tragedy,” she ex-
claimed breathlessly. ‘‘Poor Molly has
mumps. Mumps! Some of the others stayed,
but I didn’t dare risk it with Brenda’s wed-
ding on Wednesday. Imagine a bridesmaid
with mumps! So I decided to come home
and do some gardening. Oh, I beg your par-
don —T didn’t know there was anyone here.”
In that moment both the others had looked
at her fixedly—Templeton with a sinking
heart at the girl’s laughing face; Mirah with
a sudden surge of feeling, half curiosity, half
jealousy. She saw a tall, slender girl, fair
and blue-eyed, not beautiful as she had been
at the same age, but lovely with a flower-
like delicacy of coloring and sweetness.
Mirah held out her hand. “Come and
shake hands with me, my dear,” she said
easily. “I knew your father years ago and
I’ve just called to see him on a little matter
of business. And how are you?”
Templeton watched Mirah smiling at
Helen, the girl bending to take her mother’s
hand, and even in his wretchedness he noticed
the one likeness between them, the magnolia
whiteness of skin that each possessed.
“You’re a sweet girl, my dear, Mirah
went on. “It must be a great thing for your
father to have a daughter like you.
“I hope so,” Helen laughed, “I’m the only-
one he has. But I mustn’t interrupt you—
Daddy says I have a genius tor wasting
time.” ,
A moment later she was gone. Ahe old
room seemed vibrant with her young \oiee,
now lilting somewhere in the upper story
as she called “Peter! Peter. ler w
heels pattered over the polished floors ; a
scampered along the balcony, barking joy-
ouslv; then tliero wfts & tense silence.
“So that’s my daughter,” Mirah said
slowly. “She looks a nice girl. I’m not going
to get sentimental about her. I never pre-
tended I liked children any age. And she s
very likely soaked with your superior ideas.
But that won’t stop her helping me when
she knows I’m her mother.”
“What arc you going to do?” Templeton
asked. The hand that toyed with the paper-
knife trembled, and he was conscious ot a
faint tremor in his voice. . . .
“Never you mind,” said Mirah, rising and
taking up the suitcase. “I’m going to walk
back to the Station now.” .
“Remember,” said Templeton, opening the
study door, “the allowance ceases.”
“If Alf and I get this business it 11 be
worth ten times your paltry allowance,'
said Mirah fiercely. “You that spend hun-
dreds on that other woman and wont give
your girl’s mother a helping hand! 1
suppose you call it blackmail or something.
Oh, I know you can’t legally be made to
pay me a penny. Don’t’ rub that in. I m sick
of hearing about your generosity. 1 m going
to try something else.” .
“Let me call a taxi,” Templeton said as
she passed into the hall.
“Don’t bother,” said Mirah, I don t want
any of your taxis or private cars.
Then she was gone, her feet crunching tie
gravel of the drive. From the front study
window Temple her as she passed
between the oleander bushes, one shoulder
bent with the weight of the heavy suitcase,
her amazing liair catching the sunlight under
the black hat. , . , ,
A stir outside the other window roused
him The little car, with Helen at the
wheel and Peter balancing on the running-
board, shot out of the side gate, passed in
blue flashes beneath the poplars in the leafy
lane, and then turned down the white road
in tlie direction Mirah had taken. Una
distant corner the car drew level with
Mirah, who paused, apparently at Helen s
call. Then Helen jumped out and deftly
fitted the heavy case on the luggage carrier.
Mirah seated herself in the car, the girl
slipped behind the steering-wheel, and in Uie
yellow afternoon sunlight they drove away.
Templeton walked out into the garden, which
was warm and fragrant in the low sunshine ,
bees still droned in the scented borders, long
shadows lay in quivering bands on the grass,
and the perfume of the honeysuckle watted
to him in cool drifts. This late summer
afternoon had seen the crash of what had
become an obsession with him, the idea that
Helen must not know the truth about Mirah.
So carefully had the secret been guarded
that many of Dorothea’s relatives did not
know that Helen was not her own child,
and he had all her life sheltered the girl
from the blow she would suffer, had prob-
ably suffered by now. She must learn the
truth some time, he had admitted, but not
yet, not while she was emerging from child-
hood, with no cloud over her serene young
horizon. Wliat had made the girl follow
Mirah? he asked himself as he paced the
drive. A whim ? Some curious instinct'
That intuition that always guided her to
the troubled and forlorn —only that morning
he had noticed a strange dog with a ban-
daged paw in the wood-shed? There was
nothing to do but wait.
In the rising wind the aspen-tree rustled
again, but now the soughing, of the slender
boughs had an almost derisive note.
It was some time, almost an hour, before
the blue car turned into the long white
road. When it had passed tlie gate Temple-
ton went into the study and seated himself.
Still there was nothing to do but wait. In
a few minutes Helen would come in, a
changed Helen, probably reproachful, hurt
with the deception, possibly merely broken-
hearted. She was coming along the passage
now. He steeled himself to meet her.
In the girl’s troubled face he read the
realisation of his fear. She seated herself
opposite him, and for a moment did not
“Daddv,” she said with a catch iu hei
soft voice, “did you see me pick up that
poor woman you had in here?”
“Yes,” he said with dry lips.
“She’s had such dreadful trouble, ’ Helen
went on “She told me all about it. Her
husband’s lame and can’t work and now
she has to work for them both.”
She paused, looking eagerly at him. “I
wish I could help her. I did offer her all
the monev I had with me, but she wouldn't
take it. She said it was enough to have me
with her for a little while. Have you known
her long, Daddy?”

Templeton’s brain was awhirl. Did she
know? Was she giving him an opportunity
to tell her?
“I knew her a long time ago,” he
said. “What made you think of driving her
to the station y ’
I looked out of the window,” said Helen
slowly, and saw her going down the drive
with that suitcase, looking sc awfully tired,

said lightly. “Yes she has haY ,' haiftime
Asa matter of fact, 1 have been giving
her a little help, and I’m going to continue
it.”
Helen jumped up. “You darling” she
said. “You are always doing things for
people. And Mrs. Brown—she told mo her
name—must have been beautiful once, when
you first knew her. And now I must rush
out and collect mother at the club.”
The door clicked, then opened to permit
Helen’s eyes to look round.
“Of course I forgot the really important
part, the business part. She—Mrs. Brown
—gave me a message for you. I was to
tell you she had decided differently about
the matter she saiv you on this afternoon,
Everything would be as you wished. Do you
understand that—she said you would?”
“Quite,” said Templeton.
Then he heard her calling Peter in the
yard, and the honk of the car at the cross-
roads.
, “Everything would be as you wished.”
Even Miran was now in the conspiracy to
diiold the girl. The allowance—of course
that would go on. Something in his heart
began to say “All’s well, all’s well,” rapidly
and repeatedly. '
The sunset, glow was yellowing the sky
when Dorothea and Helen drove into the
sidts garden, smiling and waving to him as
he watched them from the window. Then
Dorothea went into the house while Helen
ran the car round to the garage, Peter, Avitli
red tongue lolling, still on the running-board.
In the dim garage the girl opened the
car-door, and Peter sprang on to the seat,
to feel Helen’s arms round him and her
hands pressing his shaggy head against her.
“Oh Peter, Peter,” said the girl, "I’m
going to tell you something. You're the
only one I can tell, Peter. I saw my mother
to-day—my real mother. And nobody’s going
to tell me about her, Peter. They all want
to protect me, but I’ve known for years,
Peter —a horrid girl at school told me ages
ago, so I knew it must happen some day,
and it happened to-day, Peter. And the dear
things, all of them, daddy and mother and
my own poor mother, they all think I don’t
know. You’re the only one avlio knows all
about it, Peter.”
Peter ran a warm, scarlet tongue over
Helen’s clasping hands, where two warm
tears had fallen, and thudded a stumpy tail.
“Of course, Peter, of course you under-
stand. Now wp must be very merry and
bright, you and I, Peter. Come along! I
kissed my mother' at the station, Peter, And
even then she didn’t tell me. Now bark,
Pete, bark your enr-splitl ingest, loudest
bark!”
A moment later Templeton, still at '.he
window, saw the girl and dog coming along
the grassy path, Peter jumping for Helen’s
blue hat, and she, teasing him delightedly,
tossing it overhead and deftly catching it as
she walked.
The laughing girl, the excited dog, moved
him strangely.
Into life had returned all the old sweet-
ness.
The rustle of the aspen-tree was soft as a
benison.
He was not a man of impulse, but he
turned and crossed quickly to the table.
Then, in the waning light, he sat looking
with a great peace in his heart at something
before him, his signature wet on a cheque
for three hundred pounds.
The Parson's Punch.
HAROLD MERCER'S
STORY OF HOW “CHILLER THE SMOODGE" GOT THE
PARSON A HEARING.
RELIGION,” said Chiller the Smoodge,
“ ’as got to ’ave a puneii behind it.”
The meeting had surprised me. It
was hard to believe my eyes when I saw my
old-time, good-naturedly lawless friend, grown
rotund and now well dressed, talking with
a clergyman at the corner of the street. Only
the greeting he gave me as I passed assured
me that it really was Chiller. I had not
gone many yards, however, before he was
by my side, hailing me.
“It was no good asking the parson to
have a drink,” said Chiller as we had ours.
“ ’E’s up ag’in the Demon, an' don't believe
in puttin' it down this way.”
“You look as if you’re doing well,” I re-
marked.
“Too right! Git an eyeful of this,” said
Chiller. From a prosperous-looking pocket-
ease h e extracted a card, which he thrust
towards me. “Mr. Charles Crowther, J.P.,”
was printed on it, with a line in the corner
telling the world that the. man I had known
as Chiller the Smoodge had a business of his
own.
“I'm a bloomin’ J.P., y’see,” he said with
a touch of pride. “I represent lor-an’-order
now. . Y'see, I struck the idea that the rabbit-
skin ’ad more in it than the rabbit. There
was a 'ot demand for skins during the war,
so 1 gits on to the idea; an’ now I’m a dealer
in skins, all sorts. An’ I’ve settled down
with a missus an’ kids to look after.”
“How is the missus?” I asked.
“She’s tiptop—and the same one,” he said
with a twinkle in his eye which showed that
he remembered days when too much success
with the ladies earned him the title of “The
Smoodge,” and some magisterial censure.
‘When I began to take meself serious as a
citizen,” he said, “I joined up the Labber
League, and I’m vice-president now. And
a J.P.,” he added.
“With parsons as your personal friends,”
I suggested.
“That bloke I was speakin’ to? Oh, he’s
a good sort! Rev. Ezra Fowler.”
“Not the man who started the street mis-
sion ?”
“Him! Don’t look the sort of bloke to
take on a fightin’ game, does ’e? Poppin’
with enthoosiasm, though, was Mister Fowler
when he started.
“Y’see, _ ’ow I met the parson -was through
bein’ a big man with the Labber League. ’E
came erlong and joined the league, an’
wanted to open us up with prayer, an’ when
e was turned down ’e kept cornin’ erlong
with the idea ag’in. It’s funny when you
think of it, discussin’ whether meetin’s should
be opened with prayer at the North Surry
Ills League! Though I ain’t sayin’ they
may not be needin’ it.
“Ezra alius got a good ’earing. Even the
blokes that was Cartlielicks an’ ’ad a nacheral
grouc-h ag’in ’im reckernised ’e meant well,
an’ admired ’im. Don’t know whether you
fcnow, but ’e was well off, an’ ’e ’ad done
well at scholarin’ an’ could ’ave got a good
church billet anywhere, but ’c reckons it’s
his duty to come to Surry ’llls an’ start ’is
mission, an’ get jobbed by drunks when ’e
•starts preachin’ on the street corners. Apart
from that, ’e done a lot of good with ’is
money ; an’ if there was any trouble ’e’d
butt in. Not with ’is fists —cripes, ’e
never knew* fists was made for punchin’ jors !
Yet I’ve ’card of ’im standin’ up ag’in a
fightin’-drunk ’usband an’ calmin’ things
down.
“Yes, we got to like ’im. I went down to
see ’im once in the old place ’e’d turned into
a mission ’ouse: wanted ter chat ’im about
a selection ballot that was cornin’ off.
Although ’e belonged to the League, it was
only jest to show that ’is ’eart was with
Labber; ’e wouldn’t think nothin' of politics,
religion bein’ ’is lay; an’ I wanted to get ’is
vote against Commernists —the blokes,”
Chiller added with a touch of heat. “ ’oo
reckon that a bloke like me, jest because ’e’s
built up a bit of a business, is a catterpillist
an’ a’ enemy of the people.
“The door of ’is 'ouse was alius open;
there was a room there where anyone wantin'
shelter could drop in an’ get a bite. I went
parst the swing-door that shut oft - the end
of the ’ouse to the room where I knew I’d
find ’im. But I pulls up at the door, ’earin’
voices.
“ ‘Ezra, give it up!’ I ’card a woman’s
voice saying, with tears in it. It was a
young woman, I could telh ‘They will only
kill you.’
“ ‘Millie,’ ’e said —he had a surprisin' voice
fer a man of ’is size—‘l ’ave Christ’s work
to do. The well-to-do parishes can do with-
out me; ’ere is a place where there is real
work. I ’ave put my ’and to the plough and
cannot turn back. It may be unfair to you.
dear, to ask you to wait; if your ’eart can-
not give you patience, and I must lose
you’
“‘Don't talk like that, Ezra! There is
nobody else I could possibly marry,' she
said. ‘But it all seems so ’opeless.’
“ ‘The waiting may not be as long as you
think,’ ’e says. ‘Within a year my work
must ’ave some effect. I will ’ave changed
sufficient of the people to alter the ’ole dis-
trict, and make it a safer place fer people
to live in. Then we will build our ’ouse
’ere an’ get married an' come an’ live amongst
my people.’
“I ’eard ’er with a rush of sobbin’ plead-
in’ with ’im. and ’im saying ‘Millie, you must
not tempt me!' an’ I got away. It didn’t
seem no moment to talk about politics; but,
curious-like, I ’ung round to get an eyeful
of the tab. When I saw, as they come out,
what ’e was ’oldin’ off with the idea of
doin’ ’is duty, I got a bit more respect fer
’im, ’owever much of a fool I thought ’im.
“After that, whenever I met ’im, I slung
off a bit about ’is ’opeless job, but all ’e
says is that the ’artier the task the greater
the victory. When ’e says that, ’e ’ad a
bandaged ’ead where a rock ’ad ’it ’im, so
I suggests that I might get a coupler John
"Ops along to lay doggo near ’is meetin’s
in case ’e come in fer any rough-’ouse. ’An’
then, be cripes,’ I says, ‘we’d give ’em rough-
’ouse and put the fear o’ God into ’em.’
“ ‘Mister Crowther,’ ’e says, ‘you can’t put
the fear of God inter people’s ’carts that
way. You can only do it by peace an’
gentleness; if I did not think those things
would prevail, rather than vi’lence, I would
be discouraged.’
“The parson meets a bit more trouble some
time after that. There’s ’arf a dozen men
lounging at the street corner, an’ ’e pulls
up with ’is usual ‘l’d like fo ’ave a few
words with you, men.’ It happened that
Smasher Riley was in the outfit. On the
average a bully don’t git much show 7 in
Aussie. In other countries—Amuriky for
one—you ’ear of one man standin’ out an’
makin’ everybody else’s life an ’ell until an
’ero comes along game ter stousli ’im. They
don’t stand fer that ’ere. The way I figure
it is this. There’s a bad an’ a good side to
everything. The ’abit of the Aussie push
of gittin' tergether an’ dealing out stousli
ain t nothin ter bc admired. It’s cowardly
perhaps ; but it’s that trick of orgernisin’ that
keeps tlier bully out in Aussie: an’, let me
tell yer, it was the same thing that ’elped
the Diggers to pull so well together in the
war.”
Having delivered this philosophic digres-
sion with a flourish, Chiller picked up his
story.
“Smasher was a natural bullv. and pro-
bably all the more because V darsen’t use
is talent on the mob, ’e looked upon the
parson as an ’Eaven-sent opportunity
‘Cut it!’ ’e says. ‘We don’t want none
ot you psalm-smging ’ R ’ore.’
~ “ Tlie parson, only stoppin’ an’ lookin’ at
im a moment, goes on, although Smasher ’as
stepped right over to ’im, threatenin’
“Didn’t you ’car me speak, blarst ver - ’
says Smasher—l m givin' ’im the benefit of
ther doubt on the language.

Heed that
Backache!
Too often it indicates kidney weakness
'^/ r HY risk kidney breakdown? Those pains in
the back, dizzy attacks, rheumatic twinges,
and annoying bladder irregularities warn you of
kidney weakness. Never neglect such symptoms;
they are often the start of stone formation; in-
flamed bladder, rheumaism, dropsy, sciatica or
lumbago. Be healthy! Strengthen the weakened
kidneys with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
Thousands owe their good health to the curative
and preventive properties of this kidney medicine.
SYDNEY MAN TELLS HIS STORY.
Mr. H. Holder, 44 Chiltern Road, Willoughby, Sidney, says:—
"Doan’s Backache Kidney Bills arc indeed a wonderful kidney
medicine. I have proved this. For a long time l suffered agony
from backache and kidney trouble, and only those who have been
afflicted in this way have any idea what I went through. My
limbs swelled considerably, the kidney secretions were thick and
cloudy with a red sediment, and I had agonising pains in my back.
I was treated by a doctor, and tried all sorts of remedies, but
nothing gave me the slightest relief. I was naturally very worried
about the serious state of my health, and when Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills were brought under my notice I decided to try them.
It was a grand thing for me that I got this remedy, for seven bottles
cured me completely. I cannot speak too highly of Doan’s Pills
and recommend them with every confidence to other sufferers.”
Ten years later Mr. Holder says:—“l have still the same good opinion
of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They cured me of kidney disorder
10 years ago, and I have had no return of the complaint since.”

“ ‘Oh, nark it, Smasher!’ says the boys.
‘The parson’s not a bad coot.’
“But, you see, the parson wasn’t one of
flier mob, an’ none of ’em reckoned it worth
while ter buy a fight with Smasher.
“ ‘My friend,’ says my reverend, not flinch-
ing, ‘the work I have been appointed ter do
I must do, an’ your threats will not stop
me.’
“ ‘Perhaps that will then,’ says Smasher.
“Smasher’s a ’uge brute, an’ ’e didn’t
trouble ter make the blow light. The parson
went crashin’, and lay there; but when a
couple of flu' boys, defyin’ Smasher, went
to lift ’im up an’ 'elp ’im ’ome, ’e says, ‘No.
lads, thanks; I must not give in. i must
speak, especially to this misguided man.’
“And there ’e was, facing the bully with
the blood runnin’ down ’is jor.
“ ‘Want some more, eh?’ says Smasher,
looking for a new chance. ‘You just clear
off right away or T’ll plug you again. An’
any night I see yer ’ere.’
“ ‘I shall be ’ere tor-morrow at this time,’
says the parson calmly. ‘An’ I shall stay
to-night to’
“ ’E’s saved by someone calling ‘Nit!
’Ops!’ An’ the ’ole crowd melts. The ’ops
is me and Sergeant O’Brien, ’oo 1 ’appen
to’ve met an' walked erlong with, O’Brien
being a personal friend, ’aving lumbered me a
coupler times back in the old diff'rent days.
It was lucky we arrived; the parson was
sick and groggy with tin- blow, but ’o declined
to go to the police station—asked the ser-
geant. as a personal favor, to fergit it—
would ruin 'is mission, V said, if ’e brought
ther penalties of the law in. The upshot
was that the .sergeant leaves 'im ter me,
and I takes the parson into a ’ouse near by
where there was a woman I knew. I was
surprised to see she knew the parson, too.
“ ‘Oh. the brutes—the fighting brutes !’ she
cries when she sees tin; parson’s face, the
fightin’ business bein’ one she ’ad a pertickler
derry on. She bustled round the kitchen,
gettin’ ’ot water to bathe ’is face.
“ ‘I meant to see you before this, Mrs.
’Ayes,’ says the parson. ‘I do ’ope you an’
your husband have made it up.’
“ ‘ ’E knows what to do,’ she says, defiant.
“ ‘Then you ’aven’t,’ ’e says regretfully.
‘l’m sorry. Your husband is really a fine
man.’
“ ‘ ’E’s one of the finest blokes I know,’ I
says.
“ ‘Then why doesn’t he get a decent job?’
she asks.
“ ‘But he has work,’ says the Reverend
Ezra, surprised. ‘Nothing could have been
more sincere than the way lie came along
to me and asked me to get you to take that
money. There were tears in his eyes as he
told me you wouldn’t take it from him.
It showed that he cared.’
“ ‘ ’E’s so stubborn,’ said Mrs ’Ayes. ‘’E
promised me before we married Vd give all
that up; an’ ’e goes back to it. ’E knows
that if ’e gives it up ’is ’ome’s waitin’; but
■ though you talked me into doin’ it, Mister
Fowler, I don’t like ever taking money ’e
gets from that place. I’d sooner work fer
me own.’
“ ‘But it’s not dishonest,’ said the parson,
’oldin’ his ’ead over the dish whilst she
bathed the blood off. ‘An’ I think you
really love him, too.’
“ ’E looked searchin’ly up at ’er. an’ she
turned 'er ’ead away. ’E took the cloth
gently from ’er ’and, an’ she ’opped it into
the scullery. 1 could see the tears glistenin’
as she went.
“ ‘Pity they don’t make it up. I’ve fried
my best,’ lie whispered.
“ ‘Wimmen’s a stubborn lot,’ I whispered
back, an’ then, to change ther subject, I
arsked ’im about givin’ the missionin’ up.
“ ‘Wliat these blokes want,’ I says, ‘is a
bloke like that fightin’ parson ’Ulton Sams.
You’ve go ter ’ave a two-fisted religion
preacliin’ in these parts.
“ 'I think my way will prove best,’ ’e says,
’is bruised and puffed face twistin’ as 'e
smiled. ‘Wliat I am preachin’ is a religion
of gentleness an’ goodwill, an’ I think Y
will prevail. There can be no room f<> ■
vi’lence in it. When I go along to-mor w
night’
“‘You’re not goin’ along to-morro r I
says.
“ ‘Certainly I am,’ he says, like a rat-leap.
‘I said I would. And I will—night after
night.’
“ ‘I wish I ’ad ’Ulton Sams to bring with
you !’ I says.
“That’s the idea I carries away with me
—if I could only find a fightin’ parson
amongst the crowd in Sydney wlio’d come
along with a good ’ard fist ter ’tip a cobber!
An’ then I strikes the idea.
Smasher Riley was along at the same
spot with tlier mob the following night. It
looked as if the neighbor’ood was prepared
ter fun ; there was more than usual ’angin’
around, and people was siftin’ at their win-
dows, as if they was gran’stands.
Alio ! cries Smasher. ‘lt’s a noo par-
son to-night, eh?’ Th’other bloke’s too broke
up to come, eh?’
, Jf m ,? re ’ ear fi'ien’s,’ says the parson,
ter take the first part of the service My
—ah—colleague is not due for another ’arf-
our, but will, attend in due course/
An I m ere/ I says, ’as sorter chair-
man/
. “ ‘We will commence,’ says the parson, ‘be
singin an ’ymn you must know”—
“‘Oh, will we !’ cried Smasher. ‘I said
larst night we didn’t want no psalm-singin’
blankards ore, and my word’s goin’ ter go.’
, “‘^ e sing: ’’ says the parson calmly
'Onward, Christian Soldiers.” I know the
words brothers; perhaps you would like the
ymn-book.’
“He offered it to Smasher, who snatched
it an flung it to the ground. ‘Get out!’ he
roars, with a swing at the parson.
“To his surprise the swing was stopped.
‘ Yer will pick up that ’ymn-book,
brother, says the parson quietly.
“‘Like ’Ell I will!’ says Smasher. ‘An'
you get out before you’re ’urt.’
“The parson’s coat was slipped off and
handed to me.
“‘You will pick up that ’ymn-book
brother, says the parson, flickin’ off his
collar an beginnin’ to roll his sleeves
“There was real interest now. The' crowd
a big one had formed a ring; there were
faces at all the windows.
“ ‘Smasher looked queer as V watched the
arms the parson revealed. Still the bloke
was only a parson! TB dived in with a
swing intended to sweep ’im horf the earth.
“That was where the religious edjncation
of Smasher started. The jolt on the nose
that pulled ’im up an’ sent ’is swing no-
where was only the start of it. Not that
the affair was one-sided. Smasher was a
good, wild fighter, an’ got in a few, but the
mill was so willing ’e was groggy an’ very
bloodstained in erbout five minutes.
.“‘’Ad enough?’ says the parson.
“ ‘lt’ll do me,’ growls Smasher. ‘I know
when I’m beat.’
“ ’E turned to go, but the parson tapped
’im on the shoulder.
“ ‘The ’ymn-book, brother,’ 'e says. ‘You
must pick up that ’ymn-book before you go,
brother.’
“‘Go to —- ’Ell!’ snarls Smasher; and
it. started again. But Smasher did pick up
the ’ymn-book.
“ ‘Friends,’ says the parson, ‘I am goin’ to
h ave you now, but 1 have to announce that
the Rev. Ezra Fowler will hi* ’ere shortly,
as ’e promised to ’old his rneetin’. I’d like it
ter be known, though, that I’m ’is colleague
from now on, an’ I’Ll be ’ere again fer any
gen’leman as can’t leave a maff what preaches
peace alone.’
“Mrs. ’Ayes was surprised ter see us.
“ ‘Another parson, missus, ’oo’s been
slightly damaged by one of thor mob
an’ wants ’is face bathed, missus,’ I says.
‘D’you mind?’
“ ‘Why, no,’ she answered. ‘What cow-
ardly beasts those men are!’
“ ‘Y’see, Mrs. ’Ayes, ‘I says, ‘this parson
could look after ’isself a bit better than th’
other one. ’E went erlong ahead—scein’ the
Reverend Fowler was set on turnin’ up ter
be killed—ter make things safe fer ’im.’
, ''We ’ad got out o’ the darkness of the
all into the light of the kitchen, and Mrs.
Ayes, turnin’ round, saw ’oo was at the
back of me.
“ ‘Bill!’ she cried.
“ ‘Well, if ’e ain’t a parson Vs a damn
good actor,’ I grins. ‘’E tells mo ’e’s givin’
oP ( , p Stadium since you’re so keen on it;
an es larst fight, as you might say, was in
the cause of religion.’
‘“Bil l l’,she cries again; and then, ‘Oh,

wasn t wanted.
“ ‘l’ll call ter take that clobber back in

that it was religion with a punch the crowd

The Test.
Beauty, ’ I cried —“Beauty so closely cher-
ished,
Surely she will suffice to the journey’s
end!
Though Love and all Love brings to life
have perished,
Magical colors to earth she still can lend.”
All my youth I followed her bright flags
flying;
Deemed she never would fail me, wor-
shipped so.
Then the dark, as the Best Beloved lay
dying—
Death! and, a mocking splendor, the sun-
rise glow!
And they brought blossoms fresh from the
spring’s soft kisses,
A blinding wonder of beauty richly piled.
Ah, oh ! but the day was lovely with wind-
blown blisses,
Clear and calm as the face of a sleeping
child !
There was no place for my grief, for my
wild grief raging;
And the beauty I lauded —where was her
ancient power?
Ah! she had no healing touch, no sweet
assuaging.
My heart in its tomb is mocked by the
world in flower.
QUEENSLAND.

ADVERTISERS!—
What is needed more than anything else in
Newspaper advertising is “QUALITY.” It is
far better to use one OUTSTANDING medium
which holds the confidence of its readers than
to advertise in several mediocre ones.
FOR THREE GENERATIONS
“THE AGE”
has exerted an influence in the affairs and
development of Victoria. Its present powerful
position has been gained by its literary worth,
which appeals to an intelligent public, and
by its accurate and complete news service.
These factors have a direct bearing upon its
value as an advertising medium and cannot he
disregarded by the advertiser who desires to
obtain the best value for his advertising and
expenditure.
