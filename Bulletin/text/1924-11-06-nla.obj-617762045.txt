The Red Page
Adieu, Anatole! Dormez Bien!
That easy writing makes hard reading is
one of the oldest proverbs; but its reverse,
hard writing makes easy reading, is less true,
for otherwise anybody by simply flogging his
brains could write a “JPenghin Island.” But
strait is the path and narrow is the way that
leadeth to works of genius; many think
themselves to be called, but indeed few are
chosen. Since Anatole France, following in
the path of Ms predecessor Voltaire, began to
ridicule those debased opinions which make
up so much of the life of the herd, how many
disciples have sprung up to copy him, but
upon how few has liis mantle fallen! He
was greater than Voltaire, for Voltaire could
do nothing but scoff. (I know perfectly well
that sometimes his heart melted at the
thought of poor, slighted humanity, as when
he described the little prostitute Paquette in
“Cuudide” ; more often, however, he could do
nothing but destructively criticise.) But. the
heart of Anatole France, for all its seeming
mockery, saw only too well that Man is his
own betrayer, that In l is incessantly fighting
against his own good, that he is constantly
worshipping gods which are no gods, but
which lead him directly into the hands of
the powers of evil.
Qf all the scores of books that bear his
name the most living to me are "The Revolt
of the Angels,” ‘‘Penguin Island” and
“Jerome Coignard.” In "The Revolt of the
Angels” we see that the mighty Jehovah
is nothing but a degraded and barbarous
version of the Demiurge of Plato, and that
the cherubim which eternally sing around
His throne are merely the “masked and
curled Assyrian bulls.” In "Penguin Island”
we learn that virginity is not necessarily
holy: there is only a woman’s word for it
that she is virgin, and it is certainly silly
for a man to make a goddess of a woman
simply because she says she is virgin—in
which most people will see some veiled refer-
ence to the Queen of Heaven. In “Jerome
Coignard” we see Anatole France himself
and a description of the great philosophy
of Epicurus that, like the philosophy of Niet-
zsche, has been so shockingly misrepresented
by the Christian Church to the English
people. Epicureanism was not merely the
gospel of pleasure; that description might
more fairly be given to the Cyrenaic philoso-
phy of Aristippus, which seems to have led
to a mere indolent debauchery. The Epi-
curean philosophy was a high and noble inode
of thought which conceived this world as a
vast of atoms in the void, * atoms driven
hither and thither by causes that they did not
know and probably could never know: the
gods were high above this sinful world and
did not interfere with it. For practical pur-
poses you could sum up Epicureanism in the
Epicurean motto “Live concealed”; that is
to say, divest yourself of empty and super-
stitious fears —live so that a god which
takes no interest whatever in the world
cannot find some excuse for hurting you.
And this philosophy is so amazingly like to
that of the modern scientific world that it
has been said that if Epicurus had hit upon
the idea of variation he would have antici-
pated Charles Darwin. A philosophy which
has consoled some of the noblest minds of the
nineteenth century cannot be altogether bad;
and if. the Church says it is wicked and
atheistical, so much the worse for the Church.
Such as this furnishes a sufficient reason why
the Christian Church is so losing its hold
over the imaginations of mankind; why the
churches are half-empty every Sunday.
The really marvellous thing about Anatole
France w T as that he could keep up years
of good-humored banter' about solemn sub-
jects and yet never wound. This he could
do because he took the utmost possible
trouble over his writing. A recent article
in the American Mercury describes his
methods. He. began by writing the first
thing that came into his head, and by send-
ing this to the printer. When the proofs
were returned came tfie real battle, the real
labor-pains of genius. M. France, scissors
in hand, would shift sentences about and in-
sert or delete words, until paragraphs began
to take on that appearance of kindly ban-
ter of mankind, including himself, that was
so characteristic of Anatole France. When
the proofs were finally revised no person
on earth but his lady-secretary could make
head or tail of them, and it was she who
did the actual typing for the printer.
Whether the work was harder for him or for
her is a matter of opinion ; but there can be
no doubt that between them they produced
some of the most delicate and delicious writ-
ing that has ever been achieved. This alone
makes it almost impossible to translate him
into English as perfect as his French. We
can render the outside of his meaning, its
coarse, physical appearance; but it is im-
possible to get its soul, the continual sly
banter at customary things which was the
very essence of everything that the Master
wrote;
Naturally those people who were con-
vinced, because their mothers had told them,
that there was a Father in HeaVen who
loved them, were deeply indignant at Anatole
France for reminding them that a silly,
old Hellenistic philosopher had said that in
all probability He did not care a rap about
their insignificant selves; and so they abused
both Anatole and his philosopher, calling
them wicked, indecent, immoral and atheis-
tical. But the probability is that when we
all come to die it will be found that the true
believers will not die more happily, better
resigned to the inevitable than the kindly
old Frenchman who had the courage to see

Hoffmann of the “Tales”
_ We have no satisfactory English transla-
tion, and it is to be feared that very few
who have seen him as a hero of opera ktow
much of his work or anything of his person-
ality. It is to be regretted; for as a writer
he has a double interest —for his originality
and his influence —and as a man he shows
amazing vitality and versatility. His friends
put on his tombstone the words: “Praise-
worthy as official, as writer, as painter, as
musician.” It can hardly have happened
to another man, outside his double career as
official and man of letters, to have been
the composer of two operas and the hero ot
a third, the composition of which marked the
fiftieth year of his profound and enduring
influence on a foreign literature. That
opera, it is true, does not attempt to give the
real Hoffmann, either as writer or as man;
it stresses in the former the "romantic, in
the latter the “Bohemian,” and both as. they
appealed to the French romantic generation of
1830-40. The actual Hoffmann, it is
true, was given to wine and good company;
and like that last of the romantics, Villiers
de l'lsle-Adam, he “puffed away” many a
brilliant idea over the cups in the all-night
sessions in the Cape wine-cellar of Berlin.
But, for all that, he was, if not a model
home-and-family man, at least married, and
he had too much practical sense to make
literature his “crutch.” Had it not been
for the chance that he was one of the Prus-
sian officials dispossessed by Napoleon’s cre-
ation of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, he
might never have won repute as a musician.
It was during his years of wandering in
search of a settled occupation that he took
over the management of the Bamberg opera,
and found presently that he must not
merely compose, rehearse, stage-manage and
conduct, but paint the scenery as well. As
soon as he could he got back to the public
service, and filled a high position to the day
of his death. It was rather work and pro-
longed cerebral excitement than any “weak-
ness” that carried him away at 45. Fourteen
volumes are witness to that.
His work, at first sight, would seem the
very opposite of that which we might expect
from a personality and career such as here
indicated ; it would rather justify the writers
of the “Tales of Hoffmann” libretto. It
might well be characterised by the title
which Poe invented for his own, “Tales of
the Grotesque and Arabesque.” Of pure
imagination, of clear poetic effect, no trace,
but a continual clash of the fantastic and
the absurd; of composition or design, equally
none, but an inextricable tangle of discon-
certingly unconnected threads. Neither
human life nor human character the stuff
in which he worked; but beside the mete,
craziness of fairy-business and witchcraft,
either a morbid pre-occupation with the
night-side of nature—as the fashionable
phrase then ran—and morbid psychology, or
extravagant caricature of the harmless and
necessary Philistine. How can such a writer
have exercised a profound influence in a
country like France, and how can he be of
any value to us?
Certainly all that is urged against him is
true. He lacks the highest qualities, both of
imagination and of execution. Not having
the gift of poetry, he cannot attain any-
where to that perfection which Poe has
achieved within the narrow range of his
tales. Nor does In' cbmpensate for his
failure to be a “classic” in his special kind
by any “objective” element outside it ; when
he aims at realistic effect he is dull. But
catchwords settle nothing; for the reason of
Hoffmann’s undoubted value and influence
we must look past the surface of his work.
Its essence and its meaning are a discord
aud a conflict —a discord in liis own nature,
a conflict between the two orders of experi-
ence which were always both at once vividly
present to him,' without either submitting
itself to the control of the other. It *is
notable how in all his most significant works
the central fabulous character is a quaint,
grotesque person—like the Archivarius Lind-
liorst in the “Golden Bowl,” with his
withered body and uncannily piercing eyes
—who, all at once, to the vision of a chosen
one or few, can reveal himself as an august
visitant from a world of faery. And how,
again, the young enthusiast to whom such
glimpse has been vouchsafed, does, 1 with his
sane and sober friends, come under sus-
picion of insanity or something more cul-
pable. It is the difference between Hoffmann
as he saw himself in the mirror and through
the eyes of others and as he dreamed of him-
self over the glass or in the inspired mood—
he suffered from it all his life; l it is the
conflict between his intense—-nay, paroxystic
—endeavor to conceive pure beauty and the
perpetually intruding sense of the common
ugliness of things. For he had —and this
is the enigma of him—though no poet, yet
more than many a professed poet, a deep
and abiding. sense of the ultimate harmony
and perfection of the universe, something
more positive than a mere yearning for
what he calls “the realm of the lost Atlantis.”
But the vision always baffled him, for it was
continually jostled by the painful pressure
of the vulgarity which he could not but
feel; nor could the actual, so experienced,
become to him a symbol of the vision. That
synthesis, which his predecessors in roman-
ticism had descried as the far-off goal of a
new art, being impossible of achievement, he
had to acquire in the mutual distortion of
its two elements under the stress of their
obstinate feud; the vision becomes the mere
fantastic, the actual the grotesque. The
clash of these two, the bewildering shift from
one to the other, are the stuff of his w r ork;
and once we grasp this we recognise his
mastery within the limits from which he
could not escape. But escape he sought—
in the idea that poetry and art, in so far as
they express an aspiration towards harmony,
perfection and beauty, are a consolation and
a refuge. Therewith he brought pessimism
into the very conception of art and left
a dangerous legacy to the modern world.
Within 10 years of his death Hoffmann,
thanks to a good translation, was famous
in Paris. The best illustrators—Gavarni,
Tony Johannot—devoted their talent to him
equally with the French romantics of their
time. A tale by the young Gautier, “Mis-
haps of an Admirer of Hoffmann,” with its
transference of Hoffmann’s world to a (sup-
posedly) real person, may be the suggestion
of the operatic theme; as before said, the
operatic “hero” Hoffmann dates from that
period. With the arrival of the next roman-

DAVID JONES’
OP P. G. P. O.— for Service—S YDN E Y
tic generation we have the spirit of Hoffmann
absorbed and his influence works more pro-
foundly. Baudelaire recognises the parox-
vstic strain in him; and the title of a great
part of his own poetry, Spleen and Ideal,
expresses a dualism of which Hoffmann may
have helped him to become conscious, akin to
that of Hoffmann, though the terms are dif-
ferent. With Flaubert, the dualistic pessi-
mism of art is at its height. There is one
consolation for the infliction of life, and in
Flaubert’s practice that has two aspects—
imaginative debauch or ironic vengeance on
life by devoting a highly wrought style to
the presentation of its squalid futility. I>u
in Flaubert’s case the imagination required a
pile of documents, and at last the actual over-
powered him; the result was a grim nihilism.
The influence at work here is. Hoffmann s.
Schopenhauer had worked out his metaphysi-
cal-artistic pessimism just before the deacli
of Hoffmann, who of course did not read
him. And his influence does not begin, in
Germany until the ’sixties, abroad until tne
'eighties. By that time Flaubert was dead
and “Contes d’ Hoffmann” had appeared.
CHRIS. BRENNAN.
The Twentieth-Century Theatre
“Some things are beyond argument,” says
Prank Vernon in The Twentieth-Century
Theatre (Harrap and Co.), “and it is not to
be questioned that since the Elizabethan out-
burst no such number of the right play-words
has ever been written and spoken in England
as during the pre-war years of the twentieth
century.” Somewhat in the style of Sir
Oracle, this; yet it must be admitted that
the author makes out a strong case. "We
may,” he continues, “differ about the indi-
vidual merit of this play and that, but as to
the collective merit of the drama of this our
great post-Elizabetlian period, there is no
disputing.” Then came the war and the
tires were damped down. “War,” says John
Drinkwater, who writes a preface to the
volume, “didn’t damage only the drama; it
soiled the playhouses: it raped them. But
the flapper didn’t care; nobody cared.” Since
the cessation of hostilities —one hesitates to
call it the return of peace—the drama has
been occupied in putting its outraged house
in order.
When Mr. Vernon speaks of right play-
words he means literature that is not litera-
ture alone —as we find in many closet plays
—but literature combined with dramatic fit-
ness : specialised literature, standing the
literary test and also the test of dramatic
expression. At the back of these require-
ments, providing the means of expression,
lies the field of dramatic thought. At the
close of last century the writing on the wall
to prophesy the wonderful re-birth of a drama
rich in idea, fit and apt in expression, was
faint indeed. The ’nineties were not without
some share of outstanding drama, such as
came from the pens of Pinero and Henry
Arthur Jones, Shaw and Barrie being then
in apprenticeship; “but generally they
marked the darkest hours before the dawn,
and he would have been a very sanguine
prophet who could have foretold, out of the
evidence in sight, such a dramatic renas-
cence as was about to come.” If the time
had arrived for a swing of the pendulum,
“it was not bound to swing so high; it was
not bound to give us—it was bountiful and
amazing that it did give us—beside the
mature Shaw and the mature Barrie, drama-
tists like Barker, Hankin, Masefield, Gals-
worthy. Synge, Houghton, Brigliouse and
Chapin.” It may have been that unless our
English drama were to fall into complete
decadence there must be an upward lift
from the average stuff of the ’nineties; “but
the mass and variety of the new drama
made it a thing to marvel at.” The great
period opened in 1902 with the production
of Barrie’s “The Admirable Crichton” and
ended, surviving into the war, with “Hob-
son’s Choice” in 1916. These two plays,
Mr. Vernon thinks, definitely ushered in and
definitely closed a historic period of British
drama. Among the characteristics of this re-
nascence the spirit of social criticism was con-
spicuous. This attribute accurately reflected
its time. The plays of the ’nineties, with
perhaps the exception of Pinero’s “Mrs.
Tanqueray,” either refused or failed to do
so: but with the young life of the early days
of the new century came an intense spirit
of criticism of things as they are. Plays
such as John Galsworthy’s “Silver Box,”
“Strife” and “Justice,” like Barrie’s “Admir-
able Crichton,” raised questions about social
problems. The theatre was at last open
to the expression of current discontent, and
the dramatist as the mirror of his time
expressed it in terms of his art. But it was
no function of that art to offer a solution.
Where he ignored this limitation he courted
failure—the almost inevitable fate of propa-
gandist drama. Even of Shaw it may be said,
generally, that in his plays cases are stated
without propaganda, the Shavian gospel be-
ing kept for his characteristic prefaces.
Another marked quality of this period, and
one on which Mr. Vernon lays stress, is that
its plays emphasised the importance of the
right play-word. “Since Wilde, words in
the theatre had grown sloppy because they
were uncared for.” It was deemed sufficient
if they were theatrically effective, a result,
perhaps, of pure heedlessness. “It is note-
worthy that Sir Arthur Pinero, who made
his people talk telegraphese in the ’nineties,
has overhauled his dialogue and to-day gives
his characters believable conversation.”
If Barrie launched the new drama it re-
mained to the Court Theatre to establish it.
That theatre’s main inheritance from the
close of the last century was the mature
Bernard Shaw. “John Bull’s Other Island,”
“Man and Superman” and others of his plays
were first produced there. Of the Shavian
plays, in about half of them “Shaw is every-
man’s dramatist, and in the other he
is distinctly the dramatist of the man who
listens.” His plays are not always shapely,
hut his words are the right words. With
ideas that were “irrepressible” he permitted
himself to do what would not be permissible
iii dramatists of lesser note. His plays, if
sometimes void of shape, are always great,
whereas those of his imitators have neither
shape nor greatness.. Mr. Vernon regards
him as “first a great dramatist and second
the boldest, most fruitful, most original
thinker of our times.” He hastens to check
any murmur of dissent from this lather sui
charged eulogy by adding: “That la why
stupid people do him the honor to regard
him as a public nuisance.”
With the financial failure of the Gourt
Theatre the production of serious drama be-
came decentralised, but its growth continued
unchecked. Tribute is rendered to the good
work of Masefield —whose “Nan” is a pas-
sionate tragedy full of action for the„ eye,
and beautiful in words for the ear to
Granville Barker. St. John Hankin mid
others. The production of “Peter Fan in
1904 is described as “the finest* flower
of the children’s theatre. Sliaw had the
larger gallery and the wider intellectual
scope, hut he had no individual creaticms of
the stature of Bill Crichton and Peter Pmi.
An interesting chapter is devoted to lhe
Case of the One-act Play,” and the author
places Synge’s “Riders to the Sea as the
greatest one-act play of modern times. Alfred
Sutro and Stanley Houghton, among others,
did good work in this direction. But. as a
whole, the one-act play is not regarded seri-
ouslv in England ; it has not yet overcome
confusion with the old Victorian curtain-
raiser. “Recognition of the art of the one-
act play has certainly come in America,
he says. “Suit in England it has come so
little that the writing of one-act plays is
regarded with contempt, or, at least, as an
amiable idiosyncrasy which authors. who can
afford to waste time may indulge if it pleases
them.” „ ,
The devastation of the art of the theatre
caused by the war, when “the flappers” took
possession, has left its traces; but there are
signs that the degeneracy of wholesome
humor, and fun that is not vulgarity, into
coarse and suggestive buffoonery is on the
wane. “The flapper theatre is,” Mr. Vernon
declares, “plainly in decline; the civilised
theatre is plainly in the ascendant, and drama
as the characteristic artistic expression of
our times puts up a winning fight against
its only possible coif.petitor, the novel.”

“Various Verse”
A man said to me the other day that The
Bulletin ought to set apart a column to
explain the contents of “Various Verse.” The
remark was interesting as a confession of
inability to grasp simple thought set out m
rhythmic form. The word of a great English
poet to a great English Chief Justice, who
had complained of the obscurity of the other s
work, might meet such a case : “I suppose, my
Lord, I should be gratified if a man of your
calibro understands on(Y-tenth of what I
write.” But that answer might seem harsh;
for the inability to understand is not neces-
sarily due Jo intellectual weakness, but
more often to intellectual warp. A good
deal of modern verse contains thought which
it is almost impossible to understand with-
out some kind of key; a good deal contains
obscurities of thought woven in with deli-
berate intent on the general principle that
Strange mysterious dulness, still thy friend,
Admires the theme she cannot comprehend.
But nothing of this. kind is true of the
“Various Verse” which appears in Tite
Bulletin. To those who have the quite
primitive feeling for rhythmic thought—and
this was the earliest form of thought
“Various Verse” is a good deal easier to
understand than anything else which appears
in the paper. Much essential poetry appears
in that column, and much appeal to the
simplest and sweetest of the emotions. The
main reason why some readers cannot grasp
it is because they are looking for something
else —something of a lower standard which
makes a louder noise.
Of course, it must be granted that much
good verse says very little directly, but says
a great deal by suggestion. It may be
merely a sunrise that is described; but if
the writer makes you feel that life and time
and fate are plucking at the skirts of that
sunrise he has done a great deal more than
describe a physical occurrence. As for the
common and thoughtless chatter which dis-
parages a “mere musical arrangement of
words,” let anybody try to arrange words
in a fresh musical context and say nothing
worth while. The whole result may be very
slight; but words are thoughts, and any
arrangement of musical words must convey
some musical thoughts. The great verse
crime is the borrowing of half-understood
musical thoughts from other writers and pre-
senting them in a new pattern, which has
been mechanically stitched together, instead
of weaving a new design on the loom of per-
sonal experience and feeling; but so absor-
bent is memory that there can be no very
hard and fast line between the false and
real. Very few writers steal in verse by
deliberate intent; all build up to some ex-
tent on the remembered music of others.
This is inevitable; for Shakspeare and Keats
are just as much a part of the soul as sight,
experience and remembered emotion. Tenny-
son’s Ulysses was “a part of all that he had
seen,” and in some sense every writer is a
part of all that he has read.
In the main, any charge of obscurity that
can be laid against “Various Verse” can be
laid against all that is greatest in English
poetry. It is perfectly safe ta say that those
who voice this charge do not read poetry
as a source of inspiration and delight. Thou-
sands otherwise reasonably normal openly
express their detestation of all poets and
their work. Fortunately for the world’s con-
tinuing sense of beauty, these people are only
a small minority. There are. of course,
always a few cheap people who sneer at
verse at every opportunity because they
imagine such sneering shows a superior atti-
tude pf mind; but these need be taken no
more seriously than those who sneer in a
similar fashion at art, science or honesty.
But those who have a loving understand-
ing of verse are very numerous; and it is
not from these that any complaint of obscu-
rity comes. Of the same volume of verse I
heard it said in one afternoon : “I read that
book. It seems all right, if I had any notion
what the things are about” ; and: “My little
daughter [ aged 15] read that book all
through her illness. She knows every word
by heart.” The first speaker was an artist
of some ability; the second, a worker on the
outskirts of journalism. Yet the child easily
understood and loved what the artist had
wholly failed to grasp. On the whole, there
is not much wrong with work in which a
young mind finds enough delight to commit to
memory. Similarly with another work, nor
verse, but with something of verse quality.
A literary friend told me he had no idea
what it was driving at; another friend told
me he had read it over and over to his
mother, who would not lose a word of it. In
both cases the work was of the very sim-
plest, yet easily open to the charge of obscu-
rity because to many minds simplicity is the
most difficult thing of all.
As for offering explanations of verse, the
very demand proves the absurdity of the
reader’s attitude. No lyric verse can ever
be capable of prose explanation. If it could
be so explained there would be no excuse for
using verse as a medium. Verse is used be-
cause it says so many things that cannot be
said, or fully said, in any other way. That
is the reason why all lyric translation fails.
The lyric is a growth of the language in
which it is written. Emotion sways to the
chosen sounds of the words; and emotion is
an intellectual process which in cross-play
with thought makes poetry possible. The
person who thinks that cross-play can be ex-
plained is miles away from any conception
of what verse is.

A Satchel of Books
A Motley, by John Galsworthy (Heinemann). A
new edition of some of Galsworthy’s earlier tales,
dating back to 1899. “The Prisoner” is a powerful
study; most are slender, many are full of English
country mellowness.
The Confessions of J. J. Rousseau (Lippincott).
It seems late in the day for a new translation of the
“Confessions,” so delightful in their naive rascality ;
but this one has the advantage of 17 illustrations.
It is in two volumes of very small print and runs
into 717 pages. The cheap French paper edition
issued by Gamier Freres is in one volume, and has
100 pages less. It is also in small type and horribly
printed and bound, as most Italian and French
publications have been since the war. The translation
is fairly accurate; but the translator has thought fit
to make omissions without even warning the reader.
That is one reason why the book should be read in
the original. Rousseau has a fine style, and is an
easy author to read.
Speak Out! by Alexander Watson (Harrap). This
useful little book bears the sub-title- “The Common-
sense of Elocution” ; and nobody is better qualified to
talk about it than Australia’s old friend—how many
tours of this country has he made? He thinks that
“the inclination to cultivate clearness of utterance
has moved in inverse ratio to the spread of education.
It is doubtful whether there has ever been so much
complaint of indistinctness.” “Of what use to a
speaker,” the author asks, “is a clear-cut intellect,
unless he possesses an equally clear-cut enunciation?”
Heaven forbid that our education system should be
used to add to the already excessive number of stump-
orators, but something might be done to keep our
children from mumbling their words through half-
closed lips in slatternly, unordered sequence.
The Treasure of Ho, by L. Adams Beck (Dodd,
Mead). An Englishman born in China gets on the
track of hidden wealth, valued conservatively at
.£170,000,000, buried by an ancestor. Disguised as
a Chinese he penetrates the Court of the famous
Empress Dowager, of Boxer fame, who is busy ex-
terminating foreigners. He accompanies her in her
flight before the victorious (and loot-loving) Allies,
picking up on the way a ravishingly beautiful
Eurasian bride who turns out to be his cousin. After
several thousand feet of breathless incident, they
find the treasure, or part of it, which comes in
useful as a dowry: and they live happily ever
after. For his history, the author is evidently in-
debted to J. O. P. Bland’s fascinating and well-
documented story of the grisly imperial harridan;
and for his mystery to Ossendowski’s two strange
travel books.
Village Sermons, by Gustav Frenssen (Hcffer and
Sons).' “Throughout the world to-day a pang ot
grief is felt in every heart. For many and many a
hundred thousand years the human race lias been
upon the march—a mighty train vyith vultures and
eagles circling overhead. Once mote it halts, stands
bespattered with brothers’ blood, on a vast barren
plain feeling that it has been following the wrong
road,’ bewailing the fact, yet in distress and doub„,
not knowing which road to take. These are the
introductory words of a preface by the German
novelist Frenssen to a volume of his collected cei-
mons. The novelist, as a rule, conceals Ins sermon
in the fabric of his novel. It may wrap itself in
a garb of motley, cover up its tracks with adventure,
and not unfrequently weaves itself into the intimacies
of lovers • but it rarelv shows itself in fiction naked
and unashamed. Frenssen is more frank ; he preaches
openlv. The son of a Lutheran pastor he entered
the Church, but soon its chains chafed him. His
main purpose on entering had been to help men, to
direct their thoughts, to refine their feelings and
fortify their wills. Work within the conventional
limitations of orthodoxy became impossible. He was
an artist and a poet rather than a pastor; neverthe-
less his simple ministry to simple folk left its
impress on his work. Essentially in his case the
style was the man. He was a disciple of bteraiy
simplicity, and found that bis ideal could not be
attained without effort. To reach it he would some-
times write his novels four times ovei. It was
with the publication of “Jorn Uhl” that Frenssen
made his name. Of this novel, a translation of whicn
is well known in England and America, more copies
have been sold in Germany than ot any othei novel
which has appeared in that country. Of course the
Great War had its influence on German as. on English
fiction, and “Der Pastor von Poggsee is in effect
Mr. Brittling seeing it through the spectacles of In
Teuton. The sermons collected m this volume hart,
all the characteristics of the writer—his simplicity
of diction, his intense love of humanity and his force-
ful earnestness.
Red Roses on the Highways, by H. E. Holland
(Holland and Stephenson, Sydney). The writer of
these 40-odd pieces of verse is leader of the Parlia-
mentary Labor Party in Maoriland, and was once a
leading Socialist journalist and agitator in Sydney.
He had ever a gift for happy titles. Politics and
poetry go so rarely together, especially in the Labor
camp, that Holland’s book seems a strange omen.
It is remarkable in that it is in part the product
of hospital and gaol. Otherwise it is born of
election, strike and anti-vftir campaigns, with occa-
sional surcease from the dust and din. It is not in
tune with preconceived impressions to find the verses
almost wholly sentimental. They scan well in the
main and in several instances climb towards Olym-
pus. ’ The Nature pieces, contrary to expectations,
show greater artistry than the revolutionary, though
in the lastnamed category the satire of “patriotism ’
cuts like a naked blade. “My Dream of Peace” may
be cited: —
“I dreamed the days of war were done,
And ended all the carnage red,
And ended all the strife of men:
‘O blessed Peace!’ I, dreaming, said.
“And then T dreamed an awful thing;
* I dreamed that when the men came back
There was no woman in the land
Who was not dressed in deepest black.”
In “Eureka” and other historical excursions, as in-
deed with most of the material, the thought is of
the obvious order. Perhaps the highest note, and the
best expressed, is in “When I am Dead’ :
“When I am dead
Dig me a grave on some high cliff
Whose rock-walls guard a sea-swept shore;
For I have loved the lofty hills
And loved the wide and restless sea;
And all the years of life I’ve known
Were ever lashed by storm and swept
Bv*, lightning flame and driving hail;
And I at close of day would sleep
Where all God's wildest storms of Earth
Shall thunder requiems for me—
When I am dead.”

General Motors car 3 are
world renowned for their
durability. When bodies
have outlived their useful-
ness, engines are used to
furnish power for tram
cars, saw mills, etc. No
matter how old a General
Motors car or engine may
be, moreover, replacement
parts and service are al-
ways available.
The illustration is from
a photograph showing a
General Motors car en-
gine, which, after years of
service, is still furnishing

Which motor car shall I buy?”
WHEN you are thinking of buying a
motor car or truck, you naturally
ask these three questions:
“Is the car of an established make?
Is the company which builds it per-
manent? Throughout the life of my car
shall I be able to get replacement parts
and service?
1. Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Oak-
land, and Oldsmobile motor cars and
GMC Trucks are known and used in
practically every country of the world.
Buick, with its world-wide good name,
has been built for the past 20 years.
Cadillac has set a standard for fine car
construction for 22 years. Chevrolet, 11
years old, is the largest selling com-
pletely equipped car in the world. Oak-
land, the first “light six,” is 17 years old.
Oldsmobile, the first motor car to be
produced in quantity, is 27 years old.
The GMC Truck has been established
for 20 years,
2. Each of these cars is built by a di-
vision of the General Motors Corpora-
tion which is strong in itself, with a long
record of continuous service. And back
of each division are the far greater re-
sources of the parent corporation —Gen-
eral Motors, the largest automotive
manufacturer in the world and one of
the largest industrial organizations.
3. Within the General Motors Cor-
poration are divisions producing stand-
ard parts, accessories and equipment
used in the building of General Motors
cars, so that the owner of a General Mo-
tors car is assured of replacement parts
and maintenance service so long as he
has his car.
Further information regarding General Motors may "be had by writing to
General Motors Export Company, M.U.1.0.0.E. Building, Castlereagh
Street, Sydney; or General Motors Export Company, Bourke House,

From a Tent.
Soft threads of some forgotten lover’s tale,
Rewoven on the looms of memory,
Might match this fabric that so shelters me
From all the rugged fury of the gale.
These flimsy walls awe not nor mock the frail
Uneasy prison of my captive soul
With granite strength, nor shutter out the
roll
Of God’s deep drums resounding down the
vale,
But rather swell the thunders and the fires
That, sweeping on in passion to the plains,
Yet seem to speak of slumberless desires
Conquered and bound in unrelenting chains.
And, listening, my soul throws off its clod
And strides across the vast domain of God.

Oh, Psyche of the shadows which embrace
The couch of death ! Oh, Death with gentle
feet!
They err who prate of rattling bones that
greet
The ear at your approach, your body’s grace
Strip to the vertebrae that shrouds enlace.
They lie who draw you like some monstrous
cheat
Which frights men at life’s end. I know
the sweet,
Still smile that dawns upon your girl-like
face,
When from the eternal lamp your fingers
grasp
Shall spill, as once there fell on Ero’s breast.
One drop of burning oil, a kiss of flame,
Then shall my soul break from the dying
clasp
Of that pale thing that shudders into rest;
And love once more shall call upon your
name.

Wild Asphodels.
Rain and sun, and sun and yain!
Now they light the gloom again
Where the jungle meets the plain,
Wild and blowing asphodels!
To the warm sky high and blue,
From the shadows shining through,
Cleanly vrashcd and painted new,
Shy white sisters, asphodels!
Swords of green are straight and keen,
Blades and scimitars asheen —
Sentinels the blooms between—
Keeping safe the asphodels.
Rooting pig and rat, away!
Wallabies, forget your play,
Lest you harm one silver ray
Of the starry asphodels!
Little nun flowers sweet and wise,
White and green the laughter lies
Deep within your tender eyes,
Secret-keeping asphodels;
Shyly, slyly watching me,
Seated in the cherry-tree,
Pad and pencil on my knee,
Writing of the asphodels!

Lovers.
A city is a thing unblest,
A shameless harlot richly drest,
Who hides her ugliness away
Beneath a seeming ever gay,
Who with her painted beauty’s lure,
Can hold her many loves secure.
His soul's the price the city cheats
From him who seeks her body’s sweets—
Ilis power to judge and love the worth
Of all the beauties of the earth.
She takes his payment with a smile;
And for a little golden while
She gives him pleasure—yes, oh yes,
And for good measure bitterness.
A farm is as a faithful wife
To live with me throughout my life,
To care for and to comfort me.
The love I give her shall not be
Unfruitful. She has bosoms full—
Round hills, where sheep shall grow me
wool,
And where ‘mid green leaves shall be born
The infant ears of pale gold corn.
Warm milk and yellow grain and fruit,
Green, juicy leaf and earthy root
And sun-gold honey, clear as air.
These are the children she shall bear,
My farm, my wakener of life.
When I have taken her to wife.
But I, before I seek her arms,
Her warm and never-fading charms,
Must skim the froth of youth from life
And spend my lust for love and strife
In all the corners of the earth.
I shall ride forth with Youth and Mirth
As comrades, one on either side,
And seek my lovers as I ride.
And when I find a lovely place—
A mountain with a sweet, dark face,
A valley with enticing arms,
A kind oasis crowned with palms—
I will awhile beside her stay,
Kiss her farewell and ride away !

HIS MASTER’S VOICE.
“The Macdonald Government, which had angered the British public by its undertaking to guarantee a loan of 50 millions demanded by the Soviet Government of Russia, was
defeated at last week's general election. The change in the numerical position of parties is the greatest known in British history.”

STRIKES.
“A cessation of work on the wharves in every port
in Australia is to take place from Saturday until
Monday. This will be done to demonstrate the
strength of the Waterside Workers’ Association.
From Monday other tactics, including an overtime
strike at all ports of the Commonwealth, will prob-
ably be arranged.”
With all the machinery introduced of recent
years to ease the strain between employer
and employed, the strike is just as much in
evidence as ever; and the question as to how
far it is a legitimate weapon is still to be
answered. That it is a foolish weapon goes
without saying. Victory by such means is
dearly purchased; and victory is rare. The
women and children in the workers’ homes
bear the brunt of the suffering necessary to
maintain the battle. The small storekeeper
does much of the financing; and in an
attempt to recover his outstanding accounts
he extends the effects of the strike over months
of peace. Thus each recurring strike is
likely to increase the burden until no wages
which an industry could possibly pay would
be enough to give the workers a living. Not
only is this so, but every strike drags into
its net people in other occupations, and the
suffering is spread far and wide among those
who have nothing to gain by the chance of
victory. Seen in this way, the business of
throwing down tools is not merely foolish
but cruel; and as the chances of success are
always heavily against the workers, there
would seem to be a touch of insanity about
the repetition of methods so vain.
But the effect of constant strikes and
threats of strike on the general outlook for
labor is even more serious than the suffering
and loss inflicted on the families of those
directly implicated. From time to time
thousands of unemployed—some Pf them
capable craftsmen—tramp the streets of Aus-
tralian cities looking for the job that does
not exist. These people seldom think of
connecting their plight with the strikes and
disturbances which get headlines in the news-
papers ; yet the connection is direct. Capital
is available for Australian industries which
in their growth would absorb and more than
absorb all surplus hands. It is not high
wages or the immediate demands of the
workers which prevent such industries from
starting. Within very wide limits industry
can be so organised that it will pay the rates
which may be demanded; but those entering
upon industrial ventures reasonably ask that
they shall know where they stand. They
want to know what the cost of labor will
be; and, having fixed that cost, they want
assurance that matters will remain stable,
at least until the machinery has had a fair
spin. It is here that the deadly influence of the
strike comes in to maintain unemployment
on the largest scale. Looking at the his-
tory of industry during the last few years,
only very sanguine or very courageous men
will take the risk of fresh investments, ex-
cept in directions which are only slightly
influenced by labor unrest. So the country
is held up, patriotic leaders of industry
are discouraged, faith in national ideals
is shaken, the unemployed are made a con-
stant and permanent feature of the land-
scape—all in order that a set of workers may
indulge in the luxury of losing good money.
And all the time the general consuming public
of Australia gets a worse and worse deal;
much that we need gives work to the
foreigner; and the demand for higher Pro-
tection is far less strident than it might be
because of the uncertainty as to whether
some bunch of strikers will allow the goods
to be made here or not. So the game goes
on as it was played 30 years ago. Nothing
seems to be learned from experience, and no
number of failures and losses have any effect
in lessening the uncertainty.
* # * *
On academic lines of argument it may be
conceded that every man has the right to
throw down his tools and say he will not
work. That is merely to assert that he is
free and not a slave. But what he is not
entitled to do is to break an agreement. The
modern strike bears no resemblance to the
old strike in this respect. Until the last
years of the nineteenth century the whole
field was free; no understanding existed:
masters dictated wages which the workers
could take or leave. Now, however, the
strike entails a conspiracy to break an agree-
ment. There is not one industry which has
not used the machinery of arbitration to
better its position; which means that there
is not one industry which has not entered
into an agreement with the public to con-
tinue at its job. It is quite clear that the
first step in any strike is the breaking of
faith by the strikers. They may argue that
they are not bound to their direct employers
by any bonds worthy of preserving; but they
cannot get away from the plain fact that
they are partners in a bargain with the
public, and that to break that bargain is
to swindle the public out of some of its
rights. So the modern striker stands as a
person who throws away his sense of honor,
makes an attack upon his country at a vital
point, increases the number of unemployed,
inflicts great cruelty on others, and always
loses heavily in return for a poor chance
of a nominal win. On the face of it, the
thing looks insane; in fact, it looks so in-
sane and so unlike anything genuinely Aus-
tralian that all strikes are under grave sus-
picion. If the urgers and whisperers of
these foolish stoppages of work are out to
serve some other end, the insanity may be
explained; or, rather, it may be seen as a
rehearsal for the larger insanity of revolution
by violence. In a country where practically
everyone has three meals a day, whether he
earns them or not, reform by violence can
never be a very attractive doctrine; but the
confusion of ideas which may arise out of
lost strikes and the hopeless domestic situa-
tion they create might well be looked upon
as the goad to violent action of some sort.
Just as a man sometimes kicks the cat be-
cause he cannot drive a nail straight, so
a man may of frenzied wantonness be
maddened into shooting his own brother be-
cause he cannot pay his grocer’s bill. The
Itussian revolution was very much a thing
of that kind. The peasant, unable through
the effect of a wide-spread corruption to pay
his way, rose in wrath to slaughter all who
could keep their heads above water. His
detestation for the old middle-classes was far
greater than any hatred he might have for
the old officialism which robbed him. The
modern strike, which is altogether too dis-
honorable, foolish and ineffective for Aus-
tralian use, must be strongly suspected of
springing from this foreign revolutionary
seed. What the worker too often fails to
realise is that the revolutionary has no real
regard for him or his home: he is merely a
pawn in the game.
GREAT THOUGHTS OF GREAT
PAPERS.
If an enemy from the top of the map, where
empty Australia abuts most closely on to
densely-peopled Asia and trouble is always in
sight, comes this way 20 years hence, and
finds the country as unprepared to defend
itself and to keep itself white as it was 20
years ago, the exceeding smallness of “great
dailies” will help to account for the disaster.
And possibly the most microscopic mammoth
of the collection is Melbourne Age. When
Australia’s danger is considered, attention
always concentrates on the area on the far
side of a line drawn from Townsville in
Queensland to Geraldton in Westralia. This
area is most easy to attack, and most difficult
and most neglected in the matter of defence.
Our title to it is liable to be laughed out of
court, as matters stand, for lack of reason-
able occupation. And there are traitors in
our midst who are prepared to give this
great heritage away on the plea that the
North is no white man’s land—traitors who
are helped and encouraged in that plea Dy
the lack of reasonable effort to make the
territory accessible, so that white men in
plenty may go there. Within recent times
events have proved the existence at the seat
of Empire of a large party which believes in
the abandonment of the Pacific in a naval
sense. Events have also proved the exist-
ence of an at present smaller party which
suggests pushing the Dominions out of the
Empire, to shift for themselves in the wilder-
ness beyond—a party which suggests a
general break up, in fact. And the theory
has been formally advanced, by a Power
which has means to argue with, that the
old theory of the right of exclusion of aliens
is all wrong. It is said that the landlord
with unoccupied space has no equitable
status as against the prospective would-be
tenant outside who wants space, and that he
can’t even claim to select his lodger. But
despite these developments the general apathy
continues. Sometimes it passes for a noble
calm and a refusal to be stampeded into
sudden or ill-considered action. Generally
it doesn’t pass as anything save a somnolent
neglect to be aware of the situation, or aware
that any situation exists. That attitude
saves the small politician from losing any
reputation lie may possess by making a
muddle of a matter that is beyond his size.
* * * ®
The Age, in a pronouncement of October 23,
took up the position that apathy is cheap,
and that refusal to provide in any appreci-
able way for the settlement and consequently
for the defence of the Northern Territory
(our most vulnerable point) isn’t prohibited
by the terms on which the Territory was
transferred. The Bruce-Page Government
had recognised that railway construction is
the only promising aid to settlement, the
one fairly dense and promising and continu-
ous streak of population in the tropics being
along the Queensland State line. With
grudging and reluctance it proposed to spare
enough loan money to build some three or
four hundred miles of standard-gauge rail-
way from the Federal southern railway sys-
tem, not exactly into tropical Australia, but
to the edge of it, and a little beyond the
edge of the Commonwealth’s own neglected,
undeveloped, and undefended Possession.
Hence the impassioned and remarkable pro-
test of Melbourne’s very small great daily:—
It would not be surprising, after the Brisbane-
Ivyogle job, if the Commonwealth were willing to
agree with South Australia to construct a brand-
new railway from Kingoonya to Alice Springs,
accepting the greater share of liability on its own
behalf, as well as that of nonpartieipating States....
Under the N. Territory Acceptance Act of 1910, the
Commonwealth agreed with S. Australia to purchase
the Port Augusta-Oodnadatta railway, and “agreed to
complete the construction of the transcontinental
railway from Port Darwin to Port Augusta.” Ways
and means were left to be determined. However
valuable from a developmental point of view, an
entirely new line running north from the Common-
wealth-owned East-West railway, and competing with
the Oodnadatta line, obviously transcends the obli-
gation accepted by the Commonwealth. The rest
of Australia, outside S. Australia, would be called
upon to bear the cost, running into several millions,
of a line the major benefit of which would be con-
ferred on S. Australia.
The case for taking up a comatose attitude
over the one supremely big question in Aus-
tralian politics may be set out thus :
The Federal (formerly S. Australian) line which
extends 478 miles northward towards the Territory
shouldn’t be completed because, in its unfinished
state, it loses money. Yet even populous N. S.
Wales has plenty of quite completed lines which lose
far more money per mile.
Because it is a narrow-gauge line, like half
the railways of Australia, and so is inadequate for
defence purposes.
Because States with, more voting power want any
funds that are or may become available.
Because it is a “desert railway” (the Age has
used that expression till it has become a weariness)
and has been built along an ill-chosen route.
At the same time, as shown above, the pro-
posal to wipe out the alleged blunder, and
start building afresh from the Port Augusta
end with a serviceable 4ft. Bj)in. line, by a
shorter and allegedly more fertile path, comes
in for stern condemnation: —
Because the new line isn’t in “the obligation
accepted by the Commonwealth.”
The Age has consistently scoffed at the idea
of fulfilling the obligation accepted by the
Commonwealth, and it is still scoffing. And
it was one of the many papers which advo-
cated the tearing up of the obligation and
the substitution of a railway from Victoria,
through western N.S.W. to Queensland. 8o
its anxiety about the obligation is belated.
Because about 330 miles of it will be in S. Aus.
When (or if) the proposed new line is com-
pleted right across the continent, another 1100
miles or so will, however, be on Federal soil.
It seems hardly worth while for Australia
to commit almost certain suicide by leaving
the North inaccessible and undefended just
for fear one of its States should make a
scrap of profit.
Because, after building, say, half a railway, the
other half (the Age mentions 500 miles) remains
to be done.
It is hard to see how this can be avoided,
arithmetic being what it is. It has always
happened that when anything was half fin-
ished 50 per cent, of it was not finished.
* # * •
The new proposal doesn’t really deviate
so far from the old bargain that any purist
or Pharisee need make trouble over it.
According to the pound of flesh in the agree-
ment the . Federal authority was ' “to con-
struct, or cause to be constructed, a railway
in S. Australia proper, from any point on
the Port Augusta railway to a point on the
northern boundary line of S. Australia
proper, to connect with that part of the trans-
continental railway to be built in the N.
Territory from Darwin southward....” The
proposal now is to build exactly as speci-
fied, but from the Commonwealth’s Port
Augusta-Kalgoorlie line instead of from its
Port Augusta-Oodnadatta line. Australia
has spent more than one transcontinental
line on a commercial fleet which is mostly
laid up and for sale cheap. It lately spent
between one and two hundred miles of line
on two more ships which no one expects to
earn their keep, for. unlike a railway, they
have to compete against outside vessels run
at half their cost. But foolish and fleeting-
enterprises of the sort are accepted with
little, debate because the building and manage-
ment and job control of ships keep men in
the cities. On the other hand cross-Australia
railway construction is alien to the carefully
fostered cockney spirit of this young country.
FOOLS AND FINANCE.
The annual crop of loan estimates is ripen-
ing in the sun, and some of the harvest is
already reaped. That of N. g. Wales is for
£5,700,000. At a rough summing up it may
be said that the odd £700,000 is fairly honest,
in the sense of being for works as per-
manent as any mundane institution can be
expected to be, with, in addition, a lighting
chance to pay the interest bill. At another
rough summing up, the rest, which is
£8,000,000, falls into three categories—bad
swindle, worse swindle and shameless
swindle. At one time railways and tram-
ways were supposed to represent almost the
whole of the loan expenditure, while tele-
graphs and telephones (now looked after by
the Commonwealth) accounted for most of
the balance. Now they represent less than
half the annual loan expenditure, and the
balance is mostly odd jobs. The proposed
expenditure on railways and tramways for
the glad new financial year is £3,835,000,
which leaves about £4,835,000 for odd jobs.
And not one of the new lines on the schedule
opens the way to a new port, where a new
self-supporting city and a new decentralised
population might grow. Their tendency is
rather to wind up at names like Taralga.
Monia Gap, Boggabilla, Pulletop and
Eugowra, or else they wind up, for the time
at all events, at some place that isn’t so much
as a name, and are “towards Condobolin,” or
something of the sort. Indeed, Premier
Fuller, practically disencumbered himself
the other day of the pioneering idea. “He
agreed that decentralisation of industry was
advisable,” in the perfunctory tone of the
person who admits that Heaven is no doubt
a decent sort of place, “but the getting of
people was the greatest and most urgent con-
cern.” When Australia has acquired 10 mil-
lion inhabitants it apparently doesn’t matter
much 'whether they are diffused round the
coast to assert our ownership and keep an eye
lifting for possible enemies, or form a dense
mob near Woolloomooloo Bay.
* * * *
In earlier days it was customary to speak
of a railway as a concern which paid work-
ing expenses and interest, or which would do
so when it had cut its teeth. It is signifi-
cant of a change of outlook that it is now
proposed to put the non-paying lines into a
category of their own, and charge their losses
to taxation, instead of extracting enough
from the paying lines to cover the losses of
their bankrupt brethren. The good railways
will then only require to meet their own ex-
penses and interest bill, and the bad ones
will be put on the old-age pension list.
Whether this change will make the accounts
look better or not depends on how the
accounts are made to look; and in any case
very few people read accounts. Apparently
it is decided that the “reproductive” fiction
has had its day, and the conclusion is arrived
at that the deficit has come to stay; also
that many of the present money-losers (they
represent about seven-elevenths of the
N. Wales railway mileage), together with
many partly finished lines, have no visible
future. Certainly the making of steel
ways into vast regions which are losing
to the city the few industries they ever
possessed, and often losing their population
to the city as well, is a poor game. Evidence
of this appears in the fact that out of the
last 27 new sections opened before the issue of
the last railway report, 25 joined the list of
non-paying lines right off, and show no signs
of leaving it. Two problems arise here: (1)
How much railway subsidy can be charged
to taxation without making trouble of one
sort or another? (2) What will happen in
the labor market when some Government has
to leave off building pensioned railways?
*,* * *
Still the chief interest of the Fuller
Government’s loan schemes is not in the
small half which deals with railways, and in
which there is some kind of order and prece-
dent. It lies in the bigger or odd-job half,
wherein there is no order whatsoever. In
other days some nominal kind of rule was
supposed to exist as to what was allowable as
loan expenditure and what was chargeable
to revenue. There was a fence between the
two sorts of liability—dilapidated and not
rabbit-proof, but still a fence. Now the
Treasurer skies a copper to decide whether
an item shall go into one account or the other,
and then makes it a loan expenditure on
general principles. So low has the political
tone become that many people doubt if he
came honestly by the copper. Among the
Fuller Ministry’s multitudinous loan items
ar.e schools (£118,000), hospitals (£100,000).
roads (£230,000). relief to poor people
on the land (£95,000), land settlement
(£312.000), more settlement (£74,000). land
development and settlement (£500,000). de-
velopmental work (£125,300) and shallow bor-
ing for water for farmers (£52,700) ; also there
is provision for a dredging plant, a library,
some commission or another, irrigation in
some spot unspecified, harbor improvements
galore and sundries. Many of these are
hardy serials, which had a loan last year and
the year before, and will have one next year
and the year after; and no attempt is made,
as commonest honesty demands, to provide
any reasonable sinking fund toivards meeting
these non-productive liabilities. It is just
possible that the present generation of Ful-
lers and their kind is overdoing the thing.
A question which only revolutionists want to
raise is: How far is a son liable for his
dissipated father’s drinking and gambling
debts; in' other words, for the liabilities he
left behind him with no corresponding assets?
How far is he bound in honor to sacrifice
himself for the sake of the people who sold
.the old man drink on credit when the old
man had obviously more drink than was good
for him already? Only revolutionists leant
to raise that question, but it may rise of it-
self if fools make the position too impossible.
A HUMAN GOD.
His Majesty Yoshihito, Emperor of Japan
and a god incarnate, celebrated his
birthday on the last day of last month. The
Emperor Jimmu, who was an incarnation of
the sun, founded the dynasty GGO b.c., and
the present ruler is the 122nd of his line.
He has been an invalid for years. The only
occasion on which I was privileged to see
this man-deity, whom a highly-industrialised
nation of 70 millions literally worships, was
some years ago, when he proceeded to the


family tombs outside Kioto to pay his re-
spects to his recently-departed mother. We
experienced considerable difficulty in obtain-
ing permission to witness the procession,
and when we eventually arrived at the spot
found we were the only foreigners there.
The several thousand spectators, all admitted
by ticket, were standing in different en-
closures facing the grassy approach to the
Imperial mausoleum. Students from hun-
dreds of schools stood in demure groups
under tlieir college banners, and grave seniors
in sober grey kimonos stood silently waiting
in the drifting rain. Opposite, a row of
gigantic cryptomeria loomed up like misty
columns of a temple. An officer next to
me told me politely to lower my unsesthetic
European umbrella, and as I did so the in-
carnation of the Goddess of the Sun drove
by in an open carriage. His slight figure
was dressed in the uniform of a naval
officer, and the weary eyes in his
delicate long face, with the marks
of mortal illness on it, stared straight before
him. A soft, almost imperceptible, “sissa”
went sighing through the crowd like a;
gentle stirring of wind amongst the pines.
It was a typically Japanese expression of
the intense emotion of that throng of
worshippers standing in the rain. No eyes
followed the disappearing chariot of the sun.
All stood mute and motionless until the last
of the Imperial carriages containing the
sacred princes—demi-gods in military uni-
form—and the princesses in European gowns
with black mantillas wrapped round their
heads, had rolled past. Before the carven
Buddhas of their temples these people are
happy, smiling and unawed; only in the
presence of these human incarnations they
are still and sombre.
In the evening we went to a gymnasium.
A temple of patriotism it was, which, like
a Mohammedan mosque, we were only
allowed to enter in our stockinged feet. Old
men, young men and boys were filing in,
each as he passed the little shrine, above
which was a portrait of the Emperor, paus-
ing and making an obeisance. At one end
of the huge arena shouting men and boys
in armor of padding were fighting with
single-sticks; at the other, diminutive
Hercules in loincloths were practising jiu-
jitsu. There was almost a religious inten-
sity about the game. Adults wei*e showing
little children the various holts and crosses;
and all the time went on those silent genu-
flections in front of the Imperial effigy that
made the proceedings so like a sacred rite.
The Emperor’s public appearances are few
and far between, and little is known of what
goes on behind the palace walls: editors
are fined or imprisoned for speculating on
it, however mildly. Women surround the
person of the ruler. As incarnation of the
Goddess of the Sun, lu* has jurisdiction over
the world of spirits and of men ; once a year
the gods themselves wait upon him and
spend a month at his Court. Such holi-
ness was ascribed to all his members in
ancient times that neither hair, nails nor
beard could be removed ; and lest he should
go too dirty lie was washed in his sleep,
when his spirit was absent. To-day the
dentist and the barber may handle his divine
person, but they must wear silk gloves while
they are doing it. Formerly he was obliged
to sit on the throne for some hours every
morning, stirring neither hands nor feet,
head nor eyes, so that he could preserve
peace and tranquillity in his empire; for
if he should bend his body in one direction
or another, or look too long towards any
portion of his dominions, war, famine, fire
or pestilence would break out and desolate
it. To-day war is declared or famine averted
by edict of the same incarnate deity who
has become the mouthpiece of the handful
of great aristocrats controlling the destinies
of modern Japan.
One cannot but admire the astuteness of
the Elder Statesmen, tin 1 hereditary Clans-
men who in the dangerous period of Japan’s
transformation from a mediaeval feudalism
to an up-to-date industrial state rescued the
man-god from the obscurity into which he
had fallen and invented the religion of
Mikadoism as an instrument of government.
Incongruous as it seems amongst the reek-
ing smoke-stacks of Kobe, the prosaic acti-
vity of Osaka and the suffragettes of Tokio,
it is the living faith of nine Japanese out of
ten. Although the first date that can be
relied on in Japanese history is about the
sixth century of our era, historians of real
scientific attainments commence their story
with the sacred dynastic myths: the consul
or professor who did or said otherwise would
lose his job. And although 70 years ago the
man-god had no prestige and was then, as he
is to-day, merely the captive of two powerful
families, radical editors in their attacks upon
the Constitution keep their backs turned upon
this salient fact. The conception of a deity
incarnate guiding the destinies of the country
lias become ingrained, and Chauvinists find in
it a text for any claim, however monstrous.
Here, from a Japanese newspaper, is the appli-
cation of the ancient creed to a very modern
problem: “The Imperial family of Japan is
as worthy of respect as God, and is the
embodiment of Benevolence and Justice....
The Imperial family of Japan is the parent
not only of her 60 millions, but of all man-
kind on earth.... All human disputes, there-
fore, may be settled in accordance with its
immaculate justice. The League of Nations
can only attain its real object by placing
the Imperial family at its head, for to attain
its objects the League must have a strong
punitive force of super-national and super-
racial character, and this force can only be
found in the Imperial family of Japan.”
Before a deity with such attributes as this,
the voice of Democracy must, for a long time
to come, remain very still and small indeed.

Welcome Back, John Bull!
After ten months of Labor-Socialism com-
bined with an enthusiastic subordination of
British interests to those of foreign coun-
tries —for that is what internationalism
amounts to in practice— John Bull de-
cided last week that he had had enough.
Decided it so emphatically that the Con-
servatives, whose policy is Britain for the
British and the Empire for the people there-
of, will have a majority of 200 over the
other parties, with the Independents thrown
in. Bolling strongly everywhere, they added
350 seats to the 257 they held m the late
Parliament, whereas the EaJ 301 ' P a *’ ty , st
40 seats and the Liberals 111. In the long
history of British elections there has seldom
been such a victory. The Liberals paid
dearly for their folly in voting Baldwin
out of office and Macsiiuffle in. Asquith,
their leader, was beaten in a _ Scottish con-
stituency which had been Liberal for 92
years. ‘Scotland, which gave them large
majorities at every election from 1532 to
3.910, on this occasion rejected nearly
all their candidates; and Manchester
rejected the lot. In the result, the
party which was 376 strong after the
affair of 1906, and which ruled Bri-
tain for the ten succeeding years, has
been reduced to a pitiful remnant of 41,
some of whom represent minorities, land
others owe their seats to the charity of the
Conservatives in not running candidates
against them. It is a severe sentence, but
not too severe considering the party’s waver-
ing foreign policy, the watery socialism in
which it has sought refuge of recent years,
and its infatuated belief that the lost trade
of Britain would come back if it kept on
mumbling the shibboleths of an absurd fiscal
superstition. The Labor party was handled
less roughly, hut some choice spirits will
he missing from its ranks when Parliament
meets. One of them is Leacii, the Air
Minister, who began by announcing that
his ideal policy of air-defence was embodied
in the Sermon on the Mount. Another is
Miss Susan Lawrence, who recently visited
Moscow, and returned with the glad news
that nothing else was talked of but the
British loan. Several other Labor legisla-
tors who have been to Moscow or who take
their instructions from Moscow are num-
bered among the casualties. And Tom
Mann, who stood as a Communist, with the
added distinction of being an officer in the
Red Army, lost his deposit. Australia has
no friends among these extraordinary people.
Its friends are all in the Baldwin party.
That party will no doubt revive the project
of the Singapore base, which the Mac-
shuffle Government abandoned in a rush
of pacifism to the head, and grant the tariff
preference agreed upon at the Economic
Conference. But the satisfaction felt in this
country at Baldwin’s success has nothing
to do with the resolutions of the Economic
Conference or the Singapore base. It springs
from the knowledge that Father Bull is
resolved to have no Red fool-fury on his
island, and is determined to work out his
destinies in his own way, which isn’t the
Trotsky way. As in the days of Philip
11., Louis XIV., Robespierre and the two
Napoleons, the stubborn Old Man will allow
no foreign potentate—least of all a cold-
footed cadger without even the honor that
exists among thieves—to intervene in his
affairs.

Cricket and the Sport of Crooks.
The recent disqualification of people promi-
nent in racing has set people talking about a
Spring-cleaning. Most arguments reach the
point of an admission that utter reform
is impossible; and very few seriously claim
that the alleged sport is of any value to the
community. Yet behind all the talk and
the knowledge that the punter is continu-
ally taken down by systematised fraud, as
well as by the legal machinery of authorised
betting, there is a feeling for the beauty of
a race and for the animals engaged in it
which runs far back to our human begin-
nings. Greece and Rome raced their chariots
amid great public enthusiasm; there was a
Stone-Age racecourse in the neighborhood of
Stonehenge; and the racing of horses fills
part of the background of the earliest Irish
myth. The horse and man were early com-
panions ; and the galloping of horses was
associated with all that man knew of speedy
movement from place to place for many ages.
A fine horse shape is beautiful in all eyes;
and there is a glamor about the sleek con-
testants on the green track that moves men
strangely. On this feeling has been built
up a mass of shabby business, doubtful prac-
tice and crude cheating which makes it all
very cloudy, but cannot take away some lin-
gering sense of the royal sport that men feel
it might be. It is, in fact, the idealised race-
course at the back of the racegoer’s mind
that makes him such an easy prey to those
who exploit the game. The question is
whether reforms are possible which would
make the sport clean and give it some of the
wholesome atmosphere of other outdoor
pastimes. Judging by the modern history of
cricket reforms should be by no means impos-
sible. As a game cricket is absolutely clean ;
it stands out in a fair light with all its
interest depending on the skill of the players
and owing nothing whatever to the adven-
titious aid of a betting-ring or any get-ricli-
quick desire on the part of the spectators.
Yet before the middle of last century this
same cricket was the most unclean of all
pastimes. With bowling all under-arm and
single-wicket matches arranged for wagers
between rival champions, many features of
the play, as we know it, were wholly absent.
A noisome crowd gathered on the ground to
make bets about the result; matches were
freely bought and sold, and professional
players were suborned by sporting gents of
loud waistcoats to betray their teams. Out
of this slough of infamy the game arose,
clean, wholesome and attractive —the most
honored outdoor sport of all. It seems rea-
sonable enough to suppose that something
of the same sort could happen to racing if
similar means of reform were tried. Cricket
received its great impetus from the enlarge-
ment of the rules which allowed round-arm
and then over-arm bowling. This at once
raised the standard of skill. People found
it worth playing and watching—found that
it had so many points of interest that a bet
merely confused things. It was good enough
without the gambling element, and so the
gambling about results died away and almost
ceased to exist. There is a rule of the M.O.C.
that umpires must not bet which always
raises a smile. It is so long since any
umpire thought of betting that the rule re-
mains as a mere curiosity from a not too
remote past. The line of similar reform in
connection with racing would seem to be a
general raising of the weights which horses
are expected to carry. Once the genuine
horse-lover could ride his own horse with
some prospect of success the thugs and
whisperers would begin to fall away, a more
valuable breed of animal would be produced,
and it would become less and less necessary
to eke out the interest of a genuinely con-
tested race with the hope of winning easy
money. Then the bookmaker would probably
take his odds and his brazen roar to tlje
speedways where motor-bikes raised their
clatter and stink. The atmosphere of suen
a place would suit him better ; and the punter
could still indulge his love for being cheated
by a mechanical process, while the worship
of the horse continued in a clearer air.

Ships, Sheep and Sundries.
There will be considerable row about
the decision of the Bruce-Page Government
to have a pair of submarines built in Eng-
land without giving the local Cockatoo
(N.S.W.) institution a chance to tender; in
fact, there may be more row than the busi-
ness is worth. The really important matter
involved is not the job itself, for when a
particular ship is finished it is ended,
which is also the way with a par-
ticular railway, and the search for a
new job commences de novo, and likewise
ad infinitum. But the hope was entertained
that Government shipbuilding would lead the
Avay to private shipbuilding on a large, self-
supporting scale, and this it has failed badly
to do. It doesn’t, apparently, lead to any-
thing. A Government ship costs twice as
much to build as there is any hope of earn-
ing interest on, and at least twice as much
as an average outside price, so that it is
largely relief work. Then any kind of Aus-
tralian vessel costs twice as much to run
as an ordinary sort of outside ship. There
being no Protection on the high seas, there is
practically nothing save coastal work to do
except in the case of a Government line, run
at heavy loss. Shipbuilding is, however, a
pet industry because it belongs almost en-
tirely to the big, pampered capitals. It can’t
wander inland, and diffuse itself among the
little towns, and promote the spread of popu-
lation as the woollen’ or linen or cotton busi-
ness could do under a more rational policy.
And Government shipowning not only centres
its activities in the big cities, but offers large
opportunities for job control, so it is another
petted undertaking. Yet the business is a
persistent dud. In 1919-20 the whole num-
ber of workpeople employed in the Common-
wealth under the head of “ship- and boat-
building and repairing” was 8343, and that
was the highest figure attained. In 1921-
22, where the present statistics leave off, the
employees were only 7035. In and about
these years the Commonwealth had building,
in its own and private yards, the good but
dashed unprofitable ships Eudunda, Eurelia,
Enoggera, Emita, Erriba, Eromanga, Eurim
bla, Ecliuca, Echunga, Euwarra, Euroa,
Elouera and Erina, and towards the end
of the period it broke into another letter
of the alphabet, and laid the foundation-
stones of the good but non-paying vessels
Fordsdale and Ferndale. In fact, Govern-
ment became practically the surviving rem-
nant of the industry, and the remnant relapsed
into semi-pauperism. On the other hand,
Australia furnished employment, under the
heading of “Clothing and textile fabrics,
etc.,” to 89,424 people in 1919-20, and 97,192
in 1921-22. This included the woollen indus-
try, which might certainly be classed as
“natural,” seeing that the wool grows here
and the output is used here. It is, or ought
to be, permanent, with unlimited capacity
for expansion, for all people want clothes
and want them all the time, whereas the
building of Government ships which cost so
much to build and run that they have to be
laid up, or else sold for what they will fetch,
is both artificial and temporary. The fac-
tories don’t ask any 50 per cent, subsidy,
which (or more) is what the Government
section of the shipbuilding concern has cost.
But a great downfall began in 1922, and Bri-
tish mills, paying about half Australian
wages, closed wholesale because they couldn’t
face the competition of Protectionist or de-
preciated-currency countries, and Australia
became a dump for Ilun and other woollens
camouflaged as British and passed in under
the British special low tariff. The natural
industry of dealing with the moss of the
sheep applied for more Protection to meet
the new calamity, and it is wonderful how
long it applied before the Government heard
its voice. This was because it is a scattered
concern, with so little dignity that it trades
at times in small provincial towns, and small
towns naturally can’t expect anything. Par-
liament at last enacted a measure of relief,
to come in force next April, and with this pre-
cedent to guide it, The Bulletin, if it finds
any member of the Bruce-P’age Ministry
drowning between now and Christmas,
will fish him out next April and no sooner.
If he is dead then it is no more and no worse
than many factories are likely to be.
Whether the half-hearted relief which is to
arrive in April will make much difference
will be proved after the event, or after the
funeral. The Hun. fiercely resolved to re-
cover all he lost in war-time, works hard
and scientifically these days for 6d. per hour.

The Russian Letter.
The men who compose shriek headlines for
the dailies wasted a great deal of ink and
astonishment over the letter from the chief
of some Red organisation at Moscow, urgipg
the promotion of mutiny and bloodstained
insurrection in the British Isles. Their
shouts in big letters read: “Gospel of Mos-
cow,” “Soviet Methods,” “Armed Rebellion
Urged in England,” “Communist Conspiracy, ’
and so on. What of it all? Armed rebellion
is being openly urged here, largely by people
not born here and consequently eligible for
deportation ; only, unluckily, there is lack of a
Government with the energy to nip danger-
ous windbags in the bud. They have been at
work for quite a while, and announce that
they are really making progress with their
plans for murder, arson, general confiscation
of property and the destruction of this coun-
try’s self-governing institutions. Some of
them have been to Moscow, and have come
back, as they avowed, with hope and instruc-
tion and moral support, and bags full of
“Soviet methods” and “Communist conspi-
racy.” There are revolutionary institutions
here which make no disguise of being inspired
by the persistent meddlers with everybody's
business who hang out in Trotskow, and the
recent attempted meddling, by these same
parties, in Britain’s political affairs, even if
it is all that it has been painted, looks like
part of the regular day’s work, rather badly
done and distinctly mistimed. Some Govern-
ments have a more impatient way than ours
with prospective upheavers and blood-
shedders. Recently some North-of-I reland
officials discovered, at Newry, a long thin
figure which seemed familiar. They identi-
fied it as De Valera, come to take a hand at
their elections in the insurrectionary inter-
est. He was taken to the border an 1 de-
ported—run out. Being found again on the
forbidden ground (at Derry this time) he
was run in, and his return has made him
liable to two years. There is something to
be said for these simple methods. Even if
they savor of direct action, it is at least
legal action.

We and Some Others.
With Europe talking about a five days’ air-
ship service from London to Darwin, and
Uncle Sam threatening to come across the
Pacific to Sydney via Thursday Island in
half a dozen one-day hops, the Northern
Territory looks more remote and more like
a foreign country than ever. In fact, since
it takes 10 days for a steamer to get to
Darwin from Sydney and anything from one
month to three for a motor-car to fight its
way through the flocks of kangaroos and
wombats overland, it is doubtful whether
Australia has any right to call the country
hers at all. The attitude of languid indiffer-
ence adopted by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment over the alleged kidnapping of two white
women (Australian subjects) by Arnheim
Land blacks suggests that it also has
doubts about the real ownership of the
strangely-named country. The possibility
of Darwin becoming a depot for trans-
oceanic aircraft while it remains iso-
lated from the rest of Australia by
land is disquieting, and may suggest un-
lawful hopes to overcrowded countries adja-
cent. An expert recently investigated the
prospects of cotton-growing in Australia, and
estimated that the Northern Territory has
an area capable of growing cotton of
76,000,000 acres, while the total area of
Uncle Sam’s cotton belt is only 35,000,000
acres. The difference between Uncle Sam
and us is that Uncle uses his cotton land for
growing cotton, whereas we use ours for
losing white women. Also Uncle grapples
his territory to him with hoops of steel,
while Australia leaves hers lying around
for anybody to pick up or run an airship
service to.
The Treatment of T.B.
A chorus from Waterfall (N.S.W.) :
For years the Civilian T.B. Association has been
begging the State Government to establish an indus-
trial village settlement for T.B. sufferers. We
became very interested in this form of treatment
after learning of the wonderful success of two villages
in England. At Papworth, in Cambridgeshire, there
are 200 patients who work from one to six hours per
day. All classes of trades are taught, and the men
are paid full wages for the work accomplished. In
1921 the sale of products, etc., for six months
amounted to £13,000. But what interested us more
was the fact of the scheme having solved a difficult
problem that most sufferers have to face. At pre-
sent most “early cases’’ find it necessary to keep on
working. Eventually they break down, and as a
last resource enter a sanatorium to die, after having
perhaps infected their family. Under the village
settlement scheme the sufferer would be encouraged
to leave his unhealthy city job, and bring his wife
and kiddies to the village, where he would be able
to support them in healthy surroundings.
Nobody has ever disputed the. success of the indus-
trial village settlement scheme; in fact, it is uni-
versally acknowledged as the most up to date in
existence. Yet we find an ill-advised State Govern-
ment about to expend £5OOO on a scheme that has
always proved a failure. Recently that sum was
voted for the experiment of a farm colony at the
Waterfall Sanatorium —above all places! There is
no question of the unsuitability of such a place.
Apart from the trying climate, and the very inferior
land which surrounds the sanatorium, the very name
of Waterfall attached to a new venture would act as
al damper on its success.
The Medical Superintendent of Waterfall recently
visited Maoriland and Victoria in connection with
this proposed scheme. According to N.S.W. Chief
Secretary Oakes, he (Dr. Palmer) “inquired into one
or two examples where such treatment has been
adopted, particularly in Victoria, and so far the
experiment has cost Victoria upwards of £30,000.”
On making inquiries through the proper channels we
find that the Victorian Government has never experi-
mented with any such scheme for tubercular sufferers.
The only farm colony in Victoria is a small affair
at Janefield, conducted by the Red Cross Society.
At present there are only six men working on it, and
the Red Cross has started negotiations to get rid
of it; so it seems as if it was going to meet with the
same failure as the soldiers’ farm colony of N. S.
Wales, which was given best some considerable time
ago. We venture to suggest that if soldiers on good
pensions, backed up by a wealthy organisation, fail
to make good, it is rather absurd to think that a
crowd of civilians without any pension can do so.
The N. S. Wales Government will be wise if it
follows the excellent lead given by the Vic. Govern-
ment a few months ago, when it chose a site at Mont
Park for an up-to-date establishment, to be run on
the lines of the Papworth Settlement in England.
Men naturally want to work at a trade they know,
and, incidentally, a trade they have a practical inter-
est in. It is to be hoped that sufferers over the
Murray appreciate all that is being done for them,
and the staunch, sympathetic friend they have found in
Minister of Health Jones. We feel confident it was
largely due to his efforts that his colleagues turned
down any overtures for a farm colony, and plumped
for an industrial village settlement.

Pratten and the Pictures.
Since the moving-picture censorship was
made a bit stricter (or less lenient), Prat-
ten, the Minister for Customs, has been a
target for attacks written in the American
lingo, some of which have been venomously
personal. He has defended himself briskly,
remarking of a pony-racing journal which
has been the most persistent mudslinger that
it was “merely after picture ads.,” and de-
claring that the policy which he had set in
motion had received the approval of all sec-
tions of the House of Reps., and that, for
his part, it would be “vigorously carried out
until Australia ceases to be the dumping-
ground for questionable U'.S. productions.”
The Minister has also stated that, so far
from the American interests showing any
respect for Australian public opinion, as
manifested in Parliament and at returned-

soldier conferences and elsewhere, 59 of the
194 “feature-films” examined during the last
three months had to be cut by the Censor,
while nine were returned to the agents for
reconstruction, and four were so filthy that
they were rejected outright. And, in spite
of the official warning that films passed for
exhibition were liable to be recalled if the
heralding was suggestive, a lot of the adver-
tising is still aggressively salacious—witness
"Temporary Marriage,” mentioned in the
S.A. Assembly by Mclntosh, the Country-
party leader, which was billed to contain
scenes in which “a Hawaiian girl dances the
liula-hula with an utter disregard for de-
cency,” and "each lady, in addition to re-
vealing her lurid past, is also bent on reveal-
ing herself as much as her dressmaker will
permit.” On this phase of the subject, Pro-
fessor Wallace, the Chief Censor, has made
the illuminating statement that "with each
U.S. film comes a pressbook telling pro-
prietors how to advertise. These pressbooks
are shocking productions; some of them are
utterly vulgar and obscene.” If the film-
fanciers were all adults there would be no
need for a censorship, nor would one be toler-
ated by the Australian people. But a large
proportion of them are girls and boys, and
the pictures are mostly made by the wrong-
people—unpleasant foreigners who mock at
marriage and conjugal fidelity, paint crime,
vice and miscegenation in attractive colors,
indulge in a villainous jargon and even more
villainous manners, and, in some cases, are
animated by a vicious hostility to the British
Empire. Since parents can’t or won’t with-
draw their children from these influences, it
is the duty of the Government controlling
the traffic in pictures to do so, in the inter-
ests of the community on which the sins of
film-crazed youth are visited, as well as the
children themselves. And if the foreign
gentry imagine that the community won’t
stand behind the Government in this business,
and that the policy of the country can be
over-ridden by bluff and insolence and black-
guardism, they are making a bad mistake.
Yet the censorship, however efficient, is only
half the battle. Pratten has made a good
start, and he put the case pithily when he
told a deputation of film-agents who com-
plained that his regulations were endangering
their “industry” that the issue lay between
the Government and a few wealthy companies
whose profits went to America; but unless he
actively encourages the production of Aus-
tralian pictures his work will be incomplete.
And by Australian pictures are meant, not
those sickening crime-stories and idiotic cari-
catures of bushfolk that get made and exhi-
bited somehow, but films up to the standard
of “The Sentimental Bloke.” Except for one
factor, the conditions were never more favor-
able to local picture-production on a large
scale. Along with other countries, Australia
lias grown weary of Hollywood film-plays,
with tlieir overdone plots and characters and
scenery, and their stupid sacrifice of action
to extravagant meets. The conviction is
dawning upon it that the press-agent has had
the loan o£ its leg. and that a multitude of
very bad actors and actresses, many of whom,
judged by Australian standards, are not even
pretty, have been foisted on them as stars.
Australians would like to see ,T. C. William-
son, Ltd., and the Ward-Fuller enterprise
making pictures. These people control
numerous theatres, employ a large number of
capable mummers —some of them have
already exhibited an aptitude for film-work,
while many ex-employees of J. C. William-
son. Ltd., arc drawing high salaries in U.S.
studios —and would no doubt turn out excel-
lent goods. But. of course, there is no chance
oi either firm going into the business so long
as Australia is fool enough to let American
films come in at lid. per foot. As things, arc,
the owners of a production which has ex-
hausted the U.S. theatres (there are 25.000
of them) can strike off a copy at Hollywood
and place it on the Australian market for a
few pounds all told. Until the balance is
redressed by a stiff Protective duty, phot the
restriction of imports to a certain footage
per year, these Zuecors, Laemmles, Selz-
nicics and so forth will continue to draw a
huge tribute from this country, and the de-
velopment of a national picture industry will
be out of the question.

Two Labor Conferences.
The latest Inter-State Labor Conference was
an improvement on the one at Brisbane
three years ago. On that occasion there was
so much sympathy with Moscow that the
party’s old Australian objective—“the culti-
vation of an Australian sentiment based on
the maintenance of racial purity and the de-
velopment of an enlightened and self-reliant
community”—was cast out in favor of “the
socialisation of industry, production, distri-
bution and exchange,” and it was decided
that there should be a Supreme Economic
Council, as in Russia. For a time, indeed,
it looked as if the entire Bolshevist pro-
gramme would be adopted, with a Red Army
to consummate it. and the. feelings of Theo-
dore, the Queensland Premier, found vent in
the cry that “you might as well drop the
term ‘Labor’ and call it the Communist
party.” But these words started a rally, in
the course of which the White Australia
policy was placed on the “fighting” platform,
and it was resolved that the socialistic goal
should be reached via “the constitutional
utilisation of industrial and Parliamentary
machinery.” Pressing its advantage, the
Theodore faction moved that “the party
does not seek to abolish private owner-
ship, even of any of the instruments
of production, where such instrument is
utilised by its owner in a socially
useful manner.” And, having thus labelled
themselves socialistic individualists, the
delegates dispersed. There was not
nearly so much Bolshevism about the Mel-
bourne affair. That conference, indeed, re-
fused to let avowed Communists join the
Labor party, whether as an organisation
or as individuals. It even drew’ up an anti-
communist formula for inclusion in the six
A.L.P. constitutions. It also rejected a
proposal for a levy on capital, designed,
according to its author—a gentleman named
Duefy —to wipe out the war ddbt and
finance a motherhood endowment scheme.
But a weakness for compromise then be-
IRRITATION TACTICS.
“Secret instructions are being issued to the Waterside Workers’ Union to adopt an irritation policy
which will result in the deterioration of cargoes on the wharf and in the hold. At knocking-off time
perishable goods in the slings will be left exposed.”

came evident. There was a feeble com-
promise on the national-defence issue, a sort-
of-a-kind of constructional programme being
coupled with a resolution that under no
circumstances would citizen soldiers be sent
abroad —which means, among other things,
that under no circumstances will citizen-
soldiers of other nations come here, except
in a hostile spirit. There was another com-
promise, even more abject, on the question
of the ballot-box knavery in N. S. Wales,
conference first supporting the N. S.
Wales Labor executive, which expelled the
four politicians it held responsible, and then
referring the whole matter to the arbitra-
ment of Theodore, who had voted for re-
admitting the four. The rest was mostly
vote-catching. One resolution declared that
every family man should get the Pidding-
ton basic wage— £s 16s. a week—whether
he earned it or not. Another affirmed that
the 44-hour working week should be pro-
vided for in the Commonwealth Constitution.'
Since Australia isn't producing enough to
maintain even the present wage-rates on a
4S-liour basis, it would be interesting to
know how the proposed boons are to be
financed. But the delegates made no at-
tempt to answer the unanswerable.
*
Landlines, Airlines and Cables.
Under the agreement between the Common-
wealth Government and the Marconi Co.
the average daily period of communication
between England and Australia by beam
wireless is to be seven hours. An interrup-
tion of even half an hour in the flow of com-
munication betwen the two countries by the
cable system leads to serious congestion and
angry complaints from merchants, who, accus-
tomed regularly to despatch their wires at
the close of the business day, have a reason-
able expectation of finding the reply on their
office desks when they return the next morn-
ing. So a system which cannot promise that
it will not be silent for 17 hours out of every
24 is likely to provoke more bad language
than anything else. Hence also, no doubt, the
Pacific Cable Board’s determination to proceed
with the duplication of the submarine route via
Canada. What may seem reactionary is
the Board’s proposal* to revert to the old
simplex method of working. In the early
days of submarine telegraphy this was the
universal way. Pressure of traffic forced on
the cable companies the alternative of im-
proving the capacity of existing lines or
laying fresh cables at a cost that gave no
prospect of profit. The discovery that, by
a comparatively simple device installed at
each end of a cable, the one wire could be
made to pass messages going both ways at
once, revolutionised the business. The
“balance,” as it is culled, is, however, pre-
carious at high speeds and witli the sensi-
tive receiving instruments now in use; and
as enormous speeds are made possible by the
use of “permalloy,” a compound of nickel
and iron, in the composition of the cable,
duplex is regarded as no longer necessary, and
the old method has been reverted to. The
aspect of communications to which the Com-
monwealth Government, for its part, might
turn its mind is the improvement of condi-
tions at this end. Whereas communication
between Australia and England is year in
and year out practically continuous, and the
average delay on messages is not much more
than three hours, communication between
the various Australian capitals is precari-
ous, irregular and comparatively inaccurate.
There arc so many alternative cable routes
from Australia to the outside world that only
a cosmic cataclysm could completely isolate
this continent. But the cutting off of Syd-
ney from Melbourne, or Melbourne from
Adelaide, and all of them from Perth and
Darwin occurs every time a local storm blows
a tree across the wire at Deniliquin, or a
thirsty boundary-rider on the overland climbs
a pole and cuts it for the help that will
come when the line party arrives to mend
the break. Minor interruptions causing
delay, mutilations and loss of messages are
of daily occurrence. Some of the trouble due
to lack of alternative routes, faulty insula-
tion and too wide spacing of the telegraph-
poles is avoidable: but a good deal of it is
inherent in landline working, and puts our
present system of internal communication
in the same class with our wonderful rail-
way system as far as military purposes are
concerned. There seems to be a clear case
here for either commercial wireless com-
munication between the principal centres of
population, or the linking up of Sydney,
Melbourne and Adelaide by coastal cables, just
as Brisbane is joined to Sydney and Adelaide
to Perth. And while they are at it, the
claims of Darwin might be considered. The
two frail landlines connecting Adelaide with
Cinderella-up-north carry not only tne
domestic correspondence of the overland, but
all the traffic of Australia with Asia, and.a
big proportion of the European traffic as
well.

“C. Coral” : Further reports are coming in
from the Torres Strait natives regarding
new reefs, and “spots” (isolated patches of
hidden reef are meant) arc unexpectedly
manifesting themselves in various parts.
Whether this is natural growth or the result
of some submarine disturbance I don’t know;
but, anyway, it means that boats using that
part of the ogean should keep a sharp look-
out. The natives report that off Stephen
Island a ship’s masts are showing up at low
tide now; there have been any number of
wrecks in that locality, of course, but this
particular one was not visible previously.
The lighthouse authorities are erecting a
permanent beacon at Bramble Cay, a bit to
the north of this spot; but it looks as if
some more charting should be done there-
abouts as quickly as possible.
♦
“Sax”: Is there no remedy for a man whose
life has been blasted by wrongful arrest?
In the Irene Tuckerman case in Mel-
bourne there were two “suspects.” The
name of one has never even been disclosed
by the police; the other (Cheshire) was
arrested and committed to take his trial for
murder on evidence so weak that the case
was abandoned almost as soon as it was
brought. Cheshire had his suburban post-
office work taken from him, his business
ruined and his money absorbed by legal ex-
penses : his wife's health was seriously
affected, and the stigma cast on him is in-
delible. No compensation can ever be
adequate, but it does not appear that any
has even been offered by the Government.

“Hambone” : I doubt if there is much for
the dailies to whoop about in the an-
nouncement that the Ford Motor Co. is
going to establish “assembling and body-
building” plants in Australia. In Sydney,
Melbourne and Adelaide the assembling and
body-building plants already established by
local cos. are sufficient to turn out all the
tin Lizzies Australia is likely to want for
many years to come. They have been doing
it for years, under protection of the tariff
wall. Wliat is more, they have made such
a good job of it that an Australian body on
a Ford almost obscures its mal-DetroitneSS.
I suspect that Henry begrudges the profits
made by the pioneering Australian body-
builders, and figures on either buying out flip
local plants or cutting them out with his own.
In either case the body-buihling profits will go
to the U.S. instead of remaining in Australia.
Whatever may be his plans, it is hard to
see how Australian industry can benefit
much, for newly-increased plants at Redfern
and Waterloo (Sydney) are now only half-
staffed because they cannot obtain sufficient
orders for bodies. It would be a different
matter if Ford proposed to build the whole of
Lizzie here. Canada made him do it with
her tariff; why can’t Australia?

Forty of the Macdonalds slaughtered —
another Massacre of Glencoe!
Ramsay Macdonald, bidding fareAvell to
his greatness, said that, considering the un-
employment about, he didn’t envy Baldwin
his restored job. Probably Baldwin doesn’t
envy himself his own job. He has a tremen-
dous majority, yet is pledged not to use it
in the only Avay which Avould greatly help
British manufactures and his own reputation
—the establishment of a frankly Protection-
ist tariff. Judged by the election results it
is quite likely that a referendum would give
a solid majority for Protection; but the
referendum would be a dreadful innovation
in the land of Bullstodge.
Representatives of Queensland cotton-
growers have been in Sydney meeting the
Britisli-Australian Cotton Assoc. —“Baca”
for short. Noav that the stupid embargo on
ratoon has been removed the Queensland
grower is in much better heart; but he natu-
rally doesn’t want a middleman to squeeze
him dry. “Baca” has satisfied his representa-
tives that it wants first and foremost to get
a big cotton industry established, and it lias
therefore given the growers a long option
over all the co.’s physical assets in Queens-
land at a valuation; and meantime, so that
they may know as much about the business
as the present directors, four of their nomi-
nees can go on to the Board. It looks like
very generous treatment.
Victoria has slightly more than 40,000
Government employees. McPherson, who
ought to know —lie was behind the scenes for
six years as Treasurer —says there are far
too many, and that a service Board ought to
be appointed to do some judicious weeding-
out. So long as Labor is in charge there is
not the slightest chance of this being done;
and, as McPherson didn’t do it either when
he was Treasurer, it looks as though no
Government will do it until an over-burdened
public drives some Ministry to it.
The dead Avail in the way of paper-money
devices with no gold backing—a device which
some Australian Labor people still want us
to monkey with—is the question of realisa-
tion. Smith has, say, £lO,OOO worth of
paper secured on all the property and people
in Australia in the largest and most unspeci-
fied way imaginable. He wants to realise
on this and turn it into foreign currency, or
something saleable in foreign parts, because
he is leaving the country. Having a general
lien on everything he proposes to take Tom
Walsh’s furniture; and in the failure of this
and every other attempt to realise on the
security, all he realises is that lie has no
security at all.
While Theodore has been helping to dish
the Reds in Melbourne the man whom he
hopes to succeed as Priminister has been
touring Queensland to get first-hand facts
about the sugar industry. It is one more
proof that he takes his job seriously; the
average Priminister would have remained be-
hind for tlje Cup. At Mackay Bruce men-
tioned that when Baldwin was in office last
year Britain taxed foreign-grown sugar £25
13s. 4d. a ton, but granted Australia a pre-
ference of one-sixth. It Avas arranged at the
Economic Conference, subject to Parliamen-
tary ratification, that these rates should con-
tinue for ten years, but Baldwin went out
of office, and in Clumsy Macsliufflc’s first
Budget the duty was reduced to £ll 13s. 4d.
This year 75,000 tons Avill have to be ex-
ported to Britain, and it was reckoned that
the difference between the Labor preference
(the one-sixth was retained) and Baldwins
would cost the Australian growers £163,000.
But with Baldwin back in harness portion
at least of this amount may be saved.
Justice Powers mentioned in the Common-
wealth Arbitration Court last week that the
Germans are Avorking 60 hours per week for
the equiA-alent of 6d. per hour. In the sajne
week the N.S.W. branch of the Australian
Railways Union demanded a six-hour work-
ing day, “with tivo clear holidays per Aveek” ;
the president of the Northern (N.S.W.) Coal-
miners insisted on a four-hour day ; the New-
castle coal-trimmers refused to trim after
4 p.m., and the wharf-lumpers in most of
the States (Melbourne is standing out) de-
cided that 5 p.m. should be the knock-off
time. The immediate object in the last two
instances is to drive returned-soldicr wharfies
not in the Waterside Workers’ Federation
off the Sydney wharves; and there are high
hopes that other unions will join in “the
overtime strike,” as it is called. Compared
with the tinpot tyrants who organise these
work-stoppages, and the prating numskulls
who chyjior for the right to loaf, Fritz, toiling
his 60 hours a Aveek to get his country out
of the mud, is a figure to be respected—and
dreaded.
The easiest thousand a year in Australia
is that drawn by Senator George Foster, of
Tasmania. Foster appears in the House
just for a few minutes on the day his seat
Avould be forfeited if he remained away.
He never speaks, never votes. Accord-
ing to the affidavit of a money-lender who
has been trying to press a writ into Foster’s
reluctant hand, the Senator comes from
Sydney to Melbourne to take his seat every
tAvo months—and goes back on the train
the same day. There couldn’t be a stronger
argument for the institution of the recall.
Those who had grinned cynically at men-
tion of the reform movement in the N. S.

“Mr. O. K. Snowball’s Easier Divorce Bill is being vigorously opposed by Vic. women’s societies
and various religious bodies.”
THE ONLOOKERS: “No, no, No! We mustn’t interfere with the sacredness of the mar-
riage tie —let them fight it out!”
week whe.n the question of readmitting
Bailey, Bramston, Buckley and Sutherland
—the quartet expelled by the State A.L.P.
executive as a result of its inquiry into the
affair of the ballot-boxes with sliding panels
—was referred to Theodore for settlement.
Certainly two other Labor Premiers were
named as “arbitrators” along with the
Queenslander, but that gentleman is to sit
alone if the others refuse to act; and re-
fusal is confidently expected. For one thing,
how can Theodore afford to offend the
A.W.U., which has fought strenuously for
Bailey and Sutherland? And, for another,
how can he find for their expulsion after
siding with them at the Federal Labor Con-
ference?
The “wave of crime” rolls on in Mel-
bourne, where 122 robberies constituted a
recent week’s record in that line, with a
corresponding amount of assault, language
and sundries. Wherefore the Government
has taken up its predecessor’s unfinished
work of amending the Police Offences Act.
The amendment proceeds along the regula-
tion lines, by giving the mild and sorrowful
Bench power to make the fine more if it
feels so inclined, though it hardly ever levies
anything like the amount that is authorised
already, and permitting it to make the im-
prisonment longer, and at the same time
leaving it optional to let W. Sikes out on
his own recognisances in the old kindly way.
The amending bill also creates an extra
number of police offences, but it doesn’t pro-
vide for extra policemen or for better-paid
policemen, so the wave of crime will probably
go on much as usual.
Queensland Minister Larcombe provided
a powerful argument for New States when
defending his Government’s railway policy.
He pointed out that 41.8 per cent, of
Queensland’s railway lines are “beyond a
radius of 500 miles from the metropolis,”
whereas in Victoria all of the railways are
within this radius, and he stressed the com-
parison as showing “the enormous handicap
thrust upon the Government in administer-
ing the railway system.” Queensland rail-
ways, to follow out Larcombe’s argument,
would be in a far better position if there
were another seat of government at Rock-
hampton, for instance.
Having secured a fine large loan from some
of the once-Allied States, the Hun Chancel-
lor rather damaged the newly-established
harmony by announcing that Germany was
in no sense responsible for the war, and is
to-day, in fact, a maligned and misunderstood
angel. As somebody must have been respon-
sible, the inference is that somebody owes the
Hun an apology and a lot of indemnity. To
begin with, the Chancellor demands, among
other things, the return of all lost colonies.
Considering how much the Turk recovered by
persistent asking, and how much lie hopes
to get by more asking, Fritz evidently regards
his case as far from hopeless.
The new regulations by which Australia
gives a very handsome preference to goods
which are 75 or more per cent. British-made,
but no longer to those which are only half- or
quarter-Britisli, will, according to the Fed-
eration of British Industries, “result in
severe detriment” to many manufacturers.
It is to be hoped they will, for Britain’s sake
and for ours. When the last pint of detri-
ment in the vessel of wrath is poured into
John Bull’s cup he may decide to follow the
tariff example of countries like France and
Germany, where visitors report “there are
no unemployed.” There is nothing in imitat-
ing the toothless Jacobite of 1800 and hold-
ing on, for fie sake of tradition and the
family dignity, to the cause that was lost
in 1746.
The Canberra egg approaches hatcliing-
day, and the Chief Hen in charge makes
an attempt at enthusiasm, tempered by a
natural desire that the buyers of leases won’t
become wild and allege misrepresentation.
The advt. describes the place as “the Mecca
of the Commonwealth,” Mecca being an un-
progressive town, much avoided by Chris-
tians, and also as “the first city of the
Commonwealth.” It is foreshadowed that
in 1929, when Parliament lias been on the
spot for three years, the population, “on a
conservative estimate,” will soar to 5000—
1000 officials, their 1500 dependants and
2500 others! Hopes are expressed elsewhere
that in time this continental metropolis will
surpass Menindie; but these don’t amount
to a promise.
Premier Prendergast’s boldness is carry-
ing him through awkward times in the Vic.
Assembly. For instance, Peacock, the Oppo-
sition leader, moved that the debate on the
Motor-’Bus Bill be adjourned—this after
the Ministry had given a pretty plain inti-
mation that it was going on till it got the
second reading. The Ministry didn’t hesi-
tate and won by 10 votes. Then it went to a
division on the second reading and scored
again by 30 to 16. Six Cockies and Jimmy
McLachlan, Independent, rushed to its aid.
As some of the Cockies in Vic. Assembly
won’t serve under any other Premier than
their own Jock Allan, the Libs, are willing
to let the member for Rodney have a try at
ousting Labor. They are ready to help him
into office if he will form an all-wool Country
Party Cabinet from the following of 17 he
has in the two Houses. This is the suggested
alternative to a Composite Cabinet in which
Allan would be deputy-leader and have five
colleagues—the other six to be Libs, and
Independent Libs. In addition to the usual
week-end respite of five days, Allan was
given an additional day—due to the Cup
adjournment—to chew over the problem.
The population of Sydney is 26,000 more
than it was a year ago, and the Water Board’s
secretary has reported that on October 15
the water reserve was 28 per cent, less
than at the same date last year. And last
summer was a cheerless time. Before relief
comes they may have to request the unoccu-
pied classes to leave for wetter parts, so that
the occupied classes may be at least half-
washed. The people who have looked after
Sydney have concentrated altogether too
much on the pride of having “the greatest
city south of the line,” with too little regard
for the fact that the evaporation is great
and the rainfall in the country behind
nothing extraordinary. In 1922 (the statis-
tics are complete to that point) Sydney
people got 44} gallons each per day. Mel-
bourne used 59J gallons and had water to
spare.
No good is done the White Australia
policy by the production of pumpkin and
candle bogeys. Ilal Colebatch, Agent-Gen-
eral for W.A., a gentleman of usually sober
mind, has been telling the Victoria League
in. London that 30 million Javanese close
to our empty North menace Australia’s
existence. The alleged menace really num-
bers 50 million,, but as this horde mainly
consists of simple, sarong-clad peasants, and
as the Dutch Government that looks after
them hasn’t been able to induce them to
immigrate from the overcrowded parts of
their own islands to the empty parts thereof,
the likelihood of their going pioneering in
the Northern Territory is remote. The real
menace lies in Oie facile politician who, by
neglecting to build the railways that would
attract white settlement, leaves the way
open for the advocate of cheap coolie labor
to push his claim.
The Speck’s economy campaign has raised
the question whether the State is getting
value for its secondary schools and univer-
sity. A commission (of which Sydneysider
Peter Board was chairman) having reported
favorably on the High Schools, the opponents
of higher education at public expense were
left with nothing but. the Uni. to shoot at.
An attempt was made in Parliament to re-
duce the Uni. vote of £13,000 by various
sums. Cocky Campbell was in ' favor of
clipping off a nominal sum as an expression
of opinion, and Cocky Hobbs moved for a
specific reduction of the £BOO provided for
the Chair of Economics. The House de-
clined to endorse either proposal; but the
Agrarians were more successful in regard
to the W.E.A. tutorial classes (£1760).
which Ministers were instructed to close by
March 31 next. Even the Government had
to admit that these “workers’ ” classes had
failed to attract much patronage.
Up to date the Vic. Police Commission
which is inquiring into the strike of Novem-
ber, 1923, has cost £2300. So uninteresting
is the evidence that the dailies are either
cutting it out or relegating it to back pages.
Allan, leader of the Agrarians, grumbled at
the waste of money the other day, and
accused the Ministry of having appointed
the Commission because it wasn’t game to
carry out election promises to reinstate the
ex-police. Peacock chipped in as if Allan
was his follower or ally, and forced an expla-
nation that the Commission might finish by
Christmas. One thing pretty certain is that
if Labor stays in office Nicholson won’t be
re-appointed chief when his term is up in
April, 1925.

women survivors of the Douglas Mawson
wreck. Mrs. Lance Rawson aptly comments
on the native habit of. presenting old yarns
as new ones. “Last week” may mean two
days or 20 years ago when a story is being
spun. But I think it more likely in this
case that the origin of the story lies
in the fact that there are two white women
thereabouts —two ladies on the staff of the
Groote Eyelandt (offshoot of the Roper
River) mission, who went across for the

say.”

“Funny thing! By Jove, she made me think
I WAS proposing.”
first time a year or so ago. The presence of
two strange white women would easily start
a story like this. Incidentally, some of the
wreckage first discovered was brought in by
the Roper River mission boat. There have
been instances in the past, of course, of
women being preserved by blacks after ship-
wreck while the men were killed; one woman
was on Prince of Wales Island for four
years before being rescued. Instances of
natives interfering with white women in such
cases are very rare, supernatural fear pro-
bably having something to do with their
attitude.

the time-fuse had been removed from the
nose. If, however, the whole of the fuse
had been removed
from the pointed

been the rather

“Skipper”: How is this for a narrow
escape? One morning at Anzac two or three
men were yarning in the magazine dug-out
of a field company of engineers. An officer
was half-stooping in the low entrance, when
a shell from a French “75” owned by Jacko
passed neatly under his arm, swept between
the seated orators and plunged into a
hundredweight or so of gun-cotton. And still
nothing happened. The shell was a dud, and
the impact of the pointed projectile failed
to detonate the sudden death. As a sample
of the other sort of luck I recall a stunt at
Anzac and a black-bearded signaller of an
Indian mountain battery near us. He was
transmitting orders from the O. Pip to the
guns, when a bullet flicked across his face
and destroyed both his eyes. With Asiatic
stoicism he carried on until the stunt was
over and the order to “Stand down” was
given.

“Akran”: I knew a Digger in our bat-

wounds on different occasions without ever
reaching the front line. His first lot he
stopped in the Argyll Dere, on Gallipoli, as
he was going up to the Batt.; the rest fol-
lowed in France, where he was hit every time
he attempted to join his company. He
never reached his objective once. On
the last occasion the batt. was holding the
line at Cerisy, and he was on his way up.
A hundred yards from the front trench he
turned round and exclaimed, “I’m going to
see something at last.” He woke on a
stretcher. A coal-box lobbed, and detained
him for the eight time. This issue gave him
a trip home.

“Blink Bonnie” : Meet four people whose
domestic happiness has been wrecked—two
of them are out of a job as well —by that
cheerful form of social idiocy the “surprise
party.” A husband and wife worked to-
gether at the same tobacco factory, indulg-
ing in the mild deception of labelling them-
selves “Miss Smith” and her brother-in-law,
“Mr. Gregory,” to escape the edict which
forbids the employment of married couples.
The pair lived with Miss Smith’s sister and
husband in a cottage at Newtown (Sydney),
and the wings of peace enveloped the double
dovecot until some demon impelled her fel-
low-workers to give Miss Smith the form of
entertainment aforementioned. On the fate-
ful night a large party arrived at the cot-
tage with startling suddenness and plunged
into the insane ritual. Miss Smith was
taken aback at first, foreseeing complications,
but she retained sufficient presence of mind
to explain that Mr. Gregory was the husband

“The dame who sold me this lid said that when I put it on I

of her sister—actually the latter’s genuine
consort was away at a lodge meeting. No-
thing untoward happened until 11, when the
absent husband returned home sozzled. Miss
Smith, now thoroughly scared, sought to pass
him off as a boarder. He refused to be a
boarder. Then Mr. Gregory tried to explain
the situation to his brother-in-law in a hoarse
whisper. The explanation only enraged the
man who wouldn’t be a boarder. In a loud
voice he denounced his wife as a shameless
character, and in pungent adjectives up-
braided Miss Smith and Mr. Gregory, and
revealed their double life to the gaping
guests, who included a departmental head.
Finally the aggrieved husband tore into Mr.
Gregory, and ordered him and Miss Smith
off! the premises. Next day the departmental
manager got to work; and the Gregory-Smith

“Maeve” : Here’s tlie swiftest courtship I
know. A man rang a friend in Randwick on
a business matter. The friend was out, and
the ’phone was answered by the lady-help,
who was puzzled when the man at the other
end asked if lie could see her. She replied
that she was certainly visible. He arrived,
confided to her that lie had taken an over-
whelming fancy to her voice, and requested
the pleasure of listening to it for keeps.
There was no obstacle, she got a hat, and
a wedded pair called in at the office of the
liandwick man that afternoon to mention
that the honeymoon would be spent at
lvatoomba.

tunic. In my battalion many men, on realis-
ing this, sewed an extra button on the little
left-hand insi'de pocket of the tunic where
the field-dressing and iodine were kept. At
Buire our padre was telling some of the mob
that Billy Hughes would stick to them when
they got back to Aussie, when a big, lanky
Cornstalk gloomily demanded: “ ’Ow the
blazes does he expect us to get back when
he sent us away with 13 buttons on our
tunic?”

“Flicker”: Police headquarters in Adel-
aide are quite used to encountering bits of
quaint phraseology in the reports of officers
in charge of country stations; but official
brows were knitted harder than usual over
a recent notification from an outlying dis-
trict that “Constable Jones had been in
Blanktown attending funeral disturbances.”
A mild curiosity as to what sort of “dis-
turbances” could be associated with funerals
led to a request for further informa-
tion. It duly arrived, and showed that the
phrasing of the first report was perfectly
accurate. A prominent resident of Blank-
town had shuffled off this mortal coil, and his
obsequies were largely attended. Among
those present was li gentleman who had con-
ducted a long-standing feud with the de-
ceased, and who considered that he was still
some points behind in the score. Moved
by this consideration, he had interrupted
the officiating padre’s official recital of the
virtues of the deceased with such expressions
as “Bunkum !” “Nothing of th’ blanky kind !”
finally letting loose all bis feelings in some-
thing comprehensive and lurid. At that
point the outraged relatives intervened, and
the venue of subsequent proceedings was
shifted to the magistrate’s court.

“Harold Ilardupp”: A Melbourne station
sergeant recently had his services requisi-
tioned by a lady with a black eye, some gar-
ments wrapped up in newspaper and a story
of wrong. Unfolding the last she demanded
the immediate arrest of her husband. She
was already separated from him, it trans-
pired, but when he had paid her a visit in
a sozzled condition she had permitted him
to go to bed to sleep it off, as she did not
wish him to be pinched for drunkenness. On
awaking he had basely repaid her womanly
compassion by striking her (here she drew
attention to exhibit No. 1), and she had only
escaped after a strussgle. The sergeant sug-
gested that the miscreant, realising that she
had gone for the police, would have made
off before the Law could lay hands on him,
but the aggrieved woman promptly explained
HOPES.
“Is it your car?”
“No. But I’m marrying it shortly.”
that he couldn’t (here she unwrapped exhibit
No. 2, a pair of trousers which she had
thoughtfully impounded). And the end of
it was that a John duly gathered a man
who invited him to consider whether a woman
who was capable of rendering her husband
helpless by taking away his pants didn’t
deserve a black eye.

A BALLADE OF DIAPHANOU'S HOSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Transparent stockings are chic, but the color of
the legs must match the wearer’s complexion.”
Gone is the blouse that was peek-a-boo,
Gone to the pack where the discard goes.
Build me a ballade of fashions new,
Lilt me a lay of transparent hose.
Surely too faerie a theme for prose,
Gossamer fabrics that limbs encase ;
See to it, though, that they don’t disclose
Colors that clash with the wearer’s face.
Roses-and-cream are the cheeks that you
Give or deny to beseeching beaus?
Whether your eyes be brown or blue,
Grey or as black as the wings of crows
Is but a detail, I suppose.
But ponder on this a little space:
The tinge of her nether limbs who shows
Should take good care that it match her face.
Patrician-pale you may be in hue,
Like chiselled marble or virgin snows;
Or tanned, mayhap —cliacun a son gout —
With some piquant freckles about the nose.
You may be a lily or eke a rose,
But when diaphanous wear you place
(And the legs within) where the limelight glows
Be certain first that they match your face.
Envoy.
Chic ? Not a doubt of it. Modish, too.
But hearken, Sadie, and mark me, Grace,
Only when tints that come stealing through
The wispy coverings match the face.

“Accused; ‘I admit being drunk, but deny the

Sergeant Fcnnessy: ‘Where is your husband?’ Accused:
‘I have been on the booze for two or three days,

When Kate goes on the ginny jazz,
She makes the pace a snorter,
But feels secure—she knows she has
A husband to support her.
The envy is she of her sex,
For well-known Lil and Polly
The “vag.” their care-free lives may vex
If they get too dashed jolly.
Just where he is she cannot say,
But in a few days’ boozing,
Why, any lady might mislay
The husband of her choosing.
She meets the Court in trustful pride,
Of stale gin somewhat fragrant,
But confident no blushing bride
Could e’er be judged a vagrant.
Alas! for her a “stretch” is set—
Her memory to blame is:
She knew she had a husband, yet
Could not think what his name is.

“Coot”: The periodic imaginative young-
ster turned up at a Melbourne suburban
private hospital the other day with a pitiful
tale of a mother who had died recently, leav-
ing her a 14-year-old and friendless orphan
in N. S. Wales. A boarder had sold her
mother’s property and taken her by train to
Albury, where he had deserted her ; she had
travelled to Melbourne alone, sleeping on the
Spencer-street station platform that night.
Buying a paper next morning, she had seen
the advertisement of a hospital job, and had
come to apply for it. After this exhausting
fictional effort the girl broke down ; subse-
quent investigations disclosed that she had
really slept at her own home in Malvern the
previous night, and had never been out of
the environs of Melbourne. She blamed the
“flickers” and sensational novels for her ro-
mancing, and was restored to the care of a
worried mother.
INCONTINENCE.
“I hear old Mrs. Tompkins is a grandmother again.”
“Good gracious! And she's over seventy. She ought to he
ashamed of herself!”
“Nikko”: Human remains as souvenirs
(B. lf>/10/’24) are quite likely to lead to
unpleasant complications. An uncle of mine,
a sea captain, annexed on one of his voyages
a human skull; for many months it lay
under our house, until a small boy, searching
for bones to augment his Christmas money,
included it in his periodic transaction with
the rag-and-bone man. The buyer showed
the skull, merely as a matter of interest,
to the local policeman, and then things be-
gan to happen. The John Hop. after some
inquiries, sent in a report to 11. Q., which re-
sulted in an inspector and two assistants
arriving to harass our family, who knew no-
thing about the skull except that it had
once reposed under the house. The police
asserted that there had been a mysterious
disappearance in the locality 20 years before,
and stated that the coronial inquiry would
probably take place in a week’s time. Mean-
while a photo of the relic appeared in the
local paper, and also one of the street, with
our house marked with a huge X. We all
felt the eye of suspicion upon us when we
walked abroad, and then someone submitted
tlie skull to a learned savant. He pro-
nounced it Melanesian, and thus redeemed
our reputations. The closing items were the
furious indignation of the captain on his
return to port, and the demand of the rag-
and-bone man for the refund of 10d., the
skull-expert having added the exhibit to his
collection.
CARRY ON!
“Harry “Harry kissed me at the pictures last night.”
“What did you say?”
“I told him if he did things like that in the dark I never wanted to see his face again.”
“Light Horse”: Re scraps between men of
different services and regiments (B.
16/10/’24), some of the feuds in the British
Army are generations old, dating back to
incidents of the Peninsular and Indian wars.
There has always been a grudge between
infantry and cavalry, and this was repeated
in a mild fashion between the A.I.F. infan-
try and light horse. English garrison towns
like York or Colchester used to be lucky
if at least one serious encounter between in-
fantry and cavalry regiments did not take
place annually. The infantry used their
belts, as “Ex-Dig.” says, while the “Right-o’-
tlie-Line” took off the walking-out spurs
worn with Wellington boots and overalls in
those days and used them as knuckle-
dusters. At Maitland camp, near Cape Town,
in December, 1900, a strong detachment of
a famous English Hussar regiment, known
to its enemies of
the Old Service as
“theTh r e e s
Ab o u t,” were
“lying” with a lot
of Australian and
Canadian details.
The “irregulars”
soon dropped to
the Word of Shame
and employed it
freely. The Hus-
sars came off badly
in the individual
scraps; so one
night they fell
upon the Austra-
lian and Canadians
sleeping in their
lints; and there
was some rough
and willing work
in the dark. The
origin of the fam-
ous “Threes About”
order (cavalry
drilled in threes
and not fours in
those old days) was
doubtful. Some
said it was this re-
giment’s rearward
move at Fuentes
D’Onoro which
caused the cutting-
off of Ramsay’s
horse-guns; others
that the “duck” was done at Chilianwallah
in the Sikh wars. Lots of us asked about
it, but the replies were always non-instruc-
tive.
* * * *
“Sixenate”: The simple faith that some
people have in the efficacy of a newspaper
advertisement dies hard; witness the fre-
quency of the “Unless I hear from my hus-
band by such-and-such a date I intend to re-
marry” announcement. But perhaps it pays.
In four bigamy trials at Melbourne last year
the accused parties sought to mitigate their
offence by claiming that they had advertised
without result; and the Courts, however
irrationally, seemed to be always swayed by
the plea. It is a sequence of the security
obtained by debtors who announce that they
will no longer be responsible for liabilities
contracted in their name. But even that; is
being overdone. A Melbourne citizen, sued
for money due the other day, produced an
advt. in which he had set forth to all whom
it might concern that he would be no longer
responsible for debts contracted by himself;
and he seemed to regard the Bench as a
biased body because it flatly ignored the
printed word.
* * * *
“H.H.” : The frequently expressed opinion
about the slackness of the Melbourne police
is not shared by an Essendon citizen. A
lodge night was his official excuse for arriv-
ing home in the early hours, and delicate
consideration for his sleeping wife caused
him to seek entry to his house by an open
window. While doing so he was violently
seized from behind by ungentle hands. With
liis mind full of newspaper stories of recent
hold-ups he extricated himself from the win-
dow and turned determinedly on his assail-
ant. It was a merry mill, with the cackling
of disturbed fowls and the barking of all
the dogs in the neighborhood for accompani-
ment ; not till it was over did the house-
holder learn that the person sitting grimly
on his chest was a policeman in plain clothes.
The explanation took place before a large
audience of neighbors whose upper windows
made an undress circle; and apart from the
physical damage sustained in the encounter
the late-homing citizen is probably still pay-
ing such penalties as an outraged wife may
consider adequate.
* * * *
“C.P.S.”: Domestic tragedy finds its way
into the country courts, too. A wife apply-
ing for maintenance said she found a note
signed “Bill” on the breakfast table. “Dear
Mary,” it ran; “with the assistance of God,
I mean to leave home to-day.” In another
case the P.M. asked the deserting husband
why he had left his “poor wife.” To this he
replied: “Well, your Worship, we’d made
it up over an’ over again, an’ I said ‘Now
this is the last time,’ an’ we went home to
tea quite friendly. There was ham an’ beef
on the table an’ raspberry jam. We had
grace by a Salvation lass she asked in, an"
everything was goin’ first-rate when out the
old woman broke, an’ blow me if she didn’t
get the Salvation Army lass down on her
knees to pray for me in the awfullest lan-
guage you ever heard. Now, half a man
couldn’t stand that, could he?”
“Cartot”: I hold that the English practice
of telling a condemned man the exact date
and hour at which he is to be executed is
far more humane than the French one of
leaving him in ignorance until the very last
moment (B. 23/10/’24). There is no terror
like that of the unknown. In France, too,
the news of a reprieve or of a commutation
of sentence is conveyed to the person await-
ing the guillotine just as abruptly as the
intimation of his approaching end would
be. There is no fixed period which must
elapse between sentence and execution; con-
sequently the condemned man lives in a
hell of terrible anticipation, never knowing
at what moment he may be informed that
he is to die in a few minutes or that his life
his been spared. Picture the prisoner every
morning straining his ears for a footfall in
the corridor that may mean death or life!
Men go insane under the strain, and I have
been told of one whose shrieks could be heard
all over the prison every time that the bolt of
his cell-door was touched. The English sys-
tem at least gives the condemned man a
chance of becoming resigned to the inevit-
able.
* * * *
“Ex-Dig.”: Death came to soldiers in
almost incredible ways. One bright day at
Brandenmolen, near Ypres, Fritz was send-
ing over big shells to seai-ch for artillery
possies on one side of Middlesex-road, but
they were falling so far over that working
parties on the same side of the road took no
particular notice. Suddenly a big one landed
right amongst them ; but the crowd flattened
and sustained no casualties. The one victim
of that shot was on the other side of the
road, nearly a quarter of a mild away, climbing
down into a dugout. To get him the shell-
splinter which did the long journey had to pass
through the apex of an “A” of timber. After
that, it had to strike the unfortunate man’s
tin hat right on the join of the rim and the
crown—a variation of a fraction of an inch
would have 'deflected it. Striking true, it
holed through the metal into the brain. The
chances against that flying piece causing that
casualty must have been millions to one, and
the incident sticks in my memory as having
“put the wind up properly” for the first time.
It was an illustration that death was likely to
come anywhere and in any circumstances.
* * * *
“Blink Bonnie” : A clerical friend with a
cure of souls out Leichhardt (Sydney) way
guarantees this. One Friday night when the
late shoppers were streaming homewards
past his rectory the door-bell rang, and his
housekeeper admitted a young man and a
factory Lizzie who were tired of single
blessedness. After his reverence had jotted
down particulars and arrangements, the
bridegroom-elect put another question. “Say.
would yer do a doubler at a reduction? If
you will I think me brother will click with
his shiela, and we’ll make a day of it.”
• * * *
“Merris”: On the Greek island of Lemnos,
at the hot springs of Thermos, I bathed in
a marble bath. Since then I’ve had to put
up with “Doulton,” cast-iron and even plain
galvanised. But at the Robe Hotel, in
the south-east of South Aus., recently, I
again made contact with polished marble.
At Thermos the bath was formed of slabs
cemented together, but at Robe it had been
cut from a single block of stone; it is over
7ft. long and oOin. deep. Tradition has it
that an early-day slieep-king imported the
“O LOVE, THE BEAUTIFUL AND
BRIEF.”
“I've had two offers of marriage and I don't
know which to accept.”
“Don't worry, my dear—one man's alimony
is as good as another's.”
bath from Italy to please liis lady, and when
he sold out Bung bought it for a couple of
pounds. At Thermos the hot water gushes
through the open mouth of a marble lion.
At Robe it enters the bath via a chip-heater
through a common or brass tap.
BALLADE OF FLOWERS THAT BLOOM IN

“Summer begins for the Vic. police on October
'I 5, when the dingy garb of winter is replaced by
brighter attire. On that day, white summer helmets
are worn in the city streets for the first time.”
Sing hey ! ’Tis the season with sunlight fraught,
The jocund, jubilant turn o’ the year,
When woollens are banished and sunshades bought
And they put three shifts to the brewing of beer ;
Its positive affirmation clear,
That man of his last misgiving rids,
Has gladdened our eyes, for far and near
The Johns have sported their summer lids.
Though the sun scarce shines as we think he ought,
Yet we’ve a warrant that Spring is here
With lawful, visible mean* of support,
Her witnesses by the score appear;
Though the wind may pish and the raindrops sneer,
Their dazzling, legal assurance bids
Doubt move on. and make room for cheer—
The Johns have sported their summer lids.
Of all the blossoms by poets sought,
Not the snowdrop poised on her slender spear,
Not the white rose flooding its frail support,
Nor the whiter lily that stars the mere
Can rival the bloom of this fair compeer
Whose pearly splendor adroitly kids
Citizens out of their winter gear—
The Johns have sported their summer lids.

Oh Flora, bountiful goddess dear,
To the tender fancy as countless quids,
Behold the crown of your bright career—

“The Magistrate (sarcastically) : ‘What were you
doing on Princes Bridge—thinking of going to work?’
‘Oh, no, sir! I was going to the St. Kilda-road.’”
The day may have its dust and heat,
Its cares that cark and irk;
From Carlton down to Flinders-street
There’s never-ending work.
But, day or night, your heart grows light,
And trouble drops its load,
When you have passed o’er Princes Bridge
And reached St. Kilda-road.
The dusty streets are left behind,
The heavy vans forgot;
The very atmosphere, you’ll find,
Is different—a lot.
On green-lined ways a man may gaze
Where pleasure is the mode,
When he has passed o’er Princes Bridge
And reached St. Kilda-road.
Not all can live St. Kilda way,
Or ’d care to if they could ;
But every man can round his day
With pathways near as good.
His rooftree calls when evening falls;
His thoughts thereon bestowed,
He passes o’er his Princes Bridge
To his St. Kilda-road.

The WILDCAT
COLUMN
Smith’s Newspapers, Ltd. (Sydney).—
Tliis co. was formed last year to acquire
Smith’s Weekly and found and conduct
the Daily Guardian. The accounts now
issued for 14 months to the end of June
show:—
Loss on the Guardian.. .. £101,378
Smith's Weekly profit .. £36,141
Sundry earnings .. .. 1,276
37,417
Net loss .. .. •• •• £63,961
The co. is in 300,000 £1 shares,, half ordi-
nary, half 0 p.c. cum. pref. The latter
were sold to the public; the former were
issued to Joynton Smith and his partners,
100,000 of them for goodwill and 50,000 for
tangible assets. When the present accounts
were made up dividends had been paid
on the pref. capital to the end of March;
charging up the interest for the last quarter
the co. winds up the year £78,681 short,
(this assumes that the last quarter will call
for tb(> same interest as the third quarter).
In drawing up accounts there is, however,
a plan by which you may eat your cake
and have it too. ‘‘it is true,” they say, "we
have spent £78,681 more than we have
earned in money; but look at the goodwill
we have acquired.” So £lOO,OOO is added
to the other £lOO,OOO already in the goodwill
account, and the Profit and Loss account
says: “Balance, being aggregate net profit
for the period, £36,039.” Incidentally, Smith,
Johnson and Co., the auditors, say: “Subject
to the remarks contained in our report of
even date, we are of opinion that such
balance-sheet is properly drawn so as to
exhibit a true,” etc. That report should
surely have accompanied the published
accounts.
• • • • • •
Goodwill is, broadly, the capacity to earn
profits. The directors say that “to-day
the two papers combined are earning hand-
some profits after providing for pref. divi-
dend.” It seems to be a fair conclusion
from this statement that at October 22 the
Guardian was not making profits. Still,
goodwill might fairly be asked for a pro-
perty not at the moment making profits, but
moving aparently in that direction. Whether
£lOO.OOO is a fair thing to pay for what the
Guardian has accomplished is purely a
matter of opinion. Sydney Daily Tele-
graph’s shares are quoted at about 235. As
at Dec. 31 last that co. had net tangible
assets valued at £407.536, about half of it
liquid. There were 355,560 shares; so the
net tangible assets were a few pence under
235. per share. The market is thus valuing
the Daily Telegraph’s goodwill at only a
few pence per share. However, the public
is interested only in Smith’s prefs.; and
they stop at 9 p.c. That takes but £13.500
a year. Smith’s Weekly can carry that
easily enough unless it gets loaded with debt.
On June 30 the co. had net tangible assets
of only £124,659; so that, so far as security
for capital is concerned, the prefs. are
already a bit short.

This co. has not done much for itself so
far, but it has done fine things for Australia.
Only a few years ago there was a pretty
general idea that the Australian might make
a rough pair of boots perhaps, and a wine
that you might drink if you weren’t at all
particular; but as for producing goods that
demanded high skill, accuracy or taste —well,
what could you expect? This co. decided
that it could expect of Australians what it
could expect of anybody else; and when it
announces that to-day it is employing 800
people and paying in wages and salaries
more than £150,000 a year, the “Wild Cat”
leaves off figuring long enough to wireless
three cheers and the hope that next year it
will have to write at least a 10 p.c. m the
dividend column. ....
The depressing figures shown in the last
line of the table are not as bad as they look.
Originally the co. depended upon ordinary
wirelessing. Then broadcasting came in with
a rush. The Government did not know
where it was; and it took some time to find
out. During this period of indecision the
co. lost heavily. The change in the broad-
casting regulations alone cost directly
£13.373; and a loss of £11,975 was made by
the subsidiary Australectric, Ltd., chiefly be-
cause it had to mark time while the Govern-
ment decided what it was going to do. The
old confusion has, however, ended ; listening-
in has become almost as popular as jazz;
and it looks as though in a very few years
wireless will be in as many houses as tele-
phones. Whether this co will get as much
out of it as it ought to remains to be seen.
Still, this is sure: there are more fish in
its sea than ever there were before. It may
be disappointed with regard to long-distance
work; but a vast field will probably open in
connection with inter-State_ work. Here the
Federal telegraph service might be very glad
to pass on some of its business —the press
business, for example.
But the investor who wants to see 20s.
worth of realisable assets for his £1 had better
not look this way. Here is the position :

In hundreds of homes in South Aus. Elder-
Smith’s is quite one of the family ; and as
the State has had a wonderful run of good
years the co.’s plate has been piled high. For
many years it was rather old-fashioned, and
suited S. Aus. none the less on that account;
then one after the other of the old colleagues
of Thomas Elder and R. Barr Smith fol-
lowed those big men, and its control got into
younger hands. Great changes followed.

£2,175,008; and “Government stocks, cash on
hand and money at short call” stand at
£1,270,451. One wonders why the co. is tak-
ing deposits to hold in that way. The “ad-
vances, etc.,” include goods and shares in
other cos.; and as the total is only a little
more than half a million in excess of the co.’s
own capital and reserves, the creditors are
as safe as they think they are. Or probably
most of them never think of such a thing
as unsafety in connection with Elder-Smith’s.
The profits for the year were exceptional;
still the average for the past seven years lias
averaged just about 16 p.c. on the capital,
so there is plenty of margin for the 10 p.c.
dividend. Certainly the capital has been
increased very rapidly, and it isn't easy to
earn 10 p.c. on large volumes of new money.
But it has to be noted that in the five years
1913-17, before the big movement started,
the profits averaged more than 22 p.c.
on capital. On the law of averages leaner
years may be due in South Aus. But there
are few cos. better prepared to meet them;
and with exceptionally high prices, and there-
fore exceptional commission and other earn-
ings. it will be still better prepared before the
pinch comes. The directors are, at any rate,
so well satisfied with the outlook that the
authorised capital has been increased from
£2.000,000 to £3,000,000; and 40,000 shares
(they are all of £10) will be offered next
January to then holders of old shares —one
for every five. At the same time good cus-
tomers will be sweetened by the offer of
10.000 shares. This will make the paid capi-
tal £1.000.000, in 250,000 shares paid to £6.
The fact that they all carry a liability of £4
may hold some investors back ; for in this case
it is not likely that the money will be called
up until it has to be.

•Including accumulations.
This year’s profits don’t suffice to pay 0
p.c. on the inflated ordinary capital after
the prefs. hate had their small mouth-
ful. The Board’s explanation is that
“restrictions resulting from the amend-
ments of the Liquor Act seriously affected
the turnover,” and that “another adverse
feature was the absence _ of such a
large number of spending citizens at the
Wembley Exhibition.” But the 98 p.c. or
so who were left behind have been enjoying
an extraordinarily good time; and the hotel-
keeper who doesn’t expect “restrictions” of
some sort is over-sanguine. Whatever the
cause the movement of some of the figures
during the year has been distinctly unplea-
sant. For instance: —
1916. 1920. 1923. 1924.
Liabilities. . .. £69,944 £60,530 £31,442 £36,062
Liquid assets .. 4,869 22,323 12,256 11,748
Excess liabilities £65,075 £38,207 £19,186 £24,314
The co. has gone £4439 further into debt to
the bank; and there is not a thing to show
for it. Apparently the overdraft was in-
creased to pay the second moiety of the 10
p.c. div. for the year to June, 1923; and
the reduction of this year’s div. to 6 p.c.
hasn’t been sufficient to pull it down very
far. The capital never should have been
written up; actually the ordinary capital
was doubled, and the struggle to pay upon
it a dividend which will keep the shares
somewhere near par is always likely to
cause trouble. A serious question already
is whether sufficient provision is being made
for renewals; only £BOO was set aside out
of profits last year to provide for restora-
tion of plant and furniture, and whether
that is enough depends on what was actually
paid for. Nothing was cut out of profits to
provide for renewal of buildings; and though
they are comparatively new, they can’t last
for ever. As for the future, the liquor
business has its grave perils; but those very
perils will make people chary of putting
money into competing premises. Further,
it is possible that even the Drys will pre-
sently see that neither temperance nor moral-
ity is advanced by the present law, which en-
courages drinking on unlicensed premises
after 6 o’clock —to the disadvantage, of
course, of licensed premises such as Usher’s.

Australia’s sugar production in this record
year will leave about 70,000 tons for ex-
port. The embargo against importations of
foreign sugar, which holds until June next,
has insured stability to the industry, and
efforts are now being made by the growers,
aided by the Queensland Government, to
have it continued. To meet the so-called
loss on the exportable surplus—it will be
sold on the world’s market and will realise
prices below those fixed in Australia —about
£370,000 of the sugar-producers’ money is
being retained by the Sugar Control Board.
Even with this deduction they are doing
very well; and deserve to. There are patches
of good cane land south of Townsville; but
the movement is now definitely north of that
centre, because the heat and humidity there
result in higher sugar content. However,
even with the conversion of the lower cane-
lands to other purposes, Millaquin is likely
to remain an important southern outpost.
The lessened profit shown this year was
partly due to a dry spell and partly to the
reduction of £3 6s. Sd. per ton in the price
of raw sugar. However, the directors report
favorable prospects for next balance, and
that seems a safe enough bet.
Millaquin and Yengarrie were two of the
securities left on the doorstep of the Q. N.
Bank following the earthquakes of the ’nine-
ties. The land was a comparatively simple pro-
position—it could be sold. But if it were
sold the fate of the refinery might well be
uncertain. So the bank held on to the whole
outfit; and care and attention won its re-
ward in the shape of profits which played
their part in placing the Q.N. where it is
to-day. When the business was running
smoothly it was formed into a co., the whole
of the capital (£500,000) being taken by the
bank. That was early in 1011. and capital
stands unaltered to-day. The bank's plan
doubtless was to get out as opportunity
offered. But, whatever has been done in
this way, the personnel of the Board indicates
that the Q.N. interest is still dominant. The
co. has been a steady payer. For the past
12 years the average return has been 8 p.c.,
with a strengthening of visible reserves over
that period of £131.077. The co. has an in-
terest —probably substantial—in the Bunda-
berg Distillery Co., from which in 1020 it
received a bonus of £36.020. Excluding the
investments account, £65.370, liquid and semi-
liquid assets have moved as follows over the
past three years :

Liquid surplus .. £124,726 £132,711 £141,609
It is more than likely that conservative
values have been placed on assets; and be-
cause the Q.N.’s habits seem to be shared
by this co., the depreciation and renewals
account is treated as stored-up profit, and
is lumped with the reserves. Unfavorable
seasons will play their part, but the average
dividend should be maintained without diffi-
culty, assuming that reasonable Protection
is given the industry. There is. it has to be
recognised, a fairly strong southern section
which is opposed to this Protection ; but it
is not unreasonable to hope that a commu-
nity which is quite prepared to protect the
producers of boots and blankets will be will-
ing to also protect the producers of a line
whose competitors are chiefly colored people.

The amount shown in the first table as writ-
ten off is the amount added during the year
to the reserve for depreciation and renewals,
and evidently charged to working account.
The directors say that £20,000 was written
off research and development account; but
xi 9 f:o() seems to have been spent, so that
the net writing oft’ is the £7310 shown
above Perhaps the £lOO,OOO put to a special
amortisation account should be written off
too However, it doesn’t much matter: in
accounts of this kind a statement of reserves
is really not of great value, seeing that the
"Teater part of both share and debenture
capital is sunk in machinery and plant
and mines (including development) ; and
their book value is not inherent in the
asse ts —they are merely worth what they can
earn. The capital account stood on June 30:

The deferreds were issued in connection

The present dividend is at the rate of 9 p.c.
It is impossible to say exactly what the
year’s net earnings were. If we assume that
the amount written off was sufficient lo
cover depreciation, and that the amount pm
to amortisation was required to make good
the capital which is in disappearing assets,
then the co. made £80,802 besides the divi-
dends. A further dividend has been paid (at,
the rate of 9 p.c. p.a.) since the accounts
were made up.
There was a black day in Broken Hill a
little over 30 years ago. That morning Cap-
tain Piper came down from the B. 11. Prop,
with a long face and the word that they had
just got into ore from which zinc had pushed
out some of the lead. And zinc was the
devil’s other name. It couldn’t be smelted;
you couldn’t even smelt ores heavy in silver
and lead if they also carried 15 p.c. or so
of zinc. Nor was any method known for
getting the zinc out. Professor Schnabel
was brought from Germany. He knew three
and twenty ways of doing it —none of them
commercially possible. Presently in despera-
tion a makeshift mechanical process was
tried, and some sort of a crop was harvested.
But the zinc product was waste; and with
it went a vast quantity of silver and lead.
Then the sulphuric-acid or flotation process
was developed. That produced, incidentally,
a rich zinc concentrate. The Germans and
the Belgians smelted this in small clay pots.
Wales had done it, too; but it was a process
that belonged to the Dark Ages, and when the
energetic Sulphide Corporation established
works in England (despairing of getting
men to do it in Australia) most of the work-
men had to be brought across from the Con-
tinent. Meantime wonderful things were
being done in the electric deposition of
copper; and chemists and engineers were hard
at work on the extension of the process to
spelter—the name under which zinc goes to
market. Slowly the process was perfected;
and long-headed men put their hands on the
Great Lake on the Tasmanian plateau as a
likely source of cheap power. Nature not
only supplied the power; it provided handy
to it one of the finest deep-water harbors
in the world. After the usual vicissitudes,
during which most of the pioneers dropped
out, works were put up at Risdon, along-
side Hobart; and the State Government,
which had taken over the manufacture of
power, supplied the current. The co. has lately
been taking 33,0001i.p., and has contracted
for more.
And meantime there was a war; and that
helped too. The dependence of Britain on
Continental smelters horrified people who
had been often enough warned about it. and
the Board of Trade made vast purchases
of Broken Hill concentrates, and subse-
quently, besides selling 1,150,000 tons of
them to this co., contracted to take a certain
quantity of its output at a premium until
1928. On this question of marketing the
directors say that it is “perhaps the least
difficult” of their jobs. The product is “be-
coming well and favorably known through-
out the world,” and “one interesting fea-
ture is the gradually increasing quantity
being taken by Australian manufacturers.”
But that doesn’t settle the question of price.
Spelter is worth about £3B to-day. During
the four years preceding the war, including
1914, it averaged £23 15s. The co.’s pro-
duct during the year was 44,708 tons. If
the co.’s profit was £341,349, as its own
Appropriation account shows, then it made
a little under £8 per ton, being helped to
that, of course, by the high prices ruling
for silver and lead. (The concentrates it
buys contain both these metals.) It used to
be said that zinc could be produced elee-
trolytically for £l5 per ton. It doesn’t look
like it. In addition to its metallic output
the co. is going to make superphosphates.
It expects to supply all Tasmania’s require-
ments, and there is money in it so long as
the present “understanding” lasts among
producers. The question of zinc supplies
does not yet arise, and is not likely to cause
trouble for 20 years. Helped by its own
mines—only now beginning production—the
co. can reasonably expect Broken Hill to
keep it going at least that long.

Queensland looks like making something
of its zinc ores for the first time owing to
the hiali market for spelter. Most ot the
silver-lead lodes around Chillagoe carry zinc
as sulphide, but several fair bodies of white
zinc carbonate have been unearthed at Mul-
diva and Mungana, and this ore is being
calcined up to GO p.c. metal and shipped to
Germany. So far only small lots have gone,
but the business is growing rapidly. In the
south Silver Spur has just sent about 100
tons of 40 p.c. concentrates to the same cus-
tomer, and there looks like being a big future
supply there. The Ban Ban lode, near Big-
genden, the biggest zinc lod 1 in the State,
is also being worked and ore shipped.
* * * *
The Etheridge goldfield (N.Q.) is bucking
up under the impetus given to silver-lead
mining by ruling prices. A dozen shows are
sending away high-grade ore for treatment,
but most of them are only gougers’ proposi-
tions so far, although several look to have
a chance of developing into something better.
Mt. Jackson is the most important, and
F. W. Cnthbert is opening it out on a fairly
large scale. The gold returns from the field
now look sicker than ever beside the silver-
lead output.
# # # #
Queensland Mines Minister Jones is at Mt.
Isa ; from there he goes on to the newly-
revived field at Lawn Hills, from which
some very rich silver-lead ore parcels have
been sent to Burketown for shipment. The
Public Works Commission is on liis track,
and is taking evidence on the Mt. Isa pro-
posed railway and the feasibility of connect-
ing it with Burketown, via Lawn Halls. A
railway to the latter place would revive an
old field whose prospects are spoken of in
very high terms.
* * * *
New Minnie Moxliam, Mareeba (N.Q.),
smiles and frowns alternately. It was re-
opened recently, the stopes around 130 ft.
were cleaned up and a 200-ton crushing
taken out. Over the plates this gave 1640 z.,
and 4 tons of concentrates will materially
add to that. There is talk of a sft. lode
going 35dwt., but this sounds rather too opti-
mistic. Anyway, the reef has always been
bunchy; and although crushings have been
over the 2oz. mark, the amount of antimony
present has been a decided drawback.
* * * *
Brown’s Reward Co. (W.A.) has abandoned
the Hicks option at Kalgoorlie, and is look-
ing for something else. It has tried several
so-called good things, but all have turned out
badly arid made shareholders more disheart-
ened. Anyway, it is too weakly financed to
prove a mine if it got hold of one, and, like
a lot of other Adelaide cos. operating in
the West, ought to either call in sufficient
capital or go out of the business.
Hampton Celebration (W.A.) has indeed
fallen on evil days. Developments looked
sickly at depth, the manager was burnt to
death, funds gave out, and now a petition-
ing creditor is applying to the Westralian
Supreme Court to have the co. wound up.
Altogether £50,000 cash and £125,000 in
fully-paid £1 shares was paid for the show
in 1010. At that time optimists reckoned
that the property would become, a great pro-
ducer. Shares —there were 250,000 then —
soared to 505., and the knowing ones got
out. Now they can be had wholesale at a
few pence—largely because, after using up
all its capital, it, had to raise more by deben-
tures. At present operations are at a stand-
still.
* * * *
Edna May Central’s Mistletoe option at
Meekatharra (W.A.) is not turning out as
well as expected. Prospectors got a few sen-
sational crushings from a small patch, and
then stood aside while the Central looked in
vain for more. The future depends on the
discovery of fresh patches. If they exist it
is to be hoped they wall be found before the
Central loses heart and departs.
The amalgamated Freney-Okes Durack Oil
Co. (W.A.) has decided to do the following
things on Freney’s area: (1) Continue bor-
ing to 3000 ft. at Mt. Wynne in the hope that
the overlying sandstones will give place to
the limestones before that depth is reached;
(2) bore at Poole Range with the Mt. Elder
plant hitherto used by Okes-Durack Co.; (3)
arrange with the Federal Government for
Dr. Wade to again visit Poole Range and
fix boring sites. The co. also intends to test
the Okes-Durack area with a smaller plant.
Meanwhile the Board is counting the cost,
and as the carrying out of the programme of
work suggested by Dr. Wade, plus that drawn
up by the Board, will cost about £40.000, the
Government has been asked to back its ex-
pert’s opinion by giving financial help. If
this is done the Board reckons that the pro-
posed operations can be completed within
two years, while, if the co. has to stir up
shareholders for all the capital required, the
work may take years or perhaps never be
done through want of funds.
Inspector Greenaud, sent to examine the
Edjudina leases (W.A.), whither Adelaide
capital is flowing, gives the field a good
prospect. Nine or ten miles of reefs have
be<*n worked down to 200 ft. by oldtimers,
the reefs varying from a few inches to Oft.
of ore. Values won ranged from 15dwt. to
2oz. In sight remains a lot of low-grade ore
which had to be left because of high costs
of handling. The richer shoots were short —•
30ft. to 40ft. in length—and the future de-
pends on making the intermediate lode
material profitable. Greenaud believes that
this can be done if modern methods are
employed.
* * * *
Assays from the rejuvenated Peak mines
near Cobar (N.-S.W.) give 2oz. gold and
1 OJoz. silver from 114 ft. to 119 ft. in the
main north drive off the main west crosscut
at the 220 ft. level. At 119 ft. the ore is 50in.
wide. The ore in the richer patches is
highly pyritic, and galena and zinc blende
are also present. A concentrate extracted
from all the samples taken over the last
7ft. of driving showed the mineralised
material saved to contain 19oz. gold and
440 z. silver'. But bulk samples will have to
be tested before the value of the resurrection
can be determined.
* * * *
North Mount Farrell (Tas.) reports 3ft. of
high-grade galena in No. 0 level. The stopes in
this level have been of only middling value
so far, and the new discovery improves pros-
pects greatly. The co. has given £66,000 in
dividends, the last (of Is.) paid on August
11, 1924. There are 80,000 shares of £1
paid up to 16s. 6d.
* * * *
Pioneer Tin (Tas.), under Cecil Ryan, is
still producing divs. With metal up in
price, 2s. 3d. a share was paid last year.
That is not bad from a mine on its last legs.
An evenly distributed rainfall all the year
enabled Ryan to lift over 500,000 cub. yards t
to the sluice boxes, or 25 p.c. more than in ”
the previous campaign. This makes the
total output of the Pioneer 11,900,000 cub.
yards, from which 8208 tons oxide lias been
won. Average costs since 1900 are 6.436 d.,
and the average tin content of the drift
1.5461 b., whereas last year the grade was
1.3731 b. and costs 10.471 d. A better com-
parison is for 1922-23, when the drift gave
1.6511 b. with costs 9.145 d. The increase in
one direction and the decrease in the
other are both due to natural conditions.
An leads taper off in quality as depth is
attained, and with increased depth wear and
tear on plant, because of the greater lift,
adds to the charge for renewals. Ryan at
one portion of the paddock has to elevate
the dirt 130 ft., at the other part 118 ft. —
no light job. Another trouble at the Pioneer
is that the pug seams are thicker and the
bottom of the lead more cemented. To handle
this material takes money. Sluicing now
is beyond the granite bar*, which at one time
seemed to be the end of everything. Now
it can be seen that the lead is contracting
ahead, with the oxide lying on a narrow bot-
tom. What has to be settled is whether the
bar has acted as a riffle and checked the
flow of the tin down stream. Work still
goes on at the Argonaut pup near St.
Helens. It has produced 493 tons oxide from
1,293,600 cub. yards drift, at au average
cost of 7.171 d. Recent work cost over lOd.
because terrace ground had to be handled.

London backs up Lindesay Clark in his
desire to get the Briseis mine (Tas.) safe
before resuming th° payment of dividends.
While he was twisting the Ringarooma River
out of its course behind Krushka’s flat the
stripping of the heavy basalt cup over the
gutter had to stop. The best tin lies under
the rock capping, but it was thought it could
be got rid of gradually. Dry weather in the
Speck blocked this programme, and as sluic-
ing draws close to the toe of the basaltic over-
burden heavy landslips might upset all plans.
So efforts will be concentrated on getting
rid of the rock, the hope being that mean-
time enough tin will be scraped up to pay
costs. The co. has plenty of cash to stand
the strain as well as to put in the new equip-
ment needed to elevate the wash from the
open-cut faces. Clark will also hurry up the
completion of the new Cascade dam which
is to supplement the Ringarooma supply and
make up for power consumed by the bigger
lift from the bottom of the gutter. The mar-
ket doesn’t like having divs. held back, but
the policy is sound.

After hammering away since 1918, Harry
Gregory, M.H.R., has been assured by the
Customs that “for the present exporters of
metals and minerals need not be required to
furnish particulars as to consignees.” It
doesn’t look much, but it means that the
Zinc Producers’ Association will not continue
to hold powers enjoyed since 1916. whereby
the consignee in London and elsewhere could
be terrified by a threatened boycott for dar-
ing to trade outside the Z.P.A. In 1915-16.
when Hugh Mahon was Acting-Attorney-
General in the Labor Government during tbe
absence of Hughes in London, he used the
War Precautions Act to drive all base-metal
producers into one camp. The B.H.P.
objected, and Mahon gave the big concern
48 hours’ notice to come in or be forced in.
Small men had to pay £5OO entrance fee and
humbly agree to give the Z.P.A. 1 p.c. of the
proceeds for handling their ores for a period
of 50 years. The articles expressly give the
directors power to distribute largesse in the
way of “gifts to persons who directly or indi-
rectly forward the interests of the associa-
tion” —a proviso which appeared to be
expressly made in the interests of certain
politicians who set up as pooling experts
•during the war. The small man, especially
in zinc, has been forced to suspend produc-
tion for eight years because no consignee
labelled by the Customs dare risk a deal
outside the combine formed by John Higgins
and then Labor Minister Mahon.

It was 84 years on October 31 since the
first municipal elections for the city of Adel-
aide —the first held in Australia. Lawyer
.Tas. Hurtle Fisher was Adelaide’s first
Mayor; he was elected on four subsequent
occasions.
“Griffith M.” : There have been 61 Prime
Ministerships in Britain, but of course not
that number of separate Prime Ministers,
since Walpole started the habit of having a
Parliamentary chief of the Cabinet, instead
of a ruck of portfolio-holders presided over
by the Sovereign. The gentleman who has
just received notice to quit seems to be the
first one with a “Mac”, before his name, and
the first one seriously suspected of being a
Celt. The ancient race hasn’t lived up to
its opportunities.
A Bendigo resident named Fly had his
90th birthday party the other day. In the
EDWARD
DOBBS, M.H.A.,
new leader of the
Opposition in the
Tasmanian
Assembly.
generation before
last John Fly was
a grocer whose
pastime was rifle-
shooting, and in
the days of the
volunteer forces he
was also a military
officer. Another
officer of his
period was Trapp;
an d “t h e F 1 y-
Tra p p combina-
tion” was the
popular goldfields
joke of the time.
When Coeky-leader Allan gave Digger
Pollard (Labor) a prod in the Vic. Assem-
bly the other day about his youthful impetu-
osity, the new member for Dalhousie said
that he “was not too young when there were
guns about.” Later on, Pollard, interjecting
for the fifth time in three minutes, said the
man who paid £lOO in municipal rates hadn’t
two or three skins to save when there was
a war on. Getting a bit tired of it all. Allan
remarked that “the most ungraceful thing a
returned soldier could do is to talk continu-
ally about the war and what he did in it.”
A bunch of Codlins tried to sool the Diggers
on to Allan, but most of the latter agreed
with Premier Prendergast that the Cocky
leader’s remark was “perfectly innocuous.”
Col. Bourchier, Allan’s colleague, is the most
distinguished ex-soldier in the House, and he
seemed to think so too.
The, just-dead Iv.C., Herbert William
Bryant, one of the leading collectors of large
fees in Melbourne, was a Queenslander who
finished his studies down south. He and
Justice McArthur were at one time both
members of the Essendon football team. He
might have had a Judgeship in 1920, but
lie was 61 then, and decided that it wasn’t
good enough. By the way, “Toby” Barton
was his uncle.
Brig.-General T. H. Dodds, who relieved
“Tom” Griffiths for awhile at H.Q., London,
after the Armistice, goes to the British War
Office as Australian military i-epresentative
and military adviser to the High Commis-
sioner. “Tommy Dodd” hardly made a suit-
able relief for the suave and tactful Grif-
fiths : lie spent most of his time getting
apoplexy over the pretensions of the staff
men who, despite their uniforms, regarded
themselves as civilians with a right to inter-
fere freely in what Dodds regarded as mili-
tary affairs. He was glad when Griffiths
returned; and so was a staff which had
grown to regard the new chief’s office as a
volcanic area.
Sam Barnes, member for Walhalla, re-
turned to Melbourne a few days ago after
eight mont h s’
absence. Chancing
the sort of luck a
sudden dissolution
in his absence
might bring,
Barnes went away
when the fate of
the Lawson-Allan
Com p o Cabinet
was in the balance ;
but friends pulled
him through
against a formid-
able Labor attack.
One of the best-
liked members of
the House, he got
a bracing reception
as lie signed the
roll.
O. SODOMBURGE,
Adelaide's well-
knoumn sheriff.
Dr. John Harden, ardent horticulturist,
whose garden at Wentworth Falls (N.S.W.)
rivalled the natural beauty-spots of that
Blue Mountain resort, has passed out at 'JO.
He was a Victorian product of Geelong Col-
lege and of Melbourne and Sydney ’Varsities,
who gave his working life to education. For
30 years he was principal of the P.L.C. at
Croydon, and he founded the branch institu-
tion at Pymble. His beloved garden got
him for good five years ago.
Dead at 85, Richard Newton, who per-
petrated the spoof article in the Brisbane
Courier on “suspended animation” for the
export of live meat to England to be killed
when required. The article was reprinted
without comment by the Times, and the
scheme was seriously discussed by nearly
the whole press of the Cold Country. An-
other article of his was aimed at the Mcll-
wraith Government’s land-grant railway
scheme, and had a lot to do with its down-
fall. .Joining the Crimean Army at 16 with
a commission, Newton was with the 58th
Regiment in M.L. and Ireland, and in ’59
with the 34th in India during the M'utiny.
He came to Bananaland in ’62, and worked
on Amby Downs for experience, later taking
charge of Mt. Debatable, near Gayndali. He
tried his luck with sheep at Exmoor without
success, and in ’7O bought Redfern Bay
sugar plantation, only to sell out after eight
unsatisfactory years. A personal friendship
with Gresley Lukin got him his job on the
Courier for two years, after which ho
started a stock-and-station agency.
An ever-victorious politician :
r might have known the Baldwinites would win the
British election when I read, that my well-nourished
friend “Buglepumpkin” Moore, sometime of Bun-
bury (W.A.), had got another nomination for a
snug, seat in the Commons. As a political weather-
cock he is in a class of his own. The Westralians
were astonished in 1911 when Moore quitted the
Premiership for the London agency, for the man was
only 41 and his “Liberals” had a good majority.
Tneir astonishment lessened when Labor captured ais
seat at the by-election, and disappeared altogether
when the same party swept the country a few 7 nTbnths
later. Then it was realised that the stout and
amiable “Bugle,” whom nobody suspected of astute-
ness, had read the signs aright. On George Reid’s
death in 1918, Moore became M.P. for St. George’s,
Hanover-square. That seat being redistributed out
of existence, he transferred to North Islington, an
equally soft snap. At least, it was soft at the first
post-war election, but in 1922 Moore’s majority
slumped alarmingly, the Conservative vote, in fact,
being less than the Labor and Liberal votes combined ;
an! in 1923, when the tide was running heavily
against Baldwin, he discovered “urgent business in
Canada’’ and withdrew. The “urgent business” dis-
posed of, and the tide having turned, the adroit
gentleman achieved the nomination for Richmond, the
safest Conservative seat on the map, and got in
by a record majority. The reputation of being an
A.I.F. general has helped “Bugle” greatly in Britain.
Though he was never under fire, he emerged from
the war with the same rank as Rosenthal and Hobbs :
I fancy he even got his major-generalsinp before
Monash. -vnd he is quite likely to be included in
the Baldwin Ministry on the score of being “a
leader of those gallant Anzacs to whom we owe so
much.”
Sixty-six years ago this week Bishop John
McCarthy was born in Ireland. After a dis-
tinguished course in All Hallows’ he finished
up in France, and then spent the first seven
years of hi-s clerical life among the wilds of
Galway. Thirty-four years ago he came to
the Melbourne archdiocese as private secre-
tary to the late Archbishop Carr, and later
was Administrator of St. Patrick's and Vicar-
General of Melbourne. In 1917 he stepped
into the bishopric of Sandhurst, which up till
then had been a close preserve for the
Augustinian Fathers. The advent of a local
Apostolic Delegate has changed all that.
A picturesque addition to ecclesiastical
Sydney is the recently-arrived Greek arch-
bishop, Christoferos Ivnitis. A monk of
the Orthodox Order of St, Basil, he was
educated at Oxford. He wmved the crozier
of Serres in Macedonia for 20 years, but
never lost interest in things British, and
speaks English with an attractive accent.
As Archbishop and Metropolitan of Austral-
asia, he will have his headquarters in
Sydney; and what with building a cathedral,
erecting an episcopal palace and forming a
central Greek community club for Oyster-
opolis, he should have his hands full.
A. R. Callaghan, elected N.S.W. Rhodes
scholar for 1025, is a Bathurst lad who went
from the High School to Sydney Uni. in
1921. He has specialised in agriculture,
and will go up for his B.Sc. next month,
lie won his way into the ’Varsity XV as
a wing threequarter in 1923, playing against
the M.L. Universities, and later gaining met-
ropolitan rep. honors. With Wallace, Ray-
mond, Foote and Callaghan all up at Oxford
or going there, the ’Varsity threequarter line
can fairly claim to be a nursery for Rhodes
scholars.
Dr. Lindo Ferguson, the big eye special-
ist of Dunedin, contributed an item to a
congress of doctors at New York which
calls for thought. He said that reading
was the cause of modern eye troubles, and
that it was a habit of the last two centuries
only, though how this squares with all the
blind men in the Neto Testament it is hard
to say. “The eyes were not meant for read-
ing. but were intended for use in jungles
looking out for wild animals and searching
for food.” It seems hardly worth while for
man to be created if his mission through all
the centuries was to dodge big animals in
forests and catch small ones raw. Cats
would have served the purpose--cats with
souls or without them.
W. L. Davidson, dead after a long illness
in Adelaide, was a Scotchman who came to
Australia as a youth half a century ago,
went into partnership with E. N. Wigg, and
built up the large stationery and bookselling
business of Wigg and Son in Rundle-street.
Latterly he and his sons had been, the whole
firm, and four or five years back they dropped
the bookshop and circulating library to
specialise in wholesale business. Davidson
had many outside interest's, pastoral, mining
and artistic. A man of quick judgment, he
got in early and heavily to Broken Hill and
Ivalgoorlie. and was a consistent supporter
of artist Hans Heysen in his earliest days
before he went to Europe to study.
Randolph Bedford writes :
So good old Jim Gannon is dead—one of the best,
and a 100 per cent. Australian. There is a story
that illustrates his careless kindliness. In an early
stormy morning, after a late sitting of the N.S.W.
Legislative Council, the messenger went out to
Macquarie-street to find the then Attorney-General’s
transport back to Botany • Bay over the worst sub-
urban track in the world. Torrential rain fell, and
there was but one hansom, its saturated horse bend-
ing at. the knees as if about to sav its evening prayer.
At half-past 2 in the morning the cabby pulled up at
Doll’s Point. “Come inside and I’ll pay you, cabby,”
said Jim. “Mv oath, I will. A wet night, be
cripes!” In Gannon’s study t/he driver thawed
immediately, and the fire drew steam from his sod-
den clothes. With a big whjsky in his hand he
felt better. “What’s y’r fare?” “Thirty bob,
Hon’rable James Gannon.” “There’s two pounds ten.
Have another whisky?” “My oath, Hon’rable
James.” “Take a few cigars.” “I’ll just take one,
Hon’r’ble Gannon. First time I heard of you I
paid a fiver to’rds gettin’ you defend a friend o’
mine. Wasn’ a friend exactly—just a bloke I knoo
at Camperdown saleyards. Stole a ’orse.” Gannon
yawned and said. “Have a whisky.” “In a minnit.
I’ll jus’ go on with the yarn, Hon’ble Mister Gan-
non. So you defended him, an’ o’ course he was
out o’ danger, though there was three witnesses
that see him drivin’ the ’orse a week after it was
stole.” “Thanks. Have a couple of cigars before
you go.” “Ain’t gone j-et. He was out o’ danger,
but I wasn’t. Just’s luck ’d ’ave it I had to drive
a fare to the court while the trial was on. Me
drivin’ up to Darlin’hurst an’ wonderin’ if the bloke
that had the ’orse stole on ’im ’d be outside the
court when I got there. I was in a hell of a ’ole.”
“Why? What did it matter?” “Why, that was
my security for the fiver! I was drivin’ the ’orse
that was shook. But you got him off, Mist’ Gan-
non.” Gannon led him to the door. There the
cabman in the presence of a live democrat forgot
the Honorable. , “So long, Jim,” said he.

xMbert Sanford, founder and managing-direc-

Bishop Ivempthorne (Polynesia) was horn in Nelson
(M.L.) ; hut all the others are from overseas.
England supplies 24, Ireland 4 and S’Africa 1
(Gilbert White of Willochra). Bishops Cranswiek
(Gippsland) and Armstrong (Wangaratta) were
educated locally. Excluding grand old Bishop Lang-
ley, who now has no diocese, Archbishop Julius
(Christchurch), now 77, is the oldest. Thirty-nine years
below him is Bishop Ivempthorne, the baby, who
secured his bishopric in the record time of nine
years. Archbishop Riley (Perth) is 70, Archbishop
Wright (Svdne.y) 63, Archbishop Sharp (Brisbane)
69, and Archbishop Harrington Lees (Melbourne) 54.
Lancelot Stirling, 75 on November 5, lias
been President of S. Aus Legislative Council
for more than 23 years, and M.L.C. repre-
senting the same district continuously for
upwards of 33 years. Previously be was in
the Assembly, and has an aggregate Parlia-
mentary service exceeding 40 years.
Simpson Newland, author of “Paving the
Way,” was 89 last Sunday. Born at Hanley.
Staffordshire, in 1835, he was brought to
S. Aus. in 1839, when his dad, a Congrega-
tional minister, settled at Encounter Bay.
For many years Simpson was a pastoralist
on the Darling, and 40 years ago he was
Treasurer of the province. He is still vigor-
ous and hearty, and goes to his office daily.
F. S. Mance steps into B. H. Camhage’s
shoes as Under-Sec. of N.S.W. Mines De-
partment. Tarramatta is Mance’s birth
place, and Sydney High School put the final
touch to bis education. He has been most
things in the department, from editor of
“Mineral Statistics” to chief clerk and war-
den for the State.
Albert Macdonald, Overland telegraphist,
who died the other day in Adelaide, was a
valued member of the old Darwin com-
munity of pre-Commonwealth days. Twenty-
six years ago, when motor-cars were practi-
cally unknown, he crossed the continent on
an ordinary push bike. The first man to do
it was Jerome Murif, an adventurous engi-
neer from Broken Hill, who was so -poor a
showman that nobody knew he was attempt-
ing- it; Macdonald followed him at a dis-
tance of about four years.
John Dunstan, who has died at Broken
Hill while on a visit, was formerly Mayor
of that town. Before that he was one of
Sawthstralia’s big Cornish colony in the
Burra district. As a member of the firm of
Sara and Dunstan he built everywhere, and
built everything, from lighthouses to gaols,
retiring finally to Chatswood (N.S.W.).
whence he proceeded occasionally to Willunga
(S.A.) to give an eye to the slate quarries
which have been spasmodically worked there
by Dunstans and Saras for 70 years or so.
THE AIRPLANE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The earth goes by below me, the earth that my wide
wings spurn;
To the sunlit heights beyend the clouds —the top-
most clouds—l yearn.
Though heavy the fog-banks hover, and the cold rain
slants between,
Undimmed are the upper spaces and ever the air is
clean.
No taint of the soil, no fetor of town or of brackish
foam
May cling to my swift propeller or follow me where
I roam;
And up from the murky fog-banks and up from the
clammy clods
I soar to the central heavens, a singing child of the
gods!
Ikedalus lived too early and dreamed his dreams too
soon!
Mine are the wings would bear him to the gold-
rimmed horns of the moon.
No thunder-shock may fright me, nor sun’s heat lay
me low ;
1 climb the path of the starbeams, I go where the
comets go 1
1 veer like a wind-blown blossom, I soar as the
eagles soar,
1 swoop in the falcon’s fashion, I have learned the
falcon’s lore.
Like a leaf that the wind has lifted, or a fleck of
wave-whirled foam,
1 drift, as .your dreams have drifted—the heights
of the sky my home!
There is never a hill may bar me : there is never a
sea may bind.
Though their hands reach forth to hold me, 1
leave them lost behind.
The shifting sands of the desert the feet of a man
mac 7 snare,
But my wings beat high above them as I climb
to the upper air,
Treeless and trackless, boundless, the paths that I
follow far,
Moonlit or sunlit, soundless as the world’s waste
places are.
And up from the steamy marshes, and up from the
sands and sods,
i soar to the central heavens—a singing child of
the gods !
QUEENSLAND.

ABORIGINAUTIES

BARNES-LINSEED OIL
“ J.G.” : Rc queries as to good daily walk-
ing average. I have before me a map of the country
between the Goulburn River and Corio Bay (Vic.)
over which Hume and Hovell travelled now close on
100 years ago. The party discovered the Goulburn
near Molesworth on December 3, 1824, and next
day were about 10 miles away, having travelled
through terribly rough country with a small mob of
bullocks. These earliest of Victoria’s explorers
travelled from 10 to 20 miles per day to Corio Bay
and back, through rough hills and dense forests.
Though Hume and Hovell had horses, the rest of
the party—some half-dozen men —were on foot. For
long-sustained travel through an unknown and track-
less country, this journey will take some beating.
“Boronia”: Recently, while a friend of
mine was out duck-shooting, he picked up a cartridge
which, appearing to be perfectly sound, was placed
in the gun in readiness for the next shot. When
this transpired, about a dozen pieces of the breech
suddenly decided to take divorce proceedings, with
the result that he had to spend a fortnight in hospi-
tal. The local wiseacres, while admitting that the
gun was a good one and that my friend was too
knowing a sport to have collected any obstruction in
the barrel, came to the conclusion that the shell
of the cartridge must have been somewhat perished,
thus permitting undue force to be thrown on the
breech of the gun. What is the opinion of the
gun experts in the Council ?
* * * *
“Trevdee”: Near Warracknabeal (Vic.)
recently two turkeys came upon a snake. The birds
stood wing to wing while they launched a combined
beak attack on the reptile, which struck back time
and again. After the battle there were two turkeys
and one snake lying on the grass—all dead! Can
any Councillor relate a more grand-operatic ending
to any battle?
* * * *
“The Jumper” : That fencing record —cart-
ing, sinking the holes, erecting and boring 105 6in.
posts (six holes) in a day—cited by “Daverich” (B.
25/9/’24), will certainly take some beating. Many
energetic bushworkers that I know would consider
they had done a fair thing if they bored 100 six-inch
posts (six holes each) in a day, and they wouldn’t be
far out either. That cocky chap who claims to have
put up the record might have included the splitting
of the posts in the day’s work —it would have sounded
more complete and been just as readily believed. But
I suspect, though, that “Dave” is only trying to
give the Council a “pull,” or may be his friend
stretched his leg a bit for him. Anyway, the Devil
himself, with four imps to help him, couldn’t accom-
plish the job in the time stated.
* * * *
“L. 8.”: Can anyone beat this for a
record? A cow owned by an Indian at Gulargambone
(N.S.W.) has just given birth to three heifer calves,
making the lady’s total 19. She is 18 years old,
and from 2 years old has calved every year, topping
up this year with three. She is an excellent milker
and is in the best of condition.
* * * *
“Lily-Beale”: As the best bush compass
and chronometer let me nominate the nardoo plant,
which grows pretty well all over Australia. At
dawn the leaves are lying flat on the ground, facing
the east, and as the day progresses they gradually
rise. At midday 1 they are perpendicular, and during
the afternoon they slowly sink. At sundown the
plant is lying on the ground facing the west. Most
bushmen know about this, and it not only tells
them the time, but is always a faithful guide to
direction.
* * * *
“Yardley”: There is a railway station
almost opposite my door. The dog habitually repairs
to the verandah to welcome my son on his return
from work. Others of the household are liable to
hurry to the door at the approach of a down train,
but the dog never makes such a mistake.
"BILL ONE, WELL DONE.”
WAITER: “Was the dinner cooked to suit you, sir?”
DINER : “Yes, but you might take the bill back and have it boiled
down a little.”
“A.E.P.”: I never heard Papuan coastal
skippers called “dog barkers.” The phrase is an
American one; Peter Kyne alludes to the use of
recognisable dog barks as an aid to navigation on
the Pacific coast of the United States. In the course
of years of weary voyages along the shores of Papua,
the only term of contempt I learned was “mangrove
pilot.”
•* * * »
“Moe”: One sometimes comes across an
albino native in New Guinea, and another variety
of white nigger is occasionally encountered, especially
in the districts which border on the mountain ranges.
This latter kind is of a dull, greyish-white tint, either
all over or else in patches; and although in some
the skin where the patches are is scaly, more often
it is quite smooth and normal. When there are
small patches, only a few inches across, they are
frequently without feeling. The phenomenon seems
to be due to abnormal conditions in the pigmentation
cells of the skin, and, as practically all the cases of
it that have been reported have been located in
mountainous country, it may be in some unknown
way connected with thyroid-gland deficiency, as
in goitre. So far, however, there have not been
enough of the cases to permit of any research being
carried out in this direction.
* » * *
“Wewak” : One of the queerest shark-
catching outfits in the world is used by natives of
New Ireland. The trap is so fixed that the shark,
in order to get at a fish, puts his head into a
noose, which tightens on his neck. There is a
float, shaped very much like the propeller of an
aeroplane, and the shark tires himself out dragging
HORRIBLE CASE OF INSOMNIA.
“’Aren’t slept for days.”
“Wotsa matter? Feelin’ crook?”
“No. I sleep at night.”
this about. A rattle fixed to the float lets the world
know that there is something doing, and when the
shark is worn out the fisherman comes up in a
dugout with a club. Sharks up to 14ft. long are
caught in this way, though usually they run to about
half that size.
“Lily-Beale”: A collie pup owned by Mr.
Stone, of Walgett (N.S.W.), recently broke all records
of canine sagacity. Being born in the drought, it
had had no experience in the water. While travelling
with its master after recent heavy rains it manag 1
to scramble across a small creek, but coming to the
Namoi River and ■ doubting its own powers of en-
durance, it waited until the horse, ridden by Mr.
Stone, had entered the stream; then it held on to
the nag’s tail like grim death till it was safely landed
on the other side.
* •* * *
“Darrapinta”: “Ragar’s” praise (B.
9/10/’24) for the ropes formerly made by the Papuans
and other Paeans
Islanders is echoed V
a shark-line in my pos-
session which comes
from Raratonga. It is
over 100 yards long
with a fin. diameter,
and has been built oi
cocoanut-fibre yam. in
the familiar eight-
strand whiplash plait.
The “hook” is a stout
piece of banyan root,
pointed at each end; :.o
the middle of it the
line is tied, and a heavy
chafing of split cane
for 6ft. above the hook
prevents the line from
being bitten through.
The hook, though
crude, was effective. It
was turned to lie along
the line, and the bait,
usually a large rock
cod, tied around it.
The shark was allowed
to swallow the bait
completely, and then a
sharp jerk caused the
wooden bar to twist at
right angles to the line,
its sharp points teai-
ing into the flesh
around the fish’s
stomach, holding it se-
curely. Tests with a
short piece of this rope
have shown it to be
equal in strength to
Manila cord of the same size.
* * * *
“Talord”: Now that Mr. Snake is peep-
ing over the parapet again, attention, liars all! A
cocky at Maitland, Yorke’s Peninsula (S.A.), lws
bottled a four-footer ugly enough to make even this
hardened page gasp. It has a shuddery blue scaly
back, a yellow belly, two little lizard feet six inches
from the head, a distinct neck, with a blood-red
throat, two large fangs, a yellow tongue and a tiny
pink comb running the full length of the head.
The rest is pure snake. Now!
* • * * *
“Gouger”: To the Cape York Peninsula
niggers every nightbird is a spirit of the dead and
is dreaded as being gifted with all manner of super-
natural powers. The mere swish of a nightbird’s
wings overhead makes the very dogs crouch
low in the gunyahs. But when the niggers meet the
same bird in the light of day it is a very differ-lit
matter ; the fowl goes on the roasting stones immedi-
ately if not sooner. It is the same with the flying-
fox. He is the Devil’s own devil by night, but by
day the niggers nullah-nullah him with cheerfulness
and efficiency.
* * * *
“Nitric”: “U.8.D.” asks wliat animal
killed the wallaby and ate a circular hole out of the
side of the chest. A wild cat. I shot one once- in
ti»e act of butchering a ’possum; the latter’s chest
was eaten away .and it was ripped completely along
its stomach. The reason for the latter procedure
I don’t know, for the wild cat will not eat the
viscera. Re “U.B.D.’s” query concerning the yearling
poddy with a hole eaten out of its back, he can
bet a turkey to a tomtit that an eaglehawk was
responsible. They always go for lambs in the
region of the kidneys, and I have seen a couple
of small calves with eyes pecked out and flesh
eaten in the lumbar region.
“J.G.”: Tell “U.8.D.” that the culprit that ate
a hole out of his poddy’s back (B. 9/10/’24) was
a domestic cat gene bush, most likely one that had
been wild from birth. I have seen scores of rabbits,
and an occasional hare, that had been killed and dealt
with in the same way as the wallaby described by
“U.8.D.” It is quite possible that one of these
cats also dealt with the poddy, most likely fastening
upon the calf’s back whilst the latter was lying down.
Some of these cats grow to a huge size and are
very strong, and as savage as tigers. As a rule,
when they get a rabbit they start and eat into ifs
chest; keeping on they literally eat the animal
out of its skin, which they leave intact and un-
damaged except for the hole near the chest. One
of the maddest things that you can get into a trap is
a wild domestic cat; the cnly way then is to “out”
the intruder with a long sapling. Though I have
seen lots of cats that have gone wild and taken to
the bush, I have never yet seen any evidence of
toms and tabbies having mated in the bush. If
they did, wild cats would be as numerous as rabbits
in some districts.

WELCOME WATER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a place called Welcome Water
That the white men seldom see ;
Though ’tis but a rockhole waiting
In the dry heat unabating,
Oft I think I’d like to be,
Spite of wife or son or daughter,
On my way to Welcome Water,
Welcome Water,
South and east of Kimberley 1
Years ago the worn explorers
With their stumbling camels came,
On this precious pothole chancing
As a fiery sun was glancing
To its nightly bed of flame,
Spinifex and sand around it.
“Welcome Water”—
On the map at last, a name.
Southward runs the slow Oakover,
North the Fitzroy seaward flows;
But between them, ever drifting,
Lie the central sandhills shifting;
Burn the sandhills, rows on rows;
East or westward blowing, blowing,
Thither coming, whither going,
No man sees and no man knows.
Southward gleam the Throssell Ranges,
Northward shine the Leopold;
But between them, tortured, turning
Redly to the hot winds burning,
Run these ridges, fold on fold ;
Desert yet, but one far-dreaming
Haw them in the future gleaming
Fields of fortune, paths of gold t
BOTH DO IT.
“I suppose you and your wife have a dip
every morning?”
“Oh, yes—I dip in the surf and she dips in
the trousers.”
To this silent, still oasis
In that lonely hinterland,
In a dry November broiling,
Through these thirsty regions toiling,
Came our tired Australian band—
Dauntless sons and daring brothers,
Marking footpaths for the others
Out across an unknown land.
So they called it “Welcome Water.”
Ah, the camels dying slow,
And our brave hearts stoutly thinking
Thoughts that keep the soul from sinking,
When the thin blood in its flow
Begs a tcnic of the Spirit,
Shows a man of mud —or merit;
Learns the man himself to know!
Ne’er before had white men, learning
Bitter lessons in that school,
Come across these ridges lonely.
Savage eyes had seen it only,
This unmarked life-giving pool ;
Nomads in the sands begotten,
Naked forms, uncouth, forgotten,
Creeping towards its waters cool.
These, with stone-head spear and firestick,
Crouched around it in the night—
Tn the night of far-gone ages,
When bold heroes and wise sages
Did on glowing pages write
Their achievements and their glories,
Wondrous deeds, undying stories,
Bright with daring and delight.
Far away, by Welcome Water,
Primal tongues in primal rhyme
Told their tales of chase and slaughter,
Love and war, hy Welcome Water ;
Sang in quaint barbaric tune
Songs mayhap that weird, coeval
Monsters heard in nights primeval,
Crawling shoreward from the slime.
When they chanced on Welcome Water
Nearly thirty years gone by—
Some to win new ways of wending,
Two ’neath cloudless skies unending
In the desert sands to lie—
All the world its path was speeding,
Selfish, careless and unheeding,
Hourly needs to satisfy.
When they came to Welcome Water —
Just at sundown, so I deem—
Lights of distant towns were showing;
City dwellers safely flowing
Homeward in a noisy stream.
But the fall of night’s dark curtain
Left them there with hopes uncertain,
Left them there to’ doze and dream.
There in fitful rest abiding,
Groups our first Australian band!
Onward for the Fitzroy flowing,
With the fiery morn outgoing,
To that far-appointed land,
Some to win their homeward places,
Two to turn distorted faces,
Dying, downward, in the sand!
Welcome Water! Welcome Water
In the silent wide Nor’-West!
See these lone explorers dreary
Turn again their slow steps weary
Forward to a land more blest;
Finding each, despite his burden,
Inward faith or fancied guerdon,
Somewhere yet, reward and rest.
So we toil to some oasis
As the dusty shadows fall,
On our long life journey wending
With the sunset skies o’er-bending,
So we answer to the ca 11....
Sons of sons and daughters’ daughters,
May we win to Welcome Waters,
Welcome Waters,
Welcome Waters, after all!
VICTORIA.

“Marko” : Re “Capta” and the scarcity of
mangrove sticks for oyster culture (B. 16/10/’24).
Bamboo has been very successfully experimented with
in N. S. Wales. The Fisheries Department did it in
Middle Harbor, but it is probable that quarried
stones are now used just as extensively as mangrove.
A trip to George’s River would be a revelation to
••Capta.” Re the French tile method, a lime-wash
coating is first given and then a dip in hydraulic
cement; whitewash alone would be quite useless.
“Capta” infers that, black mangrove can be re-used.
This is out of the question, because all the bark
comes off with the first crop, and without bark the
sticks are useless. Suitable stones cost about £6 a
thousand to quarry and lay out, but upkeep and
replacement accounts are nil. Mangrove, if pro-
curable, costs less, but a new set of stakes is requiied
every three years or so.
* * * *
“Pawpaw”: At Tliornleigh, Blackall
(C.Q.), a shearer wagered £8 that eight strong
men with 22 yards of rope would hold the best
draught-horse on the station. The challenge was
accepted by Clancy, a well-known local teamster, and
the pull took place after some heavy rain. Not-
withstanding the greasy nature of the foothold the
eight men were able to hold the horse and finally
to pull him back.
• * * *
“Larrapinta”: The eagles around Glen
Annie, in the Macdonnell Ranges (Centralia), have a
method of hunting which I have never seen anywhere
else. I was there in ’B7, and the rock wallabies
were very plentiful. The eagles were always in
pairs, the hen flying low over the bushes, the cock
hovering high in the air at the rear. As soon as
the hen flushed a wallaby, the cock, after giving a
shrill whistle of warning, would nose-dive straight at
the quarry, seize it, and flap heavily off to the nearest
tree, where the pair would devour it. 1 was in
that locality for 18 months, and this method was
always used.
* * * *
“Jumbuk”: Noticing “Jimmy Possum’s”
doubts whether wedgetails dine on crow (B. 9/10/’24)
I send details of a recent experience of mine. Late
in August, whilst gathering up sheep in a scrub
paddock near Condamine (Q.), my attention was
attracted by a great disturbance amongst some crows.
Investigations showed three wedgetails at a mast -
one on dead sheep, the second on lamb, the third on
a newly-killed crow. The feathers of the crow had
a beautiful sheen, which they would not have had
had the bird been sick. The eagles appeared to have
driven the crows off the feast and, during the
scuffle, killed one of them. Contrary to all previous
experiences of mine, when the birds
were disturbed, instead of the crows
chasing the wedgetails, it was the
eagles that were the pursuers.
OUT OF BOUNDS.
ONE : “Yes, young Smithers was the goal of
my daughter's affections.”
T’OTHER: “And are they to he married?”
ONE : “No; I kicked the goal.”
“FY7”: How’s this for the Queer Accident
competition? At Brisbane a few days ago a car,
driven by a shire councillor named Grimes, with
one passenger, struck a rough piece of road and
turned a complete forward somersault. It landed
on its wheels again and proceeded on its journey,
the flabbergasted inmates finding themselves still in
their seats and, like the car, unharmed. The hood
was up, and this it was that caught them and
dropped the pair back without doing much more
than denting their hats. The odds against such
a thing coming off a second time are as great as
those against the councillor forgetting to see that
the road is repaired instanter.
* * * *
“Bouragi” : Though, as “Morob” says (B.
16/10/’24), the crocodile is not always found close
to water, he can be fairly certain that the father of
fancy kitbags doesn't go dry save from dire necessity
or pressing business. In North Queensland, where
lagoons and other non-tidal waters often dry in
summer, crocodiles are sometimes caught on the
trek. Kipling makes the old mugger in one of his
yarns tell of a long land journey, and in Mayne
Reid’s long-forgotten “Rifle Ranges” the villain lures
a cayman across country to the herowhine’s private
swimming-bath by the simple expedient of walking
in front of the lizard, and twisting a pup’s tail to
make him yelp. “Morob” should hold a post-mortem
on his next croc, and then repent of his statement
that “there is nothing about the anatomical structure
of the croc, which suggests that Nature intended it
to live close to or actually in water.” All the
crocodiles and alligators are fitted with a special
system of breathing passages which enable them to
open and shut their mouths under water without
choking. Otherwise, as air-breathers, they could not
indulge in their favorite custom of dining under
water, or drag down big prey to the bottom. The
air passages run from the nostrils at the tip of the
snout to the extreme base of the skull, and all
communication with the mouth is cut off by special
development of the palate bones. The throat, too, is
fitted with special valves to prevent water gaining
ingress while the croc, is busy under water with his
mouth full.
* * * *
“Dry” : Tell “Phoney” (B. 18/9/’24) that,
having been a tourist (per boot) for some thousands
of miles, I can give an opinion that is backed by
scores of travellers on the question, “W hat is the
best gait for a long tramp ?” It is always considered
that 12 miles a day is a good average with a fair
swag. My best (or worst) day’s walk was 49 miles,
in a blistering January, without boots (my fancy
cloth-tops would not stand the strain). There was
not a house or waterhole on that 49 miles; hence
the long walk. It ate a bit of the night, though.
After doing over 1500 miles, with a 601 b. swag, which
included a pick, shovel and gold dish, I am quite
satisfied 12 miles a day is good going. My swag-
got darn’d heavy at the end of that tour.

“Dingo”: The growth in the eye of
“F.J.N.’s” horse (B. 23/10,/’24) may be either a
benign or a malignant tumor, but almost certainly
the latter. The “small pinky piece of flesh” lie
refers to is the membrana nictitans, or third eyelid,
which serves to remove foreign bodies from the eye.
It is a common starting-point for both sorts of
tumors. In either case the only treatment worth
considering is cold steel in the hands of a capable
veterinary surgeon. The use of arsenic would be
hellishly cruel and absolutely useless.
* * * *
“Nitric”: Marvellous are the vagaries of
the whirlwind! At Murwillumbah (Northern N.S.W.)
the other day, I saw a bicycle which had been
left on a footpath lifted certainly a hundred feet
into the air. A rubbish-tip sailed up to meet it,
and for some time there was a brisk shower of
boots, tins and other debris.
* * * *
“-Timmy Possum”: “Lou’s” par about the
“S” gates used by some squatters in West Queens-
land (B. 25/9/’24) reminds me of the “8.8.8. ’
gates favored by eockies on the Bananaland coast.
These barways consist of three, four
or more strands of stout barbed
wire stretched between two strong
uprights, about sft. long, one of
which is permanently fixed to a gate-
post. To close the gate, the foot of
the free upright is inserted in a
ring of strong wire at the bottom of
the other gate-post, and then pulled
taut by a twitch-stick, which is
attached to the top of the upright
and operated round the post, which
acts as a fulcrum. When the wires
are taut the twitch-stick is fastened
by a wire catch. When heavy wire
is used and properly strained up,
these gates are ordinarily bull-proof,
but they are blinkin’ blanks to open
and shut, the wicked wires delight-
ing in getting foul of some part of one’s anatomy.

“ Jcobb”: Professor Archibald Watson, of
Adelaide, who has been spending the last few mondi.s
in the Northern Territory, had an exciting time
amongst the alligators on a recent sea trip to the
Daly River settlement. Several had been shot on
the trip up the river, and on the return, while
waiting for the tide to change, a huge ’gator was
sighted about 500 yards away. “Shoot him! Shoot
him!” excitedly shouted the old Professor. Skipper
Louie Roman, one of the best shots of the North,
fired and got the saurian through the brain at the
first attempt. Natives along the bank assisted 1o
put the reptile on board. It was 12ft. long and
about the same girth. A few slashes of the axe and
a stroke or so of the saw and the lady lay dis-
membered on the deck. Here is an inventory of
the contents: One kangaroo, about 401 b. of fish
(including two 12lb. barramundi), a barrow-load of
stones and shingle, two large pieces of much-worn
glass (probably the heels of soda-water bottles from
coastal vessels), and a 9ft. rock python still alive.
The snake was evidently the last morsel the lady had
partaken of; probably the python just swam into
the jaws lying conveniently open on the surface of
the river. The Professor has the heart, which con-
tained some blood worms —very interesting, he says.

“C.G.”: Several weeks ago I lent a stag-
hound to a hunter on the north-west coast of Tas-
mania, who took him 30 miles back in the bush to
hunt ’roos. They had been gone about a week when
Staggy returned home with a piece of paper tied to
his neck. It was a note from his new master, stating
that he had met with an accident and broken his leg.
I went to the place with a doctor and conveyed him
to the nearest hospital.
* * * *
“T.V.T.” : If the Queer Accident stake is
still open, I enter the case of a Gippsland settler in
the hills near Boolara. He attempted to roll a
big log while he was wearing a grass-seed sowing-
bag over his shoulders. A short spike of the log,
as it rolled, caught the strap of his bag, and the
settler went with the log to the bottom of the hill,
where his crushed remains were found a day or two
later.
“Gouger”: To the uninitiated, an awkward
vegetable to cook is the Dam-boon nut, a favorite
dish of the N.Q. scrub niggers. Bang the shells
hard, and out roll the nuts, about the size of apples.
Don’t eat them yet, because they are full of poison.
Place in a basin-shaped oven of hot stones a thick
layer of green fern fronds. In this bed lay the
nuts, with another thick layer of ferns on top.
Heap the lot over with sand. Build a strong fire
over all, and steam the nuts all night. They’re
bonzer for breakfast. The Coo-hoy nut is also good
eating, and it merely wants a brown roasting to be
fit for a hungry man’s meal. But the Too-moo is
THE NEW-STYLE BOWYANG.
THE GANGER : “Here, you-you're not doing enough to
soil your pretty hands! Blime, you'll he coinin’
to work with jazz garters next!"
tricky, unless you want a quick but painful passage
through the pearly gates. It looks like a black
plum, and grows in N.Q. tropical scrubs. Place a
heap of the fruit in a hollow rock filled with water.
Tramp on them until the shells float away. Crush
the fruit into meal between two stones. Place the
meal between two banana leaves and toast on the
coals just like johnny-cakes, after having first
soaked it in running water so that the poison will
be carried away. Learn a few more tricks like these,
and you will never starve in N.Q.’s tropical scrubs
when the enemy comes.
* * * *
“ J.L.1.”: High up on the head-waters of
the Johnstone (N.Q.) is a precipitous walled creek
which hides the council chamber of a jungle tribe.
This gloomy cavern isi about 20ft. high, 30ft. wide,
and 200 ft. long. The tw ; o blackboys with me, full of
superstitious fear, assured me that there was a hole
in the floor which went down “forever” until it
emptied into the land of the spirits. I could hear
no sound of subterranean waters running beneath,
nor find any hole, but it is quite possible that the
tribe’s “doctor” has a secret hole leading into a
deeper chamber from which he scares the very devil
out of the credulous councillors above. The roof of
rock is painted with designs mostly resembling frogs
of different colors. The niggers must have rigged
a framework to paint so on the roof, although no
sign of any staging is visible. In this isolated hole
in the earth one tribe after another has doubtless
held its councils and performed the secret rites of
initiation into warriorhood since the dawn.
* * * *
“Borom”: A delicacy amongst the Chinese
in Northern Australia is a dish made partly from
octopus. The smaller beasts are used; the bigger
ones are inclined to be rank in taste and very tough.
The meat is removed in strips, chopped into tiny
squares and cooked with herbs, chicken and other
odds and ends. It is served in small dishes liber-
ally covered with one of the pungent black sauces of
which the Chinese are so fond. The meat is quite
white, somewhat resembling pork, for which it is
often mistaken. Actually there is no reason why
octopus should not be eaten, for although it is
carnivorous it is just as much a feeder on vegetable
matter, and is not a scavenger like the pig, pre-
ferring to catch its animal food alive.
* * * *
“Nitric” : A cod weighing 1501 b. was lately
taken from the Boobora Lagoon, off the Mclntyre
River (Q.). Many fish up to 90lb. have been caught
in the latter, and I have seen one of 1201 b. caught
in Western Queensland. But this catch of 1501 b.
must be a record. Based on city prices for cod,
the sprat would be worth £ll ss. Any better haul?
* * * *
“Homfrey Beale” : Some time ago we found
a couple of curlew’s eggs, and placed them with a
dozen hen eggs under a broody' chook. At first the
old lady resented the strange fruit, and showed her
disapproval by several times rolling them away from
the nest with her bill, but eventually was prevailed
upon to accept custody. The young curlews came
into the world on the same day as the chickens, and
from the first the hen gave them far more attention
than the other members of her family. Later she
developed an extreme antipathy to thq chickens, and
they now have to be fed apart, owing to the old
girl’s active hostility. Curlews’ eggs, by the way,
vary in color according to the nature of the country
in which they are found. I have seen them in
swamps with markings and background of a pale
green, and in dry parts with ditto of various shades
of red and brown —the best case of protective coloring
I know of.
"X2.v”: Apropos the method of stopping
haemorrhage from a severed femoral artery, by com-
pressing the vessel on to the pelvic bone, “Six and
Eight” (B. 16/XO/’24) might have added that in
cases in which such pressure has to be applied for
lengthy periods before proper medical treatment can
be obtained, it is essential that it should be removed
for a few seconds at intervals of about half an hour,
otherwise unpleasant and difficult complications are
likely.
•r * * *
“Joe”: I was returning from Morobe to
Rabaul, along the north coast of New Guinea, per
schooner, with 27 niggers on board.
When about eight miles from
Witu, the boy on lookout shouted
something to the boy at the helm.
Noticing the schooner swing over
to starboard, 1 inquired the reason
of the boss boy, and was informed
(in . pidgin, of course) that two
turtles were mating, and would be
easy to catch. When within about
20 yards of them all the boys
except five dived overboard. One
turtle was easily secured, it being
on its back; the boys simply
brought it up to the surface of
the sea, and hanging on to the
edge of the shell started a sing-
sing in the water. The other one
managed to struggle free and
dived, three boys going down with
it, struggling to turn it on its
back. I thought I would have to
enter “two natives drowned” in
the log, as it was fully three
minutes before they came up, with-
out the turtle; but. they must have
gone down some depth, as they
were all bleeding at the nostrils
and ears. The captured turtle
was hauled on deck, and the exe-
cutioner carried on. The meat
being a delicacy, there was a
great sing-sing when we anchored
for the night at davit plantation.
I claimed the shell only as my share; it is beauti-
fully colored and prettily marked, and sft. 4in. in
height.
*,* * *
“Strack” : When I read “Larrapinta’s” and
“Mimax’s” recipes for removing obstructions from
rifle-barrels, by filling with water and firing a reduced
charge, I was not impressed. It seemed to me that
they had overlooked the fact that in most cases it is
the leading of the barrel which causes the blockage,
and it is not much good removing the bullet without
removing the cause of the trouble. Also, the risk of
bursting the barrel, as “Mimax” pointed out, is not
negligible. A few days ago my old .22 automatic
rifle went out of action with this very complaint, and
I decided to try to remove the bullet and also the
cause of the stoppage. I made a ramp of hot coals
sloped off at about 30 degrees, and placed the barrel
on it and heaped more coals on top. In a few
minutes the molten lead ran out. Then I brushed the
OUR DISAPPEARING FAUNA.

downer ahead. They’re rare birds since
the motor-cars came.”
THE MOTORIST: “By Jove! I’d better dodge
him, then. They might be protected.”
barrel with a wire brush and left it in the coals for
about 20 minutes. After that I removed it, brushed
out the oxides of lead which remained in the barrel
in powder form, and tempered it with ordinary
machinery oil, thus restoring its hardness and blue-
ness. Result: No further trouble of any sort, and a
clean, bright barrel.
* * * *
“Cwrw Bacli” : There is still a bit of good
timber left. At Killarney (Q.) the other day they
felled a pine-tree and cut' up 88 feet of the trunk
into six logs, totalling 10,506 feet, every inch of it
marketable. One or two other saplings came down
to make up a good load. One was 112 ft. high.

Ihe NewESSEX
A SIX Built by Hudson Under Hudson Patents
The new Essex—a “Six” is built by Hudson under Hudson
patents. Thus, it is the product of famous six-cylinder ex-
perience, by the sixth largest builder of cars in the world.
It is a mature car from the outset.
All that Hudson and Essex cars have achieved in the past
speaks with equal force for the new Essex. It inherits the
reputation for performance, reliability and economy,
which Hudson and Essex cars have earned in the service of
their many users in this territory, as in all parts of the world.
Advantages of Both Hudson
And the Former Essex
For the same principles that made the
famous Hudson and Essex records, in offi-
cial tests, as well as owner service, are in-
corporated in the New Essex.
And with these added advantages it costs
less than Essex quality ever sold for.
The new Essex gives greater economy of fuel,
tires, and oil than ever. Little attention
is needed to keep it in first class condition.
Maintenance is simple and inexpensive.
The low price of replacement parts will
astonish you.
It has a smoothness and ease of perform-
ance that will prove a revelation even to
those accustomed to much costlier cars.
The center of gravity is low and with a
unique spring arrangement gives comfort
and roadability heretofore exclusive to
high-priced cars. Steering is easy. Con-
trols answer to a touch. It has the same
type clutch, transmission and axles that
Hudson has so convincingly proved in
years of satisfactory service.
In either the Coach, with closed car comforts
or the open touring model, we believe you will
agree the new Essex provides ideal trans-
portation. The price takes it out of all com-
petition with cars of comparable quality.

Good Cutlery that is Inexpensive
/ r "" > UTLERY is a household necessity. In constant use,
it must be of superior manufacture to withstand the
hard wear to which it is subjected. When choosing
cutlery it is wise to insist on that of guaranteed Sheffield

should also be well proportioned and balanced.
In these days when domestic help is so scarce,
stainless cutlery is an undoubted boon to the busy house-
wife, because it eliminates the unpleasant task of knife-
polishing.

FOR THE TERM OF YOUR
NATURAL LIFE!
/ V \\NOO>Ofc, h.
There are tens of thousands in our midst who are undergoing a severe Life Sentence.
No offence is charged against them, yet they are required to pay a toll which varies according to their
place of residence. The liability is not fixed; it constantly grows greater.
If they were our wealthiest citizens, the hardship would be small. But it is not the richest section of the
community which labors under this enormous burden.
This grievous exaction is the toll which the majority of men pay for the privilege of living in other men’s houses.
A reduction in wages by five shillings a week would mean a
violent protest, with hints of sabotage and revolution.
Yet here is a monstrous levy—far greater than any '‘sweating”
practised by the most callous employer on his most helpless
employee.
Why, the rent-increase during one year often means a substantial
lowering of the standard of living.
Perhaps yon yourself are a rent-payer. If so, you know what
it means.
Is there any prospect of your rent being reduced?
Nc, it is only a dream —a dream which w 7 ill never come true,
for the principal cause of high rents is the constant rise in land
values —an inevitable feature of every developing city.
Sydney is erecting one thousand new buildings every month, Melbourne nearly as many, Brisbane and Adelaide
in proportion. The heavy demand makes land more valuable.
There is no possibility of the cessation of this activity. Even
London and New York, big as they are, grow’ bigger every day.
Therefore, rents must continue to rise.
In the penitentiary, long-term criminals secure certain privileges
or concessions through good conduct.
But the rent-payer's burden is doomed to become heavier and
heavier.
IS THERE NO ESCAPE?
There is. The way is open to those who have the courage and
the foresight to take it.
Fifty thousand people throughout Australia are taking the
T. M. BURKE way to their reprieve.
We provide Suburban Allotments on a Small Deposit, and
Instalments of £1 per month upwards. Here is an easy way
of setting: your own home, and freeing yourself from the land-
lord’s grip.
It takes a little time. It needs a little self-denial. But it solves one of Life's Biggest Problems—it saves you from paying rent
on an ever-rising scale For the Term of Your Natural Life.

Phones Cantrel 1532, 1533,
A biting wind and the new official stand
combined to turn Flemington into an orchard
of Dead Sea fruit as far as the peeping
Eve was concerned on Saturday. Nor were
the books much more cheerful; their new
possie and the monotony of favorites dash-
ing to the front at the wrong end of the
race made quite a number of them turn
their thoughts to dairy farming. “At least,”
as one prominent nose affirmed, “you do
know when a cow is ready to be milked!”
The dress pageant of former generations
is no more. Even within the near-royal
enclosure clothes were weatherproof rather
than brilliant. Black and black-and-white,
or black served with cochineal red, was the
prevailing raiment. Beige was second favorite ;
but hats flew soft plumes, and the furs were
delirious. One black musquash had a “bird ’
lining—parrots and futuristic-looking winged
creatures in reds and yellows with black
beaks, flying against a background of skyey
blue. The vice regal pen put up the “Full
House” sign. It harbored the G.-G. For-
sters, N.S.W. Governor de Chair and his
pleasant lady and Governor Tom Bridges, of
South Aus'. The Stradbrokes smiled silkily
when Night Patrol, from the home pasture,
won them the Cantala Stakes. Lady
Stradbroke was tailored in the shade
of red browns that is known as
tortoise-shell; the long coat was col-
lared to the ear-lobes in skunk. Lady
Forster wore the duckiest hat of the
day. It was small and black, and around
its crown of black lace it had a border of
forget-me-nots. Her black frock was
weighted with blue embroideries, and her
coat was a mixture of black satin and
grey Persian lamb. Lady de Chair turned
on a gorgeous violet georgette embossed
in peacock tones; Miss Carleton (S.A.) wore
clothes like a quiet whisper, and Lady
Helena Rous had the übiquitous ermine. A
good-looker of the day was Harry Clxauvel’s
lady (her boys were with the Stradbroke
lads) ; and one-time Sydneysiders Mrs. Harry
Whiting and Mrs. Allan Spowers were
worthy a second glance. Irene Vanbrugh
came defying the fates with a touch of
green ; Mrs. Colin Stephen, from Sydney,
brought daughter Helen. Another Sydney
visitor was artist Minns’s wife. Harry
Gullett’s wife gave her smooth black hair
and magnolia skin an outing. The Byron
Moore clan were in full song, and the
Lauchlan Mackinnons managed to look as
though they were praising God and helping
the starving books at the same time.
After 12 years on the unattached list the
Naval and Military Club Ball was again
called up for active service last Friday
night in St. Kilda Town Hall. But it was
only the pale shadow of its pre-war self.
When the Heavy Brigade, consisting of the
G.-G. and Lady Forster, Governor de Chair
and his lady, Governor Tom Bridges and
Miss Carleton came into action, few people
realised their presence ; and the cutting out
of the official square did not mend matters.
The interior of the overworked hall was
festooned with greenery against a tapestry
of red, white and blue, punctuated with the
symbols of the United Services, a burst-
ing rocket of electric lights raining from
the ceiling. Red mess-jackets were few and
far to seek; even the president, John Mon-
ash, had left his martial trappings amongst
the mothballs. With the ex-Anzac chief
was daughter Bertha Bennett, wearing velvet
brocades colored like early lilac. General
Chauvel’s wife wore black georgette with a
white fur selvage, and Admiral Hall Thomp-
son’s dame trailed black velvet. Lady For-
ster was charmingly brocaded in periwinkle
blue, while Lady de Chair was snug and
brown in chiffon velvet with georgette en-
tanglements. Little Valerie Hall Thomp-
son floated green-and-gold trimmings on a
dark sea of taffetas and tulle. The Lewis
Carnegies’ daughter, Mavis, just back from
a world scamper, was the one deb. of the
night, in a shimmering white creation filched
from Fairyland. Sharp eyes noted that our
smartest dressers lately back from overseas
twirled ankle-length frocks, and wore back
hair done up in a bun on the neck.
On this point of dress-length there ap-
pears to be a deadly conflict, however.
Paris is wearing its gowns much shorter
than T.ondon. According to the newest arri-
vals, the struggle seems to be going in the
direction of Paris; at any rate. London’s
calf was visibly lengthening.
The Richard Linton pair brewed a pot ol
tea in their South Yarra home on Derby
Sunday. The hostess handled the sugar-
tongs in a black frock bordered with gold
embossings which had travelled with her
from the French capital. It was a charm-
ing party, the guests wandering on the sun-
bathed lawns or in the shady parlors, accord-
ing to their fancy; and all stepped upstairs
to view far-off Macedon on one side and the
Dandenong Ranges on the other from the
flat roof-top. Those on familiar terms with
the arts of antiquity glared with ravished
eyes at the old prints, tapestries and furni-
ture scattered round the roomy home, while
a group of small children had a thin time
in the billiard-room listening-in to a broad-
casted sermon.
The cinema star who supplied the title
for the Louise Lovely ball at St. Kilda
Town Hall last week in aid of the Homoeo-
pathic Hospital fund was absent, but wasn’t
missed. Twenty per cent, of the jazzing
crowd which overpopulated the dance-floor
were fancy-dressed. The chief draw of the
evening was the grand parade of motley. A
group of hairy-chested males colored to look
like savage islanders provided food for
adverse comment by disrobing at the doors,
wearing nothing to hide their nakedness but
burnt cork and tiny kilts.
Lady Stradbroke being unable to preside
at the annual meeting of the Travellers’ Aid
Society, Dr. James Barrett stepped into the
breach and spoke the necessary words of
praise. Just when the concern was feel-
ing the pinch of confined quarters, E. M.
Pearce fairy-godmothered it with a £4OOO
loan, and a property has been got facing the
Flagstaff Gardens.
Mrs. William Boyd and her sister Mrs.
Herbert Lillies had a night of jazz in the
No. 9 Darling-street parlors to celebrate
the budding of their niece, Mary Macpher-
son. She budded sweetly in snowy geor-
gette banded with satin and hemmed
with pearls, with lilies-of-the-vallcy posied
in her hand. A cherry-lined train cheered
Mrs. Boyd’s black frock, while her
sister’s was tunicked with shimmering
blue. Irene Vanbrugh and members of her
company came in after their show.
Berwick sheltered its 1924 flower show-
cum-fete in the local hall last week; and
joyous sunshine drew the crowds from miles
around. Arthur Robinson’s dame, smartly
one-pieced in black under one of the inverted
bowls we nowadays call a hat, went up from
Melbourne to speak the opening words: and
flower-expert Bell and ex-mayoress Stein
passed sentence on the exhibits. Willie
a’Beckett startled his intimates by his his-
trionic ability as a lady vamp in a home-
made revue; and big Andrew Chirnside fed
the local school-children on icecreams with
a reckless disregard for the morrow.
A Titian-haired Circe, whose thrilling
frocks held up the eye-traffic at pre-war race
meetings, stepped ashore the other day from
an Orient liner with trunks loaded to the
Plimsoll. The quality and quantity of her
steamer trousseau kept her sister-passengers’
eyes skinned from London docks to Port
Melbourne pier. Usually the wearer aired
her acquisitions on a chair de luxe on the
main deck, and the message they conveyed
was that for day wear, at any rate, the
abbreviated skirts still have it.
This is Broothorn’s opinion of Leon Heron,
whose show of water-colors at the Saekville
Galleries closes

ever difficult it

ger of the Commercial Bank of Australia,

The Osborne and Jim Fairbairn matrons
gave a ball in the St. Kilda Town Hall last
week to welcome their youthful sister-in-law
Betty Fairbairn back from England, where
she lias been for the past year under the
wing of her brother-in-law and sister, General
and Mrs. Wheatley. The hall blushed pink
with 1 roses. Mrs. Osborne Fairbairn radi-
ated in clinging draperies of gentian blue,
while Mrs. .Tim sported lilac georgette shim-
mering with lilac and crystal headings.
Rufous-haired Betty’s crystal trimmings
weighted pink satin hangings. Lilac and
blue flowers cheered the supper tables backed
by wall draperies of the same blend. Ernest
Watt, over from Sydney, brought daughter
Pam, who looked like a Lorelei in sea-green
and silver.

who was also anxious to see the world in the
same economical fashion. Wherefore the
little family band has been one short for
many months.
Two women, one plump, the other
plumper, were (as usual) discussing the
reduction of flesh. Said the plumper: “Well,
I have at last really discovered a way to
get thin. I have been following my pre-
scription for three weeks and I’m losing
flesh at a great rate.” “Oh,” said the merely
plump: “I wish you’d tell me how you do
it.” “Of course, I will, my dear!” the
plumper began, and then broke off as a
third woman joined the group. The new-
comer took her bearings, and then beamed
on the very plump one. “Why, Oily.” she
gushed, “this is a surprise. I haven’t seen
you for months. And no need to ask how
you are—happy and contented, and fatter
than ever!”
Mrs. Fred Morton helped to puff up the
Girl Guides Funds with the takings of a
card-afternoon last week. The packs were
shuffled at Burnham and a contingent of
uniformed Guides conducted a campaign of
brigandage from a cake and sweet stall, while
a plain-clothes platoon hawked flowers and
fancy-goods for the cause.
On Friday night Mrs. Bob Simson gave
a dance for daughter Estelle and her pals
in Carlyon’s ballroom. Both wore black
frocks, the matron’s lightened with silver
and her daughter’s with a cascade of jet
beads down one shoulder. Alec Russell and
his good-looking wife, Betty Fairbairn, Pat
Clarke, Eunice Umphelby, Keith Officer and
Charlie Forrester were on the floor, and the
Dick Casey widow helped to chaperon them.
With the £2OO resulting from their ball
in aid of the S.P.C.A., the Montgomery sis-
ters have hired the foUr-leaved supplement
of the State School children’s magazine for
a fortnight, and will devote it to animal
politics. Mary Grant Bruce will contribute
a story. As the kiddies are supposed to
learn the contents of the magazine by heart
this bit of propaganda on behalf of our dumb
friends should do much good.
Bright little Cynthia Taylor, who has
just engaged herself to Jim Hunter, only
son of the woolgrowing Hunters, of Warra-
gul, is the daughter of Mrs. Roy Adam, of
Kyneton, and the late Frank Taylor, of the
Overnewton clan. On the maternal side the
bride-elect is a grand-daugliter of one of
Melbourne’s oldest social identities, Mrs. Wil-
liam Templeton.
A scientific friend in Westralia deplores
the growth of the golfing face among his
neighbors. He acknowledges he has no great
experience of golfers in other lands, but in
W.A. they develop a grimness of visage and a
sadness of manner which, he says, may be
due to the enjoyment of misery. At school
three of his chums were nicknamed Misery,
Woe and Anguish: the golf expression was
inherited—their father played a good game,
and the three are now enthusiasts. As a
scientist he regards this as such a serious
matter for the generations to come that he
thinks the National Council of Women ought
to add to their eugenics the rule that no male
and female of the golf species should marry.
From an Australian Wembleyan:—
All Australia-in-London has been visiting Edin-
burgh for an eyeful of August heather. A recent
group included the John Spencer Bruntons, with son
Tom and daughter Evelyn; Professor and Mrs.
Schofield have been at the local halls of learning;
“Jimmy” Murdoch and his family motored the
400 miles from London ; and Sydney solicitor Liebius
and his wife have been looking for a haggis, and
looking quite in vain. The Novars, whom we knew
as the Munro Fergusons, freely extend their
hospitality to old Australian friends at their stately
seventeenth-century home in Fife. From Raith entrance-
gate to the house is two miles through beautiful
park lands, the pride of the fine old woodman vis-
count. Within are some of the finest examples of
Raeburn’s art; and in the reception-rooms oddments
presented to the popular vice-royalties duiing their
regime in the Commonwealth hold pride of place.
Lady Doris Nugent, who as Lady Doris Blackwood
was with her aunt and uncle in Australia and
made many friends there, has been staying at
Raith during the Scotch season.
Agnes Murphy has been in Dublin for the
Horse Show and the revival of the ancient
Tailkeann games. She describes the city as
very crowded and gay. The streets, with the
National tri-color, and fantastic arrange-
ments of growing plants on Venetian masts,
and shrubs in picturesque jars, were very
festive, and were thronged up to half-past
10, when it was still light enough to distin-
guish the harp on the buttons of the soldiers’
uniforms, and to read —if you can—the
names of the streets, which are all in the
Irish language. The Count and Countess
Plunkett, James Stephens and a group of
political women, from the Countess Markie-
yicz to Mrs. Erskine Childers, are among the
interesting people the Australian has met.
Though it is 16 vears since Sir Reginald
Talbot was here, he and his lady still keep
in touch with Australians visiting the Cold
Country. They lately asked a big luncheon
party to Marlow, and afterwards entertained
a still bigger crowd at a garden party. Lady
Grey, widow of a one-time G.-G. of Canada,
who visited Sydney 10 years ago, helped
them extend the glad hand to their guests,
and they all had a busy day raking up for-
gotten threads of scandal, etc.
Adelaide’s Week:—
From Darwin comes news of the safe arrival of
Miss Philippa Bridges, his Ex.’s sister, who recently
overlanded with camels for transport and a black
boy and his lubra for companions. She had no
hardships to complain of except the dust, which :s
not unknown even down this end. At duty’s call his
Ex. has gone to Melbourne, and Lady Bridges—
after a flying visit to the H. H. Duttons, at Kapunda,
to open the Hospital Fete in their grounds—is busy
putting a final polish on local Guides and Guiders
before packing up for her own jaunt overseas.
The Education Department has presented itself with
another inspector of schools, and has chosen for
the job one of its best-known women teachers, Miss
Adelaide Miethke. She was president of tliiS Women
Teachers’ League for a good many years, and much
of the success of the Children’s Patriotic Fund during
the war was due to her. She annexed her B.A.
degree a year or two ago.
St. Mark’s College, the first attempt to establish
residential University life in this village, has taken
possession of the old John Downer home in North
Adelaide, and held an all-day fete at St. Peter’s College
to raise funds for furnishing. His Ex. opened the show
and so brisk was business that well over a thousand
was in hand before evening. In the evening lan
Hayward shepherded a dance, for which Mrs. Dudley
Hayward had designed yellow and autumn-tinted
decorations.
Birksgate, one of the most picturesque of the homes
that were tucked into the foothills in the days when
Mary Ann didn’t insist on being within speaking
distance of a picture palace, put on its gladdest rags
for the Tom Barr Smiths’ dance, given for their
daughter on the eve of her marriage to the Glen
Legoes’ son. From the wide verandahs and bal-
conies, and the sloping, sweet-scented garden, one
looked downwards to the myriad lights of the city
and lower suburbs and the faint rim of the sea
beyond. Dancing was in a marquee bowered with
flowers. Mrs. Barr Smith’s frock was of blue with
a touch of silver tissue; and, of her daughters, one
was in palest pink georgette that rippled to ostrich
feathers about her feet, and the other in beaded blue
georgette. Lady Bridges flung a cloak of vivid red,
beaded in black and crystal, over a slim frock of
gold and blue.
A Market Gardeners’ picnic was a pleasant re-
minder of a condition of things existing in and
around Adelaide. Getting the soil to yield its best is
here considered a most honorable employment,
whether the crop is wool, wheat or carrots. The
alluvial deposit of ages along the Torrens is ideal
soil for citrus fruits, and, two or three miles further,
the cooler air of the hills is equally good for apples,
cherries and such things. Vegetables grow to per-
fection over a wide area, and the hand of the China-
man is unknown. The picnic brought along the
decorated vehicles of hundreds of professional gar-
deners.
The Outer Harbor, now backed by nothing but
sand and swamp, is to be made more attractive for
ocean passengers who may not have time to go un
to the city. A committee has obtained a lease of
seven acres, which will be laid out for cricket, foot-
ball and tennis, with special children’s playgrounds.
The cost is estimated at £3OOO. Shipping firms
and passengers are subscribing freely. ■
The agitation for removing Government House
has been started again. A few years back both it
and the University were to go out into the suburbs;
but the latter has anchored itself by obtaining more
land on the old spot and putting up big new build-
ings. The City Corporation is now suggesting a
scheme for utilising Government House domain by
moving the Town Hall to its south-western corner,
and putting up new Law Courts —badly needed —-at
the north-western. But there is a long way to go
before any of the dreams are realised.

of Isko are the two rotating
gears of the compressor, which
run submerged in a sealed
chamber of oil and are direct
connected to the
motor. The refrigerant—a
harmless gas—is also sealed in
its chamber. When cooled
under moderate pressure it be-
comes a liquid, and as such is
supplied to the expansion coil
of the tank, where it expands
into gaseous form, extracting
the heat from the chest. When
it has absorbed its quota of
heat the compressor removes it
from the expansion coil and
delivers it to the condenser

the gas again becomes a liquid

WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY
Kayser
GIOVES
The big feminine rally of the week was
the Women-J.P.’s Conference. To it Avas
beckoned not only Justices from all the
States that have them, but nominees from
those which sit with Maoriland in outer
darkness with never a woman J.l\ to throw
a beam or a mote in the eye of Justice.
Mayor Gilpin opened the first day’s work
with a tea-drinking in his oavii sanctum in
the Town Ilall. Here the ladies finally
scratched themselves into comfortable nest-
ing positions'—Miss Preston Stanley and
Mrs. Glencross right up at the head table,
and the others about the room. The visi-
tors made speeches calling upon Heaven and
the Mayor to witness how grateful they
were to be present on this epoch-making occa-
sion. Victorian Mrs. Glencross had rather
more to say than anybody else; Miss Pres-
ton Stanley put her appreciation in so many
swaddling clothes that the baby seemed un-
duly small when finally unwound; and lastly
Mrs. Edward Byrne, who founded the J.P.
Union, dropped a few words into the argu-
ment. Then came photographs on the steps
in front of the civic stronghold, and the con-
ference Avas on.
There were so many good things on the
Jaypees’ agenda paper that it Avas a pity
the elements crashed on the second day.
Somebodv objected to a ruling of May Mat-
thews, who was in the chair in the absence
of the president. Miss Preston Stanley;
and before you could waggle a pacifist powder-
puff the Feminist Club was splitting with
alarums and discursions. May Matthews
was out of the chair, Mrs. Kenna (as shock-
absorber) Avas in it. May Matthews was
voted back. As she stepped up Mrs. Kenna
stepped down without so much as the tremb-
ling of a hair, and retired to her place on
the rim of things—one of the striking
figures of the conference. May Matthews,
rather didactic, her A'oice cool and steady
in spite of the hot flush from chin to fore-
head, kept Her head and the meeting from
disaster. Across the disturbance Mrs.
Melville, in blue marocains, exploded
lute a packet of crackers —rather with the
air of a small boy roguishly aware that his
explosives arc only squibs, though he’d like
the other chap to think them bombs. Mrs.
Williams, from Queensland, seemed to re-
flect that Brisbane Avasn’f the hottest spot
in the Continent, after all. Mrs. Hadfield
(Maoriland) threw a wet blanket on the
(rubers with her canonical atmosphere—her
husband’s father was Primate of Maoriland
for scons. Mrs. Glencross (Victoria) wore
the most feathers ; and of these emancipated
women, every third sported a slave bangle.
A gale that threatened to blow the per-
fect ladyhood of the National Council of
Women as far as the lions’ den at Taronga
swept the monthly meeting of the Old Grena-
diers last week. It may have been a vibra-
tory fragment from the lady Justices’ argu-
ment, or it may have been the thunder in
the weather ; anyAvay, the Highland Society’s
rooms rumbled as though a dozen pipe bands
Avere at rehearsal. Mrs. Jamieson Williams,
AA'ho has an accent as Scotch as putting the
caber or caller herrin’, has asked the Coun-
cil to stand behind her when she nominates
as an Independent candidate for North Syd-
ney. Of course, the National Council is
non-political; and as several other members
are standing for Parliament, there was a
great outcry which came to this: “Treat
everybody alike, or stick to your guns and
keep out of politics altogether.” One lady
took her coat off to it, and feeling ran just
as high as at the J.P. gathering, though
there was more restraint. It ended by Mrs.
Jamieson Williams withdrawing her request,
and Mrs. Uaverty and friends of the absent
Miss Preston Stanley Avcnt into the rain-
sAvept evening wearing a smile like that on
the face of the tiger.
The Griffen Foley testimonial concert was
from the point of money returns a great
disappointment. When it was finally known
that Melba could not sing, hundreds of
pounds’ Avortli of tickets were sent back to
the management. That was rough on Mrs.
Foley; rough, too, on Edna Thomas, who
generously lent her warble and repertoire for
the' occasion. Faithful John Lemmone and
the brilliant De Cairos Rego girl were sup-
porting artists; Iris added a delicate piece of
work from her own pen to make the night
memorable. Edna Thomas has an attractive
personality and a Devonshire cream sort of
voice. In lier frilly crinolines and black
ringlets she looked like a daguerrotypc of
the days when the toast was “General Lee
and the Southern rebels.” The singer, who
specialises in “negro spirituals” and planta-
tion songs, is from New Orleans, though she
admits that her family has only 80-odd years
of the South in its veins; pianist Miss
Ilyams’s people go back a hundred and fifty.
After her successful first meeting with
Sydney audiences Miss Thomas decided to
give four recitals; and, strangely, her negro
songs will christen the new Tlieosopliical
Hall in Bligh-street. This brand-new build-
ing is the only hall in Sydney not booked
right into the New Year.
Sydney is too self-conscious to really
enjoy a Hallowe’en party. Though the
Wentworth was crowded on Friday night with
wliite-slieeted figures below pumpkin-capped
heads, there wasn’t any great mirth among
the dancers. Perhaps jazz frightens away
the half-shuddering enjoyment that is the
thrill of charms and spells ; anyway, every-
body heaved a sigh of relief when the mock
cerements could be thrown aside. The hos-
pitals were strongly represented. Mona
Daley brought her about-to-be, and George
Fitzpatrick, of St. Margaret’s, came with his
dark-haired wife and a large party that in-
cluded his first lieutenant. May Sheehan.
Another notable figure was Dean Talbot, who
took the floor with his just-home-again wife.
Professor MacCallum blushed to hear hi-
praises sung by president Brunsdon Fletcher
at the Journalists’ lunch the other day. The
great little scholar is going to address the
highbrow British Academy by special re-
quest, and leaves for England shortly with
his slender lady. Allan Wilkie, also at the
top table, made a brief response to apprecia-
tive remarks concerning his Sliakspearean
plays, and said he had even been guilty of
dramatic criticism. He had written accounts
of his own performances. “And there are
none I like better!” he confessed. H. J.
Stephens, who is going to Geelong to edit a
paper, was farewelled at the same party.
There was a pleasant little dance in the
messroom of Victoria Barracks on the very
wet Saturday night of last week. The
hosts were the president and members of the
staff corps. General Brand brought a slim
daughter; Major B'&'ryman, secretary of the
committee, was hard on the track of wall-
flowers ; little Heather Cramsie was a poin-
settia in lacquer-red velvet, and the tones of
a petunia were supplied by Mrs. Wilson’s
taffetas. All the senior officers in barracks
twirled on the polished boards, and the
shingled head (it was a Younger Set
soirfie) moved sedately in the two-step. Miss
Laurence Brown, in a black frock (she’s a
grand-daughter of the late Colonel Mac-
kenzie, who was once a brass-hat here), had
on one of the latest turban scarves with a
gold tassel to tickle one pink ear. Two young
men from 11.M.A.5. Brisbane added a naval
touch to the dance.
May Moore’s camera caught Mrs. James
Williams in one of that lady’s half-hours
away from
the Women-
J.P.’s Confer-
ence last
w e e k. She
was a Bris-
bane nominee
to the council
of war; at
home she is
a vice-presi-
dent of the
Nati o n a 1
Council. A
quiet - looker,
she has organ-
ising ability,
is a vice-pre-
sident of the
Wattle League,
and holds the
same office in
the northern
State’s branch
of the Women’s
Christian Temperance Union.
Captain Kellog, the Naval Governor of
American Samoa, is of an attractive lean-
ness, middle-aged, grey-liaired—looks as
though he might have been one of the austere
villagers in “Miles Standisli.” Her Ex., on
the other hand, is interestingly voluble. Slim
as a willow wand, her face is weather-burnt
and her eyes have the narrowed, observant
look of an Australian outbacker’s. The
poeti'y and the problem of Samoa have cap-
tured her fancy, and she sketched a vignette
of the sailors’ monthly dance at Pago. It is
held in the drill hall, the music supplied by
the Governor’s native band. These present
a colorful sight, their bronzed limbs like
something the old Greeks might have hewn,
escaping from blue- and red-striped lava-
lavas and white tunic shirts. The sailors in
their white ducks are partnered by native
and half-caste girls, who combine their vel-
vety eyes with bright pink, blue, green and
red dresses and white shoes and stockings
—quite like the American miss.
At Government House in Sydney the
Ivellogs met somebody who had heard about
them 20 years ago. It was Lady de Chair,
who immediately recalled to them an old
friend of Captain Kellog’s mother. Her Ex.
remembered things this friend had spoken
of them two decades since.
The American Consular Lawtons gave a
star-and-barred sliivoo in the visitors’ honor
on Friday afternoon in the Rose Bay Golf
Club House; and on Saturday evening the
medical Dan Kellys, of Kirribilli, filled Wara-
nilla with rosy lights, jazz and bridge to
their further glory. For this function Mrs.
Kellog flew black Spanish lace, with a dis-
creet diamond or two and a creamy gardenia
to finish. Mrs. Dan did the honors in peri-
winkle blue georgettes, flashing with bead
embroideries; and sister Dorothy, in frothy
pinks, and Miss Coffee, in black brocades and
ivory lace, helped on the good work in the
reception-rooms. A sister, Mrs. Hughes,
brought her doctor ; and a Courtney girl or
two, the pretty Miss Aliearn and pianist
Frank Hutchens were among the crowds that
danced everywhere. Dr. Dan kept order
among the snooker fiends.
May Moore presents a charming and attrac-
tive little person in Margot Toner, a Maori-
land product,
who plays the;
piano with
something
very close to
inter preta-
ti v e genius.
She came over
to Sydney
with a scholar-
sh i p about
three years
ago, and
teacher Laur-
ence Godfrey
Smith hopes
soon to flash
her before Syd-
ney audiences.
Her playing
at a Con. stu-
dents’ concert
the other
week won her
a pile of flat-
taring notices. Margot isn’t 18 yet. A
sister, Daflye, is married to French Vice-
Consul Tanqueray.
Mona Daley leaves off being secretary of
the Crown-street Women’s Hospital to be-
come Queen of the Green Coupons. Her
newly betrothed is A. G. Godhard, director
of that wonderful institution which in
exchange for a million or so of cash
coupons will furnish the kitchen with a
glittering phalanx of aluminium pots and
pans. On its financial side Mona has been
the high priestess of the Women’s Hospital
for nine years, and before that she was in
the commercial world —it was she who taught
the Strickland girls how to write Pitman.
Mr. Godhard is a widower whose other vices
are dancing and the writing of album verse.
Major Thompson, of the Staff Corps, Vic-
toria Barracks, will soon place a plain gold
band on the finger of Nora Westcott, daugh-
ter of the Henry Westcotts, of Wollstone-
craft. There will be a cutting of cake at the
Mary Elizabeth after the business in grey old
St. Philip’s.
Artist Lister Lister is paying particular
attention to the cut of white kid gloves, with
a view to the day when he will hand daugh-
ter Muriel over to Geoffrey Lamb, of London.
The ’groom’s people on both sides belong to
old Army families. Muriel is the Lister
Listers’ only chick, and both she and the
young man are well favored in looks.
Another of the happy bediamonded sister-
hood is Doreen Walsh, of Briglxton-le-Sands.
Her to-be is Captain Stanley Cox, of Geelong.
When the lift-men in Farmer’s see any
girl between 16 and 60 step into their air-
craft these days, they know she is to be
delivered to the fourth floor. For here the
trousseau which is one of the prizes in the
Christmas Art Union for St. Margaret’s is
displayed. This fragrant heap of crepe de
Chine and good lace is valued at £lOO, and
for one shilling a man can buy an art-union
ticket that is really a Christmas card, add
his signature and send it to any girl who has
been treating him to dinner and the theatre
for the past six months. In this way he'll
wipe off his debt of hospitality, and if she
wins she’ll be grateful enough to do any-
thing for him—even to the marrying of him!
The Children’s Hospital lost a generous
friend and worker when William Percy Faith-
full died at The Monastery, the old home
with the wide sweep of lawns at Neutral
Bay. The shyest of men, he wanted to hide
behind the blackboard when, years ago,
veteran headmaster Weigall, of Sydney
Grammar, introduced him to the boys as “the
bravest man I ever knew.” The description
w T as due partly to a little incident arising
out of a meeting with bushrangers when
Percy Faitlifull was little more than a lad.
He w’as a member of the old Goulburn family
and was educated for the Bar; but he had
no liking for the law, and, having no need to
either toil or spin, devoted the later years of
liis life to good books aud good deeds. Child-
less himself, his favorite charity was the
Children’s Hospital, and his hero was Dr.
Clubbe, for so long its head. Mrs. Faithfull
survives him to receive a flood of sympathy.
Sydney Jewry lost a kindly old lady when
Mrs. Wolinski died the other day. She was
the mother of artist Wolinski and wife of
the Rev. A. D. Wolinski, who has been one
of the minor ministers of the Great Syna-
gogue for 40 years.
The girl in the flat opposite says she is
going to start a Society for the Institution
of Jungles. Ever since she read that eye-
man Undo Ferguson recommends a jungle
a day to keep pince-nez away, she has felt
that it is her mission in life to see that
forests are scattered about the landscape.
For instance, a juicy jungle between the
Quay and Martin-place would provide the
Harborside business man and girl with a
nice bit of eye-exercise morning and evening.
Instead of the'butchers and smallgoods shops
where man now snatches his evening meat, a
few tigers and elephants and other citizens
from Taronga might be let loose. Then man
could track his own tiger steak or elephant’s
brains, or perhaps even his wife’s snakeskin
shoes, on his way to the 5.30 ferry. By
this simple jungle contrivance mannequins
also could keep their eyelashes curled and
their figures slim by climbing nut-trees or
pursuing wild fruit. At the entrance and
exit (which, of course, the wild animals
would be prevented from passing by a Statute
of Limitations) reputable caretakers would
be in charge of the lockers in which each
citizen would keep his initialled leopard-
skin and stone-axe.
At the close of a lecture in the Education
Gallery the other night the very superior
Girton product turned to her merely-Sydney-
girl neighbor and, with that air of enlighten-
ing the native which that kind of English per-
sou adopts, drawled: “The old boy wouldn't
be so band if he knewoo how to speak;
but, reahlly, somebody ought to give him
some lessons in English—how she should
be spoken!” “Perhaps you’re right,” agreed
her Australian neighbor reflectively; “but
father has been speaking like that for 6)
years, and I’m afraid he wouldn’t care to
change now!” Then the Girton (or was it
Newnham?) girl sank for the ninth time, and
resuscitation is still going strong.
Brisbane’s annotations:—
Sir Matthew has been advising the people of Tam-
bourine Mountain not to lay out their prospective
city on the ruins of the natural beauty of the site.
Tambourine hopes to be a city of 10,000 righteous
men, and it seems a pity the top o’ the hill cannot
be reserved as a park, for it is lovely scrub country,
where the staghorn and the bird’s-nest fern abound.

PROPELY
The V.R.C. lias had great improvements
made at Flemington, but the charge of £1 to enter
the £150,000, stand is not relished by its patrons.
Very few paid it on Saturday, when Spearfelt gave
Voung another easy ride in the Derby. Spearhead's
fine son was never better than 7 to 4 on, and for
once the odds were justified, for the blown colt
came home six lengths ahead of Royal Charter
(10’s), with Versine, allegedly 14 to 1, heading the
others, who were a weary lot indeed. The favorite
missed the jump-out, and was disputing the rear
position with Solidify as they left the straight,
but once Young moved on him he went through
his field like a good one'; and, considering that he
was on the bit over the last two furlongs, the
time —2min. 35sec. —was excellent. For a Welkin
filly that hadn’t been further than a mile in public,
Versine shaped respectably, and the Oaks appears
as soft for her as tiie Derby was for Spearfelt. And
Royal Charter was running on well at the finish.
Those who laid 5 to 2 on Gloaming for the Mel-
bourne Stakes had a rather thrilling five minutes.
First, Bold and Bad lashed out at the old fellow
at the post ; and then the ancient got into a pocket,
with Whittier and Easingwold in front of him, and
Bold and Bad at his side. * For a moment McShort-
odds, who remembered what had happened in the Hill
Stakes at Rosehill, was a very jubilant layer of
dynamite prices. But, racing into the straight, Young
took his mount up smartly and around the two
leaders to the front, and the rest was chiefly loud
applause, with owner Greenwood tugging excitedly at
his bushy moustache. Gloaming ran the 10 furlongs
in 2min. sfsec., and was going easily at the end, three-
quarters of a length ahead of Whittier and another
two lengths in front of Easingwold, who has earned
a lot of third money for his AVestralian owner. It
was Whittier’s third successive seecnl at w.f.a.
Ben Chaffey’s little brown has been very unlucky
this season, and he was favoring his dicky pin when
Dempsey pulled him up.
A plunge on Blackadder caused The Night Patrol
to ease from evens to 5 to 4 for the Cantala Stakes,
and brought the Epsom Handicap winner from 3’s
to 9to 4. The Hawk was firm at 7’s, but few wagers
were laid about the others. After Blackadder had
led for six furlongs Lewis let the Governor’s horse
have his head, and Blackadder was soon settled, but
The Hawk was not so easily shaken off; in fact,
Lewis had to ride all he knew to get the favorite
home by a neck. Beeline was third, Englefield fourth,
Blackadder (fading) fifth and Cliffdale last. The
Hawk’s showing was a great improvement on his
ignominous performance at the Valley, but Pike
weighed in 2Jlb. light, and second money went to
Beeline’s owner, while J. M. Cameron was fined £lO.
He it was who saddled up his Maoriland gelding,
and his carelessness was very costly, for the second
prize was worth £4OO, and he had £2OO on for
a place (covering a £2OO s.o. wager) at 2 to 1.
* * * *
The said Dempsey was seen at his best on Manacle
(TO to 9 on) in the Maribvrnong Plate. Petunia, ridden
by Lewis, caught the favorite a short distance from
the judge, and seemed to have the race wen but
Dempsey rode a splendid finish and squeezed his colt
home by a head. The fortunate youth was on another
wirn r, Lilypond, in the Hotham Handicap—liis
third for the clay and the sixth favorite to succeed.
There was a Holt plunge on the AVestralian gelding
(he started at 3’s), as there had been at the Valley,
and the hostile demonstration was fatuous, especially
as the Lilyveil gelding is more at home over 12
furlongs in open company than nine in the w.f.a.
class. It was a taking Cup trial ; but. sound critics
judged it less impressive than that of Backwood, who
ran from third last to third in three furlongs, passing
13 others.
There were wild reports in Melbourne on Tuesday
about Stand By having gene wrong at the eleventh
hour and Spearfelt having been injured on the way
to the course. They were true to the extent that
the South Australian hurt himself slightly after
galloping in the morning, and he receded in the
betting; but McShortodds showed his opinion of
the Spearfelt story by shortening his quote to 2 to
1. Mcne.v came solidly for Backwood. who firmed
on the course from 14's to 10’s, B’s being asked when
they were lined up at the barrier. Baekwood’s sup-
porters duly- collected ; the English horse was first,
Stand By second and Spearfelt third. There were
heads between them, and the time was 3min. 261 see.
A six-yea r-old bay stallion by Bachelor’s Double —
Lady of Grace, the 1924 Cup winner showed good
form in England, where he got away with the
Ascot Derby in 2min. 32 3-ssec., but this was his
first success in Australia. In last year’s Cup he
was 10th with Bst. 131 b. ; on this ocasion he carried
Bst. 2lb. He is trained at Flemington by Brad-
field for Baillieu, Clark and Hughes, and was ridden
by the Sydney horseman, “Bunty” Brown.

Kinaslot’s lialf-brothor Serelot, by Sere-
mond —Lotehen, had a comfortable win in the
Queensland Derby. Mountain Song was a better
favorite, but the filly failed to stay, and the big
Sydney chestnut Strongbow, who was second favorite
with Serelot at 4’s, showed no dash at all. He is
doubtless the makings of a good horse, but he requires
time. Chippa Shoon, an 8 to 1 chance, was second
and Memcraft, a rank outsider, third. Old Tanga-
looma was a starter in the w.f.a. Spring Stakes, and
there was a bit of money for him at B’s, but lie

“Machete”: The Brisbane noddy that re-
cently won a good race at Kcdron Park after being
purchased from a butcher's cart for 30s. has
since had his eye wiped at Epping (N.S.W.) trots
Chaffo, a winner at Epping, pulls a pony cart for
his owner’s daughter when not on the track or
hauling feed from the produce markets. Hidden
Treasure, successful on the same clay, earns his
regular hay in an ice-cart. He won at Richmond
on Monday, worked in the ice-cart on Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday, had a track spin on
Friday, and upset a hot-pot, Nikola, by a head in
the Trial Handicap at Epping on the Saturday.
That’s what one might call making the best of a
horse.
* * * *
“C.A.M.” The Veracitv-Tyrone-Lobstor
par. (B. 23/10/’24) recalls another instance when
a cable interpreter mixed up the placed horses in an
English race with the preceding item. A Sydney
evening paper was the victim ; it was the year when
Chevalier Ginistrelli’s flying filly Signorina won the
Lancashire Plate, with Orme second and Martagon
third. The race result followed the account of
some audacious work by Italian brigands, and this,
inter alia, was what the public read under the head-
ing of “Brigandage Extraordinary”: “The town of
Bari, in Italy, has been subjected to repeated acts
"f brigandage bv a b-'ud headed by a voung and
lovely lady, a certain Signorina Orme Martagon....
Having looted the town and taken hostages from
the principal inhabitants, the fair leader and her band
of robbers retired to their mountain fastnesses.”
And I presume the unhappy cable-faker also retired
to some fastness when he read the true account in
his loathly contemporaries—perhaps to a hollow log.

It is so long since South Australia won
a Sheffield Shield match that the Victorians, cham-
pions in 1921-22 and 1923-24, were quite unprepared
for the trouble they struck in Adelaide at the week-
end. With the third ball bowled, Wallace, the
Prahran express, struck out Wainwright, who plays
with the Colts ; then Gordon Harris and J. T. Murray
put on 205 for the second wicket. Harris, a
patient Port Adelaide batsman, had the cruel luck to
be run out at 98, but the tall A.I.F. man kept on
until he had made 126 (in 232 minutes), when
Ryder snapped him up off Hendry. The youngster
had a couple of lives, but Murray’s innings was
chanceless. Vic Richardson (123), Grimmett (49),
A. J. Richardson (24), Walsh (27) and Williams (30
n. 0.) continued the good work, and the board showed
528 when the last wicket fell. The captain’s 123
were made in 145 minutes. It was easily the best
innings he has ever played, and his cutting was
reminiscent of Harry Trott and other great old-
timeis —it is a stroke that has gone out of fashion
in these days of the two-eyed stance. At the close
of the second day’s play, Victoria was 486 behind
with eight wickets in hand, Mayne and Park having
been dismissed cheaply.
Between showers on the
third day Tarrant
justified the selectors
with a valuable, if
dreadfully slow, 86;
and Ellis, the stumper,
helped him to add 157
for the third wicket.
Ellis's share being 69 ;
but Ponsford and
Woodfull offered little
resistance. Victoria

this report had to hurry
to the printer.

racecourses.
“M.H.” : In 121 completed innings v. Victoria since
Xl-aside matches began in 1880, S. Aus. has only
thrice exceeded 518. It made 590 in 1909, 562 in
1891 and 543 in 1920- —all on the Adelaide Oval. The
Victorians have beaten the S.A. effort seven times:
in 1920, they pasted the Adelaide bowling for 724 at
Melbourne.
' * * * *
“S.T.S.” : A curious incident lias happened
in Adelaide club cricket, Pincombe, a veteran from
Broken Hill, was battifig for Glenelg when a ball
was stopped just inside the boundary, the fieldsman
falling in the process. It looked just like a
boundary, and the batsman, having run an easy one,
was strolling back to the other end for the four,
when the ball came back and he was run out. The
opposing captain did not wish to take advantage of
the decision, but run out it was, and remained. It
would do no harm to have a law that no batsman
shall suffer for being innocently out of his ground
under a mistake of fact. The commonest case is
that of mishearing a not-out decision for l.b.w. If
a man starts for the pavilion in front of his wicket
he is always liable to be run out. I once saw
W. G. Grace move up from point to take the ball
when the wicketkeeper had to go after a tap to square
leg. W.G. not being the ’keeper, the ball was not
technically dead after its return to the wicket; but
Sam Jones, who had run a safe single to that end,
thought it was, and was patting down a lump on
the pitch when Grace used the ball he was nursing
OUT OF HER ELEMENT.
THE NOVICE : “ Caddie , I want you to tell me
what sort of club would suit me best.”
THE CRITIC : “I think a swim min' club ,

to remove a bail. There was a great fuss, but
W.G. took the simple ground that rules are rules,
and he had to do the best he could, within them,
for his side.
* * * *
xren”: Gamble. Rayson, uiiulrey and
Ebeling are not the only promising young Victorian
cricketers (B. 30/10/’24). Syd Hastings, of Carlton,
has bowled this season as well as anyone; his three
goes have yielded him 5 for 55, 6 for 36 and 2 for
45, while in the game against Northeote he showed
he could bat by making a confident 56 against
Hartkopf (7 for 77), who scattered his mates like
ninepins. There is cricket in the Hastings family,
for Syd’s brother Stan is a valuable member of the
strong Prahran side, and their dad, Tom Hastings,
kept wicket for Victoria years ago. Against South
Oss in 1903 Tom and the present Victorian selector,
Matt Ellis, put up the record last-wicket partnership
of 211. Another colt who should be helped along
is Keith Millar, of Hawthorn-E. Melbourne. Only
18 and a born athlete, on Saturday he made 81 of
the combine’s 163 and took two of Melbourne’s three
wickets for 25. East winter Richmond persuaded
his people to let him play with them, and he became
a star footballer on his first game. He was, indeed,
the find of the season.
* * * *
“Machete”: The Victorian Junior C. A.
takes after father, as regards its attitude to Sydney
cricket. At a meeting of the Junior Ass. in Mel-
bourne, a considerable fuss developed over the selec-
tion of the Australian Junior XI which is to meet
the Englishmen at Sydney in December, the cause
being a N.S.W. request that the Victorian and S.
Aus. Juniors should send over three reps, each, sub-
ject to final selection by M. A. Noble. The N.S.W.
Juniors were accused of taking control of the
show, after it had been agreed that a committee from
the three States concerned would do so —-Queensland,
as usual, is left out in the cold. The Victorian
committee at first tried to withdraw from the affair
altogether, but it was at length resolved to make
terms with the enemy over the Murray. The ulti-
matum says that four reps, from Victoria and S.A.
are to be brought over to Sydney, and at least three
of each lot must be selected. The Victorians have
this much .in their favor, that most of their junior
players are thoroughly accustomed to turf wickets,
while over this side concrete is the rule. M. A.
Noble should have a peculiar interest in leading the
junior side, for it was with a team of colts against
Stoddart’s side in 1894 that he first came into
prominence.
* * * *
“G. 0.8.”: Owen McGonehie is really a
wonderful junior cricketer (B. 16/10/’24), and
I am positive that he would have won inter-State
honors if his ambition had soared in that direction.
For years hundreds have flowed from his bat, and
his bowling and fielding have been first-class. But,
being of a homely and modest temperament, he has
always preferred to play with the kindred he grew
up amongst rather than seek distinction among
strangers. Years ago, however, Richmond folk per-
suaded him that it was the duty of a man of his
ability to help the penmnt team from its position
near the foot of the list. He went across, but was
received as if he were a suspicious character, so lie
joyfully returned to the bosom of the family XI, and
began to hit up more hundreds than before.
* * * *
“Past Grammar” : The Marylebone C. C.
heads, after years of consideration, have at last
decided to permit the covering of the pitch, but
they have drawn up a weird set of rules and regu-
lations which promise to make the luck of the
game an even bigger factor than it is with an un-
covered wicket. At 11 a.m. the day before a
match the wicket may be covered till play begins
and then afterwards when necessary, and after
play ceases. But, once the match starts, the cover-
ing must not protect a larger area than 18ft. x 12ft.
at each end, nor must it project more than 3itt.
up the pitch from each popping crease. That wifi
mean that 71 feet from the wicket at each end
will be covered, while the remainder of the pitch
is exposed to the rain. The fact is that 34 feet
from the popping crease is just about a medium-
pace bowler’s length to a batsman of average reach,
while fast bowlers pitch shorter and slow ones a
bit longer. If the luck goes that way, the fast
bowler will have a rain-altered wicket to operate
on, while the medium bowler will have a sort of
combination of, say, sticky and hard, and the slow
bowler a dry, well-surfaced pitch—about the last
thing most of them pray for. The batsman, too,
will have some reason to complain, for he is likely
to get a curious variety of balls to play—that is, if
the uncovered part of the pitch has been affected
b' r the weather. One good feature of the scheme
is that bowlers will get a firm foothold for
delivering the ball, which is more than they do
under present wet-weather conditions.
* * * »
“Centurion” : “S.T.S.” falls foul of D. 11.
Lawrence (B. 30/10/’24) for making his cricketing
hero lose his wicket to a “terrific full pitch, 1 ’ -.vhiin
“came down crash over his head on to the middle
wicket.” But the high full-toss, coming down
almost perpendicularly on the bails, used to be a
favorite with good lob bowlers. Simpson-Havward.
of Worcestershire, and Jephson, of Surrey, both utilised
its possibilities 20 years or so ago, and wrote
learnedly' on the subject. Humphries, who came
out to Australia with one of Stoddart’s teams as a
lob bowler, also did good work with this ball. Of
lesser fry, writer can recall one Hollingsworth, of
Townsville (N.Q.), who caught many a mug, nid
skilled batsmen, too, with the aerial bomb, which,
if it was hard to bowl accurately, was a dashed
sight harder to play. His method was to pitch the
batsman up two or three nice half-volleys, and then,
when the happy smiter was right on his toes for a
sixer, to wheel up one which, if it missed going
down the back of his shirt, often hit the stumps, li
is very difficult, too, to hit a ball coming right
down on the top of one’s head without sending it
spinning up for an easy catch.
* * * *
George Parker, who was second in the
seven-mile walk at Antwerp in 1920 —his conqueror
was the Italian Frigerio, who won at Paris this
year—is back in the heel-and-toc game, and at the
Sydney Sports Ground on Saturday he made now
Australasian figures for five miles (37min. 40 2-ssec.),
six miles (45min. 194 sec.), and seven miles (53min.
2 2-ssec.). The last-mentioned time was within
2min. 21 3-ssec. of the world’s best, and it was
established on a sodden track. Parker’s meritorious
achievement so delighted two Sydney papers that
they styled him a “brilliant” walker. A “brilliant”
walker has never been seen, and never will be.
* * * *
A couple of months ago a contributor
talked about Mark Tandy, of South Melb., and his
little bit of trouble over a collision with Eicke, of
St Kilcla. Tandy thinks this contributor implied
that he (“Napper”) deliberately struck Eicke with
his elbow. Eicke told the League he thought it
was deliberate; Tandy said “he had no recollection
of the incident. He and Eicke raced for the ball and
he (Tandy) got away with it. Then he turned
round and saw Eicke on the ground. He might
have run into Eicke, but could not swear to it.”
That statement doesn’t sound as though the crash
was deliberate; and after hearing other evidence
and discussing the matter in private, the delegates
decided to take no action. If The Bulletin’s previ-
ous statement of the case can be taken to mean
anything else, it wasn’t what was intended, and this
paper is sorry. It has known of Tandy as a
player of League football for one team for 17 years,
and it recognises him as the best rover in the State
and one of the most*popular players—and he is popu-
lar because he is a hard worker, always a trier, and
always entirely fair; what he gives he is quite
prepared to take.

The All Blacks. after a full week for pre-
paration. won their first international game against
Ireland by 6 points (1 try and a penalty goal) to
nil. The Irish have always specialised in a rushing,
tearing, forward game, without gloves, and this team
seems to have been well up to standard, for it
fairly smothered the Black backs in the opening
stages helped by a wet ground and ball. But in
the second spell ‘ the Black forwards stemmed all at-
tacks, and Svenson scored a try, Nepia later goaling
a penalty. The 1905 All Blacks beat Ireland 15—0.
So far the Blacks have scored 337 to 32, as against
343 to 22 in 1905, with the opposition certainly
much improved.
* * * *
“Centurion” ; The gates for the All Black
matches in England have been so Satisfactory that
Scotland is on the verge of revolution at the
thought that the Scottish Union refused to sanction
games against the visitors. The Scottish K. L.
has flatlv refused to reconsider the matter, and
there is ‘talk of playing at least one game again;!
the Maorilanders, whether the Union consents or
not. As the Scottish body is about the last crowd
of its sort in existence to take such conduct lying
down, the rebels will have to face the possibility
of suspension, or worse, if they persist in their
treasonable practices.

AA r hat’s AA’oolley’s size in collars, eh?
And Chapman's shade in socks?
Does Hendren like the siphon’s hiss
Or tike his quencher neat?
There isn’t much these scribes will miss;
But rest, meanwhile, assured of this—
Tate hasn’t mammoth feet.

The Cup that Cheers
yet harbors no regrets
The taste for “a gamble” that is ingrained
in most Australians should never be given
rein to in the matter of selecting a stimulant.
Then, since health of body and mind is
largely at stake, there should be no ‘‘Trusting
to Luck,” no blind “ Picking of a Fancy.”
Choice should be guided by absolute cer-
tainty as to the merits of the particular
beverage chosen.
The claims of Wolfe’s Schnapps to first pre-
ference on all occasions rest on the fact that
while it is essentially a pure stimulant, it is
primarily a health beverage, performing the
definite medicinal function of assisting to
keep the blood stream pure.
Your investment on stimulants will return
pleasing dividends in improved Physical and
Mental Well-being if it takes the form of
“one Wolfe’s Schnapps a day for your Health’s
Sake.”

THE pistons of a motor engine must
fit to the thousandth part of an
inch, and require a film of oil as fine as
a spider s web. This thin film of oil
must he capable of withstanding enor-
mous heat and the frictional pressure of
metal surfaces moving at tremendous
speeds. And it must he able to do this
throughout the entire operation of the
motor; not merely part of the time.
The weaving of a spiders weh
calls for the most patient care. So
does the preparation of lubricating
oils, and “Shell" taker particular care
to ensure their lubricating oils are
durable enough under all conditions
ifor the most exacting service. jzt £?

“Lindesay”: . Ask “Adelaide’s” biggest
shout (B. 16/10/’24) to take a back seat. At
the opening of the Country Club in Blackall
(W.Q.), Arthur Whittingham, squatter and
“good sport,” poured out liquor to the tune
of £BO.
“Wingella”: Some day the waterfalls of
the Northern Territory may be harnessed to
provide for hydro-electric power. There are
at least three in the Territory over 690 ft. in
height. Though few people realise it, the
N.T. has far more water-power than Tas-
mania.
Just died in Maoriland, at 50, Ernest
Short, Romney Marsh and Hereford
breeder. At the Argentine Exhibition 12
years ago his Romneys won the world's
championship. He was a racehorse-owner
and breeder, too, one of his successes being
Demos. His late residence at Parorangi.
Feilding (N. 1.), is one of the finest in M.L.
A long-distance medical record was put
up by Dr. William Henry Semple, who has
just answered the bell. He was 85. and
had looked after the health of the residents
of Ivilmore (Vic.) for 56 years. Prior to
that he was for three years resident sur-
geon at Melbourne Hospital. Even after his
retirement —he was then over 80 —the kindly
old man was prepared on occasion to give
free medical advice to those who needed it.
“Te W.”: The early curators of the
Sydney Botanical Gardens had troubles of
their own. When Alan Cunningham, whose
monument stands in a pool in the Gardens,
was boss ( circa 1840), he complained that
the wives of the Government officials used the
place as a sort of kitchen garden, and relied
on it and him for their supply of turnips and
cabbages. Cunningham grew so disgusted
at the inroads of official people who daily
carried away baskets of vegetables, fruit and
pot-herbs that he resigned.
“Cousin Jack” : “Cwrw Bach,” who credits
the old A.I.F. jacket with 13 buttons (B.
2/'lO/’24), must have been unobservant. As
a Q.M. I’ve issued hundreds, besides wearing
several while dealing at close range with
Jaeko. There were five buttons down the
front of the jacket, two on shoulder straps,
four on pockets, two on cuffs, and one on the
cloth belt —this last to keep the metal buckle
in place. So as there never was any super-
stition about the number 14, the Aussie sol-
dier was quite right not to worry about the
number of his buttons.
“Capta”: “Cartot” questions the antiquity
of the coins we dug up in France (B.
11/9/’24). In reply let me say that in
Robert Philps’s “Progress of Great Britain”
(London, 1859) is an illustration of a coin
issued by the early British Queen Boadicea.
On one side is a horse —the same horse as
on the coins we found—while the reverse
bears the word “Bodvo”; that of our
coins showed a wild boar. Since the Viking
is ruled out as a minter of coin, it would
seem as if these were early British. Cer-
tainly they were not trouser-buttons.
“P. Pinktape” : A cynical reflection upon
matrimony was supplied in the excuse of
a Melbourne registry office to the angry com-
plaint of a scrupulously respectable squatter.
He had applied for a married couple cap-
able of doing all the things expected of
m.c.’s on squattages, and his indignation
arose from the fact that the pair supplied
were without their marriage lines, although
explicit instructions had been given to make
sure of their conjugal status. “I took it
for granted they were married,” the registry
manager replied. “They had a stand-up
fight in the office.”
“Machete”: Another casual Australian
lounged into the Divorce Court the other day
to ask for a decree on the grounds of deser-
tion. Pressed for details, John Blank said
he had been wedded 16 years ago, and had
gone to work at Temora, intending to visit
his bride at ’Coota for the week-ends. When
he strolled up for the second instalment of
domestic bliss he found the coop empty and
the bird gone. Some five years elapsed be-
fore John heard anything more from Mrs.
John ; then came, by letter, a request for some
cash, which he ignored. Later, remarked
the petitioner, he had heard his wife was
living at Waterloo, but he hadn’t bothered
to look her up or even confirm the rumor.
Owen, J., made some remarks on the casual
atmosphere, but granted the decree.
“Harold Hardupp”: According to the Agf.
a member of the Congregational Union testi-
fied that after praying about it, a lost pony
had been found; and, on another occasion,
having forgotten his wife’s washing-day re-
quest to ring up about a load of wood, he
made the omission a subject of prayer, and
found a load within 20 yards of his front
gate.
My lot is little for my needs,
And troubles on my doormat brew.
My grocer for his money pleads,
Then rages, threatening to sue.
But how my prayers rise up we foam,
And I have hopes about the Cup,
For Heav’n may send my pony home,
And fix the grocer’s troubles up.
“Algebra” : The advice to young philatelists
to tqrn out grandfather’s old trunk reminds
me that my young brother recently obtained
from a benevolent old lady two Queensland
stamps, seemingly identical, showing the full
face of young Queen Victoria, and marked
at a penny. He has since learned that one
is worth Is. 6d., and the other, owing to a
difference in the water-mark, £8 —at least,
that’s what you have to pay for them. A
friend of mine has in his possession seven
thousand penny stamps collected in England
bv his father soon after the introduction of
Penny Postage. They are now catalogued
at from 4d. to Is. 6d. apiece, though what
you could get for them if you wanted to sell
them mav be a different matter. A stamp
which is liable to disappoint young collectors
is the Sydney Jubilee issue, with a viev
of Sydney often mistaken for a ver- T early
and valuable N.S.W. stamp, known as a
“Sydney View” ; two of the latter recently
brought SOOs. in a London auction. Even
postcard albums with no pretensions to
antiquity are worth prospecting, seeing that
one of the first issues of our present design
of Commonwealth penny stamps is already
catalogued at 4s. 6d. to 6s. 6d. And a six-
penny poster-design stamp showing a kooka-
burra, issued less than ten ago, is
mark-d at 3s. 6d. to 6s. 6d.

When the aged patriarch of the Batak
tribe of Sumatra grows tired of govern-
mental cares he climbs a tree in the season ot
ripe lemons and hangs on by his lianas
while his relations dance beneath. \\ lien lie
falls he is knocked on the head and eaten,
thus being assured of practical immortality
and of a continued existence without strain-
ing the goodwill of the clan. The tragedy
of King Lear, who is the example of all
parents, was that he relied on the goodwill
of the younger generation without retaining
in his own hands any means of enforcing
it. Being busy with their own evolution,
they found the exacting old man merely an
obstruction, and took steps, somewhat too
drastic for this modern age of sentimental
illusion, to remove him.
* * * *
Allan Wilkie has done nothing finer than
his presentation, at Sydney Palace, of the
doting old fellow who divides his kingdom
between his two dynamic and ambitious
daughters and curses the only daughter with
a sufficiently passive temperament to be
ready to devote her young life to looking
after him. His rapid progress through dis-
illusioned fury in his daughters’ courts to
madness in the midst of the storm, with two
other madmen to accompany him, until he
regains an expiring peace in the constancy
of Cordelia, was a piece of finely-sustained
acting, witli moments in it of almost in-
tolerable pathos. Plumpton Wilson, as the
faithful but bitter jester, whose cynical
railing at the folly of his master should
show up like lightning against the night of
Lear’s deluded mind, was not equal to his
part. Miss Hunter-Watts, dressed chastely
in white, made an effective and tender con-
trast to her brutal sisters, Irene Webb and
Kiore King; while Claude Saunders, as the
bastard son of Gloucester, contradicted his
vicious eyebrows with a pair of innocent-
looking legs clad in the skins of Australian
bunnies.

That Sydney can sustain only one night
of such a performance, while it can tolerate
American highball “drammer” and snob
comedy apparently for ever, is a sorry com-
mentary on the million city’s taste and
moral fibre.
Shakspeare should be deeply indebted to
Allan Wilkie for making the best of an
extremely poor play on Saturday night at
Sydney Palace. “Cymbeline,” last seen in
Sydney 37 years ago, bears all the marks of
AT SYDNEY TIVOLI.
Bert Levy, artist-entertainer.
having been hastily knocked together to keep
the bailiff from the door or pay the interest
on the mortgage. If an Australian play-
wright inflicted so ill-constructed a piece
on. the, public, every, honest and competent
critic in the metropolis would gleefully rend
him to pieces; the sacred Bard, whom we all
worship but don’t go to see, being the author
of the thing, each newspaper will duly burn
10 sticks of conventional incense to it and
pass on to half a column of adoration of the
latest musical comedy. There are indications
that Shakspeare intended his sticky romance
to be a tragedy, in which the poison-purvey-
ing queen and the king who gives the title
to the piece would play a sanguinary part;
but, if so, after decapitating one character
and killing another with despair, he got tired
of the idea and, after browsing through some
25 disconnected scenes, cantered safely home
to a happy ending. Nevertheless, the play
contains some lucid intervals and two per-
fect lyrics, and the Wilkie co.’s fine presenta-
tion of it held the attention of the audience
to the end. Allan Wilkie as Posthumus
allowed himself to be very easily satisfied
of his wife’s unchastity ; and Miss Hunter-
Watts, as the maligned lady, bore up with
unusual patience under the accusation.
Claude Saunders, as lachimo, the too-optimis-
tic young man who believes every woman
has her price, acted with traditional exag-
geration ; and Hamilton Henry played the
fool commendably.
“The Cousin from Nowhere” continues the
most mirthful of vagabonds at Sydney Royal,
and the Tulip Dance suggests that the lyri-
cal possibilities of the Dutch flower have
been overlooked by poets with horticultural
tastes.
At Sydney Majesty’s “Whirled into Happi-
ness” pursues the mad merry-go-rounding of
its way with all the joyous abandon expected
of it.
“East of Suez” will flood the stage of Syd-
ney Cri. on Saturday night with Oriental
atmosphere, Chinese music, intrigue, love,
mystery and the rest of it, as com-
pounded by Somerset Maugham and served
by Muriel Starr, Frank Harvey and the
rest of them.
“The O’Brien Girl” will sparkle for only
three more nights at Sydney Opera House.
For a week the house will be in the cleaners’
hands; then, on the 15th, Seymour Hicks
will come in with “Broadway Jones.”
Bert Devy has brought his lightning
sketches and lmmorous patter to the Sydney
Tivoli. Sitting at the side of a large lan-
tern he does his drawings on a lampblacked
lens, the result, enormously magnified, being
thrown on a sheet at the back of him. He has
a genuine liking for the Aussie in the knicker-
bockered stage, and his stay in Sydney
promises to be as entertaining for the young-
sters as for their elders. Alice Lloyd is a
piquant comedienne who is a cross between
sister Marie and Ada Reeve. Her songs
are of the robust type, sprinkled with spice:
for instance, her injunction to the girls to
be a little unconventional but strictly respect-
able. The J.C.W. Jazz Band consists of
seven young men who, if the noises they make
are any guide, should be in rompers still.
Fred Macdonald, who has been Dave, of
“On Our Selection,” so often that he hardly
knows which of the two he really is, has
now adopted him for a series of sketches at
Fullers’ Theatre, Sydney. But in “The
Honeymoon” Macdonald’s Dave isn’t the Dave
The Bulletin knows. Our Dave was a little
rough and ready in his manners, but he was
never guilty of some of the indelicacies that
Macdonald puts in his mouth. Stiffy and
Mo, with a keen eye on topical events, have
now turned themselves into wharfies. But
they will soon be in trouble —they will work
after dark.
Their production of Zangwill’s “Melting
Pot” has placed the Players in the first
ranks of Sydney amateurs. In Walter Hunt,
their producer, they are fortunate —his act-
ing as the hero, David Quixano, was a
notable piece of work; and he has that rare
thing, a beautiful speaking voice. Mrs.
Balter as David’s grandmother, Francis
Jackson as the erratic genius’s uncle, and
Edward Beeby as the old musician were
other successes. The girls were not so good
as the men. They sounded strained and arti-
ficial. But Mollie Kirwan, toned down,
should make an Excellent low-comedy actress
later on.
❖ * *
Guy Bates Post is the hero of “Gold Mad-
ness.” This sample of yellow fever, on
exhibit at Sydney Lyceum, proves on exami-
nation to have much in common with pre-
■ ions outbreaks. At the same big house
Baby Peggy, as the foster-daughter of a
weatherbeaten old salt, is the recipient of
bushels of tender pity from sentimental
aunties. At Hoyt’s a married man and a
girl burlesque a spoony scene from the
Immortal Bard, and presently this makes an
important piece of evidence in a divorce
action. The co-re. is “The Perfect Flapper,”
and looks it, down to her Louis-heeled shoes.
The Lyric pleads “It Is the Law” as an
excuse for sending a just-married man to a
job picking oakum; and “Gambling Wives,”
at the Strand, will make husbands chary of the
woman who has so much even as an annual
bob-in on the Melbourne Cup. “Peter the
Great” is haunting the Crystal Palace; four
times a day the audience holds its breath
while he crawls feebly to Catherine’s room
and finds her with his Prime Minister.
Rodolph Valentino is bull-fighting at the
Globe, and the Empress is revealing “The
Rev. Dell’s Secret.”
Although previously the public support
given to the William Heughan concerts has
been a great deal less than they deserved, his
fiual appearance last Friday at the Mel-
bourne Town Hall drew a largish audience
which brought a great enthusiasm with it.
There was a strong demand for the repeti-
tion of numbers previously sung, and
At Sydney Tivoli.
Rich Hayes, the lazy
juggler.
Heughan showed
his dramatic artis-
try, verve and good
voice as well as at
any time since his
arrival. Besides his
regular assistants,
he had the help of
Lilian Tether,
violinist; Gladys
Sayer, whose work
at the piano was
delightful; and
Heather Belle,
who provided Scot-
tish dances. The
Melbourne Pipe
and Drum Band
added some weird
! loud noises—alto-
gether too loud for
any but the hard-
ened Scottish ear.
Heughan lias now
moved on to
Sydney.
Appreciative audi-
ences have been at-
tending Melbourne
King’s to see what
“Aren’t We All?”
is about; and ex-
cellent dialogue and
a cast that exhibits
few weaknesses re-
pay them with a fine entertainment.
The Starr of much affliction set last night
(Wednesday) at the Melbourne Royal,
where J. D. O’Hara is to open on Saturday
in “Ivempy.” Muriel’s season in Melbourne
has been a popular success, the lady who
in various parts expresses a desire to be
’appy while she goes the wrongheaded way
to misery being a strong favorite with women
—they know it is the sex’s privilege to be-
have like that. In the closing piece, “The
Silent Witness,” a good bit of work other
than that already mentioned was done by
the useful Frank Hawthorne as the vindic-
tive Mr. Weldon.
The prolonged run of “The Rise of Rosie
O’Reilly” is giving the New Princess’s, in
Melbourne, cause for a pride which is duty
flaunted in the advertisements; and the in-
cursion of large Cup crowds lias furnished
new use for the “House Full” signs, which
have been kept very busy.
“Old Bill, M.r.,” is still re-elected every
night at the Melbourne New Palace.
Two more Melbourne shows:—
A wholly delectable art is that of Berenice Edwell,
whose miniatures and paintings on ivory are being
given a brief exhibition at the Decoration Galleries.
Three small landscapes are excellent in tone and
substance, but are .a minor part of the display.
The artist’s portrait of her mother, a delightful ren-
dering of a delightful subject, shows special quality.
“Rosita” is a delicate study so exquisitely balanced
that even the folded hands suggest the animation
which is to be found in the face. In “From Spain’’
the tonal treatment is fine; the work upon the
embroidered veil, with the shadows of the darker
clothes and the flesh tints of the arm showing through,
holds the eye. And “Michael and Julian, Sons of
Captain and the Hon. Mrs. Pitt Rivers,” is another
good bit of work. In “1924” the verve and inde-
pendence of the modern flapper is splendidly sug-
gested—in fact, the whole 26 items grip.
The rather overcrowded show of F. Latimer and
H. Sennett, at the Athenaeum Hall, illustrates the
progress of both artists: some of the items were done
before much progress was made. There is a meretri-
cious effect in most of the night studies towards
which Latimer inclines; but “Lanky—a Coranderrk
Identity,” is a surprisingly good abo. portrait. His
offering descends from this to a horrible back-view
portrait of “Fallen Giants” —merely a smudge show-
ing the roots of two trees. Scnnett’s lot recalls early-
Victorian ideas of art, and suggests a desire to paint
trees without surrounding atmosphere. But “A
Winter’s Garden” is truthful, full of freshness, and
“Sunlight After Rain, Armentieres, 1916,” also has
fidelity of treatment.
Andrew Higginson, who built an Austra-
lian reputation on one bright success, is
making a vaudeville appearance at Mel-
bourne Tivoli. With the assistance of Enid
Laviose, he runs through a passable act with
no features of distinction; his “The Night I
Appeared as Macbeth” doesn’t bear compari-
son with the work of a previous vaudevillain
in the same item. With the rest of the
programme Tivoli regulars arc familiar —
anyway, if they have not seen them at the
Tivoli they have at the Royal, which has now
changed its ways.
An un programmed sensation occurred at
Wirths’ one day last week when the assist-
ant of Paul de Boult in aerial dare-devilry
lost his hold on the trapese and crashed into*
the cii-cus ring, fortunately with less serious
effects than seemed likely. But a circus
crowd is a useful crowd, and there is no gap
left in the entertainment at Olympia, where
an old favorite, the trick riding-pony
Earl Dudley, lias come back to the ring to
take a sagacious pleasure in the public
applause.
The programme of Hoyt’s Melbourne
house varies between the adventures of
Connie Talmadge as a quick-change
matrimonial artist in “Goldfish” and an
invasion of New York by Hoot Gib-
son and other cowboys in “Broad-
way or Bust.” The Majestic screens a
laugh-producer in “Listen Lester” and a
dramatic New Mexico story in “Cold Steel”;
and the crowds that kept their money by
staying away from the big races have been
given a fleeting glimpse of the running of
the chief events in most of the picture-
theatres. Another interesting and welcome
outbreak in the picture world is the appear-
ance of Vera Bedford in songs at the Audi-
torium ; and Kitty Reidy is still drifting
around the Hoyt circuit —to which, by the
way, was recently added a fine theatre at
Ivanlioe, capable of holding 2000 people.
The brief season of variety at Adelaide
Royal ended with a week of Albert Whelan,
his quiet but effective self, as of old, even to
the business with coat and gloves. But the
biggest enthusiasm goes to the Americans,
Pierce and Miss Rosslyn, big every way, in
figure, voice, smile and the instruments they
play on ; audiences don’t like to let them go.
Eve Lynn is dainty, and Marcel is a clever
skater whose patter needs disinfecting. At
the Majestic are some bright Japs, the 11
clever Wonder Children, and George Wallace
and co. in an extravagant “revue.” Wonder-
graph has Williamson’s photo of the sea-
bottom and its inhabitants, fascinating and
genuine. Louise Lovely in person conducts
studio sessions at West’s, where all kinds of
aspirants get a chance for screen fame. The
York supplements a good programme with
some local singers who scored at Ballarat.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : My pet lachrymose ditty,
which I allow to run about the house some-
times for the delectation of visitors, describes
how a lady balladist is insulted by the
advances of some amorous snobs, an event
which brings a remonstrance from an honest
workin’ man. The remonstrance is of course
the chorus; and, as delivered with verve
by the imported Artist whose “rendition” I
heard, it ran :
She’s a sing-ah, but a lydy, jest the sime ;
Sale’s a my ding fit ter gryce the fairest nime,
Yew ’ave sistahs deah to yew—she’s somebody’s
sistah, too;
She’s a singah, but a lydy, jest ther sime!
The first time I heard it, a lady in the gal-
lery was so overcome with emotion that she
nearly swallowed the orange she was sucking.

OBJECTS.
The Syndicate, having already acquired 100 acres of Mineral Leases, situated at Yemelba, in close
proximity to the South Alligator River, and Mundogie Hill, on a new goldfield discovered by George Laurie,
prospector, also 80 acres of Silver-lead Mineral Leases, situated at Boomlura, which is three-quarters of
a mile west of the 131-mile peg on the Darwin-Emungalan Railway, it is proposed to inspect, report on,
and, if found payable, work the above mines, by forming a company with sufficient capital to erect treat-
ment plants on the respective mines. Also to inspect, and report on, a Tin-dredging Area on the Collia
Tinfield, which has already been taken up.
Reports cn these propositions bv Mr. George Laurie are available from the Brokers.
ALLIGATOR RIVER MINES. —By the report it will be seen that samples taken in close proximity to
two massive outcrops, from an outcrop on a high ridge on the main divide of the auriferous belt, where
a small shaft five feet deep has been suntc, taken from a lode four feet wide, assay for the! first two
feet loz. 19dwt., and the bottom two feet 7ioz. of gold.
Bulk samples taken from about three tons of ore scattered around this shaft assay for 71 oz. and
lOoz. of gold per ton.
Work has been commenced on this area, which Mr. Laurie considers the pick of this new goldfield,
and a bulk parcel of about five tons of ore will be mined, bagged and carted to the railway at Pine
Creek, as a test of bulk values.
This parcel, Mr. Laurie estimates, will return between £3O and £4O per ton, and the cost of
obtaining’ and delivering it at the railway will not exceed £lOO. He also estimates that with freight
charges and other facilities adjusted, the total cost per ton to extract the gold values will nit exceed
£4 per ton by shipping to the smelters, and that the total cost of landing at the railway of a parcel of
ore worth £2OO will be £lOO.
The ore from this field, Mr. Laurie states, will respond to treatment by amalgamation, concentration,
and a percentage of free gold can be obtained.
FLORA BELLE SILVER LEAD MINES. —These mines were worked in the early days, when silver
was 2s. per ounce, and the main shaft sunk to a depth of 210 feet.
From official returns obtained from the Warden’s office, bulk parcels of ore sent from this mine to
the smelters returned 75 per cent, lead and up to 1200 oz. of silver per ton, and a consignment of
99 tin; sent to Port Adelaide realised a NETT PROFIT of £727/5/6, and 34 tons a nett profit of
£192/14/2.
Unfortunately, heavy water was struck, and the mine closed down, and although held to within
very recent date, was not re-opened.
COLLIA TINFIELD. —Mr. Laurie estimates that 10 miles of channels and flats carry 5,000,000 cubic
yards of drift, averaging 21b. of tin oxide per cubic yard.
IN CONCLUSION. —It is proposed to send out an expert to report on all the above properties in
October, and his report should be available before the end of the year.
Full particulars and copies of Mr. Laurie's reports on the above areas, with prospectus,
can be obtained from Arthur LI. Clarke, Mining Agent, Cairns, the Broker to tlie
Syndicate.

“Caesar’s Ghost”: There has been a
rumpus over the bill for £1296 which the
J. C. Williamson firm rendered to the com-
mittee in charge of Melba’s appeal for the
limbless soldiers. It is explained that the
committee knew all about the need for meet-
ing certain expenses, and actually arranged
to meet them. But the public, which sup-
ported the appeal, didn’t know'; its impres-
sion vas that the Firm would be content
with the credit that would naturally accrue
to it from its share in the proceedings.
Portion of the bill is reasonable enough—
the souvenir programmes, for instance,
amply paid for themselves; but the charge
of £5OO for one night’s “loss of business”
when “The Lady of the Rose,” not a start-
ling financial success, was taken off, is
rather amazing. And there is another point
about which some curiosity has been shown.
At the conclusion of the gala night a cheque
supposed to be for the full amount to the
credit of the fund w r as dramatically handed
to Melba, wdio as dramatically handed it
hack to be passed on to the right quarter.
If the committee knew of expenses still to
he met, this was obviously only a stage
gesture, and not a particularly felicitous
one in the circumstances.
“F.L.11.”: The memorable recital in which
the Melbourne pianiste Nellie Billings figured
a few weeks ago with Percy Grainger was
destined to be her last. For 20 years she
had been in the front rank of Victorian musi-
cians as soloist, accompanist to visiting-
artists, and in chamber music, in which she
was notably associated with violinist Ernest
Toy; and a shoal of pupils will gratefully
remember her ten years’ work at the Albert-
street Conservatorium. And there are others
who will remember her with gratitude: in
1016 she spent some months in Egypt, and
many a war-tired soldier had his nerves
soothed by her melodies.
“Adelaide”: Albert Whelan, coming to
Adelaide on professional business, has re-
lived in the local papers the story of his
impersonating Oscar Girard in “The Belle
of New' York.” as lately told by me, and
i ndorsed by him, in The Bulletin. Ernest
Wliitingtori of the Register adds in his
paper some interesting details from the point
of view of the tw'o daily-paper critics of
that era (July, 1839) :
I should like, as one of the clitics —the other ivas
the late W. J. Evans—-to say that we were tricked
not by the impersonation, but by the representatives
of the Firm. Gordon Simpson, an Adelaide lawyer,
came to me and said he had just returned from Mel-
bourne, and the man appearing as Bronson ivas not
Girard. Billy Evans straightway questioned one of
the representatives of the Firm; he came back and
said: “Simpson is wrong. Pete Hughes absolutely
laughs at the idea of it not being Girard.” On
Sunday Joe St. Clair, Dick Stewart and Pete Hughes
all assured me positively that it was Girard that had
appeared. Early in the week I accidentally met
Hetty Muret, one of the company, and she said
“You might have given Albert Whelan the credit.”
Evans was very wroth. He wrote an indignant
letter to J. C. Williamson, who replied that he did
not approve of such tactics, and was very sorry for
what had occurred, adding: “I always think it pays
to take the press into one s confidence.”
“Wodgil”: The opinion of “S. Gumm’s”
friends that “This Freedom” is the finest
film seen in Australia for years (B.
30/10/’24) is evidently shared by Professor
Wallace, the chief censor. Speaking in Mel-
bourne the other day the Prof, said thiit
British films were quite as good as the Ameri-
can productions; “in fact, the best film I
have seen during the last two years was
British.” “Unfortunately,” he added, “it
wasn’t shown in Melbourne.” llow signi-
ficant !
“N’lmporte”: The piracy in the vaude-
ville profession (B. 23/10/’24) is, of course,
notorious. But it is also rife in the higher
branches of entertainment, as every travelled
theatregoer knows. Australia is the most
non-inventive county on the face of the earth
as far as the amusement business is con-
cerned. Our plays are all imported, and
with them come a swarm of actors.and stage-
directors. The idea is that it is impossible
to put on any piece here unless the stage-
manager aqd most of the actors have seen
if beforehand and taken notes of the gags
and pet pieces of “business” invented by the
originators of the parts. Nearly all our
motion-pictures are from the U.S.A. If one
by accident is made in this country, ten to
one it follows the bad American methods
in every particular. No Australian musician
is reckoned export enough to interpret jazz
or capable of conducting syncopated nigger
melodies, so once more we import Americans
at great expense to deafen us with the real
thing. Audiences prefer the importations, so
the patriotic proprietors assert, and they
ought to know.
“Charlik”: References to present-day
actors’ salaries (B. 30/10/’24) are pleasant
reading to an old-timer who recalls the
meagre payments made in the past. The
late George Lauri never got anywhere near
£5O per week. As a member of the old Royal
Comics, he received £25. He asked for an-
other fiver, and J. C. Williamson raised him
£2 10s. Years after George got more, but
never £5O. In the Royal Comics, and after-
wards in the Gilbert and Sullivan co., the
salaries paid to Australian performers were,
even in those days, absurdly small. An
actress who, although a soprano, gave the
finest performance of Katislm seen on the
Australian (or, in my experience, any other)
si age received a salary which I will not
insult the lady by mentioning. It is good
to know that native-born artists are at last
receiving adequate recognition.
“Abbot P.” : “To Po’s” reference to Louise
Pomeroy (B. 23/10/’24) recalls her first
appearance in Melbourne. “Romeo and
Juliet” was the play, and possibly the gal-
lery would have appreciated its beauties if
Ned Kelly hadn’t been hanged a few days
before. When Friar Lawrence took the
stage there was a terrific uproar, the gods
imagining a resemblance between the actor
who impersonated that blameless character
and Upjohn, the public executioner. Fierce
A PROMISING OUTLOOK.
“No, I don’t think I can employ you regu-
larly. But I might find you some odd
jobs.”
“That’s the sort, sir. The odder the hetter
sir.”
yells of “Upjohn” and furious expletives
drowned the delivery of the Bard’s blank
verse. Poor Louise was dreadfully upset,
but there was no stilling the tumult while
“Upjohn” was on the boards. It would
have been unsafe even to attempt it, for
“Upjolin’s” critics were a tough lot.
“Hamfaf” : Mario Majeroni (B. 23/10’24)
once ventured into management in conjunc-
tion with Charlie McMahon. For a time
the partners did well, but Mario’s partiality
for racing and his faculty for picking the
wrong horses dissipated his share of the
profits. I have known him to lose a thou-
sand pounds at one Christchurch (M.L.)
meeting. That was an unlucky tour for the
young man, inasmuch as his mother, the
Signora, died while the co. was at Auckland,
and, incidentally, the Auckland season was
a black frost. The Majeronis never did
any good after that in Australasia; but in
America they dropped into some decent jobs.
“Peter Pan”: Strange how the custom of
using Latin words in stage directions per-
sists. The “dramatis persona” is still told
to “exit” instead of “go off,” and not yet
has “omnes” been abandoned in favor of
“all” when the personae speak in unison.
I once heard an assistant stage-manager,
new to the game, announce, “Omnes speaks
GIVING A TRADE SECRET AWAY.
“Father, what is a gag?"
“A gag, my hoy, is something that is put
into a man’s mouth to prevent him from
talking.”
“And would a gag prevent a man from
laughing?”
“Er — yes, of course. Why?”
“Oh, now I understand why you call your
jokes gags, father.”
next; who is playing him?” And there was
a rehearsal of the forum scene in a Wilkie
production of “Julius Caesar,” at which Pat
Scully, the veteran s.-m., was reduced to
a stunned silence as a result of ringing in
the word. Pat had instructed a bewildered
lot of supers as to the shields and standards
they were to bring on at their first entrance,
and the spears and cheers they were to pro-
duce when they meandered on again; “and
then,” he proceeded, “you exit 0.p., and
there are a lot of omnes there for you.”
“And do we bring them on at our next
entrance?” inquired the leader, a conscien-
tious youth.
“Nikko”: M.L.’s Premier Massey has
reached the pinnacle of fame. His effigy
now stands among the celebrities in Madame
Tussaud’s Waxworks.
“Lud”: Bernard Shaw, though he is a
great stickler for the “words” —he insists on
the actors speaking every line of his dialogue
—apparently does not object to whole acts
being cut out of his pieces. “Man and Super-
man,” so far as I know, has never been
played in its entirety, and now comes the
news that the first and fifth acts (G.B.S.
calls them “parts”) of his “Back to Methu-
selah” are being served up daily at the
London Court Theatre, where Pshaw had
his big innings in the Granville Barker days.
Any man who writes a five-act play three
acts of which are proved to be unnecessary
must be a genius.
A little theatrical war:—
There was a recent mention in the cables of
Alice Pollard, “the Maoriland musical-comedy star,”
and perhaps Daphne Pollard, who is a bright light
in vaudeville and revue, was meant. Anyway, it
reminded me of the days when; Alice Pollard and I
were battling to keep afloat the theatrical barge of
B. and F. Wheeler in Johannesburg and the multi-
tudinous “fonteins” of S’Africa, nearly two decades
ago. Alice, daughter of Tom of honored memory,
was then a slender, vivacious, ginger-haired streak
of versatility whom everybody liked. George Smith,
an Australian, was a partner in B. and F. Wheeler,
but, after a series of financial failures, which include.d
Johnny Sheridan’s co. and the Royal Australians
(Pollard’s original outfit, in which were Percy,
Harry Qfiealy, Alf Stephens,, Dave O’Connor, Gertie
Campion, Alice’ Edgar, Nellie Wilson and Alice her-
self), the partnership came to an end. Smith went
to England and secured the S’African rights of all
the Gaiety and Daly’s productions. Frank Wheeler
got wind of the deal and snapped up every available
theatre in all the centres. In effect, he had the
playhouses, while Smith had the plays. Wheeler did
his best with a few stock dramatic shows, and with
a musical comedy turn-out which had Alice, Lottie
Sergeant, Gertrude Parker, Sylvia May, Frank Greene,
Bertie Walton, Theo Leonard and Sydney Mannering
as its mainstays. Harry Burton conducted the
band and the rehearsals, and we struggled along for
several months on two awful Seymour Hicks pro-
ductions, “Tiie Catch of the Season” and “l'lie
Beauty of Bath,” together with “The White Chry-
santhemum,” “The Dairymaids,” The Blue Moon,”
and a few resurrections, such as “The Orchid” and
“The Shop Girl.” Our last effort was in panto-
mime, when Billy Hassan paralysed the Dutcnmen
by his life-like donkey antics in “The Forty Thieves.”
Then the edict went forth that the Smith-Wheeler
fight had been won. A London company came out,
under Wheeler’s direction, with “The Merry Widow”
and “The Girls of Gottenburg.” But unfortunately
there was a dead horse in the shape of £20,000
for unpaid rent of theatres. When last I heard of
Frank Wheeler (he was the original London Migglcs
in “The Shop Girl”) he was running a duck-farm in
Kent. The last I saw of Smith was on the
railway station at Inverkegville (M.L.), one bitterly
cold morning. He was holding a pair of Oscar
Asche’s greyhounds.
“Pantagruel”: The incidental music at
our Yeppoon (C.Q.) pitcher-theatre is mostly
provided by a young pianist with an exten-
sive repertory. He is a fanciful youth, and
the chuncs he fits to the scenes flashed on
the sheet are often humorously appropriate.
I have heard him greet a fist-fight with “Our
Hands Have Met, but Not Our Hearts ;
the closed peepers of the loser with “Your
Eyes Have Told Me All”; a Bolshevik with
“Sink. Red Sun”; a burglar leaving the job
with “I Passed by Your Window When
No One Was Nigh” ; a comedian getting a
crack on the head with “O Star of Eve ;
and a drunk lurching home with ‘ There s
Somebody Waiting for Me.” In these days
of dull pitchers a key-thumper who can work
in a bit of comedy is a treasure. But I
wouldn't recommend the example of the
Westralian pianist who tried to brighten a
picture of a royal funeral —the deceased being
a dame belonging to one of the Continental
houses —by striking up “Good-bye, Little
Girl, Good-bye.”
“Morris” : Regarding the idiosyncrasies of
stage soldiers (B. 11/10/’24), what about
that captain of the Buckingham Palaoe
guard in “Old Bill, M.P.,” who faces las
men when giving the order for the royal
salute? And when the Palace gates are
thrown open, and the hand of the Cold-
streams moves back to barracks, the officers
of the guard desert their posts in order to
march with drawn swords at its head. It
may look stunning, but it simply isn’t done.
“Abbot P.”: These two-piano recitals have
been referred to as quite a recent innovation.
But I can remember Henri KowaMd taking
part in a performance of his “Hungarian
March” arranged for eight pianos. The other
executants ' were Miss Charbonuet-Kcller-
maun, Alberto Zelman, Julius Hcrz, Otto
Vogt and three petticoated amateurs; and
that is nearly 40 years ago.
“Centurion” : “To Po’s” story of his voci-
ferous wayback friend (B. 23/10/’24) who
audibly commented on the actors at Mel-
bourne Royal recalls a similar experience at
what was then the Opera House in Brisbane.
My friend had once held a commission in
the old regular army. He had done himself
very well at dinner, and Bland Holt’s pro-
duction of “The Union Jack” did not please
him. lie early fell out with the villain, who
impersonated a military officer, because he
wore the wrong sort of boots. It became the
villain’s duty to march a squad of men on to
the stage and down to the footlights, and
these halted as one man in obedience to a
stentorian order from my friend in the front
stalls. There was a horrible silence for a
few seconds, while the villain, Albert Nor-
inan, did some swift thinking, staring mur-
derously at his critic the while. Before he
could recover his troops received the com-
mand to about turn and march on till they
reached the river and drowned their crimson
selves. The ushers began to arrive about
that time, and we rather lost the thread of
the play from then on.
“Machete”: “8.8.’5” reference to “vola-
tile” Alice Leamar (B. 30/10/’24) is a re-
minder that the one-time darling of the Lon-
don ’alls could turn on the lugubrious tap
when she thought the occasion opportune.
At least one song of her repertory was quali-
fied to start in the Tearful Stakes which
recent “Point” correspondents have been dis-
cussing. It was called “Living Pictures,”
and in it, clad as a stage gamin, Alice told us
of the sorrows attendant on poverty, virtuous
and otherwise. She rather spoilt the effect,
for the epicure, by sandwiching it in be-
tween “Always Take Your Opera-glass,” a
distinctly “French” lyric as interpreted by
Alice, and “Lookin’ for a Coon Like Me.”
which also carried an appeal to the sinful;
but one of the refrains still lingers:—
It’s ’aid, yer see, fer blokes like me
Wot’s troubles to enjure.
There ain’t no marble ’alls within
Ther ’ovels of ther pore.
Me little sister took ther step,
An’ died in reckless shime;
A pretty livin’ pitcher—Yus—
But wivout ther gilded frime.
MOVIE TITLES.
[FOR THE BULLETINs.]
“The gullible Babes in Hollywood are flim-flammed
almost daily by nun and women who claim foreign
titles. So’ serious has the situation become that
producers are aiming their publicity directors with
copies of ‘Burke’s Peerage.’ ”
There’s Lady This and there’s Countess That,
And many another aristocrat
W ant movie jobs, with their salaries fat,
From the Yankee Hollywood democrat.
The Yank lie looks a trifle bored.
It’s only . his business instincts stored.
Saya he: “1 guess I ken’t afford
Your terms!” But, oh, how he loves a Lord 1
And a title on his posters means
A draw| in his “real old English scenes,”'
So Lady Bluff Broke soon has means
In the gullible land of pork and beans.
But the game has “gotten” a trifle hot;
The movie men have been spoofed a lot;
For often the titled folks have not
More claim on “Burke” than a Hottentot.
And the film producers, much upset
At paying for something they don’t get,
Are referring nowadays to Debrett
And such-like lists. So nnv, you bet,
Only Dooks and Earls of an ancient line
Will get the chame to contracts sign;
For titles the Hollywood democrats pine;
But, gee! they must have ’em genoo-ine.

Equipment Regulates Results
THE leaders in the mining industry are known by the
kind of equipment they use. In this industry, as in
most others, the user of electrical equipment is the
leader, because he finds that he can do better work more
economically.
The Westinghouse Electric Locomotive is one example
of the improvement in operating conditions which may
be obtained by discarding old-fashioned methods and
adopting modern machinery equipped with de-
pendable electrical apparatus.

OBJECTS.— (1) To take over from Australian Piers, Limited, all its right, title
and interest and all its obligations under an indenture of lease and an agreement entered
into with it on 14th July, 1924, by the Council of the Municipality of Randwick.
(2) To erect an Ocean Promenade Pier with Theatre, Ballroom and Concert Hall,
Stalls, Restaurant, etc.
(3) To carry into effect, agreements with Australian Piers, Limited, and G. L. D.
James, drafts of which have been identified by W. J. Creagli, Solicitor.
(4) To repay to Australian Piers, Limited, the sum of £lOOO deposited by it with
the Council of the Municipality of Randwick as a guarantee of good faith.
THE LEASE AND AGREEMENT.—These documents can be seen at the office of
the Company. The main points of the lease are:—
(a) Period to be 28 years, the lessee having the option of whatever renewal is
granted to the Council by the Crown.
(ft) Rent during construction to be £lO per annum and after completion £540 per
annum.
PROXIMITY TO THE CITY. —Coogee is the natural and inevitable Mecca of a
vast body of pleasure-seekers, being most centrally situated both with regard to the City
and the southern and eastern suburbs, and being exceedingly well served by Tram and
Motor-’Bus services. This pre-eminent and ever-increasing popularity is convincingly
demonstrated by the Tramway Traffic figures, which show 261 million people carried by
the Coogee line in the 12 months ending Sist May, 1924.
THE COOGEE OCEAN PIER.—The Pier will he an imposing Promenade extend-
ing out over Coogee Bay for 900 feet. New and fascinating views, shoreward and
seaward, will meet the eye at every step, and, though situated above the waters of the
I!ay, it will provide every facility for the convenience, comfort and entertainment, of a
very large number of pleasure-seekers simultaneously. The principal attractions will be:
(a) An up-to-date Theatre —not merely a Pavilion—with seating for 1400 people
and full stage.
(ft) A spacious Restaurant seating 400 people.
(c) A special Band Rotunda half-way down the Promenade.
( d ) A large Ballroom, where 300 couples can dance and 200 look on from a com-
fortable balcony, and which can also be used as a concert hall seating 1000
people.
(e) Perfectly-appointed Cloak-rooms, etc.
(/) A series of small shops serving immediate requirements.
( g ) An effective lighting scheme which will produce a spectacle peculiarly suitable
to the surroundings.
The whole structure will be a never-failing and fascinating novelty, a lode-star to
the newcomer, and a permanent place of enjoyment for all persons in pursuit of relaxa-
tion and entertainment.
VISITORS TO COOGEE ANNUALLY.—The Tramway figures show that
26,610,748 people used the Coogee line in 1923-24, of whom 12,568.421 adults and
931,494 children travelled in the section nearest Coogee, and the Tramway Traffic
Manager also said he considered that on summer holidays six-sevenths of the pleasure
traffic was bound for Coogee, and one-seventh for Little Coogec. A careful analysis of
these figures shows, on a very conservative estimate, that 5,100,000 adults and 500,000
children visit Coogee for purely holiday purposes every year.
PIER TOLLS. —For the purpose of Revenue Estimate, 6d. and 3d. tolls have been
taken as the basis, as they are the maximum permissible under the terms of the lease, and
only one-third of the holiday traffic has been calculated on to use the Pier. But if adults
are only charged 3d. and children Id., the whole of the above number may be counted on.
in which case the yearly revenue from tolls would be £65,833, instead of the £44,583
shown below.

REPORT BY PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS—Messrs. A. F. Lord & Co., F.C.P.A.,
when asked their opinion of the above figures, wrote as follows: —
24th .July, 1924.
“Having examined the foregoing estimates, in conjunction with balance-sheets of similar English
pier companies, various statistics, and other information furnished to us, we are of the opinion that
they present a very reasonable computation of the revenue and expenditure that may be anticipated when
the undertaking is completed and in full operation.”
The rental figures shown above are based on exceedingly conservative estimates, and
the following extract from a letter received from Messrs. Grahame & Godfrey, Limited,
the well-known Estate Agents, of Coogee, is of interest: —
, 16th .July, 1924.
“We are in receipt of offers from reliable people to lease the Theatre, Dance Hall, Cafe and Shops
on the Pier in excess of the proposed amounts of rents agreed to by yout Board in their recent pros-
pectus."
Report by Mr. G. L. D. James, A.R.R.E., M.T. Mcch. E., Hon. M. Aust. Ins. Mrne. E.,
Con sultiny Engincer.
Mr. James, whose services are to be retained by the Company, lias had a wide and
varied experience of Structural Engineering and Architectural Design, covering important
undertakings in America, New Zealand, the Malay States and Australia, and is eminently
qualified to carry out a work of this kind, entailing, as it does, the possession of special
engineering skill, in addition to sound knowledge of the architectural and general prin-
ciples as applied to Pavilions, Theatres and other buildings forming the superstructure
of the Pier. In the course of a detailed report Mr. James says:—
“The beach and locality offer no obstacles to the construction of a Pier, and I consider the proposi-
tion eminently feasible.
“There are over 70 Promenade Piers round the coast of the British Isles, the original one at Brighton,
although constructed on timber piling, having stood for 73 years—lB23 to 1896. A second oicr
was built at the same place in 1866, and a third in 1900. The Pier at Southport in Lancashire was
constructed in 1860, and a number of others over 30 years old are still intact after having been sub-
jected to stormy weather and marine stresses of considerably more violence than have ever been observed at
Coogee. There is no reason therefore, why the same stability may not be obtained in the construction
of a pier at that place.”
“I estimate the cost of the Pier structure complete, as indicated in the above plan, allowing an
adequate contingency item compatible with the nature and location of the proposed work, at one
hundred and seventy thousand pounds ( £170,000), and the time required for construction under two
(2) years.”
Report of an Experienced Naval Officer. —Lieutenant-Commander C. H. Rolleston,
R.N. (retired), who has had nearly 20 years’ sea experience in most parts of the world,
writes as follows :
“Taking the worst weather I have known on the English coast, I should say it would be many
times more violent than the most severe storm known at places like Coogee, Manly or Bondi.
“Most of the English piers I know are built Jn positions where they are fully exposed to bad
weather from the most unfavorable direction.”
GOVERNMENT SUPERVISION.
The entire work of the Coogee Pier is to be carried out in accordance with a specifi-
cation approved by the Public Works Department, an Engineer being appointed by the
Minister to inspect and approve the work during construction on behalf of the
authorities.
OCEAN PIERS—DO THEY PAY?
EXPERIENCE OVERSEAS. —In order to get first-hand data regarding dividends,
damage by storms, etc., letters have been obtained from some of the better-known English
Pier Companies and Seaside Corporations. The replies show dividends and profits
ranging from 6 per cent, to 30 per cent, per annum: one pier, which is in competition with
a more elaborate structure in its immediate neighborhood, having paid 20 per cent, per
annum for the last six years. The lowest returns to hand are from a pier—also one of
two at the same place—which had to expend capital in purchasing and pulling down an
older structure, and whose cost of maintenance is unjustifiably high. The pier toll in
England is generally only 2d. per person.
Note. —lt must be remembered :
(a) That English seaside resorts have only a very short season owing to the climate.
(b) That the Coogee Pier toll may be 6d., though results are almost certain to justify
a reduction.
Item (a) should operate at least to double the earning capacity of the Coogee Pier,
which should be in full use for seven months every year, while getting profitable returns
during the other five. Item (b) should approximately treble the returns.
STORM DAMAGE. —Particular attention is drawn to the fact that the English
Pier Companies, in reply to the question: “Has the Pier ever suffered serious damage
from storms?” in each case answered “No.”
ATLANTIC CITY, U.S.A.—Figures are also available from America’s premier
seaside resort; and show that 10.000.000 yearly visitors support no less than six piers, the
permanent population being only 50,000.
It may be noted, too, that every one of the six piers is built on the open coast,
without a vestige of shelter from storm.
CONTRACTS. —The following agreements already entered into may be inspected at
the office of the Company:—
(a) Between Municipal Council of Randwick and Australian Piers, Limited, dated
14th July, 1924 (lease).
(b) Between Municipal Council of Randwick and Australian Piers, Limited, dated
14th July, 1924 (Agreement).
The following agreements are to be entered into before the construction commences,
and may be inspected at the office of the Company:—
(c) Between Australian Piers, Limited, and Coogee Ocean Pier Company, Limited
(Vendor Agreement).
( d ) Between Coogee Ocean Pier Company. Limited, and George Llewellyn Denton
James (agreement with consulting engineer).
VENDORS’ CONSIDERATION.
The Vendor Company, Australian Piers, Limited, will receive 21.000 fully-paid-up
shares in the Capital of the Company, together with a cash consideration of £4OOO for a
transfer of its interests and obligations under a Sub-Lease and Agreement made with the
Municipal Council of Randwick.
REGISTRATION AND PROMOTION EXPENSES. —The expenses of and inci-
dental to the formation, flotation and registration of the Company will be borne by
the Company. The usual brokerage will he paid.
ALLOTMENT. —Shares will be allotted as applications are received, and if 30,000
shares are not applied for all moneys will be returned in full.
STOCK EXCHANGE. —Application will be made in due course for listing on the
Sydney Stock Exchange.
COMMENCEMENT OF OPERATIONS.—It is anticipated that building operations
will commence early in 1925.

B.: The exultant, almost ecstatic, note of “A Show

How wonderful, Jim, a change in a few years 1
Yes, about twenty years now,
When no pub and no beer,
As we straitened and laid these boughs.
Look ! look ! just look around !
What! what! a contrast!
Still some of the same old faces to be found,
Like an echo from a bugle blast.
Ah, Dick, yes, it’s lovelv to look back,
Of hard times and struggle ;
Now they see us filling our sacks,
And shaking our hands from trouble.
Too honest, it doesn’t seem true.
Yet what can one think?
When one sees everything bright and new,
It’s enough to turn one pink.
Yes, one can hardly realise,
To look around this Show Ground 1
Once to say fools, fleas and flies;
Now to see it going leaps and bounds.
.... C.F.R. : That sort of dealing in abstractions
always makes dull reading... .Jack H.: The weaver
doesn’t get past the half-way house Suby: The

tations of very weak verse... .Molly H.: Too slight
and weak L.T.J.: Almost empty, and ending in
an ear-rending rhyme.... Robert J.: Not quite....

obvious James S.: Not very bright prose forced

Business, Robbery, etc.
“Pick” : At the recent N.R.A. rifle meet-
ing on the Anzac Range at Liverpool
(N.S.W.), the rifles equipped with Litligow
barrels proved quite as effective as those
furnished with imported tubes. And a Lith-
gow-made barrel may be had for nearly £3
less than the other.
* * * *
“Machete”: The new wool-canvas pack,
advocated by Bradford to replace the jute
bale (B. 23/10/’24), will cost more, but the
extra return from wool uninjured by the
admixture of jute fibres is expected to make
up for that. Objections less easily disposed
of are that the metal bands will make samp-
ling more difficult, and an entirely new sort
of woolpress will have to be installed.
* # * *
“Abbot Park”: All Saints', St. Kilda
(Vic.), set an excellent example to other
ecclesiastical bodies when it had its new
organ built in Australia. W. L. Roberts, of
Adelaide, who designed some of the mechani-
cal improvements in the instrument, is the
builder, and his work does him credit. The
solo steps are conspicuously good, and the
tone of the lower portion is very rich and
full. Native blackwood was used for the
case.
* * # #
“X.E.V.” : The picturesque old camel-teams
are fast disappearing from the Western
tracks. Between Wilcannin and Broken Hill
you may pass a solitary team —rarely more,
often none at all. The man with the motor-
lorry jeers at Hooshta and his slow-moving,
smellful string as he whirls past, and the
camel-man retaliates by keeping to the motor-
tracks and cutting them up all he can. But
his days are numbered. Camels which once
sold up to £BO are now hard to get rid of
at a fiver; and a big wool-waggon with all
gear and 30 camels failed to bring its owner
a miserable four hundred at a recent sale.
“Senojo” : The Postal Convention has some
queer things on the prohibited parcels-post
list. Afghanistan won’t take parcels of Rus-
sian rouble-notes; the Bahamas bar loaded
dice; Algeria refuses a quaintly associated
trinity of playing-cards, daggers and babies’
feeding-bottles; Brazil is down on sword-
sticks : Guatemala objects to dead animals,
and Nicaragua places police-whistles on the
“index.” Peru declines to handle the. latest
version of Rudolph Valentino’s all-conquer-
ing love or any other celluloid serial; and
Holland, with a directness that the Com-
monwealth might copy, refuses to soil its
postbags with “pirated editions of copyright
works.”
* * f * *
“Gouger” : On Oct. 15 the first Australian
train-ferry, the Swallow, crossed the Clar-
ence to connect the railway between North
and South Grafton. The queer-looking boat,
once a steam hopper at Rangoon and Sydney,
is 208 ft. long, 30ft. beam, and 860 tons
gross. All the alterations to fit her for her
present job were carried out at the Railway
Commissioners’ workshops at White Bay,
Sydney. At present eight ordinary trucks
can be shipped across ; with the larger “span”,
that is to be erected the number will be in-
creased to 16. One immediate result will be
the reduction of freight charges by between
Bs. and 10s. per ton. Captain ,T. Clunies
Ross is skipper of this latest in river-craft.
* * « *
“Marko”: The choice of localities will
mean more than is yet realised when the
work of turning our wool and cotton into
cloth and fabrics is taken up in earnest. In
England the cloth industry is almost confined
to the two wettest counties; and even then
damp has often to be introduced into the
mills in the form of steam. A man who
owned a mill making the very fine “counts”
required for aeroplane wings assured a friend
that if he moved his mill half a mile away
from the damp hollow in which it was built
he would never make those “counts” again.
The very fine Dakka cloth has been quoted
as an example of what can be done in India’s
dry climate. Actually, it was made in cel-
lars, to which no sunlight could penetrate,
whose floors were permanently wet, and
down the walls of which water was always
dripping. Dakka cloth is not made now
because the conditions killed the operatives.
* * * *
“X2X”: The dried yeast mentioned by
“Jesmond” (B. 2/10/’24) for use in home-
bread making, and which he says is so easy
to obtain in America, is a sort of by-product
of Prohibition. Before America went dry
yeast was prescribed by the medical profes-
sion there about as often as it is in Aus-
tralia, and it was rarely, if ever, that one
came across an advt. for the stuff. But
when the country went dry, and every other
kitchen soon had its own still and ferment-
ing vat, there arose a sudden demand for
the stuff in an easily-used form; hence the
numerous compressed yeast advertisements
in the Yankee papers, and the booming of
the stuff as a panacea for all human ills.
The manufacturers could hardly put it on
the market as what it was, and as its domes-
tic use -is negligible they had to make it
appear that it was a kind of medicine. It is
said that since Prohibition arrived half a
dozen big yeast-manufacturing firms have
made fortunes; certainly I count here in one
magazine nine yeast advertisements.
* * * *
“F.1.N.”: In answer to “Tomb” (B.
18/9/'24), let me say that a sheepman has
often to be cruel to be kind. When one goes
to the expense of moving a trainload of lamb-
ing-ewes from Longreach to Toowoomba, the
necessity is evidently great—a last resort,
in fact. Those ewes that arrived alive (fully
95 p.c., I should say) would lamb and rear
their lambs on good feed. They would not
all lamb in the few days from Longreach to
Toowoomba. If these ewes were left at
home to chance it, they would probably all
die in the drought, and their death would be
more lingering and more cniel than that of
those which died in the trucks: when they
got too weak and went down, the crows would
pick their eyes out for a start, and they
would then linger for a day or two sizzling in
about 150° in the sun. Others would die
from blood-poisoning through the lamb dying
in them from want of nourishment —a pain-
ful death that no S.P.C.A. could help or pre-
vent. Such scenes as described by “Tomb”
are inevitable when the west of Queensland
is as bare of grass as a billiard-table, and
the country is in the grip of the worst drought
in 20 years.

“8.D.”: Talking of precipitate matrimony
(B. 16/10/’24) the courtship of Henry
Kendall’s parents must have been almost a
record for brevity. Basil Kendall and Melin-
da McNally met one day and were married
the next. That was in 1840.
A singularly tender-hearted railway man,
J. T. Spry, has passed away in Adelaide. At
the beginning of September the engine he
was driving killed a woman on a level cross-
ing. It was no fault of his, but he took it
so much to heart that he had a nervous
breakdown, lie was a healthy man before
it happened ; five w T eeks later he was dead.
“Limit o’ Three”: I have to do with sev-
eral charity organisations, and frequently
receive letters showing that the old-time
large families still sometimes occur. Here
is a reply to an inquiry: “Mrs. Johnson has
had eight illegitimate children by John
Brown and one by Peter Smith. He was
struck by lightning.” But wdiy did 1 rovi-
dence select Peter?
Died at Christchurch (M.L.), Howard
Strong, who spent part of his early manhood
chasing Te Kooti and his Hauhaus when
they first went on the rampage, and again
when they escaped from the Chatham
Islands. The veteran then settled down to
the prosaic occupation of chief librarian of
the Flat City, a job he held for 35 years,
and from which he retired ten years ago.
“Phoney” : He was a returned soldier, and
had asked the Customs clerk at a northern
port for a permit to purchase a ticket to
New Guinea. The clerk explained the appli-
cant must have either a job to go to or
£2O in hard cash when he landed. Ihe
Dig. surve'ycd him amazedly. “Twenty
quid! I want to get a job there, not to
buy the darned country.”
“Bill Beetlecruslier” : I was at a Sydney
wharf recently when a oueue of wharfies
were lined up inside the gates. A valuable
cargo of silks had been broached, and several
detectives were searching tucker-tins and
suspicious pockets. Suddenly one of the
men who had been working down the hold
made a dash through the gates. He was
immediately pursued and captured 200 yards
away. When searched his bulging pockets
were found to contain shavings and torn

resigned his position as medical director for

distinguished record in France, was men-
tioned four times in despatches, went down

liodney Cockburn, of S.A. Hansabd staff,
has heard from John. C. Miller, manager
of the Canadian lacrosse team which came
to Australia in 1907. All are alive and
doing well: Coombs, a university professor;
Gilbert, a railway superintendent; Kearns,
a Crown attorney ; and so on. Harry Camp-

for rough play, served overseas, and came
home with his breast covered with medals.
“Atton, poor fellow, has to struggle along
on about 12.000 dollars a year; he is a de-

The aggregate bobby of N.S.W. lately
approached Minister Oakes to suggest that
a basic wage of 15s. per day wouldn't be
amiss. With 4 per cent, off for superannua-
tion (for the long arm of the law buys its
own pension), the proposed pay doesn’t look
much for a service where the demands are
merely honesty, courage, vigilance, intelli-
gence, great physical strength, and a fatal-
istic readiness to be killed at any hour of
the day or night; also for a service in which
overtime pay isn’t provided for. and side-
lines are barred. If, in consideration of the
high cost of living, the bobby’s wage had
been put up in the same fashion as that of
the Federal member, he would already be
collecting 355. a day.
“Hasen”: Surely there is nowhere a de-
sire so deep and insistent as that of a sailor-
man for a speck of earth that he can call
his own. Any old farm will do. This north-
bound boat has so far touched three Austra-
lian States, and with fine impartiality the
Old Man has definitely decided to settle in
each of them at the first opportunity. His
frame of mind suggested that he might be
interested in Hoskins, a farmer with a pub-
licly-announced intention of “getting rid of
the damned place.” The two were intro-
duced by the shipping agent. When the Old
Man appeared again he seemed unenthusi-
astic, even cold, about Hoskins. The agent
expressed his surprise. “Why,” said he, “I
made sure you’d find him interesting. Nice-
little farm he’s got—just suit you. And he's
always talking about getting rid of it.”
“Oh, he wanted to sell all right.” grunted
the mariner. “But d’you think I'd do busi-
ness with a fool who talks about wish-
ing he’d gone to sea?”
“Akran”; When the Hun packed up his
traps and lit out for the Rhine in T 6 he
left behind so many snares for the unwary
that every fresh billet was suspiciously scru-
tinised before packs w r ere dropped. At Fav-
reuil, outside Bapaume, four of our company
occupied a room of one of the shell-shattered
houses. Sitting round the fire after tea we
were discussing the tragedy of the Bapaume
Town Hall, which the Germans had left
mined, their nefarious work resulting in an
explosion that buried about 50 Aussies. Sud-
denly one chap started and turned white.
“Look under the fire,” he yelled, “right on
the hearth.” We all looked, and were not
long in deciding that the object protruding
from the embers wms a huge shell. Everyone
fell down flat and started to crawl out; we
escaped in safety, but there was no inclina-
tion to return to that house for three days.
Then as the shell hadn’t exploded we in-
vestigated. A drain-pipe, on which the
centre of the fireplace had been built up,
was still supporting the ashes.

OBJECTS OF THE COMPANY.
The Company is being formed for the purpose of acquiring from the Vendors, viz., Mandated
Development Company, Limited, the whole of its undertaking in the Mandated territory ot New
Guinea, and for the purpose of developing and turning to account its property there.
INTRODUCTION. ... . . .
The prospect of this Company obtaining oil in commercial quantities is exceedingly bright, in
view of the fact that the Vendor Company has, by its operations, already proved, at a depth ot 42it., the
existence of oil of high quality and in quantities which indicate the presence ot large accumulations.
While it is admitted that all oil ventures are highly speculative, the directors feel justified in
taking the view that the discovery of oil in payable quantities) is more a probability than a possibility
Should those expectations be realised, the reward to the Company’s shareholders should be of no
ordinary character, for, as the history of the oil fields in the United States of America so amply
illustrates, no form of speculation offers such wonderful returns to the investor.
OPERATIONS OF VENDOR COMPANY.
In February, 1924, Mandated Developihent Company, Limited, was granted a License to prospect
for oil and coal over an area of 1000 square miles, which area includes the Matapau oil seepages and the
boring site selected by Professor Schlenzig in 1913. , , , . ..
A prospecting expedition, under the leadership of Mr. J. A. Spencer, was despatched to the area,
arriving there in May. This expedition included Mr. E. A. Briggs, 11. be., At.,Sc., ot Sydney University
as geologist, and Mr. W. Ross as driller. Mr. Ross was formerly employed by the Anglo-Peralan
Company, in Papua, and he has had 25 years’ experience on American oil fields (including 10 years
with the United Oil Company in Colorado, two years drilling contractor in Wyoming, and four years
with the Magnolia Petroleum Company in Oklahoma and Texas). The expedition took with it a suitable
prospecting drilling plant, and operations were at once commenced to prove the existence of mineral
These operations speedily met with success, as early in June, oil was struck at a depth of 42ft.
A bulk sample of the oil obtained, amounting to about 50 gallons, has been brought to Sydney,
and analysis has proved it to be of excellent quality, the benzine and kerosene contents amounting
together to over 55 per cent.
ANALYSTS’ REPORTS.
The Commonwealth Government Analyst’s report, dated 14tli October, states:—
The completed examination of the oil indicated the presence of a heavy benzine fraction; boiling
range 130 deg. F. to ISOdeg. F., specific gravity at 60deg. F.:—0.781 and flash point B_.4deg. F.
The principal components of the volatile fraction of the oil would appear to be unsaturated cyclic
hydrocarbons (naphthenes) as indicated by the high formolite number and aromatic hydrocarbons This
data confirms the opinion expressed in the preliminary report that this elude oil closely resembles
in properties certain types of Borneo petroleum. . „„„
Ths crude oil corresponds in its properties generally to a solar oil, and, without tieatment of any
kind, is suitable for use as a liquid fuel oil.
Messrs. Dixon and Bvrn, of Reiby Lane, Circular Quay, report:— . _
We find it to be a paraffin base oil, containing very little sulphur and only traces of paraffin wax.
It compares very favorably with other crude oils in yield of product, approaching most closely the
Russian (Baku) field in character, showing only a small percentage of benzine and volatile oils, but a
high percentage of both kerosene and lubricating oil fractions, and very little wax and residue.
8 GEOLOGIST’S REPORT.
The following extract from Mr. Briggs’ report summarises his findings:—
1. All the conditions essential to the occurrence of oil are present in the Matapau field.
2. There is definite evidence from the surface indications that oil-bearing strata occur in the
Matapau field. The principal surface indications are:—
(a) Oil seepages or oil springs.
(b) Gas-pools.
(c) Occurrence of salt springs.
3. The most important geologic system, from the standpoint of the occurrence of
throughout the world, is the tertiary. Tertiary rocks yield over 50 per cent, of the world’s
of oil. The beds in the Matapau field belong to the tertiary system.
4. The test bore has proved indisputably the occurrences in the Matapau field of oil-bearing strata
which are first met with at a depth of 42 feet on the side of the Wakip anticline.
5. On bailing this test well, 40 gallons of oil per day have been saved. The well is now
temporarily plugged, but the drilling plant has been left in position.
6. This is the first well to be drilled and the first oil to be obtained in the Mandated Territory
of New Guinea. , ~ , ~ ... , , ...
7. The bore, though plugged, can be speedily opened and the production of oil proceeded with
within a few hours after the working party reaches the field. _ '
8. The analyses of samples taken from 50 gallons of this oil show that the oil obtained from the
Matapau field is very similar in its composition to certain types of oil from the Borneo and Baku
(Russia) fields.
DRILLER’S REPORT.
Mr. Ross reports as follows: — . , ,
“I claim no technical geological knowledge, but from 25 years’ practical experience and personal
observation in the development of the various oil fields of America, I would state that 1 have never
seen any better or more favorable possibilities for the development of a large and profitable oil field
than the area over which this company holds a license.
“To my mind, after having been on the ground and having obtained oil of the quality and quantity
which this proved to be, and at such a shallow' depth, there is little doubt of the future success of
development with equipment large enough to go to any depth required. Although it should not be
necessary to go to more than 1500 feet, we must be prepared to go to 3500 feet in the event of that
bcin 0 * necessary.
“The preliminary work has proven the formation to be uniform and favorable for the accumulation
and retention of oil in large quantities. . .
“The sands in which we found the oil prove to be of a soft and porous nature, which is favorable
for a large production, as it furnishes natural storage for the accumulation of oil and gas. While we
had very little gas in the present bore, more could not be expected at so shallow a depth, as there
was practically no overburden to retain any pressure.”
Professor Sir Edgeworth David, at a lecture given to the Millions Club on 16th September by Mr.
Briggs on the discovery of petroleum in New Guinea, after paying tribute to Mr. Briggs’ ability as
geologist, is reported in the Daily Press to have said: — . . , ,
“Thu Matapau area of the Mandated Territory had previously been examined by representatives
of the Anglo Persian Oil Company, whose report was not very encouraging, but he could not believe they
had seen much of the country, and they certainly had not seen the bore Air. Briggs’ party had put
down. Mr. Briggs, acting as geologist for the Alandated Development Company of Sydney, had examined
the district in greater detail, and had succeeded in locating a site for a bore, near the summit of un
arch in oil-bearing strata. This bore (four inches in diameter) had struck oil bearing sand at a
depth of 40ft and oil worked its way into the bore at the rate of at least 40 gallons a day. With the
petroleum
production
been brought . .
was a great area of oil-bearing formation.
8 CONCLUSION.
The net results of the operations of the Company to date are, that the existence in the area of oil
of high quality has been proved, and the prospects of a large supply are, judging from the geological
l-enort and the opinion of an experienced driller, excellent.

“For my skin and
hair I use only Rexona
Soap, which gives the
best results.”
Miss KA THL'EEN
PICKETT,
882 Few Canterbury
Road,
Dulwich Hill,
N.S.W.
The Use of Rexona Soap
Ensures Beauty to Skin
and Hair.
That natural beauty of skin and hair which cannot be imitated can be
obtained by regular use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary toilet
soaps do not assert this influence. Many of them contain free alkali, which
tends to dry the skin and destroy its delicate texture. Even the best of such
soaps can only cleanse; they cannot heal and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, healing, antiseptic balsams as
Rexona, the Rapid Healer, the value of which in the treatment of skin
affections is known throughout the world. Simply use Rexona Skin and Facial
Soap regularly once or
twice a day, and see if
it does not quickly
soothe and cleanse the
pores, lessen the ten-
dency to pimples, and
leave the complexion
clear, fresh and velvety.

Love Song.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’M in love with a maiden,
She’s only sixteen —
I’m in love with a maid.
Now would I were twenty,
Just twenty again,
The red morning roses,
’ The road and the rain!
Aye, would I were twenty,
‘just twenty again!
Her eyes are like amber,
Her hair lias a sheen,
My sweet little maiden
Of simple sixteen.
So high is my passion
It knows not desire;
’Tis snow in a chalice,
Asbestos in fire.
But would I were twenty
To win and to hold —
All, would I were twenty,
Not fifty and old!
Ah, songs never written!
Ah, stories untold!
I would I were twenty,
Not fifty and old !
VICTORIA.
E. J. BRADY.
Burke’s Bequest.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FATHER ROGUE stood in the aisle of
the little bush church. It was dimly
lit by candles, the background being
in utter darkness, although the hour was
but early evening. Outside, rain tell in
torrents, thunder burst in rippling crashes,
and lightning scuttled in dazzling fretwork
across the blue-black sky—the last phase of
a tropical thunderstorm characteristic ot
Northern Queensland.
The old priest’s gaze rested on a shadowed
recess where stood a statue of the Virgin,
the head crowned with a heavy band of
coarse gold studded with costly pearls. This
crown had a twofold significance. Apart
from its intrinsic value, there was
a romantic story told of it, a story
that went back thirty years _to a
time when the Queensland township com-
prised but half a score of shingled slab-huts,
a store, a pub and the little church with its
adjoining presbytery.
On the outskirts of the settlement a young
prospector and his wife eked out a precari-
ous existence in a small bark shanty. Long
months of fruitless searching failed to quench
Tom Burke’s enthusiasm. Day after. day
he kissed his wife and went into the wilder-
ness with a song in his heart. Night after
night he returned wearily, his big shoulders
drooping with fatigue, but always his dreams
were filled with visions of the big strike he
knew would come, sooner or later. Regu-
larly he called in at the little church, and
one day, after invoking the assistance of all
the saints, he shouldered his kit and set out
swearing to find gold or return no more.
That was the last seen for many weeks of
the big, slouching figure.
Then one night, as the priest sat at his
lonely meal, a crazy individual burst into
the presbytery. For a moment the padre
failed to recognise the face of Tom Burke
in the almost black visage looking out from
a mass of wild, red whiskers and matted hair %
The apparition raised a huge, hairy arm
and bent almost menacingly over the nriest.
“Pr-razes be to the blessed saints, yer
riv’rence!” he said huskily. “I’ve found it
—hidden! Ye’d hardly be believin’ me—
at the foot o’ Two Tree Hill, fifty mile away !
Gold, gold, lashins av it! Look ye!” A
small pile of nuggets weighing many ounces
crashed down upon the table.
“Why, if it isn’t Tom Burke!” exclaimed
Father Roche, picking up the gold and
examining it closely.
“There’s gold in plinty at the foot av that
there shy-lookin’ hill av a thing,” Burke
rattled on excitedly. “Enough an’ more to
take me an’ the missus back to Ireland ag’in.
'Tis rich we’ll be soon enough now, an’ ”
The loud voice ceased suddenly; Tom
Burke’s mouth remained open, and liis little
bright eyes grew calm as he turned them
towards a small statue of the Madonna
standing on a wooden bracket fixed into the
wall. For a few moments lie stood as though
transfixed, the priest watching him curi-
ously. Then he swallowed hard, and shook
himself like a Newfoundland dog leaving
the water.
“That’s afther remindin’ me,” he whis-
pered confidentially as the wonderful thought
dawned on his slow mind, “the statue of
Our Blessed Lady in your mite av a church
where I prayed to the saints —pr-prazes be
to thim! —shall have a crown av real gold
—a foine crown made from the gold the
saints sint me to at the foot av the hill be-
yont. There’ll be pearls in it, too, yer
riv’rince —big, weepin’ pearls that I’ll buy
wid some av the gold.”
Burke was as good as his word. The
crown of gold and pearls arrived, and for
thirty years the responsibility of guarding
it against theft had proved an embarrass-
ment to Father Roche. So much so, that
in recent times it only adorned the head of
the Madonna on the Patronal feast-day, and
on all. other occasions was kept in safe cus-
tody in the bank which had followed the
footsteps of civilisation into that part of the
country. Twenty-five years before, Burke
had disposed of his claim to a syndicate for
a very large sum, and had returned to his
native land with liis wife and two children.
Later on news trickled into the Queensland
township that the prospector and his wife
had passed away, and the daughter had
taken religious vows. The son, according
to rumor, married an actress of Spanish
extraction, who, after squandering her hus-
band s share of the family fortune, dis-
appeared with her baby daughter.
On the evening of the thunderstorm Father
Roche, his long day of service over, was
awaiting the arrival of the parishioner who
usually acted as his escort when returning
the precious crown to the safe-keeping of
the local bank. Presently he mounted the
steps leading to the altar. At that hour,
and especially during such a storm, it was
unlikely that anyone would interrupt him
as with bowed head he knelt at the altar-
rails.
Then suddenly from the black shadows
around the entrance porch of the church
there came a strange sound. To Father
Roche it seemed like a smothered cry o'f
pain or fear, and yet it might have been
a strangled sob. Swift footfalls followed the
cry—rsomebody was running up the aisle!
The priest, turning swiftly, faced the in-
truder.
Straight to him, breathing in’ a distressed
way, as though from running a long dis-
tance, came a young girl. Wet through aud
eoatless, her flimsy black dress clung about
her limbs, leaving a trail of wat°r to mark
her hurried passage to the altar steps. Her
head was bare, and the hair hung in dis-
orderly masses about her shoulders.
She half turned, glanced around wildly
in the direction of the door and faced him
again. A wet hand grasped him convulsively
by the sleeve of his robe.
“They’re coming!” she cried. “Quick —-
hide me —save me —oh, Father, you must
save me!”
“Quickly now, tell me your trouble,” com-
manded Father Roche authoritatively, put-
ting a protecting arm around the slim shoul-
ders, and straining his eyes to pierce the
gloom at the far end of the church.
The girl told her story in a broken, piti-
ful whisper.
“I was decoyed—a woman, Father—a
woman whom I loved and trusted, to the
other end of the town, to —the Chinese quar-
ter, and” here she started to weep pas-
sionately.
The old padre’s lips set in a firm line. If
those yellow fiends had
“Yes, child, make haste and tell me what
happened,” he urged, his heart weighed down
with ominous forebodings. Here was a girl
different from others in the district —and
yet not like a city-bred child. Her voice
was soft and cultured. There \vas something
foreign about her—and a fineness, a delicacy
that was lacking. in others the old priest
had come to know.
“One of the Chinese”—her shudder of hor-
ror was eloquent. “I was in his power—
helpless—what could I do? There was a
brass image there, and I seized it—and—
struck” —her breath came in fluttering gasps
—“perhaps I killed him—l don’t know—he
fell —and I ran—ran !” she finished wildly,
clinging to him again, her eyes wide wir.h
fear, her limbs trembling.
“What was that?”
Listening intently, the priest heard unmis-
takably, above the falling rain, the sound of
a stealthy footfall on the gravel outside.
“Father—quickly ! Don’t let them take
me!” her hands beat entreatingly at his
breast.
“Come then,” he whispered, his glance
sweeping the deserted church and resting
finally on the confessional.
“But you? They might—attack you.”
Tears trembled on the long lashes of the
girl’s eyes.
Touched by her thought for his safety, he
patted the cold hand and smiled reassur-
ingly. “Who would harm an old man?
Don’t worry, daughter, there is no cause for
fear. Step in there now, and calm yourself.”
Leaving her in the security of the confes-
sional, Father Roche passed swiftly out of
the church. The rain had steadied to a
slight drizzle, and, with straining eyes, he
sought to pierce the surrounding gloom.
Fifty yards away the bush began, black
and silent for countless, trackless miles, but
there was no sign of any human presence.
He listened intently for a moment, but the
gentle soughing of the gums was the only
sound that reached his ears. Turning with
a relieved sigh, he was about to re-enter the
church when a woman’s scream, clear and
sharp, rose from the gully down the slope
ahead.
“Help—help!” came the cry, repeated and
ending in a choking gasp.
For a brief instant the old padre hesitated
—all sorts of confused speculations running
through his mind. Undoubtedly, he told him-
self, the Chinese had mistaken some other
poor creature for their quarry, probably some
devout wanderer on her way to visit the
church before it was closed for the night. ~
Then descending the porch steps he hur-
ried down the narrow path, and through the
gate, in the direction of the cry. The heavy
red mud oozed and slipped beneath his feet
as he dodged between the thick-set gums.
Quite unarmed, he had no fear for his own
safety; his thought was all for that poor,
helpless being in the clutches of the Chinese.
Quickly reaching the spot from which the cry
for help had come, he paused uncertainly on
the shelving edge of the gully. No sound;
no indication of human presence anywhere.
Yet, in the depths of his mind, Father Roche
felt that somewhere—it couldn’t be far from
where he was standing—a hapless victim was
securely held by her captors.
Presently a falling stone from half-way down
the slope towards the roaring creek started
him in perilous speed on a descent of the
gully. Three minutes, and the creek waters
were at his feet ; but still he did not sight
his quarry. Peering at the opposite bank, he
scrutinised as much of the rise as he could
see. Desperately, he wondered whether they
had gone that way. Then came a terrifying
clap of thunder, and a brilliant flash of light-
ning illuminated the surroundings clearly; in
that brief instant of light Father Roche
doubted his own sanity. Standing within a
few yards of him was a woman clad in black
raiment, and wearing a peculiar draping over
her head. The old priest’s body became tense
with the sheer uncanniness of the thing, for
the woman’s face was the face of the young
girl he had just hidden in the confessional!
Older, perhaps, and more matured, but still,
just as the fugitive would appear, with the
addition of a lace mantilla, in another twenty
or thirty years.
A prickly sensation crept up the old padre’s
spine to his head, upon which he felt the hair
rise. Was he going mad? Had the night’s
strange events turned his brain? Father
Roche was quite unable to solve the strange
puzzle. Where were the Chinese? If, indeed,
they had been in the gully at all that night'
a possibility which he was beginning to
doubt. And that piteous cry for help?
“Who’s there?” he called, and found that
his tongue and mouth were dry.
No answer. Not the faintest sound could
be heard above the rushing of the creek. The
old priest turned away uneasily, and began
the ascent of the steep incline ahead. Obvi-

ave you any Skin Trouble?
For Eczema, Ulcers, Piles, Ringworm and Obstinate
Skin Complaints ZAM-BUK is Without Equal.
A T this season, when the blood changes its nature, you
must always be on your guard against painful and
obstinate skin diseases like eczema, ulcers and ringworm, which commonly
originate in tiny, inflamed spots and rashes. Examine your skin regularly
and treat the first sign of disorder with Zam-Buk before it leads to nights and
days of fiery torture.
Owing to its perfect refinement and herbal character, Zam-Buk quickly
penetrates to the root of skin troubles; sinking naturally into the pores, it
has a soothing and curative influence on the whole of the underlying tissues.
Zam-Buk creates clear, healthy skin by thoroughly cleansing these tissues of
poisonous germs and stimulating the cells to renewed activity.
If disease has already taken root there is no surer or quicker way of
dislodging it than persistent applications of Zam-Buk. This treatment
quickly overcomes all eruptive and inflamed
conditions of the skin, and completely
banishes all disease.
TORTURING ECZEMA BAFFLES
SPECIALISTS. “I suffered from a severe
outbreak of Eczema on my legs when in France
with the A.1.F.,” writes Mr. J. E. Hannan, 2
Hopetoun Street, Newtown, N.S.W. .
“I was treated by several skin specialists in
France and in England, but in spite of all kinds
of treatment the Eczema grew worse and 1
found no relief whatever.
“I was beginning to despair of ever getting
right again when I thought of Zam-Buk, and I
was agreeably surprised to find that even the
first application afforded some relief. I con-
tinued the regular dressings with Zam-Buk, and
I am glad to say that within a week the fiery
irritation had disappeared and the skin healed
completely.”

ously his help was not required there. His
was not the task to unravel the mystery, so
strangely disquieting. Breathing heavily
after the exertion of his climb, he re-entered
the church, poignantly sensing its peaceful-
ness in contrast with the unfathomable influ-
ences he had encountered outside. Was it
a trick of his overwrought imagination, or
did the sound of a faint mocking laugh follow
him from the blackness outside?
Once safely inside, Father Roche’s thoughts
turned to the fugitive in the confessional. He
fervently hoped she had not heard that dis-
turbing "cry from the darkness. Brief though
his absence had been, he feared she must have
been sorely frightened in the dark, cramped
space, knowing that she was alone in the
church.
Hurrying up the aisle, he reached the con-
fessional, and drew back the hanging cur-
tains.
"My poor child!” he exclaimed compassion-
ately.
The place was empty!
His puzzled glance swept rapidly around
the interior of the church, and finally came
to rest on the statue of the Virgin.
With real fear gnawing at his heart, lie
made a closer inspection ; and then, with
hands clenching rigidly, he reeled and almost
fell. In a flash of understanding he saw
how he had been tricked. Once more memory
recalled the past that was dead and gone,
recalled the story of Tom Burke’s scapegoat
son and the actress who deserted him so
heartlessly. So that was it! Bitterly he
realised the significance of his eerie fancy
in regard to the Spanish head-dress of that
unknown woman in the valley. Mother and
daughter, working hand in hand, had opened
the old priest’s heart, and the demons of dis-
trust and, revenge were clamoring for admis-
sion to the sunlit garden of his soul. For a
brief moment Father Roche was swayed in
the grip of insidious thoughts; then, with
lagging footsteps, he walked slowly to the
altar rails, and knelt in prayer. Strange,
strangled sounds came intermittently from
the bow r ed figure, and the ageing shoulders
heaved convulsively. Presently all was quiet
in the little church. Outside, the rain had
ceased, and a brilliant moon shone down on
the sodden countryside, its bright beams giv-
ing the little township the appearance of a
fairy village done in mother-o’-pearl. Far
out a dow barked challengingly, and from re-
moter points came answering yelps.
Father Roche rose to his feet and prepared
to close the church for the night. There,
in the shadowed recess in the wall, the statue
of Our Blessed Lady looked down benignly
on the deserted pews. A key turned in a
lock, and the church was empty.

The Price of a Dream.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
17JRNEST SPARLOW dreamed a dream.
1 j It came to him oil the day that Delia
Finchett announced to him that she
had consented to marry Jack Bowers. Ernest
Sparlow went away—a long way away. He
left a job as purser on one of the coastal
boats- and travelled Australia for a firm of
wholesale druggists. In five years be had
helped to sell up and down the land cures
for every imagined ache or pain and a few
real ones. In the process he had lost some
of the hair from bis temples and some of the
illusions from his soul. But he had not
ceased to dream the dream.
1 can’t help it if the picture of a rather
drab, smallish man, going bald, and associ-
ated in the minds of a wide circle of retail
gentlemen with variegated smells redolent
of a hospital, is incompatible with the idea
of a man pursuing and pursued by a vision.
It is ridiculous. Sparlow himself thought it
was ridiculous. At least, while he was in
Melbourne. Somehow the vision seemed less
real when be was there. Melbourne was
where Delia and her husband had gone to live.
The one of all her friends whom Mrs. Bowers
(nee Finchett) would have liked most to see
entranced by the loveliness of her home in
South Yarra, its solid air of comfort har-
monised to distinct “modern” tastes, came
not. She would have liked Ernest Sparlow
to become more intimately aware of the
strong impelling personality of the man she
had married. Ernest she remembered as a
nice boy. There had'been a romantic night
or two on board the old s.s. Scarpia when
Delia had been returning from a holiday in
Brisbane, and Sparlow had come to see her
afterwards. But the dreaminess in his
nature that had made those nights remem-
bered palled in the broad light of day in
busy, matter of fact, familiar old Mel-
bourne.
It would have done Ernest Sparlow good
to have come in contact with John, she re-
flected. John had strength of mind, poise and
plenty of practical commonsense, and had
never, as far as she remembered, once men-
tioned such a thing as poetry in her hearing.
He might be a little too matter of fact some-
times ; but, after all, it was easier to deal
with facts than with fancies. Facts were
what one fought the world with ; you wanted
plenty of the right kind, said John Bowers.
This was an aphorism which Delia fancied
worthy to have taken its place among those
sayings of great men she came on, some-
times, sandwiched among the articles in
periodicals.
But Ernest Sparlow chose neither to par-
take of the wisdom of John Bowers nor to
dispose himself in a properly respectful
fashion amongst the expensive “period”
furniture at Yarrabrae. He hurried on bis
way, as fast as he was able, out of the
metropolis that housed the worldly splendor
of John Bowers. lie took bis dream abroad
with him and it comforted him there; it
cheered him when be encountered rough
places and unsympathetic faces. And, after
five years, he was carrying still, up and
down the endless rut, the drugs in his hand-
bag and his own secret specific for bis soul.
I can’t tell you in exact terms what that
dream was. Laws have been framed for the
express purpose of keeping people from pub-
lishing such things as Sparlow imagined
about Mr. Bowers. That gentleman of poise
and force, busied about his flourishing busi-
ness in Flinders-street, would have been
astonished at the certainty with which Spar-
low’s mind held tile idea of his ultimate
downfall.
By this I do not mean that Ernest Spar-
low. travelling agent, bore always with Ms
bagful of potions a head full of poisonous
thoughts. He visioned the downfall of
John Bowers with a fatal inevitability and
with a certain amount of sorrow, relieved
by the thought of the magnanimity that
could and would be shown to a man humbled
materially and spiritually to the dust. Just
how Bowers, the man whom he had seen once
and saw in imagination always, was to be
brought to his downfall Sparlow never
established quite clearly in his mind. It
was to be accomplished, he conjectured, com-
pletely and finally by the forces of some ob-
scure fate. A mocking cast was over the
square and, after a rugged fashion, hand-
some face he carried in his memory. In its
features Sparlow had discovered signs of dis-
sipation, such as a slight slackness at the
corners of the mouth. He pictured an in-
solent expression covering a good-natured
carelessness. On this he dwelt. It was
as though an engineer had found a flaw in
the strains and stresses of a complicated
structure and knew its end.
The fabric of Delia’s happiness lay under
a perpetual menace. Often in his dreams
Sparlow saw himself trampling over the
ruins of her life to reach her with help in
calamity. This sense of achievement, con-
tinually retasted, filled Ernest Sparlow's
mind, as it were, with a dream bride
cherished grimly and even at times savagely.
But always a glimpse of the busy air which
habitually hung over the establishment where
John Bowers had his sign, and the look of
solid matter-of-fact prosperity that pervaded
it, left him abashed, and he crept away tast-
ing momentarily the bitterness of one who
feels his dreams paling into foolishness. Once
out of reach of these disturbing influences
his pride perched again on its impossible
pedestal.
After five years of this there came a day
when Sparlow, passing down Flinders-street,
saw another name over the place where had
been the name of Bowers. A sense of fore-
boding rushed upon him, swift and sharp,
lie who had imagined the falling of Fate’s
hand so often was faint when he saw at
last its reality.
It was with a queer feeling of inevita-
bility that a few days later he came, in a
hotel bar in Sydney, on the ghost of John
Bowers. He could scarcely believe his eyes.
The spectre was standing at the end of a
bar counter. A worn suit bagged around the
heavy frame. A collar that seemed to have
missed a washing-day or two sagged below
the unshaved double chin. Clumsily the
shaking fingers were rolling a cigarette. He
looked, Sparlow thought, like a man who
had taken two or three steps on the down-
ward path and approached very near to the
stage where the sliding process usually be-
gins. He was a shadow of the Bowers of
his dreams.
He went up to him. “Mr. Bowers?” he
said.
The head did not turn. Sparlow’s hand
fell on the bowed shoulder. He received a
look, mild, enigmatical and alcoholic.
“Hullo,” Sparlow pursued.
“Hullo,” listlessly, with a fatuous grin.
“You remember me?”
The tousled head shook. The discolored
Ups parted to moisten the cigarette paper,
une bleared eye screwed itself up.
“I’m Sparlow, Ernest Sparlow. I knew
your wife.”
Sparlow thought he saw a sudden gleam of
energy, appreciation or cunning, he could not
be sure which, appear in the soddendooking
eyes. But it vanished immediately.
“Yes.”
“Come over here.” Sparlow led the way
to a deserted commercial-room. “Look here,”
he said, “I don’t want to intrude, but you
look down on your luck.” He said it exult-
ingly because of the vision he had cherished.
The heavy head of the man before him
hung down. It seemed like a mute and
piteous acknowledgment of the tragic ending
of the visioned drama.
Sparlow softened. “I don’t want to pry."
he said, “I want to help you. I knew your
wife.” The hanging head moved slightly.
“How is she?”
“She’s —she’s —hungry.”
“Hungry! Good God!” Sparlow leaped
to his feet. “Hei-e’s a fiver. Take it. Go
at once. Meet me here to-morrow and we’ll
talk things over. Don’t say wdiere you got
the money from. Don’t mention me. See?”
The shade of Bowers, with mumbled words
of thanks, arose and moved away.
On the following day Sparlow relieved
himself of a five years’ burden of emotion
and the best part of five years’ savings in
placing a spruce and cleansed edition of John
Bowers on the way towards establishing an
indenting business. He made but one stipu-
lation. Delia was not to know where the
money had come from. Sparlow wanted to
keep to himself the sweetness of his triumph.
To have allowed it to become an ordinary
matter-of-fact benefaction would have spoiled
it utterly.
Stepping from the train in Melbourne a few
days later he met Alf Arnott, also of the
“roads.” He was able to announce a few
moments later the effectiveness of a couple
of drinks in clearing from his throat the
dust of the journey. Then he began to speak
with a glow of satisfaction, an almost unholy
elation of what had liapened to him in
Sydney. , . , ~
“Struck Bowers. You know him probably
—used to have a motor business in Flinders-

remarked. He felt for a moment that he
might have tried to disguise with some sort
of casualness the note of jubilation in his
voice.
Arnott, pouring sodawater into Ins whisky
with a sparing hand, grunted.
“Bowel’s?” he said. “Some mistake,
surely. Was talking to him only last night.
He’s shifted round into Elizabeth-street, you
know. Doing damn well, he says—here, why.
hang it man, don’t spill your liquor all over
me. What’s up?”
But Ernest Sparlow was himself again,
except for something that had gone for ever.
“Oh, nothing—nothing!” he said, a little
wearily, after a pause. “I heard —I heard
—some —foolish story.” _

! The Best Time^of
Your Life
Opinions differ as to which is the best time
of one’s life. Some think childhood’s days
are brightest, some think the early twenties,
while others consider the mature years of
middle life the most agreeable.
On one point, however, all are agreed. The
best time of life must be when your health
is at its best.
Many people say that the best time of their
lives began when they commenced to take
Beecham’s Pills. This famous remedy gave
relief from disorders such as biliousness,
constipation, sick headache or flatulence,
which had to some extent darkened their
lives, and it brought them new health, new
energy and a new joy of living.
