WALMER CASTLE, RESIDENCE OF THE CINQUE PORTS LORD WARDEN
A DJOINING Deal, on the south coast, is the town of Walmer, which has
played an important part in the naval history of England, for here, within
a few yards of the shore, is Walmer Castle, the official residence of the Lord
Warden of the Cinque Ports.
It is a low, round-towered building, of which the earliest parts date
from the time of Henry VIII. The three castles of Walmer, Sandown and
Deal were built on a similar plan, and consisted of a central, reputed to have
been designed by a German engineer, Stevan von Hashenperg, and were
completed before the year 1540. Forty-eight years later (1588) there were
scenes of great activity in these fortresses under
Spanish Armada, and the Cinque ports (Dover, Hasting, Hyte, o ey
and Sandwich) equipped six large vessels, each accompa y -
Pm Atffie beginning of the Civil War Walmer Castle fell almost immediately
into the hands of the Parliamentarians, but was later captured by the Royalists.
The King’s successes were short lived, however, and in July, 1648, the garrison
was stormed into submission by the Parliamentarians under a Colonel Rich.
At the beginning of the 18th century Walmer Castle became the official
residence of the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, the first to live there being
the Duke of Dorset, who was appointed in 1708.
From earliest times the post of Lord Warden has been held by men of
distinction, and on many occasions by members of the Royal Family,
Edward I, Henry V, Henry VIII and James II all held the post before coming
the throne: Prince George of Denmark, husband of Queen Anne, was
appointed towards the end of the 17th century, and was followed by William
p. . whose appointment covered the anxious years when England was
under the threat of Napoleonic invasion. The Duke of Wellington became
£ on j harden in 1829, and held the appointment until his death at the castle
24 years later £, uring that time Walmer was visited by Queen Victoria, who
spent three weeks at the castle with the Prince Consort and their two eldest
children. , c r . w , , „ . , ~ .
In more recent times the a W>^ntment haS been he d by

AN AUSTRALIAN EPIC.
Francis Webb first had a poem pub-
lished in The Bulletin when he was 17.
A Drum for Ben Boyd, printed ip this
paper about two years ago and just pub-
lished in attractive format by Angus ancj
Robertson, with spirited illustrations by*
Norman Lindsay, was written when he
was 22.
When I first read it my opinion could
be stated in two words; it was major
poetry. After reading it again in book
form, I am still of the same opinion.
It is a term I use reluctantly. There
is nothing I like better in A. G. Stephens’s
criticism than his hesitation in bestowing
even on Hugh McCrae and Shaw Neilson
the proud title of “poet.” At this
date we hardly need to be so
scrupulous about those two exquisite
lyrists, who should have a permanent place
among the minor poets of all times and
all countries. But major poetry is an-
other matter.
The term implies a certain largeness:
largeness of mind, largeness of heart,
largeness of vision, bulk of output. It
requires a comprehensiveness of mind
which, expressed in the diversity of a
lifetime’s effort, creates a world of its
own: Shakspeare’s world of the passions ;
Browning’s gallery of portraits; Words-
worth’s recreation of nature; and, in
spite of the naivety of his sociology,
Shelley’s resplendent vision of the inter-
penetration of heaven and earth. And
with this essential largeness there must
go a mastery of technique; and, beyond
everything, shining through all the work,
the mysterious and indefinable quality
without which poetry is not poetry; that
which, in Goethe’s phrase, awakes “the
tremor of awe,”
Of major poets in this sense of the
term Australia, so far, has had none.
Christopher Brennan has been submitted
as a candidate for the distinction. He
has a tolerable bulk—perhaps one-
twentieth of Browning’s; he has a good
technique in the sonorous way of Milton
and Dr. lohnson; something white and
visionary, like moonlight, shines through
his verse ; and his gloom was as large as
the night. But where is the sunlight?
Where is the richness of diversity? What
world had Brennan but himself?
Since Bernard O’Dowd’s mannered and
ingenious “Poetry Militant” was lack-
ing altogether in enchantment, and since
Baylebridge, also prosaic and political,
was, except in imitations of Shakspeare
and Wordsworth, technically uncouth,
Brennan is the nearest Australia has had
among the writers of the past to a major
poet. But he did not create like the
masters a world for humanity to live
in, but a world for himself to die in; the
expression of a minor talent. There is
more of the breadth and gusto of great-
ness in “Banjo” Paterson than in Bren-
nan, though the balladist, of course,
stopped a long way short of true poetry.
Indeed, in all the arts in Australia the
single major figure to date is Norman
Lindsay.
Norman Lindsay, that is to say, is the
only Australian creative artist who has
made of his personal vision of life anew
world, a world as wide as the earth we in-
habit, and, like the earth, dark or shining
with intimations of hell and heaven. But
just as Gruner and Streeton, without the
full-bodied magnificence of Turner,
painted a few pictures that in themselves
were major works of art —“Spring Frosts”
and “Fire’s On” —and as we have had a
few major novels though no really great
professional novelist, so there have been a
few major works in Australian poetry. Per-
haps, after all, “The Wanderer” might be
regarded as such, the climax of Brennan’s
art, with something Satanic and majestic
in its struggle, “foredoomed disastrous,”
upon the final ridges of the world.
Certainly Kenneth Slessor’s “Five Bells”
and “Five Visions of Captain Cook” are
major works ; as are Robert Fitz Gerald’s
“Essay on Memory” and “Heemskirck
Shoals.” These are living writers, still
comparatively young ; it is impossible at
the present stage to assess their final
stature. Fitz Gerald, in particular, is
clearly developing—from “The Hidden
Bole” and “Essay on Memory” to
“Heemskirck Shoals” and “Fifth Day”—
step by step from philosophical verse to a
poetry of action and character, and his
best work is probably yet to come.
It is in the company of “Captain Cook”
and “Heemskirck Shoals,” to which it is in
no way inferior, that I would place A
Drum for Ben Boyd. For Webb to have
written it at the age of 22 is an extraordi-
nary achievement; without parallel, I
imagine, considering its maturity and its
merits, in'Australian literature. To have
written, within the next two years, in spite
bf the interruption of the war, when his
service with the R.A.F. took him to
Canada, two more long poems to follow
it —“Disaster Bay” and the study of Leich-
hardt called “Pantomime” —means that
Webb has already a body of work that,
simply as bulk, is not far short of any
yet produced in Australia. And these two
poems had merit as well as size: in “Dis-
aster Bay” chiefly a descriptive quality—
And now, as a cloud topples from the moon
like a leech.
The seaway eases and flakes into brilliant caves,
A gully of pearl loops out on the distant beach,
And oars of silver lick at the turning waves —
but in “Pantomime,” depicting the con-
trast between the heroic Leichhardt of
the explorer’s dreams and the comic
Leichhardt of everyday life, an impas-
sioned profundity for which “merit” is
too tame a word:
So all of you, my friends, have conquered
laughter?
That creased and monstrous painted effigy
That sags and billows behind you—at the desk,
the typewriter, in the shaving-mirror?
You may write words or ride in omnibuses,
Give lectures, name a river, kill a man,
But always the obscene, the senseless titter
Tenses your shoulder-blades. Start up in fury,
Double your fist and strike! Strike , till the
painted
Mouth splays with blood, from the glass
goggling eyes
Tears trickle, and the pudgy limbs go loose —
What have you forced but laughter, tears of
laughter?—
The fat doll shaking with it, a giggling scream
Babbling and fluttering round you.
Both these poems, to a far greater ex-
tent than A Drum for, Ben Boyd, are
open to criticism. In all Webb’s work,
though only momentarily in the “Pro-
logue” of Ben Boyd, there is some turgid-
ness and confusion —inexplicable ejacu-
lations, sentences that end in the air—a
fault that time will correct. “Disaster
Bay,” more seriously, Tacked movement
because it was based on mere event and
accident instead of human character.
The Leichhardt poem took too long
to start moving, and it was “difficult.”
But not as difficult as “Sordello,” not
, nearly so harrowing a test of the reader's
endurance as “The Revolt of Islam.”
Complete and consistent maturity of
style is a little too much to ask of a poet
in his early twenties.
“Pantomime” had virtues which far
outweighed its faults ; it was more deeply
exciting than anything Webb had written
before; he dramatised Leichhardt as a
central figure in a way that he had not
done with Ben Boyd; and, tortuous
though the form might be, he had struck
out for himself in this poem, He was
breaking ne\y ground.
In A Drum for Ben Boyd, as anybody
familiar with Kenneth Slessor’s poetry
will instantly recognise, Webb is follow-
ing the pattern of “Five Visions of Cap-
tain Cook.” If the astonishing maturity
of thought is his own, if the vision and
the language are his own, the form is
Slessor’s. That accounts —partly—for its
assurance; one might as well say its per-
fection. As Slessor builds up his picture of
Captain Cook through the eyes of his
associates, so Webb gives us Ben Boyd
through the eyes of a group of observers.
But only the form, the outer framework,
like the shape of a sonnet or a play deriv-
ing from classic models, is Slessor’s:
the rest, the living flesh of the poem, is
Webb’s. He shows us Ben Boyd as an
old Norwegian boatbuilder saw him:
Burning for one fierce second, protagonist
Of a world tangled in flame, despair and
darkness,
I saw the Wanderer glide in, knew it was gliding
Into my last defenceless anchorage....
as a journalist saw him:
With those eyes like talons, that blackguard
confidence,
He’ll grind out a fortune, rule this blasted
colony
While I sit here rotting slowly between
editions....
as Sir Oswald Brierly, the marine
painter, saw him:
I always think of him
As something past purpose, insensate, batter-
ing cliffs
With a forehead fruitless and obstinate as the
surf.
Something draws you to a cliff —you see your-
self
Enlarged, and sometimes you bate the surf
As sometimes I hated Boyd, you feel ominous
currents
Dragging you away from humanity. But, pass-
ing on,
You do not quickly forget such magnitudes.
Something in my brain is atrophied, fallen away,
And this, I suppose you could say, is Boyd,
or something about him....
as an irate whaler at Twofold Bay saw
him:
A dressed-up ape with a patronising stick
Pointing you out to his friends as a sound
machine
Capable of so many tricks when fed on three-
pence—
There’s Mr. Blasted Boyd. *..
as, in a beautiful and dramatic picture of
the simple savage encountering the black-
birder in the sailing ship, a Papuan shep-
herd saw him:
Through the thick morning steam they took
shape,
With fierce white symbols shaking above them
in air:
Sea monsters from icy regions bringing cold
tides with them.
Some of us trembled and clapped hands slowly
in fear,
While others fingered their spears and stones
in doubt;
But when flame sprang, and spirits squeaked
overhead
And an incredible thunder troubled the trees,
We crouched in terror lest our sky drip blood.
And then the men with bloodless, brittle faces.
With ferocious prayers, solemn and rhythmical,
Seized many of us, the young and the virile,
Dragging us through the surf to impure burial
In the bellies of their tamed monsters....
as a politician, closing a hypocritical eye
to “the goings-on rumored from that
town of his,” saw him; as a pioneer of
Monaro saw him;
I have loved two things deeply: the earth and
silence,
Two giant bulks furrowed by cold harmony.
I know this Boyd: a builder of lighthouse
towers
Maintained for his own craft only—let others
perish;
He has given us other samples of his building:
An evil town, veined with corruption and
murder,
Clinging like a swollen leech to the bay’s lips....
as the captain of the Oberon saw him
after the adventurer’s death in Guadal-
canal —holding a skull which, as it turned
out, wasn’t Boyd’s;
Dead men have the power
To mock us even while we juggle their actual
bones;
They have slipped clean out of illusion, and they
grow—
Six feet when he died —this fellow would top
a cloud!
The thing’s too full of ghosts—l hate the feel
of it.
Holding it is like splintering a mirror
And finding a thousand faces round your
b00t5....
and, filially, as John Webster had seen
him on the fatal voyage:
Once out in the mist, taking the falling weather,
Boyd seemed to drink in color; when he spoke
You almost saw flesh and ribs within his
schemes,
You saw anew state in the Tropics, a huge
army.
But more often came this new weapon of irony
Turned in against himself, something was
shifting
And breaking up, some pojver that had held
his eyes
Turned outward only. The end came none too
soon.
I saw him pause a long moment, like a
swimmer
Before the plunge into green, opaque density.
Would not that have pleased him? (unpre-
dictable,
As he called himself, not to be tied down),
That his final appearance was not as the half-
corpse
In tangible bedclothes with an odor of crepe
and tears,
But as the shadow at the distant end
Of a tunnel of sunlight; for his last office
A couple of shots rapped out like sharp com-
mands :
And a moment’s peace over the whole island.
And all this is profoundly original
poetry. It tells the whole dramatic story
of Ben Boyd subtly and with increasing
penetration. It arouses —by the simple
device of not bringing Boyd personally
on stage —the sense of awe, of mystery,
aspiration and tragedy embodied in the
figure of a great but.flawed adventurer..
It sets down in memorable form a haunt-
ing Australian legend. It ranges at ease
in space and time, showing the collapse
of Boyd’s town at Twofold Bay as a
“summary of Knossos and sweep of
Nineveh.” It creates, with apparently
effortless fertility, a dozen vital charac-
ters, each acutely observed and each set
down —the vituperative journalist, the
weary Brierly, the dignified squatter—in
a style precisely suited to his personality.
It is supple, varied and fresh in technique,
so capably written as a whole that there
is no fault worth the finding. It has
humor, it has humanity, it has tragic
depth and an inspiring vision of the
heroic.
If the form comes from Slessor, and
if traces of the influence of Fitz Gerald
can also be discerned, I cannot see
that that is at all to its disadvantage. The
borrowings are trivial, but every poet
must learn his trade somewhere, and it is
surely an admirable and heartening thing
that we have poems in Australia that
can serve as models or inspirations for
narratives of the stature of A Drum for
Ben Boyd: a poem of book length, a
major effort of creation.
There is, in fact, something like a
narrative movement taking place in Aus-
tralian poetry, and it derives much of
its impetus from Slessor and Fitz Gerald.
“Five Visions of Captain Cook” was writ-
ten before its time; first published, I
suppose, 15 or more years ago, it is only
now beginning to make itself felt, pro-
viding a pattern for form, a model for
style, and directing attention to a voyager
of* the Pacific and so by implication to
all those men of action—explorers and
navigators, heroes and scoundrels —who
will form in the distant future the Aus-
tralian mythology. While Slessor’s
poetry lay fallow, Robert FitzGerald
came along with “Essay on Memory,”
and not only reminded all Australian
writers that long poems could and should
be written but, probably to a greater ex-
tent than was ever possible to Slessor,
infused into Australian poetry abrupt
and urgent vitality.
“Essay on Memory” forced into the
Australian poetic consciousness
the tremendous leagues of summer south
Thunder-oppressive with curbed energies
and it begins to look now as if the curb
has been broken. We have had an im-
pressive number of long poems, narra-
tives of adventure, in recent years. Not
only A Drum for Ben Boyd, “Disaster
Bay” and “Pantomime,” but Fitz-
Gerald’s “Heemskirck Shoals,” Rosemary
Dobson’s “The Ship of Ice,” and, lately
in The Bulletin, John Blight’s “Pyra-
mid.” A number of writers have written
shorter poems on similarly large themes,
and the Caxton Press, of Christchurch,
New Zealand, has recently announced
the publication in book form of William
Hart - Smith’s Christopher Columbus,
fragments of which, published at differ-
ent times, have been highly promising.
And, running parallel with this move-
ment, there has been the stream of Judith
Wright’s lyrics, presenting as a whole an
extraordinarily rich and vital image of
Australia —its people, its towns, its land-
scape, its history.
I am suspicipus of movements. They
mean rules and formulas, and poetry
cannot be bound. They mean imitation ;
they mean that inferior verse is accepted
because it serves the purposes of the cult.
And yet there has never been a
great period in the world’s poetry,
from the Greek and the Eliza-
bethan dramatists down to the Romantic
Revival of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats,
Byron and .Shelley, without some com-
munity of spirit that, whether or not it
was recognised as a movement at the
time, was afterwards seen to promote
some common principle, to be inspired
by some common source of energy; a
flowering of national vitality.
It seems that such a stage is approach-
ing in Australian poetry. In the past we
have had the ballad and the lyric; we
have now something that is beginning to
look remarkably like the epic. Nobody
who is a member of The Bulletin staff,
and who likes to see a fine tradition con-
tinuing, could fail to take pleasure in
the fact that this paper, which published
Paterson, and which published McCrae
and Shaw Neilson, has had the honor
of publishing the lion’s share of these
long poems; but they are written to
no Bulletin formula. Indeed, it is
obvious that the hope for the move-
ment — if one must call it that—lies
in the avoidance of formula, especially
in avoiding any restriction to Australian
historical themes and restriction to the
heroic ideal. Diversity lies in analysing
and dramatising character, as Francis
Webb does in the minor figures of Ben
Boyd and in the central figure of “Panto-
mime” ; freedom lies in ranging the
whole world for significant themes, as
Robert FitzGerald did when he wrote his
“Fifth Day” about the trial of Warren
Hastings.
How far this trend towards the epic
and towards major poetry will go is any-
body’s guess. There was a similar move-
ment in America when Vachel Lindsay,
Hart Crane and Carl Sandburg were
writing, but what it was finally worth
strictly as poetry —nationally, and as a
basis for poetry it must have been vitally
important—I do not know. I believe
that what has recently been written in
Australia is quite as valuable as that
American efflorescence; and the work,
being large of mind and heart, has con-
siderably more of the true qualities of
major poetry than the agitations of death,
despair and politics which have charac-
terised recent English poetry. The work
as a whole certainly far exceeds in stature
anything previously achieved in Aus-
tralia.
Which does not mean that poets who
have written a few major works can yet
be described as major poets. And, good
as much of the work has been, it is still
a long way from Homer. But the
Homeric spirit is in it. And, without
hoping rashly that such a king of poetry
as Homer will appear, one can say that
sooner or later —and the day, it seems,
may be close —Australia will have its
Wordsworth, its Browning, or its Shelley.
We have still to see what FitzGerald and
Judith Wright are going to perform; ana
if Francis Webb does not develop from
the author of major poems into a major
poet —A Drum for Ben Boyd at the age
of 221—1 shall retire from active
prophecy.

How to blue gun-barrels?
There are two formulas for bluing
gun-barrels: (1) Dissolve two parts
of crystallised chloride of gallic acid
in four or five parts of water; apply
with a small sponge, and then let
dry in the air. Repeat this two or
three times, then wash with water
and dry. Rub with boiled linseed oil
to deepen the shade; repeat until
satisfied with result. (2) Heat evenly
in a muffle until the desired blue color
is raised, the barrel being first made
clean and bright with emery-cloth,
leaving no marks or grease or dirt
upon the metal when the bluing takes
place, then allow to cool in the air.
But it requires considerable experience
to obtain an even, clear blue, and
is best carried out by a gunsmith.

C.R.: The cause of the Ice Ages
is not actually known, but a good
mapy theories have been proposed to
account for them. However, there is
no certainty that the sun has been
cooling continuously during the past
few million years, and indeed other
stars are observed to vary their bright-
ness by very large amounts. If the
sun varied by only a small amount
it could easily give rise to an Ice Age.

Much more than you think! 66 lb. is the free baggage allowance
on all Speedbird routes, plus what you carry—overcoat, magazines
and books. Here is how your 66 lb. might be made up. A big
lightweight case (weighing about 6£ lb.) in which you can pack,
say, the following 39-| lb. of clothing: lounge suit —tweeds and
flannels or dinner jacket—2 tropical suits —3 pairs of shoes —16
shirts —and all you need in the way of pyjamas, underclothes and
etceteras. This leaves about 201 b. for toilet kit and extras in a
small night-stop case. In fact, for you, sir, 66 lb. means all you
want for a month’s world air travel. For you, madam, because of
your much lighter clothing, more than enough of everything.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
IN A SOVIET SATELLITE.
As described by one of the
most able correspondents in
Europe, what may be called the
“new look,” Kremlin design,
comes to a Soviet satellite, Bul-
garia :
“At the end of the Fatherland
Front congress which officially
turned Bulgaria into a one-party
State the citizens of Sofia and
the visiting delegates streamed
for hours past the red opera
house in which the congress was
held. On the steps—at a safe
and well-guarded distance from
the crowd Prime Minister
Georgi Dimitrov benignly smiled
and waved.
“The crowds carried torches
and banners and flags. They
sang and chanted and sometimes
danced as they passed the
Premier. The chant most fre-
quently heard was Di-mi-t/ov,
Di-mi-trov, long live Dimitrov!
but there was also an occasional
Stalin, Ti-to, Di-mi-trov /
“This was a ‘spontaneous
demonstration,’ Bulgarian ver-
sion. Bulgarian and visiting
foreign Communists pronounced
it indisputable proof of the una-
nimity of the people and the uni-
versal popularity of the Father-
land Front Government.
“The people were smiling all
right as they turned their faces
toward Dimitrov. But there was
something so forced about those
smiles as to appear imbecilic.
And indeed the Dimitrov Gov-
ernment has progressed very far
toward reducing the general
population to a state of com-
pliant idiocy.”
The correspondent, “Wall-
street Journal’s” Joseph E.
Evans, was one of seven who
visited Bulgaria at the invitation
of dictator Georgi Dimitrov’s
Government, and maybe Georgi
would like to catch up with him.
His account —one of the most
telling and complete descriptions
of life in a Soviet satellite so far
published—adds that the crowds
Dimitrov reviewed that day were
told to be there. They were told
when and what to do and what
would happen if they didn’t go.
What would happen was at the
least that they would lose their
food-ration cards, perhaps their
jobs. Perhaps they would be “in-
terrogated” by the militia —that
is, the political police.
They were told by the local
Fatherland Front block-leaders.
Sofia and every Bulgarian city,
Evans reports, is divided into
blocks, zones, groups, sections,
each headed by a Communist
agent. In the case of schools
letters were received from the
Ministry of Education.
“Communist Bulgaria,” a'dds
Evans, “is a police State as much
as Nazi Germany ever was, and
very similar —complete with con-
centration camps, torture
chambers, slave labor, the Block-
leiter system of informers and
oppressors, distortion of text-
books, total suppression of poli-
tical opposition and opposition
press.
“To be in this country even
briefly is not only a sickening
but a creepy experience. One
begins to wonder if the whole
world is like this, a network of
spying and horror. The very
sight of the enormous new Zis
(Russian Packard) limousines —
the cars which transport Bul-
garia’s leaders —with heavy cur-
tains drawn over all windows
except the driver’s is indescrib-
ably minister.”
If anyone should mistakenly
not go along “spontaneously” or
should otherwise require per-
suading, there are ways and
means: “A favorite militia tor-
ture is to stand a person on his
tiptoes, arms outstretched, his
fingertips touching the wall. This
may go on for three or four
days. Every time he collapses,
he is helped up with a rubber
truncheon. Another device for
securing information or co-
operation is to stand a man in
water up to his waist and leave
him there for 24 or more hours.
“More subtle psychological
tortures include simulating terri-
fying sounds outside an already-
exhausted man’s cell in the
middle of the night, and the end-
less interrogations themselves —
calling the victim in from his
cell at any hour of the day or
night, repeatedly, day after day,
never allowing him to get
enough sleep to think clearly or,
finally, to care.
“It is this sort of thing,” com-
ments Evans, “which reduces
human beings to dithering idiots,
which produces those amazing
confessions, so reminiscent of
those at the Moscow purge
trials in 1938.”
The Evans report adds that
while the militia carries on its
tortures Bulgarian officials point
with pride to the low rate of
crime in Bulgaria and the ex-
cellent treatment prisoners re-
ceive. Evans explains ;
“Criminals under sentence can
receive passes to go home to their
families during the day. They
get cultural lectures —after a
while here the very word culture
is enough to turn the stomach —
and instruction in useful work.
After all, they are only criminals,
not nearly so dangerous as
people who dare think.”
The real criminals, £0 re-
garded, are those suspect on poli-
tical grounds: “There are several
classes of political persecutees in
Bulgaria. Some, like Petkov, are
given phony trials and murdered,
others are deprived of the right
to work or get food rations.
Others are sentenced to concen-
tration camps. Still others are
banished from Sofia to the pro-
vinces. This last would seem a
fairly light punishment, but its
implications are not pleasant. It
means uprooting one’s life, los-
ing one’s possessions, trying to
find non-existing accommoda-
tions in some village and being
under constant police surveil-
lance, with daily or semi-weekly
reports to the militia. From the
Government point of view, ban-
ishment has the double advant-
age of providing more housing
in the capital for the faithful
and turning Sofia into a com-
pletely Communist city, as well,
of course, as shipping dangerous
elements to places where they
can do less harm. No term is set
to the banishment.”
In Sofia, the report also states,
every room suitable for housing
must be occupied by two people.
“The explanation, oddly enough,
is not the housing shortage but
that a person might tend to
brood if he lived alone. To
which it might be added that
two people living together are in
a better position to spy on each
other than if they were living
separately.
“The network of mutual
espionage permeates everything.
When people are released from
concentration camps it is usually
on the condition that they inform
for the militia. Porters in apart-
ment buildings are forced to in-
form on tenants, as are servants
on employers, particularly if (he
employers are foreign.”
Summing up with a shudder,
Evans comments that “it would
be pleasant if one could take the
edge off all this horror a little
by reporting some great social or
economic advance it has
furthered,” but “unfortunately
that is impossible”: “the
economy is a shambles, looted
by the Soviet Union and the
Communist Government. As to
social progress—you have, it is
true, a youth organisation, a
women’s organisation, a‘chamber
of culture, organisations of all
kinds. Their one purpose, how-
ever, is permanently to establish
that unanimity of opinion with-
out which no dictatorship,
whether Hitler’s, Stalin’s or
Dimitrov’s, can hope to last.”
That it might not last so long,
even in Balkan satellites, if war
came can probably be numbered
among the strong deterrents of
any Kremlin-launched war. Per-
haps, even without war, such a
system might not stand very long
against the unified reconstructed
Western Europe now steadily
building.
U.S. Population Boom.
The American population
boom, at a rate of increase far
outrunning all estimates, is being
maintained. Since the previous
census in 1940 the increase in
less than eight years amounts to
14.000.
In 1939 the total for the U.S.
was 130,880,000 ; by August of
last year, the latest date for
which the Census Bureau has
adjusted its figures, the total had
climbed sharply to 144,239,000,
and a London “Times” survey
shows the figure as now over
the 145,000,000-mark.
Even without any consider-
able immigration, what are held
to be conservative official esti-
mates put the 1950 population at
150.000.
A striking feature has been
the shift towards the Pacific
side. According to estimates of
the Census Bureau, numbers in
the Pacific Coast States (Wash-
ington, Oregon and California)
rose by 40 per cent, from 1940
to 1947, The north-eastern,
north - central and southern
regions (which contain 37 of
the 48 States) had increases of
6to 8 per cent. The four major
Pacific coast seaports, Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Port-
land and Seattle, showed gains
of 31 to 39 per cent. By con-
trast, the three largest eastern
cities (New York, Philadelphia
and Boston) had increases of
only 8 to 16 per cent.
Another striking feature is the
decrease by 2,700,000 in the
agricultural population since
1940. But —a fact equally
striking—not only has there
been no reduction in the output
of farm products since 1940 but
this actually has increased, a
tribute to mechanisation and
other improved farming
methods.
Driven Millions.
Publicity given since the war
to Europe’s “displaced persons”
makes them seem a fearful
enough horde of misery; but
they appear a mere handful to
their counterparts in Asia.
In India, after Britain pulled
out, N. Y. “Times” records,
“the number of Moslems flock-
ing from Hindustan into Paki-
stan and of Hindus and Sikhs
straggling from Pakistan into
Hindustan is estimated at
8,000,000, hundreds of thou-
sands of whom still lie where
they fell in communal
massacres.” And those numbers
in turn are small to China’s up-
rooted hordes.
An estimated 33,000,000 war
refugees, with another 15,000,000
fleeing floods and famine, make
up the picture of unimaginable
misery in China: “War refugees
from the northern provinces
alone more than equal half the
entire population of Pakistan,
Moreover, they constitute a
shifting population, unable to
settle anywhere. As the Com-
munists advance or retreat the
refugees are driven back and
forth like flotsam and jetsam on
a moving tide. Taxed and re-
taxed out of everything they
own, removed from productive
toil, miserable and demoralised,
these refugees descend like
locusts on towns and villages
already barely self-supporting.”
A long way from the one-time
American vision of a strong,
united China that was to emerge
after the war.
Russia Accuses.
Replying to the published
diplomatic documents exposing
the Russian guilt of conniving
with Hitler to start the war,
Moscow charged Britain and
France with having “brazenly
traded in other people’s terri-
tory,” referring, of course, to
Munich.
Commenting editorially on this
charge, N. Y. “Times” points
out that all through the negotia-
tions Britain had one aim—to
preserve peace. If, at Munich,
Britain and France traded in
other people’s territory “they at
least, in contrast to Stalin him-
self, demanded no part of
Hitler’s spoils.” Moreover, “un-
like Stalin, they did this ‘trading’
not in anticipation of war, but
to prevent war; and when
Hitler’s annexation of Czecho-
slovakia manifestly took the
question beyond any German
confines, they moved promptly
to stop him.”
On the further Russian charge
that Britain and France made
every effort to encourage Hitlers
aggression and direct it against
the Soviet Union, N. Y. “Times”
points out that, “far from
‘goading’ Hitler” to attack
Russia, Britain and France “put
up a bar against such an attack
in the East by giving a guarantee
to Poland, which they pledged
themselves to back with all their
power.
“They did more. They urged
Stalin to join in such guarantees
and thereby establish a system
of collective security which
would discourage even Hitler's
reckless ambitions. But when
Stalin’s collective-security propa-
ganda was put to this test it
turned out to be a sham. For
once the Western Allies had
committed themselves to go to
war against Hitler in case he
attacked Poland, Stalin turned to
Hitler and made the deal for the
partition, not only of Poland,
but of all Eastern Europe, which
meant war. That is a fact which
no Russian propaganda will be
able to wipe from the pages of
history.”
Communist Treason.
In a London “Times” letter,
Commander Robert Bower, who
won some fame or notoriety
during the war by opposing, with
others in Parliament, too-restric-
tive powers against individuals
being vested in any one man
(the Minister responsible in em-
ploying such powers), makes a
remarkable allegation regarding
Britain’s Corns.
Commander Bower opposes
a wholesale purging of Corns,
though admitting that “the fate
of one European country after
another has shown how danger-
ous a Communist minority oc-
cupying key positions in gov-
ernment or industry can be.”
He takes the (perhaps bene-
volent) view that “there are Com-
munists and Communists,” be-
lieving that “During the war the
senseless and indiscriminate adu-
lation of all things Russian, by
part of the press and certain of
our leaders who might have
known better, induced many
young people to join the Com-
munist party without knowing
what Communism was. In a
‘quiz,’ few of them would be
able to say what is meant by
Hegel’s dialectic of history, and
I have met one who vaguely
imagined that Karl Marx was
Groucho’s brother!”
Commander Bower then
adds: “There is little danger
from such poor dupes once they
and the public are thoroughly
enlightened, and surely the best
way to do this is, not by purging
small fry with the inevitable
resultant injustices, but by bring-
ing into operation the law of
treason, which provides ade-
quate safeguards. It is common
knowledge that evidence suffi-
cient to secure many convictions
has been in possession of the
authorities for years.
“Resultant trials would cause
a first-class sensation, held, as
they would have to be, in public.
The Rule of Law would be vindi-
cated in the eyes of the whole
world, and there would be
created in the country a climate
of opinion scornful of traitors
in which Communism as a dan-
gerous factor could not hope to
survive.”
Dragnet Digest.
Communism’s Dupes. —Labor-party
leader in the House of Commons
Herbert Morrison on the “political
philosophises”: “Let Socialist simple-
tons who urge co-operation with the
Communists take warning. Czecho-
slovakia proves that Communists are
enemies to Parliamentary or any other
kind of democracy, that they will
stoop to any depth of blackmail or
violence in their attempt to seize
power.” “Socialist simpletons” seems
accurate enough.
* * * *
U.N.O. Road to War. —As assessed
by a London “Times” letter-writer:
“The United Nations is a multilateral
treaty between sovereign Power units.
It is based on the principle of the
sovereign equality of nations, which is
the mathematical formula for war.
The United Nations is a society
within which sovereignty supreme
source of law —resides in the in-
dividual members of that society and
not in society itself. Such a state ot
affairs is anarchy. And where there
is anarchy, violence alone can settle
human conflicts.”
* * * *
Britain’s Confiscation Tax. —Refer-
ring to the capital tax in the British
Budget as “confiscation with a ven-
geance,” “Wall-street Journal ’ com-
mented: “Britain has taken another
step in its progression toward the
abolition of private capital and the
free-enterprise system. We have
never been deluded by the rosy theory
that this British Socialism could be
some middle road between a free
society and complete Statism. Once
a community embarks on the way of
State Socialism there is no stopping-
place short of complete oblivion for
individual economic freedom. The
obliteration of private capital in Eng-
land may come more slowly than in,
say, Russia, but it seems to be coming
just as relentlessly.” In such an
atmosphere, it adds, private capital
cannot long exist: “What can will
flee. What cannot will be swallowed
by the State, there will be no new
capital except what the State acquires
by taxing. And as private capital
dwindles the State must inexorably
levy more and greater taxes. What
can the end of such a progression
be but a society in which there is
nothing except what belongs to the
State?”
* * * *
Cold War Balance-sheet. —As sum-
marised by a “Wall-street Journal ’
correspondent: “The Soviet Union,
by a combination of military power
and fifth-column activity, has brought
under its domination the whole of
Europe up to the frontiers of Scan-
dinavia, Italy and Austria. It has
strong fifth-columns in France and
Italy, and has proved its ability to
retard reconstruction by Communist-
incited strikes and guerrilla warfare.
On the other side of the picture, the
United States has held the line m
Greece and Turkey. It can count
on much suppressed sympathy in the
lands under Soviet tyranny, and can
take satisfaction in the existence of
a movement toward West European
unity that would have seemed impos-
sible a year ago. It is not without
significance that there are hundreds
of thousands of refugees from Soviet-
dominated Europe in free Europe, and
there is no corresponding reverse tide.”

Vandenberg Unwilling. Whoever
finally gets the U.S. Republican Presi-
dential nomination, Senator Arthur H.
Vandenberg has been strongly tipped,
but has, according to “Christian
Science Monitor’s” chief Washington
correspondent, been genuinely most
unwilling: “Senator Vandenberg is
totally eschewing Presidential politics.
He asked Michigan Republicans
not to enter his name at the Phila-
delphia Convention. He means it.
He does not want the nomination.
He does not intend to seek the
nomination. He does not want his
friends to seek it for him. He wishes
to be completely free in spirit and in
mind to devote himself, unencumbered
by politics, to what he considers the
greatest service he can render the
nation —the European Recovery Pro-
gramme. Perhaps the Philadelphia
Convention ultimately may be finable
to resist nominating Senator Vanden-
berg, but it will get no help, no
encouragement, no connivance from
him.”
* * * *
Prosperous Swiss. —Being able to
stay neutral can return fair dividends;
a special correspondent of N. Y.
“Times” has this to report on present
Switzerland: “The simple facts or
normality and prosperity in this
country are sensational. Switzerland
is so normal it’s abnormal. It is still
a land of hot water, clean linen and
plenty of good food. After the
grimness of Vienna it is almost a
shock to wake up in this pre-war
fairyland of bright sun on snow,
sleigh-bells and people skiing.”
* * * *
Canada’s Com Outlook. —As re-
ported by London “Times” Ottawa
correspondent: “It is recognised that
Communists, in Canada as elsewhere,
aim at destroying the present form
of the State in the interests of Marxist
philosophy, and the conviction is
growing that any interpretation ot
political freedom that embodies the
right to undermine the State is folly.

Trieste Dying, Anyway. —A Lon-
don “Times” correspondent on the
spot reports Trieste to be “a dying
city, of little economic value to either
Italians or Yugoslavs.” Its rehabili-
tation, the correspondent adds, win
present the Italian Government with
a difficult problem. Trieste “was
built as a sea outlet for the land-
locked Austro-Hungarian Empire, but
today, after the sweeping changes ot
two world wars, it has outlived its
usefulness as a shipping and hading
centre. Nowadays the States which
succeeded the old Empire are an
within the orbit of a Communist-
planned economy, which does all
trading through Government agencies,
. without the help of wholesalers, ship*
ping agents, or bonded warehouse
The mere unloading and trans-
shipping of Government-ordered buiK
cargoes may provide employment t
a number of stevedores and pon
officials, but will not bring back the
lost prosperity. There is no doub
that in the future the city will not b
able to support its present number o
inhabitants.” To which Italians w
say that all that has nothing to
with the case, as would any.other
people regarding a bit of their o
native heath.

SOCIALIST FALSE WITNESS.
“Go for your life,” the cry of an inter-
jector to Mr. Chifley at his referendum
meeting at Sydney Town Hall, just about
expresses the situation. For the Canberra
Socialists it is neck or nothing. Without
their Bank Grab scheme—steadily mov-
ing towards the people’s judgment at the
1949 general elections, a situation which
the Chifleyites have tried to avoid-Mhen
referendum bid next week for regimen-
tation of industry by Canberra must, for
sake of “socialisation in ten years,” be
urged on the country at all risks.
The plea offered by Mr. Chifley, Dr.
Evatt and their fellow-Socialists is
specious from start to finish. They are
not free agents, and so far as they have
expressed any principles in war-time
prices-control they have abandoned them.
They are merely obeying the behests of a
trades-union council, the “mimicking
Molotovs” who (in accordance with the
“ten-year socialisation” plan) are bent on
replacing Parliamentary government by
government under the A.C.T.U., a Com.-
infested body.
The demonstrable falsity of Mr.
Chifley’s statements in his opening broad-
cast and at his Sydney public meeting
(Dr. Evatt there endorsing them) covers
a considerable list:
“Commonwealth price-control costs each
Australian exactly a halfpenny a week.”—
In truth administration costs nearly a mil-
lion a year, and subsidies for “price-stabili-
sation,” estimated for 1947-48 at £26 mil-
lions, will reach £42 millions before the year
is out. That makes about £6 a head per
annum, nearly half-a-crown a head per
week, not half a penny.
“If the referendum is lost the whole price-
fixing structure would vanish and the Com-
monwealth could not pay those subsidies.”
—The subsidies include payments to pro-
vide luxurious wage-rates, extra holidays,
amenities, etc., for coalminers and seamen,
basic-wage subsidies, £7 million to small
farmers to offset higher-wage and shorter-
week costs, plus another £4.3 millions for
potatoes and milk. Coal subsidies alone
have risen to nearly double the Budget
estimate. Does Mr. Chifley. say that
only a “Yes” vote at the referendum will
enable him to subsidise this “Golden Age”
for coalminers and seamen, to mention only
two groups benefiting from his false wage-
structure?
“The States cannot do the job, and their
legislation for exercising controls has ex-
pired.”—Not only can the States do the
job as they did before the Chifley era, but
they are demanding to do it and have
legislation passed or drafted to do it. In-
deed, some controls, including those over
building materials and bus and taxi fares
(being “difficult”), have been handed back
to the States. Rent controls never were
taken over from South Australia and Wes-
tralia.
And that does not exhaust the recital of
humbug from the head of the Common-
wealth Government.
Mr. Chifley sacrificed to the unions
his own price-control system as in-
stituted in war-time. From 1945 till
mid-1947 he insisted on wage-pegging,
as in war-time, as an essential part
of price-stabilisation—which it is. Upon
nothing was he more emphatic than
that. Then in July, 1947, the unions made
it plain that either he did his stuff as
“the movement” required or he must go.
The A.C.T.U. carpeted him and demanded
the unpegging of wages and the strictest
continued pegging of all goods produced
by wages. This was to be the second
step, following the Bank Grab move, to-
wards Socialist control of industry. Pri-
vate employment, forced to absorb all
rising costs (primary and secondary)
from increased wages, would be frozen
out. Mr. Chifley surrendered; and be-
cause the system administered by the
Prices Commissioner is by this means
leading to the hobbling of industry, the
whole scheme is drifting into anarchy.
That, and not the reversion of price-fix-
ing to the State Governments (where it
constitutionally belongs), is the condition
making for the chaos with which the
Chifleyites are trying to frighten the
electors.
The inflation Mr. Chifley pictures as a
“No” voters’ bogy' is real, present and
spreading. No pegging of prices of com-
modities alone can stop it. The British
Socialist Government, slightly deeper than
our own Socialists in this mess, recently
was obliged to put in a peg against rising
wages again, as every intelligent elector
must have noted. The Chifley Govern-
ment, if it continues present controls, will
inevitably have to do the same.
Tiff the A.C.T.U. issued its injunctions
on price-control Ministers spoke very
differently about it. Dr. Evatt, de-
fending his Defence (Transitional Provi-
sions) legislation, said in Parliament:
The position is, and the Minister for
Post-war Reconstruction has it in hand,
that the Government will carry out its in-
tention of .reviewing those controls so that
practically all of them will be relaxed at
the end of the year [1947].
That Minister is the same Mr. Dedman
who now discovers that the Government
was at the 1946 elections given “a blank
cheque” and can, as the interjector said
at the Sydney Town Hall meeting, “go
for its life.”
Mr. Chifley says now that, if his Gov-
ernment is given permanent control over
prices in place of the temporary (transi-
tional) powers which he was going to
taper-off last year and the year before, he
will still relinquish them at the first oppor-
tunity. Does anybody trust him on that
assurance? He says all he wants is a re-
serve power, for use when he (or the
A.C.T.U.) thinks he should use it. Why,
the whole socialisation objective of the
“Labor” party was a “reserve” objective
till Mr. Chifley suddenly brought it out of
cold storage with his Bank Grab Bill.
Are the electors going to allow him “re-
serve powers” after that experience?
Mr. Chifley said at his Sydney meeting
that a “Yes” vote would not advance
“Labor’s” socialisation platform at all. His
words in his opening radio broadcast the
day before must therefore be numbered
among the “blazing indiscretions” of poli-
ticians. He then said:
Price-control could only be used to
socialise industry by fixing unpayable prices
which would drive private enterprise out of
production.
Quite so; “on and on,” as Mr. Pollard
chants, “in the socialistic manner.” That
is the policy—private enterprise being
anathema to these Socialists —and the
unions which command this “Govern-
ment” have expressly said so. The ac-
cepted programme for “socialisation in
ten years” it. Mr. Chifley’s un-
necessarily oppressive taxation maintained
since the war assists it. The power to
fix all “charges”—such as interest, says
Mr, Chifley—is calculated to achieve any-
thing which the Courts may prevent Mr.
Chifley’s doing with his Act to suppress
the trading banks.
The country electors particularly, by
voting “Yes,” would be placing them-
selves in thrall to a bureaucracy ndw,
through Ministers, seeking to impose an
everlasting regime of form-filling official
dictation and “nationalisation” of their
produce, bought for any price the central
Government likes to name, and sold for
any price in the market which the same
Government may obtain. There will be
armies of inspectors policing price-con-
trol in all industries, rural, manufactur-
ing or distributing. The gods before
whom any appeal or protest must be de-
livered will be distant as well as, in
the nature of gods, deaf. If wheat is
worth up to a pound a bushel and Can-
berra wants to grant some favor to a
purchaser by selling it for ss. 9d., that
will be continued under price-control. If
some small country or suburban store-
keeper, confused in a maze of directions,
chances to charge for some article a
penny over some bureaucrat’s latest re-
vised idea of its price he becomes a
criminal, liable to be haled before a Court
and heavily fined. And if he votes “Yes”
on May 29, when he might strike for
freedom by voting “No,” he will have
brought his trouble on himself.
Even Mr. Lang, speaking in the House
of Representatives five months ago, has
protested;
This codification of our daily lives has
resulted in the taxpayer carrying an in-
verted pyramid of bureaucrats, all clinging
to their emergency powers, and all trying
to hang on to a war that is over. This
bureaucracy is growing daily. It is attempt-
ing to centralise all power, and all controls,
in this city of red-tape.
Any case made out for the continu-
ance of price-control becomes in itself
damning evidence of the administrative
failure of the Canberra Socialists and
of their domination by the industrial
anarchists of the A.C.T.U, —both have
contributed to our failure to produce
consumer-goods and homes adequately—
while the request for more centralised
controls is partly political desperation, but
largely the thirst for power by a crowd
whose ambitions and envies are out of all
proportion to their governmental capa-
city and sense of democratic responsi-
bility.
The Coll to the Country.
It was reserved for the A.B.C. news ser-
vice—rather surprisingly, for that very
expensive “Labor” improvisation is deeply
concerned, even more so than the good-
as-“Labor” press, with the sayings and
doings of city “Labor” politicians, par-
ticularly Mr. Calwell and Dr. Evatt —to
announce the arrival in Sydney of two
Townsville residents with a report of ill
omen for “Labor.”
One of the visitors is a doctor
and the other a Chamber of Commerce
man. They emphatically declared that
North Queenslanders had been strongly
moved by the Communist outrages to
which they had been subjected by Com-
munists operating from Brisbane and
Sydney (in one notorious case from Mel-
bourne), and by the indisposition of one
“Labor” Government and the incapacity
of the other to protect them. They
agreed that New State feeling was wide-
spread, and that ‘it would take little to
get a movement going.”
Prices-and-charges referendum cam-
paigners have formed the same opinion, of
Central Queensland as well as the North.
They confess themselves astonished at the
size and tone of the meetings they have
addressed. Mention of Mr. Hanlon’s
resistance to the Communist blockade of
Queensland, to which Canberra surren-
dered, as it has surrendered since Sep-
tember, 1945, to the Communist veto on
trade and commerce with the N.E.1.,
brings cheers, for courage in emer-
gencies, by whomsoever shown, is
admired by all Australians, whatever
their party preferences. But the chefers
have been subdued since Mr. Hanlon
began to support the permanent transfer
of the prices-and-charges power to Can-
berra, and, along with the feelings aroused
by the Canberra politicians—contempt
for their weakness whenever and wherever
Communists thrust themselves into the
picture, concern at their pretensions—the
old hostility to Brisbane neglect and spas-
modic meddling is reasserting itself.
Provincial self-government, based on
the conviction that Brisbane knew little
and cared less about the outlying parts
of a colony greater in area than any
State of the American Union, is an old
aspiration in Central and North Queens-
land. At the Federial Convention of
1901, as Ulrich Ellis records in his New
Australian States, Thomas Mcllwraith
said “We shall require some guarantee
that Queensland is going to be recognised
as three provinces in this new
Federal Government, and we must
provide some method by which the sub-
division of a colony can be made.” Mc-
Ihvraith was then Samuel Griffith’s Trea-
surer, and Griffith headed the delegation ;
the other members were John Macross&n,
Donaldson, Rutledge, Thynne and Mac-
donald-Paterson. Six years later William
Kidston, afterwards the Premier, got a
Parliamentary majority for a resolution
in favor of a referendum of the districts
desiring separation, though nothing came
of it. In November, 1898, a separation
petition signed by 25 central and northern
members was sent to Joseph Chamberlain,
then Secretary for the Colonies; the
petitioners undertook to seek incorpora-
tion in Federated Australia should their
prayer be granted. An Ellis note and pre-
diction :
Chamberlain replied that it would be
better for the separationists to await the
consummation of Federation and to seek
the boon from the new Commonwealth.
Thus ended the movement for the time
being, but the day is not far distant when
Central and Northern Queensland will chal-
lenge Brisbane again, not because of their
weakness but because of their strength.
Ellis’s book was published in 1933.
After events which he could not foresee,
his prophecy is now in a fair way to ful-
filment, though the challenge must now be
aimed at Canberra more than at Bris-
bane.
That challenge has become necessary.
Necessary to safeguard the liberties of
North and Central Queenslanders, to pro-
tect their industries, injured by Communist
wreckers (“a third of the cane crop will
be lost if shipping of sugar overseas
continues at the present rate”) and
to assert their self-governing rights
as citizens of what was intended
to be a Federal Commonwealth, now
itself in a variety of ways—the latest,
increase of Federal members, which will
place permanent power in the hands of
city chaps principally from Sydney and
Melbourne —in deadly danger. Actually,
as well as relatively, North and Central
Queensland, and, of course, New Eng-
land and Riverina, have populations
greater than some of the American States
taken into the Union in the last 80 years
or so —for example, Nevada, with 30,000
inhabitants, in 1864, and Arizona,
with 205,000, in 1912 —and they dwarf
Alaska, whose admission to Statehood has
been recommended by President Truman
to a willing Congress, though at a census
taken in October, 1941, Alaska had only
72,500 people, of whom 39,000 were
whites and 30,000 “native stock” —
Eskimos, Red Indians and Aleuts.
New York, “the Empire State,” sends
45 Representatives and two Senators to
Congress ; 47 out of 531. Pennsylvania,
next in order of population, has 33
Representatives and two Senators —no
State has ever had more than two. If
“Labor” can get away with its latest racket
the two States from which Mr. Chifley and
11 of his 18 Ministers come, and which
shelter their masters in industrial and
transport matters, the Communist Healy
(Waterside Workers’ Federation), Elliott
(Seamen’s Union), Brown (A.R.U.),
Thornton (Ironworkers), Thomson (Build-
ing Trades) and the rest of the gang, will
have 100 members (20 Senators and 80
Ms.H.R.) out of 182, and most of them
will be city members.
What is in store for North and Central
Queensland, and for New England and
Riverina, if this monstrous concentration
of power is consummated? Of a cer-
tainty, trouble in ugly forms and the pos-
sibility of disaster. They can avert the
ugly, forms of trouble and the possibility
of disaster from themselves and the people
of other outlying parts only by joining in
a concerted movement, putting forth their
whole strength, to secure their own teams
of Senators and Ms.H.R. as representa-
tives of new States. If they do this they
will soon see “Labor’s” tail go down,
as it goes down every time Communists
roar; and when, with courage exerted
in their own good cause and placed at
the service of the nation, they gain what
they have an unassailable right to
demand, Ihey will have an honorable
place in our history as preservers of the
instrument of government which “Labor”
and its Communist allies would destroy.
"All Power Corrupts"....
The quotation is having quite a vogue
in Australia. It is set down in print and
uttered in private talks and public
speeches, often, it may be suspected, by
persons who never heard of Lord Acton,
much less read him, but who feel, how-
ever vaguely, that something has gone
out of the old free and decent Australian
way of life —that the country has an un-
conscionable multitude of masters, big
and little, and swarms with hard-faced
men on the make. Examples of corrupting
power are sometimes given by the persons
who quote. They could be given by the
thousand.
There has been an accompanying aban-
donment of the standards to which
Ministers of the Crown and Cabinets
traditionally had to conform.
In the Keane case the “Government”
at Canberra chose to let a dead colleague
remain under suspicion of having prosti-
tuted his Ministerial position for private
gain rather than have even the one Keane
transaction dragged into light—reluct-
antly, by “a very dear friend” —
probed at a public inquiry.
In the Ward case the “Government”
elected to keep the Minister in office,
though it must have been aware that he
was about to be accused in open court
by a former “Labor” member, subordin-
ate and bosom pal, of having prostituted
his Ministerial position for private gain.
He was denying the impeachment when
Sydney became the scene of meetings of
the South Pacific Commission, which the
Minister kept in office should have
attended as official guardian of all the
island natives whose welfare is a charge
on the Ministry of External Territories.
His permanent head was there, but had
to absent himself for a time to give evi-
dence in the case against his chiefs
former fellow-member, subordinate and
bosom pal.
In the base of Dr. Evatt, who must have
authorised the prosecution of Mr. Ward’s
right-hand man that was, and who was
charged by opponents with having been
a party to violation of the “Govern-
ment’s” own war-time regulations regard-
ing building additions and repairs, the
“Government” assumed its well-known
air of outraged virtue. Intemperate pre-
sentation of the case, apparently amount-
ing to overstatement, brought some sym-
pathy to Dr. Evatt. But the assertion
that the Department of War Organisation
of Industry had threatened to comb out
the challenging municipal council’s staff
if the council didn’t stop “harassing” the
Minister was ruled out of order by the
Speaker arid was never answered in Par-
liament.
The excesses and evils that have grown
up since, by the accident of a war, vast
powers were vested in an ever-growing
horde of officials who, laws to them-
selves, issue laws by the bushel
were foreseeable consequences of the
hasty and clumsy improvisation of the
worst form of government that Aus-
tralia has known. Under it the
hard-faced persons who did so well
out of the war continue their exactions
in time of peace. Land sharks and black-
marketeers abound, while heroes of the
island and desert campaigns are denied
shelter, and widows of thrifty bread-
winners are robbed of the difference be-
tween valuations fixed when invasion was
feared and fair current market prices for
their little properties. Bad people prosper,
and get what they want because of, as
well as in spite of, the ever-rising pyramid
of regulations. Good people are pushed
around and subjected to endless depriva-
tions. Yet “Labor” politicians expect
good people to forget that “absolute
power corrupts absolutely” and vote for
a permanent establishment of the tyranm
that scourges them.
The audacity of these elected persons
is equalled only by the audacity of their
non-elected instruments.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Eddie and Jock Testify.
Crown counsel’s prediction that the de-
fence in the Garden case would take the
line that Minister Ward was the villain
of the piece was borne out when accused
—the Minister’s former “liaison officer,”
fellow-alderman, fellow-member, A.L.P
branch president at Darlinghurst (scene
of the trial and in the Ward electorate),
and medium of communication with con-
stituents and others —went into the box,
as he did on Thursday.
That day, after legal argument, Judge
Stacy directed the acquittal of Garden
on two of the three counts: (1) forgery
and (2) fraudulent falsification of a letter
“issuable by the Department of External
Territories” dated November 20, 1945.
His Honor said that a document which
contained false information did not con-
stitute forgery as defined by the Com-
monwealth Crimes Act, “even if written
on official paper,” and held that there was
no evidence to go to the jury. Mr.
Isaacs argued that this ruling should be
extended to the third count —forgery of
a letter dated November 10, 1947, ad-
dressed to the Minister of External
Territories and signed H. G. Forshaw —
but the Judge was against him: “I hold
that there is evidence to go to the jury.”
Examination and cross-examination
of Ward, of James McAdam (Acting-
Secretary of Forests in Papua) and of
J. R.. Halligan (permanent head of the
External Territories Department) preceded
the closing of the case for the Crown.
Under cross-examination Ward ad-
mitted that he had “promulgated” a
back-dated New Guinea ordinance which
benefited a nephew’s widow (“It had that
effect, but that was not the sole pur-
pose”), and there were other brisk pas-
sages :
Mr. Isaacs: You have sworn that you
didn’t know till December 15, 1947, that
Forshaw was connected with Hancock and
Gore [the Queensland concern alleged to
have paid £50,000 for *a timber concession
it never got]?—Yes.
In a letter written on December 10, 1947,
to Forshaw, of Hancock and Gore, the
name Forshaw appears in your writing?—
Yes. Garden, after trying to think of
Forshaw’s private address, said to send it
to Hancock and Gore’s, where it would
find him. I then wrote the name and
address in the comer.
Mr. Isaacs: The letter reads, “Dear Mr.
Forshaw, Regarding the interview you
had with me on Saturday concerning the
desire of your firm to commence timber-
getting operations in the Territory, I desire
to advise you that the matter fs receiving
attention.” The concluding part is abso-
lutely untrue, isn’t it? —Yes. “Receiving
attention” is a usual term used in reply to
correspondence addressed to a Minister or
member. It does not necessarily mean that
the matter is receiving immediate attention.
Accused swore that Ward was, in
effect, a member of the syndicate, with
Garden’s son Harcourt as Ward’s
dummy. A 1944 letter addressed to Ray
Parer stated that an application for a
Bulolo timber lease had been approved:
“the signature, ‘E. J. Ward,’ was Ward’s.”
The letter was not produced. Farrell,
Garden proceeded, said to him he
would “give Ward 20 per cent, of what
we receive.” In December, 1945, Farrell
gave him (Garden) £SOOO in 10-pound
notes wrapped in a brown-paper parcel,
which, on Ward’s instruction, he (Garden)
handed to Bill Urquhart on the Newtown
bridge, saying “Eddie told me to give you
this,” to” which Urquhart replied “I’ll be
seeing Eddie tonight; that will be all
right.” To Ward he (Garden) said on
the following Saturday “Did that arrive
all right?” The reply was “0.K.”
As for the letter of November 10,
1947, subject of the sole remaining charge,
Garden said it contained references to
Hancock and Gore, and “the Minister
had instructed me to keep references to
Hancock and Gore out of the corre-
spondence”; So “I redrafted the third
page, deleting mention of Hancock and
Gore, and had it typed by one of the
girls in the office. When Ward returned
to Sydney he read it and said it would
be all right. I then signed Forshaw’s
name, and made it look like his signa-
ture, in the presence of the Minister.”
A severe cross-examination of Garden,
in the course of which accused admitted
that he had “got £SOOO out of the first
£12,500, in the form of a bank cheque
endorsed with the words ‘£2500 to H.
Garden, £2500 to J. S. Garden,’ ” was
in progress when this page had to go
to the printer.
"Free" Medicine-boozing.
For 1947 “free” medicine in N.Z. cost
£1,439,686. In a population of about
1,800,000 there were written 5,882,000
prescriptions for the year at an average
cost of 4s. B|d. each. Comparative
figures for 12 months in Australia would
be something like 25 million prescriptions,
costing about £6,000,000. McKenna’s
optimistic figure is £2,000,000.
The B.M.A. in N.Z., alarmed at the
spread of medicine-boozing, suggests that
“some proportion of the cost should fall
directly upon the patients, in order to
impose a restrictive influence.” It reports
that consumption of drugs has been enor-
mously encouraged by “free medicine,”
and that the N.Z. people are “being con-
verted into a nation of drug-conscious
hypochondriacs.” Women go round
seeking out a doctor who will give them
“the prescription they like,” presumably
destroying the disfavored prescription or
medicine or both. They are, of course,
“free” to do that, too,
Chifley and McKenna can’t say they
haven’t been warned.
No Guts, No Gas.
Less than a fortnight ago, there being no
obvious signs; of trouble on the horizon,
N. S. Wales “Labor” Premier McGirr
came out fighting, or at least talking.
The occasion was just before the Coogee
(N.S.W.) by-election, and the N. S. Wales
Wonder was commenting on a remark by
the visiting Victorian Premier, Hollway,
about blackmarket cement. Mr. McGirr
sounded off:
I would take action tomorrow if I knew
cement blackmarketing was going on here.
And that from the Premier of a State
in which there is more blackmarketing
than in the rest of the Commonwealth,
and in which everything from homes and
cars to smokes and beer change hands at
fancy prices while racketeers wax fat.
Judging McGirr and his mob on past
form rather than present words, how-
ever, the voters at Coogee rejected the
“Labor” candidate in preference for a
young Liberal ex-serviceman, whereat
McGirr squealed like a baconer at the'
first touch of the knife. That was more
like his form.
Last Saturday N. S. Wales electors
would have appreciated some of the
“action” Mr. McGirr talked about a
week earlier. Without warning gas em-
ployees summarily downed tools because
they weren’t satisfied with the award of
one of the Conciliation Commissioners,
appointed at £ISOO a year each under Dr.
Evatt’s plan to bring a beautiful peace to
industry. The strike was so sudden
—so deliberately vicious—that many
housewiyes found themselves with
food half-cooked. Deprived of their most
essential household commodity, over
1,000,000 Sydney people ate cold meals
on a bitterly bleak week-end or, in a
biting westerly wind, got chills and sore
eyes tending backyard fires and other im-
provised cooking arrangements. Small
children and the sick in hospitals de-
pending on gas were particular sufferers.
Unemployment soared.
It was a wonderful opportunity for Mr.
McGirr to apply some of the “action”
he had been talking about a week earlier,
but The Wonder “was not available for
comment,” presumably having scuttled up
a hollow log at the first sign of trouble.
He was heard from 36 hours later: “I’ve
sent an urgent telegram to Mr. Chifley.”
Mr. Cahill, the Minister for Works
and Local Government, explained the
Government’s position with wonderful
clarity:
He [Cahill] said it was the company’s
responsibility to supply gas, and all his
department could do was to ration gas
if the Australian Gas Light Cos. had in-
sufficient supplies. However, as it had no
supplies at all, he could do nothing, Mr.
Cahill said.
After that Mr. Cahill “left Sydney and
could not be reached for comment.” Pre-
sumably he, too, had found a hollow log.
If McGirr and his crowd had a frac-
tion of the courage of Victoria’s Holl-
way or Queensland’s Hanlon they would
have been on the necks of these par-
ticularly miserable strikers as soon as the
thing started. But Hollow Log Govern-
ments haven’t the guts for that sort of

Squandering Dollars.
Adelaide “Advertiser’s” Canberra man,
who doesn’t waste his paper’s space by
buttering-up the Chifley crowd, is mighty
curious about the “extraordinary secrecy”
surrounding Commonwealth dollar ex-
penditure on the maintenance of diplo-
matic and other official staffs abroad.
From the Government’s point of view it
is one of the good features of the Federal
Budget that it gives no real clue to how
heavily Australia is drawing on the dollar
pool for Government spending.,, .It is
even probable that the Government has no
complete knowledge of what its dollar ex-
penditure really is.
After which the “Advertiser” man looks
over some of the spending for himself:
Dollar expenditure by the Department of
External Affairs can be deduced with fair
accuracy... .That of Information and other
minor departments which, for some reason
or other, have been given the right of direct
and often lavish representation abroad, is
completely concealed... .There is no trace
of what staffs Information employs abroad,
and what they cost... .More public servants
have gone to America on one pretext and
another this year The Washington Em-
bassy is estimated to cost $500,000 —five
times the cost when Mr. Casey was there.
....There are consuls, trade commissioners
and information offices in New York and
San Francisco, information offices in
Canadian cities legations in Chile and
Brazil for the sole purpose of beating-up
support for Australian delegations at inter-
national conferences.
Remarking that “there is little evidence
of any real response to last year’s order
to cut down overseas expenditure,” the
Adelaide man notes that “drastic and
often crippling restrictions are being im-
posed on private dollar spending.” And
this is the crowd which, though unable
to control its own spending, is asking for
power to control wages, prices, rents,
interest and everything else on May 29.

his hands down, crouches helpless against the
ropes. In another newspaper photograph
Treasure is pictured slumping to the floor under
the impact of a blow on the back delivered
with Patrick’s other fist.
A bqxing reporter wrote that “Patrick rained
blows bn the back of the neck when Treasure
was stricken on the middle rope.” Another
noted that Treasure was “retching violently”—
as a result, his trainer said, of severe body
punishment administered during 35 minutes.
A third suggested that the winner might have
extended mercy, seeing that he was certain of
a decision on points and that he himself be-
came a hospital case after a fight with a negro,
and must have known of a similar sequel to a
bout between “preliminary” boys. Treasure did
not end up in the hospital or the cemetery.
But “ambulance men administered first aid,
and it was several minutes before he was
carried to his dressing-room on a stretcher.”
Patrick is' nearly 28 and was champion, hav-
ing had 27 professional bouts, when Treasure
was a schoolboy; and he is also heavier and
longer in the reach. Treasure is 20. A negro
of the same age, Baroudi, was borne dying
from the ring at Akron, Ohio, on February 21
in consequence of 'fearful head and “rabbit-
killer” punches rained on the hapless novice
by a challenger for the light-heavyweight cham-
pionship, Charles. A week later another 20-
year-old negro, Decatur, “fighting his first pro-
fessional bout,” was slugged to death in a
fight at Hollywood. Several references to the
Baroudi affair have appeared in cablegrams
published in Sydney, the latest being a warning
issued by the manager of another negro matched
with Charles —he would see that the criminal
law was invoked if his lad were killed by foul
punches. These communications had no in-
fluence on the promoters who signed up Patrick
and Treasure, or on the referee who saw
unmoved what even a Sydney Stadium crowd
hooted.
“Labor” personages were among the wit-
nesses. The presence of Mr. Ward and other
“Labor” Ministers at Stadium fights is obsequi-
ously recorded by radio “commentators.” Other
“Labor” politicians who have apparently fallen
out with the Stadium management, for reasons
undisclosed, have been heard to suggest the
appointment of a boxing commission. It would
be useless except as a means Of providing jobs
and fees for supporters of Our Party. The U.S.A.,
where ring ruffianism and slaughter are rife —
for Baroudi and Decatur were only two of a
number of victims this last year—is stiff with
boxing commissions. The one in New York
is often the subject of shattering articles, and
as for its referees, “the only qualification de-
manded is a grey shirt, grey flannel pants, a
black bow-tie and a letter from your district
leader” (Lewis Burt in the New York “Journal-
American”).
The protection of pugilists, at every point of
their dangerous calling where they can be pro-
tected, is a matter for the police. It is, of
course, impossible for the police to bring in
compulsory insurance of boxers, which “Labor”
carefully excluded from its workers’-compen-
sation measure, but they could insist on proper
instruction and training of lads —now often
flung into the ring raw and unfit —prevent out-
rageous matchmaking and intervene if a referee
permits brutal and dangerous punishment of a
beaten man, as a police-inspector did when
Burns (still alive), his face a bloody mask,
swollen to double its natural size, was being
knocked silly by Johnson. And the police
ought to do this if only because boxing is part
of the curriculum in their boys’ clubs, from
which professional pugs increasingly emerge.
POLITICAL POINTS
After a week of confused argument
with the champion double-crossers at
Moscow, who published the substance of
a confidential statement of American
policy, and affected to believe that it
amounted to a humble appeal for a con-
ference, 'Washington gave hasty recog-
nition to Israel, “the new Jewish State.”
It is given out that Canberra will follow
suit. Nothing could be more ominous
for the Palestine Jews. The brand of
fatality is on everything Dr. Evatt
touches. Whether as Minister of External
Affairs or Attorney-General, whether it
is partition, “streamlined arbitration” or
a constitutional referendum, all his offer-
ings have the quality of Dead Sea fruit.
Beer was turned on in Sydney at the
week-end, after a 10 weeks’ strike of
brew'ery hands, and on Sunday, with the
thermometer at its lowest for the year,
gas was turned off. Each strike was
ordered in contempt of Dr. Evatt’s
“streamlined arbitration,” the only effect
of which, apart from adding about
£lOO,OOO a year to the already monstrous
cost of “government,” has been to make
“militant” unionism look more like selfish
and brutal larrikinism than ever. On
Monday, another bleak day, hospital
matrons were wondering how many of
their patients would die before the gas
came on again.
Mr, Macmahon Ball, having made his
peace with Dr. Evatt by a series of suit-
able A.B.C, broadcasts, is to head a
“goodwill mission” to Malaya, Burma,
Java, Indo-China, the Philippines and
“possibly” Siam. No mention of North
Borneo or the Eastern Indonesian Re-
public, neither of which has a Communist
nucleus —indeed, both were loyal to the
Dutch and the British during the war.
Nor is it proposed that the chief mission-
ary should ginger up the “goodwill
mission” by giving readings from Cal-
well’s speeches about Asiatics, Tongans
and Maoris. He is to “arrange for the
selection of 25 students for training in
Australian universities.” The universities
are ail overcrowded, but no doubt the
Marx school would find room for the
“students.”
Comrade Brown, of the Victorian
A.R.U., is in training for the world’s
skipping championship. Comrade Rowe
(A.E.U.) may challenge him or elect to
seek fame as an Olympic sprinter. In
either case Premier Hanlon would be pre-
pared to sign his nomination paper.
A.B.C. reports Cardinal Spellman as
saying, in a well-meant warning to Aus-
tralia, to look to its cradles, that births
are exceeded by deaths. There is some-
thing radically wrong in statement or re-
port. The last (and always belated) issue
of the Official Year-Book shows that the
number of births in 1945 and 1946
(160,560 and 176,406) vastly exceeded
the number of deaths (70,231 and 74,661),
Rates based on 1000 of mean population
were: Births, 21.77 in 1945 and 23.68 in
1946; deaths, 9.52 in 1945 and 10.02 in
1946.
“S. M. Herald’s” man in Cairo asked
“taxi-drivers, hotel porters, waiters,
tradesmen and clerks” what they thought
about Palestine. “The answer was a
vigorous shaking of the head and the
words ‘Bad, very bad,’ meaning that the
Jewish State seemed inevitable.” So
that’s what Marcellus meant when he
told Hamlet there was something rotten
in the State of Denmark.
McKenna, replying to doctors’ criti-
cism of his “formulary,” said the “Gov-
ernment” was prepared to consider sug-
gestions from the profession as to altera-
tions and additions. Whereat the B.M.A.’s
general secretary revealed that almost 12
months ago McKenna issued a similar
invitation, in response to which the
B.M.A. “conveyed to the Minister a
lengthy list of suggestions, additions and
omissions from the formulary.” The
published list showed that these had been
entirely ignored. There is nothing sur-
prising in that. “Labor,” regarding itself
as the fount of all wisdom, never takes
advice from people who know.
Dedman cast up at Mackay (N.Q.) to
blither for a Yes vote. He couldn’t have
chosen a more unfortunate time or place
—Forgan Smith’s old stamping-ground,
and it is not in Forgan’s nature to be a
Yes-man. So far from helping to fasten
on themselves permanently the ruinous
“controls” they have had from Canberra
and Communism this year, North Queens-
landers are moving for a State of their
own, and more power to their elbows!
A Sydney paper delightedly reported
that Helen Keller had said Melbourne
had a smell all its own. The wonderful
woman meant nothing derogatory, though
the Sydney reporter inferred otherwise.
Still, Melbourne hasn’t an odor to com-
pare with the one that emanated from
Sydney land-sales control and another
more recent and not to be analysed—
yet.
Canberra orders and communications
to and arrangements for wheatgrowers
always have something bitter in them.
While the farmers were still chewing over
the international agreement that was
readied-up without reference to them, and
Fadden’s charges that they’ve been done
out of £16,000,000, exclusive of what they
were done out of by the “prices-and-
charges” sale to N.Z. at ss. 9d., they were
informed by the Prices Commissioner
that bags are to be 2s. 3d. a dozen dearer.
Canberra doubtless considers that, since
they’re only its licensed employees, they
can economise by eating more rabbits.
In a telegram read to 10,000 people at
De Valera’s meeting in Melbourne,
Chifley conveyed regrets for his unavoid-
able (or avoidable) absence, but Clumsy
Cal well was there with bells on. And,
as far as he could, Clumsy Calwell com :
mitted his “Government” to anti-parti-
tion in Ireland, as Dr. Evatt committed it
to partition in Palestine, where the im-
mediate bloody sequel to the crazy
U.N.O. decision has now flamed into a
hideous war, Calwell said he “hoped
Mr. De Valera would live to see Ireland
free from sea to sea, with the 32 counties
governed by Parliament in Dublin.”
Heaps of Australians hope Calwell will
go there and take his chance with his
friends, instead of sooling them on from
a safe place 10,000 miles away.
Farmers, country milk factories, the
Dairy Farmers Co-op. and Fresh Food
and Ice are to benefit from the increased
price of milk slapped on by the McGirr
Cabinet; a ha’penny a pint on the retail
price. Vendors are to lose a ha’penny a
gallon, and they are talking strike. They
would do better to have their tit. for tat
with Squealer McGirr in the by-election
for Kogarah.
Strange failure of co-ordination in
Canberra’s Yes ranks:
At the Premiers’ Conference in 1946 the
Commonwealth offered to hand over to
the States responsibility for price-control
if the States would pass a fair-prices law.
— Rosevear.
To say the States could pick up the task
of price-fixing is a deliberate attempt to
mislead you. ihe State Premiers agreed
unanimously in 1946 to pass legislation
which would enable price-control powers
to be exercised try the Commonwealth for
as long as shortages of commodities con-
tinued. — Chifley.
It was Rosevear who jumped his chief’s
referendum-campaign gun with the
furphy about prices-control costing only
a ha’penny a head per week.
Canberra makes great play in the refer-
endum appeal with the way price of tea
would soar if controls were removed. Of
course, tea-control won’t be removed;
removal would automatically raise all
wage levels again, and so increase all
other prices and cost of all Government
services. But if Chifley hadn’t allowed
the Communist Waterside Workers’
Federation to ban trade with Java ever
since the war ended, one of the most im-
portant channels of the tea-import trade
would not have been closed, and tea
would not have soared to its outrageous
import price.
N.S.W. Liberal-leader Treatt got off a
neht crack at a referendum meeting:
In Britain the skies are black with Socialist
chickens coming home to roost.
So black are they that the Attlee Govern-
ment had to turn back on its tracks and
reintroduce wage-pegging in order to
check inflation and try to hold prices;
and the Chifley crowd will have to do the
same before long, whatever the A.C.T.U.
may lay down as Government policy. If
some of its supporters aren’t praying for
the alibi which a No vote would give
them then it’s because they are past pray-
ing.
The author of the Beveridge Plan and
his wife arrived in Sydney by plane when
the P.M. and his deputy were about to
“open” their prices-and-charges cam-
paign, and, in Lady Beveridge’s words,
“decided it would be a good opportunity
to hear some of your statesmen.” They
heard the “statesmen,” and presumably
read the opening sentences of the reports
in the morning papers;
“S. M. Herald.”
Cries of “Good on
you, Ben,” and “Go
for your life, son,”
greeted Mr. Chifley.
His enthusiastic audi-
ence filled the hall.
“Daily Telegraph.”
The hall was about
three-quarters full, and
Mr. Chifley was heard
without interruption.
Thus the morning brought compensation
for a disappointing night.
Alfred Edwards, “Labor” M.P. for
Middlesborough, damning “nationalisa-
tion” of the steel industry as “suicide”:
The civil service and efficiency are' a
contradiction in terms, ihe Government
talks about more powers because it doesn’t
know what to do with the powers it has.
This is exactly what some “Labor” mem-
bers at Canberra think of their own “Gov-
erment’s” plans for “nationalisation” and
“more powers,” but none of them has
the courage to say it.
Mikolajczyk, writing his memoirs, re-
called a conversation with Roosevelt in
June, 1944. The ailing President re-
marked that Stalin was not an imperialist
and that at Tehran he and Uncle Joe
had “got along famously; better, in fact,
than with Churchill.” It is always harder
to come to agreement with a man who
intends to stand by his promises than
with one who doesn’t even intend to re-
member them.
According to Premier Hanlon, the
Burdekin dam —estimated cost £4,400,000
—will hold as much water as Hume,
and so irrigate 250,000 acres and
supply hydro-electric power. That, with
Blair Athol and Callide Valley coal
development, is part of his election
promise to develop the North. Over the
southern border a “ ‘Labor’ Government”
which promised to build 90,000 homes
in three years has got as far as in-
vestigating the claim of an old humbug
who said he could cure cancer and going
into retreat without legislatively pro-
tecting stricken people against all such
humbugs.
Playford’s State had 646,216 people in
1947 compared with 580,949 in 1933.
Playford has told members of the Lib.
Country League he isn’t “happy”
about ihe figures, especially as there has
been a decrease of 5964 males and an in-
crease of 1385 females in rural areas in
14 years. In 1933 there were 975 more
males than females in S.A.; in 1947
5776 more females than males.
A Communist rag published in Sydney
is all out for Henry Wallace as Presi-
dent, Wallace is the man who, as Secre-
tary for Agriculture in the ’thirties, in-
vented the idea of paying farmers to
plough-in their crops and kill off their
young stock in order to halt falling prices.
Federal “Labor” imitated it when it paid
Westralian wheatgrowers £2,000,000 not
to grow wheat. In each case Nature
avenged itself.
In Australia, as in the U.S.A., an
ancient grudge has influenced a too-
complaisant attitude to Communists on
the part of Christian ministers and
writers, and Communists have exploited
the ancient grudge at union, Labor Coun-
cil and A.C.T.U. elections and meetings.
The wicked Communist blockade of
Queensland is effecting a cure.
Giving their flocks a lead, the editors
of Queensland’s Presbyterian and
Methodist organs and the leading Bris-
bane Baptist preacher have come out
strong against the Communist conspiracy.
Wrote the Presbyterian editor:
The Communist issue is the greatest the
Church has had to face for 400 years;
compared with it the old contention be-
tween Rome and Geneva is a bagatelle
and the Golden Casket fiddlesticks.
Again:
A speaker at a mass meeting averred that
the trade-union movement did not inquire
about a man’s politics. That contention
will deceive no one except the man who
can carry a load of sawdust in his eye
without feeling it.
A neat and effective illustration.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Command of H.M.A.S. Sydney, our
new carrier—probably the most im-
portant naval appointment made recently
—goes to Captain R. R. Dowling, D.S.O.
He specialised in gunnery, but contrary
to the usual conception of the breed —
“all gate and gaiters”—Dowling is a
quietly refined officer whom the troops
speak of as “a thorough gent.” Before
1939 he served in Ramillies, Venturous
and Colombo, and he put in the early
part of the war patrolling Norwegian
waters and guarding Atlantic convoys as
executive officer of cruiser Naiad. A
rapid change of scene found Naiad
plastered with bombs in company with
cruiser Perth off Crete, where she was
severely damaged. Refitted, she joined
Vian’s force worrying enemy communi-
cations in the Med. One night in March,
1942, she ran into a torpedo and went
down. Returning to Australia, Dowling
had a merited rest ashore, and was
Deputy Chief of Naval Staff when he was
promoted to command’ cruiser Hobart,
refitted after torpedoing. On the way
north, after Hobart’s six-inchers had
covered a practice atoll eight miles away
with flung spray and coral, Dowling
broadcast over the ship’s speakers: “I am
now ready to take the ship into action.”
He did; bombarding Tarakan, Wewak,
Labuan, Balikpapan and taking part in
the Lingayen Gulf show. Hobart was
in Tokio for the signing. Back at Navy
Office after the war, Dowling applied
his gunnery knowledge to the Directorate
of Ordnance, Torpedoes and Mines, and
left for overseas specialist courses, pre-
sumably in carrier work, last February.
Hal Colebatch, defeated in the W.A.
Legislative Council elections a week or
so ago, has been part of the landscape in
Westralian public life for over 40 years.
A journalist who went in for politics—
in 1904 he edited a Perth daily and he
has been proprietor of the Northam
“Advertiser” for 43 years—he was a
member of the Legislative Council from
1912-23, held the portfolios of Justice,
Education and the North-West, and was
Premier for a brief period. After that
he had two long terms in London as
W.A.’s Agent-General, with five years in
the Senate in between. He returned to
Perth around about the time the war
broke out and before long was back in
the Council, At 76, he can’t be written
off as a back number; he married for
the second time three years ago and has
a toddler son.
The boxing-glove and portmanteau
adorning this Coventry sketch of Edgar
Tanner might suggest that he is going
OFF TO THE OLYMPICS.
abroad to make an attempt at the one-
hand boxing championship of Britain ;
actually he is off to London as manager
of the Australian team for the Olympic
Games, scheduled to open at the end of
July. These days Tanner’s connection
with sport is on the administrative side —
he has been secretary of the Australian
Olympic Federation since 1930—but
during the 1920 s he was very prominent
in amateur sport, particularly boxing and
wrestling. He had his first try-out as a
featherweight in 1924, and in the next 12
years fought 150 bouts and was beaten
only 11 times. He’s confident that Aus-
tralia will win some titles in this year’s
Olympics,
It is usually a risky business to claim
to be the sole survivor of this or the
only living man who did that, but if any
veterans of the Maori wars are still
capable of shaking hands with an old
comrade, 93-year-old Paul Creyton, of
Brisbane, would be pleased to meet them,
Creyton was only a youngster during the
desultory scrapping that ended in 1871,
but his knowledge of the country and
his fluency in the Maori tongue made
him a useful member of the Forest
Rangers, an irregular force organised by
a Polish soldier of fortune, Von TempskS,
who had gained his experience of guer-
rilla warfare in frontier fighting against
the American Indians. Creyton’s foster-
parents were actors, and after the war
he embarked on a stage career, touring
Britain, India and U.S.A. with Dion
Boucicault. Later he played with Ben
Holt, father of Bland, and George Rig-
nold. Coming to Australia, he tried his
luck at mining, and worked on Ballarat,
Gulgong and Lambing Flat before sett-
ling in Queensland. Since 1913 he has
been associated with the W.E.A. in Bris-
bane ; he has been made a life member
in recognition of his services to the move-
ment.
Alan R. Ramsay, Victoria’s new
Director of Education, will be the first
man to be appointed to that post straight
from the ranks—he was headmaster of'
Melbourne High, where he was educated,
and was a pupil-teacher when he enlisted
as a gunner in World War One. He
returned a lieutenant and went back to
teaching until the Second War, in which
he gained the D. 5.0., C.B.E. and C.B.
and emerged a major-general after serving
in the Middle East and as G.O.C. Fifth
Division in New Guinea and New
Britain. Before taking up his new posi-
tion he will visit England, to study the
latest in education.
Melbourne High School, having lost
Major-General Ramsay as principal, ac-
quires another teacher distinguished out-
side education circles —W. M. Wood-
full, former Australian Test captain. One
of the most popular masters in the Vic.
Education Department, he has been
teaching at Upwey State School in the
Dandenongs. Son of a parson, he was
born at Maldon, from which town he
gets his second name, and, like his pre-
decessor, is an Old Boy of High.
Retiring from the N.R.M.A. secretary-
ship after 26 years, H. I. Johnson. His
story is the story of the association. In
1923 he suggested that the old National
Roads Association, whose main concern
was provision of State roads, should be
enlarged to cater for cars and motorists.
Since then he has seen the concern grow
from a membership of fewer than 500 to
100,000, for whom it provides emergency
road and touring service, maps, a techni-
cal car-inspection department, legal advice
and the largest motor-insurance business
in the Commonwealth. Born in Mac-
donaldtown and educated at Kogarah
State school, Johnson fought in Palestine
in the first scrap as a major of the Seventh
Light Horse, and commanded the Fourth
Cavalry Brigade in the years before the
next. His two sons are champion water-
men —Bob was senior and junior N.S.W.
surf champion last year and Terry holds
the junior still-water championship.
Week-end motorists provide plenty of
work for the N.R.M.A. breakdown ser-
vice, but if Johnson himself runs into
trouble at the week-end the organisation
can’t do a thing about it ; his hobby is
yachting on Port Hacking.
It is not given to many naval heroes to have
their name so intimately linked with a ship that
the one is scarcely ever mentioned without the
other, but the man depicted here by Prior is
one. Three years ago he was created Baron
Mountevans, but to most people he will always
be “Evans of the Broke.” When the time came
tor Admiral E. R. G. R. Evans to choose
himself a new name he recalled an ice-clad
peak in Antarctica which had been named after
him, and decided to return the compliment. It
was touch and go, because the British Museum
had also conferred his name on a torpedo-
EVANS OF THE BROKE.
headed tapeworm. Prior has sketched Mount-
evans against a background symbolising his
career. On the left is the peak named after
(and before) him; the destroyers breaking in
from the right are the artist’s suggestion of
what Broke and Swift looked like when, on
a dirty night in 1917, they met and defeated
six German destroyers—Broke rammed one and
her men went in with the bayonet against
German sailors who clambered aboard, killing
some and taking 140 prisoners. The bombers
are a reminder of Evans’s six years as Londen’s
Regional Commissioner for Civil Defence. Space
difficulties precluded inclusion in the picture
of other incidents in the Admiral’s career —
three years in command of the R.A.N.; terms
as C.-in-C. in Africa and at the Nore; a spell
in charge of the Fishery Protection Flotilla,
which took him up to the Arctic Circle; the
China station ; three years as Rector of Aber-
deen University and two years’ farming in
Canada. The tapeworm, too, has been omitted.
Lord Mountevans is now in Australian waters
on a leisurely trip in the Norwegian vessel
Torrens. He told a Bulletin man his most
thrilling experience was a toboggan-run—down
the Shackleton Ice-falls —a descent of 2000 ft.
in 20 minutes; his most awe-inspiring sight,
“London by firelight,” seen from Westminster
Bridge at the height of the blitz.
One of the exhibitors in the Catholic
centenary art exhibition at the Town Hall,
Melbourne, learnt painting in an unusual
studio —a British submarine in the North
Sea. He is Max Plate, ex-R.N.V.R. While
serving in a mother-ship to submarines
his commander suggested that he should
paint the crests, of lost submarines for the
wardroom, and that is how he began. He
had never painted before, but he bought
a threepenny box of paints and started.
The box was short of white paint, so he
went to the ship’s dispenser and begged
a tin of stomach-powder. He has since
gained a reputation as a painter in oils
in Sydney. His picture in the show is
“Sanctuary,” a pleasing study of Windsor
Castle.
Sol Green, dead at 80 in Melbourne,
was born in Whitechapel, London ; at 16
he landed penniless in Australia. He first
started shouting the odds on Victorian
country race-tracks. In 1886 he started
his bookmaking career in Melbourne, and
by 1914, when he gave the game up, he
was probably the best-known and most
respected ringman in Australia, as well as
a racehorse-owner and -breeder of sub-
stance. His Shipley stud, near Warrnam-
bool, had many imported sires;
among its best Comedy King, brought
out as a foal-at-foot, to win a Mel-
bourne Cup and sire two winners of it.
Sol Green dispersed Shipley to estab-
lish his Underbank stud at Bacchus
Marsh, expended vast sums on it and
then gave that up to start improving the
breed of cattle. He disposed of his money
almost as quickly as he made it, mainly on
philanthropic projects. One of the
biggest was the £50,000 Sol Green Trust,
founded to provide ex-servicemen with
homes in a model suburb near Sandring-
ham, Victoria, but his
annual cheque for £lOOO
used to turn up regularly at
Melbourne Town Hall to
provide blankets for the
needy. In 1943 he gave
£l5OO to buy blankets for
bombed - out families in
England. Last year he
handed £42,000 to five Mel-
bourne hospitals on behalf
of Jewish co-religionists,
and accompanied the gift
with an appeal to Aus-
tralians to rid themselves of
racial and religious bigotry.
Dr. Percy Jones, Ph.D.,
Mus. Doc., who had the big
job of organising and con-
ducting the musical side of
the Catholic Centenary
celebrations in Melbourne,
had the largest stage and the
largest audience ever as-
sembled for a play in Mel-
bourne when the morality
play, “No Mean City,” was
performed at the Caulfield
Racecourse the other Sun-
day. The stage was an im-
mense erection composed of
steel scaffolding poles, and
the audieqce exceeded
90,000. Shan Benson wrote
the play and Dr. Jones com-
posed the music. He comes
from John Brownlee’s birth-
place, Geelong, was edu-
cated at its Christian
Brothers’ College, but learnt
his music at the Propaganda
College, Rome, and in Dublin. While at
the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music at
the Vatican he gained a high papal award
for his researches into early liturgical
music. He has been choirmaster at St.
Patrick’s Cathedral since 1942 and Dio-
cesan Inspector of Music for Catholic
schools since 1940.
When A.N.A. handed over the running
of the Sydney-Vancouver air service, to
B.C.P.A. it passed on many of its highly-
trained staff, so that B.C.P.A. gets off to
a flying start in more ways than one.
General-manager Alec Barlow, Chief-
pilot John Bennett, and captains Harry
Moore, L. A. Lohse and J. Knowling
all have over 10,000 flying-hours to their
credit, some of them 14,000. Navigator
T. P. Fairway, hostess superintendent
Miss Barney 'Lalor and operational-
planning officer A. J. Moline all came
from A.N.A. Harry Moore, with 36
Pacific crossings to his credit, will be
senior route captain at Mascot; Lohse
goes to Honolulu in the same capacity.
W. R. Cade, at 65, gives up his con-
ductorship of the Adelaide Symphony
Orchestra, which he formed 12 years ago.
He was a familiar figure before that as
conductor at the Royal for the William-
sons, and in his time has conducted in
every State.
Into the Silence;
In Sydney, at 57, Richard Cobden, chairman
and managing-director of York Motors. A
keen racing man, he owned several good
horses, including Tranquil Star.
In Sydney, at 73, Thomas Herbert Kelly,
chairman of Perpetual Trustee Co. and direc-
tor of the Bank of New South Wales and
Tooth and Co. An Eton and Oxford man,
he was a fine amateur musician and took a
keen interest in sport.
In Melbourne, at 55, Brigadier K. A. Mc-
Kenzie, D. 5.0., who was in the first batch
of graduates from Duntroon and served in
both world wars. Two sons are graduates
of Duntroon.
Suddenly, at Port Adelaide, Charles Hayter,
secretary of the Port Football Club for many
years. Trainers and officials gave him a funeral
procession and a minute’s silence before the
start of the Port-Glenelg game.
In Melbourne, Reginald H. Chapman, marine
engineer for the Melbourne Harbor Trust for
the last 20 years and an engineer-officer of the
Royal Navy during the First World War on
anti-submarine and escort duties in the North
Sea and Mediterranean.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Cheers”: In the skeleton May Day
march in Brisbane the wharfies were
sauntering along at a pace almost as slow
as their usual working rate. The section
ahead of them drew away, leaving a gap
in the procession. The leader of the
watersiders called to those in front to
steady down a bit to allow the wharfies to
catch up. A bystapder offered good
advice: “Shake it up yourselves; you’ve
been going slow long enough,” What
was left of another Commo group
slouched along in silence. One of
them, noting others of his union on the
pavement, suggested plaintively: “Give us
a bit of a cheer, mate.” He got a sour
reply. “I can’t. I’m not financial.”
* * * *
“Gander”: An Adelaide man, mulcted
£2l 17s. 6d. in fine and costs for drunken
driving, has the consolation of knowing
that the charge must be about the most
unique ever brought in his city;
That he did, while so much under the
influence of intoxicating liquor as to be
incapable of exercising effective control,
drive a motor vehicle, to wit, a road-
roller.
Traffic police testified that the machine
was “proceeding erratically” and the
driver was swaying behind the wheel and
“just smiled when told to stop,” Nothing
was said about speed, but then a road-
roller at any speed is not a thing which
can be allowed to “proceed erratically,”
* * * *
“Kanimbla”: If there are many in Syd-
ney like a citizen I met in a barber’s-shop
it will be safe to predict that now beer is
on tap again there’ll be a sharp rise in
the rate of drunkenness. He pulled out
several notes held together by an elastic
band. “What I saved through the beer
strike,” he explained. “Going to buy
your wife a present?” another customer
asked. “Not on your life,” was the
answer. “I’m going to have a good old
booze-up when the pubs open again.”
* * ♦ * ...
“Curate’s Egg”: The risk of tannln-
poisoning at the hands of hospitable
housewives encountered by “Spoke-
shave’s” iceman (B. 28/4/’4B) recalls the
industrial hazard which made me quit my
depression job as grocer’s delivery man.
In accordance with long-standing instruc-
tions to dump old Mrs. Jones’s weekly
bran and pollard order in the downstairs
bathroom I bowled in. On this occasion
the tub held not the unused portion of
Mrs. Jones’s chook-food but the shapely
body of an immediately articulate flapper,
before whose squeals I fled in disorder.
Hastening up the stairs to assure Mrs.
Jones that my intentions were strictly
honorable I learned that the old lady had
her daughter and granddaughter staying
with her. My explanations were accepted,
and caused some amusement to the
women, who prevailed on me to accept a
cup of tea to restore my shattered nerves.
Just as I was breathing normally again
the same flapper, with very little more on
her than when I had surprised her in the
bath, walked into the kitchen. On dis-
covering my unexpected presence she be-
came hysterical. Without wasting further
words I hastened away. For my next
job I took on powder-monkeying, which,
despite my complete ignorance of ex-
plosives, was a darn sight safer.

“Jasby”: Hope “Spokeshave’s” iceman
with his “just had a quince” slogan (B.
28/4/’4B) doesn’t come in for the same
sort of suspicion / did. I heard the quip
about 20 years ago, and, improving on it,
as I thought, adopted as my stock reply
when offered that extra slice of cake or
cup of tea, “No, thanks, I’ve just had
watermelons.” For a few weeks I got
along very well. If an inquisitive girl
asked what it meant or wanted further
details, the drill was merely to repeat the
remark. But the crash came one night.
The party had been going along merrily
and I was feeling on good terms with all
the world and, in particular, myself.
Offered a sausage-roll I blithely quipped
“No, thanks. I’ve just had watermelons.”
Till then I had thought bridling was an
accomplishment possessed only by char-
acters in books, but when I uttered the
words my hostess definitely bridled. So
did every female within hearing. Think-
ing perhaps I had been misunderstood, I
began to repeat, “No, thanks. I’ve”
My hostess cut me short. “Please don’t
use that disgusting expression again,” she
said. “We all know quite well what it
"If I miss this putt I hope you'll pardon my language before your wife”
means. Mary Reilly told us.” I haven’t
used it since, but I would like to know
just what Mary told them.
* * * *
“Clio”: Queer house-names (B.
28/4/ 48)? I nominate “Goitre,” a cot-
tage I used to pass years ago. I don’t
know whether the name had reference to
the disease or whether the namer just
thought it was a pretty, euphonious word.
* * * *
“Suvic”: War-planes adorned with
imps and lovely ladies, plus a small bomb
for each raid, were a common enough
sight during the war, but an Australian
airman in England went one better. He
had an old car, and painted on its side was
an exuberant imp chasing a beauteous
nude. His successful sorties were repre-
sented by foaming beer-mugs; teacups
indicated part-successes.
* * * *
“Cag”: That spitting Chinese lady (B.
21/4/’4B) brought a recollection of the
Peace celebration I attended in Borneo
in 1945. I was seated with other
8.8.C.A.U. officers and Chinese nota-
bilities on a bamboo platform hung with
colorful banners. Before the speechi-
fying the hoi polloi pressed close to the
platform’s edge gazing at us with ex-
pressionless faces. But when the Chinese
chairman rose to deliver the opening
oration the front row of the crowd leaned
back with all its weight against those
behind, forcing them to give way, and
so provide a clear space between them-
selves and the platform. The reason for
this move was soon evident. The speaker
periodically punctuated his polished
speech with loud throat-clearing cul-
minating in an audible “plop” upon the
ground below the edge of the dais. The
faces of his hearers remained expres-
sionless.

“L.H.P.”: Melbourne saw an earlier
performance of “The School for Scandal”
than the Theatre Royal show of 1850,
mentioned by “Cauboy” (B. 12/5/’4B).
George Coppin presented it at the Queen’s
Theatre in June, 1845, on the second night
of his season, which opened with “The
Lady of Lyons.” The company included
Coppin, George Rogers and Mr. and Mrs.
Charles Young. The newly-built Theatre
Royal was opened on July 16, 1855 (not
1850) with Sheridan’s play with Rogers
(Sir Peter), Henry Neil Warner (Joseph),
Charles Poole (Charles) and Mrs. Charles
Poole (Lady Teazle). Some of the first-
night notices published have a touch of
comedy about them in retrospect. In the
absence of a transport commission to
disentangle the traffic knot the following
order was issued in the bill: “Carriages
—horses’ heads towards Russell-street.”
A hint of the reputation of theatres in
those days was conveyed in the statement
that “The Dress Circle will be kept rigidly
select,” and “respectable ushers have been
appointed.” Prices on the opening night
were 12s. 6d. to 2s. 6d. John Black, who
built the theatre, was a goldfields con-
tractor, and was said to have lost all his
money in the Royal. After a year he
retired in favor of George Coppin and
G. V. Brooke, who re-opened on June 7,
1856, with “She Stoops to Conquer,” and
later oh staged grand opera for the first
time in Melbourne.
* * * ♦
“B. A. Ker”; “Be sure of your facts”
is a canon of good writing, but apparently
it doesn’t apply to radio play-writing. A
serial my family follows worked up a
dramatic episode: a main character was
•dying; he needed a blood transfusion,
but he belonged to a “very rare blood
group—A-B.” Unless an A-B blood-
donor could be found he would surely
die. The suspense was kept up for two
nights before the right vintage was pro-
cured. Now, if the playwright had been
a blood-donor he might have asked the
doctor about blood groups—and been
told as I was; “A group can give and
take A blood. B can give and take B
blood. A-B can take any blood, but give
only to an A-B. Ois universal blood; it
can be given to any of the other three, but
an O patient can take only O blood or a
serum made of mixed bloods. The num-
ber after the letter, such as the Army
04, was used in case a wounded man
should be taken to a foreign hospital—
some nations use the numerals 1,2, 3, 4
instead of the letters.” But, of course, the
doctor could have been wrong.

“Waddlin’ Willie”: Add to the flowers
propagated by Alister Clark (B. 28/4/’4B)
the new rose “Remembrance” raised for
the war cemeteries where rest many Aus-
tralian heroes who failed to return.
Already a few of these roses are growing
in southern Australian war cemeteries,
and others are intended for burial-grounds
in France, Belgium and England. Four
were planted at Gallipoli on Anzac Day
by the Australian party which made a
pilgrimage there just before going to un-
veil the Tobruk memorial.
* * * *
“Aussie”: Admiral Bull Halsey,
U.S.N., can nevef have heard of “Our
Foreign Policy.” In the “Saturday Even-
ing Post” he tells of a controversy be-
tween MacArthur and himself over the
command of the naval base then being
constructed at Manus. Said Bull: “I told
him that the command of Manus didn’t
matter a whit to me. What did matter
was the quick construction of the base.
Kenney, or an Australian, or an enlisted
cavalryman could boss it for all I cared
as long as it was ready to handle the
Fleet,” It is apparent that only courtesy
to a war-time ally made Halsey put the
cavalryman last.
* * ♦ *
“Grapin”: The seamanship displayed
by Nepal’s skipper (B. 14/4/’4B) brings
to mind the time an Australian corvette
struck a spot of trouble in tying up to the
R.N. store ship. A terse signal was
flashed from the flagship—“ln the 2\
hours it took you to come alongside you
made every mistake imaginable.” No
doubt this pithy comment accounted for
the skipper’s haste as he raced full-steam
out of harbor next day. Flat-out at 15
knots he decided on a short-cut rather
than take the long way out via the busy-
dotted route. Next minute there was a
terrific thump. Crockery could be heard
crashing in all the messdecks, and there
was a mad stampede of half-asleep sailors
up the ladders to the upper deck. Only
our terrific 15 knots saved us from being
anchored for good on that sand-bar.
Throughout the ensuing eight-days trip
—at our now maximum speed of six
knots—the shearing and popping of the
hull rivets kept our nerves on edge. We
thought the skipper should have turned
back, but he preferred to face the sea
with all its moods rather than return
to another cutting signal.
“Momokan”: “Bo” (B. 14/4/’4B), in
writing of the “spectral figure, unseen and
unheard,” who delivered the early-morn-
ing milk in the “good old days” before
“planned economy,” forgets the difference
between the customers of today and those
of' former days. As a lad of 14 I
used to assist our milkman, and was
welcomed in the early hours with such
things as a flask of hot tea and a plate of
biscuits left on the kitchen table by the
lady of the house. Admittedly there
was more goodwill existing then.
We didn’t drop the lid of the can or pour
the milk all over the step just to let her
know we were on the job. We gave good
measure and left quietly after consuming
the oblation left to warm us on our
4.30 a.m. run. I worked with our milk-
man just for fun in those days and got
no payment except to be shouted to the
“flicks” on Saturday afternoon, but
though that was over 20 years ago, I can
still see that house in Shaftesbury-road
where we were treated so well.

“Scotia”; A Brisbane Judge tells it. As
he was leaving the courts one day an
old lag sidled up and said, “Your Honor
will remember me well. I wonder
whether you could let me have a dollar
to tide me over a rough patch?” His
Honor did not remember, and he asked
why he should be expected to deal out
largesse. “ ’Struth,” quoth the lag. “The
very last time we met you handed me
five years. Don’t y’ thmk it’s worth a
bob a year?” The Judge parted up, with
the conciliatory remark, “I do, old man;
I most certainly do! ”

“F.S.”: A remark made by Helen
Keller at the Blind Institute in Mel-
bourne —-“I do not regard blindness as
the greatest misfortune. The greatest mis-
fortune is with those who have eyes to
see with but cannot see” —shows that the
remarkable lady is a thinker, Despite
the lack of, two senses, she is so ab-
normally sensitive with regard to others
that she makes normal people appear
dull and stupid. During the visit, which
produced an extraordinary state of ex-
citement and ecstasy in the inmates, a
press photographer kept firing his flash-
light, and each time Miss Keller started,
although she was standing some distance
away and could neither hear nor see the
flashlight. The explanation is that her
tactile sense is so amazingly developed
that she felt the heat of the combustion.
A world in which people’s eyes were as
sensitive as this to art, architecture and
beauty would be a heaven.

“Bosun’s Mate”: In some years’ sea-
faring I have known cables to part, but
cannot remember an anchor ever failing.
Main reason is the stringent tests to which
the chunk of iron is subjected before
meeting a hawsepipe. Main test is drop-
ping. A five-ton anchor is hoisted 12ft.
on a tripping hook above a steel plate
embedded solidly in concrete, and sud-
denly dropped. Hoisted again, the anchor
is hammered and searched carefully for
flaws. If passed, it is taken to Garden
Island and, in a sunken trench, wrenched
with enormous tensile stresses by
hydraulic rams. Though roughly cast, the
operation of making anchors is precisely
controlled, and weight tolerances of its
parts allowed by Lloyd’s are small,

“Plop”: Sheer scientific brilliance is
afoot overseas. A Frenchman has proved
that a candle can be burned at both
ends and will flicker its last after two and
a half hours; an Englishman, that a
snail’s pace is exactly .00425 m.p.h.; and
a Yank, that it takes precisely 562 one-
dollar bills to choke a horse. Fired by
such genius, I, too, have been attempting
to improve my powers of observation, and
have found in the last week that it takes
the average radio listener exactly 2.794
seconds to realise that another episode in
the referendum serial is coming up and
to act appropriately, and that when a
Sydneysider has sat down to his dinner
and, mouth watering, is about to sink
the fangs in a porterhouse, it is to
one on that Bunnerong will say “No.”
UNBECOMING.
“Several South Australian clergymen have pro-
tested against the title ‘Daughter of Bacchus’ being
used for the vintage festival Popular Girl competi-
tion on the ground that it is unbecoming fcfr
Christian girls to be referred to as daughters of a
heathen idol.”
Still, few of all the girls we know between us
Would jib at being referred to, I believe,
As daughters of a legendary Venus
Rather than of a prehistoric Eve.
And Bacchus anyway was not Silenus.
Albeit the god of wine, you can’t conceive
Him in the role the other chap has got
As merely a disreputable sot.
Think of the light that various poets throw on
Ihe revels which they featured him among,
From Shakspeare’s “monarch of the vine” and
so on
To Dryden’s “ever fair and ever young,”
Recall the scenes that shed a cheerful glow on
His memory in the songs which Keats ha’s
sung!
These idols—call them pagan if you please—
Had mostly some engaging qualities.
Why, those who on Olympus lolled supremely
Or pulled their weight in Rome’s theogony
Had attributes you wouldn’t call unseemly
In modern blokes and coves like you and me.
Although their ethics may have fall’n extremely
Short of our notions of morality,
Their very names preserved you often find
In words that bring heroic deeds to mind.
In terms like “martial” it doesn’t follow
Disapprobation lurks to any extent.
Bards have been called “the sons of bright
Apollo,”
An appellation that we don’t resent
But rather take it as a far from hollow
And classically-chosen compliment,
Regardless of all else that it’s surmised
The lute-performer may have patronised.
N.S.W.
T. THE R.


“Zake”: Looking back to grandfather’s,
and even to father’s, day, one is saddened
by the thought of the humdrum life that
grandma and mother led as compared
with the housewife in these days of
“Labor’s” planned economy. Not for
them were those exciting chases around
the suburbs for a pound of potatoes; of
exercising their brains at the grocer’s
wondering what extra items to get so as
to qualify for three eggs from under the
counter. None of the enthusiasm en-
gendered by a search for a substitute for
salt, nor of that full satisfaction that
comes in washing-up greasy dishes with-
out soap. Under the silly old law of
supply and demand —since thoroughly
debunked by the “party’s” economists—
when things became, through seasonal
conditions, slightly less plentiful the price
went up a bit, and when ■ they became
abundant again they got a bit cheaper.
So they muddled along. When a couple
of inches of rain fell somewhere the cows
unaccountably failed to co-operate —they
just went on giving milk ; the feathered
matron, too, wouldn’t assist in the drive
for scarcity—she just went on laying,
even though autumn winds blew.
Throughout the years of my boyhood,
when I ran all the messages, never once
did I see mother’s face light up with the
jubilation that comes from being told
she’d have to put up without any sugar
for another fortnight, or that washing-
soda would be unprocurable for another
eight months —there was just tons of
everything. Good heavens! Grandma
and mother didn’t live —they merely
existed.
“Our bath-heater s been playing-up a bit on us lately, too."
“Jim O’Keeffe”: During one of the
early New Guinea campaigns our briga-
dier wanted one of the new-type Yank
.45 automatic pistols. The fateful finger
pointed at„ the amenities officer. Pro-
cedure, which had to be illegal anyway,
was not specified, but it was indicated
that the old man had certain unpleasant
ideas at the ready in case the specified
type of hand-cannon was not promptly
forthcoming. One was procured,
promptly. The brig, exuded gratitude
and admiration for both the weapon and
the genius who procured it. Then he
spoilt everything by demanding a detailed
report. The A.O. protested jocularly, then
persuasively, then bitterly, that the query
was unethical, unnecessary and in poor
taste, but a succession of withering blasts
at last brought out the story. He had
worded the Q.M., drawn a British-service
type .38 pistol in the brig.’s name, and
then had it written off as lost in action.
He’d swapped the ,38 with an obliging
Yank for the .45. The A.O. still reckons
he was lucky the .45 wasn’t loaded.
“Becks”: After years of patient study
I am still baffled by the average news-
hound’s conception of what constitutes
news. A scribe covering the Garden case
deemed it worthy of notice that “Garden
was smartly dressed in a double-breasted
blue suit”; another reported that Ex-
ternal Territories Minister Ward gave his
evidence “in a pin-striped suit.” I have
given careful thought to the matter and
I cannot see that the tenor of the trial
would have been altered one iota had
Jock turned up in a single-breasted suit
or if Eddie had “chosen” a neat check
suiting. Neither gentleman has ever
claimed to be a leader of men’s fashions,
so it cannot be that the reporter was
giving the public a lead on what the well-
dressed man should wear in the dock or
witness-box. I can imagine circumstances
in which the attire of the two men would
have been news; had they worn French
bathing-suits, chain-mail armor, Newtown
football guernseys, zoot-suits, tropical
pyjamas, top-hat and tails, natty loin-
cloths or dude-ranch rigouts I would
not cavil for a moment at a mention of
their sartorial choice. Even if they were
dressed in nothing at all I would con-
sider the fact worthy of mention. But
double-breasted and pin-striped suits?
No, they just ain’t news.

“Mac”: King’s ships' have done some
strange jobs, but one involving the re-
building of a hospital is surely unique.
Queen Mary Hospital, on the slopes of
the peak at Hong Kong, was badly
damaged during the war. Its repair was
urgent, but facilities were strictly limited.
So the Navy moved in H.M.S. Artifex,
one of the floating Workshops which took
the place of island bases during the
Pacific advances. Ship’s artificers made
such a good job of the hospital that their
first-aid was solicited, and given, in re-
habilitating the whole port.

“Clooter”: Mareo, the London-born
Austrian musician who was twice sen-
tenced to death in N.Z. for the murder
of his second wife and was reprieved, has
been freed after serving 12 years of a life
sentence in jail. Back in 1936 his
case pushed the Spanish Civil War,
Potato Jones, Hitler and similar items out
of the headlines. Handsome and of un-
doubted musical talent, he was conduct-
ing a West End orchestra and, about
1925, cast up in Australia with a London
medico’s missus.- They married after the
doctor divorced her, and Mareo was a
leading light in Sydney. At 41 his wife
died, and shortly afterwards he married
a Brisbane Uni. graduate of 27, Miss
Trott, actress, musician and linguist.
After touring Australia and N.Z. with a
revue, the Mareos settled in N.Z. The
second Mrs; Mareo died in 1935, drugs
were found in Mareo’s home and in the
defunct Mrs. Mareo. The Crown case
rested chiefly on the evidence of Freda
Stark, friend of the dead woman, who
alleged that Mareo had refused to seek
medical aid for his sick wife until it was
too late. Mareo was sentenced to death.
Five months later there was a second
trial, with the same result. For months
a controversy raged as to his guilt orf
otherwise, his sentence having meantime
been commuted to life imprisonment, and f
various individuals and groups worked to (J
get him cleared. In 1941 a British poisons
expert was found to say that the Crown’s
theory was wrong, but by that time the
world was absorbed in more urgent mat-
ters. An attempt to have the case re-
opened in 1945 failed.

“Scotia”: Touching the remarks on

shall We bring our own grog ?”
persuasive, but he also has a breezily
humorous humanity when addressing a
crowd. He stole the Labor Day thunder
when he spoke at Brisbane City Hall
against the referendum proposals, and
captivated the less disciplined by remark-
ing casually: “There has been one im-
provement at least since I last spoke
from this stage.... There is a placard
near the stairs saying, ‘Do not take lemon-
ade-bottles upstairs and| throw them at
the speaker.’ That,” remarked Bob, “I
regard as the last exquisite touch of
courtesy.” It did the trick; he had a
wonderful hearing.

“Flip”: The salesgirl at the perfume
counter was a tali blonde with
purple nails and switchback eyebrows.
I told her I wanted a, special perfume
for a lady and that the only clues I had
were that it was a straw-colored liquid
that smelt like flowers and came in a
bottle with a plastic lid and a sort of glass
stick hanging down inside. Dismissing
my description with a sigh, she leant
over the counter and purred: “This lady,
is she a girl you’ve met recently? We
have something very nice at thirty shil-
lings.” I was immensely flattered, but
had to tell her that Fd met and married
the girl 20 years ago. The blonde turned
off her superchargers and the remainder
of our business was carried out with high
formality at the five-bob level.

“Craiser”: Yehudi Menuhin, whose
pianist sister Hephzibah has again come
out of retirement to play at Melbourne
Town Hall, wasn’t always as fashionable
as he is at present. On one occasion
he was engaged to play at a posh Man-
hattan party and the hostess came up to
him and said: “Of course, Mr. Menuhin,
you won’t be expected to mix with the
guests.” “Thanks, Madam,” retorted the
violinist politely, looking round him.
“Then I’ll cut the fee by half.”

“Macnell”; Destroyer seamanship?
The come-alongside was perfect—bow in,
head-rope ashore, nothing left but to
go astern on the spring and kick the
blunt-end in. But the sub-lieutenant aft
was a zealous young man and meant to
get his end secured first—the fo’c’sle
might have been a mile away. The capstan
for ; ard heaved, the winch aft groaned
and the ship lurched hard up against the
big fender amidships. The Old Man,
headed for his cabin ladder, altered course
and hung violently over the bridge wind-

“Pitt St.”: There was space for just one
more in the rear compartment of the
Sydney tram, and I squeezed into it. The
conductor was up front somewhere and
I was still hanging on to my trey when
a ticket-inspector bobbed up. I showed
him the trey. “Where did you get on?”
he asked. I told him, he nodded and
dropped off. In his place appeared the
conductor, who. glowered at me and said,
| ‘There. You’ve gone an’ got me into
trouble.” I was so overcome with guilt
i—or something—that I was unable to
, eply. I suppose he’ll hate me all his life.
Bo”: The season of inter-State foot-
ball is at hand, and the time is ripe for
some stout work by the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Crowds. I re-
fer in particular to that most boring of
all stunts, the synthetic kick-off.
Borrowed, as are most public exhibitions
of fatuity, from the U.S., where they’d
no more think of starting a big-time ball
game without a politician or mayor
heaving the first pill
than they would of
sticking to a foreign
policy, there is
usually a prolonged
preamble as some-
one places the ball
after much heel-
digging and -screw-
ing. Occasionally the
“celebrity” selected
to*' kick off tries to
impress on the rabble
his profound know-
ledge of the game by
replacing the ball to
his own fancy. Then,
with a good look all
round to make sure
that everyone’s gaz-
ing, he waddles up to
the ball—mostly he’s
got to that stage of
embonpoint which
precludes any swifter
method of perambu-
lation —puts all he’s
got into the kick and
watches the bail
dribble about four
yards. The players
politely try to sup-
press grins, the
scrum is ordered
back on the centre
line, thus depriving
either one side or
the other of the ad-
vantage that might
have accrued from the properly-kicked
ball. They do these things better in
Nicaragua, where they shoot anyone who
holds up the game.

“Muskeen”: “Laetitia” (B. 5/5/’4B)
will probably be flattered to learn that his
great-granddaddy’s likeness was once de-
picted in London “Punch.” In case the
family portrait hasn’t been handed down
he may be interested to hear that the old
bhoy’s consideration for others was not
equalled by his looks, Charles Keene
illustrated the incident recorded by
“Laetitia” in the issue of July 27, 1878.
It’s no use “L.” protesting that his an-
cestor was the more haudsome of the two
Irishmen depicted; both are equally un-

“Uramao”; My friend George had one
or two aboard when he entered the home-
bound train. Passing through a tunnel
a man was reported to have fallen off;
the train was stopped and officials and
several of the passenger?, including
George, went back to render assistance.
Later I asked George “Was the man
seriously injured?” “No, no ; only a few
boozes,” was Lis reply.

“Ike Hollar”; Mobbed by autograph-
hunters, Eileen Joyce only experienced
what happens to practically everybody in
Australia with any claim to notability—
in Sydney at all events. A multitude of
small boys descend like a swarm of flies
upon tired footballers or cricketers as
they are leaving the field, stand outside
the special entrance to places like the
Stadium or at stage-doors of theatres
ready to pounce on the first notable they
see. I have seen a surf-event winner, hero
for a moment, harried from the moment
he began to emerge from the water by
a tribe of urchins with books and pencils
howling for his signature. But the
queerest manifestation was when a small
boy stood solemnly by while ambulance-
men tried to bring back to consciousness
a man who had been knocked in a street
accident. As the victim stirred the boy
moved eagerly forward. “Is he your
father, son?” asked one of the St. John’s
men. “No, sir; I’m waiting t’ get his
autograph,” said the youngster.

“Sixenate”: Quite educated people, of
course, may stumble into the misuse of
words, A divorce Judge was pqzzled
when a woman who had been a teacher
before marriage said several times that her
husband had always been “parsonical”
in his treatment of herself. That descrip-
tion hardly tallied with allegations that
he had been continually drunk, had fre-
quently bashed her and was in the habit
of cursing in front of the children and
visitors. Puzzling over it. His Honor,
when petitioner used the word again, was
able to suggest the word she might mean.
“Of course I meant parsimonious,” she
said. “1 said ‘parsimonious,’ didn’t I?”
TWO HUNDRED MILLION
YEARS AGO.
“A fossilised fish has been discovered at Whale
Beach, Sydney, of a species hitherto unknown but
pronounced by paleontologists to have lived in the
Triassic age, about two hundred million years ago.”
It makes one wonder more and more
How many forms of life there’ve been
On this terrestrial orb before
Our sort arrived upon the scene.
Here’s one that’s vanished from the stage
Leaving no trace except to show
It lived m the Triassic age
Two hundred million years ago.
Here’s one, or all that’s left of him.
Who frolicked round at eve or morn
In sons distant, dark and dim
When panting Time was hardly born.
Could fossils speak, think what a lot
Of fascinating stuff we’d know
Concerning, this salubrious spot
Two hundred million years ago!
With things that were, by sea or land,
It’s numbered now, long hid from view,
The saurian plesiosaurus and
The winged pterodactyl too;
Though scientists have got a hunch,
Backed by geology, to show
It antedated all the bunch
Two hundred million years ago.
Look on this fragmentary bit
Of petrified antiquity,
And muse how brief, compared with it,
The span on earth of man must be.
Grant him his period, if you wish,
A mere few thousand years or so,
And then reflect that there were fish
Two hundred million years ago.
Compared with this, ’twas yesterday
Our kin ran wild in woods and fens.
I wonder has he come to stay,
Our good old Homo sapiens ?
Or will some form of life, as yet
Unglimpsed, his mastery overthrow
And teach him that his star has set,
Like this poor fish who “done a get”
Two hundred million years ago?

The, M.L.C.’s sixty-first annual report
not only reveals a further 13.8 p.c.
advance on the record figures for new
business set in 1946 and a general sound-
ness throughout the co.’s financial struc-
ture ; it also offers some pointers on
current tendencies in Australian assur-
ance. The most notable trend, of course,
has been the post-war growth in business.
A comparative abundance of money
has enabled the public to become articu-
late in its appreciation of the security
offered by assurance. Some policy-
holders have doubtless been influenced by
the rising price-level, which now calls
for larger monetary benefits in old-age or
for their dependants ; others by the fact
that their existing policies aren’t at present
likely to receive • bonus additions on the
pre-war scale. Altogether it has been a
fertile field, in which the M.L.C. has
reaped very successfully, its scale of bush
ness having more than doubled since
1937.
Regarding the nature of this new busi-
ness, M.L.C.’s figures suggest, firstly, that
the Industrial branch has held its position
in the general advance despite the rising
popularity of group assurance and despite
the present state of money prosperity.
Industrial accounted for 28 p.c. of the
co.’s net sums assured at Dec. 31, 1947
(excluding bonuses), compared with 26
p.c. in 1937.
More emphatic is the swing shown in
both branches towards endowment
assurance policies and away from whole-
life. Whereas the scale of whole-life
business in force was about seven-eighths
that of endowment assurance in 1937,
the proportion is now only three-eighths
(double endowments excluded);
Dec.,1937. Dec.,1947.
Ord. sums assured*—
Whole life .. ..£25,581,870 £40,366,994

Endowment .. .. 32,707,572 112,987,572
• Excluding bonuses.
This trend towards endowment assurance
was evident before the war, but it has
become accelerated. Conferring wider
benefits on their holders, these policies
require larger premiums, and the trend
has contributed towards the higher pre-
mium incomes of the life offices.
For 1947, the M.L.C.’s total revenue
from Ordinary, Industrial and General
branches—the first two are shown sepa-
rately in the introductory table—was
£8,517,381, an increase of £900,390. Pre-
mium payments accounted for £6,709,080
of the revenue, whilst interest and rents
brought in £1,808,301, after £185,772 tax
deduction.
The various claims under policies
absorbed £2,722,065 and expenses
took £1,349,557. After writing down
securities by £28,835, contributing
£177,798 (nearly three times the 1946
figure) to staff funds and paying share-
holders £166,667 in dividends and
bonuses, a sum of £4,168,804 was added
to the Ordinary and Industrial assurance
funds, making them £49,853,885.
Very creditable expense rates were
shown, having regard to the large amount
of new business and general rises in
costs. In the Ordinary branch expenses
(excluding tax) were 14.9 p.c. of net
premium income, compared with 13.9
p.c. in 1946. The Industrial expense rate
was 27.8 p.c. compared with 26.7 p.c. in
1946. Though costly at the outset, ex-
panding business will help to reduce over-
head charges per unit in later years.
Of the surplus in the assurance funds
declared by the actuary for 1946, 92 p.c.
in the Ordinary and 87 p.c. in the Indus-
trial branches have been distributed in
bonuses to policyholders and a p.c.
dividend has been declared on share-
holders’ £1,000,000 capital. The latest
valuation shows a surplus in both depart-
ments which is £119,595 greater:
1937. 1938. 1946. 1947.
Ordinary.. £789,433 £849,680 £928,621 £1,038,161
Industrial. 102,594 115,459 158,924 168,979
Total .. £892,027 £965,139 £1,087,545 £1,207,140
Remembering that mean assurance funds
stood at £24,107,142 over the 1937-38
period, compared with £45,685,081 in
1946-47, the relative decline in surplus
declarations is apparent. But the figures
are not entirely comparable because of
•the high proportion of new policies in
present business ; Australian bonus scales
generally require valuation rates in early
years that hold back sums for quicker
release as the age of the policy increases.
The Government’s cheap-money drive
is mainly responsible for the more
subdued bonus policy. The M.L.C.’s
rate of discount for valuation purposes
is now 2\ p.c. Ordinary, compared with
3 p.c. in 1935, whilst for most of its In-
dustrial contracts a stringent 2 p.c.
rate is applied. Each basis provides a
sound margin over current earnings ; after
deducting taxes, the net effective rate
earned on assurance funds alone was £3
15s. 4d. (down Is. Id.) in the Ordinary
branch and £3 11s. 6d. (down 4s. 3d.)
in the Industrial —figures which stand up
well to present comparisons.
In its investment policy the co, is
continuing its traditional support for
Government securities and home-finance,
but there are difficulties —low yields on
new bond-issues and conversions, pro-
hibitive costs in the building trade.
Mortgages and homebuilding loans
(many of them carrying life policies as
collateral) represent 11.5 p.c. of total
assets as against 25.1 p.c. in 1939:

To leaven the interest return, the
M.L.C., in company with other life offices,
is carefully extending its holding of com-
pany shares. From the Stock Exchange
viewpoint, the effects should be of a
stabilising nature —short-term fluctuations
won’t greatly concern these institutional
investors.

During the last 12 months a purposeful
temper has developed in the States of
Queensland and Victoria, which are aim-
ing to abolish or reduce their dependence
on N. S. Wales coal. The Queensland
Government has indicated it will not
tolerate white-anting of the arrange-
ments with the Electric Supply Corpora-
tion of Britain to draw cheap opencut
coal from Blair Athol in quantities far
exceeding the State’s needs; the cor-
poration’s plans are said to include a
shipping fleet for carrying supplies inter-
state. Victoria’s natural resources are
less favorable, but the new Administration
is pushing ahead proposals to open up
the Morwell brown-coal field, to complete
the Bogong-Kiewa hydro-electric scheme,
to increase briquetting plants and to dis-
pense with black coal by methods like
the extension of diesel and electric rail-
way services.
In both States the movement will take
time to get into full swing, but there is
no doubt of its significance. It does not
result from a genuine deficiency in
N. S. Wales but from deliberate Com-
munist tactics in the mines and on the
wharves. One of the familiar arguments
of the Miners’ Federation has been that
“overproduction” of coal would lead to
unemployment; the real danger now is
that the repercussions of their under-
production will bring depression to the
N. S. Wales fields.
This new development intimately affects
Howard Smith, a holding co. whose
major interests are shipping and coal.
Both sections are already operating
under difficulties, and the co.’s ordi-
nary divs. over the past 20 years
barely average p.c. Some progress
had been made after the 1930 slump until
war brought official controls over most
of its interests, and the controls are prov-
ing long-lived. After six years of un-
profitable chartering receipts from the
Government, the shipping subsidiary
(Australian Steamships Pty.) took over its
fleet again last August. It is still too early
to determine whether the new freight
charges allowed by Canberra will prove
profitable; with shipbuilding costs more
than doubled, the Government reserving
the coastal trade for locally-built vessels
which must be replaced every 25 years
and threatening to enter the trade on
its own account, the co. has naturally
refrained from making any extensions to
its shipping subsidiary. No action has
been taken to replace the 34-year-old
cargo and passenger steamer Canberra,
which was sold last term ; a tug which also
had to be retired was replaced by a re-
fitted vessel that had been “purchased
secondhand in New Zealand.”
Similar restraints on initiative are being
suffered by Howard Smith’s main coal in-
terests, Caledonian Collieries, Ltd., and
Invincible Collieries, Ltd. Output is
kept at about 75 p.c. of capacity by
strikes, absenteeism and rigid limitation
of output by miners, whilst prices, dis-
tribution and genera] production are
controlled by the Joint Coal Board.
Under the circumstances, it is not surpris-
ing that the 1947 balance-sheet shows few
important developments. Fixed assets
are down £93,505, whilst £371,949 has
been added to cash and bonds, outside
indebtedness rising by £89,175:

The small addition of £739 to investments
covers an interesting reshuffle. Shares in
non-listed cos. rose by £25,987 (new in-
terests in stevedoring cos.), whilst the re-
duction of £25,248 in the book value of
listed shares seems to have yielded a
realisation profit of £lOO,OOO. Of Howard
Smith’s known shareholdings, only the
two colliery concerns and A, Goninan
and B.H.P. are listed cos.
The new bids for State autonomy in
coal could affect not only the colliery
interests of Howard Smith, but also its
cargo shipping. The co.’s trading future
obviously depends on political develop-
ments ; meantime it is content, as the
chairman says, “to conserve its financial
resources.” According to the books, net
tangible backing of the £1 ords. is 30s.
sd. each, about half in liquid assets. At
the current price of 265. 6d. the yield is
3.4 p.c. on last year’s div. basis.

For the first time in 25 years it can be said
that monetary prosperity has come to the
confectionery trade. Some time before
the economic depression of 1930 manu-
facturers had found that their com-
bined productive capacity was greater
than the public’s appetite; trading be-
came abnormally competitive and re-
mained so until the war. Today, how-
ever, the industry is working at full pres-
sure. Hoadley’s had put up maximum
capacity figures in output for three suc-
cessive years until extra plant was in-
stalled last term ; its Sydney subsidiary,
which began manufacturing only in 1944,
is turning out more than the parent did
10 years ago, but the demand is still nol
fully satisfied.
In an era of paper-money prosperity
like the present, there are obvious reasons
for doubting the permanence of this de-
mand—and there are signs that the public
will soon be asked to pay higher prices for
its chocolates. The cost of cocoa-beans is
now £3OO a ton, compared with an aver-
age of £154 last year and £74 in 1946 ;
and Hoadley’s have found that the 40-
hour week, which operated in the Sydney
branch for a part of last term, has in-
creased the wages cost per unit by 234
p.c. Applications for price increases will
be made to Canberra next month. If
granted they will take some edge off
the demand, although it seems that the
consumption of confectionery may settle
finally on a per capita level considerably
higher than in 1939.
Hoadley’s history is a fairly typical one.
Established in 1913, the co. prospered
until the mid-’twenties, then losses from
1928 to 1931 averaged £14,600 a year,
whilst for the next six years (to 1937) an
average profit of £362 was shown. To
wipe off the deficit, in 1935 ordinary capital
was reduced from £175,000 to £58,333,
each £1 share being cut to 6s. Bd. Pref.

Overdraft is high in relation to

further, and the board intends to

has emphasised in the past its
preference for bank finance
rather than new capital issues.
Last year’s profit represented
30.3 p.c. on total capital, com-
pared with 22.2 p.c. in 1946.
Annual tax provisions aren’t

War-time (Co.) Tax last term
was said to account for £6OOO
of the £10,797 improvement in
profits. Costs will possibly rise
in advance of selling prices this

SUGAR
SHORTAGE
Sydney,
sth May, 1948.
TO THE PUBLIC:
Raw sugar has started to arrive here after
a two months’ stoppage of supplies caused by
the Queensland watersiders’ strike.
We are pleased to say our Sydney refinery
has immediately resumed refining to fill the
accumulated demand. Ordering will be very
high because stocks of sugar normally held by
housewives and by grocers and factories have
been exhausted.
Already 15,000 tons of refined sugar pro-
duction has been lost this year by waterfront
and coalfields strikes. This loss is 20 per cent,
of what we would have produced normally in
the first four months of the year.
We have a serious manpower shortage at
the factory which limits the speed at which
recovery can take place. However, we are
refining at about 4,000 tons a week and deliver-
ing as quickly as the sugar can be packed.
Naturally, as a business enterprise, we
are anxious to refine and sell as much
sugar as possible. We very much regret the
inconvenience caused to our customers by the
shortage.

Deadly Taxation
In the last year of the war the
Commonwealth levied £346 mil-
lion in taxation of all kinds and
reimbursed the States with £33
million. The net figure, £313
million, was augmented by £3l
million of “business income,”
making total Commonwealth
revenue for 1944-45 £344 million.
For the current financial year
it was estimated that the Com-
monwealth revenue from taxes
would be £364 million, to which
post-office and railway revenue
would add £33 million. The
States were to be reimbursed to
the tune of £45 million, leaving
net tax revenue at £319 million
and net total revenue at £352
million.
Although Commonwealth esti-
mates for the present year sug-
gested a drop, compared with
the previous year, of some £l5
million or £l6 million in total
collections, it is evident from
progress figures that 1947-48 will
again represent a year of record
heavy taxation of the people by
the Commonwealth and State
authorities higher than the
1946-47 peak, and much greater
than the levies made during the
war year of heaviest taxation. A
deficit of £3O million was bud-
geted for in 1947-48, but Mr.
Chifley now expects a surplus.
The expansion in tax collec-
tions by the Commonwealth
authority has been enormous
during and since the war. In
1938-39 income-tax collections.
Commonwealth and State, aggre-
gated £42 million. For 1946-47
they were £2OB million, apart
from payroll tax. Federal in-
come taxes alone in the last pre-
war year were no more than
£l2 million. For 1946-47 they
aggregated £l6B million, allow-
ing for reimbursement of the
States; and during the current
year they are going to be higher
still.
Income taxes raised and spent
by the Chifley Government are
therefore in the vicinity of 15
times greater than before the
war, and combined Federal and
State income taxes are about five
times greater than in 1939. And,
during the nine years of this vast
increase in the exactions of Gov-
ernment upon the earnings of the
people, the estimated national in-
come has not even doubled. It
is reckoned to be about half as
much again as in 1938-39,
whereas, let it be repeated, total
income taxes levied increased by
five times, and the Common-
wealth levies alone by nearly 15
times. The Federal civil service
has more than trebled in the
same period.
The huge increase in taxation
levies under “Labor” and its
stubborn refusal to do much
about reducing them has been
part and parcel of the Canberra
socialisation planning. The
vastly-swollen tax collections,
which weigh so heavily on the
taxpayer, especially when he is
engaged in private enterprise,
are employed by the Chifley
Government to compete with
private enterprise for labor, to
engage in competition in trans-
port and other services, and to
enter into the vote-buying game
on an unparalleled sqale. The
cost of “social security” has
risen enormously under the
Chifleys, and departmental ac-
tivities and payrolls have been
extended on the grand scale.
Members’ and Ministers’ salaries
have been raised, and all kinds
of Governmental costs have in-
flated at the expense of private
enterprise, thrift and initiative.
The growth in the cost of in-
terest on the national debt has
been less than £4O million sin9e
war began, but increase in the
national taxation bill has been
more like £250 million. It was
the cost of servicing additions to
the national debt that was Jaeld
before the people as the reason
for keeping taxation high after
war expenditure ceased. In
1943-44, for instance, total war
outlay was £544 million. Ad-
mittedly, £377 million of this
was paid for out of loan money.
But instead of tax levies decreas-
ing since the drain of war has
ceased they have increased pro-
digiously.
Chifley “Labor” has made use
of a situation arising out of a
tragic war to endeavor to force
socialisation through taxation,
and, making unashamed use
“By growing it and rolling my own , look at all the excise-
duty I save!”
of the failure of the Admmi-
stration to restore national
production to its former levels,
to* achieve another socialistic
advance through the con-
tinued enforcement of price-
control, the low level of pro-
duction being one of the specious
and contradictory arguments
used to support the continuance
of price-control.
Taxation and price-controls
are becoming socialistic rackets,
just as the proposed “nationafisa-
tion” of banking is a racket with
the same murky political objec-
tive. .
The Sharemarket
Holders of B.H.P. and Barrier
shares last week had the satis-
faction of seeing record prices
again being paid for the scrip,
the vicissitudes of the past
couple of months notwithstand-
ing. A slackening towards the
week-end still left the shares at
a high point, and on Monday
New York sharemarket strength
was reflected in Australia. Banks,
too, have gone to better levels.
Slower to recover have been
brewery shares. Felt and Tex-
tiles, Henry Jones and A.C.1.,
though most stocks are up
from the low points of six
weeks ago, and many are re-
approaching their post - war
peaks. Textile issues remain in
demand, Yarra Falls and Brad-
ford Cotton being especially
sought after. Burlington Mills
has not recovered all the ground
previously lost; highest price
this year was 575., which com-
pares with 525. 3d. acpepted last
week. A new issue of half a
million £1 prefs. carrying 4f p.c.
is being offered through the
underwriters, J. B. Were and
Son, who handled the Felt and
Textiles issue of 1,260,000 4 p.c.
prefs. recently.
There has been a keen Lon-
don demand for B.H.P. and
Barrier mines. The position of
sterling has been one reason for
this ; another has been London’s
interest in the proposed B.H.P.
development of the tinplate in-
dustry here, and the fact that
Barriers have always interested
London followers of the lead
market.
The recovery of the share-
market as a whole was in keep-
ing with forecasts here at the
time of the February-March
slump. Money has lost so much
of its buying-power that the
eventual settling-down of paper-
money values of goods and ser-
vices seems bound to be at
figures considerably higher than
those we were accustomed to in
1939 and the years before ; and
share prices are likely to be in
accord with other prices, especi-
ally if the national price-level
once more relies on efficient pro-
duction and competition for its
“controls.” Under more com-
petitive conditions the less
efficient enterprises may suffer,
but first-class industrial concerns
would be in a stronger position
and able to reward shareholders
from their extra initiative and
business capacity.
Transport Efficiency
A very real danger to the pro-
gress of Australia is the tax
upon road and other forms of
transport not conducted by Gov-
eminent undertakings. Perhaps
the most economically important
feature of a country is its pro-
ductivity ; the next must be its
transport capacity. In a nation
the geographical size of Aus-
tralia transport is a specially im-
portant function ; there are long
hauls from the rural back-
country to seaports, and from
the manufacturing centres of
Victoria and New South Wales
to other parts of the Common-
wealth. Yet Governments are
discouraging in every possible
way the development of more
efficient transport services. Road
transport is taxed heavily by
State authorities, and private
buses are not encouraged to
compete with Government ser-
vices regardless of the inade-
quacy of the public transport
system. In most States private
bus-lines are not allowed except
where they feed a Government-
owned transport system, or
where it does not suit the Gov-
ernment to run trams, trains or
buses.
The inadequacy of the rail-
ways and inter-State shipping ser-
vices is revealed by the number
of heavy-duty lorries engaged in
carrying goods to and from
Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney
and Brisbane. Yet every possible
tax and obstacle is placed by
officialdom in the way of such
transport, which must essentially
have heavy costs to meet with-
out Government penalisation.
Originally transport-strangu-
lation was brought in by State
Governments to save their
rapidly-declining railways, i n
which a great deal of capital has
been invested. But from that
point it has developed into a
general policy of opposition to
private transport; and the more
efficient the private transport
system is, the greater the Gov-
ernment hostility. This was re-
vealed in the Commonwealth
move to wipe out all privately-
owned airlines in Australia, the
setting-up of competing airlines
the losses of which are being
met by taxes levied upon the
public, and by the interference
in the coastal shipping industry.
During the Government’s war-
time control of the shipping
trade it succeeded in inflating all
operating costs to a most burden-
some degree. It has barred ships
over a certain age, regardless of
their remaining usefulness and
the urgent demand for shipping
space. Now it is going into the
shipping business itself on an ex-
tensive and expensive scale, re-
gardless of the damage that may
be done to the sea-transport
system as a whole.

LONDON AIRMAIL
From Herbert Holman
Silver Wedding
The crowds that lined the
streets for their Majesties’ drive
simply oozed good - feeling.
Strangers became friends at
sight; children were helped to
the front with anxious courtesy
and the bluejackets we saw on
guard in Ludgate Hill were
noticeably paternal towards
them. The lighthearted cama-
raderie of old came again to the
pageant-proud streets. It was
everybody’s celebration, and
everybody’s heart was glad.
If the decorations were less
lavish than in other days it was
not because of lack of effort.
All the flags were out. Some
of the newspaper offices in Fleet-
street found bunting with which
to deck themselves, and one
“daily” sported a large window-
box of blue and pink hydran-
geas. Pictorial records of their
Majesties’ reign graced many
large windows.
Demolished buildings became
temporary grandstands, and one
sight not soon to be forgotten
was an old lady sitting astride
a 10ft. hoarding.
Of all contributors, Nature
herself was the best. The sun
defiantly beat the clouds that
had been forecast only a few
hours before. April flowers drew
crowds to the parks. Lilac and
early irises are in bloom. Tulips
blaze with richly colored fresh-
ness. In the Queen’s Gardens
opposite Buckingham Palace
they are mauve ; near the Houses
of Parliament they are scarlet
and white.
Petrol Rationing
The findings of the Vick Com-
mittee on the evasion of petrol
rationing came as no surprise to
Britain’s motorists, who have
long known that there was no
nation-wide organised “racket,”
directed in sinister secrecy by
some master-mind.
A too-generous issue of
coupons to some commercial
users has accounted for the sur-
plus being diverted into the
blackmarket. On the other side,
officials of concerns owning
lorries have “acquired” a few
gallons from time to time for
use in their private cars, to
barter for some service, or to
give away to less-fortunate
friends.
The report, which states that
there was “a multiplicity of in-
dividual transactions within the
coupon system,” adds a word in
conclusion that “honesty cannot
be universally enforced by regu-
lation.” Which is much the
same as saying that while dollars
—and petrol —are short, those
motorists who “make it a virtue
to evade the regulations” will
continue to do so, if they can
find any loopholes.
Commercial petrol is to be cut
by a further 10 p.c,; it will be
colored red with an irremovable
dye and will contain a chemical
that can be identified even in a
weak solution. Instead of the
normal penalties of fine and/or
imprisonment, offenders will be
deprived of petrol and the use
of the road for 12 months.
The private motorist is to be
allowed petrol for 90 miles a
month or, if he chooses, 540
miles in six months. That is to
say, he may eke it out frugally
or have one spendthrift trip—
perhaps a bit of both. But the
person who has been granted a
supplementary allowance on
business or compassionate
grounds is to have the same
amount as before. In theory,
therefore, the businessman can’t
have a pleasure trip unless he
does so at the expense of his
work.
Murder
Jurisprudence stands or
should stand —above the heat of
passionate feeling; its weightier
issues demand a studied and un-
emotional approach.
These conditions were hardly
satisfied in the House of Com-
mons on the passing of the
clause which suspends the death-
penalty for a trial period of five
years. It was a free vote (ex-
cept to Ministers) and the
“Ayes”—preponderantly Labor
backbenchers cheered jubi-
lantly and excitedly waved order-
papers.
The police and, indeed, the
general public were less jubilant.
Informed opinion has long advo-
cated the ultimate removal of
the death-penalty. But not yet.
In fact, no time less happy than
the present for such an experi-
ment could have been chosen.
Modern conditions favor the
criminal, who too often gets
away with his crime. The police
are overtaxed and understaffed
(they are 15,000 below strength
—5OOO in London alone). Some
20,000 deserters still at large are
compelled to live on their wits
and easily drift into gangster-
dom. And gangsters, as the
police know too well, tend to
be gun-conscious and “trigger-
happy,”
The first conviction for mur-
der after the passing of the
clause bears its own grim irony.
Thomas, a 22-year-old deserter,
was stopped by an unarmed
policeman who interviewed him
by lamplight. Carrying a num-
ber of false identity-cards, he
thoughtlessly produced the true
one by mistake. While the
policeman was taking particulars
Thomas took fright, drew a re-
volver and plugged three bullets
into him. The interview, he
said, “was extremely incon-
venient, as he was a deserter.”
The bill was debated in the
House of Lords much more
grimly than in the Commons,
and was ultimately rejected.
the 8.8. C.
- At the end of February there
were 11,233,500 broadcast-
receiving licences in force in
Britain, including 43,500 tele-
vision The annual fee
is a pound, and a similar addi-
tional fee is paid for television
sets. Until the outbreak of war
a percentage of all licence
revenue was paid to the 8.8. C.
to maintain its services. During
war-time the 8.8. C. was financed
by a grant-in-aid from Parlia-
ment, the income from licence-
fees being regarded officially as
“quite inadequate to support the
vast overseas services operating
since 1939.”
Since January 1, 1947, the
pre-war system of financing
operations out of licence income
has been reverted to for broad-
casting to all listeners within the
U.K., including television ; over-
seas services still depend on
grant-in-aid.
The television service, sus-
pended during the war, was re-
sumed on June 7, 1946. Tele-
vision covers every sort of
activity from plays and public
celebrations to sporting events
and cookery demonstrations.
The present service is restricted
to a radius of roughly 40 miles
from Alexandra Palace, North
London, though there have been
many reports of good reception
at greater distances.

But don’t expect the Red “Yes”-man to look like the Bolshie in

SUNDRY SHOWS
Melbourne Music.
The second “celebrity” con-
cert of the current season at Mel-
bourne Town Hall was a
strangely-mixed programme, and
it got a strangely-mixed recep-
tion from the vast crowd which
packed the hall from organ-loft
to back ceiling. Mozart’s Sym-
phony No. 39 in E Flat Major is
a lovely piece of music with a
glorious opening adagio and an-
dante and an exquisite theme
for violins, with a witty and
melodious finale thrown in for
good measure. Under Heinze’s
baton the orchestra did it full
justice, but it got only a per-
functory round of handclaps.
The Russian composer Rein-
hold Gliere followed with a
Concerto for Coloratura and
orchestra. It was an attempt,
apparently, to present the human
voice as another instrument
divorced from its customary as-
sociations, and the vocal part
was wordless. All the singer had
to do was to say “ha-ha,” rather
like a kookaburra. Inasmuch
as the singer was the diminutive
Erna Berger, however, the mono-
syllable acquired an extraordi-
nary significance during its half-
hour of repetition. Miss Berger’s
vocal instrument rose and sank,
shrilled, broke halfway through
a note, was muted, whizzed in
and out and round about an in-
tricate cadenza and sometimes
seemed completely one with the
violins or violas or flutes behind
her. It was a phenomenal
achievement from the technical
standpoint, and the audience
went mad about it. Still, it is
doubtful whether it would have
wanted it repeated.
The house was much more
ecstatic when the Berlin State
Opera soprano brought her bril-
liant artistry and effortless phras-
ing to “Ah! Lo Sa,” from “The
Magic Flute.” Gliere’s music
sounded ordinary alongside it.
It was a first performance in
Australia. So was Samuel
Barber’s American symphony in
one movement which followed.
A tranquil andante sounded
lovely, and all the more so be-
cause it was sandwiched in
between crescendoes which
sounded like empty oil-drums
being discharged on to the roof
of a galvanised-iron goods-shed.
Moussorgsky’s “Pictures at an
Exhibition,” arranged for orches-
tra by Goehr, concluded the
proceedings. The music inspired
by Victor Hartman’s pictures
was probably better than the
paintings.
* * * *
There was an unprecedented
rush of youthful talent to the
Town Hall, Melbourne, for the
final of the concerto competition
of the University Conserva-
torium and the A.8.C., and a
packed house greeted the starters
in the musical stakes with loud
approval. The largest serving of
it went to Harriet Nemenoff, a
Russian youngster born in
Turkey, whose choice of subject,
Armenian Khatchaturian’s piano
concerto, was equally exotic.
She played it with vast aplomb
and a sensitiveness that doesn’t
usually come to a virtuoso until
his mature years.
Sydney MacEwan.
Father Sydney Mac Ewan is
not a spectacular tenor —in his
two Sydney recitals it is doubt-
ful if once he went above G—
but within the range embraced
by the setting of all his Celtic
songs there is a ringing reson-
ance which springs from fault-
less and facile production, and
a complete absence of any striv-
ing after effect. His is the easiest
singing imaginable to look at
and listen to, and his enuncia-
tion is music within itself.
It is not until such recitals as
these are given by a singer who
has made a life study of his
songs that audiences are made
fully aware of the many-faceted
beauties of the homely songs of
the Outer Hebrides, of Cale-
donia and of Ireland —such airs,
for instance, as Tom Moore’s
“Love Thee Dearest,” to which
the singer lent fine legato phras-
ing, and the traditional one of
Donegal, “She Moved Thru the
Fair,” notable for the splendidly-
controlled half-voice in the final
measures. “Wee Morag” and
“Island Moon” were salted with
the winds that blow off the Isle
of Lewis. “Bonnie Earl of
Moray” and “Bonnie George
Campbell” were touches of
nicely-judged drama from the
North. Exactly the right degree
of banting humor was infused
into “Star of County Down”
and “The Short Cut to the
Rosses,” the fast pace accentu-
ating the perfection of the enun-
ciation.
John Douglas Todd, alert
and sympathetic in his accom-
panying role,- punched out a fine
roll of sound in De Falla’s
’“Ritual Fire Dance,” turned with
equal authority to the misty im-
pressionism of Ravel’s “La Val-
lee des Cloches,” and left no
loose ends in Schumann’s
Novelette in F Major.
Dangerous Fairies.
Possibly the best thing to do
with the fairies in “A Midsum-
mer Night’s Dream” would
be to boil them; for, as in
May Hollinworth’s Metropolitan
Players’ performance at Reiby-
place, they have an unfortunate
habit of seeming not to be fairies
at all but pretty little girls.
Pretty little girls are charm-
ing creatures —but dominating.
They insist on being shepherded
on and off stage with matronly
gestures ; and so Titariia, though
Dorothy Hunter succeeded in
looking fey as well as matronly,
forgets that she is wicked and
wanton.
They insist, one suspects, that
they shall not be shocked. And
so when Hermia is telling Ly-
sander to go away and sleep by
himself Robin Lovejoy is, in
any case, decorously kneeling a
yard away; and when Quince,
Snug, Flute, Bottom and Co.
are playing, merrily enough,
with the wall, there is nothing
to indicate that the scene is
really as broad as a sketch by
Mo.
They insist, indeed, that all
the humor should be designed to
appeal to small fairies. So that
although Lionel Bain was a bold,
brawny and amusing Bottom,
most of the bumpkins were
weak.
And finally, perhaps, they
insist that nobody except them-
selves shall take his part quite
seriously; shall really strive to
wring the last drop of richness
out of the characterisation, the
ultimate depth from the poetry:
for Frank Waters, playing a
good straightforward Theseus,
should obviously have allowed
poetry to creep in when he came
to “Chanting faint hymns”;
and James Marsh, playing too
grey a version of Hermia’s heavy
father, should have got a lot of
fun out of his luscious contempt
for nosegays and other tokens
of youthful joy.
The actors who stood out
were those who defied the fairies
and played their characters to
the full: John Meilion, who
gave Puck an Australian accent
that suited his larrikin tempera-
ment ; Kenneth Pawley, who
knew that Oberon has much in
common with the devil; Chris-
tina Walsh, who did not like
being scorned in the woods ; and,
especially, Paula Denyer, who
did not like being called a dwarf
and who did not altogether dis-
like being loved by Demetrius
as well as Lysander.
The speed of the production,
as well as the fairies, may have
had something to do with pre-
venting it from rising above the
lightly charming. Dispensing
altogether with intervals, May
Hollinworth put a girdle round
the play in about 100 minutes —-
a beautifully smooth perform-
ance, therefore lacking some-
thing of the roughness of con-
viction.
Cicely Courtneidge received
an ecstatic welcome from Bris-
bane audiences at His Majesty’s
Theatre. It is a joy to watch
someone with such precise
knowledge of what to throw
away and what to retain in
comedy - playing. “Under the
Counter,” slight comedy though
it is, is an almost perfect vehicle
for displaying Miss Courtneidge’s
talents. The music and dancing
enter naturally enough into the
plot, and the three or four “num-
bers” are well done. Leading
man Thorley Walters has a plea-
sant personality and more than
compensates for a lack of danc-
ing ability by playing a couple of
the quieter scenes with complete
sympathy.

Brisbane Repertory’s second
production for the year was
Emlyn Williams’s “The Wind of
Heaven.” Set in a Welsh village,
about 1856, it concerns a group
of people who find themselves
caught in a situation beyond
their comprehension. A worldly
circus proprietor, with his
major-domo, arrives a£ the house
of an embittered widow. He
is mainly concerned with the
discovery and exploitation of
freaks, and by an odd chance he
has heard of a little man who,
it is said, can conjure music out
of the air, and who is believed
to live somewhere in this remote
part of Wales. How he finds his
“freak” and, incidentally, his
own soul is finely and fluently
told.

The Northwood Group’s
paintings, on exhibition at the
Macquarie Galleries, Sydney,
include a New Zealand land-
scape by Roland Wakelin, a self-
portrait by John Santry, a sketch
of members of the group by
Marie Santry, landscape by
Lloyd Rees and slums by George
Lawrence. Of George
Lawrence’s slums it can be said,
at least, that they have form and
character and a certain drama
which might have been
heightened if the artist had
painted a real sky; or, conced-
ing his sky to be real, if he had
painted a burning blue Aus-
tralian summer sky for the sake
of dramatic relief. Skies, again,
are weaknesses in Lloyd Rees’s
landscapes. Roland Wakelin’s
excellently - constructed “Near
Silverstream” loses full poetic
impact by a lack of life. Some
good Wakelin landscapes are
contrasted with his “Maori-
vbank,” in which impressionistic
tendencies have run riot, result-
ing in woolly clouds and a
stream where light has been en-
larged to the proportions of con-
fetti. John Santry’s portrait,
with a cocked chin, is good.

Jessie C. A. Traill’s current
show at Kozminsky’s Lower Gal-
lery in Melbourne is at least
unique in subject-matter. On an
aerial trip from Europe she has
made a series of rapid sketches
of cloud, sea, ports and towns
passed. They go far enough to
show that it would probably take
a couple of centuries for an
earthbound population to change
its associations sufficiently to en-
joy a bird’s-eye view of its
natural habitat.


Women's letters
From Sydney
How does the Duchess of Grafton
think Randwick compares with Fleming-
ton? She was at Saturday’s Warwick
Farm meeting. She had been staying in
Melbourne before her visit to Grafton,
and only arrived by plane in Sydney on
Saturday morning. She wore a black
suit, and her black beret carried a soft
plume at the right side. Another notable
renewing acquaintance with Randwick
was Mrs. Lawrence Byrne, remembered
as Mrs, Eric Sheller. With her was her
sop Leslie Walford. Mrs. Leslie Friend’s
suit was brown and her toning beret was
stabbed by two quills.
There wasn’t an empty seat in the Con-
servatorium for the recitals given by
Father Sydney Mac Ewan. This lyric
tenor who sings as effortlessly as flow
the tides among his beloved Hebridean
isles met with a grand reception. And
for added warmth the whole of the Con.
stage was peopled with eager listeners —
all but the small section taken up by the
grand piano, the singer, the tall and very
slim musician John Douglas Todd and
the microphone. Author Compton Mac-
kenzie says of the tenor that he is the
best singer of Irish and Scots songs since
John McCormack himself. Incidentally,
it was John who plucked Father Mac-
Ewan from school teaching in Glasgow
and not only advised him to take up sing-
ing but actually coached him. Anyway :
the Scots listeners thrilled to the first half
of the opening programme, with its songs
of the Hebrides and its songs of the Isle
of Lewis, and the Irish felt their hearts
melting to Tom Moore’s “Meeting of
the Waters” and “The Irish Emigrant.”
But here and now this writer would like
to ask ladies who have been carefully
guarding their fur coats or fur-collared
coats from moths during the winter by
mothballs or spray to air the garments
for an hour or two before wearing it
to a concert. The effect is almost lethal
on their neighbors east and west, north
and south.
At 12 (noon) on Friday the Town Hall
doors will be thrown open for the Every-
woman’s Meeting arranged by the Aus-
tralian Women’s Movement Against
Socialism. This movement is getting along
very nicely, thank you, and every day
more recruits and more funds are foiling
up. Mrs. Crawford Vaughan (Miss Pres-
ton Stanley) is the campaign director of
the movement, and energetic Phyllis
Parkinson its honorary secretary-general,
and they work away up in the Trust
Building. They have got out a very force-
ful literature against socialisation from
the point of how it will hit the housewife.
They have already lit to enthusiasm a
circle of women whose homes ring this
city and who are holding afternoon meet-
ings in them. Not only is the Gospel
preached therein but contributions for the
general funds are dropped into the plate
—in these cases that is generally an orna-
mental bowl. Anyway, you can hear Mrs.
Preston Stanley Vaughan telling you all
about the movement on Friday in the
Town Hall. Strella Wilson and other
well-known artists will provide musical
entertainment.
Mrs. Geoffrey Bernays (Jane Bernays
to her friends, who are uncountable) has
achieved one of the dreams of her life.
Jane has always wanted to own a few
racehorses of her own. Well, a while ago '
she bought Black Pearl, and entered it
for the Newcastle Cup —its second big
race since Jane’s ownership. And Black
Pearl romped home first, thereby making
Mrs. Bernays the proud possessor of a
glittering canteen of cutlery in addition
to the prize-iponey.
Tommy Cochran dropped a line as he
went off to Melbourne in the Orion:
“ ‘No orchids for Miss Blandish’ is a
good slogan for au-revoir messages from
travellers going overseas. Otherwise the
Harbor is Strewn with useless flowers
dubbed ‘the steward’s curse’ by the ships’
staffs.” Well, that’s a debatable point.
Your seasoned voyager may feel that
way about it, but the lass leaving Port
Jackson for the first time likes to get her
quota of blooms. Indeed, not long ago
there was a story whispered of a young-
ster not sure of her own flower-drawing
capacity who ordered four lots to be sent
to herself. They duly arrived; so did
about a dozen others. Said the traveller’s
sister: “Well, I paid for the four posies
she had sent to herself, but it was worth
it. And when the genuine flower fare-
wells arrived she looked as happy as a
film-star.”
The Society of Arts and Crafts of New
South Wales announces correspondence
courses in “Design and Color” and
•‘Fabric Printing.” The Design and Color
course consists of ten lessons. It sets out
to give the general principles of design
and color as a source of refreshment for
the imagination and lays the foundation
for more advanced work. The fee for a
course of ten lessons (materials included)
is £6 6s. The Fabric Printing course
(from lino.-cuts) consists of three lessons,
and the fee is £4 4s. In each course exer-
cises are set for each lesson, and indi-
vidual criticism will be given for each
paper returned. Full particulars of these
courses and of the studio classes at
Double Bay can be obtained from the
secretary, Society of Arts and Crafts of
N.S.W., 112 a King-street, or from the
Bursar of that society, 114 Hopetoun-
avenue, Vaucluse. The aim of the classes
and the courses is to encourage apprecia-
tion of traditional, primitive and peasant
art all over the world, to make the student
actively aware of beauty in nature, art
and literature, and of the fine and honest
in craftsmanship.
A bit of Sydney of the late ’nineties
and of the present time slipped into the
yesterdays last week. The death of
Thomas Herbert Kelly (known to his
friends as Bertie) has taken from the city
one of its consistent patrons of the arts.
Apart from his business activities, “which
were many and widespread, Bertie Kelly’s
interests spread from rowing to viola-
playing. In between were the drama, the
opera and the ballet. He and Mrs. Kelly
(well known before her marriage as an
actress throughout America and Aus-
tralia) were not only first-nighters at the
big shows ; they were to be seen over a
number of years in the audience of the
small .amateur groups. Sydney Gram-
mar, Eton and Oxford were the educa-
tional background of this Australian
gentleman.
Dr. Ruth Bacon is a woman who has
adorned the inside of her head as well as
the outside. Dr. Ruth is the one woman
delegate out of 28 who arrived in Sydney
last week for the South Pacific Commis-
sion’s Conference. She is a doctor of
Philosophy and political science, and in
Washington she holds high position on
the staff of the director of the office of
Far Eastern Affairs. Her work has
already taken her to China, Japan and
Korea. After this conference she goes to
Siam and the Philippines. Dr. Bacon is
young, slim and dark-eyed and has a
pretty taste in hats.

a hero —Lady Mountevans, who, with
her husband, Lord Mountevans (Evans
of the Broke), has been an attractive
guest-of-honor at many recent Sydney
parties. Norton Trevaire photograph.
One roll of parchment that is as prized
as any illuminated medieval MS is a
letter written from Buckingham Palace
by the Duke of Edinburgh to the Joe
Fallons, of Sydney. Their wedding pre-
sent to the Royalties had included some
Australian blankets. In his letter thank-
ing them for the gift the Duke said that
at present the blankets were packed
away, but when “we get a house of our
own” they would be among the first
things unpacked. Well, well; the housing
problem is no respecter of persons. High
and low, rich and poor join in the re-
frain “a house of our own.”
Another passenger in the Orion
was Mrs. Frank Osborne. One of her
favorite plays is Barrie’s “Twelve Pound
Look,” but that has changed in her mind
to “The Twelve Thousand Pound Look,”
as her son Richard has won this amount
in a lottery. He has named his Collaroy
dwelling after his former station Bengara-
long. Among Mrs. Frank’s farewell gifts
some practical friends had sent two food
parcels.
Do not forget Tuesday, June 1, and
Nina Fawsitt’s “The Wicked Witch,” an
original fairytale, words and music by
Mrs. Fawsitt, already known as a com-
poser of songs for little ones. The Spastic
Centre, Mosman, benefits.
From Melbourne
Erna Berger, who sang Gliere’s Con-
certo for Coloratura and Orchestra with
the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra
under Bernard Heinze, completely capti-
vated the big audience at the Town Hall
with her personality and the beauty of
her voice. Among those who enjoyed the
feast of song were Mrs. A. E. V. Richard-
son, whose gown of midnight-blue crepe
romaine was trimmed with rhinestones
and worn under a full-length fur coat;
Mrs. Edmund Aldock in a filmy black-
net gown and dyed ermine coat; Bonnie
McCallum, whose gown was of black
lace ; Mrs. J. R. Stable, a study in mist
blue; Edna Glasscock in sage-green
tailored coat. Rhoda Taylor was in a
party which included Mr. and Mrs. Basil
Hart,
Inez Lillies, the subject of this Athol
Shmith photo., is the elder daughter of
the late Sir Stanley Argyle, one-time
Premier of this State, and Lady Argyle,
who now lives in W.A. Inez was for
some time her father’s secretary, and
travelled with him on a few of his cam-
paigns all over Victoria. For the past
six years she has been press-relations
officer with J. C. Williamson’s, but she
has now relinquished that post to start
on her own. Early next year famous
Polish artist Feliks Topolsici will tour
here under her direction, and he will do
an Australian Spectacle on the same lines
as his well-known London Spectacle;
this is just a collection of sketches of
ordinary folk going about their daily
business and odd bits of the country. He
will show at George’s in this city and at
David Jones’, Sydney. In between
preparations for his visit Inez is busy
writing a book which she has called The
Autobiography of an Ass, and covers her
experiences with the press and people
she has met. She is the wife of Esmond
Lillies.
Guests arriving at the St. Kilda Town
Hall for the Coral Sea Ball were at once
transported to the warmth and glamor
of a tropical island. They were greeted
by girls wearing gay sarongs who sold
them leis with a lucky number attached ;
the tropical-island 'market, with its bam-
boo hut and baskets of fruit, did a busy
trade. Mrs. R. G. Casey, who with her
husband, the president of the Australian-
American Association, received the guests,
wore an attractive black slipper-satin
gown with a very full skirt and matching
little fitting jacket. Also in the official
party were the Lord Mayor, Sfr Raymond
Connelly, and his wife, her brown net
gown brightened by a gold sequin design
on the skirt and bodice and worn with
a matching jacket. Air Vice-Marshal
Jones came with his wife;, her choice a
bouffant gown of white broderie Anglaise.
Mrs. Stephen Jurika, wife of the U.S.
Naval Attache, wore a black taffeta
dinner-gown and short jacket. Mrs.
Ralph Michaelis, wife of Col. Michaelis,
U.S. Army Air Force Attache, favored a
gown of pink-and-white check gingham
with a fichu collar and side drapery of
blue-and-white check gingham. Col.
Hester, U.S. Military Attache, danced
with his wife, she in a gown of pastel-
blue moire taffetas. Mrs. Sam Sauer,
wife of Col. Sauer, chose a white-slipper
satin gown and hip-length black velvet
coat with white-satin facings.
Mrs. Harold Rabling’s white crepe
romaine gown had trimmings of emerald-
green sequins. Another American, Mrs.
W. Graves, wore an ensemble of Ameri-
can Beauty crepe romaine, the front of
the bodice and shoulders of the match-
ing short jacket trimmed with white
beads. Mrs. Colin Macfarlan wore a
Schiaparelli model of black taffeta, the
bodice with a low peckline, large tur-
quoise-blue taffeta bow on one shoulder,
the hem of the slim-cut skirt cut into
petals which-were lined with turquoise
blue. Mrs. lan Thomson struck a patri-
otic note With her white crepe skirt, royal-
blue jacket and large shoulder spray of
red, white and blue flowers. Rhoda Tay-
lor, organiser of the ball, wore a strik-
ing 5 gown of flame-toned chiffon, the
bodice strapless and bands of Oriental
embroidery embellishing the full skirt.
Mrs. Herbert Pacini’s pastel-green satin
gown was matched with a small hip-
length jacket. Peggy Purbrick’s deep-
brown net gown with its gold trimming
was worn with a gold-toned ostrich-
feather hair ornament. Mrs. Ralph Hunt,
wife of the U.S. Consul, wore a navy-
and-white spotted dinner-gown, a white
collar and facings highlighting the simply-
cut bodice.
When Peggy, elder daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. F. W. Mollard, of Caulfield,
was married at St. John’s, Toorak, she
wore a pearl-tinted slipper satin gown, the
long sleeves cut in points over the hands,
the full skirt falling in soft folds to a
train. A design of gardenias sewn in
pearls defined the square neckline of the
bodice; a coronet of orange blossoms
secured the veil, and the bride carried
a bouquet of gardenias. Her ’groom,
Henry Meredith, is the only son of Mr.
and Mrs. H. M, Day, of Toorak. Mrs.
John Watt was her sister’s matron-of-
honor; Alice Carse was bridesmaid, and
the bridegroom’s small niece Anne,
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J! C. Crawford,
of Adelaide, was trainbearer. Victorian
posies of pale-pink and white hyacinths,
nerines and carnations were carried by
matron-of-honor and bridesmaid, who
wore white georgette frocks which fea-
tured tight, swathed bodices and very full
skirts. Little Anne carried Cecile Brunner
roses with her short white organdie frock,
which was smocked with pink at the
shoulders and had frills at the hemline.
Keith Davies was best man and Jim Ein-
siedel groomsman. Over 200 guests were
entertained at a reception at the home of
the bride’s parents.
Tailored tweeds were the favorite to
withstand the cold biting wind that swept
the paddock at Flemington on Saturday,
and checks are much in favor. A smart
suit was worn by Mrs. M. Healey.
Patterned in dog’s-tooth, its blues and
greys sorted well with the little navy
sailor hat trimmed with matching gros-
grain ribbon. Mrs. Fred Hammond’s
suit was navy, her small navy hat lined
with Chartreuse straw under the brim and
one side of the crown embellished with
Chartreuse feathers. Mrs. George
Davies’s black Persian-lamb coat was
worn with a black cloche hat trimmed
with upstanding black coq feathers.
Mrs. Les Sangster’s black tailored suit
had trimmings of black Persian-lamb,
also used to face her black hat. Mrs.
Vernon Duckett’s suit was of buttercup-
yellow wool trimmed with beige fox-fur ;
her small burnt-straw hat was rose-
trimmed. Lady Robinson’s tailored coat,
fitted at the waist, was of mushroom-
pink corduroy velvet; her hat in the same
toning was trimmed with satin ribbon.
Ann Newbigin was tailored in navy ;
Sylvia Clancy pepped up her black suit
with a rose-pink felt hat trimmed with
veiling in the same shade. Mrs. Bert
Chadwick added a green-ribbon-trimmed
straw hat to her tailored black suit.
Last week women scribes were guests
at three parties. At the first the Lord
Mayor, Sir Raymond Connelly, formally
introduced his wife to them. Lady Con-
nelly, who made a modest little speech in
response to one by Sir Thomas Nettlefold,
wore a soft beige frock and matching
hat. Later presswomen foregathered in
the Australia as guests of Evie Hayes,
who was saying goodbye before going on
to Adelaide, where “Annie Get Your
Gun” is due. Evie showed her flair for
smart dressing by wearing a full-skirted
jacket suit of bottle-green and a wide
matching felt hat. The third party was
to that very vital and stimulating person
Cicely Courtneidge. Trying to get near
Cicely here was almost as difficult as
getting tickets for the Old Vic. show.
Cicely Courtneidge’s antics delighted
the big audience at His Majesty’s on the
opening night of “Under the Counter.
Lady Dugan wore a gown of sage-green
crepe which was ornamented with sequins.
Mrs. Les Coleman’s bouffant gown of
pastel-pink marquisette had a tight-fitting
bodice of black Chantilly lace; bands
of the lace were let into the skirt. Mrs.
Garnet Carroll’s full-length white panne
velvet coat was worn over a white gown
and she carried a tiny pillow muff sof
white ermine. Over the black velvet
gown worn by Elsie Byer, manager of
the Old Vic. Co., was a phantom beaver
coat, Lillian Wightman chose a hip-
length black Persian-lamb coat to wear
over her black gown ; her muff was of
similar fur. Mrs. Rupert Downes’s mist-
blue wool was trimmed with silver
sequins. Elizabeth Simpson’s black velvet
gown featured white-ermine puff sleeves.
Grace Harrison wore a mink coat over
her mushroom-pink evening gown, the
skirt of which was cut on the new
“harem” lines. Betty Jones’s short black
georgette frock was worn with a grey-fox
cape. Her mother, Mrs. T, J. Jones, was
also in black and wore a dyed ermine
coat. Eileen Hattam’s gown and short
jacket were of hyacinth blue and silver
lame. Mrs. Charles Davis added brown
musquash to her black flat-crepe dinner
ensemble.

THE SERVICE MAN
The U.S.S.R. and
Turmoil.
“Ek Dum”: Last week may
be remembered as one of the
definitive periods in the twen-
tieth century. The course of
history flowed still a little more
towards a possible third world
war. The curious trick played
by Moscow in publicly inter-
preting what was meant to be a
private warning by the United
States as an invitation to confer
in the interests of peace showed
the lengths in diplomatic trickery
to which Moscow is prepared to
go. On the very night on which
the Kremlin was deluging the
world with propaganda about
the significance of the supposed
United States approach—about
which the cunning innuendo was
propagated that it was dictated
by fear—satellite Russian radio
stations were lambasting Uncle
Sam as a vicious warmonger
bent on world conquest.
The timing of the trick was
also cunning. It was played at a
moment when a dozen live pre-
texts for active fighting were
maturing. The tale was issued
within the week in which the
Russian Government protested
against the executions of Greek
Communists, which many of the
Greeks’ own friends condemned.
Condemnation by the U.S.S.R.,
which in 1938 murdered over
64,000 of its own officers from
the Commander-in-Chief down-
wards without public trial and
which is responsible for the
wiping-out of tens of thousands
of innocent Balts, was a piece of
sickening hypocrisy.
The incident happened also in
the week when contention was
about to break out between the
United States and Russia about
the latter country’s brazen
breach of its agreement to
repatriate 50,000 Japanese
prisoners-of-war, whom it cap-
tured without fighting in 1945
and whom it has held ever since,
long a£ter other large masses of
Jap prisoners were sent home.
At the moment of the issue
of the propaganda serious argu-
ments were brewing in Korea,
where the Russians and the
Communist People’s Committee
of Northern Korea, their puppet,
are doing their best to force the
Americans out of the country
and engulf the south as part of
the new Soviet satellite state.
In Berlin tension was reaching
breaking-point. The Russians
rushed shouting from a meet-
ing of the Public Safety Commit-
tee of the Four Power Kom-
mandatura, called out by the
Russian Chief of Staff. The Rus-
sians were involved in an attempt
to secure police control of the
whole of Berlin through the ap-
pointment of a Moscow nominee.
These events were accompanied
by an extensive Russian purge
of officials in the Berlin zone, by
the recall of Comrade Gromyko
from U.N.O. qnd his replace-
ment by a lesser light, one Malik,
by the disappearance of a
British officer, Lt.-Col. Klein,
who had been acting as a link
with the Russians, and by the
escape of a Russian officer in
the American North Sea zone
who, for some reason, was averse
to spending his holidays in his
native land and preferred to seek
hurried sanctuary in England.
Some people have a curious
aversion to being bumped off.
Finally there were Palestine
and the silent tussles in progress
over Trieste and over Abyssinia,
where a fierce effort of the first
magnitude is being made to es-
tablish Communist influence as a
jumping-off group for the com-
munisation of Africa.
That can lead to serious
trouble, especially if the Arab-
Jewish war develops according
to promise, with Russia as a
silent intervener.
There is no doubt about the
fact that the U.S.S.R. has been
fanning the flames of war in
Palestine for its own sinister
purposes. The cargoes of Jews—
or alleged Jews —who have been
sent to Palestine in the past few
months in defiance of the British
mandatory authorities could
not have left their original slave
States save with the help and coun-
tenance of their Governments.
Export of the Jew or alleged
Jew has always been a Soviet
method of getting agents into a
country in which operations are
contemplated. There was an
influx of these people into South
Africa before the 1922 Com-
munist rebellion on the goldfields.
Apd there is strong suspicion
that a lot of people who are
going into Palestine are no more
Jews than the Molonys of Bally-
bunion. There is room for un-
easiness that one day reconsti-
tuted Palestine may wake up to
find itself burning with Com-
munist ardor and admiration for
the Great Stalin.
War in Palestine.
“Ek Dum”: At 8 a.m. Sydney
time on May 15 Britain’s
Palestine Mandate ended.
The day before Sir Alan Cun-
ningham, the High Commis-
sioner, left Jerusalem to the skirl
of pipes, flew to Haifa with an
escort of Lancasters and Spit-
fires and, passing through a
crowded which had called
a truce to scrimmaging to see
him go, boarded the clean-
lined little cruiser Euryalus—
she is sister to Black Prince,
very familiar in Sydney Harbor
during the Pacific war.
The saluting guns crashed out,
the Spitfires dipped their wings,
the ship made for sea. All
British activity save that con-
nected with evacuation ceased.
Among the figures on the
wharf one could imagine the
ghost of T. E. Lawrence, feet
apart, hands hanging down
clasped in front, jaw set. In
August, 1926, he told the writer
of this article: “The Palestine
arrangement is rickety. Within
25 years it will blow up and the
whole of the Near and Middle
East may go up with it.”
He would not have agreed with
Mr. A. V. Alexander that there
was nothing in the conduct of
the British in Palestine of which
any Briton need be ashamed.
Speaking purely of a gallant sol-
diery it was true. But the be-
trayal of the promises which
brought the Arabs into World
War I was no credit to the Gov-
ernment which broke them. And
the surrender of the Suez Canal
zone and Palestine itself was
far from a credit to the present
Government, which was accused
recently by a Russian propagan-
dist of having “crawled out of
the Haifa end of the oil pipeline
and decided to go home.” The
pitiful manner in which the
Attlee Government has thrown
up its hold on an area which is
the very lifeline of the British
Commonwealth is something for
which the whole world will pay,
Australia not least.
The height of the present
British Government’s feebleness
and futility was illustrated by
the Colonial Office statement
issued on the day of the High
Commissioner’s evacuation in
which it was said that there had
been 84,000 British troops in
Palestine, but that without the
co-operation of the Jewish com-
munity this was insufficient to
keep order in the face of a
terrorist campaign waged by a
highly-organised Jewish force.
The number quoted was equal
to one soldier to every eight
Jews, men, women and babies
in arms included. Something
must have gone wrong with the
JBritish soldier if the Colonial
Office excuse is true.
The Arab League declared
hostilities formally open in a
statement issued by its secretariat
on May 14. The league in-
cludes Egypt, Transjordania,
Irak, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi
Arabia and Yemen.
Fighting Begins
The Arabs wasted no words
after the declaration of the new
State of Israel by the Jews,
though fighting cannot have de-
veloped as intensely in the time
and with British troops still in
some parts of the country as the
daily newspapers would have
their readers believe. In print the
war sounded, 24 hours after the
British flag came down, like a
cross between Normandy, 1944,
and the Somme, 1916, with both
sides winning.
The truth was that on May 17
operations had only begun, and
there were as yet only a few
Arab troops on the fringes of
strategic areas, and fighting
otherwise merely where internal
pockets of Arabs were being
dealt with by the surrounding
Jews, or vice versa.
The drives which were in pro-
gress were:
(1) By a couple of brigades of
Egyptians from the south along the
Serbonian coast into the A.l.F.’s old
stamping-ground. This force was re-
ported to have taken Gaza, which is
about 20 miles inside the border, and
wiped out some Jewish settlements.
(2) The forces from the Arabian
peninsula—Yemen and Saudi Arabia
“Permission to keep a pet, Sir?”
—were moving in slightly to the north
of the Egyptian push. Their main
transport line is the Medina railway
and the caravan road which runs
almost parallel to it’ from Ma’an
right down to Yemen, which lies near
the mouth of the Red Sea.
(3) King Abdullah’s troops, with
the Irakis, are driving from Trans-
jordania across the Jordan, appar-
ently just south of the Sea of Galilee,
to cut the Jewish State in half be-
tween Haifa and Tel Aviv, which has
been declared the temporary capital
of Israel.
(4) The Syrians and Lebanese are
driving into the Plain of Sharon
through Galilee from the north.
Their immediate objective would be
the relief of Acre, which the Jews on
May 17 proclaimed themselves in
momentary expectation of capturing.
They were south of Galilee on Mon-
day and reported to be attacking Dan.
The whole of these forces is
under supreme command of
King Abdullah of Transjor-
dania.
Not much is known about the
armament and strength of the
invaders save that the Arab
Legion and the Irakis and Egypt-
ians are fairly well equipped
with British arms. The Egypt-
ians have some aircraft which
made four raids on Tel Aviv.
The Jews have some parachute
troops—they must haVe been
trained out of the country.
Interior Palestine, especially
the roads from the coast to in-
land towns, was a free-for-all,
and Jerusalem a solid melee as
soon as the British left.
The whole impression so far
is that each set of combatants
has little science but compen-
sating dash. Armament and
direction are likely to be the
essential factors, and if it is true
that Russian supplies are being
sent to the Jews through the
Dardanelles, it can be taken for
granted that Russian strength
and command will not be far
behind.
Railways and Defence.
“Ek Dum”: About the most
startling official pronouncement
for a long time is the N. S.
Wales Railway Department’s
declaration that it will not
release employees who wish
to join the Citizen Military
Forces.
Applications from workers
who have asked whether the De-
partment will give them leave to
attend camps has been met by
the terse response that, since
there is an acute staff shortage in
the railways, it is impossible to
release a large number of men
for 14 days, since their absence
from work would cause serious
interference with railway opera-
tion.
As 50,000 men are to be called
for from the whole of the Com-
monwealth, centres which previ-
ously had a battalion being re-
duced to a company, the num-
ber of men who are likely to
volunteer from the railways in
N. S. Wales will not be stagger-
ingly large. And as the railways,
in spite of their run-down con-
dition and expensive services
rendered, will have to be de-
fended just as much as any
other part of the country, one
would have imagined that thc«
department would be anxious to
have a leaven of young em-
ployees capable of handling
modern weapons and able to
take their place without pre-
liminaries in defensive units
whenever needed.
The department declares that
it will review its decision later.
It should review it now. It is
setting an unconscionably bad
example to private enterprise—
one which does little credit in-
deed to a Government depart-
ment.
An Example for
Canberra.
The United States Govern-
ment has awarded the Medal of
Freedom, with silver palm (one
of the highest decorations it can
confer upon a soldier of a
foreign country) on Lieu-
tenant-General Frank H. Berry-
man, General Officer Command-
ing Eastern Command, for “ex-
ceptionally meritorious service
which has aided the. United
States in the prosecution of the
war against Japan in the South-
west Pacific area from August
18, 1942, to September 2, 1945.”
The citation says:
General Berryman served initially as
Major-General, General Staff, Ist
Australian Army, which was charged
with the defence of North-eastern
Australia and preparation of Aus-
tralian and United States troops for
offensive operations.
In September, 1942, he was
appointed Deputy-chief of the Gen-
eral Staff,. Allied Land Headquarters,
responsible for the operations of
Allied ground forces in the South-
west Pacific Area, and subsequently
proceeded to New Guinea as Major-
General, General Staff, New Guinea
Force.
In each of these appointments his
professional ability resulted in out-
standing performance of service, and
his initiative and sound judgment
were to a great degree responsible for
the expeditious conclusion of the
Buna campaign and the destruction
of the opposing Japanese forces.
Later he was designated General
Officer Commanding, 2nd Australian
Corps, composed of Australian and
American units engaged in the Vitiaz
Strait operations, which under his
able leadership rapidly and efficiently
carried out the completely successful
series of operations which destroyed
the hostile garrison in the Lae and
Finschhafen areas, drove the enemy
from the Markham-Ramu Valley,
cleared the north coast of the Huon
Peninsula, and broke the Japanese
hold on the western shores of Vitiaz
Strait, vital to the Allied advance
into western New Guinea.
General Berryman was then ap-
pointed Chief of Staff, Advance
Echelon, Allied Land Headquarters,
and serving in this capacity in Hol-
landia, New Guinea, and later in
Manila, Luzon, Philippine Islands,
he ably and effectively co-ordinated
the operations of Australian Military
Forces with the overall plans ot
General Headquarters, South-west
Pacific Area. , ~,
Throughout the war the successful
and harmonious co-ordination ot the
combat efforts of Australian an
American forces was largely the re-
sult of General Ferryman s admini-
strative skill, broad professional
knowledge, keen perception, and un-
usual tact. By his outstanding ability
both as a staff-officer and a combat-
leader, his energy, initiative and re-
sourcefulness, and by his unremitting
devotion to duty, General Berryman
made a remarkable contribution to
the successful conclusion of Allied
operations in the South-west Pacific
Area.
General Berryman is a Dun-
trooner who served with distinc-
tion in World War I, but under
the disadvantages of the rule
which prevented graduates of the
new college from rising to the
higher ranks of command —an
artilleryman, he became brigade-
major to the Seventh Infantry
Brigade, A.1.F., after being in
the thick of fierce fighting.
In World War II he won his
spurs immediately as General
Mackay’s G 1 in the drive to-
wards Benghazi. He was in those
days one of the Empire’s most
enterprising staff officers, game
to try anything once. *He pro-
vided the heart of the 1940-41
plan for Bardia and the capture
of Tobruk. And afterwards, in
Syria with the Berry force, he
showed himself as tough a fight-
ing officer as he was a tactician.
These experiences were the basis
of his experience for the Pacific
campaign, and the Americans
had cause for gratitude in hav-
ing so seasoned, original and de-
termined an officer attached.
They, in this as in other cases,
were more generous than the
Australian Government, which
boorishly ignored or slighted the
services of senior officers in a
way which would have brought
a blush to the cheek of any
other Government. ,At least
three generals who took part in
the Pacific campaign would have
been knighted and received the
thanks of Parliament had they
served in the British Army.

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
This year it was South Australia’s
turn for the King’s Cup, run at
Morphettvilie on Saturday. As on
the two previous occasions when
Adelaide has had the race, the rich
prize this year went to a visitor
Valcurl. Phar Lap won his Cup there
in 1930, and Donaster his in 1936.
Carrying 9.5 under the quality con-
ditions, topweight this time was
Royal Gem; St. Fairy next with 8.13,
then Valcurl (8.8). Favorite was the
local candidate Beau Gem, but Val-
curl led all the way to beat the
favorite by a couple of lengths with
Sanctus third. Earlier in the week
Sanctus had taken the £3OOO Adelaide
Cup.
Valcurl presents the phenomenon of
a truly well-performed horse who
nevertheless always seems to be catch-
ing punters on me wrong foot. His
first success was as a tnree-year-oid
when he took the mile Chatsworth
Plate, starting at 20 to 1. Some
dozen subsequent wins have included
the Moonee Valley Cup at 25 to 1,
Bay View Handicap (10 to 1), Men-
tone Cup (25 to 1), another Moonee
Valley Cup (14 to 1), and Satur-
day’s King’s Cup 10 to 1. A
specialist at Mentone and Moonee
Valley, Valcurl this season lumped
topweight of 9.4 and failed by only
a head in an attempt to take his third
Moonee Valley Cup. Still, four pots
on the sideboard make quite a fair
show; and Valcurl’s stake-winnings
total a little short of £20,000.
* * * *
Racing in Sydney and Melbourne
on Saturday was in both cases at
“headquarters,” but in neither case
did the class of gallopers engaged
really measure tip to H.Q. standard.
In Melbourne, of course, followers
of the jumping game are wanning
up for their annual session, and
Saturday’s card at Flemington in-
cluded a Hurdle and a Steeple.
Cross-country rider R. Hall is
nowadays landing winners with the
consistent sureness which, a year or
so back, was Meenan’s prerogative.
Second favorite Repeater was Hall’s
mount in the B'arkly Hurdle and the
Enfield gelding scored a rather narrow
win from Gallant Gentleman (having
his first lash at the jumps) and
Ruthless.
The result of the Steeple was not
so good for punters. Favorite
Wangaratta was going like a
winner till he came down a
couple of furlongs from home, leav-
ing the 20-to-l chance Bronze Laddie
to fight out a thrilling finish with
Llandrillo, whom he beat a half-
length.
Trainer F. W. Hoysted continued
his remarkable run of successes in
juvenile events when the Tuhitarata
filly Trellis (D. Barclay) romped home
ahead of Najera and Gay Silhouette
in the Femdale Handicap. Hoysted-
trained two-year-olds have won 16
races and something over £12,000 in
stakes so far this season.
Successful in other events at Flem-
ington were Robert Bruce (N. Powell)
taking the 10-furlongs Koorlong Han-
dicap from Euxine and Gayness;
Reperio (B. Eames) scoring in the
Dingwell Welter with Sea Monarch
and Sir Charles in the places; and
John Law (L. Whittle) beating Space
and Promise You in the 14-furlongs
Cardinia Handicap.
* * * *
At Randwick, with several leading
jockeys absent, apprentice riders con-
tinued to get opportunities and to
make the most of them. Four of
the seven winners were ridden by
apprentices, who also took several
minor placings. J. Thompson rode*
a double, making even more secure
his' hold on the premiership.
The principal events attracted dis-
appointingly small fields. Eight faced
the starter in the Flying, which saw
Trover (A. Ward) lead nearly all the
way and fight on gamely at the finish
to down Earl Pentheus and Verbage.
Pufiham was favorite, but is evidently
not as reliable as of old. Only five
started in the Warwick May Handi-
cap (12f.), in which Piccolo (V. Had-
drick) also led throughout to beat
Spearex and Haxton. New Zealand-
bred Piccolo should win more races
during the winter, particularly when
rain has taken the sting from the
track, as was the case on Saturday.
There was no lack of acceptors for
the Two-year-old Novice, which had
to be divided. The first division
went to High Planet (T. Mullane),
a likely-looking son of High Caste
and a very easy winner from Crown
Sequel and San Mateo. For the
second division Vimy Ridge was an
odds-on favorite and appeared to have
the race well won at the distance but
stopped to a walk and was beaten
by Duke of Syke (R. Selkrig) and
All Bright. Another Novice, for
three-year-olds, went to Blue Danube
(J. Thompson).
Thompson’s other winning mount
was Oberon, who took the High-
weight. The consistent Midstream
mare Parramatoo had a well-earned
win in the Carlila Handicap (9f.) for
three- and four-year-old fillies and
mares.

Over in America to gather some
experience of cinder running-tracks,
Olympic sprinter John Treloar had his
first race on that surface on Saturday,
and, in what was more or less an
exhibition gallop over 100yds., clocked
9.55ec., one-tenth better than the
Australian record, which he has
equalled any number of times. Else-
where in the States Mel Patton, who -
will be Treloar’s toughest opponent
at the Games, covered the hundred
in 9.3, a new world record.

After throwing his clubs away and
making a general exhibition of him-
self in the Dunlop golf tourney in
England, Norman von Nida reeled
off 66-70-66-68 for 270 and first prize
of £s2sstg. in the “Daily Mail”
£2500 competition at Sunnfngdale. If
only the little man could control his
temper!

The Australians in England:
So far it’s been mainly massacre;
the tourists are carrying out to the
letter Bradman’s avowed intention of
rescuing the game from the doldrums
of stodgy “tactical” batting and the
inevitable dreary, drawn matches.
Victims last week were Surrey and
Cambridge. Mindful of the two drawn
games v. Surrey in 1938, Bradman
let the boys bat it but right to the
death for a total of 632; contributors
were Barnes (176), Bradman (146),
Hassett (110), Morris (65), Tallon
(50 not out) and Johnson (46). With
all agin him, Bedscr plugged away
stout-heartedly to take 4 for 104.
Australia won by an innings and 296
runs, after Surrey had collapsed for
141 and 195; Fishlock with 81 was
their best scorer in either innings.
There’s going to be a lot of confusion
about Johnson and Johnston before
the tour’s over; lan took 8 for 93,
and Bill, with the “t,” 4 for 55.
Morale of the Cambridge men must
have been sinking lower and lower as
their turn approached; they may have
been temporarily uplifted when Brad-
man decided to give the match a miss,
but Hassett, after winning the toss,
was able to declare with 414 on the
board’ for the loss of 4 wickets.
Affirming that he is peculiarly suited
by English conditions, Bill Brown
knocked up 200, and justified his
selection in the face of poor form at
home. With Colin McCool bagging
7 for 78 in the second innings and
Miller altogether mopping up 7 for
95, ’Varsity was routed by an innings
and 51 runs, scoring 167 and 196.
The real batting blitz, however,
was reserved for Essex,' the match
begun at Southend on Saturday.
Scoring at a rate of over two runs
a minute, the tourists, after winning
the toss, put up 721, a world-record
score for one day’s first-class play.
The weary Essex bowlers sent down
128 overs, four of which were
maidens. Bradman knocked up 42
in 20 minutes before lunch, including
five fours off one over, and carried
his total to 187. Brown made 153,
Loxton 120, Saggers 104 not out,
and Bames 79 before hitting his own
wicket; there’s no saying what the
total might have been had the prolific
Miller not been bowled first ball.

The Wallabies turned on a brilliant
exhibition of Union, under appropri-
ately brilliant lights, to beat Queens-
land 29-6 in a night match at Bris-
bane. Col Windon scored five tries,
In Sydney Union, Randwick beat
West 27-9 in a game bright with
individual efforts by Slattery, Cross
and others, but poor as a team game.
In other games, Parramatta beat
Drummoyne, 9-8; Manly beat East-
wood 9-6; Gordon beat Northern
Suburbs 20-3; St. George beat Uni-
versity 14-9.
* * * *
High winds, mostly across the
grounds, made sport of long kicks
in the V.F.L. games on Saturday,
but at Collingwood and Essendon the
crowds were treated to thrilling
finishes. ’Wood jumped away to a
4-goal lead over Carlton, were five
points down at the final change, and
then, against the wind, fairly slammed
their way through to win by two
points, 8.17-9.9. At Essendon, Rich-
mond Tigers “opened with a roar
and a rush,” but the ’Dons roared
and rushed back; and with Hutchi-
son and Reynolds scruffing the Tigers,
slapped on 3.4 to 2 points and made
it a draw, 13.17-14.11. The dis-
appointing Footscray went down to
"We'll get 'em to re-run that ten-miler — it's a dead-heat."
Geelong, 11.13-8.10; Fitzroy 15.19
bolted from Hawthorn 6.11; South
Melb. kicked 14.23 to St. Kilda’s
12.12; Melbourne had an outing
against North, 14.11 to 6.14.

For II of its solid 12 rounds the
Vic Patrick-Roy Treasure match at
Sydney Stadium was a good scrap,
with young Treasure absorbing all
Patrick’s best blows, returning them
in good measure and gradually los-
ing on points mainly because of his
inexperience of ringcraft. The final
round left a nasty taste in the mouth
after seeing Treasure semi-conscious
and clinging to the ropes for sup-
port, savagely bashed to the floor
with a ferocious battery of wild
punches, many of which landed in
supposedly-forbidden areas of neck
and back. Some excuse could be
made for Patrick, who had taken
enough punishment himself to be
somewhat befuddled and was acting
instinctively, but ref. Wallis should
have stepped in. Patrick was miles
ahead on points and the knockout
quite unnecessary.

To strains of “Should auld acquain-
tance be forgot,” Frank “Mahomet”
Donnelly (9.1 G) and Jackie Wilson
(9.5) met for the fifth time in the
roped square at Leichhardt. For mates
of such long standing, they gave
quite a creditable impression of de-
siring each other’s blood. Over the
final rounds, with a flaying of solid
swings, Donnelly finished strongly to
almost deserve a draw, but the lead
Wilson had established earlier, with
straight lefts and good evasive work,
gave him a narrow points decision.


ABORIGINALITIES.
“L.P.”: “YT watch must be cranky,”
Bluey growled when Old Jim, the engine-
driver-cwm-timekeeper, blew the knock-
off whistle at the Stringybark Creek
sawmill. “All this week you’ve been
slow.” “Get out!” Jim came back, full
of confidence. “My time’s right. Since
I've been timekeeper here I’ve always
checked my watch with the clock in
Dobbs’ store every evening and I’ve never
been a second out.” On his way home
Bluey dropped into Dobbs’s. “Your
clock’s a bit slow, isn’t it?” he asked. “It
shouldn’t be,” Dobbs answered, glancing
up at it. “For months I’ve been checking
it and putting it on by your knock-off
whistle up at the mill. It can’t be far
out.”
* * * *
“Gagi”: “Hanko’s” unscientific dashes
into bush and shrubberies to glimpse
nightingales and whip-birds performing
(B. 21/4/’4B) were unsuccessful for the
best of reasons. The nightingale and
whip-bird are ventriloquial, as are a
number of other birds and animals.
Among the’ latter the lion and hyena are
well-known examples overseas ; while any
Aboliar who has helped ambush a dingo
coming into sheep-country for its kill will
admit the cold shiver that runs up the
front-gunner’s spine when the brute slinks
into sight a fraction of a second after his
last howl has been heard, apparently a
mile off, in an entirely different direction.
Among fowl, the lyre-bird is the best-
known ventriloquist in Australia ; but the
prize for a skilful and purposeful per-
formance goes, in my opinion, to the
humble and harmless dollar-bird when its
mate has been killed or captured. Even
as the listener’s hat is knocked over his
eyes from behind by the wing of the
swooping bird, bent on revenge or rescue,
its call can still be heard in the top
branches of the nearest tree in front.
* * * *
“Salmon Gums”: “Nor’-west’s” frogs
and fishes, circulating in a waterspout,
may be, as he claims (B. 21/4/’4B), un-
harmed by the wind. The centre of such
disturbances is reputedly calm. But he
errs in crediting cyclones with a top-speed
of 70 m.p.h. A recent visitor to America
was clocked at double that speed, and, in
spite of the damage debited to it in its
course along the Mississippi, I doubt if it
exceeded the velocity of some of the willy-
willies that make sailing so interesting in
our northern waters. ITie blow that sank
the Koombana early in the century also
caught her sister-ship, the Bullara. With
her anchor out forrard on 180 fathoms
she steamed at 11 knots —and lost ground.
A 70. m.p.h. breeze would hardly ruffle
your hair. A cyclone can lift a bullock and
carry it out to sea ; and it is on record
that a Malay seaman, caught while aloft,
clung to the rigging, unable to move,
while the wind literally tore his ears from
his head.
* * * *
“Bosun's Atate”: Heeling properties of
destroyers (B. 5/5/’4B) remind me not
of centres of buoyancies and metacentric
heights, but the cruelty of. sending press
photographers to small ships and of the
toughness of pre-war typewriters. Re-
turning five years ago after 18 months
with the Eastern Fleet, we took aboard
in Melbourne the photographer, and ran
into a snorter off Jervis Bay. He was
game, that boy. When the Old Man sug-
gested that he put her hard-over for the
turn into Sydney Heads, to offer him a
picture of how a destroyer really could
roll, the cameraman lifted his head from
a bucket long enough to gulp that it was
a good idea. Down in my mess on a
battered desk my typewriter stood as it
had stood through 18 months' of storm
and porthole-spray. The Old Man in-
creased to 25 knots and put her hard-a-
port. Over she heeled, further, until the
lee scuppers were awash. The photo-
grapher followed his camera in a slither-
ing rush across the bridge and my type-
writer hit the deck 10 feet from the desk,
bounced on to a hatch-coaming and
jammed on the almost-horizontal ladder
to the deck below. There was no picture,
but my machine is typing this par.

“Old-timer”; Silent Nelson, accom-
panied by his swag and dog, appeared in
the bend one summer and shortly had
knocked up for himself a neat kipsie of
wood, bags and old iron—some of those
old Murray-side kipsies were good to live
in—and settled'down to calm life. He
made a few bob at odd jobs, presently
acquired some drum-nets and traps, a
horse and sulky. There his ambition
ceased, though not his silence, for he
had the fewest words of any man among
a notoriously silent class. The inhabitants
of Euston began to notice a peculiar thing.
About once every couple of months
Silent would invade the village, tie
horse, sulky and dog in the pub yard,
go round the place for all the old news-
“ Well , do We get that rise or don't We?"
papers he could get, retire to the river,
spend most of the day perusing them,
and then, with a gleam in his eye, pro-
ceed to get decorously drunk. A variety
of theories were advanced, but he’d been
repeating the process for nearly two years
before, in a moment of alcoholic impru-
dence, he confided in us. “I done a
duck,” he said. “I’rh lyin’ low from
me missus. Bit of a Tartar, she is.
Thought I was right till I see a notice in
a paper in a barber’s shop in Sale. One
o’ them lawyer things, it was, orderin’ me
to come back. Cotter watch the papers,
see? Never feel safe in a town unless I
have a good look through ’em first.” He
fell silent, as though -startled by his long
speech. “How long ago since y’ seen
it?” asked Punch. Silent screwed up
his face in thought. “Aw, musta bin eight
or nine years,” he replied.

“Boadeeseeher”: lam afraid that had
“Hanko” (B. 21/4/’4B) lived in the Rome
of the later b.cs, and the early a.ds. he
would have failed signally as a poultry
purveyor. For it is on recsrd that when
Lucullus and other senatorial gentlemen
wished to hit the really high lights, they,
at their banquets, loaded the tables with
pies, the chief constituent of which was
nightingales’ tongues. Now, since “H.”
wandered up and down- England without
catching even one nightingale, how long
would it have taken him to catch enough
to make a tongue pie?
* * * *
“X.Q.X.”: Those Diggers who were in
Syria also saw plenty of good dry-stone-
work (B. 28/ 4/ ’4B). The whole Lebanon
is limestone country, steep and with a
rich b.ut scanty covering of soil, and from
the coast to the mountain-tops every avail-
able foot is conserved by terraces. Beau-
tifully built of stone picked up on the
spot, on the steeper slopes the height of
the wall is often greater than the width
of the cultivated strip; even the gentlest
slope is guarded in this way against
erosion. Walls, houses, aqueducts are also
built of the stone, some of which is burnt
to provide the mortar, and many of the
structures are quite handsome. Near
Tartouss there is a belt of black basalt,
which does not split into slabs like
the limestone, but the buildings —the un-
lovely square, windowless type with a
central courtyard favored by the Arabs
everywhere—are built of the flattest stones
available, laid in a very effective herring-
bone pattern. As they cannot be made
to fit closely, the houses must be plastered
inside to keep out draughts. These people
know how to conserve moisture as well
as soil. Water from the snow-fed springs
of Lebanon is carried for miles by primi-
tive but effective ditches to water the
sheltered valleys and drive the machinery
of the silk-sheds. In the Bikr, the high
valley between the Lebanon and Anti-
lebanon, most of the streams drive a
watermill or two to the mile, the water
being picked up by a long stone viaduct
to give the necessary head. Between
Baalbek and Homs there is one of the
oldest man-made dams in the world. The
Lebanese, in particular, love their streams,
and wherever possible their inns are built
beside, or even overhanging, some pic-
turesque rivulet.

“Ned”; Sandy Jenkins had the best
farm on the creek, the best cows, pigs,
crops, savagest dogs, most powerful
tractor, a meek, hardworking wife and
a scared family of four sons and three
daughters who took no risks when there
was an extra rasp in Sandy’s crosscut
voice. He was also reputed to have sur-
reptitiously fed ginseng to his family to
ward off fatigue of body and mind. After
he had taken all awards with his Ayr-
shires and Poland-Chinas and scooped the
pool for cabbage, turnips, pumpkins, oats,
beets, corn, etc., he got the stockwhip to
his lads on the showgrounds because they
hadn’t produced half-a-dozen mushrooms
to win him another ten bob. On the way
home he pondered, but discarded, the idea
of running a flock of sheep on his creek
frontage. The Farquhars, who pastured
Corriedales across the stream, were
puzzled when they discovered that con-
siderable patches of their paddocks had
been swept clean. But the mystery re-
mained one until a night when the bright
moonbeams were reflected from some
shiny objects which bobbed about will-o’-
the-wisp-like on their flat. Without a
word Sandy’s scared-stiff brood of seven
shouldered rakes and half-filled sacks and
waded back across the creek, while
a sheepish Sandy, a gleaming kerosene-tin
in each hand, offered as an explanation
that someone had told him that whenever
sheep dung was dropped the soil would
produce an abundance of mushrooms.

“Alpine Willie”; Alec’s Brownie is a
sagacious hound. When a rabbit is put
up he makes a dive for the bit of cover
it came from, picks up the scent and fol-
lows the trail to one of the warrens.
There he sits with a comical, pleased ex-
pression at the particular opening where
the rabbit went to earth. “Now we’ve
got him, Alec,” Alec reckons Brownie all
but tells him. “I tracked the blankard all
the way an’ would know his smell agen
in a hundred. Now, ain’t that better’n
chasin’ him an’ not catchin’ him, like any
other silly damn dog would’ve done?”
* * * *
“X.E.D.”: Jim Barker was a renowned
eater of apples. He had a small orchard
beside his house, and they grew to per-
fection in the cool mountain valley.
Once an hour Tim’d produce a rosy-red
apple from one of his pockets or the
gunnybag he often carried, spit on it and
polish it on his trousers till it shone like
a new cricket-ball. Then he’d regard it
thoughtfully for a full minute before
sinking his strong, white teeth into it.
Once started, though, he seemed to lose
all aesthetic interest, munching like a
horse till core and pips disappeared.
“Ain’t nothin’ like apples f’r health and
long life,” Jim maintained, “Look at
Alf Perkins—92 next birthday an’ still
goin’ well.” “Square up, Jim,” I chipped
in. “Alf hasn’t had a tooth in his head
for the last 20 years, and he couldn't
chew an apple if he wanted to.” “No?
But he’s gittin’ false-teeth an’ is goin’
in f’r eatin’ all the apples he can,” Jim
maintained. “In another 10 years he’ll
be well over the hundred an’ just startin’
to get the full benefit of ’em. Gripes, he’s
good f’r another 50 years!”

“Goldie”: Exploring the slopes and
the old Golden Bell, Harry
used a sapling along the footwall as a
crossing over the open winze that yawned
from the black depths. The newchum re-
garded the business as decidedly risky.
“What’s goin’t’ happen if the stick breaks
or y’ slip orf?” he wanted to know.
Harry grinned and shone his light on a
timber prop about 10 feet over their
heads. “Soon as I felt meself goin’ I’d
spring up an’ grab that stull,” he said.
“I could easy hang on there till y’ got me
a rope t’ climb out.”
* * * *
“Moyhu”: Don’t know if he was any
relation to that cobber of “Zake’s” who
anointed his big toe with oil of aniseed
as a fish-lure (B. 5/5/’4B), but I knew a
• cove on the Upper Murray (Vic.) who
used to carry out a similar rite, squat-
ting in the river for hours, fully dressed,
hopefully awaiting the approach of a
20-pounder, the while impregnated with
the fatal odor of aniseed. Success
coming tardily, he impatiently grabbed
a yabby and, dipping it into the
aniseed pot, dived into the stream. They
found him a couple of weeks later in a
drum-net a few inches below the surface,
the yabby still clutched in his hand. A
fellow-prisoner, a 20-pound cod, was
cruising slowly round him, still sulkily re-
fusing the bait in spite of a 14-days fast.
* * * *
“Zake”: “Rawest newchum I ever
saw,” said The Whizzer, “was a cove
who came to us at Saddletop, straight
from the city. When the boss told him
to saddle Boxer up he evidently didn’t
like to say he’d never done it before, but
went and had a stab at it. About twenty
minutes later the boss goes down to the
stable to see what’s holding him up. The
newchum’s got the moke’s tail wet and
twisted round till the end comes to a
point, just like a woman does with a bit
o’ cotton she’s about to thread through
a needle; he’s holdin’ this straight out
with one hand and with the other he’s
holdin’ the loop of the crupper, an’ he’s
sayin’, ‘Whoa back, Boxer, whoa back! ’ ”
* * * *
“Wippegong”: The river is up. Nine
inches back on the range set the gullies
roaring, and now the main stream is
bloated and murky. Willows no longer
trail at the water’s edge but stand out in
the stream, piled with driftwood and
plastered with mud ; and a smooth, gentle
bevel straight across the current indicates
where the waters casually dismiss the weir
that usually holds them back. The oaks
that line the main stream and the old
watercourses are all awash, for the river
has surged over its banks and gone
racing along old channels; and in the
steady song there are reminiscent ripples
from the water mixed with chuckles from
the casuarinas as their roots drink deep.
A week ago the coot were tracing dainty
tracks as they swam patterns over the
nardoo-covered backwaters ; now the bul-
rushes that fringed those haunts are sub-
merged and the dusky fowl are racing
round the new margins, yelling to each
other about the pickings they’ve found.
On a temporary islet stand a cluster of
gleaming statues —white egrets; and
overhead a peculiar swishing rises
momentarily above the swirling of the
flood as a ragged wedge of 40 or more
black duck whistle over. A pair of dot-
terels flick by, calling plaintively, and
across their path a vivid flash lights the
course of an azure kingfisher; he pauses
on a low branch, hops around to look
downstream, faces about again and is off,
every quivering movement endorsing the
vocal whoops in which he is rejoicing over
having found his heaven. Already there
is teeming insect life over the waters, so
swallows in flocks indicate their indiffer-
ence to this migration convention by en-
joying the good going over midstream,
while peewees and Billy the Wag patrol
the fringes where the ripples die in the
weeds. A dozen blue herons skim along
the margin of the brimming billabong; I
can’t see them, for the sun is nearly down
and I’m facing it; but a dozen inverted
shadows flap heavily ‘ across the sunset
mirrored in the still water. In this quiet
reach one end is already dotted with
frothy frogs’ spawn, and next week you
will meet small boys with bottles full of
taddies. By then the river will be back in
its normal channel, smiling to itself after
its beautiful bender, while the waterfowl
shout fresh snatches of gossip through
the straightening reeds.
VAGRANT.
For two successive evenings, and quite near,
I’ve seen you now, you little, lonely thing.
When the whole western sky was still alight
With sunset fires, you’ve settled down each
night
On a low sunflower stem, with folded wing;
But what strange bird are you, who’ve wan-
dered here?
And whence came you—and why? Have you
no mate
To be with you? And how far have you come
All by your lonely self? Your name, your
kind,
Your picture I have sought but cannot find
In any book of bird-lore. Is your home
In distant parts? Has some strange play of
fate
Made you an exile from your kith and kin,
To fly unfriended in a land remote?
It seems you are no songster, for “Wack,
wack”
(Forgive me!) is not song. There is a lack
Of both variety and tone! That note
A minstrel’s name for you would never win.
A hunter of winged insects —am I right
lo think that’s what your look, your shape,
suggest?
Though you’ve no place in any book I know,
This place you’ve found, at sunset, twice; and
so
Should I know more than that a lonely guest
Seeks shelter here? Here rest you safe. Good-
night.

“Esk D.”: Harry Dodds is straining
the road fence when Parkins, the new
neighbor, pulls up and starts yarning.
“Mis’rable lot o’ cockies in these parts,”
he comments. “Too bloomin’ right they
are,” Harry agrees. “A bloke hasn’t much
chance of borrowin’ a cultivator or any-
thing,” Parkins goes on. “No one’d think
o’ givin’ y’ a helpin’ hand. That ain’t
neighborly, in my opinion. I’ve on’y bin
here a coupla munce an’ now I wouldn’t
have the heart t’ ask f’r the loan of an
implement. Things was different where I
come from.” “They’d need t’ be,” Harry
growls. “Yair,” Parkins says. “As I
was sayin’, no one ’d think t’ lend y’ a
cultivator, seein’ that I got a lot o’
ploughin’ t’ break up an’ none o’ me
own.” “It’s tough,” Harry agrees. “Well,
I c’d use a cultivator like the one you’ve
got right now,” Parkins says. “But I got
too much pride t’ go crawlin’ t’ me
neighbors. If they don’t care t’ lend me
one I’d just as soon tell ’em what t’ do
with it.” Conversation flags as Harry
works the strainer. When Parkins leaves
abruptly he watches him down the road
with a puzzled frown. “Funny sort o’
cove,” he. mutters slowly. “Gassin’ like
that about the neighbors an’ bowlin’ orf
like as if he’s got somethin’ on his mind.
I wonder what he wanted?”

“Gravelsnatcher”: The scarcity of
white horses among the heavier breeds is
due not so much to a theory of some
inherent weakness (B. 21/4/’4B) as to
the fact that they just don’t happen as
often as other colors. Which is reason-
able, seeing that there isn’t a heavy breed
that is naturally white. Yet a weakness
does exist. In white horses the pigment,
which should have gone to coloring the
hair, remains in the blood. This doesn’t
inconvenience the youngster, but as >t
ages this pigment lodges around the vent,
forming small, hard lumps which some-
times call for surgery. Apart from that,
a preference for any particular color is
largely a matter of prejudice. For my
part, I’ve never met a brown or a roan
who wasn’t honest, and I wouldn’t trust
a bay.

“Mat’s Mate”; We had inspected an
emu-bobbing contract, battled the owner
to a price and were set to start, so we
made for the local store, intending to
stock up with tucker, axes and a tent.
“No,” said the storekeeper, “I’m not
givin’ any credit unless Mr. Grabbit backs
“Quick, put it in low gear!”
it. You get him t’ guarantee it an’ y’ can
have what y’ want. Man’s gotter be hard,
Last blokes strapped up seven quids’-
worth o’ stuff on a yam like yours an’
ain’t bin seen since.” We made for
Grabbit. “What! ” said he. “Guarantee?
No fear. How do I know you’ll stop on?
How” “Come off it,” Mat growled,
“Howinell can we work without tucker
an’ clean up paddocks without axes?”
“I don’t know,” said Grabbit. We had
about Is. 9d. between us, and we needed
that job, so we spent our all on potatoes
and went out and toiled for a week, pick-
ing up and burning-off, manhandling logs,
living on potato stew and an occasional
rabbit caught in a log, without tea or
sugar or tobacco, and sleeping in the
open. After a week of it Grabbit came,
inspected the work, coldly informed us
that he only paid fortnightly but that he
would guarantee us at the store up to £4.
We cleared about £7O each, but it cost
us £3 18s. in court costs the day we got
settled up, Mat having sunk his big boot
in Grabbit’s rear. Still, it was worth it.

“Ex-Bluenose”; How deep does a whale
dive, or, to be technically correct,
“sound”? Records of the old whaling
days of W.A. show that not uncommonly
a harpooned whale took a mile of line
down with him. And that he went nearly
straight down was shown by his reappear-
ing close to the boat to which he was
fast. Lines used to be coiled in tubs, the
lead running out from the centre just as
does a properly-wound ball of string.
“Laying” the line into ,a tub was an art to
be learned, for a coil out of place would
have led to a tangle, the least result of
which meant the loss of the whale, the
worst the upsetting of the boat, with pos-
sible loss of life. The question of how
the whale can withstand the pressure and
intense cold of great depths is answered
by the thickness and texture of its blubber.
Blubber only a foot thick is thin. And
it is not “blubbery”—cutting into blubber
is almost as difficult' as cutting into crepe
rubber. This subcutaneous armor the
cetacean acquired a million years before
man forged a harpoon ; it is its defence
against the killer whale, which, being
streamlined for speed, lacks blubber, and
so cannot follow its quarry into the icy

“Flip”; Jim and Alf were plodding
the sticky clay road that leads into Bom-
bina. Jim, as usual, “had the floor.”
“Human footprints are interestin’ —tell
you all about who made ’em. I learned
to read ’em from an abo. Now look
down there —that small one with a little
heel-mark set back a bit. A casual
observer mightn’t notice that it’s a
woman’s print—and a city woman’s at
that; nobody in these parts would wear
silly shoes like them. I’d say from careful
readin’ of the prints that she was five
foot three, about eight stone four, left-
handed, twenty years old, blonde, and
has all her own teeth. I wonder what
she was doin’ out here?” Just then they
rounded the bend and came up with the
owner of the prints. It was old Harry
Barr, breaking in a swanky pair of riding-
boots. Harry, six foot one, twelve stone,
is righthanded, was 72 last birthday and
shed his last teeth and hair a decade or
two ago. Words failed Jim, but only
for a moment; as he passed he astounded
Harry with the roar: “You old pansy—
why don’t you wear proper boots? I
bet you’ve got socks on, too!”

“Anthropo”; Recent ,news from West
Africa told of the liquidation of members
of the Leopard Cult, a sanguinary secret
society. Which recalls that early settlers
on the Swan River made vague contact
with something similar among the Bib-
bulmun people. Here and there in the
early chronicles one finds references to
the “boolya-ga.” Members of this cult,
of which there were both old and young,
professed the power of sorcery—of im-
munity from ordinary weapons, and the
power of becoming invisible when on a
mission of vengeance. At the burial of
a warrior, should his death be considered
untimely, the “boolya-ga” undertook the
task of divining the direction from which
the death-dealing influence had come.
This' was usually accomplished by <|ight-
ing a small fire in the half-filled grave
and noting the direction in which the
first smoke drifted. Members of
“boolya-ga” stood by each other in times
of trouble. Also, since the cult had mem-
bers right through the nation, they could
find refuge even among the most distant
tribes. It was probably the “boolya-ga”
who wore those mystic kaditichta
slippers, the wearer being bent always on
an errand of death. More than one of
our explorers, making first contact with
an untouched tribe, met with hand-grips
and signs suggestive of freemasonry—
the identification signs of the “boolya-
ga.”

“Gumsucker”: Like “Hanko” (B.
21/4/’4B), I have friendly recollections of
“ He's been eating grasshoppers again!”
those hedges of prjckly acacia. Near our
home on the outskirts of Ballarat lay a
10-acre patch cultivated intensively by a
colony of Chinamen. All around grew
the prickly fence, capable, as was in-
tended, of repelling the predatory visits
of local “lallikins” intent on tomato,
watermelon, or even “callot” or turnip.
That was until close to the end of
summer, when, inevitably, the hedge
would take fire. And how excited those
Chinamen would become! With any and
every kind of dish or bucket they would
bail water from anywhere and race to
throw it on the flames. For years, all
through my boyhood, that hedge had
its annual burn-out. Then a genius arose
who suggested to the innocent Celestials
that they reinforce their hedge with black-
berry, which, of course, won’t burn. But
it was the end of the garden.
* * * *
“B. A. Ker”: When I was a boy the
belief was current that an escaped cage-
bird was doomed —“the sparrows will
kill him.” Until lately I had no reason
to challenge the supposition, although
I had wondered why spags didn’t attack
their piebald, snow-white and fawn-
colored brethren which on very rare oc-
casions could be seen flying with the
flocks. Recently the old belief got a
complete debunking. In the heart of a
flock of spags something blue caught my
eye; not until the little band had spread
over the grass could I identify the alien.
It was a blue budgerigar. A hooked
beak among broadbills, waddling though
the rest hopped, he was nevertheless un-
doubtedly accepted as “one of the mob”
as blue feathers confused with brown in
the scramble around some spilt millet.
Several days later I saw the blue bird
among a flock of sparrows nearly five
miles away —which seems to indicate that
foraging expeditions spread over a big
radius. Next day the flock was around
my back-door again, Bluey still with
them, completely oblivious of the chirp-
ings of his brethren in my spacious
aviary. A sieve, a stick and a pull-string
trapped him and three spags. His youth-
ful captor triumphantly added a new
budgerigar to the others in the aviary.
Bluey refused to chum up with his kin-
dred ; his days were spent hanging on
the wire waiting for his old mates to
arrive. When they did come he became
frantic in his efforts to reach them.
There was only one humane thing to do.
Every two or three days the flock re-
turns —a blue patch prominent in the
mottle of brown.

“Horseless Horseman” : v Why is it
sheepdogs are allergic to native porcu-
pines? Years ago on Tammit, on the mid-
Murray, every few months a spiny-ant-
eater would discover the homestead
around midnight, and those tykes that
failed to slip their collars developed laryn-
gitis from barking. The first time it hap-
pened we found several blood-nosed kel-
pies by the horse-yard burrowing for their
lives, while in the middle of a hole, 6ft.
in diameter and half that depth, a pin-
cushion-like form was sinking fast and
winning easily. To restore order at the
homestead we put the visitor, by means
of shovels and crowbars, in an old beer-
case, intending to let him go out on the
run later. When the cook got up he found
the ’pine had burrowed his way through
the bottom of the case and had gone bush.
Incidentally around Euston porcupines
seem to favor the dry Mallee scrub,
winter and summer. I’ve an inkling they
can go for weeks without water.
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: Such’s angler who
offered to bait the bloke’s line with
T.N.T., instead of gelignite, “if you want
something really big” (B. 10/3/’4B) evi-
dently shares the common belief that
service explosives are more powerful than
the commercial types. Mostly they’re
not. The shattering effect of explosives
is gauged by the velocity
with which they detonate.
Gelignite, at between 6000
and 7000 metres a second,
about equals T.N.T, and
guncotton, and ranks well
above ammonal with its
2000. Ammonal, on
account of its low rate of
detonation, has a lifting
rather than a shattering
effect, and is used for
cratering or mined charges.
> “Jelly,” T.N.T. and gun-
cotton will shatter rail-
way-lines, steel girders and
the like with practically no
tamping, the detonation
being so rapid that the
surrounding air builds up a
resistance almost equal to
the object being attacked.
This probably accounts
for the erroneous idea that
“jelly” strikes down and
blasting-powder strikes up.;
Powder, being a low ex-
plosive, simply lifts, fol-
lowing the line of least
resistance, (A low explo-
sive, by the way, doesn’t
detonate; it generates its gases by rapid
combustion.) Towards the end of the
war British chemists evolved higher ex-
plosives than T.N.T., the top being a
plastic “banger” of a detonation-rate
reputedly approaching 12,000 metres.
That seems to be the ultimate in chemical
explosives. After.that, the atom.
* * * ♦
“Old-timer”: “Spinifex Sam” (B.
5/5/’4B) needn’t think the Moonee (s.-w.
Q.) country is snake country just be-
cause he allegedly killed 10 while wait-
ing for the billy to boil. Down in the
Mathoura swamps and along the Wakool
(s.-w. Riverina) there are places where
he wouldn’t get time to boil his billy.
My record is 17, killed on Tapalin be-
tween the time it took Bill to light the
fire and me to get a billy of water. I
went for that water to a corrugated-iron
tank sunk in the ground by old King
Carter’s fruit-dip, and when I lifted the
manhole cover I thought the blanky thing
was full of snakes. We shoved the lid
down tight, rolled in some horse-balls
soaked in carbon disulphide, blocked up
the small inlet pipe through which the
Joes had gone after frogs and retired to
lunch. Two hours later we pitchforked
17 defunct browns, blacks and tigers
from their death-chamber.
“Stock Inspector”: “Chestnuts” is,
without doubt, the correct term for the
horny excrescences on the inside of a
horse’s front legs and on the hind legs
just below the hock-joint. The horse be-
longs to the genus of “whole-hoofed”
mammals, the term signifying that at the
end of its limbs the horse is provided
only with a strongly-developed horny
substance, the hoof, and has only the
middle-toe developed; the toes on either
side, the so-called “splint-bones,” being
only rudimentary, while the other toes
(i.e., the big and little) are merely indi-
cated by the horny growths or chestnuts.
A fancied resemblance to the edible nut
of the European tree is probably its
origin.

“C.E.”: Denny came on Dad Stevens
by the open span at the township end
of his property. “Looking for that new
hand I put on,” Dad greeted. “Well,
you won’t find him standing there”
Denny grinned, “That’s the last place t’
wait.” “Aw, I dunno,” countered Dad.
“This is the fence I’m paying him wages
on.” “I know,” Denny agreed. “And
I’m not saying he won’t turn up some
time, but with this forty-hour week, and
a few more things, y’ll be lucky to strike
him.” Dad glanced dubiously at the
fence. “Heard he spent most of last week
fishing,” he said, “and the fortnight be-
fore he reckoned his rheumatism wus
too bad t’ work. And before that
he took three weeks’ holiday.” “Well,
you won’t see him this week, or next,”
Denny remarked. “The beer’s arrived.”
“But, cripes, me fence is all down, an’
the stock strayin’,” roared Dad, stepping
out of the way of a passing car. “It’s
up t’ that cove t’ hold his flamin’ thirst
till knock-off time!” “Sh-sh.” Denny’s
whisper was urgent. “Y’re running a
risk talking like that nowadays,” he
cautioned, nodding after the car. “If y’r
fencer gets wind that y’re complaining,
he’ll like as not walk out and leave y’
stranded!”
THE MINA.
Blime! he’s a larrikin,
When he crosses the street;
Him with his yellow socks on,
And swanking just a treat.
And as to where he came from,
I’d say, maybe, the ’Loo;
Or Little Lon. or Bourke-street
An’ Surry Hills he knew.
This bird they call the mina!
To see his cocky walk!
Like a spieler at the races,
Some pugilistic hawk;
Swinging his hips and shoulders
Just like a fancy pug:
As much to say, “I’m Mina,
An’ ain’t no flamin’ mug!”
Head up and hell to humans.
He’s flinging down the lane
Or swanking in the gardens,
Hopping across a drain;
He’s swinging of his timbers,
Strutting just where it suits:
That larrikin, the mina,
In his bright yellow boots.

DOGS NEED CARE
To keep your dog healthy and fit you
should watch for danger signs that show
when he is out of sorts and needs atten-
tion. If his coat is dull, loose or ragged
if his nose is warm and he is moody,
listless or off his food, he is probably
suffering from digestive disorders that pro-
duce these symptoms. Start giving him

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT OT GRAZCOS."
Dear Sheep.
“R. Ney”: One of the effects
of high wool and mutton prices',
and a good season following the
1944-46 drought, is that the price
of breeding ewes—of any quality
—has shot to almost unheard-of
levels. Men trying to stock-up
or those just making a start —
notably the very few ex-service-
men who’ve managed to get a
block out of the awful mess of
soldier land settlement are
gloomily watching ewe prices
and wondering whether or not
to buy.
The answer depends on indi-
vidual circumstances. A man
with good grass going to waste
very naturally wants to get sheep
on to it as soon as possible, par-
ticularly since the wool market
is extra-good and looks like
staying so for several years.
What has to be watched is the
quality of the ewes. If big money
is asked for them, then they
ought to come up to a fairly
high standard; if they don’t it
would be better in the long run
to let them go for sausage-meat.
The point is that sheep-country,
whether wool or mutton,
whether heavy-carrying or not,
should carry the best kind of
sheep suitable for it. A thou-
sand good ewes is a far better
proposition than 2000 roughies,
and he who rushes bull-headed
to a sale and grabs
going at any price asked is in-
viting trouble.
There are plenty of unscrupu-
lous owners and dealers waiting
on the anxious fellow who has
land and no sheep. They have
as many tricks as Harte’s
heathen Chinee. And they have
a special bag of tricks for the
new man, who might have plenty
of theoretical knowledge but not
much practical nous. The
wise buyer—and these are days
when the old Latin motto caveat
emptor, which may be trans-
lated as “let the buyer keep his
eyes open,” was never more apt,
in sheep as in other things—
feels his way about, listening a
lot and saying little. And about
the best guide he has is the ex-
ample or advice of the old hand
who has no axe to grind. Allied
with the old hand and as trust-
worthy is the State sheep-and-
wool expert in the particular
district.
Crops at Katherine.
“Agric”: A great enthusiast for
Katherine (N.T.) is the officer in
charge of the C.S.I.R. experi-
ment farm there (W. Arndt), and
some of his assistants must be
equally enthusiastic, for, having
been stationed there with the
Army during the war, they
jumped at the opportunity to
take up civilian residence and
work for the C.S.I.R. Peanuts
have for years been grown suc-
cessfully on the Katherine River,
about eight farms being estab-
lished there before the war. With
native labor to do the picking
and cleaning, a price of £2 per
bag at Perth was satisfactory,
and during the war the farmers
grew vegetables for the services.
Although only about 5000
acres in the area are easily irri-
gable from the one permanent
stream —the Katherine —a sur-
vey has disclosed about 100,000
acres of arable medium- to fair-
fertility land with an annual
rainfall of about 40 inches, most
of which falls between Novem-
ber and March. Sfylosanthes
glacilis (known as “perennial
Townsville lucerne”) has given
good results in small trial plots,
and this year three acres have
been planted to provide seed for
large-scale trials; tobacco is
being extensively tried, and one
crop has shown promising re-
sults ; grain sorghum, cotton,
cowpeas, broom millet and soy-
bean are other crops being
grown, and most of them are
doing well. In the C.S.I.R.
plant-introduction section of the
farm trials are being undertaken
with castor-oil, guar (a legume
used in sizing paper) and an
assortment of other legumes and
grasses, including sesame, a
high-class fibre for mixing with
cotton and silk. (The ancient
Egyptians used this for wrap-
ping up mummies.)
Bovril Estates, Ltd., is about
to begin work on the erection
of meatworks at Katherine, and
these are expected to give a
great fillip to the pastoral in-
dustry in the district. At pre-
sent it does not pay to market a
lot of the nondescript cattle run-
ning on the unfenced properties,
and local meatworks will en-
able property-owners to have a
good clean-up for a start in im-
proving their herds. Arndt en-
visages a prosperous future for
the Katherine, with stylo and
improved pastures providing
good grazing for stores pur-
chased outside the district and
topped off with locally-grown
grain sorghum and meatworks
by-products.
Moving Wheat in W.A.
“Bill Ding”: A huge portion
of the W.A. wheat harvest is
being transferred to ports by
motor-vehicle. Great numbers
of these are traversing hundreds
of miles of road per week with
their three to four tons of wheat,
day and night, and, incidentally,
providing heaps of maintenance
work and labor at high wages.
The W.A.G.R. acknowledges
itself unable to undertake the
whole job of getting the wheat
away because of the serious
deterioration of its rolling-stock.
The parrots of the wheat region
are enjoying this traffic innova-
tion. So much wheat is being
spilled on the roads that swarms
of them are met on every
journey.
A Diploma Day.
“Ben C.”: It was held at
Hawkesbury Agricultural Col-
lege, Richmond (N.S.W.), and
there assembled about 300 proud
parents, departmental heads,
politicians and friends. The col-
lege is finding it hard to accom-
modate its increasing students,
the dining-hall has had to be
enlarged, a new cannery and
packing-house awaits equip-
ment, there is' a new machinery-
shed, plans are out for a new
dairy factory and more students’
quarters.
Hawkesbury does more than
train agricultural students. It
also trains ex-servicemen for the
land or allied industries, and
holds field-days and conferences
and schools for adult farmers
and teachers and technicians.
Under the perennial principal,
E. A. Southee (its head for 27
years), it has put through no
fewer than 11,511 students of all
kinds. The beauty of this kind
of training for a farm career is
that the student, if he chooses,
may leave the college so
equipped as to be almost self-
sufficient when he goes to his
own farm. Dux of the agricul-
ture course this year was N.
Payne, an Alstonville (N.S.W.)
man, and dux in dairying was
M. A. Liebelt, from Mt.
Gambier (S.A.).
A Self-greaser.
“Old Sweat”; A major pest of
the poultry-yard is the stickfast
flea —body the size of a turnip-
seed, long beak which it drives
into the fowl’s head. It sticks
for weeks, gorging with blood,
hundreds clinging to a single
bird’s head. The only remedy is
grease, which, by clogging the
breathing spores in the crea-
ture’s rump, suffocates it. But
catching and greasing only 100
birds is a terrific job.
Make a wheat-hopper 3ft.
long, 6in. over all other dimen-
sions. Along front at bottom
tack a 2in. board to form front
of hopper. Along edge of roof
tack a strip of sheep- or rabbit-
skin, blanket, bag—anything that
will carry oil. Bring this down
so that an opening of about 2in.
remains all along, through which
the fowls will pick at the wheat.
Saturate the curtain with oil or
semi-liquid grease so that as the
fowl shoves its head in it makes
contact and so greases its own
head. With the birds hungry
this device will grease a yard of
100 within an hour and can
then be moved to the next
section.
Show Bulls.
“Waver”: Some of your corre-
spondents, particularly those
writing on the Sydney Show,
seem to be sadly amiss. To say
that a dairy bull is a worthy ani-
mal simply because it wins a
blue ribbon in a prize-ring is
generally far from correct. The
only value a dairy bull possesses
is his ability to breed high-pro-
ducing daughters' and sons cap-
able of transmitting similar
qualities. If he does not breed
daughters who will raise the
average milk and butter-fat pro-
duction of the herd he has no
place there at all.
Though the show-ring ad-
mittedly has its place in keeping
the breeds before the public
“I think I'll have my breakfast in bed this morning ,
Meadows!”
and provides a place where
farmers may gather in discus-
sion tQ their mutua i benefit, we
must remember that it is of no
economic importance to the
dairy industry. The sooner the
industry becomes more fully
awakened to the need for a
realistic approach to this matter
and acknowledges the fact that
it is “what goes into the pail
that counts,” then the sooner
dairying will stop being the
“Cinderella” of the land in-
dustries,
a Tractor Level
tt< ~ . „ _ f , * ,
Gmra ; Its tor those who
use tractor a variet Y 0i
belt-power jobs. Get a spirit-
level of the type that is hung on
a string line, usually made of
aluminium and inexpensive. The
hooked ends which normally
hang on the string are bent flat
or parallel with the level and a
small hole bored in each for a
bolt and nut to attach it to the
tractor. Now, with a straight-
edge and ordinary level, find
the true level of the tractor
straight-edge from rear wheel to
rear wheel and mount the
small spirit-level wherever con-
venient on tractor —across the
dash-board is a good spot.
If you set the small level to
show dead-level, packing either
end if necessary and tighten up
tight, when you wish to line up
the tractor to drive machinery
(which should also be level) you
simply jack the tractor on each
side until it is level. The belt
will run true without having to
drive sticks in the ground to
keep it on, a practice which soon
spoils any belt. It is equally
important to have a tractor
standing level when running long
hours on an irrigation-pump or
suchlike, as the lubrication
arrangements are often upset by
being unreasonably out of level.
Three-purpose Hedges,
“Pat O’Day”: On the N.S.W.
south-western slopes, where
rigors of winter have to be con-
tended with in garden culture
and strong westerly winds help
to smash down unestablished
hedge-plants, Cupressus torulosa
(planted 3ft. apart) makes a
splendid shelter-hedge or break-
wind, and it require? little atten-
tion as regards trimming. This
hedge does not cause litter, such
as from seed-pods, after heavy
winds. Classed as a tree also,
it may be used in qvenues.
A large garden may be corn-
pletely enclosed with a hedge-
fence of evergreen African box-
thorn {Lycium horridum ) planted
a oot a P art - Cupressus lam-
bertiana and C. horizontal,
though rather expensive to plant
thickly for shelter purposes, will
soon repay with their quick-
growing habit and beautiful
effect and provide shade and
shelter in summer and winter to
delicate garden plants,
Golden privet, planted a foot
apart, is another dual-purpose
shrub, though it is a lower
grower than Cupressus.

USER WRITES:
“I have now had my
Elastrator for 2 years and
during that time have
docked approximately
5000 wether lambs. In
my opinion it is defi-
nitely superior to any
previous method I have
used. I would also like
to state that onee the
user becomes proficient
with this instrument, it
is also quicker than any
other method I know of,
I can thoroughly recom-
mend the Elastrator.”

The last is a pretty specimen

A useful hedge is Viburnum

Petrol Economisers.
“Radian”: The high-pressure
salesman who will fit a petrol-
economiser to your motor,
guarantees you more miles per
gallon and wishes you joy in
motoring, all for a couple of
quid, is among us again. Re-
cently one of them called on
our plant and promptly went
away again—we had met both
salesmen and gadget before.
The modern carburettor is a
scientific piece of equipment,
designed and built by men who
know the job, and it does not re-
quire extras for efficient opera-
tion. If your motor is not
economical consult a mechanic
who knows carburettors before
doing anything else —it will be
much cheaper in the long run.
Any invention that would really
save large amounts of petrol
would be worth as much as the
car itself.
Hints for the Farm.
“Urana”: One of the best
feeds for poultry is carrots. In
good land they are easily grown
arid can be sown almost any time
of the year. If the ground is
wanted in the meantime for
other crops, they can be dug and
stored in damp sand until
needed. When green feed is
scarce, carrots help make up the
deficiency and are excellent for
providing yolk color in the eggs.
They may be fed whole hung in
“baskets” made from old pieces
of wire-netting, or can be
crushed or minced for chickens
and young birds.
“Big Billy”: Because lucerne
is a crop which extracts on an
average 1501 b. to 2001 b. per
acre of lime from the soil per
year, it is often necessary to add
lime to soils growing lucerne in
any but those semi-alkaline soils
prevalent in semi-arid condi-
tions. Advantage of applying
lime to established stands is not
only that it replaces used lime
and helps decomposition of
organic matter, but the action
of the lime on the mechanical
condition of the soil makes for
better aeration and water dis-
tribution by loosening it, and
lime tends to liberate more
mineral plant foods.
“Bill C.”: If it looks like rain,
but you think the fall will be
very light, give your vegetable-
beds the best drenching avail-
able water supplies will allow.
Even a light drizzle is beneficial
on already damp ground,
whereas on dry ground it
would merely moisten the sur-
face and be of no value.
“W. Court”: Some people
will use dangerous kerosene to
light the stove, no matter how
much small wood is provided.
Dried fruit-skins, waxed paper
and cardboard from battery-
cases, greasy rags’ stripped corn-
cobs or wood-chips soaked in
sump-oil are much safer. I
know a woman who was badly
burned through throwing kero-
sene on a smouldering fire. The
fire did not burn up at once, but
merely smoked at first, only to
blaze up suddenly in her face
as she prepared to light it with a
match.
“Ned”: When small black
ants invade bee hives, usually
in dry weather, and nest on top
of the frames —they don’t attack
the bees, but their presence irri-
tates and excites them—brush
the ants off the frames and stand
the legs of the hives in small
cans of sump-oil. The ants
won’t come back.
“Herbert”: Keep the guards
on mowing-machine and binder
clean and the knives will last
longer. A piece of hoop-iron
about 20in. long makes a good
cleaner. Mark off 4in. in the
centre of the hoop-iron and file
four or five sharp teeth. Then
bend the iron up at right angles
on both sides of the teeth and
again at right-angles to form
hand-grips. Use the toothed
section to clean the nose of the
guards and the ends to scrape
the plates.
“Nedher”: When putting up
fibro or three-ply sheets heat the
nails before driving. Heating
eliminates risk of cracking the
sheets. Dip nails in oil before
driving in the end sections of
sawn boards; it stops splitting.
“C.P,”: Being interested in
the Texas (U.S.A.) beef-cattle
industry and anxious for some
sort of a map as a reference, I
asked the Texas Land Office if
it could supply one. The re-
quest was referred to the U.S.
Department of the Interior, and
the Geological Survey (H. N.
Luber, Acting Chief of Distri-
bution) promptly sent a four-
sheet topographical map of the
State large enough to cover the
•wall of a room and with all
necessary features defined. Sold
at $1.50 a copy, and cheap at
twice the price.

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
{Transferred from Service
Department.)
How to get rid of borers in fruit-
trees ?
After clearing away the sawdust-
like excreta, probe the holes with
flexible wire to try to kill the grubs,
then spray or pour into the holes
plenty of wood-preserving oil. Finally
seal with beeswax. Where the holes
are bard to get at, drive a big-headed
nail into the hole and imprison the
borer. Generally one treatment is
all that is necessary.

Best way to store pumpkins ?
Allow the vegetables to ripen on
the vines, preferably until the plants
die off. In damp areas a piece of
board or tin placed under the pump-
kins will protect them from snails
and slugs. After cutting the pumpkins
leave them in the sun for a few weeks
to dry out thoroughly, then store in
a shed on slats or straw. Be careful
not to break off the stalks when
gathering; this is one of the causes
of early decay.


Real Reason
The Referendum
The object of the forthcoming prices
referendum is to give the Canberra
Government more power.
The ultimate aim is complete power by
socialisation, which is Labour’s declared
objective.
Socialisation is also the objective of
the Communist Party. And so the
Labour Party and the Communist Party
are fellow travellers on the same road.
That road leads inevitably to dictator-
ship, as all recent history proves.
That is why the Communists are, once
again, Labour’s strongest supporters.

More “Rationalising.”
On the desk of the Chairman
of the Dogbiscuit Board was a
pile of voluminous reports;
gathered in front of it were some
of his senior officers: the
Deputy-Assistant Chairman, the
Chief Clerk, the Assistant Sur-
vey Organiser, the Chief Inspec-
tor, the Chief Analyst and the
Deputy-Chief Taster. The chair-
man was addressing the staff
conference.
“The tabulated results of the
State-wide survey which our
specially-augmented field staff
has completed after eighteen
months,” he said, “disclose, I
observe, that cocker spaniels eat
on the average point nought nine
eight of a pound per dog-hour,
as compared with a dachshund’s
point nought seven six.” He
looked grave. “Do you realise,
gentlemen, the deep significance
of this? It is liable, unless recti-
fied, to throw the whole
economy of the board out of
gear!
“All our consumption esti-
mates, unfortunately, have been
based on the fallacious assump-
tion that all dogs in the eight-
to-thirty-pound class would con-
sume similar quantities. Obvi-
ously the quoted discrepancy is
due, however, not to the dogs’
weight, but to their lengths. A
biscuit takes longer to reach the
digestive organs of a dachshund
because of the inordinate length
of its stomach. Now let me see
—we could get over it by order-
. , . ,
ing the manufacturers to make
a larger biscuit specially for
dachshunds. The alternative, of
standardising the length of all
dogs, seems, however, the simpler
solution. I see no reason why
the Minister should not be ap-
proached with a view to intro-
ducing legislation making this
compulsory.
“Regarding the shape of the
biscuits,” he went on, “manu-
f ac turers in the past have clung
to the inexplicable habit of turn-
j n g out for dogs biscuits of a
shape which they—the manu-
f actU rers—thought best for them,
We propose to alter all that by

cent, are middle-aged or elderly
and have few, if any, front
teeth, and that these have diffi-
culty in picking up square,
oblong or round biscuits. After
deep consideration and experi-
ment, we have decided to intro-
duce a special triangular biscuit
which can be more easily picked
up by all dogs. The making of
these new biscuits will necessarily
entail the installation of new
machinery by the manufacturers,
No doubt a Bottleneck in sup-
plies will result from the un-
avoidable delay which will occur
while they endeavor to get per-
mission for this from the Trea-
sury. Import Procurement, Ex-
change Control, etc. That
aspect, however, is really no con-
cern of the board’s. Besides,
what’s wrong with a good bottle-
' neck? I venture to say that
no self-respecting chairman of
any Government board,” he
added, not without a touch of
justifiable pride, “would be
happy without one!”
“But what about the big
stockpile of old-style biscuits
we accumulated when we com-
pulsorily acquired all stocks in
the State?” put in the Chief
Inspector. “When the new-style
biscuits come in the old ones
will deteriorate, and we may
have to dump them.”
The chairman looked at his
subordinate pityingly. “Mr.
Woggle! ” he said severely. “Do
you imagine that this board pro-
poses to establish a dangerous
. . .
precedent by eliminating waste?
I sometimes think,” he added,
“that you still retain some of
the quaint notions you appa-
rently absorbed in the days when
you worked for profit-hungry
private enterprise!
“Besides, gentlemen,” he went
on, his glance embracing all his
senior officers, “the dumping of
old stocks before new ones come
in to replace them is m the best
traditions of Government boards
-it makes the commodity both
scarce and dear, and after all.
isn’t that what we are here for?
“The position then, as I see
it, gentlemen, is this: We shall
order the Minister to prepare
legislation to have the lengths
of all dogs standardised so as to
facilitate our estimates ; we shall
order manufacturers to intro-
duce the triangular biscuit, with
heavy fines for those who refuse
to do so. Our. next concern will
be the color of dog-biscuits. We
shall start an immediate State-
wide survey to determine if dogs
have any particular predilection,
if they prefer them slightly burnt,
etc. We shall need an additional
hundred and fifty men for that.”
“But labor is practically unob-
tainable,” protested the Chief
Inspector. “Even factories can’t
get men! Where are we to get
them from?”
The chairman bent on the
philistine a withering' glance.
“Are you altogether an idiot,
Mr. Woggle?” he asked. “Surely
you are aware that militant
union officials are constantly
being deposed by ballot, that
not all defeated ‘Labor’ mem-
bers have yet been allotted good
jobs, and that Ministers still
have friends in their elector-
ates ! ”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

White Australia
In attacking the White Australia policy
the Communist party has said “a quota
system would abolish the racial discrimin-
ation implied by the White Australia
policy This policy is another version
of the racial theories with which Hitler
corrupted the German % youth... .If the
quota system were introduced, all possi-
bility of an uncontrolled flood of immi-
grants from either Asia or Europe would
be averted.”
Some of the churches fell for the same
line and denounced the “White Australia”
policy, no doubt to the intense satisfac-
tion of the “Comrades.”
If quotas were based on population
we should have a couple of hundred
Chinese or Indians to one Dane or to
one Irishman, If the quotas were not
proportionate there would be a, squeal
that they were “discriminatory” or “illu-
sory.” Now the door is shut. If it were
open ever so little, people who now accept
the fact of absolute exclusion would
clamor for entry. And the claims to pre-
ferential treatment of a motley lot of
“anti-fascists” of dubious lineage would
be strongly pressed by the Commos.
Apart from social difficulties arising
from miscegenation and the economic
problems arising from different living
standards, many Asiatic peoples cannot
be culturally assimilated in a new environ-
ment.
In Siam, for example, although the
Thai originally came from China; the two-
million-odd Chinese tend to regard them-
selves as being more closely bound to
China than to Siam. Out of this arose
large-scale rioting in Bangkok and else-
where after the formal end of World
War 11. In Burma the Indian was, and
still is, a problem. In Japan many
Koreans had virtually the status of helots.
There are tensions between the Chinese
and Malays. Not long ago a large
number of Chinese met cruel deaths at
the hands of “our Indernesian comrades.”
The recent blood-baths in India and the
murders in Palestine are evidence of the
horrible results of clashes of race, reli-
gion and culture.
In Australia there is nothing of that
violence between creeds. We have
troubles of our own making, no doubt,
but let us not import other troubles from
Asia or elsewhere, even on the quota
system.
There is, of course, no escaping the
fact that we must have migrants. They
should be such as are capable of being
assimilated with the better elements of
the population and of conforming with
what is best in the Australian way of life.
But Heaven preserve this land from be-
coming a “Red” Australia of polyglot
races, heterogeneous cultures, warring
creeds and ineradicable antipathies.—
Miles Gregarius (Q.),
Compulsory Unionism
It is time that the cant about non-
unionists being willing to accept the bene-
fits unions have won, but unwilling to
support the unions, was exposed. In
the first place, the unions were not the
sole agents in improving working con-
ditions. Among several others was the
Arbitration Court, but the leaders of
“Labor” are rarely heard urging striking
unionists to give loyal support to the
Court from which they are willing to
accept benefits.
These leaders do, however, assert that
the Arbitration Court is failing to serve
the workers and, therefore, no longer de-
serves their support. The same charge
could be brought against the trade-unions,
for any small or large benefits gained
these days by the unions are more than
offset by the things of value of which they
deprive workers. Not the least of these
things is personal liberty. It is as tyranni-
cal to compel men to join organisations
of sectional interests as it is to prevent
them forming themselves into such organi-
sations.
Every organisation comes, at last, to
serve established leaders instead of the
purpose for which it was originally
formed. If they deserve loyalty because
of past worthy achievement, then the
feudal system should be supported because
of the good purpose it once served, and
absolute monarchies which once imposed
law and order upon chaos should never
have been overthrown. The trade-unions
of today are developing some of the
most objectionable features of feudal sys-
terns and absolute monarchies. Non-
unionists should be looking for a Simon
de Montfort or a John Hampden to lead
them.—D. W. (N.S.W.).
“Secret Radios”
One Sunday night in Melbourne re-
cently people listening to one of the
commercial radio stations had their pro-
gramme suddenly jammed by a secret
radio station calling itself DIG and
broadcasting a political address to ex-
servicemen.
Next day there was an outcry from
the P.M.G.’s Department and the P.M.G.
himself.' They spoke of the steps taken
to arrest the “radio pirate” and stressed
the £5OO fine or five-years’ maximum
imprisonment. There the matter stands
and there it is likely to stand unless
the Government takes action with the
sale of disposals transmitting equipment.
I heard the broadcast and have no
doubt that it originated from one of
those old Army transmitters (portable)
which can be bought from many disposals
and junk stores in Melbourne for prices
from £5 to £l2. Any person can buy one,
and the gear is so simple that no tech-
nical knowledge is needed to operate it.
The owner can have it “on the air” in
less than five minutes.
The Government should insist that the
equipment be sold only to those who have
“Those Weather people! I knew it wouldn't keep fine."
amateur transmitting licences, or to those
who can prove that the equipment is to
be used for legitimate commercial radio.
A record should then be kept of all
owners of this equipment.
Schoolboys whose fathers have a few
bob are buying transmitters and talking
to each other on wavelengths allotted to
commercial radio stations. Thousands
of transmitters have left the Disposals
Commission within the last two years, and
only a few of them are in licensed hands.
For more than two years the Wireless
Institute of Australia —governing body
of amateur radio in this country—has
urged the Government to take this sug-
gested action, but with no effect.—
Waddlin’ Willie (Vic.).
“Angels” or Niggers?
A few years ago this country rang with
praise of the New Guinea natives’ devo-
tion to the Australian Army, then des-
perately trying to halt the Jap advance
in the islands.
Last month 29 N.G. boys and four
native women were killed in an aircraft
crash at Lae, and a Brisbane paper
printed these comments;
An official of the department (Civil
Aviation) said today that 33 passengers was
“a lot for the plane to carry.” But “they
pile niggers in up there,” he added.
And;
An Australian who knows conditions in
civil aviation in N.G. from personal ex-
perience said: “Before the war we used
not to count natives as passengers, but as
freight. They used to be weighed and
charged for on a poundage basis. As far
as I know, the same state of affairs still
applies.”
They were “Fuzzy-Wuzzy Angels” a
few years ago when they were carrying
wounded Australians on their backs to
the dressing-stations; now they are
“niggers” charged for at so much the
pound.
I expected a protest from an official
source, or from a returned soldiers’
organisation, or at least some mother
whose son is alive today because a
“nigger” carried him out of Buna on his
back. But nothing has been forthcom-
ing. Whether you are black or white,
this is a thankless country to fight for.
—Bickerstaff (Q.).
Production and Prices
“Jindivick” (B. 21/4/’4B) addressed his
question—“ When will the Government
realise that the only factor which will
control or reduce prices in this country is
supply?”— to the wrong quarter. He
should have put it to the people of Aus-
tralia, because the Government, present
style, neither leads nor commands —it
merely floats on the surface of what it
thinks is public opinion. Like all hollow
objects, it floats quite nicely.
There is some evidence that one or two
of its members, including Mr. Chifley,
have seen the country’s need for greater
production, but their pronouncements
have been very timid.
Too many Australians, thrown off
balance by war and its economic after-
math, and by the sudden transfer of
absolute power from Capital to Labor,
have been picturing a fools’ paradise in
which less and less work for more and
more pay add up to prosperity and con-
tentment.
But we are not all fools, and there are
encouraging signs that we, including some
union leaders, are beginning to realise
that neither leisure nor money has any
intrinsic value, and that their worth rests
only in what use we can make of them.
It is dawning on us that we can have
only what we produce ; that the less work
we do in return for a wage, the less that
wage will buy for us, however imposing
it may look in terms of £ s. d. There
will be no more, or cheaper, houses, tele-
phones, envelopes, steel, electricity,
motor-cars or cigarettes until we make
more for our own use.
When we wake up thoroughly to these
facts, we shall get down to work and have
less time to snarl at each other, having
first chucked all the Commos and half
the bureaucrats out on their necks. But
the initiative will come from the people,
never from the Government, present style.
—Hist (N.S.W.).
Poisoned Birds
The wholesale poisoning of grass-
hoppers with arsenical poisoned bran
must be stopped. Officially, poisoned
grasshoppers do not kill birds, and the
Australian Museum Ornithologist, J. R.
Kinghorn, supports that notion. He said,
among other things, “Experimenters find
that birds prefer to pick only the legs off
dead grasshoppers and leave the body.”
Can anyone imagine a flock of ibis pick-
ing the legs off grasshoppers and leaving
the body?
Neville Cayley says the ibis is the most
useful Australian bird, and L. Ethridge,
of Mount Lindsay station, Barraba, has
seen them eat poisoned ’hoppers and die.
The following N. S. Wales men on the
land saw blue martins dying in hundreds
in the 1934-35 poisoning; Roy Crowley,
Cobbadah; E. L. Spencer, Mulwaree,
Barraba ; and Frank Witten, Te Ware,
Barraba. Witten found many dead blue
martins in a hollow tree, and Charles
Kelly, of Piallomore, via Tamworth, had
the same experience. George Maunder,
of Silverside, Gidley, found many dead
starlings in a tree he cut down for fire-
wood. Apparently these birds, when
poisoned, seek some secluded place to
die.
Lately starlings have practically dis-
appeared from Tamworth (N.S.W.).
Herbert Maunder, a well-boring con-
tractor, reported many dead birds on the
road between Gunnedah and Baradine. A
motorist travelling from Port Macquarie
to Tamworth also saw many dead birds
on the road as well as possums poisoned
by the bran bait. A taxi-driver reported
many dead starlings on the roads near
Tamworth, and a woman in West Tam-
worth saw .starlings die in her garden
when neighbors used poisoned bait to
kill grasshoppers.
The only authentic report of ibis being
poisoned comes from Mr. Ethridge, but
diminishing flocks in this district suggest
that a great number have been destroyed.
Although the ibis is probably the best
bird friend the pastoralist has, the blue
martin is also an efficient
killer. Flocks of these birds used to visit
us in the late spring and rear their young
in our gardens, but not one has been seen
for the last two years. Although the
starling isn’t popular about our homes,
he is a very useful fellow in helping con-
trol the sheep-fly pest.
Pastoralists know only too well the
value of our birds', and it is up to them
to see that the Government stops this
indiscriminate slaughter. R. H. D.
(N.S.W.).
Root of the Matter
Another of those museums of
“Labor’s” war effort, the wheat distillery
at Wallaroo (S.A.), which, like the ones at
Warracknabeal (Vic.) and Cowra (N.S.W.),
never processed a bushel, was mentioned
to Dedman by Wallaroo’s Mayor, who
asked that the thing be made available for
some use or other. It cost nearly
£500,000, and Wallaroo fears the plant
will be dismantled and sold off as junk.
Dedman pleaded that it would be almost
impossible to use it for any other purpose
than the one for which it was never used
and never will be What with Scully’s
wheat distilleries and wool-floors, there’s
enough stuff lying about to serve for
hundreds of houses.—Onka (S.A.).
Despite all the penal taxation and regu-
lations inflicted upon it by State Gov-
ernments anxious to preserve a herd of
railway employees in jobs, road transport
progresses. OuT'Xongreach (C.Q.) way
WeUshot station lease expired and 25,000
sheep had to be shifted to properties up
to 600 miles away. Seven motor-trailers
did the job, travelling !5 hours a day,
with relief drivers. —Occident (Q.).
The Queensland Printing Industry
Union. went too f far in deciding that
“all members must sign declarations that
they are not identified with any political
party opposed to the State or Federal
Labor platform.” To get a job a man
must join a union—ex-servicemen found
that out —and this union’s edict virtually
forbids the granting of jobs to Liberals,
C.P. men. Single-taxers and Douglas
Creditors as well as Commuiusts, unless
they sign false declarations. Exclusion of
Communists from union office, on the
ground that “Communists subscribe to
the gaining of industrial ends by violent
and illegal methods, the result of which
would be the destruction of the union,”
is established industrial law in Westralia,
and that, plus the secret ballot, is all that
should be aimed at by anti-Communist
unions.— Nedlands (W.A.).
There was a postscript on N.S.W.
“Labor’s” celebration of 100 years of
“public education” in Professor J. Mac-
donald Holmes’s The Murray Valley (B.
12/5/’48):
The growth of material advantage and
two world wars have delayed the attention
that social changes merit and have obscured
their aims. In Australia, as in England,
a go-as-you-please system in post-school
educational thought succeeded the old belief
in the apprenticeship system .and left chaos
in present adult education which has not
yet been made good by technical, agri-
cultural or other education.
The prof, could have added that out of
that chaos emerged the obsession with
gambling and easy money.—S. H. C.
(Vic.).
The real reason for the Communist
set against Hanlon came out in a Com-
munist sheet; —
Queenslanders believe Hanlon aimed at
breaking A.R.U. in Queensland and forcing
railmen into pliable A.W.U His object
was believed to be to attract overseas in-
dustrial capital.
As for (1) mounting resignations suggest
that the A.R.U. broke itself when it let
Communists take it over. As for (2), all
sensible Queenslanders applaud Hanlon
for doing that very thing.— Brekker
Creek (Q.).
With employers constantly complain-
ing about labor shortages, it is surprising
that more use is not made (especially
in the cities) of many superannuated men
who, at 60 or over, are still physically
fit and mentally active. Here are valuable
experience and ability going to waste.
The employment of such men would not
prejudice the chances of the younger
generation ; rather would it enhance them.
The old chaps would fill many “dead-
end” jobs which would not appeal to
ambitious youths.—K. L. M. (N.S.W.).

One of the ambitions of every housewife is to reign
over a modern all-steel kitchen. It is so nice to come
home to something to be proud of and, most
importantly, to work in.
Nothing contributes more to gracious living than
today’s ideal kitchen. Here is a domain where steel’s
strength, versatility and pleasing appearance is at once
apparent. In the hands of industry steel has brought
to reality the plans of architects and engineers for
greater kitchen effectiveness and beauty.
Yes, today’s dream kitchens with their stainless steel
sinks, electric and gas cooking ranges, trouble-free
hot water services, steel-built freezers and refrigerators,
and space-saving steel storage cabinets are a far cry
from the days of the hand-turned cooking spit and the
iron pot on the hob.
The use of steel in kitchen furnishings and equipment
provides evidence of the fact that steel can do more
jobs better than any other material.
B.H.P. steel—product of the fusion in the furnaces
at the Newcastle Steel Works of South Australian iron
ore and limestone and New South Wales coal —plays its
part in enabling the Australian housewife to enjoy the
benefits of modern kitchen design.
