War Poems
ENGLAND TO THE SEA.
Hearken, O Mother, hearken to thy
daughter!
Fain would I tell thee what men tell to me,
Saying that henceforth no more on any
water
Shall I he first or great or loved or free.
But that these others —so the tale is
spoken —
Who have not known thee all these centuries
By fire and sword shall yet turn England
broken
Back from thy breast and beaten from thy
seas,
Me —whom thou barest where thy waves
should guard me,
Me- —whom thou suckled’st on thy milk of
foam,
Me —whom thy kisses shaped what while
they marred me, N
To whom thy storms are sweet and ring of
home.
“Behold," they cry, “she is grown soft and
strengthless,
All her proud memories changed to fear and
fret."
Say, thou, who hast watched through ages
that are lengthless,
Whom have I feared, and when did I forgetf
What sons of mine have shunned thy whorls
and races?
Have I not reared for thee time and again
And bid to go forth to share thy fierce
embraces
Sea-ducks, sea-wolves, sea-rovers, and sea-
men?
Names that thou knowest—great hearts that
thou boldest,
Bockiny them, rocking them in an endless
wake —
Captains the world can match not with its
boldest,
Hawke, Howard, Grenville, Frobisher,
Drake?
Nelson —the greatest of them all —the master
Who swept across thee like a shooting star,
And, while the Earth stood veiled before dis-
aster,
Caught Death and slew him — there —at
Trafalgarf
Mother, they knew me then as thou didst
know me •
Then I cried, Peace, and every flag was
furled:
But I am old, it seems, and they would show
me
That never more my peace shall bind the
world.
Wherefore, 0 Sea, I, standing thus before
thee,
Stretch forth my hands unto thy surge and
say:
“When they come forth who seek this empire
o'er thee,
And I go forth to meet them —on that day—
“ God grant to us the old Armada weather,
The winds that rip, the heavens that stoop
and lour —
Not till the Sea and England sink together
Shall they be masters! Let them boast that
hour!”
R. E. VERNEDE.
THE WIFE OF FLANDERS.
Low and brown barns, thatched and
repatclied and tattered,
Where I had seven sons until to-day —
A little hill of hay your spur has scattered..
This is not Paris. You have lost the way.
You, staring at your sword to find it brittle,
Surprised at the surprise that was your
plan,
Who, shaking and breaking barriers not a
little,
Find never more the death-door of Sedan.
Must I for more than carnage call you claim-
ant,
Paying you a penny for each son you slay?
Man, the whole globe in gold were not repay-
ment
For what you have lost. And how shall I
repayt
What is the price of that red spark that
caught me
From a kind farm that never had a name?
What is the price of that dead man they
brought me?
For other dead men do not look the same.
How should I pay for one poor, graven
steeple
Whereon you shattered what you shall not
know?
How should I pay you, miserable people,
How should I pay you everything you owe?
Unhappy, can I give you back your honor?
Though I forgave, would any man forget?
While all the great green land has trampled
on her
The treason and terror of the night we met.
Not any more in vengeance or in pardon,
One old wife bargains for a bean that's hers.
You have no word to break: no heart to
harden.
Ride on and prosper. You have lost your
spurs.
G. K. CHESTERTON.
The bugle blast of war brought all the
English poets out of their hiding places.
Even the Poet Laureate woke up, with this:
The monarch Ambition
Hath harnessed his slaves;
But the folk of the Ocean
Are free as the waves....
And William Watson informed his breath-
lessly listening countrymen:—
Even I that am poor am performing my part;
I am giving my brain, I am giving my heart.
Brain and heart that’s easy, but W.W.
doesn’t give his art. Certainly he has a
sonnet, sonorous but empty. Newbolt
proffers poor words: —
So shalt thou when the morning comes
Eise to conquer or to fall,
Joyful hear the rolling drums,
Joyful hear the trumpet’s call.
Then let memory tell thy heart;
“England 1 what thou wert, thou art 1”
Gird thee with thine ancient might,
Forth! and God defend the Eight!
Maurice Hewlett produces four stanzas, of
which the last only is passable:—
Strike, England, quickly, make an end
Of him who seeks a deal with thee.
If he would bargain for thy friend,
What would he trade for Liberty?
Laurence Binyon has merely rimes for his
war-offering;—
We fight the fraud that feeds desire on
Lies, in a lust to enslave and kill,
The barren creed of blood and iron,
Vampire of Europe’s wasted will.
Three sonnets from Alfred Noyes, with
but one sestette worth memory:—
We fought for peace, and we have seen the law
Cancelled, not once, nor twice, by felon hands,
But shattered, again, again, and yet again.
We fought for peace. Now, in God’s name, we draw
The sword, not with a riot of flags and bands,
But silence, and a mustering of men.
James Bernard Fagan gives us rousing
sea-verse, Harold Begbie some journalese,
John Drinkwater some cold words, and Owen
Seaman some scholarly advice.
At last Kipling butts in. The Times
paid, in his name, to the Belgian fund, the
£5O it evidently thought the poem was worth.
“For All We Have and Are” is the sort of
stuff that any intelligent schoolboy could
write; —
For all we have and are,
For all our children’s fate,
Stand up and meet the war.
The Hun is at the gate I
Our world has passed away
In wantonness o’erthrown.
There is nothing left to-day
But steel and fire and stone.
Judgedfeby the test of war, the poets of
England have failed. Only the till-now-
unknown It. E. Vernhde emerges equal to the
splendid opportunity. Chesterton is the next
best: his verses are printed here to show how
far a fall there is between R. E. Vernbde
and the best that the official poets of England
could produce. Vernfede, so far, is the only
compensation literature has got from the
war and perhaps, after all, the war is
worth while.
This collection of Poem s of the Great War
is published, at Is. by Chatto and Windus,
for the National -Relief Fund. Kipling’s
schoolboy heroics appeared too late for in-
clusion.
The object of the Repertory movement
was to bring back art, or if that were im-
possible, at least honesty into the modern
theatre. Australia was in an extraordinary
position. It is doubtful whether its greatest
impresario, the late J. C. Williamson, with
many theatres and hundreds of companies,
had produced in half a century three on
four plays that were worth hearing; an in-
comparable record. When London grew
tired of the drawing-room trivialities of
Pinero and Jones, / and demanded stronger
meat, Melbourne and Sydney still regarded
“The Second Mrs. Tanqueray” as a master-
piece, that foolish little play about a tall,
dark lady who takes poison because she is
not admitted into London society Au-
stralia looked to London for its “intellec-
tual drama,” and London had nothing to
offer, in those days, except plays about un-
interesting people in Park Lane. (Accord-
ing to the Pinero aesthetic no other people
were worthy of dramatic treatment.)
The Repertory Theatre in. Melbourne
resolved to adopt a bolder policy, and we
have plays by Ibsen, Tchekhof, Hauptmann,
Shaw, Galsworthy, Barker and many other
considerable writers. Even dull people felt
that after all Shaw was more amusing than
Haddon Chambers, and Tchekhof was much
more interesting than Pinero. But in other
countries the Repertory theatres wanted
something besides good plays, they wanted
also national plays. In England Shaw and
others demanded first of all English drama.
Here again, in Australia, we seemed a gene-
ration behind. The most enthusiastic of
Repertory theatre supporters certainly did
not want Australian plays. They were far
too intellectual for that. Yet, without the
Australian play there can be no genuine
Repertory movement. English life is not
our life. Character, landscape, atmosphere,
idea —everything is different. So in conces-
sion to a certain clamor McMahon decided
to risk a few' performances. English plays
(even those of third-rate writers like
McEvoy and Arnold Bennett) to be played
in a theatre, local plays, first to be apolo-
gised for and then consigned to an outlying
hall or secret cellar. This was regarded as
a very fair arrangement, and the Repertory
theatre audience was not even ashamed of
its own provincialism and sterility.
Now here was Adams’s chance to dtf some-
thing to save the situation. Most of the
Australian plays produced were not Aus-
tralian at all, but simply bad imitations of
bad English models. It didn’t matter much
where they were produced. As it happened
Adams was put on erven terms with Gals-
worthy, and it would hardly require a genius
to write a play as good as “Joy.” At any
rate, he might have ‘helped to fill an empty
space. But he comes along, smilingly urbane
as ever, and gives us Mrs. Pretty and the
Premier.
My complaint against the author is not
that he has written a bad play—everybody
writes bad plays—but that he has not even
faintly realised that it was his duty to do
his best for Australian drama. Adams was
working for himself, not for the movement;
thinking, maybe, of a motor-launch, and
forgetting altogether that he was making the
road harder for the rest of us.
It matters little, perhaps, m the scheme
of things that Mrs. Pretty is an inepti-
tude, but it is regrettable that the author of
Fleet Street and Bond Street should have
gone over, and without a struggle, to the
camp of the enemy.
LOUIS ESSON.
The Australian Play
Louis Esson asks for Something with a
Cow in It: —
In the conversations reported by Paul
Gsell Rodin tells us the chief lesson the
artist has to teach the modern world is that
the worker should take joy in his work, and
it was the dream of William Morris that
everybody should be an artist, precisely for
the same reason. Long ago the trades and
crafts were handed over to commerce, and
tables and chairs, pots and pans, are now
produced not to serve any natural purpose,
but to glut the “world-market” of the econo-
mists. Hence the modern worker is no
longer an artist, and nobody even expects
art in a candlestick or a kettle, and millions
of money could not rebuild Rheims cathedral.
And in the same way novels and plays
are produced, not because the writer had
something to say and felt the need of expres-
sion, but as a means, usually precarious, of
money making; and so deep-rooted is this
conviction'that it is regarded as a sign of
affectation, even of morbidity, to expect art
in the theatre.
In Greek days the drama was a religious
festival. Sophocles and Euripides did not
write for the sake of “royalties,” and there-
fore retained their dignity as artists. In-
deed we hear that when a certain passage
of Euripides was hissed the on
and asked the audience whether it was their
place to teach him or his place to teach them !
But commerce usurped the place of religion,
and the theatre became what it is to-day,
“an evil disease of the towns.”
It is false doctrine that art is produced
for the sake of money. It never has been,
and is not so to-day. Wagner’s Ring was
not composed as a commercial speculation.
Tolstoi wrote his great tragedy, The
Powers of Darhness, for a people’s theatre,
and without any thought of “royalty.” And
nearer home, the greatest plays written in
English since Webster — Riders to the
Sea, The Well of the Saivm, The Play-
hoy of the Western World, and Deirdre
-—were produced in the Abbey theatre, Dub-
lin, and Synge received nothing for them.
&
The commercial theatre exists for those
who are so depressed by the dreariness of
existence that they wish to escape as far as
possible from art and life. A man must
be in a sorry plight, plunged in black pes-
simism, to take pleasure in a musical
comedy or American farce. Yet these dull
ones form the “market” of the playwright
—the theatre is theirs—and for them hun-
dreds of plays like Mrs. Pretty and the
Premier —soothing draughts—are composed
every season.
Except for some such explanation it
would be a dark mystery why Arthur
Adams should ever have written Mrs.
Pretty and the Premier, and then published
it It must have been a wearisome process
for, as Tchekhof says, nothing is so tedious
as a tedious play. It is impossible the
author could have had any si ons about
it He must have known it was hopelessly
bad, false at the foundation and shaky all
th I oU can find no justification for its exist-
ence. It may be bad enough to earn a long
run on the heathen stage, and the author
may draw £lOOO a week for it, but that is
his concern, not mine. And what has all
that to do with the Repertory movement
and the beginnings of Australian drama.
The first act lasts an hour, and _ there is
nothing in it. “Bill,” the Prermer who
should have been a kind of Abraham
Lincoln, is a dull dog; he has no P
no principles. Mrs. Pretty, a rich widow
and owner of an estate about to be cut up
for closer settlement, comes to see ta on
business, and falls asleep m his room. They
leave together at two in the morning. 1 a
is absurd enough, but we are asked to b-
lieve that a journalist, who saw them depart,
is going to turn the episode into a sensa-
tional scandal. And further, the leader o
the Opposition, who, like the Premier, ex-
presses no political or any other opinions
whatever, announces that the exposure of
the Premier’s private character will be the
first plank in his platform.. “Bill is in .a
quandary, and the whole point of the play
is that he resolves to marry the unknown
lady in order to save his party. Mrs. I retty
again comes to see “Bill,” and invites him
out to her estate at Wyonora. Mrs. Pretty
happens to be engaged to the leader or the
Opposition, who gives her up for no apparent
reason, and the next minute she is ready to
marry “Bill.” The fatuous journalist fills
up the rest of the act, which also lasts about
an hour, and is compelled to hold up his
“story” because Bill tells him that the
mysterious lady was in reality his wite.
The last act is shorter. “Bill’ is. now
married, but it seems his party is going to
be beaten by one vote. He suspects his wite
of deceiving him in order to save her estate.
The lady comes to the House, stuffs up the
division bell with her glove, and detains the
Opposition leader by making outrageous
love to him, and “Bill’s” _ party and the
country are saved. That is the cream of
the story—the other parts, the “comic relief
and so on, are even thinner. •.
A play like that baffles criticism. It is
really tantalising; there is nothing to hit.
To attempt to apply any dramatic principle
to it is like bringing up a howitzer to crush
a mosquito. , .
In an authentic Australian play there
should be a real atmosphere —some. space
and sunshine, wild nature or primitive
character; something with a cow in it
would have been much better ; closer to the
earth and reality. Yet here it is, solemnly
presented at the Melbourne Repertory
Theatre as a contribution to Australian
drama.
The author may say, in excuse, it was
meant only as a light conventional comedy,
something suitable for the commercial stage,
a harmless enough little pot-boiler, and was
never intended for a moment as a work of
art. If that be so, I can only say: Why
wasn’t it so intended? What right has
Adams, on anybody else, to do less than his
best?
Australian Fiction
ITarella Quin (Mrs. Daskein) is one of
the small band of Australian writers who
seriously attempt the Australian novel. Her
work is painstaking, her style fluent, her
knowledge of out-back conditions evidently
close and careful. Her novels are solidly
built, not loosely flung together. A Desert
Rose marked her entrance into the narrow
held; and though Kerno: A Stone (lieine-
mann) does not announce her achievement,
it in many ways, shows a maturity of power
of which the earlier work prophetically
hinted. Mrs. Daskein writes, after all, only
the ordinary novel; but it is a good sample
of the ordinary novel set indubitably in a
real Australia. It is her brilliant descrip-
tions of tbe extreme out-back country _ that
give this novel its chief claim to recognition.
MrSr Daskein is unable, however, to depict
with equal vividness the back-blocks of the
minds of her chief characters:' she writes
cleverly enough of her puppets’ spuls, but
she seldom penetrates very deeply into the
difficult country of psychology. Her men,
except when they are “character parts, are
not convincing. Her hero she fails to make
heroic, and her heroine remains, despite lov-
ing care in description, indefinite and vague.
Her hero, Wynne, is a Melbourne soli-
citor, who is indirectly the means of a woman
leaving her brutal husband. She flies to
the back-blocks, to Wynne’s station, and
there learns gradually to become a dweller
of the plains. Her husband divorces her,
and at last her lover comes to her. They
are married and settle down on the station.
It is not till their child is born that Wynne,
whose whole interests are in the city, makes
a determined effort to identify himself with
the life of the station. His wife knows that
he has sacrificed a brilliant career for her.
In the end he becomes a capable station
owner, and on his first return to civilisation
dies. That is all. The romance of this
story is hardly dwelt upon; its interest lies
somewhat in the delineation of the contrast-
ing characters of three men on the station,
but, mostly, in the brilliant descriptions of
the country farthest out. The rest of the
story is built, apparently, laboriously, upon
the familiar lines of the usual library novel:
the descriptions of the country out-back
afford its only, but _a very real, Australian
value. This novel, with all its _ weaknesses,
is sincere, and sincerely Australian.
Mary Grant Bruce, author of the well-
known Nor ah of Billahong and other kid
stories, has got the right knack. Her latest
yarn for Australian girls and boys, Grays
Hollow (Ward, Lock), is a cheerful, whole-
some Australian country story. _ A badly-
brought-up Sydney family of children have
to stay at Buntoora with their bush cousins
for a year. The mutual antagonism
between the town and country mice is very
real; but the interesting narrative shows
the breaking down of the barriers between,
and the education of the Sydney children by
the healthy work and fun of the bush. Just
the sort of story for all good little girls and
all naughty little boys.

WINCHESTER
20, 16 AND 12 GAUGE
Lightweight Hammerless
Repeating Shotguns
The Winchester Model 1912 is the strongest, safest and
most perfect repeating shotgun ever made. In either of the
three gauges in which it is made, it is lighter, better
balanced and more correctly proportioned than any other
repeater. Its Nickel steel construction, solid breech,
and its cross-bolt trigger lock make it strong and safe.
This gun has a smooth and easy action, a simple
take-down system, and its shooting qualities are not
excelled by the highest priced double guns. The 20
gauge weighs about 5 3 /i pounds, the 16 gauge about
6 pounds, and the 12 gauge about 7 % pounds.
If in the market for a shotgun, don’t fail to

Is this one of your
“Don’t-want-to” Bays?
Some days you feel bright and happy and full of
the joy of life. On others you feel just as dull.
When these depressing feelings are upon you, you
don’t want to eat, you don’t Want to work, you
don’t want to do anything ! The truth of the
matter is, you have a touch of biliousness, or in
other words, your liver is out of order and digestion
disturbed. On such occasions, it is not really a

A REPUTATION OF OVER 100 YEARS.
Cockle’s Pills were originated by a well-known English doctor
especially for disorders of the liver and digestion, and although
dispensed by him only privately at first, they were so successful
that their fame soon spread all over the world. If this is one of
your “ don’t-want-to ” days, get a box of Cockle’s Pills at once;
take two to night and to-morrow
you will feel like a new man.

Penny Postage was instituted
in England in 1840 and many of the letters on

contained requests to Dr. James Cockle, of

his famous Antibilious Pills, which had
then enjoyed a reputation of 40 years.

Can be Developed to Normal.
It matters not if you have been thin and scraggly for years, even if vou
never were properly developed your measurements can be increased to normal
and your figure nicely rounded out to pleasing, plump proportions. Jt is
done every day for others —why not you ?
Manager. Falliere Co. Hekeia, N.Z.
Bear Sir.—l am well pleased with the results from using JTlesli-
-I‘ood and the general improvement in my condition, for which
I thank you very much indeed, for my husband and I are both
well pleased.
From the very beginning I improved wonderfully—the giddiness that had bothered
me for years disappeared, as did the rheumatism from my legs. Both of these
troubles had caused me much severe suffering.
. My limbs were thinnest, and they began to noticeably increase first of all, ending
in a nine-inch increase in my hip measurement. A general development now became
noticeable, and my chest and bust filled out.
, . 1 ~h ad now gained all I needed—a full stone in weight. As I have lost neither
lg t nor measurements since stopping the treatment, I consider the results per-
manen . fours very truly, MRS. H. HODGES.
Flesh-Food is totally harmless in every respect. Its efficacy is beyond question, and its
use is no demand upon the subject's time. Many cases have gained up to six pounds a week,
and an increase m bust measurement up to eight and ten inches is possible. Flesh-Food offers
relief and development to the thousands of chronically thin women who have despaired of ever
possessing a presentable figure. It is a nerve and tissue food treatment that adds weight and
permanent development to attenuated women. Guarantee given in every case accepted.

STOP
SMOKING!
MOST MEN would cure themselves of the
Tobacco habit if they knew they could
do so easily and without discomfort.
It takes but ten minutes for tobacco to
change the beats of the heart. To keep it up
is to tempt death by Heart Disease, Nervous
Collapse, Tobacco Cancer, and Stomach,
Liver or Kidney Disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a' harmless, vege-
table remedy that will make the user of
tobacco in any form absolutely abandon the
habit for good. It not only destroys the crav-
ing, the desire, the appetite for tobacco, but
restores to health the entire nervoas system,
and aids nature in entirely eliminating from
the system the Nicotine Poison.
You Can Try It FREE.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Aft air on the Cow-catcher.
An Idyll of Ancient Jerusalem.
Unuttered, inexpressible and pale,
liis thought o’ermastered all his beetling
pride;
August as chance before the altar rail
Of his tremendous doom he seemed to slide.
Athwart the thin outblowing of the gale,
As one who grasps at straws in his descent,
And hears tall ghosts of harvest wail “Re-
pent !”
Some blokes might think by this ’e done orl-
right,
’ls bloomin’ gyver was a sight ter see.
’E torks to ’er quite nice an’ all perlite,
Same as er bit er skirt ’e took to tea,
Almost forgettin’ it was Friday night;
’Ee didn’t make no fuss nor she no row,
An’ yet the situation was a cow.
Outflamed the torrent splendor of the eve!
No pause he made, nor any cry arose
From his close lips. He saw the darkness
heave
Its heavy shoulder skywards and the blows
Night smote with force against the brazen
greave
Of headlong day. But calm as brown des-
pair,
He felt the horror ruffling in his hair.
The old cove’s whiskers made a ’oly show,
But I was narked because of wot Bill said.
I. thought it up to any bloke to know
The proper time er day to shut ’is ’ead.
’E got me rag out an’ I told ’im so;
The girl an’ cove ’ad plainly got ’im set,
Though both of them was shick an’ drip-
pin’ wet.
Cold through the heavy dusk I heard the call
Of some tremendous purpose fraught with
pain.
O growing dark, the wormwood and the gall
Against the front of tribulation strain!
Suns shall be smitten, stars from Heaven
shall fall.
And then some other cow may miss the
’bus,
Thinkin’ of stoush and skirt the same as
us !

MARY McCOMMONWEALTH.
Asking a Fairy a Favor.
Pray you, Fairy, as you 101 l there in the dew-
drop all a-glisten,
As you laugh and lave your wings
(Such delicious, impish things!),
Just a moment! Just a moment! Will you
listen? Will you listen?
There’s a favor I would ask
As in pearly light you bask.
You’re so small that if I e’er
Tried to catch you I should miss you ;
You’re so fragile I don’t dare,
Or I’d give my head to kiss you.
Talk of kisses, not a few
Have been lavished, sweet, on you,
Little witch there in the dew
With the moonlight all a-glisten....
Listen, Fairy dearest! Listen !
Somewhere very far away
There’s a person. . . .Ah, she’s gay !
When she walks out in the evening all the
old stars blink and peer,
And are jealous of me here,
While a sharp, swift shaft of Cupid finds the
moonman and the fay ;
For her hair is golden autumn and her eyes
are brownish grey,
And the hair and eyes combine
To enslave this heart of mine.
As for mouths, perchance you may
Know a mouth or two yourself,
You experimenting elf;
But this person’s mouth’s so fraught
With the things that men have sought
Through the ages (never finding just the one
thing they desh*e),
That my brain is wine and fire
When her mouth is pressed on mine
(Fire and wine!),
And the secret’s out in this—
When we kiss,
You might crush the world to pieces (this old
world that’s so absurd),
And I wouldn’t move an eyelash, and I
wouldn’t say a word ;
For I don’t suppose I’d notice, with this
person clinging near me....
Do you hear me, little witch you? Do you
hear me!
Don’t delay,
If you please, now ! Speed away !
Flash across the endless spaces
To the dim, remotest places
Where the truth of love is known
(You can test it bv your own) :
Keep this order in your head,
Leave no world unvisited;
Down below and up above,
Tireless be your quest for love.
Take the truest that you find,
Leaping still from star to star,
Seek the truest near and far
(If the trouble you don’t mind) ;
Then these true loves all combined
Quintessentialised in joy,
You will take without alloy
To that little person gay
(Yes, I’ve almost said my say),
To that radiant person fair
With glad autumn for her hair,
Lay it at her feet and say :
“Here’s a little bit of love
From the man you’re dreaming of.
At the changing of the moon,
Which is very, very soon,
He will bring you oceans more
From his never-ending store.
He is sorry that this bit
Is so small; but play with it
Till he comes with honeymoon—
Which is very, very soon !”
Pray you, Fairy, as you 101 l there in the dew-
drop all a-glisten,
Will you listen? Will you listen?

THE POLICY OF BALLASTING THE
BABY.
Thebe is no good thing which some fool or
scoundrel cannot turn to bad account. Re-
, , , , r, . , .. . „
ligion is believed to be beneficial, yet
been used on a very large scale as a black-
mhiling device and a means of raising money
by false pretences. Heaven has been made
to look like a bad cheque by reason of
; : , . , , , j
clerics and wizards who charged big money
for letting the dying sinner into the Pearly
Gates. A Labor party has much to recom-
mend it, assuming that it doesn’t spend most
of its time in exempting its own crowd from
taxation, and in selling the country in bond-
age to the foreign Private Enterprise money-
lender and the foreign sweater, so that it
may have money with which to buy votes
to-day while it ignores to-morrow. State
ownership of railways is a splendid idea in
the way of Socialistic enterprise, if the
State really owns the railways, and provided
the lines are run in the best interests of the
community. But if the railways are wholly
pawned to financial sharks the State doesn’t
own them. And if they are constructed
mainly in order that well-paid billets may be
supplied to the Government’s supporters, and
are dragged impossible distances by all
manner of crooks and turnings so that all the
trade of the State may go to one big city
which gives the Government a fairly good
support, and in which the private interests
of most of the Ministers lie, they cease to be
Socialistic. They may be Socialistic on the
surface, but underneath they are plain, mean,
ordinary graft, like the records of the Yankee
Meat Trust, and Oil Trust, and the doings of
Fisk and Gould, and of Pierpont Morgan
and Carnegie, ajnd of other persons of their
type. In the same fashion there is much
virtue in public land-ownership. But when
public land-ownership is interpreted as mean-
ing that there is to be just one big city in
the State, and that all the highly profitable
business sites are to belong to the private
landlord, while the State owns a handful of
suburban cottages called Daceyville, and lets
them, with much advertisement, at rents
which make the investment a dead loss, the
blessed inspiration is liable to slump in pub-
lie esteem. The arrangement may secure, for
the Socialistic Government, some political
support from the private landlord ; but, all the
same, it isn’t the real thing. A national army,
employed for purely defence purposes, is
Socialism, and a national army employed on
Kaiser William lines, isn’t. Principles
count. Names and terms and phrases and
catchwords don’t.
* » * »
During the last few weeks a clamor has
arisen for the Issue of Federal Government
paper money on a large scale “in order to
carry on public works,” The demand mostly
comes from N.S.W. Labor Unions, and
amounts like £20,000,000 are spoken of'in
a cheerful fashion. The wages of the men
Who build the public works are to be calcu-
lated at the rates which prevailed before the
war, regardless of what may happen. No-
thing is said about any effort to make sure
that the new public works Will pay their
way, which is a Serious matter, seeing that
the existing public works of the Gqi-ustalk
State are becoming daily less payable. No
remark appears he a gold reserve to secure
repayment of the notes. It is suggested that
they should be withdrawn at the rate of
£1,000,000 per annum, but it is hard to see
how a community which is going into debt
faster than it ever did before, and which has
given up all pretence of paying eVeh the
customary £300,000 or £400,000 per annUm
off its liabilities, can liquidate £.1.000,000 a
year simply because it has suddenly gone
another £20,000,000 to the bad.
* * * *
fiut the supreme joke lies in the demand
that the Australian Government should
issue notes to cover the emergency. The Aus-
tralian Government does issUe notes, but it
Can’t persuade the men who are clamoring
for a stupendous hote issUe to Use them. Od
the published figures the circulation of paper
money is certainly larger than it used to bo.
But id the days whep the private banks
supplied th'Cir own notes what Was called the
"circulation” represented the notes issued to
the public; Fven if a‘bank held £i,ooo,ood
of its own notes; they weren’t reckoned ds
part pf the circulation. Now the notes which
the . Australian Government issUes, to the
banks , dad to the, public are all reckoned ds
"circulation.” The banks hold fully half, of
the entire ohtpfit. As d matter of practice,
the ordinary LdbOr union mad takes no nlord
interest in Government “flimsies” than he
used to do in private bank “flimsies.” The
Labor combinations which demand most
urgently that the Fisher Ministry shall
issue another £20,000,000 worth of rag
money don’t order their members to demand
their wages in rag money, so that the issue
which is already made and is bogged in the
bank cellars shall get into common use. Yet
until that gets out, what is the use of any
further issue?
* * * *
The Bulletin was the first paper in Aus-
tralia to propound a scheme for a large out-
put of Federal paper money on a principle
which would make the circulation permanent
and make panics practically impossible. It
proposed:—
(1) That the banks should be required to hold 40
per cent, of their cash reserves in Federal notes.
(This would inflict no injury on them, for whenever
a bank’s cash reserves diminished by £lOO it could
demand cash for £4O worth of its notes at the
Treasury. At the same time no bank could wreck the
Treasury by demanding gold for £4,000,000 worth of
notes without promulgating the ruinous lie that
£10,000,000 of its cash reserves had disappeared.
Therefore a conspiracy to break .up the Federal note
issue would be impossible.)
(2) That the banks should be required not only to
pay in small notes (£1 and 10s. notes) on demand,
but to offer them in every case.
(3) That the gold fund acquired in exchange for
notes, save for a small cash reserve, should be invested
by the Australian Government in the purchase of State
securities, and that the interest "received on these
securities should be invested in the purchase of more
State securities, until the whole State debts were
extinguished. (Thus the £1 note would be backed
in its first year by 20s. in gold and saleable securi-
ties, and tlie reserve would steadily accumulate, so
that a time would come when the £1 note would be
backed by £lOO in gold and saleable securities. And
at the end of things the huge Australian debt would
be extinguished without its extinction costing the
community a penny.)
* * * *
The proposal, it is needless to say, aroused
little enthusiasm. Nobody who knew any-
thing of finance doubted the figures. They
were obvious enough unless the compound
interest talkie is a dream or a jim-jam. The
idea of requiring banks to hold 40 per cent,
of their cash reserves in Federal paper and
to pay out small heueral notes on demand
is an old and tried and successful Canadian
proposition'. But Canada “blewed” the
money it received for its notes as current
revenue. The Australian Government was
not so low down as thgt, so it felt that the
only honest use it could make of such a
scheme would be to buy up State securities
and extinguish the State debts. The job
would be a long one, g.nd the benefit would
go to posterity, and toe general attitude of
Australian ' politicians is that posterity
doesn’t matter, and is a darned nuisance to
boot. Apparently it would rather damage
posterity than do otherwise. So several
millions which might already have been
earned and,devoted to the repurchase of State
lOU’s from foreign holders remain un-
earned ; while the Federal note issue is left
on the old, uncertain footing. Even the
first Fisher Government considered it easier
to let these millions slide overboard than to
draft a few clauses which would not only
benefit itself but serve the interests of the
folk who will come after us. The folk who
will come after us have no votes. They are
of no account.
* * * *
But, as already mentioned, a new fervor
has arisen. The Labor unions supply the
fervor. It is urged—this is a weary repeti-
tion, but repetition is unavoidable at times
—that the Commonwealth should issue
£20,000,0008 of additional paper, though the
Lord only knows to whom it is to be issued,
seeing that the mass of the people have done
so little in- the way of using the issue which
already exists. Nothing is said about a gold
reserve against the new liability. (This is
more repetition.) Nor is anything said about
a scheme of repayment, beyond a bare sug-
gestion that £1,000,000 a year should be
repaid. There is something humorous about
this bare or undressed suggestion, seeing that
it is advanced by the crowd which solemnly
promised to start a general repayment of the
old N.S.W. debt, and promptly began to add
to the debt at an unprecedented rate, and
also suspended even the scrap of repayment
which existed before it attained to office.
The purpose of the proposed note issue is to
build unprofitable public works (all new
works in N.S.W. are unprofitable under the
present regime) so that the people may not
be driven to honest manufacturing business.
For if they were driven to honest manufac-
turing business they would necessarily mate
something, and by that act they would dimin-
ish the importation of German pianos and
beer and chemicals, and Austrian matches,
and United States boots and slop clothes. It
is an accursed act to interfere with these
importations even if they have to be paid tor
out of loans, for the deed may raise the
fiscal issue,’* and if the fiscal issue rises it
may reduce the traffic which is carried on by
foreign ships, So the Labor unions are
sLong on the idea of adding £20,000,000 to
the public debt, and employing the money to
build a railway from Sydney to some back-
blockery that has been losing population tor
20 years or more,
* * * *
As already hinted at, there is fio idea so
good that some ass can’t turn it to a bad
purpose. Thus a police force may be used
to protect the community, or it may be em-
ployed to arrest anybody suspected of
enlightened ideas, and send him to moulder
in a dungeon. A lavish Government, note
issue may be employed, as indicated in an
earlier part of this article, to drag posterity
out of debt without the operation costing
anybody an extra penny, and without doing
anything to accelerate tile habit of depend-
ing on foreign loans and foreign goods. And
it may be employed to make a temporary
splash of easy, Well-paid jobs run on ‘‘Gov-
ernment stroke” principles, the result being
to iehve the country With more debt, less
self reliance, iess permanent, employment,
and a depreciated currency. ’The first pro-
position would have made this country, at
no cost, a much brighter proposition for our
grandchildren; but it didn’t get a hearing,
even from such a mdn aS Andrew FIsher,
because the motto of the steady Australian
borrower is that the baby should be well
ballasted With debt ih order to keep hiifi
(and her) Oh an even keel. The second
positioh, how widely advocated —that Federal
notes should be issued so that the old man of
the thomhnt may be employed at high Wages
on unprofitable enterprises, while the coufi-
try’s Stock of gold goes to pav for the goods
lie won’t take the trouble to make himself—
means leaving posterity to redeem the notes,
and also to pay the debts the old man in-
curred for the purchase of foreign goods.
On the general principle of ballasting the
baby it meets witli a great deal of accept-
ance. The objection to the baby appears
incurable.
JOHNSON AND THE SYDNEY “TELE-
GRAPH” VERSUS THE COMMON-
WEALTH (MA STATE CO-RE-
SPONDENT).
On Friday last week the Sydney Telegraph
broke out with two complaints, quite in the
old style, about the alleged downtroddenness
of the Ma State. One was a leader en-
titled “An Impudent Request,” the request
being put forward by S.A. that the long-
promised transcontinental line between
Oodnadatta and Pine Creek should at least
be commenced. With a howl of honest in-
dignation it was alleged that the. Common-
wealth had been “bulldozed” into promising
this railway. The other was a letter from
W. E. Johnson, presumably the same per-
son of poor judgment who sat on an alli-
gator thinking it was a log. (At all events
a certain politician named Johnson was
accused of having sat on an alligator, in the
Northern Territory, with the firm belief that
it was a log, and when the alligator started
for the horizon it proved a great deal less
firm than the belief. This report, so far
as The Bulletin is aware, never con-
tradicted.) Johnson’s compiaint was that
the delay in establishing the Federal city ,in
N.S.W. was a gross injustice to the
Community. The Ma Community, he said,
had rejected “the original proposals for
Federation,” but had been induced to go
back on its decision for two reasons. One
was that “eminent public men” had assured
it that the cost of Federation would not
exceed 2s. Gd. per head per annum. The
other was that the Federal city would be
established in N.S.W. And on both these
points Johnson, who is said to have tried
to muse on the roof of the alligator, held
that Ma has been disgracefully sold.
* * * *
It is worth w r hile to put the two com-
plaints side by side. In the first place,
N.S.W. didn’t reject “the original proposals
for Federation” in any honest sense. It
accepted them by a solid majority, and the
affirmative vote far exceeded the 50,000
which was specified in the agreement under
which N.S.W. invited the other States to
join in the Federal proceedings. The
acceptance was made null and void-because
the political party of Johnson and Reid
and “Jawbone” Nield had no more
idea of political honor or respect for
treaties than the Kaiser had about his
guarantee of Belgian neutrality. In their
small way they were all Kaisers, and hav-
ing broken their pledge and nullified the Ma
State’s acceptance of the Federal Constitu-
tion, they bulldozed the other States into
granting N.S.W. possession of the capital,
failing which they would wreck the whole
movement —the movement which N.S.W.
had inaugurated.
* * * *
On the other hand South Australia made
no stipulations, nor did it bulldoze any-
body. It came into the Federation, largely
through Kingston’s influence, without con-
ditions. It brought in just one difficulty,
but that difficulty wasn’t of its making. The
Northern Territory had reverted to British
control when the tired legislators of N.S.W.
refused to be troubled with the remote place
any longer. It was liable to be attached -to
India, or Hong Kong or Singapore, or leased
to a syndicate, or otherwise turned into
a colored labor settlement. South Aus-
tralia, despite its small population and its
lack of resources, stepped into the breach.
It secured a sort of lease of the unprotected
back-door of Australia, with a promise that
the Territory would really become part of
Australia when two hard conditions were
fulfilled —the construction of an overland
telegraph line and the construction of a
transcontinental railway from Port Augusta
to Port Darwin. The telegraph line was
built, and the railway partly built, when the
Commonwealth took over six States and the
partially-completed obbeations of the Terri-
tory. Still, as already mentioned, South
Australia demanded no special terms. It
didn’t threaten to sell the Territory to
Tibet or Germany unless it received extra
consideration. It didn’t turn dog on the
Federal bargain, or demand that the Aus-
tralian capital should be fixed at Gawler.
Prime Minister Deakin, however, was a
far-seeing man, even if he was too kindly
and affable to be a strong man, and he
recognised that it was a grievous danger if
523,000 square miles of Australia were held
on a dubious title. So he gave South
Australia the surprise of its life by offer-
ing to take over the Territory. And when
S.A. had got over its astonishment at meet-
ing a politician who wanted to do big things,
ic assented.
* * * *
Nobody has proposed for a moment to
repudiate the agreement, no matter by what
devious ways it was arrived at, that the
Australian metropolis should be in N.S.W.,
though a whole lot of people, mostly in
N.S.W. and Queensland and mostly of the
Johnson and Sydney Telegraph way of
thinking, have Urged that the agreement with
South Australia —the agreement which was
originally forced Upon the old Province by
the British Government, and which the Com-
monwealth assumed —should be repudiated.
It was at the end of 1907 that the Territory
and the liability to finish the transcontinental
railway became Commonwealth property. It
was in 1910 that Yass-Canberra —the scene
of the drought and the small-pox—was legally
settled as a capital site, The matter might
have been settled and the building of the con-
tinent’s metropolis have been started much
sooner, but difficulties arose. The crowd to
which Johnson, the misguided person who
fell into profound thought oh the alli-
gator, belongs, laid it down ( that all
N.S.W. outside a narrow radius around
Sydney is foreign and accursed, and
they spent So mUcli time in wiping out the
original Federal capital in N.S.W. (the one
on the ever-flowing Snowy Bitet) that it
wasn’t till four years ago thgt the present
Dry Babylon was really pegged out. And
then hew delays arose. South Australia
cheerfully threw in 523,000 sqUafe miles of
country ds its contribution to the Common-
wealth. The mean and shabby JOHNSON
people in N.S.W. objected to. giving more
than 100 square miles for a Federal centre,
even when they had srot it located at their
own pet site. And as regards a Federal port
they offered 10 square miles ending at high-
water mark, so that no ship could reach the
port unless it had wings. This brutal and
parish-minded levity caused a great loss of
time and argument. Further, the Johnson
importing crowd decided to hire a United
States man to build the capital, and certain
foreigners—one of them an Austrian, of all
people—to select the best plan. Now the
Hungarian can’t act because he has gone
to the war. And the Sydney Tele-
graph, which represents the Johnson party,
didn’t help things by stating that the Federal
capital, at its own lamentable Canberra, could
never be more than “a large country town.”
That expressed the Telegraph’s fixed con-
viction that the metropolis of Australia would
be a mere shabby suburb of Sydney. It
wasn’t calculated to incite the Australian
Government to spend money recklessly on the
place with the idea that it was a great in-
vestment.
* * * *
Still a good deal of money has been spent
on Canberra since it was established in 1910,
despite the efforts of the Johnson party to
kill it by making its port stop at high-water
mark, and despite the fact that the Austrian
expert has gone to the war. And
though the Northern Territory and the
obligation to finish the railway were
taken over in 1907 nothing has been done.
Yet the Canberra capital is a mere matter of
local vanity, while the railway to Port Dar-
win is an urgent question of national defence.
The Commonwealth has strained its resources
to the utmost to please Johnson. And even
tbe unauthorised promise that Federation
wouldn’t cost the community more than
2s. 6d. per head per annum seems to have
been kept. The Commonwealth certainly has
a large expenditure, for military, naval,
postal, telegraph, telephone, lighthouse,
quarantine, meteorological and other services
of which it has relieved the States, and for
subsidies to the States ; but as regards new
Federal expenditure it appears to have kept
carefully inside the figure of 2s. 6d. per head
per annum, despite the foolishness of raising
Johnson’s salary. Taking one thing with
another, the case, Sydney Telegraph and
Johnson versus the Commonwealth, with the
aggrieved Ma State as co-respondent, is dis-
missed with Costs.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Semi-Pauper Female in the
Transparent Tent.
One of the makeshift devices of the hour is
the establishment of a calico township in a
sandy, dusty, flea-haunted Sydney suburb.
There are to be 500 houses to begin with,
and they are to be rented at one bob per
week with earthen floors, or a bob and a half
per week with wooden floors. The bunga-
lows or rag skillions are to be each Bft. this
way and 10ft. that way, and they will be
6ft. high, so that only a tall man will knock
against the roof unless he has his imported
belltopper on. There will be two
calico apartments in each mansion, and
there will be a shower bath to each group
of 24 palaces. Every castle will have its
private and confidential garbage tin. The
combustible residences will be 20ft. apart,
so that they can’t all burn at the same
moment. The places being practically
transparent, the hoodlums of the neighbor-
hood will probably gather in great force,
and whistle or hoot when the female . popu-
lation is going to bed. A galvanised iron
chimney is promised, but it isn’t assured by
any international guarantee. The property
is to be erected with borrowed money, and
it is regarded as a sort of pauper enter-
prise. In other words, it isn’t supposed
that, at a rent of one bob with an earthen
floor, or one bob and a half with a board
floor, the transparent homes in which the
lady who is getting into bed is visible to the
public gaze will pay their way. Still,
desperate diseases require desnerate remedies.
During September, N.S.W. went about
£760,000 into debt, and during the last nine

Agents are requested to note
that, as the Christmas Number of
“The Bulletin” is noW going to
press, the orders that reach us from
now on will be treated in order of
priority,
months it went about £8,500,000 into debt,
in order to pay for an excess of imported
goods which might easily be made by its
own people. The goods are not made by
our own people because it is the policy of
Australia to pay 10s. per day for work
that is done elsewhere for ss. per day, and
to supply a tariff equal to about Is. a day
to make things level. Then it borrows
immense sums abroad to prevent the land
being drained of all its cash resources to
pay for imports. In other words, it heaps
up debts to pay for lack of employment. It
is a whale for buying lack of employment.
The present time is one when Australia,
with a sane tariff and less of the borrow-
ing craze, ought to be on the top of a wave
of prosperity. It has paid a mere trifle
towards the war expenditure. It has suf-
fered no damage through the war. Of its
manufacturing competitors. Germany and
Austria are disqualified; Belgium is oblit-
erated ; Northern France (the manufactur-
ing region of France) is badly crippled;
Russia is also, badly crippled because it has
sent most of its able-bodied population to
the battle line, and one of its biggest manu-
facturing cities has been occupied by the
enemy. So Australia, with its “magnifi-
cent natural resources.” should be acquiring
population by hundreds of thousands, and
sending its manufactured goods to the ends
of the earth. Instead of that its proudest
State is struggling harder than ever to
borrow money, and its proudest city pro-
poses to house its pauper womenkind at one
hob a week in transparent calico tents with
earthen floors (tents bought out of loan
funds), so that the lurker may lurk outside
and watch their configuration as they go to
bed. If there isn’t something wrong with
the foreign loan and foreign importation
policy, then what is wrong? Is Australia a
failure? Or is the female who is going to
bed a failure?
A Job Which Is Never-ending.
The Peace Society cranks are already begin-
ning to forecast that the end of the War
will mean the end of armaments. The
notion is that Germany will be stamped flat,
and that, with the arch-enemy of Peace dis-
posed of, no one will want to arm. Then
will follow .an idyllic period, during which
Australia’s. Fleet will be stripped of guns
and used for advertising or such other pur-
poses as may be suggested by King O’Mal-
ley, M.P. One of the many flaws in the
forecast is the circumstance that Germany,
no matter how badly beaten, will not be
eliminated as a Power. Britain could not
allow anything of the sort, even if the other
European nations were willing, since a mod-
erately strong Germany represents one of
Britain’s insurances against destruction. If,
as seems certain, the War ends, in the defeat
of Germany, that inflated nation will be
called upon to pay a record indemnity; it
will have to yield up Alsace-Lorraine and
its colonies ; it may find itself left without a
fleet worth mentioning. But it will be to no
one’s interest to dismember it. Within
another half-century the German army may
be fighting beside French and British soldiers
against the invading legions of an awakened
Asia. Britain has had a horrible lesson in
the folly of unreadiness in the present un-
pleasantness. Good judges have noted that
if Kitchener had had a million troops ready
for service at the beginning of the trouble —
a trouble which all those who were best
qualified to judge saw was inevitable sooner
or later —there would have been no war.
In a sense, therefore, the crucifixion of
Belgium and the wiping-out of the flower of
half a dozen nations lies at the doors of the
well-meaning 1 fools who opposed compulsory
service in the United Kingdom because they
disliked strife and bloodshed. The British
people, faced with the obligation to produce
within a year or less an army of 500.000
men. with officers and equipment complete,
realise the size of their past mistake and are
unlikely to perpetuate it. They have taken
their last chance as regards allowing a pos-
sible sea-rival to become established on the
other side of the Strait of Dover. A win
for the Allies, while giving the death-blow
to the fashion for volunteering which now
inspires the nation, will mean the birth of a
universal service movement. The same
result must follow in the now almost un-
thinkable event of Germany smashing the
French on the one hand and the innumerable
armies of Russia on the other. In that
astounding case, with a great naval Power
holding commanding positions in the Channel
and the North Sea, Britain’s inhabitants
would not, could not, cease from feverishly
fitting themselves to deal with possible in-
vaders. The position_ of the Peace Societies
is, therefore, if anything, more hopeless than
ever it was. All the nations that ever had
compulsory service are going to stick
to it, and a few more that hadn’t
it _ in the confiding days of old are
going to take to it. For example,
if Germany comes out on top or anywhere
near thereto, the United States will have
to change its ways. The British eX-First Lord
was not speaking through his hat when lie
told his mother’s fellow-countrymen that if
Germany won it_ would be their turn next.
With sea-power in the hands of the Kaiser
the Monroe doctrine Would have as much
chance of being respected as the neutrality
of Belgium; and the U.S., with their present
army of volunteers, would have no say
whatever in the matter.

The Time That Is Not Yet Ripe*
This is a recent outpouring by Charlton,
M. for tbe Hunter (N.S.W.). the
occasion being an Eight-hours Day stnoke
concert at Newcastle
He did not believe in the shortening df hours dr
days for the laborer.. There was no reason why the
States should not combine to FIND MONEY for the
different works to be carried oht in Australia.
They ought to Be able To arrange to carry out
IN ONE YEAft WOttKS WHICH WOULD, IN NORMAL TIMES,
BE DONE IN THREE YEARS,
And by that remark CiiAMlton, M.11.R.,
apparently meant that the borrowing habit
should be trebled, and that, where N.S.W,
now spends from £8,500,000 to £10,000,000
a year of loan money, it should proceed to
“blew” from £25,000,000 to £30,000,000 a
year. The beaming and incompetent political
ass always regards loans and public works as
the line of least resistance. They are handy
for buying votes, and they are convenient
for the purchase of applause. Anybody can
pay high wages for short hours when he is
spending other people’s cash with no regard
for the future. It requires brains and labor
and technical knowledge to establish self-
supporting industries and make the country
pay its way, but any crude and roaring
benefactor can propose that a State with
less than 2,000,000 people should spend
£30,000,000 of high-priced foreign capital per
annum on the job of putting an insolvent
railway into everybody's back yard, and a
burst artesian bore into everybody’s front
garden. The proposition places him on the
same high moral pedestal as the kindly soul
who planned tb give everything to everybody,
and to extract gold from paving stones and
sunshine from cucumbers. Meanwhile the
fact remains that N.S.W. imports so much
more than it exports that it is being drained
of money to pay for foreign goods. And it
is floating foreign loans day and night, and
pawning itself to the foreign money-lender,
to repair the drain. And by reason of the
fact that it prefers to buy foreign hats and
shoes rather than make the things by its
own industry its people depend for employ-
ment on still more loans, and use them to
build things that often don’t pay for
axle-grease. Of course the disease can’t
be repaired unless somebody puts a
lot of hard thinking into the process,
and that sort of thing is a nuisance to the
slummocky legi ’ator. It is far easier to
orate in the old, well-trodden fashion at a
Newcastle smoke concert. Incidentally, the
man who tries to do something in his own
day and generation is liable to be found
out and discredited, and to lose his job, if
he makes a mess of things. On the other
hand the man who leaves the responsibility
to posterity has a chance of being dead before
posterity finds him out. The process of
sinking the fiscal issue isn’t exactly prin-
ciple and it isn’t exactly policy. It is only
cowardice and lack of mentality. One
notable reason why the Labor party in
N. shouldn’t abolish its local Upper
House is that it and its Upper House are
so much alike. That dreary institution has
a fixed idea in certain matters that the
time is not yet ripe. On practically every
important especially on the
question >why this copntry should keep its
people out of work swhile it incurs huue
debts for the purchase of chemicals and
boots and sundries, much of them from its
enemies—the Labor party also holds that
the time is not yet ripe. It has been of that
opinion all its life.
The Only Way.
These annual window exhibitions of Austra-
lian manufactures are good and pretty, and
explain to peonle that the Australian can
do a lot of things as well as anybody else
and a good deal better than most; but in the
way of advancing Australian manufactures
it is doubtful if they really amount to a
packet of needles. Everybody with an ear
has heard people say lately that “it will be
no good anybody trying to sell German goods
after the war is over.” And everybody with an
eye has seen the same people, a few hours
later, drinking German lager. In any case,
how can the average citizen tell whether
imported builders’ furnishings, for instance,
are made in Germany or Austria or Belgium?
The only way to effectively encourage Aus-
tralian products is by a tariff that will make
them less expensive than imported ones.
People who have had a window broken lately
will have appreciated the beauty of a country
that imports all its glass. By reason of the
fact that practically all Australia’s importa-
tions of this fragile stuff came from
Europe, the price of common window glass
has sprung from 4d. to Bd. per square foot,
and even the Kaiser can’t say where it will
stop. When Germany and France and Bel-
gium get their industries going again, a
month or a year or a decade hence, there
will be a lot of broken windows to mend ;
but after that they will be prepared to dump
glass at Id. a foot. So, unless assured of a
genuinely Protective tariff, no Australian is
likely to tackle the sheet and plate glass-
making industry. Yet there is a fine field.

The Wowser-McMoses Alliance.
Gann, N.S.W. Acting-Premier while Willy
Holman is resting, has stated definitely that
the Government does not intend to introduce
a Totalisator Bill this session. Also it was
recently announced that, owing to the claims
ot patriotic funds, the benevolence of the
wealthy in support of the hospitals had
fallen off to such an extent that the Govern-
ment had been obliged to go to the rescue of
these institutions. The statement reflects
on the benevolence of the wealthy of Sydney,
but it reflects still more on the _ present
system of hospital management, which fails
when it is most hecessary that it should not
fail. Already the Government supplies 75
per cent, of the hospital revenue, and if it
has to supply any more it might as well foot
the whole bill and bUmp private benevo-
lence off the box-seat. If the Government
introduced the Totalisator, and earmarked
the revenue for the support of the hospitals,
nationalising those institutions, it could not
only improve the management of things that
have been very much mismanaged, but finally
do away with an unseemly system of cadg-
ing. The Unholy WoWser-McMosES alliance
seems to have a singularly tight hold oh
Ma’s apostate Labor party.

“Tarry Koße's” snort of indignation I
While the patriotic British shipowner is loudly
voicing the glorious traditions and splendid abilities
Of the British seaman he is manning his ships with
Chows, Chows being cheap. The other day, in this
port Of Newcastle, a British ship took ChowS in
preference to British seamen, aha the master ad-
mitted frankly that it was ail a matter of money..
The veSsei in this case was Glasgow-owned, and
Came here with Germans amongst the crew. The
authorities took the Gerihans Oht. The master,
to make up his complement, took 13 Chows from ah
interned steamer, and placed them aboard his ship
to live under the same fo’c’s’le-head as the white
crew. The Britishers objected. They had signed on
with whites, even if some of them were German, and
they naturally refused to be herded with yellows.
For this they were arrested and marched through
the streets under police escort; their clothing was
searched and an inventory made; and then they
were tried in a British Court of Justice. They were
discharged, with an admonishment to obey all lawful
commands. Again, the Chows being still herded
with them, they refused to go on; and again the
police went aboard and arrested them. They were
this time sentenced to 24 hours’ imprisonment. Next
day they were taken from the gaol under police
escort and placed on board the British ship, the lines
were cast off, and the vessel sailed, with the white
portion of the crew still protesting against sailing
with Chows in the fo’c’s’le, a thing they had never
agreed to do. Surely, it is not for “liberties” such
as this that British sailors are laying down their
lives to make Britain mistress of the sea ! Frankly,
who are we fighting for—for skinflint Glasgow owners
who, so far as they are concerned, would sweep the
sea of British seamen because the Asiatic is cheaper ?
If the British sailor is fighting his own battles, and
not the Chinaman’s, then, in the name of common
fairness, let us quit giving any sympathy to the
owner who will madly cheer the gallant British
seaman to-day and starve him to-morrow. Let’s put
that owner where he belongs—among the contemptible
herd who are patriots just so long as patriotism pays
them.
Thinking Black.
Under the headline “Thinking Black” the
S. M. Herald lately published the tale of an
interesting missionary named Crawford, who
has mished in Africa for 23 years, and is
now visiting Sydney. Crawford (front
name Daniel) held that city life is a mad,
unwholesome business (which may be the
case) ; and by way of evidence mentioned
that Cain, the first murderer, afterwards
went forth and built a city. But Cain was
the second agriculturist as well as the • first
murderer and the first city-builder; and it
was in his agricultural stage that he com-
mitted murder by slaying the first squatter.
And seeing that there were then, according
to the Scriptural story (which missionary
Crawford appears to take in a literal sense),
only four people in tbe world (Adam, Eve,
Cain and the unspecified female whom Cain
married) the term “city” must surely be a
mistake. No one, save Macaulay, hints
that there were palaces in “Cain’s imperial
town,” and even Macaulay doesn’t accuse
Cain of tramcars. There is a Syrian guide-
book which alleges that the homicidal wheat-
grower built Baalbec “in a moment of
frenzy,” but that is hardly evidence. Pro-
bably Cain built a humpy, or stuck a branch
in the ground to keep off tbe wind. Then the
S. M. Herald’s missionary remarked: “You
never see God in a hurry.” The reverend
gentleman evidently disbelieves in haste. Yet
the Deity who started off thousands and
millions of planets at a pace which no ex-
press train can approach must have hurried
at times. Furthermore, the eloquent gentle-
man who objects to our complicated civilisa-
tion, said that he found in Africa a verb
with 32 tenses and a noun with 19 genders,
and that he staggered the simple-minded
University of Oxford with these products. A
verb with 32 tenses seems quite as bad as a
railway terminus with eight, or even 16,
lines of rails. He said that in Africa he had
only the Bible, and was quite away from
“the miserable cemeteries called libraries.”
And he finished with a sort of apology for
cannibalism. This comes of “Thinking
Black.” For goodness sake, let us think
white —or at least brown, or striped.

In the intervals between the gusts of patri-
otic cheering, low wails are heard from those
interested in keeping the local charities afloat.
The poor Belgian, it appears, is being helped
at the expense of the sick and poor Aus-
tralian, and presently, when there is less
money in the country than there is at pre-
sent, some of the local charities are going
to rock on their foundations. The trouble is
that the local charities depend for their daily
bread on theatrical appeals and sentiment;
and when an appeal that is more theatrical
comes along, it naturally sucks in all the
money that previously flowed to the regular
shows. Some volunteer charity workers seem
to be indignant because the springs of char-
ity ftre ilot springing twice as hard to meat
the suddeb demand ■ but that was never the
Why of springs. If the hospitals and so
forth are Still living on the passing hat when
the present disturbance is ovei*, the ighoble
old headgear will deseiwe to be fitted with a
halo instead of a mere band, and. after that
it will be a fair thing to pension it off. The

JjAVlb HAiXi N.SI.W. Attofdey-Genefal, has
intimated hoiise-owdefs will be well
advised not to ptess for their teats ffoid
tenants who have lost money by the war,
else the Govethmedt may be
driven to interfere. The idea is a humane
one, yet there is a lack of logic about the
humanity. The landlord is in a peculiar
position. A hard-hearted grocer can cease
giving credit when the account is a day
overdue, and cast his customer forth into a
sugarless, fishless, baconless, breadless world.
He doesn’t need to leave the non-financial
customer in possession of his shop so that
he may do unreasonable damage, while he
takes long and expensive ejectment proceed-
ings to deprive him of the free run of the
molasses keg and the cheese bin and the
butter barrel. A hard-hearted barrister can
leave off in the middle of a case if his
refresher isn’t forthcoming. But the land-
lord has his tenant in possession, and has to
keep on giving him credit and every possible
chance to destroy the goods, until the long,
lingering arm of the law comes to his aid
with an ejectment order. He can’t throw
the customer out at a moment’s notice, as
the grocer and the butcher and the lawyer
can throw out their clients. David Hall,
being a kindly sort of man and full of good
intentions, should consider this aspect of
the case. While the war lasts it might be a
fair thing for. the gentleman of the law to
reduce his fees and to give long credit to the
harassed plaintiff and the badgered
defendant. The landlord is often a bad lot
and a vile rack-renter, but at least, when
he takes rent for a bouse he supplies a
house. There are innumerable cases on
record when a barrister has accepted a brief
and collected a fee for his services, and has
never even appeared on the horizon.
“0.K.” : After all, wouldn’t it be better for
Britain to deport Germans than to intern
them? My idea would be to send them back
in shiploads to their Fatherland, so that
they might carry out their obligation to the
Kaiser by fighting for him. The objection
to deportation is the military objection; but
a few more thousand Germans (most of
whom don’t want to fight) added to the
Kaiser’s millions in the field would be less
likely to injure the British cause than their
continued residence in the country which
now acts as their host. As for humani-
tarian objections to transhipment—well,
look at the German military expulsion of
Belgian civilians from their country! To
intern a German is to make an enemy of
bim—if he wasn’t one already—and to retain
and feed an enemy within your gates is a
•foolish way of working for the national
Cause. For 20 years these people have
wanted war, and their preparations for it
are their national boast in this hour of
uproar. Why not let them have their belly-
ful of it instead of holding them and mak-
ing guests of them —for what? That they
may presently resume their billets, specula-
tions and social influence, whilst loyal citi-
zens in worn-out boots are looking for a job.
Britain is sending troops to kill all the
Germans it can, and at the same moment it
is taking costly;' measures to keep people of
the same nation alive. This strikes me as
being tbe limit in the inconsistency of
modern warfare. Prisoners taken on the
field are at least returned at last to the land
they belong to. Interned captives are merelv
turned loose again on the land they don't
belong to.
From John D. Fitzgerald, chairman of
the N.S’.W. Housing Board: —
In March of this year The Bulletin published
some criticisms of the Dacey Garden Suburb scheme,
which Were based upon the report of the Auditor-
General (N.S.W.). I replied at the time, and made
the statement that the Board “must wait till the
next report of the Auditor-General would vindicate
us.” That report is now published, and does vindi-
cate us. The bone of contention between the Board
and the Auditor-General last year was, briefly, that
he, had debited to the houses then built and occupied
the full interest on the cost of a concrete stormwater
drain, which benefits a much larger area than that
actually built upon ; and the cost of this drain, the
Board maintained, should be spread over the whole
of the estate. The Auditor-General this year has
come round to this view, with the result that, after
providing for management, rates, insurance, main-
tenance, etc. (£583), and interest and sinking fund
( £2290), there is a profit of £lO3l for the year.
On which The Bulletin observes that,
though a drain may have been the only
bone of contention between the Housing
Grey Wolves Grey.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Russian march is soft and slow,
Through dust and heat, or slush and sboW,
AVhen the Russian skies hang grey and low
To the frontiei’s far where the Russians go j
And they march to-night and they march to 11
day
Like the grey wolves grey, like the grey
wolves grey.
Nor song nor sound their track reveals,
Save the ceaseless “clock” of the waggon
wheels ;
But a rift in the mist shows a glint of sun
On the long, dark shape of a toiling gun;
And they strain by night and they drag by
day
To a distant goal, like the grey wolves grey.
As the horses toil at the ends of trains,
And the ends of roads on the Blacksoil
Plains.
And Ivan digs in the frozen clay,
And he rolls the logs a bed to lay
For a gun that’s five hundred miles away,
But as sure to come as the grey wolves grey.
He is marching on with a purpose grand,
For brother Slav in another land ;
Whose tongue, perchance, he can not under-
stand.—
But he knows the cry from the far-away,
And he smells the blood like the grey wolves
grey.
And Ivan’s wife in her den at home,
While hunger looms and his lean wolves
come—
With her grey-black bread like the Darling
mud,
And her tea-bricks bound with the bullock’s
blood —-
She shields her cubs by night and day
Like the crouching sluts of the grey wolves
grey.
And I march with Ivan where’er he be,
With the foreign blood that is strong in me,
And the love-and the hate that is fantasy,
Tike the ghosts of a father’s memory.
With the blood that is strange to us to-day
As the strange wild blood of the grey wolves
grey.
- Grey Wolves,
* Grey Wolves—
The strange wild blood of the grey wolves
grey.

Board and the Auditor-General, there were
these other bones between the Board and
The Bulletin
(1) In fixing the rent, which is supposed to pay
interest and sinking fund, the Board assumed that no.
cottage would ever be unoccupied.
(2) It also assumed that there would never be a
shilling of rent unpaid. .
(3) It was assumed that an ancient ruin, 25 years
hence, will be bringing in the same rent as the
premises, brand new, bring in to-day.
1 (4) The sinking-fund period was made much too
long ; in other words, the annual sinking-fund contri-
bution is much too small.
In short, the financial basis of the scheme is
of the boomster type ; and there is going to
be the usual deficiency for the baby to meet
by-and-bye —unless changes have been made
during the past 12 months. And appar-
ently they haven’t been made, since the
Board confesses that it couldn’t see any bone
of contention except a drain.
The War, so Far as It Has Gone.
The stupendous iniquity of William the
Great Homicide has enjoyed a few new
developments during the week. In Belgium
and the north of France some more miles
of country and a few towns have been re-
gained by the Allies, at the rate of one
German corpse and half an Allied corpse
per square yard —or thereabouts. It is
hoped the dead Germans are being buried very
deep, else the farmer will turn them up
daily with his plough when he starts farm-
ing again, and the skull that Peterkin
found on the battle-field of Blenheim won’t
be a circumstance by comparison. It is
reported that at one corner of the
show, around Dixmunde, more shells have
already been fired than were used in the
whole Boer war. The Bear progresses in
all his innumerableness, and is shoving the
German out of Poland at a great rate. The
Unspeakable Turk has gone mad at last, and
has staked his all —including Constanti-
nople and 600,000 soldiers —in aid of Ger-
many. The first news of his madness came
when he started, without a declaration of
war, to wreck unfortified Russian towns on
the Black Sea. (He has his own decayed old
fleet and two ironclads lent by Germany,
also a German admiral.) The second sign
of his insanity was his invasion of Egypt,
though it is a very small invasion as yet and
only concerns an outlying patch of sand.
His third evidence of complete lunacy was
the publication of a scheme for the invasion
of India overland, following the track of
Alexander the Great. But it is a long,
long way to the Khyber Pass, and there are
some very hostile people in the way. Appar-
ently the Boer fighter De Wet —he of the
tinted, glasses and the wonderful velocity—
has gone mad also. At least he is accused of
religious mania and has started an insure
rection. So far it seems a very poor sort
of insurrection; possibly too many stop-
pages for prayer retard the wonderful old
flier’s movements, for in his best days De
Wet could race a whirlwind. There has
been a one-horse battle between Belgians
and Germans in Central Africa, and the
result was a Belgian victory. Por-
tugal is alleged to have had its baptism
of fire. At least it is rumored that
the German hordes, three strong, invaded
Portuguese territory in Africa, and were
slain by two policemen—descendants
of Henry the Navigator. A one-sided or
amphibious sea-fight is mentioned on an
African lake. That is to say, the battle was
between a British passenger steamer with
one cannon of a sort, and some German
adventurers with a gun or two on shore.
The star of the Kaiser set in blood or mud
or something; anyhow his forces left.
Servia, after fighting three wars in three
years, admits that it has hardly any money
left amid its brown clothes, and apparently
it will have to stand on the defensive unless
someone helps it with a loan. The sudden
derangement of Turkey has caused Italy,
Greece and Bulgaria to sit up. . Everybody
takes it for granted that they will plunge
shortly in the Allied interest, and then,
with practically everybody of importance in
the war, affairs will be nice and tidy. It
is already being loudly remarked in Italy
and Greece and Bulgaria _ that there
will presently be two Kaisers and a
Sultan to be divided up and eaten,
and only those nations which bore a
hand in the trouble can reasonably hope for a
share of the meat and the gravy. The great
racing event of the year isn’t expected to
be the Derby or the Grand Prix or the Mel-
bourne Cup, but the race for Constantinople.
The original German Commander-in-Chief,
Von Moltke, is in retirement and is alleged
to _be dying. Also one German imperial
prince is mentioned as being paralysed
through shock. It has been a _ week of
small happenings and huge happenings, but,
despite the interference of the mouldy old
Sultan, the general feeling is that things are
going well. Among the things that haven’t
happened at all is news of Francis Joseph
of Austria. The impression that that mis-
fortunate potentate died at least two months
ago grows stronger every time he isn’t
mentioned.

“lolanthe” is the new bill at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney, and most of it arouses
as much enthusiasm as it did a quarter of a
century ago. True, some of the satire grows
a trifle musty. How many members of a
present-day audience, for example, know
who Captain Shaw was or anything about
him? Miss Dorothy Vane plays the name-
part with grace and brightness, and Edward
McKeown is a handsome and tuneful, though
slightly wooden, Earl Tolloller. He seems to
be afraid, to hurl himself into the spirit of the
proceedings for fear of getting hot. Charles
Walenn, excellently made up, is a diverting
Lord Chancellor; and Frank Wilson, as
Mountararat, does justice to his stirring
numbers. Miss Ruth Lincoln, Miss Ethel
Morrison and Miss Pearl Ladd are all good.
The show is booked to run for a fortnight.

revived by the Buckler-Paget company at
Sydney Little Theatre on Saturday, Pinero
not only presents a whole family of wowsers
but concisely indicates their moral attitude
in Sir Daniel Ridgeley’s remark: “When-
ever a word is used that might have two
meanings, a Ridgeley will always take it in
the worse meaning.” In this revival Gerald
Kay Souper is transferred from the part
of Maurewarde to that of Filmer Jesson.
This results in a stronger Jesson and in a
weaker Maurewarde. However, the comedy
affords Hugh Buckler and Violet Paget the
opportunity of excellent characterisations;
and the comedy is throughout technically
and popularly interesting. But the substitu-
tion of Master Jack Buckler for the girl who
previously played the part of the. disagree-
able boy shows that the only possible stage-
boy is a girl.

Large audiences still attend Sydney
Criterion, attracted by the mystery that the
press has loyally preserved about the plot
of “Seven Iveys to Baldpate.”

“The Glad Eye” closes at Sydney Palace
on Friday night. An unconfirmed report
states that immense bodies of curates are
massing in the adjoining hotel and that they
intend to make a supreme effort to take the
theatre at the point of the umbrella and see
the show for nothing. Enormous stores of
buns and milk have been accumulated, and
every umbrella has been fitted with _ a
specially-sharpened ferrule. Beaumont Smith
is said to be feverishly entrenching. On
Saturday the Allen Doo»e season will com-
mence. “The Bold Sojer Boy” is the card.

The friendly little microbe which bites
people and makes them patriotically demand
home-grown goods has fastened on to Sydney
Adelphi, with the result that a made-in-
Australia bellowdrama is in rehearsal for
the next flutter. Unfortunately when it
thinks of Australian drama the Adelphi, _ so
far, can only think of Ned Kelly. Still it’s
better to start from Ned and work up than
begin with (say) Willy and work down.
The new show was due last night (Wednes-
day), but as even the arrival of a “sensa-
tional Australian drama of bushranging life”
is insufficient reason for hanging up publi-
cation, the result of The Bulletin’s post-
mortem cannot be made known for a week.

The Sydney Repertory Society announces
a whole week of Australian drama at the
Repertory Theatre (November 16-21). Two
three-act plays, “Mary Martin” and “Mrs.
Pretty and the Premier” will each have two
performances, and the remaining two nights
will be given up to three one-act plays,
“Trapped,” “The Business Girl” and
“Gerty’s Glad Eye.” According to the
Society’s decision, every play will be pro-
duced without the name of the author on the
programme. This is a wise precaution in
these early days of Australian drama. The
proceeds will go to the Patriotic Fund.

Another Queen has unpacked her crown
jewels at Sydney Tivoli this week, to wit,
“Mdlle de Dio, the World’s Famous
Parisienne Queen of Prismatic Dancers.
The only other sovereign on the premises at
the moment is Miss Florence Smithson, the
advertised “Queen of Song.” However,
Queens are ndt nearly as bad-tempered as
they were once supposed to be. It is under-
stood that there are something like 14 of
them at La Perouse, and everything goes
along quite smoothly. Juggler Torino, Tom
Kelly, and Roberts and Lester —the latter a
pair of clever whistlers—are the other big
guns of the Castlereagh-street programme.

Another consignment of Sydney pictures :
Crystal Palace : “The Sack of Louvain,’’ which
clears the character of the cableman, and settles any
doubt that as a wrecker of homes and burster of
the marriage tie, Billy Hughes isn’t in it with Billy
Hohenzollern.
Colonial : “Freiichy,” one of the cowboy series
which would have changed the Kaiser’s mind had he
seen it before setting out on his trip to Paris.
Empress: “Grand Opera in Rubeville,” a two-reel
burlesque of the Edison Co., possessing the rare
advantage of having nothing whatever to do with the
war.

There’s a chance for any drama
When a kid is in the lead.
Two kids in particular, and other kids occa-
sionally, come in at “The Ever-Open Door”
at Melbourne Princess’s. G. R. Sims seems
to have written this cockney melodrama with
the good business idea of interesting the
London public in the squalor of Westminster,
where the Houses of Parliament are. It is
all about Rescue Work in Westminster. The
characters are pore kids, parsons, church
missioners, burglars, baby farmers, members
of Parliament and the perlice. The neces-.
sary sinful lord is a half-baked villain who
formerly persuaded his cousin’s lawful wife
that she had murdered her lawful baby in a
nursing home and a fit of temporary in-
sanity, whereas the offspring in question is
the live hero of the motley drama. When
his identity is revealed to mother she takes
the rorty urchin to her bosom, together wif
the uvver principal kid, who is a gentle
female orphin wif a korf.

With the exception of Nellie Holroyd and
Vera Huggett in the child parts, and two
or three other people (notably Ivelway as a
chirpy young criminal), the company is
either weak or misfitted. Miss Dorise. as
the long-lost mother, brings only a trustful
Christian smile and a pleasing elocution to
her distressful part. Beckett, the half-
hearted villain, begins in obtrusive shirt-
cuffs and ends in aggressive Spats. The
detective is evidently intended for the
Church; the parson (Rowland Conway)
doesn’t seem the sort of cleric to down the
d —l in a slum parish; and C. R. Stanford,
a ferocious crib-cracksman, suggests a

humanitarian in disguise. The drama is
fairly well staged, but the incidental music,
by an orchestra of five, was sometimes agon-
ising on Saturday night. Strict economy in
orchestra is a matter for pained comment at
other theatres in Melbourne, Sydney and
elsewhere. Even when the large reduction
-in orchestra is concealed from the public.eye
by a trellis covering, the lack of musicians
can be felt. The writer trusts that the. dis-
carded strings and brasses are invariably
German, anyhow.
“The Girl in the Taxi” meets the ease at
Her Majesty’s (Melb.) as fully as one-can
expect under present circumstances. At a
time when no management hopes for boom
business, this musical French comedy seems
quite handsomely done, though the musical
part of it leaves stronger voices to be de-
sired. The comedy runs on time-honored
lines, but probably contains a larger infu-
sion of social impropriety than any other
piece of its type. Moreover, it is more of
a comfort than a caution to sinners, seeing
that nobody gets found out. Guileless re-
spectability, in the person of Millie Engler,
invites everybody to supper at the restaurant
where dissipation has lately escaped dis-
covery, and the head-waiter returns to his
job amidst sighs of relief. Field Fisher, in
the waiter part, revives memories of a long-
forgotten musical comedy by looking rather
like the Gazeka.

“Within the Law,” played by the same co.
(in most respects) that introduced it to
the city last year, is having another popu-
lar revival at Melbourne Royal. A different
baffled lawyer receives his quietus from the
patent noiseless firearm; but Muriel Stan-,
Mary Worth, Maxon Morrison, Plumer,
Sweeney and Wykeham, the dry-goods
magnate, are back in their old places.
Also the mounting of the play is
just as careful, and the moral tone
of it is as pernicious as before. “Makes
a get-away” continues to be the American
abbreviation of the word “escapes,” and
Aggie, the transparent take-down, is still
the only apparent bread-winner for the lim-
ited crook company which Mary, the heroine,
has so successfully floated.

At Melbourne King’s Louis XV. is still
lavishing huge sums on Mrs. Du Barry,
who continues to show becoming indignation
and scorn on finding that the cash has been
wrung from his Majesty’s distracted sub-
jects. This sudden thought for the down-
trodden masses in the midst of gilded dissipa-
tion shows that the lady had a humanitarian
streak in her character which the author
might have developed to the advantage of
his moral and the adornment of his tale.
In fact, Belasco missed the ’bus in writing
“Du Barry.” Instead of sentencing the lady
to a gory end, he should have further derided
History by disclosing her as a repentant
Magdalen, sowing workmen’s cottages out
of the harvest of her youthful misbehavior.
A Flossie turned benefactress would have
made an improving theme and provided wow-
sers with a respectable excuse for studying
the purple patches of her career.
“The Climax,” built for a party of four,
is providing employment for Florence Young
and company at Melbourne Auditorium this
week. Florence takes the part of a promis-
ing songstress in a dingy Bohemian menage,
wherein Bantock is her musical comforter
and guide, and Sherras is an exhausted Dago
genius wheedling tunes from a distressed
piano. Reg Roberts, the other member of
the quartette, adores Florence violently, and
makes weird efforts to hold. her for his per-
manent delectation. The piece runs to only
three brief acts, but disguises itself as a
substantial entertainment by beginning late
and adjourning for two long thinks.
Florence Young has a suitable part as the
future prima donna; Bantock as an excit-
able maestro is a sort of Teutonised Dago,
torn by Conflicting accents, and possessed by
the spirit of a windmill in his moments of
emotion; Sherras’s negative personality is
rather short of requirements for the com-
paratively colorless role of Pietro Golfanti;
and Roberts is incommoded by the pathos
in the character of John Raymond. How-
ever, the narrative is interesting, and on the
whole a comfortable little entertainment is
offered.

arrived from Sydney with some wriggly
Turkish dances and a small parcel of
clothes ; and Fields and Coco exhibit some

with the help of whitewash succeed in imi-
tating marble goddesses and other cold com-
forters.

of “The Dublin Dandy”; and Mann and
Franks attempt to satisfy an unfelt want
for miniature revue. Incidentally Dorothy
Harris’s resumption of business as the “Rag-

by the Nuts in the audience.

Half of the Note” and “When America was
Young” as star dramas, was closely studied
by the congregation.

This is the last week of Wirths’ Circus,
open-air or under cover, in the Park off St.
Kilda-road, near Melbourne, in the County
of Bourke, Victoria, the same being situated
within the purlieus of George V.’s dominions,
whereof he is King, Emperor, Commander-in-
chief and Defender of the Faith. Another fleet-
ing show for Cup Week is Joseph Blascheck,
at the Athenaeum Hall, concluding on
Saturday; and a municipal concert at the
Town Hall begins and ends on Thursday
night. Meanwhile “The Dandies,” at St.
Kilda Esplanade, have settled down to a
summer season.
SI IRRING TIME.
Our artist's nerves begin to go.
Some brisk, new-to-Australia turns are
■showing at Adelaide Tivoli, where Mclntosh,
just back from London, has introduced the
idea of half-price to soldiers in uniform. The
Ascots are two pairs of American step-
dancers. Eddie Martin dances alone, and
•contrives to illustrate varying types of char-
acter while doing it. Alvaretta, Rego and
Stoppitt seek for laughs with absurd throaty
noises and grotesque make-up. Their knock-
about work is clever, for all that. Daisy
Jerome stands out from the crowd at the
King’s. She is an artist in her line, but it
isn’t everybody who likes the line. Dan
Thomas is at this house, and Leon Morris
with the jolly ponies w p o bite their nigger.
Allen Doone, at the Royal, ended with a
different sort of play, in which an American
writer has brought together Raffles and
Sherlock Holmes, with more revolvers to the
square act than ever before were flourished.
Doone, as the hero Raffles, allowed himself
■only one song. Edna Keeley and Onslow
Edgeworth played up to him well, and Ethel
Bashford seems worth watching. “Gipsy
Love” has just come in, with Cannot and
P. Smith prodigally lavished on the same
■co. Early summer helps the Dandies at the
Exhibition, and the picture-shows find war
■and racing at least as effective as “drama.”
A wiser drunk than the Turk, would have
kept carefully out of the present disturb-
ance. An old prophecy says that, inasmuch
as it was the last Greek emperor named
■Constantine who lost Constantinople, it
will be the first Greek king named Con-
stantine who will recover it. Now there
is a Greek king named Constantine, and
it was up to the Turk to lie low on the
weather bow till the storm of prophecy blew
•over. Instead, being intoxicated by the
exuberance and verbosity of his own fez, he
proposes to attack Russia, Egypt and India,
and unless he backs out quickly his blood
and his sherbet and his harem and all his
■other sins will be upon his own head.

Rev. M. W. Green, who passed over
recently at Cheltenham (Vic.), was well
known in Maoriland politics in the early
80’s of last century. In 1882 he climbed
into the M.L. House of Reps, as member for
Dunedin East, after a sensational scrap with
another parson, the Rev. Upton Davis, whom
lie beat by seven votes. Three years later
f Green met his Waterloo, his opponent being
Robert Stout, now M.L.’s Chief Justice.
'The just-deceased parson’s eldest son, M.
W. Green, is a person of some consequence
■on the business side of Melbourne Age.
William Cain, one of Victoria’s 10 richest
-men, died last week. He belonged to a little
■coterie that included David Syme, Simon
Fraser and William Zeal. They didn’t all
liave the same kind of investments; but
where you found one of them you could
generally find two or three. With Zeal he
was long connected with Goldsbrough,
Mort’s; with Simon Fraser he had big inter-
ests in the Squatting Investment Co. Earlier
in life he was a contractor, and built the
Melbourne Town Hall. Some jrnars later he
was mayor, and finished the building by
wadding the portico in Swanston-street.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Theorbo”: News is to hand of the death
in England of Lempriere Pringle, a native
of Tasmania but regarded as one of the
best English baritones, and much better
known on that side than on this. Melba’s
first return to Australia was for a concert
tour with Musgrove. She supplied scraps
from opera, and Pringle supported her. His
father, who was also a baritone, singing
under the name of Templeton, was a member
of Lyster’s cos., with Alice May, Clara
Thompson, Jeanie Winston, Beanmont,
Farley, Bracey, Leopold, and so forth. When
Farley left, Templeton gave acceptable imita-
tions of him. Howard Vernon’s first Melb.
appearance, by the way, was as Myles-na-
Coppaleen, in Benedict’s “Lily of Killarney,”
Templeton being Danny Mann.
But he goes to the Cup and sees the winner
romp home.
“Pirouette”: The legal dispute between
Bill Anderson and Maud Allan over Maud’s
alleged breach of contract revolved around
the limb which Maud alleged was injured
on the stage of Sydney Palace. An illum-
inating flash from defendant’s cross-examina-
tion :—■
So you went through the remainder of “The Vision
of Salome’’ on a dot and carry one leg,—Yes, and
you wouldn’t notice it if I did the same thing to-
night.
And there you have the difference between
Gende’s art and Maud’s. GenCe could
never do with less than two sound legs.
Maud might manage with one good leg and a
stick, and perhaps wouldn’t wholly disgrace
herself if she had only half a leg and an
invalid’s chair.
“T. 0.1.”: From Seattle, the lumber city
up Vancouver way, comes word of the death
of Paola Giorza, at the age of 82. Giorza
came from ’Frisco to Sydney in 1871 with
Agatha States, Gecchi, Orlandini and
Susini. Giorza was the conductor of the
party. No theatre being available, the old
Masonic Hall in York-street was secured
for Opera de Camera. On the conclusion of
the season Mrs. States gave concerts at the
Exhibition Building in Prince Alfred Park,
with Giorza as conductor and accompanist,
and Parker as organist; after which he
settled in Sydney, and was organist at St.
Pat’s Church for some years.
“Sam” Thompson, a band conductor of
some tonnage, has been promoted to a golden
harp at the age of 63. Originally a bands-
man in the 63rd Regiment, with which he
served in India, Thompson made a name for
himself as the composer of a number of
marches. In Sydney he was bugle-
major for the 3rd Regiment band 30 years
ago, and since then has made his crust out of
music in various parts of N. S. Wales.
Unie Russell-Chia, now in the Cold Coun-
try, writes to Melbourne friends to say that
she was to have returned to the stage and
toured the provinces in “The Rosary,” when
the Kaiser intervened and the tour was
abandoned.
Germany has paid—indirectly—its first
indemnity to Russia. A foolish. London
paper charged Mark Hambourg with being
a German, and that infuriated and musical
Muscovite recovered £5OO damages.
“Kaniva”: Lewis Waller has dropped
being a beauty actor —at any rate tempo-
rarily—and in “The Other Side of Love,”
which he presented at Birmingham (Eng.)
recently, he figures as a strong, silent,
“Colonial” millionaire. The critics, credit
him with having made a good job of it. The
only members of his Australian co. that, he
still has with him are Frank Woolfe, his
producer, Reginald Dane and his son
Edmund, more generally known as “Toddy.”
Madge Titheradge is playing with Cyril
Maude.
“Masetto”: The Anglican Church, having
a good billet open, has given Australia
another bump. St. Paul’s Cathedral (Melb.),
after advertising locally for an organist and
choirmaster, has decided to import one Floyd
from England. Floyd comes with a repu-
tation as a carpenter of anthems and hymn
tunes; yet, granted that he has plenty of
backing from English musical opinion, surely
some Australian organist was good enough
for the job. even if he never hammered
together a chant in his life. When the late
holder of the post, Ernest Wood, passed over,
great stress was laid on the fact that his
20-odd years’ service had seen organ-playing
lifted to almost sublime heights in Melbourne ;
but apparently all that was guff. The new
man will make a start at the end of the
year.
“Cuthbert I. O. U. Whoop”: I fear that
it is now too late to suggest to my good
friend Holman the appointment of a Minis-
ter for Fireworks and Public Rejoicings;
but I really think that, before we go in for
any more flower battles and daylight fairy-
queens, we should engage a few brass bands,
so that, when we are doing something inane
in broad daylight, the accusing voices of
conscience and commonsense may be
drowned. Last Saturday afternoon, at
Sydney Agricultural Showground, some
50,000 hot people stared in dead
silence at a grassy arena in which for long
periods nothing happened. Sometimes the
hot 50,000 stared dully at a dozen
tiny children capering to the music of an
inaudible piano. The management meant
well; but it was like feeding a superheated
elephant on a penny icecream. At other
times there was a great deal of running to
and fro, also a fair amount of impromptu
sputtering and dust-raising by motor
cyclists ; but it was a charity occasion and
nobody would have cared very much if only
there had been a continuous supply of brassy
march and ragtime. The best fancy parade
becomes malignantly dull when the only
sounds are the shuffle-shuffle of
tired feet and the howls of the hot
and red child who has just been
smacked. Those sounds would ruin
anything.
“Norbell”: The par. of “Bill Bowang”
(B. 1/10/T4), telling of the lOth-rate tour-
ing show which improvised scenery out of
bush foliage, reminds me that the late Alfred
Dampier always had real gum boughs for
his scenery when “Robbery Under Arms”
went up. Sometimes in little country halls
of one kerosene-lamp-power, the gum
Then attends the theatre.
boughs were set up for the first scene, and
stood the night—the home of the Marstons,
the Turon racecourse, the interior of Kate
Morrison’s pub, and so on, all being played
in the one gum-bough setting. Even in the
big production at H. M. Theatre, Sydney,
Dampier had the wings completely covered
with gum boughs, and, on occasion, used
to personally decorate them with sprigs of
wattle blossom. The old man took “Rob-
bery” to London and produced it at a West
End theatre in conjunction with Anna
Ruppert, the complexion expert, but it was
a failure there —probably because he
couldn’t find any gum trees in Hyde Park.
There used to be an old stage doorkeeper at
the Royal Standard (now the Little
Theatre), Sydney, who had a grievance,
real or imaginary, against Dampier. “Do
I know Dampier?” he would ejaculate. “That
smooth-tongued bushranger wid his Corro-
boree Under Ar-rms? Is ut me that knows
him? Fourteen horses on th’ stage, an’
ivery wan av thim got paid but poor Pat!
An’ the bfissid stage itsilf like a Cowyard
wid sawdust, an’ straw, an’ horse lavin’s,
an’ me constantly sprinklin’ eucalyptus on ut
to make ut smell like gum leaves!”
The “poor farmer” is again resurrected
as a Tariff scarecrow. This is from West-
ralia:—
Blacker and blacker grows the farmers’ prospects.
Slavishly responsive to the demands of the cities
and the dictation of the manufacturers’ organs, the
leader of Labor has decided to increase the Protective
tariff forthwith. Higher duties spell increased costs
both of living and production... .The farmer, the
fruit-grower and the pastoralist must be butchered in
order that the hothouse industries of the ridiculously
over-grown cities may wax fat and luxurious.
Well, consider the extent of the butchery.
(1) The farmer or grazier has to find a market for
his products. As his present market is something
over 10,000 miles away he can’t personally interview
his prospective buyers, so he employs a local agent
to deal with a city agent, who is an agent of another
agent’s agent; and every hawk of the whole flock
takes a bite out of the farmer. If the farmer had a
local market for his products, the agent, the sub-
agent and the sub-agent’s agent would be practically
all eliminated.
(2) Owing to his raw products having to be
dragged half-way round the globe before they can be
sold, items of freight and insurance and exchange
are introduced to the bill.
(3) The producer has no alternative but to accept
the prices the foreign market may decide he shall
get. If, on the other hand, he could sell his pro-
ducts locally, the price he would get would be fixed
by local conditions, and the price he would pay for
his boots and his beer and liis other purchases
would be controlled by precisely the same conditions.
(4) If the necessary local consumers can be
obtained in any other way than by High Protection,
this other way hasn’t been mentioned ; and until it is
mentioned it is safest to assume that it doesn’t
exist.
“B.” : . An example of the rotten state of the
probate law in N. S. Wales was given the
other clay when Justice Simpson was forced,
in Equity, to hand over about £4OOO to a
Chinese hospital, the testator having so
devised it, despite the fact that he left chil-
dren behind him. Three of the progeny
petitioned to have the will set aside ; but as
actual lunacy could not be proved, the Judge
was unable to oblige them. A Judge in
Victoria would have cut up the £4OOO among
the children; a Judge in Maoriland would
have had power to act similarly; a Judge
in N.S.W. must stick to the tcrawled words
of the dead man, however rank the conse-
quent injustice may be. Justice Simpson
said, in giving judgment, that he strongly
disapproved of the terms of the will and
would like to set it aside, but he regarded the
fact that the testator himself had written the
will as strong evidence that he knew and
approved of its contents. N.S.W. Parlia-
ment has time and again taken this question
in hand, but partly because of the obstinacy
of a few members, and generally because of
supineness, or stupidity, or congenital Tory-
ism, or all three, the “dead Land” has been
allowed to live as an agent qf post-mortem
malice and all round injustice.
Died at Campbelltown (N.S.W.), aged 79,
Mrs. Gertrude Clara Woodhouse, widow of
Edward Hume Woodhouse, of Mount Gilead
and Coonong station. Her husband’s father,
G. M. Woodhouse, came to Sydney with
Judge Advocate Elias Bent as an articled
clerk, in 1809; became Private Secretary to
Governor Macquarie ; and died in 1869. Mrs.
Woodhouse was buried, in the old R.C. Ceme-
tery at Campbelltown, where lie the remains
of Jean Ruse, of the First Fleet, who_, so the
record runs, “sowed the first grain” in Aus-
tralia.
“Billy B.”: They tell you A.L.V. stands
for Australian Lady Volunteers, but, if I’m
any judge of the uniform affected by Girl
Scouts and such like, the letters really mean
Alluring Leg Visions.
The A.M.A., Broken Hill, which practi-
cally controls the Trades Hall there, nearly
burst its boiler with indignation at the idea
that its members should have half-time work
offered it. It characteristically rushed out a
resolution to the effect that, till things
righted themselves, members should pay no
rent. Then the Check-weighers’ Union met
and decided that, as its members were on half-
time, it would honor the A.M.A. resolution by
paying no rent for the premises it occupied in
the Trades Hall. At latest, the A.M.A. was
wondering dazedly where the brick came
from, and the public, very tired of the Broken
Hill unions, wasn’t expressing any sympathy
that could be heard even with an ear-trumpet.

His coat was green, his chin was blue,
His hat proclaimed its age,

In England tlie war fever has so far pro-
gressed that barristers who are in the Terri-
torial service are now allowed to address his
’Onali or his Washup in uniform. It is a
good advertisement for the barrister, and
should cause a rush of enlistment. When
the legal gentleman in the cocked hat and
feathers and spurs carefully lays his swnrd
on the table and says that he appears for
the drunk, and the one in plain clothes
appears against the drunk, said drunk ought
to get off without a beer-stain or a fragment
of counter-lunch on his character.
R. W. Hill, who once practised in the
Auckland Supreme Court, escaped from
Wellington mental asylum IS months ago, and
has now returned to Auckland to ask the
animal with the long ears what it thinks of
itself. As a beginning, he moved to have the
magistrate’s reception order quashed; then
he hurried to the Supreme Court, and asked
it to interpret certain provisions of the Men-
tal Defectives Act, and to decide whether the
fact that he had retained his liberty for three
months was not tantamount in law to a
declaration that he was sufficiently sane to
manage his own affairs. When ho was first
committed to the asylum, Hill endeavored to
gain his freedom by the usual application.
Auckland authorities, it is said, considered
him sane; but suddenly he was transferred
to the southern institution, and Auckland had
no further say in the matter. Hill, there-
fore, decided ‘to escape, and succeeded in
getting to Sydney, where he joined the Seamen s
Union, so that lie might move on hurriedly
if the Maoriland authorities gave chase. No
attempt at recapture having been made dur-
ing the following three months, he sought to
regain possession of his property, but failed ;
so he settled down to work in Sydney, and
for 12 months exhaustively studied the Maori-
land lunacy laws, and then returned to Auck-
land to throw in his carefully-prepared little
bomb. # #
When a man writes to a paper to say that
another man didn’t do something—for in-
stance, to defend him violently against an
alleged charge of bigamy or parricide or in-
curable intoxication—he is laying up trouble
either‘for himself or the paper. Ex-Premier
Watt, of Victoria, was presented with a por-
trait of himself when he quitted State for
Federal politics, and a misguided admirer or
hostile friend or ill-directed enemy wrote to
the Age saying it was quite untrue that
Watt had himself put up most of the price of
the article. The Age published this stren-
uous defence, and the jury said that its
brilliant act of kindness was worth iIOUU

“0.K.” : How lovely is the indignation of
Professor Schuster at being suspected of
treachery because he had a powerful wire-
less plant at his quiet country residence in
England! The Government order for all
private wireless installations to be pulled
down, or given over to the military authori-
ties, was issued nearly three months ago;
yet this Schuster had continued to swap
messasrps with friends in Europe. His in-
dignation, his thirst for scientific
knowledge, and the fact that his
brother is an English bank mag-
nate and a member of the Council
of India, can be taken at their
worth. If other Teutonic mem-
bers of the British Royal Socsdy
had shown any anti-Kaiser feeling
when the war broke out these
things might have carried weight,
and common sense might have lis-
tened to Schuster’s excuses for
defying the Government order.
But other learned German gentle-
men are not, as a rule, opposed
to the Kaiser’s methods of diffusing
German “culture.” The recent
Australian visit of certain peace-
ful-looking scientists was an as-
tounding revelation. Happening
to be here when war began, they
told us quite freely that they could
see nothing but “unwarrantable
animosity” in Britain’s attitude to
the German movement against Bel-
gium, nor anything but meanness
in Belgium’s refusal to let the
Kaiser’s troops march unmolested
into France. Any attempt to con-
vince them that the Kaiser’s mili-
tary policy needed thwarting made
them- merely angry. Schuster is
not to be judged, certainly, by the
attitude and behavior of anybody
else; yet the typical German pro-
fessorial attitude can fairly be taken into
account in estimating what any professor
of German origin would be likely to do. If
Schuster didn’t make improper use of his
illicit plant, he was, in these circumstances,
an amazing fool to maintain one on his
premises.
“N or M” : The mainland has no mono-
poly of this drought. It is hitting Tasmania
in a way this green island is not accustomed
to. Most of the big Australian spells of dry
horror pass us over. That of the ’9o’s was
actually an asset to this State; but the
present one is a bit of bad business. In
some parts there has not been rain enough
to wet the subsoil for a couple of years, and
all branches of farming are suffering severely.
A number of the people on Tasman’s Penin-
sula (to name one place that is getting it
badly) are being forced to abandon their
holdings. Forty years ago there was as dry
a patch on the calendar, but for later
arrivals this is the record.

“R. 8.” on another of the sins of William:
Champagne of the 1915-16 mintages will be made
scarce by the pressure of war; and much of the
vintages from 1908 will be lost by pillage and
wanton destruction. Eighty miles west of Paris is
the champagne centre —Epernay and Ay, and beuind
it the forest of Rheims, the White Hill of Cramant,
and Bouzy and Verzenay, the vineyards of the moun-
tain. Ay produces the finest grapes because there is
a thin layer of soil, and below it a chalk bed, so
that the sunheat and the rains sink but a foot 01
so, and the water oozes to the foothills. The
wine of Bouzy is more full-blooded. In Verzenay
are little vineyards of SilJery, whose owner, Mumm,
has been arrested for letting his tongue loose. Bouzy
produces a red champagne which won’t travel an
exquisite wine that makes those who drink it throw
kisses at the memory thereof. But none of the
finished wires are true to vineyard. Sillery is
married to Ay, and Ay to Bouzy, and Ay to Verzenay.
The blender is greater than the grower; there are
17,000 proprietors to 30,000 acres, and the blenders
buy the grapes on the vines. If this has been a
hot summer in Champagne the vintage commenced at
the end of September; if it were cool, picking could
not begin till the middle of October, in which case
it was imperfectly done at best. The sherries of
Spain are still trampled out by the feet of men ; in
Champagne the grapes are pressed by a screw. There
is nothing picturesque in the vintage ; there are no
processions, and the “merry villagers” sing the songs
of Paris when they sing at all. But if its pictur-
esqueness is lost a modern care of the. workers has
replaced it. How old the business is no man knows.
There was a canon of Rheims a thousand years ago
who wrote of “the wine not of the valley nor of
the hilltops, but of the mountain sides,” and much
later the vignerons implored the cathedral chapter
of Rheims to warn “these insects” (the phylloxera)
to leave Champagne alone. The Church gave the
insects six days’ notice to retire. I don’t know what
happened ; but nearly 400 years afterwards —in 1893
—it was said there never had been a better brew.

The other evening a private motor conveyed
to the Melbourne Hospital a suburban citizen
with a cavernous gash in his throat. The
victim and his wife were led to the casualty
room and their chauffeur departed. After
the orifice had been sewn up the visitors were
asked for explanations. They, declined to
explain anything, and went on declining. And
apparently they were within their rights. Yet
it does not seem altogether right. Attempted
murder and suicide being both indictable
offences, it is logically as absurd that a man
should be allowed to carry about with him an
unexplained gash in the throat, as that he
should be suffered to dash from a jeweller’s
shop Carrying a handful of watches.
While the war lasts, military commandants
in .Australia may issue orders for the seizure
“in any building, vessel or place" of articles
and documents likely to be used to the pre-
judice of the Commonwealth. Now there
exists, ar.d has long existed in N.S.V., a
law against the use of a “place’ for certain
gambling purposes. For years and years
Judges, barristers, solicitors, articled clerks
and legal sundries have tried to define a
“place.” And despite much expense they
dpvr struck the simple idea that a place is
anywhere above ground or underground, or
in the air, or on the sea, or under the sea, or
anything or anybody; in fact, that unless the
defendant could prove that he was nowhere,
and could show how he got there, and how lie
came away from there, the argument should
cease. If the military authorities settle this
vexed point and define a “place” in high-
handed military fashion the war won’t be all
loss.

“Geranium Bill” : Whenever I see a subur-
banite of generous waist measurement sitting,
all swollen up with pride, behind a bouquet of
his own. growing, I feel sorry that the good
old days when potentates wore garlands and
carried bouquets have gone for ever. In
these dull times the fat man who grows roses
of surpassing beauty can at most wear one
or two blooms in his buttonhole; the rest of
the garden has to be left to his womenfolk.
The historian gravely records: "Right up to
the 17th century members of Parliament,
magistrates and university magnates attended
public ceremonies crowned with garlands and
bearing bouquets in their hands.” It makes
one grieve to think whnt a lot of fine symbol-
ism has been lost by the abandonment of the
old custom. Imagine the classic-featured
Peake, of South Aus., rising to make his
financial statement with a wreath of thistles
over one ear and a bunch of wild thyme in
his hand !
“North Q.” : How about sand-bagging the
traditional “Little Boy from Manly” on the
figurehead of Australia? He is out-of-date,
and, anyhow, he never was Australian. He
is either German or Dutch. On one recent
page there were 21 of him. Jessup being
responsible for the |, and Brown and
“Cypher” for one each. In a more recent
issue, Vincent and Low exploited him again.
Let us, instead of this impostor in fancy
dress, have something like Norman Lindsay’s
“Young Australia” in the regulation uniform
of the cadet. The other is a flagrant importa-
tion, and as such unworthy the attention of a
national-minded people.
THE CANNIBAL’S VIEWPOINT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a great deal too much nonsense talked
about cannibals. The cannibal eats man for verv
good reasons, and he doesn’t kill except for good
beef-steak reasons. If I were to tell my cannibals in
Africa about what is going on in Europe, i>OOO dead
among the Allies, 7000 dead among the Germans,
they would exclaim” H ere be broke into a
string of voluble native dialect, translating it as,
“Oil the venomous hatred of the snake! I hey kill,
and they do not eat what they have killed .
(Laughter.) —Missionary Crawford's utterances in
K. M. Herald.
The heathen In his nudenrss
Is a man not wholly blind ;
He has sympathetic feelings
In his dark and simple mind ;
Rut he keeps his own set notions
Of the things he likes to cat,
And to him our war’s unlawful,
Senseless, hateful, truly awful—
Makes him boil with indignation
At the shameful waste of meat!
He’s an economic person
Who abhors the thought of waste ;
If he chanced to slay a foeman
He would show no foolish haste
To continue with the slaughter—
For mere killing has no thirst.
There’s Reason in his slaying,
And his hand would he be staying
Ere he worked some new destruction —
He would eat the slaughtered first!
If in Europe he was fighting,
From mere hate would war be clean;
There would just be little battles
With a lunch-time in between.
Though his ultimate objective
Might be Kaiser as his meat,
He would not waste Hans or Otto,
For “Be careful” is his motto,
And he squirms with pious horror
At the waste of things to eat.

“D.” attends two funerals: —
The war has killed the Empire Day movement so
dead that the public has almost forgotten that the
rather absurd affair ever existed. The same with
Orangeism. Institutions like these inevitably lan-
guish when the Nation’s life is at stake, because they
are based on fallacies, and people have no time for
play-acting when peril on a large scale is around.
The fallacy which supported the Empire Day move-
ment was the assumption that those who considered
the public bellowing of songs like “Sons of the Sea”
to be ridiculous and superfluous were “disloyalists.”
Corybantic patriotism appeals to some people, and
those are the sort that used to join Empire leagues.
To others—equally averse from seeing the Empire
dismembered—such displays are painful. A man
cannot demonstrate his approval of the Empire more
effectively than by offering to lay down his life for
it, if need be. To put it with moderation, as many
Eaborites (whom the Empire Day orators were in
the habit of terming “disloyalists”) have volunteered
for the front as Liberals. The professional “Imperi-
alists” are thus left without any subject for com-
plaint. And once an essentially Pharisaical move-
ment of this sort is deprived of the opportunity to
point out how much more virtuous it is than others,
it is done.
Orangeism is in much the same awkward position.
The deplorable little parsons who keep the disturb-
ance alive are no longer in a position to snuffle about
the unworthiness of the Irish. Seven Irish regiments
are fighting in France and Belgium at the present
moment, and fighting well. The popular tabernacle
gag about the incompetence and degeneration of
persons professing the R.C. faith is rebutted by the
case of Belgium—the extremely efficient little country
which has put up a fight for liberty for which history
has no parallel. The Empire’s chief enemy is the
world’s most Protestant sovereign. Its present allies
in Europe are Orthodox Greek Russia and Servia and
Romanist France and Belgium. Also Romanist Italy
looks like joining in on Britain’s side within a day
or so. The men of all these nations have shown
themselves to be worthy comrades-in-arms of the
mostly Protestant Britishers; and as regards ethics
they are, at least, no more ruthless, immoral, destruc-
tive and generally uncivilised than the soldiers of
Protestant Germany. In brief, the whole Orange
propaganda is seen to be based on an absurdity.
Five hundred years of Protestantism hasn’t civilised
the Germans'; a thousand years of Catholicism hasn’t
enervated the Belgians.
Orangeism and the Empire Day foolishness will
doubtless arise again and resume blither at the old
addresses when the war which has discredited them
is over. At present their collective name is mud.

In the great European boil-over the only
new-fangled animal of offence that has come
up to anything like expectations is the sub-
marine. He is dangerous j yi t the measure
of his .offensiveness is more or less counter-
balanced by his frailty. Once his periscope
lias gone lie is finished, and must come to
the surface and take his chance—and some
warships have shown a perfect genius for
shooting away periscopes. His chief value
lies in his ability to get on the nerves of
the other fellow. Which, by the way, recalls
the grim joke of the Teuton when he found
torpedo destroyers ramming his submarines.
He placed a periscope on a floating mine,
and as he turned it loose remarkt l cheer-
fully, “Now. you Englislier, ram that!" So
far the EngLsher has declined the invitation.

The parsons find Defence Minister Pearce

announced that, “influence having been

transport of the second expedition is to ship

there will be 40 clergy to 20shins. It will

BILLY (to tourist): “An' yer never bin in a blacks' camp before?"
TOURIST : “No. There are no such things in my country."
BILLY : “ Well, Hingland MUST be a funny place."
I “Snell”: I was at Caulfield when Uncle
Bun anlved first, and I became, with about
■lOO others, a willing listener to a little
Altercation between a stoutish, slightly-
p'eroxided, somewhat-rouged person whose
name might have been Floss. Floss was
angry because the bookmaker would not pay
her on Uncle Sam, when she had backed
some other horse, although she really meant
to back Uncle Sam. Finding anpeals use-
less, Floss said plainly: “Why, you
squasli-faced son of a , you aren’t
fit to bet with the public. You orter be
well pinched fer a low-down, dirty,
■, , , common, thief!”
Then she left. The bookmaker sighed.
“Really,” he said, “I’d much rather not do
business with ladies.”
A difficulty of the sort which confronted
King Solomon harassed N.S.W. Justice Fer-
guson in Chambers last week. Two women
disputed tearfully the legal possession of a
small girl. One was the mother, the other
the foster-mother. Four years ago the
mother, without the consent of her husband,
sighed away their infant daughter to a kind
person anxious to adopt her. Recently the
mother demanded the child’s return, and
when her request was refused, abducted her.
The foster-mother in turn re-abducted the
girl and hid her. The parents then fired in
a writ of habeas corpus. Justice Ferguson
hadn’t any legal difficulty in finding that the
habeas corpus was immediately fatal, though
he described it as a most painful duty. So
another “scrap of paper” was torn up.
The soldier and the sailor are now quite
certain that they are sole lords of earth, sea
and air—and no won-
der, when every meek
civilian poet is telling
them so at the top of
his voice. A Bulle-
tin minor bard who
had loyally done his
share of whooping
was semi-humorously
ordered off the foot-
path in Pitt-street,
Sydney, the other
afternoon, by three
cheery young blue-
jackets ; and when he
got back to his office
he ran into a khakied
hero in sours who
sternly handed him a
poem calling upon him
to ‘‘Give three ringing
cheers for our lads
who’ve gone to fight,
And pity yon white-
livered wretch who
stays at home to-
night.” That was too
much for the civilian
patriotic singer. He
gave a low wail, and,
cramming the poem
into the warrior’s
hand, rushed off in a half-demented
state and enlisted in the famous First
Hebrew Dragoon Guards. He now
fills in his spare time putting the
finishing touches to a triumphant regi-
mental chant entitled “Hail! Heroes of
Jerusalem.”

As the result of a popular outcry, the
maintenance allowed to the missus and off-
spring of the British Tommy Atkins has been
raised. When the war began Mrs. Atkins
was expected to fight her battle on anything
from 11s. Id. per week if she had no children
to 17s. Od. if she had four or more. The allow-
ance now ranges from 12s. Gd. to 225., and
apparently the lady who became Mrs. Atkins
without the sanction of the military authori-
ties, and who formerly had no claim for con-
sideration, is not now neglected. At the very
best, 225. is not dazzling affluence, but it is an
improvement. Not so long ago an old woman
in England, the wife of a soldier who had
fought in the Crimea, had 19 sons at one time
in the army. Queen Victoria got to hear
of the case, and the old lady was granted
what is known as “the Queen’s bounty.” The
Queen’s bounty amounted to 3s. 9d. per week.
“N’importe”: The Legion of Frontiersmen
has once more been passed the ixffd mutton.
The Legion may be seen individually strut-
ting round in a blue shirt, riding pants,
gauntlets, leggings, spurs calculated to dis-
embowel anything with a hide thinner than
that of a rhinoceros, saucepan cleaners on
its shoulders, a Baden-scout’s hat, and enough
odd bits of leather in the shape of cartridge
belts, etc., to stock a saddler’s shop. The
Legion looked pretty fierce in the piping
times of peace, but when the war broke out
it waxed its moustache furiously, donned its
full regimentals, and assisted at various shows
in aid of various patriotic funds. It talked
bravely of fighting for the Dear Old Flag,
and went into training on its own account.
One thing it didn’t do. It didn’t volunteer
to doff its pretty uniform and join the drab
khaki-covered men whose main idea is fight-
ing. It wanted to preserve its identity. The
local military authorities viewed the sauce-
pan cleaners with suspicion, and suggested,
if the Legion wanted to fight, it could join
some Expeditionary Force like the ordinary
person. That was the cold mutton. The cold
potatoes followed. AVhen Colonel Maritz set
out to grab a piece of the Empire for himself
in South Africa, the Legion offered the Union
Government the services of a regiment. If
the offer had been accepted it is doubtful
whether there would have been enough
leather and saucepan cleaners in Australia to
equip it. But General Smuts politely but
very firmly said “No, thanks.” It is not sug-
gested that the regiment would not have been
forthcoming if Smuts had said “Yes” but
the Legion would have been on just as safe
ground if it had offered to send an army
corps. And it might then have got a bigger
advertisement —or a larger helping of cold
spuds.

The “unwritten law” got a mild advt. at
Melbourne City Court lately. The defend-
ant admitted to “shaping up” at a man in
Collins-street, but pleaded that the
threatened party had bolted with his wife.
The Bench reminded him that the Divorce
Court was available, and immediately stulti-
fied itself by letting him off on condition that
he put a trifle in the poor box. No legisla-
tion will ever wholly kill the ancient rite of
“jobbing” the co-re. Yet, regarded as a
score, it is quite poor. In this case it would
probably have narked the lady much more
had the deserted husband passed the other
by with a happy smile and the assurance
that he was enjoying himself. The lady
could then be safely left to see that if she
was narked the co-re. was doubly narked.

THE MAID AND HER TROUSSEAU.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She sits inside and dreams and sews,
Making her everlasting trousseau ;
The mistress round the kitchen blows,
And tells her sharply not to do so.
But all in vain; the servant’s dreams
Of marriage with her swain, the “milky,”
Have deafened her to angry screams ;
.She works, unmoved, her garments silky.
Full well her mistress knows she will
Come to the washtub in due season,
When she is married to her Bill.
But what fiancee wants to reason?
So there she sews, while work goes hang,
With maiden blush that’s almost hectic ;
She hears no scream—she heeds no bang
Of mistress mad and apoplectic.
She sits apart and calmly sews;
Her mistress screams—she does not falter ;
But well her wild employer knows
Her washtub waits beyond the altar!

miners don’t line up to it as of old. I met one
Bung who swore bitterly that the late Detective
Kavanagh was as great a calamity as the war, and
that he ruined Kalgoorlie when he knocked the
stuffing out of the gold-stealing industry.
A NECESSARY REFORM.
“I think, Augustus, they ought ter give free
beer with their counter-tunch."
“Tiaki”: Recently, in Maoriland. from
Gisborne up to Cape Runaway, the whole landscape
rolled and crept like a shaken carpet, and, in conse-
quence, bricklayers, carpenters and glaziers are work-
ing overtime. There was one fatality: a man was
buried under. thousands of tons of fallen cliff. He
will be there until the Resurrection. The roar pre-
ceding a shake is a weird sound. It is like a
10,000,000-h.p. motor scorching up and down the
hills of Jerusalem. It is everywhere and nowhere.
It seems to be miles in air and in the bowels of the
earth. Then the scenery begins to whisper, gaso-
meters belch, churches bow to pubs, chimneys totter
and sometimes sway and fall, children laugh at the
antics, cattle rush around in terror and men dash
forth from their whisky sleep in pyjamas, and women
from their virtuous couches in their nighties. 1
don’t know anybody who has ever become used to the
earthquake feeling. Probably this is because, though
I live in the thick of it, 1 don’t know anybody who
has tried.
“Troddles": Allow me to deliver a cure
for the bite of the stinging tree. Get a tube of
bicycle solution and apply a coating over the afflicted
area, and relief is instantaneous in most cases. If
the sting is from the purple-berried variety, the
solution should be left until the. torture ceases. If
the curative article isn’t included- in the camp menu
the native rubber-tree or fig- provides one equally
good. This tree is easily distinguished by its pro-
pensity to sponge on its neighbors, clinging to the
trunks and throwing out long feelers, which eventu-
ally (if they get far enough) root in the earth. On
severing these feelers you release a creamy, viscous
fluid, which is just as effective a cure as its canned
relative.

“Goody”: Papua was very sagely appor-
tioned amongst the several missionary bodies, so
that each would have a field to itself, but at the
village of Uaiva the London Missionary Society and
the R.G. Church overlap, with the inevitable result
of friction, the Samoan teachers of the former
body once went so far as to picket the rival station
and prevent its disciples entering;. The French
priest had to hop on to his pony and get a Resident
Magistrate to order the enemy off. The Samoan
put his case against the Popi tauna (Pope’s man)
this way: “Popi touna.he too much koi-koi (gam-
mon) allatime along New Guinea boy. He koi-koi
Guvment all-a-same. By-um-bye, ’spose New Guinea
boy he savvy talk along Popi tauna, he go down
along Devil quick feller. Popi, lie all-a-same pourri-
pourri tauna (native sorcerer). Boy he too much
fright tor him. Good feller Alaster Jesu Cheristo.
He no, friend belong Popi tauna: He no listen little
bit koi-koi talk belong Him, By-um-bye, Popi he
die finish, he go stop down inside big fire, burnein-
burncm allatime, all-a-same wood. Why for Guv-
jnent he no savvy gammon belong Popi ? He no
proper white man; he talk another kind” (t'.c., the
ILC. priests are usually French, Italian or German).
Spose he talk language belong him, you no can
savvy. More better Popi and me two feller fight
finish. I too much wild alonga him.’.’ This, by the
wav, is a fair sample of the “English” which my
Samoan friend teaches his Papuan scholars when-
ever he gets a chance.

“Te Pana”: Of all the jim-jams I have
over shaken hands with, the land-crab is the jimmi-
cst. He :«'« a horror. I saw a lot of him recently
at Ena, a flyspeck piece of coral, the property of
George of. Tonga; Prominent in this crab's make-up are
a pair of claws that rival in strength the paws of a
neolithic politician, and to hear him cleaning its
teeth reminds you of stones being shaken in a
Skull. In his working hours lie scales the cOco'palpH,
•dips °ff the nuts, and gets active with the husks,
tearing away the coarse fibre like so. much straw.
He lines his tunnel-home with tiie waste product, and
mops up the good white meat, concentrating Tfs:
oily juice in a huge lump of fat where . his tail
ought to be, but isn’t. Added to half pint of .
boiling water, seasoned in the usual manner, allowed
to cool, and served on a clean plate, you; can over-
come a reluctance for his company. But, not till
then.

Te Pana”: Jione Tonga is the intellectual
giant of the Polynesians. I have come in contact,
both professionally as a schoolmaster, and privately,
as one who is interested in the strain,
■ with light-brown brothers from Stew-
art Island 1 (ALL.) to Papeete; and,
■ after five hours at the blackboard with
•Hone as a goggle-eyed pupil, I’ve felt
less like a whisky, and soda than after
a single hour's “English” with little
Hori in Maoriland. Young Jione’s
capacity for soaking up knowledge is
something to marvel at. He's a dab
at English ; he attends the law courts
to pick up shorthand, and his mathe-
matical accuracy is an object-lesson.
In the arts and crafts lie does not ex-
actly radiate luminous waves. Still,
he can build a bungalow or shoe a
horse if the matter, is really urgent.
With the help of a few white men he
governs his own country, and he has
managed to do it without rearing a
National Debt. The Maori has had the
largest advertisement among the Poly-
nesians, but, to my way of thinking,
this is due only to his press agent.
Henare has had opportunities, cash
and clothing showered on him, material
things that have been denied my pet
fancy: yet, starting from scratch, the Tongan would
leave him stranded in the matter of brains.
“Moana”: Apropos the remarks by
“Lagani-Namo” (B. 1 /10/’l4) about the custom that
once existed in Papua of supplying visitors with a
lady companion, it is not so many years back that
bachelor wool kings in the wild baekblocks of the
North Island of Maoriland were similarly attentive.
When a gentleman arrived on a visit they sent
to the adjoining pah and borrowed a Maori maiden
to keep the stranger from feeling conspicuously alone.
For many years this was one of the recognised forms
of hospitality. The first real howl against the prac-
tice arose when an absent-minded but extremely hos-
pitable citizen put up a wandering bishop for the
night. After that the sermons preached about the
awful iniquity of the baekblocks caused a terrible
slump in the demand for brown girl. Gratitude is
sadly wanting in some bishops.
ABSURD ON THE FACE OF IT.
SMITH: “ You say you have just come out of gaol. Was that your first offence!”
OPELESS BILL: “Do you mean that question, sir."
SMITHh: “Why, certainly. Slop trifling and answer me.”
OPELESS BILL : “’Souse me, boss, but I can’t gel over yer taking my appearance forme
debut. Honest, now, do I look like er debularul?”
“Grenada”: The pilot fish and the sucker
fish are two distinct marine inhabitants concerning
whom abo-wranglers are somewhat mixed. The former
fish generally attains a length of 12in., and is marked
by blue and white vertical bands. He is rarely seen
by himself. If you spot a" shark you may, perhaps
observe no pilot fish ; but if you see the pilot the
shark is somewhere close by. He is edible, if you
can catch him, but, as a rule, you can't- The sucker
fish is so completely different that only a Manly
Beach sailor could confuse the two. He is of a
dark color, has no scales, but resembles an eel, or
perhaps a catfish. He has a head rather like that
of a catfish, and I am inclined to believe lie belongs
to that family. His sucker plate does not extend
for two-thirds of his. length, as one writer stated. It

merely occupies the top of his head. The plate is
flat and oval, and covered with transverse corruga-
tions. I have seen them 2in. in length, sticking to
the blades of a patent log. Also, I have seen them
caught off the jetty at Byron Bay, by a piece of
bright tin on the end of a line. Those were gener-
ally 9in. in length. In North Coast (N.S.W.) rivers
specimens have been obtained as much as 13 and
14 inches long.
“Gazer”: All this talk about the deca-
dence of cannibalism makes me fatigued. The cult is
rampant in Melbourne. I prove it by a casual adver-
tisement in an unashamed local newspaper:—

“L.N.” : No front-bar patron values beer as
highly as the inland people of Papua do salt, or
sea water. They will cheerfully hump a 501 b. load
all day, over difficult country, for a couple of
tablespoonfuls of salt. Whilst wandering along the
main range, at an altitude of 6000 ft., I met a crowd
of Ilagari people carrying bottles, old tins and
long bamboos filled with sea water, which they had
brought all the way from Port Moresby, seven days’
distance. As for fresh water, though never a day
passes up in those mountains without a downpour
of rain, the country is so steep. that the moisture
runs away as fast as it falls, and women have to
descend sometimes thousands of feet
to get sufficient water to till their
bamboos. These are cut in Bft.
lengths, the pith partitions knocked
through, and a stopper of leaves in-
serted in neck. Four or five are
hitched to a woman's back, and away
■she strolls with her load. Her hus-
band assists by ejaculating “Hit urp” or “Gee over”
at frequent intervals.

Encouraged her to brood?
He strutted and he crew,
And gave her all the food
He didn’t want himself. . . .and preened his tail. ...
And yet ye offer broody hens for sale!
What of the other hens
Who peeked her jealously—
The envy of the pens,
Because she’d broody be ?
Was it for them ye tore from grass and kale
The broody hens to offer them for sale?
All her good work forgot!
For months five eggs a Week

Let incubators speak!).
Then robbed of ev’ry right, by lawn arid dale,
And shamed in public (“Broody hens for sale”).

That happy liens might see
The prizes that may come?
Oh, in these days of war, get ye to gaol
Who kill all trust with “broody hens for sale”!

LOGICAL DYSPEPSIA TREATMENT.
IMPORTANCE OF ELIMINATING
ACIDITY AND FOOD FERMENTATION.
During tlie past two or three years reports
have frequently appeared in the press con-
cerning the remarkable value of bisiirated
magnesia as an antacid; and its ability to
promote normal, healthy digestion by pre-
venting food fermentation and neutialising
dangerous stomach acid has often been
demonstrated. Until recently chemists could
supplv bisurated magnesia i- powder form
only, half a teaspoonful of which, taken in
a little water after meals, almost instantly
stops all fermentation and neutralises acid,
but sufferers from stomach trouble will be
olad to learn that, after a long series of
experiments, a leading firm of manufactin-
ins chemists has now succeeded in producing
a 5-grain mint-flavored tablet and also an
effervescent tablet, both of which combine
all the valuable antacid properties of the
ordinary bisiirated magnesia in a very con-
venient' form. These new tablets of
bisiirated magnesia can now lie obtained of
chemists everywhere, and many physicians
are already prescribing them instead ot tlie
powder form.*

A new profession has arisen in Maoriland
—that of trapping imported small birds and selling
the heads to the county councils that are spending
money in an attempt to wipe out the pests. Laige
spring nets are used, and many of the trappers make
good money. In the Ashburton county recently one
energetic individual secured 6052 heads in two
Weeks, which brought him in £lB 18s. 3d. for a
fortnight's toil. Last year, between April and Sep-
tember, the Ashburton county alone paid for 131,000
heads. And even then it is not sure that it got the
head of the fool who inmorted the first of the pests,
and so started the insanity.
“Laguni Namo”: At Fouapi, Kusai and
another island in the Carolines, a few hundred miles
up beyond what was German Papua, there
are huge ruins hidden under scrub —ruins which no
one knows more about to-day than the Spanish navi-
gators knew nearly four centuries ago. They are
of the same Brobdingnagian type as the Pyra-
mids of Old Thebes, and the huge monoliths
of remote Easter Island. At Kusai Island there is
a system of stone-sided canals, ramifying into the
interior, the walls of which are occasionally loft,
high and 6ft. thick. Following up one such silted
waterway one comes to a wall 20ft. high, hidden
under a tangle of tropic scrub. It is about 300 ft.
long and 20ft. through at any point 6ft. up from
the base. A banquette 10ft. high extends right
around inside, and the wall above is some 10 t.
thick. Inside there is another oblong citadel with
walls 20ft. x 10ft., and at one end of this is a
raised masonry dais 45ft. square, with a covered
vault 6ft. deep let in immediately in front. Noith,
south and east, between the inner and outer walls,
are other elevated platforms with vaults. Ihe
masonry consists of massive hexagonal basaltic
prisms, laid in transverse rows, without cement.
At Po’uapi these stones were quarried locally; but
as some of them are ,25ft. long and Bft. around,
and as they had to be carried over awkward country,
whoever was responsible for the work would be
looked upon with great respect by the Institute of
Civil Engineers to-day.

The secretary of the S. Aus. Society lor
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals wrote to the
Adelaide papers lately supplying a handy and pain-
less method of killing horses or other stock when
necessary. On which a farmer m the drought-
stricken West wrote in reply that the information was
badly timed. “What we want to learn is how to
keep them Alive.” He finds himself applauded ior
an epigram; but he was talking just the plain
pathetic truth. The mid-October rains which east-
ern papers said had “saved South Australia the
West Coast and most other dry parts of the State
quite untouched.

“Te Pana”: It seems to me that there’s
too much enthusiasm about tropical life. Particu-
larly is this the case when writers elaborate about
the tucker growing by the wayside in the Islands.
In my judgment, yams as white men’s kai-kai are the
limit, and a ton of the stodgy, grey mass that
Tama’si garnishes the table with, and labels bread
fruit, is only equal t.o a basketful of its wheaten
namesake. The mummy apple is an insipid affair,
and only starvation would make me sup on taro
root. As for drinks, the tipple in the young cocoa-
nuts is good enough when there is nothing bettei
offering. Kava, the wine of the Eastern Pacific, is
nauseating, and square-face has long since beaten it
on its home ground. Outside of bananas, pineapples
and oranges, there is little home-grown foodstuff in
the Islands that appeals to the white who is keeping
white.
“Lagani Namo” : Apropos, this kava con-
troversy. Sir William Maegregor, erstwhile Chief
Medical Officer of Fiji, and for 10 years Governor of
Papua, says: “It [kava] is by far the most successful
beverage that lias come under my observation, in
enabling men to give up intoxicants. Instead of
encouraging the mistaken zeal that tries to make it
a blue-ribbon matter, I would earnestly, so long as
mankind is man, urge the introduction of kava. I
should look on its introduction to this country
[Great Britain] as a yreat blessing.” All I wish to
add is that this energetic and observant Scot had the
habit of considering any matter exhaustively befoie
giving his opinion on it.
WITH THE COLORS.

“My son’s away!” the old man raved,
“lie’s with the colors at the front !”
The good bar-patriots cheered and waved
For one who’d borne the battle’s brunt.
They crowded round the aged man,
And asked him boldly what he’d take,
And cash and liquor both began
To flow for his young hero’s sake.
“What front’s he at?” they loudly cried.
“What colors is he fighting for?”
“lie’s got a job”—the old man sighed—
“lie’s paintin’ this ’ere pub’s front door!”

MULCAHY , Tasmanian politician.
The Sydney brewery Tooths have suffered
keenly in the war. Lucas Tooth’s second
son. a captain, was killed in action a few
weeks ago; now the eldest son and heir to
the baronetcy, Captain Selwyn Tooth, has
died from wounds. He leaves a widow and
a daughter five years old. The present heir
—the third and last son—is a member of
an artillery company which does home-
garrison duty in war time.
Dead in South Africa, at 38, Sinclair
Blue, the well-known huntsman and bush-
man of South Aus., and eldest son of Chief
Justice Way’s late wife. lie went to the
Boer disturbance twice—once with the sec-
ond S.A. contingent and again with the
fifth —and came away unharmed; but on
the present visit, merely on business, he was
dead of pneumonia within three months
Harry Davies, of Ballarat, who died in
Melbourne the other day, was one of the
best known of business men of the old gold-
fields city. His firm conducted one of the
most expansive softgoods enterprises outside
Melbourne. A daughter of “Big Harry”
married a son of his keenest rival, John
Snow, so that both firms were interested in
the Sydney house of Snows, which “the
youngsters” conducted. Davies was a
native, born 64 years ago at Oastlemaine.
THE PERPETUAL FEAST.
The Railway Department has not got trucks or
locomotives for starving stock, and it has not got
them for fat stock. Whether it has them for any
kind of traffic, if they were asked for with a sem-
blance of hurry, is doubtful. There never was a
department so practised in repetition of the phrase
We Cannot, and in its bright lexicon the keyword at
the top of every page is fail. —Sydney Sun.
CAW: "Do you think this state of things will
last much longer?”
CUSS: "Oh, yes! As long as all the lints
lead only to Sydney.”
“T. 0.1.”: Apropos the arrival of the
54th Melbourne Cup. The winner of
Ihe first two, Ettie de Mestre, the
Australian son of an American merchant
who settled in Australia nearly 100 years
ago, is still living at Moss Yale (N.S.W.),
comfortably awaiting the roll-call. The
horse was Archer. lie also won the 7th
Cup with Tim Whiffler (1567), the 18th
(1878) with Galamia, and he trained James
White’s Chester, who won the prize in 1877.
Tutangi, an ancient Maori with a good
pile of this world’s goods, who handed in a
big donation to the Patriotic Fund the other
day, was a Ilau Hau, and as a youth fought
against Von Tempsky, of the Forest
Hangers. He and another native fired
simultaneously at the dare-devil major, and
it was one of the two who shot him, although
only the Recording Angel knows which one
it was. Tutangi, who was a famous scout
and a great fighter, used to boast about the
slaying of Von Tempsky. But lie isn’t
proud of it now. Time has changed his
mind.
That William the Cursed is a sleeping
partner in Krupp’s is a well-known “secret.”
When Bismarck decided on smashing
France he needed formidable artillery,
which none but Krupp could supply, and
then only by an immense outlay on new
plant and buildings. Krupp had not the
capital, so William of Prussia put £BOO,OOO
into the business. It was a g iod bargain for
both monarch and subject. As one conse-
quence of the war the Krupp factory became
the most famous in the world, and the
Emperor saw his £SOO,OOO treble in value
within about 10 years.
Robert Homburg—son of the late Judge—
announces his intention to give up, at the
first opportunity, his comfortable seat for
the Burra in the S.A. Assembly. Politics
have been unusually kind to him, for he lias
been elected twice, never defeated, and is
still one of the youngest men in Parliament.
However, his elder brother and partner,
Hermann, is State Attorney-General, with
no immediate prospect of being turned out;
and the junior reckons that one of them
will have to stick to the office where Costs
come up the stairs clothed in foolscap, with
red-tape trimmings.
T A. Dibbs, general manager of the
Commercial Bank of Sydney, finished his
82nd year on Saturday. He was born in
George-street, within 100 yards of the bank
of which he has been general manager tor
no less than 47 years.
On July 31. 1883, three young men. Aus-
tralian students, were called to the A.S.W.
Bar They were Alexander Gordon, jun.,
Frederick William Gibson and Walter
Edmunds. The first is now Divorce Court
Judge; the second .served as a District Corn t
Judge for 22 years, and was buried a week
ago; the third is second judge of the Arbi-
tration Court.
The price of printing paper has been skied
in Melbourne, and publications that have
held that Australia is too poor to make its
own sausage-wraps are preparing for a night
from their old belief. One journal which
also believed that Australia can’t make print-
ing ink, used to buy its simple mixture ot oil
and lamp-black from Germany. The-way it
cursed Freetrade when supplies stopped was
enough to make a Protectionist weep for joy.
Lawyers are still the most numerous class
in the Federal Parliament, there being 14 of
them in the two Houses. A dozen members
describe themselves as journalists, but the
names of most even of those who profess to
believe in unionism are missing from the roll
of the Australian Journalists’ Association.
Farmers of one sort and another number 10,
and include Joe Cook, who, in the last Par-
liament reckoned he was a journalist. Four
men—Andrew Fisher, Speaker McDonald,
Anstey and Jim Page—state that they have
no business apart from politics. W. E. John-
son accuses himself of being an “artist”;
Kink O’Malley alleges that he is a “laborer” ;
“Motali” Kelly proclaims that he is “inde-
pendent” ; and Bigjohn Forrest and 11.
Gregory confess to being “gentlemen.”
Gone to the next camp, Frederick Bick-
uell, whose late address was Oamaru (M.L.).
As a young man he left England for Mel-
bourne in 1840, and was one of the first
people employed by the Government to ex-
periment on Black Brother’s capacity for
absorbing culture. While he held that job
he arranged a rather famous corroboree for
the entertainment of Polar explorer Sir John
Franklin, Lady Franklin and other pere-
grinating notables. Bicknell had a varied
career in Vic.’s public service before taking
up land on the Goulburn River. Subse-
quently he migrated to Maoriland, had a
brief and profitless spell at gold mining, and
then settled down in the Postal Department.
He was 95 when his time came.
Leyton Richards, the ex-Collins-street
parson who spent some of his last hours in
Melbourne in denouncing The Bulletin
for its part in imposing Defence training
upon Australia, arrive)} in London in nice
time to see Belgium—a country whose
neutrality had been guaranteed—over-run
and turned into a shambles and a ruin.
Still, Richards stuck to his hot-air guns,
more or less, and declared that, “since war
is the crime of Cain multiplied a million-
fold, no conceivable exigencies can ever, from
the Christian standpoint, condone or excuse
it.” Finally, he appealed to kings—who
didn’t happen to be present. The first one
who would do without an army and navy
would, he said, “strike a blow for liberty
and the kingdom of Heaven on earth.” It
is understood that the Kaiser cordially
approves of this noble sentiment. Its
acceptance by the Czar, for instance, would
have saved him an awful lot of bother.
THE WIN AND THE WINNER.
WHO wouldn't be a press photographer?
J. T. Lawler, of Sydney, who died during
the week in his 69th year, was in 1870 a
member of the expedition which built the
overland telegraph line from Adelaide to
Port Darwin. He was in charge of the
teams. Coming to Sydney he made some
comfortable deals in real estate, and was
one of those who helped to push the Inter-
colonial Investment Co. to its present
affluence.
From “The Oldest Inhabitant”
The Victorian Parliamentary refreshment-room
encounter between the late J. D. Wood and £ £
Smith (B. 29/10/’l4) was a very one-sided affair:
£ £ did all the assaulting. Wood did have
a serious encounter, though, with C. E. Jones, the
political tailor who was editing a Melbourne suburban
paper in which he libelled Wood and a son of R. D.
Ireland. The pair, armed with a couple of heavy
horsewhips, repaired to Fitzroy and got admission to
Jones’s house, and in the parlor the pair walloped
the tailor to their heart’s content. Police-court pro-
ceedings ensued, and a fine of £lO each was recorded,
Wood gave his cheque for the £2O, and soon after
left for England.
McCRACKEN, Brewer and Vice-President
of the V.R.C., Melbourne.
James Reading Fairfax —the “Mr.
James” of the old days of the S. M. Herald
—completed his 80th year on October 17.
He was born at Leamington, Warwickshire,
where his father had been a printer awd
bookseller, and publisher and proprietor of
The Leamington Spa Chronicle. Coming
to Sydney in 1838 John Fairfax wa>l
appointed librarian to the Australian Sub-
scription Library (1839-41). On October 7,
1840, he started a four-page sheet, The
Temperance Advocate and Australian
Commercial and Agricultural Intelli-
gence. This was printed bv James Read-
ing, his brother-in-law, who had an office in
King-street. On January 8, 1842, this was
succeeded by The Teetotaller and General
Newspaper, of four pages. In its S9th
number (September 27, 1843) the editor
was forced to write: “With this number we
close our labors, at least for the present.
Like its predecessor and harbinger, the
Teetotaller has been in a pecuniary point
of view a losing concern.” John Fairfax,
however, was not depending upon the Tee-
totaller for the family supplies. In 1840,
with Charles Kemp, who was a reporter, he
had purchased the Sydney Herald. In 1853
he bought out Mr. Kemp and became sole
owner. In 1857 the eldest son, Charles, was
taken into partnership; in 1863 he was
thrown from his horse and killed. “Mr.
James” (who had “served his time” as a
compositor) and Edward Ross Fairfax, other
sons, were taken into partnership. In 1888
“Mr. James” bought out his brother (for
£100,000, it is said), and his sons Geoffrey
E. and James Oswald were admitted to the
firm ; and that’s how it still stands. None
of the Fairfaxes have taken much interest
in politics, though John was a member of
the Legislative Council for three years
before his death.
TIME’S SATIRE.
fFoit The Rult.etix.1
Melbourne, Saturday.'—The Gazette contains a
notification approving the expenditure of £290 on
the table made of Australian materials presented to
the Palace of Peace at The Hague by the Common-
wealth Government. —Very badly-timed news item.
Peace sits still in her Palace, her white face blank
as the moon.
Crazy War on an ash-heap keeps up a horrible croon.
The Palace is still the Palace —the ash-heap once
was home.
The eyes of Peace are staring, and her lips are
flecked with foam.

THE GARTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Even now I can remember how he started when I
asked him to fasten my garter. He did it, but he
blushed.— Mrs. J. S. Erslcine, dicing personal remi-
niscences about Kitchener. (It is fair to the ladg to
add that at the time she saw Kitchener blush she was
only four years old.)
Before he grew up to be earl and field-marshal
To Eve and her wiles he was never too partial;
The glow of brown eyes didn’t turn him from glory.
His bride was Bellona, a girl very gory ;
1 : the Kiss-Me-Quick Stakes he was never a starter —
They say that he blushed at the sight of a garter.
He could map you a contour, or lay you an angle,
In a way that defied disputation and wrangle;
When he looked at those dimplesome shoulders of
Sally’s,
I’ll swear that he viewed them as hills and as val-
leys ;
All else for his engineer’s g’ift he would barter,
AS ith “a ring of revetments,” his phrase for a garter.
AS hen Tessa danced by, with her curves so ecstatic,
He’d reduce ’em to formulas pure-mathematic;
His fancies were free, and no damsel could . hobble
’em—
She was only a trigonometrical problem ;
'‘Be-entrants and salients,” he muttered, though
smarter
You never saw figure from necklace to garter.
A\ hen he gazed at Carlotta it wasn’t in flattery;
lie was only selecting a mound for a battery ;
If he stared at Blue’s A r , looking straight at the
middle,
Of the arc and the chord he was solving the riddle;
Had he strolled in a lane with the Dairyman’s Darter,
He’d have said, “Pi K Squared” when she showed
him her garter.
Had he gone to a picnic (the Sunday-school bender)
AA'here something went wrong with Priscilla’s sus-
pender,
And she gave him a hint that it wouldn’t be shocking
To buckle his watchguard around her silk stocking,
He’d have known to a point, without paper or chart,
or
A pencil, the load-bearing strain of her garter.
He was wont to observe (and the habit grew
chronic)
If a girl’s greatest beauties were spheric or conic;
In his mind he’d express the attraction of sexes
As a formula bristling with y’s and with x’s.
I can’t understand how so gelid a martyr
Could ever have blushed at the sight of a garter.

Two or three years ago £OO,OOO of inner
reserves were disclosed ; and that shouldn't
have been done, and isn’t likely to have been
done, unless the management was quite
satisfied that there wasn’t a single doubtful
asset which called for writing down. Hence
the announcement of these transfers from
inner to visible reserves was most comfort-
ing then, and is still more comforting now.
For it meant, first, that the visible reserves,
were real (that is to say, the capital was
intact and there was the amount of the
reserves to the good after providing for all
liabilities) ; and, second, that, there being
no old bad debts left to get rid of, the de-
clared profits were the real thing, as far as
the management could estimate them. To
the shareholder these features are of the
utmost importance at present., for they mean
(1) that assets could shrink by over £500,000
without touching the capital, and there is
probably also an inner reserve to provide
for ordinary shrinkages and other losses.;
and (2) profits could fall away (say)
£20,000 per half-year before the present
dividends would be in danger.
For the present there is no reason to
expect a shrinkage of £500,000. Times, it
is true, are going to be pretty rocky in Aus-
tralia for a while. The National’s connec-
tion is mainly with Victoria and S. Aus.,
and both those States are hit by drought.
But, unless prospects change completely, this
year’s drought isn’t going to mean an
appalling loss of stock. It is going to com-
pletely knock out the export of wheat and
flour for 12 months ; but the failure of the
wheat crop in 1914 is more likely to mean
a bumper harvest in 1915 than otherwise,
whereas sheep and cattle losses would mean
poverty till the country was slowly stocked
up again. Thus the drought is not likely
to destroy much of our capital: nor is the
war. We shall lose a year’s wheat and flour
exports, worth (say) £9,000,000; and our
wool and metal shipments are utterly dis-
organised. Our national income for 12
months will suffer in this way to the extent
of perhaps £20,000.000. But, after all. that
isn’t anything dreadful considering that the
Commonwealth’s production is worth over
£200,000,000 a year —it was £206.732.000 in
1912. For a few months all securities are
going to bring less money. But the holder
of securities doesn’t suffer from a temporary
slump unless he has to sell them ; and there’s
no visible reason why this and other Aus-
tralian banks should have to foreclose and
sell in a wholesale way. Nothing could
bring that about but pressure for repayment
of deposits ; and Australian bank being as
strong as they are, and Australia being so
singularly unaffected by the war, why should
depositors want to pull out? There are
millions of investors in war-racked countries
who roust be envying the Australian bank
depositor his luck.
Items compare with those of the previous
year this way :

But those figures mustn’t be taken to indi-
cate what has been happening since the war
broke loose. Thus, though the National has
£694.162 more money out than it had *l2
months ago, in the past six months the
advances have actually shrunk by £41.986.
Deposits have also been lately drawn upon
pretty heavily—no doubt to fulfil commit-
ments entered into before Hell got adrift —
and liquid assets have therefore been pretty
largely drawn upon. Still there are enough
assets in liquid form to pay 36 p.c. of the
liabilities. This is a comfortable holding,
of course ; nevertheless, in the circumstances,
it means that the bank must go slow, and
it is best for customers to realise this. Ordi-
narily money would start to pour in as
the growers got their wool and wheat
cheques; but no outside money will come in
for wheat for 12 months, and not half as
much as usual will come from wool before
February next. Instead of bringing in
money, the wool and wheat growing custo-
mers will have to be financed, so. some
money must go out; and 36 p.c. isn’t a
liquid holding that gives very much of a
margin to work on.

This is the State Bank, run in competition
with the Commonwealth Bank. Formerly
most of its branch and agency business was
done by the post-office. It was, in fact, the
post-office savings bank. But when the
Federal Constitution provided for the tak-
ing-over of the post-offices, it didn’t mention
the savings bank, probably because the
framers didn't think it necessary to specify
that any more than the door-mat or the pen
you can never write with in the telegraph
office ; so, having the power and needing the
money, the States hung on. Later on it was
decided that the post-office must run a bank
for the Commonwealth which owned the
post-oflice; and then the States had to move
out. A hurried opening of branches and
agencies followed; and the exes, for 1913
jumped in consequence, and went on jumping
in the past 12 months. Per 100 transac-
tions, however, the cost last year was the
same as in the previous year. That is to
say, whereas it was formerly -18 s. 4d., in the
past two years it has been 575. Od. The
depositors pay the extra 9s. 2d. per 100
transactions for the joy of having their busi-
ness done by the State instead of by the
Commonwealth ; and as the State is only a
part of the Commonwealth, it follows that
they also get less security.
There never was a madder thing than this
duplication of public savings banks; but the
next table; showing how the funds are in-
vested, explains why the States insisted on
it:—

In 10. years the bank has increased its loans
on mortgage from £1,439,020 to £2,295,673 ;
but Government loans, which barely ex-
ceeded the mortgage loans in 1904, are now
£12,867,737. The total of deposits has grown
like this: —

1908 .. 13,428,676 1914 .. 23,381,696
1909 . . 14,101,710
In 10 years there has been a growth of
rather less than £10.000,000 of deposits ; but
the State Government has in that period,
managed to collar £11.001,000. In other
words, more money has been put into State
Government debentures during the past 10
years than has actually come in in deposits.
For all practical purposes the Savings Bank
has become ah institution for raising loans
for the State Government —without the
depositors being aware of it. Certainly a
■little< goes. in othbr things ; but it is hardly
worth mentioning.
Apart from the State Government and the
banks (which are helped along with fairly
liberal fixed deposits) the principal creditor
nowadays is the Advances Department, or
Credit Fonder. This branch was, originally
established to supply the man on the land
with cheap money, and the benefits were
confined to “the backbone of the country”
till 1910. Just about that time the back-
bone lost some of its old political pull, and
the city toiler (who, by the way, can be just
as valuable an Australian) got farther into
the limelight. Hence advances may now be
made towards paying for shops and dwellings
as well as farms. The result is that, whereas
in 1912 the bank’s loans to the Advances
Department totalled £1,311.750, they are
now £2,411,122:
Depositors, of course, needn’t lose a
moment’s sleep over their security. First,
to protect the deposits there are £530.512
pf accumulated profits-—not very much, cer-
tainly. when you think of the £23 000.000
of deposits, but a lot when you remember
that more than two-thirds of those deposits
ar,e in public securities and liquid assets.
And. as if this were not enough, behind it
stands the unlimited guarantee of the State.

The Royal of Queensland has been creeping
along very quietly. The general idea has
been that it had a good deal of old trouble
to get rid of; hence the very small amount of
profit which it has shown in excess of the
dividend. As at March, 1914, for instance,
when it again gave the shareholders a little
extra bite, all it had left to go to visible
reserves was a poor £ll9B. Lhe assumption
alwavs has been that the management was
every half-year clipping something off the
real profit and employing it to write down
overvalued assets. There is, however,
another possibility: the management may
have by this time written assets down _ to
present value, and may now be accumulating
a contingency fund —a very handy thing to
have about a bank, and especially a bank
which confines itself to a State dependent
very largely on primary products, and conse-
quently on the weather. In fact, there are
three possibilities: (1) the bank may have
been lately declaring its true profits, in which
case the dividends have been pushed up too
rapidly and the amounts put to reserve have
been too little; (2) it may have been writ-
ing off profit to provide for old bad debts;
(3) it may have been stuffing a bit away.to
provide for possible future troubles. M hich
of these it is The Bulletin doesn’t know
for certain.
This paper’s inclination is to accept the
third theory, mainly because the management
has in several ways indicated that it is a
cautious old bird. Thus, though it has at
no time owed the public (depositors, etc.)
more than £1,650.000, it has been slowly but
steadily increasing its capital, until the
latter now amounts to £545,034. Even after
wiping out the reserves altogether, there is
at the present time less than £3 of the
public’s money in the business for every £1
belonging to the shareholders. Here are
the balance-sheet figures :

Premises . . . . 74,290 77,311 Inc. 3,021
In ordinary circumstances one would look
hard on observing that, with shrinking
deposits, considerable advances have been
made —which means that they have had to
conie out of the liquid balances. But the
share capital is so large in proportion to
the business done that there is no' cause at
all for uneasiness. Look at it. The liabili-
ties are £1,536,659. Though the liquid
assets (mostly coin and Commonwealth
notes) have been lately cut into, there is
still £581,136 of them. That leaves only
£955,523 of the public’s money to be repre-
sented by the non-liquid assets; and the
book value of the latter is £1,598,258. This
means that the liquid assets and 60 p.c. of
the book value of the non-liquid assets could
pay out all depositors and other creditors.
It is doubtful whether there is more than
one other bank in Australia capable of the
performance.
But while this means extraordinary
security for depositors, it means com-
paratively poor profits for shareholders. On
capital and reserves combined the visible
earninvs last half-year were at the rate of
only £5 9s. Sd. p.c.; and that puts the Royal
just about at the bottom of that list. But
poor earnings shouldn’t worry either
depositor or borrower so long as they are
due to an excessive amount of share capital
in proportion to borrowed capital. It is
only when poor earnings result from rotten
business, which is liable to get a bank into
difficulties, that customers need be con-
cerned; and there is no hint of rotten busi-
ness in this case. The present isn't a time
to look for deposits, certainly. If it were
the Royal ought to get them. And it ought
to try to get them, too.

The co. got in about £15,000 more premiums,
and still the profits didn’t reach the previous
year’s level. They had a bit clipped off them
at both ends: exes, and claims each moved
up 1 p.c. or more. Things will, however,
have to get a lot worse than that before the
directors have to whittle down the dividend,
seeing that the latter absorbed less than
40 p.c. of the profits. Interest and rents
alone brought in £11.780 —or only £220 short
of the 10 p.c. div. —and there is no reason
to expect that this revenue will shrink much.
The investments on Sept. 30 stood at
£333,341 in the books, and they may be cut
up as follows: Deposits, £113,205; Govern-
ment debentures, £74,697 ; freehold, ;
mortgages, etc., £73,195. Government deben-
tures won’t bring in any less than they have
been doing and bank deposits will presently
bring in more. Freeholds, mortgages, etc.,
may possibly show a smaller return; for.
though interest on mortgage loans will climb
up a few rungs of the ladder, there may be a
few losses on realised securities. Taking it
all round, this and other cos. with big sums
to invest will gain rather than lose bv the
present commotion, provided they haven’t
made injudicious advances on mortgage. This
co.’s hokline- of mortgages is very small—
under £35.000. Its losses of principal will
therefore be negligible, provided that no
quite-unexpected crisis occurs. No doubt the
market value of its debenture holding will
sag. But that doesn’t matter. The co. buys
to hold, and it must get par in the end.
Certainly insurance cos. have had to realise
securities in order to meet claims. But its
experience would have to be abnormal to
make this co. do that. This table shows its
actual experience:—

1914.. 170,819 77,427 74,370 45.3 „ 43.5 „
Now. suppose in the next two years the co.
should be struck by losses twice as great as
it has had in the past two years, and that
would be simply a colossal misfortune. Then,
assuming the same premium income and
expense rate, the co. would have to draw on
its present resources for about £46,000; and,
as shown above, it has nearly three times that
much on deposit alone, besides till money,
etc., sufficient to pay all its debts on Sept.
30. The policy-holder may therefore turn
over in his bed and go to sleep without a
thought about the security—so long as his
is a United Insurance Co. policy. The United
is an Australian office, and at any rate the
Australian policy-holder knows the names and
reputations of the men who run it He
knows, also, the strength of the securities
the funds are in. If he doesn’t he can call
at the head office or any branch and find out.
As for the shareholder, he can reflect (1)
profits from underwriting are liable to shrink,
partly on account of the increased inflam-
mability of premises and stocks in dull times,
but if they shrank to nothing at all the co.
could still pay its div. out of interest earn-
ings, provided the latter didn’t slumo: (21
they are not likely to slump; (3) on
account of the nature of the investments
there isn’t likely to be any at all serious loss
of principal.

Hitherto the reserves have been labelled
“nominal.” Now, however, the whole of the
wreckage which was left when the boom
tide went out has been cleaned up, and the
reserves are consequently passed in as real.
The 6 p.c. dividend is reckoned on the
original paid-up capital, and the directors
put that fact in large black letters. Cer-
tainly there are very few building societies
founded before the smash that still pay their
dividend on the original subscription, so the
Langridge is quite justified in using the extra
ink. It lost money, naturally, but not enough
to necessitate an amputation of any of the
capital, which now stands at £64,270 in
permanent £5 shares, £5170 in fully paid
£2O shares, and £lBB9 in investing shares.
Reserves, as shown in the table, amount to
£19,284; and as there is only £115,745 out
in advances, there is very little of the pub-
lic’s money required in the business. Here

Though practically every penny of the avail-
able funds is lent on mortgage, it is almost
impossible to conceive of a slump that would
drag property values so low as to endanger
the depositors’ money. Further than that,
on account of the fair reserves which the co.
has been building up, there would need to
be a pretty substantial slump before share-
holders’ capital would begin to feel the
strain. Contrary to the general run of
things, the Langridge has been particularly
careful in the matter of new loans, and the
advances item now stands at actually less
than it did in 1912. Also, the deposits are
less than they were in 1911 and 1912. The
combination of circumstances —large reserves,
small liabilities and slow growth of ad-
vances—should take this co. through the
coming tight pinch without the turning of a
hair.

Efficient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The Hardinge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Hecla
Mining Co. that grinding is not such a difficult
problem ; they have installed 64 of them, and say
“the Hardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we hare yet gotten hold of.” If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.
The Austral Otis Kng. Co., Ltd., of Alelbourne, are
the sole representatives for them in the Common-
wealth, and will be glad to forward particulars.* [1

Against that debenture debt there is a so-
ealled sinking fund of £30,575. The weav
point about this fund is that it isn t invested
apart from the business. Presumably its
purpose is to pay off the debt at the end o
a certain period ; but as all the co. s monoj
is in freeholds, advances, Combine shares,
etc., the repayment could only be carried
through by realising assets or by borrowing
afresh; and it is pretty certain that the
latter course would be adopted. Moreover,
the so-called sinking fund isn’t credited with
its own interest earnings. In short, it is a
farce, and the directors ought to be ashamed
of it. . . . • •
The gross revenue last year was :
Pub. and brewery rents ..£7,587
Profit on sales . . . . • • 1,033
C. and U. B. dividends.. .. 8,8u7
Total £17,477
From that deduct £4575 interest, £2133 in-
surance, repairs and other property charges
and £1323 management exes., and you get
the £9446 of profit shown above. Tub and
brewery rents comfortably pay interest and
all property charges, including compensation
fees under Victoria’s scheme for buying out
licenses. In the table of assets, etc., the
Combine shares are valued at £82,000. They
have a face value of £107,625 ; but, as most
of that is goodwill, this co. wrote off £25.625.
There is nothing very substantial in the way
of assets to show for even £82,000. How-
ever, so long as the Combine holds its end
up, the return should be all right; and it
isn’t seriously threatened so far, though, the
Co-operative Co. is a cloud on the horizon.
In taking Castlemaine shares you back the
Combine; for though the co. has £123,910 of
assets apart from Combine shares, it has
£89,443 of liabilities. In other words, it
has its Combine interest plus £34,467 net of
assets. And if the Combine did fall to
pieces the assets mightn’t be worth that
much, because the value of the pubs, for
instance, to a great extent depends on the
popularity and success of the Combine. But
for the present, as remarked above, the Com-
bine seems quite sound, and The Bulletin
can’t detect any white ants in the founda-
tions.
* * * *
Apropos Castlemaine Brewery and Wood’s
(B. 29/10/’l4). A goodwill item of un-
known size has always been included in the
miscellaneous bundle of assets in the
balance-sheet. Basing the figures on what
was told to shareholders who were lucky
enough to attend the meeting 12 .months
ago, the position seems to be something like
this. As at September, 1912, goodwill
stood at £lOO,OOO. Twelve months later
assets were revalued and a surplus of
£38.000 was disclosed. This £38,000, plus
£12,000 taken from visible reserves, was
then used to write down goodwill, which,
after this operation, stood at £50,000. For
the past year £lO,OOO was written off,
which would leave the goodwill loading now
£40,000. The reserves (after paying divi-
dend for the past half-year) were £49,595;
so the true reserves appear now to be
£9595. That is, presuming there is no
other water among the assets; and none can
be detected. But though there are, on this
reckoning, tangible assets to represent the
capital and £9595 over, the 20s. shares are
still worth onlv about 16s. on the market.
The fact that the div. is only 5 p.c. may
explain that. At the same time it is worth
noting that the 5 p.c. div. requires only
£12,500 and that last year’s net profit was
£25,676.

Baker’s Creek (N.S.W.) has got 7380 z.
from 184 tons laboriously scraped together,
and tailings have been stacked. Develop-
ment work continues to eat up most of the
profit from tributors’ crushings and the
stone crushed by the co. on its own account.
Its one recent bit of luck is in being able
to open out levels on the branch vein-—called
the Shaft reef —from the old shaft originally
sunk to work that wonderful little golden
streak known as Smith’s reef. IV ith regard
to tributors, all that can be said is that they
raise stone from odd corners —some of them
places where the explosive nature of the
rock used to render mining too dangerous.
Both Baker’s Creek and the new Hillgrove
Prop, next door have been remarkably
patchy, and theorists don’t agree as to the
cause of the enrichments or the explosive
nature of the rocks in which the richest
stone occurs.
* * * *
No. 2 dredge of Adelong Estates (N.S.W.)
started September with an output for the
week of 6440 z. Then No. 1 went out of
commission, the idea being to fit it to save
the gold in the clay. Since then No. 2’s
poorest return for a week has been 9040 z.
i.ast week it moved to 140 oz. John L.
Wharton’s estimate of costs for the two
plants has ranged from £l2O to £l5O weekly.
So No. 2 dredge is, on its own, building up
a fund to wipe out the balance of the deben-
ture debt, and incidentally to pave the way
to the long-talked-of dividend.
The existence of oil at Warren River, in
sou’-west Westralia, is again pooh-poohed by
Government experts. The petroliferous
possibilities of the locality were first boomed
in 1901, when the finding of lumps of bitu-
men on the beach, and oil-like scum on
the sea, and the alleged occurrence of lignite,
graphite, gas, artesian water, volcanic mud,
basaltic pumice, and a host of other odds and
ends was declared to be a strong indication
of the presence of oil beneath. Samples
analysed on behalf of the co. formed to vet
at this oil were found to contain petroleum ;
but samples tested by the Mines Department
did not show the least trace of oil. Several
glowing accounts of the great value of the
find appeared in the papers, but unfavorable
reports by Government Geologists Maitland
and Woodward and others came out shortly
after, and knocked the bottom out of the
venture. Recently another attemnt was
made to get the public in ; and, in order to
see that they had fair play, Woodward was
sent along by the Mines Department to
make further investigations. He now re-
ports that there are no indications of
petroleum in the district, and that geological
formations are in no way favorable, even if
all the other necessary conditions existed,
lie adds that the entire mass of so-called
evidence adduced in favor of the existence
of oil in the locality is directly traceable to
either company promoters or persons in their
employment, and in order to bring matters
to a head he urges the Government to appoint
some recognised outside oil authority to
report and either endorse or blow out the
assertion of those who disagree with the
opinion of the Government officials.

Edna May (W.A.) put up a record last
month by producing £14,151, and showing
a profit of £9S24—an achievement said to
be mainly attributable to higher values
obtained in driving No. 3 level. The wages
trouble which the co. had with its truckers
and mullockers has been settled by the
directors agreeing to pay the increased rates
demanded.
-X- * * *
Golden Ridge (W.A.) is looking at Allen’s
find, at the Mount Jackson end of Yilgarn.
This makes about the tenth show which the
co. has nibbled at in the last couple of
years without being hooked.
Mountain Queen (W.A.) has turned it
up. Latterly the gold recovery has been so
low that, even with working costs cut down
to 11s., a profit could not be shown, and a
loss of £3OO in September brought things to
a head. About 100 men have been thrown
out of work, and Marvel Loch township
wears a worried look in consequence. When
the Lake View Co. and others tried to sell
the show to London at the end of 1910 and
got landed with most of the scrip, there was
a fair tonnage of payable ore in sight; but
values went to pot at depth, and the
presence of sulphide containing 20 p.c.
arsenic didn’t improve matters. The co.
made a number of unsuccessful experiments
with the refractory stuff, and finally had to
fall back on a low-grade surface deposit of
ironstone in order to keep the mill going;
but this has proved too much of a losing-
game.
Boulder Persevere nen CWAA
that recent developments in the bottom
levels have failed to show any general im-
provement. and that the percentage of profit-
able ore driven on is less than previously.
Reserves remain as they were. Prospecting
in the higher levels is still leading to the
discovery of occasional patches of good ore,
and on the continued success of this work
at shallow depths the future seems to depend.
* * * *
Mararoa (W.A.) is battling for a £ for £
subsidy from the State Government on some
deep boring which it proposes to do in the
optioned Sydney Norseman leases. The co.
has already spent nearly £4OOO in sinking,
driving, etc., and claims that this w rV n a s
proved an immense ore deposit of low value.
The original owners got rich returns from
shallow workings in the early days, and the
argument is that, as good patches were
worked near the surface, some may exist at
depth.
aj: * * *
Tindals (W.A.) has held another half-
yearly meeting and taken the usual hopeful
view of things. The last two returns aver-
aged 235. <Sd., or barely 54dwt. fine gold per
ton. Costs are estimated at between 14s.
and 155.; but, as often pointed out, the dip
of the shoots renders development very ex-
pensive, so what the co. catches on the plates
and in the zinc boxes it loses underground.
Commodore (W.A.) announces that values
show a marked falling off in the stopes.
Although good assays are being obtained be-
low the No. 1 level, it will be some time be-
fore the drive at No. 3 intersects the winze
coming down from the No. 1 workings. The
co. has a fairly big asset imprisoned in its
dumps, and. according to some of its bar-
rackers, will soon pay a div. It had better
lay out what it has got on deeper develop-
ment.
From Weston's (W.A.) : Edna May has
25ft. of reef showing at one point on the
No. 3 level, and, so far, the value is quite up
to expectations. A winze is going down from
No. 2to No. 3 level in 40dwt. ore. A pump-
ing plant is being installed, and shaft sink-
ing should be resumed about the middle of
December —perhaps earlier. A further in-
crease in the monthly output is talked of.
Edna May Central is extending No. 2 level
at a point equivalent to 150 ft. vertical. Wes-
ton’s has now got a main thoroughfare—
Wolfram-street —and it is being lined on both
sides with wood and galvanised iron, with the
usual stores and pubs at the corners.
Hans Irvine has been having a look at the
Comet leases, near Cue (W.A.). Options on
his and others’ behalf were recently taken on
this group, and it is proposed to do some
work on the main line of reef at 100 ft. If
results are satisfactory Melbourne will be
asked to come in.
Golden Pole (W.A.) won’t die. Last
week it issued a half-yearly report showing
that assets, apart from lease, plant, build-
ings, etc., consist of £320 cash and £OO3
worth cf stores. For the want of a quorum
shareholders have not held a meeting for a
century or two.
Last half-year Northern Hope. Beaufort
(Vic.), escaped calls by getting 24G50z. from
954 fathoms. This shows the best average
for any alluvial claim in Victoria at present.
The mine is not a big patch on the Beaufort
gutter, but if even 2oz. dirt continues it
will (with luck and patience and a clever
Ballarat crowd behind it) do very cheerful
things. Costs averaged 90s. per fathom,
but the driving of ;the under levels north-
west and south-west was included in this.
Rising can-now go on, as command can be
got of the gutter, the ground having dipped
under-level in the old workings. Meantime
a patch of wash 400 ft. by 320 ft. is available
for panelling.; and as it prospects 20z..
development can proceed without cost to the
shareholders.
As Bendigo’s Central Red. White and Blue
has beaten out the payable stone on the east
leg of the saddle at the 21S. 318 and 400 feet
levels, its last half-yearly brew is very thin.
They have been trying to punch out profits
on the west leg of the saddle, but with heavy
development work ahead 4|dwt. stone won t
foot up many dividends. Last half-year
14.142 tons gave 32790 z.. and there is no
present belief that this will be bettered dur-
ing the current term. At 640 ft. there is
more mullock than quartz, and at 880tt. the.
co. has to come back near the shaft to try
the big quartz shoot there. Things are not
much more cheerful at 960 ft. About all
that can be said of the east leg of the for-
mation at 1040 ft. is set out in geologist
Cundy’s opinion that it should be persevered
with.' The good points about the Central
Blue are that it has pushed down its shaft,
that it may get gold in the spurs to the west
at 218 ft.. and that there is scope for pro-
specting for the run of stone that is changing
the Sheepshead’s fortunes next door.
Having opened with a lodwt. crushing,
New Day Dawn, Maldon (Vic.), is settling
down to’ listen to the applause. So far as
reefs go, the co. rests on big feet. It has a
western formation 10ft. wide, in which a
shoot 80ft. long is open to the pick. In the
north end little gold is showing—-Maldon s
commonest complaint. South the gold is
still more infrequent. Beneath the level, in
the winze, a horse of mullock has cut out,
s i that the 10ft. reef may be more than a
patch. East the co. has the Cumberland and
the Cricketers reefs to draw on, and west
is the old Jubilee formation. This last gave
good surface stone, but old hands threw it
up rather than spend money and time on
finding out if a second make of gold existed
at depth. The co.’s assets, therefore, are lots of
stone, prospects just what shareholders care
to think, and a battery that has seen better
days. On this base the market won t build
high. Instead of listening to the talk of
buying new plant, the co. needs to sink and
drive, using its present battery to treat the
bulk samples. # #
North Nuggetty, Daylesford (Vic.), had a
stroke of bad luck at the end of last week.
A fire broke out in the top-hamper, and the
engine-house, boilers, air compressor and
surface gear all went. The co. reckons that
£5OOO won’t cover the loss. About 130 men
are off as a result.
* * * *
Charters Towers, though still in a bad
wav, has promise of a dividend or two before
the end of the year. Clark’s mine crushed
128 tons for 7120 z., and the tailings sold at
an average of £2 6s. 4d., making a total
return of £2752, which pans out £_l
13s. 10d. per ton of stone. The deepest level
(469 ft.) provided the bulk of this crushing.
The latest report is that the 426 ft. level has
met with good stone. Nevertheless, the
Moonstone-Treasure group is not to be
trusted. Another mine in the same locality,
the Papuan, crushed 186 tons for £lO ss.
per ton; and concentrates realised no less
than £7B Bs. per ton, and residues £3 4s. 2d.
The Sulphide Corporation is again buying
concentrates, so the necessity for grinding
in Berdan pans is obviated.
* * f *
Practically all Australia’s gem-stones
went to Germany; so, no other market
being yet developed, gem-mining is dead.
Anakie (Q.) sapphire field is deserted, and
the N.S.W. opal fields are even more
shrivelled than they have been lately.
* -* * *
The Vulcan, Queensland’s biggest tin mine,
is working with only a dozen men. and stone
is being crushed irregularly. There isn’t
anything at all enticing in the workings,
and the shareholders are not losing much by
the disorganisation of the market. The best
stone is in the upper levels. Recent pro-
siting at 1220 ft. has given very poor
results. *

“Billy Blue” : The first coal brought from
Newcastle to Sydney came in a fishing boat
in June, 1796 —a sack or so for Gov. Hunter to
see. Next year Lieut. Shortland, of H.AI.S.
Reliance, who discovered the Hunter River,
also brought samples of coal to Sydney. In
1801 Gov. King determined to open the
mines at Newcastle, and one John I’latt, who
had been a coal-miner in England, was
despatched in charge of a number oi con-
victs with that object in view. They sent
down as their first contribution 24 tons ot
fuel, which his Ex. bartered with the ship
Marquis of Cornwallis for merchandise. The
coal was valued at £3 a ton. King sent up
two casks of porter to the colliers to "wet
it.” John I‘latt afterwards became a mine-
owner, and when he died had 2000 acres
of coal-bearing land, which the A. A. Co.
bought for £OOOO. Plattsburg, near New-
castle, keeps his name green.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, November 2, 1914.
My Dear Arini, —
“The rejoicings over the rain.” says a
Sydney voice from Melbourne, “drown the
very subdued protests over a wet Derby
Day. Water was getting scarce everywhere.
Even seaside places like Queenscliff were
confronted with a large drizzle of more or
less empty tanks. The prospect of buying
water by the quart from a perambulating
barrel struck terror to the hearts of Mrs.
Seaside Boarding House, who finds a war
sufficiently- upsetting without having a
water-hunger in her back yard.”
The departure of N.S.W. visitors to the
Cup was unheralded this year by the usual
flourish of announcements in the press. The
Mayoral party slipped off “on a visit to
Victoria.” Other well-known folks packed
up their baggage, and decided to take a
change of air in the southern city for the
good of their health. Dr. and Mrs. Lips-
couibe admitted in a soft whisper that they
were tripping over to Melbourne for the
first week in November. In their party
(which is sheltering at Menzies’) went
solicitor Osborne Norris and si ter Etta. Qn
the whole, however, a team of wild elephants
couldn’t drag any direct remark that could be
used against them concerning Cup frivolities
in these thrilling days.
The Premiers’ Conference was, by one of
those lucky coincidences that dodge politi-
cians, arranged for Cup week. So there has
been a mild Ministerial exodus from Mac-
quarie-street.
Governor Strickland and his blue-eyed
treasure, daughter Mary, with Help
d’Apice at their heels, went off to the Cup.
They got to Melbourne in time to see the
lain fall on Derby Day, just as it falls on
washing day, or any old day when Woman
is looking for fine weather.
In the piping times of peace, the fact that
a bit of bunting does or does not flap on
the housetop of the plain citizen is not a mat-
ter of much concern to the neighbors. But
the present uproar has changed all that. In
English hamlets, where the yelps of spesh’l
’dition news-vendors don’t rend the air, bunt-
ing has its uses. An old Australian pioneer,
It. A. Christison, a one-time Queensland
pastoralist, is now living in an ivy-whiskered
country house, Burwell Hall, in Lincolnshire.
When the news from the Franco-Belgian
stadium is good, the Union Jack and the
Australian flag flap triumphantly over his
roof, to the great joy of Hodge.
Conflicting accounts come this way con-
cerning the “pleasant afternoons” which
Lady Patey and others Avho are connected
by matrimony with the Admiralty have been
pushing aiong. They are usually located
in the Naval House, and are designed
for the amusement of sailors’ wives,
who can bring the baby if they
want to, and bask in the society of official
dames. Light refreshments are generally
turned on, and the sailor’s wife is supposed
to return to her domestic hob greatly exhila-
rated by the joy of shaking hands with the
Admiralty lady. Sometimes the exhilara-
tion is damped by the guest keeping so
sba ’p a look-out for “patronage” that she
gets her feathers on end at imaginary
slights. These shows must be almost as
hard to run without friction as a tea-meet-
ing in a bush settlement.
Charles Markell, a Sydney merchant, was
motoring with his decorative wife and
daughter in the south of Germany when the
lid blew off the pot. How they got through
to Holland they don’t quite know, but the
struggle included (for the male of the
party) all-night standing-room only in a
mad express train, followed by (for all the
party) an all-night wait in a queue of
refugees. Nobody knows what became of
the luggage. Mr. Markell, who is coming
back via the United States, has a ticket
acknowledging receipt of it. He’s a keen
business man. but if you’ll send him £2 for
the ticket I think you’ll get it.
The Royal Art Society mentions, on khaki
leaflets, that it is going to display its blanks
and winners this month in the same old
hot-air box on the summit of Vickery’s
Chambers (76 Pitt-street). November 14
is private view day of this the 35th annual
exhibition.
The professional musicians are searching
for a bit of butter to spread on the dry
crust that is the lot of the average long-
hair just now. The search is conducted on
systematic lines. Day by day the P.M.’s
band dispenses better music than its foreign
predecessors, but it hasn’t got the same busi-
ness habits. For instance, instead of attack-
ing our more respectable suburbs at 10 a.m.
when nobody is in the parlor, and nearly
everything in skirts has a broom in its
hand and its front hair in curling-pins, why
doesn’t the new band follow the routine of
its forerunners? That means tackling the
same thoroughfare any time after 4 p.m.,
having fewer full stops in the programme,
giving the cornet-player a hint to round off
his sharp corners, and getting into a uni-
form. These .details count. The miscel-
laneous appearance of the Professional
Musicians’ band doesn’t catch the public
eye, which is accustomed to see the kerb-
stone performers smartly uniformed. How
about the Russian dark-green garb? Made
in light-weight drill it would be cool and
comfortable.
Mr. Ramaciotti. the motoring enthusiast,
who is, or was,- a colonel hereabouts, returns
in the Orsova, after a long absence from this
hamlet.

Minister for Public Health Flowers in-
tends that the languishing Alice Rawson
School for Mothers shall continue to save
infant life on a much larger scale as a
“clinic.” This is a fine, upstanding word
that sounds like a medical library with an
operation in the middle. In the rough it
means that Baby, whom mother feeds on a
suck of bacon rind and a bit of cabbage—
in short, a taste of “anything its father likes”
—is to be given a chance through the in-
struction of its maternal parent in the way
she should go at meal time. It means a
little more than this: but that is its chief
intention —to give toddlers a chance of not
perishing from starvation administered by
ignorance in frequent doses.
Qn November 7 (he Coast Hospital will
have a foundation-stone party. Big addi-
tions to the lone hospital will date from this
ceremonial.
The quaint Dan Crawford, F.R.G.S., the
missionary who thinks the savages of Cen-
tral Africa are,so much better than we that
he proposes to go back to them at once,
leaving us greater sinners to our fate, had
the ear of an unreported meeting of Sydney
merchants the other day. Mr. Braddon,
head of the big house of Dalgety’s, had
somehow been prevailed on to invite the
commercial potentates to meet Daniel, and
he made a speech in which he assured the
remarkable person that they were all wait-
ing to hear something about the trade
problems and possibilities of darkest Africa.
Then Dan mounted the stump and told the
merchants an iriterminable storv about a lion
which had made pie of 56 villagers, and of
the elephants, which were once so thick
that the natives made stockades out of the
tusks to keep the wild beasts away. Evi-
dently Mr. Braddon expected the Sydney
heavyweights to do him serious harm for
calling them up to listen to yarns they
would have reckoned over the odds even
in their early schoolboy days; anyway, he
grabbed his hat and toi’e off for his life.
Another man, who the other day came
back from somewhere near the heart of
Africa, hasn’t said a word about it in
public. John Tilley, a young mining
engineer, went on behalf of a London com-
pany into Upper Nigeria, and camped for a
while not far from where the Sahara is
supposed to start. From all accounts the
Sahara isn’t what the schoolbooks used to
say it was; and you can’t be in Nigeria
very long without meeting some Eurooean
or other —generally a Frenchman —who has
casually wandered across it from the Medi-
terranean. Look for Nigeria on the map
and you will find it a small blot of no
apparent consequence. The returned Aus-
tralian didn’t count them all, but says the
British official estimate of population is
24.000,900.
Dr. Chappie, the Southern Otago man
who used to practise in Wellington (M.L.),
is now in London, assisting in Red Cross
work. He is M.l*. for Stirling, is the son
of an Otago farmer, and is given to occa-
sional incursions into the Inky Way. After
taking one degree in M.L. he went to Bull
Babylon and caught another. So fortified
he hied home to his native earthquake, and
built up a big practice in Wellington. With
his charming personality he ought to be able
to get every Maorilandcr in London inter-
ested in the cause of lint and bandage.
Mrs. and Miss Miinro, of Masterton
(M.L.), who wintered in this sunny clime,
went off to their home-nest the other day,
via Wellington. Mrs. Munro belongs to the
Hector family, whose head was that well-
known man of science, the late James
Hector, formerly Chancellor of Maoriland
University.
The watery suburb of Lane Cove is mop-
ping its heated brow, after a big patriotic
scoop the other afternoon. The Hunter’s
Hill committee has not counted the entire
proceeds, but nearly £4OO is likely to be
dropped into the patriotic hat. W. A. Win-
deyer was hon. sec. of this raid.
The astounding Phil Newbury, who fare-
welled Sydney (for a time, anyhow) on
October 31, is a musical chameleon. It
would be a rash prophet who would foretell
the color of the voice the tenor would pro-
duce a day or two subsequently. Just now
he is singing his best and sweetest. tjis
remarkable vocal organ, scarcely impaired bj
the years the locust hath gobbled up ( I have
an idea for a poem beginning, “The locust sat
at dinner and his plate was full of years ),
was a revelation to any hasty person in the
audience who had been thinking or Newbury
as a "has-been.” Very few modern singeis
can eclipse the brilliant technique which our
occasionally-exasperating Newbury showed in
Gounod’s “Lend Me Your Aid,” or in the
majestic Handel item, “Where er You
Walk.” Mrs. Emily Spada, in better voice
than when she last sang in this town, was
another surprise. Organist Truman made
the big Town Hall instrument bellow its
loudest in his own composition, March in
F.” Mrs. Slapoffski shook the rafters with
her top notes, and organist Lilian Frost
contributed to the harmony of the evening.
The Phil Newbury concert co. proceeds later
to India.
Mischel Cherniavsky, the fiddler of the
Maud Allan co., celebrated his 21st birthday
on November 2. The party took place from
4 to 6 p.m. in the Hotel Sydney.
Golf is too strenuous a sport for corpu-
lent middle-age in a heat wave. Ten days
ago the valuable life of solicitor Alfred
Nathan was sacrificed to the little white
balls on Leura links. In spite of this
warning, stout citizens plodded after the
same form of pleasure on local greens in
Saturday’s fierce sun. At Kensington two
well-known Sydney men collapsed and had
lo be carried off the ground, to the great
alarm of their acquaintances. A dead faint
was all the damage on this occasion.
In New York city the picturesque length
of artist Hugh McGrae has already attracted
the notice of Australians who didn’t
know him personally. One of these obser-
vant exiles stated that there was another
Australian in town —lie knew it by the shape
of the man’s sombrero and by his swinging
stride. The shady millinery he sticks
to is, by the way, the kind that few
Australians, in towns or cities, actually wear
just now. The male head is more or less
(chiefly more) uncovered under a small felt
hat with about an inch of brim.
Mr. 11. Wade, an English partner in a
York-street warehouse, has finished his
business in Sydney, and is now going to
sample every kind of Maoriland scenery that
can be crammed into a six weeks’ tour.
After doing the hot springs he gets into the
King country, where the traveller is allowed
to carry medical comforts in his valise, but
must not buy the same —if the Law is look-
ing his way. From Taumaranui he glides
down (he enchanting Wanganui (if there’s
enough water in this droughty year to glide
on), and finishes his trip under the snows
of the Southern Alps. Then he takes a long
breath and returns to England.
The cataract of patriotic verse which is
flooding every newspaper office here is goad-
ing the British press to rise up and defend
its premises. The Daily Mirror implores
the amateur poets to go and drill, learn to
shoot, or take lessons in Red Cross work —
in fact, do anything but write poems. Of
course, if you could read your poem to the
enemy it might do him material damage, but
the enemy won’t wait.
There is a mention of the famous baritone
Bispham having had the degree of Doctor
of Laws handed to him by his old ’Varsity,
Ilaverford College, near Philadelphia. It is
one of the milder eccentricities of universi-
ties to make Doctors of Laws of musicians
and other patriots who have never taken
6s. Bd. for legal advice in tluir lives. Blsp-
ham, whose genial personality made a stack
of friends during his Australian tour, be-
longs to an ancient family of English
Quakers who were friends of Penn, and
settled in Philadelphia when it was mostly
village, with a fringe of Red Indians on the
horizon.
The female form is laid out in terraces in
the new summer frocks. It seems to be of
no great moment how small the woman in-
side the dress may be so long as she chooses
to cultivate the tier upon tier effect in her
garments. In a strong north-easter the
terraced lady looks like a smart little craft
in full sail up a crowded street on Louis
XYI. heels. The cab horse, which has many
troubles in this congested city, may some
day bite off a few of these dressy extras
that flap under his nose at every crowded
crossing.
Alfred Hill’s long forelock spread its
tresses to the air the other evening, as Alfred
himself waved all over the place behind a
baton. He is a most tense, look-alive
leader, and he is shaking uo the Sydney Ama-
teur Orchestral Society to give a steadily
improving account of itself. The invalu-
able aid of fiddler Henri Staell was thrust
on the listening ear.in the solo he played in
the big Beethoven Concerto. The recent
concert, which was the third of the season,
drew an audience that almost filled the
Town Hall, in spite of the incessant clamor
of patriotic and benefit entertainments.
Arthur Appleby, the Voice of the orchestral
outbreak, was better placed in the heavy-
weight item, “David singing before Saul,”
than in subsequent efforts. Sometimes, when
this subject cropped up, I have felt sorry for
Saul. This time I considered that the
farmer-king was having the time of his life.
The death of a genuine old inhabitant, the
late Robert Crichton, formerly of Round
Hill, Riverina, is mentioned in the Britisii-
Austbalasian (London). lie was 102
when the bell tolled for his passing in Cater-
ham Valley (Eng.). At least he was said
to be 102, and even if he was only 95 he
was an Old Inhabitant. Half a century
ago he was squatting on the plains this side
of the Murray. With him was a brother.
A sister joined them later on. The three
were so delighted with each other’s company,
and with the peaceful, sheepful plains, and
the mild pastoral state of single blessedness,
that they agreed never to marry, and to live
together' all their lives. As Robert must
have been well on towards 60 when he took
the vow, he can’t be said to have rushed
headlong into celibacy. Apparently it grew
on him. Anyhow, the compact was faith-
fully kept. The deceased was the last of
that bright band. He retained his faculties
almost to the end. Being a keen sport, up to
the age of 97, or some other advanced period,
he regularly rented a shooting-box in Scot-
land.
Oswald Anderson, a well-known Sydney
writer of melodious songs, is said to be ion
his way back to his native eucalyptus. He
has been in Britain for IS months or so;
The Russell-Joneses —mamma and daugh-
ters —are cutting out part of their foreign
tour, owing to circumstances over which
they have no control. They left London in
October, and propose to drift home via the
Beef Trust, and the Oil Trust, and the
Chicago meat works, and the great plains,
and any bison that is left, and the fragments
of the San Francisco earthquake.
The rush of dashing Australians to join
King Edward’s Horse will give a line gum-
tree flavor to the show. Two Victorians,
T. 11. Davies and L. M. Lush, described
rather vaguely as “both of the Melbourne
and Ballarat School of Mines,” have added
their names. Possibly they will sell the
Kaiser a wild cat, and thus complete his
ruin.
Martha was troubled about many things.
That’s a long time ago, before she took to
sheltering orphans and getting into the
wholesale charity business. The Home that
bears her name at Leichhardt is a hive of
industry, where many Marthas teach the
young person the use of the broom and the
lighter industry of lace-making. Results
will be on view at a sale of work to be opened
at the Home on Saturday afternoon (Novem-
ber 7).
There’s a notice in the London Gazette
to the effect that Leon Herbert Spencer
Brodzky has by deed poll (whatever that
may be) "absolutely renounced and aban-
doned” his surname. He now looks the
whole world in the face as Brodney. Of
course you remember the Brodzkys, who
formerly ran Melbourne Table Talk?
The Ulysses brought back a big booking
of homeward-bounding Australians, and many
of them told stirring tales of the
celerity of their retreat from Central Europe.
Dr. Chenhall had exciting experiences, and a
Queenslander, Mr. J. W. Greene, had the
luck to snatch his sister from the Belgian
storm-centre before the horrors of the mailed
fist blocked the flight: of tourists.
Tenor Walter Kirby came this way in the
Moeraki from Wellington (M.L.), where
local Society purred softly on his shoulder.
The Liverpool sub-regal circle gave a lead,
and Kirby’s dulcet notes were uplifted in
the Presence.
As the prospect of a better and dearer
telephone is now dangling before our eyes,
it might be helpful to consult Fred Niblo on
this subject. There is a ’phone service to
Baldpate Inn (the Criterion stage hostel
which has seven keys to its front door) that
beats anything in town. It probably beats
anything on earth. Baldpate Inn is a sum-
mer resort on top of a mountain. The play
is set on a winter night. The wind howls
like a thousand hyenas. Does it “cross” the
’phone lines? Does it give the operators the
chance to yell “Engaged” from the other
end of Nowhere? No ! In the dead of night
that ’phone speaks up the instant the hero,
the caretaker, the' villainess or anybody else
puts an ear to the receiver. It does what
no other instrument has ever been known to
do —it calls for the police and gets them
right on the place, where are wanted.
Though the call is countermanded, still they
climb that mountain in the middle of a fine,
well-grown snowstorm. If Niblo would give
away the priceless secret of the Baldpate
’phone service, he would be worth about one
million dollars.
Pianist Gertrude Palmer had the latter
end of her trip to Europe cut off by the
sword that William of Ilohenzollern un-
sheathed. She came back to her native
Sydney the other day and lent her aid, at
the piano, to the Newbury farewell.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

HELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, November 2, 1914.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Derby Day was a time of joy and macin-
toshes. The crowd was clammy but cheer-
ful, the pastoralist section of it gambolling
in the mud as though to encourage the
Rain Trust to further efforts. The G.-G.
arrived on time, and so did Lady Helen,
almost naughtily smart in champagne voile,
topped with fussy tulle and cream plumage.
She waited until the Derby was run and
then bolted to the Red Cross corroboree at
the Exhibition —after doing the right thing
by Carlita, the winner.
Governor Stanley also splashed away from
the meeting, to catch the tail-end of the
University concert. The Government
House coop sheltered the Galways (she in
sapphire blue and white osti’ich top-dress-
ings)., the Stricklands (Miss Strickland
resplendent in duck-egg blue silk and a
macintosh) ; Miss D’Erlanger, in navy-blue
crepe, and Lady Doris Blackwood, in blue
ninon and a blue hat. Also, some dejected-
looking aides. Mrs. Don Mackinnon, in
neat navy-blue, and Edna Arm.vtage, in a
Burberry coat, were among the Elect for a
time.
Sydney’s Mayoress, Mrs. Richards, was
seen sheltering in black caracul. John
Forrest’s dame kept within the folds of
a musquash wrap. Three Bendigo Lansells
—Mrs. George (black crepe de chine). Mrs.
Victor (grey and ermine) and Edith (black
and white) were to be observed beneath the
umbrellas on the stand. The Fred Fair-
bairn dame stood out in tailor-made smart-
ness; and Jess Fairbairn (navy blue) and
Esther (black and white check) wore
clothes rather than threw themselves into
covers. Ruby Clarke, the newest bride-to-
be. was a dream of black and white. Mrs.
Hennessy was buried in a foaming swirl of
black taffetas and cream net. Mrs. George
Woodforde sported cream cloth. Mrs.
Dick Casey emerged occasionally in navy
crepe de chine and black tulle. The most
striking toilet seen on the lawn was George
Buchanan’s rain-proof, when it got wet. lie
showed through it like an X-ray subject, or
a lnresome Salome dancer, and was the
envy of every Society bud who had left her
ninon open-work spread out on the bed at
home.
The University Red Cross concert —helped
by the Philharmonic Soc., the Musical Soc.
of Vic., the Melb. Conservatorium, the Musi-
cians’ Union, the Lady Northcote Orches-
tra, the Symphony Orchestra, the Amateur
Orchestral Soc., the Festival Choir, the
Vic. Orchestral Association, the Geelong-
Choral Soc., the University Choral Soc., two
military bands, a batch of buglers under
J. 11. Cherry, with W. A. Laver, Alberto
Zelman, and J. J. Bailey conducting, and
Dr. Price at the organ —filled the Exhibition
Building on Saturday afternoon. But the
star item—Melba conducting the Handel
“Hallelujah Chorus” —had to be cut out.
She had bronchitis —the same bronchitis
that kept her from the Rose Show. A silver-
mounted baton went begging, also a Belgian
flag, which the invalid was to have auc-
tioned. It was all very sad, especially for
the folks who had abandoned Flemington
and paid for concert seats in the hope of
seeing Melba do her little stunts. Under
the shadow of this affliction the show was a
slightly disjointed affair. Most of the turns
worked furiously up to climaxes which
never arrived.
The French, Belgian and Russian national
anthems were sawn off fervently as each
Consul of the different nations arrived. This
meant standing up three distinct times, and
three times mislaying one’s programme,
chocolate box, bag, wet umbrella and seat.
The British Anthem was sung by all the
choirs on the arrival of Fritz Hart and a
couple of newspaper reporters. Someone
had mistaken the small, hirsute musician
and his friends for vice-regalities. The
last-mentioned didn’t turn up till 4 p.m. (an
hour late), when the standing business had,
of course, to be repeated. The Hallelujah
Chorus brought the assembly to its now
tired and swollen feet for the fifth
time. In fact, the seats seemed to be only
intended for ornaments. And that is all
they are in such circumstances. Patriotism
of the good old kind can’t be expressed while
lolling in the luxurious comfort of a yellow,
wooden chair.
The scene was an impressive one. The
entire platform and organ loft were banked
with rows and rows of white-wrapoered
choral angels of every age, size and shape.
Also, there were more rows of beautiful male
angels garbed in black, and behind them
were bandsmen in khaki. Away up near the
roof gleamed the head of organist Price as
he pedalled madly beneath yards of bunting.
And triumphant in the foreground waved,
in turn, every different brand of conductor
on the premises amidst a forest of orchestra.
Melba didn’t open the Rose Show, after
all, much to the annoyance of the multitude,
most of whom had paid the entrance money
not so much to see the flowers as to fore-
gather with the singer. Bronchitis, it
seems, hit her with a mallet at Coombe
Cottage, and she was unable to get up. to
time. She sent along a sheaf of Lily-
dale roses, which were flung into glass pots
on two black velvet tables. Also her bless-
ing. But they didn’t make up for her
absence. Mayor Hennessy acted the invidi-
ous part of emergency-opener in the subdued
spirit of a five-foot man who is suddenly
called on to assume a Giant’s Robe. His
wife looked cheery enough, however. She
wore a navy blue suit, a buffi waistcoat, and
above all a frisky, blue-feathered black hat.
The 25-guinea Sargood trophy went to J.
Tallent, the president.
Mrs. Hussey B. Chomley—known widely
as dear “Aunt Hussey”—died one day last
week at Coonac, Toorak. She was small
and brisk and lovable, and the possessor of
a figure that was absolutely flapperish. She
had been a notable social figure in the days
when her husband, the Police Commissioner,
was alive, but latterly she put in most of
her time tripping to Europe. Her two sons
—Alec, who was a crack tennis-player, and
Arthur, whom Melbourne knew as Pat —
both died before her. There are multitudes
of nephews and nieces, however, one of the
latter being stately Mary.
The Australian aviators at the front are
Oswald Watt, who has just been made a
capitaine (lie was a captain of the Common-
wealth forces already) ; Sidney Pickles,
who was badly smashed up by a fall from
his ’plane last year; and Eric Conran. The
Conrans belong to Adelaide. Y'oung Eric
was in Sydney for a while last summer. He
is one of the few Australians who know the
German Crown Prince. The younger Con-
rans met the young German royalties at
St. Moritz a year or two ago, and have since
stayed with them in Germany.
Peter Dewar, of the big whisky firm, is a
captain in the Black Watch, and returns to
Britain to rejoin his regiment. Many
friends of his have fallen in France and
Belgium, and that stinging fact has hurried
the man of peace into his uniform.
Douglas Landale, who was a son of Mrs.
Alec Landale and an officer in the Rifle
Brigade, has fallen in action. He was a
good-looking youth with every prospect of a
pleasant life ahead of him. His brother
George and his brother-in-law Cyril are on
their way to the front.
The sport of the moment, par excellence,
is what may be called cadging without tears.
You get t the money out of the people so
pleasantly that they don’t feel the anguish
of separation. A good example is the trip down
the bay which has been arranged for Novem-
ber 14, on behalf of the Red Cross Fund.
The Lady Loch is to be got free from the
Victorian Government. The food is to be
torn from some other benevolent soul, and
the drinks likewise, and the passengers are
to pay ss. each. Mrs. F. Ilagelthorn and
other Malvernites originated the scheme and
it should earn much cash.
Another inspiration was a theatre party,
to aid a fund for buying an armored car.
This frivol occurred on Thursday night.
Some geniuses from the Barracks conceived
it. and the scene of revelry was the Princess’s
Theatre. I don’t quite see where the profit
came in. It is hardly likely that the box-
office took the party’s admission-money and
then passed it on to the car. However, there
must have been some profits, as the venture
is to be repeated.
About 4000 patriots danced at St. Kilda’s
famous Palace last week, at 2s. (id. per head,
in aid of the local fund. And yet the besotted
Kaiser continues to think us disloyal! The
Hennesseys grouped themselves with the
Ilewisons and Mr. William Watt, M.P. The
latter said terrible things about the Kaiser,
and thanked manager Phillips for lending
his property. Mayor Hewison mentioned
that about £lOO had been raised in St.
Kilda to buy a set of regimental colors for
the 14th Battalion of the Expeditionary
Force. How about raising another 30s. and
cabling the dread news to Potsdam?
A 20-guinea prize was won by Rene
Miller, of the Green Dandies, because he
held the entrance ticket with the right num-
ber on it —which is not gambling, because it
is done in the holy name of Patriotism.
Miss Quirk, of Melbourne, is still in
Marienbad. She is living entirely on
lOU’s, which I have always thought must
be one of the most delightful care-free lives
imaginable. And yet she hates it. In one
censor-passed p.c. she mentions that she
can’t buy a Union Jack for love or money.
Such is grim, relentless war.
Some of our returned trippers are telling
confiding friends hectic tales of the field-
marshals who implored them to fly to the
front and nurse the sick and wounded. The
fact that they (the trippers) were totally
uncertificated does not seem to have worried
the field-marshals. Also, a youthful doctor was
urged to take charge of a hospital ship, or
field ambulance or something. In every
case these requests were declined, the per-
sons rushed being pledged to attend to im-
portant duties at home. The field-marshal,
or whoever he was, is understood to have
been hideously disappointed.
From “Rosna,” at present of London:
The Dudlev Field Hospital is at St. Nazaire at the
hour of writing, but may be almost anywhere by the
time this reaches you. Among his assistants Douglas
Shields has a son of Melbourne’s Colonel Wallace,
Rupert Reynell, of the S.A. wine-growing clan, who
was a Rhodes scholar from Adelaide; and Di. Home,
of the Commonwealth forces. The nurses, who are all
Australians but two, wear grey uniforms, with scarlet
capes and grey aprons. Out of doors they affect
grey military coats and bonnets.
A grand-opera season started recently at the Middle-
sex Theatre (which used to be the Middlesex Music
Hall, and previous to that the Mogul), and the works
that were rendered included “Carmen, ’ “Trovatore,
“Faust” and “Rigoletto.” Nora D’Argel, of Welling-
ton (M.L.), did well as Marguerite, and as Micaela
in “Carmen.” Mrs. Manson, of Dunedin (M.L.), and
Adelaide van Staveren, daughter of Wellington’s
Rabbi, were also in the cast. The season ran brilli-
antly for a fortnight, and then fell dead with war
fever.
Among the prisoners taken in Germany at the
outbreak of the war was W. Bryceson Trehearne, one-
time of Adelaide Conservatorium. He happened to be in
Bavaria, and couldn’t get out. William has rather a flair
for adventure. He it was who ran up against brigands
in Paris some years ago, and was rudely separated
from £3OO.
A war ditty that goes strorm in London
these times is “My Country's Gall,” the
music, by "A. Ivingston-Stewart, having a
true stir in it. A light ditty from the
same composer —“My All-the-week Girl —is
warbled by Maurice Farkoa, the Anglo-
French comedian who came to this country
with Iloggenheimer, Huntley and Go., and
was remarkable for a wisp of white in his
black thatch. Kingston-Stewart is a South
Australian, with the family name of
Otto. Through the other side of the
family he is cousin to the musical Kingston
sisters, the youngest of whom. Lena, is now
in London getting her voice trained for grand
opera.
Two engagements are officially reported in
the clever Dyson family. “Ted” Dyson, Austra-
lia’s most fluent writer of light verse, short
stories, political and other articles, novels,
pamphlets, encyclopaedias, dictionaries, para-
graphs, epic and other poems, and literary
efforts in general (including philippics,
essays and diatribes) —Edward Hyson, I
repeat, is engaged. The other party to the
action is Dorothy Boyes, a golden-haired
St. Kilda angel who did the music to the
words of Dyson’s “Billy Khaki.” Dorothy
is an artist as well as a musician, and has
blue eyes, pink cheeks and gentle ways.
Simultaneously, or thereabouts, Ettie Dyson,
“Ted’s” little sister, who is chiefly famous
for dressing like a fashion-plate and looking
like a portrait by an old master, has been
secured by Harrison Owen. The above
happy state of affairs is notable as consti-
tuting a divergence from custom. The
Dvsons mostly marry Lindsays. Lionel
Lindsay married one of them, and Will
Dyson, now a famous London caricaturist,
reciprocated by espousing the pretty girl who
draws as “Ruby Lind.”
Miss Ruby Clarke arrived from England
with her mother by the Medina. The stock-
broking head of the family is coming on
later. They are staying at the W. L.
Baillieu Toorak cottage for a space, the
maiden being engaged to Clive Baillieu.
Ivy Clarke has been busy shopping since
she got back from Europe. A recent bar-
gain-sale purchase was the Arthur Hoopers’
house in Toorak. She is going in shortly
after Christmas.
Betty Sawers, a daughter of the late John
Sawers, of Melbourne, is to marry in Lon-
don the son of English Baronet Milman.
The young man must have remarkable
strength of character, or he would be at
the war. Life is a mockery ■in England,
by all accounts, for the marriageable male
who is not either just off to the front or
just back from it.
Rendigonians talk rapturously of their new
songbird, Mollie Macaboy, who is to out-
rival Amy Castles. She has a charming
Irish personality, and a name very popular
on the goldfields since the days of her grand-
father. the Judge. At the recent Ballarat
Tournament she won seven first prizes.
Charlie Bright, having been convicted of
taking whooping-cough from his _ small
daughter, is now interned till such time as
the whoop shall have faded. This means
that the cheery Deputy-P.M.G. will see
nothing of the Cup revels.
Bertha Ballenger, daughter of Colonel
Ballenger, of St. Kilda, appeared lately as
a neat, slim Stephanie in “The Sign of the
Cross.” As some slight tribute to her gifts
she has been re-engaged with the Julius
Knight co. for a nine months’ tour of M.L.
Wilfrid Madden, brother of pianiste Doris,
is back from India and the horse-shipping
trade, there being no horses available to ship.
He is staying for a while at his brother
Maurice’s farm in S. Gippsland—a region
where the drought has been raging briskly,
so that the fatted calf of welcome lias de-
generated into a mere shadow of its old
self.
Florrie Young and Co. opened in the
Auditorium on Derby night in “The Climax.
The play is a tame, gentle, two-hours-and-a-
half affair, and it is administered to the
audience by Claude Bantock, Reggie Roberts,
Ed. Sherras, and, of course, Florrie. I
don’t want to say anything rude about “The
Climax,” but it strikes me that a small
comic opera or, a minstrel show would have
suited the combination better. Florence
was buried beneath an avalanche of vege-
table, and emerged looking grateful.
The Caledonian Society held a Hallow-
e’en disturbance, maistly for the bairns and
suchlike, on Saturday nicht last. Mrs.
Gregor Wood and the Hugh Paterson daugh-
ters led the Hieland reels and jigs until the
din and furious commotion fairly drove the
lads and lassies oot and hame at the sinfu’
hour of 10. Geo. Buchanan, nresident of
the society, was to blame for the orgy.
The Melbourne motor-’buses have already
disposed of three harmless citizens. A
waitress was exterminated by one at St.
Kilda. The next victim was a private of
the Victorian Expeditionary Force, who met
the snorting enemy near the camp at Broad-
meadows, and died on the spot. And then
William Mann was run Over by the ’bus
which he had abandoned while it was still
in motion. In every case the verdict was
death from misadventure. There is a ter-
rible lot of misadventure when a motor-’bus
service starts.
The Arts and Crafts’ Society is holding
a show of its goods in the Auditorium Build-
ing this week, and no one is forcibly pre-
vented from spending all his money there
instead of taking it to the races. The usual
pottery, painting, chip-carving and leather
work are available as Christmas presents or
parting gifts to the military. What, indeed,
could be more useful on active service than
a heavily-trimmed calendar, invaluable alike
as a penwiper, a doormat, a batli-towel or a
chest-protector?
From my Adelaide correspondent: —
Amongst our contributions to the Melbourne Cup
festivities are the Galways, Miss d’Erlanger and
Private Secretary Mulholland. They are to stay at
Federal Government House. Premier Peake is
another of our sacrifices in the good cause. He, of
course, merely goes to meet his brother-Premiers
and talk of the cursed lack of pence.
Mention of Lady Galway reminds me that she pre-
sided on Tuesday at a meeting to roll the Belgian
Relief Fund along. People get furiously excited over
these functions nowadays, there being nothing else
to get excited about. By four o’clock the Mayor’s
parlor was overflowing, and a move had to be made
to the main hall. Arrived there, the floodgates of con-
versation were unsealed, and the misfortunes of the
Belgians and the best means of relieving them were
canvassed with terrific vigor. As the outcome of it
all, the good old “monster” entertainment, with his-
torical and patriotic tableaux, was decided on. It is
to transpire in the Exhibition Hall.
Thursday’s Melbourne express brought us Major
and Mrs. Bruce (Mary Grant Bruce). They picked
up the Nestor at the Outer Harbor.
Died at Gawler on Friday, Sarah Duffield, daughter
of the late Walter Duffield, who came to the State in
’39 and established the Union and Victoria flourmills
eight years later. He sat in Parliament as member
for Barossa from 1857 till 1871, with a two years’
break, and was in the Hart and first Boucaut Minis-
tries. Miss Duffield was a sister of Mrs. Davies-
Thomas and Mrs. Makin and of Mr. Walter Duffield,
of Glenelg.
The Jay-Von Doussa wedding is to occur at Hahn-
dorf on November 14.
South Aus. Society of Arts has'elected, James
Ashton as president, replacing John White, who
has had the chair for three years. Ashton is the
veteran seascape painter, and father of Will. H. E.
Powell remains secretary. The society is getting
thoughtful about its annual winter exhibition. People
come, but don’t buy, preferring to wait for the inter-
state exhibition in November. The one held last
June showed a loss of £3O.
The row between the picturesque character
whom we ail know as “Lady Rupert” and
the other interesting person who is usually
called Mrs. George Gumming has advanced
another step. The latter has fired in a
claim for £lOOO assault-damages upon her
lady friend of other days, and another on
Mr! Cumming. A sort of field washing-day
of dirty linen is promised when the cases
come into court, if they ever do. But what
Melbourne is looking for with most eager-
ness is the settling of the ancient problem:
Is she or is she not?
Yours, till Johanna’s return, ;

INDIGESTION.
A GREAT SUFFERER DERIVED
RELIEF FROM DR. MORSE’S
INDIAN ROOT PILLS.
It is no new thing to find people who can
positively state that Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills relieve indigestion and stomach dis-
orders, aiding also in the digestion and assi-
milation of the food. It is a pretty generally
accepted fact among thousands of people
that this remedy is without equal as a
splendid cleansing and toning medicine. One
of the many who have proved their qualities
in this particular is Nurse Evlyn Nelson,
of Rozelle, who, as a nurse, is competent to
express an opinion, and she has kindly con-
sented to let her statement be published.
“I saw by advertisement,” writes Nurse
Evlyn Nelson, of 44 Belmore Street, Rozelle,
N.S.W., “that Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
were recommended for indigestion, and
decided to give them a trial, being a great
sufferer from that malady. It was so bad
that I could scarcely eat anything, and
frequently felt in the mornings pains be-
tween the shoulders, and had no disposition
to rise for my household duties until I
underwent a course of Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills. I can faithfully assert that I
have derived a great amount of benefit, and
have none of the former symptoms which
caused me so much trouble in the past. I
always keep them for use in case of need
and recommend them frequently to others.”*

POLITICAL
POINTS
BEGINNING TO DEC AY.
It was to be deplored that the old Liberal party—
the old Freetrade party—had lost its punch. —Joke
Carruthers, at a feed given to Conroy, ex-Federal
member.
FAT IMPORTER: “Poor old friend! You
ain't lookin' as well as you used to.”
The real explanation of the -.widen accept-
ance of the resignation of I ; ince Louis of
Battenberg (whose loyalty is undoubted)
may be found in the announc ;ment that John
Fisher gets the vacant job of First Sea Lord.
Louis is senior to Fisher, and the latter,
although reckoned Britain’s finest naval tac-
tician since Nelson, had no chance of pass-
ing him except over his offieially-dead corpse.
Practically everybody agreed that Fisher’s
hand ought to be at the helm, and Batten-
berg’s resignation opened the way.
In spite of its boast that it had nailed
Freetrade to the mast, Sydney Telegraph
seems to be wavering, too. The other morn-
ing it remarked: —
The application by Australia to London for a new
loan simply amounts to an order for the shipment of
more commodities.
From which this inference is to be drawn :
If we didn’t order foreign commodities we
wouldn’t need the loan. Which is to say, if
we made the goods ourselves our children
wouldn’t have to pay our lOU.
The clause added to Victoria’s Local Gov-
ernment Bill forbidding public bodies to use
foreign-made goods when Australian are
available, speedily showed what the typical
Bumble’s patriotism is worth. The Imperial-
ists of the Prahran Council proclaimed, as
soon as they got a chance, that the clause
“should be opposed.” As Pra’n’s Assembly
representative, Attorney-General Mackinnon,
had already accepted the clause for the Gov-
ernment, tiie motion was obviously aimed at
the Leg. Councillor for the district. The
Leg. Councillor is the great stand-by of the
anti-Australian. Which is one more reason
why the Leg. Councillor should go.
Vic. Ilailway Minister Mackinnon told a
Parliamentary querist the other day that the
Newport railway workshops had turned out
a number of motor transport waggons
for the army, and there were large
possibilities of heavy ordnance being made
there. For years past Australia has been
assured that it couldn’t possibly make this
and that. Now the war, by knocking away
the prop, has given Australia a chance to
show that the old story was the glozing lie
of interested foreign bagmen. The foreign
bagmen are, however, not dead ; they are only
sleeping while the war lasts, and unless Aus-
tralia claps on high duties they will presently
be just as active as ever.
The war has struck the Australian import-
ing party with a club on the lower button
of the weskit. The centre of the importing
party is Sydney. When the Sydney im-
porters got the Federal capital fixed at
Canberra, an inland place without coal or
water-power for manufacturing purposes, so
that it couldn’t start local industries to
compete against the import business of
Sydney, everything looked beautiful. Then
a - man was imported to build the Federal
capital, and plans for the capital were im-
ported. Also, foreign experts were engaged
to select the best plan. Now one of the
experts, being an Austrian, is engaged
shooting at the whole British Empire and
has no time to report on Canberra plans,
and the importing party doesn’t know what
to do.
“Pink Tape” reports a Service scare: —
N.S.W. Works Minister Griffith has again intro-
duced himself as dictator of the Public Service. Some
two years ago a couple of high officials in his De-
partment took presents from Government contractors.
Instead of sending their cases on to the Public Ser-
vice Board, Griffith inserted a laconic notice in the
Gazette dispensing with their services. The Board
thought hard, but didn’t speak, and all was peace
until, recently, three officers in the dredge service
were accused of drunkenness. Their cases were re-
ferred to the Board, which reprimanded and disrated
them. The Minister promptly issued another Gazette
notice announcing that the tipplers had been fired.
The Service has hitherto been content in the assur-
ance that the Board was its final judge, and that poli-
tical interference with the tribunal was not possible.
This proves to have been a mirage, and the Service
is again in gloom and uncertainty. The Board, for
its part, is not taking the rebuke lying down; and
the Service is rounding up its friends in Parliament
to ask Griffith to produce his charter as a High
Court or Privy Council.
The invaluable Knibbs reckons that on
August 31 slightly over one : tentli of the
unionists of Australia were out of work. This
is referred to as “the result of war on em-
ployment.” It is really the result of a fool-
tariff on employment. Up to August 31,1914,
Australia had as much money to spend as
usual. The failure of the wheat crops hadn’t
then affected anybody. The wheat cheques,
in any case, never come in till January and
February. All that had happened was that
vast quantities of stuff which foreigners
usually make for us hadn’t come to hand,
and, therefore, nobody could buy it. The
failure of the foreign competitor should have
given Australian manufacturers the time of
their lives; but in dozens of industries there
are no Australian manufacturers to have any
sort of life, good, bad or indifferent. So when
the imported stuff couldn’t, be delivered the
importer merely looked glum, and after that
the importer’s carrier looked glum, and then
the importer’s clerk and the carrier’s clerk
and the wharf-lumper and dozens of others.
A Federal measure just introduced raises
the authorised capital of the Commonwealth
Bank from £1.000,000 to £lO,OOO OOO—or
rather to £1,000,000 ordinary capital and
£9,000,000 worth of debentures. It also
gives the institution power to buy up othe
banks. Now which bank is yearning to sell
out? Don’t all speak at once.
P YJA MA PA TRIO TISM.
B INKS: “Great Scott! What the deuce"
MRS. BINKS: “ Take them off at once. Those aren’t yours. That's a pair I’ve been

Woman in Maoriland had glorious visions
for a few days lately. Constitutional re-
forms were under discussion, and the Reps.,
being quite willing to try it on the dog,
accepted a proposal that women should be
entitled to serve in the Leg. Council. But
the Council declined to be the dog, and
rejected the proposal on the plausible ground
that it should have originated with the dog.
THE WAITER.
(Apropos a recent announcement of Mr.
Fisher's.)
THE PATIENT HUNGRY ONE: “The menu
promises welt. Now it remains for the
goods to materialise !”
Minister of Home Affairs Archibald has
been to Canberra and is very pleased with
all he saw. Archibald comes from the sand-
wastes of Port Adelaide, and the dust heap of
Canberra made him feel quite at home.
The worst political story of the week is
that Andrew Fisher is going to postpone
the Tariff till after Christmas. If this is
true it is bad business. Everybody is howl-
ing to Australia to shoot Germany with the
silver bullet; but unless the Tariff is fixed
satisfactorily there will be no silver bullet
available —the country will be unable to
afford the costly ammunition. While the
war is on is the time to start manufactures
and extend those already in existence; but
no fresh industries will come into being and
no old ones are likely to extend till higher
duties are assured. There must be security
of investment. Without a proper Tariff no
one is going to sink hundreds of thousands
of pounds in factories and plants and in
training and organisation, to have them
knocked out in 'the first round by cheap
German and Austrian labor immediately
the war ends.
The half-Protectionists who cry for High
Preference on British goods don t like Sena-
tor O’Keefe’s straight-out views of the paia-
mount duty to Australia. Said lie-
There seemed danger in extending any preference
to Great Britain which might be of advantage to that
country, as if we did so our industrial conditions
must sink to the English level, which was dreadful.
He was a British subject, but recognised that Great
Britain was a land of shameful poverty.
The dying Freetraders of Australia are using
the Motherland to make Protection practi-
cally inoperative, and O’Keefe s warning
doesn’t come too soon.
The last time the N.S.W. State debt was
seen alive, which was one day last week, it
amounted to £116,693,031, apart from casual
overdrafts. The Wheat-growing Government
has £2,500,000 falling due this month, and
another £4,600,000 or so before the end of
next May. It is a pleasant prospect for the
Wheat-growing Ministry.
The latest figures supplied by Common-
wealth statistician Ivnibbs show that 16,859
persons were affected by 83 industrial dis-
putes during the second quarter of this
year. They lost altogether 306,395 working
days and wages amounting to £156,415. The
wages lost in the first quarter of the year
were £130,392. That is the “strike” side
of the picture. During the two quarters 121
awards and industrial agreements benefited
49,373 workers to the extent of £13,327
weekly, or £173,251 per quarter. That’s
the “Arbitration” side of the same picture.
Which of them is Labor going to turn to the
wall?
A small disturbance that is raising a lot of
dust: —•
The L’Estrange case, over which there is war in
the N.S.W. Labor camp, is likely to have some far-
reaching consequences. Harry L’Estrange came into
prominence in connection with the Rabbit Trappers’
Union, and has been in the swim ever since. For
some reason he became unpopular with the officials
of the big A.W.U., into which the rabbit-trappers
merged; but that unpopularity made him popular
with the Holman faction. When trouble occurred im
the country over the handling of “black” chaff
L’Estrange is alleged to have urged the men to what
was said to be Holman’s view, viz., that they should
handle it. This gave the A.W.U. an apportunity to
denounce him; but L’Estrange made a declaration
denying most of the things alleged. On this, in spite
of the fact that he had been selected as a Labor
candidate for a Federal seat, a charge of loose swear-
ing was laid against L’Estrange, who was committed
for trial. The charge, although it came -just before
the election, did not injure his hopes. He had no
chance of winning, and knew it. The trial that was
to be did not transpire, because Minister for Justice
Hall, after inquiry, decided that a prosecution was
not justified. The bitter remarks made by The
Worker (N.S.W.) on this decision have produced a
writ demanding £5OOO damages; and the two hostile
sections of the Labor crowd, which had managed to
disguise their unfriendliness for some time, are now
breathing hard at one another. One outcome of it
all is that if Premier Holman shows any lukewarm-
ness on the next Referendum (probably not far off)
his connection with L’Estrange and the “black” chafif.?
will be used in an effort to push him out of Mie
Labor movement. It seems a paltry reason wtfien
there are so many more damning ones handy.
THE TARDY AWAKENING OF SAIREY GAMP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The present Government, despite its early pro-
testations of horror at the very thought of borrowing,
has pledged the State’s credit to an extent that
easily eclipses all its predecessors. Last year tlie
State Government broke all records by spending over
eight millions. It not only raised money in London
and locally as fast as it was able. It also indulged in
a system of spending money in anticipation of loans,
it being enabled to carry out this dubious pi actice
by a skilful manipulation of its accounts at its
bankers. — S. M. Herald.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
So far. this season’s cricket in Adelaide
has suffered from an unprecedented scarcity of mois-
ture. The opening round was chiefly notable for 103
made by Gordon Campbell (who was to have been a
wicketkeeper in ihe S’African tour) and fine bowling
by Whitty, whose threatened knee is evidently
sound again. He took five wickets for 43 and seven
for 25. Old Joe Travers, still dangerous in club
cricket, had six for 32. * #
Wicket-keeping is far from being a dolcc
far niente life when A. Cotter is heaving the leather.
On Saturday, at Sydney, he outed stumpers Buckle
and Taylor, besides smashing the middle stick to
toothpicks. Provided he retains his form, Cotter
should render good assistance to the Ma State Xl—
if he can contrive to bang something besides Ma’s
own wicketkeepers.
What Lemburg was to the Austrians, the
end of the Third ltound of Sydney First-Grade
Cricket was to Gordon. It had piled up 268 against
l' diversity the previous Saturday, and had then
failed to take any wickets for 70 runs. Macartney
and Scott were bowling, and for a time maintained
an ascendancy. But Barbour broke loose and lifted
his score to 181, and Farrar backed him up with a
good working 40. Then Gregg got loose and banged
till 152 appeared opposite his name. Consider the
fall of the wickets: 96, 108, 339, 413, 432, 455, 496
—now for the tail—499, 512, 512. It was enough,
and Gordon was outed by 244 on the first innings.
Balmain put up a great struggle against North
Sydney, which had left 328 on the board. The
fortune fluctuated for a while; then Folkard, the
reliable veteran, smacked 98 (including 12 fours
and one six), and gave his side a decided chance.
But time ran out when nine wickets had fallen for
326, and robbed Balmain of its victory, and North
Sydney was mighty lucky to escape with a drawn
game. When Petersham went up against Central
Cumberland it did not regard the latter’s 251 as a
formidable score. All the same, a rot fell upon it,
and the side collapsed. Strange smashed six wickets
for 41 runs and Pye three for 28. Only four men
succeeded in making double figures, and the side
perished for 124. When the fourth wicket fell the
score was 102 —and the 10th went for 124. In the
follow-on six fell for 116, Cranney taking three for
26 So Petersham was lucky to evade a first-in-
nings defeat by 127, as when stumps were drawn its
combined scores left it 11 to the bad. Glebe, hav-
ing idled up 296 the previous Saturday proceeded
to smash up Middle Harbor’s batsmen, and succeeded
in dishing the lot for 207. Then it started on the
second innings and smacked 112 for six wickets;
but this had no bearing on the game. Glebe won
on the first clash by 89. The destroying angel on
the winner’s side was Kelleway, who took five for
46, well supported by Cotter, with four tor 06.
Sydney had dismissed Waverley for 181 and accu-
mulated 60 for four wickets. Then it proceeded to
the woods, or, as some authorities have it, the
races, and vanished for 159. So it lost the game
by 22 On the first innings. Redfern had put up 226
for five wickets. When Goddard reached Ins century
(he was caught at 103) the Redfern captain closed
with 262 for six wickets, and essayed to put Pad-
dington through the honemill. Mailev’s bowling was
deadly, and he alone bagged six for 53 ; but one
way and another the side managed to prolong the
first innings through the breathless afternoon, and
finally vanished on time for 120.
As regards the competition. Central Cumberland
heads the list with one outright win, one first-
innings victory and one drawn game—a percentage
of 72.22. North Sydney is next with one outright
win and two draws, 66.06 per cent. University with
two first-innings victories and one drawn game holds
the third kev, with 61.11.

Maoriland Cricket Association’s committee
resigned in a body the other day because of a row
over the paying of the players that formed the
Maoriland team seen in Australia last season. There
was a loss on the tour, and as the various Provincial
Associations had to foot the bill there was a howl
about the amount handed to the plavers as wages.
The committee thereupon mounted its Dignity, and
from that exalted position handed in its resignation.
* * * *
The Federal Cycling Council has annar-
entlv got on its feet again, as Victoria, N.S.W.,
S.A., Westralia, Tasmania and Maoriland have signed
the reciprocity agreement. This binds them to
recognise and enforce each other’s penalities.
At present N. S. Wales has four styles of
hoofball to amuse itself with, to wit, Union Rugby,
League Rugby, Soccer and Australian. The object of
a conference, to be held in Melbourne shortly, is to
amalgamate the Rugby League and the Australian
code; and if the amalgamation comes off. Union
Rugby and Soccer will soon feel the point of a very
sharp knife indeed.
Policemen W. .T. O’Reilly and C. T.
Ferguson shattered two records at South Sydney
Sports gathering on Saturday. In the 161 b. hammer
handicap O’Reilly (from scratch) hurled the missile
138 ft. Him, or 20jin. more than his own State re-
cord • while Ferguson threw the javelin 133 ft. 9fin.
—sft. sJin. in advance of the State’s best figures.
Both are handy Johns to have on your side when
things require shifting.
Cyclist R. K. Lewis, wlio recently crossed
the narrow stream between amateurism and profes-
sionalism, showed fine form in gathering the five-mile
scratch race at the Sydney Eight-hour snorts last
week. The best 20 nedallers in the State were in
the struggle, and as the five miles were spun past in
the fast time of llmin 5 4-ssec., pace was crowded
on all the way. The minor places in the rush were
filled by E. Priestley and L. Hammond. #
“Billy” Hill, secretary of the Sydney
Rugby Union, is a combination of demigod and
wizard, in the estimation of Yankee University foot-
ballers. For two seasons Hill umpired the Stanford
versus California University matches, but declined the
offer to make the trip this year, whereupon the
Yankees cabled to know if a local umpire was capable
of handling the game. The flabbergasted Hill replied
he had no knowledge of the local men s qualifications,
and could express no opinion. Probably Hill. hopes
to make another trip across the pond, and iiad no
intention of endorsing somebody in the opposing
camp—which was horse-sense.

Paddon, the Australian, defeated by Barry
on the Thames for the world’s sculling championship,
complains that the volume of traffic on that course is
so enormous that it is practically impossible to get
an uninterrupted run, as it is understood on the
Parramatta. Also, the roughness of the water, owing
to a stiff breeze, was doubled by the thresh of heavy
steamers just before starting time. These conditions
suited Barry, and didn’t suit Paddon. Anyhow, that’s
Paddon’s view of it, and if Barry feels inclined to
prove him wrong, there’s the placid Parramatta
waiting for the experiment.
Anyhow, Paddon did very well indeed, and finished
onlv 2sec. behind Barry, although the latter covered
the distance in record time; and Barry, moreover,
was accustomed to the Thames and its traffic.
Paddon would like to have another match, but lie
flatly refuses to row under similar conditions. tie
wants to race under those that apply on the Parra-
matta —two hours before high tide, and over a
course cleared of traffic one hour before the race.
But whether Barry will come to Australia is very
doubtful. :k *
When the British army landed in France
its motor equipment consisted of about 1000 vehicles
.—fast cars for the generals and staff ; hundreds of
motor-cycles for scouting and despatch carrying,
lorries and vans for moving supplies, ammunition,
and, on occasion, troops themselves. There were
motor ambulances and special machines for aeroplane
transport. But the most staggering item was the
squadron of motor repair-shops and the wireless cars.
The moving smithies are fitted with forges, lathes,
mechanical hammers and the whole plant of an
armorer’s repair shop. They. rage over the battle-
field, gathering smashed machine guns and rendering
damaged cannon fit for fresh service. It was the
splendid motor transit that enabled the British force
to avoid a decisive engagement with overwhelming
German forces in the long retirement from Mods to
within sight of the forts of Paris. It was motor
equipment that enabled the forces to walk out and
leave Antwerp an empty shell. It is motor equip-
ment that enables the British to keep the men at
the front well fed and strong. All of which has a
special significance to Australians. If ever we have
to fight in this country our vast distances will give
a tremendous advantage to whichever side lias com-
mand of the superior motor service—provided the
reads are in decent order.
McLoughlin, who, by defeating Brookes
and Wilding in the Davis Cup contest, was proudly
dubbed by America as singles champion of the
world, has, to everybody’s astonishment, lost the
championship of U.S.A., being beaten three straight
sets by Williams. The latter lost to both Brookes and
Wilding in the Davis Cun games, and should have
been soft stuff for McLoughlin.
STOREECK-DOYLE AT SYDNEY
STADIUM.
Both get a tired feeling towards the end.
The Motor Yacht Club of N.S.W. will
open its season on November 14 with a procession to
Middle Harbor, where a landing* will be effected and
revels indulged in under the greenwood tree. A
reminder of the fact that this country is at war hit
the club in the eye when it discovered that it was
necessary to obtain the consent of the military
authorities to take their launches to either Middle
Harbor or Manly Beach, and consent was given con-
ditionally that the club burgee was flown and only
the western channel used.

That fortunate 18-footer, H. C. Press,
scored another victory on Saturday in the Sydney
Sailing Club's 18-foot handicap. What had promised
to be a good nor’-west" working breeze faded away
altogether; then, veering round, it re-appeared from
the north-east, and gave its final demonstration in a
series of dying puffs from due north. Mona, Quibree
and Press managed to catch a hurrying baby squall
which missed the rest of the fleet, and so got a
break. It was not long before Press got to the
front, and, once there, was never threatened, Winning
by !)osec. from Arline, with, Golding a close third.
All the same, but for trouble with the extras, Arline
would have got home first. While Press was shaking-
out a ringtail Arline’s spinnaker carried away, and
destroyed its chance of overtaking the winner.
The Motor Cycle Club of N.S.W. experi-
enced a shock last week when secretary J. A. Fair
resigned. The general query was “Whaffor?” He
will be missed. He was a good organiser, and during
his three years of office had raised the club from a
mere skeleton to a powerful body of over 300
members. , #
“J.N.”: You miss the point. The only
question is whether, for ordinary purposes, a man
i eeds a high-powered engine. This paper’s view was
that such an engine is rarely called for. When it is
called for the Indian is among the best, safest and
most trustworthy—its records sufficiently prove that.

“K.0.M.”: I see that Langford outed
Colin Beil at Boston the other day “h*®” rounds.
The United States papers referred to Bell as tne auo-
ralian champion heavyweight I don't know whether
Bell lays claim to that title, or whether it has
been thrust upon him—more probabiy the lattei
Papers this end rake up the record of Bells previous
encounter with Langford at Rockhampton two years
a«>*o when a 15-round draw: was declared. As a
witter of fact, that fight was billed for la rounds,
"nd Langford had to adopt all sorts of dodges to
avoid knocking Bell oot. At the end of the bout the
referee declared that he couldn’t separate the men,
and asked them to box another round Langtoid
looked at the referee for a few seconds to see it lie
meant it, muttered “Gorblime, and then crawled
through the ropes. The referees silence was volu-
mi nous. * *
The hungriest boxer Australia has seen
of late years was Milburn Saylor, who was anxious to
fight every Saturday night ; and we thought him a
glutton. 'But the Yankee-Jewish scrapper Levinsky
outranges him altogether, and m New York recently
fought two nights in succession. He had a sine
wager of $2OO on the second fight and nothing on the
first so he put up a wearisome display in the first,
galloping like a racehorse out of the firing line, so
that he would not get punished in such a way as to
make him stiff, and merely tapping his adversary for
fear of damaging his hands. The critics fell on him,
and gave him such a clawing that when the second
battle eventuated the two fighters and the promoter
discovered they had less than £l4O to pay exes with
and divide. Levinsky fought over 200 rounds between
New Year and September, and is anxious to double it
bv the end of the year. Whether jthe suffering public
will he anxious to watch Levinsky is another pre-
position. # *
Harry Stone, who ran a brilliant rig in
Australia, is back in the United States, and raging
round to secure a battle with 1 reddie M elsh for the
lightweight championship of the world. His ambi-
tion soars high; lie aspires, not only to the light-
weight championship, but also to the welterweight.
In fact he has claimed the title and announced ins
readiness fo defend it. Another recent visitor who is
after the scalp of Freddie Welsh is Milburn Saylor,
and Ray Bronson had opened negotiations with the
English champion before the party left Australia.
Next Saturday night at Sydney Stadium
will he a time of sustained fury and considerable
speed, for the Maitland smasher, Les Darcy, will
collide with the equally hard-hitting Yankee, Dus
Christie —lie who demolished Marchand so briefly.
Both are stubborn fighters, and can wage an uphill
battle, though it’s odds-on the game doesnt last
20 rounds. Darcy continues to receive tuition from
Dave Smith, and his mentor declares by his halidom
that the vouth has improved for this battle just as
he did for his last. If this is true, then Darcy is
just about at his pinnacle. The question is, ot
course, has Dave Smith managed to instil levelheaded-
ness and self-control into him ? #
This war is opening our eyes. It seems .
now that, when we try, we can even make playing
cards in Australia. Jonas & Co., a Bathurst-street
(Sydney) firm, have got into the business, and send
a sample pack quite good enough to lose a sheep-
station with. # *
“Arow tomanier” : Re the origin of the
“crawl stroke,” which swimmer Cavill seems to
claim to have originated. It comes from the
Raviana lagoon, in the Solomon Islands. Natives
from there swam in public in Sydney as much as U
years ago, practising the “Raviana crawl ’ stroke
precisely as it is seen to-day. Harry Wickham used
the “crawl” before Alick made his appearance, and
long before .Cavill invented anything. .
“Old Sport*): After the Caulfield Cup the
most dunderheaded" punter should he convinced that
the time is ripe for the Tote. With another tool 1
charged the ranks- of Jewry to secure a fair price
about Uncle Sam., and was offered 7 to 2. In a held
of 19 three horses were quoted at less than 4 to 1
against. Anna Carlovna and St. Carwyne were avail-
able at threes and Uncle Sam at 7 to 2. In sheer
desperation I decided to back a rough- un, Coat o
Mail (100 to 1, vide Monday’s press), and was
offered 15 to 1. After telling O’lsrael my'opinion
of his ancestors I was gravely informed fiat the
moke was well backed with him, hut as a iavor lie
would lay me 20’s. It might have been possible to
better these figures in the paddock, hut the poor
half-crown punter on the flat gets it in the neck
ever y time. Again, in the Windsor Handicap sciam-
Die over six furlongs, Traquette, in a field of 15,
including some of our best sprinters, was quoted at
six to four right through. The punter is a fatuous
animal. . # *
Some of the long-overdue rain arrived at
Flemi ngton on Derby Day, and the course* having
previously been profusely watered by human agency,
Legan to soften after the first race —the Maiden
Plate—which Hush Money won in the proverbial

ingly. 'the season’s champion two-year-old has je
come along and eclipse this early form.
When a vv.f.a race is reckoned “a good thing for
one’’ several outsiders are at least supposed to have
chances • but when it is universally talked of as a
SSTJSL’S*" the took., m„.t m,
e «t to get backers for anything else. ( )utsicie oi
Mountain lvnight and Woorak nothing was leall
fancied for the V.R.O. Derby bv punters in general.
The local horses, Traquette, Burrabadeen and b nlelio,
were backed, on the off chance, at shorter puces th.
Cirlita Giru and others, but not one ot them was
thought to have a 6 to 1 chance of beating eithei ot
the favorites. Burrabadeen, with no form to recom-
meml it, was backed at 16 to 1 became ‘t was an
acceptor for the Melbourne Cup, whereas Ansiaeus,
who P also had accepted for the big handicap, went out
at 100 to I—the extreme outsider ot the paicy.
If the Derby race was “untrue" —in a turf way
of speaking—the drizzling rain and muddy goin„
were responsible for the untruth fulness Butthe
time—2min. 37-Jsec.—was quite up to the average
for all weathers, and nobody could say that the AM
wanted a pacemaker. Woorak staited off like g
possessed of seven devils. He was in a bad nooc ,
or the keep-to-tlie-left order ot running didn t suit
thefiery chestnut. Anyhow, he ran wide at the
first turn as though trying to bolt back to the In 1
cage, and had to be whipped to keep him
Meanwhile Carlita was running absolutely last At
the end of a mile Woorak was still in the lead, but
Carlita had worked up to his girths, and Mounta
Knight came close after them. Then Mountain Knight
dropped out of the struggle, and Carlita aiid Giru
passed the spent pacemaker l mally, when Cail ta
appeared to be winning easily, Anstaeus came v
a late rush and beat Giru. On this form the late
comer promised to be busy at the end oi Meloouine
Cup, if a fist. 71b. boy could rule him ioi all he is
worth.
The case against Carlita previous to the Derby,
was that the daughter of Charlemagne 11. had pa
formed like a non-stayer. She won the Rosehill
Guineas (seven furlongs), but was unplaced to
Woorak in the Chelmsford Stakes (nine hjil“n»o .
she failed in the A.J.C. Derby, and came only third
to Garlin in the Clibhom Stakes (nine tuHongs), but
won the Grantham Stakes (one m e) at. the Mine
meeting, when the going was dull. lhe filly is
nothing wonderful, but she can go fur »-
2min. 37-isec. on the Flemington course under Dei by-
weight. Which was good enough to win last Satur
day. ....-•
Melbourne Stakes result was a repetition of the
,\JC. Spring Stakes surprise. Cagou, Lilyveil and
Posinatus were much preferred to -St. at
wf a but the sturdy St. Alwyne horse beat them
more’easily than before. Lilyveil this time finished
last instead of second. It seems, deal that St.
Carwyne is a good weight carrier, whereas with Cal-
linan and 7st. odd on liis back in th e. Metropolitan
and Caulfield Cup he couldn’t get neaiei than thiul
in each race.
The fact that Ulva’s Isle had been scratched for
his Melbourne Stakes engagement after o
the ground seemed to convince the books that the
long-time favorite for the Cup had gone amiss. Before
they took up their bags and walked they were offering
10 to 1 against Hulva’s Ilile—a longer price than
they would lay three months ago.
Three favorites won at Flemington on Derby day !
Their starting prices were 10 to 0, 2 .to X, and 6to 4.
The other three winners started at 20 tod, -0
and 15 to 1. and in the cases ot Oarhta for the
Derbv and Rupert Clarke s 1 ncle Matt. tor me

Jockey “Bobby” Lewis has a piebald
record in the V.R.O. and Cup. In the former he has

The Melbourne Cup resulted in the usual

their cash on the favorite can get some eonsohitio i

The aftermath of the visit of the Yankee
athletes is a loud howl from the keepers of the
treasuries. N.S.W. Amateur Athletic Ass. has been

Sam’s sons departed in a blaze ot glory. - Now Au

Considering the trail of debt the Yankee visit left
behind Australia will snort at any future proposed
incursions—unless the invading athletes put up a
substantial guarantee; It should have snorted before.

N S.W. Cricket Association’s Ling-
promised determination to protect the pitchesagains
storm during inter-Stflte - matches will be pfit into
effect this season. The covering, however, will pro-
tect onlv 18ft. by 12ft. at both ends of the wicket,
or iust sufficient to enable the batsmen to keep dry
?eet and the bowlers to get. a grip ere they let fly
the instrument of war. The innovation is expected to
infuse a spark into the game—and, come to think
of it, the game wants a spark very urgently.^
When “Cyclone” Johnny Thompson fougbt

richer bv three figures than when he entered the
ring? Either Johnpy lias lost Ins magnetism or the

LEARN TO FIGHT YODR
WAY OUT OF A SCRAPE
dfd
Equip yourself with a knowledge of Scientific Boxing, so that,
when you are set upon (and it will surely happen, sooner or
later), you’ll be able to convincingly assert yourself as a real
man should.
The usual type of “bully” generally relies on “bluff” and
brute strength. He’s a hot headed individual, whose temper
ALWAYS gets the upper hand.
That is to say, he’s just the type that would get a sound
drubbing from the man who knows how to use his hands
properly.
I can teach you how you can use your hands to best possible
advantage—and can teach you in your own home.

and explain every serviceable move so
thoroughly that you’ll quickly become a
“snag.”
There is a splendid variety of “moves,”
Every serviceable “hit” and “stop” is in-
cluded in my Postal Course; perhaps more
than you’ll ever need. But, then, the founda-
tion of my instruction is to make you fully

You ought to know how to defend your-

more thoroughly than by learning to box.
It will give you an advantage—an advan-

With one of the world's biggest coalfields
at its back door, and with a practicable ppi t
at the front, Newcastle, which is fairly brisk
as it is, will be three times brisker when
Australia decides to give itself the wages
and the profits with which it has hitherto
been feeding the foreigner. Already the
B. H. Prop. Co.’s iron and steel furnaces are
uearly ready to be blown in theie, and this
and other factories will not only help to push
up land values, but will make the hitherto
unproductive vacant allotment bring in a
little besides municipal rate and land-tax
notices. And by the look of things the
Newcastle B. and I. has more than one ot
these allotments on hand. The property
item, as this table shows, is very consider-
able :

From the foreclosed and other property, just
a little short of £lOO,OOO worth, the total net
rent for last year was only £5272, wlncli
seems to indicate either that properties are
overvalued, or that there is much unproduc-
tive land in the heap. If things turn out as
they promise, the co. should be better able to
dispose of this stuff.
The reserves in the table arc made up of
Contingency Reserve £34,055, Reserve bund
£13,000, and P. and L. Balance £1754. Ihe
£1042 mentioned in the last line of the table
has been written off the Contingency Reserve.
This is the explanation. When the co. woke
and found itself in the gutter on the Morning
After, with a sheaf of inflated securities in
hand, it didn’t write them down as most of
the other victims did. Thus far it had
been the Newcastle Permanent Investment
and Building Society; to begin with it de-
cided that it was more or less of a liar, and
cut out the “Permanent.” Capital was then
written off and transferred to a Contingency
Reserve. Now, when sales are made at
less than book value, the deficiency is written
off this reserve —which is, by the way, in-
cluded in the reserves shown in the tab'e.
The co. owes £50,231 to depositors, and all
other liabilities amount to £519. Total debts,
£50,750. Against that there are £4756 m
cash, £96,971 in advances, ‘and £94,363 in
properties. Depositors are therefore quite
safe. The assets look pretty good. For
instance, in 1900, foreclosed properties were
in the books at £lOl 252, and the Contin-
gency Reserve was £42.510. Now, although
upwards of £60,000 of the properties _ have
been disposed of, the Reserve is still as
much as £34,055. This indicates that things
are not nearly so bad as was at first imag-
ined, and suggests that properties don’t stand
at much above their real value. It is ot
course impossible to appraise the advances;
but in ordinary circumstances they should be
a better lot even than the foreclosed securi-
ties. All this being so, things are very com-
fortable for the shareholders as well as for
the depositors. #

This little concern, which has always limited
its risks to its own money, save for a tem-
porary overdraft, has, if anything, made
itself safer and snugger in the past 12
months. At September, 1913, capital was
£10,944, advances £13,081, and cash in hand
nil. Now, capital stands at £11,475, while
advances have been reduced to £12,282, and
there is £322 of cash. Evidently the manage-
ment has beeii going very slow in the matter
of new loans. Hence it has been in a posi-
tion to wipe out the overdraft of £1039; and
other liabilities have descended from £33 to
a mere half-crown. Income has, neverthe-
less, increased from £922 to £940 —a larger
profit with smaller risks. It is a cheerful
position, made all the more cheerful because,
on present appearances, Queensland isn’t
going to witness any sudden and serious
slump in either property values or employ-
ment; and this means that the co. shouldn’t
have much unpaid interest, or many secur-
ities thrown on its hands.
Westralia’s gold dividends for September
amounted to £104,534; total for nine months.
£613,326. There were 14 on the list, and
three of these (Great Boulder, Ivanhoe and
Kalgurli) paid out nearly two-thirds of the
lot. * * *
Ivanhoe (W.A.) has got its shaft down to
3200 ft., or about 200 ft. above the point
where geologist Maclaren reckoned the
porphyry intrusion, which lias so im-
poverished the main-ore shoot in the last
three or four levels, would pass away. At
present rate of sinking the remaining 200 ft.
should be completed in five or six months.
Maclaren could see no reason why the lode
should not become payable again after
getting through the porphyry. On the
other hand, it has to be remembered that all
Kalgoorlie mines get poorer in deep ground.

One reason why the Victorian railways
don’t pay as well as they should is that the
system is burdened with 48 miles of disused
lines. The cost of -the ancient dereliction
comes to £392,741. Furthermore, the State
lias spent £389,687 on surveys for lines which
were never built. That £782,428 was bor-
rowed, of course, and the interest-bill recurs
with the utmost precision. It will still be
recurring when the old tracks are submerged
by grass and gum-trees. For the settling of
a debt of this foolishness and magnitude is
a job that every State Treasurer abhors.
Poor Belgium! Whilst the old clothes of
the whole wide world are being collected for
its suffering people, a Sydney vendor of men’s
duds is exhibiting a number of battlefield
photographs, one of which shows a pile of
dead Belgian heroes. Under each picture is
the usually explanatory type, and neatly
tacked on is the rag ghoul’s advt. of his
own imperishable extra pants and the socks
that wear for all eternity. If it is a fair
thing to silence a German band for being in-
judiciously patriotic in a public place, it
seems a fair thing to prohibit the use of dead
allies as an advertising medium.
Engine 922, turned out of the Eveleigh
(Sydney) Loco, shops in January, 1911,
went back to the sheds the other day for its
first overhaul, having completed 152,399
miles without requiring a complete clean up.
The average mileage run by engines before
a general overhaul is necessary is 40,000
miles, so this made-in-Australia article has
established a record which knocks flat that
of the foreign goods made by Private Enter-
prise in distant workshops and dragged at
great expense across the world and landed in
the presence of unemployed Australian work-
men.

“Hamer” : Australia has beeu building up
a substantial wine business with Britain;
and the Anglo-Portuguese commercial
treaty, signed on August 13, is likely to give
it a little bit of a bump. That treaty pro-
vides that only a wine made in Portugal can
in future be sold in Britain as “port”; so
Australia will have to look for another name
as far as Britain is concerned, for the liquor
it usually sells under that well-known trade
term. Perhaps it might be called Port Jack-
son, or Port Phillip, or Port Darwin, or Port
Adelaide. Incidentally, there is no place in
Portugal called Port. The blessed spot is
Oporto.
“Madeiudus”: Since Reason’s departure
from Europe building plaster has risen in
price and will continue its way up. as the
bulk of it comes from Sharmany. In The
Bulletin, times out of number, writers
have spoken of the gypsum deposits in the
Victorian mallee. For over four years a
co. in Melbourne has been making this
mineral into builders’ plaster, and for the
last 18 months has had on the market an
article equal to the world’s best, at a price
20 per cent, less than you must pay for
imported. Yet architects and builders
are mostly astounded when an Aus-
tralian-made plaster is mentioned. Same
thing with the paints that an Aus-
tralian firm sends out from its fac-
tory. Up to now, so far as I know, only
one large building in all the Commonwealth
has had Australian-made paints specified
for it. I use both plaster and paint, and
buy only the unadulterated Australian-made
article when I have the say. And I battle
for the say because I do better work with
the home-made goods and save money in
buying them. When live, earnest salesmen
push the native-born lines as they should be
pushed, the goods won’t have to be
smuggled on to the job early in the morning,
and the average Australian architect will
leave off grovelling to the imported goods.
With delicate but unconscious sarcasm,
Sydney Telegraph printed the report ot the
Necessary Commodities Commission on the
gas companies’ increased charges side by
side with some photographs of the guns
employed to bring down Zeppelins—the tat
gas-pirates of the air. On present appear-
ances a Commission is a poor substitute loi
a gun.*
The great Yankee commercial raid is even
now begun. The National Union of Manu-
facturers has - chartered a huge steamei,
which has been fitted up as a travelling expo-
sition. It will be manned by a regiment of
picked bagmen and salesmen, and every Aus-
tralian capital will be visited, and the ship
thrown open, free of charge, to the public.
While the public gaze the bagmen will get
loose in the city and endeavor to establish
agencies and book orders. The Yankee view
is logical enough. He remarks to himself:
“Here are 17.000,000 men withdrawn from
Europe’s industries. Therefore Europe can-
not export much. These Australians are such
flaming idiots that they will always import
if they can, so now is the time to break
’em up with the magnificence of our manu-
facturing resources, and collar the market
before the local manufacturer can get going
—and then he never will get going.” Mean-
while there is no United States army help-
ing the Belgians to belt the invaders out of
their country or giving the Russians a lift
on the long, muddy, terrible road to Berlin.
LAGER BIER AND OLD OCTOBER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Lokal-Axzeiger states that the Kaisei in con
gratulating a Bavarian army corps, said: 1 b “) Ucl
like the English to meet the Bavarians just^once.^
Wilhelm, the War-Lord, much desires a meeting
Between his bold Bavarians, in array,
And “the contemptible English,” false and fleeting -
Ach, Ilimmel! speed the day!
With burning ardor, Wilhelm, who despises
Mere French and Russians, begs a simple boon;
Hark! from his pious lips a prayer rises
Ach, Gott ! let it be soon !
By Danube, Rhine and Main, Lech, Inn and Iser,
The bold Bavarians dwell, and brew their beer ;
Lager, both dark and light. And what is nicer
The German heart to cheer ?
The miserable English—rarely sober,
And very cowardly, if the truth be told —
Also brew beer, strong ale made in October—
The which they love, when old.
Potztausendl But those amiable Bavarians
Grow barley and good hops, and mix them well,
Making a bier too light for these barbarians
Who in The Island dwell.
lienee comes it that, in Swabia and Franconia,
The bold Bavarians drink their gallons free ;
Defying diabetes and pneumonia.
They lap it up like tea!
Yea, each Bavarian’s abdominal cavity
Daily is filled with palatable, light
Bier of negligible specific gravity—
A bier that can hardly fight.
Whereas the hateful Englanders, unsober,
Swallow mere pints of ale both old and bitter,
Triple-brewed, mellow is that old October —
To fhjht on there’s naught fitter!
So, when the War-Lord’s fervent prayer is granted,
And BEER meets bier upon the stricken bar,
His bold Bavarians will be so enchanted,
They won't know where they a -, e!
As pints to gallons, so those Island drinkers
In bulk to Bold Bavarians, in array—
Plus Wurtembergers and great Prussian thinkers —
But oh! it will be gay !
And at the Bar of Battle, where strong spirits
Are plenteous, and the drinkers not a few,
Wilhelm the War-Lord yet shall taste the merits
Of our October brew.

We are Literally Giving
A Partial List of Sample Values—
There are over 40 in all.
Lot No. SllO. —Bh.p. Ruston
and Proctor Portable Steam En-
gine. Quite recently “rebuilt” and 801 b.
working pressure granted by Government In-
spector. Worth every penny of £2OO, but if
you’re quick it’s vours for £129.
Lot No. 0827.—20h.p. “1.H.C.”
Mogul Gaso-Kero Tractor. Fully
equipped,-, ready to run with the following
accessories:—Bosch Magneto, Friction Clutch
Pulley, Kerosene Burning Attachment, Fuel
and Cooling Tanks, and all necessary connec-
tions therefor. Has done very little work
and is in splendid condition —just rebuilt and
fitted with Bosch Rotary Magneto. This engine
will run on a full load, using petrolite low-
grade kerosene for less than half what it
usually costs using some of the higher-grade
fuels, such as benzine, naphtha, etc. A Better
Bargain we’ve never known of. Worth every
“pound note” of £425, but as we must have
warehouse room it's offered now at £335.
Lot No. 0713.—Gh.p. Crossley
Horizontal Stationary Oil Engine.
The former owner of this engine, having work
for a larger size of the portable type, replaced
it with a 15h.p. “1.H.C.” Completely equipped
ready to run, and worth fully £6s—it must
be moved, and now goes for £42.
Lot No. Sill.—l3li.p. Buffalo
Single Cylinder Traction Steam
Engine. Fitted with grates suitable for
burning either wood or coal, and equipped
with 30 feet suction hose and awning. Re-
placed by its former owner with a 45h.p.
“1.H.C.,” and since coming back to us has
been overhauled and is now all ready for
work. A Tremendous Bargain—fully £225
worth of Tractive Power for £l3B.
Lot No. 0833.—0h.p. Newton
Stationar y Kerosene Engine.
Kquipped ready to run, with Lamp, Pulley,
Fuel and Cooling Tanks and all necessary con-
nections therefor. Has been thoroughly over-
hauled and “rebuilt,” and now is in good
order throughout. Worth £BO, void's for £53.
Lot No. 0710.—4h.p. “1.H.C.”
Hopper Cooled Gasoline Hori-
zontal Portable Engine, is equipped
with all latest fittings, including Friction
Clutch Pulley and Magneto. Has had only
one month’s demonstrative use, and is natur-
ally almost equal to new. If you don't leave
it too long you’ve a chance of securing this
£7O worth for £54 —but you must be quid;.
Lot No. 5504.—14h.p. Buffalo
Double Cylinder Traction Steam
Engine. Fitted with Grates suitable for
burning either wood or coal, and equipped
with 30ft. Suction Hose, Steel Main Gear,
Awning, 100-gallon Tank and Winding Drum.
This plant has done less than two years’ work,
and, after being recently “rebuilt,” was tested
by Government Inspector, who granted 1201 b.
as a safe working pressure. If you’re after
Tractive Power, and you fail to investigate
this engine, you’re passing a positive bargain.
Worth every “coin” of £440,' but the first
order will be written at £365.
And about 40 more, all kinds and
sizes, at equally low prices.

new Engines disposed of in the deals in which the Secondhand
Engines were taken. —The Secondhand Engines are in our way—we must
force them out by pricing them in such a manner that buyers can’t resist
the temptation.
It is very important that you remember that you only have to pay one=quarter
down the balance can be spread until February Ist, 1917. Bar the first the
Engine should earn its own payments before they fall due.
If you have any use for an Engine you can’t afford to miss this chance
it’s a really genuine opportunity to get an Engine at considerably less than
it’s honestly worth.

Douglas C.: Try a less religious paper.... Dr. 8.P.:
Your madness is varied enough, but it doesn’t
glitter... .Sidney L. E.: Your bright and cheerful
letter: “Dear Sir, —Enclosed you will find poem
entitled ‘A Bush Christening.’ If you like it send
the cash along to the above address.” But wouldn’t
it be a better joke if you were to submit it for sale
to “Banjo” Paterson? If you decide to do so, make
a new and correct copy. There are a few mistakes
in the present outrage, and it might annoy “Banjo”
to see that you had transcribed his verses carelessly
... .L.A.G.8.: No, mein Gott 1.... A.0.L.: Thanks, but
we can’t use Phyllis L.: Creditable verse; trouble
is we’ve already had miles just as g00d... .1.R.W.:
Don’t want the corpse in the river or the speechless
Paula.... Max P.: Be original and go to the war in
person. There are too many people singing war-
songs and writing notes on other people’s heroism.
....Mickey R.: You are no singer, Michael....
M. 5.8.: All below print....
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Syd N.: Picture is small potatoes and few in a
hill. Also, the centipede joke died long ago of
ancient weariness and prehistoric exhaustion....
Clara: Suggestions for pictures, if acceptable, are
paid f0r.... Eurella: Very elementary. You have
everything to learn... .A.G.A.S.: Thin, scratchy
humor... .H.W.C.: Both outed... .C.J.G.: Cannot
reply by letter. Work seems to have improved, but
you’ve got a long way to go yet... .K.U.F.: Too mild
a joke... .E.E.L.: None of them holds out a scrap of
promise.
Called on to render his final account,
Thomas Kennedy Macdonald, for 40 years
one of the foremost figures in Maoriland’s
municipal and political life. Wellington
Harbor Board, Municipal Council, House of
Reps, and the Legislative Council were all
invaded by the burly battler. He made lots
of money at various times and lost most of
it with great alacrity at various other times.
He lived every minute of his life until recently,
when, in the midst of a fiercely-contested
will case, in which his administration of an
estate was dissected by the Courts, paralysis
of the brain arrived and the old man finished
the race at =a. walk. Macdonald did some
large things. It was he who set the big
Gear Meat Co. on the rails, and with old
Donald Larnach he, years ago, formed a com-
mission of inquiry which rescued the Public
Trust Office from drowning. As a side line
he was a staunch and considerable ally of
“King Dick” Seddon.

IN BANANA LAND
The Liberal Association, “owing to the
continued apathy and lack of moral and
financial support from Liberals,” is to be
wound up: All it could do at the Federal
elections was to elect Groom and Stumm,
and its old hacks for the Senate never got
within cooee of the Labor six. An “asso-
ciation” with such a record needn’t trouble
to wind up a concern wh'.ch is dead of
inanition.
“McNorth”: “Wyangerie” alleges the
wholesale burning of valuable timber by the
cow-cockies of Atherton and thereabouts (B.
,10/9/’l4). The cow-worshipper of those
regions is of the same economical habits as
his fellow-disciples of the South, and to
destroy a valuable asset is not in his nature
The fact is many of the scrub timbers are
useless, and cedar, kauri and other woods of
commercial value exist only in patches. All
the saleable stuff within miles of a railway
is carefully cut and sent to the coast, and
great is the delight of a cocky who, when
clearing his land, drops across a good milling
tree. No fear of him burning it; the price
he’ll get for it will purchase another milker
or two! So far from the timber on the
Atherton tableland being wantonly
destroyed, the railway from there to Cairn's
is chiefly employed carrying logs. Inci-
dentally, it’s a grand country, with some of
the richest soil in the world, and, although
only a few hours by rail from Cairns, which
is a .stew-pot of a place, it has a cool, re-
freshing climate that produces the finest
girls and appetites in Bananaland.
From a friend of his: —
The late Henry Majoribanks Chester was by no
means “an adventurer” (B. 22/10/’l4). He, neither
“soldiered in India” nor was he in “the storekeep-
ing business,” nor did he ever “join the Queensland
police.” Tlis' career began as a lieutenant-in the
Indian Navy in 1849. He saw service in the Persian
Gulf, distinguishing himself at the capture of Mohum-
merah, for which he was mentioned in despatches and
received the Persian medal and clasp. During a
long furlough he travelled in Persia, Arabia and
Turkey-in-Asia, becoming acquainted with the lan-
guage, manners and customs of the people ; and that
led on to his appointment as British Political Agent
at the Court of the Imaum of Muscat. Coming to
Brisbane in the early ’6o’s, he was for some time
with the Union Bank, and left that to command the
N.Z. Insurance Co. in Queensland. After a couple of
years he joined the Government, first as surveyor in
the Warrego district—the towns of Charleville and
Cunnamulla were laid out by him. He was next
appointed Resident Magistrate at Somerset, Cape
York, and for nearly. 30 years was P.M. at Thursday
Island, Cairns, Cloncurry, Croydon, Cooktown, Cler-
mont and Gladstone, till he was retired under the
Septuagenarian Act, and went to Brisbane, where he
passed on at the age of 82 —another proof that the
white man can’t live long in the dreadful climate of
the North.
Some of Bananaland’s best-known horse-
bfeeders recently called on Minister for Agri-
culture White to persuade him to stop the
deterioration of the quadruped. It was
stated without qualification that in the last
20 years the Northern horse had been
steadily on the down grade, and the trouble
the Defence Department had in obtaining
suitable mounts was put in as evidence. The
police found themselves in the same bog,
and only got out of it by establishing a
station of their own. The first necessity is
to put badly bred and otherwise unfit stal-
lions out of action, and. this being admitted,
the Minister promised a Bill on that matter
shortly.
NO HOPE.
MRS. GETTHERE (enthusiastic worker for church fair): “Now, Mr. Rackelt , you really

RACKETT: “Very sorry, madam, but I don'l drive a motor.”
MRS. GETTHERE : “Oh, but you can learn, you know."
RACKETT: “Yes, but motoring does not agree with me. ]t makes me nervous.”
MRS. GETTHERE (with a bright idea): “Well, there isn’t the slightest probability of
your drawing it, you know."
Compensation claims arising out of the
Murphy’s Creek railway disaster have cost
Queensland £13,008. It is noted that rail-
way employees have been awarded about
three times as much as a workman could
obtain under the Employer’s Liability Act.
What is it —is the State thought to be just
a good mark, or are Courts beginning to
realise that the ordinary man who is battered
at his job is under-compensated?
That scornful remark by a German ambas-
sador that the treaty which professed to
secure the neutrality of Belgium was merely
“a scrap of paper” has called up recollec-
tions of two other “scraps.” One was the
repudiated pledge, according to which the
first Federal constitution was to be accepted
in N.S.W. provided it got a majority vote,
and the affirmative vote amounted to at least
50,000. The other was the solemn but unful-
filled covenant that, provided S.A. handed
over the Northern Territory, the Port
Augusta-Port Darwin railway would be con-
structed. Neither bit of paper had more luck
than Belgium’s bit, but the m(:n who tore
them up have so far had more luck than is
booked for Wilhelm.
The Queensland Railway Department has
definitely scrapped its McKeen rail-motors,
writing off £35,000 as a bad job. It lias
also sent the Renard road train over the tip
as a dead loss, and with the heartiest curse
oil record. Late Commissioner Thallon
bristled with good points, but lie should
have had a mechanical engineer at his elbow
when these calamitous contraptions were
sprung on him in his travels.
Just 50 years ago a persistent old crank
named Buhot was exhibiting a sample of
“good* dry, rich, yellow sugar, worth £4O a
ton,” made from cane grown at Maryborough.
All the machinery he had was a mangle for
crushing and a saucepan for boiling. Of
course the persistent old crank was told
that the thing was commercially impossible
and that Australia must leave that trade to
the West Indies and their cheap niggers.
To-day Australia not only grows all the
sugar it consumes, but actually pays about
£3 less, as a rule, for the white-labor pro-
duct than England pays for the black-labor
article from the Indies. Incidentally the
co. which does the refining and sells the
sugar at £3 less than the English market
price for “black” sugar makes a profit of
about £450,000, and pays a dividend of 20
per cent, or so on its actually-subscribed
capital.
Hearst, of the U.S. “Yellow” publications,
has been tracked by Collier’s (3/10/T4),
and awarded this wallop:—
One day last month the so-called American (New
York) had a cut with the line: “This is the type of
English soldier who is doing such tremendous work
on the battle-front in France.” On the same day
the German edition had the same cut, but gave it
this title: “British troops who are able to sprint so'
fast that the German soldiers cannot catch up with
them.” ' ■
Our American brother, who is now screech-
ing at the top of his voice for Australia’s
trade, is a mixed lot—particularly when
there are dollars at both ends. ’ -
A Song of Perfect Peace.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This is a song of perfect peace—an idle
moment rhyme
Made up by me, ’twixt yhWh and yawn, to
kill slow-footed Time.
It has no theme— it tells you naught; I only
Write it for
The one delight of telling you it’s not about
the tear!
1 ou’ll search it through hut never find a
curse of Kaiser Bill;
The hards have d—d him day and night in
verses fierce and shrill.
/ will ignore the wretched brute! No rage
will I exude—
And for that act of grace I claim the
reader’s gratitude.
I make no moan ; I chew no soap ; I do not
foam or kick,
For I have seen so many fits that fits now
make me sick;
My stock of patriotic rage ran out some
days ago;
I simply couldn’t shriek again about the
cursed foe!
There comes a time when curses, yells and
prophecies of death
About a beast who l-eads them not ffeem
waste of ink—or breath ;
That time at last has struck for me, atid so
I scream no more.
(P.S.—I couldn’t keep it out! This is
about the War! !)
QUEENSLAND.
USED UP.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, October. 31, 1914.
My Dear Thargomindah,—- „
This has been a week of weddings an of
the pomp and circumstance thereox. n
Wednesday P. W. Shannon, member ° the
Land Court, married the popular Cissie
Ileckelmann, at- the new church o >
Cecelia, Hamilton. Her two sisters weie
bridesmaids, and her little n\ e< l e ’ , 11 . < ‘ n , e
Cusack, was train-bearer or skirt-acimiiai.
The newly-marrieds left for Sydney, with
Hobart in anticipation.
Another wedding was that of 1 in Tabart
(whose mother was a Drury) to Alan mir-
gess, of Clutha station. The ceremony was
performed at Longreach. Afterwards Mr.
and Mrs. Burgess motored towards W inton
and their new home.
Yesterday afternoon A. T. Ellis, of the
Telegraph literary staff, agreed to cherish
and buy hats for Miss Annie Shepherd, an
extremely pretty little girl who is in her
second B.A. year a't the Queensland Uni.
In the morning George Woolnough, one or
the veterans of Australian journalism,
bestowed an armful of bric-a-brac on the-
youthful bridegroom, as an earnest ot the'
good wishes of his mates on the Telegraph..
A regimental wedding also happened this'
week. Sergeant William John Powell, of
E company, 15th battalion, 4tli brigade,.
A.1.F., was on Wednesday handed over to>
the domestic custody of Elsie Smith, I he-
sergeants made an archway of bayonets for-
the lady to parade her military prisoner-
under, while a royal salute or something like-
that was blown on the unmusical instrument
that looks like a brass candlestick.
The City Ladies’ Miniature Rifle Club is
now a force accomplished. The uniforms-,
are to be of khaki, with red facings, and the-
head confections are to match the spats..
The club has already had one shoot, and no >
marker was reported wounded or missing..
But, then, my dear, they had sworn not to 1
divulge the scores.
W. G. Lester, the veteran advance _ agent,
is seriously ill in the Mater Misericord ire ■
Hospital. He met with an accident at Rock-
hampton.
The Brisbane Women’s Club had a musical; 1 '
evening on Thursday night, when Mrs. Cliffe>>
Mackie led the farewell lament over- Miss
Ralston, who is going to do something for-
her country with the Australian Military
Hospital.
Wynn Williams, M.L.A. for Charters
Towers, gave Premier Denham warning on
Friday that he proposed to go further into
the matter of German Consul Hir-schfeld’s
membership of the Legislative Council: Did
the Premier know that the retention, of the
seat was causing “wide-spread-uneasiness and 1
dissatisfaction ?” In view of the fact that
Dr. Hirschfeld had not seen fit to resign
from the State’s Council. would) Denham
introduce or support a Bill to remove him?
Denham has a day or two to think iit over.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Australia is certainly helping the Empire
a lot. Bull has assisted' Belgium with
£10,000,000, and France fyas done the same.
Now it is obvious that somebody must help;
Servia, for that country has put practically
all its male population aged from 17 to 50
into the war, anfyit admits that it has spent
its last copper and eaten almost its last pig;.
At this crisis. arrangements are being madfe-
whereby poor Bull, with an invasion, of
Egypt on his hands, in addition to his.-other
troubles, is to guarantee a big loan for this
peaceful, untroubled, undamaged community.
Died in the service of the Queensland ’
Police, Thomas Leech, with official rank of
sergeant and natural rank of" genius. In
the police galley he was as much at ease as a
leviathan in a tub. Before coming to Aus-
tralia he published a vplume of poems in :
London- —“Life’s Pathway”—which received !
the approbation of the and 1
Austin Dobson. Whether the Athenaeum
and Dobson were too much for his muse, or
whether it just petered, out casually is not
known.
In the .Assembly the other night Bobbing-
ton, an unknown Liberal, made a noteworthy :
contribution to the financial debate: —
I-.look, on these loans ( £11,000,OOP) which fall
due in' July next as a very small affair. The more
we borrow, and the more we owe, the more able are
we to pay it back.
This is so obvious that one is surprised I
nobody has seen it before. For instance,
when you see a man going into a pawnshop
you don’t say “Poor devil —he’s hard up, I
suppose.” You remark, as a matter of
course, “Lucky devil! A dofcen more visits
there, and he’ll be a millionaire.” ’

‘EVEN HEAT”
No Spot too Hot
The Cost for an Average Family Ironing is only 3 pence
for electricity—when you use the G-E iron. Waste of heat is pre-
vented by air spaces which hold the heat down in the ironing surface
where you want a steady, uniform, even heat.
Be sure and get a “GENERAL ELECTRIC” iron with the big
G-E trademark on the guarantee tag.
with the G-E Electric Iron you get “ Even Heat.”
At the point, in the middle, around the edge, at the
heel—wherever the iron touches the goods —you get the
same even, uniform heat.
Don’t you see how this “Even Heat” makes better,
quicker ironing ? Don’t you see how, by saving time, “Even

ANAEMIA
and Weakness
j f
in Men, Women, and Children
Dr. ANDREW WILSON writes :
“It can be definitely stated
“that Iron ‘Jelloids’ constitute
“ the most effective and desirable
“treatment for Anaemia or Poor-
“ness of Blood. The sufferer is able
“to take Iron ‘Jelloids’ without danger,
“ even with pleasure, and with the sure
“knowledge that benefit will accrue.”
and re “ MEN AND TONICS.”
“There is a curious notion entertained by
“ the General Public that Iron Medicaments
“ are necessary for women only, and not for
“Men. This is an erroneous idea. Now I
“ have found the form of Iron ‘ Jelloids ’ put
“up with Quinine (called Iron ‘Jelloids’
“ No. 2a) to be an excellent tonic for men,
“and may be specially recommended.”
Breathing, hurried and gasping, on the slightest exertion, pale cheeks
lacking the ruddy glow of health, bloodless lips, a general feeling of weari-
ness—accompanied mavbe by pain after food, indigestion—constipation,
listlessness, inability of application to any pursuit or even train of thought
depression of spirits, and irritability of temper. Such symptoms indicate
Anaemia, and should, on no account, be neglected.
fd
*
will remove the causes and symptoms of Ansemia. Iron is
what your system requires. By taking it in the form of Iron
‘Jelloids’ the not uncommon disadvantages of other Iron
tonics are avoided. No ill-effects are set up. No constipation.
No “ rust ”in the stomach. No danger of non-absorption.
No fear of injury to the teeth. If you would have radiant
health, an elastic step and well-braced nerves, you must
have healthy blood. To improve and strengthen the blood
take Iron ‘Jelloids,’ commended by Medical Men, and
favourably reviewed by the Medical Press. As a general
tonic Iron ‘Jelloids ’ are excellent. They are pleasant and
easy to take.
A Reliable Tonic
Mrs C H Cator, 126, BarhvCorth Road, Rotherhithe, London, S.E.,
writes—" Having taken your ‘Jelloids’ for Anaemia, and found great
benefit from them, I shall endeavour to make known to all my friends the
great change that takes place so quickly. They are a blessing in disguise
to all women.”
A Fortnight’s Trial (price 1/6) will
convince you.

The Inky Way.
From Hugh McCrae: “Leaving Africa I
became interested in a German lunatic in
one of the hospital wards. He used to write
letters to God and the Kaiser and give them
to me to deliver. Later, arrived in London,
I met William Moore, Chomley (editor
British-Australasian), Col. lieay (Melb.
Herald), Miss Elms (once on the Argus),
Bill Dyson and Louise Mack. She looks
remarkably well and prosperous. On the
Lusitania I made so many friends that I
didn’t like leaving at New York. I met
J. S. Ryan outside the Times office. He
was staring up at the war bulletins and
looking like a millionaire ought to look but
doesn’t. We leapt at each other. He told me
he knew I was in New York. ‘Jimmy,’ a
fellow had said to him, ‘there’s a chap in
town now, I don’t know his name, but he’s
tali and is wearing a big sombrero. I’ve
often seen him on the North Shore ferry.’
•Hugh McCrae,’ said Ryan. ‘Lasso him and
bring him to me.’ But I found Ryan first.
Others I have run across here are Mario
Majeroni, Charlie Roife, I’at Sullivan, Bert
Levy, Harry Burne, Hilda Aiken. Sass
lives in some romantic suburb called Tomp-
kinsville. As for work, I can see a difficult
task in front of me ; for although there’s an
awful lot of tripe pushed through the New
York press (stuff that The Bulletin would
turn down at sight), it is pretty well imnos-
sible for a new man to assert himself —that
is, unless he is prepared to sit down and lay
siege to them for 12 months. There’s a ring
of men who supply everything in the way of
drawings, etc., that a newspaper needs, and
the puzzle is how to become one of -them.
Men don’t seem to start here at the bottom
of the ladder, but right away at the top. My
beginning, however, has been encouraging.
When I came here I went straight off to
Hy. Mayer, of Puck, with a batch of old
drawings. Mayer looked through them and
showed a certain interest. In fact he paid
them such close attention that he began to
doubt whether I had drawn them. At first
he asked me if they weren’t silver-prints,
and, then, because I had pasted out some of
the jokes, he made me assure him that they
had never been published. At last he said, I
admire your work for your versatility and
dexterity. But you must be more American.
Bring me something you’ve done in this
country.’ I went straight home, did two
drawings and took them to him. He a 9"
cepted both. Other chaps in New York
have been surprised at my —my good luck,
they call it. Of course, things are very bad
just now, chiefly on account of the war, and
artists are not only balked but are losing
billets.”

Ex-Australian “Smiler” Hales, who con-
tributed some fine purple patches to the
literature of the Boer war, is one of the
London Evening New*s reps, in France.
He probably hasn’t been to the actual
“front” ; but if personal courage can do the
trick he hasn’t been far away.

“Milo”: Arthur L. Brewer, who had the
extraordinary luck to get two short stories
in one Bulletin (22/10/T4), has been
caught with the desire to fight for the
Blood and the Language. Young Brewer
(he is only 22) started selling papers in
Sydney streets and did odd jobs in spare
time. Later, he attached his services to a
locomotive on the North Coast railway.
Then, allured by tales of the West, lie made
towards Charleville. Droving and all the
romance that is attached to it, or is sup-
posed to be attached to it, held him for a
time, after which he turned into Brisbane.
Deciding to try the Inky Way, he studied
Pitman, and obtained, in turn, berths on the
Standard and Daily News. When the
war fever caught him, his height just con-
formed to the tape requirements, but his
chest measurement was in arrears. The
proof-reader at the News undertook to
develop him. and in less than a fortnight
Brewer’s chest expansion left him about a
quarter of an inch more than the tape asked
for.
In the past 60 years the S. M. Herald
has had but four editors (not counting an
“acting” editor or two) —Rev. John West
(1855-’73), Dr. Garran (’73-’B5), Rev.
William Curnow (’B5 to 1903), Thomas
Heney (1903-T4). A son of John West died
in Sydney in mid-October. Like his father,
he was a Congregational parson.
DIGNITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The scene in the House oi Representatives was very
entertaining, but the laughter, cheering anil constant
tire of interruption robbed it of any dignity. Most
of the noise came from the Labor members. —Argus.
Y’ see me always ladylike. I make
Mistakes, of course-*— like tippin’ Cook to win.
I was agin conscription, which would take
An’ train our youth, an’ make the sea a lake
For an Horstralian fleet's manooverin’.
I ain’t a prophet—leastways, mightn't be ;
What keeps me unabashed is dignity.
When I falls in, I ses: “I told yer so.”
When falsified my prophecy, I blot
Out all its records; for yer know / know
’Ow short the memories of people grow—-
They soon forgit you talked ’em silly, rot.
But what I can't a-bear to ’ear or see
Is cheers, an’ smiles, an’ loss o’ dignity.
Y r et I can joke and deal in merriment;
Ithuriel with his spear can lightly strike —-
Light as a dray horse falling through a tent;
Gay as a usurer charging one per cent.
(Or any simile of gloom you like).
But how can any nation prosperous be
With ’lgh Protection and no dignity?
Me placket may be gaping; corset strings
May hang without ; me false ’air may come off ;
Me curls may shake when I speak low of kings ;
And I may foam at Commonwealths and things;
At Labor’s manners do me little scoff.
But I’m a lady, always proud an' free.
Even in gin I keep me dignity.
VICTORIA.

THE POPULAR “PLAIN HOME TALK.”
By Dr. E'. B. FOOTE.
Plates. 36 Chromos 400 Illustrations. 1248 Pages.
IT IS FREE FROM TECHNICAL TERMS, and shows up Human
Nature as it exists. Hereare answered, in plain language, a thou-
sand questions that occur to the minds of young and old, but about
which they feel a delicacy in consulting their physician. Chapters
are devoted to innumerable interesting subjects concerning mar-
riage, which makes it a superior guide to the action of men and
women both in and out of marriage. No man or woman w'no

Another Triumph for
LAXO-TONIC Pills
Mrs. M. ADAMS.
(From a Photo.)
"Allow me herewith to thank
you for the quick and per-
manent cure I have received
l»y lining your Laxo-Tonic
Fills for acute constipation
that had been giving me seri-
ous trouble for some time,”
writes Mrs. M. Adams, 00
Bowmont Street, South Inver-
cargill, N.Z. “I had used
numerous remedies before I
tried the above Pills, but they
were of absolutely no use
whatever in the way of giving
relief, much less effecting a
cure. Headaches and Bilious
attacks, vomiting after meals,
sleeplessness and great de-
pression of spirits were some
of the* numerous maladies I
suffered, but after using your
T.axo-Tonic Pills for a very
short time all those symp-
toms have entirely disap-
peared. I am altogether a
different person in feeling and
appearance, and I can now
enjoy a good meal of any
description without any fear
of the after agonies, and I
shall for ever feel grateful
and thankful for the great
relief and permanent cure I
have received by using your
L,axo-Tonic Pills.”
ALL LADIES NEED LAXO-TONIC PILLS.
Laxo-Tonic Pills can be taken at all times, and under all conditions, by both
young and old alike, without the least risk and without any danger of unpleasant
after effects. Laxo-Tonic Pills assist the process of nature, give relish to the
food, and prevent exhaustion, nausea, sick headaches, and other ailments to which
women are so accustomed. With the girl, the young woman, the mother, the
middle-aged woman, and the woman of advanced years, Laxo-Tonic Pills will prove
to be a most reliable friend.
Thousands of people take one every night at bedtime, to prevent dis-
orders of the Liver, Constipation, Bad Breath, Pimples and Headache.
Try them for a week—take one on retiring nightly. Small size, Is.; Large

The Same Old Way.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Love is the greatest thing in life, and yet it is
also the most monotonous thing in life. One love-
story is exactly like another love-story. Human
nature may invent new ways of moving over land
and sea and through the air, but it can never invent
a new way of making love. —James Douglas.
HERE’S many another way of doing
this,
There’s many another way of doing
that;
But in the matter of a courted miss
The same old squeeze there is, the same old
kiss
No matter whom you are, or where you’re
at.
There’s many another way across the land,
By train, or coach, or boot, or motor-car ;
But there is only one clasp of the hand —
The clasp that you, fond Sweetheart, under-
stand
When you gaze up at Love’s beholding
star.
There’s many a way of sailins- o’er the sea,
Third-class or second-, steerage or saloon —
Depends upon the fact of £ s. d.,
Our lack of it, or our prosperity ;
But there is only one dear lover’s moon.
There’s many another way of soaring high
Toward the zenith of the purple dome;
Bv monoplane or biplane we may fly—
A score of other methods we may try ;
But there is only one—the long—way
home.
There’s many a way of doing what we ought,
Of dodging, or of luring, Father Fate;
But there is only one mouth to be brought
To ours when hand in trembling hand is
caught
Within the shadows of the garden gate.
There’s many another way of doing that,
There’s many another way of doing this,
No matter whom you are, or where you’re
at;
But in the game of Love it’s tit-for-tat—
The same old glance, the same old squeeze
and kiss.

R. J. CASSIDY.
Marshall’s Choice.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Honorable Carrie Carruthers had
come to Mulwa Harbor hunting the
guide-book romance of “The
Islands.” It was a pity that he
brought his- sister Lisse with him, for
Marshall’s Dancing Girl was in har-
bor loading copra at the time, and Marshall
hadn’t kissed a white girl for a considerable
while. Old “Money” Carruthers had moulded
his pretty daughter on doormouse or tame-
kitten lines. Her brother, the Honorable
Carrie, so called because his Christian and
surnames were duplicates, was a wilful young
scamp with more cash than was good for him.
He woke things up considerably at Mulwa.
Amongst other freaks he took it into his head
to retrieve Marshall from the swine and
husks of a joyfully mis-spent holiday ashore,
and parade him for his sister’s edification.
She had heard from people in the hotel sev-
eral of the 900 stories of which Marshall was
the hero. They were all good people with
plenty of time to spare for other people’s busi-
ness, and they told the selected yarns beauti-
fully. The ones they couldn’t -possibly relate
they just hinted at, and told her regretfully
that they were shocked at her nice brother’s
association with such a dreadful man. Then,
having aroused her womanly interest, they
withdrew and left her to fall in love with
Marshall. That wouldn’t have mattered very
much if Marshall had not decided that he
wanted her very much ifideed. And when he
decided he wanted a thing he usually got it.
On the broad hotel verandah there were
blazing lights and the tinkling laughter of
women that is like ice against glass, and the
rustling of frocks, and the chatter of men and
women—the interminable chatter that is the
mark of civilisation. Marshall, with Lisse
Carruthers on his arm, strolled the length of
the place, and passed slowly across the stretch
of white sand to the pandanus belt that whis-
pered the secrets of the Pacific.
Being something of a savage, he started his
wooing bv kissing some of the civilisation out
of her. The night and the man fifed her blood
suddenly and woke her slumbering woman-
hood at once. In place of the conventional
girl he had kissed, a passionate woman clung
to him with an intensity that matched his
own. She had found her Romance, and,
woman-like, she wished to keep it for ever,
for she was too young to realise that Romance
only makes a beautiful memory when all is
said. So she begged Marshall to take her
away with him so that she might be happy
always, and presently her kisses had the salt
savor of tears. Tears and kisses together
madden a man. He saw half-amusedly that
she credited him with wonderful resources
both of brains and money. All of which
flattered him immensely. So he swore by the
God he had ceased to heed and by the few
things he still believed in—which, strangely
enough, included his own lost honor—that
Lisse should live with him the life she
desired.
Presently hot foot after them came the
Honorable Carrie; but in place of the milk-
and-water Miss he expected he found a defiant
young savage. He accompanied the pair back
to the hotel in angry silence, and noticed dis-
approvingly that Marshall touched his cap in
seaman’s fashion as his sister left them.
Vaguely he surmised that all sailors came
down the hawse-pipe; he did not know that
Marshall was a half-deck man and had held
his ticket these many years.
“I’d like to have a talk with yon,” he an-
nounced at last, with all the weight and pre-
cision of his twenty-three years, and Marshall
nodded with the carelessness that was his by
virtue of the thirty-seven that had greyed his
hair at the temples and drawn lines about his
mouth and neck and sharp-angled jaw. The
brother, in the first flush of his rage, could
hardly keep his hands off him ; but that phase
quickly passed. The situation could not be
cleared up by a vulgar brawl. Carruthers re-
joiced in the knowledge that a boat was due
to leave for Maoriland in a couple of days,
lie said so very pertinentlv with a vicious
look at his adversary. Marshall mentally
thanked the hot-headed boy for the warning,
and calculated that his plans would have to
include swiftness in their make-up.
“Of course, you understand that it is for
Lisse’s good I am taking her back to her
father at once.” me Honorable Carrie, doing
his best in the part of the heavy brother, was
hoping that Marshall would politely retire.
It was beastly annoying to leave like this in
the middle of a holiday. But Marshall showed
no signs of repentance. So the puzzled and
angry boy tried another tack. “You see how
impossible it would be?”
“Wliat would he impossible?”
The elder man was so infernally cool about
it that the Honorable Carrie lost his temper.
“A marriage between Lisse and you!” he
snapped. “You know very well that’s what
it would come to.”
“People would talk, certainly,” assented
Marshall, with a fine sarcasm.
“I shall forbid Lisse to see you,” said her
brother vindictively. “I’ll d —n it all, man,
haven’t you a spark of honor? Look at it!
She’s only a girl—not twenty yet!”
With a hot remembrance of her kisses and
tears, Marshall contradicted him flatly. “No,
you fool, she’s a woman, I tell you!”
“Well, more shame to you for taking her
girlhood from her! She’ll choose to think
she’s found a grand passion, and all the rest
of it, and there’ll be no end of trouble, and
the pater'll give me Hell,” said young Car-
ruthers in miserable prophecy.
“Yes, there’ll certainly be trouble one way
and another,” agreed Marshall wearily.
Then he faced the boy squarely. “She’s my
woman, lad,” lie said. “I don’t suppose
you’ll ever understand —-you don’t look like
the breed that does. You’ll marry someone
or other for position, or cash, or some other
d—d foolishness, and rear a family casually
enough. I’ve finished with casual love for
good and all. Better let me take your sister
fair and aboveboard and save a scandal.”
“My eye!” said young Carruthers, in a
sudden, humanising burst of vulgarity. “I’d
like to hear the pater about that! Lisse and
you! Oh, you’re mad —mad as a March
hare !”
Marshall looked him over. “Not mad
enough to throw away the last decent chance
of my life,” he said. Helplessly Carruthers
turned and left him. He tried to follow, but
the dazed lad shook him off. “Go to the
Devil!” he muttered.
Marshall went instead to liis nearest rela-
tive, who happened to be Rauke, the quarter-
blood. And he went to him because it was
only a very near and dear relation of the
Devil’s who could help him now. Since that
little affair -of the Senhor’s wife, Rauke, or
Tongue o’ the Islands, had been lying dis-
creetly low. In the circumstances, this was
not to be wondered at. Rauke loved white men
till they called him a black swine and told
him unpleasant truths. Lately he had been
consorting with the scum of the Islands, and
his fine, lithe physique was becoming obscured
in flesh. Only his periodical visits to the
tribe kept him in any way fit. His eyes
were red, and he was more than half-full of
squareface when Marshall dragged him out
of the evil-smelling deri "he had tramped half
the night to find. He marched his captive
out of earshot with a firm hand on the flac-
cid-muscled shoulders; and presently the
cool night air partly sobered the quarter-
blood, and he was able to understand what
the white man was saying.. ..
“But supposing you borrow a boat, they
will still watch the sea, even if you leave the
Dancing Girl in harbor.”
“It isn’t that,” said Marshall. “There
probably won’t be a missionary within coo-ee
to marry us, and you know the way news
flies amongst your—er —the niggers. There’ll
be a hue and cry in less than five hours, and
then all the missionaries will be warned
against marrying us. See?”
Rauke inquired what the missionaries had
to do with marriage, anyhow. His ideas on
the subject were primitive. Marshall’s were
also primitive, but he was thinking now of
Lisse. lie had called her his last decent
chance in life, and, by reason of that, he
would not be more of a blackguard than he
could help.
“Take her up country,” said Rauke sud-
denly. “We can go round the coast in a
native boat and then strike inland. We
leave some of my men behind to talk, eh?
Then the clever people hunt the seas and
every other island while we go inland to my
mother’s people.”
“No, thanks!” Marshall’s refusal was so
prompt that Rauke concluded the girl must
be very pretty indeed. “We’ll lie low for a
few days,” continued Lisse’s lover. “Perhaps
they’ll be glad enough then to let me marry
her.”
“No need for marrying then,” Rauke
pointed out. Like most men of mixed blood,
he was evil of thought apd intent. Marshall
did not discuss the matter further, but pro-
mised him a small partnership in a trading
venture as recompense for his trouble. His
undying white man’s friendship was thrown
in as a sort of bonus.
Before daybreak, Rauke, who was not
called Tongue o’ the Islands in jest, had per-
suaded a score of “boys” into a venture
whereof they knew next to nothing. By
noon they swaggered exceedingly, and inti-
mated that all other men were cowards. In-
cidentally they tried to convey the impres-
sion that they were heroes.
Meanwhile the Honorable .Carrie was also
well occupied. He could not very well chain
his sister up in the hotel, or lock her door,
and she refused to oblige him by retiring
with a violent headache. They breakfasted
together in grim silence. The boy was angry
and uncomfortably red. Lisse" was start-
lingly white, and her'eyes shone feverishly.
Her brother, who had sulkily prepared him-
self to play tin- part of barnacle for some 36
hours, attributed this to temper. But it was

EVERY mother and housewife
whose life is made miserable
by the distressing pain and incon-
venience of bad legs or swollen
and discharging ankles should
follow the example of Mrs. A. James,
of U Gowrie Street, Newtown, Sydney,
and apply Zam-Buk, the great antiseptic
and germicidal healer, which is a proved
remedy for these complaints.
Immediately Zam-Buk is applied to a
poisoned or suppurating surface, it sets to
work to cleanse the tissues, kill the poison
germs, make the wound clean and healthy, and
finally promote the growth of new, healthy skin.
“ I sustained a scratch on my left ankle,!.' gays Mrs.
James,“ and the dye getting into the wound from
the stocking caused blood-poison to set in, my leg all
breaking out into ulcers. Inflammation spread up my
leg, and the swelling was very great, more so as I tried
to get about on it when I should have been resting. The
limb continued bad for three months, during which time I
tried several ointments, etc., but the other treatments
brought me not the slightest relief. I was, luckily,
recommended to use Zam-Buk.
THE BALM BROUGHT ME RELIEF AT THE VERY
FIRST APPLICATION—
it reduced the inflammation and swelling, cleansed the wound, and
made it look much healthier. The wound now healed rapidly,
and I have had no ill-effects from the injury since.
“ Zam-Buk was also most healing in a case where the heat of the
blood brought out a skin eruption, which was most irritating, being
one of the severest forms of eczema. I used different remedies,
but Zam-Buk was then applied, and its soothing and cooling effect
was at once noticed. It finally cured the outbreak. Since then
we have used Zam-Buk for all injuries and bruises and anything
of a like nature, with always excellent results/'

SOME HOME RECIPES.
By RITA MOVA.
A eomnlexion that appears clear, fresh and natural is as necessary to the smart woman
as a modish gown. More attention should be given to keeping the skm nt *
details of dress. The face, constantly exposed to wind, dust, fatigue and strain, •
regular and watchful care. One great cause of complexion troubles is the req. ‘
greasy, inactive preparations which clog the pores and prevent the natural
of waste matter. My repeated advice is to avoid made-up cosmetics, and to use . '
ingredients. The various aids to beauty which I recommend are-simple, and 1 . ,‘ p
at hand, can be procured from any reliable chemist. If lie has not. what yo Q •
can easily obtain it for you from his wholesaler. Only let me advise you to 1 • ■
ing the original ingredients, and not to accept some made-up preparation in
About Shampoos. —To quote an eminent
London beauty specialist: “The slimy egg
cannot dissolve the scalp impurities, but only
adds to the trouble by completely choking the
pores with animal matter.” The substance
sticks and decomposes, thereby causing the
liair to assume a dead, “dull color.” I heart-
ily endorse every word. Avoid eggs (and
soap, too) on your hair. Try the delightful pre-
paration made by stirring a teaspoonful of
stallax in a cup of hot water. It will bring
out new beauty possibilities in your hair, will
clear and prevent dandruff, and leave that
fine, fluffy effect so much sought after. It
also removes excess oil or greasiness.
Complexion Secrets of an Actress. —In a re-
cently issued volume bearing the above title
the author says: “Continual use of grease
paints, rouge and the like, has ruined my
complexion. My skin was colorless, wrinkled,
coarse and punctured with large pores. In
America I heard of the virtues of mercolised
wax; my first experience with this marvellous
substance convinced me it was more valuable
than all the cosmetics combined. Now, when-
ever my complexion begins to go wrong, I get
a small quantity of mercolised wax at the
chemist’s, spread on a thin layer of it before
retiring, washing it off in the morning. The
wax, after a few such applications, seems
literally to absorb the worn-out cuticle, when
a brighter, healthier, younger looking skin
appears.
Face Fuzz. —Many women know how to re-
move superfluous hair temporarily, but to
banish it for ever is quite another matter. As
regards depilatories, I must say that there are
very few good ones. They nearly all irritate
the skin, and even then only give temporary
relief. Powdered plieminol acts in a wonder-
ful manner, and the recommended treatment
is designed not only to immediately remove
the ugly hairs, but to also permanently des-
troy the roots.
Scanty Eyebrows and Lashes. —What a
wealth of expression call be given to an other-
wise plain face by fine arching eyebrows and
long curling lashes! Much care should be
exercised, however, in choosing a pomade for
promoting the growth of eithei, as. i *
tically impossible to keep the lids tightly ■
when treating the lashes. Mennaline *>as tne
advantage of being perfectly harmiess, an 1 t
the same time a healthy stimulant to the a
follicles. Its use tends# to darken the ne
growth, which presumably is what mo
women desire.
Is Powder Necessary? —l say emphatically
No! There is a simple lotion which can he
easily and cheaply made at home, ana _ ■
at the same time both effective and benefi
to the complexion. Cleminite is a splen
substitute for face powder, which is at tne
bottom of many complexion troubles. m
about an ounce from the chemist s and o .
solve in four tablespoonsful of .water, tne
result is a fine clear liquid, wlnch instan
gives the face, neck or arms that Peach- ime
bloom of perfect health. There is nothing
equal it for greasy skins, and the result a® l
all day long under the most trying conditions.
Try it for the next dance.
Falling Hair.— How often one hears the
lament: “I have tried everything on tne
market, and my hair comes out in banaium.
Not so surprising either ylien you, . c ® m l l l , Si i-
think it over. Hair tonics to he effective mm a
be fresh, and there is no earthly reason way
every woman should not make her own lotto
at home. The finest vegetable tonic I know
of is made by mixing a packet of boran i
with i-pint of bay runi and adding
water to fill a half-pint bottle. This 1°
rubbed briskly into the scalp sets the i a
roots tingling with new life, and will, i P
severed with, give you back your crowni g
glory.”
For Pale Faces.— Some folks are naturally
pale, and I see no harm whatever m adding
little color to the cheeks if so desired, koug ■
however, is always obvious, and to people
refinement somewhat vulgar. There IS , a
stance, however, known as powdered co
andum, which gives a perfectly natural c •
and at the same time defies detection. APP .

2] Wickham Street. Valley, Brisbane,
only excitement, for she had received word
from Marshall and knew what she had to do.
Having ceased to be an automaton, she was
determined to do it.
Marshall sauntered in late to breakrast.
Her brother shifted uneasily as he took his
usual seat opposite with polite, formality.
Presently he proposed an excursion for tlie
day. “Anywhere you like,” he added obli-
gingly.
The Honorable Carrie hurriedly announced
that he and his sister would be occupied all
day with their packing. Marshall mur-
mured sympathetically and deplored the
possession of so much luggage. “It is a
bother all the time and keeps you from see-
ing things,” he added. The subject of the
excursion was not renewed, and he told
them, before excusing himself, that he had
to see to the loading of his boat preparatory
to sailing in three days’ time. Then he
gracefullv departed, and Miss Carruthers
and her brother fell to making disparaging
remarks to each other. Most of the Honor-
able Carrie’s remarks ended with a solemn
reference to “the pater.” The burden of his
■sister’s tale was that she didn’t care.
The boy lit a cigarette after breakfast
and unobtrusively followed Lisse to her
room. He lit and smoked a great many
more cigarettes during the morning as he
stared out the window at nothing in particu-
lar. Once he knocked at her door, which
she had slammed in his' face, .and in-
quired if she were packing. She said “Yes, ’
and he thought he heard her crying. He
called her “a good little thing.” and retired
once more, to smoke and watch who came
in or went out of the hotel.
Marshall had not returned by lunch, a
meal at which Miss Carruthers put in an
unexpected appearance, much to her
brother’s relief. She ate wen and uranK a
glass or two of ridiculously sweet cham-
pagne. All the afternoon she chatted and
laughed with some of the other guests,
always conscious that her brother was
watching her.
Marshall did not turn up for dinner, lhe
boy thought it was rather decent of him.
But he was taking no chances, and kept close
to his sister all the evening.
By a quarter to 10 her patience was
strained to breaking point, for at 10 o’clock
she had to meet Marshall. Her brother
noticed something was amiss and sug-
gested that she should go to bed. She
muttered something about fresh air doing her
good, and, rising, went outside. He followed
resignedly. She walked quickly and spoke
little. He recollected several platitudes
about moonlight and inflicted them on her.
At last they reached the pandanus belt.
“It’s rotten dark in here, Sis,” he pro-
tested weakly. Then be heard her stifled
scream. A muffled voice said, “Sorry, old
chap!” and a hard fist caught him on me
point of the jaw, and jarred the senses out
of him. He was conscious of falling heavily
on sand. Then he was aware that someone
was feeling him over anxiously. Evidently
the examination was reassuring, for firm
hands seized him and gagged and bound him
very securely. A couple of Eauke’s men
took him at shoulders and feet and carried
him some distance into the belt, while Mar-
shall assured Lisse that her brother was not
hurt in the least and would be released next
morning.
“The boat goes out to-morrow; this is
your only chance.” So her lover told her,
while she glanced distrustfully at _ the
stealthy natives. But the excitement of it all
gave her courage. She walked back to the
hotel with Marshall, and. at his bidding,
put on a wrap. Under this she carried a
few necessary articles. They walked boldly
out again under the eyes of the watchful
gossips.
When they got back, Eauke was busy
with a palm branch obliterating traces as
well as might be. She giggled excitedly as
they got into the boat. Eauke stayed to the
last, giving orders in the vernacular to the
native who was to discover the Honorable
Carrie in the morning. Then he too got
in, and the men bent to their paddles lustily.
Lisse dried her eyes furtively as the water
widened between them and the land. Then
quite suddenly she nestled contentedly to
Marshall.
In the distance the Dancing Girl stood out
to sea in charge of a surprised mate. “They'll
chase her,” said Eauke, “and scour every
island and atoll but this.” He had played
the like of this trick before.
The chill midnight air blew sharply
through the girl’s inadequate clothing.
Marshall wrapped an extra coat about her,
and she slept at last, cramped up against
his knees and with his arm for support.
He realised that she was very young and
weak. He may also have comprehended
what a blackguard he was.
The men pulled steadily with a strong
rhythmic swing, and Eauke softly chanted
an Island song for their timing. They hugged
the shore and darkness as much as possible,
till the dawn came up out of the sea, fresh
and smiling. When it grew to broad daylight
Lisse stirred and awoke in Marshall’s numb
and stiffened arms. She cried out at the un-
familiar coastline and the great, unbroken
stretch of sea. As she rubbed the sleep from
her eyes, Eauke noticed how pretty and
pathetically child-like she appeared. Her
soft, dark hair curled about her small, ivory-
skinned face, and her eyes were bright with
excitement. He stood up in the boat and
chanted sonorously so that the tired men
bent again to their work with a will. His
naked toes curled about the thwarts, and
he swayed not at all as the boat climbed
over the seas. He looked a very fine figure,
and was well aware of the fact.
Presently the toiling men joined in the
chant, sending the long, nasal notes at the
ends of the lines far on the still air. Their
muscles rolled freely under their gleaming,
oiled skins. Their lava-lavas were bright
and new. Here and there a great white bone
nose-ring gleamed, and their shell earrings
brushed their bronze neck-columns. The
rising and falling paddles flashed a million
jewels defiantly in the face of the risen sun.
The vivid color and movement of it all
blent in a picture of savage beauty whereof
Eatike was the central figure. Very soon
the quarter-blood found the inlet he sought,
and he swung the boat in and beached her.
The wearied rowers ate and slept awhile,
full-stomaclied —they had only been chewing
betel all night—while Marshall and Rauke
shaped their plans. There would be a long
march inland, they told Lisse. bhe was
quite willing to face it; but Eauke pomtec
contemptuously to her thin-soled shoes. >- -
had only provided for flight in pn e ot tl L
schooners. They got over the difficulty bj
rigging up a litter. She found this mode ot
travelling delightfully strange and romantic,
of course. ,
That night the men made her a rougn
shelter, and she went to rest trusttuliy
enough, for Marshall slept across the open-
ing with a loaded revolver held in an affec-
tionate grip. He was a very light sleepei,
as Eauke well knew, and an excellent shot
to boot.
In the morning they decided to camp
where they were for a day or so while a
man went back to reconnoitre. The inci-
dental hunting and fishing delighted lusse;
and all the time Marshall made love to her
in a grim, restrained fashion, while Eauke
looked on and called him a fool 20 times a
day. The quarter-blood himself looked at
her with bold eyes of admiration, as the
open-air life brought color to her cheeks.
The keen-eyed Marshall noticed this, and the
girl herself spoke timidly of it to him.
Thereafter liis manner towards Eauke, for
all his debt of gratitude to him, was no
longer that of equality. Eauke resented it,
and there was trouble between them. Once
they broke into open and violent quarrelling.
Marshall patched the matter up for Lisse's
sake; but that night he did not sleep at
all. lie mentioned going back to the coast
and getting across to the next island, where
there was a Presbyterian missionary. It was
likely now, so he pointed out, that the mis-
sionary would, at this late date, mercifully
disregard any warnings he might have re-
ceived and marry them. Eauke objected to
this move on the ground that he must wait
for his men. Two days later they returned
with the report that the Honorable Carrie
was searching feverishly in all the wrong
places. And he had the devoted but unin-
telligent assistance of all hands.
Marshall begged the quarter-blood to start
the return journey at once. He did not
know the country or he would have risked
himself with Lisse. That night Eauke spoke
of extra reward, and the harassed white
man promised him anything. He scarcely
closed his eyes, and his offer to Lisse of a
revolver “for defence” only met with blank
wonder. By the third night he was tired
out, and the quarter-blood seemed bent on a
quarrel. At last he named the shameful
price that sent the white man’s hand to his
revolver hilt.
“Don’t be a fool!” said Eauke sharply.
“Who d’ye think keeps these fellows under V
They’re armed with machetes, too —and, well
they’re only men, after all. If you kill me”
—the other had already realised the futility
of it—“you can’t expect to keep awake for
ever, you know.”
In order that the girl might not under-
stand, Marshall dropped into the vernacu-
lar. Lisse, in her rough shelter, listened
uncomprehendingly. But quite suddenly
she was aware of the close shine of eyes.
She screamed, and Marshall and Eauke
together searched for the cause of the
alarm. They dragged a man out of the
shadows, and it was Eauke’s revolver that
spat death in his face.
Lisse shrieked and shrieked unendingly—
or so it seemed to the two defenders. She
had never seen death before, and the sav-
agery of life had been shown to her in a
flash by the rapid tragedy. The other
natives spoke together angrily, and their
two white leaders drove them back with
brandished revolvers and extravagant threats.
They seemed to take no notice of the girl.
She was bitterly afraid.
Eauke spoke straightly when the trouble
was over and Lisse’s outcry had subsided
into a comfortable and puppy-like sniffing.
“If one of us shoots the other, who’s going
to hold these devils back single-handed '!
Now, between us”
“Yes, between us”—-Marshall broke in,
and held out his hand in token of amity. But
the other finished his sentence. His face
was evil in its triumph as he made his
villainous proposal.
“You black swine!” hissed Marshall.
“Oh, you black-hearted dog!” Then he
fairly raved at him.
Eauke’s eyes blazed as he listened. He
was inordinately proud of his white blood.
One woman more or less was nothing to him,
but his racial vanity was everything. He
would take full toll of Marshall for the
deadly insults he had heaped upon him. His
cunning brain worked quickly. He would
drive the other into a corner. “If you try
to keep her for yourself,” he said slowly,
“well and good. I’ll go away. But I leave
the others behind me! See! I only hope
you’ll be able to keep awake and manage
them. I wouldn’t like them to hurt the
little Sunday-school miss.” His soft Island
accent made his remarks sound quite plea-
sant. But Marshall well knew that there
was no mercy in Tongue o’ the Islands when
he spoke so. Yet he begged piteously for
the girl. Eauke laughed and reminded him
that he was only a black swine. He was
not at all afraid, for he knew that his death
would not help the white man at all. So
he repeated his terms quietly while he killed
a couple of mosquitoes.
The girl, whom Marshall loved above his
own desire, noticed the lull and turned
trustfully to her lover. In the semi-dark-
ness her torn and stained frock clung about
her lithe young body fresh and white as a
bridal gown. Marshall drew his breath
sharply. He recalled his own life with
shame, but he sickened when he thought of
Eauke’s. He knew there could only be one
ending to it all; but he fought the knowledge
desperately. Once he thought to kill him-
self with the one shot left in the revolver.
But that was the easy, coward’s way that
he might not take.
He saw the dead man lying outstretched.
He saw Eauke standing, careless enough to
all seeming, but with a smouldering fire in
his great eyes and a certain tenseness in his
muscles that indicated the strain he was
under. And, far back in the shadows, he
saw the others waiting.
The wind lifted a scud of cloud from the
moon, just as Lisse ran stumbling to him
with a queer, choked little cry. It dropped
to a moan half-way, and Marshall flung away
his empty revolver and sprang to catch her
body as it fell-,- - V

“I like jßemi/lgtori.-UMC arms and am-

I made my reputation and have won

I have never found any reason for
