Creative Rhythm
It was characteristic of those restless
Greeks that they fouud it necessary to fashion
a word which should express the idea “to
flow.” And it was equally characteristic of
their discriminating heirs, the Romans, that
they seized upon this rhuthnios and pressed
it into their service and currency. So that
we, in turn, the heirs of these conquering
plagiarists, have at command our glib
“rhythm” that has been so much overworked
of recent years.
For there is nowadays among enlightened
critics a growing disposition to value all
aesthetic experience in terms of rhythm. It
is, for instance, a familiar paradox of the
newest criticism that it will tolerate stress-
inversions, additional syllables and other im-
pediments in the metre of a poem, upon the
proviso that its rhythmic continuity is not
too awkwardly crossed; and eveu a touch
of cross-rhythm, if it be cunningly intro-
duced and subservient to the design, will
pass honorably enough and be known among
the subtler sort of pundits as a “resol u-
tion”-—-yet another term from the vocabu-
lary of the musician.
Long before I had heard any music worth
mentioning I was certainly the slave of
rhythm, and as a child would drum my
fingers upon a tin, hour by reckless hour,
exulting in the assurance that the day was
not far distant wdien I should beat a real
drum thus fervently to the fifes and brass
of the King’s army. Physically I had had
my beginning, I suppose, about, eight years
before; but this clamorous drumming was
the. occasion, I felt, of something even more
decisive: the birth of ipy sesthetic Ego, to
whose judgment all the shows and values of
life were henceforth to be committed. Later,
when I discovered my mother’s piano, and
tasted the completer joy of pounding out
reverberating passages of nonsense, I was
already confirmed in the disposition to test
all emotional experience in terms of rhythm.
And even when I came to learn to play the
violin my earlier allegiance was stili un-
shaken ; for, as “rhythm” is, in our usage,
perhaps more often identified with “pulsing”
than with “flowing,” it was the piano that
best expressed, and still expresses, for me
“the glory of motion” in music.
“The glory of motion”—De Quincey’s
phrase—-finds a notable exponent in Emile
Jaques Dalcroze, who demonstrates, in his
suggestive book, “Le Rhythme, la Musique
et l’Education,” that rhythm is the aspect
of music which first appeals to children. It
is certainly easier to agree with this dictum
than with that in which he declares that
“movement is the basis of all the arts.”
When critics speak of a representation in
stone or paint as having “movement,” they
really mean rhythm. • Rhythm, however you
define, it, is as distinct from movement as
color is from light, or form from content. It
is, for various psychological reasons, in music
that the secrets of all the arts are sub-
merged, as Pater’s familiar aphorism con-
stantly reminds us; and all absolute music,
from fantasy to fugue, is pure rhythm. Whole
passages depend for elucidation, in fact, upon
an intelligent following of their rhythmical
raisonnement , as anyone will agree who hap-
pens to hear an amateur “trying over” for
the first time one of Brahms’s Walzen, those
miniature marvels of form. Let us suppose
that this . performer, having murdered his
Brahms, is now requested to read aloud
“The Lake Isle of Innisfree.” This is,
admittedly, one of the loveliest things of our
day; it is also as disconcerting to read aloud
at first sight as the waltzes are to play. That
he will muddle its elusive rhythms is, there-
fore, almost certain; but to how many ears
will the second experience be as positively
disagreeable as the first. Suppose, again, the
same obliging amateur, being handed a pencil,
is asked to copy at one stroke some simple
rhythm of curves, such as Hogarth’s Line
of Beauty or the shape of my violin. How-
ever primitive the result, however ludi-
crously wide of the mark, it is certain that
aesthetic propriety will be still less shocked
by it than by the mangling of Yeats’s poem.
And this is because duration and move-
ment, those essential components of abso-
lute rhythm, are factors which do not con-
tribute to sesthetic results in painting. Those
Futurist attempts to render the dynamic sen-
sation, rhythm and movement (i.e., mobility)
of an endlessly multiplied object—“a run-
ning horse having not four legs, but twenty,”
as they said —these were merely abortive,
after all. For camera and kinema have re-
lieved the sincere painter of so much hamper-
ing impedimenta that henceforth ho will
probably leave it to pot-boiling talents to
fake an illusion of motion in paint.
In the hands of the poet, though, time and
movement are scarcely less plastic than in
the cadences of pure music; only we are
less conscious of their fluent subtleties be-
neath the cloaking “sense” of the words and
their associations. Stripped of these (as
when reduced by the scanning schoolboy to a
string of strictly accountable time-units),
the metre stands out plain as posts in a
wire fence. Against this metrical—or aritb-
metrical—strictness there is widespread re-
bellion among contemporary poets; in whose
technical calculations metre is being dis-
placed by rhythm, as a gauge of the tem-
poral content of verse forms. This neces-
sarily calls for an exquisite sensibility in
the mind of the poet to the subtlest effects
of rhythm; and, indeed, some of our vers-
libristes, to whom fixed form is a sort of
intractable Ulysses-how, are neither hushed
nor diffident in their claims to this sensi-
bility.
. It was, therefore, interesting to note that,
in lus recent searching, but not unsympa-
thetic, discourse on free verse Robert
Bridges, master of classical verse, conceded
that between the markedly different rhyth-
mical effects of prose and metrical verse
there lies an unclaimed field in which it
might be possible “to construct something
that shall be neither the one nor the other ”
In other words, it is conceivable that tlie
whole art of versification might be based
on speech-rhythm. But this (cndenced prose
or free verse) “is good and theoretically de-
fensible only in so far as it can create the
old expectancy (of rhythm] without the nVl
metrical devices.” Failing this, it is but
“a broken, jerky sort of tyid prose; and the
old, fluent prose needs not me nor anyone
else to defend it from those who would cut
it to pieces and call its fragments verse.”
Thus, a free-verse poem—the spontaneous re-
solution of a purely individual emotion into
unique, continuous rhythms of speech—is
necessarily a law unto itself. And that,
briefly, is why the academic critic, vainly
guessing at the emotional genesis of the lyric
and deprived of his familiar prosodic tests,
tubes, scales, measuring-rod and what not,
chucks the effusion into his wastepaper-
basket and turns again with unctuous relish
to his Milton and dear, crepuscular Tenny-
son. It is not for me to judge him : Time
will do that.
But occasionally I —yes, even I—have
found myself carving little slabs of free verse
while night turned to dawn. And if I am not
so naive as to entertain the delusion that
our newest voices are necessarily the sweet-
est and best, neither am I, on the other-
hand, so settled and sagging as to insist that
they are always blatant and tuneless. I am,
therefore, in a position to recommend the
following austere saying of Coventry Pat-
more’s to the consideration of both revolu-
tionary and reactionary poets: “The glory
of art is in showing life as rejoicing in and
completed by law; and the prayer of the
great poet is that of the great, prophet—
‘Order all things in me strongly and sweetly
from end to end.’ ”

Katherine Mansfield
It is curious that not one of the mai
appreciations of Katherine Mansfield as
•short-story writer has noted that several
her best studies —stories that have made h
famous not only in England but also on t
Continent and in America —have their se
ting in Maoriland, and carefully depi
scenes and people in Wellington and plac
adjacent. “Prelude,” the first tale in “Bliss
for instance, is an exact description of
family move, say, from Wellington to Ilav
lock. “The Voyage” in “The Garden Party
—a collection of her more mature work—
a humorously faithful description of a litt
girl’s crossing of Cook’s Straits in circum
stances that she was too young to compr
fiend. “At the Bay,” in the latter volume,
rightly placed first, for it makes the trifle
of life in Maoriland swim to vision, wil
its brilliant succession of pictures that and
not stroll, but rather flash, in the way o
the movies. Each person or character play
a part for a moment; or two, small ye
vivid, and each gives cumulative force' t
a neat if whimsically harmonious whole
Seldom in a short 60 pages have so man
typically local yet eternally fresh scene
and characters been more clearly visualiset
Crescent Bay itself; the dog with the drov
of sheep; the coach that crawled to town
the wash-house and its appurtenances on £
sultry summer’s day; self-centred Stanle
Burnell, the athletic father of three littl
girls and a son, all unwanted of Linda, hi
wife; Jonathan Trout, idealist and Govern
ment clerk, with his manly little chaps. Pit
and Rags; Alice, the servant girl, and he
visit to Mrs. Stubbs, the storekeeper anc
postmistress; kind Mrs. Samuel Josephs
naughty and nasty Mrs. Paul Ivember, bath

baby son; gregariously amorous Mr. Pau
Kember—these and many others flit acros.
her pages as sharply focussed photographs
and well-colored photographs, too.
“The Garden Party” shows Katherine
Mansfield at her best, for it is almost the
only one of the more important that allows
heart to triumph over head. The dis : llusion
of the enthusiastic schoolgirl, whose life was
bounded by Hobson-street and Muritai, is
humanised by the sure touch with which the
relation of brother and sister is drawn. Laura
had rushed over in all her garden-party finery
to inquire about Mrs. Scott, whose husbanc
had been killed that morning,
....He was given up to his dream. What die
garden-parties and baskets and lace frocks mattei
to him? He was far from all those things. He was
wonderful, beautiful. While they were laughing anc
the band was playing, this marvel had come to the
lane. “Hanny—happy—all is well.” said'that sleeo-
ing face. “This is just as it should be. I am con-
tent.” But, all the-same, you had to cry.
At the corner of the lane she met Laurie. He
stepped out of the shadow. “Is that you, Laura ?”
“Yes.’’ “Mother was getting anxious. Was it ail
right?” “Yes, quite. Oh, Laurie!” She took his
arm ; she pressed up against him.
“I say, you’re not crying, are you?” asked her
brother.
Laura shook her head. She was.
Laurie put his arm round her shoulder. “Don’t
cry,” he said in his warm, loving voice. “Was it
awful ?”
“No,” sobbed Laura. “It was simply marvellous.
But, Laurie”
She stopped, she looked at her brother. “Isn’t
life,” she stammered—“isn’t life”— But what life
was she could not explain. No matter. He quite
understood.
“Irn’t it, darling?” said Laurie.
“The First Ball,” “The Stranger,” “An
Ideal Family” and others could be cited to
show that most of her best work is indige-
nous to Maoriland. An acute and rather
acidulated story, “The Daughters of the Late
Colonel,” is probably a reminiscence of a
type frequently found in M.L.—and else-
where.
Her earliest collection of stories, “Life
in a German Pension,” is interesting and
amusing enough : there are glimpses, but not
more, of the critical and always humorous
Katherine Mansfield of “Bliss” and “The
Garden Party.” Except for the first fun
about the German ways of eating, there
seems to be merely an obsession —and boring
at that —on the subject of the production of
children. The only real story is that of
“The Little Girl Who Was Tired.”
To compare her work, always sketchy, with
the elaborate, leisured novels of Jane Austen
would be ridiculous. Jane Austen lived
observantly in a tiny, sheltered circle, and
shows no signs of having heard of the stir-
ring events of Napoleonic tunes, except soci-
ally and parochially: Katherine Mansfield
lived in a newer and wider world, and is only
akin in that she gives a photographic picture

of what comes to her eyes. Again, to com-
pare her. as some have done, with writers of
width, like Tchekhof; of imagination, like
Kdgar Allen P'oe: of surprise, like O. Henry,
is to do a vain and unnecessary thing. Kath-
erine Mansfield had a facility or knack of
painting neatly and inimitably in words the
people that crossed her path. Her manner
was ironic, and. as is the way of all true
humorists, sympathetic. As a literary and
yet accurate picture of the social life of
Maoriland in the early days of the present
century, her sketches deserve the same sort
of appreciation as those of the authoress of
"The Caravaners” and similar works.
The surprise is that one who has been
acclaimed the '‘best story-teller in the world”
should be so little known in the country of
her birth. Once more one is tempted to
allude to the “prophet without honor” ; but
rather than that we may suggest to any
M.L. reader, not entirely given over to the
study of crude American types, cheap and
obvious, that there is still room for a M.L.
novelist. Until such a person appears on
the scene we shall think of Katherine Mans-
field as one who might have attained to that
height.
H. B. WATSON.
Sex and Language
Much as we may admire the pleasing com-
plexion, well-turned ankles and free dress
of the modern flapper, we must hate her
for the harm she is doing the English lan-
guage. Under her influence it is becoming
a series of ugly exclamations.
Otto Jespersen, in his “Language: Its
Nature, Development and Origin,” advances
new theories on the language of women.
Their jerky speech is the outward expres-
sion of a trivial, sensation-seeking mind.
Their quick minds dart from thought to
thought, disconnectedly and unsystematically.
They talk to think. Dresses, picture shows,
divorces, races are poured out in one breath.
Says Rosalind in “As You Like It” : “Do
you not know I am a woman? When I
think I must speak.” So women’s speech
becomes a shambling mass of adjectives and
adverbs and unfinished sentences. We meet
her. “I am so glad to see you.” Jespersen
suggests that this is an unfinished sentence
which would run thus: “I am so glad to see
you that I could jump for joy.” But before
Miss Flapper can finish the sentence a pass-
ing beau or a new hat attracts her atten-
tion, and she jerks out another muddled
thought. Aurora Leigh said: “A woman’s
function plainly is to talk,” and so slit;
gabbles away unthinkingly in a whirlwind
of words that mean nothing. She splutters
like a popgun—“Fancy that!, It’s lovely !
Not really”—with a sprinkling of “I mean
to say,” “You know what I mean.” In
short, women talk in blanks and exclama-
tion-marks. No doubt Gilbert Chesterton has
them in view when, apropos of Futurism, he
speaks of the Punctuist cult, whose compo-
sitions consist of colons and commas!
Perhaps their special qualities help them
to be this thing of shreds and patches. A
test mentioned by Romanes shows . that
women could pick up the sense of a quickly-
read prose passage more accurately than
men. This was no proof of intellectual
power, as some of the slowest readers were
distinguished men. Another test conducted
at an American University showed that while
the men used 1375 different words, their
female colleagues used only 1123. As Jes-
persen puts it, “The male period . is . often
like a set of Chinese boxes, one within an-
other. while the female period is like a
set of pearls joined together by a string of
‘ands’.” The trouble is that the pearls
are generally a cheap imitation.
Another injury women do is by the indis-
criminate use of adjectives and adverbs. A
comedian is “horribly amusing,” while a
new dress is “terribly nice.” The sundae
she is eating is “awfully sweet” ; so is her
friend’s latest frock or the Van Eyck paint-
ing. Adverbs thus lose their distinctive
value and become mere synonyms of “very.”
A sunset or a picture of Dore can be awful,
but an awful musical comedy is impossible.
Lady Battersea, in her “Reminiscences,” re-
lates that on meeting Tennyson her husband
said, grasping the poet’s hand and with a
beaming smile: “I am awfully glad to see
you, Mr. Tennyson, awfully glad.” “Young
man,” said the poet, “ ‘awfully’ is a word
you should not use in such a connection;
it is quite wrong ; pray, never do so again ;
you might as well say ‘I am glad to
see you’ ” (using an expletive that one little
expected such lips to make). Many adverbs
are so abused by minds too dull or. lazy to
appreciate the finer shades of. meaning that
the writer feels a qualm in using them. “A
blooming srirl” sounds silly, “an awful storm
weak. “Thrilling” and “intriguing,” both
very good words, become lifeless when they
are used for every incident, no matter how
trivial. Dorothy meets Prunella three times
a day. and each time she exclaims “How
thrilling!” Augustus sits out a dance with
.Tune, and all whisper “How intriguing!”
That this practice did not originate with
bobbed hair and the jerky fox-trot is shown
bv the words of Lord Chesterfield written in
1754: “A fine woman is vastly obliged, or
vastly offended, vastly glad or vastly sorry.
Large objects are vastly great, small ones
are vastly little; and I had lately the plea-
sure to hear a fine woman pronounce a very
small gold snuffbox, that was produced in
company, to be vastly pretty, because it was
so vastly little.”
The superior readiness of the speech of
women is thus a concomitant of the fact
that their vocabulary is smaller and more
central than that of men. It is a sign of
the division of labor between the sexes. Men
work: women talk. Men think; women
gush.
L. ROSS.
Criticism and the Arts
“Fewer good books are written about music
than the graphic arts.” writes “L.E. (K.I .
5/4,/’23). Speaking deferentially as an out-
sider interested in graphic art, but with
little knowledge of it. I should say the lack
of intelligible art criticism was remarkable.
There are numbers of men and women who
would like to be instructed in the principles
of painting so that they could tell good work
from bad. distinguish intelligently between
the various schools, and follow the develop-
raent of art, but where are they to go for
instruction ? In art where are _ the reliable
guides corresponding to Coleridge, Lamb,
llazlitt, Arnold, Chesterton and Quiller-
Couch in literature? There is Ruskin, but
though he is a great man he is diffuse, and
the artists tell us he is greater as a moralist
and an economist than as an art critic. Get-
ting Ruskin aside, the only book I have read
that, is at once really clear in its exposition
of principles and written with literary dis-
tinction is George Moore’s “Modern Paint-
ing,” and I have come across but one copy
of "it in a home. If there are good and rea-
sonably cheap guides to art, perhaps the
artists will direct us to them. It is signifi-
cant that H. H. Asquith, an admirable gen-
eral critic, remarks that, as a rule, it must
be said of art criticism that it “has a blight-
ing effect upon good writers” ; that it “has
been comparatively unproductive either in
speculative of in practical guidance” ; and that
it “consists to a large extent in the unulumin-
ating discussion of unreal problems in unin-
telligible language.” The bulk of “our
modern professors of aesthetic,” says Mr.
Asquith, “seem to spend their lives in always
beating the bush and never starting the
hare.’ We look in vain for guiding prin-
ciples in a jungle of jargon."’ Also, “The
plain man who seeks salvation with the art-
critics very soon finds that he has condemned
himself to wander in a blind and baffling
twilight of cloudy dogma and chaotic pre-
cept.”
I suppose the main trouble with both musi-
cal and art criticism as compared with liter-
ary criticism is that in the one case. you are
applying words to a non-lingual subject, and
in the other you are using words to explain
words. The literary critic has the enormous
advantage of being able to quote in a way
that can be at once understood. He can
illustrate his point by taking as many ex-
tracts as he likes, and of varying length, from
tile prose or verse he is discussing. The in-
telligent and sympathetic reader responds at
once. The critic knows he is certain
to start a thrill by quoting Keats’s “Night-
ingale” ode. The mechanical difficulties in the
way of quoting music or painting are obvi-
ous. There are people who can enjoy music
by reading it, but the average music-lover
gets his pleasure through the ear alone. The
writer of musical criticism knows that if be
prints a lyrical passage from a Beethoven
sonata the quotation will not appeal to
many. Have you ever noticed how few books
on music are to be found in. the homes of
musical people? The probability is that you
will find on their shelves no books about
music save one or two that have been used
by the daughters of the house in the passing
of their examinations.
ALAN E. MULGAN.
To W. B. Yeats
I love to think that, on a misty day.
The women working in the rushfields low
By the dim'shore may see your shadow go,
And cross their quiet breasts, and, turning,
say
One to another: “Passes he whose way
Deirdre the white has blessed; whose mus-
ings slow
Are fairy words, that whitely gleam and
blow
From the far stars” ; and, when at night
they pray
And raise their mourning chant for the
loved dead
Whose tales shine golden from the page you
penned,
Their benison will rest upon your head;
And, in the years that come before the end,
Your wistful songs to Mary will ascend
Though your quiet presence and your voice
be fled. .

“High Minds,” Courtesy and Truth
David McKee Wright has the last word :
The gentle and kindly statement of Jack Lindsay
(R.P. 17/5/’23) that he would “feel insulted” if I
did not misunderstand him is so rich with all the
abounding courtesy of the “high mind” that I sup-
pose I should merely bow my acknowledgments and
say “0 rare young man!” Unfortunately I do
understand him perfectly. Mr. Lindsay, on the
assumption that I had expressed as my own view
opinions which I merely quoted from Others, pro-
ceeded to give me a lofty lecture on the “high
mind,” in the course of which he said many things
that were ridiculous. He now attempts to cover his
retreat from that unwarranted and unprovoked
attack by a smothering mass of wordy common-
place. No one doubts that great men have shown
many eccentricities without losing their greatness;
no one doubts that little men continue to display
similar absurdities without achieving any touch of
greatness. Neither does anyone doubt that there is
a sharp line of demarcation between reasonable con-
troversy and the note of personal prejudice in which
Mr. Lindsay indulges.
But there is one passage in Mr. Lindsay’s article
which I cannot allow to go unchallenged. He de-
clares that I have “often stated that poetry has no
form and is constructed by some mysterious ‘sing-
ing’ power.” 1 have never stated anything of the
kind. In season and out of season I have stated the
exact opposite. If Mr. Lindsay will quote me without
reading what I have written he must expect to look
absurd. As every reader of the Red Page knows, 1
have insisted more upon form than any other writer
in Australia, and have attempted more often than
anybody else to show that rhythmic thought is
poetry. Again and again I have been assailed for
this. Only last year Mr. Frank Morton on the Red
Page made a special point of my metrical strictness,
which he considered too great. And now the amaz-
ing Mr. Lindsay actually takes my line of thought
as his own, assures me it is not mine, and accuses
mo of holding views in direct opposition to all I
have ever w ritten on the subject! Even as a mani-
festation of the eccentricities of the “high mind”
that seems a little bit over the odds.
Is Formlessness Art?
And a last word from Eardley Turner: —
Mr. Esson (R.P. 3/5/’23) diagnoses my case
exactly. In spite of a lifetime spent on the stage
I confess I still retain an almost childlike innocence.
Is it any wonder, then, that when Mr. Esson wrote
of “the so-called well-made play” (which “every-
body is tired of”) I innocently imagined that he
meant what he said—just that, no more and no
less. How was my infantile mind to grasp the fact
that in reality he was referring to “a definite piece of
theatrical mechanism,” or, in plainer English, the
machine-made play—a very different thing? When
he further explains that “the modern dramatist de-
mands a much subtler and sterner form than served
the purpose of the older literary stage-carpenters”
i.e., Scribe, Sardou, et hoc —he, of course, becomes
crystal clear. The feeblest mind could grasp his
meaning.
I, in my innocence, thought that Mr. Esson’s
championship of the newly-discovered German genius,
Georg Kaiser, whose play, “From Morn to Mid-
night,” he cited enthusiastically as “a good example
of expressionism in drama,” meant, if it meant
anything, that formlessness in play-writing was to be
commended. Hence my article.
And yet there may be something to be said in
defence of my attitude. I refrain from touching on
any of the details of Herr Kaiser’s precious scenario,
unfolded by Mr. Esson, merely remarking in passing
that innocents like myself would hardly appreciate
them. But 1 beg leave to quote Mr. Esson’s own
description of this “remarkable play.” It “is
divided into seven scenes. There is no plot, no
climax, no scene a faire ; and practically there is
only one leading character”! Tills, then, is the
kind of thing that Mr. Esson prefers to Pinero and
“the greatly over-rated playwrights of the bygone
Victorian age.” Was I —am I —so very innocent,
after all, I wonder?
Anyhow, it was good to be enlightened regarding
the phrase “a well-made play.” According to Mr.
Esson it is “a technical term used by dramatic critics
for 10 years.” I believe it, for I myself have often
heard it used in London, always, of course, in the
complimentary sense. Considerably more than 40
years ago a critical writer named Aristotle had
something to say about well-made plays. And the
wise old commentator also said this: “Art that de-
presses is merely bad art.” Coming down to the
present day, one of England’s most capable and most
modern dramatic critics (Mr. Walkley, of the Times)
remarked on one occasion: “Surely it is a common-
place that every art form is conditioned by its medium.
The shape, the structure, the points of inflection, the
perspective of a play are all determined by the
necessities of the theatre.” Innocent Mr. Walkley!
A Satchel of Books
Balloons, by Elizabeth Bibesco (Hurst and
Blackett). Erail stories mostly. The opening
souvenir of an old lady, treasuring the recollection
of a fine fellow who had given her about five
minutes in a crowded life, is gracefully written, and
there is some ironic point about the tale of the
affluent magazine hack who wrote a deep novel only
to be hailed as a Best Seller among the Heavy
reviewers. The fragment called “Le Seul Bien —”
is also commended for the authoress’s sharp under-
standing of her sex.
The New Race of Devils, by John Bernard (Anglo-
Eastern Publishing Co.). With a preface by our old
friend W. N. Willis. A piece of sensation-mongering
rather well done. Willis' explains that the author
was “for years interned in Germany as a close
prisoner of war,” where, naturally, he got on inti-
mate terms with “the inner circle or secret bodies of
German scientists.” Now—still quite naturally, of
course—he represents his intimate friends as having
worked towards the production of “a new race of
devils bred scientifically and relentlessly for the
one purpose, revenge upon their enemies,” though
some of us may suspect that the Hun in those days
didn’t realise that revenge for a licking was going
to be called for. It is all dreadful rubbish, though
the story itself, without Willis’s preface, wouldn’t
be half so bad. But probably it wouldn’t sell half
so well.
Out of Bondage, by Olive Mary Salter (Duck-
worth), is an anti-clerical novel which begins bril-
liantly, and contains much sound character-drawing
throughout, but ends on a note of unconvincing
tragedy. Here is the leitmotiv, as expressed by the
heroine, who has married a country vicar:—
“No, the truth is that the people don’t want the
priests—not now Every church is full of wiles to
get round that unpleasant fact: you try the sporting
parson who says ‘Damn’ without blushing and rides a
motor-cycle, and you try shorter sermons and danc-
ing in the church room, and lantern lectures, and
the whole result is the congregations diminish and
diminish... .You sit and scratch, scratch upon the
very surface of life itself, while millions go by you
and love and suffer and sing and die, and never know
the name of God and are the better for it.”
Regarded as a piece of special pleading designed to
show that England is tired of religion the book is a
failure. All it proves is that an individual who in
youth gets too much religion, or the wrong sort of
religious teacher, tends to weary of religion; and
that has been known since religion began.
The Path to Freedom, by Michael Collins (Talbot
Press of Dublin). A collection of lucid articles
written by Collins after the inauguration of the Irish
Free State; it may be regarded as his last will and
testament. The right of the Republicans to cling to
their ideal and to advance, it, if possible, was not dis-
puted by Collins, but rather the campaign of violence,
which made the realisation of this ideal impossible.
“A politician,” writes Collins, “is as strictly bound
by the limitations of his material as a painter or a
dramatist. By ignoring the human element he can
evolve fine-spun theories, but they will remain theories
on paper only.” Collins maintains that had the Repub-
licans succeeded in destroying the National Govern-
ment and reduced the country to anarchy, the blackest
crime in the national struggle of Ireland for freedom
would be associated with De Valera and his followers
—the English would come back, and would be wel-
comed back, and they would come, not as enemies, but
as the only protectors who could bring order and
peace to a distracted country. “A wrong road has
been taken to a right end. The complete fulfilment
of our full national freedom can only be won when
we are fit and willing to win it.” The black record
of the last twelve months gives the measure of unfit-
ness, and those who desire to wipe out that reproach
will find no better aid to the evolution of a sane
policy than this little contribution by Michael Col-
lins.
The Happy Wanderer, by Charles Godfrey Turner.
This Maoriland essayist, who died in England a
year ago, seems to have been a wanderer by pro-
fession, a writer by accident, a keen observer, and
a man much in love with life. The book of collected
work is curiously pleasing. The style Is full of
modern affectations —the verbless sentence and the
isolated phrase—but there is kindliness and color
everywhere. Turner had a large superficial knowledge
of many things; and he dresses the shop window pro-
fusely. Gems are mixed with tinsel and rays of
faded cloth with works of art; but it is all of a
nature to make the people i-n the street stop to
look, if only for a moment. He seemed more anxious
to please in his writings than to say anything. For
example:—
“Those people who read books about a place
advise that one should stand by the old church of
St. Mary’s steps: ‘Gazing up the steep cobbled
streets fringed with reeling houses, it is easy to
see in imagination the beaten Cavaliers, sword in
hand, stumbling frantically amid these tortuous
labyrinths as they seek refuge from the pursuing
conquerors of Worcester field?’ Just so; but I was
busy enjoying sundry groups of the dirtiest babies
in all the world. Healthy little beasts like them
played there before England decided to change from
one tyranny to another. Nor had the shouting
and the clamor of the fabled chase died down
before they crawled into the roads again to pretend
that they," too, were troopers. Really, you would
have liked the dear children I saw—they were so
delightfully dirty.”
That is very clever; but dirty children have been
popular for many years —on paper. The reader will
doubt very much whether the author really did
like the “dear children” and will suspect that he used
them only as a foil for the cathedral which he goes
on to describe; and the same is true of his immediate
descent from the cathedral to the cake-shop, the
best he had found in England. A few verses are
also published in the volume, and they, too, show
good craftsmanship.

Laughter.
Little gusts of laughter shake me,
Like the wind in an aspen-tree.
Folk regard me, ah, so gravely—
Owlish dears, but I walk bravely,
Folding laughter, lightly, tightly.
Round me like a garment brightly *
Wearing laughter like ft flower
Every day and every hour.
Thus I walk, ah me, so bravely }
Knowing folk regard me gravely
Just because Sweet laughter shakes me
Like the wind in an aspen-tree.

One Day.
I sometimes think God must find wearisome
The pomp and state which lie must always
keep
In that dim realm to which, when death’s
last sleep
Is past., the restless souls of men must come:
Knowing all things, seeing the worst and
best,
He would choose one place only for His
rest—
I like to think that, through the golden day*
On a great cliff above some southern bay,
With no companions but the sea and sky,
He lies and listens to the sea-birds’ cry,
Tasting His own peace till the sunbeams
die*
And evening’s magic vests the world in
grey.
I fancy that the mighty Truant sighs,
Returning to the cares of Paradise.

Morning at Manly.
The dew for day’s adorning
Hangs pearls on every tree;
The ocean beckons, singing
Her old song to the free,
And all the wide streets, going
Through guards of green, stretch glowing,
Long avenues of morning
That lead out to the sea.
The white wave-fingers, seeking
Night’s treasures, stir the sand;
Through misty gold uprisen
The shining headlands stand,
And watching pines aglisten
Stretch out green arms and listen
To myriad voices speaking—
They only understand.
Here pass all sordid sorrows,
The petty things that fret;
The very air is potent
To make the soul forget;
Till filled with joy of living
We sing the Song Thanksgiving
For all the golden morrows
That stretch before us yet.

Narrabeen at Sunset.
If you climb the ridges, out by Narrabeen,
When the sun is falling—
_ Rosy, round, enthralling—
You shall say: “Such beauty never yet was
seen.”
Purple grows the ocean, rosy grow the lakes
Through the green hills wending;
While, a sweetness lending
To the charm of color, sylvan song awakes.
Cattle lowly lowing, watching, you shall see
In the water-meadows;
And the lake-side shadows,
Slanting down, shall show you fern and filmy
tree.
Ryes and ears enchanted, captive you shall
stand,
Perfumed air-in-breathing,
While, from depths upwreathing,
Violet smoke shall dimly drift across the
land.
Butcher-birds in chorus, singing loud and
clear,
Doves together cooing,
And an axe-blade hewing
Fuel-wood or green-wood, list’ning you shall
hear.
You shall see far breakers fouutaining on
high,
While from reef and island,
Over low and high land,
Rosied by the sunset, homing gulls shall fiy.
Though you gaze enchanted, charmed in
mind and heart,
You shall yet feel sadness
Mingled with your gladness—
That you were not gifted with the painter’s
art

Retrospect.
When I look back upon the road behind
By which I’ve come, and all the paths that
wind,
This way and that, by which I might have
gone,
Instead of choosing this to lead me on,
I do not linger wastfully, nor yearn
Over each path’s inviting twist and turn,
Nor shed regretful tears my sighs between,
With aching heart for all that might have
been.
I scan the landscape with clear, happy eyes,
Rejoicing in the wide and windy skies,
The while I say a grateful little prayer,
Thankful that I have found a place so fair.

THE WRONG WAREHOUSE.
"The Bruce Government proposes to build several hundred miles of railway in State territory, although it has 523,620 sq. miles of its own Federal Territory undeveloped.”
S. M. BRUCE (merchant and Prime Minister) : “Here, what are you doing? They’re our goods, aren’t they? What are you taking them into another
firm’s place for?”
THE CARRIER: “Well, they’re friendly blokes, and I thought you, wouldn’t mind giving ’em a lift.”
(The subsequent remarks of Mr. Bruce are unprintable.)

IRRIGATION AND A DREAM.
Irrigation requires water —a simple matter
which is too often overlooked. It is
most wanted where there is no water to
irrigate with. And the extent to which it
has been carried, even in countries which
have much more water than Australia, is
greatly over-estimated. India is a land of
big mountains, big rivers, a great rainfall
in most parts, and a dry season which makes
water-conservation highly advisable. Its irri-
gation works were made with cheap labor,
and the business was spread over very many
hundred years. The irrigated space is
49,963,000 acres. Of this area nearly
13,000,000 acres are moistened by the very
cheap and intensely patient Hindu lifting-
water out of wells, and another 7,000,000 by
means of tanks. The record is magnificent,
for the ground covered approaches the dimen-
sions of Victoria. Still, it would provide
Carruthers’s Million Farmers with only 50
acres each, and the authorities put down the
value of the annual yield at much less than
£4 ' per acre. Egypt, with a great river
flowing down from great mountains as a
permanent resource, has been at work since
before Pharaoh. It has under cultivation
a little over 5.000,000 acres (a Million Farm-
er* at five acres each), and it is reckoned
that the Nile may run to 2,000,000 acres
more Even that final effort will make a
watered area of much less than half the
size ’ of Tasmania. Of our own country’s
biggest and oldest and most successful settle-
ment, Mildura, the official records say
briefly that “the area of the settlement is
45,000 acres, of which 13,000 acres are under
intense culture.” It is a business of garden-
ing on small allotments; and people who
talk in millions and picture vast irrigated
wheat farms and cattle stations, with kan-
garoos drowning in the flood, are stodgy
vote-hunters who discourse through their
hats.
* * * $
Australia’s great theoretical standby for
irrigation is the Murray-Darling-Murrum-
bidgee river system. All the theorists con-
centrate on the Murray. It gathers its
waters from four States. In N. S. Wales it
collects to its bosom 63 tributaries, and in
Victoria 49. From Queensland it gathers a
multitude, and in S.A. it gets an occasional
drop of rain. The valley of the Murray
reaches to Broken Hill, and covers 454,635
sq. miles, l'ract.cally all the irrigation yet
done lies in this valley, and though it hasn’t
made any visible impression on the 454,635
sq. miles, it already in bad seasous makes a
very obvious impression on the Murray. At
more than one spot irrigators were lately
ordered to leave off when they could least
afford to, in order that towns below might
have a drink. When all the vast works
planned under the Murray River agreement
are completed it is on the programme to
irrigate 1.400,000 acres in three States, and
if navigation was wholly abandoned and the
ocean fenced out, so that brine would not
crawl up too far and spoil the farms, some
more could be done. But in no ordinary
year could the Murray combination do half
enough to justify the programmes which poli-
ticians harness to it. In its last 450 miles
or so it receives no tributaries, and is really
a dying watercourse, so far as fresh water
is concerned, like the inland rivers which go
off in steam during the struggle to reach
Lake Eyre. Of course, as the Murray be-
comes less of a river, owing to the demands
of irrigation or other causes, it will find com-
oensation by becoming more of an estuary in
its lower reaches; but estuaries are not good
material to grow crops with.
There are possibilities in a small way
around the fringes of the Lake Eyre basin
(495,190 sq. miles), but, except in the high-
lands about the Macdonnell Ranges, evapora-
tion proceeds apace, and after a moderate
amount of travel even a big river finds that
it has its work cut out to irrigate itself. The
devil of evaporation in a dry climate, which
makes water, especially when spread out,
vanish like an absconding bankrupt, is too
much left out of the calculations of the
people who irrigate volubly in city clubs and
smoking-rooms. A case akin to that of a
great part of Australia may be found in
Palestine. The Jordan is only about 125
miles long as the crow flies, but in that
space it does a greater drop than the Mis-
sissippi does in its entire length. It is 150 ft.
wide in places and 21ft. deep in places, and
this mass of water naturally wastes no time
on the way. A lot of minor streams assist
it to make the Dead Sea —which is no very
big lake, after all—and none of the waters
of that deeply-sunk waterhole are wasted in
drinking or irrigation, for they are brine.
Yet evaporation uses them up apparently
faster than they can be replenished, for local
opinion is that the Dead Sea is losing
ground. An idea also prevails in hazy but
well-meaning quarters that artesian bores
have only to be turned on to make unlimited
desert blossom like the rose. The entire out-
put of all the known bores of Australia
(figures for 1920-21) would have kept 10
cities the size of Sydney metropolitan area
in drinking water, provided the demand
didn’t increase, and provided bore water was
drinkable or even safe to pour over plants.
But of Queensland, where three-fourths of the
artesian supply comes from, the Federal
Statistician says briefly
The waters of many of the wells have been analysed,
and some found suitable for wool-scouring only.
Others are suitable for watering stock, but not for
irrigation, owing to the presence of alkali. Others
again serve both for stock and irrigation, while
some, such as those containing sulphuretted hydro-
gen, are not of any use. Waiter fit for stock may
oenerally be said to be safe for domestic purposes
despite its slightly mineral taste.
That is the best of the artesian areas. So
any large and general artesian irrigation idea
is unhappily out of court.
* « • *
Every stupendous scheme of Government
irrigation, combined with railway-building
and stupefying loans, serves a purpose in
keeping Claptrap, M.P., in the public eye.
If by any horrible contingency one of his
schemes was adopted and the colossal fraud
put in charge with colossal sums to play
with, it would take 20 years to prove the
failure, and Claptrap, M.P., would probably
be dead or out of the line of vision in 20
years. On the other hand, practical pro-
’ jects for creating the many manufacturing
industries that the country requires don’t
offer the same hopes of large financing; and,
besides, failure has a habit of speedily com-
ing home to roost. So Claptrap sticks to
the fine-sounding things whose results can’t
be quickly audited.
THE CULT OF HATRED.
The proposal of the Church of England
bishops to delete some of the more violent.
Biblical imprecations is a straw which
shows the way the modern wind is blowing:
Let death come hastily upon them, and let them
go down quick into Hell.
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths.
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the ven-
geance; he shall wash his footsteps in the blood of
the ungodly.
The* world has been living in that kind
of atmosphere for over eight years now, and
largely as a result civilisation is tottering
everywhere, and over large tracts of once-
pros'perous country it has collapsed _ and the
inhabitants are reverting to barbarism. In
actual war-time, no doubt, .the inculcation of
hatred is an unpleasant national necessity
for two related reasons: the average edu-
cated man has little natural capacity for the
emotion (“How can I hate him/’ asked
Charles Lamb, “when I have met him?”),
and without violent hatred of the enemy
armies are unable to acquire and retain
moral. Many of the bishops who now want
the imprecatory sentences removed taught
throughout the war that it was the dutv of
Gcn-fear ; ng Britishers to “wash their foot-
steps in the blood of the ungodly” (meaning
Germans), and. according to the Quaker
John Grahams M.A. (“Conscription and
Conscience”), the clergy were among the bit-
terest enemies of his sect. But churchmen of
the best type do not carry this spirit into
the peace period and strive to make it opera-
tive between classes, parties and dehomina-
tions of the same nationality. They are to
be commended for their restraint, since
notoriously the simplest and surest way for
a cleric, politician or any other public char-
acter to collect a following of a sort is by
devoting his energies to stirring up resent-
ment against the following of somebody else.
A clergyman left Bathurst (N.SAA.) last
month with the remark that but for the help
of one or two friends he would be bankrupt.
He had ministered there for many years, but
had never attacked any of the rival creeds.
If he had adonted the unscrupulous and un-
Christian line of the professional sectarians,
he would probably have had no cause to worry
about his finances.
The nominal object of Empire Day is to
draw the warring constituents of the nation
closer together, and so enable it to face the
world a more efficient, because a more har-
monious, unit. In practice, the celebrations
are regularly exploited by political and cleri-
cal adventurers who no more want peace with
their enemies inside Australia than a cer-
tain class of war-contractor wanted peace
with Germany in 1918. East Empire Day
in Australia was like many of its predeces-
sors. Defenceless children were addressed
by gentlemen who, with a few exceptions,
either made no serious effort to serve the
Empire when it most needed help, or
whose offers of assistance were so belated
or hedged about with conditions as to be
valueless. In practically every case the ora-
tions of these sorry patriots were as impre-
catory as they could be. There was no sug-
gestion that the time had come to stop
snarling; no suggestion that the true Empire
man was he who laid himself out to oil the
machinery of State, rather than throw sand
into the works. The sermons retailed to the
children were largely of the “break their
teeth in their mouths” order —thunderous
demands that those who did not see eye to
ey-e with them should be hounded down or
out. The Empire has plenty of enemies and
potential enemies outside its borders without
exacerbating bitterness inside them. A
proper and imperially useful course for an
Empire Day speaker vjould, therefore, have
been- to point out that Australia is shirking
its defence obligations. The A.1.F., he might
have explained, is not only demobilised but
disarmed. If its services were required again
it would have to be equipped and munitioned
by Britain. The R.A.N. has been reduced
virtually to three light cruisers, three de-
stroyers and half-a-dozen auxiliaries —a fleet
totally inadequate to defend Australia’s sea-
borne trade. The business of looking after
our sea-trade (which represents our commer-
cial life) and our coastal defence (which
means our national life) devolves accordingly
on the taxpayers of Britain, whose burden is
already as much as they can bear. If the
Empire is to hold together all this must be
altered. It is shameful to Australia as a
self-respecting country that emerged from
the war in a comparatively favorable condi-
tion financially, and it is grossly unfair to
the United Kingdom. And those are the
arguments that Empire orators would have
put before their audiences were it not that
the stirring up of hatred is better business
from their standpoint than the fostering of
a spirit of goodwill.
* * * *
There is hardly one aspect of - social life in
which some form of hatred is not found
obscuring the issue to the detriment of the
nation. For years the doctors have been
urging the necessity of eliminating V.D. But
if V.D. is ever to be scotched, as the plague
and small-pox have been, it will require to
be attacked as uncompromisingly as they
were. In the nature of things the most easily
identifiable distributors of V.D. are. women.
And so the feminists, who are mainly suf-
ferers from sex-jealousy, see in every move
made in the direction of V.D. reform a mas-
culine design to dominate and insult Woman,
and they fight each proposal as it comes up.
They do not reflect that women and children
who* have never sinned are often the worst
sufferers from the present anarchic condi-
tions ; they are too annoyed at the thought
of their sex being discriminated against in
gaols, in lock hosptals, anywhere, to be cap-
able of approaching the problem with level
minds. Who that has followed a prohibi-
tion campaign—the last one in M.L., for
example—can avoid the conviction that there
is bigotry on both sides? The addresses
poured forth are as violent as those of so
many anarchists or Empire Day speakers.
It may be demonstrated that, whereas drink-
reform has everywhere minimised drunkenness,
the attempt to abolish alcohol has nowhere
succeeded, and has in many places proved
disastrous. (Dr. Hubbard, of the New York
Department of Health, is the latest to pro-
duce figures showing that in the most popu-
lous State of the Union, the Volstead amend-
ment has had tragic results.) The only effect
on the prohibitionist is to make him more
violent, abusive and irreconcilable than ever.
Similarly with those who want to prohibit
gambling. Refusing to see things except with
the eye of the fanatic —who sees only what
his disordered brain wants him to see —they
oppose the totalisator, which discourages big
betting, and fight the battle of the book-
makers and the S.-P. shops—institutions
which are to blame for thousands of ruined
homes and as many criminals. In the days
when the world was normal psychologically,
and rich in the material sense, nations could
afford to indulge in the luxury of internal
dissension ; though even in pre-war days cer-
tain industrial and sectarian trouble-makers
were beginning to be recognised as public
dangers. In the present delicate, not to
say. hideously perilous, state of things, the
man who for his own political or financial
ga ; n lays himself out to set the hands of
one section of Australians against another
section is playing as dastardly a part as that
of a traitor to his country in war-time.
POST-MORTEM.
The only practical thing to do now is to
diagnose the trouble which led to the over-
whelming defeat of the parties opposed to
Theodore in the Queensland election; for
without a correct diagnosis no treatment is
likely to succeed. Wherefore The Bulletin
presents the observations of four men, each
representative of a large section of Queens-
land opinion.
* * * *
The conclusions of an ex-Minister, who is
now content to be an onlooker:—
The debacle must have been specially designed by
Heaven as a warning to political cold-footers and
shirkers. There never was an Opposition more wary
of giving offence. It deplored Theodore’s extrava-
gance, it is true. It denounced proxy voting, con-
demned State Enterprises, deplored wild-cat finance,
and was as good an Opposition as the Lord ever
made just as long as it had to deal with mere criti-
cism. But the moment people queried: “Well,
what would you do?” the Opposition was a dumb
dog. It commended economy in a general way,
but declined to say how it would economise. It
spoke scathingly of the maladministration of the
railways, with their 3000 superfluous wage-worriers,
but it did not dare to say it would sack a single
parasite. Many of the Opposition candidates, in
fact, condemned retrenchment. Of course, they were
out to put the finances right, but how they were
going to manage it when they were at the same
time denouncing any extra taxation, no one could
make out. The State Enterprises came in for vigor-
ous trouncing, but never a candidate would shut
up the useless butcheries, or get rid of the hopeless
State Produce Agency, or cut out the State cattle'
stations, or take drastic measures for getting rid
of the army of loafers whose free rations are cost-
ing Queensland nearly £200,000 per annum. There
never was such an inoffensive Opposition. It wouldn’t
hurt anybody, it couldn’t. In fact, if the Opposition
attitude amounted to anything at all it simply meant
that if elected it would displace Theodore and then
let things slide. If a party can’t be brave enough to
talk the straight thing on the hustings, it will
never be brave enough to do the straight thing when
it comes to occupy the Treasury benches. Pure
negation never attracts any enthusiasm and without
some enthusiasm a party’s cake is dough. No greater
lesson to trimmers and shirkers was ever given.
* * * *
Randolph Bedford writes from the win-
ner’s camp:—
The job was too much like shooting sitting ducks;
using a machine-gun on a goat tied to a fence.
Newspapers opposed to us are busy finding reasons
for our victory. To the people not blinded by
party, the facts are no surprise. Absence of leader-
ship on the anti-Labor side was not such a factor
as absence of policy; and that three of the men
marked for seats in the Tory Cabinet placed a
funeral wreath on the doorstep of T. J. Ryan two
years before his death did not help them to vic-
tory. As to the talk of 60,000 “ghosts” on the
electoral rolls, there was not one case of imper-
sonation. These 60,000 alleged ghosts are as harm-
less as if they were in a directory. The truth is
that the Federal rolls in Queensland are imperfect;
there is not continuous action in formation or puri-
fication of rolls, and little interest in them until
immediately before an election, when the work is
done hurriedly and badly. The gerrymandering of
electorates is not true, either. The Commission
fixed a 40 per cent, adjustability of the quota—a
very necessary thing in the big State where one
or two electorates are each as largo as Victoria.
After the rolls, Opposition dissension is blamed. But
if the Opposition had been solid, its stupidity would
have been even more conspicuous. The speeches of
Vowdes became mere abuse of the alleged United
party.
The mediocrity of Opposition candidates was not
a great factor, because many of .the defeated Oppo-
sition candidates are able men compared with many
Opposition candidates returned. Nicholson, of Mt.
Elliott, one of the best-known, most capable and
most popular men in the Nor’-West, made a poor
showing in Flinders. In the adjoining Gregory, at
Dijarrah and another booth, there were 109 votes
cast, and every one was for Pollock, the Labor man.
The cries of “Bolshevism,” of “Red objective” and
of the “Repudiation Act,” the condonation and
justification of bribery, and the later cries of “the
grand old flag” and the “dear old Motherland” were
heard—and disregarded. Huxham, Minister for Edu-
cation, lost not a vote because he stopped the silly
saluting of the grand old flag by school children
acting under duress. The issue of restoration of
the Leg. Council did not catch a vote; one ex-
Councillor, Fowles, an anti-Labor candidate, was
defeated with great slaughter.
Labor had as allies the superior industrial condi-
tions of the State; the protection of sugar farmers
that tied every Northern electorate to itself; the
farmer legislation which will, at next time of ask-
ing, give many new seats in South Queensland to
Labor; the bribery case and its impudent justifica-
tion ; the disgust of many with the methods of
private insurance trying to “fix” its State competi-
tor politically ; the blind hatred of foreign pastoral-
finance cos. working for a return to rental advan-
tages over the good Australian on the lands. “Black”
Barwell helped a little; so did a few wild par-
sons who preached anti-Labor; so did the scrapping
of State enterprises in N. S. Wales, and the sale
of the Commonwealth w r oollen mills—worth at least
£500,000, on a 10 years’ purchase of their annual
profits of £50,000 —and sold to a Flinders-lane
syndicate for £155.000, payable over 10 years. And
there was also the fact that some of the loudest
local shriekers against State Enterprise had tried
to unload rotten properties, such as inferior coal-
mines, on to the Government, even to attempt to
bribe responsible officials.
We were called Bolshevik when we are merely
Australians, one-eyed for our country, and not likely
to wait for any foreign Labor movement that i-
politically 50 years behind us. And more than for
any other reason, because we are Australians with
a real Australian policy we won.
It was a triumph of organisation without money.
That nothing minimises Theodore’s excellent work
and high mm a; he is a big man, and I believe tlwi
the highest position in Australia is his when be
and circumstances choose. Meantime he will fee
this Parliament and its programme to a finish. The
solid importance of the man is seen in the gradual
lessening of press abuse of him, as the Hymn of
Hate against Labor itself ris£s in shrill crescendo.
Still young, able, modest, physically and mentally
strong, he appeals to popular imagination; his seem-
ing austerity helping the idea that he is super-
man. T. J. Ryan — : most lovable of men —was of
warm heart and warm brain ; Theodore is of warm
heart and cold brain.
We won, then, because we know a little and be-
lieve something; our opponents were routed because
they know less and believe nothing.
The third contributor, conspicuous in one
of the defeated parties, is brief: —
Nothing but the re-education of the electorates will
do. The defeated parties are blamed for not having
put forward policies of a definite character. In the
present state of Queensland they could not have won
on any policy to which responsible men would care
to attach their names. We have got into a bad war.
Self-seeking is almost universal. Everybody is out
to fill his pockets. And in those circumstances what
effective appeal could be made to the non-attached
voters in whose hands the result of almost er ere-
election lies? We could have beaten Labor only by


outbidding them. It is deplorable; and it can only
be met by continuous campaigning. He can o*uy
win three years hence by starting now.
Finally, a keen politician whose position
will no longer allow him to take part in the
fight.:—
The main reasons apart from the “arrangement” of
the electorates were: (1) Theodore's personality
and able campaign; (2) the adroit distribution of no-
madic voters ; (3) the country’s lack of confidence in
the Opposition leaders and their tactics. Apart from
Theodore’s capitally arranged campaign, in which
he swept down from Cairns through all the doubtful
districts of the coast and immediate hinterland (the
Far West being impregnable for Labor), and finished
up in the agricultural districts of the Burnett, More-
ton and the Darling Downs, the third reason is the
most cogent.
Theodore had kept this election constantly in
view during past sessions; and everything that was
done was at least capable of being used to influence
votes. This is specially notable in collection with
his bid for the farmers’ support. llis opponents had
nothing to set against this, probably because they
lacked a commanding personality.
Certainly the dice were loaded against them. It is
vain to say that the tremendous disproportion of
State and Federal voters on the roll was of no con-
sequence, and that if there were “ghosts” they did
not vote. They did not need to vote to be effective.
You can get an unfair number of members in a
“safe” part of the country by bloating the rolls:
the “ghosts” don’t have to vote, they have done
their work by securing a member where no member
should be. This is the worst feature of an election
which otherwise failed to interest hundreds of people.
Theodore, for the sake of his own good name,
should have it independently and searchingly in-
quired into.
NOT A REPUBLICAN JUST AT
PRESENT.
Thebe was more horse-sense than he knew
in the words of that State Minister who lately
put his most impressive ban on the teaching
of Republican doctrines in schools under his
control. It is possible to be wise by mistake,
and I think he did it to the point of almost
impossible sagacity. Theoretical Republican-
ism can’t be taught to the young and impres-
sionable without many of them mistaking it
for the practical article, and the practical
specimen is dangerous just now. It would
be dangerous even if it was honest, genuine
Republicanism, and not what its most bellow-
ing and persistent apostles plainly intend it
to be—something after the A.L.P. executive
fashion, a thing of secret caucuses and sub-
terranean engineering, of spasms and coups
d'etat, with the promptest Robespierre or
Tbo'tsky, or the Cromwell with the best
military capacity, climbing to the head of
affairs, and remaining there till dragged down
by the hair of his dome of thought. In other
words, something on land like the spacious
buccaneering days at sea, when there were
prizes for the bold and for those who got
there first. Assuming that it is no# proposed
that Australia should be a sham republic in-
side an empire, as Hamburg w T as inside the
German Empire (and, if Hamburg is any
criterion, that would be having less than we
have now), the establishment of the proposed
institution must imply separation unless the
Empire turns republic also. And an empire
which is mostly nigger can't unless it cuts
most of its property adrift, or else submits
to be ruled by its nigger. In fact, the great
majority of the present advocates of a change
regard separation from the Empire as the
first essential, and the establishment of any
republic which would interfere with profit-
able and joyous robbery as no essential at
all.
I was a Republican myself of the Jeffer-
son variety 40 years ago. I am not one at
present, but that is merely on business
grounds. There was quite a large Republican
party in Australia 40 years ago, not in the
least counting Bolsheviks, Communists and
Anarchists, if such existed. The more seri-
ous believers didn’t want their republic untii
there was more population and organisation
to defend it, but they hoped that every year
would see it visibly a little nearer. The
States, regarded as communities which had
taken most of their destiny in their own
hands, were very young then, and seemed
to have lots of destiny ahead —very bright
destiny and not far ahead. Dating from the
appointment of their first Responsible Gov-
ernment, Victoria was the eldest sister, being
aged 27|. N. S. Wales, S. Australia and
Tasmania were over 26. Queensland was a
blushing flapper of 23. Westralia wasn’t
born’ yet, but was expected. They all looked
promising, and there was plenty of time,
and more space even than time, for more
children like them to come to light. Aus-
tralia was beginning its existence in its south-
east corner, as the United States began in the
north-eastern one, but abundant opportunity
existed for expansion.
The expansion didn’t arrive worth 2d., or,
at least, not worth 3Jd. There are no new
States or new capitals (the United States
has established nine in the same time), and
the same old line, from a little above Bris-
bane to a little above Perth, remains the
northern limit of any settlement worth men-
tioning. The old capital cities which the
British authority founded- in Crown Colony
days and left behind it because it couldn’t
carry them away, have expanded well enough.
In fact, as The Bulletin has already
pointed out, both Melbourne and Sydney
gained more new population between the
last two censuses than the whole of Scotland
did (Sydney gained more than twice as
much), and the four minor capitals, taken
togethei-, beat the ancient kingdom badly.
Our country has such a marvellous capacity
in this line that it would probably have twice
the population it has if it had only estab-
lished enough State capitals, and thus turned
to account the knack in which it can put up
such scores on any kind of wicket. And
England, which (apart from Wales) put up
the world’s record, on census day, of 701
inhabitants to the sq. mile, has oodles of
population to spare if Australia only found
some place to put them. An Australian repub-
lic might make some kind of a show with
less than double the existing population if
what it had was judiciously spread out, but
it doesn’t spread worth 4^d.
I believe that any person advocating a
republic here should be discouraged even if
it were an orderly and ideal republic he pro-
pounds, and much more so if there is reason
to imagine that he aims at the Russian or
Mexican species. I would put him down,
not according to any piffle about high trea-
son, but because lunatics ought not to be
at large, and attempted suicide in a public
place is nasty. Quite an extensive section
of the world would sit up and take more
notice than it ever took before if this
land announced that it had abjured the pro-
tection of the Empire (which may not be
worth so much as it looks, but it looks a
lot), and announced that there was no one
to argue with but itself. Since Australia
began to manage its own affairs in great part,
it has added 64 years to the period that can
be adduced as proof that our title to 60
per cent, of the continent has lapsed for lack
of effective occupation. And many other
nations have increased by 100 to 300 per
cent, their reasons, because of that neces-
sity which knows no law and doesn’t care if
it did. for declaring that the title has lapsed,
provided there are insufficient guns to argue
to the contrary. In other words, science has
been doing things never dreamt of before in
the way of reducing the death-rate and pre-
serving population, including cripples,
dwarfs, mental deficients and sundries—
doing things calculated to make angels weep.
The globe is growing full at a rate which
suggests that it soon won’t have the least
idea what to do with itself or where to go
unless it goes to Australia.
The United States, when it first figured
out its population, found it had less than
4,000,000 souls to worry about. It has now
about 107,000,000, and the change may be
said to have occupied only two lifetimes.
Henry Clay, the great orator and states-
man, was born during Washington's war,
and years before Robespierre’s cheery re-
volution. He died at a great age, and six
years before his death Livingston Hop-
kins (“Hop,” of The Bulletin), who is
still going strong, was born. When so much
is done in two lifetimes, with years to spare,
the world is being used up fast. Even since
1860, which doesn’t wholly cover the self-
governing era in- Australia, the population of
the United States has grown by 70,000,000,
or 200 per cent. In places the crowded feel-
ing has already set in. This is largely due
to immigration; yet England and Italy,
which export population to the ends of the
earth, have also doubled their census re-
turns since Australia’s first Responsible
Government was formed, and they were rea-
sonably full before. Prussia, before the war
reduced its area and damaged its calcula-
tions, was busy with an effort to double its
census each 50 years, so that 24 million folk
might become 96 millions in one century and
384 millions in another. Japanese figures
don’t extend far enough back to allow of
similar "calculations, but Japan seems to be
another case like Prussia, and it is nearer.
Java, nearer still, has been doubling its millions
every 35 years. Nations embarrassed by this
orgy of human flesh would almost infallibly
drop in to see our new republic, when they
learned that Australia had no longer any
relations, and not even a sort of calculating
friend in the shape of a Monroe Doctrine,
and that its defence arrangements had drifted
back to their old pre-war inefficiency or
worse. There will probably be a call in any
case, but the announcement of complete iso-
lation would bring somebody for certain, ij;
might bring everybody. Therefore, it seems
unwise to be a Republican just at present,
except perhaps in the most theoretical sense.
JAMES EDMOND.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“Experts” and Old Ruts.
Items ooze through from the Northern Ter-
ritory about the proceedings of Senator
Pearce, that long-distance political institu-
tion who is now in his ninth blameless but
undistinguished portfolio. He went via
Queensland so that he could be seen on the
way by Theodore, who aims at annexing the
railway that S. Australia paid for; and he
will come back the same way so that he may
confabulate further with the same persuasive
personality. This is the latest condensed
report:—
In respect of oil and cotton the Federal Govern-
ment would do everything possible. The geological
expert could not get away from [word doubtful, but
one place is as good as another for an expert to
get away from] until the wet season of the Territory,
so it had been arranged for him to go to the Terri-
tory as soon after "as possible. Arrangements had been
made with the Queensland Government for a cotton
expert to visit the Territory in July to report
on the best localities... .He had had estimates pre-
pared of the cost of laying a telegraph line from
Barkly Tableland to Cunnamulla (in Queensland).
The cost would be about 1160,000... .It was a
national duty to keep smiling....
So it appears that it is to be only a case of
more “experts” pottering round in the costly
footling old way which maketh the heart
sick. When Westralia bailed up the Federal
Government years ago, nobody had the
effrontery to offer it an oil expert. Big JOHN
Forrest would have thrown his portfolio at
somebody’s head to avenge the insult. West-
ralia got its railway promptly, also a special
tariff and a cash grant for a term of years—
but, then, it had votes with which to throw
out the Ministry if it didn’t get its price
and a large political engineer to manipulate
the votes. The other day the Government
of Bruce and Page found a gap—the one on
the line leading to Hay (N.S.W.). It wasn’t
in Federal territory and it wasn’t their gap,
and they were under no obligation about it.
But, apparently thinking that the act would
buy friends in N. S. Wales, which has
votes to sell, they promptly proposed filling
it at the cost of all the States —not with a
cotton expert, but with a railway. According
to the rules of the political game (so long
as it is only a game) the Commonwealth’s
splendid estate will get nothing but experts
till it has votes to grease Ministers with, and
it will have no votes to grease with while
it gets nothing but experts, so the situation
is a deadlock. Oil isn’t found by sending
public officials to look for a needle in a
wilderness of haystacks, but if settlers come
in plenty it finds itself, supposing there is oil.
Cotton doesn’t boom by the advent of erudite
persons to diagnose the very best spot, and
lecture about the exact difference between it
and the second-best spot. People are likely
to arrive when the distance to the nearest big
centre is a matter of days instead of months ;
when there is promise that produce will get
away and not rot on Darwin wharf; and
when freehold land is offered them- —as a gift,
if that is necessary, to begin with. Then
the expert may be useful to give them points,
but points turned adrift in a wilderness are
of no value. It is just like the mouldy old
times that the Bruce-Page Government
should announce loan schemes amounting to
some £45,000,000 for the benefit of the south-
ern one-fifth of the continent, where the
States should be old enough to hustle for
themselves, while the north, which is its
direct responsibility, is , promised a cotton
expert, also an oil expert to arrive after the
wet season, and a possible telegraph line to
a hamlet in Queensland.
Peace-time Censorship.
The prohibition by some anonymous and
apparently uneducated Customs officer of Dr.
Marie Stopes’s, “Married Love” and “Wise
Parentage” is another indication that the
war is still with us in spirit, if not in fact.
Both books received high praise from leading
British doctors and reviews. “But,” the
Customs man may say, “they are porno-
graphic, and it ik my jofi to keep such litera-
ture out of the 'Country.?’ The person who
can dredge pornography out of a medical text-
book is capable of being stirred to evii
thoughts by a modern barmaid. Let it be
assumed, however, that Dr. Stopes’s books
are improper in the Sunday-school sense of
the word. Where is the business of guarding
the Australian intellect from the polluting
touch of literature to stop? At present
anyone can buy for a few shillings the works
of one of the Restoration dramatists. Will
any rational map have the hardihood to sug-
gest that for genuine immorality—suggestive-
ness carried to the nth degree, and promiscu-
ousness condoned, not to say advocated —
the most plain-spoken treatise Havelock
Ellis ever wrote approaches “The Country
AVife” or “The Gentleman Dancing-Master”?
Every public library and many second-hand
bookshops contain matter as dangerous as the
last-named —if plain speech is dangerous.
Boccaccio, who was recently banned, and
who is under a partial interdict still, is not in
if for filth with Wychebly. So that on the
moral side the protection afforded the public
is purely fortuitous—a matter of whether or
no a Customs employee happens to have
heard that a given writer is pornographic.
There is a social as well as a moral side
to the Stopes case. Her books advocate
birth-control. \A r hether birth-control is or
is not commendable, and in the best in-
terests of the nation, taking circumstances
into account, is at least a matter for opinion.
Churchmen as great as Dean Inge are to be
found who approve of it. The Dean believes
that an adequately supported family of 'two
or three has a better chaiice of salvation, and
is likely to do greater service to the State,
than one of 10 dr 12 whfch has been reared
under conditions of squalor and semi-starva-
tion. This aspect apart, it can hardly be
denied that if consumptives, syphilitics and
other diseased persons are to be ailowed to
marry, as at present, it is desirable from
every standpoint that they should not have
children. Such are the problems that Dr.
Stopes handles in her books. And it is not
a great doctor or body of professional
opinion that says the public must not listen
to argument on the question, but an irre-
sponsible Customs employee, or several of
them. Throughout the war this same idiotic
principle was followed. Someone was taken
(usually an influential eligible with no desire
to die) , labelled “Censor” and given the full-
est powers to decide what the nation should
or should not hear about the war. Under
this haphazard system lies about thousands
of Russians proceeding to the Western
Front through England were passed, and
the truth about the shell-shortage was cen-
sored. Then the shell-shortage censorship
was raised as regards the United Kingdom,
but maintained in Australia. English
papers were allowed to criticise the court-
martial system, but Australian papers which
did likewise were censored. The Bulletin
clipped an article from the Sydney Tele-
graph, and had it put into type. The Tele-
graph’s censor had passed it; The Bulle-
tin’s struck it out. The Sunday Times
submitted the picture of ,a warship taken
from a German paper. It was censored on
the ground that the enemy mustn’t know
what that warship looked like. In short, there
was neither intelligence nor uniformity. And
that is what is wrong with our Customs cen-
sorship. If it is necessary, then it should
be in the hands of citizens of standing, in-
tellectually and professionally equipped to
perform their mediaeval duties with the
minimum of offence to an up-to-date com-
munity.
Apprentice Wives, and the Unmarried
Girls’ Union.
Unionism has advanced with wonderful
strides in Australia, but there is still room
for the feet of progress to hustle in seven-
league boots over regions hitherto unex-
plored. Vast possibilities can be found in
the idea of an Unmarried Girls’ Union, the
qualifications of membership in which would
be three: (1) Being white, which is fre-
quent, but not so frequent as it should be;
(2) being a girl, which comes naturally to
many people; and (31 being unmarried,
which happens to every girl some time in her
life. The chief business of the normal girl
is to become a wife and, within reasonable
limits, to be a motner. but not to be *n abso-
lute rabbit in the latter respect. Therefore
the unmarried girl is a sort of apprentice
wife, and should be enrolled, if she and her
parents have any sense of the fitness of
things, as a member of the Unmarried Girls’
Union. AVhen she registered at the union’s
office as an unemployed member it would
mean that she wanted a job as a wife, and
then the position would begin to resemble tne
present N. S. Wales coal difficulty, and still
more the chronic shipping difficulty. The
owners have gone so far as to claim that they
should employ whom they please, while the
union claims to supply employees, and if the
man whose name has come up to the top of
the list isn’t accepted, business stops all
along the line till he is provided for. The man
at the head of the list may be unattractive
in many ways, but that makes no difference
while he is at the head of the list. Now, in
matrimonial matters the husband certainly
seems to rank as the employer in a rather
aggravated form. He selects the girl. She
promises to obey him, and often he sees that
she does it. He gives her a new name. She
works for him on his premises for an uncer-
tain wage, and even lives on the premises,
where she often saves the expense of a watch-
dog. There are many anomalies in the
casual ways of the marriage game, but one
of the worst is that the employee isn’t en-
gaged at the office of the Unmarried Girls’
Union, where the applicant for a house-
keeper, companion and mother should be pro-
vided with the girl at the top of the list if
she would have him. If she said flatly that
she wouldn’t have him, or if she said she
would, but failed to turn up, she would be
within her rights, though her action might
be regarded as disorderly. The union
wouldn’t be bound to supply another girl, but
if it did the employer, would have no more
option than before. On the other hand, if
the wife-employer refused to marry what
was supplied by the secretary of the Un-
married Girls’ Union, perhaps alleging in-
competence, untidiness, bad temper, igno-
rance and general ugliness, he would
simply be told that she was a finan-
cial member in good standing, and that
was the end of it. If he persisted
he would, of course, be declared “black,”
and might be reduced to losing caste for
mi cohabitation with a non-unionist.
4 he mdy, being still at her ojd place on the
list and still a financial member of the
U.G.U., would be offered to further appli-
cants. But if she was so disagreeable-look-
ing that those whom she would take wouldn’t
take her, but preferred to take the conse-
quences; and if those who would take her
were so mean-looking that she wouldn’t take
them (m her case there would be no conse-
quences), she might congest the marriage
market for months, after the manner of a
fat elephant stuck in a doorway, and, hold-
ing up the traffic, she might do serious
damage to the birth-rate. Still, it is worth
while making some sacrifice for the principle
that labor should be engaged solely through
the union, and that no unionist should be
‘victimised” and refused his (or her) turn
for a voyage on the_ sea of life or any other
patch of water simply because employers
have a dislike to him (or her). And the
present haphazard method, under which the
girl doesn’t even produce her union ticket
when asked the momentous question, hasn’t
given such marvellously good results that
one need weep over its loss.
Vesteys and the N.T.
Dear Bulletin, —When C. W. D. Con-
acher, general manager for Vestey Bros.’
interests in the Northern Territory (which
interests include a number of subsidiary cos.
registered under various titles), notified the
A.W.U. that the works were about to close,
Harold Nelson, the secretary, now M.H.R.,
asked whether the rate of wages was the
cause. Mr. Conacher replied “No.” I
sought confirmation of this from Mr. Con-
acher, and got it. The co. had always paid
the rate of wages prevailing, he said, and,
though there had been differences between
employers and men concerning modes and
methods, the pay was not disputed. The cost
of living in Darwin was so high, Mr. Con-
acher added, that the co. had established
its own store, furnished its employees with
food and necessaries at cost price, constructed
houses for the married men and quarters for
the single men, and provided its employees
generally with whatever they wished for in
the way of appliances for recreation, includ-
ing books. As I had observed what the co.
had been doing for the comfort of its em-
ployees, Mr. Conacher told me what
I already knew. Then he further stated:
“The reason why these works are closing
down is that the Federal Government has
not fulfilled its obligations to the co. in the
matter of an agreement relating to shipping
facilities. The cost of labor has nothing to
do with it. This co. can pay ‘the wages.” I
sent press wires to newspapers in Sydney
and Melbourne setting out these facts. To
my _ surprise certain papers in the southern
capitals persisted in attributing the closing
of the works to the high cost of labor. I
fully expected to see a denial from the co.’s
representatives in the South, but it was
never made. Last year Sir Philip Proc-
tor, a director of the co., arrived in the
Northern Territory to confer with Mr. Con-
acher regarding the co.’s affairs and to visit
the various stations. A document was issued
over their joint names and handed to the
press; they confirmed what Mr. Conacher
had already told me. They reiterated the
statement that the cost of labor was not the
cause of the works shutting down, but added
that, in the circumstances of general depre-
ciation of values, the cost of labor might
have to be considered in the question of re-
opening. The highest rate of wages paid by
Vestey Bros, was 265. a day for unskilled
labor and up to 30s. a day in the freezer,
which was classed as skilled work. Trades-
men received the Brisbane rate, and all work-
ers received the usual tropical allowance, viz.,
p.c. A recent Bulletin statement —
“The demand for as much as 565. a day for
a youth didn’t help the industry, and, as the
same crowd is waiting to renew it if the
industry started again, the industry doesn’t
start”—is mystifying to me, and I think
I know as much of what was going on around
the meatworks as most. If any youth de-
manded 565. a day I never heard of it. A
youth doing a man’s work may have been paid
that sum for continuous labor covering day
and night for 24 hours or more, including
overtime rates, for there was a good deal of
that sort of thing done in order that con-
tracts might be fulfilled. It was war-time,
and munition-workers of both sexes were get-
ting even higher rates in Britain. Food for
the troops ranked in the same category. Con-
cerning the allusion to “the same crowd”
waiting to renew the alleged demands, the
same people are not there. Only the mar-
ried people with families remain, and a few
single men who were at the works when they
were operating. The married people threw
in their lot with the country and raised fami-
lies. Those folks were never importunate.
They only want to live in peace and sup-
port their families. They are good Austra-
lians ; but the Government evidently does
not need them, for free passages to leave
the country are being offered them, though
at a meeting in the King’s Hall a few nights
ago General Eames said the N.T. League
wanted to raise anything from £50.000,000 to
£100.000.000 to bring 100,000 people into it.
What trouble there was in Darwin was made
by foreigners, mostly Russians, who carried
block votes at union meetings, and were
always ultra. They were Russians led by
Russian Jews. They have all left.—Yours
faithfully, J. T. Beckett.

Managing Director
Bruce Assumes His Brass Hat.
When the war ended The Bulletin warned
the R. S. League against becoming associated
with any political party. Obviously, if the
League was to be of service to soldiers and
sailors laboring under war-disabilities in the
inevitable days ahead when stay-at-home
Australians had begun to forget they once
needed men to risk life and limb for them, it
would have to be purely a Fighting Men’s
party. Unfortunately, the politicians were
quick to appreciate the danger to their own
skins of a united Digger vote, and they set
about splitting the menace without d?lay.
A band of anti-Labor generals succeeded in
identifying the League more or less definitely
with Nationalism. A large percentage of
soldiers and sailors immediately repudiated
it. The generals, with yet another victory
to their credit, became active elsewhere, and
the emasculated League was left to battle
along for the men in trouble as best it could.
llow pathetically impotent it is to enforce
even the most modest and reasonable of its
planks—preference to returned men—was
indicated by the attitude taken up by Prime
Minister Bruce last week over the Ryan
matter. Ryan, of Adelaide, was appointed
to the Empire Service Exhibition Committee
the other day, “largely in consideration of h : s
war services.” The president of the S. Aus.
R. S. and S. I. League (Col. Butler, D. 5.0.)
supplied the Government with Mr. Ryan’s
war record. According to the report:—
Mr. Ryan held a commission in the C.M.F. from
1908, but made no effort to p ace his services at the
disposal of the A.I.F. until various Government de-
partments and private firms were canvassed with the
idea of inducing all eligible men to enlist. He then
presented himself at a recruiting office, was passed
as fit, but declined to sign his attestation papers....
Mr. Ryan then applied through the Minister for De-
fence for a rejection certificate. This was declined,
as he had been passed as fit.... When he attained
the age of 45 he made a further claim for a rejection
certificate, but this was again refused by the Defence
Department, as it was not necessary for a man of
that age to be supplied with the same.
Such is the “returned soldier” in whose in-
terests Prime Minister Bruce has threatened
to “break off official relations with the execu-
tive of the R. S. League.” The Bulletin’s
advice to the League is to lose no time in
accepting Mr. Bruce’s amazing challenge.
At the same time it should make it widely
known that it desires in future to have no
relations with any other political party, or
any church, sect or organisation (other than
naval or military) of any description what-
ever. The vast majority of the politicians
have never had any use for the returned men
except for what they could get out of them ;
the record of the churches and the so-called
patriotic leagues and unions is little better;
and the existing tendency to exploit the Dig-
gers on one or two anniversaries and damn
them for rebellious nuisances during the
rest of the year is bound to grow as the war
recedes further and further into the past.
An unchallengeably non-political and non-sec-
tarian league might not win the approval of
either the Labor or the anti-Labor press,
but even at this late stage it should attract
the Diggers in sufficient numbers to make
Ministers think twice before they defied its
legitimate demands. One of the elements' of
political lore which the R. S. and S. I.
League never has grasped is that a modern
political leader does nothing distasteful be-
cause the thing happens to be right and just:
the one consideration which weighs with
him is that a big block vote may be regis-
tered against his party if he leaves the thing
undone.
e
Purity and Progress.
“M.H.M.”: Purity of race, according to
“Nordic” (B. 3/5/’23), is a sine qua non of
national progress. Even mere static pros-
perity cannot be attained without it. Ex-
perts, he says somewhat cryptically, think
purity of race more important than numbers.
But how can they? Every ethnological ex-
pert knows that there is no such thing on
this planet as a pure race. More than that,
all history shows that peoples are less or
more progressive according to the measure
in which they approach or recede from the
nure-race ideal. The Esquimaux and the
Fuegians probably approach it most nearly,
and their record is not impressive. Palaeo-
lithic man inhabited Tasmania for thousands
of years without getting even as far forward
as the New Stone culture. Our own abo-
rigines had a whole continent to make experi-
ments upon and plenty of time to make them.
Where has it left them? The Red Indmn
had the ball of progress at his very feet in
a land of almost infinite and infinitely varied
natural riches; yet he kicked very few goals.
The Aztec and Inca cultures in Mexico and
Peru did get some way, it is true, but great
was the fall of them when a few hundred
Spaniards happened along and Cortes and
Pizarro got busy. The Chinese, a relatively
homogeneous people, have been .asleep for 2000
years, and. apparently, would sleep on for
another 2000 if the outer barbarian had not
got going with his bayonets and his butts.
Turn next to the northern Occident. Not
a single people there known to history is
racially pure or within a thousand miles of
purity. Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Teu-
tons, later Latins —all have been tarred or
whitewashed with a hundred different racial
brushes. The German is not of Nordic race,
as he fondly imagnes. He is a Nordo-
Alpine-Annenoid brachycephal. There is not
a pure Turk, Hungarian, Frenchman, Eng-
lishman, Irishman in all Europe. From
the Jew himself his racial traits have been
stripped until he cannot now even call his
nose his own. ("Thy nose is as the tower of
Lebanon, which looketh toward Damascus.”)
But the Beloved really deserved no cred.t
for her nose. We hear now that she got it
from the mystery-man of history, the Hittite.
Where he got it no man knowetli. The
reaction of the social phenomena (including
the Darwinian selective tendency), operative
at a particular place and peri d, first to
iribal and then to national intermixture, is
the key to human progress. It is, moreover,
a sufficient explanation of the diversities to
be found among social groups throughout
history. And if this and what has been sa.d
above will hold water, Mommsen’s dictum,
as cited by “Nordic,” becomes meaningless.
Mommsen’ in fact, must be made to bear
some share of the blame for the condition
of acute megalomania to wliicl] the German
people had been brought by tile year 1914.
He tended and watered, though he d : d not
actually sow. the seed that in the fulness
of time burgeoned into Treitzsciike’s “His-
tory” and Steward Chamberlain’s “Foun-
dations of the Nineteenth Century.” The
appalling spectacle of Germany and Europe,
as we now see it, gives the result of taking
seriously the race-gospels of learned but luna-
tic pedants.
The Dead Who Do No 111.
W. H. Edwardes, who is working in behalf
of the proposed crematorium for Sydney,
puts the case for it: —
There are two thousand acres of corruption and
germ-laden soil in London alone. Camden tells us
BRINGING THEM UP TO THE SCRATCH.
“At the Premiers’ Conference Mr. Barwell (S.A.) announced that his State would not assent to the
Federal authority building any more railways in that State-until the Commonwealth had honored its under-
taking to complete the North-South line.”
that in one year more than 60,000 of the “better
sort of people” who had died of the pestilence were
buried on the site of the Charterhouse! Surely in
these days of advanced science, and with our greater
knowledge of disease germs, the thoughtful folk.of
a young country will not be content to carry on
this custom of earth interment. What is it except
sentiment, resting ori shallow and illogical grounds,
which influences most people on this question? Senti-
ment, shallow because they do not allow themselves
to think of the bodies of the departed loved ones
as they are soon after burial; illogical because they
conjure up ideas of rest and hallowed spots, although
even in Sydney the same remains have already been
exhumed and removed twice, and hundreds of burial-
grounds are in a disgraceful state of neglect. From
raan.v more of them, no doubt, what remains of the
bodies buried in them will be removed in the course
of a few years.
The alternative to this insanitary earth burial is
to go back to what was once the almost universal
custom of cremation. “Earth to earth, ashes to
ashes, dust to dust,” argues the churchman ; but what
do those three phrases mean more or less than “ele-
ments to elements” ? By cremation the corruptible
body is reduced in one hour to the same elements
that earth interment takes years to accomplish; and
anyone who fairly studies the question must surely
feel that the small heap of pure, innocuous ash is
much nicer to contemplate than the revolting result
of earth burial. Many say they do not care what
happens to their body after death. But why not at
least take precaution against injuring some, includ-
ing one’s own loved ones, still living ? Air pollution
and water contamination are real dangers.
Cremation does not deprive us of a single act of
respect which we like to pay to those passed into the
Great Beyond. The service is practically the same, but
with greater reverence than is often shown by those
who are hired to do the work in earth-burials. The
risk to health involved in standing over the grave in
rain, wind or heat is avoided. There is no. tempta-
tion to incur expense in costly coffin or ostentatious
monument, yet it in no way prevents the provision of
a memorial.
The Early Christian objection to cremation was
founded on mistaken views concerning the resurrec-
tion, of the body. The body that has been committed
to the earth is no less dust after a few years than
the 'body which has been committed to the flames,
ike martyrs who w'ere burnt at the stake or devoured
by lions, as well as those people who have perished in
fires or been eaten by sharks, we cannot doubt wi.l be
treated like the rest when the time comes. So that
doct-rir.ally there can be no logical objection.
Cremation is a benefit to people of small means.
Often a funeral involves expense which cripples a
famjly for years. The cost of cremation is less than
that 1 of earth-burial, and, moreover, while the price of
ground increases with the increase in demand, the
cost of cremation will decrease as its use extends.
It is a reflection upon Sydney that wit!} its great
population it has hitherto had no crematorium.
Adelaide is ahead of Sydney in this respect; and
already many Sydney people have been carried to
Adelaide for cremation. This is costly, and the poor
cannot face the expense, however firmly they believe
in it. On democratic grounds this is unfair. For
years the Government has declined to build a crema-
torium, though it has made available a site; and it
has been left to enthusiastic believers in the reform
to take steps to supply the want. A company is
being formed to raise the necessary funds for build-
ing ; plans are prepared, and, as a large proportion
of the shares have been taken, a start will soon be
made. The directors include several of the best-
known doctors of Sydney.
Those who sympathise with this hygienic reform
can get full information about the Cremation Society
and the company from the secretary at 3 Spring-
street, Sydney.
Nurse Mitchell was duly acquitted in Mel-
bourne last Thursday on charges of intent
to murder-and intent to do grievous bodily
harm to Frank Bonfiglio. If a woman
practised as an abortionist, and if she had
a mishap and wanted to dispose of the body,
she could not select a safer instru-
ment than Bonfiglio. And if eventually
she decided to put a bullet into someone,
Bonfiglio would be immediately indi-
cated as the soundest mark, provided he
was not injured sufficiently to debar him
from giving evidence against her. For Bon-
figlio is a criminal of such an unspeakably
debased order that no jury in the world
could hang the humblest of mongrel dogs
on his evidence. The whole case for the
Crown rested on Bonfiglio last week, as it
had done in the Bertha Cougiilan matter.
Inevitably, Nurse Mitchell, her blue limou-
sine, and her Paris frocks are irradiating
the streets of the southern capital again.
But what of Bonfiglio? At the best this
smirking little Judas is a proved black
mailer and a confessed handv-man in the
disposal of bodies that it is well to get rid of.
The Crown is competent to deport certain
advocates of disorder whose private lives are
above reproach. It periodically “vags”
batches of citizens on suspicion of a dis-
position towards disorderliness, regardless
of whether the arrested are genuine vagrants
or not. But a Bonfiglio remains the Law’s
good friend. A community which is impo-
tent in face of such a situation almost pro-
vides an argument for the Ku Klux Klanism
with which parts of the U.S.A. are shocking
those who entertain British notions of justice.
“Macquabie Stbeet” on a new hope:—
Surprise is being expressed because insu.in, the new
remedy for diabetes, cannct be procured in Australia.
The fact is that much remains to be done in the
matter of preparation before this remedy can be put
upon the market with any degree of satisfaction or
safety, therapeutically. Inquiries at the wholesale
druggists are frequent—and fruitless. It is being
prepared in small quantities in Toronto, and in a few
laboratories in U.S.A., but only special cases, in
special clinics, are being treated. In England the
control of it has been handed over to the Medical Re-
search Council, which is taking good care that it is
not exploited. The Council is safeguarding the pub-
lic and using the remedy at special institutions where
results can be checked in physiological and biochemi-
cal laboratories. As yet it is only given hypodermi-
cally, which has its drawbacks. Tuberculin was
always given this way until a.professor at Edinburgh
hit upon the plan of making it into an ointment, and
rubbing it into the skin with a glass rod. One may
be certain that when permission is given by the Re-
search Council to manufacturers to prepare insulin
on a large scale, Australia will be to the fore. Here
are animals in plenty, from the pancreas of which
it is extracted. The Commonwealth may some day
supply the world in great part, just as it is doing in
the matter of thyroid gland substance, tabloids of
which, prepared at Waterloo, Sydney, go thence
to the extremities of the earth. Insulin lowers the
percentage of sugar in the blood, and consequently
the amount excreted. It will thus prevent the appal-
ling condition into which sufferers from this awful
disease are reduced, and will prolong life, though a
complete cure is doubtful. But it looks as if some
other method than hypodermic medication will have
to be devised.
• ;
“Rio”: Sydney Evening News, superficial
as usual, argues that the North-to-South rail-
way would have no defence value, and scoffs
at the idea of a sane enemy landing at Dar-
win. Now, the ohly possible invader of Aus-
tralia for many years is an Asiatic naval
Power in quest <}f territory. That being so,
and having command of the sea, all the enemy
has to do is to land a very small force of
fighting troops (enough to deal with the thou-
sand untrained whites in the Territory), and
follow up with an army of agricultural and
industrial civilians. These could disembark
at some place not necessarily Darwin. Then
in a few months the invader could be grow-
ing enough rice, etc., to be self-supporting,
and could bring over women and children to
permanently colonise the place, and all the
time he would be within a few days’ steam of
his home base, where all the requirements of
a modern army are manufactured. Australia
could do nothing until she either built the
railway or regained command of the sea,
and even then she would be dependent on
England for most of her munitions, and by
this time the enerny, having had months to
establish himself, fortify harbors, create air-
craft deoots and i adopt other defensive mea-
sures, would take a lot of digging out; while
the fact that he had actually settled .the coun-
try claimed, and which was previously unin-
habited, would give him a great moral advan-
tage at the Peace Conference. Why a sane
commander should waste time, men and
money, and enormously lengthen his lines of
communication, in order to fight the large
forces based on Sydney and Melbourne on
their own ground, when he can sit tight in
the sought territory and make the Common-
wealth army come thousands of miles across
what the Evening News calls a “desert” to
attack him, only the News can explain.
When Ireland simmers down sufficiently to
take the census which was omitted in 1921
it will mqke a guess for the first time at the
physical damage done by the civil war. The
financial damage in the Free State since the
Irishman was left to scrap with his fellow
Mike is set down by President Cosgrove at
£40,000,000, and certainly the sacking of
Cork must have been a big item in itself.
The sacking of towns was supposed to be an
out-of-date and untidy savagery, the levying
of “contributions” having taken its place.
Thus 'the invader’s treasury got the profit
instead of the common soldier: Private
Smith didn’t become drunk, liable to sur-
prise, and temporarily useless; and the
town, which the invader might want later,
didn’t get burned down by chance, with the
loss of Private Smith, who would also be
wanted later, overtaken by beer and flames
in some cellar. But the Irish republican
army was very casual, and went back to the
old ways, and in its looting it probably got
2d. out of every shilling and trod lOd. under
foot in its excitement. Now tnat census
figures are struggling to light the conclu-
sion is that organised war, even with
all the Hun horrors thrown in, doesn’t get
so far ahead of the birthrate as to reduce
population very fast or very materially.
But perdition awakes with the lid off when
it is a case of untidy, tousled mob-war for
a principle, with every sublime patriot free
to take a hand and go for the rival sublime
patriot, also for his wife and his house
and his crops and his belongings generally

POLITICAL
POINTS
“Gallery” : Prime Minister Bruce’s friends
will have to take him aside and beg him to
watch his head. His breach with the Re-
turned Soldiers over the Ryan appointment
is an example of aggravated egotism, pos-
sibly fraught with political consequences to
himself and his party. With all his faults,
Hughes would never have been guilty of an-
noyiiug a powerful political influence that has
its representatives in the National crowd.
But, Bruce has no compunction in the matter,
and after watching him closely at the Pre-
miers’ Conference one felt that his diplomatic
aptitude has been affected by a growing
absorption in his own magnificence. In this
Conference Bruce, a mere babe in political
experience, like his colleagues Page and
Stewart, was pitted against political vet-
erans, but he gave no suggestion of meeting
them on terms of equality, and, in fact, his
tone in argument was calculated to nettle
the oldsters, even with all its affected air of
Chesterfieldian amiability. His method of
starting business by sharply tapping the table
with a pencil might have been diverting in
another atmosphere, but it had a pedagogic
peremptoriness about it that could hardly
have added to the happiness of the meeting.
From an old Parliamentary hand: —
The calibre of the Premiers’ Copference, which
mustered last week in the Reps.’ Chamber in Mel-
bourne, doesn’t seem to compare well with that of
the Federal Convention which held its third session
in the same place 25 years ago. I am sure the
same thought flashed across the mind of Alec Peacock,
who sat in his old place on the Treasury bench—
the one he occupied as Chief Sec. in the first and
second Turner Governments. Bruce and Page are
still amateurish. McPherson, though well-equipped
mentally, felt the surroundings unfamiliar, and was
reserved and shy. Theodore’s personality impressed
itself, and he showed form suggestive of the first
line in the 1897-98 Convention. Mitchell, wearing
his overcoat to keep out the cold, was a long way
behind Forrest; and Barwell, clever as he looks, did
not show himself the equal of the chiefs of the
notable contingent sent by S.A. to frame the Con-
stitution. Arthur Robinson’s attitude was too Upper-
Chambahish, and Bavin did not break the ice.
Oakes was obviously not at home, and did not con-
vince anybody that he ought to be anything higher
than a Deputy-Premier.
A familiar sort of item: —
James Mitchell, Premier of Westralia, passed
through Adelaide... .He said he thought South Aus-
tralia was hardly adopting the right attitude in re-
quiring the South-to-North railway issue to be settled
before discussing the Port Augusta-Hay proposal.
He wanted to see the capitals linked up by a uniform
gauge for developmental and defence purposes. ...
One reason why the capitals are not “linked
up by a uniform -gauge” is that W.A. persis-
tently breaks its promise, on the strength of
which it got its Federal railway, to standard-
ise the Kalgoorlie-Perth section. The West-
ralian man now wants another Federal rail-
way built according to his plans, and thinks
it should have precedence over the one S.A.
paid for 12 years ago. A short-tempered
man in Harwell's place might have replied by
a promise to close the S.A. State lines against
the Perth train, and leave Mitchell minus the
railway he has got already. And he might
keep his promise.
Australia was due for a celebration some
time this last half-year, though no one can fix
the exact day. The Commonwealth measures
1.903,731,840 acres, so when it owed
£951.865,920 of Federal and State debt it
owed 10s. per acre. It was well over the
922-millions mark last June, and now it has
assuredly arrived—but when, exactly? The
Bulletin would hate to have to leave the
performance out of its monthly birthday-list
on the ground of uncertainty.
One of the reasons, if not the main one,
why Lord Curzon missed the Prime Minister-
ship was that, as a member of the House of
Lords, he w T ould have had to lead the Gov-
ernment in a Chamber where the Labor
party, which is the official Opposition, has
no representative. “It is believed that, in
the event of a peer being chosen Prime Min-
ister, Labor would use every political device
to precipitate a dissolution.” This attitude
is intelligible enough; but what would Brit-
ish Labor do if a general election gave it a
majority and it had to form a Government?
Representation of some kind in the second
Chamber would be essential —it would be
impossible, for instance, to appoint a Lord
Chancellor from the Opposition—but nobody
has yet indicated how it is to be secured.
The situation opens up some queer possibili-
ties.
Naturally Russia is taking advantage of
the turmoil in Northern Germany to push
Bolshevik propaganda there, and Communist
demonstrations are becoming too frequent
to be good for the world’s peace. If France
does not show a better disposition to join
with the other Powers in finalising the
Reparations question and ending this danger,
a large body of the world’s opinion will swing
against her. And in Britain, at any rate,
the change-over will come easily. Poincare’s
sympathy with the great French coal, inter-
ests in the north-east is well' known ; and
there has always been an uneasy feeling in
England that if the Ruhr was not rich in
the raw materials necessary to extend the
French iron and steel industry it would
never have been seized. If France does not
PARADISE LOST.
“The Government has advised all Asiatics and others receiving Government rations that work would
be provided at 4s. 6d. a day, or farm work at at. a week and found. The issue of free rations has
been stopped.” —Cable from Darwin.
grasp every opportunity that offers to bring
about a complete settlement of the Repara-
tions question, the suspicion will inevitably
gain ground that she doesn’t want a settle-
ment in which her recent allies will share —•
that she only wants the Ruhr for herself.
Now that the parties involved in the
N.S.W. coal conflict have dug themselves in
it is pleasing to know that there is nothing
brain-racking about the issue. There is
only one, it having been agreed that arbitra-
tion is possible about all the rest. The
owners want to get rid of about 80 men who
are known as the organisers of practically
all the “irritation” stoppages, which have
lately run to more than one per day. These
men are mostly imported, and to a marked
extent not of our own race. They assert
the right to hold jabs and collect pay prac-
tically for life, no matter how offensive they
may be, and thus keep real Australians and
good unionists out of jobs. Sacking, say,
an employee of a Labor paper is just sack
in the same way as “a primrose by the river’s
brim” is just a primrose, and not a ghost
or a lobster. He has no redress unless he
is sacked in contravention of an agree-
ment. But if he has no agreement
and possesses no special merits save the
merit of doing everything possible to destroy
business, then he becomes sacred. To send
him away from the work, or to refuse to
take him back to work with the rest after
the stoppage which he has engineered, is
“victimisation” ; and some enthusiasts
(mostly imported) would burn Sydney to
the ground rather than permit one disrupter
to be “victimised.” A Government with a
millionth part the energy of the apparatus
at Moscow would oil the deportation
machine, and then look up the records of the
most notorious peace-destroyers to see how
many are eligible for a pleasant trip.
Party politics are getting better and better
entrenched. First, the Opposition leaders
were presented with regular salaries to make
it harder for the Government to pass legisla-
tion. Now they have secretaries, also paid,
to help them do it more effectively. On page
20 of the 1922-23 estimate for the P.M.’s
Department is this: “Salary and travelling
allowance of officers acting as secretaries to
leaders of Opposition in Senate and House of
Representatives and leader of Country party,
£1500.” As election travelling expenses are
also found, the vote looks as though it will
be considerably exceeded.
Despite all rumors, Theodore’s statement
that he isn’t going to leave Queensland State
politics for the Federal arena—till 1920,
anyhow—was a matter of course. No door
leading to the Federal arena is open just
now, or likely to open. The Federal elec-
tion isn’t due till 1926. And retirements
to make room for party potentates are not
as popular as they were. Con Wallace gave
up his sure seat at West Sydney in order
to make Ryan a Federal member and Theo-
dore a full-blown Premier. It was assumed
that Con was to be “provided for” in some
way, and he was. After some delay he was
furnished with an exasperating job at Bris-
bane at about £4 a week. He came back
to Sydney practically starved out, and when
Ryan died he applied for a nomination for
his old constituency. But the pushful Lam-
bert wanted it then, so Con proceeded to die
in poverty and disappointment.
Though the veil of mystery isn’t wholly
rent the verdict is foreshadowed that about
40 of the Commonwealth’s mercantile arks
can’t earn their keep, and should be sold iu
a market where arks are a drug, and likely
to be drugger. That will leave Australia
with five passenger craft and two unfinished
cargo boats. A sketchy lieet Ike that isn’t
big enough to assert the principle of public
ownership, or to affect rates, or to do any-
thing save give union bosses a chance to
amuse themselves. It is best, to sell it, and
pay the losses out of revenue, even if the
proposed raising of the Federal income-tax
exemption has to be abandoned for a few
years. Apropos , it is pleasing to reflect that
Canberra could be Scrapped for a eompara
tive trifle —less than half the money lost on
Hughes’s ships—if this is our day for selling
derelicts and trading off arks.
“Brown of Barcaldine” made the neatest
score of the Queensland elections; and it
was at The Bulletin’s expense. This paper
said in an expansive moment that, consider-
ing all things, if Theodore won it would be
the age of miracles back again. Three days
after the elections Brown of Barcaldine
dropped in his little wire: “The age of
miracles has returned.” Which was game
and set to Brown.
Maoriland has a short way with folk who
come here to save us when we don’t want to be
saved on their lines, and with people who pro-
fess to be collecting for other people’s insur-
rections. Its authorities simply announced
that O’Kelly and Flanagan would not be
allowed to land. No particular explanation
was given—only that the lady was mistress
in her own house, and claimed the right to
choose her own company.
“Stellsby” : D.vett, of the R.5.5.1.L.A., is
off on another jaunt—to London—and on
this occasion the Commonwealth Govern-
ment is donating £6OO towards his expenses
and those of his two companions. Why?
Apart from the fact that a big percentage
of returned men, for reasons too multitudi-
nous to enumerate, don’t belong to the
League, what earthly good comes out of these
jaunts? It seems most absurd that, in our
present circumstances, a man —worse still,
three men —should be encouraged to travel
12,000 miles in order to shake hands with
• Harl-Haig, -Edward -Pi,-and tm-Fwofl-the-wai-
Doughboy. Apparently little else is ever
accomplished.
The A.L.P. warfare is going on just as
strongly as ever; but instead of the leaders
slang-whanging one another in the press, the
battle is being pursued in the branch
leagues, which have still to elect delegates to
the annual conference. Those which have
already elected delegates are, as a rule, stick-
ing to their choice; but the A.L.P. executive
sends reps, to most of the others to influence
their decision. At the R.vde League Council
the other night the executive suffered defeat
all along the line. But though this is first
blood to its enemies the executive is promis-
ing to make trouble over the credentials of
delegates; and everything points to the con-
ference being a very lively cat-fight.
Announced that N.S.W. ex-Premier Dooley,
having heard that someone is likely to write
pamphlets about him, has been to the Crimi-
nal Investigation Department to demand
strenuous measures. What the exact penalty
may be under the Anti-Dooley Pamphlet
Prevention Act The Bulletin disremem-
bers at the moment, but it is pretty bad.
The “work from within” advice of the
Russian Soviet leaders is evidently being put
into operation. The other day Donald Grant,
ex-I.W.W. leader and “Red” Domain orator,
was admitted, without a murmur from the
A.L.P. executive, as a member of the Pad-
dington League. Grant, at last election, ran
as an opponent of the official Laborite at
Broken Hill —supposedly an offence that can
only be obliterated by three years’ penance.
But if the candidate for re-admission is suffi-
ciently Red, nothing else seems to matter.
Vic. Milk Act was passed nearly six months
ago, but it will not come into force till to-
morrow (June 1). A Board, which will be
little more than advisory, will be appointed
on July 1, but it can do little unless metro-
politan municipal councils, which are notori-
ously _ conservative, can be galvanised into
establishing depdts for the purchase, treat-
ment and sale of milk. There is nothing in
the new law to force them to provide for a
pure supply. They “may,” if they think fit,
combine and set up the depots. But it
doesn’t look as if many of them will unless
some Ministry induces Parliament to use a
spur.
LOYALTY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is no word more used than loyalty;
There is no rarer thing on earth to-day
Than loyalty that keeps the faith alwav
Towards the weak, to all that makes us free,
Upheld by hopes of brighter years to be;
That ever sees the gold behind the grey.
I think the gods themselves are sad to see
The loud-voiced and the selfish rise and sway
The heedless crowds with that most sacred name.
No loyalist is he who only brings
A slavish service to the feet of kings,
But he who some cherished dream attain
In Freedom’s cause, and hold it truest gain,
Past praise of kings or any earthly fame.

During the past two years paid capital has
been increased from two millions to
£2,725,(XX), and £177,903 share premiums
have gone into reserves. The National is
growing so rapidly, though, that a call has
gone out for further funds. There are at
present two classes of shares: £lO fully-paid
prefs. and £8 ordinaries paid to £5. Under
the National-Colonial amalgamation the pre-
ference rights attaching to the former scrip
lapsed when six consecutive half-yearly divs.
at the rate of 8 p.c. had been paid. Capital
account has so far not been consolidated,
and the Articles have not been amended to
delete the references to pref. scrip. Share-
holders are now asked to agree to convert the
88,000 unissued £lO prefs. into £lO ordinaries.
It is proposed to offer 41,750 of these at a
premium of £3 per share, producing £417,500
new capital and £125,250 of premiums. A
div. rate of 10 p.c. will give subscribers
almost 7.7 p.c. In addition, the directors
are offering 16,500 £8 ordinaries, to be paid
to £5 each, and are inviting shareholders
to tender for the scrip in parcels of up to
2000 shares. It will be interesting to com-
pare the premiums voluhtarily paid on these
shares with those asked on the other issue.
Both lists close on June 30.
The reasons for the introduction of new

With the assistance of the three millions-
odd which went into the National as a result
of the absorption of the Bank of Queensland,
in five years total liabilities to the public
have expanded from £20,327,187 to
£30,617,774. In the past 12 months deposits
grew almost £1,702,000. The management
has found employment for every penny it
lias had available. At March 31 £9,700,000
more was loaned out than five years previ-
ously, and £4,940,000 more than two years ago,
when the banks were helping traders to carry
the abnormally heavy and costly stocks un-
loaded on the Australian market. , The rapid
growth of the National is illustrated better
by going back to the 1914 accounts of the two
old banks : deposits then totalled £15,308,956 ;
advances £12,151,862.
One effect of the National’s popularity in
recent years has been that, notwithstanding
all its new funds from share issues, premiums
thereon and the large surpluses of profit over
and above divs., the ratio of funds to liabili-
ties has declined slightly. At the first balance
after the amalgamation (1918), it held
£6 14s. 3d. of the public’s money for every £1
of its own ; and a,t March 31 last £6 15s. 2d.
A thoroughly sound position, of course. The
management could, with present funds, accept
51 millions more of the public’s cash and
not exceed what is regarded as a safe work-
ing basis for Australian banks. With the
additional funds now being raised, slightly
under £6 of outside money will be held for
every £.l of capital and reserves.
The strain lately has been in respect of de-
mands for accommodation: at the. latest
balance 36.3 p.c. of liabilities was in liquid
form, compared with 44.5 p.c. 12 months
back. At March 31 £19,477,370 of the pub-
lic’s £30,617,774 was out in advances. A
feature of the latest balance-sheet, however,
was the larger volume of fixed deposits; of
the 14b millions at current account, owing
on bills, notes, etc., and accrued interest,
£11,140,000 was in cash, Commonwealth
notes, public securities and other liquid
assets. The backing for the £19,477,370 lia-
bility to the public not covered by liquid
assets was the £23,292,462 of advances, and
premises, etc., written down to £852,452:
assets with a book value of £124 for every
£lOO in its care. The new funds now being
raised will, of course, further strengthen the
position. As to the quality of the National’s
investments, the thorough overhaul within
recent years of the securities of all four banks
in the present National—it includes the old
Colonial, North Queensland and Royal of
Queensland—should guarantee that there are
no legacies of ancient troubles on hand. And
whatever losses have been incurred in recent
years have, no doubt, been provided for out
of the exceptional earnings from abnormal
conditions.
The National is nowadays the third bank
of the Commonwealth in respect of deposits
—only the Wales and Commercial of Syd-
ney are ahead of it. Having almost two
millions of reserves to help £3,225,000 of
capital—taking credit for the new issues
and their premiums—the bank looks well
equipped to make profits which should give
good divs. The past year’s net earnings
were £120,000 larger than a 10 p.c. div. on
the enlarged capital will require.

Twelve months ago the affairs of this little
co. looked rather hopeless. Paid capital was
£24,500 —the remnants of a previous clean-
up in which £10,500 had been swept away
—and trading results had been so unsatis-
factory that the accounts showed an accumu-
lated loss of £10,711. Less than three years
previously, after a run of 10 p.c. divs. on the
reduced capital, reserves of £3788 were
claimed. A new crowd got control last year
and set about straightening things. They
induced creditors to accept two- to five-year
debentures, and eased the pressure slightly
by getting in £4365 of 10 p.c. pref. capital.
recovery appears to have been
effected by re-organisation of manufacturing
and trading; for the past 12 months £6726
net profit was claimed. These earnings, the
new pref. capital (£6465 at the latest bal-
ance) and £3500 from the sale of property
reduced liabilities from £37,380 to £16,637 in
12 months. The recovery is shown in the
following comparisons of the liquid position:
Mar., Mar., Sept., Mar.,
1918. 1922. 1922. 1923.
Liquid assets . . £11,159 £14,825 £10,032 £13,109
Liabilities . . 12,330 37,380 21,428 16,637
Excess liabilities.. . £1,171 £22,555 £11,396 £3,528
The debit at Profit and Loss is now £4395,
and the whole of that should disappear dur-
ing the current year if recent profit-earning
is maintained. But the outlook for share-
holders won’t brighten until the management
can shake off its funded creditors— : at
March 31 there were still debentures for
£8365 to be met. The prospects of ordinary
shareholders have, of course, been altered by
the £6465 of 10 p.c. prefs., who have first
call on profits. But if earnings are main-
tained at recent level, there should be more
than a few crumbs for them.

Including the periodic special bonus, divs.
for the past four years have averaged 13
p.c. p.a. That is a high rate for a building
society which gets no more than 7 p.c. for
most of its money. For a lot of its funds
it depends on depositors, and interest received
on that money gives only a small margin
over interest paid. At March 31 the Equit-
able had the use of £205,092 of deposits;
paid capital is £93,900. But the old society
- —this is its jubilee year—-has accumulated
almost £lOO,OOO of visible reserves. Capital
and reserves combined have to show only 6J
p.c. to give 13 p.c. on capital, and that is
accomplished easily with the assistance of
outside funds. The management has had
no difficulty in finding employment for all
the money it could Hicksonise: the demands
on building societies have been heavy since
the war diverted mortgagees’ money into
public securities and other channels, and
since home-building boomed. On the other
hand, the societies have not had the
command of so much deposits as formerly;
this one had £24,000 more in 1913. Never-
theless, £12,763 of new capital and accumu-
lated profits have permitted an increase of
mortgages from £324,835 to £370,829 in the
10 years. How rapidly cash flows in and out
is shown by the following table of new
advances, which in 10 years have totalled
£841,822: —
1913 .. £116,687 | 1919 .. £97,918
1915 .. 82,093 I 1920 .. 120,072
1916 .. 71,907 1921 .. 109,389
1917 . . 85,482 | 1922 . . 102,893
1918 .. 75,797 | 1923 .. 96,331
The figures have been inflated by abnormal
conditions: the big increase of suburban pro-
perty values induced many borrowers to
sell and snatch profits; but the building
societies have had no difficulty in finding
other borrowers. Managements' have, there-
fore, been in the happy position of being
able to pick and choose their securities and
clients.
Besides the advances, at March 31 the
Equitable showed the following assets: pre-
mises, £18,604 (which seems little for the
four-storey, corner city-freehold) ; E., S. and
A. stock, £6255; public securities, £3000;
and cash £7955. Liabilities other than de-
posits, but including interest accrued there-
on, amounted to £7700. The surplus of
liquid assets over current liabilities was
£lO,llO. That left £194,952 of deposits to
be covered by £370,829 of advances, and the
city freehold. Every £1 of borrowed funds
not held liquid was, therefore, covered by
other assets with a book value of £2.

Latest profits were the Co-operative’s best in
26 years. Gross earnings jumped from
£68,755 for the 12 months ended March,
1922, to £94,944 for last year; exes, were
only £8638 larger. A revived wool market
was partly responsible for the better results :
the period opened with 15,664 bales in store
unsold; 75,862 bales from the current clip
were given into the co.’s care, and all but
4490 of the total had been placed when the
accounts closed. All-round expansion in
other departments also helped. The live-
stock connection secured by the purchase of
Maiden Bros.’ business a few years ago con-
tinues to develop, and 491,242 sheep were
sold by the co. The turnover of cattle
(21,564), pigs (9137) and store cattle also
increased considerably. The co.’s hand-
lings of hides, skins and other station pro-
duce are likewise growing, and bigger business
is being done in station supplies and insur-
ances. Capital was increased from £72,205
to £83,284 during the year, but the funds
all went into concrete : new stores have beep
put up at Pyrmont, but they were completed
too late in the financial year to help earn-
ings.
The book value of property, stores and
plant jumped from £78,523 to £194,232 dur-
ing the year, and these assets alone exceed
total capital and reserves by £77,654. Con-
sequently the co. is depending on outsiders
to finance its agency transactions and other
operations:—

At March 31 —prior to distributing £6331 of
divs.—liabilities exceeded all liquid assets
by nearly £60,000. That looks as though the
cash position was not comfortable, but every-
thing depends on the nature of the co.’s lia-
bilities. No doubt a large slice of them con-
sists of mortgages on properties.
A feature of the Co-operative is the bonus
distribution: last year selling customers re-
ceived almost two-nfths of net profits in
cash rebates—3o p.c. of wool commissions
and 15 p.c. of all commissions from market-
ing live-stock and station produce; That
left £15,464 for shareholders. The 8 p.c. on
cum. prefs. (£36,941) took £2624. The bal-
ance (£12,840) represented more than 27 p.c.
on ordinary capital (£46,343). The directors
voted £3047 to an employees’ provident fund,
and when 8 p.c. had been Daid on ordinaries
£6086 was left over .for reserves. The div.
rate is slightly better than 8 p.c. to old pro-
prietors: when they subscribed the £1 prefs.
a couple of years ago £9210 of reserves were
taken to pay up ss. per share.

The public is not deeply interested in this old
co.: all its capital was subscribed privately,
and transfers have not been extensive since
scrip was listed on ’Change about 18 months
ago. There have been a few sales in recent
months —at prices down to 17s. 4d. per £1
fully-paid ; evidently a few of the timid have
become alarmed at the gyrations of N.S.W.
Justice Minister Ley, who, though he is un-
dertaking a very desirable cleaning-up of the
low-class wine-saloons, draws his inspiration
from a water-bottle. Though new legislation
has affected turnover —the “open” saloon has
resulted in the falling-off of the bottle trade
—last year’s smaller profits were mostly-
accounted for by declining values. Grape-
juice has become cheaper; though, since
Caldwell’s itself controls numerous saloons, it
should not have suffered as others have. A
little of the glitter of the wine trade has also
disappeared in recent years owing to the
incursions of the brewers into the
wine and spirit business: they insist
on controlling supplies for their tied-houses
—-of course, for a consideration. Caldwell’s
gross profits have fallen from £42,265 in
1920 to £40,652 in 1921, and to £34,644 last
year. Expenses have been got down a trifle,
but not sufficiently to save a big fall in net
earnings. Twelve months ago the published
balance-sheets showed a profit of £12,615,
but in the table £2OOl taxes since paid in
respect of that accounting period have been
deducted. The past year’s £6941 is subject
to similar deductions. When taxes have been
met, the accounts will probably show that
even the reduced div. of 8 p.c. (a fall from
15 p.c. paid for the previous two years) has
not been fully earned.
Goodwill figures in the accounts at £25,000,
but reserves and the P. and L. carry-forward
cover all except an odd £3 of that intangible
asset. The precise nature of the reserves is
not disclosed, though since plant, tools, fur-
niture, etc., valued at £21,655, are given a
book value of £16,495, the accumulation is
not required to provide for depreciation of
those assets. The book value of stocks is
only £15,000 than paid capital, and as
£45,773 is in vineyards, cellars, plant, etc.,
the co. is leaning heavily on outsiders. At
Dec., 1921, liabilities amounted to £62,385,
at the latest balance they had been reduced
to £53,306. However, there were stocks, bock
debts and cash £41,163 in excess of all credi-
tors at December 31 last. Balance-sheet
figures for the past three years have been
as follows:
1920. 1921. 1922.
Paid capital. . . . ... £66,400 £BO,OOO £80,500

Stock 77,599 79,046 65,469
Cash, etc. .. . . .. 253 376 551
The co.’s present position and its profit-
earning prospects depend largely on the basis
on which stocks were valued at March 31.
Much also depends on how recent legislation
affects book values of wine-saloon interests.
The £80,500 of capital includes £19,480 of
8 p.c. prefs.

Sbortland Islands Plantations, Ltd.
—This Burns-Philp offshoot, with a paid
capital of £47,735, owns two areas, totalling
19,293 acres in the British Solomons, but

The copra output is growing as plantings
mature: 1920, 148$ tons; 1921, 189; 1922,
252: 1923, 304. But owing to low prices the
co. has not benefited much. Last year
£2126 was credited from proceeds of produce.
Since the balancing-date (Jan. 31) the copra
market has improved, and if the higher prices
are maintained on the larger output expected
this year the co. should make a better show-
ing in its next accounts. So far £13,931
has been received from sales of produce, and
on the other side there is a sort of estab-

Corners are being swept by B. H. Block
10. The Misima gold venture has crashed,
so the book value of “shares in other cos.”
has been carved from £96,996 to £5OO. This
has been accomplished by mopping up the
reserve of £39,000, the P. and L. credit of
£29,757, wiping £11,728 off the dump sus-
pense account and writing in a P. and L.
debit balance of £20,635. These cross-entries
give a book loss for the six months of
£50,392. There remains as an asset the
Misima loan of £25,000, and it was to meet
that debt that the Papuan assets were
ordered under the hammer. Incidentally, the
auctioneer failed to get a bid. On top of
£132,000 of g’pld won, £170,000 more was
Wrhhg otit of Misima shareholders, including
Block 10. Yet chairman Alex. Campbell
declares that, although the venture has ended
in disaster, the property still holds out great
inducements for development “by strong capi-
talists.” This is because it has a shoot of
ore 2000 ft. long and 101,000 tons in sight
worth 325. 6d., which won’t pay under pre-
sent conditions. What value is the biggest
auriferous ore body in the universe if it can’t
supply pay-ore? Six months ago B. 11.
Block 10 decided to pay no more calls into
Misima; any calls were to be devoted to
helping the Broken Hill show. But instead
of calls being- made to get to work the direc-
tors have mortgaged the whole outfit to
Associated Smelters. If lead had kept at
£29 and zinc at £35 the wailing of six months
ago over the Edmunds awdrd might have
been forgotten, but with lead back at about
£25 there is a possibility that “expenses will
largely exceed income, and operations will
once more be brought to a close.”
B. H. Block 14 ambles along with Block
10. It, too, is now pledged to Port Pirie.
The co. showed a loss of £5769 for the six
months ended March 31. Debts totted up
£l2OO, and on the other side were stores,
£6850; sundry debtors, ±4880; cash, £lll2.

The prospectus of the New Kangiara,
issued in Melbourne, is a remarkable
document. The proposed co. is to take
over less than eight months’ working option
over the old Kangiara mine, near Yass
(N.S.W.), the consideration, on the exercise
of the option, being £10,500 cash and 25,000
fully-paid shares (out of 100,000 shares of
10s. each), and £lO,OOO cash and 10,000
shares are to go to the lessee, who, more-
over, during- the currency of the option, is
to draw £lOO per month. Lucky lessee ! The
prospectus builds beautiful castles in Spain
on the unsubstantial foundations of “it is
said” and “it should be so.” For instance :
Should this new chute develop in the same man-
ner and be of the same value as the original chute
worked by the old Kangiara co., which is said to have
produced ore to the value of over £1,000,000, and
distributed large sums in divs., substantial profits
should be available for distribution.
The million of metal and “large sums in
divs.” is news to the “Wild Cat.” Official
records do not credit Kangiara with any div.,
and outputs, according to old hands on the
field, could be expressed in six figures—and
not high up in that scale, either.

J. Whear Roberts on tin-sluicing practice:
Tingha Tin’s annual report states that sluicing
operations had been restricted owing to the low
price of tin, and that the work done showed a loss
of £5732. Mine expenses were £9040 and admin-
istration charges £2lBl, against Which tin proceeds
were £6389. Manager Frank Wilson, formerly of
Y-Water, is emphatic on one point: “It has been
quite apparent from the outset that portable plants
are highly inefficient and expensive to work, and
that some more economic method must be adopted
to work all but the richest of the holdings.” On
his recommendation a Thompson suction-cutter dredg-
ing plant is to be installed, and special calls are
being made to pay for it. It is estimated that this
plant will have a capacity of 20,000 yd. per month,
and that working costs will not exceed 6d. per yd.,
as against Is. 3d. with the best of the co.’s three
portable pumping plants. Years ago I condemned
the New England sluicing practice with portable
plants as being “wicked,'wilful waste.” Costly prac j
tical experience has more than confirmed that im-
pression, and I now say that continuance of the
practice is nothing short of a tragedy. It is pleasing
to be backed up in this by Tingha’s manager. These
facts and conclusions may well be pondered over by
many of the operating cos. in New England. It is
not suggested that a suction-cutter dredging plant
is a cure-all —it has its distinct limitations, regulated
by physical conditions —but it is asserted that the
pumping plants may be materially altered to promote
efficiency and economy.
Westfalia lias lately been floating a few
gold-mines on its own account. One, Bur-
banks Oversight, annears to have something
promising, and while prospects look good the
co. has passed on to shareholders a few
thousand ss. reserve shares at Is. per share
premium. If the mine continues to improve the
Board proposes to recommend one of three
proposals: (1) Floating a larger and more
strongly-financed co.; (2) selling out to an-
other co. for cash and shares; (3) carrying
on and trusting to fortune, which on the
Burbanks field has been very fickle. Another
recent local flotation is the Oroya East, at
Sandstone. The co. reckoned on 2oz. ore,
and the first crushing did not fall far short
of that. But the field is notorious for im-
poverishment at shallow depths.

Bullfinch Proprietary (W.A.) shut down
18 months ago and announced that it would
remain idle until wages, cost of stores, etc.,
came down. It has now relented, and as a
preliminary has thrown the oxid.sed work-
ings open to tributors. As the cost of run-
ning the Bullfinch plant on small parcels
would be prohibitive, it is presumed that the
tributors will have to get their ore milled
elsewhere. Meanwhile efforts are being made
by interested parties to encourage market
gambling. At present there is not enough
payable ore in sight to give the shares more
than a speculative value.
Westralian mining men are wondering why
a State prospecting party is being sent to the
Coobina auriferous belt, in the lower nor’-
west. The Department’s official reports on
the locality state that any reefs likely to be
found there would be too small to pay for
the erection of machinery, and that transport
to a battery elsewhere would allow only
specimen ore to be treated.
Sons of Gwalia’s resurrection is delayed.
An air-compressor which should have been
working by now is awaiting installation, and
underground work will not be resumed next
month as anticipated. The new treatment
plant is not likely to start until July or
August.

“O.B.”: Westralian Mining Association
recently discussed the prevalence of “false
and misleading reports,” and passed a resolu-
tion urging the Government to prevent their
issue. The question arises whether it is
desirable to register mine-managers. A man-
ager who circulates false reports about a
mine may be relieved of his job, but sooner
or later he will be managing a mine else-
where. This would be impossible under a
system of registration providing for cancel-
lation of certificates, as in certain other pro-
fessions.
Paringa’s proposal to reduce its issued
share capital from 646,550 fully-paid ss.
shares to the same number of fully paid Is.
shares has been adopted by shareholders. At
the shareholders’ meeting in London, chair-
man Parker said that the co. was in a sound
financial position, and that its Kalgoorlie
and Rhodesian interests wm full of promise.
But all this has been said over and over
again, and the wonder is that shareholders
don’t beg for a new tale with a little more
money in it.

Retaliation Reward directors are optimis-
tic as to the prospects of the Southern Gar-
den Gully mine (Bendigo), which they are
working under option. Further develop-
ments in the reef at 950 ft. are considered
very satisfactory, and at a meeting last week
the chairman announced that the battery
would be at work on “payable stone” within
a week or two. It is less than two months
since the mine was taken over, and in that
time the shaft has been repaired and the
extensive plant overhauled. It is hardly
credible that an option should be available
over a splendidly equipped mine in which all
that the new men had to do was to go into
workings above water level and start
machine-drills on a 6ft. reef showing pay
values.

“Bendigonian” : The Bendigo field has three
features which are new to it: (1) For two
years past it has been, and is now, a one-
mine field ; (2) despite its limitations it now
attracts more attention in the Melbourne
market; and (3) for the first time in its
history its stocks have been systematically
assailed by bears. New Blue was the only
div.-payer last: year, and present prospects
are that it will remain so this year. The
principal hopes of success are in Hercules
and Ulster, but they will have to get a hustle
on to appear in the div. list this year, even
if their reefs contain the requisite gold. Car-
lisle, which looked a bright hope only a few
weeks ago, now reports unpayable yields.
Monument Hill has belied the prophets; it
had one good crushing—the others have been
disastrous failures. Legitimate prospecting
work is being done all over the field, and
any day there may be a good development.
But let the optimists talk ever so glibly, his-
tory is not repeating itself in this so-called
revival. Hitherto revivals have been signal-
ised by good discoveries simultaneously at
many points. It is a remarkable fact that
in the height of Bendigo’s prosperity its stocks
were almost ignored on Melbourne ’Change,
the probable explanation being that stocks
were so well supported by local people (the
working miners in particular) on legitimate
faith in prospects and values that there was
no scope for outside manipulators. Any bear
movement in the past has been on a very
modest scale, but now it seems to be develop-
ing into a common practice. Repetition of
such episodes as we have had in the past
month or so is not going to enhance the
reputation of Bendigo; they will destroy
confidence and alienate the support of the
very few genuine speculators we now have.

A. T. Woodward, of Bendigo, has per-
sistently maintained that oil would be found
at Bendigo East, about two miles from the
city, where the geological conditions are
quite distinct from those of the main reefing
belt. In spite of much official and unofficial
opposition and ridicule, he has been sinking
through the kaolinised strata, and the other
day sent a sample of the rock to Dr. F. H.
Campbell. The analyst collected the “dusty
matenal from the crevices of the rocks,” and
records a return of 2.9 p.c. of “heavy oil.”
The solid rock yielded similar oil, but not
in the same quantity.

The Yankee Reef Syndicate is still plug-
ging along at Trentham (Vic.). Six years
ago it unwatered an old 80ft. shaft, and with
Government assistance sank to 180 ft. North
and south over a length of 400 ft. it obtained
ilOOOoz., an average of .1 3dwt. The Mt. Ran-
kin Co. then acquired the property, put the
shaft down another 100 ft. and did a lot of
development work. But operations were not
profitable, and leases and plant passed back
to the syndicate last December. With '£l*o
Government subsidy the show was unwatered
and cleaned out again, and three crushings
have been put through: March, 28k>z. from
85 tons; April, 340 z. from 90 tons; May,
97-loz. from 170 tons (llldwt.). These
crushings were taken in bulk from both ends
of the 230 ft. level on a reef going from 3 to
7 feet wMe, and have enabled the syndicate
to pay all exes, except the Mines Department
grant. Development is proceeding north at
230 ft., and prospects of further crushings
are encouraging,

S. Aus. mining returns depend mainly on
minerals that are not metals, and on the
capricious demand of outside markets. For
1922 there was a horrible falling-off from the
usual million’s worth or thereabouts. The
total was only one-third of that, the drop
being mainly due to the temporary stoppage
of work at Iron Knob, and the slackness in
copper at Wallaroo and Moonta. Ironstone
fell from £587,000 to £58,000, and copper
from £106,000 to £73,000. Salt easily topped
the list with £109,000, which is less than
usual. The bright spots are the increases in
gypsum to £37,000 and in limestone to
£27,000. Gold, found all over the State, but
in quantities that just about pay for tucker,
is an also-ran with £4OOO, and silver just
looks in with ochre, talc and soapstone. Coal
does not appear at all in the results, but it
takes up much of the report; brown fuel is
being got, and experimented with, at Moor-
lands and Yorke’s Peninsula, and is being
bored for at Inkerman and Noarlunga.
* • • •
Mt. Mulligan Coal (Q.) is well under way
now after its last little strike, and having
reached an output of 200 tons is scouting
for orders. The present tonnage is the best
to date, but the manager reckons 400 or 500
tons daily is within easy reach if there is a
demand for that quantity. The ovens are
not yet in order for coke-making, but are
expected to be heated up shortly.
Mulligan’s shortage of coal orders is re-
flected on practically every field in Queens-
land. The trade has never been so depressed.
Several Ipswich collieries have closed down
in the last couple of months, Burrum field is
dull, and Blair Athol mines averaged only
12 shifts for April and produced 3280 tons.
The railways never used less for approxi-
mately the same mileage, owing to the cattle
and mining slump, and as Queensland has
very few large industries using coal the local
demand is very limited. Nevertheless, the
State collieries have been pushed hard, and
they alone are rapidly expanding. Bowen and
Baralba are increasing outputs rapidly, like-
wise the Styx, and they are taking the trade
of other established fields. What is the use
of pushing the Styx at the present time?
Admittedly an expensive field to open up, the
present condition of the trade does not war-
rant the outlay, although the field gives an
excellent fuel. Without further development,
Queensland collieries could produce four to five
times the quantity now being mined. Export
is the only solution, and the nightmare is the
suspicion that most of the coals, for one rea-
son and another, are not likely to be very
much in favor in foreign countries.
# * * •
Mines Minister Alf Jones, with another
run of three years ahead, is clearlv not going
to give oil prospecting cos. too much rope.
He is cutting out labor exemptions on
licenses, and has issued a general warning
that if holders don’t show that they mean
business within six months of the grant, the
licenses must go. Likewise a couple of geolo-
gists have to show that there is at least some
possibility of getting oil on an area, or the
axe will fall.
Having sampled the Billy Hughes Co.’s
latest fancy, the Bruce, manager Meredith
expects it to give “a large tonnage of pay-
able ore.” It is only two miles by dray-
road from the co.’s battery, and he recom-
mends opening it up. The eo. has spent a
lot of money on its string of mines, but most
of them have proved not quite good enough
to warrant further expenditure. Hopes
now lie in the Bruce, which Meredith expects
to give 1 (idwt. free gold at the battery, with
further recoveries from cyaniding. The Per-
severance has some 2oz. stone to help things
along.

Three more parties are having a go at
the old Woolgar field (N.Q.). Morris and
McGinlay have taken on the Perseverance*
and Have 40 tons at grass expected to aver-
age hn ouhce. Low, the well-known New
England (N.S.W.) prospector, and Schoop
Bros, have opened out the old Roman Grown,
from which Jimmy Mitchell got a 1-loz.
crushing at the 50ft. level. They have'2o'
tons up, and expect to get 100 tons before
crushing. In the past these two shows have
produced nearly 2000 oz. gold, but concen-
trates were run into the river. A Wilfley
has been installed, and that will enable the
newcomers to save concentrates. The reefs
go from 2to 7ft. wide, Vaughan and Mar-
tin have opened the Bell Brandon. This
line averaged lloz. for 800 tons, and work
is down only 100 ft. There’s talk of the
Mines Department erecting a bigger plant.
Over 30 lines of reef have been opened up on
the field.
**•••! *
The hopes of Holmes and party, at the Six-
Mile. Cooktown (N.Q.), have been blasted
by the latest sampling. One heap expected
to go 4oz. worked out at 26dwt., and 2dwt.
averages were got where 4dwt. was estimated.
The proposition shaded down to a 14dwt.
one, and was not considered nearly big enough
to tempt the Buchanan syndicate.
* * * *
Stannary Hills (N.Q.) should buck up
now Derrek’k battery is to make a fresh
start. The mines have been cleaned up and
plant overhauled, an air-compressor and drills
are being installed, and everything points to
satisfactory results. The Lass o’ Gowrie
and You and Me had large reserves blocked
out when the price of tin forced the co. to
close. The ore is low grade: previous crush-
ings ran about 2 p.c. At present prices
operations should be profitable with a com-
plete plant and an assured water supply.

The Castlemaine Thompsons’ cutter suc-
tion-dredge for Tongkah Compound is guar-
anteed to handle a monthly 100,000 c. yd. of
tin drift in far-off Malaya at 3d. a yd. The
plant is to be put under steam for £36,000.
Calls will be required to provide the cash
to work the new tin plot, and as the 150,000
shares are fully paid to 6s. Bd. capital is to
be increased.


CALLING IN THE SPECIALIST.
“The Bruce-Page Government has decided to shelve the question of public health reform by referring it to a Royal Commission.”

ney, and its cottages, mostly built before
sanitation was carried to extremes, are of a
familiar pattern. That is to say, they stand
in rows, and the front door opens into the
living-room. A feature is the “set-in” bed,
which is built with the house. It is a sort
of recess, and there are supports, across
which boards are placed to hold up the mat-
tress. Never in all the 150 years that the
stone building endures does any human

sides of it are wall. The air and light reach
it from only one side (that is sometimes
guarded by a door), and the bed-bug also

of no real value. The slow movements of a
rather ponderous young Methodist minister
raised his ire so much that every day he

end ; the miners stood around the open grave
in respectful silence; the Benediction was

been a couple of months a cot-patient in
Charlestown Hospital, near Majuba Hill,
South Africa, with a bad thigh wound. One,
day the O.C. came suddenly into the tent- —,
a big square one with four beds—and said that
if I could walk a little he could ship me for
a trip to England that day. I tried all I
knew; but much as I wanted that trip I
couldn’t manage it, and was passed over. A
few days later, when I had dozed off in the
afternoon, I woke to find that the side of
the tent and a lot of newspapers beside and
under it were blazing merrily. In two
seconds I found myself at the washstand in

water on the fire —I had quite forgotten I

bird over to the babbler he asked that a small
portion should be kept for him. Taking his
seat at mess the following night he demanded
his poultry, and the waiter trotted in with
a roast spud adorned with a few feathers.
The padre joined in the laugh, and his com-
ment raised it to a yell of delight. “That
was a Minorca I brought back, my boy ; not
an Irish pheasant.”
Of Melbourne's latest murder trial
David O'Keefe alias Kelly, who has got through
one trial and will shortly face another on a charge
of murdering the widow Overall at Warburton
(Vic.), is a puzzle, to amateur psychologists. Dur-
ing the four days of the grimmest test of his nerve
and courage he sat bolt upright, square-jawed and
impassive, listening to the Crown’s indictment with-
out a flicker of interest or indignation, even at the
insinuations regarding the disappearance of a girl
at Bacchus Marsh. Only once or twice he smiled
at some impromptu diversion, as in the matter of
testing the effect of arsenate of lead on beer, and
perhaps he changed color just a little when he was
hauled up from below to hear the jury’s decision
after six hours of waiting. A casual, physiognomist
would consider , his implacable front inconsistent
with that of a babbler prone to indulge in remand-
yard confidences, as the Crown pictured him.
Assuming that he was guilty, the only provocation
he would have for talking would be anxiety regard-
ing some missing garments which, according to one
Oliver, he had buried at Warburton. But a man
who on his own confession burnt a body carefully
in a tank, taking eight hours and consuming a
bottle of whisky on the job, could have had no
obvious motive for interring alleged evidence that
could have been destroyed by fire. This point pos-

sibly had some weight with the jury in considering
the character of the remarkable Oliver. There has
rarely been a greater flutter ,in a court than when
this spruce young criminal was unleashed by the
Crown. Well got-up, even to the extent of wear-
ing a Portland vest, pleasant-faced, perhaps over-
ingratiating, and with a manner that would earn
a Good Conduct prize in a Sunday-school, he has a
record that declares him an “habitual” of a dan-
gerous type. What the jury thought of him' they
alone can tell. What the accused’s counsel Brennan
thought was probably only half-expressed in his
excellent discourse for the defence. He would have
been justified in a much stronger snort against the
smellful .business of prison-yard “confessions” if he
hadn’t been forced to make use of similar evidence in
an attack on Oliver’s integrity.

with Doris, Irene, Ivy and Sylvia, all weirdly
jumbled in pronunciation, are common
enough. Among the boys patriotism is freely
expressed by such names as Kitchener, Jelli-
coe and Lloyd George—l have never heard
of a Billy Hughes yet. The pity of it all
is that when an infant is given an English
name in baptism its native moniker dis-
appears, so that future generations will
gradually lose all memory of their own old
names.

“E.J.M.”: Re a paragraph by “R.F.L.”
to the effect that the Ghoorka was shipped
out of France because he didn’t show to
advantage in modern conditions of warfare.
I fought with the Ghoorka in France in
1914-15, and a braver little man under shell-
lire I never met. The reason they were
withdrawn from France was simply that
there was more urgent work for them to do
in Mesopotamia, at India’s back door. As
a matter of fact, in December, 1915, the
whole Indian Army, comprising two divi-
sions, was shipped from France as part of
the movement for the relief of Townsend’s
force at Ivut el Amara. I fought with the
Ghoorkas all through the war on three
fronts, and learned to appreciate them thor-
oughly ; I was a private in the Connaught
Rangers in the Indian Army.

“Ex-Dig.”: The other day a respectable
Sydney citizen went home to find his quiet
suburban residence a scene of purple uproar.
There Were (1) his lawful wife, almost hys-
terical ; (2) another woman —who claimed
to be , his wife, and had brought a couple of
young children as a sort of evidence of good
faith —volubly asserting her rights; (3) a
legal gent, who professed to be there to see
that she got them. The unexpected claim-
ant declared that she had married the citi-
zen in England when he was with the
A.1.F., and as he had been with the forces
overseas, and the marriage certificate bore
his name—say, William Smith —and was
supported by a photograph which distinctly
resembled him, it looked like a fair bowl-out.
But a small thing saved the entirely inno-
cent William. He was able to point out
that his battalion was the Nth, while the
color-badge shown in the photograph was
that of the Umpteenth. He was further able
to remark that his cousin John Smith, who
strongly resembled him, belonged to that
unit. The police are now looking for John ;
and an angry cousin who bears the memory
of an extremely upsetting evening will have
something nasty to say if they meet.

TO A FLAPPER —AN ADMONITION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I thank you for the gay, glad eye
That you bestowed on me.
You say your days are swimming by
In swift frivolity.
You bid us note your life’s a dance,
A dizzy, whizzy whirl —-
You vamp all mankind at a glance,
A devil of a girl!
Above your cocktail you may smile,
And flash jazz-garters, too. .. .
Your mother, in another style,
Was just as gay as you;
And though her manners were demure,
We had a time that stirs
Old memories. Your wildness, sure,
Is innocent as hers!
A billowed petticoat that showed
An ankle trim and neat
Was then a lure; my spirit glowed
With poems on her feet.
There was no need for gartered knees
When to her heart I won.
I’d take such kisses as I’d please—
Or she perchance her fun.
Her pose was staid. A colleen swift
You now pretend to be;
And I’m prepared a while to drift
Whilst you make sport with me.
But, while I smile upon your bluff,
Yourself I rightly place;
I know you are not fast enough
For one like me to chase!.

TOOHEY'S.
“Bendoc” : The P.M.G.’s Department has
been conducting some interesting experiments
in long-distance telephony. On a recent Sun-
day officials successfully conversed with
their Adelaide colleagues, the feat being ren-
dered possible by the installation of a num-
ber of special “repeaters.” The department
has in view a transcontinental telephone line
which will enable Geraldton (W.A.) to ring
up and Converse with Townsvillq (Q.).
* * * *
“Pat Bushie”: Apropos “Laurie’s” re-
marks (B. 17/5/’23) on the intelligence of
juries. In many country towns trial by jury
is only a farce. The jurors have grown up
in the town or lived in it for years, and
everyone knows everyone else. In Deniliquin
(N.S.W.) one Sessions time I was lunching
at a hotel when a man who had been “stood
aside” by the Crown took a seat next me.
It was a sheep-stealing case, and the accused
had been caught skinning the animal.
“Jones’ll get out o’ it easy,” the man told
me. “Why, all them men on th’ jury was
kids here, and so was he. ’Course they’ll
acquit him. Why, t’ send him along would
be like hangin’ a brother.” He was right in
his prediction, anyway.
“A.W.8.”: J. B. Higginson (B. 17/5/’23),
in reviewing Gullett’s Volume VII of the
Official History, made a slip when, in refer-
ring to Gaza and Beersheba, he spoke of
“the Third Brigade’s galloping charge on the
Turkish trenches.” It was the Fourth Bri-
gade (the 4th and 12th Regiments) which
made that famous ride against the Jacko
machine-guns. The Turkish infantry never
forgot it, and subsequently, whenever they
were galloped, they invariably lost their
nerve and surrendered early in the fight,
while the Turkish cavalry “from that hour
practically faded out of the war.” A cap-
tured German staff-officer, in speaking of the
charge, wound up by saying: “They [the
Australians] are not soldiers; they are mad-
men.”
ONLY THAT AND NOTHING MORE.
THE BEAUTY : “Darling, I want”
THE BEAST: “Struth, you're never satisfied!
You want the earth, and if you had the
earth you'd want the universe. Well,
what is it now?”
THE BEAUTY : “A breath of fresh air , please .
George.”
WHOSE?
“She says she's single from choice.”
“Yes, but whose choice?”
“Tarwin”: In reply to “Old Grammar”
(B. 17/5/’23), I contend that the Public
Schools themselves are not responsible for
the hero-worship that youthful athletes are
surfeited with. It cpmes mostly from out-
side. For wrneks preceding the recent Head-
of-the-River contests in Melbourne, the even-
ing papers outdid each other turning out
pages of pictures and biographies of members
of the crews. The blame for this idolatry-
can hardly be laid at the doors of either the
boys themselves or the masters. “Old Gram-
mar” asks what Adamson and his brother
“heads” have done to keep sport in its proper
place. Well, one thing they have done, as
may be seen from the fixture-lists, is to keep
the number of games at the minimum—one
contest with each other school. As for mus-
cular “louts” being allowed to remain at
school solely on account of their rowing abili-
ties, the average age of the crews in this year’s
race quite fails to support any such idea.
One boy who rowed this year was not 16,
and the'majority were under 18.
“The Rumpus”: lie Kanakas and Chris-
tianity (B. 10/5/’23). When the sugar in
dustry in Queensland carried a black back-
bone I was a nipper running about the cane-
fields. The Kanakas were very sociable, and
I had the freedom of their little cane-thatched
villages. One day one of them proudly
showed me his quarter’s wages, which con-
sisted of 121 b. rice, 121 b. flour, 51b. brown
sugar, lib. tea, 1 pint black molasses, 1 tin
of “dog,” 2 red handkerchiefs and an oblong
piece of thin cardboard. “What—no money ?”
I asked. Tommy Tanna shook his head,
smiled and reverently lifted the scrap of
pasteboard. “What that one for?” I asked.
“That one,” said my Brown Brother, “ticket
to Heaven. Boss say that one good as 10
shillings.” I questioned the other Kanakas
and found they all held passes to Paradise
instead of filthy lucre.
• * * *
“Adelaide”: How easily amused are the
Truly Good ! At the recent Prohibition con-
ference in Adelaide, there was a reception
by Mayor Cohen. He had not long before
given a similar reception to a Liquor Trades’
conference, so the Prohibitionists realised
that they must not introduce any controver-
sial matter. “I must keep off the grass,”
said one speaker, who was getting argumen-
tative. Then a Voice interposed: “You mean
off the glass”; and the simple jest convulsed
the gathering. A Methodist conference fol-
lowed shortly. The organ went wrong dur-
ing a meeting, and when a reverend speaker
hoped that it would shortly “get the wind
up” he was rewarded with the usual Roars
of Laughter. It is dull work being Truly
Good; and anything that breaks the mono-
tony gets recognition beyond its merits.
“Harry Stottle”: Apropos of the recent
burglarious English entry into the bedroom
of the late Tutankhamen, there is not the
slightest doubt that spoliation of tombs was
practised as a fine art in ancient
the most adept in this
line of business being the under-
takers and tomb-builders them-
selves. Excavations at Tel-el-
Yahudiyeh which disclosed
plundered pottery coffins en-
closed in basalt and sand,
showed that the thief had known
exactly which block to move in
order to take the jewellery from
the breast of the corpse. And
a distinguished Yankee Egypto-
logist has left it upon record
that, in one of his excavations,
though the entrance and burial-
chamber of a large tomb were
intact, yet only a few bones
were found. A plunderer’s pas-
sage, leading out from the bot-
tom, communicated with a tun-
nel dug from a vertical shaft 25
feet deep beyond the area of the
tomb. It is supposed that the
foreman of the tomb-building
job was responsible for this rift
in the loot. He had evidently
got in early; probably (if it was a day-labor
job) the people who paid for the tomb also
paid for the means of robbing it.
“Jobber’s” yarn:—
The little ma’m’selle was visiting- her grand-
parents in the south of France, and the old people
were full of questions about the soldiers. Had
Lucille ever seen the Australians? What were they
like? And did she know anything of their religious
belief? Yes, Lucille had seen and spoken to many
Australians, but their religion was beyond her. These
men always worshipped in the open fields, or behind
a barn, anywhere but in a church. She had seen
large congregations, which always formed a big circle,
with a High Priest and his assistant in the centre.
The High Priest always held in his hand a small
piece of wood, on which the assistant would place
two bronze offerings, evidently intended for their
Deity. After some word from the assistant, which
sounded to Lucille like “yer set,” the Priest would
hurl these offerings towards Heaven. The eyes of
the worshippers would follow them in silent
adoration, and when the tokens dropped the eyes
would reverently fall to earth. Lucille could never
understand the ritual, but one day her curiosity
prompted her to get close to the High Priest, and
when the tokens came to earth, after having been
offered several times, she heard the Priest open his
sentence with a sacred Name and finish with “Two
blankards on bikes!”
* * * *
“Tin Hat”: I won’t back “Tarago’s”
entry (B. 17/5/’23) of the 22nd as the
battalion that sustained the greatest number
of casualties in the shortest time. That
record undoubtedly belongs to one of the
battalions of the sth Division, which went
over the top at Fleurbaix on July 19, 1916.
I have never seen any official figures of
casualties; the facts of the great blunder
were carefully smothered. But there wore
battalions that entered the line at their full
strength of approximately 1000 men in the
afternoon of the 19th and couldn’t muster
100 the next morning.

“K.V.” : A certain kiap, or district officer,
in the Pacific Islands recently gave orders
for the “calaboose” to he scrubbed with sand
and cocoanut husks and finally disinfected.
Unfortunately pidgin English provides only
the one word for both prison and prisoners,
and an hour later the police boy presented
himself before the kiap with, “Me scrub ’em
till blood ’e come; behind [after] me put
medicine [disinfectant] on ’em.” And so he
had. The unhappy prisoners had been most
effectively scrubbed and then doused.
“Clerk” discovers two points of view:—
On Anzac Day, when we worked as usual, our
business manager eyed the busy street from the
shop-window with the gloomy expression that Nap-
oleon might have worn at Waterloo when Blucher
arrived. “This is not the proper spirit in which
to observe Australia’s glorious day of remembrance,”
he bleated disapprovingly, speaking in an expan-
sive manner to the cat and myself. “We should
close every business concern. If I could only bring
the company to my way of thinking we should not
be working”—— He broke off as the offfce-boy
drifted in. “Well,” he asked rather eagerly, “did
you call at Tatt.’s?” The boy grinned in the intel-
ligent and aggravating manner peculiar to some
people when about to impart bad news. “Yessir,”
he said brightly. “But when I went there the hall
bloke told me they wasn’t payin’ out to-day, ’count
it bein’ Anzac Day.” The old boy snapped his fin-
gers impatiently. “It’s a scandal the number of
holidays we have,” he barked irritably. “Too many
by far ! If I had my way I’d cut half of them out.
Dammit!”
“Spare Corporal” : Old Sam Sharp was at
least a rival of “Tarago’s” Digger (B.
24/5/’23) who hadn’t time to pull the pins
out of his bombs. When we were keeping
the Hun back (on bully beef and Anzac
wafers) between Meteren and Bailleul, Sam,
who was an “original” and sick of it, threw
himself right out of such little cover as we
had, and wholeheartedly fired into the ad-
vancing hosts. Our platoon-officer crept
along and profanely exhorted him to get
back into cover. Sam took no notice until
he had emptied his magazine; then he half-
turned, as he put in another clip. “I’m sick
STILL A SOURCE OF WEALTH.
“Violet's face is no longer her fortune."
“No, indeed. But the chemist is doing pretty well out
of it."
of this blanky war; I want to finish it,” he
explained. And he proceeded with the work
of wiping out the entire Fritz armies.
MY GREY CAT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My grey cat sits on the window-sill,
Where the green blind sways in an idle breeze
That brings me a spicy scent and slow
From the bitter-honeys of cedar-trees.
My grey cat sits in a yellow glow,
And his eyes are mysteries.
My grey cat sits on the window-sill.
And he looks at the sunlit blooms;
So it seems he sat by a rock-hewn gate,
A guard of the Unlit Rooms,
To the clash of cymbal and sistrum plate
At the sealing of the tombs.
And the flapping blind is a black bat-wing
O’er a thousand-year-old sleep,
And the bitter-sweets from the cedar-trees
Art the dusts of fragrance hidden deep
In the heart of the hills of mysteries
That a sullen secret keep.
My grey cat sits on the window-sill. . . .
There were grey cats, too, in old Pharaoh’s day,
And they crouched at the feet of kings, and slept,
Till, purring gently, they slid away,
And into the breast of a queen they crept,
And in jewelled dusk they lay.
My grey cat sits on the window-sill,
And he dreams, no doubt, of a hundred things;
Td his fancy, guarded by yellow eyes,
The rustling blind is as Raa’s great wings.
But he keeps his counsel (for he is wise)
Of the days when cats were kings.

Charles Page, of Clarence River (N.S.W.).
He got his majority, a D. 5.0., M.C. and a

Francis Marshall Dickenson, late secretary
of the Broken Hill Prop., has taken his way
to the stars. “Dick” came from the West
of England to Australia about the time
William Knox was gathering round him
able men to push along the newly-created
Broken Hill silver-mining industry. Knox
was a shrewd selector of lieutenants—and
he specially chose Dickenson to be his secre-
tary and confidential assistant. “Dick” left
the 8.14. P. Co. to go on the Stock Ex* hange
with G. D. Meudell, but was induced to re-
turn to the dual secretaryship n f the Prop,
and the British when Knox joined the Board
of the former. Astute and industrious he
was also modest and retiring, and, when at
his best, charming and sympathetic.
“Splinter”: Fighting parsons? I nomi-
nate Hare, who came from Townsville way
in August. 1914,
and applied for a
chaplaincy. There
were no vacancies,
so he joined up, was
made a sergeant,
and as such saw
Gallipoli through
with the 7th Bat-
ter y. He was
offered a chaplain’s
job after the evacu-
ation, but turned
it down, remarking
that he preferred to
be right in the
thick of it. They
made him a lieu-
tenant later. He
used to conduct
services in his spare
time in France, but
soldiered on until a
shell took him.
Lawyer JOE
WOOLF, who
for over 30
years has been
giving THE BUL-
LETIN good advice
in Melbourne.
Herbert Maitland, probably the greatest-
surgeon Sydney, if not Australia, has pro-
duced, died last week. When his wife left
him with a cup of tea at 4 o’clock he was
well: she came back a little before 6 to find
him dead of “athlete’s heart.” He was a
victim of the passionate desire to keep fit
which had dominated him all his life. Two
years ago he got his first warning. If he
had taken a six months’ rest he might be
alive to-day. Instead he went on working
as tigerishly as ever, and with some friends
began a course of early-morning surfing,
boxing and Swedish exercises. He was a
champion fisherman, and was well-known on
the Monaro streams; but his favorite resort
was Port Stephens in the tunny and Spanish
mackerel season. To deal with these big
fish he had an enormous collection of rods,
reels and lines: they almost filled one of the
rooms at the Macquarie-street home which
he built shortly before the war, and which
he used as both residence and surgery.
When Vic. Premier Lawson reached
America he received a reminder that his
Ministry had on May 29 lifted the record for
the longest-lived in the State. Previously
the belt belonged to the first Turner team
(1894-99) whose score was 1895 days.
Edmund Resch, the rich brewer, died last
week in Sydney. Perhaps the best thing he
ever said was about his younger brother
Emil. Edmund had no social graces; Emil,
partly because he had a wonderfully fine
voice, was induced to cultivate a few.
Edmund rather despised them. “If Emil
had as much money as I’ve got,” he said,
“he’d put on a belltopper to go to bed in.”
Edmund made his start at Wilcannia in
that river town’s most affluent days; he
picked up a few more coins in the early years
of the Barrier; then he bought the Waverley
brewery in Sydney for a trifle in the days
when Australia was feeling very sick after
its boom, and when the tide turned he coined
money. He made a mistake during the war;
but there were other members of the family
who proved sterling Australians.
Christopher Newton, who died at Manly
(N.S.W.) last week, was the last surviving
son of the head of a famous old Sydney
firm of softgoods merchants. His father was
the man who went bankrupt, recovered his
fortune, repaid his creditors with interest
and was presented by them with a fine
yacht as an expression of esteem. He mar-
ried a sister of Pope Cooper, the Queensland
ex-Chief Justice, and she survives him.
John Lee, who died in Sydney on May 22,
was a son of William ljee, of Milbank
(N.S.W.), and grandson of that William Lee
who pioneered Bathurst Plains soon after the
mountains were first crossed in 1813, and
represented Roxburgh in the first and second
Parliaments. The old pioneer left a large
family of stalwart sons, all, with one excep-
tion, on the land. George was at Lee Holme,
James at Larras Lake, John at Bylong, Wil-
liam and Henry at Milbank, and Tom at
Woodlands. Edward was a barrister and
Crown Prosecutor.
Ivor MacGillivray, 83 on May 24, is one
of the three survivors of the first batch of
Labor members returned to the S. Aus.
Assembly in 1893. The other two are ex-
Speaker F. W. Coneybeer and ex-Federal
Minister W. O. Archibald, who sat with
Mac. for Port Adelaide until 1910. Mac.
himself went on sitting for this constituency
for about a quarter of a century. Port
Adelaide has been his home for nearly 50
years. For 12 years previously he was on
the West Coast of M.L., at one time mining
with Dick Seddon.
The letter B seems always liable to get
into the names of Prime Ministers these
days. Observe its commanding position in
the monikers of five out of the last 10: Ben-
jamin Disraeli, titled as Beaconsfield; Bal-
four ; Campbell Bannerman; Bonar Law;
Baldwin. The Commonwealth falls quite
naturally into the prevailing fashion with
its Bruce. And didn’t we also have Barton
--and Billy?
Died at Wellington, Walter Dinnie, for-
merly Maoriland’s Commissioner of Police.
He was chief inspector at Scotland Yard
when, in 1904, he got the M.L. job in suc-
cession to Tunbridge, also from the Yard.
On retiring six years later he was made pre-
sident of the Toherau Maori Land Board.
Dinnie was a Scotsman, and his best coup
was the arrest of a gang of international
crooks who devised an ingefiious scheme to
loot the bank at Monte Carlo. Handwriting
and finger-prints were his hobbies, and he
was a recognised authority on both.
The Australian Clerical Association in
Sydney gained two more political members
when Greig and Loughlin, M’s.L.A., joined
the other day. They rushed in to avoid re-
marks at the next A.L.P. conference that
they are not members of any organisation.
The Clerical Union is full of politicians, in-
tending politicians and ex-politicians. Stuart
Robertson has been a member since the
Clerks’ Union was formed in 1908; and
Campbell Carmichael was a member at the
same time. Senator Duncan, now a Liberal,
clung to his membership*until he changed his
suit; and it was the early union attachment
of Molesworth, M.L.A. Griffith, Holman,
Arkins, T. S. Crawford (ex-M.L.A., but now
Crown Prosecutor), and many others are or
have been members; and Percy Coleman,
M.H.R., was recently secretary. At one
State election 26 members stood as candi-
dates, and nine got in.
John Rowland, who died at East Kangaloon
(N.S.W.) the other day at 81, was a native of
Iviama, and at 16 decided to try his luck at
Lambing Flat diggings, and walked all the
way with a companion. Rowland used to
tell the story that once a coach in which he
was crossing the mountains toppled over,
and all the passengers were killed except him-
self—he was caught in a tree and didn’t
finish the fall with the others.
Frank Burgen Standish, a Maoriland
pioneer, passed out at Ashburton the other
day at 87. A son of Thomas Standish, of
Standish Hall, Lancashire, he claimed to bo
connected by blood-ties with the Miles Stand-
ish of history and romance. He arrived
in M.L. in 1844, and saw some rough days
in early Taranaki. During the trouble with
the Maoris that led up to the battle of
Waireka he received the personal thanks of
Governor Gore-Browne for a daring ride with
despatches through the dusky warriors’ lines.
The axe has fallen heavily on Sydney
Repat., and among the long-service officers
who are to move on on June 30 is Deputy-
Commissioner Lt.-Col. A. G. Farr. He is
an old Defence Force hand, was on the
Peninsula for a time, and as “the Old Man”
at Sydney Repat. was liked by both the staff
and the Diggers. Any Billjim with a grouch
believed that if he could personally see “The
Colonel” he would get satisfaction, and usu-
ally he was right; though one disgruntled
Digger did blame him for a disallowed claim,
and pinned this couplet on a partition in
Repat.:—
My pension claim you meanly bar;
Thou art sO “near,” though thou art Farr.
I-lis next job is to-be in Westralia.
Archpriest McKenna, of Geelong (Vic.),
celebrates the golden jubilee of his ordina*
tion in June. Other Vic. priests who have
jubileed and still live are Dean Hegarty
(Carlton) and M. J. Watson (East Mel-
bourne). Fifty years ago Hegarty and
McKenna were under the late Archdeacon
Slattery at Geelong. Since then McKenna
has ministered in many parishes, and had a
term at St. Pat.’s as Vicar-General of the
diocese, which he administered when the
late Arch. Carr went abroad.
FORGAN SMITH , Minister for Public
Works, Queensland —the youngest mem-
ber of Theodore's team.
“The Oldest”: May I repeat, “Muzzie”
(B. 24/5/’23) notwithstanding, that the
late James Harrison manufactured ice in
“pig-iron” bars at his factory in Franklin-
street, off Elizaheth-street, Melbourne, in the
very early ’sixties? I was in the factory
many a tune, for I lived in the next house.
No doubt the icemaker did experiment in
Geelong, but he established himself in Mel-
bourne as the larger market over GO years
ago. By the way, I have never before seen
it contradicted that he was sub. of the Age
soon after its foundation.
“Plasmon” on a difficult subject:—
No doubt about it, the cartoonists are yearning
for the return of Billy Hughes. They struggle piti-
fully to make Bruce interesting, but the best of
them can only lengthen his nose and give his face an
impertinence it never wears in life. Wells, of the
Melbourne Herald, tries to invest the Prime Minis-
ter with an appearance of arch-deviltry by parting his
hair in the middle and turning up the ends like
embryo horns ; but this is about as character-reveal-
ing as if he were fitted with bowyangs. J. C. Bancks,
who is doing bright work on Melbourne’s Evening
Sun, has discovered a parrot-like aspect in the Bruce
profile, but the rest of the man is suggestive of an
alert hairdresser. The Bulletin’s Tom Glover re-
produces some of Bruce’s essential sleekness. But all
overlook the only caricaturable feature —the rippling
line of the hair front, which has an awful suggestion
of a toupe about it. However, all would be forgiven
him if the chaste person would only do something
that would make pictorial history. If he piit his
feet on the table, or said “Booh!” to a deputation,
the Black-and-White Union would present him with
an illuminated address.
Dead at 78, Paddy Boland, an ex-Mayor
of Launceston. He worked in Douglas and
Collins’s solicitor’s office for about a quarter
of a century, but left it on entering munici-
pal politics. When Paddy was a sapling he
was one of the best fielders in Tas. cricket,
and his bat carried a very vigorous punch.
He represented the Speck in nine inter-State
matches.
“Gallery”: There were two men at the
Premiers’ meeting for whom the chamber, in
which they sat had interesting memories.
Acting-Premier Oakes (N.S.W.) was at one
time a Senator, and his colleague Bavin
had previously served there as Barton’s sec-
retary.
“Collonna”: Joseph Cornelius Marconi
(born Marney), the man who proved that
ugliness in the goanna is only skin-deep, was
killed recently in Brisbane, and left about
£lO,OOO. Advertising was- the basis of his
success. At the State elections of 1918 he
stood for Bulimba (Brisbane) as an Inde-
pendent, but he was counted a better oint-
ment-maker than politician, got. only 122
votes and lost his deposit. Born in London,
Marconi came to Australia in his youth, and
was only 47 when he went out.
Captain W. O. Berryman, who won Maori-
land’s first Military Cross in the war—at
Loos in T5 —died recently in New York.
He used to be master of the Mount Egmont
hounds in the old days, but since the Armis-
tice had wandered about a bit, and among
other things had an unsuccessful shot at
British politics.
THE DESIDERATUM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.l
“Mr. Stanley Baldwin, Britain’s new Prime Min-
ister, ip widely eulogised by the press for the posses-
sion of the same solid business qualities that dis-
tinguished Mr. Bonar Law, to whose ‘restraining
sagacity’ Mr. Lloyd George pays a tribute.”
The world is aweary 'of tales
Vibrating with passion and throb;
A couple of wizards from Wales
Are out of a permanent job;
A thankless Glaswegian mob
Off Winston has taken the paint—
What counts in a Minister’s nob
To-day is Sagacious Restraint.
A growing suspicion assails
All tribunes who thunder or sob ;
The glamor of barnstorming pales,
A torrent of “gab from the gob”
Just stamps you a garrulous swab;
In rhetoric there’s interest faint.
But to Downing-street still you may lob
If your forte is Sagacious Restraint.
Who plays to the gall’ry, or rails,
Or ripsnorts, retires for a blob.
The wind’s out of Birkenhead’s sails.
The Cecils are three for a bob.
Some may conjure, like coins from the fob,
Deft phrases and metaphors quaint,
But they merely the utterer rob
Of his rep. for Sagacious Restraint.
Envoy.
When craft and when artifice fails,
And wiles wherewithal we’re acquaint,
There’s a season when nothing avails
So sure as Sagacious Restraint.

“Roma”: Reason's “Going for a Drive”
(B. 10/5/’23) reminds me of a cocky who had a
knowing horse called Billy. When he wanted to
catch him he used to rattle a dish containing a few
handfuls of corn, and the prad always came for it.
Cocky was out of corn one day, so he rattled some
small stones in the dish and caught Billy by this
ruse. Next time he wanted the horse he took out
dinkum corn; but AVilliam wasn’t risking it, and
the old man spent half the morning walking round
and round the paddock pleading to no purpose: “It’s
torn, Billy—by God, it’s corn!”
“Early Bird”: Women shearers? Torah,
between Broken Hill and Wilcannia (N.S.W.), is owned
and managed by Mrs. Renhardt and her three daugh-
ters. It generally carries about 3000 sheep, and all
the shearing, horse-breaking and fencing is done by
the three girls. Miss Biddy is the “gun” among
them. One shearing season a drover travelling with
12,000 sheep stopped at Torah, and the three girls
shore the lot. Every year small mobs on the road
are shorn by the sisters.
RIGHT DRESS.
PAT : “Yus, women are tukin ’ part in everything nowa-
days. We’ll have 'em in the army next.”
DENIS: “No, never! The arms that defends the counthry
will always have trousis on ’em!”
“Condamine”: (“Centre” (B. 10/5/’23)
is rash in saying on his one little experience that
“ringbarking does not set springs of water breaking
out anywhere.” His misfortune was merely the
result of a dry spell, and would have been the same
had he Planted trees instead of destroying them.
Riiwbarking in granite country invariably causes
springs of more or less permanence to break out—
not in the gullies but a little way up the sides cf
the hills Travellers on the line from Tallarook to
Yea (Vic.) can see cleared country full of springs
(the excess of water on the steep mountain-sides has
caused landslides), while the unimproved hills are
as dry as Greenwood’s electorate isn’t. At Granga,
on the Upper Murray, numbers of 20-acre blocks
available for selection were untouched on account
of their dryness ; but every block that was selected
and cleaned up duly delivered the wet goods. A
catchment will deliver more water into a tank
from a given rainfall and hold it much longer in a
ringbarked than in a heavily-timbered area. Know-
ing this, selectors in holey brigalow country pick
out some of the largest holes and ring a few acres
around them in order to provide a temporary water-
supply.

“Monaro”: “N’lmporte” scores a miss
when he nominates the whippet as the fastest animal
(B. 10/5/’23). A mere 30 yards in 100 (not 50)
is the utmost start one can concede a man; and then
it doesn’t always win. Admittedly a whippet gets
going quickly, but “Snail” asked for speed—a dif-
ferent thing. The speed-kings are the greyhound,
racehorse, cheetah (600-yard flash) and gazelle. The
racehorse-greyhound argument frequently comes up.
Last year London Referee conducted a series of
tests. Results showed that for 880 to 1000 yards
(a fair test) a good greyhound can beat a racehorse.
My vote is for the greyhound as the fastest thing
that runs.
* * * *
“Dawsonia”: “Midgehope’s” two shooters
who bagged 12,000 kangaroos in two years (B.
26/4/’23) can be easily beaten by Tom Davis’s
tally on Wooroona station (C.Q.), over 40 years ago,
when Charles White was managing for John Living.
Davis owned a knowing old horse, branded “T. 8.,”
with which he used to stalk the ’roos in both day-
light and moonlight. His weapon was a shot-
gun. He used to walk by the shoulder of the
unsaddled prad, which would graze closer and closer
to the unsuspecting ’roos until within gunshot. In
this way as many as seven were shot in one lot. One
moonlight night Tom’s hag was 120 —not a bad
record. For the year he netted over £3OO for scalps,
at 9d. each —which works out at about 8000.
* * » *
“Baukinia”: Generally Binghi is curiously
non-committal in regard to names of places of alleged
abo. nomenclature. If you ask him if a place is
called so-and-so, he’ll readily agree ; but if, instead,
you ask him to give you the name of the place he
almost invariably asks: “What name you call him?”
When told, he’ll say: “Yeh, thasri’.” In consequence
of this peculiarity and the lack of knowledge of it by
the white man, many places, mountains, rivers, etc.,
get mutilated names fastened on them. Meeting old
Billy, King of Ross River, one day at Townsville (Q.),
I pointed to Castle Hill and said: “What name that
feller, Billy?” Came the question quickly: “What
name you bin call him, Boss?” “Oh,” I said, “white
feller call him ‘Castle Hill’ ; what name you bin call
him?” He said: “Me bin call him ‘Bootheringa.’ ” I
said: “No fear, Billy; ’nother feller blackfellow all
bin call him ‘Gutheringa.’ ” Drawing himself up with
kingly dignity William replied: “’Nother feller black-
feller plurry liar; he no know—me bin born jes’ Tong
here.” I questioned other old abos. on the matter, and
they could not, or would not, commit themselves, but
referred me to King Billy. Does any Abo. historian
know the meaning of the words “Bootheringa” and
“Gutheringa,” and which is the one more likely to
refer to Castle Hill ?
* * * *
“Condamine”: About the best aquatic feat
I ever saw a horse put up was in the Moonee River
(Q.). My brother and I were camped in a bend
on the side opposite the road, and as there was
impenetrable scrub and pear growing to the river’s
edge on each side of us, the only way out was to
cross the river. A typical Bananaland storm occurred
one night, and we woke in the
morning to find the river some-
thing like a torrent, and a day’s
supply in the tucker-box. It was
a case of get across or starve.
Our travelling apparatus was a
thin, tall horse and a light spring-
cart. We didn’t know the depth
of water or the swimming powers
of our prad; but the crossing was
only 20 yards, so we cljanced it.
After removing everything mov-
able from the cart Ted got a fly-
ing start, arid sent old Blinker at
the water full lick. Once started
down the steep hank he couldn’t
stop, and the first rush took him
well into the middle of the
stream. Ted was standing on the
floor of the cart, and the water
was up to his armpits, so it was
well over Blinker’s head. I was
mentally kissing our turnout good-
bye when the old nag’s head re-
appeared. He reared on his hind
legs and spurted water from his
nostrils like a double-barrelled
fire-hose; then down he went like
a submarine. He was up again
a few yards further' on, and a
couple of dives like this landed
him safely qn the other side. I
can’t swear whether he crawled on the bottom or
swam or did a little of each, hut anyhow he is the
only horse I ever heard of that pulled a cart across
a flooded river. » * *

The Overlander On Gillindoon station,
on the Macquarie (N.S.W.), in the early eighties, an
abo. woman died in childbirth, and the grandmother
<*>ok the infant and commenced suckling it. In a
few days her n- a k glands were quite active and gave
the youngster an abundant supply. This was fully
seven years after the old lady had given birth to her
last offspring. The milky phenomenon has been
JUST CAUSE.
“What are you crying for, my little man?”
“BOO-hoo —muvver caller farcer a boiled owl, and farter called muvver a blinkin cow!”
“But that's nothing to cry about.”
“Isn’t it? If they're that, what am I?”
known to have happened on a few rare occasions—
with both male and female —in other parts of the
world; but who has heard of a similar instance in
Australia ?
* * * »
“Garryowen” : I’m having a spell in the
country, and I find life not altogether devoid of
incident. Last week one of the cows went off her
feed and shut off the milk supply. Mick, the handy-
man, felt her all over and discovered a lump half-
way down her neck, and diagnosed it as an apple
stuck in her gullet. Bill, the boss’s son, and Herb,
after examining the patient, decided that the apple
must be shifted. Each in turn shoved his hand
and most of his arm into Strawberry’s interior, much
to her annoyance, but failed to locate the obstacle.
Mick was the last to prospect, and Strawberry, hav-
ing evidently had enough of it, bit his hand rather
badly. Bill rode all round the district to borrow
a gag, but failed to get one. They later improvised
a gag, and Bill invented from his fertile brain an
instrument to perform the operation. This was like
a giant catheter, and consisted of a rubber pipe with
a wire inside to stiffen it. This also failed, but
made Strawberry more annoyed than ever. As a last
resource they tried a broom-handle; but the only
effect this had was to cause a violent reflex action
inside the patient which spoilt a good pair of Bill’s
trousers. Next morning they sent for the local
bush vet. This gentleman, after a careful examina-
tion, announced that they had been making every
effort with the aid of a broom-handle to push a
good lump of the unfortunate beast’s thyroid carti-
lage down into her lower regions. Ha said Straw-
berry had some digestive trouble, and gave her a
bottle of linseed oil, remarking that, if it had no
other effect, it would relieve the sore throat they
had given her. Bill said afterwards he knew all
the time it wasn’t an apple. It’s a pity Straw-
berry’s remarks were beyond translation.
* * * *
“The Praste”: “Alkaloid” (B. 26/4/’23)
pokes borak at “X2X” for quoting Binghi’s herbal
treatment of gonorrhoea; yet, a couple of years ago
in C. Queensland, I saw an old abo. in about a fort-
night cure a shearer who had had the disease for
over three months. A medical examination on his
return to Sydney four months later proved that the
cure was absolute. Yet even a specialist, using the
most modern methods, will never guarantee to cure
under six weeks, and he usually takes longer.
* * * *
“Centre” : Re mammy ’roos carrying alien
young in their pouches. On the station where 1
worked in Queensland the boss’s children had several
animals as pets, including a lady ’roo. The youngest
daughter owned a Persian cat, also a lady, which
rejoiced the heart of her small owner by having
seven kittens. One day the child carried the seven
little scratchers in her pinny across the yard to
where old Ma ’Roo was drowsing, and before the
old girl knew what was happening she found she’d
a full cargo of squirming kittens on board. Sh°
sat up with a puzzled look on her face, and then
began to investigate. The kittens commenced to
meow in no uncertain manner. That did it, and in
another second Mammy was off, knocking the small
girl over and spilling kittens all over the landscape
as she went hurtling towards the horizon, ffvidently
wondering what she’d eaten that so disagreed with
her interior arrangements.
* * * *
“Wandi”: Bushmen often remark on the
stupidity of emus in parading up and down a wire
fence that they could easily jump over; but I reckon
the goanna earns first prize in the Silly Stakes. I
have seen deep tracks along each side of a netting
fence worn by goannas in following the line up
and down in search of an opening, although they
could hop over in a couple of seconds by scrambling
up a post. In some ways the go. is cunning, and
that makes this fence foolishness all the more remark-
able.
WHAT YOU'D CALL CAREFUL.
“There's the boss pickin' up dead wool again
—'e’s about the meanest man I ever see.”
“Blimey, that's nothin’. I seen 'im once
takin ’ wool outa bloomin’ bird’s nest.”
“Zimra”: We were discussing elongated
carousals when Mick chipped in. “Long jags, is
it? My old man had just got the brood-mare back
after a visit to one of the crack sires, when he
decided that it was time to quench the drought. He
had a few beers, and, when he sobered up, he found
that the colt had won both Derbies and was a hot
favorite for the Cup.” We bought Michael another
pot.
(Continued on page 24.)
THE LIARS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Joseph Carruthers, speaking at the Rural Credits
Conference at Taree, said the cry that farm-life was
one of solitude and drudgery was a damnable lie.”
We are living on the land,
And the life is simply grand,
And a liar is the man who says we slave;
It’s a pleasing paradise,
It’s a heaven doubled twice;
And the man who says it’s quiet is a knave.
Once a month they hold a hop
In the hall at Bunchytop
(It’s a fixture for the night the moon is full) ;
We can get there round the hill,
For the road is cornin’ still —
It’s been cornin’ since before we bought our bull.
We can land there, ridin’ hard,
For the tenth dance on the card,
Leavin’ home as soon as all the pigs are fed ;
And we get back in the dawn,
Change our togs and kill a yawn,
Do our fourteen hours of toil and go to bed.
On an ordinary night
We can get a lamp alight—
Or a candle if we’re out of kerosene —
Put ourselves to bed and read
Of the happy life we lead,
And forget the blasted droughts and all between.
And we thank you, Mr. Joe,
For the lies you’re layin’ low
Of the drudgery that we’re supposed to do —
And the men who drift away
From the country ev’ry day
Ought to take the good example set by you.

TAKING CARE OF THE LITTLE DARLING.
SCHOOIMARM : “Aren't yon going to school?”
REGINALD: “Nope! Ma says it’s too wet for us to go out to school to-day!”
“C.H.S.”: “El Dorado’s” gruesome relic
(B. 26/4/’23) reminds me that I saw a worse thing
in life at Cohuna, a closer settlement on the Murray.
An Ayrshire bull, not satisfied with his own harem,
was continually breaking through fences to those of
his rivals; so the owner to stop him ran a piece of
No. 8 galvanised-wire from the tip of one horn
through the beast’s nostrils and fastened it to the
tip of the other horn. As the bull grew the wire
split the nose, and by the time I discovered it the
wire had cut in fully three inches. Being a John
Hop by profession, I gave the owner four hours to
remove the torture. But it meant the death of the
bovine Lothario. Three weeks later he was ground
into sausages for Melbourne housewives.
* * * *
“Wart”: “Sis and Eight” (B. 3/5/’23)
can also see an eel-fare at tne top of the Cataract
Gorge, Launceston (Tas.), during January. The
millions of elvers don’t seem to use the main stream
so much as the little trickles between the rocks at
the sides. The kids scoop them up in handfuls. I
have seen them climbing six feet up an almost per-
pendicular rock that had a sheet of water pouring
over it. Many of them wriggle upwards on rocks
that are kept wet with the spray. Those that get
a little too far out frizzle in the sun, and the birds
have a great feast. Many find their way into dams
and lakes that are not connected with the river—
probably making overland journeys at night. Plenty
of them reach the lakes at the top of the Tiers,
4000 ft. high, and the best part of 300 miles, as the
■ rivers wind, from the sea. The “eel run,” when the
matured eels make for the salt water, occurs in
March. At the back of Cressy, with a purse-net
across the lake river, I have helped to catch a chaff-
bag full of them between dark and midnight. Some
old warriors grow to be 6ft. long and weigh over
301 b.
* * * *
“Perdix”: “Aide de Camp’s” failure to
get a pair of kookaburras for introduction into the
Speck (B. 3/5/’23) leads me to remark that a few
years ago Dr. Lade liberated a pair in the Scotts-
dale district (N.-E. Coast), and now there is quite
a happy family of them there. I believe that no-
where else in the island are Jacks to be found at
liberty.
* * * *
“Pedro”: Botanists will tell you that the
bamboo, the eocoanut and the peanut are about the
most valuable trees economically that grow out of
the ground anywhere. Let Australia add a fourth
in Sterculia diversifolia, better known locally as
the kurrajong. The leaves of the lcurrajong are
first-class feed for stock, and many a herd and flock
have been saved thereby in drought time. The rcots
of the young trees are often eaten by people who
say that they are like turnips in flavor, only nicer.
The leaves contain so much water, even in dry seasons,
that two or three of them are as good as a draught
from the tap. Roasted, pounded and steeped in hot
water, with a little sugar added, the seeds make
a very pleasant drink. The inner bark fibres make
fine, strong string and rope and can be woven
into durable mats. Finally, the kurrajong is one
of the handsomest trees that grows, and ought to
be more frequently used for ornamental purposes than,
for instance, the skinny and starved-looking imported
pines that disfigure so many “grounds.”
“Cyrano”: Another acclimatised chicken
has come home to roost in Maoriland, and a hefty
chicken it is. For years the Government and
the acclimatisation societies encouraged deer to
breed in the back country—they would be
such an attraction to the tourist, y’ know.
Now there are 300,000 deer in the country,
and the system of limited license to sportsmen has
had no effect in checking their increase. The}' eat
pasture that is needed for cattle and sheep, jump the
farmer’s fences, damage his crops, and injure forests,
in some districts—Rotorua, for instance —they have
become a perfect curse. The Forestry Department,
now a live concern, estimates that they do £lBO,OOO
worth of damage in a year, and bluntly says that
the country must choose between deer and the much-
needed forests. License fees paid by sportsmen
total a paltry £l3OO a year, and the percentage of
the population that pays them is a fraction of one.
As for the effect of the deer on the tourist traffic, it
doesn’t seem to amount to a row of pins. At last
the regulations governing shooting have been relaxed,
and the Government has conferred on the problem
with all the acclimatisation societies; but it looks
as if something pretty drastic may have to be done.
You’d think the rabbit would have made men care-
ful, but this deer business shows that it didn’t.

“Spinifex”: I don’t quite know what
“Tom Pepper” (B. 12/4/’23) means by ’roos shot
“at a sitting” ; but I once shot three, all fair-sized,
with one bullet, and as two had joeys I got five scalps
for one .44 Winchester bullet. Two were shot right
through under the arms, and the third had his hip
broken. Two at a shot is not uncommon. But,
talking of records “at a sitting,” what about scrub
wallabies? If you care to adopt a cruel expedient
get into a good scrub and wound one wallaby. If
he scrabbles round and kicks up a row, you can just
sit there and shoot. I’ve known a shooter get 21
without moving—and I don’t expect that to be a
record.

“Bill R.”: The queer area in Maoriland
mentioned by “Mamaku” (B. 10/5/’23) where, cn
well-grassed lands, horses thrive while cattle die
of starvation, has a vice versa counterpart on the
N.S.W. Southern Tableland. On the northern slopes
of Mt. Gibraltar paddocked cattle fatten readily
throughout the warmer parts of the year, but horses
qualify for the bonemill. The unscientific bushmcn
of the region attribute the fact to a sourness in the
herbage which, though distasteful to a horse, >s
relished by the less fastidious bovine.
* * * *
“Cartot”: You can’t always tell the age
of a tree by the rings showing at the end of a log.
In some trees the rings may fall far short of the
years. Particularly is this so in the case of giants
belonging to districts subject to drought and bush-
fires. A waterless year may result in the growth of
the tree being so small that the corresponding ring
cannot be observed with the naked eye. And if a
fire happens to bum the tree on one side, the growth
during the period of recuperation will be forced over
to the opposite side, making that year’s ring look as
though it has been superimposed on the preceding
one. Through bushfires, also, trunk-lobes are caused
in a tree, and these often restrict the growth of the
following three or four rings, so that the latter
look as though they were all merged into one and
are likely to be counted as such. Hence, a tree
possessing 60 visible rings, instead of being 60
years old, may be 100 or more. And as there are
very few big trees which have not at some time or
other been damaged by fire or drought, telling the
age by the ring method is about as reliable as esti-
mating the birthday of a henna-haired lady by the
color of her locks.
* * * *
“Bolkie Bill”: So “Sixenate” (B. 3/5/’23)
has evidently heard the Pitt-street pub yarn about
there being no eels in waters running west. Tell
him that I catch eels in the Murray' at Albury
every' year—and no stragglers either. Moreover, it
would take more than an unsuitable river entrance
to keep them out. And I have seen a Murray cod
weighing about 51b. caught in a tank in the Tirana
district, the nearest running water being 20 miles
away.
“Nitellub”: I can’t back up “Aide do
Camp’s” evidence on behalf of the kookaburra (B.
3/5/’23). Recently I had a young one in a cage out-
of-doors for about three weeks. During that time
a pair of old birds claimed him as their own ami
fed him through the bars. Although I witnessed
the feeding several times, I never once saw any
young birds or eggs included in the menu; but in
intervals in their self-made task the old jack and his
mate feasted right royally on the chickens in the
back yard, and on other young birds in the neighbor-
hood.
* .# * *k
“Colub”: A good deal has been heard about
the power of snakes to fascinate birds; but how aboiu
this? The other day a Casino (N.S.W.) farmer was
urged by his ten-year-old to “come and look at the big
black worm,” and on going to investigate lie found a
4ft. black snake busy hypnotising - a full-grown cat
which in any other circumstances would have been
more than a match for the wriggler. The latter was
stretched out full length, with puss about 3ft. away,
and both were absolutely motionless. The youngster
marched straight up to the pair and struck the snake
on the head with a light piece of stick without pro-
ducing the slightest movement from it. The farmer
then took a hand and lopped off the reptile’s head
with an axe. But when he went to pick up the cat
he found that it was apparently paralysed and utterly
unable to move its limbs. It was not until some
hours later that puss was right again. Prior to this
incident the cat was an indefatigable hunter and
seldom came near the house. Now his favorite posi-
tion is inside, as close as he can get to human beings,
and he can’t be driven outside.

About a top storey ;
“Nor-West”: If the tomtit’s peculiar habit of
building an extra room on top of its humpy is
aimed at fooling the bronze cuckoo the latter tumbled
to the joke a:ons ago. Like “Jim Carew” (B.
3/5/’23) I have examined hundreds of the nests, but
have never seen the birds in the top storey or found
a bronze cuckoo’s egg there, although I have found
many of the little brownish-green eggs of the cuckoo
in the lower living-room. William Gillies, how-
ever, in his book, “Nature Studies in Australia,”
mentions that he once found a bronze cuckoo’s egg
in the top nest while there were young tits in the
lower nest. Probably “bronzie” came late, and in
disgust laid in the top apartment. Another reason
put forward by bird observers besides those men-
tioned by “Jim Carew” is that the top storey pro-
BREAKING THE NEWS.
“What’s wrong with the old boy?”
“He’s just had a letter to say that his wife
is coming hack.”
“But I thought she had left him for good?”
“That’s what he thought, too.”
vides a resting-place for the young birds when they
have overgrown the limits of the lower nest and are
learning to fly.
“Sirdar”: 1 have repeatedly seen the henpecked
Mr. Tomtit in the top storey taking a spell from th«
domestic cares represented by a wife and a family
of five robust youngsters.
“Jack Campbell”: Near our house, in a low bushy
tree, a pair of tomtits have built their nests fof
years. They have always laid and hatched their eggs
in the top nest and reared them in the bottom one.
I’ve proved this by seeing a few dead featherless
birds in the top one and some chirping fellows in the
bottom nest. I’m only a kid, but I know.
REST-SEEKERS.
[FOR THE BU LLETIN.]
When the day’s glory ends
And the sun in splendor diessed
Like a drowsy king descends
To his curtained couch of rest,
Height and tree, tree and height,
’Neath the skies’ slumbrous glow,
In a lavishment' of light
Purple grow;
Purple grow, purple swim,
Rock and ridge, leaf and limb,
Ere the day gives ground to the dark o' night.
When the long shadows fall
At the going of the sun,
Through the trees, green and tall,
Come the cattle one by one —
Head to tail, tail to head,
In the skies’ slumbrous glow,
Black and dun, white and red,
Lowing low ;
Lowing low, lowing soft,
Flanks alieave, horns aloft,
In the young, green leaves and the grey grass dead.
When the long shadows steal
At the dying of the day.
And the twittering swallows wheel
At their merry evening play,
Loud and low, low and loud,
On the slow-moving breeze
Sing the feathered forest-crowd
From their trees;
From their trees, green and tall,
Singing one, singing all,
W r ith the purple dome above and one lone cloud.
When the soft lustre wanes
On the mountain and the tree,
Through the valleys and the plains
Glide the rivers to the sea ;
Strong and swift, swift and strong,
Through the land, dim and wide,
Stealing on with a song
To the tide;
To the tide far away
And the cliffs, grim and grey,
And the lone sea sands where the grey gulls throng.
When the rich purples dim
1 On the hilltop and the glen,
Tired of heart, tired of limb,
Come the weary, horning men ;
Gain and loss, loss and gain,
In the skies’ dimming glow,
But the one thought in their brain,
t As they go;
•' , As they go up and down
Through the long-streeted town,
Or the green, tossing trees where the cool winds blow.
When the world hides its head
’Neath the night’s sable cloak,
Home to love, home to bed,
Come the curly-headed folk;
Tired of tears, tired of joys,
In the soft arms of sleep,
Rosy-limbed girls and boys
Slumber deep ;
Slumber deep, slumber sweet,
Weary hands, weary feet,
While above them the breeze with the dim curtain
toys.
When the daylight has gone
And the land sinks to rest,
Marching on, marching on,
Go the stars to the west —
Star and star, star and star,
Through the dark, still and tense;
And their home-place is far,
Ages hence;
Ages hence, realms away,
They shall halt, dim and grey,
In the chill ghost-glooms where the dead worlds are.

LETTER

Powders
The ball on the Ceramic seut up the gay-
est bubble of a champagne week. Charity
was the excuse, and the Crown-street
Women’s Hospital the beneficiary. The big
liner lay at Miller’s Point; and the arrival
of the hundreds of limousines, with their be-
jewelled carnival upholstery, provided an even-
ing’s excitement for poor sister and brother
who possess that land. The amazing part was
that there was nothing at all of bitter-
ness in the devouring gaze of the young
mothers who watched the procession of furs
and gems. Probably because each felt the
youngster in her arms a potential Prime
Minister, or a film beauty.
The wharf and the goods-shed had been
turned into a fairy-like approach. “Roses all
the way” seemed to be Dalgety’s motto ; there
were pink roses—matronly, flapper and
baby—blinking along a pink lattice; and the
green of palms, and the gaiety of bunting.
Here was the stage on which the Posters
posed, made their how and slipped into the
grand procession—these manoeuvres under
the guiding hands of Captain Lawrence, Mrs.
Leslie Walford (who brought the newest
shade in petunia georgettes) and Mrs.
Charlie Jaques. After this came the joy of
the evening—the sight of the handsome
G.-G. couple prancing at the head of the
procession from the wharf on to the bril-
liantly-lighted boat; a small regiment of
blue-revered aides after them, and then in
a follow-my-leader fashion the three thou-
sand or so optimists who had bought tickets
with the intention of dancing. Mrs. Tony
Hordern, in a black frock with golden em-
broideries, a sable scarf and pearls, clapped
her hands exhorting the procession to “Keep
up with the band.” The pretty girleen who
put up an argument for Black and White
whisky got the loud hand of the evening.
For the rest, the costumes mostly advertised
face-powders and creams. But who cared?
The crush was as terrific as at the Artists’
Ball last year; partners were lost and
found, or purposely mislaid ; and every face
towards supper-tiihe wore rather the look
of the cat that has just licked the cream.
And it was as well the revellers got some
nourishment from within, for, apart from
the sheik-like atmosphere of the mysteri-
ously-lighted supper-tent, there was little to
be had by the man who was not a Clabby.
The sandwich-hunter was in such hordes
that iu sight of plenty many perished of
hunger.
One of the most beautiful frocks of the
night was worn by Mrs. Harry Carr. It
was of black velvet, beautifully cut, moored
to her arms by a lattice of near-diamonds.
The Governor-General’s lady wrapped a cloak
of gold brocade and fur about her jade-and-
silver frocking; the Waley dame shepherded
the debs; and Mrs. Norman Lowe, of Siam,
wore a scintillating glory of vellum and
metal tissue, heady with a beaded design in
pink and gold. And poor Mona Daley, the
hospital’s secretary, was wearing stitches
and sticking-plaster, in a narrow hospital
bed, owing to a motor accident the previous
night.
Lady Forster had a quiet Empire Day
celebration of her own at Admiralty House,
where she entertained the ex-service women.
Dispensing with all formality, the lady, as
the winter afternoon drew in, switched on
electrics, or closed a window that might he
carrying a draught. Mrs. Earp, who pro-
vided the music, made a good old French
“practice” of the occasion; and a newly-
arrived English girl named Stevenson added
to the cheerfulness of the programme. Then
there were tea, real coffee and pyramids
of wafer-like sandwiches and cream-filled
cakes.
The N. S. Wales Club got in early with
its Empire Day dinner—ate it the night be-
fore. But the death of Herbert Maitland
and Henry Gorman cast a gloom over the
evening. As a toast was drunk in silence many
a man present would have welcomed lowered
lights.
At the glittering Naval and Military Ball
there was gold braid a-plenty ; but here and
there a man clung tenaciously to his khaki,
and a lame foot or a maimed arm reminded
one that war, after all, is an ugly thing of
mud and blood and tears. An armed guard
that stood at attention kept an eye on the
battalion colors adorning the stage; and all
around the galleries battle honors flirted with
lifebuoys from the Australian fleet. At 10.30
the vice-regals arrived —all of them; the
G.-G. Forsters aud the State Exes. They
were marched into the hall under an escort
of Lancers, while the organ pealed “The
King” and the newly-cleaned candelabra
blinked more roguishly than usual. The two
vice-regal ladies almost rivalled them in pris-
matic splendor. Both were glittering with
diamonds. Lady Forster’s frock of satin
and tulle looked as though it had been
sprayed with blue moonlight, the result of
encrustments of blue sequins. Dame Mar-
garet trailed elegant ivory brocade; and
Chief Justice Cullen’s lady, who came with
the vice-regals, wore the fashionable velvet
in mouse-grey tones. The Waley knight
brought his lady, looking very handsome in
a gown of velvet that resembled a shaven
lawn; petunia velvet was the choice of
Neville Mayman’s wife; Mrs. Tony Hor-
dern was beaded in coral and grey; Storkey,
Y r .C., came with Mrs. Storkey; and the
Consul for China brought his wife in pale
pink silk. Of all the big roomful Moira
Brady, in pale lilac, and Mrs. Tom Rolin, in
soft grey velvet, were the belles of a party
of which every woman was a good-looker.
Thea Proctor’s show at the New Salon
drew a great throng of the Nearly Best.
George Lambert, very conscious of his slim
waistline and the flaming glory of his beard,
gave the little show a handsome push-off with
a dissertation on Art Influences, listened to
avidly by a crowd of well-dressed who love
to gnaw a quick lunch of culture before
“going on” to something else dizzily intellec-
tual. Thea, very handsome in a redingote
effect of black cloth, turned back with deep
revers of organdie, and one of the high-
crowned hats she affects, bade the comers
welcome with one hand while she clasped a
posy with the other.
The Very Best had been bidden to a pri-
vate show on the previous day, when a
scrumptious tea accompanied the art talk.
Here came bunches of men from the Society
of Artists. Ernest Watt drifted in to gaze
at the portrait of his wife in the frock she
wore to the Artists’ Ball last year. Knoxes
nibbled cheese straws; the Cat and the
Canary of the Criterion thriller came
along in perfect understanding; Mrs. Jimmie
Burns wore a garment in blue tones that
was more like a bead bag than anything else
on earth, heavily and thickly woven
in a startling horticultural design. Bea
McDonald and her mother lingered before
the fan design named “The Swing” ; Roy de
Mestre wandered around with a grey-tailored
Dangar girl; Thea’s tall cousin, Hora
Roberts, almost extinguished her good looks
under unbecoming millinery; and Mrs. “Yo
Merry” Kelly introduced friends to her por-
trait.
Herbert Maitland, who died last week at
his beautiful Macquarie-street home, excelled
in many branches of surgery, hut his greatest
w ork was
done in neck •
cases. His
method of
cleaning out
a deep-seated
cancer in this
region was
classical.
When the war
came he saw
men of his
calibre being
allotted to
measles cases
and the like
in Egypt, and
decided that
he could do
more for the
Diggers at
home. At
Randwick he
concentrated
on faee-muti-
lations, and produced some marvellous results,
building new noses and chins for men whose
wounds had dehumanised them, so far as
appearance went. Above everything, he was
a great doctor, healer, eneourager. As this
photo by Freeman suggests, he radi-
ated strength, courage and optimism, and
the dreariest ward was brighter after he
had passed through it. The Australian Club,
of which he was one of the oldest members,
will greatly miss his strong, smiling face and
his powerful athlete’s figure.
Macquarie-street lowered its bliuds for the
surgeon’s last passing that way. The tall,
white slice of a house, which was at once
his charming home and his workshop, looked
a stricken thing in the grey winter’s morn-
ing. His own car followed the hearse, empty
save for its driver. Sixteen limousines were
packed with sisters and pros, of Jenner
Hospital, who made a striking note in their
pink-and-white uniforms. (Pink was the
doctor’s favorite color, and in the heaped-
up masses of flowers it predominated.)
Ilis patients in Sydney Hospital in a condi-
tion to do so asked to be wheeled out. and
nodded a last good-bye from the balconies.
Melbourne’s Walter Kirby unwound ban-
nerettes of tenor song last week in Sydney
Town Hall. It was the first public recital
he had given this side of the change of gauge;
judging by the enthusiasm of the house, it
won’t be the last. He has an easy way with
him, and doesn’t overact when pouring out
an operatic aria. In addition he had the
advantage of a hall all dressed up for the
Army and Navy Ball: the electrics were
softly swathed, and were mellowly kind to
singer and audience alike. The programme
was as various as the stock of a Goulburn-
street store, aud Vern Barnett supplied
the accompaniments to all. Walter’s final stroll
on to the stage occurred when the pianist
was striking up for the second verse of “God
Save.” Just happening along, as it were,
the singer took up the notes, and carried the
anthem to its climax in a flood of silvery
radiance.
The Cavalier was the scene of a farewell
party to singer Renee Maxwell. The gifted
girl sings her
good - bye t o
Sydney in the
Town Hall on
Saturday next,
once more
faces Europe
and study, and
then turns to
New Yor k.
Nearly 70 ad-
mirers throng-
ed the room,
among them
Dame Mary
Hughes and
Earle Page’s
wife; and
there was a
hillock of
complimentary
bouquets, in-
cluding the
hackneyed lad-
der of fame,
which, mounting on the table before her,
threatened to hide Renee’s face from the
multitude. Renee’s adviser and accompanist,
Natalie Rosenwax, told the tea-drinkers of
three other voices she hoped to introduce to
Europe soon.
Here it might be as well to insert the
note of warning uttered a while ago by Lute
Drummond and now 7 repeated in these words
by Rosa Alba, from Kennington Bark-road :
“First, money is all important. I estimate
that for an unknown singer it costs £3OOO to
get a footing. It will take half that to get
the real training; the balance to get an intro-
duction. To run a recital on the simplest
lines, with no guarantee of any notice from
the Press, costs £100; the Queen’s Hall runs
into £3OO, the Albert Hall to £5OO. A
famous conductor told me it was sheer folly
for a singer to expect to ‘get in’ under five
years; and for one with £2OO only a few
lessons alone can be taken. Miss Berkeley,
of Melbourne, chosen by Melba for the Nellie
Rowe scholarship, arrived, had five lessons
with Miss Rowe, left and went to Paris to
study. Those are bare facts. Myrtle Thorne
is studying with Sir Henry J. Wood. Miss
Coleson is with Miss Rowe. The promise of
great singers to give support may be good
publicity, but ! London is overcrowded
with vocalists, and more money is to be
made in Australia. Rank-and-filers, beware
the bad adviser!” For herself Alba is not
doing badly. She is studying with Sir Henry
Wood and Alan Gill. She lias been intro-
duced to England and the Continent by two
nights’ “broadcasting” from Marconi House.
There’s a chance of her getting a leading part
in “The Little Duchess” by Australian
George Clutsam.
The French Alliance had its second blos-
soming last week at the old address of St.
James’s. Mrs. Vivers, who w r as booked as
one of the hostesses, was away, nursing the
prevailing cold, so the heavy job fell to the
lot of Mrs. Bertie Kelly and Mrs. Frederick
Learoyd. (But what would the indomitable
Miss Soubeiran have thought of any but a
Frenchwoman receiving at a French party!)
The evening was divided by a supper in the
basement: the first half was given over to
song and dance ; the second managed without
the song. A small girl. Edna Saunderson,
portrayed St. Saens “Swan” in fluttering
toe-action, and it is to her credit that she
left the old bird a graceful feather or two
to float with —many older legs pluck him
altogether. The plumply good-looking Girlie
Toohey gathered a truck-load of scented offer-
ings for a group of chansonettes which
but for a vivid aid given by her
shoulders might not have been wholly
intelligible to baek-seaters. Belgian Consul
Segaert (with whom came pink-clad daugh-
ter Henriette) and a fellow-conspirator
snatched victory from the jaws of defeat by
inserting an impromptu oration in the place
of some *young man who bad inconsiderately
fallen ili after the programmes had been
printed. Besides the usual Allianeers were
one group of visitors from Noumea and an-
other from Japan, and a newly-returned
Worrall girl wrapped herself like a Spanish
dancer in a gold-embroidered silk shawl that
seemed like mellowed light from her Titian
locks.
There was a loud skirl o’ the pipes around
Elizabeth-street midway through last week
when the descendants of Roderick and Moun-
tain Dew foregathered for a real Highland-
ers’ ball. The Australian Hall blinked at
the glory of the tartans; there was a tang
of gorse and heather about the night that
bubbled to beaded delight when the pipe band
flew into action to show what a shoddy
affair was this concoction we call jazz. Dame
Margaret brought Sir Walter to the revels,
but his kilts had got moth-eaten during
their long residence in Newfoundland, so his
Ex. had to be content to be merely trousered.
"There was a sound of revelry by night,
and day, too, towards the week-end, when
Fort-street School held a fete to raise money
for a war memorial. All the usual stalls
went profiteering, and visitors were almost
tearfully exhorted to “Come and hear the
wireless concert —you may never have an-
other chance.” It is expected that between
£5OO and £OOO will be made available.
An institution which stands as a memorial
to the late J. D. Fitzgerald, who did a lot
more useful work than has been advertised,
has just achieved a larger growth. This is
the Anti-Tubercular Dispensary in Park and
Hay streets, Sydney, which is run by the
National Assoc, for the Prevention of Con-
sumption. Fitzgerald, finding he could not
do all he desired to combat the “white
plague,” helped to found the association in
1912. It has now started a branch in Bal-
main ; and an appeal for funds has gone out
to give it a good send-off.
Henry Gorman, who went west the other
day, aged 74, showed a gallant politeness be-
fore the final collapse. He had undergone
an operation for appendicitis which, owing
to his years and condition, could not be miti-
gated by the usual merciful anaesthetic —only
a “local” could be applied. After the ordeal
the old man looked at the doctors, and said
with fine courtesy: “Thank you, gentlemen.”
For over a quarter of a century he had been
chairman of Sydney Telegraph.
Josie Melville was one of the mourners over
the death of Phyllis Porter, the fine-looking
girl of the “Peep Show” co., who died of burns
in Wellington (M.L.). Those two, with two
others who have, left the theatre, were girls
together at Albion-street School. The quar-
tette went to Minnie Hoopers dancing classes
together, and joined “The Firm” in a bunch.
Phyllis Porter sang the “Anzac” song in the
children’s pantomime of 1917.
Among the successful candidates at the
recent A.T.N.A. examination was Daphne
Page, a sister of Dr. Earle Page, the Federal
Treasurer. She trained at Prince Alfred,
where so many Digger patients still go.
After all, the Scott Fletchers may revoke
their intention of going to England. He
lias, anyhow, a temporary job that he likes
in Brisbane, and mother and daughter Ida
have followed in the steps of the learned
head, who used to be chief of Wesley College
in the Shadow of Sydney Uni. There were
numerous farewell parties—some of them
had to be set back to allow an attack of
mumps to have its way.
Louise Mack gave a surprise coo-ee to the
family the other day. She arrived, un-
announced from Maoriland, where she has
been living for the past year or so. The
same afternoon she breezed off north. Next
day same the inevitable telegram: “Luggage
gone astray; please send a bunch of glad
rags.”
Maorilander Dorothy Gard’ner, the elocu-
tionist, has pegged out a claim in Johannes-
burg. She has been all over England since
Sydney knew her last, but South Africa lias
got its claw in her, and the gifted lass is
making no end of money doing the teaching
work in Johannesburg that her father did
so artistically for half-a-lifetime in Dunedin.
A Brisbane postscript:—
His Ex. shed his light upon the annual meeting of
the Braille Society. Mrs. Cran topped the list for the
number of braille books transcribed in the year, aixl
Drs. Gibson and Marks, both eye-men, spoke sensibly,
with a sly dig at the ladies for successfully running-
the whole of the society’s business for the year and
then calling on the males when talking had to le
done. Tea was sipped amid decorations of scarlet
poinsettia and yellow blossoms.
The same evening Sir Matt, suggested that Music
had achieved more solid patronage in Bananaland than
either Art or Literature. The remark was made inci-
dentally while handing out the London College of
Music medals, diplomas and prizes for last year in the
Albert Hall.
At Government House the other night his Ex. fed
Sir William Windham, Col. Hurley, British Trade-
Commissioner McCregor, the Tullys and Miss Gladys
Pott, with a sprinkling of the Anglican Church and
the Mayor of Brisbane.
Nina Luxmoore married Frank Gallagher, of Kedron,
in a becoming mixture of silk cashmere, georgette
and hand-made flowers. A pink-and-white tulle train,
white roses and a chaplet of silver on a tulle veil
completed the picture which the proud father, Capt.
Luxmoore, handed over to the bridegroom. Lennon's
Hotel was full of rosqs for the reception.
Brisbane rolled up the other night to hear T. J.
McMahon speak his ppece about the Orient, illustrated
with lantern slides. / The Club dining-room was filled
with many chairs, 'yet no seat yawned in emptiness.
Lena Hammond, Gladys Frost, and singer Wishart
carolled and played between whiles.
South Brisbane (lid itself proud this week with roses
and gerberas, afterioon tea and a string band to cheer
the souls of the delegates of the Chamber of Com-
merce. The Mayor- and Mayoress hostessed the 200
guests.

Phones Cantrel 1532, 1533,
Melbourne stood the shock of the invasion
of the Premiers and their womenfolk with
what equanimity it could muster. Theodore
was accompanied by a well-built wife, and
the Queensland twain are sadly reminiscent
of big T. J. Ryan and /its guod-kuking
spouse. Tasmania’s feminine contingent in-
cludes the wife of Premier Hayes, who is
staying with the Dawborns, of the National
Bank, and Mrs. D’Arcy Addison, who used
to be old John Downer’s lady.
Mrs. Stanley Bruce mildly cheered the
feminine halves of the State heads with
an afternoon of tea and talk at her South
Yarra place on Thursday, the political ele-
ment being toned up with a bunch of
Toorak’s best-chiffoned. Mrs. Stanley how-
d’ye-dooed in rich silk with side washes of
fringe, and jet buckles at the equator. An
ermine stole was athwart her shoulders and
her winning smile illumined the shadow of
a beplumed hat-brim. But why behatted
and wrapped at your own party, like a Lon-
don “season” hostess, who thereby signals to
her guests that she is just off to catch the
tail-end of another rout? The politicians’
ladies were all smartly tailored in subdued
colorings. Mrs. Oakes had livened her black
with skunk furs. The Barwell dame and
Premier Theodore’s spouse were coat-frocked
in navy, the latter’s rig being gladdened with
braid and bead and an ostrich-laden hat.
Mrs. Hayes flew Russian braided effects on
her mole cloth and ribbon on her toque.
The William Leonard, Herbert Power,
Donald Mackinnon, Harry Payne, Byron
Moore and Russell Clarke matrons headed
the list of Toorak’s extra-specials, with Mrs.
Alec Russell, whose squatter husband has
been chosen as Bruce’s confidential sec. for
the Empire Conference trip—if it material-
ises.
The marriage of Col. Wanliss and Muriel
Bryant at South Yarra Christ Church last
week was a subdued affair of the relatives-
only kind, and there was neither bridesmaid
nor best man. Dr. Molyneux, an old friend
of the late Dr. Bryant, drifted in from the
Cold Country a few days previously, and he
convoyed the bride to the altar. She was in
white lace with a blue feather fluttering from
a white picture hat which smothered all but
the ear-pads of her auburn thatch. Her
vows were breathed over a mass of del
phiniums. The elder Bryant sister, Mrs.
Clarence Sides, had come down from Hay to
hostess the cake-cutting at Menzies’. The
newly-weds will run in to this city again
for a final pow-wow with their intimates
before they leave for New Guinea, where the
Colonel is Justice-in-Chief.
Another Western Districter is leaving his
native gum-trees to add social tone to Aus-
tralia’s representatives overseas. lan Black,
of the Terang wool-growing clan, has been
given the job of official sec. to the Donald
Mackinnon American mission. Evidently the
only Donald thinks it is time Uncle Sam
learned that his countrymen don’t all saunter,
round in red shirts casually cracking stock-
whips. If lan’s silk socks don’t make that
clear nothing will.
The Victoria League, which had the visit
ing Lady Stanley as its leader in the days
of her vice-regal splendor, hired the No. " 9
Darling-street reception parlors on Friday
afternoon to farewell her with pekoe anti
cream-puffs, reinforced by a warm inter-
change of verbal posies. It was a frightfully
swish affair, of course—these League things
always are. Miss Madden, sister of the
late S’John and Frank, as president, colla-
borated with MrS. Harry Emmerton and
Mrs, Alec Leeper to receive the star guest.
She wore her usual agreeable smile, fur coat-
ings over brown-tailored effects, and a dinky
little toque of many colors. The John Grices’
elder daughter Elsa was there in her new
capacity of hon. sec., having succeeded to
the pen laid down by Mrs. Cave.
The weather provided the only excuse for
a gftimble when Brig.-General Grimwade
handed daughter Gwenda over to Chester
Manifold at the Frankston Anglican Church.
The bride walked gracefully in white satin
under the enveloping tulle which was
anchored with orange flowers on silver rib-
bon. The bridegroom had the support of
brother-in-law Thornton Grimwade gnd a
Manifold cousin, R. Fyffe Jamieson. It was
a very cousinly happening, for two of the
bride’s cousins, Katherine Thornton and
little Helena Teece, ’maided with the assist-
ance of a Clunes girl, Betty Nicholl, and the
’groom’s tiny cousin Patricia Rutledge. All
four fluttered early-Victorianly in white lace
hooped at the hips and banded with daisies,
the.r heads chastely crowned with margue-
rites to match their little hand pos.es. Quite
a feudal touch was imparted by a group of
white-clad school-children who fined up out-
side the church and lustily chorused “The
Bells of St. Mary’s” as they flapped flowery
ti-tree wands. The cake was cut in the ball
parlor of the Grimwades’ seaside homestead,
Marathon, where the walls were elaborately
hedged round with evergreens and daisies
under a frieze of white tulle, punctuated with
more flowers.
Owing to the comparatively recent death
of the bridegroom’s father, the gathering was
mostly in the family Mrs. Grimwade was
marocained in fur-hemmed grey under a vel-
vet wrap, and fluffy feathers dripped from
the hinder ledge of her hat brim. The
’groom’s mother muffled her black dressings
in furs and wore a black ostrich-plumed
toque. Mrs. Priminister Bruce, who is a
Manifold cousin, shed the light of her new
official importance in brown embroidered
tailorings faintly splashed with gold. Coated
and hooded in grey, demure as a wainscot
mouse, the bride went off with her man for
the first chapter of the honeymoon at Mount
Macedon. Chapter 11. happens at Honolulu.
Dress-fanciers had a great night with
Diana Wilson at the King’s on Saturday. On
the deck of the good ship Angostura she was
a sportive vision in red and white, changing
into an Egyptian Tutankimona when the
bugle mentioned dinner. The frock, of black
and flesh-pink, nestled to her undulations,
but left one shapely shoulder crying for
shelter. When quarantined and l.stening
devoutly to a Dago guitarist, the actress
thought fit for the occasion another cling-
some gown of black, closely buttoned down
the front and carrying a heavy wake with a
golden undertow. The gelatined sunshine out
of doors in the th’rd act was sufficient excuse
for an ultra-modish eruption whereof the
most devastating particulars were a trans-
parent flowered overskirt, a necklet of black
lace that stuck out like the hair on a Japan-
ese doll, and a yellow cutaway coat that
seemed also privy to the mysteries of the
Diana form divine. Feminine eyeballs goggled
as these apparitions glode by. Certainly
Miss Wilson made the best-dressed in the
audience look like fragments of a remnant
sale. And there were many in the house
who represented _ the ravage of numerous
cheque-books. Down in the front stalls
Leslie Holland, accompanied by Ethel Morri-
son, was vociferously recognised by the gods;
so was Doris Kendall, who sat a couple of
rows behind. Among others conspicuously
present were Julius Knight and Lesley Mad-
den that was, with her hair parted in the
middle and a young pink cabbage postured
over each ear.
This is Mary Wilkinson, whose three-act
comedy, “The Whirlpool,” was lately served
up at the Playhouse by the Mermaids, who
had previously staged her one-acter, “The
Lighthouse Keeper’s Wife”—stronger stuff
than her more
ambitious
effo r t. She
rightfully be-
longs to Gee-
long, and
writes plays
only as a
hobby, her
real job in life
at present be-
ing secretary
to Dalgety’s
m anagerial
head, George
Aitken. The
versatile
young lady
pleads guilty
to having
launched a
volume of
verse, and her
poetic fancy
has also found
a vent in a four-act poem-drama, “The Quest,”
which was read at the April meeting of the
Arts and Literature Society. Gregan
McMahon recognised Miss Wilkinson’s play-
writing possibilities in 1916 when he put
on her four-acter, “Whither?” at one reper-
tory show, produced by himself in Mel-
bourne. Rembrandt is responsible for the
laughing picture of the lass.
Prime Minister Bruce looked very bored
at times at the Premiers’ Conference. He
wasn’t a bit, happy. His proposals were
being mauled about, he had had a row with
the Soldiers’ Association (they had accused
his Government of insincerity regarding pre-
ference to Diggers), and then there was the
doubt raised about his trip to Blighty owing
to the exit of Bonar Law and the entrance
of Stanley Baldwin. The last-named was
probably a “home” worry as well as an “ex-
ternal” one. How some of the old-time Vic-
torian Parliamentarians would have glared
could they have come back for an hour to
their old House—the Reps, chamber in which
the conference was held —and watched the
spirals of smoke from pipe, cigar and cigar-
ette ! Bruce’s little contribution was from
a fag.
The Simeon Nathans’ daughter Stella was
matrimonially clamped to an Indian Army
captain, David Tultis Dunn, by vicar Law
at Toorak St. John’s the other evening. The
leading lady was resplendent in white and
gold brocade, her hair roofed in with a cap of
seed pearls under her tulle veil. Miss M.
Bain, a niece of the bride, and Miss Maybery
Bevan bridesmaided in early-Victorian frocks
of pink taffetas, with lace round the collar-
bone end and black velvet hats dashed with
pink. Captain de Hautpick and Roy Nathan
stood guard over the bridegroom. Later on
a few friends drank the healths at Menzies’,
where the bride’s parents held the usual re-
ception.
This is a Rembrandt photo of Dr. James
Rudall, the Collins-street eye-specialist, who
knows nearly as much about music as he does
about iritis and the like. Verbrugghen de-
scribed him as
the best Cur
Anglais per-
former and
one of the best
oboe - players
in this coun-
try. Since the
days of Mar-
shall Hall ho
has tootled
soulfully and
honorarily in
all our big
orchestral pro-
ductions. He
inherited both
his medical
and musical
talent fro m
his fath e r,
who was also
an eye-expert
and one of the
finest flautists
in this State.
The whole family were trained in a home
orchestra, and one brother, Charles, who died
some years back, could have earned an easy
living had he cared to turn the sonorous
noises of the bassoon to professional account.
The floor of the chief Albert-street Artists’
Gallery was as tightly packed with humans
as were the walls with gift paintings on
Friday afternoon. Lady Forbes Robertson,
wearing the honey-sweet smile which is prac-
tically a fixture, arrived under convoy of
Austin Bastowe to speak the opening words.
She had guarded against the cold with fur,
and flew a nodding plume from her small
black hat, while two gay little presentation
posies lightened the darkness of her outfit.
The Dancey memorial committee hopes to
have netted £6OO or more for the widow
when the money is counted up.
The Palace Theatre is at last free from
the renovators; and Hugh YVard doubled the
delirious attractions of the first night of
“The Faithful Heart”' on Saturday with its
official opening as the pretty Princess’s twin
sister in comiort and beauty The act was
a dumb sliow, so to speak. Nobody said
miffin’. But acting-vice-royalty smiled
appreciation from the front row of the circle
over a flowery hedge of presentation trophies.
The visiting State political big guns were
boxed in the little Juliet balconies which
have replaced the former ugly pens, and the
rest of the house was packed with the very
nicest crowd. The one inharmonious note
was raised by an infant in the dress-circle,
but the Bolshevistic youngster was promptly
counted out before Mulcaster or Sylvia Shaw
could mistake its squeak for “the bird.” The
Stanley Bruces failed to materialise as
advertised ; but Earle Page stepped into the
breach. Jennie Brenan, a vision in grey,
perched with her mother in Hugh Ward’s
pen, where they were buttressed with flowers.
The sartorial honors of the play go to the
men. One could hear the flappers chortle
at the khakied tailorings in the War Office
annexe scene. Hugh Ward knew he could
get the gallery girl just so if he was careful
to supply a bunch of alluring heroes. Eve
Gray, whose beauty was tucked out of sight
under a black wig, got no chance to hit the
eye. Her frocks are a bit of grey silkiness
with white cuffs and collar, and a rather less
unattractive grey homespun and travelling
cap. Sylvia Shaw has two shrieks—one a
captivating grey tailor-made, with saxe blue
revers on the short coatee and a band of blue
running down one side of the skirt; the
second a vampish affair of rose-pink geor-
gette, with overskirt of gold and rose bro-
cade, backed by a left wing of the georgette.
A cloak of the latter material veiled in
ribbon-decked brown with a furry collar
effect covered her coming and going.
Our electric trains are pushing out. They
now run through from Ivew to Fawkner.
Like the path of glory, each way leads to
the grave. There is a cemetery at both ends.
Lieut.-Gov. Irvine told a dinner-party the
other day that he and Donald Mackinnon
were unemployed barristers in adjoining
chambers many years ago, and palled up
while discussing the vague possibility of some
solicitor being misguided enough to send
briefs to them. Both rose to be Attorney-
General. and Irvine went higher still. In
his reminiscing the C.J. didn’t mention that
when lawyers did look their way it was he
and not Mackinnon who got the fees. But,
well-endowed with broad acres, Mackinnon
didn't worry.
The Donald Mackinnons’ younger chick.
Marie, who has packed her little slippers to
go to Washington with mum and dad, has
been having her voice toned up at the Albert-
street Con. She was farewelled a few days
ago at Buckley’s tea-rooms by a group of
s.ster students headed by Jean Hambledon
and Dulcie Cherry. The Con. girls all vote
Marie a real good sport—which means that
she isn’t burdened with too many social frills.
The Lady Northcote Free Kindergarten at
Montague, one of the city’s poorest districts,
is to he given a sorely-needed financial lift
by a group of our best matrons—Mesdames
W'alter Bayles, Norton Grimwade, Goulburn
Brooke and R. M. Turner, who, with Miss
Bullivant, are conspiring to stage a bridge
evening for the cause in the ball parlor of
Woongoleen, Mrs. Bayles’s Toorak place, on
July 7. Card-playing enthusiasts are invited to
double the delights of spending a pleasant
evening and helping the poor little ones by
booking tables at a pound apiece. Mrs.
Turner, of Tallarook, Walsh-street, South
Yarra, is the lion. sec.
There is to be a public dedication of the
monument to John Batman, founder of Mel-
bourne, which the City Council has raised
in Batman-avenue, on the north bank of the
Yarra. By putting up this obelisk the cor-
poration has quieted the stirrings of con-
science which occurred over the. shifting of
the bones of Batman along with those of
other pioneers from the West Melbourne ceme-
tery to the necropolis at Fawkner.
A coo-ee from Adelaide:—
Gold and blue and khaki fi.led the Town Hall fer
the Gill Guide F£te—a two-days’ affair organised
by Lady Bridges and the Moulden dame, who is the
Guides’ Chief Commissioner in this State. His Ex.
declared the show open, and on the platform wia
Miss Margaret Prior, fresh from English headquarters
and an organising tour in America, who has come
to help get the movement on its feet here. Lady
Bridges ran the work stall, with the Arthur Water-
house, Lowe, Harry Nott, Fred Porter, Cecil Fisher
and Dudley Turner matrons among her helpers. The
Guide roll has mounted to 700, and between them
they gave demonstrations of everything, from child-
nursing, needlcoraft and cooking, to signalling and
country dancing.
The Methodist conscience, which has been holding
its annual conference, allowed itself some lighter
moments. Miss E. M. Colton hostessed a garden-
party at Mount Lofty, and some of the greater dig-
nitaries have lunched with the Bridges at Govern-
ment House. To the garden-party all the conference
and its feminine belongirgs were bidden. Amateur
waitresses —members of the Methody Ladies’ Old
Collegians’ Assoc. —were on duty in the big tea-tent.
Merle Robertson proved herself composer as well
as pianist at her Town Hall recital, and the Adel-
aide Glee Club backed her up. Herbert King sang
three short songs by the Adelaide girl, and she her-
self played a Viennese waltz of her own that is dedi-
cated to Lady Bridges, and another bracket of half-
a-dozen original numbers. Flowers and applause were
showered upon her by an audience that included
Lady Bridges.
The feminine inter-’Varsity tennis tourney left
Melbourne the victors, with our own team thirl.
Play was too strenuous during the week for any social
interludes, but on the Saturday there was some motor-
ing and a lunch or two, with feminine students ds
hostesses.
The Wattle Day League leavened its annual meet-
ing with coffee, buns and music at the Arcadia Cafe.
President W. J. Sowden put in a word in support
of the recommendation from the Wattle Day Federal
conference that an Australian decoration, say, the
Order of the Wattle, should be established —a pro-
posal that is backed by the A.N.A. Seeing that the
wattle has a penchant for looking exactly like three
golden balls as soon as it is conventionalised, it
should make a peculiarly appropriate Order for
Australia.
The Bridges, with Ministe/-of-Education Pascoe as
their showman, turned up to the private view of
the School of Arts Exhibition —a big display, includ-
ing some really good work, for which Principal L. 11.
Howie might hand himself a nosegay. The exhibi-
tion, by the way, put up a new record for itself by
its sales on the opening day.
The engagement is announced of Gwynnyth Fay,
one of the Ernest Goods’ attractive twins, to Keith,
youngest son of the C. H. Angases.
The governing bodies interested in the seashore near
Adelaide have got together to push the scheme, origi-
nated in 1917, for an esplanade from the Outer Har-
bor, at the mouth of the Port River, to where the
coast becomes rocky at Brighton. Six districts are
interested, and all agree that it ought to be a Govern-
ment job. The old “Military-road” carefully ran just
behind the sandhills, to let troops and guns creep
from one fort to another out of the sight of Russian
cruisers, which were the bogey-men of that period ; and
it has fallen into disrepair, anyhow. What is wanted is
a drive with a sea view, such as already exists for a
mile or so between Largs and Semaphore. The dis-
tance is over 17 miles, and the estimated cost
£200,000.
Like all of their tribe, our Uni. examiners get in-
formation that they never found in their textbooks.
In a recent public exam, a question was asked about
jute. One candidate chanced this: “A jute is a roam-
ing beast that lives in the Alps. It lives on grass,
birds and leaves. These beasts are a menace to the
grape-vines that grow on the sunny side of the Alps.
They eat the main stem of the vine, and many half-
ripe bunches fall off. This is why wine tastes bitter.”

Until Essendon are defeated Vic. League
followers will crowd to see them play. On Saturday
30,000 repaired to the Carlton Oval "for the purpose.
Both Carlton and ’Don boast a few midgets balanced
by leviathans, and the latter spared neither them-
selves nor others. Consequently, half-a-dozen are now
receiving medical attention. Otherwise the game was
in no way entertaining: the ’Dons had the better of
it throughout, and scored 103 points to Carlton’s 65.
Richmond, minus its star forward, Bayliss, went
under to Saints by 56 to St. K.’s 61; and Melbourne
ran over South in the last quarter and won by S 4
points to 49. ’Wood and Geelong provided a fast,
open and pretty game up to half-time; in the third
quarter the Magpies took charge and doubled their
score, adding 51 points to Geelong’s 0. After that
only bigoted barrackers took further interest in the
matter, and when the rout ended ’Wood owned 119
points to Geelong’s 72.
“Tren”: No penalties were exacted for
the Riehmond-Carlton match—one of the roughest on
record. Turnbull, of the Tigers, was reported for
punching, but the recipient was “the most surprised
man in the world” when told he had been hit, so 10
action was taken. Martin’s (O.) broken arm could
not be charged to any individual, nor could Farrow’s
(C.) concussion. Few of the spectators missed the
knock that rendered Minogue (R.) useless as a cap-
tain and a player, or the swing that broke Bayliss’s
(R.) nose and put him off his game at a critical
moment. Bayliss is one of those who regularly col-
lect punches early in a match, the idea being to render
the collectors, innocuous. The cowardly trick of
violently grassing an opponent who had paused to
take his kick after marking the ball was a special
feature of this game, and elbows were freely used
throughout. The inability or unwillingness of um-
pires to notice and report glaring breaches, and the
fact that the player struck or assaulted will never
give truthful evidence when a case is reported, proves
that the present system has broken down. The only
argument against stewards stationed among the spec-
tators is t.hat of extra expense, but to save the game
from degeneration the sacrifice should be made.
A N.S.W. League delegation visited Mel-
bourne last week-end, chiefly to see how the code
was catching on financially. In the second series of
matches on Saturday St. Kilda and Ilinemoas (a team
of Maorilanders) played a draw (2 all). Air Force
walloped Melbourne by 10 (2 tries 2 goals) to 3
(a try). Moss, for the birdmen, notched a try and
a field-goal drop-kick from half-way—a feat which
is above the capabilities of 99 per cent, of N.S.W.
Lcagueites.

Balmain v. Newtown at Sydney Sports
Ground last Saturday was a ragged affair. The
only decent slab of combined effort by either set of
backs culminated in Dudley Seddon crossing in for
the Blues within a few minutes of the start. Day,
Newt.’s Goulburn custodian, added the extras. The
tackling of both teams was characteristically solid.
The Dockers’ new full back, Coonan (the third to
date) proved a failure, and was later replaced by
Willie Craig. Balmain’s rearguard, although well
supplied with the ball by Harold Watt and Schultz
could do nothing right. Fraser simply ran a wav-
iron i Robinson, his support, when in possession.
However, per medium of Clamback, Newt.’s rueker,
who was never on side, ’Main’s saw n-off goaler,
Mick Russell, hoisted two penalties, and the tally
at lemons was 5 to 4 in the Blues’ favor. ’Mains
were unlucky after the spell, when Robinson beat
the field and cross-kicked for A. Fraser to run in,
onlv to be recalled. The Blues were knocking hard,
Mick Russell, anxious to smother Kell, the Newt,
half, dived round the pack “offside,’’ and Day
again raised the bunting. Newts. 7, ’Mains, 4. It
seemed all over bar the shouting, when the Dockers
were awarded a penalty at midfield. Fraser short
punted, and from a scrum on the Blue line little
Georgie Robinson dived over and made the tally 7
all. The best back on the grass was Kell, the Newt,
half. 'J'he ruckers of both teams played hard rugger.
Schultz was ’Main’s best, and Felix Ryan, Newt.’s
stout skipper, was always to the fore. In the other
games St. George outed a depleted Glebe XIII by
17 to 7 (the infant team’s first win), and Easts
went down to Wests by 19 to 14. Norths (Pre-
miers), having the bye, visited Coalopolis and won
by 49 to 26. Norths and Souths —so far undefeated
—head the competition list.

Sydney ’Varsity XV started auspiciously
against the Maoriland students on Saturday, and had
amassed 18 points to 3 at half-time. However, with
the change-over and the benefit of the breeze, the
Blacks rose to their best form, and by means of
close, hustling tactics and clean passing, fairly
trampled the Sydneyites to the earth. In this ses-
sion they scored 23 points to the opposition’s nil,
the final score being M.L., 26 ; N.S.W., 18. D. Hart
is a fine type of forward, who should be worth a place
in any M.L. rep. team. He excelled in line-out play
and passing. E. H. Diack kicked four goals—one
a fine drop. Nothling (left winger) scored three
of Sydney’s tries, and Stanley (centre) and Doyle
and Erby (forwards) did well.

Dick Arnold, some time Clerk of N. S.
Wales Assembly, who died at Bowral (N.S.W.) last
week, aged 76, was captain of the crack Sydney Rug-
ger club (the Wallaroos), which thrived before most
of the present-day players were in trousers. He was
also a fine walker and sprinter.
“0.R.”: “Leagueite’s” statement that the
real father of Rugby football was a schoolboy named
Ellis, who, a hundred years ago, broke all precedent
by picking up the ball in the Rugby close and
running with it, is probably true enough. Certainly
it was current 40 years ago when I was at Rugby,
and I can remember hearing it from one Bloxam,
an octogenarian authority on all matters connected
with the school, who either witnessed the history-
making feat himself or was close handy when it
occurred. The only thing that is news to me is
that it happened in August, in the height of the
English summer, but if the commemorative tablet
(which wasn’t in existence in my time) says so, so
be it. It is rather curious that in the same issue
Rugby School, as a footbail nursery, gets a further
mention from “Tren,” who relates that T. W.
WMs, an Australian who had been captain of the
school in the early ’fifties, and returned to Melbourne
in 1866, invented the Australian (or Victorian)
game “thinking Rugby too rough for the working
classes.” It isn’t easy to feature any Rugby
enthusiast inventing another football code that sets
so many elemental Rugby rules (notably the off-
side one) at fiat defiance as the Victorian game does;
but, if Wills was responsible, isn’t it more likely
that the hardness of Australian playing-grounds in
those days had more to do with his experiment than
distrust in the restraint or solicitude for the limbs
of the hardy toiler?
This is G. Camp-
bell, captain of the
visiting Maoriland
Soccer XI. He is one
of the headiest outside
lefts playirg this game
out of Britain. Last
year he play'ed in all
three tests against the
Australian team in
M.L., and gave the
defence a torrid time.
When not international-
ising he shoots goals
for Wellington Pro-
vince.
lii Sydney on
Saturday, Maoriland
met N.S.W. in the
presence of 12,000 Soc-
cer enthusiasts. G.
Cartwright, who goal-
kept for N.S.W., had
plenty to do, and so
had T. Oliver (back).
Maoriland’s headwork
was pretty. G. Camp-
bell (Wellington), J.
Kissock (a 14st. centre-
half) and C. Daere
(Auckland), who is
also a rep. cricketer —
were the stars of the
visiting XI. Dacre got
both the M.L. goals:
he headed the first and
netted the second from
a smart pass by H.
Balk. N.S.W.’s first score came early—a fine
cross-ki< k by L. Burke (outside right): the
second was a penalty affair a minute before “time.”
M.L. were unlucky not to win. They combined well,
and were around the N.S.W. goal most of the time,
but they fouled a lot. There was a deal of
trouble owing to the different interpretations put on
the rules by the Maoriland and Sydney players.
At Sydney Stadium on Saturday night
Sid Godfrey’s famous right gained him a knock-out
win from Archie Bradley, of Queensland, just 20
seconds before the end of the last round. Had the
Leichhardt publican not been given the chance to
use one of the most lethal punches a lightweight lias
ever owned in Australia, the decision might have
been a draw'. Bradley, who, at 9.12, was a couple of
pounds heavier than his opponent, began in ravaging
style, and for the first five rounds crowded Godfrey
all over the ring. He kept up a tireless bombard-
ment of the Sydneyite’s ribs, and continued it even
when the latter began to bring a long left into
effective play. At intervals Godfrey complained to
the referee that he was being misused, but got no
satisfaction. Bradley was asking for trouble bv
his reckless methods, and in round 12 he found it in
the shape of a crashing right to the jaw, followed
by a left hook. These two applications removed
much of the fire from the Gympie lac/s attack. The
20th was reached with Godfrey always watchful and
the other man the reverse. Bradley’s downfall was
a matter of foolishly letting go his right. He is
terrifically strong for his size and of inexhaustible
stamina, as befits one born and bred in tropical
Australia, but he lacks Godfrey’s brains and tech-
nique.
Refereeing a fight may presently become
as aangerous as umpiring a football match. In
Rockhampton (C.Q.), recently, the arbiter had no
sooner crowned the contestant whom he deemed suc-
cessful when he found himself stopping a vicious
right from the uncrowned scrapper. The blow not
only outed the referee, but broke his cheekbone. Ihe
aggressive one lost his share of the gate, and was
a bit out of pocket as well when he was fined for
assault a few days later. His alleged reason for
cutting loose in defiance of all ring traditions was
that the referee had crowned the winner at the end
of the 19th round instead of the specified 20th.
Otto Nothling is probably the finest all-
round amateur athlete in N.S.W. Last year, in
Sydney premiership cricket he topped the bowling
averages with 12.78, his tally being 46 wickets.
He has played for N.S.W. and ’Varsity at Rugby and
N.S.W. at cricket, and won championships at
javelin-throwing and shot-putt. He came from
Queensland to Sydney ’Varsity.

“Pongo”: Chief Justice Herbert Nicholls,
at the annual meeting of the Tas. A.A.A. last week,
c.aimed that Andy Stuart had broken a world’s record
by 10yds. when, in 1886, at Hobart, he threw a cricket
ball 124yds., and he urged that the T.A.A.A. should
take steps to get official recognition of the feat. But
Andy’s throw was no record. In 1872, at Toronto,
Canada, Ross-Mackenzie hurled the horsehide
1401yds., and at a sports meeting in Sydney, on
Boxing Day, 1873, “King Billy,” an abo., did
140yds. Finally both these throws were skittled in
1884 by R. Percival, who at Durham Sands Race-
course (Eng.), threw MOjjyds.

In • the inter-’Varsity championships at
Melbourne last week Roy Harbison jumped sft.
Him. ; and nothing but the heavy state of the
ground saved L. H. Kelly’s old record of 6ft.
1 3-16 in. The Sydney crack also took the pole vault
with 10ft. 6in. R. L. Almond (Melb.) got the only
double—long jump (21ft. lljin.) and 120yds. hur-
dies (16 3-ssec.) ; and X- Dodds (Melb.) heaved the
hammer 121 ft. sin. Dodds put up 122 ft.. 64in.
recently in Melb. ’Varsity championships. L. R. M.
Ross (Melb.), who has a particularly taking action,
won the half-mile (2min. 4^sec.), and was second in
the quarter; and Jim McManamey (Syd.) won the
220yds. (24 3-ssec.) and was beaten by a foot in the
100yds. by C. V. Hallett (Melb.) in 11 l-ssec. Mel-
bourne won 9 out of the 12 events, and their points’
tally (23) was the largest in the history of inter-
’varsity championships. Sydney amassed 11 points
and Adelaide 2.

In H. M. Abrahams Cambridge has, per-
haps the greatest track athlete that has figured at
any English university. Against Oxford, last month,
he put up two records in one event: he won the
hundred for the fourth year in succession, and did
evens, equalling the record previously put up by
himself and three others. He added an inch to the
existing long-jump record (with 23ft. 7Rn.), and
won the quarter by three yards in 50 4-ssee., repeat-
ing the record of H. S. 6. Ashington, who in 1913
won three inter-varsity events on the one day.

“Kirk” : A boy who journeys to the State
High at Launceston (Tas.) on the morning train
from Deloraine and returns at night by the mixed, got
left the other evening at Perth. He set off down the
permanent way, and after a three-mile run overtook
the caravan at Longford. The locals are divided in
opinion as to whether the lad is a coming champion
or the Speck trains the worst on earth.
* * * »
“Mirza”: “Nimshi’s” par. re Hibernian
“leppers” (B. 26/4/’23) recalls that L. H. Kelly is
the only Australian amateur to clear more than six
feet. He jumped six feet at the Public Schools’
sports in 1911; and, a few months later, at a Maori-
land competition, he fractured all local records with
6ft. 1 3-16 in. Kelly also represented Victoria on the
half-back line at football. Despite a whiff of gas—
he was in the big dust-up from Anzae to Armistice
—he can still play a good game of football and
clear sft. lOin. He is on the teaching staff of his
old school, Wesley College.

Ernie Austen (scr.) walked 6 miles in
48min. 18see. at Sydney on Saturday. A record by
13sec. The winner of the handicap was J. G. Parker
(allowed 6min. 30sec.), an 18-year-old brother of
G. R. Parker, the Australian rep. at the last Olympic
Games.
* * * *
“Linesman”; The fact that a Riviera
tennis tournament is not always representative does
not detract from Suzanne Lenglen’s record triumph
in a recent Monte Carlo championship. Her first
three matches she captured without the loss of a
game, the fourth she won at 6 —l, 6—l, and knocked
out in the final the ex-Californian champion, Miss
Ryan, in two more straight sets, in which her oppo-
nent took only four games. Mrs. Mallory, the
American, whom Tilden persists in regarding as the
French girl’s equal, entered another Riviera up-
heaval against Suzanne, and she was numbered with
the slain in 22 minutes; which suggests fast,
ace-like play even for two love sets, consider-
ing the calibre of Mrs. Mallory. But the Yankee
lady never seems to have recovered from the alleged
affront when Suzanne retired during a close match
in the U.S. Every time she has met the Parisienne
since she has crumpled up badly, her worst perform-
ance before the hollow defeat aforesaid being a score
of o—6, I—6 at Wimbledon last year.
M.C.C., with Patterson and Wertheim as
their main suit, failed again in A Grade tennis,
against Grace Park, in Melbourne on Saturday. The
international pair won both their heats, but their
junior partners dropped their matches, and Grace
Park got home by a margin of five games. Mclnnes,
who has just left for the Davis Cup, hadn’t his old
accomplice, Fitts, in Uni.’s argument with St. Kilda,
wherefore the seasiders captured the four rubbers.
Sehlesinger, who is also bound for America, was Mal-
vern’s notable failure against South Yarra, for whom
O’Hara Wood was most conspicuous in securing a
three-to-one victory. Strangely enough, Jack Hawkes,
playing for Geelong against Brighton, wasn’t always
at home with Roebuck, .and their loss of one set in
each of their struggles with the enemy contributed
to Geelong’s deficit of two sets on the day.
Two brilliant performances were put up at
the 5.A..1.C. meeting on Saturday by Keith Bowman's
Denacre (Linacre —Lady Denman). In the City
Handicap he humped lOst. 21b. to victory in lmin.
27fsec. from 18 others. It was the best effort
in this race since Mala won -in 1911 with 9st.
131 b. Denaere appeared again in the Pnrkside Stakes
(9fur. w.f.a.), and only went under by a head to
Benoni (St. Anton —Rachael Mio). King Ingoda was
third. Another big performance was Haoma’s (Per-
sian Knight—Windlass) 10 lengths’ win in the two-
mile Kensington Steeplechase, carrying 12st. lOib.
Time, 4min. Msec. The big cross-country horse was
having his first run for nearly 12 months. Haoma
has 12st. 21b. in the V.R.C. 3m. lfur. Steeple, and
is a possibility.
* « * *
Toohey’s followers crashed badly at Can-
terbury, Sydney, on Saturday. He failed to land a
winner. Lion Isle, Lis
mount in the Handi-
cap, was a hot favorite
on the strength of his
recent win on the
same course, but was
beaten into third
place. Nine events were
put through, and only
one favorite (Una
Clift’s Rock Dove, in
the first division of the
Maiden) rolled home. 1
The tote “divvy” on
the Hurdle race, won
by Yandarlo, showed a
big margin between
the Paddock and Leger
machines: £6 3s. was
paid on the former for
10s., and £5 10s cn
the latter for a “dol-
lar.” Linacre was re-
presented by two win-
ners, Rock Dove and Sir
Bass.
J. UNDERHILL,
secretary A.R.C.
(Pony Club).
“Riverina”: Re bookmakers m M.L. (B.
26/4/’23). The difficulty of suppressing them is
a matter of juries refusing to convict. A law allowing
money to be sent to the tote by post would cut the
ground from beneath Mcßook’s feet; as it is, he
monopolises the patronage of those who do their
racing away from the courses. The bookies are far
from popular. They have a limit—say, £7 10s. —
which is rigidly adhered to even when a horse “pays”
perhaps £5O or over on the machine. Such bare-
faced robbery induces bitterness among the victims
of it, but under existing circs., if they out their
plunderers they will at the same time out their last
chance of having a bit on a horse.

Admetus (Maltster —Admeta) won Bris-
bane Thousand on Saturday at sixes. Carrying lOst.
31b. pver 7fur. in lmin. he has earned the
label of the best four-year-old Queensland has pro-
duced for years. Prince Popinjay, the crack two-year-
old, took the 6£fur. handicap with 9st. 71b. up m
lmin. 12J?ec. His sire, Popinjay, won Oakleigh
Plate with 9st. 91b. in 1914, and Caulfield Futurity
Stakes with 9st. lib. in 1912.

“J.T.P.” : Struck a small boy pal of mine
on Empire Day with a Union Jack neatly swathed
round a dishonorable portion of his anatomy. “What’s
the idea ?” I inquired. A deprecatory grin distorted
his villainous countenance. “Ginger Brown,” he said,
naming a considerably bigger lad, “has promised
to kick the seat out of my pants when he meets me.
I don’t think he would be unpatriotic enough to dis-
honor the flag, and I hope that by to-morrow he’ll
have forgotten I ever rocked him in the back of the
head.”

“Chiron”: Talking of the good old Long
Arm, at a recent Elwick (Tas.) meeting there were
two trots. They were captured by the same owner-
trainer-rider; the placed riders in the first finished
in the same order in the second; each winner
lowered his record by 6 l-ssec.; there were 23
starters in each; the divs. in the second were
£2 125., £2 12s. and £3 125., and each corres-
ponding place-getter was out of the same stable.

The lately-founded Archives Department
of 1 Adelaide Public Library has been given the
minutedbopk; of S. A. Cricket Association for the
first 11 years of its. existence. The Ass. had its
origin in a meeting of the Norwood Club in May,
1871, which resolved to ask , other city clubs and
Gawler (which, however, soon dropped out) to com-
bine. Then came an Act of Parliament, sponsored
by John Darling (father of the future Australian
XI captain), allowing the City Corporation to lease
a piece of the park lands for an oval. The minute-
book shows that “the ravages of locusts” were a
great trouble in the early days, and prevented Vic-
toria from being invited over in 1872-73. The first
match on the Oval was played in December, 1873.
and the following year it was ready for the visit of
W. G. Grace’s team.
“Spectioneer”: “O.lv.’s” axiom that a
good heavy crew must beat a good light one (B.
10/5/’23) is true of men, but with boys it is dif-
ferent. My experience in training boys both for
rowing and football is that a 17-year-old lad of
between 9st. and lOst. has a lot more dash and stay-
ing power than one of the same age a stone heavier.
A weighty boy is almost invariably either pulpy or
lanky—he sets and solidifies later on. He is often
strong and bullocky, but can’t stick it out with a
well-developed smaller lad of the same age. An old
trainer once put it to me that a big boy is soft
inside—his heart muscles aren’t set. The results
of the recent school regattas all heir out this theory.
Sydney Grammar eight, averaging lOst. 131 b., out-
lasted and beat Newington, averaging list. 51b. In
the first fours King’s (9st. lib.) beat St. Joseph’s
(9st. 111 b.) for second place. In the second; Fours
St. Joseph’s, the lightest crew on the river, won with
a final spurt, to which the heavier “Shore” crew
couldn’t respond. In this race “Joeys’ ” trainer
showed keen judgment. He wasn’t afraid to give
the stroke oar to a 9st. 51b. lad who knew how to
handle a boat. On the other hand, the “Shore”
people, looking for mere avoirdupois, turned down an
experienced 9st. 71b. lad who last year showed him-
self one of their best oars, and lost the race. And
then, on the Yarra, Melbourne Grammar gave Scotch
nearly a stone a man and a beating.
THE SUPER-SPORT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"Roy Governor, the N. S. Wales aboriginal who
recently declared himself an outlaw, is still at large,
and is being pursued by the police and hundreds of
private citizens.”
It’s delightful to go hunting where the eager kangaroo
Bounds briskly o’er the arid out-back plains ;
It’s a thrilling game to gallop through the bush the
long day through,
And with a kill take payment for your pains:
But how much more exciting the affair would be if
you
\V ere not the mere pursuer but his leaping prey, tiro
• ’roo!
Any ass can buy a handline and a pound or two of
bait,
And from a launch or yacht or open boat
Start to match his skill and tackle with the scaly
hordes that wait
Beneath the waves on which the anglers float.
Ihe role that calls for cunning is allotted to the fish
that, dishing his pursuers, misses frying on a dish.
•So, I fancy, argues Governor whose other name is Roy ;
Bored stiff with talk of politics and beer,
All a-yearn for those wild moments in which sports-
men find most joy,
His massive feet he’s been constrained to steer
Away from where policemen pace, and parsons
moralise,
And squatters argue about sheep ’mid clouds of dust
and flies.
1 envisage him up some tall gum as I indite these
lines,
His black but keenly sporting heart aglow,
While below a baffled trooper’s brow with perspira-
tion shines
As nervously he stumbles to and fro.
Boy’s life may be a short one; it may make the
righteous groan;
But that it’s one vast thrill, just now, the smuggest
saint must own.

That Elusive Something
By “PHLOX”
YOUR husband is flirting with a pretty
dark woman.”
“The wretch!”
"He’s asking her to take afternoon tea
with him,” went on the fortune-teller,
nothing abashed by her client’s interjection.
“Where are they going for tea?”
“I can’t tell you that, but at present
they’re dancing.”
“Is my husband dancing?”
“He is.”
"Oh, dear, what would you advise me to
do?”
“I did not undertake to advise you,
madam, but to tell your fortune. Ilalf-a-
crown, please!”
Mrs. Marsden left the fortune-teller with
rage in her heart and revenue in her soul.
Who was this woman, she asked herself, who
was usurping her husband’s affections? That
explained his attitude towards her lately.
He had begun to criticise her, and pass un-
complimentary remarks about her ligure and
her complexion.
Indeed, he had hinted that she was passe.
Why, then 1 was her husband and the
woman walking towards her. John has
recognised me, she thought; now I wonder
what he’ll have to say for himself. That
fortune-teller is certainly a clever woman.
“How fortunate we met yon, Mary. This
is Miss Heath —our supervisor of agencies,
who has done such good business for our
publications. We were just going to have
a cup of tea while we talk over business
matters, and it will be nice for you to come,
too.”
Mrs. Marsden gave Miss Heath a formal
bow, and a cold, “How do you do?” When
her husband said they would go to the Went-
worth fpr tea, she was more than ever con-
vinced that the fortune-teller was a witch.
The trio sat down at a table, and before long
Mrs. Marsden, succumbing to the charm of
Miss Heath, almost forgot her annoyance
and jealousy. Her, husband merely talked
business with Miss Heath, who from time
to time politely referred to Mrs. Marsden
for approval of plans she promulgated. And
when Mr. Marsden said that he would be
working back at the office that night, and
suggested that Miss Heath spend the even-
ing with Mrs. Marsden and regale her with
the latest Paris fashions, she was quite
agreeable.
Miss Heatlp the daughter of an Anglican
clergyman, was born and bred in Paris, and
having just come from the gay city, was able
to give Mrs. Marsden interesting fashion
notes.
Before long, however, the eternal feminine
asserted itself, and Mrs. Marsden wondered
why Miss Heath, with her charm and beauty,
baa never married. She told Mrs. Marsden
that the only man she ever loved was killed
on active service.
From this they talked of rejuvenescence,
the subject ever uppermost in the mind of
the woman who has passed her first youth.
“If only I could reduce myself,” sighed
Mrs. Marsden.
“You can, easily.”
“Oh, of course, the French know the secret
of remaining beautiful, practically for ever.”
“What I take to keep my figure slim is no
secret, Mrs. Marsden.”
“My dear, I shouldn’t have thought you
needed to take anything ”
“Indeed, I do; or I would soon fall into
flesh. Directly I find myself putting on
weight, I just get a package of clynol berries,
and take one after each meal.”
“Do they affect the heart?”
“Oh, dear, no; the most delicate person
can take them with safety.”
“I shall certainly take them, and I won-
der, Miss Heath, if you know of a good face
cream that doesn’t grow hairs.”
“Indeed, I do; and I’m most grateful to
the manufacturers for what it has done for
me. I never use anything but mercolized
wax. It is similar to the preparation used
by the famous French beauty Ninon
D’Enclos, who at sixty had the complexion
of a child.” • »
“How very fortunate I met you, Miss
Heath; I shall certainly add mercolized wax
to the list of things I want from the chemist.
Do you know I’m rather distressed about
my hair; it’s greying fast, and my husband
suggests that I dye it, but I hate the very
thought of dye.”
“I can assure you, Mrs. Marsden, there’s
no necessity to use dye. When I lost my
fiance my/hair began greying fast, but I used
Tammalite, and now you won’t find a grey
hair in my head —it simply worked wonders.
It’s quite simple to use. You just get two
ounces of concentrate of tammalite, and mix
it with three ounces of may rum. Apply to
the scalp at night with a small sponge until
the hair has gone back to its original color.”
“Thank you very much for the informa-
tion. May I ask what soap you use, Miss
Heath ?” i
“Certainly, I never use anything but
Pilenta.”
“It’s awfully , good of you, to be at such
pains to bell me about these delightful pre-
parations.”
“Not at all; I think it’s a woman’s duty
to contribute to the beauty, of the world,
and if you will notice, a woman who takes
pains wfith herself has that elusive sorne-
ti.’ng that is so fascinating. But it’s time
I was going.”
“I will send you home in the car. You
have given me fresh courage in life. I’m
now bent on cultivating that elusive some-
thing.” _

THE INKY WAY.
“G.A.C.”: George Groom, the bright young nun
who has gone to the Melbourne Herald from Bris-
bane Daily Mail, belongs to the third generation of
newspaper Grooms in this country. Grandfather and
father have both in their day run the Toowoomba
Chronicle.
“Jacky Roo” (Lond.) : A few months ago Austra-
lian artist Laurie Taylor won the Great. Western Rail-
way poster competition against many hundreds of
British entrants. He has capped this achievement
by getting into the first 12 in the Sketch £lOOO
competition for a cover design. It now rests with
the Sketch's readers to decide the winner.
“Pantagruel” : The cotton boom in Australia has
been responsible .for two new monthlies, the Cotton
Grower and the Cotton Farmer. The .former is
published by the British-Australian Cotton Associa-
tion, Ltd., in Sydney. The latter was founded and
is edited by J. G. Powell, an American now living
in Queensland, who has had considerable experience
as a cotton-grower in U.S.A.
“Barney O’Hea”: The N.Z. Tablet has been cele-
brating its 50th birthday. It was established by
the late Bishop Moran at Dunedin, and one of the
sponsors at its birth, Robert A. Loughnan, contributes
an article packed with interesting reminiscences.
The first canvasser was Tom Bracken, author of “Not
Understood,” who “worked” the tents, stores, hotels
and calico huts of the diggings with great success.
“Sniff”: Melbourne Herald continues to add to
its staff. F. W. Murphy, a light of the Westralian
branch of the A.J.A., has heard the siren voice of
the “Fink ’Un,” and Adam has dropped sub-leader
writing and dramatic criticism on the Aok to look
after Keith Murdoch’s leader page. And the throng
of sub-subs, subs and super-subs is waiting the arri-
val of an imported expert, Tom Clarke, from London
Daily. Mail.
“Peter”: Jack McLaren, the Australian yarn-
spinner now in London, has placed a racy • auto-
biography, “A South Sea Odyssey,” with publishei
Jonathan Cape, and it will be issued in October.
Cape was so impressed with the work that he signed
up McLaren for two more books on similar lines, to
follow at intervals of 12 months. As the author
has lived too long in the tropics to tolerate another
London winter, he will probably return to Australia
to fulfil the order.
“Alastor”: Pope Pius XI. has just proclaimed St.
Francis De Sales as “the patron saint of journalists.”
A book written by the saint and styled “Controver-
sies” is singled out for special praise, and the Pope
advises Catholic journalists to imitate the writer in
maintaining discussions “with vigor, together with
moderation and charity.” “Honesty and truth” must
lie the journalists’ watchword, and in particular the
weapon of “half-truth” must never be used. As
though any of us would ever think of doing it!
“Huffin-Guffin”: Tell “Osar” (B. 26/4/’23) that 1,
too, have, done acres of country press work in re-
turn for a free copy. I have been getting one rag tor
35 years on such terms. Record ? Again, some years
ago I wrote a column story and sent it to quite a
prominent provincial Victorian daily. It appeared in
the Christmas Day issue. “A Christmas box l of a
guinea at least,” I thought. 1 put in for it. “Not
the rule of this office to pay for outside contributions"
was all the Christmas box I got.
“Alkaloid”: Regarding The Bulletin’s ultimate;
resting place. I’ve seen it in some outlandish spots,
on pack-horse trails in the Cape York Peninsula.
(Q.), but 1 offer this as its “farthest outback.” A
survey party was doing reconnaissance work in Nor’-
East Westralia, and the camp was the only break in
an otherwise unrelieved monotony of sky and desert
plain. Star and sun observations to locate posi-
tions demonstrated to the party that they stood in the
centre of a circle devoid of all known habitation of
at least 300-miles radius. “Well, we’re the only
whites who’ve trod this God-forsaken country,” was
the chief’s comment. A day or- so later, when push-
ing on into the unknown, one of the forward party
happened upon the relics of an old pothole, by the
side of which a torn and tattered “Bully” kept
silent company with an empty sauce-bottle.
“’Strewth!” was all we said.
“Wessel”: Some new and startling information
about Papua may be found in Mrs. Charlotte Cam-
eron’s ; recently-published book, “Two Years in
Southern Seas,” The authoress (who was in ..Sydney,
last year), puts it on record: “Less than. 20. miles'
from Port Moresby cannibalism is openly practised.”
And there are other remarkable discoveries, e.g., that
an expedition organised by Colonel Boyce, the
Chicago newspaper man, penetrated a week’s march
farther into the country than any other expedition
had ever done, and all this in the course of a 31
days’ trip! Mrs. Cameron has good news for A. S.
le Souef and other naturalists in search of something
new, for she saw a box containing “enormous cobras,
their long bodies as big round as a man’s thigh,” cap-
tured in Australia. After that you are not greatly
surprised to learn that in the Auckland Museum they
have a Maori war canoe which accommodated 1000
men.
“Antibluff”: Thus the Illustrated Tasmanian
Mail on Australian writers: —
, “There are people w’ho argue that Australians are
capable of supplying a sufficient number of good
stories to fulfil the needs of Australian papers. But
this is not the case. Judging from experience, com-
paratively few stories are offered for publication,
and only a small percentage of these are worthy of
being used by a paper. The greater number of
Australian story-writers seem very young 0r... .
inexperienced. They cannot hope to produce stories
of equal merit to those written by men. . . .who have
been practising their art for years. It is... .our
policy to help Australian writers as much as pos-
sible. We have published two Australian serial
stories... .and have more than once published short
stories by local writers in our ordinary issues.”
Two facts which are known to me suggest a different
explanation of the Mail’s poor opinion of Australian
writers. For one short story it paid the author the
magnificent sum of one guinea, and for a serial story
£5. Up till quite recently it was its policy, at
least in some cases, as I know to my sorrow, to
reward the author by letting him see his stuff in
print. I don’t say that the stuff was worth more to the
Mail. But even if it wasn’t the fact does not justify
the paper in throwing this brick at Australian
writers.
“Wilfrido”: The late Mary Colborne Veel’s best
service to English letters was probably the early
Samuel Butler contributions unearthed by her indus-
trious research from the files of the Canterbury
(M.L.) Press, to which Butler contributed while
her father was editor. In the issue for December
20, 1862, she discovered his “Dialogue on Species,”
which was afterwards described by Charles Darwin
as being “remarkable from its spirit and from giving
so clear and accurate a view of Mr. D.’s theory.”
I have only seen Miss Veel referred to once by
Butler in his letters —in one dated March 3, 1902,
and sent by him to barrister O. T. J. Alpers, of
Christchurch. The letter runs:—
“When Sir Julius von Haast was here in 1887, I
gave him a complete set of all the books that 1
had published up to that date, with a request that
he would place them in whatever public library (I
rather think he named that of the College) was.
the most appropriate. I have often wondered whether
his death, which happened not long after his return
to New Zealand, might not have prevented the
carrying out of my intention. Since 1887 I have
written about as many books as 1 had done up to.
that date. Perhaps you or Miss Colborne Veel would-
be kind enough to see whether the books were placed
in any of the public libraries, and if so, in whichj
I shall be very glad to send a complete set (except
my book about Canterbury, of which I have only
one copy and which has long been cut of date)
or the balance of those that have appeared since
1887 in case the earlier ones are already in your
library. On being advised by you, or Miss Col-
borne Veel, or Mr. Triggs, as to what is wanted, I
will send them at once. I should perhaps say that
‘Unconscious Memory’ is a very scarce book-some
years out of print. I have only three copies.”
The set, I understand, was placed in the library of
Canterbury University College. Incidentally, a self-
written analysis of his book-sales shows that Butler
made a profit on only two out of his 14 published
works. This amounted to £77 2s. llld., as against
which the total loss on all of them was
£779 18s. lid.

"Tlie Faithful Heart,” artistically staged
at Melbourne Palace last Saturday, is a sen-
timental contrast to “Bulldog Drummond.”
Written by the author of “The Little Daino-
sel,” it is every way a brighter drama than
Monckton Hoffe had given Melbourne reason
to expect; for whereas “Damosel’s” moral
tone was low, the situations false and the
minor characters poor and unconvincing, the
situations in this case are forcible, the char-
acters interesting and the story “uplifting.”
The uplifts, though clumsily managed, should
make for popularity. The play, having its
heart in the right place, makes a wide appeal.
The plot may be so loose-knit that anyone
can stick a pen through it; the mawkisliness
of a certain musical-box episode, or two epi-
sodes, may he irritating to all but the very
simple; the dramatic strength of the story
may peter out in the epilogue. And stiil
“The Faithful Heart” is an entertainment
worth while. There is good dialogue in it;
the limelight is well distributed; one is kept
wondering what the hero will do next.
* * * *
To make his plot the dramatist places a
prologue 20 years in advance of the play, in
order to account for the unsuspected young
daughter who comes into Waverley Ango’s
prime of life. As a youthful sailor he had
been recklessly beloved by a tempestuous girl
at a seaport pub, and without dreaming of
fateful after-effects he went away and forgot
his amour. The affectionate girl died some
years later, having meanwhile taught her
little daughter to honor the name of her ille-
gitimate father, alive or dead, and to be as
good as gold. Waverley Ango, for his part,
leaves the sea to become a lieut.-colonel dur-
ing the war; he acquires a fine, manly love
for a Miss Diana, and a johnny brother
of hers and another relative favor his suit.
Then the dramatist proceeds to get his effects
by introducing the surprising daughter with a
letter from her dead mother. This is followed
in the next act by the father’s open confes-
sion that the girl now living with him is not
his niece, but his daughter. Whereupon
Diana raises much doubt as to whether she
will consent to be “Blacky’s” stepmother, or
whether the intruder will have to go to
Canada. While this question is still burn-
ing, a drunken ex-sergeant-major, with no
fault of character save his thirst, bursts
upon the scene. Waverley is then inspired
to close the great Diana question by escap-
ing to a foreign shore with the unfortunate
boozer Avho needs salvation and the daughter
he is so loth to part with. The excuse for
an ultra-sentimental epilogue is that Waver-

ley, in going back to sea, is obeying the same
mysterious sense of duty which caused mil-
lions of men to enlist for war service.
* * * *
All but two of a dozen parts, of various
sizes, are played in good to admirable style.
In the prologue Beryl Bryant puts consider-
able acting force into her passion of grief,
and pathos into her beautiful voice; but
Margot Lester, as a young sister, is always
unconvincing. Nellie Mortyne shines as a
respectably inebriate landlady, George Bel-
lamy shines even brighter as a bibulous
major, and George Mulcaster is duly breezy
as the sailor who left Beryl Bryant lament-
ing. Bar Frank Hawthorne, whose sketch
of the waiter in prologue and epilogue is
capital, Mulcaster is the only character that
appears again. As the otticah of 40 years
he looks well and acts better. His meeting
with daughter Blacky is impressive, his
manner with Diana is excellent, his treat-
ment of the sergeant-major is as pleasing as
the situation allows, and if Eve Gray were
only a half-convincing Blaclly he would
doubtless get more value out of the unsatis-
factory ending. Sylvia Shaw almost wins
the sympathy of the house as the elusive
Diana, who blows-hot and cold, and drops
out of notice before the house can make Up
its mind about her. Douglas Calderwood has
a fat little part, in which a johnny accent
and gentlemanly bearing are all the battle;
and Charles Road Night and others have
less to do than Lou Vernon, the unsober
soldier who, perhaps, errs in laying on too
much melodramatic color.
“Quarantine,” at Melbourne King’s, aims
at giving the heady appeal of calculated
naughtiness to a
bedroomy spectacle
of the “Scandal”
type. All else is
secondary to this
wayward ambition ;
but the trouble is
that the dramatist*
being thoroughly
respectable, goes
for the thrill with
the jollity of a
curate stalking a
man-eating tiger.

torn with entreaty and indignation, and
nearly makes an exit through the window in
her nightwear; but, fearful of exposing an
inch of bare instep in tlie process, she harks
back, her modesty preserved, to once more
face the graceless scoundrel gazing at her
tepidly from the end of her couch. The
climax is a weak but not incredible spoof at
the congregation’s expense, and the proceed-
ings leading to and following the main situa-
tion are merely prologue and epilogue.
* * * *
The first and third acts are infested with
characters who are either furtive spectators
of a suspicious attachment, or more disin-
terested pattermongers designed to present
an air of bustle and frivolity, but often
achieving through cheapness of personality
a curious feeling of vaudeville disquiet. In
fact, two of the passengers on the s.s. Angos-
tura, Edwin Brett and Edmund Duggan,
who provide a kind home for sundry cock-
tails, might be mistaken for a vaudeville turn
that has lost its way. Another creature,
with a waggling walrus moustache and
equipped with goggles, binoculars and a hot-
water bag, is hereby accused of being Ashton
Jarry s dumb caricature of a hypochondriac
taking a trip for the disimprovement of other
people’s health. Even Diana Wilson has no
appreciable contact with the plot, but glides
about with a wavy motion like a beauteous
spectre from Vogue, her natural contralto
entombed in an accent that seems to change
its nationality with every sentence. At her
warmest she appears an illusion of bloodless
captivation—a vamp dehumanised by lack of
victims. Rosemary Rees giggles, and Mildred
Cotteil expresses the hard, monotonous sput-
ter of venomous virtue in tracking down the
lovers; . the maid, Mabel Gower, shivers
appropriately in her anxious propriety;
Pirie Bush, as a reporter, is a shocking innu-
endo anent the unlettered condition of Ameri-
can journalism; and Edwin Lester and
Phyliss Ruthven butt in with superfluous
explanations near the close. The only people
who matter are Dorothy Seacombe and Law-
rence Grossmith. The Australian girl per-
forms prettily in places, though her tone
sometimes shows a want of preparation for
the full, fruity note of ardent invitation;
Grossmith’s voice sounds less improbable
than in his previous piece, “The Silver Fox.”
and he is much less inclined to manner his
remoteness from vulgar affairs. Here and
there also he is prone to release some of the
drama in his soul, and, under strong provoca-
tion from a fetching nymph, even proffers a
culchawed symposium of caveman character-
istics.
* * * *
A brief revival of “A Night Out,” at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s, is enabling Maud Fane
to Signal a second farewell before going off
to the Surrey farm of her dreams. Maud
re-appears in her old part of Marcelle, but
the abbreviated Percy now frivols with her
at the Hotel Pimlico and gamely endeavors
to wipe out popular recollections of Alfred
Frith in similarly festive circumstances. But
the memory of Frith abides like that of an
earthquake which threw people out of bed.
Percy, cheerful enough on more orthodox
lines, is disqualified for Frith’s extravagant
humor, because he does know what his face
is going to do next. Cecil Kellaway and his
four bonnie daughters are in the same state
of precipitate entry and exit, and Cyril Rit-
chard and Madge Ell ott are partnered as
before. The only fresh face belongs to Eric
Masters, who sings and acts in Paul Plt ti-
kett’s old role and is undeserving of censUi'6
for either.

in “Smil n’ Through,” and at the Princess’s
there will be one more week of “The O’Brien
Girl” ere “Tangerine” arrives.
Melbourne Town Hall will have Edward
Branscombe in charge for some days, com-
mencing next Monday, ,when a new organ-
isation of Westminster Glee Singers will hold
the platform. On the 16th Moiseiwitscb

“The Invisible Power,” released at Mel-
bourne Majestic on Saturday, shows Mother
Love in another devout aspect depictive of
American sentimentality. However, a pick-
me-up is provided in “Doubling for Romeo,”
which has some moments of genuine humor
and presents the Australian Sylvia Brelper
in the front line. Hoyt’s are Sctfeefiing “The
Flame of Life,” which might have the sub-
title of “The Face in the Shindy,” fob the
countenance of the chief miscreant in the
film is calculated to frighten any policeman
to death. Priscilla Dean endures the bound-
ing rages of the ruffian with her usual look
of heavenly resignation. “Ebb Tide,” some-
what according to R. L. Stevenson, chases
the foregoing on the same sheet. “A Connec-
ticut Yankee at Arthur’s Court,” taken
from Mark Twain, is the current whirl at
the Melba; and the surge of heroism in tne
juvenile Wesley Barry breaks out in “Heroes
of the Street” at the Britannia.

Another lady’s little show:—
In her collection of pictures at the Melbourne
Athenasum, Miss F. V. Lahey goes beyond the bounds
of prudence in striving for brilliant color-effects,
It is impossible to accept her water-color, “Sunset
on the Pines,’’ for instance, as a reasonable repre-
sentation of a rosy light on green trees. The achieve-
ment is too pyrotechnic. Likewise, in her seaside
sketches she almost indulges in (hild’s play with the
raw primaries, producing some simple elemental de-
sign that has about the artistic consequence Of
“Nellie Bly’’ on the orgah. Yet she presents an
impression of the over-painted Santa Maria della
Salute, Venice, that refutes any suggestion of tech-
nical incompetence; and there are others of the
same calibre. Her “Salute” is a graceful effort,
much lower in pitch that Arthur Streeton’s precipi-
tate view of the same scene. The artist has more
gravity and dignity in oils. “A Bit of Old Hobart”
and “Part of the Zinc Works, Risdon,” are very
pleasing performances in this medium.

Those who saw “Chu Chin Chow” iu Syd-
ney when the world was a few years younger
would not have thought it possible to cram
any more brilliance into it. Nor would
anyone have given Oscar credit for be’ng able
to cram any more Asche into himself. Yet
he has done both, with the result that each
is now a bit overcrowded. Socialism appa-
rently had no great hold on Baghdad—-money
has been lavished on some costumes and
saved on others. Whereas a band six inches
wide serves as the upper garment of some,
others are burdened with extraordinarily gor-
geous dress and headgear. But they all
seem happy. The popular “Gobbler’s Song”
and “The Prayer of the Desert” stand out
on the musical side —one of the strongest
parts of the show. “Chu Chin Chow” is
Oscar Asche at the thing he can do best;
that probably nobody else has ever been able
to do as well—-a truly wonderful pageant.
It is housed at the Royal.
At Sydney Criterion “The Cat and the
Canary” is still delivering the goods to those
who like their dramatic fare seasoned with
mystery and spiced with shudder.

the girl of their choice, Nell (Vera Remee),
is undoubtedly a stunner. The story, neces
sary, perhaps, as a clothes-line is on wash-

doesn’t very much interest anybody. The

In Herschel Henlere Sydney Tivoli has
one of the biggest vaudeville hits of the sea-
son, The long-haired FreUch-Canadian
signed on at the Castiereagh-street house last
Saturday, and it has been a scramble to get
near the fdflce ever since. He prefaces his
inelody-inakihg with a clever piece of whiliu
sical tomfoolery, and, getting down to real
business, shows how. “Home, Sweet Home”
would have been written by a dozen of the
great composers—from Chopin onwards. The
musical highbrow gets as much joy ottt of
this as the Philistine. Id the ragtime de-
partment he beats otit id breathless hurry
various popular airs, the ahdience singing id
accompaniment, but always liable to lag a

the piano ad engaging personality, and you
have the secret of Henlere’s instant success,

through three acts of tepid nonsense;
and hardworking little Audrey Knight serves
a neat line of character impersonations,

Sydney Lyceum, which is under the censor--
ship of local Methodism, is at present being
a devil of a fellow in company with “Omar,
the Tentmaker” ; and there is a dark hint that
the W.C.T.U. is going to upbraid its brother
over the old man’s jug of wine. The addi-
tional film is a strong argument for crema-
tion, most of the thrill being supplied by a
ghastly digging for a buried corpse. The
Strand lias two films in which kisses between
hero and heroine have to be cut short owing'
to the hustling nature of the story. They
are ‘‘Ebb Tide” and “The Speed Girl.” The
former is a screen perversion of a story that
R.L.S. had a hand in. Jazz garters and silk
hosiery flash when Mabel Nortnand bursts on
to the Lyric screen “Head Over Heels.” “Theo-
dora” with the 30 lions and an unemployed
demonstration of 25,000 Roman citizens is open
to approval or otherwise at the Rialto; and
Charlie Chaplin is keeping company with
“Lorna Doone” at the Crystal Palace. Norma
Talmadge is “Smilin’ Through” at the Globe.

“Norbell”: Sydney Majesty’s is to have
Sunday-night concerts, advertised, of course,
as “sacred and classical.” It recalls the
sacred concerts Harry Rickards used to give
at the Tiv. when he himself appeared in
“Chevalier Lyrics”—“ ’E Dunno Were ’E
Are” and such. The best Sunday concerts
I can remember were given at the Criterion
in the late ’eighties, when the pick of Syd-
ney’s artists sang, and Harry Teece, brother
of the A.M.P. magnate, was a strong card
with elocutionary items. Now that Sunday
shows are allowed at Her Majesty’s, I fore-
see an epidemic, and a busy time for “Indig-
nant,” “Churchman” and “Father of Four-
teen” in the daily papers.
“Cmsar’s Ghost”: The actors have now
secured the recognition of a principle which
a few years ago would have been regarded
as ridiculous. The Federal award is to be
amended so that extra payment will have to
be given for work done upon public holidays.
The Actors’ Federation is doing very well these
days ; but it has had a troubled history. In 1912
the first union was formed (John Cosgrove
planked down the initial entrance fee), but
when the theatrical managements set out to
crush the movement most of the prominent
thespians, who had good jobs to lose, kept
in the background. Those who stuck to the
union lost their jobs, and the organisation
died out. But, just when their insurrection
was being forgotten, the unionists joined up
with the tame Actors’ Association which
had been founded by the managements as a
counterblast to the original union, and
eventuall.v took charge. In the security of
the management’s own show a new organisa-
tion was evolved, ahd, Avhen time was ripe,
the Actors’ Federation- came forward and the
association was wound up.
“J.F.11.” (Lond.) : “Measure for Measure”
is, by universal consent, the most “unpleas-
ant” of all Shakspearean plays, and the most
difficult to present to a mixed audience. Has
it ever been staged in Australia? George
Rignold produced most of the plays during
his reign at Sydney Majesty’s, but I think
he fought shy of this one. However, it is
to open the annual Birthday Festival in the
Memorial Theatre at Stratford on April 23.
No doubt the recent successful London fort-
night’s production, of Shelley’s exceedingly
repulsive “Cenci” has had something to do
with this decision. Theatrical audiences can
stand anything in the sexual line now.
“The Mysterious Howards,” with their
“mental telepathy” act, were the b ; g draw
for Wirths’ Circus 20 years ago. Then one
of the brothers (Andy) died, and the wife of
■Tames took up his running. Now she also
is dead. She became ill when the circus was
at Merriwa (N.S.W.), and was left there.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Recent references to
Charles Kenningham remind that he was
not a young man when he came to Australia,
which is many years ago. He lost a son in
the war. I also recall that once, when a
well-known musical-comedy star-bounder was
boasting of his over-intimacy with a woman
who also shone on the Australian stage, Ken-
ningham pulled him up. Bluffskite was a
bigger man than the tenor, but the latter
said deliberately: “If you’re not a liar,
you’re a cad.” There was no_ fight. When
a proposal was afoot to give Kenningham a
benefit, he said he’d accept it if one of the
ordinary Gilbert and Sullivan mutinies was
made the occasion; but as it was proposed
to give a special matinge on a Thursday, with
free service by the artists, he declined. He
wouldn’t trespass upon his fellow-mfimmers
for an additional afternoon’s work.
“Ins” : Some of the vaudeville shows and
pitcher palaces in I’erth have started the
pleasant little game of raising their prices on
Saturday nights and holidays—week days,
Is. and 25.; Saturdays and holidays, 2s. and
3s. What a howl there’d be from Mr. Movie
Owner if he sent little Willie over to the
butcher’s on Saturday and the kid came back
with the news that prices had been doubled
simply because it was Saturday!
“Simplon” : While Irene Browne was scor-
ing a success in “The Gay Lord Quex” in
London (It. 17/5/’23), Winifred O’Connor,
another English actress well known to Aus-
tralians, was taking the ear of the town as
Polly Peachum in a sequel to “The Beggar’s
Opera,” at the Chelsea Palace. Miss O’Con-
PROFESSIONAL ADTICE.
PROUD MOTHER : “Don’t you think he is worthy of a course ? What shall I give him,
Professor ?”
THE PROFESSOR: “Ah, madam, poison. Poison is the most merciful.”
nor—who will be best remembered in “The
Chocolate Soldier,” wherein the tall and strik-
ing soprano was not moved to great warmth
by a somewhat negative personality—is ex-
hibiting a vivacity never suspected in Austra-
lia. Another version of “Polly,” originally
staged by Nigel Playfair at the Kingsway
and now transferred to the Savoy, has pro-
vided a fine opening for a comparatively
unrecognised actress, Lilian Davies.
“Old Timer” (N’York) hears some old-
time music:—
Somebody a while back mentioned Henry J. King
as the composer .and conductor of the cantata which
opened the Melbourne Exhibition of 1880. He wasn’t
—but he wrote the ode for a later year. The “Vic-
toria” cantata, the prize composition for the 1880
Exhibition, was composed and conducted by the late
Leon Caron, who won from a field of 30-odd competi-
tors. He wrote under the pen-name of “Aboriginal,”
and an ivory baton, gold-scrolled and surmounted
with a gnn-metal abo.'s head with diamond eyes, was
presented to him by the choir of 1000 singers and
125 instrumentalists whom he trained. He was also
given the job of musical director for the whole run
of the exhibition. Caron came to Australia as first
vio’in and soloist with the Lyster Italian Opera Co.,
and made his debut at the old Opera House, Mel-
bourne, where he played his fiddle between the acts
of the opera. Before the season ended he had lifted
the baton from Alberto Zelman, sen., and from then
on he put the Italian Co. through its facings. It was
following the Lyster season that Caron did the 1880
Exhibition work. Leon wrote another cantata, “Aus-
tralia,” considered by many a superior effort to his
earlier composition. But his best work is still un-
heard —“Mata Miti,” which contains some beautiful
concerted numbers. Caron also took a hand in the
opening of the Federal Parliament. He conducted
the orchestra and wrote the music for the ode that
was sung.
“Ramon Frijoles”: Dramatist Haddon
Chambers’s young widow married a retired
Air Force officer by name of Reilly the other
day. She used to be known on the stage as
Pepita Bobadilla, presumably because she
was born in Ecuador and christened Nelly
Burton; but she didn’t create much of a
disturbance among theatrical critics.
“Fleet Street”: “Treasure Island ’ has
scored its first century at the Strand (Lond.),
and is still going strong. Another striking
instance of “You never can tell.” The
experts were unanimous in declaring that
Stevenson’s yarn was a hopeless proposition
for the stage, being utterly destitute of dra-
matic development and love-interest. So for
40 years it was neglected or overlooked by
playwrights and managers, until it was taken
in hand by J. Bernard Fagan, whose drama-
tised revision has proved a goldmine for all
concerned. Arthur Boureliier’s wonderfully
realistic one-legged long Tom Silver is the
outstanding triumph of the production.
“J.F.11.” (Lond.) : Marie Lohr announces
the last nights of her “Laughing Lady” at
the Globe. Notwithstanding an inauspicious
opening, it unexpectedly caught on, and has
enjoyed a long, successful and profitable run.
Alfred Sutro must have found some compen-
sation in this for the comparative failure of
the piece he provided for Matheson Lang,
“The Great Well.” This had a first-class
send-off and a cordial press ; nevertheless, it
dried up in the most sudden and unaccount-
able fashion. Marie Lohr’s next production
bears the curious title of “Aren’t We All.”
These are the last words spoken, and their
significance depends on those immediately
preceding them. It is a comedy with a seri-
ous interest. Marie’s leading role is that of
a young married woman “who just misses
wrecking her life by an act of folly.” The
play is written by Frederick Lonsdale,
hitherto associated with the manufacture of
musical comedy.
“8.C.” : Dorothy Meikle, the young Mel-
bourne damsel whose good looks won her a
prize in the Melbourne Herald beauty com-
petition, lias found admiration awaiting her
in London. Visiting a film studio, as a
spectator, the other day, she caught the pro-
ducer’s eye, and was told that there was an
engagement for her on the spot. An agreement
was signed and she is to do small parts with
a view to bigger prominence later. Dorothy
had already done a little “crowd work” in
another studio, and had a few moments of
publicity with Fay Compton, the sister
of novelist Compton Mackenzie, who was
facing the camera in the movie version o
Hutchinson’s “This Freedom.’
“M.P.A.” (N’York) stirs the sawdust:
“Cserar's Ghost’’ was wrong in referring to Marizles
Wirth as Mrs. White (B. 11/l/’23). She is rs.
Martin, and is known in the business as Mrs. Martin
Wirth. The little, dark-eyed girl who did the fine
all-round work with the Bros.’ Circus was hi lied
as May Martin, but when Mrs. Martin presented her
in the U.S.A. she was billed as May Wirth, and
the show —which included Mrs. Martin as ring-
mistress, her daughter Stella, and Frank White as
comedian —was known as the Wirth Family, hater
Phil St. Leon joined up as riding comedian, and
Frank White became a vaudeville agent, known as
Frank White Wirth. Frank White married May, and
Phil St. Leon married Stella, a charming and re-
fined girl, who used to do an effective skirt dance
after being whirled from the back of a horse. Phil
St. Leon, one of the cleverest bare-back men in the
world, known as Philo, whose frolics in the Wirth
act in vaudeville keeps the house rocking with
laughter, is one of the old St. Leon family. He
will be remembered in Australia for his great make-
up as a lady rider whose somersaults used to aston-
ish the crowd.
“Wilfrido” : Hugo Anson, whose “Musical
Moments” forms part of Slcalski’s repertoire
in his Maoriland tour, belongs to a well-
known Wellington (M.L.) medical family,
and is one of the Dominion’s youngest com-
posers to be noticed in the Cold Country.
Following a severe motor-cycle smash, hc-
served three years as a temporary clerk in
the Admiralty during the war, and shortly
after published “Episodes de Ballet,’ for
which he was patted on the back by several
English musical papers. Anson holds a Cam-
bridge M.A. in addition to his Bachelor of
Music degree, and is at present the music
instructor at Alleyn College, Dulwich.
“The Deacon”: Goulburn (N.S.W.) isn’t
the only big town wherein play and player
have crashed (B. 24/5/’23). When Julius
Knight decided to try the country a few
years back Lithgow (N.S.W.) was selected
as one of the places for assault. Rumors of
miners getting £l2 a week no doubt helped
his desire to uplift the proletariat. _ We did
our best, too, with a civic reception, free
juice and speeches and everything to make
Marcus Superbus feel at home. But when
the show started the curtain-raiser was “The
Sacrament of Judas,” hitherto only produced
an odd time or two in England by Forbes
Robertson. The main piece was “David
Garrick,” but what little audience had
arrived began to drift out before that came
on, and the infuriated Julius roared for a
car to be got ready with his luggage from
the pub where he was to have stayed the
night and suppered—at our expense. As soon
as the play was over he stopped only to hurl
a brief but soulful curse at the night air, and
then fled to Katoomba. The winter breath
around Lithgow in the dead of night takes
some facing, too.
George 11. Chirgwin, who toured Australia
years ago as the White-Eyed Kaffir, left
£5956 when he died in London a few weeks
back.
“Hamfat”: If Auckland audiences
accepted without, disfavor Fullers’ “Business
as Usual” advertisement when old John died,
they have changed greatly. In the same
Opera House where vaudeville now reigns,
the two Majeroni brothers, under the man-
agement of Charlie McMahon, had opened
wliat promised to be a bumper season, when
the news of Signora Majeroni’s death filled
the papers with long obituary notices. The
show had a lot of dead horses to work off,
and after an earnest consultation it was de-
cided to play as usual, instead of closing
down for one night. It killed the season—
Auckland thereafter showed its disapproval
by staying away in large masses.
“Thersites” : George Leiteh was the most
cheerless comedian I ever endured. A slow
little man, with a whining, squeaky voice, he
was least depressing in such parts as The
Insect in “Paul Jones” or the Rev. Meekin
in “The Term of His Natural Life.” About
his most ambitious effort was Prince Mal-
leotti in “Forget-Me-Not,” with Genevieve
Ward in ’B4. He did the same part with
Janet Achurch in ’9l. But as a low com-
edian in his own egregious “Land of the
Moa” (’95), he was—well, George Leiteh.
His wailing gag, “I’m in another ’ole!” was
tiresome. That pretentious bellowdrama, by
the way, was saved from immediate ship-
wreck by the acting of such fine mummers
as Arthur Dacre and Amy Roselle, Madge
Corcoran, “Jimmy” Catheart and Cyril
Keightley. The Maoris, with Sophia, the
Rotorua guide, and the elaborate stage set-
tings, also helped to tide the affair over.
“Floater”: Aubrey Mather, who is play-
ing the dear old doctor in “Smilin’ Through”
at Melbourne Royal, has a rather variegated
stage record. He has, for instance, done
Dr. Rank in Ibsen’s “Doll’s House,” King
Claudius in “Hamlet,” Collins in Shaw’s
“Getting Married” and Sir Dennys Brough-
ton in “General Post.” He has even been
heard in the name part of “Othello,” and has
scored a hit as Jimmie Blythe in “Nightie
Night.” Mather, who made his first ap-
pearance at the Theatre Royal. Ilkeston
(Eng.), in 1905, is the brother of an arch-
deacon —and looks it.
“AND A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ask a p’leeceman if you want to Know the time,
Go to grandma for the art of sucking eggs,
Seek the laldheads in the stalls at pantomime
For an expert view on beauty-chorus legs ;
But the oldest and the wisest, oh, it is not much
he knows
Compared with little innocents who go to picture-
shows !
From the drawn-revolver etiquette of camps
To domestic privacies of lowly life,
From the cushioned couches patronised by Vamps*
From the errors of the temperamental wife
And her jealous hasty husband to the maddest slap-
stick stunt,
There isn’t much that’s wasted on the juveniles in
front.
“Educationals” they view with stony eyes,
They .are frankly bored by “scenic travelogues” ;
They rejoice to see a motor-car capsize,
And how they love the rogueries of rogues!
They’ve a languid tear for sob-stuff, watch a fight
with bated breath,
But to stir their frenzied cheering you must give
them violent death.
They are often dull at school and slack at play,
They are lacking in respect for parents dear,
And their ignorance on things of every-day
Is colossal, but their minds are sharp and clear
To follow all the niceties of conjugal despairs,
And how the villain traps the lovely maiden in his
snares.
The flicks may sometimes puzzle you and me
When the plot is spun too fast for adult eyes,
But the youngsters’ minds leap swifter than a flea
To spot the Sleuth in every new disguise;
So with humble trust we follow night by night to
folly’s fount
Where our little ones are learning All the Things
That Really Count.

BEAUTY.
Seven years ago the
Hudson Motor Company
designed a streamline
body. It was hailed as a
masterpiece of beauty and
design—so striking was it
that to-day a very large
percentage of the cars built
have adopted a separate
streamline body. A strik-
ing testimony to Hudson
leadership.
Beauty of bodywork,
however, is but one of the
many Hudson features,
which make it in all the
most respected car.

These qualities, taken in conjunction with the ease,
accuracy and despatch with which it can be placed in
position by even the ordinary workman, are among the
many reasons why B.R.C. Fabric is chosen by engineers
the world over.

Public Notice.
DURING the last South Australian elec-
tion campaign a pamphlet was circu-
lated throughout the Burra district and pub-
lished in the country press dealing with the
resignation of Mr. J. M. McDonald as Pre-
sident of the Liberal Union. This pamphlet,
which was authorised by Mr. William Ben-
ham Page, as Secretary of the Liberal
Union, contained certain statements dealing
with the events immediately preceding Mr.
McDonald’s resignation. The action for
libel commenced in the Supreme Court
against Mr. Page by Mr, McDonald in re-
spect of these statements has now been
settled on the following terms: —
1. The Liberal Union unreservedly with-
draws any statements which are capable of
being read to suggest a charge against Mr.
McDonald that he acted unfairly or dis-
honorably while President of the Liberal
Union.
2. The Defendant, as Secretary of the
Liberal Union, withdraws and expresses re-
gret for any such imputation that may have
been cast by such statements upon Mr.
McDonald’s personal character or his honor-
able conduct.
3. The Defendant pays to Mr. McDonald
all his costs and expenses of the action.
Dated this 2nd day of May, 1923.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS OF
The National Bank of
Australasia Limited
The Balance Sheet of the Bank as on 31st March last, and the Profit and Loss
Account for the year, which then terminated, are now Submitted to the Shareholders.
The net profit, after deduction of all expenses, etc., including £58,254 ss. 6d. for
Income, Land and .Note Taxes,
Amounted to £442,177 15 10
Add Balance brought forward from previous year 68,743 3 1
Leaving available £510,920 18 11
From this sum the following appropriations have been made:—
Interim Dividend of 10 per cent, per annum paid in November last,
out of the profits for the six months to 30th September, 1922 .. £136,250 0 0

£429,596 15 6
Carry forward 81,324 3 5
£510,920 18 II
Owing to the expansion of the Bank’s business, the Directors consider it advisable
to increase the Paid-up Capital by £500,000. To accomplish this they have decided to
issue the remaining 16,500 £8 Shares paid up to £5 and also 41,750 £lO Shares Fully
Paid, on terms which are set out in Circulars to Shareholders bearing this date.
As the 88,000 unissued £lO Shares are still referred to in the Memorandum and
Articles as “Preference Shares,” resolutions will be submitted to the Annual Meeting
which will in effect substitute therefor a similar number of new £lO Shares, of which the
proposed issue of £lO Shares will form a part.
A Resolution will also be submitted to the Meeting for the purpose of effecting the
consequent alterations in the Articles. This will require confirmation at a subsequent
Meeting, as set out in the formal advertised Notice of Meeting appended to this Report
and Balance Sheet.
During the year the following new Branches have been opened:—
/Camberwell, Collins Street East (Melbourne), Essendon,
/Frankston, Preston, Sandringham, Sunshine.

inued, and 5 established as Branches.
The Ordinary General Annual Meeting will be held in the Board Room at the Bank's
Head Office, Collins Street, Melbourne, on Wednesday, 30tli May, at noon, when the

Honorable Frank G. Clarke, M.L.C., who retire by rotation in accordance with the Articles
A Association and are eligible for re-election. There are no other candidates.
The Shareholders will also be called upon to elect two Auditors for the ensuing ye

King K.: Yuu set up a figure merely to
knock it down... .5.F.8.: Let your brains combed:
then you won’t spoil good stuff by such untidy
arrangement of it F.G.M.: Thanks for the sug-
gestion ; but it Wtfuld look too much like heaping
marmalade on our own plate 8.C.F.: Too far
from home. .. .Jack’s Daughter: Little girl, we
have burned your MS. Now go and burn the books
with whose veneered filth you have been filling your
simple head Laurie: See if you can’t put it into
a par.... A.E.K.: “Chastisement” is a fair idea;
but you might improve the handling.. .C.N. (S.A.) :
You drown your suggestion in a deluge of words...
Longshanks: Can’t see the humor... .L’Fou: A good
sketch; but you can put far better work into it....
A.M.: Worthless... .F.C.8.: You could write a read-
able rhyme'if you first got something to say....
. ...J.M.S.: But that trick has often been played.
....Bolling Flash: You’ll have to find something
newer than that Bunchy Top: In that respect,
anyhow, the Australian figures are at least not get-
ting worse. In 1914 44 p.c. of first-children were
born inside nine months of marriage, and 33 p.c.
inside eight months; in 1921 the proportions were
40 and 30 p.c. There are, of course, the ex-nuptial
births to be added to that lot. But our figures in
the latter respect, while half as high again in pro-
portion to unmarried women as those of Britain, are
much less than those of Austria, Germany, Sweden,
Denmark, Italy, France, Belgium, Norway, Spain
and numerous other countries... .Michael O.: Not
enough meat on its bones.... N.T.C.: You must do
better than that.... D.M.E.: A good idea; and then
you spoil it by trying to rhyme “scarce” with
“dress”... .M.8.1t.: Doesn’t get near. .. .Ivrin : Be-
gins well; see if you can’t make it end the same
. way.... A.R.G.: Only says the obvious thing, and
doesn’t say it well Yarra: Very weak, and as
thin as the shadow of last year’s dreams... .T.N.T.:
Too slight Hippo: No good Maske: You had
an idea, but the verse is too crude... .E.L. (Tarlee) :
Don’t mix the past and present tenses in that mad
fashion A.H.Y.: Not quite. .. .R.L.J.: It never
looked like a winner... .P.H.M.: Very poor stuff...
Disappointed Suitor: Our “poisoned ink” is nothing
to the red-hot grip of the office tiger’s teeth....
E.M.E.: That ground is too well trodden... .Efein:
Commonplaces in wooden verse. .. .Kat: Let the girl
make her bow: —
The only girl I ever want to hold
Is one that is purer than gold,
The one who drove the wild beast from me,
And gave in place a heart with a soul as company ;
One who made me turn my face
From cowardice and such disgrace;
One that lifted me (an evildoer)
To a life higher and truer.
Now when I am in trouble or doubt
To her I go (not curse or shout
As I did in the days that I was mad).
She soon turns me into the happiest lad,
And I go from her sobbing like a child
Because of the days when low and wild.
Yes, she’s the only girl I want forever by my side
To hold and love in this world wide.
. ...E.F.M.: There is the dust of the ages on your
idea. . . .J.H.8.: Your passionate love for the mother-
land staggers badly in verse... .H.F.P.: Jumbled
thought in sawn-off lengths of prose.... Werdmah:
That yarn turns up about eight times a year....
C. : Poer verse with small interest.. . .Evelyn M.:
Must be a lot better than that... .W.H.8.: Not lor
U5...J.F.8.: Blank verse must be much better; and
even then we don’t care for it.... Robin H.: Why
not try to write in English?... . J. 5.8.: Only enough
interest for a six-line par... .Harry J.: Long descrip-
tions of scenery in jogging verse are no. use to a
paper that has to get all over a continent in a week.
....Raupo: Not. up... .H.W.O. :• Not well enough
done.. . .Dear Tilda: Weak every way.. . .R.L.C.: Not
bad ; but read the paper and find out what we want.
.. .. J.K.T.: Make a study of a few good short stories.
.. . .Mollie N.: Nothing there. . . .Bellerive: The swag-
man doth jazzeth in :
“I’m weary,” growled a swaggie,
“Of trudging on the track,
And humming for a dinner
With a bluey on my back.
The bally world’s a riot
Of struggle, strike and miss,
But to a man upon his uppers
There’s better games than this.
When the stars begin to peepeth
You slip your bloomin’ swag,
And ponder, sigh and gabber
Like a witch-demented hag.
The cockies are humanists,
And easy understood,
For a feed of bread and mutton
’Tis ‘chop a stack of wood.’

THE NEW BEALE PLAYERrPIANO
for the Sel&Sxpression of Musical ideals
iJftSfell:
Ilf;-.:
tqf :
m
h- *'
css
H E appreciation of skilled musical per-
€ ® ji formance is, to most people, largely in-
stinctive. Without a mental training
that enables them to analyse the"wherefore”of
false rhythm, monotonous tone-colour and ex-
aggerated cadences, these disturbing elements,
nevertheless, are, when they occur, surely re-
cognised.
The performances which thrill and hold us
spellbound in an ecstacy of pleasure are those
wherein this general appreciation is raised to
high degree and served by an adequate
technique.
To many lovers of music whose emotions could
only be touched by an artistic performance,
the New Beale Player-Piano has brought un-
told hours of intimate joyi To prodigious
technique it links methods of control so delicate
and ready in response as to surpass those pos-
sessed by many masterly musicians. As Mr.
Oscar Asche has feelingly written, "it is im-
possible to express in mere words my appreci-
ation .... the tone of the instrument is
unequalled by any I have heard.”
One of the elements which so greatly contri-
butes to the better performance of the New
Beale is the wonderfully sensitive motor. It
operates on an almost incredibly small amount
of air and the response to every accented pedal
action is immediate. This frees the playing
from all sense of sluggishness, enabling the
most brilliant passage to be interpreted at cor-
rect tempo.
Approval of the tone quality of the piano itself
is a matter of unanimity with many talented
musicians. Amongst those who have, from
time to time, written to us enthusiastically about
the New Beale are Lindley Evans, Andre Skal-
ski, Arthur L. Benjamin, Frank Hutchens and
other concert artists.
If you, too, are one who is satisfied with noth-
ing but an artistic performance, you will find
permanent joy in the New Beale. It is sold on
generous terms and there is n© need to further
delay that closer friendship with the world’s
best music which its possession will so surely
bring to pass.
Encased in genuine hand-selected walnut, rose-wood, mahogany and other rarer woods
such as sycamore and satin-wood to order. Used pianos accepted in partial exchange.

“3leNag”: A wineshop on the Grafton-
Casino (N.S.W.) main road d.splays the
following notice over the bar : “This estab-
lishment is not in the tick area.”
"Geo. R.”: The Westralian fruitgrower
has a record apple crop and a dead market,
bor 193 cases one grower got a cheque for
£l3—^and the boxes alone cost £lO. At the
time oi the sale city retailers were asking
4d. per lb. for the fruit. Meanwhile Premier
Mitchell is howling at the top of his voice
for increased production!

"Pantagruel” : There are pretty fair plums
and pickings in even the poor parson’s trade
these times. Longreach ( W.Q.) has been inquir-
ing for a Presbyterian minister, offering him
£BOO a year, a manse, a motor-car and an
allowance of £lOO a year for its upkeep, to-
gether with one month’s holiday per annum.
Nothing to grumble about in that, surely.
The Black Swamp, near where the Finniss
runs into the Murray, is remarkable as being
the only place within hundreds of miles of
Adelaide that has too much water. A local
co - —which expects to have a good Eondon
backing—calling itself the Kingsland Irriga-
tion Co., has arranged with Joseph Timms
to build the necessary dam. The contract is
estimated at £lOO,OOO, and he is to take half
in shares.

"Zanthus”: While the old timers never
thought of using the fact to help float an o l
company, the discovery of bitumen on the
southern coasts of Australia was made a
Jong while ago. On April 2, 1827. Major
l.ockyer, then Commandant at King George’s
Sound (W.A.)j recorded in his journal, after
mentioning the great quantities of sponges
found on the coast: “There is also washed
up pieces of bitumen or pitch.” He thought
the sponges might prove a valuable article of
trade, but had no suggestion to make about
the bitumen.
* * • * *
‘ IJramao”: The price recently paid for a
S 1 * of land in Queen-street, Auckland—
£4l,ooo for a 33ft. frontage—recalls a sale
that took place 83 years ago, when part of the
site or the same city was purchased from the
Maoris by the British Government through
Captain W. C. Symonds and Major T. Ryan.
For 3000 acres the tribe got 50 blankets,
20 pairs of trousers, 20 shirts, 10 waist-
coats ,10 caps, four casks of tobacco, one
box of pipes, 100 yards of gown pieces, 10
iron pots, one bag of sugar, one bag of flour,
20 hatchets and a few coins to jingle.
“F. Clinton”: A few years ago an attempt
was made in the Wyalong and Scone dis-
tricts (N.S.W.) to rear Angora goats as a
commercial proposition. The venture failed
because there was not a market for goats’
flesh. Everything else —hide, hair, etc.—
sold well. .But the national prejudice against
the meat is apparently ineradicable, and the
only buyer was a Sydney canning firm. Their
prices did not pay the goat-farmers, and the
c S i? ess came to an end. Yet in most parts
ot Europe goat meat sells readily, and tens
of thousands of Australians have eaten it
and thought they were taking mutton.
... * * * *
“Kirbo”: When two motor-hearses, a
coffin-carrier and six taxis drew up outside
the ostentatious home of a Sassietv family
in Wellington (M.L.) the other day, the lady
ot the mansion sallied forth with some natural
curiosity and perhaps equally natural annoy-
ance, seeing that the services of oue hearse
were not required, let alone two. As she
emerged from the front door and stood forth
prominently, a photographer snapped the
turnout for advertising purposes. In the
finished product the chatelaine is depicted
the background, but in the controversy
that followed she occupied a very prominent
place.
u** * *
“*l sh, nead”: Direct overseas trade -with
the Tamar (Tas.) seems to have been estab-
lished at last, although the river was for
iong regarded merely as a muddy nuisance
connected with a journey between Launces-
ton and Melbourne. So far this year 23
tramps from the outside world have called
there to lift or discharge cargo—an average
of three a fortnight. The first company to
import oil and spirit direct from overseas, the
Texas Oil Co., is building a large store
close to the Launceston wharves, and will
next construct a special wharf. This will
involve probably a concentration of the
Speck’s oil imports via the Tamar.
* * * *
“Wart”: “Six and Eight’s” account of
o/- S /. r 4 ia s ’’ rst trawling experiment (B.
o/5/2o) reminds me that what was probab’y
the second was made from Launceston
■ f as -) in the ’seventies. Captain Ditcham,
who had had some experience in England,
imported a trawl net, and took a party in
the schooner Esk for a fishing trip in Bass
Strait. They dropped the trawl eiaht or
ten miles off Tamar Heads, in about 30
fathoms of water, and worked along the
coast to the west. When the net was pulled
up at nightfall, the result was a few hun-
dredweight of blubber, decomposed sponge,
shells, sand and half-a-dozen crabs. There
wasn’t a solitary fish.
* * * *
“Te Pana” on a Maori lfind deal:—
Since 1873 a party of Poverty Bay natives has
been consistently petitioning Parliament for the re-
turn of some 40,000 acres of land in that district.
The history of the claim dates back to the Hau
Hau rebellion. As a punishment, the Government
of the day proposed to confiscate the land of those
who had been in revolt. As some doubt existed as
to who were rebels and who were not, the chiefs of
the Poverty Bay district ceded a million acres and
let it go at that. The Crown then appointed mili-
tary administrator Briggs as a commissioner wdth
instructions that w'herever land in this area was found
to belong to loyalists it was to be returned. Briggs
soon turned in the job on the ground that it was
impossible to separate the sheep from the goats.
Meanwhile, Te Kooti, the fighting chief who had been
exiled to the Chatham Islands, escaped and threw
everything into confusion in the Poverty Bay dis-
trict by promiscuous use of the tomahawk and fire-
stick. The loyal natives became alarmed, and asked
for military protection. They got it in return for
20,000 acres of lard, on which some of the militia
from Taranaki could settle; but the whole land
question was in a badly mixed up state by this time,
and the natives have never ceased to allege that
from 30,000 to 40,000 acres too much fell into the
areedv white man’s rfiaw.

D. I. Freedman, the first Jewish chaplain
with the A.1.F., has just finished his 25th
year at the Perth Synagogue. Simultane-
ously he and his wife celebrated their silver
wedding.
If her memory and the family records are
what they should be, Mrs. Honora Mullins,
of Dayborough (Q.), turned 111 on May 1.
She is still strong and able to get about,
and has a walk every morning in her garden.
She lives with her son Denis, a youth of
07.
Mrs. A. Gough, of Nazareth House, Wyn-
num (Q.), reached her 100th milestone on
May 11. She was born in Tipperary, and
has put in SO years of her century in South-
ern Queensland. Apart from the fact that
her sight has become defective, the old lady
is very fit, and declares she’ll see another
decade through.
“Schnorrer” : A. Levy, who follows H. L.
Friedlander as minister of the Brisbane Syna-
gogue, comes from Port Elizabeth, South
Africa. He came to Australia spying out
the land some time ago, and Brisbane Jewry,
realising that they would need a minister
this year, grabbed him. Friedlander has held
the job for a long time, and is getting very
old. The Gentile custom is to refer to all
Jewish ministers as rabbis; but a rabbi is
one who owns a rabbinical diploma, and there
are only two in Australasia—F. L. Cohen,
of Sydney, and Dr. Abrahams, of Melbourne
(now retired). But Melbourne will have a
new rabbi shortly—l. Brodie, who is delay-
ing his departure in order to qualify before-
he leaves Sydney.
The parties to a watercourse quarrel which
is just coming into the courts in Adelaide
are the families of two State and Federal
figures of the last generation. Thomas Play-
ford was a market gardener, Richard Baker
(the first president of the Federal Senate), a
lawyer who made his home in the hills be-
hind Adelaide. The gully is now a public
reserve in its lower parts, reaching up to
the Baker estate. Several Playfords and
other gardeners are still on the upper
reaches, and J. R. Baker (himself a lawyer)
has issued a writ requiring them to let
the creek-water come down, instead of using
it all in their gardens. An indignation meet-
ing in the district has been largely attended,
and a subscription raised to fight the matter.
“ILK.”: George Howe, Australia’s first
newspaper proprietor, who founded the
Sydney Gazette on March 5, 1803, didn’t
merely print that sheet and such “extras”
as the Governor required. On Jan. 7, 1815,
be announced that “The Almanack for 1815”
was selling at the Gazette office, “price ss.
currency.” He also published that year “a
comprehensive spelling-book”; which recalls
that nine years previously he augmented his
slender income with an evening school.
Furthermore, Howe figured as one of Syd-
ney’s earliest Bungs, presiding over a Lower
George-street hostelry, and being one of the
20 persons permitted by Macquarie, in 1810.
to sell wines,- beer and spirits in the town
of Sydney. In 1813, however, the license
appears in the name of Mrs. S. Howe.
“Ex-Dig.” : The knife of retrenchment has
cut British Air-Commodore Samson down to
a place on the half-pay list. In his time
Samson was one of the numerous “mad
majors” of the air force —there were five, to
my knowledge. One of his exploits was wit-
nessed by the Diggers on the Messines sec-
tor. A daring Fritz air-pilot had made a
habit of coming over daily, sometimes several
times, flying low, to get a good observation,
and then streaking away before the Archies
could get busy. A trap was laid, and one
day the invader found himself cut off from
his own lines by a squadron of British air-
craft suddenly dropping from a height at
which they had been invisible. Samson him-
self was in another ’plane.which came out
to do battle. It was a ding-dong go until Fritz
got a bullet in his engine. Then he crashed ;
but although his machine was smashed (what
was left of it was promptly annexed by
souvenir-hunting Diggers) the German
escaped severe injury, and was taken pri-
soner.
“K.M.Iv.” meets another Digger:—
Bandon was a mystery. He blew in under arrest
one day at Moasear, accompanied by a wad of cor-
respondence—“ For your information and necessary
action, please.” The pay office had dropped to him
first. They had been paying him as a good Aus-
tralian for over 12 months, when someone accidentally
found out that he wasn’t on any A.I.F. list. Cables
to “Defence, Melbourne,” only confirmed Bandon’s
non-existence. Under a series of “interrogations”
he stuck closely to his tale. Hejiyas. a Mobile Vet.,
came out with the 2nd Reinforcement of the 2nd
Mobile Vets, on the old Blankshire, and had been
doing his duty ever since—largely in the Field Pun-
ishment Compound. Not that he was insubordinate
or had any other bad marks but an incorrigible
habit of celebrating Christmas right through the
year. I had him up and interrogated him some
more. “Yes, sir, I enlisted in Victoria at Richmond;
used to work at Mount Lyell, in Tasmania, before
that; came over in the Blankshire—’orrible trip we
’ad, sir—Captain Bilge he was skipper an’ the O.C.
troops was Major Staggers, sir. Me not on the
Nominal Rolls? Can’t understand it, sir! What
officers ’ave I served under ? Well, there’s Col.
Spavin and Capt. Glanders—’e’s in camp ’ere now.”
“Yes,” I said, “but that’s only this last 12 months.
What about the first year you were in Egypt?” He
had a bad memory, he explained; but he could bring
forward plenty who could swear he was on the
Blankshire. And he did. One man, however, said:
“ ’E’s been with the Vets, about a year. ’Armless
sort of old blankard. But ’e never come over with
ns on no Blankshire. I did ’ear ’e ’ad been with
the Tommies.” Later he made a clean breast of it.
His name was Murray, of the Royal Irish Fusiliers.
Yarning with Australians it struck him that six bob
a day was a long way better than one and three.
The Mobile Vets, appealed to him as a unit where
discipline was not likely to be over-onerous nor too
many questions asked. One night at Tantah he
slipped out of the guard room in a pair of slacks
and an Aussie hat, and was arrested next day by- the
M.P.’s at Kafr-el-Zayat. Giving his name as Bandon,
Mobile Vets., he was forthwith delivered at Moasear
to a confiding O.C. Vets., who, after hearing his tale,,
admonished him (anything to save trouble), and had
him furnished with a pay-book (the poor chap had
had his pinched by the Gyppos). “Why did I call
meself Bandon ? Well, sir, over the guard-room
door at Tantah there was a motto: ‘All hope abandon
ye who enter here.’ It sorter stuck in me mind, and
I called meself A. Bandon.” L, heard, of him only
once again. A letter arrived signed “Murray alias
Bandon,” thanking me for my “kindness,” and ask-
ing if I’d write him a “character” for post-war
use!

Ode Primordial.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SHE lies by me, as quiet as the swell
Of evening waters underneath the
moon,
Fragfant as any dew-pearled flower-bell
That with melodious morning is in tune.
Through thronging thoughts I cannot reach
the boon
Of sleep by craft of oft-repeated pray r.
When the Brute-Man turns restless in his
lair
There is no charm or chant may break the
spell.
She is too frail for these rude hands to
clutch —
Frail as inhabitants of tender spheres
Who pass in dreams and hold out hands to
such
As may be moved to laughter or to tears
By some sweet player’s clear and delicate
touch.
So frail is she I hover in suspense
Like some predacious bird with talons tense
That stoops to strike and hesitates and
fears.
I know not what I feared until the sharp
And querulous plaint from some mis-
mothered swine
In search of suck came to me, and a harp
Awakened in a tall wind-shaken pine,
And a wolf howled beneath a naked scarp.
I knew not till a great night-hooded owl
l’assed in its ghostly flight, and a deep growl
Rose from a lair enmeshed in hanging vine.
My mate is calling yonder by the sea,
Where light gleams from her cave like a
lone star.
My mate is calling, “Man, come home to
me!”
The wolf hears, and the prowling jaguar
Grouches more closely on his leafy spar,
For some forgotten fear awakes in him,
While the snake coils more tightly round
the limb,
And terror chills him on his gnarlhd tree.
Her eyes are yellow as a lion’s seen
In the red day when drowsing on a hill;
Her eyes are yellow with a shimmering green
That comes or goes, according with her
will,
As love is quick or vengeful hate is keen;
Her breasts are firm, her waist is lean and
long,
From heel to hip each muscle like a thong
Speeds her in flight or makes her swift to
kill.
Never with her were uneventful days.
Though hunger came anear with vexing
hint
Of vanished herds and stricken waterways,
Ever the faithful arrowhead of flint
Found a lean bird or some lone deer a-graze.
Such meat of game broiled on a fire, of dung
Rolled with new savor on a cloying tongue
Because of seasons clamoring of stint.
The thund’rous day has passed, the air is
sweet.
With forest odors and the scent of musk.
Oh, it is good to come on wearying feet
To see the roasting corn, swathed in its
husk,
And on the curling hide the juicy meat!
And sleep is good couched on the cavern floor
Behind the low and safe stone-shuttered
door,
Till light drives out the misty morning-
dusk.
Still, like a stranger, here that other lies
Who never pulled, for life, the kicking oar,
Who never lured the birds with siren cries,
Or dared the sabre-toothed foam-flinging
boar.
Here must she lie through seasons mild
and frore
Nightly, with Spring’s first violets in her
eyes,
Until Life’s tardy autumn earthward hies
And falling leaves whirl through our
cavern door.
Roofed in a painted house, crushed in a pen
With painted women like malodorous
flow’rs,
And eunuch-voiced and weak, fantastic men,
I count the slow, innumerable hours,
And I am homesick for that smoky den
Within the ocean-overlooking hill.
My mate is yonder, calling, calling still,
“0 Man, come home to our primordial
bowers!”
MAORILAND.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1 LEAF from the Moreton Bay fig-tree
over the seat fell on my knee and
A- V startled the soul out of me. That
I deserved the horrible shock didn’t make
it any less nerve-racking. Three weeks of
Sydney had done in a two-years’ cheque
earned at book-keeping for Grousey Williams
at Coota. Williams had sold out, and the
new man’s nephew' was going to keep his
books for him; so I got my cheque and the.
boot. I didn’t mind. I was pretty sick of
Grousey and his hungry place, and was glad
to be forced to make a change. But instead
of pouching my cheque and looking for a
job I got on a scoot in Sydney and stayed
on it till I landed in Macquarie-place with
everything pawned and 3s. Bd. in my pocket.
I hadn’t had a drink for a day and a half
when the leaf came shattering down on my
raw nerves, but I was still pickled and
jumpy. . „ ,
There weren’t any jobs for me in Sydney,
for one tiling; nobody would look at an
accountant “with country experience.” And
1 hated the sight and thought of myself, for
another thing; perhaps that helped the
advertisers not to look at me. I hadn’t ary
friends in the city except the fellows I’d
met on the scoot, and I wanted to dodge
them. I didn’t feel like hawking my badge
round to T. Emma or the Repat. or the Red
Cross or wherever it is you get these oh-be-
joyful helping hands. I didn’t* want to do
anything except tag on to _ some stranger
who wouldn’t ask any questions and who’d
give me a job of work.
Mr. Bardick settled it for me. I saw
him come into the park by the Bridge-street
entrance, and I looked the other way and
kidded I wasn’t there. But he stopped in
front of the seat and I had to look up.
“Hullo, Dick,’ he said; “what are you
doing in Sydney?”
For the life of me I couldn’t answer him
a word; just sat there like a kid caught
wagging. He sat down beside me.
“What’s up?” he asked in his sharp voice.
“Lost your job?”
Mr. Bardick was a friend of dad’s, and I
knew him when I was a boy. And—well,
I told him the lot: all the kinds of an ass
I’d been and what I was up against at the
moment. He didn’t say much, but the end
pf it was he told me to "meet him at Aarons’s
at 2 o’clock.
I found him smoking a cigar in the hall
and talking to a tall thin man with grey
hair. It wasn’t quite 2 o’clock, so I hung
about the door feeling rotten. I’d had a
shave and done my best with a clean collar
and a sort of a meal, but I was as nervous
as a cat. Presently Mr. Bardick came over.
“Come on, Dick. I’ll introduce you to
Mr. Coburn. He’s a countryman—Lithgow
—and he wants an accountant. Better take
it on if he offers it. And stay in the
country.”
Mr. Coburn had keen grey eyes which he
bored into me all the time he was asking
questions, and I had a feeling that he was
on to me. But I could feel, too, that he
was friendly; I supposed Mr. Bardick had
taken a risk and said a good word.
Mr. Coburn stopped talking business to
hold me up.
“You look sick. Have you been ill?”
I hesitated. But it was no good; my
nerve was gone. So I told him the truth,
too. I explained that it wasn’t a habit, and
that my last scoot (what you’d call a scoot)
was nearly three years ago. He looked hard
at me, but apparently he was satisfied. Any-
how, he laughed and said he’d been young
himself, and that it was rough if a man
couldn’t go on a bend and come off it again
back to work.
“But I’m not going home for a week. And
you want to start at once, don’t you?”
I said I did.
“Well, it’s no good your kickin’ about
Sydney for a week waiting for me, that’s
certain. And you can’t do any work on the
Greyfields books till I show you the ropes.”
He took his eyes off me and thought for
a moment. I found myself thinking what a
straight boss he’d make after two years of
Grousey. You’d be sure of a fair go.
“Look,” he said suddenly, “take this pound
in advance. Get a blanket and a billy ard
walk it to Lithgow. Take it easy—you’ll
be soft for a day or two —and you’ll just
about cut out the week.”
I stared at him.
“I mean it,” he said sharply. “Take the,
train to Penrith and footslog it from there.
Cut wood or something for your tucker and
sleep in the bush. All the booze’ll be out
of you by the time you get to work, and
you’ll be able to earn your pay.” He got
up. “See you in a week,” he added, and
went into the bar.
All the booze and most of everything else
had sweated out of me by the time I got
to Faulconbridge. It vras bonzer travelling.
As my nerves got better I began to real se
that I didn’t know anything about Aussie —
that I hadn’t seen anything of her in the
30 years she’d been keeping me. I’d never
seen the light widening and growing stronger
on the bush at daybreak, or felt the night
close in round my fire and me alone in the
world. I’d never felt the still, hot m'dd'iy
silence, a sort of splendid vacuum at the
heart of the day. Coming out on the ridges
above the gorges I saw that I didn’t even
know black from .white, that I’d been color-
blind till now. Millions of things kept com-
ing into my head, things that had never
bothered me even in France, things I can’t
put into words. Being fit, and feeling the
freedom in your feet and in your lungs, not
caring a damn, letting dawn wake you and
rolling up at sunset with the rabbits and
the b'rds —oh, millions of things!
Early in the morning of the third day I
found an old swaggie sitting over his fire
bes’de one of the b ; g waterholes on the
Linden-road. Tethered near by was a young
black horse. The man looked up when he
heard me on the road; his old face was
wrinkled and wind-bitten and brown, and
his eyes sparkled out of a fringe of white
beard and white hair.
“ ’Ullo, mate,” he hailed; “ ’ad yer break-
fast?”
“No,” I said; “I was going on a bit first.”
“Come ’n’ ’ave a bite. The billy’s just
on the boil.”
I unhitched my bluey and got out my
pannikin. He took the billy off the fire,
strung three rashers on a bit of wire, and
held them in the flame. I can smell them
now.
“Coin’ far?” he asked, watching me get-
ting tied up -with a rasher and a bumpy
crust of bread.
“A mile or two beyond Lithgow.”
“Not used to the road, are yer?”
I told him it was my first trip and why
I was swagging it to my job.
“Yairs,” he said, “I used to booze up a
bit years ago—a good bit, too, one way an’
another. But yer get tired of it, yer know,
tired of it. I’m going up to Orton, the other
side of Bathurst. Shall we travel together
as far at Lithgow—you bein’ not used to
it an’ that —it’d be comp’ny?”
I said I’d be glad to.
“We c’n put both swags on Black Lassie
an’ travel free —it’s ’ard goin’ on the moun-
tain roads in summer.”
We rolled up the swags and went across
the road to the tethered horse. She was a
beauty, black and gleaming, fine ard shapely
as a ballet-dancer. I’m not a judge, but I
know the rough of the same, and I could
see that the o]d bloke had got no slouch of
a horse with him. She was a bonze, as clean
as a whistle and as light and dainty as a
greyhound. I said so.
“Ah!” His eyes flashed and he seemed
to drop 20 of bis 60 years. “Now, there’s
an ’orse, she is.” He slung the swmgs ten-
derly over her blanket and put his arm
through the halter. She was a bit fresh,
but she answered his murmuring voice, and
took the road with us gently and easily, like
a lady.
“But y’ ought to ’ave seen ’er grandmother

Are You Dull, Achy —“All Out of Sorts”?

Don’t let that dull, constant backache discourage you.
Worry will only make it worse. The sensible plan is to
find the cause and correct it. That nagging backache
may be Nature’s way of warning you that all is not right
with your kidneys.
When the kidneys fall behind, the blood becomes over-
loaded with uric acid and other poisons. You suffer
daily backache, and a tired, weak, all-worn-out feeling.
You feel nervous and depressed; your head aches; you are
dizzy and annoyed by bladder irregularities.
You want to be well, and the best way to get well is to
give the weakened kidneys the help they need. Just take
things easier for awhile, and help the weakened kidneys
with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. Doan’s have helped
thousands and should help you. Ask your neighbor!
TESTIMONY FROM SYDNEY PEOPLE.
TWO PERMANENT CURES.
Mrs. S. Drew, 30 Briggs Street, Camperdown, Sydney, says: “Some
time ago my kidneys were in a seriously disordered state, and in consequence
I suffere'd terribly. My back never stopped aching, and I often used to feel
I could ha<rdly- bear it any longer. The pain took all the life and energy
out_of me, and I was almost crippled w-ith the ailment. Dropsical swellings
showed on my legs a>nd ankles, and there was puffiiness under my eyes. The
state of my health, worried me terribly, and as I had taken _ all sorts of
remedies without deriving any benefit I was beginning to think I would
Sever be well again. However, to make a long story short, at last I got
Doan’s,Backache Kidney Fills, and they proved a godsend. The first couple
of bottles eased my suffering a little, .and seven bottles of the pills cured me
completely. The backache has gone, the dropsical swellings have disappeared,
and I feel splendid. I have pleasure in recommending Doan’s Pills to all
kidney ''sufferers.”
Mr. John Simmons, Dutton Road, Bankstown, says:—“For some years
I suffered dreadfully froto backache and kidney trouble. I was under a
doctor for a good while, but his treatment did not benefit me very much.
A friend of mine heard of a wonderful cure by Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills, so he urged me to try these pills, and I decided to do so. After taking
one bottle I felt very much better, and as I kept on with them the improve-
ment was maintained until finally I was completely cured, and I have not
had a sign of backache and kidney trouble since. Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills have my hearty recommendation, and I hope many will benefit by my
experience and give them a trial.”
Five years later Mrs. Simmons says:—“My. husband has had no return
of his old complaint since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured him some
years ago. Wfe always keep this medicine in the house and find it a most
beneficial tonic for the kidneys.”

looked after me an’ nursed me an’ put ’is ’and
down for everything I wanted. When I was
better of it l‘ owed ’im about £2O all told,
Well, I ’adn’t got 20 bob be then, an’ I was
only ’alf alive, as yer might say.”
Lassie rubbed her muzzle against his
shoulder and he crooned in her ear. “Tellin’
a yarn about yer granny, m’dear,” he told
her soothingly, as if she were a baby.
“So I give ’im Diamond. ’E’d been tryin’
to buy ’er for years, an’ ’e’d saved me life
near enough, so I thought ’e’d earned ’er. I
went up the Northern Tablelands after that,
doin’ a bit o’ shearin’ an’ that, an’ it was
years before I ran across Fred again. But
last week ’e wrote me a letter that ’e’d done
well with Diamond, racin’ ’er in the country
an’ breedin’, an’ that if I cared to come an’
fetch ’er I c’d ’ave ’er grand-daughter Lassie
for a present.”
He turned to me, his eyes alight.
“So I got me Diamond again, in a manner
o’ speakin’. Yer see,” he dropped his voice
to a confidential note, “she’s property, she
is. There’s blood in ’er: Negress an’ King
Gauntlet an’ All Set—’er sire was Prince
Vane. Oh, she’s pedigree,” he added solemnly,
as if I’d questioned it.
“An’ I’m not gettin’ any younger—there’s
a day or two’s work in me yet,” his eyes
flashed defiantly, “but I’m gettin’ on, an’
I’d a notion that Lassie ’ere c’d look after
me old age. Goin’ to take care of yer old
man when ’e’s past it, Lass?” he asked her
so naturally that I almost waited for her to
answer.
“Delaney c’d train ’er—’e’s a couple 0’
miles from where I work—an’ ’e’d come in
on ’er with me. I got a good job as ’a-ndy
man at Mi-. Wickham’s; I c’d look after
my share, all right. Not Sydney, o’ course
—'not that she ain’t good enough—but there’s
always plenty o’ country meetin’s. An’ you’d
get a name. An’ . then, p’r’aps, yer might
get the money put up for Sydney.”
The old cove’s heart and soul belonged to
Lassie more than she belonged to him. Three
times he woke me in the night messing round
to see if she was all right; I heard her soft
whinny and his caressing voice through the
trees.
Next day we boiled the billy about
mid-day beside a fence. Farther down there
was a little gate with an arch of rough tim-
ber over it. dn arch shaped like a big wish-
bone. On the top rail of the gate the name
of the house was painted: “Haven.”
He looked at it and spelled it out.
“’Aven? What’s that mean, mate?”
“Oh—a harbor for your ship, a shelter,
It means you’re safe.”
He looked impressed. “A shelter—does
it now? * ’Aven’—makes a nice name for a
place, don’t it?” he said half to himself.
He turned back to the swag he was un-
rolling. “ ’Ere. mate,” he said suddenly,
rummaging in his bag, “I clean forgot it—
we’re out 0’ tucker. Plenty o’ tea but no
tucker. We’ll ’ave to forage.”
The white gate caught his eye.
“What about cuttin’ a bit o’ wood for
’Aven? Let’s go an’ see.”
A short, stocky man looked up from a
flower-bed as we appeared.
“No,” he said, “the wood’s cut for weeks,
And I do me own odd jobs.” He smiled at
us. “But there’s a stoo of rue own cookin’
just cornin’ off the stove. Come and put
your knees under the table and have your
nicker shipshape. The missus is away.”
His garden w T as as neat and exact as a
page of copperplate double-entry; it was a
shame to walk on the paths. All the beds
were bordered with shells of the same size;
I couldn’t have ruled a straighter line than
they made. The paths were bricked and
spotless. There wasn’t a stone to be seen
in the soil; there wasn’t a flower or a tied-
up rosebush that was a half-inch out of its
place. Even the stone dog in the centre of
the big bed seemed to be square.
The house was just as bad. Its cleanli-
ness and neatness were frightening. My old
mate went back and wiped his boots a
second time on the mat before he’d go into
the kitchen. Our host took our hats and
put them in a little magic cupboard behind
the front-door, a cupboard which seemed to
open and close itself.
But the man wasn’t fussy. He was hearty
and kind—big-voiced and laughing. Two
kids came in, a little girl and a lame boy of
about 12. The boy was pale and quiet; he
hung his head forward as if there was some-
thing wrong with his back. But the girl
was full of life. She bustled about and set
the table while her father leaned over the
stove. When it was finished she looked it
over.
“All’s well, skipper,” she sang out.
“Thankee, bo’s’n,” he answered, ladling
stew into the plates.
All seated, he threw his eye over us.
“Er” —he said, and bent over his plate.
The kids followed suit, and so did we after
a moment. It was good stew and the knife
and fork and table were a change from the
camp-fire and the road.
“Pass the salt, please, skipper,” the little
girl said.
He passed it and smiled half-apologeti-
cally at us.
“That’s her mother’s fault,” he said; “I
was a seafaring man and she calls me
‘skipper.’ So the kids have picked it up.
Sorry you missed her—she’d have given you
pie as well as stoo. But she’s been down in
Sydney for a few days.” He looked grave
for a moment and glanced at the boy.
When we’d done, the bo’s’n started to
clear the table and the skipper asked if
we’d like to see the place. He had about
an acre under cultivation, and the produce-
garden was as shipshape as the flower-
garden ; you wouldn’t think a leaf would
dare to grow crooked. The house was fibro,
and he showed us where he was building a
little enclosed side-verandah on to it.
“So the boy can sleep in the open,” he
said. “It’s about him the missus went to
town. I thought there might be a chance”
He stopped and sucked at his pipe.
“I got a letter from her only half-an-hour
ago, saying she’s coming home to-night. She
went down to see this Dr. Brodie Taggart
about Bill’s spine. He’s my wife’s first
husband’s boy, but he’s as much to me as if
he was mine. This doctor’s got an operation
—a long job, but it puts the curvature right
in the end. He told her he could do it if
it was done soon—Bill’s nearly 13—and that
it would cost £4O for his fee. So that outs it
and the missus writes to s - H’s
knocked the wind out of me a bit.”
“Now. that’s a thing I never c’d under-
stand.” Lassie's owner was indignant.
“ ’Ere’s an ’igh-up doctor who knows ’ow to
do a thing an’ ’e goes an’ puts a price on it
that ’ardlv anyone can come at. What s
che good o’ that?”
“I dunno what’s the good of it,” the
skipper said, "but I know it’s got us in the
neck. It’s rough, too. We had dirty weather
nearly all the way till a year or two ago.
I’d been at sea since I was 12, in ill-found
ships and hungry ships and Scotch scrap-
heap ships—a rough spin all round. And
the missus had been wood-and-water joey on
her father’s farm till she’d married a man
twice her age to get out of it. And he was
a boozin’ old lubber who made her life a
hell so that she couldn’t stand him after a
couple of years. She took her _ baby and
went down to Sydney to earn a livin’ some-
how—anyhow—and left old Macintyre to
drink himself to death.”
“Skipper ! Skipper !” came from the back
door. "Want an apple?”
“Yes ! And bring some, for me friends.”
“Well, he did die and she was shut of
him. I found her barmaidin’ in George-
street one time when I was ashore, and I
started saving me pay. And in time we got
married. She came up here with Bill, and
I stuck to the sea for a bit for the pay.
But in the end I was able to chuck it and
join hex'.”
The little girl came and gave us an apple
and a smile each. My old bloke asked her
what her name was. “Betsy Anstey,” she
chanted, and ran away. We got up and
followed her into the house.
“All that was hard going; rough pretty
near all the way. But for the last few years
it’s been good, with only poor Bill’s curva-
ture to spoil it. Forty pounds! I’ve got
less than twenty in the bank and I’m only
half-way through paying for the place yet
—I can’t x’aise a bob.” He sighed. “The
missus’ll be down in the mouth, all right.
He showed us some ’boardship contri-
vances of beds and washstands that let
down, window-seats which were chests, and
so on. He was very proud of a semi-circular
window-seat in the front l'oom and took us
in among the wax-fruit and antimacassars to
show it off.
“This’ll be your wife; mister?” my mate
asked, stopping before a framed photograph
on the table.
“Yes. It was taken years ago when she
was still Mrs. Macintyre, but it’s like
enough now.”
“Ah, well” —the old man straightened up
and held out his hand to the skipper—
“we’ll be gettin’ on. Thank yer for yer
kindness.”
Bill was coming out of the kitchen as we
went down the hall.
“Good-bye, m’ boy.” He held out his
hand again.
“Good-bye,” the kid said, taking it and
smiling up at him.
In Katoomba he said he had some business
to do, and he went off with Lassie. Half
an hour aftei'wards he came back without
Lassie.
"‘Look, mate,” he said, “I’ve sold me ’orse
to old Arthur Connolly. ’E give me £3O for
’er. Will you” T , , „ . , *
“Sold Lassie! Good Lord. But waat
about your old age, the race-meetings,
and” , ,
“Oh, well,” he cut in impatiently, there s
a day or two’s work in me yet. Look, will
you put the money in an envelope an 961111
it to the boy at the skipper s? I m no scholar
at writin’.”
“But you can’t do that!
“Why not?” . ...
“Well, it’s cheek for one thing; a
stranger coming into the house and then
sending money!”
“Well, they wouldn’t, know who it come
from. And I ain’t what yer’d call a
stranger, if yer to that.”
“What d’you mean?” ,
“Yer see,” his dry old voice fell a tone,
“me name’s Macintyre.” ■
For a moment I didn’t get it. Looq
God!” I said, when I did. '
“Yairs. A lot o’ people thought I died
that time. It’s funny ’ow get about.
I dunno ’ow you look at it, but it to
me it’d be a pity to let ’em know now.’
I got a thick envelope and in silence we
walked to the post-office, where he handed
me the three notes.
“Just put a bit o’ paper round em, he
said, “that’s all.” ~ , „ T . , ,
He leaned over my shoulder while I printed
the address in my best style. He recog-
nised the name of the house.
“Makes a nice name for a place Aven,
don’t it?” he said half to himself.
HILARY LOFTING.
A Ballad of Delight.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I who have loved from time to time
Full many a Flo and Bet and Sue;
I who have known the lisping chime
Of sighs and kisses not a few;
I who have tasted fire and dew
Of love’s surrenders without end
Am fain to range my loves anew —
I sing the goodness of my friend !
A woman yielded (gold or grime)
Still spurs one’s mood. Be she a shrew,
All out of tune and out of rhyme,
Once is enough. But there’s a brew
On other lips. Eyes brown or blue,
Or grey or green, their sweetness spend
Not vainly. Yet, while tabbies mew,
I sing the goodness of my friend !
Far heights of dalliance we climb
Till paradise swims into view ;
But lust’s a trollop and a mime;
Full many a love-song goes askew.
Light ladies spice a naughty stew
That to promiscuity may tend.
One love alone brings me no rue—
I sing the goodness of my friend!
Old pal of mine, thank God for you!
To meads of peace our footsteps wend.
Whate’er we dream or dare or do,
I sing the goodness of my friend!
